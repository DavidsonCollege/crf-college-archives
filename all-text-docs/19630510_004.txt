Spends Four Decades Here

BY BOB ADAMS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“Fais bien ce que tu fais; ne fais rien a peu pres! is the motto which meets the

eye as the student strides into Chambers 209 for another day of French. Next fall,’

however. the motto and the diminutive French tricolor may remain, but Dr. A. V.
-Goldiere will have retired from his professorship in the French Department, and a
new personality will move in to extol the grandeur of the Continent.

A dedicated scholar at 68.
Goldiere will be teaching basic
French next year in the Insti-
tute for American Universities
near the Mediterranean coast of
soutnern France.

It would be unfair, though. to
say that he’s bored with the
sedate life of this small college
community. In fact, the David-
son of today presents a cosmo-
politan appearance compared to
the town in 1922 when Goldiere
first began teaching. At that

companion were selected from
their ‘unit to remain in France

versity of Caen. This experience
influenced -Goldiere to shift his
academic interest from Latin to
French.

Student Council Retains
Power Of Interpretation

The Student Council voted to retain the power to interpret articles seven and
eight of fhe Student Body Constitution, which deal specifically with the Honor Sys-

tem Wednesday night.

For the third time in as many
weeks. the subject. dominated
the discussion in the unusually
long council meeting. Having
been put aside during last
week's meeting. the issue was
taken from the table in this
week's session.

The motion essentially states
that the Honof Court be given
the power to interpret articles
‘seven and eight of the Student
Body Constitution. The Court
technically does not have this
power at the present time.

Former president Danny

Carrell claimed that the Hon-

or Court was hampered with-

out this power in its trials

and could not act fairly in a

case. Carrell has been trying

to get his idea across to the
council for more than two

that he felt the entire issue lay

“Other members of the council
pointed out that the council
should have the power to inter-
pret its own constitution. Fol-
lowing a lengthy discussion by
both sides, the motion was da
feated.

Student Body President John
Spratt said .after the ‘meeting

in the interpretation of the pre-
amble the constitution. -

In other business, the council
voted to retain membership in
National Student Association for
the coming year. Before the vote
was taken., however, the council
discussed whether to allow the
student body ‘to décide on the

took a workman most of the
day, however. to pick up the
shreds of tissue from the lawn
in front of Belk.

“It looks as if we will have
to go back to cheaper toilet tis-
sue,” Mrs. Moore mused as she
thought over the situation. (In
1957 Mrs. Moore honored a
Student petition for better qual-
ity tissue.)

Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts reserved comment on the
matter. only to express concern
that such riots can develop in-
to more serious and hsrmf{ul
occurrences.

The Davidson Colleze Wind

and the fire-gutted hulk of the
old Chambers Building rendered
the Davidson scene more akin
to Reconstruction Days than to
the Roaring Twenties.

Goldiere, however, has held
much affection for both the col-
lege and the town since he first
came to Davidson. He empha-
sizes that he first came here on
a one-year contract and could
easily have left had he not liked
his surroundings. ,

A native of Massachusetts,
Goldiere was graduated from
Dartmouth and was doing grad-
uate work at Yale when he in-
terrupted his studies to begin
teaching here. He’s accustomed
to interruptions and delays

five xeats to advance past the
seventh grade. .

be a clear violation of the ethics
get up by the American Associa-
tion of University Professors
(AAUP),” he said.

Goodykoontz said that he had
initiated local AAUP action in
a desire that the college's action
in his resignation be investigat-
‘ed. but that he was bound by the
chapter here to make no com-
mént at the present time for
publication. He added that the
administration's action in ac-
cepting his resignation with a
mere three weeks left in the
semester proved their “indiffer-
ence” toward his students.

During this week six mem-
bets of the faculty cir-
culated a petition calling for
support of the administration's
decision in the Goodykoontz .af-
fair. Dr. J. W. Reid, one of the
six, told THE DAVIDSONIAN
tnis morning. “We contacted full

professors. associate professors..

. aod assistant professors. We did
41ot quite see all of them. how-
‘ever. It (the petition) was sign-
ed by both a majority of the
reople contacted and by a mia-

jority of the faculty.”

In explaining their motiva-
tion, Reid said, “We felt this
man—Johnston—wes feeling
pretty much alone in making
this decision, We just wanted
to tet him and President Mar-
tin know of the faculty's sup-
port.”

Reid explained that the six
men. Dr. C. J. Pietenpol. Prof.
Bradley D. Thompson, Dr. E. A.
Beaty. Dr. Malcolm Lester, Dr.
W. G. McGavock, and himself,
felt “the majority of the faculty
did support the president” and
that for that reason they decid-
ed to draw up a petition. “We're
happy to say that only a very
few contacted were unwilling to
Sign.”

President Martin had these
comments today on the action
by the faculty: “I was. of course,
gratcful for this kind of expres. |
sion. It certainly. means a great:
deal 10 me to see them express '
their confidence in this way.”
Martin also said that he does
not plan to use the petition “in
any way” untess the Board of
Trustees wishes to bring the
matter up. “A sizable majority
of the faculty signed it.” he said.

When sit-of you go to Kurope during your summer vacation,
you will certainly want to visit Spain, where the tall corn grows,

‘The first thing vou will notice upon entering Spain is the
absence of sibilants. In Spain “s” is pronounced “th” and
thereby hangs a tale. Until the reign of Philip IV—or Guv
Fawkes, a3 he was sometimes enlled —Spaniards said “s” just
like everybody else. Philip IV, however, lisped, and Spaniards.
baving an ingrained sense of propriety and not wishing to em-
barrass their monarch, decided that everybody should lisp. This
did indeed put Philip IV very much at his ease, but in the end
it turned out to be a very bad thing for Spain. It wrecked the
sassafras industry—Spain’s principal source of revenue—and
seduced the nation to a second-class power.

as

aA ty

As a result, Spaniards were all forced to turn to bull fighting
in order to’keep body and soul together. Today, wherever you
xo in Spain—in Madrid, in Barcelona, in Toledo, in Cleveland
you will see bulls being fought. For many years the -bulls
hive sought to arbitrate this long-standing dispute, but the
Spaniards, » proud people who use nothing but Castile soap,
have rejected all overtures.

It is therefore necessary for me. to explain bull fighting to
anyone who is going to Spxin. It is also necessary for me to
say a few words about Marlboro Cigarettes because they pay
me for writing this column, and they arc inclined to pout if I
ignore their product. In truth, it is no chore for me to sing the
praises of Marlboro Cigarettes, for I am one who fairly swoons
with delight when I come upon a cigarette which gives you the
full, rich taste of good tobaccos plus the pure white Selectrate
filter, and Marlboro is the only smoke I have found that fulfills
both requirements. Oh, what a piece of work is Marlboro! The
Bavor reaches you without stint or diminution. You, even as I,
will find these statements to be happily true when once you
light a Marlboro. Marlboros come to you in soft pack or Flip-
Top box, and are made only by the makers of Marlboro.

But I digress. Let us return to bull fighting. Bulls are by
nature bellicose creatures who will keep fighting till the cows
come home. Then they like to put on pipe and slippers and
listen to the “Farm and Home Hour.” However, the Spaniards
will not allow the bulls any surcease. They keep attacking the
bull and making veronicas—a corn meal pancake filled with
ground meat. Bulls, being vegetarians, reject the veronicas
and then, believe you me, the fur starts to fly!

To be perfectly honest, many Spaniards have grown weary |

of this incessant struggle and have left their homeland. Co-
lumbus, for example, took off in three little ships—the Patti,
the Maxene, and the Laverne—and discovered Ohio. Magellan
later discovered Columbus. Balbon also sailed to the New
World, but he was silent on a peak in Darien, so it is difficult
to know what he discovered.

Well sir, I guess that’s all you need to know about Spain.
So now, as the setting sun casts its rosy fingers over El Greco,
let us take our reluctant leave of Spain—or Perfidious Albion,
as it is jocularly called. Aloha, Spain or Perfidious Albion, aloha!
