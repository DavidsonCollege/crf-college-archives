A brand new column, with a new name
and under a new make-up, to start off the
new staff! For no reason at all, except that
it has always been done, we were forced to
change the name of this weekly sports com-
ment, and make some change in the looks
of it, just to show it was new, and it wasn’t
the old sports editor who was writing it.
Protection for those departed, so to speak.
We haven't as yet been able to find a suit-
able name, and it hardly seems likely that
the above title will continue to appear long.
Like Davidson’s healthful Piedmont weather,
it is subject to change without notice.

With Whittle doubling in brass and as-
suming the stellar role, the Wildcat track
team staged a regular Davidson fighting fin-
ish up at Raleigh last week and stole the
track meet right out from under N. C.
States nose, after it looked as though the
affair was in the bag for the Technicians.
After taking all three places in the javelin
and still needing two points to make them
even with the Wolfpack, Joe McCall and
Whittle came through with first and sec-
ond, respectively, and made the final score
65% to 60%. Quite a jolt to have your meet
yanked out of your hands like that.

Whittle entered five events, won three of
them, and got a second and a third in the
other two. His nineteen points easily made
him high point. man. Besides winning his
favorite races, the hurdles, he also came in
ahead in the century. Then he entered the
220 and got a third, and to taper off, placed
second in the broad jump.

Only one more home meet for Tilson’s
and Pritchett’s performers before the State
meet on May 3. Wake Forest brings a good
team down Saturday afternoon to try to con-
tinue their bothersome winning streak over
Davidson teams this spring. The meet will
mark the last appearance on the home paths
for five members of the squad. Whittle, Bro-
hard, Lafferty, Joe Gardner and Gene Smith
will all graduate in June.

Davidson has a good chance to duplicate
its feat of last year by coming in second on
the State meet with a like finish this year.
Carolina, with one of the strongest teams
in its history, stands out as overwhelming
favorite to win by virtue of its showing in
the recent Tech relays, and in dual meets
won by large scores from Georgia Tech,
~ Penn State, and others.

Track fans will all focus their attention
on Philadelphia this week-end, where the
Penn relays are held tomorrow and Satur-
day. This annual carnival is one of the best
in the country and always has on its entry
list the cream of the nation’s cinder artists.
Numbered among the three thousand. en-
tries this year are George Simpson, holder
of the world's record 9 2-5 second for the
100-yard dash, using starting blocks, and
Hamm, Ga. Tech broad jumper, who won
the Olympic jump -in 1928. Ninety-nine
events are carded.

The enterprising baseball manager, Ladd
Mills, has scouted around and gotten five
more games for Monk’s willow swingers.
These will prolong the season a full week
longer than was formerly expected, and give
Davidson three more Big Five contests this
year. One more gate has been arranged
with Carolina, to be played at Chapel Hill,

Davidson Teams to
Engage in Tourneys

Golfers Play at Sedgefield—Tennis
Team at Carolina

Both the Davidson golf and tennis teams
are entered in State elimination tournaments
this week. The tennis tournament which was
begun last wek at Chapel Hill was _post-
poned by rain, and play was not resumed un-
til today because of matches that the Wild-
cat netmen had scheduled in Virginia dur-
ing the earlier part of the week. The golf
team plays Duke on Thursday, the Uni-
versity of North Carolina on Friday, and
participates in the State tournament Satur-
day at Sedgefield in Greensboro.

Captain Frontis Johnston and A. N. Hal-
verstadt, stars of the Wildcat netmen, have
fought their way to the quarter-finals of the
singles and will resume their play today
against Yeomans, Captain Merritt, Hendlin,
and Liskin, of Carolina, and Frank and
Phillips of Duke.

The Wildcat golfers will strike stiff com-
petition this week at the State collegiate
golf tournament.

Chapel Hill boys, who won the tourna-
ment last year, are especially strong, since
every one of the varsity members of the
squad have returned, in addition to Goodes,
a sophomore, who beat out last year's cap-
tain for a place on the team, The strength
of Duke is practically unknown since they
have not played many matches so far this
year, but they are expected to send a strong
