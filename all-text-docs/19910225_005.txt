No Respect

Sadly, last Wednesday night Coach Bob McKillop broke tra-
dition. He did not start seniors Darry Strickland and Turner
Gilmore in their last home game. Although Darry played for
several minutes in the final game against Campbell, Turner was
given a measly 49 seconds on the court. How embarrassing.

Davidson prides itself in graduating 95% of its basketball
players. Here, a basketball player is the true scholar-athlete,
working diligently on the court and in the classroom. But aside
from the heavy academic load at Davidson, Darry and Turner
have experienced a particularly tumultuous four years in their
basketball career: leaving the Southern Conference, playing as
an independent and a changeover of coaches.

If Jerry Tarkanien of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas
can start six seniors at their final home game and take a technical
foul for such action, the least McKillop.could have done was to
play Darry and Turner for a ceremonial minute ortwo. He did
not grant the respect both these individuals deserved. We ex-
pected better of him.

Farewell .

This commentary marks the ecoghusien of an editorship that
has witnessed debate on such issues as feminism, homosexual-
ity and the state of athletics. But beyond all the collegiate con-
troversies, one event stands clear: the Persian Gulf War.

Before the bombings began.on January 17th our generation
was able to boast for two decades that it was free of war. Of
course, there have been minor conflicts in the past, but nothing
compares to what is happening now. -

It was our hope that by the time we relinquished our reigns of
the paper the war would be swiftly over. That has not been the
case. Last Saturday night President Bush announced that “the
liberation of Kuwait had entered its final phase.” Now that the
ground war has begun we can only pray for the safety of our
troops.

One reporter for the New York Times wrote in an —
before the war began, “Every generation is molded by its war.”
We as students face the opportunity of bein g molded by the
critical events that are occurring right now. For this reason, the
new editors are encouraged to continue publishing dialogue and

coverage of the Gulf War as they begin their term for the Pac

Prof. Levering Corrects Article

To the Editor:

I wish to point out an
error in the story in the Feb»
ruary 11 issue relating to the
peace vigils sponsored by
the Davidson Friends Wor-
ship Group.

The story suggested that
I had been “organizing” the

gathering. In fact, the vigils
have been organized by the
worship group as a whole,
with much of the publicity
being done by Heather
McGarrah and other students
involved with the group.
One other point: the
overall quality of The
Davidsonian has been very

high this year. Keep up the
good work!

Sincerely,

RALPH LEVERING
Associate Professor of His-
tory

Time Out Coach McKillop

Dear Coach McKillop:

Hey coach, is that how
you’dlike tohave ended your
four years as a Davidson
College basketball player? I
think not. By effectively not

playing Turner, a man who -
has played hard his: whole
Davidson career, you
showed him norespect. You,
coach, lost a lost of credibil-
ity and respect with the fans

that watched that game. I
hope you regret it because
you should.

Davidson Has Diversity

Miss Davidson:

Davidson seems (correct
us if we’re wrong) to pride

itself onits diversity. Please -

refer to the interview of the

| school’s .president in. last

week’s paper. Diversity is
one of our strengths here.
Call us left-wing commies,
but we believe in that diver-
sity. And we believe in free
expression. It’s as an Ameri-
can as the Bill of Rights.
And you, we suppose.
Anyone who can write
can publish in the
Davidsonian. Why don’t
you start acolumn? Do you
have something to say? If
you did, however, why
would you need to say it?
Everyone else is proably
thinking the same thing.

We’re all exactly-alike here..

Right?

A few facts.for your
files: -
The word “homosexual”
(and the horrific apocalytpic

vision that word brings trail-
ing behind) appeared in the
Davidsonian a few weeks
ago -- for the first time in
overa year. Gosh. What
will those lefties do next?
Start the Renaissance?
Like it or not, feminists
(few radical), gays and les-
bians (none out, because of
fear) go to your school. So
do blacks, people from for-
eign countries, liberals,
conservatives, and wankers.
They get degrees, just like
you. Some even think of
themselves as human, de-
serving respect, or at least
human rights. Gasp!
Davidson is. far. from
liberal. You are correct to
point that out. The “per-
spective” knows that, too.
He reads National Review.
He’s asmart boy. Ifhe only

looks around, he’ll see that

at least one hundred people
in the cafe look exactly like
him. Don’t worry. He’ll
come here. And, no, he

won’t write for the paper.
He’Il be on the Court witha
beer, just like you said. He
won’t feel uncomfortable.
Unless he’s a closet femi-
nist. Or gay. Or black.
Davidson has a motton:
Alenda Lux Ubi Orta Liber-
tas. Therearetwo key words
in it. Libertas is Latin. It
means “liberty.” Whether
that interests you or not, the
school was founded with that
concept in mind. Lux is

: Latin, too. It means “light.” .

Lux is often translated
loosely as “learning.” Work-
ing thatconcept(sic, sic, sic)
into your Davidson career
might behoove you.

We look forward to
hearing from you and yours
1,120 duckboot-clad com-
rades in future issues of the
Davidsonian.

Davidson Has Character

To the Editor:

As a recent visitor to -

your historic campus of
Davidson College I became
aware of several concepts of
what the Davidson experi-

ence means to those cur-

rently enrolled and those
who have graduated. Two
young women currently
enrolled - one in pre-med
(though you don’t call itthat)
and another a writer/thinker/

philosopher - had great
praise and appreciation for
what’s found here. You have
great teachers and skillful
and caring administrators.
On the two films we saw -
artfully and meaningfully
done - graduates told of the
scholar-athlete emphasis, the
training of musical talents,
the development of commu-

nity spirit and other values..

Mingling with other parents

and my daughters, the men-
tor ofexecellence here made
me want to tell the worl¢: so
here is that attempt to share
the news: Davidson grows
character, scholarship,
disicipline and friends.

Sincerely,

JEANNE BROWNING
