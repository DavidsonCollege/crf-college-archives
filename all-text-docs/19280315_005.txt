Freshmen Firing First

Rounds On Long Range|

First Week, Only Preliminary
Work .

This week in accordince with the regular
R. O. T. C. schedule, the freshmen began
their .30 calibre firing on the 150-yard rifle
range. A large group of some 60 or 70
men went out Monday afternoon while the
other groups are reporting at the range dur-
ing the rest of the week,

The firing this week, 10 rounds per man,
is merely for the purpose of practice in the
use of the rifles, the scores -not counting on
the semester average. Next week, each man
will be required to make a minimum score
of 43 onut of a possible 50, in order to quali-
fy; failure to do so will mean continual fir-
ing until the required score is made.

The third and final week of range firing
will be a contest to determine the best shot
in the freshman class, and it is thought it
will certainly cause some keen competition
for the coveted honor.

All the range firing is under the super-
vision of Lieutenant Beckett, who has charge
of all freshmen this year. Men are required
to report at the range promptly at 2:40 p. m.
on the days scheduled and must remain until
5:00. During this time men are assigned to
coaching or pit work, according to the need,
_ in addition to their regular firing. A tele-
"+ phone system enables the firers to communi-
cate with the pit-men.

Thus far, most of those who went out to
the range expecting something really “dan-
gerous” have characterized the whole thing
as rather “tame,” while others expecting a
“crip,” came back with sore shoulders and
complaining of the “terrible” recoil.

ment of the negative. The main points pre-
sented by the negative were, (1) that the
present policy of the United States was
justified by international law; (2). that the
affirmative had pictured the existing condi-
tions much more seriously than they really
were, interference by force of arms only
being used as a last resort, when all. other
measures had failed; (3) that the Monroe
Doctrine obligates us to protect European
property and lives; that it is a part of the
American policy and is recognized as such
by European countries; (4) that the clause
in the query stating “except after formal
declaration of war” made the affirmative
present declaration of war as their plan, and

“The rapid growth in the popularity of OLD

One of the leading tobacconists in

it was pointed out that the evils of this
plan were clearer than the other, considerable
time being necessary for the declaration of
war, and this virtually meaning that the gov-
ernment refused to protect the property of
its citizens in foreign countries.

Much interest was shown in the question
by both the debaters and the audience. This
is the last debate of the year that will be
held in Davidson.
