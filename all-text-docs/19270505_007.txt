Extensive Alumni
Program Planned

|

| ——_——

| Alumni “have been returning to David-
son from year to year of their own ac-

with no one to direct them or to see that
|their wants were satisfied. Officials of

of {the Alumni Association this year, how- |

| ever, are planning to make a change, and
| will make an effort to reserve a dormi-
| tory for the use of alumni while on the

campus, and have a central place to stay,
jas well as using other methods to make
| them feel at home.

|
|

Class reunions are being stressed, those
lof 1877, 1882, 1887, 1892, 1897, 1902, 1907,
| 1912, 1917, 1922, and 1926 being scheduled
lto return to Davidson. In order that an
invitation might reach each one of them,
| the alumni secretary recently mailed out
| addressed sheets to all of the classes, ask-
}ing for corrections on the addresses of
| individuals, and of any others that they
| might be able to give. As a\result, many
| new ones have been obtained.

has been

| Some member of each class

jasked to write a letter, inviting their
| colleagues to be present at commence-
| ment time, which is in addition to the
| general invitation that will be extended
jto every alumnus. The lists served this
| purpose, as well as giving opportunity for
feach man to learn where his classmates
| were located.

| Registration prior to their coming will
| be asked of each alumnus, enabling the
jauthorities to make arrangements ahead
}of time, giving them an idea as to the
| approximate number who will be present.
Badges will also be worn by each in-
dividual, giving his name, class, and pres-
jent address, so that all classes will be-
|come better acquainted, and each in-
dividual will have opportunity to learn
the other Davidson graduates.

It is planned to utilize one of the dor-
| mitories which will have the least num-
ber of student occupants during the com-
mencement as a place for the former Da-
vidson men to stay. It will be arranged
according to classes, those of 1877, 1882,
etc., being on the first floor and on up ‘to
the top, where the recently graduated
will be placed.

Many other details are being worked

out for the entertainment and comfort of
men who will return to their Alma
Mater.

\Students, Register

Registration of the students for next
'year has not been completed, according
to Registrar Hengeveld, and will prob-
jably not be completed until the latter
| part of this week.

The members. of the rising Sophomore
class have not completed their registta-
| tion, but it is though that the enrollment
j will about «telly with that of the Sopho-
| more class of this year. According to
| Statistics received from Mr. Hengeveld,
ithe enrollment for next year will be
| practically the same as that of this year.
| An unusually large Junior class has been
registered, as 103 men have already sign-
ed up for Junior work. This will limit

as this year’s fresh class, or about 240
men.

The Junior class for next year- will be
the largest that has been in the college
for several years. Besides the men who
have already signed up, there will be a
few newcomers, who will raise the total
enrollment to to about II5.

Since the date on which the registration
fee is due is not until May roth, an exact
report of the enrollment will not be is-
sued until then, but it may be said that
there are already enough applications in,
to bring the enrollment for next year up
to the average enrollment at Davidson.

Twenty-five Fresh
Debaters Try Out

On Tuesday night, April 12th, the try-
the debating team
were held in Shearer Hall. Twenty-five
men, representing the oratorical ability
of the first year class, contested for the
honor of representing Davidson in the
annual debate with Carolina. The pre-
siding officer for the occasion was Henry
Powell, and the three judges who made
the sefections were Jim Appleby, Jim Mc-
Alpine, and W. K. Pritchett.

Each speaker was limited to eight min-
utes, and was given the privilege of dis-
cussing any phase of the question de-
sired. The contestants spoke one after
another before the same judges, and the
tryouts lasted almost four hours. Ac-
liams, of Linden, N. C., with C. R. Prit-
chett, of Reidsville, N. C., as an alternate.
The negative is composed of Murray
Christian, of Mobile, Ala., and Alex.
Edelman, of Goldsboro, N. C., with W. J.
Beavers, of Atlanta, Ga., as an alternate.

The debate with Carolina is scheduled
for May 2nd, but as the teams repre-
senting the University will not be select-
ed until April 28th and due to spring holi-
days, the date will probably be postponed.
The affirmative will debate on home
soil, while the negative makes a trip to
Carolina. Both teams are hard at work
just now, and are hopeful of adding fur-
ther victories to the freshman debating
record. ;
