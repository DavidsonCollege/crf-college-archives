‘ - Davidson’s women’s basket-
ball season, its first in five years,
began tentatively November 12
with a scrimmage at Belmont
Abbey. With fall sports seasons
barely over and just a few days of
practice under their belt, the Wild-
cats entered that scciainiage with

'Cats Rebound With Three in a Row:
Streak Snapped With Win Over UNCA

By Bruce Balestier

Entering their game Monday
night against UNC-Asheville, the
Davidson basketball team knew
that, if they were going to make
any sort of move up in the Big
South standings, it would have to
start with a win over the Bulldogs.
It. wasn’t a masterpiece, but the

"| Wildcats did get an 76-68 win,
-| powered mainly by 29-38 shoot-
| ing at the free throw line and 22

"| points from Detlef Musch. The win
halted a seven-game losing streak.

In each half, Davidson threat-
ened to put the Bulldogs out of

_| their misery, but could not finish
| the job. Two baskets in the lane by

It’s no secret to anyone that as
Detlef Musch goes, so go the
Davidson Wildcats. Wednesday
night, Musch was too sexy for
Charleston Southern; his efficient
20-point performance led the ‘Cats

~~ 1 to a 77-65 win, their second con-
_, | secutive Big South victory. For the

second year in a row, Davidson
seems to be attempting to salvage
a disappointing season with a late-
season surge to the conference
tournament.

Musch fought through double-
teams to hit 8-12 shots from the
floor, and hit 4-4 from the free
throw line; each foul shot came at
the tail end of a three-point play. It

| was arguably the most effective

Using aggressive defense and
anear-perfect second half by Detlef
Musch as catalysts, Davidson ex-
tended their well-timed winning

night, with a 59-52 triumph over

_| Winthrop in Rock Hill, S.C. The

victory raised the Wildcats’ record
to 10-16, 5-8 in the Big South.
As has traditionally been the
case against Winthrop, the game
was much closer than it ought to
have been. Davidson held a 19-18
lead after an ugly and utterly for-
gettable first half in which both

streak to three games Saturday

gave the ‘Cats a 36-29 lead with
:46 left in the first half, before they
let UNCA back in it. As Mario
Joyner scored for the Bulldogs with
:28 to go, Sterling Freeman was
called fora foul off the ball. Robert
Watson made only the first free
throw, but Mike Alexander re-
bounded the miss and laid it in;
Davidson held justa 36-34 halftime
lead.

Early in the second half, the
Wildcats pulled away to a nine-
point lead before running out of
steam. Musch, taking the ball
constantly at two defenders, made
five of six foul shots in the first
four minutes of the half to push the
Davidson lead to 45-36. But the
surge stopped there, as UNCA

Musch has been this season.
Early on, it looked as if Musch
would be the one having his butt
kicked. Smaller and faster Bernard
Nelson of Charleston Southern
took Musch outside on the first
two Buccaneer possessions and hit
short jumpers, then finished a fast
break with a dunk as the Bucs took
a 6-2 lead. The lead reached 13-6
with 15 minutes to play before
Davidson responded. Musch’s 10
points inside in the half opened up
the three-point arc; Jason Zimmer-
man and Janko Narat each hit a
pair of threes in the half. The Wild-
cats led. 39-33 at the intermission.
The Bucs made the first basket
of the second half to get within
four points (39-35), but once the

teams shot under 30% from the
field. Musch missed all five of his
shots, picked up three fouls and did
not score in the half.
But Musch owned the low
block after halftime; he made all
six of his field goals and four of six
free throws to score 16 points.
Musch’s effective play led the
Wildcats to 58% shooting in the
second half, but still they could not
gain much breathing room. In fact,
Winthrop trailed by just one point
(41-40) with 5:31 left before
Davidson pulled tentatively away.
Musch’s layup off a lob pass by
J.D. Heuer made it 47-42 with 2:21

Team Takes Third at.
Southern Conference Meet

By Peter Hurtado '

The men’s track and field team °

picked afine time to turn the inten-
sity up a few notches, posting
several outstanding times and
scoring seven points at the South-
em Conference Indoor Champion-
ships atETSU this weekend. Head
Coach Gary Andrew maintained
“this was the best indoor perform-

') ance by a Davidson squad since

I’ve been coaching here.”

Sophomore Duncan Spears
continued his domination in the
400m, blazing to a 51.26 to place
7th overall. Duncan broke his own
school record set only a week ago
with his performance.

Senior Ted Richardson also
placed 7th in the 3000m run witha

scored four in a row to cut it to 45-
40. Again at the 12:18 mark, when
Spain scored on a set inbounds
play to make it 51-42, the “Cats
seemed ready to put the game out
of reach, but again the Dogs cut it
to five. Finally, with 6:37 left,
Musch’s turnaround jumper got
the lead into double-digits (63-52),
and despite some careless turn-
overs that might have been a factor
against a better team Davidson
captured the win.

The Wildcats’ half-long pa-
rade to the line and improved de-
fense made the difference. Thanks
to 18 second-half fouls by UNCA,
Davidson shot 29 foul shots in the
period, making 21. Their defense
limited the Bulldogs to 33% shoot-

Wildcats responded, the game was
over. Narat hit a three-pointer and
Zimmerman stole the ball and took
it in for a layup to force a Char-
leston Southern timeout. After the
timeout, Narat hit another three-
pointer and Musch converted a
three-point play for a 50-37 edge.
The Buccaneers could come only
as close as seven points thereafter.
The defense of J.D. Heuer, with
help from Musch and Narat, held
Nelson scoreless after a 15-point
first half.

.Davidson’s large lead late in
the game madeit possible forcoach
Bob McKillop to insert all three
walk-ons for the first time all year.
Freshman Linton Elliott (1-4 ft)
and senior Matt (Chilly-Mo)

left, and Janko Narat’s two foul
shots made it 50-44 with 1:47 to
go. Winthrop cut it to 51-49 with
1:18 left, but Narat made five of
six free throws after that to secure
the victory.

Stingy defense was a constant
for the ‘Cats in the win; Winthrop
shot just 32.7% for the game.
Specifically, Davidson coach Bob
McKillop singled out his team’s
defense on Eagle center Mark
Hailey asakey. Hailey, whoscored
24 points in Winthrop’s one-point
win over Davidson in January, was
held to4 points on 0-8 shooting by
Wildcat defenders J.D. Heuer,

ing from the field in the half.

Musch operated effectively in
the pivot, despite the consistent
double-team, hitting 7-12 field
goals,'8-11 free throws and grab-
bing 8rebounds. Point guard Frank
Harris led the ‘Cats t® a 42-35
cushion on the boards with 10 re-
bounds, and also scored 16 points.
J.D. Heuer (11 points) saw the
balance of the minutes at the 4 spot
for the second game in a row; the
additon of another perimeter threat -
to the lineup takes some defensive
pressure from Musch. Zimmerman _
scored 10 and handed out 7 assists.
The win lifted the ‘Cats to 8-16, 3-
8 in Big South play.

Matheny entered the game with
1:19 left, and freshman Tim
Caldwell joined them with 30 sec-
onds to play.

McKillop was, of course,
pleased to have a rare easy win,
and saw offensive balance as the
key.“For the first time tonight,” he
said, “we got an inside-outside
game, and it was pretty balanced.”
Narat broke out of a slump to lead
the outside attack with 19 points,
including 4-5 three-point shoot-
ing. Point guard Frank Harris added
17, and his eight boards led the
team for the second successive
game. —

Point guard Frank Harris
turned in one of his best games of
the season, hitiing seven. of eight
shots and scoring 16 points to tie
Musch for team-high. Narat added
10 on 8-10 shooting from the foul
line.

Davidson will conclude its
