Area Exams, 1967-1969

In Memoriam

“Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind
to: suffer
The slings’ and arrows of out-
rageous fortune,
Or to take arms against
of troubles,
And by opposing end them.”

a sea

The faculty has made a wise and
timely decision on area exams. By
cutting through the red tape and
false issues Which have clouded this
question from the start, the faculty
has exercised much-neetled authority
to resolve an agonizing problem.

One immediate ayd desirable ef-
fect of the faculty's decision will be
to reduce the mounting emotional
tension of sophomores who are faced

‘with the option of transferring or

“sticking it out’’ with the exams. At
thiss late date, less than half of the
sophomore class had passed more than
one of the four exams. Decisive fac-
ulty action, after so many delays, will
relieve the confusion which has inter-
rupted plans for studying for the ex-
ams.

Of course, the real issue behind
the area exam question is the course-
requirements approach to liberal arts
education. The special committee will
be able to attack this problem more
effectively since it can now do so
without being restricted by a commit-
ment to area exams.

One can only speculate about. the
forces which produced such hasty and
decisive action on a subject which
has been bandied around for so long.
Desperation could have played a part.
The faculty was faced with a brace
of alternatives to the area exams as

strong support—by faculty or stu-
derits—for any specific proposal

tndoubtably, the faculty was faced
with the consequences of having
bungled into a commitment-to the

were not adequately prepared.

Indications are that the faculty was
impressed. by the restraint and re
ponsibility of the students who.of-
fered verious. proposals on area ex-
Yims. While certain faculty members
were sensitive to the psychological
ension and .confusion of students
yver the exams, it is doubiful that
threats of mass transfer were taken
seriously. 8

Students acted to their own advan-
tage when they allowed restraint to
rule when the delicate deliberations
in the EPC could have been disturbed
by threats or outbursts of direct ac-
tion. All along the way, the faculty’s
favor fell on those who expressed their
concern responsibly. :

We hope that’ students will resist
the temptation to view the faculty
action as capitulation after a fight.
Such an attitude might prejudice the
impending study of course require-
ments.

The view that the faculty is either
right about everything or completely
useless is not a desirable stance for
the reformers to take, since their
reforms must be enacted by the facul-
t

y.

“The moral credibility of the faculty
has beer: enhanced by this forthright
admission of error and resolve to be-
gin anew.

The Fruits Of Victory

With everyone running around Da-
vidson making prophecies about sub
sidized football, and with the Char-
lotte papers. predicting the fall of the
short-lived Davidson dynasty in the
Southern Conference, it is at least
nice to know that there is one group
on campus Which has not been ham
pered by the ominous whisperings.

That groupy of course, is the foot-
ball. team.

Whetlier the idea of subsidized ath-
letics is right or wrong, whether the
school will have to de-emphasize foot-
ball. and whether it is financially un-
profitable to play football at David-
son are questions which certainly have
been on everyone's minds.

For two quarters last weekend it
appeared ot be on the team’s min

more than defense was. But the ef- -/

fort in the second half overcame -all
doubt, and in the end “there was at
least -partial sweetness to overcome
the sour taste of Saturday's news pa-
oers. ’

It appears now that football is on
the wane at Davidson, despite the 100
per cent efforts of everyone on the
team.

It is quite likely extremely

On Spencership

There have been some grumblings
all week from students and faculty
about freedom of the student press,
everyone saying something and very
few listening to others

For the sake of clarification, it is
necessary that the incidents of the
past week be explained. We hope
that such explanation will add an ele-
ment of fact to the prevalent rumors

and cool down an over-heated misun-”

derstanding.

Last week’s DAVIDSONIAN was
rather poorly handled by all parties
concerned. j

In its efforts to get the commission
reports to the alumni, the adminis-
tration assumed a power seldom grant-
ed, that of reading the paper’s copy.
In doing so, it granted a prorfiise to
the paper that last week’s issue would

be distributed to some 16,000 alumni °

along with the paper’s regular sub-
scribers.

It turned out to be a promise which
the administration found difficult to
keep, because of its! displeasure with

_the presence of an editorial

The president’s office has! said that
it was_unaware of the terms of agree-
ment. For this failure in the adminis-
trative ranks to communicate, and
for its exertion of power over the
paper, the administration is at fault.

However, the editors assume re-

probable .. . that Homer Smith is in
his last season at Davidson.

And sad as it may seem, the best
season in Davidson’s football history
will in all probability mark the ironic
decline of Wildcat dominance.

We have laughed at the people we
jokingly called “the jocks.” We have
ignored them in the past, for they
won small and they lost big. We
have read our yearbooks, in which
we saw less space each year for foot-
ball and more for basketball.

Now the tide is turned, but per
haps not for long. If reports find more
credence than criticism, we will return*

* to the years of the Dirty Thirty and

more laughter.

There will be a few memories, an
extra page or two in the annual, and
at least a tangerine or two as the
fruit of the team’s labor.

But there will be no return to the
big year, when Davidson won big.

What is left is the present (and
perhaps a hope for the future). If we
win big again tomorrow, and come
close next week, who knows. what
the future will hold.

So right now, let’s live for the pre-

tion could have chosen either to pur-
chase the abridgments and send them
to alumni or draft their own abridg-
ments. :

.Had we done this, the Charlotte
papers would not have taken our
abridgments and utilized them as they
did, without specific mention of their
advisory nature and with a pervading
sense of finality.

«Had we done this, there would have
been no agreement, to be followed by
broken agreement and hard feelings;
there would have been no implied ob-
ligation to mail the paper to alumni.

The ire question, therefore, of
who is lame comes down to the
simple answer of everyone involved.

The solution of the problem brings
an element of, promise to the situa-
tion.

From all indications, President Sam-
uel Spencer knew nothing of the
terms of the agreement; for this both
he and the editor. blame themselves.

His decision on Monday to distri-
bute the paper to clumni in spite of
his personal preference for reports
sans comment is a praiseworthy de-
cision, not because we feel the paper
deserves to be sent out, but because
the president has expressed through

is action a great willingness to co-
operate with the students. :

He has shown himself to be con-
cerned with their feelings and their
interests, and he has done it by mo-
mentarily disregarding his own in-,
terests.

It is not a major decision. But it
is significant, at least to us.

To the Editor:

that the students

saying

and-was rather interested in-

his reaction to my -letter
(DAVIDSONIAN, Oct. 24)
and the subsequent story (on
the charge that advanced
ROTC students had been ap-
proached by the ROTC de-
partment for their participa-
tion in the Moratorium).

Mr. Hart seems to have
forgotten. certain questions,
however, which certainly
are pertinent. For, example:

1. Why didn't the ROTC
department inform all of the
Advanced ROTC cadets that
this activity was not allow-
able under active . duty?
Surely everyone in the de-
partment should have been
told, if the good of the ROTC
students was a primary con-
sideration.

2. If intentions were altru-
istic, then why were the
names of Advanced ROTC
cadets taken secretly? (as
certainly seems to be indi-
cated by the available evi-
dence) This looks a bit sus-
picious.

3. Why were the students
who participated in the Mor-
atorium called-in one at a
time? This would seem to
be a bit intimidating to the
student, and one might draw
‘certain unspoken conclusions
from this rather prejudicial
to furthe. participation in
such activities in the future.

I admit my mistake in

but I do feel that ome might
read such an unspoken im-
plication’ of this sort by the
way the‘ situation was hand-
led. a

4. On the assumption that
more than three names were
taken, one may legitimately
question what is to be done
with the names if all of
these students do not have
the matter discussed with
them.

5. Does this participation
in the Moratorium affect the
security clearance of the
Advanced Student for com-
missioning?

6. Would Mr. Hart prefer
to let the rumor fester, or
have it cleared up in public?

As I stated in my letter,
I think the ROTC ‘depart-
ment has value on this cam-
pus, and one of my reasons
for articulating the rumor
was to settle the matter once
and for all, for the good of
the campus and the ROTC
department. ©

Personally, I think Col.
Foster had good intentions
for what he did. But I also
think that the best that can
be said about the situation
was that it was handled in
the worst way possible.

Mr. Hart must admit, how-
ever, that, the matter needs
to be cleared up now.

these coaches would prefer
any subsidization of their
teams to take such forms as

providing top quality physi- ,

As far as the baseball pro-

simply not true.

cer’s Commission ‘on Ath-

Games Commissions Play

“The, trouble with many professors at this in-
stitution.” remarked a senior professor at a little-
known Southern college, “is that they don’t have good
olfactory nerves—they don't tell a student when his
work stinks!”

I here recommend that not just professors, but
students and alumni alike, have inadequate olfactory
obes if they don’t detect a most’ unpleasant stench
when reading the report of the Commission on Inter-
‘ollegiate Athletics:

Equally odious was the outsized play given the
‘eport in last Saturday’s Charlotte Observer but
hat’s. another story.

Whether one agrees with the commission’s recom-
uendations or not, the report's’ sloppy thinking, non
sequitors and errors in just reporting the facis (see
letter on this page) insult the intelligence of even the
least critical reader.

Since the report is so obviously inadequate for
planning for the future of intercollegiate’ athletics at
Davidson, I have devised a series of games that can
provide hours of entertainment for game lovers every-
where.

THE NUMBERS GAME

Dust off your DAVIDSONIAN from last week,
ick out a statement from the Report, and. try to
support it with the reported results from the question-
naire. Here’s a starter: Report reads, “There is much
ess support for subsidization of our football team . . .”
By my calculations, using percentages from the com
nission’s questionnaire summary, I find that favoring
3ubsidized football in some form were students (71-
2%), faculty (28.8%), ahd alumni (71:1 ). Now if the
questionnaire sampling is accurate, this means that
we have about 720 students, 28 faculty members, and
11,200 alumni who supported subsidized football in
some form! I dare say the Report rather sidesteps
its own figures by noting that subsidized football has
“much less support” than subsidized basketball. =a

THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP GAME

We play this one with the acaden.ic game —
which may or may not give you an advantage in this
game. The idea here is to pick out a stated supposed
causal relationship in the report.and try to support
it. I return to the sentence used in the first game for
my example: “There is much less support for subsi-
diation of our football team, since in spite of a much
larger dollar and man-power budget than basketball,
this program has not been able to field winning teams.””
But where on.the questionnaire did the reasons for
preferences appear? Nowhere. So where did the com-
mission get this causation? That’s the game.

THE MORAL VICTORIES GAME

Take this quote from the Report: “Moral victor-
ies or ‘how you play the game’ are not enough.” Then
try to talk one-of your rugby-player friends into get-
ting off the rugby team. Try to convince the team
nembers of some of our longtime non-winning non-
subsidized teams (That’s right Commissioner, non-
subsidized teams lose too.) that the teams they play
on should be discontinued. Good luck.

THE MISREPRESENTATION GAME
Read Coach Tom Stevens letter on this page.
rhen try to pick out other passages in the Report that
nay not accurately reflect views expressed fo the
“ommission.

THE MONEY GAME

Read all the pasSages about expenses, then try
to think of all the factors the Commission may have
overlooked. Those only casually acquainted with the
principles of cost-benefit analysis will consider the
presentation of costs and benefits irregular at best.

It appears that if the Commission was going to
recommend, for instance, what it has recommended
for football, it should have felt compelled to produce
a detailed cost-benefit study of the present program
to be compared with a similarly detailed study of what
they recommend and foresee. The information sought
in such studies is neither easy to get nor easy to as-
semble, but it’s essential.

It's quite a game. Is it possible that the members
of the Commission are part of a worldwide conspiracy
— directed by Mattel? We'll never know. But it’s
reassuring to know that people in hig: }lr-es at Da-
vidson College could never fail to nove’ saca osvious
shortcomings in a study thattwould otherwise be given
some part in planning the future of the College.

Reader Attacks Klonsky;
Criticizes SDS Slogans

To the Editor:

I attended the speeches
delivered by Michael Klon-
sky and other SDS members
the other day in the Union,
and to be frank, I was im-
mensely disappointed.

Agreed I was biased. But
I did expect an outstanding
speaker to say the least.
Quite the contrary. The pre-
sentation bore no semblance
of order, direction, construc-
tiveness, .or anything else
that would redeem the two
hours we sat and listened.

Klonsky had one and only
one technique: the Slogan,

And I contend further from
this display that SDS is even
more narrow and_ bigoted
than the KKK..or JBS.

I refer you to Klonsky's

it would make, ‘Tousy pinko”
or “‘stupid nigger’’ seem ra-

IT went to the presentation
to learn one thing: what does
SDS plan to do after they
destroy our ‘sick society?"
This question was asked no
less than three times and
twice he avoided the answer

as he did to all other ques-
tions.

Finally Klonsky yielded.
