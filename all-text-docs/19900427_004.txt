Convocation: At Least
the Alumni Were There

It is not surprising that less than one hundred seniors at-
tended their own Convocation this past Friday. Fortunately, the
alumni visiting this past weekend filled the seats of those opting for
the beach. The decision made by those students who abandoned
Spring Convocation for their coastal pilgrimage was both sad and
embarrassing. In fact, Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke, the featured speaker
at Spring Convocation, mentioned at the outset of this speech that he
understood many “students had a date with the beach.”

Students should perhaps realize that a liberal arts education
involves liberating values and ideals. No where could one have
enhanced his or her knowledge more than by listening to Mayor
Schmoke’s brief and entertaining speech on the drug problem.
Schmoke is labelled by many in the press as having a radical
viewpoint in his policy toward drugs because he doesn’t believe in
prosecuting abusers and criminals, but rather treating them through
medicine, even if this means using illegal substances. Nonetheless,
those students who decided to drive to the beach that day were
never exposed to Mayor Schmoke’s strong argument against the
Bush admihistration’s drug policy.

President Kuykendall and the administration should be
applauded for bringing a Convocation speaker who inspires think-
ing and debate on an important national issue. Stated Mayor
Schmoke at the close of his speech, “only in market places of thinking
such as Davidson College can we challenge the status-quo.” _How-
ever, if many students prioritize Beach Weekend over Spring
Convocation is Davidson a “market place of thinking” or an institu-
tion for better tans?

Recycling: Harvard vs. Davidson

To the Editor:

Sadly, my wife was
unable to attend Davidson
College because at the time
itwasanall-maleinstitution.
She settled for second best
and went to Harvard Uni-
versity. Naturally thesedays —
we receive mailings from
bothinstitutions. And lately,
I confess, Harvard seems to
be the one with loftier vi-
sion.

You see Harvard be-
lieves (and sostates) thatitis
a leader. It believes it must
lead by example - not only
words. So Harvard has ac-
tively, aggressively, effec-
tively addressed the solid
waste problem we did face.
Harvard has a major recy-
cling effort going on cam-
pus, smack in the middle of
Harvard Yard. And not only
aluminum cans, glass, paper,
newspapers - even yard

waste. But Harvard knows
thatthe problem has another
side: the generation of the
waste. Thus, Harvard buys
recycled paper in its offices
and is banning styrofoam.
Harvard is working for a
solution by example in Bos-
ton. Harvard even featured
an extensive story on the
stages they were taking ina
recent magazine. Princeton
and other type schools are
taking similar steps.

Now, what about
Davidson? Exactly, the op-
posite I fear. My class has a
cluster reunion, April 20-22.
April 22 is the huge twenti-
ethanniversary of Earth Day.
Alasandalack, the college is
more eager to offer Bloody
Marysata reception thando
something meaningful that
day with its alumni. Shame.

Then there’s the con-
sumption of the college.
Again, the record indites the

school. In today’s mail came
a questionnaire that was
printed on 8 1/2 x 14 inch
paper. The back side was
empty. Why not 8 1/2 x 2
inch paper printed on both
sides? The financial savings
would exceed my donation
I'm sure (and yes, I do give.
.. for now), And why not be
an outspoken leader? Sell
recycled paper. in the store.
Use recycled paper in the
administration. Stop using
chemical intensive grounds
keeping - switch to low
impact or even organic.

In short get on the stick.
Be a leader. Have some vi-
sion. It’s time to help make
solutions rather than be part
of the problem. That’s the
kind of Davidson thought!

Davidson is Recycling -

To the Editor:

lam happy toannounce
a major breakthrough re-
garding recycling and the
college stationery order. All
college stationery is coordi-
nated and ordered through
our office. The total num-
bers ordered each year are
staggering. Last year they
were approximately the fol-
lowing: 312,000 regular let-
terheads and second sheets;
210,00 regular envelopes;
and 36,00 monarch size en-
velopes. That's a lot of pa-

In the past when I have
investigated recycled papers
forour stationery, costs have

been higher (for papers of
comparable quality) than
what .we. were currently
paying. But market condi-
tions are apparently turning,
due to increased demand
fromconsumers for recycled
papers. More companies
thanever beforeare starting
to manufacture recycled
papers, and_as volume is
going up prices are coming
down. The company that
manufactures our current
paper -- Strathmore -- has
just introduced a recycled
paper than matches our cur-
rent paper in quality, tex-
_ture, color, and best of all,
price.
Therefore, | am making

the switch torecycled paper
for the college stationery
order this summer. The
paper will look virtually the
same to campus users, with
the minor exception that the
watermark on paper willsay
“recycled.” Eventhatisa nice
bonus because people will
know the Davidson is using
recycled paper -- that’s an
important message to con-
vey. But even more impor-
tant, this is an important
commitment for the college
to make.

Trees Were A Danger to Players

| To the Editor: | ;

I would like to respond
to your editorial Tearing
Down Trees for Tennis in the
April 12 issue of the
Davidsonian. I am actually
grateful that the question
wasraisedand consider your
concern valid.

At the outset, let me say
that the action was taken re-
luctantly by the grounds
crew at my request. My re-
quest wasalso painfully con-
sidered, and assure you not
made lightly. I have been a
member of the National
Arbor Foundation for more
than four years, which in-
volves notonly yearly finan-
cial contributions, but also
yearly tree plantings. lown
two pieces of property, one
local and one in the moun-
tains, and maintain thou-
sands of trees on both. I
consider myself a militant
environmentalist, and totally
unsympathetic with con-
cerns of industry in environ-

mental matters.
Thetrees which werecut
down were planted at the
request of myself and Thom
Cartmill, then athletic direc-
tor, in 1975, to act asa buffer
between the cars and the
lower tennis courts. We
made a mistake in that we
underestimated the speed of
their growth, and the result-
ing patter of light and
shadow thatwould occuron
ournow varsity’s men’s and
women’s tennis complex.
Put simply, this pattern
of light and shadow pres-
ents a safety problem. If you
consider any tennis stadium
you have ever seen on tele-
vision orin person, youmay
recollect that there arenever
trees around for the same
reason that there are never
trees around a baseball dia-
mond. Consider the fact a
fastball in baseball comes at
the batter from 60 feet away
at90+milesanhour. A serve
incollege tennis can comeat
the player from 78 feet away

at130+miles perhour. Ifthe

ball travels through the
doppled effect of light and
shadow from trees, the re-
sult can be not only embar-
rassing, butalso dangerous.
The problem is that the ball
appears light, thendark, then
light in repeating pattern,
making. depth. perception
almost impossible. This is
why we had to take down
the trees.

Wewill planta hedge to
act as a buffer between the
parking lot and the courts.
The grounds crew will select
the hedge that they prefer.
As penance, I pledge to con-
tinue to plant at least ten
different variety of trees each
year as I have for the past
three years. But once again
let me state that your ques-
tion was valid, and the con-
cern justified, and I appreci-
ate the opportunity to ex- -
plain.
