Moral Issues at Meeting

Christian Endeavor Society
Holds Interesting Dis-
cussion Sunday

FAVOR CLEAN DANCING

Majority Believe Sunday
Sports Unnecessary

A majority of the members pres-
ent at a mecting of the Christian
Endeavor Society Sunday night
agreed that dancing was not wrong
in itself, but that the evils are due
to the surroundings of most dances.
When people of low morals assem-
ble to dance, using liquor, it was
agreed, the Christian would have no
business in going. One member,
however, maintained that dancing
is an evil in itself,

The majority agreed that Sunday
golf, tennis and other sports would
be entirely unnecessary on the Dav-
idson campus (other places? were
not discussed). It was felt that per-
mission to exercise on Sunday Was
not needed because of the large
amount of time left unrestricted by
the college. A minority maintained
that students would be more likely
to remain on the campus on Sun-
days if they were allowed something
to do, but it was felt that the real
reason for the exodus of students
is the lack of girls on the campus.
It was felt in general, that Sunday
should be kept a different day as
it is on the Davidson campus.

Right and Wrong

These practical applications grew
out of a discussion of criteria for
determining right from wrong. It
was generally agreed that the hard-
est decisions come in little things
in which there is no clear division
between right and wrong. One
statement which was made in a
variety of ways was that a thing
must be considered wrong if it runs
counter to the beliefs of someone
whose character might be affected
adversely by seeing it practiced.
The group agreed, however, that a
Christian would not be bound to re-
frain from some reasonable activity
like attending a ball game just be-
cause one person disapproved his
going on the grounds that he was
attending a place where gambling
occurred. :

The idea that a Christian con-
science should be built up was
brought out in contrast to the idea
of following an established principle
at all times. Some of the other
suggestions were: “Don’t ever per-
mit the good to gain mastery over
the best.” “Don’t ask whether an
act is displeasing to God; ask
whether it is pleasing to Him.”
“Could Jesus go along?” A last suff-
gestion was the definition of sin
used by Dr. Gwynn: “Sin is any-
thing which goes against an inform-
ed conscience.”

She Charges Cruelty

Books and the moods they create
are divorcing Jack C. yon Bloeker,
U. of California student, from his
wife. Alleging that her husband
spent all his time studying, Mrs. von
Bloeker has filed suit for divorce.

She charged cruelty. The com-
plaint asserted that since their mar-
riage in 1934, von Bloeker has sel-
dom removed his eyes from his
texts and has developed an irrit-
able temper.

An independent

n independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who
said they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated

they personally prefer a light smoke.

Miss Keeler verifies the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain
harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process

Exercise can keep the muscles in
