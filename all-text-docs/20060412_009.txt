Outdoor housing opportunities to be provided for enthusiastic students

While 32 students will live in the new
Main Street town houses next year, 47 more
students have opted for another new hous-
ing option. RLO approved the movement to
allow outdoor hous-
ing as a trial option
next year.

The creative new
approach will allow
the 28 men and 19
women to move
throughout campus
for their residence.

Dean of Residence
Life Gary Wilhelm
gave his full support
to the outdoor hous-
ing program, saying
that he thinks it is a
great response to an
increasing student
demand.

“A large number of
students have been
sleeping outside
unofficially already
this semester. After
we saw that they were
desirous of having
the outdoor option, we knew the best thing
to do was to have an official option next
year,” said Wilhelm. “Therefore, we are
proud to announce the opening of Belk
Outdoor Hall.”

To celebrate the approval, the 47 students
and approximately 32 of their supporters
slept out on Belk Lawn last Tuesday night.

“We're glad to see this kind of support for
our housing option. So many of us feel con-
strained by the walls and the ceilings of con-
ventional rooms. We just want to be liberat-

ed from those restraints,” said John Quincy
08,

for outdoor housing. He spent Tuesday

night on the ground wearing only a heavy
jacket and a pair of long underwear.

“We are all very excited for next year. I’ve
started planning hall programs for Belk
Outdoor, or B.O., as we’re calling it,” said
Quincy.

“Our freshman hall wanted to stick
together again next year,” said 1st Belk resi-
dent Aaron Wells ’09. “We knew we couldn’t
all get into the sophomore apartments with
our varying lottery numbers, though.

Students to get credit for protesting

In response to a growing movement from
both students and faculty, Registrar Julie
Hawthorne announced last Friday that next
semester, the college will allow class credit
for participating in student protests.

“Protesting for or against certain causes is
an important aspect of the college experi-
ence,” said Hawthorne. “We felt that it fit
the requirements for credit towards a liberal
arts degree.”

“It will be really hard
to think up clever
protest signs without
plagiarizing them from
other protest signs.”

Initially, it administrators discussed
counting participation in protests towards
community service hours, but that was
decided against.

Many members of the college community
are in favor of the new credit option.

“Providing credit will promote participa-
tion from a wider percentage of the student
body,” said Will Young ’08. “More students
will now be willing to support worthy causes
and really make a difference in our commu-
nity.”

Professor of Political
Science James North sup-
ports the decision.

“Political advocacy is an
important part of being a .
college student,” said
North. “I’m glad our
administration is finally
supporting the students’
right to make signs and 7
complain about things that ©
don’t directly affect them.”

Others are concerned
that protesting isn’t really }
an academic pursuit

“With our Honor Code,
it will be really hard to
think up clever protest
signs without plagiarizing

them from other signs,” said Laura Keller
09.

The addition of credit will also make par-
ticipation in protests much more time effec-
tive for students.

“One reason we didn’t have many stu-
dents turn out for the ‘March of Discontent’
a few weeks ago was because a lot of them
said they ‘just had too much work to do,”
said Fran O’Neil ’07. “Now that students can
get credit for protesting, I think we'll have a
great turnout for our ‘Angry August’ and
‘Seditious September’ protests.”

Credit for protesting could be counted ina
variety of different ways. The subject of a
protest will determine the course number
the students are given credit for.

For instance, if a student protests about
an international political scenario, then they
would receive a political science credit that
could also be counted towards their multi-
cultural requirement. Or if someone protest-
ed the RSC residency, credit would be given
in the theater department..

Not everyone was pleased by the decision,

however.

“Attending a rally is not a form of educa-
tion,” said Ryan Lee ’06. “Studying dead
languages or drawing naked people is what
education is all about. Trying to force your
views on others is the exact opposite.”

Protests would have to be focused upon
external causes in order to count for credit.
Protests concerning RLO, the Union Café, or
the humor publications would not receive
credit.

Next semester, students will receive. credit for standing around

together again next year. I’m so pumped.”

The new housing is not without its critics,
however.

“How are they going to enforce alcohol
policy on the out-
door hall?” said
Mandy Heath ’06.
“What about
when _ students
from indoor halls
come back up the
hill and just pass
out on the out-
door halls? Hall

cleanups are
another. matter
entirely. This

move raises far
too many ques-
tions that the
administration
has not consid-
ered.”

“It is suprising-
ly hard to find pri-
vacy outdoors,”
said Amber Adler.
“This is a very
small school.”

Professors have many concerns about out-
door housing

“RLO has decided not to have hall coun-
selors on Belk Outdoor Hall,” said Professor
of Art Ralph Candon.. “Where are students
supposed to go when they get locked out?
Will they call RLO every time it happens?”

Wilhelm addressed other concerns in a
statement during the presentation of the
new housing program to the Trustees on
Friday.

“Internet connectivity and phone lines

will operate on the same principles as those
in indoor halls. For example, we will limit
our outdoor residents to one phone line per
room, just as we do with indoor residents,”
said Wilhelm.

Trustee Jacqueline Mulberry ’79, a mem-
ber of the Committee on Campus Religion
and Life, said she was impressed at the ini-
tiative taken by the outdoor residents.

“It’s great to see students pursuing their
goals and succeeding. I look forward to vis-
iting campus next year and seeing students
lying out on the ground everywhere as I take
an early morning jog,” said Mulberry.

“We will limit our
outdoor residents to
one phone line per
room, just like the
indoor residents.”

RLO is still working out details on which
amenities to provide students. Questions of
closet space and desks are being addressed
by a joint administration-student commit-
tee, which should announce its decisions by
the end of the semester.

“I’m really hoping that we can convince
RLO to provide us with sleeping bags; I
mean, it’s cheaper than a mattress and
frame setup, so I don’t see any reason not
to,” Quincy said. “But even if we wind up
having to provide our own, we're just grate-
ful to be sleeping outside.”

Dean of Students Office cited weeks left until graduation, the |
proximity of Easter Break, and a spike in homework-related activ-
