Davidson-Carolina fans saw an unusual sight at the game last week when a band of band leaders
paraded during the half. Thirty-one men, all bandleaders and each in his own individual uniform, com-
bined to form the Carolina music section. Three representatives from Davidson, J. C. Pfohl, Thane Mc-
Donald, and W. P. Babcock were present in this group.

Mr. McElway closed by saying,
“They (meaning those who follow
a Christian life) counted the cost
of life with Him as we must count
the futility of life without Him.”

Discuss Punishment

Continuing its series of infor-

Literary Society, at its meeting

last Tuesday evening, Octob
18, various

considered the
phases of Capital Punishment.

Many debatable points were
brought forth and the members
engaged in a warm discussion
during the entire meeting.
Among the arguments advanced
was the point the capital pun-
ishment is more humane than
life imprisonment. Many mem-
bers immediately disagreed with
this view and suggested that
capital punishment is not an ex-
pression of Christianity. Several
other opinions were expressed
and while the majority of views
were it to ital
