Refusing to let

for a while — with my writing,
that is — and it’s good to be back
in the flow. I’ ve just been so busy

Carrie Van Deest, my Homecom-
ing Queen, and I have been at every

parade for miles around waving from

the convertibles. We have also been
giving inspirational speeches in the
public schools to show that public school
products can actually get somewhere in
life. To see those kids’ eyes light up
when they see the Dalmatian-fur rim of
my crown warms my fuzzy.

I have had time to read the
Davidsonian, however, and Naresh
Nagella’s Op-Ed column entitled “I got
a good haircut, and it’s not because of
the way it looks” (Nov. 4) was espe-

cially interesting to me.

Nagella wrote about getting his
haircut at Raeford’s Barber Shop on
Main Street. He related his good feel-
ings about “how good a slower and
smaller life can be.” He spent two
hours in Raeford’s. He talked with all
types of people in a relaxed atmosphere,
laughing at those impatient ones who
chose to drive to Charlotte for their
haircut. According to Naresh, “The
result was pleasing.”

Nagella raves about the slow way
of life symbolized by Raeford’s shop
and then draws this conclusion: “I guess
it left me a little disappointed about the
future. As computers get faster, tech-
nology becomes more and more omni-
present, and everything becomes
quicker, ‘Raeford’s way of life’ will
probably disappear. But such is the
price we pay for progress which should
continue.”

He seems to regard the “slower
and smaller life” as something quaint
that unfortunately must die. What a
shame.

Icannot be as nonchalant about its
death. I cannot sacrifice it for “the

efficiencies and economy of the fu-
ture.” Are you satisfied with the way
things are going? Nagella’s experience
caused him “to rethink the apparent
‘illogic’ behind a |20-minute haircut.”
Should we not also rethink the apparent
“logic” behind our American lifestyle?

as if it were the only way.

Who do we think we are? We’re
exporting nuclear power technology to
China when we haven’t even figured
out how to deal with the waste it pro-
duces.

We teach others to work more
quickly and be more productive when

“Dll take my cue from President Vagt’s inauguration
address. I am going to be an idealist. P m going to change

the world. Who’s with me?”

Patrick Giantonio spoke on our cam-
pus. Giantonio walked through central
Africa from the east to west coast over
a period of four and a half years.

He now travels around the nation
teaching what he learned. Patrick ques-
tioned — as I do— our country’s influ-
ence on the rest of the world.

We export our lifestyle and preach
it as the ultimate good. We educate
others in our form of government, our
form of economy, and our form: of life

our own over-productivity causes stress
related diseases, diseases that kill.

Our use-once-and-throw-away
mentality produces more waste than
any other nation, and yet we will not
rest until there is a McDonald’s on
every corner of every street around the
world.

At Davidson, do our classes rein-
force this life or call it into question?

I am deeply concerned for our na-
tion, our world, and our campus. Our
consumerism, our materialism, and our
fast-paced life are killing us. Why are

~ we in such a hurry? Where are we

racing to — other than our deaths?

This week, along with me, stop a
moment, take a deep breath, and truly
think about the way you are living.

Unlike Nagella, I do not believe
“the price we pay for progress” should
be paid. I do not think that the gains will
outweigh the losses. Our progress is
often “regress.” Irefuse to let “Raeford’s
way of life” die.

I, too, was in Raeford’s the other
day for a “120-minute haircut.”” While
there, Demian Dellinger and I remarked
as well on the different mentality of the
barber shop. Instead of talking about its

_death, we talked about how we were

going to live our lives to make our
world more like Raeford’s.

I'll take my cue from President
Vagt’s inauguration address. I am go-
ing to be an idealist. I’m going to
change the world.

Who’s with me?

he newness of college has

finally worn off and in. its

place is an accelerator. Just

touch that pedal, and you

will send yourself hurtling toward a

wall. The wall is the passage of time,

and it sneaks up on you pretty quickly.

The ndivéte of being a freshman

has worn off. We know how to get our

mail and where to sit at football games.
We are now Davidson students.

We can no longer be considered

new in our classes as the first semester

begins its inexorable wind-down to-
ward Dec. 18 (with some aggressive
scheduling, some of you more adven-
turesome types will see it wind down
to the 16th).

“That’s the way we did it in high
school” no longer applies to anything
except whining.

Our college professors have
proven themselves the equals — and
often-the betters — of our high school
instructors.

Even I am being won over by Dr.
Bivens’ subtle tricks in Calculus, al-
though I’m not quite ready to let go of
all of my old methods.

This realization that we are really
where we are just hit me about a week
ago. I was taking a few minutes to see
where the next few weeks would be
taking me in the way of workload and
assignments.

I saw a series of four weeks com-
prised of work without respite. Merci-
less heaps of tests and papers, great
dumps of projects and presentations,
huge morasses of quizzes and labs.

With a few exceptions, the last
months have lulled us into a false
sense of security.

The abundant out-of-class time
of college, when compared with high
school, has led us to the false assump-
tion that we can goof around for a
while and still get everything done.
The next weeks will show us the error
of our ways.

That wail af reality’ is for us right
now a wall of work. On the other side
is blessed hindsight that will allow us

to see what we did well and poorly on
our various exams. On this side is that
cursed foresight called worry. I read a
quotation the other day that said
“Worry is just imagination misused.”
If that is true, I know of quite a few
people, including myself, who could
use a crash course in imagination.
Tragic fears and worries seem to be so
much more accessible to our minds
than justified fears or pleasant hopes
for the future.

The freshman wall is not reserved
just for that august body. There is a
form of it specific and special for each
of our four years in college and for
almost every other.year in our life.
The only exceptions to this are those
first years of our early lives when we
can’t wait for time to hurry up and let
us grow up. Having not experienced
any of the other “walls” of college, I
can only speculate about their appear-
ance or properties. Those of you read-
ing this probably know more of the
specific traits of all those walls better
than me. I'll let you fabricate your
own hopes and, unfortunately, your
own fears.

When I got through my senior
year of highschool last spring, [thought
that time would run much more slowly
after that. I saw college as a mono-
lithic slab of four years stretching to
infinity.

_ My memory must have been
pretty short because the four years
before high school had seemed ex-
actly the same.

Yet that time seemed to go by:at
breakneck speed. I can begin to see
the same disturbing trend here at col-
lege.

Time seems to go faster when
you are having fun. That being the
case, I need to start having a real
terrible time so that it will last longer.
The inverse relationship between
time’s passage and enjoyment level is
one of the most fascinating questions

‘Perhaps this article will goad
someone into research regarding it.
Physics majors, I’m talking to you.
They’re probably too busy speeding
toward their own late-semester wall to
do any research anyway.

Brace yourself for impact,
Davidson. Time marches ever for-
ward.

Swede defends Public Display of Affection

he opening of Mary Perrin
Anderson’s Op-Ed article in
the Nov. 11 issue of the
Davidsonian reads: “PDA.
We’ ve all seen it, been shocked by it,
and had nightmares as a result of it.”

PDA. I’ve seen it, rarely if ever
been shocked by it, and certainly not
had nightmares because of it.

Public Display of Affection should
be advocated, not castigated. Some-
how the term has emerged with a:nega-
tive connotation from deep within our-
selves and our Puritanical past.

Georgia Ringle has been telling
freshman halls for years
that she hopes to see more
overt acts of devotion be-

connections with traditions of the past.
In general, the United States is socially
freer than most nations. The tendency
towards an “anticulture” is increasing,
and social etiquette has diminished con-
siderably in prevalence. Americans are
generally inclined to judge less on ap-
pearance, whereas the social trend in
Europe is reversed.

Students at Davidson, forexample,
are generally not disturbed at seeing
others wearing shorts and soccer san-
dals in the middle of November.

Where in Europe douniversity stu-
dents run 400’s naked on a weekly
basis, walk around bearing only atowel,

Perhaps we should listen
to the “Sex Lady” instead .
of giggling to hide our own
sexual insecurities.

The reference to Europe in the
article is extremely inappropriate and I
was personally offended by it.

Evidently, Anderson has traveled
extensively through Europe and has wit-
nessed an infinite amount of seemingly

vulgar and tasteless PDA. European ©

society is viewed by Americans as more
decadent than that of the United States,
and more specifically, the Southeastern
states.

rationalizations? At Davidson during
PiKA’s Glamrock, women can dress
provocatively without being perceived
as promiscuous by their peers. If Maggie
Avery, however, chooses to unbutton
her shirt on a steamy night at another
Court party to reveal a sexy brassiere,
everyone stares. Is hypocrisy the pre-
vailing theme of social and gender rela-
tions at Davidson College?

Anderson admits (in regard to the

If you were merely taken aback,
would it have taken too much effort to
avert your eyes and focus your energies
on yourself and your friend?

A gesture of love which evokes
pleasure in the partakers should not be
ruined by a presumptuous stranger.

Where does one draw the line be-
tween which sort of PDA is admissible
and which is uncouth? There should be
no boundaries; those who indulge in
PDA should use their own discretion. |

fist and hanging out the window of ared

Yes, Anderson is correct.

This is not Europe, but unfortu-
nately she does not know how Europe
really is.
