“They use questions the way
a Cadillac uses gas.’ Who are
they? The 1980 Davidson Col-
lege Bowl team: John Boggess,
Julie Gibert, Bob Evans, team
captain Tim Newcomb, and
alternate Jim Crane.

Newcomb, {a Junior English
major from Asheville, North
Carolina) is the only returning
member of last year’s team. He
has improved since last year
and will give a formidable
performance again. Junior E-

Placement office exposes Charlotte medical scene to students

By KENT DYER

Is ther a particular job you
would like to look into over
Spring Vacation? Ken Wood, in
the Experiential Programs Of-
fice, helped Susan Casper and
me locate a three-day extern-

ship at the Miller Orthopedic —

Clinic in Charlotte over Christ-
mas Break. It was a. great way
for us to learn a little about the
practice of group medicine in a
short period of time.

Ken usually tries to place stu-
dents with Davidson alumni in
the student’s ‘specific field of
interest. I grew up in a small
town where the General Prac-
titioner treated everything from
runny noses to kidney disor-
ders, and I wanted to see what
it would be like to subspecialize
in a particular aspect of medi-
cine.

With this idea in mind, Ken
decided to contact Dr. Angus
McBryde, an Orthopedic Sur-
geon and Davidson Trustee, in
Charlotte. Within a week after
our conversation with Ken,
Susan and I received word from
McBryde that he looked for-
ward to seeing us over Christ-

mas.

Charlotte proved to be an
excellent place to study, both
because of its close proximity to
Davidson, and its large size
affords access to latest medical
technology.

McBryde expected a lot out
of us, a lot more than I had
originally expected myself. We
began rounds at~-7:30 each
morning and clung to his heels
until 5:00 in the evening.

In-the mornings McBryde
arranged for us to scrub with
him in the Operating Room of
Memorial Hospital. After sur-

gery we were whisked away in.

his blue van to Presbyterian
Hospital where we followed him
on patient rounds until lunch.
In the afternoon we donned lab
coats and sat in on office
examinations.

The main thing. that impres-
sed us was the fast pace at
which the group of nine subspe-
cialists atthe Miller Clinic was
able to‘ operate. At least three
physicians were on. call at the
Clinic during the day, and it
was not: unusual for each of
them to see fourty patients in
one afternoon.

Each member of the group
specialized in treating one parti-
cular aspect of Orthopedics. Dr.
McBryde dealt primarily with
athletic injuries and total hip
replacement, while another doc-

tor attended to hand problems.

An extern is assured of little

_ rest when there that many

doctors working together under
one. roof: Whenever Susan and I
stepped out for a few minutes to
catch our breath we would be
accosted and dragged off to see
another ‘set of X-rays:

Our medical education was
made. complete: by an X-ray
technician named Sam Williams
who took it upon’ himself. to
tutor us on the ‘‘unusual’’ cases
he had seen in his seventeen
years at Miller Clinic. When we
had seen our fill of backaches
Sam would suddenly appear

from the file room with a smile

on his face, and we knew that
we were in for a special treat.

_It’s amazing how a gory picture -
of a broken hip prosthesis inside’

a man’s pelvis can brighten
your day.

The secret to the success of
our particular externship was
working with people like Dr.

It's a shame more students

fessor Charles Lloyd, the team
coach, ‘‘I am especially glad to
have her on the team.”’ >

Senior Boggess from Bed-

point of a political science
major to the team. Alternate —
Jim Crane is a pre-med major
from Old Hickory; Tennessee.
There are no trivia buffs on this
team, says Lloyd. The members
are united by a common love for
learning.

Last week 24 players from the
33 intramural college bowl
teams were asked to try out for
this team. Detailed statistics on
such things as number of an-
swers right, number of at-
tempts, and speed at answering
were kept. The final decisions
were made Thursday with help
from these statistics. Lloyd was
aided in his deliberations by
German Professor Hansford
Epes, Physics. Professor Robert
Manning, English Professor
Randy Nelson, and former team
member James Gibert (brother
of Julie Gibert).

The team’s first match will be
at the Southern regional tourn-
ament February 14-16 at UNCC.
The Southern Region includes
Schools from Virginia, North
and South Carolina, Kentucky
and Tennessee. Lyman Collins,
Union College Bowl Coordina-
tor, says that the College Union
plans to organize rides to. this
tournament. Lloyd said that
there was a possibility that the
college would hold an invita-
tional,tournament the weekend -
before the regionals but these
plans are still vague. Lloyd
expects the UNC-CH teamtobe .

petition and the faculty ques-
