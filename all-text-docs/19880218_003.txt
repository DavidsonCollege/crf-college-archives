“T have a paper that was due two
weeks .ago, and a paper that was
due yesterday, and I’m getting the
lowest grade I’ve ever gotten in
any Class. And I have a paper due
for my Parables class, and a skit
for French. Oh, and I have a lot of
work to do, too. I have to work
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.”

“T've got a set of reviews to grade
and give back and two final exams
to make out; and they’ re both slide
exams, so that’s going to take me
a lot of time because I have yet to
make and develop the slides.”

finals to take. That’s pretty much .

“T have to write a paper, well, I’ve
got two papers, actually, one six
pages, long, and one three pages
long. They’re pretty much blow-
offs. I’ ve gota Spanish skit, which
is going to be a lot of fun, and then
a Spanish final which is no big
deal. Oh, yeah, I’ve got to read
“Bob the Carrot,’ too. Really, I’m
sort of cruising until Spring
break.”

Robert A. Brown, senior
political science major .

“Well, Ihave a paper in sociology,
I have a test in sociology, and I
have a great deal of American
philosophy reading, which I
haven’t done yet. Actually, an
entire book on philosophy that I
really have got to finish. And...
wow! I’m way behind!”
