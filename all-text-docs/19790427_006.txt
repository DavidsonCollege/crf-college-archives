Y students meet old folks

By LINDA HOOPES
Staff Writer

“It’s a shame," said sopho-
more Aurie Hall, “the attitude
our country has towards elderly
people. We hide them away and
don’t know what to do with
them, but they have so much to
offer us.”

Aurie, along with 8 other
Davidson students, has backed
up that opinion with action by
participating in the Y Student
Service Corps’ senior citizen
visitation program. The pro-
gram, which started this. year,
gives Davidson students the
opportunity to get to know local
senior citizens on a one-to-one
basis, and, reciprocally, gives
the senior citizens the chance to
become acquainted with a
young person—a welcome treat
for many of them who are
retired professors or schooltea-
chers and are used to being
around the ‘‘younger genera-
tion.”

The program is coordinated
by Brigid O'Connor, director of
the Depot, Davidson's senior
citizen center, and Ann Garner,
a Y executive Board member.
They pair each interested elder-
ly person with a willing student,
relying on word of mouth,
student interest, and a minimal
amount of publicity to attract
new people.

But once people are ‘‘in,”’
they generally stay there, for

one of the major emphases of
each student-senior citizen rela-

.tionship is its stability. Several

have been going on all
year, and most will continue
next year, including Aurie’s
weekly visit with her ‘‘adopted
grandmother,’’ Mrs. Helen
Abernethy.

Aurie tells of her first visit:
‘I was really nervous—not sure
what it would be like—and we
ended up sitting and talking for
three hours!”’ What do they talk
about in a typical visit? Any-
thing that comes to mind—
Mrs. Abernethy’s children, her
art (she did the directory cover
design), Aurie’s plans for a trip
to Ireland next year, and much
more. Because they are both
busy, visits are not regular, but
fit-in whenever possible. Mrs.
Abernethy sometimes fixes tea,
and Aurie hopes that they can
start going more places togeth-
er.

According to Aurie, her per-
spective on life has changed
quite a bit since the beginning
of her visits. ‘Whenever I get
nervous, I imagine myself look-
ing back from sixty-five years
of age, and I realize that it
won't matter then. It’s really
been helpful!’

Each relationship is unique—
some students take their ‘‘adop-
ted grandparent” shopping as
well as: helping with housework;
some, like Aurie and Mrs.
Abernethy, just sit and talk.
