he stumbles onto the floor,
“‘Turtle Tom McMillan”’.

Turtle returns for his final
year as head hotdog on this
year’s squad to replace near
legend Gerogie ‘‘Porgie’’ Kar]
who went to bigger and better
weinies in the pros (a moment
of silence please).

Turtle’s play was con-.

sistently doused with
mustard, ketchup and relish
this year, enough so that C.A.
felt his play resembled that of
the robot in the ill fated ‘‘Lost
in Space’’ TV show. (That

does not compute).

The only problem in Turtle’s
selection was his
classification. In tight

situations turtle has been

be in the meats or fruit sec-
tion. Ouch.

The other forward is sup-
posed to be a guard, but the
way he plays it doesn’t mat-

This year’s trigger man, the
man whose arm is frozen in
the cock position, is James
‘“‘Let 'em Fly’’ Williams.
Fly’s head is screwed on the
same way his pants are, back-

C.A. loved Monte’s style of
play. Mr. Midget would run in-
to, under, and over people, fall
down and go ‘““Waaaaa”’.

Referees such as James
Beanie the Weinie Howell,
(how could he be the #1 ref?)
would immediately feel sorry
for the tiny tyke and call some

while out on Bail’’. In-
cidentally, he included
numerous footnotes from Mar-
vin Barnes’ bestseller “My
Ten Best Crimes”. Keep hit-
ting those books Mo.

Next our close friend and
associate Fessor Moose
Leonard. We'll leave him with
just one question: Is Fessor
Leonard’s height in inches
higher or lower than his I.Q.?

Darrell Elston had to be
selected if only because he is

outrageous charge.

Monte begs us to feel sorry
for him and we really do. Wait
until next year when Davidson
has Tommy the Beached
Whale Verlin run over this lit-
tle pre-pubic nosehair for
good. Muhahahahaha.

The other guard is probably
not too well known but any
well-versed weinie expert
would acknowledge Ronnie
‘Red Runt’’ Lyon’s as a sure

This midget would run
around doing absolutely no
good while making more noise
than the entire University of
Kentucky cheering section.

To tell the truth C.A. & Y.B.
entered this guard ahead of
Darrell Elston just to rag on
Bob Quincy, our all Weinie

writer. Bob has this
thing about putting somebody
in Carolina Blue on every all
so-and-so team in the nation.
Tough break on this one
though. Boy are we nasty.

Tom Roy may follow in Tur-

days but for now his virtuous

him honorable mention.
