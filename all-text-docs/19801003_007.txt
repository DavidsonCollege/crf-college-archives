October 3, 1980—The Davidsonian—7

Johnny Mayhew slops the hogs for Slater.

Have you ever wondered
what happens to that leftover
spaghetti or scrambled eggs
when you haven’t the appetite
to finish what’s left on your
plate? Dissatisfied with the
answers my imagination pro-
duced, I went on a quest for the
man who handles | huge
amounts of scraps produced by
the Davidson eating houses.

The quest led me to Eden
Street, where sat a yellow,
single story house with a
friendly German Shepherd wich
bounced up to greet me. In
answer to my knock, out came
Johnny Mayhew. He was an
elderly black man with a friend-
ly smile.

His jean overalls bore the soil
of a day or two’s work. He
wore an old hat that said ‘“‘CAT
diesel power.’” The brown skin
of his hands was weathered and
supple, and his handshake
made me feel at home. Johnny
sat me down in an easy chair
and reclined on the nearby sofa.
He and the sofa fit together
perfectly. Johnny lit a cigarette
and sat up.

Johnny collects all the left-
over food and slop from Rich-
ards, Bailey, SAE and Phi Delt
houses each afternoon with his
green ’51 Chevy pickup for
eight years now he has been
taking this refuse out to his pig
farm, four miles northeast of
Davidson. “My father bought
25 acres, and then he sold four
and a half acres to Shell's
Chapel,” said Johnny.

Johnny’s father willed the

farm to his grandchildren who
now own the pigs. Still, Johnny
runs the farm himself. ‘‘I grew
up on a farm and I’m the only

one who can do the job,”’ he said —

with a laugh. Twenty-five pigs,
including twelve piglets, wel-
come the mixture of ground feed
and Slater scraps.

The pigs are taken each year
to a markét near Statesville,
where they are auctioned off.
These markets are places of
quick exchange. Dealers buy
farm animals, slaughter them
and sell them at wholesale
prices to supermarkets and
individuals. They also supply
the wholesale food dealers who,
in turn, supply our own eating
houses. Yes, that deja vu
feeling you had when you
scraped your plate last night
was justified.

Besides being an experienced
hog farmer, Johnny Mayhew
works for the Mecklenburg
County School System. He does
maintainance and cleaning work
at the different schools to help
out where he is needed. John-
ny’s ready chuckle and soft:
smile made me think he would
be great with children. Judging
from the years he has spent in
the schools arid from the dy-
nasty which he heads, I’m
pretty sure I was right.

When asked how may child-
ren he had, Johnny had to sit
back and think. “Annie, Mil-
dred, Evelyn, John Lee, Jeze-
bel, Daisy, and Floyd,’’ he
counted. Minnie, his wife, was

“there to help count up the

grandchildren, which totaled
28. “Oh, I got grandchildren,

Bingham said his major ob-
jective for Davidson athletics is
“to improve the condition of the
minor sports.’’ Comparing
sports budgets to living condi-
tions, he quipped, “‘If basket-
ball were living in Beverly Hills,
football would be in Queens
Road West...and women’s and
minor sports somewhere in the
ghettos.”’

I’m open to any constructive
ideas you have,’ he told his
audience of students and facul-
ty members.

Bingham criticised the report

of the visiting athletic committe _

(see The Davidsonian, Septem-
ber 18, 1980) as ‘‘very poor.”
“It collected all the feelings of
people on campus—not object-

ive facts.”

Facts are needed—for exam-
ple, Bingham noted the impor-
tance of determining the money
to be saved by dropping the
football program to Divsion III.

“If it becomes obvious that
we cannot compete at the IAA
level—if it becomes economical-
ly unfeasible—then I will re-
commend that we get out.”

Similarly, if the basketball
team “has a number of unsu-
cessful seasons, the Trustees
and alumni would ask for a
change,’ Bingham said, add-
ing, however, ‘‘I think the team
will be sucessful.”’

Next Year’s athletic budget
will be based on an. objective
analysis of need, according to

great-grandchildren” he smiled
with a wave of his hand. ‘‘Sixty-
seven in all.’’ ‘‘Sixty-nine,”’
Minnie corrected from her
chair across the room. ‘Two

Johnny Mayhew doesn’t own this pig.

How does a couple accom-
plish this in a lifetime? ‘‘we had
our 52nd anniversary last Nov-
ember,’’ said Johnny. He and
his wife both chuckled with
pleasant memories. ‘‘O Lord,
don’t say nothing!’’ Minnie
replied. It had been quite an

Bingham. ‘‘In October we will
begin a process to determine
how much money will be needed
for all the sports.”’

This will also give more
specific sport-by-sport goals for
fundraising.

‘For example, there is a need
for a full time baseball coach,”
Bingham said.

While 60% of the funds of the

Wildcat Club now go towards °

the football program, Bingham
said that after the ‘‘Budget
setting process a certain per-
centage will go to [other sports]
according to their needs.”’
Bingham considers scholar-
ships for minor sports unne-
cessary. ‘‘We can recruit,’’ he
explained, on the basis of
Davidson’s quality alone.

Nor does he think women
want athletic scholarships. If
Title IX should require them, he
added, ‘‘the Wildcat Club will
cover it.”

The secret to increased fund-
raising for athletics, Bingham
said, will be obtaining new
funds from specific sports con-
stituencies—alumni interested
in baseball or soccer, for exam-
ple.

Student athletes could help in
fundraising. Indeed, Bingham
said he saw nothing wrong with
individual academic depart-
ments raising money for them:
selves.’’ This would not lead to
competition, he said. All-money
given to the College is ‘‘well-
spent.” :

event; Will Terry had opened up
the Center for Special Studies
for a family reunion.

Johnny told me about the
celebration: ‘‘Reverend Terry
said, ‘The College is giving an
appreciation, we want you to
come to the appreciation.’ Min-
nie put on a long evening gown,
I dressed up with a nice suit.
Mr. Terry picked us up in front
of our doorstep, took us up
there, took me and Minnie to
the door, stopped, went in to
make sure everything was OK

' then opened both doors wide,
,and me and Minnie were stand-

ing there and pictures were
clicking and lights’ flashing
(looked like lightning!) and it
was a pride, a packed full house,
white and black, Yes sir.’’

They proudly showed a chest-
ful of crystal and glassware
given them that day. Johnny
sat back with one leg up on the
sofa, stroking his whiskers,
gazing at the wall. “That was’
nice, we really enjoyed .that,”’
said Minnie.

Minnie has worked at Will
Terry’s house for 15 years.
Lately he.calls on her when he is
having company and needs help
in preparing for it, although she
does work regularly each Fri-
day. She had great respect for
Terry’s ability to cook. ‘‘He can
cook anything he wants.”

Johnny and Minnie Mayhew
have lived in Davidson all of
their lives. Their friendship has
probably had some effect on
their longevity. Johnny is 72.
He must know his farm like he
knows the back of the hand that
has worked it for so many
years. Johnny’s goodbyes were
“You come on back soon so I
can take you out to see the
