Erratic Cats Meet Young Wake Forest

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Asst. Sports Editor

After falling to Duke in a
close home match and thump-
ing Richmond last Saturday,
the Davidson Wildcats begin a
final trek towards the Southern
Conference Tournament.

Tomorrow night, the Cats

host a vastly improved Wake
Forest team. ,

The Deacs are ‘‘a young team
as far as having played
together” according to David-
son coach Terry Holland. *‘They
have a good guard offense."’

A return bout with East
Carolina is set for next Wed-
nesday night in the Pirates’

DRIVING FOR THE HOOP

gymnasium. Holland thinks
that this game will ‘‘be im-
portant for both clubs. They will
be better than they were up
here."

The lack of board strength
was evident in the Duke contest.

rebounds to the Cats’ 29. But the

New, Experienced Cagers Mix
On First JV Basketball Team

By JIM SITTERSON
Asst. Sports Editor

The junior varsity basketball
team has compiled a 5-2 record
thus far into the season. Coach
Jim Larranaga is more than
pleased with the blend of fresh-
men and upperclassmen on the
team.

As a result of the NCAA ruling
which makes freshmen eligible
for varsity competition many
schools, Davidson included,
have dropped = freshmen
athletic programs.

Consequently, a freshman
unable to make a varsity team
is often relegated to sitting on
the JV bench.

“A coach can really ruin a
good player who needs the ex-
perience,” said Larranaga.

“The freshman sits on the
bench and ‘sees little playing
time. Soon he begins to lose con-
fidence in himself. The only ex-
perience he gets is in practice,
Larranaga added.

Happily, this is not the case
on the Wildkittens this year.
The leading scorer and reboun-
der are both freshmen.
Larranaga is quite happy with
the progress being made by
Tom Verlin and Ed Yeaton.

Verlin is the Kittens leading
scorer with 126 points in seven
games for an 18 point average.

“Tom had to made the switch
from a high school forward to a
college guard,” Larranaga ex-
plained. .

“I'm very pleased with the
way he’s been progressing.”
Larranaga added.

Ed Yeaton has also made a
switch from his accustomed
position. With the departure of
Sheldon Parker to the varsity
and the injury to Eppa Rixey,
Yeaton has had to take over the
center spot for the JVs.

‘Ed is the biggest guy on our
team right now,” Larranaga
explained.

‘He used to play forward in
high school but now he has to
play in the middle a lot more
and he has to guard the other
team's post man on defense.”
added Larranaga.

Yeaton is leading the JVs in
rebounding with 59 rebounds
and ranks as the second leading
scorer behind Verlin.

omores Joe Duncan and
Jim Cuttino add ‘depth and ex-
perience to the team,” ac-
cording to Larranaga. Both
played on last year's freshman
team.

Larranaga felt that their

added a steadying in-
fluence on the team. Duncan is
leading the team in assists and
had the high game of the year
for assists with five against
Montreat-Anderson. Cuttino
has been one of the most steady
and consistent players for the
team all year, according to
Larranaga.

Jim Lowry star-
ted the season on the varsity but
an injury placed him out of ac-
tion and he has since moved to
the JVs. Although Lowry has
appeared in only two games to
date, Larranaga felt that he is
the key to the offensive success

of the team.

“Jim is our ball handler out
there, he runs the team,"’ said
Larranaga.

Larranaga also cited the ef-
forts of juniors Bob Vander
Griend and Mike Harding.

The team's only losses this
year have been to the Clemson
and Duke JV teams. Their next
game is with Wake Forest
tomorrow night in Charlotte.

Cats were able to stay in the
game due to 31 Duke turnovers.

‘We pressed them and forced
the turnovers late in the game,”
said Holland. “‘They are the
best team that we have played
this year. They really hurt us in-
side."

Chris Redding, a 6-8 senior,
paced the strong inside game
for the Blue Devils as he con-
nected on eight of 14 from the
field, while hitting 12 of 14 at the
charity stripe. He added a
game-high of 10 rebounds to his
28 point total.

Early in the game Duke was
able to penetrate inside by hit-
ting center Alan Shaw at the top
of the key for a lead pass to
either Redding, Bob Fleischer
or Kevin Billerman near the
basket.

Gary Melchioni directed the
Duke attack from his backcourt
spot, while throwing in 18 points.
Billerman was the other
Blue Devil in double figures. as
he dropped in 17 and handed out
six assists.

Greg Dunn shot eight of 12
from the field but only six of 11
from the foul line as he led the
Davidson scoring with 22 points.
Mike Sorrentino and John
Falconi hit 18 and 16 points,
respectively. Sorrentino direc-
ted the pressure defense that
forced Duke into numerous turn-
overs and gave the Wildcats a
shot at the win.

The victory slipped away at
the free throw line, however, as
Dunn and Jay Powell missed
key free throws with under 30
seconds to play.

“We had our chances to win
the game, but the missed foul
shots killed us,’’ explained
Holland. ‘‘Duke has to be the
best 7-8 team in the world.”

The Richmond contest was
quite a different story. After
being up by as much as 17 points
midway through the first half,
Davidson had to be content to
coast to a 12 point win, 89-77.

“The only complaint in the
Richmond game was that we
only won by twelve,” said
Holland. ‘‘We should have
broken the game open, but we
could not do it. We just let them
get back in the ball game. We
should have put it away.”’

Falconi paced the Cat
barrage as he pumped in 18
points, on eight of 13 from the
field. Sorrentino bagged seven
of 10 from the floor and totaled
16. Dunn and Larry Horowitz

had 13 and 12, respectively.

Aron Stewart blasted 15 of 30
field attempts and nine of 10
charity shots to lead the game
with 39 points. Jeff Snider ad-
ded 13 for the Spiders.

In Saturday night’s match-up
with the Demon Deacons, the
Cats will be out to even up their
record against ACC foes. After
beating Clemson, Davidson has
fallen to NC State and Duke.

Coach Carl Tacy will sport
premier guard Tony Byers, who
has been burning the nets for
the Deacs. The junior college
transfer not only paces the
Wake scoring but also rates
high in the conference race.

At the other backcourt slot,
Tacy will have Eddie Payne. He
is averaging in double figures
also.

Holland talked of some new
strategy for the Wake contest.
“‘We probably will not press,”
he said. ‘‘We will also use some
zone defenses to try and keep
them outside. But if Byers and
Payne are hot, we will have to
go toa man-for-man.”’

The battle with ECU is a very
important game as far as the
Southern Conference race is
concerned.

The Pirates will also have the
home court advantage, which
has been very important in
recent ECU-Davidson en-
counters.

Holland still sees the SC as a
three-team affair.

“I would have to say that Fur-
man is the favorite at this
point,”’ he explained. ‘‘Looking
at their size, and
record, they are the easy
favorites. We will just have to
keep them from getting the ball

The Cats are entering the
crucial period of their schedule.
Nine games away is the
Southern Conference tourney at
Richmond.

Six of those nine games are
with conference foes. Davidson

to win at least five of
those games to hold the top
seeding in the tournament, and
one win must be against Fur-
man.

With only a 9-6 record, a
national ranking is almost
totally out of the question for
Davidson, as Holland sees it.

‘“‘We need to get a winning
streak going and not break it
before tournament time,”’
Holland explained. ‘‘We would
like very much to be 19-6 when
we hit the road to Richmond.”’

Powell ‘Puts Basketball First’

Dedication is the most im-
portant element of a basketball
player, and one can usually find
more dedication in a first-year
player than a seasoned veteran.
To be dedicated, a player
must put basketball first. That
is exactly what Jay Powell

does.

The 6-1 freshman from
Youngstown, Ohio thinks that
basketball is ‘“‘the most im-

“I guess they thought I was
worth playing for Davidson,”

Powell chose Davidson over

Virginia, and others, becuse he
