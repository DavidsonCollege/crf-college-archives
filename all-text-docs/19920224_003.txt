During the ‘meeting held on Tuesday, February 18, John Burns
(SPE Senator) and the ad hoc committee on Minus Grades presented a
report encouraging professors to change their grading scales, as well as
the requirements for honor societies. The report will not be approved,
however, until further adjustments are made.

Vice President Alden Smith discussed the faculty ’s concerns Shit
the level of nois¢ in the dorms, and how they wish toextend quiet hours,

‘as well as possibly institute a quiet dorm. A study by Junior President

Joe Cook and Blair Harkness showed that students are generally not
concerned with the level of: noise in the dorms, and that they donot think
it should be an-issue.

‘In other news, after approving the Piidivetnhy Club charter, the
Senate made several other approvals: Erin Lee as ROAD (Reach-Out
Across Davidson) President, Lawson McWhorter and Lannie Bennet
for the Student Conduct Council, Chris Freer for, the Review Board,
Max Hyde as the Elections Council Chairman, Rob Webb as Junior

‘Senator, Marie Huntington as Sophomore Senator, and 1 Burrows as

Freshman Senator.

ulturalism: “the golden rule,” “right the wrongs,” and “value all differ-
ences.” She also mentioned the flaws in each of these ways. In relation
to the “golden rule,” she said you can’t treat all people the same because
each of usis different, Regarding the “right all wrongs” method, Wilson
said we can only appease people for so long before problems start to
occur. And lastly, dealing with the “value all differences” approach,
Wilson said, “I’m sick of Black Awareness Week. We need to seagnize
all these cultures all the time, not just for a week.” Ler

According to Wilson, the campus has a problem, and we need to deal
with itnow. She offered a number of initiatives to begin our process of
breaking the barriers. First Wilson said it is important that the entire
college community understand the problem and committo finding solu-
tions. One way to support the commitment is to provide monetary re-
sources. Another way is to develop a plan with actions and goals. In
order for us to reach success, we must continue the dialogue and be will-
ing to take risks.

Themost striking thing Wilson said is that we, as students, partof our
college community, must examine ourselves - our values and our atti-
tudes. She contends this is especially important when electing student
leaders. Wilson said we need to elect those who will guide or lead us
toward true multiculturalism.

the topic of discussion to the link-
age of traits. Along with David L,
Whittaker and Donald L.

Copeland, Graham published a
scientific report: in: 1962 on Link-
age of Color Blindness to Hemo-
philias A and B. They found that
color blindness is more frequently
linked with Hemophilia A than
Hemophilia B because of the
closer proximity of the A gene to
the colorblindness gene on the
chromosome.

Graham provided a detailed
discussion of many of his own
findings, including the ones men-
tioned above, and also recognized

’ the fact that one can retrieve infor-

mation from a gene in a “long
day”, emphasizing the speed of
today’s genetic technology.
