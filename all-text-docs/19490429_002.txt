As far as policy changes
Mae Hart has left us little room indeed for

dent body. Our primary hope is that it will

having conducted our social affairs with un-
paralleled success.

We believe, however, that
large number of students who would favor
an alteration of procedure for the coming
year which would reduce the total
of a dance week-end from fifteen to twen,
five dollars down to five or ten, The price
of the set ti¢kets plus the price of the fra-
ternity banquets, plus-the expense of

Of course it is nice to casually mention to
your best girl that Beneke’s playing for the
dances; However, it’s-otr—opinion—that the
difference in the quality of ‘‘danceable”’
musi¢ does ngt justify the difference in the
amount of United States currency required
to procure the big names as compared to
bands of the Dean Hudson variety.

We are not pointing a finger at the Spring
Frolics week-end. A majority of the stu-
dent body voted that it be just as it was.
That that was what we wanted was evident.
However, because of our now-in-effect
eighty-five per cent plan, those members of
the student. body who did not vote affirma-
tively in the issue, were still required to,
produce their share of the heavy expense.
There is nothing amiss even in this fact,
provided that students know before joining
a fraternity that they will be~expected to
contribute varying sums up to — possibly
twenty dollars per dance week-end-—if they

are to take part in all of the’social activities”

planned for them.

We propose, therefore, in order to reduce
the overall cost, that the quota of members
required to attend from each fraternity be
reduced to sixty-five per cent and the fra-
ternities request the Pan Hellenic Council
through their individual representative to
secure less well known bands, if necessary,
to keep within the sixty-five per cent mar-
gin. Perhaps we are in error, but we believe

that such an alteration would make it possi-.

ble for us to have one or two Hudson or

_Thornhill class week-ends during the’ year

and at the same time lessen the burden on
the student unable to meet the expenses of
the higher price week-ends. Let’s hear what

“STRIKE IT RICH”

A stirring story of the East

Texas oil boom of 1929.31, "Strike
It Rich,” Jack Wrathers Allied
Artists production which comes
to the Davidson Theater on Friday
and Saturday is said to bring a re-
freshingly different type of picture
to the screen,
’ Co-starring Rod Cameron,
Bonita Granville and Don Castle,
the saga of Texas’ hot-oil days has
a cast of featured players including
Stuart Erwin, Lloyd Corrigan and
Ellen Corby.

In addition to its main theme of
the proration of oil in Texas, and
the efforts of the authorities to en-
force it, “Strike It Rich” carries a
love interest involving Cameron,
Miss Granville and Castle. Cast
as friendly enemies, Cameron and
Castle experience an enmity which
grows as the story unfolds, cul-
minating in a _ fight sequence
described as'one of the most ex-
citing ever recorded by the
cameras. Miss Granville is cast as
the girl friend of Castle, whose
romance is broken up handily by
Cameron, who marries the girl.
When Bonita and Rod make a rich
oil strike, they realize that the
boom enveloping East Texas will
quickly rid the ground of the vast
oil pools unless proration or the
rationing of oil, is imposed.

But Don and— Bonita’s--father,
Lloyd Corrigan, who have also
struck oil, refuse to submit to the
proration, The terrific fight be-
tweenRod and Don brings the
story to its climax.

Filmed for authenticity’s sake in
the actual fields where the oil pro-
ration problem originally occurred,
in East Texas, “Strike It Rich”
shows the actual towns of Kilgore,
Lindale and Tyler, Texas, all with-
in an approximate radius of 100
miles from Dallas.
