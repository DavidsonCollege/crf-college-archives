Self-Study Sent To Association

By MASON STEPHENSON
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Yesterday Davidson College
presented its Self-Study Report
to a seven-man evaluation com-
mittee of the Southern Associa-
tion of Colleges and Universi-
ties (SACU).

This report is the result of
18 months of work by faculty
committees under the direction :
of a steering committee. Accord- |
ing to Dr. Frontis Johnston,
dean of the faculty, every fac-:
ulty member who was at David-
son two years ago is serving on
a committee.

The report itself consists of
nine chapters. The first gives
the history and purpose of the
college, and the others examine
different aspects of the college:
Organization and Administra-
tion, Educational Program, Fi-
nancial Resources, Faculty, Li-
brary, Student Personnel, Physi-
cal Plant and Research.

This report, which was com-
piled under the direction of Dr.
C. J. Pientenpol, professor
emeritus of physics, was pre-
sented to the SACU as part of
the requirement for accredita- |
tion. The report is required by
each member school’ every 10
years.

President Martin stated at the
initation of the evaluation in
1963: ‘We may as well put a
real effort into it and seek to
improve Davidson with specific|
proposals.”

The faculty and adminisira-_
tion have put many long hours!
into the preparing of the re-
ports. For instance, the Edu-:
cational Program Committee
has conferred with visiting au-
thorities, evaluated Davidson's
program and compared their:
findings with similar self-studies -
of such schools as Amherst, Wil-!
liams, Reed and Carleton.

The Student Affairs Commit: :
tee has investigated such as: |
pects of student life as frater-.
nities, dormitory life, social life,
athletics, academics and cul- |
tural activities.

Concerning the usefulness of
the report to the college, John-
ston said, “The recommenda-
tions in the chapters will be be-
fore us for study.”

The evaluation committee of
the SACU, to whom the report
was presented yesterday, will!
