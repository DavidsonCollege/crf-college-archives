‘WE’RE ALL PEOPLE’

Coeds Express Their Views Of Davidson

By ALEC HOON
Staff Writer
RUSS MERRITT
Associate Editor

ED NOTE: The following in-
terview is a transcript of a

taped interview by THE
DAVIDSONIAN last Tues-_

day. -
DAVIDSONIAN: The idea

of co-education at Davidson
has been kicked around by
the college for several years
Now that we actually do have
co-education, in a very limit:
ed sense, do you as David.
son's first co-eds feel that
the process will be success:
ful.

KAREN QUANT: The boys
I've talked to so far don't
seem to want it, and if the
boys don’t want it, it seems

to me that they won't ap-
preciate complete co-educa
tion. They might. be, able to
get used to it, though.
“CATHY ROSS: Possibly it
may work better on a limit-
ed basis until the students
are used to it.

DAVIDSONIAN: Does this
mean that you feel that the
Davidson student cannot and
will not accept co-eds here”
as fellow students? Dp you
feel the majority of boys
want you here?

MISS* ROSS: I think they
do, but I don’t think they
like the idea of being com
pletely co-educational. I don’t
think it would work right
now, although it might work
later.

van Allen Laments. Cities,
eceives Laws Doctorate

Davidson's second annual
opening convocation began
in formal academic proces-
sion and ended in a student
led standing ovation.

The. convocation, which
has been heralded by some
college officials aS the, finest
set of tandem academic ad-
dresses in recent Davidson
history, was formally key-
noted by former Atlanta ma-
yor Ivan Allen Jr.

Allen's address on the pro-
blems of America’s cities
was followed by a luncheon
address by James W. Rouse
primarily concerning the
c’ty of Columbia, Maryland
which the Rouse Company
is building.

It was this speech which

students of the class of ‘71
greeted with at standing ova-
tion which eventually includ
ed most of the parents in
the audience.

Allen told the assembled
students at the convocatior
Monday that today’s youth
‘‘must address inlaid

to the problem of the city.”\ x

There they will find over- ~
crowing,
ing, faulty transportation
facilities, and inadequate job
opportunities, largely be-
cause state legislatures have
failed to provide adequate
planning, Aid, and services.

«Allen, speaking on ‘‘Urban
Problems,’ also noted that
commuters who live in the
surburbs have _ abdicated

Speaking before group of
press reporters and camera-

our ability to raise funds.
State officials move in only
when they are garrying out
federal programs.

‘We've seen a decrease in
power of the state govern-
ment because of its failure

to involve“itself in the issues
the people are faced with.”

Allen suggested that states

municipal governments.

A basic problem of the
cities, according to Allen, is
that most of the city officials
are not trained in urban pro-
blems.

He did say however that
this situation is being recti-
fied by ‘‘more dedication of
young activists who have had
some training in these pro-
blems. These people are be-
ginning to come into local
government.”

Allen attributed his suc-
cess. as mayor of Atlanta to
the business structure of the
city ‘It has almost become
a contest to see which
businessman could be the
most dedicated to the city.
“All I had to do was to find
a project and ask the right
people to do it. They had or
felt some—responsibility — to
the city,’’ he said.

their responsibility to the
urban area as a whole, leav-
ing the «city governments
with inadequate revenue.

In such a situation, Allen
said, cities can only turn to
the federal government.
Such innovations as the
“war an poverty’ and model
cities program he regards
as positive steps.

Allen, who dealt vigorous-
ly with racial discrimination
during his eight years as
mayor of Atlanta, said that
most abuses have been eli-
minated, Fair housing is the
great problem now.

(Mayor Allen predicted that
Davidson's seniors would
live in a freer
open society, and expressed
his confidence that free en
terprise has ‘a great. cap-
ability for making changes.”

After his address, Allen
was conferred with an honor-

ary degree of Doctor of
Laws,
Rouse continued Allen's

theme of city problems in
discussing his company's
attempt to develop a city

ton, D. C.

short time that you've. been
here, have you eaperienced,
as a female in a previously
all‘male,g school, that you
have been accepted for other
than superficial reasons?

CONNIE LOWRANCE:

Everyone's accepted me, I
I feel. Everyone's been very
friendly.

BETH YOUNG: And it's
been as people rather than
just as girls. The faculty,
the staff, the students —
everybody has been so
friendly. a

DAVIDSONIAN: Many peo-
ple have openly wondered at
how the actual classroom
procedure will be altered
Have
you felt in any way that a
professor has been prejudic-
ed either for or against you,
since your preseyce in the
classroom is so évident?

MISS YOUNG: Well, the
first five days the professors
would make some comment
‘like “Well, gentlemen, and
ladies too.” But now they
don’t seem to pay any special
attention to me.

MISS LOWRANCE: | feel
like my professors are ner-
vous about my being in their
classes. | think that they
are really wondering if we
should compete on the some
level as boys. They’ve been
waiting in my classes for me
fo say something to see if
my mind is anywhere near
the boys’, either above or be-
low.

DAVIDSONIAN: From
what you’ve observed so far,
Is the work foad of your
classes here more or less
than that at your respective
schools?

CAROL DANIEL: It’s eas-
ier.

MISS DANIEL: I don't
know about the reviews, but
the calculus reading is much
easier here than at Hollins.
DAVIDSONIAN: The Char-

lotte News story on you stat
ed that you came to David-
son strictly for academic
reasons. Have you found your
hopes in Davidson’s academic
process to be fullfilled? Are
you getting out of the class-

“room what you wanted?

MISS ROSS: | think that
first of all you must qualify
what you mean by “‘aca-
demic.” It’s more than just
getting a course that you

want or finding a professor
that’s right up your alley.

DAVIDSONIAN: Then let's
call it the ‘‘educational-ex:
perience.”

MISS ROSS: It’s a_ little
early so say that. I think,
though, that it looks like it’s

going to be a lot of what
T had hoped for.
MISS DANIEL: I've been

really impressed by the at-
titude the guys here have

out of class about studying.
At a girls’ school, you squeeze
your studying in whenever
you can, Even guys I know
here that are pretty much
party-oriented sit down at
night, and study.

are on that subject, what is

Honors Program

By GRAY WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor

The Educational Policy
‘Committee (EPC), now
headed by Dr. John M. Be-
van, kicked off the year
with a general meeting last
Monday.

Bevan, Vice President for
Academic Affairs,” Said the
Purpose was ‘'to raise issues
for discussion and to get
clarifications on certain mat-
ters of policy.”

Extended Studies has top
priority before the EPC. Be-
van hopes to have the five
student - faculty committees
organized as soon as possi

ble.

“The meeting included a
short briefing session for
Bevan to familiarize him as
to where the committee
Stands, but specific action
was taken in a couple of
areas,

With respect to
mental honors, it
e:ded that the Honors Col
lege would be allowed to
function on its own without
outside restrictions.

This gives the faculty. of
the Honors program com-
plete autonomy in admitting,
directing, and _ evaluation
their students.

The committee also con-
sidered students programs

Three course credits will
be awarded to the students

One of the credits may
serve as an Extended Study

and this option also stands
for juniors and seniors if
the work has been approved
in their respective majors.

Among other subjects dis-
cussed were self-scheduled

Suggestions for the eval
uation of the faculty were
entertained, some of which

may include student partici
pation.

The EPC also questioned
the validity of the grading
system at Davidson, and Be-
van expressed concern over
“the applicability of the
grade point and quality point
aevrages.”’

The EPC convenes re-
gularly the first and third
‘Monday of each month, and
any open meetings will be
announced.

ny Clodfelter, student mem-
ber of the Academic Affa‘rs
Committee.

Extended study ‘can be
done in one of three ways:
a seminar, individual read-
ing from a prepared list of
texts in preperation for an
area exam or research pa
per, or a regular course in
the curriculum during either
the freshman or sophomore
year.

All extended study courses
are on the pass-fail system,
and carry an = academ‘c
credit.

Five committees are to be

appointed, one from each
area of study and one inter-
area group, to-help students
set up the manner in which
they wish to take their ex-
tended study.

“This is an extemely
flexible - system,"’ comment:
Clodfelter, “and will allow

the individual student to ful-
fill his study requirements
in the way he wishes.”

During his junior and sen-
ior years: the student only
works in the area of his ma-
jor. His freshman and soph-
omore years the work must
be done in other areas.

Pat-

Wednesday show at least 21
persons have gone inactive
from fraternities in the two
weeks since school began.

College officials said this

figure 4 obably lower than
~ :
the a number of this

year’s ctives because it
counts only those who have
applied for a refund on their
fraternity housing fees.

This extraordinary num-
ber of inactives continues a
trend which was gaining mo-
mentum last spring. College
officials estimate that some
100 fraternity members drop-
ped out last year.

Last April THE DAVID
SONIAN reported that this
academic year would begin
with only 538 fraternity mem-
bers.

That prediction has proven
somewhat inflated: The busi-
ness office now’ counts only
475 fraternity members, bas-
ed on the exact number of
persons it is billing for fra-
ternity housing “Tees.

With these figures in hand,
college president Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. announced
Wednesday he will speak to
the college community Mon-
day on the fraternity issue
and others,

Although Spencer declin
ed to comment on the content
of the speech beforehand,
sources close to the presi-
dent said he would probably
publicly endorse the re-
commendations of the Stu-
dent Life Committee (SLC)
on fraternities.

The SLC report ciatts. for
gradual denationalization of
the court over a three-year
period and random assign-
ment of freshmen to houses.
In effect, the plan would re-
place fraternities with non-
selective eating clubs.

The SLC plan would bar
freshmen from pledging ‘na-
tional -houses in the first

year. ‘Pledges’ would take
the status of ‘local brothers,”
and, they would be randomly
assigned; not rushed.

The SLC report does not
have the force of Law, but
is only advisory to the presi-
dent and the trustees. Only
the trustees have the author-
ity to implem Its recom-
mendations, Spencer said.

Unimpeachable sources in-
dicated the report will. be
forwarded to the trustees’
social ‘life committee with
Spencer’s endorsement of
most of its points.

The proposal could be act-
ed upon as early as Oct. 16,
when the trustees hold their
fall meeting on campus. This
item has not been placed
on the agenda yet, however,
it had not been decided what
Spencer would say in _ his
Monday speech, whether it
would deal on campus social _
life “or on specific recom-
mendations. 0

The speech has been set
for Monday morning at 10
a.m. in Spencer Love Audi-
torium.

Sources close to the SLC
Said the committee had dis-

cussed several eating ar-
rangements alternative to

the present fraternity set-up.
They discussed, but did not
recommend, one central eat-
ing facility for all students.
The final proposal is thus
interpreted as a final ar-

rangement, allowing for 12
eating clubs and a central
union.

College officials have view-
ed with some alarm the
crowded college union cafe
teria.

During the. past week,
breakfast lines have stretch-
ed outside the cafeteria, and
on at\least one occasion the
serving line had to be stop-
ped until places could be
cleared for students to be
seated.

is uncertain since  sopho-

Foster said ‘that about 50
students have signed con-

He indicated that “I am
certainly not discouraged by
this number.”

Several other students are
expected to sign their con
tracts in the near future,

“There has been very lit-
tle change in the format of
the ROTC program. since
last year,” said Foster,
“Hower, I would like to do
something different to di-
versify the program and in-

crease interest, but there
seems to be very little lead-

Foster added, ‘* It would
