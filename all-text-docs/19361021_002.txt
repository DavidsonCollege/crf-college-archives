“Allegiance to a party should never lead one con-

lic weal"-—William Howard Tait.

ROOSEVELT vs. LANDON ... The David-
sonian sincerely appreciates the co-operation
of the students and faculty members in the
Tecent canvass oi the coming presidential elec-
tion. A greater pereent of returns were re-
corded ia this balloting than has been regis-
tered im previous elections.

Because of the interest shown by the stu-
dents in the coming election on November 4.
The Davidsonian is sponsoring two addresses
by prominence political leaders in the Demo-
cratic and Kepublican parties today. These
addresses will be held in Shearer Mail on Oc-
tober 27, (Democratic). amd Qetober 30, (Re-
publican).

These speakers will present the issues in-
volved in their national party platform. Harold
Sugg (Democrat) and Tyler Port (Republi-
can) will conduct the campaign of their..re-
spective parties.

The returns irom the straw vote on the
coming president will be held over until the
next issue of this publieation because of the
political speeches that will be held next week.

PLACEMENT BUREAU... Fred. Smith,
alumni secretary, has made a decided step in
helping students secure jobs when they finish
Davidson by the establishment of a much
necded Piacement Bureaw. Formerly, several
of the professocs offered considerable assist-
ance along thts line and they can continue to
aid the graduating Davidson student in assist-

ing the \iumini Secretary. —

PHI BETA KAPPA... Our hearty congrat-
ulations to those who have just received bids
to Phi Beta Nappa. To win membership: in
this, the parent of ali American college {ra-
ternities, is indeed an honor. These men arc
signally honored in that they come from a
class whase scholastic average is unusually
high. Not in several years has there been so
much competition for a place in the upper
tenth. Nice going, fellows!

BAND INCOGNITO... Those Davidson sup-
porters’ who listened to the braadcast of the
Duke-Tech game Saturday were both intér-
ested and amused to hear on two separate oc-
casions that they were listening to the Dav-
idson band. Corrections were made each
time, however. The announcer seems to have
had the Davidson band on his mind.

HAZING . . . Seetion 6, Article V, says: No
student shall be guilty of engaging in any
form of hazing whatsoever. Webster’s Col-
legiate Dictionary defines HAZING as “‘a har-
assment by abusive or ridiculous treatment.”
This explanation is to correct the prevailing
idea that hazing consists in applying the
paddle to Freshmen, and other means of physi-
cal torture. From Webster’s definition hazing
consists equally in treating an individual in a
ridiculous manner.

This has been a quiet week-end
for most of us, with alt our cxcite-
ment coming over the radio on Sat-
urday afternoon, The Duke-Tech
game was a thriller from start to
finishyand surely deserved the, large
crowd it drew. And a Jot of these
B-C sports announcers probably had
to take some of their own medicine
when the Devils reversed their pre-
dictions. Chuckle-jerker from the
radio- announcer at this clash: “We
ought to stop now for station iden-
tification—but I'll be darned if we'll
do it!”

Kernel has just learned that a dam
was removed from the creek and

worth a dam.

OPEN LETTER

OPEN FORUM

Please, Gentlemen of the class of
1940, don't pass us by on the street
without a greeting. I realize that
some of you have condescended
upon Davidson College very lordly
from.prep schodls and from the
set apart-upper clement of the more
distinguished high schools, but in
spite of your overshadowing im-
portance and the fact. that the col-
lege could not for a day get along
without you, dan’t you think you
might spare an occasional friendly
word to the lowly upper classmen?

When 1 speak to members of
the upper classes, gen the seniors,
and are snubbed. for a reply. it
hurts to the core; but when T[ hail
a freshman with a “Gentlemen” or
“good morning” and are given the
glassy stare it makes us feel, so low
that the red bugs could call us
“shorty.”

There is something on the card
in your rooms about freshmen
showing respect to upper classmen.
The alt-round best way to do this
is to be -genuinely friendly and

‘courteous at all times.

Sincerely J. B.

Dear Editor:

We certainly enjoyed Dr. Sand-
burg’s lecture recently—those of us
who were there. It is unfortunate
that our special lectures always
come on Monday night, as many
persons who would otherwise be
there are forced to stay away, to
their own detriment. The staff of
The Davidsonian, freshmen and all,
number about fifty, and this group
always finds it extremely difficult
to ao-ordinate a Monday night lec-
ture and 11:30 deadline. Somehow,
too, reviews scem to have.a habit
of falling on Tuesday. Presumably,
this is an excellent day for reviews,
the preceding week-end having af-
forded ample time for preparation.
But when a review is to be held
on the day following a lecture, as
in the case of a number of classes
on the Tuesday following Dr. Sand-

burg’s flecture,~.many find it “im

possible to attend the special lec-
ture. For Monday night alsé are
scheduled the meetings of Eta Sig-
ma Phi and Delta Phi Alpha, on
alternate weeks at the lecture hour.
Wednesday night is often free,
and the last two nights of the week:
Thursday and Friday are always
free. As Monday is the busiest
could there not be an arrangement

to take -care of this?

Dear Nozy Broom:

Boy, how 1 hate you! Here FI sit,
week after week, trying to shell out
all the news that’s fit to print, and,
just as I'm getting the hang of it,
along you come with that other
kind of news and steal all my
readers. Do you realize that you
have cut my audience in half? That
only leaves mo one reader. And I'm
getting pretty tiredeof reading it
every week myself.

What's more, if I ever find out
who you are (not that I-blame you
for trying té_kcep it a secret), I’m
going to print it in two places: (1)
in this column on Wednesday, and
(2) on your tombstone on Thursday.

|The Davidsonian carries a story
which says that “Scripts and

be out in a short time. Assuming
that for once The Davidsonian is+
right, this is a serious matter, be-
cause, you know, there’s no way to
keep from getting one. However,
you've got fair warning, if you can
think of a way to avoid it.

Kernel notices that there are to
be twelve guest. bands on hand at
the Citadel game. Well, that’s one
way to fill the new grand stand. At -
the last game, two bands gave an
imitation of a canon shooting men
out onto the field. With twelve
bands, we ought to get a musical
impression of the Spanish war.

shodting ought to be the other way
