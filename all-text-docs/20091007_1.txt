Heading into Tuesday’s much
anticipated match-up with no. 6
Duke, there were some questions
about whether the Davidson men’s
soccer team was as good as their
record indicated. There will be no
more doubting.

In front of a raucous overflow
crowd of over 1,500 at Alumni
Stadium, the Wildcats jumped out
to an early 2-0 lead in the opening
minutes and cruised to a dominat-
ing 4-1 victory over the Blue Dev-
ils. Yannick Pilgrim °11 led the
charge with two goals while Brian
McGue ’13 and Charlie Reiter ’10
also scored for the ’Cats.

Duke entered the game fresh
off a 2-0 shutout win over defend-
ing national champion and second-
ranked Maryland on Saturday, but
their shutout against the Wildcats
disappeared in the game’s third
minute. Reiter ’10, who was named
SoCon Player of the Week for his
performance in wins against Col-
lege of Charleston and Georgia
Southern last week, connected with
McGue °13 on a corner kick and
the freshman headed the ball into
the back of the net to propel the
’Cats to a 1-0 lead. The goal was
McGue’s first of his career.

Just minutes later, Garrett Bost-
wick ’12 found a streaking Pilgrim
with a beautiful pass at the corner
of the penalty box. Pilgrim took
one touch and fired the ball past the
diving Duke goalkeeper into the far
side netting to give the Wildcats a
commanding 2-0 advantage with
37 minutes remaining in the first
half.

The Blue Devils put more of-

fensive pressure on Davidson after
the early goals, but were unable to
find the back of the net until the 25"
minute when Matthew Thomas got
Duke on the board with a volley
off a free kick by teammate Cole
Grossman. Unfortunately for the
Blue Devils, it was the only time
on the night they would beat Wild-
cats’ goalkeeper Chip Sanders °12,
who finished the game with two
saves. Duke threatened for much
of the rest of the half, but with no
results and the score remained 2-1
at halftime.

As the momentum of the game
seemed to be drifting towards the
Blue Devils, the Cats opened the
second half with inspired play and

seized the momentum for good in
the 57" minute. Midfielder Josh
Zipin ’11 worked his way around a
couple of Blue Devil defenders and
unleashed a hard low drive from
just outside the penalty box. Duke
goalkeeper James Belshaw made a
diving save to his right, but the re-
bound caromed right to Reiter who
blasted the ball into the goal for his
seventh goal of the season.

The scored remained 3-1 until
the 77 minute when Pilgrim put
on a dazzling display of moves to
escape past two Duke defenders
into open space where the junior
forward proceeded to place a per-
fect left-footed shot past Belshaw
off the right post to ice the victory

for the Wildcats. The two goals give
Pilgrim seven goals on the season
and he is now tied with Reiter for
the team lead.

The 4-1 victory was Davidson’s
second victory this season over a
ranked opponent at Alumni Stadi-
um. On September 25, the Wildcats
took down South Carolina by an
identical 4-1 score.

The team’s record now stands
at 9-1-0 and they hope to protect
their 2-0-0 Southern Conference
record when they return to the field
October 10 at Elon to take on the
defending SoCon regular season
champion Pheonix.

Comparative Advantage Program helps Econ majors explore field

KELLy WILSON

Students interested in econom-
ics and career networking have a
new campus group to turn to for
support. The Comparative Advan-
tage program is affiliated with Omi-
cron Delta Epsilon, the Economics
Honor Society, and re-emerged last
year after existing on Davidson’s
campus years ago.

“The purpose of Comparative
Advantage is to provide a struc-
tured forum to enable Davidson
College students with demonstrat-
ed interest in economics to gain
insights into future career possibili-
ties through formal and informal
interaction with Davidson alumni
and friends, who will serve as their
mentors,” co-director Petri Lind-
berg °10 said. Lindberg co-directs
the program with Christoph Pross
*10 and Christie Mason °10. Dr.
Vikram Kumar, Professor of Eco-

nomics, is the advisor.

“The program seeks to improve
participants’ skill-sets with regard
to networking, interviewing, and
general professional etiquette,”
Lindberg continued. “Participants
are expected to use the program to
explore career opportunities, not to
seek future job placement.”

The program helps students
look ahead at the possibilities they
face after graduation. “Compara-
tive Advantage was a good way for
me to begin networking and under-
stand more about what opportuni-
ties there were beyond Davidson,”
said Bryant Barr *10, a program
participant.

“It opened my eyes to the possi-
bilities coming out of Davidson and
how to take advantage of them,” he
said. “My mentor was great in let-
ting me come to his office for the
day, speaking to me on a regular
basis, and helping me network in
a field I am interested in. The pro-

gram is a great way to start using
Davidson connections to help you
after you graduate.”

Lindberg cited a similar suc-
cess story. “I had a chance to meet
a partner in an investment man-
agement firm,” he said. “He was
extremely helpful in providing me
with career insight and networking
opportunities. He also invited me
to tour his office in Uptown Char-
lotte.”

Not only do students benefit
from the advice and connections a
mentor can offer, but mentors also
enjoy influencing students’ career
paths. Thomas Okel °84, Head
of Syndicated Capital Markets at
Banc of America Securities LLC,
serves as a mentor to Barr and finds
the experience gratifying.

“I have thoroughly enjoyed
getting to know the students and
watching them transition from Da-
vidson to their post-Davidson pur-
suits,” he said.

“In terms of the things I have
done with my mentees, it has var-
ied depending on what they are
pursuing,” he continued. “With
each I have spent time learning
what they are interested in, how
they have prepared and where
they need help. In getting to
know the mentee, I have shared
my career path and tried to provide
them first hand perspective on what
has worked out well and where I
have made mistakes.

“In all cases I have tried to pro-
vide contacts in the area the mentee
is pursuing. I have been able to have
the mentee spend a day or more in
my office and connect them to oth-
ers in my company as well as other
companies,” Okel said.

“Even for industries outside of
banking, I am usually able to con-
nect them with individuals in their
target industry who are willing to
