South Carolinians Plan
For Expansion Program

New Men Initiated in First Meeting
of Year—Club Has Plans
for Year

The initial meeting of the South Carolina
Club was held last week in the Eu Hall. The
meeting was in the nature of a combination
feed and initiation get-together.

President T. G. McCutcheon took charge
of the ceremonies and a committee in charge
of the initiation,headed by Bob Link. vice-
president of the club, ran the Fresh through
the neophytic stage and into full member-
ship. One of the features of the program
Was several contests staged by the men oi
the class of ’30. Much to the chagrin of
the new men, they were forced: to take rart
in stunts, all of which amused the
classmen to a hilarious extent,

After talks by the president and by a
number of members of the faecutty who-ar:
South Carolinians, the club outhned sever:
plans by which more men from the Palmetto
State may be brought to Davidsor as Fresh-
men next fall.

The members were weed to
start immediately a campaign to vet men,
who are leaders in the various branc.iws of
endeavor in high school circles, lined up ior

shown and a few probable yearlings

the college bell. The person making the
alarm will stay at the bell tower until the
arrival of the Chief Fire Marshal. He will
then take necessary steps to direct the hose
and ladder company to the scene.of the fire.

During the year 1925 the loss of property
by fire in the United States reached the im-
mense amount of $570,000,000,. Tn addition
to this great property loss thousands of lives
were sacrificed. A big fire at Davidson .Col-

lege would seriously handicap the activities

of the college, at least temporarily, and for

H. M. Austin, editor-in-chief of The
Chameleon, the Davidson College Magazine,
calls for material for the first issue to be
turned in at once. All those who intend to |
write for The Chameleon are urged to turn
in all copy immediately as the limiting date
set for the publication of the first issue is
set at October 19,

It is the desire of the staff to make the
illustrations a feature of the new magazine.
But to do this the staff needs several men
with drawing ability. Anyone who can draw
for the Magazine, and is willing to help the
staff, is urged to see H. M. Austin, in 32
Georgia, at once.

The material for The Chameleon has been
divided into three groups: short stories, es-
says, and poetry. There is a man in charge
of each department to receive the manuscript
and make necessary corrections. Contributors
to the magazine are asked to turn in the
short stories to Warren Ogden, 25 Georgia ;
essays to Don Wharton, 33° Georgia, and
poetry to J. H. Caligan, 9 Rumple.

The new journal will be a distinct inno-
It will

at Davidson in the past.

two issues will be thee only ones published

before Christmas.

be held frequently, the location of all fire -

| plugs in the town of Davidson will be learned
hyjmembers of the hose and ladder company,

and details for quickly extinguishing a fire
will be arranged. The college fire fighting
facilities combined with the facilities owned
by the town are adequate to cope with any
ordinary fire. It is expected that. the o1

a fire protection unit will afford a sense ot

ganization of the R. Jattalion into
security to property owners in Davidson and
there is a possibility that the first insurance
rates may be reduced somewhat because of
this protection.

With the hemispherical integrator the illuminating engineer measures light

intensities and distribution.

These laboratory findings are practically

applied to improve our everyday illumination.

Electric
Company is the world’s
largest manufacturer of

The General

incandescent lamps. And
behind the G-E MAZDA
lamps are vast research
laboratories dedicated
to cheaper. and better
electricillumination, and
to the conservation of

eyesight.

A series of G-E adver,
tisements showing what
electricity is doing in
many fields will be sent
on request. Ask for,
booklet GEK-1.

When the sun goes down

More than 350,000,000 incandescent lamps, with a
combined light of nine billion candlepower, make
city streets, stores, and homes brighter than ever
before.

In bungalow or mansion, workshop or factory,
dormitory or auditorium, there is no excuse for
poor illuminatidn. We have cheaper and better
lighting in the electric lamp than ever before; for
the dollar that bought 1,115 candlepower-hours of
light with the carbon-filament lamps of 1886,
now buys 16,200 candlepower-hours of light with
the MAZDA lamps.

Not only more light, but correctly applied light, is
the order of the day. The electric lamp, with its
flameless yet highly concentrated light source,
lends itself ideally to reflectors, shades, and screens.
It is controlled light—safe light. And illumina-
tion becomes an exact science.

During college days and in after life, correct light-
ing must ever be of paramount importance to the
college man and woman. Good lighting is the
worthy handmaiden of culture and progress.
