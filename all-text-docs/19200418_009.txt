BASEBALL GAME BECOMES
BATTLE OF BRAINS

Brady Beats Juniors by Brilliant
Bean Work—Big League Scouts
in Stands Looking for Material.

“You can’t beat brains” (a quota-
tion a la Friend) best describes the
contest in baseball between the Ju-
niors and Seniors last Saturday
morning.

While not a forensic exercise in
the strictest terminology, yet the
umpire was heard to make some red
utterance both before and during
the exhibition.

The batteries were Clown Cathey
and Center Brady, for the Seniors.
For the Juniors Romantic Romefelt
officiated on the mound and Wooer
Walker wore the dog muzzle.

The Juniors started off in a blaze

of glory, only to slow down as Cath- ,

ey’s conquering curves commenced
cutting capers around the corners
of the plate. When Bobby Long
couldn’t hit with the bat he used the
next most appropriate article—his
head—and knocked a home run.
Romeo forgot once that the batter
was not at second base, and the bat-
ter was shipped to first. But for
stealing Josephus takes the cake.
He sometimes tries to steal second
with all bases full, but then some-
times things don’t go well.

The star of the whole game was

DAVIDSON REGRETS DE-
PARTURE OF SGT. CARROLL
Popular R. O. T. C. Non-Com to Re-
ceive Discharge; Has Made Many
Friends Among Students.

After a little less than a year’s
service in R. O. T. C. headquarters,
Sergeant Carroll will leave David-
son next Friday. During this time
all who have come in contact with
Sergeant have learned to like him
and appreciate the work he has done
for the R.O. T.C. Sergeant Carroll
has made “Colonel” a splendid office
man and his place will be hard to

see Sergeant has always found him
ready and willing to give any infor-
mation in his power.

Sergeant Carroll leaves for his
home in Summerville, Mass., where
he expects to stay for a few weeks.
During the summer he expects to
work for the National Map Com-
pany; later he will assist his broth-
er, who is manager of several movie
concerns.

Every man in the battalion hates
to give up one who has taken as
much interest in them as Sergeant
Carroll, but every one of them
wishes him the best of luck in his
new work,

The new sergeant who comes to
take up R. O. T. C. work is W. F.
Johnson, who for two years was a
student at Davidson. “Tobe,” as he
was called by the boys, went to the
third officer's training camp, Leon
Springs, Tex., as a sergeant. He
was discharged in March, 1919, and
reinlisted at Fort Oglethorpe, April
20, 1919.

While at Davidson “Tobe” was
assistant manager of The Davidson-
‘ian and he is welcomed back on the
Hill by all the boys.

bat in the ninth with two out and
all bases full.
The spectators held their breath;
would he knock a home run—or
strike out? Finally something
seemed to happen up in his think
basket. He had evidently decided

upon the most glorious grandstand c

act. He jumped once. He jumped
twice. Would he succeed? He
jumped thrice, and got hit. This
act won the game as was afterward
seen. The game was called at the
end of the 6 2-3rd inning as every
man on the team had been hit or
otherwise incapacitated.

After all the adding machines and
stop watches on the campus had
been brought into play it was shown
that the sophisticated Seniors had
saved their sense of security to the
sound of seven-six.

LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL
TO PRESENT THREE ACT
PLAY MONDAY NIGHT

On next Monday night the David-
son High School will present, in
Shearer Hall, a very charming three
act play entitled “A Kentucky
Belle.” The play will be acted en-
tirely by local talent, with Misses
Jessamine Brown, Inez Christen-
bury, and Sarah Hamilton taking
the leading feminine parts. Four
college boys, David Lowrance, A. V.
Gibson, H. S. McCallum, and W. P.
Nesbit (“in song and story”) will
carry the leading masculine parts.
The play is under the supervision of
Mr. Miles and Mrs. A. Currie.
Thirty-five cents admission will be
charged, the money going into re-
pairs for the school building.

The plot hinges about the race of |
Kentucky Belle, a race horse, upon.
whose. success hangs the hand of
the heroine. Other sensations are a
telephone linemen’s strike, a guitar
solo, a clog dance, song by all the
actors (“My Old Kentucky Home”).
On the whole the play is a singu-
larly interesting one and is well

' Zane Grey is an angler of no
mean ability, having broken several
records in the fishing world. He is
| vice-president of the Avalon Tuna
lub and president of the Long Key
‘Fishing Club. For several years he
‘has spent the greater part of his
time on the Pacific Coast, catching
tuna, savalo, tarpon, swordfish, and
the other fighting denizens of the
deep. The story of his experiences
.is simply and graphically told in the
“Tales of Fishes” which has been
off the press for only a few months.
Let any one who believes that a

hour fight for a broadbill swordfish.
The reader's interest is held unceas-
ingly from the time the magnificent

The book is rendered doubly in-

and hung up for the admiring
throng.

“Soft I sit in dreaming,

As oft Iam wont to do.

Of songs and girls and women

But most of all of you.

“Of your eyes so bright and blue
Always dancing, laughing thru
I wonder if they are as true
As they are gay and blithe and

“Then your smiling still conspiring
With those eyes so blue and ga
To charm and hold by their beguil-

ing
’Till they steal my heart away.
“Happy pris’ner thus to be
Sately charmed and hid away;
Keep it captivity, lose the key
And tell my heart that it may
stay.”—Ex

greatly missed.
