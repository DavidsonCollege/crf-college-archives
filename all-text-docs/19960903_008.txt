OPINIONS

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1996

Crates, books, sheets, suit-
cases and goodbyes all have one
thing incommon—they are among
the essentials the class of 2000
brought to Davidson last Thurs-
day. Aside from our tangible pos-
sessions, we also brought minds
open to the ways and ideals one
might be accustomed to in college.
In short, the freshman send rave
reviews about college life from
Davidson’s unique Honor Code to
the off-the-wall mixers with other
halls. So, we would like the chance
to give everyone else a trip down
memory lane by remembering our
first impressions of life here at
Davidson.

Reading about the Honor Code
from brochures and the applica-
tion: gave us a very one-dimen-
sional understanding of its full

Iamreally nota pessimist. On
a good day, my glass is usually half
full, the grass is pretty green in my
own backyard, and there is most
certainly a light at the end of my
tunnel. But as I grapple with the
recent tragedies Americans face
today, first the senseless downing
of TWA flight 800 and the equally
disturbing Olympic Park bomb-
ing, my glass seems awfully empty,
weeds are attacking my lawn, and
the bulb just burned out andI can’t
see a thing.

Iam discouraged. And ticked
off and angry and afraid. As a
young person with one more year
of college and imminent freedom
pacing at my doorstep, I feel no
more excitement for pending lib-
eration than a roast pig ona platter.
After narrowly escaping the Cen-
tennial Olympic Park bombing in

Atlanta this summer by ashorthalf -

hour, my once solid foundation of
moral faith in our country was sud-
denly uprooted and replaced by
uncertainty and fear. With these

Ilove the Honor Code. Ithelps
foster a trusting atmosphere that
not only breeds closer ties in the
college communtiy but propagates
personal responsibility and per-
sonal accountability.

But there is a part of it that
doesn’t sit well with me. It didn’t
two years ago when I wrote my
application to Davidson, and it
doesn’t now. Page two in the stu-
dent handbook reads: “Every stu-
dent shall be honor bound to report
immediately all violations of the
Honor Code which come under his
observation; failure to do so will
be a violation of the Honor Code.”
Or, as [understand it, itis an Honor
Code violation not to immediately
report suspicion of another peer’s
transgressions to the Dean of Stu-
dents.

Davidson’s Honor
Code truly impresses us. It creates
an atmosphere on campus unlike
any other college. Here, students
are given freedom because hon-
esty and responsibility constitute
an integral part of daily life. Thank
you to upperclassmen and alumni
who have loved their school enough
to keep such a tradition alive. We
pledge to uphold our part of the
bargain.

not-so-distant tragedies, namely
the World Trade Center bombing,
the Oklahoma City bombing, and
the ValuJet crash, I am desperately
searching for a foothold of hope in

now. Not 24 hours of the academic
year had passed before the fresh-
man class had joined the ranks of
study-carel dwellers.

When we are not beating our
heads against the sides of our fa-
vorite carel, you can find a fresh-

“freshman 15” with plenty of fries
and blueberry cheesecake ice
cream, Vail provides us with a
perfect way to bond with our
hallmates while observing their
obscure eating habits.

Yet our mostentertaining, and
at times our most revealing, mo-
ments have been our beloved hall
activities and mixers.

On Tuesday night, we had the
privilege of giving the boys of base-

us ample time to gain our .

‘ment Belk a much-needed

makeover with various flavors of
cake/shaving cream masques. We
believed our artwork on the boys
to be quite an improvement. Un-
fortunately, they did not agree, and
retaliated with tubs of water and
fistfuls of cake. In the future, we
hope they will mind their manners;
women of the 90s demand their
respect. .

All in all, our first week has
given us a preview of our next as
we begin to bushwhack through
the college jungle. One of the many
things we are greatly anticipating
is the good old-fashioned fun dur-
ing our “First Night Down!”

Yet until September 20, we
will continue to make our cos-
metic rounds to the other boys’
dorms.

glish language cannot do service

me as I read the Saturday morning

Constitution, “Park Explosion,”

I choose the word “‘peer” here
deliberately. We are all students of
Davidson College. We all play,
work, eat, celebrate, and live here
together, and we have a responsi-
bility toeach other that comes from
being a part of this communtiy.
When we are forced, under threats
of our own suspension, to immedi-
ately report violations of the Honor
Code to the Dean of Students of-
fice, we do each other a disservice.
Before we run to the administra-
tion, we have a duty to approach
our peer and confront him/her with
the suspected violation. ©

the Honor Code, I made a pact with
my classmates and the students
who had come before me to do as
wellas I could in life without break-
‘ing the rules. In signing, I asked

Generation X and “as American as

ise, and promised to help uphold
theirs. Are we helping anyone when
we turn our back on a violation,
and report it to the administration
instead of confronting the violator
with his/her own broken pact? I
don’t think so. Besides, my prom-
ise was personal, but there is noth-

‘ing personal about anonymously
pointing fingers at faces behind
closed doors.

The Honor Code,. as it now
stands, cuts against the most pre-
cious aspect of this college, our
faith in each other. My allegiance
is not to these buildings, the
grounds, or even the ghosts of past
students, but rather to the people
who walk these grounds every day.

campus a vivacious entity, and

Davidson College student.

And maybe I’ m too idealistic.
Maybe I have too much faith that
other students would be willing to
approach a peer and ask if he/her
was cheating. I have a friend who

‘thinks I do. She says that forcing
people into confrontational situa-

tions will keep students from re-
porting each other and slowly eat
away at the code itself. Maybe
she’s right. I don’t know.

But what I do know is if I
walked into the bathroom during
finals and found this guy reading a
page of notes over the sink, I would

want to feel safe in our country

Maybe I have been living ina
fog so far, but until lately the United
States of America has yet to rain
too terribly on my parade.

Franklin D. Roosevelt once
said: “We look forward to a world
founded upon four essential hu-
man freedoms. The first is free-
dom of speech and expression —
everywhere in the world. The sec-
ond is freedom of every person to
worship God in his own way —
everywhere in the world. The third
is freedom from want...The fourth
is freedom from fear.”

look forward as well. Fill up
my glass.

The Honor Code’s personal binds

those notes are sitting before him,
even if that’s the more difficult
course of action. At least then I
would feel better about what I had
done.

Part of the reason many of us
come to Davidson College is the
Honor Code which we hand down
to each other and protect through
the years as students. But, it is time
now to re-evaluate what the Honor
Code is and should be about. I
believe it should be a personal pact
made by the students, to the stu-
dents, and for the students. For that
to truly happen then the students
must take the responsibility to con-
front each other when a violation is
suspected, turning to the Dean of
Students office only as a recourse
if the confrontation fails.
