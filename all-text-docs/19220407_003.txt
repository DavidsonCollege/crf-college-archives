THE

DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 7, 1922.

THE LITTLE MINISTER.

Betty Compson, dainty Paramount star
whose first stellar vehicle, “At the End
of the World,” created a profound im-
pression here some weeks ago, has scor-
ed again. Her newest Paramount pic-
ture, “The Little Minister,” in which she
is seen as Lady Babbie, was shown with
exceptional success at the movies last
Saturday night. She vested the Babbie
of Sir James M. Barrie’s creation with a
fervor and winsomeness that caught the
spectators instantly. There are many
thrilling moments in the action and these¥
tend to make the presentation extreme-
ly enjoyable.

BELMONT DELEGATES NAMED
AT LOCAL C. E. MEETING

The local Christian Endeavor Society
held an interesting meeting in the
Church last Sunday. The leader, W. C.
Ramsey, made'a short talk on “Bible
Reading,” bringing out the fact that

read the Bible. The amount to be read,
he said, should be decided by the read-
cr’s mood and time. Sometimes it is best
that we read only a few verses, study
and meditate over them; then put their
tcachings into practice.

of tRe society gave one-minute talks on
why and how they were reading their

| Bibles.

At the close of the meeting the dele-
gates to the coming Christian Endeav-
cor Convention, to be held in Belmont
April 7th and 8th, were elected. Wallace
Purdy, Miss Frances Johnson and Miss
Nina Holt White were chosen to repre-
sent the local society.

DR. J. M. WELLS SPEAKS.

(Continued from page 1)

| Philip, saying, arise and go, and he arose

and went.”

Doctor Wells then showed the ditfer-
ent ways by which God makes known
His will to us. First by His Word as
revealed in the scriptures, then by spe-
cial providences, events which point out
to us the path God wishes us to take,
then by the inner voice, conscience, or
the Holy Spirit within us.

But just as we obey God's voice when
He tells us to come, in the same way
we must obey Him when He says to us:
“Go.” It may not be perfectly clear
what God’s will in the matter is, but if
we obey His confmand instantly and wil-
lingly our vision will grow broader and
it will be revealed to us what He wishes
of us.

The greatest call of all, though, is the
call of God: “Go and win souls.”

After the talk by Doctor Wells there
followed a short discussion of several
matters of interest. The meeting was
closed by a song, followed hv @ prayer
by Doctor Wells.

Volunteer Band.

Doctor Wells, president of Columbia
Seminary, in speaking to the Voluutecr
Band Sunday morning brought out the
fact that the plain man and w@man have
taken their place in the world along with
those who are especially gifted. ‘As an
illustration he told of three of his col-
lege mates who were only everyday
men now standing out as leaders in their
work. These men while in college were
elected by their student body to go to
Student Volunteer Convention and came
back with a zeal and determination to do
a greater work for others.

Two of these men went to Korea as
missionaries, one, Doctor Reynolds,
translated the Bible into the Korean
language and will go down in Church his-
tcry as one of its greatest men. The
second, Doctor Bell, is one of the most
noted evangelists in Korea, and the. peo-
ple he has converted are not only nomi-
nal Christians but in time of persecu-
tion stick to their new faith better than
the Christians. of this land.

The third college mate is doing a great
work in the United States and is an-
other good example of the everyday man
taking no small part in the runnings of
this old world. “These three were plain
everyday men like us, but aspired to
great things and stuck to it.”

| THE CALL TO THE MINISTRY.
| —— |
| An elderly woman now living in the)
west, formerly a resident of Princeton,
|New Jersey, not long ago visited’ her
lrelatives in that town. She was espe-
, cially interested in the progress of a
nephew who had entered the ministry.

early in the morning is the best time to} She had not seen him since his boyhood,

'and was, therefore, anxious to attend
service at his church,

At dinner, subsequent to the Sunday
jsermons she heard delivered by her
jnephew, it was observed that the old
|woman was singularly reticent.

; Suddenly she borke her long silence
jby asking her nephew, “William, why
did you enter the ministry?”

| “Why, aunt!’ exclaimed the young
fdivine. “What a question! I entered
the ministry because I was called.”

Just a suspicion of a smile came to the
lold woman's face, she responded,
i*Are you sure, William, that it wasn’t
some other noise you heard?”

DAVIDSON HIGH SCHOOL IS

| In a loosely played game on Sprunt
| Field, Saturday, the Wildkittens trounced
jthe Davidson Highs to the tune of 15 to|
}3. The coaching of Currie for the Highs
was very evident, and they showed up
jwell, considering the short time they
jhad been practicing, The game furnish- |
jed many thrills, among them the piteh-|
jing of Currie, and the hitting of the|
| Wildkittens, © The were equally |
distributed. |
| The Kittens realized that they had a
hard fight on, when Coach Currie
the mound and Allen, the receiving end
for the High, for many Kittens returned |
to thejr den, without even
hall. The umpiring end of the game was
equally as hard to hold, in the face of,
the critical spectators, and before long;
Howell was substituted for Meladden. |
{The Highs are hoping for another game
with the Wildkittens in order that they |
|may get revenge for this defeat. Anthony
