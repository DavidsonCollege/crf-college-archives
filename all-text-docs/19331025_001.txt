HOUSE PARTIES GIVEN

Many Girls Entertained by Social
Fraternities Over Week-end

Davidson’s annual Home - coming
dances, including a set of two dances,
was held last week-end at the Hotel
Charlotte ballroom, and proved to be
an unusually successful affair, All ten
of the social fraternities on the campus
held house parties in connection with
the dances. :

Music for the set of dances, which
included a formal dance Friday night
and an informal one Saturday night,
was furnished by Nick Laney and his
Blue Devils. Due to training rules,
Nick Laney, the crooning halfback,
was unable to render the vocal sclec-
tions. Miss Eleanor Bell, of Charlotte,
Was guest-soloist for the orchestra.
Several members of the band put on
some very interesting novelty numbers,

The dances were under the sponsor-
ship of the Davidson Pan-Hellenic
Council, They had charge of the con-
duct on the floor. The following mem-
bers of the Davidson faculty acted as
chaperons: Professor and Mrs. Gol-
diere, Professor and Mrs. Wood, Dr.
and Mrs. Hood, Major and Mrs. Rhett,
and Dr. and Mrs. Lyon.

Many alumni returned fot this set
of dances. A large number of students
with their dates attended the social
function of the Home-coming week-
end.

The list of girls that came up for
the Home-coming festivities follows:

Beta Theta Pi: Elinor Stone, Boston,
Mass.; Kitty Kiker Reidsville; Eleanor
Bell, Charlotte; Virginia Carey, Char-

State Game Will Be
Shown on Grid-Graph

Play-by-Play Report Will Start
With Contest

The Davidson-N. C. State football
game, which is to be played in Raleigh
this Saturday afternoon, will be pre-
sented in a play-by-play report on the
Grid-Graph in Shearer Hall, for the
benefit of Davidson students, alumni,
and townspeople who will be unable
to attend the game.

A leased wire will bring each play
from Raleigh to Shearer Hall, where
it will be re-acted on the board, just
a few seconds after being executed on
the field. A small admittance fee will
be made to help defray part of the
expense of the wire,

The progress of the ball is indicated
on a miniature playing field on the
Grid-Graph by a light. The kind of
play, who handled the ball, who made

the tackle, and where the play went

is shown by flashing light.
The report will begin at start of the
game.

Organ Recital Given
By Musical Leader

Professor James Christian Pfohl, di-
rector of music, gave the first concert
of a series of organ recitals on Thurs-
day evening, October 19, 1933, at eight
o'clock in the Chambers Auditorium.

Professor Pfohl played as his first
number Handel’s appealing “Largo”
(Xerxes). His second one was the
‘Prelude” by Clerambault. The next
rendition was the famous German
choral, the Symphonie Choral, “Ach,
Bleib Mit Deiner Gnade,” by Karl-
Elert. It was followed by the “ Vision”
Hy Rheinberger and the “Londonderry
Air,” a traditional Irish number. The
most outstanding number of the con-
cert was the difficult “Prelude and
Fugue in D Major” by Bach.

The entire performance was given
by memory and lasted only a half-
hour. It was well attended by the
students, residents of Davidson, and
visitors from the neighboring towns.

Morris Wires

A telegram from Joe “Shrimp”
Morris, Davidson football and
baseball star who was stricken
with paralysis while playing
baseball at Edenton early this
summer, brought cheers from the
student body when it was read
before the start of the Duke-Da-
vidson game Saturday.

Morris, who was to captain the
diamond team this spring and to
be a vice-president of the Ath-
letic Association, is in bed at his
home in Hattiesburg, Miss.

The message, which was ad-
dressed to Charlie Rives, captain
of the Wildcat team, is as fol-
lows:

“Heart and best wishes with
you. Pulling for you to come
through. Shrimp Morris.”

Dr. Richards Talks

at Vesper Service

Self-Respect is Theme of Address
by Columbia Theological
Seminary President

Dr. J. McDowell Richards, president
of Columbia Theological Seminary, a
graduate of Davidson college, and son
of Dr. C. M. Richards of the Bible de-
partment, spoke to a large student con-
gregation at the vesper hour last Sun-
day evening on the subject, “The
Beauty of Self-Respect.” Robert Wood-
side, of the Senior class, was in charge
of the service. He called on Lynn Huie
and Rufus Morrow to lead the group
in prayer. The College Quartet, con-
sisting of Dave McLain, Hubert Mor-
ris, Buddy Robinson and Frank Tuck-
er, accompanied by A. D. Wauchope,
sang “ Jehovah, Us by Thy
Hand” as the special musical number.
At the organ, Mr. Wauchope played
for the prelude, “Largo,” from “The
New World Syinphon,y.”

Dr. Richards took as his text the
eighteenth verse of the nineteenth
chapter of Levitieus, “Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself.” He remarked
that the emphasis is usually placed on
the first part of this verse. However,
he called attention to the qualification
which the phrase “as thyself” bears to
love for others. It takes for granted
that self-respect not only exists, but
is essential for one’s own good as well
as the good of one’s neighbors. Man
must have belief in the potentialities
within himself to appreciate the worth
in others,

Self-respect is wholly different from
selfishness, Ivar Kreuger, who tow-
ered the financial markets of
Europe, was an utterly selfish individ-
ual who craved power and wealth at
the expense of honor. He knew noth-
ing of self-respect. His death was even
that of a selfish soul—suicide, Again,
self-respect differs from conceit. Tt is
the man who can see God's gifts to
him as talents placed in his hands by
his Master to be developed that has
appreciated them properly.

Dr. Richards divided. his discussion

“Self-Respect” into three ‘parts.
Under the first heading, he told of self-
respect for the body. He reminded his
hearers of the admiration generally ac-
corded a great machine, and of the
extreme care taken of it. The body,
likewise, should receive the same sort
of care. One should be careful as to
habits, temperate in all things, and reg-
ular in exercise. Secondly, self-respect
for the mind is*the only logical atti-
tude one can take towards his mind
when he realizes that it is man’s mind
that has giver him dominion over na-
ture, and not. his body alone. It has
filled the heavens with airships, tun-
nelled mountains, and measured stars.
“Thinking,” said “Dr. Richards, “is per-
haps the hardest work we have to do,
and is probably one reason why we do
so little of it.” But above all these is
self-respect for the soul. This is an
age that believes in the development
of the body and mind, but not the

Large Homecoming Crowd

Dr. Edwin Mims to
Speak Here Oct. 27

“Lost. Leaders and Happy War-
© riors” Will Be Subject of
Lecture

The faculty committee on public lec-
tures has been extremely fortunate in
securing Dr. Edwin Mims of Vander-
bilt University to speak in the Cham-
bers Auditorium on Friday, October
27. His subject will be “Lost Leaders
and Happy Warriors.”

Dr. Mims, who has been the head
of the English department of Vander-
bilt University since 1912, has a well-
known reputation as a brilliant lec-
turer and English scholar. For a num-
ber of summers he lectured on a
Chautauqua circuit. Among the uni-
versities and colleges at which he has
spoken is the University of Southern
California,

It is hoped that many of the people
of Davidson and of neighboring towns
and cities will be interested in attend-
ing this lecture. And it is certain that
all heard Dr. Mims’ interesting
and unique lecture on “Bright Inter-
vals” in 1932 will verify the foregoing
statements regarding the excellent
quality of Dr. Mims as a lecturer.

Pfohl has improved by his efforts in

Freshman Campused
by Court of Control

Halverstadt Announces Decision
Over Twenty-four New
Men

The Court of Control held its first
trial Wednesday, October 18, especially
for the conviction of twenty-four fresh-
men who “cut” the pep meeting be-
fore the Davidson-V. M. I. game.
These—the “check-up” at the pep
meeting and the resulting Court of
Control action—are the first definite
moves toward the discipline of fresh-
men that have been made this year.

Because so many freshmen have not
been attending pep meetings, Hugh
Hawkins, varsity cheerleader, had all
the freshmen who were present at the
meeting in question sign their names
on his lists. Those first-year men who
did not sign their names were reported
to the Court of Control.

Good Games

With the odds against them, and bat-

which recently whipped the unbeat-
able Tennessee Vols, Davidson's bat-
tered but ever-game Wildcats lived up
to their reputation when they held
their bigger opponents to a 19 to 7
score on Richardson Field last Satur-
day.

Coach Wallace Wade was forced to
rush in his first-string men on several
occasions when sharp thrusts by Da-
vidson took the Duke second team for
everything they had. Obviously Wade
was saving his first-stringers for the
important Kentucky game next Sat-
urday, which will have some little
bearing on whethér Duke goes to the
Rose Bowl or not.

Most of the time the Devil second
team was on the field it was outplayed
by the Wildeats,, who twice advanced
the ball inside the Duke five-yard line

Soon after the beginning of the

afterward the game ended with the
