volunteered as a health worker in Paraguay,
and participated in the reverse mission trip to
El Salvador. She believes that simply living
in the international setting provides “a real
opportunity for growth.”

Future Plans

Beyond studying abroad next year,
Ogden plans to attend divinity school with
the goal of ordination and perhaps further
pursuing a Ph.D. in religion to enlist in the
ranks of academicians. She says she seeks to
integrate “the ideas of great thinkers and
actions of, great leaders into the concrete
experience” of her life.

Ortmayer said of the scholarship selec-
tion committee’s choice, “We look for a self-
confident, self-sufficient person who’s really
going to make the best of this opportunity.
She ‘is very articulate, very intelligent, re-
sourceful, and.confident.”

Because the Smith Scholarship is the
“flagship scholarship for this institution cre-
ated by an alumnus,” as Ortmayer put it,
someone who will maximize use of the schol-
arship is essential. The Smith scholars, “will
help recruit and define that scholarship for
students who follow them,” said Ortmayer.

Tom Smith, the scholarship’s benefac-
tor, is a lifetime member of the Board of
Visitors, recipient of a Davidson Alumni
Service Award, and director of the John I.
Smith Charities, a family foundation.
