Tourney - Troubled Cats Try Again

BILL BRIGGS
Sports Editor

A DIFFERENT STORY?

_ “Psychologically we're in better shape than ever
before—whatever that’s worth.” Coach Lefty Driesell
reflected Tuesday before the tournament began.

“Being in good phychological condition may not
win a tournameat, but it sure helps.”

Yesterday afternoon, helped or not by their psy-
chological condition, a cool but scrappy Wildcat bas-
ketball team completely wiped the floor of Char-
lotte’s domed coliseum with the nauseating robins-

THE DAVIDSONIAN

For the third straight year the Southern Con-
ference Tournament is being held in Charlotte.

For the third straight year Davidson, led by the
top player in the Southern Conference, is the. pre-
tourney favorite.

For two straight years Davidson has lost in the
semi-finals . . . will this be the third?

There are some differences this year. Most nota-
bly Driesell has lugged his chargers into Ciarlotte to
spend the three day tournament in the Coliseum Mo-
tor Court, away from bodks, classes, and loud dor-
mitories.

“The best we've ever done in the tournament
was three years ago in Richmond,” Driesell remi-
nisced. “The tournament was sort of a break for
the boys. For the past two years we've been coming
back to classes, that might have affected our play.”

For the first time in three years Driesell is un-
ranked nationally, but he looks upon this with a near
“Pollyanna-ish” philosophy, “We won't have the
pressure of being in the top ten this year. We won't
be overconfident.”

All this helps to add up to the third big differ-
ence between this and the past two years — what
Driesell meant by better psychological shape.

Besides the pleasant atmosphere of a Charlotte
motel and lack of pressure that national ranking
gives, Driesell lists one other factor in his pre-tour-

“These sophomores this year have heard about
the other good players we’ve had who didn’t win the
tournament. This should give this year’s boys incen-
tive to try to do something that Hetzel, Davidson,
Teague and those boys couldn’t do.”

MAYBE THIS YEAR

This could be the year for Driesell to lead David-
son’s cagers over the visible foes that must haunt
him — Richmond, West Virginia, William and Mary.
But just as vital, if the 'Cats are ‘to take home the
trophy. we must beat an invisible enemy.

We must somehow conquer ourselves or again
we will find our post-tournament solace by tears and
curses. I have grown tired of this reward.

_ We must—as a team—conquer our fear to show
spirit, to shake with eager anticipation as the Coli-
seum’s spotlight underlines the opening introduc-
tions, to jump off the bench or scream praise from
the floor at a good play and to rip down victory nets.

But to conquer ourselves as a team we must also
conquer ourselves as students. For at least two more
tournament games, I hope, we must drop our shallow
facade of coolness. We miust learn to drink deeply
of the wine of victory if we ever hope to really taste
it.

So we must shout ourselves hoarse, show spirit
enough to let a small group of players know we have
given ourselves to them, so they will give themselves
in turn to us.

PAGE FIVE

We must yeturn to a past day, before Davidson,
where it was no crime to show emotions and no
damning fingers pointed at the joy you took with
winning.

_ We must recapture what we have lost or we will
again need to worry about the unfairness of our
scapegoat. the tournament. We will again be REG-
ULAR SEASON champions.

We must recapture what we have lost, so late to-
morrow -night we can pour onto the floor to carry
plavers to the nets—not sneak under the stands to
spit at imaginary villains.

Citadel

Davidson's Wildcats finished
out the regular season with a
77-64 conference victory against
The Citadel last Friday on the
Charleston hardwoods.

Captain Dick Snyder led the
‘Cats by scoring 26 points.

The game was hard-fought,
but late in the second half, trail-

ing by several points, the Bull- ;

dogs went into a full court press.
The fast-moving ‘Cats were then
able to add to the lead by sev-
eral consecutive fast breaks.

After the game Coach Lefty
Driesell had this to say: ‘‘The
boys played well tonight and
we're ready for the tournament.
I am very pleased with the play
of the-team and this year we
will win the conference tourncy
as well as the regular season.”

Davidson finished the season
with an 17-5 overall record, 11-1
in the conference.

Freshman Status Clarified
By New IMAC Proposal

The IMAC has proposed several changes in freshman intramural participation

channels whereby to eliminate the con-

fusion caused by previous non-action. The recommended action will take place im-
mediately upon the completion of the IMAC basketball schedule.

The main point in the IMAC
proposal is that ‘freshmen be
allowed to participate in the in-
tramural program as fraternity

posal be made for next year.

In recent action one of the big
games of the year was the stun-
ning upset victory by the SAE's

and out.

Davidson hurdled the first
obstacle to its quest for the
elusive Southern Confer-
ence crown by submerging
Thé Citadel in a flood of sec-
ond-half points yesterday
afternoon, 79-61.

By the game’s end evety-
one joined in the fun, but
not before the Bulldogs’ de-
liberate style had the pa-

- trons squirming in their
{ seats.

The final score belies the
closeness of the contest: in jts
opening stages, when both teams
were as chilly in the first half
as the. weather outside. Over
two minutes had slipped away
when -Bobby -Lane popped from
the outside and relieved any
worry about a scorcless: duel.

In the midst of sporadic scor-
ing by the Bulldogs. Dick Sny-
der reeled off eight points to
send the Wildcats out in front.
However, both teams seemed to
agree to giving the official scor-
er a breather because they spent
the rest of the half adjusting
their sights.

As the half drew to a close the
crowd wondered if the ‘Cats
were poing to be wrapped up in
the cocoon spun by the. slow
moving Bulldogs, but Davidson

-broke gait and sprinted to seven

straight points and a 29-19 mar
gin at intermission. The Citadel
had been badly hampered by 27
per cent shooting.

The second half revealed a
complete reversal of form. Un-
able to maintain their control
game, the Bulldogs joined in the
fast-breaking game but came
out second best. Brilliant shoot-
ing by Snyder and Lane mar-
shalled the torrent of points to
the final 18-point spread. At one
stage the margin reached the
26-point level, but subsided as
Coach Lefty Driesell allotted
ample playing time to the re-
serves.

This vear, for the third season
in a row, Davidson entered the
tournament as the number one
team, but in the previous two
seasons the unfortunate ‘Cats
saw their national aspirations
ground into the dust of defeat.

However, led in every phase
by the superb Dick Snyder. these
sophomores ‘and Phil. Squier. a
senior starting for the first time,
fashioned a 17-5 regular season -
log. They had matured enough .
during the season for Driesell to
stép out of character early in
the week and admit publicly that
they had a fine shot at the tour
nament crown.

But in ‘the Southern Confer

[crence in the nation. season rec-
ords are tossed: out the window
and eight teams indulge in a
three day backstroke brawl. It is
from this family: squabble. that
Davidson has yet to emerge as
“king of the mountain,” This 45
Where ‘their hearts have been
broken and this is where a new
band rises to make amends.

To do so. the ‘Cats must face
two more foes. Tonight Rich
mond pits the charm of fourth
seed. against Driesell's legions,
hoping to carn their own way
into the final night's action. For
the past two. years the fourth
seeded team has copped the title
alter whipping the ’Cats in the
semifinals. °

In yesterday's action the Spi-
ders nipped ECC on a shot by
Tom Green with :03 left in the
contest. In qualifying for the
semi-finals Richmond scorched
the Coliseum cords for a tourna-
ment record 65.6 per cent. A
pair of guards, Spike Welsh and
All-Conference Johnriy Moates,
will team with Green to contest
tonight’s issue.

Should Davidson vault into the
finals they will meet either West.
