Mecklenburg Presbytery To
Oppose Dancing In Any Form

Dr. Edgar Gammon Proposes
Matter Be Left Entirely

To Trustees
ATLANTA ALUMNI FAVOR

Dr. Black States Dancing Is
, Slime Pit Of This Age

The Mecklenburg Presbytery went on
record as being “unalterably opposed to
dancing at Davidson College or else-
where under sponsorship of Davidson
organizations” in its semi-annual meet-
ing held at the Central Steele Creek
Church last week.

This question of dancing on the David-
son campus received a great deal of dis-
cussion and brought to the surface more
conflicting opinions than almost any
other subject considered by the Presby-
tery.

Previous to this, Presbyteries—King’s
Mountain and Orange—had declared
themselves opposed to dancing at David-
son, and the Alumni Chapter at At-
lanta, more closely connected with the
college itself, expressed themselves as
“in favor of dancing on the Davidson
campus.”

This subject was discussed by the
Presbyteries as the result of requests
by Dr. C. R. Nisbet, chairman of the
committee appointed by the trustees to
report on the question, This action of
the trustees was due to a petition sub-
mitted to them by the Student Policies
Union ih February. The. query is being
placed before all Presbyteries sponsor-
ing the coliege.

The Mecklenburg Presbytery consid-
ered Dr, Nisbet's request on last Wednes-
day.. In addition to goifg on record
against dancing, the Presbytery re-
quested the trustees of the college to re-
fuse students permission to hold dances
on the campus and also to bar Davidson
students from holding dances in Char-
lotte.

The Presbytery decided to take this
view because Davidson “is a church con-
trolled institution, and to allow dancing
at the college would be to contradict
the well-known position of the General
Assembly—-on—the—subject,” stated The
Charlotte Observer.

The decision was reached, however,
only after a spirited discussion which
showed a surprising number of church-
men whose views on the subject refused
to conform with those of the General

Assembly.
The discussion began when Dr. Edgar
Gammon, head of the committee on

schools and colleges and pastor of the
Myers Park Presbyterian church rec-
ommended that the matter be left en-
tirely with the board of trustees,
Opposition to this was made manifest
immediately when Rey. J. C. Grier of
Mulberry rose and offered a substitute.
His report, drastically opposed to Dr.
Gammon’s recommendation read: “Inas-
much as Davidson College is a Christian
College under. the control of member-
ship of the Présbyterian church and in-
asmuch as the General Assembly has
from time to time sent down a deliver-

Dr. Lingle Speaks On Graham
Memorial Fund And Objec-
tives Of A Christian College

Dr. W. L. Lingle, president of Davio-
son College, made two addresses last
week—one to the Charlotte Chamber of
Commerce on Wednesday night and one
on Thursday night to an assembly of
the Associate Reformed Presbyterian
Church in Due West, S. C.

Dr. Lingle appeared as one of four
speakers on the program before the
Chamber of Commerce. The others
were Mr. Grisette of U. N. C., former
Senator Cameron Morrison, and Mayor
Wearn of Charlotte. The main reason
for the meeting was to consider a me-
morial for Dr. Alexander Graham,
father of the grade school system in
Charlotte and a leading educator of the
state.

There were approximately one hun-
dred citizens present who proposed as a
memorial to Dr. Graham a ten thou-
sand dollar loan fund for the purpose of
enabling Charlotte boys and girls to at-
tend North Carolina institutions
higher education.

Dr. Lingle spoke of his personal ac-
quaintance with, and his admiration of
Dr. Graham, He said that this memo-
rial would be very appropriate, since
Dr. Graham had spent his life in the
education of Charlotte boys and girls,
many of whom are now middle aged
men and women, Dr, Lingle pointed
out the great need of such a fund, and
how it would give many boys and girls
chances that otherwise they would not
have.

Committees will be appointed to raise
this money and also to raise a few more
dollars to put a bronze tablet te -Dr.
Graham on Alexander Graham Junior
High School.

On Thursday night the 13lst session
of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian
church, meeting at Erskine College, Due
West, S..C., was brought to a close by an
address by Dr. Lingle. He spoke on
“Objectives of a Christian College.” Dr.
Lingle said that although he was able
to attend three great college associations
each year, the Southern Association of

EDDY APPEARS
IN CHARLOTTE

Star Of “Naughty Marietta” Fav-
ors Jazz; Bothered By Fem-
inine Sex In Pictures

(INTERVIEWED BY RIcHARD VowLeEs)

With his rich baritone voice, Nelson
Eddy, of recent screen fame due to his
picture “Naughty Marietta,” held a
packed spellbound at Elizabeth
School, Charlotte, last Friday night.

In the first half of the program, Nel-
son Eddy presented two groups, one in
Italian and one in French. In “Au Pays”
or “The Soldier's Return,” he brought
out his theory, which he later expressed
in the interview, that facial expression
or dramatization is a necessary asset to
vocal interpretation.

Back stage after his last encore,
“Dusty Road” just out from Hollywood,
the world famous baritone expressed his
opinions to this reporter.

house

“How did you like working on
“Naughty Marietta?”
“It was swell—orte of the greatest

experiences that I have ever had.”
After combing his blond curly hair at
the "dressing room mirror, he lounged
back in an armchair prepared to be an-
noyed, The baritone was literally a
hlond giant with powerful handsome fea-
tures—not the cold unapproachable mu-
sician, but the friendly man, desiring
to put the inquiring reporter at his ease.
“How does your radio work compare
with your moving picture work?”
“Oh, there’s no use trying to make
a comparison. For that matter, there
isn’t any—they’re so utterly different.”
“I noticed that you used a good deal
of facial interpretation with a. striking
degree of success. Do you think. this
means of “putting over’ a number en-
hances or cheapens the performance?”
“Facial expression decidedly enhances
a performance. ‘This is just as in con-
versation. When TI talk, I express my-
self as much by my face as by my
words, and so it should be with sing-
ing.”
“What are the chances for a student
