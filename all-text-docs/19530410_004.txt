Music Educators National Associa-
tion.

The members of the quintet,

net, David Gordon, horn, and A. K.
Garrison, bassoon, have long been
in preparation for the event.

can composer, Roger Gaeb.

Library Receives
Renaissance Books .

In keeping with the theme of
this Spring’s Fine Arts Week,
which is to emphasize the Renais-
sance, the College Library has
received six books from the Li-
brary of the University of North
Carolina, which should prove of
interest to antiquarians as well as
students of Church History:

The display in the central alcove
of the library will feature two
Estiennes, a latin Bible, published
in 1655, and Clavin’s Commentaries,
published in 1556, a first edition
covering the general epistles.

In addition, two Aldines, Cicero’s
Epistles (1521) and Caesar’s Com-
mentaries, (1547) will be shown,
the latter containing some interest-
ing block prints as illustrations.
Another copy of Cicero's Epistles
(1642) and Cunaei De Republica
(1632) are of a later date, but are
indicative of the era, will complete
the exhibition.

for Joe — on me.” The light on
the machine glimmered and almost
went out.

“What's this string for?” I asked
the machine's companion.

“Those are Joe’s wigs. When he
wants to be one of the boys, he
puts on the fairly touseled one, and
whenever he wants to appear aloof
and superior, he wears the slicked-
down hair.” In this compartment
are all of his accessories. Lately
Joe has been hiring out to college
students running for offices. Here
is a pipe so he can be College Joe
— Clever, eh? This Bible is to im-
press the holy boys and this church-
key — he uses it when he is one
of the gang. These glasses he uses
to influence professors — incident-
ly, he does translate Latin rather
well; he wears this D-sweater when-
ever he is around athletes.”

“Max, get Joe a Scotch on the
rocks, will Ya?" I spoke to the
bartender.

“No, no! Thanks, but Joe and
I must be going before he passes
out. He’s done enough celebrat-
ing already.”

The machine fell over on its
friend and a long sheet of paper
slipped out from the top, just un-
der the now extinguished light.
It was a roster of the names of all
the students from some college,
with the first names underlined.
The stranger stuffed it back into
the machine, as he put one of its
“arms” around his own shoulder
and payed the bill. “That’s a list
of all the names from some boys’
school where Joe is working next.
You have to call people by their
names to win, you know,” he ex-
plained.

“The man half carried, half drag-

ged Joe toward the door. “Wait
a minute!” I cried, “A bolt has
fallen out of his back-slapping
arm.” .
“Oh no”, laughed the stranger,
“At Joe’s next job, in order to be
popular, one must have given blood
to a blood drive.” He pulled Joe
on out and dumped him into the
blue cadillac sitting in front.
“Guess who'll win the next elec-
tion,” I heard him call back as he
headed north from Charlotte.

Dorm Council...
(Continued From Page One)

- Al Capp would have no trouble

finding a suitable name for this
weeks senior, for “Lovable Jervy’
is a natural. This cuddly male takes
great delight in upsetting the
quoted facts and figures of the N.
Y. World Telegram Almanac of
1953: “. . . in the central coastal
states of the south this ratio drops
to 2% males for every female.”
There must be at least 3 boys
who would like to discuss fair-
play with Jinks. To be blunt about
the matter Jinks has to fight the
women off. And he does it all quite
innocently.

Take the time he was at the
burlesque. His voice gave out so
he resorted to clapping the artistic
presentation, Jinks is artistic by
nature, lists five arts, literature,
music and cartooning as his hob-
bies. (SEE CUT.) From out of no-
‘where a slink female hand reached
over his shoulder and placed itself
between his. This led to conversa-
tion with the other end at the hand,
but Jinks hardly mentions this
incident as it was a too ordinary
occurance.

No class of girl is immune. At
the Mexican hotel he once visited,
the servants were of the lowest
order known above arachnoids. A
fat, sloppy maid with skin like a
seal and the provocative name of
Carmen took a shine to our “Jeenk-
sie.” She was an ex-bull fighter

himself in at night.

His irresistability knows no lim-
its. At home in Greenville, S. C. he
once dated a girl who had been
married on the sly. Years later
when hubby was away she would
come by for Jinks in her car. But
once again our hero limited his

affairs with this maiden to two

handed canasta, duces wild.

Broadminded James Jervy met,
accepted and conquered the chal-
lenge at Bob Jones College where
the boys can’t talk to the girls
after 6:00. He would write notes
and deftly flip them to a cute
waitress. but even this was soon
quelled. Undounted, he returned
in an hour dressed as a girl (pink
sweater, bangs. skirt, shaved legs)
sat in the soda shop with the girl
and got a date.

“Lovable”, on several occasions,
has given ficticious names to avoid
extra persistent persuers. One
Mexican hot tomato is still looking
for the Randolph Field who told
her such pretty things.

‘Lovable’s secret? Well it’s just
that — a secret. Every time you
try to pin him down he lowers his
head and starts mumbling about
his Spanish major or his future
plans to be a counselor at summer
Army camp. . . anything but why
girls find him so lovable.

Oh yes. Jinks has one problem:
he can’t get a date for Spring
Frolies.

though the stories were serious as
was the entire magazine. -

He ponders the fact that
perhaps censorship should be
clamped on bad literature as
a whole whether it is a poorly
written serious story or a hum-
orous tale which is out of taste.

It seems to him that both leave
an equally bad impression of the
college on the reading public. But
then he catches himself with the
remembrance that he is baing too
logical again.

.That’s out of style with the in-
quisition. He remains silent while
the charge is voted upon.

There is another man who
thinks the charge is a bit too
generalized. Let’s look into his
mind. He asks himself, “Just
what is the name of the col-
lege? It’s good. At least that’s
the impression ! get from those
with whom ¢ talk.

“I wonder why it’s good? Ac-
cording to these men it seems to
stem largely around what kind of
publications we send out to the
public.

“From all the persons who think
highly of ‘the collegg@I adjudge
that we must issue a tremendous
number of these spotless publica-
tions. Yet that is not the case.

“Bo the men who speak
about the ‘name’ as if it were
some absolute, some something
they can see, really know what
r and what is damaging to
it
“X seems to know yet he isn't

even at the college. Well, I haven't
anything definite I can prove.” He
also remains silent.

scholarships and play teams that don’t subsidize.

Granted, if we chose the

latter course, there would be

few banner headlines in the daily papers on Davidson’s athletic
events. But for my money, no headlines at all is better than a
running stream of headlines proclaiming Davidson “trounced,”
‘shaded,” “edged,” “walloped,” etcetera. It would be better,
it seems to us, because the game would be given back to the

boys who play it.
