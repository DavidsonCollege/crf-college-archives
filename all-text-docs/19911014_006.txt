DEPTH! RELEVANCE!

Go Braves!

In terms of geologic time
you’re basically already dead. So
root for the Braves. That’s what
this article’s about. You may stop
here and plunge into RUDE
NOTES for all we care.

Dear Depth! Relevance! Soci-
ety -- Uh, what's geologic time?

Well, we’re glad you asked.

To the geologic eye the drift-
ing continents leave a wake and
the Rockies seem tenuous. The
point is, geologically speaking, a
good hunk of granite holds much
more interest than a well adjusted
individual.

We humans have been around
maybe in the hundreds of thou-
sands of years. Nothin’! So, unless
you’re some sort of cool genetic
mutant with funky evolutionary
potential, you might as well cycle
your minerals back on into the
system. If youluck up, maybe some
of them will become a rock.

Still with me? Still worried
about mid-terms? Still think you
matter? I hope so. Being paltry,
humans need to value things, worry
a little -- you know, treasure life
and all that. We go about our little
duties: grades, career, family, etc.
We feel important. But when it
comes right down to the skin on

will: [f nothing,
especially nothing human in ori-
gin, matters anyway, you might as
well root for the Braves.

The members of our commit-
tee remember back in the 70’s going
to sleep with the radio on and
hearing Roland Office drift back
for a looooonnnngg fly ball -- he’s
going backbackbackback, he’s at
fence, he leaps, Oh! he’s crashed
into the wall, let’s see ifhe’s O.K..,
Oh, my! He caught it! He caught
the ball . .

We're not sure Roland Office
could leap, but he at least hopped a
little and he did hit the fence and he
did catch the damn thing. Roland
was a bit of a scrub, even on the
Braves, and all of us were shocked
and happy.

The Society has no idea why
this incident haunts our collective
consciousness, but it does. And it
matters just as much as the next
entry on your day timer (geologi-
cally speaking, of course).

The Braves won last night
(Thursday). A21 year old pitching
and they shutout the Pirates 1-Zip.

Oh, Yes!

Last spring, one of Dr. Mar-
con’s classes performed an Alco-
hol/Drug Use Survey in which 260
random Davidson students were
questioned ina seemingly exhaus-
tive manner. A few weeks ago, the
Davidsonian rananewsstory about
the findings of the survey, and the
results were, for want of a better
word, just interesting.

Very few people, I imagine,
were too startled by what they
understood the results to be. I
know that I did not bat an eyelash
upon reading that 87% of all
Davidson students surveyed have
drunk at least one beer during their
tenure here. That ought not be a
revelation to anyone. But in a
CCRL meeting two weeks ago,
Dean Terry handed outa summary
of the findings to the council
members, and as we read the nine-
page report, our mouths opened
one by one. In that medium, with
means and ranges and correlations
and standard deviation points, each
of us saw some pretty scary stuff.

We weren’t too suprised by
the alcohol statistics, but as we
read the report, few of us could
believe what we saw about an is-
sue, that I at least, had never really
even considered. I want to share a
few of the more enlightening
points:

36% of those surveyed feel sad.
37% are disappointed in them-
selves

25% don’ tenjoy things as much as
they used to.

‘Singin’ the Blues

41% are having a hard time moti-
vating themselves.

30% don’t sleep as well as they
used to.

46% get tired more easily.

21% percent “could be considered
mildly-moderately depressed.”

Spainhour

If the results are accurate, and
there is nothing to suggest that
they are not, then more than one in
every five Davidson students is
depressed according to the report
when the scores are weighed to-
gether. Using my sub-standard
math ability, that’s somewhere in
the neighborhood of 300 people.

And depression is more than
simply feeling down. My diction-
ary tells me that depression is “a
decrease in functional activity”.
300 Davidson students are not

emotionally able to “function” as
well as they ought to normally.
The implications of this are pro-
found.

I don’t pretend to be a psy-
chologist, but I can say without
reservation that I do not think that
it is acceptable for one in every
five of us to be depressed. It’s just
not OK.

I have to ask myself, “why?”
Why are there 300 people walking
around this campus feeling emo-
tionally unwell? Stress certainly is
a factor according to the report.
55% of those surveyed “strongly
agree” that the academic work load
is stressful; 34% more “agree”.
Further, only 15% “strongly agree”
with a statement reading “I am
satisfied with my academic per-
formance”. Maybe-stress is the
primary catalyst here, maybe it’s
not.

I don’t know that anything can
be done to make people less de-
pressed generally. After all, in the
“real world,” there are lots of
stressed out, depressed people. I
know this. I just can’t get the
whole thing out of my mind. I can
easily opine that we ought not let
stress control our lives,

Life, after all, is not about the
unattainable pursuit of a4.0 GPA
if the thought of getting out of bed
in the morning is revolting. But
I’m not completely sure stress is
allto blame. There are surely other
factors. One in five Davidson
students is depressed. That’ 's just
not OK. ‘
