IMAC Basketball

Newcomers Upset —
Old Guard ‘Teams

By HUNTER GOURLEY

IMAC basketball ain't what it used to
be. Forget the fact that the Czar no longer
reigns supreme. Pay no attention to the
50-odd team representatives who tote
those little blue IMAC booklets around
like it’s exam time already. Disregard the
“training rules” on page five of each
booklet (and fail to notice that its pages
are not even numbered). But remember.
pay attention, regard, and note that this
year’s freshman class has come to play
IMAC ball in 1983-84. The newcomers
are upsetting the old guard teams with lit-
tle exception in the women’s and the
men’s leagues. Ladies first.

Women’s Games

First and Foremost, acombination of.

Basement and Fourth Richardson forces,
whipped up on the supposed precision
powerhouse of the league, the Black Stu-
dent Coalition’s Sisters, Inc., by a score
of 37-16. Manager and F & F high
scorer Wendy Warner had 15 points.
Dana Lemon was the high scorer for the
game and the only scorer for the Sisters.

In other women’s league games
Warner Hall’s apparently superior diet
led to its squeaky victory over arch rival
Rusk in a 25-22 thriller, and the High
Two’s fell (one of the few freshman
teams to do so) to a more experienced
Mother’s Finest in a 14-8 loss.

B-League Play

In the Man’s B League (B for Big —
34 teams and six divisions) freshmen
teams continued to surprise their oppo-
nents. The Slammers of Second East
Belk manhandled the Grobetrotters 50-
32. The ’Trotters sported such experi-
enced athletes as Mark Nottingham,
Doug Ammar, and Dave Barnes but
proved they were no match for the scor-
ing talents of young Charles Stevens and
Chris Jones who together accounted for
almost half their team’s points.

Second Center Belk’s Second Com-
ing pulled a nine-point victory over the

A great way of lite,

independent team NAATP, 45-36. Steve
MacMillan’s freshman Yo-Yo’s wound
up beating yet another Gnfortunate inde-
pendent team, Yufi and the Redons, by a
score of 37-27. In a close inter-Belk con-
frontation that fortunately necessitated at
least one rookie team’s defeat, First Cen-
ter East’s mighty stiffs stood up to the
second West Accidents and beat them
43-34.

Pi Kappa Alpha’s Pat Millen, in
another noteworthy B-league game, got
mean inside and scored 20 of his team’s

(Mind If I Floss) 41 points in an eight-"

point game against Leave It To Beaver.
A-League Action

Freshman teams upset preseason fa-
vorites in Men’s A-league play this past
week also. First West’s Moral Hex made
use of consistent scoring from all five
starters to outgun the Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon number one team, Hard To Swallow,
53-49. Scott Brandon led all scorers with
22 points while the Hex’s J.D. Fleenor
and Todd Wiebusch hit for 14 points
apiece.

In a similar hard-fought game the
freshman Penetrators stuck it to the
BSC’s Cool Breeze in a last minute
frenzy that left the Breeze a little slack
and several points out. Ater a slow first
half, the Supreme Court found their
*break and passed a decided judgment on
the soccer team’s Charlie’s Chaps, 48-
30. Scott Huie, Stephan Dockery, and
Chip Craig combined for 31 of the
Court’s points while Tony Cabrales net-
ted 12 points for his team. The other KA
team, Right Stuff, recorded another vic-
tory over SAE team, Pony Express, 46-
42. Allin @il, it was a good week for KA
and a disappointing one for SAE.

Finally, another battle between the
frats, the Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Cham-
pagne Jam outplayed the Delts’ Pi Detta
Teta, 43-37, in a very physical contest.
The Jam’s Tenny Deane led all scorers
with a 13-point effort.

By STEVE SOUD

As a kid I heard a lot about how
sports help you grow as a human being
~— teaching you how to accept winning
and losing gracefully, and so on.
Somehow I was always sure that con-
cept was more theory than practice:
I’m sure we ve all had run-ins with our
share of sore losers, be it ourselves or
others. But this season I have disco-
vered this curious “losing gracefully”

theory put into practice — by the
women’s basketball team.
Doubtless some of the scores

(some with point spreads in the
nineties) have leaked out and been
whispered ‘round campus. Some of
these games make Little Big Horn look
like an afternoon stroll through the
park. Certainly there are intramural
teams enclosed with better talent than
the varsity. But none have more heart.
Never has a team with which I have
been associated (in any respect) been
more worthy of admiration than this
one. They forget last game’s score
while learning its lessons, and go out
and bust it for 40 minutes almost ex-
pecting to lose. That takes guts. (Un-
fortunately, the team often performs
this valorous feat before a handful of
derisive football players who would
have endured no similar taunts during
their own losing season.)

These women are noble and valor-

ous, but their hustle and hard work
have paid off. A glimpse at their scores
confirms improvement: Game number
one against Barber-Scotia, 23-115; 2)
Lenoir-Rhyne 22-97; 3) High Point,
20-96; 4) UNC-Wilmington, 44-138;
5) Barber-Scotia, 52-89. The differ-
ence between game one and game five
— against the same team — is remark-
able! Davidson more than doubled its
own offensive production and cut 26
points off Barber-Scotia’s previous
score. Davidson’s shooting percentage
across the same span soared from 12
percent to 37 percent. It’s all a team ef-
fort, because leading scorer Amy
Hartman is averaging only 5.4 ppg.

But a fundamental question one
must ask is, “How is it that so many
good players are flocking to IMAC?”
Varsity sports demand a huge commit-
ment, and this commitment is over-
powering on the team’s 27-game
schedule. One cannot expect non-
scholarship players to endure that kind
of schedule. With that in mind, Coach
Patty Daley is trimming next year’s
schedule to a more reasonable size: 16
to 20 games. With a little luck that re-
vised schedule could help lure some of
Davidson’s best players out of IMAC.

But in the meantime, this year’s
team will continue to sweat it out on
the basketball court. They'll work
hard, improve, and hopefully win a
game or two.
