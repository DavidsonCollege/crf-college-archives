Debate Squads
Open Season

The Davidson freshmen debaters will open their
schedule on Saturday, October 21, with a meet against |
the University of North Carolina novices. Dick Bates,
Conrad Shumadine, Bill Rule, and Paxton Wray will rep- |

resent Davidson, with Austin Letson making the trip to

Chapel Hill as alternate.

Dr. Joseph T. Drake, the De-
bating coach, predicts that the
Freshmen will “show up well”
at U.N.C., and at the Novice
Tournament scheduled for No-
vember 3 and 4 in Wake Forest.
If the boys fulfill his expecta-
tions in the two contests, Drake
suggests that he might “dissolve
the Novice team, and let them
compete with the upperclassmen
for positions on the Varsity at
other tournaments.”

dent of Columbia College in

The cat itself cost $35.00, not
including the $10.00 shipping
fee. Now, a traveling cage, a
trailer, and pen are being built
which will cost a total of about

$175. Martin hopes to raise this
money largely through student
contributions.

Some contributions were tak-
en after chapel yesterday from
students. A special box will be
displayed at the game tomorrow
for alumni and any other con-
tributors.

The cage and trailer will be
ready by the next out of town
football game. As soon as the
pen is ready, the wildcat will be
installed on the campus between
the Union and Duke. Said Mar-
tin, “We might even charge ad-
mission to see him eat live
chickens and rats.”

The biggest problem center-
td around the wildcat is to
eep students and wildcat out of
each others’ hair. “He’s hurt his
paw grabbing at a stick, and
gotten splinters in tongue from
biting one,” said Martin.

“We're keeping him on the
patio of the Union now, but
we'll probably have to move him
to the basement of Chambers
after Homecoming weekend. It
may take a while before people
begin to realize that he can
reach two feet out of his cage.”

Thousands To Watch
PC - Davidson Clash

Over 800 versions of beauty arrived today on campus
to help an equal number of eager males celebrate David-
son’s 1961 Homecoming. The Alumni Office reported
that it expects ‘several thousand” alumni and their fam-

ilies for Saturday’s Homecoming activities.

A giant Pep Rally kicked off
this year's Homecoming cele-
bration last night at 9:30. The
freshmen, led by the Pep Band,
marched through the upper-
class dorms to a huge bonfire
on the vacant lot across from
the Beta Theta Pi house.

Joe Martin and his cheer-
leaders led the student body
around the bonfire in tradition-
al college yells and a general
“whooping up” of the Davidson
fighting spirit

Students, their dates, and
guests will find a full schedule
of events this weekend, begin-
ning tonight at 8:00 with the
first Artist Series program of
the year. A soccer game origin-
ally scheduled for this afternoon
was called off because Carson-
Newman, the would-be oppon-
ent, could not field enough
players for the game.

The residents of Belk and
Richardson dormitories forfeit-
ed their rooms this afternoon at
2:30 to the 600 girls who are to
be housed there during the
week-end. Normally 422. stud-
ents occupy Belk and Richard-
son

Mrs. J. B. Moore, supervisor

of dormitories, announced that
the dates have also taken up
most the facilities in the
Guest House, homes of wavid
son residents, and ‘surrounding
motels. Because of the North
Carolina Trade Fair and the Na-
tional 400 at Charlotte Motor
Speedway track Sunday accom-
modations in Charlotte were
hard to find for visiting alumni

of

and dates.

The Mitchell-Ruff Trio, a mod-
ern jazz combination of piano,
bass, French horn and drums
initiates this year’s Artist Ser-
ies with a concert in Chambers
auditorium at 8:00 tonight.
Following the concert, the IFC
is sponsoring a formal dance in
Johnston Gymnasium featuring
Sam Donahue and the Tommy
Dorsey Orchestra.

At the dance tonight there
will be a figure during inter-
mission composed of the twelve
fraternity presidents, the IFC
representatives, and their dates.

After the dances Friday and
Saturday nights the various fra-
ternities will have their usual
after-parties. The Union, in con-
junction with the YMCA _ will
sponsor two swimming-dancing
after-parties at the pool in the

gymnasium from 12. midnight
until 5 a.m. Saturday morning
and from 12 midnight until 3

a.m, Sunday morning. There will
be elaborate ‘decorations, a
combo, and a lifeguard.

Saturday morning from 11:00
to 12:00 a.m. there will be a
judging of the fraternity Home-
coming decorations around Pat-
terson Court. The fraternity
with the best display will be
awarded a trophy plus $15 in
cash. The second and third
place entries will be awarded
$10 and $5 respectively. Judges
will be Dr. Clark, Mr. Stroud,
and Mrs. Moore.

Mascot Recovers From Rigors Of Travel

BY WILLIAM WALKER
Davidsonian Feature Editor

Cure Cat's Name - Neurosis

The Wildcat needs a name!

When the new mascot makes his debut tomorrow in
Richardson Stadium, he will be merely “it”, the wildcat.
Recognizing the damage this will cause to his personality
(who wants to remain. nameless?), THE DAVIDSONIAN
is sponsoring a ‘‘Name the Mascot” contest.

We invite students, dates, alumni—anyone in a
name-christening mood—to. submit suggestions to the
paper before 7 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 17. They should be
mailed to the paper, Box 218, or given to Editor David
Jordan.

A committee composed of the editors, President D.
Grier Martin and Head Cheerleader Joe Martin will select
the winner. The name will be announced in next week’s
DAVIDSONIAN and our wildcat will be a
christened at Saturday’s “Wildcat Day” game with .

Incidentally, $5 will go to the person submitting the
winning name!
