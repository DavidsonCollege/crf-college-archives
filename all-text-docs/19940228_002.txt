Study in China

Dr. Gill Holland will lead the first
Davidson study trip in China.

By Mary Laura Moretz

China is the ideal place to study
Chinese. culture, argues English
professor Dr. Gill Holland. Hol-
land urges Davidson students in-
terested in studying Chinese cul-
ture to do so firsthand next fall
with Wake Forest’s semester pro-
gram in China.

Wake Forest offers this fall-
semester program annually in co-
operation with South Atlantic
States Association for Asian and
African Studies(SASASAAS) and
China Educational Tours (CET).
Because Davidson is a member of
SASASAAS, Davidson students
are welcome to apply. In fact,
Holland says, “They’re wild to get
Davidson students to go.”

Dr. Holland has spent time in
Taiwan and Beijing, studied Chi-
nese at Stanford, translated a book
of Chinese poems, and taught
courses in Chinese literature.

He discovered the Wake For-
est program at a promotional pre-

sentation at Winthrop last year. He
has since accepted an invitation to
lead the trip in the fall of 1995. Dr.
Dorothy Borei of Guilford College
will serve as the faculty director of
the fall ‘94 trip.

Holland encourages students
to apply because he feels the west-
ern approach to teaching western
students at the Beijing Foreign
Languages Normal College proves
most productive. “There are some
Chinese programs that aren’t go-
ing to be as good. We’ve really
checked into this one — it’s tried
and true. You don’t want to waste
your time.”

Participants live in college
dorms and, unlike students atmany
larger schools, have the option of
requesting a Chinese roommate.

Course load includes work in
both Chinese language and cul-
ture, but previous experience with
either is not necessary. Holland
says, “You can jump into any level
of Chinese.” The program offers

language classes from beginning
to advanced. Next fall’s culture
class with director Borei is Jssues
in Contemporary China .

The trip, at just over seven
thousand dollars, is a great bar-
gain, according to Holland. Costs
include airfare, room and board,
weekend cultural excursions, and
even tickets to Chinese opera.

Other advantages to this trip
include the weather and the group.
Holland says, “Fall is the loveliest
time in Beijing.” The program
offers exposure to an international
crowdas the forty-five Westerners
who attend include students from
the U.S., France, and Germany.

Holland says students will find
their studies useful upon returning
to Davidson. Students can con-
tinue in self-instructional language
studies or take classes in Chinese
history, art, philosophy, politics or
literature.

Applicants should be upper-
classmen and have at least a 3.0
GPA. Interested students must
apply through the study abroad
office before the second week of
March, when decisions will be
made.

May confident in new Union board

By Jay Jennings

The Union Board officers ap-
pointed new committee heads last
week after a week of interviewing
possible candidates. Union Board
President Nat May is “confident
that the new committee heads are
going to inject new exciting ideas
into the Board.”

The 19 Union committees and
their chairs are: Concerts- Katie
Schwab; Davidson Outdoors- Rob
Clemens; Intimate Performances-
Whit Higgins; 900 Room- Jenny
Rose (Spring) and Morgan Perry
(Fall); Films- Carrie Blackburn;
Publicity- Allison Milligan; Video-
Martin Young; Campus Forum-
Stacey Carter; Gallery- Jenn Tracy;
Literary Arts- George Weld;

"Speakers- Dan Nechemias;

Women’s Issues- Sarah Orsbon;
Artists Series- Lylen Ferris
(Spring) and Brad Best (Fall);
Outpost- Sherry Abdelaaty; Cul-
tural Events-| Casey Hawthorne
(Spring) and Jenny Everett (Fall);
Secretary/Historian- Kristen Rich-
ardson; Publicity Artist- Geoff
Love; and. Members-at-Large-
Eleanor Hatcher, Anne Dunaway,
and Katherine Ross.

May and vice-presidents
Phoebe Dean and Rosie Molinary
conducted the interviews between
February 13 and February 20. Ap-
plicants noted on the application
which committee they wanted to
head.

According to May, after all of
the interviews, the three officers
spent “longer than they meant to”

selecting because all of the appli-
cants were qualified. The officers
are pleased with their decisions
even though they were .disap-..
pointed that they had to turn down
some qualified people.

New board members will take
control Wednesday at ajoint board
meeting. The old committee heads
have already scheduled the Union
activities for March which will
provide the new members time to
learn how to plan and run events.

The new Union Board has
been elected at a very important
time because of the discussion
about a new Union. Some people
are reluctant to support anew Union
until a definite need is shown. The
new board hopes to display this
need in the coming year.

CoMA holds talks about diversity

By Wendy Lee

Inanattemptto facilitate open
dialogue about racial issues at
Davidson, members of the Coun-
cil on Minority Affairs are meet-
ing with .freshman halls for the
third consecutive year.

The meetings, which began
last week and continue this week,
stress the importance of diversity
and encourage acceptance, toler-
ance, and outreach to minorities.

DeVane Tidwell, chairman of
the ten-member council, said the
visits aim at encouraging students
to “branch out and meet people
they may not normally be inclined
to meet.”

Issues addressed in the meet-
ings include the definition of a
minority, racial and cultural rela-
tions at Davidson, and racial prob-
lems at Davidson.

First Little hall counselorJohn
Murchison said the meeting pro-
vided an opportunity for “open dis-
cussion to get the freshmen talking
about race issues. . . It gets them

thinking about things they hadn’t
thought about before.” COMA
members Alden Smith, Amia
Canada, and Allison Sabel visited
first Little hall last Thursday.
First Little resident Matt Rich
found the meeting helpful. He
noted the importance of learning
by expressing ideas, “Plus,” he
said, “it helps you to get to know
the guys on your hall. . . The four
main areas we talked about were
minorities, homosexuals, women,

and different religions.”

Wendy McHugh, hall coun-
selor on fourth Cannon, said the
women on her hall discussed “try-

- ing to incorporate everybody into

life at Davidson.” The meeting

“brought a. lot of awareness be- -.

cause the students didn’t know
about all the opportunities at
Davidson.” She noted that the
women acknowledged that it is
easy to “get into specific groups
and become apathetic.”
