Cats surge destroys Brown

By DAVID VAUGHAN
Staff Writer
The Wildcats overcame a
dismal first half Monday night
to pommel the Brown Bruins
75-58 at the Charlotte Coli-
seum.

_ Down by three at the half, the
Cats went on a 17-point tear
during the openings minutes of
the second half to break open a
tight game. .

The blowout of the second
half appeared as if it would
occur in the first half as
Davidson jumped to a 10-4 lead
behind the brilliant play of Pat
Hickert. Enter Chuck Mack and
Peter Moss for Brown. With the

score 12-8, the two combined for_

18 of the Bruins’ next 21 points
giving them a 31-28 lead at the
half.
In an effort to neutralize
Brown's slowdown offense and
spur offensive movement by his
own team, Biedenhach de-
cided to go with the full court
trap that had earlier ruined

only other Davidson wrestler to
finish in the money.

Coach L.R. King indicated he
was generally pleased with the
team’s performance and. said he
thought the squad would do
better later in the season.

Swimmers crush Pfeiffer

By SKIP BARKLEY
_ Staff Writer

The Davidson College swim-
ming team opened its season
Tuesday with a 75-28 trouncing
of Pfeiffer College.

Wildcat Coach Pat Miller was
obviously pleased with the Da-
vidson effort. She said, ‘‘This
was only a tune-up for our big
meet with UNC-Wilmington.
The team's performance was
commendable considering that
no one swam in their speciality
events.” ;

Mark Tommerdahl was a
double winner in the meet.

‘ Tommerdahl took first place in
the 200 yard individual medley
and the 200 yard backstroke.
Pete Neefus was a double
winner also with victories in
both diving events.

Other Wildcat winners inclu-
ded Steve Yood, 1,000 yard
freestyle; Craig Allen, 600 yard
freestyle; Paul Voight, 200 yard
freestyle; and Craig Finger in

the 200 yard breaststroke.

In addition, Davidson won
the medley and freestyle relays.

The final score could have
been more lopsided had the
Wildcat swimmers participated
in their primary events. In-
stead, Miller preferred to let the
team stay loose prior to the

confrontation with UNC Wil-
mington at UNCC’s pool Satur-
day.

Saturday’s match is expected
to be a stiffer challenge for
Davidson. A victory would
justify the Wildcats’ early sea-
son optimism.

Connecticut in the C.I.T. It
proved to be the perfect answer
to the Cats’ problems as it
shifted Brown out of their
patient offense.

The difference is best shown
in the shooting percentages of
the two halves. In the first half,
with their slowdown offense,
Brown shot 66 percent; while in
the second half, flustered by
Davidson’s press, the Bruins
dropped to a paltry 32 percent.
The quicker tempo of the game.
enabled Davidson's shooting
percentage to jump from 52
percent in the first half to. an
unbelievable 75 percent in the
second half.

The second.half opened with
Jamie Hall controlling the tap,
and from there, Golden Arm
Gerdy took control. Hitting
from everywhere, the Gerd
used his patented accu-bombs
to destroy the Bruins. But
surprisingly, nerhans hin best
play was not a shot but a pass,
An inside feed by John led to a
crushing dunk by Hall, and for

The squads from Davidson,
UVI, Elon, and The Citadel will
each be pitted against one
of the other three squads in
succession. —

Dulany cautioned that the
team’s lack of depth will be at a

the first time since the middle of
the first half, the Cats led.

When Gerdy finished his act,
in stepped Todd Haynes. Not to
be outdone, the flashy sopho-
more buried the already dead
Bruins by scoring nine points in
a four-minute spree. All that
was left from that point was a
spinning double-pump move by
Carter Todd that brought the
crowd to its feet.

For the game, Davidson shot
an amazing 63 percent, as
Gerdy led the way with a 12-17
night. His efforts netted him
a game high 28 points and kept
his season’s shooting percen-
tage around the 70 percent
mark.

Following Gerdy was Haynes
with 18 and Hickert and Hall
with eight. Besides scoring
eight, Hall made an important
defensive contribution in help-
ing to hold Andy Dolan to two
points. Dolan was the major
contributor in Brown’s win over
Davidson last year. Also con-
tributing defensively were Ernie
Reigel and Rich Perky who both
chipped in with two points.
points.

In Saturday night’s game
Davidson used a superior inside
attack to dominate a hapless
Wofford team, 110-74, Haynes
led the Cats’ attack with 26
while Gerdy followed with 25.
The two games leave the Wild-
cats with a 4-0 mark with 8th
ranked N.C. State scheduled

cause most of the other teams
have two or three wrestlers at

each position.

The depth problem was exac-
erbated this week, however,
when it was learned that junior
heavyweight Rob King will be
out for the season with a knee
injury. Last year King posted
the best individual record on
Davidson's team.

The team hopes another one
of last year’s top wrestlers,
sophomore Pat McKinsey, will
be healthy enough to return .to
the mat this week.

The Cats did add a team
member, however, sophomore
Dave Nichols. He is slated to
begin competition immediately
in the 190 pound weight class.
