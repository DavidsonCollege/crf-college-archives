To The Freshmen

By JOE COLLEGE
Becoming a freshman in college is an important
event in the life of any young man. Becoming a fresh-

man at Davidson makes that event even more important!

' On behalf of the old students of Davidson, we-wish to]°

extend a hearty welcome to all new men, and to extend

a few suggestions and cautions which we hope will be

helpful in your life here. ‘

to work on becoming a Davidson man.

You*who have come from high school at a ‘rather

young age will probably need to budget your time to en-
able you to take in everything that goes on here and still
cope with the study situation, which, after all, is the real
reason you’re here. Never forget that although you may
be very popular and very happy because you don’t miss
a show or a social function, your diploma is not granted
on these activities. Those of us who have been in college
a while have learned that lesson, we hope, though some-
times it’s been the hard way.

Do not, however, confine your life entirely to studies.
Extra-curricular activities at Davidson are on an un-
usually fine working basis as compared with many other
war-time colleges, and it will be to your advantage to

~take-part-in- some of them. Stand off and look before
you leap, and you'll "help yourself and others, too.

Davidson is noted as a Christian college. You, as
a member O¥ajts student body, will be expected to live
as a Christian gentleman at all times. Being a Christ-
ian is not a “sissy” job—it’s one of the hardest things
in the world. By making a try you'll win the respect
of all who know you, and you will be a much happier
person.

Finally, realize the seriousness of this business of
going to college. This is not vacation, and what you do
