on the parents which comes with
young manhood and womanhood to
follow one’s gwn conscience and to
make one’s own decisions.

These two conflict rather pain-
fully and suggest that it is possible
to reconcile the two by not merely
being nice to mothers on Mother's
Day, but by substituting true
friendship for that earlier-emotional
dependence. Friendship requires|
generosity on both sides.

An example of the way in which
we can show our love for our par-

Mrs. Cumming ended by saying
that the most important thing that
young men and women can do for
their mothers not to perform
their duty in wartime but when the
next peace comes to dedicate their
intelligence, energy, and courage to
a new attempt to build a world
which will be able to keep peace.

Sermon Given
By Pritchett

Addressing his remarks  primar-
ily to the Senior class, Rev. Carl
Pritchett spoke last Sunday’ night
on “The Need of Patience,” taking
his text from Heb. X :35-39; 11:1.
Mr. Pritchett stated that only by
faith can the just survive. During
this period of world
history, the tendency—is to resent

“The just shall live by faith.” This

| When Habakkuk observed the tri-

fumphs of Babylon, he could not un-

| derstand why Israel, God's people,
lwere overcome. Jehovah explained
|that Babylon was merely ‘used to

| Babylon would’ be destroyed

|
| The speaker said that patience
| riginated in faith in God. This
aed he said, is “the substance of

things-hoped for.” God's sovereignty
is manifested in his guidance of hu-
man history and in his direction of
our personal lives. A well-balanced
individual has faith in God and in
mankind which gives him a buoy-
ancy and helps him to keep his head
up.
Rey. Pritchett closed by telling
of an incident occurring in the life
of Bishop Wilbyforce and Thomas
Carlyle. As they were walking one
day, Carolyte asked Wilbyforce,
“My lord, do you have a creed?
“Yes, and it grows firmer under my

Patience, the foundation of hope

permanently remain where there is

“And now for another question,
Mr. Cordon. How long have you
been with the Metropolitan Opera
Association?”

“Five years,” he replied.

“And how many roles have you
sung during this time?”

“I’ve sung sixty-seven roles, and
out of this group, I believe Faust
is my favorite. I also like the Mar-
riage of Figaro very much; I sang
two arias from this opera tonight,
you know.”

“Mr. Cordon,” I asked, “what are
some of your hobbies?” »

“Well, I tell you,” he replied, “I
consider myself an
penter.”

Mrs. Cordon approached from off
the stage, and I asked her if-it-were
true that her husband was talented
as a carpenter. She replied in the
affirmative and that singing
was only one of her husband's ac-

excellent car-

I asked the Metropolitan star if |
he had often appeared before audi- |
ences of college students |

“Yes,” he replied, “I have; I al-
ways enjoy singing for college stu-
dents because they are enthusiastic
and appreciative.”

I left the singer to the mercy of
the autograph seekers and camera
fiends. T pushed my way through
the crowd knowing that I had had
the opportunity of hearing a great
opera singer and meeting a delight-
fully friendly and interesting man.
