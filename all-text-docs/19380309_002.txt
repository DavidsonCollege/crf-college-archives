Your Opportunities

During the next few weeks, the College
offers the student a variety of entertain-
ment which he cannot afford to miss. Such
opportunities should not be passed-up.

This year, music of a high type has been
brought student.
There have been no fees on the concert se-

within reach of every
ries. There are several lectures scheduled for
next month.

The thought that many colleges our size
have no such cultural opportunities should
awaken one to the fact these things should
not be missed.

Publication Elections

Every year there is considerable dissen-
sion over the matter of the student body
electing the campus editors. This dissension
usually comes from members of the staff
who believe that elections would be fairer if
the staff to vote for their editor.
Chief object: fairer selection,

were

However, politics would undoubtedly en-
ter staff elections and consequently they
would be even more unfair.

However, when the student votes for a
campus editor, he ought to have some idea
of the man’s qualifications. Nor is this pos=
sible unless the voter makes it a point to
find out. And the voter should try to find
gut from some unbiased man on the staff,
if there is such, just who knows the work
best and promises to be the best editor.

The Literary Societies

Just because the two literary societies on
the campus are not exclusive, purely honor-
ary organizations, most of us are all too
prone to overlook the worth in them.

(iranted that an occasional man joins to
get his picture in the annual. Granted that
the requirements for admission are not rigid.
Granted that, in some cases, the programs

ire not all they should be.

But these things are unimportant com-
pared with the fine things obtainable from

literary society. Of course, it is assumed

that the societies offer training in publica-

speakyng and rules of order. There is one

to exhaustion and terrific odds,

Again this spring our basketball team
suffered a big disappointment, only a piti-
fully few points keeping it out of the con-
ference tournament. It would be pleasant
to remember our game here with Clemson
as typical of the games we played. To say
the going was tough would be putting it
mildly, With the invitation to the tourna-
ment at stake and backed by a fickle student
body, the team played its very heart, out.
With a team that plays like that, what’s the
difference who wins? Of course, it would
be more pleasant to win, but what is vic-
tory compared with the satisfaction of
knowing THAT YOU HAVE FOUGHT A
GOOD FIGHT; THAT YOU HAVE KEPT
THE FAITH? That iself is a victory that
can never be taken away. Where do we
get the idea that we have a spirit? Do we get
it from the excess of wins over losses? Of
course not. From the way we play the game
we have well deserved the reputation of
having a spirit unequaled anywhere. It is
up to us to keep it alive and to pass it on.

It is a privilege to be a member of a stu-
dent body so well represented by our teams.
Persuaded to come to Davidson by a brother
a student of another college, but who had

seen the spirit, I thank’ my lucky stars I
came here. It is indeed a pleasure to offer
my hunble contributions to the spirit of the
Wildcat, the spirit that never dies.

his car stopped. He descended and
discovered the cause of his trou-

Speaking to the old woman who
opened the door he said: “Do you

The old woman shook her head.

“Any oil will do. Haven't you got
