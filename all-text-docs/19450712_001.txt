FIVE MEN GIVEN BIDS BY ODK

D.C. Aids In
War Eftort

Over Two Thousand Alumni
Now Serving Their Country
Situated on the ridge of hills that

crosses North Mecklenburg, David-

son College has, with a poise and
dignity acquired during 109 years of
existence, maintained her traditions
while making a sizable contribution
to the winning of the war. Fully
realizing that the peculiar genius of
the Christian College is in the field
of Peace and World Brotherhood,

Davidson nevertheless freely offered

her facilities for the training of

young men for the Army. Since this”
period of double duty~ began in

March 1943 the college has maintain-

ed her standards in civilian instruc-

tion and has at the same time had

a vital part in the initial training of

2227 students of the Army Air
Forces.

Since the War Department with-
drew the last of its trainees in

December 1944, Davidson once again
become a civilian college, imparting
the ideals of liberal education and
Christian living to a small student
body made up of the very young,
those physically unfit for the rigors
of military life-‘and those devoted
to for the Christian
ministry. Men who-may still grasp a
few months of Davdson's cultural,
scientific and religious training, do
so, in the hope of having a better
part in the better society of future
years.

Both of the student military train-
ing units at Davidson were under
the control of the Army and the
trainees were given instructions in
specialized courses prescribed. by
the Army Air Forces. For this rea-
son, these Army students were never
a part of the civilian college. The,
alumni ‘office .at the college
made’ no attempt to keep up with
their miltary careers after their de-
parture from the campus and does
not consider them to be alumni of
the institution. (
