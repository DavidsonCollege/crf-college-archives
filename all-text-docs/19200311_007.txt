”

Prof. A. R. Banks, 69. Memories of | 2&°-

old school days were revived in the

minds of many Davidson alumni;

when they heard the announcement :
of his death. He was laid to rest on
February 26 in the New Unity ceme-
tery at Fort Mill, S. C.

Alexander Robinson Banks was
born at Hazlewood, Chester county,
May 27, 1847, his parents being the
Rev. William Banks and his wife,
Marry E. Harrington. His early
education was received from the
best of the old school masters of the
time. After serving as a young sol-
dier in the last months of the war,
where he became a drill master of
recruits, he entered Davidson Col-
lege, from which he graduated with
distinction in 1869.

He then took up the profession of
teaching, and for 51 years spent his
life in the work which he enjoyed so
much, and for which he had a gen-
uine passion. Being suspected by
the United States government of
having a prominent connection with
the activities of the Ku Klux Klan
in York county, S. C., he, along with
others, was forced into exile. He
established at Pleasant Ridge, Ala.,
a boys’ school, afterwards removed
to Tuscaloosa, where for many years
it flourished. In 1875 the death of
his father recalled Professor Banks
to South Carolina. He then estab-
lished the Fort Mill Academy, where
he prepared and sent to Davidson
many young men of South Carolina.
His students were admitted to col-
* lege without examinations.

After teaching and farming for
some years at Fort Mill, he removed
to Rock Hill, where in 1888 he open-
ed with 115 pupils the first public
school in South Carolina. However,
the managerial side of school teach-
ing did not appeal to Colonel Banks,
and in 1891 he and his friends estab-
lished the Presbyterian High School
in Rock Hill. This was later absorb-
ed by Winthrop College, whose loca-
tion in Rock Hill was due in part to
the inspiration for education which
Professor Banks gave the com-
munity. He taught later at York-
ville, Lancaster, and Hyde Park.

Professor Banks was never quite
in sympathy with the modern meth-
ods of teaching, for his work was
essentially that of preceptor. He
was a school master of the old type

- and was convinced that if a student
did not learn he was in need of prop-
er “pressure” and this did not often
fail to do the work. Naturally, at
the time some of his students
thought him a hard taskmaster, but
from the expressions to be heard
since his death there remains not
one but who is most grateful to their
former school master for his stern-

books. He was perhaps the last of
the old-fashioned school masters.

Upon America’s entrance into the
war, Colonel Banks made repeated
efforts to get into the service as a
Y. M. C. A. teacher or otherwise. He
was eager to go to France in some
capacity, with the old First South
Carolina regiment, but his age was
against him.

The last few years of the great

educator’s life was spent in teach-,

ing public schools and_ tutoring.

young men for college. He declared
that he was doing the best work of;

his life, and this is proven by the
results of his work. Rarely did he

fail to get “his boys” in when they |

competed for scholarships at West,
Point and Annapolis. Among his
former pupils were numerous army
officers in the war ranging in grade!
from colonels and lieutenant-col-:
onels down to majors and captains.
He was particularly proud of these
men.

With the passing of Colonel Banks
the South has lost one of its greatest
educators, the State,of South Caro-
lina has been deprived of one of her
most noble sons, and Davidson Col-

ness in requiring strict attention

to take charge of the Davidson Col-
lege Library.

In the hands of Miss Shaw, the or-
derliness and consequent usefulness
of the library has greatly increased.
Even before the present excellent
library building gave opportunity
for the broadening of the scope o
her work, her influence made itself
felt in an efficiency that has been al-
ways increasing. Because of a uni-
versal sympathy and a cheerfulness
that never fails, Miss Shaw isa
