Question

lite
George Marsh, Sophomore:

Among the students the question

of the chapel programs has always
béen a point controversy. We
all realize that if we do not de

rive something helpful from our
morning devotionals there is no;
real value in having them. I for
one have thought that the YMCA
devotionals for the past few days
have been especially well prepared
and presented. Also, IT believe the
student body has had a favorable
reaction toward them. They have

been concise and to the point. The

students have received some value

from them and TI believe the ser-
vices would! be more orderly and
better if

tinue to have this type of program.

These last few services have shown

Pat Hobson, Junior:

The recent series have certainly
had a more deeply religious at-
mosphere associated with them.

‘James McDuffie, Junior:

Undoubtedly our chapel services
are usually the most irreverent of
their kind one would imagine but
under the circumstances you don’t
“wonder why. This present setup of |
chapel exercises was well covered |
at the last group discussion and |
|
|
step toward a change or revision |
to break the monotony of things |
is at this time essential for the |
future success of these devotions.
This new type of service seems to,
be furthering this end more than)
anything so far and in so far that |
it is doing that it is doubtless
worthwhile. The trouble I think
with the majority of chapel talks is
that most or many of the speakers
seem to think a revolution will re- |
sult from their talks. If we are
going to have chapel at all it should
be done right, and quiet thought-
ful devotions should be held.

Walter Kyle, Freshman:

I believe this type of chapel is
very constructive and that we
should have more of it. I think
that we should always have music
with the prayer or at least more_
often, as I am sure we all found
this adding greatly to the worship- |
ful atmosphere as well as to the,
beauty of the service.

By all means keep up this more
meaningful worship service.

At a season of the year when
religious thought is being directed
toward one specific theme it seems
quite appropriate that our chapel
programs point in that direction.
While too much of this would tend
to lead to monotony, planned pro-
grams can do much to enrich the
significance of such seasons in the
year.
