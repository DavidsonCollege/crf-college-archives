Regulation with Reason

The present administrative release
concerning the parking situation is a posi-
tive and necessary approach to a problem
of concern to many students. In its in-
formative nature, it clarifies questionable
clauses and adds meaning to the regula-
tions. More of this type of clarification and
positive approach is needed and necessary
in administrative-student relations. Regu-
lations without reason are not justifiable
to most, and they often lead to misunder-
standing and predicated injustice. In-
formation; denoted by clarity, objectivity,
and a positive approach on matters per-
taining to the college and the student body
should be presented. Thursday's chapel
service is one such program of presenta-
tion. More are welcome, more are needed,
more are requested.

The administrative release revealed
that Davidson is, in reality, quite fortu-
nate in its parking facilities, and much
planning has evidently gone into the ac-
tualization of them. Further, areas of stu-
dent concern have been justified and al-
lowances made as requested when such
were possible.

It is tragic to note in light of the above
that some 200 offenses have been regis-
tered in the bursar’s office in the less than
three weeks of operation of this system.
Many of these are second and third time
offenders. From informed sources it was
learned that little monetary return is re-
alized in this program of fines—instituted
solely to enforce the regulations—when
total costs of operation are considered.
This adds up to one thing—the lazy driver
in the early hours should think twice
before he pulls into a zoned area—in order
to avoid purse pulling and painful time
expended on both sides of the financial
fence.

Beyond the Polished
Apple

The after Vesper hour is a forgotten
opportunity. In recent years, attendance
has receded to the sacred few; interest
waned; and the tragic myth of freshman
days accepted for fact. First of all, after
Vesper visits are not the panacea of all
intellectual ills: classes in reverse: or
seminars of astronomical IQ's on classic
‘astrology. Neither are they means to
academic ends. Rather they offer an un-
equaled opportunity for students and
faculty to rub minds, interests, and ex-
periences together in an atmosphere of
congeniality. It is a media of expression
not found in such abundant fashion or en-
joyable circumstances elsewhere in the
college calendar. A real education can
truly be sought and secured in faculty
homes, where topics of discussion range
from trout to tanks, from the sacred South
to the hallowed halls of Hahvahd, and
where the culinary arts are not to be re-
fused.

Most objections or abstentions to this
hour of charm fall into the category of
lack of time. Anything worth a person’s
time is worth planning for; and this par-
ticular evening hour should require but
little foresight in the student schedule.
Those who do not take advantage of these
opportunities miss a real and lasting part
of their college education. Educate the
whole man. Take in the after-Vesper hour.

Vesper Verdict

It has been deplorably noted by many
students that the character and quality of
our Vesper programs have degenerated in
recent years. Former days witnessed a
parade of large men from wide areas
presenting subjects in stimulating ap-
proaches, stirring the thinking mind as
well as the feeling heart. It has been ques-
tioned whether recent semesters compare
favorably with former years.

Many of the speakers scheduled to

appear have failed to materialize on Sun-
day evening. Further, most of the
speakers while qualified and capable come
from a very limited and local area. There
is also a greater predominance of these
speakers from one denomination than in-
dicated by the student body percentages.

In an era of chapel progress and ap-
preciated achievement, the interested set
high levels of expectation from the Vesper
program. Student concern should illicit
administrative evaluation and considera-
tion in this matter. R.H.M.

Reformer’s Manual

The urge to reform things has ex-
pressed itself in many different ways at
many different times. And ever since
Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden de-
cided that a reformation of their eating
habits was in otder, change and innova-
tion have been discouraged both by those
who honestly believe things are good
enough as they are and by those who are
afraid that change will bring unexpected
complications.

The following items are suggested to
provide the compulsive reformer with
some new ammunition,-now that agitation
for the “initiative, referendum, and re-
call” has lost some of its original appeal
or has secured some of its objectives.

Anyone who believes that the meas-
urement system arose out of the practice
of counting on the fingers and toes must
have reached the conclusion that some of
our Anglo-Saxon forefathers had twelve
fingers and twelve toes. The duodecimal
system of measuring and counting, along
with the multitude of varying units, has
been one of the greatest curses in our
heritage. High school mathematicians
have been plagued no end by problems
about the conversion of feet to inches to
fathoms to yards to miles. Science has
long since given up hope on this matter
and has adopted the metric system, which
makes conversion from one unit to another

_ possible by the simple placement of a

decimal point. The advantages of a deci-
mal system are obvious to Americans who
must get out a pad-of paper to figure up
how much change would be due them in
Britain if they gave a five-pound note in
payment for a purchase of three items
each costing three shillings and six pence.

Another source of confusion is the
calendar which we use. Holidays, anni-
versaries, fiscal periods—all these and
others change with chaotic regularity.
Businesses find it difficult to compare
profits with those made during the same
period of the previous year because one
such period might contain an additional
Saturday, a good day for business. Holi-
days such as Veterans Day and Christmas
wander all through the week like the
planets through the heavens, and others
escape this fate only because they are
prescribed for a certain day of the week
rather than day of the month. A World
Calendar would stabilize the dating of al!
events, since the calendar would be the
same every year. Printers of calendars are
not expected to agree that the. adoption
of a World Calendar would be a wise
move, but there is more hope that others
will see its merits.

As another project for the reformer,
we suggest that he advocate the writing of
dates as 2 December 1955 rather than
December 2, 1955. This practice, already
adopted by much of the world, . would
bring the United States into agreement
with current practices.

And as a parting suggestion, why can
we not drop the period from common ab-
breviations such as Mr and Dr? They are
in such common: use that they would be
perfectly understood without the period.
We are not quite ready to advocace the
dropping of capital letters, since mr e. e.
cummings has had little luck in gaining
converts.

These suggestions should give our re-
former many reforms to advocate, and we
rather suspect that it will be a long time
before he achieves success, regardless of
the merits of the proposals.—M.A.C.

The Court of Control and Its

BY HOBBY CO8B

Judge Of The Court Of Control

What has happened to the Court
of Control? This is a question that
has been asked repeatedly this fall
and, I believe, justifiably so. The
school year 1955-56 may be re-
membered as the year that the
Court of Control lost any power
that it previously held, and the
year the Freshmen class was al-
lowed to break any and all regula-
tions without fear of reprimand.

This freedom enjoyed by the
class of ’S9 is something that has
gradually been coming to the front
for several years. Each year for
the past two or three, the upper-
classes have slowly but surely fost
interest in the Court and its func-
tions. Many students feel es if
the Court is not really intended to
do good, but rather is a form of
legal hazing. Those who believe
that the Court is a good thing end
definitely has a plece in student
government have failed to support
their beliefs, and the result is that
& group of eight students is left

alone trying to work with an en-
tire Freshman class.

There are still others who think
that the Freshman class is at fault.
The class as a whole has been re-
ferred to as “a cocky bunch who
want to run the campus.” I believe
thinking of this type to be out of
line. Freshmen enter Davidson not:
knowing a thing about the Court
of Control except what they have
read in the Wildcat Handbook. How
can we expect them to act any dif-
ferent when they see that the up-
perclassmen look on the Court of
Control as a joke and don’t care
whether or not the Freshman Reg-
ulations are enforced? No, the
Freshmen are not guilty of a poor
attitude, but rather we are respon-
sible as upperclassmen for not dis-
playing the proper interest. Our
disinterested attitude was carried
over to the Freshmen and was re-
flected in their actions.

Take for example the three Court
meetings that were scheduled dur-
ing Freshmen Chapel — upper-
classmen were urged to attend yet

LITTLE MAN ON THE CAMPUS... by Dick Bibler

Report from Detroit

By JIM BATTEN

Snowstorms, automobile plants,
Pulitzer Prize winners and College
newspaper editors with Yankee
brogues were a dime a dozen in
Detroit two weekends ago, as the
Davidsonian’s four-man editorial
contingent ventured above the Ma-
son-Dixon, The occasion was the
3ist anfiual convention of the As-
sociated Collegiate Press at De-
troit’s spacious Hotel Statler.

The ACP, of which the David-
sonian is a member, together with
co-hosts Ford, Chrysler and Gen-
eral Motors, provided a lavish yet
educational! three-day program for
the eight hundred delegates who
poured in from thirty-three states,
Canada, and the District of Colum-
bia.

The convention program featured
outstanding journalists and news-
paper men from all o.-:r he na-
tion who spoke and led round-
table discussions where college
editors swapped ideas and aired
mutual problems encountered on
American campuses across the con-
tinent.

In addition, the agenda included
an all-day trip Thursday through
Ford’s gigantic River Rouge plant,
where mile-long buildings and as-
tronomical daily production levels
of automobiles are commonplace.

As far as the Davidson foursome
was concerned, the entire expedi-
tion met with near disaster before
even getting out of Mecklenburg
County, as Editor Morehead’s lim-
ousine balked and then rolled dead
about two miles shy of the Char-
lotte Airport at three o'clock in
the morning. With Samsonite at
port arms, we set out down the
black road at a painful lope, scat-
tering loosely packed Davidsonians
over the countryside. Fortunately,
after a- mile of this, a charitable
soul rattled onto the scene and de-
posited us at the terminal with ten
minutes to spare. Three hours later,
dawn in Detroit at a brisk seven-
teen degrees shattered our ther-
mostats after a week of Carolina's
Indian summer.

Max Shvuiman, a versetile young
playwright who recently copped e
Pulitzer Prize, was on hand to
handle the after-dinner speaking
chores for Chrysler Thursday night.
His Broadway hit of a few seasons
back provides the basis for the new
Frank Sinatra — Debbie Reynolds

technicolor comedy, The Tender

Trap.

The heartt of the meeting came
Friday and Saturday as top-notch
newspaper men and members of
the journalism faculties from De-
troit’s Wayne University and forty-
mile distant University of Michigan
answered questions and guided dis-
cussions on various phases of col-
lege newspaper publication. Per-
sonal contacts and conferences with
these men proved perhaps the most
helpful phase of the entire pro-
gram.

After hours, Atlanta’s own Frank-
lin Bloodworth, the only real city
boy among the local delegation
managed to keep us in hot water.
His suggestion for a place to get
a “good meal” led to the dubious
sounding Olde Wayne Club. Be-
fore we could resist, we were
whisked to a dimly-lit table by a
battery of. hovering waiters with a
great flourish of “Ah, Monsieurs.”
A glance at the menu confirmed
our direst fears, with nothing in
English except the all too legible
prices. At this point Davidson
genius reared its head as More-
head suggested to the solicitous
waiters that perhaps we should re-
turn later instead for the floor
show. The hamburgers in the next
block were delicious.

Saturday night, General Motors,
not to be outdone by her cross-
town rivals, trotted out eight hun-
dred prime steaks and her Chief
Research Consultant Charles F.
Kettering. With thirty-three hon-
orary degrees, Or. Kettering has
achieved global fame as an inven-
tor and pioneer in the automobile
industry. His electric ignition sys-
tem for sutomobiles was respon-
sible for shoving the once essential
auto crank forever into history.

As the Eastern Air Lines Con-
stellation bounced onto the Char-
lotte runway early Sunday morn-
ing, bringing us back to looming
stacks of dusty books and im-
pending reviews, a point from Ket-
tering's address concerning true
values in modern education in gen-
eral and on testing methods in
particular proved consoling: “On
an I. Q. test, Wilbur Wright, Henry
Ford, and Thomas Edison combined
couldn't have gotten into the
bleachers, much less the grand-
stand.”

only fifty showed up at the first
meeting and e mere handful the
second time round. Needless to say,
the third meeting was called off.
Therefore, | contend that the stu-
dent body as a whole must shoul-
der s great deal of the blame for
the failure of the Court of Control.

This is not to say that the stu-
dent body is completely responsible
for the failure of the Court. On
the contrary, every member of the
Court is willing, ! am sure, to share
in the’ blame. I can say however,
that the members of the student
body represented on the Court of
Control searched for the answer
to the problem, and no one worked
harder to restore it to its proper
place than your Student Body Presi-
dent. With your support I think he
could have done this—it still can
be done. :

If the Court of Control is to be
restored as an effective organiza-
tion there will be a need for a lot
of time and study. This is being
done now by the Student Council
in their attempt to find the answer.

Year of Decision

In order to get the Court back on
its feet there are three things that
must be done:

(1) The Court should be restored
in Friday chapel. Many people feel
that the Court will never be effec-
tive unless this is done. When the
Court is made to function outside
of chapel, the Student Body loses
contact and as a natural result
they lose interest.

(2) Secondly, the Court of Con-
trol should be put before, the Fresh-
man class as a scheduled part of
Orientation Week. This was not
done this fall and the Freshmen
remained in the dark as to the pur-
pose of the Court and its function.

(3) Thirdly, the Fraternities must
get behind the Court by impress-
ing upon their pledges the import-
ance of the Freshmen Regulations.
This was not done in several cases

this year and as a result a good -

deal of harm was done.

Even though these three points
could do a lot toward restoring the
Court of Control, there is another
side to the argument that cannot be

overlooked. Many students don’?
want the Court of Control and are
very much against its purposes.
There is a feeling here on the
compus that the court is just an.
other one of those Davidson Tradi.
tions that has outgrown its useful.
ness. These same people suggest
that we should have no Freshman
Regulations, but rather adopt the
policy used in northern schools.
That is, have the student body
create such an atmosphere of ma.
turity that the freshmen will want
to throw away their high school
habits and pick up the ways of
the upperclassmen. This is just one
of the suggested solutions.

In closing, I would say that this
article was written to show just
where the Court failed, and to
present a few of the problems that
will have to be overcome if it is
to ever function properly. The fact
is that a change is needed. Whether
it be to rebuild or to do away with
is the decision that you as a student
must make. Leaving things status
quo should not even be considered.

Council Committee Processing
Elections System Revisions

By STUART VAUGHN, Chairman, Student Council Elections Committee

The elections system at David-
son College is in part due for a
change. This has been the concen-
sus of opinion at Davidsoh for a
number of years, but not a great
deal has been done about it, This
year steps are being taken by the
Student Council to correct the anti-
quated election rules and to clear
up those rules which need to be
clarified.

Even though there are some
parts of our elections system that
need revision, there are also parts
that are well and good as they now
stand.

One of the major criticisms of
elections at Davidson is holding
them in chapel. The opposition to
the chapel elections has said that
a minority rules, that the elections
add to chapel confusion, and that.
many students vote more than once.

However, if the elections were
held outside. of chapel, perhaps as
a voluntary meeting, there would
probably be only half the people
voting that are now voting. The
voluntary voting system just
wouldn’t work here at Davidson,
and there’s no way to compel any
student to vote who doesn’t want
to vote.

Since the Davidson students have
to come together in chapel, that is
the most logical and easiest place
to take a vote which would have
a good representation. It seems
therefore, that chapel is the most
desirable place for elections under

the circumstances. The main prob-
lem then is to adjust the elections
to chapel.

It is an admitted fact that elec-
tions for all the officers at David-
son take a long time. This year,
with three chapel periods a week,
instead of the four which we had
last year, voting will be further
handicapped. The only solution to
this would seem to be to start. the
nominating earlier and streamline
the election process. One consola-
tion, however, is that the revised
constitution, which was adopted
last year, eliminates several elec-
tions which were previously held in
chapel. The YMCA elections, for
example are now held out of
chapel. This will help a great deal,
but the problem of time is still
an acute one.

Another possible way to
down on the time required for elec-
tions, would be for the Student
Council to elect the Elections Board
earlier than it has done in the past,
thus taking advantage of all pos-
sible time in our chapels. The Elec-
tions Board conducts all elections.
It counts, files, and posts all elec-
tion returns as soon as possible
after the polls are closed. This
year, the Student Council will elect
the Elections Board earlier, which
will make possible an earlier start-
of the student* elections. This
year’s Board will count and record
the ballots on time, and do it in an
orderly and official manner. One

VESPERS HIT

Dear Editor:

The Sunday Vesper services are
intended to play an important part
in the religious life on this cam-
pus. I like to think that the com-
pulsory attendance at these serv-
ices is designed to place men in
the position, either with an eager
willingness consciously or with a
begrudged presence unconsciously,
to take advantage of the insights
into our spiritual life and growth,
as offered by the Vesper speakers.
No doubt, the services have, in the
past, and are now, in some cases,
fulfilling this role. But I am of
the opinion that the vesper services
of this year are falling short of
their potential to affect our spirit-
ual life.

1 am not questioning the individ-
val worth of these speakers or their
right to the honor of sddressing
the Davidson student body at a
Sunday vesper service. | am ques
tioning the right of these speakers
to be content with bringing to en
intelligent group of men the spirit-
val pablum, the warmed-cver Sun-
day morning sermons, liberally
spiced with anecdotes and poeme,
which we heve heard on recent
Sunday nights. It is wrong to think
that we can dictate subjects or ap-
proaches to subjects. tt is not
wrong, or presumptuous on our
part, to expect something that is
challenging, something thut smacks
of a certain spiritual depth. In this
respect, | do not feel that we are
being satisfied.

Every man has his own idea of
what constitutes a meaningful reli-
gious experience. There are those
of us who get more out of emo-
tional presentation; there are those
of us who get more out of sound,
logical reasoning; there are those
of us who get more out of a doc-
trinal emphasis. And I think that
we can agree that there are minis-

ters who differ in their strength in
these areas, just as we can agree
that there are ministers who are
more capable than others in ad-
dressing a group of college men.
Who makes the decisions regard-
ing the calendar of speakers for
our vesper services? There is such
a committee, but it affords no stu-
dent representation. This is a fail-
ure, it seems to me, to maintain a
finger on the pulse of the student
body in a matter of such import-
ance as that of our spiritual life
and growth. And there are those
members of the student body whose
interest in the Sunday vesper ser-
vices goes beyond that of mere
compulsory attendance!

In conclusibn, I feel that there
is the need to seek men who will
confront us with a vital and chal-
lenging religious experience, to
set up the calendar of speakers in
time to allow these men to pre-
pare a message of such calibre,
and to feel out the interested mem-
bers of the student body concern-
ing ministers who might be ob-
tained.

Better Off Dead?

Dear Sir:

Allow me to take issue with your
Position regarding the Court of
Control. As the devil’s advocate
(i.e., the freshman's) I have some
questions and some suggestions. In
your editorial of November 11 (See
A Plea For The Court, Davidsonian
November 11, 1955), you did not
seriously consider the possibility
that the court would be better off
dead than alive. Please do.

What useful purpose can you
honestly say the court serves? We
like to think that it matures ‘fresh-
men by making them more like
ourselves. Even if we upperclass-

cut.

criticism that has been thrown at *
the Elections Board is that it is so
rushed for time after chapel that
there is a disorganized state of af-
fairs while the ballot counting is
taking place. A possible remedy
for this bad situation would be to
have the entire Elections Board
meet in the afternoon of the voting
day and count the votes. By meet-
ing in the afternoon instead of
immediately after chapel, the Board
would have plenty of time to do a
thorough and orderly job.

The poor distribution of the bal-
lots has also been criticized. If the
whole student body is voting on
the same office, identical ballots
‘should be handed out at the back
doors; while if a class vote is in-
volved, separately printed ballots
should be used.

Perhaps the introduction of a
nominating committee would end
the necessity of signing up by the
candidates, but whatever the case,
this is definitely an area where
some type of reform is needed.

The Student Council is now un-
dertaking to institute a more ef-
fective elections system at David-
son, and helped by the suggestions
of Gayle Averyt, last year’s Elec-
tions Board President, Dean Spen-
cer, and others, the Student Coun.
cil hopes to be the voice of the
Davidson Students in effecting
needed changes in our elections
system.

SKIDS -

men are paragons that freshmen
ought to imitate, how effective has
the court been in the past in bring-
ing this about. You will remember
that even in the days of Good
Judge Barry freshmen were still
freshmen, and you were one just
as I was. Would our character have
been much worse today if there had
been no court?

There is, of course, our college's
Tradition, before which you pros-
trate yourself every Friday night.
When a school does not haye size,
tradition is vital. But veneration of
tradition can get out of hand, as !
think it has in your case, when the
maintenance of a kangaroo court
is justified on the grounds that it
has been in existence for a number
of years,

I have difficulty believing that
you are interested purely in the
freshmen’s own good. Aside from
traditional motives, then, why do
you want to continue with the
court? Does their insubordination
disturb you? Why should 3 fresh.
man be subordinated to an upper-
classman in the first place? Of
course I will not deny that fresh-
men are pitifully immature as a
class, but can you consider the
very idea of a Court of Control ex-
pression of a mature mind?

For the sake of honesty why
don’t you throw out the rot about
tradition and improving the im-
mature and so forth, and admit
that it’s fun to haze freshmen. If
you think that is worthy enough a
reason for prolonging the court.
then go ahead, but please keep
your true motive ready at hand in
case someone asks why you are
doing it. If not, why not hereafter
cover your newsprint with some-
thing more edifying than the pom.
pous fraud in last week’s David-
sonian.
