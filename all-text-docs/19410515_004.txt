’Cats Blanked
On Va. Jaunt

Wednesday afternoon, May 7, the
varsity baseball squad left to play
a three game schedule in Virginia.
The first game was with Virginia
Military Institute, the next against
Washington and Lee, and the last
with the Tigers of Hampden Syd-
ney.

Rutherford Spessard, starting his
first game of the season for the
Virginia Cadets, limited the David-
son College baseball team to three
little singles and the Cadets went
on to: blank the Cats 11-0. Carter,
lanky first baseman for the Cats,
obtained. two. of--their. three hits.
Cartlett was the leading hitter for
the Cadets, getting a sharp single,
a‘smashing double, and a home
run.

After the team had spent the
night at V. M. I, they journeyed
over to the Washington and Lee
park to encounter the supposedly
strong General attack. John Ligon,
finding the Cats to his liking, struck
out sixteen men and yielded only
two hits, while-his teammates were
pounding Morris and McLeod for
a total of five hits and six runs.
Morris, starting off a bit shaky, was
relieved by McLeod at the begin-
ning of the fourth, The imperturable
McLeod gave up only one hit for his
five innings of twirling.

Being very much discouraged
over their journey thus far, Coach
Shephard pitted his lanky ace pitch-
er, Lucas, to face the Hampden
Sydney Tigers. Lucas and Wood,
Tiger pitcher, playing before an es-
timated-crowd of a thousand people,
hooked up in a neat pitcher’s duel

with Wood finally emerging the
victor. Lucas pitched good ball but
lacked the support of his team-

mates and the Cats were defeated
4-1.

Shelton, keystone sacker for the
Tigers, led the batting attack with
three singles for four trips.

Davidson’s baseball team will
meet the Red Raiders from North
Carolina State today and tomorrow
afternoons at the Richardson Field.

The time is 3:30.
