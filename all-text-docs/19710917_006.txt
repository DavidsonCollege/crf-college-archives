There it was. sitting squarely in the middle of my
desk blotter. I could guess without looking at it what it
would be. 1 was right: it was a note from Joe Earle ask-
ing me to do a story on the coed soccer managers.

“Here we go again!” 1 thought. Another one of those
biggy assignments. I had almost mastered the style of writ-
ing about coed cross-country managers and tennis work-
study boys last vear, so this task appeared to be a snap.

There was one catch to the matter. To the eloquent
note. Joe had appended their words: “try to be different.”
How is the world can you be different about something
like this?

Anyway. Tuesday afternoon I wandered down to watch
soccer practice. anxious to meet two new friends and hop-
ing they would tell me enough to make the story readable.
Joe likes stories that are readable.

Well. I introduced myself as being from THE DAVID-
SONIAN and their anguished cries told me that was my
first mistake. We seated ourselves on the bank and they
proceeded to inform me of the basic biographical informa-
tion which is normally the meat of such stories.

Both girls are sophomore students from Mary Bald-
win. they are history majors and they hail from Charles-
ton. S. C

Realizing that a good provocative question was need-
ed next. I asked them what their duties as managers en-
tailed. “We keep track of the eligibility papers for the
boys. we make publicity posters and we take orders from
Kim Jones. our immediate boss.’ commented Marie Fer-
rara.

At this juncture. Jones called for an ink pen which
Jennet Robinson hurled in his general direction.

Resuming my poignant line of questioning. I asked
them how they got interested in soccer.

Marie derives her love of the sport from being a cheer-
leader for football and soccer in high school, and she broke
into a rousing chorus of “GO WAHUS GO,” apparently
indicating a few visits to UVa.

Jennet is also a fan of the sport. noting that “this is
my first time in college that I've had a home team to yell
for.”

I couldn't let the interview end without asking the
most relevant question of all—‘‘Why are you here?” Jen-
net was quick to. point out that they were fed up with
hearing that question. and she related one incident in
which she triumphed over an astute Davidson student who
asked her, “Are you a coed?”

“You're verv observant,” she replied.

“Why did you come to Davidson?” he queried.

“To find a husband.” she shot back, ‘and vou look
like a prime candidate.”

She admitted that she had been wanting to do that
for some time. and simply could not resist when the stu-
dent fell into the trap.

Well. that ended the interview—almost.

Each girl is extremely excited about the scrimmage
Sunday afternoon at,2 p.m. which will find the Wildcats
hosting the Charlotte.Soccer Club on Sprunt Field.

Marie came up with the following suggestion: ‘Why
don't you let us write our own story about the match in-
stead of boring everyone with all these retails which make
us sound like Bobsey twins?”

Realizing the dire need for something different in
the sports pages. I readily agreed to their proposal. Joe
also agreed iin fact, he relished the thought), so next
week Marie and Jannet will contribute their own story
about what it’s like to be managers. .

Freshmen To Run Tuesday

It can be very hard to change
a tradition at Davidson, parti-
cularly one that has lasted for
35 years.

The freshman cake race is a
tradition that withstood any ef-
fort to be changed.

The race was initiated in 1935

es decided that it was not nec-
essary this year because of the
quality of the cross-country
team.

But the race has become a
regular feature in the opening
of every school year.

by track coach Heath Whittle.
in an effort to discover poten-
tial cross-country runners in
the freshman class.

The race will be run Tuesday
afternoon at 4:15 on the soccer
field.

Originally it was scheduled
for last Tuesday, but the coach-

It has become a popular ev-
ent with faculty wives, the don-
ators of the cakes, and a vivid
memory for the students that
have run it.

Martin expects to have about
80 cakes, roughly the number
from last year, donated as
prizes in the 1.7 mile marathon.

Deacons Outlast Wildcats
With Fourth Quarter Win

AN ANALYSIS

By Frank Soos
Staff Writer

“A great fight.’ said Wildcat
coach Dave Fagg of his team’s
effort in their 27-7 loss to Wake
Forest last Saturday night.

The ‘Cats, preseason picks
for the lower ranks of the con-
ference, held the Demon Dea-
cons scoreless for three per-
iods. The perturbed Deacons
had their sights set on their
second straight ACC title. Lots
of luck, guys.

As for the Wildcats, Fagg
praised their defensive execu-
tion as flawless. The Wake of-
fense was powerless after reel-
ing off a eighteen yard run on
the game's opening play.

Linebackers Woody Montgo-
mery, Robert Norris and Jim-
my Hardison consistantly con-
tained the deadly veer offense
and option-master Larry Rus-
sel. Co-captain Montgomery’s
performance earned him con-
ference defense man of the
week.

Davidson scored on their first
attempt in eleven plays from
their own 49. Running back
Johnny Ribet chewed up yard-
age on the ground while Scotty
Shipp tossed two passes to Rich-
ard Neal, including the touch-
down.

Half time festivities in *‘Dea-
con-land,” as the announcer
charmingly put it, included a
plaque presentation to the R.
J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
for their service to Wake For-
est U. and all humanity. A ply-
wood chapel surveyed the cere-
mony benignly from the end-
zone.

The punting game proved to
be the greatest weakness in
the Wildcat attack. Shipp’s sev-
en punts averaged almost 34
yards and were high. The down-
field coverage was just not
there.

Wake Forest was able to re-
turn the ball well into ‘Cats
territory, putting pressure on
the defense and at the same
time forcing the offense to fol-
low a more conservative at-
tack. Gradually the defenders
were worn down, receiving lit-

tle rest the entire third quar-
ter. .

The Deacons failed in a field
goal effort from the nineteen,
but still managed to keep the
‘Cats against the wall. Finally
they scored on the second play
of the fourth quarter.

Wake fans finally rose to their
feet (after three quarters of
pleas from Deacon head cheer-
leader, winner of the coveted
broken megaphone award for
most obnoxious preformance by
an opposing cheerleader, (ref.

previous winner Duke b-ball
game, Jan. 1970) that were ac-
tually more of a dramatic mon-
ologue) only to find themselves
still behind as the ball rebound-

ed from the goalpost. David-
son still led.
From then on. the Wildcats

were plagued with errors. They
suffered their only two. pen-
alities of the night, were inter-
cepted twice and once more
allowed good punt run-backs.
Wake Forest capitalized on
each opporutnity.
