The DAVIDSONIAN. May 29, 1915

i915 “QUIPS AND CRANKS.”

‘Vhe carping critics and Jeramaic
mourners wno were bewailing tne delay 4

ino arrival of the 1915 Annual founu
themselves utterly suienced when “Quips
and Uranks appeared on the scene Last
ihursday.

for nine_ months editorial, art and
business staff have been toiimy earnestly
over this annual production, and thougn
not a secret was given out, yet the mys-
tery and anticipation on tne faces otf
thuse who knew, led the campus to ex-
pect great things in the end. ahat there
were none disappointed, and that every-
one was delighted, was evidenced by the
praise heard on every hand as soon as
the Annuals were given out.

The volume of nearly two hundred
pages 1s bound in beautitul brown leath-
er. Inside the artistic torm and arrange-
ment is as perfect as is ever seen.

‘The Annual. opens with a dedication
to Dr. Walter L. Lingle, President of
the Board ot ‘lrustees, “one ot the
staunchest friends of the college.” “Vhe
Senior section which follows stands out
from the rest of the book by reason of
its individual style of paper and photo-
graphs. Not only are the Seniors’
features shown, but also their charac-
teristics and peculiarities by word and
cartoon.

The lower classes come next, and the
pictures of the various athletic teams,
fraternities, clubs and organizations fol-
low in order. Interspersed between all
these are cartoons, wit, prose and poetry.
Every phase of college life, every light
and shadow, the funny and the grave,
all have their place.

Throughout the volume, the drawing

and cartoon work of Minter and Good
stand out in excellence. ‘The photo-
raphs and group pictures are splendid-
y clear and well arranged. These, of
course, are intensely interesting to not

only every student, but also the friends

of Davidson, and especially to “the girl,

to whom the Annual brags for you.” as

the editor says.

The prose part has been said by many,
including alumni who visited Davidson
Commencement, to be the best of any
Annual that Davidson has ever sent
out. The calendar, written as the diary
of a green but wide-awake Freshman,
is a rare compendium of the fun of a
whole year, and roaringly humorous all
through. “Our Little Ones” consists
of twenty short letters in “Christian Ob-
server” stvle, but Mark ‘Twain spirit,
from “our little folks of the campus,”
Willie Winn, Pookie Austin, Albert
Wood, Mary Crisp, Laata Law, and
others. “Davidson College” comes on
the heels of this, a ten page parody on
the catalogue, describing the various
buildings and scenes of Davidson and

various distinguished personages con- N

nected with. them, in hardly compliment-
ary, but rich and ridiculous style.
Space forbids a mention of more of
the excellent features. Too much praise
cannot be given to the Editor and Chief,
cllwaine, and his helpers, and
to the Business Manager, J. E. Faw,
who despite the hard year and his other
strenuous duties, piloted successfully the
all-important business side.

MR. JACKSON WILL SPEND
SUMMER IN DAVIDSON

_, Mr. F. L. Jackson, Bursar of Dav-
idson, is planning to remain at David-
son during the summer. He will direct
repair work that will be done, keep in
touch with prospective students, and
work in his office.

Mr. Jackson's splendid work fdr the
college was mentioned by Dr. Lingle on
Commencement Day. Not in a conspic-
uous manner, but slowly and surely he
is making changes for good on the cam-
pus: and placing the business of the col-
ege upon a strong foundation.

By his boyish sympathies, and genial,
Christian personality, Mr. Jackson has
won himself a host of friends amon
students and townspeople. His work is
not as often recognized as that of others
but it is none the less appreciated and
valued by those who know.

LIBRARY RECEIVES
HISTORIC TEXT-BOOK

A recent contribution made to, the
Library by Prof. J. L. Douglas, which
Davidson
students, is an algebra by Maj. D. H.
Hill, who was professor of mathematics
and civil engineering at Davidson from

of Algebra,” was regarded highly by
most teachers of that period. It was
once referred to by James G. Blaine
ing one of his famous debates in the
Senate. A curious thing about this
book is that throughout it exhibits many
examples of strong sectional feeling, a
feature very startling in view of the ex-
tremely impersonal nature of mathemat-
ics. Stonewall Jackson, himself a profes-
sor before the Civil War, refers to the
book in very high terms. He says: “I re-
gard it as superior to any other work
with which I am acquainted in the same
branch of science.” That the great
Stonewall Jackson should have spoken
of it in such a manner is proof suffi-
cient of its merit. Beside this book
Major Hill was the author of several
others, most of which were on religious
subjects. Among these were “The Ser-
mon on the Mount” and “The Cruci-
fixion of Christ.”

MAY MAGAZINE APPEARS.

The last number of The Davidson
College Magazine for the year appeared
the 15th. On the whole it is a very
creditable issue and contains some good
articles, Ot the three pieces ot poetry,
“Juse A-wearvin® I6r You,” a bit of
romantic verse written in’ semi- James
Whitcomb Rilev style, is probably the
best. “Life has a strong and hopeful
swing.

“A ‘Tropical Romance” opens
prose list. ‘Phe Romantic Imagina-
tion,” which the writer believes himself
cursed with, makes him hear the ardent
love-making ot two savages as he glides
along the Malampoosa in his canoe.
He is startled to find after a long reverie
that the chattering comes from two
chimpanzees.

The same writer follows with an in-
teresting and delightfully written article,
“A France of Enthusiasm,” in) which
he pictures the French war spirit as he
saw it last summer. ‘loo much praise
cannot be given to G. W. Gignilliat for
his splendid contributions to the Maga-
zine this year. “John Charles Mc-
Neill.” the other essay of the issue, is
thoughtful and well-phrased.

“Love and Duty” is a story centering
around the missionary ideals .of two
young lovers. “Laleila” is an Indian
story simply and interestingly told.

The Magazine is closed with a strong
editorial by the editor, U. §. Alexander,
on “The Past and the Future.”

The Magazine needs and deserves
wider and heartier support in the stu-
dent body. If this is assured, The Dav-
idson Magazine will rank among. the
best in the South next vear.
