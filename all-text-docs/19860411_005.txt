Woodward paints color of nature in exhibit

By KAT LEHMAN

For those of you who have vis-
ited the Gallery lately, you un-
doubtably have been pleasantly
surprised and enlightened in the
world of color by Davidson
graduate Kes Woodward. The
exhibit runs concurrently with
Woodward’s other exhibition
“The Birch Portrait Series” which
is being shown at Jerald Milberg
Gallery in Charlotte.

Woodward’s paintings on
paper are of birch and spruce
trees. However, because of the
techniques Woodward uses, each
tree is unique in color, line and
shape. The way he applies the
paint (texturing the painting)
lends greatly to the abstract nature
of his work.

The first work, “Seattle Birch
No. 5” (1985), like all of the
works in this exhibit, is oil and

It seems that the most popular
word used to describe The New
Prague Trio is “perfect.”

This is, after all, the word
which pops up time and again in
reviews from publications such as
Switzerland’s La Liberte, (‘The
interpretation was so high that one
could just say perfect’) and
Cairo’s Journal d' Egypt (“A per-
fect chamber music group.”)

Indeed, it was this trio’s very
perfection of performance which
gave it the opportunity to leave
Czechoslovakia for its American
debut this spring. As only the very

paper. His use of negative space

‘and color is striking. Woodward

intends to show us nature fully,
not merely as forms, but as color,
line and emotion. In “Seattle
Birch No. 5” all of these elements
are present.

The next portrait, “Three
Trees,” is numbered I, IT, III, de-
Signating the various stages of
time. The first piece is portrayed
during the day which gives the
painting the aura of calm and
mightiness. The second of the
series depicts the early evening
and results in a restful and peace-
ful atmosphere. Painting HI, de-
picted at night, emphasizes the
mystery surrounding the forest.

Some other notable pieces are
“Birch Portrait No. 47” (1986),
“Birch Portrait No. 44” (1986),
“Two Trees II” (1986), “Two
Trees HP’ (1986), and “Fabulous

countries are allowed to tour in the
West, Davidson was treated to a
first-class performance when the
Trio played last night in the 900
Room.

The New Prague Trio was
founded in 1970 at the Prague
Academy of Arts and has since
won superlatives in competitions
such as the 1976 International
Piano Trio Competition in Bel-
grade and the Czech Interpreters
Competition in 1971. In 1982 it
was also presented with the annual
prize of the Czech Association of
Chamber Music.

Spruces I, II, and III’ (1986).
“Birch Portrait No. 47” shows an
intensity of color that makes the
viewer think long and hard about
exactly what these trees look like.
The interaction of the trees creates
a dialogue between them and the
negative space. This creates an ef-
fect of intensity which causes the
viewer's eyes to come full circle
around the painting.

Another painting “Birch Por-
trait No. 44” also has this effect
with its patches of dark grey ba-
lanced against lighter greys, areas
and pines. This also results in an
intriguing intersection of shape
and color.

The “Fairbank’s Spruces”
series are unlike his other paint-
ings in subject matter and tech-
nique, They are not as interesting
as his birch portraits because the
birch portraits are so rich in color,

Jan Zvolanek on violin cello per-

compositions by Franz Joseph
Haydn, Dmitri Shostakovich and
Antonin Dvorak. Each artist was
an exceptionally talented musi-
cian and it was this individual tal-
ent which made The New Prague
Trio so extremely entertaining.

Violinist Klika carried the
majority of the melodic lines

Trio No. 25 in G Major) while

texture, line and shape that the
spruce trees seemed flat in com-
parison. However, unlike the rest
of his paintings, ‘“Fairbank’s
Spruces III” (1986) is effective in
its refinement of color and vari
ety.

Friday, April 11, 1986

The exhibit is one that is calm
and reassuring rather than violent.
Woodward's pieces are beautiful
and they show us a rare side of
life. The exhibit will be on display
until April 18 in the Gallery.

A work from Davidson’s permanent collection

New Prague Trio performs perfectly

rising to the fore. An excellent ex-
ample of Zvolanek’s virtuosity
came in the Andante section of
Shostakovich’s Trio No. 2 in E
Minor where he employed har-
monics to expand the natural
range of his instrument. Pianist
Strizek displayed an extremely
wide range of talents throughout
all these selections, alternating
between subtle backdrops and in-
credible leads to act as a perfect
complement to the other two art-
ists. Communication between the
musicians was also superb, allow-
ing for exact timing and rhythm.
The New Prague Trio defi-
nitely gave one of the best

Chamber Music Series perfor-
mances of the year. In a word,
“perfect.”

One interesting note: The
three compositions performed
Thursday night were not chosen
randomly. In fact, the selection
was tailor-made for a Western au-
dience by the Czech government.
Haydn's Trio is a variation on a
Czechoslovakian folk song (aptly
named Gypsy) and Shos-
takovich’s Trio (written in 1944)
is a celebration of the proletariat
class as well as an expression of
the suffering at the hands of and
victory over the Nazi's in World
War II.

Spring Frolics food- Gilio’s:Great pasta

By TREY JAMMES

What would Spring Frolics be with-
out an outstanding dinner? Not much,
and unfortunately that often means a
large bill. However, if you do not mind
going without some of the ambiance of
the more expensive restaurants, an excel-
lent dinner can be enjoyed at a relatively
low cost. For those looking for the night
of a lifetime I will also include a brief
summary of some of the most expensive
restaurants in Charlotte.

If you are looking for good food with-
out having to pay for ambiance, check
out A.W. Shucks or Gilio’s. The decor at
A.W. Shucks features a rough interior
with a peanut-shell-littered barroom
floor. However, the floor is almost
straight and most of the chair legs touch
the floor. If the conversation is strained
don’t worry, a train is sure to zip by soon
and drown it out anyway.

Actually the decor is perfectly suited
for the food; it is hard to look dignified
with crawdads hanging out of your
mouth. The food, although slightly

messy, is excellent. The shrimp creole is
spicy and has big, fresh shrimp is it. If
you are adventurous then the steamed
oysters are an excellent choice, and don’t
say you hate them until you have tried
them.

A.W. Shucks is located on 6051 Old
Pineville Road, 525-3738 is the number
but reservations are not necessary.
Shrimp creole costs $10.95 and a large
bucket of oysters is $8.95.

Gilio’s could be mistaken for
Quincy’s on the outside, however once
you have tasted the pasta you know you
are in a great place. The pasta and sauces
are made on the premises. These fresh in-
gredients are used to create dishes that are
as good or better than those at more ex-
pensibe restaurants. My favorites are the
fettucine and lasagna. J have not tried the
stromboli, but I have heard that its com-
bination of cheese, meatballs and tomato
sauce is fantastic. Gilio’s has also re-
cently started serving pizza which, if it
follows the Gilio’s tradition, should be

excellent. An added bonus is that all en-
trees are under $5.00. Of course a bottle
of wine or a few imported beers add to the
cost, but it is still the best value in all of
Charlotte. Gilio’s is located on 5135 Al-
bermarle Road. Call 568-0000 for more
information, but reservations are not nec-
essary.

For those looking for a restaurant that
is a little more traditional, try Clifford’s.
This is the perfect elegant restaurant that
will not break your budget. It has a varied
continental menu that has something for
everyone and the entrees range from $7 to
$15. Their most popular dishes are a vari-
ety of styles of veal and steaks. There
speciality is Steak Au Poivre which your
waiter will be able to describe better than
I. Cap off your meal with some zebra pie,
the best of their many fine desserts.

Clifford’s is located on Carmel Road
at Quail Hollow Road. Reservations are
recommended, 541-0525.

Of course, there are some of you who
are not looking for an inexpensive dinner

but rather an evening to remember. This
calls for a restaurant that produces a mild
sense of euphoria. Slugs 30th Edition is
one such place. It maybe the altitude be-
cause the food is not the best in Charlotte,
but it definitely is an unforgettable ex-
perience.

Reflections at the Radisson Plaza
Hotel is another restaurant with the per-
fect surroundings for you and your date.
The food is excellent, albeit expensive,
and the menu ranges from Northern Ita-
lian to Cajun.

The Lamplighter is another romantic
place to take your date. Locate in a
1920's home on 1065 East Morehead
Street the excellent beef and seafood is
complimented by quiet musie~ All of
these restaurants require reservations.

There are many fine restaurants in
Charlotte and this article just scratches
the surface. However, it ought to give
you some idea of the variety of restau-
rants from which to choose. Next Week:
Even more adventurous restaurants.
