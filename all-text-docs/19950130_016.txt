Wildcats cheer for tradition

’ By Joe Beach & Jason Burt

Once again we have been
amazed by the spirit and enthusi-
asm of the average Davidson bas-
ketball fan. To each and every one
of you who attended the game both
Monday against Appalachian State
and Saturday against Marshall —
thank you.

Believe it or not, you played
an instrumental role in lifting the
Wildcats to the victory over the
Mountaineers. Although ASU is
not expected to shake up the South-
ern Conference this year, they al-
ways seem to have our number (as
evidenced by the four-game losing
streak we had against them going

into last week’s game).

Speaking as fans, we can’t say
enough about how good it feels to
stand in the midst of a roaring
crowd and watch our conference
foes fall before our team. Speak-
ing for the players, they really do
appreciate the effort and energy
you expend at our home games.

We think that we are well on
the way to constructing our “House
of Horrors.”

This week, both the men’s and
women’s teams will be putting in
the miles as they travel to meet
varying conference foes. The
women travel to Marshall tonight,
while the men will swing by Geor-
gia Southern tonight before return-

selection as the preseason player
of the year.

The Wildcats are going toneed
your help in what could very well
prove to be a preview of action to
come in the postseason. Make
your plans now, and be sure to
include in them thé most exciting
basketball action this side of the
Charlotte Coliseum.

We’ dlike to add just one more
word — about tradition. Over the
past four years, we have been wit-
ness to Davidson’s efforts to resur-
rect what was once a great basket-
ball program. The result has been
a system that has risen from a me-
diocre Big South team to a power-
house in the Southern Conference.

Women’s hoops still
scraping for conf. win

By Jonathan Whitcomb

The women’s basketball team
ran into Southern Conference lead-
er East Tennessee State Saturday,
and the Buccaneers played like it
in the second half.

After staying within 39-35 at
halftime, the Wildcats couldn’t
keep with ETSU and left Johnson
City, Tenn., still searching for their
first conference victory.

Carolyn Kirsch led Davidson
(4-14, 0-6 Southern) with 16 points,
and Elizabeth DuBose added 12
points and six assists.

ETSU (13-4, 6-1) had five
players in double figures, led by
Amy Engle (19 points). Justina
McClellan had 17 points and ten
rebounds, while DeShawne
Blocker added 15 points and 17
rebounds.

Before last week’s losses to
Tennessee-Chattanooga and Geor-
gia Southern, the team finished up
their tough non-conference sched-

ule over the Christmas break and

began league play.In the first game,
at St. Francis, Penn., the Wildcats
had a tough first half in terms of
shooting, making only 25.8 per-
cent of their shots. They improved
some in the second half, as they hit
for 41.9%, but still lost on the road.
Kirsch and Jen Vanlerberghe led
Davidson with 11 points each.
Next, in Loyola, Md.,
Davidson fell behind by 15, and a
late rally came up shortas Davidson
lost 67-56. Kirsch again played

well, with 18 points and 13 re-
bounds.

The Wildcats finally returned
home, and the change of scenery
did them good as the team blew
away Charleston 77-57. In that
game, the Wildcats shot over 50
percent from 3-point land, Amy
Scalcucci led the charge with 21
points, and Kristen Ferucci added
15.

Against William & Mary,
Davidson hada strong second half,
but fell 83-65. Ferucci had 19
points, and Tonya Sharpe put in 17
for the game.

The Wildcats then opened
conference play on the road against
Furman, but lost 82-64. Davidson
was within two at halftime, but
Furman shot 55% in the second
period on the way to their victory.
Four Wildcats hit double figures,
led by Kirsch with 12 points.

In their next conference game
against Western Carolina,
Davidson lost a heartbreaker, 81-
77 in overtime. Western Carolina
only managed 24 points in the first
half, but sent the game into the
extra period, where it outscored
the Wildcats 14-10. Kirsch had a
double-double with 17 points and
ten rebounds, while DuBose had
12 and Vanlerberghe had 19.

The women’s team returns to
action tonight, playing on the road
against Marshall. The next home
game for the squad is Feb. 8 against
Furman.
