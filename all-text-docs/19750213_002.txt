Registrar and Mrs. Richard
C.: Burts Jr. announced the
births of their fourth and fifth
grandchildren Wednesday.

“I’m so thrilled. This is just
what we’ve wanted,” said Mrs.
Burts. “The twins look just like

The Burts Siamese twins
were tied at the hands.

The registrar expressed
dismay at the joining of the
twins.

“Separating twins tied at the
hands is no major surgical
feat,” said Burts, “but the Bur-
ts family have traditionally
been plagued with the inability
to looses our little pinkies.”’

The children were born at 1
a.m. “‘The worst things always
happen after midnight’’, said

Honors Students Canoe Rocky
With Hennis As. River Pilot

By GERALD TERHORST
Staff Writer

Students and faculty from the
Center for Honors Study took a
brown-water canoe trip up the
Rocky River yesterday to find
the major sources of pollution.
according to Professor of
Biology David C. Grant.

“We took samples all along
the way to determine what life
does exist in the stream,”’ Grant
said.

““We found none.”

The group began paddling 50
yards below Laundry Creek and
disembarked in the center of
Mooresville.

Several students remarked
that it would have been easier to
paddle downstream, but Dean
of the Center for Honors Studies
Earl R. MacCormac disagreed.

“Our research was pretty
conclusive that the Rocky
flowed downstream.”’ said Mac-
Cormac. “‘I figured we'd better
head upstream if we were going
to find out where the dirty
water was coming from.

“Besides, its time honors
students stopped getting down
in the mouth about hard work
and began using primary sour-
ces,’ MacCormac said.

The group was encouraged by
college efforts to clean up the
stream. The group had high
praise for Director of the

Physical Plant Grover C.
Meetze’s solution for the laun-
dry effluent.

“The college is doing its part
to clean up the river by dum-
ping in all the soap suds from
the laundry,” said Grant.

“I got to take a bubble bath,
said Nancy Petrowski, one of

- the students along for the ride.

River navigator H_L. Hennis
steered the group safely
through the laundry effluent.
“It was the only place along the
whole river that was high
Tide,’ said Hennis. ‘‘For-
tunately, I know this stretch of
the river well, so I kept us away
from all the bars,’’Hennis said.
“IT read all about it ina book.”

After six hours of paddling.
the group had advanced. ten
yards against the tremendous
current. The group decided to
stop for an honors center lunch
at one o'clock. Hennis had eaten
all the ham, so the rest of the
group had to settle for tuna fish
sandwiches.

After the lunch and a talk by
little Charlie Shepherd in Hindi
about Indian canoeing, the
group proceded. The canoe
speed was much faster as all
the students began paddling in
the same direction.

No signs of life were spotted
by the group until they paddled
the canoes into the Mooresville

Waste Treatment Plant settling

“I got us through the rapids
all right, said Hennis, “‘but
those activated sludge stirrer-
uppers digested all our pad-
dies.’

The canoes capsized near
the chlorinators.

“I've never had such a bad
reception in my life,”’ said Mac-
Cormac, coming up for
aeration. ‘‘We were treated like

forms is Feb. 21, at 5 p.m.
in the Registrar’s office.

“All forms must be ready for
the computer to process when
the baby is christened’, said
Burts.

Students protested that .this
gave them too little time to con-
sult with their advisors, but
Burts said he was unable to
allow for an extension.

“My hands are tied’, said
Burts. ‘‘The baby had been
delayed an extra week while the
forms were being prepared for
distribution, but my daughter
agreed to the inconvenience to
give students the option of more
time.

“Certainly professors can
stand the slight time changes
and adjust their schedules to
meet with their advisees.”

Due to the money crunch
caused by the tuition freeze, the
traditional pink and blue
striped computer card forms
have been scrapped. The form
below must be cut out and filled
in.

“We haven't found out yet
who was the guilty mutt. But
then, there doesn’t seem to be
so many of them around here as
there used to be,’’ said Terry.

Dorothy Sherrill, R.N.,
Superintendent of the in-
firmary, was distressed and
confused.

“Craig came in last week
complaining of severe pains in
his left leg. We told him to take
two aspirin and get plenty of
sleep,” she explained.

Sherrill then made
Crosswhite an appointment to
come back in for a check-up in
six months, but he returned the
next night with ‘a bodacious
toothache’’ and _ extreme
nausea.

‘Then we figured it must be
bad,”* Sherrill continued. “They
usually don't come two days in
a row unless it’s real bad, you
know? Anyway, we kept on
feedin’ him those aspirin and
making him sleep, and it looked
like he was gonna pull through.
But I guess not.”’

Crosswhite is survived by
an uncle in Winesburg, Ohio,
= about half of his freshman

“Sure, I remember the first
time I saw Craig,” recalled a
former hall mate, Jerry
Mathers. ;

“We were meeting with our
hall counselors for the first
time and in walks this little guy

with red hair. But that wasn’t
Crosswhite. Anyway, a few .
other guys wandered in—right?
And finally this dumpy kid with
glasses... turned out to be a real
weird-o. That wasn’t him
either. ;

“Well, I’m sure Crosswhite

must have been. there
somewhere,’’. Mathers ex-
plained.

Another hall student from
Crosswhite’s freshman’ hall
remembers the “‘really far-out
games he used to think up.

“One was sorta like soccer
with a bowling ball. And I think
we used.to play Frisbee with
metal garbage can lids. Wow!
Say, have you got a match?

“One of the strangest things,”
he continded, “‘was the time he
bought a crossbow. Shot that
thing clean through the fire
door in the middle of the hall,
can you believe it? Yeah, that
was about the time we lost one
of the first off our hall: Wow!”

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan said, “I
remember Craig Crosshairs.
He was a good ol’ boy. Really
high caliber, I’d say.”

Registrar Richard C. Burts
Jr. explained, “I’m sorry, my
legs are tied.”’

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. said, “‘Who’s Craig
Crossbow?” ie

Crosswhite was not available
for comment.
