We Bid Farewell...

With this issue vour staff bids farewell.
and turns the newspaper over to a new re-
gime. The stati has enjoyed the task of
editing and publishing the weekly publica-
tion, despite the trials and ditticulties accom-
panying the. work,

The managing editors have made up their
respective pages admirably with the real
interest of the paper at heart. The copy,
teadet has done his work well. The sopho-
mores and freshmen, despite the paucity of
the latter, have dome their bit.

To the business staff goes the apprecia-
tion of che editorial staff. The business staii
has been the best in'many a year, due to the
excellent organization Manager Moore lras
brought about in his staff.

We have received the best co-operation
from the facuity advisor, the college ad-
ministration, the student body, and the town
in general. The Charlotte Observer and
the Charlotte News have aided the paper
immeasurably by giving the paper the use.
of their cuts.” Merchants in Davidson,
Mooresville, and Charlotte have shown their
interest in Davidson by their willingness to
advertise in the paper.

And lastly, the smooth running of the
newspaper this vear has been, to a large
extent due to ihe edficient work of ate
Standard Printing Company.

-Yes. the time has come ior the new re-
gime to step in, and it is al for the hest. A
new stafi.will imbibe the paper with a new
lite and a new zest. The new staff will car-
ry on with the matto ef The Davidsonian
“For A Better Davidson.”

To the New Editor...

You, Mr. Editor elect, have a considerable
job ahead of you. The way is not easy. The
firse thirty issues are the hardest. But ser-
iously, here is a bit of advice from a fcllow
newspaperman out west:—

“The college editor should make a slight
distinction between himself and his job.
_The job is important; he is not. The edi-
torship is as responsible a position, in its
potential power to help or harm the col-
lege as the presidency of the college.

The editor, unless he is a child prodigy,
must proceed thoughtfully and with due
regard for the errors of his predecessors
if he is properly to fulfill that responsi-
bility.

—The Daily Ilinois.

And when you have finished your task,
you will feel a sentiment akin to that ex-
pressed in this lite poem from our ex-
changes:

“What have. vou done?” St. Peter asked,

“That 1 should admit you lere?” :

“IT ran a paper,” the editor said,

“At my college for one long year.”

.St. Peter pityingly shook his head

And gravely touched the bell.

“Come in, poor man, select a harp .

“You’ve had your share of Hell.”

But the best ‘of luck to you, Mr. Editor-
elect, and your staff. May your success be
great and your difficulties few and far be-
tween!

Student Discord...

There has always been a lack of agree-
ment on some subjects between the faculty
and the students, and in most cases this has
been irritated by a lack of understanding.
Two things are definitely wrong.

First, there seems to be some inadequacy
in the communication of faculty rulings to
the students as individuals, and in the ex-
planation of these rulings. True, there may
still be a lack of agreement, if such condi-
tions are corrected, but the student can see
some reason then for disciplinary measures.
As it is the Davidson student usually feels
very much in the dark concerning faculty
rulings and their explanation. —

Second, when students feel disgruntled
and cannot agree, they have had no very
good way ,in the past to express their opin-
ion as a body directly to the faculty and dis-
cuss the differences.

Thus, we feel that the conference com-
mittee to be made up of three students and
three faculty members and to consider these
diftieulties, will fill a long sought need in
the handling of campus problems and will
aid nm the removal of the dissatisfied atmos-
phere which now pervades the campus,

At recent meetings of Omicron Delta
Kappa, the faeulty, in explanation of past
actions assured the members of the basis
for their decisions. When these same rea-
sons are brought to the ears of the student
body, we feel quite sure that there will be a
much greater understanding between the
two factions. °

Senior Slants

“On Compulsory Church Attendance”

The senior will remember the days in his
freshman history when it was possible for a
Student, even the treshman. to attend the
church of his liking, his own denomination.

. And, too. the senior who

did not attend his home

church was privileged to

sit where he pleased in
church.

But then the senior

- murmured something

about compulsory church

being distasteful, and it was not long after-.
ward that the senior was assigned a seat
betiad the freshmen.

The change was gradual but firms and
smooth enough that it passed along com-
paritively unchallenged. But this year’s
senior remembers that the senior of 1934
pleaded against compulsion, church attend-
ance even when he was allowed home church
permission and the privilege to sit as he
pleased. Now the plea is still the same but
under different conditions. We have been in
reverse for fout years. ~

Church attendance, hence religion, admit-
tedly has a purpose, admittedly a good pur-
pose. But the end of a good purpose is be-
ing attempted from the wrong angle. The
policy is contrary to all laws of human
conduet.

I-veryone realizes the sacriticial aim of r-
lgton, but it borders on becoming indigest
able when it is erammga down one's throat.

The whote frietion in the matter lies not
with the subject but with the principle.

Christian religion, according to its own
teachings, is an ideat, something to be de-
sired for its own sake and not something to
be driven to.

Then it would seem that the only and ob-
vious conelusion is that wader the present
conditions. church deteats its owm purpose.

The pity is that it could be placed onsa
far more attractive basis so that it would be
a real pleasure to attend church, so that it
would become @ tradition. Davidson would
be more proud to adaix that tt inad beeome
a tradition on the, Davidson campus that
every man attend church. -

NEW SUGGESTION

FOR SELECTING a
CAMPUS LEADERS...
Dear Editor:

While -alt the projects for help-
ing us elect our campus Jeaders
are being made, let me propose one.
Power should be given a committee
composed of the president, dean,
and the student body president to
select five nominees for each cam-
pus office. These men will be grad-
ed: three stars for Joe—he hasn't
ever held an office, but he made B
on psychology, and we feel that he
is well qualified; two stars for Bill
—he could hold an office all right,
but doesn't have the personality to
get it on his own hook; etc. But
don’t put the names of Sam, Dick,
or Jim on the ballot. They have
held enough offices and it is unfair
to all the other members of the
student body. No sirree — they're
on the shelf.

Silly, you say? Smacks of gram-
mar school? Certainly it does. But
it must be considered along with
similar plans which have been sug-
gested. A member of this, student
body is objecting because our lead-
ers hold more than one or two of-
tices. He feels that this is not fair.
He doesn't suggest, he SAYS that
Davidson College is guilty of let-
ting good personality and leader-
ship in previous offices play a part
in our voting. Tch, tch, how hein-
ous! He proposed that we use a
point system. Now .we all) know
what this means, because we re-
member our high school days. He
advocates a plan by which a group
of propagandists will say in effect:

Well now, Bill is a fine fellow,
was & wizard on the gridiron, has
made good enough grades to make
the Dean's list (and have you not-
iced that almost every Davidson

to John, who wants the job just

just deserts by some boy who has
fooled five other students into vot-
ing for him. This CONTROLLED

Northwestern University sororities have

has created a department of Amer-
ican civilization to train students
who wish to specialize in the de-
velopment of social and cultural in-
stitutions.

The course deals with American
literary, political, social and
nomic history and is described as

being in line “with the modern’
trend in education which breaks
down when necessary the tradi-

tional limits of university depart- :

in order to;

ments of instruction
meet the real needs of students.”
One of the features of the course
will be its stressing of the conflict
of ideas and means of determining
the rightness or wrongness of these
ideas. “When ‘authorities’ flatly
contradict each other or perpetuate

rumors as history, a university

which is older than the nation itself |

has a duty to present the truth from
the liberal rather than from a tory
or a radical standpoint,” one of the
course leaders stated. =

Rufus is a negro shoeshine boy

King For A

Day

CHUBBY KING

Without premonitory remarks,
joyfully and unhesitatingly, with
just a bit of pride, I tear- out a se-
cret from my burdened bosgm, now
harbored
months. My head tingles with de-

light — this is what is known as a

there for nigh three

scoop with ME as the perpetrator.
A fitting climax for such a disting-
uished literary career as mine. But
ah! Le scoop. Henry Wade Bar-
row, whose roommate is such an
excellent chap, will play the much
envied leading man in the exciting
drama of Marriage, co-starred with
lovely Miss Harriet Boyd of Co-
lumbia, S.C... . Engagement will
be announced this Sunday. (Ain't 1
ahead, people . . . Thanks, Har-
riet), ind wedding bells will peal
around second week in June...

Past week, campus saturated with
water, auto hagns, and gas... My
opinon that flare-up not due par-
ticularly to house party bereave-
ment, but rather the smoldering re-
sentment of a student body contin-
ually repressed. You can’t treat
mon like canines, and expect them
to do: anything other than bark.
(Occasionally, a bite, like Tuesday
night).

Listeners to WBT last Sat nite
entertained royally by the = rich
baritone voice of Colonel Liipfert
poetically phrasing sweet nothings
to anybody . .. Aromatous entry
of Spring evidenced everywhere
what with Ryburn's new Chicken
(astounding color motif) magazine,
and the Colonel broadcasting poe- |
try. Then, too, the unheard of reg-
warity of square dances conquering
the campus — the Big Apple has
vanished, and we return to the past
... At the Erwin dance — Coghill
and Porter chaperoning Miss Steel.
A variety of guests from Frieze to
Rybura.

Joe Kellam inaugurated spring
with a swing at some blue coats and
brass buttons, while Paul Cooper
playfully removed tickets from
autos — Dick Towill played the re-
trieving friend and they returned
safely . . . Henry Lyons, however,
in melancholy mood, pooch poos
spring, love and stuff — He's wear-

v

ing his heart-shaped pin again af-
ter an extended stay of the latter
in Salisbury ... Also, ask Lyons
for the “before” and “after” letters
of the Mid-Winters period — real-
ly a discerning study of contrast in
female attitude.

Billie Crooks after weeks of con-
templating WC Sat nite dance,
jailed in the infirmary, and was rep-

resented only by his flowers pre-
viously ordered . .. Sam Cothran
and Gus McNite in  compttitive
knock-outing with the fatter the
winner ... Bill Kiesewetter jour-
neyed“to Charlotte femme Monday
nite carrying my copy of very
Light Verse — featuring the better
amorous poems ... NOTICE! G,
Mathis in search of companion,
preferably female, to accompany
him on brief southern tour, length
unknown — probably just to $. C.

Walking upon the grass, espe-
cially now it’s spring, is fine stuff,
but let’s cut out this road breaking
.. Have noticed with considerable
chagrin, the paths created rather
recently — even thru the newly ap-
plied fertilizer, etc. .. . In other
words, if you walk upon the grass,
don’t walk the same way twice, and
we can eliminate the paths.

Vowles, Kunz, Harbin, Fred and
Skinny Lowrance off to Statesville
party Sat nite ... Gastiger mo-
mentarily coerced, but found
strength with one look at Miss
“Mitchell,” so locked himself up . .
Bill Hamilton and Dick Aycock
vied against each other for the fa-
vor of Miss Alice Reins ... Coot
Gladden returned to church with
Miss Martha Alexander while ex-
suitor Sadler smiled enviously ...
Heywood Hophead Hill charmed
by Pixy ... Catawba coed arranges
trip_north to coincide with that of
Don Cleveland... Frank Harrison
takes Punch from Glenn and en-
joys himself immensely ... Mon--
treat'’s—Miss Peggy Dietal—clect-
ed Miss Florida. ~ ~ '

EXPERIMENT—It would be in-
teresting for somcbody to take a
stop watch to church one night and
record the time it required for the
students to stand up and the time
it required for them to take their
seats again. They rise like it took
every ounce of strength in their
body and when allowed to sit down
again it’s like a dead weight falling
when the string is cut. Someone
said it’s only buman nature. Tom-
myrot; it’s laziness and nothing
else,

QUIET, PLEASE—Of the many
ministers that we have here for our
vesper. services there is one that
stands head and shoulders above
the rest when it comes to com-
manding attention from the student
body. {t is none other than our
own Dr. Foreman. Yes, when it
comes to receiving quiet respecting
attention Dr. Foreman is the man |

CHECKING UP—You have seen

that a soap company is giving away
in return for some soap wrappers.

entitled ‘Five Minute Biographies’
and the other night ‘Dirty Dan’
Walker was seen with one of these
books in one hand and a watch in
the other. When asked what he
was doing, he laconically replied:
