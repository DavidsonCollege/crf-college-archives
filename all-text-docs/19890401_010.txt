Fire Destroys Historic Chambers

Building

Plans For New And Better
Chambers Already Begun.

New Dormitory, Heating Plant,
Class Rooms, and _ Laboratory
Planned at Meeting Wednesday.

Before the ashes of old Chambers |

had given up their glow, while the
weathern-worn brick were still hot
from the effects of the terrible con- |
flagration which will forever be a}
vivid picture in “the minds of the
present students of Davidson, even}
before the flames had ceased to cur}
about the smouldering bits of tim-/
ber, plans were set on foot for the}
building of an appropriate edifice |
on that same site selected by the}
founders this institution many |
vears ago for the building which}
was destined to become the center)
of all college activities, and around |
which Davidson traditions were to
cluster for many decades. |
The first step was taken while the)
flames were mounting high about!
the falling roof of the old buniiding. |
The last futile effort had been made |
to save Chambers from total de-j|
struction, every bit of furnishings
and personal property which was
within reach had been removed from
the burning structure, and there re-
mained naught but to silently watch
the fast disappearance of the mas-
sive hall. A call came from Presi-
dent Martin and the student body as- |
sembled, the determination in their |
countenances being vividly brought |
out by the light of the flames.

Dr. Martin appealed to the siu-|
dents of Davidson to make the ter- |
rible disaster a thing of inspiration,
and to take this opportunity to make
the old college a “bigger and better |
Davidson.” He asked that the stu-
dents stand behind the faculty as one
man and that their courage never
flag. With heads bared, and with
the fire of determination in their
spirits, the body sang “O Davidson.”

A meeting of the faculty was-call-
ed at 9:30 o’clock on Monday and
plans were discussed for taking care |
of the homeless students, and for!
continuing the work, of the college
with the least possible interruption.

At 10:30 o’clock the student body
gathered in Shearer Hall, for the
purpose of meeting “the matter
squarely and to take definite steps
for the continuance of college activi-
ties and studies. Speeches were made
by faculty members, and students
sounded a note of optimism and de-
termination which immediately re-
moved any possible doubt that the
affairs of the college would go on as
though nothing had happened.

The Executive Committee of the
Roard of Trustees was summoned by
President Martin. They convened in
the president’s office in the fore-
noon of Wednesday, and the meeting
was continued through the after-
noon. These men took the matter
in hand and nothing will be left un-
done to place Davidson in a condi-
tion that will equal that of a week
ago, and even to forge ahead in a
campaign of improvement.

The Executive Committeemen
who were in attendance were: Dr.
Walter 'L. Lingle, of Richmond, Va‘;
Dr. L, T. Wilds, Lexington, N. C.;
Mr. R. A. Dunn, Charlotte; Mr. H.
N. Pharr, Gastonia; and Mr. John
P. Allison, Concord. ,

Definite plans for the rebuilding
of Chambers, or for the erection of
new buildings, are still in the course
of formation, but every effort will

Chambers As She Did Look.

Facts And Pounce On Chambers Building Taken From History

Of Davidson College

Construction Of Building Was Architectural Triumph in Early Days and Structure Was Great to The Day of Its Loss

The following facts and figures
about Chambers building were
taken from the History of-Davidson
College, compiled in 1920 by Miss
Cornelia. Shaw, Librarian, and pre-
sented to the college by her:

“As soon as the Chambers legacy
became available, came the erection
of the most imposing and perhaps
the largest college structure in the
state. The building was erected by
J. N. Scofield, of Davidson. The

nearest railroad at that time was 20
miles away. This fact made the col-

lection of stone, mortar and timber
a great undertaking. The founda-
tion and pillar stones were quarried
at Mt, Mourne, at Lover’s Leap, on
the Concord road, and in the Rocky
River -community. The lime was
mined at Little Mountain, across the
Catawba River. The heavy timbers
were cut at Huntersville, while the

planed lumber, coming from South ei

Carolina, was shipped to Charlotte

by train and hauled by teams to Da-
vidsom: The~ bricks were «made of
clay on the college land and were
burned’: where the “railroad*<water
tank now stands, sess

“The length of the building is 279
feet and its height, where crowned

‘by the cupola, is 95 feet. The splen-

did columns which make the build-
ing. distinctive in southern college

Entailing a money loss of over
$250,000 and an inestimable Joss. in
subjective valuation of one of the
South’s most historic college build-
ings, Davidson College was deprived
of the old Chambets building by fire
early Monday morning. The fire
was discovered shortly before 5:00
o’clock and the alarm given at once,
but the flames traveled rapidly and
were soon beyond the control of the
bucket brigade which was_ hastily
formed by students and townspeople.

Of the estimated $250,000. loss,
$100,000 was covered by insurance.
In the building were the department
of physics, including a lecture room
and several laboratories, equipped
with many very expensive instru-
ments; the museum; an old library;
five class rooms, and the dormitories
on the north and south wings of the
building accommodating about 135
students. Due to quick work by a
group of students and Dr. Douglas,
much valuable equipment was res-
cued from the physics laboratory.

One irreplacable and incalculable
loss was that of the old library,
which was-located on- the. second
floor. In this library were kept many
volumes of inestimable value. In the
museum were geological and’ bio-
logical specimens of rare interest.

Many students saved practically
all of their personal belongings by
hastily thrusting their clothes into
their trunks, rolling these trunks
down the stairs or throwing them
out of the windows, and then throw-
ing their books, bed clothes and oth-
er belongings out of the windows to
those waiting below to remove them
to safety. Students from other dor-
mitories rendered their unlucky
brothers much aid by entering dif-
ferent rooms and saving all they
could. Those who roomed next to
the stairways were unable to save
much, due to the fact that their
rooms were the first to be: attacked
by the flames. The onés who room-
ed in the north wing were also ham-
pered because this wing had only
one stairway, which was soon a mass
of flames, Many boys were forced
to climb to safety from the windows
and in doing this J. H. McKeithen
fell. from the third floor, receiving
only a slight injury, however,

As the fire was dying: down a
bugler sounded assembly, and the
students, coming from all directions,
some clad only in pajamas and bath
robes, lined ‘up in a body. Dr. W. J.
Martin made a ringing address; de-
claring that the spirit that had made
Davidson one of the strongest col-
leges of the South would assert it-
self in the midst of the catastrophe
and that an even greater: Davidson
would arise from the ashes of old
Chambers building. He then called
for a meeting of the faculty for 9:30
and of the student body for 10:30
o'clock, and stated that there would
be -no interruption of classes after
Monday. * He also said that arrange~
ments would be made immediately

for the housing of the unfortunates.

After Dr. Martin’s address, which
was heartily applauded, the students
stood with bared heads, singing “O
ead as an ipdieaticns rad their

ervid college spirit and loyalty,

The student body rally Ss Shearer
