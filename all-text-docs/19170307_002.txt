REFLECTIONS ON JUNIOR SPEAKING.

Junior Speaking has gone. ‘The
ladies have departed. ‘No longer do
the long halls of Chambers reverberate
the frightening yell Fire!" The Junior
is glad that the one dreaded milestone
of his college career is history. Now he
smiles when he meditates of that short
cycle, thru which he stood trembling,
pale, and nervous, before the eager re-
pository of his oratory—his audience.
He cares not whether his thot was of
interest to all—just so that time has
passed. For him he seems to enter upon
a new life. He resolves to do better
work—more work in literary society, at-
tain a greater proficiency in English
composition. This new life brings a
new purpose, a new intention. The
prospect for him is delightful—the walls
of his room are studded with gems—re-
flecting ravs of refulgence over his desk.
at which he has “boned"’ many a long.
weary hour. The Greek gods of the
wind are soon to dwell in the large
shades overspreading the curving walks.
The main drive is paved with gold. All
is glory.

Then he stirs—thinks of the next dav
of recitation in which he swings again
into the same routine. Thots of the Sen-
ior soecch grasps and covers his mind as
a sail boat is hidden and oppressed in a
fog. The forehead wrinkles—the eyes
grow large, once again the student is on
“his feet: and after all hours of study are
caging him in before the walls of the
creat college know him no more, and
which he must surmount before—with
“dip” in hand he starts upon a journey
of hoped-for bliss and prosperity.

JOINT MEETING ©
HELD SUNDAY

The Ministerial Band, the Voluntee-
Band and the Christian Endeavor So-
ciety held a joint meeting in Sheare:
Hall last Sunday evening at 6:45. The
meeting was conducted along mode’
Christian Endeavor lines. The subject
was “Service,” and G. C. Bellingrath
was the leader. After the discussion Mr
FE. M. Shepherd, of Winston-Salem, gave
a few rewarks. He urged each one to
take a special interest in the extension
‘vork of Christian Endeavor in the
South. Fowle, Coachman, Shields and
Tremain then favored the society with
some special music. The meeting was
closed after FE. H. Hamilton made an an-
nouncement about the Volunteer Con-
vention to be held in Greensboro on
March o-11. A number of the visiting
young ladies were present with their
escorts.

DAVIDSON STUDENTS
TO ATTEND CONVENTION

Those who are connected with the
North Carolina Volunteer Union, state
that plans for the Volunteer Convention
on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, in
Greenshoro, are now complete and that
Davidson will be represented by thirty-
four delegates. They will leave on the
noon train on Friday, and will return
Monday. At an open meeting durine
the convention four Davidson men. J.
R. Woods, W. Y. Sayad, E. H. Ham-
ilton and D. V. Hudson, will make
short addresses on phases of mission
work in which thev are interested.

UNCLE HTRAM'S GRAVE
SOON TO BE MARKED

The contributions of the students for
“Uncle Hiram’s” tombstone have been
raised as far as possible and have been
olaced in the hands of Dr. Martin. Dr.
Martin is going to select.a suitable stone
at Charlotte. probably a simole slab
with his name and other details. The
stone was given by the students in token
of their true sorrow at the death of one
who gave the best part of his life in the
service of the college. and one who held
the affection and esteem of all the stu-
dents.

TRAPPING IDEAS.

Every year at least half a dozen men
of national or international reputation
come to Chapel Hill to speak primarily to
the student body, They are generally
big men. with broad minds which they

have had focused for a long time on some} %
phase of literature. philosonhy, science

or some other branch of human
deavor.

en-

Thev come bringing to us fresh view-
points. broader outlooks. new ideas.

And vet at practically every lecture
there is plenty of standing room in Ger-
rard Hall, not to mention several empty
seats,

Tt may be true that all habits are bad.
hut if so the soine-to-lectures habit is
surely one of the feast evil. Tt is cer-
tainly more nrofitable and in both the
short run and the long run, more nlenc-
ant. than the staying-from-lectures habit
—Fx.

And they bring us the fruits!
of their thinking. They have something] f
to say and they know how to sav it./i
