'Tis the season to go bowling & FSU can start celebrating

_ By Will Cobb

Over Christmas break, the
unpredictable 1993 college foot-
ball season will come to a tearful
end. Seventeen Division I-A
schools will end with a victory, the
others with a defeat. Despite the
critics, the bowl system is the best
post-season structure for the sport.
Besides, every college football fan
would be bored silly during the
holiday season if they watched just
one game on the final day of the
season. Every New Year’s Day,
sports fanatics have been able to
christen the new year with at least
eight well matched college foot-
ball games from 11 a.m. till 11
p.m., at which times guys and their
friends eat and drink whatever they
prefer.

Unfortunately, the games this
year do not appear very well
matched, and there exists major
potential for some pretty serious
blowouts. Let’s hope, for the
viewer’s sake, I am proven wrong,
Just the same, for all 17 games,
here are my predictions, and for a
different twist, I’ll pick the losers:
*John HancockBowl: Oklahoma
vs. Texas Tech

The Sooners will take care of
business and will be home for
Christmas, Though the Big 8 is no
powerhouse, there’s only one
Texas team that belongs in a bowl,
and guess what?- it isn’t Texas
Tech. Will’s Loser: Tech by 16.
*eAloha Bowl: Colorado vs.
Fresno St.

The Buffaloes have had their
frustrations this year and are better
than their record shows. Fresno
State should find that out the hard
way. Will’s Loser: Fresno by 10.
Copper Bowl: Kansas St. vs
Wyoming

As far as this bowl goes on the
East Coast, who cares? But for
those enthusiastic football fans in
Wyoming and Kansas, here is what
I think. Lady luck shouldn’t need
to pull strings for this one, Kansas
State should come home with a
nice big trophy. Will’s Loser:
Wyoming by 18.

*Holiday Bowl: Ohio State vs.
BYU

DAVIDSON BASKETBALL PRESENTS:

This one is going to be tough
to watch. Hopefully, for the Mor-
mons, the game won’t get as ugly
as the 62-14 beating BYU took by
Texas A&M four years ago. What
Ohio State, a 9-1-1 team, is doing
playing a 6-5 team is beyond me.
This will be the first sure thing
blowout. Will’s Loser: BYU (at
the least) by 24.
¢Freedom Bowl: Southern Cal
vs. Utah

Back to back blowouts on the
same day. John Robinson should
get a bowl victory in his first year
back at USC. I’ll be kind. Will’s
Loser: Utah by 15.
eIndependence Bowl: Va. Tech
vs. Indiana

Ofall the bowls so far, this has
the potential for a good game to
watch. Though the two teams have
different styles, this game should
be tight. The game will be decided
in the final two minutes. Indiana’s
experience should prevail. Will’s
Loser: Va. Tech by 3.
ePeach Bowl: Kentucky vs.
Clemson

This game will be close mainly
because neither team can score.

Kentucky ended their season with
a 56-3 loss to Tennessee, and
Clemson pulled out a yawner ver-
sus a fultile South Carolina. Still,
Clemson has a new coach every-
one who cares seems to like and
that shouldbe the difference. Will’s
Loser: Kentucky by 6.
¢Gator Bowl: North Carolina vs.
Alabama

Doesn’t look like there is light
at the end of the tunnel for the Tide.
Too many ipjuries and too little
offense. UNC and Mack Brown
will be pleased with an 11-2 record
after enduring two 1-10 seasons a
mere five years ago. Will’s Loser:
Bama by 5.
eAlamo Bowl: California vs. lowa

Give Iowa some credit and

not so much to California. About
half way through the season, the
Golden Bears faded and will keep
slip sliding away, but the Hawkeyes
will keep it close. Will’s Loser:
Cal by 4.
*Hall of Fame Bowl: Michigan
vs. NCSU
Look out State, here comes a
bunch of angry Wolverines look-
ing for respect. They will get some
at the expense of the Wolfpack.
This one could get ugly. Will’s
Loser: N.C. State by 21.
*Cotton Bowl: Texas A&M vs.
Notre Dame
Sports Illustrated was right.
A&M will getto abowl and POOF-
-for the second year in a row, Notre
Dame will manhandle the Aggies.
Besides, it-is-hard to figure why
Notre Dame isn’t in the picture for
the National Championship any
more than they are. This bowl has
really lost its luster the last 5 years.
Will’s Loser: Texas A&M by 20.
Citrus Bowl: Tennessee vs. Penn
State
Tennessee is certainly one of
the five best teams in college foot-
ball rightnow, maybe higher. They
belong in a better bowl, but they’ Il
settle for a victory over Penn State.
This could be Heath Shuler’s last
game, probably not. Will’s Loser:
Penn St. by 13.
*Car-Quest Bowl: Boston Col-
lege vs. Virginia
BC beat Notre Dame and
should have beaten West Virginia.
This one won’t slip away, it’ll be
over by the third quarter. Will’s
Loser: UVa by 18.
Fiesta Bowl: Miami vs. Arizona
The Hurricane’s season could
have been different if they had not
gotten bitten by the “Fluke” bug in
‘West Virginia. Miami: will put

Upset of
the year

UNCC continued from page 14

Andre Davis scored 33 points a
year ago against Davidson, but this
year he shot 1-12 from the field for
3 points. Davis is the Forty-Niners
leading scorer this year with an
average of 17 points a game.
Former Freshman All-Ameri-
can Jarvis Lang looked like his
typical self with 20 points and 7
rebounds. Davidson did a good job
of keeping him off the offensive
glass where he is so dangerous.
Down the stretch, the Wildcats
were as cool as ice. They hit 24 of
28 from the line. They also out-
rebounded the bigger Forty-Niners
by a 37-29 margin. Davidson’s
bench deserves much of the credit
for the victory. They combined for
32 points and 15 rebounds.
Davidson also has some
Southern Conference leaders this
year. Narat (.679) and Spain (.667)
rank one and two respectively in
individual field goal percentages.
After this huge victory for the Cats,
they will face Oglethorpe at home
on Monday night and play the
Clemson Tigers at the Charlotte
Coliseum on Sunday. Hopefully,
the Cats can continue to play like a

team possessed. |

points on the board and Arizona’s
hurting offense will go nowhere.
Will’s Loser: Arizona by 10.
*Rose Bowl: Wisconsin vs. UCLA

Let the dream season come to
a rosy end for the badgers. Why
not? UCLA will keep it close with
the explosive receiver J.J. Stokes
in his last collegiate game.
Wisconsin’s fans deserve the win
and so does the school for the spirit
and guts that have been poured out
all season long, especially after
serving as the doormat of the Big
10 forso many years. Wills’s Loser:
UCLA by 6.
eSugar Bowl: West Virginia vs.
Florida

The hillbillies from
Morgantown won’t be able to
wrastle’ this gator. The 11-0 dream
season will come to a painful end,
the second time since 1988 Na-
tional Champion hopes will be
squashed. Go get ‘em Gatas! Will’s
Loser: WVU by 17.

*Orange Bowl: Florida State vs.
Nebraska

Well, all the other schools prior
to this game will tell the cameras
how they are #1 when they win.
All that can be thrown out the
window. The winner of this game
will be the 1993 National Colle-
giate Football Champions, Don’t
misunderstand the hype--there
won’tbe too much drama here, and
Bobby Bowden will finally get
what he’s wanted for so many
years: a ring. Will’s Loser: Ne-
braska by 24.

There they are, my bow! pre-
dictions. Understand, they are
strictly opinions. Have a fun holi-
day and good luck on exams. Re-
member, bowl season starts the
day after exams, so we’ll all be
home just in time, barely.

Lefty Dreisell inducted
into Davidson Hall of Fame
The former basketball coach
was honored for his 176 victories
and two trips to the NCAA final
eight in 1968 and 1969. He was
inducted during halftime of the
UNCC game and he stated to the
crowd, “This means a lot... . It
was an exciting time for me, be-
cause I was able to recruit good
players, good students who
worked hard and believed.”
Dreisell coached Davidson dur-
ing the college’s basketball glory
and they honored him Saturday

night.

Claudia Lombard
selected to Division I
All-South Region soccer team
Sophomore Lombard led the
team with 14 goals and 9 assists.
The Yassists set a Davidson school
record. She has 20 career goals
and has started every game at
Davidson. Lombard is the first
Davidson women’s soccer player
to be so recognized.

Men’s Wrestling competes,
loses to Gardner-Webb and
Newport News in home meet
Davidson wrestling lost 27-
15 to Gardner-Webb and to New-

port News, a team of shipmen.
Sam Knowles was a bright spot
for the Cats, going 2-0 in the 158
weight class. Jimmy Stewart and}
Robbie Fiero also have been inte-
gral to noticeable improvement
this season. Sean Harvey and
Francis Mitchell also wrestled well
on Saturday. Captain Fiero com-
mented, “With the Gardner-Webb}
loss, we showed a lot of promise.
We looked a lot better against
them than many of our matches in
the past. There is a new attitude sal
the team this year.”

Basketball commentators
return to DCTV

Davidson seniors Peter
Amidon, David Moore, and Rob-
ert Lloyd-Still returned to action
Saturday night for the men’s bas-
ketball game against UNCC. The
trio plans to broadcast all home|
games, which can be seen on
DCTV. Moore commented, “It’s
great to be in the limelight again.
We love connecting the students
with Davidson basketball. Most
importantly, it’s great to see the
basketball team playing so well. I
expect them to make the NCAA)
tournament for the first time since
1986.”
