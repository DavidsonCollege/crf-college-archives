After having their four game
winning streak snapped Jan. 17
by Anderson Junior Coflege, the
Davidson Wildcattes rebounded
for two home basketball vic-
tories.

A close win over N.C. State on
Jan. 20 preceded a Jan. 22 vic-
tory over Wake Forest’s
women’s team.

Anderson Junior College,
which has long emphasized
women’s sports, demolished the
Wildcattes 81-54.

Coaches Joe Duncan and
Charlie Slagle were quick to
commend the Davidson women
for their play on the Anderson
team’s home court. But, as one
of the Anderson players best
summed up the situation, ‘“‘We
are a buzzsaw of a good tedm.””

Anderson was the national
championship. women’s team
among junior colleges last year.
The Davidson women were
leading Anderson at an early
point in the game, when guard
Renee Soos was removed from
the action because of a mouth
injury and forward Nancy
Matheny was benched due to
foul trouble.

Davidson pulled ahead of
N.C. State late in that encounter
for a 64-59 win. The contest,
marked by numerous lead
changes, was conspicuously
physical. .

One N.C. State player
remarked that Davidson was
one of the roughest teams that
they have ever played.

A grinning Charlie Slagle
praised his team highly after

their 70-62 defeat of Wake
Forest: Wednesday night.

“We showed a lot of guts
coming back to win the way we
did. I think Nora McNeill’s ball-
handling was especially éf-
fective in bringing us out of our
first-half slump.”

Duncan echoed. Slagle’s
praise of McNeill and also poin-
ted out that Katherine Morton,
who had 15 rebounds, played an
integral role in denying Wake
Forest the victory.

Renee Soos led all scorers
with 20 points.

Davidson has been plagued

Eleveit'’

with inquiries and illness for the
last two games.

In addition to Renee Soos’
mouth injury, Nancy Matheny
dislocated a finger while
throwing the ball up in the air
and attempting a behind-the-
back catch before a practice
session.

Dea Booth is suffering from
tendonitis in her knee, while
several other players are
recuperating from the flu.

The next contest for the Wild-
cattes will be in Johnston Gym
Jan. 27, when they will oppose
Catawba College.
