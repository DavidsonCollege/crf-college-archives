2 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Partnership creates new
study abroad opportunity

+ Story continued from front page

Director Dr. William Harris.

The collaboration with the Biosphere 2 Cen-
ter will offer Davidson students an alternative to
the traditional study abroad options. Instead of
being immersed in a foreign culture, students will
be immersed in a foreign ecosystem studying
earth science systems.

The Biosphere 2 Center’s campus is nestled
in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains
just north of Tucson, Arizona. The centerpiece of
the campus is the Biosphere 2 apparatus, a 3.15-
acre enclosed glass and space frame structure
housing six of the earth’s ecosystems in minia-
ture, including a rainforest, a desert, a savannah
and a 900,000-gallon ocean. Biosphere 2 is an
enormously valuable tool for simulating the
earth’s systems and experimentally projecting
the planet's future under a variety of environ-
mental parameters. Davidson students will work
alongside the Biosphere 2 Center research staff
monitoring and adjusting the internal environ-
ment of the system to investigate questions vital
to our planet’s future.

Davidson students will live on the 250-acre
campus, take classes ranging from Conservation
Biology to Law, Politics, and Economics of Glo-
bal Change, and conduct a semester-long inde-
pendent research project. In addition to the
surrounding Sonoran desert, Davidson students
will embark on a number of field trips focusing on
the region’s geologic, biologic and cultural di-
versity. Past field trips have included the Grand
Canyon, Joshua Tree National Park and the Sea
of Cortez in Mexico,

Russell K. Monson, a professor of biology
at the University of Colorado, Boulder says of the

Earth Semester, “I think the Earth Semester Pro-
gram is the single most innovative educational
opportunity that has been provided to American
college students interested in environmental stud-
ies over the past decade. Our students who have
returned from attending Earth Semester have been
unanimous in proclaiming this as a life-changing
experience.”

The Earth Semester’s interdisciplinary ap-
proach includes a novel form of team-teaching in
which each faculty member, during the course of
the morning’s lecture, will lend their particular
expertise to the discussion of the environmental
issue at hand. For a module on global warming, the
first lecture of the day is delivered by an environ-
mental chemist, focusing on the atmospheric chem-
istry of Greenhouse Gases, transitioning to a sedi-
mentologist, onthe paleoclimatic evidence for past
fluctuations in the Earth's climate. Finally, the
morning would be brought to a close by an environ-
mental economist, with a discussion of the recent

- attempts by political leaders to pass international

legislation to mitigate the effects of global warm-
ing. All faculty members hold Columbia Univer-
sity appointments.

From biology to philosophy majors, all David-
son students are encouraged to take part in. the
Aside from the
Earth Semester, Davidson students will be able to
participate in the Biosphere 2 Center’s new Uni-
verse Semester, the Summer Biodiversity Institute;
Earth Systems Field School I: Encountering Eco-
systems, and Earth Systems Field School II: Earth
Systems Management.

Applications are being accepted through No-
vember 15 for the Spring 2000 Earth Semester.
Interested students should see Dr. Michael Dorcas,
Professor of Biology, for an application or apply
