‘I wouldn’t have traded it for the world”

Pre-Orientation sends freshmen into the wild

By LUCIA KENDALL

“T loved it! It was awesome!”
Karminder Gill aptly summed up
the feelings of other freshmen
about Pre-Orientation. Thirty-six
freshmen and thirteen trip leaders
(including both upperclassmen
and faculty) spent a week of back-
packing on the Appalachian Trail
and Whitewater Canoeing the
Chatooga and French Broad rivers
before freshman orientation
began.

“T really enjoyed getting to
meet people in a setting away
from campus,” said Chris Cooper.
“It was a relaxed way to get to
know them. Having all those
friends before school started made

the transition to college life a lot

easier.” Holme Oltrogge, a
sophomore, agreed. “You learn
about people from a different
angle when you’re in an environ-
ment other than the classroom.
It’s nice to just talk to people and
not have to think about school.”

For most of the activities the
large group of forty-nine was di-
vided into four smaller groups
who got different colored t-shirts.
Although there was a wide variety
of personalities in each of the.
groups, as Chonita Riddick put it,
“the groups were just meant to be
together. Especially the yellow
and fuchsia groups, they were just
incredibly put together.” The
cohesiveness of the groups is il-
lustrated by the fact that the re-
lationships that were established
are still growing closer. Tina
Laidlaw and Kelly Crews have de-
veloped an especially close bond,
and ‘Charles White and Frances
Redmond, who first met and got
to know each other during “Pre-
O,” are now dating. But as Holme
said, “people didn’t spend all their
time with one or two others, we all
mixed together and everyone got

Pop film

Call the

Ghostbusters ranks among. the
most popular movies of all time. It
was the biggest-grossing movie of
the 1984 summer season. The
song “Ghostbusters” became a top
ten hit on the pop charts.
Ghostbusters T-shirts were every-
where and the:'Republicans, in an.
attempt to cash in on the populat-
ity of the movie, put out a

along with the whole bunch.”

Roughing it was a bit more
than some. freshmen expected.
Karminder said “I thought there
were going to be comfortable log
cabins, and showers, and steak for
dinner. I brought oxford shirts and
nice sweaters. [ruined my white
tennis outfit; my mom washed it
three times and it’s still dirty. The
trip was worth it, though.” Sev-
eral people challenged themselves
and found out how much they
could do. Charles used Frances as
an example: “Would you expect to
see this girl out in the woods with
a forty-pound pack on her back?
She looks like she belongs maybe
in a mall or something.” But Fr-
ances loved it. “I’d tell freshmen
next year that they should defi-
nitely go on it,” she said.

Everyone had a different ex-
periences to tell about, from com-
bat boots three sizes too big to the
songs Ed Daugherty and Stan
Hynds (college staff) sang that ev-
eryone else was too young to have

ever heard. Holme mentioned Phil -

Prescott’s sports trivia. Lindsey
Forsythe talked about the girls
shaving their legs in the Chatooga
and the flips off the rope swing.
“The red group spent hours just
playing games they thought they
had forgotten,” said Leigh Hall, a
sophomore. “It was like free time
on ‘the playground where you
come up with your own entertain-
ment instead of just watching TV
showed that even the seemingly
sedate members of our group have
a wild side to them that surprised
us (and them) as they dove
ruthlessly for silverware. Tania
Tambiah was violent enough to-
break a spoon. Finding out that
males supposedly think about sex
every seven seconds provided the
yellow and fuchsia groups with

running jokes throughout the trip.
Chonita thought that the funniest
thing on the trip was “in a word,
canoeing with Lucia.” In Charles’
group, the yellows, it was
“Watching Ward [Bradley] catch
the porch on fire. Everybody was
stomping on the porch to put it
out...it wasn’t really Ward’s
‘fault, though.” Lindsey talked
about Tina’s game suggestions. “I

couldn’t believe she really wanted _

the whole-white group to play
hokey-pokey and leap-frog. Of
course, we never actually did.”
Tania remembered jokes about the
honeypot, which was a pickle
canister we had to use as a toilet.
Almost everyone enjoyed dump-
ing the other canoeists into the
river. Lindsey recalled an interest-
ing drink for her group: “We
boiled water and added the hot
chocolate mix. When we stirred it
the powder stuck to the spoon, and
it kept getting harder and harder.
We found out later that it was pud-
ding mix.” Chonita was enter-
tained by the red group chanting
like druids as they built a fire.
Karminder mentioned mystery
scenarios that Missy White, a
senior, gave their group to solve
on the trail: “it kept our minds off
our feet.” Anya Mcdonald en-
joyed throwing the “frisbees
around in the evenings and the
talks around the fire. The rapids

challenged Holme: “You analyze

them and plan your route and what

strokes you’re going to use, and

then you shoot through it. Making

-it through at the end was really

great.”

A lot of learning took place,
too. Dr. Grant, a biology profes-
‘sor, pointed out a camouflaged
moth and told his group a little bit
about the spiders they found in
holes of a rock. Karminder learn-
ed to play hacky sack, how to put

up tarps and how to tie three new
knots. Frances tried whitewater
canoeing for the first time.
Lindsey had the new experience
of cleaning greasy pans with sand.

“Tt was a real growing experi-
ence,” said Chonita. “You learn
about yourself out there in the
woods. You get a chance to be
closer to God: there are none of
the ordinary distractions. I ap-

preciated life more, you know,
nature and all, being close to it.
You also appreciate material
things like showers. And you can
look at what people are really like;
nobody cared about the external
stuff like how you looked or what
you wore. You just really got to
know people. The trip was hard
sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade
that experience for the world.”

Ghostbusters ? Why Bother?

Which places this reviewer in
a very small minority

I saw Ghostbusters the sum-
mer it was released. Everyone told
me about how hilarious the movie
was and to look out for the perfor-
mance of Bill Murray. Murray,
they told me, was the best part of a
very funny movie. Following
their advice, I plunked down my
four dollars for a ticket, sat down

in the dark, and waited to ache

with laughter. I waited, waited,
and waited. I was still wondering
what all the fuss was about when

the movie ended.

Two of my friends thought the
movie was hilarious. Whenever I
mentioned that Ghostbusters was
going to be shown at*Davidson,
people immediately said that they
would have to see it. By all the
standards of democracy and con-
sensus, Ghostbusters is one of the
best comedies of all time.

To. me Ghostbusters simply
rambled from skit to skit, grab-
bing comedy ideas like a desper-
ate improvisational act, and then
wasting what good ideas it had.
My opinion did not change after I
had reviewed the film once again
for this article. A second viewing
only. showed -even more wasted

opportunities for a really good
comedy.

Murray is at the heart of the
movie’s problem. Almost all of
the film is subordinated to letting
Murray get all the best lines, the
best skits, and the best girls. What
happens is that Ghostbusters be-

comes a:one-man show, with all _

the rest of the cast doing nothing
more than playing straight men
and women to Bill the Clown.
Putting Murray in the center of
the movie wouldn’t be such a bad
idea if he were very funny. The
problem is that he isn’t. Murray
always plays one type of charac-
ter — the obnoxious brat who
thumbs his nose at authority. This
style worked very well in Stripes,
when he was ragging the Army,
and in Meatballs, when he was
twisting all the boring rules of

‘summer camps. In Ghostbusters
Murray. has .got. the. show. com- .

‘for the

pletely to himself. There is no au-
thority to battle, except perhaps
idiot EPA inspector
(perhaps that’s why the Republi-
cans used this movie). This bas-
tion of authority enters the action
about halfway through the picture
but is soon put back into place by
Bill_the Magnificent. So
you’ve got, then, is a movie-in
which Bill is the life of the party.
‘Fhe plot shambles along,
picking up ideas like burrs. When
things get dull, the makers of
Ghostbusters throw in something
else and hope. Their desperate ef-
forts to find something funny
leave the movie tasting like a stew

‘made of leftovers. The plot alter-

nates between Murray chasing the
girl, the Busters going after a
ghost, Murray trapping Weaver

into adate, and the Busters getting '

another ghost, and then winds up

with a.general apocalypse. This is .

supposed to be humorous. The re-
sult is often this sort of scene (but
be carefal not to laugh too hard):

Ramis: Don’t cross the currents.
Murray: What happens if we cross
the currents? A oi
Ramis: I’m not sure, but life as we
know it throughout the universe

Murray: O.K. Be careful.

Chen: Yeah, wow, zowie,
yeehaw, yip, yip, yip.
They repeat this joke a couple

of times so the audience can get it.
These comments will proba-
bly not change anybody’s mind.
The people who liked Ghostbus-
ters the first time will want to see it
again. The people who have never
seen it can ignore this carping and
go along with the majority.
Ghostbusters will be shown in the -
900 Room on Wednesday at 9:45.
p.m, and on Friday at -pem<
