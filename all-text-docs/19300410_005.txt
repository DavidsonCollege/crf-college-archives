Instrument

Ernest Skinner, who is considered the most
outstanding organ builder in) America to-
day, was at Davidson College two days last
week inspecting the $20,000 organ which
bears his name, in the auditorium. of Cham-
bers Building. He was accompanied by two
assistants, and the three of them spent sev-

They were en route to their Massachusetts
headquarters Alabama, where Mr.
Skinner had been inspecting a $50,000 organ
recently installed at an institution in’ that
State. He said that he was in Europe last
summer when the Davidson organ was com-
pleted and shipped to the college, and that
he had made it a point to stop by Davidson
to give the organ any personal attention
which it needed. During his stay he re-
marked that in bygone days he always per-
sonally inspected his organs, but that today

it was impossible to visit all the places
where they had been installed. He also con-
gratulated Davidson upon having an audi-
torium that was practically acoustic-perfect.

This master builder of organs and musi-
cian of world note was able to get strains
from the organ that have not yet been’ ob-
tained by anyone playing it. Only a few
people were aware that Davidson had such
a distinguished visitor, for many of the
faculty and practically all of the students
were out of town for the holidays. Conse-
quently, only this few had the opportunity
of hearing him play.
