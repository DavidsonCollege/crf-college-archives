New energy group clarifies activities

To the Editor:

We appreciate the strong support
and interest the student body has given
us in our study of the energy future of
this country. In case our ideas were
misconstued, we would like to offer
further clarification concerning our
group’s activities.

Over a month ago, the group began

investigating the problems and bene-
fits of nuclear power and alternative
energy sources. The issue is complex,
and our commitment to the understan-

Common man thinks he

Editor’s note: This is the second half of
a column begun last week concerning

government reform and private proper-
ty. mene
By common consent we are said to

live in a democracy, which is distin-.

guished from all other methods of
governing by the fact that the gover-
nors and. the governed are identical. It
follows, then, as Victor Gollancz
observed, that ‘‘anything done in a
democracy is done in your name.”

It seems reasonably obvious that if
private prope.'ty were abolished a large
supply of/very able tal could be
shifted from creating i reecting
private property to makMg arrange-
ments for doing those things we ought
to have done and leaving undone those
things we ought not to have done.

The question persists, why is this
not done in this democratic society?
The answer is given in a delightful book
by David Hapgood, The Screwing of
the Average Man. What is news is that
the average person, in the United
states, at least, has been subtly, but
effectively and completely, conned into
liking it.

This new situation has been esta-
blished by several subdolous measures,

ding of the issue required extensive
research. The primary concern of the
group since inception has been to avoid
the bog of emotionalism and extreme
positions.

We understand that biased and
irrational attitudes only cloud the issue
and detract from credibility. In spite of
the hard work required for objective
research, we felt compelled to devote
our time and effort because of the
implications of nuclear power.

‘The group is united in its opposition

devices, etc. that have been developed
for the purpose of cozening and
hoodwinking the average person.

One of these measures is ‘‘youtoo-
ism,’’ which is defined as “the belief
that whatever applies to the rich
applies to the average man too, the
strategy for seducing. people into
accepti ig their own screwing. It con-

_ sists of giving, the average man just

enough of a break to convince him he’s
benefitting from the system.”’

No wonder we applaud when some-
one blames our difficulties and ills on
government. The flim flam man gets
away with his chicanery-because no one
wants to confess to being swindled.

(The gammoning has been going on
for sometime in the United States, but
until the post-World War II era,
complete success was confined to the
area of ‘‘defense.’’ Veblen noted in the
1920’s that:

. back of it all is the nation’s
divine right to carry arms, to support a
competitive military establishment,
whick has ceased under the new order
to have any other material use than to
enforce or defend the businesslike right
of particular vested interests to get
something for nothing in some particu-
lar place and in some particular way,

collected in the fall, exceed our goal for

Gladden wins
UMOC laurels

To the Editor:

We offer our congratulations to Phil
Gladden, winner of the Ugly Man on
Campus Contest for the second year in
a row. The top vote getters in the
contest were Phil Gladden— $44.30,
John Brice—$42.03, Joel Shirk —
$30.66, Dr. Stell—$12.92, and John
Ratliff—$12.60. The total amount
raised for the Cystic Fibrosis Founda-
tion was $167.75.

Thanks to everyone who contributed
and a special thank you to Ron Scott
for generously donating a keg as the
winner’s prize.

not end, however, unit] 30 September,
1978, and I would urge all able
members of the community to give
again in Charlotte before this expira-
tion date.

I wish to expressly thank the APO
service fraternity and all the volunteers
who worked for their support and to
thank the Davidson College Student
Union for its patience. But our special
thanks goes to those who gave their
blood.

Don’t forget that the bloodmobile
returns to Davidson next fall. Let’s
keep up the good work. Thank you all
again.

to nuclear power, particularly reproces-

development of solar energy and other
alternatives by such preponderant
emphasis on nuclear power.

Many members of the group felt the
Barnwell rally and protest would be
effective expressions of their commit-
ment to energies not plagued by waste
problems and high cost. They believed
that legal and political avenues of
expression had failed and that a strong
demonstration of commitment was

Many persons, including Hapgood,
in another book, The Average Man
Fights Back, place great hopes in the
current increase in the number of
citizens’ groups, epitomized by “‘Com-
mon Cause,” to bring reforms that will
correct the situation. Undoubtedly
some changes will be made, but before
one becomes completely ecstatic about
the possiblities of any real change, it
would be well to consider the following
quotation from Veblen’s Theory of
Business Enterprise:

ie . It is not a question of what

ought to be done, but’ of what is the
course laid out by business principles;

the discretion rests with the business -

men, not with the moralists, and the
business men’s discretion is bounded
by the exigencies of business enter-
prise. Even the business men cannot
allow themselves to play fast and loose
with business principles in response to
a call from humanitarian motives. The
question, therefore, remains, on the

whole; a question of what the business
men may be expected to do for cultural
growth on the motive of profits.”’

necessary. Others were not sure about
the efficacy of civil disobedience. They
reasoned that arrest might be counter-
productive to the attempt to elicit
broad support of the anti-nuclear
cause.
The decision of each member of the
group was personal and yet the group
entered the protest with mutual under-
standing about the decisions of fellow
members. Everyone in the group
opposes nuclear power; our methods of
acting on this commitment differ
according to our ideas about how we
can best achieve the development of
safe, renewable resources of energy.

We feel the protest achieved impor-
tant national and local coverage,
although in the minds of some evening
news viewers the whole thing was
written off as a party or a nostalgic trip
back into a departed decade; it was
neither. In general, the rally and
protest were serious attempts to share
our concerns about nuclear energy with
others.

Neither was an end in itself. We hope
the impact of our activities will
encourage others to look beyond the
publicity campaigns sponsored by
those with vested interests in nuclear
power. Too often these vested interests
preclude an objective look at the social
costs of.a nuclear future. An optimal
decision can occur only if people who
will benefit and suffer with nuclear
power have input into our nation’s
decision-making.

Our group will not stop working; we
plan to continue our research and urge
anyone interested to join us. We have
reading materials both pro and con,
and we appreciate the chance to share
our thoughts with others.
