IMAC Report

“Mothership tdps A- leagué |

By BAD BERNARD
and
HOGMAN

There has been word around
campus that a ‘“‘Total Wo-
man’’ encounter group has
been formed by some of the
more radical coeds. We are not
going to mention any names,
but if you guessed Ellen
Ogilvie, Cathy Landis, or
Angela Barnett we would say
you were close.

This news upset Kad Bernie
and Hogman because rumor
has it that we could lose
money for IMAC sports if
there was not a ‘“‘Total Man’”’
group formed to comply with
Title XIXXII Funds.

So, we have decided to
begin our own “Total Man”
encounter group and as Chair
“‘person’’ we have named the
honorable Mike Sheridan. The
first meeting is Monday at
10:00 in the Union and the
topic will be ‘How to Keep
Your Masculinity on the Da-
vidson Campus.”

Other guest lecturers have
already been booked, and big
names like the one called
Reigel and his scholarly col-
league, the Boy Abdul are sure
to appear. For more infor-
mation on future meetings
check the john in the basement
of the library.

There were several big
games this past week and two
of them witnessed clashes
between our top ten teams.
Tuesday night saw the mater-
ialization of the inevitable
meeting of the Mothership
Connection and the young
boys that wear black T-shirts
and call themselves ‘‘Hurtin’
for Certin’ ”’

And in the end it was the
experience that counted as the
upperclassmen rolled to a
50-45 victory. It would be ad-
visable for the freshmen to
bring more than five players to
the games from now on. “‘I like
long distance runners’’ Lapple
had 13 (22.7) below his aver-

age) and Mike Peskosky
chipped in 14. Pow-
ell Slaughter was the dif-
ference on- the boards as he
hauled in 12 rebs and had 8
points. ie

For ‘‘Hurtin’ for Gertin’ ”
‘“‘Doc’’ Gifford ‘‘Maravich”’
Piercy was held to only 13,
while John Porter had a
game-high 16. Minor Sinclair
also had 13 points for the
losers while Joe-B Merten
didn’t do jack.

In the other big game of the
week Tex’s KA’s lost a thriller
to the men of Hand Sown
Home Grown (boy, I hate that
name), 60-55. The KA’s were
down for the game as their
noble leader, the Hogman, had
stomach pains and did not suit
up for the contest. Bruce
Fielden was the key for HSHG
as he led the way with 14
points. Big Tex had a game-
high for the losers.

The gentlemen and scholars
that live in the far rear house
on Patterson Court (better
known as the SAB’s) con-
tinued to roll and remain

undefeated as they deflated
the 5 PHI’s, 51-22. Stan

Brown had 14 points for the
winners and Tim Purcell 5
fouls for the losers. Tim Barr
also had a field goal in that

contest.
In the B League it looks as

if all the teams that get a
chance to play in:the final
tourney still have a chance to
win the big trophy. Bone has
emerged due to the intense
play of Perz as a contender.
We know that is a dangling
participle and we don’t care
because no professor can grade
us on this.

Other title contenders are
the Squatty Bodies, the Fam-
ily, Reign of Terror, the
Ragmen, the Red Hounds,
and B S Express. Not neces-
sarily in that order, and if that
order bothers you, feel free
during your spare time to take
a pencil and paper and rear-

range them in any order that

Moccasins trip Wildcats

By BRIAN KELLEHER
DAVID NEISLER
And HAYNE NEISLER
Staff Writers
The Davidson Wildcats, de-
spite a 32 point effort by John
Gerdy, could not overcome
their recent slump and lost to
U.T. Chattanooga 96-86 in
Charlotte Wednesday night.
5’11”’ guard Edsel Brooks’ 36
points paced the UTC attack.
Moccasin Coach Ron Shu-
_mate said, ‘‘We worked real
hard for this game. We re-
bounded real well and our zone
was excellent. If they would
have been able to take the
lead, it might have killed us.”
A positive side of the game
for the Cats was the inside
play of freshman Rich DiBe-
nedetto and Brad Walder.
DiBenedetto played an ag-
gressive inside game, scoring
20 points and collecting 11
rebounds.
Brad Walker played nine
minutes and scored 12 points.

“Brad,’’ Davidson Coach John
Kochan remarked, ‘‘played
with enthusiasm and _ hustle.
Walker will definitely get a
chance to play against the big
boys of Notre Dame.”’

The game was close
throughout the early part of
the first half as Davidson
actually had an 18-17 lead at
the 12:24 mark. After a Chat-
tanooga time-out, the Mocca-
sins responded with seven
straight unanswered points
and took a lead from which the
Cats could never recover. UT
led by seven at halftime,
43-36.

The Wildcats began the
final half with a quick burst of
scoring and, with 18:19 to go,
trailed by one. Davidson,
however, could get no closer,
as the Moccasins pulled away
to a 15 point lead. The Cats
were plagued by erratic de-
fense which resulted in easy
transition baskets. UT —C col-

With 4% minutes to go,
Davidson began a last-ditch
rally in which they pulled to
within seven points. UT—C
held firm, however, and went
on to collect the victory.

Kochan commented after
the game, ‘John Gerdy shot
well for us. He was 13 for 28
from the field and played his
usual fine game. Edsel Brooks
is shooting 43 percent on the
year, and the two times a-
gainst us he shot like Jerry
West.”’

The defeat extended the
Cats losing streak to five
games. Saturday, against
Dartmouth, they played unin-
spired ball in an 82-69 loss.
Gerdy led the Cats with 26
points and Dodds added 22.

Monday night’s game a-
gainst powerful St. Johns was
a different story, however.
Except for the first three mi-
nutes of the second half, the
Cats gave the Redmen a very
even game. Gerdy again led
Davidson with 28 points in the
79-67 loss.

Freshman Todd Haynes
was still able to find some
optimism for the future after
the loss: ‘‘I feel the team is
starting to pull together and
we could pull off an upset on
the road soon.”’
