“The first record we have of the ob-

come to be perhaps the most widely
celebrated holiday in the Western world

Very littie is certain about the date of
the first Christmas, pointed out Vowles.
At first it was celebrated in the spring
but in 350 A.D. the present time of the
year was adopted. The Jeaders of the
Church wished to supplant the pagan
festivals by Christian observances and
the present time of Christmas coincides
with the lengthy pagan celebration of
the winter solstice

Other pagan contributions to our
Christmas clebration are the holly, mis-
tletoe and the Christmas tree. Even
after heathen festivals had been dis-
placed, remarked Vowles, abuses and ex-
cesses still clung to the Christmas cele-
bration so that in 1644 English Puritans
forbade any merrimént whatever.

Vowles then told of the development
of Christmas carols, and the rest of the
program consisted of a dozen selected
Carols played on the organ by J. C.
Pfohl, with introductory sketches by
Vowles. Another musical highlight of
the same program was Pfohl’s cornet

solo, “Nazareth,” by Gounod.
On the next program. Dr. W. L.
Lingle chose as his topic, “Woodrow

interesting sidelights on his life

the negative and pointed out that his rec-
ord for deportment was 100. His grades
were excellent with the exception of
mathematics.

French Department.

The Association met in Philadelphia,

Swarthmore College. According to Dr.

attended this year.

The general opinion of the delegates
was that the teaching profession seems
to have rdunded the corner and is steadily
improving. They believe, also, that
there is at present more chance for
[young men interested in teaching than
at any time in the past, and as condi-
tions for the teachers improve, more op-
portunity for entering the profession will
be afforded.

Large student audiences attended the

Two films, one of the National Inter-
collegiate Track Meet of 1932, held at
the University of Southern California,
and the National Intercollegiate Track
Meet of 1930, held at the University of
Chicago, were enjoyed on Monday night's
program.

On Tuesday afternoon, students were
also treated to that ancient privilege of
seeing a Wildcat team down Wake For-
est. The picture was that of the Thanks-
giving game of 1934 when the 'Cats, led
by Johnny Mackorell, downed the Dea-
con 13-12.

The famous quarter mile race beween
Eastman and Carr was the feature show-
ing of Monday evening. Carr is the
holder of 46.9 seconds, World record for
the quarter mile and Eastman holds the
record for the half mile run, 149.9 sec-
onds. Carr took the superb quarter mile
race, seen in slow motion by the audience.

In an effort to bring a truly outstand-
ing orchestra to Davidson the Pan-Hel-
lenic Council has contracted with Kay
Kyser and his nationally known band to
play for the Mid-winter dance’ set, the
gala event of the Davidson social calen-
dar.

Kay Kyser has a band already well
known to Davidson students. At present
he is located at the famous Blackhawk

individual bull sssions, B Kenney
gave a few selections on the accordion
which were enjoyed by all. Punch,
cakes, cigars and cigarettes were served
during the evening and were served by
‘several volunteering freshmen.

There were approximately sixty at-
tendants at the function. After the meet-

in Chicago, but next month
he is going to make a southern tour for
the ;urpose of playing at several college
dances, He has engagements to play at
eight southern schools, including the Uni-
versity of Tennessee, Sewanee, Alabama,
Auburn, Georgia Tech, North Carolina,
Washington and Lee, and Davidson. At
present he broad nightly over WGN

ing was over the boys gathered
outside of Chambers and gave a yell for
the class of "38.

These smokers are annual events of
each freshman class and are to bring
each boy in closer contact with his fel-
low classmen. It brings a unity to the
class as a whole and makes each boy
seem more friendly to the other, The
smoker was such a big success that an-
other is being planned as soon as pos-
sible,

and associated broacasting stations.
The date for the set of dances has
been set for Friday and Saturday, Feb-
ruary 15 and 16, The usual procedure
will be followed, with a formal dance
on Friday night, a tea dance on Saturday
afternoon, and an informal dance on
Saturday night. All three dances will
take place in the Charlotte Armory.
Plans are being made for some type of

figure for one of the dances. A price

for the dances has not been set.

Since Kay Kyser himself is a North
Carolinian from Rocky Mount, and since
eight members of his orchestra are also
from this state, the band is in great de-
mand among the colleges of the state,
It is possible that a conflict in dates will
arise between Davidson and two other
schools. In case of such a conflict,
Davidson would have the prior claim,
having signed their contract before sities
of the others.

In the event that Kay Kyser fails to
fulfill his part of the contract, the Pan-
Hellenic Council assures the student
body that another orchestra of. equal rank
and fame will be secured. The Council
issued this statement in order to clear
up rumors and‘to forewarn the students
concerning the orchestra set-up for mid-
winters. |.

“We want the student body to realize
that the council is not trying to make any
money out of these dances,” said Mims
Rogers, president of the Pan-Hellenic
Council. “We believe that the students
are willing to support big time dancing,
and we are making an effort to bring it
to them. This is their chance to show
whether they want it or not.”

Pfohl gave a cornet solo, Londonberry

Pfohl.

Mr. McClure took his text from
Ezekiel 22:30, “I sought for a man. .
but I found none.” The children of
Israel—all of them—prophets, Priests,
princes—had become corrupt. God was
seeking for a man to lead them from
their sins, But he found none,

Today, God is searching through the
world—through Davidson campus—for
a man of high moral ideals, with a true
conception of God, and with a feeling of
the brotherhood of man whom He cari
use in the work of advancing His king-
dom. Will He find one?

Mr. McClure is an alumnus of David-
son College, class of ‘31, and of Union
Theological Seminary, class of '34. He
came to Davidson this fall to serve as
secretary of the college YMCA.

Unknown Second Lieutenant
Steals Pistol And Fails To
Attend Drill

THREE CHARGES BROUGHT

Trial Will Be Held On January
Ninth At 7:30 P.M.

Rumors of a Military Court-Martial
on the campus were fully confirmed late
today by a report from Headquarters of
the Davidson Battalion, Reserve Offi-
cers Training Corps.

With the reports came a copy of the
charges and an extract of a special or-
der from Atlanta authorizing the trial.
The name of the accused, a second lieu~
tenant of D company, has not yet been
made public.

Although a court-martial has been in
the offing since early December when a
pistol was stolen from the armory, offi-
cialg have kept their actions shrouded in
secrecy, and it was not until this after-
noon that the details were made public.

Members of the prosecution, having
done a good job of sleuthing, have
brought three charges against the ac-
cused lieutenant. They are as follows:

Charge I: Violation of the Ninety-
Third Article of War. That said lieu-
tenant “did, at Davidson, N. C., on’ or
about D ber 5, 1934, feloniously take,
steal, and carry away one pistol, caliber
.45, automatic, serial no. 19382, value
about twenty-five dollars,: ($25.00), the
property of the United States.”

Charge II: Violation of the Sixty-
Fourth Article of War, That said lieu-
tenant “ .. . haviag received a lawful
order from Captain J. M. Douglas, his
superior officer . . . to be present for
parade with his company on December
5, 1934, did, . . . willfully disobey the
same.”

Charge III: Violation of the Ninety-
Fifth Article of War. That said lieu-
tenant “. . . did at Davidson, N.C... .
with intent to deceive . . . his company

fficially state to said com-

ti the. eabbictok-tsbasy pledged by ihe
students.

Each year the Y. M. C. A. of David-
son College ‘inaugurates a drive to help
some needy cause. This years contribu-
tions will aid in completing: two unfin-
ished churches, being constructed under
the direction of “Ham” (Rev. R.: H.)
Stone

“Ham” Stone, an alumnus of David-
son, visited the college before Christmas
and explained the purpose for which the
money will be used. For ten years Rev.
Stone ‘has* devoted’ his life to the work
in Ashe County in an unparalleled fash-
ion. Rev, Stone, in his chapel talk on
Tuesday, described the work which is
being done in his mountain pastorate and
the very real need felf by his two
churches there.

He described the great pene! sacri-
fices made by bers of his congreg

mander that he, . . . was sick and on
his way to the infirmary, which state-
ment was known by said liewtenant to be
untrue.”

The above charges, stated as “very
serious” by authorities, were accompanied
by an order from Htlanta which read
as follows: (Extract) “A general
Court-Martial is hereby appointed to
meet at Davidson College, Davidson, N.
C., Jan. 2, 1935, or as soon thereafter
as practicable, for the trial of such cases
as may be brought before it.
