THE NEW LOOK

A plush, wine-colored, wall-to-wall carpet in
head coach Homer Smith’s office, a wooden observa-
tion tower resembling some sort of medieval seige
equipment, and the promise of new uniforms symbo-
lize Davidson’s “New Look” in football.

These changes are minor compared to some
that Coach Smith and his young staff have brought
to Davidson already.

On Open End last Wednesday night, before a
full house in the union, Coach Smith answered ques-
tions about his team, his recruiting, his plans and
his hopes.

Citing defensive left cornerback Tommy Dews
and running back Steve Smith for their outstanding
performances so far in practice, Coach Smith refused
to really point at any weaknesses as disastrous.

_ Admitting quarterback was a source of inexper-
ience and would be subject to trial, Smith apparently
was not upset over this:

- “Of course I'd like to have Joe Namath as my
quarterback, but then I guess you'd like to have Bear
Bryant.”

When asked about the need of working on fund-
amentals, Smith expounded some of his good sense
approach to a situation:

“First of all we want to make use of the natural
abilities of our players so we can judge them fairly
as athletes. Why correct a boy too early on funda-
mentals and have him so worried about which foot
goes where when he starts to stop a man, that his
play suffers?

“These boys have to adapt to a different style
of play, I don’t want to criticize fundamentals be-
cause that would be criticizing my predecessor and I
don’t ever intend to do this.”

Coach Smith has a big job. As he says his big-
gest problem is in establishing a way of play. Not
only must he teach his new team this new way of
play but he must evaluate and install at the same
ime.

Still his probelms seem to be smaller and
smaller when we look at the job he has already done
with football at Davidson.

Embarking on a course without a model school
to follow he is depending on his staff and himself
for ideas about Davidson football.

He wants a team “fun to watch.” With enthus-
jastic players and an excited, though maybe just
curious student body as his following, Coach Smith
seems well on his way to reaching his goal.

“We've got to win, we've just got to” Coach
Smith softly confessed late Wednesday. But win or
not much has already been done. Finally at Davidson
the worst thing obout Homecoming won’t be the
football game.

JOHN LITTLE SETS FOR W. VA. PITCH
‘Cats Drop Two More In Baseball

Netters Sweep Three,
Extend Mark To 13-1

By MIKE MOOTY
Davidsonian Sports Writer

_Davidson’s tennis team upped its record to 13-1 this week, taking matches from
Pfeiffer, Old Dominion, and St. Andrews.

Pfeiffer fell early in the week
9-0 despite what Coach Harry
Fogleman called a ‘‘bad day.”

The Wildcats took Old Do-
minion 8-1 Tuesday afternoon,
dropping one doubles match.
Fogleman indicated that he
was not at all satisfied with the
doubles play of the team so
far this season. He has shifted
his lineup pairing Bill Council
with Dick Hurd and Bill Schutt
with Emonds Phelps.

Fogleman emphasized that
this is “strictly an experiment,"
but added that “we are going
to have to do something to im-
prove our doubles play.’

The ‘Cats swept past St.
Andrews Thursday 9-0. This
victory was the eighth straight
win for the squad since an
early season loss to Rollins.

After a home match with Tol-
edo next Tuesday, the Fogle-
men will go south to face foes
in Atlanta, Ga. and Spartan-
burg, taking on Emory, Thurs-

Wofford game was _ originally

but was moved into the slot
left vacant by the cancellation
of the match with Oglethorpe.

schedule, Coach Fogleman
pointed out that Toledo has an

“exceptionally fine squad” this
year. He added that they were i"

bleheader to West Virginia by
3-0 and 6-2.

“We had good pitching, and
everybody was hustling,’’ com-
mented Coach Stevens, ‘‘but we
weren't hitting the ball at
the right time."

Davidson had ffive hits com-
pared to four for West Vir-
ginia in the first game, but
the Wildcats couldn't turn them
into runs.

Bryan pitched the four-hitter
for Davidson and was credited
with the loss while John Rabo-
sevich went all seven innings
for the Mountaineers.

In the second game West
Virginia exploded for four runs
in the fifth while Davidson could
produce only two, and the Moun-
ties took the game 6-2.

Dave Johnson pitched the en-
tire game for the ‘Cats and
added a double to the losing ef-
fort while Hyder and Dick Sny-

der had two hits apiece.

The only exciting moment in
the otherwise dull game came
with two out in the last inning,
and the bases loaded. A grand-
slam would put the game into
extra innings, and who should
walk up to the plate but David-
son's own Casey, centerfielder
Snyder.

Snyder took the first strike
in the genuine Casey manner,
fouled off the second pitch, and
took a tremendous swing at the
next pitch as the dall sounded
in the catcher’s mitt for the
third strike.

Davidson meets a good team
from East Carolina today
and Saturday and face High
Point Thursday. East Carolina
clobbered Davidson in their last
meeting. Coach Stevens says
that High Point is supposed to
be good, but he emphasized
hopefully that, “We're going to
win some ballgames.”

Linksters Club VPI
To Set 4-0 SC Mark

The Wildcat golf team outshot VPI by a 10%-
7% score and picked up their fourth consecutive
Southern Conference victory against no defeats in

Charlotte Monday.

The win, coming on the team’s home course at

bal

Carolina Golf Club, advanced the ‘Cats’ overall re-
cord to eight wins and four defeats. Mackey Mc-
Clelland shared medalist honors with Bill Cochrane
of the Gobblers as he carded a 74.

The victory presaged a successful performance
by the Cats in the Conference Tournament, for VPI
is considered their toughest competition for the
championship.

‘We have now defeated the top three finishers
—VPI, The Citadel, and George Washington—in
last year’s tournament,” commented Coach Tom
Scott. He further pointed out that although regular
season competition is scored by match play and the
tournament will be medal play the ’Cats defeated
VPI by both scoring systems.

Yesterday, the team visited Durham to play the
Blue Devils of Duke, but because of the inability of

MANDATE FOR CHANGE 3

Last Monday the gavel of the IMAC presidency
was handed to Tommy Hunter. Along with his of-
fice Hunter has inherited the usual mumble-jumbie
of ineptness that runs Davidson’s intramural
program.

Mike Thurman tried last year. For one person,
with no unified assistance at all, he did remarkably
well.

The main problem that Thurman faced was the
same one that Hunter will soon encounter — com-
plete apathy. Really, who gives a happy damn what
the IMAC does?

Thurman tried, but could never have solved the
mammoth problems of apathy by himself, and after
Christmas break a quorum at an IMAC meeting was
as rare as a perfumed sweatsock.

Changes must break this death grip of apathy.
The followng proposals should be enacted immedi-
ately by the council:

1. Running standings should be
kept in each sport as it
progresses.

2. Statistics on each sport should
be kept by the same people
who are keeping the standings.
Committees of from one to
three IMAC members could
keep records on each sport.
Up-to-date, overall standings
must be kept by the president
and vice-president.

4. The five point penalty for the
failure of a fraternity’s rep-
resentative to show at a meet-
ing should be enforced. A ten
point penalty be considered
The point penalty for no refer-
ees should be enforced. The
constitution says a team will be
penalized three points if one
referee fails to show and five if
both are missing: The penalties
should be raised to five for one
and eight for two referees not
appearing for their game.
Re-examine the value system
with a mind to eliminate hand-
ball or change it to a double
elimination tournament like
tennis was last year. .
Along the same lines the point
values of flickerball, basket-
ball, and softball should be
raised, or the point values of
minor (intermediate) individual
sports, swimming, wrestling,
and track should be lowered. — ;

But if the trouble the IMAC had in electing their
officers (three meetings, no quorum at the first
two) is an indication of a new look, things have-

t changed at all.
n “Hunter faces a monumental job next year.

Barring a miracle, the entire IMAC set-up will have
to be eitered to suit the changes suggested in the

nt faculty fraternity report.
mere These changes I have offered must come now,

there is time, before all IMAC energy is
aipended trying to adjust to the labor pains caused
by Davidson’s newborn social system.

Running strong, but outclass-
ed in the News Piedmont Re-
lays, Davidson's tr ackmen
bounced back to set five Wof-
ford records in their three-team |
meet with Wofford and Pres-
byterian Tuesday.

Competing in the News Pied-
mont Relays against a field
composed of teams like Clem-
son, Brown, Maryland State, and
Furman (over a dozen schools
in all), the ‘Cats made a strong
showing.

Outstanding were Alan Turner,
who captured first place in the
100 yard dash with a time of
9.8 seconds, Bill Kendrick with
a 191'9" javelin toss worth third
place, and freshman Scott Sin-
nock’s second place pole vault.
Davidson relay teams captured
third place in the mile relay and
fourth place in the 440-yard and
two mile relays.

On Tuesday the trackmen
moved off the cinders and, for
the first time, onto an all weath-
er track at Wofford in a meet
with Wofford and Presbyterian.
The change failed to slow them
down. Five Wofford records
crumbled under the ‘Cats' fleet
feet.

The records were set by Alan
Turner, with a 9.8 in the 100;
Ronnie Reese with a 1:57.6 in the
880 yard run; Denny Phillips,
who had a 4:30.6 mile; John
Barrow with a 10:06 two-mile
run: and John Fagg who heaved
the shot put 446”,

The meet ended in a 83-50-27
victory for Davidson over sec-
ond-place Wofford and last place
Presbyterian.

The team's next meet comes
with the Davidson Relays on
Saturday of Spring Frolics.

Netters Are Undefeated in Conference

IMAC Softball

By TOM COOK
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Spring is here. And with
Spring at Davidson comes a
lazy, easy going sport known
as IMAC softball, where al-
most anyone can beat any-
one else on a given day.

Annual gripes about the sport
are again centered on the
groundrule double and the
short right field lines on some
fields. Most players feel it is
an unfair advantage and
prompts coaches to reject many
impressionable young students,
namely righthanded batters. A

The new officers — Hunter

(KA), ‘president; Jack Sherrill
(Beta), vice-president; and
Dave Townsend (ATO), secre-
tary—were finally chosen Mon-
day after two abortive election
attempts last week at which a
quorum for choosing officers
was not present. All the elect-
ed officers have served as
members on this year's council

Also at the meeting Monday
the IMAC ruled on a protest by
the Pi Kappa Phi swimming
team in the intramural meet.
The protest was against the
disqualification of the Pi Kapp
200-yard relay team when sev-
eral others of their fraternity’s
swimmers entered the pool be-
fore the last-place team in the
race had finished. Because the
regulation had not been made
clear (another team had earlier
in the meet violated the same
tule and had not been penal-
ized) and because the action
did not interfere with the last-
place team, the council voted

grinned newly elected IMAC president Tommy

10-0 to uphold the protest and
to refigure the point totals of
the swimming meet.

Sailors Hold Vote,

And Three Meets

Davidson's ‘blossoming sailing
team has elected its officers
for next fall and participated
in three meets since spring
break.

Chip Robertson and Chip Bel-
lamy were elected team com-
modores and Bill Dugger was
named team captain.

double. Still the various team
coaches manage noi to worry
too much over the situation
unless they are “hurting for

Around the court, the Pikas
have a solid infield built around
shortstop John Callend@r. The
Pikas are depending on knuckle-
ball artist Larry Outlaw to
pitch. Their main trouble is a
lack of dependable left-handed
hitters. Muldoon Briggs and
Lyle Smith have trouble even

The Kappa Sigs have Fred

Season Begins

The 1 Kapps admit to being
short on hitting ,but have strong
fielding. And could surprise
some good teams

The KA's have the hitting to
go with good defense led by
Tommy Hunter.

The Fijis looked good in beat-
in gthe Pi Kapps 9-1, behind
the two-hit pitching of Dale
Keller. This could be the team
to beat this year. They are
ready.

A spokesman for the Inde-
pendents invited all chronic
losers to join their team. “We
really get beat bad, but everv-
one seems to enjoy it,” he de-
clared with a puzzled look.

The Machis boast of their
third base-shortstop combina-
tion. Coach Jim Appleby noted,
“Greg Haynes and Lee Fan-
ning make the best left side
of the infield in the league.”
On hitting, Appleby said, ‘We
don't have any real big hitters
besides Dick Short who just hit
a pinch-hit triple a minute‘ago."’

The Betas have Tom Frist on

he mound, but have some trou-
bles in the loss of Jimmy Tim-
mons because of a dislocated
elbow.

The Phi Delts have Steve Da-
vidson, George Solley, -Phil
Squier, William Rikard and
Hugh Allen on the same dia-
mond and colud be the team to
beat if Allen’s pitching comes
around.

The ATO’s are a question

the Taus hopes in his well co-
ordinated fingers.

In recem games, the Sig Eps
beal the Pikas 14-10, the Inde
pendents lost to the Phi Deits
29-1 and to the Machis 18-3. The
KA's beat the Pi Kapps 7-1 and
the Nus 9-2. The SAE's lost to
the Kappa Sigs 5-1, beat the
Sig Eps 19-5, and the Betas
18-14. The Betas also dropped
a high scoring contest to the
Sigma Chis 21-16 last week. but
beat the ATO’s 6-2 on Monday.

The Sigma Nu's are weak but
still may pull some upsets off.
