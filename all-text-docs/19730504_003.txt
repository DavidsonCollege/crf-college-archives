Nixon Receives Little Sympathy Here

By TOM AINSWORTH
Contributing Editor

Who was it that supposedly
said ‘‘...but you can’t fool all of
the people all of the time’’? Oh,
yeah, it was the guy looking
over his left shoulder during the
President's speech on Monday
night, a fact in which Will Terry
took ‘‘much comfort.”

Nixon's speech and the whole
Watergate affair was one of the
major topics of conversation
during the past few days on the
Davidson campus, as it un-
doubtedly was over most of the
nation.

But being a_ so-called
academic community, THE
DAVIDSONIAN wanted to find
out how its members thought on
such an issue.

The student survey was the
most diverse of the opinions
received. Views ranged from
statements like “] thought it
was horrendous—Nixon didn't
make a conscientious effort to
get at the bottom of the mess” to
“IT think he (Nixon) handled it
right by not avoiding the issue.
Since he faced up to it, I respect
him for it.”’

Most of the students felt
however that Nixon had no
knowledge of the incident at the
time it happened, but were sure
that he had done some sort of
covering up since then, and that
his speech failed to clear him of
any implication in the scandal.

By far the most interesting
set of responses were those
given by the faculty and mem-
bers of the administration.

Professor of Economics Er-
nest F. Patterson indicated that
Nixon was “‘insulting the in-
telligence of the people for us to
expect that he was totally
ignorant of what happened.

Patterson also stated that

“Nixon is known for his fast
footwork, and he’s slippery and
eel-like in his opinions, beliefs,
and philosophies. His whole
past would lead him to attract
people of a low ethical nature
who would naturally do this sort
of thing."

“It was fairly reminiscent of
his Checkers speech,”’ con-
tinued Patterson, ‘‘in the way
that he attempted to shift the
emphasis from Watergate to
something else. He could have
recited the Lord's Prayer and it
still wouldn't have changed my
mind on the matter.”

Professor of Political Science
Winfred P. Minter thought that
the Watergate affair “‘represen-
ted a failure in the President's
leadership, since he’s been so
concerned with the mechanics
of staying in office and ap-
pealing to the groups most
likely to support him, that he
has overreacted to and
misjudged the opposition. "’

As to the question whether the
President had any knowledge of

the incident from the beginning,
Minter said that “in my mind.

there isn't any concrete evi-

dence to link him with it, but
there is a lot of circumstantial
evidence

“This is only the end of the
beginning. In the next few
months the trail might lead right

up to the door of the ova: uitice,
but not completely inside.’ he
said.

And to the general public's
reception of the President after
the incident and his. speech?
‘Most people in the country
want to believe that the
Presidency is above this sort of
thing and are hoping that this js
true, even if reason tells them
this isn’t so,"' answered Minter.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan reacted
to the question by calling it “‘a
scandal of the kind I think
would make any decent, con-
cerned citizen want to puke!

“I don't think Nixon's re-
sponse in any way makes
amends for what happened—it
won't change the credibility gap
created with the Administra-
tion, Bevan said.

‘I'm sorry for the Presiden-
cy: sorry in the sense that this
is the kind of image the world
attaches to us and our leader-
ship,”’ he continued.

The belief of Young
Republican leader George
Kaneklides also bordered on the
same lines as those who did not
support the President.

“I think that the whole affair
certainly tainted the Ad-
ministration in nearly every
way, ana will hamper dealings
with the Congress and his
dealings with the American

Dormitory Damage

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Asst. Managing Editor

Damage to student dor-
mitories at Davidson is a peren-
nial problem, and this year has
been no exception. Light grills,
windows, floors, ceiling tiles
and doors are among the most
frequently damaged fixtures.

“Generally, dorm damage
has been less these last several
years, though a little more ex-
tensive in freshman dorms this
year than last year,’’ com-
mented Dean of Students Will
Terry.

as usual, this trend usually
is in certain areas rather than
throughout the freshman
class,”’ he added.

The most flagrant damages
have been to the light grills in
Sentelle and Cannon dorms, ac-
cording to Terry. Many of these
expensive fixtures will have to
be replaced for next year.

Broken windows have also
been a problem in the freshman
dorms. “There seems to be
more window damage than
usual, and this relates to these
missles which are very
dangerous,”’ said Terry

At the end of first term,
the freshman class had been
billed for water damage to the
hall floors. The floors had to be
refinished, and this was an ex-
pensive process. About $2 was
added to each freshman's
January bill to cover the
damage caused by waterfights.

Also around Christmas, cer-
tain halls were billed for ad-
ditional damages. This fine
amounted to $138 overall.

Terry emphasized that some
of-the damage had been ac-
cidental, although there were

numerous cases of purposeful
damage, too.

He added that there has not
been a great deal of damage in
Belk, Richardson, Duke and
Little residence halls.
colleges.

Terry said that the main
reason for damages was that
people simply get in the habit of
doing it. He added that student
frustration also makes its con-
tribution.

“The most effective deterent
to damage is peer pressure.
Students need to take it upon
themselves to have respect for
one another,”’ Terry said.

The dean of students did not
agree with the policy of many.
colleges.

Often a college has a stan-
dard damage fee charged to
students at the beginning of
each year.

“‘This does not seem, to me at
least, to be the best way of han-
dling this,’ he said. Terry ad-
ded that this system invites
people to get their money’s
worth of damage.

In most cases, bills will be
charged to individual halls with
the hope that they in turn will
work out the best way to handle
the fine. ‘‘Somebody must
pay,” said Terry, ‘‘and if those
responsible won't, the money
must come out of the general
budget.

gaining in-depth insights into
the life of the people of French.

“The system will be used both
at Davidson and on the JYA
program in Montpellier,”
remarked French Professor
Frank Jacobus.

The cost of the entire system
is $10,000, which included two
cameras, monitors and $3000
worth of videotape. The equip-
ment is simple to operate and
can be assembled with a
minimum amount of _in-
struction.

Jacobus sees three goals for
the program. First, ‘to help
students on the JYA in France
deepen, diversify, and ar-
ticulate their contact with
French life while providing ex-
perience in the use of the TV
medium.

“To provide students on the
Davidson campus the kinetic
and visual aspects of in-
ene communication in

French which are almost en-

tirely lacking from the present
program.

“And finally to provide
students on the Davidson cam-
pus a concrete awareness of the
‘Deep culture’ of French life,”’
Jacobus stated.

“Previously the Junior Year
Abroad program has not given
the students the insight into
French culture as it was in-
tended,”’ he said.

An example of such a film
documentary would be a study
of a French cafe.

““By tne making of documen-
tary type films by the JYA
students, both those abroad as
well as the on-campus students
should profit,’’ added Jacobus.

One subject, being un-
dertaken by sophomore Tom
Nicoll, involves the study of
racism in France today, which
is directed towards the Arabs.

The videotape as well as in-
terviews and research will be
utilized in this project.

Though the French depart-
ment instituted the purchase of
the videotape system, Jacobus
stresses that it could and should
be used by other departments
as well.

“The TV system could be in-
valuable as a method of teacher
self-evaluation,’ stated
Jacobus.

Drama productions could also
use the videotape for work in
evaluation and correction.

Jacobus hoped that the
student body would express an
interest in the new TV system.

He said that television has
gained a definate foothoid on
the Davidson campus and he
hoped that students will realize
the value of the system ’as a
means of going about a project.

Anyone interested in the

videotape system should con-
tact Jacobus.

The cost of the system will be
financed i an outside
