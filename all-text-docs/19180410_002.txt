The booming of the big guns over at
Kings Mountain brings the war closer
home to us. Have you bought a U. 8.
Liberty Bond?

Defeating every one on the Southern
trip last week makes the State champion-
ship look promising.

It’s the same old game. Item from
The Davidson Monthly, April, 1888:
“Pitching horse-shoes is quite the rage
now with the boys,”

CONCENTRATION.

As an illustration of a student's lack
of concentration, do you know anyone
who answers to the following descrip-
tion? He comes to college with the
best of intentions for hard work and a
thoro education, yet his methods of study
are such that on the whole he does poor
work and injures himself mentally and
physically. Trace briefly his day of
work and this will be evident. A short
while after dinner he sits down in his
room to “study.” It is not long before
Something outside his window attracts
his attention. His mind begins to wander
from his book and he passively allows
it to roam about from place to place,
recalling this and that. This happens
frequently during the afternoon, while
his book lies open before him the whole
time, and he wonders by supper time
why he has covered so little and why he
knows so little about what he has cov-
ered,

He takes little or no exercise, so that
by evening when he attempts to get
back to work again, he is restless, his
nerves are high-strung, and his mind
grogey, due to the close confinement to
his room all afternoon and no exercise.
At this time also he uses no effort to
keep his mind on his work. His rest-
lessness induces him to loaf about and
engage in conversation with his fellow
students, and the light has “winked” be-
fore he has well prepared his tickets, In
the morning he spends his empty periods
in the same way, and becomes discour-
aged when he repeatedly gets “shot” on
class after “working” so hard. It is not
long before he begins to feel a little out

The DAVIDSONIAN, April 10, 1918

of sorts and to be troubled with head-
aches. He realizes the cause and goes
to the other extreme: takes violent ex-
ercise and turns in at night at nine-thirty
or ten, As soon, however, as he feels
better, he immediately returns to his old
ways—lack of exercise, sleep, and con-
centration. If he only knew what in
jury he was doing himself, he might
think twice over it. He is aware him-
self that he is getting in bad condition
and is physically run down, and it would
ceem that the knowledge of a probable
breakdown in health in the near future
would be a warning to him.

‘The more he practices inattention and
mind wandering, the harder it will be
for him to concentrate in after life; and
inability to concentrate has been called
the most pitiful affliction a man may
have in any profession. Concentration
cannot be taught; it can only be ac-
quired by continually keeping a check on
the mind and by driving it the whole
time. Nor can the best concentration
he obtained unless the body and mind are
in the best condition—a result of regu-
lar exercise and plenty of sleep, to-
also with other conditions which enter
in. It is possibly out of place to be
handing out “medical advice” from
these columns; vet in these times of pre-
paredness a man owes it to his country
if not to himself to keep his body in the
best posstble shape, thus holding it ready
for any service the authorities may re-
quire of it. With proper concentration
such a student can do the same work in
half the. time; he can do it more thor-
oly and accurately; and then will have
all the time he needs for other activi-
ties—even for loafing. Try it and sec
if it’s not so.

ORGANIZED TENNIS.

Tennis so far at Davidson has been
considered a second-rate form of ath-
letics. However, steps are now on foot
to have a.certain amount of the blanket
fee apportioned to tennis, financing the
tournaments and any intercollegiate
matches which may be scheduled. As it
is now, the expenses .of such a match
must be defrayed from heavy individual
entrance fees, which make a man think
twice before signing up for the tourna-
ment. With the financial backing of the
student body this sport would perceptibly
increase in importance and interest.

This naturally brings us to the con-
sideration of our home equipment, and
here it may be said with truth that there
are not but two, or possibly threc, courts
on the Hill that are fit to play tennis on
and get fun out of it. Two years ago
ground was leveled and wired off for
twelve courts behind the outdoor gym.
Yet no one seems to have charge of them
and now they are in such condition, that
they might be used for playing “round
cat” or pitching horse-shoes. It is very
evident that the college is unable to help
in anv way, as the war has reduced
everything to the strictest economy to
make ends meet. Consequently it rests
with the tennis players among the stu-
dents to do something with regard to
this. The following is a suggestion.
which, if carried out, should not entail
any great expenses and which should put
these twelve courts into first-rate play-
ing condition.

work, and expense of properly draining
them, clearing them off and rolling them
into good shape, moving the backstops
five or ten feet back, and finally of keep-
ing them up. Then let the members do
this themselves, every man being expect-
ed to participate equally in the work.
Or should this not be practicable or
agreeable, let each man he assessed
enough so that the total will cover the
expenses, and pay several students to

on the courts. We have no idea as to
what this would cost, but surely it is Musical Homes

worth while to consider it and make
available to the students twelve splen-
did courts; so that no one need get
“ducks” on a court and have to wait half
the afternoon for an opportunity to play.
We hope some thought and action will

interested in tennis, as more students
take part in this activity than in any oth-
er sport on the campus.

THE FORUM.

‘The Forum department has certainly
not been overworked this past year and
vet we feel sure that this does not mean
that there are no ideas and suggestions
for the improvement of the college in
the minds of students and alumni ‘There-
fore we earnestly request the students to
contribute to the Forum column any
criticism, either constructive or destruct-
ive, for by putting up to the public a
problem someone may be led to think
aver it and possibly arrive at some con-
clusion; also any ideas and suggestions
as to improvements on the campus, the
management of any collegiate activity,
the policies of the student body or any
subject which may be of interest to any-
one. The alumni are also urged to keep
the college in mind and any advice they
may send us we will be glad to print if
thev so desire. All such communications
to the Forum must of course bear the
signature of the author, tho it will not
he published if he so request.
