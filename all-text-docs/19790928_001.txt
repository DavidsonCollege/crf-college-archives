New organization questions quality of education here —

By SHERI GRAVETT
Staff Writer

Is Davidson spending its
money wisely? Finding answers
to this question is the goal of a
new student group on campus,
the Coalition for Better Educa-
tion, according to member
Steve Austin.

The Coalition is the source of
two posters seen on campus this
week, one comiparing the foot-
ball budgets of Davidson and
Southwestern at Memphis, the
other noting a rise in David-
son’s student/faculty ratio.

The Coalition, which now has
approximately 15 members,
was organized early this fall out
of casual discussion among its
members, Austin said.

According to member Susan
Marynowski, the Coalition
seeks to engender a re-evalua-
tion of present College budget

.priorities through its efforts.

Member Elliot Hipp said the
Coalition members are con-
cerned that “‘the priorities of the
school: aren’t being addressed
the way the budget is now set
up. There are major problems
such as the rising student/fac-
ulty ratio, low faculty pay, and
registration that should be of
utmost concern.”’

Group members feel, as Todd”

‘Spatiord pointed out, that
is making a commit-
a an area where we can’t

gee qieaticn the value
of “big time” athletics to any
small college. They add, how-
ever, that they are not “‘anti-
football” or against any other
sport, but they do question the
amounts of money spent of
sports here. |

“I go to every football game
and I enjoy it,” says member
Eugene Heath, “There are in-
trinsically good things to athle-
tics, but not at the expense of
academics.”

Austin said that response ‘to
their group has been “encour-
aging.” The original members

‘of the group included Austin,

Students will decide the fate
of Davidson’s NC-PIRG chap-
ter in a referendum to be held
October 9.

The referendum, voted in by
the SGA Wednesday night,
asks that students either ap-
prove or disapprove of PIRG’s
continued existence and its
funding procedures. =~

Until this past year, four
dollars were automatically ad-
ded to each student’s compre-
hensive fee to fund PIRG.

PAC institutes student course evaluation forms to begin this term

By JOHN SIMAN
Assistant News Editor
Students will complete evalu-
ation forms on all their profess-
ors beginning this term, accord-
ing to Professional Affairs Com-
ittee Chairman Anthony Ab-

The new evaluation system
will inform both the adminis-
tration and the professors them-
selves about students’ reactions
to courses, Abbott said.

Student evaluation forms
were last used fall term 1975,
when the forms were phased
out, according to Sociology
Professor Norm Koller. Alth-
ough in January, 1976, the
faculty voted that a replace-
ment should be found for the
old form, no student evaluation
system has been in operation
since then, Koller said.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs Price Zimmermann said
that, ‘‘It is specified in the
Code(of Faculty Evaluation
Procedures) that students have
a role to play in the evaluation
process.’’ Abbott also stated
the need for student input on a
“regular basis” through a “‘uni-
form system.”

The form has two parts.
First, students respond to three
“global” questions asked about

all professors. The students.

1)rate the course content, 2)
rate the instructor, and 3) rate
the course in general. The data

from the ‘“‘global’’ questions will .

be used to inform the adminis-
tration on student opinion.

The second part of the form
consists of 23 questions chosen

by the professor being evalua-
ied. The professor selects his
questions from a master list of
623 questions, and only the
professor himself is informed of
the results, Abbott said. The
purpose of this part, according
to Zimmermann, is to enable
‘‘professors to improve their
teaching in any way possible.’’
The University of Illinois
developed the form. Zimmer-
mann and the Professional Aff-
airs Committee (PAC) selected
it to be used at Davidson,
Abbott said, “‘all agreed it was
the best we could get.”’
Psychology Professor Brock-
way praised its ‘‘very reliable
results.” He also pointed: out
that the forms have been. care-

fully designed so that expected
grades will have no bearing on
the students’ ratings of profess-
ors.
Brockway emphasized that the
forms. can help professors spot
and correct their weaknesses.
He used the form last spring
term and included a question
that asked if he spoke too fast.
The-response that students
generally understood him well
made him more confident in his
lecturing... .
The use ore

forms was

explained ‘to the faculty Wed-

nesday afternoon. On October 8
a meeting will b@ held for
professors $0 they can comment
on a raise further questions

about the forms, Abbottt said.

Bank introduces Wildcat checking

By ELIZABETH KISS
Staff Writer

Piedmont Bank and Trust,
Davidson’s only bank, has ad-
ded a new option for its check-
ing account customers: the
Wildcat Checking plan.

According to Assistant
Cashier and Loan Officer Fran-
ces Sherrill, the plan allows the
account holder to write 1 to 10
checks for a monthly fee of $2.
Additional checks are 20 cents
each. There is no minimum
balance-required.

Sherrill. said the plan is
designed for students who pre-
fer to know. exactly how much
their service charge will be. It

_ will help students who usually

keep small amounts in their

“accounts.

The new plan is offered in ..

addition to Piedmont’s regular
checking system, which aroused
mixed feelings among*students

when it was instituted in De-

cember 1978.
Under the regular plan, there

‘is a monthly service charge of

$1 plus 20 cents per check,
Sherrill said. A percentage of
the average monthly balance,
presently 5 percent annually, is
then deducted from the fee..
For example, if a customer
had an average balance of $200
and wrote five checks, his or her
service chargé would be $2
minus one-twelfth of the annual
interest rate of 5 percent, or 83
cents. The monthly payment

would be $1.17.

Abbott added that the new
forms “‘have not been adopted
permanently.’’ They will be
used for six terms and then re-
evaluated by»the PAC, he said.

According to Abbott, a stud-
ent can complete the form in
about 20 to 30 minutes. Profess-
ors will distribute their forms

near the end of the term:

Abbott emphasized that stud-
ents will not have to complete
the forms during exam period,
lest they regard the forms as a
“‘nuisance”’ and give them curs-
ory attention.

Abbott said that the forms
allow “a systematic sampling of.
student opinion.” Zimmermann
added that the new system is a

future of Davidson NC-PIRG

Those not wishing to support
PIRG had to deduct four dollars
from the bill.

College President Samuel
Spencer decided last spring to
sulted in a drop of. Davidson
PIRG funds from $400 to $200. .

The $200 came from those
who added the four dollars onto
the bill themselves.

Spencer has indicated that he
will reverse his decision if the
student body wishes. In the
September 14 issue of The
Davidsonian, he is. quoted as
saying, “If the. student body
wants (the old funding system),
it will be reinstated. It is their
choice.”

NC-PIRG State Co-Director
Elisa Wolper said that unless
the referendum is successful,
PIRG will not have enough
financial stability to continue
operation at Davidson.

She said, ‘‘It’s foolish to
begin anything unless you know
you will have the. funds to
complete it. The:
system ded. us
security we need.”

Wolper does not feel that
PIRG’s special funding system
is unfair. ‘‘If a majority of
students are willing to support
PIRG, and minority rights are
protected, then it is a just
system.”

She said that those who
