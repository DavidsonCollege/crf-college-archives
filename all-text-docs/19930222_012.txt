Men's Tennis Knocks Off University of Virginia
5-2 Victory Ends Davidson's Seven Year Losing Streak vs. ACC

By Brannon Buck

With a bastion of crowd sup-
port, an inspirational speech from
captain Albie Varoski; and a “never
say die” attitude, the Davidson Men’s
Tennis Team defeated The Univer-
sity of Virginia on Saturday for ‘its
first win over an ACC team in seven
years, Coach Frank’s team actually
dominated the match, winning by a
score of 5-2, which could have eas-
ily been worse.

On Friday, Davidson passed a
tough test on the way to Virginia by
defeating East Carolina 5-2. Against
ECU, the team struggled in the
doubles but played strong singles to
win at every position except number

Men's Basket-
ball Falls to
UTC, App. St.

By Bruce Balestier

With so much on the line in
Saturday afternoon’s game at Belk
Arena against Appalachian State,
you might have expected more of
the Davidson basketball team. With
a chance to bury the reeling Moun-
taineers, losers of five straight, be-
neath them in the conference stand-
ings and all but lock up a top-six

- finish in the league, the Wildcats
faltered instead. Davidson (10-13,
7-8) never came up with the defen-
sive stop it needed, and App State’s
Billy Ross coaxed in a25-foot three-
pointer with three seconds left to
give his team a 79-76 win,

Ross, the second-leading scorer
in the Southern Conference at more
than 24 points a game, finished with
32 points, including seven three-

- pointers. His winning shotconcluded
a final minute and a half of action in
which Davidson several times failed
to capitalize on chances to win the
game.

J.D. Heuer tied the game at 76
with 1:29 to go when he made the
frontendofaoneand one, butmissed
the second (a72% free throw shooter,
Heuer finished one for five at the
line). The Wildcats retained posses-
sion though, when the rebound went
out of bounds off an App. State
player, and Detlef Musch was fouled
on the ensuing inbounds play. But
he missed the front end of the one
and one, and the Mountaineers took
possession with 1:27 to play.

Freshman Brandon Williams,
inserted into the lineup for Janko
Narat inan effort to stop Ross, forced
him into an off-balance miss from
17 feet with 50 seconds left, but
ASU’s Nod Carter claimed the re-
bound, and the Mountaineers reset
the offense. Williams further ha-
rassed Ross with just over 10 sec-
onds left by lunging forward to de-
flect a pass into the backcourt. As
the two players pursued the ball near
midcourt, Williams went down, per-
haps pushed by Ross, who claimed
the ball and took it the other way.

five. Albie Varoski stood out by
winning his singles and doubles
matches.

In both matches this week-
end, the Cats utilized the new
collegiate match format to their
advantage. This new formatstarts
with the doubles teams playing
an “eight game pro-set” (which-
ever team wins two of the three
doubles matches gets one point),
then the singles are played count-
ing one pointapiece. Against both
ECU and UVA, Davidson
dropped one point in the doubles
competition, but nullified it with

“strong singles play.
Early on during the Virginia

match, it appeared as if Davidson
might fall just short once again of
what it needed to beat an ACC
school. In the doubles, Russell
Briggs and Ryan Harper played an
amazing match at number one, de-
feating the Cavaliers 8-1. Even
though the Cats lost at number
three, David Jespersen and Holt
Vaughan were on their way to a
victory at number two. But after
serving for the match twice and
being up 5-2 at one point during
the tie-breaker, they ended up los-
ing the match. Davidson dropped
the first point to Virginia, and it
looked like the “ACC- curse” was
taking effect.

Things turned around imme-
diately in the singles. Vaughan
played an outstanding match, win-
ning 6-1,6-3 atnumbertwo. Briggs
saved four set points to come from
behind and win 7-6, 6-3 at number
four. Daniel Grinnan won in three
sets 4-6,6-1,6-1, and Dave
Tonidandel smothered his oppo-
nent 6-4,6-3. In by far the most
“gutty” performance of the day,
Jespersen overcame severe muscle
spasms in his back to pull out a 6-
3,1-6,6-3 victory at number three.

Once it was all over, Davidson
had claimed a 5-2 victory that left
Varoski in hysterics. “I told the
team that this was the seniors’ last

Davidson Accused of Sexism
in Cancelling Basketball Game

By Robert Lloyd-Still

According to the Charlotte
Observer on Saturday, February
20, two Davidson professors
accussed the Davidson Athletic
Department of sexism in the can-
cellation of a women’s basket-
ball game. Davidson was sup-
posed to play Radford on Mon-
day, February 15, but the game
wascancelledtoallow the UNCC
men’s basketball team to play
Furman.

UNCC was unable to play at
the Coliseum, because Neil Dia-
mond needed to prepare for his
concert the next day, Davidson
received $4,500 for allowing
UNCC to play at Davidson. The

two Davidson professors, David
Martin (Economics) and Mary
Anne Moore (Physics), plan to
present a two page resolution at the
next faculty meeting.

Martin, an economics profes-
sor, and Moore, a physics profes-
sor, told the Observer that the
schedule change “humiliated the
women’s team”. The professors
ended the resolution by adding that,
“Davidson College should not be a
sexist, money-grubbing institu-
tion.” Martin and Moore want the
school to release public apologies
tothe Radford and Davidson teams.

Davidson Athletic Director
Terry Holland defended the deci-
sion by arguing that the switch

generated a considerable amount
of money for Davidson athletics.
Holland offered to reschedule the
game during the day, but Coach
John Filar only wanted to play at
night. Filar stated in Saturday’s
Charlotte Observer, “It’s a very
lousy time to play a game. We’d
have been playing it basically dur-
ing the dinner hour. It would have
been virtually impossible for any-
body toattend. AndI don’t want to
be the lead-in to a UNC-Charlotte
men’s game.” However, Filar be-
lieved that no apology was neces-
sary and he commended the job
Holland has done for women’s ath-
letics at Davidson.

chance at an ACC team and to go
out there and bust ass. I also said
that if we got down, we couldn’t
give up. And we didn’t.” Coach
Frank was jubilant as well, attrib-
uting the win to the players’ hard
work and the excellentcrowd-sup-
port.

The victory leaves Davidson
at 5-0 in dual match competition
this year. The next home match is
on Tuesday at 4:00 against South
Carolina, who is ranked top-ten in
the nation. The Cats will be trying
to improve on their performance
as they gun fora big upset over this
SEC powerhouse.

‘Hooff, Bickers

Set School
Records in
Southern
States Classic

By Will Cobb

Throughoutthe year freshman
standout Churchill Hooffof Lorton,
Virginia, has repeatedly produced
impressive times. On Friday night,
he did the unexpected by capturing
first place at the Southern States
Championships in the 500 meter
freestyle with a personal best of
4:40.19. Notonly was ita personal
best, but a school best, a Southern
States Championships best, and
even a pool best. He became the
school’s first medal recipient at
the event, and the future cannot
wait to see what else he may ac-
complish.

Another outstanding perfor-
mance was put in by Senior cap-
tain Curtis Bickers from Memphis,
Tennessee who finished third in
the one meter diving competition
with a personal best that broke the
Davidson school record for points
total after 11 dives. He was the
second Davidson competitor to
pick up a medal by earning the
bronze.

The diving teams did very well
as the men’s group picked up 43
points, while the women gathered

. 48. In Saturday night’s competi-

tion, Jennifer Schuetz reached the
medal round in the 400 Meter Indi-
vidual, This meet closed out the
season for the team, a season that
has been quite successful. The
team will anxiously await next year
to build on this year’s all around
substantial improvement.
