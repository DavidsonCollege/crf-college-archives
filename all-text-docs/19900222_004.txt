Here is the panel discussion on German
reunification that you may have missed

By JAY J. CHAUDHURI

Dr. Louis L. Ortmayer, Profes-
sor of Political Science, Davidson
College:

Itisa very timely topic... the
wall, the changes, the elections,
the vast number of events that
arts occurring daily ... it’s
almost to the place where each
hour something new is hap-
pening and one waits for the
latest facts to come in with the
latest policy statement and so
forth... thesubject of change in
the Germanies involves not
only interests but a great deal
of speculation, and also in
many quarters fears... And yet
there area variety of issues that
people are looking at closely to
see if the unification is brought
about. European unification
and Europe 1992 is now in
many. ways a new subject of
revision and concern . . . The
Atlantic alliance and the agree-
ment of the two plus four talks
which will occur after the East
German elections . . . brings
about security issues including
that of the Warsaw pact or its
successor organization. There
is the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe...

which will become increas-
ingly important . . . The year of
elections will be extremely
important not just for Germans
in East and West but for Euro-
peans generally and also I
would say for Americans. And
finally economicand monetary
union, not just a powerful eco-
nomic Germany and powerful
economic Europe, you will
have many vital influencesand
impact upon our lives and an
increasingly interdependent
economic world. A Germany
which is a revitalized and
large, and certainly, very im-
portant competitor.

Mr. Klaus Franke, Member of the
Christian Democratic Party in the
West German Bundestag (Parlia-
ment) from Hamburg:

Nixon once told us “the
twentieth century was the most
bloody century in history” We
have the chance for us and our
children and grandchildren to
step into a new century with-
out war and oppressive in Eu-
rope... The change we face in
Poland, Hungary, especially
Hungary and Czechoslovakia
was one of the key elements for
the change that now takes

place inGermany. The reunifi-
cation is on its way, in many
sense, and nobody wants to
stop it, neither the United
States nor the Soviets .. .
There’s still alot todo, not only
among us, the Germans, but
also, by stabilizing the young
democracies in Poland and
Czechoslovakia, and the
change which might take place
within Bulgaria and Romania.
. One main step on the way of
reunification will be the elec-
tions which take place on the
18th of MarchintheGDR. And
we the parliamentarians from
West Germany, but all people
in my country or from my part
of the country, we are very
involved to help our friends in
the GDR to be successful in
these election because they
have not only an impact to the
transschedule of reunification
and to thesituationintheGDR,
but I’m quite sure that the re-
sults coming out from these
elections also have a great
impact on our elections which
will take place on the 2nd of
December this year.

Mr. Alexander von Schmeling,
Consul General of the Federal
Republic of Germany, Atlanta:

The reunification of Ger-
many certainly has great inter-
national implications. When
the East Germans went to the
streets in the summer last year
the word “reunification” was
no issue. They wanted liberty,
freedom; they wanted to be
able to go to West Germany.
Reunification came up only
after the first emotions of free-
dom and free movement were
over. But since then reunifica-
tion is the issue . . . we can
finally really say nobody is of-
ficially anymore against reuni-
fication . . . Now it is a reality,
and it took some time of per-
suasion, education, not so
much by us, but by more
knowledgeable people of their
own nation. Our gallup polls,
we have made in Western
countries and Sweden and
Poland, which were not con-
ducted by German agencies
but by local agencies show
overwhelming support by the
population for reunification,
just in Poland it is not so over-
whelming. But in all the other
countries the people really see
no danger in German reunifi-
cation, that is particularly true
for young people . . . The Ger-
man reunification is first and

Ambassador: Great
task ahead for GDR

By JOE MARIS

Norbert Reemer, the acting
GDRambassador to the United
States, was the key speaker at
last week’s conference on Ger-
man reunification. According
to Reemer, the biggest problem
facing the GDR and the FGR is
the adaption of the GDR into a
democratic framework. The
task will be great, he said.

The GDR can bring into the
process the defeat of socialism,
a structure of East German
ideas, a highly developed labor
force and a highly developed
culture.

According to Reemer, the

’ GDR is a socialist state but a

“retarded socialist state” that

‘has suffered from a failing

economy, a severe police sys-
tem, and disruptive political
thinking. The GDR was in a
poor position, he continued,

and change became necessary -

to ensure the survival of the
state. After changes in Moscow
and a quiet revolution in the

Church, German people took
to the streets and last October,
the government toppled, he
reported.

Reemer addressed the pro-
posed integration of the two
economies, the placing of mili-
tary power completely in the
West and the stabilization of
East German democracy. Reu-
nification will also unite the
mostly homogeneous ethnic
Germans with one another, he
stated.

Klaus Francke, a member of
the West German Bundestag,
closed the session by encourag-
ing Americans to: “help us
Europeans stabilize the way of
a new democracy,” so that
Europe could live together “in
a unified European house in
peace and freedom for all of
us.”

The Johns Hopkins Institute
for Contemporary German
Studies collaborated with the
Dean Rusk program to present
the two-day conference.

y

foremost a German affair. It is

‘ Germany which decides about

itsown future and therefore we
must be the ones who have to
decide it... The other complex
is economic one.. . . Economi-
cally, we are also not so com-
pletely free anymore. Wearea
staunch member of the Euro-
pean EconomicCommunity ...
we will certainly not do any-
thing without having dis-
cussed anything with our
friends from the West. The last
question is the neutrality and
NATOand soon... Inthe field
of how we will fix that security
problem Iamatacomplete lost.

Dr. Wolfgang Nicolai, Visiting
professor from the Institute for
International Law and Politics,
Potsdam, German Democratic Re-
public:

I think from the point of view
from the East German people
the itis nearly the most impor-
tantand mosturgent question -
to create such.a monetary un-
ion. We have to see the situ-
ation in Eastern Germany is
nowadays characterized at
first that every day nearly 2000
or more people leave the coun-
try; and secondly, the eco-
nomic life weakens day by day,
of course, as a result of the
crush down of centralized
planned economy which we
had in our part of Germany for
40 years .. . It is quite clear that
the policy of subsidizing, for _
instance food stocks and other
consumer goods, lost fifty bil-
lion East German marks and
we would have never been able
to continue it in the 1990s.
After the revolutionary situ-
ation ... all the economic prob-
lems could be seen more and
more . .. our industries needs
the necessity of modernization

. Furthermore, we have a
terrible environment . . . Fur-
thermore, we have a situation
in our cities in which down-
towns froma historical point of
view, valuable buildings are
crumbling. No investment
exists which is necessary to
prevent such development
which we now have. Wenearly
have forty years . . in which
nothing was done in this field .
. . After opening the wall, the
wants of people to travel have
increased . . . and that is per-
fectly understandable . . . The
situation for the people has
become more and more hope-
less, and we are now con-
fronted that we havetodosuch
step to boast jobs and espe-
cially the Federal Republic,
from an economic point of
view, can assist in Such steps. .
. | completely agree with the
policy of the government in
Bonn; the best way is a cur-
rency union .. . It is the way
which would not be very pain-
ful for our people . .. [hope we
will have the chance to better:
