Gridiron Battle

The powerful Camp Davis Blue
Brigade rolled over a fighting Da-
son College eleven 27 to0 on Oc-
tober 23 before an audience of 15,-
000 servicemen.

The Soldiers, following a punt ex-
change, took over near midfield and
launched a drive which resulted in
their first tally. Led by Stoeckel
and Bisceglia, the Blue Brigade
smashed its way to the Davidson 1
where Bisceglia hurdled the line for
the score. Provenzano’s placement
attempt was wide and the ‘Cats
trailed 6-O.

Davidson took Provenzano’s kick-
off and, failing to gain against the
massive Soldier line, was forced to
punt. Ashmore was badly rushed,
his poor kick wobbling out on the
Wildcat 35. Once again the Blue
Brigade went into high gear. Fol-
lowing a 4-yard gain, Bisceglia
broke through the Cat line and
bulled his way to the 4 before he
was halted by Crane and Ashmore.
On the next play, Neblecki crashed
into the end zone for the second
touchdown. Soloman converted to

converted. The scrappy ‘Cats

fore the half ended.

the favored South Carolina Coast
Guard eleven, 36 to 0 in their first

home appearance of the season.
After a scoreless first period in
which the Cats slightly outgained
their rivals, the Coast Guard ma-
chine drove deep into Davidson
territory where Henderson put his
mates in the lead with a field goal
from the Cat 16. A few minutes
later the Sailors struck paydirt again
on a “sleeper” pass from Spencer
to Lancaster which chicked 53 yards
and a touchdown. Henderson con-
verted to give the South Carolina

club a commanding 10 to 0 lead.}|

Just before the half ended, Adamiec

Season In Game With
Tigers “i

Following the open date this week
the Davidson Wilcats encounter the
Clemson Tigers in Charlotte. It will
be the Cats’ second conference game
of the season and they are looking
for their first victory.

Clemson will probably enter the
game as favorites but the Wildcats
will have plenty of time to prepare
»themselves and are determined to
defeat Coach Frank Howard team.
Clemson will feel the loss of Mar-
ion Bulter, star tailback, who is
entering the army a few days before
the game, but they are grooming
several freshmen who will be able
to take over.

Whitmire Clemson Star

Don Whitmire, 180 pound wing-
back, will be the man the Cats will
have to watch. Whitmire is a speedy,
powerful runner who fits in well
with the reverses and spins that are
always prominent in the Tiger’s at-
tack.

No Serious Injuries

Davidson will enter the game
at full strength since no serious
injuries were sustained in the bruis-
\ing attack of Camp Davis. The
passing combinations with Ashmore

and Watt and Williams doing most

way to paydirt. After Provenzano
and Santone had colaborated for
two first downs, Norm Standlee,
former All-Pro fullback ctashed
through the Davidson line for 13
yards. Two plays later Standlee,
with a tremendous surge of power,
biasted his way into scoring terri-
tory for the final Davis 6-pointer.
Mellus, Captan of the Blue Brigade,
booted the point.

In- the final minutes, Flowers
snatched Scofield’s pass from the air
and, behind neat. downfield block-
ing, romped to the AA 7 before he
was downed. The Blue Brigade
rose up, however, and averted the
threat.

counted for all the ‘Cats yardage

attempt was blocked. Early in the
final quarter, Taggart swept the
Davidson end, and behind beautiful
blocking, romped 48 yards for the
fourth marker. Henderson’s boot
was wide. The final Coast Guard
score came late in the quarter when
Henderson intercepted Scofield’s
pass and ran 40 yards. The husky
back kicked the extra point to
end the Sailors’ scoring parade. The
Cats tried desperately to make their
passing attack connect throughout
the game, but the Coast Guards-
men’s 5-3-2-1 defense held thei at
a standstill.

The Davidson attack showed little
power throughout the game. In-
juries suffered by Ashmore early
in the game hurt the Presbyterian
effort severely. Bryant ~ Monroe

did Captain Sam Hay who played
