‘Which Way Fraternities?

The Interfraternity Council’s pro-
posal for making fraternity affiliation
available to every member of the stu-
dent body is an encouraging - one.
Though fraternities waited for a facul-
ty dictum before they started to move,
they did go beyond the faculty guide-
lines in a number of cases. It's difficult
to pin down the committee’s motives:
Probably they stem from a combina-
tion of pragmatism, in recognition of
faculty scepticism toward fraternities
in general, and altruism, from a real
concern for the person not invited to
join a fraternity.

It will never be possible under a
situation arbitrarily discriminating
among individuals to have an ideal

system. The stigma will still be there, ,

for the people that really count. |
The IFC’s committee took pains to
point out the measures that will erase
distinctions between those that re-
ceived bids and those that didn’t. Most
significant of these measures is the
alternative given to those receiving
bids to become either pledges or so-

cial affiliates. Consequently, it will be_

unclear to those outside a particular
fraternity and the fraternity presi-
dents whether a particular person is a
social affiliate by choice or from
necessity.

Nevertheless, the individual himself

Draft Alternative

Recent days have brought, happily
or unhappily, as the case may be, at
least an indication of what treatment
draft-eligible males may expect from
their friendly local boards. True, no-
thing concrete has come out yet, but
one thing is clear: those in the know
currently have no intention of provid-
ing any sort of alternative to military
service.

Students are in the process of cir-
culating a petition to be presented to
the President, asking him to consider
instituting some tvpe of alternative to
military service. Strong support by the
entire student body could go a long
way toward making the petition effort
a success. With strong support from an
overwhelming segment of the student
body and faculty, and coordinated pe-
titions from neighboring institutions,
it would be difficult for Mr. Johnson
to completely ignore such a request.

Experts on the war in Vietnam have
repeatedly emphasized that the signi-
ficant aspects of the war are found
not so much in the military as they
are in the social and economic spheres.
The same is true of any area where the
U.S. wants to erect a bulwark against
Communist gains. Yet so far, the main
means of detering communism have
been either military or financial, with
little real encouragement of such
grass-roots programs as the Peace

TDs.

Allowed a choice of what form of
service they may pursue, draft-age stu-
dents would be much more agreeable
to participating in some government
program. But there would be no mad
rush to join a service program — it
wouldn’t be an easy way out. Peace
Corps pay would be much lower and
the hours longer; duty in obscure
countries, often with little or no con-
tact with Westerners, is far from a bed
of roses. Many men would still prefer
to give their service in the military,
certainly enough to satisfy the pres-
ent needs of 50 per cent of the draft-
age males. :

A Peace Corps recruiter who spent
several days on campus this week can

will know that he didn’t receive a bid,
as will the members of the house to
which he is assigned. Consequently,
much of the success of the new sys-
tem will depend on how willing frater-
nities are to make it work, to make
social affiliates assigned to their house
feel at home.

The social affiliate-pledge choice
may well be the most significant as-
pect of the plan, though for reasons
committee members did not intend.
To the knowledgeable student, the ad-
vantages of the more flexible social af-
filiation over pledgeship and eventual
membership are so obvious and over-
whelming that the day may come when
fraternities have no more pledges.

Unless one places a great stock in
the. nebulous promises of brotherhood
gained by entrance into the national
organization, he will have no reason to
be bound by restrictions of chapter
membership. The advantages of social
life, food and house use are undi-
minished.

The IFC may have signed its own
death warrant, unintentionally, of
course. If the system works, it may
work too well. If fraternity men refuse
to let it work, another, more drastic
plan may be implemented. At any
rate, the .present plans offers new
hope for the immediate future.

‘testify to the fact that interest in the

Peace Corps is far from overwhelming.
However, the lack of interest stems
not so much from an apathy toward
the plight of others, but rather from
the sense of futility that stems from
knowing Uncle Sam’s Army wants you
as soon as your two-year stint with
the Peace Corps is up.

Last spring Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara said: “It seems to
me that we pen patra rem
edying (the draft) ineq y asking
every young person in the United
States to give two years of service to
his country—whether in one of the
military services, in the Peace Corps,
or in some other volunteer develop-
mental work at home or abroad. . . . It
would make meaningful the central
concept of security: a world of de-
cency and development—where every
man can feel that his personal horizon
is rimmed with hope.”

And President Johnson, also last
spring: “We must revive the ancient
ideal of citizen soldiers who answer
their nation’s call in time of peril. We
need them on battlefronts where no
guns are heard but freedom is no
less tested.”

Bloody Good Beer

When it comes to blood drives, the
University of Virginia has it all over
Davidson. And lagging participation
here suggests we may do well to adapt
ourselves to the U.Va. system.

Instead of merely offering donors
a Coke and the leading fraternity a
plaque, according to Davidson tradi-
tion, thé Wahoos’ union offers a free
keg of beer to all organizations boast-
ing a 100 per cent turnout for the an-
nual drive. Some fraternities, having
already participated in a separate
Greek drive, are making the supreme
sacrifice and giving again.

The situation is not without its
its faults, however. One promising
improvement to boost participation
might come from giving the beer be-
fore, rather than after, donation. It's
the painless way to do it.

Idea Of A Christian Faculty

While things in Davidson have been
quiet since the trustees removed the
notorious Faculty Vow several years
ago, the situation at Agnes Scott Col-
lege, one. of Davidson’s cousin col-
leges, is becoming tenuous. And the
circumstances are such that they could
well present themselves here.

It all began when a PhD candidate
from Emory, with a BA from Berke-

ley, MA from Tulane, a Phi Beta Kap-.

pa key and a Woodrow Wilson Fellow-
ship, applied for a teaching position
with Scott’s English Department. All
went well for a while, but her applica-
tion was abruptly halted when it was
revealed that the candidate, Mrs. Da-
vid Harris, was a Jew.

The incident opened the debate over
what is the proper role for a church-
related school in relation to the make-
up of its faculty. Scott’s trustees have
faced a great deal of opposition in
their 24-1 stand affirming that “it is
essential to sustain on the campus
conditions ‘distinctly favorable to the
faith and practice of the Christian re-
ligion’.” Atlanta papers and radio sta-
tions, as well as the New York Times,
have aired the story. Atlanta Mayor

Ivan Allen, a member of the board
who was absent when the vote was
taken, has said he is opposed to the
policy of discrimination.

The Emory Wheel has questioned
whether “Agnes Scott College is at-
tempting to be a liberal arts institu-
tion or a dogma-centered seminary.
We wonder if they completely deny
the weight of the Jewish role in the
shaping of our Judeo-Christian soci-
e Ld

The question is a vital one. Unfor-
tunately, it may not raise its head at
Davidson. Students have no voice in
who or what sort of faculty are chos-
en; they are not even informally con-
sulted by the dean of the faculty.
There is no way of knowing whether
“unacceptable” candidates are even
considered.

The trustee guideline that faculty
members will be of Christian commit-
ment will never even be challenged
under the present structure. Instead,
the college will continue to poke along

with its anachronistic, informal, per-
sonalized method of faculty selection.
And not a voice will be raised in dis-

sent.

THE WRONG WORD

Challenges Mistakenly Fools’ Names”

Labelled ‘Communism’

By ERWIN D. CANHAM
The Christian Science Monitor

We are often enslaved by
words. One such word is com-
munism. It has dominated
American thought, and much
other thought in the world, for
many decades.

The U.S.S.R. is the world’s
greatest Communist power.
But communism as_ imple-
mented by the Kosygin-Brezh-
nev team is very different
from communism as it was
carried out by Khrushchev, or
Stalin, or Lenin.

Since the Soviet Union
emerged from World War II,

it has thrust outward in many
directions. How much of this
aggressive drive stemmed
from communism, and how
much from the dynamic force
of the peoples federated under
Moscow's rule?

Impertal Russia, too. was
expanionist. The tight totali-
tarian rule brought by com-
munism made the thrust more
effective, especially as it was
joined with the world-revolu-
tion purposes and many effec-
tive techniques of communism.

But if the Russian Revolu-
tion had been won by moder-
ates instead of by Bolsheviks,

U. S. Presence To Cause

who is to say that Slavic ex-
pansionism would necessarily
have been less?

Perhaps the incentives and
efficiencies of a more dem-
ocratic regime might have
made Russian expansionism
all the greater.

Similarly, the awakening of
China under communism has
been formidable. Of course it
reflects the revolutionary pur-
poses and world aims of Marx-
ism.

But any effectively awak-
ened China, efficiently organ-
ized and ideologically aroused
—even if only by patriotic na-
tionalism—would have been a
portentous force.

It would not have accepted
willingly what it might well
interpret as hostile bases on
peninsulas and islands off its
mainland. Thus the behavior
of Peking, it seems reasonable
to conclude, is only partly con-
ditioned by the fanatical ver-
sion of communism that pre-
vails there.

Many Americans are con-
cerned by what they describe
as Communist threats inside
the United States.

But what many anti-Com-
munist Americans mean by
the term is the tendency to-
ward a welfare state, central-
ized power, governmental in-
terference in business, which
have steadily grown for much
of this century.

In short, many of us de-
scribe nearly everything we
don't like as communism. Thus
we seem to give communism
a far greater mass, power,
and influence than a correct
use of terms would justify.

Actually, communism—cor-

rectly defined—is in a state of
great flux in the world. The
U.S.S.R. makes steady con-
cessions to individual initia-
tive and some personal free-
dom.
The Eastern European states
tend to go even further. Chi-
nese communism is in a state
of civil war from which any-
thing can emerge.

But challenges which most
of us dislike and apprehend
are by no means weak. The
Soviet Union possesses for-
midable military power, which
it constantly seeks to aug-
ment.

Let us identify mankind's
enemies by exact and substan-
tive terms.

Destruction Of Vietnam

(ED. NOTE: The following
article, by Hugh B. Hester,
a@ retired Army Brigadier
General, expressed opposi-
tlen to the war in Vietnam
from a military man’s point
of view).

One of the most encourag-
ing and promising events on
the national scene is the re-
cent letter of protest to the
President about the Vietnam-
ese War by the student lead-
ers of 100 very important col-
leges and universities.

These leaders and their fol-
lowers in all schools through-
out the nation, whether in high
school, college or graduate
school, deserve, it seems to
me, the fullest possible sup-
port of people everywhere who
are for peace and justice.

T do not advise anyone to re-
fuse to serve when conscripted
for I cannot serve sentence
for him if and when he is con-
victed for refusing to serve.
But I can and do oppose mili-
tary conscription.

Military conscription encour-
ages unwise ventures by those
in power. For example, would
the United States be involved
militarily in Vietnam if peace-
time conscription were not in
effect? I doubt it.

‘There has never, in my opin-
fon, been a time when the peo-
ple of the United States would
not have rallied in overwhelm-
ing numbers to defend the na-
tion's vital interests, and I do
not believe there will ever
come a time when they will
not do so.

For this reason, I oppose all
types of compulsory govern-
ment service. Many new ones
are now being proposed in con-
nection with the review of the
present draft laws. The Unit-
ed States needs citizens, not
slaves. If the government will
make policies worthy of sup-
port, it will not need compul-
sory service of any kind.

The security of the people of

the United States is not an is-
sue in the Vietnamese war.
The Vietnamese could not at-
tack the United States, even
if they wished, because they
have no navy or air force ca-
pable of doing so, and will not
have such a force in the fore-
seeable future. Why then, are
our young men being con-
scripted to fight 10,000 miles
from home?

Former President Eisen-
hower, in substance, told the
Governor's Conference at Se-
attle, Washington, Aug 4, 1953.
that we were supporting the
French in their war against
the Indo-Chinese people be-
cause of our need for tin and
tungsten and other materials
from that area.

But is this adequate justifi-
cation for war? Cannot the
supplies required by the Unit-
ed States from Southeast Asia,
or any other area, be pro-
cured at a price fair to the
people in those areas?

It is vitally important, it
seems to me, that this fact be
brought to the attention of the
American people in order that
they may be encouraged to
use their sovereign right to
end the war.

It is equally important to
point out that this does not
constitute opposition to our
fighting men despite the mas-
sive propaganda to that ef-
fect. On the contrary, those
that oppose the war in my
opinion, are the only friends
the fighting forces have. How
else can the great slaughter
and destruction be stopped ex-
cept by ending the war?

Sgt. Donald Duncan, the
highly regarded Green Beret
who resigned after 19 years
in the army, 18 months of
which were spent in Vietnam,
put it this way: “Those people
protesting against the war in
Vietnam are not against our
boys in Vietnam. On the con-
trary they are against our
boys being in Vietnam.”

The Washington administra-
tion can secure a cease fire,
according to the National Lib-
eration Front leaders (Viet
Cong) and those in North Viet-
nam any day it chooses to ac-
cept the terms of the Geneva
Agreement of 1954.

if former President Etsen-
hower had kept his pledge not
to interfere with the implemeh-
tation of the Geneva Agree-
ment, Vietnam would have
been united by free elections
and under international su-
pervision in 1956. She would
also now be an independent
and neutral state.

If President Johnson would
accept the terms of the Ge-
neva Agreements, the war
would énd almost immediate-
ly. And this would in turn help
restore the prestige of the
United States, now so badly
damaged by the war.

The alternatives to the above
suggestion are grim indeed.
The first and most dangerous
is war with China. For a war
with China might very well
become World War III and
Journey's End for Man.

The second most dangerous
alternative, as well as an ig-
noble one, is the complete de-
struction of Vietnam and her
people. Unfortunately, this is
happening now.

Unless the American people
soon massively protest and
stop this war, they will be-
come responsible for the de-
struction of one of the oldest
cultures and societies of man.
All that would be left of this
once proud and independent
people would be the Quislings,
the prostitutes and miserable
refugees.

Should either of these world
tragedies occur, the people of
the United States would be de-
tested and hated by the vast
majority of mankind, as Sen-
ator Morse has repeatedly
charged, “for the next 500
years.””

Fools’ Faces

EDWARD DWELLE

Fact, Opinion, Reason And Emotion

THE ADMINISTRATION of Davidson College and
the administration of the government of the United
States are similar in many obvious ways and, presently,
especially in one particular way: Both of them attempt
both to hide true facts and intentions and to manipu-
late facts to conform to administration policy.

Since the federal administration is supposed to
operate in a democratic context, its policies are open to
inquiry and investigation by non-government groups;
and the freedom of this inquiry is guaranteed by the
Constitution. Now, as we all know, current investiga-
tion has shown the lack of success which the govern-
ment has had in hiding and manipulating facts, and
these investigations have produced the “credibility
gap” which is now evident in the United States.

6 e

BUT THE ADMINISTRATION of the college does
not operate in a. democratic context; it operates in an
authoritarian and totalitarian context and, thus, must
be expected to hide and manipulate true facts. It fol-
lows that if one comes to the college as a student, he
agrees in effect to accépt its totalitarian context and
not to question the authority of the administration or
the facts which it presents.

___ However, a problem arises when the administra-
tion represents itself as operating in a democratic con-
text rather than the actua totalitarian context in which
it operates, and the administration of the college does
present itself to the students as operating in a demo-
cratic context. Since this ‘is the case, the college ad-
ministration must be judged by the values of a demo-

cratic context.

___How does the college administration hide and ma-
nipulate the facts? It does this in several areas, one of
which is with regard to financial matters. It hides the
facts of income and expenditures as contained in the
Treasurer's Annual Report and the intentions of the
college regarding financial policy in general.

__ The Visiting Committee Report recognized this
hiding of facts when it said: “It was also the opinion of
the Committee, that a suggestion of secrecy, not pe-
culiar to the subject of finances alone, while perhaps
not intentional, pervades the academic atmosphere of

Davidson.”

Moreover, it manipulates facts in financial matters
by not using a system of cost accounting and by not
specifying how funds are transferred from endowment
accounts to operating accounts. One consequence of

this policy is

at it is presently impossible to contrib-
ute to the financial resources of th

e college without

contributing to all areas of the college program, includ-
ing those which you might not wists to support.

FACTS, HOWEVER, are of little or no value until
they are interpreted in a particular, existing situation
such as the Davidson College community, and the proc-
ess of interpretation is the process of forming an opin-
ion. Facts inform opinions, and opinions can differ
widely as long as they respect factual truth. Freedom
of opinion is a farce unles factual information is guar-

anteed and the facts themselves are not in

THE PROCESS of forming an opinion is the proc-
ess of considering a given issue from different La

points in order to make an impartial jud

the issue. The quality of the judgment, of an opinion,
depends upon the degree of its impartiality. Another
way of expressing this quality of impartiality is to say

that the quality o

ONE OF THE MANY ISSUES which we are cur-
rently considering at Davidson is that concerning the
place of subsidized athletics in the educational program
of the college. Notice that the issue must be decided
only in the context of the whole educational program
of the college. It cannot be considered objectively when

separated

rom the context in which

t occurs, the

whole educational program. To remove the issue from
its context is to render an impartial judgment impos-
sible; it is to lose the issue in a sea of subjective emo-

Several perfect examples of this emotionalism may
be readily seen in some of the “Letters to the Editor”
in last week’s DAVIDSONIAN. Thus Mr. H. L. Ruth is

disgusted,” and Messrs. Shuford Bumbarger, and
Bumbarger use invective phrases to appeal to the emo-
tions. And the senior football players cite the benefits
of the subsidized sports programs for them personally,
a fact which no one denies but which is not germane
to the issue viewed in the whole educational context.

But there is no way to form an impartial opinion
on this and many other issues at Davidson! Why? Be-
cause we do not have the facts upon which to form such
an opinion. The college administration has not seen fit
to release the facts. It has not seen fit to state, specif-
ically, what its policy regarding the educational pro-
gram as a whole is. We are unable to use the reason-
ing processes which are developed in a liberal arts edu-
cation because we do not have the facts with which to
make a judgment. Until we have these facts, we must
wallow in a sea of emtionalism and ignorance.

6 s

WHAT HAPPENS when the administration con-
tinues to hide and manipulate the facts? The answer is
quite obvious: A credibility gap is created which re-
sults in an extremely damaging loss of support for the
administration, an example of which may be seen in
our country today with regard to the federal govern-

ment. Signs of this loss of su

port for the college ad-

ministration are appearing at Davidson now. The wide-
ort of the administration would
