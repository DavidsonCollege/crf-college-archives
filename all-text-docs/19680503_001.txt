THEY'RE FOR REAL
Trustee W. C. Neill meets students.

Lingle Mingles As
Students. Question

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Managing Editor

Take five or 10 students.
add the chairman of the
Board of Trustees, give an
open door to student com-
ment~—and then observe.

The situation arose last
night when students got a
chance to talk to the trustees
in an informal session in the
lobby of Chambers Building.

Each student—except for a
quiet freshman—had his
angle. and tried to impress
it upon Walter L. Lingle Jr..
the trustees’ chairman.

One senior did not think the
new president should auto-
matically be’ a Presbyterian
and said so—in the same
sentence reworded at least
10 tines.

While. the senior repeatedly
asserted the Presbyterian-
only rule was illogical. Lin-
gle. arguing quietly and a
little defensiyely. made an
equally good case for the im-
practically of: changing the
rule until. clear cause arose.

He pointed out thationly 5
of the college's 14 presidents

were Davidson graduates in
reply to the. senior’s claim
that the restriction tended to
narrow the choice to David-
son alumni.

A sophomore senator asked
Lingle about the. effect of
publicity on the search. for
the president.

Tt could be harmful. Lingle
replied. but so far it, hasn't
been.

Lingle also made it clear
that he had no intention af
becoming Davidson's fifteenth
president.

As conversation moved to
the role of the student ad-
vistory committee, Lingle ad-
mitted that the new president
must have student support
but noticeably shrank back
from the word “veto” sug-
gested by a student.

Pressed about the role’ of
the student committee. Lingle

defended the lack of student-

representation on the official
trustee committee by citing
unfortunate experiences at
other colleges where the idea
had beeh tried. .
Students in those cases, ‘he
said, had broken confidences

Trustees Request Delay

For Complete Analysis

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Associate Editor

The Board of Trustees to:
day postponed action on the
report of the Commitiee on
Rules and Punishinents, with
the understanding that it will
be a topic of discussion -at
the next trustee meeting ‘‘in
the near future."

Walter L. Lingle Jr.. chair-
man of the board, said a ma-

or had been useless.

He expressed a strong fear
of premature judgment. and
seemed fairly certain that the
trustees could easily miss the
best choice for president.

When an SGA leader cited
fraternity rush as an example
of premature judgment, Lin-
gle quickly noted that he had
not pledged a fraternity until
his’ junior year, drawing the
only laugh of the hour-long
discussion.

Half of the group were In-
dependents.

The discussion broke up
when another trustee inter
rupted to offer apologies for
not replying to a letter, and
the students wandered off to
pin down other members of
the board, one muttering that
the refreshments had run out.

_— ee

jority of trustees “wanted
the chance to study the code
in light of the elucidation and
discussion at the meeting to
day.

“Unfortunately the final
version of the code was not
reduced. to paper until last
night,” he added, ‘‘so the
trustees were not yet ready
to make a final decision on
it.”

The report was presented to
them by the Trustee Student
Life Committee in the forme
that, was adopted by «the fac-
ulty Wednesday. Harllee
Branch. chairman of ‘this
committee. said the cormmit-
tee recommended the report
to the trustees.

The only changes made by
the faculty concern the desig-
nation of places for drinking
on campus and the require
ments for open dormitories.
They also detayed action on
the judiciary section until it
is examined by legal ad-
visers.

Lingle cited this as another
reason that ‘the trustees post-
poned action. “There was
some question about the
compatibility of this section
with the laws of the state af
North Carolina.” he said. He
did not cite ‘any particular
conflict but, said this was ‘‘a
generalization made by Har
llee Branch.”

He said discussion on the
CRAP report lasted about an
hour. President D. Grier

membet of the CRAP com
mittee, and three students
were present at the meeting
to answer questions about
the report.

The change in the section

of the Code of Responsibility

concerning alcoholic bever
ages states that drinking
“will be tolerated only in

areas specifically designated
by and under conditions pre
scribed by the. faculty, ad
ministration, and the student
senate.”

The change in the section
oh residence hal} life states
that *‘women visitors are per
mitted in the residence halls
only on college ’ conducted
tours. or under conditions and
at times which are mutually
agreed upon by the faculty,
administration. and the ap
propriate student organiza
tion."

A sentence was also added
to the Philosophy of Disci-
pline stating that ‘complaints
against non-student mem-
bers of the community are
the responsibility of the

president and the Board of.

Trustees."

Joe Murphy, student body
president and member of the
CRAP committee. said . he
was ‘‘not disappointed as
long as the report will be
considered at the next trus.
tee meeting and that meeting
will be before the end of

school.”

OPENING UP THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION

Most Non-Academic Wages
To Rise By 15 Cents In July

Non-academic wages were
raised in many jobs 15 cents
an hour by the trustees ef
fective July 1, said College
Treasurer Robert A. Currie
this afternoon.

Cafeteria employees, how-
ever, were not included, and
Currie said that ine admin-
istration was ‘“‘in the process
of reviewing their rates with
their management.”

“Except for special situa-
tions, as of July 1 we will be
at or above the $1.80 (feder-
al minimum wage) rate,’ ex-
plained Currie.

Federal law requires the
$1.60 wage only in industry at
present. The law applying to
the college specifies a mini-
mum of $1.15 per hour and 50
percent extra for hours over
42 per week.

In addition, the college has
set up job descriptions and
minimum and = maximum
rates for each position, elim-
inating a measure of the
bargaining for wages.

The college has been pay-
ing 50 percent overtime to
custodial-maintenance, laun-
dry and office employees
since last July. Medical ‘in-
surance with increased cov-
erage has been provided.

Figures on non-academic
wages are to be made avail-
able to fraternities, said Cur-
rie. as an aid in planning next
year’s budget.

The college has ‘‘a need to
meet area rates as quickly
as possible, and (we) ‘eel
that our proposals to the
trustees will be doing so,”
he said.

Special situations where the
wage will not technically
reach $1.60 per hour include
laundry employes. ‘‘who re-
main on the payroll dur’
the summer, receiving
days pay for one or two
work.”

This was done. because tne
college felt that it could not
completely drop employes for
the summer and employ them
only nine. months out of the
year, Currie said,

Currie expressed satisfac-
tion that Davidson had not
waited on its improvements
in non-academic salaries as
did Duke University.

Delays at Duke provoked
student protests in behalf of
the employees serious-
ly disrupting the university.
Duke was at the time paying
