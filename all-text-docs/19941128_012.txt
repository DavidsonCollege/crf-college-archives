THE DAVIDSONIAN
[

The Black Crowes return

By Tom Bavis

Controversial cover notwith-
standing, the Black Crowes’ new
album Amorica has substance be-
yond pubic hair. It is the Atlanta
band atits mostcreative, mostorigi-
nal, and most natural.

The album starts off confi-
dently with “Gone” and “A Con-
spiracy,” two of the album’s most
boisterous tracks. When the rever-
berative bass drum to “Gone” kicks
in, you could swear the laser of
your CD player almost jumped off
of its groove. Immediately it is
obvious that this album continues
the more mysterious and bizarre
statements of the band’s last al-
bum, 1992’s The Southern Har-
mony and Musical Companion.
Banished forever, the Crowes will
make you understand, are the de-
cent but by-the-numbers classic
rock tunes of Shake Your Money
Maker, their debut album.

As one of the most unap-

proachable songs of the album, “A
Conspiracy” makes for an odd
choice as the band’s first single.
Cut time signatures and wah-wah
guitars abound as singer Chris
Robinson menacingly begins,
“Well did you ever hear / the one
about last year? / it was all a lie.”
His sneer becomes a shout as the
music simultaneously drops its
wah-wahs in favor of a swirling,
psychadelic section that sets you
on edge. Then, at last, comes the
payoff: acatchy chorus that brings
the song back into the pop world.

“A Conspiracy,” though
maybe not Amorica’s best song,
exemplifies what makes this my
favorite Crowes album so far. It is
musically adventurous, with gui-
tarist Rich Robinson and company
taking many chances and coming
out ahead every time. The ar-
rangements fill the speakers with
sound, and even when it’s brash
and unsettling you would not want

to change a thing.

A steel guitar rests atop the
smooth groove of “Wiser Time,”
one of the finest songs of the CD.
Though a simple, three chord song,
“Wiser Time” draws you in with
Chris Robinson’s gorgeous
meloies and lyrics: ‘‘No time now
left for shame / horizon behind me,
no more pain.” .

“A Conspiracy,” “Wiser
Time,” and the rest of Amorica
makes for Chris Robinson’s finest
hour as well. Rather than hitting
and missing as he did on the first
two albums, he uses his voice in all
the right ways. He continues his
Janis-Joplin-meets-John-Lennon
style of wiggling his rough little
voice around a song; this time, he
does not tire you out. He even
dares, on “Wiser Time,” totry some
harmony vocals.

Lyrically, Chris Robinson still
has his embarassing moments —
for example, “I am a rounder / I

like toround around” from “Down-
town Money Waster’ — but shows
he is still trying. Among his finest
hours:ever comes at the end of
“Cursed Diamond”: “I hate my-
self/ Doesn’t everybody hate them-
selves / I scare myself / Then I tell
myself it’s all in my mind.” Fi-
nally, he speaks introspectively
without veiling the meaning in talk
about drugs, leather, or any of the
other trappings of a rock star.
Such is true about the ‘entire
album. The classic rock-memory

slowly fades as the true identity of
the Black Crowes emerges — that
of a quirky, moody group of men
that wears its 70s influences
proudly and feeds off the tensions
between each other. One of the
most consistent bands of the de-
cade, the Black Crowes prove with
Amorica that they are no mere one
hit wonder, the guys who did that
kickin’ version of “Hard to
Handle.” They have something to
prove. Hf it.takes a controversial
album covef to get people to pay
attention, so be it.
