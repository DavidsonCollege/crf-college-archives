Chance at State Honors

‘Hangs in Balance Friday

Wildcats Heavily Outweighed Face!

Crucial Test With Carolina Tech-
men at Pinehurst

Whether or not Davidson will remain in
the race for state championship honors will
be decided Friday at Pinehurst, in the game
with N. C. State. The game will be called
at 12 o'clock and is to be one of the features
of the Sandhill Fair.

Much interest in the game is being mani-
fested on all sides and the showing of the
light, Davidson team against thir heavier op-
ponents will be watched closely.

Outweighed on the line 22 pounds to the
man, the Davidson forward wall is being
given special coaching by Coach Tex all this
week. Each day hard scrimmage and signal
practice is held until late evening smoothing
out the rough spots and strengthening the
weak ones discovered in the Furman game.

The Techmen enter the contest having lost
four games and won one, Particular atten-
tion must be taken, however, of their severe
schedule this year. The record shows losses
to Penn State, N. Carolina University, S.
Carolina University, and V. M. I,
win from Trinity. State’s real strength can-
not be told by a perusal of the results.

Their true strength was displayed in the
V. M. I. game last week. While V.
ran up 17 points in the first two quarters,
State woke up and taking the ball on a grand
march down the field bucked it over for a
touchdown. In the last half the Techmen
played V. M. I. to a standstill, the score for
the final period being 0-0.

Davidson takes the field Friday with five
victories and one loss to their credit. Hav-
ing defeated Elon, P. C,, Richmond Univer-
sity, Wofford, and Lenoir, and having lost
to Furman by a small margin, the Wildcats
have a fine chance of annexing State's scalp.

The team is now unusually fit and trim.
With an eight-day rest and plenty of practice
and time for old injuries to heal, the Red
and Black? warriors should be able to play
one of the best games of their season.

Sappenfield, Covington, Hendrix, McComb,
Hunt and Black are clipping off long gains
through the line and around end, and on the
line Baker, Boggs, McConnell and Laird
seem to ‘be able to take care of anything
that comes their way. Captain Nappy Davis
is back in the game looking like a million
dollars, and he, Bohannon, Cox and Pink-
ney may be counted on for the wing  posi-
tions.

Another mountain of strength to the team
is the remarkable number of good reserves
which may be counted on in any emergency.

Rev, J. A. G. Moore, who was the first
Y. M. C. A. secretary that Davidson had
has just been appointed pastor of the
Cornell Student Church. This church
has 7,000 members and represents six
different denominations.

The Davidson scrubs went to Bingham
Military School seeking ‘revenge this
past week. They got it—13 too.

| The Kick-Off

By Don Wharton

This afternoon the Davidson squad left to
‘meet North Carolina State, a team that out-
weighs the Willdcats 22 pounds to the man
on the line and 10 pounds in the backfield.

Last Saturday the Techmen showed a
great comeback after the Flying Squadron
|had them 17-0. Taking the ball in their own
territory in the second quarter, Buck Shaw's
| men ploughed through the V. M. I. team for
a touchdown, and played the Virginians’ off
their fect in the second half.

Their record this year shows four defeats
and one victory—games lost to the best
teams in the South Atlantic and also Penn
State, and a 14-to-0 victory over Trinity.

Davidson, playing an entirely different
schedule, has come out with five victories
and one defeat. The game lost was to the
only Southern Conference team the Wildcats
have played.

The game that Davidson played cannot be
told by the score, Getting more first downs
‘and gaining more ground, Coach Younger’s
| outfit lost by a single blocked punt.

With Sappenfield back to direct the Da-
 Vidson attack and with Flake Laird again in
the line, the team will be considerably
' strengthened.

All hope has not gone! The Furman game
showed that Younger has some strong re-
|serves. Holding the powerful backs of Fur-
|man for four downs within the three-yard
‘line with several subs in the Davidson line,
i shows that along with the offense and line
linterference Coaches Tex and Monk have
| built a fighting line, a line that can be re-
lied upon at the critical moments.
| peshieersin|
Although two records were blasted Wed-
jnesday when Davidson was defeated and
| scored upon, do not forget that no team has
been able to run over or through or around
|the Davidson line for a touchdown.
| After months of obscurity, Popsy Hunt
| returned to his place among the galaxy of
| Davidson stars when he played the greatest
| defensive game of his life, and for three
ltimes slipped away from the Furman outfit
| for 25-yard gains.
| Not once did the officials have to penalize
| the Wildcats in Columbia.

| Not since October, 1916, has a Davidson
jeleven placed the Red and Black above the
| Red and White of N. C. State, and that was
,the only year that Monk Younger ever play-
‘ed for Davidson.

Coach Rawson's Yearlings looked like it
contained some great players last Friday.
| This afternoon's’ tilt with the little Blue
Devils will bring some state publicity to the
|squad, Efforts are being made to arrange
}a game with the State College first year men.

We couldn't go to press without a word of
praise for the greatest passing attack seen
jon Richardson Field—Jones, Clemson Fresh,
{running around left end and passing with
|his left arm and then around right with his
| right—perfectly timed; 75 yards in three
| plays.

| LOMBARD ENTERTAINERS

| (Continued from page 1)

lof the boy is taken by Mr. Lombard and that

igs the girl by Miss Fairchild. The scene
was full of jokes and witty sayings inter-

| spersed with songs and readings.

The entire program was of the highest
jtype and entertaining to the fullest extent.
| Judging from the way this program was re-
ceived by the audience the next performance
will have a Jarge attendance. The class of
entertainments being’ brought here by the
Junior class this year is of unusually high
calibre.

Mrs. J. R. Crayton had as week-end
guests her mother from Charlotte, and
a friend from Richmond.

|Undefeated Fresh Again
to Play on | Richardson

Firty Trinity Eleven to Invade
Davidson Territory Here
Friday Afternoon

| Spurred on by their victory over the fast
and hard-fighting Tiger Cubs and cager to
keep their slate clean, the Wildkittens are
hard at work in preparation for their battle
with the Trinity Freshmen here this Friday.

With a reputation of being fast and heavy.
jdnd led by Swift, former Greensboro star,
‘the Trinity outfit presents a dangerous ap-
pearance and it will take fight to down them.

Undiscouraged by their past record and an-

| xious to break the jinx which appears to be
hanging over them, the Trinity Fresh are
determined to take the Davidson team into
camp. Unusually hard luck seems to be the
measure of the future Blue Devils this year.
Their loss to Greensboro Hi was a victory so
far as first downs and ground gained are
concerned, but a recovered kick over Trin-
ity’s goal gave Greensboro the game 7-0.
Trinity also lost to the Wake Forest Fresh
13-6 and played Oak Ridge to a 0-0 tie. In
the first game of the season, however, they
beat Mars Hill 13-0,

The Davidson Freshmen are very enthusi-
astic over their showing in the past games
and are, working hard to go through the
season undefeated. At present their chances
look unusually bright, but they have a hard
grind ahead.

Although the Clemson tilt was a_hard-
fought game and one that taxed the team to
the utmost, there were few injuries and
with the exception of the usual stiff joints
and bruises the team is in very good shape.
Coach Rawson will start practically the
same team Friday that he used against Clem-
son last week.

The probable line-up will be:

PRAYER GROUPS RECEIVED
IMPETUS DURING THE
WEEK

The organized prayer groups among
the students are meeting regularly ev-
ery morning. Each dormitory has one
or more groups composed of about five
men each. A regular course of Bible
study is being carried on in several of
these meetings. There are about seven-
teen groups in all, meeting at about 7:40.
On Saturday morning a union meting
ischeld in Dr. Shewmake’s classroom oy-
er the armory.

There are about eighty “men actually
taking part in these meetings. When the
membership of group reach about ten,
they divide, forming two separate
circles.

The purpose of the groups is to pro-

mote the spirit of Christian life and fel-
lowship on the campus. They furnish a
bond between the members that is indeed
valuable, and it is to be hoped that they
will grow until they include every man
on the campus,
