Two Students Discuss War

By TOM BRUCE
Staff Writer

Resignation with the loss of
East Pakistan and faith in the
recovery of West Pakistan char-
acterize the reactions of Pakis-
tani exchange students a Ja-
hangir Tareen and Nadeem
Faizi.

In separate interviews the two
students repeatedly used the
same terms to describe what
they believed was the central
issue of the recent war. Both
believe that war was in India’s
interests, interests that dictated
the disinemberment of Pakis-
tan.

“The West Pakistan army was
sent into East Pakistan to sup-
press certain elements who be-
lieved in independence from
West Pakistan,” said  Faizi.
“This introduced a flow of re-
fugees into India, providing for
a good excuse to interfere with
Pakistan’s internal affairs.”

This idea was seconded by
Tareen who said “India has
Never reconciled herself to the
partition of the sub continent
and the secessionist movement
«1 Kast’ Pakistan provided it
with the excuse to attack and
realize its aim.”

A quasi faith in the survival
of the intant nation Bangladesh
was voiced by both students,
balancing their conviction with
the realization that it will be
an Indian satellite, ‘the poorest
nation in the world for a Jong
time te come.” in Faizi's words.

Tareen stated that the new
nation would survive under the
combined efforts of the Indians
and the Russians who “will
surely not let it collapse.”

Both students predicted that
Tedia will act promptly te in-
sure the new nation’s complete
dependence on it for military
and economie aid.

Faizi noted that jute from
Eust Bengal would d be sought by

India, while the rice of India
would be badly needed by the
Bengalis: ‘in that case the
Indians will keep their hold on
Bangladesh for a long time and
eventually dominate it entire-
ly.”

Tareen pointed out that India
has already transferred a num-
ber of its administrative offi-
cials to run Bangladesh.

Tareen's interest in the situa-
tion reached a high point when
he inquired into the possibility
of his returning home to join
in the war effort.

When asked why he felt this
obligation, Tareen replied, “The
reason is very simple. My coun-
try had been attacked and it
was fighting for its very life.
Sitting so far away ! felt help-
less and frustrated and felt that
1 needed to contribute some-
thing to the effort.”

Although Tareen had no criti-
cism of present United States

policy toward Pakistan, Faizi
said that the major flaw in
U. S. foreign policy is ‘‘its grac-
ious military aid to developing
countries.”

Under certain treaties Pakis-
tan receives aid from the Unit-
ed States: this aid takes shape
mostly in arms and weapons.

“This is exactly what we do
not neei—-we want only a docu-
mented assurance that Pakistan
is provided with adequate as-

sistance for its defense,” Faizi
said.
“Forcign aid to Pakistan

should be in fields of education
and research, agriculture, in-
dustries, and finally defense, in
that order.”

Faizi contended, however, that
American partiality toward
West Pakistan prevented what
might have developed ‘‘into a
world crisis.” Faizi hastens to
add, “‘This is not a conceited
viewpoint.”
