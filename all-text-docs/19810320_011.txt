_ that ‘‘right now the situation has
problems.’’ She feels that it hurts
someone more to self-select into a
fraternity without an oral encourage-
ment and be ostracized than to seek a bid
and be rejected.

According to KA President Eric

Crum, ‘‘because the present system.

can’t be policed and can’t be enforced,
it’s inconsistent throughout the court.”’
Wade’s tentative proposal provides
that:
a) Fraternities and other houses
should be allowed to issue bids in late

January with a few days for freshmen to

respond.

‘-b)An:-Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
officer should moniter the rush period
with the authority to sanction violators.

c) Self-selection should be preserved
for those houses not wishing to partici-
pate in a bid system, thus allowing
houses to reach quotas.

d) The PCC should make sure thé
houses fully understand the financial
responsibility involved in a full house.

e) The PCC should work toward
incorporating the Sig Eps and the Fijis
into the system.

Wade feels ‘‘the two-tier system would
work 100 percent better than self-selec-
tion. It brings everything in the open
more honestly.’’ He added that the new
system would cause less hurt and
disappointment than self-selection be-
cause ‘‘the atmosphere that houses
present to freshmen at first would be
more friendly.’’

aspects of players’ games.”” He
said, ‘‘We must roll up our
sleeves. I'll work as hard as I
can.”’

Kresse’s immediate plans in-
volve recruiting for next sea-
son’s team. He is not worried
that Davidson’s strong academ-
ic program interferes with ath-
letics or discourages prospects.
He said he will emphasize ~
Davidson’s tradition of turning
out graduates successful in the
business world.

-This: week Kresse is concen-
trating.on meeting and getting
to know the players. He does
not anticipate any personal
conflicts with the team. He
said, ‘‘I demand discipline, but
the pat-on-the-back will always

be there in a very professional
sense. I’m also not going to be a
bull in a china closet. I’ve had
very fine player-coach relation-
ships in the past.”

Kresse said that Biedenbach
has been quite gracious and has
helped me with information
about players and program and
has also handed over much
recruiting material.’’

Kresse began playing basket-
ball at St. John’s College under
the legendary Joe Lapchick,one
of the original Celtics.

Soon afterwards, he took a
job coaching basketball and
baseball at a high school in
Queens, New York. In 1965,
when he was 21,

The current systme assigns freshmen
to eating houses by running their
selections through a computer in random
order. Freshmen may either name their
first three choices or ‘‘shot-gun”’ a single
house.

Freshmen must fulfill certain interest
requirements in order to self-select an
eating house. Interest requirements
include meeting at least one house
officer, attending five social functions,
and eating three meals at the house.

encouragement is really a thinly dis-
guised bid,’’ he commented.

- Phi Delt President Mike Iordanou said
“the system is working fine for us. . .We
haven’t had any trouble like the other
houses.’’ He said all those who desired to
become Phi Delts received oral encou-
ragement.

However, because he feels problems
might arise in the future, Iordanou
‘“‘wouldn’t mind seeing’’ the former
fraternity system reinstated. ‘‘I would
vote against self-selection,”’ he said.

Although the present system is ‘‘kind
of an inconvenience,’’ SAE President
Burton Vance feels self-selection ‘‘works
pretty well.’’ He believes the system is
good for Davidson because of the

College’s size.

Former SAE President Blaine Sanders
feels the self-selection process ‘‘is super
for the eating houses,”’ but for the court
in general, the term self-selection is a
“misnomer,”’ he said. Self-selection is
“hypocritical if you think about it.”’

Both Vance and Sanders support the
two-tiered system. Sanders believes the
proposed system wold be the most
forthright although there may be ‘‘logi-
stical problems” involved.

On the other hand, self-selection

problems in the way the system is
functioning now, but ideally I believe the
system can work.’’

Wilson thinks that the freshmen do
not get down to the houses enough, and
that oral discouragements, while theore-
tically illegal, do in fact occur.

Wilson, former president of Emanon,
believes the addition of interest require-

ments has helped the self-selection -

process. As a result of these expecta-
tions, he said, ‘‘freshmen have become
more aware of their responsibility of
going down to the houses and meeting
the members.”

He added, ‘‘The more we can encou-
rage freshmen to visit above and beyond
the interest expectations, the better the
system yill work.”

Crum feels that the College should
either enforce the self-selection system
or adopt the two-tiered systme. Stock-
ton addded, ‘‘I am sure if there was a
student-wide referendum on whether or
not to keep self-selection, all the

fraternities would be in favor of a
two-tiered system.”

According to Dean Terry, ‘If there is
a need to renovate, the way will not be
referendum. . .We should investigate
and study it and make recommendations
if warranted.” Sophomore PiKA Ken
Krieg said, ‘‘What is needed at the
moment is for the PCC to ask the
Trustees to initiate a study of the
efficacy of the present self-selection
system.”’

German Professor Hansford Epes,
who was active in reforming the social
system at Davidson in the early ’70’s,:
said ‘‘I really wonder if students who
want to go to a two-tier system realize -
how great the danger is that there will be
an upper and lower tier. Do we really
need a potentially divisive class struc-
ture on a campus as small as this one?”’

College President Samuel Spencer
first outlined the present system in a
September 1970 speech. In the speech he
said, ‘‘A new system would put all
students on an equal basis with regard to
the cost of meals and social functions. It
would foster closer contact between
faculty and students on an informal
level. It would eliminate rush week, one
of the most disruptive and wasteful
procedures of the college year.”

The present social system was de-
signed to alleviate fraternity problems of
the late 1960’s. Fraternities have existed
at Davidson since 1858.

New computer

(Continued from page 1)
Psychology Professor John Brockway, a
member of the ad hoc committee on instructional
use of the computer, said the new computer “will
give Davidson students,a competitive edge. It

provides a different way to look at liberal arts
education.”

The Prime 750 and 550 are ‘‘an economical
choice—a wise use of funds,”’
He expressed hope that with the new computer
system, Davidson students will develop ‘‘com-
puter literacy.’’ Epes said students “should have
some conception of how computers work and
what they are—and are not—good for.’’

Student members of the committee Mark
Phillips and Mark Thomas also approved of the
purchase. The present computer is ‘‘pretty poor,”’
Thomas said, ‘‘It’s horrible,’’ Phillips exclaimed,
“Tt can’t write a program more sophisticated than
Math 23; it doesn’t print fast enough; and the
editor function is just the worst I’ve ever seen.”

The Prime750 features computer assisted
instruction function, in which the computer acts
as an electronic tutor. This will be especially
valuable in language drills, Desieno said.
