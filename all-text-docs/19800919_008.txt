Veterans bolster hockey

By ANNE HOCKETT
Staff Writer -
Field hockey is-a team sport
and for all involved it means a

serious committment both of |

time and energy. The game
requires stamina, speed, flexi-

and re-adjust spontaneously.

Hockey as a women's sport is
relatively new to the Davidson
campus, yet the team’s opti-
mism, enthusiasm and overall
sucess rank with any other
school in the Carolina’s.

Sixteen players returned for —

pre-sesson camp—an extensive
week of conditioning and stick
work. Since then the addition of
three more players has pushed
the number to 19, making this
year’s team the largest ever.

Returning seniors Barb Ash-
ley, Lisa Ballantyne, Sally
Craig, and Cathy Inabnet are
expected to be an integral part
of the 1980 team. Carol Hepp-
ner, last year’s Deep South
pick, returns with fellow soph-
omores Amy Crittenberger,
Beth Davidson, and Cathy
Morrel. °

The addition of two new
sophomores, Mebane Atwood
and Mitzi Short, is expected to
help the team defensively. Katie
Dagerhart and Courtney Hall,
Deep South picks for their high
schools, bring the total number

of freshman players to eight.
The nineteenth player is Wendy
Rider, a senior transfer.

Coach Mayes, a 1978 gradu-'

ate from Ithaca College and an

one, but Davidson looks for-

ward to a good showing in the

State tournaments and hopeful-
ly a chance to compete in
Regionals.

Coach Mayes emphasized,
“the team is strong.” Offen-
sively, three veteran line play-
ers, two experienced links, and
the support of veteran Amy
Crittenberger at center half are
expected to unify play around
the goal.

The first scrimmage is Thurs-
day at 4:00. The first home-
game is October 1.

‘Men win, women lose at Stone Mt.

By GORDON TRUMBULL
Staff Correspondent

Cross-country coach Sterling
Martin said he looks toward the
1980 season with cautious opt-
imism.

The Wildcat Men’s and
women’s squads opened their
schedules this past weekend in
dual meets at the Stone Mount-
ain (Georgia) Road Race.

The men’s team shut out the
University of Tennessee at
Chattanooga (15-50) and beat
Berry College (23-35). The wo-
men’s team dropped their meets
against Berry College (34-23)
and a strong Georgia State
squad (40-15).

Martin said that he was very
pleased with the team’s per-
formances. He commented,
“Since this was a test meet to
see where everyone is in his
individual training, we were
rather pleased.’’ Martin added
that there is as much depth in
the program this year as in any
previous year.

The addition of junior Randy
McManus, a transfer from a
strong program at Buford
Junior College, greatly streng-
thens the men’s team.

McManus along with senior
John Davis will hold down the
' top two slots on the squad.
Martin stressed the value of
_ these two: men, “This year we
have two runners who can go
out and take the top spot in a
race. In past years, we've
lacked the person who could
win,”

Sophomore Jack Smith and
senior Bart Landess will vie for

the next two positions, while
juniors John Rees and Danny

Armistead battle to complete

the top five. The Wildcats gain .

valuable depth in the next four
places with sophomores Dave
Stosur and Joe Sloop, and
freshmen Franklin Ivey and
Jim Trotter. Trotter won the
1980 Freshmen Cake Race.

Freshmen Cake Race winner
Tamara Foreman, who broke
the previous record by 39
seconds, will lead the women’s
team. Sophomore Marian Hill,
much improved after a summer
of hard work, should keep the
second slot, followed by junior
Carrie Nunn, sophomore Merris
Hollingsworth, and freshman
Jane Thompson.

Natalie Kerr, a sophomore, in
her first season of cross-count-
ry, and Diane Downing, a
junior overcoming knee prob-
lems, can be counted on to
improve throughout the season.

Martin cited specific goals for
the men’s team in the coming
season. ‘‘We hope that each
individual] will improve. I’d like
to see our top five have 10,000-
meter times of between 31 and
33 minutes. If we could do that,
we might surprise some peop-
le.”

Martin hopes his men will
finish above .500 in the South-
ern Conference, but said ‘It will
take tough running. Probably
every other team in the corifer-
ence except UT-C is scholarship
supported. But I would like to
finish fifth in the conference or
better.” ,

Randy McManus led the
men’s squad at Stone Mountain
with a 5-mile time of 25:45. He
was followed by John Davis

(25:57), Jack Smith (26:43),

Bart Landess (26:53), John

oa

Rees (27:14), and Danny Armi-
stead (27:14). Tamara Fore-
man’s time of 33:19 led the
Wildcat women, with Marian
Hill (34:13), Carrie Nunn (34:
42), Merris Hollinsworth (37:
02), and Jane Thompson (38;14)
completing the scoring.

This Saturday the cross-
country team takes on a power-
ful Duke team in a dual meet at
Davidson. The women rage at
10 a.m., followed by the men at
11 a.m.

Soccer starts on right foot

By TOM PAFFORD
Staff Writer
The Grateful Dead, those
seemingly prophetic purveyors
of wisdom, offer a terse phrase
about fate,
They lie where they fall
There's nothing more to say.
New soccer coach Charlie
Slagle seems to think somewhat
parailel to this, although just as
the Grateful Dead surrounds
the phrase with sanguine amens

for a fortunate outcome, Slagle |

inherits a Davidson soccer team
with the potential to recover
from the sluggish 8-13 record of
last year.

The Wildcats opened their
season with back-to-back shut-
out wins over Presbyterian, 3-0,
and last Saturday’s 5-0 defeat
of Catawba. The team domi-
nated each contest, outshooting
their opponents 80-9 in at-
tempts at the goal, but Slagle
was not ecstatic. Speaking of
Presbyterian, he said, ‘‘It was
not a good first game.” ‘‘We
didn’t execute well near the
goal. But we won 3-0 and we’ll
take it.”’

A bright spot for the Cats
against Catawba was the play
of freshman Chris Roberts from
upstate New York, who gar-
nered three goals.

‘‘Our whole philosophy is
depth,’’ Slagle stated. ‘‘We’ll
use 18 to 22 players each game,
trying to use depth to our
advantage. We lost four guys
from last year’s team, but I
have a good nucleus to work
with.”

Slagle noted the leadership of
his three captains— Mike Ior-
danou, a junior goalie, Danny
Robinson, another junior play-
ing sweeper, and senior Chris
Moore at wing fullback.

Notable returnees include
Ben Dishman and Mark El-
more, plus a defensive unit. of
Jimmy Hawk, Bill Wahl, and
Alex McCauley of whom Slagle
said, ‘could run all day.“
Coming off the bench will be
last year’s two top scorers, Tom

Schember and Hall Barnett. :

Freshman support could come

from a number of players,
including Roberts, and Peter
Burr.

Thus far in the young season,
injuries have not been a major |
concern in the soccer program
and conditioning seems to be on
schedule. Coach Slagle said that
he is ‘‘not a believer in being in
peak condition for the first
game.” He prefers to delay the
peak until mid-season in hopes
of better-surviving the grueling
9-week schedule.

- Taking over the reigns from
Karl Kremser, last year’s coach
who was ousted for reasons
including ‘‘personality con-
flicts,’’ could easily pose prob-
lems.of reorganizing team strat-
egy and lineups. Slagle doesn’t
feel that any major problems
exist, noting only that he feels
he has ‘‘a lot looser personali-
ty.” ;

‘The main difference is at
practice. But the general phi-
losophy is the same. We’re still
playing man-to-man defense. I
have coached it before, so it’s
easier for me to adapt to the
system than to change the way
they are used to playing.”

Slagle hesitated somewhat at
predicting a record for the year
other than ‘“‘hopefully win-
ning.’’ With regard to the
Southern Conference, however,
he was willing to be more
definite. Realistically, Slagle
believes the Cats are ‘‘striving
for second, hopefully first.’’
Appalachian State has held the
top spot in the conference for
several years, and although he
would ‘‘love to beat:Appy,”’
Davidson’s best chances lie
with turning around narrow
defeats to other opponents.

_ “Our goal is to beat the teams
we lost to-by a goal last year,
the Citadels and the VMI’s,”
Coach Slagle emphasized. He is
a believer that Davidson can get
the wins it is capable of, and
hopes that things could fall into
place against Appalachian.

If some good omens bear
fruit, the season could fall in
such a way that “winning” is all
that needs to be said.
