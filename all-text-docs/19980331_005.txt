To ALL 21 YEAR OLbs:

This year’s Spring Frolics will be a BYO BEER event. Below are the guidelines that you MUST follow in order to bring beer to Spring Frolics:
1. Each person is allowed to bring 9 beers maximum inside the gates of Richardson Field during the event.
.2. You may only enter once with beer — so if you bring 6, that is how many you will have at the event. No glass allowed! Cans only!

3. You should bring your beer in your own cooler with your name printed on it. We will have ice at the field if you need it. There will be a few coolers
that will be available on a first come first serve basis.

4. Upon entrance to the field you will take your beer to the designated serving area. At the area you may receive one beer at a time (We will provide cups.
You MUST use our cups.). If you would like to share your beer with other 21 year olds, this MUST be done in the serving area.

Some other notes about the event:

1. You will be able to come and go as you please. However, if you leave with your cooler, you will not be permitted to enter again with your beer.

2. 21 year olds will be identified with a wristband which you will receive upon entrance to the field.

3. Your name will be written on your wristband at the entrance gate and only you will be able to receive your beer. This is intended to keep your beer
from mysteriously “disappearing.”

All of the rules follow the Davidson College BYO policy guidelines. Please comply with the rules so that we can all enjoy ourselves on the 3rd.

Thank You,

Thirza Sayers
