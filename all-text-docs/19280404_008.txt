Dr. Logan Holds Series
of issionary Lectures

Interesting Talks Made to Students
in ooms

Dr. Charles A. Logan concluded the Mis-
sion Institute, which began at “Y” vespers
Sunday night, with a speech on the subject
of missions, at an open meeting last night.

Dr. Logan is a missionary on a furlough
from Japan and he is at present engaged in
lecturing on missions at Columbia Seminary.
He is also teaching Bible at Agnes Scott
College.

According to Jim Appleby, secretary of
the Y. M.'C. A. here, the students and peo-
ple of Davidson were fortunate, indeed, in
having the opportunity to hear a man of such
renown and ability as Dr. Logan. The lead-
ers of the Y. M. C. A. say that the institute
conducted by him was a complete success
from every point of view, due.in great part
to Dr. Logan’s charming personality and
ability as a lecturer combined with his first-
hand knowledge of the subject.

During his stay in Davidson, Dr. Logan
spoke on practically all the different aspects
of missions and the duties of a missionary,
including the various fields, purposes, etc., of
the missionary. He opened the Mission In-
stitute with a talk on missions and Chris-
tianity in the Orient Sunday night at “Y”
vespers. He spoke again Monday morning
at chapel and, after conducting a number of
classes Monday and Tuesday, he concluded
the Mission Institute with an extremely in-
teresting speech in Shearer ,Hall Tuesday
night. Those who attended his classes during
Monday and Tuesday report that they were
very interesting and of much benefit to those
intending to become missionaries.

The

Prominent Surgeon

Talks sto Students

Speaking to a group of students who are
interested in surgery as a profession, Dr. Ad-
dison Brenizer, of Charlotte, on Friday night
concluded the Vocational Guidance talks
which have been sponsored by the Y. M. C.
A. Dr. Brenizer was introduced by Dr. J.
W. MacConnell as one of the leading prac-
ticing surgeons of North Carolina. He is a
graduate of Davidson College and John Hop-
kins Medical University and has taken post-
graduate work at Heidelberg. Aside from
the distinction in his profession. Dr. Brenizer
is a man of influence known throughout the
state.
“Surgéry,” he said, “is a progressive pro-
fession. It has great variety. The styles of
operations change as frequently as women’s
dresses.”
Then dwelling upon surgical ethics, Dr.
Brenizer discussed the attitude which a surg-
eon should take toward his chosen work. In
addition to being a good surgeon, a man as-
piring to that profession should be a good
diagnostician, A man who holds the lives of
others in his hands is under a great deal of !
responsibility and is therefore obligated to
thoroughly prepare himself. He must know
what he is about.
A man should not go into surgery for
money alone but he owes it to his family to}
provide for his wife and children. |
To be a surgeon, a man must have an at-
tractive personality that will inspire the con-
fidence and respect of those with whom he
works. A surgeon should never lose a pa-
tient by hurting his feelings.

Dr. Brenizer closed his talk by an open
forum discussion and: answered such ques-
tions as were asked him by the students.
