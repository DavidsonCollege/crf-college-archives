A 2-1 victory over The Citadel
last Saturday gives the soccer
team a good chance of winning
their division in the Southern
Conference.

Coach Harry Fogleman was
very pleased with the team’s
performance.

“We played an exceptionally
good game." he said.

Fogleman added that David-
son was in control throughout
the entire. game.

Davidson's dominance of the
game was not reflected in the
score. The Cats had 25 shots on
goal while holding The Citadel
to7.

Fogleman praised both the of-
fense and the defense.

His overall appraisal was
that. ‘‘We had to play our very
best, and we played as well as
we ever have.”

Davidson now stands 2-1 in

Pfeil Adjusts To School, Soccer

By FORD NEWMAN
Staff Writer

International Exchange
student Reinhard Pfeil has had
to make many transitions while
at Davidson not only in athletics
but academically and socially
as well.

Speaking on the style of the
soccer played here as coin-
pared to the German style Pfeil
said, ‘‘The guys over here are in
really good shape, but they
don't have the skills of the
players in Germany."

Pfeil added that in Germany
they would usually have only
one or two two-hour practices a
week devoted mainly to skill
and individual technique as
compared to the two-hour prac-
tices every day at Davidson.

Another difference noted by
Pfeil was the amount of contact.
“It is a lot rougher here than

in Germany but this depends on
the experience of the players,”
said Pfeil who suffered a
“charley horse” in the High
Point game. The injury oc-
curred when the High Point
goalie kicked Pfeil in the thigh.

“I have never been injured
this badly before.” said Pfeil

Commenting on the Davidson
team as a whole. Pfeil said that
three or four players play well
together but the team needs to
play more together and have
everyone in the game

But Pteil felt this was due to
inexperience noting that in Ger
many the soccer season lasts al!
year except for a few months in
the summer when its too hot to
play. He said that soccer games
plaved in the snow were not un
common

Pteil believes that the
popularity of soccer may be on
the upswing.

“Soccer is a very young sport

here.” said Pfeil. “It could have

a future.”

When asked to evaluate his
own past performances Pteil
said that they could have bee:
better

But he added, *‘I hope my per-
formance will be better, maybe
in the playoffs."

Pfeil's problems
academically are not unlike
those of most Davidson students.
He indicated that it was hard
for him to complete his studying
with all the reading it entails.

Pfeil whose native school of
Marburg has an enrollment of
around 12,000 men and women
has had to adjust to the small
college atmosphere of David-
son.

“The weekends are very
boring without dates and I miss
the dancing clubs,” said Pfeil.
“But the cultural programs

When asked to evaluate
Davidson over-all Pfeil laughed
and said, ‘You can spend your
time very usefully here at
Davidson."

But on a more serious note he
added that the people here have
been more than friendly and
that he has gotten all the help
he has needed from both

have any more conference

schedule.

could go to any one of five
teams. Davidson's final stand

ing will be determined in the
remaining games played be

members

A round-robin playoff in the

event of a tie is a definite
possibility.
On Tuesday the team

traveled to St. Andrews and
returned with a 4-1 victory.

Before the game Fogleman
had been apprehensive, fearing
that injuries would hurt the
team.

All but two starters played
however, in what goalie Charlie
Slagle felt was the team’s finest
game to date.

“We're starting to play as a
team and finally putting
everything together." he said.

Davidson took a 2-0 lead in the
first half with the first goal
coming on a penalty kick by
Tatum. Rheinhard Pfeil scored
the second goal.

Tatum and Pfeil also scored
the second and third goals in the
second half. The St. Andrews
goal came on a corner. kick
which was headed into the goal.

The team played together
well the entire game, according
to Fogleman. The only lapse
came early in the first half
when St. Andrews tested Slagle
with a hard shot.

The team's homecoming op-
ponent will be Belmont Abbey.
The game will be played on
Saturday.
