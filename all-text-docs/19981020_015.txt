The Wildcats’ 1-0 victory over
Southern Conference Rival Furman
University was Davidson’ s biggest win
of the season thus far. The ‘Cats stunned
the 12th ranked Paladins on their home
field on October 7th.

The match was definitely an ex-
ample of a game in which statistics did
not tell the entire story. Furman outshot
Davidson 22 to 10 and 5 more corner
kicks; however, Davidson, unlike
Furman, was able to put the ball in the
net.

With just over 14 minutes remain-
ing in the contest junior Andrew
Holbrook scored on a assist from fresh-
man Paul Watson. The goal was
Holbrook’s fifth of the season. The

_ Letter to the Editor —
Davidson needs a Pep Band

Last year was the first year in a long while that The Davidson Wildcats had
the sounds of live brassy music backing them up against visiting teams. This
year the Wildcat Pep Band will return with an even louder, brassier sound to
pump up the crowd and make the courts of Baker ring! ©

Being in the stands during a home game is always a thrilling experience
but does not compare to blaring out the Davidson fight song after a score has
been made. I had the chance to play the sousaphone in the inaugural pep band
last fall and enjoyed every minute of it. There were many perks in addition to

they didn’t waste any
time doing just that. Just 48 seconds
into the game Senior Fred Ryser scored
his first goal of the season and the first

of his Wildcat career. After that, the
game was never in doubt. The Wildcats
dominated, out-shooting their oppo-
nents 21 to 1. Also scoring for Davidson
were sophomores Ikenna Myers and
David Buehler (Buehler leads the ‘Cats
with 5 goals and 32 shots this season).
Junior Andrew Holbrook scored
Davidson’s fourth goal of the game
unassisted.

Most recently, on October 16th,
Davidson conquered yet another South-
ern Conference foe when they narrowly
defeated Wofford (1-13-1, 0-4) 2 to 1.

The game was extremely close and
hard fought. Davidson led for the ma-
jority of the match due to a goal by

* Andrew Holbrook at the 20:18 mark of
the first half. Holbrook scored the goal
after Davidson keeper, senior Brad

retrieved it and powered it passed the
Wofford keeper.

Neither team was able to score for
the remainder of the first period, but
halfway through the second period
Wofford’s Nate King tied the game
with a shot from inside the box.

Just when it appeared as if
Davidson might have to settle for a
disappointing tie, Holbrook came to the
rescue. With less than four minutes
remaining Holbrook scored his second
goal of the game, and fifth of the season,
of an assist from fellow senior Fred
Ryser. Davidson emerged with an ex-
citing 2 to 1 victory. :

The Wildcats currently stand at 4
and 13 overall and 3 and 3 in the Con-
ference. Their next game isa key South-
ern Conference match-up at Appala-
chian St. this Wednesday at.7:30.

With the Southern Conference
meet only two weeks away, the
women’s cross country team knew
the North Carolina State meet this
weekend would not only prove vital
in their preparation for this impor-
tant day, but would also be a big
indication as to where the stood go-
ing into the conference meet. With
this knowledge as their motivation,
the women walked away with a
strong score and have high expecta-
tions for the upcoming meet at
Davidson. A total of sixteen teams
entered the race, including Southern
Conference powerhouse Appala-
chian State, who dominated the meet.
The Wildcats finished with a re-
spectable seventh place and a team
score of 170 points, leaving nine
teams in their dust.

25 seconds of one another. Coach Tho-
mas Cason comments on this achieve-
ment, “Our goal this week was to run
more team oriented by packing in our
runners Close to each other,” he said.
“This is how we’ re going to beat a lot of
teams whose runners are more spread
out as they cross the finish line.”

Leading the top five were sopho-
more Smyth Bitter and senior Suzy
Burr, who claimed the 21st and 29th
overall places respectively. Side by side,
Clare Frey and Caroline Little worked
together to grab the third and fourth
team spots. Frey, who improved her
time by seven seconds, ran the PR (per-
sonal record) of her cross-country ca-
reer. Freshman Lucy Billingsley, the
team’s fifth finisher, showed a nice
improvement by running her exact time
from the previous Lehigh meet on this
week’s more difficult course.

Sorely missed this weekend was
sophomore Jill Neumayer, who nor-
mally contributes to the top five but was
unable tocompete due to illness. Round-
ing out the top seven were seniors Kelly

Rhiannon Ollis and Julia

showing the essential contribution
of this year’s freshman. The Lady

Lannon, Ellen Runnels, Becca Wil-
son, Tab Combs, and Kathleen
Shields, all improved their race times
significantly from last weekend’s
meet at Furman. Both Lannon and
Shields, who have suffered disap-

frustrations behind by bettering their
times by over a minute.

For the next two weeks, the
women’s team will have their sights
set on the Southern Conference Invi-
tational. The conference meet is
being held at Davidson on the morn-
ing of October 31st.
