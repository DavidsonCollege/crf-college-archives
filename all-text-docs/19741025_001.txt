The 1973-74 edition of Quips and
Cranks was not distributed last Thur-
sday because of what has come to
be called ‘an act of censorship. While
misconceptions and misin-
terpretations seem to be the rule
when the yearbook is discussed, one
thing is generally agreed upon: the
president’s office has censored the
book.

Yearbook Editor Jeff George had
scheduled the distribution of the an-
nual tor Thursday, Oct. 17. The
books were to be delivered late Wed-
nesday. George claims the book was
‘all ready to go’’ right up to Tuesday

of any problem.

member of the yearbook publishing
company called College Business
Manager. Robert A. Currie. He
inquired of Currie Davidson’s
desires about printing George’s
yearbook.

“Nobody questioned me,’’ George
said. ‘‘I had no idea that there was
any problem whatsoever.” (It was
explained to Currie that the book con-
tained ‘‘questionable’’ material.
Currie was to be in Charlotte on
business Wednesday anyway, and it
was decided that he would pick up a
copy of the parts in question before a
decision was made on the book’s
printing.

tacted Currie. Under Davidson’s

organizations, all activities’ money
is collected by the college through the
. activities fee in the comprehensive
fee payment.

Once the money is collected (ac-

tually in the spring before the collec-
tion) the campus tax council meets to
appropriate, the activities money.
Beginning July 1, officers of the
various organizations are authorized
to spend the allocations.
. In order to receive the funds ap-
propriated, each organization must
submit vouchers or bills to the
college comptroller’s office. Checks
are issued twice weekly, signed by
Business Manager Currie.

This system by which Currie has to
sign all checks, led George to bring
him in as a co-signer on the contract.

Currie was called by the publisher.

by campus tax get both activities and

On Thursday, George called the
publishing company to find out where
the books were. At this time the
publisher informed him of the

Thursdas afternoon student
inquirers were told by Dean Terry’s
office that the books were not in.
Terry’s secretary (accurately ac-
cording to Terry) disclaimed any
knowledge cf the book’s whereabouts
and sent questioning students to
Currie’s office. Terry himself saw a
copy of the pages and knew’ of the
decision by at the latest Thursday
morning.

Anumber of students have claimed
that they were deliberately misled by
the déean’s office. While Terry denies
this, George claims he was told by
the dean that Terry was purposefully
not giving students the information
on the books’ situation.

By Friday, it was becoming fairly
well known on campus that the books

were under some form of censorship. -
_ Being censored were two frontal pic-

tures of male “streakers’’ and two
captions; one quoting the lead line of
a DAVIDSONIAN editorial, the other
using a four letter word for
copulation.

On Friday noon, George and SGA
President Blain Butner met with
Spencer. They were told that the cen-
sorship was his decision and that the
“questionable material’’ could not be
used in the book.

‘We discussed and offered com-

promise,’ Butner and George .-
agreed, ‘“‘but the president indicated
that he would not compromise. He in

formed us that we could appeal his.

representatives of campus

It was at this meeting that the let-

SGA resolution and the campus-wide

petitions were discussed and-set in

up publicizing the issue.

On Monday, Spencer received a let-
ter from George explaining his desire
to appeal the decision to the trustees.

At a luncheon meeting with represen- °

tative students Spencer explained

trustee Student Life Committee.

“After the appeal to the trustees,
we are hopeful that our yearbook will
be delivered in an uncensored form,”’
said WDAV News Director Scott
Reid. “‘If not, we will gotocourt.”

Numerous nafional student
organization representatives have
been contacted, according to Butner,
and all are interested in helping. ‘‘It:
seems as though a lot of-peopJe are
concerned over a private college’s
claim to censorship powers,”’ he said.

The Charlotte law firms of Blum
and Sheely and George Daly have
also been contacted. If the appeal to
the trustees fails, students say they
are prepared to go to the Charlotte
newspapers and to court.

An attorney contacted unofficially,
by one student representative claims
that the case is clearly in favor of the
students in any merit charges of ob-
scenity. He sees only a jurisdictional
question, though he points out that
the state constitution clearly states

_that ‘‘there can be no interference

with freedom of the press.” _ :
