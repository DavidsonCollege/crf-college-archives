WHEREVER you travel, by sea or
by land, in places of work or
palaces of pleasure, you find the
friends of Camel. And since the
art of increasing life’s comfort
through smoking was discovered,
no other cigarette ever made and
kept so many friends.

Why does Camel lead the world?
Because only the choicest Turkish
and Domestic tobaccos are bought
for Camels. Because Camel is given
a blending that, regardless of price,

Man may learn to fly like a bird but |
he will never learn to sit on a barbed |
| wire fence.

can be found in no other cigarette.
Because the world’s largest to-
bacco organization spares neither
cost nor effort to make Camel the
utmost in cigarettes.

Camel rewards its friends with
never-ending peace and satisfac-
tion. Through the day and into
the night, it’s simply impossible to
smoke enough Camels to tire the
taste. We invite you to answer,
now, the world’s most popular
smoke invitation—Have a Camel!

How] Much Does the Weight of Your
Winter Coat Weigh With You?

Lots of heavyweight coats are actually less worn than those
of lighter, more closely woven fabrics---and they’re seldom as
styleful.

For chilly days you'll find one of our topcoats a great com-
fort with little weight.

HOT DOG!

A hungry dog once wandered
Into a butcher store;

The butcher threw some sausage
To the dog upon the floor.

The butcher said, “Now eat it,”
The dog said, “I decline,

For in that link of sausage I see,
That Old Gal o’ Mine.”
