Film Review

Pulp Fiction:
Quentin
Tarantino
strikes again

By A. Wilkinson Stump

Quentin Tarantino has a noto-
rious reputation around Holly-
wood. His movies have been char-
acterized as “pumping power-
houses” and sheer “blasts to the
heart.” After seeing his writing/
directing debut Reservoir Dogs a

few years ago I have been a sworn |

Tarantino fanatic, and he has yet to
disappoint me. His stories have an
amazing impact on my nerves and
by the end of each movie I am left
feeling as spent as... mmmm,
never mind. Pretend I never started
that thought. Anyway, Quentin
has done it again. His newest ef-
fort to hit the cinema is Pulp Fic-
tion, and I have to say that it is one
of the most original, daring movies
of all time. Playboy Magazine
gave it the highest rating of four
bunnies (so I hear), and this was
enough to send me into a state of
hyperactivity for the past two
weeks. After seeing it, lagree with
Hugh Hefner’s opinion.

Here’s a quick synopsis:

Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and .

Jules (Samuel Jackson in a bril-
liant performance) are henchmen
for crime lord Marsellus Wallace,

and they do what all henchman are
supposed to do, that is, make the
boss happy. Butch (Bruce Willis,

who is a badass) is an aging boxer
under Wallace’s control who even-
tually double-crosses the big man.
Uma Thurman (who is hot) is
Wallace’s wife, and she has a teeny-
tiny drug problem: The movie is
basically three stories wrapped up
into one big story, with John
Travolta as the only common thread
between all three. The vignettes
are: Vega must take Uma out fora
night out on the town courtesy of
the boss, but things go very awry.
Butch pisses off Marsellus, must
leave town, return to town, and
stay alive in the span of twelve
hours. And Jules faces a “transi-
tional state” and must decide
whether to remain a hitman or live
his life pursuing divine miracles.

Glamour Shots © Expose:
Uncovering the phenomenon

BEFORE

By Rachel Newcomb

When I walked into the Glam-
our Shots© studio I thought I was
visiting a Hollywood conception
of the dressing room of a showgirl.
There were bright lightbulbs ev-
erywhere, lining the mirrors that
encircle the make-up artists’
cubbies. Huge racks of brightly
colored clothes covered one whole
wall, and Top 40 dance music
pounded from the stereo. From time
to time different pictures would
flash onto a video monitor of
women dressed in all types of out-
fits, from pale yellow sundresses
to fierce biker jackets.

“Thavea 9:15 appointment,” I
told the smiling man behind the
desk.

“Great! We'll just have you

fill out this form and then we’ll do '

a wardrobe consultation.” He
handed me a clipboard question-
naire full of choices like ‘Hair:
Straight, Big Soft Curls, Tight
Bouncy Curls” or “Make-up: Ca-
sual Daytime, Dressy, Flashy
Evening.” I wanteditall. Ichecked
the box for the “big hair’ and

I wanted it all.

I checked the

box for the “‘big hair’’ and
“evening” look.

“evening” look.

“Feel free to browse through
the wardrobe and choose four out-
fits,” a man dressed entirely in
black told me. “Unless you brought
something you’d like to be photo-
graphed in. We have the evening
dresses and feathers over here.” I
flipped through the clothes in the
racks. The evening dresses con-
sisted of large colored sashes to be
draped over the shoulders while
perhaps wrapping yourself in a
feather boa. There were leather
jackets of every color, fringed
country & western coats with
matching cowboy hats, and pointy
cone-shaped tops that looked like
they had been taken from
Madonna’s last tour. Some of the
clothes looked like things you could
wear on the street without getting
stared at. But I had come to Glam-

our Shots tobe noticed, andI wasn’t
about to pick a demure brown jacket
or a frilly white blouse. After
lengthy consultation with the style
consultant, I picked a bright red
sequined jacket, a sequined vest
with silver and gold moons and
stars, ‘a tasteful mauve evening
wrap, and a tough black jacket
with zippers on the sides.

My stylist handed me a black
smock and told me to go into the
dressing room. With the smock on
I settled into the make-up artist’s
chair to be remade into whatever
they wanted me to be. The woman
who did my make-up was friendly
yet businesslike, not chatty like
some hairdressers can be. She
covered my head with fat rollers
and began to apply pale brown
foundation to my face with a small
sponge. WhileI watched, she lined

my eyes, coated my lashes thickly
with mascara, and painted my lips
a deep burgundy. I looked like I
was ready for the stage.

“Tt might look like a lot of
makeup, butit’s really noton film,”
she assured me. Then my hair
came down, or rather, went up,
depending on how you lookatit. It
was teased with combs and
hairspray until it surrounded my
head like a televangelist’s wife’s
hairdo.

“If you had bangs I could make
it bigger,” the stylist assured me,
trying in vain to fluff the front of
my hair.

Then it was time for the photo
shoot. I was led into the studio
where a short guy not much older
than me arranged my arms and
shoulders in various awkward po-
sitions for the camera. For each
outfit he handed me clip-on ear-
rings from a hanging plastic bag.
From time to time he’d make a
flirtatious comment.

“That’s a little kid’s vest,” he

Pierce Pettis entertained with

his six-string and moving lyrics

Blues Monday: Unplugged

by Dave Williard

In his October 3 performance
atthe Union’s Live Monday, acous-
tic guitarist and singer Pierce Pettis
revealed a wisdom and power of
humility that I rarely see in artists.
Drawing from both new and old
material, his ninety minute set
embraced an almost shocking emo-
tional depth.

“Being an artist makes you
different from other people,” Pettis
said. “As I get older, I realize what
has real quality. I think people get

quantity and quality mixed up.”
Instead of forcing a melody and
rhythm, Pettis subordinates his
guitar playing to the dynamics of
his voice. For him, music serves as
a medium for supporting lyrics.
Many of his songs carry a
melancholy tone. “Tinseltown,”
Pettis’s 1991 Windham Hill re-
lease, carries a sobering message
about the disappointments of life.
A few lines of the song “Swim-
ming” read, ““There’s a man saying
words over a body and the words

that he says are not his own/ And
his candle is so small.” Pettis is not
boastful about his work—he sees
us all drawing from the same well,
and this modest tone brings true
beauty to his songwriting and per-
formances. His musical intensity
recently culminated in his newest
release, “Chase the Buffalo.” With
David Hidalgo of Los Lobes and
Booker T.. Jones accompanying,
several western radio stations gave
Pettis Album of the Year awards.
The album’s success enabled him

to win a Nashville song-writing
contract and he is now gaining a
reputation as an up-and-coming
songwriter. “It’s really an honor
when other people sing my songs,”
Pettis said. “It’s like letting achild
go.”

I am excited to see such high
caliber artists coming to Davidson.
“Tt always feels good to know what
you’ re doing is right,” Pierce said
about his music. And it always is
areassurance to us that great artists
continue to gain exposure.
