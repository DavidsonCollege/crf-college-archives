Short Story

Make Do
by Sarah Zirkle

I used to feel sorry for myself
“cause I didn’t have nobody, no
body ‘cept my own. I’sa loner, on
loan to other people. My job’s
changed, but I still gets rented out.

I works for the Vanderlands,
well really I works for “Home
Maid,” ‘cause that’s what I am, a
maid for some other folk’s home.
That’s what I’s made for I guess. I
ain’tno home-maker. Ain’t gotno
house. My home’s where I makes
it. Where I gets by, but Lord,
sometimes it’s hard to come clean.

I ain’t never met the
Vanderlands, but they hired me
just the same, past and all. I passed
o.k. for them, Anyhows, the com-
pany must’e told ‘em. They says
they’s “obligated to pass on such
information.” Well, I reckon
ever’ body’s beholdn’ tosomebody
eranother. I ain’t holdin’ to nutten
‘cept my papers say I’m o.k.
Them’s what I hold to, they’s my
. pass'so’s I can work. Lotta folks
say ahome’s what I need. I oughta
be in a home they says, ‘cus they
wouldn’t wantme near theirs. They
passed me up. But that don’t make
no nevermind, that ain’t what I
come to pass on.

I takes a bus from the center
all the way ‘cross town. It'd take
days to walk. They says I can’t
take that much time. I ain’t ever
taken nutten that warn’t mine, but
times change. Now that I done
mine, it’s all I got left. I got left by
my maw. She run out, but time
don’t.

I knows I’s there when I sees
them big gates with them bars all
cold and shiney-like, reach’n right
up to the sky. I seen a lotta bars in
my time. I used to work at one, but
what I dun were dirty, so they says.
I didn’t know no better—no better
time, no better place. I dun told
you | ain’t got no place, never did.
My home’s where I made it. If I

didn’t make it, I din’t have no’

home. I knowd that. My mama
knowd it, too.
wouldn’t be here.
But I’s there when I sees that
gate, and that long drive snake’n
up to the house they call Paradise.
It was built long ‘fore there’s any-
thing else here, so I’s told. I walk
through the garden on the path, but
I can’t go in directly like I’s in the
family. I ain’t got none. (I goes in
back.) Idon’t know my father, but
I been look’n long as I can remem-
ber. I don’t know what I’d say to
him if’n I saw his face to face. I
s’pose I’d ask him why he made it
‘sos I’s here. But I ain’t found him
yet. Idon’teven know why I looks
‘cept somethin’ inside says he'd
take mein his home no matter what
dirt he had on me. He’d take me in
‘cause I’s his child an’ I been
wanderin’ all my life lookin’ for
him. (Well it ain’t like 1 got much
else to do ‘cept clean up.)

ARC Working to Move Into Charlotte

Coalition Aims to Provide City With Alternative Station

By Allison Wright

Does classical music leave you
cold? Do you find Bon Jovi’s
“Bed of Roses” to be anything but?
Do you have a sudden urge to
break an inanimate object if you
hear Billy Ray Cyrus’ “Achy
Breaky Heart” one more time? Or
does Madonna’s latest hit,
“Erotica,” fail to turn you on?

If you are looking for a radio
station with something different -
be it punk, funk, grunge, blues,
world music, folk, or reggae - you
have something in common with
the Alternative Radio Coalition
(ARC).

Rachel Stewart, head of

ie Hl
;

ARC’s music/operations commit-
tee and graduate of Davidson’s
class of ‘86, describes ARC as a
“grass roots community volunteer
organization dedicated to bringing
alternative music to Charlotte and
educating people about the oppor-
tunities and the need for it.”

The Alternative Radio Coali-
tion was started about a year ago
by people who share an interest in
music and who felt that people in
the music community were not
being represented on the air. They
plan on doing something about it.

One of the ARC’s primary
goals isto bring WNCW (88.7FM)

Phish's fourth album, Rift, came out last week.

Fourth Phish Release:
Expect the Unexpected

By Chris Hoveland

Last week Phish released their
fourth album, : Rift, their second
effort for Elektra. Rift features.all
the surprises that have come to be
expected from this New England
band: weird lyrics, far-out chord
progressions, and a synthesis of
styles which can only be Phish.
This album demonstrates that the
band has delved further into them-
selves and have not “sold out” de-
spite their ever-increasing popu-
larity.
; Anyone who was fortunate
enoughtocatch Phish at Davidson,
and who has an incredible aural
memory, will recognize several
songs from last year’s performance:

“Sparkle” (“. . . laughing, laugh-

ing, fall apart”), as well as “Horn”
and “It’s Ice.” The studio versions
have lost nothing of the live energy
heard at that performance. An-
other item to note is the recording
difference in this album compared
withA Picture ofNectar. Although

I don’t see any indication on the .

cover or liner notes, I think this
album was mixed on analogue tape
(as is Bela Fleck’s latest album)

which gives a much warmer over- .

all sound quality. Also, the band
overdubs quite a bit more on Rift
than on previous albums.

The album opens with the blu-
ish-grass title track, which features

e

the foot tap-inducing rhythm sec-
tion and a very catchy melody.
This song will probably be the
most frequently heard track on
campus. “Fast Enough for You”
will throw you for a loop— it’s a
country western song, pedal steel
and all. The same goes for “Maze”
which has a Police-ish bass line
and a thrashy chorus, and also
“Mound” which is simultaneously
a blues, reggae, and blue-grass
ditty. I can’t say they’re particu-
larly good songs, though. I admire
the band for stretching their sound,
but the last two songs mentioned
seem somewhat forced.

Most noteworthy of the new
tracks include “It’s Ice” which is
simply an incredibly well-written
and indescribable song (the text
isn’t even nonsensical); the funk/
jazz “Weigh,” the words of which
are humorously ridiculous; “The
Wedge” which I suppose could be
described as a Dead song with a
Latin swing beat; and “All Things

Reconsidered” which is an instru-

mental compositionreminiscent of
Anastasio’s ““Magilla” on Picture.

Rift, while perhaps not as
strong as A Picture of Nectar in
terms of consistently solid songs,
indicates the direction the band is
taking. They are obviously not

to Charlotte. WNCW is an alter-
native radio station based in
Spindale, N.C. and is affiliated with
Isothermal Community College.
To do this, the ARC needs $15,000
to finance a translator- the trans-

mitter needed to pick up and re-

broadcast WNCW’s original sig-
nal at another frequency in Char-
lotte. ,

Through public donations and
fundraising events such as “ARC
DJ Night” (to be held February 27,
8p.m., atthe Park Elevatorin Char-
lotte), the coalition hopes to have
the necessary funds within the year.

In addition to raising money

to purchase a translator, the ARC
is looking for aspiring disc jockeys

‘who would be willing to work an

overnight show at WNCW in
Spindale.

Stewart says that the station is
not looking for a hyped-up, gim-
micky, traditional DJ type. They
want the average person with a
genuine interest in music - some-
one open-minded who is willing to
explore musically.

Those whoare interested, have
questions, or just want to show
support for the Alternative Radio
Coalition, can call the ARC phone
line- 565-5093 - anytime.
