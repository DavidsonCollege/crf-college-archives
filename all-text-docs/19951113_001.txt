Kelton gets scoop on US News ranking

Davidson’s drop to 21 inspires executive assistant to travel to New York

Davidson’s drop in the U.S.
News and World Raeport s rank-
ing of national liberal arts colleges
is due primarily, if not entirely, to
procedural changes in the way the
magazine calculates the standings
‘and a computational error on the
part of the magazine, according to
John Kelton, executive assistant to
the president.

Kelton travelled to New York
and met with the editors of the
college guide to learn exactly how

Into The Streets Week is a
national service week (November
5-12) that promotes involvemerit
in the community through a posi-
tive donation of one’s time.

Davidson participates in Into
The Streets Week through its af-
filiation with the Campus Outreach
Opportunity League (C.O.O.L.),
one of thirty national service orga-
nizations that started Into The
Streets Week.

During these eight days, col-
leges all around the country par-
ticipate in this token of community
out-reach in order to acknowledge
problems and issues specific to
their area and also to publicize the
opportunities that are available for
those who feel the need to serve.

Only schools that are con-
nected with one or more of the
thirty service organizations that
initiated Into The Streets Week
celebrated this focus on service.

Reach Out, the Davidson Col-
lege service umbrella organization,
sponsored issues that were world-
wide in focus, as well as problems

the ranking —and Davidson’s drop
— came about.

The rankings come from: a
compilation of six statistical cat-
egories which are given different
weight depending on their per-
ceived importance to college edu-
cation. These categories are Aca-
demic Reputation, Student Selec-
tivity, Faculty Resources, Reten-
tion Rate (which was called gradu-
ation rate in 1994, but was ex-
panded to include retention of first-
year students in 1995), Financial
Resources, and Alumni Satisfac-
tion. Davidson’s rank in 3 of the

categories remained unchanged,
and they improved in Student Se-
lectivity, but a drop in Faculty and
Financial Resources was the rea-
son for Davidson’s overall drop.

“The drop had nothing to do
with a drop in our standards or our
quality,” John Kelton says. “It had
to do with their computations and
their changes in weights.”

U.S. News and World Report
did shift some emphasis from Stu-
dent Selectivity (which was
weighted 25% in 1994 and 15% in
1995) to Retention Rate (which
rose from 15% to 25%), but

Davidson was very strong in both
of these categories in both years
and this change produced a negli-
gible difference in rating.

The category where Davidson
fell most dramatically was in Fac-
ulty Resources. Of the 161 schools
ranked as national liberal arts col-
leges Davidson fell from 18 to 49.
The rankings for this category are
determined by 5 factors: average
faculty compensation, the percent-
age of faculty with a terminal de-
gree, the percentage of faculty that
are full-time, the student to faculty
ratio, and class size.

Davidson does not have sta-
tistics for all national liberal arts
colleges, so it cannot rank itself
relatively, but, according to Kelton,
the college improved last year in ,
every one of the factors determin-
ing faculty resources except class
size, where it remained unchanged.

Kelton says the perceived drop
in Faculty Resources happened
because of the change in the weight
that each of these factors was given
in determining the ranking within
that category.

"Using the’CAT Gard Off-Campus, at cOpiers and
vending machines on campus, new menu options at the
Commons, and new and more laundry machines in the
dorms were all on the agenda for last Thursday’s town
meeting.

SGA President Bill Gullan and many SGA sena-
tors gathered in the Union Conference Room with
Richard Terry, head of Auxiliary Services, and Dee
Philips, purchasing/production manager for the Com-
mons, to answer student questions.

Many issues were brought. up by the SGA and
Auxiliary Services personnel, but the issue of using the
CAT card off-campus was discussed in the most depth.

The proposal is to contract with off-campus mer-
chants. Davidson would get a percentage of the
profits.

There are a few obstacles standing in the way of
the idea, which Davidson legal counsel Burt Landis is
investigating.

The government scrutinizes ideas like this, be-
cause of the non-profit status of the College. Davidson
would be acting as a bank if CAT cards were used off-
campus, which would require that more formal state-
ments of declining balances be issued.

A formal way to dispute any disagreements over
purchases would also be needed to insure student’s
rights.

Also the technology needed to scan CAT cards
would have to be purchased by any business participat-

A pilot program with a few businesses was sug-

If the idea worked well, the program could be extended
to more businesses, with the exception of grocery
stores because they sell alcohol.
