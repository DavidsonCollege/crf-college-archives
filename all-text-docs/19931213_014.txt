MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1993

By Robert Lloyd-Still

The jinx is finally over. After
losing nine consecutive games to
UNCC, Davidson (3-1) defeated
the Forty-Niners 71-65 Saturday
night. This came after a 77-68 loss
earlier in the week to Wake Forest.
This was the biggest win for the
Davidson basketball program since

beating the University of Miami —

two years ago, and it came with
former Davidson greats Lefty
Dreisell and Fred Hetzel in atten-
dance.

“This was a great win for us.
We have struggled in the five years
I have been here against UNCC,”

Coach Bob McKillopstated.“Win-
ning this neighborhood rivalry was
so important to our seniors: Jason
Zimmerman, Janko Narat, Ron
Horton, and Chris Shields. It was a
great environment with lots ofsup-
port from the students.”

This game also marked the
coming-out party for sophomore
Quinn Harwood. With 3,068 fans
in attendance, Harwood was tre-
mendous, posting career highs with
19 points and 11 rebounds. With
starters George Spain and Bran-
don Williams in early foul trouble,
Harwood delivered offensively,
defensively, and with the intan-

gibles. He made key shots, impor-
tant rebounds, and hit four clutch
free throws down the stretch.

His most important shot came
with the Cats clinging to a 57-54
lead andonly 5:47 remaining. With
the shot clock down to one second,
Harwood drilled a three pointer
from deep in the corner. That shot
extended the lead to six and the
Cats never looked back.

“He was simply superb. He
had a double-double,” Coach
McKillop said. “He played like the
kindof player we recruited. A great
performance.”

Davidson also got a solid per-

Harwood leads Davidson to win over UNCC

formance from Senior Janko Narat.
The Yugoslavian native scored 20
points and was 12-14 from the free
throw line. Brandon Williams
added eight for the Cats and his
three point play with only a minute
left sealed the victory for Davidson.
George Spain and Jeff Anderson
added six points each for the Wild-
cats and sophomore Chris Alpert
kept the Cats steady, playing a
team-high 38 minutes.

UNCC would much rather
forget this game. Last year’s hero

Coastal takes
women's b-ball
in a nailbiter

By Neil Marks

A nailbiter. The Davidson
women’s basketball team lost a
close one to Coastal Carolina 60-
58 Saturday, dropping its record to
1-5. The Cats had to play catch-up
throughout the first half, but kept it
close thanks in part to Erin
Butcher’s hot hand. She scored 11
points in the first half, including
two with eight seconds left to nar-
row the Chanticleer lead toa single
bucket. :

_. Coastal came out hard in the
second half, going on a 14-0 run
and leaving the Cats down by 12.

Sophomore guard Tonya
Sharpe explained the Chanticleer
run saying, “We should have got-
ten tighter on defense when they
started pulling away. Weshouldn’t
have fouled as much, but they did
well to pick up on some opportuni-
ties and seize the momentum.”

Coach John Filar added, “We
were shooting too early on offense
and we let them get some easy
buckets in transition.” Davidson
later countered with a 13-0 run of
its own and tie the game at 50 with
just over six minutes to play.

Down by two in the final
minute, Davidson had three op-
portunities to tie off of missed
Coastal Carolina foul shots. But
the Cats could not convert.

Despite the loss, the team was
happy with their performance.

Coach Filar remarked, “The
past couple of games we weren’t
playing two good halves. We usu-
ally experience a let down in the
second half. A win would have
been great today, but the effort and
intensity was worth more.”

Coach Filar also wanted to
thank the biggest crowd of the sea-
son by saying, “I hope they under-
stand how important they are. It’s
exciting to hear the Davidson
crowd get involved. If they keep
coming back, we’ll keep giving
the effort.”

The team will now enjoy a
long break, with its next game not
until January 3 when UNC-
Wilmington will come to face the
Wildcats at home. Because the
team is only a partial member of
the Southern Conference, it is in-

Junior Thad Reece dives to success

By Matt Pitzer

One of the things that junior
Thad Reece !oves so much about
diving, that has caused him to dedi-
cate much of hi: time to that sport,
and thathas helped promote him to
dive team captain and quasi-coach
is, simply, pain.

“You’re standing there on a
three-meter board about to try
something you’ve never done be-
fore in your life with a good chance
of going Smack! in the water,”
Reece said. “Fear of pain.is a high
motivator to do well.”

If so, then perhaps a list of
Reece’s strengths should include
his ability to respond to motiva-
tion. Because he has been fearful,
or maybe wise, enough to work
hard at his sport and become the
leader of the dive team in just his
fourth overall year of diving.

In fact, he has garnered enough
respect among his peers and
coaches toserveas the team’s coach
on road trips this season. Marsha
Waymouth, the team’s regular
coach, holds another position at
the Lake Norman YMCA and is
unable to accompany the team
when it travels to other schools.

The team has traveled quite a
bit thus far, including one stretch

eligibleforthe NCAA toumament. . with five straight. away-matcbes,

allowing Reece to frequently serve
a role he loves, even if occasion-
ally he feels wary in that position.

“It’s tough,” he said, “because
sometimes you feel hypocritical
when you tell someone who does
the dive better than you what he’s
doing wrong. But the team’s real
close. I think the team trusts me. .
.. Itmakesit easier for me knowing
that they trust me.”

“The rest of the team helps me
with my dives, too,” he added.
“They know what to look for. It’s
reciprocal. I don’t miss out on any-

' thing. I just have to watch every-

one.” While Reece misses nothing

now, he will miss the goal of the’

entire diving season--the confer-
ence championships in March--
spending next semester in Ireland.

“As excited as I am about go-
ing abroad,” Reece said, “it’s defi-
nitely disappointing to miss out on
finals and the competition against
everyone when it’s for medals. It’s

definitely a mixture of feelings. . .

. Ithas been hard to stay motivated
this year knowing that I won’t be
here in the spring . . . hard not to
slip into the defeatist mode know-
ing that I’m going to forget every-
thing I’ve learned this season.”
Reece took up diving in his
senior year at the North Carolina

High School for Science and Math
under the tutelage of the diving
coach at UNC-Chapel Hill. He and
one other diver would drive over to
the university afterits practice since
Science and Math did not have
adequate diving facilities.

He started with immediate

success, placing ninth in the state.

in his first season. He has followed
that up with finishes in the top half
of the conference since he’s been
at Davidson.

He said he was interested in .

diving since childhood, and one of
factors that made him decide to
relinquish a starting position on
the high school basketball team
was that he knew he could con-
tinue diving in college.

“I knew that I wouldn’t have
much of a place on a college bas-
ketball team,” Reece said. “But
there’s really no bench in diving
and I knew that if I went to a small
college like Davidson that I would
have a good opportunity to dive.”

Reece has taken full advan-
tage of that opportunity and hopes
to one day parlay that into a coach-
ing position. But until then, there is
still that slight problem of going
Smack! in the water, one that when
overcome, produces the beauty of

Cat Nips
The hoopcats
are back in

full force

By Jason Byassee

If you weren’t in Belk Arena
Saturday night for the Davidson/
UNCC game, shame on you.

That was just a great basket-
ball game, the kind of game that
allows you to walk out into the
December night in a little better
mood than when you came in. Ora
lot better.

Now, Ihaven’tseenastat sheet
on the other night and I wasn’t
sitting courtside with all the jour-
nalist hotshots, but from the stand-
point of the average Davidson fan,
you couldn’t have asked for a bet-
ter game. Well, aside from the fact
that there were a few empty seats.
And that Charlotte did bring a lot
of fans with them.

In fact I’d like to thank those
49er fans now, for not only did
they make the trek up I-77 to visit
our lovely campus, but they added
their own unique blend of class
and style to the contest as well. I
mean, the way they did those “Let’s
go Niners” and “D-D-D-Defense”
cheers, you’d figure there’d be no
way Davidson could win. Andboy,
when they were doing their “BS”
chant for the umpteenth time, I
could tell the refs feelings were
really starting to get hurt. Good
work guys.

Seriously, one high point of
the game was sparked by the UNCC
fans. They were trying to rattle
Wildcat freshman guard Brian
Donnelly by hollering every time
he touched the ball. It was funny to
hear them trying to intimidate
Donnelly on his own home court.
Anyway, they quit when he stepped
upand drilled a three pointer amidst
their yelling. Nice try, geniuses.
Boy, its great to have the last word.

The jawing between fans is
such a key part of any game. This
time, our guys happened to be the
ones backing up the talk. We were
even so kind as to graciously re-
mind UNCC that not only is our
current hoops team superior to
their’s, but our tradition is, too.
Lefty Dreisell was inducted into
the Davidson hall of fame at half-
time, a thank you for the dominant
Davidson teams of Johnston Gym
and the 1960s. The induction of the
Left-Hander only added to the post-
game sweetness savored by Wild-
cats everywhere.

It was a night when the Char-
lotte fans would gohome bummed-
out. Davidson played like a team _
of veterans, and they seemed to be
in control throughout. Alpert was
the floor general, Janko scored his
points, and Brandon Williams
made a point to jump through the
roof every now and again. But the
real story was Quinn Harwood.

The guy was on fire! He was
on the boards, both on offense and
defense. He’snotas bigas UNCC’s
inside guys; heck, he’s not as big
