To The Fraternities

There once was a time a Davidsen when

the nine social fraternities took a lead in | higher plane. Four major dance sets are
~sponsored by Davidson each year:

extra currienlar aetiyities. Fhese groups
urged, and sometimes. eVen, foreed, their
members and pledges to go out ior ditier-

leaders of various activities, sueh ase pub-

lieations, managerships, ete, had no trou-—

e.. They had men to work with them and
could mould them into potential leaders.

This custom is slowly fading. Take The
Davidsonian, for, instanee. Onee Monday
night was known to every member of tic
Student body. and cspeciaily to the fresh.
men and sophomore classes. as the night
that the Davidsonian went to press. The
Davidsonian office was jammed to the ceil.
ing with reporters and the paper went to
press with little or no trouble.

Rue Now! [ Seems that the soca
ternities have slackened. No longer do they
urge their pledges and sophomores to work
ior such Davidson activities. Of course.
they might tell their underclassmen that
itis a good thing to: work on such things.
but when these men drop out, not because
of studies. not because they haven’ got
wnough time for such publications. but sim-
ply because they'd rather go to a movie.

During the past two wecks, this has been.
notecable more. than ever and as a result,
the managing editors have had to work un-
til the wee. smal! hours of the night. To
cope with the situatiom the Davidsonian
staff is going to take drastic measures. Boys

On Flowers

Again, as our first dance set of the ycar
nears, comes up an old question. Should. the
Davidson student body abolish the practice
of buying corsages for their dates at Da-
vidson dances. [Year after year it has been
brought up with no results. This year it
should be settled, either by a vote from the
entire student ‘body or by any method
deemed advisable by those in charge of thé
dances.

There is only one reason why Davidson—
