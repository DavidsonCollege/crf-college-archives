BURNEY TELLS OF HIS
MOUNTAIN MISSION WORK

At the regular meeting of the Volunteer
Band, L. P. Burney gave some of his obser-
vations and ‘experiences concerning the
Home Mission work in the Blue Ridge moun-
tains. He spoke particularly of those moun-
tains in Virginia situated at the source of
the Dan river.

“The first thing that one notices,”
Burney, “in these mountains, especially in the
late Spring, is the exquisite beauty of nature
and the far-reaching view from the moun-
tain tops. Upon closer observation, however,
small, crude log cabins may be seen. If you
know their conditions, you will ask yourself,
‘Why have these people never known God?
Why hate they no education? Why have
their children no Sunday School? Why are
their family circles Christless?’ ‘Their con-
ditions are never exaggerated; it is impos-
sible to picture them unless you have once
seen them.”
moral standard, consequently, is

“These people are not responsible
living 30 to 35 mites
from any civilization. Their ignorance is
responsible for their sins.” Burney asked,
“Who is to blame, these people who know
no better, or we who live near them and ‘have

education and Christianity, but do not go and
teach them?”

Burney concluded by saying that such con-
ditions almost draw him away from his reso-
lution to become a foreign missionary, but if
these people are in such a condition in the
most civilized nation on earth, how fearful
must be the lives of many in pagan countries.

BIBLE CLASSES DISCUSS
' CHOICE OF LIFE WORK

The mid-week Bible classes met last Wed-
nesday night at 9 p. m. The topic for ats-
cussion was, “How Do Campus Choices Af-
fect Life Work?” The subject deals directly
with the choosing and preparing for a voca-
tion, Making the right decision in regard to
a life work is next in iniportance only to be-
coming a Christian. In a great number of
cases this great decision is made in a very
haphazard way. The que stion, “At What
Can I Make the Most Money?” causes many
too often also distinction is the sole

a misfit;
object of a man in his profession, Some men
find it so easy to drift along that they just
drift into the first job available, either for
the money it may pay, or for the easy life
that it may present. The line of least resis-
tance is not a straight road to success.

It is the part of a Christian to avoid choos-
ing his life work in the ways mentioned. He

shouid do all in his power to find the place in
which he will fit. This may be done by find-
ing what he is best suited to do,’ what he
would like to do, and what he is divinely ap-
pointed to do; talent plus inclination and in-
spiration, It is distinctly a college problem
because at this period of a man’s career the
real life work is chosen; a mah knows what
he can do, what he would like to do, and
should find out what he ought to do. If
obstacles present themselves they are not
always a test of one’s power to overcome
them, but may he meant to turn one from the
path that he is following into a better one.
