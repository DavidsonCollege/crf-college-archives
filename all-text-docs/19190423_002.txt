BACK TO ALMA MATER.

Back to the old campus, Fellows. Your
Alma Mater will be looking for you,
From Saturday night, May 24th until
Wednesday afternoon, May 28th, there
will not be one idle moment.

The classes of ‘99 and ‘14 are plan-
ning big reunions. Other classes should
not let these get ahead of them. ‘o9, 'o4,
‘og, '89, '84 and '79 are also scheduled
for reunions this year. Fellows, where
is your “pep?” Back to Alma Mater.

We are looking for you, so don’t dis-
appoint us.

GREATER DAVIDSON CLUB.

The men of Davidson have begun a
great and noble work. With a spirit of
liberty, fraternity and equality — they
have laid the cornerstone of a greater
Davidson.

April toth, 1919, will long be re-
membered as the beginning of a new
era in the history of our Alma Mater.
On that day the student body assem-
bled and formed a Greater Davidson
Club.

The purpose of the club is just as its
name implies, “A Greater Davidson.”
This can be accomplished only through
carnest effort on the part of every Da-
vidson man, both graduate and under-
égraduate.

Let “Forward” be our watchword and
let us have 400 students as our goal for
the year 1919-1920. Forward with your
faith, Fellows!

Adopt yourself the personal idea of
thrift—right. saving and thoughtful
spending. Include your country's finan-
cial welfare by using the National Thrift
idea—War Savings Stamps. Think of
yourself and your earning power as a Na-
tional asset. There is no finer patriotism
than this.

- we are now beginning to play.

SAYINGS OF NAPOLEON.

Imagination rules the world.

Force without intelligence is nothing.

No man’s loss is irreparable; for no
man is indispensable.

They should have knowledge who seek
to govern others.

‘Men are led by trifles.

It is but a step from the sublime.to the
ridiculous,

There are two means of moving men—
interest and fear.

When a man is bent on public office
he has already sold himself.

I conquer provinces, but
wins hearts.

‘The only victory over love is found in
flight.

A faithful. friend is the true image of
Deity itself.

Death overtakes the coward, but nev-
er the brave man until his hour — has
come.—Scrap Book.

Josephine

The man who works with a song on
his lips and in his heart will always put
one over on the man who has a growl
in his throat.

“The don’t-care chap is the chap with-
out the dollar, without a future without
a home in his old age. He is the fellow
who toys with the gift of ability the Al-
mighty has given him and forgets that
his strength is not everlasting. He is ob-
livious to the fact that today—by hard
work, by loyalty to his job, by capacity
to get returns on merit—he must save
up for tomorrow.”

Asa rule it isn’t your work; its YOU.
So buckle up your determination, smile
down discouragement. and hit old work
a wallop that will Huor it. That means
success,

“Get ready and the chance will come.”
(Lincoln.) Save intelligently and put
your savings into interest-bearing, abso-
lutely safe investments—Thrift and War
Savings Stamps. Then that chance will
find you ready.

The Government inspector will pay
us a visit soon, Are you ready for him?
Which company will get: his commenda-
tion, ‘The Davidson unit is one of the
largest in the State. It is up to us to
make it the best.

Little acts of thoughtlessness will ruin
a pretty campus. Let your heart and head
guide you away from those ugly paths.
Use the pretty lawn but don’t abuse it.
Get the Greater Davidson spirit.

Lincoln said: “Teach economy.” That
is one of the first and highest virtues.
[1 begins with saving money. Thrift and
War Savings Stamps means saving mon-
ey without hoarding.

“Little

Benjamin = Franklin said:
strokes fell great oaks.” Every
Stamp brings nearer a War
Stamp.

VICTOR HUGO'S DREAM.
Victor Hugo in his day was called a
dreamer. He preached wildely beauti-
ful things, which were too good to come
true—it was thought. The following is
one of his ‘dreams:” “The day will come

a cannon ball will be exhibited in public
museums just as an instrument of tor-
ture is now, and the people will be as-
tonished how such a thing could have
been. A day will come when these two
immense groups, the United States of
America and the United States of Europe
shall be seen extending the hand of fel-
lowship across the ocean, exchanging
their products, their industry, their arts,
their genius, clearing the earth, peopling
the deserts, improving the creation under
the eye of the Creator, and uniting for
the gond of all these two irresistible
and infinite powers—fraternity of men
and the power of Goad.”

LONESOME}

Are you lenesome? Do you ever get
homesick and wish to be back ‘‘some-
where in Virginia” and perhaps seeing a
certain little ‘someone’ tonight? If you
keep busy you won't have time for vapor-
ings and wishings and homesickness. If
you have any spare time from your les-
sons (most of those who pass their work
do not, but you may be one of these men
of “exceptional intellect”) take up a
course of reading. Read up on South
America, Look up the history of your
State. Find out just what the underly-
ing causes of the Great War were. Ex-
plore South Africa and Australia via the
printed page. If reading does not inter-
est you take up some hobby. Fix up a
miniature telegraph set to the room of a
friend or on the arm of your chair, Learn
the Morse and Continental codes. You
may be very glad you can “send” or
“receive” some day. In the evening try
a little signalling. Practice up on the
rifle range. Those “Sharpshooter” and
“Expert Marksman” badges count much
towards a commission. Read up your
I. D. R. and your Moss’ Manual, if you
have one. Participate in college activi-
ties. Some men are better known their
first year than other men who have spent
four years at college, Interest yourself
in others. ‘Take an interest in athletics.
Do your share to make your college paper
and its annual a success. To attain un-
usual proficiency in your studies at the
expense of putside interests is to develop
one part of your brain at the expense of
the other. Don’t be lop-sided. Keep
busy.— Virginia ‘Tech.

OUR ALMA MATER-—WHAT IT
MEANS.

Fellows, if you have never realized
what our Alma Mater means to us, you
should have been at G. W. C. on Satur-
day night. As soon as we started to sing
our Alma Mater every Clemson man
in the audience jumped to attention. Sev-
eral old ladies who were ardent Clem-
son supporters stood up soon after we
started, and before.we got to the chorus
every G. W. C. girl in the audience was
standing at attention.—The Tiger.

Clemson's Alma Mater is no better
than ours, See the April oth issue of
The Davidsonian and learn it for com-
mencement,

LOST IN THE GLARE OF THE
KHAKI.

We all sing praise to the khaki lad,
To him the world’s credit is due,
But use both your eyes
And please recognize
The men of the sea in blue.

GIVE THEM ROPE.

While the Germans marching through
a Belgian province, one of them said
snecringly to a farmer sowing seed:

“You may sow, but we shall reap.”

“Well, perhaps you may,” was the re-
ply. “I am sowing hemp.”— Montreal
Journal of Commerce.

Simple Explanation—“Your husband
tells me he has quit betting on horses!”
“Oh, dear!” exclaimed young Mrs.
Torkins. “Charley broke again!”
—Washington Star.

PIANO TUNING

You notice those who play
a Violin, Guitar or other
string instrument always
tighten the strings and get
them in tune every time
they begin to play. For
similar reasons pianos need
regular tuning — though
not so often. Oncea year
is generally advised. The
spring is the best season for
this work — because the
weather conditions are
more uniform and favora-
ble.
My work may be examined by
the one you think is the best
judge either at the Gym, the
ome of Dr. Richards or Mr.
J. R. Withers, Davidson. All

interested telephone 17-J, or
