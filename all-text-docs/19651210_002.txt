Another Edition

This month’s edition of the drinking
rule represents, we believe, a progres-
sive step, at least, beyond the unreal-
istic bounds by which Davidson stu-
dents were held until two months
ago.

The action taken Wednesday by the
faculty does evidence a retreat—an
all too obvious one—from the amend-
ments which were approved at. the
October meeting, however minor the
most recent changes may seem to be.

Simple guesswork and the faintest
awareness of developments since the
October meeting of the Board of Trus-
tees would disclose that this week’s
changes were brought about by a rest-
lessness concerning possibly further
Trustee reaction to once-intrepid fac-
ulty decisions.

There was certainly sincere concern
also for the responsibility which the
October rule would have placed on
coaches and others charged with
shepherding students away from the
Davidson campus.

Viewed from this aspect, then, the
action this week does represent a rea-
sonable compromise.

Significant steps have definitely
been taken; for example, students
drinking at fraternity after-parties
need no longer be uncertain as to
whether they are breaking a rule—
they are not. Too, alcoholic bever-.
ages can legally be stored in auto-
mobile trunks.

On the other hand, certain factions
are satisfied now once again in that
Davidson College is still on record as
frowning upon, and thereby sup-
posedly discouraging, the use of alco-
holic beverages by students. And the
coaches need no longer have that
lonesome feeling in trying to set and
enforce rules they feel are necessary.

As one acute observer remarked to
us yesterday, “The drys get their pro-
hibition, and the wets get their liquor

. . . and everyone should be satis-
fied.”

But we are not.

Certainly we can see progress. But
we also see the effects of political she-
nanigans—the plain case of deciding
only about just what the Trustees can
be talked into going along with.

It is a hopeless string of legalisms
woven from the dull threads of para-
dox.

The college is opposed to the use
of alcoholic beverages by students—
unless the student is married and has
a home in the Town of Davidson.

The eollege wants to protect its
good name. by being represented of-
ficially only by sober-looking gentle-
men — but, in areas in which the
school can disclaim any direct finan-
cial responsibility. the concern some-
how lessens, and practically disap-
pears.

We fully agree with the fact that
the college has the right, and essen-
tially the duty, to protect its name—
for the sake, among others, of its stu-
dents.

And we likewise uphold the desir-
ability of all concerned for reason-
able standards of behavior to be ex-
ercised by students both on and off
the campus.

And we emphatically agree that the
intemperate use of alcohol is not a
desirable practice on the part of any-
one.

Ultimately, however, the old rule
and its present revision effect nothing
whatsoever to foster among students
a truly mature attitude toward alco-
hol, its uses and its dangers.

In making of drinking a glamorous
and rebellious act, the college is most
unfortunately discouraging the devel-
opment of such an attitude. which we
believe is the college’s precise respon-
sibility to inculcate at this time more
than ever.

The Inherent Risk

The Student Council’s decision this
week to abrogate its primary obliga-
tion along with that of the Honor
Court, in the enforcement of the Stu-
dent Body Regulations is a terrific
slap in. the face of student initiative
at Davidson.

Clamoring out of three months of
dawdling and discussions. the council
has grabbed at a speculative and vis-
jionary change which does appear at
first to be a grand idea for equalizing
the enforcement of student conduct
rules.

It would be an ideal situation for
each student to be effectively bound
to uphold such regulations, but un-
fortunately this is far from the actual
case. Rather, in this instance, every
one’s business would eventually be no
one’s business.

The council has lifted the toughest
load off the shoulders of student lead-
ers, including its own members, but
it has not provided for the future care
of this costly item called student judi-
cial initiative.

We sympathize with student leaders
who may have to squeal on a friend.
But we cannot commiserate students
who would so smoothly relieve them-
selves of such a responsibility under
the inevitable circumstances.

Sooner or later the loss of effective
student enforcement will result in the
unfortunate dissipation of what has
come to be vital student interest in
his own affairs.

The eventual takeover by the fac-
ulty of the enforcement of student
conduct regulations due to ineffective

or inept control by students them-
selves is inevitable. Such a conse
quence is too high a price to pay for a
little easier and more comfortable life
on, campus for the elected student
leaders.

What needs to be done instead is to
effect a clearer distinction between
the meaning and significance of the
Student Body Regulations and the
Honor Code.

What would be a more apropos
change in this area, then, would be to
remove the enforcement of the rela-
tively less important conduct rules
from the Honor Court, in order that
the court might be solely involved
with honor offenses. “Thus, the Stu-
dent Council would retain enforce-
ment, and thereby the effective con-
trol and initiative, in matters of stu-
dent conduct.

The council would do well to re-
consider its drastic step along the
lines of a more prudent adjustment
of the problem in this area.

In the same manners, balloting next
week on the maintenance of each item
in the Student Body Regulations
should definitely be preceded by a
full discussion on the implications and
possible repercussions of the rescis-
sion of all regulations.

The inherent risk in abrogating
either the rules or the responsibility
of enforcing them is much too great
to be tried.

The inequity which exists concern-
ing the enforcement of these two sets
of rules can be corrected without
placing personal alleviations above the
est interests of the entire student

ody.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Queens’ Girl ‘Clarities'
Harrington's ‘Generalities’

Dear Editor:

Mike Harrington's article has
started some discussion on the
Queens Campus. While maybe
not a “typical” southern school
(if there is such a place), on
campus are girls from the deep
South to the far North; many
are displeased with the genera-
lities Mike expressed.

The Southern girls Mike is re-
ferring to are in college. They
don’t get a degree just by
being pretty. They could not
have even gotten into any col-
lege if they had not been on the
same intellectual level as boys
in high school. Class standing is
not based on sex.

Do Northern girls read more?
the subscription to Time and
Newsweek on this campus are
numerous. ‘How many boys at
Davidson know who Ernest
Nagel is and care about Viet
Nam except in terms of draft
laws?

The Seven Sisters Schools are
in or near large cities. The
newspapers are usually superior
and cultura! opportunites -are
vast. The girls are aware of
more because they're jin the
middle of more — but so are the.
boys they date!

There is really not that much
difference in what is accep‘ab ~
conyersation for dating in te
two sections. Northern dates @o
not consist of discuss’ng the
world situation for three houre
What is discussed depends on
the boys as well as the girls in-
volved. If Southern boys want
Southern girls to show their in-
tellegence, they will. We've got
brains and are using them.

Dear Editor:

I find myself wanting partly
to disagree with, and partly to
second Steve Graham's letter
of Dec. 2.

Since Davidson College is a
private institution, its trustees
have the right to require what
they do, both of students and
faculty — and more, if they
deem it wise. Whether their re-
quirements are sound is quite
another matter.

I am bothered by the fact that
so little. ss said by anyone at
Davidson about what relation-
ship there may be between
Christianity and the liberal art.

So-called conservatives tend to
maintain Davidson's Christian
commitment without defending
it. Admittedly, the present form
of Davidson’s commitment is
hard to defend: it looks suspic-
iously like a commitment to
Southern Protestant culture-re-
ligion — this is. it is a form of
Christian commitment that. is
provincial, moralizing, and pos-
s‘hty anti-intellectual.

So-called liberals, on the other
side. seem often to be holding
out. for some kind of bland toler-
ance, a sort of unqualified re-
lativism. Such a position is as
dogmatic as the ‘‘conservative"’
one, and possibly as superficial
and uninteresting, besides.

It is important to grapple with
uncritically held assumptions on
bo‘h sides. It is unrealistic to as-
sume that there are no conflicts
between Christianity and the
liberal arts tradition; there are,
and always have been.

The liberal arts have never
been completely Christian in
their orientation, and are now
Christian only in a partial and

derivative sense. But it is also
unrealistic to assume that the-
ological convictions are always
vague and indefensible, while
the convictions of academic
liberalism are always clear and
reasonable.

I think a case can be made
for a Christian liberal arts col-
lege. Such a case would have to
take seriously the notion that
faith and learning should im-
pinge upon one another. This is
a very different thing from pre-
senting learning in such a way
that it does not disturb faith,
or faith in such a way that it
does .not disturb learning.

A Christian liberal arts col-
lege must hold two loyalties in
tension: one to Christianity, and
the other to the liberal arts tra-
dition as it presently exists. If
this implies the presence of a
lively Christian community with-
in the academic one, it also
implies the presence of a num-
ber .of non-Christians who are
not ir some way disenfranchised
or coerced because they are not
Christians.

The Trustees of Davidson are
just that — stewards who are to
operate the college for the bene-
fit of the students and the
Church. Students will be bene-
fitted by good education: but it
is not clear how far the Trustees
are committed to good educa-
tion, since they have not allow-
ed the assembling of a represen-
tative liberal arts faculty. (And,
let’s face it, ideas are not best
represented by those who dis-
agree with them.) And I cannot
see that the Church is benefitted
by regulations which present it
as overbearing and repressive.

‘Film Friends’ To Present
Foreign Adventure Films

By WILLIAM TROTTER
A Preview

Film fere at Davidson will be
exceedingly rich during the next
few weeks. Beginning Monday
and running through Wednesday
will be the highly-praised film
version of Eugene O'Neill's clas-
sic play, A LONG DAY'S JOUR-
NEY INTO NIGHT. The film
was directed by Sidney Lumet.
whose most recent films include
THE PAWNBROKER and THE
HILL.

Running with the O'Neil adap-
tation will be a zaney short
subject called AN ANDY WAR-
HOL SAMPLER. Warhol! is the
man who made ‘‘Pop Art’ what
it is today, and this film gives
peeks at a number of his no-
torious motion pictures. includ-
ing SLEEP, KISS, EAT, and
EMPTRE. Film Friends’ sea-
son's ticket holders will be ad-
mitted free on Monday night
only.

A LONG DAY'S JOURNEY
INTO NIGHT won great acclaim
when it first appeared and was
well-received during a recent
brief engagement in Charlotte.
This is an ideal opportunity for
those interested in the drama to
see a really first rate film adap-
tation of a great play.

Highlighting the Film Friends’
showings in January will be one
of the more recent films of the

great Japanese director, Kuro-
sawa. YOJIMBO is a lusty,
swinging. blood-and-thunder Sa-
murai story, which subtly paro-
dies the violence and senseless-
ness of modern civilization.

Although the. film literally
reeks with high-spirited blood-
letting, it manages. at one and
the same time, to be appallingly
funny. As Time magazine put
it in a review: ‘‘many custom-
ers will wonder whether to laugh
or scream.”’ Kurosawa, clearly
wants us to do both.

YOJIMBO stars Toshiro Mi-
fune, a magnificent actor-athlete
who has dominated a series of
Kurosawa’'s films with such fi-
nesse and coolness that he
makes the violence in the films
a thing of terrible beauty.

In YOJIMBO, Misfune plays
a down-and-out Samurai whose
sword is for hire to the highest
bidder. If this sounds sus-
piciously like the opening bit for
a western, it is intended to. Ku-
rosawa’s THE SEVEN SAM-
URAI was stolen several years
ago to make a gaudy horse-
opera called THE MAGNIFI-
CENT SEVEN.

Here, Kurosawa turns the
tables and gives his story the
outlines of a typical. B grade
western. In the hands of a less
shrewd and brilliant director,
this could have ruined the film.

With Kurosawa's acute sense of
satire, it merely enhances the
richness of the story line.

Mifune appears out of the
mist, wrapped in a filthy ki-
mono, twitching his massive
shoulders, his face encrusted
with dirt, sweat and whiskers,
carefully picking lice out of his
hair. He manages to look both
ferocious and intensely comic.
This, indeed, is the mood of YO-
JIMBO.

The violence of the film has
a whirlwind force, a physical
impact on the viewer, a kind
of savage, gleeful, blood-lust.
The humor is sharply ironic and
as incisive as a razor.

As a commentary on modern
man, YOJIMBO is devastating.
As entertainment, it is a spec-
tacle of raw action and intrigue
which the viewer will not easily
forget. Film Friends are look-
ing forward to showing it at Dav-
idson. It ‘will be shown Jan.
3 and 5.

The final Film Friends selec-
tion for this semester will be
Eisenstein’s famous IVAN THE

TERRIBLE, one of the last and j

possibly the greatest of the
famed Russian director’s films.
For second semester, Film
Friends plans an exapnded pro-
gram of great variety.

fs Cat 0
om Nine Tails

By MICHAEL L. HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Associste Editor

Once there was a rural tavern facing a little
country road and a single set of railroad tracks.
Not a fancy beer hall, just a small grocery with gas
pump, and it sold only the standard brands of domes-
tic beer inside its five concrete walls. The interior
was dingy and poorly lighted, its red plastic booths
torn and scarred with many cigarette burns. This
place should have made only a marginal living but it
stood just half a mile north of an all-men’s college.
Business was good.

So the country tavern saw many persons come
and go; an occasional farmer, a few truckers. a few
more vouths from the surrounding countryside, then
the college crowd. A sociologist would marvel at the
clear-cut layers of this piece of an American cake
— I saw more than diversities.

TOWNIES

The “townies”, as the non-college were labelled,
gulped their beer sometimes loudly, sometimes al-
most apologetically. Usually staring, half-cursing,
always envying the college crowd.

There were the freshmen. One short beer to
announce their masculinity and then a dance around
the room to celebrate their intoxication for anyone
bored enough to notice. Out of bleary eyes the
sophomores would nod wisely, then return to a sage
evaluation of their own awesome capacities. Every-
one ignored the townies.

Every so often a boy would come in alone and
drink alone. First short beers, then long ones, finally
a quart or two. Maybe he played a sad song or two
on the battered jukebox in the corner. It didn’t
really matter. Because soon he’d pull out a soiled
letter or grade report — read it once more or just
stare at the ceiling, slip out to his car or across to
the tracks. A loneliness and a very real fear.

SOPHISTICATES

There were the sophisticates and the cool boys.
These lordly Aryans sprawled out knowingly over the
booths, pretending to ignore everyone else. Yet
strange band often forgotten), but even one of this
breed would have that same expression of loneliness
and fear (sought so desperately to hide) steal into
his eyes. I knew that bewildered look.

Yes, and there were the flits. Nobody exactly
reads them out of the human race, but there has
always been that casual ierk of the head, that know-
ing smile placing a man beyond the pale of the good
guys. Sometimes the faces of these outcasts register-
ed the pain of this unnatural status, but often this
breed seemed to have a good time in spite of them-.
selves — much to the satisfaction of many uneasy
consciences.

The country tavern saw them all and its beer
pennants made no comment. The jukebox and the
cash register bleated out their passionate sounds. the
boys came and sometimes the men left. The lords
of the earth, the good guys, the flits, the townies.
And outside this dream world the sun shone, the
moon rose and fell. The trains lumbered through and
the highway roadbed kept watch.

WHO AM I?

But if a man would stand somewhere so that
his mind could take in the whole scene, all the faces
would blend into one very human face, the voices
into a single moment of silence. In the silence there
were the questions: “Who am I? Where am I? I'm
alone, too alone?”

The skies never split with the thundering of a
heavenly answer and still the beer cans clinked in
the trash barrel. But an answer was there and a man
could jpxperience this answer — even he could not
utter it.

We were one in our loneliness and in our love of
joy-in-life, divided only by ourselves into caste lines
of features and manners that crippled only the
dividers and intensified their own alienation. This
was that answer of the silence.

These dividers, these ones who would segregate,
only cut themselves off from the peace-in-life they
sought. If they would only see the oneness of men —
yet have men not always been blind? But could it
not be different! But then how?
