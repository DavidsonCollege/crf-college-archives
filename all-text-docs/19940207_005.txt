Campus police report an 80%
decrease in burglaries and a 46%
decrease in property loss since
1992. As crime rates around the
nation soar, those at Davidson con-
tinue to sink.

Assistant Director of Public
Safety and Police attributes the
decreases in burglaries and prop-
erty loss to the new card access
system and to crime prevention
programs.

Until last year dorms were
secured by a code system which
permitted doors to stay propped
open inviting unwanted visitors.
Police had no way of knowing
doors were left open unless they
happened to walk by. Prior to the
code system, dorms were not se-
cured at all.

With the new card access
system, non-Davidson students
cannot entera residential building
without being let in by a student.
’ [In addition, an alarm is sent to the
police dispatcher when a door has
been propped open, signaling po-
lice to close the door. Because
most crimes on campus are com-
mitted by non-students, reduced

Davidson crime rates down in 1993

access to buildings by non-students
has greatly reduced theft.

Davidson’s Crime Prevention
Officer, Sergeant Harding, has also
contributed to Davidson’s success
in decreasing crime. Harding is
responsible for holding seminars
and distributing crime prevention
literature, which often includes tips
and reminders for students.

The department’s push for bi-
cycle locks has lead to a decrease
in bicycle theft as well. Officer
Moore says, “Locked bikes used to
be the exception, but it is now
uncommon to see bikes unlocked
on campus.”

Davidson has had no Class I
offenses, which include homicide,
forcible robberies, aggravated as-
sault, and rape, in the last two
years. Moore reports that
“Davidson has always been fortu-
nate in the area of violent crimes.”

In addition to low crime rates,
Davidson police also reported high
Uniform Crime Reports clearance
rates for 1993. The department
must file a Uniform Crime Report
for every incident of crime. These
reports are “cleared” when the
department determines who com-

mitted the crimes. Davidson
cleared 44.5% of all offenses in
1992 and 73% in 1993 while North
Carolina cleared only 22.7% and
the nation as a whole cleared only
22.5% in 1992.

Clearing crimes at Davidson,
where the Campus Police have no
connection with the people off-
campus whom they deal with, can
be more difficult than in cities
where the police know the people.
Most city investigators have “in-
sides” and “snitches” that they
can go to for leads, but Davidson
Campus police do not have that
advantage. Moore attributes

Paper protests budget cuts
BIG RAPIDS, MICH. (CPS)—

Ferris State University published
a nearly blank edition to protest
budget cuts eliminating the
school’s journalism department.

The staff of the bi-weekly
paper, The Torch, published the
nearly blank edition late last year
to show students what the univer-
sity will be like without a journal-
ism program.

The 12-page edition con-
tained only two small cartoons
denouncing the cuts and an edito-
rial explaining the blank pages.

_ The paper’s opinion editor,
Ron Woycehoski, said the edi-
tion was published to express dis-
may about the university cutting
/37F million from its Budget by”
eliminating 17 academic pro-
grams.

According to Woycehoski,
the paper received criticism about
their action, but response from
students has been positive.

Newsletter offers support
BETHLEHEM, PA (CPS)—A
Lehigh University senior has de-
veloped an electronic newsletter
to help others affected with Lyme
disease.

Marc Gabriel was diagnosed
with the disease two years ago.
From his apartment in Bethlehem,
Pa., he started the newsletter to
help other Lyme disease patients
obtain information via modem.
Gabriel edits LYMENET, which
includes research findings and

news stories about the disease.
The newsletter is sent every couple

_of weeks to thousands of readers}

in eight countries.

Gabriel is currently building
National LYMENET, a bulletin
board, database and e-mail sys-
tem for the Lyme Disease Net-
work of New Jersey. When the
system is running, it will allow
users to access the latest informa-
tion about Lyme disease.

The acute inflammatory dis-
ease causes joint pain, arthritis,
heart and neurological disorders.
About 700,000 Americans are in-
fected with the disease. Half of
the patients suffering permanent|
disability are under the age of 12.

School holds world games
SEATTLE (CPS)—About 400
students got the chance to try to
resolve global problems when Se-
attle Pacific U. hosted The World
Game Workshops Jan. 18-19.

In the games, the world’s
population of 5 billion was con-
densed to a room full of players.
During the three-hour workshops,
participants were divided into
populations and placed on a 35-
foot-by-70-foot map of the Earth.

Different teams were charged
with the responsibility of solving
their areas’s problems. Other

teams were designated as the
United Nations, the World Bank,
the World Health Organization,
and the media. Problems that

various teams struggled with in-
cluded hunger, illiteracy, technol-
ogy, health and economics.

Davidson’s success in clearing

cases to hard work by his officers,
especially full-time investigator
Sergeant McLaurin.

Moore believes - that
Davidson could continue this
trend if students would take ad-
vantage of Sergeant Harding’s
seminars and remember toalways
secure their possessions. He en-
courages students to report suspi-
cious persons or incidents, add-
ing, “We’re always happy tocome
out- even if it turns out to be
nothing.”

ROTC prepares for spring semester

By Jeff Kent

As the spring term begins at
Davidson, the ROTC program
gears up for an exciting semester.
On April 1, the Davidson Reserve
Officers Training Core will cel-
ebrate the 75th anniversary of its
founding at this college.

In addition to that landmark
occasion, the ROTC will partici-
pate in several activities between
now and May. The first big event
will be the annual Military Ball at
Vail Commons. The ball will fea-
ture guest speaker, retired Lieu-
tenant General Walter F. Ulmer.

General Ulmer will address
the ROTC cadets and the Depart-
ment of Military Studies faculty,
sharing experiences and knowl-
edge from his 33-year military ca-
reer. Since his retirement in 1985,
General Ulmer has acted as the
President and Chief Executive Of-
ficer for the Center for Creative

Leadership, a nonprofit organiza-
tion working toward behavioral
science research, executive devel-
opment, and leadership education.

In his presentation, General
Ulmer will undoubtedly touch on
the issues of leadership and
achievement, both inside and out-
side the military.

The following weekend,
ROTC members will engage in the
Winter Field Training Exercise.
The FTX, as the exercises are called
by ROTC officers and cadets, are
the only field training held at
Davidson.

Major Michael Hawkins, from
Davidson’s ROTC, explains that
the exercises are designed to pre-
pare junior ROTC members for a
required six week camp at Fort
Bragg. According to Hawkins,
this camp is crucial for determin-
ing the new officers’ placement in
the Army after they graduate, as

well as whether or not they will
receive active duty.

The Fort Bragg camp stresses,
“demonstrating expertise in mili-
tary skills and leadership ability.”
Consequently, the Davidson FTX
centers around activities that will
improve these skills.

Although the exercises are
designed to prepare the junior
members, other ROTC students
also participate, with the seniors
organizing the event, and the fresh-
men and sophomores acting as
“opposing forces.”

Correction am

In the Jan. 31 article "What are
you getting for your board bill
money?" we printed errone-
ously that Phi Delta Theta
charges its members $1200 for
5 meals a week. Phi Delt is
actually the court's cheapest

house, charging only $550 for
10 meals a week.
