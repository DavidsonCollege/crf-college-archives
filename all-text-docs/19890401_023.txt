*&&k*& THE DAVIDSONIAN’S 751H Anniversary Issue x %& %& April 1989

The Eighties: stability

The 1980's brought stability
to Davidson after the turbu-
lent 60’s and 70’s. Women
became firmly cemented on
the campus in numbers and
influence. After President
Sam Spencer's surprise
resignation and a one year
search, John Kuykendall was
plucked from Auburn Univer-
sity’s religion department to
head Davidson, and he was
installed at the 1984 Fall
Convocation.

Physical changes to
Davidson include the comple-
tion of Vail Commons in 1984
and the groundbreaking of
the Baker Sports Complex
that will replace Johnston
Gym. Six new dorms ap-
peared in the 1980's: Irwin,
Akers and Knox dormitories
and, more recently, the three
as yet unnamed apartment
buildings adjacent to Coving-
ton Golf Course.

Academically speaking, the
faculty voted twice to change
the calendar, once reversing
itself in*1983 and finally
switching the college to a

Exeerp

semester system from the
trimester plan for the 1988-89
school year. Davidson en-
joyed a growing reputation
for excellence in the 1980's

_and was ranked as high as

ninth in U.S. News and World
Report's study of national
liberal arts colleges.

‘While these changes have
affected and will continue to
affect Davidson College, the
80’s revealed to contain a

great deal of turbulence in
terms of the leisure time of
the community. The frater-

The automatic bid: how
sweet it was to have the op-
portunity to win the Southern
Conference tournament and
qualify for the NCAA. The
Wildcats hadn’t been there
since 1970, which was during
the first year of the Terry
Holland era, and now they
were going back.

It was March of 1986 and
Davidson was having its most
successful season under fifth
year head coach Bobby
Hussey. The Cats finished
the regular season 10-6 in the
Conference and 17-10
overall.

December 10, 1982 excerpt from
an article by David Resnik:

The Town Police have
killed squirrels since they
began ht in early
November. The Campus
police killed 62 eauirels over

Many residents ate the dead
squirrels, and the town police
froze the leftovers for later -
consumption: The Campus
police gave their dead squir-
rels to many of the janitors

and maintenance men. “What

was killed, was eaten,” said
Captain Hughes.

ed houses, Emanon was- ~
going strong. Up until 1982,
there was a waiting list to get
in,. But now for some reason,
people are‘heading back to
the frats and single-sex
houses. Since the admini-
stration doesn’t allow purely
social houses on the Court, it
looks like this spring will be
Emanon’s last term.”

team 71-62. The Keydets had

Davidson faced East Tennes-

yesterday; the faculty over-
whelmingly voted to remain
on trimesters. Many of you
may feel that this whole

’ ordeal was.a waste of time
and are glad it’s over. Even -
though considering semesters
resulted in no real action, it

was useful because it allowed 7

the school to reconsider its
educational policies.

March 20, 1987 excerpt from
Betsy Bryan's article on
Emanon'’s closing:

A lack of members will
force Emanon, one of
Davidson's two remaining co-
ed eating houses, to close
completely next fall; however,
a successful fundraiser at the -
end of the winter term will
allow Emanon to remain
as a social house forthe  _
remainder of spring term.

(President) Stephens
attributes the decrease in
membership to a change in
the social atmosphere at
Davidson. “The houses on
