Ballard Defies "Cowardly Acts"

Hang in There Dr.
Kuykendall

It is rare for students at any level of schooling to admire,
even revere, administrators. Even rarer is an administrator who
can be equally respected by faculty, students and alumni. But
John Kuykendall is such a man.

As he enters the ninth year of his presidency at Davidson,
Kuykendall has led our charge from a school of regional
recognition to one that shines nationally. He has overseen a
decade of unprecedented change and growth. From major
physical improvements, such as the Visual Arts Center and
Baker Sports Complex, to significant campus environmental
changes, like the alcohol policy; Kuykendall has directed a
period of tremendous transformation at Davidson.

In a recent interview with The Davidsonian, Kuykendall
hints at his future here. He mentions his concerns of becoming
“stale” in his position and worries about the maintenance of
fresh leadership for the college’s best interests. Rumors of
Kuykendall’s eventual departure and potential replacements
have been commonplace over the past few years. Itis our wish
to encourage President Kuykendall to “hang in there.” His
leadership has been the major impetus for the positive moves
at Davidson and he is the ideal individual to continue the
school’s developmental course. |

Kuykendall states that “If excellence is good enough for

today it is not good enough for tomorrow.” Well, Kuykendall’s

brand.of excellence has been good enough and we would like .

to see it continue for many more tomorrows.

To the Editor,

On Monday, January
18th, I arrived at my office
and found that the small
poster on my door had been
defaced with a racial slur.
The poster, designed tocheer
passers-by, depicts three
Zimbabwean women danc-
ing and singing above acap-
tion that reads: “If you can
walk you can dance; if you
can talk you can sing.” The
person or persons respon-
sible wrote: “If you can
bounce a ball, you can play
basketball,” andconsciously
or unconsciously they had

chosen Martin Luther King’s
birthday to express their ani-
mosity.

Some may suggest that
this was a meaningles inci-
dent, or that the intentions of
the person who did this can-
not be inferred. Ugliness,
like beauty is in the eye of
the beholder or in that of the
recipient of the deed. To me
itis a reflection of the ongo-
ing assault to the spirit with
which students, faculty, and
staff of color must contend
every day.

Ne news is not good

news. Silence on the part of

. those who have been

wounded may only be an
indication that they have
given up. There are many
standards for measuring ex-
cellence. Moral excellence
is the most important of all,
and cowardly acts of spiri-
tual violence can pollute a
whole community. As a
community we must con-
tinue to work for positive
changes: in attitudes toward
people who are different
from ourselves.

McLaurin: Come Get Your Bike

To the Editor,
During the summer
break as well as Christmas

picked up many non-regis-
tered bicycles around cam-

-| pus for safe keeping. Unfor-
tunately, very few students —

break the Campus Police

have come by our office to
claim their bikes. If you are
missing a bicycle, please
come by our office and look
at the bicycles that we have
in storage, one of them may
be yours. Please be aware of
the fact that any property

left in storage longer than
six months is subject to be
soldatauction. Please come
by and claim your bicycle
before this happens to you.
Thank you,
Sgt.D.E. McLaurin

Spivey, Humphrey Write On Exams

To the Editor,

Students, check. your
syllabi now! The rule at
Davidson is that no papers
or tests may be assigned the
week before optional class
days if a final exam is re-
quired in that class. If you
find that your professor has
scheduled a test or paper
during this time, you have

the rightto point out this rule
to them. When students are
completing work for a pro-
fessor down tothe last writer,
their time to study forexams
is reduced. Some exams
count for a large percentage
of the final grade in a class,
and it is not fair to have 15
weeks worth of work com-
prised because of inadequate

time to prepare for the exam.
Students, be aware that you
don’t have to be writing pa-
pers or taking tests the weck
before optional class days,
and you can’do something
about it if you catch it now.
