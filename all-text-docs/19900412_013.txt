ten days, in what was probably their

ponents.

They began on March 28 by trav-
elling to Boone to play the Mountain-
eers of Appalachian State. Despite
relatively solid pitching from junior
Dave Williams (7 innings, 3 runs, 11
hits), the ‘Cats were only able toreach
base on six singles, which produced
just two runs. The final tally was 5-2.

If you missed the April 1 double-

_ header against the 20th ranked Citadel

trap onthe 3rd hole of the Covington
Golf Facility, gave Davidson a 7-5
lead as they headed to the final frame.
It looked as if the case was closed
when Twombly got the first two outs
of the inning. Unfortunately, the Bull-
dogs proceeded to rap out four con-
secutive hits to tie the game.

On Friday, Davidson travelled to

for the second time this season. Duke
won the first game at Davidson by the
score of 2-0, but, in keeping with the
recent offensive tradition, Duke and
Davidson also combined for 29 hits

Struggles

By ROBERT GRUBB

Saturday, March 31 wasn’t a
complete loss for the men’s tennis
team; at least they didn’t miss the
NCAA basketball Final Four on tele-
vision. After being swept 6-0 in singles
by the Buccaneers of East Tennessee
State, the team opted not to play the
doubles. Said coach Jeff Frank, “We
were forced to play inside, and their
indoor courts are really poor, so we
decided to get back in the vans and get
back home and watch the basketball.”

The team also suffered a tough
loss last week at the hands of Wake
Forest. Only Albie Varoski managed
to win for the Wildcats, who lost over-
all 5-1 in singles. Varoski, who has
been playing well lately, also lost a
close two-set match against ETSU.
Charles Jordan and Kurtis Zabell also
tured in strong performances against
the Bucs.

__ Frankseemed a bitconcerned with
the play of the team, since two weeks
of crucial matches loomed on the hori-
zon. “The matches acon UNCC and

nexttwo forwecks will snk or beak our
season record.”

Unfortunately, the three UNC
schools scored a hat trick over the
‘Cats. The three defeats put hopes for
a 17th consecutive winning season in
serious jeopardy.

UNC-G defeated Davidson 5-3 in
a close match, winning the deciding
match at #1 doubles in a third set
tiebreaker. The Davidson team allowed

Reet

theiropponents to get back in the match
by giving upconsecutive service breaks
in the third set.

Nonetheless, coach Jeff Frank was
not as disappointed with the doubles
play as he.was with the poor singles
play. “The singles didn’t play as well
as I thought they were capable of play-
ing,” said Frank. “As aresult, we didn’t
enter the doubles in the position we
had hoped.”

Frank’s disappointment with the
singles play continued against UNCC.
“T think that some of the guys are in a
slump that they will be able to play out
of,” commented Frank. ““The doubles
were a bright spot though.”

Frank used some new doubles
combinations against UNC-Chapel
Hillinan effort to set the ship straight.
But Carolina, which has been ranked
among thenation’s top25 teams, turned
outnot to be the place for the Wildcats
to pull outof their slump. Albie Varoski
and Dale Voeks teamed up to win five
straight games in the second set to.
clinch the only victory in an 8-1 loss.

Frank , in planning his lineup for
the end of this season, is looking ahead

_AO-Next. season..“If Albie-and Dale

“they could be a
possible combination for next year, in
addition to Kurtis Zabell and John
Beyer, who have played together for
two years,” he said. “I also hope.to get

some of the singles players out of their

slumps before the season-ending tour-

nament.””

The scheduled match against Pfeif-
fer has been moved to next week. The
Wildcats’ only action of this week will
be on Thursday at Elon.

Bruce Balestier / On the Sports Front

Bulldogs, you missed what were ar-
guably the two besthome games of the
year, CR nse,
Game one was aclassic pitchers’
duel, as the Wildcats sent unbeaten
senior Greg Wilcox to face the Cita-
del’s #1 hurler. Through threeinnings,
both pitchers held the opposition score-
less, and Wilcox had faced the mini-
mum nine batters. But Wilcox unrav-
eled a bit in the fourth, when two
Bulldogs found their way home. The
Wildcats responded by manufacturing
arun in their half of the fourth. Center
fielder Ron Krnacik got things rolling
with a leadoff triple, and a passed ball
brought him streaking home tocut the
deficit to 2-1.

Unfortunately, that’s the way the
game ended. Wilcox shut down the
Bulldogs the rest of the way, but
Davidson's offensive fireworks never
materialized, despite placing the lead-
off hitter on base in four of the seven
innings, Wilcox thus suffered his first
defeat of the 1990 campaign.

Dave Williams gotthestart in game
two, but coach Stoeckel had seen
enough by the middle of the fourth. By
that time, the Citadel possessed a 5-3
lead, and were threatening to add to it.
He went to Derek Twombly, the 65"

and were subsequently removed from
the stands. When the rain delay ended,
Davidson had arunner on first with no
outs. As each successive batter strode
to the plate, the “Cats edged closer to
victory until, finally, with two outs,
the bases were loaded for freshman
shortstop Rob Eenhoorn. The fresh-
man coolly stepped to the plate and
slapped an infield single to propel
Davidson to an 8-7 victory.

The game against Wake Forest
April 3 was another hitter’s dream; 29
hits and 18 runs jumped off the bats of
both teams. Ron Krnacik (3 for 5),
Mikio Aoki (3 for 5) and DH Joe
Azzolino (2 for 3,3 runs, 2 RBI, 1 HR)
paced the Wildcats offensively. But it
wasn’t enough. Four Davidson pitch-
ers were unable to contain the Dia-
mond Deacon bats, and the ‘Cats fell
11-7.

*

April 4, the 12th ranked North
Carolina Tar Heels came to town. The
Wildcats were thirsty for their third
triumph over a nationally ranked team.
Eenhoorn started things off nicely by
leading off the game with a homer for
the fourth time this season. When the
‘Cats pushed another run across in the

mound, the score was still tied at eight
after six innings. But an unearned run
in the seventh and an insurance run in
the ninth gave Davidson a 10-8 vic-
tory. Shortstop Rob Eenhoornand right
fielder Rick Bender both went 4 for 5.
Bender, Pete Hughes and Mac
Chapman provided support for the
‘Cats.

In Sunday’s doubleheader against
North Carolina A&T, Davidson faced

~ayoung and inexperienced team. Dave

Williams got the start in game one, and
notched his fifth victory of the season
by pitching a four-hit, ten strikeout
complete game. The 3-0 win was his
third shutout of the season.

Game two was a tight 6-5 ball
game until the Wildcats opened. it up
with an eight run sixth inning. Derek
Twombly picked up the win in relief,
and Brad Wanzenburg got his second
save of the year. The sweep gave
Davidson a 19-18-1 record with 14
games to play.

Tuesday’s game at Wake Forest
was postponed due to rain. The ‘Cats
play at Lenoir-Rhyne Wednesday and
travel toN.C. A&T to meet the Aggies
in a twinbill on Saturday.

On Musberger and

Davidson

Last Monday evening’s NCAA
basketball championship game, which
saw Nevada-Las Vegas crush Duke,
103-73, was the last event for Brent
Musberger as a broadcaster for CBS
Sports, and I cannot even express my
extreme and utter joy at his departure.
Musberger had become a fixture at
CBS, heading their coverage of the
Super Bowl, “the NFL Today,” the
Masters, the NBA Finals and the U.S.
Open tennis tournament. He seemed
the prime candidate, as well, to head
CBS coverage of major league base-
ball, which begins this month.

CBS and Musberger had been in
the midst of contract negotiations be-
fore CBS’ announcement Sunday that
the championship game would be the
veteran announcer'’s final assignment
for thenetwork. It appears, at this time,
that Musberger’s demand for high-
profile assignments brought on the
move, but you know what they say:
Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.
Any reason suffices, as far as I’m
concemed,

Forme, Musberger’s tenure atCBS
was marked by the tendency to substi-
tute inane and irrelevant commentary
in place of any kind of useful or perti-
nentremarks about the particular con-
test he was covering. Musberger pos-
sesses only passable knowledge, at
best, about the sports he covers, and
contributes only drivel where insight-
ful commentary is anecessity. Itis my
sincere hope that no other network
picks him up; the viewing public has
suffered enough.

Meanwhile, closer to home, it’s
official; padding has arrived and has
been installed on the upper intramural
courts in the Baker Sports Complex.
Wenow may utilize them toour hearts’
content, with the security of mind that
accompanies a stringent standard of
safety.

tational Racquetball Tournament, held
March 31 in Baker Sports Complex,
