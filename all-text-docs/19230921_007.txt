THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 23, 1923

Former classmates and friends of
Rey. J. G. Patton, °16, will be glad to
learn that he has recently been installed
as pastor of the Pryor Street Presbyte-
rian Church, Atlanta, Ga.

Since graduating from Davidson,
Mr. Patton spent two years in the

army as a lieutenant, and then finished |

his seminary course at Union Semi-
nary. His first charge was at Law-
renceville, Ga., where he did a wonder-
ful work. He and Mrs. Patton by
their untiring efforts built up the Sun-
day School tremendously, and estab-
lished the graded Sunday School
system. Mr. Patton also established
the every member canvass as a system
for financing the church, and increased
the membership of the church over 50
per cent,

Mr. Patton is probably one of the
best preachers among the younger min-
isters of the church, and his countless
friends are glad to see him succeeding
so well in his chosen work.

Members. ofthe Class of ’23 on the
Hill for the opening were Bob Mc-
Leod, Tally Elliott, Johnny Adams,
Sam Davis, Pat Crawford, Snag Bailey
and Harold Covington.

J. B. Bryan, a member of last year’s
Freshman class, spent a few days on
the Hill en route to Charlottesville,
Va., where he will enter U. of Va. as
a student this year.

Preston B. Carwile, ‘20, was united
in marriage on September 4th, at Ches-
ter, Va,, to Miss Lois Corinne
Ketcham.

Mr. John James, '08, has established
law offices in Charlotte, N. C.

Members of the Class of ’23 will be
interested to learn of the marriage of
R. E. Sydenstricker and Miss. Eliza-
beth Bell, at Lewisburg, W. Va., on
August 15th.

CLASSMATES OF 1893 GATHER
FOR REUNION

One of the livest features of the
1923 Commencement at Davidson was
the reunion of the members of the
Class of 1893, celebrating the thirtieth

anniversary of their graduation,

In many ways the Class of 1893 is
the most remarkable class that ever
graduated from Davidson, Oldtimers
remember it as the noisiest class that
lived on the campus. It had class
spirit, pep and enthusiasm surpassing
any and all other classes. It was un-
der the leadership of members of this
class that Davidson heard its first col-
lege yell. The class of '93 was the
first class. in the history of Davidson

back to celebrate its fifth anniversary,
but which was so completely over-
shadowed by the Class of 93 that they
were scarcely noticeable, passed reso-
lutions determining to follow the spirit
jof °93.

The most beautiful part of 93's ¢ele-
bratien, however, was not observed by
ithe piblic in general. That was the
[beautifully appointed class | dinner
given the members by Dr. and Mrs, T.
|W. Lihgle,at their home Tuesday

and W. I. Knox, The discussion of
timely topics drifted from one end of
the cvcle to the other, and there was
a difference of opinion on a great
many subjects, such as “The problem
of teaching High School Girls ;” “The
Easiest Way to Get an M.D. Degree ;”
“When a trick play should be used in
football,” ete. But there was an agree-
ment on one subject, and that was “Da-
vidson,”

When the name of Davidson was
mentioned there was a silence born of
reverence, and for a moment there was
a light in the eve of every ‘22 man as-
sembled there in that little band, that
spoke of something inexprssible; a love
that means gratitude for a service ren-
dered, And then ‘22 pledged anew her
loyalty to Alma Mater in those words
that bring tears to the eves of strong
men:

When our college days are over,
And our ways shall part,

Still to thee we'll be united,
Still be one at heart.

*22 has already begun to make plans
for a reunion in ‘27 that will long be
remembered, With four years to plan
for it it should be a success.

Commencement was a great success
and was enjoyed by every member of
the class. low us to pay a tribute to
‘23 and her class president, Bascomb
Sorrells. You deserve credit for the
splendid exercises and our best wishes

The man who deals in the un-
expected, who meusures the pos-
sibility of the unexpected striking

uation. Of its 20 graduates 15 of them
entered the ministry, a percentage per-
haps never equalled by any other class.
Of its 20 graduates, three are today
full-fledged professors at Davidson—
Dr. T. W. Lingle, Dr. J. L. Douglas,
and Dr. J. M. Douglas. Possibly no
other class in the history of Davidson
has given back to its alma mater such
a large percentage of its membership.
In addition to these professors, the
Class of 1923 has given Rev. W. M.
Hunter to the financial department of
the college. Thus four of its 20 grad-
uates are today connected with the
college.

These, and other items too numerous
to mention, justify the statement that
93 is probably the most remarkable
class ever graduated at Davidson.

03 was expected to live up to its
reputation when the members, 11 of
them; met on the campus Tuesday,
June 5, 1923, and began their celebra-
tion. And they did. They startled the
banqueters at the Alumni Banquet
when they cut loose with their class
song and class yell.

But the real celebration came after

liest feature on the campus during
Commencement. Under the leadership
of Prof. J. L. Douglas, with cane in
hand, decorated with his hat, they sang
class and college songs; yells, danced,
howled, and in other lively ways show-
ed they still had the pep. So worthy
was their example of college and class
spirit that the Class of 718, which was

on, you alumni, put some pep into your

you good, and it will boost dear old
Davidson.

MANY MEMBERS OF ’22
ATTEND COMMENCEMENT

As usual, '22 cannot let this issue of
the Davidsonian go to press without in-
forming you of the fact that she was
present for Commencement.

In the heart of every alumnus there

‘\is that desire to drift back to the old

campus and see the changes that have
been made. Whether ’22 was prompt-
ed by this desire or the desire to show
to the student body that she could do

|such a thing after facing the world for

a year we cannot say, but we do say
that ’22 was present, not in full num-
bers, but in enough to call it a class
at least.

No formal class meeting was held,
but we enjoyed being together: in an
informal way and talking over our ex-
periences. They were many and varied
and naturally so with such an array of
professo:s, students, coaches and busi-
ness men, along with Chef McAlpine

year, we wish to give another message.
There is always room. for improve-
ment. You have. seen Davidson go
through some great changes and as: the
old order changeth, giving place to the
new, be warned by the mistakes others
have made before you and may you
improve the conditions on the campus
this year as much as they have been
improved in recent ‘years.

We thank the management of the
“livest wite on the Hill” for the privi-
lege of these remarks. This article
would not be complete without telling
you that we are behind you 100. per
cent, and we are for Davidson first,
last and always.

you and who protects you against
the unexpected, is the reliable in-
surance agent.
