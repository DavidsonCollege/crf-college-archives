A Davidsonian Sports Analysis

Basketball Recovery Requires Desire

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

There was a tradition founded
in Davidson athletics by a man
named Charles E. Dreisell a
few years ago. It concerned
basketball...winning _— basket-

ball.
Today, that mystique seems

to be slowly fading away.

For this reason, it is ap-
propriate to pause in the midst
of a weary time with a 4-13
record to consider whether or
not Davidson College can ever
rise to its former position a-
mong the powers of the colle-
giate basketball ranks.

Davidson head coach Bo
Brickels, in his usually op-
timistic tone, emphatically af-
firmed the concerns implied in
the above statement. ‘‘I don’t
think the question is whether or
not we can ever regain our
position,’’ he said. ‘“‘Of course
we can. We just have to con-
sider what it will take to get us
there again.

“Before Lefty went to
Maryland, he had put us at the
top as far as national prominen-
ce was concerned. Then we
moved to a middle position
where we were a winner, but
not a power. Now we have lap-
sed into the lower segment. So it
is not just a question of moving
from the middle to the top as it
was a year or two ago. It is a
matter of going all the way
from the bottom to the top.”’

Indeed, the road ahead cer-
tainly looks long. Turning to the
method of attaining these goals,
Brickels emphasized that the
lack of success this season rests
on what he termed over expec-
tation.

“T guess I was just blindly op-
timistic. Sure the schedule is
tough, and most of the teams we
play are road games. But I
think one of the most significant
reasons for our failure thus far
has been that I have expected
too much from the players.
When this happens and you lose
to'some real good teams, there

tends to be a loss of confidence.
I think this is what has hap-
pened and it certainly seems to
be my fault because I just ex-
pected to much.”

Having set the record straight
as far as the lack of success this
season, Brickels moved on to
point out the first key element
necessary to bring Davidson
back to the top in national
prominence.

“We have got to start winning
the Southern Conference Tour-
nament again,” he commented.

To make a point of how
strongly he felt about the tour-
ney crown, Brickels said that he
would trade the 18- and 19-win
seasons of the past few years

for the record he has now, if he
could have the tourney title with
it.

“It means that much.
Because one ‘of the things a
player really cares about when
you go out to recruit him is
where you were in March. So
you can imagine how valuable it
would be to say that we can con-
ceivably get into the NCAA
Tournament every year. A few
years ago, we could say that,
now we can’t, and it is a big fac-
tor.”’

Since recruiting is probably
the largest single factor in
determining whether or not
Davidson can return to its for-
mer greatness,’ Brickels
outlined the current situation .

“Of course we are at a disad-

aspects of the program,
Brickels made a point in favor
of the way things were now
being handled.

“There was a transition
period which began when Lefty
moved. At that same time,
other coaches moved to schools
like Clemson, Furman, etc.
Those. schools started making
things happen. We didn’t move
with them,

“T did not feel that the school
was making the necessary com-
mitment to basketball at that
time. The consequences are
being felt now. But the situation
has changed. At this point I can
truthfully say that we are
receiving the commitment of
the college for the basketball
program. That will certainly be
important as we strive to regain
our past position.”

So now the recruiting
problem centers on something
which is more intangible than
academics or finances. Brickels
explained it in this manner.

“There are three steps to be seo

considered when you try and

activities to be associated

with a good academic in-
stitution.

that many if not most myu
school’s players do not know
about academic reputations.
One means just about as much
as another. Podunk U. sounds
just as good as Davidson from

“But one problem is
life on this campus. And that
makes it hard to sell the school
to a prospect, when he may feel
he has to go to another town
and/or another school to have
any fun on the weekend.

“Of course we can assure
him that the size of the student
body means that he will get to
know most of the people. And he

“will become friends with some
professors. But that is not as
true as some would lead you to
believe.”

The recruiting problems
become more apparent as they
are considered on an individual
basis. Certainly there is a great
deal of hard work involved in
getting good basketball players
to Davidson. ‘But Brickels ap-
pears ready to put the effort in.

“The coaches know what has
to be done,’’ he explained. We
have already been in contact
with more players than ever
before. The job is there. We just
have to do it.”

The question of whether or
not Davidson can rise to
national prominence again is
answered in one word by Bo
Brickels. . . yes.

The key point which must be
remembered is that it took five
years or so to fall from the top
level to the present status in
which the program finds itself.
Brickels wants to be sure that

ple are willing to wait that
ong or at least longer than a
year or two before they expect
to be ranked in the country’s top
five.

truly concerned about academ-
ics. In that respect, we don,t

“Then we have to seli tne

fact that this year will present
a problem because of our
record. Other than that, though,
you have to show the prospect
that we can win, that we can get
to the NCAA, and perhaps most
importantly, that he will have
an opportunity to play. It will be

vantage to start with. The
requirements for Davidson and
the academic environment
limit us to about one-tenth of the
possible candidates that a
school such as UNC, N.C. State
and our opponents in the
Southern Conference can talk
to.

“But the academics are not a
barrier which makes it im-
possible for us to get back to the
top. It is just something we have
to live with and work with to
make the program go. I cer-
tainly would not blame the
academic standards of the
college for the problems we
have had this season.”’
