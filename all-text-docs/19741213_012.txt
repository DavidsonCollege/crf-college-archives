scorers with 26 points before
fouling out with 7:34 in the
game.

The Wildcats continued to
laden themselves with. tur-
nov This, combined with
an OSU shooting spree, con-
tributed to Ohio State’s
domination of the game in the
first half. The buzzer saw Ohio
leave the court with a 48-35 ad-
vantage.

The early part of the second
half saw the Wildcats’ efforts
to catch up _ repeatedly
frustrated. Davidson pulled to
within 7 points, 53-46 with
A$:24 remaining, only to fall to
a 15 point disadvantage. two
minutes later.

Head Coach Bo Brickels
praised highly the attitude of
his players at that point. ‘‘The
character of our people is all-
important. No one quit when
we kept getting behind. Ine
stead of giving up, the team
worked harder and went on to
win. I.can’t emphasize the im-

of this type of spir-
it,” Bricke]s stated.

Jay Powell , Greg Dunn and
Larry Horowitz sparked the
Wildcat rampage that over-
came the point difference. In
the last 13 minutes Davidson
outscored OSU 41-18. Of-
fensively the Wildcats clicked,
and Ohio St. assumed the role
of being foul-prone.

Dunn and Horowitz played
steady, aggressive ball while

Powell went on a_ scoring
spree that saw him make 16 of
his 20 points. In less than a
minute, a 10 point OSU ad-
vantage was cut to oné, 71-70,
and soon Horowitz put the
Cats on top, 74-73. Powell gave
Davidson the lead for good, 76-
74, with 4:52 left in the game.
Ohio St. tied the game once
and pulled to within one
another time, but Powell iced
the game on a int
play, and the Wildcats hung on
to win, 88-80.

Dunn connected for 22
points, and Horowitz, with 25
points, was voted Southern
Conference Player of the»
Week. The primary statistical
difference was in the free-
throw figures. Davidson hit on
26 of 32 trips to the line; OSU
made 12 of 19.

Brickels had praise for
more than just his team, “I
thought our students were
super. We had a huge turnout,
higher than any last year, and
this is a large factor in basket-
ball,” he said.

Brickels indicated that the
Wildcat game plans are still in
a state of flux. ‘‘We were a lit-
tle tight against Wofford. We
didn’t move the ball enough on
offense to get the good shots.

* So, now we’ll concentrate

on a tight defense; we are

going to get tougher, get more
tense,” Brickels promised.
