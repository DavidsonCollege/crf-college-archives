"Tue DAvIDSONIAN

Was it the accordion or the bagpipes in the
stands that caught the Wolfpack off-guard?
Or maybe it was the horns and the coin rattle?

But it was most likely the hard-working
defense of the Davidson Wildcats (3-1) that
caused the shut out Saturday afternoon on the
old Varsity Soccer Field.

The Wolfpack got off to a good start by
creating a couple of good opportunities to get
on the scoreboard. But the Davidson defense
wasn’t passing out free goals on this hot
September day.
The aggressive
Wildcat de-
fense continued
to deny the Pack
and helped to
create their own
opportunities
up top throughout the first half.

Until finally, in the thirty-fifth minute,
Catie Williams ‘04 saw the opportunity of the
game. After becoming trapped in crowded
territory in front of the goal, she touched the
ball back to a waiting Deneille Erikson ‘04.
Erikson proceeded to break through the Pack
defense and at the last second let off a shot
that was so powerful it sent the NC State
goalkeeper along with the ball into the back
of the net. Not only did Erikson grab her first
collegiate goal and the game winner, she also
shattered Wolfpack goalkeeper Kristen

Skinner’s 340 minute and 11 second shutout
streak.

The second half saw a persistent State team
determined to get the equalizer or better yet,
the win. The Wolfpack took eleven of their
sixteen shots in the sec-

the top of the box midway through the half
that was intercepted by 4 thick-skinned
Davidson defensive wall. And after an over-
zealous State player tackled Davidson’s Leigh
Anne Hoskins ’04 from behind as she ap-

proached the. goal, a

ond half, prompting
goalkeeper Winnie
Corrigan ’01 to have
‘five of her six saves in
the second half in re-

sponse. Corrigan’s

leadership by example

kept the determined

Davidson team going

throughout a rough.
half of play.

The crowd got into
it as it began to seem
that the players on the
field spent more time
on the ground than
they did with the ball.
Much of the jersey
tugging and hooking
went urmoticed by the
referee who was heck-
led by State and Cats
fans alike. Each team
had big opportunities
in the second half asa
result of the “unnec-
essary roughness.”

NC State was
awarded a free kick at

“Tt is only a stepping stone to-
wards the more difficult games on
our schedule.”

Winnie Corrigan

penalty kick was
awarded in the eighty-
second minute.
Carolyn Stumpf ’02
took the kick for
Davidson, which sailed
just wide of the right
goalpost.

But the rough play
didn’t seem to bother
Tara Maloney ’03, who
described it to be “busi-
ness as usual.” “In a
game when you can’t
always expect the ref
to blow his whistle,”
said Maloney, “you
have to learn to hold
your own and not get
frustrated.”

The last eight min-
utes were just as in-
tense as the previous
eighty-two. After
Wednesday night’s last
minute goal against

. Charlotte, the Cats
were prepared for a
possible overtime

Corrigan keeps ‘Cats alive in 1-0 victory over Pack —

battle for the win. Yet Corrigan and her

‘defense were not about to allow that to be a

possibility. They continued to reject the
Wolfpack’s advances until the final horn (or
bagpipes) sounded. And the Cats held on for
their third shutout of the season.

Senior co-captain Corrigan was excited
about the win, but continues to stay focused
on the big picture for the season. ’’We came
out and did what we needed to do to win a
game that we should have won,” says
Corrigan. “We’re pleased with the win but it
is only a stepping stone towards the more
difficult games on our schedule.”

Hard work and heart appeared to be the
theme of this game. Along with Corrigan,
upperclassmen like Sarah Falconi ‘01, Natalie
Cox ’02, and Penn Graves ’02 remembered
the 2-0 loss to NC State last year and were
determined to erase it. The sophomore
Maloney twins, Heather and Tara, continued
to break through the opposition’s defense
with their brilliant crosses. and fancy foot-
work. “A lot of players contributed to this
encouraging win over an ACC team,” said
Meghan Estes ‘03.

In the NC State game summary, Pack head
coach Laura Kerrigan was quoted as saying,
“We outplayed them and outshot them...”
Indeed the stats show that the Wolfpack did
outshoot the Wildcats on Saturday afternoon,
but it was pretty apparent.which team had the
bigger heart.

Women’s soccer comeback thwarted by 49ers OT goal

A chill was in the air. Maybe it was an
augur of the type of game that would follow.
On Wednesday evening, the cross-county
rivalry between the Wildcats of Davidson
College, who entered with a 3-0 record, and
the 49ers of
Charlotte, who
stood at 2-2, re-
sumed its feroc-
ity under the
lights of
Richardson Sta-
‘dium. Some
250 fans were

on hand to watch the annual game that has
been fueling the. rivalry for the past seven

Mike Anderson

A second-half rally was not cf

enough to give the Wildcats a

years. Although the Wildcats had the home
field advantage, the 49ers held aconsiderable
edge in the series at 6-0-1. But with the Cats
being 3-0 for the first time in team history,
they came out; more prepared than ever to
force the upset.

Charlotte started the game off with two
early goals to take the lead 2-0. Charlotte’s
Jill Currie, the Conference-USA’s reigning
Player of the Year, netted the first goal of the

evening at the four minute mark off of a.

deflection from junior Dawn Geyer. Fresh-
men Kim Moore followed just five minutes
later in a circus spectacle of sorts off a Char-
lotte corner kick. Mikel Casey headed the
ball to Kim Moore, who headed it into the
back of the net.

Yet the Davidson women were not content
to go into the locker room, down two goals, at
the half. “We all knew that we just needed
one goal to get some momentum going,” said
Leigh Anne Hoskins ‘04.

And with that heart and an Amy Johnston
’03 free kick from thirty yards out, the Wild-
cats were back in the game. Luckily, Hoskins
was on the end of that free kick and was
drawn like a magnet into the back of the goal.
The Charlotte keeper Jennifer Howell at-
tempted to beat Hoskins but was left only
with the taste of Smith Field in her mouth.
Hoskins jumped over the reaching keeper to
dribble the ball into the goal. And Charlotte
held only a one goal lead going into halftime.

The second half was a battle to the very

end. Even after the drizzle and the wind
started to pick up, the Wildcats and their fans
held on for the equalizer. Senior co-captain
and starting goalkeeper Winnie Corrigan was
there to make two huge saves when the team
needed then the most. And with less than 2

minutes remaining in the game, Heather

Maloney ’03 broke through heavy Charlotte
traffic to flick the ball on to an open Hoskins.
Once again, Hoskins placed a shot in the goal
past the keeper, only this time in the upper 90
out of her reach.

But the finish belonged to Charlotte. Six
minutes into the fifteen minute “sudden death”
overtime Charlotte’s Meredith Mayo took a
hard shot from the top of the box that hit the
crossbar like a rocket. Amidst heavy move-
ment in the goal box, 49er freshman forward
Jill Hayes managed to find the rebound and

net the game winner. The final score had -

In a rough game fueled by the passion of a
great rivalry, the numbers show just how
close it really was. Charlotte took 17 shots
while Davidson took 15. And Charlotte com-
mitted 11 fouls to Davidson’s 10. This was a
hard fought game full of heart until the very
end. =.

“T’m disappointed that we were unable to
come away with a victory,” said head coach
Kevin Hundley. “But I’m encouraged by the
fact that we had the composure and heart to
get.a goal back in the first half, and then
continued to-work until literally almost the—

win.
