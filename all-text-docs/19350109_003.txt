DAVIDSON WINS
THRILLER OVER
WOFFORD FIVE

In the Field of Sports

PRITCHETT MAKES
INITIAL CALL TO
CAT CINDER TEAM

by MAIORT BROWN

Coach “Red” Laird’s 1935 edition of
Wildcat basketeers so far has shown
considerable improvement over the out-
fit of a year ago, which fact, I think, is
due very largely to the unusual situation
of competition that has arisen between
the several lettermen returned from the
1934 quintet and a group of highly prom-
ising Sophomores trying out for the first
time among the varsity ranks.

Wit ing the Wildcat: inst
the Wofford Terriers last Thurs-
day night they seemed to have
much more life and pep than was
ever displayed last season: Every
man was in there and scrapping
not simply for that particular
game but for his position in the
Davidson line up. y
It looks like a new deal for Davidson

in the cage this winter, with five letter-
men on the roster being pushed consist-
ently by an equal number of snappy look-
ing second year men.

Jim Morgan and Charlie Hood
have managed to hold down their
positions fairly well, but such
Centennials as Maurice Peabody,
Clifford Quick, and Kenneth
Knorr, are giving Courtney Ross,
Hugh Yelverton and Coley Wind-
ham plenty of stiff opposition.

A NEW GYMN

While jabbering about the basketball
situation it might be well to mention the
need for a’more adequate gymnasium at
Davidson.

The present structure used for
basketball g is so inadequat
that the athletic officials are
forced to schedule games with
such formidable foes as Carolina
and Duke in towns where more
room can be secured to accom-

dat, p q tly

the Davidson students who pay a

fee for the best program available

in all sports are forced to content
themselves with competition of an
inferior type.

This year the contest with Duke was
played in Winston-Salem, and the Caro-
lina game was taken to Charlotte, simply
because the Davidson gym has no space
for outsiders after the students have all
gotten their seats. within it.

Such a situation not only causes
the students to be deprived of
the best basketball entertainment,
but it also keeps basketball from
being a self-supporting sport, and
since there is only one court ac-
cessible to six hundred students
the hes have hat of a
problem when they attempt to use
it for varsity and freshman prac-
tise and games in addition to hav-
ing it available for intramural
games.

There is certainly no doubt about a
need for a larger gymnasium on the
Davidson campus, but it takes money to
build one, and since none of that is
handy, I believe it will take an equal
amount of patience, to get new quarters
for the Wildcats.

NEWTON AND McEVER -

It has been rumored around the
campus for some time that Coach
Gene McEver had received an
offer to b istant h at
the University of Tennessee, and
now a great deal of talk is being.

Saturday afternoon, weighing in at 3:00.

Following this meet, regular practice
will be discontinued until after exams.
The first clash of next semester will be
on Saturday, February 2 when the Wild-
cats meet Duke.

Rumors Are Denied By
Cat Football Coaches

There have been many rumors during
the past month concerning the possibili-
ties of Coaches Newton and McEver
leaving Davidson to accept positions at
other colleges. These possibilities still
exist, however, no definite action has
been taken by either of the two.

Coach Newton has received an offer
from the University of South Carolina
but has not accepted the offer because he
is very well satisfied with his place at
Davidson. Coach Newton has intimated
that he would have to receive a sub>
stantial salary increase before he will
consider any such offer. It has been re-
peatedly rumored that Coach McEwer
has received a coaching offer from the
University of Tennessee, his alma mater,
where he made a name for himself as
an All-American player. MckEver re-
fuses to discuss the question and denies
any knowledge of such an offer. He also
expresses satisfaction with his present
position at Davidson.

Newton and McEver came to David-
son in 1932 and have just completed their
third season as mentors of the Wildcat
eleven. They have been responsible for
a football renaissance at Davidson and
have brought the Wildcats to a place
where they furnish keen competition for
the larger colleges on their schedule.
Newton and McEver have received the
wholehearted support of the student body
and faculty in their efforts to produce
a winning team.

his position as the University of

South Carolina tutor.

These men, of ‘course, are not bound
iron cladly to the Davidson staff, but is
isn’t likely that they will give up their
position at the Presbyterian institution
unless an extremely more profitable offer
presents itself.

EARLY TRACK
Captain Pritchett, and Coach
Pete Whittle have called for both
varsity and freshmen track candi-
dates to report and begin training
for the spring season. The
coaches are going to need to de-
velop a lot of excellent track ma-
terial between now and the open-
ing of the regular season in order
to fill tremendously large gaps
that opened up with the gradua-
tion of several stars and the fail-
ure of several others to return to
school.
If there is any talent,on hand you can
depend upon Coaches Pritchett and Whit-

igns as
_ Billy Laval who recently resigned

tle to discover it and develop it.

Preparations Made For
Annual Boxing Tourney

Preparations for the intramural
boxing tournament to be held a
month from now will begin this
week with the opening of a class of
instruction in the art of pugilistics.

Capt. Norton G. Pritchett, Direc-
tor of Athletics, will give instruc-
tions in the upper room of the old
gymnasium to those students who
wish to enter the competition. The
teaching will take up the funda-
mentals and gradually work up to
sparring. The tentative time for
these lessons as “The Davidsonian”
goes to press is from 4:30 to six
every afternoon. .

Attractive medals for the winners
in each of the seven classes have
already been secured. The tourna-
ment is a regular sport of the col-
lege’s intramural athletic program.

The seven weight limits are: 115,
125, 135, 145, 160, 175 pounds and
the unlimited weight class. The
tournament will probably last two
days.

Four of last year’s winners are
still enrolled in school. They are
Coley Windham, 175 pounds class
winner; John Lee, 160 pounds;
Earle Frazier, 145 pounds and
Knox Thompson, winner of the
trophy in the 135 pound class.

The Wildcats met a strong outfit from
Oglethorpe last night in the Davidson

KITTEN COACH

Mr. Grier Martin, alumni secretary and
publicity director, has taken over the
coaching of freshman basketball - this
year.

Martin played varsity basketball
at Davidson for three years and upon
graduation coached intramural ball at
Emory University while obtaining his
M.A. degree there. He succeeds Bruce
Peabody at his new post.

TRAINING BEGINS
FOR TRAGK MEN

Early Practice To Select Men To
Fill Seven Gaps

With ‘Old Man Football hibernating
for the winter and Basketball»new in the
sport world’s fancy, rumbles of activity
were heard from Trackdom this week as
Capt. N. G, Pritchett issued a special call
for the track squad.

The for the early show of
hands is that seven gaps must be filled
in the squad if it is to equal the mark
set by its predecessors. The 100 and 220
yard sprints were left vacant by the fail-
ure of “Ras” Evans and “Mokey” Faison
to return and the graduation of Miller
Cochran, record breaking Captain of
last year’s team, Will he sorely felt in the
shot and discus events. The 440 -and
the 880 yard runs are also in the state of
partial vacuity.

reason

To aid in developing talent for these
events Pritchett announces that a board
track, six feet wide and 150 yards long
will be constructed on the quadrangle in
front of Georgia dormitory. He asks
that all who have any possibilities or ex-
perience whatever turn out for practice.

In a further effort to discover new
talent Pritchett revealed plans for an
event similar to the decathlon, to be held
shortly before the track season. ‘This
event lasts two weeks and is purely an
individual affair.

Contestants may enter any or all of
the probably fourteen events that will be
run but will only be allowed to count
ten of them in his scoring. The

of points will be given an award and

The fourteen probable events will be:

jumps, the shot putt, discus and javelin
throw; the high and low hurdles.

Whittle. The next tournament after
exams will the soccer tournament
which was supposed to have been run be-
fore the holidays, but was postponed be-
cause the volley’ ball tournament wasn't
finished in time. Soccer is a new game
in the intramural program at Davidson,
and much interest has been shown in it
since its introduction here last fall.

Thrilling 40-35 Win Over

OTHER GAME CLOSE

Wildcats Lost To Duke 39-35;
, To Carolina 36-26

In a game that featured possibly the
most thrilling basketball rally ever stag-
ed in the Wildcats’ lair, a scrappy David-
son quint shot baskets at all angles in
the last few minutes of play to top the
Wofford Terriers 40-35,

Trailing 22-12 at the half, the ’Cats
gradually worked up to a one point lead
over the South Carolinians in the last
part of the game. However, a foul shot
by Wofford tied the score and caused an
extra period playoff.

It was in the extra five minutes of
play that the Wildcat five led by Kenneth
Knorr, put the game on ice with a bril-
liant scoring dash which netted five
points., Wofford was held scoreless dur-
ing the extra period.

Davidson opened up the game with a
slow lifeless ‘start, but with the aid of
Morgan and Peabody, the game picked
up considerably. Anderson of Wofford
led the scoring with 12 points, while
Morgan followed with 10 counters,

Duke 39—Davidson 35
Meeting unexpected opposition, the
highly touted Duke University quint was
hard pressed to nose out a fighting Wild-
cat five, 39-35, in a game sponsored by
the Winston-Salem Junior Chamber of
Commerce in the R. J. Reynolds High
School gynasium.

The Biue Devils got the jump at the
sound of the opening whistle, but the
'Cats led by the efforts-of Jim Morgan,
elongated center, forged ahead before
the half ended to pocket a one point
lead over the Durham team. However,
Eddie Cameron’s charges retaliated just
before the rest period, with a vigorous
attack which restored the Dukes to a 17-
14. margin.

Coming back in the second half, the
’Cats staged several exciting rallies, but
the appearance of Kunkle of Duke in
the game and his subsequent netting of
eight points, put the game away for the
University quint.

Morgan, Peabody, and Quick,
outstanding for Davidson, as were Bell,
Kunkle, and, Pollock for Duke. Approx-
imately 800 people saw the game.

North Carolina 36—Davidson 26

North Carolina’s mighty “White
Phantoms” breezed into Charlotte last
Saturday night, and turned back a fight-
ing Wildcat five in Central High gym.
Webster, Carolina center, led the scoring
with a total of 13 points.

The two teams appeared to be evenly
matched at the outset of the game, but
Webster with the help of Aiken and Mc-
Cachren, stepped in to open up the fire-
works that gave the phantoms a 19-11
lead at the half.

Captain Harris of Davidson, however,
rang up a long shot from the center of
the court, starting a rally that cut the
lead to six points. Morgan instigated
the second important Wildcat rally of the
game, but Aitken of Carolina put up
vigorous opposition and the threat ended.
