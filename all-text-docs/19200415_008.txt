ed in the world had been a dream or
visionary before it became a reality.

Upon his arrival in Davidson last
Sunday at 5:30 p. m., Governor
Bickett immediately went to Dr. J.,
‘M. McConnell’s home, where he was _
entertained during his short stay in
Davidson. !

Following the Governor’s address '
to the Y. M. C. A,, at 6 o'clock, he
returned to Dr. McConnell’s home
where supper was served. Those
present and enjoying the hospitality
of Dr. and Mrs. McConnell besides
Governor Bickett were: Dr. W. J.
Martin, Dr. J. W. McConnell, Miss
Mary Parks Grey, and C. J.
Matthews, of Davidson, and Miss
Elizabeth Bruns, of Charlotte. |

After suppor, Dr. and Mrs. Lingle
and Dr. Harding called to spend the |
evening. After a very enjoyable
evening, Governor Bickett left in
his car for Charlotte.

SPLENDID BANQUET

(Continued from page 1)

by John L. Price, the Louisiana
Vampire. J. M. Richards, the cute
little nightingale from “Flell Alley,”
was then asked to give a brief re-
sume of the history of the class of
22 thus far. Ina very able manner
Mr. Richards convinced everyone
that the present Sophomore class is
as good as the best by showing what
she. has already done and what she
intends to do. According to the
speaker about fifteen new men en-
tered the class this year because of
the record made last year. It is,
hoped that this is only an index of:
what is to come.

Following “Secretary” Lacy the
only bugler in this country who
blows by note, "Mr. Rolston Bitzer,
then talked on the subject, “What
the Class of ’22 has done for David-
son College.” The class is well
represented in the following phases
of college activities: football, bas-

ketball, Literary, social, and re-
ligious. Pech e that he had
convinced all of standing of the

class Mr, Bitzer took his seat to
allow Photographer Mcllwaine to
advise the men against dissipation
thru the medium of a joke.

The class then offered a_ rising,
vote of thanks to Mr. Pat Gilchrist
and his capable “assistant” for
valuable services im preparing the
banquet. Mr. Gilchrist deserves a
great deal of credit for the success
of the evening’s entertainment.

Toastmaster Knox told of an
amusing conflict of Brice, Gilmer,
and Hamer with Col. Sloan in which
these three were slightly “horsed.”
Mr. Hamer was then allowed to
speak in his own defense.

The speach of the evening was
delivered by Dr. J. M. McConnell,
of the Faculty. The Doctor ad- |
mitted that this was one of the.
pleasantest and most enjoyable of |
the numerous class banquets he has!
attended... In a very earnest and
forceful manner he told a joke and
then gave the class some excellent
advice and encouragement. Some
of the values of a college education ,
were enumerated, and the address
was then coucluded by an expres-
ston of appreciation for the pleas-
ure of the evening and with best
wishes for great’ success for this
class both now and hereafter.

Mr. C. E. Cunningham was then
asked to give the toast to the class’
of ’22 which had been written by D.
L. Mahood.

“So here’s a toast to the Sopho-
more Class,
' To her we'll all be true.
| For the class we'll love from first to
ast
iIs the class of Twenty-two.”
Several announcements were then |
made, after which the men stood
and sung the college song, O!
Davidson! This concluded the ex-.
:ercises officially and all are agreed '
that the affair was a success from
every viewpoint.
