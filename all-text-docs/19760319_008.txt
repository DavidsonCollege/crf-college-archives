Comic books clobber chronic ennui

By JASON NOBLE
Staff Writer

““‘By the hoary hosts of
Hogarth.’’ Magic in the form
of 18 four-color pages; epics
taking place with line and
word balloon. ‘It’s clobberin’
time’’; ‘‘By the Great Pama’”’;
‘‘Up, up and away”’; ‘‘Why
does everyone hate Hulk?”’

To the unenlightened few
who are wondering just what
we're talking about, being
uninitiated in the higher levels
of outside reading (that means
those things with words that
are not textbooks), we suggest
taking a short walk to your
nearest Hub (Ralph would
appreciate it) and locate the
round metal stand not six feet
from the soda machine. There
before you will stand truth and
the American way, the reason
for ityall and the collected
wonders of the universe. Let
us say it clearly: Comic Books.

Where else can one find the
grandeur of eternity (Dr.
Strange #13), the agony of
knowing another man’s soul
(Warlock #12) or the oppres-
sive humiliation that a militar-
ist society can read upon an
individual (any Hulk avail-
able). Obviously nowhere (dis-
regarding the illegal stuff) and
that’s why comic books are at
present the finest literary form
available for relevant, escapist
reading’

We are not here to laud the
important social impact of
comic books, nor are we trying
to impress the reader by our
knowledge of this particular
written form (impressive,
though it is). No, by Odin! All

we attempt here is to enhance
your life (make new friends,
get real opportunities, and
become a he-man in ten days)
by offering you a greater
insight into the world, nay,
the cosmos of comic book
experience. We therefore pre-
sent a brief review of a few
manuscripts now available.

Warlock: Perhaps one of the
finest comic books out. What
started off as a poor attempt
at creating a Jesus-type figure
in skin-tight costume, has
turned into a metaphysical
marvel of interdimensional re-
lations and the meaning of the
individual soul in relationship
to the pattern of universal
events.

Warlock is the creation of a
group of scientists who fled
from modern society to create
their own technological Uto-
pia. However, they turned evil
and decided to manufacture a
superbeing for their own use.
This creation, originally called
‘“‘Him’’ (catch the religious
overtones) was of a higher
ethical calibre and left the
scientists to go on his own
after several years of minor
incidents. ‘‘Him’’ went into
further metamorphosis and
evolved into ‘‘Warlock’’ a be-
ing of super strength, para-
normal reflexes ahd an insane
drive to do good. After a
hard-won battle against the
man-beast, Warlock took his
place in the universe as a
cosmic protector. At this point
one of the best stories to
appear was started; beginning
in ‘‘Strange Tales’’ 178-181
and continuing in Warlock #9-

11 is the titanic battle between
warlock and his future self
“The Magus.”’

The Magus was finally de-
feated by Warlock, who
entered a time probe and
destroyed the path toward this
future and took the shortest
possible path to another future
and killed himself in order to
disallow his eventual evolution
into the Magus (whom it

lock knows he has only

both power and.oppression.

great identification, for who
wouldn’t want the power to
,smash Davidson into little
pieces after setting a 64 on a
math test that you studied for
all weekend, thereby losing
your only date of the year.
Spiderman: Probably the
most popular of Marvel's
books, and, unfortunately one
of the most mediocre. The
character evolution of Peter
(Spiderman) Parker , however,

was one of the best around.
The alienation of being un-
popular as a student and hated
as a super-being, along with
the constant anxiety over his
old aunt made P. Parker one
teenager that you could feel
for. After finally getting a
girlfriend, he loses her when
she is killed by his worst
enemy, who happens to be his
best friend’s father (this is
better than ‘As the World
Turns’ anyday).

However, the stories started
to get monotonous and repeti-
tious and redundant and
predictable. Since this time
Spiderman has gotten another
girlfriend, almost lost her,
gotten back the first one
(figure that out) and lost her
again and is now going with
the second one again whom
one can’t help but thinking he
is about to lose again and is
Spiderman became and has
remained a ‘‘good’’ comic.
This one is for beginners.

Howard the Duck: Designed
to become a classic. The first
three issues have some of the
best art around, and the
writing is superb. This is the
closest thing to an under-
ground comic that can still be
approved by the Comics Code
Authority. The story evolves
around a philosophical three
foot duck from another dimen-
sion who is trapped on Earth.
Befriended by Beverly,
Howards goes through life
spouting ethical. reformation
and damnation upon the
“hairless apes’ (plus an occa-
sional plea for a good cigar).
He is unique in the comic book
field and one of the most
welcome figures to come along
in quite a while.

This is one man’s view of
comic strips, to be repeated at
sporadic intervals, if the spirit
wills.
