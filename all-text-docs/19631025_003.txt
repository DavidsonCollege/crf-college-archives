get plowed. Come on, we’ll use my car

COLLEGEMAN: That swings. Hey, you got a date for the
weekend?

BROTHERHOOD: Naw ..
I'll be snaking this time.

COLLEGEMAN: Listen. I've got a blind date, but I ought!

maybe you'd. . .

thing. I'm broke, sick. and | can’t afford a haircut. Do
you suppose you. ...

ROOMMATE: And you don’t know anything about her,
huh? Damn, I wish I could do it for you, but I’m’‘afraid
I won’t have time. I really ought to start on my term
paper pretty soon. and I been datin’ too much lately
anyway. I may scout around for some dog at Shoney’s
or somethin’ later in the weekend. but I better not com-

there’s any justice your blind date’ll be cool as a beer
and you'll get the laugh. |

LINDA LOVELL
COLLEGEMAN: Maybe you're right. Sure—I’ve never
hung people with bad dates, I let everybody use my
Biology notes, I referee flickerball games for free

somebody my car once. .

PERCEPTION: Yeah, boy. Remember when old whats-
his-face wanted to get rid of his date early and you
wouldn’t let him have the keys until he’d missed the.
train. Hoo Ha. He had to stay with that skank all day!
Oh God that was funny. Wah haw was that slick!

GOOD DEALS: I forgot about that. Oh, me. That sort of
thing could ruin your average.

PERCEPTION: .. . and that business about having to
study you’ve been putting out. Study hah! You just
don’t want to drink with a roach all weekend. That
sympathy program is wild—you ought to bag some-
body with that.

GOOD DEALS: God, we’re sunk.

REFLECTION: Hang on a minute. Let’s look at this thing | :--<
and see where we stand. You got this commitment; you | “”
can't shake it. You don’t know what this dolly’s holding | «
so you don’t know how to approach it. If she’s a fag. |'
you waste time and money. But If she’s sharp, you'll
blow a good thing with your attitude. Now let’s see
what we got to offer—there’s no harm in trying.

PERCEPTION: At least keep the front up. She may have
a sister.

GOOD DEALS:\ Yeah, a little optimism. Shape up and
Yl go with you. Maybe you’ll get a break.

(Enter PERCEPTION and REFLECTION)

SAVOIR-FAIRE: Hey stud. What's the story? You after a
honey? I'm with you, boy. We can’t lose.

WIT: I'm yours too, Collegeman. We’ll put words on her}
that'll! damn sure bring her to heel. Who is it?

COLLEGEMAN: I don’t know. It’s a blind date for Home-

coming...
SAVOIR-FAIRE: Blind date for a weekend? That’s kind
of chancy. | a

WIT: Man, with the wrong company it could last forever!
What do you say we call her and put this thing off? BY SIDNEY L. FARRAR
COLLEGEMAN: It’s too late. She’s on the plane and we, I
have to meet her at the airport at midnight. Red yellow all shades of brown

don't think about it just keep
picking them up and filling up
the baskets and boxes and
everything else cause if you
think. you know, you’ know
you're going to get it done
man why can’t i put them back
on the trees if i could just do
thet but i got to put them in the
baskets and haul them away
somewhere and dump them and
come back and pick up the ones
that fell in their place hell
there’s another gust of wind it’s
fighting me all .the way just
let me get a little bit ahead and
there goes another gust of wind
but just keep picking them up
‘cause. remember winter’s com-
ing and then maybe you got a

reat Place To Visit, Bu

chance ‘cause when they fall
you know nothing grows back
so then comes winter and i’m
getting a little bit ahead yes
i'm beginning to see little spots
of ground and then spring oh
damn the stinking things ther‘’re
more growing back on the trees
but don‘t look at them ‘cause
these patches of ground are
getting bigger and bigger and
now summer and those leaves
just hang up there and maybe
you hope that just this once
theyll stay, just this time but
they stay there waiting until i
pick up that last one and they

s The Fall;

Homecoming Holiday:
’ Rum, Corduroy, Tweed

It took some time for Summer to forge the bands of
winter on her anvil clouds. and while they are sealed fast
it is fall, the interim, and Davidson’s tight sprawl of brick
is huddled between the patchwork quilt of ground and a
dirty sheet sky.

Homecoming is undoubtedly is the return of those who have

a. function of the season. But
there are surely two homecom-
ings to.this, the only weekend
which is a holiday. It is “a Holi-
day,” for so says the Calendar of
Kvents: so everyone will forget
the sky and-the leaves and listen.
to hot combos and, cool singers.

But that is just. another week-
end. Iomecoming. means the
day of the football game. It is
not the same itself, where Dav-
ison will try to hold one leaf,
atleast. on its fall-ridden laurel:
if-is the day of the game with

i girls in spike heels and tweed

suits with corsages which have
been fumblingly pinned on by
dates.

Homecoming is the’ day of
the game, the afternoon
crowd, the way the stadium

! slowly achieves its bone-chill

when you sit in the shadow.
tt is the going to arid the com-
ing from, but never being
there ona day set aside for
doing just that: time is not

| stolen, but spent.

-And. fall us the lime of spent:
time; Spring was hectic with
short sleeves. Fall ig a corduroy
coat before a fireplace wonder-
ing what to do. with freedom.
‘ Mast sleep,off Friday night. but
it-is not the season of great ac-
_ livily. of sadness in quictude. Ut
may be right to fill fall with
[chouts aiid wnoises, hut ’stilf-one
tdreams of a. fireplate and hot
huitéred rum, of. corduroy. eoats
{ and tweed suits.

. Outside of fires and quiet. is
tthe dirty shect and the leaves.
Couples kick through them and
‘wonder at the sadness of picking
‘a leaf before it was ready to
.fallif you are not “entertain.

ing ‘behind an out-of-season

spring face, it is good lo splash.

through leaves and be sorry you
| picked one too soon.

| But most entertain and for-
| get the clean feelings of na-
ture’s annual funeral, perhaps
because it is not like funerals
of men. The trees do not
shroud themselves in black
but in brightness, color, and
beauty. tn these proud wrap-
pings the ghost of life bides
| its time for the millionth time,
‘ anu everything waits, not sad-
ly, but with the quietude of a
| falling leaf somewhere in the
| hills.
\
| This is one homecoming of
Homecoming. the holiday, the
misplaced bacchanal. The other

beon here. They come to the
Zame, they come doin to the
fraternity houses. They come’
because it is fall. and unlike the
bright-shrouded hills they will
dic but once, and they must. re-
turn now to see that the others.
too, are dying.

The comers home have left...

Davidson behind. Football is a
popular sport; so. everyone’ re-
urns for the big game. Really,
everyone returns because every.
one is dying, though in the
spring we'd stop to realize “it.
And because no one can -dic
alone. even the little subtle
dying of fall. they come back to
the others they lived with to
know without saying that it is
so.

And this is fall homecoming,
Without it, this Homecoming, a
Holiday. is another ‘weekend. an
exhaustive and late-sleeping
wing-ding like all the rest, and
{he season of. its occurrence a .
coincidence. But this weekend
is fall. it is not a weekend in
fall. It is <the unmistakable
smells and sights and feelings
that come so quietly between
summer and winter.

And if they come quietly,
these beéutiful rites of death,
they also come suddenly. One
wakes up to find ‘the leaves
havo fallen that night after
hanging so long in their-own
spectrum. The sky was blue,
liquid bive, and now is dirty
white, and the suddenness is
that of our own dreams of
dying.

Thus we are quict when we
shout and. sing, and the day is
not the game but the day ofthe
game. If we bundled in blankets,
it is part of the worship of fall,
and Shakespeare was right again
that we love that well -which we
musi leave ere long.

The tight. littie brick sprawl
goes off again on a merry spree,
but it is, it has to be, different.
Tt is not the bare-limbed bounce
‘of spring or the clothes-heavy
sensuousness of winter: it is the
dignity of tweeds and corduroy.
the quictude of a retutn. the
wonderful longing fcr a fire-
place and hot buttered rum
while leaves fall on a patchwork
quilt, close under a dirty linen
sky.

No matter how or how hard
we run, the fall of homecoming
is there.
