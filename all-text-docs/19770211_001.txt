Terry reschedules self-selection

By LYMAN COLLINS
News Editor
Dean of Students Will Terry
postponed self-selection for
one week until Thursday, Feb-
ruary 17, because of some

irregularities in the process of ©

freshman eating at the various
houses.
Terry said that his office

had conducted a preliminary

survey which revealed that
there were widespread inci-
dences involving freshmen not
being invited to their first and
second choice houses for
meals.

According to Terry the pro-
blem was worst at three
houses—Fanny and Mabel’s,
Phi Delta Theta, and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon.

“There are a few scattered
problems in other houses,’’ he
added.

“I think part of the problem
is sloppy procedure —some-
body thinking somebody else

-is taking care of,things.

“Some of it was carelessness
in getting freshmen the mes-
sage that they were invited.

“‘One can always wonder
about other motives, but it is
best that one not speculate
about that,” Terry said.

President of the Council on
Social Organizations (Co-
sorg) Gary Barnes said that he
thought that negligence was
the primary cause of the
mix-up.

He did not see the problem
as stemming from any deliber-
ate action of any of the houses
involved.

“T still don’t excuse it but I
would not brand this as any
deliberate action,” he said.

Barnes said that he didn’t
think that any freshmen
should be discouraged from
joining a house which over-

Spencer appoints Currie,
Terry to media board posts

By GAIL MAYNARD
Staff Writer

President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. announced the appoint-
ments of Dean of Students
Will Terry and Business Man-
ager Robert Currie as admin-
istrative representatives to the
newly organized Media Board.

Terry stated the board’s
first job would be to outline
these standards of purpose
and get approval from the
college trustees.

Terry said he would dismiss
an editor or station manager if
he ‘‘was not doing his job as
far as getting things produced
or was squandering money,
like has happened before.”

One of the Media Board's
major considerations will be
the reputation of Davidson.

“If publications are going
bad, they will give a negative
impact, if good, a positive
one,”’ he explained.

Terry declined to comment
on the WDAV expansion situ-
ation because he has not
been present at- the meetings
concerning this.

He did say, however, that
he had heard secondhand that
the Media Board would prob-
ably not be consulted in this

case.
Among the various duties of

the board are approval of
media budgets, appointment
and dismissal of editors and.

managers, interpretation of
the community standards of
decency and investigation and

action on complaints.

Currie will offer his financial
advice to the Media Board,
but he could submit no other
definite opinion about the
board’s function because he
had only recently learned
of his appointment.

Currie defined publications

at Davidson as ‘‘vehicles for
representation of the student

mind. The final decisions are.

up to the students, and those
of us on the board can add our
counsel.”’

The publications should also
reflect good taste in maintain-

ing Davidson’s TEP ueEyions

added Currie.

The Senate recently chose
sophomore Greg Hankins and
junior Bert Downs to repre-
sent students on the Media
Board.

Hankins said the purpose of
the board was ‘‘to prevent
falsehoods, but I don’t think
we are a police force.”

Hankins feels the board has
“an important job to do in the
community and an obligation
to get involved in the inter-
pretation of media.”’

He expressed concern about

alse information contained in
the college publications which
relate to the image of David-
son.

If a house doesn’t care enough

Hankins added that the
Update did not do its job to
the alumni who were con-
cerned about how students,
not the faculty, reacted to
certain issues at Davidson,
such as how money is spent
here.

Downs was unavailable for
comment.

The faculty’s representative
to the Media Board will be
announced Friday.

Students

In an effort to bring an

international perspective to
the campus, Davidson draws
students from around the
globe to study here for one
year.

In recent interviews, some
international students at Dav-
idson College expressed their
views on topics of their con-

to do its job in distributing
invitations does the freshmen
really want to eat there?

“There are two sides to the

in,’’ he explained.

President of Fanny and
Mabel’s Freddy Clayton was
unable to pinpoint the pro-
blem.

“The only thing I can say is
that I contacted every fresh-
man that signed up to eat
here. There must have been
some kind of slip-up,”’ he said.

Clayton indicated that over-
crowding on Patterson Court
was partly to blame for the
problem.

“Every house is so crowded
already that it is hard to feed
any freshmen.”’

President of Phi Delta The-
ta Greg Anders felt that the
problem was caused by the
fact that this was the first year
that each house had been
responsible for contacting the
freshmen.

Prior to now Consorg had
handled the invitations for all
the houses.

Anders said that according
to their records there were
only nine freshmen who did

cern. Among those topics was
the honor code.

“We don’t have the honor
system in Japan, because
almost all students would
violate the code. But I had my
umbrella stolen here in front of
Richards House,” commented
Hiroshi Nishimura.

Pointing out some of the
faults of Davidson and its
students from his point of
view, Nishimura remarked,
‘‘Americans don’t have any
hobbies except listening to
music and going to parties and
dancing. I don’t know how to
dance. I don’t see why the
dance parties make them so
happy. Especially, I dislike
the disco.

‘‘Americen college life is

Delts, one first choice and
eight second choices.

He indicated that they had
been planning to get around to
those freshmen before self-sel-
ection.

“The Dean of Students ac-
ted too fast. We would have
alleviated most of these prob-
lems before self-selection any-
way,” he said.

Anders emphasized that no
one had been discouraged from
eating at the Phi Delt house,
‘‘of course we have our own
means of encouragements.”

He said that most of the
people who signed up to eat
there were contacted by tele-
phone.

‘‘We did not go all out to
notify freshmen and as a result
some of the more apathetic
freshmen ignored our invita-
tions,’’ he explained.

Treasurer of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon Jud Bryant stressed
overcrowding as the root of,
the problem.

‘“There were between 110
and 120 guys signed up to eat

Everyone looks to live the
same life.

“The meals are very bad—
sometimes like dogfood. In
Japan, we can select meals
from several sorts of foods. In
Davidson, they have only two
kinds of meat each meal.’’

Nishimura also saw the
isolation of the college as a
drawback, as it restricts the
social life.

Allard Castelein of ne
Netherlands considered the
isolation to be an advantage,
‘‘There is so much freedom.
They don’t lock the dorms like
at Wake or Queens.”
