Georgetown leads the all-time series 2-1,
but all three games have featured thrilling
finishes.

Last year in Washington, DC, the Wild-
cats trailed 26-18 with 3:04 left before
pulling within two points on a 65-yard
touchdown drive. But Paul Nichols was intercepted on the two-point conversion
attempt, and the game ended 26-24.

The final game of the Wildcats’ 10-0 season in 2000 was a 41-17 home victory over
Georgetown in which Nichols passed for a career-high 368 yards.

. The first chapter of Nichols’ storied career came in 1999 at Georgetown, a game the
Wildcats entered as 48-point underdogs.

Nichols entered the game in the fourth quarter and led the Wildcats to a stunning
comeback, scoring 21 points in the final period to win 28-27.

It was Davidson’s first victory over a Division I opponent since a 44-14 win over
Boston University in 1981.

The Teams:

The Wildcats will attempt to recover from last week’s demoralizing loss to Morehead
State against the struggling Hoyas.

Georgetown has lost all three of its Patriot League contests, including a 41-10 home
loss Saturday against Fordham. Other losses include a 27-2 final against Florida
International, 41-13 against Holy Cross and 69-0 at Lehigh.

Senior quarterback David Paulus (6-3, 220) was benched in favor of sophomore
Andrew Crawford (6-2, 200) last week, but neither passer was able to move the ball
consistently.

They combined for 16-of-25 passing for 187
yards. The leading Hoya rusher was fullback
William Huisking, who managed 32 yards on
three touches.

What to Expect:

It’s been quite a while since Davidson was
beaten so convincingly on its home field, so 7" ——
predicting how the team will respond is not bias elec
easy.

We forecasted tight games in each of the past two weeks, but both were blowouts.
Hopefully the third time’s the charm.

All three of Georgetown’s losses have been blowouts, and the Hoyas appear to be
unsettled at the quarterback position.

A team in turmoil makes for an inviting target, so look for Davidson to take out its
frustration on Saturday, although not too many people will be around to see it with
students on fall break.

Coming off a fantastic win over second-
ranked South Carolina, the men’s soccer team
lost two straight games and its number 24
ranking last week, falling 2-1 to Duke on
Tuesday night and 1-0 to Appalachian State
on Saturday night.

The #17 Blue Devils took control early at
Duke’s Koskinen Stadium, as they scored two
goals in the first half.

Duke’s Jordan Cila scored the first goal at
the 13:08 mark, after Scott Noble headed the
ball to him off a corner kick.

Duke’s second goal, which would prove to
be the game winner, was scored by Dorfald
McIntosh at the 30:57 mark and was assisted
by Ryan Kerlew.

McIntosh rifled a shot from the end line to

- give the Blue Devils (6-2-1) a two-goal lead.

That margin remained until the second half,
when the Wildcats began to show some offen-
sive strength. >

In the second half, Duke’s Adam Guren
received his second yellow card and had to
leave the game, forcing the Blue Devils to play
a man down for the rest of the match.

Quickly capitalizing on the opportunity,
Senior Joel Sadler took a head ball from fresh-
man John Latting and booted an acrobatic
one-timer over Duke goalie Justin Trowbridge.

Despite repeatedly trying to ‘even up the
game, the Wildcats were unable to score any
more goals.

“Any time you get behind 2-0 at a top-20

Men’ S soccer falls twice,
loses top 30 ranking

school, it’s going to be a hard hurdle to get
over,” said head coach Matt Spear. “We’re
happy we played well but we’re not satisfied
with just playing well.”

In Saturday night’s game, a Southern Con-
ference contest, Appalachian State’s Steve
Mellor scored three minutes into overtime to
give the Mountaineers the 1-0 win.

The victory improved the Mountaineers’
record to 6-2-1 overall, 1-1 in the Southern
Conference. The Wildcats fell to 5-4-1, 2-1 in
the conference.

While the first half of the match was rela-
tively quiet with each team tallying a mere
three shots, the second half was dominated by
ASU. The Mountaineers shot 12 times and
had three corner kicks.

“Conference matches are all extremely i im-
portant,’ ’ commented Spear. “When you have
an opportunity to get a road win like we did
tonight and don’t take advantage of the situa-
tion, it’s disappointing.”

The scoring drought Saturday night was the
first time in 13 games that Davidson had been
shut out. With the ‘Cats totaling only one goal
in both matches, Spear believes that it is the
offense that needs to get the Wildcats back on
track.

“Right now goal scoring is our number one
obstacle and number one issue,” he explained.

Despite suffering two tough defeats last
week, the Wildcats hope to be ready for action
against conference-rival UNC-Charlotte to-
night. The opening touch is scheduled for 7
p.m.
