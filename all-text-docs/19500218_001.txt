Books Laid Aside

as Influx of Dates

Add Life and Color to Compus

As long-awaited Friday finally rolled around. the whole
campus suddenly blossomed forth with an array of beautiful
femininty. To a book-wearied and love-starved student body.
the appearance of dates was a welcome sight. Some arrived
from nearby Charlotte, many from W. C., Duke, Salem and

St. Mary's, and others from farther
away. As they began streaming in,
attention shifted to Mid-Winter of
1980, and activities began.

, For early arriving dates, things
started off with Davidson’s first
swimming meet, which was held
yesterday afternoon against N.C.
State’s J. V. team. A number of the
fraternities held banquets before
the dance last night. One of great
significance was that of the Miami
Triad banquet held in the college
dining hall. This was the first time
that the three fraternities, Beta
Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, and
Sigma Chi, each of which was
founded at Miami University in
Ohio, have held a Triad banquet at
Davidson. Several of the other fra-
ternities held buffet suppers.

The format dance began at nine
with Tony Pastor and his orchestra
furnishing the music which featur-
ed a number of novelty jazz tunes
and vocals by Buddy James, Adele
Castle and Pastor himself. °

The busy program for today (be-
ginning with classes for most) in-
cludes the wrestling match with

Two Seniors Receive
Commissions in Army

Word was received this week
from the military department that
two members of the Senior class
have been offered commissions in
the Regular Army, effective upon
their graduation in June. The PM
S&T was notified on Monday that
the Senate has approved ‘the ap-
pointments of C. N. Childers -and
Charles D. Parker.

Childers, a native of Lenoir,
completed the college course in mili-
tary science in January with the
rank of Captain. He is a distinguish-
ed military graduate and now heads
Davidson's chapter of Scabbard
and Blade. Before coming to Da-
vidson, Childers served with the
Engineers jn Panama. >

Parker, from Asheville, is a Dis-
tinguished military student and is
now serving in the capacity of Cap-
tain, commanding Company B in
the local ROTC unit. He will have
completed four years of military
training upon his graduation.

Guerrant’s Book Gets
Favorable Reviews

On the first day’ of this year
“Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Poli-
cy,” by Professor Ed Guerrant was
released by the University: of New
Mexico press. The story goes hack
to 1944, when Dr. Guerrant was in
Washington, working as analyst
with the office of IntersAiverican
Affairs and the -State Department.
Right under his fingers in govern-
ment documents, freaties, and news-
papers was hot material for an un-
touclged subject. When hé. left to
come to Davidson as professor of
political theory and Latin Ameri-
can and Oriental history, he had
with him enough notes for a book.
‘Ihe chief problem was to organize
them into a pattern and to bind the
information together with a com-
mentary. By the summer of 1948

he had the tirst draft of several
chapters, and on the way to teach
at the summer school of the Uni-
versity of Southern California he
stopped by the press of the Univer-
sity of New Mexico, noted for its
interest in Latin Americana. They
gave encouragement, and as Profes.
sor Guerrant found spare time at
night he finished subsequent chap-
ters and submitted them. When the
book was finally completed, the
style and organization were approv-
ed by the editor and the manu-
script was handed over to experts
in the particular fjeld, who checked
the contents to the satisfaction of
the press.

The theme of the book deals with
the program. of cnoperations’ with
Latin American nations during the
New Deal era with special em-
phasis on the World War II years.
By putting together concrete facts,
he makes a complete study of the
chronic headaches in the Inter-
American foreign policy. Among
these you will find an account of
what happened and why, .in the

controversy with Mexico over the
1938 oil exproperations.

Through questions as compli-
cated as this, Dr. Guerrant has driv-
en'a far clearer line than might be

Medical Education
Revision Proposed

New Haven, Conn. — (LP) _
Proposing that the medical ‘educa-
tion system be revised so that doc-
tors will not have to wait until they
are 28 or 30 years old before they
can start their own practice, Dr.
C. N, Hugh Long, dean of the
Yale School of Medicine, recently

‘pointe! out that this training per-

iod can be shortened without low-
ering the standards of medical edu-
cation, chiefly. by permitting stu-
dents to start studying medicine at
an earlier age.

“The training uf ‘young men and
‘women for the practice of medicine
now occupies from 10 to t2 years
after graduation from high school,”
he said. “Nearly half the life of a
young man or woman has passed
before they can begin to be self-
supporting in their profession.”

Dr. .Long recommends that stu:
dents from liberal arts colleges be.
‘admitted to a medical school at the
end. of their sophomore year. The
students would then complete their
pre-medical training and start on
their medical courses under a new
revised program.

He proposes that the program bo
developed jointly by the Yale School
of’ Medicine and Yale University
since the student would be taking
courses both at the medical school
and at the college. The new pro-
gram would have a curriculum oc-
cupying a minimum of three years,
and the student's courses would in-
clude the following: first, general
culture courses as may be indicat-

Rabbi Feinstein Says
Religion Can Help Us

Protestant Davidson students
heard a different slant on things in
chapel Tuesday morning from
Rabbi Abraham ‘Feinstein, promi-
nent Chattanooga Jewish leader. Ap-
pealing to the students’ youthful,
unprejudiced outlook, Rabbi Fein-
stein emphasized the brotherhood
of men throughout his talk on
“How Religion Can Help Us Build
A Better World.”

Rabbi Feinstein graduated from
the College of the City of New
York and received his M.A. degree
from the University of Cincinnati.
He has served congregations in
Huntington, W. Va. as well as
Chattanooga, where he is quite ac-
tive in Jewish and general commu:
nity affairs,

The Rabbi, in his talk, showed
religion as a dynamic, this world
force capable of providing the steet
beams of basic truths upon which
a better world can be built. He
said that religion can help build a
better world by: (1) insisting in
the name of God that we help the
needy; (2) teaching that there is
a Supreme Law in the universe
higher than international law; (3)

dents that men’s hands may be
black, white, brown, or yellow, but
the hue of the heart is one. (Men
like Rabbi Feinstein are awaken-

Hampton to Replace
Calhoun as IRC Veep

The first meeting of the Inter-
national Relations Club this semes-
ter, held Tuesday night was high-
lighted by the presentation of pa-
pers from two new members, Har-
old Gillitand and Kurt Biedenkopf.

Harold's papers dealt with the
insulation of International Law, cor-
relating the principles of Machianeli
with those of some of the leading
German philosophers. The difficul-
ties encountered by Nation’s refus-
ing to subordinate their ideals of
nationalism to inter-nationalism
were specifically brought out.

Kurtis theme .of Capitalisms in-
evitable clash with Communism was
brought out by the tracing of clash-
ing-ideals from before the French
Revolution to the present day. He
further pointed out the place of rer
ligion in government and source of
its effects on human history, con-
cluding that religion perhaps af-
fords the answer to the future of
humanity. ;

The meeting was adjourned af-
ter the election of Gray Hampton
as new Vice-President to succeed
John C, Calhoun who graduated
Jast semester. Bill Cameron, club
President, announced that IRC is
‘on the lookout for new men who are
really interested in world condi-
tions ‘to bolster the membership.

fore the Davidson audience for the
second time each within a_rela-
tively short period.

For Jesse it will be her second
appearance within the past three
months. This time Jesse steps down
a notch to play the leading support
role as Celestina Garcia in “Sun-
day Costs Five Pesos,” a Mexican
Slapstick comedy. She had form-
erly played the feminine fead in
the Broadway hit, “John Loves

high school, he was active in dra-

“The Valiant” is a dramatic

America, will be under the direction
of Thor Johnson, distinguished
Americar conductor. Johnson, who
graduated from the University of
North Carolina in 1934 with a
bachelor of music degree and a
Phi Beta Kappa key, is of particu-
lar interest to Davidson students,
since the College conferred an
honorary degree upon him in 1947
in recognition of his splendid work
in the field of music.

But Johnson is not the first fa-
mous conductor of the Cincinnati
Symphony. — Its

conductors, im
chronilogical order, have been
Frank van der Stucken, Leopold

Stokowski, Dr. Ernest Kunwold,
Eugene Ysaye, Fritz Keiner, Eu-
gene Goossens, and Thor Johnson.

Nor,is the fame of the Symphony
to be outdone by the fame of its con-
ductors, past and present. For-the -
Cincinnati Orchestra is recognized
as one of the finest symphonic en-
sembles in the world. With a back-
ground of. fine musical tradition
dating back to the beginning of the
nineteenth century, it came into be-
ing in 1895 in response to the de-
mands of musical Cincinnati’ for a
permanent orchestra of the first
rank which would give frequent in-
terpretations of the best in the
musical literature of the world.

The concert to be presented here
by the. orchestra's 78 virtuosi play-
ers is typical of the excellent sctec-
tions so characteristic of all the
Cincinnati orchestra's programs.
First will be Glinka’s “Russlan and
Ludmilla” overture; followed by
Mozart’s classic Symphony in D

‘The Horse's Mouth,’
é€ morse S$ Mout,
‘Parasites’ Acclaimed

The Davidson College Library
has recently received a numbet of.
new books, among which are the
following subjects: autobiography,
politics, fiction, and humor.

In the fiction field there is the
Book of the Month Club's selec-
tion for February, which is Joyce
Cary's “The Horse's Mouth,’ ac-
claimed by critics as one pf best
‘comic novels in years, it is a first
person narrative, the self-told’ story
of Gulley Jimson. Jimson, as he
tells his story, carries the reader
through 1°% life as am artist and as
a rogue. He is portrayed at differ-
ent times in. heights of artistic crea-
tion. The next moment he becomes
the object of fun and ridicule “The
Horse's Mouth” was first publish-
ed in 1944, but renewed interest
has been placed upon it by the
Book of the Month Club.

Also in the field of fiction is
Samuel Shellobarger’s latest. “The
King’s Cavalier.” The setting for
this highly exciting novel is laid
around the court of Francis I of
France and concerns the Bourbon
conspiracy against him. Shellabar-
ger has in this work created a fine
array of unforgettable characters,
among which are Blaise de Lalliere,
a soldier in the service of Francis .
I, and Milady Anne Russell, an
intriguing young Englishwoman
who is suspected of being an in-
former. These two are caught up
in a series of plots and counterplots
which should prove more fascinat-
ing than those in “The Prince Of
Foxes,” and “Captain From Cas-
tile.”

Maurier, the author of “Rebecca”
