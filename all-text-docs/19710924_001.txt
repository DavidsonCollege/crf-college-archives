SHOULD DAVIDSON GO COED? —

Bevan Expresses His Full Support

By RICH WILSON

“Academically Davidson could
go coed right now without any
problem.”

Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan made
this statement in a recent in-
terview in which he expressed
his stand on the coeducation
issue.

Bevan outlined three reasons
why he felt it is imperative
that Davidson make a definite
commitment to coeducation in
a certain time period.

“If an institution has a_ uni-
que feature academically, then
in some way everything else in
the college -is related to it,” he
said.

“From observation we see
that there are in existence all-
men’s and. all-women's — col-
leges,’ Bevan continued. *'Con-
Sequently there must be some
thing about the individual insti-
tution which reflects why it is
geared toward one sex or an-
other.”

In examining the academic
programs of men’s and women’s
colleges, Bevan said that he
could detect very little differ-
ence.

The question then is: If
both men’s and women’s col-
leges are academically similar,
why are they segregated by
sex?

“The only answer I can see
is that it must be tradition,’ he
said.

Bevan noted that the roles of
men and women 40 or 50 years
ago were very different than
they are today, and the colleges
reflect this.

Women were trained to be
mothers and thus were sent to
finishing schools where they

were instructed in cultural
areas.

Meanwhile men went to col-
lege to be- trained in profes-
sions.

“But the roles have changed
now,” the vice president said.
“Women are entering profes-
sions just as men are, and the
training for a profession is the
same for both men and women.

“No longer can the purpose
of an institution be different-
iated sexually,” he said.

‘‘My second point is that the
four years spent by a man or
women in college is a critical
period in their development,”

. he said.

In isolating men from wom-
en during this period, Bevan
said that men may reinforce
their teenage conception of
women.

“In their isolation they tend
to consider man to be superior
to woman,” he said. ‘‘And they
conceive women to be a pleas-
ure of man rather than another

human being.”

Bevan also noted that it is
at the college age when the
interest between the sexes be-
comes keen.

“Consequently during this
formative period it is import-
ant that men and women get
to know each other, not by go-

~ing to bed each weekend, but

by growing with each other in
the academic situation,” he
said.

“You tend to learn more
through relationships, thus co-
education seems to be a good
learning situation,” he said.

Bevan’s third factor in the
coeducation issue concerns the
inclusion of women in the aca-
demic institution.

“Much of what goes on be-
tween men and women are
things intellectual and emotion-
al,” he said. ‘“‘Both are bonds
and both are equally import-
ant.

‘Although many like to think
that Davidson College only

should concern itself with the

intellectual aspect of human-de-
velopment, we also must deal
with the attitudes and feelings
of the students as well,” he con-
tinued. ‘Only coeducation to-
tally meets these needs.”

Bevan outlined five main ob-
stacles to coeducation which
must be overcome if coeduca-
tion is to be implemented in
the near future.

*‘My greatest concern is finan-
cial,” he said. ‘If Davidson is
to commit itself to coeducation
within a certain time period,
the institution must also have
a plan to increase the endow-
ment. This is essential to main-
taining the quality of the col-
lege.

“I won't make a move to-
ward coeducation until I am
assured we can meet the _in-
creased financial need,” he
said.

Bevan also expressed concern
over the increase in the physi-
cal plant which would be need-

ed to accommodate 500 women.

“The problem is that many
shy away from approving a
plan for increased living fa-
cilities,” he said. “But unless
a commitment is made to drive
fo a certain goal, the question
will never be settled.”

The vice president also men-
tioned that the.alumni will have
to be convinced of the need for
coducation.

Faculty mmbers as well must
become accustomed to women
in the classroom. ‘“‘If coeduca-
tion is to succeed the women
must be accepted by their pro-
fessors,’ Bevan said.

Except for the financial prob-
lem, however, Bevan felt all
these roadblocks could be sum-
med up in his fifth considera-
tion — that of tradition.

“If we can just get over the
idea that Davidson is a men’s
school, we will have taken a
long step in the direction of a

A resolution requesting that
President Spencer, in conjunc-
tion with the College Union, im-
mediately apply for a license
to sell beer and wine on cam-
pus passed the SGA _ Senate
Tuesday by a unanimous vote.

Candidates Point
Toward Sept. 28

BY JOHN KEPCHAR

In the fall student elections
to be held Tuesday, Sept. 28,
over 34 students will be on the
ballot as candidates for vacan-
cies on the Senate, seats on the
Hearing Committee and _ con-
duct council, and freshman
cheerleader.

Though the deadline for can-
didates to register for most of-
fices was Tuesday, Sept. 21 at
5 p.m., juniors and seniors will
be able to register for the
Hearing Committee through 5
p.m. Thursday, said Lear.

This is due to a lack of can-
didates having signed to run,
probably because~ this is the
first year there has’ been such
a committee, Lear said.

Under the new governance
system the Hearing Committee
will try all offenses which for-
merly would have been tried
by the Regulations court and
the Honor Court.

Seniors Tom Sinks and Steve
Williams have signed for the
Hearing Committee.

Juniors Jim Brown and David
Varner are running for the Con-
duct Council.

Running from Belk Dorm,

which has two dorm Senate
seats, are Jim Coggin, Bob Cun-
ningham, Steve LeResche, John
Douglas, Mack Mitchell, Gary
Boliek, Tom. Ioanes, and Dun-
can Baker.

Stuart McCracken is running
unopposed for the Duke Dorm
Senate seat.

Those wno will seek to re-
present Little in the Senate are
Frank Dana, Danny Berry, and
George Kaneklides.

Harris Ricks, Ricky Deal,
and John Hornickel will com-
pete for the Residence Hall Sen-
ate seat from Watts Dormitory.

The Richardson seat will be
sought by Bo Phillips, Larry
Spears, and John McCarney.

From Sentelle, freshmen Gus
Succop and Duncan Baker are
running. Three freshmen, David
Foerster, Thomas Parks, Stern
Anderson, will seek to repre-
sent Cannon Dormitory.

Running for Freshman Sena-
tor-at-large will be Bill Smith,
Steve Canterbury, Robert Cor-
lew, Vince Rabil, and Buck
Farrow.

David Craven and Andy
Chance have signed for Fresh-
man Cheerleader.

Sophomore Senator Doug
Brown, who presented the re-
solution, pointed out that a re-
cent state law has made the
sale of beer and wine legal
and that Duke University has
already legalized the sale of
such on campus.

Scott Keeter pleaded the case
of WDAV, explaining that the
radio station, built piece by
piece over a period of several
years, was in deep trouble due
to equipment failure and the
lack of money needed to pay a
qualified engineer.

“I think that the solution to
the problem is a new studio
equipped for FM rather than
AM transmission. This is the
perfect time to construct a new
studio since the old one will
have to go when the Union is
torn down,” he said.

“The cost would be $7,000 to
build a new studio, and a $2,000
annual budget,” Keeter noted.

The Senate postponed any
further action until the prob-
lem is studied by the Activities
Fee Committee, co-chaired by
Senior Senator Cecil Burney.

Bill Mier was appointed to
fill in the vacancy of a Junior
Senator at large, created be-
cause the present senator, Doug
Sittler, is now studying abroad.

Brown's motion read: ‘Let
the Senate go on record as fa-
voring the sale of beer and
wine on campus. Furthermore,
let the Senate request that Col-
lege President Samuel R. Spen-
cer, in conjunction with the
Union immediately seek a per-
mit to seek sale beer and wine
on campus.”

October 1 will be the first
day on which applications from
colleges for a beer and wine
license will be accepted, and

this revision in North Carolina
statues applies only to private
colleges and universities.

Brown voiced the hope that
beer and wine could be sold to
Davidson students at the lowest
price, preferably at cost. How-
ever, it was pointed out that
the college might attempt to
turn this into a money making
venture in light of its present
financial condition.

Keeter mentioned that he had
reviewed the budget _approved
last vear, and he felt that

the funds were available for

~WDAYV. As one source of fund-

ing, Keeter suggested that some
of the money normally going to
the yearbook might be used.

WDAV faces the problem of
being run out of three dorms
by the fluorescent lights which
tend to destroy reception, the
inability of the station to reach
the off-campus faculty, admin-
istration, and coeds due to lim-
ited AM power, and the un-
popularity of its educational
programs.

COUNSELOR OR DISCIPLINARIAN

Davidson’s Dean of Students not only has to juggle different roles
but he also has to survive severe arm twisting by certain national
fraternities desiring to go off campus. Contrary to circulating
rumors, however, Wiil’s latest calamity occurred on the tennis
courts as he was back-peddling in retreat.
