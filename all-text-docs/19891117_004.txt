Friday, November 17, 1989 THE DAVIDSONIAN

By GEORGE LAFAYE
Earlier this month, a team
of nine Davidson students,
one alternate and four mem-
bers of the ROTC depart-
ment participated in ROTC’s
brigade Ranger Challenge
competition at Fort Jackson
in Columbia, South Carolina.
The Davidson contingent
placed fourth out of 22 teams
from North and South Caro-
lina.
The Ranger Challenge pro-
\ Bran is the Army’s college-

level competition to recognize
the team effort of nine indi-
viduals in seven different ar-
eas, including general physical
fitness, weapons assembly and
proficiency, orienteering,
group road march, grenade-
throwing and team-crossing a
river via a one-rope bridge.
These events take place all in
one day, and there is always
plenty for the team to do. Jun-
ior David Taylor described the
toughness of the competition
when he said, “The competi-

tion lasts from about five in the
morning to seven at night.”
The Davidson group came in
fourth, behind North Carolina
State University, the Citadel
and Campbell University, but
ahead of such larger schools as
the University of South Caro-
lina and Clemson. This show-
ing reflects a great improve-
ment from the team’s first com-
petition in 1987 when they fin-
ished sixteenth out of 20 teams.
Much of this dramatic im-
provement can be accounted

‘Davidson ROTC takes fourth of 22 teams at
Fort Jackson brigade Ranger Challenge —

by the work put in by the
members of the team. Team
member Taylor said that “we
put in just as much effort as a
varsity sport.” To keep every-
one in shape, the training regi-
men includes early morning
practices beyond the normal
ROTC schedule.

One disadvantage the team
faces is that its competitors are
able to draw from cadet pools
as much as 20 times the size of

Davidson’s as well as from —

service, and, in the case of
one Campbell participant,
combat experience.

However, they don’t like
to make excuses. “We’ve
worked hard enough so that
we can beat some of these
bigger schools,” said junior
Mike Peters.

Next year looks good for
the Ranger Challenge team.
They have no seniors to lose .
and all spring and fall to
train for nextyear’s competi-

tion.
