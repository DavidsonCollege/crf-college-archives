STUDENT BODY IN SERVICE

“Remember the’ Days of Thy Youth”
Was Subject of Inspiring Talk

BROWN HEADS PRAYER

Bill Flinn and Jake Mackorell Conduct
Prayer

Last Sunday evening, September 17, the
usual Sunday evening vespers were held in
the auditorium of the new Chambers Build-
ing. This was the second service of its kind
in this year, 1932,33. The first “Y” vespers
of this year, Dr. Walter Lingle, president of
the college, made a very interesting talk_to
those attending. Last Sunday it was also
our good fortune and pleasure to have as
our speaker Dr. Edgar G. Gammon, pastor of
the Myers Park Presbyterian Church -in
Charlotte. Dr. Gammon has spoken to us
before off previous occasions of this nature

_and each time he has delivered an unusually
good address to us, ‘and this time was no
exception, for everyone was paying such
close attention to him that you could have
heard a pin drop.

The service was led by Paul Brown, presi-
dent of the Y. M. C. A. The service was
opened by the singing of a song, after which
followed another song. Jake Mackorell and
Bill Flinn led in prayers. Both of these
prayers were very inspiring and helpful.
The speaker was then introduced by Paul
Brown and he read his text, the substance
of which was, “Remember the days of: thy
youth.” Dr. Gammon then delivered his
message from the above text, citing various

cases and points to bring out his text. He
also dwelt on the question of sex—stating
that the modern college man or university
man would not flinch at the subject when it
was brought up, but that years ago they
would have blushed if the subject had been
mentioned. He brought before our minds
many instances in which said question would
have to be brought out sooner or later. He

_conscientiously..cxpressed...the..fact—that—he
“believed if the fathers: of today would tell
their children the right things about sex at
the right time that they would know what
was right and what was wrong, and that the
inner forege which aroused within us
might be quieted down at the right times.
He spoke of some sons who could cuff their

Junior Election Held
To Replace Officers

When the Junior class met for the first
time this year they were confronted with
the absence of both the class president,
“Shine”’ McMillan, and one of the Student
Councilmen, Jim McClintock. Neither of
these two officers returned to school and
consequently a meeting was called in order
that these two vacancies might be filled as
soor as possible.

Lanier Pratt, vice-president; from the vot-
ing last year, was made president by a mo-
tion from one~of the memibers of the class,
this being the usual procedure in a case of
this sort. He is a member of the Kappa
Alpha social fraternity, Eta Sigma Phi, and
the D Club.

When Pratt became president this left a
vacancy in the office of the vice- president.
Tee Thompson, Lynn Huie, Buck Kirkland,
Mack Holland, and Bill Brown were nomi-
nated for this position. In the voting by the
class Tee Thompson, Holland, and Brown
went out on the first ballot. On the second
vote Lynn Huie was elected. Huie is a
member of Pi Kappa Alpha social fraternity,

ternities will maintain a silence towards
