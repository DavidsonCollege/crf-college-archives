Conclusions

Davidson's nationally -
ranked basketball teams
during the. past several
years have produced sub-
Stantial benefits in the form
of increased student and
alumni interest and in
favorable natignal publicity
which would not have been
otherwise ‘available. An in-
vestigation proves that this
has been accomplished with
little or no academic com-
promise,

When alumni contributions
and enlarged gate receipts
are taken into consideration,
the cost of fielding a sub-

Stigma of being considered
Special students. For this
reason, we _ suggest that
remedial work be limited to
summer sessions and stress
that the options open to
these students be open to
all. (Remedial work might
be required the first sum-
mer and offered on an op-
tional basis hereafter.)

If black students in parti-
cular are to adjust to the
college, it is necessary that
there be persons in positions
of respect and authority

t

sidized team of national
championship potential is
actually less than would
have been the net cost to
the college of a nonsubsidiz-
ed team.

Unfortunately, a school of
Davidson's size cannot com-
pete on a national level in
football against subsidized
teams without some educa-
tional compromise and ex-

céssive financial expense. <4,

Recommendations
Basketball: That the col-
lege’ should attempt to main-
tain basketball at its current
level of excellence, at about
the present financial level
(in 1969 dollars), and with

eee
South, and in some
lor the entire natuon.
This point has been made
forcetully in this year’s Ford
Foundation report; By en-
gaging faculty, students, and
capable alumni in joint ac-
tivities having intellectual or
educational substance and
social value, the instution’s
current faculty and student
body would be reminded of
the long-term results of their
educational efforts.
And they might, through
such exchanges with able

cases,

“and enquiring alumni, make

with whom they. can identi- .

fy. Thus, it will be necessary
for there to be black person-
nel.in administrative posi-
tions.

Most importantly, we will
need black faculty mem-
bers, Experience shows that
such men are difficult to
find and expensive to at-
tract. This is of top priority,
however. We must have
these men if we are to avoid
the kind of destructive con-
flicts that have plagued
other institutions.

© Total Commitment

We have observed that it
is in those institutions in
which the distance between
students and those in power
is great that disorder is the
sad and inevitable result.

We have also observed

that in those institutions
where cool heads prevail
and where administrators

are willing to work closely
With students that black and
minority group students can
be an active, creative force.

These students will have
their own particular pro-
blems, problems which it
will be impossible for us to
anticipate. It will take men
working closely with them to
find available solutions to
these problems.

This brings us to our final
point. This is not a program
into which the college can
casually enter. It if is to
succeed, we must view it
as a major undertaking. It
will require considerable
imagination on the part” of
all the college community—
Students, faculty, admini-
Stration,

If Davidson is
active force inthe New
South, however, it must
more effectively serve the
whole region,

Responsibility For

Continuing Education

It is a commonplace to
Say that the acquisition of
a_lItberal education is a
life-long task and process.
We believe that the respon-
sibility of the College in this
matter goes beyond mere
hopeful stimulation and
should include provision of
opportunities for alumni (and
non-alumni) to continue ac-
‘quiring a liberal education.

A continuing education
program would be a signi-
ficant contribution by the
College to regional leader-
ship, an- obligation which
should be taken even more
seriously than in the past.

We are equally convinced
that a small liberal-arts col-
lege cannot undertake a
wide range) of ‘‘service”
functions which have
characterized many of our
larger universities (and de-
scribed in Clark Kerr's lec-
tures on the ‘‘Multiversity’’).

Our regional leadership in
the past has been primarily
derivative—the work of our
graduates, as they have en-

tered business and the pro- ,

fessions, and as many of
them moved out to offer even
wider leadership for their
local communities, for , the

to be an

valuable changes in current
programs.

Many Davidson alumni
have expressed their desire
and need for a continuing
education program.

In some cases, their need
is for new knowledge now
being developed, especially
that which relates, to the
multifaceted ‘problems of
the rapidly growing urban
areas of the Sguth, where so
many of our alumni now live
and work,

For others, assistance in
maintaining a lively intellec-
tual life would be welcome,
and the college could meet
this by opening more widely
its excellent resources in the
traditional liberal arts.

The college could meet
these needs through a range
of continuing education pro-
grams. Some seminars could
be aimed at keeping alumni
informed about the current
Prograin of the college and
the intellectual trends which
it represents.

The college should sponsor
one or more symposia each
year, dealing with a current
problem, generally in the
area of social policy. These
could use outside speakers—
especially, one ‘“‘big name”
to attract attendance — and
members of the Davidson
faculty as well. .

Programs should also be
arranged away from the
Davidson campus. Meetings
could be arranged inevarious
urban areas which contain a

‘significant number of alumni.

Davidson faculty could then
attend and lead such week-
end seminars,

We recommend further
that” Davidson College take
the initiative in proposing
that the (Charlotte Area)
Consortium undertake the
publication of a journal that
will seek and publish articles
on current economic, social,
political, and cultural pro-
blems, aimed at the educat-
ed layman rather than the
specialist,

By bringing more people
fo the campus—both partici-
pants coming to learn and to
share thelr personal and
practical experience, and ex-
perts coming to present new
ideas—we would reduce the
sense of isolation which
seems increasingly to be a

é disadvantage in our situa-
tion.
Further, the enthusiasm

and fresh ideas of our cur-
rent undergraduates could
make many of these Con-
tinuing Education programs
more lively, and allow parti-
cularly our alumni to meet
and come to know some of
our current generation of
undergraduates.

In relation to an increased
involvement of alumni in the
intellectual life “of the col-
Jege, we should also consid-
er the use of interested
alumni in expanding the edu-
cational- resources available

to our present undergrad-
uates.
Properly supervised in-

ternships (such as those fol-

Football: That Davidson
move toward nonsubsidized
football (nonsubsidized
means here that the amount
of scholarship money award-
ed to a football player will
be determined by his finan-
cial need, as it is for holders
of non-atiletic scholarships).

That the President should
seek out a group of teams
inside or outside the South-
ern Conference with whom
we can compete successful-
ly on that basis, This does
not preclude playing with a
group which, though sub-

sidized, imposes limits on

A Continuing Education
Program will require plan-
ning and direction by a tull-
time Director tor Continuing
Education. Such an admini-
strator could seek and de-
velop new ideas, and provide
the careful oversight need-
ed for programs of high
quality.

For the college to sponsor
an increasing number of pro-

grams’ which would bring:

alumni and others to David-
son, it will be essential that
adequate housing and din-
ing facilities be developed.
This was found. by. our Com-
mission to be a general com-
munity need, and one which
the college should properly
the initiative in meet-
ing.

Relations With Our
Local Community

In recent years college stu-
dents have been challenging
Administrations and Facul-
ties of college and univer-
sities to assume a more pos-
itive and responsible role of
leadership in dealing with
the more pressing problems
of the larger community
outside the campus. °

Sometimes these demands
are expressed in. terms of
making the curriculum more
relevant to social and politi-
cal issues, We find these de-
velopments |wholesome “and
long over-due.

As a positive response to
them, we recommend that
Davidson College designate
a member of the Admini-
strative Staff to be respon-
sible for the area of local
community relations.

He should be directly re-
sponsible to the President
and be able to represent the
President in dealing with off-
campus agencies in the larg-
er community and to inter-
pret the policies of the col-
lege to the alumni and the
general public.

At the present time many
faculty skills and interests
are under-employed or frus-
trated because of a lack ‘of
leadership and the failure
to establish priorities,

The administrator assign-
ed to the area of local com-
munity relations should be
given the time, means and
clearly defined job analysis
to enable him to accomplish
the basic objectives.

Davidson College brings
together in its Saff, Faculty
and students a rich and
varied collection of skills
and resources. It is indeed
ironical that many - of its
non-academic employees and
their families do not share
in the benefits of a commun-
ity which their labor helps
to sustain.

Spme of these non-aca-
deh employees are illiter-
ate or functionally illiterate.
‘Many of these employees are
economically illiterate and
stand in the need of financial
counseling.

There may also be a need
for a credit union or con-
sumer's cooperative. The
College family has a wide
range of ‘skilled persons who
can render valuable assist-
ance in these matters. By-
yond this there may _ be
needs for family counseling
and for the tutoring of high
school children (of non-aca-
demic employees) who need
to be encouraged to consider
the possibility of attending

the quality of life in

_Subsidization below the cur-

rent practices of Southern
Conference membership, if a
nonsubsidized group cannot
be found.

That until such time as the
Board of Trustees approves
a group of the kind just de-
scribed, the present dollar
level of football scholarships
hould be maintained

Other Sports: That finun-
cial support of other sports

should . be maintained at
about the present level (in
1969 dollars), without sub-

- sidization.

Conference: With the sil
ation in the Southern Con-
ference so uncertain, we re-

college.

Uavidson College is to be
commended tor its program
or bringing up to accepiable
minimat standards the pay
scale and fringe benetits of
non - academic employees.
President Spencer is: io be
commended for his public
announcement that black

_ Persons will be employed at

the College when vacancies
occur and qualified persons
are available.

However, both types of
action may evefitually pro-
duce frustration and cyni-
cism unless the College pro-
vides a more aggressive
type of supervision and job
training which will lead to
the up-grading of present job
skills. The College has an
obligation to provide such
training.

Recently a group of our
students has concerned it-
self with the economic status
of the cooks who are employ-
ed by the fraternities. There
seems -to be a considerable
variation in wage rates, with
some being below the mini-
mum standard the College
pays its own employees.

Although the College
wishes to give fraternities a
considerable amount of free-
dom in managing their own
affairs,, the Administration
needs to establish minimum
wage standards for the em-
ployees of fraternities that
will be consistent with those
adopted for the employees of
the College.

It is our judgment that the
College needs to articulate
its own long-range plans for
developments In the light of
its own planning it should
undertake to cooperate fully
with the County Planning
Commission and the newly

organized Town Planning
Committee.
There appears to be a

need for more organized or
coordinated examination of
the
Davidson community to
evaluate the functioning of
existing programs and_ to

identify unmet needs. Re-
creation, parks and_ play-
ground, summer activities,

adult education, and housing
are the needs that must be
faced: The College needs to
demonstrate more corporate
initiative and interest in
these matters.

Ithough one member of
the Faculty serves as
County Commissioner and
another is the Director of
the Charlotte Oratorio So-
ciety, the College has not
made much of an impact on
the city of Charlotte, nor has
the Facyfty utilized to any
large degfee for educational
purposes thé~resources of
the Charlotte city PBovern-
ment, social agencies, the
public school system or ‘the
churches.

‘It would appear that the

Departments of Art, Educa-
tion, Sociology, Political
Science, Economics, Re -
ligion, Drama and Music
have special opportunities
for relating themselves to
agencies and activities in
Charlotte, and vice-versa,

Although Professor Hight’s
Summer Program in Liberal
Arts for Teachers has open-
ed up some interesting pos-
sibilities, by and large the
resources of Davidson Col-
lege have not been made
available to the Charlotte-
Mecklenburg School System.
Since the achievement of
students in the system has
not yet reached national
norms, thisarea should be
a matter of special concern

commend that Davidson
should remain in the South-
ern Conference until the na-
ture of any changes becomes
clearer. :

During the transition per-

_ fod for the conference, Da-

vidson should attempt to
persuade the conference to
adopt ceilings on subsidiza-
tion that would permit Da-
vidson to compete success-
fully on the basis described
earlier in these recommend-
ations.

In order to cover the very
real possibility that the con-
ference may evolve toward
even heavier subsidization
than now, Davidson should
actively investigate the feas-
ibility of competing with in-
stitutions of academic quali-
fy comparable with ours,
that have programs prefer-
ably unsubsidized or, failing
that, less heavily subsidized
than those now existing in
the Southern Conference.

Status and Security of
Coaches: We recommend
that the administration
should direct a thorough and
conclusive study of the
status and security of ath-
letic personnel, especially
with regard to the questions
of possible tenure; long-term
contracts, faculty status and
financial security,

Physical education: That
the president should inaug-
urate a detailed study of the
physical education program
in an effort to make partici-
pation in the program more
meaningful for all of the.stu-
dent body. :

Facilities: That the college
shoutd make every ‘effort to
establish and maintain ath-
letic facilities comparable in
quality with the rest of its
physical plant, attractive to
interested in ath-
letics, and adequate both for
intercollegiate programs and
for intramurals and _ physi-
cal education,

This committee should

That a program be de-

The financial statement below reflects the 1968-1969 Intercollegiate Athletic and Phy-
sical Education budget. Budgeted expenses have been allocated on a percentage basis,
; determined by the Athletic Director. All salaries are included except that of the Athletic

Director, whose compensation is shown under the faculty budget. It appears that bas-
ketball income will be more than budgeted, perhaps by more than $30,000. On the other

Likewise, a number of expenses included in the

No credit is shown for any student fees, free tickets to faculty and staff, or for gift in-

Data on Athletic Scholarships compared to other scholarships.

The college awards a total of 93 athletic scholarships, 52 of which are full scholar-
ships of $2,450. For 1969-1970 a full scholarship will be $2,690. The’ average current award
is $1,817. Total amount awarded is $169,059.50.

If all other scholarships awarded by Davidson are combined, a total of $222,055 is
awarded to 306 students with an average award of $725. No other student receives as much
as $2,450. Fifteen students receive scholarships of more than $1,817, the average ath-

letic grant.

Note: Elimination of athletic grants would not eliminate scholarship costs for: ath-
letes, since many of the athletes presently receiving grants would be eligible

“for scholarships under the regular program:on a need basis.

By-Laws of the Trustees of
Davidson College be re-
scinded.

That each Trustee be sent
a monthly or quarterly news
letter by the Administration
informing the members of
the Board of the activities of
the College and of pending
business of the Board.

That the Board write each
year a letter to the presby-
teries concerning the current
state of the College and of
its needs for the future,

COMMUNICATION

The Chaplain’s office and
local churches

That a job description be
written for the office of Col-
lege Chaplain. We feel that
this is necessary to explain
to the local churches the re-
lationship that the college
expects its chaplain to have
with them, and we feel that
for the chaplain’s own un-
derstanding of his author-
ity and responsibilities this
is necessary and helpful.

That representatives of the
college and leaders of the
major local churches (per-
haps the proposed commit-
tee to be drawn from the
Religious Policy and Re-
ligious Program Commit-
tees) prepare a statement
depicting the most desirable
form of church-<ollege re-
lationship at the local level.

That, for the mutual wel-
fare of the college communi-
ty and the church congrega-
tion, a committee of the ad-
ministration of the College
and of the Davidson College

Presbyterian Church _ be>

formed to review the  exist-
ing covenant between the
two institutions in the light
of the College’s present
use of the Church facilities.

The College and Church
Courts

That the administration
recommend the affiliation of

ordained faculty members in

specific supporting Presby-
teries; that it encourage
their active participation in
presbytery and synod work;

' that these faculty members

aid in the interpretation of
the life of the college to the
church courts and in the in-
terpretation of the actions
of the courts to the College:
and that the ‘College pay
such faculty members their
expenses for the above sug-
gested activities.

That the College express
to the Board of Higher Edu-
cation of the Presbyterian
Church and to the church
courts its willingness to host
church conferences (such as
those held in the recent past
dealing with ethics and
Christian Doctrine): and ‘to
entertain meetings of synod
and presbyteries.

FACULTY

That the formal religious
requirements for members
of the faculty and adminis-
tration contained in the By-
laws, Article VI, section 5,
6, 8, 31, and 34 be deleted.

That the Dean of the Fac-
ulty inform every prospec-
tive member of the Christian
aims of the college, using for
this purpose the Statement
of Purpose of Davidson Col-
lege, contained in the By-
laws as. Article I, and that
he satisfy himself that the

prospective faculty member /
is willing conscientiously and’

wholeheartedly, to teach in
a community having these
aims.

Such prospective faculty
members need not nece-
ssarily be professing Chris-
tains—indeed we think there
will be circumstances in
which it will be desirable,
for educational reasons, to
recruit non-Christians. But
we are confident that, in the
majority of cases, faculty
members recruited in this

way will be Christians.

That the Board of Trus-
tees satisfy itself that any
person selected for the of-
fice of President of David-
son College will be able to
give effective leadership to
the college in the task of
realizing the aims of the
college as contained in the
Statement of Purpose, and
further that. he is prepared

to commit himself in good
conscience to the statements
contained in the Inaugural
service prescribed in Article
VI, section 7, of the By-laws.

We note that the person
being inaugurated as Presi-
dent undertakes ‘‘to be faith-
ful and diligent in promot:
ing the welfare and develop-
ment of the College as an
institution of Christian learn-
ing.’ We feel that, if the
President has been selected
with this in mind there is
every reason to think that
he will be a Christian. In-
deed, we note that the Pres-
ident of the Trustees testi-
fies in this ceremony that he
is assured of the ‘‘Christian
faith’’ of the person being
inaugurated.

+ ADMISSIONS

That statement number 4
on the application under Ad-
mission—Regular Plan — be
altered in such a way as to
delete ‘‘church youth ad-
visor’’ and add ‘‘a non-aca-
demic person who knows you
well’’ in its place. The same
alteration should be made
on the gray recommenda:
tion form to be filled out
by the minister or church
youth advisor.

In addition, in statement
number 2 on this. form the
sentence which reads: ‘‘In-
clude an indication of the
frequency of the applicant's
attendance at church ser- ©
vices and the degree of par-
ticipation” should be delet-
ed. The title of the entire
form should be changed to
read ‘‘Adult Advisor's Re-
port on Applicant’’ and be-
low (someone other than a
teacher, e.g., minister, scout
master, etc.)
