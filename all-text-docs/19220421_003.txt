DOCTOR FLEAGLE SPEAKS TO
STUDENTS OF WAKE FOREST.

Prof. F. K. Fleagle had a very enjoy-
able trip to Wake Forest and Raleigh,
N. C., om Monday of last week. He gave
two talks while at Wake Forest, and
also visited N. C. State, at Raleigh, in

order to observe the work being carried | |

on there.

At 7 p.m. Monday evening he spoke to
the Wake Forest Y. M. C. A., the subject
of his address being the “Ephebic Oath.”
This was the oath that the young men
of. Athens were required to take upon
beginning their second year of military
service. It pertained to the duties of
their state, country, and fellow-man.

At 8 p. m. of the same evening Pro-
fessor Fleagle spoke to the Spanish Club
on the subject of “Porto Rico.” This
address covered the history, the present
political situation, and the problems
found in Porto Rico at the present time.

Professor Fleagle reports that Wake
Forest has an enthusiastic Spanish club,
the students showing an unusual amount
of interest in the language department.
The club is working under the leader-
ship of Professor Goodman.

A very enjoyable part of the trip was
“a meeting with an old friend, Mr. Frank
Parker. Mr. Parker and Professor Fle-
agle were associated together at the
University ‘of Porto Rico, Mr. Parker
having charge of agriculture at that in-
stitution. He is now government statis-
tician for the State of North Carolina.

WARREN COX VICTORIOUS IN

FRESH-SOPH DECLAMATION

Ina spirited Fresh-Soph declamatory
test between the members of the two
lower classes of the Pandeinic Literary
Society, the judges had a difficult time
d€ciding the winner of the medal. How-
ever, after about 15 minutes of indecis-
icn, the judges announced W. M. Cox as
winner, with H. B, Price and D. B. Wal-
thall close seconds.

In the opening declamation Price set
a precedent for his opponents in his
masterly delivery of “The Wréstler of
Phillipi.” Clark Fain followed with the
popular “Wandering Jew.” Cox deliv-
ered an extract from Woodrow Wil-
son’s “War Message to Congress” in a
masterful manner. L. B. Gibbs gave a
flowing declamation, ‘“Hannibal on the
Alps,” and Walthall finished the quintet
with his excellent “Soul of the Violim”
This was one of the most interesting
declamation contests held lately, and it
is hoped that those in the future will be
able to measure up to it in every feature,
subject matter as well as declamatory
abilities. :

JOE EARNEST IS MEDALIST IN
DECLAIMING CONTEST.

Nine contestants struggled hotly for
the judges’ decision at the Eumenecan
Fresh-Soph declamation contest April
11, with J. R. Earnest winning out. Each
man did exceptionally well, giving the
judges a difficult task in picking the
medalist. Earnest gave “The Corsican
Boy” with such ease and power that his
first place was assured, Elkins and R.
G White received reps. The other six
entrants were R. R. Jones, Briggs, Hop-
kins, Martin, Moss, and Paul Patterson.

PAT GILCHRIST WILL SPEAK
AT NEXT SUNDAY’S SERVICE.

C. W. Gilchrist, ex-’22, better known
to Davidson students as Pat, will be the
“y” speaker next Sunday evening. His
subject will be “Good Citizenship.” Pat
is now representing the Hood Brick
Company, of Atlanta, in Charlotte, hay-
ing spent a year at the University of
Pennsylvania. Pat will make -his-speech
under the auspices of the Civitan Club.

It is hoped that other speakers may be
secured, each representing a different
profession; but these plans have not ma-
tured as yet. .

run was’ made. The Wildcats kept
plugging away, making one run in near-
ly every inning until the eighth. The
Baptists confined their activities mainly
to the fourth frame when five hits, two
bases on balls, two sacrifices and about
a half dozen errors produced two runs
for them. Davidson got busy in the
eighth and scored three runs on three
hits, a base on balls, and an error.

It went something like this: Sorrels
and Brice walked, M. Erwin singled to
center and Crawford strolled, forcing in
Sorrells, Bowden caught Brice off third
while he was flirting with some sweetie
in the grandstand, but McLeod again
jammed the sacks when Barnes missed
his grounder. Pritchett stepped up to
the plate next, but his thought were far
away. Apparently they were centered
in deep right field, so he sent the ball
there to keep them company. While the
pellet was making its trip out and back
again three runs came over the rubber.
Freeman then came through with a
single and Pritchett came across with
the winning tally. Sorrells held the
