when some
eighty mothers answered the in-
vitation of the college to» be its

guests for the Mother's day week-
end,
Invitations

Two weeks ago, invitations were
sent to every mother of a David-
son student inviting them to come
visit with their and be
the guests of the college from Sat-
urday morning through Sunday eve-
ning.

This invitation was answered by

and sons

eighty mothers who were seen on
the campus arm in arm with their
respective sons, who were escorting

them— proudly. through the new
library and chemistry buildings, or
seated ‘in the ‘new Y. M. C. A,,

conversing with other students and
their mothers.

Program Highlights

The highlights of the occasion were
the banquet Saturday evening in
Chambers building, | where
mothers were welcomed by Presi-
dent Cunningham and Jim McCrary,
President of the Y. M. C. A., and
serenaded’ by their sons; and the
church service Sunday morning to
which the guests and. their
marched arm in arm to hear the
special mothers’ day sermon pre-
sented by Dr. Carl Pritchett, pastor

vidson.

To use the words of the “Wel-
come” written on’ the Mother's day
program sheet, “It is good to have
here, even for today, those who
have bred and nurtured the lives
of this college—The sons of Da-
vidson.”

285 Students
Sign Pledges

Results of the drive for pledges
to buy War Bonds and stamps reg-
ularly were recently by
Ralph Clontz, chairman of the drive
at Davidson.

Of the 587 students living in the

released

dormitories, only 285 signed pledges.

From East and West, with a total
of 120 in each, 50 and 55 respective-
ly, signed pledges. In North and
South,.with.63.students, 16 pledged.
Rumple, with 60 students, had 26
signatures; and Watts, with 96, had
55 who signed pledges. Georgia,
with 63, had 40 pledges; and Duke
with 75, had 43.
Low Percentage

These results show a low percen-
tage of pledges as compared with
those obtained in other colleges
in the South. The average pledge
at Davidson was about ten cents
per month, The University of North
Carolina boasts a percentage of
85 per cent who signed pledges.

Clontz has asked that those stu-
dents who did not make pledges buy
as many bonds and stamps as pos-
sible nevertheless.

Lingle Makes
Vespers Talk

Sunday night the guest speaker
at the college vespers services was
Dr. Walter L. Lingle, former pres-
ident of Davidson.

The text of the sermon was taken
from the first chapter of James,
and the subject of the talk was on
the necessity ‘of living a spotless
life, especially in these troubled
times.

Pitfalls

In- the course of his speech, Dr.
Lingle mentioned a number of pit-
falls to those who try.to live a
Christian life. Among these were
bad literature, suggestive shows,
and alcoholic beverages -Through-
out his sermon, he read different
passages of scripture to ilfustrate
these different points.
