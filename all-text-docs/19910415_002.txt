Post-War Conflicts

Arise at Nebraska, Berkeley
(CPS) - Almosta month after the
U.S. suspended offensive mili-
tary actions in the Persian Gulf
region, war aftershocks rippled
through several campuses

A group called BURP (Bur-
keleyans United for a Right
Press) stole 16,000 copies of the
Daily Californian offnewsstands
March 24, calling the effort a
protest of the paper’s lack of
coverage of the U.S. victory in
the war.

“Today we have freed the
campus of your vile reporting,
but only for a day,” a BURP
letter sent to the Californian’s
office read.

Three days earlicr, Univer-
sity of Nebraska-Lincoln junior
Paul Koester filed an official
complaint to get UNL officials
to take down a big yellow ribbon
draped over the entrance to a
campus classroom building.

The ribbon, Koester says,
suggests “blind support” for U.S.
Persian Gulf Policy, and violated
university bans on putting politi-

pus trees, windows, doors, walls,
buildings or fence posts.

Congress leader Nelson Mandela
tothe Palestine Liberation Organi-
zation, communism and the Irish
Republican Army, members of the
conservative Young Americans for
Freedom picketed an Iowa State
University address by Maki Man-
dela, the anti-apartheid activist’s
daughter.

The protesters hoped to “raise
awareness to the acts of terrorism
the African National Congress is
carrying out,” Y AF state chairman
Greg Getterman told the Iowa State
Daily.

“Mr. Mandela is just a com-
munistagent,” added Y AF adviser
and University of lowa professor
Enrique Fernandez-Barros. “South
Africa was built by white people
who created the way of life of the
Afrikaners. I don’t want to build
up the myth of Mandela like the
myth of Ghandi was built up.”

Murders Rock Campuses
(CPS) - The series -of ;campus
murders grew longer March 20
when Paula Soto, 19, a student at
Lehman College in New York, was
shot and killed by a small-caliber
stray bullet while playing softball
on a campus ficld.

Six execution-style slayings
within two weeks near the campus,
meanwhile, have frightened stu-
dents at the California State Uni-
versity at Sacramento.

Funding Cuts Shut Down Serv-
ices, Raise Tuition Nationwide
(CPS) - At least a dozen more
campuses announced they would
have to eliminate courses, enlarge
class sizes, raise tuition and take
other measures to cope with
money problems brought on by
the recession gripping the nation.

In Oregon, forexample, Linn-
Benton Community College an-
nounced it would eliminate cam-
pus mail service next year to save
money, while Arizona’s Pima
College trustees said they may
have to raise tuition almost 20
percent while cutting the number
of course sessions.

Ohio’s state campuses will
have tocutlibrary hours and close
out course sections, Ohio Board
of Regents Chancellor Elaine
Hairston added in legislative tes-
timony March 21.

Yale University dropped its
popular “Study of the City”
course, while the University of
Pennsylvania said it would have
to lay off 300 people. In New
Jersey, Rutgers University threat-
ened to impose a wage freeze and
a 9 percent tuition hike for next
year.

likely be at fault for placing a table
or similar object at the entrance or
exit of the drinking area. This is
because the table in effect is a
service area. The House may there-
fore be charged for serving minors
ifaminor weré to take a drink from
the table. Since the Houses only
serve to those of legal age, they
should not be blamed for the fault
of an individual who may leave a
drink on the table. .A more practi-
cal effect of this will be the slow-
ing down of the amount of alcohol
broughtoutof the designated drink-
ing area. This will help curb un-
derage and excessive drinking.

The additional changes made
by the P.C.C. should not be consid-
ered token efforts to appease the
Trustees. Their focus has been to
remove the blame from the College
and the House(s) sponsoring the
party if for some reason there were
an accident.

The difficulty is that there has
never been acase of host liability in
North Carolina to date. Thus, it is
difficult to guess what the outcome
would be in a court case. The
changes recommended by the
P.C.C., however, are expected to
greatly reduce therisk of culpablility
to the College and to the Houses.

Mathabane gave an eimotional speech to the Davidson. Audience

Author Mathabane

By David Smyth
Mark Mathabane, South Afri-
can-born author of Kaffir Boy and
Kaffir Boy in America, spoke last

Thursday in the 900 Room to a’
near-capacity crowd of students |

and faculty. His powerfully
moving speech brought a stand-
ing ovation at its conclusion and
left some students in tears at its
poignant message.

His talk comprised a brief
outline of his life and an urgent
endorsement of liberal education
in general. <

Mathabane was born in Alex-
andra, a black ghetto of South
Africa, in 1960. He rarely had

enough food to eat, as his parents-

had almost no money due to bu-
reaucratic problems disallowing
them from working.

Police raids would routinely
terrorize his neighborhood and
arrest black adults whose requi-
site pass books were not in order.
When Mathabane was five he was
forced to take charge of the house-
hold in such forays to hide his
parents as well as he could, fre-
quently finding himself being
beaten by the frustrated police in
retaliation for his success.

Through the superhuman ef-

Urges Understanding

forts of his mother, he was able to
attend and thrive in school, despite
all the obstacles of apartheid and
economic realities,

Ra The virtues of education were
slowly but surely inculcated in his
young mind, the seeds that would
inspire him to fight the system
with all of his strength and eventu-
ally escape to the United States
with a tennis scholarship...

Mathabane’s arrival in Amer-
ica was not the end of his struggle,
though, and in many ways it was
just the beginning. He was dis-
mayed to see some of the same
racial barriers in more subtle forms
over here. He said, “I did not
escape the apartheid of South Af-
rica to end up segregated in Amer-
ica.”

Interwoven throughout the
speech were repeated entreaties to
make use of the superior educa-
tional resources that are available
to us as American citizens and
members of the College commu-
nity. He said that we have a re-
sponsibility as members of such a
society to better ourselves through
learning to better understand oth-
ers and thus help the plights of
others. “Read,” Mathabane urged,
“it’s as simple as that.”
