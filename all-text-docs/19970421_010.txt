Showtime was 8 p.m., but by 7:45
p.m., nota single seat was left unoc-
cupied in the Davidson College
‘Presbyterian Church sanctuary.
Hundreds of fans from the college
and community came to enjoy The
James G. Swisher Memorial Con-
cert, featuring the Davidson Col-
lege Symphony Orchestra, Cham-
ber Singers and Concert Choir.

In honor of Swisher, Professor
of Music and Pianist-in-Residence
at Davidson College from 1978-
1996, the evening opened with a
tributary English anthem. Six lovely
voices, including those of conduc-
tors Donna M. Di Grazia and Rich-
ard Prior, sang a heartfelt text from
2 Samuel 18:33 arranged for music

by Tomas

(1576-

Gods of humor fill Black Box with romantic farces

Series of one-act plays tickles audience, laughs at infidelity, melodrama, lust, and love

By JosH GAFFGA
Guest Writer

Nary a contemporary play-
wright was out to play this year at
the one-act series as a result of the
daring vision of Dr. Rupert T. Bar-
ber, who courageously led his di-
recting students to undertake the
unique challenge of working with
period pieces from all over the
world, including plays from
Georges Feydeau, Arthur
Schnitzler, J. M. Barrie, A. A. Milne
and Anton Chekhov.

The plays were a stretch of
skill for the directing students but
were also a stretch for the audience

’— of our laugh lines. The series,
which centered around a theme of
humor, was entitled “HA!” HA!
indeed. My usual criteria for
whether or not a show is “good” is
how much I enjoy myself and, more
importantly, whether or not I havea
good laugh (I don’t try for much
more depth than that). These one-
acts not only allowed me to thor-
oughly enjoy myself but also had
me roaring.

The series began with Wooed °

and Viewed, a piece by the father of
French farce, Georges Feydeau, di-

rected by senior Kay Walraven. The -

cast included Josh Roberts as Hec-

tor and Jennifer Neale as Emma.
Wooed and Viewed concerns mar-
riage and infidelity and examines
such in a farcical manner. The two
characters can’t quite coordinate
their actions as both attempt to for-
mulate matrimonial infidelity with

‘the other, but all’s well in farceland

when the curtain closes, as is typi-
cal in this style of play.

The actors had a tough job in
front of them, being the first to
break in the Davidson audience to
this unfamiliar style of theatre.
Walraven did a good job in her
directoral approach to Roberts’
asides, a convention that, because
of it’s outdatedness, is tough to con-
vey to modern audiences. The two
actors showed a lot of energy and
enjoyed the characters’ playfulness,
so far as I could tell, and thus trans-
lated the farcical style effectively.

The evening continued with
director James Lloyd’s presenta-
tion of Arthur Schnitzler’s The Fes-
tival of Bacchus, an Austrian satire
dealing with, once again, marriage
and infidelity. Schnitzler’s message,
however, was more involved than
Feydeau’s. Bacchus paints a pic-
ture of domestic deviations com-
plete with an undertone of the char-
acters’ moral values. Felix, played
with intensity and truth by Trey

Adams, comes home to catch his
wife and her lover, a terribly impo-
tent ego-maniac, in the act of elop-
ing, and he eventually convinces
her, as he convinces the audience,
that she’s always instinctively felt
love and loyalty for him only.
Philippa Finch and Austin Rios
played the plotting couple with a
style that sometimes bordered on
melodrama and other times played
more subtley. -

In fact, the entire play
oftentimes found itself straddling
the fence between laughable farce
and serio-comic satire, a combina-
tion that worked for Schnitzler’s
play as a whole. Billy Roberts and
Rebecca Smith were the hilarious
agents for Schnitzler’s Bacchus
theme. As the lust-struck guard and
waitress, they, at the heighth of
Adams’ “Bacchus” speech, snuck
off to have a love-fest of their own,
thereby putting into action the idea
of fundamental human impulses
which permeates Schnitzler’s play.

The second week of one-acts

movedus chuckling across the chan-

nel to the British isles and then to
Russia and the rarely experienced
humor of Anton Chekhov. My
laugh-filled evening started with
A.A. Milne’s 1925 British comedy
The Man in the Bowler Hat. Di-

rected by Trey Adams and starring
the largest cast of the one-act series,
this creation framed melodrama
within the very boring lives of John
and Mary, acouple who would much
rather sit quietly and muse upon the
local boilermakers’ strike.

Unfortunately their evening is
ruined as a Hero, hilariously played
by Vic Brand, and his Heroine, a
very Scarlett-esque Sarah Zogby,
interrupt in order to evade the Vil-
lain, a darkly disguised Mark
Berger, and a Bad Man, played by
Matt Johnston, who had me snick-
ering with his “yeah boss” charac-
terization.

Leslie Greiner, as the title char-
acter, sits by, drags her cigar and
calmly takes in the action as if she
weren’t present at all. This absur-
dity finally clears itself up as Greiner
shouts “cut” and calls ita day. The
piece worked as an exploration of
the melodrama of theatre versus the
“realism” of everyday life.

The second play of the evening
was The Twelve Pound Look, writ-
ten by J.M. Barrie and directed by
Jess Robblee. This English com-
edy was undoubtedly the most
thoughtful play of the series in what
it offered in terms of theme. Jen
Spears, who impressed me as Kate,
has a run-in with her ex-husband,

portrayed excellently by Nick Paul,
who combined his well-known
comic ability with a more genuine
interpretation of the eccentric Harry.

Kate boldly relates all the rea-
sons she left Harry, not the least of
which has to do with the “twelve
pound look,” the look which wives
give their husbands when they think
they have enough of their own as-
sets to do without the domineering
men in their lives. Incensed by her
accusations of his “ignoble views
of women”, Harry sends for the
maid, Lacy, a sex-kitten portrayed
by Tory Talbot, to have Kate re-
moved from the premises. All this
occurs, though, not before Harry’s
new wife, played with innocent
humor by Grace Robinson, catches
a glimpse of Kate’s “contented”
face and slips Harry atwelve pound
look of her own.

Barrie’s play, in the style of
Ibsen’s classic The Doll House,
contains a great deal of psychologi-
cal realism and complex character
psyches working in sharp contrast
to one another. Robblee harnessed
this realism and presented a play
that was not only enjoyably funny,
but as a more serious and thought-
provoking piece.
