ETIQUETTE OF THE FLAG.

Anniversaries on which the fag should
he displayed at full staff: January 3,
Battle of Princeton; February 12, Lin-
coln’s birthday; February 22, Washing-
ton’s birthday; April 19, Battle of Lex-
ington; May 30, Memorial Day; June
14, Flag Day; June 17, Battle of Bunk-
er Hill; July 4, Independence Dav; Sep-
tember 6, LaFayette’s Birthday; Oc-
tober 12, Columbus Day; October 19,
Surrender at Yorktown; November 25,
Evacuation Day; December 26, Battle
of Trenton; and other legal holidays or
special occasiéns. On Memorial Day
the flag should fly at half staff from sun-
rise to noon, and at full staff from noon
to sunset.

During time of war it is proper to
display the flag continuously, but it is
conductive to the spirit of economy and
to greater respect for the flag to lower
it at night and as far as possible protect
it from inclement weather.

The flag should not be hoisted before
sunrise nor allowed to remain up after
sunset.

The flag should never be allowed to
touch the ground while being hoisted or
lowered. Its folds should float freely
and should be cleared at once when-
ever fouled.

The flag should be saluted by all
present while being hoisted or lowered,
and when it is passing on parade or in
review. The spectator should rise if
sitting; halt if walking: and standing at
“attention,” salute with right hand in
all cases, except that a man in civilian
dress and covered should uncover and
hold the headdress opposite the — left
shoulder with the right hand.

Neither the flag nor a picture of it
should he used for anv advertising pur-
poses whatever: nor as toys, fans, para-
sols, paper napkins, sofa or cushions; nor
as a cover for a table, desk, or box; nor
in anv other debasing manner.

Tt is unlawful to trample upon, niuti-
late, or otherwise treat the flag with in-
sult or contempt: or to attach to it any
inscription or object. whatsoever.—Lit-
crary Digest.

EDTTOR-IN-CHTEF OF
ANNUAL FLECTED

At a meeting of the Senior class on
last Saturday morning, H. T. Lilly was

WHAT SOLDIERS THINK
OF THE Y. M. C. A.

“At it was growing dark”—“On my
first evening at the fort, as it was grow-
ing dark, I stood in the front of my tent
waiting for some of the soldiers I met

[that afternoon to come by for me to take

me outside the fort, across the river,
where they had some personal plans in
which they assured me I would be in-
terested.

“As | stood there waiting, other sol-
diers came by and invited me to go to
the Y. M. C. A. with them, As T was
told it was a convenient placé to write
letters, and having some to write, T came
along.

“Religious services started and the
sermon being so instructive and well
delivered ] waited until it was over, then
finished my writing; as I finished I
heard taps sounding and had to go back
to my tent to retire, without having
gone across the river.

“As long as they live—I learned later
that the fellows with whom I was sup-
posed to go across the river that night
caught something of which the doctor,
who gave us a stereoptical lecture the
very next night, said they can never get
rid of as long as they live. ..... ”

“We are in this war, we're in,
Don’t lose your nerve!
chin,
Brace up and wear a winner's grin.
We will hoist ‘Old Glory’ in Berlin.
The ¥Y. M. C. A. Will help us win.”

“T puess lots of my brother soldiers
have heen in such Y. M. C. A.s as this
before, but as this is my first it is some-
thing quite new to me. | know how to
appreciate it and sincerely hope all the
other soldiers do, for boys. if God be
with us who can be against us, and if |
am not mistaken the Army Y. M. C.
A.’s intenetions to make better soldiers.”

“T sauntered up to the desk and want-
ed to buy some stationery, as T had seen
the floows writing. When to my sur-
prise the clerk said his business was to
distribute it gratis.”

§

“Then again at the ¥. M.C. A. tent

came in contact with fine, clean-cut
fellows that T was glad to meet. Fel-
lows with a proper appreciation of pro-
pricty and decency, with a fear of Gad
in their hearts, and a cleanliness in their
speech that made them good pals.”

This from a former Y. M,C. A. Sec-
retary, now in Officers’ School at Ogle-
thorpe: ‘The ‘Y’ is the biggest thing
there. They are on the job. ‘This place
would be Hell without it.”
