and social expectaions could be

thing that was missing at Davidson
and I am very glad I transferred.”’

by a small college. ‘‘Regardless of

-Betsy Scott, a rising senior at
Warren Wilson International College
in Asheville, N.C., transferred from
Davidson two years ago after her
freshman year.

She left for a number of reasons.
“The kids at “Davidson are quite well
off and one thing that bothered me
was the way the college ran-’" At
Warren Wilson, Scott explained,

students do all the work ranging from

field work in the school owned farm,
upkeep of the campus and dorms, to
secretarial and penasetint aspects of
the college.

Davidson students are “oriented
towards the future”: and the academic
orientation of college was not all that
she saw as important to her college
experience. Students at Warren Wil-
son “are more involved in the com-
munity. To graduate from the college
you have to put in 60 hours toward a
service project for the community.”

The social scene was mor. than

disappointing. ‘“The people at David-
son were into athletics, fraternities,
the dating situation, achieveing and
status games. Here the interests are
varied because there are so many
different kinds of people.’’ Those
immature social games were a real
annoyance and Behrends felt that it
affected his growth. “Because of my
two years at Davidson I feel that I |
have to catch up with everyone my |
age now.’

Disappointed with the physics de-
partment at Davidson, Danciger felt
that the books used in the introduc-
tory course were outdated and that
“atomic physics (was) is'a waste of
time.’’ At Cornell he can take
graduate courses that accelarate
much faster.
