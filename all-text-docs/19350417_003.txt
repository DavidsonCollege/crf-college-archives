Rev. John A. Redhead Talks
At Y.M.C. A. Vesper Service

Tampa Pastor Speaks On Sin
In First Meetings Of
Spring Series

MANY ATTEND SERVICES

Two Musical Selections Featured
On Program

The Rev. J. A. Redhead, pastor of the
First Presbyterian Church of Tampa,
Florida, was the guest speaker at the
Y. M. C. A. vesper service last Sunday
evening, April 14.

The Rev. Redhead took as his text a
part of the third verse of the sixty-fifth
Psalm, “Iniquities prevail against me.” He
retranslated this quotation into his own
words, “My sin is greater than I.” He
undertook to disprove what he called “a
present-day theory that we could sin and
get away with it.” explaining that we no
longer have any distinction between right
and wrong. The questions of right and
wrong that were once looked upon as
black or white have degenerated into a
sort of gray.

Then he proceeded to show two ways
in which it can be seen that we do not
get away with sin. - First, although the
world might not find us out in our sin,
the sense of guilt in the presence of
God will bring upon us such a terrible
remorse that we are broken under it.
Our sin is greater than we ourselves
are,

Next, Rev. Redhead gives us illustra-
tions showing that although we might
even fool ourselves and not be affected
a great deal by our sins, that others
suffer for them, or as a result of them.
He explained, however, that in death,
justice will be dealt out to all;. those
who suffered for our sins will receive
rewards of heaven, while the sinner will
receive the rewards of hell. Not. the
hell we prefer to visionalize today, but
the fiery hell depicted by Jonathan Ed-
wards, with the sinner writhing in its
torments.

Lastly he pointed out the fact that
even though our sins may be so much
greater than our own wills and strength,
that Christ and His forgiveness, offered
by His death, is.even greater than these.

Special features of the program were
two musical selections, the first imme-
diately after the organ prelude was the
selection, “Day Is Dying in the West,”
sung by a quartet composed of Warren
Babcock, Charles .Ramseur, Kenneth
Scott, and D, B. Burns. The other, a
solo, “A Clean Heart,” was sung by
Mrs. Vowles.

The services were conducted by Albert
McClure, secretary of the Y. M. C. A,
who introduced the speaker and read
for the scripture of the evening the
sixty-fifth Psalm.

Prayers were made by Bob Smith and
Harvey Glass.

This service was the second of the
series at which Rev. Redhead will speak
during the first part of the weck. This
series is known as the Davidson Y. M.
C. A. Spring Services.

Students Are Spending
Much More On Stamps

Davidson students have spent
11,207 more of their pennies the
past season on letters, postcards,
and papers than they did during the
March Quarter of last year.

Not only did the quarter show an
increase, but there was a 10% in-
crease for the year 1934.

The Postal Department also shows
an increase of over 30% in the value
of money orders, as business takes
a slight boom.

e Postmast d that an
effort is being made to secure an
early morning mail, which will arrive
about 7:45 A.M. by either bus or
train. This will be put up in time
for the students to get their sugar-
reports and home-town-gazettes on
on their way from breakfast, that is,
those who manage to crawl out that
early each morning.

This added delivery will not only
speed up the mails, but it will do
away with much of the delay and
conjestion that has been present in
the postoffice in the past.

Dr. Cumming Talks On
Group Honors Courses

Dr. W. P. Cumming made an an-
nouncement in chapel Thursday concern-
ing-the Honors Course offered at Da-
vidson. This system is based on the
Oxford University system and is becom-
ing increagingly popular in colleges and
universities throughout the United States.

The reason the Honors Course has not
been as popular before is because stu-
dents have not known about it. Students
taking this course are on their dwn in-
stead of being hushed by a professor,
and really have to do much harder work
to make the grade.

Students today like this course because
they are serious-minded students, and
are willing to work, rather than the
college play-boy of yesterday. They work
and learn things for themselves instead
of being spoonfed by a professor.

Subject to the approval of the pro-
fessors concerned, the eight following
groups may be open to students who de-
sire to be candidates for group honors:
Group 1—Greek, Latin, and Ancient His-
tory; Group 2—Modern Language;
Group 3—English; Group 4—Mathemat-
ics, Physics, Astronomy; Group 5—Nat-
ural Sciences other than Physics; Group

6 — History, Economics, Government,
Business Administration; Group 7—

Philosophy, Psychology, Education; and
Group 8—Bible, and Religious Education.

It shall be left to the professors in
a subject as to whether honors shall be
offered in that subject or not. Any stu-
dent who during his freshman year has
averaged B, or better, and B plus, or
better, during his sophomore year up to
and including the mid-semester grades of
the second semester, may apply to the
dean of the faculty for permission to
be a candidate for an honors group
course. His application shall .be accom-
panied by the recommendation of the pro-
fessors of the group in which he is to
major.

In order to continue an honors course,
the student must maintain an average of
B plus in non-honors classes and must
have completed all the work of the first
three years before entering upon his sen-
ior year.
