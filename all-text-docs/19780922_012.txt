The Davidsonian

September 22, 1978

‘Eminent scholar correlates science, theology

By BILL PEEPLES
Features Editor

While Humanities students
marvel at the near-impossibility
of the multi-talented Elizabe-
than man! few realize that a
handful of such men are alive
and well in the twentieth cen-
tury In our day and age, we
recall individuals like Albert
Einstein, who could not only
write the Theory of Relativity
at a very young age but also
lay a violin as skillfully as a
concert master and write treat-
ises on peace as simple and

a iiiee

eloquent as Woodrow Wilson.

Davidson is fortunate to have
on campus next Sunday and
Monday the first man to receive
an honorary membership in the
International Academy of the
Philosophy of Science since
Einstein over a quarter of a
century ago.

What makes the Reverend
Dr. Thomas F. Torrance uni-
quely suited for this coveted
membership is that he is a
theologian, not a scientist. Tor-
France tor years, ‘Has
schooled himself in higher

mathematics and physics such
that he goes beyond an ordinary
theologian in conversing comp-
etently and comfortably with
the scientists of the Academy.”

While Dr. Torrance remains a
traditional Scotch Presbyter-
jan, a reform Calvinist with a
conservative theology, his
knowledge of the sciences al-
lows him to relate Christian
theology and science in a man-
ner far surpassing his predeces-
sors.

His knowledge of both sides

of this modern dilemma enable

Torrance to correlate God's
occupation of space to atomic
physics. He thereby offers a
unique approach to-understand-
ing the Holy Trinity, the one-
ness of Christ with God.

The Staley Lecturer for 1978-
79 received earlier in the year
the prestigious Templeton
Prize, which McKelway hails as
“the Nobel Prize for a theolo-
gian.” For additional informa-
tion on Dr. Torrance’s visit to
the Davidson campus, see the
itinerary on the Back Page or

dinator for the series.

DC students marry in DCPC~

1B 4) By VIRGINIA ROBERTSON

Staff Writer.
Why choose to get married in

Davidson rather than in one’s
home town? This past summer, |
for example, DCPC hosted two
alumni weddings. Will Terry
and Rush Otey, when posed
with the question, offered a
variety of opinions.

Many of the Davidson fac-
ulty, Will Terry, and Rush Otey
are often asked to participate in
the marriage of students. Mar-
riages that take place in David-
‘son are often held outside as the
campus lends itself well to
outdoor functions.

_ Rush Otey says that he can
remember about five students’
; weddings that have taken place
since the college went coed. He
(Gregg Strader) does ‘that coeducation has
led more couples to him as they

SINCE THE first year of coeducation, five Davidson student
couples have exchanged vows at the altar of DCPC.

plan their weddings following
graduation.

The Davidson campus is a
special place to marry couples
who meet here at school, so
some choose to be married here
for sentimental reasons. The
landscape of the campus lends
itself to both outdoor weddings
and receptions. “

DCPC is chosen for various
sizes of weddings. The church
will hold almost one thousand
people and yet is convenient for
weddings with light attend-
ance.

Dean Terry feels that some
couples will marry here and use
Chambers Art Gallery or even
the Honors Center for their
reception rather than renting a‘
club and caterers.

Davidson students whose
families have moved or separ-

ated often find the campus
neutral grounds to gather for a
wedding ceremony. Away from
their home town churches many
couples feel more freedom to
write their own ceremonies and
to feel that they are planning
their own weddings. They can
include more.of their own
friends rather than entettaining
their parents’ friends.

“The financial burden of a
wedding brings some couples to
consider getting married in
Davidson,” according to Will
Terry. One religion professor
recalls that he has accepted only
one wedding gift from a groom
although he has participated in
many weddings. His common
practice was to return the gift to
the bride but when one groom
handed him a case of liquor he
could not refuse.

Organizations follow up on Activities Fair interest

Hundreds of students atten-
ded the Activities Fair this
year. There on the Union Patio

tudents signed lists indicating

their interest in various extra-

What actually happens to all
those sheets of names? The
Davidsonian talked to leaders of
several campus groups and
found a variety of approaches to
incorporating those interested
students.

Whit Boone was at the Activ-
ities Fair and talked to all those
who signed up for the Union
Concert Committee. He ex-
plained that the committee
needs a core group of ten to
twelve students to work
throughout the year. These

contacts them when help is
needed for a specific special
event.

The Union Cultural Commit-
tee, under the direction of Jim
Patton, systematically mailed
out notices of the first’ meeting
to each person who signed up
during the Activities Fair. At
this meeting interested stu-
dents can find out more details
ebout the workings of. the com-

ices, WDAV relies on staff
members to contact each person
on the list. According to Robert
Payne, the students were in-
formed of an organizational
meeting. There they could spec-
ify their areas of interest.

One of the most thorough
procedures for contacting inter-
ested students is that of the
YM/YWCA Service Corps.
President Glen Darbyshire said
each person who signed their
list was given a brief explan-
ation of the various projects
sponsored by the different
blocks of the Service Corps. The
students signed up under the
block that most interested
them, and then were informed
of the organizational meeting.

At this meeting, the students
found out more details about
the different blocks. Most. im-
portantly, those who had signed
up at the Activities Fair, but
who were not at the meeting,
will be contacted personally
within the next two weeks.
~ The Davidsonian also uses 2
personal approsch to incorpora-
ting interested students. Stu-
dents who signed up at the
Activities Fair are contacted
individually on an as-needed

. basis. ‘‘We’re not concerned
_with getting ecores of freshmen
on the staff first term,’ ex-

“Rather we concentrate on in-
corporating them gradually and
training them thoroughly.”

In contrast to other organi-
zations, the Davidson Christian
Fellowship members depend on
word-of-mouth rather than.a
systematic procedure to contact
interested students.

Mike Lins, president, pointed
out that unlike most groups,

Anyone who attended David-
son’s first football game may
‘have noticed a group of people
wrapped in sheets during half-
time. Right, folks, that is
Davidson's Pep Band.

The Pep Band is a group of
students, professors, and
townspeople who can play an
instrument and want to join.

Stuart Baskin, a sophomore,
heads the Pep Band. His jobs
include writing the shows, pic-
king the music and calling
rehearsals. ‘’I provide basic
leadership and give some sort of
direction.”

Forming ideas for the half-
time shows takes the most time.
The available music sets defi-
nite boundaries. Once Stuart

DCF’s purpose was not to
recruit, workers. Instead, DCF
aimed to make people aware of
the organization and to invite
them to an introductory meet-
ing the following Wednesday
night. According to Lins, this
meeting was attended by a large
percentage of those who had
signed the list at the Activities
Pair.

has an idea, he asks friends who
are not involved with the band
for their opinions.

Previous funding for the Pep
Band came’ from the Athletic
Department. This year, how-
ever, the Pep Band has connec-
tions with the Music Depart-
ment.

Dr. William Lawing is the
faculty advisor; the first that
the band has had. A Davidson
graduate of 1973, he once
played in the Pep Band himself.
Dr. Lawing was also present in
his toga at the first home game,

The follow-up work of contac-
ting interested students is cru-
cial to the success of the
Activities Fair. Though proce-
dures differ, most groups do use
the lists of names to incorporate
new people into their programs.
Because of this extra effort, all
the fun and confusion on the

ful participation in extra-curri-
cular activities.

concern. The band helps add
interest and bring out student
support. Baskin feels that the
basketball team has potential in
the big league; therefore, stu-
dent support is especially im-
portant.

Baskin is disappointed in the
number of band members
(about 35) that turned out for
the first football game. He
senses that there is the possibi-
lity of having 50 players. A
larger group would add not only
depth to the music but also to
the appearance on the field.

Anyone interested in the Pep
Band who did not make the first
game should come next Friday
at 2:00 p.m. to the rehearsal in
the bandroom. The only oth
rehearsal will be on Saturday
10:30 a.m. on the field.
