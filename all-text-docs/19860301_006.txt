By JACQUES STRAP

Recent reports coming out of
the Davidson athletic department
confirm a previously event that is
sure to rock the world of college
basketball after tomorrow’s
scheduled press conference. The
information to be revealed in-
cludes the report of a secret bas-
ketball game between Davidson
and North Carolina at Johnston
Gym over Thanksgiving break.
Davidson dominated the now
number one ranked Tar Heels
105-67.

According to sources in
Davidson’s sports information of-
fice, both schools kept the secret
game under wraps for fear of
going over the NCAA's regula-
tion on maximum number of
scheduled games allowed for each
school.

ceived statistics from the game,
Statistics that reveal the Wildcats’
complete control over the helpless
Tar Heels. Sophomore guard
Derek Rucker led the Cats in scor-
ing with 23 points including a per-
fect 13 for 13 performance from
the freethrow line down the
stretch. Adding to the Cats’ scor-
ing bonanza were sophomore Jeff
Himes with 16 points and senior
Gerry Born, who lead Davidson in
rebounding with 12, with 14
points. 7

Davidson raced off to a quick
12-0 lead over the Tar Heels,
breaking North —Carolina’s
dreaded trapping press with ease
and making life miserable for
point guard Kenny Smith by forc-
ing three turnovers in the first few
minutes.

North Carolina finally got on
the board on a Brad Daugherty

jump shot almost five minutes into
the game. This was the only bas-
ket Daugherty scored all night.
His effectiveness went down after
being hit by an anonymous
megaphone thrown from _ the
stands. In addition to Daugherty’s
troubles, North Carolina missed
back up center Warren Martin,
who tripped and sprained his
ankle during warm-ups and was
unable to play.

Senior Ted Wolfe won the bat-
tle of the Wolfes by holding North
Carolina’s Joe Wolfe to six points
while scoring eight himself.

Everyone on the Davidson
squad played. No matter who was
on the court for the Wildcats, they
could do no wrong. For example,
late in the game freshman Bill Sel-
lers showed North Carolina’s Jeff
Lebo who was the best freshman
in the state by blocking a Lebo

Lucky Heineman shot.

jump shot, grabbing the resulting
loose ball, dribbling the length of
the court and slamming the ball
home.

Speaking of dunks, junior Ace
Tanner connected on five slams of
varying levels of difficulty and
spectacularness during the course
of the game. After the game,
North Carolina coach Dean Smith
was heard to mumble, “I thought
Micheal Jordan was with the
Bulls.”

North Carolina guard, coach’s
son and pre-med student Steve
Hale, held to six points in the
game, summed up the night for
Tar Heels: “Davidson was just
better prepared and wanted the
game more. I got so hassled that at
halftime I noticed my hair was
messed up. It was all icky and
sweaty and | had to comb it and
apply a new dose of mousse be-

fore I could go out for the second
half. I really have to hand it to
these guys. They play ball so well

and then they have all that
academic pressure. Heck, I don't
know how they do it.”

For Davidson the game was a
major success and inspired the
Cats to blow out their first three
opponents of the season. Coach
Hussey couldn’t be reached for
comment, but senior Jim McCon-
key talked about the game.

“Those guys weren’t that

tough,” McConkey said. “At first
I was a little intimidated by their
big guys, but when I got out on the
court I realized they didn’t play
very strong defense and | could
dribble around them all night
(McConkey had nine points in the
game). I wish every game went
the way that game went.”

Sports World Greats speak out

By ANDY BARRON

Some little known quotes in the
sports world:

Danny Manning, former Greensboro
Page star on the real reason he went to
Kansas instead of North Carolina: “I was
going to go to North Carolina, and then I
visited the place, met Warren Martin and
realized that at UNC I would be in con-
stant fear of having Warren trip and fall
on me in practice and break my leg.”

Gerry Faust, former Notre Dame
football coach, on why he never won for
the school: “I’m really a believer in
Islam. My real name is Ali-Fahd
Muhammed and I vowed I'd never let a
bunch of Catholics win if I could help it.”

Michael Ray “Sugar” Richardson of
the New Jersey Nets on his problems with
drugs: “I don’t have a drug problem. I
party, I get stoned, I pass out, check into
a rehabilitation center and the NBA
reinstates me. No problem.” ;

Dick Vitale, ESPN basketball color
man, on why he constantly mentions

Michael Jordan on the air: “Actually I
think that Jordan kid is a M-W-T, a Man
Without Talent. I just mention him be-
cause I own stock in Nike.”

Pete Rose, baseball’s eternal boy of
summer, on how he has managed to stay
in the game so long: “I think it’s a combi-
nation of hard work, constant practice,
exercise and a Geritol tablet every day.
Oh, and my massive drug habit is a big
help, too.”

Dean Smith on what makes a good
game of basketball: “Of course I want my
team to play well and win. But for me the
key is a quick finish so I can get back to
my office for a drink and a pack of
cigarettes before my hands start shak-
ing.”

Hulk Hogan on his title as wrestling’s
world champion: “I don’t know what the
big deal is, the whole thing is a fake any-
way.”

John Hannah, the New England Pat-
riot’s All-Pro offensive lineman on what
he wanted most in football: “Other than

winning the Super Bowl, my biggest des-
ire in football is to pull Mark Gastineau
down by grabbing his hair.”

Bob Irsay, owner of the Indianapolis
Colts, on why he moved from Baltimore:
“I moved at night because the moving
company offered me a big discount to
move after sunset. The main reason |
went to Indiana is the big income tax
break for football team owners. And food
is cheaper here, too.”

Jim McMahon, Chicago Bears’ quar-
terback, on the one headband he didn’t
wear during the Super Bowl: “I was ready
to come out of the closet with my ‘Glad to
be Gay’ headband, but I was only going
to do it if Sweetness would wear his.”

Billy Smith, the New York Islanders’
infamously dirty goalie, on his inability
to stop Edmonton’s Wayne Gretzky:
“Gretzky ain’t that tough. I'll take him on
one-on-one and give him a good stick to
the chin.”

Wayne Gretzky, on Smith’s com-
ment: “Smith would have to slash me

since he can’t stop any shots with his
stick.”

Joaquin Andujar, —ex-Cardinal
pitcher, on his World Series debacle: “If I
ever play the Royals again, I’m going to
bean every one of them.”

Herb Brooks, coach of the 1980
Olympic gold medal hockey team, on
how he feels six years after the team’s
dramatic win: “I still hate the damn Rus-
sians.”

Dr. Robert L. Porter, researcher at
Johns Hopkins University: “We've found
evidence that indicates aerobics causes
cancer in laboratory animals.”

Herschel Walker, running back for
the New Jersey Generals, on why he left
Georgia a year early to play in the USFL:
“The coaching staff wouldn’t let me goto
class because I was on schedule for
graduation. The coaches said they hadn’t
had a black football player graduate in
Over ten years and they weren’t going to
let me ruin the streak.”
