Attention:
Administration

In the heartening campus-wide drive to
revive all the old school traditions, it seems

we have sadly neglected one of the finest
and most venerable. Betore the war there
wobbled in front of the student store a
pock-marked bench, unpainted but worn
smooth by the relaxation of & decade of
evening loungers.

On this subject deceased oaken sulfa
were hashed out the problems of the politi-
cal situation, campus and national, by each
succeeding class. The wooden monument
groaned under weighty issues and riotous
anectdotes for years, when came the war
and the disappearance of the bench. With
the advent of spring and the rise of the
students’ “bull shooting” urge, replace-
ment of the bench outside the “stud”
would seem imperative.

* ok Ok OK Ok

___Recently it has been suggested that the
Davidsonian bring to the attention of the
authorities concerned, the conspicuous a-
absence of fire regulation within the class
building and dormitories. Perhaps an ef-4
ficient fire and disaster bill has been work-
ed up, but if so, it is useless without the
familiarity of the student body.

Of course most of the buildings on

Dayidson campus are considered fireproof,

but so was Atlanta’s Winecoff Hotel.

Letters To The Editor

Dear Editor :-

It has just been my misfortune to have
read a letter in the April 18 edition of the
Davidsonian submitted by the eminent
scientist Mr,-C. A. McNair. As one who
served on this year’s election board and
who has a fair knowledge of the political
setup on some of our neighboring campus-
es, I would like to express a few points in
favor of the way in which elections are
run off at Alenda Tux.

To defend our form of closed politics on
tradition would he both trite and. stupid.
The men who framed our election methods
had no tradition to work with: On the con=
trary, they had some very good and sound
reasons for adopting the method. which
they did.

First of all Mr. McNair _ satirically

brings out the alleged fact that our free-

I

}dom of speech is muttled by the absence
j}ol campaign speeches. [| hasten to point out

that. Davidson College is not a large uni

with students nor

appears some

versity thousands of

a state in the Union as it
people ‘think. Davidson is a small liberal
arts college with a small student body. A
man running for a student body office has
had three years in which to make his cam-
paign speeches — not with a talk from our
sessess the qualities of leadership suggest-
ed by his nomination in a:colsely knit in-

i stitution like Davidson, he will be known,
jvoted for and elected. No thin veneer of a

speech could in any way help. In a uni-

| versity where capable-men are often lost

in the vast number of students, such a pro-
ceedure would not work so well, but at
Davidson it is the best and only way. This
is also true-of our state and national elec-
tions. It is impossible for the voters to
the candidates personally, and
speeches are the means by which voters

know

must select the candidate fer whom to vote.
\gain | would like to point out the falacy
in attempting to compare our school with
a state, city, or country.

Mr McNair
the present system the voters disregard
what the Is this
the fault of the voter or the system by
which -he casts his ballot?) Moreover, he

further states that under

candidate stands for.

ponts out that after voting under the sys-
tem at Davidson for four years, a David-
son. student will not be able to go forth
into the terrible world and vote intelligent-
ly. [sn’t it a shame the way all the David-
son alumni are staggering about in blind
political ignorance these days? Perhaps
the situation might be remedied by re-
quiring all Davidson graduates to take a
literacy test before being allowed to cast a
ballot in a national or minor civil election.

In conclusion, | would like to sight one
example of open polities in an institution
At
this school open politics is the order of the
day. Vhe candidates make speeches and
there are political parties which nominate
and campaign. It so happens that the com-
bined

not too many miles from our school,

fraternities
can swing any clection. A combine of
seven fraternities lead one of the parties.
There are seven “big” offices on the cam-
pus. Ifach year on@ of these groups puts
a_man_in one of these positions. Ah, if
Davidson with her musty political tradi-

vote Vol, seven social

tions could only have open, above the
board, clean elections with freedom of
speech,
Respectfully,
Ed Sutton.

Dear Editor :-

On the occasion of the ODK tap day,
‘we were all proud of Dr. Johnston’s de-
finition of equality as practiced at David-
son. We give everyone an equal opportunity
without prejudice due to birth or breeding.
This has worked with a fair degree of
satisfaction in the student body,

Still these words seemed héllow to a
fairly large group among the students. The
opportunity given Negroes is limited to
the grounds crew, the kitchen and the
janitor force. White jobs are closed to
them, and a chance to enter into the op-
portunities offered by this college at either

the level of a student or a faculty member
is unheard-of:

Perhaps this is what Dr, Gear mention-
ed as being a Southerner before being a
Christian.

Youts in hopes of a more Christian
world,

A great time was had by all at
the Spring Frolics. Unfortunately
(or fortunately) several brothers
started out for the dances but were
detained along the way at various
and sundry places, still... . “a

Brother Winchester was out in
full bloom, ’er sumpin’ with his
cute little nurse.

Both Salem and Queens were
well represented while John Hay

Someone remarked that Brother

out of this world. They must have
been because nobody in this world
got the point.

Familiar vodices are soon to re-

ound through Sigma Hall, for a
arge number of alumni will return
io the campus next Friday, May 2,
for an afternoon and evening pro-
gram which promises to be one of
che highlights of the chapter year.
Aside from renewing friendships of
old classmates and Brothers, there
will be a full schedule of entertain-
ment and recreation, with a barbe-
cue at Erwin Lodge. However; the
main reason for the “Homecoming”
fevent will be the unveiling of a
plaque, in the Chapter Hall, com-
memorating all the brothers of Sig-
ma who were killed in World War
Il.

Weary faces were the order of
the day Monday, after a large week-

last contribution to the Davidson
social life. Many agreed that this
set was the best. It’s rumored that
after graduation Bone will form
his-own orchestra and play for all
three sets next year. His date for
the-Frolics-was-Miss-Nancy Jane
Ansley.

Many new, and lovely faces were
seen in the K, A. Corner. Chuck
came through with another and
Lyles vindicated Chester. Notice-
ably stag were Brothers Stokes,
Macauley, and Faucette No. 2.
Congratulations to Brother—White-

The Operating Table

OY

UY

From bits of information that
have reached this desk from here
and there, it seems there was more
frolicking at the Frolics and after
than met the eye ... especially
after. We hate to give the im-
pression that the’main function of
this rag is to spread malicious gos-
sip, but we do feel that its func-
tion to promote the Davidson
spirit, and that, of course, means
getting to know all we can about
our fellow Davidsonians, So...
here goes. :

As far as the dance itself went,
the big excitement in the Phi Delt
section came when one of the
Wooglin boys wandered over with
his date, who was dressed in a
black strapless that started a few
feet below the shoulders and-ended
same distance above the knees. The
outfit was topped off by silver bal-
let slippers, and black stockings,
that according to our authority for
such matters, “Catfish” Head Sut-
ton, reached well above her lovely,
rounded kneecap. But to get back
to our story—she was seeking one
Phi Delt Iverson, with whom she
used to climb mountains in Mon-
treat, but said Iverson managed to
avoid contact by assidiously taking

is

shelter behind his date’s wide
skirts.
And of course, there’s always

news from the Alpha Sigs when-
ever a big week end rolls around
. this time the’ scene, from all
reports, was Harris Lake, with
“Stinky” Taylor and the Snake
Doctor taking the spotlight ...
only one there not watching the
show, according to reports, was the
“Penguin”, who was busy perform-
ing tricks of his own whenever and
wherever She spoke. . . . So inter-
esting a time was had, as a matter
of fact, that the Senator, squiring
Salems’ one and only “Girl with
the ‘Golden Smile,” completely
wasted $4.80 and failed to make
the hop at all.

The Phi Delts, in no way out-
done by the Alpha Sigs, went all
out and pulled one of their own
down by the riverside. A great
deal of novelty was lent to the
occasion by the presence of the
newly elected prexys of both the
Queens and Davidson “Y”s, who
were beating around the bushes

when. both were supposed to have}’

been attending the big conference
at Johnson C. Smith university.
Excitement for this occasion was
furnished by Brother Oglesby, who
entertained the group with his
novel firecracker stunts. And of
course, there was the “Greek”, com-
pletely out of this world with the
one and only while her r ate,
lugging the novel mone of
“Presh” Divine, made merry with
Brinegar for the evening. . . .

Orchids to O. E., too, for the feat
of juggling no less than three dates
over the week end.

Big linksmen Scofield and Flow-
ers took time out during intermis-
sion to try their luck on a minia-
ture course they happened to
stumble across in the area. About
all that can be said for them is
that they shot quite a bit over par.
. .. Sunday’s morning papers car-
ried a police report to the effect
that a huge B-24, painted a bril-
liant blue, was seen flying low on
the airport road in the weeours,
with flying lights going full blast,
and tying up traffic for miles
around. . . . Don’t be surprised,
either, by the lovely wedding bells
that keep pealing forth from the
abode of the—big;-glamorous chap
in 116 Duke . . . it won’t be long
now... they say he refused to
eat a bite all week end, which, to
say the least, is quite unique.

HERE AND THERE: Lawson
and “Homer” Ragan spending an
hour and 29 minutes Friday night
rehashing their life’s experience in
an effort to discover where under
the sun they had seen each other
before, finally discovering they

MONDAY AND TUESDAY
“DARK MIRROR”

Universal Studio scores another
hit with this psychological movie.
Olivia DeHavilland plays the parts
of identical twins. These two beau-
tiful girls are different only in
their moral precepts. The bad twin
commits a murder and Lew Ayers,
psychologist, gets the job of dis-
tinguishing the bad from the good.
This is a movie well worth seeing
as Ayers does his work(?).
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY

“TEMPTATION”

A Universal drama of illicit love
starring Merle Oberon, Charles
Korvin, and George Brent. Merle
Oberon, termed “unprincipled bag-
gage,” plots the death of her hus-
band, archeologist ‘George Brent,
with her lover. She decides, how-

Fever, against murdering Brent, and

turns on Korvin, whom she kills
with a knockout powder. It has

been suggested that Miss Oberon’s
remarkable hour - glass figure,
which is set off by her eye-popping
1900 wardrobe, might have been
devised, shall we say, or created,
by the make-up department for this
purpose. Nevertheless, it’s there,

“MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE”
This Chandler story, produced by

plot or excitement, it makes up for
in scenery. Bob Hope plays the
part of a private eye, mostly ‘in
the direction of Dotty. The story
takes place in a variety of scenery
as Hope chases all over the coun-
try, in his usual style. Win a new
