Wildcat Trackmen Make

Great Records in Meets

Approximately Twelve Men to be
Awarded Letters at End
of Season

The Wildcats’ 1925 track season came
cats taking third place at the State
Olympic. At least twelve men have earn-
ed their letter for merited work on the
squad, The team was greatly handicapp-
ed throughout the season by both the in-
fluenza and the mumps, which put some
of the best men out for one meet and
sometimes two, But in spite of all
handicaps Davidson received her share
of honors, and in each case presented a
good team against their opponents.

Goodykoontz seems to be the man
in the various track events, with Brand
and McConne]l running him a
second. The events in which these men
starred are the mile run, the 100-yard
dash, 880-yard run, 220-yard dash, and
the 440-vard:dash.

close

In the javelin throw, Captain Gracey,
McComb, and Anderson seemed to be al-
most equally matched, with “Red” Mce-
Comb slightly in the lead.

The hurdles and pole vault have all
been hotly contested by Anderson, Mal-
loy, and Gracey, with “Red” Anderson
holding a slight lead in this.

Soggs and Gracey have been putting
the shot during this season, at which
both have made some mighty good dis-
tances,

It is hard to find a better high jumper
in the state than the wiry man who
wears the “D." Calhoun has very ably
earned his letter.

Varsity Closes Season

Wake Forest and Duke Last on
Wildcat Schedule—Dempster
to Pitch

Baseball for the Wildcats comes to ‘an
end Friday and Saturday,
team plays Wake
and Duke at Monroe, respectively.

when

Al-
though the scason has ben comparatively
unsuccessful so far, victories over these
two ancient rivals will do much to help
the situation.

John Dempster will probably face the
Wildcats in Monroe Saturday. He has
carried the burden of the pitching for
Duke throughout the season, gaining for
himself the title of one of the two best
pitchers in the state. It is said that
the merchants of Monroe have declared
a half-holiday so as to enable their em-
ployces to attend the game. They want
to make the game an auuual affair.

In the V. P. I. game this week, Coach
Monk switched Abe Kugler to first, and
he came across with two of Davidson’s
seven hits. He and Harry Vance ought
to land on a couple of fast ones these
last two games,

Saturday Against Duke

|
| SPORTOGRAPHS
| By Ernest Milton

| Saturday afternoon closes the athletic
season entirely. The freshmen and the
varsity both have games, the Wildkittens

meeting Wake Forest freshmen here, |

and the Wildcats journeying to Monroe,

jto meet Duke University in the final
| battle.
This column ‘is sometimes called a

|“column of bull.” After next week it
| will be appropriate, more so than just at
| present, to cal] it that, for without any
‘athletic games, it will naturally be bull.

With the exception of the varsity base-
ball season, as it has been so far, the
lentire year in athletics has been rather
successful, and can be looked back upon
with a certain element of pride.

It’s a little too early to be summarizing.
That can be done next week. But in
your own mind, just look back over the
the football, basketball,
wrestling, track and tennis teams.

records of

Just at present, the tennis team is
‘working away at Chapel Hi]l in the state
meet, The Eastern trip being so success-
\ful. we are naturally expecting the team
to go in the state clash.

We hope Harry will come through with
‘first honors as he did last year. We
never will forget the whole column that
|was written in the Greensboro News
about Harry and his comeback in the

jlast match to decide the state cham-
pianship.
They said a few words about the

jmatch in general, and then began to tell
‘about a comeback by Harry that should
jgo down in Wildcat history as a great
demonstration.

Carolina has an casy time in the state
track contest, winning it for the fourth
time. She seemed to do it without any
trouble, too. ;

Calhoun was perhaps the outstanding
man for Davidson that day, since he tied
for first place in the high jump. Goody-
koontz must have been stepping out to
come in second n the 220-yard dash.

Forest at Davidson |

Two more years remain for Calhoun,
jand in that time we are wondering if
jhe will improve to the extent. that he
can beat his brother's record, made in
the spring of 1923. Both of them have
;the same form, and are hoping that this
(time he will walk in the footsteps of his
| brother.

The players seemed to think that Wake
Forest had the best team of those that
jthey met, and if that is true, then it
|would be a big thing for the yearlings to
be victors,

Their average as a team has, dropped
considerably since they went away on
|their state trip. Meeting some stronger
teams and going before better pitchers
rather lowered their percentage, but
,even at that they have four regulars hit-
ting .300 or over, and three others over
j three hundred that are not regulars.

L. Hawkins, of Lowell high school,
played a part in that low average, too.
|The Wildkittens were able to get only
seven safeties off him in nine innings,
and he made twelve of them whif the
air. , Hawkins has two more years in
‘high school. If he continues to pitch
jas he did against Davidson both times,
‘and improves proportionately, he is go-
|ing to make some.college a good pitcher.

| tonia. The Wildcats, figured to lose by
‘a big margin, upset the dope-bucket,
|frocked their opponents decisively, and
brought the big end of a 4-3 score back
with them.
