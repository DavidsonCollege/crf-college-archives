MINISTERIAL BAND
HEARS DR.
WALTER LINGLE.

“Witness Bearing” Subj f
; “Helpful Tail yect 0

The Ministerial Band had the
pleasure of hearing another Union
man last Sunday. This was Rev. |
Walter Lingle, Professor of Church
History at Union, and chairman of
the board of trustees of Davidson
College.

As a practical point Dr. Lingle
brought out what a fine thing it
would be for every minister to be
able to play a piano, if not this, every
one by all means ought to be able to
raise a tune. There was no one at
this meeting to play and all present
realized fully what an advantage
such training would be.

Dr. Lingle based his remarks on
this verse, “Ye shall be witnesses
for Me.” What does being a wit-
ness depend on? First, it depends
on what a man knows. Go out and
tell the people what you know of
Christ, not what you have seen in
some book or paper, have reality.
The way to gain knowledge is by
studying and praying. Secondly,
one’s value as a witness depends on
what he is. One can accomplish
more by living a true Christian life
than by his preaching and visiting
the sick, the poor and needy. If one
is not living what he is preaching,
his value as a witness is no good.
Then finally, one’s value as a witness

depends on what he says. Go out
and tell people of Jesus and His love
and His power to save. Learn to
speak to your fellow man about his
soul’s salvation. People expect you
to do it.

Another great thing brought out
by Dr. Lingle was, to live lives above
reproach. Be careful of your talk
and your every day dealings.
Don’t say things you would be
ashamed for your mother or your
Savior to hear you say. Deal with

our fellow man justly and be will-
ing to testify for Jesus.

protection against lightning, short-circuits, etc., which
cause damage and interrupt the service. And now all over
