The Drinking Situation

The Queen's girls are excited
about their drinking rule and whether
they started this year or last we wish
them the best.

Drinking has again become a ser-
jous concern of the Student Council.
The council has wisely moved to
authorize a close committee study of
the off-campus drinking rule. We hope
their efforts will be taken just as ser-
iously by the Faculty Committee on
Fraternities, Clubs and Social Life.

This week we would like to gen-
erally examine the control of drink-
ing at Davidson College with the aim
of simply presenting the situation as
it now stands and making a few gen-
eral observations. In the coming
weeks, THE DAVIDSONIAN plans to
closely follow the Student Council's
actions on the news and _ editorial
pages, and gradually sharpen what we
think to be the more critical aspects
of the drinking controls in an intelli-
gent manner.

At present there are two broad
branches of the drinking rule, both
backed up by the “opposed as a mat-
ter of principle to the use of alcofolic
beverages” clause in the regulations.

The part of regulation (number
four) that prohibits students from
“drinking. possessing. or being under
the influence of an alcoholic bever-
age while attending an off-campus
event sponsored entirely or in part by
Davidson College” is the section the
Student Council is presently concern-
ed with.

Although we don’t plan to go in-
to this rule in depth at present, we
mention as a statement of fact that
this rule is vague and it has been un-
evenly applied. This was brought into
sharp focus last year when eight mem-
bers of the soccer team suddenly
found themselves campused for drink-
ing on a school sponsored trip. They

had wrongly assumed that they could
do what Davidson students had done
on trips before and still continue to
do.

At that time the Student Council
protested the action and requested
that the faculty, as a whole, alter its
position on the regulation. It did not.

The second broad branch of the
drinking regulations concerns drink-
ing on-campus and parties. The for-
mer is, of course, explicitly forbidden.
The only change in the on-campus
regulation in recent years has been
the Student Council and Honor Court’s
deletion of the “under the influence”
clause from the regulations they are
bound to support. The faculty has kept
this clause in its regulations.

‘When it comes to parties rules
seem to fade in the background and
interpretation becomes most import-
ant. There is.no mention, as such, in
the regulations of dance weekend
after-parties. The only social event
covered is the “one” function allowed
each fraternity per semester.

In reality hewever, the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities, Clubs, and
Social Life has indicated that after-
parties are under close scrutiny.

Fraternities were warned before
Homecoming that any incident, such
as an accident, stemming from drink-
ing at a party could result in some
restriction of after-parties. We see
this manifestation of the drinking con-
trols as just as important, if.not more
so, as the off-campus clause.

For this reason we hope the IFC
will seriously consider .studying this
aspect just as the Student Council is
currently studying the other. We saw
what happened when eight men ran
afoul of a similar rule last year. But
the after-party “rule” is not even a
rule. And its undefined consequences
will affect 800 instead of 8.

For A New Meaning

Dr. Rhodes’s talk in Thursday
chapel gives us pause. By the high
standards which he described, there
has been very little worship at David-
son lately.

We cannot presume to speak for
God, Whom we assume to be the ob-
ject of the services at Davidson, but
we do have definite reservations
about His good pleasure at some of
the exercises so far. We can say with
some confidence, however, that very
few students have been noticeably
glistening with faith after Thursday
chapels this year.

Tne system laid down by the
Trustees requires two religious serv-
ices per week. We shall not at this
‘time elaborate on the Good (if there
be any) or Evil of this. We should
rather like to recommend a few ways
in which the system, as it now stands,
might be put to more effective use.

Sunday vespers is an orthodox
Presbyterian church service. By set-
ting and adhering to high standards
of preaching, music, and general stud-
ent conduct, this can be a meaningful
experience for those who are seeking
meaningful experiences.

Thursday chapel, however, is a
different matter. Thus far, though
some of the speakers have had rele-
vant messages, the old, worn-out form
has obscured what good might have
come of them.

We were gratified when Dr.
Rhodes eliminated the farcical  at-
tempt to have hymns sung. We hope
future speakers in chapel will do
likewise.

But Thursday chapel needs more
than this minor change. Here is a
splendid opportunity for experimenta-

tion with various forms of religiously
oriented programs. We think it ought
to be taken advantage of.

First of all, we need more outside
speakers to tell us about activities of
the Church which we don’t know a-
bout. Such developments as the East
Harlem Parish and the Little Brothers
of Jesus are bold new attempts to
make the Church relevant to the mod-
ern age. We'd like someone to tell us
about them.

Various types of programs ought
to be presented, attempting to bring
the various disciplines of the liberal
arts into a Christian perspective.
Dramatic presentations or readings of
Teligious plays or poetry, explanation
and performace of such profoundly
religious music as Bach’s “In Adam's
Fall,” religious films, and many other
types of programs relating the various
arts and sciences to the Church could
help to bridge the gap between David-
son and the Church.

We would also like to see a pro-
gram or two on Davidson College’s
religious requirements and their pur-
poses. A student forum on this matter
with the chaplain, a Bible professor,
or an administrator might prove en-
lightening. A speech on the reasoning
and goals behind the college’s policy
given by a qualified trustee would be
desirable.

These are ideas we have come
their opinions and suggestions known
theiropinions and suggestions known
to the chaplain, and we also hope that,
in the very near future, attempts will
be made to break out of the stifling
old rites and into a bolder effort to
relate Christianity to Davidson stud-

ents.

Joins Theology And Life

BY HARRY DANTEL
Special YMCA Writer

(Editor's Note: This article
Is the first in a series of in-
dividual commentaries that
will be run at regular inter-
vals under the sponsorship of
the YMCA.)

Has American theology come
of age; has it anything to say
about the question of meaning?
Has it anything to say to the
Davidson student? The answer
to these questions is yes. It is
relevant to the needs of the
student generation.

Nels Ferre will be on campus
next week as the Otts Lecturer.
His theology is one of the most
distinctive and dynamic found
on the American seene. Dr.
Ferre presents valid criteria by
which we may analyze our ques-
tions and search for the an-
swers

Ferre is neither a fundamen-
talist nor a liberal. He feels that
neither of these approaches
really comes to grips with the
real issues facing modern man.
The purpose of theology in
Ferre’s thought is to look at
life from the perspective cf the
ultimate.

Dear Editor:

Let’ me begin by congrotulet.
ing Knox Abernethy on his Mon-
day morning chapel coup — it
was beautifully done and point-
edly effective. The speech which
followed was exceedingly fine
too, and I wish to say that I
have no quarrel with the great
Imajority of its content. How-
ever, there was one point, em-
phasized to prove an important
premise, which was such a gross
distortion of history that I can-
not let it pass un-noticed.

Information in this country
about the shadowy Angolan re-
bellion is scant and vague.
Abernethy has been in the re-
gion and undoubtedly knows the
subject fairly well. Yet his
words in chapel utterly neglect-
ed the whole story as it seems
to be emerging. The cries of
“atrocity!” which went up when
the Porteugese air force napalm-
ed native villages, and the Port-

The ultimate for Ferre is
found in the concept of
agape or self-sacrificing love.
it is a self-giving love crea-
tive of fellowship. Ferre tends
to see all of theology as well
es life in relation to this
agepe. Thus for him Chris-
tianity Is a religion of com-
plete concern for all. Theol-
ogy and life are united m this
concept. Again agape enables
Ferre to bring together both
fundamentalism and Uberal-
ism, and to transcend both of
these views in an all embrac-
ing love.

Dr. Daniel Williams of Union
Theological Seminary, New
York, has pointed out that Fer-
re is seeking to unite “the Gos-
pel theme that God is love with
an attempt ‘to understand the
whole of our experience by see-
ing it in the perspective of
faith." Dr. Williams continues
that Ferre is strongly and deep-
ly influenced by Alfred North
Whitehead in seeking to develop
a philosophical rationale of the
Christian faith.

This agape as found in Dr.
Ferre's thought has basically
three characteristics. It is the

distinctive motif of the Chris-

tian faith. It has its deepest .

meaning for man in the Christ
event. For Ferre, love never
fails; it reveals the sufficiency
of God and as a result it is basi-
cally irresistible. Second, agape
is the deepest truth in the uni-
verse. As truth it demands the
response of the whole man. For
Ferre chooses to define religion
as “the whole response to what
is regarded as most important
and most real.”

Finally, agape is the highest
ethical standard for man. At
this point Ferre _ identifies
theology with life. Déan Cle-
land intimated at this when he
suggested that the love ethic is
characteristic of both the verti-
eal and horizontal dimensions
of man. Agape is the ‘way’ of the
early Christians.

1 urge you to meet this man,
to listen to what he has to say,
and to really come to grips with
his thought. For his life has
been one of intense struggle
with the issues and questions
of the Christian faith. His theo-
logical thought is revelant to
the questions that we as modern
men must ask of ourselves and
Christianity.

Chinese Threat Justifies
U.S. Troops In Okinawa

BY DUDLEY SALLEY

As one of the “ignorant ruck” to whom headlines

like

“U.S. Ready to Sink Red Ship” appeal, I am compell-
/@ “# ed to question a recent local expression of World Pub-
” # lic Ovinion.-The thesis of these remarks is that once the

mind is opened, one should proceed to use it.
Yes, 250 miles off the mainland of China lies the

_ island of Okinawa, which has some 600,000 inhabitants—

12,000 of whom have immigrated from Amami-Oshima,
sister island in the Ryukyu archipelago which reverted

~~ to the mother country in 1953.

Okinawa has been colonized into Ft. Buckner to
terminate Japan’s colonization, sic. occupation, with-
out weakening the Far East defense network. This
was accomplished against the people’s political sen-
sitivities, as was the winning of the wer; but full
resistance of their will is tempered to a degree by
their new living standard, as remarkable in its own
region as that of another U.S. colony, West Germany.
And | assure our Japanese observer that in three
year’s residence on the island, | had many occasions
to see the Japanese flag flying in school yards and

over town halls.

Popular calls for full reversion to Japan began in

4 Nago in 1953 and culminated with the election of a com-

munist mayor of the capital city, Naha. The issue flares
semi-annually, but those most desperately displeased
have emigrated to Japan or Bolivia.

The removal of a village from its 300 year old site
for construction of a motor pool which was subsequently
never used when the Marines assumed command was
inexcusable, but any suggestion to give up the island
would be more so, amounting in effect to a decision to
forfeit Japan, South Korea, the Phillippines, and the
Teahouse of the August Moon to Red China.

Ft. Buckner is also the base for the Seventh

Fleet, which has been blockading Formosa since
June 1950 to embargo shipment of Nationalist troops
to the mainland. This blockade released 400,000
Chinese troops to fight against us in North Korea.
Do we hear anv calls to lift this blockade? | hardly
think we would feel free to remove defensive troops
from Florida if. Chinese or Soviet destroyers were
picketing between Havana and Key West. This dif-
ference in attitude explains the presence of U.S.
missile sites on foreign soil.

World opinion is assuredly more open-minded about
such matters than we, but unfortunately, no more open-
eyed and informed than the average American. Before
resigning hysterically at the gruesome possibility of war,
we should consider its probability. Probability, I believe,
has something to do with past performance, in which the
Soviets have been amazingly consistent and more rational

than we want to admit.

The “New Concensus” of U.S. opinion (i.e. liberal)
may, as claimed by Chester Bowles (The Coming Political
Breakthrough), hold the solution, but its validity in parts
of the world which do not share his moral assumptions

may be questioned. World

opinion may wash out na-

tionalistic logs, but to realise any sort of lasting interna-
tional order through a mere negation of nationalism is
to expect rather much from eye wash. The bar to whom
we appeal will have to be of higher instance than World

Public Opinion.

__LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Angolan Atrocities Necessitate Portugese Retaliation

ugese army chopped down na-
tive prisoners wholesale, need
qualification.

The Salazer distatorship is
an exceedingly mild one by
contemporary standards, and
his governments policy in
their nasty little colony is to
be highly commended. For the
Angolan rebels to be consid-
ered “freedom fighters” is to
make mockery of a noble
term. They are tittle more
than animals, savages, and
bandits whose crimes make
the Mau-Mau look absolutely
clvilized.

These rebels have been pic-
tured in this country as ideal-
ists and patriots. Little has been
told about their methods of
fighting: about the planters who
were forced to watch their chil-
dren fed into buzz saws; about
the women who were raped to
death; about the men castrated
and otherwise mutilated and
then turned loose in the jungle
to die hideous deaths; about the

men whose eye-lids were sliced
off and then turned loose to die
in terrible agony as the light
got to work on their nerves...
the list of crimes is among the
most foul and excuseless of this
century—a dubious honor.

To call these barbarians “free-
dom fighters” was an outright
distortion. I have listed only a
portion of their atrocities.

Against such savagery, swift
and massive retaliation is the
only answer. The mass bomb-
ings, deportations and execu-
tions may not make pleasant
reading either. But they have
worked. The rebellion, thank
God, is now only a minor, sput-
tering ugliness, and no real
threat. Respect for the black
man is a fine thing and one
which the white peoples must
learn if they are to survive—
but there are limits.

Dear Editor:

Now that Homecoming has
come and past, I feel that we
should stop and evaluate the
LF.C.'s concerts. Last year they
managed to have four very good
concerts. This year they can
only have three good ones, for
the first was very poor. What
is the cause of this?

The 5.F.C. told us that its
booking agent had been un-
able to get the Four Fresh-
men to follow through and
sign their contract. Why? |
really don’t believe that it
was money problems. If there
is @ guarantee in the contract,
the deposit does not have to
be that great. At least, it does
not seem like it would to me.
I feel that the LF.C. should

a budget which should not call
for more than a thousand dol-
lars per fraternity, and second-
ly, they should begin in advance
to arrange their concerts so
that the best entertainment at
the level which the budget al-
lows will not be busy.

I feel that if the LF.C. be-
came organized much better
than it is now, they can continue
the fine concerts that have been
coming to Davidson in the past.

Dear Editor:

Those who listened to Dr. E.
A. Patterson's extravagant
speech on the UN last week in
Charlotte might find it interest-
ing to see this organization as
it is seen from a neutral point
of view.

At its conception, the UN was
meant to be an open forum of
world debate and an arena for
cooperation between the world’s
great powers. These intentions
were most admirable. This good
spirit, however, did not last for
more than a very short time.
Today the United Nations has
developed into a labyrinth of
vetos, deadlocks and intrigues.

The delegates, who meet
daily, have so much to say
about nothing and so many
subtle accusations against
each other that a spectator in
the General Assembly might
very well exclaim with A. E.
Housman: “Terrence; this is
stupid stuffi” All the seme,
let us hope that it is not just
a matter of time until they
spend their sessions drinking
beer instead of “negotiating.”

What can we do about this

ap <*2G oll ao two things in order to guar- confusion? Maybe not very

antee the fraternities what they
pay for. The first is to approve

much. But we can try. A few
neutral countries do their best

to keep their big brothers from
blowing up the world. Now and
then a small country, like Swed-
en or Ireland, can come up with
an idea of some kind. Usually,
though, that does not do very
much good. Why? Because some
of the strong powers with the
right to veto a decision (i.e. the
U.S. or Nationalist China) inter-
prete the idea and the situation
differently from other equally
strong powers (i.e. the Soviet
Union).

Both these interpretations,
however, may be less accurate
than those made by a third
group. This group consists of a
few countries which are regard-
ed very insignificant and do not
even have the right to vote (e.g.
Monaco or Red China). They
might be able to grasp the idea,
but so what? They can not do
a thing.

All the while the five sages
in the Security Counst! talk
refined distinguished words
that maybe only the speaker
understends. This might be a
way to avoid making the lis-
teners nervous. But it is not
very efficient when they want
to make a point, if they ever
want to make a point, of
course.

We think that our delegates
now and then manage to accom-
plish something in the work for
peace. They can do this because
Sweden is a neutral country.
Both sides have a certain a-
mount of confidence in them.
If the great powers listen for a
minute or two to our voice, al-
though it might not sound like
poetry, and give us some, albeit
condescending consideration, we
think that our work was worth-
while and that we have reached
our goal, i.e. conveyed some
constructive ideas to those who
have great power in their hands.
