Question of
The Week

To show that Davidson men have
ideas about something more than
local topics, our question of the
week is again one of national in-
terest. As our position as a nation
at pedce grows more and more pre-
carious, we should be interested
in keeping peace if that is what
we want. The question is,

What should be our attitude to-
ward the present European war?

UY “Ey

England not only

struction, but us as well. That
they are fighting our war. There-
fore, I believe that we should give
them all the aid that we possibly

pay

Jim_Hogg, Senior:

Frankly I disagree with the state-
ment that England is fighting our
war for us. I do believe that they
are fighting for what we believe
is right, but there is a vast dif-
ference. To start with we are not
prepared for war, so why ‘commit
ourselves and suffer the fate
France? On the other hand we
should proceed wholeheartedly with
our defense program and make
our country safe for the ideals

‘that. we believe today and to pro- |

tect our future but we cannot hope

for this when we are not prepared.
—>o—

John McCrea, Spphomore:

First of all, the people of the
United States should learn to ana-
lyze the war situation without pre-
judices and without being influ-
enced by lop-sided sources. We
shouldn't, however, get to the point
where we think that everything we
read or hear is propaganda. From
this clear, broadminded viewpoint,
we should do everything in our
power to stay out of the war
long as we do not sacrifice any of
our liberties or ideals, If these are
at stake, we should be prepared to
fight the last man protect

them.

Clarence McArthur, Sophomore:

It is quite evident that our posi-
tion should by with the democra-
cies in the European war. This is
only a natural consequence when
we realize that we are always proud
to call our own United States the
greatest and most influential de-
mocracy in the world. The question
then arises as to how much shall
we help them, if at all. Our aid to
Great Britain should be in propor-
tion to her need and our ability to
aid her.

oe
Bill McLauchlin, Junior:

The more I look at this war, the
more convinced I become that this
is a war which is being carried on
by pagans who have only selfish
interests in man and no regard for
his life or his happiness. This creed
has nothing in common with Chris-
tianity and thus nothing in com-
mon with my beliefs. I do not be-
lieve that-to-take life-is~Christiany
but neither am I in favor of losing
that precious freedom of thought
and religion for which my and your
forefathers fought and died,

When I see that America and the
things she stands for are in dan-
ger of disappearing into the chan-
nels of greed and paganism which
are being established and enlarged
by the dictatorships, when these
things pierce my vision, I deem it
wise to fight, and to fight to win
that our land and its ideals may
continue to be a priceless heritage
for posterity. From my side of the
box, it would only be foolish to do
other than to fight.

for us to give it a great deal of

since been so fed up with war talk
that we fail to experience the ‘slight.
