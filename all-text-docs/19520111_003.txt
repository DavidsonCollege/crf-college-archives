In the only ‘post-
season, post-bowl, post-
everything game of the
football year, Davidson
has been contacted and
asked to play Montana

annual “Futility Bow!
to be held in Death Val-
ley before a non-paying
gate of possibly no peo-
ple, says Deke Houlgate
in a UP article datelined
Los Angeles and printed
in several large Pacific
Coast papers as well as
the Honolulu papers.
Deke says he picked

By DICK LILES
the two teams ‘‘because they never went anywhere during the
regular season and now need a trip.’ The one to Death Valley
would be a good trip for both, he says.

GA. TECH NEARLY WRECKS PLAN

‘There was never any question of Davidson's tight to the
nomination until Coach Crowell Little's eleven roared into action
at the end of the season and held Georgia Tech to a 7 to 34
count.’? Montana was a doubtful starter because of scason vic-
tories over New Mexico and Montana State. but clinched the bid
with a rousing defeat at the hands of Washington State by 10 to
47.

“To win the ‘honor’, Houlgate continued, “‘the teams
have to play nationally-ranked opponents and have to lose a few
of them.” The game -will be sanctioned by the NCAA and will
be broadcast by the DVBC (Death Valley Broadcasting Co.)
and will be televised, but until release date, all bids had not been
received and so the network has not been received and so the
network has not been announced.

We are glad to see that Davidson is getting nation-
wide publicity, but are. of the opinion that it would
certainly be futile for the Wildcats to enter a bowl
game if for no other reason than the fact that ‘since
the conference has outlawed them, Davidson would be
put on probation with Maryland and Clemson and
end up by playing each of the above teams along with
a rather steep schedule.

NEW SCHEDULE ANNOUNCED

Elsewhere on the page will be seen the story of the new
grid schedule, which is one of the best in recent years. Although
there is some argument ‘‘that since we’ re getting licked, we might
as well be licked by the best teams” (Georgia Tech, W. and L.,
etc.), the fact still remains that we've been playing clear out of
our class and should stick to schools that are nearer our size or
our athletic policy.

The Harvard game ts an innovation which should
prove interesting enough. Harvard shouldn't be any
tougher than one of the small schools of the SC, and
they brag of the fact that they don't ‘subsidize’ ath-
letes. Interesting, because for so many years the Ivy
Leaguers have somewhat isolated themselves and here
in the South, we have no idea of the comparative
strength of the Southern and Ivy.

The return of Furman into the fold was welcomed and
the word is that they have begun a de-emphasis on football be-
cause of the extremely high cost of maintaining their newly-set-
up program. However, what happened to Lenoir-Rhyne? There
seemed to be a seed of rivalry already sprouting between the
two schools after only one game—something you don’t see much
of at Davidson lately. There were more people in the visitor's
stands that rainy night than in our own. Although it is some-
what lowering ourselves to play the North State teams, it did
look like a wholesome thing since the schools are so close and
either game, here or there, would draw crowds and the spirit.

SWIMMERS START STRONG

Coach Dick Redding’s Catfish did themselves proud last
weekend by drowning the South Carolina dolphins in the open-
ing swim meet. It seems phenomenal how after only two years,
the swim team has taken its place in the Southern Conference
and although Carolina and State loom ahead, still nothing can
be taken from the boys in the pool and the progress they’ ve made.

Two names were outstanding by their absence in the meet
results, Ray and Pepper, but some new ones loomed brightly
as ever. Ed Stuart, Al Ormond, and Aubrey Miree are some
compartive newcomers although Stuart was a freshman swim-
mer last year and Miree saw action two years ago. Ormond,
however, is a frosh with lots of promise for the Cats.

“B” TEAM HOT ON COURTS

1 One of the teams that has been getting little or no at-
tention is our Jayvee basketball squad which has been moving
on at a terrific pace these last two weeks. In fact the Wildkittens
are undefeated this season and although they haven't met any of
the ‘"B” teams of the other Southern Conference schools, they
have met Gardner-Webb and two good high school aggregations
this past week.

The boys usually start about 6:15 when at home and so
the attendance has been sparse at the games, but they have proven
to be very exciting at times. They are ably coached by Tom
Fetzer, who is doing a wonderful job as a tutor.

EX-GLOBETROTTER LEADS SCORING

Buddy Brown of Charlotte, better known to the basketball 3

ring as “Goose” seems to be showing the most promise of the
yearlings on the team. Jim Faucette and Mike Hadge also are
doing a good job along with last year’s ace from the frosh squad,
Eddie Adams. Brown is the high scorer at center while the two’
guards are Hadge and Adams. Faucette and Scott Reams round
out the first team at forwards.

Coach Fetzer reports that he is trying to get a game with
the JV’s from his Alma Mater, Wake Forest, when the varsity
squads meet, but that nothing could be worked out satisfactorily
with the teams-of Carolina, Duke, etc. At any rate the Kittens
have several more games on tap this year and are shooting for
that undefeated season.

Fraternity League Gets Fast Start

KS Fast, Potent;
Sigma Chis Sharp
In Early Games

By WALLACE ABBOTT

This year’s interfrat basketball
season got off to a fast start, as
all 12 teams in the league played
games in the first three days of
this week. Obviously from. the six
games played there are that many
teams that came out on top, and
thereby are tied for first place.
Among the stronger teams around
the loop as seen in action by this
writer this week are the Kappa
Sigs, KAs, Sigma Chis and Pikas.

The Kappa Sigs, who scored
44 points in their first outing,
possess a wealth of talent, both
in newcomers and returnees
from last year, and should
thereby rank high up in the
final standings. Among their
more seasoned performers are

Jim Sloan, Eric Clark, Ham

Wade and George Lippard.

The freshmen starters seem to

be mainly Floyu Feeney and

Corky Clark.

George King and Lefty Vance,
both former varsity squad members
are leading the strong KA team in.
to action. Both of them showed
up well, as they scored 13 and 15
points, respectively in the KA's
$5.29 victory over the SAE’s. Also
aiding in the scoring parade was
Skidmore who tossed in 13 points.

The Sigma Chis boast almost
the same team that won last
year's. championship. Among
the starters are Paul Eastman,

Bert Downs, Tyler Berry and

Phil Blatt. Although they went

through last year’s season un-

defeated, it looks as if they
will have a little harder time
repeating that feat this year.

The Pikas suffered a real blow
in the loss of Al Gaither, one of
last year’s All-Fraternity players.
However, on hand to take Al's
place are Fields and Beardsley, who
both saw a lot of action Tuesday
night in the Pikas first game.

At the present time these teams
look like the leading contenders in

the basketball race for this year.

However, as you all know, any
one of the other eight teams are
capable of coming out on top. So
we'll wait until a few more weeks
have passed and see how things go
then.

° AL ORMOND

By TAD CURRIE
When the Davidson College Cat-
fish left Columbia, S.C., last Satur.
day night, they left a slightly dazed
and definitely. beaten USC swim-

!ming team wondering what had hit

them. The answer was simple, it
was a determined and steadily im.
proving Davidson team that cut the
Gamecock swimmers down to size
by winning the first meet of the
season by a 48 to 35 point count.

At the beginning of the sea-
son the number one question
around the tank in Johnston
Gym was, “Who will take Bill
Ray and Ray Cunningham's
place?” After the meet Satur.
day night it looked as if the
answer to that question had
been found in the person of a
lanky Yankee, Al Ormond, In
his firet real collegiate meet
Al won the Individual Medley
and came in second in both the
220 and 440, a good record in
anybody’s book,

This Saturday the wrestling team
goes down to Atlanta to meet
Emory University’ in the second
match of the year. After having
dropped a very close match to the
University of North Carolina, 20.15,
the Wildcats will be looking for a
win. Coach Parker says the two
teams will be closely matched and
Davidson has about a 50-50 chance.

The starters for the Cats are as
follows:

123—Bobby Joe Key.
130—Johnny Guiton.
137—Captain Gene Craven.
147—Don Reed or Morley Vail.
157—Angus Andrews,
167—Nabbie Armfield.

177—Bill McElveen.
HeavyWt.—Bill McNeely.

The strength of the Wildcats
lies in such veteran performers
as Captain Gene Craven, John.
ny Guiton, Morley Vail, and
Bill McNeely, Gene looks like

_ he is headed for his best year
yet and there is a good possi-
bility that he will go through
the season with.a clean slate.
He is recognized as one of the
best wrestlers in the Southern
Conference now. After winning
the AAU meet and placing
third in the Southern Confer.
ence tournament, don’t be sur-

prised if Davidson has a first
place conference champion in its
midst at the end of the season.

There are also promising reserves
up from the Freshman class. John-
ny Byxton is one of them who has
been doing very well this week.
After only three days of practice
he was in there with the best of
them and is almost sure to be a
starter before the end of the sea-
son. Peter Peck will be missed,
however, as he was forced to quit
due to scholastic difficulties.

Friday week marks the date of
the encounter: with the Wolfpack
of N. C. State. It will take place
after the VPI basketball game. All
in all, it looks like a big year for
wrestling here at Davidson.
