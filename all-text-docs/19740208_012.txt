The Davidsonian

In Defense Of A Tormented Dylan

By JOE EARLE
Associate Editor

Critics of pop music are, for
anyone who hasn’t noticed
lately, professional conmen.

We (and I include myself
among these august ranks
only because I have been paid
for my talerits, not because
those talents are particularly
noteworthy) have a rather
nasty habit of assuming truth
to be that which we want it to

The Dylan phenominon is
an amazing sidelight to rock.
His music has always been in
the mainstream ; on vinyl] he is

a pacesetter.

But out of the studio, Dylan
is more than another
writer/singer/rocker. I know
as well as anyone else his
mythical position, his place in
our culture; he has meant as
much as me as anyone that I
have not known intimately
and as much as some I have.
That must be true of every
self-styled rock critic over 19.

The problem with this at-
titude is that it denies Dylan

make lousy demigods. They
can always change their
minds.

For years, Dylan played
with the myth. He lived up to
our expectation. He defined us
as “outlaws”, he gave us
music you could enjoy in any

amazing. He is universal, and
a sizeable chunk of those of us
who grew up with (or even
through) him. I still know a
friend I can identify with
every portrait painted in
“Just Like Tom Thumbs
Blues’’ and ‘‘Desolation
Row’”’.

' Street’. He said his ‘‘critical

perhaps. We simply know he is
not with us and we feel sold
out.

Which brings us back to
“Dylan’’. The fight here is the
same fight that started with
“Self Portrait’? in 1970. He
isn’t doing what we want him
to; we feel sold out.

Fine. Think that if you want.
I still like it.

What these things mean to
me is that Dylan is changing,
probably has been all along,
and no longer cares whether
we come along on his trip or
not.

In a time when everyone
from Elton John to the Band is
marking time with a product
keyed around music they
played 10 or 15 years ago, why
can’t Dylan have a little fun
too? That’s the essential
quality of both ‘‘Self Portrait”
and “Dylan’’~they're music
just for fun.

Prophets, I suppose, are not
allowed to enjoy themselves.

We professional conmen
have a vested interest in
determining the truth. It
keeps us working. We take
Dylan and categorize his
genius. We determine a niche
for him.

Arecord like ‘“‘Dylan’’ blows
that niche right out of our wall
and makes us look silly.

Maybe the difference is best
summed up by Steve Simel’s

opinion’’ was that the album
was a regression, but his
‘shonest opinion” was that he
loved it. I guess that’s how far

we've degenerated.

Perhaps critical response to
“Dylan” is to turn off the
stereo and say ‘Bob, forgive
us, we know not what you do.”’
I only know that my honest
response is to get up and
flamenco dance around the
room.

“Dylan may not be as good
as “Blonde on Blonde”’ or
“Highway 61’, but nothing
else is these days, either. You
look for the old Dylan, I’m
gonna dance around the room.
