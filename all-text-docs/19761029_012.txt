Carnegie evolves into Guest House

By PAT HICKERT
Staff Writer

“It sure isn’t like any of the other
residences on campus”’ one might say
upon wandering into Carnegie Guest
House; and, if someone is expecting
anything the likes of the old tempo-
rary union he is really in for a
surprise.

The recently renovated building is
now brightly lit, gaily colored, and
beautifully furnished. Much of the
furniture is from the Horton estate,
including a large eight fold chinese
decorated screen displayed in the
foyer. Done in the 18th century, the
laquer screen portrays a group of
people standing in a pavilion.

Also from the Horton collection is a
stately (90” tall) oriental style desk,
dating from the early 18th century. It
is placed in the lounge on the first
floor.

Many other magnificent antiques
from the Horton collection are ar-
ranged throughout the house includ-
ing several valuable Chippendale
pieces.

Janie French, guest house manag-
er; has her office in the Marcia Bell
Mitchell room, which. has been fur-
nished with pieces from the Mitchell
estate. Upstairs are the bedrooms, all
of which have separate bathrooms.
The plumbing forthe bathrooms and
the ductwork for the air conditioning/
heating system required the first floor
ceiling to be lowered. an

Aside from this lowering and the
installation of a fireproof stairway,
the floorplan and structure remains
essentially the same us when the
Union occupied this building. Most of
the work involved restoring, refinish-
ing and updating the structure.

The exterior looks basically the
same as when it was built in 1910. The
basement of Carnegie was remodeled

to accomodate twelve upperclass wo-
men in six rooms.
The prices here are quite reason-

able, especially considering the luxu-~

rious surroundings. Most of the
rooms are $12 a night for a single, and
$15 a night for a double, and business
has been for the most part quite good.
During homecoming weekend the

Guest House hosted two large recep- |

tions and all the rooms were rented.

French suggested that reservations
be made in advance, especially since
there is no staff on duty at night.
Reservations may be made during |
regular office hours 8:30 to 5: 00
Monday through Friday.

Carnegie Guest House is intended
to be a showcase for Davidson College
so the‘college spared no espense.

According to Robert Currie, business .

manager, the cost of renovating the
guest house was approximately
200,000.

The present grandeur of Carnegie
Guest House was far beyond even the
wildest expectations of the 150 or so
people that gathered on the evening of
Sept. 12, 1910 to dedicate the first
library building at Davidson College,
Carnegie Library. According to an
article in the charlotte observer the
affair ‘‘was by far and away the most
elaborate ever seen here.”

The entire building was built with
$20,000 donated by Mr. Andrew
Carnegie in 1909. It is amazing when
one compares the cost of building the
library to the cost of remodeling it,
and it is also interesting to note that
during that time span, the overdue
book fine of five cents a day has
remained stable.

The building served Davidson as a
library for 30 years, until 1921, when
Old Chambers burned to the ground;
then the offices of the college were
housed in the basement of Carnegie.

THE ANDREW CARNEGIE LIBRARY, ‘built in

1910, has resumed its status as the college
Guest House.

By 1941, Davidson had outgrown
the library. The president of the
college at the time, Dr. John
Cunningham, wanted a place to
entertain potential benefactors of
Davidson, so he had the library
remodeled into a guest house, which
was quite fancy for the time. Appar-
ently his plan worked because during
his tenure as president, Dr.
Cunningham increased the endow-
ment of Davidson from 3 million
dollars to 9 million dollars.

' The guest house was also the
headquarters for the Davidson Col-
lege YMCA and since the college was
without-a union, the YMCA hosted
many functions in the Carnegie
building. The YMCA stayed in the
guest house until 1952, when it moved

-Steve Lewis

to the student union.

By 1972 the guest house was
showing signs of wear, so the college
decided to convert the building into a
temporary student union, since the
old union was being torn down to
make room for The E.H. Little
Library. During the three years
Carnegie served as the Union David-
son recognized its need for a guest
house so as soon as the union moved
into its new headquarters in the
summer of 1975 rennovation began.

Durnig 1976 commencement, some
sixty-seven years after the first brick
was laid, and after serving the college
as a library, college office, guest
house, YMCA headquarters, and
student union Carnegie again opened
its door as The College Guest House..
