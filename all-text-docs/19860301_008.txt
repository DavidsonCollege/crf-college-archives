Rdcently it has come to my attention,
reading in the media, the following prob-
lem has been put forth to Dr. Bliss and I
— dilemma as to whether to utilize
the Kihg’s English in a proper manner so
to accurately convey one’s feelings to-
ward dnother person, thing, whatever, in
a cleat and concise (even terse) Fashion
withoyt the hindrance of convoluted
phraseplogy or some such misuse of our
Beloved verbiage.

I’rmp now taken aback to the days of

Gutteral utterances

my younger Years as I played tee-ball.
(Damn — If I could hit the ball off the
Tee. My girl started to like the star of the
team. Damn — If I could only catch. Be-
cause of this, I switched to mental sports.
Damn — If only I could Write.)

I gave up sports because I knew that
aesthetic things were my game — like
dandelions . . . the smell of a freshly-
picked flower teaches me the beauty in
nature (and man). Human beauty is ex-
pressed through the nature of his writing
— So I therefore propose to put forth a
bill Saying that epitaphs should be con-
sisting of that which one has written his
entire life (especially those words which
are nothing but bull dung). My writings

would fill a sarcophagus.

In saying, “Damn — If only I could
Write,” and “My writings would fill a
Sarcophagus,” facetiousness, of course,
was my intention. This is; our, after all,
parody issue, and so therefore J can raise
my level of Licentiousness. On that same
vein, allow me to continue my comments
about the butchery of our Nation’s lan-
guage made by our Nation’s mode of
communication, T.V.

Television is naught but chewing
Gum for the eyes, Whilst reading exer-
cises one’s mental facilities. W. F. Bul-
key is of course the most aerobic of mod-
ern day writers, exercising the peruser’s
mind the Full extent of its gray matter.

George Willing, however lacks the style
of the great writer, whom I eternall
emulate. His clear, Mark Twainian style
of writing sets an example for we plebian
pencil-pushers. Willing’s eloquent
ramblings deserve no derision, but it is no
contest for the master of the mega-syl-
labic word, whose writings are as prolific
as his name suggests.

I invoke the muses here, so, they can
bring back the golden years of television.
Days when Milton Berle, “The Honey-
Mooners” and “The Little Rascals” ruled
the two-dimensional screen. T.V. sucks
now. As does the writing skill of most ev-
erybody!...
