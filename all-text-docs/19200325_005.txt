THE DAVIDSONIAN, March 25, 1920.

' Oh, I'd like to see the story

Of a girl who used no paint, ,

. Whose hair belonged to her alone,
As the cases mostly ain’t.

,Ah, yes the tale must picture her
‘With no artificial curl.

Oh, I'd like to see the story,

But I'd rather see the girl.

last Friday the ocean would soon be

You'll generally address him: jits all the same with you, Doctor,
“Shut up, you lunatic.” I'd rather have you operate on my

But if it be a maiden in it.”
Who tortures you this way,
“You sure are awful clever”
Is about all you’d say.

They came. We went. We saw.

They conquered.

A music-lovers club was ‘organ-
ized immediately after the concert
last week. Joe Walker, since he
counted the ballots, was of course
elected president. The purpose of
the club is to get front seats at all
musical entertainments held on the
hill, or rather stage of Shearer
Chapel.

This paragraph is inserted here
solely for the purpose of avoiding
the publication of something which
we do not desire to print, namely:
two items of verse together.

WATTS WATER CARNIVAL

Everything Comes Off Smimming-
ly, Knights of Bath Festivate.
Great Triumph for Wets.

“Watch Watts” makes, not only a
good headline for Bible class news,
but also an excellent admonition for
ali who are forced to pass near that

‘structure these days. The spring
drowning season has opened and
Watts did the uncorking when their
Water Carnival was pulled off last
_week, ; °
It was a case of uncivilized civil
war. Roommate would lean out of
,one window to soak someone on an
_inferior floor only to be coronated
iby Roommate no. 2 from another
window of the same room. It was
heartrending the way in which paper
bags were wasted. Local merchants
are expecting the prices of such ar-
ticles of warfare to rise as a result.

Henry Massey, the shrewd inven-
ter of the second floor, was the
brains of the conflict. With mirror-
scope and periscope he endeavored
to cope with his adversaries, but
since his hat was destroyed in the
opening moments it was of no avail.

Among those also present were
Captain Chink Wilkinson, the ace
supreme of pot shots. Tufts the
wielder of the 10 qt. bucket; Sloan,
the flashy freshman who lent tone to
the affair and others; Pap Askew
and Poetic Hawkins were in the re-
viewing stand.

As the new staff sees it:
“Ring out the false
Ring in the true.”
But we may remark :
“The order changeth, old things
giving place to new
Lest one good custom should cor-
rupt the world.

Do You.

I have loved you all the time,

jut now ‘Il love you all the more,
And 1 shall love you all the same.
Long may I love you all—you four.

Fresh: “I wanter light.”
J. Eris: “40 Watts?”
Fresh: “No, 40 Chambers.”

had no peers, when it was running
good. However, unfortunately,
Schenck was put out of the game at
the beginning of the season by in-
juries and was not able to re-enter
the game during the remainder of
the season. Despite this handicap,
the team showed Wonderful form at
times and as most of ‘the team will
be back next year, we may safely
hope to expect great things from it
in the future.

Considering the handicaps under
which he has worked this year, we
may very well congratulate Coach
Hengeveld for the team he has put
out.
