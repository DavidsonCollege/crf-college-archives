Gauntlet features home showdowns

By DANIEL Morz

Senior Staff Writer

Once again, coach Charlie
Slagle’s Wildcats will play one of
the toughest schedules in the nation
—aslate which features three home
games against ACC competition.

The Wildcats begin their regu-
lar season with a trip to Madison,
Wis., where they will face the 1995
NCAA champion Wisconsin Bad-

gers. They will also tangle with
Wisconsin-Milwaukee, which is
coming off a 13-4-3 campaign.

Davidson is set to participate
in a tournament Sept. 12-14 in
Greensboro, where they will battle
William & Mary, a national
quarterfinalist last year.

The Wildcats make a second
appearance in Greensboro later in
the season when they face regiorial
power UNCG, which is playing its
inaugural season as amember of the
Southern Conference...

“This is obviously our best
home schedule since the 1992 Final
Four season,” Slagle said. .

The Wildcats open play at
Richardson Field against UNCC,
who made the Final Four last De-
cember.

The Wildcats also host ACC
powers Duke and North Carolina,
and they have a date set with Wake
Forest during homecoming week-
end. :

Winning the conference tour-

NCAA play-in game, but with such
a powerful non-conference sched-

Julien is Dither for Wildcats

By Daniet Motz

Senior Staff Writer —

Phil Julien has been in this
postion before.

Whether it was when he played
for Oak Hill Academy, the Eastern

. Olympic Development team for six

years, or the Region I Olympic De-

- velopment squad, Julien has always
’ been the go-to guy.

With Robert Clarke — the 1995
Southern Conference Player of the

high-octane senior
represents the pri-
mary goal-scorer
for this year’s
|. squad.

Toe With six goals
Pi i | and five assists a
year ago, Julien’s numbers’ from
1996 make up more than half of the
returning point-scoring.

“Phil’s just a great offensive
player,” coach Charlie Slagle-said
last. week. “He’s got a powerful
shot and he can beat guys off the
dribble. :

“We believe that we have not
set unrealistic goals when we talk
about Phil scoring 15 goals, this
season.- He’s such an unselfish
player I’d like him to take advan-

_ tage of his opportunities and maybe

be a little more selfish.”

But Julien is reluctant to talk
Statistics or predict his scoring out-
put for this year. To him, being the
go-to guy means helping his team.
His opportunities will come.

“T think we’ ve got a-real bal-
anced team,” Julien said last week.

Year — gone, the

“If [help the other guys, the chances
to. score will come. I just wantto.do
my personal best, whether that is
goals, assists, or whatever.”

One of four captains, Julien is
yet again in a leadership role. And
like his performance on the field, it
is an area where he excels.

“Aside from his physical abil-
ity, players really look up to him as
a person,” Slagle said.

“TI enjoy leading the guys on

and off the field,” Julien said., “But
the guys on the team have been

doing so well that it has made our

(the captains’) job easy.”

As a scorer and leader, Julien
personifies the intensity of the re-
vamped Wildcats. -

After going abroad to Austra-

lia last spring — an experience that
put-soccer in perspective, he says—-
—Slagle reports that Julien samate
with unbridled optimism.
“While I was abroad, guys were
writing me and letting me know
how the program was going,” Julien
recalled. “It was really exciting.”

For Julien and the rest of the
Wildcats, 1997 marks a new’ sea-
son.

“Last year was disappointing
both for me and the team,” Julien .
said. “I felt like I started out well,
but I started fading when the team .
did.

“I really want to become more
consistent and do whatever it takes
to get Davidson back to that level of
being a top 20 team.”

Improved squad looks to surprise league

Laughter. |

That's what was heard last
week as the volleyball team pre-
pared for the upcoming season. But
this practice was far from fun and
games.

Aminute later, the players weré
back on the court diving to make the
tough dig and leaping up for the kill.
The dedication and hard work —
but also fun — were evident.

This is a true team. They aré
vocal, committed, supportive, and

very talented. “Practices are in-
tense and we are working very hard,”
setter/hitter Ginny Quis said.

The mix of a strong core of

returners and talented newcomers -

gives the Wildcats not only a tal-
ented team, but a very deep one as
well.

“Last year we did a lot of indi-
vidual technical training that we do
not have to do this year,” coach Lisa
Radford Marston said. “These la-
dies are very technically sound as a

_ result of the hard work everyone put.

in last fall and spring.”

The Wildcats are looking to
continue a recent pattern of con-
stant improvement — they: im-
proved in almost every statistical
category between: 1995 and 1996.

The 1996 group improved to
11-22 (including a 5-9 Southern
Conference finish) after posting an
8-25 mark the year before. Led by
Janet Duncan, who finished second
in the league in blocks with 137, the
Wildcats leaped from eighth in the
conference in blocking to second.

Quis was the only player in the.

Southern Conference to have four

triple-double performances.
Outside hitter Lois Ann

Bumgarner ranked fourth in the

conference in digs and led the team .

in kills, attempts, service aces, and
digs.

Outside hitter/middle blocker
Gina Lawrence ranked second on
the team in kills, hitting percentage,
digs, blocks and assists. She also
ranked among the top 10 in the
conference in digs.

“The ‘end of last year, espe-
cially the win over UTC (the even-
tual conference champion), gave us

Two talented freshmen, Mara
Mordini and Brooke Bentley, are
expected to contribute right away.
Katherine Lorenz, the Wildcats’
other top newcomer, is out for the
season after tearing her ACL early
in the preseason.

Still, the preseason rhetoric is
nothing but optimistic.

Duncan feels good about the
fact. that “the team has lots of depth’
as well as many versitile players.
We have people who have an atti-
tude to win.”

Radford Marston feels the
Wildcats are “solid at every posi-
tion as well as very supportive of
each other.”

She also recognizes “the im-
portance of the three senior leaders
who have very different playing
roles.”

Those leaders will be even more
important this year because the win-
ner of the conference tournament
will receive an automatic bid to the
NCAA tournament. In previous
years, the winner of the league tour-

. ney has had to.winaplay-in game in

order to advance. :

But, as she said, “Every year
there is also a suprise team, and I

feel we could be thatteam this year.”
