Cats seek unequaled season

By BARRY SACHTJEN

As the Davidson Wildcats
approach their home opener
withFordham, feelings of opti-
“mism run high among both
players and coaches. Marked by
a noticeable increase in both
leadership and confidence, this.
year’ 's team seems well justified
in their enthusiasm.

Early
Head Coach Ed Farrell
echoes these sent:ments by
pointing out that the large

number of qualified veterans ___

“makes us confident that, star-
ting in 1978, we are capable of
playing competently with any-
one on our schedule.”

“Overall talent on the squad
is improved, especially at the

skill positions. Several of these,

skill positions will be filled by

son’s experience ‘and a spring
practice behind tem, their im-
pact. should be considerable.”

There are a host of veterans
returning so that both the
offense and the defense will rest
on the efforts of familiar
with Coach Farrell's style of

, “Since we've all been
two years, we've got it (the
offense) We know what
_ ‘we rap do we have confi- -
dence in each other.”

*“People-wise. we should have a
great year. We have all the size
and strength we need. All that
remains to be seen is whether or
not we can play together. We
have to see a game situation to
see what we can do.”

Offense

Leading the array of talent is
the offensive backfield, which
Farrell feels is ‘‘reasonably
veteran.”’ Sophomore Alvin At-
kinson is an improved runner
with darting moves and break-
away’ speed. Halfback Craig
Pyles possesses excellent hands
and is known for his blocking
prowess.

Senior fullback Page Walley, a

bruising ball-carrier, needs only
227 yards to become the all-time
Davidson carreer rushing lea-
der, Farrell recognizes Walley’s
instrumental role in the Cat’s
success by lauding him as a
“proven player on whose capa-
bilities much of the offense. will

However, much of the ree-
ponsibility for the offensive
punch will be in the hands of
McCarthy, a starter for the last

Farrell believes the offensive
. line, isd by experienced players
as Dave Donaldson, Phil Toye,

year should open up even more
holes.”

With the veteran know-how
of both tight-ends Larry Crees
and Tom Trahey and the speed
of young wide-receivers Gifford
Piercy and John Porter, teams
will now be forced to show
respect for Davidson's passing .
attack, thus opening up the.
middle for the inside running
plays.

This will be augmented by
the marked improvement in

outside running. In particular,

Atkinson's speed should pro-
vide Davidson with an asset
which Walley feels will allow us

to have more ‘variety in our

plays.”

Defense ~

However, the Cat talent is
not dominated by the offense.
The stalwart defensive line an-
chored by the inside ttio of
Frank Fields, Mike Sheridan,
and Svend Pedersen should
provide numerous problems for

opposing offenses with their

strength and

Outside linebackers Barry
Cannon and Glen Echols have

Terrell Rhye end Gery Joe
Stokes combine swesome

and lateral movement.

In the secondary, Farrell
etates that the players compo-
sing the unit ave all fine athletes
with an éxesllent mix of speed

and defensive sayvy. These —
: defensive becks, Chris Bosist,
_ Landis Wade, Kevin Hanna and

Phil Gilbert are all expéqienced
end shouki disrupt many par
sing attempts.

Stokes related that the de-
fense has been working espe-
cially hard on ‘becoming more
aggressive, a sense which is not
easily taught by the coaches.”
Overall, the defensive unit ap-
pears very strong and should
fare well if everybody success-
fully carries out their assign-
iments.

The only facet of the Cats
game not handled. by an experi-
ences player is the kicking
game. However, several promi-
sing freshmen including Mike
Bass, Wayne Paymer and Gary
Sims could give the team a huge
lift with their exceptional abili-
ties sould their success in

practice extend to game situa-
tions.

Expectations . __

his year’s schedule consi-
dered “realistic, but challeng-
ing”’ by Farrell should provide a
mix of comparable teams as well
as some that will be somewhat
better or worse. However, even
with several weaker teams Far-
rell insists that Davidson “must
be careful every week and not

‘look past teams. We have the

potential to beat everybody.”

Should they fare well this

as Furman and Lehigh could be

a factor in gaining the Cats the — .

recognition necessary to land

_ & post-season playoff berth.

Sizing up the Wildcats first
game Farrell warns of a charged
up Fordham team. “On paper,
they are as good or better than
last year. We expect them to be

keyed up for a big year. They

beat Widener (division III

national champion last year)
and thought they sould’ bave
been in the playoffs last year.”

Farrell admits that in last
year’s game they were a bit
“appreheasive at first playing
a team in a higher division.”
_ Yet, they almost pulled the
* game out in the closing mi-

; nutes, and therefore could easi-
ly say “We could have beaten
Davidson.”

_ Stokes feels that this first
game could prove key for the
entire season. ‘‘We have to
lominate if we can. Jelling in
thie game as a unit would
really help us.” Harping on an
intangible pre-season apprehen-
sion Stokes added that ‘‘we
won't know exactly what we
have until we are in a game.

Walley also recognizes that
« “Fordham is a tough team that
* wants to hit, but we have a-
bettef program. If we execute

correctly the difference should —

tell.’”

Farrell noted that the princi-
ple difference in attitude be-
tween this year’s squad and last
lies not with morale, but*with
confidence. Specifically, being
not concerned about the ability
to perform.”

Therein lies the reason for
"a positive

Should Davidson play up to

expectations Farrell believes

“we will expect to win.”

Some of the players expres-
sed a strong desire to produce a

that “eight wins has never been.
, done here.” Perliaps McCarthy
summed up best the deserved
optimism of the Wildcats as
they begin what could be more
than just a winning season.

“If we stay healthy, we have
a-chance of being the winning-
est team in Davidson history.”
