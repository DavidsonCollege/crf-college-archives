FIGHT ’EM WILDCATS -- WE ARE WITH YOU!

CAT TRAX

As They Follow the Red and
Black

By Zeb V. Long, Jr.

Well, it is all over now, and there’s no
use talking about what might have hap-
pened had thé Wildcats been able to con-
trol Carolina’s passes. The truth is that
Davidson was overpowered by sheer re-
serve strength and not by more fight .or

way you look at it.

We will always remember that
glorious first half. Never have we
seen a team play more magnifi-
cently against tremendous odds
than did the Wildcats, and never
have we seen a more perfect of-
fensive than the one which netted
Davidson’s touchdown. Right
along with the team played the
students, alumni, faculty, janitors
and everybody concerned for Da-
vidson. It was a shouting, wildly
enthusisastic throng that watched
the Cats do battle to their super-
ior foes.

It took Carolina just exactly five drives

was hard to lose by such a score after
such a great scrap, but Davidson, looked
about the best in such a defeat that any
team could have looked. It was really a
case of about 15 Davidson men playing
30 Tar Heels, one as good as another.
Carolina has the stuff for a much greater
team than she has, in our humble opinion.

Thad Brock snatched passes in
miraculous fashion, and his hard
defensive game cut down many
potential scores for the visitors.
B.b Kell, as is his custom these
days, ran and passed in approved
style, and the Mississippi lad was
responsible for most of the local
gains. It looks as if Mr. Walter
Fraley is trying to help the plaster
cast manufacturers, judging from
the way this little gentleman was
busting them Saturday. Piggy
Harper came through with his best
year as he knifed through on nu-
merous occasions to stop the Tar
Heel backs in their tracks.

In spite of close observance, we did not
notice much brilliance on the part of Caro-
lina’s luminary, Harry Schwartz. To be
sure he got his part of the tackles, but his
running mate, Ray Farris, far outshone
him. Farris was ‘hitting them on every
other play. His fine work held the Wild-
cats in check many, many times.

The Wildcats are bending every;

effort to climax the season with a

win over Duke. We keep on feel-

ing that they are due to spill some-
body around here, so it stands to
reason that it must be Duke. Sam

Buie and his passes are going to

prove another thorn in the side,

but they can be stopped. That

Thanksgiving Day crowd at Dur-

tham is going to see a battle that

they will remember a long time.

We would pick*the Blue Devils to whip
Carolina and cop the championship if it
were not for Carolina’s 35-year winning
streak over the Methodists. That streak
seems to be an eternal jinx to the Duke
boys. It is hard to dope.

The Wildkittens are venturing
into the mountains this week-end,
with the intention of bringing back
something more than moonshine
and bad colds. They should beat
Asheville High without very much
trouble. It seems to us that five
games a year is too few for the
yearlings. Seven or eight would
give some much needed training.

Two letter men out for basketball.
Such is the fact which faces Younger as
the cage season draws on, Pritchett and
Calhoun are the experienced troopers, and
their ranks will have to be greatly aug-
mented before a winning combination can
be placed on the floor. Quite a bit of
promising material is in sight from last
years’ frosh team and from the present
class fives.

“Girls were harder to kiss in your day,
weren't they, grandpa?”

“Mebbe, mebbe,” ventured the old gen-
tleman, “but it wasn’t so blame danger-
ous. The old parlor sofa wouldn't smash
into a tree about that time.’—The Betcon.
