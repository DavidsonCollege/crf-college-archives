~ COOKING

WITH RACHEL |

Take your
palette to the
Mediterranean

by Rachel Newcomb
The best shish kebabs I’ve
ever had were at a hotel on the
edge of the Sahara desert at about
11 in the evening. Maybe it was
the atmosphere that made them
taste so good, or maybe it was the
wine, ‘ubiquitously named Les
Vieux Papes (The Old Pope), but
I think I’ve found the recipe to
recreate those flavors. You can
do something more interesting
with shish kebabs than simply
skewering and grilling them.
Variations on this recipe can be
found all over the Middle East,
and the savory marinade makes
them among the best shish kebabs
you'll ever taste. Impress your
friends by whipping this easy
recipe out for dinner, or for spe-
cial occasions.
Broiled Skewered Beef
(Lamb may be substituted)

1 large onion, sliced into rings

2 tablespoons olive oil
4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons salt

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black
pepper

2 pounds lean boneless beef, cut
into cubes
Cherry tomatoes, as many as de-
sired
Green pepper

2 tablespoons heavy cream

Drop the onion rings into a
deep bowl and sprinkle them with
the olive oil, lemon juice, salt,
and pepper. Add the beef and turn
the pieces about with a spoon to
coat them well. Marinate at room
temperature forat least two hours,
orin the refrigerator for four hours,
turning meat occasionally.

You can cook this either ona
grill or in a broiler pan with the
broiler setting on. With their little
slats and one inch of space be-
neath, broiler pans allow juices
from the meat to drip into the pan
while cooking. Make sure the
pan sits on the lowest possible
rackin the oven, about four inches
from the heat source.

Take the beef from the mari-
nade and string on skewers, alter-
nating with onions, cherry toma-
toes, and ‘green pepper pieces.
Brush the meatevenly on all sides
with the cream. Broil four inches
from heat, turning skewers occa-

‘sionally, until the vegetables
brown richly and the beef is done
to your taste.

For mediumrare, allow about
10 minutes; for well done, cook a
few minutes more. Check after
eight minutes just to be sure, and
cut open the meat to see how it’s
doing in the middle. Be careful
not to overcook the vegetables;
you may need to take them out
earlier if they look finished. Serve

. over a bed of couscous or rice and

enjoy.

Sex romps through American
culture like a gigolo on the job Itis
everywhere, sheathed in the pro-
tective latex of the media, teasing
us relentlessly, until we beg for
satisfaction, until we wish for the
fantasies that enter us again and
again every day to actualize, to
arise in solid form and gratify us.

But this rarely happens. The

SEX _

The Davidsonian responds to the University of Chicago survey

sexual episodes we witness on the
screen are of less substance than
the spray of electrons that make up
the images. They are edifices
erected by the imagination and
thrust upon us—a rape of unreal-
ity. “What if,” asks our imagina-
tion, “I lived at Melrose Place?
My sex life would be so exciting.”
True. According to Entertainment
Weekly, a woman living at Melrose

Place would have had 5 sexual
partners since July of 1992.

. Is this how Americans live—
vamps of the night, destined to
spend eternity sliding into one bed
after another? According to the
recent report from researchers
based at the University of Chi-
cago, absolutely not. The results,
to be published as The Social Or-
ganization of Sexuality by the Uni-

versity of Chicago Press, indicate
acold-shower America, where the
denizens discreetly sip their coffee
and watch other people have sex
on the television.

The results shine a harsh and
blinding light on the intimate prac-
tices of We, the people. Prone to

Heathen Valley investigates Christianity in Appalachia

By Jacob Abraham

Try it someday. Find a good
backroad and follow it into the
hills of Appalachia. Drive past
the college towns, the middle-
class suburbs, the shopping
centers, and fast-food joints.
Leave behind every obvious sign
of civilization, and you will still
find two things: churches and
people. A native of Boone,
North Carolina, Romulus Linney

knows about the people of the
Appalachian mountain area, and
he knows about the tremendous

influence of Christianity. In
Heathen Valley, he takes us
back to a time when the civiliz-
ing force of Christianity had not
yet penetrated the backwoods.

The play describes what happens —

when a young idealist with a
strong sense of faith ventures
into a town full of primitive,

violent, and superstitious people.
Written by one of America’s
foremost contemporary play-
wrights, Heathen Valley has
won several awards and enjoyed
successful runs in regional
theaters across the country.
Director Ronnie Higdon also
worked on the 1990 production
of Heathen Valley, which won
the Helen Hayes Award for
Outstanding Production at The

Round House Theater in Wash-
ington, D.C. He also handles the
scenery and lighting design,
which he describes as “probably
the most complicated this
particular theater has ever seen.”
Leslie B. Rindoks provides the
costumes.

The cast includes a few
veterans of the Davidson stage as
well as some very talented
newcomers. Robert Ramsay, a
junior English major who most
recently performed in last

. Spring’s The Zoo Story, plays

the Episcopal Bishop of North
Carolina. The Bishop journeys
into “the valley that God forgot”
with a bold plan to establish a
mission there and teach the
people a more civilized way of
life through Christianity. He
brings with him only an orphan
boy and a janitor, who was born
in the valley and serves as a
guide. The janitor, Starns, is
played by Scott Lenhart, a senior
English major familiar with
audiences from his role in last
year’s Buried Child. Freshman
Ian Buchanan makes his
Davidson stage debut as Billy,
the orphan boy who narrates the
story.

The valley’s inhabitants are
alternately amusing and terrify-
