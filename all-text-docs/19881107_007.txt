Late ETSU field goal leads to Cat defeat:
Bucknell drops Cats 21-13 in conference game

By BRUCE NEWSOME

An East Tennessee State field goal with
1:44 left in the game vaulted the Bucca-
neers over the Wildcats in a hard fought 31-
28 victory Saturday night.

Coach Vic Gatto gave freshman Nicky
Crawford his first start and he got the of-
fense moving. He rushed for 119 yards and
two touchdowns while passing for 147
more yards.

After falling behind 21-14 at the half, the
Cats came back in the third quarter to tie the
game. Crawford provided the spark on the
drive with a 49-yard run. This run was the
longest of the season for Davidson.
Crawford capped off the drive with a 1-
yard run.

Early in the fourth quarter, Davidson
took the lead 28-21 and looked like they

might upset their Southern Conference
opponent. Wide receiver Horace Hamm
used his speed on a reverse play to go 41
yards for a touchdown. With 11:50 left in
the game, the Cats led by 7.

However, this lead did not even last one
minute. On the ensuing kickoff, Albert
Burt ran through the Davidson kickoff
coverage team for a 96-yard touchdown
retum. ETSU elected to kick the extra-
point and tie the game at 28-28. ;

ETSU won the game with a 19-yard field
goal with 1:44 left in the game to take the
lead. Davidson was unable to score on their
last possession, and the final score was 31-
28.

Last Saturday Davidson lost to the Buck-
nell Bison 21-13 in Lewisburg, Pennsylva-
nia. The loss dropped the Cats to 0-8 for the

season and 0-3 in conference play. The
Bison victory was only their second of the
season (Columbia being their other victim)
and their first conference victory.

The first quarter belonged to Bucknell.

On their opening possession they drove 58-

yards in nine plays. Their tailback went in
from 2-yards out for the score.

On their next possession, the Bison went
92-yards in 17 plays. This long drive was
capped by a short touchdown pass to the
tight end.

In the middle two quarters, Davidson re-
gained its composer and narrowed the
score. Brian Jacob connected on two field
goals from 20-yards and 32-yards. Full-
back Brian Kelly scored a second-quarter
touchdown on a 1-yard plunge.

At the end of the third quarter, it ap-

pearéd that the Cats might gain their first
victory of the season and their first Colo-
nial League victory ever. They had cut the
score to 14-13 and had the momentum.

However, a Davidson turnover led to a
late Bison touchdown. Mike Wright, who
had 98-yards rushing for the day, fumbled
late in the fourth quarter at the Davidson
18-yard line. This fumble is one of Many
untimely Davidson turnovers this season.

Five plays later, Bucknell got a 3-yard
touchdown pass to close-out the scoring at
21-13. This was the Bisons eighth straight
victory over Davidson and their 15th in the
18-game series.

The Cats end the season and try to break
a 12-game losing streak Saturday at home
against the Colonial League-leading
Lafayette Leopards.

By WHIT WILKS

Davidson closed out its 1988
season on a down note as the Cats
