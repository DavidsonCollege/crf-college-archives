N.C. to end ‘no deposit/no return’ ?

By TIM WHALEN
Staff Writer

This February the North Carolina
legislature will consider a bill proposing
that all beverage containers sold in the
state be returnable and carry a five cent
deposit.

The bill would allow all types of
beverage containers except those with
detachable pull-tabs to be sold.

The North Carolina Coalition for
Beverage Deposits (CBD), a citizen
group, is the major proponent of the

bill. Beer brewers and distributors and —

soft drink companies are the bill’s major
opponents.

According to the CBD, seven states—
Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Michigan,
Oregon, South Dakota, and Vermont —
have beverage container laws.

Rob Barnett, sales operations mana-
ger for Bealer Wholesale Inc., the local
distributor of Anhauser Busch beers,
said that the North Carolina legislature
has rejected a beverage container law
four times before, in 1973, 1975, 1977,
and 1979.

Barnett also pointed out that all 50
states have considered beverage con-
tainer laws, and that 43 states have
rejected them.

The CBD claims that roadside litter in
North Carolina will be significantly
reduced if the bill is passed. A 1979
study showed that roadside litter in

Michigan decreased by 40 percent the’

first year that state’s beverage container
law was in effect.

A summary of a study on the effects of
the Vermont beverage container law
reports ‘‘virtual elimination of roadside
litter, with a 56.6 percent reduction in
state effort for litter pick up.”

Barnett’s figures showed that Ore-
gon’s roadside litter decreased by only
ten percent after that state adopted its
beverage container law, and that most of
the decrease was due to increased state

Barnett said that current recycling
programs are very effective in reducing
litter, and that they will become even

Aluminum Company now recycles 67
percent of its aluminum cans nation-

wide. He said this is comparable to |

recycling rates in states that have
beverage container laws.

According to Barnett, the U.S. Brew-
ers- Association’s ‘‘Keep America Beau-
tiful” campaign is aimed at educating
consumers about recycling and making
recycling centers available. He further
mentioned that target recycling centers
are being set up by North Carolina
brewers in Greensboro and in Guilford
County.

The CBD’s “Deposit Legislation Fact
Sheet” claims that ‘‘Enough energy to
heat and cool 50,000 homes could be
saved each year if North Carolina
adopted deposit legislation.’’ The fact
sheet supports this claim by saying,
“Twenty aluminum cans can be recycled
-with the energy needed to make one from
scratch.” ’

Barnett disagreed that a beverage
container law would save energy. He
pointed out, that it takes five times more
water to wash and clean a used bottle
than it does to wash a new, nonreturn-
able bottle. He said that the distribution
system would use twice as much gasoline
since delivery trucks would have to make
a greater number of trips.

The CBD cites a 1975 study that
showed that a beverage container law
would result in a net increase of 600 jobs
in North Carolina. Their more recent
literature claims that North Carolina will
gain 1050 jobs if the law is passed.
Barnett conceded that jobs would be
produced by a beverage container law.
He speculated that his firm would need
double its present personnel, but he
questioned the value of the jobs that
would be created.

The CBD says, ‘‘Assuming that con-
version costs are spread over four years,
the average price per six-pack of beer or
soft drink is expected to decline by about
one-half cent.’’ According to the Ver-
mont summary, the state’s law resulted

‘“ ubstantial savings to consumers

containers which have been made avail-

passed.
able as a result of the deposit law. These

savings may be conservatively esti-.

mated at $60 per year for the typical
family using refillables.”’

Barnett’s figures showed that in
Michigan the price of a six-pack of beer,
adjusted for inflation and not including
the deposit, rose 36 cents after the
beverage container law was passed, and
that the price of a six-pack of soft drinks
rose 30 cents. He added that prices
would likely rise in North Carolina if a
beverage container law was passed
because of the increased costs in the
distribution system due to more em-
ployees and increased fuel consumption.

Barnett said the increase cost of.

beverages and the inconvenience of
returning containers would likely cause

~ many citizens of the 41 North Carolina

counties bordering other states to cross
the state border to buy beverages.
Citizens in states with beverage con-
tainer laws have done so, he said.
Consequently, he believes North Caro-
lina retailers and distributors would be
hurt if the law passes, and the state
would lose revenue from lost excise and
sales taxes.

The CBD said, ‘‘Oregon’s beverage-
related revenues did not decliné and with
proper planning neither will North
Carolina’s.’’ The CBD adds that the new

jobs created by the law will create new
income and sales tax revenue for the
state.

The Vermont report summary says
that after Vermont passed its beverage
container law, it experienced ‘‘sizeable
increases in beverage sales, with positive
impact on state revenue and the eco-
nomy.”’ The report added, ‘‘While the
increase may not be directly attributable
to the deposit law, the figures clearly
show that the law has not had a negative
effect.’’

Ruth Pittard of the Audio-Visual
Office and the Y Environmental Block
had a local campaign to raise support for
the bill.

They urge people to write to Governor
Hunt, Lieutenant Governor Green, and
the Mecklenberg County congressmen.

The Davidson Town Council has
passed a resolution favoring the bill
every time it has come up in the past,
according to Pittard.

Watson candidates aspire to educational adventures around the globe

By PETE GULYN
Staff Correspondent

What are you doing after
graduation? If you had the
chance to travel anywhere in the
world and to do almost any-
thing you wanted for one year,
all expenses paid, would you go
for it?

That chance is the Thomas J.
Watson Fellowship. Any senior
who wants to spend his first
year out of school abroad,
studying and traveling inde-
pendently, is eligible. The Wat-
son Foundation seeks students
with unusual potential, charac-
ter, maturity, creativity, and a
sense of leadership.

This year’s list of Davidson
applicants has already been
decided. Hugh Crenshaw, Mar-
tin McCoy, Christiane Moussal-
li and Newman Yeilding will be
notified of their status in April.

Although the application
deadline for next year’s fellow-
ship is in October, it is not too
early to think about applying
now. This is because submitting
a detailed, written proposal on a
special academic interest is an
‘essential prerequisite. This
year’s. applicants have offered
several colorful proposals.

Hugh Crenshaw, for exam-
ple, proposes to spend a year in
the southwest Pacific s dying

coral reef ecology.

He chose New Guinea, The
Hawaiian Eniwetok Atoll, and
the Great Barrier Reef off the
Australian coast as representa-
tive of the three major types of
reef formations, hoping to com-
pare their concentrations of
zooplankton.

- Martin McCoy would like to

survey the social and cultural
factors of Japan’s economic
miracle. Its transformation
from a feudal kingdom in the
19th century to the third largest
economic power in the world
today amazes McCoy.

As. he sees it, the Japanese
capacity for adapting to widely
changing social conditions,
their unique educational system
and their industrial labor poli-
cies relate to their public
growth. Surveys, question-
naires, and interviews of school
children, management, employ-
ees, and other segments of the
population would be used to
test varying hypotheses. Mc-
Coy. wants to find the main
ingredients for an Oriental soc-
iety’s success.

Since McCoy does not speak
Japanese, he might enroll in a
college or live with a Japanese
family for the first few months.
He has travelled widely on four
continents, but never in the

Orient. As an economics major
planning to enter business
school, he views human rela-
tions as the key to successful
management. Although the
Watson Foundation requires
only a summary of his activities
at the end of the year abroad,
McCoy hopes to make a larger,
more formal contribution to his
field.

Christiane Moussalli pro-
poses to study the Christian
minority in Egypt, focusing, in
her words, on the Christians’
‘‘perception of their religious
and national identity among the
Moslem people.’’ Her interest
centers on Cairo and Alexand-
ria. She would be aided by
contacts she has at the Ameri-
can University in Cairo and
with the Christian clergy there,

Moussalli was born in Cairo
of Christian parents who return-

ed to the States after Egyptian

industries were socialized in
1961. She has had a long-time
interest in Egyptian internal
affairs, and keeps abreast of
events through the Egyptian
press. She noted a lack of
written material on the thous-
and-year-old Christian popula-
tion, due in part to conflicts
between the Arabs and Jews.
Although she is a history
major, Moussalli plans a socio-
logical approach to how a
minority functions in Egypt. A
central problem in the Islamic
Code, which governs Egypt's
majority, is that its command-
ments apply only to other
Moslems. This leaves a moral
void in Christian-Moslem rela-
tions. The recent world resur-
gence of Moslem identity adds
to the dilemma, Moussalli said.
Newman Yeilding’s project
involves examining the health
care systems of four African

nations. It would be conducted
with the help of medical mis-
sionaries.

Cultural considerations
prompted Yeilding to choose
Tanzania, Kenya, Zaire, and
Nigeria because they embody
widely diverging ideals. Differ-
ent levels of socialization, in-
dustrialization, and urbaniza-
tion influence the medical prac-
tices there. Newman plans to
work in a mission after medical
school. His proposal would
prepare him for work in a
mission after internship.

Last year Carol Robinson ‘80
won a Watson fellowship. Rob-
inson is now in Munich studying
neuropsychology. Dean of Stu-
dents Will Terry, the College’s
advisor for the Fellowship,
urges interested juniors to ap-

. ply for next year’s fellowships

rel before the October dead-

ates Moussalli, Yielding, Crenshaw, and McCoy.
