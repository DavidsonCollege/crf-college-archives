Davidson to Meet Gen-
erals on Virginia Soil

Washington and Lee Squad Ready for
Next Saturday’s Battle

The Generals had their first scrim-
make last Saturday in preparation
for their opening game against the
Wildcats this week. Very few men
are back, and.some rare judgment is
having to be exercised by Coach
Raftery to fill gaps in last year’s
star eleven. With the Princeton
game, the pride of the W. & L.
schedule this year, only three weeks
off, the men are being run through
hard work outs daily.

In the line of last year’s team only
three men returned. Captain Moore,
Sanford and Mattox. The loss of
Bethel, towering guard. and main-
stay in the line, will effect the de-
fense materially. The backfield,
however,. is unusually — strong.
Raines. Silverstein, Cobb, MacDon-
ald, and Coghill all) returned and
this end of the work is not giving
the coaches much trouble. The chief
attention is being paid to the line,
where weak spots seem to be hard
to fll, The work of Barrow, tower-
ing 200 pounder, at sub-guard last
vear. has greatly pleased the coaches
this year. Others among last year’s
squad who are candidates this year
are Patterson, W., Patterson, J..
Henderson, Bemis, Riggs, Frew.
Thomas, Robinson and Marshall.

Of the new men, those who arc
showing up well are Herndon; Vo-
gel. of Roanoke High: Terry, from
Swathmore Prep.; Leake, of Mem-
phis University School, and Tucker,
of Charleston, W. Va., all-state half-
back in prep school circles.

The game will no doubt be full of
fight as the Wildcats are out to blot
out the 7 to 0 defeat administered to
them last year by the Generals. The
game is an annual affair and is al-
ways looked forward to with much
enthusiasm by both colleges, as each
is a representative of clean sport in
their respective states.

Prof. J. M. Wilson Brings
Message to Students

Hangchow Christian College and Its
Needs was Subject of Lecture

At the “Y" service last Sunday
evening Mr. J. M. Wilse delivered
an interesting message to the Da-
vidson student body, concerning the
work of Christian education in
China.

In the short space of one address
Mr. Wilson necessarily narrowed
down so broad a subject, and spoke
more specifically of the work at
Hangchow Christian College, of
Nangchow, China. He spoke briefly
of the history of the college, show-
ing its growth, and telling of some
of the great things which had heen
accomplished through its graduates.
Then turning to the present, he
showed the work of the college now,
and many of the bright aspects
which encourage the work from
every side. Mr. Wilson spoke, ton,
of the needs, both of this college.
and for other colleges in China; and
urged that the students, as Amer-
ican men, would see that their part
of this need was met.

“But some,” said Mr. Wilson,
“ask, ‘Why educate the Chinese; is
it not the mission of the Church to
evangelize, rather than educate, the
world ??* It is hard,” he replied, {to
show how difficult it is to explain
the Gospel to the Chinese. Before
they can accept it, they must under-
stand it: and to understand it they
must be taught. Furthermore, the
missionaries can never hope to
evangelize China, unless they make
them a_ self-supporting, native
Church: and for such a church there
must be educated leaders. It is the
purpose of Hangchow Christian
College to meet these needs. Of the
170 odd graduates of the college, en-
tering into almost every walk of
life, there have been only four which
were not Christians. In the vicinity

And thus it went throughout the

on the former's own grounds.

The Davidson team completely

stellar work of Faucette and Gur-

‘Davidson’s First Chautau-
qua a Great Success

Lecturers and Musicians Entertain
Large Audiences of Citi-
zens and Students

“-lave vou bought a season ticket
for the Chautauqua?” was the ques-
tim asked everyone last Tuesday.
This was the first Chautanqua tent
in Davidson's history that has ever
raised its wide spreading — shelter
over the tennis courts at the corner
of Main street and Concord avenue.
Owing to the untiring efforts of Dr.
Arbuckle and other leading citizens
of the community, one of the best
Chantauquas in the country was
contracted for, The Radclitfe Chau-
tanqua has an unusual varicty of
gifted speakers, entertainers, and
musicians an its program, and the
community and students enjoyed
the three days they were here very:
much,

The first entertainment was given
last. Tuesday afternoon at 3:15 p.m.
Dr. Frederick D. Losey. a former
university professor of English, and
one of the most noted lecturers in
the country, spoke on the stibject,
“Renelits Forget.” The lecture was
a plea for better use af the English
language in our every-day — life.
Many are forgetting the benefits we
have received from our forefathers
im their giving to us of ihe most ex-
pressive language in’ existence—to
those who care to grasp its untold
wealth of words and literature,

Dr. Losey was followed by the
Neopolitan Quartette, which pave a
musical program of fine variety,
ranging from Lucia Sextette to the
modern Dardanella.

At the evening performance. Dr.
Losey spoke on “The Gavernment
of the United States.” Much iime
was spent in bringing forth striking
parallels between our industrial and
educational system and — pre-war
Germany. Dr. Losey was a disciple.
of American initiative, against effi-
ciency, and pleaded for a return to
the humanities from the thought of
merely making a living.

The four versatile Jtalians in the
Neapolitan Quartette again rendered
the musical program. Senor Toney
proved quite amusing to all of the
children with his slight of hand
tricks, The major part of the pro-
grant was semi-classical and was
enjoved by all.

Chautauqua Thursday.
