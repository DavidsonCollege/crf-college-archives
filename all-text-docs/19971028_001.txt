Forum addresses

sorority concerns

By SARAH OGDEN
News Editor

Students and members of the fac-
ulty and administration discussed the
issue of sororities at a forum Wednes-
day night in the Home Room.

The discussion consisted of a panel
of seven people, including members of
Rusk and Connor and representatives
of the independents, as well as English
professor Elizabeth Mills and Patterson
Court Advisor Jim Barber. Patricia
Evans acted as mediator. ‘

Among those in attendance were
President Bobby Vagt and Assistant
Dean of Students and Director of Mi-
nority Student Affairs Ernest Jeffries.

The opening statements of posi-
tion each member of the panel was
asked to make revealed the mixed feel-
ings that seemingly represent the stu-
dent body's opinions, with four panel-
ists supporting the installation of so-
rorities and three opposing it.

In her introduction, Mills said that
Davidson is already too competitive,
and that there was no need to worsen
that atmosphete by adding another ex-
clusive organization. Mills also ques-
tioned whether enough students wanted
sororities for the endeavor to be woriti-
while, saying she’d heard mostly nega-
tive reactions to the idea. ‘

Bonner Mead, a member of Rusk
and a chief_proponent of sororities at
Davidson, said that she believed the
exclusivity typical of sororities can be
overcome. LaCrystal Jackson, an inde-
pendent, agreed, saying, “We can shape
our own sorority.”

However, Ellen Runnels, a mem-
ber of Connor who opposes sororities’
coming to Davidson, said that she had
no faith in Davidson’s ability to over-
come the exclusivity of sororities. Run-
nels said that she had witnessed enough
“cattiness” in eating houses to believe
that the addition of social groups from
which women could be excluded could

be disastrous.

Cristina Rodriguez, a Rusk mem-
ber and staunch supporter of sororities,
felt that the women of Davidson should
be given more credit, and that most
were above the pettiness feared in so-
rorities, but Runnels disagreed. —

Both Barber and Rodriguez em-
phasized the leadership opportunities
sororities offer to women.

Barber also pointed out that soror-
ity rush would be held:after the tradi-
tional self-selection process, and that it
would not be a typical rush situation,
but would be more similar to the bid
system campus fraternities currently
employ. “It would have to be acompro-
mise between self-selection and rush,”
Barber said.

Ann Culp, an independent, was
concerned that sororities would kill self-
selection. She said that mutual selec-
tion, which allows almost everyone who
wants to join a Greek organization to be
accepted into one, is different from the
self-selection system that eating houses
use, and that the two systems could not
coexist.

Mead countered Culp’s statement
by saying that women need to recog-
nize “how wonderful eating houses are,”
and that by strengthening the eating
house-member. relationship, sororities
and eating houses could, indeed, coex-
ist. Mead also said that if sororities did
eventually replace eating houses, it
would be because students wanted it to
happen. “It depends,” Mead said,.“‘on
how much women value the eating
houses.”

As for the “climate” on Patterson
Court, Runnels said that she’d heard
little support for sororities.

And even if sororities were to be
established, Rodriguez said, “I don’t
think they’re going to be a big part of
Patterson Court.”

Barber said that the sororities

Some department heads want to wait on minors

By Mary-E tise BRUMFIELD
Staff Writer

Minors at Davidson are a rela-
tively new concept, and only a few
departments have decided to give
Davidson students the option of choos-
ing a minor in their subject.

The departments that have yet to
establish a minor have different reasons
for holding back on their decisions.

“The long and the short of it is that
we are understaffed,” said Cynthia
Lewis, the new Chair of the English
department. “We can hardly handle the
number of majors that we have, and we
also teach an awful lot of service courses,
including English 101, and then several
literature courses for the core literature
requirement.

“Until we can add to our staff and
be able to deal with all of those demands
alittle more efficiently and reasonably,
we are not interested in adding a minor.

“We have discussed a minor in
writing, and I think that’s something we
may pursue at some point. We are
certainly not closed to the possibility,
but we are right now not considering it
because of problems with staffing.”

Art professor C. Shaw Smith said
that the main reason the art department
has not yet opened its doors to a minor
is that there are So many art majors and
anticipated majors, that there is no room,
place, time, or facilities for minors.

Shaw cited a secondary reason as
being that the use of comprehensive-
exams in both studio art and art history
does not fitthe limited number of classes

that would make up a minor.

However, Shaw does encourage
students to take as many art courses as
possible.

Psychology department head Ed
Palmer added: “We have so many ma-
jors, and are short-staffed in order to
meet all of the needs of the majors, that
we just don’t have the opportunity, the
time, or the capability to support a mi-
nor.”

“At this point,” said Benjamin
Klein of the math department, “the
mathematics department offers no mi-
nor. ;

“We anticipate offering a concen-
tration in computer science; however,
that concentration would be very close
to what a minor would be, (and) would
parallel a concentration in applied math-

ematics, a concentration which is also
the primary responsibility of the de-
partment of mathematics.

“We have held off on a mathemat-
ics minor until we saw how the com-
puter science proposal fares.

“It isn’t clear what we'll do if the
computer science concentration is in-
stalled, but we would certainly think
very hard about offering a minor at that
point.”

“Basically, the department of Clas-
sics is sucha diverse study of Greek and
Roman said Michael
Toumazou, chair of the Classics depart-
ment. “Itincorporates art, archaeology,
history, literature, Of course, and lan-
guages, and a minor, which would only
be five courses, would-be kind of mean-
ingless by itself.

As for equality, y’all are going the wrong way on this one. We should get rid of fraternities, not add sororities.
SENIOR MATTHEW HosBIE AT THE SORORITY FORUM WEDNESDAY NIGHT

“We would like very much to have
a minor if there’s a way we can come up
with some solution, and we’ re still actu-
ally working on it. We may decide to
have a minor in a language, but right
now, as it is, we haven't decided yet.”

And Earl Edmondson of the his-
tory department said that it is too hard to
define a history minor, and too difficult
to administer one.
