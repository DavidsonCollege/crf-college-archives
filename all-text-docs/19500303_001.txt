KRAMER AND GONZALES BRING
TENNIS RIVALRY TO CAMPUS

The much-publicized appearance of Jack Kramer and Pan
cho Gonzales on the Davidson campus will mark the first ex-
hibition match of top flight tennis professionals ever to be held
here and it is the first in nearly fifteen years for the Charlotte

section of North Carolina. Before the construction of the Johns-

ton Gymnasium such matches were
impossible, but if the response is
good this year it is hoped that pro-
fessional tennis champions may per-
form at Davidson each spring.
Kramer, who is former world
champion, ; lays a careful, mechani-
cal, well worked out game, and’ in

“the early part of the exhibition tour

gained a large lead over Gonzales,
Pancho, however, has improved
rapidly and seems to have gotten on
to Kramer’s game. For the past
twenty matches Gonzales has been
winning slightly more than his
share. By the time they reach here
they should be playing on even
terms. Gonzales has been American
Amateur champion for the last two
years and turned professional only
last October. He has a great deal
6f natural ability and a tremendous
service. His play is very colorful.
Whatever their record is when they
arrive at Davidson the spectators
can ‘be assured of an excellent
match,

The date of the exhibition is Wed.
nesday, March 15, Beginning at 8:15
there will be a match between for-
mer National Champion Frank
Parker, who has been rated among
the first ten in the nation every
year for the past fifteen years, and
South American Champion Pancho
Segurd. Segurd is especially noted
for his two handed forehand shot.
Following will be the feature match
between Gonzales and Kramer. A
doubles match will conelude the pro-
gram. Each match will consist of
the usual three sets. The pairing for
the doubles match has not been an-
nounced, but it may include former
Amateur World Champion and Pro-
fessional Champion Buddy Riggs,
who is the promoter of the tour.

All seats for the match are re.
served and are sold for $1.50 to
students and $2,50 to the general
public. There is no set deadline for
purchasing tickets, but the best
seats are going fast. Tickets may be
purchased in the ticket office of the

Dr. Walter Lingle
Speaks In Chapel

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, President
Emeritus of Davidson College,
spoke to the student body at chapel
Tuesday morning.

Dr. Lingle attended Davidson
College where he received his B.A,
M..A., and D.D. deyrees attending
Union Theological Seminary where
he later tanghr Greek and Hebrew,
He has held pastorates in Georgia
and South Carolina and was presi-
dent of General Assembly Training
School at Richmond: Dr. — Lingic
was President of Davidson College
from 1929 to 1941, preceeding Dr.
Cunningham. He wrote Memoirs of
Davidson and contributes regularly
to the “Christian Observer.”

Dr. Lingle talked on the world of

tomorrow and the characteristics |

which will ensure success. “No mat-
ter how different tomorrow’s world
will be,” Dr. Lingle said, “four qual-
ities will always be at a premium.
They are character and personality,
Courtesy, work, and purpose,”
“These four virtues,” he said, “were
ata premium all during my life and
even though we now have automo-
biles, television, airplanes and other
things beyond man’s imagination 5v
years ago, these same qualities are
still at a premium.”

The lesson of Christ on the pri-
macy of character, courtesy, work,
and purpose, was well learned by
Dr. Lingle and is still being exen-
plified in his life today. He takes
literally the statement, “Practice
what you preach.”

Omicron Delta Kappa

Holds First Meeting

Davidson's Delta circle of Omi.
cron Delta Kappa, national honor-
ary fraternity, met Feb. 22 for the

fiest time this semester. The mect-

ing was called .to order by Bill
Bird, president of the circle, and
Dr, Schenk, the secretary, read the

minutes of the last meeting.

The highlight of this recent meet-
ing was a discussion of the conduct
of Davidson students during chapel

exercises. It was the opinion of sev-,

eral members of the ODK circle
that Davidson's morning chapel
programs are not serving their pur-
pose. An evidence of this, according

to these campus feaders, is seen in,

students’ behavior during some of
our devotional periods. The ODK
members decided upon certain
measures that might be adopted so
as to remedy this seeming disinter-
est in our morning assembly per-
iods. The following actions were

suggested. (1) the abolishment of,

Student Day chapel programs, (2)
the enforcement of compulsory
chapel attendance for only morn-
ings éach week. Several members
of the circle later presented these
proposals to Dean Bailey and Dr.
Cunningham, who suggested that a
student committee be organized to
plan Davidson's chapel programs
for the benefit and interest of the
student body of the college. As 3
result of this conference with the
dean and the president, Liston
Mills, John Lyles, and Doug Rice.
all members of ODK, are soon to
appear before Davidson College's

as to reach an agreement as to how
the college’s morning devotionals
‘may be improved. The Religious
Exercises Committee has as its

Rev. Carl R. Pritchett,

cussion spring from the question of
the usage of Davidson's old gymmna-
sium, but no conclusion was reach-
ed. The circle’s members decided

If well received by the student

thusiastic support of the dance is

Tests Scheduled For
Students Doubtful

Of Future Careers

Davidson College. is making avail-
able to as many students as pos-
sible this year batteries of vocation-
al aptitude tests which seek to give
participants material which they can
use as a guide in choosing their
vocations.

As explained by Professor Os:
walt in chapel last Thursday, al-
most a third of the students here,
have been unable to decide on any
field of business toward which they
can work. An amazing point is that
the 232 students undecided ‘Jast fall
were almost equally divided among
the four classes. In ‘other words,
there is an indication that many
boys not sure at their entrance in-
to college as to their desires re-
main so until their senior year. In
addition, a very large number of
students entertain serious doubts as
to the wisdom of their choices.
When we realize that the purpose
of a school like Davidson is to pre.
pare men in the most practical way
for taking their correct places in
society, we can see the dangerous
wasted time being consumed by
boys who go through college with
no good criterion by which to
choose their courses — time which
can never be replaced,

In plain facts, 227 men have stat-
ed their intention to enter the field
of business; 139, medicine; 94, min-
istry; 52, law; 41, teaching; and
about 60, other professions. Of .
these, many wete very doubtful.
Listed as undecided were 77 Fresh-
men, 52 Sophomores, 49 Juniors,
and 54 Seniors, Probably almost fif-
ty per cent of the student body
is unsure.

As a held to those undecided and
doubtful students, these tests have
been arranged. Because the num-
ber of tests available is this year
limited, and because their need ia
obviously greatest, seniors will be
given first choice. Any remaining
tests will be distributed among
those of the other classes who wish
and need them. Professor Oswalt
hopes to give 50 or 75 batteries this
year, and possibly as many as 150
next year to catch ap the slack, and
thereafter to keep up with the de-
