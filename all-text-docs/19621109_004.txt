Davidson College has various means of breaking out of its perennial isolation
booth and disseminating its character throughout the Iand—means such as debate
teams. THE DAVIDSONIAN. Sterling Martin’s straw leading the pack, and the weekly

For it is going on the radio,
and the full power of Charlotte’s
1110 station, WBT, will be tell-
ing of us to everyone from Fidel
Castro to the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.

Bob Ivey, the writer, organiz-
er, and announcer for this week-
ly. 15 minute expose. avows the
show's purpose to be: “To make
it possible for listeners to be
able to maintain contaet with
higher education.”

if the American public can
tear itself away from the high-
er education of TV from 9:45
to 10:00 every Monday night,
they will hear interviews, pan-
el discussions, musicals, and
descriptions of and samplings
from nearly all areas of cam-
pus activity.

This condensed Davidson ver-

sion of Monitor will begin this

Monday night, Nov.; 12, with a

general introduction and a brief

history of the college.

which a student ean get exper-
iance in OXpressing himself. The
primary benefit of drama is a
chance at vocal expression. But
the student can also realize
benefits in his education in the
field of literature. benefits in
experiencing emotions and feel-
ings, and benefits in learning to
understand the problems of
others.”

President Martin ssid that
he had gone over with Goody-
koontz the specific list of
problems and that the admin-
istration would work as rapid-
ly as possible to clear them
up. He said that the college
would make an effort immed-
iately to secure an expert to
train interested students in
the operation of the lights for
the stage.

He also said that the college
would start at once ‘to work out
adequate storage space for
props to relieve the space prob-
lem in the Fine Arts Building.

Both Martin and Goodykoontz
attributed the problem to the
breakdown of communication
and understanding at several
key points. Both feel that now
that the problems have been
brought out and discussed the
dramatic operations will go
much more smoothly.

Don Stowell, when reached
by THE DAVIDSONIAN, seid
that the outcome of the meet-
ing would have no effect on
his decision to resign. He did
state that Galileo would be
staged as scheduled.

He said his main difficulty
was in the amount of work that
he had been doing wrth the
Vagabonds. He was in the in-
firmary for three days at the
end of last week suffering from
nervous exhaustion.

Stowell said that “misunder-
standings on several points with
several people” had created
more work than was necessary
on the part of himself and
Goodykoontz. He said, “I. don’t
have any gripes with anybody;
I just want out. This is what it
boils down to. My feelings are-
n't hurt. I’ve had a lot of co-
operation from a lot of people
around here.”

He went on to say that the
Vagabonds “have done some
damn good shows, thanks main-
ly to the students.”

President Martin said that he
hoped that Stowell would re-
verse his decision about leaving
Davidson. He said that if Stowell
does leave, the college would
attempt at once to find a com-
petent man to assist Goody-
koontz with the dramatics pro-
gram.

However, Ivey is not including
certain, major events from the
purchase of the land from Me-
thogists with $24.00 worth of
trinkets to the paper plane bar-
rage on Pete Ney during this
year’s Catawba game. Comments
from Presiderit D..Grier Martin
and Danny Carrell. .will add
notes of vivaciousness to this
premiere show.

Other shows will feature a
visit from the Board of Visit-
ors, drinking songs by the
Male Chorus, and a taped in-
terview with that droll new
entertainer, Nels F. S. Ferre.
The maintenance men were
rumored to have volunteered
to do a program of spirituals,
Ajex Cleanser songs, and
reminiscences of shower-room
experiences, but Ivey has
wisely refused.

This program will be a ser-
ious attempt by Ivey and the

Freshman Council
Decides On Stokes

_ The Freshman Council elect-
‘ed Jim Stokes, president; John-
_ ay Webb, secretary-treasurer;
‘and Bob Groat, projects chair-
Iman at its regular meeting last
week.

President Stokes comes from
‘Winter Park, Fla., where he was
graduated as salutatorian of his
senior class. He is a pledge of
_Alpha Tau Omega social frater-
nity and is a member of the
| Frosh swimming team. He hopes
‘to major in chemistry.

Webb, from Chattanooga,
Tenn., attended the Baylor
School for Boys in Chattanooga
before coming to Davidson. At
Baylor he received the NDCC
Superior Cadet award. Webb is
| an Independent, he works in the
;Union and is interested in
i wrestling.

Groat, the projects chairman,
is from Greensboro and finished
Greensboro High as salutatorian
of his class. He is an Independ-

_ent and, although still undecid-
‘ed. is thinking about majoring
jin chemistry.

swer, found out that Barth did
indeed not believe, from another
graduate student on a jaunt
through the Near East.

After this, the two hour
“heated” argument with Rein-
hold Niebuhr in which Ferre
caused him to equivocate his
position was just frosting to
the cake.

When it grew too laté to poise
like doubt on the edge of a
chair dnd crumble cookies and
drink coffee, Ferre rose _ to
leave. He moved through the
seige of questions like a reluc-
tant earthworm through Jell-o
and only at last reached the
door trailing an eager pegipate-
tice following.

Monday morning and night
and Tuesday morning followed;
by the last lecture Ferre had
seen enough to state that he
knew his audience was there by
force. still he would not amuse
them but give them the best he
had to offer. The cosmic
had lost its appeal.

But what of Nels Ferre, the
man talked of bibliographies
like the old friends they were?
He spoke for the literacy of the
Resurrection, and the tradition-
al faith based on- this fact of
history. He was glad to have
fundamentalists argue with him;
“It shows there is still someone
to the right.” The rest was ela-

boration, interesting, often ar-;

resting, often funny.

For a while Ferre had reveled
in the Southern traditionalism.
Students now hold their bull-
sessions without the man with
the famous friends and the fun-
ny laugh in a residual Swedish
accent. Life, and its questions,
slogs ahead.
