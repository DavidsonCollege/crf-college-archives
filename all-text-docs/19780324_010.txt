Vocal women prove three years is not enough

Everyone at Davidson has probably
heard of the Davidson College Male
Chorus; the group can even boast
national exposure. But right here on
campus many people still return blank
stares to anyone mentioning the David-
son College Women’s Chorus.

Yes, the College does have a Women’s
Chorus, however obscure it may seem to
some. The Chorus originated three years
ago, only one full year after women had
first come to Davidson.

The push for a Chorus came from some
women students who, with the coopera-
tion of the Music Department, sought
out other women to attempt what began
as an extremely experimental project.

Professor of music Donald Plott said
that a big question was ‘‘whether at that

These ideals of chivalry and gentle
manly conduct were described by Allen
Blalock,’78, who -serves as Second

Supervisor in the society. He takes
charge of members’ conduct at their
regularly scheduled meetings, making
certain that the strictest parliamentary
procedure is maintained.

As in days gone by, the Society's
members are: still required to wear coats
and ties to all its functions, ‘‘Debate is
encouraged among the members so that
they may continue their education beynd

the classroom, and on their own
initiative,”” observed Will Miller, ’78,
who is president.

Each senior in the Society, reported
Blalock, must present a diplomate
address on a subject of his own choosing.
Most are given in the spring and vary in
length.

The members are not the only speak-
ers. Recently, guest speakers have

point there were enough women on
campus.”

The group of girls who responded,
however small, was determined and
enthusiastic. The members were willing
to start from scratch, and they did.

The Women’s Chorus hegan as all
choruses at Davidson have begun, with a
student director. Said Plott, ‘‘the Male
Chorus was started by a student director
eighty years ago.”

Pat Morris, a music student, accepted
the responsibility of creating a chorus
from the collection of female students
who wanted to sing. ‘“‘She took this as
301 and 401 projects for her major,”’
Plott explained.

Interest was high at first, and the
women accomplished much. They were
able to participate in the Harvest Moon
Concert, and they sang by invitation in
several churches.

included Chalmers Davidson, an author-
ity on the Society’s history; the head of
the nationally acclaimed College Bowl
team of 1967, Robert Bryan; Dr. Lance
“tell spoke on libertarianism; Dr. Mal-
colm Partin presented his famous lecture

on Catherine the Great. Last spring,
Dean Pasco Bowman of the Wake Forest
school of Law presented a talk on
reverse discrimination, as seen in the

Supreme Court Bakke case.

Miller reports that the Society meets
every other Sunday evening at 8:00, and
each session lasts an hour. A student can
become a member by showing interest at
meetings, being nominated by a mem-
ber, reviewed by the membership com-
mittee, and a vote by the entire Society.

The Philanthropic Society is affiliated
with the North Carolina Conservative
Society and the Inter-Collegiate Studies
Institute.

Toward the end of the year, though,
interest among the members seemed to
wane. ‘‘It was sort of going into neutral
in the last part of spring term,”’ admits
Plott.

The interest did not die, however, and
the program resumed the next fall*for its
second year. Prospects looked hopeful
for the chorus. ‘‘We decided,’’ ‘Plott said,
“that it was going to grow enough.”

And grow it did. It outgrew its
student director that year, with, of
course, more than a slight debt to her
graduation.

Because of the combination of Pat
Morris’ graduation, the chorus’ energe-
tic efforts, and the administration’s
increasing respect for the group’s work,
the Davidson College Women’s Chorus
acquired a professional director.

The hiring of Ms. Linda Warren as
Women’s Chorus director represented

-

recognition of the chorus by the admini-
stration and a great step forward for the
group.

Funding is nevertheless still very
vague. Explained Plott, ‘‘It still hasn't
come in the grand sense.”’

The Chorus’ expenses have been
absorbed by the Music Department,
slighting to some extent the other music
organizations. ‘‘The Male Chorus, for
example, is cutting down on the number
of spring trips we make,’’ said Plott
without resentment. ‘‘We just don’t
have the money.”

Although the Women’s Chorus has
made tremendous progress, it is still
striving for more and better advances.
General recognition as a separate and
worthwhile group is one goal which,
while it is closer than ever before, is not
as far-reaching as the group would like.

Show - and - Tell

Wednesday morning, the senior citi-

zens gathered in the Depot, no longer the
railroad station, to display and compare
their various crafts and hobbies.
The displays ranged from coin and
stamp collections to quilt-making. This

“Show and Tell” is only one of many

programs sponsored by Davidson’s Cen-
ter for Senior Citizens.

The head of the center, Brigid
O'Conner, encourages all Davidson Col-
lege students to pitch in and give a hand
with upcoming projects. Contact her at
