Sports”

THERE’S no other sport on the calendar to
compare with smoking a jimmy-pipe packed
with P. A. Indoors and out. Any season. You
win even when you draw, if you get what we
mean. And how you will draw, once you know
the wonderful taste of Prince Albert!

Cool as an over-cut notice from the dean.
Sweet as the thoughts of a holiday. Fragrant as
woodland flowers after a spring shower. P. A.

“never bites your tongue or parches your throat.
The Prince Albert process ee that the day
P. A. matriculated.

Come out for this major sport. Get yourself
a tidy red tin at that nearby smoke-shop where
they hand out P. A. sunshine. You and Prince
Albert are going to be great buddies right from

the start. Because there just never was another
;) Pes — tobacco like Prince Albert!

PRINGE ALBERT

—no other tobacco is like it!

P.A. is sold everywhere in
tidy red tins, fiaeleyd and de
pound tin midors, and
pound .crystal-glass humidors
with sponge-moistener top.
And always with every bit
° bite and parch removed by
e Prince Albert process,

Cue to Jazz Orchestra

The following composition was written
by a fifth grade pupil. Would you be-
lieve such intelligence could exist outside
of college? “The cow is a four-legged
quadruped that walks on four feet. It
has a contented disposition, and although
she’s a big pet she is never very wild.
The cow is very useful both when dead
and when alive. We get milk,
‘cheese and ice cream from live cows. AlI-
so dairy products. When she’s dead they
sell her hide for its value as a food, called
steak, and her flesh is widely known. as
the chief ingredient of chicken salad.”

The Jazz Ordeeac ui with the addition of |
several new members, has been holding daily
practices for the last week, and all indica-
tions point to a successful year.

“Tootie”’ Crayton, who. was well known |
on the campus last year as a saxaphonist of |
exceptional merit, and as director’of the or-
chestra,, will be greatly missed this year.
The orchestra has been fortunate, however,
in securing the services of several new men
| of talent. Gordon McSwain is playing trom-
|bone; Brown McQueen, alto saxaphone; |
Knox Poole, helicon; Paul Frye, piano; and |

saxaphone; Bob McConnell, drums.

As usual the Jazz Orchestra will function
as a part of the Davidson College Glee Club |
and appear on whatever programs that or-

Drummer McConnell will now favor us

with the latest jazz hit, “Great Britain is |
master of the waves, but France con-
trols the permanent.”
