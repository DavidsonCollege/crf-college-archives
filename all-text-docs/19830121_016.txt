Saturday, 22 January

[The editors would like to apologize for the disappear-
ance of Saturday, 15 January from last week’ s C ampus
Calendar. Everyone has their least favorite days of the
week, the editors are no exception. It was just a poor
choice to eliminate an entire day of the week—one sev-
enth of the calendar’ s events—just because Saturdays
are a drag. As it has turned out, some people really like
Saturday, so here it is in all its glory: Saturday, 22 Jan-
uary.

Stuart, Stewart, Stu, Stu-babes, and Stu-my-man.
