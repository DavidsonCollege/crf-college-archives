other considerations. Dr. Engell

sumption among Davidson stu-
dents was also addressed in. the
survey. When polled whether or
not davidson should more strictly
enforce state drinking laws, and
overwhelming majority of 78%
disagreed. 74% also feel that the
new drinking laws haven’t re-
duced alcohol consumption on

One of the most publicized de-
cisions of the year has been the
proposed swithch to the semester
system. On this issue, 39% feel
we should change, 38% feel we

should remain .on trimesters and
22% are undicided. 47% of stu-
dents feel that daily classes en-

17% are undecided. —

——Semesters continued ——

“The more students express prob-
lems, the smoother the transition
will be,” he said. Based on polls
taken by professors and the Politi-
cal Science 129 (Public Opinion)
class, student opinion on the
semester issue is as everily divided
as that of the faculty. Some see the
change as providing a less intense
studying environment.
Davidson made a wise choice. It
will give students more time to re-
ally get into a class and relax,”
said freshman Sheldon Garmon.
“The semester system will
offer a welcome change of pace
my senior year,” said sophomore

“J. think tant

Others are very opposed to the
move. “One of the reasons I came
here was the trimester system. I’d
rather have just three classe and
get them over with sooner,” said
freshman Amelia Fox. _

“TI feel that the semester sys-
tem puts too much of a premium
on choosing a major early in one’s
college career. In this sense it re-
stricts a person’s choices when the
ability to choose is most impor-
,” said junior Jeff Gregory.
The first semester under the
new system in 1988 will last from
August 24 through December 20,
with a break between November,
19 and 27. The second semester,
in 1989, will last from January 11
through May 15, with a break be-
tween March 15 and 21.

Religious Life/Church Re-
lations: |
The resolution which was
adopted by the Board at your Feb-
Tuary Meeting has now been con-
veyed to the Synod of North
Carolina and to other interested
parties in the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.). It appears that the
Board’s action comes at a very
timely juncture in the Church’s
life, since it seems probable that
the proposals for revisions of
boundaries for Presbyteries and
Synods will go forward in the
course of the next few months.
Pending positive response from
the current Presbyteries, the
Synod of North Carolina and the’

Synod of the Piedmont will take

action on proposed revision of
Presbytery boundaries at the joint
meeting to be held on the David-
son campus May 28-30. Sub-
sequently, the General Assembly
will probably act upon the pro-
posed new Synod boundaries at its
meeting in Biloxi, Mississippi in
mid-June. Thus, it will probably
be necessary for Davidson to deal
with the reallocation of Presbytery
assignments at some point in the
near future. We will plan to pro-
vide you with an update on this
situation after the meeting of the
General Assembly in June.
As we look toward the Ses-
— Commencement

ceremony and the Summer, there
are one or two projects which I
hope to initiate as the pace slows
down a bit. The first has to do with
the necessary review of the Strate-
gic Planning document in prepara-
tion for the October Meeting of
the Board. It is my hope to be able
to propose to Chairman John Belk
and the members of the Strategic
Planning Committee whatever re-
visions seem appropriate by the
end of the Summer, so that the
Committee ‘can act upon these as
the new school year begins. I also
plan to’establish an ad: hoc group
to survey Davidson’s current in-
volvement in service activities of
all kinds, with an eye toward mak-
ing some recommendations which
would fulfill that particular aspect
of our strategic plan more
adequately than we have been able
to do to date.

In addition to those hopes for
the Summer, I am also hoping for
“a few good men” — and
women! — who want to. go.on
our pilgrimage through the lands
of our Presbyterian heritage.
Missy and I are looking forward to
that special opportunity , and hope
that we will be joined in the jour-
ney by a number of on David-
son friends.

I look forward to seeing each
of you on the campus on April 30
and May 1, and thank you for all :
that you continue to do for David-
son College.

Faculty and Curriculum:

After eight months of inten-

- give discussion and debate under .

le la

the leadership of Dean Robert C.
Williams, the Educational Policy
Committee is prepared to present
the faculty with a proposal for cur-
riculum revision and a change of
the calendar to an early semester
pattern which is most frequently

‘used in higher éducation today. If

the faculty sees fit to approve this
plan, it will be conveyed to you
for your review at the. October
Meeting of the Board and would
then go into effect in the 1988-89
school year. As was previously re-
ported, a major aspect of the cur-

‘ riculum enhancement will be the

effort to strengthen the junior and
senior year in the humanities, in-
cluding greater opportunities for
independent study, faculty-stu-
dent joint research projects and
new interdisciplinary courses —
all to be undertaken under the
generosity of the Pew Foundation,
which has made us a grant of
$499,000 for this project.

I am delighted to inform you
that Professor Thomas Kazee of
our Department of Political Sci-
ence has been granted a Congres-
sional Fellowship from the Amer-
ican Political Science Association

_ for sabbatical study next year.

You will also be interested to
know that Grant D. Jones, Profes-
sor of Anthropology, has accepted
Bob Williams invitation to serve
as the Director of our Grants and
Contracts Office, which was set
up this year under the leadership
of Professor John Kelton with
funds from the Duke Endowment.

“ addition to his other qualifica-

ee re ee

tions, Professor Jones brings a
certain symmetry of nomenclature
to the job. We are still trying to de-
cide what sign to put on his door:
“Grant’s Office?’ “Grants by
Grant?” “Grant’s Grants?” or
perhaps “Grants?’’) ‘<

This term is the final one be-
fore retirement for Jean Cornell,
Associate Professor of Speech,
who has been a member of the
Davidson faculty since 1971. We
owe Jean a sincere expression of
thanks for her good service to the
College.

You will be hearin a further
report from. the Committee on
Academic and Educational Policy
concerning recommendations on
tenure and promotion for this
year. Bob Williams and I will, of
course, be available for further
comment on those matters as is
appropriate.

Campus Planning and Physical
Plant:

The work immediately before
us in the area of physical facilities
is both diverse and challenging. In
the course of the Summer months,
we will be undertaking several
projects designed to provide space
desperately needed for the ongo-
ing activities of the College next
year. The. continuing process of
“liberating” . Chambers for
academic use will lead us in the
course of this Summer to remove
additional administrative offices
to Jackson Court and perhaps
other places on campus. Grover
‘Meetze has a personal commit-
ment outstanding to Mr. Ray Oc-.

land to see to it that the Oeland

Language Center is ensconced in
the south basement of Chambers
by next Fall, and we will also be
renovating the spaces'' upstairs
which have ‘been used for the
audio-visual and language lab ac-
tivities for faculty office and
classroom space. In addition, this
Summer will also bring with it
continuation of our work on en-
largement and pavement of park-
ing areas and renovation and pos-
sible air conditioning of dor-
mitories insofar as our budgeting
will permit. ‘

There are a number of other
major projects which will be pas-
sing through fairly critical stages
this Summer as well. We will be
consulting with several Trustee
committees prior to the plenary
session concerning the timetable
for ground breaking for the Baker
Sports Complex, and will also
plan to make reports through ap-
propriate committees to the Board
concerning plans for additional
student housing (to be available
for September of 1988) and for the
enhanced facilities for the arts.
We also hope to be in a position to
provide preliminary recommen- —
dations concerning the proper ap-
proach to evaluation of our long-
term plans for the development
and utilization of College prop-
erty. It seems clear that our cur-
rent holdings, together with what-
ever future acquisitions the Board
might undertake, promise to be
significant assets for the College's
future.
