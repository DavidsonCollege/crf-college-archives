THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 17,

DUKE GAME TO
FEATURE WEEK.-
END OF FESTIVITY

WILDCATS PREP
FOR WONDERFUL
DUKE ELEVEN

Coaches “Doc” Newton and Gene Mec-
Ever’ last engaged their Wildcat eleven
in a contest with the United States Mili-
tary Academy Cadets, which with the ex-
ception of Princeton, is probably the best

team in the East. Saturday afternoon
Coach Wallace Wade brings his Duke
Blue Devils outfit, certainly as good as
any in the Southland, to play the New-
ton-McEver machine on Richardson
Field. In many respects, however, it will
be a vastly different eleven taking the
gridiron against the Dukes from the one
that allowed the Army to so thoroughly
drub them.

It will have been two weeks
since the West Point affair when
the Cats lock horns with the
Devils, and during that fortnight
the Davidson mentors have taught
their charges a great deal in addi-
tion to the nice lesson they got in
tackling and blocking on the west
bank of the Hudson a few days
ago. True it is that Duke has a
world of power, that very clearly
manifested itself against the Yellow
Jackets from Georgia Tech, but it
takes a heap more than sheer
power to really lick the Presby-
terians when their cleets are dug
in the Richardson Field turf.

I can’t go so far as to ‘predict a victory
for the Wildcats on Saturday, but I will
promise that Coach Wade, along with
all Dukedom, will experience a hectic
afternoon in the Davidson Stadium. It
seems almost impossible to me that Duke
could be any better than Army was on
October 6th, but I am sure of the fact
that the Felines will do much better this
week-end than they did against the
Cadets, and it was perfectly obvious that
Gar Davidson spent a most miserable
first quarter, while his proteges were en-
gaging the Cats.

Saturday it will be Johnny Mac-
korell’s time to match wits with
the Blue Devil All-American pros-
pect, Corky Cornelius. The Wild-
cat Captain held his own very
nicely when being compared with
the famed Jack Buckler, so the
Duke ace shouldn’t give him much
worry. i
The Wademen this year are boasting

about their backfield more than the line,
and evidently Coach Voyles has a crack-
erjack quartet in Cornelius, Clarence
Parker, the man who punts and passes
in high figures, Jule “On” Ward, and
Jack “Scooter” Alexander, but I'll take
Coach McEver’s combination of Mac-
korell, Wingfield, Hutchens and Yar-
borough or Verble. Paul “Scatter-Brain”
Pittman can fill a berth in this group very
ably also, A light crew, yes, but they
can make plenty of noise. With Mac-
korell and Wingfield in the ball carrying
roles, and the others paving the way,
these ponies would fit into any lineup.

The average weights of the two
lines stack up about evenly, with
the Wildcat’s blimp-shaped guard
“Tubby” Hand in one of the posi-
tions. This is the only assignment,
however, where the David will

BOTH MAKE THREATS

Humphrey Plays = Outstanding
Game For Visiting Team

Davidson's “All Americans” battled the
Campbell College eleven to a scoreless
tie last Saturday, on Richardson Field.

The Wildcat B team made several
scoring threats, but lacked the neces-
sary offensive punch to put over a touch-
down. Both teams appeared ragged in
spots and neither could gain a distinct
advantage.

In the period the Campbell
gridmen took the ball to the Davidson
five-yard line after blocking one of
Johnston's kicks. Richardson came in
fast to throw the Buies Creek team for
a five-yard loss and on second down they
lost the ball on an incomplete pass over
the goal. Humphrey, Campbell quarter-
back, was the most consistent ground-
gainer for his team and exhibited plenty
of drive in his off-teckle smashes and
return of punts.

Johnny Pearce, Davidson back, put on
a neat exhibition of speed and. fancy
footwork. In the third quarter he took
the ball from a spread formation and
side-stepped--his- way 35 yards forthe
longest single gain of the day. It was
later in this period that Davidson's of-
fense began clicking and twice they
threatened the Campbell goal. Pearce in-
tercepted a pass on the Campbell 45-
yard line. The “All-Americans” then
opened: up a pass attack which carried
them to the 10-yard stripe. Here the
Wildcats received a 25-yard penalty for
clipping, thus halting their march. They
later drove down the field to the Camp-
bell 15-yard line but the defense. stiffened
and the “All-Americans” lost the ball on
downs.

Fourth Year Men Win
In Interclass Football

Intramural football now in full
swing at Davidson with four games al-
ready having been played. The Seniors
are leading the inter-class league at
present with two wins in as many starts,
having beaten the Frosh, 12-0, and «the
Sophomores, 12-6. The Juniors and
Sophomores are tied for second place,
each having registered a win and a loss.
The third year men have a 24-0 win
over the Frosh and a 12-24 licking at the
hands of the Sophs. ‘The Freshmen’s two
defeats give them an undisputed hold
on fourth place. The four classes play
six games apiece, each facing the other
three teams twice.

The interfraternity league will soon be
inaugurated to give added interest to the
intramural sports program. This group
uses thé match play system in which a
team is eliminated from further competi-
tion once it has suffered a defeat. In

WEATHER HALTS
FALL TOURNEY

Wet Courts Hamper Play In Sec-
ond Round, Players Advance

Several days of rainy weather and’ the
resulting wet courts delayed the annual
fall varsity and freshman tennis tourna-
ments for several days.

These tournaments are being run off
under the direction of Ed Garret, varsi-
ty tennis manager.

In the varsity competition all six of
the seeded players have advanced to the
second round except Hornbeck, seeded
fifth, who defaulted to Lindsay. Scores
of the matches of the other seeded men
are: Barnett (1) defeated Elder, 6-0, 6-2;
Lewis (2) defeated Crew, 6-1, 6-1, Elvery

Carlson (6) defeated Feutchenberger in
the only close match, 6-3, 2-6, 6-3.

Felix Predicts

According to Felix, this business of
picking the winning grid team each Sat-
urday isn’t as much of a cinch as it ap-
pears. Pa the large majority of
forecasts hav& panned out as scheduled,
some have been missed so far that some
persuasion was needed to keep Felix
from attempting a long period of hiber-
nation during the present season.

However, considering that many games
have turned out in the negative from
What many of us expected, due in most
cases to Lady Luck or Old Man Weath-
er, Felix has decided to come back this
time stronger than ever, and with the
right forecasts, as far as it is possible
for him to tell.

Here they are: DUKE vs Davidson,

NORTH CAROLINA vs Kentucky,
FLORIDA vs North Carolina State,
WAKE FOREST vs _ Presbyterian,

SOUTH CAROLINA vs Citadel, FUR-
MAN vs: Mercer, CATAWBA vs _ Guil-
ford, V. P. I. vs Maryland, V. M. T. vs
Richmond, PRINCETON vs W. & L.,
ALABAMA vs Tennessee, VANDER-
BILT vs Auburn, TULANE vs Georgia,

L. S. U. vs Arkansas, MISS. A. & M. vs

ginia.

Saturday was a lucky day for the Big
Five teams, when all three having games

South Carolina.

Probably the biggest upset of the day
came when Carolina defeated Georgia,
14-0, at Athens, Giving a surprising dis-
play of power and good defensive play-
ing, the ‘Heels humbled the Georgia Bull-

Shaeffer was the star for Carolina, mak-
ing a brace of touchdowns: once in the
second quarter when he nabbed a pass,
and-again in the fourth, running it over
the one yard line.

Most in the sports spotlight was the
Duke-Georgia Tech clash. A_ record
crowd thronged the Duke Stadium —to
see the “Blue Devils drub the Yellow

gation, led by Cornelius and Parker
swept the Georgians off their feet with
a spectacular passing attack. Coming as
sweet revenge for last year’s 6-0 defeat,
this game leaves Duke still undefeated

this season.

State made a lone touchdown in the
fourth period to eke out a 6-0 victory
over South Carolina. Although the lead
did not come until late in the day, the
Wolfpack outplayed and outfought the

Davidson Alumnus Plays

With St. Louis In Series

A Davidson Alumnus was a member of
the Saint Louis Cardinals who last week
won a thrilling seven-game world series
from the Detroit
League champions.

Tigers, American

This athlete was Pat Crawford, '29,
who went in twice as a pinch hitter, hit-
ting for Jess Haines in the third game
of the series which Paul “Daffy” Dean
won for the National League champions
4-0; end in the fifth he batted for “Diz-
zy" Dean after Dean had lost the game
to the Tigers 3-1. Crawford while at
Davidson was an All-State baseball and
basketball player and President of the
VM GcA;

This world series was one of the clos-
est and most colorful in years. The
score in games see-sawed back and forth,
but no team “ever had a lead of more
than one game over the other.

The highligh of the series was the
pitching for the Cards by the Dean broth-
ers, “Dizzy” and “Daffy”, who between
them won all four games for the Red
Birds. The climax of the series came in
the seventh game when “Dizzy” pitched
the Cards to a 11-0 shutout, the largest
score ever recorded in a world’series, the
former record of 7-0 was held by Christy
Matheson for many. years.

KITTENS MEET
PLEBES FRIDAY

Potential ’Cat Gridmen Play
V. P. I. Freshmen In
Second Game

Coach Laird’s proteges will meet the
V. P. I. Plebes Friday afternoon at
Richardson Field. The game, the Kit-
tens’ second of the season, is scheduled
to get under way at 3:30 p.m. The
Freshmen will be out to avenge a 13-0
defeat, suffered last year at the hands
of the Virginia ‘eleven,

Coach Laird sent his forces through a
two and a half hour workout Monday
afternoon and was not pleased with the
showing his boys made. He Wedld give
no information concerning the game this
week after the drill.

Before the Darlington game two weeks
ago, halfback Hogan was @lected captain
of the team with the alternate captain
honors going to quarterback Barrow.

The Kittens came out of the Darling-
ton game very lightly, with only one in-
jury. Harrison, left halfback, received
a leg injury but will be in shape for the
V. P. I. tilt this week.

Since the Darlington game, the Fresh-
men offensive ‘has developed a great deal
while three scrimmages against the var-
sity has kept the defense down a little.
Another scrimmage is scheduled for this
week, probably this afternoon.

The Kittens, although nothing is de-
finite,, will take the field Friday with
practically the same lineup that started
their first game. There is a possibility
of one or two changes.

In the line Hill will start in the place
of Freeman at left tackle while Alex
Brown may get the call at the center of
the line in place’of Overall.

The backfield composed of Barrow,
Harrison, Hogan, and Dennis is slated to
open the game. In case Harrison should
not be able to start, Lafferty will. get
the nomination.

In the Darlington game this backfield
averaged a gain of 4.5 yards per try
which was a little shy of the Darlington
eleven who came out of the affair with
a 4.7 yard gain.

Dennis led the locals with a 5.2 yard
average. Hogan ran second with 3.1
while Harrison with 2.9 pulled in third.
In his lone run of the contest, Lafferty
got 4.

Nothing has been heard from the Vir-
ginia school but it is expected that they
will have a strong team as they have
in the past.

Dunaj Takes Second Place As

McFADYEN WINS'’~ THIRD

Davidson To Meet Duke In Sec-
ond Engagement, Saturday

Earl Frazier, Wildcat track star, up-
held his reputation of being one of the
best distance runners in the south by tak-
ing first place in the cross-country mect
between Davidson and Washington and
Lee, held on the latter’s course Saturday
afternoon,

In this race the Wildcat star defeated
Dunaj, the General’s ace courser, and
Southern Conference cross-country record
holder. His winning time for the event
was about four seconds behind the
Davidson school record which is held by
him, but the course at the Virginia school
is quite hilly and consequently much more
difficult to travel. Frazier’s time Satur-
day was 16 minutes and 3 seconds, and
Dunaj went the route in 16:23.

The Wildcat won the meet by a 22-36
score, the lower count, of course, being
that of the winner.

The men placed in the following order :
1. Frazier (D); 2. Dunaj (W&L); 3.
McFadyen (D); 4. Kingsbury (W&L);
5. Gullette (D); 6. Merchant (D); 7.
Bell (D); 8 Brown (D); 9. Masengale
(W&LY; 10, Carll (W&L); 11. Ballard
(W&L); 12.. Sproul (W&L).

Gullette and Merchant tied for fifth
place and Masengale and Carll crossed
the line together for ninth place, but
they were counted in the order given so
the score could be properly computed.

According to Coaches Pritchett and
Whittle, the running of McFadyen was
particular pleasing. This is decidedly
the best time this runner has chalked up
in his four years of experience on the
track at Davidson and he is being looked
to as a running mate for the indefatig-
able Frazier, The lanky long-winded
Wildcat covered the three miles at Wash-
ington and Lee in 16:47, a time that
boosted the hopes of the Davidson men-
tors very much, Y

Billy Merchant who was out most of

last year with a sprained ankle has been
coming along very nicely this season and
should be back into as good shape as ever
before the fall schedule is completed. In
the fall of 1932°he ran second to Frazier
in the Freshman Cake-Race, and all of
his.first year he took second in practical-
ly every race in which he took part.
he coaches have been more or less
disturbed over the fact that only six,men
have reported for the cross-country team
this fall. The usual size-of a team is
seven men, and consequently, it is rather
embarrassing for the tutors when they
are unable to enter more than six men
in the meets.
In their next meet of the fall the
Wildcats will engage the Duke Universi-
ty Blue Devils. This will probably be
the hardest encounter of the season. It
will take place in Durham Saturday,
November 10th.
