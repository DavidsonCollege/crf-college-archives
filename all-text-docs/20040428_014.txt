DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER =

GUEST HOUSE BASEMENT-A report
issued by the anthropology department
this week yielded startling results: Public
Displays of Affection, commonly known
as PDAs, have increased dramatically
across campus throughout the past
month. Davidson students everywhere
can now be seen touching, kissing and
fondling each other in full, disgusting
view of public.

“It’s getting somewhat out of hand,”
commented student researcher Amanda

months PDAs are relatively
not existent, when the cold
weather, midterms, and girls
who wear sweaters drive cam-
pus libidos into near hiberna-
tion. But now with the onset of
spring, inhibitions are being
let out—and let outdoors.”
The results are, in fact, star-
tling. As a simple afternoon

be seen awkwardly displaying
their affections from the Carolina Inn to
the Stowe tennis hut, where they engage
in such report-cited examples as the
“swinging hand hold,” the “hallway hug”
and the “Chambers lawn face-suck.”

Some displays are not as straight for-
ward. In a rare occurrence, two students
skipping out of a British literature class
were later found making out in the
Watson Science courtyard, in a PDA cur-
rently being termed the “Dana Cop-a-
Feel.”

According to the report, the Davidson
~ community is at particular risk for being
grossed out by PDAs.

New ‘Davidson AC’ to ease |

crushing pain of campus life

It’s no secret that the end of the se-
mester means the end of the rope for
many at Davidson. Between exams, fi-
nal papers, and flagging Ber Folds
ticket sales, it’s easy to think there’s
simply no hope in sight.

Well now there is. This semester 14
senior biology majors worked in con-
junction with campus health center
doctors to create Davidson AC, a drug
that promises to greatly alleviate the
crushing sense of despair associated
with the end of spring semester on
campus.

Coming in liquid, pill and supposi-
tory form, Davidson AC is the new all-
purpose solution to on-campus dol-
drums, allowing students of all majors
to better tolerate endless studying in

the library, strenuous typing in com-
puter labs, and the constant, crushing
sense of profound grief brought on by
end of the year academics.

Specific benefits include a noted de- .
crease in heartburn and headaches, an
increased ability to pull consecutive all-
nighters, and the instilling of an over-
all general sense that studying on the
first floor of the library is in reality a
very big waste of time.

“The hell with No-doz, Davidson AC
is the stuff,” said test subject Ryan
Mastey ’07. “This case alone should get
me through P-Chem.”

Pending FDA approval, Davidson
AC should be available in the bookstore
and campus health center by the start
of next week. - Colin Eagan

Campus PDAs on the rise

Fact: 60% of Davidson Students marry other Davidson Students

“At most colleges and universities, in-
creased springtime PDAs aren’t quite as
puke-inducing, because students are gen-
erally more open with their feelings to
begin with,” commented Green. “But with
a student body as sexually-repressed as
Davidson’s, it’s a sure-fire recipe for some
ass-awkward jug groping. As I’m sure I
don’t have to tell you.”

The particularly awkward nature of
Davidson PDAs has been noted by stu-
dents across campus. “Yeah, it’s pretty
sick,” said Brian Karob ’06. “This guy and
girl were definitely tickling each other out
on the Union patio this afternoon, just as
I’m trying to eat my fish sandwich. I mean
seriously, get a room. You can’t even eat a
fish sandwich in peace around here any-
more.”

“Oh and I know these two Young Life
leaders who, get this, s77/ed at each other
on the way to class today,” continued
Karob. “I don’t have tell you there was
some blushing that followed that one.”

Alex Yelbis ’05 has also had an un-
pleasant experience.

“One of my pod mates in Tomlinson
has some religious rule that he can’t be in
the same room with his girlfriend because
he won't be able to control himself. Which
is fine, except that it means he’s been
making out 24-7 in our freaking common
room. I must say it’s been a pretty effec-
tive form of birth control for the rest of
us.”

Added Yelbis: “At least they weren’t
bear-hugging in front of CoHo, like I
found them doing last Tuesday. Damn
near called the Park Service.”

Others seem confused by the PDAs that
have unrepentantly come their way. “My
friend Robbie came in from Crew this af-
ternoon wearing his new full-length
spandex suit and tackled me right there
on my bedroom floor,” commented Matt
Otagel ’04. “Which is strange, because I’m
definitely a guy. But I can’t honestly say I
didn’t enjoy it. Actually, we went at it for

close to fifteen minutes.”

According to most recent indications,
there is little hope for any relief in PDAs,
which are expected to rise throughout the
next month, before drastically dropping
off some time around the end of exams.

For concerned students, the report
does recommend avoiding PDA-friendly

locations on campus, such as the big tree
behind Belk, the 24-hour computer lab
door alcove, and that wall between
Sentelle and Cannon.

“There’s unfortunately not much the
average student can do to lessen the ef-
fects of PDAsPshort of carrying around a
bucket of cold water and some Tums,”
commented Green.

“As for you PDAers out there, I have
two words for you: I-Mac Field.”

The Davidsonian

Watts resident
hits floor after
two beers

By Bron TENNIS
Staff Writer

KA House-Freshman Douglas Reuter
drew the attention of many party-goers
Saturday night when he passed out after
consuming two Coors Lites. A resident of
Watts Hall—a substance-free dormitory—
Reuter found himself unable to stay
awake after a long night of partying and
heavy drinking.

Fellow students began to notice the
inebriated Reuter around midnight while
he lay drooling on a couch cushion in the
back of KA.

Junior fraternity brother Laird Cooper
commented on the spectacle, “I saw a
large group of people huddled around
something so I ran over to check it out.
Turns out some train-wreck passed out on
one of our filthy couches.”

Reuter admitted to having lost control
over the course of the night. “Since it was
Spring Frolics I figured I’d let loose and
have a few sips of my friend’s beer. Un-
fortunately, a few sips turned into 7 or 8.
Everything kind of went blurry from
there.”

After finishing his second beer, Reuter
humiliated himself by dancing spastically
and trying to climb up on stage with the
band. -

“Doug just wasn’t himself that night,”
said friend and fellow Watts resident
Phillip McQueen. ”“Normally he’s pretty
shy and soft-spoken, but tonight he kept
initiating conversations with girls he
didn’t know and telling me I was the best
friend ever.”

Thoroughly embarrassed by his behav-
ior Saturday night, Reuter promised him-
self on Sunday that he would never binge-
drink again. “I used to take pride in being
part of the 17 percent. But I’m not so sure
I deserve to belong to that proud elite any-
more. By finishing that second beer I let
down my loyal friends in Watts.”

“Not to mention,” added Reuter, “this
hangover is killing me.””
