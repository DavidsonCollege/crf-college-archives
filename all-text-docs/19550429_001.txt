Marlin Announces [

Extensive Plans for
Dorm Renovation

Treasurer D. Grier Martin has
announced that Davidson College
plans a very extensive program of
dormitory renovation this summer.

With the completion of Belk
Dormitory this summer, Davidsog
will no longer have use for his-
toric Carolina Inn and Georgia
Dormitory. Present plans call for
the destruction of Georgia, and
the use of the first floor of Caro-
lina Inn as a club room for teen-
agers. an

For the past two years the col-
lege has set aside funds in order
to improve the older dormitories
and make them compare more fa-
vorably with the new Belk Dormi-
tory.

Main projects will be the paint-
ing of the interior of West, and
the installation of “Marble” lino-
leum in the rooms and corridors of
Watts and East. Before this lino-
leum can be installed, the floors
must be firmly fastened to the
cement girders supporting them.

A new process called “Ramset,”
which works on the same principle
as a rifle and shoots a steel bar
into the girder, will simply this
work, In addition to these improve-
ments, the front room in each of
these three dorms is to be a re-
ception room for visitors.

Besides actual work on the
dormitories, workmen will fill in
the area around Belk and build
walks after the ground is land-
scaped. Improvements will also in-
clude the parking areas.

Phi Betes Initiate;
Dr. Johnson Speaks

Last Tuesday night the North
Carolina Gamma Chapter of Phi
Beta Kappa held its most important
meeting of the spring term, with
the initiation of new members and
the annual public address.

The eight students who had been
elected recently were formally
initiated at this time. They were
Roy Davis, Floyd Feeney, Linny
Baker. Maurice Crouse, Brown
Goehring. Bill Kuykendall, Jason
MeManus and Clyde Robinson.

Following the initiation, at 7:30
a banquet was held in the College
Union. Approximately 70 guests
were present, primarily members
from the Davidson community, but
also about 20 members and their
guests from the surrounding area.

At 9:00 o’clock Dr. Gerald White
Johnson delivered an address to
the general public on “The Pro-
vineial Scholar.”

lege Church.

A group of distinguished ministers selected from the

major denominations represented in the Student Body will
be on campus to discuss with students the problems and chal-
lenges facing ministers of the Christian Gospel and related
fields. However, the meeting is in no way restricted to those
who have made a definite decision to enter the ministry, but
is open to everyone considering it.

Conceived as a mere possibility
some months ago by students, this
event is the restit of unselfish
work and prayers of dedicated stu-
dents. When the plan was sub-
mitted to the administration, it
was enthusiastically accepted and
has received full cooperation and
support from the administrative of-
Ficers.

Approximately one hundred stu-
dents have registered for the meet-

French Lady Is Guest
As Harmon Prances

Looks of surprise and delight
crossed the faces of the members
of Le Cercle Francais as they
entered the living room of the
Goldiere house and were intro-
duced to a most attractive and
vivacious young French lady “qui
s’ appelle Sabine Blanchard.”

Sabine, who is visiting friends
in Charlotte and is taking several
courses at Queens, was the special
guest of the French Club at their
bi-monthly meeting held Tuesday
evening, April 19. It was surprising
to note how many members made
an appearance at the meeting (one
had not come in two years) when
they learned we were to be
honored with Mlle. Blanchard’s
presence.

After, many furtive glances and
tie-loosenings. the meeting was be-
gun with M. Harmon presiding.
Due to the absence of the secre-
tary, the evening’s program was
begun with a delightful comedy
by Octave Mirbeau, “Scruples.”

Davidson Grad Rate
Good in Med School

‘Seventy-eight per cent of David-
son graduates in medical schools
rate academically in the upper two-
thirds of their class. This is the
word received in Dr. Cunningham's
letter from an agency which
gathers the data setting forth the
accomplishments of the students
of various medical schools of the
nation.

The total number of Davidson
graduates upon whom reports were
given individualy was 107. This
number does not include reports
from several large medical schools,
nor is the present first-year class
included.

The percentage breakdown by
thirds is as follows: top third, 39%;
middle third, 40«; ; low third, 22%.
There have been several voluntary
withdrawals but only in one case
has there been a failure.

’ Those of the present Davidson
generation who have been stirred
by the intensity, humility, ‘genu-
ineness and consecrated power of
Peter Marshall. as recorded in the
book and film version of A Man
Called Peter and in Mr. Jones,
Meet the Master, are but re-echo-
ing the reactions of their prede-
cessors of the 1930's and early ‘40's,
who were likewise enkindled by the
dynamic personality and the in-
spired utterances of this man of
God on the occasion of his several
visits in the flesh to the Davidson
eampus.

While still a student at Columbia
Theological Seminary, Peter
Marshall first came to Davidson on
Sunday, March 20, 1931—only a
few months before his graduation
from Columbia—as a member of
a deputation team.

Even though there were in the
group two recent Davidson grad-
uates, it was not they who im-
pressed the audience, but rather it
was, according to the contemporary
record, “Mr. Marshall’s inspiring
address ... given in his rich
Scotch brogue,”- which “from the
first,” held “the attention of every-
one.”

During his speech he used—per-
haps for the first time in Ameri-
ca—his ilustration of the returned
missionary from China, to which
he refers in his sermon “The Tap
on the Shoulder.” He closed his
first Davidson address with the
thought that “there is such a per-
fect peace and realm of happiness
in a complete resignation to God's
will.” How prophetic of his later
career as pastor, preacher and
chaplain was this early utterance!

“THE LOVELINESS OF HER VOICE. . ”

NUMBER 23

Artist Series To Present
Blanche Thebom May 6

By OUNBAR OGDEN

“From Canton, Ohio, to New York is better than a short
sleeper jump. Sometimes it takes a singer years to make the
trip—career bent, that is. Some singers never make it. But in
the Town Hall last evening, Blanche Thebom, a tall and beautt-
ful mezzo-soprano from Canton, proved that she had been
away too long from the center of musical things.”

This was Robert Bagar's (music
critic forthe New York World
Telegram) comment on Blanche
Thebom's New York debut in 1944.

On Friday, May 6, at 8:15 p.m.,
the mezzo-soprano of. the Metro-
politan Opera Company, Blanche
Thebom, will be heard in a con-
cert in Chambers Auditorium in
conjunction with the Artist Series.

Bagar went on to speak of “the
loveliness of her voice, the intelli-
gence of her singing and the flash
and spirit of her stage personality”
with the suggestion: “It would do
the Metropolitan no harm to look

FEATURE BY DR. GEORGE B. WATTS:

Peter Marshal Frequent
Visitor To College Campus

He was also a member of the
seminary quartet, ‘well known in
the South,” of which he wrote in
a touching Mother's Day letter to
his mother in Scotland. (See A Man
Called Peter, p. 33).

Those who remember his first
appearance, here recall his Scotch
burr, his well-worn, tweedy clothes,
but, sbove all, his contagious en-
thusiasm and sincerity’

Peter Marshall's second trip to
Davidson was on February 10,
1935, when he spoke in the morn-
ing at the College Church on “The
Church Asks Youth: ‘So What?'”
and at the evening YMCA vespers.
His sermon, “The Cock Crew,”
made a “strong appeal to the Da-
vidson student body.” He was
“well received by both the students
and the faculty,” said the Oavid-
sonien reporter.

He was at that time pastor of
the Westminster Presbyterian
Church of Atlanta, where, we read,
he had “probably the largest
crowds for his night services of
any church in Atlanta.”

During the fall of the same year
he returned to the campus as the
leader of the YMCA fall services,
from October 28 through 31. An

tadvanced notice published in the

Davidsonien said: “Marshall is a
very popular speaker and received
great acclaim when he spoke here
last February.” This article also
calls attention to the fact that he
was also “conducting three other
groups of fall vesper services
similar to this one.”

He spoke at the morning chapel
services, which were “extended”
in order that he “might not be

into the situation.”

The Metropolitan did, and the
next December, less than a year
after her debut, made her bow on
the stage of the old opera house.

After completing the spring por-
tion of her second national con-
cert tour during the 1945-46 sea-
son, she was heard in a number of
important radio assignments such
as the Telephone Hour and the .
RCA Hour, before reporting to the
Met. That season was also marked
by Mademoiselle Magazine's selec.

and at vespers. He also had many
personal conferences with students
during his stay.

Of this series of meetings the
editorial writer of the Davidsenlen
said, on October 30, 1935: “Rev.
Peter Marshall's inspiring and
thought provoking messages . .
will long be remembered by those
who heard him. Davidson is indeed
fortunate to have such an. appeal-
ing personality to conduct this
group of annual revival services.”

Dr. Marshall’s last appearance
here was during the late fall of
1941, a month before Pearl Har.
bor. On November 5-7 he was once
more in charge of the YMCA Serv-
ices. He visited in the homes of
several members of the faculty
and the fraternity and boarding
houses. On November 5 he met
with the YMCA cabinet.

During this series he spoke on
“Choosing the Twelve," “Man's
business is Duty, and God's is Des-
tiny,” “Who is eccentric?” “When
is man a hero?” and “Don't put off
until tomorrow what you can do
today.” The Devidsenien writer on
November 12 again stressed his
“Scotch accent,” and his “earnest
delivery.” “Much was gained by
everyone in helping the students
decide how to choose the better
way,” said the Davidsenien, ap-
parently with conviction, if not in
the purest English style. At the
conclusion of Peter Marshall's last
sermon, Dr. Cunningham “ex-
pressed his desire that the Fall
Services weren’t over, but that the
students would keep them forever
in their hearts,” wrote the re-

cramped for time while speaking,” | porter.
