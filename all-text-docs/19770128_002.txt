The Davidsonian

Two hundred and fifty-eight
men and women from North
Carolina and Florida have
been nominated for the first
Edward Crosland Stuart
Scholarships.

Twelve will be chosen as
Stuart Scholars. From those
twelve, two will be given a
grant regardless of need in the
amount of $3000. The other
ten will each be given a $500
grant.

Dean of Admissions H.
Edmunds White said that the
purpose of the program was
‘to attract some truly out-
standing people who might

not otherwise consider David-
son.’

These students were nomin-
ated by their high school prin-
cipals and head masters and
now must go through a screen-

ing process that will select 36
students to go on to district
competition.

On the district level each
candidate is interviewed and
twelve candidates are selected
for the final competition which
will be held at Davidson in late
March. Final decision will be
announced around April 1.

According to the pamphlet
describing the scholarship, the
qualities of a Stuart Scholar
are ‘‘Christian character.

White indicated that the
program will be reevaluated in
the spring. At that time the
Board of Directors will con-
sider whether or not to expand
the program to other states
and also decide whether or not
to increase the number of
scholars selected.

The Stuart Scholarship has

often been compared to the
Morehead Scholarship prog-
ram at the University of North
Carolina.

When asked if the elitism
that often characterizes the
Morehead Scholarship will be
a feature of the program at
Davidson, White said, ‘‘In all
the discussions that I’ve been
involved in there has been no
mention of it. I’m satisfied
that in my estimation it won’t

happen,’ he said.

Regarding the question of
financial need White indicated
that hé had some reservations
about the fact that the pro-
gram awards scholarships re-
gardless of need.

But he defended the prog-
ram, comparing it to the
basketball scholarships, which
are not necessarily awarded on
the basis of need.

SGA irons out media board

By TRACY UPCHURCH
Staff Writer
During a very intense meet-
ing the Senate elected junior
Bert Downs and sophomore
Greg Hankins to the Student
Media Board.

The Media Board Screening
Committee had earlier re-
viewed several candidates, ap-
proved Downs, Hankins, and
Philip Duncan for Senate con-
sideration.

Calling the Media Board,
“‘awful damn important’’,

SGA President Thom Young

asked Screening Committee

Chairman Jeff Sich to explain
his committee’s work. The
Board will oversee all student
publications and WDAV and
will set important precedents
for future boards.

The Board will consist of
nine members; at least three of
which will be students. Mat-
thew Covington, chosen by
the Publications Board, is the
other student: representing
student media. Three mem-
bers will be picked from the
college at large and three will
be from the administration
and faculty.

Two issues aroused a great

deal of debate in the Senate.
One issue involved charges of
conflict of interest involving
Downs who works for WDAV
and Duncan who is Co-News
Editor of The Davidsonian.
The Senate decided a conflict-
of-interest would only involve
an editor-in-chief applying for
a seat on the Board.

Lynn Langley (’79) charged
that the Screening Committee
acted improperly in rejecting
certain candidates. She made
the motion that the election of
the Board members be tabled.

The motion was defeated 10
to 7.

Percy Badham (Belk),
member of the Screening Com-
mittee, said the ideal represen-
tative for the Media Board
would be an ‘‘open-minded,
common sense’”’ type person.

Downs, who was elected
with 12 votes, wants the new
group to establish a ‘‘respon-
sible code of conduct’.

Hankins, seated with 13
votes, would like to see the
Board’s jurisdiction extended
to cover all college publica-
tions.

Freshman Tom Mahoney
was chosen by the Senate
Executive Committee to be-
come the SGA Chancellor,
replacing Sam Crawford.
Crawford, who was praised by
Hans Watford (Sentelle) as,
“one of the most efficient
people I’ve met in my life,’’ is
resigning to devote time to
other projects.

Due to the length of the
meeting stemming from the
Media Board controversy, dis-
cussion of Senate committee
goals was postponed’ until
next week.
