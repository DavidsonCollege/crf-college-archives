Athletic council discusses new track possibilities

ever, that the plans are still in the
developmental stage.

Assistant Athletic Director
Sterling Martin says that during
the late 1980s the Trustee
Committee’s Council on Athletic
’ Policy had already begun to con-
sider renovating what was identi-
fied as a very dilapidated
Richardson Field track. But under
the leadership of then athletic di-
rector Terry Holland, the Council
decided to use funds earmarked
for track repair for soccer field
renovations instead, so as to attract
the NCAA Division I Soccer
Championship Committee to
Davidson.

“Right now we’re still col-
lecting input and pricing out possi-
bilities,” says Murphy. Murphy
says that while some funds may be
siphoned from Davidson’s capital
campaign, the bulk of the track
project funding must come from
private donations.

_when Davidson was selected to

host the 1992 NCAA Division I
Soccer Championships.

Construction work was sub-
sequently required to modify the
dimensions of Richardson Field in
preparation for the event. As a
result of the construction work,
Davidson’s track lost three of its
six lanes.

“We knew that by making that
decision, we would consequen-
tially force the issue of what to do
with the track,” says Martin.

The Richardson Field track
originally consisted of four lanes.
In 1974, anew rubberized asphalt
surface was laid down and the track
grew to six lanes.

Over its history, the six lane
Davidson track played host to the
Southern Conference Champion-
ships and Davidson Relays.

Current Southern Conference
athletic regulations require an eight
lane track.

Parking fee hike
remains a mystery

By IAN HuMMEL

In response to the clamor that
has surrounded parking problems
at Davidson this year, the SGA set
an agenda for an Ad Hoc Commit-
tee on Parking by which student
complaints would be reviewed and
the findings would be submitted to
school administration.

However, this committee has
been largley unsuccessful due to
lack of response from Vice
Presicent for Business and Finance
Robert Norfleet.

The agenda included discus-
sions with Norfleet on the topic of
the increase in car registration and
with Public Safety Director Ray
Thrower on the reasons for the

better explanation of such a sig-
nificant price increase than that it

was a contribution to the “general

fund.”

Thrower explained that the
parking spaces that were elimi-
nated behind Belk Dorm and
Johnston Gym had been in conflict
with either the fire code or ADA
regulations. ©

In addition, the subcommittee

on parking will conduct a survey -

of the campus regarding student
opinions on the parking situation,
and conduct research in conjunc-
tion with the administration on the
parking fees and problems at other
schools.

The parking survey is pres-
ently being conducted under the
supervision of senior Jonathan

Says Andrew, “The track is
long overdue for replacement.
Right now our practices are really
crowded and hectic.”

Andrew says that the absence
of a home track has hurt recruiting
efforts and also caused the
program’ s travel expenses to esca-
late significantly.

Davidson track & field team
member Michael Albert says the
current track is nothing short of a
safety hazard: “We have guys ic-

. ing down injuries after every prac-

tice.” Most everyone involved in
the track & field program agrees
that the lack of a home track has
hurt team morale. :

Says Albert, “It’s lonely com-
peting .on the road all the time
without any fans.”

This Tuesday, the SGA will
propose to form a committee to
work with admissions on the issue.

A crack in the really old track.
