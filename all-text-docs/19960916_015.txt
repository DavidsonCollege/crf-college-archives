To add scoring punch to an
offense that had mustered only
three goals in it’s first three games,
coach Kevin Hundley moved
sweeper Amy Balsinger into the
midfield during the Sheraton Tour-
nament at James Madison this
weekend. In Friday’s 1-0 win over
Princeton, it paid off.

With 4:23 remaining,
Balsinger broke through the
Princeton defense, knocking home

the game-winner.

Goalkeeper Allison Noznesky
had another standout day for the
Wildcats, recording 12 saves en
route to her first shutout of the
season.

“We had some chances and
didn’t score. They had some
chances and didn’t score. It was an
even game, and!’ mreally pleased,”
Hundley said. “We made the switch
and she got the game-winner.
Hopefully we can keep things go-
ing against Maryland (the #6 team
in the nation).”

But Maryland had other plans.
The Terrapins opened the game on
a rampage, notching two goals in
their first four shots, and they held
a4-O advantage by the 25th minute.
They held on for-a 4-1 win.

“They really took ittous early.
They looked like the #6 team in the
country and we looked confused at
times,” Hundley said. “But we
brought in our normal substitu-
tions, and they had watched what
Maryland was doing. They played
really well.”

So well that the Wildcats

ended up outshooting and
outscoring Maryland in the second
half. Early in the period, Natalie
Stumpf stole the ball and found
Ginny Dye at the top of the penalty
area. Dye turned and drove the ball
past the Maryland keeper for her
second goal of the season.
Freshman Chesley Garret also
saw her first action in goal, shut-
ting out Maryland in the second
half. It was the first time since
1994 that Noznesky came out.

“We played together in high,

school,” Noznesky said of Garret.
“We work well together and it’s
fun to have her around, She’s also
the most experienced keeper we’ ve
ever had coming in. She pushes me
a lot in practice and we should be
sharing a lot of time this year.”

The Princeton win followed
the team’s 4-1 loss at #9 Clemson
on Monday.

“They had:a lot of speed, and
midfielder Beth Keller is a good
distributor, but we went in expect-
ing a harder game,” Kelly Rennick
said. “The score was not telling of
the game. It was not a 4-1 game
and I don’t quite know how to
explain it.”

Clemson grabbed two goals
in the first three minutes of play.
Early in the second minute, Sara
Burkett converted a penalty kick
for the Tigers. Less than a minute
later Burkett played acorner intoa
crowd at the goal-mouth. The ball
slipped past Noznesky into the back
corner of the goal, giving Clemson
a 2-0 lead.

In the 12th minute, Amy

Kanoff knocked a restart to the
backside of the goal where Rennick
headed it home to bring the score
to 2-1. They connected in a similar
fashion for the game-tying goal in
the team’s season-opening win
over South Carolina.

“Crosses are something I
worked on a lot in high school,”
Kanoff said. “We’ve never had
such an exceptional player in the
air as Kelly (Rennick). We work
on that in practice. We’ve both
found our strengths.”

ButClemson put the lead back
at two when Keller scored in the
31st minute off across from Jenni-
fer Crawford. The ball got past
Noznesky, and Keller was able to
collect it, beat a would-be tackler,
and play the ball into an empty net.
With 50 seconds remaining,
Clemson got another goal to com-
plete the scoring.

“This was a very competitive
match. Davidson got in a bind
quickly, but they never stopped
plugging away and made it a very
competitive match. That’s nice to
see from our stand point,” center
referee Joe Morgalis said.

“We were beaten by two top
ten teams this week,” Hundley said.
“But we scored legitimate goals
against them, and played with them
even for long stretches, even when
their starters were playing. Now
we’ ve got to figure out how to play
as a group for 90 minutes and get a
little lucky. We have two more
chances against teams of that cali-
ber at N.C. State (Sept. 30) and
UNC Greensboro (Oct. 2).”

Smith said with a grin.

Ona penalty stroke, Davidson freshman Kate Schoening scored
the only goal of Sunday’s away game to defeat archrival App. St.

“App. St. lives, eats, breathes, and dreams to beat us,” head coach
Betsy Pryor said in August. The mountaineers will have to keep
dreaming until Oct. 27 when the two teams rematch on the Wildcat’s

One of Pryor’s preseason concerns was playing on artificial turf,
which is quicker than grass. This weekend’s game proved that her
team can play at their best on any surface, even though this game was

A new tule this season eliminates off-sides penalties. It is
intended to quicken play even more and increase scoring.
“Forwards can just camp out next to the goal now and wait for the
ball,” Erin Smith commented on the new rule. The strategy of the
defense has changed now that the offense is always poised to shoot.
Captain Mary Dowd and goalkeeper Sara Gebhardt anchored
Davidson’s defense, keeping App. St. scoreless. Then, toward the end
of the game, Laura Rosenbach was fouled by the Appalachian goalie
in the circle, letting Schoening take the shot on goal that won the game.
“This was a huge win because it determines rankings for the
postseason Deep South Tournament. We’re number one right now,”

Keeping up with Jones’ knee

Maryville, Tenn. - Big tight end
Wes Jones went down with a knee
injury in the fourth quarter and
didn’t return. X-rays revealed no
fracture, but he will. have an MRI
today to determine whether there
is any ligament damage.

“It’s really sore. I kind of
buckled it under when I was block-
ing,” said Jones yesterday. He
added that he didn’t hear the char-
acteristic pop of an ACL tear.

“He was a real factor in the

’ first half,” said Maryville coach

Phil Wilks of Jones. “He was
really manhandling our outside
linebacker.”

Volleyball stumped in invitational

By Drew WILLIAMS

The volleyball team must have
had a serious case of deja vu as
they left Belk arena Saturday night.

Last weekend in Memphis the
Wildcats lost four games, and this
weekend they dropped another
four, with losses against Mercer,
UNC Wilmington, Radford and
Wake Forest in the Davidson Clas-
sic to fall to 2-9.

The Wildcat woes began
against Mercer on Friday after-
noon. Leading 7-1 in the first
game, the Wildcats couldn’t hold

onto the lead and wound up losing -

15-13. The second game was a
loss, 15-9, and the third game ended
in a heartbreaking 16-14 defeat.

“We had a lot of great effort,
but we just couldn’t finish,” said
coach Radford. “We have to stay
encouraged, and the finishing part
will come.”

Friday night’s match versus
UNC Wilmington lasted four
games, with L.A. Bumgarner and
Janet Duncan teaming up for 23
kills, and freshman Ginny Quis
leading the team with 25 assists.

Saturday’s match pitted the
Wildcats against Radford. The
Highlanders defeated the Wildcats
15-8, 15-4, 15-2.

In the nightcap against Wake
Forest, the Wildcats were again
beaten in three quick games.

“We are not the type of team

that is going to get down on our-
selves,” said junior co-captain L.A.
Bumgarner, “and you can already

see a huge improvement over last
year’s team.”
