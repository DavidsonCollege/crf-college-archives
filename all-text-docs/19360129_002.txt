Paragraphics....

Ahsmni Secretary. Grier Martin should be con-
gratulated for obtaining @ titteen minute radio
program to be broadcast trom the Davidson cam
“pus over the southern network of the Columb:a
broadcasting system. This gives cach week vo the:
college a very intimate contacc wiut the entire
Southland.

“The Davidson Pan Hellenic Couneil should be
commended jor its untiting etions and find suc-
cess in securing the musie of such an unusually
good orchestra as reddy Martin for the Mid-
Winter danees, +

Undoubtedly they imow a good deal more about
contracts, weather insurance, and most of all how
much peopie.enjoy enucising. since beginning
their plans tor these dances.

Freshmen Franchise....

Several years ago a conscientious but misin-
formed stadom body took @ step toward election
reform hy giving Davidson democracy a death
blow, This step inyolved depriving the Freshman
Cass of the franchise in.all student body clections
until the selection of their class president had been
completed. As this clection is always the last
of the season it anerely means removing trom
the Freshmen all use of the ballot. {t seems now
that this step was taken without due consider-
ation by the leg:siative ody. The originator of
the proposal helicved that removing treshmen
votes would act to two advantages :

(1) fe. would cfiminate votes by men who
have not oeen in Davidson lomg enouglh to know
the candidates or their qualifications for office.

(2) Ji would eliminate the possibility of un-
due pressure upon individuals in theit votiag by
their fraternities or other groups. |

We will not refute the first reason or expatiate

on upperclassmen who vote for men they do not
know or transfer students who are usually not
afforded the opportunities that Orientation and
rushing season afford for (reshmen to meet upper-
classmen. Iu regard to the second suggestion, it
may he said that unscrupuloms voters may be
found in any class, and that, freshmen will not
be more inciined to vote uncer pressure than
upperclassmen of the true Davidson calibre,

TO remedy this situation it has been “suggested
that the vote be given the freshmen in limited de-
gree, namely, each freshman vote would count
one half value of an upperclassman ballot. This
would meet the objections offered by the propon-
ents of the defranchising movement, and at the
same time would answer the advantages Isited
below :

(1) Restoration of the freshman
would build student body unit.

(2) . Freshmen in some cases know 1 more of
the qualifications of some candidates than any
other men in the student body. Cheerleader is an
example of this.

(3) In the name of democracy such segrega-

leges in the country, characterizing them as the
seed beds of leadership and “among the principal
suurees. of high character and nolile ideals with-
out which any purely economic system would
collapse,” they voice opinion in which leading
inipartial educators strongly coneur.

Fhe small liberal arts colleges hawe usually hac:
w travel a read of thorns and obstacles. Their
encowments at best have been incager. They
posses only one fourth of the capital funds dchind
all higher educational institutions, large and small
in the United States, and they inciude in their
cloisters one halt of the students. While large
universities have been spending huge sums in
extravagantly beautitying and enlarging their phy -
sical aspects. the small colleges have carried on
with scant funds that do not even suifiee to pay
their faetities fair salaries. The present period

Distinetly American in nature. the small liberal
arts college truly plays a most imponant role in
the American educational system. Amid the
srowth of state-supported institutions and highly-
endowed universities, the smaller eollege has held
on as one of the strongholds of a truiv cultural’
education. The broad opportunities which it Sf-
ters for intimacy and for inereased student fac-
uly fellowship have demonstrated the value of
The recent sctusion
within several large institutions of a number
ot smaller divisions, such as the colleges. in the

the small coliege over the large educational plants.
Yet the great Sulk of these smaller institutions,
along with the caually neglected women’s colleges,
ate torecd to struggle along. leading av hand-to-
mouth existence, while a few major institutions
grow relatively opulent.”

Kegret is naturally occasioned by the fact that
America’s larger institutions caanot secure all the
financial backing they could use to increase the
salaries of faculty members or «© erect luxurious
Gothie and Gregorian buildings. But the plight of
America's scores of worthy but financial starving
colleges, particularly prevalent in the South and
in certain portions of the West, brings to the sur-
face one of the most pressing needs of modern
American higher education.—The Daily Prince-
tonian.

tion is unfair. Evolution is natural, and.is neces-
sary tor improvement. We believe that the col-
lege student of this generation is in many respects
more broadminded and democratic than his pre-
decessors. Such practices as hazing and “‘Yiitting”
aré going imto rapid disuse in contemporary col-
legiate circles. Reforms have been made, and
are beingymade in this phase of freshman life at
Davidson. Several groups of Davidson men now
have as an objective broadening the scope of
freshman life. By careful consideration and sin-
cere support the student body can build greater
unity of campus thought and expression through
this and other forthcoming proposals.

ALL'S DEAD ON
THE WESTERN FRONT

Crowding into all the Southéen
enachines and colleges of learning is
that rather odd specimen known as
the Yankee. Before the Yankee, the
Southerner gapes in awe. Most pe-
cular about the Yankee is his voice,
avhich sounds something like the con-
cise clicking of a pair of sharpened
scissors, ‘To bear a group of Yan-
kees hold forth ig something pheno-

WISE POLICY?

Davidson is cutting its own thedat
as rewards athletics. It seems cer-
tain (wethope so) that we will re-
sist the onslaught of the great ten-
dency toward mass production in
education: one of the features Gf
which is commercialization of ath-
letics. Some schools. should be
called “Associated Gymnasia” rath-
er tMan college or university. But
to resist this tendency and. retain
its individuality, Davidson is bound
to be outclassed completely in foot-
hall and partly in basketball and
baseball. lt should, then, develop
completely the minor non-commer-
cialized sports: track, boxing, Wwrest-
ling, gall, tennis, ete. Emory Uni-
versity — a notable combination of
tne student: personnel and aeade-
mic excellence — has realized thls.
Yet last year we lost Captain ‘Nor-
ton °G, Pritchett, a strong backer
of intramural and minor sports. And
new we note the departure af “Doc”
Unger, who put wrestling on the
map at Davidson and Davidson

Washington, D. C.--The FERA-

WPA Lodge of the, American Fed-
eration of “Government Employees,
after a brie fight lasting onty one
week, succeeded in’ having — their
president, released from whe WPA
two weeks ayo, reinstated m her old
job. The union's suceess surprised
eve its executive officers. They
expeeted opposition from everybody
from Mr. Hlopkins down against re-
instatoment of Miss Richter, alleg-
edly discharged for inefficiency.
They bad ammunition for a long
fight ready, ammunition calculated
to prove that their president’s dis-
charge had been prompted by her
union activities, not by the quality
of her work, which quality they be-
lieved they could prove was excel-
lent.

John Donovan. once the central
figure in a battle between Gen.
tLluzh Johnson and the NRA em-
ployees union, spoke at tthe rally
held. by FERA employees launch-
ing the etfortuto reinstate Miss
Richter. Donovan, during a term
as president for the NKA_ lodge.
was ‘siinilarly discharged, and not
reinstated until the case, brought
before the National Labor LDoard,
was decidtéd tn his favor.

All this serves to illustrate the
point that since the New Deal first
brought youngsters into the service
there has been a growing militancy
in_the government employees un-
ions. The NRA lodge and_ the
FERA-WPA lodge have been out-
standingly pugnacious and outstand-
ingly successful in their battles. The
militancy is directly attributable to
a number of young men and wom-
en, recent college and university
graduates, who organized and now
run both these unions. Many of
them happened to major in labor
economics in their undergraduate
days and now they're not just the-
oreticians but atso able union strat-
egists. The charge among the old
timers is that they're just a bunch
ot young college ‘Kids, “playing ‘un-
ion,’ the way children play at—'sol-
diers’.”

That charge is partially true.
There are a couple of “over the ram-
parts, boys!” people among the
young folks in the new unions of
the New Deal agencies, but most
of them are as hard-headed as the
AFGE president, Clyde Babcock. In
addition they bring to the fight of
the government employees what the
old teaders seem to lack, ingenuity,
persistence, -and_idealistie courage.

With the example of the unions of
these capable young amateurs be-
fore them many old line lodges have

begun to show signs of increasing °
