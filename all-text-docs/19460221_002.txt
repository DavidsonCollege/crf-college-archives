eAidwinters ...

This week-end will find many a David-
son~studentheading toward the gymna=
sium to enjoy the first post-war dances
ever held-on the college campus. The cli-
max of many days and months of prepara-
tion will-have been reached, and everyone
will tind himself admidst a glorious at-
mosphere.

It should be swell having an orchestra
to furnish the music for both nights in-
stead of the usual juke box for the infer-
mal dance. Although very few have ever
heard of Wilson Humber, we look for-
ward to meeting and hearing his orchestra,
and if he lives up to what thousands of
others have said about his orchestra, he
should make @ hit with the student body.
There was some talk at one time of the pos-
sibility of our having Johnny Long for
Midwinters, but it seems as if his price
Were just a little too much for our size
student body to take on at the present. But
Were preity sure in saying that next year
we'll be having several outstanding bands
booked up for our dances, and from then
on out.

Ed Golder, who just recently has assum-

the presidency of the Pan-Hellenic
council, has done a wonderful job in mak-
ing this dance possible. And to the remain-
der of the men serving on the Council, we
extend our heartiest appreciation for the
timewand work they have spent maping

ed

out the plans, decorating the gym, secur-
ing places for the girls to stay, and many
other important things.

Davidson College students, take notice!
This is your dance. It is being given in
your honor, and not for just a select few.
And ‘you're being asked to come, whether
you have a date or not (for what good is
a dance where there’s not a long line of

" stags, and to cooperate in putting over the
top, one of the biggest and best dances the
Pan-Hellenic council has ever sponsored.

If you haven't purchased your ticket yet,
do it right away, for.tomorrow the big
event begins,-and then for two solid days
you'll be having the time of your life. Let’s
see everyone out tomorrow night for the
informal dance and Saturday night for the
formal.

Chraternities ...

During this period of the year when
many men are being initiated into frater-
nities there are some who always wonder,
and not entirely without cause perhaps,
if these organizations are worth what they
cost or if the money put into them is not
at least partially wasted.

We fully realize that any discussion we
might undertake on this subject will be
done with the same security felt by a man
setting out on quicksand, but regardless of
any trepidation we might feel, perhaps
some discussion will not entirely be out of
place. If this turns out to be a defense of
fraternities, it will be based on sincerity,
which neither needs or offers an apology
in spite of the stand taken by some of the
leading educational institutions in the coun-
try.

During the 100 years that fraternities
have been in existence they have collected
enough skeltons in their closets to give their
critics ample grounds to call them sponsers
of football heroes and social go-getters.
Their ‘attitude toward scholarship has been
alluded to as wholly passive, if not uncon-
structive. And the loyalty of the fraternity
has been called narrow and selfish toward
the dishonest or weak brother, and the
iraternity house has been referred to as
a cradle of campus politics. This is not at
alla pretty picture. Nor is it all true, either
of traternities in general or of Davidson
frats in particular. Fortunately there is an
other, truer, side to the picture.

Dr. Fred H. Turner, Dean of Men at
the University of Illinoise, has this to say
about fraternities: “In general the frater-
nity man is democratic. He has nothing to
be high-hat about. He does not have to
come from a wealthy family nor need he
be a good athlete nor the best dresséd man
on the campus. -Inter-fraternity relations

'l are better now than ever before. Many fra-

ternity men work to help pay their way
through college, and the working student
has just as much opportunity to be in a
fraternity as the one who does not work.
Irom the standpoint of the student, the
fraternity is a good institution; from the
standpoint of the parents of the student,
they can feel that their son in a fraternity
is in good hands; from thé standpoint of
the college, the fraternity provides a de-
sirable type of organization which can do
much to make college life better, more
wholesome and more satisfactory.”

The words of this noted educator could
not be improved upon in describing the fra-
ternity situation at Davidson. Here, where
the members do not live in the houses, we
avoid nearly all of those things which have
done so much to give fraternities their
black eyes and have a set-up beneficial to
the college in more ways than one.

Spring “Folidays . ...

Once again Davidson begins the practice
of having Spring Holidays, after having
been eliminated from the college schedule
for the past few years dut to the accel-
erated program being observed by the col-
lege.

The Holidays receive a warm welcome
on the part of the student body, as was
proven by the jubilant action taken by the
students in chapel last Thursday.

For the possibility of our having these
holidays we thank two different groups
of people. First, there is that group that
drew up the petition and circulated it
through the student body, and they deserve
ample appreciation for their work. And,
secondly, there is that group of men on the
faculty and administration who cooperated
with the student body in seeing that we did
have spring holidays this year. We thank

them personally for their supporting the
petition. eS

In “Circlin’ the D” this week, I in-
quired here and there to find out
th@opinions of some of the stu-
dents on the question of what is
needed around the campus. Here
are some of the results of my in-
quisitiveness.

Bill Robertson: “We need more
dances—more social agtivity. I've
been here since December and there
hasn't been’a single social activity
since I got here.”

Lonnie Turner: “We should have
fewer chapel exercises each week—
say only two or three each week.”
Bill McLean: “We need a student
recreation building with a few bowl-
ing alleys, ping pong tables, billiard
tables and a place for fraternities

and other organizations to have
banquets.”

Jimmy Nisbet: “Less outside
parallel reading would be © nice.”

“Another thing that campus needs
is a good campus magazine.”
Pete Sinclain: “Somebody
to clean the place up.”

needs

Amos Ragan and Jimmy French

both insist that the most urgent
need is a new gym.
Charles Thompson would like ‘to
see the restrictions on cars lifted,
even though he’s graduating this
spring.

John Wall: “Get us some
water in Gecrgia Dormitory.”

Jim Alexander: “More con-
venient location for the student
store taking idto consiileratidn that
we already Have our new church
and our new gymnasium.”

Bill Whitaker would like to see
Davidson College provide a good
Pyace to dance on the campus.

Fred Powell and Plato Pearson are
both supporters of the Proposition
for “free use of automobiles.”

Howard Lamar and Martin Pitts
think that the most pressing need
is for the new gym.

Henry Engles believes that Da-
vidson could use a new or better
theatre. The present one is inade-
quate for a normal student body.

hot

Bob Freemon agrees with others
that a “student union” is needed.
The Y.M.C.A, is becoming more
and more inadequate.

Jack Bagley: “Move the ‘Stud’

nearer the dormitories and put a
water fountain in the library.”

Well, that’s that as far as personal
opinions go. If you wish to express
yourself, do it through the Davwid-
sonian, Try writing a letter to the
editor:

The miost popular expressions a-
round the campus this week are, “I
got a date for the dances!” and
“Flushed.” In case’ you aren't fami-
liar with a flush, a flush has been
defined as “a letter, telegram, or
phone call from a dance-set-invited
femme to a local Joe, wherein she
informs him that she will not be
able to attend the dances.” Flushes
usually occur not earlier than two or
three days before the dance and not
later than one hour before the dance
(if you're a lucky person).

The Queens Day-students were
responsible for a bit of relaxation
for a large number of Davidson stu-
dents on February 16. They gave
a wonderful informal dance in the
“rec” room at Queens College. The
boys seemed to forget the woes
(due mainly to flushes) when the
iair-damsels waltzed them around the
floor.

Please allow me to express my
deepest sympathy to the members
of the decorating committee of the
Pan+Hellenic Council. When this
issue of the Davidsonian comes out,
they will be busily engaged in a re-
modeling process. To this group falls
the task of taking the old college
gymnasium and making it into a
ballroom, It can be done but it takes
so-0-o much work: Good luck
fellows. I hope you have plenty of
helpers.

Middy Raynal should be congratu-
lated on his production of “The
Milky Way.” The play was a huge
success. From what I hear, every-
one enjoyed it. The Red and” Black
Masquers came back with a bang
after being silent for two years.

The most wonderful news to hit
the campus in quite some time was
the announcement that the David-
son students will get spring holi-
days this year. They begin on March
28 and last until April 2. These will
be the first spring holidays since
those scheduled for the spring of
1943,
