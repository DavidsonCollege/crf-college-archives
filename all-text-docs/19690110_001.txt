The Academy for Educa-
tional Development (AED).
a nonprofit corporation which
advises educational and oth-
er institutions on ways to
improve operations and to
plan for the future, has been
contracted to make a full-
scale study for Davidson.

President Samuel R. Spen.
cer Jr. made the announce-
ment Thursday.

Spencer, in his installation
speech Oct, 11, had called
for the college to contract an
“outside agency . . . to help
develop an overall design
and to recommend proced-
ures for dealing with such
vital consequential consider-
ations as financial manage
ment and campus develop
“ment.”

After considering several
possibilities, the college ad-
ministration has decided that
the AED would best fulfill its
requirements, the president
said. The academy will also
work with the five study
commissions ‘requested by
the president to investigate
a number of basic questions
facing the college, such as
coeducation and intercollegi-
ate athletics.

The AED plans to deliver
its recommendations Sept. 1
after studies made between
now and June, Spencer not-
ed.

The academy‘s proposal to
Davidson, which the college
has accepted, ‘calls for ‘‘a
comprehensive study which
would examine all aspects of
the college and make detail-
ed recommendations  con-
cerning the college's future.”

Among the areas examined
would be the overall aims
and goals of the college, or-
gaization and administrtion
of the college, faculty re-
sources, business and finan.
cial management. develop-
ment and public relations.
the student situation. public
service, the new curriculum
and new educational oppor-
tunities. facilities and space
utilization, instructional ar-
rangements, utilization of re-
sources, and planning.

Staff members from the
academy office in New York
‘will coordinate the study,
drawing on the advice of a
special team of education
consultants for the project.
Spencer said.

RUSH CONTINUES
reek System Questioned

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Editor-in-Chief

Pondering a two-pronged attack on the fraternity
system, 271 freshmen return to Patterson Court to-
night for the second round of rush parties.

After three more preliminary parties tonight, the
rushees will be issued redate cards tomorrow morn
ing. then go through a third and fourth round of
parties tomorrow afternoon and Sunday afternoon.

Bids will go out Monday morning.

Meanwhile the campaign of the Greeks’ opponents
to present “the other side” has continued. A group
of 37 Inlependents aiming “to present the case for
your being an Independent” distributed the first in
a series of mimeographed letters in the freshman

dorms last night.

The other affront to the fraternity system came
Tuesday in a chapel speech by Student Body President
Joe Murphy, an inactive fraternity member.

Murphy pointed to what he called the ‘absurdity and
artificiality” in the fraternity system, labelling it a
“false crutch.” Rush, he said, is a “brilliant display
of the worst fraternities have to offer.”

Luck, Donations
Hurry Project

‘By ROBERT ELLIOTT
Staff Writer

Within a month perhaps, Davidson will have its own campus

radio station, WDAV FM.

By then, luck, the generosity of an alumnus and the work
of sophomore Ed Dobbs will have been combined to make the

project a reality.

Dobbs said Wednesday that the only thing that is holding

up the station {is its receiv
ing a construction permit
from the Federal Communi-
cations Commission and this
could take a short or long
time.

“It will be a matter of
luck as to when the FCC
handles our application.”
Dobbs said.

The mobile radio unit that
students may have seen
parked near the College
Union was donated by David
son graduate John Trask.
Trask runs’ radio station
WBEU at Beaufort, S. C.

The truck will be stripped
of its equipment, including
its transmitter. Dobbs said,
“We have an offer to buy
the truck. which we hope to
sell for $1.060."" This, along
with a Union grant of another
$1,000. will give the radio
adequate starting capital.

“Next week a form will be
passed out in assembly for
students to give their prefer
ences for station programs.
This poll will determine to
a great extent what type of
programs we will have."
Dobbs said. «

He then added that some
programs will be educational,
but nothing like ‘‘Deutsch
in five easy lessons.”

“One interesting program
we'll have will be ‘Night
Call.” Our station will hook
up with a regular station in
New York.

“This station in New York

will call up some controver
sial figure, and through this
setup any student will be able
fo talk to this guest and ask
him any questions he wants
to." Guests have included
John Lindsey and the late
Martin Luther King Jr.

The stdtion will operate
from the old PRAM office
in the Union. A committee
of five faculty and adminis.
tration members. and four
students form the board of

Citing the “overpowering influence of the prevailing ©
opinion in a fraternity,” exclusiveness, and the “di-
visiveness” that fraternities produce within the student
body, Murphy called for another solution to the
“problem of social life at Davidson.”

_“Enough time has already been spent formulating
piecemeal, stop-gap measures designed to save fra-
ternities, not to solve the problem of social life at
Davidson.

“It is up to us now to work together, not as frater-
nity men or Independents, but as Davidson students,
to find and implement the best possible solution to the
problems of social organization and social life.”

The Independents’ letters to the freshmen are an
effort to ‘present a balanced picture,” leader Peter
Hobbie told a group of some three dozen Independents
and ex-fraternity members Monday night.

“Some of it (the material in the letters) is tongue-
in-cheek, some of it is outright criticism,” he said.
“But it is not some kind of conspiracy, not a cloak-
and-dagger attempt to wreck the fraternity system.
We (thé Independents) think we are in a position to
make the campus rethink its social responsibility.”

for the full impact to hit yet. I feel

like I’m walking in the clothes of

giants.”

These were the words Randy Phil-
lips used to describe his feelings on
being named a Rhodes Scholar.

Davidson's ninth Rhodes Scholar
since 1950, Phillips received word of
his selection just before Christmas.

Soon after the announcement he
received a letter of congratulations
from Dr. Benjamin R. Lacy, a David-
son Rhodes Scholar in 190$, who had
advice for his younger colleague and
some anecdotes to share about life

at Oxford.

The Rhodes Scholarship will enable
Phillips to pursue a two or three year
course of study in the honors history
program at Oxford University. His
study will lead to a BA degree in
modern European history.

The Rhodes award caps a long list
of honors for Phillips, including aca-
the cross country
team, the presidency of Sigma Phi
Epsilon fraternity, membership in the
Student Life Committee and Omicron
leadership fraternity.
Phillips also serves as the head of

demic honors,

Four Davidson men applied for
Rhodes Scholarships: Wayne Huckel,

after interviews described by Phillips
as “suprisingly low-key, considering
the circumstances.”

After completing his studies at
Oxford, Phillips plans to finish his
military obligations and work toward
a PhD at an American university.

Communications Improved

By DANNY WHITE
Staff Writer

“TI would say that the Sen.
ate’s greatest accomplish.
ment this year has been in
the area of communications.
A new relationship has been
developed between the stu-
dents and trustees through
the work of the Senate and
there has also been an open-
ing-up of the Senate's work
to make it relevant to stu.
dent opinion.”

Speaking is C. L. Cheshire,
junior class senator, in eval-
uating the work of the SGA
Senate since April.

“The senators have been
interested in working and
participating in the Senate's
activities. There wasn't a

great wealth of creative
ideas among the senators but
much of the Senate's work
goes unnoticed.

“I put most of my time in
this acting as an errand
boy. Most of these services
such as running elections,
entertaining the trustees, im-
plementing the new constitu-
tion, making committee ap-
pointments and circulating
questionnaires aren't noticed
by the students but are an
important part of the Sen.
ate’s duties.”

Cheshire indicated that he
did not plan to seek re-elec-
tion to the new Senate at this
time. ‘My understanding of
the nature of the Senate has
changed since I was elected.

Representing Mrs. Norket
al the hearing was attorney
J. Melville Broughton Jr.,
-well known North Carolinian
who was defeated by Bob
Scott for the Democratic gu-
bernatorial nomination last
May

He presented the ABC
board with about a dozen let
ters of recommendation and
character reference from lo
cal citizens on behalf of Mrs.
Norket.

The Davidson Town Coun.
cil, which opposed Mrs. Nor
ket's application both formal

ly and informally, apparent-

ly did not send a representa
tive to the hearing. which
was held in Raleigh.

Last fall the council passed
a resolution opposing the
sale of alcoholic beverages
in Davidson, and Mayor F.
L. Jackson offered to reim
burse Mrs. Norket for her
zpplication fee if she would
withdraw her application, ac-
cording to Mrs. Norket.

Mrs. Norket’s initial appli
cation was turned down by
the state board early last
month. However, state law
allows the applicant 30 days
within which to appeal the
decision.

Two years ago another
North Mecklenburg grocer—
Cashion's in Cornelius—was
initially denied a beer and
wine permit by the state
board.

However, when Cashion's
appealed the decision shortly
thereafter, the board granted
the permit.
