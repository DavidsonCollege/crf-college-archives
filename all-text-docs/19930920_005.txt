P.E. 101 teaches good health and safety lecaisicc aaa
WIRE

By Wendy Lee

Freshmen are undergoing a
six week program, instituted last
year, called Physical Education
101. Weekly sessions focusing on
a variety of health and related is-
sues are required by every fresh-
man.

The classes cover first aid,
adult and infant-child’CPR, sexu-
ality, andalcoholism. Students are
also informed about career plan-
ning, student health, and counsel-
ing services offered by Davidson.
The classes not only inform stu-
dents about important health con-
cerns but also orient them to many

of the services offered to students.

Ron Morrow, director of
physical education, said the pro-
gram began to a large extent be-
cause of the high demand for first
aid classes.

A collaborative effort to add
other topics grew out of this de-
mand, involving the Dean of Stu-
dents Office, the Athletic Depart-
ment, the Student Health Center,
and the Career Services Center .
Morrow also added'that Davidson
can become a better community if
more people are trained in CPR.

Freshman Laura Seib said that
the tour of the counseling center

was of great benefit because with-
out it, she would have been un-
aware of the counseling services
offered to students. However, she
noted schedule conflicts as a prob-
lem: “The class conflicts with other
activities like flickerball games.”
Georgia Ringle, Davidson
health educator who gives the pre-
sentation on human sexuality,
noted that it is important to “get the
students to think ahead and be re-
sponsible for themselves.”
Morrow noted that while the
program is now limited to fresh-.
men, it may be opened to upper-
classmen if demand is sufficient.

Programs include trips to the 3rd world

including an independent study,
counting towards her Davidson
biology major. Incorporated into
the courses was scuba diving three
times per week.

This program housed only
thirty students, two of whom were
alse Davidson juniors, Rod Carter
and Bill Webb, along with three
professors. The living conditions
were “rugged” and with no where
else to visit on the island, Heather
called it “a unique bonding experi-
ence.”

Sam Knowles and Jimmy
Stuart also experienced “bonding”
as they lived and traveled together
in Spain for the year. Deciding to
take an entire year abroad; Sam
chose Spain after visiting the coun-
try in high school. Instead of liv-
ing in one city for the year, Sam
and Jimmy lived with a family in
Seville during the fall semester
and then lived independently in
Salamanca during the spring.

The World Expo wasin Seville
- at the same time Sam and Jimmy

lived in Seville. Visiting it, Sam
recalled bungee jumping off the
New Zealand exhibit. The pair was
able to visit most of Spain during
their year. ;

Sam and Jimmy also toured
Europe during a seven week break
between programs. While their
Salamanca school involved a
month long orientation, the two
were excused because of their ear-
lier Seville experience. The tim-
ing was perfect totravel, Samcom-
mented.

The Salamanca semester of-
fered different characteristics than
the Seville portion. In the spring,
Sam and Jimmy lived alone and
enjoyed their freedom. The courses
they took were serious, Sam stated,
yet the program coordinators real-
ized the importance of cultural
experiences as well.

One such instance Sam re-
membered involved discrimina-
tion. On several occasions, not
just in Spain he recalled not being
served or allowed in bars or restau-
rants because he was an American.
New sentiments like discrimina-

“If you have built castles in the air,

your work need not be lost.

That is where they should be.

Now put the foundations under them.”

tion abroad.

Other students interested in
creating their own study abroad
programs have a unique source of
funding in the Dean Rusk Center.
Herea faculty advisory committee
selects abroad applicants to whom
they disperse the “rather unusual”
program fund, according to direc-
tor Jack Perry.

In the past several years ap-
proximately $30,000 has been
awarded to students interested in
studying abroad in the summers
and sometimes during the year.
While they never awarda full schol-
arship, the funds allotted are based
on the students estimated coverage
and costs.

“Giving preference to unique,

independent academic programs,
the Dean Rusk fund encourages
students specify their interests.
Students participating in the
Davidson-in-Cambridge summer
trip or Davidson’s summer semes-
ter in Mexico have also received
funding from Dean Rusk in the
past.

In addition to the general fund
which is based upon private dona-
tions, a separate Third World Medi-
cal Internship fund exists. The
classes of 1984 and 1986 both do-
nated theirclass giftsto Dean Rusk
scholarship. Private donations
comprise the core of funding for
scholarship based programs.

Students support speech code
STANFORD, Calif. (CPS) - Just
over half of Stanford University
seniors questioned ina recent poll
said they support the university’s
policy on free expression, and 80
percent said they do not feel that it
hindered bringing up sensitive
subjects in the classroom.

Stanford adopted a policy en-
titled “Fundamental Standard In-
terpretation: Free Expression and
Discriminatory Harassment” af-
ter concern mounted over racist
incidents on campus.

John Marr, who conducted
the survey for his doctoral disser-
tation in educational administra-
tion at Ohio State University,
mailed questionnaires to 1,269
Stanford seniors, or about 75 per-
cent of the 1993 graduating olass.

“Although some respondents
reported that they believe that the
policy has contributed to some
degree of self-censorship among
students, many others reported
positive benefits as a result of the
policy,” Marr said.

The 555 respondents re-
flected the racial composition of
the class, he reported.

Flood survivors will feel stress

CARBONDALE, III. (CPS) - A
college psychologist predicts that
Midwest flood victims will have a
tough readjustment when the glare

;

gist from Southern Illinois Uni-
versity at Carbondale. “But after-
ward, when there’s nothing to be
done anymore, you start seeing
physiological symptoms—heart
palpitations, dizziness, and so
forth.”

Snyder heads SIUC’s “Go-
Out Team,” a group of psychol-
ogy students who experience what
disaster victims are going through
by becoming a part of it.

Snyder suggested that flood
victims express their feelings and
not lose their connections that
come from family, friends, and
churches.

Service with a smile

AUSTIN, Texas (CPS) - Texans
apparently have a different style
of helping new and returning stu-
dents move into their dorms—at
least at the University of Texas at
Austin.

President Robert Berdahl and
about 300 other faculty and staff
members participated in the
“Mooov In” event in late August,
Officials said.

The volunteers were stationed
at four residence sites. As stu-
dents and their parents drove upto
move in, the volunteers assisted
by carrying boxes, luggage, ste-
reos, and other items into dorm
rooms. :

A campus news release said

of the media dims, support
dwindles, and relief money and
goods stop flowing in.
“Emotional stress comes as
part of being involved inan event,”
said John F. Snyder, a psycholo-

the first-ever event was designed
to give students an informal
“Texas style” howdy.

The “Mooov In” was named
so because of the University of
Texas’ mascot, the Longhorns.

Davidson students to Rome, study-
ing art and architecture there, as
well as throughout Italy. Last
Spring, professor Shaw Smith led
asimilar trip to Paris. Next Spring,
for the first time, Davidson stu-
dents will travel to London, led by
professor Larry Ligo. According
to Dr. Ligo, the group will spend
about half of their time in London,
and the other half traveling in En-
gland, as well as spending three
weeks in Paris.

Davidson’s Art History pro-
grams in Europe began in 1976,
and, according to Ligo, are very
unique to offer this type of on-site
study to their students.

Finally, Davidson offers an
annual summer program of study
in Cambridge, England.

Davidson’s wide variety of
study abroad options contains
something for nearly every stu-
dent.

More information on each of
these programs can be obtained
from their sponsoring departments,
as well as from the Study Abroad
Office.
