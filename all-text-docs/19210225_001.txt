FOR A BETTER DAVIDSON

Vol. VIII.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON. N. C.. FEBRUARY 25. 1921.

CINDER TRACK RAPIDLY
' BEING PUT IN SHAPE

The track is now being put into shape
so that our men can really get down to
practice. Ditching, leveling, rolling, etc.,
are rapidly getting the oval into good
shape, although this is not yet finished.
The 100 yard straightaway has been
leveled and covered with cinders and
will be in excellent shape as soon as it
gcts packed a little more. The new
cinder take-off for the jumps and the
pole vault is in perfect condition and,
together with the new standards, will
add very much in the development of
our jumpers and vaulters.

Glee Club Enjoys Success-
- fal Trip Thra N. C.

Charlotte, Winston, Lexington, Ashe-
ville tad Hendersonville Consti-
tuted Itinerary for Six-Day
"ied a Deroe
in
Last Lap of Trip

The Glee Club invaded the city of
Charlotte on Monday night, the 14th, for
the purpose of giving a concert at
Queens College, the first jumping off
place on their six day concert tour. The
concert itself was .given in a pleasing
and entertaining way, and followed by
a reception for the club. All agreed
that the college was rightly named for
there were nothing but “queens” pres-
ent. The entire personnel of the club
‘expressed itself as having had a hilar-
iously good time. The delicious refresh-
ments served were greatly enjoyed by
everyone. From what could be observ-
ed, each member of the club had no less
than half a dozen girls to murmur
“sweet nothings” in his ears. Allison
was kept busy handing out pieces of
ribbon from his bouquet—which he re-
ceived following his »olo—to the girls
as mementos.

Tuesday, the songsters journeyed to
the Twin City, arriving in the metropolis
of the state about 3:00 p. m. The trip,
while rather lengthy for some members
of the club, proved uneventful. Refresh-
ments consisting of pies, cakes and
sandwiches were served at Barbers
Junction to all who had the necessary
amount of “filthy lucre” to pay for be-
ing refreshed. After the club had been
comfortably lodged in the Zinzendorf
Hotel; McKeithan and Adams went on
an exploring expedition to Salem Col-
lege to make sure that all the girls knew
about the concert. They reported that
a good crowd would be on hand, for
they fad extended personal invitations
to all. The concert in Memorial Hall of
the college went off in fine shape. A
large and appreciative audience was
present and the boys did their best to
entertain them every minute of the
time. .

The reception given the club following
the concert, by the Junior and Senior
classes of the college was an enjoyable
affair. Refreshments consisting of deli-
cious punch and cakes were served by
the girls. After having spent an enjoy-
able hour in the midst of this large
group of pretty girls the boys adjourned
to their rooms in the hotel to meditate
and dream of the queen each had met.
Gibson expressed the feelings of the en-
tire troup when he remarked “I took
my,heart to Salem, but I left it there.”

Wednesday about noon the club turn-
ed its back on tthe city of Nicotinana
Tobaccum and proceeded southward in
the direction of Lexington. Fred Thomp-

Wild Kittens Claw Twin/Eleven Seniors Speak in|Preliminaries for Inter-

City Flying Squadron

Maure and MacDonald Do Best Work |Four Men Selected to Contend for

for Scrubs—Davis Plays Good
Game for High School Lads

”

Coach Hengeveld and his “papa cats
returned Saturday in time to see the
Wildkittens completely rout the “Black
and Gold Flying Squadron” from Win-
ston-Salem Hi. The game was a rough,
hard-fought encounter, but at times the
teams put out some real playing and
then things got lively. At times the
balt rolled around the floor with no one
apparently able to pick it up. Several of
the players also spent much time on the
floor. Mauze and Scheidt especially
seemed to like the reclining position.

The “Twins” drew first blood when
Davis caged a foul. But this merely
tore a little fur out of the Kitten's coat
and did no real damage. But it put the
fight into the Kittens and two field goals’
by Mauze followed by two by McCon-
nell and one by McDonald, put our
young hopefuls far in the lead. The
rest of the half was about even and the
Kittens lead 13-7 at the half-way sta-
tion.

The second half opened with a rush,
and for a time it looked as tho “the lads
from the tobacco city” would tie the
score. For some time the Red and
Black led by a scant 4 point margin. But
when Mauze rang up four in rapid suc-
cession and McConnell added another
our untamed Kittens were safely in the
lead again. Mauze seemed to weary in
well-doing at this point and one more
goal was the best he could do. But Jim
and Sam carried on nobly and_ the
game ended safely in the Kitten’s
clutches. The Kittens speared 41 of the
squadron's flies, while the the visitors
had to be content with 19 hairs from the
Kitten’s tail.

The “Hi Boys” played a clean, hard
game. Their three fouls stood out in
sharp contrast to the Presbyterians’ 12.
Davis was their star performer, collect-

Oratorical Contest

Medal at Commencement

Efeven Seniors burst forth into oratory
of varying intensity last Tuesday night
in Shearer Halt. As each speaker sat
down it seemed as if he, assuredly had
the Oratorical Medal already won. But.
the final decision of the judges was that
D. R. Freeman and S. M. Query should
represent the Philanthropic Society in
the finals; J. C. McCaskill and A. P.
Ormand the Eumenean. A. F. Fricker
was chosen as the alternate.

Freeman presened the subject of
“Ideals ‘in five pictures,” consisting of
the merry child; the youthful lover; the
careworn business man; and the wither-
ed old man at the end of a mis-spent
life. His fifth picture was the grand old
man at the end of a well spent life in
whom survives the child and the lover.
Tr conclusion he made an appeal for
those ideals that keep alive youth and
love thruout the years. ‘

Ormand spoke on “The Soul of the
Union,” the Constitution, and this can
never be set aside with safety to the
Union. He showed that ours is the first
successful attempt at representative, re-
publican government and that we de-
stroy the very soul of that government
by setting aside the Constitution.

“The Test of the Labor Unions” was
presented by Query, and considered in
the light of their benefit to labor and
their effect upon the nation. He showed
how they had actually benefitted labor,
but he doubted whether or not the good
done to labor balanced with thé hind-
rance they have been to progress in
critical times.

McCaskill! declared that saving the
world was not such an impossible task
if we would socialize education in re-
construction. Such a system must in-
clude training in principles of citizen-
ship. But only through such a system
can the world be saved from the forces

collegiate Debates
Held in Both
Societies
Ambitious Orators Contend for Places

in Contests to be Held With
Wake Forest and Mercer

Eu Society.

The contestants for places on David-
son's inter-collegiate debating teams

met Friday night in the Eu Hall, in a}:

well-prepared and hotly argued prelim-
inary. Those upholding the affirmative
were: A. P. Ormand, P. D. Miller, and
J. M. Richards. The negative team was
composed of W. A. Gamble, A. M. Mit-
chell and R. Bitzer. The subject was
the same which will be used in the
Wake Forest debate, Resolved: that the
United States should cancel her war
loans to the Allies.

The basis of the argument on the
affirmative was the inequality of the
urdens of the present war, which was
ours as much as that of the Allies; the
inability of the Allies to regain their
equilibrium in financial and economic
conditions without our help; the need
for a recovering of our former prestige
in Europe; and the economic value both
to the Allies and to the United States.
The negative advanced arguments and
proof showing that the Allies were able
to pay their just debts contracted dur-
ing the war; that what they needed was
not a cancellation of their debts, but
credit to purchase raw materials for
their industries.

The judges chose W. A. Gamble, P. D.
Miller, A. P. Ormand and J. M. Richards
as principals, and R. Bitzer as alternate.

These men will debate on March t1th
in the finals, together with men chosen
from the Phi Society. From these
“rep” men will be chosen the two teams
to meet Wake Forest and Mercer in

pril.

Row to Carolina
Colleges
N.C. State Noses Out Victory by One

Point Margin—Team Fights Hard
Against Elon and Carolina

Davidson vs. Elon.

In the first game of the North Caro-
lina trip the Wildcats went down in de-
feat before the sturdy Elonites, by the
score of 30 to 19. The game was hard-
fought from start to finish and in the
second half the Wildcats staged a
spectacular come-back and led ‘their
opponents in the scoring, but the lead
the boys from Elon had obtained in the
fist half was not to be overcome. The
close guarding of Elon was the feature
of the first half. They did not allow
the “Red and Black Machine” to score
from the field during that period.

The Wildcats were handicapped by
the peculiarities of the court and by the
conduct of the rooters on the side lines.

‘[In the second half the Presbyterians

came back with vengeance and ran their
opponents off their feet, but strove in
vain to overcome the lead of 12 points
the other team had gained.

Roberts was the chief point collector
for the Presbyterian aggregation scor-
ing 1§ out of the 19 points. Romefelt
played a nice game at center and John
Schenck was the center of the offensive.
For Elon Johnson was the stellar light.
He played a hard fast game and caged a
good many long shots. Fix also did good
work.

Davidson vs. N. C. State.

N. C. State reaped revenge on David-
son last Thursday night at the Raleigh
Auditorium, overcoming a 45 to 13 de-
feat suffered on Davidson's floor last
month, by winning a 29 to 28 victory, on
their home court.

The Wildcats led off with speed and
clean team work, which promised them
a victory over the State five, ending the
first half of the game with a score of
