FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1956

Gift Fund Should Catch Imagination

Events of the past few weeks in Po-
land, Hungary, and the Middle East have
stirred this student body to interest and
concern in international affairs unparal-
leled since the end of World War II.

With this in mind, it is probable that
the 1956 Gift Fund project, which was ap-
proved in chapel Tuesday almost without
opposition, will catch the fancy of the
College in such a way as never before.
Personally assisting a refugee Hungarian
family in finding peace and freedom from
fear should individually and collectively
prove to be an extremely beneficial ex-
perience, particularly during this season
of the year.

The promise of immediately tangible
results adds to the appeal. since there is
a good likelihood that the family could be
here before Christmas.

Already there are signs that this year’s
Gift Fund may easily develop into a pro-
ject which will spread beyond the campus
through the entire community, and will
not follow the usual pattern of being
strictly a college proposition. Dr. Staples
is at present organizing a community com-
mittee which will direct and coordinate
the program through the schools, civic or-
ganizations and churches.

It is important that this be a communi-
ty project from the outset, because this
family will in reality be a part of the com-
munity. And we must realize now that
these people will need far more than a job
for the man of the family. a place to live,
and a collection of old clothes. They will
need genuine friendship and understand-

ing. They must be taught how to live with-
out fear of oppression. The challenge is
obvious.

The “Action for Hungary” Ratly set
for Wednesday should give a real impetus
to the project as the actual canvassing
starts Wednesday night. We are fortunate
to have two speakers whose wide range of
experiences will undoubtedly complement
each other.

Aside from the immediate benefit to
the Gift Fund, the rally should serve to
whet student understanding and aware-
ness of the international scene. There is
considerable sentiment here, as on other
campuses across the country, that the
United States and United Nations vir-
tually ignored the dramatically coura-
geous efforts of the Hungarians, especially
the youth of the country, to throw off
the shackles of unbearable oppression.

A Student Committee for a Free Hun-
gary was organized yesterday and will pre-
sent a petition outlining this position at
the rally, to be forwarded to the United
Nations.

Dr. T. Z. Koo speaking in chapel yes-
terday on the Communist pian for
eventual domination of the world brought
soberingly home the realization that Da-
vidson is not so far removed from the
world’s hot spots as we sometimes tend
to think.

Student awareness is not only an asset

in these troubled times. It is a necessity
and a responsibility.

Kadel Sermon A Refreshing Change

With the season of Thanksgiving hav-
ing just passed, we might do well to offer
thanks to the powers that be for their in-
vitation to Dr. William H. Kadel to speak
at Vespers, and for his acceptance of this
invitation and the message he brought
with him the Sunday evening before the
Thanksgiving holidays.

The invitation to Dr. Kadel marked
what we hope is a rejuvenation of the
Vesper program to the end that Vespers
may regain some of the respect and dig-
nity that it has seemingly lost during the
past few years.

There are several reasons why Dr.
Kadel and his message differed in large
measure from those that we are usually,
although certainly not always, fed’in Ves-

‘pers. First of all, Dr. Kadel came to Da-
vidson from Orlando, Florida. The signifi-
cance of this lies in the fact that a minis-
ter was invited to Vespers whom few stu-
dents here had ever had the opportunity
to hear. This stands as a departure from
the recent policy of asking someone from
the Davidson community or from nearby
towns and villages to speak, week after
week.

Secondly, Dr. Kadel almost immedi-
ately captured student attention by ad-
dressing his remarks directly to us, the
students. He emphasized this point by
using the word “fellows” as he talked,
leaving no one in doubt to whom he was
speaking.

Next, Dr. Kadel kept the attention (at
least more so than is customary) of those
present by preaching his sermon rather
than reading it. With expression and en-
thusiasm he said what he felt needed to
be said.

Perhaps most important of all, Dr.
Kadel brought a message that was aimed,
not exclusively but primarily, at the stu-
dent body and the life it leads in today’s
world. Omitting a lengthy chronological
summary of Biblical events, he related

Christian doctrine to the events of today
and to the lives we lead today.

Finally, he exercised a great deal of
discretion by using a difficult yet effec-
tive device—he quit speaking before his
audience quit listening. ;

If in the future more ministers such as
Dr. Kadel are invited to speak at Vespers,
if more ministers are invited with a mes-
sage for today’s world and our student
body, then perhaps writing of letters and
reading of books in Vespers will cease,
and Vespers will again become the op-
portunity for worship that it was meant
to be and should be. A.W.F.B.

Pooey On
The Pentagon

Christmas is really coming.

And it’s heartwarming to see unselfish
folks dedicatedly interested in holding
down all this commercialization of the
Yuletide that we hear so much about.

For example. When Gen. Maxwell D.
Taylor outlawed Christmas card exchange
between workers in the Pentagon this
year because they clogged up the mail
channels in the building, the Christmas
card people set up a howl that rippled
the Potomac.

One of the most fluent flows of right-
eous indignation came from one Edward
Aloysius Murphy of the Cheerio Greeting
Card Company.

Screamed our boy Aloysius: “It will
take a bigger man than Gen. Taylor to
keep Christmas out of Christmas!”

Yessir, it’s really good to see folks
sticking up for the real Christmas Spirit.

Atta boy, Aloysius.

And as for you, Gen. Taylor, fie on
you! Sir.

WEEP NO MORE MY LADY

Mrs. Roosevelt Should Take
Closer Look at New South

By DON MASSEY

Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt is a lady.
It has been said that she has
charm, grace, and a wealth of
personality. Although she is an
outspoken Leftist. this doesn’t al-
ter the fact that she is an outstand-
ing person in the eyes of a mul-
titude of people.

TO SPEAK HERE

On Friday night, December 7.
this great lady will speak to an
audience composed of Davidson-
ians. Was the choice of this speak-
er as an Artist Series guest made
because she is graceful and charm-
ing. or was it made because she
is the wife of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt?

Could this choice have been
made because Mrs. Roosevelt is
an internationally known figure,
or was ‘it made in keeping with
the present college administration's
poliey of grooming a more “liberal
Davidson”. It really makes little
difference because the choice was
probably made with all of the
foregoing observations in mind.

We would be the last to deny
that Mrs. Roosevelt is an intelli-
gent’ and widely versed lady. She
is highly qualified to speak with
authority on a number of subjects,
and does so at every given op-
portunity. She has even written
authoritative articles on how to
rear a family.

VERY OUTSPOKEN

Mrs. Roosevelt has traveled
more. seen more, and_ indeed,
talked more in one year than most
of us ever will in a lifetime. How-
ever, we don’t believe that she
should be deified merely because
she is an outspoken reformer. By
the same token, neither should
she be damned merely for her out-
spokenness.

Even the most casual observer
must realize that Mrs. Roosevelt
doesn’t entertain any loving
thoughts concerning the South.

By CHARLIE ORUMMOND
and JOHN BERNHARDT

Saturday night a few students
still on the campus discovered
that the reception room in West
was on fire. Immediately, they be-
gan fighting it with anything at
hand — several waste baskets and
a hall trash barrel filled with
water.

They could see nothing of the
fire through the smoke, and their
intermittent buckets of water, cast
at random into the smoke or
poured in a thin layer on the
floor, had little chance of effec-
tively halting the flames.

After the fire truck had finally
arrived and put out the fire, one

MRS. ROOSEVELT

Criticism is hard medicine to take.
It is particularly hard to digest
when the object criticized is one’s
own way of life. And if the “way
of life” is falsely generalized, the
pill is intolerably bitter.

COMMENTS ON SOUTH

W. E. Debnam has made several
astute observations in his “Weep
No More, My Lady” which cover
the point in case extremely well.
Debnam states that Mrs, Roosevelt
made the following comment con-
cernifg a visit to the South. “One
can enjoy oneself superficially, but
ohne must shut one’s eyes.”

To all true Southerners, this was
the straw that broke the camel’s
back. It is unnecessary for us to
defend our way of life against
such a seemingly ridiculous state-
ment. We only ask that before Mrs.
Roosevelt weeps so easily over
present conditions in the South
that she take a longer and more
lasting look at the new industrial-
ized South’s progress. Indeed, the
South has come a long way since
1865.

FATHER COMPLEX

In a_ recent interview, Mrs.
Roosevelt said “the voters of the
nation had a ‘father complex’ for
President Eisenhower; they think

fire extinguishers?”

FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
REMOVED BY COLLEGE

Unfortunately some time ago the
college removed all fire fighting
equipment from the dorms be-
eause of indiscriminate student
usage. While this is a sad com-
mentary on student maturity, the
one thousand dollars necessary to
repair West would have purchased
several extinguisher recharges.

If a student had _ suffocated,
would any expense have been too
great?

care of them in any eventuality”.

This is quite possibly true. But,
if our memory serves us correctly,

‘the voters had the same psycholog-

ical ailment when F.D.R. was re-
elected to the Presidency. How-
ever, the Yalta conference and
other similiar incidents soon cured
many of the afflicted. Let us hope
that Ike will take better care of
his children.

STILL HOPE

In another statement, perhaps
more pertinent to Davidsonians,
Mrs. Roosevelt says, “The hope in
the South is thé younger genera-
tion. There I see great changes
brewing but those changes will be
heart breaking to the older genera-
tion.”

Perhaps, Great Lady, if the
South’s younger generation real-
izes the truths of their heritage,
it will be several more genera-
tions before they are sufficently
indoctrinated into your ways of
thinking.

Blood Drive Gives
Life Saving Chance

By BOB MAJORS

Every minute ... every day ...
over eight pints of blood are used
in this country to treat the ill
and injured. These ill and injured
blood users are not strangers to
you as a Davidson student.

They are people like those neigh-
bors of yours who were badly in-
jured in a recent automobile acci-
dent. Among the if! might be your
Dad's boss. who's just undergone
several hours of surgery. for that
hemorrhaging ulcer of his.

These people, and others like
them, will live because of the
whole human blood provided by
the American Red Cross Blood
Program.

TWO MILLION UNITS

The Red Cross Blood Program
provides over 2 million units of
blood yearly to nearly four thou-
sand hospitais in forty states. In
addition to the whole blood sup-
plied, blood fractions of many
types. made from unused blood,
are made available.

Serum albumen, one of the most
important of these fractions, is
now being stockpiled for use as
a blood substitute in case of a
national emergency or a major
disaster. Alt of this blood is col-
lected, tested, stored, and distri-
buted without charge through Red
Cross Blood Centers.

BLOOD MOBILE HERE
You, as a Davidon student, will

have an opportunity to aid this
program on the 3rd and 4th of
December when the Red Cross
Bloodmobile visits this campus.
A single donation will entitle
you to an individual credit card.
This credit card: is the means by
which you and your immediate

family may obtain blood in any co-
operating hospital, without obli-
gation for replacement, for a
period of six months.

FREE ROTC AND PT CUT

In a more tangible way, the do-
nation of one pint on Monday en-
titles you to a free ROTC drill cut
on Tuesday. It also’means that you
get a free cut in P.T.

If your fraternity comes out on
top in the number of pints dona-
ted, you'll pay less for your Mid-
Winters dance ticket and your fra-
ternity will have a plaque to show
for it’s effort in the drive.

Don’t neglect your opportunity
to help make this drive one of
Davidson’s biggest. Fifteen min-
utes of yotr time may mean fif-
teen years of life to someone else.

Eleanor Roosevelt is truly. the
first lady of the world. She stands
high in the hearts of oppressed
people everywhere and in this
country she is revered by minori-
ty groups whose cause she has long
championed.

No other president’s wife has
taken such an active part in na-
tional and inter-national affairs. In

addition, she was a gracious first.

lady for almost thirteen years and
always a comfort and inspiration
to her husband.

Those who would criticize her
children's actions would overlook
the. fact that they are responsible
to themselves after (hey reach ma-

the character and work of the lady
herself.

Regardless of your feelings for
her, you are sure to find her lec-

NO SWEAT, JUST BLOOD

A hero's bound for glory
Who battles thro’ the mud,
But glory’s piled on glory
If he sheds a little blood.

But whether you’re a brute or squirt
I've got a better deal,

Without the sweat, the strain, or hurt
Some glory you may steal.

Roll up your sleeves and grit your teeth
As though about to fight

And then fall down flat on your back
And bleed with all your might.

The girls will rush to hold your hand
And give you things to eat

But best of all you'll wear a brand
That marks you for your feat.

We feel that the YMCA gift
fund project is undoubtedly the
best that could have been chosen.
Certainly from no other could we
see such tangible results.

Regardless of whether we were
to see the results of our gifts, the

-fact remains that it would be our

Christian duty to give — and give
until it hurts. It would be truly
in the spirit of the season if the
Davidson Student body would vol-
untarily give up some important

' planned expenditure and give the

savings to the gift fund.

Would it be showing too
much enthusiasm if we were
to fast through a meal and
give what should have been
spent on that meal to the gift
fund?

Imagine yourself a Hungarian
refugee. Would you not be truly
grateful for any sacrifice which
a Davidson student could make in
order to assure your passage and
comfortable settlement over here?

For a while Davidsonians were
encouragingly enthused about
keeping up with the world situa-
tion. A look at the front page of
your morning newspaper should
be enough to assure you that the
situation is still grave — perhaps
more so than ever. How can we be
so complacent while the world
stands’ not far from the brink of
total annahilation? ,

On the other hand, maybe you
are right: to die sleeping involves
less struggle. Besides, we can
claim that it removes responsibili-
ty for the destruction.

The students on the halls would
be responsible for them, just as
they are for the hall windows, ceil-
ing panels, and floors. In return
it would be the duty of the stu-
dents, if the school installs fire
extinguishers, to act like gentle-
men and good citizens, accepting
them as instruments with a pur-
pose and not as toys to be tam-
pered with.
