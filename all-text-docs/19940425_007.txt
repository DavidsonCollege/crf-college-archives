Ah, my final Davidsonian ar-
ticle. I must admit that coming up
with atopichas been difficult. First,
I will look back upon my love life
here at Davidson. Okay, now that
I’m done with that topic, I’ll start
thinking about more serious stuff,
like why did I begin writing this
column?

In my final article I would like
to say that everything I have ever
written is a lie. Only white Anglo-
Saxon males who are “born again”
and use correct religious terminol-
ogy will get into heaven. Ireally
do think that I am superior to ev-
eryone else, and God only loves
people who look and act just like
me. I also think that Rush

Limbaugh is the wisest and most
articulate voice in America today
and should be appointed President.
Okay, the last sentence no one
would believe, so you probably
realize by now that I am being
facetious.

Seriously, why have I spent
countless hours this semester think-
ing and writing for The Davidso-
nian? Besides my egotistic desire
for compliments, I am simply
troubled by many things which I
see on thiscampus, inourchurches,
in our society, and within each one
of us. This year has been a culmi-
nation of four years of constantly
asking the question “Why?” Why
do Christian churches drive people
away more than they attract them?
Why do people, black or white,
male or female, straight or gay,
Christian or “non-Christian,” treat
each other with little respect and
sensitivity and constantly try to

shove their viewpoints down each
other’s throats?

. Why is the belief in even the
possibility of God considered anti-
intellectual in our society and in
ourclassrooms, especially ata Pres-
byterian affiliated school? Why
does each one of us feel so empty,
alone, and homesick whenever we
actually take the time to listen to
our lives? Why do we all suffer?

I don’t know the answers to
these questions, and to claim that I
know the answers would be pretty
damn presumptuous. Taking into
account the numerous criticisms
of religion, arguments against the
existence of God, and personal
ways in which I constantly fall
short of my own ethical ideals, I
still feel that if we simply slow
down and listen to our lives, maybe
we can catch a brief glimpse of
something higher and filled with
hope. Whenever I slow down and
simply listen to my life, Ican some-
times catch'a glimpse of the rev-
elation of God through Christ, who
topples every social convention,
pride, injustice, hypocrisy, and re-
ligiosity with the magic of divine
love. Shhh! Listen!

Ladies and gentlemen, what you see before you is
the last piece I will ever write for The Davidsonian.
I’msure more than a few of you are heaving a huge
sigh of relief, but don’t fool yourself. There are
still a few people on campus who can write about beer and sex just

Tithes One exit south of
Davidson sure have-changed.
Though most freshmen probably
don’t know the old Cornelius, se-
niors have noticed a remarkable
number of business chains locat-
ing themselves around the high-
way. When we were freshmen, we
often patronized small businesses
because the big businesses hadn’t
invaded yet.

I decided to write this article
after going to the all-new, spank-
ing clean, moder-looking, neon
and white, 31 flavors plus other
goodies Baskin & Robbins Ice
Cream Store with a couple of
friends. While observing the
hordes of other Davidson students
who were also enjoying a cold
treat, I couldn’t help but reflect on
aconversation! had with the owner
of the Flavors frozen yogurt store
(behind Wendy's) during the win-

ter. Though he seemed optimistic
that spring weather would bring
back the customers, I could tell the
cold months had been a strain on
his small business. He even placed
a T.V. behind the counter for the
long and lonely hours.

When I think about his situa-
tion, I feel a strange pang of com-
radeship and a feeling of loss.
Whenever I talk with people who
own small businesses and are strug-
gling to survive against almost in-
surmountable competition, I usu-
ally want to rally behind them.

Gone are Mom and Pop gro-
cery stores; gone are the home-
town restaurants; gone are many
fruit and vegetable stores; gone are
many small clothing stores. Many
Americans wouldn’t complain at
what has filled the gap—(1) huge,

Why I write: a defense of my future

The great short story writer
Flannery O’ Connoronce explained
that she wrote because she was
good at it, and because she could.
This makes a great deal of sense,
but this does not apply to me.

Ironically, since I started this
column! wona writing award. But
there are many contests I have not
won, in which I have not even
placed. My fiction is difficult, and
my poetry is very troublesome.
So, what intrigues me is the ques-
tion of why someone should write
who is bad at it.

This is an awkward article to
write because the subject is par-

tially myself. I’m not interested in
spreading my outlook, sowing
philosophical seeds, This is not an
argument because herein are too
many loose threads, and at this
point in the semester I have grown
tired of arguing. This is nota list of
which topics I pick to write about
and why I think they are important.
If I’ve done my job at all, that
much should be evident. This piece
is more of an answer to the infa-
mous question: what are you go-
ing to do next year?
Writing has an immeasurable

"Hey Frampton, come here.” A naked
person was talking to me.
"Why?” Not fear. Suspicion.
"I want you to try something.”
"What?" Fear.
"You'll see. Just get your scrawny butt over here.”
"I’mcoming.” My will power hadn't quite developed when I was

Over the past year and a half I have
become attached to writing for you guys
every week. Writing this stuff is how I keep
sane, (and it’s a heckuva lot cheaper than
therapy). I’m going to miss it. I feel close
to you all, you being my surrogate shrinks
andall. I’ve bared my innermost secrets and
most embarrassing moments, and you’ve
kept reading.

I have to thank each and every one of
you for sitting down for two minutes every
Monday and appreciating what I do. I also
want to thank everyone who has gone out of
the way to meet me. There is no better
feeling in the world than when a stranger
tells me, “I read you every week.”

I feel as if Ihave some sort of obligation
to impart some of my senior wisdom upon
you lowerclassmen. Read this and be smart.
It may get sappy, so watch out. Here’s
Nathan’s Guide to a Happy (if not very
productive) College Career.

Do at least five things every week that

your parents would be ashamed of you for
doing. Go out every chance you possibly
can. Never, ever take more than one night to
write a paper. Never, ever take more than
one night to study for a test. Don’t read
everything your syllabus tells you to. Do at
least three things that you swore to yourself
that you would never do. Experiment.
Question authority. Think for yourself. See
three porno movies without saying, “Ooh,
gross.” Get in an argument with a professor
once a semester. Go for a week without
bathing. Meet as many people as you possi-
bly can. Don’t be afraid to start hanging out
with a new clique. Use acondom. Make a
complete fool out of yourself once a week.
Show your hangover that you won’t be
beaten. Make road trips as often as possible.
Never go to the movies on a weekend night.
Vote Democrat. Always finish your beers.
Love yourself. Wet yourself. Don’t tell

a freshman. Still hasn’t, really.

What the naked man wanted me to see,
or, more correctly, to try, was a beer bong.
But he poured the beer into the funnel way
too quickly. Ben had a solution. He rubbed
his finger along the sides of his sweaty nose.
(Ben had his clothes on.) Then he swirled
the greased finger in the beer. Wahla. Some
sort of chemical reaction.

Then I got down on my knees. It was
sort of a preparation for my actions later in
the bathroom on 2nd West. Wells held the
funnel up for me while Harrison and Ben
just watched. I put my thumb over the tube
and put it in my mouth. Then with a rush, I
pulled away my thumb and learned that
physics has a lot more to do with drinking
beer quickly than I had ever imagined.

Flash forward to senior year.

Weare in Harrison's apartment, the one
I would have lived in if I weren't quite such
a student of physics. We are drinking again.

The funnels are gone. (As are the
impromptus, the punch, the nakedness,
mostly, and so forth.) We are older now, but
we are still together. Close to graduation,
there is a sense of nostalgia among us.
Eventually, we begin to catch a buzz.
And we begin to get rowdy. Someone is
relieving themselves and they are not in the
bathroom. (Are they ever, Malinzak?) A
drinking game has long since deteriorated
into "Cheater Wins." The quarters are all
over the floor. And we are still together.
Yes, we have had our problems, both
among us and outside of us, but we are still
together. On the phone, the girls that always
call us call us. They do so because we are
their friends and they are ours. They won't
come over, but we know that they thought of
us. It's nice to be thought of, and though
