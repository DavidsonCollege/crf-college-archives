Women's soccer looks strong |

By Will Cobb

Davidson's women's soccer
team opened its season with two
victories and a tough, hard fought
loss to Maryland. These two victo-
ries over the College of Charleston
and Charleston Southern helped
the team see what to work on,
recognizing weaknesses and
strengths.

Now that the program is in its
fifth year, team depth has grown
and roles for players off the bench
have also changed. This has added
tothe competitiveness which could
be seen Friday night against the
Maryland Terrapins. Davidson lost
3-0, but they played a very rough,
physical match.

This wasa four goal reduction

from last year’s game and Mary-
land only lost two starters. Al-
though the Cats were unable to
score, they had several excellent
opportunities. The new-found
depth in the team could be seen as
the Cats hung tough from the be-
ginning to the end.

With the loss of only two start-
ers, the team still has the offensive
power it had last year. The coach
plans to use a rotating line-up to
exploit the team’s depth, by ex-
changing halfbacks and serving
balls through to the two forwards,
Jenn Beebe and Heather Wineburg.
The schedule features tough com-
petition at home versus teams such
as Duke, NCState, Vanderbilt, and
Kentucky.

Soccer excitement builds on TV

Package continued from page 14

broadcast of the semifinals wasn’t

enough of a product to sell to na-

tional sponsors,” Millen said.
The biggest complication to

creating an attractive package was

that CBS held broadcast rights to
the final match. CBS intended,
just as they did with last year’s
match, not to broadcast the finals
live, but to delay broadcast for a
month. Millen explained, “Nei-
ther CBS nor the NCAA wanted to
discuss that situation because the
soccer rights were just a small part
of their overall billion-dollar con-
tract, most of which concerns bas-
ketball games.

"I’m fully convinced Terry
Holland is the only man inthe U.S.
who could have broken that dead-
lock, and he did. He sat down with
representatives from both andcon-
vinced CBS they didn’t want the
finals because it was a money loser
for them, and he convinced the
NCAA that the finals needed to be
broadcast live. We reached an
agreement over the July 4 holiday
for the NCAA to sell us the rights
to the finals for one year, with a
one-year option.”

With live broadcasts of both
the semifinals and the finals now
in Davidson’s control, the market-
ing possibilities of the package
were looking brighter. But
Davidson wanted to add one more
element in a move to try to build
audience excitement toward the
finals weekend.

With help from Ken Neal ’87
of Jefferson Pilot Productions and
Ken Chartier, worldwide soccer
promotions director for Adidas, the
college created “College Soccer
Weekly,” atern segment hour-long
weekly show with a format that
includes highlights of games, rules
discussions, skill clinics and player
interviews. It will be hosted by
Mike Hogwood, debuts on The
Prime Sports Network September
22, and continues until the cham-

“pionships on December 3 and 5.

The Prime Sports Network reaches
over 40 million households na-
tionwide, so the potential audience
for the shows is tremendous. Millen
said that since Davidson is one of
the top soccer programs in the coun-
try, some of its games will surely
be included in the highlights seg-
ments. He also hopes that
Davidson’s soccer coach, Charlie
Slagle, will become a regular pre-
senter on the show.

Because of the strength of the
ACC soccer market, some of the
ACC championship games were
added to the package.

The entire package was sold
to Soccer USA Partners, a New
York marketing firm, which is lin-
ing up sponsors for all the broad-
cast elements. The NCAA is guar-
anteed $100,00 for the deal, and
Davidson will earn a small share.

Millen said, "With the pack-
age we hope to develop such a
significant TV audience that the
championships will never leave
us."
