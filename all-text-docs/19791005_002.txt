The ‘protest at enna was
only one. of several similar
protests against nuclear power
last weekend all over the coun-

try. Sophomore Tim. Dwight,
ae of the students attending
the demonstrations, said the
weekend protest was the culmi-
nation of six months of planned
demonstrations.

Marynowski ‘described the
series of events over the wéek-
end as relaxed, calm,’and very
orderly. The students camped
at the base for the protest, a

_ rented lot about five miles west
of Barnwell.

On Monday, special groups
trained in non-violent protests
climbed over the fences sur-.
rounding all three nuclear power
installations. There, they wai-
ted to be arrested.

The fair Saturday had anti-
nuclear exhibits, and displays
of alternative energy sources.
Along with the colorful tents for
the exhibits, there was a big-top
tent for rallies and speakers.

Review Board letter delayed

By MARK BARRETT
News Editor
The Review Board has yet to
submit its promised letter ex-
plaining the reasons behind its
ruling in a recent controversial
Honor Code violation.

Last Spring,the board chang-
ed a prominent student ath-
lete’s suspension from school
from fall to winter term. The
decision allowed the athlete to
participate in his sport this fall.

Board Chairman Merlyn
Schuh said September 19 that
the. letter would be ready last
week. He said that his busy
schedule and the delicacy of the
matter delayed the letter’s pub-
lication.

Schuh,a chemistry profes

sor,said that he completed a
would—be final draft Wednes-
day ,but that other Board mem-
bers asked for revisions. Schuh
would not predict when the
letter would finally be released.

“We want to do it right and
be sure that it’s legally respon-
sible, Schuh said. He added,
‘it’s very difficult for us to
know what we can write (due to
the secrecy provisions of the
Honor Code),and what we can
write constructively.”

Schuh said that the letter will
attempt to give the Review
Board’s reasons for its decision
to postpone the sentence. He
stressed that the letter will not
contain the specifics of the
case,including the athlete’s
name.
