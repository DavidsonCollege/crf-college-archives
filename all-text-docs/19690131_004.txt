“Tr think ROTC is a good
program -too miany people
knock it’

Thus freshman Howard
Ramagli explained his at-
tempt to organize a Persh-
ing Rifle drill team at Da.
vidson.

“I guest you could call this
my own crusade to improve
the ROTC program here at
Davidson."” said Ramagli.
“A drill team would not only
add to the prestige of ROTC
heré. it would definitely be
an asset to the entire col-
lege community.”

Ramagli explained that
those.in the Pershing would
be chasen from:those in the
junior class on down. per-
ferably those who Have had
experience with close order
drill,

“Tf only 16 people showed
interest in this program the
ROTC Department would
back us with rifles and other
equipment.”” said Ramagili.

“Maj. (Frederick C:) Brig
ham said he would serve as
staff adviser. This is if Col.
(Frederick, B.) Outlaw allows
me to organize the pro
gram."

"Since. most people here at
the college aré opposed to

help us out,’ he said, “but
all of them indicate that
qualified black students
rather. attend local black
colleges or northern
“schools.”

Henschen noted that ex.
cept for the recruiting ef-
forts of Calvin Murphy and
Larry Slade in Charlotte.
very little success was had
in the recruiting of qualifi-
ed black students.

Recruiting efforts in the
North had met with excel-

Ramagii.

“A lot of the financial bur-
den of uniforms and trans-
portation to parades and
drill meets would have to be
carried by the members of
the drill team.”

“The group would march
at half-time of football
‘games. parades. and drill
meets with other colleges,”
Ramagli said. “The drill
team could decide itself
what kind of maneuvers it
would preform.”

known in many parts of the
North, many students are
familiar with our basketball
record and are anxious to
learn more about us. The re
sponse in the North is very
encouraging,’ he said.
According to Henschen.
the principal benefit of the
recruiting program has been
that it improved the school's
relations with guidance coun.
selors. ‘Guidance counselors
are extremely important to
any recruiting effort.” he
said. “By keeping them in-
terested in us, we can have
an inside track on good pro
spects for years to come.”

Naval Unit
Provides

Alternative

By JULE YOUNG
Staff Writer

Several Davidson students
are presently participating
ih a little known program
known by the Navy as The
Reserve Officer Candidate
School.

According to Nelson Abell.
a Davidson junior involved
in the program, ‘The pro.
gram will insure that I can
join the Navy: yet, it will
save me the problem of. wait-
ing to get in Officer Candi‘
date School and therefore be
susceptible to the draft.” The
program {s organized under-
the direction of the Char
lotte Naval Reserve Unit.

No training is required in
the ROTC program during
the college year, although
the members of the program
are encouraged to drill for
the equivalent of three hours
each week with the Naval.
Reserve Unit.

“However, each partici-
pant is required to attend a
summer session at Newport.
R. I. both before and
after his senior year.*. Abell
said. The result is that éach
Participant receives a com.
mission as an ensign, be.
ginning a three-year tour of
active duty.

Abell noted that ROTC
students should. begin pro-
cessing applications for the
program during the latter
part of their sophomore
year. ‘“‘Members of advanc.
ed ROTC are ineligible,’ he
said.

Other Davidson students
presently involved in the pro-
gram are Keith Sykes and
Gary Hemric. John Giles re.
ceived a commission under
the program last year.

GARY HENSCHEN
. stiff competition

He said that the program's
next phase would involve re-
cruiting high school juniors
in the spring.

When asked about the re.
cent proposal that a pro.
fessional recruiter be hired,
-Henschen said he was
strongly in favor of such a
step.

“It would te a tremendous
boost to the recruiting ef-
fort.” he said. ‘Students
simply do not have enough
free time to do a topflight
job and our admissions of-
ficals spend all their time
in reviewing applications
and dealing With alumni.

“All the top Northern
schools have professional re
cruiters, but they have ade-

North

quate funds to finance them.
A professional _—recruiter
would have to receiv a
salary eguivient to our other
administrators, but. if we
could afford one, it would be
well worth the price.”

He added that recruting
by students was worthwhile
and should ‘be’ continued in
any event. .

He added that recruiting
by students was worthwhile
and should be continued in
any event. Henschen noted
that even where the recruit-
ing itself was not successful
guidance counselors were
glad to have their students
exposed to a college student
discussing college admis-
sions.

“Even though we haven't
done as well as we would
have liked.“’ Henschen said,
“we have made a respect-
able start.”’

SAY

A brief discussion of how
formal studies leave little
time for anything else was
suspended when the topic
turned to fraternities. Eight
Independents were on hand
to express their views.

No fraternity members at

meeting was announced at
lunch in the Student Union.
Todd Hobbie.
who said that he had turned
down bids after rush _ this
year, claimed that fraterni-
ties monopolize social, life."
“I think the system puts stu-
dents in an unfair position.’’
he said. ‘We have to choose
between no social life and
embracing an_ exclusivist
system.

“I think there should be a
social system that encom-
passes the entire student
body. The administration
should take the initiative
and produce change."

Berkley Lattimer pointed
to fraternities as a failure
of the structure of Davidson.
“The college has turned over
facilities to dn admittedly
discriminatory system. The
system dehumanizes fra.
ternity men; they allow
themselves to become una-
ware of the problems of the
Independents and the college
as a whole.”

“Independents feel a little
bitter because we've had the
short end of the deal." add-
ed John Reisner. ‘‘When the
fraternities tell you to go to
hell, then what can you do

around here, especially if
you don't have a car?"

The committee asked for
suggestions on future policy.
Committee member Bayard
Miller said, “I don't think
that we have to work under
any assumptions, either that
the fraternities will go or
that they'll stay. All possi.
bilities should be explored."

Newly elected SGA Vice.
President Tom Opie suggest-
ed that system based on
dormitories, like. the system
at Wake Forest, would be
ideal. “The Residence Hall
Association should handle
the problem."’ he-said. ‘The
RHA’S major role is to over.
come frag-zentation.

“IT would like to see. the
dorms as the basic social
unit. Of course. major reno.
vations, lounges and other
over all improvements
would have to be made.”

Opie and Hobbie agreed
that the present fraternity
buildings could be used for
eating clubs.

Chairman C. Shaw Smith
closed the meeting by say-
ing that fraternities will be
a large. but not the only,
part of his committee's
work.

Four more open commit-
tee meetings are scheduled
for weekends before May:
Feb. 7-8, Feb. 28 - March 1,
March 28-29 and April 11-12
