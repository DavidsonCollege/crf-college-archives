Poole Shares SC Honors .

An amazing ovent transpired right under the neces.
of the moguls of the wide world of ihe Sputhern Coen-
ference when s Davidson football player was chosen the
coreciplent of the conference player of the year award
by the sportswriters this week,

Mot that Jimmy Poole, who had an all-but-unbeliev-
able year in air combat, is not deserving of recognition.
He may be more so—thal is not the point But so litle
ennsideration has been afforded tn the elite of the Wilde
ests within recent memory that in a way it had seemed
that the conference had been alloting votes in direct pro-
portion to enrollment.

Poole began the August trial-by-sweat this season nat
even certain of the number-one quarterback slat. Jake
Jacobsen's bout with mononucleosis presented Poote an
uncontested shot to try to fill the fal) with the ball. and
he rose to the challenge so well that by mid-season he

Contrary ta what has been written elsewhere, Podlu

lwy and Dave Sprinkle broke the barrier last year. But
Poote ranks tilgh In Davidsan’s new breed of athletic
prowead. Ani he is the first Wildeat pig-lugger to break
the bank.

Poole sald that he felt grateful both to the team and
to his coaches for giving him both the confidence and the
support he needed along the road to success, Southern
Conference style. “Teamwork was the Key all season,”
sald Poole, “and I was just lucky to be receiving all the

ep."

Hamor agreed that Poole certainly deserved the hon-
ar and remarked that the 1,925 yards that he racked up
would never bave been possible “if Jimmy hadn’t been
just the right type of leader for our situation.” With
Poole leading the offensive barrage, the ‘Cats always felt
ihat they could score again.

Poole‘s offansive credentiels sound like those of the

“it's wonderful,” said Tomey, “that athletics allows
a boy to work as hard as Jimmy did and come that far.
Just looking af where he was two vears ago and where
he is now is a miraculous thing. It's a tribute to his will-
ingness to stick to it."

And through all this exeltement Poole has main-
tained his humuality. To be able to survive the pronged at-
iacks (in jest, of course) of his fraternity brothers and
