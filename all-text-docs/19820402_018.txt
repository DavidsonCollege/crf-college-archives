Memories of my childhood are vague and _strange/l
remember the big wooded [ot across from us, across from the
grdvel grey road, our dead end street/In the big wooded lot
of ark green pines and brown shaggy needles,

the middle, was a ditch of red clay,

y ay ull of dust and clumps of dirt

And I remember my brother throwing these clumps at me,

and I threw some back, and we both laughed though I never

Th dirt clods. would spray dust when they hit someone

And the gravel grey road was dusty, too, particularly in the

unrelenting winds of summer

The gravel was hotter and harder

Hotter and harder than the dirt clods

With fine shiny specs I remember holding a sharp piece of

gravel and I remember thinking how pretty and full of bright

S gravel Sat in the gravelly dusty road and the”

blistering breeze would kick up a dust.devil

Like a baby twister striving for greatness whirling harder
and harder and then just evaporating

Disappearing

Leaving a few pine needles moved and rearranging the dust

green and wet, "softs cool

Green and wet%Zoft and cool because I liked feeling hot'and

But those damn dust devils I never touched

Iran after them and they were gone -

Or | ran up to them, and then we would face each other,
contemplating

And they would turn away and slip into another world
Shuffling off their clothes of dust and needles and

Naked, I could see them not at all

But I felt their hot breath.

Memories of childhood are vague and strange

I remember the big wooded lot

And the gravel road

And the dust 7

And the heat of my imagination. Mo

“Archbishop Beck of Liverpoool says ‘to turn
the other
Cheek is a counsel of perfection addressed
to individuals

not to governments!” News Item.

Ever since Jesus added, “turn the otha cheek,” to his

strange notions,
The godly and learned men of.every creed and clan

Have said this counsel of perfection does not apply. to

nations,
But was meant only as rule for individual man.

Jesus would think it paradoxical and ironical,

And if consequences were not too horrible to contemplate,
He would say it is most comical,

That this learned interpretation man will soon invalidate.. .

When nuclear bombs are built by every nation,

As soon must be if they are to keep their ‘pride,
Then there will be an eritirely new situation,

And all must turn the other cheek or commit suidice.

On the Verge

Indians move
burros

up and down deserted mountains
Blue-corn tortillas

wrinkle on the fire

like nubile children

in the heat of the day. |

Wind blows hemlock

and mushrooms grow unaided.
Overhead.

hawks circle.

Rats scurry into shacks.

Pigs squeal:

as if caught in the balance

as if on the verge

of something

in

Mexico.
