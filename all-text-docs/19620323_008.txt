Drawings Held To Settle
Annual Fight For Rooms

Davidsonian Feature Writer

“It’s that time of the year again,” sighed Mrs. Moore. “I really hate to see it roll
around. From now on out, it’s nothing but room registration, dance weekend worries,
and more registration for summer school.”

And as she spoke, it. was evi-
dent that Davidson's “Mother”
had her worries. not the least of
which was where to find space
to put eack one of her “chil-
dren” for next year. And. she’ll
get about 250 more with next

aE

year’s incoming freshmen. Chil-
dren. that is. not necessarily
worries, or at least she hopes.
REMOVALS THREATENED
There is one good thing the
frosh have going for them. Mrs.
Moore said that she will put.

NEW PASTOR ARRIVES

Harper Begins Duties

The Rev. Curtis P. Harper,
Jr., began his duties as minister
of the Davidson College Presby-
terian Church this past Monday.
Harper comes to Davidson from
the Chesterbrook Presbyterian
Church in Falls Church, Va.

Harper is an alumnus of Dav-
idson College, having graduated
with the class of 1950. While
here he was a member of the
Phi Delta Theta social fraterni-
ty.

Upon graduation from David-
son, he attended Union Theolo-
gical Seminary in Richmond,
where he received his BD de:
gree in 1953. He then entered
the navy as a chaplain, volun-

teering for service in Korea, but
was sent instead to the Philip-
pines. After completing serv-
ice, Harper was asked to serve
at the Chesterbrook Church. He
has been there since 1956. While
there, he found time to do grad.
uate work and received a ThM
degree from Union in 1958.

Harper received his call from
the church here in January of
this year.

The Harpers are living in the
church home next to the College
Infirmary. Mrs. Harper said
that both of them were anxious
for students to drop in when-
ever they wished. “Curtis and I
both want to meet as many
students as possible,” she said.

them somewhere, even if she
has to move upperclassmen out.
“lt even had to move upperclass-
men out of third floor Watts
this year to make room for the
freshmen. I may even have to
go to the first Moor next year,”
she threatened.

From the traffic in and out
of Mrs. Moore’s office the past
week, it seemed that plenty of
people were worrying about
room space for next year. More
than a few-had been so eager to
keep the same room that they
had this year that they rushed
in and forgot to bring their yel-
low cards from the bursar's of-
fice. Or so they said. But Mrs.
Moore told them, “Nobody gets
a room without a card.”

LADY LUCK

The real worry was for stud-
ents drawing numbers in order
to get a better room for next
year. For the past three days,
lady luck has been busy in one
way or another for each student
who drew the number that told
whether or not he had to climb
an extra flight of stairs next
year. One rising sophomore
looked at his number 175 and}
moaned, “Man, I'm already
panting from those stairs I
know [ll be climbing.”

The drawing began on Tues-
day, and right away one studert
informed his roommate, “We've
got number 40, and there are
20 more people ahead of us.”
And so it has been all week,,
with roommates hopefully sur-
veying their situation and keep-
ing their fingers crossed about
where they could put their pin-
ups next year.

‘

WINKIN’, BLINKIN’ AND NOD are only three of the many
students that have succumbed to the soporific breezes of early
spring. The symptoms of this chronic ailment are heaviness of
the eyelids, inability to hold the head in an upright position and
e failure to concentrate on the gems of wisdom uttered each
day by professors. ‘It appears that this is only the incubation
period of the sickness that strikes the campus each year, causing
those stricken to seek the fresh air of the out-of-doors and the
sunshine provided on the dormitory lawns. (Steff Photo by Me-

Ancient Sloan Collection
Contains Rare Stamps

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

We were stopped on the porch by the upstairs ‘just a minute,” and after about
five of them, the door was Opened by one of Davidson’s legendary characters, Miss

Louise Withers Sloan.

A few stammers brought us
to the parlor where we assured
Miss Sloan that we did not know
how to kindle a fire that quickly
in. the old trash-filled stove.
Wasn't there something about
a stamp to sell?

Miss Sloan returned with
an armful of boxes and an af-
ternoon full of stories, both of
which she began to open to
us.

Miss Sloan produced an an-
cient stamp album, its pages in
French and marred with little
rectangular holes where some
of its stamps had been, and told
how the collection began with
this book. It was sold to her
father by Jules Dufour, from

Sigma Phi Epsilon
Wins District Prize

The Davidson chapter of Sig-
ma Phi Epsilon was awarded the
Outstanding Chapter of the
Year Award for district five by
the two governors of the fifth
district at the Carolina’s Sig Ep
Ball in the Hotel Charlotte last
Saturday night, March 17.

The fifth district contains the
nine SPE chapters in North and
South Carolina. These chapters
competed among themselves for
the award on the basis of first
semester of this year and last
semester of last year.

The award was based on in
ternal chapter operation, such
as the use of committees, rush-
ing, and scholarship, and on par-
ticipation in campus activities
by the individual members of
the fraternity and the fraternity
as a whole.

The winning of this award
now gives the Davidson Sig Ep
chapter a chance for winning a
national outstanding chapter
award.

The Davidson Sig Eps also
won the singing contest at the
ball under the direction of
Doug Heidt.

Switzerland, while he was a
student here in the early
Ninety’s.

So, thankful to M. Dufour, we
now sorted through a sheaf of
old envelopes, patriotic covers
and Civil War stamps. There
were old postmarks of Davidson
College, before the days of the
Davidson, N. C., P. O. There
were some of the earliest stamp-
ed envelopes.

And carefully sealed in plas-
tic jackets were the covers of
the Confederacy. Some were
homemade affairs, and Miss
Sloan unfolded them to show us
the addresses on both sides—to
conserve paper. At last she
passed around, with a mixture
of modesty and triumph, what
was once reputed to be the
“rarest cover in the U.S.” It was
postmarked Camden, Miss., June
24. Opposite the C.S.A. “Rose
Stamp” was a picture of Presi-
dent Lincoln.

The picture showed Abe up-
side down, hanging to be
exact. And it was graced by
such endearments as “Abe
Lincoln the Destroyer—He
once split rails, now he hes
split the union,” and “iIm-
peached and deposed, Tried
and convicted.” ‘Beside Lin-
coln was the terse remark,

SCHOLARSHIP
APPLICATIONS

The Office of Admissions
and Financial Aid announced
this week that scholarship
applications are due by

March 24. This includes re-
newal of ali scholarships and

new applications for those
who would like to be consid-
ered for a Dana Scholarship
or a general scholarship.

If additional information is
desired, students are advised
to come by the Office of Ad-
missions and Financial Aid
in Room 144, Chambers.

“The penalty for disregarding
the constitution.”

In the neat hand of the 19th
century were the confident
bravado of the young South:
“The stars and stripes lie in the
dust, Never to rise.” “The South-
ern star is rising.” “The Stars
and Bars shall for ever wave
triumphant.” The copyright was
claimed by a TM&TC, Box 417,
Nashville, Tenn.

How much was the cover
worth? Miss Sloan effused; one
like it, but without the rose
stamp, a rare bird itself, had
brought $80 at a philatelical
convention.
