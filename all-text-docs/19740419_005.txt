Those who think that Myrtie Beach
and Ocean Drive are the greatest
things ever to happen to the Atlantic
Ocean probably have unrefined tastes
with regards to seafood too. So let's
erase South Carolina from our map
(lots of other people would like to do
that also) and begin with the souther-
nmost tip of North Carolina.

Calabash lends itself to the East
Coast in much the same capacity that
Fisherman's Wharf holds in Califor-
nia. All of the glossier magazineshave
featured the town, and to have ac-
tually been there is always worth a
few ahhh’s in strange company.

In case you don’t know, Calabash is
a small coastal town with no com-
merce other than a pink and magnetta
ice cream parlor and a dozen-odd
seafood restaurants all claiming to be
the original place.

Until a few years ago the town was
known only to the local farmers and
Knapp shoe salesmen. I can remem-
ber fighting the flies that are
inevitably attracted by fresh fish and
reading greasy shirt cardboard signs
such as “restrooms out back”’ and ‘‘no
whiskey drinking”’.

Time marches us ever onward, so
that now on any given summer night
the traffic noise smothers the cricket
concerto, and one is haunted with
memories of Cherokee. The Cherokee-
by-the-Sea image shines clearly in the
variety of Calabash bumper stickers
being sported and through the way in
which folks take pictures in front of
the now-disfunctional shrimp docks.

So much for atmosphere; now for
the food, which is admittedly
delicious. The Calabash cooks have
been in the business of preparing
nothing but seafood for years, and one

However, one meal only may give

is a result of its freshness. Allow me to

Letter To The Editor

To the Editor:

I would like to take ex-
ception to the headline
‘‘Coeducation Results in
Tuition Hike’’ in the April 12
DAVIDSONIAN and all im-
plications to that effect that
might have been in Mr. Cor-
nell’s speech. In careful

reading of the article and
analysis of the needs of the
college none of the expenses
cited, with the possible ex-
ception of gymnasium fac-
ilities, are the direct result of
coeducation.

Instead, these needs are due
to’a 50 percent increase in the
student body, regardless of
whether this increase is
unisex or coeducational.

Coeducation with a constant
student body would not
necessitate additional housing
facilities. Expenses and fund-
raising restrictions associated
with the new library and con-

current dislocation of the
Student Union were com-
mitted before coeducation was

The art department has been

Similarly, the student-

coeducation is forcing David-
son to raise its tuition, I hope
his listeners were awake
enough to recognize the
misrepresentation.
Increases in Davidson's
tuition are the result of an
inopportune increase in the

student body, not
coeducation!

Last weekend I was home
for the traditional academic
holiday of Easter. As part of
my family’s tradition we all

Picking it up, I discovered it
to be dyed red and black. Cat-
chy, eh? After running my
hands all over it for about an
hour, a strange looking Bunny
appeared. He had the gall to
tell me that he would grant me
three wishes for Easter.

So I took him up on it. What
did I have to lose; church
wasn't for an hour or so

My first wish went
something like this: I wish for
the English Comprehensives
to be eradicated

My second wish was: | wish
for a passing grade on m\
English Comprehensives

And my final wish was this
| wish not to sleep through the
English Comprehensives.,
which will be given Saturday.

But before the Bunny could
get the stuff together and
grant me my Easter special,
my sister came along and
scared him away. I cried all
the way to church, and during
part of the sermon.

I guess the reason English
Comprehensives are still ad-
ministered is because David-
son likes to keep its own house.

But it seems that going co-
ed was like doing the old
tablecloth trick with your best
china, and having it flop, and
going to a self-selective social
system was like letting the cat
out and ending up getting
locked out yourself.

If Davidson can afford to
break china and put up with
cats, why can't it make one
more sacrifice: either

wouldn't have to sit next to my
senile aunt during Easter lun-
ch — and I didn’t have to.

my subscription on time (I
usually have to write them a
nasty letter and tell them to

And finally, my sister is

He owns an Audi dealership!
