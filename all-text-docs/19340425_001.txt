Jimmy Halverstadt Wins In
Intercollegiate Tennis Meet

Davidson Team Also a Runner-up in Doubles to Divide Honors
With Duke at State Tournament

Jimmy Halverstadt, Davidson ace,
won the state title in the North Caro-
lina Intercollegiate Tennis Tournament
which took place April 19-21 at Chapel
Hill, All of the Big Five colleges plus
Lenoir-Rhyne entered men in_ this
tournament. There were thirty-eight
men entered, which is the largest
number on record for this annual meet.

The first four seeded players came
through the first round without much
difficulty. Welch, who was‘ seeded
second to Halverstadt, encountered
stiff competition in the person of Mc-
Glinn, but used his cannonball sery-
ice and sizzling drives to win out. Hal-
verstadt turned in the most impressive
performance, giving up only two games
in his first two matches. Lafferty of
Davidson won his first match easily
but was defeated by Harris of Caro-
lina in the second round.

The second day’s play. left North
Carolina with little hope of retaining
either of the titles which Tar Heel
players have monopolized for a long
time. By their concentrated action,

Davidson and Duke succeeded in de-
throning Carolina in both the singles
and doubles events.

Jimmy Johnston, tenth ranking Tar
Heel player, furnished the major up-
set of the tournament when he defeat-
ed two teammates who outranked him,
including Captain Dave Morgan, He
also pushed Higgins to the limit be-
fore the Duke star eked out a vic-
tory.

Davidson and Duke split honors in
the finals with Halverstadt defeating
3arney Welch of Duke for the singles
title, 6-4, 6-2, 6-1, and Welch and Hig-
gins defeating Halverstadt and Laf-
ferty, 5-7, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4, for the doubles
championship. Halverstadt seemed to
reach his peak in the finals and com-
bined his flashy play with brilliant
headwork to display a great all-around
game. Welch furnished plenty of com-
petition, but Halverstadt’s superior
steadiness decided the match. The
point score by sets showed Halverstadt
32, 35, and 29, and Welch 25, 25, and 15.

Bowery Ball Ends
Brilliant Weekend

Archie Davis Plays for Set, of
Colorful Dances

Davidson's annual Bowery Ball, one
of the most delightful social events of
the college year, was held Saturday
night in the-Charlotte-Armory-Audito-
rium and proved to be an unusually
successful and brilliant affair. Two
other dances served as preliminaries to
the ball and these were held in the
Charlotte Hotel.

The social fraternities on the hill in-
vited a large number of guests up for
the week-end, which included a formal
dance Friday night, a free tea dance
Saturday afterngon, and the colorful
Bowery Ball Saturday night.

The Armory-Auditorium was gaily
decorated with various colored stream-
ers and designs. Confetti and paper
serpentines were furnished to all who
wanted them, while balloons were re-
leased from the top of the Armory, to
the delight of all.

The costume prize for girls at the
ball, a compact, went to Miss Mar-
jorie Robinson, of Lowell, who wore
a black hat with ostrich plume at-
tached, black and white dress with
jabot effect at the neck, and white
shoes tied with black ribbons. Ac-
cessories were matched in black and
white also.

The boys’ costume prize, a carton
of cigarettes, went to Jack Williams,
who wore a rakish suit of checkered
brown with peg-top trousers of Bow-
ery style, a pink shirt, a purple tie, and
a big brown derby, all of which was
accentuated bya large red flower in
the lapel of his coat.

Archie Davis and his orchestra, com-
posed of ten men and a torch singer,

Holland Leads ‘D’ Club

Ceremonies in Chapel

The “D” Club, with their president,
Mack Holland, presiding, conducted
the chapel services Tuesday morning.
Holland read the scripture lesson and
then explained to the student body the
purpose and aim of the chapel exer-
cises.

Holland said: “We, the members of
the ‘D’ Club, in keeping with the spirit
of Davidson and her morals and tra-
ditions, feel that it is wise to bring
before the student body the oath and
training regulations to which every
member of the club is obliged to sub-
mit. We feel that, with the co-opera-
tive efforts of the student body and
the influence of the club, Davidson
athletics will be aided by this move-
ment.”

Hugh Hawkins, varsity cheer leader,
offered a prayer.

Holland read the “D” Club oath and
then called the roll, asking that each
pee would signify his intention of
abiding by these rules by coming on
the platform. Wearing their “D”
sweaters, the members took their
places on the platform and rose and

repeated the “D” Club oath.

Two Junior Assistants

Will Aid Cheer Leader

According to Paul Warren, newly-
elected varsity cheer leader, the outlook
for the junior cheer leaders during the
coming year looks very bright, with
eight candidates working for those
positions,

Several men who have reported for
the tryouts look as though’ they have
had previous experience, and those
who are out for the first time are
working industriously, learning the
fundamentals of the job.

Those men making up the list of

candidates for junior cheer leader are: |’

Jake Balsley, “Cokey” Branton, Joe
Dees, Bud Hunter, Carlyle Lewis,
Scotty McLeod, Bud Okey, and Ab
Price.

These men will work out at the few
remaining athletic contests of this
year and at the pep meetings in the
fall. They will also lead cheers at the
first football game in September. This
is done in order that the student body
may judge which two of the men will
make the best assistants for the com-
ing year. .

The election for the junior cheer
leaders will be held after the first foot-
ball game next fall.

Warren is expecting to introduce
some new yells next year, and several
new college songs, on which Professor
Pfohl is now working.

He is also working on plans for tak-
ing a cheering section from Davidson
to the Army game at West Point, and
is trying to get reduced rates for a
special train.

at Davidson that were not what they
should be: “Smooching” and behavior
during devotional exercises. He ended
his talk by formally turning over his
office to Skip Brown.

The incoming president stressed. the
nature of the trust he was assuming
as “a job to be done and not an honor
