STUDY FOR ONE YEAR OR FOR ONE OR TWO TERMS IN

OXFORD

Several colleges of Oxford University have invited the
Washington International Studies Council to recommend qualified
students to study for one year or for one or two terms. Lower Junior
status is required, and graduate study is available. Students are
directly enrolled in their colleges and receive transcripts from their
Oxford college; this is NOT a program conducted by a U.S. College
in Oxford. 3.2 minimum index in major required.

An alternative program which is sponsored by a U.S. University
is available for students with minimum indexes of 2.7. Students
will have social and athletic rights in an Oxford college and the fees
are substantially less.

Many educators believe that the tutorial system of Oxford and
Cambridge (in which one scholar teaches one or two students very
intensively) provides a unique liberal arts education. Evaluations

(written or by telephone) from previous Oxford students from your
college, or in your field, can usually be arranged by WISC.

Government and Journalism courses are taught by senior-level
government officials, who are also scholars, and by
experienced journalists. Similar opportunities in public policy
internships are offered (with academic credit) in London (Fall,

Women's Tennis Aims
For Big South Championship

By Larry Dagenhart

The Davidson women’s tennis
team opened up its 1991 spring
season last Sunday with a9-0 loss
to Vanderbilt University. Despite
the shutout, coach Caroline Price
was very much “encouraged” by
what she saw on the court.

’ A definite example of this was
freshman Cyndi Hess, the number
one seed for Davidson who is also
nationally ranked in the top 100 of
the USTA in her age group.

Hess lost only 6-4, 7-5 to

Vandy’s Michelle Dodds, another ~

freshman who also sports a “high”
national ranking. The loss dropped
the women’s team to 6-1 for the
entire year.

The Commodores basically

outclassed the Wildcats by means
of experience. The entire team
was composed of all juniors and
seniors except for Dodds.
Davidson, on the other hand, has
three freshmen playing in the top
Six.‘ .

Respectively, these are Hess
at number one, Jennifer Beahm at
two and Tasha Ruth at the number
four position. Co-captain Mary
Beth Ruth is the only senior and

plays at number threé singles.

This spring, Davidson plays a
complete schedile of Big South
Opponents... Other highlighted
matches down the road include
North Carolina, N.C. State; Fur-
man, and always-tough UNCC.

Over Spring Break, the team will .

travel to Hilton Head, SC to take -
on schools such as Cornell, Co-
lumbia, Cincinnati and Geor-'.
getown. ° oi
A few of the objectives the -
Wildcats are hoping to achieve this
season are to establish individual
goals for each member of the team,
to be able to “read” the strength of
the schedule,-stay on the training
program and to position the team
for a “run for the roses,” meaning

a Big South Conference champi-
onship. Coach Price believes this

last goal is one the team isCertainly
capable of. Pe EYES:

The women’s tennis team re-
turns toaction this Tuesday against
Campbell University. The match
is on campus at 2:00.”
