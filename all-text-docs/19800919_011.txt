—The College should either
raise more money to relieve the
inadequate staffing and financ-
ing of minor sports or examine
some minor sports, particularly
wrestling, golf, track, and rid-
ing for viability.

Earlier, the committee had
recommended that the College
remain in the Southern Con-
ference. Athletic Advisory
Council Chairman David Shi
said these two statements are
contradictory since Southern
Conference regulations require a
school to have a minumum of 12
sports in Division IA to main-
tain IA status. Davidson now
has exactly the required 12, and
therefore cannot cut a men’s
minor sport without losing con-
ference membership.

— The College should esta-
blish ceilings on the number of
contests per season in particular
sports, as well as emphasize late
afternoon and weekend sche-
duling which does not conflict
with classes.

— The intramural program
should receive continued strong
support. Because of the degree
of student involvement in in-
tercollegiate and intramural

athletics, however, the physical

ments. ‘‘We felt they left a lot of

Spencer and Athletic Director

Eugene Bingham declined to
comment on the content of the
final report.

Athletic Advisory Councel
Chairman David Shi said the
report ‘‘pinpointed problems”
but ‘‘didn’t give many an-
swers.”’

Council member Louis Ort-
mayer pointed out that the
report was in many ways a ‘‘pat
on the back,”’ for athletics and
reflected the ‘‘professional and
personal interests” of the com-
mittee members, all of whom
are involved with athletics. The
Council had urged earlier in the
year that the evaluation be
conducted by people from all
areas of college life. ‘‘The
concerns some of us had when
we learned what the compostion
of the team was (all athletic
directors),’’ Shi said, ‘‘have
been borne out.”

Throughout the report, Shi
said, there is ‘‘an indication
that the institution and the
Wildcat Club are not support-
ing the athletie program ade-
quately.”’

Wildcat’ Club Executive Di-
rector Sandy Carnegie, al-
though he praised the report,
commented, ‘‘We do contribute
(to the athletic program) to the
extent we’ve been asked (by the
athletic department) to contri-
bute.”’

Ortmayer said he agreed with
the report’s strong emphasis on
women’s sports but disagreed
with the recommendation to
provide scholarships. ‘‘Most
women athletes (at Davidson)
don’t want scholarships.”’

As prescription for change,
the report is ‘‘helpful in some
respects’ but “‘disappointing”’
overall, according to Shi. Any
new directions taken, Ortmayer
predicted, will be in women’s
sports and fundraising.

In his closing comments,
committee member Peters
wrote, ‘‘I see Davidson as a
prestige institution of higher
education, and athletics as an
intregal part of higher educa-
tion. Anything less than our
report recommends would rele-
gate Davidson to something
less than preemjnence and
would be inconsistent.”

A copy of the report is
available at the library reserve
desk.

He gestured towards a plaque

This is how Bingham’s Athletic
Department will strive to serve

. students.

Bingham’s office is filled with
plaques and momentos. He uses
them to illustrate his philo-
sophy and highlight his life.

One wall shows him as a
student-athlete. In 1941 he
entered Davidson on a football
scholarship, one of the first
such scholarships the College
awarded. His Davidson career
was interrupted by four years in
the naval air corps, after which
he played another year of
foootball before injury forced
him to limit himself to track.
Below the sports photos are an

ODK certificate and a 1949.

diploma.

“The goal is to get the
excellent education.’’ Bingham
explained that he owed his
Davidson experience to his foot-
ball scholarship. It and money
from the G.I. Bill helped pay
the fees his coal miner father
couldn’t afford. A scholarship
meant he could compete against
the students who came from the

. best prep schools—and often
“beat them at their own game.”

On the opposite wall is a print
of a ship—‘‘a square rigger
under full sail. The set of the
sail determines course and
speed.’’ Bingham said he looked
for a ‘‘positive set of the sail’’
to symbolize the optimist’s
ability to find ‘‘opportunity in
difficulty.”” The pessimist, ac
cording to Bingham, finds ‘‘dif-
ficulty in opportunity.”

One opportunity the College
has is to mold upstanding
alumni. Bingham described
them as ‘“‘students in the class-
room, gentlemen and good citi-
zens on the campus, and Spar-
tans on the fields of compe-
tition.”

Those who would emphasize
classroom -priorities at the ex-
pense of athletics, Bingham

said, limit the Davidson educa-

tion. Sports like football ‘‘simu-
late real life situations’’ by
demanding “commitment” by
participants. ‘I can't empathize

munity. A plan to upgrade the
area would prevent such sprawl. °
Also, the revitalization plan is
designed to ‘‘insure the econo-
mic viability of downtown in the
future.”

Football costs. around $250

- thousand per year—‘‘two and a

quarter percent of the budget.
That’s not asking too much for
Sparta,” he said. But, he later
added, ‘Some people never go
out into the real world.”

Bingham does not doubt his
Davidson education prepared
him for the ‘‘real world’’—
including further military ser-
vice in Korea, a teaching job at
Purdue, and a leadership posi-
tion at Lincoln National Life
Insurance. Crippling arthritis
forced Bingham into early re-
tirement from Lincoln four
years ago—and into a wheel-
chair. Fortunately, extensive
medical treatments have allow-
ed Bingham to regain most of
his mobility.

On a disability penson and
bored with retirement, Bing-
ham expressed an interest to
Trustee Perrin Anderson sev-
eral months ago about moving
to the Davidson area and help-
ing out with College fundrais-
ing. When College President
Samuel Spencer called Bingham
in early August, Bingham ‘‘was
shocked.’’ His business exper-
ience, he thought, might make
him a likely candidate for a
position in Development —but
he never considered running the
Athletic Department.

Bingham is technically ‘on
loan’’ to Davidson from Lincoln
Insurance and consequently re-
ceives no salary .(He does collect
a pension from Lincoln). He
describes his new job as ‘‘a lot
more fun’’ and ‘‘more meaning-
ful’ than his long “ministry” in
life insurance.

Bingham said the “happiest
four years of my life were spent
here on this campus,’’ but noted
that Davidson today is ‘‘differ-
ent than when I was here. We
didn’t have all this heat and
divisiveness.’’ The school is too
much characterized by ‘‘poor
communications” among differ-
ent groups.

During: the interview, Bing-
ham got up to retrieve a.
Peanuts” comic strip he had
saved. In it Snoopy is compli-
mented on his good behavior
and laments that d.gs are only
praised when they do nothing.
Bingham thinks the same is
true of athletic directors. “I'm
going to get a lot of criticism
around here because I'm going
to do a lot.” he said.
