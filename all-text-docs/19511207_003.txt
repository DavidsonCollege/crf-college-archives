sible for this new surge of interest in wrestling as a spectator
sport and this was proved overwhelmingly by the crowds at the
latest tourney and the ones last Spring that brought some nation-
ally and internationally (the Japs and their Judo) famous wrest-
lers to the campus.

GOOD TALENT EXPLODED

Back to the intrafraternity tournament, it was a success
because it was so new and the fraternity men themselves were
interested in seeing their brothers “hit the mat” and also because
of the expedient manner in which the tournament was held. The
coaching staff contributed freely to the success and also the
wrestling team and coach. It went off well considering the new-
ness of the thing and the fact that there were so many entries
from the various groups.

The surprising thing was that a great deal of talent came
out of the tourney from boys who had never wrestled before or
never been out for wrestling. Most observers would probably
have gone down there those three nights just to laugh at their
buddy who had been crazy enough to try it out. However, many
a guy was surprised to find that there were some good wrestlers
or at least competitors in the tournament that they had no idea
could grapple in competition. °

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE COACH'S MEET

When the aggregation of Southern Conference coaches meet
on December 14, one of their most perplexing and most vital
questions that must be settled is the one of whether to continue
cooperating with the various bowl game committees when it
comes to furnishing teams for January 1 play. There has been
made only a ‘“‘suggestion’’ in favor of forbidding post season
play by any of its members. It was made by a committee and
almost immediately Jim Tatum accepted a Sugar Bowl bid for
his Maryland powerhouse.

The real basis of the problem seems to be whether to start
deemphasizing with a move to cut out bowl participation or con-
tinue on the liberal basis as before. The writer is prone to think
that the rule should go into effect for the coming calender year
and that if teams like Maryland, etc., want to continue with
‘their ‘‘power"’ football, they should be dropped from the roster
of Southern Conference Schools.

DEFINITE TREND TOWARD DE-EMPHASIS

The trend seems to be going definitely toward less em-
phasis on sports and Wallace Wade's office seems to be the com-
ing seat of closer controls. Already a committee of college presi-
dents and coaches are studying the matter and are presenting
new ideas daily on the national front.

Davidson will most surely profit by these controls and
thus be able to remain in the conference if the teams are put on
a more equal basis. And so not only from the standpoint of the
principle against ‘big-time’ football, but also by the fact that
one’s school will profit should lead one to support this drive
toward less freedom in hiring players, name coaches, and the’
big-time financial aspect of bowl-game participation.

Improvement

Over Last Year's Losing Squad

By BOB HAZARD
Out to better their present 1-1 record, the ‘‘scrappy Cats’’ of
Coach Boyd Baird will entertain Furman University’s Hurricanes
Saturday night in the Johnston Gymnasium. Game time will be

7:30 instead of the usual 8:15
being held at 9 o'clock.

Not too much is known of the
Greenville, S .C,, squad. One impos-
ing member, however, is six foot,
six inch Neill Gordon, a_ transfer
from Wingate Junior College, where
he was one of the leading scorers
in the Carolinas Junior College
conference for two years. He also
was selected for Junior College All-
American honors at the national
tournament in Kansas. In his de-
but against N. C.. State last Sat-
urday night, Gordon topped his
mates with 18 points, and also led
in rebounds, though the Wolfpack
dropped them 89-53. Also  out-
standing and up from the frosh
ranks is Selvey, who led the Fur-
man freshmen last year.

Captain Bill Brooks is pres-
ently leading the locals in the
scoring department with 39,
and is followed by Mac Mc-
Lean with 19, and Jerry King
with 14. Brooks is out to break
his last year's mark of 345.
Nine of his 39 markers have
come via the charity route, in
11 tries, and it looks as if he
will retain the high national
ranking he held last year in
this department.

The hardwood Wildcats played a
losing cause Tuesday night in en-
tertaining the N. C. State team. The
Raleigh Raiders, as usual, had too
much height and finesse and
walked away with a 74-48 decision,
their second Southern Conference
victory, the other being over the

because of the wrestling match

Presbyterian cagers’ Saturday foc,

Furman. In comparing scores,
State topped Furman by 36 points
and Davidson by 26—if compari-
sons mean anything.

Last year, Davidson over-
powered Furman twice in their
five conference victories, and it
ig hoped, naturally, that this
“streak”? will continue.

The starting tinewp will proba-
bly find Brooks and Al Fitzgerald
at forwards, Mclean and Don La-
zenby at the guards, and either Joe
Dudley or T. C. Coleman at Cen-

Swim Meet Next
On Frat Agenda

With the football and wrestling
pages torn from the intrafraternity
sports’ calender for this year, the
spotlight now swings to the battles
for honors in swimming, basket-
ball, and handball.

The eleven Greek-letter frats and
the Campus Club have been mak-
ing ready for the swimming meet
coming up next week. The pre-
liminaries are scheduled for next
Tuesday night and finals for the
following night. Last year’s meet
closed with the Sigma Chi’s and
the Kappa Sigs supplying the one-
two punch, The Sigs are out to
inake it two in a row, but much
preparation has been made by all
twelve squads and it looks like
there wifl be a good fight for the
swim. title.

Practice has also begun for the
cage season which is slated to begin
on Monday evening, January 7, on
the Johnston gym boards. Last
year's season ended with the Sigma
Chi’s again taking the top spot
in the standings.

This phase of the intrafraternity
program: has always had an en-
thusiastic following and if the teams
produced in former seasons are any
indication of the ones who will vie
for the coveted basketball crown
this year, the spectactors will sec
some great battles on the hard-
wood.

Also coming up soon will be the
handball totrney which is planned
to. be run off simultaneously with
thé basketball scramble.

Cats Want A Better Season,
Ready To Down Blues Again

The victors of the current three-
day trials will be rewarded with
starting berths against the power-
ful North Carolina grapplers to-
morrow night at Johnston Gym.
The trials which will end this aft-
ernoon climax three weeks of gruel-
ing work by the bouting Cats, For
the past several days Coach Paul
Scott and Charlie Parker have been
matching the contenders in cach
weight class in order to determine
who will face the Carolina grap-
plers. .

Although a few members are
seemingly assured of positions,
most of the starting berths will he

of the team competition is dis-

Aan RE A: AS:

Hyneria reigned from the moment he heard the
details of those quick-trick cigarette mildness tests.
First he giggled . . . then he guffawed . . .
wound-up rolling in the aisle! He knew that the
“single sniff” test or the “one puff” test didn’t
prove anything! Millions of smokers have

reached the same conclusion — there’s just one

test that really proves cigarette flavor and mildness!

It’s the sensible test. . . the 30-Day Camel
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try
Camels as your steady smoke — on a pack-after-pack,
day-after-day basis. No snap judgments! Once
you’ve enjoyed Camels for 30 days in your “T-Zone”
(T for Throat, T for Taste), you'll see why ...

After all the Mildness Tests...

Gene finished an impressive in-
dividual season last year by cop-
ping the 1951 State A.A.U. 123
pound title, This year he will be
grappling for laurels, but in’ the 130
pound field. As yet George “Bucky”
Irvin has not been able -to enter
the wrestling competition due to a
nose operation done this summer,
but indications are that he will re-
turn to the team sometime this sea-

Football season being over,
trainer Charlie Parker has returned
to his previous position as wrestling
coach. Paul Scott, who has been

on their way to another dismal
season, but the spirit is high among
the team members, cnd contrary
