Houchen’s Paintings Lack
Dominance Of Control

A REVIEW

By M. FINLEY TAYLOR
Staff Writer

Douglas Houhcens, Associate
Professor of Fine Arts, presents
a small show evident of his one-
ness of approach. This singular
itv of style develops through
his use of emotional ‘ine and
sensitive color application and
gives the works an. indefinite,
ulmost remote kind of absirac
tion.

On going closer to the
canvasses, the first recog-
nized form vanishes in the
moving lines and small color
splashes. The development from
Houchens'’ photographs of the
landscape and terrain of Mal
lorca (attached with the paint
ings) his expressionism comes
through a new approach to light.

Houchens was forced to work
from sii‘es Gue to poor weather
conditiens and insufficient light
most of the vear in Deva (the
community in which he and his
family lived)

This use of illuminated slides
posed new and_ intense ap-
proaches to light and its am
biguous effects. From this re-
sulted abstractions of lightness,
a quality of translucency.

Landscape, seascape, per
spective drawings, drawings of
his children. and geranium
plants are the subject matter.
The sensitiveness expressed de-
veloped as these subjects be
came of extreme importance in
the quiet, rather “primitive”
life on the island.

The painting ‘‘Torrente’’ is re
presentative of all Houchens’ ob-
jectives. The Torrente is a
stream in the village of Deya
where the people threw their
garbage. This subject relates on
an emotional basis.

In addition to the feeling, the
“fluid ambiguity’’ in the move-
ment of water, the movement
of the images, and the extreme
effort of light throughout the
depth of the stream imply a
sensitiveness already present in
Nature. Houchens said he found
in this the richest of abstract
qualities.

In his painting of. Torrente
the artist tries to capture its
layered abstractness, its play

of the natural light and the
feeling aroused by the grotes-
que scene. An emotionalism re-
sults that is seen in all of
Houchens’ works.

Houchens' work is locse and
trends to lack a dominance of
control. From the Mallorcan ex-
perience he found a new ap-
proach to light and he discov-
ered a different sensitivity but
overall he lacks a consiructive
hess within the sing!e work
which gives it a dynamic qual
ity necessary for the observer.

One can understand his work
and appreciate the experience
from which it is taken, but be
yond that it carries little im-
pression.

Martin Seeks Election To
House Of Representatives

By TODD EADES
Staff Writer

After three terms as Meck-
lenburg County Commissioner,
James G. Martin is running
for the United States House of
Representatives.

Associate Professor of Chem-
istry Martin announced his
candidacy for the Ninth District
seat December 20. He was the
first to declare his intentions
and will probably be the only
Republican to do so.

Next fall, instead of entering
his twelfth year of teaching
chemistry at Davidson, he will
campaign. Martin has received
a leave of absence from the
schocl for the fall term and
met what he called ‘‘a fair
response from the administra-
tion.” If elected, he will be the
second Davidson graduate to
serve in Congress.

Martin stated that being a
college professor would not be
a major factor in his campaign.
He will emphasize his experi-
ence in county government and
attempt to establish his own
philosophical position. He _ re-
gards himself as right of cen-
ter, aS a ‘‘moderate conserva-
tive.”

He stated four basic campaign
themes in his formal announ-
cement for candidacy. They are
the need for emphasis on local
government, a_ practical ap-
proach to environmental prob-
lems, a pledge to continue the
personal service performed for
congressional constituents, and
the value of a strong two-party
system of government.

Martin said that 18-21 year
olds and especially college stu-

dents will be a valuable part
of the campaign. There will be
a major effort to organize these
voters, especially since new and
young voter registration in Char-
lotte has been so poor.

It would be good to have a
professional scientist in Con-
gress Martin believes. He sup-
ports President Nixon on his
Vietnam policy of phased with-
drawal. He said he also support-
ed Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson in their Vietnam poli-
cies, but that the war was pro-
longed too long.

He hesitantly abides with
Nixon’s trip to China out of
deference to the Presidential
Office. But he did not like to
see Taiwan expelled from the
United Nations.

Before deciding to run, Mar-
tin had to answer the personal
question of changing profes-
sions, especially to a potentially
unstable political one. He feels
if he serves in Congress for

two years he would probably
return to teaching, but that four
years or more would be too
great a separation.

A problem that Republican
Martin faces is the Presidential
Primary in North Carolina this
spring. This will be the state’s
first Presidential Primary and
it will probably be dominated
by the Democratic candidates.
Many new voters might regis-
ter as Democrats to enable them
to vote in the Democratic Pri-
mary.

Asked whether President Nix-
on’s campaign will affect his
own, Martin said that the Pres-
ident's popularity is reflected
in every congressional race,
and that if the President is
popular it would probably have
a good coattail effect.

Martin is the only Republican
who has announced. Democrat
Jim Beatty is seeking the Dem-
ocratic nomination for the same
seat.
