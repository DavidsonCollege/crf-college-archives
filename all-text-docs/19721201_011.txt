Grandad Gridder Reviews Cat Career

Listen my children, and you
shall hear

Of my Davidson Wildcat
football career

It began in the fall of sixty-
nine

With = thirty-eight
teammates of mine

Those days of practice and
fear.

other

In fifty years I will be telling
that to my grandchildren,
telling them stories of Homer
and Dave and Ernie and Ah
Doo.

The first thing I did when I
arrived on the Davidson
campus as a_ée freshman
footballer was ask for a
football.

I had met Greg Gerdy at the
airport, and I thought he and I

would be Davidson's Unitas-
Berry combination. I needed a
ball to start getting ready.

I introduced myself to the
team the next day. I spoke to
Scotty Shipp and he let the rest
of the team know.

“They say that Bob Hayes
can run a 9.1 100-yard dash, ‘‘I

* told him, ‘but has 12-flat hands.

Well, I run a 12-flat 100-yard
dash, but I have 9.1 hands.”’

It was soon common
knowledge that no girl would go
out with me as fast as my hands
must be off the field. She’d be
raped and dead inside half of a
munute.

It was true that our freshman
team would have done anything
for the Wild Bull, Head Coach
Gene McEver. Nevertheless.
we were baffled by his plays.

“All right, you block him. and
you block him, and we'll call
this play five,” he'd say.

‘But, Coach, we already have
a five.”

“Okay, we'll call it six.”’

When he ran out of numbers
Coach McEver called the next
play ‘‘Something Special.”

Phaggs-Heroes, Delts-SAEs
Meet In IMAC 3-On-3 Semis

With the first four rounds of
competition completed, only
four teams remain to battle for
the IMAC three-on-three cage
tourney championship.

The Phighting Phaggs
continued their sweep toward
the title as they zapped Cannon
I, before arresting Allen’s
Arses. The Arses had earlier
wiped Horton’s Haggs.

The Phaggs then gunned
down Wag’s Wagoners to get
into the semis as the Wagoners
had earlier beaten. a good Watts
III team.

The Wagoners-Phaggs game
had an interesting sidelight. It
was played two-on-two, because
only two coaches showed. As
Wags put it, ‘‘It was three-on-
three, then one guy left and it
was two-on-two.”’

In a statement released
yesterday, Wags expressed
disappointment in the loss, but
said that the game was planned
to provide a ‘‘good time for all."’
A tough break for a great
competitor.

Skippers End
At USC Race

By JOHN McELVEEN
Staff Writer

The sailing team wrapped up
their fall season with a third
place finish in the South
Carolina Invitational Regatta.

Sailing ‘‘Penquins” in A-
division was Daryl Douglas
with Michael Mayer and Rickie
Williams alternating as crew.

‘“‘We sailed well and
consistently."’ noted Daryl, ‘‘as
can be seen by our second place
ranking in this division."

In B-division, Mark Leonard
skippered with David Francis as
his crew. They also ranked
second in their division.

Daryl noted that, ‘‘We kept
errors toa minimum.”

In reviewing the fall season,
Dary! commended both Frank
Somerville and Mark Leonard.

“They accomplished a lot;
both learned to sail while here
at Davidson. Now they can
compete with those skippers
who have been sailing for
years."

then fell to the Heroes, but not
before they had knocked off a
good Stretch and the Kids team.
Stretch and the Kids had earlier
clobbered Watts I.

A strong PGD team led by
Chris Young looked mighty
good in getting into their semi
spot.

First they shut off Finch’s
Farts and in fourth round action
they whipped Sentelle III.
Meanwhile a_ tournament
favorite, Sike’s Spikes, was
manhandling Pax 00 and’
Grandalf, Jeep and the Whizzer
in moving through the
competition.

But Monday night a_ hot
shooting PGD upset Sike’s
Ppikes, and moved into the
semis.

In the other semi bracket,
SAE grabbed the top spot by
beating a good Simm’s Sins
team.

Simm’s team had beaten
Watson Geese before adding
Team 1825 to their list. 1825 had
earlier nipped the colorful
Bethea’s Bombers to put them
out of the running.

The Es then only had to beat
Watts II before handing Simm’s
Sins a seat on the bench to
watch the rest of the .

The semifinals will be held
next Monday at 7 p.m. in the
gym. It will be the Phighting
Phags vs. Kelly's Heroes in one
game while the other ‘slot will
have PGD against SAE.

Finals will be held Dec. 6 at 7

p.m.
C. A. and Bucky are gonna go
out on a limb and pick the
Phaggs to wrap it up by beating.
PGD in the finals Wednesday.

Next issue we will have the
final result plus a look at C. A.
and Bucky's 1972-73 *‘College
All-Weinie Team.”’

I survived two years of Camp
Carolina. It is like an all-
expense paid trip to the 1936
Italian-Ethiopian war.

The coaches acted ugly
because they were away from
their wives. The players acted
ugly for dozens of reasons, most
of them having to do with the
four practices per day.

Any time there was no
practice the whole team would
be devoured by the rack
monster. The rack monster is a
sandman who meets Wildcat
standards. That is, the whole
team except for me would rack.
I used to like to go canoeing.

I remember the team
throwing the coaches into the
lake on the last night of camp. I
remember Rusty Bittner
chasing a nude’ Sean
McCormich around camp with
a garter snake.

In my football career I
survived countless legal fights,
innocently called circle drill or
board drill. 1 couldn't
understand why the guy across
from me wanted to take my
head off. All I wanted to do was
survive.

Everytime we had those drills
it seemed to me I faced Woody
Montgomery. I actually used to
tell myself that he was a wall I
had to run through, but it didn't

p.

I’ve seen 11 coaches since I’ve
been here, from Jimmy Jordan
to Dave Roberts. I have
inferred that they're all crazy; I
do have documented proff.

I remember the time Coach
Couch was intensely ired that

someone refused to practice
while 4 little hurt. He
threatened to put on the
player’s uniform and practice
himself.

In my career I1_ set
Davidson season records for
throwing up in one year and for
total number times running the
wrong way. My splinter
collection is second only to that
of Mike Creasman.

Nevertheless, I did something
I never thought I'd do. I
survived.
