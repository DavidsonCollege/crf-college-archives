Attempts to increase student
voice in curriculum studies dom-

dent Council meeting.

A plan for student critiques
of their courses was the fore-

‘{Most item of discussion.

The critiques, a plan largely
supported by the faculty, will
consist of student evaluation of
their professors and courses
through questionnaires supplied
by the Student Council.

Each professor will have the
option of participation in this
program. If a professor decides
to have his classes fill out these
questionnaires, the students will
fill them out befure the end of

Welsh’s ‘Joseph’ Opens

In Charlotte January

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

“Joseph,” an oratorio recent-
ly completed by Associate Pro-
fessor of Music Wilmer Welsh,
will premier at Ovens Audito-
rium in Charlotte Jan. 21.

The oratorio will be perform-
ed by the Oratorio Singers of
Charlotte. a group conducted by
Donald B. Plott, head of the
music department at Davidson.

According to Welsh, an ora-
toro is “an extended musical
p'ece that tells a dramatic story
without theatrical devices.” This
distinguishes it [from an opera,
which does employ theatrical
devices. The theme is usually of
a religious nature.

Welsh's oratorio tells the Old
Testament story of Joseph, from
the t'me he was g’ven the ‘coat
of many colors” by his father
through the time he received his
brothers again in Egypt.

The ser:pt. or libretto, was
written by Welsh’s wife, who is
active in theatrical groups and
has written several plays, ‘‘She
has completely preserved the
Bib!'cal flavor, even to the use
of the archa’c language of the
K'ng James version of the Bi-
bie,” said Welsh.

“fhe oratorio is scored for a
mixed double chorus,” he con-
tinued. “There will be four solo-
ists, of whom the tenor will sing
the part of Joseph. The oratorio
will be told by the narrator, who
is Robert Reed, formerly of the

1

television series ‘The Defend-

ers’.

The singers will be accom-
panied by the 40-piece orchestra
which regularly performs with
the singers. The orchestra in-
cludes several Davidson  stu-
dents.

Welsh conceived the idea of jr
this oratorio some 10 years ago
and has been working off and
on since then to complete it.
There are over 200 people in-
volved in the final production of
the oratorio.

“It’s a very big undertaking.”
commented Welsh. The prepa-
ration of scores, including the
work of copyists, bindings, etc.,
will cost over $2,000.

“Critics and spectators from
all over the country are coming
to view the production. The Ora-
torio Singers have been very
enthusiastic in practicing it.
The ticket sales have also been
a tremendous success thus far,
and only 300 seats are left.

“The oratorio seems to have
attracted a great deal of atten-
tion among Davidson alumni,”
he addded, “for I understand
they are sponsoring a banquet
before the performance. I cer-
tainly appreciate the warm re-

of Bil! Sands on the Davidson
student body.

Sands is a reformed convict
who spoke to the. student body
earlier this year. He received
the first standing ovation from
the Davidson chapel audience
that has been granted in three
years.

Hight concluded, ‘’They have
created a new voice that is
reaching today’s secondary
school student. It's not an older
generation speaking to a young-
er one.

“It is at 16, 17 and 18," he
concluded, “‘that they make fun-
damental decisions that affect
them the rest of their lives,”
and the program can ‘‘cause the
students to re-evaluate their pro-
gram in a better perspective.”

H. Edmunds White, director
of admissions, said, “Every re-
action that I have had has been
completely favorable.”

Both men stressed that the
purpose of the program is not to
sell Dav:dson, but to present col-
lege life from the student's point
of view.

Matthews held that such a

Several faculty members have
been questioned concerning this.
“They have no recollection of
such a statement having been

Martin Points Out
Previous Laxness

Additional campus security officers will be on duty

stricter enforcement. of drinking regulations, President
D. Grier Martin announced in a statement released this
week.

The measures result from statements made by stu-
dent leaders at a faculty meeting last week “that an in-
