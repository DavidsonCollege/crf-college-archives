Three pairs wish to help —
next year’s Freshmen

By STEPHEN GOLD

Staff Writer
_ Three pairs of hall counse-
lors will vie for the office of
Freshman Advisor presently
held by seniors Meg Campbell
and Bruce Holliday. First
Richardson counselor Eddie
Pollock and First Cannon
counselor Ann Hayes, First
Watts counselor Doug Horn
and Second Cannon counselor
Nancy MacConnachie, and
Third Richardson counselor
Ralph Yeilding and Fourth
Cannon counselor Cathy How-
ard.

The.office is the connecting
link between the administra-
tion the hall couselors, and the
freshman class. It is responsi-
ble for selecting and organi-
zing the hall counselors,
heading the Freshman Hall
Council, and helping Fresh-
men become adjusted.

Pollock and Hayes feel they
can work well together. They
say that the contact between
the advisors and the freshmen
has improved, and both wish
it to continue in this direction.

‘Working with the hall

counselors is important, but
so is keeping contact with each
freshman,”’ says Pollock. ‘‘We
can serve them better if we
know: them better.”’

The beginning of the Fresh-
man Hall Council was a real
benefit, they feel.

‘It is the only major
organization catering to fresh-
men,"’ Pollock continues. ‘‘We
wish to expand it to have more
freshman-upperclassman-
administration unity.”

“The position should take a
lot-6f dedication, and we're
willing,”’ concluded Hayes.

Horn and Macconachie ad-
mit to having planned to run
for the office together since
October.

‘We know where the trouble
spots are, from talking with
Meg (Campbell) and Bruce
(Holladay),’’ Horn mentions.
‘We feel we know everything
necessary. We've been toge-
ther planning since the begin-
ning of school.’’

They are willing to commit
the time, they claim, and they
have planned to have no
conflicts with the office.

‘We wish first to be advi-
’* says Macconachie.

They plan to get to know
the freshmen, visiting them

_and reaching them through
letters and the Wildcat Hand-

book early.

Also they consider the Hall
Council essential.

Upper classman-freshman
meetings and parties, to
‘break the ice,’’ would also be
important, along with getting
the freshmen active with a
service project.

‘‘We have considered the

job carefully,'’ concludes Mac-
connachie, ‘‘and we've talked
to advisors and freshmen. We
have ideas.”’

Yeilding and Howard con-
sider , hall counseling
a rewarding experi-
a rewarding experience, and
want to continue working in a
similar manner.

‘‘We are both extremely
interested,”’ starts Howard,
‘‘and want to continue the
successful work of Meg and
Bruce.”

Organization and efficiency
are vital, and the time needs to
be used wisely, they continue.
Creativity is also needed.

The Hall Council is a major
factor in their plans, as a
‘sounding board"’ for prob-
lems.

The training of the hall
counselors should include first
aid, they insist, and the
mechanics of the buildings
should be included in training.

Emphasis on the Honor
Code is also a plan, as well as
on IMAC sports, and service
projects for halls.

Howard concludes that they
both have experience.

‘‘Ralph was a sophomore
class senator, and worked with
the SGA course evaluation.
I've been freshman class sena-
tor, and am involved with
Council on Campus and Reli-
gious Life.”

Two subjects stressed by
each group were: more encour-
agement and time spent on
educating freshmen about eat-
ing houses and fraternities and
the superb job attributed to
Campbell and Holladay this
year.

will serve

as Y

president

mi Mee,

Wright, Dubose,
Niblock back him

By LYNN PEACE
Staff Writer

Juniors Glen Darbyshire,
Bonnie Wright, Beth Dubose
and Thomas Niblock will lead
the YM/YWCA beginning in
January.

These elections were uncon-
tested, and Darbyshire will
serve as President, Wright as
Vice-President, Dubose as
Secretary and Niblock as
Treasurer.

Wright views the present
organization as ‘‘a mechanism
to help get service projects
organized.”’

Niblock adds ‘‘We've had
a lot of resources many old
contacts, which are expecially
important.”

The officers plan to encour-
age further Patterson Court
adoption of YMCA projects.
They view Freshmen halls as
another resource for the Y to
explore.

They also express a need for
the training of tutors in the
STEP program, which com-

prises the bulk of the YMCA
program.

The executive board hopes
to examine and further plan
YMCA programs on a retreat
sometime during winter term.

The officers are enthusiastic
about the Christmas Fund
Drive for the George Reedy
Memorial Scholarship Fund,
set up for the Bushiangala
School, Kenya where Reedy
taught.

In earlier years, the YMCA
carried out a variety of func-
tions. It organized freshman
orientation, ran elections as
well as brought in speakers.
With the expansion of the
Student Union and formation
of new committees, the YMCA
took on a service oriented role.,

However, the participation
in depot lunches, organization
of the winterization of David-
son homes and the recently set
up Junior high coffee house
are all indications that the
YMCA will continue to be a
vital part of Davidson.

Cartmill announces improvements

The equipment check-out

room in the Gym will now be
open from 9 am to 12 pm on
weekdays and from 2 pm to 12
pm Saturdays and Sundays,
according to Director of Phy-
sical Education and Athletics
Thomas A. Cartmill.

Previously the room was
open from 9am to noon and
from 1:30 pm to 4 pm. It has
never been open during the
weekends. With the new hours
students will be able to check

out equipment’ all

During the evening and on

weekends the equipment ma-
nager will serve as a security
guard to patrol the gym.

The change in the equip-

day.

ment room hours is one of the
many changes Cartmill an-

nounced to the Senate Athletic-

Committee. He also plans to
move the Karate class from
the handball courts to another
area of the gym.

‘The class meets from 7 pm
to 9 pm of Tuesdays and
Thursdays. This prohits many
students from playing raquet
ball.’ Cartmill said. “I think
we can find a better place for
the class.”

Previously the weight room
and raquet ball courts have
been locked during home bas-
ketball games for reason of
security. From now on they
will be open, according to
Cartmill. ‘‘We can put some-
one to watch the doors and
stop any attempts of vanda-
lism and theft.”’

Cartmell expressed a desire
to stock the gym with more

equipment, but does not

know what the students want
or need,

“T know we will get more
basket balls and raquet ball
raquets. I. need the students’
help to decide what elso we
need.”

The Senate Athletic com-
mittee has agreed to circulate
a news letter and questionaire
after Christmas to determine
what the students’ want in the

way of equipment.

One Senate spokesman said,
‘We want to find out exactly
what. the priorities of the
students are.”’

Cartmill feels the question-
aire is important because he is
often unaware of the gym’s
needs.

‘‘For instance I did not
know the girls’ locker room
needed more towel racks and
soap dishes. There has been a

breakdown in communica-
tions, but when I know about

such problems I want to do
something.”’

He has issued a work order
to correct these problems.

Cartmill feels that, with the
increased usage of the wight

room, the gym might need to “

purchase a new universal
weight machine.

‘“More people are using the
loose weights than ever before.
They are a safety hazard if
students do not know how to
use them.”

Many students complain
gym has no gymnastic equip-
ment. Cartmill reports that we
have the equipment but no
room to put it in. He hopes
students will suggest a loca-
tion for the equipmnet on the
questionaire.

Other plans underway in-
clude horseback riding facili-
ties located about five miles
from the campus. The facili-
ties could be used for pleasur
riding as well as classes.

Cartmill is also considering
putting lights over some ten-
nis courts. He says, ‘‘The
senior class last year almost
financed the lights for us. I’m
still really excited about it. I
think getting lights in the near
future is a real possibility if I
have the assurance that is a
top priority of the student
body.” He hopes the question-
aire will indicate students
opinion about the lights.

One of the most difficult
problems facing the gym is
security.

Cartmill feels one way stu-
dents can help is to be more
aware of the problem and more
responsible in reporting any-
thing that looks suspicious.

“I am working on the
problem with the Senate Ath-
letic committde to come up
with a security play which will
be satisfactory to everyone.”
