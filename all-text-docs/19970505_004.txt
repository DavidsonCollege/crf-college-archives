4 THE DAVIDSONIAN a BACK PAGE INTERVIEW MONDAY, MAY 5, 1997

Just steps from the
house that will be his
on July 1, Bobby Vagt

outlines plans for his alma
mater and shows that business
and education meet...

Liz Sale:What contact have you
had with trustees, administration,
students and professors so far?
BV: In terms of just recently, or
over time?

LS: Both.

BV: Over time, I’ve had a varying
amount of contact with students and
faculty. The faculty I’ve had con-
tact with were involved in campus
events I was participated in,
Ashley’s professors and the few the
few faculty members that were
teaching while I was here. Stu-
dents, staff and trustees I’ ve met in-
dividually, but not as organized
groups.

Ann Culp: What da you intend to
do in the first 100 hundred days?
BV: One of the things I will tell you
is I find it impossible to say, ‘Here’s
a list of things I plan to do.’ .:. To
answer your question, in the first 90
days, I am going to be “Bobby the
Sponge.’ One’ of the things I’ve
found that you absolutely have to
do is go to each and every group
and find every person that will talk
to you and just absorb everything
they have to say.

I will tell you, I have 20 pages
of questions and none of them are
in any particular order or category.
I would just think about things and
write them down. To be honest with
you, that’s what that book [a folder
from Vice-President for Business
and Finance Robert Norfleet] is all
about, some answers to questions I
had. What I'll do is absorb this and
come back with more questions and
so on. And when I come in July,
T’ll sit down and'start putting all the
pieces of the institution together. I
think the hardest work has to come
in the first 100 days, but students
won’t be here that first part, so I’ll
have to play catch-up when you get
back. So I will tell you getting to
know the people and the process is
what I will be doing from this point
on. I wish I could make this more
romantic, but I’ ve done this before,
and this has to happen.

You have to find what it is you
are trying to do, figure out what the
resources are and what’s the most
effective way to do it. It can’t be
done alone. If you isolate all the
people that are going to a part of

_what’s going to happen, you’ ve shot
yourself in the foot. If you are ask-
ing what are the key areas, the cen-
tral issue of insuring the highest
quality education has the most im-
portance. Not losing sight of that,
the issue of the cost of an educa-
tion, and how do you balance it?
Strategic planning, which means
asking what are the priorities? The
financial element, resources to carry
out programs, is always controver-
sial with people. Because they
think in this day and age, you’re
talking about cutting finances.

Sometimes it does involve that, but,
on the other hand, what you’re re-
ally doing is trying to identify what
it is you’re really trying to do and
what’s available to best get it done
and making sure that the people that
are going to have to actually make
it work are on board.

AC: You spoke about getting to
know students, and you're going to
have to do that quickly. How do
you plan to get to know students
when we get back here?

BV: With 1600 students, it’s not
going to be easy. I hope to set-up
events like ice cream. socials, etc.,
and that is just one level.. I would
also like to wander the campus find-
ing students in everyday situations,
see them at speakers, campus
events, sporting events, cultural
events, art exhibits, whatever I have
to do. I’m really going to have to
work at it.

AC: Do you think not having an
academic background, teaching, is
going to a barrier in getting toknow
students?

LS: Will you be teaching?

BV: The classroom is clearly an
avenue for student contact. Unfor-
tunately, there is not a lot of time to
have that kind of interaction. So,
whether you’re from an academic
background or not, you can’t rely
on that insuring student contact. So
no, I don’t see that as a barrier in
getting to know students. However,
the idea has been brought up of me
teaching
a busi-
ness eth-
ics course
through
the Cen-
ter. There
might be
one or
Caw. =.0
things I
have
knowl-
edge on
and could
pass on in
a class.
LS: Do you think it’s going to be a
barrier for faculty?

BV: Let me say this, and I say it
because this was brought up the first
time I met your committee [Presi-
dential Search Committee]: there
are a lot of things happening and
will continue to happen down the
road that, to an extent, require the
services of someone with a Ph.D.
Now, we have a lot of great Ph.D.s
around here.

We’ve got the best, cream of
the crop. There’s no shortage of
those folks around here. To the ex-
tent of faculty and staff, we are all
working towards one end. We want
to provide you all with the best pos-
sible opportunities to grow in ey-
ery way. My not having a Ph.D. is
absolutely no impediment, in my
opinion, on how we as a commu-

STEPPING UP TO THE MIC

After meeting the media at his introductory press conference, Vagt answered our pressing
questions about Davidson’s and his future. Within five minutes of our interview, Bobby Vagt was
sharing his affinity for Pepsi and stories of how he married PiKA’s Dream Girl. Beyond being a
corporate giant, ordained minister, and past prison warden, he is extremely personable.

Bill Giduz

nity are going to provide the best
possible academic atmosphere for
you.

LS: Do you see your role with the
faculty as highly interactive or dis-
tant?

BV: You can see this as a strength
or a weakness, but if I’m involved
with a group, my only style is
highly interactive. I can’t get to
know someone from a distance. I

don’t read minds very well. The
only way I can know what makes
them happy, what makes them sad,
what they feel strongly about,
where they think I’m goofing up,
where they want to make sugges-
tions is to interact with them in a
pro-active way. :
LS: How did you go from prison
warden to the CEO of a natural re-
sources company?

BV: I can tell you the answer, but
then I’d have to kill you. ... If you
look at how I have evolved from job
to job, besides interest, the chain of
connection has been people.

LS: What will your role be with
Seagull come July? d
BV: I will be a director of Seagull
Corporation. International business
relationships are especially sensi-
tive, and there will be some period

of time when those folks may call
over here and ask my opinion, and
I will be advising them as a direc-
tor. An outside directorship can
help the Davidson community by
putting us out further in the world,
and I also can meet people that
might be able to do things for the
College periodically. I also feel it
will help me keep a broadened vi-
sion of things. Periodically, I may
have to go to Egypt or someplace
for busi-
ness, but
it will
never
take pre-
cedence
over the
College.
AC:
What
kind of
wisdom
will you
bring
from the
business
world to
Davidson?
BV: I have found that the process
organizations use to attain their
goals in the private or public sector
is not that different. I bring to
Davidson, I hope, the understand-
ing of this process. Also, colleges
and universities, in this day and age,
have to focus a fair amount of time
on financial concerns, and I have
read a number of balance sheets in
my time. However, the strategic
planning process is a fundamental,
and it is a comfortable process for
me. Sometimes, in the business
world, you are forced to make tough
decisions rapidly, and I have that
experience, but have no intention of
coming in and barking orders.

LS: What is your opinion on a pro-
vost at Davidson?

BV: There are some schools where
they have tried provosts, and they
have worked. Other schools have
had a very tough time with it. You ©
don’t mend administrative prob-
lems by adding another layer of
management. It doesn’t make
people coordinate. Forty to fifty
percent is the maximum amount of
time I will be away. from campus,
and I want to know everything that’s
going on. That doesn’t mean I make
all of the decisions, but only if I
know everything that’s going on
will I have all the data.

AC: What are your strategies to
nurture diversity at Davidson?
BV: First, there has to be a climate
and atmosphere that welcomes di-
versity from students and staff.
Secondly, there must be financial
resources that insure that anybody
who wants to come to Davidson has
the opportunity. I think the College
has the strategies for diversity, some
just need to be developed and re-
fined.

LS: What do think about the 13.5%
financial aid cap?

BV: It would be better if there were
no cap, but that kind of cap can only
be broken by outside money or the
rearrangement of current finances.
LS: What principals do you use to
govern horrible things like budget
cuts?

BV: There are no magic cures for
budget cuts. They can 2e antici-
pated and planned by a process that
everyone gets involved in so that the
decision can be understood by ev-
erybody. I look at it more like de-

fining priorities. We come to an

understanding of what we think is
important than plan the necessary
steps to make it happen.
