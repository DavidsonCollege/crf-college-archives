and development of the

her country. She told how these }
songs have been sung and added to
since the very beginning of  the|
language, and handed down from
generation to generation. Each
province, she said, has songs
which are related to the type of

people and to the occupation of its
inhabitants; Bretagne, for instance,
being on the coast, has songs of
the sea and fishermen.
