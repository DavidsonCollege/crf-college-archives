Prison Seminar Observes Pressures

By MARK SCHIEBLER

For the likes of Cool Hand
Luke, worse than any of the
everyday degradations of
prison life is the feeling that
society has abandoned him
and cares little whether he
lives or dies. Many argue that
this fact, above all, is whatcan
rob a man of his sensibilities
and render him unable to cope
later with the freedoms and
responsibilities outside the
fences.

This is the kind of tragedy
that many within the North
Carolina Department of
Corrections and Davidson
College have realized and are
trying to remedy at local
prison units.

For the third year, the David-
son Sociology Department and
Professor of Sociology Robert
Ruth are offering a seminar in
penology and criminal justice
in cooperation with the North
Carolina Corrections Depart-
ment.

Participants in the seminar
this past spring were assigned
internships at various prison
units in the Charlotte area.
These units include the
Charlotte, Dallas and Hun-
tersville Prison Units, the
Huntersville Women’s Prison
Unit and Women’s Halfway
House, and the new Hun-
tersville Diagnostic Center.

Over the past 10 weeks, in-
terns have met and talked ex-
tensively with inmates at each
of these correction centers.

“The kind of exposure these
students are getting is essen-
tial to any real understanding
of the workings of the correc-
tion system. I think we all
agree that it’s invaluable,”
Ruth said.

Jim Plumley, coordinator of
inmate activities at the Hun-

that there are those outside
who are interested in them.

“It has also shown the com-
munity that the Department of
Corrections has nothing to
hide anymore. We want to
show outsiders a little of what
prison life is really like. How
else could they ever hope to
understand what goes on
here?”

Plumley added that there
are also problems in the intern
program that are inherent in
the entire correction system.
“First, you've got to remem-
ber that the people here are so
unpredictable, much more
than they would be on the out-
side.

“The inmates are under

or other outside activities.

“This is why some in the
corrections department feel
it’s wrong to tempt the in-
mates with things such as the
intern system. And naturally,
some inmates just aren't

to handle the temp-
tation after being locked up
for so long,’’ Plumley said.

Stovall added that, ‘‘you can
never orient yourself to what
goes on around here. You can
never take anything for gran-
ted; you'll expect an inmate to
act one way and then he'll turn
around and do just the op-
posite. You get to where
you're skeptical, not negative,
but skeptical - of nearly
everything, and you almost
have to be.”’

Inmate complaints to the
outsiders are commonly of
such things as institutional
boredom and quick, violent
outbursts. Many inmates con-
tend that strong cliques form,
usually along color lines, and
that one’s color will go a long
way to determine where he
will fit into the yard heirar-
chy. Others complain that the
vibrant cannot be
channeled into creative ex-
pression because of the lack of
facilities for this.

Stovall says that in his job,
he is forced to walk a fine line,
pleasing the state officials and
at the same time, giving the
benefit of the doubt to the in-
mate when he feels it is
merited.

“All of us here sincerely
want to do the best we can.
Sometimes I'll do something
and later ask myself why I did
it. Sometimes we _ get
pressured and rushed into
decisions that we regret
later,’’ he said.

Currently, VISTA is also
operating within many of the
local prison units. VISTA
Volunteer Tim Lahey has been
at the Huntersville Unit for 18
months. He said that in the

VISTA has tried to help

“We tried this, but it was all
too hap-hazzard. Now, each

volunteer is assigned a group
of about 15 inmates and is
responsible for recreational,

programs for the group,” he
said.

Plumley explained that

center has recently been built
on the east side of Huntersville
and while men are processed
through it, they are housed at
the prison unit.

Plumley added that there
are three classifications of
honor status that will in part
determine an_ inmate’s
custody standing. They are: B
status, A status, and Honor
Grade.

All misdemeanor convicts
are automatically classified
as Honor Grade and are taken
to minimum security units.
