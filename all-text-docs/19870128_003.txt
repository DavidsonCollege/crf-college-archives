‘Student team addresses admissions problems

By GEORGE KURANI

Davidson's Student Admis-
sions Team held this year’s first
meeting on Jan. 21 at 5 p.m. Now
several years in existence, the
team will pursue condidates in an
attempt to give applicants a realis-
tic impression of Davidson life.

Surveys have shown that a
number of elements have an influ-
ence on a student's choice of col-
lege, including the applicants
sense of identifying with an in-
stitution and knowing that it will
be a good match for his abilities
and needs. This “personal ele-
ment” arises from campus visits as
well as contact with present stu-
dents.

Although the college tries to
convey a personal message in its

recruiting publications, the Stu-
dent Admissions Team hopes to
add to Davidson's impression by
talking with applicants in an open-
minded atmosphere.

Laurel Buchmiller, senior ad-
missions counselor, said that the
focus of the team is involving stu-
dents in the total recruitment ef-

fort. By the end of his junior year

in high school, a student has prob-
ably selected a number of possible
colleges on the basis of his high
school achievement. The admis-
sions program's job is to be in-
volved in recruitment efforts that
will insure Davidson a high visi-
bility to attract good applicants.
“A strong applicant will usu-
ally have to make a choice be-
tween a number of good col- —

leges,” said Buchmiller.- “Be-
cause Davidson has such an em-
phasis on its personal touch, the
Student Admissions Team will be
a perfect vehicle for us. They will
try to make sure that a student has
an understanding of the social and
academic offerings that are avail-
able at Davidson, while at the
same time trying to diffuse an
applicant’s fear of the unknown
through continued contact.”
“Members of the Student Ad-
missions Team do not perceive
themselves as salesmen for
Davidson,” added Buchmiller.
“Rather, they are a great resource
for answering quesions about liv-
ing and educational experiences

here.”

last year Davidson had 2057

applicants of which 29 percent, or
604 students, were accepted. Of
the accepted applicants, 348 de-
cided to attend Davidson. bring-
ing the yield to 58 percent, which
is considered excellent. The Ad-
missions Office is expecting as
many or more applications this
year and is impressed with the
number and quality of applicants
so far.

While the Student Admissions
Team will contact a large number
of students, it will be generally re-
stricted to talking with stronger
applicants. Members of the team
will send letters or call in an effort
to introduce themselves as a stu-
dent contact at Davidson.

In future years the Student Ad-
missions Team im hopes to initiate a

‘3

fall visitation program to high
schools across the country. Mem-
bers of the program would meet
with counselors or headmasters to
provide information on Davidson
which could then be passed down
to students. A follow-up program
would be instituted in the spring.

Student Admissions Team
members are seeking a large
number of Davidson students to
get involved with the program.
They are-looking for students with
a variety of interests from as many
different geographical regions as
possible. Anyone interested in
working with the student Admis-
sions team should contact Laurel
Buchmiller at the Admissions Of-
fice.

He also noted that support
from other countries in the form of
divestment can only help speed
the inevitable process of change.
The white rulers have said divest-
ment will hurt only blacks but. ac-
cording to Magubane, this asser-
tion is false.

Both sides will suffer. For the
first time since 1930 whites in
South Africa aré experiencing the
poverty common among the sup-

workers, mostly whites, who will
be hurt when interests are with-
