Davidson's Degas: Mah; ...

By BILL MOFFETT

Don Mahy is a guy you're glad
you've gone to school with.

The array of potentially well-to-
do physicians, lawyers, and busi-
nessmen among graduating David-
sonians is disgustingly formidable.

. Frankly, the monotony of it all is
often very boring, and when one
discovers a fellow like Don in the
midst of this bourgeois desert he
greets the refreshing surprise with
as much pleasure and relief as a
lost Sahara caravan sighting the
reassuring palms of an oasis.

For Maby is unique in that he
is not pre-med, pre-min, or pre-
business, but is pre-artist. He’s
good, even now, and he’s going to
be better.

Of course, Don is by no means
a@ matured artist, but one sees in
him a genuinely creative spirit,
confident in his ambitions, and
striving to perfect the technique
with which he seeks to express
himself. The rising tenor of his
experiments in style and technique
seems to indicate that his aspira-
tions are based on an authentic ap-
preciation of art as well as a great
amount of skill.

Here at Davidson his work has
taken a considerable variety of ap-
pearances, From magazine covers
to newspaper cartoons, from year-
book illustrations and oil portraits
to woodcuts and sculpture, from
the design on the Artist Series pro-
grams to still lifes, we are con-
tinually treated to the ingenuity
and resourcefulness of the Phila-

delphian.

A visitor to his apartment has
to think twice to remember that
he is in the Cardboard—not Green-
wich—Village. Paintings of all
kinds cover the walls. From the
workshop in the back comes the
unmistakable smell of turpentine
and oils. A partially finished bust
stands neat a sheaf of sketches at
his desk, and a curious mobile is
suspended from the ceiling. A nude
study by the window completes the
Bohemian scene.

When one realizes that these
works may well represent the first
efforts of a really outstanding
artist, there is a distinct thrill that
comes in hearing him explain the
ideas’ back of a particular picture,
what made him want to paint it,
and how he achieved his objective.

His paintings vary a great deal
in subject matter, but usually at-
tempt to tell a story, or at least to
set forth ideas which guide the
viewer to understand the artist’s
own experience.

On the other hand, his sculpture
is largely the development of form
and shape, and does not necessari-
ly depict any one person or thing.
Much of it reflects his earnest,
softspoken nature, and his gentle
wit.

Don's background is as interest-
ing as his paintings. His boyhood

was spent in the Shantung penin-

sula of northern China where his
parents were missionaries. Perhaps

it was there, watching for hours
the intricate and painstaking ef-

should fail to negotiate a truce
with the Communists, the Ameri-

colonial privileges in Indochina

to the Communists, many far-

work today.

The Mahys were forced by the
Communists to give up their work
in China and after World War I
they moved to the Philippines
where Don finished high school.
Incidentally, he spent much of his
spare time there carving little
heads and figures from the hun-
dreds of coconuts cast up as drift-
wood on the beaches. These same
droll faces were later to become
familiar to us as the characters of
his cartoons. e

Don decided to go into art pro-
fessionally after coming to David-
son. He has worked under Phil
Moose and Doug Houchens, and

studied last summer in a Maine art
school.

A $800 prze awarded him
this past week in a statewide art
contest will enable him to spend
the summer in Mexico, where he
will study Mexican fresco work, as
well as continue his own painting.
In the fall he goes to Washington
University,in St. Louis on a Wood-
row Wilson scholarship. An M. A.
in English will enable him to teach
school, but he hopes that this will
be only temporary/ Ultimately he
hopes to make art a full-time
proposition.

Perhaps the name of Mahy will
never rank with Raphael or Rem-
brandt, and then again, it might
rise to new heights. At any rate,
he’s a guy you can be glad you've
gone to school with.

vital to us that we should send
troops in even to defend a colony
of. another power, the opposition
to such a move would be every
bit as vocal if not more so than
if he took the first alternative.
It appears that the only hope
we have in this matter is that
Secretary Dulles will be able to
prevail upon the reason of the
French to convince them of the
importance of Indochina in the
struggle against the Communist ad-
vance. Failure to do so might very
possibly mean a great deal more
grief for the Western Allies in

future years.

the country. He attehded the
Skowhegan School on a working
scholarship, studying painting
under Jack Levine and Henry Var-
num Poor, and sculpture under
Milton Hebald.

Mahy intends to use the $300
scholarship award for study this
summer in Guadalajara, Mexico.
The art school in Guadalajara is
sponsored jointly by Stanford Uni-
versity and the Universidad
Autonoma de Guadalajara.

At Guadalajara Mahy will study
fresco mural painting under Al-
fonso Maro Medina, landscape
panting under Julio Vidrio, and
sculpture under Ofelia Arismendi.
Miss Arismendi is considered one
of the two best sculptors in Mexico
by Diego Rivera, the international-
ly famous Mexican artist.

The Federation of Art competi-
tion is open to works in sculpture,
the graphic arts, and paintings in
oil, watercolor and mixed media.
Don Mahy’s winning entry was an
oil painting on a 16x25 inch ma-
sonite panel, a still life study
stressing design and close color
harmony. The painting, entitled,
“Red Table Still Life,” was ex-
hibited in Raleigh and in Asheville
at the presentation of the scholar-
ship award.

. Max Devane, the poor man’s! |

Eisenhower, claims Jennings, Fla.,
as his home’ base. Having pulled
time in boy’s work, on the Student
Council, and as a counselor for two
years, has was not only well quali-
fied but has capably proved his
abilities as Freshman Adviser, that
unheralded general and fatherly
counselor of the “green-eyed” con-
fusion.

“General” Devane, a_ history
major, hopes to continue his edu-

“gt

cation at Vanderbilt U. under the!

Fellowship in Teaching which he
was just awarded. Postponing mar-
riage, if she will grant a defer-
ment, until completion of his two

years of devoted duty to Uncle ‘
Sam, he then plans to enter edu-|&,

cational administration in a
secondary school system.

His activity record, reading like
a Cunningham introduction, in-
cludes being president of the
sophomore class, second vice presi-
dent of the student body, three
years on the Student Council, Phi
Delta Theta pledge master, a Baker
Scholar, active in the Beaver Club,
Scabbard & Blade, D Club, Le
Cercle Francais, Phi Society, IFC,
and Regimental Commander of the
Davidson ROTC unit. This year he
was elected to ODK and “Who's

Who.”

Freshman Adviser

The post of Freshman Adviser,
who is elected by the rising senior
class, is an interesting and varied
one. His duties, though profuse
in nature, may be divided into
two main categories or time se-
quences. The first of these is
orientation.

Before the last schoo] year was
completed, Max chose a capable
group of nineteen men from the
ranks of the YMCA cabinet and
Student Council roster to serve as
student counselors. He kept in con-
tact with them and Dean Bailey
throughout the summer months,

informing them of the proposed
programs and seeing that such
articles as the Wildcat Handbook
and freshmen letters were proper-
ly sent out.

Then on the ill-fated 12 Sept.
1953, orientation drill began under
Commander Devane and his execu-
tives. The counselors, working in
conjunction with the corps of facul-
ty advisors, served as time guides
and instruction leaders for the fast-
learning frosh.

The freshman adviser, supervis-
ing the student side of the ma-
neuvers, saw that the program
functioned smoothly and en-
deavored to become personally ac-
quainted with his '57 army. The
entire program, lasting approxi-
mately a week, was quite success-
ful in accomplishments, leaving
more time than in previous years
for the frosh to get acquainted
with the campus and make full use
of group discussions.

The other function of the FA
covers those particular problems,
programs and plans which con-
cern the freshman elass through-
out the remainder of the year. It

Max has represented the fresh-
men on the YMCA Cabinet, and the
Student Council; conducted fresh-
men elections for class officers;
and given them the annual “treat-
ment” test on the Constitution and
‘Student Body Regulations. To his
dismay and shattered hopes, the
87 class “gave little evidence of
study,” which the recipients of
Court of Control awards well re-
member.

An interesting and quite suc-
cessful facet of his work this year
has been the Freshman-Parent Day.

The program, originated this
year by Dr. Spencer and aided by
C. Shaw Smith of the Union, was
enjoyed with much enthusiasm,
and many letters of appreciation
were received afterwards. Held on
last November 21, the day’s agenda
included a Davidson football game,
informal campus tours, conferences
and faculty-parents discussions. In
hopes that the program will con-
tinue to be beneficial to fresh-
men, parents, and faculty, the ad-
ministration has decided to make
it an annual fall affair.

Another new development this
year was the Freshman Y Council
plan, originated by Sam Magill.
Each orientation group elected two
men from which the directory of
five men was chosen. They worked
closely with Mr. Magill in planning

certain functions. It is an area in
which the FA can be instrumental
in creating a more active fresh-
man program.

Asked for his opinion of the ’57
class of Rebels, Commander Devane
merely replied: “They certainly
had a nationalistic spirit,” which
worked for the good of some, tbe
detriment of most, and the ac-
celerated aging of the FA.”
