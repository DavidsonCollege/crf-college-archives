GOOD ATHLETIC PROGRAM

Y. M. C. A. Gathering Draws Larger
Number of Men Each Year

June 17, through June 26, marks the time
when the footsteps of many Southern col-
lege men will lead toward Blue Ridge, the
shrine to which come yearly. hundreds of
student Y. M. C. A. members. This year’s
conference will compass a period of 10 days,
during which time, men from colleges over
the entire South will meet in an association
which will be of infinite help to each of them
in the making of life- long friends.

The name of Blue Ridge and Blue Ridge
Conferences brings ideas of only clean in-
tellectual, social, spiritual and physical de-
velopment of men who there associate them-

selves for a broadening of their lives. Lo-
cated in the lofty mountains of North
Carolina, synonymous with perfect health

and happiness, it has for 22 years been the
scene of gatherings for large numbers of
men of intense college and Christian spirit.
It is both a recreation and a re-creation for
men who have just finished the hard grind
of nine months in school, and coming just
at the close of the college year, has come
to be looked upon by many as essential to
the rounding out of a vacation.

The program is one of intense application,
of audience to the best of speakers, of dis-
cussion of vital questions of the day, of con-
ferences on association and college work,
and, most of all, of association with other
students in every phase of life, in discussion

Epsilon Chapter of Pi .
Kappa Phi Reinstated

Kappa Phi Local to Receive National
Charter Tuesday at Charlotte

Announcement has been made by the Pi
Kappa Phi national officers that the petition
of Kappa Phi (local) for the re-installation
of Epsilon Chapter in Davidson College has
been granted and that the initiation cere-
monies and the installation banquet will be
held in Charlotte on Tuesday, May 20.

Kappa Phi was organized during the past
session for the purpose of obtaining a re-
installation of Epsilon Chapter of Pi Kappa
Phi which was withdrawn from the college
in 1918 on account of the depletion of its
membership during the period of the war.
At the national convention of Pi Kappa Phi,
held in Atlanta during the past Christmas
holidays, it was voted to dispense with 4”one-
year rule for locals then in effect, due to
the fact that the Davidson group was peti-
tioning for a re-installation, and to consider
immediately the petition of Kappa Phi. The
action was favorable and preparations are
being made for the initiation of the local
group at Charlotte on the 20th.

The advent of Pi Kappa Phi brings the
total number of national fraternities to eight.
A majority of the credit for the bringing of
Pi Kappa Phi back upon the campus is due
to the Alumni Chapter in Charlotte and to
the persistent work of M. C. Stith, ex-’26, a
member of Chi Chapter, of Stetson Univer-
sity.

The present roll of Kappa Phi is as fol-
lows: C. M. Brown, E. T. Buck, J. W.
Curdts, J. C. Fowler, W. M. Gracy, J. H.
Hall, Jr, W. M. Heston, C. P. Johnston,
F. C. Kugler, Kenneth Lewis, R. L. Price,
E. T. Pullen, Jr., J. M. Selser, H. L. Shaw,
Jr., C. M. Streibich, and B. W. Williams.

PATTON AND BRIGGS
WILL MANAGE
TEAMS

At the last meeting of the Athletic
Council, J. H. Patton was selected to
manage the track team for next year.
At the same meeting Julian Briggs
was elected to manage the baseball
team,

These two men were the first to be
elected by the new method which was
passed by the student body a
weeks ago.

Both men are prominent leaders on
the campus, Patton being president of
the Glee Club for next year. Briggs
is president-elect of the rising Senior
class,

These men, both by their ability as
managers, and on account of popular-
ity on the Hill, are expected to make
the business end of their respective
seasons a success.
