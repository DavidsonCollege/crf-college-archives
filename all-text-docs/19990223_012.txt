THE DAVIDSONIAN

Tree of the Week: Okame Cherry

By BriaN CAMPBELL
The Tree Guy

The natural world reveals to us the continuity
and the rhythm of life’s cycles. Remembering the
patterns of the past we find the assurance that each
day will bring a new sunrise and each spring will
bring new growth. But the cycles of nature some-
how resist the desensitized and deadened ways in
which we so often experience repetition. Each
new sunrise is full of wonder and the first blos-
soms of spring make us stop to see and smell their
surprising beauty. This week, the four Okame
Cherry (Prunus x incamp) are spectacular with
their pinkish white flowers. The sudden changes
in these trees may symbolize life’s surprises.

The Okame cherry is a species that was

introduced where? in 1947 by British cherry breeder
Collingwood Ingram. This hybrid of Prunus
campanulata and Prunus incisa is able to with-
stand more harsh conditions than many other beau-
tiful cherries. Its popularity has grown rapidly
among gardeners and horticulturists.

The tree is known more forits showy flowers
than for its shady branches. Similar to most
cherries, the wine-red bark is smooth with a pol-
ished looking shine. The leaves, light ‘green in
spring, grow darker by summer. This week, how-
ever, it is the cherry’s blossoms that strike us as
they cover the leafless branches with color. Look
closely. These blooms are nicely shaped as well.
Dangling gently, they give the tree its name in
Taiwan and parts of East Asia, where it is known
as the “Bell-flowered cherry.”
