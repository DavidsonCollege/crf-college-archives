Reevaluating sub-free

Committee sponsors campus-wide survey on policy

By KATE GILLESPIE
Senior Staff Writer

A committee led by Dean of
Students Tom Shandley and
Associate Dean of Students Leslie
Marsicano is reviewing substance-
free housing options at Davidson.

As part of this effort, the com-
mittee is sponsoring a survey to
determine students opinions.

Using the results of the survey,
the committee will make recom-
mendations to President Vagt, who
will review and _— evaluate
Davidson’s current sub-free policy.

While no clear timeframe is in
place, committee members hope to
make a recommendation in the
next two weeks.

The committee on sub-free hous-
ing was formed last fall and, in
addition to  Shandley and
Marsicano, consists of seven stu-
dents who represent diverse opin-
ions on the issue.

The group includes a hall coun-
selor and a representation of stu-
dents who have and have not lived
in sub-free housing.

Shandley appointed the commit-
tee after a group led by SGA
Senator Mac Skelton ‘07
approached him and President
Bobby Vagt at the end of last spring
semester with concerns about sub-
free housing.

“I felt very strongly that sub-
stance-free housing needed to be
reevaluated. Fortunately, the deans
were very receptive to the idea of
forming a committee and determin-
ing whether changes needed to be

made,” Skelton said.

The survey will be sent to all stu-
dents via email next week and will
ask students to identify their rea-
sons for choosing or not choosing
to live in sub-free housing.

“We are asking people about -
their experiences if they have lived
in sub-free,” said Marsicano. “If
they have not lived in sub-free, we
are asking them what their opin-
ions are.”

Students will also be asked to list
their preferences among several
different designs of sub-free hous-
ing and to state whether the exis-
tence of sub-free housing at
Davidson was a factor in their col-
lege decisions.

The committee examined sub-
free options at colleges and univer-
sities with which Davidson com-
petes for students and has also
sponsored six focus groups on the
issue. Three of the groups met
before Christmas break, and the
other three will meet this week.

“T must emphasize that this is not
a committee about getting rid of
sub-free housing,” said committee

“member Michael Flake ’06. “This
‘ is a blatant misrepresentation about

what we are doing. We are review-
ing the sub-free housing option.
We have had sub-free housing for
over ten years, but there has never
been a formal study of it. Maybe
we will change it slightly, maybe
we will get rid of it, or maybe we
will leave it unchanged.

Finding a seat

High enrollment, fewer professors
possible factors in over-capacity classes

By Davib Crow
Editor-in-Chief Emeritus

The large number of classes that
are at or Over capacity this semes-
ter has left many Davidson profes-
sors wishing for smaller classes
and more professors.

“People in the Religion
Department do feel the pressure of
full classes and feel pressure to
raise class ceilings,” said Dr. Karl
Plank, Professor and Chair of the
Religion Department. “I think most
in the department would say we’re
strained.”

Other department
expressed similar concern.

Dr. Mary Thornberry, Professor
and Chair of the Political Science
Department, said, “It would always

heads

be nicer to have smaller classes.

- We would like to have all of our

classes have ceilings of 20-25
instead of 30.”

The Political Science
Department has been especially
hard hit this year when one visiting
professor replaced two full-time
professors who each left on a year-
long sabbatical.

“We are fortunate to have
[Visiting Professor] Amy Oakes,
but even with her we still are five
classes short of where we usually
are,” said Thornberry. _

The Spanish Department, which
just added an additional professor
this year, has had many classes
overfilled this semester.

CoHo struggles to maintain presence on campus

By ZACH KAZIOR
Senior Staff Writer

Despite a significant drop in
membership and subsequent finan-
cial problems, CoHo maintains that
it will be staying at Davidson next
semester, as it intends to re-work
its budget and introduce new meth-
ods to attain a stronger presence on
campus.

A decrease in interest and, con-
sequentially, membership — has
resulted in financial troubles for
the eating house.

Last semester, CoHo paid nearly
$2000 of its $4000 debt to the col-
lege; however, it still

owes

$1634.04 plus $1600 to the house -
treasurer, Anne Pearlstein ’06.

“Tam not exactly sure how we
arrived at this financial situation,
but I believe it has a lot to do with
our former cook going over budget
and the fact that our membership
and interest seems to be dropping
off,” said CoHo president Aubrey
Groves ’06.

“The cause behind this, I think,
is that we still have not really
defined what CoHo is about and
how we want to be perceived.
CoHo has been kind of floating
along, and now it is time for us to
reflect and decide what we want to
be.”

CoHo says that it must become
more involved in campus activities
and recruit more actively.

According to Groves, “We need

to remind the campus that we are.

still very much alive. We also need
people to get to know the house
members, because we are a really
fun bunch.

“We know that some people will
want to join at the other fine estab-
lishments on the court, but we want
to try and find the group of people
that mesh with our house’s person-
ality best and encourage them to
join.” »

CoHo has currently been looking
for ideas about how to put their

objectives into action.

“We have been brainstorming
some ideas at dinners and at meet-
ings, and I must say that the house
members just refuse to be discour-
aged and are willing to do anything
to get the house back in the black,”
Groves said. “They make my job
so much easier. We are prioritizing
some of the aspects of our budget,
and we also plan to do a few more
social events and hope to collabo-
rate with some of the other houses
on the court to do so.”

Groves also cited fundraising as
a major priority, as well as the
organization of a major service

Cable to leave

Davidson for

UVA in March

By BRANDON CARROLL
Editor-in-Chief

After 13 years at Davidson
College, Vice President and Dean
of Admission and Financial Aid
Nancy Cable is leaving Davidson
amid another year of record appli-
cations.

Cable will join the University of
Virginia in the joint capacity as
Associate Dean and Vice President
of Development of the School of
Engineering, and as Director of the
Virginia Engineering Foundation,
the alumni organization.

Cable’s last day at Davidson will
be March 25. She will begin her
new job in April, though she indi-
cated a willingness to finish what
she had started with the class of |
2009.

“I will come back if asked,” she
said when asked what her role
would be during April scholarship
interviews.

Of her decision, Cable said, “I
have been offered other positions
during the time I’ve been here.
This one seems like the right one,
and the timing is even better.”

In part, Cable said that timing
had to do with her family. One
daughter, Katie, recently enrolled
in Bowdoin College. Another,
Gretchen, is now a high school sen-
ior and will be able to finish with-
out being displaced.

President Vagt said Davidson
would wait until mid-February,
after cross-country admissions
crunch time, to begin national
advertising for a replacement. They
would then want to have candi-
