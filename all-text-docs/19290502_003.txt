From Diamond and Cinder

P. R. ALDERMAN

The netmen seem to have hit their
stride at last, but just a little too late
for the State tournament. Capt. Rod-
dey and his men didn’t have much
trouble defeating the best teams in Vir-
ginia, showing up much better flfan
they did in the State meet a couple of
weeks ago. Prospects are mighty
bright for a championship net team
next year as Roddey is the oly man
to be lost by graduation. His is going
to be a hard place to fill, however, and
will very probably not be occupied by
as capable a racketeer as he.

The fresh diamond men didn’t
fare so well away from home on
their trip against other first year
teams, Duke, State and Wake
Forest defeating them successively.
Practically all of the teams played
the first of the season were here
and with Junior colleges or high
schools which in a way account for
the apparent let-down of the fresh.
They put up good games each time,
however, but this was counteracted
by the number of errors made.
Miscues was the real cause of the
defeat by State and the fresh
would have won but for their in-
ability to handle the pill.

The latest forms of interclass ath-
letics to bé installed by Capt. Pritchett
are in the way of golf and tennis. Ar-
rangements have already been made
for tournaments in these two sports
and a number of men from all the
classes have entered. There is a two-
fold good in these intra-mural sports:
first, they serve to upbuild physically
the members of the student body not
on some of the college teams; and
second, they are valuable in uncover-
ing any hidden talent or ability in the
form of athletics.

Well, the diamond season is rap-
idly drawing to a close as far as .

lleges are ned, in which
case this also applies to the Wild-
cat nine. In reviewing the results
of games throughout the season it is
seen that the Cat team has broken
about even for the whole season in
contests won and lost. And so the
verdict is an average team and an
average season. But, when it is
taken into account that five of the
regulars are on the varsity for the
first time, it brightens up things
for this year as well as next.

Davidson in general and the coaching
staff and teams in particular are very
lucky in having “Red” Laird back
again next year as assistant coach. As
those men who knew “Red” while he
was a student here—he was a mem-
ber of ’26—will attest he was‘an out-
standing man in various forms of ath-
letics while a member of the student
body, being a three-letter man in ma-
jor sports and awarded the Norris
Trophy his Soph year. He has no
definite position for next year but will
probably spend most of his time with
the fresh teams.

Although the Cats lost the game
to Duke they hit hard enough in
it and the State game to bring the
batting average up from .218 to
.236. McInnis and Capt. Ratchford
still lead the list, the former with
the high mark of .400. With Proc-
tor, Goodson and Marks, all sophs,
hitting the old pill like they are,
the Wildcat nine should be among
the best in the state when it comes
to batting, within a season or two.
“Irish” McInnis can also be count-
ed on for more than his share of
hits as well as pitching the pill ov-
er in great form.

The V. M. I. track meet was lost, it
is true, but that didn’t prohibit the
breaking of three Davidson records.
“Sporty” Regen broke his own record
in the discus, having set a new David-
son mark of 123 feet and 5 inches in the
Clemson meet and bettering that by

Classy Twirler

C., Davidson Wildcat heaver. Kugler
was one of the mainstays of the Dav-
idson moundsmen, last season and has
been performing very effectively in the
box this year.

two and one-half inches against V. M.
I. Whittle also broke his record in
the 220-yard low hurdles; the old time
being 25.4 seconds and his new mark
25 records. The third record broken
was the Pole Vault. Capt. Bailey set
a new high mark of 11 feet and 3
inches, beating the old one by three
inches,

That seventh inning is still fail-
ing to function in favor of David-
son. It was in this frame of the
Duke game that the Blue Devils
tied the score and paved the way
for a win. This defeat is the second
for the Cats from a big five team,
Carolina having downde them ear-
ly in the season. The win over
State, however, makes the final
count in the big five series one win
for Davidson and two losses. Kug-
ler pitched fine ball against the
Duke nine but they succeeded in
bunching their hits to gain a vic-
tory. “Sleepy” Goodson was very
much awaké at the bat in this con-
test, getting two hits out of four
trips up.

The fresh trackmen succeeded in
chalking up two wins in four days.
The first was an easy victory but it
took the final event in the latter, with
Campbell College, to determine vic-
tory. In this event, the mile-run, the
Kittens took all three places to nose
out the rivals by two points. Bill Wil-
lard continues to hurl the javelin in
great style, heaving it in the Campbell
meet for a record-breaking mark of
77 feet and 3 inches. This betters Da-
vidson’s old record by nine feet and
seven inches.

‘TAKING CHANCES.

While traveling you can watch your

baggage—some of the time. While
your effects are away from home being
aundered, pressed, repaired, etc., you
cannot watch them.

When losses occur! save annoyance
and delay in recovering therefor by
having Personal Effects insurance. We
should appreciate an opportunity to ex:
plain this protection.

It’s safer to have insuranec—
and not need it!

STATE DEFEATED
BY WILDCAT NINE

Marrow Allows Only Seven Hits
to Win Game

In a game full of errors, the Wildcats
supported the pitching of Marrow to
down. the N. C, State nine 7-3. The Wollf-
pack held a 3-2 lead until the eighth
inning when Davidson scored three runs,
adding two more in the ninth for a total
of seven.

This was the only win the 'Cats were
able to. chalk up among the “big five”
teams, being defeated by Duke and Caro-
lina in previous games. Captain Allgood
pitched good ball for State, but failed
to receive adequate support
mates.
McInnis,

from his

Proctor and Ratchford were
best at the bat for Davidson, getting two
hits each.
