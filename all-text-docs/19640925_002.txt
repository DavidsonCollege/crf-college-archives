If there is a choice between a crackpot and a crook,

1 will take the crook.

—Anonymous freshman, Sept. 22, 1964

Usually when asked to break
down the Davidson student body poli-
tically. we respond: “About 20 per-
cent are conservative: another 20 per-
cent are liberal; while the remaining
60 percent are apathetic.” The poll
conducted by THE DAVIDSONIAN
Tuesday helped dispel some of our
feelings about the apathetic Davidson
student: on some issues at least He is
willing to take a stand.

Students numbering 702—a rec-
ord participation—voted in the poll.
We are hopeful that their motivation
is a sustained interest in the events
of our day rather than the frenzy of

a Presidential campaign.
® s s

And this “frenzy of a Presidential
campaign?” In it we can find little but
disappointment. The Goldwater-John-
son race is, -in effect, anticlimactic to
the drive for the Republican nomina-
tion.

In our idealism we looked for-
ward to a great liberal-conservative
dialogue. In our moments of practical-
ity we realize that a liberal-conserva-
tive dialogue would get neither candi-
date more than a few votes.

Hence, the Republican camp has
blasted away at anything and every-
‘thing vaguely associated with De-
mocrats. We hear references to wheel-
ing-dealing by the incumbent, loud

whispers of scandal in high places.
Meanwhile. the Democratic camp
mouths glib phrases about “peace.”
prosperity." and “progress.” while
charges of “extremist” and “push-
button happy” cloud a smog-filled sky.

In our idealism we wonder wheth-
er the issues are valid. But again turn-
ing to our moments of practicality, we
find it useless to wonder. Political ex-
pediency. Yes, political expediency
until one can take no more but there
is still more.

Gone is the rational statement
and the well-reasoned position. Our’s
is the “Glib Age.” Into the higher
political echelons go the talented writ-
ers, the masters of the “glib phrase.”
No longer do we hear: “Does it make
sense?” The answer is obvious. The
criterion is “Does it sound good?”

And in a melancholy resignation,
we ask the inevitable: “Why?” You
evade the answer. You tell yourself
about the power of advertising—of
selling—when the subject matter is
kept simple. Cardinal rule: don’t get
too involved: don’t go into great de-
tail; don’t go over their...

But “Why?” is still staring you in
the face. Reluctantly you give in and
answer with a question.

‘Ever discuss politics with Ameri-
ca in a barber shop on Saturday morn-
ing?

Browsing...

We understand that in the Self-
Study program last year. the profes-
sors were asked to list all books and
periodicals which were needed. to
bring the Library up to what they
considered essential in their depart-
ments. No limit was put on. the num-
ber or expense of books and periodi-
tals that should be listed.

Many of them did a thorough job
of self-study and came up with impos-
ing lists of needs. Then the President
went out and raised about $40,000—
over and above the regular library
budget—to make the purchases.

Every department got what it
had requested with the exception of
the History Department, which had
asked for twice.as much as any other
department (they have some “eager-
beavers” in the department). So if
the Library isn’t nearly up to what it
ought to be, the Administration ap-
parently is not to blame. Certainly
the needs will continue to grow as
the College grows. But we have con-

fidence that these needs will be met.
s s e

One small request from THE
DAVIDSONIAN: Since the Librarv is
already open “for reading and reflec-
tion” on Sunday afternoons, couldn’t
we open again for a few hours after
Vespers? We aren’t asking for “‘com-
petition” with Vespers, just a place to
go where it is quiet and conductive to
“reading and reflection” after church
is out.

Directory Directions. ..

THE DAVIDSONIAN is pleased to
bring out the annual student directory
one week earlier than in past years.
But this newspaper is also hopeful
that this is the last year that it has
such a task.

Needed is a bound student direc-
tory, a directory with considerably
more information than names and
room nubers. Davidson’s Alpha Phi
Omega (APO), national service frater-
nity, has published such a directory
for the last two years, but distribution
has been delayed until! late autumn.

Ads could be gathered in the
spring. Information on upper-class-
men could be set during the summer.
And no later than a week after Pledge
aSturday. a complete directory could
be available. Certainly, APO should
agree to move its schedule up, or the

An Autumn Walk...

“The 80-acre campus of the col-
lege. shaded by elms, maples and
century-old oaks, has an atmosphere
of informality and calm. The ante-
bellum buildings of the original quad-
rangle, with their white columns and
red brick. suggest the era of southern
neo-classicism in which they were con-
structed. The newer buildings,
thoroughly modern throughout, pre-
serve the tie with tradition by an ad-
herence in their exteriors to Classical
Revival forms.”

Beanie Boy Time Again:

Home Mores In ‘Cat Den

By BRUCE GREGORY

Davidsonian Feature Writer

This year’s freshman class presents another example of Davidson’s ability to
attract the top-quality student with a well- rounded background.

All statistics indicate that

verbal scores and 1060 math

But college board scores and

the class has a record to be scores of applicants above 600. rank don't form the only in-

proud of, even in comparison ~
with the upperclassmen. Much
will be expected from this new
group of Davidson geftlemen,

Those high-school seniors
who sent in their college board
scores numbered 2590. The
average verbal score was 527.
while the average math seore
was 573. The figures for the
year before are almost iden-
tical with the exception of 470
more applicants for this vear.

A closer analysis reveais
some interesting progress. Us-
ing 600 as a cut-off point. the
number of applicants this year
who had this score or above
for the 1962-63 class was 423
verbal score and 790 math
score,

For 1963-64 there were 510
verbal seores and 850 math
scores of applicants above the
600 cut-off point. But for this

year’s class there were 620

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

age college board scores were
verbal, 607; and math, 658. The
box on this article compares
performances of previous class-
es.

These figures show a 45%
increase in high verbal scores
and a 34% increase in high
math scores over the two-year
period.

This year’s freshmen ranked
high in their high school stand-
ings. Seventy-three per cent
ranked in the upper 10°o. fif-
teen per cent. ranked in the
second 10%. and twelve per
cent ranked below the second
10%.

And due to the varied con-
siderations for admission, the
college accepted only 60% of
those applicants who ranked in
the top 10%.

which the freshmen class made.

Thirty-three advance place-
ment exams were submitted and
twenty-two of these received
full credit in history, English,
math and/or French.

Almost 10% of the class
served either as presidents of
the student bodies or student
councils, 4% were annual edi-
tors, and 7.5% were news-
paper editors. Nearly 20% serv-
ed as captain of at least one
major athletic team.

It can ve easily seen tnat
the new freshman class has
a great potential, but none of
them can afford to rest secure
on past laurels. As Dr. Martin
put it. “Of you, much will be
expected.”

FROM THE BACK OF THE BUS

Schalfly ‘Echo’ Broadside

zy ‘Bares Black G.0.P. Past'

By CHARLES RAMBERG
Davidsonian Associate Editor

As we watched the Goldwater steamroller grind on
to victory at the Republican convention this past sum-
mer, we had no idea that we were also witnessing a great
moral revolution within the G. O. P.

In A Choice Not An Echo, Phyllis Schlafly’s purpose
is to give Senator Goldwater an aura of godliness, but in
her hatchet work on Barry's innumerable enemies, she
has also bludgeoned the Republican Party.

The story is exciting, reminding us of the shoot-
’em-up cowboy flicks that the Old West have given us,
It pits the good guys (the Goldwater Gang) against the
bad guys (masked bandits known only as “the Eastern
Kingmakers’’).

It seems that, beginning with the 1940 G. O. P. con-
tion that nominated Wendell Willkie, these bad guys
named every Republican presidential nominee until this
year, when the Goldwater Gang stopped them cold.

According to Phyllis Schlafly, these kingmaker candi-
dates have invariably been pawns, unwilling to fight the
issues that will appeal to bedrock Republicans. In the
opinion of the author, the most effective issue has usual-
ly been Communism, foreign and domestic.

The kingmakers are identified as a group of power-
ful New York financial leaders who have a vested in-
terest in continuation of deficit spending by the U. S.
government and in continuation of foreign aid programs.
For those readers who may be unable to perceive the pur-

ose of foreign aid, Mrs. Schlafly reminds them bat
oreign “giveaway” programs are an integral part of the
“America Last foretgn policy dictated by the kingmak-
ers...” ;

The kingmakers’ most heinous crime has been that
by “using hidden persuaders and psychological warfare
techniques, (they) manipulated the Republican National
Convention to nominate (kingmaker) candidates .. .”
This charge is used to blame these mysterious eastern
bandits for all the behind-the-schemes machinations that
go on at any political convention.

Following this broadside at the kingmakers, Mrs.
Schlafly describes how the 1940 Willkie nomination was
“bought” with kingmaker dollars. She believes that the
kingmaker scheming led the delegates to pick Willkie
instead of a man whom they knew in their hearts to be
right.

After reading this, we wonder less about the ethics
of the kingmakers than about the intelligence and re-
sponsibility of those Republican delegates who have been
so often and so easily swayed.

It is in this light that the nomination of Barry Gold-
water must be seen as evidence of a moral revolution
within the G. O. P. Phyllis Schlafly assures. us that the
kingmakers were at work in the Cow Palace last July.
But this time the Republican delegates voted their hearts.
if not their heads, and nominated Barry Goldwater.

___ Now the bad guys are rotting in their graves on Boot
Hill, while the rest of us wonder how much closer to our
graves we'll get if Goldwater somehow wins.

* s 2

This G. O. P. moral revolution aside, Mrs. Schiafly’s
book is mostly just plain revolting.

Her prose is laced with many statements that merit
reading and provoke laughter.

For example, she tells us that “Failing to file any
income tax return is a favorite failing of Democrat lib-
erals.” She cites two Democrat tax-evaders to back up
her preposterous charge.

For another sample, “The Soviet empire would die
of its own economic anemia if Democratic Administra-
tions didn’t keep giving it massive blood transfusions,
such as the sending of 64 million bushels of American
wheat.”

We may have real cause to fear the Russians if they
can turn 64 million bushels (about five per cent of the
annual U. S. output) into a “massive transfusion.”

Last of all, there is the defense of simple solutions
for great problems. Terming sophisticated solutions for
complex national problems a ‘‘Rube Goldberg approach,”
Mrs. Schiafly mentions the sewing machine and the air-
plane as the sort of simple solutions she favors.

“Finally, there is a very simple solution to what to
do about the whole ‘looney’ mess in Washington today—
elect Barry Goldwater, the man with the courage to give
us simple solutions.”

We have nothing to ada.

Prexies Laud NSA: ‘Good Step Forward’

Will Jackson and I were the Davidson College delegates to the

By FRED SACKETT
President, Senior Class

National Student Association National Conferences in Minneapolis. Minn.

this past August 12-16. This is the annual convention of the NSA, where workshops are held, and the policy for the following year for the Nation-

al Office is legislated.

Will attended the President's
Conference, while I attended
the NSA Coordinator's Coa-
ference. These conferences
serve not only as workshops,
but to a great degree set up
the agenda of the Congress it-
self. °

To a surprising degree, the
Conference steered away from
“political issues,” and concen-
trated more than it ever had
before on practical problems
of student governments. Even
in a year when “liberal” or-
ganizations are hard pressed by
the conservative issues in this
election campaign, the growth
of a stronger group of schools
reflecting a “moderate” trend
was evident.

The conferences dealt with
such questions as: NGA in re-
lation to other campus organiza-
tions; NSA speakers program;
the role of the student council;
the co-ordination of campus
organizations; direct benefits
to students; and problems fac-
ed by expanding student de-
mands.

Some of these topics are
wider in implication than the
title leads one to think. For
example. I feel we gained a
great deal of valuable informa-
tion on what NSA can do for
students directly.

NSA has realized that too
often the students of member
schools do not see the bene-
fits of membership to NSA as
plainty as do the Student
Governments. In this respect,
it has undertaken to make
known the benefits which it
can offer directly to the stud-
ents through the Student Coun-
cil.

One idea which we felt would
be of value ts that of a student
discount card. Other member
schools have had great success
in printing a card carrying the
names of certain merchants in
different businesses who guar-
antee a discount of a certain
percentage to students. This
card would be obtainable at a
smali fee, which would imple-
ment the member school's bud-
get. By the publicity given, and
the probable increase in trade
by greater student buying, the
merchant could see the value
of giving discounts. The card
would probably carry such
items as: three or four restau-
rants, three or four men’s
shops, certain trading stores in
students’ supplies, and perhaps
even movies and other enter-
tainment. This would go much
further than just the student
identity card, and in joint ef-
fort with Queens, would give

students of both schools a ‘signi-
ficant saving in money.

Other ideas which can be
brought out at this time are
the possibilities of charter
flights to Florida and Nassau
during Spring break. NSA al-
ready operates these flights at
less than half price of regular
fare. By arranging a stop in
Charlotte of these flights, our
students could join the migra-
tion of “sun seekers,” at luxury
travel speeds and economical
rates. In the area of publica-
tions, the list of material which
would be valuable to other
campus organizations, such as
the Honor Court, Student
Union, Interfraternity Council,
fraternities, or the honoraries
is a quite impressive one.

But I feel that the greatest
fault found in NSA by the
Davidson students was the
“liberal political overtone” of
the organization. I will not say
that this has been solved com:
pletely by any means, BUT
THE GROWING ROLE OF
“MODERATES” IS QUITE EVI.
DENT. The Columbia Resolu-
tion, calling for no political
activity, and supported by the
Carolinas-Virginia Region, was
defeated by less than 40 votes
during the Plenary Sessions.
A resolution introduced to re-

state that NSA should take IN THEIR ROLE AS STUD-

strong political stands on any
issue, WAS DEFEATED BY
60 VOTES.

A resolution titled. “Toward
A More Effective and Repres-
entative USNSA,” which states
“The USNSA National Student
Conference shall take position
on moral, political, or social
issues only when they have
a direct causal bearing on stud-
ents in their educational milieu,
that is, by virtue of their be.
ing enrolled in college and
universities,” passed by the Na-
tional Committee by a vote of
2 to 1. This was backed heavily
by most of the schools of our
region.

The Carolinas-Virginia re-
gion was very active at the
Conference and at the Congress.
We succeeded in getting Mike
Lawler, past Student Body
Hill, elected vice-president of
President of UNC at Chapel
NSA. The region introduced
legislation pushing for elect-
ed NSA delegates at any school
with over two delegates. ALSO,
a reaffirmation for the David-
son resolution passed at the
last Regional Conference, PRO-
HIBITIN POLITICAL RESOLU-
TIONS ON A _ REGIONAL
LEVEL WHICH DO NOT
DIRECILY AFFECT STUDENT

ENTS. was made very clear to
the schools of this region.

While NSA is still not the
ideal organization that I feel
Davidson would want it to be.
THE PROGRESS THAT HAS
BEEN MADE IS ENCOURAG-
ING. The narrow defeat of the
Columbia resolution, the defeat
of the ‘Political Activity” re-
solution, and the Committee
passage of the “More Effec-
tive NSA" resolution, all show
signs of the changing role and
policy of USNSA. With the re-
gion represented on the Na-
tional Executive Committee by
Mike Lawler, and with the re-
affirmation of the regional re-
solution by Davidson, ! feel
that a good step forward has
been made.

I feel that our continued
association with USNSA_ will
Prove a valuable and increas-
ingly significant part of our
student government here at
Davidson. With an active role
being played by Davidson, es-
pecially on the regional level.
T don’t think that students will
need to question the value of
NSA at Davidson again for a
long ime.
