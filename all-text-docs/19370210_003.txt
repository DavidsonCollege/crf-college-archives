DESCRIBES OXFORD DAY

Studies in Medical Department
Of Oxford

(This is the first in a series of ar-
ticles written especially for The Dav
idsonian by Carleton Chapman, Rhodes
Scholar and Davidson graduate of the
class of '36)

The kind invitation of the
editor of the Davidsonian has
been very often in my mind,
but has had to wait for fulfil-
ment till now because the so-
called “Oxford system” has a
way of gobbling up every sec-
ond of one’s time, a fact that
Drs. Vowles, Cumming, and
Mr. Lilly will substantiate in
full.

Oxford, A Revelation

Oxford England have been
a sort of revelation for me in more

and

ways than one. In the first place,
I didn’t dream that
yatch to learn about the working of

there was so
these bodies of ours, and, as I am
constantly reminded on all sides, “I
ain't seen nuthin’ yet.” Furthermore,

sun actually shine here as
much as it did at Davidson, though
I must admit with less brilliance.
One reputation to which England
lives up to in full, however, is her
amazingly consistent capacity for
making terrible coffee.

In Davidson's Library are doubt-
less more than a few books which
give, in a more readable st¥le than
I can command, an account of the
life of an Oxford student. However,
to the best of my knowledge, there
is no book in print which gives an
adequate account of the life of a
student at Oxford, for
which reason I venture to write
down a day’s routine at Oxford.

Annoying Rule

To begin with, there is in most
colleges at Oxford a very annoying
rule to the effect that each stu-
dent has to attend roll-call or cha-
pel a cértain number of mornings
“a week at the unheard of hour of
seven-fifty. In England, eight
o'clock in the morning seems more
to me as five o'clock seemed at
home. Accordingly, the chapel bell,
strangely like the Chambers Build-
ing bell in sound, gets me up each
morning for roll call or chapel. I
usually plod through two quadran-
gles to the baths, after attending
roll call, and dash back, after a Not
bath, to dress before my own tiny
fireplace. My scout, a blustery old
Welshman, brings in my breakfast
promptl¥ at eight-thirty.

Four mornings a week I have to
gulp it down in great haste and racé
on my bicycle to the science build-
ing for nine o’clogk lectures. The
rest of the morning is usually spent
in the dissecting rooms. At one,
I go back to-my rooms for a lunch
of bread, cheese and—milk.

Full Afternoons

The afternoon is passed either in

the dissecting rooms again, or in the

histology laboratories. For every
afternoon to be occupied is’ ex-
tremely unusual at Oxford. Most

students have the afternoon entire-
ly free for sports. As a rule, I
make it a point to get away in time
for a lively game of squash or a few
turns-around-the-track-before tea-
time. The custom of tea in the af-
ternoon is not altogether foreign to
me, since for my first two years at
Davidson I was a loyal occupant of
Watts dormitory. I might add that
in England, I believe even the most
staunch supporter of Georgia dormi-
tory would accept the custom of
afternoon tea with the ~ greatest
pleasure. To me, it is the best of
four daily meals, and affords a very
welcome rest period in the rush of
the ordinary day’s work.

Jan Garber, now known as

recognized as one of the best

by order of the government.
When he enlisted in thé war he
was ordered to form an orches-

training camps.

It is also strange to note that if
he had not received a broken nose

Herbert Marshall says: .

‘...a light smoke is a joy
to the throat”

€

fot

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, 87% stated they personally
prefer a light smoke.

Mr. Marshall verifies the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the radio,
stage, screen, and opera. Their voices are their
fortunes. That’s why so many of them smoke
Luckies. You, too, can have the throat protection
of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain harsh
irritants removed by the exclusive process “It’s
Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat!

A Light Smoke

-
, —

“Before I came over to this country
an English cigarette appealed to
me because it was firmly packed.
In America I tried various popu-
lar brands looking for the same
virtue. Lucky Strike led all the rest.
And what’s more—I soon discovered
that Luckies were a light smoke
and a positive joy to the throat.”
