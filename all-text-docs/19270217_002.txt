games in six days, winning one and losing
three.

The first game was with Oak Ridge, in
the western part of «the state. This game
was dropped by the score of 46-25. The
game was close at times, but the Fresh lacked
the extra punch necessary to win. Pritchett
was high point man for Davidson, with 11
points, and Pierce led for Oak Ridge with

Baseball Season Opens

Of Call in Issue for
| Pitchers and Catchers

Captain Woodham Conducts Initial
Work-Out of Year—others
Out Soon

The crack of the baseball bat will soon be

| heard coming from the direction of Richard- |

|son Field. Then Coach Monk will have his
{diamond stars out and another season will
| be under way,

The call for pitchers and catchers was is-
| sued Monday morning, and they began pre-
| liminary warming up that afternoon. Regu-
| lar practice will start just as soon as the
| weather permits.

The Wildcats’ chance of success on the
| diamond this yéar is very good indeed. From
| last season we have the following letter men:
| Woodham, Wells, Dulin, Glenn, Kugler,
Davis, and Johnson. All of these men have
shown up well in the past. “Others from
last year’s Fresh squad, and those who have
‘been out beforé, who stand a good chance
| for the team are: Ratchford, Ramsey, Craw-

E. W., on the varsity squad the last part of the 1926 | ford, Meadows, Murray, Oden, Poole, Black,

| McGeachy, Covington, R. and “Lefty” Hamp-
|ton. With this material to start with, the
| Wildcats ought to find their way to the top.
| Manager Barnhardt is arranging a stiff
schedule for the nine, and it has not been
|completed quite as yet. However, several
| good trips have been definitely settled upon.
| The first and probably the hardest of the
trips will be to Atlanta, during which time
Wofford, Furman and Clemson will be met,
then two games with Oglethorpe, in Atlanta.
| These games will be played during April
| 7-12,
April 27-29 will find the Wildcats touring
heek own state; and meeting Elon, State, and
| Carolina, on their own diamonds.

The season will be opened this year as
usual by two games wth Oak Ridge. The
/annual Easter Monday game with Carolina
|

one of the best played games of the trip probably have gone down in defeat, Time | Will again be played at Salisbury.

Davidson Golfers

Chosen This Week

The Davidson College golf team will be
| chosen in the next few days, from a score or
more of strong contenders. The ones turn-
ing in the best scores for the past week are:
' Steve McGill, 71; Billy Wolf, 74; English
Love, 76; Arthur Mills, 77; along with a
host of other golfers. There are others who
deserve merit for their consistent work and
their golf ability. Johnny Foster, Sloppy
Lingle, Mason Carroll, and Hamp Jennings,
are prospective members for the team. A
| splendid spirit along with beautiful weather
has put everyone in good spirits and the in-
dications are that we will have a team worthy
ito represent this institution.

The players have been going strong all
| season, having defeated Statesville and Con-
cord in the past fall. The plans for the
spring season are much more elaborate and
|are composed of several inter-collegiate
| matches. Matches have been arranged with
Concord and Statesville again this spring.
Matches are being negotiated with both
Georgia Tech and the University of Alabama
and the indications are that these matches
will -be played over the Charlotte Country
Club's course. Salisbury will probably be
added to the schedule for this spring.

There will be a tournament conducted in
the near future to select the best golf player
on-the Hill, All-men- interested in -golf- are
urged to give their names to Steve McGill
this week so that a list can be made.
