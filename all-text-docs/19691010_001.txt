Fiery Sophomore Rally
Denounces Area kxams

Approximately 200 sopho-
mores have signed a letter
of concern pertaining to area
exams which was presented
at.a meeting of the class in
Love auditorium Tuesday
night.

The letter was drafted by
a committee of eight sopho
mores who had met with
some faculty members on
the subject.

Sophomore Class Presi
dent Todd Hobbie termed
the resolution ‘‘conserva-
tive’’ but Said that the group
did not wish to antagonize
those faculty members with
demands whilé there was
still a climate conducive to
change.

Howard Ramagli blasted
the statement as useless be-
Cause it contained no defi-
nite course of action. He
mentioned that many mem-
bers of the class were al-
ready starting transfer pro-
cedures.

*At the request of Jody
Turner, a hand count was
taken which revealed that 90
per cent of the 160 attending

the meeting had investigat-

ed the transferring as an op-
tion to area exams.

the resolution, most class

the faculty area exams,
the faculty is interested in
making changes in the form

Davidson College's future

months. That comprehensive
$41,000 study being done by
the Academy for Education-

* al Develonment (AED) is al-

ready a month late and is
not expected until the first
of November.

Because of the delay, the
trustees will hold a special
meeting in January to con
sider AED’s recommenda-
tions.

President Samuel R.
Spencer said the delay is
due to problems in bringing
AED’s panel ‘‘to the scene.”
He expressed no great con-
cern over the delay, explain
ing that the panel members
are important men with full
schedules.

Although admitting that
the $41,000 fee seems exces

According to Hobbie, 15
schools have suspended class

es for the Moratorium, with
Davidson being the only
school in the Southeast

(south of Pennsylvania and
east of California) to do so.
A number of schools, how-
ever, have endorsed the
moratorium on “business as
usual,” without formal. sus-
pension of activities,

It is the actual suspension
which was aroused the feel
ings of a number of students
at Davidson.

Robert Bryan, a senior rep
resenting the campus Young
Americans for Freedom, na-
tionally a conservative organ
ization, called, the faculty
action “repulsive and taw
dry.”

Although he said that no
legal action is being planned
to secure class meetings,
he said that the faculty action
represented a violation of his
rights of free speech, adding
that since he can not attend
class he is made a part of
“the protest.”
