The baseball team
floated down to
Wofford College
last Tuesday and
Wednesday, to play
two games with the
above-mentioned in-
stitution. They man-
aged to get them
both played between
floods. The Wild-
cats took the opener,
a seven inning af-
fair, by a very un-
comfortable margin
of 7 to 6.

Of course I am
_ prejudiced, but I
think that we were
cheated out of a
victory in thessecond game. Here are my reasons: With
two out in the ninth inning and Davidson ahead 5 to 2,
the umpire (censored) called a Wofford player safe on a
play at second. The player had slid beyond the bag as he
slid in, he knocked Brooks (that’s me) down. As the
two players rolled in the mud, Brooks lightly tapped the
Wofford man on the head three times (count ’em) with
the ball. But of course the umpire (Wofford, class of
’44) didn’t (or refused) to see the play, and called’the man
safe.

A slight argument followed, with Herion and Keésler
kicking up the most fuss. Keesler came charging in from
right field with murder in his eye, and the umpire seeing
him coming, walked (rather quickly) off of the field.
Keesler yells, ‘“You’ll not get away with that, bub,’ which
was the signal that touched the spark to the team’s ire.

The umpire finally talked Keesler, Brooks and Herion
into letting him come back on the field and play was re-
sumed. I hate to say this, but Wofford went ahead to win.

The team acquired new baseball caps while they were
in Spartanburg. They must have brought the team good
luck because we won a game and Brother, that is a rare
occurence. Mr. S has decided to order the high school some
similar to ours so they must be O.K. (Any similarity be-
tween that last statement and a dirty crack is purely in-
tentional).

I guess you are all wondering why I am writing this
column instead of Keesler. (I am taking it for granted
that you have read this far). Well, it’s a long story, but
1’ tell you. Keesler and I went out to Converse (1 went
along to drive. Ask Pete Whittle), and it seems that
Keesler sort of , (Wasn't so long
after all, was it?) However, the doc says that he'll be up
and around any day now. I didn’t get the girl’s name but
I will try and get it on the next trip. (That is, if we take
another trip).

Coach Sheppard has been trying vainly to schedule
some more games for the baseball team, but nobody seems
to want to play us. You don’t suppose they could be afraid
of us, do you? (No, I guess you are right ) The University
of South Carolina and Oak Ridge are potential opponents,
but nothing is definite as yet.

The team as a whole-is slightly better than: was last
year’s aggregation, but is still rather weak on hitting and
in some of the fielding spots. However, with a little more
experience, the team should turn in some wins. Even
Whittier’s knuckle-ball is breaking right. (1 taught him
how to throw it).

The D club initiation for members of the rifle team
who won letters, was held on last Wednesday night at
Mooresville and various other places (It’s a Military
secret in case the student council is interested). There
were no casualties to speak of, and a fine? time was had
by everyone.

rights for none”. Jefferson believed
that the liberty of the individual is
the index to moral ‘progress, and
that “the prerequisite of freedom

policy of agrarianism is well-known.

America today, with its strong

| Whittier Wins

Opener by 7-6

On last Wednesday and Tues-
day, the baseball team visited Spart-
anburg, S. C*for a two-game series
with Wofford College. Two exciting
ninth innings resulted; the cats
winning the first 7 to 6. and losing
the second 6 to 5. Both games were
played on a muddy diamond, with
intermittent April showers discour-
aging’ a large attendance.

Phil Whittier pitched the opener,
and did very well until the ninth
inning. when he tired and loaded
the bases. with one out. At. this
point. Carol Herion relieved him,
and after a brief flurry of wildness,
settled down and retired the side
leaving the winning run stranded at
second,

Davidson had a big fourth inning
with two doubles by Coble and Ber-
ry respectively, but the fifth was
the main inning for the Cats. In it,
Berry starred again, with a hard
grounder through short stop which
cleared the sacks and brought in
four runs. This sewed up the game

for Davidson.
