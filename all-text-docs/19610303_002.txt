A Shift Of Emphasis

Hugh Cannon, °53, ex-Rhodes
Scholar, raised a little stink here last
Tuesday. The stink had some people
reaching for deodorant that couldn't
quite clear the smell away.

in his calm, concise, penetrating
manner, Cannon said that Davidson
education is a little sick, and to be
perfectly frank about it, it’s going to
take a good bit of money to make it
well.

Cannon summed up what THE
DAVIDSONIAN said a month ago
about poor professors, but he added
the reason: Davidson cannot bid high
enough in the open market.

He pointed out that, Davidson
likes to compare herself with the
likes of Williams, Amherst, Oberlin
and Swarthmore — but Davidson can-
not compare with these schools in the
amount she pays her faculty.

It is true that faculty pay here
has increased about 25 percent in the
last four years. It is also true that in
this area Davidson ranks close to the
best liberal arts colleges in the South.
But how many really outstanding lib-
eral arts schools are there in the
South? And how many mediocre
schools are there to pull down the
average?

We've not heard Davidson offi
cials lately say that they hope we can
be as good as Elon, Catawba or Lenoir
Rhyne. ;

For really fine teachers, David-
son must compete not only with the

“best liberal arts colleges in the

South,” but with the state-supported ,
schools and a few of the best liberal

arts schools in the East. It’s a rough

game and we often end up near the

bottom of the pile. Dean of Faculty

Frontis W. Johnston admitted to Hugh

Cannon, “If I could offer $1000 more,

it would help.”

The need applies not only to se-
curing the best men, but to getting
more men. The one-man department
is still a nemesis to liberal arts edu-
cation.

If we admit the need for more
money for teachers, we must face
the problem of where to get it. Can-
non suggested that we had put too
much into buildings. The trouble is,
the buildings are there — it’s too late
to tear them down and we can’t sell
them.

But Cannon had a point. David-
son has perhaps put too much empha-
sis on the physical plant.

We do not accuse the administra-
tion of sloughing off in the area of hir-
ing good teachers just because there
has been a concentrated building pro-
gram in progress.

We do feel, however, that it is
high time to shift the emphasis. It is
time to put the teaching end of edu-
cation in the forefront. No more build-
ings are being planned at present —
we don’t need any more. But we do
need better teachers and more teach-
ers.

On Campus Reaction

An election season always invites
journalistic comments and observa-
tions. Failing either to rise above
the situation or to subdue our journ-
alistic instincts, we venture into the
dangerous ground of political com-

mentary.

Tradition calls for a year of re-
action! Imaginative Dan LaFar gave
way to well-intentioned Ross Smyth,
hard-working John Kuykendall step-
ped out in favor of ineffectual Dee
Green, and productive Henry Shue
hands the reins to — well, that’s the
question.

By anyone’s standards, this has
been a successful year for the Stud-
ent Council. It has been a year of

rogress and change, but not of re-

bellious discontent. It has been a
quiet year, with the responsibilities
of leadership in capable student
hands.

We want some more of the same.

We do not contend that change
is inherently good. However, we do
maintain that one should follow the
path of ‘constant self-examination
with an eye toward possible improve-
ment. This year’s Student Council
gerves as an excellent case in point.

Through a mature approach of

thorough discussion and investigation,
the Council has produced and approv-
ed several important and sound pro-
posals. Through continuous self-ex-
amination, the Council was even
prompted to reverse its action on
three major issues, displaying the ma-
ture trait of recognizing its own mis-
takes and doing something about
em.

Nor do we believe that the vig-
orous crusader necessarily holds the
key to success. But we do feel that
vigorous leadership is essential for a
successful and productive student gov-
ernment.

We hope that the candidates —
not just in the race for student body
president, but in all the elections —
will approach all issues with maturity,
imagination and vigor. As with years
past, the coming year is full of many
possibilities. We only need the lead-
ers to point these possibilities out to
us.

And, as we hope for the best
from the candidates, we likewise hope
for the most through and most ma-
ture judgment of the student body in
its selection of officers for the com-

ing year.

A Gamble With The Council

Next Thursday the Student Body
will vote en the proposed revision of
the Student-Body Constitution. A
two-thirds vote is necessary to pass the
propesed constitution.

We favor its passage.

Article X is the key te the effec-
tiveness of the revised constitution.
It reads as follows: “The Student
Councit may adopt by a two-thirds
vote of the entire council such by-laws
as shall not be in conflict with this
constitution.”

Under the present constitution
it is necessary to obtain a two-thirds
affirmative vote by the student body
to adopt a new by-law. This rule
weakens the power of the Student
Council and unnecessarily delays,
even sometimes defeats, constructive
legislation.

We realize that Article X gives
the Student Council as much pewer

to pass bad legislation as good legis-
lation. But Student Couacil members
are better informed about the merits
of a proposed by-law and can vote
more intelligently than the average’
Davidson student.

We are willing to take the chance
that the Student Council will pass con-
structive legislation.

The Student Council has remov-
ed many of the details of the present

constitution and has made the propos-
ed constitution more flexible.

The body of the constitution has
been shortened and the articles gov-
erning the Freshman Advisor and the
Freshman Court have been placed in
the by-laws. These articles will be
under direct control of the council
and can now be immediately changed
by the council if they prove undesir-

able.

Reaction Year? .

“Won't Serve Them”

a

By RICK von UNWERTH

Davidsonian Steff Writer

Five businesses in Davidson which are often patronized by students have stated

To the question: “What
will you do if these Negro
students ask you for ser-
vice?” replies ranged from
“T'll ask them to leave” and
“Tl close that door and go
home,” to “Anybody that
feols with them is a damn
fool!”

All were not this vehe-
ment; some merely said, “I
hope they don’t try,” “No
comment,” or “I'll cross that
bridge when I come to it.”
But the implication was this:
For the most part, the Congo-
lese students will be treated
exactly the same as the Neg-
ro citizens of the town.

FOUR-YEAR STUDENTS

President D. G. Martin an-
nounced that the Congolesc
“will be regular four-year
students seeking a degree.”
He stated that the primary
objective in accepting stud-
ents from the Congo is to
“train leaders to return to
the people of Africa.”

Concerning the treatment
of the Negroes when they
come to Davidson, President
Martin said. “I would hepe
that the student body would
feel the same way as the ad-

ministration.” In the event
of any problems he felt that
if necessary the college
would take steps to make
their stay trouble-free.”
TOWN INTERVIEWS

The DAVIDSONIAN ques-
tioned several proprietors of
local business establishments
on their attitudes toward the
admission of these Negroes
to Davidson.

Hattie Morgan: said, “I'll
let them come in on the other
side (the grocery store) just
like the others. But,” she
stated emphatically, “rather
than have them in here, I'll
turn this side into a private
club, admitting white ‘mem-
bers’ only. If I opened it up
to them (Negro students) I'd
have ,to open it to the
others.”

BAD EFFECT

Hugo Sapp, owner of the
College Cut-Rate Drug, said
that “The effect on the local
Negroes will be bad,” and he
referred to the ‘integrated
conference held at Davidson
four summers ago, when
“both the Negroes and whites
of the town. distiked seeing
Negroes and whites having

LETTERS TO THE EDITORS

Careless Remark
Could Do Damage

Bear Editor:
While leaving the recent
smash hit at the College
Union “Intruder in the
Dust,” I overheard the fol-
lowing remark: “I guess this
means we all gotta go join
the (censored) Nigger picket
lines!”
| could not help think-
ing at the time about whet
effect this careless remark
about a movie not con-
cerned with an issue more
provocative than legal jus-
tice would have had if it
had chanced to fall upon
the ripe ears of one of our
prospective Congolese stud-
ents.
I propose that we ail take
a good Took at ourselves and
see if we are prepared to ac-
cept the responsible chal-
lenge of associating with
Congolese students. Remem-
ber, admitting students from
an impressionable country
whose people already are

torn by doubts about West-
ern feeling due to slander-
ous Russian propaganda cen-
eerning Lumumba’s recent
murder is a great deal more
dangerous than mere inte-
gration with U.S. Negroes
would have been.

The Congo is a country
ruled by Negroes, and its
people will scarcely be
able to tolerate or even
understand the humalie-
tion of being kept out of
eating places and insulted
by remarks perhaps not
even intended to be de-
rogatory.

There would not be this
dangey with “local” Negroes

whose pride has been ‘“‘con-
ditioned” so to speak, but
with Congolese students
here, it is impossible to
evaluate the damage done
to American-Congolese re-
lations by one careless com-
ment.

their refusal to serve any Negro Congolese students who come to Davidson. These
tradespeople stated unequivocally this week that they “‘won’t serve them.”

blanket parties together and
that sort of thing.

“The Negroes around here
won't have anything to do
with them,” he added.

WONT SEAT ‘EM

Mrs. Sapp said, “Most of
the Negroes are very nice
and we serve them over the
counter and let them move
out. But I don't. care if
they're from Timbuktu, we
won't seat them.”’ She felt
that “Any one who does is
asking for trouble. If you
let one in, you'll have to let
them all.”

She explained “I have a lot
of good friends in this town
that are Negroes, and there
are-many white people here
who would help them in any
way possible. But most Neg-
roes aren't ready for inte-
gration, and there’s no use in
lowering our standards.”

BARBERS’ POLICY

The policy of both of Dav-
idson's barber shops at pres-
ent is not to serve any Neg-
roes. Hood Norton, owner of
one of these shops, said
“Some of those boys (Negro
students) at that conference
tried to get in, but we would-
n’t serve them. The same
thing will happen next year.
I'll have to ask them to go
get their hair cut in Char-
lotte or somewhere.”

Norton asked, “If they
bring in forcign students,
why can’t they admit locally
educated colored people?” He
again stated that his shop
would continue its present
policy.

Ralph Johnson the owner
of Johnson’s Barber Shop,
believes that “the issue (in-
tegration) has grown out of
proper proportion. I don’t
think it should be that much
of a problem.”

Asked about what he would
do if one of the Congolese
students comes in for a hair-
cut Johnson replied, “I would
like to cooperate with the col-
lege, but I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.”

MOVE ON OUT

Mary Potts at the M&M So-
da Shep said “The fact that
they are Congolese wouldn't
make any difference. Tl
serve them at the counter,
just as I do the other now.
After they've been served
they can move on out, the
same as the others.

“If I seated them, it would
start others doing the same
thing.” Her partner, Murray
Fleming, expressed the same
feeling. ?

Janitor Remembers
Body-Snaching Past

By ERVIN DUGGAN

Preyer Infirmary—The antiseptic gloom, the pills,
the bed that’s too short, the endless temperature-taking
(with a shrill, “Your fever’s DOWN today, Mr. Doogan!):
they’re all a part of Davidson's deviously calculated pun-
ishment for being sick. |

But, like an angel who's stumbled accidently into
hell, there’s James, the infirmary janitor.

Late in the afternoon he comes in to sweep: humm- |
ing, pushing a rag mop, carrying a big white dustcloth.

You interrupt his singing with a question:

“How long have you worked here, James?”

“Bout fawty yeahs.” He pulls an enamelled pin from
his pocket, hands it to you.

He takes back the pin, resumes his sweeping for a
moment, then leans on his mop:

“Oh, dis place sho’ has changed. Puhfessuh Thies is
de onlies one lef' on de faculty dat was yeah when I
came on.”

He asks if it’s true, what he’s heard about Professor
Thies’ approaching marriage, grins broadly when you
tell him it’s true.

“Zat right? To de guess house lady? I ’clare.

James smiled a half-smile, remembering the old

days.

“You know, dey use to have a medical college downa—
de street; train boys to be doctuhs.”

He names a list of the old medical faculty: Dr. Mon-
roe, Dr. Skinner, Dr. Peters... ,

“Dem was hoss an’ buggy days. Lotsa times I he’p
’em hitch up, me an’ my daddy an’ de doctuh. Tuck longer
t’ git somewheah den, but dey got dere.”

He tells the story of a fraternity — “eithuh de
Betas or de Pi Kappa Phis” — which put a corpse in
one of the columns of Old Chambers; and he has a
story of a student caught at body-snatching.

“I know de boy dat did it. Good boy, too. His daddy
was a preachuh.

“I wukked in ol’ Watts ‘fo’ I come ovuh heah. One
time dis boy axed me if I knowed wheah dey was a pick
an’ shovel. I tol’ him wheah ¢’ git ’em, but I Widn’ he’p
him git ’em.

“Well, he went up to de cullud graveyahd —
you knows wheah de cullud graveyahd is — an’ got
de body. He dug up jus’ about half of dis new grave
an’ jus’ got de top paht of de bedy.

"Den he tuck it back to Watts an’ boiled it an’ boiled
it, an’ set de haid up een his winduh.

“One of mah fren's dat wukked ovuh at Miz Gaston’s
boadin’ house walked pas’ de dommito’y one day an’
say, ‘I ‘clare, James, dat look lak my daddy een dat
winduh.’

“So I went up in de boy's room an’ saw dem clothes
all caked wid mud, an’ dat pick, an’ I says, ‘Well, less us
go to de graveyahd an’ see if da’s yo’ daddy.’ ”

“We went ovuh dere, an’ sho’ ’nuff, his daddy was
gone.” | ,
What did the college do to the body-snatcher?

“Dey ship de boy. Dey ship him an’ chahge him five
hunnud dollahs fuh damages. His daddy come up befo’
de faculty an’ explain. Dat boy was gonna be a doctuh.

oor.

YMCA PRESIDENT REPORTS

‘Y’ Cabinet Adopts
‘Rights’ Resolution

By JIMMY RICHARDSON

In its fegular meeting of February 7, 1961, the cab-
inet of the Davidson College YMCA adopted unanimous- :
ly with one abstention a resolution to the effect that we,
as a cabinet, “express agreement with the object of
achieving equal rights, in all relationships of life and
with the use of the peaceful, non-violent technique for
achieving the objective.”

In other words, we stated
that we appreciate and un-
derstand the student view-
point that existing social con-
ditions require effective pro-
test such as “sit-ins,” picket-
ing, and boycotts. ¢

MORAL SUPPORT

‘What does this action mean
to the student body of David-
son College? It means that
the YMCA Cabinet is giving
its moral support to the pro-

testing students everywhere
who are sincerely seeking
equal rights for all men re-
gardiess ef race or color.

The cabinet wants it clear-
ly understood that it is NOT
speaking for Davidson Col-
lege, the Davidson College
YMCA, the faculty the ad-
ministration or the student
body but only for the mem-
bers of the Davidson College
YMCA Cabinet.

NOT ENTIRE YMCA

This resolution has been
sent to all of the other YM-
YWCA organizations in the
Southern Region of the Na-
tional Student YM-YWCA. In
the resolution it was made
perfectly clear that this was
an action of THE CABINET
of our YMCA and not an ac-
tion of the entire YMCA of
our college.

The purpose in sending
the resolution to these other
Y’s was to show Negro and

SOONER OR LATER YOU
GET TIRED OF HAVING SO
MUCH COMPANY?

Vig Mg Si vee

White students across our
Southland that there are at
least 17 Davidson students
who are sincerely concerned
in the Negro’s fight for equal
rights and privileges.

The National Studert
Christian Federation has pro-
vided a “Legal Aid and Schol-
arship Fund” for the pur-
pose of financially aiding any
student who needs legal aid
as a result of seeking equal
rights for all persons.

VESPERS OFFERING

In order to provide the
Davidson student who wish-
es to do so an opportunity
to show his tangible con-
cern for these students, the
cabinet has decided that fhe
vespers offering this Sunday
evening, March 5 will go in
its entirety to the NSCF for
the above purpose.

Those who do not agree
with this view are perfectly
free not to partieipate in the
offering. Those who do agree
may make their financial con-
tribution in this manner.

PRIOR TO PICKETING

I think that it is important
that the student body note
that this action by the YMCA
Cabinet was tuken prior to
the movie picketing that has
occurred recently in Char-
lette; it has in no way grown
out of this action in Char-
lotte but preceded it.

The cabinet felt that the
unequal rights given to Neg-
roes demanded that_ as a
cabinet we voice our concern
and witness to the faith of
our individual consciences.
We do not judge the stand
that is taken by any other
person campus. We simply
pray we may be led to de
what we feel that we, as in-
dividuals, should do.
