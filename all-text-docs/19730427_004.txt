Off and Running

We are delighted with Dr. Earl MacCormac's ap-
pointment to and his acceptance of the position of
dean of the newly revamped Center for Honors Study.

MacCormac has expended much effort already.
and we hope he will continue to do more in the future.
to insure the center of good professors who are truly
interested in the Honors Center's success. and of a
program which will indeed fulfill its expectations and
goals.

If Tuesday night's performance at the Open End is
any indication — and we feel it is — of MacCormac’s
enthusiasm for the program. we feel that the new Cen-
ter will begin operation with an unlimited possibility
to become a viable force in motivating and educating
the Davidson student of unusual talents and goals.

We can only hope that students will show as much of
an interest as MacCormac and Vice President for
Academic Affairs John Bevan, who helped in
establishing the new Center, have.

For if the new Center is to be effective. its most
essential need is not good professors or ad-
ministrators. but motivated students.

We wish MacCormac and the new faculty the best of
luck. and hope that in three years they can make the
Center such that the faculty will see fit to legislate its
continued existence.

Welcome Surprise

The appointment of Rich Wilson as Assistant to the
President for next year comes as a welcome surprise.
Since he will often be called upon to represent the
president in student affairs, we are glad that Wilson
has a past record of intense interest in this area.
There is little doubt that he brings with him to this

position the awareness and sensitivity which it
demands.

There is an innate tendency for the Assistant to the
President to become a buffer between President
Spencer and the students. This is a situation which is
neither beneficial to the students nor to President
Spencer. We feel certain however, that Wilson will
keep the interests of the students prominent in his
mind and not succumb to this pitfall.

We would like to congratulate Duff Bruce for the ex-
cellent job that he has done this year and wish Rich
Wilson an equally successful year.

With A Little Help
From Our Friends

Having a small staff numbering less than 20 people.
we sometimes find it difficult to keep in touch with all
the news and things that are happening on campus.

Often things that might be of interest or of concern
to students do not get the coverage in the paper that
thev deserve. solely because we are not aware of
them.

Because of this. we would like to encourage anvone
that sees or hears of something of interest to report

it to us. If it is a news story. it will get the coverage it- -

merits.

More importantly. if it is a rumor that needs in-
vestigation, we are more than willing to expend the
effort necessary to get the questions answered. And
we are not afraid to print the answers. even in thev
may prove embarassing to certain individuals.

We would encourage more students to get involved.
for it is only with your help that we can do our job.

So if vou have something that is bugging vou or that
vou feel needs looking into. don't be afraid to get in
touch with anv member of the stal{!. or bring it to the
DAVIDSONIAN office in the upstairs Union.

CHANGING OF THE GUARD

Matchbook Hoax Dims Career
Of ’39 SGA President Spencer

It is a very telling criticism,
or at least a revealing insight,
to look at Davidson as it was 34
years back. With alumni
weekend and with feelings that
we are doing little of any value
today. we look at the past.

THE DAVIDSONIANSs of those
years were imaginative
mirrors of day to day life within
the walls. Back in 1939 people
felt and thought a bit dif-
ferently, you see.

The times were bad. 1939 held
the threat of war in Europe.
Hitler moved East. and the
Rhodes Scholarships to Oxford
were discontinued.

Popular topics in the school
newspaper were varied.
Someone reported a study at
California which proved that
kissing killed germs.

On the homefront, Davidson's
football team finished with one
victory in nine games. The
school revised its cut system
and Fred Waring wrote a new
school alma mater.

Around here, Shaw Smith was
becoming famous for his un-
canny resemblance to Groucho
Marx. He was a student then, as
was Locke White who oc-
casionally wrote a few things
for the DAVIDSONIAN.

Charlie Parker and Heath
Whittle were young coaches.
And a Professor named Kim-
brough gave an exhibition of his
money.

But the school. then as now
revolved around its students
— Freshmen were disciplined
for such offences as failing to
wear beanies.

In moments of levity. thev
watched such movies as “The
Wizard of Oz” and “The Return
of the Cisco Kid.”

One weekend entertainer was
Joe Ross, who played the fiddle
with his ankles locked behind
his head.

The paper referred glowingly
to the “three jolly coeds‘ on
campus. Students were
nicknamed ‘Great Scoot.”’
‘Black Dog” and *‘Mad Monk.”

Back then your basic stuffed
shirt sold for two dollars at
Belk’s in Charlotte. and ves.
Chalmers Davidson was direc-
tor of the library. ;

In 1939 the DAVIDSONIAN
reported a lot of advice anda lot
of just plain gossip. On April 12.
the paper cited surveys
revealing that snakes were a

coed's greatest fear. Bulls, can-
cer and fleas followed in order.
Another little bit of in-
formation ran thus: “If you
want to be an A student, love all

of the opposite sex, not just one .

of said sex."

Sex was a big topic then.
Students were advised that
working girls made the best
wives. They saw movies like
*‘Dancing Coed.”

But the most impressive war-
ning was a reprint from Mary
Baldwin, presented for the en-
joyment of the Davidson gen-
tleman. It was all about girls’
rules for dating.

1. Don’t try to make too good
an impression the first night.

2. Be natural.

3. Do something to show your
appreciation.

4. Don't eat too much. The boy
wants to go to school four years,
too.

Now back in 1939 there were
two pretty classy young men
around here. One was Mel
Means who wrote a_ gossip
column called ‘‘Gleanings."
The other was student body
President Sam Spencer.

Mel was prophetic. His
writings echo 1973. In that year
he wrote “Dope wasn't as
readily forthcoming this week
as usual.” What more can be
said?

But voung President Spencer
began a career then which often
appeared in Mel's column. He
was elected in 1939 and made
three major accomplishments
during his tenure.

First. he uncovered a scandal
in the school bookstore. In a
second case. Sam appointed a
committee to determine the
typical Davidson student.

The committee returned with
some striking information. The

typical freshman was your all-
American wimp. He was 5'9"’,
weighed 137 lbs. His hobbies in-
cluded raising tropical fish and
raising calves.

And the five most popular
topics of buil sessions reported
were sports, girl friends, sex,
studies, careers. Well anyway,
it indicated that most people
probably lied in answering their
questionnaires.

But young Spencer's greatest
triumph in office came when he
initiated a matchbook drive.
The young President
discovered that the college
could obtain a seeing-eye dog
for some needy person for a
number of matchbook covers.

Drives were underway.
Students had collected over
8.000 dovers—when the offer
was exposed as a hoax. I think
Sam still has a lot of those old
matchbooks.

Hardly a week went by when
Mel Means did not have
something to say about Sam.
We end our little review of the
year with one of Mel's quotes:

“The worm has turned and
Spencer has had another pic-
ture exchange. this time the
new photo went back to Green-
sboro in return for his frat
pin...Sorrv to hear things went
that way, Sam...Reports have it
that he went on a fishing trip
this weekend... but didn't have
much luck.. Did vou use that
same K.A. pin for bait. Sam?
Betler save it for Converse,
they're biting better down there
just now.”

It was an interesting year.
orally gratifying. without
Alumni Weekend, Mel and Sam.
What more can we say?

Fie On Phi Society

To the Editor:

The Philanthropic society's
blatant use of Sen. Ervin’s lec-
ture Wednesday night. to
elevate their personal prestige
in the eyes of the Davidson com.
munity. was justly ridiculed. It
was an insult to Sen. Ervin to
place him on the same Stage
with such partisan proceedings.

We appreciated the. Philan-

thropic Society's arranging
Sen. Ervin to talk to the David-
son population, as was eviden-
ced by the excellent turnout, but
May we suggest that future
talks do not contain such
Philanthropic propoganda.
