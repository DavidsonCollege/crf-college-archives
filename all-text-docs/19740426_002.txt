‘Gcod Year’ Heralds

Admissions Increase

By PAUL WELCH
Staff Writer

Due to the combined in-
fluence of a number of factors.
the ability of Davidson College
to attract potential students
now appears greater than
ever before in its history

As of April 23. the Office of
Admissions has received a
total of 1400 applications for
admission to the class of 1978.
or 160 more than the highest
previous total.

From this group of pros-
pects. the college accepted 400
men and 120 women. hoping to
enroll 235 and 88 respectively.

Of the 120 women accepted.
16 have already informed the
admissions staff that they do
not wish to enroll here, while
53 more have evidenced firm
desire to do so by paying a $100
nonrefundable tuition deposit.
One hundred and eighteen of
the men accepted have also
paid the deposit. making the
total number received to date
171. The college had only
received 163 such deposits by
this date last vear.

Director of Admissions H.
Edmunds White drew at-
tention to what he called a
“composite’’ cause for the
larger numbers. ‘‘If I had to
pick the most important
reasons,’’ said White, ‘‘they
would probably be a com-

bination of the fact that we've
gone coed with the fact that
we've had a good year this
year.

“Our present students seem
to believe in Davidson and are
willing and able to give
favorable reports to prospec-
tive students.”

He added that he felt that
results indicated that there
are many young people today
who are interested in at-
tending ‘‘a small, high-quality
institution’’ of Davidson's
type.

final report that were recently
made at its 19th meeting.

In several unanimous or
near unanimous votes, the

Communication Snags Hinder Pre-Law

By ANDY LAMAS
Senior News Editor

(Ed Note: This is the final
installment of a two-part
series with Pre-Law Com-
mittee Chairman Winfred P.
Minter.)

“An objective of those in-
volved in giving assistance to
Students interested in law is
that of communicating to
them the fact that the coun-
seling and providing of in-
formation is available to
them," said Pre-Law Commit-
tee Chairman Winfred P.
Minter.

“This is a _ continuing

problem as we have no way of
identifying every student who
may get interested in law as
there is no pre-law major, an

it is up to the student to take
the initiative and seek the
counseling.”

The pre-law committee has
been criticized during the past
several weeks for its decen-
tralized structure.

‘“‘Because of the decen-
tralized character of the ad-
missions requirements and at-
titudes of law schools, we have
to work under relatively un-
structured corditions as com-
pared to the premedical ef-
forts in the counseling area.

“This basic fact should be
kept in mind as it is often
forgotten ,’’ remarked Minter.

He stated that it would not
be feasible or practical to give
more structure to the pre-law

“The basic fact is that the
interested student has the
primary responsibility of
taking initiatives and that the
faculty group involved has the
responsibility of affording him
such reasonable assistance as
it is able.’

Over 80 percent of this
year's senior pre-law ap-
plicants were accepted to law
schools.

“We are not seeking to
claim credit. I think the suc-
cess is due to the students
having attained the high
grades and met the standards
of the law schools,” said Min-
ter.

He emphasized that the pre-
law plan is to attempt to com-
municate to interested stu-
dents the necessity of achiev-
ing records of high quality in
academics. - ¥

The mean score for David-
son students taking the LSAT
in 1969-70 was 577, or in the
70th percentile nationwide.
The mean score for Davidson
students to date this year is
613, or in the 80th percentile.

“This type of improvement
earns plus marks for David-
son with the law schools,”’ he
said.

Minter cited other reasons
for the high acceptance rate of
Davidson pre-law students.

“An explanatory § and
descriptive brochure has been
widely disseminated on the
campus.

“Each fall the freshman
class is given career in-
formation as a part of its
orientation and this includes
law information,” he said.

‘‘During each academic
year a great deal of counseling
takes place involving in-
terested students and much
time is given to this by the

, members, of the. faculty. in-

volved.

‘Faculty counselors seek to
develop a background of in-
formation about law schools,"
Minter stated.

“The visitation of law
schools undertaken last year
was very successful as a
means of obtaining this type of
informational background.

‘An important part of the
planned activities involved the

representatives to visit the
campus in order to talk with
interested students. This con-
tact with law school represen-

faculty members also,”’ con-
tinued Minter.

Some of the law schools to
which Davidson seniors ('74)
were ai include: Wake
