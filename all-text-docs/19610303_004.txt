grinned and said, “inertie is
a great thing.” Dean of Fac-
ulty Erontis Johnston stand-
ing close by, said that Cannon
was confusing inertia and
loyalty.

On politics, Cannoa was just
as glib, if not quite as talkative.
He is executive assistant to the
governor of North Carolina.

“What will happen if the
legislature doesn’t give Terry
Sanford the money he needs to
put through his quality edu-
cation “program?” Cannon was
asked.

“Well, that’s democracy,”
he smiled. He went on to say
that he was confident that
Sanford’s program would be
approved, “After all, three
campaigns were waged and
won on that issue. | haven’t
heard of a single tegislator
who is absolutely opposed to
it, although of course there
are some who don’t go along
with all points of it.”

Cannon would give no indica-
tion that his boss, Terry, had his
eye on a national political post.
“If he has, he’s not saying any-
thing about it. Why that would

be foolish at this stage of the
game in North Caroline.”

Cannon said that he didn't
know what was going to become
of Charles Raper Jonas’s 10th
District, which may be gobbled
up when North Carolina is re-
apportioned. There was a com:
ant that state Democrats may

want to keep Jonas (the state’s
only Republican congressman)
in the 10th District to keep him
from running for governor. “I
don’t care if he does run for
governor,” Cannon said.

He said that he had asked at
least 25 legislators about reap-
portionment and had gotten at
least 25 different plans.

He asked if Terry Sanford
is going to teke a stand on
integration in the public
schools. “He’s not going to
say anything. There’s no need
to. He said all he needed to
say during the second pri-
mary,” Cannon reasoned.

Cannon shed a little light on
ais own political future. “I'm

going to return to practicing

law. There is no tuture in poli-'
ties in North Carolina for me.”

1. I do not think Davidson
has a real drinking problem or
that drinking should ever con-
stitute a problem here. I am
against drinking anywhere on
this campus and I will stand
with our constitution which
makes it an honor offense. The
rule has been liberalized and
it is up to us to enferce it. I
do not think we have a choice
as far as faculty enforcement
but I would like to see them
either abiding by our constitu-
tion or clearly stating under
what grounds or circumstances
they will enforce it.

2. The Student Council under
my supervision will be respon-
sible for the respect of the
rights of any student of David-
son independently from race or
creed. Society, Christianity,

our .Government and our com-
mon sense makes us realize the

imminence of. integration in
education. I am of the firm con-
viction that the Congolese stu-
dents should not be treated as
Guinea pigs while at Davidson
but rather as three additional
students of our college.

3. The writing of an honor
system clause’ in a Student Body
Constitution should be a mere
formality. We should not have
to appeal to Gestapo tactics but
if certain irregularities continue
to endanger the system I would
be willing to take any necessary
measures to improve it.

4. The N.S.A. has always been .

opposed to racial discrimination
in education so it has been boy-
cotted in most of the southern
colleges. Because of its definite
left-wing tendencies and its
shaky reputation I don’t think

we should join it. . '

5. I would propose the closing
of the gap between the student
body and its representatives by
future council meetings in fra-
ternity houses and open forums
in the Union.

6. I am not sure. I do think
that new ideas, a fresh outlook
and new strength should re-
place the “perennial” members
of our student government that
somehow seem to grow .stale
when they take for granted their

1. To me the drinking rule is
our chief headache. I stand
firmly for an alcohol-free camp-
us but feel that administration
policies equating Christianity
with abstinence are ungrounded
morally and realistically. I'll do
all in my power to fight for the
regulation of misconduct as a
result of drinking and not drink-
ing itself.

2. I am sure that Davidson
students will treat these men
with calm and courtesy when
they arrive. However, I feel

is a job for the entire new Stu-
dent Council. We should ask
“What's in it for Davidson?” If
the answer is, “nothing,” let's
stay out.

5. (a) Agitate for student rep-
resentation on every faculty
committee envolving student af-
fairs. This is for purposes of
communication and not for vot-
ing representation.

(b) Make Student Council
available to arbitrate any organ-
izational disputes that have
reached a deadlock. Problems
such as last year’s Independent
vs. IMAC issue should be decid-
ed by student government and
not faculty regulation.

(c) Form a liason board be-
tween students and trustees.

6. My qualifications lie in my
eoncern for Davidson College,
and my faith in Davidson stu-
dents.

1. I definitely favored the step
taken to abolish the “under the
influence” clause, but I am not
in favor of any further liberal-
ization at this time. The regula-
tion pertaining to “conduct un-
becoming a gentleman” is suf-
ficient to cover any troublesome
situation arising from the abol:

qe
YS

orientation that all of our for-
eign students go through during
Orientation Week will be suffi-
cient. I don't think that they
should be made to feel like “a
special case.”

3. The best way to attack this
problem would be to instill in
the student body an awareness
of the importance of an honor
system to a school like Davidson.
I think that this feeling of im-
portance is definitely lacking.
Also, I plan to comment in
Chapel Monday on a proposal
that the duties of the Honor
Court be expanded to help in
this matter.

4. No, because this is an asso-
ciation of student bodies, not
student councils. The dues for
this association are $55 a year,
and I don’t believe that the stu-
dent council, as a council, will
benefit from it that much. It ap-
pears to me to be more of a
Forensic League.

5. (a) The responsibilities of
the Honor Court should be ex-
panded.

(b) The Student Council
should give more active support
to other campus organizations
and teams without becoming a
service club itself.

(c) The Faculty-Student Com-
mittee should be so strengthen-
ed as to correlate the aims of
both groups and to avoid mis-
understandings between them.

6. I have served this past year
on the Honor Court and feel

{ that I have become familiar with

‘ the Student-Body Constitution

or

ishment of the previous clause.
I would prefer to see the stu-
dent body enforce its regulia-
tions instead of requiring the
faculty to en orce their rules.
2. I don’t feel that there is
going to be a need for adjusting
the Davidson student body to
these students. I believe that
they will be accepted as any
other foreign student would be.
As for ‘their adjustment to Da-
vidson, 1 think that the regular

Maloney Arms Home
Against Nuclear War

By ED RUDERT
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Now in the planning stages is a new addition to the

home of Bible Professor Samuel D. Maloney—a radiation
shelter. This move is not as pessimistic as it may seem.
According to Maloney, it is as much a preventive mea-

sure aS a preparative one.

“Actually it seems to me that
you must be pretty hard up for
news,” said Maloney, #There's
nothing unique about what I’m
doing. For a nominal expense I
will be able to finish my house
and provide a radiation shelter
at the same time.

THIRD BATH

“When I built the house I left
a third bathroom in the base-
ment without a wall. This spring
Pll finish the bathroom and
utilize the space behind it as a
radiation shelter. In the interim,
so to speak,” he continued with
a laugh, “it will serve as a dark-
room.’
| Continuing with his reference
to the project as a preventive
measure Maloney said, “Like
armament for a nation, this can
be one of the great preventives.
Individuals can take part in this
preventive effort.

“To me this is a personal
means of preparation. If we are
prepared, whoever would bomb
us would have less to gain and
would be less inclined to at-

in any outside orgenization. This tack.”

“I'm also doing it out of
concern for my family,” he said.
“You can compare it to buying
life insurance.”

Maloney became greatly inter-
ested in civil defense through
his position as Chaplain in the
North Carolina Air National
Guard.

“Cooperation with civil de-
fense is stressed more heavily
in other parts of the country. I
believe in the civil defense and
working with them.

PATRIOTIC THING

ment as to the imminence of

decade we have just entered
will be touch-and-go.

“This is the first time man
has had the power to destroy
life on a wide scale — in fact,
to destroy civilization,” Maloney
added, emphasizing his opinion
that individual citizens can
serve a constructive purpose in
civil defense.

Maloney concluded, “J think
it’s a patriotic thing to do. This

is my wey of backing up my
belief in civil defense.”

events.
3. Enforcement of the honor

system is not in need of im

provement; student attitude to-
ward it is. This situation can be

corrected by an effective pre-

sentation of the system by the
council to the freshmen and a
clarification of the Honor
Court’s opinions on all factors
of the system (diving, the ROTC
writ pledge, etc.) The difficulty
of.the problem at present stems
from eonfusion and misunder-
standing about the court's posi-
tion.

4. The council at present en-
joys the benefits of NSA mem-
bership without identifying it-
self with the left-wing reputa-
tion of the organization. I am
not opposed to discussion on the
question, however.

5. 1) Develop an effective
means of expression of student
body opinion to faculty, admin-
istration, and trustees.

2) Formulate a definite divi-
sion of responsibility for the
three branches of student gov-
ernment.

3) Undertake to encourage in-

=

creased participation in student
government and increased sup-
port for student activities (ath-
letic, dramatic, etc.)

6. The president must take as
his primary objective to rep-
resent accurately the entire stu-
dent body. However, there are
two sides to the office: one is
representation; the other is
leadership. Goals must be set,
ideas advanced, and discussions
held. But the president must be
willing to subordinate his own
interests to representation of
student opinion. My desire for
this kind of student government
and my willingness to do these
things are my reasons for seek-
ing the office and my qualifica-
tions for election.

Davidson Life Proves

‘Enriching’

For Juel

By KRISTIAN JUEL

Richardson Scholer
Editor’s Note: This is the twelfth in eo series of articles by
Richardson Scholars about characteristics of their homelends,
or on their impressions of Davidson.

After six months at Davidson College as a Richardson
Scholar, (the first time I have ever been mentioned as a
scholar) I hope to have become fairly well acquainted with
the various aspects of student life at Davidson — from

vespers to Hattie’s.

I shall here list a few of my
experiences on the Davidson
campus.

One of my most interesting

. experiences this fall was to work

for the Slater System. I quit the
| job after some time though, be-
cause I was afraid it would
eventually make a communist
out of me.
During my stay at Davidson
1 have become a fan of the
American national sports, foot-
ball and basketball; especially
basketball, because even if
the game itself is not too
geod, one can always find
amusement in the wild war

vidson coach around = the
court, guiding the referees ir

dent in this article. At least I
have increased my vocabulary,
by the help of the Davidson
students, with a number of
words and expressions that were
not known, or at least not
taught, by my English teachers
at home. These expressions, I
would presume, are termed
colloquial in Webster's.

The exeprience | have ap-
preciated the most, while at
Davidson has been that of be-
coming associated with o fra-
ternity, which | now of course
regard as the best on campus.

Concerning the subject of

'|“free love” in Norway, this has

been dealt with so thoroughly
by Reader's Digest, Life, and
other scientific publications that
1 could add nothing to it without
stating the fact that it is not
true; and that would pe to take
away a pleasant dream from
the Davidson students. More-
over, it would hurt the tourist
traffic.
