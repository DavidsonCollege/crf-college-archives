FOUR MILLS BROTHERS ARE
GRADUATES OF DAVIDSON

In more than one instance Davidson
has seen four members of a family pass
through her halls to graduation and on
into the world to do service to mankind.
One of these sets of four brothers is
composed of W. H. Mills, ’92; L. T. Mills,
094; J. E. Mills, ’96, and W. P. Mills, ’o3.

W. H. Mills took the degree of Bach-
clor of Arts at Davidson in 1892. He
has received the degree of B.D. from
Columbia Theological Seminary (1897)
and that of D.D. from the Presbyterian
College of South Carolina. He has held
pastorates in Virginia and North Caro-
lina, at one time being pastor of the
Presbyterian Church at Clemson Col-|
lege (1907-1917). He has gained emi-
rent distinction in his knowledge of
rural life. He was professor of Rural
Sociology and a specialist in Rural Or-
ganization at Clemson College during
the years of 1917-1921. He has also been
Instructor in Rural Sociology and the
Work of the Country Pastor at Colum-
bia Theological Seminary and an_ in-
structor in charge of the Department of
Rural Economics and Sociology, A. E.
F. University, Beaune, France, during*
the war.

The second of these illustratious
brothers is L. T. Mills, who received
the A.B. degree at Davidson in 1894.~ He
has received a B.L. degree. from the
University of South Carolina and is now
practicing law in Camden, S. C. He is
prominent in city and county public
school administration and has done
particularly noticeable work toward
helping forward the negro schools of
his county.

Ao 33, Mills graduated from Davidson
with an A.B. degree in 1896 but returned

to his Alma Mater two years later
for an A.M. He holds a Ph.D. from
Cornel, The line of work in which he

has attained distinction has been chem-
istry. He has pursued special studies at
Rerlin and at Trinity College, Dublin.
During the war he did important re-
search work in chemical warfare. He
was captain of the first Gas Regiment
Chemical Warfare Service, A. E. F., in
1917-1918, and major in the first Gas
Regiment, Chemical Warfare Service,
1918-1919. He has held the position of
director of the department of research

and development of chemical warfare
at the Edgewood arsenal. He is author
of numerous articles on vaporization

and the chemistry of gases.

W. P. Mills has an A.B. from David-
son, an A.M. from the University of
South Carolina, a B.D. from Columbia
Theological Seminary and an M.A. from
Oxford University, England. He was
the Rhodes scholar from South Carolina
in 1907-1910. After returning from
England he became secretary of the Y.
M. C. A. ‘in the University of South
Carolina, and remained in that position
for two years. Since then he has done
extensive Y. M. C. A, work, having been
“Y" secretary in Nanking, China; Pe-
king, China; Tokyo, Japan, and travel-
ing Y. M. C. A, secretary among Chinese
students in American Colleges. He was
prominent in the China Famine Relief
work. He is now Y. M. C. A. secreary
in Hankow, China.

ALUMNI—WHAT ABOUT
COMMENCEMENT?

Enterprising alumni are already mak-
ing plans for commencement. Karl
Sherrill, of Statesville, N. C., has sent
notices to all the mémbers of a reunion
of the class of 1912.

This year shows every promise of be-
ing a banner year in Davidson’s history.
The enrollment is larger than any in
the past and will hold the record for
size for some years to come.

Besides the usual graduation exercises
the Senior class is planning many special
features which will add to the attractive-
ness of jthe occasion. Some of these
that are being considered are: a faculty
versus the alumni baseball game, a car-
nival and a general parade.

Then the ruins of old Charmbers, so
dear to’ the heart of every Davidsonian
would be a favorable location for a class
reunion. There they could _ recall

memories of the days of yore when
Chambers was Davidson.

After reminiscing there awhile they,
could go around and see the beginnings |
of the future greater Davidson. They |
could walk over to the new dormitory |
which will be well under way at that}
time, and to the new physical building |
right behind it with all the modern |
equipment of a good laboratory. If they!
are a trifle more eager to see changes
they can walk a bit further and see the
two new barracks, the beginning of the
central heating plant, the class building
oir Concord street, the half-dozen—or}
more new professors’ houses, Louisiana
dormitory, Smith’s apartments, and
many other new additions.

Thus they will see that Davidson is
still functioning even though crippled
a bit by the fire. :

Class presidents, and others interested
should stir up some pep and make this
commencement an event to be remem-
bered.

ROWAN COUNTY MEN
PLAN TO GET MORE
MEN TO DAVIDSON

The Rowan County boys took a step
forward at a feed given last Saturday
night. The club decided that it should
have more boys from Rowan to come
to Davidson next year. There are 15
now. The club has set its goal at twice
that number. There will be approxi-
mately 100 boys to graduate in the high
schools of the county this spring® and
they feel that there is no reason why
Davidson cannot get at least 15 good
boys from this number. The plan is to
send each high school senior a Bulletin
along with any literature Mr. Jackson
can furnish, and write each one a letter
encouraging him to come to Davidson.
This letter was drawn up at the meeting.

Preceding the business session there
had been a sure-enough feed which pre-
pared all for the undertaking at hand.
The Rowan County Club hopes that oth-
er like organizations will join in the
effort to bring men to Davidson.
