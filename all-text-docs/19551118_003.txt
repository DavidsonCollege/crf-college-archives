In Atlanta last week the premier quarterback of our era,
Otto Graham, unleased a blast at the methods utilized in pro
football today. It was his opinion that if the owners and of-
ficials do not curb the “dirty” tactics extant, the sport is de-
stined to “hit the rocks.”

Responses resounded from across the nation, both in
agreement and violent opposition. “Slinging Sammy” Baugh
raised the most influencial dissenting voice, and his sixteen
long years of stardom in the league are testimony to the fact
that the star is not always the object of enemy attack. How-
ever, “Life” had run a series of pictures a few weeks ago,

clearly corroborating Graham's view and giving graphic evi-

dence of malicious injuries.

A distant ancestor of our modern game was evidently
regarded in the same light by one scribe who said in 1583 that
it was “rather .. . a bloody and murthering practise than a
felowly sporte or pastime. . . . For doth not every one lye in
waight for his Adversary, seeking to overthrow him & to picke
him on his noce . . . so that by this meanes, sometimes their
backs are broken, sometime their necks, sometime their armes;
sometime the noses gush out with blood, sometime their eyes
start out .. . an herof groweth envie, malice, rancour, en-
mitie, and whot not els; and sometime fighting, brawling, mur-
ther, and great effusion of blood, as experience dayly teach-
eth.”

In the evolution of football on the college level, there has
been a firm tendency to develop a vigorous, but not overly
dangerous, sport. One President, Teddy Roosevelt, even en-
tered a reform of the brutal “flying wedge.” On the Richard-
son Stadium turf action, as a rule, has been crisp and tough,
but rarely dirty. With exceptions, of course, the tough guys of
the scholastice game seem to be far outnumbered by those
that play it clean.

It appears, in the face of numerous comments, that per-
haps Mr. Graham was just a little off base. Certainly pro ball
is tough. When you get muscular athletes, averaging close to
240 pounds each, slaming into each other with ferocious vio-
lence, something has to give. Apparently it is the savagery of
the play, along with the perfection, that finds thousands lining
the stands Sunday after Sunday. And part of this take has
made Graham, rightly enough, a rather wealthy young man.

At the same time that the end came for the DC hopes as
Wofford added a clinching T D with about five minutes re-
maining in the game, 68,000 people thought that the end had
come for Texas A&M. Behind 12-0 and fading fast, the clock
indicated 4 minutes and 45 seconds. When this time had
elapsed, the scoreboard showed the count to be in A&M's
favor, 20 to 12 (over Rice) in what surely must have been one
of the greatest comebacks of all time . . .

. . . Just forty years ago this week Davidson routed a
fighting, but weak, Furman outfit, 58 to 13. Could history re-
peat itself? . . . There is hope for all of us. Pete McKnight,
influential editor of the Charlotte Observer, was writing sport
items for the Davidsonian only twenty years ago. Selah!

To Cat quarterback Dyke Little
go this week's athletic laurels
because of his performance in last
Saturday's Wofford game. Dyke
came off the bench to take over
the reins of the faltering Cat of-
fense and played his best game of
the year. He personally accounted
for 120 of Davidson's yards with
his passes. completing 8 out of 13.

An excellént player on both his
freshman team and last year's first
string, which he operated most of
the season, Dyke took a back seat
to Belton during the first part of
the season; but it is a credit to him
and his perseverance that he con
tinued to play a smart and alert
brand of football and’ capitalized |
on his chance to run the first squad
last week.

Already the 5-11", 160-pound
junior has passed for 402 yards
which betters his last year’s total
by 16. His arm has also improved

“COLLEGIATE FASHIONS”
DAVIDSON, N. C.

the: publicity departments of the
individual schools begin to “boom”
their star players for all-star men-
tion, Davidson likewise has three
men that it feels are worthy of All
Conference rating at the least.

It has long been a sore point
from the athletic viewpoint that
the press has neglected to regard
the Davidson candidates with much
respect. However, with the out-
standing team of this year, it is
going to be very hard to overlook
the Cat stalwarts in the polls.

Dick Belton, the leading passer
in the conference, heads up the
list. A fine all-around leader, Dick
has been instrumental in the rise
of the local football fortunes.
Among his accomplishments was
selection as Player of the Week in
the Conference.

Also on the publicity release was
Bill Gramley, the leading pass-re-
ceiver in the loop. “The Stallion”
has grabbed 21 passes, while
turning in his usual vicious job
on defense. Tremendously strong,
Bill has been a pillar of strength on
both offense and defense.

Sophomore Bill Price, who has
| been first string center almost since
he enrolled at Davidson, is the
other nominee. Working in the
middle of things, where there is
little glamor, Bill has been out-

| standing in every game. Known

for his resounding tackles from
the line backer slot, he is also ex-
tremely efficient in opening the

tholes up the middle.

Saturday at Greenville, S. C., the
1955 Wildcat football force brings
down the curtain on one of the
most exciting seasons in the history
of the school. Furman, matehing its |
0-8 record against D.C,’s 5-3 slate, |
will supply the competition
