Davidson’s Track Team
Victorius Over S. C.

Murray Breaks College Record for
220-Yard Dash.

Captain McTuller’s squad easily took
the measure of the South Carolina track
team in the meet held here Saturday
afternoon. The main feature of the
contest was the 220-yard dash which
was won by Murray in the record time
of 22 2-5 seconds. The record was pre-
viously held by J. W. S. Gilchrist, ’15,
who made the distance in 23 flat. The
half mile which was won by Finley also
proved sensational. The final score was
fifty-six to thirty-four.

Those men winning their letter for
the first time are Finley, McLeod, Brice,
Sprunt and A. R. Craig. The last
named is to be especially commended on
the sportsmanlike spirit shown in the
mile run. Murray won his first star,
and McQueen his second.

JUNIORS TAKE OPENING
GAME OF CLASS SERIES

In the opening game of class baseball
the junior aggregation defeated the Se-
niors by a score of six to three. The
game was interesting and amusing
through the entire nine innings. Currie
and McAskill were the Senior batter-
ies, while Cathey and Brady performed
for the Juniors. Both pitchers were hit
hard, but the game was determined by
errors and not hitting. The Seniors
lined up as follows: Turner, ss; Rob-
son. 2b.; Love, 1b; Wilson, cf.; Mc-
Askill, c.; Craig, A. R., 3b.; Hall, W.
A.. rf.; Davenport, If.; Currie, p. The
Junior ljne-up was: McAlister, cf.;
Cathey. p.; Craig, R. R., 2b.; McCon-
nell, cf.; McLese, If.; Brady, c.; Hall,
W. F., 1b; Black, R. L.. 3 b.; Thomas

CLARK AND CASSELL LEAD
IN BATTING AVERAGES

‘The batting average for the team

‘through the game with ‘Trinity Friday

shows Clark and Cassell leading, fel-
lowed closely by Cop Johnson. “The
lack of hitting in the first two games
causes the general average to be some-
what low, however. In the last. three
games it showed quite an improvement
and by next week, we expect a much
higher average.
