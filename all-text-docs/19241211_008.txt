the object being to increase

reached $80,000,000.

With the income at $2,000,000 and with
20 per cent of this amount being added
to the principal each year it would leave

Davidson was designated to receive five

Mr. Duke stated to Dr. Martin that
the income of next year has already

been set aside and will be used in build-

increase the worth of the stock propor-
tionately.

When Dr. Martin was asked if there
were any limitations on the use of the
money he stated that there were none,
and referred to the official statement,
the extract concerning Davidson read,

cated at Davidson, N. C., for all purposes

this leaves the impression that

Mr. F. L. Jackson, treasurer of the col-
lege, stated by way of comparison that
the income from the endowment of the

endowment it means that Davidson will |

A brief sketch of the new letter men fol-
lows :

James F. Pinkney, of Beckley, W. Va.,
is the first of West Virginia’s sons to win
a varsity berth in football at Davidson in
many years. He was a member the
‘Freshman football squad during his first
year in college, and was awarded his D. C.
at the end of his Freshman season. Report-
ing for early practice along with numerous
other candidates, who possibly seemed more
likely material, Pinkney stuck it out and by
his grim determination, pluck, and dauntless
spirit landed a place on the left flank of the
line, where he played for 23 quarters, Pink-
ney is secretary and treasurer of the student
body, and a member of the student council.

of

Ernest F. Bohannon, of Davidson, came to
college with a fair bid for football honors
and an ambition to make his letter on the
varsity football squad. By his excellent work
on end during the past season both aims have
been realized. Bohannon was also a mem-
Coach Rawson's famous Wildkitten
eleven of '23, and was a winner of a D, C.
during his Freshman year. Bohannon, with
the exception of the short time that he was
confined to the sidelines because of injuries,
was a big factor in the many victories won
‘by Davidson during the past season,

ber of

Joe McConnell, of Davidson, was the pivot
man this year for the best team Davidson has
had in a long time, and it was due to his ex-
cellent passes on the offense and his un-
relenting drive on the defense that so much
success came to the Wildcats this season. |
Like Pinkney and Bohannon, McConnell won |
his Freshman letter last year; and when the |
time came for trials for positions on the |
varsity squad, McConnell was there and}
ready. He has starred in the line this year
both by his own faultless playing and the
| fine influence exerted by him over his fel-
law. teammates.

Julius W. Anderson, of Me lecacii; SiG
{was a member of the Freshman team of '22,
‘and a candidate for varsity honors last sea-
This year he has appeared in a number
of games and has been a valuable player in
the line. Anderson has already won a “D”
in track, being a pole-vaulter, javelin, and
hurdle star. Anderson will return next year,
and will mean a lot in building up the 25
varsity team.

son.

| Nick Sappenfield, of Concord, N. C.,, is
| probably the most brilliant player among the
j/new letter men. He was mentioned by prac-
|tically all newspapers over the state for the
| position of second all-state quarterback, and
jhis work as field-general of the Wildcat
eleven during the past season was practically
|perfect. Having a quick mind, and a keen
| football intuition, Sappenfield has been able
|to send his teammates crashing through the
|weak places which he always manages to
|detect in his opponents’ line. His fine work
at quarter has been one of the big factors in
theSpictories by Davidson over the much
|heavier and more experienced teams, with
which the Wildcats coped during the past
season, Sappenfield is one of the most popu-
\lar students on the campus, being vice-presi-
|dent of the student. body and bidding fair to
!win other honors and offices before his col- |
lege career is over. He will return for an- |
other season at quarter next fall, and his
}return will add much to the hopes and am-
bitions of Davidson followers.

Wade H. Leggette, of Red Springs, N. C.,
has won an important place on the eleven
‘during the last season, and was depended on
|by ‘the coaches both for deadly defensive
|tackling in the secondary defense, and for
{fine runs and long punts on the offensive.

Leggette came to the varsity from the Fresh-
| man team of which he was a member during
|his first year in college. Leggette is already
one of the big men on the varsity, but with
more coaching and experience, he is certain
|to make Davidson as valuable backfield man
as she has had in many years.

W. A. McAulay, Mt. Gilead, another of the
Old North State's contributions to the Wild-
cat team, made his letter this year by a fine
combination of sheer grit and ability. His
stocky build and his fighting spirit greatly
strengthened the line when it seemed that
heavier teams would break through for long
gains. McAulay has made Davidson a fine

,| player, and when he returns next year, as it

hoped he will, the Wildcats’ chances for an-
other successful season will rise considerably.

David T. McComb, of Hickory, N. C., is
another of Davidson’s premier red-headed
battlers. For two years McComb fought for
a berth on the varsity squad, and his am-
bitions were not to be denied. He made the
team this year, and his fine work in the back-
{field during the past.season made him one of
the mainstays on the team. McComb won
his letter two years ago in, track, and will
probably be back in the cinder-path auad
again this year.

campaign was to raise money improving
Presbyterian schools in North Carolina.
One whole page was devoted to pictures

,of other schools in North Carolina which

were to benefit from the campaign.

Half of the amount asked for was to

American Glee Club to
Appear Here on Tuesday

" Third of Lyceum Numbers to be
Presented in Shearer Hall

The local Piedmont Lyceum Committee
announces that the American Glee Club, a
singing quartet, ‘will appear at Shearer Hall
on December 16th, as one of the DeLuxe
Lyceum numbers. The organization has had
five years’ experience as a quartet. Their
work is on a high plane of artistic endeavor ;
as a singing organization it has few equals.

The program of the Glee Club will be in-
terspersed with musical selections, including
saxophones and xylophones. Snappy read-
ings and pianologues will be introduced and
the program will be carried along without
breaks from the beginning to the end. The
quartet is highly recommended by many
who have heard it. From the Hamilton
(Kansas) Lygeum Committee the following
is quoted:

“The American Glee Club pleased our peo-

ple very much. The bass and baritone were
especially commended on their individual
work. I think I am safe in saying it was
the strongest male quartet that has ever ap-
peared in this town.”

This number, one of the Piedmont DeLuxe
attractions, includes four young men who are
splendid musicians and entertainers.

The tackles, with Laird and Anderson
back, along with Richie and Red Grey, should
not be so weak as they started off this year.
Line-coach Tilson was well-pleased with the
game that Red Anderson put up against the
Blue Devils.
