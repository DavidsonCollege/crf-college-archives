City Competes for) Reconsider “Tribute” Parties

the 2020 Olympics

In response to the recent
heartbreaking selection of Rio de
Janeiro to host the 2016 Olympics
over Chicago, the United States
Olympic Committee is choosing
Detroit for its next Olympic candi-
date city.

“We have to pull out the big
guns now,” said Stephanie Streeter,
acting chief executive of the
USOC. “Looking at Rio, and South
Africa, host country of the 2010
World Cup, it is clear that America
has to step up its game to compete
with these highly developed and
extraordinarily competitive coun-
tries. America now has to show-
case its finest city, Detroit, to have
any hope of hosting a major inter-
national sporting competition.”

Support for a Detroit Olympic
bid is strong in the city. Detroit
mayor Dave Bing recently ex-
plained why his city is the city to
beat.

“Detroit’s unemployment rate
has hit an all time low of 30%,
not to mention our crime rate is
now just the sixth highest in the
nation!” reported a jovial mayor
Bing, “with those numbers, we can
definitely compete with places like
Rio de Janeiro and South Africa.”

The proposed 2020 Athlete’s Village

Local residents have expressed
their passion and desire to bring
the Olympics to Detroit, but enthu-
siasm for the Detroit Olympic bid
has not been ubiquitous. One angry
opponent of the Detroit bid, Rob-
ert Ritchie said, “I don’t want any
damn people in this city, except for
those female gymnasts!” “Get off
my property,” shouted another an-
gry denizen of Detroit, “Beardo,” a
local homeless man.

Despite these critics, many,
including President Obama, have
vocalized their support for the
bid. Minutes after Chicago lost
the 2016 bid, President Obama
remarked, “Detroit is a much better
city than Chicago. In fact, Detroit
is the best city in America, and
it’s time the world sees this....
Hope....Change.”

Davidson—Eating house War-
ner Hall has recently decided it
will no longer throw its signature
party “Madonnarama” every year.
Instead Warner will replace the
tribute with the “Kenny G Gala.”

Warner Hall’s tribute to Kenneth
Gorelick will feature the smoothest
jams the Court has ever heard

“We really didn’t feel the en-
thusiasm was there for this party,
even from Warner members. Most
people don’t really know who
Madonna is anymore, and the
novelty of bad 80s music wears
off pretty quickly,” said Warner
Hall President Sandy Westgate
said. “The fall is critical for mak-
ing a good impression on the first
year students. We wanted to have
a party around a figure that says,
“we are smart, but like to have a
good time.’ Kenny G was the obvi-
ous choice. We all love Kenny G
and you can always hear his music
blasting from F on Friday night
anyway.”

“Kenny G was the

obvious choice.”

Kenny G is a Grammy award
winning alto-sax player who also
holds the world record for play-
ing a single saxophone note for
a whopping 45 minutes and 47
seconds. Next year the Kenny G
Gala will kick off with a Pre-party
at F with special Mezzo Soprano
punch mix. Mayhem will ensue at
the house as party-goers will danc
the night away to classics such as
“G Force,” “Breathless” and “At
Last...the Duets Album.” “The
E-flat he played for 45 minutes wil
get things started off right,” said
social chair Michelle Smith. “The
Kenny G Gala will be one for the
ages and a great night for Warner

Davidson— The brothers of
Alpha Tau fraternity announced
a new, better type of court party
Monday. With recent star-obses-
sions enveloping Taylor Swift,
Madonna, etc. the brothers have
decided to take Patterson in a com-
pletely different direction.

In an effort to shy away from
the repetition of spandex and bed-
sheet togas, the Taus have chosen
television’s B-list celebrity bad-
boy, Bob Saget, as the star of their
next party.

Kevin Stuart ‘10 explained,
“We feel like this will really liven
up the social scene at Davidson.
Whe doesn’t love Danny Tanner?
And who could forget his role as
the middle-aged Cocaine addict in
the timeless classic, Half-Baked?
There are so many characters to
choose from, I think people will
really have fun with this one.”

This unorthodox maneuver
sprung from the internet sensa-
tion Rollin’ Wit Saget, a masterful
online video that showcased Bob
Saget’s talents as a ruthless thug/
rapper who claims to be “the illest
motherf--ker in a cardigan sweat-
er” and an overall badass.

Trend forecasters cannot pre-
dict the effect this will have on
our culture’s has-beens. Alpha
Tau will be the first fraternity to
attempt this, but surely the rest
of Patterson Court is only a few
weekends away. Other possible
celebrity themes include Jackie
Chan/KungFu Panda Party, Charlie
Sheen “Wild Thing Wednesday”
and Mike Tyson’s “Meatface Mon-
day” cookout.

Belting Out to

Tighten the Belts

This year, Davidson College
is initiating a new budget-saving
measure called “Singing for
Savings.” Since the start of the
2009-10 academic year, the ad-
ministration has been converting
every sports team, eating house,
fraternity, and club into a harmo-
nizing singing group, also known
as a cappella.

“This way,” explained project
coordinator Delilah General, “stu-
dents can have fun and participate
in extracurricular activities virtual-
ly for free. A capella groups don’t
use any instruments—it’s genius!
We’ ve already locked down our
free pianist, and now this!

“We are especially proud of
converting all the athletes. Now
we don’t have to pay for uniforms,
bus trips, meals, rehab equipment
or hotel rooms. We were able to
convert Baker Sports Complex
into an auditorium, and we will
save hundreds of thousands per
year by not paying coaching staffs,
trainers or referees.”

Formerly the footbali team, the
new group Colossus looks forward
to taking the stage later this month
in their debut.

Principal performer Matt Guer-
rieri, whose stage name is now
“Gooey,” said yesterday, “There’s
a lot of chest-bumping. It fits well
with the harmonizing of our for-
mer defensive line, which sings
alto. And watch for my solo in
‘The Way You Make Me Feel’.”

Colossus wiill be joined on
stage by Legs (formerly men’s
basketball), Skirts ‘N’ Sticks (field
hockey), and SkinnySwift (track
and field/cross country).

Major Disappointment:
The Yowl’s Handy Guide

Major: Psychology

Reasons people choose this
major: They love tracking the
status of Davidson College’s
mental health; they have a crush
on Sigmund Freud; they enjoy un-
necessarily psycho-analyzing their
friends’ problems; statistics actu-
ally make sense to them; they are
hooked on Myers-Brigg and try to
guess everyone’s personality type;
independent and dependent vari-
ables rock their world.

Where they study abroad: In
the basement of Dana.

Career options: family,
couples, or individual counseling;
urban planning; neuroscience re-

search; education administration;
marketing; fortune telling out of

a bright purple tent at the annual

Renaissance Festival.

Why people avoid this ma-
jor: They would prefer not to
know what horrible mental disor-
ders they have

Description: Psych majors are
those poor, misguided souls who
think that learning about this sub-
ject will improve their social inter-
actions. They all secretly believe
that they can never fit the ideal of
human behavior and spend their
days projecting their own develop-
mental problems onto others. They
are terrible with relationships.
