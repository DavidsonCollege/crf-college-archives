THE DAVIDSONIAN

By Liz NEIHEISEL

The temporary walls of the new
Life Sciences building are now extrava-
gant with color and design, showing the
results of Davidson students and com-
munity members who turned out Satur-
day to Paint the Wall.

This event, coupled with Sunday's
rain-washed CROP Walk, can mean
only one thing: Into the Streets 1997 has
arrived.

Spanning the weeks between Oct:
25 and Nov. 9, Into the Streets is°a
national program designed to engage
members of the community in thought-
ful community service. While the event
itself encourages individuals to partici-
pate in short-term service projects and
increase awareness, the ongoing goal of
ITS is to “unite campus and community
in solving problems we face as soci-
ety.”

This years Into the Streets pro-
gram is in only its second year, spawned
by the efforts of Davidson students Bill
Abrams and Brian Campbell inthe 1996-
97 school year.

Abrahms, now a Davidson alum-
nus and the College's community ser-
vice coordinator, has been instrumental
in this year’s program,

The ITS coalition is currently com-
prised of 10 individuals, including stu-
dents, one faculty member, and one
member of the Davidson community.
This year’s student leaders are Emily
Katzfey and Andrew Letizia.

“If we get just one person who has
never done service before to partici-
pate, learn, and want to go back again,
I will feel like our work was worth it,”

_ Katzfey said.

A variety of additional students
are help ing to host and facilitate the
various ITS activities, which include
professional and student speakers, a
hunger banquet, work at a local
children’s schoolhouse, a haunted house
and carnival at Ada Jenkins, Habitat for
Humanity workdays, and highway
clean-up.

Katzfey urges anyone who is in-
terested in participating with ITS to
contact one of the coordinators and get
involved.

ITS’s kick-off event to paint the
temporary walls of the new Life Sci-
ences building was organized by stu-
dents Kurt Fesenmyer and Yu-Jay Har-
ris, co-chairmen of the Solidarity Com-
mittee. The Solidarity Committee, a
subcouncil of SGA, is designed to pro-
mote solidarity among the college com-
munity.

The painting of the wall was the
committee’s first event in awhile, and
was aimed to pull together individuals
from both the Davidson community
and the college. .

“We were hoping for a little more
diversity in the group,” Harris said. “I
think a lack of publicity in town made it
harder for this to happen.”

The plan to paint the wall was a
result of several individuals who, after
the wall was defaced in the spring,
wanted to decorate it more tastefully.

“We were lucky to have good
weather,” Fesenmyer said.

“Everyone who was there had a
very good time. The day was a chance
for different people to come together
and work as a team, to share their artis-
tic talent.”

As the kick-off event for Into the
Streets, a program designed to teach the
community about serving others, Har-
ris viewed the event’s inaugural status
with a twist. “The event was a good
way to begin (the program),” he said.
“By learning to love yourself, you can
learn to love others as well.”

Saturday’s momentum continued
into Sunday as over 75 participants took
part in the 19th annual local CROP
Walk. The event, a 10-kilometer run or
walk through the rainy streets of

Davidson, has been growing since its

origination in the late 1970s.

event was plagued by rainy skies, CROP
coordinator Whitney Frazier said, “The
event is always a success if you create
an awareness.” ‘
Proceeds from the CROP walk

will be supported in the coming weeks

The lunch is a meal of beans, rice,

Lunch will take place the following

would have to be voted onto the
Patterson Court Council, and would not
automatically become members upon
their arrival at Davidson. The sororities
also would not have their own houses,
and have strictly enforced policies pro-
hibiting the use of alcohol, so their
presence on the Court would be very
limited.

They could co-sponsor parties on
the Court,

mitted, but

One audience member addressed
the exclusiveness of sororities by say-
ing, “You're kidding yourself if you
think that sororities aren’t the most ex-
clusive thing you can bring to
Davidson.”

Matthew Hobbie continued the ar-
gument by pointing out that Davidson
students have already been chosen once
by being accepted to the College. And
“as for
equality,”
he said,
“you're
going the
wrong
way with
this.”

“eating houses take on enormous liabil-

Meredith Mosely, amember of the

A telephone poll, conducted by
the SGA in conjunction with the politi-
cal science department, will be con-
ducted soon to determine whether the
interest in sororities at Davidson is suf-
ficient to justify installing them.

The end decision on whether so-
rorities come to Davidson, however,
belongs to President Vagt.

“They are unnecessary.

Davidson has survived this

long without them, why do
we need them now?”

ON THE STREET

What are your views concerning sororities on campus?

“|don’t think that people are giving the women of Davidson
enough credit. Change occurs for a reason, and | think we
should trust in what the women of Davidson want.”

“The sorority system’‘s one difference from eating houses is
their selectivity and elitist nature. If both of these elements
(however undisirable) are to be taken from them, there is
nothing to differentiate them from eating houses, and
therefore no reason for their presence.”
