Dale Kennington exhibit focuses on everyday realism

By Jonathan Brooks

A waiter arranges napkins on
a table while the soft, late after-
noon light filters through a win-
dow. Quiet reflections of every-
day life such as this one constitute
the works of Dale Kennington’s
show Time and Place. The
Wiregrass Museum of Art orga-
. nized the art show, which is cur-
rently at-the Visual Arts Center.

Although Kennington focuses
on everyday occurrences, she
chooses moments which. are per-
sonal so that the viewer can more
readily identify with the imagery.
Sam W. Kates, Director of the
Wiregrass Museum of Art, has “fre-
quently observed young and old
alike pausing for longer than aver-
age time to contemplate and re-
. flect on the imagery.”

One painting depicts a group
of average people smoking ciga-
rettes and drinking beer at a cafe.
Another work shows a pianist play-
ing at a lounge with such subtle
details as a teetering dollar bill on

FRIDAY — You don’t have
to wait until 10:30 or 11:00 to get
your weekend started. Go to City
Fair and catch Live at Five. It’s a
party to officially kick off each
weekend. Charlotte is trying to
revitalize its downtown area, so
recently, they added City Fair. A
bar with a huge variety of frozen
drinks, Fat Tuesdays at City Fair is
not to be missed. City Fair also has
a virtual reality game for five dol-
lars, and Mardi Gras, which houses
a food court with a section where
local bands perform. After that,
head over to the Frozen Dawg.
This place is definitely the bar of
choice for Davidson grads. It has
pool tables and a huge bar. It can
get a bit crowded, but I guarantee
you’ ll see someone you know.

SATURDAY — Drag out the
clothes you wore to 70s'party and
disco the night away at Clarence
Foster’s, right next door to Frozen
Dawg. The music is great, and
everyone is dancing. If you liked
the feel of the neighboring bar,
you’ll love this one.

SUNDAY — Wrap up the
week with a different sort of enter-
tainment, the polo matches on
Providence Road. This is a unique
social event on Sunday afternoon
if you want to just sit back and
enjoy a beautiful day. Finally, cap
off the week by going to the Cajun
Queen for a relaxing evening of
jazz and cajun food.

Well there it is. I could prob-
ably come up with another week’s
worth because I did not even men-
tion the Hornets and Checkers

games or all of the great restau-.

rants in Dilworth and Elizabeth,

fabulous light display in
McAdenville (just west of Char-
lotte). It’s guaranteed to get any-
one in the holiday spirit!

the rim of his tip jar. The works
typically deal with peaceful mo-
ments in a bar, in a dining room, or
on a terrace. Kennington avoids
active, highly charged moments;
instead, she opts for subtle mo-

The subtle realism that is evi-
dent in Kennington’s subject mat-
ter is also communicated in her
style. The artist employs a near.
photo-realism, although she does ~
not create the highly polished sur-
face typical of photo-realistic art-
works. Kennington instead
chooses arougher brush stroke that
is appropriate for the impression-
istic, momentary glimpse of a quiet
