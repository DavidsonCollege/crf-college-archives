Ruins, Women and Ouzo Abound In Classics Program

By Will Montgomery

Last year at this time the pro-
gram called ‘Davidson in the Lands
of Classical Antiquity” or more
simply “Classics Abroad” had just
spent two weeks on the island of
Crete. We were now in Athens for
a few days, going to lectures be-
side the Acropolis or to the Athens
museum.

In all, the program spent
roughly two months in Greece, two
weeks in Turkey, a month in Italy,
and ten days in Nimes, France. I

“Roman Architecture” given in the
Pantheon in Rome.

We learned the background of
almost every major offered at
Davidson. The point of saying this
is that you definitely don’t have to
be a Classics major to benefit from
this program. Homer, Pindar, Ovid,
Horace, Catullus, Seneca, and
Virgil among others have inspired
generations of English writers.

We heard reports from a phi-
losophy major on the pre-Socratics,
Aristotle, Plato, and visited the stoa

different travellers from Australia,
Britain, France, andGermany. We
ate Greek chicken gyros, bougatza
and tyropita, Turkish delight, Ital-
ian gelato and French baguettes.
We all got intestinal disorders
in Turkey. Tom. We drank Ouzo,
Retsina, Raki, fatty Amstels and
Heinekens, capuccinos and plenty
of Italian and French wine. Our
women lusted after Cretan shep-
herds. The men hit on gorgeous
Italian women and got nowhere,
(except for Lee at Segesta). We
hackey-sacked on the Acropolis.

pickpockets or a sunset behind Greek ruins.

would like to describe the experi-
ence I had with with a group of
sixteen Davidson students and Dr.
Dirk French, head of the Classics
Department.

To begin with, the academics
were rigorous. Dr. French would
want me to mention this. Our
classes were on Greek Civiliza-
tion, Roman Civilization, Greek
and Roman Art & Architecture,

and an independent study, which

varied dependin;, upon the stu-
dent’s major.

I met Americans from other
programs abroad who said what a
joke the work was and whata party
they were having. This was not the
case of our program. Before we
left, we wrote tworesearch papers,
one for Greek Civilization and one

for Roman Civilization.

Onceat the location of the topic
of our papers we gave an oral pres-
entation. Examples of these topics
were “Greek Drama” given at the

theater of Dionysus in Athens, or

(marketplace) in Athens where
stoicism was born.

History majors benefitted from
touring the sites of accounts read
in Thucydides or Tacitus. Reli-
gion majors saw the amphitheater
where Paul preached to the Ephe-
sians, the catacombs outside Rome,
the Vatican, and Istanbul, seat of
both the Christian Holy Roman
Empire and the Islamic Ottoman
Empire.

For Art History majors we
looked at originals of some of the
greatest pieces in the world: the
Parthenon, the two finest existing
Greek full bronze figures, the
Sistine Chapel ceiling, Mich-
elangelo’s “Pieta” and “Ecstasy of
St. Theresa”, the Pantheon, the Pont
du Gard, the Coliseum... You get
the idea: the program offered an
academic challenge and interest-
ing subjects to study.

Meanwhile, we could step
outside for a cultural education.

University and an acomplished
archaeologist. We were up at six
every day following Uz ata break-
neck pace. He knew every detail
of the sites we visited and swamped
us with information. Yet Uz was
coolatall times. He gotusdeals on
food, hotels, and a Turkish bath.
He chain-smoked and drank Jack
Daniels.

After mid-terms in Athens we
were free to do as we pleased for
spring break. Some people went to
Egypt, some to Yugoslavia, and
some to the Greek islands. It was
a relief to break away from the
ordered schedule for ten days.

The group, in my opinion,
learned lot from each other. We
were from different fraternities and
eating houses or independents.
Most of us would never have got-
tento know eachother at Davidson.
We of course got on each other’s
nerves, but shared many good
times. Since returning to school
we’ ve had several slide-shows and
Ouzo slamming parties.

To be objective, there were a
few drawbacks. The broad scope

of the seminar kept us constantly
onthe move. We gained perspec-
tive on the big picture, but some-
times one temple or marble statue
began to look like another.

It was then that we livened
things up and became redneck art
critics and members of the Helms
Morality Police. “That nekkid
man out there like that, now that
ain’t right. Put a damn towell on
that.” Besides spring break, we
had only five free days the entire
semester, So we sometimes wenta
bit stir crazy.

Constant travelling also kept
us from encountering the cultures
we visited on an intimate level. I
think students who spend a full

year inacountry where they speak .

the language have an entirely dif-
ferent experience from this pro-
gram. They have more time and
Capacity to soak in the customs of
the region. This is important to
consider if you are thinking of
going abroad. .

Yet the “Classics Abroad”
experience was amazing and the
drawbacks I accepted as part of it.

The strongest point was that every
day we encountered something
new: train strikes, language barri-
ers, Islamic mosques, pickpockets,
bungled mapreading, or a sunset
behind Greek ruins.

The pace was rigorous and
tempers flared, but fat half-liter
Heinekens and Amstels for only
100 drachmas (60 cents) waited
nearby. We contributed signifi-
cantly to the Dutch economy, be-
lieve me.

Unless the Middle East War
interferes the next seminar will go
in spring of 1992. Hopefully it will,
because it is a priceless educational
experience. I would goagain. Talk
toanyone who wentandmostwould
say the same. It iscommon knowl-
edge that travel and study abroad is
rewarding.

On this program you get four
credits for travelling widely, plus a |
tour guide with a PhD. Hopefully,
anew group will learn some of the
things I have learned. If so, good
luck with Italian women. Belli-
simo. All I ever got was a big fat
“Ciao.”
