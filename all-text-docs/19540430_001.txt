Dr. William Tate Will
Speak af ODK Tap Day

Bill Hood, president of David-
son's Delta Circle of Omicron
Delta Kappa leadership honor
society, recently attended the
Southeastern Province Convention
of ODK. The convention was held
in Atlanta. on the campus of
Georgia Technological Institute on
Friday and Saturday, April 23 and
24.

Principal speaker at the conven-
tion was Dr. Robert Bishop, na-
tional secretary of ODK and editor
of the ODK Cirele. Dr. Bishop is
dean of students at the University
of Cincinnati.

Business sessions and committee
discussions were led and organized
by Dr. William Tate, dean of stu-
dents at the University of Georiga,
and deputy of the Southeastern
Province of ODK. Dr. Tate will
speak at Davidson's ODK spring
tap day ceremonies and initiation
banquet to be held on Tuesday,
May 11.

Growing Organization

An especially interesting part of
the convention program was Dr.
Bishop’s report on the growth of
ODK as a national organization.
The Society was founded at Wash-
ington and Lee University in 1914,
and Davidson's Delta Circle, estab-
lished in 1917, was the fourth circle
in existence. There are now about
80 circles of ODK, most of them
east of the Mississippi.

But recent expansion has been
westward, and installment is now
being planned for circles at the
University of Wyoming and Okla-
homa A. & M. A number of peti-
tions from such schools as_ the

University of Gouthern California ;

are under consideration.

As Dr. Bishop phrased it, “The
‘ODK idea’ has gained acceptance
throughout our nation. At present
the scope of the society is rapidly
expanding, and the admirable suc-
cess of: collegiate circles combined
with recent development in new
areas predicts a brilliant future
for the organization.”

MUSICAL DOUBLE
FEATURE SET FOR

THURSDAY

Irene Jordan Sings
Here This Evening

In a day dominated by specializa-
tion in almost every field, titian-
haired soprano Irene Jordan, who
will sing in Chambers Auditorium
at 8:15 this evening, is that rare
and refreshing phenomenon, a
singer whose specialty is not
specialty but infinite variety.

Miss Jordan, of whom Rochester
Philharmonic Conductor Erich
Leinsdorf said, “Here is the voice
the masters had in mind when they
wrote their operas” may be in the
great classic tradition vocally, but
in streamlined looks and manner
she is strictly twentieth century.

Although she has been compared
to the most memorable European
divas, Miss Jordan is wholly
American in training and _ back-
ground. Born in Birmingham,
Alabama, she was one of ten chil-
dren, all of them musical. Irene
began taking piano lessons when
she was 3% and at college majored
in piano as well as voice.

The result of dedicated effort
from earliest childhood was a per-
fectly trained voice, a successful
Town Hall debut, and immediate
recognition by the Metropolitan.
The day after her audition in 1946,
she received a contract and went
on to sing in Lakme, Boris Godu-
nov, and Cavalleria Rusticana.

In addition to regular opera
repertoire she is known for her
mastery of the soprano roles in
more rarely heard works such as
Mozart’s Titus which had _ its
American premier recently at
Tanglewood. Last winter she was
a brilliant success in the difficult
role of Eglantine in Weber's
Euryanthe.

Highlights of Irene Jordan's
concert in Davidson will be “Have
You Seen But a Whyte Lilie Grow,”
a group of German Lieder by
Richard Strauss and Wolfe, “In the
Silence of Night” by Rachmaninoff,
and arias from operas by Verdi and
Mozart.

Students will be admitted to the
concert upon presentation of their
identification cards.

ternity, initiated into its ranks six

by Joe Key, DeWitt Helm, and
Maurice Crouse.

ment period was held. Officers for
next year were elected. They are:

Joyner, first vice president; Bobby
Joe Key, second vice president, and
Maurice Crouse, secretary.

Popular. Jazz King Louis Armstrong

Wil Raise Roof On Chambers May 6

The one and only Louis “Satch-
mo” Armstrong, the world’s jazz
king, will play at Davidson the
night of May 6. The program is
sponsored by the Inter-Fraternity
Council.

Armstrong was born on July 4,
1900. When he was twelve years
old, he got into a jam which turned
out to be a blessing in disguise. He
was sent to a reform school for
shooting his father’s 38 caliber
fistol into the air. .

While at the “Colored Waif’s
Home for Boys,” the captain in
charge taught him how to play,

first, the bugle, and next, the];

cornet. Louis took the old pawn
shop cornet home with him.

At fourteen he began playing as
a fill-in on irregular jobs. To sup-
port himself he sold newspapers,
worked in a dairy and delivered
coal.

While doing odd jobs for King
Oliver, he attracted this famous

P

LOUIS ARMSTRONG

musician’s attention. Oliver taught
Louis to read notes and gave him
lessons.

In 1917 he played for Kid Ory’s
band, and a few years later he

played on the riverboats plying the
Mississippi between New Orleans
and Memphis. During this time
Armstrong began to compose his
own music. In 1922 he started
working for Oliver as his second
cornet player.

Louis began to make a name

‘|for himself in the late twenties.

He organized his own band, which
was a small group called Louis
Armstrong's Hot Five. It was later
expanded to the Hot Seven. Dur-
ing this time he changed from
@ cornet to a trumpet and added
singing to his program.

He has made numerous record-
ings, among which some of the
greatest are ‘Potato Head Blues”
and “Poor Butterfly.” Old Satch
has made several trips to Europe
where he was received with
enthusiasm He was -recently
elected to Music’s Hall of Fame,
an honor that seemed to be long
overdue.
