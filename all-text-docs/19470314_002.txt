We Have Failed -
Can You Carry On?

With the beginning of Spring Election
next week we come suddenly to the realiza-
tion of how little time is left in the school
year, and how much less time there is
before the heads of the campus organiza-
tions and student body officers will be
turning over their positions to their .suc-
cessors from the present junior class.
It seems fitting at this time, therefore,
that we review the work and accomplish-
ments of the retiring seniors,

The present senior class, made up al-
most entirely of ex-G.I.’s, has a higher
percentage of veterans than any other
class. However, the significant fact is not
so much that this class is composed almost
wholly of veterans for the other classes
have many to be sure — but that these
were the ones who had been at Davidson
hefore the war, who knew the old David-
son, its spirit, its traditions, its customts.

While We Were Gone
No one will deny that ‘these important
elements of the Davidson life were. de-
finitely weak, if not entirely lacking, in
the wartime Davidson with its student
body reaching a low of 150. For this no
one is to blame. The regular student body
was replaced almost entirely and ina very
short time by students who did not have
the opportunity to Know the Davidson
‘Spirit and tradition in the only way it
can be know — from the older students
who have in turn learned from students
before them. These students. having been
at Davidson, in many cases, for hardly a
year, were placed in positions of leader-
ship with none of this background. — Tt

could have been no other way.

Now That We’re Back

But with the return of these men who
were supposed to have and to know these
traditions and spirit, many began to hope
that they would bring them back with
them to make the better Davidson that
used to be. And there is no reason, such
being possible, why they should not bring
them back to Davidson, for there is hard-
ly an organization on the campus which
is not headed by-a-veteran, a veteran who
was here before the war,

No one will deny that these important
elements of the Davidson life are defin-
itely weak, if not entirely lacking, in the
post. war Davidson. Why has the senior
class failed? Why have these men not been
able, assuming they have tried, to re-
capture the Davidson spirit which has

marked Davidson men wherever they have
gone and which, there is no little evidence,
will not long be associated with Davidson
if present trends persist.

No doubt part of the answer lies in the
fact that, as Dr. Chalmers Davidson so
wbly pointed out, the student body is too
large, and students have not had the op-
portunity to know each other as in a nor-
mat year. These important factors are
necessary for even the best efforts of the
best leadership. Also, much of the en-
thusiasm which has inspired past leaders
was left on the battlefields — many things
once important in extra-curricula activities
now seem trivial. Others find that family
responsibilities must necessarily become of
tirst importance, while others. feel that
they are becoming too old and must con
centrate all of their efforts on graduating
at the earliest possible time.

After We've Left

But this is not an attempt to excuse our
class for a job poorly done. What concerns
us now is not why have we failed, but
what will be the means of recovering the
Davidson spirit with. the
pearance of those in. whom hope for re-
covery has been placed..We, in this office,
are. not among those so naive as to be-

rapid... disap-

lieve that such things& will come about
automatically with the return (and we hope
it will return) of the student body to pre-
war size, or. even with the disappearance
of the veterans. Such could never ‘be the
case by the very nature of spirit, almost
by definition.

But perhaps we have painted the picture
too darkly. Perhaps we can claim for our
class not total failure, only partial failure.
Itor there are.some who, though never
having known the true Davidson firsthand,
realize that this is not such a Davidson and
are concerned. that we should regain it.
The picture will also be lightened when we
consider that there still remain in the un-
lerclasses some who were here before the
war.

Such men as these we hope will be clected
to lead the student body for the coming
year. nd to such men, whether in’ posi-
tions of leadership of not, we extend the
challenge to regain the true Davidson.

We have failed—

Can you carry on?

Letters To The
Editor....

Dear Editor :-

In consideration of Doug Swink’s letter
to the editor in the Davidsonian February
28, may I say that as regards his reasons
for the continuation of “Scripts ’n Pranks”
I agree wholeheartedly with all of them ex-
cept the fifth, which he “hesitated in put-
ting forth.” Its application to the question
is ambiguous. Interpreting it tomean_that
some articles in the magazine will he print-
ed evidence of the “stored up exuberance”
in. men between 19 and 25 years. of age,
which “will quite often be on the borderline
and may at times step over that undefined
fence between the conventional and the
unconventional,” 1 offer pbjection. T was
not_ proud and eager to show off the first
copy of the magazine as an example of
Davidson's best attempts at literary crea-
tion or as “invaluable advertisement” for
our-college.-Cegtainly the magazine pre-
sents a fine opportunity as a_ proving’
ground for student writers, but let it also
be a publication of good, clean humor and
worthy serious literature of which every
Davidsonian may be proud.

Sincerely yours,

JOHN MILLER,

BETA THETA PI

Queens seems to have been the
main grounds for week-end opera-
tions by the sons of the dragon.
Seen going into the auditorium to
see Pirates of Penzance Saturday
night was brother Frank Rawley,
without date. Seen coming out of
the-same_place two hours later was
Frank Rawley, with date. He saves
more money that way! Numerous
other “wheels” were there, but none
were as successful as “the chief.”

Biggest deal of the week—the
trip to Washington by brothers
which didn’t come off: quite right.
Scruggs, Ellington, and Upchurch
The “Duke” made’ it up there, but
Scruggs and Upchurch got bogged
down in Virginia. They claim the
snow prevented further progress,
but it may have been~that~they
were progressing too well in Vir-
ginia.

Brother Scarborough, Jr., has re-
quested that this column print no
more of his various nefarious deeds,
so we won't tell about his trip to
Winthrop this week end, or the pro-
posed trip to Lynchburg the next.

PI KAPPA PHI
Pi Kappa Phi is glad to weleome
into their midst new pledge, Stuart
Yandle of Charlotte, N.C. Reviews
evidently didn’t scare the Pi
Kapp dealers during this week as
Brothers Cline, Edwards, and Cox
toured to Statesville to help cele-
brate a wedding anniversary. Bro-
thers Shenck, Thad and Jack Bar-
ringer, and Ned Everett toured
to Queens Friday night for dates.
Brothers Lander, Rush, and Houck
had bad luck as far as the date sit-
uation went that night. Which one
is bad luck? With reviews over
til Monday the boys packed up and
took off for various select places.
Fitz to see “Tootie”’, Bill Robert-
son to see Billy Rose, Thad and
Jack Barringer to Florence,
and Warrent Higgenbothan honte:
Brother Evans journeyed to Ran-
dolph Macon to keep a blind date.
Brothers Dobson, Cox, Edwards
and Sasser escorted their ladies
around Charlotte Saturday night.
Brother Lander spent his time at
Queens dating and gathering scan-
dal. Best scene of the week goes
to: Charlie Reid, who spent Sat.
night moaning at an unmentionable
place for Lucy. Brother Herb John-
son minding Prof. Will’s baby and
getting an A at the same time.
Let’s watch that nose Herb.
S. P._E. en

Brother Winchester’ journeyed
northward with the expressed pur-
pose of attending the basketball
tournament, but on his off time he
attempted to knit the outlying chap-
ters of the fraternity into the close
friendship for which they are noted.

Fearless Fred Abernathy loaded
up on courage and ventured out
into the cold night common to the
female institution in a neighboring
hamlet last Friday night. We fol-
low his progress with fearful an-
ticipation. The Wart, on the bounce,
is looking for a good detective to
find an old flame in the Queen City.
May we Suggest the fire depart-
ment? ;

Since the mountains cannot come
to Lacy, Lacy might go to the
mountains. Good idea, mebbe!
Heard a little joke over the week
end: Sarah went for a ride in
Harry’s car, what went on she ain’t
admittin’, but what she’s knittin’
ain’t for Britain.

Scruggs, in his weekly ‘trip to
Winthrop, had quite a bit of trouble
with the local authorities. Seems
she thought they should be spend-
ing more money for electricity.

PI KAPPA ALPHA

Celebrating the near end of the
review period seemed to Hrompt Pi
Kappa Alpha’s members to go hog
wild. Brother Dickson, using
birthday as an excuse, journeyed to
the hills, and from all reports got
several gifts, the nature of which
he refused to disclose. Brother
Stroup (Bob) headed south again
--Cowpens, that is. Greensboro

was graced by the presence of two

|

of Pika’s better known wheels,
Brothers Shelton and Clark, while

Brothers Lee and Gallant chose
Charlotte for their amusement.

Rapid Robert Smoak and Double
Dip McNair went skiing in the
mountains but Brother Rogers pick-
ed the climate of Kannapolis for
the week end. Brother Reese also
went home, as did Brother Mills.
Reports of these escapades have not
yet reached the campus, and the
culprits declined to elaborate. Dock-
ery journeyed to Statesville, and
from all reports is now seeing Dots
before his eyes. On campus were:
Turner, Gibbs, Hart, and Anderson.
(I hope.)
KAPPA ALPHA

The gay Knights of Sigma Chap-
ter have a gib, red ricle around
March 22 for that is the date of
the Spring function: Plans are
shaping up for one of the biggest
affairs in the social year. Festivi-
ties will begin in the early evening
with a buffet-banquet and then the
dealers will shift the scene of action
to the dance floor. All this will
take place at the Morris Field Of-
ficers’ Club with music by Billy
Knauf and orchestra,

Although the Wildcats didn’t get
a well-deserved bid to the confer-
ence tournament, several brothers
were on hand for the important
event. “Sports” Ervin, Paul Rich-
ardson, and Bill Byrd journeyed up
Thursday and were joined by Chuck
Cunningham. on- Friday. Another
Knight was seen at Durham but
displayed no interest in the basket-
ball frolics—hmmm. ,

Brother Bud Towle and Pledge
Skeets Howard pulled up their land-
ing gear Saturday a. m. with Wash-
ington (N. C.) their destination.

Operating from a sleek Packard
Clipper, Brother Glenn braved the
week-end weather to go sailing,
but had to settle with simple fish-
ing—what a Tine.

Our newest pledge is Jack Haz-
ard who hails fronrdown in Jack-
sonville, Fla.

SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON

Happy birthday to us!! Sunday,
March 9, S. A. E. was 91 year's old!
A special appearance of Haley’s
Comet (pulling an S. A. E. pen-
nant) was on order, but due to
the overeast it was not visible.
Sparks flew elsewhere, however.
That streak you saw wasn‘t the
comet but meteorite Hockey Lee,
giving the P-82’s a hard run _ to
Durham in his faithful Torpedo.
Says he saw a basketball game.

The steins tinkle for Brother
Meatball Gambrell who is heading
for military fame. He is now an
able bodied corporal. Anticipating
sarcasm, he has said, “Look at Gen.
Eisenhower!” Of course this does
not have a'thing to do with it, but
isn’t it touching?

Bob: Strickland needs a small
chain to string across his vest. He
returned from Washington, D. C.,
and many important “cabinet”
meetings with an honorary mem-
bership in the “Golden Key” Club,
for which he has received a badge.

“Now, Jake, you and George be
good!’-Ashmore and Grimball were
off in a cloud to Greenville on the
Saturday shipment. When they are
revived we'll get the gruesome de-
tails.

There is a copy of “That Girl
from Memphis” at the house. Will
Dick Port please drop-by and pick
it up at his earliest convenience?

MARCH 17-18

“THE PERFECT MARRIAGE”

David Niven and Loretta Young,
on their tenth wedding anniversary
finally decide that the old spark has
gone out of their marriage. They
admit they do not care for the
other’s parents, and among other
irritating things Loretta continues
as fashion editor. David makes a
pass at another woman (Virginia
Field) and Loretta is wined and
dined by Eddie Albert. However
Cookie Norma Griffith), the child,
manages to keep Mommy and Dad-
dy together and all ends well.

WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY
MARCH 19-20

“ABIE’S IRISH ROSE” ———

Conflict begins when Rosemary
Murphy’s and Abe Levy’s respect-
ive fathers fail to allow the joining
of the two children in marriage.

Knowing that his father holds no
special love for the Irish, Abie per-
suades Rosemary to keep their mar-
riage a secret until his father learns
to love her. Human interest appeal
runs high and comedy is well han-

dled. The cast includes Joanne
Dru, Richard Norris, Michael Chek-
hov, and George E. Stone.

FRIDAY AND SATURDAY
MARCH 21-22

“THE SHOW OFF”

Another Red Skelton movie which
affords him with as much room in
which to frolic about as have his
past ones. The plot concerns a city
show-off who marries into an
American middle class family and

is slowly overwhelmed by financial

and social obligations. A rich live-
ly comedy itself to any Red Skelton
fan. Others in the cast are Marilyn
Maxwell, Marjorie Maen, Virginia
O’Brien, and “Rochester” Anderson. ;

PHI GAMMA DELTA

The author’s BUSINESS trip to
Richmond and an abnormal secret-
ness evidenced by the brothers who
fear their innocence may be shat-
tered in word as well as in deed
resulted in absolutely no recordable
actions over the past week end.
Monday night Brother Fireplug
spent the evening composing a pre-
liminary history of the chapter, as
follows:

A Gentle Knight was pricking (1)
on the plaine,

Y-cladd in mightie armes. and sil-
ver shielde, .

So pure and innocent he did e’er
remaine,

Despite the awful dens where he
had dealed, (2)

That by the name Elyea he was
yelept. (3

Efstoones a lovely ladie he did spie,

And forthwith from his charger he
y-lept,

To fondle gently her licentious
toyes (4)

And kisse her gracefully upon the
eye.

There in the shade, after long *
wanton joyes, ‘ .

Withe pleasante dreames he soon
y-slept.

Thinking how much better than to
listen to boring speeches.

At length upon his beaste (5) he
back y-crept

And rode with ever-quickening pace,

Toward long-sought goal, a quiet /
drinking place, Z

Where, guzzling, he fell flat upon
his face.
