German politician gives view of U.S-Soviet relations

By MARK CHEN

This past week, German Mar-
shall Fund Visiting Fellow
Freimut Duve visited the David-
son campus. While here, Duve
lectured on “Coexistence: the
German Experience” and “Ger-
man Intellectuals in Politics.” Be-
sides these official gatherings,
Duve has visited many classes,
talking with and answering ques-
tions from students,

Besides being a scholar, Duve
is also an active politician in his
native West Germany. A member
of the Social Democratic party,
Duve represents a district in Ham-
burg in the Bundestag, the Ger-
man parliament. Furthermore, he
is the editor of the Social Democ~
ratic publishing press, turning out
a number of pamphlets and books
yearly. From journalism to
policymaking, Herr Duve’s ac-*
tivities embrace a number of
areas.

These areas have led Duve toa
number of observations about the
state of U.S.-Soviet relations. Ina
talk to Dr. Edmondson’s class on
Twentieth-Century Russia, he
emphasized what he saw as the
differences between German and
American views of the SOviet

Under the new leadership of
sophomore Julie Mayfield,
Davidson’s Amnesty  Interna-
tional organization has a full
agenda this spring and encourages
active participation by all inter-
ested students and faculty. AI, ac-
‘cording to its literature, “is a
worldwide movement which is in-
dependent of any government,
political . faction, ideology,
economic interest, or religious
creed. It plays a specific role with-
in the overall spectrum of human
rights work.”

The organization’s activities
are centered around three objec-
tives. First, AI “seeks the release
of men and women detained any-
where for their beliefs, color, sex,
ethnic origin, language, or reli-
gion, provided they have neither
used nor advocated violence.

These are termed ‘Prisoners of

Union. “You Americans must un-
derstand that we share many val-.
ues. We don’t share a lot of values
with the history of. Russia....We
do share history, but we don’t
share much history with the
United States.”

While Germany and _ the
Soviet Union are far apart on
many issues, they share the com-
mon experience of war and suffer-
ing. Duve was born in 1936 and he
remembers staying in bombshel-
ters while buildings outside were
burning. The American experi-
ence, however, is of sending
fathers and sons off to fight in for-
eign wars. While Germans and
Russians have had to cope with
the immediacy of war, Americans
have debated between involve-
ment in and isolation from world
affairs. :

This historical experience has
meant a difference in American,
German, and Russian views of
war. For Européans, war is a liv-
ing memory. For Americans, war
is something for which they plan
and . prepare. Duve — sharply
criticized the present administra-
tion for its talk of the Soviet Union
as an “Evil Empire.” He insisted
that the Soviet Union, with its

Conscience.’” Second, “it advo-
cates fair and early trials of all
political prisoners and works on
behalf of such persons detained
without: charge or without trial.
Finally, AI’s third focal point is
the opposition to “the death pen-
alty and torture or other cruel, in-
human or degrading treatment or
punishment of all prisoners with-.
out reservations.”

It is important to dispel all
misconceptions of AI’s purposes

and activities. In a campus news- .

letter, AI wrote that “Amnesty
groups and members have often
been accused of having a hidden
political agenda. In this country,

Amnesty is most likely to be -

labeled ‘liberal’ or even ‘com-
munist’ . . . . In other countries, -
the label might be just the oppo-
site.” However, Amnesty Interna-
tional insists on their indepen-
dence “of any political ideology or

memory of war, does not want to
change the status quo through war
measures. Superpower rivalry is a
misconception of history, one for
which the world may have to pay.
“That is the basic lesson a German
politician can give to American
students.”

Duve also looked at changes
in the Soviet Union which he be-
lieves will affegt this rivalry. Re-
cently, Mikhail Gorbachev, the
General Secretary of the Soviet
Union, gave a speech to his Cen-
tral Committee. In this speech he
repeated the need for democrati-
zation and warned that 205 of its
members, appointed during the
years of Brezhnev, should resign
their posts in favor of younger
men. Though not optimistic about
change in the Soviet Union, Duve

. believes that strong pressures are

leading Gorbachev in the direc-
tion of reform.

Duve laid the strongest em-
phasis on what he believed were
the mistaken attitudes of the
United States toward the Soviet
Union. “If the most powerful na-
tion in world has these views, then
it is detrimental to European-
American friendship and other
things.”

group.”

At Davidson, students and
faculty may become involved
with AI’s activities by writing let-
ters and attending lectures, films
and videos on issues such as-tor-
ture and the death penalty. The na-

‘tional organization sends schools
like Davidson, who have a Cam-
pus Network, Urgent Actions,

- ‘which outline AI’s concerns about

specific prisoners of conscience.

Then, interested students write

letters and cards to foreign gov-
ernment officals, seeking the re-
lease of these persons.

On April 7, AI will conduct a
letter writing concerning several
students in Iraq who are believed
to have been killed because of
their parents’ political beliefs.
This spring the organization will
show a video on the Death Penalty
followed .by a discussion. AI is

that it is difficult to evaluate Al’s

Davidson pool must meet safety regulations

By DAVID WILLIAMS

To comply with a local ordi-
nance passed two years ago, the
athletic department has recently
decided to do away with the
“buddy system” at the swimming
pool and has hired certified stu-
dents to lifeguard the pool during
periods of “open-swim.” The ath-
letic department has appropriated
$1500 from its physical education
budget to cover the cost of having
lifeguards at the pool during the

remainder of spring term.

Physical Education Director
Sterling Martin said that until re-
cently athletic department. offi-

cials were “‘not aware of” the 1985
ordinances passed by. Mecklen-
burg County, which require that
pools exceeding five feet in depth
and more than 800 square feet in
surface area have a lifeguard on
duty at all times the pool is open.

Martin said that about three

years ago several athletic depart- |

ment members had expressed the
concern that opening the pool
without lifeguards on duty was
“taking too much of achance.” He
said the department members be-
lieved lifeguards were necessary
for the safe operation of the pool

“not only because of the possibil-
ity of negligence,” but also be-
cause lifeguards would be better
equipped to save a life in case a
swimmer were to suffer a life-

. threatening __ physical ___problem |

while in the pool.

But Martin said budget con-
straints had forced the athletic de-
partment to continue with the
“buddy” system at the pool during
hours of “open swim.” Under the
buddy system, swimmers were re-
quired to swim in groups of at
least two. The buddy system had

been in operation at the pool for at

least thirty years.

~ Martin said the athletic depart-
ment.a few years ago asked its in-
surance company about the col-
lege’s liability with regard to its
swimming pool operations under
the buddy system. “Their opinion,
at that point, was that we were
nearly as liable with a lifeguard or
without,” Martin said. “So we de-
cided at that point that, in order to
keep the pool open the number of
hours that people wanted it avail-
able, we would operate on the
buddy system.”

However, Martin said that
with lifeguards at the pool the col-

adds that “every prisoner that |
have worked with through the
Adoption Group has been re-
leased.” Despite the difficulty in
determining Al's effectiveness,
he said that the organization
“creates a consciousness of
human rights.” AI’s effectiveness
is furthur demonstrated by the fact

‘that it received the 1977 Nobel

Peace Prize.
- As for his goals as the faculty _
advisor for Davidson’s_ AI,

Sabaratnum said “in the short run,
it is to get more people active and
to create more awareness of
human rights issues.” “Also, in -
the next few years,” he said, “we
want to get more faculty in-
volved.” He added that he would
also like for students and faculty
members to give talks around
Davidson in order to increase the
community’s participation in the
organization.

lege will face a substantially smal-
ler chance of being sued for negli-
gence in case of a drowning or
other accident at the pool. “Unfor-
tunately, in the current society,
it’s very common to sue at the
drop of a hat,” he said. “We cer-
tainly wouldn’t expect that, but
negligence is negligence.”

Martin said has been success-
ful at finding enough water safety
instructors and advanced
lifeguards certified by the Red
Cross to man the pool for its
nearly fifty hours per week of
open swim. “We have filled all the
slots except two,” he said.
