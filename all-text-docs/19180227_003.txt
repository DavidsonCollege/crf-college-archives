AMERICAN UNIVERSITY CLUB
OF CHINA HAS 300 MEMBERS.

The American University Club of
China is composed of nearly three hun-
dred graduates and former students of
American. Universities, who are now liv.
ing in China. “The membership is about
equally divided between Chinese grad:
uates of American Universities who have
returned home’ to China, and of Amer
icans who are engaged in the various
business, educational, medical and mis-
sionary enterprises that Americans are
conducting in the Republic of China.

‘Phe club was organized in 1903 and
the membership has grown steadily. The
purpose of the club is to stimulate a
closer feeling of fellowship on the part of
American college men who are living in
China and also stimulate a closer fellow-
ship) among Americans and Chinese
which is so necessary to the future peace
and well being of the Pacific.

Approximately 1.200 Chinese gradu-
ates and. former students of American
and Europeon Universities have now re-
turned to China. More than half of
this number have been educated in Amer-
ica and their records since returning to
China show that their education has not
been in vain. In practically every line
of endeavor in China. engineering, rail-
road management, manufacturing, edu-
cation. medicine. business, and govern-
mental service they are to be found in
positions of trust and responsibility.

There are now about 7,000 Americans
living in China and the last few years
has seen a great stimulus in the growth
of American business and other interests
in China. Since China is now being
rapidly modernized along Western or
American lines the American University
Club desires to emphasize the importance
of a closer study of questions dealing
with the Far East on the part of Amer-
ican colleges and universities. Tt also
desires to call the attention of Amer-
ican young men and women to the possi-
bility of becoming of service to America
thru a closer study of*world-wide affairs
and questions, especially those dealing
with the Far East.

American college students or profes-
sors desiring special information on sub-

State. The essays must be written on

The  Technique--Colonel Hubbard.
the commandant at Georgia Tech., took
about cixty students to Camp Gordon.
The object was to see the trenches, ar-
tillery and other features. At division
headquarters they were met by two of-
ficers of the French Army, who took
the party all over the trenches and ex-
plained every feature of the trench sys-
tem. Rain overhead and mud underfoot
added a vivid touch of reality and only
the hiss of shells and enemy aeroplanes
were lacking to make the picture com
plete.
