Should I stay or should I go?

minors to the academic course of-
ferings.

The Baker family donated $2.5
million for the new Life Sciences
building. Their gift was one of the
150 top donations made in the coun-
try last year.

Women’s soccer continued
their outright domination of the
Southern Conference by winning
the tournament for the third year in
a row, and the football team had a
its first winning season in years,
finishing 6-4.

Time was set aside for the ob-
servation of Martin Luther King Jr.
Day in the academic year, but the
Veteran’s Day proposal was a casu-
alty.

The Habitat House now dots
the Davidson landscape.

It was a $40,000 project fi-
nanced largely by $20 donations
from College members and the
town.

Christmas came, and the cam-
pus threw its annual party and ...
some condoms. Santa gave more
than candy canes this year.

Spring semester began with
eight returning juniors entering a
new dormitory on Concord Road.
Unfortunately, half of them had to
leave a few weeks later. A town
zoning law allows a maximum of
four members in a similar organiza-
tion to live together.

Warren Buford left his produc-
tive year at the SGA’s helm and

Buster Burk danced on in to begin
his own. Burk ran a campaign of
promising an open ear to everyone,
and vowed to make Davidson a
better place in whatever way he
can.

Members of the Davidsoncom-
munity tragically left us this year.
Sophomore Jason Koyasu was
killed in an automobile accident.
Chairman of the Board of Trustees,
and generous friend of the College,
Craig Wall passed away.

The Trustees voted to let
women enter Belk and Little Dorms.

The men’s basketball team fin-
ished an improbable season at 18-9,
surprising everyone except Coach
McKillop and themselves. They
lost in the Southern Conference
semifinals. The women’s basket-
ball team played tough all year,
losing a close game in the SC
quarterfinals. The promise both
these young teams showed
SHOULD develop into winning
seasons next year.

The year ended with a series of
unanswered, important questions.
Will the Humanities program stay
as itis? Will the College’s current
tuition benefit plan remain in tact?
And, most pressing: Who will be
the next President?

Graduation and the year’s end
will bring their own share of
changes. President Kuykendall will
bid farewell to the senior class and
his office. Graduation will have left
its old spot in front of the Life
Sciences building and take place in
front of Chambers.
