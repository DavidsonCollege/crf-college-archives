NUMBER 6

New building guarantees class of 1995 senior apartments

By Mary McCrory

Ninety members of the junior class will
be livingit up next year. If all goes well, they
will be the first to live in the newest addition
to the Martin Court apartments.

Since spring of last year, the Future
Student Housing Committee has met weekly
to discuss the site, design, and floor plans of
what may be called Building F.

At the Trustees' meeting Friday, they
gave approval to begin construction.
Groundbreaking could begin in December
or January.

Staff members of the Future Student
Housing Committee include Residence Life
Director Richard Terry, Physical Plant Di-
rector Robert Collins, Facilities and Hous-
ing Operations Coordinator Debby Sink,
and Staff Architect Susan Pfahl. SGA Liai-
sonto RLO and Junior President B.J. Rudell

appointed juniors Christine Heitzenroder,
Charles Raynal, Catherine Rivenbark, and
Sara Withers to serve as student members of
the committee.

After much deliberation, the group has
settled on a plan for 5 bedroom apartments
across the street from Building D, on a
grassy area now used as a practice field.

This site was selected over others largely
because of student response toa poll distrib-
uted by the committee in the Union and
Chambers.

According to Rudell, students preferred
this site to one near Irwin, Knox and Akers.
Although the poll may not have reached
everyone, Rudell was pleased to use student
input. “Nothing makes me happier than
knowing that not just the elected students
but all the students are dictating ated on
campus,” he says.

Committee member Christine
Heitzenroder sees the proximity to Martin
Court as one advantage to this site.

“I think the area will reap a large sense
of community. One of the things the com-
mittee is concerned about is not dividing the
seniors into groups” she says.

Although physically very close to the
Buildings A-E, the exterior design of the
new building will not copy the design of the
present apartments. The new building will
be similar in shape to Belk dormitory, with
three floors and acentral elevator to reach all
6 apartments per floor.

Nomore going downstairs then up again
to visit people who live on the same floor but
on the other side of the building. The com-
mittee and architects also hope to foster a
sense of community on each floor since
everyone will share balcony space.

In addition to the 6 apartments per floor,
the second and third floors will also have
two 30'X 30' meeting rooms to be used for
group gatherings, and possibly to house
international students over Christmas break.

Plans for the interior of the apartments
have not been finalized. However, the bed-
rooms will probably be roughly the same
size as Martin Court bedrooms, with closets
as opposed to wardrobes and an L-shaped
kitchen to increase work space.

“Half of the fun of having an apartment
is cooking dinner,” Christine Heitzenroder
explains.

The committee chose the 5. bedroom
plan because they hope to keep costs down
to about $2 million. Having 5 people in an
apartment is more economical because it

Eating disorders infecting DC females.

By Kristin Garris

A panel discussion concern-
ing eating disorders was sponsored
by the Committee for Women’s
Issues on Monday, October 4. Five
students, a counselor from the Stu-
dent Health Center, and the dieti-
cian for Vail Commons were par-
ticipants on the panel.

Nance Longworth, a counse-
lor at Davidson, gave an introduc-
tion in which she defined the vari-
ous eating disorders—anorexia,
bulimia, and compulsive over-eat-
ing. She included alarming statis-
tics of how many people are af-
fected by eating disorders. Dieti-

cian Julie Newman then spoke
about the services she offers. Three
panel members spoke of personal
experiences with anorexia, obses-
sions with counting calories and
with their body images.

The psychological aspects of
eating disorders were emphasized
throughout the discussion. Panel
members expressed concern that
not enough attention is given tothe
underlying emotional catalysts for
eating disorders.

Manipulation of food may be
used as a way to avoid or deal with
emotional problems; a common
response from people with eating

disorders is that they felt a lack of
control in their lives.

The long-term psychological,
emotional, and harmful physical
ramifications of eating disorders
were talked about. One panel mem-
ber stated that she will never be
comfortable with food or have a
normal appetite again.

The discussion also focused
on the problem of eating disorders
specifically at Davidson. Students
spoke of the “contagious” effects,
on freshman halls and in eating
houses especially, of obsessions
with weight, calories, fat content
of foods, and exercise.
