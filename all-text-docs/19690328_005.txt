Lefty Was A Winner

His name sounds like that of a pitcher for the
Yankees or a country and Western musical star. His
Southern manner of speaking and his very obvious
ears do nothing to change this impression.

But Charles (Lefty) Driesell is neither. Instead
the big balding Virginia native was—and may very
well still be—one of the most successful collegiate
basketball coaches in the country.

Driesell took over the Davidson head coaching
job nine years ago when it was badly in need of a
transfusion. To the surprise of nearly everyone con-
cerned, the delight of Wildcat students and alumni
and the chagrin of many coaches, Lefty quickly turned
a mediocre-to bad team of pre-ministerials into a na-
tionally ranked and respected squad of potential All-
Americans.

On the surface, it appeared to be straight out of
the storybook, with Driesell and his prized recruits,
Fred Hetzel, Dick Snyder, Mike Maloy, and all the
rest, racking up win after win, championship after
championship in conference and tourney play. How-
ever, as the man said, things just weren’t what. they
seemed to be.

Despite the wins, the cheers, the successes, and
the honors, it wasn’t a complete bed of roses for Drie-
sell or his players. In fact, severa) thorns had sprouted.

First, Driesell tended to emphasize the worst as-
pects of his personality for the cause of winning,
bringing on conflict with certain members of the
‘faculty, administration and alumni of Davidson, as
well as alienating: many of the members of the press
from his cause to promote and build Wildcat basket-
ball. During the early years of Davidson’s success on
the hardcourt, Driesell actually resorted to the un
heard of act of calling the newspapers to give inter-
views.

At one point, the controversial Driesell had to be
called down by the college president because of his
aggressive, high-handed and often disrespectful atti-
tude. This failed to affect Lefty, however, as he de-
veloped one of the most colorful coaching styles in
the country with his fist-waving, hand-clapping, foot-
stomping, high-kicking rampages. .

The biggest problem that Driesel] faced as David-
son’s head mentor, however, came from within the
team itself. It is no secret to Davidson students that
Lefty never was in any position to be elected by his
players as “Mr. Personality” or “Nice Guy of. the
Year” or ‘Most Popular.” In short, Driesell, although
respected, never did gain any affection from the ma-
jority of his players.

For example, one of Lefty’s stars several years
ago continually cracked jokes in the huddles at time-
outs during a game. Another member of one of Lefty's
teams wrote scathing attacks in a Northern newspaper
upon graduation. Indeed, this season one. player re
portedly offered Driesell a tankful of gas in the new
Thunderbird if Lefty’d only use it to. drive to Mary-
land and stay. Not the type thing one would do out
of affection.

And yet Driesetl still won. and kept on winning,
all the way up to the finals of the’ Eastern Regionals
this year, giving Davidson its highest ranked (third
in one poll) team and most successful ever.

Therefore, one thing about Driesell remains for-
ever certain: Lefty was a winner, and gave to David-
son some great basketball teams.

One of Driesell’s close friends is Red Auerbach,
former head coach of the then-World Champion Bos-
ton Celtics. Auerbach may have understood Driesell at
Davidson better than anyone else.

“Lefty was a hard worker, a real dedicated guy.
Sure, he may have been doing it for his own interest.
It was his duty to win, so he did it the best way that
he knew how. I’ve learned one definite thing about
Driesell; he’s definitely a winner.’

One thing about Driesell’s tenure at Davidson
seemed to have griped Auerbach, however. “I have
three of his boy in summer camp, three of his best
players. They are always talking about Lefty, com-
plaining about him. At the same time I’m getting let-
ters from Driesell, telling me to get them summer jobs,
and that sort of thing.

“Here's a coach working for his boys and they
don’t appreciate it. I know that he’s got his own in-
terest at heart— they win for him—but he’s doing
the right thing. As a winner, I put my money on Drie-
sell.”

The legend of Lefty will grow through the years,
both in its good aspects and its bad. Yet one thing
will always remain a true and essential part of the
story. Lefty Driesell was a winner, and there is no
beating a winner.

‘Lesser’ Sports Hurting Without Money

By BOB WALLACE
Sports Writer
(Third In A Series)

This last week marked the
transition in Davidson life
from the bizarre winter and
almost frantic frenzy over
the Wildcat roundballers to
the calm of sring and apathy
toward five of ‘the other’’
sports at Davidson College.

To Coach Tom Stevens.
though, these last weeks in
the college calendar mean a
change from swimming brief
and towel to baseball togs
and warm-up jacket. as
stroke no longer means a
powerful arm -pull but an
even swing of the bat.

“Every school we play has
baseball scholarships, ex-
cept possibly George Mason.
They even have them in the
Carolina's Conference, ‘‘stat-
ed Stevens. He added quite
forcibly: ““Why, in the South.
ern Conference we have 16
games, and each of these
schools have tong standing
subsidation programs. It's
hard for me to compete
against this only on a boy's
desire,”

He went on to add. that in
swimming it is a bit easier,
since fewer schools have
financial support in this
sport, but he was quick to
emphasize that East Caro-
lina has shown what could
happen if more Southern
Conference schools subsidiz-
ed swimming.

“I've come to the conclu-
sion,” said Stevens, “that
the only difference between
the so called major and min-
or sports is who gets the
money for scholarships.”

On this basis it is there-
fore safe to assume that the
Davidson nine represent a
minor sport against ‘big
timers. Or is it?

Commenting on this. Coach

‘Stevens said. ‘“My boys are

out there every day practic-
ing just as hard as the next
fellow. yet some athletes
are paid and some are not.
The ironic thing is, if a boy
needs financial. aid he is
working an hour or so each
day along with ball prac.
tice.”

Coach Stevens’ main com.
plaint. however, lies pre

-dominantly within the realm

of the admissions policy, or
rather the lack of any set
policy.

“I get a boy fired up over
Davidson, yet I'm not even
sure if he'll be accepted.
What I mean is that my ma-
gor recruiting tool is David-
son's fine education, but 1
can't even go to the admis-
sions office with a boy's
transcript and find out if he
can be accepted or not."

Stevens went on to add
that a special allowance
program, as existing in the
“point system" for basket-
bali and football. would be
nice. but he'd gladly settle
for just the foreknowledge
of whether a boy’s academic
record is good enough for
admittance.

“Another unfair practice
is the school's policy regard-
ing automobiles and financi
al) aid.’ added = Stevens.
‘Here’s a boy in another
sport. who has a car, while
a boy playing for me works
jist as hard. gets far less
glory. and if he’s on financial
aid is not allowed to have

Driesell’s Departure Leaves

Head Coaching Job Unsure

Basketball coach Lefty
Driesell's departure _ for
Maryland at the height of
the recruiting season has
thrown the top position at
Davidson into a mad scram
ble among at least five or
six of the original 75 appli-
cants.

A three man committee
consisting of President Sam
uel R. Spencer, Jr., Athletic
Director Tom Scott and Dean
of Faculty Frontis W. John-
son is screening the appli-

cants, but has made little.

of its present information
public. According to Scott
the committee has the list
down to five or six names
which he declines to reveal.
The Davidson assistant
coaches, Terry Holland and
Jerry Conboy, were among
the early favorites but seem
to have fallen back in the
most recent speculation.
Conboy was a highly suc
cessful high school coach in
Pennsylvania before joining
the staff here. After Drie-
sell’'s departure, he announc

to the head coaching position
he would not stay on as an

Conboy has already been
offered the head coaching
job at Point Park College in
Pittsburgh. His name was
mentioned earlier as one of
the top choices to replace
Bob Cousey at Boston Col-
lege.

coached under Driesell at
Davidson. In his senior year

tion in field goal percentage.

that he would not stay at

The two biggest names
mentioned -thus far seem (o
be out of consideration. Lou
Carnesecca. the volitale St.
John’s coach, was rumored
to have been offered the job
and to have turned it down.

Yet Bill Esposito, St. John's
sports information director,
was surprised to hear of the
rumor. “Lou's coaching here
next year. As far as I know
he hasn't even been contact:
ed by the people at David

The other top name, Mar
quette’s Al McGuire, has not
even applied for the position.
“T wasn't spoken to. I don't
want to consider any offers
alter what happened last
year and all the publicity
that came out of it.”

McGuire was offered a
position as general manager
and coach of the Milwaukee
Bucks last season, but Mar-
quetie would not let him
out of his multi-year contract
which still has three years to
run.

The top candidates at the
present seem to be Roy Skin-

Berry Picks Machis
To Win In Vollyball

By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor

The volleyball season be
gins Monday. and several
teams appear’ to be able to
win the championship.

Volleyball is a sport which,

‘like basketball. places a pre

mium.on quickness. agility.

and height. The Sigma Chis. .

last year’s winners with an
11-1 récord, again seem to
have these, qualities. partic-
ularly the latter. Jeff Pflug
ner. Pete Norton, Dave Was
serman. and Jim Long will
lead the team which again
should be a contender for the
volleyball championship.

The Phi Delts will field
their usually strong team.
particularly if 6-9 Rocky
Crosswhite plays. The Delts
were quite strong in games
in which Crosswhite played
last season. The Delts feature
an additional core of re.
turnees from last season.
plus newcomers like Gene
Early and John McCammon.

The Pikas, last year’s.run
ner’s up and the only team
to defeat the Sigma Chis, will
also field an excellent team.
Top returning players from
last season are Tom Hendren
and Joe Lansinger, while
sophomores Mark Affeldt and
Billy Pierce should help the
{eam considerably.

Another strong team will
be the Kappa Sigs. who will
be as big or bigger than. the
Sigma Chis. The best players
‘for the .Sigs will be Mike
Kelly, Gary Hemrit¢. Peter
Boggs. William Brown, and
Bill, McKenzie.

The ATO's are a question
mark, but have the potential
to be a good team if sopho
mores come through. Return
ing from last year's. leam
are John Durham and Jim
McDowell. Top sophomore’
prospects jnclude Brad Dan
felson, Larry Flynn. and Mort
Chiles.

The SPE’s should have one
of their. better teams of re-
cent years. They have some

turnees from last season.

The Sigma Nus have every
