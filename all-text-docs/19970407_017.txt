By Kerry Bropuy

Tensions ran high until the last
volley March 25 against Georgia
Southern, as the women’s tennis
team topped the defending South-
ern Conference champion Eagles.

Ga. Southern and the Wildcats
were knotted at three after six singles
matches.

_Davidson’s Ashley Maner
emerged victorious against Aude
Boulle, 6-3, 6-0. Clara Marks also
closed out a win over Melissa
Brown, 6-3, 6-3.

The tournament’s most excit-
ing moment arrived as both teams
battled for the doubles victory. Ga.
Southern secured the number one
doubles position while Davidson’s
Creecy Chandler and Ashley Maner
grabbed a win in the number three
doubles spot.

Butthe final outcome remained
undecided until the duo of Marks
and Claire Cheatwood and beat the
Eagle duo of Scarbrough and
Brown, 8-6.

“This was an extremely excit-
ing victory for Davidson tennis,”
said coach Caroline Price. “We are
one of the teams that has a legiti-
mate shot at a conference champi-
onship.”

Several tournaments remain

game’s participants could have been
aliens; it was still a tremendous display
of basketball. Period.

And our very own women’s squad
was synonymous with drama this win-
ter. As far as Coach Filar was con-
cerned, they made things a little too
exciting.

So there I was watching the four
best women’s collegiate basketball
teams in the country fighting and scrap-
ping their way to their sport’s pinnacle;
watching Tennessee’s Chamique
Holdsclaw — known as the female
Michael Jordan because of the expecta-
’ tion that she will one day revolutionize
her sport — rip Notre Dame’s and
ODU’s defenses to shreds; watching
two basketball teams pass the ball, catch
the ball, and shoot the ball.

So while the men’s game winces
and prepares for another mass exodus
of underage talent to the NBA, the
women’s game can look forward to two
more years of Holdsclaw. Because for
Holdsclaw and her peers, college still
means four years and an education.

And while the men desperately try
to salvage what once was, the women
continue to build something special.
Watching the games in Cincy, you got
the distinct feeling that the four teams
were battling each other for this year’s
hardware, but at the same time working
together for a greater goal.

Every player, every coach, every
media member who follows the sport
regularly — they are all ambassadors of
the game, constantly making statements
more powerful than any empty words
put forth in Title IX.

In this quest for equality, actions
truly speak louder than words.

Dearing shatters school javelin mark

By MICHAEL Kruse
Sports Editor

Dan Dearing broke the school
record in the javelin March 29 at the
Emory. University Classic in At-
lanta, recording a throw of 184 feet,
six inches.

“I was really happy with the
way I threw,” said the sophomore
standout. “But I still have a lot of
improvement to make before con-
fererice (April 18-19 at Boone).”

Dearing’s record-setting throw
highlighted the meet, as the Wild-
cats scored 10 points and finished
15th out of 23 teams.

The squad had an improved
showing Saturday at Winthrop.

The 4 x 400-meter relay team
of Ken Howard, Roland Williams,

Karim Lawrence, and Dearing -
running together for the first time
this year due to various injyrigs '-
won its race.»

Williams and Deng finished
second in the 200 and 400 hurdles,
respectively. Dearing also turned
in a third-place performance in the
javelin,

Steve Hsieh, Williams,
Lawrence, and Stan Baker placed
fourth in the 4 x 100, and Baker:
notched a fourth in the 400 hurdles.

Davidson travels to Durham
Friday and Saturday for the Duke
Invitational.

“Tt’s an awesome meet, by far
the biggest meet we go to,” said
Dearing. “It’s the best competition
we’ ll see all year. There are a lot of
world-class guys there.”

Women’s track shows improvement

By Bos LONERGAN
Staff Writer

The women’s track team con-
tinued their improvement with suc-
cessful meets at Emory and
Winthrop the past two weekends.

The Wildcats placed 13th out
of 22 teams at the Emory Classic.
Danielle Mall led the squad, taking
second in discus (40.84 meters).

Suzy Burrcracked the Top Ten
Performers list in javelin with a
throw of 22.22 meters.

Two ofthe more versatile Wild-
cats, Beth Goldstein and Schaap
Freeman, each competed in four

events and both turned in Top Ten

performances.

Kate Feldmeier set a school
record at Winthrop with a 2:27.45
performance in the 800. Jamilah
Sawyer also had a strong meet, fin-
ishing second in the 110 hurdles
and fourth in the 400 hurdles.

Allie Curranran extremely well
in the 5000, placing third out of a
group of over 20 runners.

Captain Laura Burkholder
soared to a fifth-place finish in the
long jump with a leap of 15.06
meters.

“These were two good meets
to get us warmed up for Duke (this
weekend in Durham),” said Kelly
Kiefer.

“T felt we played really hard the
first game,” Amanda Fleck said. “It
just went the other way. We didn’t
know how to work the offense. We
tried to work it better the next game,
and we did that.”

Two hours later, the team took
the field again and plodded through
the first half with undermanned
Longwood. Throughout the frame
the team would almost put the match

out of reach, only to relax and have -

Longwood reel off a string of goals.
Still, they held a 10-6 lead going
into the break.

“We all just decided that by
letting them score and not dropping
back, we were just making our-
selves more tired and giving our-
selves more running because we
were so tired,” Hogan explained. “T
think we just realized to do less
running we needed to play tougher
and then we could rest alittle more.
So we stepped it up at halftime
because we didn’t want to run that
much.”

There-focused team dominated
the first ten minutes after the break,
pushing their lead to 18-7, and then
cruised to the victory.

“We definitely did much better
(in the second half). We realized the
goalie came out and that we had to
put it around her instead of shooting
at her,” assistant coach Bryn Chave
said. “We worked as a team and got
the ball in the goal. That’s what we

“needed to do.”

Hogan led the team in scoring
Saturday (six goals, three assists),
while Fleck (six, one), Katie Will-
iams (five, two), and Allison Rhoads

(five, two) all tallied seven points
for the Wildcats.

The team collected three wins
over break, including a huge 17-16
win over Virginia Tech March 29.
The Hokies’ thumped the Wildcats
22-4 last season.

Davidson also dropped Notre
Dame, 21-7, on Monday and
Duquesne, 18-3, on Tuesday. .

“T think we’ re playing better,”

scoring leader Fleck (25 goals, 10
assists) said. “We’re learning from
the experience of playing these good
teams first and then expanding from
that. We have a lot of teams coming
up where it’s going to be close like
Roanoke.

“We hope we can break .500,
and another big goal is to beat Duke
(in the season finale April 30 at
Durham).”
