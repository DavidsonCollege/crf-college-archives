WDAV awaits

Federal grant
Plans for the expansion of
radio station WDAV hinge
upon the status of the college’s
application for a federal grant
from the Office of Education,
> according to Director of News
and Photography Earl W.

“‘Buck”’ Lawrimore.

“We're waiting on the fede-
ral grant before we begin any
major construction or pur-
chase of equipment,”’ he said.

Lawrimore expects to hear
from the government during
the summer. Then, if plans for
the expansion are indeed ap-
proved, the radio station
should be in operation with
18,000 watts ‘‘sometime
during the next school year.”’

Last month, TRANSCO Oil
Company in Mooresville re-
fused the College permission
to use its tower for the WDAV
antenna, a privilege seen as an
integral part of the boost to
high power.

Lawrimore is now optimistic
that TRANSCO may change
its mind and allow WDAV use
of the tower. :

‘‘We’ve talked with engi-
neers and technical experts
who agree that our equipment
will not interfere with
TRANSCO’s receiving fre-
quency, said Lawrimore.

The company is currently
concened with the weight of

‘the WDAV antenna, ac-
cording to Lawrimore, but he
feels that this difficulty can
also be overcome.

Sexe eamnigsione
r eports iS tndin ings

The Committee on Sex-
Blind Admissions has com-
pleted its survey and reported
its findings to the Council on
Campus and Religious Life

that the policy would result in
-a better calibre of students.

NEWSIN BRIEF

(CCRL). .

The six-member student
committee, considering the
consequences of adopting a
merit admissions policy at
Davidson, distributed a sur-
vey to 250 randomly selec-
ted students and 118 faculty
members and administrators.

One hundred and ninety-
five students and 56 faculty
returned the survey. An over-
view of the results:

In answer to the question
‘‘What percentage of men
to women would you pre-

fer,’’ about half of those
surveyed wanted a 50 to 6U

percent male enrollment and a
female enrollment of 50 to 40
percent.

Almost 60 percent were
opposed to a sex-blind, merit
based admissions ‘policy, one
“with no as to the
male/female ratio.” Forty per
cent approved of merit = hal
sions.

A large majority ot those
opposed to merit. admissions
indicated they could accept
such a policy if provisions
were made to keep the ratio of
men above 50 percent.

Those favoring merit admis-
sions most believed

Opponents to merit admiss-
ions often expressed a. desire
to preserve the tradition of
Davidson as a predominantly
male college. at

“Regardless of a sions
policy and assuming no over-
crowding,” 47 percent wanted
enrollment to remain at 1300,
a bit lower than the present
level.

Another 47 percent wanted
to see an enrollment increase
to 1500. Six percent wanted
enrollment cut to 1000.

The CCRL decided to send
the results of the committee’s
survey to College President
Samuel R. Spencer, Jr., and to
the Admissions Council, a
student-faculty group.

The CCRL hopes that Spen-
cer and the Admissions Coun-
cil will study the work of the
committee and make recom-
mendations.

The committee plans to
make a presentation to the
Board of Trustees in their
October meeting.

YMCA plans
coffeehouse

The YM/YWCA needs two
or three people to help organ-
ize a coffeehouse and educa-
tional program for junior and

senior high school students in ~

the Davidson-Cornelius area.

‘75 Quips and Cranks soon to arrive

Director of Alumni Rela-
tions Zachary F. Long, Jr.
confirmed this week that the
1975 Quips and Cranks should
arrive at Davidson from the
printers by June 1.

Long was appointed to fi-
nish the '75 yearbook when
student editor Carroll Ensley
graduated without finishing
his assignment. Long has been
working since Fall term 1975
to finish the yearbook. —

Possible educational programs
would provide intruction in
crafts, sewing, ecology—
almost anything! A coffee-
house on Friday ér Saturday
nights would feature good
music, munchies, local talent,
and friends.

PIRG lobbies for bottle bill

By JOHN HEDRICK
Several Davidson students
travelled to a public legislative

~~ hearing held Wednesday at

the North Carolina General
Assembly. _

Discussed at the hearing
was House Bill 697, which pro-
vides for substitution of re-
turnable for non-returnable
beverage containers, a scrap-
ping of the pop-tops and ring

—binders,and-—a-_five-cent—min-

imum refundable deposit on all
beverage containers.

RALEIGH—A spokesman for
the bottling industry admitted
that the proponents’ argu-
ments for House Bill 697 are
valid, though, he attempted to
downplay their significance.

An environmentalist con-
ceded that there are many
social costs.

The hearings were held in
the Legislative Auditorium
before a packed crowd of obsev
Even though the speakers
were split equally between the

two sides, there was no doubt
from the first speech that the
crowd strongly favored pas-
sage of the bill.

Both. sides came fully pre-
pared with their legal views
and emotional appeals. Since
this issue appeared in North
Carolina in 1975 there has not
been much room for compro-
mise.

The Citizens for Returnable
Beverage Containers, a coali-
tion containing consumer, en-
nvironmental, farmer, civic,
and public interest groups,
was opposed by representa-
tives from the canning, bot-
tling, and retailing industries
as well'as organized labor.

The coalition favored the
bill as a means to promote
resource recovery, solid waste
reduction, less litter, more
jobs, energy conservation, and
less cost to the consumer.
Opponents countered with a
variety of statements that the

. bill wasn’t needed, that it was

the wrong solution, and that
its scope wasn’t wide enough.

Shs

After the hearing, Peter
Brown, Director of the North
Carolina Public Interest Re-
search Group (NC PIRG), said
that the discussion in the

hearing is just the beginning:

“At this time letter-writing is
especially crucial if we are to
achieve the bill’s passage.

“Legislators do notice their
mail more than other forms of
communication, do pay atten-
tion to it, and feel an obli-
gation to respond to it, espe-
cially if the letter writers. are
from their district. It does
make a difference.’

In the afternoon Davidson

- students went to all the Char-

lotte-Mecklenburg representa-
tives and found that they were
generally favorable but still
hadn’t studied the bill closely
for their final decision.

Earlier in the week between
90 and 100 letters from stu-
dents and professors were sent
to H. Parks Helms, chairman
of the committee, urging pas-
sage of the bill.
