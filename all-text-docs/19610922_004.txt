“I have not thought beyond
the first semester. but again. we
will probably want to take part
in the State Drama Festival.
I am the vice-president of the
Carolina Dramatic Association
and would probably be consider-
ed derelict in my duties if we
did not.”

Dr. Thomas Will Be
Vespers Speaker

Dr. John Uton Thomas, pro-
fessor of theology at Union
Theological Seminary in Rich-
mond, will speak to upperclass-
men at vespers on Sunday, Sept.
24, at 7:30 p. m. in the College
Church.

Dr. Thomas is a graduate of
Washington and Lee University
and of the University of Edin-
burgh. He has held pastorates
in Richmond, Va., and in Char-
leston, S. C. At present he is a
Fellow of the National Council
of Religion in Higher Educa-
tion.

FRESHMAN VESPERS

He is teaching a survey course
in dramatic literature and
theater history each semester
as well as shouldering the re-
sponsibilities which fall to the
director of the Vagabonds.

He came to Davidson as a re-
sult of the upsurge of interest
.in fine arts here.

DRAMA WAS DEAD

“Drama was dead here for a
long time,” he said. “Then. last
year, Dr. Goodykoontz of the
English department got with
some interested students and
began doing plays.

“Under his leadership and
dynamic personality they blos-
somed. Then, with the advent
of the new fine arts building,
it was realized that Dr. Goody-
koontz could no longer carry the
load of the growing department
in addition to his regular work.”

Sneden was born in Tenefly,
New Jersey and attended public
schools there. In 1954, he en-;
tered the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, where
he studied the classics and fine
arts. He received his MA from
Chapel Hill in 1960.

ROMANTIC INCLINATION The freshmen will continue to

of October, the freshmen will
begin attending vespers in the|
College Church.

Dr. Staples mentioned that the
vespers speakers during the
coming school year will repre-
sent a variety of denominations.

He plans to do three produc-
tions with the Vagabonds be-
tween now and the end of the
fall term. “Of course,” he says.
‘what we have pressing is the
gala dedication performance for
the new fine arts building.” This
will be the production of Noah,
a play from the Wakefield |
Cycle. for the dedication of the;
Fine Arts Building October 26. |
This play will be half serious,
half slapstick, on much the same
order of The Second Shepherd’s
Play. It will be given other
nights so that the entire student
body will have a chance of see-
ing it, but no other dates have
been determined.

Then he will direct the Vaga-

John Patrick, a sentimental’

Belas Again Win
Scholarship Trophy

Beta Theta Pi received the
Inter - Fraternity Scholarship
Trophy for the third straight
year for last year’s achievement.
The Betas won with a scholastic
average of 1.859, with the ATO's
placing second with a 1.669 aver-
‘age. The top four fraternities
were all above last year’s all-
student average of 1.669.

Out of the last seven years,
the Betas have won the trophy
four times, the ATO’s three.
Both have dropped below second
place only once in the last seven
years.

This year scholarship will be
a factor in awarding the Best
Pledge Class Award. “I trust
that more fraternities on cam-
pus will make good scholarship
a tradition,” John Kuykendall,
fraternity-faculty liaison officer,
commented.

The fraternity scholastic
averages are as follows:

Lobanov Fights Reds
By Teaching Them

BY DAN BROADHEAD
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“The best antidote to the threat of world commun-
ism is knowledge,” said a gentleman this week, who is
striving to increase this knowledge he feels is so import-

ant.

Not even the required retire-
ment age at the University of
Michigan could make Professor
Andrei Lobanov-Rostovsky give
up dedication to that task. And
that explains his presence at
Davidson this year as a visiting
professor under the John Hay
Whitney Foundation.

“Raising the tone of countries
is the safest method to stop the
spread of communism,” he says.
The knowledge of history holds
one of the keys. “Would you
seek a cure from a doctor who
didn't know his medicine,” he
asked.

Learning this history has oc-
cupied much of Prof. Lobanov's
lifetime. The son and nephew of
famous Russian diplomats, he
has played a large role in mak-
ing history dlso.

Prof. Lobanov served as an
officer in the Tsar's Imperial
Guards before World War T.
Working up to the rank of cap-
tain, he spent the war period on
the German front. With the out-
break of the revolution in 1917
he was assigned to a Russian
division serving under the
French in Macedonia.

After the first nine months of
the revolution, communism be-
gan to infiltrate and Soviet
propaganda collapsed the morale
of the army. Lobanov enlisted
with the French for the rest of
the war.

Following the armistice, he

returned to Russia tp join Gen-
eral Demikin of the White
Army. When the Whites were
defeated cver two million peo-
ple filed Russia, Prof. Lobanov
among them. His family position
and military rank made him a
prime target.

He began his dual role of
teacher and student shortly
thereafter. He spent four years
in Paris studying at the Ecole
des Sciences Politiques, con-
tinuing his education in political
science, economics, and history.
After moving to London, he be-
gan writing articles on history
and doing free lance lecturing.

Sir Bernard Peres, the prom
inent scholar of Russian history,
advised Lobanov to come to
America where the public was
just beginning to study Russian
history.

Thirty-one years of teaching
have ensued from that advice.
Prof. Lobanov joined the faculty
at UCLA in 1930. In 1943 he
took a “war leave” to do special
teaching at the University of
Wyoming. Since 1945, he had
been teaching at Michigan until
his compulsory retirement from
that institution last spring. ‘

These classes have been con-
ducted in Russian, English and
French. In addition, Prof. Lo-
banov can converse in German
and Italian and read Spanish as
well.

Cumming Battles Seminoles
To Spare Sunshine State

Dr. William P. Cumming returned from Washing-
ton, D. C., today, where he spent three days serving as a
major witness in the case of the Seminole Indians vs. the
United States. He testified for the Justice Department in

| the Court of Claims with the State of Florida at stake.

The Seminoles base their
claim to Florida on a supposed-
ly illegal treaty and Dr. Cum-
ming was given the task of find-
ing another treaty that would
supercede the first one. Al-

though he has provided informa-
tion for both sides of the suit,
Dr. Cumming has been retained
by the Justice Department be-
cause he found an old treaty
which he believes will exclude
part of the state from the case.

Cumming began research for
his testimony three years ago
while he was in England. Be-
cause he had a background of
map-study, he was asked by the
government to hunt up old
