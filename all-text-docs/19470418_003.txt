O rts LETS WHIP FURMAN

By answering in the negative the question of whether
or not Davidson should subsidize athletes, as a group ol
students did several weeks ago when interviewed by the
Davidsonian’s roving reporter, those who voiced their
opinions failed to provide a solution to the problem ot
what should be done about intercollegiate sports. It is
common knowledge that within recent years, Davidson
and the other small schools haven't had the “goods” to
consistently compete on an equal basis with the larger
colleges and universities in the Southern Conference, It
is by no means a reflection on the athletes or the coaching
staffs of the schools with small enrollments. It is, how-
ever, concrete proof that institutions that go in for buy-
ing “b@et on the hoof” for their varsity squads are far
superior in strength to those who frown upon the pradtice.
What’s to be done to bring this sort of thing to a screech-
ing halt and give the little schools in the loop a chance ?

: Without a doubt the ideal solution would be

for all colleges to abandon the “hobby” entirely.
This won’t happen until pressure is brought to
bear on a nation-wide basis on everyone connect-
ed with intercollegiate athletics. Even when and if
that comes off it will probably be years before
rules can be drafted and adopted which will ef-
fectively control the college “play for pay” racket.
It’s true that even now reforms are being ad-
vocated by prexies, coaches, and athletic directors
‘of a number of institutions or higher learning but
this effort will surely be fought tooth and_ nail
by the representatives of the schools which have
won national acclaim and publicity as a result
of their grid and cage crews. Getting into the
limelight is, undeniably, beneficial to these out-
fits and they'll do everything in their power to
stay there as long as possible. They’re willing in

most cases ‘to leave the supremacy in some
minor sports to their little rivals but they
aren’t nearly so.generous with the titles in

the sports that count with the average fan. Even-
tually subsidization will be outlawed but until
then what courses of action are open to those
who don’t care for the way things seem to be
going?

Of course the Schools who are opposed to this theory
could do a complete about face and start putting” the
cash on the line for ballplayers. This would result ina
gigantic auction sale with the best athletes going to the
highest bidders—eaving the little colleges right where
they started and making the system even m¢ re complicated
and corrupt. That answer to the current $04 question
is definitely out. ;

There remain about three possible solutions, all com-

plete with advantages and disadvantages. Look "em over,
pay.your money,-and take your choice. I*irst—do nothing
at all-about it, give in a sense our stamp of approval to
the whole setup, continuing to take frequent lickings
from the “big boys” as they prep for important imter-
sectional clashes. This technically can’t be called a solu-
tion because it leaves us with the original problem but
it is a way out — or a way to shelve a major headache.
Second — Davidson and the majority of the clubs in the
Southern Conference could elect to pull out of the loop
entirely and organize a separate one. This would enable
each school’s athletes to compete against men of equal
“caliber (teams of equal-teserve strength, ete.) but the
new league would lack the prestige that its predecessor
had. (It would in effect be like being released to the
minors after long service in the major leagues.) I*inally
— we could remain within the circuit and compete only
with the smaller clubs — letting the subsidizers have
the lion’s share of the honors. This also would have
advantages but a school’s gate receipts are bound to
dwindle when the local cash customers can’t see the
leading contenders perform in the ballyard.

There are many other angles to this puzzle but most
of them are a little remote. It can’t be denied that
here is a troublesome problem, Think it over and see
what should be done. After all in a sense it's your
baby.

Kappa Sigmas Cop
Volleyball Crown

Paced by Buddy Cheek and Pat
Williams, the Kappa Sigs rolled
over nine opponents to cop the 1947
interfraternity volley boll crown.
The victory catapulted the Sigmas
back into the thick of the fight for
the coveted cup with the Phi Delts
and the Phi Gams. Barring stun-
ning upsets in the softball tourna-
ment the final winner will come
from this trio.

The Phi Delts with 8 wins in 9
starts finished second followed by
the SAE’s with 5 victories and 3
defeats. The last named club has
one game left to play as we go to
press, but judging from their per-
formances regular season
they should cop it easily, thus win-
ning undisputed possession of the
third slot. A would dump
them into a tie for third with three
other aggregations:

Baseballers Drop
Five on Road Trip

Davidson's first baseball game of
the scrap with Duke’s
Blue Devils proved to be an un-
fortunate but prophetic beginning
as far as the first two weeks of the
season are concerned. Seven games
following closely during the next
two weeks were no more helpful to
the Davidson average. Two of these
games were with the Charlotte
Hornets team of the class B Tri-
state league. Of the remaining six,
two were conference tilts.

The team’s best effort of the year
was the game with Clemson which
proved to be more or less a pitcher’s

beautiful five hit game but Clem-

Future Outlook

Starting off the season with some
rather unorthodox pairings, Coach
Bill Lufler has brought a high per-
centage of victories to the Davidson

uled match during the*season so far,
the team has shown up well under
stiff competition. The netters came

Last Monday the Y Ping-pong &
Pool Tournament started off in a
big way with 117 entrants, 67 in
ping-pong and 50 in pool. It is
hoped that all initial boutssin both
singles and doubles can be played
off this week. The pool competi-
tion will be in Straight rather than
French because it offers a, fairer
opportunity for selection of the best
player. In ping-pong the best play-
ers will be those who win 3 out of
5 games; in the semi-finals, 4 out
of 7; and in the finals, 5 out of 9.

Here are some of the top seeded
players: Ping-pong Singles:
Charles Shaw, Clayton Carpenter,
