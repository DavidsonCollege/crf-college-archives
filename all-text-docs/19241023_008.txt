“Working Your

Made Feasible

Writing life ins urance has
enabled many a man to pay his
way through college. It is a
dignified calling and a true social
service.

To induce your fellows to form
habits of thrift — to obligate
them to put by a little of their
income — to safeguard them
against future loss of earning
power—is a form of effort that
brings keen satisfaction as well
as profit.

These are only a few of the
reasons why the insurance bus-
iness today is attracting the
very best brains of America.

Write for the full particulars: of
a plan whereby you can assist
yourself through college, and,
at the same time, prepare for a
profitable and satisfactory bus-
iness career.
