An Interview | ?
Brubeck. Explains Career
As Prominent Jazz Leader

“We have to broaden the listening experience
of the audience, and not just give them something
that a record company has taught them to

expect.”

By ERNEST GLENN
Staff Writer

Dave Brubeck is one of the
giants of modern jazz. His rise
to fame has been mostly
through the Dave Brubeck
Quartet, which performed as a
unit for nearly twenty years.

Brubeck now performs with
three of his sdns in their new
group, ‘‘Two Generations. of
Brubeck.”

Brubeck described how the
new group, and his role in it, dif-
fers from the old quartet.

“The performance varies
from my playing with my sons
to Darius’ (Brubeck) group
playing by themselves to all of
us playing together.”’

Still an active composer,
Brubeck says finding time for
writing is sometimes difficult,
with the heavy schedule of con-
cert performances.

“T write all the time: in the
airplane, in the corner of the
airport, anywhere. I even have

more time now that I’m
travelling with young people
because they do all the details
like claiming baggage.

“*A lot of so called adults who
are big stars expect everyone to
wait on them,” he,joked.

Not only a gfeat composer
and performer in his jazz com-
bo, Brubeck has written several
larger works utilizing orchestra
and chorus. ‘“‘Light in the Wil-
derness,”’ a religious work ‘for
symphony and chorus, is one of
Brubeck’s works which has re-
ceived greatest praise.

Brubeck is currently, working
on two large commissioned
works. He is composing a bicen-
tennial piece, just com-
missioned by the New Haven
Symphony. The second piece is
a Christmas composition for the
Honolulu Symphony.

Asked for a preview of what
to expect for the Midwinters
concert, Brubeck said, ‘‘If I told
you, it could come out com-

pletely different from what I
said. We play songs very dif-
ferent on various nights.”’

Darius Brubeck is the oldest
son of the family. He has his
own jazz group, which is per-
forming as part of the ‘‘Two
Generations”’ concert.

‘Darius’ group is leading the
avant-garde of jazz back to°
some of the New Orleans roots.
I think it is important that
young jazz musicians keep in
contact with the foundations of
jazz.”

Following up  on_ this
statement, Brubeck discussed
the dangers of the avant garde
and. the musician’s respon-
sibility to his art. _

“You always have the avant-
garde way out in front doing a
lot of things that will be totally
dropped. The audience controls
a lot more than people think.”’

“The greatest group I ever
had was forced to disband
because there was no audience

to listen to it.

“You have to learn to do what
you want to and still have an
audience. The groups that are
making it now--Chick Corea and
Herbie Hancock, know how to
do this. Get your audience
there, then educate them. Don’t
sell out to Madison Avenue.

‘At one of my concerts you
might hear a religious piece and
then an old time jazz song, or
something very new. We have
to broaden the listening ex-
perience of the audience, and
not just give them something
that a record company has
taught them to expect.”

When asked about the new
wave of very electrified jazz
groups, Brubeck did not judge
them harshly.

“It’s hard to condemn anyone
for the music he makes. When I
listen to a really good rock
guitarist, a type of music I
usually do not like, I can see
that he too has become an ex-
tension of his instrument and is

“The Front Page’’ as spruced up by
Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond takes on
all the high polish of a technical exercise
as played by a master pianist.

These wily _ gentlemen have _ been
making brash, ‘‘Hollywood”’ moviés for
more years than I can remember--
Diamond assisting on the screenplays--
and they are in perfect practice with
“The Front Page.”

This film is virtually flawless, a!most a
masterpiece. It has a triumpant unity
within its diversity; every element
seems to be wonderfully alive and con-
tributing toward the same end.

Based on the play by Ben Hecht and
Clarks MacArthur, the movie spins an
outrageous tale of a race against time to
get out a sensational front page story on
a rapidly developing event and of the
charming ruination of the personal lives
of most of the characters involved--
Wilder and Diamond take great delight
in this last.

The movie whips along at a ferocious
pace, and the actors more wham their
lines than actually deliver them. Like
Michael Curtiz, Wilder realizes that
speed is the secret of much successful
film-making and, like Ken Russell, he
knows that overactivity is next to
Godliness.

Of course, it is only good overacting
which is more decorative than good un-
deracting, and most of the overacting in
“The Front Page’’ is excellent. Wilder is
a talented bit’ undependable director of
actors: He whips them into frenzies and

gives them a fecund atmosphere in which
to work but seems unable to help them

with technique.

His and Diamond’s screenplay
provides excellent dialogue and some
wonderful opportunities for the em-
broidering of stock characterizations.
Nearly every member of the cast with a
role of any size manages a few
miraculously inspired, perfectly timed
vaudeville turns.

There is much competent work--by
David Wayne, as the old maid
homosexual Bensinger, and Dora Meran-
de, as the washed-out scrub woman
Janie, for instance.

Vincent Gardenia, looking like a
gopher beneath spreading eye-brows,
cuts a little masterpiece of controlled
overacting as the harassed, blustering
and blushing sheriff (or some such) of
New York City, ‘‘Honest’’ Pete Hartman.
John Korkes is scarcely less memorable
as the cub reporter (Rudee Keppler),
fresh out of college, where he learned
nothing of any use.

On the other hand, Austin Pendleton is
disappointing as the murderer Williams,
and Carol Burnett flounders in a
misguided attempt to add serious dimen-
sions to her role as the hooker with a
heart of gold, Mollie Malloy. (I figure
Burnett’s performance bad enough to
catch an Oscar nomination, though it
could be worse. )

Walter Matthau warms over slightly
molded Horace Vandergelder as . the
mean old newspaper editor Walter
Burns, and Jack-Lemmon also only ap-
proximates his role, as the prodigal
reporter Hildy Johnson.

But there are good points to all the per-

formances. Matthau and Lemmon havea

certain amount of presence and _ per-

sonality, which are probably the most
important qualities for leading players to
have. And Burnett alows herself a few of
the audacious, caricature touches she is
so good at.

“The Front Page’ is easily strong
enough to weather the deviations of the
performances. In an art which. wears out
so many directors so quickly, Wilder is
still enthusiastically pouring his per-
sonality and his vision into his work at
nearly seventy years of age.

“The Front Page’”’ is the type of movie
which he and Diamond love to do and
which I love to see them doing, and the
cast is one they ‘eel at ease with. By
keeping true to their temperaments and
vindicating them with talent and
imagination, Wilder and Diamond are
somehow also true to the temperaments
of the rest of us, if that makes any sense.

They are rank sentimentalists who
zealously try to cover up their sen-
timentality with mock cynicism, and the
resulting concoctions are fascinating,
even if more self-contradictory than ac-
tually ambiguous.

“The Front Page” has a beautifully
sustained comic-book atmosphere in its
vaudeville acting, flawless
cinematography, stylized set designs and
slick camera placements. Wilder is
fossilizing in some ways, but it suits him.
“Fhe Front Page” is an exquisitely
preserved relic from the past. It ‘ac-
complishes well what ‘The Sting’ could
only attempt.

cores

putting his heart into his
music.”’

Brubeck also noted, ‘‘We’re
using more electric instruments
ourselves. I played the electric,
piano on the ‘Two
Generations’ album, though I
haven’t since then.”’

Commenting further on elec-
tricity in rock music and jazz,
and where it is leading,
Brubeck said that rock
musicians will lead music back
to having heavier jazz and
classical overtones.

“They have the audience, and
are realizing that a better mood
is obtained through quieter,
more complex music. Ask most
rock musicians who they
idolize, and it’s probably a
classical or jazz musician.”

Any biographical sketch of
Brubeck mentions that he
studied under the French com-
poser Darius Milhaud, after
who'n his oldest son is named.

Milhaud incorporated
elements of American jazz into
his neo-classical music.
Brubeck stated that the
greatest influence the French
composer had on him was the
sheer magnitude of his person
as an artist.

‘‘Milhaud said if you’re going
to reflect America in your
music, you have to include jazz.
He was telling me the greatest
American composers were Ger-
shwin and Ellington when no
one else was treating them
seriously.”’

Art Tatum, the blind jazz
pianist of the forties, served as
another. strong influence on
Brubeck. :

“Tatum was one of the most
gifted musicians ever put on
earth. He had a perfect mind
plus true soul, and he worked
like a slave. These are the

ingredients of a_ great
musician.’’
Later in the interview,

Brubeck again stressed the con-
flicts a musician encounters
with making his art known in a
worldrun by Madison Avenue.

“T’ve fought them all my life.
When one company wouldn’t
record my music, I started my
own record label. Another com-
pany wouldn’t record my
religious music, so I switched.
I’ve had the pleasure of winning
several of these battles.’’

Brubeck was deeply com-
mitted to the idea that men
should be in control of the music
market, not machines or sales
charts. He said that record
companies have an obligation to
society to provide a variety of
music. — >

who do offer a great variety of
interesting music.

‘“‘We had quite a response to
the concert .in Charlotte,”
Brubeck said. ‘‘We hope to get a
good crowd at Davidson.”’
