The Concept Of Honor

Last week’s suspension of a student
by the Honor Court has again brought
to light, in spite of recent develop-
ments which serve to remove most of
the controversy, certain weaknesses
in Davidson's honor system — weak-
nesses which are mostly procedural,
but which are significant enough to
warrant change for the purpose of
strengthening Davidson’s honor sys-
tem and her concept of the Honor
Court.

The point which is relevant is that,
as a result of situations such as last
week’s controversy, the Honor Court
easily acquires a “Gestapo” image in
the eyes of many who may be con-
vinced that a student who is tried in
secret and convicted on evidence
which the Court refuses to disclose is
often given a “raw deal.”

While we believe this not to be the
case, none the less the secrecy that
attends all actions of the Honor Court,
combined with the punishment which
it must impose, serves to alienate stu-
dents from an honor system of which
they are a part and with which they
should identify themselves. This
alienation from the honor system
serves to weaken the system among
those who must be fully committed to
it in order for the system to work.

In addition to the weakness of a
lack of full student identification with
their honor system is the disadvantage
that in the present system all that is
known as certain among most stu-
dents without illegal leaks from the
Honor Court members or witnesses,
is the identity of the person suspend-
ed and the specific charge, facts which
can never be hidden whether officially
announced or not.

What is not certain are the actual
circumstances of the violation and the
grounds upon which the conviction
is made.

A number of accounts circulate
concerning the nature of the violation
and evidence used to convict the de-
fendant.

In some instances these accounts
are slanted unfavorably toward the
Honor Court since the defendant may
give his version of.the conviction to
outsiders, omitting or altering the
facts which led to his conviction.

The present practice by the Honor
Court of making available no informa-
tion or extremely minimal informa-
tion only serves to perpetuate the
rumors.

Therefore, we would recommend
that a record of any Honor Court trial
in which a student is suspended fom
school be formulated by the Court

Recorder, relating all facts pertinent
to the circumstances of the violation
and all evidence upon which the con-
viction was made.

Since the Honor Court acts as an
agent of the self-governing student
body in imposing the suspensions,
then members of the student body
could have access to the facts of the
suspension and thus, if they desire,
learn why their agents acting for them
have dismissed a student from the col-
lege.

For the protection of the defendant,
such a record would be made available
only upon a conviction leading to sus-
pension from school and then only
after an individual’s means of appeal
to higher college authorities have
been exhausted. Only Davidson stu-
dents would have a right to see this
record.

Since a confession would remove
the necessity for supporting evidence,
there would be recorded for a con-
viction in which a confession is made
only the fact that a student has ad-
mitted to a violation of the particular
Student Body Regulation in question
and has been suspended from school.

The purpose of the secrecy of
Honor Court proceedings is to protect
the defendent, but it can hardly be
argued that a student dismissed from
school is protected significantly more
if students know that he was dismis-
sed for stealing — leaving to their
imaginations and rumors what he
stole — than if they know he was
dismissed for stealing an umbrella or
three dollars or fifty dollars.

Publication of the evidence would
not in all cases convince all students
of the validity of the Court’s decision,
for some individuals would exploit
the infomation gained bv publication
in trying to incriminate the Court.

Yet we feel that in most cases re-
sulting in convictions the evidence is
conclusive in itself. Also, the fact
that interested students would be able
to draw their conclusions from the
actual facts of the case rather than
from vague misinformation would
more than compensate for those skep-
tics who would use the facts, as would
be their privilege, to disparage the
Court’s decision.

Such changes as we have discussed
would definitely serve to increase stu-
dent identification with the honor sys-
tem which they in theory, operate and
most importantly would alleviate to a
preat extent the unfortunate situa-
tions and resulting hostilities: which
arise from misinformation often aris-
ing from the present procedure.

Room For Improvement

In changing two aspects of the
rush system, the Faculty Committee
on Fraternities, Clubs and Social Life
made a wise decision this week which
should make the ordeal much more
bearable for all involved.

The fact that the committee follow-
ed the recommendations of the Inter-
fraternity Council to the letter is an
indication of the respect the commit-
tee holds for that body.

Not only did the committee agree to
pass the IFC’s requests for Sunday
rush parties and Tuesday afternoon
dorm rush, but it also concurred with
the IFC in its rejection of the Fresh-
man Council’s request that bids be
accepted after rushees have returned
from Christmas vacation.

With the IFC’s potential for initiat-
ing change it is regrettable they have
not used their influence more con-
structively, especially during this first
year when there obviously remain a
number of deficiencies in the sys-
em.

Fraternity men who this year have
been asking for Sunday rush parties
have been rebuffed by IFC members
with the vapid explanation: “The fac-
ulty said last spring rush parties
would be on Saturday.”

The council never actively investi-
gated the possibility of having Sunday
parties, despite a host of cogent argu-
ments in its favor and nothing against
the possibility except that ‘the faculty
said so.” It was only after a student-
initiated movement gained the sup-
port of a petition by the fraternity
presidents for Sunday parties that the
IFC considered the possibility.

Nobody is seriously asserting that
the IFC is “out to kill the fraternity
system.”

_But the fact remains that the coun-
cil has been terribly lax in taking the
initiative in original and constructive
leadership for making the needed in-
novations in the less-than-perfect,
compromise system of rush.

Liberal Arts Tradition

Nearly overlooked by students in
the interest over action taken last
week by the Board of Trustees on
amendments to the drinking rule was
the second and final approval by the
Trustees to a new policy in regard to
the Christian faith of permanent fac-
ulty members.

_ Last spring, when the first read-
ing of the new policy was approved
by the board, the action was also
overshadowed by another matter more
directly related to the student body—
the fraternity issue.

_ Thus, the long-standing and notor-
ious faculty oath has been abolished
in favor of what amounts to simply
the satisfaction by college officials of
the Christian faith of the professors.

The final approval of this measure

follows numerous attempts to revise
the old vow, the most recent of which
was last falls amendment which
would have retained the provision for
written statements by prospective pro-
fessors for tenure on the faculty.

The standards expected for profes-
sors desired at Davidson are still made
clear by Trustees following their ac-

tion last week.

In respect to professional pride and
intellectual honesty, the Trustees have
replaced the oath with the full con-
fidence they must possess in the of-
ficials of the college.

As students we hope that such a
concern for the future of Davidson
might be manifest even more em-
phatically by the board in the imme-
diate years ahead.

Dear Editor:

In the lead editorial of last
week's DAVIDSONIAN, the edi-
tor criticized the outburst of
rash and giddy criticism of. the
Honor Court which folowed its
latest trial. The editor was un-
doubtedly right in attributing the
great amount of interest in the
case to three causes: the un-
usual nature of the case, the
personality of the defendant, and
the ways in which the decision
was announced.

But this analysis of the situa-
tion fails to explain why all
the comment was critical, and
avidly so. One of the primary
reasons was the unavailability
to the student body of the facts
about the case. Anyone feeling
some doubt about the proceed-
ings had no way to be reas-
sured.

Members of the court could
not help him because their hands
were tied by the tradition of
secrecy. The recording of the
trial which was put at the dis-
posal of the defendant was large-
ly inaudible. (Is it true that
there is no other record of the
proceedings?) Rumors filled the
place of the unavailable facts.

The editor wrote..‘‘The de-
cision in this case, as in every
instance,
solid testimony was heard, we
feel sure.’ He was forced to
add that last insecure qualifi-
cation because there was no
way for him to know if what
he felt was indeed true.

Likewise for the opposition.
We must al] choose between be-
ing rumor-mongers or assuming
the attitude of the three dumb
monkeys Hear No Evil, See No
Evil, and Speak No Evil.

I suggest that it does not pro-
mote the attitude of inquiry
which should accompany edu-
cation or the cause of justice to
preserve the secrecy of court
proceedings. Let the defendant
have the right to make an ac-

public, if he judges that this
would not harm his case or his
reputation.

This would remove the protec-
tion our judges have against
the consequences of any mis-
take they might make because
they are human and because
they are amateurs.

More importantly, this would
enable the honor system to be
examined and criticized as it
works, not in the abstract. Im-
provement would come more of-
ten from the correction of ac-
tual errors than from abstract
reflection upon the system.

I will briefly mention several
other improvements which have
been discussed during this re-
cent rise in interest. The de-
fendant’s advocate should not
be a member of the court (who
is consequently deprived of his
vote), but should be a perma-
nent attachment to the court,
familiar with its operation.

The same applies to those who
collect evidence and argue for
the prosecution, for obvious rea-
sons. A conviction resulting in
suspension should require a
unanimous decision, as in civil
trials. °

Finally, it would do much to
improve our understanding of
the court's operation if the pam-
phlet which it has prepared to
elucidate these matters were
made available to students now.

Dear Editor:

SOCRATES: My good man, do
you know why two years of
ROTC are required at David-
son, and. if so, will you tell me
the reason:

SERGEANT: Yes, of course,
Socrates: We feel that the ROTC
program has something to offer.

SOCRATES: Well, you would
certainly admit that every
course at Davidson has some
thing to offer. Are you advo-
cating, in the light of this state
ment, that every course should
be required for two years,

SERGEANT: Certainly not.
Socrates, but the ROTC program
has something special to o’fer:
It is the only course in school
that: teaches leadership.

SOCRATES: Do you mean that
a student learns leadership by
being commanded on the drill
field by upperclassmen,

SERGEANT: Well, not exact-
ly, Socrates. Before a student
can become a leader, he must
first learn to be a follower; this
is what the first two years of
the course teaches.

SOCRATES: Therefore, if a
student takes only two years of
the course, he does not- learn
leadership at all but rather ‘‘fol-
lowship."’ which most people
know already; and, in this case,
the student who takes only two
years misses what the course
claims to offer.

SERGEANT: Yes, indeed, So-
crates, it does seem so to me.
I really don't see any reason
for requiring the course. More-
over, I am tired of dealing with
these students who are not the

Jeast bit interested and add
nothing to the program. I think
that the two-year requirement
should be abolished.

Dear Editor:

It was with a great deal of
satisfaction and interest that I
read your article of October 8
concerning Geofges Nzongola's
initiative as publisher of the
small but significant newspaper
“La Voix des etudiants con-
golais.”’

Since then I have had the op-
portunity to read the first edi-
tion, eleven pages of pertinent
information, intelligent observa-
tion, and rational ideas, and
were it not for the fact that it is
written entirely in French, I
would recommend it to each and
every one of you.

The necessity of such a pub-
lication in the United States,
as Georges so correctly stated,
emanates from the very lack of
information and varied criticism
concerning Africa available to
Americans and to Africans who
have the privilege of studying
in the United States but the
misfortune of finding themselves
in a situation quite often iso-
lated from the major sources
of African news and opinion.

What sources are available to
Davidson students who are inter-
ested in the vicious circles of
African politics? What is to be
known about the ideas which

tionable.

This presupposes an extraor-
dinary amount of faith in the
judgment of the individuals in-
volved and raises questions
about its procedural techniques
and its substantive purpose.
With regard to the former, tra-
ditional Anglo-Saxon jurispru-
dence is apparently too liberal.

Innocent until proved guilty,
“reasonable doubt,’ and the
unanimous verdict of a jury of
one’s peers are inadequate. Also,
there is presumably a manual
of formalized rules for the
court, but who besides its mem-
bers know its contents?

The college, too, must share
responsibility Who suggested the
legally unacceptable lie detector
test? From where and why was
the ad hoc “Judiciary Commit-
tee” brought into existence?

The rationalization, of course,
is the paramount importance of
honesty. But what is its utility?
It is the essential ingredient of
mutual trust in personal rela-
tionships and of predictable be.
havior in those with a reputa-
tion for honesty—a stable and
reliable element in an_ other-
wise often chaotic world.

To justify the capriciousness
of the Honor Court's latest ac-
tion, honesty must assume a
transcendent value in and of it-
self, an ultimate principle that
must determine in a comprehen-
sive sense the actions of those
living under its authority. Cas-
uistry will not be employed to
argue the premises of ultimate
principles.

Is not to plead the case for
the holiness of only one idea
tantamount to an admission of
its hollowness? In other words,
when our values become anchor-
ed to a presumed universal
fixity, do we not become blind
to the relativity of our own
presumption?

The objection to determination
is that it is often short-sighted;
the disciplinary facilities at an

Assault
ROTC

move Africans to action when
the works of such men as Leo-
pold Senghor, Sakou Toure, and
Kwame Nkrumah are often un-
available to general student use?

A whole new realm of African
poetry and prose, both in Eng-
lish and in French, left usually
untouched in studies of Mod-
ern Literature, is a witness to
the intellectual movement of a
continent recently hurtled into a
new era of shaky independence
in. which strong feelings of na-
tionalism struggle unremitting-
ly against a version of unity.

To understand why this strug-
gle exists and to understand
what it means to the future not
only of Africa, but for the entire
world, a knowledge of African
people as a people. of their his.
tory, their religions, their phil-
osophies and their aspirations as
revealed in their new-born liter-
ture, can not be left inaccessible
and even unpromoted to young
Americans.

Africa is unwilling to let go
of. her newly achieved position
in world affairs and she won’t
let go to fall back into the
black. pit from whence she has
just arisen. She knows that she
has a role and she is willing to
play this role in spite of the
many trumps against her.

Africa is on the move. How
are its actions being revealed
to the students of Davidson Col-
lege—in the ignorance typical
of the past or with the compre-
hension necessary for the pres-
ent?

Dear Editor:

Fraternity men at Davidson
College should realize that it is
time for sweeping social changes
if anything like the fraternity
system jis to continue here.
These freshmen have been
around long enough to get their
feet on the ground and to be-
come members of the college
community without being in fra-
ternities.

They have had more fun and
elass spirit (and parties) than
any freshman class I have seen
without being in fraternities. In
short. they have adjusted, tiave
been accepted, and are socially
enjoying their stay at Davidson
College, all without being in fra-
ternities.

The more freshman I talk to
the more I am convinced that
they (along with many indepen-
dents and disenchanted frater-
nity men) are totally anoyed
with the artificiality of rush reg-
ulations and are not impressed
with the pseudo-aristocracy of
Greek letter fraternities at Dav-
idson. *

Certainly with the rise of the
Social Council it is no longer
socially necessary to be in a fra-
ternity. But several fraternities
here will be in dire financial
Straits if they don't get plenty
of pledges this year.

Therefore, fraternities, justi-
ly yourselves! Justify your-
selves or die a natural death.
Justify to these freshmen why
they should have to take a beat-
ing. wash  upper-class-men’s
cars, crowd into small rooms
and smoke cigars and eat raw
eggs until they throw up, waste
hours on senseless tasks, and
suffer all kinds of indignities
to prove they're good enough to

be accepted by the group.

Justify to these freshmen why
they should send off thousands
of dollars to national organiza.
tions from which they gain noth.
ing other than the prestige (?)
of being a certified Kappa Kap-
pa or whatever. .

And, above all, justify to these
freshmen why they should par:
ticipate in the moral Injustice
of the black ball system. Tell
them why it is necessary that
they be picked over like so
many oranges and have their
mouths checked to see if their
teeth are alright (sic) and then
to be passed on or rejected on
the basis of the size of their.
Adams’ apples by the whim of
one individual out of fifty.

Tell them that it is really
right for the college to plan
on and to support (financially
as well as morally) and to brag
on (in all the college literature)
our fraternities as the college
system in spite of the fact that
fraternities are not open to alt
students that come to Davidson
College. Explain to these fresh-
men that injustice is justice,
that black is white. Or!

Or face up to the fact of the
injustice and inefficiency of our
present system. Face up to the
fact that it is not necessary to
have a black ball system to have
fun, brotherhood, and social eat-
ing clubs in college.

Face up to the facts that the
freshmen realize this and that
you need them more than they
need you. And then forsake na-
tional charters and drop the ball
or at least modify it. Then to.
gether all Davidson students can
build a new social system based
on campus-wide brotherhood.

Such a system (at least as a
positive alternative to the fra-
ternity system) is already be-
ing started. There is a drive
already under way (under the
leadership of Joe Obenshain,
Jesse Sims, and others) to build
a non-exclusive seating club on
campus. All freshmen, in fact,
all students are invited to take .
part.

Meanwhile in the interest of
all that is right and in your
own best interests I ask, ad-
vise, dare all. freshmen to boy-
cott the blackball until some
changes are made.
