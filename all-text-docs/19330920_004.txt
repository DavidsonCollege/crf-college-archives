Vespers Are Begun
Again by Dr. Lingle

Impresses Upon Students the
Importance of Putting First
Things First

The Y. M. C. A. vesper services for |
the new year were fittingly opened
last Sunday evening’ by Dr. Walter L.
Lingle, president of the college. Lead-
ing the evening's devotion was Lynn
Iluie, with Carlton Chapman at the |
organ. The student congregation was |
led in prayer by W. M. Thompson, |
president of the “Y,” after which Mr
Chapman played an organ solo.

Dr. Lingle chose for the scripture
reading a passage from the sixth chap- |
ter of the Gospel of St. Matthew, cen-
tering his remarks on the nineteenth
through the twenty-first verses. His
talk revolved about the important task
of establishing that sense of values
which leads the individual to place
first things first, “Lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon the earth,

.. but lay up for yourselves treas-
heaven for where thy
treasure is, there will thy heart be
wrote the apostle in his letter
to the Christian world. From this rich |
selection, Dr. Lingle brought his hear- |
ers lessons that should grip the heart |
and will of every student as he faces |
the year lying now before him.

Two cases were used in exemplifying
the type that does not possess the
proper sense of values: one, the rich |
young ruler who visited the Master,
then returned to the oblivion whence
he came because he failed to place God
above riches; and the second, a broken
man who came to Dr. Lingle a few |
years ago in Atlanta who also depart-
ed unhelped because he would not let
God take the place of his sensual life.

These vesper services constitute the
chief spiritual expression of the stu-
dents as a student unit, and to these
meetings the “ Y” Cabinet cordially in-
vites both old and new men. Form
the vesper habit now.

Dr. Price H. Gwynn, coming back
to help in the full program starting a
new session at Davidson, will have a
chance to judge the truth of facts
learned at the conference of the Hazen
Foundation, held in Lisle, N. Y., this
summer.

Dr. Gwynn, after acting in the ab-
sence of Professor Fleagle in.ghe ca-
pacity of director of the summer
school, went to Montreat, N. C., where
he lectured for a two weeks’ period in
the Assembly’s. Training School.

It was after this work that Dr.
Gwynn encountered what he considers
the most beneficial part of his sum-
mer. He was invited, along with 59
other college professors from all over
the East, to attend a conferences for
those interested on student counselling.

Dr. Gwynn served while at the con-
ference on the executive committee,
also appearing on the program at va-
rious times.

This convention is sponsored by the
Hazen Foundation, headed by Mr.
Edward Hazen, former official of the
Curtis Publishing Company. Mr. Ha-
zen, who. had not the advantages of a
college education himself, had accumu-
lated rather a large fortune, and want-
ed to use it where it would do the
most good,

He had observed that there was
rather a strained personal relation be-
tween the student and the majority of
his professors. Consequently, he be-
came greatly interested in developing
closer personal relations between stu-
dents and faculty members at liberal
arts colleges, and left a part of his
fortune to this end.

As Dr. Gwynn reports, this work is
becoming interesting in the ideas
which it brings forth, and he believes
that a great deal of good might be
done by the convention if it is fol-
lowed through in the correct manner.

day, during which time fraternities will
maintain a ‘silence towards Freshmen
and no rushee will enter a fraternity
house.

Bids will be issued through the post
office and at 7.0'clock p. m., all bidded
Freshmen will go to their rooms. If
a rushee has received an invitation to
join more than one of -the social or-
ganizations, then two members from
each fraternity sending him a bid will
be permitted to fifteen minutes alone
with the rushee after the end of the
silence period.

If the invited Freshman wishes to
join a fraternity, from which he has
received a bid, he will go alone and
appear at that organization’s house at
9 o'clock p. m., when he will be pledged

and permitted to wear a pledge pin.

SILVER SCREEN

Wednesday, Sept. 20-—-Torch Singer

This is the latest picture that has
been made starring Claudette Colbert.
She is shown as the torch-singing en-
tertainer in a Broadway night, club.
The part does not, or would not, seem
to fit the star very well, but with her
voice and her acting, she does very
well in the show.

Thursday, Sept. 21 —Rafter Romance

Ginger Rogers is the down and out
gitl who is put in the attic room to
share it with Norman Foster, who
works at night while works at
day. They form an intense disliking
without knowing each other, and then
meet and fall in love away from the

22—Pilgrimage

As the title suggests, the story is one
of a mother who makes one of the
Gold Star Mother trips to the grave
of her son in France. The thought is
good, and Henrietta Crosman plays

Saturday, Sept. 23—Te The Last Man
The most recent and one of the best
of the “forgotten” western pictures.
The pure western style, though, is
somewhat removed by the presence in
the cast of Randolph Scott, Esther
Ralston, Buster Crabbe, Jack LaRue,
and the. comedy inserted by Noah
This does very well for one
of Zane Grey's finest stories.

Monday, Sept. 25—Beauty For Sale

Madge Evans stars in this attempt
at dramatics. The story is not wholly
dramatic, though, as in parts, Una
Merkel puts in an .appearance and
livens the story. Rated as one of the
best of the very newest pictures pro-
duced,

Tuesday, Sept. 26—Another Language

Robert Montgomery as the husband |

of the bride, Helen Hayes. The story
is very heavy with famtily unrest, and
Louise Closser Hale, in her last pic-

been roommates, and this adds |

ture, plays the part of the jealous
mother very well. John Beal, as the
father, also does superb acting. The
bride is bewildered when brought into
this household, but manages to finally
straighten her husband and reconcile
the family picture, with her great act-
ig ability. Helen Hayes and John
Beal are especially outstanding
their acting.
