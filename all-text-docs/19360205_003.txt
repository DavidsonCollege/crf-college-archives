Luckless Freshmen Are Snow-
balled From All Sides

A heavy blanket of snow arrived
at Davidson Jast Wednesday night,
January 29, as an uninvited guest
for the Pan-Hellenie Couneil’s set
of Mid-winters’ dances.

“Cokey” Branton, president of
the Pan-ITellenic Council. was seen
wandering about the campus, mum-
bling to himself and apparently try-
ing to find some way to pay Fred-
dig, Martin for ten hours’ worth of
dance music. The whole _ thing
looked mighty bad for the Council
members, but Herb Willis waggseen
guarding an apparently” precious
box of money on Saturday night’
and carrying a sinile of content-

The entire student body seemed
to be ina playful mood, and Thurs-
day turned out to be a night-mare
for the luckless freshmen who
drew unexpected volleys of snow-
balls from all sides when they ven-
tured out .from the safety of their
dormitories. Then several groups
turned to making snow-men, the
most imposing of which was the
statue of some distinguished gentle-
man erected by Bill Quick and
Maurice Peabody.
