_ Artists Supersede

(Continued from page 9) \,

Natural law has given way
before the relativity of
situation ethics, and the con-
sequent confusion in human
relationships is leading to the
end of our traditional ideas of
the Individual.

Likewise, universally
recognized standards of what
is a*‘proper”’ or “‘successful’”’
work of art have given way
before the new cult of ‘“‘per-
machange,” an ever-receding
avant-garde that perpetuates
obsolescence.

If art of works of art were
completely self-sufficient,
then the condition of ever-cha-
nging standards would not

hamper its chances of sur-
vival. ;
Just as the full impact of
lativism ‘will destroy the
idividual by the erosion
eo elimin lation of all
thorif V in socie ty, our once
passionate response to works
of f art will grow cold. Indeed,

how many of us are capable of
a vital response to Herb
Jackson’s show currently
hanging in Stowe Galleries?

The lack of vital response by
the mass of viewers to new
works of art today is evidence
that the relationship between
work and viewer is being
eroded.

(Possibly by the very nature
of our ificreased pace of life in
an urbanized, industrial
society that deprives us of the
time necessary to appreciate

by flooding our leisure hours -

with more diversions than we
can handle.)

The increasing lack of vital

response actually results from
the inability of people to
become experienced with and
have an awareness of a work
of art as it relates to those
works which preceded it and
those which are contemporary

with it, and what the aesthetic _

problems are that are being
confronted in them.

Only the ‘‘expert’’ who
devotes his life to the study of
art is in a good position to see
this significance. He un-
derstands the relationships of

individual works with each.

other better than most people
do.

Response is thus relative to
how much experience viewers

have, and as experience.
requires a great deal of time,
expense, and study, the chan
ces of the audience becoming
better Vv ith he

acquainted
lightning-fast growth of the
modern tradition in ;
reduced

If the comprehension of the
ever-growing tradition of art
today is sufficiently removed
from the-experience of most
people then art as it is known
today will cease to satisfy any
natural, intellectual, or
aesthetic desires of ;these
people, and consequently for
them it will no longer have any
value or exist as a work of art.

Modern art by nature will
come to exist as art only for an
e perienced elite.

Anything’s better than what

...Centrex System Examined

(Continued from page'5) '

“Southern Bell wastes many
labor hours and money (their
own and students’) by in-
stalling, taking out, and rein-
stalling phones every year.’
The calculation from the
survey of the number of
phones installed and the num-
ber of phones with long cords
revealed that thus far this
year Davidson students have
paid $3,360 for installation of
phones which would not have

Another Davidson student
responded: ‘‘We have had
problems with our phone since
it’s been installed. We have
had people to work on it four
times and it is still not entirely
satisfactory. We are forced to
pay ridiculous prices, but we
don’t have much choice since
it is a monopoly also forcing us
to accept poor service.”’
