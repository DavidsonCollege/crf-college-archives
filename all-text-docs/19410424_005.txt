Janitor Tells,

Story Of Life

By Jim Stimson

“All mi lif’ [I’ve spent in Davi'-
son,” says Enoch Donaldson, the
old. negro janitor who works in
Chambers. “I've had no. other

home, but Dav’son, and I'm aiming
to stay here.” :

This briefly summarizes Enoch’s
love for the town of Davidson and
the college. Enoch days that his
earliest jobs were in connection
with the college.

Many years ago when Davidson
had no. steam-heated—dormitories
Enoch says he went around with
Hotzclow (a janitor) and learned
to make the fires in the room of

the students. At that time’ boys
were rooming in Oak and Elm
Rows.

The father of this writer says

that all the boys remember Enoch

well. “He would come around, and
my roommate and I would sling
shoes at him as he came in to

build our fire.” If any of the pre-
sent Davidson students had a fath-
er here, go see Enoch ‘and see if
he does not remember him.

Looking further back into the
past, Enoch says that he, remem-
bes when Dr. Sentelle was a student
at the college. “At dat tim’ I was
a little.boy an’ visited the campus
of’en.”

“When Dr.
was pres'dent,

(1888-1901)
I waited in the
pres’dent’s home. ‘Den come Dr.
Henry Louis Smith — (1901-1912)
while I was wuking for the college:
Ag’in I waited in the pres'dent’s
home when Dr. Martin (1912-1929)
was pres'dent.”

K. J. Foreman
Gives Sunday
School Talk

Foreman Say Unity, Truth,
And Love Are Marks of

Dr. Kenneth J. Foreman addres-
sed the Student Sunday School on

April 20. His topic was The Holy
Spirit

Dr. Foreman first indication the
erroneous name of the Book of
Acts. It, through numerous early
manuscripts lost its rightful title.
Since in the. New Testament the

Holy Spirit is the most important
thing, it should be called The Acts
of the Holy Spirit.

Although the Holy Spirit is
mentioned throughout the Bible, it
nowhere defined. Dr. Foreman
defines it thus: The Holy Spirit is
God at work in History and the
Life and Experiences of Mankind.
Everywhere. the Holy Spirit is
named God can be substituted.

Dr. Foreman next, asked the
question: What are the marks of
Holy Spirit? He used this
illustration. Life and Electricity
are undefineable-unseen. We, how-
ever, see their effects. And so with

1s

the Holy Spirit.

There are three main marks of
the Holy Spirit: Unity-shown
through Ghristians united; Truth-
three times in Jesus’ last message
to his desciples Jesus calls the
Spirit, the Spirit of Truth-what-

ever is not of the Spirit; Love-in

it you see something of God.

Dr. Foreman also pointed out
that the Holy Spirit inspires true
Christian gifts.

The final thought expressed by
Dr, Foreman was that God does to
only those who wish to have it
done. God's spirit comes where it

is invited.
