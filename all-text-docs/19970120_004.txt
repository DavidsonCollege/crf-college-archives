Outpost receives
another facelift

By IAN HUMMEL
Staff Writer

Over the holidays, the Union
Outpost was given a minor facelift,
which included the addition of three
new booths as well as a new tile
floor. Also, the latticed partition
was removed from in front of the
ordering counter.

Dennis Rice, the Outpost man-
ager, says these most recent im-
provements are part of a continu-
ing effort to make the Outpost a
nicer and more comfortable place
to which students will want to go
for an hour, Rice said. Also, ac-
cording to Rice, the hope is that
“by making the place look nicer,
the students will treat it nicer.”

Other changes made this school
year include the addition of the
stage and the glass near the en-
trance way.

In the coming weeks, there
are plans to place a big screen TV
in the Outpost in addition to some
other smaller improvements that
will be made.

Rice credited a collaborative
effort from Dean Shandley, Assis-
tant Director for Operations Mike
Goode, Union director William
Brown, and Carpentry Shop
superviser Sam Westmoreland for
the improvements. Rice said that
they have all been pleased with the
work, as have been the students
who have come to eat at the Out-
post since the changes were made.

Proposals include an appelate process and non-endorsement clause

equal rights and responsibilities
under the Davidson College Con-
stitution, the Honor Code, of Re-
sponsibility, the Code of Disci-
plinary Procedure, the academic
regulations of Davidson College,
and these SGA Bylaws.”

The nondiscrimination policy
states, “Davidson College admits
qualified students and administra-
tors all educational and employ-
ment activities without discrimi-
nation because of race, color, reli-
gion, national origin, age, disabil-
ity, sex, or sexual orientation ex-
cept where exemption is appropri-
ate and allowed by law.”

Buford also charge the Com-

mittee to create an appellate pro-
cess by which an organization
denied a charter may petition-the
Senate to “reconsider its decision,
” according to the proposal.
Buford considers this suggestion
very important to the revision of
the chartering process.

The organization would ap-
peal to the Senate Executive Com-
mittee (SEC), “provid[{ing] all in-
formation required to receive a
charter and justification for re-
questing the Senate to reconsider
its decision.” The SEC then would
“forward the charter request to the
full Senate with a recommenda-
tion” or deny the request.

The SEC is composed of the
SGA President, Vice-President,

Chancellor, Treasurer, and the class
presidents.

A final addition proposed by
the committee states that “the grant-
ing or renewing of a renewable
charter by the S.G.A. is not an
endorsement of the organization
receiving the charter, its member-
ship, or its beliefs held in com-
mon.”

Buford charged the Commit-
tee to make the changes in re-
sponse to last year’s confusion and
controversy regarding the rechar-
tering of Inter-Varsity Christian
Fellowship (IVCF).

Buford stresses that the
committee’s proposed bylaws
changes are not aimed at IVCF in
particular, but instead the changes

will make clearer the requirements
needed to gain or retain a charter.

“The major reason to give
[IVCF] its charter [last year was]
because the bylaws did not state
clearly what the major criteria were
for an organization to get a char-
ter,” Buford says. We did this with
the idea that it would be fair for the
SGA and the chartering organiza-
tions.”

Buford adds that this will not
eliminate all the gray areas from
the chartering process. “SGA
members will still have to interpret
lawful, unlawful, just, unjust dis-
crimination,” he says.

An SGA charter entitles an
organization, according to the pro-
posed bylaws, to: “official status

within the Davidson College com-
munity and may represent itself
outside the community;” to “re-
quest funds from the SGA Trea-
sury through the Senate;” and to “a
higher priority in the scheduling of
campus facilities than an unchar-
tered organization.”
