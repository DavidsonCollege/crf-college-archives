After much debate, international students set SGA seat

By NARESH NAGELLA
Associate News Eitor

There’s a new representative
in town for the SGA. Last week the
SGA gave permission to the Inter-
national Student Association (ISA)
to have a voting Senator speak for
their interests at student govern-
ment meetings.

The ISA previously had a non-
voting representative.

The SGA allowed the ISA to
join with a final vote of 24-7, more
than the three-fourths margin
needed to allow a new member to
join.

The SGA had tabled the issue
after prolonged debate last week
and then discussed for more than
one hour this week.

_ At issue was whether the ISA
could really count 4s a social orga-
nization and whether their needs
were not being met by independent
or Patterson Court representatives.

“It is a dangerous precedent if
we give any chartered organization
that represents a specific part of the
student body a seat,” said non-SGA
member junior Eric Sapp. “I don’t
see how we can deny IVCF, FLAG
or any other such Organization. 4 a
seat if the ISA gets one.”

Senior Class President Tim
Saintsing responded to Saap’s ar-
gument. “The ISA deserves a vote
because the by-laws do not define
what a social organization is,” he

says.

Saintsing believes that almost
any organization can apply for a
seat if the bylaws are not made
more specific.

Freshman Joe Hayworth
thought the situation to be a special
case.“It is not a dangerous prece-
dent when we encourage diversity.
The ISA is owed this right to have a
voting voice. They have come to
meetings for the last five years,” he

says.

Senior Class President Saad
Gul stressed that the ISA was not
asking for representation out of
political correctness but because
there was a real need.

“There are specific needs of
international students that are not
being met.

The College has difficulty deal-
ing with health insurance, car insur-
ance, and other special matters that
an international student needs help
in solving,” he says.

Former ISA representative
Regina Marranzini did not feel that
non-voting status is enough to ex-

press those needs.

“How worthy is an opinion that
does not have a vote? I always felt
like my opinions were not being
considered properly, like they were
token,” she says.

When the vote finally occurred,
ISA representative Toh Hean Ch’ng
said, “I am really happy everything
worked out well. Now, we have to
meet our new challenges.”

It has not been decided which
one of ISA’s 70 or more members
will be the new senator. Ch’ng ex-
pects a vote to happen soon.

The vote now gives the SGA a
total of 37 voting representatives.

Wow. My word. Hoo-doggy.
These are just a few of the
thoughts that occurred to me at
8:07 last Friday evening in Love
Auditorium, as the Gala Benefit
players sounded the opening aria

Weichet nur, betriibte Schatten,
BWV 202.

the week of the Vail Music Resi-
dency, bringing together all twelve
“masters” along with internation-
ally acclaimed soprano Sylvia
McNair for a concert by German
masters of the 18th and 19th centu-
ries. (In case you were wondering
about the program note typo: no,
Franz Schubert was not born in
1979).

Writing a review about sucha
performance is problematic. What
high points to select; what per-
formers to congratulate when the
entire evening seemed to meacon-
tinuous show of flawless musician-
ship?

Of course Joe Robinson courted
listeners with the delicate oboe ob-
bligato in the fourth aria, while
maintaining a sensitive and defer-
ential role to the vocal part as only
a true master could accomplish.
And Sylvia MeNair. Of course
a brief reading of her listed creden-

artistic devotion. What could I, the
musical peon, have to say intelli-
gently about such an evening?

Well, of course, I did have my
favorites.

Two works captivated me in
particular. First, the Trio in E-flat
Major for Horn, Violin, and Piano,
Op. 40, by Johannes Brahms (to be
played, incidentally, this Tuesday
evening in Hodson Hall at the
“Loud” concert). The passion and
sense of urgency pouring from this
performance brought the audience
to its feet at the piece’s close for the
first time in the concert. Pianist
Christopher O’ Riley deserves extra
kudos for performing so fervently
despite the head injury inflicted

concert by a hasty Chambers-goer
(or, more accurately, by a hastily-
pushed Chambers door).

Franz Schubert’s Der Hirt auf
dem Felsen, D. 965, for soprano,
clarinet, and piano, was next up on
my favorites. Ms. McNair showed
an astounding versatility of expres-
sion; at times her voice could be
lithe and delicately coy, while at
other moments oc pai steers

“Is you is, or is you ain’t, my baby?” McNair

feat given the auditorium’s dry

The evening’s concert served |-

to raise funds for music scholar-

tors were treated to two hours of
music that seemed natural and ef-
fortlessly exquisite, its emotion

The year in
review

At any college, things leave
and things enter. To some this

might sound too simple for

de-
scribes the 1996-1997 school year.
The College underwent major
changes and major losses in the past
29 weeks. Here are some...

Of course, the year began with
the class of ‘96 gone and the class of
‘00 here, representing the first of a °
new century of Davidsionians.

Kegs completely left the court,
and BYOB started. “Only nine
beers per person of drinking age’’ is

the new rule.

Fifty dollar parking stickers
left, and eighty dollar parking tick-
éts entered —the police department’s
way of inaugurating the new school
year.

The main computer center left
its old home on Main Street and
relocated in Belk.

Davidson vaulted from num-
ber eighteen on the U.S. News and
World Report rankings and clawed
its way to number eleven.

Hurricane Fran did not visit us,
but Jane Goodall did, She packed
Love, Auditorium with a sold out

‘speech in which she detailed her

scientific accomplishments,

The old “Check Chal” com-
puters left the library, and the World
Wide Web downloaded Davidson
into the 21st century.
