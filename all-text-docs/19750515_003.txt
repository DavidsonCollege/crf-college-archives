The Bavidssntan e

Three

Workshops spark off-cam

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Staff Writer

Two Life-Experience Planning
Workshops were conducted by the Ex-
periential Program Office in April;
these workshops mark the beginning of
an important new thrust for experiential
learning experiences at Davidson.

Director of Experiential Learning Ken
Wood explained the reason for the
workshops. ‘‘They were begun in
response to a problem that seemed to
appear-as students came down and wan-
ted to have an off-campus experience,
but weren’t sure how it fit into their
lives.”

Wood contacted Dr. Edward Golden, a
friend he met at Princeton Seminary, to
direct the workshops. Golden received
his PHD from Columbia University and
works with a _ group. called
Organizational Renewal Associates.
When Wood contacted Golden, he
discovered that Golden was a graduate
from Davidson in the class of 1947.

Two groups participated in the
workshops held at Erwin lodge on two
weekends in April—the freshman class
of North Carolina Fellows and a later
group of interested students.

Also, a number of administrators and
faculty participated, including Dean of
Students Will H. Terry, Professor of
Religion Sam D. Maloney, Professor of
Economics Randall R. Kincaid,
Professor of Psychology John D. Kelton
and Secretary” of Experiential
Programs Suzie Summers.

Golden sent three tests for par-

ticipants to take before the workshops —

began. These were scored and placed in

the participants hands during the
workshops.

Personality tests

The tests were geared ‘‘not so much to
find problems as they were to find
strengths,” according to Wood.

In addition to data from the tests, par-
ticipants generated data about them-
selves in other areas; by the end of this
data gathering stage, they had explored
about 15 areas, including ae toe and
ideas concerning personality, needs,
roles, values, interests, types of
vocational preference, talents, traits,
ambitions options and norms.

These data largely were indications
about how participants saw themselves
rather than how they were viewed by

Wood explained, “tt was helpful for
them to know whether they were °in-
troverts or extroverts (in their own
eyes). ”

‘All this data was then cnassaged, "he
continued. ‘‘It gave a student a clearer
sense of who he is. It was really sur-
prising to me to find how liberating it
was for the students,’” Wood added. The
self-evaluations and the group
discussions of them gave each par-
ticipant a chance to view himself from a
new angle. »

He or she could gain a clearer un-
derstanding of his character, talents
and goals by projecting them off of other
people. Also, the workshop gave par-
ticipants a chance to realize similar
talents, questions, problems and goals
in fellow participants.

Mr. Golden’s methods

Terry commented about his ex-
periences in the workshop, ‘“‘In light of
my own previous experiences and the
experiences of some students, I liked
particularly the way Mr. Golden and
perhaps his method interpreted the
tests.”’

The dean of students added that the
workshop was based on the positive,
stressing strengths instead of
weaknesses. Terry concluded that such
a procedure helps people be less_defen-
sive about being tested and therefore
allows the tests to be more useful to
them.

Because of the success of these
workshops, Wood plans to sponsor them
regularly in the future. ‘We plan to offer
this kind of thing at least once each
term,” he said. The workshops will be
optional, but Wood thinks that an in-
tensive program for freshmen and
sophomores would be particularly worth-
while.

“It’s our philosophy down here (in the
Experiential Programs Office in Cham-
bers) that students ought to grasp and
maintain initiative (in selecting
vocational experiences).

Needs and wants

“‘They should be helped by the college
to know enough about themselves and
their world so that they can pursue what
they want and what they need,’’ Wood
commented.

“I see this kind of self analysis leading
to carefully planned off-campus ex-
periences,’’ he added.

@-
Bs interests

Wood working

Students who participated in the first
two workshops found them to be
valuable experiences. Wood said that
the freshmen and _ sophomores
especially thought that the workshops
came at a crucial time in their lives.
Participants agreed that the workshops
should be made available to other
students.

Effective planning

Terry believes that the workshops
provide a means for students to plan
their years at Davidson more effectively
and to receive help with their own
vocational struggles.

Both Wood and Terry think that the
workshops are just as potentially useful
for faculty members and administrators
as they are for students. Wood com-
mented, ‘I think that this may be the
kind of thing that would enhance the.
total functioning of the College.”

He had. asked faculty and ad-
ministrators to participate initially so

that they could help with future
workshops, but he believes that the
program can be valuable on a personal
level,also.

Long-Range Planning Committee

Terry commented, ‘‘It was successful
for me personally; it gave me some in-
sights into myself. I just sat there and
felt that if more faculty and particularly
administrators could get the benefit of
the personality inventory, we could be
more helpful to one another in our
strengths.”

Terry added that workshops like the
life experience planning program would
be valuable for task oriented groups. He
mentioned the -Range Planning.
Committee as an example.

Mark Connors fills new office. Assistant to
the Vice President for Development.

By JOHN WOOD
Staff Writer

There is a new. office on cam-
pus and graduating senior Mark
Connors has been selected to fill
it.

The office, Assistant to the
Vice President for Develop-
ment, has. no_ stringent
prerequisites but does
necessitate a general ability to
write, an interest in staying
around Davidson and a toleran-
ce for some detailed and
seemingly trivial work.

Vice President for Develop-
ment Craven Williams told Con-
nors that the job would include
him jin the preparation com-
ponent of the three component
development program. This
will involve basic research and
writing funding proposals for
the college.

The three components include
solicitation, acknowledgment

on the job.

and preparation.

Connors, a psychology major,
had applied to the now. filled
position of Assistant to the
President.

“The day I had heard I was
turned down (as assistant to the
president) I heard about this
job,” remarked Connors.

The office was created by
Williams and finalized through
the office of the President of the
College Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

“I feel very comfortable
doing that sort of work (ad-
ministrative),”’ | commented
Connors who has worked with
the president and Dean of a
Students Will H. Terry. He has
also worked as hall counselor
and freshman advisor.

Connors is excited about this
position but ‘‘nebulous” about
its ramifications. He feels that
this will be cleared up as his
role in the office is determined,

to the president this office is a
permanent position. The
assistant to the president’s of-

year.

The office would also involve
extensive travel for preparing

Connors, who heard of his
selection to this office ap-
proximately a month ago, will
assume the position July first.
