CAT TALES

By TONI CASALI

By TONI CASALI

One thing that has traly been neglceted during the past few years
by this sports page is to pay tribute to one of Davidsonis most ardent ,
followers and one who really hos the Wildeat spirit. This happens so
be none other than Mr. White. Davidsonts faithiul wainer. It is almost
9 useless to say what good Mr. White has been to athletes on the campus.
He is almost a. tradition, inst like the man that preceded him, Doc Char-
“ley Mr. White has taken up where Doe Charley leit off, He is the’,
first one to help an iniured athlete and it is up to him to get the iniured |
one back in shape and this he does. without a whimper. Desides af
this he looks after the ficld. gym, or what have y L think we all |
ought to give him a hand. don't von? I

ou.
—" This week's proverbial orehids go to Coach Spcarman, who prob-
ably has the distinetion of coaching the team with the best secord of any
for the year. Nis irash cindermen have los: only one meet out of five

scheduled. This is truty’ a record. and perhaps the best one ever enjoyed
by a freshman team.

°

Along with Spearman, orchids should also be handed to Heath !
Whittle. intra-mural sports director for presenting the student body
with a well-dalareed intra-mural program, The program this year proved ;
to be especially popuiar, and the students showed their interest in the |
Program by presenting some classy teams that pat up close races in the

different sports. i

Davidson's bestball nine gained sweet revenge last Thursday when
they sec Catawba's slugging Indians back 4 to 3, thereby proving that
the overwhelming deieat of the boys from Salisbury handed them cartier
in tha season was somewhat of an upset. Eddie Steere pitched one of
the sweettst games of his career and also aided the cause with several
nice hits to his credit. The team also played better defensive ball and
continued to do so in the next game with XN. C. State. And speaking of
the State game, Eddie Berlinski, slugging Wolf centeriielder. certainly
must not be “living right.” He caught one of Hayseed Thomas’ slow ones
and rode it right over the left field tence with plenty of room to spare.
But the ching aboin it was that the “i! omened” agate curved and went
over the ience on the wong side of the foul dine. That's tough.

_ Several complaints have been raised to the fact that the tennis
courts on the campus are not kept in top shape. Surely with one of the
finest tennis teams in the state-one that boasts of a good record—
they should be afforded with good, playing grounds: The courts have
not heen up to par with those of other schools, even smaller schools. It
should be looked atter.

With exams pas: around the corner, sporis happenings are coming
to a standstill tor the year and Thursday at che chapel hour the aniual
athlete day will be held.

Ac this time the imter-class, inter-iraternity wrestling. decathlon,
> gymnastic. and intra-mural high scorer trophies wilt be presented. There
»has been unusually keen competition for all these trophies this year with

the junior class. probably running off with the interclass honors and

the Fijis with the interirat cup. Other winners have vot been named
-as yet.

__ RAMBLING NOTES: Bailey Williams, hetty football captain has
