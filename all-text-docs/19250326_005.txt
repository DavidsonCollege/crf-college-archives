Springfield Republican, a paper that for
much of the period has had national, and
even international, fame for its character,
ability, and influence. It was founded
1824 by Samuel Bowles, and was carried on
by his son and grandson of the same name.
They were a trio unique in American news-
paper history. The record of their experi-
ences in striving for their ideals of public
service makes an epic of rare interest.”

H. Pratt, of Louisville, conducting the meet- |
ings. Dr. Pratt is a former missionary, and
just before being called to Louisville held an
important pastorate in Montgomery, Ala. He
is a forceful and energetic speaker, and will
bring great and helpful messages to assist
men in finding their life work, their places
in life’s battle line. Buck Currie, former
Davidson student body president, baseball
pitcher, and “Y" secretary, and Bob Me-
Leod, former Glee Club president and man-
ager of Quips and Cranks, will be with Doe-
tor Pratt to assist him in the services. Spc-
cial music will be furnished at each meeting,
Doctor Pratt will speak at the chapel each
morning, and will also speak each evening
after supper. These life-work services have
always been the most inspiring and most
popular services of the year and have al-
ways been a great help to the students. The
services this year, with Doctor Pratt speak-
ing and Buck and Bob assisting, stand fair
to become the most popular, helpful and far-
reaching ever held at Davidson,

Doctor Pratt now occupies the chair of
Missions and Evangelism at the Louisville
Theological Seminary, at Louisville, Ky. He
is a graduate of King College, where he
made an enviable record, being the star of
the football team for several years and one
of the leaders in campus activities. After
graduating from King, Dr. Platt: served as
a missionary to Korea for several years, re-
turning to America to take the pastorate of
the Central Presbyterian Church, in) Mont-

ued his diligent work:

Doctor Pratt is also an ardent worker in
the Laymen’s Movement,
which he has contributed his @valuable aid
many times. He is also very active in the
work of the Federated Association of
Churches, and has done a great deal of work
in this line. He has a very magnetic per-
sonality and has been very popular at all the |
places he has spoken. The Southern Church
considers him to be the outstanding orator
of the Southern Presbyterians. With his

REVEREND YATES TO SPEAK
TO VOLUNTEER MEETING

The Reverend Mr. Yates, of Missouri,

|returned missionary from China, spoke

to the Volantger Band at their last meet-
ing, and was heard with much interest.
Mr. Yates told of the work of the mis-
sionaries in China, the difficulties they
have to work under and overcome. His
talk was strongly impressive. He was in-
troduced by W. B. Rice. J. A. McAlpine
led the singing and Paul Patterson led
the meeting in prayer.

The flock of 240 sheep kept at the
Stanford University for the last ten
years, is a self-supporting body. Not on-
ly do they serve as an efficient lawn
mowing combine, but at, each semi-
annual shearing they yield approximate-
ly $350 worth of wool.
