Who Wants a Poor Thing Right on Time ?
Who Wants a FINE Thing TOO LATE?

The best printing obtainable and a service
| just as good. We give both quality and
service and charge for both. The service
| is gencrally as valuable as the effectiveness

of the work done. Let us convince you

ed through men who carry out his work
on earth. Dr, Whaling treated four as-
pects of the choice of the disciples.

In the first place Jesus made the
choice. ‘The responsibility of the choice
is thus shown, Each person should be
prepared to heed the call which God
gives him. “he saddest thing that could
happen would be to receive a call and
not heed it.

Another point, brought out was the
great privilege these men enjoyed upon
being chosen disciples. Just as a teacher
makes his school what it is so did Jesus
make his disciples what they were. The
call which God gives men is no louder
than the acknowledgement of his word.
The greater responsibilities will rest on
those who are best able to bear them.

The unlikeness of the twelve disciples
was necessary in order to cover the
breadth and scope of Christ’s mission.
The world would be a very dreary place
in which to live if all men were alike in
their habits and modes of living. Just
such would have been the case of the
twelve had they all been alike. Christ
develops each man according to his hab-
its and ability.

Finally Christ chose men who were
otherwise unknown, This clearly shows
the responsibility resting on each indi-
vidual to do his part however small.
Christ is the one supreme model. In the
life of each two calls came, the one the
call to the church; the other a call to ser-
vice—Each must in some way answer
these calls,

SIGMA UPSILON _ INITIATES
NEW MEN.

At a recent meeting of the Blue Pen-
cil chapter of Sigma (third) Upsilon
fraternity the following men from the
Junior class were initiated: W. F. Hall,
Jr., A. L. Wilson, Jr., S. H. Askew, H.
B. Brown, D. W. Roberts and J. W.
Witherspoon.

The costumes in which the new mem-
bers appeared for initiation were well
gotten up and the selections which they
offered were highly entertaining. After
the initiation refreshments were served,
which were enjoyed by all present.

It is a matter of especial notice that in
every department of applied science we
have to deal with the unseen, All forces,
whether in physics, mechanics, or elec-
tricity are invisible—A. Mackay.
