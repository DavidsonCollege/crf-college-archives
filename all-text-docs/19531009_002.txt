What Price Honor?

Honor is one of those things that it is easier to talk about
then to define; and once defined it is even more difficult to
draw up a set of rules by which to administer a code based
upon it.

But for many years the Student -Council has been ad-
ministering, and administering reasonably well, that part of
the Constitution, which we call the Honor System.

Davidson has gained something of a reputation for the
way her Honor System works, and we have every reason to
believe that it will continue to work, not just through this
year, but as long as there is a college called Davidson.

In the past honest disputes have arisen over the inter-
pretation of the System, for the code itself is, of necessity,
broad. Therefore we commend heartily the attempt of this
year’s Student Council to present a stricter and more con-
crete definition of the Honor System than is contained in the
Constitution.

Nevertheless, we feel compelled to take issue with the
Council's interpretation of exactly what comes under the
Honor System as pledged work.

According to the statement made by Council Lyman Kiser
in the recent meeting of the student body, all written work,
pledged or not, which is to be considered as the individual
work of the student in question comes under the rules laid
down by the Honor System as defined in the Student Body
Constitution.

Now it cannot be denied that such an interpretation is in
accord with the highest concept of what the Honor System
should be, but in our opinion, even this interpretation leaves
some loose ends.

It appears that under this interpretation it would be
necessary in many instances for the professor to state whether
certain work has to be the student’s own, or whether help was
to be permitted, which they are not always in the habit of
doing. Of course, in the case of writs, reviews, or exams, no
such statement would be necessary, since it has always been
assumed that the honor system applies to these.

Would it not be simpler if the professor should merely
ask that the pledge be written and signed on all work on which
he wishes the students to refrain from giving or receiving aid.
The fact that the pledge was not required by the professor
would be taken to mean that the Honor System did not apply
to that piece of work, and the student could seek help if he
needed it.

Sometimes professors do not mind in the least if a stu-
dent seeks help on some written work, especially the sort
that is to be done outside of class. In many instances two heads
are better than one. On the other hand if it is desirable that
a student not get or give any sort of aid, the professor could
merely ask for the pledge.

What could be a mere straightforward or reasonable in-
terpretation of the Honor System than that it applies only to

“work on which the pledge is required, and does not apply
‘unless the pledge is requested.

This would remove any shadow of a doubt as to where the
honor code is in effect, and would prove much less confusing
than if the system were applied to all work considered to be
the work of only the student in question, with no outside aid.

The latter instead of clarifying the Honor System seems
to us rather to confuse it.

A Step Forward

The passing of the late and unlamented aggregate cut
system should cause little mourning in the rank and file of
the student body.

It has long been one of the chief points of criticism in

the present cut set up here at Davidson, and its removal will
without doubt make the entire system considerably more
palatable.
_ Certainly the faculty is to be commended for cutting out
this seemingly needless appendage which has often been a
source of needless red tape and confusion, both to the student
and to those who were administering it.

In fact, the principle reason given by the dean’s office for
its abolition was that it entailed too many difficulties and ad-
ministrative details to serve whatever purpose for which it
was originally intended.

Needless to say, many misunderstandings grew out of
the difficulty encountered by the person keeping the records
in ascertaining whether a violation of the cut system had been
committed or was in the offing.

Under the present setup, only first semester freshmen
and upperclassmen under the penalty of freshman cuts will

have an aggregate cut limit lower than the total number of
class cuts.

Some of course, will appear to profit more than others,
but under the new rule no one stands to lose. We think its one
of the best things that could have happened to the much-
maligned cut system.

Davidson’s Paternalism Scored;
Responsibility Not Developed

It was down behind Johnston
Gym a couple of years ago duking
the Southern Conference tennis
tournament that Derrick Barton,
the genial Englishman who was
then coaching Davidson’s netmen,
was talking about the possibility
of getting a promising young prep
school tennis star to go to school
here. Whereupon a bystander, one
of the University of North Caro-
lina's players straightfacedly re-
marked, “Ah, he doesn’t want to go
to Davidson, Derrick. The boy’s
already been to prep school for
four years.”

The assertion that Davidson is
only a glorified prep school is one
that has been made for years, and
there is probably. no criticism of
this college that arouse the ire of
Davidson patriarchs any faster. It
is, however, generally the tone of
this accusation and not the actual
criticism which angers the
Through-and-Through-Davidsonian.

Prep School Characteristics

For it is undeniably true that
Davidson has at least a few of
the strongly paternalistic char.
acteristics of .the preparatory
school. The prevailing philosophy
of this college, it seems to me, is
not to develop responsibility in
the student by showing him the
way and giving helpful hints and
guidance as he goes through his
four years here, but rather to fas-
ten a leash around his neck and
lead him forcibly down the path
that the college fathers have de-
cided is the right one.

That is a strong charge, but one
which I believe can be substan.
tiated by the. facts. To begin with
Davidson's. cut system is one of
the strongest evidences of this pa-
ternalistic philosophy. 1 agree that
a boy fresh out of high school, and
with no idea of how important reg-
ular attendance at class is, should
be fairly strictly regimented. But
after a boy has been at Davidson}

THE POPCORN BAG

On all sides rose the towering,
gray giants of the Tetons, lifting
their massive heads to a white
fusion with infinity. Their green
coat gradually became shabby and
changed to an ermine mantle as I
sped up the narrow, curling road;
great jagged boulders leaned out
from the tops of cuts and peered
down at the tiny traveler below.
Tunnel after tunnel pierced the
mountain side, ephemerally blot-
ting out the brilliant haze of sun-
light that enveloped this new
world.

I stopped the car beside a rocky
slope and began to ascend on foot.
Up here the sir was rarer than
below and a sharp icy wind cut
through my thin jacket. The grade
was steep and my breath came
short and hard as I trudged along.
Tufts of grass dotted the way and
occasionally a stray piece of paper
fluttered across the semblance of
a path.

At last, fatigued, I sat down on
a rock beside a large patch of
snow, scooped up a handful and

for a year, he knows that a stu-
dent can’t éxpect to make the
grade without regular attendance
at class. (if he can do all right
without going to class, it seems
obvious that the professor is not
worth listening to, or that there
has been ao violation of the hono
system.)

Responsibility Not Developed
_ But instead of trying to develop
a sense of responsibility in the
student, after his trying freshman
year is over, Davidson continues
to dole out just a few more cuts
to: the upperclassman something
on the order of a reward to an
obedient child. .The natural re-
action of most ‘students is to seize
this privilege and use each of his
cuts with great relish, rather than
stop to consider whether he really
needs to use them.

The compulsory attendance at
worship services is another case
in point. I do not believe it is
possible to drill religion into any-
one; most students naturally rebel
at this sort of coercion. Yet the
authorities become upset when the
natural results of such coersion
are seen in the lack of reverence
at chapel, and to a lesser extent,
vespers. .

Another Example

The new policy of forcing fresh-
men to eat in the college union
is still another illustration. One of
the primary reasons advanced for
this policy was to promote class
spirit and unity, the value of which
1 fail to see. When the college
takes it upon itself to tell a stu-
dent where he must take his meals,
I hardly see how anyone could fail
to see that the prep school regi-
mentation is strongly prevalent.

There are a few other smaller
but nonetheless provoking  evi-
dences of this secondary school
type of regimentation, but these

turned and looked into a wrinkled
and worn, cooper-brown face.
“Howdy,” I said. The old fellow
nodded mechanically, climbed
down and seated himself beside
me. He was rather short of stature
and very thin; although he was
obviously well in years, he carried
himself stiffly erect. His hair was
straight and as black as his small,
glistening eyes.

We sat for a long time in silence
broken only by the cries of a stray
coney. He was staring absently at
a little blue-green lake several
hundred feet below us. “Small,
aren't they?” I ventured, pointing
to the cars on the ribbon-road
across the valley.

“Uh-huh ... whites in ‘em
smaller.” He still looked fixedly
at the lake.

“You resent the white man’s
being here?” I was still trying for
a conversation.

‘and critically surveys the David-

lieve, to prove my point. I do not
believe that anyone who honestly

son scene can fail to admit the
strongly prep schoolish atmosphere
prevalent on this campus. The
point at which there is room for
argument is that college students
need to be led down the path to
a diploma rather than shown and
advised as to the best route. It
seems to me that the former
method is quite appropriate for
boys still in their early teens, but
when a student reaches the col-
lege level I believe he should be
put on his own to at least a little
bit greater degree than this col-
lege does,

Necessary for Scholastic
Standing?

It will be maintained by Col-
lege authorities, and it may very
possibly be true, that the reason
Davidson does have such a good
name scholastically is because it
follows its present policy. David.
son has for years turned out more
than its proportionate share of
Rhodes scholars and leaders in the
various graduate schools through-
out the country. But I believe it
is also true that there are many
other schools in the country who
follow a much more liberal policy
than does Davidson, and have just
as good a scholastic standing.

T hope it will not be inferred that
I am advocating a large univer-
sity type of system, wherein the
student is only a number in the
crowd and the teacher very sel-
dom has the time even if he has
the desire to give the student the
individual attention he gets at Da-
vidson. But I do believe that there
is a middle ground between Da-
vidson's extreme paternalism and
the liberalism of a large univer-
sity, which if explored would
prove beneficial to future genera-

tions of Davidson students.

OFF-MOORINGS :

Not wishing to cross pens (or
reore accurately typewriters) with
a fellow writer so soon after the
first editorial efforts begin, espe-
cially since no offense is intended,
I hope the approach this week will
not appear to be criticizing an-
other man’s opinion.

It is the chapel conduct of the
Davidson student, of which I write,
and the article on this subject by
Dick Roper in last week’s paper.

Implied in Roper’s article, as it
has been in many another on this
disconcerting situation, is the true
basis of the problem, The actual
roots of this conduct have never
been to my knowledge brought in-
to printed light. They now de-
serve the attention which they de-
mand.

Let us recognize that the stu-
dents differ as individuals as much
as does their individual conduct in
chapel. Some sleep, some read,
some talk to others, some talk to
themselves, some listen, and others
just muse. As there is no mold
into which all students can be
poured as individuals so there is
no pattern of action which can be
expected of all of them.

In chapel, however, the group
is led in mass, is influenced in
mass, and most frequently reacts
in mass; therefore, the problem
must be judged as a situation in
which individuals are relegated to
less importance than that of the
group.

In other words, you have a mass
psychology at work— a mob

psychology frequently—and with it
the possibility of a mass purpose
expressing itself.

Now we ought to look at one
other important factor and we'll
be ready to understand the David.
son situation for what it actually
is.

To those who have even the
smallest inkling of what David-
son stands for, it is a relatively
simple matter to realize that the
pressure. to conform to the norm
are the most powerful forces that
are exerted here.

We are forced to adhere to a
prescribed curriculum that is
oftentimes much stricter than that
found in similar colleges and uni-
versities we know. Even the social
life is somewhat determined for us,
not only by restrictions of a heavy
work schedule but also by the
subtle power of ambition to be
like those around us. Being con-
fined to a locality which was once
aptly called, “A glass of stag-
nant water,” has its definite draw-
backs.

Reactions against the pressures
are oftentimes so futile and so
little recognized by ourselves that
we fall easily under the accusation
of immaturity and thoughtlessness.
Thus failing to understand our mo-
tivations, we tend to fall back on
the simplest explanation. We fol-
low in paths of action which we
can neither understand nor from
which we can long deviate.

It is here that the root of the re-
bellion lies. It is through the rude-

ness, the apparent irreligisity, the
blatant throwing aside of | David-
sonian ideals which occur in chapel
that we express a frustration with
the Davidson system that will not
frequently show itself in an in-
dividual way.

In the mass, as an individualless
group, in chapel, the necessity of
responsibility for personal action
disappears. Who hasn't felt the
loss of self in a crowd? When there
seems to be no need for account-
ing for individual action, (when by
analysis you are but one of 825)
and the powers of personal desires,
likes, and dislikes are to a great
degree being thrust on you by the
group, then there is little wonder
that we have the perfect situation
for a protest that we have.

There is only one last point
that needs to be added to this
discussion of the Davidson student
in chapel. It is that the protest is
heightened by the constant
struggle for marks, for passing
work, for that Phi Bete key, that
we carry on against—whom?

The professors are the targets.
Not that we dislike them all as
individuals. But when one of them
stands before us to lead the devo-
tional or give a talk, we are the
proletariat rising against the bour-
geoise all over again. The in-
evitable revolt of the ruled (the
students) against the rulers (the
professors) expresses itself each
time that we show them our ire—
our chapel conduct.

“No Spaghetti For Me,”
Says Italy’s Bruno Eynard

During the coming weeks Da-
vidson students are going to see
quite a lot of a dark Latin named
Bruno Eynard. A Fulbright Scho-

lar, this olive-skinned young man

of Rome has come to the campus
under the joint sponsorship of the

college and Pi Kappa Phi fraterni-

ty. Already the possessor of an
AB degree, he will study English,

‘constitutional law, and American
history before returning to the

University of Rome for his doc-

torate in law.

Of particular interest to resi-

dents of this vicinity is the fact
that Bruno is a member of the
Waldensian Church, an organiza-
tion which has added a unique
flavor to the historic tradition of
North Carolina.
sect, the Waldensians take their
name from Pierre Waldo, a mer-
chant of Lyons,
leadership they were founded in
Southern France during the twelfth
century. Upon becoming a part of
the Reformation movement, they
were severely persecuted and under
violent waves of the Counter Re-
formation, many were forced to
flee their homes and seek refuge
in the comparative security of the
New World. One such group of
emigrants made their homes in
the western part of this state,
establishing the town of Valdese,
known today for its French bread
and colorful inhabitants, many of
whom still hold to their mother

It was largely due to his being

Seminary in Rome, was in this

‘| country some months past to teach

at Columbia Theological Seminary,
where he met Dr. G. B. Watts, pro-
fessor of French at Davidson. The
latter, gathering material for a
book about the Waldensians, sold
him on the idea of Bruno’s com-
ing to Davids.n for a year of
American environment, after the
example of his brother, who is a
ministerial student in Pittsburgh.

Since his arrival on the campus,
Eynard has shrewdly observed that
the impressions he may gain from
his stay at Davidson will not neces-
sarily reflect typieal American life,
but only a small scene from the
panorama of our country. He is
equally anxious, too, that Ameri-
cans not judge his country solely
on the basis of the few Italians
that they encounter, himself in-
cluded. He thinks that the majority
of Americans invariably associate
Italy with the lazy, illiterate spa-
ghetti-eating inhabitants of the
southern part of his country, and
fail to consider the large middle
class population, with which his
family may be identified. As a

well educated, liberal, bourgeois
Italian, Eynard is justly proud of
his people's achievements and re-
grets the tab that has been placed
on Italy by most American tourists.
And as for spaghetti—he never
has liked the stuff.

The Davidson student finds in
Bruno Eynard a very polite, mild-
mannered individual—one who is,
however, quite willing to share
with his new friends his boyhood
experiences under the Fascist rule
of Mussolini, his recollections of
war days and the liberation, and
the customs and habits of his peo-
ple, as well as their way of think-
ing. He appears to be quite frank
in voicing his opinions of his host
country, but avoids making any
remark which may offend anyone.
One senses this immediately in
talking with him about the pro-
posal to send an American ambas-
sador to the Vatican, or more re-
cently, the appointment of Clare
Booth Luce, a Roman Catholic, as
our representative in Rome. While
candidly expressing the views of
the Italian citizen on these sub-
jects, he wants it clearly under-
stood that he is no political or
religious agitator.

But in a country where the Ro-
man Catholic Church has not con-
fined itself to religion, but has al-
ways exerted a vast political pow-
er, no person might be expected
to be more biased than the Wal-
densian in this matter. After seven
hundred years of constant Vatican
oppression, the inhabitants of the
little Waldensian Valley of north-
ern Htaly are still vigorous in their
struggle for personal liberty, and
neither Fascist nor Catholic has
ever been able to break their spirit.

Bruno, after a lengthy conversa-
tion about this subject, remarked
that the Roman Catholic Church
was most loud in its cry for free-
dom in those Communist areas
where her priests were restricted
and her work repressed, but where
she herself sat at the helm of
power, she offered freedom to none
of her rivals. “Where the popula-
tion is 26 per eg Cato" said
the dark-eyed ard cautiously,
“the Church is like a sheep. Where
it is 45 per cent, it is like a bark-
ing dog. Where it is 75 per cent,
it is like a wolf. No, No,” he cor-
rected himself hastily, “not a
wolf,” and then after some reflec-
tion, “yes,” he added, “like a wolf.”

Conference Split Looks Good
To George Washington Scribe

(Ed. Note: The following
article is reprinted from the
George Washington Hatchet.)

In a wholly unsurprising and
completely necessary move, the
Southern Conference gave birth to
the Atlantic Coast Conference.
Unlike most nativities, the off-
spring in this case is much stronger
than the parent. All of this is just
another way of saying that the
seven “big schools of the South-
ern Conference broke away and
formed a new league.”

The names of the schools in the
ACC are as well known to the
sports fan as the names of lob-
byists are known to Congressmen.
For the record the Atlantic Coast
Conference is composed of Duke,
Wake Forest, South Carolina,
North Carolina State, North Caro-
lina, Clemson and that brick giant
out at College Park. Rumors have
it that the ACC whegls are work-
ing on both Virginia and Ken-
tucky to join.

Unlike many reporters we are
not angry at the “Big Seven’s”
decision to form their own confer-
ence. In fact, we applaud the
move. Both the new league and
the old SC will be benefitted great-
ly. It will put more meaning into
league standings and group cham-
pionships.

Let us look a bit closer at the
SC as it stands today. The mem-
bers include West Virginia, Wil-
liam & Mary, Virginia Tech, Vir-
ginia Military, Furman, Davidson,
Washington & Lee, The Citadel,
Richmond, and of course, the Uni- —
versity. Many experts have taken
to call the SC “The Weak Sisters’
League.” It is true that the “Big
Seven” played present SC teams
ten times on the gridiron, and the
AAC clubs won seven. The three
SC wins were chalked up by the
Buff and Blue over NC _ State,
W&M over the same team, and
West Virginia over South Caro-
lina. They may call the SC the
“Weak Sisters” because of its grid
prowess, but the leadership is not
weak,

The 1953 SC is made up of
schools that have chosen “the
middie of the road” approach to
intercollegiate athletics. Their
leaders have decided to follow o
sane and sensible path, free of ex-
tremes. The new Southern Confer-
ence. does not suffer from the
blind and ruthless ambition of a
Maryland, nor does it fall victim
to the University of Chicago's
thinking. Chicago, you may re-
member, was once a leader in the
Big Ten, and then, about 1940, the
