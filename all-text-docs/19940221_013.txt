Shoney's, Chat 'n Chew compete for B&E's old business

By. Jeff Kent

Several months after the clos-
ing of favorite late-night diner and
Cornelius landmark, Bacon and
Eggs, two new restaurants have
emerged to fill the void. Shoney’s
in Cornelius and Chat ‘n Chew in
Mooresville recently opened their
doors to the public, offering a vari-
ety of menu items and various spe-
cials to lure in the old B&E regu-
lars. :

These two establishments of-
fer completely different atmo-
spheres and different styles of cook-
ing, but both are worth a visit.
Davidson students’ opinions con-
cerning the new breakfast stops
varied, but the one common com-
plaint concerns the lack of 24-hour
service. Both restaurants close at
11 p.m. on weekdays: Shoney’s
extends its hours to 1 a.m. Fridays
and Saturdays. Despite the ex-
tended hours, the essential 2-5 a.m.
feeding period required by college
students is not covered, leaving
many worried about hunger pains.

For those who do not mind the
early closing hours, the new res-
taurants offer a variety of specials
attractive to college students with
tight purses. Shoney’s, located
adjacent to the Holiday Inn in Cor-
nelius, sets out an "all you can eat"
breakfast buffet every morning for
either $4.99 or $5.99. The buffet is
open from 6 a.m. until 11 a.m.
weekdays and until 2p.m.on week-
ends, ‘

Davidson students who care
to get up during those hours have
found the buffet a great deal. One
Davidson student, notorious for
finicky eating habits, found the
breakfast buffet a pleasant surprise.
The student described the assort-
ment of foodsas “tasty, witha little
something for everyone.”

In addition to the morning
buffet, Shoney’s offers a regular
menu which includes such Ameri-
can staples as burgers, chicken
entrees and french fries. Overall,
Shoney’s received fairly positive
comments from students. How-

ever, a great deal of concern was
expressed over the lack of the tra-
ditional Shoney’s “Big Boy” in the
store front. Customers found eat-
ing without the familiar shadow of
the pudgy Shoney’s boy a little
disturbing but not a matter of para-
mount importance.

Always spend a buck on a jukebox

With our beloved B&E ban-
ished from Cornelius and doomed
to live only in our hearts and
memories, we were left hopelessly
deprived of wholesome, satisfy-

' ing, and cheap food. Undaunted,
we tightened our belts and turned
north, toward the only consola-
tion we could find: the Waffle
House. Though it does not have
movable tables, biscuits and gravy,

Still
Whistlin'
Dixie -_
with Geoff Graham
or the unprecedented Beltbuster
Breakfast, Waffle House has be-
come, over the year, our new late-
night home.

What made the transition pos-
sible, however, was not the won-
drous waffles, the motherly wait-
resses (though I love them dearly),
or the addition of “topped with
chili” to the list of hashbrown op-
tions. It was the jukebox.

I live my life according to
only three rules. First, always lis-

ten toa Hal Ketchum album before
buying it. Second, always order
the pecan pie if it’s available. And
third, always, always spendat least
a buck on the jukebox.

So far, these rules have served
me well—I own just one bad Hal
Ketchum album (I used to live by
only two rules); I’ve never had a
horrible dessert; and I’ve never,
ever left a Waffle House in a bad
mood.

Simply put, jukeboxes inspire
us. How many country (my editors
recently told me they’ve been
uncapitalizing “country” in my ar-
ticles. If they continue to do so,
please write in and protest) songs
use them as the vehicle to create a
profound metaphysical concept?
“If Hell had a Jukebox,” “Don’t
Rock the Jukebox,” “In the Corner
of My Mind Stands a Jukebox”—
the list goes on and on. There are
probably asmany songs about juke-
boxes as there are about Mamma.
Lord help us.

What is it about the music.

machines that inspire us so? Is it
the eclectic mix? Isit the nostalgic
connotations? Is it the six for a
dollar feature? Your guess is as

good as mine. The only jukebox
related mysteries I’ve unraveled
have to do with waitresses.

First, despite popular belief,
most Waffle House waitresses do
not like any. of the dozen or so
Waffle House songs always present
ona Waffle House jukebox. That’s
a myth.

Further, and more important,
your service, food, and relation-
ship with your waitress improves
substantially if you make it a point
to do one simple thing: before or-
dering, ask your waitress if there’s
a song she wants to hear (she’ll
probably respond with just a num-
ber). It’ll make her day (or night).
Keepin mind that, though you may
hate the song, you’re making some-
one happy.

Next time you're at the Waffle
House in Mooresville, slip in a few
quarters. It’ll do wonders for your
disposition. If you’re there Satur-
day or Sunday morning (or early
afternoon), play George Jones’
“She Stopped Loving Me Today”
(#186) and tell Michelle it’s for
her. She loves that song and as
long as she owns my heart, the
least I can do is make her smile.

For those that prefer more tra-
ditional Southern cooking, Chat ‘n
Chew opened for business about a
month ago on Broad Street in
Mooresville. Although Chat ‘n
Chew requires a longer drive, die-
hard B&E fans will find the menu
appealing. Former Baconand Eggs
employee, Chat ‘n Chew manager

Dottie Kail explains that their menu
was modeled after the food served
at B&E. She states their motto: “If
you miss the cookin’ at B&E, come
on down and see the folks at Chat
‘n Chew.”

Another attempt to attract
Davidson students includes aroom
which the manager designed spe-
cifically for college students. The
room contains pinball machines,
video games, a jukebox and large
tables for big groups.

Chat ‘n Chew’s weekly spe-
cials include spaghetti on Sunday
nights, liver and onions on Mon-
day, the po’ man’s special on Tues-
day (you will have to visit to find
out) and an open-face special on
Wednesdays.

Pricewise, Chat ‘n Chew is
comparable to its predecessor,
B&E, with items ranging from
about $1.50 to $4.50.

Chat ‘n Chew portrays a more
rural, laid back atmosphere than its
big, corporate counterpart,
Shoney’s, but is frequented a simi-
lar clientele.
