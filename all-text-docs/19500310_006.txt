of the individual, and thus to a cer-
tain éxtent also because of the
free society in existence, it is very
difficult to detect any clear changes
in the Russian setup, and we must
rely more or less on speculations
that can only be supported poorly.

In general, however, it may be
said, that there are to be found
definite changes in both society
setups involved, which in turn give
us more proof that the hypotheses
of another collision is not entirely
unsupportable.

Up to now, following human his-
tory, we find that most collisions
between extremes took places in

forms of war. This might lead to

the idea that war is the only suf-
ficient way to be found, and it is
also widely said that war, as long
as different ideas exist, will be in-
evitable. To contradict this con-
cept of war would in the eyes of
many people mean to show an al-
most dangerous optimism or to be
unable to face the facts existing.

It is clear, that war ap to now
was used to perform a_ certain
function. It was taken as a means
to settle vital differences between
nations or to solve problems con-
cerning the relation and the stand-
ing of nations to each other. Many
people say that its primary origin
is to be found within human char.
acter, which strives for competi-
tion and tries te impose certain
ideas on others. The same char-
acteristics could be found within

-a nation, As long as human na-

ture would not change, therefore
no changes in the existence and
of war could be

First, it may be answered, that
war never has been able to settle
any vital differences, as long as
they were not questions of merc
power. In the contrary it has only
been the cause of another war.

In my opinion we are facing the
tremendous task to find a substi-
tute for war, a substitute which
might be even more efficient than
war. It must be something that
performs the settling function of
war, without using or adding its-
estructive function, War in the
sense of competition and the effort

always exist, but it is. not neces.

formed in the way they were per-
formed up to now, and which dif-
fers from the animal like destruc-
tion only in one aspect, their great-
er efficiency.

Where this, probably very real,
substitute may be found is a4 ques.
tion I am unable to answer. Man
has been searching for it; in re-
ligion, in parliament and in the
roundtable conference. He has tried
to avoid war during recent times,
but this more because of fear of
the terrifying weapons, that will
be used and that are beyond his
control, than because of his under-
standing of war to be unethical and
below human nature.

It might be that our religion
provides an answer as to where to
find this substitute. Maybe a new
philosophy will give it to us. It is
beyond my capacity even to elimi-
nate the sources, which the answer
may be found. But it is my strong
belief in a divine law in human
history and in a great meaning and
reason within the existence of the
human race, that makes me hope
that this substitute may be found
before it is too late. It must be
found, because future wars would
mean destruction, and destruction
can possibly be the end of human
history,

two guides for a general college
music course: first, that students
enrolled in the course have some
taste for music; and second, that
the purpose of the course be to
help students increase their enjoy-

literary societies. Some of these
are: The North Carolina Philoso-
