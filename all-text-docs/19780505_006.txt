The Davidsonian

May o, 1978

Davidson students jailed in protest

(Continued from page 1)

formed a large circle in the
center of the camp to join in
singing followed by a few
minutes of silence before the
final trek began.

Reporters and photographers
were out in full strength. As
demonstators passed through
the camp gate they received
hugs and handshakes from sup-
porters and were photographed
by newsmen.

The feelings of the marchers
were a combination of determi-
natio, excitement, and uncer-
tainty as to what exactly was
going to happen. Some of the
marchers walked in silence with
their thoughts, some sang and
cheered, while others picked up
trash along the road.

Each affinity group had
“support people’’ who stayed
off of AGNS property. These
people provided moral support
to the other protestors and were
instrumental in keeping up the
spirit of the group.

Support people from David-
son were Roger Brown, the
organizer of the Davidson affi-
nity group, Katherine Allen,
Dave Keller, and Anne Stan-
back. @

The 285 people crossed the
line. Among them were David-
son students Beth DuBose,
Alicia Brown, Albert Connette,
Chuck Gaddy, Steve Holman,
Geoff Little, Brad Kerr, Jeanie
McIntyre, Emily Partin, Mike
Sorrentino, Susan Wilson, and
Lindy Wood.

Joining hands, the other pro-
testers made their way past
policemen and cameramen and
crossed the boundary line onto
AGNS property, thereby com-
mitting an act of civil disobedi-
ence.

For the next two hours the
police took no aetion except for
reqesting the protesters to
leave.

Each affinity group chose a
respresentative to make a short
speech to those present explain-

ing the group’s reason for
participation in the protest.

Kach spokesman expressed his

concerns about nuclear power.

The protestors milled about
the area singing songs to the
support people and the state
patrolmen. The demonstrators
made it clear that the policemen
were not the objects of ‘the
protest but rather it was AGNS
with which they ,were con-
cerned. At one point the police
were given a standing ovation
by the protestors,

Approximately 3:00 that af-
ternoon AGNS gave the go-
ahead for the arrest to begin.

Representatives from the
State Attorney General's office
were present, and everything
was done according to precise
legal specificagions..

Each demonstrator was ap-
proached individually by a rep-
resentative of AGNS, who read
a short statement requesting

_ that the individual leave the

premises. When the person
refused, he was then addressed
by a member of the South

‘Carolina Law Enforcement Di-

vision who read a short state-
ment advising that if the indivi-
dual did not leave the premises,
he would be placed under arrest.

Each of the protestors re-
fused to leave, and was arrested
for trespassing.

We knew what was going to
happen, said DuBose, but she
said it was a shock when they
heard the officer actually say,
“You're under arrest...”

Once arrested, each person
left peacefully with the police-
man. No one went ‘‘limp’’ in
order to resist arrest. There was
no malice or violence; the entire
process was carried out in a
spirit of cooperation. In this
respect, the protest was quite
different from the violent pro-
tests reminiscent of the ’60s.

Each protestor ‘was accom-
panied by a policeman to an
area designated for picture tak-
ing and fingerprinting.

After the actual arrest. and
preliminary booking, protestors
were put on seperate buses,
await
transport to the Barnwell Coun-
ty Jail.

At one point, the women
began singing. Their songs were

directed to several men who had
just been arrested and were
waiting outside to be loaded on
a bus,

McIntyre said, ‘Though we
were physically seperated by
the walls of the bus, there was a
feeling of caring for each other
relected by the songs. That was
the most emotional thime of the
whole experience for me."’

The next several hours were
perhaps the most tedious and
tiring. After being fed an *
tutional meal,”’ the protestors
waited aboard the bus for
processing. Some felt tense
awaiting the decision on the
amount at which bond would be
set.

According to Gaddy, ‘‘Aftér
having waited captive on the
prison buses several hours,
word finally reached us that our
tactic of bond solidarity had
succeeded; that the local au-
thorities had relented and re-
duced bond to $15.

“This latest victory, filled us
with such exhilaration that we
cheered and banged on the
metal ceiling of the bus for some
minutes, being joined in this
gaiety by blacks who came from
the town and stood outside the
prison fences to support our
challenge of the establishment.

“After the gist of our noise-
making expired, a fellow protes-
tor stood up from his seat and
secured our silence and atten-
tion by delivering a most mov-
ing and articulate speech.. He
asked that we recognize the
leniency we had encountered
and to reflect a little on the
suffering and injustices inflicted
on those who had preceded us in
other struggles.

“He then elaborated on the
plight of so many Americans
who all their lives are oppressed
because of their powerlessness
in the system

“The eoniimente he expres-
sed were so very sober, that |
barely succeeded in holding
back my tears, and the bowed
heads and the silence which

insti-

endured for several moments
after the address had been
finished demonstrated that this
reaction was shared by all.’

Ten at a time the demonstra-
tors were escorted into the
detention center. There they
were again frisked, and then
taken to another room to fill out
information forms and have
mug shots and fingerprints
taken

All were impressed by the
courteous and friendly attitude
of the law enforcement officers.
The process was slow but some
one noted, *‘They’d probably
never had to arrest 285 people in
Barnwell at one time.”

After another long wait, each
protestor was escorted by _ his
arresting officer before the ma-
gistrate. The protestors all
pleaded “not guilty.”’

All the Davidson students
decided to post bond and after
paying $15 they were released.
About 30 people, however, re-
fused to post bond and are at
this time in jail awaiting trial.

Upon release, the protestors

‘were greeted outside the fence

by the support people. They
were driven back to the camp-

site by the Harmony Squad,
members of the Palmetto Alli-
ance. :

Wilson said, ‘The police were
somewhat restricted in their
ability to express their feelings
in that they were on duty and
had to remain non-partisan.
When we arrived back at the
campsite, getting hugged by
the people you'd gotten close to
in the past couple days was a
positive feeling after the uncer-
tain atmosphere of the day's
events.”

Steve Holman was the last
protestor to be processed. He
finally arrived back at the
campsite around 2:30 a.m. The
drive home was long miserable
but the group finally pulled in
about 7 a.m. Tuesday morning.
Exhausted but happy and in-

spired by their experience.
Brown, who witnessed the

protest as a support person,
emphasized the fact that the
protest remained non-violent
and non-destructive. He felt it
was a success though it was at
times sensationalized by signs
that made it appear that
AGNS’ goal was intentional
destruction of human life.
Most of the group believe
that the main purpose of the
march and civil disobedience
protest was to gain greater
public awareness. According to
Partin, ‘‘if the public sees that
1300 people joined in a march

and 285 were willing to be
arrested to protest nuclear po-
wer, then maybe people wil]
realize that nuclear power is not
something to be accepted light-
ly. It demands our careful
consideration.”

Alice Brown said, “I know
that the demonstration was
worthwhile because since we've
been back many people have
expressed interest in the issue
and have said that they want to
know more about it so they can
make a decision.”’

“It was both an emotional,
rational experience and while its
effect is yet to be seen it was a
worthwhile, valuable learning
experience,’’ said Dubose.

‘‘I was impressed by the
organization and commitment
of the people there,”’ said Little.
Little was not overly optimistic
about the effectiveness of the
protest, but is looking forward
to ‘Barnwell II.”

“We were fortunate that the
press coverage was either neu-
tral or positive and quite wide-
spread instead of the sparse
negative response that protests
usually receive,’’ said Kerr.

‘‘Many people futiley fight
for the issues they believe in
and are reconciled only by the
knowledge that they are doing
what they can. We were fortu-
nate enough to actually get
positive results for our efforts.”

police widen role

(Continued from page 1)

Hughes has hired two new
officers. Both are certified med-
ical technicians. Of the officers
who worked on campus before
the change, only one decided to
leave the college and go work
for the town. All of the employ-
ees who remained are trained in
first aid.

According to Hughes, the
emphasis has been taken away
from their role as policemen.
They have been given wider
responsibilities, dealing with
many aspects of student wel-
fare,

“We're more involved. Before
we just had a precinct. Now
we've got a department of
public safety," said Hughes.

He said that he’s been assign-
ed to survey campus buildings
to find out how to make them
accessible to the handicapped.

“This has really been a good
change-over for the officers.
They're getting some good be-
nefits they didn’t have before,”’
he said.

Now that the police are paid
directly by the college, they are
eligible for hospitilization and
pension benefits.

The only criticism Hughes
offered of the new system is
that the town council has
restricted their arrest power to
the campus itself. They have no
jurisdiction over college-owned
off-campus ‘housing.

Also, he would like to hire an
additional officer to spread out
the workload.

Brown said that he would like
to see the Davidson force break
its final tie with the town force

by getting their own dispatch
service.

About the only person who
seems to be disappointed by the
new system is Davidson mayor
Tom Sadler. ‘‘I would have
much preferred that it (the
community police force) contin-
ue as one,’ he said. “It’s a
matter of safety in numbers.’

As for the Infirmary, Dean
Terry described the improve-
ment in student health care as
being almost “miraculous.”

He attributes this mostly to
the work done by the seven
doctors from Charlotte Memor-
ial Hospital who have manned
the Infirmary this year. In
describing their work, he used
the adjectives ‘‘concerned,’’
“dedicated,”” and ‘‘dependab-
le.”

Terry said that they ‘‘stay on
(at the Infirmary) as long as
they are needed.’’ Whenever
they have gotten worried about
a student patient who was
depressed, they have taken the
time to tell him and the counsel-
ors about it, Terry said.

Infirmary Director Dorothy
Sherrill was out of town and
unavailable for comment, but
one of the nurses said that she
personally hasn’t heard any
student complaints.

“There’ve been no complaints
over here. We haven't even
made The Davidsonian,’’ she
added, declining to have her
name in print.

Even the SGA has experienc-
‘ed a paucity of infirmary com-
plaints. Brown said that he
hasn't received a single one

ince being elected.
