COX ON FACULTY

Great Influence on Morals of
Country Result of Work of
the College

The only distinctive piece of foreign |
work which the Davidson student body
as a whole carries on is furnishing an-
nually the support of Warren Cox, of
the class of ’23. Cox is Professor of
Chemistry in’ Hangchow Christian Col-
lege, Hangchow, China. Reports from
the president of that college, Dr. Fitch,
who is now in the U. S., assure David-
somians of the fact that Cox is carry-
ing to Hanchow College the real David-
son Wildcat spirit. The following infor-
mation concerning Hangchow College
will be of interest to all Davidsonians:

Hangchow College is chartered by the
District of Columbia under a board of
trustees representing equally the foreign
mission boards of the two gredt Presby-
terian churches of the United States. It
furnishes a regular arts course, major-
ing in education.

The college is located in the suburbs
of Hangchow, the capital of the province
of Chekiang, a province wth a popula-
tion equal to about one-fifth of the pop-
ulation of the United States. The city
of Hangchow is the most famous in all
China for its beauty of location. It has
also been a center of education and of
art.

About two hundred men have come
from this institution as full college grad-
uates, of whom about sixty have gone
into the ministry, about seventy-five into
business, about thirty-five into the Y. M.
C. A. and other religious organizations
as secretaries, and the remainder have
become engineers,
workers, ete.

physicians, literary

At present there is a student body of
two hundred and fifty-six young men, a
foreign staff of sixteen and a Chinese
staff of about twenty men.

An educational commission which re-
cently went to China, and which repre-
sented various mission boards, made a
careful survey of the entire educational
situation and recommended that Hang-
chow College be enlarged so as to have
a teaching and administrative staff of
twenty-four foreigners and thirty-nine
Chinese, with a student body of five hun- |
dred. This result would secure maximum
efficiency as regards pedagogical work,
economy of administration and the high- ,
est results as regards the development of
personality and Christian leadership.

Last year the Davidson student body!
pledged over a thousand dollars for this
great work. About $250.00 of this has
not been paid. Warren Cox’s letter in|
this issue of The Davidsonian indicates
just what the student body is doing,
showing what $2.00 a man can do.

MANAGERS OF TRACK BUILD)
GOOD SURFACE

Due to the earnest efforts of Jim Pat-!
ton and his cohorts, the track is now in
the best condition that it has been so!
far this year. Everyone who witnessed |
the track meet, held on last Friday, could
readily see that the track managers have
not been loafing on the job and if David-
son does not put out the best track team
in the state, it will not be because the
track is not in, good condition.

Manager Jim Patton says that the
track is in as good condition as could
be expected but that in a few days he
expects to have the whole thing disced |
and rolled. There have been several bad
places in the track that have been very
difficult to patch up and put in good
shape but by a great deal of work on the |
part of the manager and assistant man-
agers, it has been put in pretty good ;
shape. The entire track will not be
worked over again however until after |
the High School meet, which Coach Til- |
sez is counting on staging very soon.

Over at Wake Forest they have such an|
abundance of pitchers that Stamey says he |

‘Success Assured
By Landscaping

Other thoughts than mere thoughts of
love are indulged in when the season of
Spring Fever strikes upon the world in
and around Davidson. With a longing
for a real background in which the Junior
Speaking and week-end parties can be
made successful, the authorities come

|forth with plans for sufficient landscape
| gardening to clothe the campus in a soft
land yielding carpet of green.

Steps are
taken whereby further limited anti-
Freshman territory may be set aside and
into a haven for upper-
classmen footsteps ready to yield to the
number elevens of small and large men
of thé three upper classes.

As a medium toward the attainment of
this end, the first of last week saw sev-
eral bags—yellow bags—demurely repos-
ing in sublime content over the canopy
of grass spread across the Hill. These
bags, harmless in themselves, would not
allow the approach of anyone unfamiliar
with them or their odors. Concentrated
fertilizers reposed throughout the cam-
pus in one hundred pound quantities.

Discontent with the position in such a
small area covered with the plant’s
nourishment, several were the men in
overalls who donned huge baskets to
play joyfully in the oppressive fish and
bone meal. Having donned the accoutre-
ments to their play, these men proceeded
in a manner unforseen, except for the
past forty years, on the Davidson cam-
pus. With first one hand and then the

_other, even as the sower sows his seed,

did the guano scatterers proceed to dis-
tribute the nitrates over the soil in an
even and uniform colored layer of dust-
like cover,

As a result of the diligence shown in
the play, the grass has now begun to
feel the effects of the sustenance gained
from such

sublime essence of concen-
trated plant foods. So extensive has
been the landscape gardening on the

campus proper that the blades of the
bermuda have at least attained one more
sixtenth of an inch in Ingth and one
more shade deeper in color,

But, in their wise discretion, the au-
thorities did not stop with beautifying
Behind the sustain-
ing wall lining the East sid of Main
Street real landscaping has been taking
There a plow,.a harrow and more
sowers have been employed. Grass seed
now offer a perfect. feasting place for
sparrows, wrens, and other types of the
feathered kind. The borders of the cam-

|pus will soon take on their first coat of

verdancy.

Steps have been taken to prevent the
crop of grass which will surely result from
such an outlay of labor from escaping,

‘once it reaches anything like mature age.

Suspended on posts three feet high and
running around the plots so recently cul-
tivated is a fence. A wire, forceful and
restraining, has been placed there to pre-
vent the sole of many a shoe from beat-
ing the bovine to the nest of green fod-
der. Such an addition is surely an ad-
junct to the campus, increasing its beauty
and demanding, in the future, an increas-
ed respect for anything like physical im-
provements on outside conditions as they
now appear around the Davidsonian
hangouts.

Statesville Receives
Davidson Deputation

Several Students Make Visit to
Nearby City for Boys’ Con-
ference

|

A deputation composed of a number
of Davidson students went to Statesville
last week to assist in the boys’ work.
This deputation was similar to others
sent out recently under the direction of
Mr. Leonard, the state Y. M. C. A.
boys’ secretary for this district.

Those who took part in the work Fri-
day were L. L. Deck, A. N. Moffett, S. 3.
Bryant and Clanton Williams. Talks
were made to the high school students
by Bryant and Williams, while Deck and
Moffett spoke to the boys in the lower
grads and/also made a talk in one of the
negro schools.

The main feature of Saturday’s pro-
gram was a hike in which about seventy
of the Statesville boys took part. Among
other events there were several baseball
games and a weiner roast.

The meeting*Sunday afternoon brought
the work to a close. At that time Harry
Price spoke to a large group of boys
on the living of a clean, Christian life.
The Davidson quartet, composed of
Piggy Martin, Tom Barr, Lowrance and
Malcolm Lockhart furnished music for}
the meeting.

DEATH TAKES JACK MILLER

and it was thought that if he could get home |
that soon he would improve and be able to}
resume his duties in the classroom, |

Martin Teague, who is also from Laurens, |
had planned to make the trip with Jack, but
when Jack learned that he was going home
he brightened up to the extent that the au-
thorities and Jack thought he could make the
trip alone, and this he did. As soon as he
reached home he was examined by Dr. J. 11
Teague, and the latter, knowing that he had
previously suffered from kidney trouble,
recognized the cause of his illness immedi-
ately, and after Jack’s death stated that had
he remained at Davidson he would not have
recovered, He lived only 48 hours after he
reached home. He was conscious until the
last, and was cognizant of his serious con-
dition.

The funeral was held at 4:30 o'clock Sat-
urday afternoon from the home of his pa-
rents ,the funeral service being conducted by
his former pastor, who returned to Laurens
to officiate at the funeral, and he was assist-
ed by the present pastor of the Presbyterian
Church and the pastor of the Methodist
Church there. The pall-bearers were seven
of his friends in Laurens, and Wade H. Alli-
son, his roommate at Davidson, who went to

their esteem for Jack by sending a similar
token. Other expressions of sympathy were |
received by the family from friends of Jack

Valley Waters, by Charles D. Stewart.

“The story itself is an arresting one,
concerning the search for the home and
‘mother of a shell-shocked American sol-
}dier who has come back to life as it
were with his memory a blank.

“The scene is laid principally in Ohio,
in and around the Muskingum Valley.”
The Green Mirror, by Hugh Walpole.
“The Green Mirror has not one touch
of aniline in all its warm colors, rich
presences and faithful portraiture. It
is a fine novel, grappling bravely with

the great ironies of mother-love.”

Stacey, by Alexander Black .

“For the great chance in life, Stacey
looks about him with high-spirited ex-
He is full of curiosities, full
theories. He has a lively sense of
romance but a intention to be
practical. Consigned to the parlor floor

liness can be partners. Back home means
the Middle West. The job and the dis-
tractions mean New York.

“In the basement he finds the drama
of the girl who has turned from the
streets and the man—a stalwart sinner--
who has put the width of the continent
between him and the scene of his fall.
Above stairs he meets the girl who makes
his bed, and more audacious femininity
Outside, in
the painted world, he finds one job after
another; as a promoter of business in a
hair-restorer enterprise; as a handyman
in a rich woman's household; and then
comes his ironic final plunge—the toss
of the dice for success, that closes Mr.

to whose wiles he succumbs.
