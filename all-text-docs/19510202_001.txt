ATO INSTALLATION FESRUARY 23, 24, 25

Local ATO Group
Receives Notice
Of Acceptance

After many months of preparation, the announcement was
received Saturday by the ATO Club of their acceptance as the
Epsilon Omega chapter of Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity. Plans

for the official installation are

now in the making and it will

occur on February 23rd, 24th, and 25th.

The club first entered its petition to Alpha Tau Omega on
March 27, 1950. On April 10, a delegation from the chapters of
Province Six arrived on the campus along with many national
officers for an inspection of the local fraternity. The official
charter as an ATO club was received on May 15 following the
unanimous approval of the represented chapters and the High

Council of the Fraternity.

‘On December 28, the petition was presented to the national
chapter through a brochure prepared by the club. The succes-
sful result of the voting was first made known in a telegram
received on January 27 from Steward Daniels, National Secre-
tary of the Fraternity, ‘‘It is a genyine pleasure to officially ad-
vise you chapters have approved your petition overwhelmingly.
Arrangements are being completed for your installation Feb-
ruary 23 and 24 at which time you will receive most cordial
welcome into our ATO family as North Carolina Epsilon Omega

Chapter.”’

Mr. Emest Amold

Leaves College For
Important Position

Appointment of Rev. Ernest J.
Arnold, who was assistant to the
president of Davidson college, to the
position of southeastern director of
the National Council of Churches of
Christ in the U. S. A., formed in
Cleveland, Ohio, was announced
last December.

Mr. Arnold left for Atlanta, Ga.
for his headquarters office Wed-
nesday where he will be actively
in charge of the Southeastern area
of the national council. He will be
concerned particularly with foreign
and home missions, religious educa-
tion and higher education, steward-
ship, and evangelism. In his new
office, Mr. Arnold, who already
possesses a record of many dis-
tinctive attainments in the field
of religious leadership, will have
exceptionally large responsibilities
and opportunities.

A graduate of Presbyterian Col-
lege, Clinton, S. C., Mr. Arnold
received a B.D. degree from Yale
University Divinity School. In 1939
he was ordained as a Presbyterian
minister in Granville Presbytery.
From 1939 to 1948 he was executive
secretary of the North Carolina
Council of Churches with offices
at Duke University. He became
assistant to the President of Da-
vidson College in 1948.

“It is with sincere regret,” Presi-
dent John R. Cunningham an-
nounced in chapel Wednesday,
“that we assent to Mr. Arnold’s
severance of his connection with
the college community. He ren-
dered a signal service, especially
during the period of the David-
son Development program. He and
his delightful family will be missed
by the entire community.”

Following Dr. Cunningham's
brief. remarks, Mr. Arnold was
applauded by the student
body Wednesday in chapel, in ap-
preciation for his past service to
Davidson.

Seagle Takes 195]
Chemistry Award

Lee M. uy gon of L. M.
Seagie, 1012 9th Avenue, Hickory,
N. C., received the 1951 department-
al award from the Davidson Col-
lege Chemistry Department for his
excellent scholastic record in in-
troductory Chemistry.

The award, an inscribed copy of
the “Handbook of Chemistry and
Physics” is given to the freshman
each year who.makes the highest
average in first year chemistry.

Other chemistry prizes include
the $250 D. H. Howard award for
the senior judged by the depart-
ment as the outstanding man in
the field, and the Gamma Sigma
Epsilon prize which goes to the
best junior chemist.

She: “You say you make up
these jokes yoursclf?”

He: “Yes, out of my head.”

She: “You must be.”

Major Charles W. Sample, assist-
ant pro’essor of Military Science
and Tactics, has been ordered to
a new assignment, in the personnel
section of the staff of Third Army
Headquarters in Atlanta. He plans
for Mrs. Sample and their two small
daughters to remain in Davidson
until he is settled, probably in
March.

Major Sample, a Davidson grad-
uate of the class of '39 arrived for
duty at the College in the summer
of 1949, His assignment was sche-
duled to be for a minimum of 3
years. However, the expanding
strength of the Army as a result of
the Korean situation has resulted
in this reassignment “of a number
of regular army officers to positions
associated with the expansion.

The reassignment of one of its
3 regular army officers was not
expected by the College. Orders
for Major Sample’s reassignment
came last week.

While at Davidson, Major Sam-
ple has proven an able popular
member of the faculty: always in-
terested in the ‘students and in their
instruction, and character. He has
also been very active in community
life, and in the work of the church.

Major Sample has been replaced
by Captain Charles M. Hull, a grad-
uate of Illinois College in 1940.
Captain Hull has done graduate
work at the University of Illinois.
He is a reserve officer and comes

‘to Davidson from Headquarters,

Third Army. Captain and Mrs. Hull,
and their 7-year-old daughter, are
residing with Professor and Mrs.
Erwin while awaiting a housing
vacancy.

Enrollment Figures
Show 8 P. Ct. Loss

Enrollment figures announced
Wednesday in chapel by Dr.
Cunningham show only an

8 percent decrease in students since
September, a figure which he said
was “approximately normal.”
School opened in September with
a total enrollment of 863; enroll-
ment for the present semester to-
tals 794. Dr. Cunningham said that
this decrease is “decidedly favor-
able” when compared with other
men’s colleges. Davidson officials,
however, are reluctant to predict
what the enrollment for next year
will be. Prospective students may
be heavily affected by the proposed
18-year-old draft and new regula-
tions will probably change the stat-
us of students now in college.

Miss Spence Serving
As Staff Librarian

Miss Laura W. Spence, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Earl H. Spence,

Davidson, has been assigned to the
Special Services Section, Head-
quarters Southwestern Command.

Formerly a staff librarian with
the Special Services Section, Head-
quarters Ist. Cavalry Division, Miss
Spence is now employed as a staff
librarian by the Department of

| the Army. She arrived in the Far

East in October 1946,

Ray Cunningham
Receives Award

At a meeting on Friday, January
26, the Davidson College Alumni
Chapter of Mecklenburg County
awarded to Ray Cunningham the
annual Mecklenburg Medal. This
award is presented each year to the
Davidson senior from Mecklenburg
County, judged most outstanding
in college activities. The medal was
presented by Ernest Hunter, 4 pre-
vious recipient of the same award.
Last year’s honored student was
Bo Roddey. A committee of five
students makes the selection of
the medalist.

The meeting was held at Myers
Park Presbyterian Church in Char-
lotte, where Dr. John McSween,
pastor of the Fourth Presbyterian
Church of Greenvile, South Caro-
lina, spoke to a group of two hun-
dred on the crisis facing today’s
Christian world. Further participa-
tion by Davidson students at the
meeting was of a musical nature,
furnished by the “Cripple Creek
Boys.”

Open Meeting on Gambling
Produces Varied Opinions

Around 30 students attended the
open. meeting of the Constitution
Committe of the Student Council
in Eu Halt Wednesday night to
discuss the issue of gambling at
Davidson. While nothing definite
was to be decided, the discussion
brought out several points for the
committee to consider in deciding
what gambling is and how it should
be punished,

Chairman Ken Goodpasture em-
phasized at the beginning that the
scope of the discussion should not
include gambling as a moral issue
in all life but only gambling in
relation to the Davidson Cofleg¢
campus.

There were three main bodies of
opinion on the subject of gambling.
Individualist Jim Murray stood for
repeal of the gambling law since
a Davidson student is old enough
to care for himself and can decide
for himself whether or not he will
gamble. Bill Brooks asserted that
Davidson is a Christian school and
must try to attain the Christian
ideal; that gambling was taking
something of value without working
for it; that any game where -“an
external device is used to determine
the winner” was gambling and
should be prohibited. Several boys
took positions in between, trying
to draw the line between organized
and unorganized gambling, and say-
ing that unorganized gambling,
whatever that is, should not be
against the rules.

Although a few people suggested

that specific forms of gambling
be enumerated in the constitution,
the main body of opinion felt that
a gencral definition of gambling
would provide fewer loopholes and
leave the student council more at
liberty to exercise its judgment in
each case,

As for punishment, it was gener-
ally thought. that if the student
council has the duty of defining
gambling, (which it now has, since
the constitution makes no attempt
to do so), it should also have the
right to impose whatever penalty
the seriousness of the offense justi-
fied (the penalty now is automatic
shipping). There should, however,
be upper and lower limits to the
penalty. t

These main conclusions, then,
were reached:

(1) There should be a law against
gambling at Davidson. —

(2) A more definite, but still not
a specific or detailed, definition of
gambling should be inserted in the
constitution.

(3) The Student Council should
have the power to define gambling,
(using a general definition in the
constitution as a guide), and to de.
cide the seriousness of the penalty
to be imposed.

(4) The Student Council mem-
bers should be given a better under-
standing of the nature of their duty
before accepting nomination for of-
fice.

As the reader can see, there are
many knotty problems yet to be

THE GREAT CROSSED CROSS PROVIDES MYSTERY

The crowd below was watching
breathlessly. The two mighty
cranes strained, slowly, ever so
slowly, hoisting the mass of metal
and gold leaf to-its perch 149 feet
above the ground. Gradually the
cone-shaped object came into con-
tact with the hands of waiting work-
men, then was lowered into place,
The spire of the new Davidson
College church was mounted!

The eight foot gold cross was
majestic up there in the sky. But
then, low and behold (or rather,
alas and alack!) it was noticed that
the cross was facing in the wrong
direction. Wasn't it supposed to
face north, the same direction that

the main entrance of the new
building faces? It was. But
now it was facing toward Main
Street, toward the West. Why so?

On that gloomy January 12 af.
ternoon, over two hundred specta-
tors saw a freakish mechanical mis-
calculation which has since become
a minor mystery to Davidson stu-
dents, alumnae, and townspeople.
Letters have been pouring in to
many of the officials of the Col-
lege inquiring if the cross is to be
left in its present position. Some-
one even wrote Dr. Cunningham,
while the president was in Florida,
to find out the answer to this ques-
tion.

The answer is no. College treasur-
er F. L. Jackson explains that the
cross could have been turned the
same day that the steeple was
erected. However, within the next
few days, it will definitely be turned.
The solution: About five minutes
work by two or three workmen. It
will be as simple as that.

Mr. Jackson, in explaining the
Great Mystery of the Wrong Way
Cross added that if work proceeds
according to schedule, the con-
struction of the new church should
be completed by Homecoming of
next year, and will be dedicated at

that time.

Bill Clark’s Men
Will Make Music
For Pan-Hel Set

Bill Klein announced this week that a series of mid-winter
dances, under the sponsorship of the Pan Hellenic Council, will
be given Friday and Saturday, February 16 and 17. These
dances will be held on the campus in the Johnston Memorial
Gymnasium. Ticket prices have yet to be decided upon, but

13 Initiates Taken
Into Phi Mu Alpha

In Secret Meeting

In an impressive ritual and sec-
ret initiation service held last Mon-
day night, 13 pledges were initiat-
ed into Phi Mu Alpha, national
honorary music fraternity. The new
members are Morgan Bailey, Dick
Barnwell, Bill Crymes, Jesse Fish-
er, Allan Garrison, John Gibbs,
Harold Gilliland, Dick Harris, Ra-
mon Hart, Harry Hickey, Raymond
Lynch, Pat McGeachy, and Ralph
Roberts.

The officers for this year are:
President, Alfred Neumann; Vice-
President, Roy Davis; Secretary,
Bil! Whitesides; Treasurer, Dave
Whitener; Historian, Henry. Han-
sen; Warden, Herb Russell.

The purpose of this fraternity. is
to further the cause of music on
the campus and in America. Last
semester it presented a performance
of “The Telephone,” a modern
opera, and sponsored record pro-
grams in the record listening room.
Projects for this semester include
the presentation of several soloists
in chapel, a possible radio broad-
cast -of recordings to the dormi-
tories, the annual Inter-Fraternity
Sing in April, and a bulletin board
in Chambers for musical events.

solved on the issue of gambling.
The constitution committee, com.
posed of Ken Goodpasture, Ray
Cunningham, and Larry Dagenhart,
will appreciate any assistance on
this matter from any source.

Klein thinks they will be around
five dollars. Bill Clarke and his or-
chestra will furnish music for the
three dances.

Beginning the trio will be a for-
mal dance on Friday night lasting
from nine until ono o'clock. Presi-
dent Klein and ‘the members of
the Pan Hellenic Council request
that students follow the custom of
not giving flowers to their dates.
Refreshments for the dance as well
as for the informal dance Satur-
day night will be sold in the base.
ment of the gym froma concession
stand.

On Saturday afternoon a_ tea
dance will be given from four until
five-thirty o'clock. It will be fol-
lowed that evening by an informal
dance which will last from cight
until twelve o'clock in the John-
ston Gym.

Bill Clarke and his orchestra will
travel from Atlanta, Georgia where
he entertains a full schedule of
playing dates throughout the year.
His ‘men have been richly applaud-
ed at many Atlanta clubs and ho-
tels. He has played consistently at
The Piedmont Driving Club, The
Biltmore Hotel and at the several
colleges in and around Atlanta such
as Georgia Tech, Emory, and the
University of Georgia. In addition
to these, he is a great favorite with
the numerous high school’-fraterni-
ties and sororities there. A friend
of Klein's, Clarke has promised to
play “only what the students want.”
Klein says “this doesn't include
novelty tunes.” ;

A patriotic note tinds its way into
the theme of these dances which
will be George Washington’s birth-
day. This will prompt an ample
number of bright red cherries,
hatchets, and red, white, and blue
streamers.

‘An additional event to the week
end’s entertainment list will come
in the form of a swimming meet
Saturday afternoon in the homé

|pool. Davidson's tank men will Vie

for top honors with a highly-touted

swim team from N. C. State. This |

will be the eighth, meet for the
‘Cats, who have splashed to. a 1-4
record so far in their present sea-
son.

In an effort .to avoid any possible
legal difficulties, the Pan-Hel
Council asks any student who plans
to have his date stay in Davidson
or vicinity refrain from paying for
her room. This is socially correct
and to do otherwise might forsee-

| sly lead to complications.

Pre-Ministerial Students
Receive 4D Classification

After a very careful study of
“Theological School Enrollments”
the National Headquaters of Se-
lective Service has authorized a
4D classification for anyone who is
under the care of Presbytery and is
pre-enroiled in a Theological Sem-
inary (Selective Service Regulation
Par. 1622.19). That means defer-
ment until completion of his theo-
logical training. This ordinarily ap-
plies to candidates now ‘in college;
but if the candidate is actually un-
der the care of Presbytery, he
might even pre-enroll in Seminary
while still in High School.

No one would want a student to
hide behind any provision in order
to avoid military service. The above
course, however, is one approved
by the Government itself in its over-
all manpower policy. It provides
for a ministerial candidate to com-

plete his chosen course of study
and be ready to serve where he
may feel he is most neéded at that
time—in the pastorate or chaplain-
cy.

Recognizing the need for educat-
ed men in every field, Selective
Service has provided that the in-
duction of any man now attending
college may be postponed until the
end of the present academic year.
Further deferment may be made
possible after this scholastic year.
If so, it will be based upon the cur.
rent year’s scholastic standing. All
R.O.T.C. students . are deferred.
Students in Seminary or in college
and under the care of Presbytery,
and who hold commissions in the
line,—if called to active duty,
should ask immediately for a six
months’ delay. Such request, if
granted, can be renewed.
