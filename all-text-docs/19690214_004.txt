| Summer School Curriculum

By JOE SMITH
Staff Writer

Whit Morrow and Joe Kil
patrick are organizing a
summer high. scHool pro.
gram for Davidson that
would aid the _ intellectual
and social development of
talented students from un-
derprivileged backgrounds.

Morrow said that the idea
for the program is a result
of an internship at Yale
Summer High. School which
he obtained last summer
through the Richardson Fel.
lows Program.

He went on to point out
that this program brought
150 students from all parts
of the country to the Yale
campus in an effort to stimu.
late an interest in learning
and to aid their personal
growth.

“Although we are basing
our program on the one at
Yale." continued Morrow,
‘we plan to adapt it to the
situation at Davidson, which
will make it somewhat dif-
ferent. We haven't made any
final plans about the pro
gram yet.”

Kilpatrick said that the
rationale for the creation
of such a program is bas-
ed on several considera-
tions. “We feel that, by
developing the potential of
‘risk cases,’ we can do a
great service fo the peo.
ple involved and to the
state of North Carolina,’
he sald. “This program is a
major way In which Da-
vidson can meet its extra-
campus responsibilities.”
“Facilities here which lie

Paradoxical ‘Right You Are’
To Appear In Hodson Hall

“Any force that will make
people think. that will make
them weigh values, that will
cause them to recognize the
rights of others, that will
make them tolerant, is im-
portant.”

Those words of Italian
playwright Luigi Pirandello
‘explain some of the thought
underlying his creation of
“Right You Are,” a comedy
about truth. to be presented
at Davidson Feb. 20-22.
nightly at 8:15.

The play will be present.
ed in Hodson Hall using a
raked stage, first of its kind
at Davidson. according to
director Rupert T. Barber
Jr., chairman of the Drama
Department at Davidson.

Costumes will be nearly
monochromatic, using vari-
ous shades of grey to symbo-
lize ‘that truth is neither
black nor white.” although
strong touches of color have
been added for variety and
interesst, Barber said.

When Pirandello wrote the
play in 1917, he described it
as ‘‘a parade in three acts,”
but some people feel that
“a paradox in three acts’
would be a better descrip-
tion, Barber commented.

“Although over half a cen-
tury has passed since its
first presentation, the play
is still one that involves its
audience and evokes a strong
response when the curtain
falls on the last act,” he
added.

‘The cast’ includes Mrs.

Constance Welsh, Mrs.
Louise Martin. Mrs. Ellen
Winkler, and Mrs. Mary

Rose Davis, all veterans of
Davidson College drama
productions and residents of
the town. Mrs. Kathy Mac-
Lean of Davidson and Mrs.
Ellen Johnston of Moores-
ville will also play important
roles.

idle in the summer can be
put to work for a good pur-
pose. Another benefit of the
program is that it will give
a number of Davidson stu.
dents. the opportunity for re.
warding summer work. In
shart. .a great deal of good
and. very little harm,can re-
sult from our program.”
Kilpatrick said.

Having decided to start
such a program. Morrow
and Kilpatrick did some re
search into the operation of
several programs, similar
to the summer high school.
which are held around the
country.

When their research was
completed. the two juniors
wrote a report outlining the
objectives, general make-up.
and cost of a summer high
schoo! program.

The report states that the
summer high school's speci-
fic goals are to stimulate in
students a genuine excite.
ment about learning, to ac-
quaint each student with his
own strengths and weak
nesses and help him find his
plave in society, and to de
velop each student’s aware
ness, creativity, and leader.
ship ability.

The student body would
consist of sixty males, ris-
ing juniors in North Caro-
lina high schools who show
a recognizable gap between
achievement and potential.

One-third of the group is
to be from rural back-
grounds, and 40 percent of
the group is to be black.

The summer high school
will begin in 1970, according
to the report. It will last for
seven weeks, and will in-
volve intensive study in the
area of intellectual history,
English composition, math,
and the creative arts. These
courses will be taught by
members of the Davidson
faculty and by outstanding
high school teachers from
around the state.

College and graduate
students will be used as
tutors, which will involve
playing the double role of
teacher and counselor to
individual students and the
coordination of. the pro-

Guidance Counsel Plans
Still Unsure - Workman

By STEVE CROSS

“I can say what has been
done, but I can't say what
the prospects are for a clini-
cal psychologist here at Da-
vidson.”” said Psycholoby
Professor Dr. W. G. Work.
man.

Several studies have been
made of the counseling situa-
tion at Davidson. Dr. Ben
Barger of the University of
Florida made a study last
year and recommended
that the college employ a
full-time clinical psycholo-
gist.

Dr. Henry Weitz, director
of counseling services of
Duke University, was invited
by the committee to assess
the situation this year. No
action has been taken on his
recommendations.

It has also been suggested
that Davidson cooperate
with nearby colleges to em-
ploy a professional psycho-
logist, Workman said.

Workman has handled this

job for his 18 years’ tenure
at Davidson.

‘In 1951, he was given the
job of helping students with
emotional problems.  Al-
though he referred some of
them to specialists off cam-
pus, the job became too big
for him to handle in addi-
tion to his regular class load.

During the first semester
of 1964-1965, Workman was
relieved of a fourth of his
classes in order that he have
time to spend in clinical
work with students. In the
second semester of the same
year, he studied the counsel-
ing services of several col-
leges in various parts of the
country.

In 1966 the Board of Trus-
tees authorized an expansion
of the school’s clinical ser-

vices.

Last year a committee for
guidance counseling was ap-
pointed. Dr. Workman was
the chairman, serving with

The report goes on to point
out that the program will
measure its effectiveness
through systematic testing
at various phases of the
student's development. Con-
tinuing contact with the stu
dent, through correspon.
dence and personal contact
with college representatives

will provide an adequate
follow up for the program.

Kilpatrick said that he
and Morrow had contacted
several foundations in cén-
nection with financing the
program. He said that the
response to their inquires
had been enthusiastic,” but
that no definite agreement
had yet been reached.

“Our next important step
is to involve faculty mem-
bers and students in the pro-
gram."’ said Kilpatrick, “If
the foundations we have ap.
proached can be shown that
the faculty and student body
are behind us, it will make
fund-raising much easier."

Morrow went on to point
out that this involvement
would be in both the plan-
ning and execution stages of
the program. “I can’t emp-
hasize too strongly the fact
that no definite plans for the
program have yet been

Attacks
Writs

Dean of Students Richard
C. Burts Jr. said that he
plans to study and challenge
the Court of Appeals writs
which bar carnpusing, limit
room séarching, and limit
college jurisdiction in off-
campus activities.

Burts has questioned the
authority of the writs issued
last week on grounds of jur-
isdiction and application.

“I'm not sure whether the
Court of Appeals has juris-
diction in areas where it has
apparently taken jurisdic-
tion in issuing.

He questioned the Court's
right to rule on the Code of
Responsibility, noting that
the Court of Appeals derives
its authority from the SGA
Constitution.

“The present Court of Ap-
peals,"’ Burts said, “‘is, in my
‘view. unrelated to ° the
Code.” ,

“I question whether the
Court of Appeals is speaking
to the entire campus com.
munity.” Burts said, refer.

courts orders.

made," he said. “We feel
that the only way to create
a really effective curriculum
is to get the participatior of
faculty members and _ stu-
dents.””

Kilpatrick said that, in
the near future, copies of
the report would be made
available to faculty mem.
bers. This move wil} be fol-
lowed by a ‘Question and-
Answer" session in the Mor
rison Room, open to every.
one.

He said that the summer
high school program was the
most feasible way in which
Davidson could meet _ its
extra - campus responsibili-
ties. “‘The beauty of the pro-
gram."' he pointed out. ‘‘is
that it will allow us to meet
our social obligations with
out sacrificing admission
standards."

One of the largest chapel
audiences of the year heard
White House Fellow Robert
Haas speak Tuesday on stu-
dent misunderstanding of in-
fluential government and
business officials.

Haas told the student that
many young people have the
idea that ‘‘biggies’’ make de-
cisions only for themselves.
‘“Biggies’’ was the team
Haas gave to. influential
people being criticized by
student activists.

Haas said that many stu-
dent activists think that
““biggiers’’ weild great pow-
er over many people. Stu-
dent activists often think
“biggies to be’ irresponsi-
ble and selfish in using this
supposed great power, he
said.

Haas explained that his
work with ‘‘biggies'’’ showed
him that they were intelli-
gent and will qualified peo-
ple. ‘‘People who criticize
‘biggies’ don’t understand
them and why they make
the decisions they do.”

Haas graduated from The
University of California at
Berkely as a Phi Beta Kap-
pa in 1964, He was valedic-
torian of his class. He has
also worked in the Peace
Corps and holds a degree
from Harvard Business
School.
