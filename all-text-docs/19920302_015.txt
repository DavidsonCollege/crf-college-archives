Men's Tennis Thrashes ECU,
Falls to Wake Forest and Virginia

By Robert Grubb
The men’s tennis team opened
up the toughest weekend of its
season Friday afternoon with a5-1
win over East Carolina. The Wild-
cats clinched the victory by win-
ning five of the six singles matches.
Coach Jeff Frank was espe-
cially pleased with the team’s per-
formance because the team has not
had an opportunity to play a lot of
singles. “With the doubles tourna-
ment last weekend we haven’t
playedalot of singles,” said Frank.
“IT was really surprised that we

played as well as we did.”
The team started the doubles

matches and won all three of the*

first sets, but the match was called
because of darkness. Frank also
wanted to rest the team for Satur-

day’s matches against Wake For-
est and Virginia.

Davidson played Wake Forest
on Saturday morning, and the ‘Cats
continued their strong singles play.
“I was really pleased with the ef-
fort of the team and the way they
fought back,” said Frank.

Albie Varoski came back from
down 5-0 in the second to win and
force athird set, holding two match
points in the process. Daniel Grin-
nan also held on to win despite
losing four straight games at one
point in the second set. David
Jespersen rebounded from a loss
on Friday to beat a strong Wake
opponent.

The strongest performance of
the match may have been turned in
by Holt Vaughan. After losing the

Holland Addresses State
of the Athletic Department

By Bruce Balestier
In a recent discussion which
touched on a number of different
issues, Davidson athletic director

Terry Holland voiced his opinion
on his broadcasting work, occur-
rences at the recent NCAA Con-
vention and Davidson’ s imminent
return to the Southern Conference.

Holland was adamant about
clearing up the controversy over
his television work for ESPN and
Jefferson-Pilot Sports. He contin-
ues to broadcast Western Athletic
Conference games for ESPN, and
recently has begun to work ACC
broadcasts for JP Sports, including
the February 8 Wake Forest-North
Carolina game. Since Holland is
usually referred to as “former Vir-
ginia coach and now the athletic
director at Davidson” at least once
agame, the college certainly gains
exposure from Holland’s TV work.
Said Holland, “TI look at that as a
chance to promote Davidson.”

Inaddition, itseems likely that
Holland’s growing stature in the
broadcasting world will help
Davidson, directly and indirectly.
Already, Holland has been named
to the NCAA's Men’s Basketball
‘Tournament Committee, a pres-
tigious position which will allow
him to help with the selection of
the 64-team field and the admini-
stration of the NCAA Men’s Bas-
ketball Tournament.

Holland admits that the time

he spends away from Davidson

broadcasting could create a con-—

flict of interest. “Certainly, thereis
the possibility ofa conflict of inter-
est,” he said, “but I hope to try to
avoid that as much as possible
through giving back money to the
Wildcat Club.” To that end, Hol-
land will give all of the money he
earns through broadcasting this
year to the Wildcat Club.
Holland also addressed some

of the issues decided at the recent
NCAA Convention, including the
veto of the proposed I-AAA foot-
ball division for schools which play
Division III football and Division
lin all other sports. He stated that
Davidson will declare itself- a
Division II football program for
next year (as it would have done
anyway). The following year, ironi-
cally, the program will be reclassi-
fied as I-AA, but will continue to
play a Division III schedule. By
failing to meet I-AA scheduling
requirements, the football program
will be put on restricted status but
will continue to playa Division III
schedule. “Really our status will
not have changed,” Holland said.
With regard tothe more strin-
gent academic reforms passed at
the convention, Holland said that
they will ‘hurt [Davidson] slightly
to begin with.” Since higher-pro-
file schools will be forced to re-
cruit better students, Davidson
coaches will encounter more com-

‘petition for the athletes they have

traditionally recruited. Eventually,
though, Holland feels that the re-
forms will help Davidson by pro-
ducing a more level playing field.

According to Holland,
Davidson’ s transition to the South-
ern Conference continues to pro-
ceed smoothly. The wrestling team
is competing in the Southern this
season, and most other teams will
follow suit next year. In addition,
the conference has adopted Hol-
land’s suggestion that most men’s
basketball games be played on
Saturday and Sunday afternoons.
Next year Davidson will have only
twoconferenceroad games during
the week, cutting missed class time
considerably. All in all, Holland
said, “Everything has worked as
well as we could possibly have
hoped for.”

Davidson will begin Southern Conference play in women’s basketball.
- But Filar has five recruits lined up already, and insists that he’s more
excited than apprehensive. He sees this year’s team as a foundation.
_ “They stayed focused on what we really wanted to accomplish. They set
the tone for the future of the program.”

first set badly Vaughan rallied to
force a third set. He also fell be-

hind in the third, but came back to
win 6-4. Vaughan’s win insured a
3-3 singles split. “Being tied with
ateam like thisis where we want to
be going into the doubles,” said
Frank. “This is a measure of our
strength and depth.”

All three Davidson doubles

sets, but fell just short. The final
doubles match was called after
Wake captured the first two, and
the Demon Deacons took a 5-3
win.

The men’sand women’s teams
will both host Kenyon on Tuesday.
