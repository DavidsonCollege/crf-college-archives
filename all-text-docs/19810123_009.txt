Experience helps students

By TOM PAFFORD
Staff Correspondent

Have you ever thought about
canning fish in Alaska? Or
drilling for oil in the Gulf of
Mexico? Or building a church in
Appalachia?

Students have done all three
with the help of the Office of
Experiential Programs and
Life-Work Planning.

Life after Davidson is a
constant concern of students.
Liberal arts colleges like David-
son tend to ignore the voca-
tional aspects of our education.
However; the Office of Exper-
iential Programs exists to com-
plement our formal education
with placements, career plan-
ning, and experiential pro-
grams.

Director Ken Woods and
assistant Suzie Sommers said
they prefer to avoid the ‘‘meat-
market’’ situation in which
students are shuffled from one
interviewer to another in an
effort to ‘‘sell the product.’’
Admittedly, there is no glut of
prospective employers on cam-
pus at any one time. Wood
pointed out that many busi-
nesses overlook Davidson be-
cause students lack technical,
accounting, and computer
skills. The Office promotes in-
stead a combination of self-
knowledge and experience, hop-
ing to get students acquainted
with fields that interest them.
According to Wood, ‘‘Contacts
are the name of the game.’’

The Office also offers tradi-
tional careers awareness strat-
egies. Career path seminars,
which bring recent graduates

back-to talk about their jobs,
and seminars in Charlotte with
people in management positions
are integrated with resume.
and job-hunt workshops, grad-
uate school presentations, and
interviews with business repre-
sentatives.

These activities are success-
ful for what they are designed to

do, but Wood believes there is
no easy answer to the question,
‘‘Where is my niche in the
world?”’ Some students believe
that ‘‘to be mature you have to
know what you want to do.”

To assist students with these

questions, the Office designs

Life-Work Planning Work-
shops. In these, students ex-
plore their skills and values
through individual and group
exercises. Freshmen and soph-
omores are especially urged to
participate.

Ken Wood

But what about those fish we
were going to can?

For the student with a special
career interest—most less ex-
otic than canning fish—there
are Experiential and Extern
programs during the spring and
summer break. Wood said the
program is 90 percent effective
in placing students in their
desired situation.

By offering students the op-
portunity to explore their inter-
ests early, Wood hopes to equip
them to pursue their own job,
making semior placement

Davidson has a problem,
Wood noted, because its climate
does not give sufficient pridrity
to finding. out. about oneself.
‘Many students erroneously
feel that. a grade in a-class is

more important than their life,’”

he said.

The Office receives some crit-
icism for being idealistic and
not sufficiently involved with
senior placement. Wood, how-
ever, said he wants to help
students realize that they can

themselves.

Film Review

NICK GRAHAM

commercial cinemas, an Arts house and innumerable Film

.One of the greatest pleasures of your film critic's
undergraduate days across the Atlantic—in a city served by. 2

societies—was the experience of spending whole weeks -
circulating among matinee and evening showings at the various
cinemas, never seeing the same film twice. For those of you who
were among the many foolish enough to miss The Ruling. Class
in Love on Tuesday, there is still time to gain your fix of
cinematic excellence, as the following schedule devised for the
next seven days shows. Those of you with cars, or friends
aspiring to be chauffeurs, will find that the next week should be
a rich time for the budding cinephile.

Tonight (Thursday) presents the rare chance of seeing Jean
Coctreau’s early masterpiece Orphee. Shown in Perkins at 7:30
p.m., it’s free, and the first of a series of classics of the French
cinema. Those of you with wheels have the difficult choice of
going into Charlotte instead to see a double-bill of films by
German director Wernor Herzog at the Visulite. Woycek and
Aguirre, The Wrath of God both star Klaus (Nosferatu) Kinski
and are highly praised. The former is a screen adaptation of
Bruckner’s innovative 19th century drama; Aguirre is an
apocalyptic vision of a group of conquistadores penetrating to
the heart of darkness in the New World.

On Friday, the Pop Films Committee, under the coruscating
regis of celluloid mogul Tim Newcomb present a double-bill of
comedy. Start the Revolution Without Me features Gene Wilder
in the Reign of Terror, and The Twelve Chairs is a Mel Brooks
funny centered around a jewel-chase. In Love at 8 and 10,
respectively.

The weekend presents another chance to see Kubrick’s 2001:
A Space Odyssey at the Visulite. Too bad they were scooped by
our very own Fine Films last term. It’s still worth it, of
course, for a glimpse of Leonard (Reggie Perrin) Rossiter as
the Russian scientist. On the 23rd and 24th (Friday and
Saturday) at 7:00 and 9:45 p.m.

Over the next few days the hard-working cinephile can take a
rest, or alternatively take himself off to one of the
commercial-circuit houses in Charlotte still showing The
Elephant Man, an entrancing investigation into the dangers of
voyeurism—and much else besides. John Hurt is magnificient
as the degraded star of a Victorian freak-show. If anybody out
there still hasn’t seen it he should be consulting the cinema
listings in local papers by now. Pausing to refresh him (or
her)self with a night or two hard at work in the library, the
Davidson film-watcher is then recommended to reserve
Wednesday evening for Forbidden Planet. The Fine Films
Committee’s latest flirtation with science-fiction, this all-too-
rarely seen classic of the genre is showing in Love at 8:00 p.m.
Have a good week.

Mellow Mann plays Midwinters

By NEIL SONDOV
Staff Correspondent
Herbie Mann, renowned jazz
flutist, will perform at the
Midwinters concert on Friday,
Jan. 30.

Herbie Mann

Mann will be accompanied by
his band The Flute and Percus-
sion Theatre, made up of flute,
bass, and a wide variety of
percussion instruments.

Over the past twenty years,

Mann has recorded fifty al-
bums, ranging in style from
Latin to Middle Eastern to
Memphis funk. Mann even
ventured into disco on the
advice of his former sponsor,
Atlantic Records. Last year
Mann and Atlantic parted
ways, and he and The Flute and
Percussion Theatre have been
on tour since.

Mann’s recent concerts have
won him praise. A New Orleans
critic recently referred to one of
Mann’s concerts as ‘‘a lesson in
the essence of jazz improvisa-
tion.”

Union Concert Chairman
Dana Bolton said, ‘‘We always
try to get a mellow act for
Midwinters and leave the hard-
er stuff for the fall and spring.
We're really happy to have
gotten Herbie Mann.”

Tickets for the 8 p.m. per-
formance go on sale Wednes-
day, Jan. 21. The price for
students and faculty is $3.00 in

. advance and $5.00 on the day of

the show. The cost for the
general public is $6.00. Tickets
may be picked up Monday
through Friday at the Union
. Ticket Office from 2 p.m, to 5
p.m.
