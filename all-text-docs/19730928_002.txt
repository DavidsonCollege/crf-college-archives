Convocation Speech Receives
Varied Community Reactions

By TOM AINSWORTH
Contributing Editor

As one Senior class member
put it, ‘It wasn’t the kind of
speech that made you want to
jump and cheer,” but most
people seemed to think that
president Samuel Spencer’s
convocation address covered
well the topics of relevant in-
terest to the Davidson Com-
munity.

“I don’t think, simply by the
way the college is set up, that
the president could come up
with very many answers to
these problems,"’ said Assistant
Director of the Union Duff
Bruce. ‘‘What he basically
wanted to do was let the people
know what he thinks the
problems are.”’

Picking out different points of
the speech, Bruce made par-
ticular reference to the fact that
very little of the issues
discussed had been super-
ficially treated.

The only topic which needed
more consideration, according
to Bruce, was in the area of the
Governance Committee’s con-
siderations, a feeling shared by
SGA president Bo Phillips.

“What the committee is
proposing is not as big a change
as the college needs and I think
that they need to be changed,”’
said Bruce.

“I was very much upset with
the faculty's proposal that they
should keep their body
sacred,’’ commented Phillips.
“The idea that something will
be lost by having a student
come in and listen on their
meetings is ridiculous.’’

The main part of Spencer’s
talk, concerning the future of
both major and minor sports on
the campus, was considered
well-covered by most faculty
and students, however opinions
differed on the various roles
that each should play in the
athletic program.

‘*T don’t see how we are going
to fund the minor sports,”
Phillips stated. *‘I don’t want to
see a higher percentage of the
budget going into athletics.

‘‘His comments about helping
out the minor sports worry me -
I don’t know what he means by
that since it wasn’t in the rough

draft of the speech. And ob-
viously something has to be
done about the gym, but at the
same time I think we should try
to match the Reynolds fund and
refurnish Martin Science
building.

On the other hand, Assistant
professor of Art Herb Jackson
was “pleased about the com-
ments concerning the general
student body’s athletic needs,
mainly the fact that the women
need new facilities.”

“I also liked the idea of deem-
phasizing football, but not to the
extent that I would like to see it
go,’’ Jackson said.

Both did agree on the ap-
pointment of Thomas Cartmill
as new Athletic Director,
however.

“I was on the committee to
choose the new director,’
Phillips stated, ‘and was really

Students Report 2

By CHARLES KENNON
Staff Writer

This year 26 bicycle thefts
have been reported by David-
son students. The number of
‘“‘borrowed’’ bikes that haven't
been reported for some reason
or another isn’t known, but is
probably as high.

Davidson Police Chief Hebron
Mills and Director of the
Physical Plant Grover Meetze
expressed concern about this
problem. Meetze said that part
of the crime wave is due to the
large number of bikes on cam-
pus. “This is the first year
we've had so many. The num-
ber of bicycles is triple that of
last year.”

Both strongly recommended
that students with bikes attend
the registration to be held
Saturday. It will last from 9
a.m. to 1 p.m. Having the serial
number registered with the
police is about the only way of
recovering a stolen or lost bike,
Mills said:

He added that ‘This regis-
tration is free and the per-
son gets a card saying that we
have the serial number and
model of the bike. Also, we keep
a copy of the card on our files.”’

excited about Cartmill’s ideas.”

“For the first time, | felt a
real positive thrust was being
made to face the situation,
especially concerning the
Union,” said Director of the
Union C. Shaw Smith.

“He showed us that these
things could all work more
together, but that it was up to us
to make them work. He more or
less pointed the way,’’ Smith
continued.

Jackson and a few others
were not that enthused with the
points of the talk, however.

“It was really nothing new,
except for the appointment of
the Athletic Director,’’ Jackson
pointed out. ‘‘He mostly talked
about the allocation of space,
which was no surprise, but he
didn’t say where the Art Depar-
tment was going.

There is a bike safety check and
those passing it get a sticker.
“The first day of school was
the worst. People were careless
and left their bikes laying
around. So thieves came up and
walked of with them” said
Meetze.

“Some still don’t have a lock
on the bikes or they have cheap
ones that are easy to pick.
Everyone should have a good
strong lock and chain them to
the racks.

‘‘We ordered new racks at the
start of the year and they should
arrive any day,’’ Meetze said.
He mentioned that a new
student security program will
be put into effect soon.

Some concern was expressed
over the tutorial program.
Children being tutored
sometimes bring their friends
onto campus and they roam
around.

“I’m not pointing any fingers,
but some of these children could
be involved. One boy confessed
and not only did he have several
bikes but he had collected
enough parts to build any brand
you could want. And they file
the serial numbers off and
repaint them. The Davidson
people should be more careful,”’
Mills urged strongly.

In the same tone he reported
that about half a dozen uniden-
tified bikes are at the police
station. Any one who has had

mine how this committment should be defined, and how it can be
given visible and effective witness”.
i = HOUSING: While indicating the plans for more housing (5 or 6

have to be made on how to pay for them.

library as soon as the E-H.Little Library is completed. When a new

Students Elect New Senators

By BRUCE CORSER
Managing Editor

Due to Wednesday’s runoff
election of dormitory represen-
tatives, the student Senate
(SGA) activities were
somewhat curtailed at
Tuesday’s meeting. However,
Bob Palmer of Cannon, one of
those elected prior to the runoff,
was sworn in as senator.

Other elected dorm represen-
tatives include: Alan Blakely,
Duke; Janet Whitehurst, Little;
Lee Grogan, Richardson; John
Kepchar, -Sentelle; Lynne
Keener, Watts; Chris Allison
and John Douglas, off-campus;
Bob Penny, Chuck Weber, and
Ed Willingham, Belk. Also.
Steve Keener, Cannon and Beth
Schulhof, Little were elected to
spots on the Dorm Social Coun-
cil.

Further elections will be held
Tuesday, October 2 for fresh-
man class Senators and for
RHA members. A runoff bet-
ween Dan Henderson, Bill
Mcliwain, and Dennis Tweedy
for the Conduct Council will be
held the same day.

In the Wednesday runoff, 583
students participated in the
voting.

At the Senate meeting, in-
cumbents heard Steve Can-
terbury disclose that an at-
tempt was being made to obtain
four more study rooms _ in
Chambers. One room would be
designated as a typing room.
These would be in addition to
the four currently being used.

This action is being taken as a
result of the closing of the
Honors College after 11 p.m
This building and Phi Hall, both

open all night last year, are
thought to be security risks.
Steve Dodd of the
Educational Policy Committee
(EPC) revealed that the studen-
ts of the committee will be
pushing for the adoption of the
same calender next year 1974-75
as the present one. Calenders
from other schools are under
ong term investigation, he ad-

Reporting for the Student Life
Committee, Senator Bob Cun-
ningham announced an attempt
to obtain Chambers banquet
hall as a place for parties. Cun-
ningham said that the Union
would be given first priority for
the hall but would have to reser-
ve it at least two or three weeks
ahead of time. Other groups
would be first come, first serve.
