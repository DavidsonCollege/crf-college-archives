Walter L. Lingle, chairman
of the Trustee Committee
on Campus Governance ex-
pressed the tentative belief
Wednesday that the faculty
should relinquish its admin-
istrative responsibility for
student behavior in, favor of
a Council. on Student Con-
duct.

In meetings with the facul-
ty, Student Life Committee
and student Senate, Lingle
explained ‘“‘the general
framework of thinking’’ of
the committee in order to
get reactions from members
of the college community.

‘Since the trustees are in
no position to administer a
system of student conduct,”’
said Lingle, ‘‘full authority

should be delegated by the”

trustees to the President of
the College.

“The President should es-
tablish a Council on Student
Conduct which would °furic-
tion as a policy making and
legislative body,"’ he said.
“A major part of the job of
this council would be to study
the Code of Responsibility on
a continuous basis and enact
changes as needed.”

Lingle explained that the
code is an important stand-
ard of conduct; however, at
present it is too rigid. Under
the present system it takes
a two-thirds vote of the stu-
dents and a two-thirds vote
of. the faculty for amend-
ments. He suggested that the
Council on Student Conduct
have the power to make nec
essary Changes in the code.

The composition of this
council has not been deter
mined. One idea*which has

been suggested, according to
Lingle, was to have a l4-
man committee; seven stu-
dents (the four class presi-
dents, the student body pres-
ident, and two students ap-
pointed by the student body
president), Dean of Students
(chairman), Chaplain, Stu-
dent Coordinator, and four
faculty members elected by
that body.

“The only restriction on
the power of that council,”
said ‘Lingle, ‘‘would be if the
President of the College felt
the proposed change was in
contradi¢tion™of any known
policy or trustee standards.

‘He could suspend activa
tion of the change until the
matter could be referred to
“the Trustee Executive Com-
mittee within one month af
ter its proposal,’’ he said.

be revised as well. Lingle
suggested that all rules and
regulations of the college be
enumerated along with their
specific sanctions. These
rules and regulations may be
divided into two groups.
One group will consist of
administrative regulations

such as parking violations
and Residence Hall viola
tions. These regulations

would be administered by
the Dean of Students.

Lingle, “the judicial proced-

night as the SGA ratified the
proposal 12-3.

Since the proposal irfvolves
a change in the faculty con
stitution, ten per cent of the
faculty must draw up a ‘peti
tion endorsing the resolution
before it can be brought be-
fore the faculty for consi
Jeration.

Student Senate President
Danny Clodfelter hopes that
the faculty will consider the
proposal this spring.

When questioned about his
opinion of the proposal, Di-
rector of Admissions and Fi-
nancial Aid H. Edmunds
White said, ‘‘I am in favor of
the principle of students sit-
ting on the committee for the
purpose of making policy.

“T will not try to influence
the faculty decision, Howev-
er, if I am asked, I will state
my position.”

The resolution, formulated
by Bob Wallace, Ran Coble
and Allen Peterson, states:
“Be it resolved that a re-
quest be made to the faculty
to amend relevant sections
of the faculty constitution;
that three students be ad-
mitted as members of the
Admissions and Financial
Aid Committee as_ voting
members in policy making
functions.

Wallace explained that a
recommendation to allow stu
dents to see confidential in
formation was not included
in the proposal because of
the opposition of high school
counselors.

“The responses that we got
from questionnaires sent out
to high school guidance coun-
selors revealed much opposi-
tion to the idea of students
viewing: confidential files.

‘Many counselors express
ed the conviction that they
would noe longer be com-
pletely candid with Davidson
College if students were ad-
mitted to committees dealing
with classified material.”

The questionnaire, drawn
up by Coble and Peterson,
solicited responses from ap
proximately 200 secondary
schools on their favor of or
opposition to students being
members of admissions com
mittees.

The computed percentages
of responses revealed that a
majority favored students on

SGA Backs Admissions Proposal

White expressed approval
of the way the whole pro
posal was handled, “I was
pleased that they did not ask
that students be put on the
committee to read ‘confiden-
tial material,

“IT want guidance counse-
lors to have confidence in
Davidson procedures,”

Clodfelter was optimistic
over the chances of the reso-
lution passing the faculty
this spring.

“By getting Mr. White’s
support’ and by following the
proper constitutional proce-
dures, we should be able to
meet most faculty objections
and get the proposal passed
this spring.”

In other action, the senate
endorsed the People's Peace
Treaty presented by senator
Mark Meza by a vote of
8-4-1 and had it*sent on to
the National Student Associa-
tion.

Editors Russ Merritt and
Don Parman have also sign-
ed the. treaty.

“The senate’s endorsement
does not necessarily mean
that the student body endor-
ses the treaty. What it does
signify is that the senate rep-
resenting the student body
endorses it,’’ Clodfelter af-
firmed.
