GON CHAPEL SERVICES—

As evidenced by the response to the pro-
grams given the latter part of last week, the
student move to improve interest in chapel
has accomplished much toward reaching its
goal. Hall prayer groups seem to have done
wonders in making the movement for more
interest in chapel programs the popular thing.
Perhaps after a little listening to the talks, we
will realize that the programs themselves
aren't the only things ea were lacking in for- "|
mer chapel services—sttdent attitude in chapel
is the point where the greatest improvement
needs to he made. ‘ Thursday’s, Friday’s and
Saturday's chapel exercises seemed to fill the
bill as far as programs are concerned. After
meeting the persons in charge half way, stu-
dents seemed surprised that chapel could be
interesting and helpful.

Variation adds to the chapel program as
much as anything. A talk read without much
thought or preparation never has and shouldn’t
be tolerated.

Although the suggestion to do away with
the chapel service on Saturday might have
had a dual purpose, the forwarding of the idea
should tend to do away with the feeling’ of
restlessness and impatience during the other
chapel periods, Poor attitude this one day
might have a psychological effect on the stu-
dent attitude on the other days of the week.

Some persons have suggested that we do
away with student announcements entirely.
We think that the idea is absurd since a great
many of the announcements read are absolute-
ly important, and, too, that activities an-
nounced as they have been in the past have a
sort of hinding effect on the student body—
you feel closer to the other six-hundred and
forty-nine if you know what’s going on around
you on the campus. Some people are a little
inconsiderate in having the student body lis-
ten to announcements such as, “Richard Doe
please-meet me behind the senior section after
chapel,” and elimination of the unimportant’
announcements is needed.

The main point to stress toward making the’
chapel services more worshipful is student in-
terest in making them so. If, as seems to be
happening right now, a majority of the stu-
dents in Davidson want better chapel pro-
grams, we'll have them!

Now that the movement is rolling, less criti-
cism toward the present system seems to be

If there is a series of talks fol-
lowing our recent low ebb in chapel exercises
telling the students what’s wrong with them,
the slump will continue. Let’s not look back
on the past, but only on the present and future
in regard to this matter.

hand, and their interdependence is the solu-
tion to our problem.

| Having often wondered how it feels to be

promised to be our best assignment in two
years, we shouldered our pencils and set out
to interview in their lair one of America’s
most suppressed minorities, Davidson’s coeds.

prepared for some of our findings. Here is
an expurgated copy of the results.

In the first place, they were divided as to
their feelings about Davidson. One of them
was openly enthusiastic, two were luke-warm,
and one definitely disliked it. None of them
plan to come back next year. All of them
frown upon the idea of having more coeds.

Three admitted “that they felt a little
conscious at first and even now “when
whistle when we come in late to class.” The
fourth-stated bluntly that having lived here
all her life nothing bothered her any more.

self-
they

As to their ideas about Davidson students,
they think Davidson boys are above the aver-
age. They agreed that on the whole Davidson
boys are ‘very neat, “although I wish some of
them would shave.%! One of this lovely mi-
nority considered Davidson boys much less
mature than others. They all had something
to say about boys “that peroxide their hair
every springt’--fhey-did not think that the
spirit at Davidson is what it-should be, and
especially criticised “the sarcastic attitude of
many of them,’ although all of them certainly
are nice to us.”

As for their ideal Davidson man, one wanted
him “to be good in everything, and studying,
too.” Two sighed and said dreamily, “Hank
Robinson.” When asked who they considered
was the cutest man on the campus, two re-
fused to venture an opinion, one picked Bobby
Carter, and the other nominated Prof. Frontis
Johnston,

The social life at Davidson, they think, is
good. They believe that Davidson dances are
“the best.” The majority favored football and
baseball as their favorite sport, although one
emphatically chose golf.

Reginning, by this time, to feel rather em-
barrassed we asked for an_endorsement of the
DAVIDSONIAN, The first made us happy by
saying that she read every word except the
sports page. She then broke our bubble by
accusing us of “seldom § getting things
straight.” Another thought it should include
some good jokes. (She refused to comment
on the magazine), "

Realizing that the laundry had sent us a

size ten collar, and that our face had become a
strange shade of scarlet and purple, we stum-

bled out, hearing in the distance the parting
shots of Davidson’s loveliest, at last allowed to
express themselves.

YY’ Corner

Dr. Barbour is ending a great series of serv-
ices tonight. Watch for a lasting value from
them. We'll hear more and feel more from
them later.

Mentioning the name of a man on our cam-
pus who works, and works with absolutely
no credit expected or received, we could say
Bill MacLauchlin, Bill MacLauchlin, Bill Mc-
Lauchlin. No kidding there is not enough}
space for credit. It does us good to see men
like that and they are so hard to find and so

hard to be like—Bill, yours is a room-filled-
with-orchids—and so much deserved.

Sherrill Chapel received the good musical
work of Fenton Miller, Bob Hutcheson, Bob
Patton, and David Sadler last Sunday. . That
is real mission work, and less than a mile from
Davidson, Again that name Bill MacLauch-
lin comes to the fore. He gave the sermon.
See what I mean?

Huffines—-the Utility Man—carted Joe
Barnwell and Tootsters over to the colored
school for their big show. All safe and sound;
too.

Chapel question again. Have you noticed
the difference in the tone of the service lately?
Bob Johnson, Bob Balsley, and others inter-
ested certainly did a real job in approaching
the problem from the student-in-the-seat an-
gle. The others can be none other than the
entire student body,-alt-of whom ‘made con-
certed consecrated effort toward a more wor-
shipful spirit for those few minutes in the day
to be closer to God.

Do you like the idea of boys offering prayer
from the floor during the service? So many
have said they do.

The plate contains a piece of potato, a scrap of meat, and a dab of fat.

On the table we see a hunk of bread and some tiny lumps of sugar.

New York (Special) —Whatyou
see above does not depict a meal.
[t shows what a Belgian gets to eat
during an entire day.

He gets:—eight ounces of bread
and one-third of one ounce of fat.
He gets an ounce and one-half of
meat, no bigger than a third of a
package of cigarettes and not even
one whole potato. Then he has an
vunce and three-quarters of sugar.

This photograph was taken in
New York City, but is based upon
authentic information from _ over-
seas, sent to the National Commit-
tee on Food for the Small Democra-
cles, of which Mr. Herbert Hoover
is honorary chairman, Three famine

Theoretically, rations are larger.
for instance, there should be tive

a tiny heap of beans, a bit of oat-
meal and some “ersatz” coffee. But

food to supply even these terrib'y
restricted rations simply does not
exist. What you see in the picture
is what a Belgian actually gets and
must live upon--today.

What does this mean?

A human needs 2400 calories daily
to exist—-3600 if he works.

The food values on the plate rep
resent only 1038 calories.

Slow starvation, this.
But worse is to come!

By February's end the bread ra-

Letters to

the Editor

Dear Tony:

Perhaps this is a little out of or-
der, but so much criticism has-been
the system of elections
that I think that it is only fair that
that they are
such a vast improvement over past
that not pretty

given new

someone mention

vears’ it’s even
funny.

Although foremost critics keep
that. the Elections Board
is corrupt, I think the present sys-
tem has put Davidson elections on
the plane where they should be,
and little further improvement is

necessary.

hinting

In order to prove my observa-
tions, a look at other college poli-
tics seems to be sufficient. What
other campus frowns on hack-
slapping and tooth-paste - grins?
What other college elects brain
over brawn and brawn over brain
with such equanimity? Are there
many other schools whose rules
concerning elections make talking
about the candidates’ capabilities
illegal? Our critics seem to have
served their purpose in getting the

Elections Board system started and
now they are stirring the pot to
change it again.

The only criticism I have to the
present system is against the prac-
tice of revealing a “little too much
dope” from the counting of the
votes. If there could be some way
to stop the slipping out of how the
Zeta Zoo's went, I think thatthe]
present system is just about as good
as it can be,

There was the element last year
that may have some remnant left
this year that is for open politics.
Imagine Davidson like one of the
big time schools where you could
do anything or say anything to cut
the other man’s throat? Surely,
we're above any such “carrying’s
on” as that!

If there should be any question
about a change in the present sys-
tem I'd like to cast my vote against
it. I don’t profess to be a writer,
Tony, but I hope I've gotten my
feelings scross.

Yours,
ELECTED

THE THEORY AND PRAC-
TICE OF BASEBALL; AND ITS
PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT ON
COLLEGE STUDENTS.

From September until January,
radios and newspapers never worry
about filling up their sports pro-
grams or pages. A _leaf-fired,
hoarse throated, blacked and blued
atmosphere of football pervades.
But during the long, dark hours
of winter, these organs must con-
tent themselves with a sport, na-
tional in scope, to be true, but not
as frought with sensation and head-
line appeal as its predecessor. This
basketball game has to be played
and therefore does not
command as many steady devotees
football. However, sports
editors begin perking up theif ears
some time in March and from then
will lead an automatic life.
they will lead an automatid life.
They know also that before many
moons have passed, America’s great
game will have been in full swing.

Eleanor punting the first football

view the situation with alarm. We
are alarmed at the number of boys
who are gradually being squeezed
out of boarding and fraternity
house conversations. This is the
fault of the person who is- ignorant
concerning the subject of these con-
versations: Baseball. As to how this
listing is done, stop! We need go

no further. Two men are breez-
ing down to supper:

“How'd the Giants come out,
Bob?”

“T don't know. I’m sorry, I don’t
keep up with baseball scores.”

You don't keep up with baseball
scores! Poor fellow.

You don't-keep up with baseball
scores! Poor fellow. We can see
what a difficult time he’s going
to have this spring. He will attempt
to swing a bull-session towards
spring planting or girls, but it will
be to no avail. It is the ugly truth
and we must face it. Unless you
know who pitched for the Blue

cial outcast.
