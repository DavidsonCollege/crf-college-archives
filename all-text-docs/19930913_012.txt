Bob Margolin brings true blues and his band to the 900 room

Before watching Bob
Margolin play, it’s important to
understand that, despite his rela-
tively unfamiliar name, he is a
genuine bluesman.

The people he has played with
Since joining the Muddy Waters
band 20 years ago reads like a
who’s who of Blues music and the
rock n’ roll that it helped inspire:
B.B. King, John Lee Hooker, the
Rolling Stones, and Eric Clapton
are among the heavyweights
splashed across his resumé.

Like a true bluesman, Bob
Margolin stamped out on his own

over a decade ago to lead his own,
highly transient band. And like a
true bluesman, he has made the

road and its unglamorous, smoky
dives his home for most of his solo
career.

In truth, the 900 Room was
almost too pure a venue for Bob to
bring his gritty brand of blues.

The middle-aged guitaristand
his two-man backing band seemed
quite aware during their Septem-
ber 6 debut of Blues Monday that
their audience of about 100 bright-
eyed college kids came from a
completely different neighbor-
hood.

After playing a song with the
chorus “The better you treat ‘em,
the worse they treat you,” he looked
to the crowd for a moment and
laughed, “Philosophy 101.”

For the most part though, he
did notspeak. He was more at ease
letting his music, with its impro-

vised solos, rock-steady rhythms,
and words of infinite wisdom, en-
tertain. The bassist grooved unerr-
ingly and preferred to go unno-
ticed, while the drummer hid his
age by flailing his arms about his
sparse drum kit. But Margolin,
despite his drummer’s flamboy-
ance, was the one who held the
eyes of the audience.

Hidden by shades andascruffy
beard, he tore through each song
with the professionalism of a con-
cert pianist and the wisdom usu-
ally reserved for people twenty
years his senior. His rugged wails

of “I feel sodown, like aball game
onarainy day,” like his occasional
quips with band mates, drew chuck-
les from the student audience.

Everyone present got his
dollar’s worth, having seen a true
blues guitarist strut his stuff. Which
is all Bob Margolin wanted any-
way.

Before the show he said, “I
don’t want people to come and
watch it just to have some sort of
‘ethno-cultural experience.’ I just
want them to come and hear some
good music and like it and have
some fun.”

Lenny Kravitz leaves Lisa Bonet and his troubles behind

Kravitz continued from page 11

The radio definitely overplayed this
one, so it’s hard for me to look at it
objectively. It’s like Lenny wants
to establish right away that he
knows how to write rock music
and wants you to know it.

“Are You Gonna Go My
Way,” with its strong guitar line,
sets the tone for the rest of the
album, showing that he plans to
take youona musical rollercoaster
ride, on his terms.

The next song, “Believe,” is
my favorite on the whole album. It
begins with the faint, hymn-like
sound of a Wurlitzer organ, some
eery sitar playing, thena deepbass.

There is a profound sadness to this
song that Ican’texplain. Although
the lyrics are somewhat optimis-
tic, “If you want it you’ve got to
believe/ Believe in yourself,” there
is also something lonely about it,
something powerful and forlorn.

“Come On and Love Me” is
the next track, and with its driving
drum beat is reminiscent of a Led
Zeppelin song, perhaps “D’yer
Maker” or “Poor Tom.” Lenny
plays almostall the instruments on
this one.

“Heaven Help” is a quiet,
steady piece that showcases
Lenny’s distinct voice. The slow,
slightly plodding “Just Be a
Woman,” is notone ofthe stronger

cuts. But then Lenny bursts out
with “Is There Any Love In Your
Heart?” another rocker. “Baby, all
you care about/ Is Gucci and
Mercedes Benz,” Lenny wails, as
he spins a tale of a woman who
chases after his money and sleeps
with all his friends. ;

The lyrics to “Black Girl,” the
next cut, are simplistic and slightly
annoying, although the music is
inoffensive.

Lenny Kravitz has made dis-
paraging comments about the
Beatles before, but on the song
“My Love,” it seems painfully
obvious that the Beatles were a big
influence. The music is reminis-
cent of the Beatles song “Tomor-

row Never Knows” and has a fu-
turistic, Eastern sound to it.
“Sugar” is a classic Lenny Kravitz
song, at once ballroom dancing
and rock ballad. On “Sister,” a
slow, acoustic number, Lenny’s
voice is almost raw with stark
emotion.

The album ends with the obvi-
ously reggae-influenced piece,
“Eleutheria,” an optimistictune of
utopia and heightened conscious-
ness. “Got to keep on/ keep on
keeping on” Lenny says in the last
line, borrowing a phrase most of-
ten attributed to Bob Dylan.

You get the feeling that
Lenny’s moving on, rising to some
other plane of consciousness and

leaving his troubles, and Bonet,
behind him.

It’s easy to detect influences
in Lenny Kravitz’s music, but he
uses those influences to create
something entirely original. In
these days where a lot of modern
music is filled with desperation,
bitterness and noise, it’s refresh-
ingtohearsomeone whostill writes
tuneful music.

This whole CD is strong and
skillfully executed, and if Kravitz
can continue to grow musically as
he has on this one, there’s no tell-
ing how far he’ll go. Catch himon
Wednesday, Oct. 6 at Indepen-
dence Arena, with special guest
Blind Melon.

Dr. John livens up JazzCharlotte festival with a mix of styles

By Ross Sloop
This past weekend the sounds
. Of jazz, blues, and gospel filled
Marshall Park and uptown Char-
lotte. Break magazine, a Charlotte
entertainment weekly billed the
event as one of the biggest annual
music festivals for the city. This
year JazzCharlotte featured over
30 different performances from

local artists as well as musicians
from around the country.

The music festival, which is
now in its eighth year, featured
New Orleans pianist Dr. John as
the headline attraction. Dr. John’s
Mardi Gras rhythms got the crowd
into a festive spirit. His music
blends various Louisiana styles
including funk, R & B, and jazz.

While Dr. John worked his
magicon the Lakeside Stage, other
performances continued on the
Jamboree, Plaza, and Fountain
Stages. Throughout Saturday and
Sunday, artists-such as Guitar
Gabriel, Snake Lady Willa Mae
Burkner, Tattoo Joe, The Persua-
sions, and Eddie Palmieri enter-
tained the crowd.

Some of the most pleasant
surprises of the festival were not
even on the program’s schedule.
AsIstrolled down one of the streets
enjoying a veggie burrito, I was
drawn towards a bohemian
precussionist delighting a crowd
by smacking an assortment of trash.

JazzCharlotte attracted a very
