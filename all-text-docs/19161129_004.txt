SCHEDULE.

Owing to Senior Speaking and ex-
aminations, there will be no more meet-
ings of the literary societies until after

In the Philanthropic Society Saturday
night those upholding the affirmative
side of the question: “Resolved, That
the President of the United States
should be elected by the direct vote of
the people and not thru the Electoral
College,” were: Howell, Carriker,
Spence and Cumming. They maintain-
ed that the present system is unfair in
that it does not represent the direct vote
of the people.

Those arguing for the Negative were:
Nisbet, Calhoun, Menzies and Finley.
They argued that the change would be
detrimental rather than beneficial. ‘The
committee decided in favor of the afirm-
ative, while the house voted for the nega-
tive.

On Monday morning those giving
Declamations were: Dunlap, “Com-
merce,” by Henry van Dyke; Caldwell,

ercises the inauguration of new officers
took place, and reports for the. first term
were given.

On Saturday night the question: “Re-
solved, That the President of the United
States should be elected by popular vote
rather than by the Electoral College,”

Frierson, Roddey, Cunningham and
Fraser, on the negative by Solomons,
Eikel, Flynn and Potts,

The arguments advanced by the
affirmative side were: (1) The electoral

college is undemocratic ; (2) makes the] pose they run on to the man track, wastes Tryen

their votes; (4) permits the election of}, single shot.

President even tho he receives a plurality
of the popular-votes,

The negative advanced such argu-
ments as these: (1) ‘he whole country
is not educated to this great change;
(2) by the proposed method an en-
croachment would be made upon State
rights; (3) there would be a greater
amount of corrupt politics in the pro-
posed system; (4) the small States
would have less power in electing the
President.

On Monday morning the following
gave declamations: P. B. Carwile, on

Recently one of our papers ran this
advertisement: “Wanted — Work at
anything by a man of 27; speaking seven
languages.”

If this young man had had the cour-
age to be ignorant of many things he
would have avoided the calamity of be-
ing ignorant of all things.

It is not how much college you have
gone through as how much of the college
has gone through you that the business
world wants to know.

The best diploma is the book of acts.
The world always makes room for the
man who can bring things to pass.

Our country is full of persons wio
can do many things fairly, but do not
know how to do one thing supremely
well.

The best workers in many lines are
foreigners who, in the Old World, de-
voted the early part of their lives to
learning a trade or profession, and
brought their superior workmanship with
them; hence we seldom find such for-
eigners looking for a job.

The day of universal knowledge i:
past. The true measure of a successful
man’s learning today is the number of
studies which he elects to let alone.

Broad culture may be beautiful and
many-sidedness admirable, but it is al-
ways the men with single ains and in-
tense purpose, who concentrate their
power, who are in demand when any-
thing worth while is to be done.

It is not the diffused electricity, but

He who knows everything is always
looking for something. The specialist
does not have to look for a job; the job
is looking for him. To succeed you must
be unanimous with yourself.

ing the chemical analysis of a plant. He
answered: “I know nothing about
chemistry.” He was a naturalist. Even
specialists have their specialty.

The men who get to the top over the
heads of a hundred others are not al-
ways the men of conspicuous ability, but

to take hold of things by their handles
has the call.
