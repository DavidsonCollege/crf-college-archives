Precinct IT Heightens
Security Procedures

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Managing Editor

Many students have noticed
that the campus security
building has undergone an
extensive renovation in the
past weeks. Also, there is a
unusual three-wheeled vehicle
putting around campus and a
freshly painted  sign--
“Davidson Police, Precinct
II’.

The sign, the cart, and the
renovated building are only
outward indications of an in-
tensification in security
procedures at Davidson.
Physical Plant Director and
chairman of the Security Com-
mittee Grover Meetze, David-
son Lieutenant J. G. Hughes,
and students like Senior Mitch
Purvis have worked out the
plan for more -effective cam-
pus security.

There are three basic com-
ponents of the revised security
system; precinct II and the
main police station in towr;
the police cart, foot patrollers,
and more direct com-
munication between the
student body and the security
force.

Precinct II serves as a junc-
tion for security activities. It
is manned during the day by
Hughes who directs activities
and coordinates nighttime
security. Hughes is respon-
sible to the main headquarters
in town and is responsible in
operational matters’ to
Meetze.

The college employs four
full-time policemen including
Hughes, and two part-time
policemen. Also, security man
R. C. Sherrill serves although
he holds no arresting powers.

Officers Johnny Ferrell,
Terry Springs, and Turner
Stutts complete the full-time
force, and officers Ronnie

Lowrance and Charles Cook
make up the part-time force.
The new security cart
facilitates rapid investigation
almost anywhere on campus
because policemen can cut

across campus instead of
having to confine their driving
to Concord Road and Main
Street. Meetze emphasized,
however that the police
patrol on foot 80% of the time.

Also, college security police
are now in direct com-
munication by short-wave
radio with each other, precin-

ct II, Meetze, and the main
police station in town.
Hughes’ praised’ the

cooperation between campus
police and students. ‘‘The of-
ficers are getting to know
studentg,”’ he said. ‘‘I believe
the system is going to work
really well.”’

Policemen in North
Carolina are required by law
to have a minimum of 168
hours of training in law en-
forcement. Davidson’s cam-
pus security policemen have
either completed the training
or are presently enrolled in

Central Piedmont College.

For eight hours a day for
four weeks policemen study
forensic science, radio com-
munications, hand to hand
combat, patrolling procedures
and other required subjects.
Also, they must meet certain
efficiency requirements in
weaponry. All police on cam-
pus are certified.

Students must take a major
role in security procedures if
the revised system is going to
work properly. Although
students do not patrol the
campus with the security for-
ce, they must keep their eyes
open for strangers in the dorms
ms and for any unusual ac-
tivity on campus. Also,
Hughes encourages students
to register their bicycles and
other valuables. An engraver
is available at the security

RENOVATED SECURITY RUILDING

Forty Apply To Fill Coaching Vacancy

GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Managing Editor

The search for a new head
football coach here at David-
son College is now drawing to
the final stages of con-
sideration, with a new coach
expected to be appointed
sometime during spring
break.

There have been nearly 40
applications and inquiries con-
cerning this position which
have been received and con-
sidered by the college ad-
ministration, according to
Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan.

‘‘We have been contacted by
many interested individuals,
ranging from high school
coaches, to assistant coaches
and head coaches at other in-
stitutions,’ Bevan explained.
‘“‘We have narrowed the list
down to four or five persons,
one of which we interviewed
on campus this week.”’

Bevan went on to explain

that the process now involved
making inquiries at the in-
stitutions from which the final
applicants came. This action
is taken to check the in-
formation supplied by the ap-
plicant to the college, as well
as to gain additional in-
formation as to the abilities of
these persons.

Bevan said he felt that there
has been some ‘‘good quality”’
in the applicants that the
college has received and con-
sidered thus far.

He also explained what type
of applicant the college was
looking for.

“Basically we are look for
three things in our new
coach,’ Bevan commented.
“Those things include ex-
perience at the head coaching
level, someone with a good
deal of coaching experience
and a man who has a good win-
ning record.”’

Bevan did not fail to express
a deep desire of the college to
obtain someone who was
willing to work under the new
guidelines which Davidson
will be applying to its football
program, beginning next fall.

“We want someone who
agrees with the basic tenets of
the Davidson situation,” ex-
plained Bevan.

It was also pointed out that
th college has received
several applications from per-
sons who have worked under
similar situations in other
football ms.

Bevan noted that he was

about to call one applicant
who is presently a head coach
under a program which is
almost exactly the same as
the one that will be here at
Davidson.

A new twist in the
proceedings came Monday
though, when a petition,
signed by 48 of the 50 varsity
football players from the 1973
squad, was handed to college

Jr. and Director of Athletics
Thomas Cartmill.

lone remaining assistant
coach, Dave Roberts for the
head coach position.

Bevan was quite frank in ad-
mitting that the ad-
ministration ‘had not an-
ticipated the petition.’’ He did
say that it was a great com-
pliment to Roberts, who has
not applied for the job.

“I talked to him (Roberts)
when we began the search for

a successor to Fagg, and he
explained that he was not in-
terested in the job at that
time,’’ Bevan explained. ‘‘He
still has not applied. But if he
did, I am sure that he could
still be considered for the

‘“‘We were” extremely
pleased when he decided to
remain here after Fagg left.
He will certainly be counted
upon to help when the new

Citizens To Distribute
Food Stamp Information

By MICHAEL TANNER
Editor-in-Chief

Beginning in the first weeks
of the spring term, an
organization known as the
Davidson Citizens Association
will initiate a drive to
distribute information about
the federal Food Stamps
program among those in the
Davidson-Cornelius communi-
ty who might qualify for the
aid.

Director of the College News
Bureau Buck Lawrimore who
is also chairman of the David-
son Citizens Association, said
that very few people who
might need food stamps and
could qualify for them know of
the program.

“The problem here is one of
information,’”’ |Lawrimore
said, ‘‘there are many people
in the area who could use Food
Stamps, but most of those
probably know nothing about
it.”

Food Stamps is a federal
food subsidy program that
allows low-income individuals
to purchase food-redeemable
stamps for less than their face
value, the discount varying
with the degree of the in-
dividual's need.

Lawrimore commented that

be strictly volunteer. Mem-
bers of the citizens association
and interested others will
distribute the stamps in-
formation through existing
community groups. Low-
income church groups will be
the first contacted.

- Lawrimore expressed hope
that Davidson students would
volunteer to help in the effort.
“This is something students
can do that’s helpful, that’s
quick and inolves no long
range committment,’ he said.

“If we have enough student
help, we’ll be able to assign a
volunteer to every potentially
needy group.”’

Lawrimore became in-
terested in the Food Stamps
program through his in-
volvement in another
