With 5 straight losses

Baseball out of S.C. race:

By STOKES PEEBLES
Staff Writer

This past week was not a
good one for the Davidson
baseball team as they lost all
five of the games they played.
With these losses the Cats
stand with a 14-23 overall
record and a 6-7 Southern Con-
ference record with two games
left in the season. After being
12-11 overall and 6-2 in the
conference earlier in the year the
Wildcats have slumped during
recent weeks and lost twelve of
their last fourteen games.

The week started out with a
12-4 loss to Pfeiffer. About the
only Davidson highlight for
that game was a John Haskell
home run. That was Haskell’s
eighth of the season and he now
stands only.two away from the
Davidson record set by All-
American George Weiker in

the mid-1970’s. On Friday Dav-

idson again lost, this time to
Winthrop 13-9. In this game the
Cats displayed a great deal of
offensive firepower but poor
defense hurt the team. John
Porter had four hits to lead
Davidson and Allen Griffin
added threé to aid the naneee
run production.

The two defeats that most
hurt the Cats came in a double-
header Saturday against Con-
ference rival Marshall. Two
victories would have placed
Davidson at the top of the
league but the defeats put
Davidson below .500 in the
conference. John Haskell went
three for three in the first game
and Rusty Colechia pitched well

but the Thundering Herd won
5-4. In the second game the
Cats were walloped 8-1. On
Monday Davidson again lost,
this time to a strong Wingate
team 7-4. John Marshall hit a
long home run, his third of the
year, to pace Davidson offen-
sively and Glenn Summers pit-
ched well in the first game he
has started this year. Jeff Ray
added three hits to the David-
son attack.

There seem to be several
opinions as to why the Wildcats
have not been performing well
as of late. Junior pitcher Jon
Young said that ‘‘the defense
finally caught up with us,” in
explaining that defense has not
been performing well lately.
Junior outfielder John Porter
summed the situation up by
commenting, “After the E.T.-
S:U. doubleheader, people
gave up and we haven't concen-
trated well since then. We were
just going through the motions.
But we’re optimistic since we’ll
have everyone coming back
next year.”’

There -have been several
strong individual efforts since
the Cats slump though. Porter
still leads the team in hitting
with a .378 average and John
Haskell is second while batting
over .350. Porter also set the
school stolen base record arid
now has 22‘for the year.

The season still is not over
but fortunately the entire team
will return next year and will
again be strong enough to
compete for the Conference
Championship.

B&BB find solution to housing problem

By BONEHEAD and

The BRICK BROTHERS

After receiving copious com-
plaints from piqued rising sen-
iors about the lack of available
off-campus housing and from
freshmen and sophomores a-
bout being put on waiting list
purgatory, the indefatigible Bill
Bolding came knocking, knock-
ing, knocking on B&BB’s

‘Chambers door seeking advice.

Being public-spirited and altru-
istic, not to mention peripatetic
and anaclitic, we volunteered
our typically timely (also time-
less): advice. Granted some of
our advice won’t please every-
one, but we’re not here to be
Mr. Nice Guy, we're here to
help a struggling young hous-
ing director.

First of all, it has come to our
attention that there is a dodder-
ing old couple that lives in a
rather large white house on
college property near the visi-
tor’s parking lot. There seems
no logical reason why this
couple needs such a house. They
don’t entertain much—even
bachelor-at-large TCPZ turns
down their party invitations.
This mansion would supply at
least 14 students with excellent

would. Instead he could set
them up quite nicely in a trailer
home in Mooresville to live out
their golden years in calm
serenity.

But what is 14 extra places
when a veritable myriad of
students are suffering from a
social dislocation that is more
traumatic than circumcision?

A-ha! We have more ideas.
Why not free bachelors Will
Terry’s and TCPZ’s homes for
student use and put them in the
2nd floor Watts triple along
with _coffee-you-can-count-on
Cora Nelson? Come to think of

it this would free Cora’s home

as well. I'm sure we could
sqtieeze 25 students in those 3
houses. Of course-this would
keep Watts 211 from student
use. But we’d net a+22 from
this arrangement. So far our
total comes to +36. We’re
getting somewhere.

We also have some on-cam-

’ pus solutions. 1) Eliminate all

home sports events and convert
the Wildcat Hilton into a dorm.
2) Make all the hallways on the
first floor of all dorms into
rooms. This would of course
cause all those living in the

ever take a religion or philoso-

phy class again...ergo...we use
the offices of the ex-profs as
rooms.

I think by now we've created
‘at least 100 new spots. But we
won’t stop here. We have our
own 1987 plan. This involves
detonating a neutron bomb at
next fall’s SPE cookout. Of |
course there'd be a fallout which
would contaminate the SPE
house for approximately six
years. This would be necessary
anyway for complete catharsis.

. Then_the house would be ready

for occupation by 1987. This
same plan of action could be
used at the ATO house. It is of
course critical that the bomb be
detonated with all members

' present so that there won’t be

anymore overcrowding on on

‘terson Court.

A little ingenuity and imagi-
nation mixed in with compas-

sion are all one needs to come up

with solutions to problems as
sticky ‘as those we've been
confronted with. Don’t worry
Bill, we're glad to help.
