THE DAVIDSONIAN

—Isaiah 9:6

The street lights have been hung,
the store windows decorated, and
the Santa Clauses have been hired.
The bicycles look a little redder,
the dolls a little prettier, the mer-
chants smile broadens with his
sales increases, and the sour-faced
clerk’s smile is a little more forced.
The children playing in the snow are
bragging about how much Santa
is going to bring them. Christmas
has been lost in a jumble of lights,
tinsel, advertizing slogans and the
jangling of bells—for the most part
cash register bells.

“Stop a moment, stranger, and
hearken, I am the spirit of Christ-
mas gifts—a symbol of the unself-
ishness which characterized God's
greatest gift to mankind nineteen
and a half centuries ago.

“You will never find me as a part
of the mink coat Mr. Brown gave
his wife because Mr. Jones was
giving Mrs. Jones muskrat. I get
lost when Harry rushes down to get
Joan “Evening in Paris’ because
Bill is giving her “Chenile No. 5.”
I am not given with the cigars
for the boss when the whole staff
wishes they were loaded. For
though they are called gifts, they
are not truly given.

“I am the gold, and franken-
scence and myrrh which the wise
men placed before the manger. I
am the two coins which Little Bro-
ther slipped into the altar plate,
and I was the spirit that rang those
chimes. I instill my being in the
roast turkey left on the poverty-
stricken door-step, and in the box
the scrubwoman packs for her way-
ward son in Joliet. I am in the for-
gotten gifts—those which were for-
gotten by the giver—asking no re-
compense and expecting none. I
am at home in the fruit filled stock-
ing of the janitor’s son, but in the
banker’s home there are so many
toys, that I would suffocate.”

“Be not afraid, stranger, for I
am not malicious. I may: shake
men’s self-centeredness to it’s
foundations, or deflate individual
egos, but my love is enough for all
of them. I must go now, stranger,
for there are many who truly give,
and their gifts must carry my bles-

sing. Adieu, and, peace be with],

you.”

The stranger stood’ for a_ mo-
ment, looking aroum him. He took
a sheaf of ‘bills from his billfold,
gazed at them thoughtfully, and
walked quickly down a side street
toward some shabby tenements,
Once on the street he stopped an
instant before each door. When
the brief visits were completed, he
stepped across the street, and as
soon as the first cry of joyous. sur-
prise sounded, he disappeared into
the night.

Willie, with a thirst for ‘gore,
Nailed the baby to the door.
Mother said, with humor quaint,
“Willie, dear, don't spoil the
paint.”
