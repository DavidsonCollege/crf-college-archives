With four seconds remaining
inthe game and Davidson clinging
toa 1-0 lead over the Furman Pala-
dins in the Southern Conference
men’s soccer final, Alex Deegan,
Davidson’s senior goalkeeper and
team captain, knew Brian
Nickerson, a junior mid-fielder for
Furman, would try to beat him to
his left. It didn’t work, and
Deegan’s diving save‘ on
Nickerson’s penalty kick sealed
the victory for the ‘Cats, propel-
ling them onto Bowling Green, the
Mid-American Conference cham-
pion, for an NCAA tournament
play-in game next weekend.

Ali the credit for that goes to
Matt Hill [a junior goalkeeper who
backs up Deegan]. He told me
which way he [Nickerson] was
going,” Deegan, who was named
to the all-tournament team and
voted most outstanding player,
said. “He [Nickerson] made a pen-
alty kick on Hill last year when I
was hurt, so 1 knew which way to
zo.”

Furman was awarded the pen-
alty kick after a Furman player fell
in the top corner of the penalty
area. Chad Lagerway, a junior de-
fender, went in fora tackle against
the opposing player, and was called
for the foul. Pete Boylan, a senior
defender who was close by the
play, said that Lagerway was just

playing hard, and 30 minutes ear-
lier it would have been a no call.

Charlie Slagle, the Davidson
coach, was also a bit baffled by the
play, saying: “I’m not exactly sure
what happened. I think the ref was
on more of an edge after our pen-
alty kick.”

Davidson’s goal had come 3
minutes before when Robert Clarke
converted a penalty kick to break a
scoreless tie in what was an evenly
played game throughout.

“We were fortunate to get the
penalty kick,” Nick Troiano, a se-
nior mid-fielder also named to the
all-tourney team, said. “But then
he made up for it [by giving Furman
a penalty on a questionable call].
When he gave it, we said my God,
it’s going to be tied, but then we
thought and said we have Deegan

in goal, and I was a little more

relaxed.”

Slagle echoed that praise of
Deegan saying: “If we had to make
one [a penalty kick] to win it, or
have him [Deegan] save one, I’d
almost rather have him saving it.”
And Phil Julien, a sophomore
striker, called Deegan the best
goalie he had ever seen for penalty
kicks.

Clarke’s goal was set-up when
Ryan Northington, a senior mid-
fielder, volleyed a ball that Furman
had cleared back into the penalty
area. Clarke perfectly timed aloop-
ing run through the Furman de-
fense and ended up with a one-on-
one opportunity against Furman
goalie Ronnie Pascale. He touched
the ball tohis right, beating Pascale,
and was taken down. Davidson
was awarded the penalty which

Cats strike back

For the women’s soccer team,
the revenge and motivation factors
really hit home Friday night at the
end-of-season conference tourna-
ment banquet, especially with
Furman being called to the podium
with the label of regular-season
conference champion.

WOMEN’S SOCCER

“To hear Furman being called
out as number one, that really got
to us,” senior forward Claudia
Lombard said. “If we could have
played right after that banquet, we
would have gone out and beaten
them 10-0. We were so mad. We
were so pumped up. We showed
them who’s the best today.”

. The score wasn’t quite 10-0,

but the 3-0 shutout the Wildcats
put on the Paladins to win the
Southern Conference tournament
title Sunday afternoon at
Richardson Field was all the re-
venge Davidson needed.

“Treally felt sorry for the other

teams, because we knew that we
would come out and kill them,”
senior defender Shannon Lowrance
said. :

The win was especially sweet
for Lombard, Lowrance and
Heather Wineberg, the three se-
niors who did so much in leading
the program to titles in the first two
Southern Conference women’s
tournaments this year and last.

And although Wineberg sat
out this weekend with an injured
knee, she was the one leading the
cheering on the sideline toward the
end of Sunday’s game, getting the
rest of the team on its feet to make
some noise.

Lombard scored three goals
during the weekend, one on Friday
and two in a 4-0 win over Georgia
Southern in earning her honor as
the tournament’s outstanding
player. Lowrance was the leader of
a defense that in four games and
390 minutes has still not allowed a
goal in tournament play.

“The good feeling about to-
day is that over the course of two
games this weekend we played up
to our potential ‘and showed how
good we could be,” coach Kevin
Hundley said. :

Aside from the obvious moti-

vation of playing for the tourna- .

‘ment title, the players all took spe-

cial interest and pride in beating
Furman and Georgia Southern, two
teams that perhaps the Wildcats
shouldn’t have lost to in the regu-
lar season.

On Oct. 11, Furman beat
Davidson 3-2 and the two teams

‘played to a 2-2 tie Oct. 24. And on

Oct. 21, Georgia Southern eked °
out a 2-1 win over the Wildcats. A
win in either of the Furman games
would have given Davidson the
regular-season title.

And so the entire 16-person
team came together this weekend
with only one intent. For these two
days, they would be the ones out to
knock off the regular-season
champs after being the defending
champion and the hunted all sea-
son long.

_ “Wehadeverything to lose all
season as the defending champi-
ons. Everyone would come out
extra hard and try to beat us,”
Lowrance said. “But coming into
this tournament, we were the un-
derdogs for a change and that took
a little of the pressure off. We
knew we still owned the title, we

just had to prove it to everyone
else.”
