Davidson

By SARAH TEACHWORTH
Staff Writer

In making plans for this year’s
Solidarity Week, Co-Curricular
Vice President of the Union Board
Jenny Everett searched for the vid-
eotaped recording of Davidson’s
first Solidarity Day, which took
place in April, 1986. William
Brown, the College Union Director

-and Coordinator of Student Activi-
ties, suggested that she call Steve
Davis ’87, who had recorded that
event. Davis, now the Vice Presi-
dent for Smith Barney Plan Ser-
vices, lives in the town of Davidson.
Everett never located the tape, but
she did convince Davis to make a
casual appearance at the CROP
Lunch last Thursday in the 900
Room of the Union.

When a significant number of
people had arrived to partake of the
weekly offering of rice, beans, and
cornbread, Davis spoke informally
to the group. In the spring of 1986,
word had gotten around that the Ku
Klux Klan had registered with the
town of Davidson to march down

alum narrates tale of first Solidarity

Main Street. It was to be one of a
few marches scheduled in the area.
Signs sprung up around town, an-
nouncing the event. In the words of
Rob Vaughn 86, who was the act-
ing Union Board President, “We
were angry; we were galvanized,
really, we were fighting mad.”

A group of conscientious stu-
dents, headed by Vaughn, SGA
President Mark Sandy ’86, and Pat
Millen ’86, began to brainstorm for
ways to peacefully demonstrate the
widespread opposition to the march.
Brownis proud of the fact that “they
didn’t work because of their elected
offices but because of their con-
sciences.” Davis, in turn, gives
much of the credit to Brown, who
he says, “was the person who trained
us to observe things happening and
react to them in the appropriate
way.”

After discarding a few ideas
that were deemed to be potentially
provocative, the students began
making plans to hold Davidson’s
first Solidarity Day on the day of
the march. Vaughn says that they
wanted to “gather, black and white,

in solidarity, support, and celebra-
tion.” With only a short amount of
time to plan, the organizers arranged
for several speakers to come and for
Bobby Houck of the Blue Dogs to
provide entertainment.

On the day of the march, most
of the Main Street shops closed
their doors. Students, staff, faculty,
and residents from both sides of the
tracks gathered behind Vail Com-
mons. Even the Soda Shop came to
provide sandwiches to the cel-
ebrants. Davis got misty-eyed as he
recalled the beauty of seeing big,
burly SAEs and PiKAs playing
hacky sack with little children from
the community. The weather was
fantastic and:everyone had a won-
derful time. “It was one of those
things you wish you could bottle
up,” he says.

Because he was the man with
the videocamera, he did remove
himself from the festivities to vid-
eotape the march on Main Street
from the seclusion of a balcony on
either Eu or Phi Hall. What he saw
surprised him. He had been pre-
pared for a scene similar to those in

the film “Mis-
,Sissippi Burn-
ing,” and in-
stead saw thirty

far as Davis
could see, there
were no spec-

tators. “It was
surreal,” he
says. “It was

like you could
hear the birds chirping and you
thought ‘Why are these people
here?’ It was pathetic.” One of the
demonstrators even got arrested for
carrying a concealed weapon.
After Davis’ talk, students dis-
cussed what they had heard. There

seemed to be a consensus that there
should be more publicity about the
origins of Solidarity Week. Jenny
Nolan ’99 said, “I think it’s amaz-
ing that Solidarity Week exists and
I think it’s too bad that more people
don’t know why we have it.”

Chao issues service through leadership as national goal

By NarEsH NAGELLA —

On Tuesday night Davidson
students gained first hand insight to

the value of service and strong lead-
ership from Elaine Chao, a leader
of many public and private chari-
table organizations throughout her
career.

Chao gave a speech called
“Leadership Making a World of
Difference” as a featured speaker
during Solidarity Week in Love
Auditorium.

She began her talk by building
a personal and historical founda-
tion for her call to serve through
leadership.

“One of the best aspects of our

country is our generosity, tradition, ~

and spirit for giving. Volunteerism
is a hallmark of this country,” she
says.

She began with an account of
her family’s journey from Taiwan
to America.

Her parents met on a boat that
was blocked from returning to port
during the Communist takeover of
China. The boat eventually joined
others that went to Taiwan.

Eventually, her father emi-
grated to America before the rest of
Chao's family and worked to save
enough money to pay the family’s
passage on a cargo boat three years
later.

Emily Smith
Freshman Zaidee Rose and Senior Dan Mojonnier listen to advice on
service through leadership from Elaine Chao on Tuesday.

She arrived in America at the
age of eight and did not know the
language.

She praises the support of all
her neighbors in Queens who helped
her and her family assimilate into
their new country.

“Tt was around this time that I
noticed how giving and kind our
country can be. We must continue
this help to keep the immigrant
dream alive,” Chao says.

After graduating from Mount
Holyoke college and Harvard busi-
ness school, Chao became a White
House fellow in the Reagan Admin-
istration.

She ascended through the ex-
ecutive department, becoming an
Assistant Secretary of Transporta-
tion and Director of the Peace Corps.

She lists dealing with the clean-
up of the Exxon Valdez oil spill and
trying to incorporate peace corps
volunteers into rapidly democratiz-
ing Eastern European countries as
her biggest challenges.

. She cites the thousands of vol-
unteers that tried to clean up the
spill and offered to serve in Eastern
Europe as evidence of the Ameri-
can impulse and spirit to help.

From here, Chao went on to
become the President of United

“T never planned or chose my
intended career path. It was more
like a ‘fate’ or ‘destiny.’ [just wanted
to be a part of a solution,’ Chao
says.

Chao was instrumental in turn-
ing around United Way. Under her
tenure, the organization regained
much of its lost respect and even
took in 5% more than expected con-
tributions.

Chao says she learned much of
what it takes to be a good leader
here.

“T tried to form a shared vision,
core values, mission, and challenges

for all members of the organization.
The ability to build bridges is most
important. Inspiring leaders, talk-
ing, and, listening to people is im-

“The best way to use power is
not to show but to give it out [to
employees]. You must posses a
sense of compassion and have re-
spect for the people who work with
you,” she believes...

She concludes by saying,
“People can do something interest-
ing just by getting out of bed and
contributing.” :

~ “Towhommuchis given, much

is required” is her basis for calling
people to service.

Chao is married to Senator
