Coordination for Religious Program

Yesterday, afternoon the College an-
nounced that Dr. George E. Staples of

Winston-Salem has accepted the newly-¥

created post of Minister to Students at

Davidson. t

The import of this announcement is
that it potentially ‘is the most significant
move involving campus religious life in
some years.

There has long been a.crying need for
a competent and dedicated man to fill
such a position: as this from all reports
will be.

While religious emphasis has been a
guiding principle throughout the history
of the college. the program with its nu-
merous and diverse components has al-
ways been more or less disjointed.

Complete coordination. of religious af-
fairs has never been channeled through
one single individual or office.

The administration has traditionally
assumed responsibility in some areas The
YMCA, the College Church. and the
various denominational groups have pre-
dominated in others.

Overlapping of efforts has resulted.
Almost as often there have been conspic-
uous gaps in the program.

Now, with one capable man at the ad-
ministrative helm of all religious affairs
of the College, all elements involved
should increase in their potency, as they
contribute to a more purposeful, inte-
grated program.

However, even when administratively
effective, the religious program in the
past has consistently fallen down in the
most vital and basic realm of all: that of
personal attention to the individual re-

ligious life of the students.

The four-year college experience is
the most maturing, formative period in
many young men’s lives. More often than
not, college offers a rugged testing
ground for the faith which a freshman
brings with him from home.

’ Skepticism is often confronted for the
first time. For many, classroom studies
give rise to thoroughgoing doubts.

The compulsory element in religion
at Davidson is often misinterpreted, due
not infrequently to failure to speak di-
rectly with effectiveness and force to
student needs.

The Minister to Students will attempt |
to balance these factors of intellectual and
spiritual maturation which for some lead
to hard-shelled cynicism. He will serve as
a pastoral counselor and as an advisor to
student individuals and organizations on
an informal as well as formal basis.

An essential quality in the man who
will fill this post is that he will be re-
garded as a man’s man, who vigorously
lives his faith without apology or timidity.
To be effective, this man must command
respect without reservation from all seg-
ments which make up the college.

Davidson has been extremely fortu-
nate in securing a pastor, counselor and
administrator of the caliber of Dr.
Staples. His record speaks for itself. .

He seems to well fulfill the rigorous
and highly exacting specifications inher-
ent in the nature of the job.

At Davidson. Dr. Staples will find a
college community long thirsting for the
type of service which he can render. The
opportunities are limitless.

Vesper Speakers Must Be Called Now

With less than two weeks of classes
left in the 1955-56 school year, plans are
now being made, or at least should be,
for the one hundred twenty-first session
of Davidson College in 1956-57.

With that in mind, it is hoped that the
Religious Exercises Committee of the
faculty, with its new student member, will
not overlook its duty.

This.is the committee responsible for
selecting the men who speak to us each
Sunday night in Vespers.

One of the original purposes of Ves-
pers was to bring to the college campus
the most prominent preachers in the
country; men who could inspire the stu-
dent body with a rich, meaningful Chris-
tian message.

By bringing the top men from all over
the country to Vespers, students would be
able to hear the messages of men, whom,
under ordinary conditions, they might
never have the opportunity to hear.

Unfortunately, in recent years, this
purpose of Vespers seems to have been
overlooked. Out of the fourteen speakers
scheduled for the first semester, nine
were from North Carolina; and seven of
these nine were from Charlotte or David-
son.

Again for the second semester, nine
of the fourteen speakers were from North
Carolina.

This is not meant to question the right
or the honor of these men to speak at
Vespers. Yet the fact remains that if one
of the purposes of Vespers is to bring the
most prominent men from all over the
country to speak, this purpose is being
defeated.

Anyone who sincerely wants to hear
these men from nearby churches needs
only to get up an hour or so early on
Sunday morning and drive a few miles.

If Vespers is to remain a required

exercise, the Davidson student body has
a right to demand the highest quality of
sermons, which, with a few notable ex-
ceptions, has not been the case this year.

In order to secure the type of speak-
ers desired, it will be necessary to invite
them, not just a few weeks in advance,
but several months ahead of time. In the
case of the Vesper schedule for first se-
mester this year, there were at least three
changes in speakers after the schedule
was printed in the bulletin.

It is hoped that the Religious Exercises
Committee will make an effort to obtain
suggestions for speakers from interested
members of the student body; that these
suggestions will be carefully considered
by the committee, and that invitations to
speak will be sent out immediately in or-
der that the desired speakers may be ob-
tained.

Then, and only then, may Vespers be-
come the rich spiritual experience it
should be. A.WF.B.

Einstein on Books

The other night on television, we
heard Einstein quoted as not knowing the
speed of light.

When asked why, the late genius re-
plied: “One should never clutter one’s
mind with things which can be found in a
book.” Then the interviewer said: “Then
you don't believe in a college education?”
To which Einstein said: “But yes, I do.
College should train one to use the mind
to handle and to analyse problems not
found in any book.”

To pose a question for thought: how
many of us can say we are ‘educated’ in
this sense?

Crimson-White, Univ, of Alabama

Reprinted below are ex-
cerpts from an open letter on
the enrollment issue to the
Board of Trustees of the Col-
lege.

The letter originated from
a committee of four interest-
ed graduating seniors: Perrin
Anderson, Joe Conarroe, Pat
Miller, and Clyde Robinson.

Subsequently endorsed by
the 1955-56 Student Council,

the statement was mailed
this past week to the
trustees.

Lee We believe that Davidson
-fs a leader in education in com-
parison with other church-related
schools and to other Southern
schools. However, to be doing her
job and fulfilling her purpose she
must compare favorably with the

best secular schools in the entire
nation.

If she does compare favorably
and can continue to do so with an
increase in enrollment, then we
feel that there. is no reason why
she should not open her doors-to
1000 students. Let us make
such a comparison in three im-

ENDORSED BY STUDENT COUNCIL

Letter to Trustees Asks Enrollment Reconsideration

here through such a rigorous pro-
cess of selection as we are some-
times led to believe.

For instance, there were 603
applications for admission to this
year’s freshman class. Of these,
263 were accepted. 145 withdrew,
and 142 were rejected. The rest
were placed on the waiting list
and’ ultimately withdrew. Wes-
leyan University (Connecticut),
enrollment 819, turned down 1300
last year.

Another indication of the com-
paratively lower learning poten-
tial of the Davidson student may
be found in an analysis of College
Board scores. The score for the
middle man in our freshman class
was 479 verbal and 530 mathema-
tical. The average scores for en-
tering freshmen at schools com-
parable in size and purpose to
Davidson were:

‘verbal Math
Union 509 581
Dartmouth §37.5 567.8
Wesleyan (Conn.) 576 596
Amherst 583 625

Thus it seems evident that in
the first element necessary to Da-
vidson's fulfilling her function
and purpose, she does not
measure up to the best secular
institutions of the nation.

In turning our attention to the
all important question of the
faculty, the men who are leading
the Davidson student in his quest
for an education, we Jiscovered
that we are lagging behind the
leading small colleges of the
nation in student-faculty ratio.

Kenyon College, with an en-
rollment of 440, has 49 profes-
sors for a ratio of one faculty
member to every 9 students; Am-
herst, enrollment 1050, has 120
faculty members for a ratio of
1 to 8.7; Williams, with 1075 in
the student body and 128 pro-
fessors, has a faculty-student ratio
of 1 to 84; and Haverford, a
school of 482 students and 86
faculty members, is blessed with
a ratio of 1 to 5.6.

Compared to these schools,
Davidson, enrollment ¢c. 865 and
faculty of 65, brings up the rear
with a ratio of 1 to 13.3. If the
enrollment is increased to 1000,
this fairly respectable ratio will

YMCA OUTLOOK

By GORDON BONDURANT
President Of YMCA

As the YMCA begins to formu-
late its plans for an effective and
inclusive program for 1956-57, it
behooves the members and non-
members of the “Y" to investi-
gate certain pertinent questions.

What is to be gained by
my participation in the
YMCA? There are many rea-
sons why one might join the
"¥"". | should like to discuss
a few.

First. the YMCA intends to in-
corporate in its program activities
which should be of vital interest
and concern to everyone, and the
“y" shall offer undertakings
which will need the support of all
interest groups.

The YMCA must fulfill the
spiritual needs of the David-
son student, for this is the
prime concern the “VY” has
in considering and planning
its program.

Let us not deceive ourselves by
saying that our spiritual needs
are met in Vespers, Chapel and
the Bible courses, for often they
only serve to indicate the poverty
of our Christian faith. It is there-
fore the purpose of the “Y” to
provide other mediums of expres-
sion by which we may strengthen
our witness and unite our lives
to God.

There will be many areas
through which opportunities
for study, discussion, and rec-
reation can and will be pro-
moted. With the coming of
the Presidential election there
will be further political
forums. Also non-varsity, in-
tercollegiate athletic events
will offer an excellent outlet
for others who desire this
kind of activity. Opportuni-
ties will be given for men to
work with other people in the
Davidson community and the
surrounding area.

But most of all it is hoped that
the “Y" will provide occasions
when students can broaden their
interest and become concerned
about the problems which face
us in the world at large and
matters which are of concern for

our Campus alone. In this manner
the “Y"” can contribute to our
Spiritual needs and provide chan.
nels through which we can intel-
ligently express our Christian con-
cern on any issue and from various
positions and opinions.

Secondly, 1! would like to
ask when you consider
whether or not to join the
“¥" next year, do not do so
because someone else does,
but because: you believe that
the YMCA needs you and that
you benefit from it.

This does not only include your
financial support, but also your
suggestions, your energies, and
your moral support by just being
a member. The “Y” can use you,
and it very definitely needs you.

The recently-arrived Associated
Collegiate Press’ official guide
book, which judges the David-
sonian against nation-wide compe-
tition, posed this question in its
wrap-up of our News coverage:

“Anything odd, unusual, or
violent ever happen to any-
bedy on campus?”

No sir, don’t believe so... . .
Anyone for a little newsworthy
mayhem?

Home-grown bloopers were
plentiful at Tuesday’s ROTC Field
Day. While radio men in the field
screamed for contestants in the
“best-dressed” squad to report for
judging, the P.A. system boomed
instructions for all participants in
the tug of war to “please remain
in the stands” during the event.

Editor Emeritus Morehead, re-
leased from the burdens of office,
left the new staff with this mag-
nanimous morale booster as he
checked out:

“If I can be of any assistance
later on, don't fail to look me
up. I'll either be at the river, on
the tennis courts, or in the sack.”

He wasn’t kidding. ... .

soar to a ratio of 1 to 16.3..

In order to discover how the
qualifications of our faculty rate
in comparison with the qualifi-
cations of the faculties of these
other highly rated small colleges,
we investigated the number of
men holding Ph. D.’s, the symbol
of.a teacher’s mastery of his field,
at the several schools. At Haver-
ford there are 57 Ph. D.’s, at
Kenyon 30, at Aniherst 70, at
Williams 71, and at Davidson 27. .

Lee el The quality of instruc-
tion which a college can offer is
intimately associated with her
library, Wesleyan University,
Swarthmore. Hamilton, Union,
Reed and Haverford, all with less
than 1000 students, have libraries
of more than 400,000; 162,000; 221,
000; 140,000; 95,000; and 196,
000 volumes respectively. David-
son's library contains somewhat
more than 65,000 volumes, com-
parable to Maryville, 55,000; Elon,
40.000: and Gettysburg, 65,000. . .

LETTERS TO EDITOR

vious. Davidson is not doing her
job now when her endowment and
other income are being poured in-
to the educational necessities of
865 men. She is not now able to
attract the best students because
she lacks scholarship funds and
has an insufficient academic repu-
tation; she cannot now demand
the best professors because some
schools pay nearly twice her
salary scale; her library has too
few volumes; and consequently
her educational process is not
now operating at the high level
it should be.

Expansion would be expensive
for Chambers is the only building
which could accommodate the ad-
ditional students. There is dormi-
tory space for 825 students only.
The church, counting the choir,
is filled by 1042 people; and
should the enrollment be in-
creased, would not allow attend-
ance of townspeople and dates at
Vespers.

Science laboratories are over.

crowded now, and the library needs
to be enlarged for present use.
The fraternity houses, built for
forty men, are now being used by
seventy.

We, therefore, can see in an
increase in enrollment at this
time only a general lowering of
‘this present level of education, a
distribution of poorer education
to more people, under crowed
conditions.

The question now becomes what
should we do, and the answer
is obvious. We must pour every
penny we can into the endowment
in an effort to secure superior
students, faculty, and instruction
so that Davidson may someday
soon begin doing her duty to the
Church and to the South.

There is little doubt that David.
son, being where it is, and pos-
sessing the resources which it
does, has a tremendous opportu.
nity to become a truly significant
educational institution. .. .

Scripts ’n Pranks Has Lost its
Traditional Humor and Vitality

Dear Editor:

Two weeks ago another issue of
Scripts 'n Pranks showed up. And
quite frankly, I was pretty dis-
appointed with the magazine I
had hoped for (yet hardly ex-
pected) one really exciting issue
this year; but this one, just like
the others for the past three
years, generated absolutely
nothing.

There was no sparkle, no origi-
nality, no overall appeal. I found
it tiresome poring through the
horrors, sex, and whiskey, and
over the totally uninspired lay-
out. In one word, the magazine
was mediocre.

Perhaps Scripts 'n Pranks is
just a victim of the antienthu-
siasm attitude that pervades our
campus these days. As was said
in chapel recently, a student is
ridiculed by his fellows if he
shows signs of the least bit “gung-
ho” in anything whether it be
educational, intellectual, religi-
ous, or even prankish.

I get the impression that the
Scripts 'n Pranks staff publishes
the magazine more or less as a
necessary evil, that no enthusi-
astic effort is made to give the
reader a unique and enjoyable
book.

Davidson expects and deserves
more than an organ of medio-
crity. To give its readers some-
thing really worthwhile, Scripts
‘n Pranks must come out of its
slump. The editors must generate
some new enthusiam for the book
and must prevent good writers
with good ideas from slipping in-
to this conformity to mediocrity.

I hope that Scripts ’n Pranks
will continue to develop along
the lines of Eastern excellence
and sophisticated college wit
rather than bawdy Southern uni-
versity humor, and that it will

keep within the bounds of good
taste and dignity rather than at-
tempt to impress the reader with
the editors’ ability to remain just
on the fringes of Davidson de-
corum. Let Nugget and Escapade
satisfy the college man's longing
for printed vulgarities.

Here then is a request to next
year’s editorial staff for a top-

notch, quality college magazine -

that will provide the Davidson
student with a little entertain-
ment and pride.

N.Y. Answer to

Southern Views

Dear Sir:

The recent popularly requested
printing of Dr. C. K. Brown’s ad-
dress to the students of Davidson
College on March 1 has just pene-
trated that benighted land north
of the Rocky River.

It has caused a variety of re-
actions ranging from hilarity to
grim disagreement but most often
utter incredulity.

.. Dr. Brown observes that the
Negro cannot but adopt the white
man’s culture but yet is not en-
titled to claim it as his own for
“the Pilgrim fathers can never be
his fathers; the signers of the
Declaration can never be his an-
cestors.”

Nor can those who have
escaped Eastern Europe in the
1950’s, Germany in the ‘30's, the
Balkan wars of the early
tweptieth century.

Nor can the sons of those who
fled revolutions in central and
southern Europe in 1848, nor the
famines in Ireland in the 1840's,

nor Scandanavia in the ’80’s.

. . .Of course, if mere residence
on American soil is the basis for
judgement, and 1619 the year,
Pilgrim descendants would be ex-
cluded while those of Negro
slaves in Virginia would be en-
dowed with civil rights and social
station.

Having been responsible for
bringing the Negro to this coun.
try, is the white man now to deny
him the benefits or curses of his
civilization because he (the Ne-
gro) was not expropriated from
his home sooner?

Dr. Brown continues to decry
that the world partakes of the
material accoutrements of our
civilization but does not indicate
that it “understands or respects. .
anything that lies back of our
economic productivity.”

If “the world” may be seen to
include Negroes at home, who
have adopted the superficialities
of modern technological society
(viz. Cadillac cars lining unpaved
streets of urban Negro sections
and television antennae piercing
the air waves above unplumbed
Negro shanties), how does Dr.
Brown expect them to “under-
stand and respect” this white
civilization if his education js
relegated to ebony-pure schools?

Having spent two years at Da-
vidson, this writer cannot believe
that the faculty, administration,
or student body condones such
antique social tenets as advocated
by the “Southern (?) Position with
Respect to the Bi-Racial System.”

Can Davidson so soon have been
subverted to the Abolitionist
absurdity promulgated by the
Economics Department of the Col-
lege: “Ship the Negroes back to
Africa!"? -
