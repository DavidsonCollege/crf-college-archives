CORNWELL INSPIRES CAMPUS NONENTITIES
“A Nobody Is A Real Achievement”

Who’s Nothing Salutes

Noted Underachievers

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

The air was full of expectancy. Bedecking the podium was an emblem equal
to the solemnity of the occasion. The annual tapping for one of Davidson’s more
prestigious honoraries, which claims several fraternity presidents, an editor of THE
DAVIDSONIAN, and a grade-point average above that of the all men’s, was about to

commence.

After the members had
silently, and ‘with great dig-
nity, filed onto the stage,
presiding member Jim Full-
er rapped the podium with
his gavel, made from a beer
can, and the ceremony of
the local chapter of Who's
Nothing began.

Dibble introduced the key-note
speaker, Charlie Cornwell, by
presenting his accomplishments
in life, such as editor of Seripts
‘n Pranks, and his current posi-
tion as a member of the David-
son English Department.

“You see,"’ said Dibble, “‘we
could not have made a more
excellent choice, for what’s more
worthless than an editor of
Seripts ‘n Pranks or a member
of the Davidson English Depart-
ment."

Cornwell responded to the oc-
casion by talking for a few
minutes about absolutely noth-
ing. “Davidson should be hon-
ored,”’ he quipped, ‘to have the

only student body in the United
States in the past ten years to
demonstrate for the status quo.”’

Cornwell ended by stating that
“being a nobody at Davidson is
a real achievement.’ No one.
‘he said, can be a nobody and

succeed at anything. ‘‘Today’s.

nobody is tomorrow's ‘if.’ "
Then began the tapping cere-
mony, as each member ranged
through the audience to find the
honored ones. SAE George Brew-
er was caught completely un-
aware by roomie Tony McNay,
and went forward to receive his

key.
The others soon followed: Alex
Bernhardt, Fred Hetzel, Rat

Curry, and Phil Hightower of
the Kappa Sigs: Bill Schutt,
Bill Wood. Tom Cobb, and Jim
Wallace of the Betas; Jim Over-
ton of the Pikas: Warren Reid,
an ATO: Tommy Hunter from
the KA‘s: Vance Taylor of the
Phi Delts; Independent Chum
Roberts: the Phi Gams’ Joe

Clyde Gamble: Bill Daisy of
the Pi Kapps; Bob Strayser
from the SPE's: Alex” Wyatt,
and Charlie Goodykoontz, the
second sophomore to be tapped

He began with a very
rief opening statement
about the trustees’ position
on fraternities. According
to Martin, ‘They gave more
serious thought to this mat-
ter than anything they've
considered for some time.”

“It is our intention,”’ he con-
tinued,, “to carry out the pro-
visions which they have indicat-
ed — including the construction
of houses if there is sufficient
indication that they would be
desired and used,’ He also men-
tioned that a student group had
approached the administration
requesting the construction of
such houses and that studies as
to cost and location are under-
way.

The first topic was that of
the trustees and their view of
fraternities. Martin assured his

CHANGES POSSIBLE

Council Discusses Cars

By FRANK FLEMING
Davidsonian Staff Writer
Student Council discussed

at its Monday meeting the
possibility of assuming the
entire control and operation
of the Traffic Committee
for next year.

David Powell, the retiring
committee representative from
the Council, reported the results
of his meeting with Dean of

Trustees Action Reveal
Split Campus Opinion

Reactions to the action of
the Board of Trustees last
week concerning the fra-
ternity situation on campus
varied from favorable to
unfavorable.

The Trustees advised the fa-
culty to reconsider its stand on
rush for the coming year along
with support of the proposed
construction of two eating clubs.
The Trustees asked the faculty
to approve a deferred rush pro-
gram which would allow pledg-
ing for the class of 1969 next
year. The action was contrary
to the decision of the faculty to
place a moratorium on rush for
the coming academic year.

McGAVOCK REPORT

The Trustees’ action, as was
pointed out by immediate past
president of the IFC, Fred Sac-
kett, gave its approval to the
essentials of the McGavock
faculty committee report. This
report included provisions for
deferred rush, construction of
necessary eating clubs, a social
council, freshmen eating in the
College Union for the entire year
and revamped freshman activ-
ities.

Sackett stated that he was
“pleased” with the decision of
the Trustees because of its sup-
port for the McGavock report
which he so strongly favored. He
does not feel that deferred rush
will in any way jeopardize the
eating clubs and that there will
probably be greater disaffilia-
tion from the fraternities under
the proposed plan since the sys-
tem is no longer in any danger
from lack of membership.

Assistant Dean of Students
Robert G, Jones is of the opin-
jon that the action of the Trus-
tees is “a patchwork solution”
and that it is the result of a
failure to face the real issues.
He feels that the financial prob-

lems involved in the implemen-
tation of the proposal will be
very difficult to solve.

TERRY

Jim Terry, president of the
IFC, stated that ‘‘we're certain-
ly glad to have it’ (the proposal
of the Trustees). Terry com-
mented on the fact that the
duties of the IFC wuold be con-
siderably increased especially
since it ‘‘will assume the re-
sponsibility of informing incom-
ing freshmen about fraternities
on campus, rush, ete.”

Charles Dibble. immediate
past editor of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN, feels that the step taken

by the Trustees ‘is delaying the
inevitable,” a change in the
status of fraternities on campus.
He said that although he endors-
ed the action taken by the Trus-
tees in November “it took me
four months to realize that this
action would not meet the real
problem.”

Ed Haselden, immediate past
president of Beta Theta Pi and
supporter of the status quo,
stated that he felt the Trustees’
action is probably the best solu-
tion under the circumstances.”
Haselden expressed the hope
that under the proposal the eat-
Ing clubs would be a success.

Students Riehard C. Burts and
Asst. Dean of Students Robert
G. Jones. The purpose of the
report and ensuing discussion
was to provide an indication of
council opinion.
RESPONSIBILITY

Although many of the things
discussed were tentative, Powell
did point out, “The Faculty
Traffic Committee seems to
favor more Student Council re-
sponsibility in the area of traf-
fic control.”

The most obvious advantage
of council control would be a

monetary one. For example, the’

income this year from the sale
of parking stickers and pay-
ment of traffic tickets was ap-
proximately $700.

Since the council would ap-
parently receive all: traffic re-
venues, the question arose as to
whether or not the present $1,000
council. allowance would be re-
duced. That is, would the coun-
cil have both its allowance (pos-
sibly more than $1,000 next year)
and the traffic income?

Since no one knew the answer
to this question, the matter was
referred to Powell who will meet
with Burts and Jones.

NEW POLICIES

Powell explained that since
incoming freshmen will be al-
lowed to keep automobiles on
campus next semester, several

body had given careful conside-
ration to the question and that
their decision was no hasty one.

Asked about plans for the fu-
ture he said, ‘‘They were not
thinking in those terms at all.
If this proposal were to fail I
don’t know what they might do.”
He admitted, “You're taking
your life in your hands when
you try to predict what trus-
tees will do.”

On the subject of the faculty
oath Martin had a sharp ex-
change with one student who felt
that the change advocated by
the trustees had accomplished
little. Martin firmly insisted that
“the crucial point has not been
whether to have .Christians on
the faculty’’ but how to deter-
mine whether they are Chris-
tians. ‘‘We make no excuse for
requiring anyone who is a teach-
er here to be a Christian.”

new policies will be instituted.
The tentative plan will 1imit
freshmen parking to the areas
behind Johnston Gymnasium
and across the street from the
Fine Arts. Quadrangle.

Different colored parking
stickers will be issued to fresh-
men. According to Powell, Jones
has designed a “‘pretty new
style’ for the ‘65-'66 stickers,
with Davidson spelled out in
big letters. Such a device will
thus‘ serve to publicize the col-
lege.

REGULAR BUSINESS

The regular business then be-
gan with the election of Irving
Welling as treasurer for the
newly-organized Social Council.
Following his nomination by
Randy McKnight, he was ac-
cepted by acclamation. Welling
currently serves as treasurer of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and as
business manager of THE
DAVIDSONIAN.

Fred Sackett brought up the
problem of whether or not in-
coming freshmen would eat at
the College Union all year. If
so, then the fraternities would
still have some problem of fi-
nances.

He then explained a possible
system of “farming out’’ first
semester freshmen to the fra-
ternities. By allotting six . or
eight ‘new boarders,” the

OPINION

VARIES.

Faculty Views Change In Oath

Faculty and administra-
tion members were general-
ly pleased with the action
taken by the trustees to-
ward abolishing the faculty
oath and replacing it with
the requirement that pro-
spective permanent faculty
members satisfy the admin-
istration and trustees.

At their meeting last Friday
the trustees proposed that the
administration certify to the
Trustees Education Committee
that each person recommended
for tenure:

(1) Be committed to the Chris-
tian faith and be a member of
a Christian church and,

(2) Comprehend the Statement
of Purpose of Davidson College
and intend to promote this pur-
pose.

REPLACEMENT

This statement replaced the

proposal which was passed last

October and needs only a sec-
ond reading for final approval.
Under the old proposal all pro-
spective faculty members would
have had to affirm in writing
a series of five questions deal-
ing with their belief in the teach-
ings of. evangelical Christianity.

Frontis W. Johnston, dean of
the faculty. stated that either
he or President D. Grier Mar-
tin would certify a professor to
the trustees.

When asked how he would go
about certifying an individual,
he replied, ‘‘I would certainly
talk to him, but I have no de-
tailed procedure. This statement
gives me a certain flexibility.”

Personally in favor of. the new
proposal, Johnston stated, “We
and the trustees want the same
kind of faculty. Before this we
went about getting it in differ-
ent ways, they with formal
vows, we with private conserva-
tions. This is an agreement in

goals and not in method. Just as
the administration determines
the academic qualifications of
an individual, we shall now
certify his Christian commit-
ment."
GRATITUDE

Johnston was emphatic on one
point: that of expressing the
gratitude of the administration
and faculty ‘‘for the statesman-
like attempt on the part of the
trustees to see our point of view.
They have leaned over back-
wards to do something they real-
ly didn't want to do as individ-
uals. But they wanted to serve
the best interests of the college."

Associate Professor of Eco-
nomics E. F. Patterson, who
was “unalterably opposed" to
the October proposal, hailed the
new action as ‘‘an excellent step
in the right direction toward
removing ail religious restric-
tions’ on the hiring of faculty
members.

In regard to the general effect
of the decision, Patterson said,
“This will improve the image of
Davidson in the eyes of profes-
sional teachers, the academic
profession in general, and bet-
ter-thinking elements in the
public.”

IN BETWEEN

Citing the Danforth study,
which considered 817 church-re-
lated educational institutions in
the country, Dr. D. D. Rhodes
added, *‘Many Christian colleges
lose strength and identity by too
much secularization. Of course,
some are too fundamentalistic.
The answer is in between. This
is where Davidson wants to
stand.”

G. L. Abernethy, philosophy
professor, was ‘‘very happy”
with the ‘intelligent action.”
He stated that he had been op-
posed to the vow for a number
of years, ‘though I took it some
17 years ago.”

The movement to strike the
drinking rule from the student
body regulations was also taken
up. Martin would not definitely
predict the faculty reaction, but
he did indicate that he was
against a radical change and
that if the faculty regulation
were not changed it would be
enforced.

He added that the rule allow-
ing liquor in car trunks was
passed ‘‘not more than four or
five months ago with the defin-
ite understanding that this would
enable the Student Council and
Honor Court to enforce the re-
maining rule."

twelve fraternities could lighten
their financial strain. Such a
system would also serve to unify
the entire student body and to
make the incoming students feel
more ‘‘at home.”

Discussion ended without any
action being taken. Chuck Mat-

Faculty Broadens
Vespers Attendance

The faculty ruled yesterday that, beginning
next year, students of the Roman Catholic and Jew-
ish faiths may substitute worship at specified cathe-
drals and synagogues for Sunday vespers attendance.

It also directed the Committee on Fraternities
and Social Life to implement the decision on frater-
nities reached here by the Trustees last week.

Selection of a place of worship outside Davidson
will be left to the individual Roman Catholic or Jew-
ish student. “We think each student should pick
what would be a ‘home church’,” said Richard C.

Once that choice has been made, the. student
may substitute worship there for Sunday evening
worship at the college vespers service. But these two
places will be the only places where attendance will
satisfy the vespers requirement for the students af-
fected (aside from attendance at any of the Davidson

This ruling left out a minority comprised of
Roman Catholics and Jews, occasioning this week’s
decision. Dean of the Faculty Frontis W. Johnston
said that the faculty plans to keep in mind other
general changes, but expects none at present.

The Committee on Fraternities and Social Life,
directed by the faculty to work out the details by
which the faculty can conform to the recommenda-
tions of the Trustees, is expected to produce no nov-

The faculty did not deal with the possible es-
tablishment of an eating club, which has been a ma-
jor facet of most recommendations regarding the fu-
ture of social life at Davidson. This measure was
delegated by the Trustees to the administration for
further study, and faculty action on it was not called

Also during its meeting, the faculty received a
Curriculuin Committee report recommending that a
new course in German civilization be added to next
year’s German department course offerings.

It also approved a rewording of the language re-

but eliminated its ambiguity.

No mention was made during the meeting of

removal of the drinking clause from the Student

Amendment Strikes

lAt Restrictions

Arnie Goodstein presented to the Student Council
Monday his petition signed by about 300 students calling
for an amendment abolishing the drinking clause in the
student body constitution. David Powell’s motion to en-
dorse the petition was tabled until the next meeting.

According to Article IX of
the constitution, a proposed
amendment must be voted
on by the students within
ten days after its presenta-
tion to the council.

This referendum will take
place on Wednesday or Thurs-
day following assembly Wednes-
day morning in which the ques-
tion will be discussed. A two-
thirds vote is necessary for pas-
sage.

TAKE STAND

“IT come (to the meeting),”
Goodstein told the council, ‘‘not
only to -bring the petition, but
to ask the Student Council to
take a stand on this issue. It is
important; I feel it is time for
you to go one way or another.”

He reaffirmed that the main
reason he wishes to abolish the
rule forbidding drinking and
possession of alcohol on campus
is that Student Council and Hon-
or Court members are ‘honor
bound” to enforce it while the
rest of the students’are not.

“If you feel it is wrong.” he
said, .“then state it.’ Pointing
out that council members are
as involved with this rule as he
(an Honor Court member) is,
he asked the council to become
“conspirators with me" in op-
posing the rule.

JACKSON

President Bill Council asked
seniors Fred Sackett and Will
Jackson to comment. Jackson
said he didn‘t believe the drink-
ing rule should be abolished
simply because student officials
don't want to be “honor bound"
to report drinking.

He said that a change in the

oath of office, which requires
student officials to report vio-
lators of the drinking clause,
would be more appropriate.
“This vote should not,’’ he con-
cluded, “be on the basis of the
honor condition. It should be
based on whether or not they
(the students) are in favor of a
wet campus.”

SACKETT

Sackett stated he believed that
most students want a dry cam-
pus, and that last fall's ‘trunk
rule"’ sufficiently alleviates the
student’s problems. ‘‘I think the
referendum," he continued.
“would be a good measure of
student opinion, however."

David Walker questioned Sac-
kett’s view that the students
want a dry campus, and express-
ed his belief that the petition is
right in calling the rule ‘‘anach-
ronistic.”*

CONTROL SELVES
Goodstein jsaid he believed
most students don’t want a dry
campus. “I think the Davidson

students are honorable enough.”’ :

he commented, ‘‘to control
themselves, whether they have
liquor here or at Hattie’s. I
think the attitude around here
is toward change.”

Powell and First Vice-Presi-
dent Johnny Gresham agreed.
“The trustees,"’ explained Gres-
ham, “‘should have an idea of
student opinion.”

Jackson pointed out that in
1958 the rule as it now stands
was put into the constitution
by students ‘‘no less mature or
responsible than us.”

“I think we ought to be for

or against a wet or dry camp- -

us,’ John Fagg commented. He
said he thought that if one phase
of the honor system (that hon-
or court and council members
are “honor bound" to report
drinking) could be ignored long
enough to be eyentually abolish-
ed, then the whole honor sys-
tem could be abolished.

SEPARATE

Goodstein said he believed the
honor system and the student
body constitution are somewhat
separate. ‘‘We are honor bound
on this issue,"’ he explained.
“They (the other students) are
only ‘duty bound’.”’

Jackson then reiterated a
previous point. “If this is a
problem concerning a strain on
the honor system,” he said,
“correct it in the proper man-
ner. If you don't want to be
‘honor bound’ to report viola-
tions, then change the oath so
you won't be ‘honor bound.’

“If necessary, wipe it out be-
cause the students are against
the rule, not because 30 students
stagger around campus under
this honor responsibility.”

HYPOCRITICAL

Powell commenied. ‘It's hypo-
critical to have a rule which we

bend over backward to avoid.” .

Council then stated his posi-
tion which, as he later sum-
marized it, is this: ‘‘We are still
trying to define the real issue,
In trying to understand it, we
must be as informed as possible
of all consequences of the pro-
posed change. Knowing how the
faculty is going to react is one
aspect of understanding the pro-
blem.”’

Fagg pointed out that the peti-
tion has been directed toward
the students. “Since there will
be a referendum,"’ he added, “‘I
think we ought to leave it up
to the students.”

A motion to table until the
next meeting any expression of
opinion was made and passed.
Discussion of the problem was
closed with a reminder from
Council for members to con-
sider all possible consequences
of the proposed change before
the next meeting.
