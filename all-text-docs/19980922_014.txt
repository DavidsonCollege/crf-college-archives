If the cliche “starting out on the right foot”
ever applies, it applies to the Wildcat’s perfor-
mance against UNCG last Tuesday. The Wildcat
volleyball team started their season of Southern
Conference play against the Spartans of UNC-
Greensboro on September 15th at Belk Arena.

The starting six for
{Wildcats 3 the Wildcats’ home opener
UNCG 0 was senior Janet Duncan,

junior Gina Lawrence,
sophomores Mara Mordini and Brooke Bentley,
and freshmen Jennifer Ortega and Erica Schwartz.
The Wildcats are a team of young, explosive talent
that are already enjoying success. Entering into
the game against UNC-Greensboro the Wildcats
had a record of 5-3. The Spartans were 2-3 at the
start of play.

Brooke Bentley served to open the game.
After the first point was scored, Bentley had a
service ace to start the Wildcats off with a 2-0 lead.
The Spartans tied the game at 2-2 when a kill by
Jennifer Ortega brought the serve back to the
Wildcats.

The game progressed to 8-4 in favor of the
Wildcats. The team was playing well and starting
off their first game in conference play positively.
The Spartans responded and tightened the gap at 8-
7.

UNCG briefly took the lead at 9-8. A kill by
Mara Mordini regained the serve for the Wildcats,
and from then on, the Spartans would not score
again. Another kill by Mordini after a serve by
sophomore Katherine Lorenz ended the first game
at 15-9.

After being tied at 7-7, the Wildcats began to
pull away after senior Sarah Covell entered the
game. Five unanswered points moved the Wild-
cats into the lead at 12-7 when the Spartans re-
gained the serve and scored two straight.

The Spartans would get.no closer. On the
strength of the play of Jennifer Ortega and Mara
Mordini, the Wildcats closed out the second game
at 15-9. The good start that they accomplished in
game one was now carrying them through to
victory.

The Wildcats scored six straight points to
open the final game. The Spartans put up a tough
fight, but miscommunications-and botched plays.
hurt them the entire game. The Wildcats did not

ease the pressure even when the score closed to 9-
7. After regaining serve, the Wildcats scored once.
The Spartans closed the gap again to 10-9, but
could not tie the game. The Wildcats closed out the
match at 15-9.

Three straight 15-9 games told the story of
the Southern Conference opener for the Wildcats.
Underlying the score was the fact that, as Head
Coach Lisa Marston said, the Wildcats “did what
they had to do (to win).” Coach Marston was also
happy with the depth displayed by the team, as she
was able to use a rotation of ten different players
in the victory.

Setter Erica Schwartz led the team with 41
assists while Mara Mordini had 15 kills to lead the
offense. Jennifer Ortega played a sharp game and
had 11 kills. Defensively the star was Brooke
Bentley, who had twelve digs in the game.
