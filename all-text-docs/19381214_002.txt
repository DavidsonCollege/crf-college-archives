Yuletide

Christmas! Holidays. danees. carols,
parties, old flamesmgoli, mornings in bed.
fireworks, Rose Bowl game, colored lights,
turkey and eranberries, no school, and again
no school .

It means a glorious couple of weeks when
everybody's widnout a ‘care in the world and
having the biggest time possible. There'll
be thousands of Christmas trees, a universe
o! lighted stars, miles of red ribbon, sheets
and sheets of white paper. all contributing to
the magnificent spectacle of an American
Christmas. There'll be literally millions of
stockings for American Santa Clauses to fill,
millions of presents for Mothers to wrap,
millions of people waiting in line at the
stamp windows. Yes, Christmas in America
ig a great thing jor allofus..

And so it should be. But in the midst of
all our tosting oi horns, crashing oi fire-
works, our grandiose eclebration—Iet us
pause. just a moment to think of what
Christmas really means after all On that
clear and starry night in sleepy little Pales-
tine nineteen hundred thirty-eight years
ago, there was no ianfare, no fireworks;
ali was calm and silent as “the wondrous
giit” that has changed the world was given.
Simplicity was the theme.

It’s just a serious thought for all of us to
take home. And till we meet again on
January 4th, “God rest ye, merry gentle-

”

men.

A Little Cooperation

The main purpose of the Davidson Col-
lege Y.M.C.A., according to the Secretary
in the SY” Handbook, is “to make Christ a
reality in the life of every student.” Cer-
tainly no one can say that the “Y” Cabinet
has failed to do its part in achieving this
objective, but has the rest of the student
body fulfilled its obligation?

Recently, in the hope and trust that the
student body had fulfilled its obligation,
and that Christ had become a reality to
them the Cabinet decided after long delib-
eration to take a drastic and revolutionary
step with the collection of this year’s Christ-
mas Gift Fund. Heretofore, this fund, us--
ed to meet crying needs, had been raised
from the students and iaculty by all the
means known to canvassers and collectors.
Dormitory contests were staged, and in-
tensive canvassing used in the effort to go_
over the top. And these methods worked,
or at least they got the monetary results.

Relying on the generosity and true Christ-
ian spirit of the Davidson “Gentlemen,” the
campaign, under the direction of - Archer
Torrey, was made into a free-will offering,
in which no one was obliged to contribute,
no pressure was exerted to “force” students
to sign, pledges, each man was to give be-
cause he felt like giving, and as much as
he felt like giving.

The sad thing about it all is that, as this
is being written, it seems that the student
body is badly lacking in that quality which
by now they should have absorbed. I say
“seems” because maybe there are extenuat-

—_—

ing circumstances. But the fact that after
a week in which there has been ample op-
portunity to-give, approximately only one-
sixth of amotnts givey in other years has
been collected speaks tor itself.

“But.” vou ask. “what can I do about it?”
You. ao matter how self-centered an atti-.
tude you may have had beiore. can at least
try to the best of your ability to forget that
and taink of others and their needs, which
are certainly more pressing (nan yours, and
iry to do Something for them. Get outside
of vour own petty trials and think upon the
good you can do ior those less fortunate
thai you. Cast your bread, no matter if it
be but a crumb, upon the waters!

JACK ABERNATHY.

Watch it

Something that has been done for many
years in the past and has been innocent e-
nought has only recently resulted in a very-
serious initry. This is the practice of throw-
ing tennzs balls and other missiles in the
dormitory halls. * :

___ We hate to think of. another restriction
“placed on sindents living in dormitories,
but last week one of our students came
within a traetion of an inch of losing the
sight of an eye. Though doctors now say
that it is probable that this stadent will
retain the eye. it shocks us to a state of
reality.

Should students nave another restriction
placed on them, especiatly such a simple
sounding one: We are the first to object
to: this proceedure. However, something
should and must be done. Let us suggest
that the President of the Student Body
make a gentleman's agreement with the stu-
dents that such practices will not occur i
the future.

Campus Comments

There are three kinds of person on our
campus, the Collegiate Type, the Serious
Type. and the Cynic. These are represent-
ed by a JSimited number of individuals who
are at the extremes. The rest of the stu-
dent body Jies somewhere between.

The Collegiate Type makes a good poli-
tician, but doesnt take polities or anything
cise very serioisiy, ble doesn't start riots
or prayer-meetings <ither one. Main pur-
pose in life: get a big kick out of it.

The Serious Type usually gravitates to
one fraternity and/or boarding house, most
oi them also living on the same hall in one
of the less expensive dormitories. These
individuals usually do not treck with money
or intellectual integrity either one. Their
main purpose ‘is to do good works. QOeceas-
ionally a Phi Bete tinds his way into their
number, but that doesn't prove anything.

The Cynie doesn’t give a darn about any-
thing except a mythical nonentity he calls
his “incellectual integrity.” Usually the pro-
iessors are out to violate this integrity,
hence he refuses to cram, smooch, or do
anything else which might help his grade.
Oiten, of course, studying in any form is
irowned upon.

The Cynic’s intellectual integcity keeps
him from toadying to the student body. His
attitude toward his fellow students is us-
ually that of deetor toward his patients.
He is perfectly willing to help the student -
body, if such help is needed, but he does
not condescend to convince the students of
his good intentions. The Cynic occasional-
ly condescends to write a letter to the Da-
vidsonian and even to sign his name to it
(in his immaturer years he writes more fet-
ters to the Davidsonian than any other
type.) These letters are always for the
good of the students, but never couched
in complimentary terms. In fact, it would
be a “violation of intellectual integrity”
sugar-coat the advice offered.

As a result, these Cynics are badly mis-
understood. But that is all to the good.
Because if we approved of them (1) they
would cease to be cynics and would be
“degraded” to the Serious Type (and lose
their “usefulness”) and (2) we would have
such a revolution trying to keep up with all
their progressive ideas, that the trustees—
would rage and the presbyteries imagine
a lot of vain things.

A final word. Don’t take a word of this
“seriously. I just happened to be loafing
around my old habitat in the Davidsonian
office and Jack Holland (in a moment of
trash weakness) asked me to write this
column. Unfortunately neither Bill Mar-
quess nor Frank Barker were around to
stop me.

P. S—I don’t give a hoot who writes
the next Campus Comments.

P.! P. S—I’ve changed my mind, I’m ask-
ing Bill Diehl to write the next.

To The Editor:

‘There are so many rules and reg-
ulations printed in the catalogue
and book of regulations that it is
not surprising that some students
will overlook one of these.

Almost every year some students
--first year ones, of course—have
been heard to say that it was their
opinion that college fees wefe paid
by the semester and the next in-
stallment would not be due until
February Ist.

The College Treasurer, when in-
terviewed, stated that fees are fixed
on a yearly basis and payable in
two installments—one-hali at the
opening oi College and the bal-
lance on return to the campus ait-
er the Christmas holidays.

It has been the custom in the
past for a letter to go out from
the Treasurer’s office during the
holidays to the students’ home ad-
dress. This letter has contained a
registration card and a tabylation
of the fees. We understand this
letter will be sent again.

1 am writing this because I be-
lieve that this information might
be of interest to a number of stu-
dents. I hope it will not find its
way to the waste basket.

(Signed) CASH.

Dear Bill:

Alumni and students will learn
with regret that Mr. Frederick
Conrad Smith, our genial Alumni
Secretary, will close his engagement
at Davidson on the first of Janu-
ary. I- feel that the occasion calls
for more than a mere announce-
ment of the fact.

Mr. Smith was elected to this
position by the Standing Committee
of the Alumni Association two and
a half years ago. It was supposed
at that time that the Alumni As-
sociation would be able to provide
for his salary and the expenses of
his office. It has not turned out that
way. The large part of the salary
and expenses has had to be borne
by the College budget. At present
the College budget is not in a posi-
tion to bear the additional expense.
Not only so, but college budgets.
in so far as possible, should be
used for keeping the teaching force
of the College up to the highest
state of efficiency.

In the meantime, Mr. Smith has
unusual newspaper gifts that should
not be confined to the routine work
of an office. There is a larger field
for his gifts and ‘in the newspaper
world than he could ever hope to
iind in the Alumni Office. As he
goes out to exercise those gifts
he may be sure of the good wishes
of all. his Davidson friends. He has
won for himself a warm place in
the hearts of the alumni and stu-
dents of the College.

Perhaps you are wonderingwha:
will become of the Alumni Office.
For the present we will have to
operate it largely by the. voluntary
services of members of the Faculty
and Adminstrative Staff and by the
services of those students who are
already connected with the Office.
In this way we hope to keep the
work on an efficient basis until
further plans can be made.

One's associations with such a
college as Davidson are not broken
easily. On saying goodbye to Da-
Vidson I think of the four years
I spent here as a student and the
two years.and a fialé that I have
been alumni secretary. They have
been happy years—years which
have helped to mold me. and which |
I hope have been of some benefit
to the college that I love. Students,
fellow workers and the townspeople
alike have been wonderfully kind
and it is with sincere regret that I
leave to take up new work else-
where. My greatest hope is that
Davidson will continue to grow and
to prosper and to spread abroad its
intluence for good.

It’s Movie Mogul Darryl Zan-

whole thing off and begin concen-

At_least_we can be thankiul we
were not brought up under the
doctrines of Brigham Young.

As the old year draws toa close.
we often muse about pleasant oc-

us. There are two members of the

forms innumerable services ior all
the College athletic teams. For both
of them we wish the most enjoy-
able holiday season possible.

It’s too bad that Master Mar-
quess is too ill to defend himself
just when we have received the
dope that he is somewhat of a
rake in his own home state, but he
probably could not look you in the
eye and deny it anyway. Into -my~
mailbox came a letter from several
young ladiés from Agnes Scott
wanting to find out “the newést
ideas of the most honorable editor
of the Davidsonian on what a per-
fect Davidson gentleman should be
like, and where he got his remark-
able ideas.” We will try to run an
interview on this as soon as pos-
sible.

To get down to the doings of
the week-end, we have a few in-
cidents we just have to mention;

from trips to the bandstand to re-
trieve lost articles ... Ladies’ man
Jimmy Cooper not known well en-
ough_by_young Gastonian_to rate_
a date so he pulled the old borrow-
ing act for the figure... Sonny
Cunningham setting a new endur-
ance record in the bath tub... All
the magical art of Colin Smith
availing him nothing in his attempt
to date charming Miss Connie
Moore: a story of her life was the
best Shaw secured. +. The Spirit
of V.M.I. being played for Colonel
Liipfert when You're Gonna Lose
Your Gal would have been more
appropriate ... Popeye McAlpine

Friday night ... Bob Miller dras-
tically changing his schedule for
the wéek-end Loch Hunter
wanting to know why girls leave
him for the likes of Jecp Gladden

ternity brother should share gladly.

Christmas possible, but be sure and
tell me about it when you get back.

In the Groove

By TOM PERRIN

CHRISTMAS SERVICE ... It
seems that no matter how many
times we've attended the service
ourselves. we are invariably struck
with amazement at the crowds that
flock to Davidson: for the Christ-
mas vespers each year. Not that
the program isn’t worthy of all the
attention it draws, but it is end-
lessly surprising to us that a pre-
sentation which gets so precious
little publicity always packs Chamb-
ers tight to the doors. Our journal-
istic chapeaux are doffed to the
musicians who’ present such a cred-
itable performance.

LOCAL COLORERS ... Speak-
ing of Davidson successes, we
would like to remind you of the
student art exhibit last year, of
course, sponsored by that enter-
prising little sheet, “The Davidson-
ian.” Why not give campus Mich-
aelangelos and Walt” Disneys a
second chance? Not all the talent
graduated last year, even if Petty
Rembrant Ryburn, whose work was
very interesting. is no longer with
us, Judging from the number of
poster painters in business here-
abouts, there must be no dearth of
brush wielders and paint daubers.

Incidentally, we have, just heard
(after writing the paragraph above,
so help us) of the photo club ex-
hibit. Sounds like a good thing.

CHIT-CHAT ... . The ad of a
well-known watch making firm, as
seen this month in the Magazinés,
features a very nice picture of Miss
Dabney Parrish, of Greenville. who
wears one of the company's pro-
ducts. Miss Parrish’s brother also
wears one of these timepieces, ac-
cording to the advertiser, which
seems odd. since Miss Parrish, who
isn’f exactly a stranger to David-
son dances, has no brother.

Orchids, or more appropriately,
shrubs. to Mr. Hobart, college
grounds overseer, for sticking those
boxwoods around the Phi and Eu

halls. As somebody remarked, those

brick piles look less like match-
boxes now.

Scribbled in Chambers second
floor smoking room is this observ-
ance:—‘Abstinence makes the sot
grow fonder.”

Thanks to the Pan Hell boys for
the nicest Christmas present we
have gotten so far—we mean Kemp
for Midwinters, of course. From
now on, we're on their side. Don't
care if they do get rich.

SCRIPTS ’N MILLER...
“Scriptsn Pranks” alleged humor
Magazine is out, we were forced to
note, since somebody slipped one
into our P, O. Box. and Editor Mil-
ler pursues his campaign to malign

Chief Marquess’ little journal, which
doesn't seem to have suffered ap-
precitbly thereby, By now, of
course, even the freshmen have
learned what parts of the Mag are
worth reading. which are clippings

from the better papers. Reading
time: five minutes. All seriousness
aside.

Personally, though, we're tired of
this bickering between publications,
and we're making it one of our
New “Year's resolutions to forget ”
the matter.

Scores of young men who hereto-
