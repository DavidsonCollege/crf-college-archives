During the thirty-eight years in which
he has served the college in one capacity
or another, Dr. Lingle has set an example
that will long be remembered by every stu-
dent who has come under his influence. His
task, especially since he became head of this
institution, has often been difficult, never
easy. Most men would never attempt to
be a college president; few make
of it. On one hand are-alumni and parents,
steadfastly demanding certain on

vigorously for other things, while the facul-

rhythmic sounds) of some sort or another.
Most of Davidson’s fraternities have always
sung to a certain extent, and the “sing” will
henceforth give our melodiers something
to work towards.

As yet there is necessarily doubt as to
which of the chapters can sing best; and the
program presented by each should be inter-
esting, since points will be scored for origi-
nality as well as for harmony, direction,
and musical ability. Rumor has it that some
very complex arrangements will be present-.
ed, which will make the sing more than-a
series of “barber-shop” choruses, and con-
sequently make ita well-rounded _ affair,
since the barber-shop element is bound to
be present also.

The music department has done its share

by providing a beautiful trophy for the
winner. The fraternities show signs of
hard work and good programs. All that

remains is for a large audience to turn out,
and the sing is bound to be a success.

Neg . .
Although “there was “a majority of the

fraternities in favor of the plan, it would
be foolish to go through with it without
unanimous support. Another difficulty was
that some chapters passed it by a bare ma-
jority, which meant that there would have
been a large minority opposed to the plan.

When a new plan such as this is tried, it
must receive full support of all concerned,
else it is bound to failure, , If this support
had been guaranteed by every lodge, the
plan would have worked out; but as this
the Council has wisely drop-
ped the matter until next year.

Perhaps next year, after all sides of the
question have been presented more fully,
the plan may be presented again. Or there
may be a compromise plan, which seems
the best thing However, whatever

Closing Remarks

As the last issue of this year’s Davidson-
ian goes to press, it is fitting that some

few remarks be made concerning “the end.”
Almost anything which could be said would
‘be a rehash of past writings, but certain
things are fundamental truisms, and should
be more. However, in order to
conserve space and time (plus probable
boredom), we present a list of the usual
topics which are used about this time each
year, If anyone perchance should desire a
more full explanation of any topic, he will

said once

gladly be given an oral discussion at any
time.
(1) Seniors have finished the happiest

period of their lives, even though. they do

not realize it.

(2) Seniors are about to start at the
bottom once more, now being “little frogs

in a big pond,” instead of “big frogs in a
little pond.”

Seniors look backwards upon their col-

nostalgia, their minds full
of a thousand and one reminiscences.

(4) Seniors are sorrowful about
“many things left undone.”

(5) Juniors are stepping up into positions
of leadership, and henceforth may be called
“shots.”

(6) Sophomores have finished exactly
one-half of their college life, not counting
summer school.

(7) Freshmen will soon be sophomores,
and then juniors and seniors can say that
they have “that sophomore attitude.”

(8) Upperclassmen should guide next
year’s freshmen in the right paths, with
various things under this heading.

\(9) Summer vacation is a time in which
one should build his strength to meet the
demands of next year’s rigorous work. It is
a time of rest for mind and body.

(10) Let us all resolve to work harder
next year, just as we did this year.

(11) Best wishes to everyone for the sum-
mer—and those coming exams.

Letters To

NOSTALGIA
Dear Andy:
This letter is not one of criti-
cism. Neither is it a blasting mis-

‘sive for some new “cause” or clarion

call. for righteous reform. It is a
note of nostalgia. Every fleeting
moment warns us of the swiftness

with which we approach the final
day. No more-can we -write-tetters
to the editor... not to the editor
of The Davidsonian. It is a day of
no mores. .,

In spite of the administrative
blitzkriegs, the executive commit-
tee injunctions and the professorial
edicts, our days here have not all
been sad ones. Perhaps it is with
a certain delight that we recall
“one-night” stands for a term
paper due the next morn. And is it
entirely with regret that we muse
about the early morning “drives”
for a sophomore English review?

Jive Chatter

By. JULIAN McCALL and JACKIE SIMONDS

It seems as though the inimit-
able Glen ‘Miller has ‘created a
new dance style that has fostered
innumerable swing leaders to fol-
low in his steps. A new band with
an old leader comes by the way
of Ben Pollock and his double-
barrel rhythm, double-barrel insin-
uating sweet and swing. He has
just finished a successful three-
week engagement at the College
Inn of Hotel Sherman in down-
town Chicago. Incidentally, Glen
Miller used to play with Pollock.

Anoth¢r new band gaining popu-
larity rapidly is the McFarland
Twins. Although they have only
been organized about a year and
a half, they have set several at-
tendance records at different places.

Then there is Bob Chester—noth-
ing much need be said of him
around here. We all know that he
is definitely on the up-grade, and
nothing short of disaster will keep
him down, It wouldn't take a for-
tune teller to tip-off young Ted
Straeter that 1940 is going to be
a successful year for him. Though
his band is only two seasons old,

he is becoming society’s favorite

batoner, dishing out sweet-swing |

around New York’s jive spots. Be-
sides leading, he tickles the ivories
in fine fashion.

Our own Dean Hudson is ascend-
ing the well-known ladder and ab-
sorbing some lime-light. His com-
mercial program has helped him
immensely. With a little recogniza-
tion in the “Alrmstrong” section, his
cats will be kopasetic.

There are numerous other up-
and-coming bands such as Johnny
Long, Van Alexander, Harry James,
Tommy Reynolds, and many others.

P. S.: The ‘noxious’, “unhip”
Artie Shaw also has a new 31-piece,

With The Staff 3

By BOB CARTER

With the coming of spring and
the balmy weather, a’ tendency
which seems to be prevalent among
Davidson students becomes even
more pronounced; the habit, or cus-
tom, of sitting back on our
haunches, complaining about the
sorry state of affairs, criticizing
everything and everybody, and
never doing anything about it.

By doing anything about it, we
don't mean staging a riot or any
such foolishness as that. It is very
easy to patch up our troubles with
the asministration, if only we go
about it in the right way. If you
feel that your professor is doing
you wrong, don’t lay up on your
bed and “cuss” him, go and have a
talk with him and take a look into
the grade book. Then you'll see
where that D came from.

Many students here at Davidson
criticize the Y. M. C. A., its meth-
ods, and its members and officers.
Well, it’s our Y. M. C. A,, and if
anything’s going to.be done about
it we've got to do it.

This also. bringg-us° to another
point. When we naively assume the

privilege of criticizing everything
and everybody, by what right do
we assume it? We say, “What a

sorry football, or basketball, or
baseball team we have.” Before you
enter into this subject, just ask

yourself what you have done to
contribute to the success of any of
these teams. To niost of us the an-
swer will be “Nothing.”

The usual reaction to an accu-
sation of this kind is to “pass the
buck”, “Let somebody else try to
improve things, I'll just sit around
and talk about how bad conditions
are, it’s much more. fun.” We'll
leave it-all up to the president of
the student body.

Gentlemen, Davidson College is
supposed to be a democratic body,
with the students ruling them-
Selves. If it has ceased to be so,
it is because the students them-
selves have brought on this condi-
tion. :

Let us therefore remember in
the future that if We feel that we
have been done an injustice, don’t
be one of the “Dead End” kids.
Do something about it besides com-
plain.
