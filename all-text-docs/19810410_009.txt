Lowes, Harris Teeter and Cashions stock different assets

Eating independently can be
a real hassle, but it can aleo be a
valuable learning experience.
With the right amount of

planning and careful shopping -

for less than what they cost at
eating howses or ARA Slater.
How much you gain boils down
to a matter of how’ muich time”
you ate willing to invest. ;

Talking ‘to students ‘around

gard for balanced meats’ and
economy-to meticulous care in
meal and budget’ planning.

The students I interviewed
seem to confirm the stereotype
that women are better than men
at this sort of thing. When
asked what staples were needed
each week, oné girl reeled off a
list so quickly that it was hard
to get everything down, where-
as most men had to think a
while before coming up with a
list. One even admitted that he
never shopped! “‘I usually go
home for the weekends and
bring back food from home,”’ he
said. Another male student was
adamant about which foods
were necessary for good nutri-
tion, but when asked about
prices, he said they were too
much of a bother to worry
about.

Since students were not much
help in determining which sup-
ermarkets were the best, I had
to go compare prices myself. In
most cases I found Cashions to
be cheapest and Lowe’s the
most expensive. (Davidsonian
features editors Glenn Kellum
and Anne Goodwin also com-
pared prices. See their results in
the table on this page.) But
price considerations are not
always the only factors invol-

ved. Talking with the managers
of Lowe’s, Harris Teeter and
Cashions proved to be more
enlightening.

Donald Overcash, Assistant
Manager of Lowe's, said that
up to 40% of his customers are
students. Although prices at
Lowe's are higher than those at:
Harris. Teeter or Cashions, O-
vercash cited Lowe's proximity
and-easy check cashing policy

as its biggest assets.~Some
students had ‘harsh words for

‘Lowés’ high prices, but it is
‘ reasonable’ to’ consider that

Lowes sustains a 30-40% loss of

the other hand, the fact that

. Lowes isa chain tetids to
dimihish the significance of this

loss.

Harris Teeter, another chain,
is not as affected by student
business. ‘‘Some of our- hotter
specials pull people in from as
far away as Charlotte,’’ Mana-
ger Buddy James said proudly.
Produce and meat products are
the big drawing cards. James
added that the opening of
Lowes had actually increased
his total business, but decre-
ased his student business.

What about generic products,
those cute little white wrapper
commodities? The big sellers
are paper towels, oils, and
crackers, James said, but he
admitted that generic products
are often of lower quality than
nationally advertised brands.

Cashions manager Sam Cald-
well agreed, citing the syrupy
consistency of generic jellies as
an example. ‘‘I don’t see what
the big deal is,’”” he complained,
adding that some of the nat-
ional brands he carries are just a
inexpensive.

The interest in generic pro-
ducts is just one of the problems
that privately-owned Cashions
must face. Like Lowe’s, it has

to deal with decreasing summer
sales, but vacationers at Lake
Norman usually take up some of

the slack.
Lowe’s and Cashions take

differing attitudes toward unit

pricing, although neither store
uses it. Unit pricing is the
practice of listing how much an

item costs per standard unit of

weight. It enables customers to
compare relative prices among
various sizes and brands. Cald-
well said large chain stores like
Lowe’s can do this easily be-
cause of the computer systems
they have, but at Cashions
everything would have to be
done by hand, ‘‘and with ten
pages of price changes a week,
minimum, that would take a lot
of time.’’ Not only would the
process be time-consuming, he

added, but paying for the extra
labor would probably raise food
prices. Caldwell said Cashions
would hold off on unit pricing as
long as possible, but admitted
that public pressure might
make it inevitable. Until that
time it is best just to carry your
trusty calcdlaton.to find the
best deals—or shop at Harris
Teeter, the only store with unit
pricing.

In terms of serving the
college community, the three
stores differ greatly. Lowe’s
main service is convenience.

Harris Teeter has unit pricing
and is cheaper than Lowe’s, but
other than their ‘“‘hot’’ specials,
has no special attitude about
serving the college.

At Cashions, low prices are
the bottom line but there’s

On Main St. south of town

another asset for students who
come from different back-
grounds. Cashions stocks its
shelves with a greater variety of
products. A close look at Cash-
ions’ bakery or cheese section
will show that demographic as
well as ethnic backgrounds are
well-represented.

~ The choice, then, is up to the
individual. For most, trotting
across the street to Lowe’s is
the most convenient, and, for
those who do not have to plan
entire meals, the trip to Cash-
ions of Harris Teeter is probab-
ly not worth it. But those who
want wider variety and lower
prices will find that Harris
Teeter offers a lot. Cashions is
the best: competitive yet sensi-
tive to student wants and
needs.

Davidson MDs build new medical building

By TRACY THOMPSON
Staff Correspondent

Davidson doctors Ron Hunt
and Bill Williams are building a
new Davidson Medical Clinic to
be opened in August.

Hunt and Williams, who
serve the College Infirmary, are
expanding their private practice
in response to an ever-increas-
ing demand for local medical

services. Their new facility will

be located on Highway 115
approximately one-half mile
south of the Post Office. It will
replace the smaller offices be-
hind the Post Office on Railroad
StreeteThe doctors have been
renting from the College for the

past three years.

Business Manager Bob Cur-
rie said that with proper renova-
tions the present medical clinic
could be turned into housing
space for as many as twenty
students. Housing Director Bill
Bolding said, however, ‘‘The
last time I met with President
Spencer, the fate of the building
was still uncertain.”

Hunt, Williams and a third
doctor who will arrive in August
will staff the new Medical
Clinic. The new doctor will also
serve the Infirmary. Williams
said, ‘‘a fourth doctor could be
brought into the practice within

the next couple years, depend-
ing on need.”

Charlotte architectural firm
Wheatley Associates designed
the clinic and Kenneth Reed
Construction Corporation of
Huntersville is building the

_structure. The. clinic will house

twelve examination rooms, an
X-ray suite and a laboratory.

The doctors will not offer any
new services in the clinic, but
they will be able to serve more
patients. Another important
reason for the move, Williams
said, “is that another doctor
will give us a break on weekends
and after hours.”
