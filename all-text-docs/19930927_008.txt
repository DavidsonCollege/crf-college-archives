Prozac the wonder drug: The danger of buying happiness

By Stephen Faller

Fumbling through the last col-
lection of “door deals,” I found no
less than three advertisements for
discount counselling services.
Strangely enough, all three were
for the same establishment, and
even more strangely, the good doc-
tor thought he might find a market
here at Davidson. Catchy words
such as effective, safe, and easy
were used to hawk hypnosis at
bargain rates.

Help is available for all kinds
of ills and other odious personal
habits, ranging from smoking to
“loving too much” to nail biting.
There is a quick cure for every-
thing, and one need go no further
than Cornelius. Now, with less

effort than ever before, and just a
little hypnosis, you can get your-
self fixed up and become a more
productive and attractive society
member than you ever imagined.
Almost sounds reasonable, doesn’t
it?

Except it doesn’t stop there.
You can enhance’ your
assertiveness, golf, and tennis. To
me, this just seems to be one step
up from buying the perfect body.
For the right price, you too can
become the person you always
wanted to be.

To be or not to be, but more
importantly, do I have enough
money, for that is the question.
The American Dream has indeed
taken on another direction, but life

can’t be bought, and one doesn’t
get to have a rich life just from
shelling out the appropriate num-
ber of bucks. It takes much more
than therapy sessions, anti-depres-
sants, and hypnosis.
Anti-depressants are the most
dangerous ofall (and Prozac more
dangerous than others), because
they touch us more effectively
than any jargon about freeing
one’s “child.” Here the risk is not
just confusing oneself about the
nature of things, but tampering
with one’s own delicate chemis-
try.
It is not my point in any way
to deny anybody who used or is
presently using any chemical anti-
depressant the compassion that

they need and deserve. Perhaps
such a drug is their only choice. It
is only my point to raise an issue.
The issue: How awful it is, if one
living being, just one, used such a
drug when they didn’t need it. The
details of such a hypothetical case
are not necessary. Just the horrible
proposition that somebody need-
lessly altered their mind. Remem-
ber "One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest?"

Why settle for comfortably
numb when we can do one better?
Why bother to feel bad when it’s
perfectly natural to want to feel
good? Of course, now we don’t
see. generally feeling down and
unmotivated for whatit is. Instead
we name it clinical depression and

lobotomize the brain with a “won-
der drug” - Prozac.

Despite its popularity, I call
Prozac a lobotomy. If my mother
were killed, everyone would be
mortified if someone chemically
altered my brain because of, and
for the prevention of, my mourn-
ing.

But, if I have stopped taking
the time out to enjoy life or have
never taken the initiative to find
out what makes life good (and this
would be a much sadder catastro-
phe than the death of anyone I
know), methinks few people would
object to chemical alteration of my
brain, and consequently, perhaps

Test your
beliefs to
learn faith

By Will Lazenby
As Davidson students, we face
alot of challenges. Tough classes,
relationships, sports and multitudes
of extra-curricular activities inun-
date us daily. However, there is
one aspect of student life, often
taken for granted and neglected,
that deserves some attention: faith.
Faith means different things
for different people. For me, faith
lies in believing in and always be-
ing aware of a clear pattern run-
ning through my life. I try to
understand that there is a reason
for everything, and see a-divine
planinall that is happening around
me. But no matter how you define
your faith, it needs to be strong
enough to bolster you through any
adversity that life throws your way.
Faith is the calm in the midst of
life’s tempest, the ability to let go
of pain and understand that every-
thing is O.K. just as it is.
Yet most of us are content to
.keep our faith hidden, unexposed
to life’s pitfalls and adventures.
Every so often we pull out our
shiny faith, perhaps in conversa-
tion, perhaps on Sunday morning,
and turn it over in our hands to
admire its polished, unscratched
surface. Then back it goes in its
protective chamber, and back we
go to life as usual.
The beauty ofa strong faith is
its no-matter-what-ness. That is, a
Strong faith is reliable any time,
anywhere, to carry you through
whatever circumstance you’re
dealing with. But for faith to be
secure and beliefs to be strong,
they need to be challenged.
Thavesome friends that claim
to be strong Christians. They at-
tend church and Intervarsity regu-
larly, and seem in every aspect to
be acting on their beliefs. But
some aren’t willing to take a reli-
gion class here that might contra-
dict those beliefs. If we are going
to live our lives according to a
doctrine or belief, shouldn’t that

The postman always rings twice

By Tony Tuntasit

Did you know that Ultra Tide
with “OUTSTANDING WHIT-
ENING POWER” is on sale for
$3.47 at Roses? If you had read the
key Roses flyer in your mailbox
you would have. ButI mustadmit,
seeing the Roses literature through
the little P.O. box keyhole isa little
more reassuring than seeing the
postal workers actually putting the
flyer in my box and having this
exact conversation:

POSTAL WORKER #1:

Gosh, Tony still hasn’t gotten
any mail.

POSTAL WORKER #2:

Yeah, Iknow. He didn’t’ even
getthe Special J. Crew Octoberfest
& Sauerkraut Fall Preview.
POSTAL WORKER #1:

I know, let’s slip him this old
Roses flyer from 1982. He'll
never know the difference.
POSTAL WORKERS:

Hahahahahahahaha!

Actually, I was quite happy
the other day when I opened my
mailbox and found a letter that I
was expecting from my pal Kathy
until I realized that the letter was
not actually from Kathy but from
my old girlfriend Rachel. My only
question is: (this is addressed to
the mail man, the general public,
The Supreme Postmaster General

etc...) WHO GAVE HER MY
ADDRESS? Certainly not my
friends, nor I.

Actually, I’m willing to bet
that good old Ed “You could win
100 quadrillion dollars!!”
McMahon gave it to her. And by
the way, who gave him my ad-
dress?

Ex-girlfriends are probably all
very nice people who go out a lot,
play sports, talk on the phone,
watch “Baywatch,” play Bingo,
anduseF.B.I. Manhunt Techniques
to look for your address.

Most guys on my hall are
friends with their girlfriends but
don’t enjoy getting letters from
them.

And the reason why we don’t
want to get letters from our ex-
girlfriends is because as men, we
see subliminal scary messages hid-
den in the actual content of the
letter. Let me show you how a
typical letter from an ex looks to
the typical guy:

Dear Tony, [We see: Oh my dear-
est Tony,]

So, how is college life? [So,
how is life without me?] I know
that Davidson is very difficult so I
hope you are handling the work
okay. [So, how is life without me?]
Is the social life exciting? [So, how
is life without me?]

I’m sure it is. [You miss me,

don’t you?]

College just isn’t the same.
[The halls are empty without you.]
I tried calling you this summer. [I
really, really, really want to get
back together again.] [hada pretty
cool summer. [Ihad this really neat
dream once that we were on some
deserted, tropical island off Aruba.]
Too bad it’s over. [Too bad I woke
up.}

Well, I just wanted to let you
know that I’ve been thinking about
you. [AAAAARGH!] I hope you
are enjoying yourself. [Well, Ijust
wanted to let you know that I’ve
been thinking about you.] Don’t
getstressed. [I’ll be waiting.] Take
care. [Marry me.]

Love,

[We’ll have beautiful

children.]

Rachel

Are guys reading into this too
much? Are webeing justalittle bit
too paranoid? Yup.

But relationships usually dis-
figure the way men and women
look at each other so the paranoia
is just normal.

So when you get a letter from
the ex, just give them a short typi-
cal college reply and then at the
end tell them that you're sorry that
the letter is so short but that you’ve
got todosome laundry. Ultra Tide
calls.

Racism vs.
Prejudice

By Rafael Candelario and
Travis Hinson

Both Travis and Rafael take
offense at being called racist.
People use words without know-
ing their meaning. Minorities can
be prejudiced, but not racist. Rac-
ism implies economic and politi-
cal power; minorities until recently
have not had access to either.

Here is anexample of racism:
Jones Dept. Store is hiring a new
manager. A Native American goes
to apply and is told the position is
taken. Next week Jones Dept. Store
hires John Doe with blue eyes and
blond hair. That is institionalized
racism.

Butanyonecanbe prejudiced,
especially people in the lower
socio-economic classes. For ex-
ample: Antonio Corlione (Italian)
says, “Look at those WASPs, my
pop's told me all about ‘em!”

Fortunately, Travis and Rafael
are neither racist nor prejudiced;
although like everyone else, we
may have stereotypes about cer-
tain groups. Example: Most
Davidson white boys can’t dance!
(Joke, haha.) But, we are trying to
learn through multiculturalism and
shared learning. Essentially, if you
are not part of the solution, you are
part of the problem.

The following excerpt comes
from Paula Rothenberg’s Race,
Class, & Gender. The “you” and
“us” she refers to is the dominant
group, or to be exact, whites in
general.

“Even though most of us do
not like to think of ourselves as
either believing in, or engaging in,
such dominations, it is, in fact,
difficult for a member of a domi-
nant group todo otherwise. _

"But to keep on doing these
things, one need only behave ‘nor-
mally.’

“[Whites] can even believe
that both they and the subordinate
groupshare thesame interests and,
to some extent, the same experi-
ence...Folk tales, black jokes, and
women stories are often based on
how the wily peasant or sharecrop-
