LITERARY SOCIETIES
Pandeinic |

The Pandeinic Society held its regular |

meeting Thursday evening at 7:00 o'clock, |

; after an intervention of two weeks, since |

their regular time of meeting fell on)

| Thanksgiving afternon. The house was |

called to order by president Glen Ed- |
dington, followed by the roll call to
which the number that answered was

{comparatively few, probably due to the

fact that the Junior-Senior basketball
game came off at the same hour. A very
impressive meeting was carried out. The

debate on the subject, “Resolved: That
the income tax publicity law should be
repealed. ” The affirmative side of the
query was upheld by J. M. Garrison and
J. S. Gray and the negative side by R. H.
MclIlwain and E. J. Spear. The decision
was rendered in favor ofthe affirmative.
The debate was followed by some very
interesting current events given by N.
B. Rice. P. J. Garrison concluded the
Program with a very good declamation,
and on the motion of W. J. Webb second-
ed by T. E. Hall the society adjourned to
meet again next Thursday at the usual |
hour.

Philanthropic |
The Philanthropic Society held its week- |
ly meeting last Thursday night with 2
very good number present. |

The subject for the evening was Re- |
solved: The Income Tax Publicity Clause
Should Be Repealed. The affirmative
side was upheld by A. W. Baker, R. F.
Hall, and W. C. Archie; the negative |
by H. Y. Alexander, R. G. Calhoun, and |
S. W. DuBose. The decision was given in |
favor of the negative. |

In view ofthe fact that allthe ques-
tions brought up for debate have so
many good and bad points, three men on
each side ‘were used. The debate was
handled in a very able manner, showing

| that plenty of study had been put on the

subject.

After the main debate, an extemporan- |
eous debate was held on the subject, The |
Pen is Mightier Than the Sword. M. A.
