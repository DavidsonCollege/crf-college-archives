COMMENCEMENT PREPARATIONS.

All around us we sce the effect of the
forces which are building for a success-
ful and = memorable Commencement.
Many classes have signified their inten-
tion of being present and many individ-
ual members—imore than usual, have
written that they are going to be back
on the Hill again the last days of May.

Every sign would seem to point to the
fact that this event will mark the be-
ginning of a new era in Davidson his-
tory, when the interest of the alumni
will be more marked than in former
days.

Not a stone is being left unturned to
bring to an carly completion the endow-
ment campaign for the additional hun-
dred thousand dollars. As we know,
one-fourth of this sum will go at once
into the Alumni Gymnasium—the first
concrete testimonial in an organized way
on our campus of the loyalty of the men
who have learned to love the old Col-
lege. Proceeds from the remainder of
the endowment will go to build up the
efficiency of the institution, which is now
crowded to the doors. The point has
been reached where the numbers will be
increased only in proportion to the addi-
tional resources provided.

This Commencement coming at the
end of a campaign which has been pri-
marily among the Alumni and which, in
many cases, has brought to mind forgot-
ten memories of the College, should be
exceptional in the attendance and inter-
est of classes planning reunions this year.

With these facts before us and con-
stantly in our minds, everyone should
lend every effort to see that this Com-
mencement is not only in itself enjoy-
able, but that it is memorable, in that it
is marked with the spirit of constructive
work, and a vision of the possibilities of
Davidson.

To make this trie, preparation is nec-
essary. and every friend of the College
should begin todav to plan for this, the
closing event of the vear, which, as the
name signifies, should not be an ending
but a Commencement of a Greater Dav-
idson.

WEEKLY MEETINGS.

The meetings of the Fumenean Lit-
erary Society last weck were not quite
up to standard. ‘There was, however,
very good attendance and attention for
this season. On Saturdav night the sub-
ject, “Resolved, ‘That Congress should
pass a bill warning Americans from arm-
ed vessels,” was debated. The affirma-
tive was upheld by T. J. Mitchell, Potts,
Cousar, and J. P. Williams, whose
arguments centered around the point
that a few “speculators” would thus not
jeopardize the whole nation. On the
negative, J. B, Woods, Morton, W. G.
Morrison, and Boggs contended — that
such a bill would lower America’s na-
tional pride. As a whole the debate was
weak, few good points being brought
out, and many left untoucht. The usual
fire and spirit was lacking. The decis-
ion was awarded to the affirmative.

The Monday meeting was better. W.
Y. Sayad gave an oration on the same
subject that was debated Saturday night,
stressing some of the untoucht points.
P. B. Price spoke on the means of im-
proving the Social Center, suggesting a
few remedies. L. A. Mullen gave a
description of a visit to the Grand Can-
yon. Four very good declamations were
rendered by McCloy, Brand, Fraser and
Frierson.

The negative side of the query: “Re-
solved, That the United States should
warn passengers not to travel on bellig-
erent merchant ships armed for defense,”
by a 2 to 1 vote, won the decision in the
Saturday night debate of the Philan-
thropic Society. The less experienced
debaters showed fair preparation,’ while
those who were expected to make good
debates showed more miserly prepara-
tion. J. D. McLeod, for the affirmative.
and D, Shaw, the latter appointed on.
argued well the fundamental issues of
the query.

On Monday morning R. B. Peters
and §. M. Davis gave fair declamations.
J. H. Carson gave a good oration on
“The Tobacco Trust.” Decidedly the
most interesting and profitable oration of
the morning was by T. D. Sparrow on
the subject, “Bits of North Carolina
History Very Little Known.”

The new floor in the store building of
Armour Bros. & Thompson is now near-
ing completion, and it is expected that
they will be able to move the stock of
goods back again within a short time.
The new floor is of cement, constructed
according to modern methods.

Bill Osteen, ex-'16, has signed up to
play base ball with Augusta, Ga., this
summer. Last year he twirled for Mor-
ganton, and made the leading record of
the Western North Carolina League.
During the past winter he has been a
book keeper for the Morganton Furni-
ture Company. He will leave for Au-
gusta immediately.
