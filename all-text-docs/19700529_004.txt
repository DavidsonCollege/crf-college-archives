‘Non-Scholar’ Hays Feels

ex Congressman
Brooks Hays assured his
audience Tuesday.

At 10 a. m., throwing
away his prepared text,
Hays spoke ex¥émpore to
his listeners in the Morris-
son Room. An ex-president
of the Southern Baptist Con-
vention, he attacked ‘the
dogmas that restrict our in-
tellectual growth.”’

Moving. on to the present
student unrest, Hays cited
his own personal experience
with a young man he had_ in
a seminar atJRutgers when
he was Arthur Vanderbilt
Professor of Public Affairs.

“There was a young man
there,” he recalled, ‘‘who
challenged things -I thought
were unchallengeable.’’ The
two argued for four hours.
From this experience, Hays
said, he learned that stu-
dents. today are impatient
with cliches.

As for the much-debated
and order Hays
said in .a_ ringing voice,
“Public order we will have.
People don't tolerate dis
order. Hilter had order but
it didn’t last because there
was no justice.”

Hays is therefore oppos-
ed to the current law and
jorder rhetoric, he said, be-
cause it ignores the need for
justice, which is the other
half of the picture.

He affirmed his belief in

In his afternoon speech at
1:30 .p. m., Hays apologized
for keeping his audience in
after the beginning of the
11:00 a. m. class hour; say-
ing that like Disraeli he was
“inebriated with the exuber-
ance of my own verbosity.”

Hays said that Georgia's

Student Aid Seen As Key
To Control‘Campus Thefts

According to Security Offi-
cer Ed N. Linker and records
on file-in the Dean of Stu-
dents Office, hundreds of dol
lars worth of cameras, stereo
tape players, personal items,
and car parts have been stol-
en from students’ dormitory
rooms and cars.

Linker said that he beliey-
ed “a ring in the area” is
responsible for the thefts. He
added that the thieves have
also been striking the towns
of Davidson and Cornelius.

“There is a steady pattern
about one per
Linker said. He stat-
ed that their usual procedure
was to enter locked cars
through side vent windows by
either forcing them or break-
ing them.

“Some convertible
have even been slashed,”
Linker added, ‘‘so that the,

vandals may gain aetess to
articles in the cars.”

Linker said that there has
been a gradual increase in
theft from year to vear due
to more people in the area.
He added that the wave of
such thefts last year shows
a connection between thefts
from cars.and thefts. from
the dormitories.

Director of Physical Plant
Grover C. Meetze, Jr. stated
that the security guards have
“watching duties for the
physical “plant security
against fire,” and could not
completely control all prop
erty on the campus,

However, he added that the
security Binicens “have been
most helpful in times past”
in reporting thefts and evi-
dence and in working close-
ly with the local police ito
apprehend the vandals.

Meetze noted that the se-

curity forcé is ‘limited in

Meetze recommended that
“the work-study program be
expanded to include a Stu-
dent security force,” and
that “the SGA should vote
on who would become offi-
cers.”

To reduce the number of
thefts, Meetze stated that
“everyone needs to help.” He
suggested, for example, that
students take notice of park-
ed cars, since ‘“‘you can tell
a lot about who’s on campus
from parked cars.”

Johnny Bruner, a junior
concerned with the car thefts
stated that the areas most
frequently hit are the park-
ing areas on the fraternity
court and the lot behind

He noted that ‘similar

“The Constitution means

is thought to have lost his
seat in 1958 by coming out
against segregated — school
systems in Arkansas.

He pointed out that Rob-
ert E. Lee said at the end
of the Civil War that the
South would obey the Con-
stitution and be kind to the
“emancipated Negro.”

Hays feels that there is
excessive criticism’ of the -
South by the North, but far
too little criticism from the
people from the South.

“The paternal kindness of
nineteenth century is
not adequate for this dy-
namic twentieth century;’
Hays pointed out.

America cannot survive
“eighty percent affluent
and twenty percent poor,”’
he warned, adding that the
proximity of poverty to gen-
eral prosperity was what
makes proverty in America
so bad.

Hays said he hoped) that
some of Nixon's advisers
will get the President to
fulfill his campaign _ pro-
mises to “bring us together”’
and feed poor children.
