Humanities Major And His Science

Last week, THE DAVIDSONIAN
lamented the growing schism between
science and the humanities. We spoke
particularly in relation to the pre-med
and science major at Davidson. How-
ever, the situation with the humanities
major is equally a cause for concern.

The humanities major leaves David-
son without a proper science back-
ground in what is truly an age of sci-
ence. He too, is falling short of the
goal of the desirable liberal arts edu-
cation.

Just as the science major needs
some program through which he can
derive an appreciation for the inter-
relationship of all ideas and culture,
the humanities major likewise needs
such a knowledge and appreciation in
the realm of science. He is not present-
ly getting this.

Except for an occasional rarity, the
non-science major graduates with only
one science course at Davidson, that
one being required. In most. cases, he
took that same science in high school.
and perhaps one other. Even allowing
for outstanding high school courses,
unjustified in many cases, he has a
weak background. Of the three major
sciences, he has in all likelihood
never taken at least one and has only
a very passing acquaintance with a
second. ©

"He does get one at Davidson. But
even here, the course is insufficient.
He sits in the same classroom with
those students planning to continue
in science, and understandably, the
course is directed to the latter. The

professor must furnish them with the
foundation necessary for advanced

courses. There is much technical
knowledge, many details—all of which
are necessary for the continuing sci-
ence student, but NOT for the individ-
ual who will never take another sci-
ence course.

Too frequently, the course becomes
a real chore and bore for him. He is
only too happy when he has completed
his requirement and proceeds to for-
get all the details he will never have
occasion to use. Tragically, he is still
without an acceptable knowledge of
the sciences or appreciation of their
value.

Is there any solution to the prob-
lem? We believe so, and in the remain-
ing weeks of this spring and continu-
ing next fall, THE DAVIDSONIAN in-
tends to explore possible solutions
with the hope of arriving at some
suitable concrete suggestions. We
will talk with professors, contact other
schools and be receptive to any sug-
gestions and aid.

There are already several possibili-
ties: an integrated course in the sci-
ences; a two-year program requiring
one course in a physical science and
one in a natural science; putting non-
science majors in special sections of

‘first year courses—perhaps recent |

changes in the basic math course
might serve as a guide. There also
might be advantages in a history of
science course, or a philosophy of sci-
ence.

We have no claims to a sure-fire
solution at present. But we hope to
find an acceptable one which warrants
consideration and action by the fac-

ulty.

The “Word” Is Atrocious

“The ‘word’ is APPROPRIATE,”
said the promotional literature, a bit
ungrammatically. ‘‘Yes, it is appropri-
ate that the handsome, new Music and
Fine Arts Building proposed for Da-
vidson College should bear the name
of John R. Cunningham...”

Now the “word” is being made
bricks and mortar, glass and steel—
but mostly bricks. Dr. Cunningham's
monument looks more atrocious than
appropriate.

The college's literature, designed to)
interest the wealthy in underwriting
the building’s $650,000 price tag, went
into rhapsodic praise about the poten-
tialities of the structure: “The Music
and Art Center will be an additional
instructional facility and yet it will be
a place of singular beauty . . . beauti-
ful in itself and dedicated to beauty
as expressed in music, drama, and all
the arts.” It will be “the final struc-
ture to make the Old Quadrangle one
of the most attractive and useful on
any campus... anywhere.”

Phooey.

As the Fine Arts Building has been
taking shape, we’ve watched busy
workmen building blank. brick walls,
first on the street side, then on the
back. Finally, they built the high brick
spine that juts out on both sides of the
center section.

Yet this is the building planned to
teach students “good design, indus-
trial or otherwise, and good architec-
ture.”

We recall the long planning stages,
when everyone and his uncle threw in

suggestions for the building. In an ef-
fort to crowd: everything into one
“structure, the architect had to cut
corners. As a result:

—The “intimate’’ theater is exactly
that: 288 seats are crowded into a
room not as deep as the large lecture
room in the Dana building.

—The “spacious exhibition halls”
are less than 11 feet wide—not wide
enough for a spectator to get a good
perspective on a large painting.

—There are no doors large enough
to get a pre-built backdrop into the
theatre.

—The art studios, suposed to take
advantage of daylight, are on the east
side of the building, and will get sun
only in the early morning.

—High brick walls were needed to
mask heating and air-conditioning
ducts, which, had the building been a
bit larger, could have been included
inside.

—Visiting actors and actresses will
have to use classrooms as dressing
rooms—there was no room for sepa-
rate dressing facilities.

But the “living room for Davidson-
ians” is going up ahead of schedule.
By September we will have spent our
$650,000 for much-needed facilities.
And the John R. Cunningham. Music
and Fine Arts building will stand as a
memorial to compromise and penny-
pinching. We weren’t asking for a $2.5
million arts center; but we wish a little
bit more attention had been paid to
details.

Patterson Hits HUAC,
Questions Abolition Film

BY OR. E. F. PATTERSON

Several questions might be
asked about fe affaire Opera-
tion Abolition. One, Does the
Communist Party of the Unit-
ed States have the -right, le
gal or otherwise, to organize
a demonstration against the
House Un-American Activi-
ties Committee (here-after re-
ferred to as HUAC)?

Two, does HUAC have the
right, legal or etherwise, to
prepare or endorse a film in
an effort to discredit oppo-
sition to the Committee? The
answer to these questions is
obviously, YES.

NEXT QUESTION

The next question is, did
the Communist Party of the
U. S., or individual members
thereof, organize or seize con-
trol and direction of the stu-
dent demonstration against
HUAC in San Francisco?

The answer given to this
question by numerous objec-
tive observers of all shades
of political and religious be-
liefs- is unequivocally, NO!

The next question is: Is
HUAC bound by high stand-
ards of truth. honor and con-
cern for basic human rights
in .the preparation of the
film, or does the end justify
the means, and therefore
HUAC can use the same low
standards of which it accus-
es the Communists of using?

This of course, is not a
question of fact, but one of
values, and the answer de-
pends largely on one’s phi-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

losophy. I submit that if the
answer stems from our finest
and best philosophical, politi-
cal and religious principles,
HUAC would be expected to
adhere to the highest stand-
ards of truth and honor.

NO HONOR

The next question is, does
the film, Operation Abolition,
reflect truth, honor and de-
cency? The answer to’ this,
again coming from numerous
objective observers reflecting
all shades of political and re-
ligious beliefs, is an equally
unequivocal, NO-

The next question is, why
would members of Congress
stoop so low? To one who has
followed the history of
HUAC, the answer to this
question is clear. There was
considerable evidence two or
three years ago that the sins
of HUAC were rapidly catch-
ing up with it.

CONGRESSMEN FEAR

Many thought that ‘either
the Supreme Court or Con-
gress would soon curb its ex:
césses or abolish it. Le effaire
Operation Abolition so put
fear in the hearts of Congres-
smen that only six voted to
eliminate HUAC’S appropria-
tien in the current Congress.

Mr. Dooley said that “the
Supreme Court follows the
election returns,” and the re-
cent 5 to 4 decision upholding
gontempt proceedings against
Frank Wilkinson is evidence
of Mr. Dooley’s keen insight.
Mr. Justice Black in a dissent

Stated: “I think it clear that
this case involves nothing
more or less than an attempt
by HUAC to use the contempt
power of the House as a
weapon against those who
dare to criticize it.”
Methinks le affair Opera-
tien Abolition is nothing
more or less than an attempt
by HUAC to brand in the
eyes of the ‘public all who

criticize it as Communists.
DUTY

The last question is, what
is the duty of the citizen tru-
ly concerned with the future
of democracy in the United
States? The answer to this
question is, he should protest
vigorously and often.

Victor Gollanez has writ-
ten: “Anything done in a
democratic country is done
in your name: because, unless
you protest, it is as if you
were doing it in your own
person: and beeause a man
who does something to anoth-
er without facing what it is,
has failed to learn the first
rudiments of decent living.”

And _ Abraham Lincoln
said: “To sin by silence when
they should protest makes
cowards out of men.”

Goethe wrote that every
generation must win the bat-
tle for freedom, and David-
son College students who pro-
test the distortions of the
film can be proud of their
part in helping win the cur.
rent battle.

Salley Charges Biased Bulletin

Dear Editor:

This is perhaps too sober a
letter for a weekend not tra-
ditionally given over to so-

. briety. However, one occa-

sionally wonders .if there is
ever a weekend when David-
son is sober.

To wit, it seems Davidson
has a new editorial voice.
'Monday’s chapel announce-

ment sheet, No. 51, ran a sub-

‘ the expose of the ROTC De-
pertment’s own fine film
festival, “Operation Aboli.
tion.” “This film is a distor-
tion of the San Francisco
student riots“ followed the
rather suggestive caption
“BRAINWASHING.”

It also seems our new her-
ald of American Civil Liber-
ties has taken his style from
Robert W. Moon's column
and a half in the Christian
Century for January 4, 1961,
whose argument, like that of
editorials in the WHarvard
Crimson and the Washington
Post stems from a statement
of the sheriff of San Francis-
co County—“There was no
act of physical aggression on
the part of tho students’—
taken in good faith from
Paul Jacob's reporting in the
Reporter Magazine for No-
vember 24, 1960.

With three so commanding
publications basing their ed-
itorial opinion on the same
source, the Church League of
America (offices in Wheaton,
NIL) thought it would be in-
teresting to see upon what
The Reporter based its opin-
ion.

it wee. Sheriff Matthew C.

Cerberry put himself on re-
cord as being on the scene
Thursday and Friday until o
luncheon conference with
chairman Willis. “The disor-
der took place during lunch-
eon and | was in no position
to know anything about them.
1 did not make that state.
ment.’

And our editor's authority
seems to stem from the book-
let “Operation Abolition,”
compiled at Moon's urgence
and printed by the NCC, but
“not to be construed as re-

flecting the attitudes or po-
sition of the National Council
of Churches of Christ in the
United States of America.”

It is a fair question to ask
whether this is responsible
journnalism on the part of
No. 51's editor. It is also fair
to ask just who is brainwash-
ing whom, though perhaps it
was just a tough weekend.

1 really can see nothing
wrong with introducing an
element of opinion into our
non - partisan announcement
sheet, | suppose, except that
it is biased against my point
of view—which view is no-
thing so richly dramatic as
claiming HUAC to be the
savior of a world attacked by
@ radical National Council of
Churches, but simply e plea
not to substitute opinion,
whether of eminent clergy
or of undergraduste Hetter
writers, for fact in the many
questions where facts are
applicable and readily obtain-
able.

But this demands more

‘than a weekly glance at the
Charlotte Obeserver and the
up-and-coming Announce-
ments.

It means reading the Na-
tion and the National Guard.
ian as well as National Re-
view and Human Events, and
even some reports of ‘‘nasty”
congressional committees;
and for us it also means
having an educational end
beyond the accumulation of
semester hours and quality
points—in short, it demands
that we practice the liberty
we wish to preserve.

it would amuse me if it
were not so tragic to see stu-
dents who in their sophistica-
tion, will howl down the
Bible literalist, yet will gird
their loins and face issues
of utmost concern, standing
resolutely on one magazine’s
opinion.

An editor has every right
to believe what he will, but
he does not have the right to
profess himself a champion
of unrestricted truth unless
he is.

If we wake up one morn-
ing to find the Bill of Rights
efficiently torn up and
thrown in our faces it will be
the doings not of the beard-
ed, wild-eyed man standing
on a soap box in the slums,
a bomb in one hand, a red
flag in the other, shouting
“Komes the Revolution,” nor
of the julep-sipping isola-
tionist, but of precisely this
kind of blurry-eyed editor
and of his none-too-sober (i.e.
uninformed) public.

Dear Anne,

I thought I had been to all the top drawer schools
until I went to Davidson College. Dabney Longstreet
(of the upper state Longstreets, you remember Suzy
Longstreet from camp) asked me up. Dabney is pres-
ident of the school social committee, and of course was
mighty busy much of the weekend, but we still had a
wonderful time. He was the gracious and obliging
gentleman one would expect a Longstreet to be.

I wrote home to MaMa and discovered that she knew
Dabney’s MaMa well as both of them are chief state
U. D. C. committeewomen. It’s suprising that I haven’t
seen the Longstreets at Sea Island, since they have a
house there. ,

Needless to say, I kept running into so many wonder-
ful people that we know (George Beckenridge of Co-
lumbia, Mary Lee Pickett of Georgetown, for instance).
Did you miss the Cup? Oh, my goodness, I did too. Hope
to see you at the Island when school’s out, though.

Lots of love,
Tootsie

Hi Ya!

How's the second sharpest girl in the world! I'm
shafting Kennybaby to hit Davidson for the first time.

Wouldn't be going if you weren’t going to be there. I
guarantee you, Sue, that damn monastery isn’t the
Carolina Deke house!! But ’'m supposed to have a date
with one of the few really smooth people there. AIN’T
SHARP ENOUGH!!!

You know what his father does? I'll tell you what

his father does. He’s president of a trucking company,
that’s all! NOTHING BUT MONEY!! Met him at the
PiKa party during the deb ball. (Love those PiKa’s!)
Just got to be the best dancer I’ve ever seen, if he
manages to stay on his. feet, ha! ha! Well, keep the
pledge till I see you.

Dear Diary,

This has been the best weekend of my life. I went
to a college dance with a third year college student.
He was in one of those fraternities that has parties
which would make our office shin-dig look like a Jun-
ior Prom. I didn’t meet any girls I knew, but I saw a lot
of snotty college ones that I didn’t.

I was supposed to spend the night in one of the
boy’s dormitories with the other girls, but we didn’t
make it in. George was nice enough to drive me to
work the next morning. His family must be rich be-
cause he sure does get what he wants.

April 24, 1961

Dear Jane,

Please excuse the notebook paper, but if I don’t do
something in this class I'll simply go crazy.

This past weekend started off so good when we beat
Robbinsville High in baseball, and then I thought
things had just started. As I told you in my last letter
Billy invited me to Davidson College’s Spring Frolics.

Jane, I don’t know what’s happened to Billy. Pm
sure you looked up to him like I did when he was Hi-Y
President last year, but I just don’t know now. Billy
drinks. All the boys in his club drink, Even a lot of
the girls drank.

When he took me to the dance in the gym he was
the old Billy. But then we went to a dirty old place by
a river and Billy changed. He, the girls, and the colored
boys in the band got down-right ugly, in both word and
deed. My parents wouldn't let those people in our
home. Billy drank so much beer that he fell asleep and
didn't wake up, except for the one time when he got
Sick.

I was looking forward to at least ending it pleasantly
by renewing our spiritual friendship at the Westmin-
ster Fellowship, but he said, ‘“‘Hell, no, I might get
sick again.” I might add that Billy isn’t bashful any-
more... and that beautiful dress Mother made is in
shreds. OOps . . . here comes the teacher. NEVER GO
TO A COLLEGE DANCE.
