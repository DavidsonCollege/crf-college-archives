Tonight At 8:30

Miss Susan Reed. the South
Carolina native who put the zither
into the masses’ music vocabulary,
will appear in concert tonight at
8:30 in Chambers Auditorium, the
second standott in the Musie De-

in that she will be accom-
panied by three musicians from

As a rule, she sings her ballads
accompanied only by herself on the

zither, harp, or a little hite-like
instrument which she calls the
“ever-lovin’.” Tonight, however,

Mrs. Harold Frantz om the violin
Mrs. Kenneth Moore on the cello,
and Mr. Kenneth Moore on the

tions.

DOUG RICE . . hero, athlete, stud manager

By MAYNARD BELLAMY, JR.
He has had more than his share of hard luck, yet fortitude,
stamina, and just plain guts have pulled him through. In the
Air Force he was shot down over Berlin and went through

untold — suffering including the
Death March in Getmany when
8000 prisoners were marched up
and down the country. The Ger-
mans were about through bat they
tried to kee their prisoners from
being liberated as long as possible.

Football Injuries

While at Davidson he was active
in campus life and on the football
field he was a hard-luck guy who
wouldn't say quit even though he
was plagued by serious injuries.
_Boug Rice is originally from
Vennettesville, South Carolina.
After completing high. schoo! he
served thirty-four months in the
Army Air Force as a belly gun-
ner on B-17's.

Nine Captured

Two months after the invasion
of France his plane was shot down
over Berlin and its nine crew
members were captured,

First, the Germans took them
to a lot of big cities and showed
them the damage the Yank bomb-
ers had done. Doug said that they
had really messed up the place.
Then thirty-six prisoners, including
Doug, were sent to the border of
France to start a new prison there.

When the Americans drove
across France two weeks later,
they were literally stuffed into
boxcars, fifty-three to a car.

Faculty Policy
On Student Hops

What are the off-campus dance
rules at Davidson?

The faculty has the trustees’ per-
mission at the present to rule on
off-campus dances held by frater-
nities and other student groups,
It is their policy to ask student
leaders to hold all dances here
after receiving many petitions from
parents, alumni and.’ students to
limit off-campus functions held in
a different environment from that
of the college.

It was also complained that ex-
cessive and dangerous driving was
involved in attending off-campus
dances,

None Here Until 1941

Overall social rules are made by
the trustees and it was not until
1941 that the on-campus ban was
lifted under the request of the
faculty’ wha saw no reason for the
dances to be held legally in Char-
lottte, but not here.

When the rule was changed the
trustees stated that dances conld
be held here at the discretion of
the faculty and with their chap-
eronage.

Only One Request

Since the construction of the
Johnston Gym, only one request
has been made to hold an off-

Actual construction of the Stu-
dent Union will get under way
next week. So far as Thompson and
Street, the conttactors, can s€e,
there should be no serious inter-
ruption until it is completed.

It probably will be mid-sum-
mer before the Union is ready
for use.

Superseding last week's David-
sonian report, it is now fairly clear
that the date fog the completion
of the new church cannot be ex-
pected earlier than April. Kormer-
ly January | had been set as the
probable opening date.

The contractors will be de-
layed until toward the end of
February, after which the
placing of the organ, pews, car-
pets, etc., will require several
weeks.

The Administration said it still
hoped that the Baccalaureate sorv-
ice at the next Commencement can

Cartoon,

Contest Slated

On the heels of their Monday
announcement of the annual Fresh-
man Writing Contest, Scripts 'N
Pranks editor Jim Fickeisen  re-
vealed this morning plans for a
cartoon contest—open to all stu-
dents—with a deadline of Novem-
ber 13.

Fickeisen stressed the fact
that the cartoon contest, first
of its kind for the humor maga-
zine, was not confined to the
freshman class but was open
to upperclassmen as well.

“lt was sort of a spur of the mo-
ment decision,” Fick confided, “but
there. are virtually two. weeks be-
fore the deadline. The prize of $5.00
won't keep anyone in India ink
for life, but we'll undoubtedly get
a good cross-section of this student
body's humor wit put forth in some
pretty good cartoons.”

The Scripts 'N Pranks sug-
gests that drawings be done on
paper approximately six by
eight inches in size. Efforts
should be turned into Fickeisen
in 133 Duke, the editorial staff
serving as judges.

As announced in the fall edition
of the magazine which appeared
eatlier this week, the Freshman
Writing Contest is officially open
now, with deadline December 11.

Ante Upped

The ante is upped to $10 for the
best effort from fledgling writers,
who also are to turn their copy in
to 133 Duke. Again, the editorial
staff of Scripts 'N Pranks will serve
as judges. The winning selection
will be. run in the March or
Spring issue. Any form of. writing
is permissable.
