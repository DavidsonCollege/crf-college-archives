THE DAVIDSONIAN

ELECTION ‘92

MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1992

Smith

Continued from page 5

Smith: First of all, I don’t feel I’d
have a problem with any of the
three candidates running. I know
all of them very well and I’ve
worked extensively with two of
them. I think that there’s a delicate
balance and the Vice-President
needs to support the President but
also really needs to challenge the
President in a lot of ways.

I think the Vice-President
ought to do that on a confidential
basis with the President and then
they should get together, exchange
views and then put.them together
in the Senate meeting.

Davidsonian: The new black fra-
ternity on campus is all but a real-
ity.

How do you think we should
treat the BSC? Is it in danger of
having its power or influence
diminished?

Smith: Let me correct your ques-
tion first. It’s not a “black” frater-
nity; it’s an historically black fra-
ternity. I think that it’s a very posi-
tive step for Davidson.

I don’t think that the BSC’s
power will be diminished at all. I
think the African-American stu-
dents here need an alternative to
the social life. There are a lot of
frustrated A frican-Americans here.
That was one important topic
brought up at the racial tensions
forum setup by Linsey Mills in the
fall.

Davidsonian: What sort of con-
crete plans or ideas do you have for
easing these racial tensions?

Smith: One is more work with
freshman orientation. The present
system of dealing with racial and
ethnic differences is insufficient.
One thing that CoMA is doing this
weck is we were going around
talking toevery freshman hall about
racial tension. It’s going to be an
open discussion group.

That sort of thing, education,
isreally the answer. One of the real
problems is that a lot of people
don’t believe that ‘racial tension
exists on this campus. Our goal is
to educate the college more about
that.

Andrew

_Spainhour

My name is Andrew Spain-
hour, and I’m running for SGA
Vice-President. Over the past few

“years, I’ve doneanumber of things

at Davidson that in one way or
another reflect my personality -
I’ve served on a number of com-
mittees, written for thisnewspaper
as wellas previously having served
on its editorial board, been a
member of CCRL, and worked as
a hall counselor. During my time
here, I’ve followed the workings
of the SGA with great interest, and
each year, I’veconsidered running.

_Last year, I chose, after much de-

liberation , to concentrate on being
a good hall counselor. Now, I feel
it is my time to make a bid for
SGA. The office of the Vice-Presi-
dent interests me the most, in that
I feel that its responsibilities fit
well with my talents and abilities.
I consider myself to be approach-
able, responsible, and a good judge
ofcharacter, traits which are cru-
cial to the effective execution of
this job, in which some 15 commit-
tees and committee chairs fall under
the auspices of the Vice-Presi-
dency. Additionally, I feel that I
would, and could be an extremely
valuable resource for the SGA
President, as well as_ the entire
Senate.at large. I freely recog-
nize that having never served on
the Senate may be seen by some to
be adifficulty. I disagree. I know
well the workings of Davidson and
my ume on CCRL has taught mea
gredt deal about student govern-
mentand leadership. Perhaps most
importantly, I want to do this job
because I feel that SGA has the
potential for achieving greatness
in the coming year, and I'd like to
be a part of it. There’s a lot to be
done, and I feel that I have the
vision, the willingness, the seri-
ousness, and the sense of humor to
help Davidson achieve its greatest
potenual.

Davidsonian: Earlier in the year,
there wasa great deal of discussion
about the effectiveness of the
Honor Council and its status on
campus. Some see the fact that the
Council functions both as judge
and jury as detrimental. How do
you respond?

Spainhour: It's aconcern on the
part of everyone. It may be per-
ceived to be an elitist organization,
and I am glad that the SGA has
studied this. I fear that we may not
have heard a great enough voice
from the SGA, and it was perhaps
passed on a little too quickly to the
Student Conduct Council.

I think there still needs to be
some study, and I hope that the
debate will continue.

Davidsonian: What exactly are
the areas where the SGA has the
most potential for growth and
benefit?

Spainhour: | think that the SGA:is
a great voice to address the prob-
lems that we’ve had on this cam-
pus. All you have to do is pick up
anewspaper, and you see that there
is an amount of intolerance which
is unacceptable.

I think that the SGA can ad-
dress this more than it has, and I
find that to be the area of greatest
potential, in that we make Davidson
aless harsh and more tolerantplace
to be.

Davidsonian: Where have you

really led the way around this
school?

Spainhour: As a member of the
CCRL and a Hall Counselor, I
along with a few other students
decided that something was hap-
pening within the Freshman class
that was not acceptable. People
were. not being able to mect other
freshmen, as they felt too greatly
the pressures of rush.

It was a concern of mine and it
was a concern of these other Hall
Counselors, and we led the way in
changing the policy. We were the
one to tell Deal Terry that some-
thing had to be done. While I’m
not sure that the exactly correct
measures were taken, I along with
a few others led the way in trying to
make the life of Freshmen less
stressful.

In writing for the newspaper,
I’ve tried toexpressa point of view
and share it with others, and I’ve
tried to lead that way.

Steven Summers

During my time asa student at
Davidson College, Ihave been very
active in the Student Government
Association. My concentration in
the SGA has been in student com-
mittees and councils set up for
students to help in all areas of
campus life. These committees
and councils, with the help of stu-
dents and faculty, allow the SGA
to make firm recommendations to
the Trustees. Because these com-
mittees have been hard-working
and thorough, the Trustees have
taken the recommendations very
seriously. During the past three
years, Ihave been a member of the
Security and Public Safety Com-
mittee, the Campus Services
Committee, and I am presently the
Chairman of the Auxiliary Serv-

- ices Council. As Chairman of the

Auxiliary Services Council, I have
learned how financial decisions that
have been made by the Director of
Auxiliary Services. By serving on
these committees, I have learned
what specific improvements are
needed, and I have had the oppor-
tunity to make recommendations
to the SGA. I have decided to run
for SGA Vice-President because
this position will enable me to
further organize and improve the
committees and councils which the
SGA sponsors. I understand the
purpose as well as the importance
and significance of each of these
committees. Also, I feel that] have
the experience and background to
organize and administrate these
committees in a very successful
manner, As Vice-President, I

--would also concentrate on work-

ing with the President of the SGA,
students, faculty, administrators,
and the Trustees. Because of my
close relationship with these im-
portant groups, I feel that I will be
able to make important changes to
benefit our community.

Some issues which currently

_ are very important include the

Minus Grading System, Admis-
sions, Security and Public Safety,
Athletics, the Honor Council, and
the Alcohol Policy. Although my
opinion on the new minus grading
system may be very similar to most
people’s, I have a unique interest
in pursuing the effects of the new
system. I understand the com-
plaints people remarked about the
minus grading system, and their
concerns are certainly valid.
However,:I-do not think that we
should throw the new grading
system in the trash just yet. Of
course, many students believe that
the new system has hurt their
GPA. While this may be true for
some students, other students
commented that the minus system
was beneficial because it allowed
them to get a B- rather than a C+.
Under the new system, some pro-
fessors have had greater flexibility
in assessing a student’s perform-
ance. While I would take into
consideration individual opinions,
I feel that itis important to reexam-
ine the grading system, and deter-
mine whether itcreates advantages
or disadvantages for students. I
believe that the new system de-
serves a very serious review,and
possibly some changes for im-
provement.

While the Admissions Office
has made great improvements in
the past several years since, I feel
that Davidson should enroll more
International and A frican-Ameri-
can students. These students do
not only provide a greater diver-
sity of minds at Davidson, but they
also contribute to the social diver-
sity that is essential to Davidson’ s
success. I know that a greater
effort to bring minority students to
Davidson would enable our school
to continue to enrich the learning
environment which is so valued in
our small college community.

Security and Public Safety is a
growing part of our everyday life.
Davidson has just recently con-
fronted these concerns, and has
made some improvements. The

installation of the new call-boxes,

the student escorts, and the em-
ployment of more Police Officers
has improved security, I feel that
the campus needs better lighting
and the students need better pro-
tection. Because the crime rate has
soared in Northern Mecklenburg
County, Davidson needs to ensure
that the students and the college
community areas safe as possible.
Ray Thrower, the Chief of Public
Safety, and his staff have made
great improvements over the past
several years, and I would cer-
tainly support his ideas in order to
make our community a safer place,

Although I am not a varsity
athlete at Davidson, I feel that it is
very important to address certain
athletic issues. I support Terry
Holland’s effort to place Davidson
athletics in a position that benefits
the College most. He needs stu:
dent support as well as support
from the faculty. Certainly, stu-

dent-athletes provide a link be-
tween the high academic and ath-
letic communities at Davidson. If
strong support is given to the Ath-
letic Program, and given especially
to the student-athletes, I think
Davidson will become a stronger
institution.

One issue that the Honor
Council has been asked to con-
sider isa “‘jury-trial” format. While
it is not certain that the Honor
Council’s policy will change, I
think it is important for Freshman
Orientation to include a “Mock
Trial.” I believe that the “mock
trial” will help the Freshmen under-
stand what the HonorCouncil does,
and how important the process and
policies are to Davidson.

There will always be drinking
at every college and university
regardless of its size or reputation
as an academic institution. Al-
though the Trustees and admini-
stration have proposed drastic
changes in the Alcohol Policy, Ido
not think that the solution is to
make Davidson a dry campus. A
dry campus would bring about
more drinking and driving acci-
dents, and may even promote more
irresponsible behavior. I feel that
a compromise must be made be-
tween the students and the Trus-
tees that will allow for the students
to handle themselves responsibly,
as well as avoiding alcohol infrac-
tions. It is so very important that
this compromise be made, espe-
cially because it will insure the
safety of the students, as well as to ’
protect the Trustees and admini-
stration of Davidson College.

There is a tremendous oppor-
tunity for Davidson College to
make some very important deci-
sions in the next year. I feel that if
I am elected as the’SGA Vice-
President, I will be of vital impor-
tance to the successful implemen-
tation of those decisions. I’believe
1 am uniquely qualified to pursue
the needs and concerns of the stu-
dent body while maintaining a
working, open relationship with
the SGA President, SGA Senators,
students and the administration.
Finally, I acknowledge that
Davidson has provided opportu-
nites for me that would have never
been available at a larger school,
and I believe that as the next SGA
Vice-President, I would offer my
experience, organization, and ideas
to the Student Body. » }

Davidsonian: What other roles
have you played on campus. that
might prepare you for the job of
SGA vice-president? ©

Summers: I'm the catering man-
ager at the Commons, and that
allows. me to organize all of the
functions there,

Idon’treally characterize that
as an SGA trait, but I do in that in
forces me to organize myself, and
to be able to select good people for
the jobs.

I’m also the president of the
choir, and I’m the head Resident
Advisor. That job has allowed me
to show a lot of leadership. and let
me interact with all types of stu-
dents on campus, black, white,
international, whatever.
