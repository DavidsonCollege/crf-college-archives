Young Wilcats poised to challenge for SoCon title

By WILL RoBeRsoN
Sports Editor

Since advancing to the NCAA Tourna-
ment in 1998, the Davidson Wildcats have
recorded an impressive 21-11 record in con-
ference play, but have been unable to win a
SoCon tournament game. This season, the
Wildcats revert to the unfamiliar role as the

‘ hunter after wearing a bull’s eye on their back
for much of the 1990s.

That suits coach Bob McKillop just fine. -
“Looking forward to this year, it’s easy to
focus on the fact that we have four seniors
gone,” McKillop told a recent gathering at
River Run. “You hear what is said in the
newspapers and the internet and the talk
around town--they say this is going to be a

‘rebuilding’ year.”

“Well, let me tell you something about this
group,” the 12"- ne |
year Wildcat ©
coach said with Pt,
a glimmer in
eye, “They’ve i
taken that on as
the biggest chal-
lenge in their
lives.”

phy will depend on junior center Martin Ides
and sophomore forwards Jason Dickens,
Michel Lusakueno and Chris Pearson.

“We're not going to
change our philoso-
phy,” said assistant
coach Matt Matheny.
“(But) we will make
some adjustments.”

“All four will have
an equal opportunity
for playing time. Who-
ever produces will be
on the floor.”

All four have shown |
flashes of brilliance in
the pre-season. Ides
has shown a dramatic §
increase in his quick-
ness, mobility and per-
haps most impor- ®
tantly, his confi- §
dence. Dickens
continues to pro-’
vide aVersatile in- @
side/outside op-
tion for the Wild-
cats as a post
player that can
step out and hit the jump shot as well.
Lusakueno has added an array of post
moves to the raw athleticism that earned
him increased playing time towards the
end of.last season. Pearson, a red-shirt
sophomore, has developed a potent
jumper to add to his uncanny shot-block-
ing ability and defensive presence.

As a whole, the group is virtually un-
tested in game situations, but will be
counted upon to contribute heavily this
season.

The Perimeter

Red-shirt junior Emeka Erege will
surely be a welcome sight on the hard-
wood this season, returning after sitting
out last season recovering from injury.

He adds a missing dimension to the Wildcat
attack: a slashing wing player with an natural
ability to score and rebound. Co-captain
- with Erege is fellow
junior Michael Bree.
Bree earned the start-
ing point guard posi-
tiona year ago andcon-
tributed a team-high
115 assists.
Sophomore guard
Wayne Bernard returns
after his SoCon All-
Freshman season a year
ago. Bernard will be
looked to as
more of a
leader this sea-
son, both with
hisscoringand 3
his defense.
Also seeing }
playing time in
the backcourt
for the Wild-
cats will be
junior Fern
Tonella and
sophomore
Peter Anderer. Tonella started 19
games at the point a year ago and is
especially effective and pushing the
ball in transition. Anderer, a pure
shooter from New York City, has
impressed in the pre-season with the
improvements in his all-around
game.

Two new additions to the Wildcat
roster are freshmen Nick Booker and Jouni
Eho. Booker, a 6-5 guard from Oceanside,
California, is finally able to compete after
recovering from a foot injury. Eho, a 6-6
guard/forward from Finland, has looked sharp
in the pre-season, showing off a deadly jump
shot and an innate toughness developed dur-
ing a year in the Finnish Army.

Rounding out the Wildcat squad are three

walk-ons, sophomore 7 arred Cochran and
freshmen Jason Ford and McKinley Glover.
All three will be looked to provide depth and
defensive pressure at both guard positions.

The Schedule

The Wildcats once again are faced with one
of the toughest schedules in the country. The
Cats open up as part of an underrated field at
the Top of the World Classic in Fairbanks,
Alaska. Davidson’s first round match-up is
the South Florida Bulls, a team that Athlon
Sport’s College Basketball Preview predicts
to advance to the Sweet 16.

The Wildcats return to the contiguous forty-
eight states witha
trip to Atlanta to
face Georgia
Tech on Novem-
ber 24. Wildcat
fans will be
treated to a great
game on Novem-
ber 28 as Penn, the
favorite to win the
Ivy League, visits
Belk Arena.

After a trip to
Elon, Davidson
ventures into
Cameron Indoor
Stadium for the
second straight
year to face the
Duke Blue Devils
on December 5.
On December 9,
Charlotte will
make the trip across Mecklenburg County.

Two Division III games hold the team
through finals and the winter holidays before
atrip to The Pit in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
to compete in the Lobo Classic held at the
University of New Mexico on December 29
and 30.

College of Charleston is the clear favorite in the Southern Conference

By WILL RoBERSON
Sports Editor

The new year brings with it the beginning
of the Southern Conference slate. Here’s a
preview of the competition facing the Wild-
cats in the 2001 SoCon season.

North Division

UNC-Greensboro:

Coming off their first winning season since
1995-96, the Spartans have high hopes for the
new season. The UNC-G backcourt is tal-
ented and experienced, returning three double-
figure scorers including point guard Courtney
Eldrige (11.2 ppg), guard Nathan Jameson
(10.7 ppg), and 6-6 wing forward James
Maye (13.4 ppg, 5.9 rpg). The Spartans add
6-8 junior David Schuck, the WAC’s 5th-°
leading rebounder at Air Force as a sopho-
more, and 7-2 redshirt freshman center Nathan
Popp in the frontcourt.

Appalachian State:

After representing the Southern Confer-
ence in the NCAA Tournament a year ago,
the Mountaineers had one of the worst sum-
mers imaginable. SoCon MVP Tyson
Patterson graduated, coach Buzz Peterson
left for a job at Tulsa, and leading scorer
Rufus Leach drowned in a boating accident.
This leaves a lot’ of responsibility on the
shoulders of the two returning starters, guard
Shawn Alexander and center Cory Cooper.
Role players a year ago, both will be looked
to for increased scoring, rebounding, and
leadership.

East Tennessee State:

The Bucs return four starters from last '

year’s 14-15 team, including leading return-
ing scorer D.J. McDuffie, a 6-2 senior guard.
One thing ETSU lacks is height, which may

lead to 6-9 freshman Cory Seels sliding into _

the starting center position. Forward Adrian
Meeks will be looked to for post offense and
rebounding after averaging 9 points and 7
rebounds a game last season.

Western Carolina:

Former Davidson assistant coach Steve
Shurina inherits a Catamount team decimated
by transfer and graduation. SoCon freshman
of the year Jarvis Hayes and his twin brother
Jonas left for Georgia, and forward Dondrell
Whitmore (13.1 ppg, 7.6 rpg) graduated.
Point guard Casey Rogers led the league in
assists last season, but has very few options
to pass to in 2000-01.

Virginia Military Institute:

The Keydets will look to rebound after
losing 211 of their last 22 games last year and
finishing a miserable 6-23 overall. There is
hope however, with all-conference candi-
date Nick Richardson (12 ppg), guard Rich-
ard Bruee (9.4 ppg) and 6-9 center Eric Mann
(7.3 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 1.8 bpg) returning. All
three are seniors and will be counted on to
lead the Keydets in the 2000-2001 season.

South Division

College of Charleston:

The Cougars, the consensus pick to win the
SoCon championship, return all five starters
from a year ago. Leading the way is center
Jody Lumpkin, the pre-season conference
player of the year. Lumpkin averaged 15

points and 9 rebounds a game last season.
Also returning for C of C is swingman Jeff
Bolton, an all-conference performer a year
ago, averaging 15.6 points and 4.5 rebounds.
James Griffin, in his second year with the
Cougars after transferring from Wake Forest
returns at the scoring guard position. For-
ward Leighton Bowie made the SoCon All-
Freshman team last year, and incoming fresh-
man Thomas Mobley has-been described as
having “ACC talent.” Charleston invades
Belk Arena February 24 in.a game that will
be broadcast on ESPN2.

Georgia Southern:

The Eagles are coming off their first above-
.500 season since 1992-93, and return an
impressive inside-outside duo in guard Julius
Jenkins and forward Kashien Latham.
Jenkins averaged 15.5 points per game as a
freshman last year, and Latham is coming off
a season where he scored 12.8 points and
grabbed 7.5 rebounds per contest. Incoming
point guard Sean Peterson is expected to
contend for all-conference status after star-
ring at the JUCO level a year ago.

Wofford:

Guard Ian Chadwick returns to the Terri-
ers lineup as the league’s top returning scorer:
(16.8 ppg), and with a chance to shatter the
SoCon record for career 3-pointers.
Chadwick will desperately miss his side-
kick Starzee Walker, but the emergence of
point guard Jon Pryor (4.8 ppg, 3.5 apg) will
help soften the blow.

Furman:
- After a very unimpressive regular season,
the Paladins won twice in the SoCon tourna-

ment before losing a close 60-56 game to
eventual champion App. State. Returning to
lead the 2000-01 team is sophomore Karim
Sochu, who averaged a solid 15.8 ppg and 7.4
rebounds per game as a freshman. Other
starters returning are PG Guilherem Da Luz (5
apg), guard Anthony Thomas (9.5 ppg), and
forward Marcus Diligard (7. 3 ppg).

Chattanooga:

The Mocs will look to player of the year
candidate Oliver Morton for a majority of
their scoring and rebounding. A 6-10 center,
Morton averaged 12.8 points and 6.8 rebounds
last season. UTC welcomes eight new players
to their roster, including Neil Ashby, a 6-8
forward transfer from Alabama and Clyde
McCully, a point guard JUCO transfer.

The Citadel; —

The Bulldogs return all sieven lettermen
from last season’s 9-20 team. The conferences
most accurate 3-point threat is junior Alan
Puckett. Despite not graduating any players
last season, the young roster still includes but
one senior.
