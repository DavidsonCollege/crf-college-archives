Survey shows students
hesitant about sororities

By Lex! HAMILTON
Senior Staff Writer

In a recent survey conducted by
Associate Professor of Political
Science Patrick Sellers, 45 percent
of participants responded that
Davidson should not have sorori-
ties on campus.

Thirty-one percent responded
that sororities should be allowed on
campus, and the remainder was
undecided.

The survey, which was conduct-
ed by email, had a total of 553 par-
ticipants.

Supporters of the sorority tended
to be male; supporters also tended
to be non-white.

According to Sellers, however,
the sample size was too small to
make the multivariate comparison
that supporters tended to be non-
white males.

The results of the survey have
caused organizers of the effort to
bring a historically black sorority
to Davidson to double their efforts
to secure student support.

“It’s not enough just to tell
Davidson students where they may
search to find information on this
type of sorority,” organizer
Whitney White ’08 said. “This
knowledge has to be directly acces-
sible.”

Although the Patterson Court
Council (PCC) returned a 24-2
vote in support of the historically
black sorority on October 24, the
survey suggests that not all stu-

dents support the efforts to bring
the sorority to campus.

Organizer Ashley Moore ’07,
however, believes that the wording
of the sorority question was what
caused many students to respond
negatively.

“The survey -question did not
specifically ask whether students
supported the historically black
sorority,’ Moore said, “which
means that a lot of the survey par-
ticipants may have responded ‘no’
or ‘unsure’ because of their aver-
sion to the traditional female Greek
system.”

Yet one student independent of
an eating house said, “I think that
the sorority will fill a need that
Patterson Court does not meet.

Unfortunately, from what I’ve .

heard from some of my friends in
gating houses, it seems that the ini-
tial presentations at the houses
were not terribly clear on the orga-
nization’s purpose, and those early
misunderstandings hurt their cam-
paign.” .

Moore and the other organizers
recognize that there is still resist-
ance to the sorority on campus and
plan to use the results of the survey
to refocus their campaign for cam-
pus support. .

“We understand that the survey
does reflect that a portion of the
campus is still uncertain about the
goals of a historically black organ-
ization,” White said, “and we will

Impromptu party rule.

upsets Court members

By KATIE PFEIFFER
Senior Staff Writer

Recent changes to the Davidson
College alcohol policy have caused
problems among eating houses and
fraternities with a rule that limits
Patterson Court to two weekday
registered parties per week.
Although this rule has been in
place for years, many students are
questioning its relevance and feel
that Patterson Court is being cen-
sored unnecessarily.

“I feel like Davidson, while
doing a good job enforcing North
Carolina state laws, takes alcohol
too seriously,” said Sam Hotchkiss
°08, who is unaffiliated with a
Patterson Court organization.

Changes to the alcohol policy
require houses’ to _ register
impromptu parties, which are held
on weekdays, with Campus Safety
and decreased the number of peo-
ple at a gathering that requires a
risk manager to 30. At issue is the
change in the definition of “regis-
tered party,” which has evolved
from its past meaning of a planned
event whose organizers expect a
crowd, and the need to register
unplanned parties when the atten-
dance is 30, instead of 40, a change
that covers many more weekday
gatherings.

Since only two registered parties
can take place during the week, a
house planning to hold a registered
event may find other houses are
vying for one registration slot.

Additionally, if an impromptu
that was not expected to require a
risk manager exceeds capacity, it
will either have to be broken up or
get a risk manager if the two-party
limit has already been reached.

Due to academic and extracur-
ricular commitments, weekday
gatherings often attract fewer peo-
ple, often not enough to warrant
registering the event. Despite this,
weekday parties are still popular.

“Weekend parties are huge and
draw students from all houses,
whereas the weekday parties tend
to be more a low-key bonding
experience for individual houses
and are way more laid back and
intimate than anything that hap-
pens on the weekend,” Warner
president Alice Neumann ’06 said.

In order to protect houses from
disciplinary action and provide suf-
ficient safety preparations, students
must register impromptus.

The limit on the number of
weekday parties has not been an
issue in the past.

“I did not need to enforce the

Young Life approved as a
student organization

By ADAM MARTIN
News Editor Emeritus

Davidson College recently
approved the request of Young Life
(YL) to become a student organiza-
tion after questions regarding
whether or not the organization
meets the college’s policy of non-
discrimination. YL is a national
Christian organization that recruits
college student leaders to meet
with high school students in the
surrounding area. Eight Davidson
students currently serve as YL
leaders.

Emily Smith ’06 participated in
YL in high school and has been a
leader since her first year at
Davidson. She described YL as a

Warner not to be caught disarmed again

“relational, incarnational ministry,
which thrives on building relation-
ships with high school kids and
loving them just where they are, no
matter where they are, because
Christ has first loved us.”

The Davidson policy that has
troubled YL, as well as InterVarsity
Christian Fellowship, in the past is
the College’s “non-discrimination”
clause, which says that member-
ship in student organizations “must
be open to any individual regard-
less of race, color, sexual orienta-
tion, religion, creed, nationality,
ancestry, disability, or gender
(except where appropriate and per-
mitted by law).”

Counseling
Center usage
increases

By JILLIAN BARTELS
Staff Writer

In the past few years,
Davidson’s Student Counseling
Center (SCC) has experienced
an increase in the number of
students who seek treatment for
mental health issues. Davidson
now has one of the highest
counseling center participation
rates in the country.

Statistics show that about 20
percent of. the student body
seeks help during. any given
academic year and that about 45
percent of graduating seniors
report having gone to the SCC
at least once.

According to SCC Director
David Staton, there are many
causes for the increased number
of students seeking help.

“More students are arriving
at college who have already
used counseling in the past or
are currently on psychotropic
medications,” Staton — said.
“Many ‘such students might not
have been able to achieve col-
lege admission or admission to
the colleges they’ ve chosen had
it not been for such earlier sup-
port. Many then need additional
similar support once in college
to continue their raised achieve-
ment levels.”

Staton also said the increase
could be related to students
being “failure-phobic” and not
realizing failure is a part of life.

Students most frequently
report __ problems with

stress/anxiety, depression, aca-
demics, and relationships.
