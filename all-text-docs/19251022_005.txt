E College and Its Effect
on Religion is Subject
for Student Discussion

Weekly Discussion Groups Attract
Large Number of Students to
Wednesday Evening Meetings

At the weekly discussion group which was
held on Wednesday night at 9:30 the ques-
tion which was discussed was, “How does
college affect a man’s faith?”

Out in the very-day life of the world of
today there is much discussion on this ques-
tion, and it ‘hasyled many to think that a col-
lege training “ts not worth the risk. This
is the problem which the men of Davidson
set themselves to last night.

“A man’s religion is one of the prime fac-
tors in his life, and if a college education is
going to remove that factor, or so distort it
that it is entirely different, is it advisable to
seek the education 7”

“But does the college education always, or
even for a great part of the time, have that

the relation of a college education to the
great number of religious changes in’ the
lives of men?”

These are some of the questions which

were brought up at the meeting, and thrash-
ed out for the benefit of the men who were
present.

These discussion groups are different trom
any others which held
the Davidson campus. Formerly, it has been
the custom to have a discussion on each ot
the floors in the various dormitories. ‘This
year Roland Parker, who is in charge of this
part of the Y. M. C. A. work, adopted the
plan of having two of the professors lead

Delta Pi Kappa Frat to
Petition National Order

Local Journalistic Fraternity Plans
To Petition National Association

The Delta Pi Kappa, an honorary journal-
istic fraternity, met last week for the purpose
of promoting newspaper activities for the
coming year, and also to consider plans for
petitioning a national journalistic fraternity.
No definite action was taken in regard to
such a petition.

The new home for this organization is in
the honorary fraternity house on Concord
Avenue, where all meetings and discussions
relative to journalistic work will be held.
Plans are on foot to give the members an
opportunity to hear several eminent news-
paper writers, who will give a number of
lectures at different times during the year.
These men are connected with all the promi-
nent newspapers of the state, and the fra-
ternity is fortunate in procuring such com-
petent speakers,

Only those men who show by their work
on “The Davidsonian” staff and Reporters’
Club that their achievements merit it are
considered for membership in the chapter.
All students are eligible provided they show
extraordinary ability along journalistic lines;
however, no bids will be extended this fall.

The present members of Delta Pi Kappa
are: C.F, Smith, R. B. Parker, C. F. Monk,
G. M. Eddington, A. Y. Bowie and W. E.
Milton, of the Senior class. The members
from the Junior Class are W. H.
L. D. Wharton and P. F. Jones.

Dr. C. F. Meyers
to Lead Revival

It has been noted in the past few years
that the evangelistic services have been a
great success. This success is due in a large
measure to the speakers and to the students

who have shown a great interest in the
meetings.
This year plans are being made for a

series of meetings better, even, than those
held during previous years. Dr. C. F. Myers,
pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in

meetings will be Held in Shearer Hall on

Coach Monk Younger, however, put a dif-

plays carried it on down the field, aided by
two offside penalties for five yards each on
P. C., until Black shoved the pigskin across
for a touchdown,

Several minutes later Lucien Wells inter-
cepted a pass on P. C.’s 47-yard line, return-
ing it four time the
Wildcats started a straight march for the
goal line. Twenty-eight yards of this came
in two plays, Grey clipping off 13 yards
around end, and when it was third down and
five yards to go Hewlette sent Wells through
the center of the line for 15 yards, and a
touchdown, which was another thrilling event.
Laird for the first time this season failed to
kick extra point after the second touchdown.

The cog in the Presbyterian College ma-
chine that kept the score down considerably
was Kirven, center. He was making tackles,
right, left and straight ahead, and was easily
the star of the P. C. team. His passing to
the backs was off somewhat, but he made up
for that in his tackling. Stevens was large-
ly responsible for the few gains around end,
nabbing the players almost every time they
attempted to circle his end.

Grey and Stamps had a battle Saturday.
Each of these men kicked 17 the
average for Stamps being 40 yards, and for
Grey 44 yards. While Stamps sent three
punts down the field for over 50 yards, Grey
registered one for 76 yards, two for 60 yards,
and one for 55 yards. Grey was outclassed
when kicking against the wind, and in this
respect Stamps excelled. However, Grey
did send the ball over the goal line for 60
yards on the kick-off against the wind.

Wells was again a feature for Davidson,
Hewlette calling upon him time and time
again to carry the ball. He received a 30-
yard pass, intercepted another one, returned
a punt for 35 yards, and drive over the P. C.
for 15 yards and a touchdown, in addition to
gaining other ground.

In the line Bohannon and Vance were
features, the former showing alacrity in get-
ting down the field under punts, twice nailing
the receiver in his tracks. Vance was play-
ing his usual steady game, being better in
|the last half. Ritchie smeared the line sev-

kicked. In three plays Davidson 'made first
down, and a second first down was registered
a few moments later when a pass, Grey to
Wells, was completed for 30 yards. These
were the only two first downs for Davidson
that half. After several plays Laird at-
tempted a place kick, but failed, the wind
