Iles and Stuart Dorsett took the
senatorial positions.

Class senator races, particu-
larly in the freshman class,
which had ten candidates, and
the CCRL race, with nine

candidates, were the most

. crowded. After Tuesday’s vot-

ing, the top four candidates in
these two races went on to
run-offs Wednesday, with three
candidates elected in each race.

On Tuesday, juniors Rob
Hull and Tim Stoll won the
election for student solicitor,

Kaylor fears that apathy thréatens India Semester Program

By MARK BARRETT
Asst. News Editor

Despite a “‘very encouraging”’
grant from the U.S. Office of
Education, the first session of
Davidson and UNCC’s Semes-
ter in India may be canceled for
lack of students.

According to Religion Profes-
sor David Kaylor, the four
month program has received
only eleven applications to date,
and just one from: a Davidson
student.

The program will consist of
preliminary readings, a two
week orientation period at
UNCC, ten and one-half weeks

of study at Madras University
(located in the city of Madras,
in southern India), four weeks
of study at historical and cultu-
ral sites across India, and two
weeks of individual travel and
study in India.

Kaylor added he hopes the
new grant, which could be up to
$30,000 depending on the num-
ber of participants in the prog-
ram, will attract more applica-
tions.

He explained the grant will
reduce the cost of the program
to students to $2,300 for the
four month period, roughly the

same amount as it costs to
attend Davidson for the same
length of time. Before the grant
was received in mid-March,
students had been told the
program would cost them ap-
proximately $3,500.

In order to allow for new
applicants, Kaylor said the
application deadline has been
reset for May 1.

Kaylor noted that if the
program cannot be held this
coming fall, the grant would be
lost, and students would likely
have to pay $3,500 in order to
attend the following year. He
said the grant could probably be

Donkey’s birthday party tradition dies on UT campus

AUSTIN, TX (CPS)—Eeyore,
the doleful donkey in A.A.
Milne’s Winnie the Pooh won't
have a birthday celebration this
year. The University of Texas
English professor who started
the annual party 15 years ago
has said, ‘‘Enough, already.”

Dr. James B. Ayres, the
professor, acquired two kegs of
beer and invited 50 friends to
Eastwoods Park (a neighbor-
hood park near the UT campus)
to share them with him one
April weekend in 1964. Some-
where along the way the party
moved to Pease Park—two
square miles of space. Last year
14,000 persons helped Dr.
Ayres consume 220 kegs of bee:
and wanted more. .

“These people not only want
something for nothing, they
want everything for nothing,”
said Dr. Ayres, as he announ-
ced that Eeyore won’t have a
birthday party this year. He
figures that if he could start the
celebration, he can stop it.

‘ He says he used to get dozens
of phone calls in February and
March offering assistance with
Eeyore’s party. This year he
has had only one such call.

Dr. Ayres’ memory is long,

too. He can’t forget last year.
After all the balloons had burst,
after all the beer had been
swigged, he was the only person
at Pease Park the next day to
clean up the mess.

Something is wrong with the
rites of spring, he says, when
pumps and kegs are stolen from
the beer suppliers, and brand-
new garbage cans furnished by
the city are crushed beyond use
after being used as drums for
unearthly ‘‘music’’.

While Dr. Ayres was out
cleaning up the park last year—
alone—he found a $20 bill.

“T felt it should be mine,” he
says, ‘‘so I put it in my
pocket.”’

Dr. Ayres is adamant that
there will be no public party
that he has anything to do with,
but ‘“‘some Friday in April I
may get some beer and sneak
out with some friends to East-
woods Park, and celebrate
spring like we used to do it.”’

Unpopular governor cancels
appearance to avoid pie

AMHERST, MA (CPS)—Mas-
sachusetts Governor Edward
King cancelled a scheduled
March 30 appearance at the
University of Massachusetts at
Amherst because he was afraid
of being hit with a pie.
‘‘Students have a right to
express themselves,’’ King ex-
plained to the press, ‘‘but it was
needless to-go up there. It’s a
long day, and we couldn’t afford
to get, pie all over our clothes.”
Two thousand students protes-
ted at the Student Union, where
King had been slated to speak,
over cuts in the state’s higher

education budget.

King is also unpopular with
the students here because of his
successful effort to raise the
drinking age in the state, and
because of his support of nuc-
lear power. Students at the rally
shouted ‘Send. King to Harris-
burg” before beginning a march
across campus, and dispersing.

In the fall of 1977, then-Gov-
ernor Michael Dukakis was pied
on the UMass-Amherst cam-
pus. It was the last time a
governor had appeared on the
campus.

retained if the program is
successful this year.

Student fees will cover all
expenses except incidents and
individual student travel.

Kaylor said he was disap-
pointed at the number of appli-
cants for the program, saying
he had ‘“‘hoped for at least two
or three applicants from David-
son, and in general, enough to
allow us to conduct the. prog-
ram.’’ He stressed, however,
that the program would be held
if at all possible, that is, if
fifteen interested students can
be found.

He said he could only specu-
late as to why the number of
applications has been so low,
but cited the primary Western
bent of American education and
the natural ‘“‘fear of the un-
known”’ as possible factors.

Kaylor said the program
should be very worthwhile and
added, ‘‘A good education
should include some exposure to
a culture other than one’s own.
Students particularly need ex-
posure to a third world country,
which the program will offer.
We often learn much about
ourselves when we encounter a
culture different from our own.

“The Indian culture is one of
the oldest continuous existing
ones in the world, and has an
extremely rich and diverse tra-
dition certainly worth close
study.”

Eglin also commented on the
bewildering number of. offices
and candidates in this election.
“I think next time somebody
should come out with some-
thing to explain what all the
different offices are so people
know what they’re voting on.”

Also, Eglin felt it would be
good “‘if somebody worked on
getting people out to vote.”

Dorsett, another newly elec-
ted freshman senator, com-
plained that the elections were
at an inopportune time, so close
to mid-terms and Spring -Fro-
lics. He said, ‘‘I really had to
push myself to campaign at
