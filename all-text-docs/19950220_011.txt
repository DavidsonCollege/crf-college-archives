Union photograph exhibit takes a look into

?

By GEORGE WELD
Art Critic for The Davidsonian

Something about the camera
and something about- American
culture have combined to establish
a tradition in photography that is
nearly unprecedented in the visual
arts: the study of marginal people.
From Edward Curtis’ famous se-
ries of photographs of Native
Americans to the work of contem-
porary photographers such as
Andre Serrano, photography has
paid more attention to the outcast,
the disadvantaged, and the over-
looked than has any other form of
art.

“The Faces of the Homeless,”
an exhibition of photographs by
Jeff Carsten, hangs in the Union
Gallery this week to celebrate Soli-
darity Week. This group of photo-

graphs partakes of this sub-genre
of photography as it represents 25
men who. are homeless in Char-
lotte but who come from all over
the country and, apparently, from
extremely varied backgrounds.

This show avoids one of the
most obvious pitfalls of photo-
graphing the homeless, which is
romanticizing their situation or
trivializing it. The trade-off is that
the photographs are not much in
the way of an artistic achievement.
Though they, in most cases, cap-
ture a warmth in these men that
may be surprising, they don’t do it
in a very interesting way. The
images by themselves will not hold
your attention for long.

I don’t sense, however, that
this failing is a very important one,
for this show does do what it says
it aims to do: “to put a face and a

personality on the homeless popu-
lation.” Nearly all of the photo-
graphs are accompanied by cards

_on which a brief biography and a

few statements from each man
about his situation appear. Be-
tween the photographs and these
cards, the show becomes interest-
ing, effective, and in some cases,
quite moving.

The photographs help to un-
dercut our stereotypes of the home-
less, showing us men who are gen-
erally articulate, levelheaded, and
motivated.

They take more responsibility
for their lives than most Davidson
students probably do, demonstrat-
ing in this way the arbitrariness of
all of our social positions.

International Night in the 900 Room serves beers from around the world

By DAVE WILLIARD
Staff writer

Twenty-one-year-old Night,
that mighty Davidson College
Union institution, had some new
beers up its sleeve this last Tues-
day night. In deference to Solidar-
ity week, this Week’s gathering
was a special International Beer
night, and the bartenders served
some intriguing brew from the dark
depths of the 900 Room’s walk-in
fridge.

Among the favorites:
Newcastle Brown, an English se-
lection that had Jay Jennings smil-
‘ing all night. Tsing Tao was an-
other interesting beer, a Chinese
import that is rumored to be ahome-
brew, bottled by none other than
the Eastern guru himself, Dr. Hol-

land. Rounding out the regal menu
was Watney’s, another English
beer that'the barflies seemed to
prefer.

As German professor
Burkhard Henke sipped a Beck’s
and locked Scrabble horns with
math professor Todd Will, he ex-
plained the tendency for younger
professors to attend Twenty-one-
year-old Night.

“We are bachelors who have
no social life or are neglecting our
families. By the way, where’s
Shireen?” [ed. note: Dr. Carroll
agrees that Twenty-year-old Night
is fun but maintains she does in
fact have a social life.]

Perhaps the best part of it is its
laid-back atmosphere. “It allows
upperclassmen to interact in a ran-
dom way with beer, but without

the Court,” senior Allison Greenlee
said. Hal Daugherty, senior Psy-
chology major halfway on his way
to Greenwich Village, said that
“it’s a great place to go after FLAG
meetings, to scope your constitu-
ents.”

But no matter how you look at
it, logic major Hiro Iwamoto said
it best: “I like the elitist attitude
about Twenty-one-year-old Night
since all of us are at least twenty
one.”

By the way, festivities start up —

at 10:30 every Tuesday. Drafts are
$1.25, domestics are $1.75, im-
ports are $2, and pitchers are $4.
What a bargain! Tip your bartend-
ers!

D’abord” (“Our Friends First”)
by Georges Brassens.. Their a
cappella voices and ener-
getic acting brought laughter to
the tour group.

Moving to Latin America, the
tour stopped to see a performance
of the heated dance — the Salsa.
Janet Rodriguez and Tiese Manigo
moved about the stage with the
rhythmic music of the Salsa in the
background.

In each act, the students wore
traditional garb from their respec-
tive countries. Their clothing alone
brought international awareness to
the diverse group gathered in the
900 Room.

- The performance part of In-
ternational Night ended with Doris
Hermann’s angelic voice accom-
panied by John Seebach’s artful
guitar playing. Herchoice of songs
alone showed Doris’ individual
diversity. She sang songs in her
_ Native language, German, as well
as in French, Spanish and English!

The audience was allowed to par-
ticipate as well. The high point on
which the show ended continued
in the Morrison Room, where all
were able to get another “taste” of
foreign cultures. A variety of food
was catered by local restaurants.

Overall, International Night
was a wonderful experience for
all. The reunion of so many stu-
dents, and members of faculty and
staff certainly represented a per-
fect, symbolic unity for the end of
Solidarity Week.

for a computer company. Calvert
Reid was employed until his legs
were run over by a truck: “This is
aggravating, boring and it hurts.
My legs will never heal,” he says,
in what is for me one of the more
powerful portraits in the gallery.

I have some questions about
this show that qualify my interest
in it.

On the one hand, I wonder
why all of the men were photo-
graphed at the shelter rather than
on the streets, in the element in
which we who are not homeless
usually see them.

On a more general level, I
wonder why no women are in-
cluded in this project; they are on
the periphery even of this already
peripheral population.

Steve Earl Southerland says
he became homeless when his girl-

"The Faces of The Homeless”

friend dumped him. Terry
Alexander is a self-described
mama’s boy. :

Curtis Canada has a wife and
children living in a women’s shel-
ter in Charlotte. Women are inte-
gral to the lives of nearly all of
these men; I wonder why they are
only sketched on the edges of this
show.

“The Faces of the Homeless”
is something to pay attention to
and something to think about. In
spite of the show’s deficiencies
artistically and thematically, it
gives a voice to people we all see
but not nearly enough of us know.

It does this without a hint of
condescension or mystification,
and it does it with enough force
that if you take the time to read
these men’s lives, they will sit with
you for a long time.
