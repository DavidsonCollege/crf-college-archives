sions to printmaking. “The scale is
greater, and the process more fun.”
Owens stresses that he is nota per-
formance artist, but the crowd
gathered for his work certainly
added a social element to the work.
“It ‘de-analizes’ the printing proc-
ess,” he mentioned, bringing it out

of the studio, away from nitpicky
detail work. Furthermore, Owens
says that during the course of his
career his work has exposed him to
Many interesting people working
in junkyards and construction.
The process doesn’t always
work. Eyewitness English Profes-
sor Gill Holland commented on
the recent steamroller printmaking
session. “The first few tries were
failures, butall of asudden it started

getting interesting.” Owens him-
self says that failure is critical in
making good art. Only by risking
failure can the process truly teach
the artist anything and be a re-
warding experience. On this same
subject Owens commented that he
feels that his Davidson students
might leam more if they were will-
ing torisk more. He observed that
technically the students are highly
capable, but tended to be very safe

ALIAS VICTOR THE BEAR

Is Victor the Bear reduced to this?

He used to be in the bigtime; as
witness his photo/credentials, and

not that long ago: clowning with Bozo,
interviewing Larry King and -- my God, is
that Debbie Reynolds? Cherokee
Chief Ripyalloff chants 9 to 5:
Get your picture made with

V the B, White Eyes!

Who’s so sure he’s reduced?

Victor (real name Caleb) might savor
retirement in Smokey’s mountains green,
panhandling down the valleys wild,
and he might not. What’s sure is,
when the season’s last picturee’s
been goose-fleshed, Victor

retums to his unwheeled trailer

with the demode Ohio plates
and curls for the winter around
what’s left of him to bear

. 1991-92 Concent Series: acclaimed flutist David Fidele

and reserved in the images they
choose to create.

Owens credits his own influ-
ences to be Abstract Impression-
ism, earth works, and other proc-
ess oriented art. He recently has
been reading Zen philosophy and
is interested in the emphasis on the
importance of one immediate, fro-
zen moment in time. But to med-
dlesome questions about “influ-
ences” and “favorite literature”

Owens is quick to offer a favorite
aphorism that “talking about art is.
like looking for fis tracks in a dry
river bed.”

Owens will exhibit recent
work in the Davidson Art Gal-
lery in Chambers during the
month of January. The exhibit
is tentatively entitled “Random
Order”.
