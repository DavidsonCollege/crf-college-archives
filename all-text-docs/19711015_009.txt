Freshmen Crushed

“We're not moving the ball,
and if we can’t get the ball
moving we can’t expect to win
football games.”

That was the comment of
freshman football coach Tom
Stevens following Davidson's
loss to the Furman freshmen,
35-7, last Friday at Furman.
The loss evened the team’s rec-
ord at one win and one loss.

“Believe it or not, the de-
fense actually played a reason-
ably good ball game in spite
of what the score seems to in-
dicate. Eddie Womack at de-
fensive end, and Ronnie Ham-
ilton at defensive tackle, play-
ed particularly well,” Stevens
said.

“Our offense just - couldn't
move the ball. We couldn't geta
fround game going,” he added.

“We fumbled the ball away
something like three or four
times during the game, and
three of those were within our
five yard line.”

“They got three scores. off
of those, and it was 28-0 before
we even scored. They led at
half 28-7 and we had to gam-
ble to try and catch up and
we couldn't do it,” he comment-
ed.

“We should be pretty well off
offensively. We have some ex-
cellent individual players, but
we can’t get everything — to-
gether. It's a matter of execu-
tien,” Stevens. said.

‘We spend most of time in
practice running the offensive
plays the varsity will face in
their game, and there is little
time to get our own: execution
of plays down.

“The same applies to our
passing game. We have good
receivers in Gary Pomeroy and
tight end Lin Potts, but we
haven't been able to get the
ball to them, Our main_ pur-
pose is to acquaint the fresh-
men with the varsity offensive
and defensive system, and to
work on the fundamentals.
There isn’t much time to spend
perfecting the execution,” Stev
ens stated.
ahead, the next
freshman game is
against the Duke University
freshmen. Game time here in
Davidson will be 2 p.m.

The Duke freshmen have
beaten Wake Forest and lost to
Clemson and the ‘Kittens face
a tough battle as they reach the
midway point in their schedule.

“We're facing a good Duke
team. We've got to get our of-
fense moving. We need guys
who will hit and move the other
team out. In practice this week
we've been looking a little bet-
ter. I hope we do as well Fri-
day,” Stevens stated.

Looking
today

Rick Hendrix added a safety on
an intercepted kickoff as the
Sigs blanked the Pikaus Monday.
A sticky defense completely
muffled the Pika offense, which
lost’ star tailback Blair Abee
last Friday.

The Sigs romped past the Nus
46-0 last Thursday, behind Coop-
er Geraty’s three TD's and two
by Dave Russell, and stand 60,
a game ahead of the Pikas thru
Tuesday.

The Pikas (5-1) outscored the
KA‘’s 44-26 Friday, but Abee’s
loss overshadowed the — win.
Tom Ross tallied thrice and
Dave Mehlen twice, while John
Brandon scored two for the los-
ers.

The KA’s” shocked the’ E's

34-20) Monday, as soph flash
Chris) Holly romped to four
scores. Charlie Terrell added

the other touchdown for the vic
tors, who led 20-13 at halftime.
Roy Campbell, Dave Weaver
and Earl McCall got the E’s on
the board.

The E’s, now 5-1, had wallop-
cd Emanon | 31-7 Friday, as
Bob Whaicn counted twice, aft-
er crushing hapless Sentelle II
72-0 last Wednesday. They held
a shaky one game lead over
the Indies thru Tuesday, with
the KA'’s at 4-3.

The Indies won by forfeit over
Sentelle I] to remain a game
ahead of the KA’s in the battle
for playoff berths (only top two
teams in each division qualify).

The seemingly unbeatable
Delts (now 51-2 over last five
years) mercilessly pounded
Cannon {| 816 last Wednesday
as everyone but the housemoth-
er hit paydirt. Emanon tl wise-
ly decided to forfeit on Friday,
but on Wednesday the Betas led
6-0 at halftime before bowing
18-12 in a near-shocker.

Cannon I was unable to re-
cover from the Delt assault and
forfieted to the Taus the next
day, dropping them to 4-3, only
a half-game ahead of the Betas
and Taus, both 3-3. The Taus
only “action” was the forfeit
win over Cannon I.

Harriers Take Two

In Campbell Meet

By JIM HANNA
Copy Editor

When the Davidson cross-
country team wins, it wins in
a big way.

Coach Sterling Martin’s har-
riers chalked up not one, but
two victories Wednesday, and
things are definitely looking up
for the Wildcats.

According to Martin, his run-
ners did a ‘tremendous job” in
beating Campbell College and
St. Andrews in a tri-meet at
Buies Creek.

“This performance will put
the boys in a much better con-
dition, mentally, to go against
Washington and Lee and VMI
next week,” said Martin.

The dual victory came on the
heels of a loss to Wake Forest
here Monday, and evened the

Upset

In the IMAC’s weakest divi-
sion, Emanon II and Sentelle |
were tied at 34 for the top
spot, a half-game ahead of PAX
and SPE, both 2-4.

Emanon took a big win over
Sentelle 1 60-7 last Thursday,
but then dropped successive
games to the E's 31-7 and then
Tuesday to the Pikas 20-19 in a
inakeup game.

Scores by Pat Curley and Lar-
ry Ruddell gave Emanon a 13-6
halftime edge over the Pikas,
who then rallied on second-half
touchdowns by John Pecorak
and Bill Lear and a PAT by
Dave Mehlen to eke out the win
(protested by Emanon_ since
there was only one referee).

Sentelle I was racked by the
SPE’s 44-13 last Wednesday,
and after the humliiation by
Emanon, was whitewashed by
Watts | on Friday, in a disas-
trous three days.

The regular season was slated
to end Thursday. The playoffs
begin Monday.

harricrs’ record at two wins

and two losses.

The ‘Cats placed nine men
ahead of Campbell's fifth man
and eight runners ahead of St.
Andrew’s first finisher to win
22-40 against Campbell and 15-
50 over St. Andrews.

The race was won by Camp-
bell’s Dan Merritt, who had
time of 27:16 for the 5.1-mile
course, but Davidson runners
tvok the next four places.

Freshman Rick Bell finished
second, sixteen seconds behind
the winner. He was followed by
Joe Shibley, Paul Mitchell, and
Howard Boyd, in that order.

Ricky Deal finished eighth, to
round out the Wildcat top five.

“The boys did a really fine
job,” said) Martin, who had
some praise for nearly all his
runners.

“Ricky Bell is a very srtong
runner for us, and is our num-
ber one man. Paul Mitchell is
a steady runner, and he is go-
ing to be one of our top men.

“Ricky Deal is much improv
ed, and is in the top five for
us, as he ought to be. Howard
Boyd, who's been having some
problems, finally came into his
own, and he scored for us like
he should,” said Martin.

Martin also had some good
things to say about the ‘Cats
loss to Wake Forest here Mon-
day.

“Twas pleased with eur in-
dividual results, even though
we didn't win,” he said. ‘Ev-
erybody’s times improved tre-
mendously, and the exchange of
just a couple of places made
the difference against Wake.”
The Davidson squad lost to the
Deacons 24-35, with Rick Bell
finishing second, Joe Shibley
fourth, Paul Mitchell sixth, Ron
Clark cleventh, and Rick Mul-
len rounding out the Wildcat
scorers.

“They ran a good race against
Wake Forest, and they went out
to win the race, said Martin,
