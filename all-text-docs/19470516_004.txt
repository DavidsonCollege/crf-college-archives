THE DAVIDSONIAN

Friday, May 16, 1947

With the notable exception of Coach Pete Whittle’s
cindetmen who're scheduled to perform in the Southern
Conference tract meet this weekend, the 1947) spring
sports campaigns are. over for all the Red and Black
teams. Looking at the various aggregations separately
the record looks fairly good. The netters set the pace by
winning 13 matches in 18 outings followed by the golfers
and the tracksters with records of 9-6 and 4-3 reSpective-
ly, Only the “baseballers, who suffered Y6 defeats while
winninggnly 4+ games, failed to at least break even. When
the over-all totals of the school’s athletic representatives
are examined, however, the figures aren’t quite so im-
pressive. During the past three months Davidson's teams
have taken the field 60 times (excluding tournaments ),
winning 30 of the events for a percentage of .500. Against
games while losing an identical

loop foes the locals won 17 g

number. What these totals prove is problematical. It's

safe to. bet, tho, that the college’ll never make a real name
for itself in the “sporting world at this rate. We don't
advocate that an all out recruiting drive be launched or
that’ the school provide everything up to and including
spending money for its players as do ‘a number of larger
schools in this area, but we don’t see what harm it would
do the college to increase its athletic scholarships. It has
now reached the point where even men who'd like to
attend Davidson go elsewhere simply because it’s too
much of a struggle to get’by here on the alloted sums.
We're definitely opposed to out and out professionalism
but what's wrong with trying to get our share of North

Carolina’s college bound athletes ?

Since this is the year’s last issue we'd like to
tip our caps to a few of Davidson’s best who’re
ending their coilege careers this month, Among
the graduating class will be Ed White, the spark-
plug and the field general for this season’s basket-
ball squad, George Peters, Co-Captain of the track
team and a member of Coach Shepard’s starting
five, “Trader Buck” Archer of tennis fame, John-
ny Walker, one of the hardest hitting linemen
last fall, Pat Williams. end and forward, Dick
O’Hair,’ who saw much service as a wrestler and
a footballer, and many others. The shoes of all
these men will be hard to fill.

CONFERENCE CHATTER

William and Mary, a Johnny-come-lately among the
tennis powers in the loop, routed Carolina 8 to 1 in a
regularly scheduled match and then went on (in the
persons of Gardner Larned and Tut Bartzen) to cop
both the singles and doubles championships in the tour-
nament. On the basis of séason’s performances the Tar

APPRECIATION DEPARTMENT
It just wouldn’t be right to wind up these
proceedings without thanking the guys who've
worked long and hard behind the scenes fér the ;
sports department during the past months. My
sincere thanks to Chuck Cunningham, make-up
man and writer extraordinary, Mac Hart, our
capable utility man, Jack Hazar , Art Lindsay,
‘Lytes, Sohn Etis; Clayt Scofield, and Dick
Morgan. I’d also like to express our appreciations
to all the members of the college athletic staff
and the student managers who’s made our job
much easier than it would have been otherwise.
See you next year!

Softball was finished this week
with the Sigmas beating the SAE’s

New blood came to life in the
basketball competition and the end

Volleyball “set-ups” paid off for
the Sigmas, who dominated that

The Duke game could be consid-
ered a comedy of errors aS*-both
sides did everything wrong. David-
son grabbed a 3 run lead in their
half of the first inning but the
Blue Devils came back in the same
frame to push across two tallies.
Davidson kept pecking away, scor-
ing one run in each of the second,
third, and fifth innings. Duke came
back to score one in the second,
two in the-feurth,;+three in the sixth,
four in the seventh, and one in the
eighth to win going away.

Dick Richards was on the mound
for the Cats and wasn’t quite as
effective as against the Quantico
Marines. He was touched for fif-
teen base hits, gave up four walks,
and the team made three errors
behind him. On the Duke side of
the ledger, their two hurlers gave
up ten hits but the team made seven
errors to account for the six runs,

Landrun Halts Cats

The Clemson game was another
wild one. Malcolm Earp was the
hurler for the Cats and was pound-
ed hard by the league leaders. To
quote that worthy “I was pretty
good today—everything I threw
seemed to hit their bats.” To add
to the base hits and nine walks he
iSsued, there were seven miscues
maye by the team. Davidson’s lone
tally came in the fifth inning when
Ellis struck out but reached second
on the catcher’s error and scored
a moment later on Wade’s single
into left. Clemson’s ace, Joe “No
Hit” Landrum, was on the mound
for the Tigers and pitched beautiful
ball. He was touched for seven
singles, three by Pop Bowman, but
he was masterful in the pinches,

Season’s Summary

Thus the season ended with the
Wildcats having a season’s record
of 4 wins against 16 defeats. On
the black side of the books axe
wins over P, C., Wofford, Quantico,
and Cincinnati while on the red side
the losses are too great to enume-
rate. Despite the season’s record
it wasn’t such a bad team. The
outfield was one of the best in the
league with “King Kong” Sheppard,
Pop Bowman and Jack Burris rov-
ing the garden. Hal Mapes was
a consistent catcher throughout the
season and Charlie Pearson was as
fine a shortstop as there was in
the circuit. As a whole, the hit-
ting was very weak but a good,
and truthful, excuse for that could
be the lack of bats. The last three
games were played with only two
bats that had not been broken and
taped. :

Tommy Peters Memorial Trophy
To Be Presented To Brother

On Monday morning Davidson’s great Peters twins will make
their final joint appearance in Davidson athletic circles when George
is awarded the “Tommy Peters Memorial Trophy.”

Roddey Ousted
By Indian Ace

Last week, Davidson’s Bo Roddey
proved himself one of the top tennis
players in the Southern Conference
loop. Seeded number five in the
Tournament at Chapel Hill, the
Charlotte ' City champ defied all
comers until the quarter finals
where he met defeat at the hands
of William_and Mary’s Fred Koyale-
ski, himself seeded number three.
The only other Davidson player who
managed to slip by the second round
was Teddy Keesler who finally met
defeat by teammate Roddey.

Larned Singles Champ

Crowned singles champion was
Chicagoan Gardner Larned of Wil-
liam and Mary who had been seeded
number one. In the finals he whip-
ped Carolina’s Vic Seixas to take
the coronet away from the Tar Heel
campus where it has resided for the
past seven or eight years. In the
doubles, Larned teamed with Tut
Bartzen to win the Conference
doubles crown.

William and Mary put four play-

NET CAPTAIN

Buck Archer

ers into the top eight seeded men,
while Carolina had two, and David-
son and Maryland one apiece. Only
Maryland’s Ed Laberge failed to
win in his number eight slot, being
upset by Carolina’s Morris ‘in
straight sets. The rest of the favor-
ed netters swept on into the quarter
finals with little trouble. In the
semi-finals, the stage being  occu-
pied by three Indians and one Tar
Heel, the top men again came out
on top.

Archer Sets Pace

A quick backward glance~ over
the season would reveal the follow-
ing facts, among some: first that
the Davidsonians came through
with 13 wins out of 17 matches
played that Bo Roddey won 11 out
of 14 single matt¢hes that Captain
Buck Archer won 13 out of 16 sin-
gles matches played, being the only
man to win in the match with Caro-
lina. These facts hold high promise
for the future, especially since the
only heavy loss to the team will be
graduation of Archer.

There has been some rumor that
Coach -Lufler may not be back for
next season. We hope that this is
not true, as he has done a fine job
this past season. Although the
team was not able to win as many
matches as may have been desirable,
when last year is taken into con-
sideration, the schedule this year
was much harder, and losses were
to be expected. Next season, we
can expect somewhat the same sort
of schedule, and we wish the team
all the luck. To Bilt Lufler, we
can say well done, and hope for his
return next Spring.

The Trophy is to be presented
annually to “the athlete who best
typifies the Davidson spirit in ath-
letic ability, campus leadership and
team spirit.” It is an even more
fitting tribute to Tommy that his
brother George is so worthy to be
the first recipient of the award.

In a formal ceremony at chapel
Monday, Dr. Cunningham will make
the award and present George with
an inscribed plaque. The magnifi-
cient trophy will remain on proud
display in the alumni office with
George’s name engraved on the top
line; .

Parents Are Donors

Given by Mr. and Mrs. Robert L.
Peters of Kingsport, Tennessee, in
honor of their son who was killed
in action with the Third Army in

| Germany the trophy commemorates

one of Davidson’s all-time athletic
greats. Tommy and George entered
Davidson together in the fall of
1941. Before the first freshman
football game was over, the pair
had made a name for themselves as
a passing combination that was
hard to beat. Although the com-
bination paid off in football it
achieved a fame national in scope
on the basketball court. With Georgé
aiding and trailing only slightly be-
hind, Tom won acclaim as Southern
Conference high scorer and Most
Valuable Player in the 1942-’43
season.

In addition to basketball and foot-
ball honors, Tommy lettered in
baseball and track. He has the dis-
tinction of being the only man in
Davidson history to” make four
major sports letters in one year.

No one typifies the Davidson
spirit better than George does. Al-
ways a leader in campus activities,
he has guided the affairs of the
senior class conscientiously and well
as its president. Also president of
the “D” Club, he has revitalized
that organization and restored its
former influence and usefulness.

Tommy Bumbarger Paces
Golfers In Tourney

North Carolina’s Dick Doeschler
fired a 142 for thirty-six, holes over
the Old Town Club course in Win-
ston-Salem last weekend to lead his
team to the first post-war South-
ern Conference golf championship.
All told, the Tar Heels shot a team
score of 585 to come in 6 strokes
ahead of Duke’s defending champ-
ions. Jim McNair of the Blue Devils
also had a 142 for the grind to tie
Doeschler for individual honors.

For the Wildcats it was Tommy
Bumbarger who set the pace, going
the rounds in 152, But the rest of
the ’Cat team didn’t come through
as well as was hoped for, and the
Red and Black had to be satisfied
with a low standing score of 655.
Others besides Tommy who made
the trip were Don Bryant (160),
Cam Henderson (168), and Bill
Hodgins (174).

Cats Down Citadel

In two previous matches played

last THursday and Friday, the links-

'men defeated The Citadel Cadets,

11-7, in their second meeting of the
year. The first match produced
a 9%4-8%% score, with the Davidson-
ians coming out on the short end of
the deal. The second match, played
against Washington and Lee, ended
in a sound defeat for the Red and
Black, the Generals Sweeping to a
14-4 victory. But in the actual
Tournament, the Virginians - were
reported to have come home behind
the Wildcats which makes for some
consolation.

With the 1947 season now ended
and ready for the history books, we
can afford to take a quick ‘glance
back over the record. Those who
proved outstanding on the ‘team
were Tommy Bumbarger and Free-
man Jones both of whom consist-
netly shot low scores. Incidentally,
Freeman was unable to make the
Winston-Salem trip, which hurt the
’Cats a good deal. :

In adding up the final wins and
losses, the pellet-pushers set back
9 teams during the season, suffer-
ing defeat only 6 times. Wins over
South-Carolina, N. C. State, Wake
Forest, and Furman were some of
the major events, while the team
was never able to pull past Caro-
lina or Clemson.
