Women's lacrosse
takes tough loss v.
Lynchburg College

By Will Cobb

Last Friday, the women’s la-
crosse team made it's first home
appearance with students back in
school. TheWildcats took on
Lynchburg College under the lights
on Richardson Field. After
Davidson jumped out toa 1-0 lead
in the first 30 seconds of the game,

Lynchburg took over and never |

looked back. At the end of the
game, the score stood 16-4, as the
Wildcats suffered their fourth loss
of the season.

Liz Schaper scored her first
goal of the year to start the scoring
forthe evening. Freshwoman Rosie
Gaynor led the offense for
Davidson with two goals, and co-
captain Allison Adams added an-
other to round out the scoring for
the Wildcats.

Junior Mary Ferguson made
her first career start in goal, mak-
ing eight saves. Lynchburg
pounded out an immense 36 shots,
with 24 of them on goal.

Davidson will have to play the
rest of the year without starting
midfielder Amanda Bryan, who
suffered a broken finger in ascrim-
mage right before spring break.

“T think right now we are miss-
ing Amanda a lot, for her leader-
ship and talent,” said head coach
Kerstin Manning. ©

The Wildcats face Greensboro
this afternoon at 4:30 in a resched-
uled match from last Tuesday on
the field hockey field beside Baker.

“We need to keep concentrat-
ing and focussing on the basics.
Turnovers have really hurt us. We
are starting five freshmen, and the
players haven’t had a lot of experi-
ence playing together,” said Man-
ning.

“Overall, | am pleased right
now. These girls have really
worked hard,” said Manning.

After this afternoon’s game,
the Wildcats will wait nine days
before.they face Guilford at home

on April 13 at 4:30 p.m.

tucky helped bring the repeat cham-

pionship in 1992. That Duke team

. managed to win despite the pres-

sure of being ranked number one
all year.

I remember how I cried after

Duke lost in the 1986 champion-

ship game to Louisville. Earlier

that season I snuck into Cameron
Indoor Stadium for a couple of
games, and even got the team to
autograph a ball for me.

You see, everybody picks the
teams they’re gonna like when
they’re still young. I’m a San
Fransisco 49er’s fan because I liked
their uniforms when I was ten. I’m
a Braves fan because when I was
little, they were always on TV.
And I’m a Duke fan because my
dad took me to that game back in
1984. I guess I’ve been lucky in
picking the right teams.

The fans who declare alle-
giance to every other Division I
basketball team have already been
disappointed, including the Wild-
cat half of me. Only those fans
belonging to Duke and. Arkansas
remain. :

All logic says the Razorbacks
should win, but logic does not al-
ways follow. Of the teams I’ve
mentioned in this article that Duke
has beaten since its Final Four run
began in 1986, Temple,
Georgetown, UConn and UNLV
were all favored to beat the Blue
Devils. Tonight, Arkansas is the
favorite.

You make the call. But my
completely biased thinking says
the Blue Devils will win tonight:
Duke 87 Arkansas 85. I can’t lose
here. If Duke wins, I look like a
genius. If Arkansas wins, I was

just being a devoted fan. And
should the latter scenario take
place, don’t worry. Duke will prob-
ably be back in the Final Four

,again next year,.and when they are,

I'll pick ‘em again.
