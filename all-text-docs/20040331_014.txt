Super sophs lead the team in most offensive categories

The surge of talented un-
derclassmen continues with
Zage ‘07 and Crissey ’07

In 2003, the baseball team sported only two
players who batted over .300 for the season:
right fielder Sam Navarro ’05 at .329 and sec-
ond baseman Eli Benefield ’05 at .301. Those
two figured to be the leaders of the young 2004
squad as well, which features only three se-
niors on the roster.

Unfortunately, Navarro and Benefield have
struggled to recapture their sophomore form,
as each has failed to reach the .300 mark be-
hind the plate this year. The Wildcat line-up
has not missed a beat, however, as the 2004
squad has found production from other,
younger areas.

This year’s team features four players that
have batted over .300 for the season, double
last year’s total, but that list is headed by three
sophomores and a junior, none of whom bat-
ted over .250 in 2003.

In particular, sophomores Alex Entrekin,
Jay Heafner, and Ronnie Shore have thrived
in their everyday roles, leading the stat sheet
for the Wildcats with .364, .333, and .335 av-
erages at the plate, respectively. Each saw
extensive playing time last year and was ex-
pected to take on more of a role, but it would
have been hard to predict such a jump in per-
formance for the new season.

Entrekin, for example, has seen his aver-
age sky-rocket by more than 150 points and

has proved to be a clutch-hitter, with two
game-winning hits and a 17-game hit streak
to his credit already.

“You have to adjust to the speed of the pitch-
ing and quality of play [as a younger player] .
. . but this team has worked really hard to im-
prove,” he notes. “A lot of the younger guys
have really stepped up this year, with us hav-
ing only three seniors on the team.”

Along with the sophomores, a talented
group of freshmen has also emerged, both in
starting roles and in filling in the depth of this
young
Wildcat
team.
Gregory
Zage,
who can
play in
the out-
field and
at first
base, has
been the
offensive
hero of
late, hit-
ting the game-clinching home-run in the win
against Wake Forest and a two-run homer
against Western Carolina in this past
weekend’s loss. Zage’s recent offensive ex-
plosion has left him with a .600 slugging per-
centage, tops on the team by almost 150 points.

“T hoped, going into the season, to get some
[playing] time, but I did not plan on playing
immediately,” Zage says. “I felt that some time
would be needed so that I could adjust to how
the college game is played before I saw more
than occasional playing time.

Alex Entrekin 06 paces
the team in RBI (15).

“T felt that.I had had some good experience

‘prior to college, but I knew that I would need

to give myself to adjust to the game, espe-
cially with regards to pitchers’ off-speed stuff.
[had no idea how I was going to perform prior
to opening day. I had just hoped to contribute
when I had the chance.”

Freshmen Alden Crissney and Rob Wilson
have also seen significant playing time, with
the two sporting .270 and .263 averages, re-
spectively.

marily domi-
nated by up-
perclassmen,

and reliever roles.

Wilson, in particular, has stepped forward
to take the fourth spot in the Wildcats’ start-
ing rotation, sporting a 3-2 record and a 4.18
E.R.A. over 23 innings this season.

He earned many accolades at local Myers
Park High School as a senior last year and
helped lead the Mustangs to a State Finals
birth, but he knew “that the transition would
be tough both physically and psychologically.

“It’s more physical and much faster at this

level, and the work load on and off the field is
so much more than it was in high school,”
Wilson said. '

Still, Wilson came in fo the season expect-
ing to produce early on, saying, “My goal was
to start all along, as I think it is for everyone,
and we were all competing throughout the fall
and winter for those spots . . . You can never
be completely satisfied with how you play, but
I’ve been pretty happy with my play so far
this year.”

While the youthful emergence of this team
has been a
pleasant sur-
prise, its rela-
tive inexperi-
ence has also
contributed to
an inconsistent
start, with vic-
tories over

and Duke but

everthe-

less, despite the struggles that often accom-
pany a young team, that youth has the team
excited for the future of the program, one that
has languished at the bottom of the SoCon
standings in recent years.

With only three seniors on the current ros-
ter, and a precocious group of sophomores and
freshmen, the main nucleus of this team will
remain together for several years.

As Wilson says, that “bodes well for the
future” of this program.
