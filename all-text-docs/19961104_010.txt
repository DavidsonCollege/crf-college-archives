Movie Review

Ben DeLisa

By MatTrHew Hossig
Staff Writer

On Halloween Night many
ghoulish and ghastly activities
graced the grounds of Davidson
College.

As some attended parties and
looked for tricks and treats, others
went “up to the lab to ‘see what
[was] on the slab.” That something
was a special showing of The Rocky
Horror Picture Show in the Union
900 Room.

Students, in an orgy of black
garb, hairspray, heavy makeup, and
fishnet, filled the movie seats to
greet the singing lips of the open-
ing credits. Guided by the
“neckless” narrator, they began the
strange journey of Brad (asshole)
and Janet (slut) into, the clutches of
Dr. Frank Furter, the sweet trans-
vestite from Transsexual
Transylvania.

Rocky veterans and first-tim-
ers alike cheered, sang, and hurled
insults and other objects (rice, wa-
ter, toilet paper, and toast) toward
the screen and at each other.

Students stood to do the “Time
Warp” (again) and delighted in the
antics of seductive, sexy Magenta,
squealing, tapping Columbia, and
Rocky — Dr. Furter’s masterpiece
— through corny musical num-
bers and silly sex scenes:

As usual, most dozed off dur-
ing the Dr. Scott’s dinner song and
woke up in the pool to see the last
of the floor show and the death and
abduction of Dr. Furter back to
Transsexual Transylvania.

The Union provided props and
refreshments including “Dinner a
la Eddie” for this highly interac-
tive experience (Eddie was deli-
cious!). Kudos go to them for

bringing this 20 year-old cult clas-
sic to campus.

Sleepless in Hell’s Kitchen: friends avenge their abuse

By Susan RUGGIERO
Arts and Living Editor

Sleepers, the street name for
kids who have done time in a juve-
nile home, is anything but sleepy
during all of the 2 1/2 hours it lasts,
especially when the viewer takes
advantage of Eastern Federal The-
aters’ free refills on large sodas, as
no part of the movie is slow enough
for a restroom break.

Ihighly recommend the movie
for anyone interested in revenge,
Catholicism, New York’s Hell’s

Kitchen, Mafia, or juvenile homes

for boys. From the laughter, gasps _

and conversations in the audience
around me, I think many people
were also thoroughly entertained.

I also urge potential viewers
not to be discouraged from seeing
the movie as I was by some of the
headlining actors — Jason Patric,
Brad Pitt and Kevin Bacon. The
first two did not even appear on the
screen until a full hour into the
feature, and although Bacon’s role
was slightly typical of the charac-
ters he usually plays, he was per-

fect for the part. One of the most
enjoyable actors to watch was

Dustin Hoffman, a defense attor- ©

ney with a slight alcohol problem.
Fellow Oscar winner Robert
DeNiro not surprisingly also per-
formed flawlessly, as Father
Bobby, the caring priest who tries
to steer his altar boys in the right
direction and struggles with the
issue of sinning to help the same
people for whom he sets examples.

Father Bobby is the corner-
stone for the mixture of sin and
religion. Refreshingly, however,

religion is not knocked down in the
Movie, but portrayed in conflict zx
with human emotion.

Four diehard friends, all of
whom are played by actors with
very promising careers, take turns
being altar boys and leading pranks
suchas hiding in the priest’s side of
a confessional in 1967 and ’68, as
well as doing errands for a local
and influential mobster, King
Benny. Father Bobby acts as their
role model, during mass and on the
basketball court, as their parents,
many of whom are immigrants,

fight and abuse each other in a
world far apart from the women’s
liberation bra burners shown on
TV. The boys’ decision to pull a
prank one 97 degree day when
they should have been playing with
the neighborhood kids in arunning
hydrant, changed their lives for-
ever and led to a quest for revenge.

The boys were sent to
Wilkinson, ajuvenile home, where
the guards were free to enforce the
rules in any way they saw fit, as
