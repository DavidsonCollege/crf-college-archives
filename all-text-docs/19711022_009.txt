Blue lmps Destroy
Punchless ’Kittens

By SCOTT McMICHAEL
Staff Writer

It was a tie ballgame through
the first two minutes of the
first quarter when the Wild-
kittens hosted the Duke fresh-
men in Friday's football game.

However, two quick scores by
the Blue Imps put the ‘Kittens
in a deep hole.

Forced to play catch-up ball,
Davidson never recovered from
the early scores, losing to the
tune of 38 13.

The Wildkittens, now-1 - 2,
have a good chance to even
things at .500 when they meet
the Wake Forest freshmen here
on Monday.

Wake has_ been _ severely
trounced by both Duke and the
University of North Carolina.

On the fourth play run by
Duke, their bull fullback burst
loose for 51 yards and six points.
The next Duke scries saw the
quarterback run for 40 yards
and another touchdown. ~

Davidson was held scoreless
until early in the second period
when David Harper, the quar-
terback, scrambled eight yards
on a pass play for the score.

Duke added another and the
halftime scoreboard — showed
Duke out ahead, 19-7

The second half was more of
same. The ‘Kitten defense, hit
ting harder than before but still
missing tackles, gave up three
more touchdowns after long
drives by the Blue Imps.

Harper scored Davidson's sec-
ond touchdown in the third
quarter on a one yard run.

After the game with Wake
Forest on Monday, the Wild

kittens will close their season
against The Citadel on Novem-

twice. Jack Linnard added the
final point in the third period.

Guilford's sole score came in
the second quarter. .

Tuesday at 4 p.m., the booters
will host St. Andrews. Coach
Hally Fogleman predicted ‘‘a
good game with a good team.”

St. Andrews, like Belmont -
emphasis on their soccer team.

Neither school fields a football

Tuesday the Wildcats hosted

Here's a quickie-quiz for to-
day: When was the last time
the Davidson Wildcats won a
home football game?

Readers with sharp memories
will recall that on November 1,
1969, the Wildcats demolished
VMI 59-6 in the Homecoming
game.

The 'Cats entertain the Wof-
ford Terriers tomorrow at Rich-
ardson Field in an appropriate-
ly-named Homecoming contest,
and will be trying tc break the
two-year home victory drought.

Wofford has been an _ incon-
sistent team this season, post-
ing a 2-3 record.

The Terriers have knocked
off Lenoir-Rhyne and Furman
while suffering losses to Elon,
Presbyterian and Newberry.

The Terriers run the Wish-
bone offense, which the 'Cats
have already faced against Ap-
palachian. Executing the tricky
offense are three backs from

Tarr led the scoring in the
Belmont-Abbey game, _ kicking
in three of the ’Cats six goals.
Spinner, Steve Culbertson and
Mike Tanner each added once.

Last Saturday, the  booters
took an 8 - 0 win from Pfeiffer
in Pfieffer's Homecoming con-
test.

The team is still suffering
from injuries, and will pro-
bably not be back to full

strength for at least another
week according to Fogleman.
Seraphin Gbari, who scored
five goals until his leg injury
at Furman, may be able to
return for Tuesday’s match.

Both Johnny Robison and
Charlie Heiner, the starting
goalie, will be out for another
week or more.

Fogleman said the team par-
ticularly misses Robison  be-
cause he is quick and works
well with a “garbage ball,” a
loose ball in the goal area.

Wing Dick Spinner has led
the soccer scoring so far in
the season, booting in nine
goals.

He is followed by Tarr with
six goals, Gbari and Tornee
with five each, and Joe Yochem
and Jack Linnard with four.

Tackle Wofford

last season’s NAIA runner-up
team.

The man to stop, according
to Wildcat assistant coach Alex
Gettys, is powerful fullback
Clifford Boyd. Boyd has aver-
aged 4.2 yards per carry to date,
and is very effective on a
Straight dive play up the mid-
dle.

Replacing graduated quarter-
back Harold Chandler has not
been an easy job for newcomer
Eddie Woody. Woody is a strong
runner but not a very imposing
passer.

Defensively the Terriers will
rely on quickness to try to stifle
the ’Cats, who have tallied only
60 points in six games.

Gettys expressed pleasure that
defenders Woody Montgomery
and Jim Hardison will see ac-
tion tomorrow, after being side-
lined with injuries.

“The sophomores who took
their places will certanily not
be put back on the shelf,” Get-
tys explained, ‘‘because Ross
Manire, Eddie Williamson and
Jim Purcell have all done great
jobs.”

Last week's 41-6 loss to Fur-
man was a bitter pill for the
‘Cats to swallow. The offense
accumulated plenty of yardage
but was victimized by four fum-
bles and four interceptions.

Tomorrow's game shapes up
as a real battle, for as Gettys
Says, ‘‘Wofford always seems to
get psyched for us, and they
will really be angry since New-
berry beat them so badly last
week.”

As far as the Wildcats are
concerned, they must win if
they are to keep any hopes of
a break-even season alive.
