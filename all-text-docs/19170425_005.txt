OUR SONG.

Some months ago a Davidson College
song was promised. “Io the composer ot
this “Davidson Song” was * offered a
Gold Medal tennis racket. Undoubted-
ly the Blue Pencil Club has long since

‘made its decision as to the lucky person.

Undoubtedly the commissary has long
since awarded the prize and fulfilled
their part of the contract. But where.
oh, where is “that song of victory,” that
song that “will stir the blood 2” Is it so
“punk” that it has been consigned to the
obscurity of a pigeon hole or trunk tray?

Probably it is being groomed and held
ready for the opening of the football
season. But is football the only game at
which Davidson can display any spirit?
Is the lack of “pep” at baseball games s»
decidedly lacking that not a sound can
be raised to cheer on out balldom heroes?

What about unearthing this David-
son song and giving it a trial? The
humming or whistling of it will surely
sound as well on the campus as worn-out
“Pretty Baby.” At any rate, if we are
to use this glorious “unknown” in foot-
ball this fall, it might not be a bad idea
to know it.

If it is really a song full of pep and
fight like the Yale “Bula” or “Washing-
ton and Lee Swing,” we will be thank-
ful to the commissary and THe Davin-
SONIAN.

And when little Freshie goes home
this spring and stands around the piano
of his loved one, he won't be ashamed to
pull out a copy of this battle hymn and
humbly beg her to play over and over
again that old song that is going to lead
Davidson to. victory again—when — he
comes back as a Sophomore,

DEMOCRACY VS. AUTOCRACY.
When puppet kings of petty realms.
Do vie to wear a golden crown,
And clothe themeelves in royal robes
And drink the potent draught,

And try to mold with their weak hands

A kingdom made from their own
thought

And fain would change with but a word

‘The things that time has slowly
wrought,

They sadly err. Weaklings they are.
Brittle clav is thought of man

Which slightly yields to foolish kings.
Moulds itself in the Potter's hand.

Let “Wilhelm” pass, a metcor spent ;
Also his autocratic school.
Give true Democracy its place,
Let God’s own Voice forevér rule.

SOME INSIDE INFORMATION.

By Prof. A. M4. Trawick.

Dear Mr. Man:

Say, Bo, have you ever been to Bluc
Ridge Summer School ?
Carolina. you know, the other side: of
Asheville, this side of the Ridge Crest
just below Brown's Pasture, not far
from Spanish Castle. You couldn't mis
the way. Take the right hand road
after leaving Black Moun‘ain, and keep
on taking the right every time you come
‘o the forks of the road, except the last
time, where you take the road straight
ahead. You can ride in a Ford if you
have 40 cents, but you can walk if you
need to. Hounshell always walks.

There will be others there. From
Old Kaintuck to Mobile Bay, from Vir-
‘nia Beach to Oxford, Miss., they come,
and many of them will walk because

on the conference truck if you want.
Bob Denny, who has been at Blue Ridge
before, left his bundle under Booker
Washington's cottage, so you need not
wonder why he did not bring anything
with him.

Hurry up and get to Robert E. Lee

Hall before supper. Mr. Wells may not
know just how hungty you are, and if
you are not prompt Fatty Poteat will
get to the table first. Let me tell you
now, so you will never forget it, Fatty
was never known to be late at meal time.
Another thing you will discover — for
yourself, the first supper is the best meal
you will have tor ten days. Be sure to
make the best of it. ‘hereafter it will
be black-strap and baked beans.

While you are cating, a@ very import-
ant, youngist looking man will call upon
you to lay down your knife and listen tu
nim. You might just as well put your
knife right down, for Doc Weathertord
is going to make his fist speech. You
will hear hin many, many times, but he
always breaks into this first supper with
a speech. He will say: “Men” (and
in this torm of address he does not really
mean to exclude Phil Vrigg and Roy
John—Doc is very polite) “ten,” ays
uc, looking out tuward W. D., Jr.,
have thought again and again and gain
how | can make this conference the most
tremendously real thing in your lives. |
want you to throw yourselves with per-
fect abandon into every feature of the
program-—i want you to throw your-
selves with pertect abandon into the puoi
every morning before breaktast.” Here
Sam Parker jumps upon the table and
proposes three long rays for Doc Weath-
erford; and the lid is off.

‘The real business uf the conference
has now begun. “Phe business is divid-
cd into three parts: (1) Yelling. Lvery-
budy must yell, Yell every tine any-
thing is said, yell every tine anything 1s
not said. Ht you cannot yell, sing; i
you cannot sing, do like Fitzgerald dues
—sing bass. Make a noise! Give tt-
teen rays for Kiser William, Watt
Raine, or Martha Washington! Wake
‘em up!

(2) Athletics. ‘Vinis feature of the
conference consists ino walking over to
Ray Legat’s farm for afternvon — tea,
playing Rook with the girls in Lee Hall,
cr in attending Dr. Horhe’s lecture on
sub-conscious epistemology. Some of the
holder spirits go up to Mrs. Flobb’s
cottage to kill snakes, and a few lis:en
ty Ed Cook tell what he is going to do
when he becomes a Bishop. Martha
Washington goes to the pool for her
annual squeal.

(3) Stunt Night. ‘Phis is the spot
light conference proceedings; the reason
why; the irreduceable minimum; — the
sine qua non of the conference program,
On this occasion the faculty, together
with Dr. Brown, pratessor emeritus of
Public Speaking, and Will Webb, head-
master of the Department of © Wind

Doc Poteat,

Malcolm Guess repeats that thrilling
little poem: “Lips that have touched

lights go out. It is a great occasion.

Now, Bo, if there is anvthing else
important about the Blue Ridge Confer-
ence, | will say it if you will remind me
of it. 1 may have overlooked a few
things like the class room work, the plat-
form addresses, the life-work appeals,
the financial session, the big men and
the friendship the conference makes pos-
