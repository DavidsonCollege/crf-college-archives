“Jan Postma is definitely
a candidate to open the sea-

Terry Holland. *‘He has con-

Presently there is battle
between DeMoisey and Ron
Stelzer for the point position.
According to Holland, Stelzer
is the better shooter but with
DeMoisey the offense has
appeared sharper. Stelzer
saw quite a bit of aciton last
season but Fox apparently
has the inside track. The
coaches have also been ex-
perimenting using Brian
Adrain and Postma at the
point.

East IV, Cannon III Make
Freshman Flickerball Final

By RICK BUSH
Sports Writer

{he freshman flickerball
season moved to a close
Tuesday with the semifinal
games among the divisional
champions and the runner-
ups...

In that semifinal action
East IV won the right to
face Cannon III as East de-
feated Watts II, runners-
up in the “B" Division ‘by
a 13-6 count while ‘Cannon
rolled over ~the ‘“‘B” Di-
vision champs , Watts IV,
27-13. :

East IV struck with a
touchdown on their first
play from scrimmage and
then. turned the job. over to
the defense which stymied
Watts for nearly the entire
game. East TV turned in ten
interceptions to ,stop the
Watts team in its tracks.

Watts scored on a Vic
Fleming to Pat Curley pass

at the end of the first half
but was unable to mount
another. offensive drive in
the second half. East scored
late in the game on an 18
yard pass from Frank Smith
to Steve Wright to conclude
the scoring.

Long bombs played a ma-
jor role in Cannon III's up-
set over Watts |IV. Tailback
Dick Halligan hit Bob Lewis

‘for two long scores and the’

previously unbeaten Watts
IV ‘never recovered. Lewis
and Lloyd Moss each gather-
ed in short touchdown pass-
es, for the winners.

David Varner, the Watts
tailback, attributed the loss
to mistakes and dropped
passes. ‘‘We choked.”’

The bright spot for the”
losers was an outstanding
leaping cateh by Scott Beard
for one of their two scores.

The regular season provid-
ed close competition for the

four play-off berths as sec- “

ond place in both divisions
was decided by the narrow-
est of margins.

In the ‘*A"’ Division East
III finished only one game
out of second, dropping a
squeeker in the season fin-
ale to East IV. ‘‘We lost by
just one foot,’’ said captain
Larry Duncan. ‘‘What would
have been the winning touch-
down fell just that far
short.”

Cannon IV missed the run-
ner-up spot in the ‘‘B"’ Di-
vision, by a single game.
They played well enough to
win their big game with
Watts IV but the result was
reversed on a forfeit call
when it was discovered that
a Cannon player had worn
cleats. One of the few teams
to use a two platoon system,
they got consistently good
performances from Pete Jor-
genson at defensive end and

er and receiver.

Not much is known about

By BILLY COBB

Coach Harry Fogleman's
Wildcats failed in their at-
tempt to capture the South-
ern Conference soccer cham-
pionship by falling 5-0 to
George Washington.

About the defeat" last
Saturday which completed
the 1969 campaign with a
4-6 1 overall — record,
Coach Fogleman remarked,
“George Washington hand-
led the ball better than any-
ones we've faced all year.
The strength of their team
can be attested by noting
that there was only one
American boy on the whole
squad."’

The Wildcats earned the
birth in th echampionship
game with Colonials by de-
feating The Citadel two
weeks ago. s

In looking over the entire
season Fogleman was amaz-
ed that the Wildcats produc-
ed a losing season with such
a good team. He stated that
the record was misleading
because four games were
lost by only one goal.

“I think we would have
done much better if we had
one more big offensive play-
er to back up Steve Culbert-
son. And, of course, we lost
‘Cliff Patterson again for the
last five games which was
definitely a big blow for us.
