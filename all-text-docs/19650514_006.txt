Controversy At

By BOB HOLLADA/
Davidsonian Staff Weiter
The situation of Dr. Wil-
liam F. Goodykoontz, a
former Davidson professor
of English, has stimulated a
“publish or perish” contro-
versy at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.

Mired on a per annum basis
for the past two years as a
lecturer in English, Goodkoontz

next year.

The head of the English De-
partment, Dr. George Harper.
told UNC's student newspaper,
the Daily Tar Heel, that Goody-
koontz (who is 51) had not pub
lished enough, was too old to
start off in the department, and
was a controversial teacher,

approximately $300 was donated by the faculty and ad-

Davis. head solicitor, added that there were still some
pledges to be collected which would boost the total

does not do all these things, the
well goes dry.’ He also pointed |
out that many professors had!
been promoted simply because
they were good teachers.

The student newspaper noted
this last point. and said that the
question should be, ‘‘ ‘What is
the real reason for not retain-
ing this man?* There are simp-
ly too many nonpublishing pro-
fessors in high position. here to
believe for a minute that an
English lecturer would not be
rehired because he has not pub-

A columnist suggested that
Goodykoontz's teaching methods

students with criticisms of the

1933. He is currently professor

said Davis. “I think the re-
sponse from the students
was on the whole very good,
especially in comparison
with the way the drive has
gone in the past years.

“The time of collection un-
doubtedly hurt us, since it was
right after Spring Frolics and
caught the seniors at a time
when they didn’t care about this
sort of thing. In the future the
drive should be condicted dur.

The money from IFC is an ac-

Concerning the sponsoring or-

Ike ‘o recommend that the fund
be taken from the auspices of
the YMCA and put in the hands
of an independent student or-

the Y without using the name
of the YMCA. |

My main reason for this is!
that many students object to:
solicitations by the YMCA twice
a year. and that this would then
make for better results from
both drives."

FUNDS SHORT

The proceeds from the Easter
Fund Drive will bring to a total
of $3400 the contributions to be 3%.

change project which will send
9 students to Ecuador this sum-
