Having a full-time orderiy is
another improvement strongly
needed, according to Mrs.
Sherrill. ‘When the Infirmary
was first built almost 40 years
ago, the college felt the need
for an orderly that worked 5%
days a week.

At that time there were
between 600 and 800 students.
Now that the college has over

difficult for one of the rotating
doctors to know what to do for
a patient that has already been
seen by the other doctor unless
he has the medical record
before him.

At present a secretary only
comes in twice a week, on
Sundays and Thursdays. Be-
cause of this the records are
usually out of date, according
to Mrs. Sherrill:

not enough private rooms.
When patients who are very ill
have to be put in the same
ward as patients who are
almost well, they suffer, said
Mrs. Sherrill.

Another bathroom is needed
upstairs. The offices need to
be refurbished. A second ex-
amination room is needed to
replace the makeshift room
now being used in which an
x-ray table is being adapted as
an examination table, said
Mrs. Sherrill.

Most of the beds and mat-
tresses are forty years old. The
mattress springs are shot. For

nurses have asked for a new
microscope without getting it.

“We think we are doing an
excellent job considering our
circumstances,’’ said Mrs.
Christian.

Despite having these com-
plaints, the nurses stressed
that they enjoyed their work,
that they had good rapport

don’t feel the same needs,
according to Mrs. Sherrill.

There have been times when
male students have fainted on
the commode or in the shower
that the female staff sorely
wished for a male orderly.
Besides, said Sherrill, there
are times when male students
need to be given baths.

An orderly is also needed to
keep the Infirmary clean. At
present, the nurses have to
take time away from caring for
patients to do menial cleaning
chores.

Mrs. Sherrill also stated
that a secretary should be
hired to come in for a short
while every morning and type

good example,’’ says Terry.
“We don’t need to duplicate
X-ray equipment when we
have it seven miles away. You
also have to have a trained
radiologist to read the X-rays
right.”

These improvements dep-
end upon funding. As Terry
says, ‘‘The only thing stop-
ping us is money.”’ The Infir-
mary will maintain the same
operating budget as last year.
It has no capital budget.

The administration explains
the delay in infirmary impro-
vement funding. Terry says,
“TI would like the new doctors
to be a part of the retooling of
infirmary funds. They will be
in a better position to do so.”

Spencer adds, ‘‘When we do
it, we want to do it right.”

Anyone who has stayed in the
Infirmary knows the facility is in-
adequate. Whether their complaint be
he rotation of doctors leading to
nflicting diagnoses or uncomfort-
ble bedding they come out of the
Infirmary with tales which discourage
ir friends from even going when
sary.

What we have is a problem far
ter than ah inadequate Infirmary.
he problem is attitudinal. Once
again we have a budget priority
roblem.
Just as they work in an outdated
hemistry building, suffer the incon-
4 enience of overcrowding and insuffi-

stration to allocate funds for impro-

vement they either go to Charlotte or
receive no medical aid. Naturally they
infect the rest of the students around
him.

The administration is guilty of
similar laziness. ‘‘Things are going to
be better in 1978,” they say. We're all
very happy for the students of ’78.
We all hope they receive sufficient
health care. What are the students of
’'77 supposed to do in the meantime?

It seems when we can find people
interested in funding a radio station
we could try just as hard to find
someone to give to the Infirmary.
After all; we’re only talking about the
health of the student body:

The promise of utopian ’78 becomes
almost a deterrent to improvement
because it provides an easy escape
route. Any request for improvement

2 postponed to 78 when ‘‘things

dis

will be better’’.

And the promise for some improve-
ment also alleviates the pressure for
extensive improvement. We are going
to get new doctors but what about
new beds? What about a new build-
ing? We are too easily satisfied.

Attitude problem exceeds facility's

So now students must do without
sufficient health care: The least we
could do would be to say something.

The Huntersville doctors are leav-
ing in May and do not have to worry
about contract renewal, but they
could be reminded by the administra-
tion of the responsibilities they owe to
their present contract.

And students in '77 have the right
to demand decent health care. Even if
they do not get it because of the
inflexibility of funding they should at
least voice their complaints. Dr.
Spencer was not even aware the
Infirmary needed new beds. The lack
of communication is the result of ir-
responsibility on both the students’
and the administration's parts.

As a matter of principle it is better
to say something than give up before
the fight. It would be more productive
than infecting an entire dorm.
