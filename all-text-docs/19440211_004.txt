SCRATCHINGS
by Skrotemfeldt

Valentine’s Day, T am told, is! thought the time honored day might

celebrated on the 14th of February.
Why it does not appear on some
other day is vaguely connected with
the mating of turtle-doves, and pos-
sibly because, discounting birthdays,
as women are so prone to do, it
isa long wait from Christinas to
Christmas,

A pocket-worn day, it probably
started when some cave-man, find-
ing a peculiarly attractive stone,
decided to transport it to his true-
love, as a token of his steam, Bring-
ing it to her he promtply bashed it
over her head, and she being over-
whelmed with the occasion, agreed
that he should be her life mate. This
celebration grew and was probably
called Ugh’s Day, coming in the
moon of Whug, (Language not
being superfluous in those days).

Advancing from this more sensible
stage, the day becomes prominent,
and somewhere through . History’s
voluminous pages it acquired the
name of St. Valentine's Day. (Tor
my own part, I have always ‘been
partial to St. Andrew, but who am
I to judge the amorosity of a Saint.)
Ever developing it comes to us in
our modern day.

At one time, due to the increasing

trend of Individualism, it was

fade away. Thousands of couples
began to quarrel, and marriage rates
dropped. frightfully. Romance Steer-
ed mercilessly for stones and things
were looking down. But the “Greet-
ing Card and Candy Makers Union”
quickly came to the rescue, and Val-
entine’s was soon on its feet again.

However, it was not without con-
troversy. It is rumored that at one
period the apostles of the “Heart
Shaped” greeting drew up in arms
against those followers of the
“Square Shaped” remembrance, and
much blood was shed on both sides.
In the following peace it was agreed
that upon joining a Valentine's Bet-
terment Association, any and every
member would be allowed to send
either “Heart Shaped” or “Square
Shaped“ greetings, supplemented
by confections, apparel or other
items considered pleasing to the
feminine gender.

All in all, Valentine’s seems to be
a thoroughly likable event, ieaping
dividends for both male and female.
However, the main theme remains:
“The coat and the pants do all of
the work, and the dress gets all the
gravy.”
