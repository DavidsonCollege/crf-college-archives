McKeithen, Shue, Colvin
Debate SophomoreRush

By LEONARD RICHARDSON
A round table debate last Wednesday night presented IFC President Ward Mc- |

Keithen, independent Henry Shue, and Tommy Colvin in a discussion of fraternities
at Davidson, with special emphasis on the proposed sophomore rush.

McKeithen
After stating his views on the
place of fraternities in David-
son’s philosophy of education,
Ward McKeithen explained his

opposition to sophomore rush.
He suggested that sophomore
rush might weaken the smaller

fraternities, reduce diversifica-
tion in the fraternities, and cut
down the contacts between
freshmen and upperclassmen.
“I'm not sure sophomore rush
would reduce pressure on the
freshmen. Fraternity men

might turn dance weekend par-
ties into rush parties.”

Henry Shue brought out ar- = boarding houses, |

guments in favor of changes in
the present rushing system.
“With rush at the beginning of

The regulations will be as pre-|
viously announced with all pre-
initiation activities ending at 9
p.m, Monday, 10 p.m. Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday, and

“Sophomore rush would give

For The Davidson Athlete

By B. MILLNER ‘
Davidsonian Sports Editor

Editor's Note: This article is the third in a series of four investigating the
relationship between subsidized athletics and the academic program.

“There are many boys playing football and basketball who would not be
{here if they hadn’t received aid in the form of athletic scholarships. I know that
many of them needed help; I would say more than 50 percent. I think that is one
of the most important advantages in having a subsidized athletic program,’

Q. According to our infor-
mation, the average major
athletic grant amounts to
$1050, while the average ma-
jor academic grant is only
$400. For an educational in-
stitution of Davidson's type,
is it justifiable to emphasize
athletics at the expense of
the academic subsidization?

A: “I don't think that it is at
the expense of the academic
program, and I'll tell you why.
For a number of years, an or-
ganization known as the Wild-
cat Club raised all of the money
for athletic scholarships. In

between the two money-raising
the Wildcat Club
and the Alumni-effice. For the
good of the school and for bet-
ter harmony, the Living En-
dowment Fund was created. As
this fund has increased from
year to’ year, so the amount of
athletic scholarships has_ in-
creased proportionately. Foot.
ball scholarships, however, have
not. increased proportionately
because of the increase in bas-
ketball scholarships, which
were almost nonexistent when
the fund was established.

Dr. Martin pointed out that
being a member of the South-

organizations,

His family could well afford to
send him to school, but if we
hadn't given him a football
scholarship, he probably would
have gone somewhere else.”
Dr. Martin explained that
even though a boy is financially
able to come to Davidson, it is
often necessary to offer him a
football scholarship to compete
against Southern Conference
members and other schools for
him. Sometimes, this pays off
for the college, in the form of
contributions particularly if the
boy’s father is an alumnus.
