Rock ‘n Roll Triumphs
Over The Old Fogies

More Davidson freshmen can
identify the Everly Brothers - of
“Wake Up Little Susie” fame—than
can identify Bismark, Thomas Mann.
Jesse Owens, Haydn. and a portion
of the American Bill of Rights.

As incredible as it may seem, a
DAVIDSONIAN poll (see page one)
this week showed that the average
freshmen (based on 115.students) does
‘not have a working knowledge of
famous names of the past and the
present.

We were shocked to find that one
out of every four had no idea who
Karl Marx was. Marx was identified
as everything from a radio commen-
tator to a TV commedian.

Now the free world has onlv spent
about a trillion dollars to defend
against Marx's communistic ideology.
and every daily newspaper for thé
past twelve vears has beamed head-
lines about the galloping hooves of
communism.

And not to be forgotten are the
over 100.000 Americans who died in
Korea fighting Marx's doctrine—in-
ternational communism.

Whoever thinks that Karl Marx
is a commedian- might feel differently
when they wake up some morning and
find Pravda instead of The Observer
by their dormitory door.

But this is not all. The poll. re-
vealed that Elvis “The Pelvis’ Press-
ley and Emilv Post were better known
than John the Baptist. Plato. Magna
Carta. and John Hancock.

What does this mean? Don't stu-,
dents read newspapers or magazines
anymore? Aren't they interested in
what goes on in the world—or even

on the Davidson campus for that mat-
ter.

It is significant that only one in
three knew the captain of the football
team. and a little over half could
identify Mr. C. Shaw Smith.

Some of the ahswers given on the
poil were ridiculously funny. For
example, identifying Plato as ‘Mickey
Mouse's dog”, and Clare Booth Luce
as “the wife of the man who shot
Lincoln” cannot but bring a smile.

All, however, is not smiles. When
less than half can identify a portion
of the Bill of Rights and 26° do not
recognize a famous Bible verse. then
it is time that somebody—the fresh-
men and the educators—do a little
reappraising.

It is hard to imagine a boy being
accepted in Princeton or Yale who
doesn't Know Karl Marx or John the
Baptist. ,

Who's fault is it that so few can
identify key political, scientific, ath-
letic. and literary figures of our his-
tery? Certainly we cannot put all the
blame on the. freshmen.

We have a feeling that their high
sehool training might have had some-
thing to do with it. We wonder, never-
theless. just how many do read a
newspaper, or a national magazine. or
even a historical novel every now and
then.

In summing up, we must say that
we still don’t understand the lack
of knowledge. Maybe it is just too
much. to expect college students to be
able to identify old fogies like Bis-
mark and Plato.

We wonder. however, how these
freshmen stacked up on the College
Board Entrance examinations?

Vespers Is Part
Of Heritage

Vespers at Davidson has long been
regarded by, many as a unique fea-
ture of the College. Others regard
vespers as a peculiar feature.

THE DAVIDSONIAN wishes to re-
affirm its support of this tradition of
the College.

Nothing is more useless than tra-
dition without a purpose. But this re-
quired exercise was implemented with
a purpose in mind. Here the College
has taken‘definite stand on Christiani-
tv.

Opponents have argued with fer-
vor that such “required religion’ (a
misnomer) has soured them on re-
ligion and in some cases driven them

from the church altogether. The real

question here is simple, is vespers the
reason or. the excuse?

Other objection concerned with
the service itself seern more valid.
Often-times the speakers have
nothing to say. and even more often
they instruct in the wrong manner. A
preacher should remember that just
because a sermon suits well his home
church on Sunday morning. that does
not guarantee its value when de-
livered to students on Sunday evening. -

We must remember that there is
an element of choice in compulsory
religious exercises after all. A student
when he chooses Davidson for his
higher education decides many things
automatically, and vespers is one of
them.

Though these services are not al-
ways a religious experience, they are
an educational one. Few speakers lack
an audience.

Superficially, it will seem to be a
dichotomy of the first order to urge
strongly the continuance of required
vespers and then propose what we
are about to purpose. But the incon-

gruitv is only surface.

We strongly urge that the entire
Communion Service be placed on a
voluntary attendance basis. The medi-
tation sermon has little meaning to
those who choose to depart, and the
departure of some students is an in-
terrupting influence to those who
choose to remain and participate in
this the greatest and most Holy mo-
ment in the Church —G.L.W.

Why Fraternity?

‘Any justification for the fraterni-
ty system ultimately boils down to the
realistic fact that people—by their
very nature—desire to be together. “

The psychologist mav call this gre-
gariousness, the layman the “herd in-
Stinct”. and the individualist the posi-
tive application of the ‘right of vol-
untary association.”

The Utopian philosopher. died out
some years ago, but there always are
those who like to draw up plans for
regulating human behavior, and at-
tempting to regiment everything and
evervbody to a set standard.

As we understand it, the sole pur-
pose of a social fraternity is to pro-
mote friendship among its members.

A social fraternity does not exist
primarily as a means for carrying out
the college’s polieies, nor as a ser:
vice club, nor even as a place where
one can pick up three meals a day.
Now these might be the main pur-
poses of some clubs, but not of a
truly social fraternity.

Take away the right to be ‘“ex-
clusive,”’ and the right to join to-
gether simply for the purposes of
being together, and you have cut the
heart out of the fraternity system.

If we cannot justify the fraternity
system on the basis of the “right of
voluntary association,” then we can
hardly justify any of the other basic
human rights.

Great Gray Golfer. . .

By PHIL LEWIS

Gary Fisher has announced that he-is collecting
names on a petition entitled: “A Petition for the Elimina-
tion of Smilin’ Jack from the Charlotte Observer’. Any-
one interested in this worthwhile endeavor should see
Gary at. the first opportunity.

One activity

f the College community which has

been operating without fanfare this year is the college
laundry. We want to congratulate Mr. Staeks and his staff
for his wonderful job in adding tasteful smudges to our
shirts. adjusting the size of’ our socks, and fragmentizing
our buttons. All of this adds immeasureably to our en-

joyment of college life.

This column is sponsoring a brand new organization
on campus—The Society for the Protection of Southern
White Protestant Conservatism at Davidson College, Inc.
Since we are told that 90% of our little community falls
generally into the category of Southern white protestant
conservatives, we expect to put all those ultra liberal or-
ganizations like Greek letter fraternities, denominational
fellowships, and literary societies out of business in no

time at all.

Mr. Hobart denies that the Trustees have directed
that the front campus be converted into a minature golf
course, thereby squelching the rumors that the Great
Gray Golfer has been asked to occupy the empty white
house on North Main Street. Guess we'll have to keep look-

ing.
When in doubt...

candiate whose scores are be-
low 40C, regardless of the ex-
cellence of his. high school
record, has fess than a fifty:
fifty chance.”

“Academic potential
atone, however, is not
enought to guarantee asd-
mission. The committee is
vitally interested in the
answer to its second quest-
ion: What kind of citizen
has the applicant been in
his high school or prep
school community? To ask
this question is not to de-
mand by implication that he
be a major office-holder or
captain of his football team;
it does imply that he
should have contributed in
some way — through ath-
fetics, clubs, student gov-
ernment, publications,
music, or other areas of
secondary school life out-
side the classroom.”
Applicants must also be

recommendad by secondary
school authorilies as to such
personal qualities as eharacter,
conduet, and attitude.

ALUMNI PREFERENCE

“While academic and citizen-
ship potential are the two most
important. factors in a student's
admissions picture, the admis-
sions committee also takes
stock of’ possible obligations to
the boy on the part of the col-
lege Quite «naturally,
the son of an alumnus has
something of an edge on the
boy who has no such connec-
tion. Similarly, while there is
no attempt to set artificial lim-
itations or quotas based on
geography or religious denomi-
nation, the fact that a boy is
a North Carolina or Florida
Presbyterian may give him pre-
ference if all other things are
equal.”

THREE TO ONE

Of the 700-plus applicants
each year, approximately 150
do not complete the admissions
process, 150 are rejected, and
400 are accepted. Of those ac-

another school. and 250 enter

points higher than the average
at Davidson. Whereas David-
son is graduating fewer than
75 oer cent of the students who
enroll as freshmen, some _in-

concludes, the present David- .

sulted in a reduction from past
years of the. exclusions for
academic failure during the
freshman year and of the totat
withdrawals during the first
two years of college, and there
has been a marked rise in the
quality of scholastic attain-

E Pluribus and «42

‘The Gentleman’ |

®

By JOHN BERNHARDT

In following up the analysis
of the Davidson student as
“homogenized or pasteurized”,
jet us look at the homogenate.

Davidson probably does turn
out an abnormally large num-
ber of its typed product. the
“gentleman”: -this would indi-
cate a strong influence of the
group on the individual. Sur-
prisingly, though, there is no
fecling of obligation to society
involved in the conformity with
it.

MERELY NEGATIVE

We feel we must not antago-
nize the group be being dif-
ferent, but we see ourselves as
separate from the other individ-
uals in it. with society and its
requirements as merely a neg-
ative obligation. We feel we
have no positive obligation to
help.

This problem of unity versus
individualism is really one in-
volving our national society and
its attitude. There is the prob-
lem of States’ Rights versus
National Strength. There is con-
trolled prices. subsidized farm-
ing, and socialized pensions ver-
sus laissez-faire capitalism and
bureaucratic bigness in organi-
zation. In spite of the idea of
“£ Pluribus Unum", we general-
ly take the side of individual-
ism against the larger group in
these controversies.

OUR GROUP FIRST!

Here at Davidson we certainty
our own smaller group over any
larger one. In fraternities. we
are interested only in our own,
and the system as a whole rare-

By Schulz

HOW WOULD YOU LOOK IF
YOUR WHOLE NERVOUS
WAS SHOT?

SYSTEM

ly affects us. We hate regula-
tions put on us, ‘even when they
are for our own group-good.

A Preferential-bidding system
seems bad partly because of
this feeling. Any suggestion
that the authorities are cutting
down our individual “rights:'
for the good of the rest of the
school is met as though an in-
justice were being done. We
like to have all the. rights to
our individual selves rather
than for the whole group.

Sometimes, it seems, not on-
ly does our right hand not know
what our left hand is doing, but
it doesn't even care. We borrow
books from the library, seribble
on them, and return them with
no thought of what the next
person would like. The paper
cups and cigarette packs thrown
around the campus show we
aren't very- worried about what
others want.

HONOR SYSTEM

But the major example of
this attitude lies in the honor
system, where there is more
and more disregard for the
group-system for the sake of
an individual. Clothes from the
sym, books from the library,
pencils from the Union, news-
papers from the piles for sale
—all these are being taken by
boys who do not stop to think
of the group but only of them-
selves,

Maybe these illustrations
over-state the case, but we do
prefer the individual to the
sroup, in practice. Is there any-
thing wrong with this attitude,
since it seems so widespread?

PARADOX

It is at feast strange that,
with the Christian doctrine of
the Golden Rule and the Sec-
ond Mile, and with our empha-
sis here on fraternity and
brotherhood, we do not see a
paradox in our position that
each man is an island, entire
unto himself. With our pressure
here for conformity to the
group, it is odd that we do not
feel a parallel emphasis on duty
to the group.
