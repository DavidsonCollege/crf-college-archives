Secret Sentence. By Vicki Baum. Double-
day, Doran and Company. 1932.

Gan a man, by his mode of living after a
crime, reconcile himself in the eyes of so-
ciety? This question has arisen often upon
the occasion of the discovery and apprehen-
sion of a man who at some time in the dis-
tant past was wanted for a crime, but who
afterwards has lived an honest and useful
life.

Frau Baum treats this theme in a novel!
which better-in characterization of the
criminal than in the action of the story
Is the man who killed the minister really
a criminal, since through the propaganda of
a secret society he was convinced that -the
man was an enemy the welfare of his
country ?

The book is vivid in its recounting of the
precarious existence of the fugitive from the
law. He finds in a mine a temporary re-
treat, but the authorities trace his trail and
he is forced to move on, Very life-like and
realistic are the escapes and the terrible life
of an outlaw.

In dealing with her subject, Frau Baum
divides the book into three parts: The Deed,
Flight, and Expiation. The first part por-
trays the gradual “working up” of Joachim
to the point’ where he is willing to commit
the crime. He is influenced by his com-
panions. Because they consider him incapa-
ble of the deed, he seeks to show them. This
desire to prove himself loyal preys upon his
mind until he commits the murder. Conse-
quently he makes his escape when the situa-
tion becomes tense.

The second part relates the perils incident
to the flight, the precautions against ‘identi-
fication, and the necessity of isolating him-
self from his fellowmen. The law is an un-
relenting pursuer and the criminal the de-
termined fugitive.

The last division tells ‘how after his re-
turn from a sojourn in America he re-es-
tablishes his life. He settles in a quiet fish
ing village and through patience, knowledge.
kindness and character, he reinstates him
self as a useful and worthy citizen. The
climax comes when he meets his former alls’
in the secret society, the man largely re
sponsible for his committing the crime. THe
is offered a chance to regain his former rank
in the society, but he refuses, to remain in
the little fishing colony to serve his  self-
imposed “secret sentence.”

The. author has related the events of the
story so that the reader feels that he has
experienced them, and follows the central
figure with great. interést. The characters
are mostly from the lower class and they
are natural and well depicted. The novel,
while a most engrossing story on the sub-
ject, leaves the question open. This partic-
ular man served sentence for the remainder
of his life by separating himself from fam-
ily, friends and society. Was, then, his crime
expiated?, During his‘ period of expiation
it seems that everything would culminate
in complete happiness. The man, Joachim,
lives a life of toil. He has no goal toward
which to aim but finds a measure of solace
in hard work. He has no social ambition,
no desire for material wealth. His love af-
fair alsomends unfavorably, Thus he im-
prisons himself from the joys of life in “se-
cret sentence.”

declared that Socialism is not to be confused
with Bolshevism. He stated that, although |
the party could not hope to get into power |
in November, a vote would be more than}
a protest and would not be wasted. It would}
help to build up a party in the future. He
showed that goverfimet control of industries
was practical and-a-movement that would
eliminate many industrial evils. He praised
Norman Thomas, the Socialist condidate, as
a man who had sacrificed his political future
to a principle.

Richards, in speaking for the Democrats, |
showed that their platform was clear-cut and
left no room for doubt on its issues. He
flayed the Republicans because of their in-
decision and tendency to straddle questions.
He showed the marked tendency. toward
lawlessness under the Republican regime
and predicted that people, tired of this state
of_affairs, would turn to Roosevelt—and the
Democrats in November. He stated that
Roosevelt was a man of progressive prin-
ciples and would take/ the place of the other
great Democratic leaders in a time of crisis.

Several new members were initiated into
membership of the society.

have been assigned seats and absences re-

This is to involve the use of printed cards

They will sign these and turn them in to the
Committee, thereby enabling the
