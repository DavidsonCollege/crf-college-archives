Upcoming films present trendy Buddha and Clint Eastwood in a glove

By NICK GRAHAM

This Friday in Love the Pop
Films Committee kicks off their
Winter Season with what is
probably the weakest feature in

an otherwise excellent selection
which ranges from the high-
class thud and blunder of The
Spy Who Loved Me to the near-
perfection of Annie Hall and
Being There. The opening film,

Clockwork will be at PAX at 9:00 Thursday night.

Clint Eastwood’s The Gauntlet
features the man himself in
what may be his most bafflingly
ambiguous production. If this
display of ponderously inarticu-
late energy is indeed being

served up as genuine mass-mar-
ket pulp then it is probably his
weakest vehicle since the early
and justifiably neglected Two
Mule for Sister Sarah—now

/usualy trotted out at Eastwood

all-nighters as a curio from his

‘““dynamite-and-cigars” days.
However, once the viewer

recalls Every Which Way But

Loose and starts to regard the -

whole thing as calculated self-
parody, then the film gains a
new dimension and becomes
positively pleasurable. Clint ad-
dicts (they are many, and
probably baying for my blood at

this moment) will go to see it
anyway: for the less committed,
I'd recommend it, if only to let
you decide for yourselves how
comic it really is: I just can’t
make up my mind. Either
way, Eastwood had done more
than anybody else in the last
twenty years to turn the B-fea-
ture into a respectable art, and
when he’s on form in‘ his own
genre, nobody does it better.
The Fine Film offering for
Wednesday, 10th December, is
a rather different matter. Sidd-
hartha is adapted from Herman
Hesse’s popular novel of the

NCPIRG financial problems exist in chapters nationwide

(CPS) At Indiana University,’

InPIRG—the Indiana Public
Interest Research Group—has
received less than half of the
student backing it got last year.
If the trend continues, its
staffers say, it could be out of
business by this time next year.

Iowa State University’s citi-
zen research organization—
IPIRG—collected $9000 from
student fees in 1979, compared
to $18,000 in 1978. This semes-
ter, it raised the student fee
from one to two dollars. It
hasn't helped.

And at Davidson College in
North Carolina, the PIRG chap-
ter barely has been kept alive by
a massive publicity drive that
may have already reached its
peak.

From these indications, it
appears that PIRG branches
across the nation are stagger-
ing. Buffeted by administrative
opposition and perhaps student
apathy, the public interest re-
search movement, begun in
1970 by consumer activist
Ralph Nader, may have run its
course at several campuses.

_. But-in Washington, a Nader
aide says the PIRG network, if
anything, has become stronger
in the last two years, and has
“improved its techniques from
lobbying to recruiting.” -

“PIRGs are increasing their
sophistication,” contends. aide
David Jones, ‘‘and they seem
to be coming more skilled in the
ways they deal with social
problems.”

Jones even brags that a.

recent count shows PIRG has
spread to approximately 140
chapters in 25 states. He indi-

cates that is a clear signal that
the student consumer move-
ment to fight the huge and
powerful utilities and certain
private companies is gaining
momentum.

Yet three of the new chapters
Jones cited as examples of
growth do not seem very well
endowed for battles with big
business. One new branch, at
Framingham State College in
Massachusetts, consists of a-
bout 10 volunteers who sit at a
table on campus several hours a
week. They have no phone or
office. Their pamphlets and
other equipment are stored in
the campus women’s center.
Two other new branches also do
not have offices.

Moreover, students have ac-
tively rejected establishing
PIRG chapters at several uni-
versities. A measure to allow a
CALPIRG funding check-off
box on UCLA registration
forms failed by a spare 33 votes
last May. At Rutgers, three law
students have begun a class
action suit to make PIRG
funding there voluntary.

And if things don’t get better.
soon at Indiana, the PIRG
effort there may be reduced to

the same sort of homeless |
status as some of its newer,
. sister branches.

In 1979, 11 percent of the
Indiana students marked its
support for the group in the
regular registration form, con-
tributing $1.50 per person to
the campaign. But even though
this semester’s fee was hiked to
$2, PIRG only raised about 70

percent of the amount it got last _
‘year. More ominously, the

group failed to receive the
support of 10 percent of the

campus population. Conse-
quently it could lose. its position
on the university’s registration
forms next year. Without that
listing, the group would face
certain disaster, according to
staff director Dan Howell.

This year’s loss of revenue—
from nearly $6000 to $4200—
coupled with the threat of losing
its place on the registration
form has frightened Howell into
believing that it may be forced
to become an all-volunteer or-
ganization next year.

“If we don’t have enough
money to hire someone with
solid research skills,’’ Howell
says, ‘‘and some knowledge of
legislative activities, then we
can’t be effective.”

Howell says he admires the
dedication of volunteer stu-

- dents, but complains ’’they just

do not -have the expertise that
PIRG needs.”

The blame for the group’s
failure to raise adequate funds
and garner student support,
Howell contends, belongs to the
school’s administrators. He
points to a number of admin-
istrative technicalities which
made the registration form
more complex, and thus more
difficult for students to affirm
their support.

“The box for marking ‘no’
was before the one with ‘yes,’
and the Pirg listing was: ex-
plained at the same table with

‘other things on the form. It

made everything so compli-
cated,” he argues.

But his discontent centers
around what he calls the ad-
ministration’s’ ‘‘opposition to
our goals.’’ He says that
PIRG’s attacks on the big
industries and utilities in town

have generated local business
pressures on the university to
curtail PIRG’s effectiveness.

same name which purports to
trace the Buddha’s search for
enlightenment. The major trou-
ble with this treatment is that
the struggle toward nirvana is
too often abandoned in order to
allow the camera to dwell upon
the picture-postcard views of
the India-Land-of-Contrasts
variety. The blame for this
undeniably stunning opulence is
usually laid firmly at the door of ©
Sven Nykvist, Bergman’s regu-
lar lensman, who directed the
photography here. In fact the
Swede probably emerges from
the affair with more credit than
anybody else, because the
scenes which attempt to grapple
with the complexities of Budd-
hism tend to do for the way of
Enlightenment what King of
Kings did for Christianity.
Whether this means that

treatment remains to be seen,
but if an India which conforms
to Federal Hygiene Laws, and
platitudes which make Allen

sus appeal to you, then this
Buddha’s for you. While the
visual attractions are immedi-
ately seductive and ultimately
uplifting, this film is a dire
warning to those who seek to
capitalise upon novels fashiona-
