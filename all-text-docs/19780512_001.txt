Board of Trustees
holds final meeting

By LYNN PEACE
Staff Writer

Investments discussed

The Board of Trustees closed out the year with their
meeting this past weekend. They discussed investment
responsibility, tenure and promotion decisions, and
gifts among other things.

“It was not a particularly exciting meeting,” said
College President Samuel R. Spencer, Jr.

The Investment and Management Committee (IMC)
presented a general statement of Endowment Invest-
ment responsibility to the Board of Trustees:

‘Maximum financial return over the long run is the
primary criterion underlying all decisions to ‘buy’ or
‘sell.’ A decision to ‘buy,’ ‘not to buy,’ or to ‘sell’ for
other than financial reasons will be made only in cases
where the college determines that such investments are
or would be clearly immoral.” i

“There was a wide range of opinions on the issue,”’
said Spencer. ‘‘A major argument was the difficulty of
making the judgment of what an immoral action is.”

“There isn’t a company that isn’t immoral,” quipped
Dean of Students Will Terry.

There was also a general concern over knowing the
best way to meet social responsibility.

According to Spencer, there were two major opinions
among the Trustees: (1) that there should not be a
specific statement of social responsibility at all, or (2)
that the statement adopted by the IMC should be
strengthened.

‘The Trustees were afraid that this statement would
raise more problems than it would solve and therefore
the Board decided to wait until a better statement is
recommended,” explained Spencer.

The Board moved to refer the issue of an investement
statement back to the Finance Committee for further
consideration. The committee will make its recommen-
dations to the Trustees in the fall.

“Meanwhile, the college’s investments will remain on
the total return principle,’’ said Spencer.

‘This is the first year that our returns have exceeded
the five per cent takeout,” remarked Spencer. ‘‘The
excess will be put back in the endowment rather than

selling the stock to use for operational purposes,” \he
added.

New faculty approved

The Board of Trustees finalized the appointment of
new professors in the Departments of Religion,
Physics, and French in their meeting last week. The
Departments of Psychology and Sociology, meanwhile,
continue their search.

Professor of Psychology John E. Kello described the
situation of the Psychology Department.

‘The only candidate to which we made an offer
already had two other offers,’’ said Kello. ‘‘He took an
appointment at a major state university,’’ Kello
explained.

‘‘We still have one more prime prospect still
available,’’ he commented. ‘‘We’re hopeful.’’

Kello speculated that if this prospect doesn’t work
out, the department will likely make a temporary
appointment and go through the search again next
year.

The Sociology Department looked closely at three
candidates, but ‘‘none of them had the right
combination of qualities to take the position,’’ said Vice
President for, Academic Affairs T.C. Price Zimmer-
mann.

“Tt’s a particularly sensitive choice,’’ Zimmermann
said. ‘‘The position is tenured with the responsibility of

| the leadership of the department.”

‘‘We want someone who we’re absolutely enthusias-

Proposal
for tenure
committee
referred
to PAC

By CAROL LOPTSON
Staff Writer

The faculty voted 38 to 25 to
send Professor of Philosophy
Earl MacCormac’s proposal for
a tenure committee to the
Professional Affairs Committee
(PAC) to consider it as a
possible addition to the propos-
ed Code of Evaluation. The vote
took place at the faculty meet-
ing Tuesday.

The PAC will study the
proposal and eventually make a
recommendation to the faculty.
The faculty will have an oppor-
tunity to discuss it and make
changes in it. The faculty will
then vote on the proposal.

According to Professor of
Sociology Norman B. Koller,
“The PAC does not seem at all
hostile to including it in the
Code of Evaluation.”’

MacCormac said, ‘‘I’m still
hopeful. I would have preferred
to have a vote on my proposal
by the faculty Tuesday at the

Media Board okays request

By DONALD CALDWELL
Staff Writer

The Media Board convened
Tuesday morning to approve
Philip Duncan’s request for
reinstatement as Davidsonian
editor at the end of this term.

The request follows a refusal
by the Review Board to repeal
Duncan’s present probation. _

Much of the Board’s discus-
sion centered on the newspa-
per’s credibility should he re-
turn.

Member Tom Bessellieu com-
mented, ‘‘I feel The Davidsoni-
an’s credibility will only be
suspect to those who have
formed their opinion on rumour
and oversimplifications of what
happened.”’

‘‘As for those who aren’t
sure, I hope they will base their
opinion on both the facts about
this incident and the quality of
the paper next September.”

Duncan’s defense advisor
Harry Greyard read from a
prepared statement, as Duncan
was unable to attend due to
illness.

The following is Duncan’s
statement, released Tuesday
afternoon:

“After a hearing last Mon-
day, the Review Board upheld
the Hearing Committee’s impo-
sition of the sanction of proba-
tion stemming from my viola-
tion of Section IV of the Code of
Responsibility.

“According to the Code of
Disciplinary Procedures, { have

the option of appealing to the
President of the College. Today
I am announcing my intent
not to exercise that option.

“T appealed the hearing Com-
mittee’s imposition of sanction
at the urging of my parents and
some friends and‘ faculty who
questioned if the punishment of
probation for a term was consis-
tent with the nature of my
violation.

“The Review Board deter-
mined that the punishment was
consistent with the deed, and I
respect and shall abide by their
decision.

“During the period of my
leave of absence from the edi-
torship, I often considered what
actions I should take if the
Review Board upheld the sanc-
tion of probation for Spring
term. After much thought, I
today request the Media Board
to allow me to resume my
duties as editor at the conclu-
sion of this term.

“I have no doubt that my
violation of the Code of Respon-
sibility has to some degree
compromised my effectiveness
in the position of editor of The
Davidsonian. But I also have no
doubt that, given the opportu-
nity to return to the editorship,
I can restore the confidence of
the citizens of the College.
Solicitor Hans Watford remark-
ed during the proceedings that
“actions are the measure of the
man.”

“After taking the Code of

Evaluation from Dr. Wolf’s
box, I have attempted through
my actions to demonstrate my
respect for the standards of
trust which make this commun-
ity unique. By not printing the
offending article about the
Code, by pleading guilty as
charged and cooperating fully in
a public hearing of my case, and
by voluntarily stepping from
editorship during the proceed-
ings, I have endeavored to
atone for my original misstep
and bear out my conviction that
Davidson’s unique standards
are worth upholding.

“Let me return to the editor-
ship and prove though my
actions in that position that
good journalism is possible
within the context of our com-
munity’s high standards.

“T beg your indulgence one
last time. This is an appropriate
forum in which to publicly
express gratitude to all who
have helped me through the
past weeks.

“Only those who know me
will realize how important The
Davidsonian is to me, and only
they understand how difficult it
has been for me to stand on the
sidelines after nearly three
years of daily involvement with
the newspaper.

‘‘But many people, friends
and acquaintances alike, have
bolstered my spirits when they
have been low. No one failed to
condemn my violation, but all
