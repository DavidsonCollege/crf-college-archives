Davidson's Inter-fraternity winter-sports program got un:
derway last Tuesday night with the swimming meet, and as
usual, the old question of eligibility is already starting to
come up. The student body (for the most part) has been given
no definite rules concerning eligibility as set up by the Sports
Managers, and several mix-ups always occur during the winter
activity. The eligibility committee has established a set of
rules which have been pretty standard for quite a few years.
The rules committee has also set the law concerning such
things as Protests, Forfeits, Postponements, and the point sys-
tem to be used in each sport.

Next week, The Davidsonian will publish the rules con-
cerning major points on which most students seem to be con-
fused, and we hope that students will take advantage of this
opportunity to acquaint themselves with these rules. This
publication is also being made in an attempt to call to students’
attention several points which could, it seems, be improved.

As the system stands now, the rules are sometimes rather
vague and can be easily misinterpreted, and some could be
only slightly changed to make a terrific improvement in the
inter-fraternity program.

Any changes made, of course, will take a lot of hard work,
but any improvement made would be worth the effort. It
was shown this fall that the rules are not perfect, when the
entire tennis program was overhauled for a better system.
This move came as a direct result of student interest, and any
further change in the system will come only through the same
channel. The Sports Managers, not the Athletic Office, should
be given the complaints of students sincé these represent-
atives make the rules. If there is no pressure from students,
there will be no change. The matter is entirely in the hands
of the students. Perhaps the present complaints do not repre-
sent the sentiment of the entire student body, and only by
our action can the Sports Managers know what action, if any,
to take. So let’s let our representatives know any of the parts
we don’t like and get them changed.

Across the nation, winter sports have gotten started in
fine style, and already several predictions have been made
concerning national champions and basketball All-Americans.
Davidson’s cagers got the local ball rolling up at Guilford last
night, and the home slate opens next Monday when the Quak-
ers return the visit. But as all the hustle and bustle over win-
ter sports begins, the national football situation still holds the
major spotlight. The bowl games have selected all their op-
ponents, and the college bowl schedule gets under way to-
morrow, with the Potato Bowl and Orange Blossom Festival
being the first. After a long, dizzy spin, the bowl season ends
on January 8, with the Senior Bowl marking the final major
clash.

Carolina fans will get a look at the top prep players in
North and South Carolina tomorrow at the annual Shrine Bow]
in Charlotte, with proceeds going to the Crippled Children’s
Hospital in Greenville, S. C. The classic is a top-flight attrac-
tion and always provides the best in high school football.

Next week’s issue of The Davidsonian will bring out a new
feature which will continue throughout the winter sports sea-
son. In each issue, a five-man delegation chosen at random
from the student body will attempt to select the winners on
a 10-15 game card taken from outstanding basketball games
in this area each week. Five members of the sports staff are
going to start the ball rolling by sticking their necks out on
the first card, possibly to get them cut off. With the many
closely-matched teams in the area, picking the winners could
be quite a job, and the winners ofthe contests will have to
be very adept (or lucky as the case may be.) The names of
the winners will be published each week, but no prizes will
be given since that would make the contest illegal under
student gambling regulations.

Hobby Cobb Buckets 39
As Quakers Fall, 94-73

By JIM HOLSHOUSER

Davidson's varsity basketball team opened its 1954-55
season last night by defeating the Guilford Quakers, 94-73.
The outcome of the contest, which was supposed to be pretty
close, was never in doubt after the early minutes of the sec-
ond half when the Wildcats moved ahead by a wide margin,
never to be threatened again. The Davidson club held a five-

point lead at half-time and definitely had control of the game.

SAEs Cop Swim Meel;
Kappa Sigs Take 2nd

By LEON HOWELL

The fraternity swimming meet
ushered in the winter sports sea-
son here at Davidson Tuesday and
Wednesday night. In a meet marked
by its stiff competition, John Win-
frey and Henry Brown led the
SAE’s to victory. The individual
spot-light was grabbed by Don
Stewart, who turned in the only
record-breaking performance in
winning the 50 yard back stroke.

The top four teams were SAE
with 26 points, Kappa Sig with
10%, Phi Delt with 16% and Phi
Gam’s with 8.

The results by event were:

180 yard medley—Kappa Sig—
1:39.6.

25 yard free style—Brown and
Winfrey (tie)}—SAE—:11.9.

SC Race Promises |
To Be Good One;

By BOB PULLIAM

It was a wild and exciting con-
test, with the Guilford coach leav-
ng the game midway in the last

alf in protest to a call by the offi-
elale The Guilford crowd continu-
ally heckled the Davidson players,
but the Wildcat cagers kept ane
the baskets just the same.
Quakers tried a desperate, back-
court press in the final quarter,
but the move failed as the David-
son guards continually worked the
ball easily into the fore-court.

Coach Meredith of Guilford and
Referee Dolan Hedrick will have a
chance to resume their argument
Monday when both men will be
at their posts for the game here.

For Davidson, Hobby Cobb was
the hero, pumping in 14 field goals
and 11 free throws for a tremend-
ous total of 39 points. After a big,
22-point first half by Cobb, the
Guilford defense doubled up on
the Charlotte boy in the final per-
fod, but Hobby continued to score
despite the move. Ray Harding
and Richard Weeks did a fine job
of helping the Cat scoring punch,
and Gaylord Walker played a top-
flight game under the boards, get-
ting more than his share of the
rebounds.

Coach Danny Miller used the en-
tire traveling squad in the scrap.
Only Ish Bermett did not get into
the game. Ish had a badly-sprained
foot, a result of an accident in
practice earlier this week. The
West Virginia forward may miss
the return game with Guilford
next Monday night, but he will
probably be set to make the pre-
holiday trip next week. His pres-
ence in the Davidson line-up will
definitely strengthen the Wildcat
chances.

Davidson has just completed its
most successful football season in
recent years, a season which will
long be remembered by the play-
ers and students alike. Those who
will probably remember it longest
are the seven Seniors who ended
their college football careers here
two week-ends ago.

The first in alphabetical order
is Henry Brown, 175-pound full-
back from Carrollton, Ga., who
came into his own this year as a
star runner. Henry ran at the quar-
terback spot in 1953, but his return
to the fullback position this sea-
son was'one of the best moves
made by Coach Bill Dole. Henry
finished the season in fourth place

rushing, and he was the leading
ground-gainer for the Cats.

Dickie Davis, hailing from Spin-
dale, N. C., is probably the tough-
est 180 pounds Davidson opponents
met all year. One of the scrappiest
guards to perform here in many
years, Dickie was the Captain of
this year's Cats, and the record
of the team is some indication of
the fine job he did. Though ham-
pered by a knee injury in the
early part of the season, he came
on to finish a brilliant career in
great style. His dependability and
never-say-die spirit will be sorely
missed when Davidson takes the
field next fall.

Jim Fasul, returning to the squad
after a hitch in the Marines, was
an outstanding guard on this year’s

eleven, having won his letter in
1950. Fasul was on Coach Dole's
great championship team at Fay-
etteville High School in 1047, and
his performance this year showed
one reason that the Fayetteville
club did so well. His outstanding
play this season earned him Hon-
orable Mention on the All-Southern
Conference squad.

Corky King, 169-pound end from
Burlington, is a typical example of
the type player that gave Davidson
its fine season. When a player ran
out of steam in earlier years, he
simply had to stay in and take it,
or let the coach send in a “second-
rate” player. This year, Davidson
could substitute freely without

of ball for Davidson under Dole’s
two-unit system. He played excep-
tionally well on defense and will
certainly be missed next season.

Harry Petersen, known much
more widely as “Pete”, has had a
brilliant career at Davidson de-
spite many injuries. Weighing 234
pounds, Pete has provided the
needed strength and size in the
Davidson line, and it has told the
story in some of the scores this
season. He had more tough breaks
and injuries than Carter has pills,
but he never failed to return to
the line-up and give it all he had.
This year, he was sidelined for
the first few games with a bad
leg, but he ended his playing days

dropping the quality of players in; with tremendous performances in

the line-up, and Corky played a lot.
