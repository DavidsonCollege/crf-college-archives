““The mighty oak from a

Committee Says Papers
Should Be Independent

A commission which has
been studying campus news
papers of nine campuses of
the University of California
has concluded that the pa-
pers studied should seek fis-
cal independence and should
not be officially controlled
by their institutions.

‘The report of the commit-
tee said that the biggest
problems of student news-
papers result from inept, in-
experienced, and overwork-
ed newspaper staffs. Ob-
scenity in campus newspa-
pers was dismissed by the
report as a minor problem.

“Across the nation,’ said
the report, “‘‘there are a-
bundant examples of student
newspapers that have led
the way in exposing evils
and achieving improvements
on campus and in dormi-
tories.

“There are also plentiful
examples of ineptness, un-
fairness, and other excesses.
The one is the price of the
other—just as in journalism
at darge. -

The commission was
charged by Nolan E. Isaacs,
executive editor of the Louis-
ville Courier - Journal and

president of the American
Society of Newspaper Edi-
tors.

Look magazine editor Wil-

liam B. Arthur, Boston
Globe editor Thomas Win
ship, and Edward W. Bar-

ret, director of the commun-

committee.

The commission concludes
that ‘‘many of the concerns,
disagreements, and ex-
changes of accusations with-
in the University of Califor-
nia system and its student
publications flow from an
afronous premise . . . that
student publications neces-
sarily constitute a form of
official publications for
which university administra-
tors bear inherent responsi-
bility.”

Montoya To Play
Concert In Love

Carlos Montoya, world
famous guitarist who made
flamenco “music an art in
itself, will present an Artist
Series concert in Love Audi-

staring at, 2 rom. .Wednes-
day.

Montoya, a Spanish gypsy
born in Madrid, was a mus-
ical prodigy as a child,
achieving national renown
by age of 14 during the hey-
day of flamenco singing and
dancing in. Spain.

Prior to Montoya’s time,
flamenco guitarists played
only brief accomplishments
or chords for singers and
dancers. But he was the
first such guitarist to give
a solo performance, impro-
vising and expanding on the
themes of the
" background music to make
it an art in its own right.
Since then he has written
‘hundreds of flamenco pieces,

flamenco '

but still does a great deal
of improvising at each per-
formance.

Usually his. programs fea-
ture traditional descriptive
titles ‘suth as algerias, “bul-
eria, farruca (all of which
refer to dance-rhythms);. or

tarantes, granainas and pe-
teneras (songs).
Under each category he

presents a unique combina-

tion of music for each pro-
gram. While the selections
are all .his own compositions,
they all are derived from
traditional themes.

Montoya has taken his
flamenco music all ovef the
world, and has won thunder-
ous applause and enraptur-
ed audiences everywhere. In
Addition he has recorded
many records and tapes
which have been. distribut-
ed around the globe.

in its report.

It proposed, instead,
the university use
al newsletters to
“official

that
occasion-
eirculate
Statements,  inter-
and news as ap-
on each campus.”

It hastened to

such publications ‘‘should
not be .used as’ reason or
excuse for attempting to
exclude .student journalistic
enterprise; or to discourage
campus journalism; or to
reduce funds presently al-
located for this student ac-
tivity.

“Nor should publication of
such newsletters be so fre-
quent or be so complete as
to seem either to compete
with student journ or to
relieve them of Me oi
gations to provide full, fair,
and honest news reporting.”

The
“only

commission found
sporadic use of lan-
guage difficult for the older
Beneration to accept’’_in the
150 newspapers it subjected
to scrutiny.

According to the commis-
sion, “‘all those concerned
with the publication of a

principal campus newspa-
per should . . . think through
what its’ role should be,

agree on a basic set of prin-
ciples, and then accord the
editors as much freedom as
possible
ciples.”
The commsision then list-
ed the specific principles.
“A clear distinction be-

tween news columns and
editorial comment.”

‘*'Endeavoring con-

scientiously to give the
readership a full and fair
report of development on

“Faithful coverage of both
sides —or, indeed, all sides—

“Competent coverage of

sense that a responsible city
daily reports the statements

dent.”

“This. was all an_ out-
growth of the Community

Relations Committee set up

by the mayor of Davidson _

in 1963,"' Rhodes explained.
“We Made a study of the
needs of*'the.community and
found that
for low-income individuals
was a primary need. The
problem was that we had to
buy the land first.”

Rhodes said that several
town leaders set up a non-
profit Davidson Communi-
ty Development Corporation

to buy the land. A’ site own- ;

ed by Duke Power Company

was chosen just east of
town.
Money for the land was

loaned on an_ interest-free
basis by Bridgeport Fabrics
of Davidson. A purchase by

of lots for its employees
gave the corporation some
starting capital.

Dear Mr: Rhodes:

The mighty oak from a little acorn grew is

a time worn axiom, but it aptly describes what,
you and your committee have accomplished for
© the low-income people of the nation.

Recent legisjation passed by the Congress
© of the United States and signed by the President
* gives authority ‘to rural communities to receive

as

assistance in developing adequate building sites
for low-income people.

This idea and accomplishment was initiated
by you and your group who set the pattern for
this badly needed legislation.

I think it is noteworthy for the people in
your community to realize that the Federal Gov-
ernment is sensitive to practical, workable ap-
proaches that local people initiate and carry out.

Along with the Farmers Home county peo-
ple may I congratulate you again on this idea
‘ of a non-profit association being formed so that

adequate sites can be developed for people in
need ‘of improved housing.

Thank you especially for the contributions

made by Mr. H. B. Naramore, Mr. T. S. Sadler,

Mr. W.

Very truly yours,
Robert W. Fleetwood

The office of student hous-

selors and will continue to
do so until the filing dead-

According to Mrs. Peter
Nicholls, the director of stu-

ing: juniors and seniors have
takem application forms, and
she predicts a large number
of applications for the 22-to-

Mrs. Nicholls stated,

Students Evaluate Teachers
For Advancement, Tenure

St. Louis, Mo. —
Student evaluations will be
added to the criteria used
by the St. Louis University
committee on academic rank
and tenure in making de-
cisions on faculty promo-
tions and granting of tenure.

The committee's action
was announced recently, by
the Rev. John W. Padberg,
S. J., chairman of the com
mittee, in a letter to all
full-time ranked faculty
members.

Father Padberg said the
committee on academic
rank and tenure sees the de-

(L.P.)

cision as “an Opportunity of —

enlisting more members of
the University community in
a significant contribution to
the University’s advance-
ment in excellence.”

He said the committee al-
so viewed it, in part, as a
response to the concern
voiced at the President's
Faculty Conference in Sep-
tember that ‘“‘the quality of
teaching and ‘its improye-
ment should be a matter of
continuing concern.”

The student evaluations
will be taken into~consider-
ation along with the evalua-
tions of ‘two of the faculty
member's . colleagues, his
dean “and his: department
chairman which are sub-
_Mitted to the committee on
academic rank and tenure
which makes the decision on
promotions and tenure. &

At least four student eval-
uations will ‘be requested for
each faculty member being
considered for promotion.
Three of the students will
be chosen by the chairman
of the faculty member's de-
partment and one will be
chosen by. the faculty” mern-
ber himself;

The evaluation form to be
used by the students will
differ from those used by
the colleagues, chairman
and dean ‘in that it will ask
specifically for the student's
comments on the faculty
member's teaching. The
forms carry information on
the actiyities in research,
publication, consultation and
advisement which are ex-
pected of every
member.

faculty

The—-eommittee—emphasiz=
ed that as in the past, no
one would be advanced in
rank or denied promotion
simply on an isolated evalu-

ation of any kind. The stu-
dent evaluations will be
used beginning with the 1970
71 academic year.

_ point average;

the selection process will be
especially rigid this year.

The selection committee
consists of Dean of Students
Richard C, Burts Jr., Wijl-
liam B. Hight Jr., director
of student counseling, Union
Director C. Shaw Smith,
Chaplain Chaplain R. Scott
Woodmansee and all gradu-
ating hall counselors.

Mrs. Nicholls added,
“What we look for is a
spnuine concern for others

und their problems.”
However, another prime
consideration for the selec-
tion of the counselors is an
estimation of the’ amount of
time that the student could
afford to spend. For _ in-
stance, a student should
have at least a 2.0 grade
otherwise the
selection board would be re-

luctant to consider him be-
cause his time could be
better spent studying.

The selection will be made
on Mar. 5 and letters of
acceptance will be mailed
so that they will reach the
student Mar. 6.

Mrs. Nicholls noted, ‘‘It is
heartwarming to see such
a great interest by these
students to fill this most

cruicial function, I
tain that our
program will
next year."
Mrs. Nicholls has also
sent out letters requesting
students to volunteer to “be
the roommates of the twelve
international students who
come to the college each
year as part of Davidson's
exchange program.
