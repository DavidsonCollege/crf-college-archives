Goodbye

In about three short weeks a group, the
seniors, will leave the Davidson campus for-
ever. Of course some of them will return
from time to time for dances, football
games, ete., but they will no longer be an
actual part of the student body. To some
of them Commencement is a happy time of
their dife, but to-most of them it is a sor-
rowful occasion, Naturally they’re glad to
get their sheepskins and they feel that four,
short years, of hard work has given them
new ideas, opportunities, and slants on life.
But deep down in their hearts they hate to
leave.

The three lower classes, however, will
feel their absence more than anyone though,
Some of the seniors have been their bud-
dies and friends, during their short stay and
without them around things will be differ-
ent. But seniors, we have to bid you fare-
well but we hope that: your life will be as
successful after you get your sheepskin as
it was during your four years’ stay at Da-
vidson.

An Old Subject

Maybe its spring—maybe because its so
near the end of school, but each year its the
same old story, Chapel conduct. Maybe this
subject should be left alone, but every year
about this time it rises to a peak. Numer-
ous chapel talks, editorials, letters to the
editor, etc, have been presented—yet all
of them to no avail.

To cite a particular case—Saturday morn-
ing. A new face, one of our newly elected
men, stepped up to read announcements.
Certainly it was not an easy task for him
to stand up for the first time and read off
notices. Certain parties of the student body,
realizing that this man was new, (and also
thinking that they would be “cute”) politely

Campus Comments

The days of the Class of 1939 as a part
of Davidson College are numbered, for four
years have sped by until now we are faced
with the grim realities of the outside world.
Our thoughts in the past few weeks have
not been disturbed much with Davidson be-
cause we have been thinking of.our futures
—with anticipation or trepidation—but oc-
casionally there are some of us who are
wont to rest from our considerations of the

future by momentary glances in retrospect.

We would like to say that we have help-
ed our College, in some small way at least.
Perhaps we have. Still that is not the main
issue, for we came to Davidson, if you
please, for an education. We came to Da-
vidson not for technical training but for a
cultural education—whether we have yet
realized it or not. Having now completed
our allotted time in these academic cloisters,

we should look back to see just what ®é

#have gained from our four years here.

Four years have seen us roll out of bed
six mornings out of seven for 8:25 classes,
and sleep, till hoon on the seventh; four
years Ive seen us linger till midnight while
we have studied, loafed, gone to the movies,

and run off on “wild hair” excursions. We
have gone to classes where we have slept
from the roll call till the last bell, where
we have sat thinking about a girl, where
we have taken notes mechanically, where
we may have been fired with enthusiasm by
We

faithfully—when we could not find a way

some new inspiration. have worked
out. We have gone to football games, to
basketball games, to baseball games, or we
may have tried to play golf or tennis or

intramural games. We have gone to dances,

-to house parties, to dates. We have talked

politics, philosophy, business, And we have
slept some, now that we have learned -to
sleep anywhere and everywhere—even on

a hard bed or three in a bed.

We have spent four years here, and we
have done all these and more. Now add up
all of them, What does it mean? Have we
gained anything, or have we wasted four
years and several thousands of dollars that
our parents might have used better? We
may -have learned a little chemistry, sev-
eral laws in physics, the binomial theorem,
a list of dates from a history book, the
elements of common law, the principles
of economics, or syntax in Greek. We may
have learned how to dance without tortur-
ing our partners, to play an acceptable game
of golf or tennis, to know the difference
between a line plunge and an end run on
the grid-iron. So what? Doubtless we shall
forget all this, or we shall réach the point
when we will no longer care whether we

ever knew these things at all.

What have we gained from our college
days? Was it an education, a cultural edu-
cation? We can hardly say now, for only
time will tell. Perhaps we have learned to
appreciate people and to appreciate our-

selves—virtues and weaknesses together.

Perhaps we have developed worthwhile
habits that’ will make better men of us.
Perhaps we have acquired a taste for lit-
erature, for art, or for science that will
become our destinies. If we have done any
of these, then we may not have wasted
our time and we have gotten a part of

our education.

Sut our education is far from being com-
plete. Not until the lids are fastened on
our coffins over us can our education be
complete. We must continue to learn, for
graduation | is

really a “commencement”

and we have a long road to travel.

We will receive diplomas next |month,
pieces of sheepskin which really mean lit-
tle or nothing usually. After all, Davidson
has not prepared us for any business, trade,
or profession. If our diplomas will ever
mean anything, we hope it will be that we
have learned to learn.

_ 1-MINUTE SAFETY TALKS

By Don Herold

in 1936

We can read that 36,800 people
have been killed by an earthquake in
Japan, and it doesn't make as much
of an impression on us as mashing our
own finger in a screen door.

We read that 36,800 people were
killed, and 967,840 injured in auto-
mobile accidents last year, and it
isn't so very impressive or depressive,
because they are fairly well scattered
and remote. Just a’lot of people we
don’t care about.

There is nothing much in such
figures to stir us emotionally to fear
or caution or to a resolution to drive
with exceeding care, ourselves.

Nature, darn her, blesses and curses
us with a feeling that WE are going
to be exceptions. It takes an unusu-
ally intelligent man to read statistics
and say: “I'm just as liable to trouble
as one of these 967,840. I'd better
watch out, or I'll be a statistic, my-
self, some day.”

I mean to make you cringe. I mean
to make you hurt a little when you
read these automobile accident figures,

Don’t Be A Statistic

Company. I mean to make you
subject yourself momentarily to the
painful process of imagining one of
those 36,800 or 967,840 to be your
own child,

Then multiply that wave of anguish
by 36,800 or 967,840. Every one of
those bleak human units was a precious
bit of life to someone. at a major
national calamity our automobile toll
is when we consider it in this light!

Why try to get home a half hour
sooner on Sunday night, why attempt
to add 25 miles to your day's trip,
why fo 70 or 60 miles an hour, just for
the fun of it, when you should be
doing 50 or 40—when the gamble is
with life as precious as the life of that
youngster in your own back seat or
that somebody else's youngster chas-
ing a rubber ball into the street, or
even the life of a fairly cheapadult? __
When you read these accident
statistics, remember you are not
reading of toothpicks or matches;
you're peak of 36,800 times your

Parade of Opinion

Although the college press and

the great mass of undergraduates

are still just as engrossed in in-

ternational politics as they have
been the past month or so, many
of them are turning their thoughts
to preparations for the political
battles that will be fought on the
home ground next year. There is
little to report in the way of a
trend, but the following will give
cpinion-charters something to go
on in the way of guide-posts for
the «future:

of “

Bell” — Don Ameche, Loretta
Young, Henry Fonda, Elizabeth
Patterson, and Charles Coburn,

Bobs Watson.

For once Don Ameche drops his
master-of-ceremonies flourish with
a sincere effort at characterization,
and he proves himself worthy in
every respect in his first highly
dramatic role. He plays the role of
Bell, and although the invention of
the telephone was his most famous
action the story does not dwell
on that to the point of boredom.
His work is also concerned with
early work in teaching the deaf
mutes to hear and talk. Even his
wife—Loretta Young—was unable
to hear, and of course it was large-
ly through his love for her that
Bell turned to the invention of the
device so widely used today. There
is warm emotion and touching pa-
thos found in the love story. Of
course then there’s the money in-
terest that is omnipresent; Bell
finds success only to discover that
a big corporation is trying to take
away his rights. However, his
friends come to his aid.

Henry Fonda plays the role of
friend and helper of Bell, and he
is both amusing and pleasing. Lo-

“Almost A  Gentleman”—James
Ellison, Helen Wood, Robert Kent,
Jane Clayworth, Robert Warwick,
and Ace (the dog).

The plot of the story deals with
a mongrel dog. He is found in the
city pound, on the streets, and in
the city jail. There is a murder of
a drunken derelict, and the subse-
quent trial of his adopted master
tends to prove his mettle and he
wins the love and respect of all
concerned, The theme of the story
attempts to prove that mixed
breeds, both in animals and in
humans, rate below the pure-bred
in dependability, but it will be
overlooked in favor of the greater
appearance of the love of the dog
for his master. It is just as well.
The story is too weak to carry
that heavier theme.

SNOOPINGS

Only once does the chance come to

In closing out the year, I cannot
help but throw in my two cents
worth by speaking of a change
which I believe would be beneficial
to the spirit of Davidson. The
change I advocate is a more lib-
eral paper without faculty censor-
ship of controversial articles. Since
the Davidsonian is the only medium
students have for airing their views,
they should be given free rein to
do so as long as these ideas do
not conflict with the  College’s
standards of religion and morality.
Freedom of expression, even bf ve-
hement outbursts is the safety
valve of democracy; ideas so ex-
pressed do not cause half the trou-
ble they do when kept smoldering
in the breast because of suppres-
sion. No one is perfect; why, there-
fore, should we not invite and ap-
preciate criticisms when even the
most destructive usually contain
constructive gems which tan be
assimulated and used to draw a
step nearer perfection. I firmly
believe a better Davidson would
result if the facilities of the Da-
vidsonian were open'to the students
at all times for expression of any
earnest belief.

Earl Mellen, the genial maestro
of last week-end has certainly es-
tablished some kind of a record at
Davidson. Three times he has play-
ed here for dances and each time
that set has been the best or close
to the best dance week-end of the
year. Of course no little credit must
be given to the added incentatives
of the Military Ball and the galaxy

of decorous damsels from far and
near who graced the festivities.
Realizing that a large number of
the pulchratudinous creatures did
not come within our gaze, this cor-
ner names as its ne plus ultra
nominees of the week-end Colum-
bia’s Gail Johnson, Spartanburg’s
Peggy Cleveland, and the cutie trio
from Raleigh—Evelyn Bagby,
Deede Yhurman, and Sarah Oliver.

This list omits the incomparable
young lady of the dances, Tommy
Johnston’s  F.F.V.V., who wowed
‘em right and left. We wonder if
Chick Smith really did go to bed
as early Saturday night as he so
stoutly claims.

Flash! Horace Lutz, the most fa-
mous two-year alumnus of David-
son returned to the scene of his
greatest triumphs last week-end.
All upper classmen surely remem-
ber Horace’s apologetic entrance
unheralded into the meditation
chamber where affairs of vital im-
portance were transpiring. Horace
was also the most noteworthy
initiate of the Alligator Club at in-
termission time. And this reminds
us of a tale about another KA last
week, one Jimmy Houston, which
can be told very quickly. Boy
meets girl; boy and girl become
close friends; boy comes to sorrow.

QUICKIES ON THE CUT-UPS:
Jack Abels and date both making
plausable remarks but giving food
for thought when taken together
... J. B. Lee selected out of all
the available stags to gigolo by the
distinctive Amazon of the te
dance Parker Conner just
crazy about beach week-ends with
fuzzy little high school girls .. .
Bob Wyatt quite embarassed at be-
ing told about the section of Char-
lotte he drove through on short-
cut to dances ... Paul Cooper set-
ting late owl records and bereft of
his lodge pin... (This is not for
publication so remember it wasn’t
told to you, you only heard.) Ad
Long being congratulated several
times on his engagement; wonder
what “My wife Eleanor” thinks of
this.

In closing, I hope you have en-
joyed reading between the lines
this year one tenth as much as I
have enjoyed writing the lines. To
my successor I want to hand on
this motto: Dirt is the reward of
HuperupHlousiress,

Remember?

Let’s reminisce. Let's just go over
the past year in a cursory manner,
bringing out the highlights of an
eventful happy,
and wonderful. Let’s start with the

year, depressing,

Freshmen; although that is a sorry
place to begin anything .. . fresh-
men, the mighty class of ’42. Re-
member how you looked at their
scurrilous lot and remarked, “They
get worse every year.” But now,
they aren't such a bad bunch after
all. Maybe they didn’t carry your
laundry when called; maybe they
forgot to wear their rat caps; why,
maybe they even painted the water
tank, but didn’t you? Rush
Weck, which makes the frosh
think they are the most important
people on earth only to find the
let down after the first several
weeks, 125 of them, too.

Then came the Citadel game in
Charleston which we won in a
decided victory ... hopes went up
for the Wildcats with Dick Tay-
lor leading the cheers ... Dr. John
A. Redhead was engaged to, hold
the annual Fall Vespers and did
a mighty fine job of it ... Dick
Jones and his Collegians didn’t go
over so well at the first set, of
dances . . . remember Homecom-
ing? Your best girl was down, and
all the fraternities went into ac-
tion for the dress parade which the
Pikas won, and so, did VMI with
Paul Shu and Andy Trealak veh

sour faces on both sides.
