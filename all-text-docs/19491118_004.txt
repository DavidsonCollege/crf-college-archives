“wattered down,’’ the
officials didn’t give the
Hurrieane points due
to faulty decisions —
only the truth remained

that three Davidson fumbles were recovered by Furman and} ‘

or all three of these breaks, the South Carolinians cashed in
for TD's.

True, fumbles cost us the game and added another David-
son loss to the statisties, but the thing that was most encouraging
was that, even in losing, the Red and Black didn’t look like
the same team that has been drubbed for the past month by
mountain-like seores. Tackling was still off, but the blocking
perked up. The Cat line repeatedly trapped the opposing for-
wards and opened up big holes for Runyan—in fact, it was
reminiseent of the State game. The line gave the pitcher Lambeth
more time on his heaves than he has had, although his protec-
tion was. by no means as good as it should have been. As if a
hard, charging line wasn’t enough trouble. for the Cat aerial
specialist, he worked under the added difficulty of trying to
spot his receivers amid the complex pass defense that Furman
uses, (Statistics show that it has been one of the most impreg-
nuble in the country.)

Davidson came out of the game in pretty fair shape physieal-
ly—the only casualty was Jim Sifford. Sifford broke his nose
for the second time this year and may be laid up for the Rollins
game tomorrow. Eborn and Kiser were shaken up during the
game, but not. badly enough to put thenr out,of action for any
length of time. Play during the game was fierce and fights al-
most flared up several times, but nevertheless, both teams played
the game with a minimum of injuries.

OFFENSE, DEFENSE IMPROVED

Lambeth’s passing was the best it has been since he was
slowed up by injuries. He completed 10 out of 26, and his aver-
age would have been much better had he not tried a number
of desperation passes during the waning moments of the game. |
Jim Sifford’s punting was brilliant, averaging 40 yards per try. |
‘This Compared favorably with the kicking of Paul Stombaugh,
Furman’s booting specialist, who ranks second in the country
with a 44-plus average. Erwin and Sifford both got off several
nice end runs, along with Lambeth who nearly broke away sev-

Host Maryland’s all conquering
cross country squad added another
victory to their record in the South-
ern Conference cross country run
held Monday at College Park,
while Davidson's haughty Wildcats
came in for a close fourth right be-
hind N. C. State’s Wolfpack and
North Carolina’s Tarheels. ‘The
final tabulation showed Maryland
with 32 points, State with 80,
UNC with 85, Davidson’ with 92,
and William and Mary, Duke, VPI,
and Wake Forest trailing in that
order.

The Old’ Liners led by the sen-
sational Bob Palmer,.who set a
new conference record in taking
his third straight conference vie-
tory, again dominated the meet and
swept first place without | any
trouble, but the next three teams
put on ‘a dog-fight all the way for
second, third and ‘fourth places.

Despite the fact that Blake Brad-
ley and Tom ‘Stockton of Davidson
beat the entire State team across
the. finish line, the State squad
together and
ended up just ahead of Carolina,

which was lead by Magill and Ham-
rick, Magill finished third and Ham-
rick finished seventh to offset the
poor showing made by the rest of
the team. “

In leading the Wildcats to fourth
place, Bradley and Stockton finished
eighth and ninth, only four pe:
apart. Dave Anderson was t t
Presbyterian in, finishing 20th,
while Dick Stockton was 24th and
Rob Long was 3lst to round out
the squad.

Coach Pete Whittle lauded the
team as a, whole and Bradley and
Stockton individually for their per-
formances, which ‘far exceeded his
expectations. He said the team was
looking forward to another crack
at State and Carolina in the State
meet to be run this week, and
seemed to think a victory for the
Cats entirely possible. With such
continued improvements in their
showings, the Red and Black Har-
riers could easily win this meet and
reverse their earlier loss:to State, in

addition to bringing home a State

championship.

Furman University finally did it!

Since nineteen forty — three,
the Purple Hurricanes had not been
able to win from the Davidsonians,
but last Saturday afternoon, fum-
bles told the tale of defeat, as Fur-
man won on their home fields, 21-6.
It was the fifth consecutive loss
for the Wildcats, but there was
vast improvement ‘in their play.
Furman; while never sustaining
a gdalward march, capitalized on
three’ costly Wildcat fymbles to
score in the first and third periods

of play. Furman left end Earnest

Neal took a ll-yard pass in the
end zone for six points soon after
the game opened for Furman’s first
score, The rest: of the first half
was. fought on even terms, with the
Wildcats making a 76-yard march

‘to the Furman 17, only to be thrown

back just before the half ended.
The kickoff beginning the. second
haif proved -to be the fatal blow
for the Davidsonians, as a Wild-
cat fumble was recovered on the
Davidson 24-yard line and converted
into a Furman touchdown several
plays later with Sonny Horton driv-
ing over from the two. In the same

Sports Quiz

Starting with this issue and con-
tinuing through the year, the. Da-
vidsonian will present a sports
sponsored by Chesterfield

Tars. With every fleeting week- .
end, October 8, the date of THE

win over N. C. State is slipping

further and further back along the

memory trail. Davidson is getting

weak from lack of wins and must

find the spark tomorrow night, if
they hope to be up-and ready for
the Thanksgiving finale in Char-
lotte next Thursday.

In Rollins, Davidson will face a
club, to“swy the least, different
from ‘any outfit they’ve run into
this fall. Coached by Jack Mac-
Dowell, former N. C. State star,
and Joe Justice, brother of the
Choo, Choo, the Tars run from
the double ‘or triple wing. The ©
triple wing is very much like the
double wing, the fullback lining up
close behind the line, almost in a
straight line with the two wing-
backs. That leaves the tailback
along back.

Last fall Rollins had a 3-5-1
record just as did the Wildcats,
and this week-end. they’re going to
be celebrating homecoming, the
fifth the Cats have run into. this
season. The Tars’ attack is led by
spinner,. back, or fullback, Ken
Horton, a relatively light worker
at 170, but fast. and efficient. On
the wings they have Seet Justice,

kept Davidson in the ball game during the first half before Fyn
man’s pass defense could be solved.

The all-round defensive play of the team looked better last
Saturday. Buddy Chandler continued his bruising play and Carl
Kborn finally fourid himself—turned in probably his best per-
formance this year. Acker and Wilsonhad a good afternoon
backing up the line, repeatedly stopping up holes that, the Ptir-
ples opened. From a spectators’ viewpoint, Dickie Blanks played
a brilliant game defensively, breaking through several times
‘or teeth-jarring tackles. Hoopy Davis drew a starting assign-
ment and filled the bill like a veteran. His spirit and fight la-
belled him as an example of what a fightin’ Wildeat ought te
look like. Sophomores Bill MeNeely and Jim Fasul deserve
mentién for their line play, These two hefties continue to show
promise of future greatness.

CATS WILL TAKE ROLLINS, CITADEL

Davidson will win their last two games this year. A com-
bination of factors have weakened them for the past five games,
but the Cats are ready for these last two. The squad gtill lacks
a lot of being what it should have been this year, but they are
capable of taking Rollins and The Citadel and what's more, they
will. If the Cats brush up on pass defense and blocking and
tackling during this next week and a half, they can’t be denied
their seeond and third wins of the year.
