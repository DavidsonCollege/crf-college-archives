Under the organization of
Dick Levan and Zack Mob-
ley, soccer and rugby clubs
are being formed this spring
for any interested Davidson
students.

“ According to (Levan, inter-
est in soccer has become so
great. that the formation of
club has been undertaken
both for students not involved
in varsity play and varsity
players who wish to work out
during the off-season.

The club hopes to field two
teams which will compete
twice a week in regulation
games, both with themselves
and amateur clubs from the
Charlotte area.

Wildcat. hurler Rick Pipan threw only 75 pitches in the VMI game.

Students Form Soccer, Rugby Clubs

Working with Levan in the
organization of the club are

Ranier ‘Langenburg and
Robin Gray.

During the weekly prac-
tices and inter-team play,
lessons will be offered for
the club members in both
the fundamentals and stra-
tegy of soccer.

Levan stressed that the
club is open to any student
and will be both recreational
and educational.

‘Basically the aims of the
club are to have a good time
and to help the players stay
in shape,”’ Levan stated.

Improved Golfers
Open At Furman

By DAVE TIERNEY
Sports Writer

With .a team ‘‘much im-
proved” according to Ath-
letic Director and Coach
Tom Scott, the ’Cats golf
team teed off its new season
yesterday at the Furman
Invitational.

_. Entered in the meet for
Sthe ’Cats were senior Doug
Clark, sophomores Rusty
Boyd, Scott Sheftall, Bill
_ Guerrant, and freshmen Dick
Spinnex_and Jim Ray.

Scott commented that team
potential is definitely im-
proved this year, and more
important, the team is
young.

He was skeptical, however
of expecting too much at
this first meet due to the
limited practices since spring
break. Snow cancelled the
first match against Rutgers
last Thursday.

Though improved, Scott
has presented the team with
avery tough schedule that
includes Duke, North Car-
olina, N.C. State, and the
Chris Schenkel Invitational
in Georgia.

. Scott also said, ‘‘I am try-
‘ing to schedule a match with
national power Wake Forest.
“I like. to ‘give the team
very challenging competi-

tion.” :

Concerning the Southern
Conference; he stated that
at this time both Furman
and East Carolina ‘‘look
better on paper than we do,”
but he expects a close battle
for the championship.

The Wildcats will be play-
ing their home matches at
the Charlotte Country Club.

interested in the game to
learn about it, and for var-
sity players to stay in
practice.”

Even though over sixty
students have already signed
up for the program, Levan
said that there has been
some friction with the ad-
ministration due to a _ pro-
posed ten per cent cut in the
soccer budget.

“We are having a hard
time getting equipment,’’ he
said, ‘‘Both the soccer and
the P.E. departments are
reluctant to let us use the
equipment we need to get
started.’

The cut in funds would also
prevents the team from tak-
ing a proposed trip next
year.

At present all the finances
for the club come from in-
dividual donations.

“Though ‘‘quite shocked
and .upset’’, Levan said the

‘efforts of the club would not

be stymied.

He mentioned that several
films of international games
had been ordered and will
be shown for instructional
purposes during this term.

‘Cats Take Pair,
Entertain Spiders

The Wildcat baseball team
meets the Spiders from the
University of Richmond here
tomorrow afternoon in a dou-
bleheader.

Tuesday the ‘Cats were de-
feated by the Cavaliers of
the University of Virginia 7-3,
but they bounced back to
polish off the Keydets of
VMI 1 and 3-0 in a double-
header on Wednesday.

Coach Tom Stevens .has
been pleased with the per-
formance of «this year's
squad, particularly the pitch-
ing.

In the first-of the games
against VMI, fick fPipan
threw a total of 75 pitches,
or roughly 10 an inning. Pi-
pan is presently 3-0 with an
E.R.A. of 0.56.

Davidson also has plans to
field a rugby club.

The. club is holding prac-
tices twice a week, and Mo-
bley is working to arrange
a schedule of games. with
other schools in the area.

The rugby club has been
operating for three years
since Mobley organized it as
a freshman, but played only
one match last fall.- Mobley
indicated that he intends to
have a much fuller schedule
for the spring season.

Both the soccer and rugby
clubs are open to any David-
son students.

Any interested persons
should contact either Levan
or Mobley or check the an-
nouncement posted in the
Union and Chambers.

. According to Stevens the
greatest problem’: presently
facing the team is their ina-
bility to get clutch hits.
\Leading the team in hitting
are ‘Harold Wilkerson and’
Bill Barnhill, batting .380
and .390 respectively.
Stevens is also impressed
with shortstop Jack Willits,

.who was out with an injury

most of last season. In the
first VMI game, Willits drove
in the only run with a sev-
enth inning double.

Weather conditions have
hurt the team during the last
weeks, causing a reschedul-
ing of several games and a
loss of practice time.

* Next week, the ’Cats open |
a string of home games, kick-
ing off with the University of
North Carolina-Chapel Hill.

‘ The UNC game will be par-
ticularly challenging: to Ste-
weng because he will be play-
ing against his former col-
lege coach.
