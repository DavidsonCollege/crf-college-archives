LOVE LETTERS

Davidson couple performs A. R. Gurney play

By JAMES BERRY
Staff Writer

Walking in the 900 Room last
Saturday night would have pre-
sented you with quite a different
scene from the usual 21-year-old
chatter or even the focused silence
of the movies that we’re all used
to. In fact, I might go so far to say
that the arrangement was just shy
of elegant. A long table loaded
with desserts stretched along one
wall, while the tables, available for
parties of two or four, invited a
pinch of awe with their long, drap-
ing tablecloths and atmosphere-
inducing candles. The scene was
catered by Commons—why
doesn’t Commons ever looks so
suave?

The event to inspire so much
work was the Davidson Commu-
nity Players’ dinner theater pro-
duction of “Love Letters” by A.R.
Gurney. Only two actors took the
small stage that night—Dr. Donald
Kimmel and Meg Kimmel. The
Synopsis on the program begins
“Set in the world of contemporary
New England, Love Letters traces
the lives of Andrew Ladd and
Melissa Gardner over the span of
fifty years,” and in just two hours
the two had played out quite a
story.

Before the show started, audi-
ence members lined up for their
promised desserts. Here’s an an-

- notated list of the menu: pecan

tarts, brownie cake (a.k.a. “Death
by Chocolate,”) two filled past-
ries, blackberry cobbler, carrot
cake, cheese cake, strawberry
shortcake, and, to top it all off,
fresh brewed coffee. —

The stage held only a few set
pieces. Divided by a small plant,
the setup represented Andrew and
Melissa’s respective homes.
Andy’s side contained a simple
wooden desk and a small painting
of a hunting party on the wall.
Melissa, the daughter of wealthy
parents (and an artist to boot,) was

furnished with a large, abstract
painting, a comfortable chair, and
a small end table.

The play’s action was almost
entirely static with neither actor
moving from his/her seat, but the
dialogue was enough to keep the
story moving. The whole play
revolves around the correspon-
dence between Andrew and Mel-
issa via letters. Though the two
meet throughout the fifty year span,
the meetings are never acted out on
stage but are discussed through the
letters.

Rather than a dialogue of
straight speech, the two communi-
cate (to each other and to the audi-
ence) by reading their letters aloud
and reacting to what is being read.
Even silence was well used as a
refusal to answer some disturbing
correspondence.

The relationship between the
characters starts early in elemen-
tary school with a ridiculous ex-
change of valentines. We hear
about Andy’s adventure into the
girls’ bathroom and Melissa’s pic-

ture of Andy and herself without .

their bathing suits on (“Guess
which one you are.”).

In high school we learn about
the timid sexual exploration be-
tween the two and with others,
including the jealousy that ensues.
Andy tells of his experience as a
camp counselor and Melissa tries
to explain her twisted family life.
At intermission, the actors ex-

changed their youthful clothes for -

more mature outfits. The second
half follows Andrew’s rise to the
senate and Melissa’s study of art,
their wild affair, and finally
Melissa’s death.

The whole evening was out-
standing in every respect and cér-
tainly worth the five dollar en-

. trance fee.

Hopefully, we’ll have the op-
portunity to see something like this
again, deserts and all. Keep your
eye on the “On the Scene” box in
the Arts section of the Davidsonian.
