Five Teams Selected by New Plan Will
Meet Leading Institutions on Two Trips Contest With Davidson

For the collegiate year of 1927-28, the
Davidson debating team has five of list
year’s men back: Tyree Dillard, Leo Prit-
chett, Henry Powell, Bob Grady, and W.
K. Pritchett.

The coming ‘try-outs for this season’s
debating squad will be held on December
2nd. They wiil be in the manner of a
five minute talk on the subject: Resolved,
that uniform system of marriage and di-
vorce laws shou'd be enacted by nation-
al legis'ation. By this system all but ten

of the thirty men, who have signified! November 2sth.

their intention of trying out for the
team, they should see Henry Powell not
later than Thanksgiving.

The squad is to be made up of five
teams, each to be composed of two men.
One of these teams will be se'ected to de-
fend Davidson's title in Shearer Hall
against Rutgers College, April 2, and al-
so William and Mary and the University
of Florida, some time during the months
of March and April. Another team will
be selected to make a trip south and meet
the University of Florida at Gainesville,
on March 13 ,also Emory University on
March 16, and Sewanee on March 15,

At the same time the tenm leaves for
the southern trip, another will leave for
the north, and will meet Hampden-Sid-
ney on March 13, George Washington
University on March 14, and the Univer-
sitv of Pittsburgh on the following day.

The subject, which both of the teams
making the trips are to us, will be: “Re-
solved, that the United States should
cease to protect, by force of arms, the
capital invested in foreign lands except
after formal declaration of war.”

D. C. GLEE CLUB QUARTET
CHOSEN

The quartet of the Davidson College
Glee Club which has recently been select-
ed, is composed of J. S. Foster, Winston-
Salem, baritone; J. S. Grey, Jr., Rich-
mond, Va., first tenor; R. S. Lowrance,
Atlantag,Ga., second tenor; and Procter
Thompson, Davidson, bass. The entire
club is practicing regularly for the state
meet in Durham, the club being in charge
of Prof. Ernest J. Cullum, musical di-
rector of the college.

We hesitate'to make any predictions on the
outcome of today’s game on Richardson
Field. The Tar Heels proved last week that
the Duke team was not above defeat even
more strongly than the State Collegé team
proved it. The Blue Devils, however, will be
determined to make a showing today. The
Wildcats licked them last year, and. the two
recent defeats which they have suffered this
year will make them feel all the more |
“devilish.”

Dr. Tigert Speaks
Before Collegians

Dr. John J. Tigert, United States Com-
missioner of Education, will be a speaker
before the Interfraternity Conference,

when the organization of American col-

fege fraternities begins its annual two- |

day session at the Hotel Pennsylvania on

the meeting of more than 200 college

country, on American educational prob-
lems.

A feature of the first day’s ‘session will
be a luncheon at which Dr. Francis W.

Shepardson, vice-president of Phi Beta
Kappa and former commissioner of edu-
cation in Illinois, will be toastmaster.
Judge William R. Bayes, chairman of
|the Interfraternity Conference, will be
a. speaker.

| The Interfraternity Conference, estab-
|lished in 1909 at Chicago as the result
of activity on the part of President Wm.
H. P. Faunce, of Brown, is the result of a
realization on the part of college fra-
ternities of their common ideals and aims.
Through the efforts of the conference,
mutual jealousies and rivalries have di-
minished and a clearer conception grown
up of the modern fraternity as an ad-
junct to self-government at American
colleges and _ universities. Hamilton
Wright Mabie was the first chairman of
| the conference.

|

The conference has grown until today
it includes practically all-the long-estab-
lished fraternities in addition to many of
the newer ones.

Dr. Tigert will address |

fraternity delegates from all parts of the |

Statesville Riflemen

| Trophies Will be Award-d H‘gh-
| Point Men at End of Scason

The Davidson College rif?e team is pro-
gressing steadily in its match with States-
ville. This match is being fired every
Tuesday night during the month of No-
vember, and the winner will be deter-
!mined by the highest number of points
made by any man on any one night of
‘firing, Several members of the States-
ville team are men who might be termed
jas “crack shots” since they have com-
|} peted in the national rifle match, and are
considered the best shots in this part of
ithe country.
|

On the fifth of December, an innova-
{tion in rifle marksmanship at Davidson
thas been planned. An open match, spon-
tsored by the Davidson rifle team, and
}open to-every man in the student body,
|will be held. ©The student scoring the
{greatest number of points will be pro-
claimed the winner, and will be pre-
sented with a handsome’ shield given by
the rifle team, This shield is made of
silver on a mahogany background and
has inscribed on it “Davidson Open
Match.” Qn the top there are crossed
rifles. The student winning this trophy
is allowed to keep it for one year, after
which time it will be competed for again
in the same way.

‘After Christmas, the Scabbard and
Blade will hold a match which is open
to all men taking R. O. T. T. This match
is to be called the Scabbard and Blade
trophy match and the winner will be pre-
sented with a gold medal on which are
crossed rifles and a bull’s eye. The win-
ner is to be decided in the same way as
in the other matches.

Three trips have been planned for the

rifle team in the spring. These will be to
Gastonia, Oak Ridge, and V. M. I. On

iValucd Prizes Are
| Offered Freshmen

in Essay Contest

A contest for university and college is
to be held again this year. This contest,
with prizes totalling $6,000, is being con-
ducted by the American Chemical Society
during the 1927-28 season, essays being
submitted not later than March 1.

In order that those students who are
just beginning their college work may
have a more intimate knowledge of chem-
istry, and that they may realize the rela-
tion between the sciences and the activ-
ities of our present civilization. The
American Chemical Society has establish-
ed an assay contest for the college first
year men, This contest which was made
possible by Mr. and Mrs, Francis P. Ga-
van, of New York, was conductéd last
year upon the same basis and was ex-
ceedingly pouular, many thousands of
essays being written on the subjects pro-
posed by the contest committee.

The same questions which were used
last year will again make the Freshmen
“sit up and take notice” as well as sit
down and write. These questions which
are based on practical and useful knowl-
edge do not require a great amount of
technical learning as will be seen in the
list of the questions for the year which
are printed below:

1, The relation of Chemistry to the En-
richment of Life.

‘2. The relation of’ Chemistry to Ag-
riculture and Forestry.

and Disease.

tional Defense.

Home.

these trips the members of the .team who
have made the highest scores will be

3. The relation of Chemistry to Health |

6. The relation of Chemistry to the De-
velopment of an Industry on a Resource
of the United States.

Last year six prizes of $1,000 were
awarded but the society decided that it
would be more practical and would arouse
greater interest in offering the prizes. this
year to divide the same amount of prize
money into eighteen different prizes, six
each of $500, $300 and $200. Information
in the form of pamphlets have been re-
ceived by. the professors here and they
are anxious that as many Freshmen as
possible will enter. The reference books
are suggested by the society as bearing on
one of these subjects will be found either
in the Chemical or Union Library. y

some Carolina school has ample opportunity
to take the first prize again.

The contestants are limited ta twelve hun-
dred words in their oration, and only two
hundred of these may be quoted words. Any
subject may be used for the speech. Last
year Davidson failed to send a representative
to the contest and no applicants have as yet
appeared for the preliminary try-outs. Any-
one wishing to work to this end, or even to
inquire further into the matter, should see
Henry Powell at some time during the next
few days. A definite date has not yet been
set for the Davidson try-outs and they will
probably not be held until after Christmas,
but work is beginning on them at once.
