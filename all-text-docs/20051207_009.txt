Townies: A conversation with Davidson hatmaker Viadimir Radovitchsky

Townies is a new Yowl series featur-

ing weekly interviews with Davidson
business owners and other local per-
sonalities

Interviewer: Bill Denison ‘07
Interviewed: Vladimir Radovitchsky

The Yowt: Mr. Radovitchsky, let me first
thank you so much for speaking to us today.

Vladimir Radovitchsky: It is my great
pleasure to speak to the students of
Davidson College. ,

TY: Maybe you could
start by telling us a little
bit about yourself?

VR: Of course. Iam
Russian hatmaker, and I
have small hat stand on
Main Street called ‘Hats,
Hats, Hats.’ I have lived
here in Davidson for
about three years only,
but I am enjoying it very
much so.

TY:. What made you
decide to move to
America all the way from
Russia?

VR: Things were not
going so good for me in
Russia. Icome from a
poor family, and I have
always -dreamed of
America as the land of opportunity.

Also, a lot of people tell me I look kind of
like popular American actor Burt Reynolds.
So, I figured I would fit in here.

TY: What has been your impression of
Davidson so far, both the town and the col-
lege?

“All four!”

Hat Ears Up!

VR: Davidson is wonderful place. The
best part is fashion. In Russia, we don’t so
much have your types of clothes. Jeans and
sweaters I very much like, but they are diffi-
cult to come by in my country.

We usually just cut open a fresh bear
every winter and create a coccoon out of it
until the summer weeks begin iri June. In
July, we must kill new bear or else freeze to
death very much. Now I have many jeans
and sweaters, and my own hat stand,
stocked with over four hats.

TY: What has been the most difficult part
about adapting to a new country and new
culture?

VR: It was difficult for me at first to figure
out what clothing
size I was, because
we go by different
system in Russia.
You see, in bear, I
am a size Siberian
Grizzly long. But
American clothing
sizes do not run in
bear. That was a
tough transition to
make.

TY: So how did
you decide that you
wanted to operate a
hat stand? Was that
your job in Russia?

VR: No, in
Russia, I was part-

time gravedigger

and insurance
salesman. When I first arrived in America at
a port in Lake Norman, I did not know a sin-
gle person. To tell the truth, I was living on
the street, without even a place to call home
or a bear to keep me warm.

I would poach local squirrels for food, and
use their skins for clothes. Finally, I said to

myself, ‘Vladimir, you must get job! Pull
yourself together!’ Then I thought, if you
create stand to sell squirrel skins, you are no
longer a man on the street. You are a man
with a squirrel stand. On the street.

TY: So you started making hats out of
squirrels. Ingenius. How many squirrels
does it
take to
make a
hat?

VR: No,
I began by
selling
just the
squirrel
skins. I realized soon this business was
doomed. No one wants to buy just skins. So
I glued all the skins together, and when I
looked at it I said, ‘You look like hat!’ To
answer your question, I believe it takes
about 1,000 squirrels to make one hat.

TY: One thousand squirrels to make just
one hat?

VR: Oh, excuse me (laughs). That is met-
ric system. In American numbers, I would
say it takes about eight or nine squirrels to
make hat.

TY: So what kind of styles do your hats
come in? Do you have different colors or
perhaps casual hats versus dress hats for
formal attire?

VR: The hats pretty much just come in
the one color and style, you know, squirrel.
But my hats come in two sizes: Hat Ears Up
and Hat Ears Down. When Hat Ears Up,
brr... it is so cold. But When Hat Ears Down,
warm!

TY: Do you have any study tips for the
students at Davidson College during our
exam period?

VR: Make sure to reward yourself. When
I am working hard making hats from squir-
rel, I say “One squirrel, one shot of vodka.”

“My hats come in two
sizes: Hat Ears Up and
Hat Ears Down.”

Vodka makes you enjoy the work, because
you know that the more you do, the more
vodka you get for drink.

One time, I work so hard that I made a hat
Hat Ears Down when I meant to make the
hat Hat Ears Up! That is same day that
Vladimir had to pay fine for public urina-
tion.

TY: Well, Mr. Radovitchsky, let
me say on behalf of the staff of the
Yowl and the Davidsonian, thank
you so much for this wonderful
interview.

VR: It is nothing. Davidson stu-
dents, come to Hats, Hats, Hats
for 15% off all squirrel hats and
free vodka shot with use of your school’s Cat
Card!

Hats, Hats, Hats is usually located out-
side of the Exxon station, unless the
Davidson Town Police have asked Mr.
Radovitchsky to move on that day.
Vladomir says to just look for the guy wear-
ing a squirrel hat, jeans, and a sweater.

Hat Ears Down!

Davidson community the losers in
Christmas light competition

On Friday night around 10 p.m., the town
of Davidson experienced a blackout lasting
some three hours due to the drain in power
caused by the Christmas lights on Patterson
Court. While the college’s backup generators
kicked in shortly after the blackout, giving
ail campus buildings electricity until power
was brought back, the town was left without
any electricity until after 1 a.m.

The blackout occurred while 4 number of
horse-drawn carriages from Christmas at
Davidson were taking a tour of the Patterson
Court houses’ decorations. “The lights
looked so good,” said Margaret Hunter, a
Davidson resident. “It was just such a lovely
tour on the carriage until the lights went out
suddenly. The experience
turned from magical to

Rusk President Josie Garrison ’06
expressed her relief when she found out SAE
would be held responsible. “I was worried
that we had caused the whole thing, and that
we'd get all the restrictions slapped on us.
We had just plugged in an electric wreath
that night, so we weren’t sure if we were
going to be the ones who broke the limit.”

SAE Vice President Kevin Morley ’07 says
he plans to protest the restrictions. “We did-
n’t go crazy like some houses and put lights
up on every inch of our roof and nearby
trees. We just wanted to have a few lights
around the door so we could see the people
in the carriages that we were yelling at.

“That’s not something we should be held

responsible for. I mean,

miserable pretty quickly
when we _ realized that
we were all sitting in the
dark next to a frat house
smelling horse manure.”
Patterson Court
Council representative
John Richards ’06 said,
“Every year, right after
Thanksgiving, we tell the
plant to have a few backups on hand for all

‘the lights that Sigma Phi Epsilon puts up, so

they were prepared for that. This year,
though, so many lights went up around the
Court — unexpectedly — and we could not
warn the manager of the power plant in
time. The results were regrettable, but we’re
happy to report that there haven’t been any
problems since Friday.”

Inquiries into the specifics of Friday night
have determined that the electricity con-
sumption on the Court was within tolerance
until Sigma Alpha Epsilon plugged in three
strings of outdoor lights to string up around
the door. Richards has stated that the frater-
nity will be placed on probation for their
actions and that the Council has yet to deter-
mine further restrictions. Of course, they
have been declared ineligible in the campus
decorations contest as well.

“The experience
turned from magi-
Cal to miserable

pretty quickly.”

they should get on some
of these houses that have
polar bears and reindeer
and elves and stuff in
their yards; they’re the
real cause of the power
problems, not us.”

Patterson Court regu-
lations, however, stipu-
late a clear “first come,
first serve” policy on
resources like electricity and water. By regu-
lation, therefore, the last house to plug in
something when a power outage occurs is
considered responsible for causing that out-
age.

Damage caused by accidents and losses
during the power outage total $9000, which
the college has agreed to pay by using the
excess money from the Activities Tax
Council. Town council spokeswoman
Harriett Woodall, however, suggests that
reimbursement is insufficient. “The college
interferes with town life all the time, and we
tolerate it. But this latest incursion of college
life on the livelihoods of town residents is
just too much. It’s about time the students
do some service around here and give back
to the community.” Woodall intends to pres-
ent her argument to the Board of Trustees in
March.
