Opening April 25

Elaborate Shakespearian Production To Appear

By ANNE LAMBERT

When the curtain opens on the
Davidson College Theater De-
partment’s spring production of
William Shakespeare’s The Tem-
pest April 25th in Hodson Hall the
audience will view the results of
over 90 hours of rehearsal time
and 60 hours of work on set design
and construction, 30 costume
changes, $500 worth of muslin
and canvas, and the combined ef-
forts of more than 100 people.
Those involved include a cast of
25, and a tech crew of 60-plus, all
under the direction of Dr. Rupert
Barber. No tempest in a teapot,
this.

Written in 1611, The Tempest
is one of Shakespeare’s most
theatrical romances, full of magi-
cal illusion, romance and intrigue.
The play opens on the deck of a
ship in the midst of a violent
storm, which Prospero has com-
manded his sprite Ariel to create
by magic, in order to bring its pas-
sengers to his island. (Twelve
years before, Prospero’s brother
Antonio usurped his authority and
his title and exiled the rightful
duke fo an island with his daugh-
ter, Miranda.) This ship’s passen-
gers include Antonio, the usurp-
ing Duke, Alonso, the King of
Naples, Sebastian, the King’s
brother, the King’s son Fer-
dinand, Gonzalo, his counselor,
and various attendants.

All land safely on the island,
but Prospero has contrived that the
young handsome prince Fer-
dinand be seperated from the royal
party. Supposing the rest of his
group lost at sea, Ferdinand sadly
assumes himself now King of
Naples. He and Miranda fall in
love, a match approved by Pros-
pero. On the other side of the is-
land, the King and his group are
amazed by their magical sur-
roundings. While he is sleeping,
Sebastian and Antonio plot to-
gether to kill the King, and place
Sebastian in power, but Ariel
awakens Alonso before they can
carry out the deed. Meanwhile,
two other passengers on the ship,
Trinculo and Stephano, jesters to
the court, have also landed on the

island. They meet up with the
wretched, deformed monster
Caliban, a slave to Prospero, who,
out of hatred for his master, con-
spires with the jesters against him.
(Prospero, however, is aware of
the plot and is not threatened by
it.)

Prospero, employing his
magic powers, continues to con-
trol the events on the island. He
conjures up a banquet before the
king’s party causing them amaze-
ment and confusion. He summons
the goddesses Iris, Ceres, and
Juno to bless the marriage of Fer-
dinand and Miranda, and thwarts
the conspiracy of Caliban and the
jesters by chasing them away with
conjured spirits.

At last, Prospero instructs
Ariel to bring the king’s group be-
fore him. He forgives his brother,
reunites Ferdinand with his father,
restores the wrecked ship, rebukes
a remorseful Caliban, frees Ariel,
and reclaims his Dukedom, ar-
ranging to return to Milan with the
King and his company.

The Tempest contains many
themes dealing with the nature of
art, reality and illusion, rebellion
against authority, usurpation of
power, and freedom and ser-
vitude. The theme of art and crea-
tion of art through imagination is
central to The Tempest. Prospero
uses his magic, his imagination,
to artfully manipulate situations,
events, and people to suit his pur-
poses. Although he possesses a
powerful ability, his intensions
are always toward a positive end.
“Prospero’s magic is not black
magic,” says Dr. Barber, “even
though it may be used for [seem-
ingly] bad ends—for example, the
storm. There is still good which
results.”

Senior John Marks, who plays
Prospero, sees him as a man “‘al-
most mad from the power he pos-
sesses. Yet at other times, he’s
simply weary of his power, he
wants to give it up. I maybe a trite
interpretation, but I think it’s
valid, that the storm that Prospero
creates reflects, as some have
said, the storm inside of himself,”
the vacillation between good and

evil.

The sprite Ariel and the mons-
ter Caliban have been seen as al-
legorical embodiments of Pros-
pero’s imagination, Ariel as a
manifestation of good art and
Caliban a representation of art for
bad ends. (Some productions of
The Tempest have portrayed Cali-
ban as a representative figure for
black Americans, suffering in
slavery and rebelling unsuccess-
fully against a harsh master. )

The Tempest also treats the
themes of romantic and parental
love, themes that Dr. Barber
hopes to emphasize. “The re-
lationship between Prospero and
Miranda is a major relationship of
the play. Prospero’s concern for
his daughter can help to explain
some of his . . . illogical actions.
He is a father torn between want-
ing his daughter to stay with him
and letting her grow up, letting her
leave.” In that regard, Barber be-
lieves, the play has special rele-
vance to the college-age audience.
Barber also recognized the impor-
tance of the relationship between
Ferdinand and Miranda. “We
want to bring out the romantic as-

pect of the play—its exotic, super-
natural elements. The play is
romantic in all sorts of ways,
especially the magic of the love
relationship.”

Time and setting are essential
thematic elements of the play, as
well. The text contains numerous
references to time; indeed, the
word ‘‘now” occurs no less than
seventy-nine times during the
play. Dr. Joe Gardner has created
the island setting using a raked
platform set which extends into
the audience. The set, says Dr.
Barber, incorporates elements of
the Elizabethan stage, with the in-
tent of bringing the action closer
to the viewer.

The cast of The Tempest is
comprised of several students new
to the Davidson stage, as well as
theater veterans. John Marks ends
a long Davidson theater career
with his role as Prospero. and is
excited about the character.
“Prospero is at a point in his life
where he stands to gain everything
or lose everything. Whatever truth
he realizes on this island, he has to
leave it behind because he’s going

back to be a ruler. This is his mo-
ment of truth.”

Marks’ first role at Davidson
was as a freshman, playing Glow-
gauer in “Once in a Lifetime.” He
has since played leads in The
Suicide, Poor Murderer, and in
last fall’s production of Misal-
liance.

It’s been a unique experience
these past four years,” Marks ac-
knowledges, “because I’ve had
the opportunity to play every-
thing, from being an ornament on
stage to a lead role. I’ve worked
with two or three generations of
Davidson actors and actresses.
I've done everything,” Marks
says, everything except a musical,
because, he admits, “I can't sing.”

Freshman Maxine Curry and
junior Steve Hughes, as the lovers
Miranda and Ferdinand, are rela-
tively new to the theater. Hughes
says, “I’m surprised at how com-
fortable I feel compared to the be-
ginning. The only [previous] thea-
ter experience | had was being a
G-man in You Can't Take It With
You. Hughes had three lines in
that production, the longest being,
“There's enough gunpowder
down there to blow up the whole
city.” With the role of Ferdinand
he increases his on-stage time
considerably, and enjoys practic-
ing his favorite line: “The white
cold virgin snow upon my heart
abates the ardor of my liver.”

The Purple Rose Of Cairo: Hilarious And Moving Film

By MATT MORRIS

Cecilia (Mia Farrow) is a
young girl living in New Jersey
during the dark depression circa
1935. Silly, but enjoyable, adven-
ture/lovestory films like The Pur-
ple Rose of Cairo play the mar-
quee several times daily and divert
our heroine’s attentions from her
real world situation—an unfaith-
ful husband (Danny Aeillo) and a
horrible job as a waitress. All is
stale in Cecilia’s life until one
day, during a matinee showing of
Purple Rose, the lead actor,
suave, good-guy Tony Baxter
(Jeff Daniels) strolls off the screen
and into Cecilia’s startled arms,
proclaiming his love for her. Of

course, the other performers on
screen are a bit miffed by the de-
parture of their star, but Cecilia's
new “fictional” boyfriend
couldn’t care less and off they
stroll into the world seeking ad-
venture and romance.

One of the nicest things about
Woody Allen’s 13th movie, also
called The Purple Rose of Cairo is
that in spite of such a fantastic pre-
mise, the film comes off as credi-
ble, even moving. By the last,
heart-breaking moment, Allen has
transformed what could have been
merely a jolly comedy of errors
into a truly meaningful look at il-
lusion and reality, the roman-
‘irized vs. the truth. Cecilia loves

Tom, but he is still a child, an
E.T. who, like all movie heros,
never gets hurt in a fight and is
thus removed from the harsher
realities of the world. Cecilia
seeks escape from her drabby
world but she doesn’t completely
deny ‘reality.’ Tom, a charming
but flat character, is on a perma-
nent movie ‘trip’ that Cecilia en-
joys but quickly overdoses on.
Part of the magic of movies,
Woody Allen understands, is the
fact that they are created in a
world that is not perfect. Beauty is
only beautiful when there is
‘ugly.’ Gil (also played, but in a
completely different way, by Jeff
Daniels) the actor who portrays

Tom has the screen character's
good looks, but little of his naive
charm and kindness. Cecilia ulti-
mately falls for both Tom and
Gil—the romantic, ideal and the
real McCoy and her Purple Rose
probes into darker undercurrents
as Allen reveals the sacrifices
Cecilia must make when caught in
a world that doesn’t quite live up
to her movie expectations.

To reveal anymore of this film
wold be positively sinful—all that
need be said here is that there are
some typically hilarious Woody
Allen visual jokes and pokes at old
Hollywood—the actual movie-
within-a-movie “Purple Rose of
Cairo” has a perfectly silly old

Hollywood feel, complete with
dry martinis, playboys and Hattie
McDaniel stereotypes. Mia Far-
row does a brilliant little tramp
impersonation (under Woody she
has always been excellent) and the
entire ensemble, including Ed-
ward Herrmann, Danny Aeillo
and in a cameo, Ruth Gordon, are
all terrific. Purple Rose of Catro
may sound completely out of this
world, but the problems of failed
marriages, hopes and dreams and
above all else, the power of
movies to control us, delight us
and leave a scar in our head ts
earthbound and what The Purple
Rose of Cairo iy ultimately all
about
