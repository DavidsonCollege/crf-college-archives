Track Breaks Three School Records In ‘Tournament

By ANDY BARRON

The Davidson men’s track
team finished their season at the
Southern Conference meet in
Boone last weekend. The team
scored 18 points, and set three
school records at the meet.

The top Davidson perfor-
mance came from senior Jeff Car-
ter who won the high jump at a
height of 6’8”. Rain and a lack of
competition foiled Carter's at-
tempt at seven feet.

“It was great to finally win
after coming close for several
years,” said Carter. “The rain
made jumping tough, but I was
still pleased with my _ perfor-
mance.

Carter's efforts in the high
jump scored ten of Davidson's
points. Senior Jay Braun added
six points by placing third in the
pole vault at 14°0”. Junior Lon
Krempel tossed the discus 140’°0”
to finish sixth and add one point.
Davidson's final point came from

a sixth place finish by the 400-
meter relay team of freshmen Ben
MacKay and Robert Sickles and
seniors Braun and David Turner.
The time for the relay team was
42.78.

“I was pleased with how the
team performed at the meet and
throughout the season,” Coach
Gwen Harris said. “Jeff should be
really proud (about winning the
high jump). Also Jay set a per-
sonal best in the pole vault. The
whole team did well, but these

Hitters

Davidson's hopes for its first
Southern Conference — baseball
came to an end _ last
weekend at the SC tournament.

On Friday Davidson squared
off against Marshall, a team that
had won 21 of its last 24 games
coming into the tournament.
Junior Scott Weaver surrendered a
two run homer in the first and
single runs in the third and fourth
innings as the Cats fell behind 4-0.
Davidson closed the gap to 4-1
when sophomore David Tur-
geon’s fly scored Keith Helfant
from third. However the Cats
could do no more damage. Mar-
shall sealed the victory with two
runs in the eighth and three more
in the ninth to make the final score
9-1. The loss sent Davidson into
the loser’s bracket where every
game was win or go home.

Saturday the Cats faced host
Appalacian State. Turgeon broke
a scoreless tie in the fourth with an
RBI single, but App responded in
the fifth with a run of their own to
tie it at 1-1. In the sixth, the Cats
walked to an 8-1 lead with one
out. Turgeon doubled, then

Weaver and junior Tim Waters
drew free passes. After another
out, sophomores David Depaul,
Dan Simonds and freshman Bill
Masse all drove in runs with bases
on balls. Helfant followed with a
single, and after
freshman Alan Lewis walked,
Turgeon collected his second hit
of the inning, driving in two more.
Freshman David _ Fitzgerald
pitched into the eighth before
sophomore Steve Condon came
on to finish. ASU got a homer in
the eighth off Fitzgerald and a
single run in the ninth to make the
score 8-5.

On Sunday the Cats” lack of
pitching depth did them in. Con-
don started but was obviously stiff
after his appearance the day be-
fore. He was touched for nine runs
in the first, giving Western
Carolina a big cushion. Sopho-
more Billy Waitsman came in and
pitched well, shutting down the
Catamounts in innings two
through six. The Cats, mean-
while, could manage only one run
in the first and another in the ninth
as Western eliminated Davidson
13-2. The Cats ended up third in

two-run

the conference.

On Tuesday the Cats re-
bounded to drill Gardner-Webb
19-0 and 5-1 in a double-header.
Weaver pitched the opener and
dominated G-W. He struck out
thirteen batters in only six innings
of work, bringing his season total
to 86 K's. Ten Davidson batters
had hits including a home run by
Turgeon and a grand slam by
freshman Terry Rupp. Freshman
Roy Vilard had four RBI's and
Lewis and Helfant each collected
three.

In the nightcap freshman Dar-
ryl Bego pitched a complete
game, going into the seventh be-
fore allowing-a hit. Masse scored
three times for the Cats and stole
three bases. Helfant had three hits
and drove in two runs as the Cats
cruised to an easy victory.

Tuesday's sweep gave the
Cats 23 wins, breaking the school
record of 21. Five games remain
on the schedule. Today the Cats
take on Florida Atlantic, the
Number Four Division If team in
the nation, and May 7 and 8 they
play UNCC.

two efforts came in the rain,
which makes them that much bet-
ter.”

The other highlights — for
Davidson were the three records
set at the meet. Sophomore Greg
Foreman ran a 1:55.31 in the 800
meters to break his own school re-
cord. Senior John Ponder clocked
a 49.51 in the 400 meters to break
the old record set in 1980 by Dick
Jones. Finally, the 1600-meter
relay team of Sickles, Foreman,
freshman John Lantis, and Ponder

ran a 3:23.02 for the third record.
Though none of these perfor-
mances were good enough to
score points, a school record is a
school record.

“The fact that we scored 18
points and that both relays did
well showed that the team has im-
proved since last year,” said Fore-
man. “The freshmen helped a lot
this year. The great number of un-
derclassmen on the team makes
me think we will continue to im-
prove next year.”
