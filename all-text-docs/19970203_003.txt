Burk, Fisher: the
little things count

By Naresu NAGELLA
News Editor

For Junior Buster Burk and
Sophomore Ann Harriot Fisher,
careers in the Student Government
Association have reached new
heights. They achieved that mark
when the student body elected
Burk SGA President and Fisher
SGA Vice President last week.

Burk comes to his position
after being Freshman and Sopho-
more class president as well as
Junior Senator. He says “helping
and asking people’s opinions” has
allowed him to be continuously
promoted and re-elected.

Increased student participa-
tion in the electoral process is
something Burk would like to see.
While both he and Fisher were
happy with the 57% voter turnout,
Burk says, “I wonder why it is not
around 90% at a college like
Davidson.”

Burk wants to see better
“town-gown” relations. He says,
“Finally extending the CAT card
to off campus businesses will defi-
nitely help here.” Right now,
school officials and local busi-
nesses are hammering out the le-
gal details of the proposal to use
CAT cards off-campus.

Overall, Burk says, “I want to

make people happier at Davidson.
And, at times, that can be in fixing
the little things, like pizza at the
Commons, an extra pay phone here
or there, or extra copying ma-
chines.”

Fisher will arrive at her new
position after being a Freshman
senator and Sophomore Class
President.

She credits her successes to
“being able to go out and talk with
many people.” She says, “My
fellow class senators and I had a
good habit of keeping in touch
with a lot of students.”

Fisher lists the initiation of
Dorm Storm, the creation of mi-
nors at Davidson, and contribu-
tion to the overhaul of charters and
bylaws as her previous SGA ac-
complishments.

She hopes to “finish up the
work of the Buford administra-
tion” for next year.

Specifically, she states, “The
Rides Committee needs to be fin-
ished. Also, the Information Tech-
nology Council that will help wire
dorms needs to get started. But,
my personal goal is to increase
SGA participation.” Of next year,
Burk says; “We have a good team.
Weare excited to committing our-
selves to our goal and will help out
in the best possible way.”

The first day in office was a
very busy one for newly elected
Union Board president Matthew
Hobbie.

Meetings-with Union Board
directors and representatives kept
Hobbie occupied for the duration
of last Wednesday evening.

“T think they were alittle con-
cerned because I wasn’t of the
Union fold, but everyone left feel-
ing very confident that we were all

' | on the same page,” says Hobbie.

Last Monday, Junior Matthew
Hobbie was named Union Board
President for the 1997-1998 aca-
demic year.

Hobbie is a former head Inde-
pendent Senator to the SGA and
also served previously as Sopho-
more Class Senator.

As Union Board President,
Hobbie says that one of his major
points of focus will be on making
the Davidson College Union a
model of campus unity. He plans
to work in close conjunction with
the SGA and the Patterson Court
Council in programming campus-
wide events.

“Tdeally the Union should be
a place where both independents
and members of Patterson Court

‘meetings,” says

organizations feel
comfortable hang-
ing out or having

Hobbie is also ”
committed to ex-
panding and diver-
sifying the sched-
ule of social events
held at the Union
Outpost.

“The Outpost
is truly the link be-
tween life on the
Court and life at the
Union,” Hobbie
says. “We want to
have events there
that everyone can
get excited about

and involved with.”

Hobbie says he is very pleased
with discussions he has had with
SGA President Buster Burk and
Union Board Vice Presidents
Michael Bougdanos and Donna
Gribble.

According to Hobbie, the key
buzzwords’ for his programming
strategy are “new,” “exciting,” and
“inclusive.” °

“The Union is on the upswing,
and we can’t be afraid to take some
risks, ruffle some feathers,” says
Hobbie.

While plans for construction
of a new College Union within
Johnston Gym are still in the de-
velopmental stages, Hobbie says
that no matter its location, the
Union must remain a place of
warmth and hospitality.

“Fothink “it’s “important that”
the Union feel like home for
people, ” he says. “By the end of

‘my term I want to be able to say
thatevery member of this campus
community has come to at least
one Union event.”
