students were gathered together and the dele- |

gates were entertained with songs. This is an
institution established for the education of ne-

“Other Goals”

If a “Thousand Dollars” were our
only goal it would be a low aim indeed.
The Student Body Gift Campaign for
Missions has a three-fold objective.
The financial goal is the physical man-
ifestation of a mental concept and
spiritual inspiration, The “Thousand
Dollar Goal” is the outgrowth o

f the:
two objectives outlined below: ~f

1, EDUCATIONAL:

a. To inform the Student Body con-
cerning the Mission Stations of our
Church.

b. To enlarge our vision of the uni-
versal need for Christ. To show the
effect of Christian Missions in the

past and the opportunities of the
present.
c. To inform ourselves concerning

the Executive Committee of For-
eign Missions.
d. To call our attention to the local
objective.
2. SPIRITUAL:
a. To call attention to the
Commission.

Divine

To encourage individual acceptance
and response.

b. To create a spirit of sacrificial
giving.

c. To enrich our individual lives and
our campus life by giving a light
from our torch to those in the
night of despair.
