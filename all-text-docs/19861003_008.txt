: Base ball seas

By EDWIN PAGE
Is it me, or is there something slightly
odd about the 1986 baseball season? Here
it is thé beginning of October, when all
true fans should be enthralled in the heat
of the pennant races, and instead every-
one is napping until the regular season fi-
nally grinds to a halt.

As a National League fan, this has
been a particularly boring year. The Mets
clinched sometime.in late April, and no

team in the NL West has been able to gét ~

within sight of the Astros since the Giants
faded right after the All-Star break. Basi-
cally, there are two good teams in the Na-
tional League and they are in different di-
visions. This does not make for exciting
baseball.

The American League has been a
good bit more surprising and interesting,
but also fajled to deliver a single close
race. Toronto tried valiantly to press the
Red Sox (no pun intended), but Boston,
showing no taste for excitement, went
and won eleven straight games. This is no

way to run‘a pennant race. Sure I’m
happy that the Sox won, but couldn’t they
at least have left it in doubt for another
week or.so?

The Angels surprised everybody by
winning the American League West and
proved that last year’s second place finish
was no fluke, but where were the Royals?
It’s great to see a team like Texas finally
emerge from the depths to finish second,
but could you really ever believe they
might win? Everyone whined so loudly
two years ago when it was a struggle to

‘ stay above .500 and win the west, but I’Il*
take two mediocre teams fighting it out
over no race at all.

The Boggs-Mattingly race for the
batting title is the only thing left to care-
about during the regular season, and it
looks like that might be all but over too.
On Tuesday Boggs, exhibiting a Sox-like
lack of dramatic flair, went four for four
to increase his lead over Mattingly to nine
points.

meet. Freshman Missy Willis and
junior Laura Fannin also placed in
the top 10, finishing fifth and
tenth respectively.

Rounding out the scoring for

the Cats were two women who--

had never run in a cross country
meet before Saturday: freshman

Karen Kemerait, 22nd. Head
coach Gary Andrew was pleas-
antly surprised by their initial per-
formance.

Senior Greg Foreman led the
men to their fourth place finish out
of a 14 team field. He turned in a
time of 27:29, good enough for
11th place in the meet.

The men ran well as a group;

seconds behind Foreman. Junior
Chris Fischer was 15th, sopho-
more Bill Whitfield was 18th,
freshman Jay Clugston was 27th
and freshman David Remisiewicz
was 28th.

“Both teams ran real
strongly,” said Andrew. “Right
now we’re running on strength
and endurance, so any speed. they

’ showed was natural speed.”

Andrew believes the team is
right on schedule with his training ”
program and that speed work be-
ginning immediately will sharpen
both squads as they move into the
Southern Conference season.

“The heat and humidity took
their toll in Saturday’s meet,” said
Andrew. The unseasonable wea-
ther continues to pose difficulties
for the Cats training.
