NAUGHTY SHORTY

Shorty Howell got into a little scrap
‘in Charlotte last Saturday night, and
was invited by a kind man in a blue suit
to spend Sunday in the “cooler.” He
| was the first man brought up before the
| judge on Monday morning.”
| “Well, what have you got to say for
yourself?” asked the judge, this man
charges you with assault and injury.”

“Well, judge, you should have heard
what he called me.” :

“What did he call you to make you
beat him up like that?”

“I just can’t tell you here, judge; but
it was an awful name.”

“Come, now, we have no time to waste,
what did he call you?”

“Judge, he called me ‘another one.’”

doing the Charleston.

Finally the “Special” came in sight of |
Charlotte, and a few boys jumped off and |
ran on in so they might get there early |
enough for a seat. The others waited for |
the train to pull into the station. Special
street cars were waiting for the crowd at
the depot.

Then came to game.

At 11 o'clock Saturday night a tired but
happy bunch left Charlotte for Davidson.
Some discussed the game, some talked about
the dates they had just left, and some few
slept. A song was started but was soon call-
ed off for lack of energy.
