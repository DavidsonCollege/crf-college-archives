Imagine this: Mark Donnely steps to the line
with one second remaining in the Davidson’s
contest versus Appalachian State. The score is
tied. One foul shot would give the Wildcats the
win and secure their first place position in the
Southern Athletic Conference. App State head
coach Buzz Peterson calls timeout to ice the Wild-
cat sniper. Donnely’s uniform lays heavy and
drenched in sweat from a grueling offensive and
defensive battle with opposing Mountaineer Tige
Darner as the battle-scarred Wildcat heads to the
bench.

He grabs a towel to wipe his forehead, sop-
ping with perspiration. While Donnely mops the
sweat once more from the palms of his hands and
drops the towel on the floor, he closes his eyes to
focus on the task at hand.

Meanwhile, amid all the excitement, only
one question echoes throughout the minds of the
Davidson student body and all Wildcat fanatics.

Who is going to pick up that sweaty towel?!?

While laundry may not be the biggest focus

of Davidson basketball diehards, the managers of
the mens basketball team have become a special
part of the Wildcat ballclub.

Half an hour before every basketball practice
in the John M. Belk Arena, three young, dedicated
freshmen are already at work setting up a vast
array of cones, jump ropes, and practice gear,
preparing forthe day’s workout. And amid squeak-
ing sneakers, sweaty tank tops, and shouting
coaches, the three young women also serve as
extra passers in the Wildcat’s drills.

“We take it for granted, but we’ll come run-
ning out for practice, and all the stuff we need will
be right where we need it. We always count on
them,” stated freshman hopeful Travis Ezzelle.

But Beth Hudson, Cat Kizner, and Carrie .

Porath are more than just managers. “It’s almost
like they are part of our team,” said starting sopho-
more forward Stephen Marshall, “except they
have to wipe up our sweat and stuff.”

The tightly-knit atmosphere that character-
izes the Wildcat team has expanded to include the
managers as well.

“It’s kind of like since they have become part
of our team, they have also become part of our

family,” voiced injured swingman Emeka Erege.
The three managers gave him a white stuffed
animal to keep his spirits high while being treated
for a broken leg. “I call him Pookie,” smiled
Erege. The friendly triad has become special in the
hearts of all the players.

While the threesome does not quite share a
fondness for picking up dirty towels and handing
out cups of water, it does share a common love for
basketball.

All three managers starred on their teams in
high school and contemplated playing here at
Davidson, but shied away from the sport for time
commitment reasons.

Still, the thrill of courtside seats excites each
one. Kizner reflected, “The best part of the job is
definitely being right there behind the bench ,
especially during timeouts, hearing what the coach
is saying and what the players are doing. It is just
exciting.”

Yes, the rookie managers clad themselves in
slacks, sweaters, and loafers instead of red and
white uniforms and Nikes, but they must some=
times commit more time to the team than the
players do.

Game days require that the’ rookie managers
be present an hour before tipoff, and for away
games, they have the not-so-rewarding job of
cleaning up the buses after road trips.

Porath heard the basketball team was in dire
need of managers while answering phones in the
athletic office and gathered Second Belk hallmates
Kizner and Hudson at the start of the season.

An athlete herself, Porath plays goalie on the
soccer team. “I just have a genuine love for the
game, and the chance to be in the gym every day
helping a Division I program like Davidson was an
opportunity that I couldn’t let pass me by.”

Though it qualifies for work study credit for
Kizner and Porath, Hudson manages on a com-
pletely volunteer basis fora game she loves. How-
ever, due to her dedication to the team, she was
away on a road trip to Appalachian State and
unavailable to comment for this issue.

So during that timeout in the final seconds,
when Mark Donnely is a foul shot away from
clinching an NCAA tourney bid for the Wildcats,
everyone will know Porath, Hudson, and Kizner
will be right behind them. Literally — behind the
bench, as an integral part of the Davidson team.

Baseball team wins two against Cincinnati Bearcats

Baseball from page 12

In the fifth, the Bearcats. center-
fielder Jud McMillin got things started
with a double. The next batter, Scott
Heller, hit the ball in the gap between
first and second. Drew Williams made
a spectacular play as he dove to his left,
snagged the ball, and threw to first for
the out, saving a definite run.

Not to be outdone, on the next
play, catcher Dom Talvacchio dove
behind the plate to catch a pop-up. It
was another tremendous play.

In the sixth and seven innings,
Stroker used the double play tandem of
Ben Brown and Drew Williams to end
the Bearcat threat.

Stewart Sloan, who has been crush-
ing the ball, started things in the bottom
of the fifth. Sloan hit a long fly ball to
the fence where it was dropped by right-
fielder Matt Singer. Davidson was able
to take advantage of the two-base error
as the next batter, Talvacchio, knocked
Sloan home on a single.

After two singles by Williams and
Brown, Brian Joyce stepped up to the

plate with the bases loaded. Talvacchio
scored when Joyce made out on a
fielder’s choice. Williams followed
Talvacchio as he scored on an error by
Cincinnati’s third-baseman Kevin
Youkilis.

Davidson put the game away in
the bottom of the seventh with five runs
on five hits. Joyce, DeSimone, Sloan,
Talvacchio, and Luke Goodwin all had
hits. DeSimone and Sloan each had an
RBI in the inning. Talvacchio capped
of a strong performance as he finished
3-4 with 3 RBIs. DeSimone relieved
Stroker as he pitched two no-hit in-
nings.

Ryan Stroker isn’t the only fresh-
man who will play an important part
this season. Starting right-fielder
Jeremiah Parvin had a strong game on
Saturday going 1-3, with an RBI, two
runs, and two stolen bases. Friday’s
starter, Wes Self, showed promise in
his six-plus innings of pitching. Mike
Torres, a second baseman from Yon-
kers, New York, started against South
Carolina. “The freshmen will be inte-
gral for our success this year,” said

minutes, the squad took a promising
one-point lead into the locker room.

A 9-2 Davidson spurt to start the
second half spelled defeat for the Spar-
tans, who fell to 7-17, 5-8 in the South-
ern Conference.

Meanwhile, the Wildcats won their
sixth straight and eighth in nine games,
improving to 14-9, and 10-2 in league
action, heading into last night’s contest
at VMI.

Thursday night’s home date with
Appalachian St. will likely determine
the conference’s North Division cham-
pion and top séed in the upcoming league
tournamentat the Greensboro Coliseum.

Wildcats 67, East Tennessee St. 47

Behind an efficient 18 points on 7-
for-10 shooting by Mark Donnelly, the
Wildcats bettered East Tennessee St.
for the second time this season last
Monday night at Belk, winning 67-47.

Davidson shot 56.3 percent from
the field, while limiting ETSU to 33.3
percent, including a 2-for-14 perfor-
mance from beyond the three-pointline.

“Our guys didn’t have a lot of
confidence playing Davidson,” said
Bucs coach Ed DeChellis, whose squad
lost by 50 in Belk last year. “I think
we’ ve got some older guys in our pro-
gram who don’t really believe they can
win against Davidson.”

ETSU’s Greg Stephens, the
Southern’s third-leading scorer, was
held to just 12 points after pouring in 27
earlier this year against the Wildcats in
Johnson City.

Pollard, “Everyone will get to prove
themselves.”

On Friday afternoon, the fresh-
man who made the biggest impact was
a Bearcat, not a Wildcat. Cincinnati's
DH Craig Tewes homered in his first
collegiate at bat.

In the seventh inning, Tewes put .
the Bearcats up 8-2 with his second
three-run home run of the game. This
home run came off Stroker, who had
come in Telief of Fritz Porter.

In his first collegiate start, Wes
Self had some good moments. After
giving up the home run to Tewes, Self
retired 12 of the next 13 batters before
struggling in the fifth.

In Friday’s match-up, Davidson
struggled at the plate. The first three
hitters in the lineup went a combined 1-
11, with three strikeouts. Marshall
Tyler, the new starting third baseman,
had a good game at the plate with two
doubles. Catcher Kurt Davis also had
two hits on the day.

In the end, Davidson fell to Cin-
cinnati 9-3; . 4

Whereas Davidson strug egled atthe
plate on Friday, they rocked Cincinnati
starter Casey McEvoy for eight runs in
just one and third innings. The barrage
continued all afternoon as Davidson
managed 12 runs on 12 hits. All but one
starter for the Cats had a hit. Marshall
Tyler and Stewart Sloan both continued
to hit well. Tyler went 3-5 with four
RBIs, while Sloan went 3-4 with four
RBIs, also. Sloan had botha double and
a triple. .

On the basepaths, Davidson man-
aged nine stolen bases against catcher
Matt Bechtol. The high man was Brian
Joyce with four. Luke Goodwin and
Jeremiah Parvin managed two a piece.

Davidson starter Eric Bowers had
a career-high nine strikeouts in five and
two-thirds innings of work. Given an
eight-run lead, Bowers struggled at
times as he gave up six runs on 11 hits.
After letting Cincinnati back in the

game, Davidson scored two runs in the
bottom of the fifth and one in the bottom
of the sixth.

Bowers was relieved by sopho-
more Garland Yarborough. Yarborough
gave the Wildcats three and a third
innings of near perfect relief. He struck
out three and only gave up one hit. His
only mistake occurred in the top of the
ninth when Cincinnati’s Greg Dikos
homered.

Now Davidson looks towards a
home match-up against arch-rival
UNCC on Wednesday. The tough
Southern Conference schedule doesn’t
begin for several weeks.

When asked about prospects in the
conference, coach Pollard said, “You
can expect the typical mix of Western
Carolina, Citadel, Georgia Southern,
and UNCG at the top,” but also said,
“We took two out of three from a very
good team this weekend. Hopefully,
we'll be able to get everything to click,
and we’ ll surprise some teams.”
