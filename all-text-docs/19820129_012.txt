I jam it through the door

study up straight and SMASH,
swing through singing my meat,
pausing to flick off _
thrumming shards from the frame.

I go.in, shout & beat my drums,
walk slowing up the river.

I continue and there she is,

or there you are, or she, or

whoever you are, or whoever she is.

We approach from opposite shores, —
throw our roots |

to a hard junction over the river.
Solemnly we look at one another
across a mile of flow.

We bow formally and withdraw.

from eyecorners, looking to the next page
