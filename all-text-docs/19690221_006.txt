James Parks, Sophomore: ‘For the

possible to achieve the desired goals.

Quite often it is difficult to get legiti-

mate demands—which these at Duke

because of administrative attitudes to-

Leslie Brown, Senior: “‘The problem
at Duke is found on any of the so call-

‘RIGHT YOU_ARE’
Discrepancies Ruin Mood

A REVIEW
By DICK ANDERSON
Staff Weiter

What is truth?

That is the question pro-
posed by Pirandello’s play
“Right You Are,"’ now being
presented by the Davidson
Drama Department. Through-
out the play Laudini. played
with remarkable skepticism
by senior Dick Poole, tries
to tell the rest of the cast
that truth is strictly relative.
but none will listen.

Instead, they seek feverish-
ly to decide who is mad, the
secretary Poriza who keeps
his wife locked in a tenement.
or his mother-in-law, who be-
lived her dead daughter to
be alive but humors the sec-
retary’s belief that his pre-

sent wife is actually a second
wife. whom he married atfer
the mother-in-law’s daughter
was killed.

and imbalance by junior Tom
Way. while Constance Welsh.
wife of Associate Professor
of Music Wilmer H. Welsh,
does a competent, polished
job as the mother-in-law,
Signora Frola. She should,
as she is the lone profession-
al in the cast. ,

absolute truth. senior Joe

to effectively overcome the
discrepancy between his age
and the age of the character

Drug Case

By PAUL ROWLAND
Associate Editor

The two Davidson juniors
facing drug charges in Prince
William County. Va. are off
the hook, but not necessarily
permanently.

A motion of -“‘nolle pro-
sequi’ was ‘entered at the
hearing last Friday by the
Commonwealth attorney,

The term. means that the
case has not. been dropped
and could be brought back
into court, according to the

court's records personnel.

Such a motion is often
made, according to the legal
aide, when the prosecuting
attorney feels that he has
insufficient evidence to pro-
cede with a trial.

One of the students had
been arrested on charges of
possessing drugs. possessing
marijuana, and a_ traffic
charge of not having car reg-
istration in his possession.
The other student was arrest-
ed on charges of possessing
marijuana and failure to
carry proper identification.

Earlier in the year The

praise from The New York

Rogers, for instance, just
does not come across as the
husband of Signors Sirelli,
played by Ellen Winkter,
wife of associate professor
Julius Winkler.

Mrs. Winkler does well as
a domineering busybody, but
her performance is  over-
showed by that of Mary Rose
Davis. who is as bitingly ap-
ropos as a Peter Arno cartoon
in her role as another local
gossip, Signora Cini.

The type-casting throughout
the cast for minor charac-
ters is well done with only
a few slight exceptions. Sen
ior Ken Fuller as an otiose
se commissioner, freshman
Jack Scott as an aged, al-
most crippled butler. and
Katie MacLean as the in-
genue Dina are all effective
and funny.

Sophomore Al McGraw
tries hard as the prefect who
finally unravels the mystery.
but he just does not look as
old as he ought and he has
not learned to waJk naturally
with a cane.

Generally, though. the cast
performs very well. The sets
are competently carpentered
and designed, and the cos-

tuming. by Mrs. Rupert Bar-
ber, wife of the director, em-
phasizes the ambiguity of the
play in that nearly all the
clothing is black, gray or
white. Particularly Ponza.
his wife, and Signora Frola.
are dressed in keeping with
their roles in a funeral black.

Why then does the play not

come off?
. Part of the problem is that
the play itself is difficult and
slow in spots. Another pro-
blem is that this review had
to be written from a dress
rehearsal to meet the dead.
line, and the cast did not
have the stimulation of a
large audience.

Also, in the crucial line at
the end of the play, Ellen
Johnston as Signora Ponza.
the wife, does not come
through. If she is supposed
to be ethereal, she is not
ethereal enough: if the line
is meant to be spoken plain-
ly. she says it too much like
a ghost. In other words, she
tries both and succeeds in
neither. ;

Overall, the cast does. a
good job, but these annoying
discrepancies creep in to
ruin the mood too often.

three senators appointed by
SGA President Peter Hobbie
to fill ‘vacancies.

The vacancies resulted
from the resignation of the
senators from Cannon, Watts.
and Richardson to run for
senator at-large.

Riner. who will handle this
case himself before the Court
of Appeals, said that his
argument was based on Arti-
cle II, Section i of the con-
stitution, which provides for
the election of all senators
“by and from the residence
halls.”

He also noted that the op-
position case would probably
he based on Article Il Sec.
tion 2/b), which gives the
Senate the power to fill va
cancies.

“The issue here is wether
the SGA president is going to
have the power to appoint a
bloc of senators every year,”
said Riner. “It is nearly cer-
tain that dorm Senators will
resign each year to run at-

large.
“If the present situation is
continued, this will mean

that the SGA president will
have the right to appoint
several senators each year.

“We feel that the new
Senators should be elected
from the districts where the
vacancies occurred. This
will give students better rep.
resentation in the Senate and
remove the possibility of a
‘rubber stamp’ bloc of Sena-
tors who owe their seats to
the president."’ Riner said.

... Allison

(Continued From Page 1)
Allison continued. “‘but the
faculty has not yet. approved
the court."

Allison said that there were
two reasons why the court's
actions have been out of
step with the constitution:
lack of communication with
the faculty and a great many
changes which have occurred
recently.

The writ which prompted
Kavlor’s letter also included

Riner and Rowland agreed
that the Senate issue was
important in that it was to
prevent circumvention of the
Constitution by SGA officers.

Appeals Court Chairman
Dick AlJison said that the is-
sue. will be brought to court
at the request of the student
responsible for the orders, or
when another student can
show that the SGA is crip-
pled by the orders.

{n regard to the order re..
stricting the SEC, Allison,
who is also chairman of the
Constitutional Convention,
said, ‘“‘We took the action
we did when we did because
we felt. they were practical
and necessary. Since several
people object to our action,
I'm certainly willing to have
it settled by the court.”

When asked if he thought
Riner would win his case on
the amendments issue. Alli-
son answered, “I'd bet on it.”

Goldman went into more

saying. “This definition
leaves the Senate a lot of
leeway for action. There are
issues of all sorts whith con
stantly confront us, each de-
manding a different type of
action. It’s up to the Senate
to do what it deems wise in
dealing with each one."

He went on to point out
other facets of the Senate's
duty. “In many instances,
the senate performes a valu-
able service by merely re
cognizing the position’of var-
ious interest groups on the
campus.

“The people backing the
‘Five-year Plan’ were heard
by us. as were those coordin-
ating Coeducation Week."

In assessing his career in
the Senate, Goldman obser-
ved that his personal role
had grown with time. ‘‘I was
electeed last fall, as sen-
ator from Richardson Dorm,
and was elected senator-at-
large in the most recent elec-
tion. As time has gone by.
Uve gotten more and more
involved, so that I’m now in
a position to be as effective
as possible."

In assessing the specific
issues confronting the Sen-
ate, Goldman emphasized
the fact that most issues are
decided by the views of in-
dividual senators. Many
issues boil down to a value
judgement which must be
made by each senator.’’ he
said.

“The vote on ROTC is an
example. In the judgement
of some, ROTC had to be
limited. I personally feel that
