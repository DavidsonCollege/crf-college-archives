POCandSGA Begin Self Selection Study

SGA Surveys Other Schools

By DAVID RESNIK 85

The SGA’s Patterson Court Study
Committee is examining Davidson’s
self-selection system.

“There is a feeling on campus and
within the SGA,” said Committee
Chairman Warren Gould ’85, “that
there is something wrong with the [self-
selection] system.”

The Committee has sent out surveys
to the SGA presidents of thirty schools
that are similar to Davidson in size but
who have different social arrangements.
The surveys ask students to evaluate
their own social systems.

Some of the schools the SGA has
contacted include Bucknell, Duke,
Princeton, University of the South,
Stanford, and Williams.

After self-selection, the committee
will interview hall counselors and the
presidents and rush chairmen of the Pat-
terson Court houses and off-campus fra-
ternities.

The Committee will compare our

Faculty Changes in Mat

By PAULETTE KURANI ’86

Several changes will occur among
Science Department faculty next year:
one professor is retiring, and four others
are going on sabbatical.

Mathematics Professor Richard R.
Bernard will retire at the end of this aca-
demic year after approximately 40 years
in education. Dr. Bernard, who has
been at Davidson College since 1955,
will continue living in Davidson al-
though he plans to spend half of his time
at his other home in Brevard, N.C.

“T will certainly miss teaching,” he
said, “but the time has come for me to
stop.”

He plans to use his free hours fishing
and “learning about the field of comput-
ing and art.”

Dr. Bernard will be replaced by a
temporary professor next year while the
Math Department searches for a suitable
permanent applicant to fill the position
in 1984. Chairman of the Math Depart-
ment R. Bruce Jackson said that it will
require a whole year to find a qualified
candidate.

“Versatility in mathematics is a very
important criteria for applicants,” com-
mented Dr. Jackson.

Associate Dean of the Faculty and
Chairman of the Chemistry. Department
J.N. Burnett left this week for his spring
sabbatical. He plans to research the

system with the others they have studied
and “will come to some conclusion,”
according to Gould.

If the committee decides to propose
another system, says Gould, they will
present the proposal to the campus at
large by means of an SGA referendum.

The SGA formed the Patterson
Court Study Committee at the begin-
ning of the school year. The P.C.S.C.
meets every Tuesday.

The committee consists of Burt
Taylor *84, Minor Hinson °84, Pete
Skillern ’85, Pat Woodward ’84, Bead-
sie Woo ’86, and Keith Revell ’85, but
its meetings are open to all students.

Until now, the committee has not
consulted the Patterson Court Council.
Next week, however, a member of the
P.C.C. will join the P.C.S.C. (see relat-
ed story).

Gould would like to “start cooperat-
ing more with the P.C.C.” because a
joint decision would “carry more

weight.”

and Sciences
study of historical development of
science technology at Princeton Univer-
and then at Indiana University in
April. Dr. Burnett will be back at Da-
vidson College for fall term next year.

Associate Professor of Chemistry
Rodger Nutt also plans a sabbatical. He
will be absent all next year but his desti-
nation and project are still undecided.
Dr. Nutt is presently the acting Chair-
man of the Chemistry Department while
Dr. Burnett is away.

Associate Professor of Chemistry
Merlyn Schuh is currently on sabbatical
and will be returning next fall. He is in-
volved in photochemical research at
Syracuse University.

Associate Professor of Physics and
Professor of Humanities Robert J. Man-
ning leaves on his sabbatical this spring
term. His interest in art history will lead
him and his family to the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C. , the Na-
tional Gallery, and London, England.
Dr. Manning will conduct research for a
historical paper describing the influen-
ces of Nicolaus Copernicus on sixteenth
century art. His essay, “Durer’s Melan-
colia I: A Copernican Interpretation,”
will be published this spring in Sound-
ing, the Journal for the Society for
Values in Higher Education.

There will be no changes in the Biol-

ogy Department next year.

By DAVID RESNIK 85

The Patterson Court Council’s
Committee on House Selection began
studying self-selection two weeks ago.

The committee will try to “come up
with a proposal that is acceptable to
most of the houses on Patterson Court,”
according to chairman Ken Krieg ’83.

Krieg says the committee is “not
shooting to get the Trustees to review it
[self-selection] this spring”; he thinks
the main problem is that “the whole sys-
tem needs to be defined.”

“No one can tell you exactly what
goes on,” said Krieg. “The problem
with oral discouragement” is that “no
one really knows what oral discourage-
ment is.”

“The system as it is written is not
necessarily the one that operates,” he
said.

The committee has “aired some
broad ideas” says Krieg, “but it’s still
too early to tell” what the committee
will do.

Besides defining the system, the

~ PCC Gets Ideas on Paper

committee’s major purpose will be to
“get something down on paper,” ac-
cording to Krieg.

“Every year since I’ve been here the
issue of self-selection has come up,” he
said, “but the people change every year
and we have to start over from scratch.”

Krieg wants his committee to work
with the SGA’s Patterson Court Study
Committee (see related story); he real-
izes that “any major changes will take a
unified effort.”

Self-selection proposals must be
submitted to the Council on Campus
and Religious Life. Any organization
representing the entire student body
may submit a proposal.

The CCRL presents student propos-
als to the College President who must
approve proposals before submitting
them to the Trustees at their next meet-
ing. The Trustees have final authority
on all College decisions.

A representative member of each
eating house is on the House Selection
Committee.
