4 : | | THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 2, 1922.

The $600,000 CAMPAIGN

For Rebuilding Chambers-has promise of success.

I oconsider the crisis which
Davidson College is now facing
one of’ the most serious of its
long and useful career. Chambers
Hall must be established, better
facilities and more professors
provided, or the efficiency of
this old College will be serious—
ly impaired.

Very cordially yours,

Hore PPO os.

Executive Sec. Com. of Christian
Education of Presbyterian
Church in the UU. s;

Count on me for any service
that it is possible for me to
render. I would rather see the
New Chambers building erected
than to see any other piece of
work dene in all the Church or
in all the world. It is the most
urgent need that Il see on the
whole horizon.

Very cordially yours, .

presets

Union Theological Seminary.

Yours in regard to Davidson
College at hand today. I have

North and South and I would rather
send my only son, who is my dearest
earthly trust, to that college -
than to any I have seen. Itisa
live up-to-date college but with
a more earnest spirit of moral and
spiritual idealism than any insti-
tution of its kind that I know

any Lathe about.

Most heartily yours,

a Vornder QorerLur

The Campaign to.raise $600,
OOO for Davidson presents a stra—
tegic opportunity to render large
service to the Presbyterian Church
in the United States. Our Church |
has no more valuable servant and
the College has earned by the con—
tributions it has made to the
whole Church every dollar for
which it now asks. The policy
ought to be a still greater David—
son, for the sake of our common
Presbyterianism.
