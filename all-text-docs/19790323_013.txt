Sophomore Jay Gepfert leads the Davidson tennis team as the
number one singles player this season. The pre-season expectation

was not good, but the team is showing promise.

Foy tops the pack at Fripp Island Invitational

By BILL BAIRD
Staff Writer

Senior Sollie Foy captured his
first collegiate tournament vic-
tory at the final stop of the
Wildcats’ spring trip, the Fripp
Island Invitational. Foy toured
the difficult Fripp Island layout
in just three strokes over par, a
record for the 54-hole event.

His victory was highlighted
by a spectacular two under par
finishing round that enabled
him to run away from the rest of
the field. This outstanding
round (his second subpar per-
formance this year) followed

‘rounds of 75 and 74 for a 149
total and a slim one shot lead
going into the final day’s com-
petition.

Foy handled the pressure of
retaining a lead extremely well

(Gregg Strader)

despite having twelve other
golfers within striking distance.
Foy’s performance was not
backed up by his teamates,
however; the Wildcats as a
group finished in the middle of
the pack.

Prior to the Fripp tourney,
five golfers headed for Talla-
hasse, Florida, to compete in
the prestigeous Seminole Clas-
sic. Pitted against a classy
Southeastern field that included
five of the top ten golf squads in
the nation, it soon became
apparent that the Wildcats were
not prepared for the event.
Snow and the end of term rush
had severly limited practice
time.

The best Davidson could
manage was to battle another
‘‘snowbound’’team, Virginia
Tech, to escape a last place

Young tennis team strives in ‘79 season

By BOB GOULD
Staff Writer
Any fool knows the impor-
; tance of a psychological ad-
vantage in any competitive

| sport. Raw physical talent is

meaningless to the athlete who
cannot harness it. Even the best
athletes can fall to pieces be-
cause of a poor mental attitude.

Nearing the half-way point in
its season, the men’s varsity
tennis team is mentally
psyched. They have developed a
match-toughness that was not
evident at the beginning of the
season. They look to the future
with confidence and a greater
sense of team unity.

Many Davidson tennis fans
originally had some misgivings
about this year’s team, and
they had good reason to. Coach
Jeff Frank lost six seniors to
graduation, four of which
played singles. Jay Gepfert
moved into the number one spot
with no collegiate singles exper-
ience.

Two freshmen were to play at
third and fourth singles. Could

finish. At Tallahasse, the team
was led by Sophomore L.D.
Simmons with a three-round
total of 241. Simmons was
followed closely by Foy, Mark
Hess, Bill Baird, and Mike
Kennedy. Senior Parks Neisler
joined the Wildcats at Fripp
Island.

The ‘‘Sultans of Swing”’ still
look forward to a heavy tourna-
ments schedule that includes
the Elon and Jacksonville Invi-
tationals and the Southern Con-
ference Championship at Pine-
hurst.

The Cats face UNCC at
Charlotte Country Club today
where Joe Davis and Brett
Storm will tee it up for the first
time this Spring. Both players
could play an important role in
the success of the 1979 Wild-

such a young and relatively
inexperienced team even come
close to last year’s 24-5 record?
Only time could tell.

In the first week of matches,
the team found a real test
against some of its toughest

“ competition. It was a dogfight,

but the Wildcats came out of its
relatively. unscathed. They
withstood the pressure. This
gave the Cats a boost of
confidence and alleviated many
underlying doubts among the
fans. ;

Some of the Wildcats’ biggest
wins were against Penn State
(7-2), Purdue (9-0), and_More-
head State (6-3). In the Penn
State match the Cats won all six
singles matches. In the More-
head State match Davidson
took all three doubles matches.
Coach Frank relies on the
“strength of the doubles team”
to pull a match through.

The tennis team has lost to

Atlanta Christian, N.C. State,
U.N.C. and Eastern Tennessee
State (the preseason conference
favorite). Coach Frank didn’t
expect to beat any of these
teams except for possibly At-

> lanta Christian where there

were five three-net matches.
Freshman John Carlin stands
out with an 8-3 record at third
singles this season. He upset
his U.N.C. opponent in the
team’s only singles win on
Saturday. Jeff Lyle is 4-2 at
sixth singles, and Gil Kayton is
4-0 at his position. Nick Petron
and Kayton are 6-1 on the
season at third doubles.
lore the Amherst matches
yesterday, the Wildcats’ record
stood at 8-4. Coach Frank feels
they are psyched for the nine
upcoming matches in the next’
two weeks. The Cats exude
confidence. For a “rebuilding
year” the team is showing a lot
of promise. :

Cat track team improves

By ROB GILLISON
Asst. Sports Editor

The 1979 version of the
Davidson track team has a
problem—how to make up for
the loss of several all-conference
performers. On top of that, in
the last year’s 6-1 season, three
vitories came by margins of
o-ly one point. Coach Karl
Kremser believes that the loss
of these stars, through gradua-
tion and injury, will cost the
team 30 points a meet.

The solution*to this problem
lies in the developing atheletes
now on the team. The potential
for new school records is present
in many events. The addition of
Willie Lanier and Ray Sinclair
have strengthened the weight

events.

Terrazo Wallace is the team’s
leading sprinter. Kremser says
that he is running extremely

well considering the earliness of
the season. Dick Joves has the
potential for some low times in
the high hurdles and Doug
Horn and John Hoots will do
well in the distances.

So far this season, the team is
0-1 in dual meets, losing by
three points to Washington &
Lee. They also came in second
in a thre-way meet, losing to
Campbell and finishing ahead of
Highpoint.

““We just weren’t. ready for
Washington & Lee,” explains
Kremser. ‘‘We really hadn’t

gotten in enough work.”

The team runs against

At an institution of Davidson’s
academic standing, a kind of intellec-
tual honesty and consistency should
be sought in all areas of campus life.
But, as is generally felt, there are
aspects which fall well short of
encouraging an academic atmosphere
and upholding Christian fellowship.
It is obvious that some of these
aspects involve sports and sports
teams in particular. As a matter of
fact, hardly a day goes. by without
sible antics of our women’s swimming
team. :
The problem stems from the trus-
tees’ statement of purpose in allowing
large sums of money to be spent on
Women’s swimming is a brutish
sport, hardly consistent with the
wholesome atmosphere at Davidson
created by the preponderance of
\ upper-middle class students. Surely

we can have good teams in tennis and
golf, since they are basically aristo-
cratic, country club sports—consis-
tent with the Davidson image. But
how can we hope to justify the
admittance of hordes of swashbuck-
ling female swimmers, who are no-
thing but a disruptive influence on the
campus.

The good ones will probably leave
after a year ahyway and go to State
U. where the swimming pools bring in
large revenues and are meant to be
zoos. The remainder will battle away,
trying to make good, with long
practic? hours, and nary enough time
to handle the demanding work load.

But so much for the theoretical.and

moral issues of whether we should

allow such an ou sport be so
highly emphasized. "s get down to
the facts of how these girls are a
detriment to our serene community.
As a resident of a co-ed dormitory,
I feel highly qualified in addressing
the issue of female vi on
this campus. Needless to say, it
seems that every window at this
school has been broken at least once,
much to the dismay of those of us who

enjoy a barefoot , free from the
dangers of b , through the
campus on Giwi spring evening.

What is even worse is when the ladies
invade our halls, pouring beer under
our doors and sabotaging our urinals.

The most outrageous episode was
at the end of last year’s swim season
when the Rusk girls, obviously well
tanked up, waltzed across Patterson
Court and nearly leveled the Phi Delt
and SAE houses.
