Kruse’s Cubby
Much glee

and mirth

By MicHakL Kruse

Romeo & Juliet - Dolby sur-
round sound-style - opened up re-
cently in theatres across the coun-
try, as Hollywood blended
Shakespeare’s classic about the
world’s most famous star-crossed
lovers with the warped, convoluted
society in which we live today.

And warped and convoluted is
exactly what the sports world was
this week, as underdogs prevailed
this way and that.

The lunacy began on Wednes-
day night at the Charlotte Coliseum
- excuse me, the Hive - when the
Hornets and their somewhat inaccu-
rate Hardball motif inexplicably
bettered Shaq and the neo-Showtime
Lakers.

Yours truly attended and not
only laughed with much glee and
mirth at the ubiquitous Hardball
theme, but got a free Hornets-Harris
Teeter calendar. Sweet.

The wild and crazy week, much
like the Wild and Crazy ‘Cat, con-
tinued full-throttle this weekend, as
the college pigskin gauntlet never
failed to boggle the mind.

Your very own Wildcats scored
a fruitful 42 points on Senior Day
Saturday, punishing the Centre
hardly Fighting Colonels.

The six touchdowns added up
to the most points a Davidson grid-
iron group has scored since a 55-
point outburst against Bridgewater
in. 1993.

. The halftime festivities at
Richardson Field paled in compari-
son, featuring that damned Wild and
Crazy ‘Cat shooting T-shirts at an
angry horde at midfield.

The angry horde would tackle
each other in in an impromptu kill-
the-carrier type deal. To the victor
goes the tee.

Can you say lawsuit waiting to
happen? Athletic director Jim
Murphy could.

“T’mnot sure what that promo-
tion was at halftime,” the rookie AD
said during the third quartér up in
the press box. “But let’s never do it
again.”

Good call Jimbo.

Meanwhile, all hell was break-
ing loose on the collegiate gridiron
from sea to shining sea.

Memphis - Memphis - beat sup-
posed wonderboy Peyton Manning
and Tennessee. Purdue beat Michi-
gan, 9-3. Top dog Florida only beat
Vanderbilt 28-21 in perhaps the most
bizarre result of all.

And Iron Mike Tyson re-
sembled a slightly more malleable
metal in falling to Evander Holyfield
Saturday night in Vegas.

In the post-fight press confer-
ence, televised live on all three ESPN
networks, Holyfield offered obliga-
tory thanks toJesus Christ- the Lord
and his personal saviour - over a
dozen times for giving him the abil-
ity to conquer the unconquerable.

And for the fact that he was not
only now heavyweight champ, but
Still alive and relatively well.

Butin this abyss void of sanity
and reason, the women’s soccer team
played the role of trend-bucker,
claiming the Southern Conference
championship with a 1-0 win over
Georgia Southern on Sunday.

Inthe three years women’s soc-
cer has been a sport in the confer-
ence, the trophy has never left the
Big D. ;

Some things never change.

The men’s swimming and div-
ing team (1-2) grabbed their first
win of the season, stomping Rich-
mond, 156 - 86, on Saturday at
Cannon pool. The women (1-2)
fell, 150 - 93.

“We keep track of the all-time
top ten times, and every week we’re
revising it,” head coach Rich

DeSelm said. “That’s gratifying,
and it’s nice to have more talent
and more depth.”

The depth came through for
the men Saturday as they won ev-
ery swimming event except the
200 breast, and took first, second,
and third in two events (200 Indi-
vidual Medley and 200 back) and
the top four spots in the 500 free.

Freddy Schnell, Mike
McCabe, and Scott Harper high-

lighted the men’s victory. ~

Schnell won the 1,000 free
and 200 back, and swam the third
leg of the winning 400 free relay.

McCabe took the 100 and 200
free, and was the anchor of the
victorious 400 medley relay.

Harper— who normally
swims 200 and 400 IM, 200 breast,
or 200 fly— won the 50 and 500
free, and anchored the 400 free
relay.

“We got the big win, but even
more positive than that is how close
everybody is. It’s a lot better than
my team athome with people cheer-
ing for you,” Harper said. “They
(50 and 500 free) were off events
for me, so it felt good to pull them
out.

“I guess that’s where Rich
(DeSelm) thought I’d be best put
to help win the meet, but I don’t
thinkT’ll be swimming those events
much. He (DeSelm) said I’d prob-
ably be swimming some of my
good events from now on. But they
were nice for a change.”

Michael Hart turned in an-
other strong diving performance,
finishing second in the 1-and 3-
meter competitions, while break-
ing his own school record in the 3-
meter with a score of 257.10.

On the women’s side, Mary
Schell Brosche won the 200 Indi-
vidual Medley with the second-
best time ever, 2:10.94, finished
second in the 500 free in a school
and personal record time of
5:10.80, and anchored the second
place 400 free relay. ae

_ Kathleen Paffenroth hadcom-
pany for her iron-woman triple
(1,000 free, 500 free, and 200 fly),
as Jenny Hillmann swam all three
events with her. Paffenroth won
the 1,000, grabbed second in the
fly, and finished fourth in the 500.
Hillmann was third, third, and sixth,
respectively. :

Zannah Bozzone also swam
well, recording a season best
1:58.59 on her way to third in the
200 free, and collecting another
win in the 200 back, 2:11.59...

midfielder Kate McKnight out-

sprinted her defender to a ball that
Linda Rothemund had played

across the Eagle penalty area. She _

one-touched it by Mary Perry for
the game-winner, her only goal
this season.

“(The goal) was amazing. I

hoped and prayed it would go in,

and it did,” McKnight said. “I knew
my first goal would come, but for
it to come at this time is an awe-
some feeling.”

“The difference in the game is
that we were deeper,” coach Kevin
Hundley said. “We’ve got a lot of
different people who can play a lot
of different places, and as coaches
Deb (Biche, ‘the assistant) and I
have to sort out the best combina-
tion and keep everyone happy with
their playing time. That’s been one
of our biggest challenges.”

The Wildcats reached the fi-
nal by stomping App. St. on Satur-
day 10-0, their biggest offensive
output of the year. Georgia South-
ern knocked off Furman 1-0 in the
other semifinal.

In the thrashing of the Moun-
taineers, Amy Balsinger had a hat
trick and Kelly Ammann had two
goals. Ginny Dye, Kelly Schmidt,
and Amy Kanoff each had one
goal’ and two assists, while Rhina
Roberts had a goal and one assist.
Linda Rothemund added a goal,
McKnight three assists, and Lucia
Plosser one.

day, and we were always playing

ter Saturday’s win. “Tomorrow, I
want to go out with a bang. Win-
ning the tournament has been one
of the goals all season. I want to
make it happen, and go out hard.”

Eagles for the third time this sea-

“Tt was tough. We knew it

would be a hard fought game; we

(Melissa) Moser did a great job,
and the defense all around,”
McKnight said. “I’m really happy
for the seniors.”

“This was the sweetest,”
Plosser said. “It was my last one,
and for me this was the best. This

We dominated. It’s sweet.”

Ammann and Balsinger joined
Cornelius on the all-tournament
team. In addition, Moser, Kelly
Rennick, Ammann, Dye, and
Noznesky were named first-team
All-Southern Conference earlier in
the week. Noznesky was honored
as the regular season conference
MVP.

Men’s soccer falls to Furman in tournament semifinal

GREENVILLE, S.C. - The
men’s soccer team ended its sea-
son on Saturday with a 4-0 loss to
Furman in the Southern Confer-
ence semifinals.

On Friday, the fifth-seeded
Wildcats avenged a 1-0 regular
season loss to App. St., edging the
Mountaineers, 2-1, in the

quarterfinals.

The victory gave Davidson
their second win in three games,
and with the Wildcats playing
seemingly more spirited soccer
than they did much of the season,
Davidson players were confident
going into Saturday’s matchup
against top-seeded Furman.

“We knew we played well
against App. St.,” said goalkeeper
Brad Stroble. “It gave us some

confidence that we haven’t had for
a lot of the season.”

But the 13th-ranked Paladins
proved to be too much. Ryan

‘Higginbotham led Furman with a

hat trick. Davidson fell two goals

_ behind at intermission, and despite

controlling much of the second
half, the Wildcats, like throughout
much of the season, were unable to
find the back of the net.

“T thought we played them

better than the first time around (a
4-1 loss),” said Slagle. “But we
still had trouble scoring goals, and
to win in this game, you need to
score.” ;

Phil Julien got Davidson go-
ing on Friday, scoring in the 25th
minute off of a Keith Kleeman
assist. Robert Clarke, the Wild-
cats’ leading scorer this fall, gave
