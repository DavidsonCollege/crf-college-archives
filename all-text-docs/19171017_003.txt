The meeting of the Phi Society last
Saturday night was taken up entirely
with the question of the welfare of the
children working in the cotton mills.
The first part of the program was a de-
bate on the query: “Resolved. That the
Keating Child Labor Law should — be
sustained.” °

The affirmative side of the question
was presented by R. W. Robinson and
C. W. Worth. ‘The negative was up-
held by R. H. Stone and W. M. Currie.

‘The gentlemen of the affirmative con-
tended: (1) ‘That working a child de-
prived him of an education and the joys
and privileges which are rightly due him:
(2) that the Jaw was constitutional, and
(3) that it was the best way to deal with
the situation.

‘The arguments of the negative were:
(t) That the law protects interstate
commerce rather than the children: (2)
that it is not comprehensive enough in
its protection, and (3) that it is wrong
economically,

After the debate there were two ex-
temporancous orations. Both gentlemen
carried out the same line of thought as
the debate.

R. Kornegay, Jr..
wave the orations.

In the Eimenean Society, Saturday
night, C. F. Allen and W. J. Huneycutt
upheld the affirmative of the question:
Resolved, ‘That the Keating: Child a-
bar Law should be sustained. “Phe Keat-
ing bill attempts, by prohibiting the in-
terstate commerce of all articles manu-
factured by children under ty years of
age, to prohibit child labor, “The affirm-
atvie argued: (1) ‘That is is constitu-
tionally legal; (2) that it would accom-
plish its purpose of preventing child
labor, and should therefore be sustained.
‘The negative, upheld by Smith and J. R.
Woods, sharply attacked the bill. argu-
ing: ()a That it is an indirect rather
than a direct blow at child labor; (2)
that it is a blow aimed by Northern
leaders of Congress at the industries of
the South; (4) it is a blow at state's
rights by giving the Federal Government
too much power. The committee to de-
cide upon the merits of the question
voted in favor of the affirmative, the
house voting in favor of the negative.

Following the debate orations were
delivered by J. B. Woods, Jr.. who spoke
on “Kerensky,” and br Andrew Brown,
who spoke on “Debates in the Eumenean
Society.”

The president announced an election
of officers to be held Saturday night, Oc-
toher 20.

SHALL WE ADOPT |

HOOVER'S MEATLESS DAY?

The condition of Eurupe with her,
s
compels the serious consideration of the |
men and women of America ot the fact
that America must teed the nations
with whom she is allied or in the near.
future America must fight) Germany
alone. This the substance of the
words of Dr. Martin at chapel on last
Monday.

lmmediately afterwards at least one
boarding house took up the matter and
Mrs. Manning's house is to observe one
meatless meal each day. Flora Macdon-
ald College was the one Dr. Martin re
ferred to as observing one wheatless an |
one ettless day cach week and ony
sugariess meal each day.

This plan is one of Food Adiniais
trator Hoover's and is being adopted in
many parts of the country. It is are:
gretful fact, that either because they lack
the strength to live thru a dav without
meat, or lack the patriotism te do all in

their power for the bovs in the trenches, [

some are unwilling to dens then eves:
nevertheless it is rumored that other
houses will soon line up in the National
Food Conservation campaign.
