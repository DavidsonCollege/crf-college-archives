Traveller

There are things worse than Missis-
sippi and Alabama. An enema is one.
The Black Hole of Calcutta is another.
The enema does reach its agonizing
conclusion however, and the Black
Hole is no more. Mississippi and
Alabama are the worst things I can
think of. Let me tell you why.

Lou-iss-ville

One’s credibility is strained when a
broadcasting team that calls itself “The
finest braodcasting team in these
United States” employs an anchorman
who pronounces Louisville Lou-iss-
ville. Credibility is further strained
when this station's own sportscaster
calls innings “endings” or when a
station manager looks at a clock on the
wall, visible on the television screen,
that shows the time to be 12:37 and
announces it as 12:32. Well, these
things happened in Mississippi.

Perhaps in talking about a state like
Mississippi which so recently crashed
its way into the 19th century we should
not quibble with minutes.

There is so much more to Mississippi
than professional readers who can't
read. The very moment that the
traveller crosses the border, he real-
ises that he\is in big trouble. Planted
just across the border is a sign which
says in the biggest, blackest letters
that the state could muster, “Out of
stati: vehicles pull off the road.”

Pull off?

Where do we pull off? God only
knows. There was nothing but a
swamp on either side of the road.
Mississippi likes to drown out of state
cars with out of state residents in
them, it seems.

Why do we pull off? This is really the
frightening question. All that comes to
mind is the final scene in Psycho where
Anthony Perkins stands nervously by
the swamp while a sheriff pulls the
victim's car out of the-mire.

. As I drove along, -all the other
drivers began to look like Anthony

Perkins. I think two weeks into the
future. An FBI agent is pulling my car

out of the swamp, as the mayor of
Bessemer, a state patrol officer, and,
say, the governor of Mississippi look
on. The agent looks in the door of the
car, vomits and they have to send to
North Carolina for my dental plates to
make a positive identification.

Disguised weigh station

Or suppose we survive the pulling off
the road and a gate clangs shut behind
us in a place cleverly disguised as a
weigh station. I'm led into a
Kafkaesque room where people in
black robes are staring at me. Being
nineteen years old, there is the chance
that] am somewhat to the left of Louis
XIV, a fact that does not stand me in
good stead here in Mississippi.

They keep looking at me. Mumble-
mumble-mumble. “He has a college
sticker on his car,” I hear them say.
“Could be an activist. We of the
orthodoxy committee must act with
regard to this potential importer of
revolution.” A Nordic type comes at
me with a sword. “Wait a minute! I ery.
“I subscribe to the National Review!...”
Well at least this time they didn’t have
to send for my dental plates.

But for the grace of God that would
have been my fate. I was also saved by
the fact that I put my head down and
drove like a sonofabeech, as they say in
Bessemer. Yet my way was still laid
with untold horrors, including barrels
in the middle of interstate 20 that had
no reflectors or lights on them. .After
swerving mightily to miss them, I
wondered if they weren't what they

told you about when you pulled off the
road,

RUD-927

Even the state of Mississippi could
not have stuck RUD-927 out there to
get us. RUD-927 was being Mississip-
pian independently of any higher
authority, I feel sure. I didn’t even
know RUD-927 existed until our bum-
pers (his back, my front) were roughly
coexistent in the same place at the
same time.

Just before I blitzed him, I saw that
RUD-927 had no lights on. Not wishing

slammed on my brakes with such force
that I was almost forced to PULL OFF

ployed by the state. Well, I screamed
at him, and he told me to go the hell.

I obliged RUD-927 by heading
straight for Alabama. Though I vague-
ly realised what I was getting into, I
nevertheless experienced a surge of
hope because I was leaving Mississippi.

Yugoslavia to Bulgaria

My good feeling. was short lived.
Crossing from Mississippi to Alabama
is analogous to leaving Yugoslavia in
favor of Bulgaria.

Alabama billboard but that of Govern-
or Wallace, looking like Cerebus at the
gate of Hades.

Lake Lurleen

Now that was difficult to palate in
itself. But I came upon an equally large
billboard with an equally large picture
on it, this time of Wallace's late wife
Lurleen. LAKE LURLEEN, it said.
Skiing, boating, picnicking. The sign
painter graciously forebore adding
something like “Memorialize the stiff,
swim Lurleen for only 50 cents.”

Somehow I can’t see Winston
Churchill, for instance, capitalizing on
the death of his wife by opening Lady
Churchill's Fish and Chips. But the
Churchills never lived in Alabama.

Staff Writer

Joseph Jongen (1873-1953)
was a gifted Belgian composer
whose musical triumph is con:
sidered to be the skillful orches-
tration of his Symphonie Con-
certante.

Composed in 1933, this work
represents one of the few
successful attempts at writing
for both Organ and Orchestra.
The Organ is used here as a foil
to the musical forces of the
Orchestra not as an addition to
them; therefore, the traditional
symphonic form takes on some

of the characteristies of the
Concerto. Hence the derivation

of the name of this work.

The four movements are : a
Sonata-Allegre form in the
Dorian Mode, two elegant slow-
er movements, and finally a
Toccata exploiting the idioma:
tie qualities of the Organ.

The recording was made by
the Paris Opera Orchestra,
Georges Pretre conducting,
with Virgil Fox at the Organ.

The Orchestral playing is
well-balanced and clean. Mr.
Fox is fortunate to have at his

disposal a fine French Romantic.

organ built by Aristide Ca-
vaille-Coll in 1878 and rebuilt
by Victor Gonzales in 1938.

The sound is magnificent.
Fox's playing is unusually re-
strained yet full of life and
technically superb.

The recorded sound is excel-
lent early stereo although a bit
more reverberation might have
blended the sound better.

The result of all this is a
thrilling listening experience.
Jongen has a Classical approach
to.form and melody that ap-
peals through its simplicity and
elegance. ‘His harmonic lan-
guage is late Romantic al-
though the influence of the
Impressionists is late Romantic
and also present, with their
novel use of sound colors.

This Symphony is a satisfy-
ing work of art. It is well worth
going off the beaten track to
hear it.

Coming next time: The Piano
music of Maurice Ravel.
