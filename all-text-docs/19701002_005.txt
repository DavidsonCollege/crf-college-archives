‘Peterson Says Queens
Girls Are Underrated

I often became fearful that
the Davidson student, once
here, fabricates a «curious
intelectual elitism, seeming-
ly content to sit around on
his fat SAT score and do
nothing.

Along with the fear comes
the wish that you just would-
n’t do that! After all, damn
few of us are aS smart as
we'd like our mothers to be-
lieve.

Point being, due to .this
intellectual snobbery a whole
lot of us feel it would be

below the belt-leve! of our

dignity to engage a Queens
girl in ‘‘heavy” ~ conversa-
tion, and most of us would
much prefer to engage her in
a session of heavy breath-
ing.

Surprise! Surprise! From
a statistical analysis of this
years Queens freshmen class
(Queens Current, September
4, 1970) I deftly surmised that

“they just ain’t as dumb
as we think.”
Eighty percent of that

class: ranked in the top two-

fifths of -their high school-

graduating class. Mean SAT
verbal for these coeds was
526.2, mean SAT math was
509.4, which totals 1033.6
Not bad.

I can recall being told last
year, before my first blind
date at Queens, that my
SAT scores would be almost
twice that of the average
Queens girl. Ain’t true, just
ain’t true.

I have come to the con-
clusion that part of the stig-
ma we hold for Queens is
due to the fact that a great

-many Davidson gents are
selective and cunning enough
to ferret out the not-so-bright
one from ‘“‘that school”. in

Charlotte (By the way, SAT .

scores are not the end all of
intelligence). It might be
“plausible that through our
hum-drum stimulus we tend
to entourage stay-in-your-

rightful-place responses from
these girls?

Maybe we ought to. rid
ourselves of our false in-
tellectual elitism, beginning
with a renovation of the Da-
vidson-Queens relations, That
would seem to be the truly
enlightened action on our
part.

Like our janitor, Herman,.

said to my roomy ‘Tuesday
morning, ‘‘What it all boils

down to is that there is good’

women, and there is bad wo-
men, and the man got to
choose.”

Davidson Man At Hollins
Finds New Home Familiar

1 begin by refusing to
answer the question’ I
haye been asked more than
five thousand’ times since
February: ‘“‘Why are you go-
ing to Hollins for a year?
Isn’t it a_ girl’s school?”
Figure it out for yourself.

There are nine of us here:
five of us from’ Davidson,
two from Washington and
Lee and two: from Randolph-

. Macon. We're living in an

old house on Rt. 11, one-
half mile from the Hollins
campus.

Hollins geographically is a
schizophrenic -place. Rt. 11

_Tuning north out of Roan-

oke is a-seemingly endless
stretch of prole food places,
service stations, and motels
—even worse than Indepen-
dence Boulevard in Char.
lotte.

: also suspect that Route

1 is the only north-south
‘aha route this side of
the Mississippi.

Several hundred yards off
this thoroughfare is Hollins
College — pastoral, quiet,
bounded by sloping pas-
tures and mountains.

Hollins is in some way
much like Davidson. Found-
ed in 1824, its average stu-
dent tend to fall into broad
catagories.

There is the W&L--UVA—
Every-Weekend Crowd, Mem-
bers of this group are easily
spotted every Friday after-
noon scampering across cam-
pus, American Tourister in
hand. .When engaged in con-
versation, they reveal en-
cyclopedic knowledge of
every fraternity (and _ its
notable -members) at every
college in the area.

If one doesn’t happen to
catch a representative of this
species on Friday, or talk
to her during the week, just
look for a_ girl with a
guy wearing black-and- white
shoes and a three-pound frat-
ernity pin sagging down his
monogramed alpaca sweat-
er; sitting inside a late-model
GTO. It’s a dead give-away.

One-hundred-eighty degrees
away is the Hip Squad (A
social, not anatomical cate-
gory). Favorite pastime of

_ this. genre seems to be sit-

ting on the Main Quad in
bells and tee-shirts groovin’
on the trees and grass (take
it either way) and really be-
ing ‘‘into” things.

I learned from a hip per-
son that we are either in
the midst of “The Revolu-
tion” or:on the verge of it.
I forget which, Between these
two poles are various other

student - types, including the
Connie College variety, who
wear a half-dozen different
hats and is constantly col-
lecting money for something;
feminists; and Pseudo-Hip
People, whe are distinguish-
ed from Non-Pseudo-Hip Peo-
ple in that they drive Pors-
ches to ant} from the Main
Quad.

Fortunately there are many
Students who don’t fall into
these and other narrow little
niches. These are individuals
who don't fit neatly any-
where on my _ categorical

spectrum—the real people
you want to get to know.

Reactions to our being here
vary from ‘Don’t you feel
strange here? (to which I
have learned to reply, ‘No,
do you feel strange here?”),
to’ mistaking: us for W&L
freshmen trying to pick
anyone up, to real attempts
at making us feel welcome.

Revelation of the Week:
any institution which separ-
ates men from women ‘and
thus reduces their: relation-
ship to weekend marathons
is by nature perverted.

LETTER

Thorne Defends Noise
As ‘Friendly Rivalry’

To the Editor:

Will Rogers once said, ‘‘All
I know is what. I read in the
newspapers.”

In the Sept.-25th issue of
the -Davidsonian appears a
letter, which if taken scrious-
ly would cause one to believe
a great rift is present .in
the class of 1974.

The subject under’ con-
demnation appéared to be
noise. Yet, the overtones of
the letter connotated the en-
thusiasm thus °far exhibited
by our freshman class.

The friendly and enthusias-
tic rivalry of the freshman in
East and Cannon dogmitories
is neither new nor alien to
the Davidson campus. En-
thusiasm is a vital and neces-
sary force to any successful
campus imdividual, class or
institution.

The Class of 1974 has thus

far exhibited much enthu-

siam, yet a few individuals

wish this to be quelled.
The question of noise can

_ no longer be the -issue: The

real issue is a challenge to
the freshman class—will it
be an/enthusiastic and out-
8 class or a stagnant
pool effete individuals
scared to be even slightly
human?

. Robert Louis Stevenson
once said, ‘‘A dash of en-
thusiasm is not a thing to
be ashamed of. If St. Paul
had not been a very zealous
Pharisee, he would have
been a much colder Chris-
tian.”

“The blossoms of these
newly planted seeds. will
either bear the fruits of
greatness or: freeze in the
chill of uniformity.

So, to those members of
the Class. of 1974 who have
that precious. seed of enthu-
siam, I say ‘Right On.”
