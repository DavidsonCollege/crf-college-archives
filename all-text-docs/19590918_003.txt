‘Cats Meet Catawba In Grid O

Davidson Gridders Out To Avenge.’58 Loss

SIDELINES
ON SPORTS

By B. MILLNER

THE CATAWBA GAME tomorrow night is not just
another opener with a pushover North State Conference’
humpdy dumpty. The Indians are a good, sound ball club
—not as good as V.M.1., Richmond, Lehigh, or the Cita-

. del—but good, just the same.

Furthermore, this game assumes an importance
that can be associated with no other contest on the sched-
ule. If the Cats have the desire and talent to get by
Catawba, they’re on their way. If they don’t, we might
as well throw in the towel.

The coaching staff seems to have done a fine job
in bringing the Davidson team along for this game. In-
juries are at a minimum in spite of two-a-day contact
workouts since Sept. 1. Perhaps most important, the
players aren’t selling Catawba short; they have a good
mental attitude according to Coach Dole.

The abstinence on the players’ part of Rush Week
indulgences on sleep and rest should prove valuable.
They were bleary-eyed before last year’s game and “‘dis-
integrated” in the fourth quarter.

This is a big one for the ‘Cats. We'll just have to
waft—and hope.

Dole, who was openly en-
thusiastic about his much pub-
licized “pro-type” offense at
this time last year, is close-
mouthed about tomorrow
night’s game, which will be
played at 8 p.m. in Charlotte's
Memorial Stadium.

“We're further ahead now
than we were at this time last
year,” he admitted, and guard-
edly said that the Wildcat, de-
fense would be better this sea-
son.

“We've been working for bal-
ance in practice. I just hope
the sophomores come through.”

DICK McKEE was probably the most widely-liked
member of the Davidson College faculty and administra-
tion. The little man, whose face is a patch of wrinkles just

from grinning, has headed for greenerf
pastures and we’ll miss him. When Mc+
Kee accepted the Furman offer to teach
tennis and head the sports publicity de
partment, Davidson lost its most suc
cessful coach.

His teams here were consistently at
the top of Southern Conference stand

McKee will have some scholarship aid at Furman.
He will also serve as teaching pro at the Greenville
Country Club. We’re sorry he left, wut we can’t really
blame him.

A prediction: Furman will take home the Southern
Conference Tennis Championship within four years.

COACH CHARLIE PARKER spent eight weeks at
Camp Lejeune this summer training a 16-man All-Marine
wrestling team. In late July he took his boys up to Michi-
gan State for the Pan American Games tryouts. Eight
of his pupils made the American team.

Parker is a member of the Olympic Wrestling Com-
mittee.
Also at the gigantic Pan-Am show in Chicago were
Dr. Tom Scott and Coach Joe Hunt, who went up to
watch the basketball championships.

SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS have been made on
the athletic facilities here. Additional dressing quarters
have been added under the west stadium seats and a
watering system has been installed in the centerfield
area of the baseball field.

With inexperience the by-
word at guard and halfback,
what is the outlook for '59?
Will the ‘Cats crumble if in-
juries should shift the load
from the Capable shoulders of
seniors Charlie Benson and
Dave Warden? Will this be Bill
Dole's first losing season in
six years or will it be his best?

Only time can answer these
questions but a look at the op-
position might at least provide
a basis for some educated
guessing.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

By B. MILLNER
Davidsonien Sports Editor

Coach Bill Dole sends his thin corps against Catawba tomorrow night in what may be the most important
game of the 1959 season. In last year’s opener the Indians shocked Davidson 22-17 for the first Catawba vic-
tory ever recorded over a Davidson football team.

The tackles are manned by
Frank Anderson, Tom Simp-
son, John Watwood and Scott
Lacy. This position is deeper
than any other on the squad.
Watwood, hampered of late by
cracked ribs, is ready to go at
full speed but up-and-coming
Tom Simpson will start at right
tackle.

John Crute and converted
tackle Alex Porter fill the key
guard slots, and dependable
Harold Bynum is back at cen-
ter.

Again, much of the. success
of the Wildcat offense de-
pends upon fullback Dave
Warden and southpaw Char-
lie Benson, an all-conference
candidate eat quarterback.
