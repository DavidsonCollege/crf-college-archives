THE PROBLEM OF THE
LITERARY SOCIETY

“Once to every college man there
comes a time when he can seize an op-
portunity to affiliate himself with an or-
ganization whose purpose it is to fit him
for duties of life.” And it is only one
time—during his college career.

At the present time less than one-half
of the student body are even nominal
members of either of the two literary so-
cieties. Twenty years ago practically
every student in college took an active
interest in society work. There is some-
thing radically wrong, either in the or-
ganizations, or in the ideals of the stu-
dents, or in some other external cir-
cumstances.

To enter into a discussion of all the
causes which have combined to lessen the
interest in or the calibre of the literary
societies, would be more than the space
in this column permits. But without
stopping to discuss the causes for the
decline of interest, let me proceed to
offer some remedies by which I believe
existing conditions may be remedied. If
these suggestions are to become effective
practically the whole matter lies with
the Faculty.

THE SPECIFIC PLAN

I believe that a new course in theoreti-
cal and practical public speaking should
be added to the regular curriculum—
the course to be taken up in the Fresh-
man year and required of all those who
expect to receive a diploma except those
who join a Literary Society in their
Freshman year and do in the society
certain prescribed work. 1 realize that
there are objections to this plan, but
with all of its objections 1 believe that
it is a step forward.

There are some colleges—not very
many, it is true—which require of all
their students that they affiliate them-
selves with a literary society. “Vhere arc
also some colleges and universities—and
the number is increasing—which are
adding to their curricula) a course in
theoretical and practical public speaking.
The University of North Carolina has
instituted such a course. Of the two
alternatives or plans I believe the lat-
ter, with modifications as I have sug-
gested, is preferable.

AS TO RESULTS

1 think it is manifest that a twofold
result will follow if such a course be
added to the curriculum: First, it is
perfectly reasonable to believe that a
larger number of new men will join the
literary societies at the bdginning of
their college career. Second, those who
do not join the literary society will be
provided with an opportunity to improve
themselves in the matter of public speak-
ing and debate.

In most high schools there is no wav
to escape from participating in such an
activity. Here at Davidson there is a
way of escape, and, as we see, more than
one-half of the students escape. Out in
the world we find this particular need:
men of all walks of life, college men, of
course, more frequently, are confronted
with the well-nigh inescapable duty of
facing « public audience to give expres-
sion to his thoughts. What do we act-
vally have? Fewer men are preparing
themselves for such duties and privileges
of life.

This, briefly stated, is the problem of
he literary society at Davidson and one
-uggestion for the remedy of the evil.
What shall we do with the problem?

A NEED.

According to Tennyson, “In the
spring a young man’s fancy lightly turns
to thoughts of love.”” But it seems as if
around Davidson many fancies are also
turning to thoughts of horseshoes and
campus baseball. This indeed is nat-
ural, far more natural than convenient.
For on these lovely days, between show-
ers, every one wants to be out of doors.
‘Then again the campus does not make
such a desirable ball ground either for
the ones taking part in the game or for
hose who stay in their rooms and study.
We can realize this when we remem-
ber that our college grounds are various-
ly spotted with trees, walks and some
buildings.

This process of tearing up the campus,
batting out window panes and raising a
grand uproar tends to remind us of what
a pity is is that there is not some ground
that could be used by the average college
fellow, especially those who seem to be
still of high school caliber.

There is in fact no sport that can be
enjoyed by all, as basketball seems to be
at a low ebb. The tennis courts are in
bad shape and we do not all feel called
toward Varsity baseball and track. So
we find ourselves much in need of a
sporting ground that does not infringe
on the rights of others, that does not, on
account of its proximity to the dormi
tories, entice us out for a game in our
best ‘clothes when we really expected to
spend the time on something else.

WHY DOES NOT THE
COUNCIL ACT?

The threefold outcome of the much
discussed trial last week by the Student
Council has practically forced to an act-
ive issue of the question of the survival
of student self-government here at Dav-
idson. The fact that men who were
clearly guilty of drinking were practi-
cally dismissed by being given the slight-
est punishment possible; the fact that a
Freshman was not punished even tho he
openly showed contempt for the highest
body in student life here; the fact that
not only was this Freshman permitted to
publicly tell how he “horsed” the coun-
cil, but that councilmen themselves
spread a report of the council’s disgrace
around the campus—all of these have
tended to reduce the council to a ridicul-
ous position in the cyes of the student
hody. ‘They have not only made a
‘Joke out of the council, but have pre-
sented the long-pending question — of
whether or not the council, as a regular
institution, is able to handle such miat-
ters of discipline.

Student self government as a means
of teaching young men independence is a
splendid institution, As a means of dis-
ciplining a college, here and elsewhere,
it seems to be a force. It is a fact that
it is practically impossible to persuade a
council to act with any degree of stern-
ness in anv matter where the evidence is
not so absolutely convincing that a blind
man could see it. But the council is not
always to blame for its inaction. In the
vresent case there were two reasons why
the council was helpless. The first of
these was the constitution; the second

the student body, who could have re-
versed an adverse action of the council.
The council is sworn to uphold the con-
stitution. A man was indicted for drink-
ing. He answered that the clause in the
“moral code” specified “repeated drunk-
enness,”’ and asked the council to prove
that he was guilty. Or take a case of
“hazing” that comes up.. A man is in-
dicted for paddling a Freshman. The
Freshman objected, but the whole affair
was a friendly bout. Under the consti-
tution the council must decide the man’s
guilt. If they find him guilty, he must
be expelled, according to tradition. It
becomes a difficult question. Or go back
to the Freshman’s defiance of the coun-
cil. Is it healthy to allow a Freshman
to defy the council? He should be tried
for “contempt,” but there is no such law
in the constitution.

Suppose, however, that the council
had found the man guilty of drinking
and expelled him. At once, he would
have appealed to the student body. ‘The
council was of the opinion that the stu-
dent body would have reversed them.
The council says that the student body
does not want to enforce cither the
drinking or the hazing law. And the
power of the council ultimately rests on
the student body. It cannot do anything
against the. will of the students,

The result is that the prestige of the
council has been lowered. Already men
onenly break the laws of the constitution.
They know that they will not bé re-
ported or that if thev should be, they
would not be punished. As it is, no one
but councilmen feel their responsibility
about reporting cases. At present, too,
the students resent the interference of
the facutly in matters of discipline. Last
vear when Dr. Martin stopped “snow-
balling” the students were indignant.
Yet their council has not—and never
would have—stopped it. At present, dis-
cipline on the campus is practically in
the hands of no one. The council is
helpless. The faculty cannot act with-
out abolishing self government. Either |
a revision of some kind must be made or
this latter result should take place.

In the first place, the idea that the
Faculty has no right to interfere in such
matters is a false one. The Faculty
must set the moral policy of the college
else this will change every four years.
Again, they actually have charge of the
