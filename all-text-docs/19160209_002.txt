YOUR PART.

‘Thr Davivsontan wants your opin-
ions. If you are an alumnus, a student,
oY just one interested in the college, and
have an opinion, whether it be a criticism
or commendation, and think it worth put-
ting before twelve hundred subscribers.
each with their circle of friends, and all
interested in the college, then send your
article in to us and we will see that it has
a place.

To the alumni and students especially
do we make this appeal. It is not be-
cause we do not have enough to fill the
paper. [ach week, with barely touch-
ing the surface, we have more than
enough material for the paper. But we
realize that at best, the Staff and Report-
ers represent only a very small portion
of the college,

Let us have your ‘pet’ theories, espe-
cially if they be ones which you had
-when you were in college, and which
have been strengthened by your life since
leaving college. Or it may be that as a
student, with the, more intimate know!l-
edge of student affairs, you have worked
out something worth while, and if so, we
do not believe that it will be given bet-
ter attention than through these columns.

We believe that it is in your power to
strengthen “He Davinsonian two-fold
by your active interest. Without re-
ward, outside of the experience gained,
we are endeavoring to put out the best
possible paper. Will you do your part?

The Young Women's Missionary Cir-
cle will meet Thursday afternoon at 4
o’clock with Miss Nora ‘Phompson.

CLASS BASKET BALL.

To keep up the forward steps David-
son has been making in basket ball as a
major sport, and to enliven the interest
in the game as well as to develop ma-
terial for the coming Varsity teams,
Coach Kluttz is planning to begin soon
a spring session of class basket ball. It
is planned to run a short schedule of
class games, and also to have different
leagues in the sport, comprised of dor-
mitory teams, sectional teams, etc.

- SUCCESS OF COLLEGE MEN.

“Since the United States was founded,
only one man out of every seven hun-
dred and fifty has gone through college.
yet from this group have come 17 of the
president, 19 of the vice-presidents, and
17 of the persons in the Hall of Fame.
Only 1 per cent of our present popula-
tion are college people, yet this small per-
centage furnishes 29 of the 51 governors
of states and territories, 61 of the 93
United States senators, 272 of the con-
gressmen, and 9 of the 9 Supreme court
judges. ”’—-Exchange. ‘|

The first call for the last year’s Var-
sity base ball squad was sounded Mon-
day afternoon. and the uniforms were
distributed. The first appearance of the
squad at batting practice drew an inter-
ested speculative audience from -the stu-
dent body.
