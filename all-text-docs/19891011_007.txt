vandalism in town and on campus.

Terry praised Vail Commons staff
for their swift and kind response to
the crisis. All students and workmen
were served free meals.

said Carl Pritchard, director of auxil-
iary services. “More people drank
milk than at any other time.”

Although the Commons’ electric-
ity was not restored until Saturday
afternoon, refrigerated food had
been prepared Friday before it had
time to spoil. Frozen foods were not
threatened because freezers did not
have time to thaw, said Pritchard. ‘|

Asa result, only about $500 worth
of food was lost due to spoilage, he
added.

Pritchard recognized the contribu-
tion of cooksand sanitation staff who
worked overtime throughout the
weekend.

through with flying colors,” he said.

Friday morning students were
helping ground crews clear the de-
bris. A few -unfortunate students
woke to discover that their cars had
been crushed by trees. Senior
Suzanne Craymer discovered that a

Accord, causing damages worth
$3,000.

Students feel that the college com-
munity handled the crisis well.

“I thought they reacted the best
they could,” said one senior. “The
Commons serving us food was won-
derful and I thought it was so neat
that students were out helping.”

Meetze said that every tree felled
willbe replaced so that the total num-
ber will return to 2000.

Jim Leach, a sophomore from
Savannah, Georgia, shares the senti-
ments of many Davidsonians.

“I was really happy that I have a
home to go to for fall break,” he said.
"I feel sorry for the people in Char-

leston.”
y,

Where were you when

Hugo hit Davidson?

1. In bed, shivering in fright.
2. On Chambers’ lawn, trying to save

homeless squirrels.

3. Outside, screaming like a banshee, and
disturbing those who were sleeping.
4. You didn't heat‘a thing--“What hurri-

cane?”

5. Running to remove your car from
where you parked it near a tree.

Hugo to appear in court

By DOUG HICKS

The Honor Council was outraged
three weeks ago by the reckless behav-
ior of Hugo, an unwelcome visitor from
South Carolina.

Council Chairman D.J. Snell report-
edly issued a warrant for Hugo’s arrest,
but the Davidson College Police De-
partment, believing Hugo escaped to
the north through West Virginia, has
called its Cushman force off of the case.

Wasting little time in completing its
own forms of vandalism, such as knock-
ing over lampposts, Hugo then pro-
ceeded to pull out 200-year-old trees by
their roots.

Dean of Students Will Terry report-
edly said that not even the wildest fra-
ternity actions had resulted in uprooted
trees, though on occasion some had
tried to do so.

Various freshmen were less con-
cerned than the Honor Council. While
the Honor Council was plotting an
Honor Trial, some freshmen drunkenly
screamed, “Go Hugo!” It remains to be
seen whether the Honor Council will
bring these frosh to trial as accomplices.

In an unprecedented effort to appre-
henda hurricane, the Davidson College
(um, DAVIDSON) security force pa-

trolled all of Thursday night in their
fleet of top-of-the-line Cushman anti-
hurricane vehicles. But Hugo got away.

The visiting vandal from South Caro-
lina appeared to attack with specific
victims in mind: was it just coincidence
that the Rusk House, Terry’s house, and
college president Kuykendall’s house
all suffered significant damage from
fallen trees?

Some students speculated the follow-
ingas the hurricane’s motivation: Hugo
had earlier been rejected by a Ruskie for
being “too forceful’; that he had held a
grudge against the Dean of Students for
previous disciplinary action. Students
also guessed that Hugo had been angry
at Kuykendall for our 15-week (mara-
thon) semester system. These specula-
tions, however, remained uncon-
firmed.

Hugo’s presence managed to stir up
the campuseven more than the condom
controversy of this past spring. His
destructive dexterity dwarfed even the
recent performance of the Chinese
Golden Acrobats of Taipei. The ques-
tion remains of how to discipline a
storm the size of South Carolina. Snell

and company must face this ever-con-

troversial issue.

Two students ventured outside as Hugo madeits retreat early Friday, September 22.

Charleston is home for some students

By HEATH HARDAGE and
TRENT STEVENS

Davidson may seem far away
from Charleston, S.C., which Hur-
ricane Hugo totalled three weeks
ago, but for some students Char-
leston is very close to the heart.

“It’s really devastating because
that’s my homeland,” lamented
freshman Jennifer Holladay.

“It took so much of the history
away,” she said. “It’s hard to let go
of.”

Former Charlestonian McNair
Hughes was extremely happy that
she moved to Knoxville, Tennes-
see this past July. Her old house,
built in 1816, did suffer some
damage due to Hurricane Hugo.

“My room fell off the house!”
she said. “It’s sitting in my (for-
mer) neighbor’s front yard.” The
house’s roof was also blownaway.

Sophomore Kristine Booker’s
father has business interests in

Charleston. “All the doors were’

blown off his building and a fleet
-of 33 trucks were completely sub-
merged,” she said.

According to Holladay, many
Charlestonians are deeply linked
to the city by family ties, and are
saddened to witness the damage
to houses that once belonged to
relatives and are part of one’s his-
tory and roots.

Holladay hails from West Ash-

ley, ten minutes from hard-hit

downtown Charleston. Her
mother and younger sister left for
Chattanooga, Tennessee before

, the storm arrived. Fortunately, her

house was largely unharmed, but
the family’sbeach houseon thelsle
of Palms was swept away.

Unlike the many Charleston
area students who decided to stay
at Davidson after Hugo’s punch,
Holladay went home the Saturday
after the storm and returned the
next evening.

“All of the trees fell down,” she
said of her yard. “There was about
two feet of water in my car.I didn’t
open the door.”

the battered Charleston Battery.

“It’s really scary,” she said, of
her voyage into the heart of Char-
leston. “It gives youa really creepy
feeling knowing that there are
people patrolling the streets at
night. “

National Guardsmen have been
stationed in the city to help pre-
vent looting and to. enforce an
emergency curfew. Violators of
the curfew are given one warnifig
shot and are apprehended if they
don’t go home.

“Everybody in the city is afraid

of looting,” stated Holladay.

However, the city has been able
to start recovering with the help of
many volunteers.

“It wasamazing how much help

Charleston received from the out-
lying areas,” Holladay said. .

“Everybody’s just a big family,
especially in the historical dis-
trict.”

However, restoring Char-
leston’s face to what it was before
the storm will take “forever.”

“There's nothing you can do to
replace a tree that’s been there 200
years or a house that’s been there
150. Hopefully, now people will
stop, look around and feel the
beauty that’saround them instead
of taking it for granted.”

Had Charleston ‘taken Hugo’s
threat seriously?

Hughes’s brother, a student at
the College of Charleston, in-
formed her that “hurricane par-
ties” were held at the college.
Apparently, no one had antici-
pated the force of Hugo.

The attitude of the students, ac-

cording to Hughes, wassomewhat
skeptical: “Hugo, yeah

 right!... They never really thought

it was going to hit.”
Hughes's father, a minister, lost
his parish-the First Presbyterian

’ Church in Charleston. The church

had just been renovated, but the
hurricane caused the roof to cave
in and the steeple to fall off.

Sophomore Andrew Peery, also
of Charleston, reported that his
house on the Charleston Battery
escaped severe damage.

._ “Theroofis intact, and the house
didn’t leak.”

However, as of Tuesday, Peery
still did not know what had be-
come of his family’s beach house
onSullivan’sIsland.  ,

“National Guardsmen are kick-
ing everyone off right now,” he
said.

Yet another unpleasant side
effect of the hurricane, according
to Peery, is that “all the snakes are
coming out, so.no one can come
in!”

Junior Ford Shippey lives in
Mount Pleasant, a city near Char-
leston. His family evacuated safely
to Columbia, but Shippey stayed
at Davidson during the storm.

“I’m not going to go home,” he
said, “it would be crazy to goright
now because of the chaos.”

“I don’t want to sce it [Char-
Ieston] until it’s all fixed up,” he
added. “I don‘t want toadd to the
spectacle.”

Although Shippey’s house sur-

vived, he said that his neighbor--
hood “Nooked like a a bomb hit it.” ”

“It probably won’thit meuntil |
actually godown there,” he said of
the storm’s personal impact.

Freshman Julia Lake, also of
Mount Pleasant, was fortunate in
that nothing happened to her
house.

However, she added that “Eve-

-tybody’s dock is gone--shrimp,

Ba

Ps

”

crabs and mud are in everyone’ s
houses.”

Mount Pleasant has set a 7 p.m.
curfew, and according to Lake,
“Everyone obeys it.”

However, there is some evi-

- dence of lawlessness in the city.

“People are selling generators
for $700.00,” stated Lake.

Sophomore David Smythe lives
on Seabrook Island. His family
was evacuated to Santee, which is
70 mites inland.

“My house didn’t get a drop of
water; I was. psyched!” Smythe
declared. Nevertheless, of
Kiawah, a neighboring island, he
said “Kiawah is going to totally

. change. Ninety percent of the pine

trees on Kiawah were destroyed.”
Sophomore Derek Counts lives
on James Island, to the south of
Charleston. His father, a minister,
stayed in a Charleston church
during the storm, but the rest of his
family evacuated. Like the houses
of many Charleston area students,
his house was largely maceneaes,
except for ruined carpets.

Yak expected itto be worse thanit

was,” he related, noting that the

. outer barrier islandsblockedsome

of the worst of the storm’s impact.

When asked if any good came
outof the storm, he said, “We gota
free weekend. We didn’t have
classes on Friday. Other than that,

nothing I can think of.”
