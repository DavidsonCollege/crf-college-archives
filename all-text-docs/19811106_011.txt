One of the: most exciting new albums

to find their way. onto my turntable in
recent weeks has been the debut LP

by a group with the unlikely name of

Bow Wow Wow. This. group: is
brought to you by former punk en-
trepeneur Malcolm M‘Laren (the
same man who brought you the Sex
Pistols back in ’76). This time, how-
ever, M‘Laren has forsaken nihilis-
tic politics for tribal chants of un-
known: ethnic origin, a funky beat,

and the intriguing voice of a fifteen-
year-old girl.

This girl, whose name is never given
on the album, is at.first oddly remin-
iscent of Debra Harry or even a
spaced-out Olivia. Newton-John,
with a lyrical but detached. and airy
voice. Whén she begins talking in
the.declamatory ‘passages :of the
songs, however, you know this. pu-
bescent female is tough! While her
pleas may be impassioned, its a pass-
ion derived from sardonic humor and
sensual needs, and not from frustrat-
ed puppy love. Fortunately, this girl
gets. what she wants without stoop-
ing to the “macho chick” stance of
poseurs like Pat Benatar, to name
only the worst example of the nasty

women who mimic the juvenile silli-
ness of heavy metal singers. The girl

in Bow Wow Wow brings to her
. Songs a breathy urgency that rivets
‘the listener’s attention, but through

seduction, not force.

The ‘lead singer is very capably
backed up by the talents of the musi-
cians in Bow Wow Wow, including
the better drummer and guitarist
from Adam and the Ants. The drum-
mer keeps up a primal stomp
throughout the album, mixing com-

‘plex polyrhythms with the frenzy of

a voodoo Gris—Gris man.The guita-
rist borrows elements from the
soundtracks of Spaghetti Westerns
(remember The Good, The Bad, and
The Ugly?), while the bass player
tosses. in some tasteful thumb-

' —strumming into the final mix. The

band also grooves in very primitive-
—sounding chants, sounding like
modern Indian warriors with electri-
cal instruments:

Even if the vocals and intrumen-
tation weren’t as outstanding as they
are, the lyrics of the songs would
warrant attention. In keeping with
the musical themes of primal with
raw emotions, most of the songs are

set in some jungle setting or another.
Other songs have an underlying feel-
ing of violence, such as the woder-

fully abandoned “Elimination:Danc-

ing.” In “Hello, Hello Daddy (I'll
Sacrifice You),” they address incest
and your parent’s fear that you will
kill them (or that you’ll get older,
which is of course the same thing) in
a subtle but exotic manner. Perhaps
the best song on the LP is the bio-
graphical trance tune “Chihuahua,”
which is comprised of the best quali-
ty of the other songs on the record,
including archetypal chants, the

6

frantic approximation of a: dog’s

. barking, and the most arresting per-

formance by the lead singer (“. .
And the Greeks had a word for it
And it went like this/ Oh Chihuahua
Chihuahua Chihuahua”).

Overall, the Bow Wow Wow de-
but LP provides perfect music for
partying, dancing, or just listening in
awe. If this review has caught your
interest, do yourself and your stereo
a favor and go get this record by a
group which by all rights should: be
“the next big thing.” See you at the
record store.
