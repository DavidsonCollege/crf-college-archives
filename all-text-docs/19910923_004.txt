different even if they do happen to
be curious. Conway himself, likes
to tell people he considers himself
in no way a politically correct
person, so people will ask him
“what in the hell he’s about.”
Contact is the next phase. A
person in the contact phase is not
afraid to talth people about issues
that divide them. He or she would
have a meal with someone and not

worry about how he looks in such
asituation. Asa director of student
activities at Cornell, Conway has
observed that it is a bold step for
college students, and moreover a
crucial one.

Integration is the last phase.
Conway was quick to point out
that what he means by integration
is not the “cryin’, leanin’, ‘We-
are-the-World’- singin’” integra-
tion. He means instead that people,
as open thinkers, will seek new
challenges an opportunities to meet
new and different people. Most of

they are while maintaining a clear
sense of who they are.

Finally, he urged college stu-
dents, as future leaders, to remem-
ber one simple and important les-
son: respect the world of others.
By keeping that idea in mind, we
can hopefully remember the value
of tolerance and sensitivity to other
peoples and cultures.

office-retail store complex on
Highway 73 beside Knox Realty.
This complex is adjacent to the
Liverpool Project that is still in the
process of being developed.

‘ This new Liverpool area will
have a Best Western, a UCB bank,
office space, retail space, and an
eight screen movie theater. The

theater is expected to open later
this year probbaly around Novem-

ber.

Jennings said that there is still
a lot of room for future develop-
mentalong Highway 73, especially
after it is expanded to five lanes,
He said that he is trying to encour-
age mixed uses of this area with
some commercial and some living
space.

relax before the evening partying began, PAX
stepped in to provide a refreshing surprise for
the court.

No, PAX is not a fraternity, and any fresh-
men who thought that they had gotten an early
bid to a fraternity are in for a surprise. PAX is,
however, a house that has been converted to an
inter-fraternal dormitory.

One of the attractions at PAX was the debut
of Davidson’s newest band. Getting together
just for the evening’s celebration, the band
combines the musical talents of Julian Cochran,
Michael Thurman, Chip Petree, Chris Hove-
land, Peter Jackson, and Omar Ahsanuddin.

They played a delightful blend of the Dead,
the Allman Brothers, and Widespread Panic.

PAX kept things shaking until later in the
evening when Sig Ep hosted the court’s only
late-night event. The court sorely missed the
presence of PiKA and KA, who have both
been placed on a week’s probation by Dean
Terry for violating pledging regulations last
spring.

Sig Ep did, however, provide freshmen
with a view of what they’ve missed for the
past four weeks and what they can look for-
ward to for the next four years.

HOW WISC IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST OVERSEAS PROGRAMS:

¢ Accepted students receive admissions letters (and later transcripts) directly
from an Oxford (or Cambridge) college.

¢ Students are directly enrolled as full students of the Oxford college.

¢ Qualified early applicants may share a co-ed Student Residence associated
with St. Catherine's College, Oxford (fully integrated with British students).

¢ Students accepted before November | (for the Winter Term) or before May 1
(for next year) are guaranteed housing with British students.

¢ . Students will NOT be taught in (and receive transcripts from) an American
college operating in Oxford. WISC is one of the few completely integrated
(academically and in housing) overseas programs in the UK.

+ Previous students in your field will speak to you on the phone.
