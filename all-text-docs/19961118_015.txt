The men’s basketball team

of college graduates,” said head

coach Bob McKillop. “It certainly
exposed us in terms of what we
need to work on. But it also high-
lighted some of the things that
we’re capable of doing.”

Forward Narcisse Ewodo led
led all scorers with 27 points and
two-guard Mark Donnelly added
18 on 4-of-8 shooting from behind
the arc.

Freshman power forward
Landry Kosmalski sparkled in his
debut, tallying 14 points and 12
t

ping Fort Bragg, 74-63.

“Tt was a much better effort -

than last Saturday (a 70-59 loss to
the Smokey Mountain Swarm),”’
said head coach John Filar. “But
we have to get hungrier defen-
sively, we let up too many boards,

and we’ ve got to cut down on turn-
overs. Turnovers and boards are
going to be the two things we’re
really going to have to improve
upon.”

Center Jennie Vanlerberghe
led the Wildcats, notching 14 points
and grabbing 7 rebounds.

Rookie Katy Kamp tallied 13
points and Carolyn Kirsch and Jes-
sica Montrella each added adozen.

Kerry Brown made an auspi-
cious return from an ankle injury,
recording 8 points, 4 rebounds,
and 4 assists in 25 minutes.

While anyone could argue
about who has the best name, no
one can question’ the
Rugmunchers’, Wookies’, 2nd
Cannon’s, Taco Salad’s, and Base-
ment Belk Bureau’s claims to be-
ing the best teams in their respec-
tive sports.

Captained by Tripp Cherry
and composed mostly of sopho-
mores and their former hall coun-
selor Jonathan Coulombe from 3rd
West Belk last year, the
Rugmunchers completed arare feat
in flickerball. After winning the
freshman championship last year,
the guys decided to stick together
and go against the tougher compe-
tition in A league. They breezed
through the regular season and went
-indefeated in the playoffs, defeat-
ng Josh Becker’s independent
eam, BOB, 32-27, to claim their
second title.

The Wookies were champi-
yns of the freshmen halls.
captained by Scott Herr, 3rd East
lefeated 2nd Little in the champi-
mship game, 25-12. The big break-

hrough for them in the post season
ould have been against the regu-
ar season champions, the Beef
Curtains (3rd Little). After finish-
ng second in the regular season to
he Beef Curtains, the Wookies
iqueaked by them, 34-32, and then
sruised the rest of the way.

The women’s league could be
lescribed in one phrase: Smash
nouth football. Defense domi-
iated and points were scarce. In
he eleven games in the winner’s
sracket, the losing team never
scored a point. Only once did a
‘eam score more than 14 and that
was done by eventual champion,
2nd Cannon. Captained by
Susanne Tranguch, they went un-
lefeated in the regular season and

continued the trend through
postseason play. Kool and Gang,
captained by Emily Eagan, posed
the biggest challenge, but 2nd Can-
non, conquered them 13-0 in the
finals.

In 3-on-3 basketball Taco
Salad finished in third place dur-
ing the regular season. But, Will
Bradshaw, Bob Lonergan, Austin
Rutledge, Johnathan Sipling, and.
Trey Wilson stepped up their play,
taking out previously unbeaten
Gumbo twice in the playoffs. Taco
Salad got an early lead on Gumbo
in the championship and cruised to
a 21-13 win.

Inthe freshman league, it came
down totwo teams. Basement Belk -
Bureau and the Punching Clowns
both went undefeated in the regu-
lar season. But, the Bureau over-
came the Clowns inthe end. Patrick
Daymond, Chuck Haines, Mark
Jones, Travis Pritchett, and Aaron
Snethen won two close games
against the Clowns to become~™
champions of the freshmen halls.

Inthe inaugural tennis tourna-
ment, Brain Woodward and Anna
Fenton-Hathaway took the honors
in the men’s and women’s divi-
sions. Woodward dismissed Andy
Kazama 6-0, 6-0 in the champion-
ship match, but he almost did not
make it’ that far having to’ battle
past Ray Liguori 4-6, 7-5, 6-0 to
advance to the tournament finals.
Fenton-Hathaway had an easier
time, dropping just six games on
the way to the title, defeating
Michelle Markey 6-2 in the finals.

And Morgan Camp. took the
honors in the first racquetball tour-
nament ever. Camp defeated Ryan
Moore in the finals, 15-8,15-8, to
claim the championship. In addi-
tion, Jeff Waldman capped off an
impressive string of five victories
defeating Jack Morse, 15-6, 15-9,
in the finals of the consolation
bracket.
