Acting highlights
suspense thriller

By ROBERT BOWIE

Asst. Features Editor
Marathon Man is the sort of light,

let’s-make-a-buck suspense thriller
that constitutes the greater part of
American film-making. This pop film
is scheduled for 8 and 10:30 on
Saturday night in Love auditorium.

No one is going to come out of
Marathon Man praising a new film
masterpiece or composing epithets
about any profound existential —
sociological--‘‘whatever’’ meaning.

But no one will want their money
back either.

And a good many will probably be
saying: ‘“‘That guy Dustin Hoffman’s
pretty good, isn’t he?”’

‘‘Lawrence Olivier, the English
chap who sells all the cameras, he
almost makes you think he actually
swallowed that diamond...Roy
Schneider, he was in jaws, too, wasn’t
he?”’

As you might have gathered, the
acting is one of the most impressive
things about Marathon Man and the
actors frequently save the film from

In music, 1977 will always be
remembered for the death of Elvis
Presley, the fountainhead of Rock 'n
Roll.

Beyond that, 1977 was character-
ized by the continued resurgence of
those sixties artists who hung in
there--Fleetwood Mac, Steve Miller
Boz Scaggs, and Bob Seger.

Their return was often spectacular.

Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours sold
over eight million copies and is still
selling 200,000 copies weekly, lending
strong support to the theory that all
the unsucessful, yet admirable, ar-
tists of the Sixties are succeeding in
the late Seventies.

While the success of those Sixties
artists may rest on the smoothness,
the professional slickness of their
sound, the other major movement in
Rock, } Rock, is based on their

getting too hokey or unbelievable for
the viewer to stand.

Director John Schlesinger doesn't
grind one’s nerves as effectively as,
say, Brian DePalma’s Carrie or
Richard Brooks’ Looking for Mr.
Goodbar, but Schlesinger does man-
age to keep the fast pace necessary for
the William Goldman screenplay to
hold together.and also hold the
viewer's interest,

I have heard some people complain
about the violence in Marathon Man
and although I didn’t find it partic-
ularly revolting or even exciting,
there’s one scene that may give you a
bit too vivid memory of your last
toothache.

By the way, in case you're wonder-
ing why I haven't mentioned any-
thing about the plot, I’m a firm
believer that all thrillers should be
taken cold-turkey in order to be
enjoyed fully.

Suffice it to say that everyone is
out to get Dustin Hoffman and the
ae parts of the film are out to get

exact antithesis.

Punk Rock is fast, loud and, most
of all, vicious. Punk is to mainstream
Rock what the Rolling Stones were to
the Beatles in the early Sixties--Out-
siders, The Bad Boys your parents
didn’t like.

In the Seventies, Rock has become
acceptable. It is in the mainstream.

Punk moves back to a Rock ’n Roll
that is ‘‘on the fringe.”

Album sales continued to rise even
with $7.98 list price taken up by some
manufacturers. What is discouraging
is that so many excellent albums
simply not selling well.

Here then is a list of those albums

people neglected in their mania for
Fleetwood Mac. Pick one up and you
may be pleasantly surprised.
1. Elvis Costello My Aim is True

and sounds like Buddy Holly gone
sour on humanity.

7/8 most underrated albums listed

Paranoid music for a paranoid
decade.

2. Cheap Trick In Color Melodic
hard rock that sounds like early The
Who and late Beatles combined into a
fresh and vital sound.

3. Meat Loaf Bat Out of Hell a
Bruce Springsteen-like collection of
teen anthems.

There is wonderful orchestration by
the man who brought you the Rocky
Horror Show.

4. Animals Before We Were So
Rudely Interrupted This is a reunion
albvm that works.

The Animals return to the blues
based rock they played so well.

5. Van Morrison A Period of
Transition Morrison's last few albums

have been mediocre and this is a
comeback of sorts.

This is not his best music, but not
one can sing like Van Morrison.

6. Alpha Band Spark in the Dark
this is the group that backed Bob
Dylan on his Rolling Thunder tour.

Their music is a weird amalgama-
tion of country-rock, Lou Reed and
mysticism, yet it is extremely haunt-
ing and melodic.

7. Klaatu Hope. No, they are not
The Beatles this is still good music in
its own right, this kind of music the
Electric Light Orchestra should be
making.

Bring back the Cat!

‘ [Continued from page 11]

ters of King Clock, Nine A. Clock and
Eight A. Clock.

King Trosston pitches a ‘‘royal fit”’
when he discovers that his youngest
son wishes to wed a cat. Blanchette
reveals that the spell cast upon her
can be broken, if the members of the
entire ‘‘royal court’’ will cover their
eyes. and count to seven, increasing
their voices in volume, with each
number.

The Purple Fairy arrives, to say
that one hundred voices must parti-
cipate to break the spell. What
follows is a thilling climax.

The Lord Most Helpful rises to the
occasion by enlisting the support of
the children in the audience. The

Purple Fairy laughs hysterically, '

saying that all those children will
never keep their eyes shut. He was
wrong. However, L kept my eyes
open, to see what was happening.

When thesprineess failed to be
transfurmucu iom@the white cat: inie
her old self, Treeble looked me square

in the eyes and told me to close mine
also, or the spell would not be broken.

I complied with this ‘“‘royal de-
mand,’’ and after counting seven, |
opened my eyes to see the restored
princess in all her ‘‘royal splendor.”

The king could not bring himself to
pass on his kingdom to only one of the
princes, but Princess Blanchette
brought a happy ending to this
enchanted performance. Being herself
the heir to the enchanted Two
Kingdoms of Katzholm, she offered
them to the other two princes.

In closing, the Purple Fairy, in
Wizard of Oz fashion, disappeared
from the scene. His end was caused
not by a bucket of water, but by a bite
on the nose from ‘'the most beautiful
little dog in the world,”’ the only thing
to which he was vulnerable.

Truly, Mr. Barber has created a
performance which should become a
yearly production. Like The Three
Bears, Jack and the Beanstalk, and
raans“of Andy Griffin, xne White
Cat can never grow tiresome.
