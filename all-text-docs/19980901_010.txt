Dave Matthews Band electrifies the Creek

Ensemble extraordinaire plays both “old” and “new Dave”’

By WEsLEY H. GoLDsBERRY
Arts & Living Editor

Saturday night paid witness to the penultimate
gig on the Dave Matthews Band’s summer calen-
dar, the first of two consecutive nightly shows at
the hallowed
Walnut Creek
Amphitheater
in Raleigh.
The Triangle
area’s most
prominent
concert venue,
“the “Creek”
has played
host to every-
one from
Aerosmith to
Peter, Paul, &
Mary since its
construction in
the early
1990s.

For sev-
eral Davidson
students, the @
two-and-a-
half-hour interstate voyage to the capital city was
not enough to keep them from attending Saturday
evening’s concert, which had been sold out for a
few weeks.

The first spectators began filtering into the
sweltering amphitheater shortly after 5:30 p.m.,
eager to grab their favorite portion of lawn. Soon
thereafter, hundreds of khakied college students
dotted the landscape. “Truly, an awesome spec-

‘ tacle,” it was said.

, At 7:15 p.m., the opening band took the stage
in the form of The Getaway People, and not the
Barenaked Ladies.as many had hoped or even
anticipated. :

, The Getaway People hailed from Norway,
and harbored a grunge element in their repertoire
which didn’t seem quite the DMB’s style, but was
surprisingly palatable nonetheless. They jammed
or until shortly before sunset, at which point the
crowd was approaching an air-tight ‘capacity of
around 20,000 people.

The Dave Matthews Band

Mr. Matthews and his band of minstrels as-
sumed the stage at 8:19 p.m. EDT, receiving a
riotous ovation as the opening strains of “Seek
Up” sounded from the strings of Dave’s Gibson.
The intro seemed to last forever, setting the trend
for an evening of songs which were long enough to
make one
mumble,
“T’d like to
hear a new
song now,
please —
this cen-
tury,” be-
fore the
band would
move into a
new one. At
least this
kept the
crowd
seething
with antici-
pation
throughout
the whole
muggy af-
fair.

The band proceeded with a triumvirate of
“favorites” from their latest (and oft-maligned)
album, which included “Rapunzel,” “Stay,” and
“The Stone.” “Stay” was by far the most well-
received of the three.

There was an unspoken affinity in the crowd
during this song, an aggregate sigh of relief that

Dave had left his background singers at home. .

Woo hoo! This helped bring the guitar part to the
work’s forefront, whose syncopated strumming
yielded 20.000 pairs of jubilant dancing feet.
“Rapunzel,” with its incessant repetition of trite
blues and jazz motifs, was just as annoying in
person as it is on the album. The melodic line in
“The Stone” strongly implies an underlying chord
progression, but there was no discernable har-
monic foundation anywhere in the first verse —
just Boyd Tinsley playing parallel fifths seem-

“ingly at random on his fiddle._You could feel the

crowd becoming antsy, pining away for the “Re-
member Two Things” era.

Fortunately, the band busted out with an
energetic rendition of “Drive In Drive Out,” fol-
lowed by “Lie In Our Graves,” which featured a
pretty good fiddle solo from Tinsley, although he
still proudly boasts: his middle-school-orchestra-
caliber vibrato.

Then came “Don’t Drink the Water,” which
sounded exactly the same live. ~

“But did they play ‘Two Step?’” (Hang ona
minute, Ill get there.) After singing “Happy
Birthday” to Michael McDonald, road manager of
the Dave Matthews Band, Dave broke into the
familiar janglings of “Crash” (also known as
“Variations on an E Major Triad”) which took
everyone by surprise. Remember that one? Al-
though colossally overplayed back in ’96-’97, the
crowd cheered in uniform approval — proof that
we still enjoy hearing the thing.

The
most confus-
ing number
on the night
was “The
Last Stop,”
Dave’s most
prominent
venture in
quasi-Arabic
music com-
position. I
was con-
founded: by
Boyd
Tinsley’s
harmoniza-
tion on the
last chord. of
the song (a
tonic chordin
F# major),
over which he
played an E
descendingto
aD, repeating
the pattern nearly adozen times. Failing to resolve
his D down toa C#, his harmonization was absurd
and_just_plain_wrong,-even-considering-that-the
piece was written in double harmonic mode. I still
wonder what on earth Boyd was thinking.

These shenanigans were followed by the not-
so-well-known “Granny” and the ever popular
“Dancing Nancies,” which drove the crowd abso-
lutely nuts. The main portion of the show closed
out with a lenthy version of “Warehouse,” one
very similar to that from the band’s live album,
released last fall.

“But did they play ‘Two Step?’”

To answer the question that we’ve all been
waiting for: No, they didn’t play “Two Step.” I
know, it made me mad too.

Dave did play two encores, however, includ-
ing perennial favorites “So Much To Say,” with a
segue into “Too Much,” and “Tripping Billies,”
which drove everyone into an unbridled frenzy.
The band left the stage at 10:35 p.m., not to return
until the following evening.

As expected, Saturday night’s concert was

=

one big orgasmic fury of guitar, sax, drums, and
fiddle. Despite harmonic eccentricities in a few of
Dave’sPhrygianinfluenced works, he and his quar-
tet of seasoned performers put on an outstanding
show. It was, dare I say, epic.
