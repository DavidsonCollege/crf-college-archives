Provision

regulations on the Wildcat

Handbook

The Senate discussed an
amendment to allow msing
juniors and semors to run for
SGA President and Vice-
President. According to SGA
President Bo Phillips. a num-
ber of schools are opening up
the presidency to students other
than those in the msing semor
class The basic idea 1s to open
up the potential for more in-

volvement in the student
government —
Senator Rick Damewood

proposed an amendment
specifying that the president
and vice-president would be
eligible for re-election.

Another amendment was
proposed by Doug Sittler. Sit-
uer suggested that candidates
be allowed to run as teams for
the SGA presidency ‘This
opens up more options to the
student body. Sittler said.
Because Sittler introduced a
motion to table the amend-
ments unti) the next meeting.
the Senate took no action on the

proposals

The Senate also discussed
amendments to the Bylaws con-
cerning the Unien Board and
the Social Council

Also in Tuesday night's
meeting. Blain Butner was
nominated to a position on the
Governance Committee

Steve Dodd reported to the
Senate from the Educational
Planning Committee Ac-
cording to Dodd. the committee
will make changes in the first
part of the course catalog
Dodd also said that there will be
changes made in Spanish
requirements

several] seniors were interested
in the position. and felt that any
one of them could have done a
Bood job

“Rich's fine qualifications,
including his experience on the
student newspaper and the
Governance Committee, should
make him a very capable suc-
cessor to Duff Bruce. who has
neld the job during 1972-73,"
Spencer added.

The president complimented
Bruce on his ‘excellent work."
For several vears Spencer has
emploved recently-graduated
students to serve a year as his
assistant. “‘I feel very fortunate
in having had a succession of
outstanding assistants.”’ he
said

As assistant to the president
Wilson will be responsible for
assisting in relationships with
trustees as well as other cam-
pus matters.

“I think the office of assistant
to the president is the primary
link to the president and other
members of the college com-
munity. commented Wilson

“T think it will give me a dif-
ferent view of the college ad-
ministration than I've had in
the past,” said Wilson

“One of the special con-
tributions a person in this job
can make is serving as a bridge
between students and this of-
fice,’ Spencer added.

Grievance Committee
Faces Student Apathy

By BILL LLOYD
Staff Writer

The Davidson College
Grievance Committee,
designed to give the students a
“sounding board” to air their
gripes has received few student
complaints.

The committee was set up by
the SGA to * ‘attack the red tape
that exists among the groups of
the Davidson College com-
munity,’ according to com-
mittee member Vince Rabil.

“The lack of response could
be an indication that the stu-
dents are satisfied with the way
things are being run,”’ Rabil
said.

The committee has been in
existence for only three weeks
this year. It was designed last
year by the SGA to help stu-
dents with complaints concern-

ing such things as eating houses.

residence halls, administration,
faculty and college services

“The Grievance Committee
was organized as an added
source of input to the Student
Government Association,”
Rabil said.

Another possible reason for
the lack of participation ac
cording to Rabil is. that
people aren't interested in
going to the trouble of com
plaining so close to the end of
the vear

Suggestions and complaints
registered thus far this vear in-
clude the Davidson College
catalog. It is felt by some
students that the catalog is
unrealistic. An example cited
by Rabil is the price of books for
students.

“According to the catalog the
book fees run around $90. This
sum can be equalled easily just
by the books of the first year
Humanities,"* he remarked

The football program and
various recruiting tactics were
also mentioned as previous
gripes

“In order for the Grievance
Committee to be of any value to
the students’ appreciation must
increase. It is committee policy
that all grievances are kept con-
fidential,”’ Rabil said

Persons wishing to submit a
problem could do so at the
Meetings or just give them to a
committee member when con-
vement

The Grievance Committee
will meet every Monday mght
this term from 7 pm. to 7:30
Pm in Cunmngham meeting
