Students Favor Optional Laundry

By PAUL WELCH
Staff Writer

The results of a Tuesday’s
Sena referendum
on four issues of college policy
indicate a strong student
desire for major change .

The issues considered were
the future of the college laun-
dry, the yearbook, the present
P.E. requirement, and the
desireability of an evening
exam period.

The questions asked on the
referendum sheets were
drawn up by four separate
Senate committees, each of
which is currently studying
one of the above-mentioned
areas.

General information con-
cerning each of these areas
was distributed among the
student body in the form of
fact sheets before the polls
opened in order that the
students might make more in-
formed choices.

One result of this advance
information may be seen in
the fact the nearly 500 studen-
ts were polled. This is an
unusually high total for a
referendum of this tyype.

The results reveal that 92
percent of the students polled
are against total abolition of
the college laundry service. A
3 to 1 majority would like to
continue to use the laundry’s
sheet and shirt services, while
only 40 percent said they
would use it for all cleaning
needs.

However, 80 percent of the
students responded favorably
to eliminating the mandatory

laundry fee. Approximately
the same number favored the
installation of washing
machines in the dormitories.
The referendum section on
the future of Quips and Cranks
was included to provide the
yearbook staff and funding
authorities with feed-back on
students’ interests and
opinions. Most students in-
dicated that they felt funding
for this publication from their
fees should remain within the
range of $8 to $12 per person.

Respondees were evenly
divided on the question of
whether the book should come
out in the spring or the fall, but
were overwhelmingly in favor
of retention of the present
system of ‘‘candid’’ senior pic-
tures.

Apparently, students also
approve of the present system
under which Quips and
Cranks, THE DAVIDSONIAN,
and The Wildcat Handbook
are published separately.
They voted to retain this
system rather than adopt the
publication of a ‘combined

Multi-volume’’, containing all
three.
They voted 410 to 59 to retain

this system rather than adopt
the publication of a ‘‘com-
bined Multi-volume’’, con-
taining all three.

Most of the students polled
also favored the inclusion of at
least a few pages of color in
future yearbooks, as well as
more coverage of extra
curriculars and the addition o!
more candid shots of campus
and student life.

‘I can indicate that to date

“I am at present in the

results of their efforts.
