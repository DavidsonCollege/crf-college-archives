Freshman Financial Aid

Not To Meet Total Need

Director of Admissions and
Financial Aid H. Edmunds
White revealed this week that
Davidson College will no
longer be able to meet the
financial needs ®f all the in

coming freshmen.
“We will continue to offer
aid equal to the need of the

great majority of our stu-
dents; however, in the case
of some accepted applicants,
the college does not have the
financial resources to meet
their total need,’ said White.

“Tn such cases we shall of

Housing Lottery Delayed
By Administration Order

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Asst. Managing Editor
Director of Student, Housing
Scottie Nicholls says she
is falling further behind in
her yearly tasks every day
because the administration
is delaying authorizing the
selection of students to live
off-campus next year,

Over the years Nicholls

the most efficient way of do
ing her work, and every day
the room drawing is not held
that plan is delayed longer
and her problems are com-
pounded.

As a result of an order
from Vice President for Aca-
demic Affairs, Dr. John M.
Bevan, the drawing was
postponed from the original
plan for this week.

To avoid trouble and mix-
ups after the drawings, Nich-
olls delayed the lottery until

after permissions’ for off
campus living have been
granted,

‘Otherwise we might have
people switching roommates
and changing their plans,”
Nicholls Said; and that would
further complicate the proc-
eSS.

Nicholls and Dean of Stu-
dents Will H. Terry are re-
sponsible for reviewing and
granting requests for permis-
sion to live off-campus dur
ing the senior year.

When asked why. she-felt
there was a delay this year,
Nicholls said that undoubt
edly the main problem was
money. The administration
wants to allow for maximum
possible occupancy of dormi-
tory space to obtain maxi-
mum revenue.

She said the administra-
tion was probably also wait-
ing until th¢y had some idea
of how many freshmen would
be coming next year.

The drawings for order in
choosing rooms for next year
are presently planned for tne
second week of May. At least
two weeks are usually need-
ed to complete the opera-
tion. :

Nicholls said that if the
drawing were not held then,
the room selection process
might be. forced into the
summer months.

April 24 Offensive

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editer

The ‘Davidson Peace Coali-
tion has decided to throw ‘its
weight behind April 24 as the
important date in the spring
offensive to end the Vietnam
War.

“There are many reasons,’
said junior Mark Meza,
spokesman for the —group,
“but one. of the strengths of
April 24 over May 1 lies in
its legitimacy. This split over
dates is nationwide, and we

White noted that the col-

scholarships, loans and jobs

plicants.

White also said that much
of the financial aid for in
coming freshmen will be in
the form of loans and work
study.

“Despite the fact that the
college is increasing the
money it is putting into schol-
arships, costs’ have increas-
ed, more people are applying
for scholarships, and the av-
erage need of each applicant
has increased,"’ said Sterling.

“The applicants with strong
qualifications will hAve all

‘But the small group of in

rate as high as the others
will have to turn to. state
