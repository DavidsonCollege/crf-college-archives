Dr. Lawrence Silverberg, a
member of the Charlotte
Family Practice Clinic and
one of several new doctors at
the infirmary, is in Charlotte,
“primarily because of geogra-
phy.”

“I’m from Miami and my
wife is from New York. We
just pulled out the map and
picked a spot in the middle,
which happened to be here,”’
he explained, not quite seri-

Polo Cats
splash big

By KEVIN ROBBINS

The big news on the Club
Sports front is the splashing
resurgence of the Water Polo
Club, an 11-4 loser in their
lifetime first-ever match.
Battling the same Appala-
chian State team that was
responsible for the opening
loss one week earlier, the
Wetcats made the Unhappy
Apps look fish out of water in
a convincing 12-5 thrashing.
The Cats pooled their ta-
lents and displayed new fi-
nesse as the tricky ballhand-
ling of Jonathan Washburn
and Mark Tommerdahl and
the sensational goalkeeping of
Kirk ‘‘Blondbeard’’ Williams
opened up a 9-0 halftime lead.
The Clubbers easily held on
for the win over the frustrated
but outmanned Mountaineers.
The Gridiron Club team
went 1-1 the last two weeks,
losing to Baptist University of
America (you heard it right)
14-12, then coming back to
destroy Clemson 19-7.
Despite the addition of same
halftime soul, the Cats could
not get their act together in a
circus performance with BUA,
a first-year University.

Silverberg got his present
job by ‘‘walking into the
Family Clinic and leaving my
telephone number.’’ He has
run a neighborhood health
center in Charlotte as part of
the clinic’s work for the last
four months.

The neighborhood: clinic is
“‘an attempt’ at achieving
decentralized medical care by
having a center in the area to

but funding for his own
project runs out this year and
there is some possibility that
it will not be renewed.

Prior to this he worked on a
Nevada Indian Reservation,
as a public health officer in
Greenich Village, and as chief
physician of the Tombs prison
in New York City, where
3,000 inmated were crammed

into a facility designed for
1,000.

State’s only osteopath joins college infirmary

to be licensed in North Caroli-
na.

Osteopaths, he feels, are
more behaviorally oriented
than M.D.s, emphasizing the
whole person as patient and
not looking at isolated organ
disease, resulting in a more
holistic approach.

There are no ostepathic
schools in North Carolina,
emphasizing the difference be-
tween medical doctors and

complex in general on the part
of osteopaths,” he conceded,
but he feels philosophical
differences between the two
schools are becoming ob-
scured and that only political
differences remain.

While it is possible for
osteopaths to obtain dual
memberships, he is against
doing so because, ‘‘it takes

give primary care.’’ Silver-
berg sees this concept as
“taking off in this country.”

Silverberg is an osteopathic
doctor, the first, he believes,

osteopathic doctors.

As your Dean of Beer, it is my scholarly
opinion that just knowing the one word for
beer is not enough. You must also know the
reasons why. Because only then will I,
Siglinda Steinfiiller, be satisfied that you have
graduated from Remedial Beer Drinking.

QUESTIONS:

Q: 1. The best water for beer comes from:
a) Big Duck Mountain.
b) Underground from Tijuana.
c) A small store in Macon, Ga.
d) None of the above

A: (d) No matter what you hear about
“naturally pure” waters, virtually all
brewers filter and further purify their
water. But Schlitz doesn’t stop there. They
filter their water and then filter it again.
So when they’re through, it’s purer than
the purest springwater.

Q: 2. Klages and Firlbeck III are:

a) Composers of famous beer drinking
songs like “I Left My Shoes in Heidelberg”
b) Owners of the world’s largest unknown
brewery.

c) Serving time in Sonoma, Calif., for
impersonating Arnold the Wonder Seal.
d) More expensive barleys.

A: (d) Schlitz blends Klages and Firlbeck III
barleys with the standard variety most
brewers use because they believe it gives
their beer superior flavor.

Q:

3. Hops are notorious for:

a) Their lack of intelligence.
b) Always getting to work late.
c) Losing their keys.

d) Being difficult to keep fresh.

: (d) The freshest hops make the best beer.

That's why Schlitz Ait SH ated and
refrigerates their hops. So they're as fresh

at brewing time as they are at harvest time.

: 4. The best adjunct to beer is:

a) Rice.
b) Corn.
c) Either rice or corn.
d) What's an adjunct?

(c) Every American brewer uses rice or

corn to lighten the flavor of their beer.
This is called an adjunct. But Schlitz
knows how to use either grain inter-
changeably. So they’re never at the mercy
of an unfavorable crop. And neither is the
taste of their beer.

Q: 5. The biggest misconception about yeast

: (d) To make beer taste right consistently,’

: 6. Chill-Lagering is:

: (d) When Schlitz ages beer, they age it

: 7. A mini-brewery is:

a) Carrying some in your pocket is good
luck.

b) It is good for hernias.

c) It was responsible for the fall of the
Roman Empire.

d) To ferment beer, all you have to do is
drop it in the vat.

Schlitz believes the yeast has to be evenly

distributed during fermentation. That's

why Schlitz eerily stirs in their yeast. It’s

part of their Balanced Fermentation
process. And they’re the only American
rewer who does it.

a) A popular German country and western}
singer.

b) A Scandinavian winter sport played
without clothes.

c). A new ethnic TV comedy about the
