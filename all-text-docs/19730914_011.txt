Booters Open Season
Filled With Optimism

By JORDAN CLARK
Staff Writer

Davidson soccer appears to
be entering the new season ar-
med with enthusiams through-
out its ranks.

The Cat Booters host Guilford
Tuesday in their first match un-
der new head coach Chip Stone

Although five starters have
been lost off last year’s 7-5
team, Stone is decidedly op-
timistic about prospects for the
coming season.

“Of course, we won't know
until] we’ve seen ourselves.”
said Stone. ‘‘But I think we'll be
a good team.”’

The depth of the team and the
enthusiasm of the players are
certainly reason enough for
such an outlook. But Stone also
points to a new strategy he is
eager to try out

“Whereas our opponents will
probably run in the traditional!
four-three-three zone, a con-
servative approach which lacks
a great strength as well as a
great weakness,’’ commented
Stone, ‘we'll probably use a
twotfourfour setup This is a
much more liberal approach,
one where we feel we'll be
stronger both offensively and
defemmively With eight men in
midfield, we should be able to
control the ball "’

The team now carries 6
players, including « sound tur-
nout of freshmen Co-captains
elected last week are Donny
Kain and ‘Tom Tournee

Stone looks to Duke as the big
game of the year, saying
“We've never beaten them, but
this should be a good game.”

Teams such as Duke.
Carolina, and State, which have
106 and 15 scholarshipped
players will be running into a
tough group of Cats With no
weholarships available, David-

burdened by the thought of
