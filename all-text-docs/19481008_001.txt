It has been reported that a large
group of freshmen descended on the
corner. Incidentally this is the in-
tersection of the main street

They cut in front of several upper-
classmen. who had waiting
for a ride, and all congregated on
the corner. This large crowd right
on the highway generally fouled up
things for all congerned, No motor-
ist is going to §top for a crowd of

the corner. Other reports of

The rule is that all newcomers
on the corner should stand well
back on the sidewalk and wait for
the group on the corner to catch
the first-ride before the second
group starts bumming. If a student
doesn't want to wait on the corner,
he should go down the street tow-
ards Hugo's and bum there. No one
ever goes up the street!

tion was not relieved, he

BEGUN DURING

Since 1946, Mr. Charles F, Gil-
lette, landscape architect of Rich-
mond, Virginia, has been employed
by the College to draft-plans for the
development and beautification of
the campus, and as most everybody
has noticed, some of the landseap-
ing has already been accomplishecd.
One of the first projects undertak-
feet the
area on the north side of Chambers

was sown in part of this area dur-
ing the past summer. Also, some of
the Cham-
bers, being too Jarge in proportion
to the size of the building, was
transplanted to other sites on the

shrubbery surrounding

campus. These things plus the re-
moval of three old buildings, com-
pletes fhe work done on the campus
thus far.

However, during Mr. Gillette’s re-
cent visit to the college he outlined
to the administration more exten-
sive projécts, which, it is hoped, will
get near future.
Perhaps, the subject of more dero-
gatory than anything
concerning the campus-at-the

underway in the
comments

present time, is the inconvenience
of the present system of walks, or
even worse, the lack of walks else-
where throughout the campus. As
a result, one of the first things in-

SUMMER

cluded in Mr. Gillette’s plans to be
undertaken in the next few months
will be the bujjding of a more ser-
viceable “and danvenient system of
walks. These will include a network
of walks between Dormitory Row

and Chambers, a walk — extending

west from the south corner of

Chambers to main street, walk

and a walk extending from Dormi-

from
to

Another thing, which it is hoped

ternity Court. Most of this work

supposed to have been done
this past summer, but, because the
contractor has been delayed in an-
other city these projects have had to
be postponed for a short time.

The detailS mentioned above are
only a part of Mr. Gillette's long
range plan for the beautification of
our campus. But they will give you
some notion of what he 4s. planning
to have done. The blueprint calls
for many more radical-changes~ of
roads and walks, and more exten-
sive landscaping. Let's hope that it
won't be too long until 'we can say
with assurance and pride that we
have one of the most beautiful col-
