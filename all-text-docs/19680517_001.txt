The News And Editorial Voice Of The Davidson College Student Body

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C. 28036, FRIDAY, MAY 17, 1968

NEEDED: MORE DREAM

{IN

Blue Sky “Only The Start’

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Managing Editor

When the Southern Associa-
tion of Colleges and Universi-
‘ties examined Davidson in
1966, the prescription was
“some dreaming.”

Blue Sky was the result.
but only the start, according
to philosophy professor Earl
MacCormac.

Describing Davidson as “‘a
very good institution, but...
not excellent." MaeCormac
forecast an evolution of the
college in the direction of
more independent study, but
said: that. this direction of
change requires more emo-
tional maturity on the part
.of students.

An_ engineering major at
Yale who ended up in philoso-
phy. MacCormac has been
one, of the main spokesmen
for the progressive sector of
the faculty and a thorn in

Trustees’ Agenda,
Date Still Pending

By ROBBIE HOOKER
Editor-In-Chief

Neither the date nor the
agenda of the special meet-
ing of the Board of Trustees
has yet been decided, Chair-
man Walter. L, Lingle Jr. said
this week.

Lingle did say, however.
that the meeting, decided on
two weeks ago by the board
when it postponed action on
two decisions. would defin-
itely not be held until after
school is over May 30.

What is on the agenda will
be determined in part by
what happens between now
and then in the search for a
new president and what

Honor

Goes To

Martin

Dr. D. Grier Martin was
made an honorary member of
the Davidson chapter. of Delta
Phi Alpha, the national Ger-
man honor society, today
during chapel period. The
short ceremony took place in
Chambers.

Paul C. Fisher, faculty ad-
viser of the organization, said
that the honorary member-
ship was given to Martin in
order ‘‘to recognize the inter-
est that he has shown
throughout his tenure in the
study of modern languages,
particularly in the junior year
abroad program."

Fisher also credited Martin
for ‘being partly responsible
for establishing a permanent
German seminar room.

The society will present a
collection of ‘the works of
Frederich Schiller for the
German seminar room in the
name of Martin.

comes out of a detailed study
of the report of the Commit-
tee on Rules and Punishments
(CRAP), he said.

The CRAP Report will be
on the agenda. Lingle said in
a telephone interview from
Cincinnati, Ohio, if a legal re-
view of the judiciary section
has been completed.

The trustees took no action
on the report at their spring
meeting when questions about
its compatibility with state
laws were raised. Board
members also said they want-
ed more time to study the
final version of the report.

Lingle said that ‘‘one of
the better (legal) firms in
North Carolina,”” had under-
taken a study of the report,
“but how long it will take we
just don't know.”

A resolution docketed two
weeks ago that would elimin-
ate the present trustee re-
quirement that the president
of the college be a member.
of the Presbyterian Church
when elected may also be on
the agenda, Lingle said.

But he left open the possi-

bility thatthe 4-man trustee .

selection committee of which
he is chairman might have a
successor to D. Grier Martin
picked by the time of the
meeting.

“There's always the chance
that we will have the presi-
dency to vote on (at the spe--
cial meeting). he said. ‘’But
there's a lot of work to be
done before that can be de-
termined.

“It will probably be an-
other three or four weeks be-
fore we'll know.”

Lingle indicated that the
board would probably name
an’ interim president in the
event that it has not decided
on a new president by June
30. when Martin officially
steps down.

The last time the trustees

were deliberating over a new .

president—1958—they named
Dean of Faculty C. J. Pieten-
pol acting president until the
15-month search was com-
pleted.

The date of a special meet-
ing of the trustees is decided
by the chairman, after con-
sultation with other members
of the board. Lingle said. A

special meeting has to have

a stated agenda and can only
be called with 10 days notice,
he said.

the side of an often earth-
bound administration.

In the words but not the
manner of an _ enthusiastic
preacher — he’s sometimes
compared to Minnesota Sena-
tor Eugene McCarthy — he
demands “a passionate com-
mitment to the truth and to
the moral and spiritual re-
newal of society’’ from .all
eonnected with the college.

MacCormac singled out the
decline in applicants and the
foot-dragging on the Honors
College and Non-Western
Studies Program as especially
crucial.

Applications have dropped
300 over two years, he said,
and the percentage of accep-
tances is near an all-time low.

Because the ability of the
college to upgrade its cur-
riculum depends on the ma-

turity and ability of the stu-'

dents, reasoned MacCormac,
and the college is not attract-
ing these students, the college
should rethink its admissions
policy.

Both the Honors College for
its enlivening effect and the
Non-Western Studies program

‘for the broadening it gener-

ates are essential to the Blue
Sky concept, he maintained.

MacCormac noted that lit-
tle progress was apparent on
implementation of both pro-
grams, attributed it to the
current changes in process in
the college administration,
and then expressed fear that
inertia would prevail.

Asked to do some dreaming
about what.an ideal. program
of liberal arts education
would be, MacCormac first
pointed out that no one sys-
tem would be the best. and
then suggested that students
should have more indepen-
dent study.

“I'd provide a period of
exploration at the start." he
mused. The freshmen would
spend their year investigating
various outlooks and learning
through tutorials, but not tak-
ing courses.

“Students do not appreciate

a field until they take a
course in it, and then it’s too
Jate.”"

MacCormac suggested a
second year of independent
reading and study for area
exams, with lab and course
work in the general area of
concentration.

The junior vear would have
increased concentration in
the major, while the senior
year would be a research pro-
ject in that area.

In the midst of all this
would be several ‘‘convoca-
tions” a year — five or 10
days of concentrated ex-

posure of. the entire college-

problem, interrupting the
normal pattern of the col-
lege.

the role of the body. with its
contributions to areas from
sexuality to intellectual in-
sight, or the consequences of
the car on modern life.

To have this program, Mac
Cormac postulated a com.
munal emotional security, a
commitment to the process of
education, and maturity on
the part of students. ‘Stu.
dents should prod professors
to new thoughts and profes-
sors enlighten students with
depth.of learning and wisdom
of time,” he said.

When: asked about the
presidency of the college.
MacCormac said that the
next president must. be one
who is concerned with the
pursuit of truth. academic
freedom and educational qua-
lity.

ACP Lauds Paper:
You Write Like Pros

“You guys write like pros. Your entry blank .
says you have no. adviser, that none of you get
paid—and that Davidson has no journalism
courses. You are a threat to journalism educa- °

tors.”

So said the Associated Collegiate Press in
giving THE DAVIDSONIAN its 12th straight All-
American Award, the highest rating possible.

The award was for the first semester of 1967-
88, under the editorship of Sam Boyte. The news-
paper received 3890 points out of a possible 4000. ‘

_ The most heavily criticized area was photo-
graphy, while the evaluation highly praised the
“DAVIDSONIAN Report” and “Campus Com-

ment.”

Criticism of the photography centered around :
the use of art for the sake of art and the lack of. +
contrast in the technical quality of the pictures. :

IFC Reviews Rush Rules;
Letter Sets Off Discussion

The Interfraternity Council
discussed its newly-adopted
rush rules for next year Tues-
day night as students reacted
both pro and con on the 100
percent bidding proposal of
senior Bill Seigier in a letter
in last week’s DAVIDSON-
IAN.

IFC adviser Jim Terry re-
ported that the new rush
schedule passed in the prev-
jous meeting would require
faculty approval. He indicat-
ed, however, that the chances
for such approval were good.

Rush is set for the first
week in the winter term. -

In addition to the Thurs-
day-through-Sunday rush

Cumming Opens Doors

To British Year Abroad

The door to England's
crowded universities has been
pried open by a Davidson Col-
lege English professor, al-
lowing the school to begin its
first Junior Year in England
program this fall.

Dr. William P. Cumming,
former chairman of the Eng-
lish Department, has spent a
number of years during his
academic career studying in
the universities of England.
This year he persuaded the
University of East Anglia in
Norwich, England, to accept
two Davidson students for
1968-69, despite crowded en-
rollments in all of that coun-
try's universities.

Programs for junior year

study in Montpellier, France,
and Marburg, Germany, were
set up by Davidson in 1964-65,
allowing about a dozen stu-
dents to attend a university

schedule, there will be a
“period of silence’ or: ‘‘no-
contact’ time during the
Christmas break preceding
rush, and tentatively no per-
iod of silence from the end
of’ Christmas break ‘until the
Wednesday preceding the
first day of rush.

Freshman dormitories will
be off limits to all upper-
classmen except hall coun-
selors from the Monday pre-
ceding rush through ‘the next
Monday when bids have been
returned.

The discussion of 100 per-
cent possibilities presented
in Seigler's letter last week
has drawn varied reaction,
most favoring the present ex-
tended rush system.

IFC President Bobby Vagt.
for example, said that the
present system ‘“‘speaks well
for itself.’ Out of the 25 stu-
dents participating in the ex-
tended rush program, he con-
tinued, 13 have received bids.

Vagt noted that with the
adoption of a 100 percent sys-
tem, the fraternities would
run the serious risk of losing
national charters.

Terry termed the proposal
“ta little bit unreasonable; I
wouldn't say completely,
however. The students have
become a lot more mature in
their attitude toward frater-
nities.”

SGA President Joe Murphy
said that he agreed that Da-
vidson should greater initia-
lve in such proposals ‘‘in-
stead of waiting around for 40
or 50 schools to do something
first.”” But, he noted. ‘I don’t

think you could ever get fra-
ternity approval. It will not
work unless it is accepted
completely.”

In commenting. on nis own
letter, Seigler stressed that

he thought the extended rush
system was ‘‘a vast improve-
ment over the old system and
is working well. The frater:
nity presidents did a fine job
and are to be commended.”’

Johnson Serves_
Negro Customers

By DICK ANDERSON
Asst. Managing Editor

Student leaders of. the bar.
ber shop boycott group cal:
led off the boycott of John-
son's Barber Shop this
week; the owner, Ralph
Johnson, began serving Ne-
Gro customers there May 7.

Johnson declined com.
ment on the action. How-
ever, Tony Knox, one of his
employees, said, “I think it
was the right thing to do.”

Another barber, James
Rdeford, agreed with Knox.
“It's something that had to
be done, and I'm glad he did
it. It takes a lot of pressure
off us, the employees, and |
think we will profit by it.”
he said.

The integration of the bar-
ber shop followed several
weeks of boycotting and a
weék of picketing by stu-
dents, although most <stu-
dent activity had already
died down when the barber
shop was integrated.

The Davidson faculty had
also endorsed a student-spon-

sored resolution calling Tor
integration of the barber
shop, a public accommoda- ©
tions ordinance for Davidson.
a request for trustee endorse-
ment of the resolution and
support for possible esta-
blishment of an open bar-
ber shop should Johnston. re.
fuse to integrate his shop.

Several members of the
faculty also had formed an
informal committee, headed
by Dr. Dan Rhodes of the
Bible Department, to seek a ..
compromise with Johnson.
including an offer of finan-
cial support. Johnson turned
down the professors’ offers
earlier.

Davidson Mayor F. L..
Jackson had set’ up a
Mayor's Committee to study
a plan for a Davidson public
accommodations ordinance.
No definite action has been
taken by the Town Council.. .

“IT can understand: how
Mr. Johnson feels after 40
years of running ‘a segregat-
ed business,”’ Raeford said.
“but it was time for some-
thing to be done.”

Senate Misses Quorum
Twice; Bylaws Deferred

By DANNY WHITE
Steff Writer

The SGA _ Senate failed
twice this week to obtain a
quorum and postponed until
Monday the final passage of
the student bylaws. Six of the
14 articles in the bylaws re-
main unapproved by the
Senate.

Only six senators showed
at the regular Tuesday eve-
ning meeting of the Senate.
SGA President Joe Murphy
then calied a special meeting
for Thursday in order to give
final approval to the bylaws
before the end of the year
but only five senators were

present. Eight senators con-

stitute a quorum.

The Senate has been
plagued by poor attendance
in the last few weeks. Cur-
jously enough, earlier in the

semester the Senate waived
until the 1968-69 school term
a section in the standing
rules of the Senate which
would impose a_ financial
penalty on senators guilty of
excessive absence.

At present, the Senate has
approved eight articles of the
proposed bylaws, including
the standing rules. Other ar-
ticles approved include oath
of office, elections, duties of
SGA officers, judicial provis-
ions, freshman matters, and
chartering.

Articles remaining to be
approved consist of SGA
agencies, SGA publications,
finances, Senate officers, im-
peachment, amendment of
the constitution and referen-
dum and amendment of the
bylaws.

demic interest in areas of in-

The curriculum is a part. of

“The topics to be studied

Cowart. ‘Possibilities are un-
limited.’ Topics suggested so
far include Zen-Buddhism,
art and auto mechanics.

ty members. Each course will
meet for one quarter, one or
two hours a week, probably

on Tuesday nights,"’ said
Cowart.
The joint student-faculty

committee recently changed
its name from Experimental
College to Free University.
because the program is no
longer experimental. Wake
Forest and the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill
have already established
similar programs.

The committee also hopes
to brighten up the program
by working in conjunction
with Queens Collgee. In this
way students will have an
opportunity to meet girls in
an atmosphere other than a
purely social one, according
to Cowart.

“We hope to have 20
courses to start with, each
composed of 10 students.”
Cowart said. “One course
will be the poverty course
proposed by STEP. Our plan
is to incorporate the various
study groups now established
into one curriculum, along
with many new courses.”
