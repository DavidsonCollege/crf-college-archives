Weekend vandals
destroy Patterson Court
lampposts worth $6,000

By TRIPP HELMS

Vandals destroyed six lamp posts formerly
located near the PIKA and SPE houses last
weekend. :

The incident is still under investigation,
according to Director of Public Safety Jackie
Hughes, and no one has come forward with
information on the matter.

Hughes does not understand why students
insist on damaging the lampposts. “They [the
lampposts] are put there for the safety of the
students,” he explains.

Replacing the lamp posts will cost $6,000,
which makes this incident the most costly epi-
sode of vandalism the college campus has suf-
fered since $20,000 in damage was done to a

sculpture in 1986.
The posts are so expensive because they are
made of castiron, which cannot be welded when
broken. A post must be dug up and replaced
when it is damaged.

Vandalism has been decreasing over the past

of -

e

few years, but Hughes reports a sharp increase
this year.

This increase displeases Dean of Students
Will Terry. “I thought we had gotten over
this,” he said. a

_ Terry has decided in this case to turn the
matter over to the Honor Council for action if
the guilty students are found.

The Code of Responsibility includes penal-
ties for vandalism ranging in severity from a
warning, Censure, probation, a fine, commu-
hity service, restitution, and suspension.

Similar incidents of vandalism in 1985 to
lamp posts on Patterson Court were attributed
in part by Terry and Residence Life Director
Tom Jennings to alcohol abuse.

“T don’t know what the cause is,” Terry was
quoted at the time. “Tt just doesn’t make any
sense. It’s sort of like burning your own
ghetto.”

Jennings at the time said, “Mostly men are
the ones who vandalize, and it’s usually men

‘+ " whio have been drink-
ing.”

Students with any
information about the
incident should con-
tact the College Police
or.the Dean of Stu-
dents’ Office. L,
