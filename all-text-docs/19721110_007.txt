Cats Fall To William & Mary,
Seek Win Against Richmond

By JIM SITTERSON
Asst. Sports Editor

Head Coach Dave Fagg hopes
to bounce back this Saturday
against Richmond, following a
56-9 defeat at the hands of
William and Mary last
Saturday.

Fagg felt that the score of the
William and Mary game was
not indicative of the Wildcat’s
performance.

“It should have been a 35-33
game, the punting. fumbles and
interceptions hurt us,"" he said.

Early in the first quarter, a 23
yard Davidson punt gave the
Indians excellent field position
and they were able to score.
taking the early lead.

Davidson was able to come
back with a field goal, but the
game belonged to William and
Mary from then on.

“I said before the game that
we could go out and put
pressure on them. This is what
happened in the first quarter.
but after several bad breaks
they took the edge away from

Booters Fall In Playoff Tilt,
Title String Halted At Two

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

Playing ‘what had to be the
most exciting game of this year,

the Davidson soccer team
dropped a 1-0 sudden-death
overtime decision to

Appalachian State University
Tuesday at Belmont Abbey,
thus ending all hopes of a third
consecutive Southern
Conference crown.

“It was one of the finest
soccer games I have seen,”
explained Davidson coach
Harry Sogleman. “It was a real
hard fought contest.”

The game winning goal came
after six minutes of the sudden-

death period, which followed *

two five-minute overtime
sections after the regulation
match ending in a scoreless tie.

“It was a tough way to lose,”
sighed Fogleman. ‘‘That type of
goal could have been made by
either team and it would have
still been an _ unfortunate
occurance."

The lone tally came when a
Mountaineer shot ricochetted
off the crossbar, rolled in front
of an Appalachian lineman, and
was popped into the goal.

‘Both teams showed
exceptional ball control.’
praised the soccer mentor, who
is in his 11th season at
Davidson. “There was not a
corner kick in the first half.
That in itself is indicative of a
great game of ball control.”

Changing their season- -long
strategy of playing two goalies
per game, the Wildcats had
Paul Caldwell, senior goalie, in
the nets for the entire

marathon.

“I thought with the playing
conditions and weather being as
they were that we would benefit
more from playing a goalie the
entire game,” claimed
Fogleman. ‘I don’t know if it
was a mistake or not. I would
have done the same thing if I
had started Charlie Slagle. |
just felt one goalie was best.”

Caldwell played a fine game
at goal, giving up only the one
score, while making over 20
saves.

‘‘We got some good shots.’ he
said. ‘“‘We should have had
three goals at least, but they
just did not fall.”

Injuries had been a key factor
in the Wildcats’ season. In the
playoff encounter they were
minus two starters in Jack
Linard and Donnie Bain.

‘I thought it was an enjoyable
season, he said. “‘We have a
good bunch of boys. who gave
an awful lot. At times we really
looked great, but sometimes we
looked very poor."

summed up Fagg's
appraisal of the game.

Fagg was able to see some
bright spots in the loss. John
Webel ran well and appears to
be coming back from an ankle
injury, he indicated.

Fagg also felt that the wide
receivers Andy Davis and Walt
Walker had good days.

The bulk of Fagg’s praise
went to the offensive line. He
felt that, ‘They blocked well at
times,’ against a much larger
William and Mary line.

Davidson now stands 2-1-1 in
conference play. Fagg sees
tomorrow's contest as an
important game. “Richmond
has been one of the stronger
members of the conference in
recent vears,” according to
Fagg.

The heart of the Richmond
attack is the running game
which is centered around ‘the
best blocking fullback in the
South,"’ according to Fagg.

“They have two tailbacks
who can really run well, and
their fullback can run with the
ball too.”

The Spider's passing game.
while not spectacular, is more
than adequate.

“Their quarterback is a
veteran and their receivers doa
steady job of catching the ball.”
Fagg said.

The Richmond defense relies
primarily on a 5-2 formation.

“They have big tackles and
their defensive ends strip the

quarterback of the ball.’ Fagg
said.
The secondary, although

quick, may prove susceptable
to the Wildcat passing game.
Injuries have hurt the team in

the past several games and
Saturday will prove to be no
exception. Running back Dave
Ingold has missed the last two
games and will not play
Saturday.

Frank Shinn, Jim Hankinson,
Tom Fleischer and Eddie
Womack are ‘‘doubtable’’.
starters according to Fagg.

Fagg feels that, ‘‘The ability
to move the ball will be the key
to the game.”
