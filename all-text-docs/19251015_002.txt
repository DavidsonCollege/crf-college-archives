Up of Tournament Stars

Crosland, Carr, McCutcheon and
Alexander to Compose Tennis
Team

During the past two or three weeks 29 men
have been trying out for the tennis team,
and for the fall term the following four men
will compose a tentative team: Lake Mc-
Cutchen, captain; Dick Carr, Bob Crosland,
and W. A. Alexander.

Of the 20 odd men who tried out for the
team nine made an especially good showing,
these men were Don Stewart, Dick Carr,
Lake McCutchen, Bill Covington, Malcolm
Lockhart, W. A. Christian, Bob Crosland,
and H. M. Martin. Wood Brown was forced
to forfeit his match on account of sore feet.
The feature match of the tournament was
the match between Lockhart and Alexander.
This was very close and the outcome was for
a long time in doubt. Alexander won out,
7-5, 4-6, 13-11.

A certain number of men who made a
good showing in this tournament will run
off a “round robin” tournament next spring,
before the regular team for the spring
schedule will be selected. Those who now
compose the team are at best a_ tentative
team and several other good men who proved
their worth in the last tournament will be
given another chance.

The varsity team last year consisted of
fie men, four of whom were lost through

| graduation; they were Harry Price, Mac

Bell, Jimmy Trotter, and Tom Staley. Lake
McCutchen, the captain for this year,
the fifth man on the team.

Prospects seem to be as good, if not bet-
ter, than they were this time last year, and
from present indications Davidson should
take off additional honors in State tennis
circles,

HOW THEY PLAY

Again Caldwell, with his three
touchdowns, leads in the scoring for
the state grid stars, but Saturday's
games caused considerable change in
the line-up. . Karleskint, Wake Forest
ace, jumped up near the lead with three
touchdowns. Sparrow, of Carolina, is
tied with him, contributing a couple of
field goals with his touchdown.

THE BEST OF COOKING
Charlotte, N. C.

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

Three football games this week! And
all of them rare and rch. Rich in what is
left to your opinion.

First comes the All-Americans vs. All-
Internationals, this battle of wits to occur
on Thursday afternoon within the precincts
of Richardson Field—at least somewhere on
the field.

Second, the Wldkittens tackle their first
college freshman team, when P. C, yearlings
clash with the Davidson new men on Rich-
ardson Field, Friday afternoon at 3:00
o'clock.

And while color is expected to be dis-
played in these two games, the most colorful
will be the third, Presbyterian College vs.
Davdson College—the varsities, at Rock
Hill, S. C., Saturday.

Speaking of color makes us think that the
student at Davidson Saturday will get to see
that game in color, for red, green, yellow,
white and other kinds of colors will be used
on the blackboard in the gym, upon which the
students may be able to follow the Wildcats
up and down the field. The only difference
is that you don’t see the men trotting back
and forth.

We hope that the trotting will be mainly
forth, Not merely trotting forth upon the
field, but on down, down and still farther
down, until so many downs will have been
made that D, C. will have won a game.

|

But you know how stubborn these Presby-
terians are, They grudgingly give each inch,
and doggedly fight each moment. If you
don't believe it, look at this:

1919—P, C., 0; Davidson, 0.
1920—P. C., 7; Davidson, 0.
1921—P. C., 0; Davidson, 7.
1922—P, C., 8; Davidson, 7.
1923—P. C., 0; Davidson, 3.
1924—P. C., 3; Davidson, 15.

Which do you want? A specal to Carolina
that stops at Mooresville, Barbers Junction,
Mocksville, Winston-Salem; Greensboro,
Burlington and Chapel Hill? Or one that
leaves Davidson and stops at Winston-
Salem, Greensboro and Chapel Hill? Well,
it all depends upon the number of men that
make the trip.

While football is uppermost in every Da-
vidson student’s mind just now, remember
that other athletic progress is being made.
These classes are getting in trim for their
cage clashes.

The wrestling men are getting down to
work early this year, and are expecting to
give the Plebes of Annapolis a “run for their
money.”

The tennis team for fall engagements has
been chosen and consists of McCutchen, the
only letter man of last year, with W. A.
Alexander, Crosland and Carr as partners.

The long, lean and lanky distance runners,
as well as the stockily built lengthy sprint-
ers, are meandering back and forth each day
between Davidson and somewhere, strength-
ening their muscles and getting in shape.

Golf aspirants and the billy goat are oc-
cupying the course every day, new devotees
of this sport progressing or retrogressing as
the case may be. :

And soon we'll mention campus football,
after real football has passed.

A number of men and Kimbrough are
warming up wth the horsehide, too. ;

BEAVER CLUB NAME OF
SOPH’S SOCIETY

During the past week ten members of
the Sophomore class founded a new
honor society. The object of this society
is to promote friendliness towards all or-
ganizations that visit the campus. This
applies not only to athletic teams but al-
socto debaters, speakers and ‘so forth.
It is of paramount importance that all

Coach Mattox’ Squad is
Ready for P.C. Freshmen

First Game With Bluestockings
Fresh to be Played at Davidson
—Hard Drill This Week

The Davidson Wildkittens and the little
Blue Stockings of the P. C. Freshmen will
clash on Richardson Field tomorrow. As
the game comes just a day before the contest
between the older brothers of the two
schools it is assured that it wll be highly
interesting.

Little is known of the strength of the
South Carolinians, but reports have reached
the campus that they have a team equally as
strong as they had last year when Stamps,
Dugan and the other horsemen threw such
a scare into the camp of the Davidson fresh-
men, Wilson, the Presbyteran quarter, is
said to be equally as good as his famous
brother “Shorty.” Kirvin, a stock lineman
from Sumter, is to be feared if the reports
coming from Clinton are true.
brother of “Bull” Kirvin, who was a terror
to P. C.’s opponents several years ago.

Coach Mattox has been drilling his men
hard this past week in view of the game.
The fresh were defeated in their first game
of the season last Friday by High Point
