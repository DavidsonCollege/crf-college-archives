Weinsteins give $2.2 millio

a

Carole and Marcus Weinstein
(pronounced “wine-stine”) recently
donated $2.2 million to the College
in honor of former President Sam
Spencer °40 and his wife Ava.

The main lobby of Chambers

will be named the Spencer Lobby,
and Duke Residence Hall’s non-
residential section, currently known
as The Dean Rusk International
Studies Center, will be named The
Weinstein Center. The Dean Rusk
staff offices will be known collec-
tively as the Spencer Office Suite.

ment of the outstanding education
that Davidson has provided for
generations of students, and it is
also an investment in the college’s
future,” Marcus Weinstein said. “In
particular, I hope this gift will sup-
port Davidson’s ongoing efforts to
bring the college the most talented
students from all backgrounds, so
that bright people can engage with
and learn from a broad spectrum of
their peers.”

The College has not yet decid-
ed what exactly the money will be
used for.

“Because these buildings al-
ready exist, this gives us some
flexibility with how we choose to
use the money,” Director of Do-
nor Relations Denise Howard said.
“It will be used to fund some col-
lege priority, and this will be the
decision of President Ross. In this
economy there are all sorts of dif-
ferent priorities we can identify.”

Spencer, who was Davidson’s
president from 1968 to 1984, spear-
headed conversations to establish
the Dean Rusk International Stud-
ies Program and helped reinforce
the College’s emphasis on interna-
tional studies. He also was known
for his efforts to recruit underrepre-
sented minorities and international
students. Under Spencer, Davidson
was integrated and women were
first admitted.

Spencer explained that he was
not aware of the gift until “the day it
was announced. This was a surprise
to me and my wife, but I thought
it was wonderful that they would
be so generous to Davidson.” The

Students spend weekend serving

ALLIE COKER
Staff Writer

Once a month, the Community
Service Office at Davidson Col-
lege offers a service and reflection
opportunity called Service Satur-
day. Students are welcome to sign
up online for any opportunity they
wish—and the opportunities vary.

Working with sites such as the
Second Harvest Food Bank, Urban
Ministry Center and Florence Crit-
tenton Services, Service Saturdays
aim to have a wide range of service
sites in order to appeal to every-
one.

The goal is for 10-12 students
to gather with faculty and staff at
a local service site in order to help
the community, while learning
about non-profits at the same time.
A portion of the Saturday is also

devoted to reflecting on service and
their views concerning different so-
cial issues.

Ashley Lyles ’10 led a Service
Saturday this past weekend to Flor-
ence Crittenton Services, an orga-
nization that provides services such
as medical care, adoption and par-
enting support and substance abuse
intervention to single mothers and
their babies.

The group’s main service was
to clean and maintain the building
these services are supported in,
while learning more about the pur-
pose of Florence Crittenton.

The organization’s mission
statement is, according to their
website, “providing single moth-
ers and their babies comprehen-
sive medical/prenatal care, social,
educational, adoption and parent-
ing support services, as well as,

substance abuse intervention, treat-
ment and prevention.

Promoting health and hope
for tomorrow’s children, Florence
Crittenton Services provides an
opportunity for a healthy pregnan-
cy, healthy baby and positive life
choices.”

The agendas usually span from
8:30 a.m. to around 2 p.m. so that
students still have plenty of time to
tend to homework and other after-
noon responsibilities.

All students are eligible to par-
ticipate. To learn more, go to the
Community Service Office page
on the Davidson website and look
under the Service Trips section.
Or, you can email emmoser or stri-
emer.

WALT:
returns

BRENNA KELLY _
Staff Writer

= Last’ Wednesday marked

the first WALT broadcast of the
2009-2010 school year. This
year, the student-run radio sta-
tion, which has been in operation
since the 1980s, is in the hands
of the “Holy Trinity,” that is,
its three station managers: Craig
Cangemi 710, Ryan Cockman
z'10 and Laura Zulliger 10.

“port that WALT, which broad-
casts on radio station 1610 AM
on the Davidson campus, has
shown an increase in student in-
volvement since last year. They
said that there were many seniors
who hosted shows who gradu-
ated in 2009, but fortunately this
has not hindered the participa-
tion of other students.

“We had more freshmen
join this year,” Cockman said.
Cangemi added that “the fresh-
man class seems to be really ex-
cited about it.”

There are nearly 50 DJs this
year, and around 30 shows. The
shows on WALT are mainly mu-
sical, though there are several
sports talk shows as well.

“It’s adiverse group,” Cange-
mi said. “Some play world mu-
sic, some play rap...we play
metal.” (Cangemi and Cock-
man’s show is called “Blood
Death, Etc.” and airs on Sundays
at 10 p.m.).

Jessie Parker ’12, along with
Rebecca Hawk 712 and Hannah
Wright ’12, has a show called the
“Family Hymnal Earth Thump-
ing Sisters.” This show, which
airs at 10 on Wednesday nights,
plays “a pretty sweet and eclec-
tic playlist,” according to Parker,
and loosely centers on the title’s
theme.

“We each have slightly dif-
ferent music tastes, but our tastes
compliment each other well, and
usually combine for a pretty hi-
larious night,” she said. “One of
my favorite weeks was themed
‘Nassty,’ and we played. some
good ol’ funk tunes with some
blatant sexual innuendos and
also threw in some Spank Rock,
Chaka Kahn, James Brown,
etc.”

While WALT does broadcast
via the radio, most listeners can
access it through the internet.

“Two years ago we started
live-streaming so people off-
campus could listen to it,” Cock-

man said. The website, www.
