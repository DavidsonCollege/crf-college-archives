Terry

Continued from Back Page

Terry: One suggestion has been
that we not hitch these two to-
gether. We work on the alcohol
policy and then we work on the
rush policy. They think that solv-
ing one problem gets in the way of
the other.

Davidsonian: Are freshmen not
allowed to goto any wet parties the
first semester?

Terry: That’s what this policy
says. The one weekend night was
for a dry rush party.

Davidsonian: So, essentially
freshmen wouldn’t be allowed to
drink first semester.

Terry: On the court.

Davidsonian: Do-you have any
concerns that if freshmen aren’t
allowed to drink in a social situ-
ation first term, that we’re going to
be a suitcase school?

Terry: I hear that all the time and
that may be true. That certainly is
of concern to me, but the dilemma
is do you then encourage: their
abuse. Their abuse is certainly
~ encouraged now.

Davidsonian: It seems like the

whole first semester will be spent -

avoiding the whole problem of

letting freshmen drink. Its kind of

saying that alcohol is completely
_ off limits to them.

Terry: Yes, but the dilemma is
how do you do that and make any
pretense of abiding by the law.

The law is the problem. The lawis -

the fundamental problem. If we
didn’t have this law we would\not
have the problem we have n o w
and if we did have the problem we
could solve it without having to
take these kinds of measures. It’s
the most stupid law that was ever
conceived for a college campus
and it does not curb abuse, it en-
“ courages it.

Davidsonian: What were your
ideas about rush?

Terry: I'd like to see us move
toward a dry rush. I would cer-
tainly like to shorten rush, and I
‘haven’t found anybody who
doesn’t wanttodothis. The CCRL

talked about setting aside a period
of rush and making it dry, thereby
separating it from this policy of
distributing alcohol.

Davidsonian: People have sug-
gested shortening rush?

Terry: Dozens, and lots of presi-
dents.

Davidsonian: Some feel its an
advantage to have a longer rush,
have you heard any from this side,
because at some schools they have
a two week rush and its pretty
ridiculous.

Terry: Oh, yes. I think that’s too
short. That’s why I suggested fin-
ishing it before Thanksgiving. On
the other hand I do have a problem
with freshmen men spending al-
most six of their eight months
dealing with getting in and getting
initiated in a fraternity. I think
that’s a distorted view of the way
to spend your freshmen year. So,
from my viewpoint what would be
ideal to do is to finish it before
Thanksgiving so that people could
come back and concentrate on
exams and so forth. Then, start
pledging immedi: «ly after they
make their grades and get in the

fraternity, and have that over by .

the end of February. So they have
Marchand April and the little bit of
time in May to enjoy life and live
the normal life of a sophomore,
junior and senior.

Davidsonian: Doesitconcern you
that houses may rent more places
off campus to have parties on the

..weekends?....,

Terry: Sure, I would prefer for all
houses to have parties on campus.
I think that’s safer and it contrib-
utes more to community. But, I
think that we can’t be held hostage
to that. Once again, if we didn’t
have that law we wouldn’t have
this problem. But we got it so we
have to deal with it.

Davidsonian: Have you thrown
around any numbers for the limits
on kegs and the limits on the
number of parties per week, that’s
left totally wide open.

Terry: Nobody has really dis-
cussed it. I left it blank for obvious
reasons, I wasn’t going to do that
‘by myself.

Davidsonian: Why did you de-
cide to keep kegs?

Terry: I think you can control
things better with kegs, particulary
if you control the number of kegs
you can control the amount you
distribute. I gather that the SigEps
have been pretty good at doing that
when they buy the cases of beer
and distribute them and I really
don’t have any problem with that.
This is a complete turn-around for
me. When we started revising the
policy last year, I was so hot for
BYOB and the court convinced
me that that was not a good idea.
From a liability standpoint, and
this is why the national fraternities
like it, it is a dream.

I think that in itself, from a
legal standpoint, is not very sound
because if you provide the house,
the occasion and the mechanism
for allowing beer to be taken, I’m
not sure if that house still isn’t
liable in some way. But, it’s cer-
tainly less liable. Liability is a
concern, but that’s not my primary
concern. My primary concern is
abuse. I think kegscontrol it more.
The Duke experiment is far from
perfect, but they find the keg is
better than BYOB and they require
kegs.

Davidsonian: If abuse is the main
priority, couldn’ta lot of the provi-

-sionscould be met by better educa-

tion at the houses themselves?

Terry: We’ll do a lot of that any-
way. As faras I’m concerned if we
see that the abuse is being limited
without all these nit-picking rules,
I'd be perfectly willing to draw
back from them. I think the fewer
rules you have the better. Look at
the present Patterson Coutt-alco-
hol policy, its one rule right after
another. Students often are very
creative in getting around the pol-
icy. There’s nothing new about
that. I’m not very sanguine about
education as the answer to abuse
becauseI don’ tthink thereare many
students who would not know what
abuse is and what it isn’t, yet they
go on doing it. There are.plans to
increase the education and that’s
in the policy, with both freshmen
and upperclassmen.

Davidsonian: Talk about the is-

sue of monitors again.

.Terry:: I think they need to be

designated, with some sort of vest
or something like that, so that
people we’ll know who they are.
So, if somebody needs help they’1l
know who to goto. My suspicion

is if you were at the KA house and:

somebody from Sig Ep or Warner
Hall needed a monitor for some-

thing, they wouldn’tknow who the
heck themonitor was. Members of
the house might, but others
wouldn’t. I think they (monitors)
need to be designated. They would
be the main people to help some-
body in trouble and to report viola-
tors of the policy.

Davidsonian: Who would handle
violations of the alcohol policy?

Terry: There’s the formation of
an Alcohol Enforcement Commit-
tee to handle such violations, which
is described in the policy. I’m not
smart enough to be able to deal
with all that nor do I have the time
to deal with that by myself. The
Honor Council certainly can’t
handle all of that. We’d have to
pay them to meet. I think that will
give people a more even-handed
approach to it too. That’s not just
for the houses, that’s not just for
the courtit’s for the residence halls,
for somebody drinking in the sta-
dium--any alcohol violation on this
campus.

Davidsonian: How long are you
going to take suggestions to this
policy?

Terry: TheCCRL will meetagain
on March 19. I’d like to have them
at least by the 17 so I can correlate
them and have them in some
manageable form to them. It’s
going to take us more than one
week to come up with the final
draft. The Trustees meet on April
24, and the mailing will probably
have to go out by the week of April
13th.

Davidsonian: So, by next fall we
will definitely have a new alcohol

policy. *

Terry: Unless the Trustees say
“we don’t want this.’

Davidsonian: Is there anything t
that we missed that you might want
to comment about?

Terry: Students are a part of this
process and that is as it must be, but.
I really do think that our history
proves that the Trustees and the
Dean’s Office has really tried to
make the students responsible for
this area of their life, particulary on

Patterson Court, with almost no g:

intrusion, except to tell them that
they have to have a policy, and its
my honest opinion that they have-
n’t done it very responsibly. I

think that’s also the Trustees opin- |
ion. Theré was one Trustee who |

said we ought to give them the rest
of the spring, but the consensus of
that meeting was that we have given
them two to three years and noth-
ing much has improved, now we’ ve
gotto move on. Students cancrea-
tively come up withasound policy
if they are willing to spend the
brain power to do it. That’s what
I want them to do, but if they can’t
do that then we’ll have to move in
other directions.
