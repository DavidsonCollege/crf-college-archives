Lanin's Reputation At Stake

The return of a ‘Lester Lanin
Orchestra”’ to the campus for Home-
coming will doubtless be met with
mixed opinion by the Student Body.
Mr. Lanin’s men met with something
less than overwhelming success when
they last appeared at Davidson for
Spring Frolics of 1958.

immediately after Spring Frolics.
Bob Jones, President of the Inter-Fra-
ternity Council: at. that time. wrote a
four page letter to Mr. Lanin criticiz-
ing the work of his orchestra. Jones
carefully pointed: out that the music
Was not “continuous. as promised.
and cited drinking and generally poor
conduct on the part. of the members
of the orchestra during the dance.
One band member’ even asked a stu-
dent if he could put. him in contact
with a “little chick” after the dance.

President Jones was quite within
his rights and duties to complain to
Lanin about such conduct, and es-
pecially about the general poor quali-
ty of the music.

Through his agent. Mr. Nev Wag-
ner of Charlotte. Lahin made the In-
ter-fraternity Council an apology for
the failure of’ the Spring Frolics en-
gagement and asked to be allowed to

return to the campus for Homecom:
ing to attempt to rectify any ill feel-
ing engendered by the appearance.
Lanin further offered to bring his
band back at a considerably reduced
price.

The decision as to whether a Lanin
Orchestra would return was left to
the new Interfraternity Council. un-
der the leadership of Vernon Ander-
son. After careful consideration they
decided to sign Lanin for Homecom-
‘ing. and take what they admit to be
“a gamble”

We believe that the decision was
made correctly. Mr. Lanin has staked
at least a portion of His well known
national reputation on his ability to
put on a good series of dances at Da-
vidson. If he Has any eve at. all for
good public relations he will leave
no stone unturned to convince every
member of the Student Body that
the spring performance was the ex-
ception rather than the rule.

lf Homecoming ts successful, and
we believe it will be. the Interfraterni:
tv Council should be credited. for its
capable handling of the problem in
the best interests of the Student
Body.

Dean of Faculty Basic Defect

Faces Problems

Dr. Frontis W. Johnston steps in-
to his new job as Dean of the Faculty
facing a number of challenges and
problems. some of which have long
plagued the campus.

-Overcrowded elasses. understaffed
departments. a static curriculum, and
improving the status of the faculty are
only a few of the items that will now
come .under his bailiwick.

The problem ot overcrowded
classes, which, this year for the first
time. reached extreme proportions.
can be seen clearly in the well-known
professor’s own “back yard.” as his
History 73 class is bulging at the
seams with its number of over one-
tenth the student body approaching
the “university level.”

Dr. Johnston has gone on record
against increasing the enrollment ov-
er .1000 and it is not his personal de-
sire to add the 30 or more extra stu-
dents to the freshman class next year.
Recognizing the basic fact that cer-
tain inherent values of a small liberal
arts college would be destroyed if
the enrollment gets too high. he be-
lieves that facilities now are adequate
but “not best.” We agree with his
opinion that quality, and not quanti-
ty, should be as big as possible.

Much has been. said in the past
about the need to improve our
courses of study. Im the last few years,
the Math and Language Departments,
and lately, the Bible Department have
shown the way to a revised and re-
-vitalized curriculum.

But at most, the labors of these
three departments represent only a
feeble effort toward revision and es-
sentially the outmoded curriculum
has remained unimpaired. Other de-
partments should make their move-
toward livening up their courses. The
new Dean has indicated he will work
for a more significant curriculum by
conducting a thorough study of what
is good and what is weak. He has al-
so promised to add new professors
wherever they are needed.

President Martin has made a wise
choice in his appointment of Dr.
Johnston, who, we are confident, will
demonstrate his executive ability in
maintaining the college’s high stan-
dards and overcoming some of its
present difficulties —S.R.L.

Of Davidson

Several days ago, there.was a sign
on a bulletin board in the. College
Union which said: - Is anybody presi-
dent of the Young Democrats?” It.
seems that a letter. had been sent to
the Idcal Young Democrats but that
no one connected with the organiza-
tio could be found to receive it. Even
a public posting of the letter brought
no response.

The Young Republicans are also
now extinct. apparently, and it has
been a long time since either of the
two organizations carried on any sort
of activities. This is not necessarily a
bad thing, and the passing away of
two student organizations should not
be an occasion for mourning unless
there is some good reason for it.

A reason exists, however, and it
is a good one. For the cessation of
interest in party politics among Da-
vidson students is indicative of a
much more general and deeply root-
ed unconcern with national and in-
ternational affairs in many different
fields — politics. economics, social
problems, intellectual life, religion.

Thus we are confronted with what
is perhaps the hasic defect of a David-
son education: the lack of a climate
of thought and opinion that is recep-
tive. not just to new ideas, but to any
ideas at all. This prevailing attitude
of intellectual indifference does, not
extend to all students, of course. nor
is it peculiar to Davidson, but it is
hard .to keep from concluding that
Davidson is a particularly bad exam-
ple of an institution in which students
assimilate great quantities of intel-
lectual material .in their academic
courses bunt pay no attention what-
ever to the current issues which give
meaning to the abstract material they
have ingested.

That this is a basic failure in the
educational process is undeniable,
and it is a failure for which the facul-
ty, the administration, and the trus-
tees cannot be blamed. It is the fault
of the students themselves, and
whether such attempts as are now
being made to awaken interest in poli-
tics and current affairs (see back
page) will succeed. depends on them
alone. ‘You can lead a horse to wa-
ter, but you can't make him drink.”

AND EDUCATION

Student Examines Educational Emphasis;
Asks Renewed Liberal Arts Appreciation

By JOHN COOLEY
Reactions to overemphasized
points of view often become as
hackneyed as the positions they
attack. Such. I believe. is the
case in the anti-science talk
which encounters the Sputnik-
seared educators of our land.
Perhaps the two schools of
thought—one emphasizing the
liberal side of' education, the
other the technical side—have
balanced cach other. This does
not, however, seem to be the
case on this campus.
$400,000 says that
“science is at the top of
it” in the world. So ap-
propriate steps are being
taken to prepare the David-
son student for the scien-
tific life. There is no ques-
tion that the proposed
science building is need-
ed and welcomed on cam-
pus. it is hoped that the

Monsoon ..

perspective with which the

sciences are viewed will

be improved coordinately.

It.is unfortunate that we stu-
dents so often think of our ed-
ucation as pre-thig or pre-that.
Too few are the opportunities
to pursue education for the
sake of knowledge and to con-
sider oitr present vocation that
of being students. But even
when practical and cconomic
factors force us to consider our
education as job-training, we
should be concerned—perhaps
more so — with the fullness of
our education,

As a liberal arts college,
Davidson claims to be
“primarily concerned with
preparing its graduates not
simply for making a living,
but for living more abun-
dantly.” | wonder if this is
compatible with the idea
that we primarily “go to

college to get our fools to

work with,” the principle

apparently underlying the

Dana Science Building. Is

it not of at least equal if

not greater importance to
be educated in the use of
science as o tool?

But we could seek to pro-
duce “whole men" even if Da-
vidson were a “pre-med prep
school.” One does not have to
major in a non-science course
to become acquainted with the
non-scientific fields of study,
Presumably, though. Davidson
is not to be centered on pre-
med or pre-business courses. It
is disappointing then to see
students necessarily discour-
aged from majoring in the onc-
man departments: philosophy,
sociology. and political science.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Integration Issue, Enrollment Growth
Draw Harsh Comment From Students

Dear Editor:

Realizing myself the varied
sentiments, opinions, and pana-
ceas offered on the problem
which you so convincingly
solved for the minds of us read-
ers. I wish to offer what I think
is the opinion of many.

No one really believes that
abandoning the public schools
is the only choice to compliance
with the Supreme Court’s or-
ders. Education must be pre-
served: yet integration is not
“our only alternative.”

COURT CRUSADE

Nine and possibly  cleven
Southern states are concerned
in this desperate clash with the
Supreme Court. The rest of the
U.S. watches in varying de-
grees of apprehension as the
old concents of states rights and
sovereignty are being whittled
down in the Court’s crusade to
substitute its will for impartial
judgnient and usurp the powers
of both the legislative and
executive branches of our gov-
ernment.

PRIVATE SCHOOLS

Admittedly, the actual clos-
ing of a white school could
cause many, who oppose inte:
gration as a matter of principle,
to shift their sentiments to-
ward integration under the cir-
cumstances. And yet what dif-
ference does it make whether
the schools open September 15
or October 15? The delay
doesn’t amount to much. Ac-

creditation

‘of the “private
schools,” if such are set up,
might. present’ a problem, but
practically all of the Southern
colleges and universities would
accept qualified students.

How have we got into such
a mess, anyway? The truth is
that the weakest branch of gov-
ernment — the jadicial — has
steadily reframed the Consti-
tution to suit the will of the
Supreme Court, And the Court
had repeatedly upheld the right
of a State to operate its public
schools on a “sepurate but
equal” basis until it pandered
to sociological findings in its
1954 reversal.

CHOICE NOT CLEAR

Indeed the South is involved
in a great crisis but no such
thing as “a tragie climax” has
been reached. The choice is not
so clear-cut as integration or

school closing. Neither will
work as there will be trouble
either way.

To err is human, and even
the Editor is not divine.
Doug Balentine

Dear Editor:

There appeared in the DA-
VIDSONIAN last week a state-
ment by a member of the Board
of Trustees to the effect that
the classes and other facilities
at Davidson were not overtaxed.
This attitude seems character-
istic of the entire Board.

SNAIL’S PACE

lf the Board thinks that ov-

ercrowding is being exaggerat-

(VE NEVER CHASED A
RABBIT...I'VE NEVER BARKED
AT A BURGLAR...

Zs

ed, may I suggest that the en-
tire bloated Board be herded
into any chemistry lab and be
required to complete an ex-
periment in the allotted time.
Labs are so crowded now that
work’ is slowed to a snail's
pace. Or better, let a few mem-
bers of the Board sleep in the
showers in the gym! If they
still are not convinced, then
let them sit in a window sill
to take notes on a lecture—or
sit in the narthex of the church
for Vespers. The trustee who
could experience this, and still
conclude that conditions were
being exaggerated would indeed
be a foolish man!

LARGE CLASSES

Sixty persons are entirely too
many to have in one class at
Davidson. Davidson supposedly
prides herself on the closeness
and warmth of her student-
faculty relations. Such could
not exist in large classes: per-
sonal attention from one pro-
fessor in so large a mob would
be humanly impossible. This re-
lationship is one of Davidson's
unique features, which in-
fluenced many students in their
decision to come here.

If a man wants such huge
classes, then let him go to a
large university. Or better still,
since we have trustees with
large university ideals, we
could initiate a trustee-exchange
program with some of the large
universities in this area.

med prep school’ only.” It
is not too assuring to know
that while hundreds of
thousands of dollars are
going into science,  in-
creased enrollment (the
new dorm), and fraternity
houses, there are no pres-
ent plans for faculty ex-

increase in faculty salaries.

The Dana Challenge Program
is a great financial challenge.
Perhaps it will also challenge
us — students, administration,
trustees, and alumni—to make
sure that the liberal arts basis
upon which Davidson is found-

pansion, curriculum  re- ed will be maintained and
vision, or more than usual strengthened.

Occasional Dispersion
Requested Ot Faculty

By JOHN TOUMARAS

in any college more stimulation of awareness is ,im-
parted through informal gatherings between students and
professors than through classroom techniques. There are
many reasons why such gatherings do not take place more
often at Davidson. One principal reason is that few stu-
dents make any effort to engage in prolonged conversa-
tions with faculty members. -Yet no matter how deter-
mined an effort any student might make, one stumbling
block remains—the professorial bloc which occupies the

south end of the Union

snackbar. Faeulty, would you

please adopt a policy of occasional dispersion?

Speaking of the Union, perhaps ! spoke too soon
about the quality of the coffee. And perhaps I shouldn’t
even unearth the subject of snackbar service. But 1 wiil.
It’s lousy! There is never enough change in the cash
register, yet the volume of business remains fairly con-
stant. The tables are still sticky and patrons aren’t wait-
ed upon in the order of their arrival. The help (and I
will name no names) is often indifferent to the point of
disecourtesy. Why not establish a self-service coffee and
doughnut stand. Let's see if the Honor System really

works!

Having a copy of the proposed YMCA budget before
me, and not having a thorough knowledge of smooth and
efficient business operations, I am somewhat confused.
Why is the outlay for “Social Life’ twice as large as
that for ‘Spiritual Life’? Isn't the estimate for ‘“Automo-
bile Depreciation” a bit high? How many “discretions”
can one purchase for $250 or is “Discretionary Fund” the
ecclesiastical terminology for ‘Miscellaneous Expenses?”

if

The Vesper's overflow re-
mains the most critical un-
solved problem of immediate
proportions at Davidson, and
merits the consideration and co-
operation of all.

The problem needs to be
viewed as separate from the
whole area of compulsory religi-
ous exercises. The institution of
Vespers should rise or fall on
its own merits or its lack of
them, which are principally
spiritual in nature. The more
pragmatic situation of overflow
used as a fulcrum by which to
pry out the established system
both evades the moral issue and
brings the foundations of the
Vesper institution to levels far
below those felt by its support-
ers and recognized by its op-
ponents.

SENIOR EXEMPTION

It has been suggested that a
group. preferably seniors. be
exempted from Vesper atten-
dance in order to alleviate con-
ditions. The objections here are
strong. Vesper exemption would
become a thing to be gained and
the system as one promoting
maturity undermined. Seniors
would unlearn habits which had
taken three years to form;
thereby one of the central sup-
ports of the institution would
be removed, that of the ten-
dency of the memory of Vesper
attendance to bring outwardly
alumni back to the Church and
thus potentially to vital Chris-
tian experience.

A well-defined exemption of a
particular group on special ov-
erflow Sundays has better po-
tential but does not offer a
satisfactory permanent solution
for a student body of one
thousand or more.

The substitution of morning

Overflow Vespers
Critical Problem

By DAVID ROBINSON

church attendance for the Ves-
per requirement has_ special
limitations if such attendance
is confined to Davidson Church-
es. Local congregations and
ministers would almost certain-
ly resent the presence of cap-
tive worshippers in their morn-
ing services If attendance were
permitted at a morning service
anywhere, the honor system
would be overstretched due to -
the complete unenforceableness
of the system and the idea of
a united, worshipping collegrate
community most compictely
destroyed. The technicalities of
attendance registration and
the effect of this upon worship
would at least complicate this
attempt at solution.

TWO-SERVICE SYSTEM

The most workable solution
—both spiritually and practical-
ly—may lie in some sort of two-
service system. Admittedly, this
would put a heavy and perhaps
impossible strain upon the
visiting minister or, if he were
to preach at only one service,
make the other less desirable
to those bound to attend. There
would be no suitable method
of insuring attendance distri-
bution sufficiently equitable to
prevent an overflow of one of
the services. The unity of a
worshipping collegiate com-
munity would be to greater or
lesser extent destroyed, de-
pending upon the particular
system. There may, nonethe-
less, be some value in a two-
service solution in which one
is conducted as present-day Ves-
pers and the other along the
line of denominational fellow-
ship programs with partial stu-
dent leadership, the two appeal-
ing to different temperaments
of worship.

Much more postively work-
able. than this, however, is the
concept of a Freshman Vespers
Progeam — reasonably suitable
and eluding most of the ob-
jections raised in the para-
graph above. This fails to solve
the immediate 1958-59 probleni
but would provide some unity
of worship, assured distribu-
tion of attendance, and a po-
tentially valuable class con-
sciousness, besides insuring a
mature respect for the larger
Vesper program.
