Stimulus Programs.

All three of the group discus-

it began under the direction of and Mike Bates. Dr. Locke

White and Chuck Matthews. and
Dr. Philip Secor and Steve
Humphries. ,

Faculty leaders were impress-
ed with the results of the first
meetings.

“1 enjoy hearing students’
views,’ commented Dr. Kelton,
a faculty participant. I especial-
ly like the idea of using tapes
as discussion material.”

Dr. White commended the

MORALITY

program and said, “It is desir-
able for students and faculty to
talk on a more equal basis than
is possible in the classroom.”

Dr. Charles Lloyd, another
faculty discussion member, com-
mented on the scale of the pro-
gram and pointed to the excite-
ment generated in the meet-
ings.

“I think it is very important
to get insight into others’ minds
on big ideas. I learn a whole

lot. and it’s a good opportunity
to blow off steam, which I may
do too much. I am amazed at
people’s tolerance, though, be-
cause I get pretty impossible in
those discussions,” Lloyd com-
mented. ;

In making up the separate
groups, Mooty admits that he
tried to avoid any great person.
ality conflicts between faculty
members. “But you can't put
three professors together with-

out disagreement on something,"
Mooty said. ‘and I think this is
healthy.”

Monday night two groups dis-
cussed parts of Kenneth Boul-
bing's book, The Meaning of the
Twentieth Century, while the
other talked about a tape re.
cording, “Capitalism and De-
mocracy.”

Mooty cilted the sexual revo-
lution and the role of mass me-
dia in the U.S. as possible top-

ics for the future. The final de-
cision on which topic will be
covered rests on the individual
group's leaders.

Mooty sald, “The program
grew out of the need for a
structural relationship between
students and faculty, and I feel
it presents a rare opportunity.
If there is any advantage to Da-
vidson at all, it's the possibility
of participation in something
like this.”

Scientific Method Denounced

Scholastic use of the scientific
method was declared invalid by
Tuesday's chapel speaker, Paul
Craig Roberts.

Because good and bad judg-

- ments cannot be conclusively

proved by the scientific meth.
od, he said. modern scholars

: feel that these judgments must

be omitted when talking about
science.

This leads to an age of skep-
ticism and doubt which has
marks of hypocrisy. Outwardly
professors teach their students
to doubt, but, Roberts conclud-
ed, “the teachers want you to
doubt what others teach you,
but not what they teach you.”

“What I want you to doubt is
the outlook of modern scholar-
ship, period,’’ he emphasized.

He pointed out that neurolog-
ists claim they can explain the
mind in terms of chemistry: D.
O. Hebb says that since the
mind is not a definite fact. ‘‘we
must doubt its existence.”

This atmosphere of skepticism,
Roberts said. encourages man to
“seek refuge for traditional opin-
dons'' through doubt, rejecting
authority and believing only
what can be ascertained by
knowledge.

Roberts claimed that the doc.
‘trine of doubt is inconsistent. If
it were consistent, everyone
would become “unlearned de-
bators.” It is not objective de-
tachment but reverence which
allows the recognition of great
men.

He criticized fields such as
social anthropology and _ sociol-
ogy for teaching without regard
to moral values.

*‘Head-hunting can be justified
by saying . . . that it promotes
good economic and cultural re-
lations . . .; morality is replac-
ed by conformity . . .; sociol-
ogists do not ask whether social
actions are good or bad, but
simply explain them.”

Evil is considered good, he
said, if it is “functional.” Stal-
in. who ‘‘murdéred more than.
Hitler,”’ is considered a success
because he industrialized Rus-
sia. Intellectuals are not op-
posed to communist tyranny “‘if
not outside certain bounds.”

Ratliff Describes Pakistan Situation

By JOE JONES
Staff Writer

Pakistan and the experiences
of an economist-missionary there
were described by Dr. Charles
_E. Rauliff, professor of econom-
ics, at Open End Wednesday
night.

He has just returned to David-
son this year following three
years as a professor at Forman
Christian College in Lahore.

Ratliff began by describing
the economic situation. Pakis-
tan. with half the population of
the U. S.,~has a gross national
product of $8 billion compared
to $100 billion for the U. S.

There are a few extremely
wealthy families, and the mass-
es are very poor despite a land
reform. He told of seeing peo-
ple whose homes were ‘under
a burlap bag put over some
sticks.”

Under a twenty-year econom.
ic plan, the government of Pak-
istan plans to triple the GNP
and to double the per capita in-
come.

“Islam does not oppose birth
control as does the Roman Cath.
olic -Church. However, some
Moslems are opposed to birth
control.” he said. |

He traced this opposition to

the family system, which, as
one Pakistani told him, is their
“social security.”

In giving reasons for Pakis-
tan's low productivity Ratliff
stated, “Education may be the
single most important factor in
economic development.”

Lack of technical skills is an-
other problem. “I had to show
a guy how to use a screwdriv-
er.”

Other problems include poor
health, remnants of the caste
system, and failure to utilize
natural resources. “They are
getting one-sixth of what is pos-
sible from land as rich as that

Two Visiting Scholars
To Speak On Campus

Two distinguished scholars,
participants in. the Visiting Schol-
ars program, .will appear on
campus next week.

Dr. Douglas V. Steere. Thomas .

Wistar Brown Professor Emer-
itus of philosophy at Haver‘ord
College, will speak at chapel
Tuesday. Dr. Paul B. Weisz. pro-
fessor of biology at Brown Uni-
versity, will lecture Friday at
9:20 a.m. in Dana Science Build-
ing.

Steere has been teaching since
1921 and has held a number of
lecturing positions. He has writ-
ten several books and is cur-
rently chairman of the Friends
World Committee.

Weisz. professor at Brown
since 1947, is a specialist in em-
brvology. morphogenesis and

cytochemistry. He is the author.
of a number of books and tech-
nical papers.

‘Both men will be guests of
the college at luncheons follow-
ing their talks.

Dr. Alvin Boskoff, a soc.ologist
from Emory Un versity, was the
first of the Visiting Scholars on

. RRR arg re

campus this year. Boskoff spoke
in chapel October 12.

The purpose of the Visiting
Scholars program is to provide
better and nationally-known
scholars to speak on the campus.

The college has joined 17 other
area schools in the Piedmont
University Center Program, now
in its fourth year. Sponsored by
the Babcock Foundation. the
program. has its offices in the
Reynolds Estate in Winston-Sa
lem.

"Dr. Paul Marrotte, associate
professor 0 history, is David.
son's representative in the PU-
CP. ‘'The Visiting Scholar is

only one.of the areas of inter. |

ést of the program.” he said. |
There is also a Faculty Summer
Study Program and an educa-
tional film supply, plus others
of equal value, he commented. |

“There are several distinct ad-'
vantages in ‘the program.” Mar.
rotte continued. Schools are able

able to do alone.

PUCP pays half of the speak-
er’s fee and all of his travel ex-
penses and the member school
pays the other half. A repre-
sentative of each school submits
names to be invited. ‘About 50
invitations,”” said Marrotte, ‘‘are
sent out each year, and usually
around 15 scholars accept.”

“Davidson.” added Marrotte,
“of course would have less. trou-
ble than some. other member
schools, but it is true that it is
easier to get scholars to come
for a series of lectures rather
than for a half-day."

them?"

The reason that the study is
being conducted now instead of
in conjunction with the Faculty
Curriculum Evaluation Commit-
tee’s study, is that any bene-
fits which might come from
this independent study could be
initiated before the completion
of the faculty study.

To illustrate what they con-
sider needs to be done, Powell
and Prosser refered to their
own field of interest, political
science.

“There are only two men in
the department and one of these
two spends half of his teaching
‘oad on the Humanities pro-
gram,’ sa:d Prosser. ‘‘There
can be only six courses per
semester in the department.”

Both men said that they would
like to see additional men and
courses added thus giving more
diversity and strength to the
| department,

In Powell's opinion, as a re-
sult of a strengthened depart-
ment, many more __ students
would major in political sci-
ence, particularly those students
Iwho plan to attend law school.

Prosser said that the commit-
tee would also study the stu-
dent-teacher ratio in the social
science departments and com-
pare these with the ‘other de-
partments at Davidson, and with
the social science departments
at Amherst, Williams and other
leading liberal arts colleges.

of the Imperial Valley,” Ratliff
explained.

“If you ask a (Christian) Pak-
istani his religion, he will prob-
ably say ‘Christian’ rather than
name a denomination.” The’ re-
ligions encountered by Ratliff
included Christianity, Islam, and
Parsee, which stems from: Zoro-
astrianism.

laborating on the Parsee re-
ligion, he said that they are
fire worshippers and tend to be
businessmen. One businessman
“even had a Httle bacon under
the counter. if you wanted to
pay about $3 a pound for it.”’
One unusual Parsee practice is
their method of burial. When a
man dies, he is hung in a ‘‘silent
tower’ and vultures remove his
flesh ‘before he is buried.

Concerning the activity of the
church, Ratliff said, ‘*Mission-
aries do not run. Pakistani in-
stiutions. They come at Pakis-
tan’s invitation.” He told of a
plant manager of Corning Glass
who read The Ugly American

FABULOUS DINING

and asked to be sent as a mis-
sionary.

Bribery and other types of
corruption are quite open. Rat-
liff told of his difficulties in get-
ting an import permit, which
was finally obtained through the
influence of a friend of the local
minister.

He also told of openly prefer-
ential treatment given to ath-
letes in school. “They take a
government test... if he’s an
athlete, they add 100 marks.”

chapel speech, Roberts managed
to arouse the excitement that had
faltered in his formal speech.
He repeated his basic conten-
tion that the scientific method
as an objective collection of
facts is more useful to ‘‘compil-
ers of lexicons and telephone di-
rectories’’ than to searchers for
basic truths about the world.

An instinctual feeling of man
for truth was the basis of Rob.
erts’ attack upon neurological
explanations of. the mind.

“Will you admit that the mind
is of a higher level than the
body?"” he queried. ‘Scientists
can't even explain machines in
terms of physics and chemis-
try: they have to use engineer-
ing principles. How then can
they expect to explain the mind
in such terms.”

_ Roberts constructed a_heir-
archy of existence in a man. On

the lowest level: are the chem- .

ical and physical properties. Su-
perimposed on the “boundary”
of these principles are those of
biology which give man life.
Above this level lies conscious.
ness or sentience. Morality is of
yet a higher sphere.

He admitted that some under-

standing of the higher levels is
possible by exploring the inferi-
or levels but he blasted science
for its attempt to understand all
about man in terms of the low-
est orders of existence.

One of the harmful results of
this attempt he contended is the
destruction of the “hero which
will in turn lead to the stagna-
tion of moral and cultural prog-
ress, If there are no heroes, he
said, a culture has no impetus
to improve itself. :

For the past three years, Rob.
erts has been studying episte-
mology with Michael Polanyi.
who gave the basis for much of
Roberts’ thought.

Roberts is a graduate of Geor-
gia Tech, and he has completed
his doctorate in economics re-
quirements at the Unversity of

Virginia where he has held sev-|

eral honorary fellowships.

He has been an exchange stu-
dent to the Soviet Union, studied
in Germany, and was a grad-
uate research student at Berke-
ley where he came to disavow
his earlier belief in socialism.

A former Relms Scholar at
Oxford, Roberts now teaches ec-
onomics at Virginia Tech.

D will, as in the past, be a res-
taurant with waiters and wait-
resses. The only meal which
will be served will be a break-
fast from 2-4 a.m. on Saturday,
Oct. 29.

At other functions throughout
the year there may be increas-

“above and beyond the regular
dining service, a special entity
to aid the Davidson College stu.
dents.”
