Doc Newton is leaving). Swiftly

Friday afternoon that the popular |

the past five years had resigned to

able increase, and there was the
abundance of football material so
lacking at Davidson. , It was just

too much to resist.

Newton came to Davidson an un-
known in coaching circles. In his
five years here he has developed
formidable gridiron machines which
have brought him recognition all
over the eastern United States. It
is with deep regret that we see Doc
go. We are convinced that he and
his football system are destined to
become famous.

The same Conference trouble of
North Carolina having the major-
ity of crack teams seems to exist in
all sports. This allows teams play-
ing almost all their games against
weak opponents to end up higher
in the ranking than far superior
teams which have played against
stronger opposition. If the South-
ern Conference would adopt the
Dickerson system, a point »system
in which points are awarded in re-
lation to the strength of the oppon-
ent, this fault in ranking could eas-
ily be corrected. This would espe-
cially be a boom to Davidson as al-
most all the Wildcat conference
competition is against Big Five op-
ponents:

Two wins last week placed the
Wildcats back in the running for
the Conference cage tournament.
The Red and Black quintet will
have to win three of the five re-
maining games, however; to cinch
a position among the eight teams
at Raleigh. Go get ’em, ’Cats!

Intercollegiate boxing has betéome
so popular at most neighboring
schools that it has taken almost all
the wrestling enthusiasts. Why does
not Davidson have a team in this
sport which ranks close behind foot-
ball in its power to draw specta-
tors? A crack mitt team would eas-
ily pay its own expenses and great-
ly enliven our athletic curricula.
