Student radio draws Spencer's qualified support

By JOHN BOSWELL
Staff Correspondent

Three students are trying to
generate support for a proposed
campus radio station that
would be run totally by stu-
dents.

Seniors Janet Coleman, Da-
vid Sappenfield, and Candy.
Hawks met Wednesday with
college President Samuel Spen-
cer to discuss the possibility of
a campus station.

After the meeting, Coleman
said the President was agree-
able to the idea if enough
students were interested in a

campus station. ‘He gives us .

his blessing,”’ she said. Cole-
man_also said Spencer wanted a
recommendation from Dean of
Students Will Terry stating
that there is adequate student
support for a station before
money is allocated.

Coleman said she would put out
an announcement asking for
students interested in helping
the station to sign up in support
of it. She hopes as many as fifty
people will eventually work for
the station.

In an Open-End meeting Tues-
day morning, Spencer said that
the Trustees of the College have
never been opposed to a campus
station. ‘‘If deemed advis-
able...,"" he said,‘‘the adminis-
tration is authorized to set up a
college station.’’ Spencer also

said the station would be a

student activity, staffed and
operated by students alone.

Spencer believes the station
could be started for a relatively
small cost, “‘The last. surveyors
said..it will only cost several
thousand dollars,‘‘ he said.. At
present, it is not known from
where funds for such a station
would come.

Coleman said the station
would be on a carrier current,

and thus could be received via
electrical outlets on campus
only. With such a small station,
she said, a station license or
operators’ licenses from the
Federal Communications Com-
mission would not be necessary.

Spencer noted that the new
station may have problems
finding room to operate. But

‘Coleman says she believes there

is a room in the basement of
Belk dormitory that could be
used as a studio. This has not
been confirmed with anyone,
she said.

Coleman, Sappenfield, and
Hawks want to make the sta-
tion a ‘‘true student activity,“
Coleman said. She said they

wanted a station run completely
by students: She also said that
WDAYV, the radio station pre-
sently licensed to the College
Trustees, does not provide the
freedom she would like at a
campus station. Working at
WDAV is “more of a job than a
fun thing to do,” she said.
Coleman also said that she
and Sappenfield were not trying
to necessarily be in charge of
the campus station proposal.
She said they felt it was
something they wanted to start.
“We're just doing it to get it
done,‘‘ she said: She also said
they will probably wait until the
station is organized to decide on
the content of programming.

Dean Terry proposes minimum

Honor Code violation sentence

By KEVIN WHEELOCK
Staff Correspondent

All future Honor Code viol-
ators will receive a minimum
one-year suspension from
school if a proposal by Dean of
Students Will Terry passes.

Terry made the proposal last
Sunday at the Judicial Retreat,
which included Honor Council
members, Review Board mem-

bers, the student defense advi-

sor, and the student solicitor.

Violators’ suspensions would
begin immediately after convic-
tion and would have to be
served over consecutive terms,
Terry said. Freshmen would be
exempt from the new policy.

The Student Conduct Council
(SCC) must approve the propo-
sal in order for .it. to go into
effect. A decision is expected
within a week.

Terry gave two reasons for
submitting his proposal. First,
he wantS to eliminate any

punishments for Honor Code
violators. Second, he wants to

establish a uniform, minimum
sanction for all violators:

Presently, sanctions range
from censure to indefinite sus-
pensions, depending on the
circumstances of the individual
case.

Terry admitted that there is a
chance his proposal might make
students reluctant to report

Hobart’s Park feels pinch and support in 2nd year

By ELIZABETH KISS
Staff Correspondent
Hobart’s Park,
fledgling student magazine,
now entering its second year, is
starting off this fall with a goal:
to become a firmly established
publication.

The goal, said Editor-in-Chief

Aida Doss, is attainable. But

there are roadblocks. One such
roadblock is funding. Hobart’s
Park requested $5,000 from the
Activities Tax Council this
year, and received only $2,200.
*‘Which means,"’ said Doss,
“that we'll be operating on an
extremely tight’ budget.’’ It
may also mean that only two
issues will be published this
year, instead of three as origi-
nally: planned.

Submissions are already be-
ing accepted for the first issue,
scheduled for distribution to
students at the beginning of the
winter term. The deadline for
submissions is November 1.

Davidson's *

Last year, Hobart’s Park
appeared only once. “It was
rough getting started,"’ ex-
plained Doss. **There were or-
ganizational problems, and the
printing was not up-to par.”
Student response, however, was
enthusiastic, and the quality of
submissions excellent, said
Doss. Now, with a new printer
and a more experienced staff,
Dogs is optimistic about the
magazine's prospects.

Hobart’s Park was created to
provide an opportunity for stu-
dents to publish all types of
creative work. It prints poetry
and short fiction, political and
scientific essays, travel notes,
artwork and photography. In
addition to, Doss,- the staff
consists of section editors who
have final authority in their
areas of specialization. Editors
are Nancy McNair, poetry and
fiction; Whit Yelverton, photo-
graphy; Gia Partain, art; Andy
Miller and Ann Tutweiler, .es-

says; and production manager,
Marshall Waddell. Doss would
like all these areas well repre-
sented in the magazine. “Some
satire would be great,’” she
added. ‘s

Doss feels that Hobart’s
Purk’s mission is to provide’an
outlet for student writing. She
noted that in the past, The
Davidson Miscellany, the ¢am-
pus’ only other literary maga-
zine, has rarely printed stu-
dents’ work.

“We're hoping for a lot of
support, a lot of submissions,”
said Doss. “This magazine is
what the students make of it.”

This could be a big literary.
year for Davidson, according to
Doss. William Styron, the Pu-
litzer Prize-winning author of
Sophie's Choice anda one-time
Davidson student, will be visi-
ting in October. The annual
Vereen Bell creative writing
contest will be held in the
spring, with the winning entries
appearing in Hobart’s Park. =
