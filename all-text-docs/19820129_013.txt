Titled Earl G, Wooten

“Deliver dialogue,” he asked.

“Two plus two equals four.”

“That's not dialogue. I want blood and guts, you | know.
Realaction.”

I pondered for a while. “Susan, that’s not what I want
from you. I can find any two-bit sleezy slut on the street
whenever | want. Put your clothes back on.” I sighed.

“That'll do, It still isn’t good enough. If you want to deliver

good dialogue you've got to have something important to
say.”

That was just it. I never had anything important to say.

“Let’s see you move.” —

I slid to the side a bit and squatted down.

“Choreograph your motions! I don’t want a jellyfish!”

I stood up, slightly embarrassed, and bent over. I pulled

my head through my armpits with my toes. That ought to

knock his socks off, I thought.

“Not bad. Not bad.” He was impressed. I could tell. He.
was stroking the peach fuzz on his chin, so I know I couldn't

have been all that bad.

“Sing.”

“What?”

“Dammit, I don’t care. You want the part.”

“Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do. ”

“Wrong key: Try again.” |

“Ave verum corpus natum de Maria Virgine.” My*back
was pouring with sweat. That was the hardest line I knew
how to sing. .

“Good. I like Latin.” He peered at me intensely. “Get
another nose,” he said.

I took off my old nose and laid it on the table. It was kind of
pug with nostrils big enough to put my thumb into. I
slapped a narrow nostriled nose onto my face. “Better?”

“Better.” %

“Anything else you want changed?”

“Don’t rush. me. Hmmm. No. I think that’s all. Next!”

“Wait! Don’t I get the part? What about me?”

“I don’t know, ‘kiddo. The world may not be ready for
your type just yet. No one will know how to raise you. You'll
be a misfit in society.”

“But you've got to give me a change. I can fit in
somewhere. Just try me. You'll see.’

He signed deeply. “But you’re so...so..

“Different.” I smiled when I supplied the word. He looked
at me and he began to smile too.

“All right. You get the part.”

“Goody! When do I start?”

“Now! Go to black!”

Someone slapped me in my rear. “Ow!” I yelled, but all I
heard was the piercing wailof a newborn baby.

The Designer

The mother spider spins her web |
Of silk'and satin
Golden thread...

With strings that touch every branch;

Sent that lure the hungry flies.

A strong and sticky silver line
Numbs the captured prey with shine.
They dangle in cozy grey suits
Drained of their j juice.
