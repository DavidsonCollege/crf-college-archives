Blinkhorn, Brown, Purcell leave

Cats lament leadership loss.

Baseball season has ended for
the 1978 Wildcat baseball team
and the season’s end marks the
end of three seniors’ college’
careers.

Rick Blinkhorn, Stan Brown,
and Tim Purcel) played their
final game this past week for
the Cats. Their graduation will
hurt the Cats since all three
played crucial roles in the
baseball program.

Co-Captain Tim Purcell has
pitched four years for the Cats,
two of those years as a reliever
and the last two years as a
starter.

Purcell served as the ‘‘ace’”’
for the Cats this year, pitching
a 2-6 record this season and
finished with an ERA of 4.87.
Next year the versatile Purcell
plans to use another of his
talents by singing professional-
ly for a band in Atlanta.

Stan Brown has started for
three years in the Cats outfield.
His sophomore year he started
at right field and last year he
moved to center field where he
has impressed teammates, op-
ponents and scouts. In the field,
Brown’ s quickness allows him

ns All-S.C..

to cover a lot of the outfield and
to make many catches that a
slower fielder could not.

In addition, Brown has a
tremendously strong ‘‘rifle-
arm, "’ indeed, one that many
believe could contend with any
college player in the nation.
Brown threw out nine opposing
baserunners this year and re-
spect for his arm has prevented
many other runners from even
trying to advance.

In addition to his fielding,
Brown anchored the Cats hit-
ting attack by pounding a .300
career batting average for his
four years with the Cats. This
year he hit .346 and led the Cats
in homeruns with six.

- Throughout this season,
Brown has been watched with
delighted interest by numerous
professional scouts. Next year
Brown will be in law school at
Vanderbilt and would like to
take spring term off to play pro
baseball. His plans depend on
the approaching baseball draft
that will determine whether
Brown will be signed or not. At
present his chances appear
quite good.

Co-Captain Rick Blinkhorn

has started at second base for
three years for the Cats. In his
sophomore year, he led the Cats
with a .354 hitting average and
was voted second team all-
Southern Conference. This year
“Blink” hit .300 for the Cats.
Blinkhorn’s greatest contribu-
tion to the Davidson baseball
program lies within something
that statistics do not measure.
For instance, Coach Palmer
Muench says about Blinkhorn,

‘‘He has been a leader in
recruiting, in running practices,
and in pulling the team together
during games. His good atti-
tude has added tremendously to
the team.’’ Next year, Blink-
horn hopes to be in medical
school.

Davidson baseball has ben-
efitted greatly from these three
seniors’ achievements and con-
tributions. Their loss will be felt
quite deeply since they led the
Cats in statistics, experience
and leadership. As Coach
Muench explains, ‘““You don’t
lose three important players,
like Brown, Blinkhorn and Pur-
cell have been, without feeling
the effects of their loss from the
program.”

"Golfers surprise competition

The Wildcat golf team re-
turned from the Southern Con-
ference-championship with a
sixth place finish in an eight
team field. The 54-hole tourna-
ment was held at the Country
Club of South Carolina in
Florence. The windy and rainy
conditions made the long layout
very difficult.

Freshman L.D. Simmons led
a Wildcat rally the final day
with a superb one over par 73.
The golfers passed both West-
ern Carolina and The Citadel
the last day and avoided a

possible last place finish. Sim-
mons had a three-day total of
232 that placed him in the top
ten individually and subse-
quently earned him all-confer-
ence honors.

Juniors Sollie Foy, Joe Da-
vis, and Jim Heard joinged
sophomore Scott Gilmore and
freshman Bill Baird in rounding
out the six-man Wildcat squad.

Appalachian State captured
the team title by five shots over

over rapidly fading pre-tourna-

Greg French and VMI’s Jeb

Green with totals of 223.

The Wildcats were obviously!
disappointed with their showing
in the final tournament of their
season. They had entertained
realistic hopes of cracking into
the top four. As Jim Heard
aptly stated, ‘‘Our effort to
bring it around on the back
came up short.”

The addition of more state
schools such as UTC, Marshall
and East Tennessee State will
make it more difficult for Dav-
idson to compete successfully in
golf as well as other sports.
However, the team remains
optimistic about the future.

This spring the team received
invitations to many outstand-
ing tournaments featuring the
nation’s top-ranked teams. Al-
though this was often very
humbling, the valuable exper-
ience gained will certainly help
prepare the team for serious
title hopes in future Southern
Conference championships.

Record year ends

By DAVID REICH
Staff Writer

Davidson’s tennis team com-
pleted its season Saturday with
a fourth place finish in the
Southern Conference Tourna-
ment. Although the Davidson
netters were disappointed with
the tournament results, Coach
Jeff Frank emphasized that,
“This season’s 24-5 record re-
presents a great season in which
we won more matches than any
tennis team in Davidson his-
tory.”

Clearly, Frank was pleased
with the team’s play through-
out the regular season. He
emphasized that the Cats
played up to their potential in
almost every match. He attri-
buted this fact to strenuous
conditioning, senior leadership,
and overall team effort.

Frank was also pleased with
the overall team play in the
conference tournament. He sta-
ted that, ‘‘Although we lost
some hard fought matches ear-
ly, we probably could not have
played better than we did. The
competition at the conference
this year was the toughest it
has ever been. Between UTC,
Furman, Appalachian, The Cit-
adel, and ourselves, all the
draws were difficult to say the
least.”’

Even though the competition

was fierce, several Wildcat net-
ters did excel in individual play.
In singles, Chip Bondurant
ended an impressive regular
season by capturing the South-
ern Conference Championship
in the number two spot. Bon-
durant defeated McWaters of
The Citadel in the semi-tinais
7-5, 7-6, and Davis Babb of
Appalachian 7-6, 2-6, 7-5 in the
finals. As his doubles partner,
freshman Jay Gepfert, empha-
sized, ‘‘Bondurant’s play in the
match with Babb’exemplifies
his gutsy, play all year. He
fought off three match. points
with aggressive play and just
beat the guy mentally.”

John Trout and Steve Hol-
man also played well at their
respective singles positions.
Trout finished third in the
tournament at the number five
spot, and Holman finished third
at the number six spot.

In doubles play, Bondurant
and Gepfert teamed to win the
championship at the number
one spot. They defeated Fur-
man’s number one doubles first
round, Dan West and Babb of
Appalachian in the semi-finals,
and The Citadel’s tough number
one doubles in the finals, 7-5,
6-2.

Looking ahead toward next
season, Frank will obviously
miss the consistent play of
Bondurant, as well as the other
seniors who graduate this year.
He stated, ‘‘It’s impossible
to replace Mike Barnhill, Bon-
durant, Holman, Brian Cooper,
Brian Berry, Steve Johnson,
and Stewar’ 3oswell without a
loss of experience, but we do

.have several recruits who

should help the team next year.
John Carlton; Nevins Todd,
Jeff Wall and Nicholas Viest all
are promising players. They
should add‘to our present
nucleus to form another. suc-

_cessful team.”
