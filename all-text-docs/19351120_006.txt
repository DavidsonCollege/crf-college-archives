Sport Staccato

Dunlap brothers. We wouldn't attempt
to verify the rumor, but it so happened
that one of the Dunlap boys was carried
out of the game.

There is a definite rivalry be-
tween Davidson and Duke, al-
though it must be admitted that
in latter days the Wildcats have
been taking themselves more seri-
ously on the eve of the annual
Duke game. At least the Dukes
haven't taken themselves or their
opponents seriously enough to go
in for mussing up football players,
and if any unnecessary rough-
ness occurs in Saturday’s contest
the chances are the Blue Devils
will be on the receiving end.
Those of us who have witnessed
Wade-coached teams can and will
vouch for this in advance of the
game.

Stamey fill up space in his column, but

is, course, essential
when sports news becomes so scarce that
one has to resort to mud slinging, then
we suggest that he copy Mother Goose
rhymes.
Not only was the Duke game this year
a clean one but after the final whistle
there were a number of Davidson and
- Juke men down in the dressing room
who laughed and joked in the best ot
terms. Even “Doc” Newton and Wallace
\\ade were having their “bull session.”
The only ones to suffer injuries as far
as we can determine was Davidson but
we certainly do not believe Duke was
laying for the ‘Cats and
ception of this remarkable gentleman of
the press, we are pretty sure that no one

with the ex-

thought the 'Cats were laying for the
Dukes.

“No. sir, there’s nothin’ sissy about
that game” spectators were heard to re-
mark after the soccer classic this past
week with High Point College. In fact
never has such an exhibition of legal
kicking, shinnying, tackling, jumping,

sliding, ete., been staged within the con
fines of Davidson College since its be-
ginning.

a goal.

Charlie Bixler, reputed the

“best individual on the team” used
his football experience to a good
advantage in his blocking and
kicking.

Haake (goal tender and bran-
ded by some as “local king of
swat’), Armstrong and Kestler
led the list of minor stars.

The score tells the tale; the winners
held the upper hand throughout both
games. Again “The Goon” played a prom-
inent part in the victory, smashing his

way through his opponents for many
points.
The senior team was captained by

M. J. Barnett, while A. M. Faison head-
ed the centennials’ team. Yates Faison led
the sophomores, and freshmen
R. O. Lang to the captaincy.

you can, having the most friends, and
putting up the hardest fight you can in
your athletics—those are the things that
count. Look at yourself, he said, and see
what is the matter with you—why don't
you make friends? Why aren't: you at-
tractive? Are you the strongest spirit in
your group? Another thing that is good
to work on is one’s speaking voice and
ability to read aloud.

One of the most important things is
to develop and show dependability. If

you take a job, such as teaching a Sun-|*

lay School class, or helping in a church,
stick with it, and be dependable. Such a
regular contact with another group of
people, gained in this way, may prove to
be one of the most’ valuable contacts
made in all one’s time at college.

The speaker closed with the exhorta-
tion to “Make yourself count. Make your
hall a better hall, your room a_ better
room, and your roommate a better man.”

Scottish minister’s book, “The Life of
God in the Soul of Man.”

In conclusion Dr. Sweets spoke of the
life of Jesus Christ, the life loving serv-
ice for others, as the model of the per-
fect life, and expressed the plea ‘‘Pattern
your life after Jesus Christ.”

Roberson was the mainstay of the Ca- |

time. Beard and Clark were nearly
active in the V. M. I. backtield. Pittman
and Lafferty starred for Davidson in
running. Yarborough and Armfield were
also conspicuous in the backfield. The
Red and Black line capitalized on the
errors of the opposition, but the David-
son men carrying the ball did well, too.
The rain made it difficult to pass and
punt. Fumbles took a heavy toll; penal-
ties were few. However, the first downs
favored V. M, I. nine to six. The 14-6
