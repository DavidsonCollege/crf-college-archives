Hallowed Hollow Howls At

Homecoming Celebrations

By RONALD WILSON ,

Each year, during the month of
October, a metamorphic evolution
takes place on the premises of our
long-suffering institution, permeat-
ing the air with the sound of peo-
ple busily working, making plans,
borrowing money, and in general
creating confusion and chaos.

Sounds of primitive construction
pierce the autumn air around *fra-
ternity row; lights are burning
night and day for the workers in
the Student Union; the football
team strains mightily on the prac-
tice field, and the alumni office
grinds out volumes of propaganda
for the Old Grads, swearing that
Davidson is as economically sound
as Fort Knox, but $50,000 more is
needed for grass seed ‘to plant in
‘front of the new building—all these
frantic happenings bespeak the one
function which rouses our institu-
lion to the level of other colleges:
Homecoming.

There will be impassioned
oratory at the dedication of the
Student Union; there will be
impassioned oratory at the bar-
becue luncheon, exhorting old
and young alike to press for-
ward in the meretorious serv-
ice of D.C., and there will be

THE FREE LANCE...

It is to say that before anyone
despair of his having gotten any
real foundation for living in the
contemporary world, he think what
he’s getting here that’s not offered
at many other educational insti-
tutions,

It would be foolish, however,
to settle for less than perfec-
tion, and so we and many like
us will continue to bitch and
criticise the parts of Davidson
which are yet open to improve-
ment and these are legion.

We thought, however, that the
Homecoming good fellows might
mix a bit of reflection in with their
jollity. It is always good to wonder
why one is what one is and what
forces contributed to the end pro-
duct.

WILDCAT OF WEEK...

hopefuls. Not only was Coach Dole
well pleased with his running pet-
formance but also had high praise
for his fine offensive blocking.

As a freshman last season, the
S* 8”, 165-pounder, from Rome, Ga.,
tore through nine games in tough
Southern Conference play to rack
up 437 yards in 80 carries for an
average of 5.5 yards per carry and
lead all Wildcat backs in the run-
ning department. This, for a
freshman and on a team that won
but one contest in nine tries, was
nothing short of sensational, and
that is the very word to describe
the play of this little package of
running dynamite.

SIGS REMAIN...
(Continued from Page Three)
Pikas 19; Phi Delts 12
In the absence of their regular
sparkplug, Jim Smith, the Pikas
used sophomore Billi Hanna who
hooked up with ace receiver Joe
Pharr to bring home a 19-12 win
over the Phi Delts in near freez-
ing weather last Monday. Leading
the Phi Delt effort were Bill Nel-

son and Don Lazenby.
SPEs 26; SAE 7

SPE backfielder Horace Ball
joined forces with receiver “Wea-
sel” Clark to rout the SAEs 26-7.
The SPE defensive squad showed
up well in the contest. Steve Nor-
ton and Ray Lilly stood out for

impassioned, and harshly taint-
ed, oratory after the game in
case of a miscarriage of justice
on the field of play.

But paramount in the minds of
many will be the apptarance on the
Campus of a species completely
foreign to our way of life. Here
at Hallowed Hollow. the curri-
culum offers no courses in the fas-
cinating study of the opposite
fgender, and opportunities for out-
side educztion are crassly limited

Three times a year, however, the
luminaries and the lesser satellites
of the Administration absolve us
thoroughly and then permit us to
blemish the sanctity of the school
and import fair damsels from the
surrounding countryside for a
weekend. Amidst great expecta-
tions, coupled with some few last-
minute tribulations, the first holi-
day has arrived. The lavish accom-
modations of Duke and Rumple
have been prepared with consum-
mate care and skill for the awaited
influx of femininity.

Ladies, we salute you! Never
has so much been expected of
so few by so many.

OLD GYM CHANGES...

building which had been the scene
of many thrilling athletic contests
had not passed out of the picture
completely.

Almost immediately the long
process of tearing the inside out of
the structure began. When finally
only the. walls remained, work on
the student union began.

At present, though the work is
not entirely completed and there
are some finishing touches to be
applied, dedication ceremonies will
go ahead as planned tomorrow.

»More than enough has _ been done
20 that alumni, students and visi-
tors will be albe to tell what the

‘new union is going to be like.

Though the old gym as such is
sone, it will be a long time be-
fore it will be forgotten by the
many alumni who played there, and
satvin the stands watching several
generations of Davidson teams in
action.

alumni whose money and efforts
made possible the erection of the
original building will be placed at

termined, location on the campus.

Pi Kapps 20; ATOs 6

The fine efforts of Tom Hancock
and Ben Jones coupled with a fine
performance by the entire Pi Kapp
squad brought the Pi Kapps a
20-6 win over the ATOs. Freshmen
Phil Koonce and Johnny Parker
led the way for the ATOs.

Phi Deits 18; Phi Gama 12

The steady backfield work of
Don Lazenby and the fine pass
receiving of Scott Reams brought
the Phi Delts an 18-12 win over
the Phi Gams. Watt Moore and
freshman Buddy Liles led the way
for the Phi Gams.

Charley Harrell and Brooks

Last year with Presbyterian

so reasonably sure of a victory,
that he “predicted” one. Neediess

as the weather did several years
before.

another loss would be just about
as useful: as some deepfreezes in

remains that It long years of
Homecoming losses are on our
record, This is the year to stop
it. This should be the team to do
the’ trick, The team that could
explode with anything should be
teady to fire on Furman. Davidson
and every alumnus is pulling for
them to do it,

here (he did at Oak Ridge) but
this would involve grading and
possibly alter some students’ con-
fidence in him, The whole point is
Mr. Smith wants to be our friend
—talk to him two minutes and you
will realize this.

I was in his already “plush” of-
fice (there’s no other word for it)
smoking a cigar he forced on me in
celebration of his third child, a
daughter, born last Thursday.
Gradually the familiar “Davidson-
graduate-rcturned” story unfolded.

Shaw's a Mt. Olive native who
took up magic about the time most
of us take-up building blocks. He
became a magician’s helper and
learned the trade well enough to
work his way through D.C, in 1939.

After a year at Oak Ridge he
returned here as Y secretary for
three years, then toured overseas
with a service entertainment group
as em-cee and magician. Thirty
months and 27 countries later he
was released, studied at UNC, then
became commandant (dean) at Oak
Ridge (for 4 years).

Then the trustees here thought
it advisable to have a_ student
union director who could double

as a Student activities helper and
general Dorothy Dix. Shaw was
the man.

Then, just when the cigar smoke
was getting the best of me, he
grabbed me for the grand tour.
We went through kitchens, bowling
alleys, auditoriums, faculty rooms
¢kidney room) and saw things
you'll see tomorrow. It's fabulous
and Shaw had one request: “Tell
the students not to miss the dedi-
cation Saturday.”

. I left, still dizzy from the whirl-
wind tour. Or maybe it was the
cigar.

Miss Emmons has gained a wide
following principally throughout
the East and Midwest for her out-
standing talent,

A former soloist with the Rob-
ert Shaw Chorale, she has also
sung numerous opera roles and was
the soprano soloist for the third
Sigmund Romberg Album. She re- | |
turned from Europe last spring
after studying for a year on a[-
Fullbright Scholarship.

She has also been heard as
soloist with the CBS Sym-
phony Orchestra on several
coast-to-coast radio broad-
casts and on CBS's “Invitation
to Music” program.

The young soprano received two
of her biggest rewards in the last
month when she won the Marion
Anderson award of $1,000 for out-
standing young singers and was
chosen by Lauritz Melchoir to be
his guest artist on tour for the
coming season.

Her program Friday night will
include a group of American com-
positions, operatic arias, as well as
popular and classical selections.

Students may now get the proofs
to their annual pictures. These
proofs are arriving every day from
Raleigh.

Mitchell Patton requests that all
students go to see their proofs one
week after the day they were taken.

This year each student is getting
four proofs instead of the two as
in years past, and there isa spe-
cial rate for extra orders, with the
assurance that the pictures will be
delivered on or around December 1.

Picture proofg may be seen
in the same room as the one
where the pictures were taken
starting Monday. The hours of
Mr. Andy Law of Smith and
Waller are from ten o'clock to
five-thirty.

It is requested that students try
to ste their proofs at times other
than right after chapel. Monday
and Tuesday are the last days for
those supposed to see proofs this
week, .

Students not selecting the desired
proof will be forced to rely on the
judgment of the annual staff in
selecting the best possible proof.

This past Tuesday night the
YMCA cabinet held its regular
semi-monthly mecting and: fotlow-
ing a devotional by Bob Mitchell
focused its main attention to select-
‘ing several projects for considera-
tion in the Christmas Gift Fund.

One of the new features of the
gift fund is that the student body
will have the final word on this
year’s project. Ernest Barry, chair-
man of the. gift fund post, has in-
vestigated approximately twenty.
five possible causes and projects,
ranging from local to international
levels, and has laid these projects
before the cabinet.

Rey. E. Stanley Jones, noted
author and missionary, presented
in a clear and vivid manner the
challenge of Christian World Mis-

He centered his informal talk
around his recent experiences in
India and Japan, and told of the
present situation and possibilities
in both countries, including the
present threat of Communism and
the urgent need for a revolutionary
Christianity.

Set To Play

Buddy Morrow will be lead-
ing his RCA Victor recording
dance band from the bandstand
of Johnston Gymnasium as the
Annual Davidson Homecoming
dances begin tonight at 9 p.m.

Featured with Morrow will be
the rising young male vocalist
Frankie lester together with pretty
Joan Hovis, Morrow’s enchanting
girl singer.

The Morrow orchestra is com-
paratively young as dance bands
go, but has already made a name
for itself in the entertainment
world. Last year disc jockeys all
across the country voted Buddy's
band the most promising band in
the enantry by a wide margin.

In his brief career as an or-
chestra leader, Morrow has led
his band in some of the top
dancing and entertainment
spots in the land. Among these
are the famous Hollywood Pal-
ladium and the Steel Pier at
Atlantic City, New Jersey.
Morrow played at the latter
location during the recent Miss
America Contest.

Several of his recordings for
RCA Victor have reached the
best seller lists. These include:
“Solo,” “Rose, Rose, I Love You,”
and “Everything I have Is Yours.”

Morsow has attended the
juiliard School of Music in
New York City. After having
played in high school orches-
tras and combos, Morrow had
also been featured with the
Yale Collegians as a trombone
soloist. Paul Whiteman of-
fered him a job with his re-
nowned orchestra while he was
at Julliard, and Buddy ac-
cepted.

Subsequently, he played his
trombone in the dance orchestras
of such famous bandsmen as Eddie
Duchin, Artie Shaw, Vincent Lo-
pez, and Tommy Dorsey.

Then came the war and Mor.
row entered the U. S. Navy for
a three-year hitch,

Following the cessation of hos-
tilities and his discharge, he joined
Jimmy Dorsey's band.

In 1950 Buddy signed a record-
ing contract with RCA Victor. He
and his band, which was then
strictly a recording outfit, made
several records of note, the first
of which was “Rio Rita,” followed
soon after by “Solo.”

It was not until August of 1951
that Morrow started rehearsing his
band for its first tour of all the
leading dance spots from coast to
coast.°

Political Note

Wonder where the Davidsonian
stands on national politics? It is
planned for the next issue of the
paper to contain an extra page de-
voted entirely to politics. This is
being prepared by students, faculty
and the two principal parties.

list to somewhere near five causes,
will present these remaining proj-
ects before the student body in a
chapel program. Following further
discussion, the student body will
vote to decide which of the proj-
ects it wishes to support.
Socials Planned

Bob Henry, social chairman, re-
ported that Miss Eunice’ James of
the Charlotte YWCA has sched-
uled a barbecue and square dance
for October 28, to which she has
invited about thirty Davidson boys.

The following night, October 29,
the nurses of Mercy Hospital have
invited twenty-five to fifty stu-
dents from Davidson as guests at
a dance. Henry also outlined plans
for Flora MacDonald-Davidson day
on November 8.

Scout Report

Mike York reported that at
present there are four scout units
functioning in Davidson and Cor-
nelius—-two cub scout units and
two boy scout units. As progress
is made in these units, further stu-
dents will be utilized to answer
the challenge of leadership and
responsibility with young boys.

Homer Sparks called for more
student support of boys’ work here
in Davidson and urged that all boys
interested in helping with Gra-Y
clubs to contact him.
