GYM TEAM TO MAKF TRIP.

The Gymnasium team is planning to
leave Thursday for Kings Mountain.
An exhibition will be given there at the
celebration held on the anniversary of
the Battle of Kings Mountain. The
team will probably return Thursday
night.

The team is rather small as several of
the best men left last vear. There is.
however. a lot of fresh material and
with hard work Davidson ought to be
able to uphold her reputation in having
one of the best teams in the country.
Plans have heen made to order new ap-
paratus. Other trips and probably a
meet will be realized during the vear.

A. C. Woods. L. K. Boggs and F. M.
Mitchell have just come out of the In-
firmary, after short spells of illness.

Mott, just befére the meetings began at
Chapel Hill last winter, said he consid
ered the interviews with the leaders as

We have a rare privilege in having: se
many men strong in Christian character,
and rich in expertence, to whem we may
go for help and guidance ins anv diff
culty, whether mental, moral, or spirit
ual,

Tt is necessary that all do their part in
order that the meetings may he at suecess.
Fach man should be very earnest in
prayer that God may give him a new
vision of life and help him to follow
more closely in’ the footsteps of the
Master. And day by dav as we go
about on the campus we should speak to
the fellow who needs our help. Men.

Tigers Are Again Tied

By Fetzer’s Machine

Red and Black Repeats Feat of Last
Year in Saturday’s Game.

By recovering a fumble and scoring
through an open field. Adams — saved
Clemson trom defeat at the hands of
Davidson on Riggs Field, Saturday, Oc-
tober 2. With the exception af this
scare Clemson never threatened — the
Davidson goal, and the only chance the
Tigers had for tallying yas ins an at-
tempred drop kick from the 30-sard line,
which was blocked and recovered by the
Red and Black.

‘Vhe intensely hot weather told heav-
ily on both teams and was especially trv-
ing on the Davidsonians, as they were
considerably outweighed by the Aggies
and the latter could make more frequent
substitutions,

tn the first quarter Davidson received.
Keesler cauelit the, kick off and ran for
20 vards, fumbling as he was tekled.
Clemson recovered but was unable to
gain. “The hall see-sawed in the middle
of the field the rest of the quarter,

Tn the second quarter, by a pood re-
turn of Clemson's punt, line bucks, and
end runs. Davidson tavice made downs,
On the Tigers’ 45 vard Vine the Red
and Black again fumbled, Adams recov-
ering for Clemson and with no one he-
tween hind and goal posts ran the fifty
vards for the first touchdawn, Clemson
failed to kick goal.

In the third quarter Keesler received
the kick off and with magnificent inter
ference ran through the entire Clemson
team and was tackled on the 2 vard line.
Laird easily crossed the line on the next
plav. Davidson failed to kick goal.

During this anarter Davidsan twice
suceessfully. worked the forward pass.
threatening the ‘Tigers’ goat. Bue the
third pass was intercepted and the Ag-
ties punted out of danger. Davidson
was forced to punt. With a good return
the “Vigers brought the ball te the “Par
Heel wevard line, “Vheir drop kick was
blocked, White recovering for David-
son.

Phe fourth quarter Davidson threat-
ened the Tiger goal when Lawson twice
drove center for 15 vards. “The forward
pass was aeain intercepted and — the
“Tiers” goal saved.

For Clemson the work of Me Millan,
Harris and Magill owas pood. For
Davidson White plaved excellent ball.
The big center was in the game at all
times. breaking «up the interference and
capturing the Clemson backfield before
it had left its position. Black's defensive
work was of the stellar kind, and he
was alsa a consistent ground — gainer.
Lawson and Keesler both ran the team
well at quarter, The line-up:
