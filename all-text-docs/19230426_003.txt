And comes, on summons, to the floor?
The jaunty, jolly Sophomore.

| Who has the time of his young life
, Steeped in the college life and lore,
| Whose memories cling forevermore?
\ The apt, absorbent Sophomore.

Who is it, then, we toast tonight,
| Whose virtues laud, whose faults ignore,
On whose brave band our plaudits pour?

Pitched JPN

By BILL HESTON

The Peanut Parcher, after interviewing
all the important millionaires in the U. S.
offers the following principles which will
make any man who observes them a mil-
lionaire : 4
1. Arise at 6 o'clock every morning.
Take a cold shower.

Pay all debts promptly.

Take exercise.

Have an uncle die somewhere and be-
tueath you a million dollars.

Prof. (in class)—What have you prepar-
ed for today?

John Simpson—For the .worst.

Ted Jones has just finished composing a
new song hit for Ben Turpin entitled “East
is West.” Another one of his latest hits is
‘I Ordered Nails and In-come Tax.”

George McCutcheon (to druggist)—Can
you recommend something to keep my hair
in?

Druggist—Why, most any-kind of a candy
or cigar box would do,

It isn’t wise to tell everything you know,
but some people can’t help it if they talk at
all.

The invitation offered by the pastor last
Sunday to those “behind the scenes” was

Jack Austin—You know, last year the doc-
tor told me if I didn’t stop smoking I'd be
fecbleminded.

Shorty Howell—Why didn’t you stop.
WHY “FOR”?
Hurd—Wotcha gonna do this summer?

Price—Work for my dad.

Hurd—You used an extra word.

Prof—Your themes should be written so
that even the most stupid of people can un-
derstand them.

Walthall (humbly)—Yes sir.
dont’ you understand, sir?

Soph—What makes the light so pale?
Fresh—Oh, it was out all night.

“Yes, honey, I believe you.”
“But, Izzy, do you shave yourself?”
“Sure.”
“I thought so, it’s the roughest—”
And now poor Izzy Thames is wondering
why she stopped so suddenly.

“I certainly am absorbing a lot of know-
ledge,” murmered the student as he erased
the algebra problem from the blackboard. ~

As the poets say:
Some are born great,
Some achieve greatness,
While some grate upon us.

According to the record this is the first
time that Davidson has ever met Trinity
in an intercollegiate debate. However, for
many years the rivals have met each other
in various intercollegiate contests. So far
this year most of the athletic events have
gone to Trinity, but the Wildcat debating
squadron is determined to secure revenge on
Friday night.

The following was overheard during one
of the recent games on Sprunt Field.
