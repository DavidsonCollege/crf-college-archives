DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

VOLUME ONE NO. ONE

RARE BOOK ROOM~—In a decision
handed down this Monday, Jesus Christ
The Nazarene, founder of Christianity and
spiritual leader of nearly two billion
people, was judged unqualified for admit-
tance to the Board of Trustees of
Davidson College. Despite His above-av-
erage credentials, Christ failed to meet the
Board’s long-standing Christian member-
ship requirement.

“Jesus certainly had the potential to be
a strong candidate, don’t get us wrong,”
commented Board member and spokes-
person Peter Flank ’69. “But the rules are
there for a reason, and I’m sorry, but
Christ is simply not a Christian.”

Christ, redeemer of souls and giver of
life, was born to God and the Virgin Mary
in the town of Bethlehem in the year 1,
whereupon He was raised in the Jewish
tradition. Though He serves as both
founder and central figure of Christianity,
at no point in His life did Christ actually
convert to the Christian religion. Little did
He realize that religious affiliation would
be a major factor in the Board of Trustees
member selection process when He ap-
plied last month.

“I say unto you, this sucks,” Christ
commented.

Since its inception, the Davidson Board
of Trustees has adhered to a strict re-
quirement that all trustees be “acting
members of the Christian Church.” At
least 16 must be members of the Presby-
terian Church (USA), but the rest may
belong to other denominations. While
bylaws for membership do not specifically
forbid the selection of deities, they do for-

U-Haul hits €u hall

WHOOPS: Davidson’s overburdened Main Street traffic patterns
took a turn for the worse this weekend when a U-Haul hit Eu
Hall. The accident has been blamed on inept driving and irony.

school, or really anything about law,” said
Denson, “but I figured, man, I better do
something.”

Denson made the career decision Sun-
day night in his dorm room, after first
ruling out the possibilities of med school,
engineering school, or just getting a job.
He then submitted an application to East
Albuquerque School of Law, which he
filled out on-line.

Oddly, Denson’s liberal arts education
has not seemed to present him with any
true sense of vocational direction.

“TI guess I was absent the day they ex-
plained what you can do with an English
major, because I honestly have no freak-
ing idea,” Denson said.

“I’ve had some people tell me you can
do ‘anything’ and others say you can do
‘nothing.’ I really wish you could just do
‘something.””-

If accepted into law school, Denson will
effectively buy himself another three
years before he is once again forced to
think about what he wants to do with his
life. In this sense, the option is welcome
relief.

“My mom says you can do a lot witha
law degree, like go into business or real-
estate or whatever,” Denson continued.

“I just hope I don’t actually have to be-
come a lawyer, because I’ve heard that’s
miserable.” :

Ever non-plus, Denson is now focusing
on taking the LSATs, so he can send his
scores along to East Albuquerque.

“I hope it works out,” he said.

“But who knows. I suppose if all else
fails I can just become'a college profes-

Honor Council
rep still visiting
freshmen girls’
hall

CANNON—Despite the fact that his
official duties as Honor Council represen-
tative for third Cannon were fulfilled long
ago, Council member Warren Ennis ‘05 is
still making frequent visits to the fresh-
men girls’ hall.

“T want them to know how important
the Code is to our school and our way of
life,” said Ennis, who lovingly refers to
third Cannon residents as “my girls.” He
went on to explain the myriad benefits of
the code, which include self-scheduled
exams, community bikes, and the gener-
ous free-entry to dorm rooms granted to
all students, male or female, by unlocked
doors.

Yet, despite his altruistic intentions,
Ennis’ continued presence has raised
some concern with area hall counselors: “I
know he says he’s just trying to do his
job,” said Amy Harrison ’05, “but that
took a whole of five minutes five months ~
ago. I think the girls know by now what
the Honor Code is and how it works. I’m
not so sure Warren’s intentions are all
that ‘honorable,’ if you catch my drift.”

Third Cannon residents have also
voiced some curiosity. “I understand the
Honor Code is really vital at Davidson and

Class participation |
grade entirely arbitrary,
professor admits

CHAMBERS--Ever have the sinking
feeling that 10 to 15% ‘class participa-
tion’ grade can’t be anything other than
random, un-representative, and utterly
subjective?

You're right. Just ask visiting profes-
sor of anthropology John Holt.

“I won't tell any lies
about it,” said Holt, a
UNC grad who has taught
at Davidson for the past
year-and-a-half. “When
grade time comes rolling
around, assessing that
thing is the easiest part of
my job. I just slap ‘em on
there like parking tick-
ets.”

According to Holt, the
class participation grade
is more often than not an
entirely arbitrary assess-
ment of a student's effort, focusing less
on actual class participation, and more
on general, unsubstantiated prefer-
ences. To expect teachers to assess the
grade in the unprejudiced spirit in

which most students interpret it, Holt
explained, is simply unrealistic.

“Ok, let’s think about this logically,”
said Holt, leaning back in his $17 Office
Depot desk chair. “Let’s say I’m teach-
ing four courses here a semester. That’s
30 kids a course, which is like, what,
120 kids total? Sure, I'll
probably be able to re-
member their names by
the end of the semester,
maybe even a few things
about them. But are you
honestly going to sit
there and tell me I’m
supposed to keep track of
what each and every
damn person said in ev-
ery hour of class? That’s
crap, and don’t be fooled
by any professor who
tells you otherwise.”

“Hell, and I’m young,” continued
Holt. “Do you think some of these octo-
genarian profs stumbling around here
