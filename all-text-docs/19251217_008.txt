Dr. Martin has recently purchased sev-
feral hundred dollars worth of flowers
land shrubbery for the beautification of
the campus. These plants came from one
}of the best nurseries in the state, and
‘should soon develop into very beautiful
plants. - The president and members of
the faculty have long felt the great need
| for such as this, and are proud to have
| accomplished their aim.

The shrubbery is of many different va-
rieties, and when all is in full bloom will
present a gorgeous mixture of brilliant
colors, The plants have been’ carefully
| set out by the laborers ofthe college, and
the work supervised by the college en-
|gineer. Almost all of the shrubbery has
| been planted around the new Chambers
building, and as soon as a stand of grass
| is procured, it will show up as one of the
| prettiest buifaings in the state. The

| shrubbery completely surrounds the

| building, occupying some three or four

feet immediately adjacent to the building.

i is earnestly hoped that the students
will co-operate in every way to give the
| Shrubbery a fair chance to develop,

divided into three classes. Those of the
| first class, which is by far the largest, uni-
| formly employ in all these words the sound
jcalled standard. Members of the

second

class, which is the smallest, with equal regu- ,
|larity substitute dialectic ou for standard ou!
jin the words given. The third, and from the |

| standpoint of typical eastern Virginia speech,
jthe most interesting class includes those
| who pronounce about, house, and out with
dialectic ou, and crowd, how, loud, with
standard ou.

This seeming inconsistency invites study.
Careful and prolonged observation, and the
application of tests to a number of eastern
Virginians have proved that members of
class three unconsciously obey the following
law:
diphthongal ou is given the dialectic sound
represented by (pu) when the diphthong is
immediately followed in the same syllable
by the sound of a voiceless consonant; but
under all other conditions standard ou (au)
is employed. Examples of words in which
dialectic ou is heard are about, doubt, trout;
examples of words in which standard ou is
heard are bough, how, foul, loud.

Tests indicate that the large majority of
eastern Virginians belong to class three, but

ginia peninsula, notably in James City, county
and elsewhere in the state.

The second of the two distinctive sounds
in the speech of eastern Virginians is that of
i in such words as bright, like, and price. In
typical eastern Virginia speech diphthonged
iis given the dialectic sound represented by
(pi) under two conditions: (1) when the
diphthong is immediately followed in the
same ne by the sound of a voiceless
consonant ;‘ and (2) when the diphthong
occurs at end of a syllable which is immedi-
ately followed in the same word by an un-
accented syllable beginning with the sound
of a voiceless consonant and containing an
obscurely pronounced vowel. Under all
other conditions standard i is employed. Ex-
amples of words pronounced in dialectic i
are: advice, ice, wife, cipher, rifle, vital;
examples of words pronounced with standard

‘Queries and Answers
on New World Court

Reservations to Protocol Are Five
in Number—“Harmony Peace
Plan” Discussed

(. What are the “Harding-Hughes-
Coolidge” reservations?

A. The reservations, five in number,
stipulate in brief:

1. That entry intothe Cotirt will not in-
volve any legal relation with the League
of Nations.

2. That the United Stated will be allow-
ed to participate in electing the judges.

3. That the United States will pay its
share ofthe expenses.

|
4. That the statute ofthe Court cannot |

be amended without our consent.

5. That the United States shall be in
no manner bound by any
opinion of the Court.

Q. Why are these reservations made?

A. The strongest objection to the
World Court is that it is a League Court,
created, fostered and controlled by the
League. Since the United States is not
a member of the League and is not de-
sirous of entering into any entangling
relation with that body, the reservations
were made to insure our independence of
the League of Nations and to give us a
reasonable control over the conduct and
destiny ofthe Court.

Q. Why is Borah opposed to the Court?

A. His main reasons are:

advisory

1, The Court is a “legal department of
the League” because of its power to ren-
der advisory opinions.

2. Lack of compulsory jurisdiction over
important disputes on the part of the
Court.

3. There is no law for the Court to ap-
ply. International law must be codified
first before a court can function.

4. No court can be effective in its op-
eration if war, is not immediately out-
lawed.
| Q. Under what conditions would Borah
favor entrance into the Court?

A. His conditions-are four:
1, International law must first be codi-
' fied.

2

2. Power to render advisory opinions
must be taken away from the Court.

3. Law must be outlawed.

4. Compulsory jurisdiction must be ex-
| tended.

Q. What is the “Harmony Peace Plan”?
What is its purpose? Who is responsible
| for it?

A, The “Harmony Peace Plan” favors

| immediate entrance into the Court under
} the “Harding-Hughes-Coolidge” reserva-
tions, the United States to withdraw
| from the Court within five years ‘if the
signatory powers do not unite in out-
lawing war, writing an international code,
|and extending the compulsory jurisdic-
_tion of the Court. Its purpose is to ef-
fect a compromise between the Borah
| forces and those in favor of the Court.
It was formtlated recently by thirty
| prominent leaders of thought in this
| country and endorsed by them.

LITERARY SOCIETIES

Metrophilian
At the regular meeting of the Metro
| Society, Thursday ,December loth, the
| debate was dispensed with on account of
| the large amount of regular business to
be taken up. It is the plan of the society
| to conduct the nevt meeting as a par-
| liamentary drill forthe benefit of the new
|men. This plan is an innovation in the
| Metro Society, and it is hoped that it
| will prove very beneficial.

Philanthropic

| The regular meeting ofthe Philanthrop-
ic Literary Society was held last Thurs-
day night with a good attendance. Pres-
| ident Barrington was in the chair.
| The first number on the program was
|a debate onthe subject, Resolved: That
|the Hale System of electing representa-
tives be adopted for all legislative bodies.
The debaters were, J. H? Meadows and
H. H. Worzel forthe affirmative, and J.
B. Moriarty and L. Wadsworth for the
negative. A decision was reached in
favor of the negative. Messrs. ‘Aber-
nathy, Morrison, and Glenn acted as de-
cision committee.

~~

i are: ‘alibi, fie, vie, ° bias, final, citation,
advise. :

The two peculiarities discussed are charac-
teristic of eastern Virginia speech and that
of a few other sectioss of the country. The
dialectic sounds are clearly due to the specific
phonetic conditions pointed out above.

G. F. Houck then gave selection en-
| titled “The Fust Banjo” which was very
well rendered. C. H. DuBose followed
with a reading, taken from an old edition
jof the Davidsonian on “Christmas in This
and Other Lands.”

The business session was then held, af-
ter which the society adjourned.

BANQUET COMMENTS
By Ernest Milton

The occasion at Gastonia Saturday night
was one which brought Gastonia and David-
son still closer together. In fact, we do not
believe that it would be amiss to say that the
alumni of Gastonia and Davidson are closer
‘together than the alumni of Charlotte, even
though the latter are at the very doors of

| Davidson.

We suggest an organization of the alumni
in some of the other towns nearby. They
can do immeasurable good, and get a great
| deal of pleasure out of it at the same time.

Many good impromptu speeches were given
Saturday night, but perhaps the one which
struck a most vibrant chord were the few re-
marks made by Tom Baker. “You may have
offers to go to other schools,” said this Wild-
cat in talking directly to the Gastonia High
School students, but we have something to
offer you at Davidson that money can't buy,
and if you should accept cne of these offers
you will, in so doing, make one of the big-
gest mistakes of your life, assuming that
| you want to come to Davidson.”

Coach Monk Younger said that we had a
better season than we had anticipated, and
|in analyzing the cause he remarked, “We
“owe it to the student body spirit and to the
fact that Captain Black and 45 real Ameri-
cans gave Tex and me everything they had.”

Mr. Johnson, of Barium Springs, gave a
rather witty discourse, and averred that font-
ball had been likened to war. To which Tom
| Baker later replied that this was not true,
|since Sherman had once given a definition
|of war that could not be applied to football.

The principal of the Gastonia High School,
lauded Davidson for its spirit (He is a Caro-
lint man) and took this occasion to thank the
institution for the teachers Davidson had
| Biven Gastonia, since four of the staff were
| graduates of Davidson.

Dr. McConnell remarked that even out in
Oregon recently that two men were discuss-
ing the merits of Davidson, and that perhaps
the reputation of the school was by now in-
ternational. We don’t want to buy players,
and we are not going to, but we do want you
to come to one of the best colleges in the
South,” were the remarks he directed to the
Gastonia, High School graduates.

One of the speeches jammed full of humor

+

was that delivered by Dr. Glenn. “When I
see such boys come from Davidson like Pat
Crawford and a few others around here, I
see that they have made good characters out
of questionable boys, and it must be a good
school.” (Dr. Glenn never attended David-
son, but he is one of its most loyal sup-
porters). |

Furthermore, it was stated that one of the
Gastonia players made the remark one day
that of the schools he had visited that he

liked Davidson better than any others pea
