This cutback may affect
the funds for grants for in-
coming freshmen next year
or ever admissions policy.
Grants to those already re-
ceiving aid from the pro-
gram should not be affected,
according to H. Edmunds
White, director of admissions
and financial aid.

Only 31,000 first year stu-
dents will get need grants
next year compared to the
144,600 who recieved similar
grants this fall, according to
-estimates by administrators
in the U. S..Office of Educa-
tion.

A. surprise reduction of $18
million in Congressional ap-
propriations caused the scal-
ing down of the program.

H. Edmunds White, direc-
tor of admissions and finan-
cial aid, said that the school
gets more than $35,000 from
the program. White said the
cutback might. eventually
force the school to seek other
sources for funds or to
change the admissions policy.

Davidson Johnson, who
heads up the education-
al opportunity branch in the
Office of Education, said the
cutback would be ‘‘deva-
stating."

He. noted that the grant
program includes the re-
newal of awards to previous
recipients, and that this lea-
ves only first-year grants —
going mostly to college fresh
‘men — with which to absorb
the budget cuts.

By including $9 million that
has been carried over from
fiscal 1968. the Office of
Education expects it will
have about $133.6 million for

Mr. Johnson said it was
‘inexcusable’ that the con-
ference .committee had not
investigated the matter more
than it did.

Had it .done so, he said,
it would have realized that
the program needed addition.

with its previous level of
operation.

The cutback in the educa.

marks a significant reversal
for the Johnson Administra-
tion's financial aid plans for
college students.

Although the nation’s grad
uate schools did not: face the
70 percent reduction in fall
enrollment some predicted
last year because of the
draft, the second semester
crunch may hurt them badly.

Most universities were
taken by surprise this fall,
when the 25-50 percent. of
their students expecting to
be drafted returned to school
after all.

Some universities, which
had accepted more graduate
students than they could han.
die in order to make up for
the draft's toll, have been
faced with money and hous-
ing shortages — and too
many students.

They had faited to caicu-
late this fall’s election and
its ramifications on the draft
in their estimates last spring.

In February, when the Se
lective Service System an
nounced that graduate stud
ents would no

interst.”’ both universities and
the government . predicted
that schools might lose up
to 70 percent of their first.
year students. They forecast
a great increase in female
and middle-aged graduate
students.

Selective Service officials
predicted that students would
make up.as much as 90 per
cent of the draft call-ups
in many states. The Defense
Department said 63 percent
of the 240,000 draftees pre-
dicted for 1969 would be stu-
dents. Students made up 3.8
percent this year.

But the crunch failed to
materialize this fall. For one
thing. draft calis beginning
in July were drastically low-
er than those for previous

Lecturers’ Style

By JOHN McLEAN
Staff Writer

Some speakers would re.
fuse to come to Davidson if
they knew they had to pub
lish their lectures, Dean of
Faculty Frontis W. Johnston
said this week.

Responding to a suggestion
jin last week's DAVIDSON.
IAN that Reynolds Lecturers
be required to publish in

order to ensure effective lec- *

tures, Johnston also said it
was hard to guarantee in ad-
vance a speaker whose Icc-
tures student swould find
stimulating.

Another Davidson lecture
series, the Otts series. offers
speakers an additional $250
for publishing,
jority of Otts lecturers have
published. .

-Scott Woodmansee, college
chaplain and director of the
Otts program, said that most
Otts lecturers are anxious to
publish, since it enhances

months. And they will stay
that way until January when
the elections are well over.

How much calls will rise
will depend on the man-
power needs of the armed
forces, the status of the
Vietnam war, and the mood
of the new: President.

But they are sure to rise

at least a little, according
to Mrs. Betty Vetter, an
official of the Scientific Man-
power Commission, a private
research agency in Washing-
ton.
* Her prediction is based on
the fact that draft calls for
the last few years have run
in 18: month cycles: the high
point of the latest cycle is
due in January 1969.

Whatever the increase, it
is sure to hit students hard
er next semester; under pre.
sent draft regulations, the
oldest eligible males are first
to go. and graduate students
newly classified !-A are per
fect targets. ;

Those who receive induc-
flon notices during the pre-
sent school term are allowed
fo stay in school to finish the
term, but must then report
for induction.

But despite the fact that
total graduate enrollment
has changed very little in
numbers. the edict has not
been without effect.

Graduate schools at sev
eral universitiés have report-
ed drops in enrollment from
one to 20 percent, Profession-
a] schools seem harder hit
than. most.

At Valparaiso University.
25 of 150 students enrolled
in the law school didn’t regis-
ter. in September. Lehigh
University reports a 13 per
cent. decrease in enrollment.

And at = many — schools,
graduate departments found
that women and older (over
26) men made up larger por
tions of their enrollees than
ever before. Some schools
claimed that their students
are of lower ability than
they would have been be-
fore the draft.

Universities, which oppos-
ed the move to end grad-
uate deferments, are react-
ing to their students’ con-
cern in many ways.

Several heavily graduate
universitics, among them
Massachusetts Institufe of
Technology, have announced
that students whose educa-
