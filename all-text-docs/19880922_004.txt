Kappa Sigs win “Best
New Chapter” award

By LISA GERRARD
Davidson’s Kappa Sigma fra-
ternity, reinstated in January after
a 15-year absence from the col-
lege, was recently named best

new chapter at a national Kappa .

‘Sigma leadership conference in
Charlottesville, Va. To attain the
award the group of 97 Davidson
men surpassed 4 other new chap-

ters in, overall campus involve- ,

ment, academic excellence, fi-
nancial stability and success in
rush.

Although a core of about 35
seniors began working in 1985 to
bring the Delta chapter of Kappa
Sigma back to Patterson Court,
most of the preparation to enter
the national organization took
place last year.

The brothers wrote and submit-,

ted to the national chapter a list of
bylaws, a history of the chapter
and a history of each brother, as
well as set up their kitchen fi-
nances.

Current president John Cock
said, “Weare real pleased to have
gotten it because we did a lot of

hard work last year. It was a good
reward.”

Among the 200 chapters that
belong to the national fraternity,
Cock says Davidson’s group
stands out because of their strong
sense of commitment and unity.
He calls the group very diverse,
open and accepting. Former treas-
urer Jim Patterson agrees. “We
are a group of individuals but also
a group with a big common inter-
est. We like to stress individual
gain as well as group gain.”

According to Cock, one major
common interest of the group is
their participation in service proj-

ects. “A good many of them are |

involved in one or more,” he said,
noting work with Habitat for
Humanity, the Metrolina Food
Bank, a clothing closet in Char-
lotte and Cystic Fibrosis dance-a-
thons.

Cock attributes the Delta chap-
ter’s early success not to the vari-
ous house activities, however, but
to the friendships within the
group. “We have a true sense of
brotherhood,” he said.

WORKERS, from page 1

claimed that it led to unconscious
mistakes and repeated labor that
can cause frustration.

The multitude of safety checks
necessary to approve the electri-
cal work were, in his opinion,
done too quickly in order to meet
the prescribed deadlines. He said
that on a job of this size, rushing
and pressure are the rule rather
than the exception, but he also felt
that this project had been started
on an unrealistic time table that

was now causing undue pressure.

Working 10 to 12 hours a day six
days a week, he has a point.

I tried to get a few words in with
the work-site superintendent. He
was understandably too busy to
say more than, “You’ve gotta
have adeadline,” before returning
to the unenviable task of trying to
cover all four corners of a work-
site at once.

I also got a chance to talk to an
experienced worker in the indus-
try who has worked at Davidson
before on Akers, Irwin, and Knox
dorms. He felt that the expecta-
tions had simply been too high.
He stated that he was really quite
amazed at the progress that had
already been made. He felt that
the general contractor, Barger
Construction, was doing an excel-
lent job, but unrealistic comple-

tion dates are common in the con-
struction business and you just
have to live with it.

When asked whether he
thought that the dorms would be
ready by the new completion
dates, he was not sure. They.

_ might, but even if they are, he

said, “I sure wouldn’t want to live
in them.” With ankle deep mud
and constant noise until Novem-
ber first or later, I wouldn’t want
to either.
’ On a very ‘serious. ‘note, this
worker specifically requested that
no Davidson students drive on the
gravel road leading to the soccer
field... It is unnecessary and dan-
gerous and it messes up the prepa-
rations for future paving. He said
that students look at him and the
other men like they are the ones in
the.way. Please, show a little
courtesy and stay off the road!
As I left the site, I spoke with an
old laborer as he shoveled gravel
around the new curbing. Hiscom-
ments summed up, I think, the
attitude of many involved with

this project when he stated, “I'll.

be glad as hell when we get out of
this place.”

The attitude of the workers at
the site of the new athletic com-
plex seemed more subdued. The
general contractors, Rogers
Builders, are making fine prog-
ress and the workers. were not
having to put in excessive over-

time.

When asked-his impression of
Davidson’s grand. new project,
one grizzled iron worker stated,
“Itain’tnothin’. It’s got some big
hunks of iron, but itain’tnothin’.”
He’s been welding up as high as
seventeen stories. It doesn’t mat-
ter to him as long as it pays the
bills.

‘Another sub-contracting
worker who was doing the plaster
for the racquet-ball courts also
seemed quite relaxed about his
work. He is one of five brothers
working for his company and he
seemed quite satisfied with his
work. Work-site morale, he
claimed, was quite high and the
work was going smoothly.

When asked about the possible
safety hazards on the job, he said
that one man had fallen and
cracked a few ribs, but he was all
right now. Another had fractured
his leg when a load of bricks fell
on him off of his hand cart. In an
industry where accidental death is
not unheard of, this is an excellent
safety record.

The difference in attitude be-
tween the two sites seems to me to
be the difference between one
project fighting deadline and
another still a year from comple-
tion, a fact we. might want to
remember come the scheduled
grand opening for the ’89 basket-
ball season.

the long distance service is pro-
vided to students at a 10% dis-
count.

The college also needed to
update the Dimension 400
switchboard that had been in use
since 1977. Expanding phone
service would also be easier.

with the office of administrative

“I haven’t talked to any one
who said it’s a great system,”’
Sparks said. Sparks believes that
fixing the system would require
two changes: “All that really
needs to get done is to get more
lines and get access to an opera-
tor. Those are the two points SGA.
will be pushing for,” Sparks said.
