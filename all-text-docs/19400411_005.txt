THE DAVIDSONIAN

: Page Five

| Question

z= i the Week

Davidson's largest single gift has
recently been made in the form of
a new library. Because this. btild-

ing will be a vital part in’ the col-
lege life of every student, it should
contain every convenience and aid
the students. Therefore, our
question is, “What new (or old)
features would you like to have in

to

our new library?”

Monroe Bush, Sophomore:

“There might be new fea-
tures that well added
the new library that is soon to be

are lacking in the present one. For
instance, I think should

of several colleges which have this
feature in its library and it seems
to work out very well.

“IT might suggest that there be a
sort of reception room at the en-
trance of the library. Here should
be paintings, and
other gifts to the college as well
as different trophies that the col-
lege has won in past years.”

placed statues,

Frank Barker, Junior:

“Since the sum that has been
donated the college is as large as
it is, it seems that several new fea-
tures could be added which would
make it on a par with the modern
libraries of today. First, I would
suggest a lounge for the students
where they could sit and read and
smoke if they desired. Second, I
would suggest a separate room with
a conglomeration of assorted books;
history, fiction, biography, poetry,
etc ... classics, if you please, which
could not be removed from the
room, but would have to be read
there. In other words, one could
neither bring nor take out any
books from this ‘library.’ Such a
feature as this last one has recently
met with great success at the Uni-
versity of Alabama, and I think
that it would meet with equal suc-
cess here.”

John Withers, Senior:

“T suggest that in the new library
there should be a large room with
no bodk shelves or books in it, but
of sitting room where one
could read in comfort. It should al-
so, in my opinion, be equipped with
collapsible for writing and
think there should
be private study rooms in the new
library where one could be able to
concentrate better and perhaps spe-
cial

a sort

rooms for typing.

“A very beneficial change would
be a better catalog or means of ac-
cess to the magazines and old news-
papers. It should arranged
that it would not take much time
for the student to find what he is
looking: for.”

be so

George Matthews, Sophomore:

“Personally I think the present
system used in the library is suf-
ficient to supply the demands of the
students. It is easy for one, accord-
ing to the present system, to find
any book he is looking for. I don’t
think it would be a bad idea to have
a special reading room. As for more
minor changes, the lighting system
should -be’ better and the chairs
should be more comfortable. Of
course there should be, and there |
probably -will be more books, both
fiction and non-fiction, but on the
whole I think the present system is
satisfactory.”

Dick Keriyon, Senior:

“nr

Chere will, in all probabilitity, be
many new features in the new lib-
rary that are needless to mention

| Archibald

in “The Question of ‘the Week” but
I will mention a few that come to}
my mind on the spur of the mo- |
ment. I think it would be better if?
there was a special room dedicated |
antiques, historical |
books, etc., of which there are many |
at Davidson, There should be nich- |

to curios,

es in the walls for, pictures, busts, |
statues, etc., so they would not be}
danger knocked |
and broken.”

in any of being

over

Boyd Flynn, Junior:

“For convenience’s sake, it would |
be helpful to have better rest-
room facilities in the library. 1)
also think more small tables for
individual study would be benefici-
al. From experience we all know that
it is usually difficult to study when |

there is a large group crowding |
around the long tables. This would
also make for quieter study, for
when someone enters or leaves the
rodm, he cannot disturb anyone
else if he is working at a table
alone. Checking out of books should}
be permitted as long as the library |

is open.”
