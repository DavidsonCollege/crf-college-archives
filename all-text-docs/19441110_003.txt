sonally, (here 1 go—out on a limb) I pick Hal Newhouser
of the Tigers over Verne Stephens of the Browns.
Rumor has it that Davidson may not field a 1944-
45 baseball team. We hate to see that because we be-
lieve that there is some swell talent on the Hill this
year. With Captain Lowry back from last year’s
squad and such summer stars as Phil Edwards, Gabby
Bryant, Al Scarborough (?), Andy Owens, and Jack
Etheridge, we should be able to put out a fair team.
Even after mid-term losses and such, with this as a
nucleus, surely Coach Shepard could form a worthy
quintet of players. I hope everyone will really give
this a.good thought and express his opinion. Maybe
we'll have a team yet.

In looking over Sunday's paper I see where Laurin-
burg at the fire out of Rockingham. It seems that 60 or
70 e runs featured the game and one-guy chased 100

kickoff 100 yards but was tackled on the opponent’s 2.

our scrap with Darlington and if it’s O. K. with every-
body I'll go down and yell for Davidson and get my head
bashed in. How about a ride, coach?
The Gremlins are MY boys. Trippi can run on my

it on the next try when he quick-kicked 84 yards.
