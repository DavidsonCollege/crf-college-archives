‘This year candidates are
lining up behind crucial is-
sues in the campaign for
President of the Student
Government ‘Association.

The candidates are Cecil
Burney, an active _ politi-
cian and Vice President of
the SGA; Danny Clodfelter,
an experienced senator who
spearheaded the move
against area exams; Joe
Delk, a pro-fraternity dark-
horse; Jody Turner, a mo-
derate fraternity man; and
Greg Sikes, a pro-fraternity
crusader.

“Burney has been on the
Senate Executive Committe
since he was a freshman.
He was active in the drive
for——voluntary ROTC, —a
member of the Committee of
Eighteen, and is presently
serving as President of the
Residence’ Hall. Council. He
is also a North Carolina Fel-
low. a

Burney feels that ‘‘one of
the big weaknesses we’ have
had is ‘that faculty mem-
bers and administrators have
frequently been irresponsive
to the students. Past stu-
dent leaders’ have been
timid, giving up too easily
on important student — is-
sues.”’

Calling for ‘‘a change in
style,’ he commented on
the senate last fall. ‘‘The
SGA didn't provide a forum
for good exchange on the
fraternity issue. It was un-
fortunate that pro-fraternity
forces couldn't even use the
student senate as a place to
go for discussion of the is-
sues involved.

~ Burney wants to reevalu.
ate the Honor Court ‘‘to eli-

minate the damage done to
people in the past while re-
taining
esty.””

Among other things he be-

the ideals of hon-

Sikes.

lieves that fed exams,
grades, and the Code of Re-
sponsibility should be abo-
lished. According to Burney:
“‘We need to move away
from the moralistic back-
woods ideas that this col-
lege runs on, and students
ought to start with a new
style and a new way of do-
ing things."’

Clodfelter is another ac-
tive senator who spent a
year on the Educational
Policy Committee. A Mc-
Connell Scholar, he is pre-
sently a member of the
Honors College.

Clodfelter thinks the
trustees’ decision on frater-
nities is here to stay, He

feels, however, that the pre-

sent program is not operat-
ing well, hurting freshmen
worst of all.

“Before we had institution-
al provisions such as rush
and pledge training to ac-
commodate the freshmen on
the court,. but in this new
system there is no means
for integrating a freshman
into the social life.”

Clodfelter hopes the SGA,
which he describes as ‘‘cum-
bersome,"’ can be replaced
by ‘‘a community-wide gov-
ernment with  representa-
tives composed of the stu-
dents, faculty, and the ad-
ministration to make deci-
sions now made largely by
the faculty.”

According to Clodfelter,.
“We have got to rethink the
function of student govern-
ment before we can have
any effect on
sues.”

‘He also favors student re-
presentation on the Admis-
sions Committee. “I think
it's poppycock that if we
want to do anything around
here, it’s all right if a ma-
jority ‘of other schools do

that

Joe,Delk has intentionally
stayed out of campus poli-
tics so far because he
“wanted. to build a political
base by involving myself in
academics and other activi-
ties.’ vel.

He is a Dana Scholar and
President of Alpha Phi Ome-
ga. In music, he has been
active in the Wind Ensem-
ble, and is the leader of the
Pep Band.

Delk’'s theme for the elec-
tion is ‘Representation and
Response."’ He thinks that

‘the SGA has slumped to a
new low because its authori-
ty and responsibility have
beén overextended. a

TURNER

Merritt-Parman, Grissett
Enter Editorial Election

By ED SHOAF
Editor-in-Chief

A coeditorship team and
and a single candidate will
be vying for editorship of
THE DAVIDSONIAN in next
Tuesday’s elections. Russ

Rob Krebs,

Hal

Vii aia

Merritt and Don Parman
have filed to run as coedi-
tors and will be opposed by
David Grissett.

Merritt and Parman bring
six years of combined ex-
perience on the paper to the
race. Merritt, who worked
two years professionally for
the Roanoke World-News,
has served THE DAVID-
SONIAN as Sports Editor
and Associate Editor.

As a freshman he receiv
ed the D. Grier Martin
Award as the best reporter.
Parman has also served as
Sports Editor and during the
past year as Managing Edi-
tor.

Grissett has served as
Managing Editor over the
past year and previous to
that held an assistant man-
aging- editorship.

In .an interview, Merritt
and Parman expressed fu-
ture plans for the paper as

constituting their main rea-

son for running.

“We have a definite idea
of the kind of newspaper we
would like to see on this
campus’ next year,” they
said. “THE DAVIDSONIAN
has to become more
pretive while maintaining
journalistic objectivity. There

inter- .

is no reason to compete with
the announcement sheet or
WDAV for publicizing cam-
pus happenings.

“We ‘would like to direct
the paper more to the stu-
dents here on campus than
to our off campus subscrib
ers,” the candidates said.

Grissett, orfthe other hand,
said he was running mainly
on the basis of one issue, edi-
torial policy. ‘‘I would like to
effect a change in editorial
policy,’ he said, ‘an im-
mediate example being the
viewpoint toward the recent
changes in the social sy-
stem

Grissett went on to say
“If the purpose of the ¢ol-
lege. was as they said, to
put into effect a social sy-
stem for all Davidson stu-
dents, they overlooked a
significant percentage of
those students that still favor
a mutually selective social
system of fraternities.”

Editorially, Merritt and
Parman said “Our emphasis
willbe on improvement of
the Davidson educational
environment, and we will an-
alyze the concrete issues in-
