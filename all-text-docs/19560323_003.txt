LEON HOWELL

Until you reach the top, or participate in scattered “big- will then move on to play |

time” matches, golf is a lonesome game. To be good, you have
to depend on a combination of calculated skill and strong
faith in yourself. There are no spectators to give you a boost
with their cheers or teammates to aid you in recovering a

brilliant daring in the 1954 Masters endeared him to fans the
world over.

George Scott. who played several leisurely holes with
him before the regular match, remarked that Patton was in
the rough every time but one, yet he birdied one and had
