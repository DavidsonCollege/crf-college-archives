Spencer Discusses Junior
Year Abroad, Coeducation

By TOM BRUCE
Staff Writer

At a Tuesday Open End,
President Samuel R. Spencer
fielded questions from a_ recep-
tive student audience on coed-
ucation, foreign study programs,
aod the hiring of a Clinical Psy-
chologist.

Spencer reassured — students
that some decision, “either yea
or nay,” would come from the
Trustees at their May meeting
on the coeducation issue.

Spencer emphasized the work
of the Educational Policy Com-
mittee to certify faculty, stu
dent, and alumni support and
to come up with some viable
proposal to make the change-
over.

Spencer stated that he had re
jected the idea of implementing
coeducation through purely ad-
ministrative means that would
not consult student and faculty
Viewpoints. He cited the com-
mittee of Associate Professor of
History W. Brown Patterson as
dving a service that would en-
list the ideas of many persons
instead of just a few.

Spencer said that he would
review the committee's findings
and act on them before they
are submitted to the trustees.

Spencer said that students
should not nurse false hopes
that coeducation ‘‘will be a pan-
acea to solve every problem and
cure every complaint.” On the
subject of declining admissions,
Spencer said, “One of the rea-
sons I am in favor of coeduca-
tion is the growing evidence
that prospective students are re-
pelled by the thought of an all-
male school."’

“Declinng admissions may
indicate a need to implement
coeducation,"’ he added.

When a student raised a ques-
tion concerning low campus mo-
rale as evidenced by the recent
hall counselor’s petition, Spen-
cer answered, ‘During every
year, particularly at this time,
there is a morale slump. I know
this from personal experience
because I seriously considered
transferring during my _ fresh-
man year at Davidson.”

Answering a questicn on dis-
satisfaction evidenced by some
students returning from Junior
Year Abroad in’ France or
Greece, Spencer stated that he
had asked the Foreign Study
Committee to provide for a pro-
gram where students’ could
spend two years studying in a
foreign country. He added that
he was very concerned to learn

India Coming To Davidson
As Ten Speak, Sleep Hindi

Ten American college — stu-
dents will be speaking, eating,
sleeping and working with the
Hindi lenguage during a unique,
intensive cight-week . language
institute near Davidson College
this summer, supported by a
$10,215 grant from the U. S. Of-
fice of Education.

The grant was secured by
Davidson acting as agent for the
Southern Atlantic States Asso-
ciation for Souih Asian Studies
SASASAS). an organization of
15 colleges and universities de-
veloping South Asiam studies
programs.

Frederick H. Gaige, director
of Davidson’s South Asian stud-
ies program and chairman of
the SASASAS, described the
summer institute:

“This will be the first time in
this country that there has been
such a total-immersion type of
program in the Hindi language.
We plan to rent a large house
or farm near Davidson, and all
participants will be totally in-
volved with Hindi and the study
of India, where Hindi is spoken.

“In addition to learning the
language using textbooks and
tape recorders, students will
eat and even prepare Indian
food, hear recorded radio broad-
casts from India, play Indian
musical instruments and Indian
sports, and speak the Hindi lan-
guage as much as possible. Next
to living in India, this will be
the best possible environment
in which to learn this- language.”

The program’s linguist-direc-
tor will be John T. Roberts,
assistant professor of Hindi and
Linguistics at the University of
Virginia. His wife will serve as

part-time secretary and_ book-
keeper.

The language instructor will
be Harbans Lal Narang, assis-
tant professor of education at
the University of Saskatchewan,
Canada. His wife, also a native
of India, will be in charge of
preparing meals and organizing
the household.

The program will provide Na-
tional Defense Foreign  Lan-
guage (NDFL) Fellowships, cov-
ering all basic expenses, for
five undergraduate students and
five graduate students. Enroll-
ment will not be limited to the
SASASAS institutions, although
recruitment efforts will be most-
ly directed at those schools.

The program will be taught on
two levels: introductory (Hin-
di 1-2) for undergraduates, and
advanced (Hindi 3-4) for gradu-
ate students.

Gaige noted that the U. S. Of-
fice of Education is awarding

that four of last year’s returnees
had left Davidson.

When a student asked of his
feelings on the role of the Clin
ical Psychologist at Davidson,
Spencer directed the question to
Vice-President for Academic Af
fairs John Bevan.

Bevan said, ‘I am somewhat
concerned about the possibility
of a counseling overload. I am
generalizing about the number
of persons who will require the
help of a clinical psychologist,
but I would estimate it to be 25
at any given time. There might
be as many as 100 others who
need only a sympathetic listen-
er, a service that hight better
be rendered by faculty mem-
bers, the Dean of Students, or
the Chaplain. Maybe we should
consider hiring a Chaplain with
training in this area. I am very
ccuscious of a counseling over-
load.”

Hall Counselors To Be Chosen

By DAVID ARANT
Staff Writer

On Jan. 19, applications will
be available to rising juniors to
fill the hall counsler positions
for next year’s freshman class.
The deadline for applications
will be Jan. 29.

Dean of studens Will H. Terry
egain faces the task of hiring
25 students who will make ac
ceptable hall counselors. If the
number of applicants is close to
past response, Terry predicts
that about fifty to sixty students
will be interested in the position.

After the deadline date, the
selection of the counselors from
the applications begins. “‘A se-
lection committee of Mrs. Scotty
Nicholls, William B. Hight, a
group of present hall counselors,
president of the RHC, president
of the student body, and myself
will evaluate the applications,”
Terry said.

Terry noted the importance
of the application itself in de

ciding the final selection. Along:

with this. each applicant will
undergo a= personal interview.
Each applicant is encouraged to
take a personality inventory ad
ministered by Dr. Hight.

The type of person the selec
tion committee wants for a
hall counselor is “one who
really wants to do the job, who
has concern for people, who is
willing to spend the hours neces
sary in his job. and whose at
titude toward Davidson is con
structive,” according to Terry.

After the applicants have been
reviewed in this manner, the
final selection will be announc-
ed in the middle of February.
After the selection the hall coun-
selors will have a_ sensitivity
session in preparation for their
job.

Also Terry hopes to increase
the hall counselors’ knowledge
needed in guiding the freshmen.

In summing up the role of
the hall counselor, Terry said,
“The hall counselor probably
makes the most important con-
tribution of any individual: on

campus. He is invaluable to the
life of the college and the in
dividual freshman.”

Many of the present hall
counselors echoed Terry's be-
lief. ‘‘You would be surprised at
how many problems entering
freshmen face,”’ said one hall
counselor. “‘I've found that I
have to deal with many person-
al and intimate problems as
well as the academic problems.”’

Another counselor this year
said he was amazed at the
amount of time counseling
takes.
