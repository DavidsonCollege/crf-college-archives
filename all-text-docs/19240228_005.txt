THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 28, 2924

Open Forum

(Continued from page 4)
sociology, social )psychology, the world's
needs and their remedies, and the temper of
the times; men who can give Christianity its
fullest, broadest appeal as a religion of love,
and not of criticisms and dissensions. It's
time to get out of the rut.

(4) And there is the majority—thoughtless
and irresponsible, who prate wisely and at
length about things they know nothing about;
the majority that is wasting its money and
its time and kicking about long French as-
signments and at having to go to church (of
which they are members). These men are
not narrow. They simply don't care. They
never have their own opinions, because they
don't think. Unless they change they will
be the asses to bear the burdens of life in
some little one-horse job. Are you in this
group? No, of course, it’s the other fellow.

It is time for the Davidson student body
to see where it stands. What have you got
that the world will want? How many years
are you going to waste before you begin to
work, Get some system into your life. Do
the things that will help you. Don't follow
the crowd, That is the avocation of empty
pates and fools. Do you think you will be
able to settle down when you get out of the
“terrible rut” of college life? The world
is rushing, too, faster than you ever move
here. Why not start working NOW ?

Your success in life is not going to depend
on a little diploma, but on your ability—and
ability means power to hold down a job—
not a seat in a bull session. You must learn
how to work—and very few of you know |
how now. The world wants men who know
their subjects from the ground up. If you
can get it in bull sessions and idleness—well
and good. All association is educative, but
a lot of education is worthless. What are
you getting that is of practical value to you?

Some one has remarked lately, “If we
could only see ourselves as others see us.”
The magazinees are full of how others see.
us, and they show little respect for the col-,
lege man, One prominent alumnus, speak- |
ing directly of Davidson, says, “Both the
student body and faculty are unpardonably |
lazy and they kid themselves on calling it
conservative.” And then to quote Mr. Todd
again:

“Although a college man myself, I find I
am continually wondering whether the col-
lege of today is doing what it should to en-
able the young man to meet the fierce com-
petition of modern business life. Any rea-
sonably bright boy can complete the academic
course of practically any college in the coun-
try if he will study two hours a day for five
days a week and loaf all summer. That is
what I call it, rest cure.”

And I'd like to say ditto to Mr. Todd.

Captain Morrison Has
Long Record of Service

Conductor on Charlotte-Salisbury
Line Has Made Host of Friends

Captain Morrison who runs on the
train from Charlotte to Salisbury, via
Barber's Junction which passes through
Davidson twice a day, has been in the
employ of the railroad company for 44
years. He has been running on this
division, known as the Atlantic, Ten-

essee and Ohio, during all of\this time. |

in this section. It is no small accom-|
plishment to follow a vocation as exact-
ing as his and maintain the record that
he has. The reason for his great pop-
ularity and his large number of friends
is the kindly way he treats his pas-
sengers, especially the women and chil-
dren.

Picture Management
Announces Bookings

Students Will See Best of
Film Stories This Spring

Clarence Budington Kelland’s famous
story, Brothers Under the Skin, has been
made into a film masterpiece of Goldwyn
Pictures, and the Davidson student body
will be given the opportunity of seeing this
movie next Saturday night. The picture
follows closely the narrative as Written by
Mr. Kelland, whose ability as an author of
entertaining short stories is well known. It
promises to be in the class of the best pic-
tures shown at Davidson this year.

One of the really big pictures of the year
is The Eternal City, adapted from the story
of that name by Sir Hall Caine. From all
reports of this picture it seems that it fur-
nishes entertainment par excellence, and
that’s what everyone likes in moving pictures
these days. It is a First National produe-
tion directed by George Fitzmaurice, and
numbering among the cast of stars, Barbara
La Marr, Bert Lytell, and Lionel Barrymore.
It would be hard to find the sort of theatre-
goer who would class it as anything bua
clean pistorial entertainment, presented with
scenes of wondrous beauty, and with a wealth
of detail which gives constant evideence of
careful and conscientious study of scenes and
customs of the country in which the locale
of the story is laid.

The picture was filmed in Rome, and the

director has overlooked no opportunity to

inject into it interesting episodes of the re-
cent history-making events which have tran-
spired in Italy. Mussolini and his Fascisti,
and even the Italian king are called upon to
do their parts in adding interest to the pic-
ture, It will be shown here at an early date

in March, oy

Buster Keaton is coming soon with his
second feature length comedy, Our Hospi-
tality, and if you don't believe it throws his
Three elges into the shade, you'll just have
to come it. The story concerns the
troubles of the last of the McKays when he
returns to his old home in Kentucky and
makes the technical mistake of falling in
love with the beautiful daughter of the house
of Canfield, which family has wiped out the
McKays in their long-standing feud. The
many serious complications he gets into and }

see

,the uproariously funny way he gets out of ;

Until recently Captain Morrison was |
in charge of one of the trains operating |

between Charlotte and Taylorsville. But
on account of his health he now makes
the shorter run from Charlotte to Salis-
bury. Captain Morrison has been with
the railroad since 1880, and inethe 44
years that he has been going back and
forth through this section he has made
hundreds of friends. Many of the people
living along this line he has known since
they were children. He is not so young
in body as he used to be but his genial
and likable spirit remains unchanged.
He always has a nod and a smile for the
people who ride to and from their homes
on train. Almost any time you are on
his train’ you will see Captain Morrison
going through the train picking up the
newspapers that have been left in the
seats. He gathers up these papers and
throws them off at his friends’ houses
as he passes.

The older students at Davidson have
all come to know Captain Morrison and
they remember the time when he used to
run on the 9:18. When he came through
the car collecting the tickets for Jay-
birdsville, as he called Davidson, he‘
would always have a good joke for the}

students. |

Captain Morrison was born in States-| visions do-‘not amount: to. something here
ville, in 1863 and has lived all of his life | and now, they are all invalid. If they do

them will make your jawbones ache with
laughter. Keaton is supported by his wife,
Natalie Talmadge Keaton, in this picture,
while Buster Keaton, II, one year old, also |
appears in the cast. Coming March 8. |

Other coming attractions include :

The Social Code and In Search of a Thrill,
with Viola Dana.

DR. RICHARDS SPEAKS

never boned before. If there is not an
increase in study, the vision is a failure.”

Speaking for results of the visions of;
the meeting, he demanded a greater reg-!
ularity in the lives of the student body. |
He challenged those who had seen the!
need to rid the campus of certain ir-|
regularities and the need of certain good |
features to begin work to bring about,
those changes for the good of the school.|
He added a challenge to keep the eyes to!
the present and not to look further, since
each vision is an order to immediate
service.

In closing, Dr. Richards said, “If the!

not help us now, they will not, help us
in the future.

“Visions fade. Even Paul, the apostle,
could not carry his vision but he could
carry the memory of it. We can all do
that and in doing it, we can sit down
before our vision to look over and enjoy
it. Go to it in your life on Davidson
campus, knowing that in you just now,

‘the Spirit of God makes you the best

student on the campus.”

WILDCAT QUINT LOSES

(Continued from page 1)
whole gang was running wild now and
was beginning to  score*heavily until
stopped by numerous fouls which gave
the State team a lead. MeGowan and
Johnston, for State caged three goals
each from the floor while Dickens and
Beatty also helped the cause along, by
fouls and field goals. During the second
half, Spec madé most of his markers for
the Wildeats, with Laird also assisting
his running mate. Two field goals end-

ed the game with the score — tied
exactly at 32 and 32.
By mutual consent, the game was

lengthened out tive minutes. Davidson
secured a goal, counting one tally but
State came back and ran up a field goal,
then another, a foul, and another field
goal before the Presbyterians could stop
them. The game ended with the score
30-33 in favor of the Statesmen.

Guilford Game

J. G. Frazier, acclaimed by many to be
the best basketball player in the state
proved to be the Jonah to Davidson's
hope in the tussle with Guilford, in the
last game of the week's trip. Frazier
rang up a total of 26 points for his team,
consisting of ten field goals, and
foul goals; his markers being more than
the entire Davidson score. He was the
outstanding star of the game with Cum-
mings as guard playing good ball with
three long field goals and a tight game
at guard.

Laird lead the field for Davidson, scor-|

ing four field and one free goal. Tom

DAVIDSONIAN OCCUPIES NEW
WORKING QUARTERS

About two weeks ago the Davidsonian
moved into their new quarters in the
rear of the building occupied by the fire
apparatus. A long-felt need has been
filled and the Davidsonian has its own
office.

Formerly the work of the staff, espe-
cially that of the circulation department,
jhad to be done anywhere the laborers
could find a place, and the result was
| quite a little inconvenience. Up until the
time that they moved into their office,
| the work was done in one of the labora-
tory rooms in the basement of the Phy-
sics building.
| The room is nicely fitted for its pur-
pose. It steam-heated, electrically
| lighted, and has several large windows.
The walls are beaver-boarded. <A  suffi-
cient nuinber of tables and shelves have
been provided for the use of the circula-
tion department.

Although the room is comparatively
small it is large enough for its purpose
sind much better work can be done. The
Davidsonian now has its own office and
is keeping up with other college papers
in this respect.
