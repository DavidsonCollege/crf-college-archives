NC to host presidential debate; Bush moves up in polls

By ED POWELL
Politics -

North Carolina has been chosen as one of
the two states to host the presidential de-
bates this fall.

The first of the two debates ‘will be at
Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem
on September 25. The second debate will
be held on either October 13 or 14 in Los
Angeles, California. The two debates,
sponsored by the Commission on Presiden-
tial debates, will last 90 minutes and be
conducted by a moderator and three ques-
tioners.

Since the G.O.P convention, George
Bush has made a steady come back in the
polls, but ran into serious problems this
past week. First, volunteer Jerome Brantur
was released from the campaign for his role
as a character witness in the trial of con-
victed Nazi death-camp guard John
Demjanzich. On Sunday, Fred Malek, the
deputy chairman of the Republican Na-
tional Committee, resigned amid contro-
versy that he compiled figures in 1971 on
the number of Jews in high positions in the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In 1971 Malek, who was President

Nixon’s personnel chief, apparently re- ’

ported to White. House Chief of Staff

H.R.(Bob) Haldeman that 13 of the top 35
officials in the Bureau of Labor Statistics
were Jewish. This was revealed in a July
27 memo marked “Confidential” from
Malek to Haldeman. Soon after thismemo,
two top Jewish officials in the Bureau were
moved to less visible positions within the
Bureau. The memo was discovered in the
records of President Nixon which were
recently made available to the public.

On Monday, George Bush’s campaign -

received some unexpected support from
former National Security adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski. Brzezinski, who served under
the Democratic Carter administration,
declared Democrat nominée Dukakis’ de-
fense policies too weak and outside the
Democratic mainstream.

With three of the Supreme Court Justices
in their 80’s, it is possible that the next
President could radically change the make
up of the Court. Justices Marshall, Black-
man, and Brennan are all over 80, and it is
expected that they will retire within the
next three years. A G.O.P. victory in
November would lead to a decidedly con-
servative court as these three judges,
clearly the most liberal judges of the Court,
would be replaced by conservatives. A
Dukakis victory would have little or no

impact as he would only replace liberal
judges with other ones.

Agriculture/Weather

Unexpected snow and dying winds have
given weary fire fighters relief at Yellow-
stone National Park in Wyoming. While
this is a welcomed break, officials still
warn that the fires are not out, and could
once again resume their rapid spread
through the park.

Hurricane Florence pushed into The Gulf
Coast of Mississippi last week but caused

little damage to any property. The story
may be different this week as Florida and
the southeastern coast prepare for hurri-

‘cane Gilbert which has been gathering

force in the Caribbean and may be headed
for the Atlantic coastline.

The space shuttle Discovery is-targeted
to launch later this month, but further
complications may delay the launch until
October. It has been over two years since
the ill-fated Challenger flight.
