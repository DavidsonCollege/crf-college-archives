“Poetry drew me into this world
of language—a world both palpable
and perplexing... I chose English
not because it was easy, but because
it was endlessly fascinating for me,”
she explains.

After graduating from
Middlebury, Churchill worked for
National Public Radio in Washing-
ton, DC for two years. She received
her graduate degree from Princeton
and studied for a year at Stanford.

Jonathan Sipling, Sophomore Class Senator, moved to allocate
three hundred dollars to fund the upcoming inauguration. The cost
will cover the public and private expenses for switching to the new
executives. Some type of school wide ceremony should celebrate
the event.

Dr. Suzanne Churchill, among
the newest members of the English
department, has high hopes for the
English 101, British literature, and
Modernist poetry classes she is
teaching this semester.

“T hope [my students] will gain
alove of literature, portable skills in
critical reading, and the ability to
articulate their thoughts clearly in
writing,” she says.

“Why should anyone believe

anything at all?” On Friday, Dr. ,

James Sire challenged students to
consider this question in his lecture
in the Morrison Room. About 100
Davidson students postponed their
Midwinter’s and Star Wars plans to
attended. niente sities

Dr. Sire’s lecture, sponsored
by Inter Varsity Christian Fellow-
ship (IVCF), was a look at our
culture’s notion of belief. He asked
students to name the things that
shape what they believe, and he
questioned the validity of each of
these things.

the things we believe must have
coherence, consistency and com-
pleteness in order to be valid. On
Saturday afternoon, Dr. Sire lec-
tured about “Religious Relativism
and Absolute Truth.”

Relativism is the modern idea

that there is no absolute truth, and it .
. is therefore plausible to believe al-
most anything. Dr. Sire describes it

as an “I’m okay, you’ re okay, we’re
all okay” attitude. He dispelled
common relativistic myths and es-
tablished reasons that absolute truth
could exist, specifically from a
Christian perspective.

During the question-answer
session which followed each lec-

appropriateness of talking about
Christianity if others don’t see it as
absolute truth. !

“Tf [one thinks] Christianity is
true, it ought to be proclaimed. Itis
a life leading the privileged to help
those who are less privileged,” Sire
says.

According to Sophomore Brent
Gilbert, IVCF executive board
member, the organization decided
to bring Dr. Sire to campus “in
order to present Christianity as an
intellectually viable option in the
flood of ideas here at Davidson.”

Dr. Sire is a former English
professor, author, and senior editor
of Inter Varsity Press.

The RLO staff was insistent
that “it was not the students’. fault.
It was more of a town and college
matter.”

Junior resident Sean Keesee

says; “I wish the town would have

sympathized with us more. It will
be difficult to decide which one of
us has to move and then getting
settled into anew accommodation.”

The four students have the op-
tion of choosing another house near
the far end of Baker Sports Com-
plex or moving onto freshman halls.

It is still yet to be determined

who will leave or to where.

Editor’s Note: Because RLO in-
formed the students of the decision
of the Town Council at such a late
date, many people were unable to
be contacted for this article, most
notably RLO Director Kurt Holmes,
who was out of town.

A deeper investigation of the story
will appear in next week’s
Davidsonian.
