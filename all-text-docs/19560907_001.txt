ROTC Unit Opens 37th

Year of Training Leaders

Thirty-seven years old this
month, the Davidson College Re-
serve Officers’ Training Corps
again sets its sights for the ac-
complishment of its goal—that of
training men for positions of
leadership in our army of today.

Today, the ROTC Department is
exceptionally well qualified to
carry out. its mission. It has a
staff. of five officers and six non-
commissioned officers, command.
ed by Lt. Col. John D. Sapp, the
professor of military seience and
tactics. Each of the officers has
a broad and varied background in
the military service, and all are
well qualified to present the mili-
tary subjects taught in the military
sciénce program.

In addition, each of the non.
commissioned officers are skilled
in their own particular field of
military service, and typical of
these is Sergeant Jerry Crump,
the detachment armorer, who won
the Congressional Medal of Honor
while fighting in Korea.

FACILITIES EXCELLENT

The program of instruction is
greatly aided by the physical
plant itself, which is located on
the bottom floor of W. H. Belk
Hall. Here are provided ali the
modern day instructional aids
which make each class period both
interesting and highly informative
for each cadet.

In addition to the excellent
classroom facilities, there is a
well equipped supply room, 4
large armory for weapons storage
and cleaning, an excellent small
bore indoor rifle range, and an
operations and training aids
center, where all instructional aids
are made and repaired.

ADVANTAGES LISTED

Many advantages are offered to
the student under the present day
ROTC program. For those students
who take only the two-year basic
course and later serve in the mili-
tary, the program serves as an
orientation or foundation for this
service.

In addition, the program helps
to prepare the student for ad-
vance in his selected civilian oc-
cupation by giving him the op-
portunity to observe the advant-
ages of orderliness, allowing him
to develop his supervisory ability
through practical application, im-
parting in him a sense of respon-
sibility, developing: his ability to
organize and supervise activities,
and by developing in him an un-
derstanding of people.

For those students who desire
“to complete the four year ROTC
program, and are qualified, the ad-

vantages mentioned still apply,
plus’ many’ others. Some of the
more important of these advant-
ages are:

(1) A military deferment, grant-
ed during the second semester of
the freshman year, which — will
enable the student to complete his
four-year college education prior
to being called to military service.
A contract indicating the student’s
intent to complete ROTC training
and accept a commission in the
Army Reserve, if tendered and
complete an active duty require-
ment must be completed prior to
granting a deferment.

(2) A commission as a second
lieutenant in the United States
Army Reserve is offered to stu-
dents who successfully complete
the four year program and meet
the requirements for commission.

(3) One of the few opportunities
to obtain a Regular Army commis-
sion, other than by attending one
of the service academies, is through
the advanced program. Students
designated as distinguished miti-
tary students are eligible for con-
sideration as a secord lieutenant
in the Regular Army of the United
States.

(4) During the last two years
of the four year program, the stu-
dent is paid at the rate of $0.90
per day, During the six weeks
summer camp period, between the
junior and senior year, the stu-
dent is paid approximately $78.00
per month plus travel. pay to and
from his home, to camp.

is the officer cadre of the Davidson Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps. Shown in the ROTC headquarters in Belk Hall are, (left to
right): Is¢ Lt. Edwin Van Keuren, Jr., Capt. John W. Thompson,
Lt. Col. John DO. Sapp, PMS&T, Maj. Lee R. Brown, and Capt. Arthur

of the First Presbyterian Church

tive of Spartanburg, S. C.. and a

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C.

/ ——~~—_—s Campus Welcomes 240

Freshmen to Davidson

Under the leadership of Dr. Samuel Spencer, Dean of
Students, and Carl Cooper, Freshman Advisor, the Orientation
Program for all new students began this morning in Chan.
bers Auditorium ang will continue through Tuesday evening.

Assisting in the program are a
group of twenty leaders from the
senior and junior classes, who are
serving as Orientation Advisors.
This group arrived on campus
Wednesday night for a meeting
with Spencer and Cooper to dis-
cuss the mechanics of handling the
240 men involved in the program.
Each Advisor was assigned ap.
proximately thirteen new students
for his special- consideration and
attention during the days ahead.

Yesterday the Advisors were on
hand to greet new students, pa-
tents. other relatives, and friends
as they arrived on campus and
aided in the orderly administra-
tion of registratién and room as-
signments.

COOPER SPEAKS
‘Cooper begun this morning's
‘program with a devotional talk in
which he extolled dedication,
readiness, and friendship as three
indispensible ingredients of the
successlul college career. Spencer
followed - with an explanation of
the purpose of Orientation... He
‘pointed out that the program Fri-
day and. Saturday would primarily
be concerned with testing and
course registration while Monday
and Tuesday would be devoted to
an introduction to the college
personnel and government.
Following the program, A.C.E.
Psychological Tests were giyen in
order that cach man might dis-
cover his own personality weak-
nesses and fortes. After refresh-
ments in the College Union, Pro-
fessor McGavock gave a mathe-
matics test, the purpose of which
was to diclose individual deficien-

cies and aptitudes.

The afternoon and evening were
spent in taking physical examina-
tions, physical proficiency tests,
tours of the college library, and
conferences with Faculty Advisors.

‘omorrow the new students will
try their skill at reading tests.
The purpose is to ferret out in-
efficient readers for remedial
reading attention and English
tests. which will uncover pro-
ficiency and weakness in order
that English professors may direct
appropriate emphases.

On Sunday, the Rev. George
Staples, Minister to Students, will
teach the College Bible Class with
a message directed toward Fresh-
men. Freshmen will be encouraged
to attend also the regular morning
worship and evening vesper ser-
vices. Following the vespers ser-
vice, new students will visit in
the homes of their Faculty Ad-
visors in order to begin to culti-
vate the warm faculty-student re-
lationship for which Davidson is
famous.

NEXT WEEK

On Monday and Tuesday infor-
mation will be given to the new
students on the government of the
college, the purpose of a college
education, the functions of stu-
dent government, the Y.M.C.A.
and its place in Davidson life, the
R.O.T.C. program, fraternities,
music, and health. Of particular
interest are the small discussion
groups in which new students will
be able to articulate questions on
these subjects. The program closes
Tuesday evening with a pep meet-
ing and movie.

Frosh Vocation Choices
Follow Usual Pattern

_ (O. C. News Bureau
Medieine, the ministry and engineering are the career
choices of more than half of Davidson's 240 entering fresh-

men.

The “Class of ‘60" begins a five
day orientation program Friday
morning. and most of them have
already made up their minds what
courses: they wish to take. Only
30 are in the “don't know” cate-
vory as they begin a series of
tests and interviews with facul-
ty and student advisers.

As Georgia ls Demolished

As 240 freshmen trooped on to the campus yesterday, they
saw the results of the summer’s $150,000 facelifting pro-
gram, as. well as a recently completed dormitory, as yet un-

Most noticeable among the cam-|through removal of a coating of
pus changes since May is the re- dusty red paint. Old timbers are
a dormitory, which being replaced, and the structures

are also being waterproofed.

Sixty-five have indicated that
they plan to take a pre-medical
or pre-dental course, and 35 that
they hope to become ministers.
This is not a new trend, for almost
one-fifth of Davidson's alumni are
physicians or dentists, and many
are ministers.

The influx of budding engineers
is significant, however. The col-
lege in the past several years has

Gets New Look entered into an agreement with
the Columbia University School of

Engineering and with Georgia
Tech.

The plan provides that the stu-
dent complete three years of work
at Davidson, and two at one of the
other institutions. whereupon he
is awarded bachelor’s degrees by
both Davidson and the engineer-
ing school. Twenty-seven of the
entering freshmen plan to study
