Davidson and the Arts: Taking a Sentimental View

Cease and desist. All ye whose
pretension exceeds their intellec-
tual quotient, say no to flacid, un-
informed, half-baked opinions.
We’ve hadenough. We've even
had enough of our own. We quit.
Psyche!!!! No getting rid of us that
easily. You'll have to graduate us
first.

Oh, yeah, We need a column
topic. But, of course, thinking up
award-winning ideas is,no easy

feat. And our column has to be at -

least as interesting as the unnamed
polemicist across the page (whoa,
hard task indéed).

With stream ofconsciousness,

well just put in whatever 'the hell .

we think up. OK? Good.

Now, about this senior gift
thing. Has anyone out there seen a
good piece of sculpture selected.
by the committee? We rest our
case. That hideous monstrosity
out there in front of the NC State
Science building (in Raleigh, stu-
pid) is just about the ugliest thing
the Birks have ever seen. And that
cost something like 300,000 dol-
lars. What do y'all think we’ll get

Lay Off,
Faculty

On Feb. 20, F993 a story en=*.
titled “Professors denounce switch
at Davidson.” appeared on the front
page of The Charlotte Observer's
sports section. Thisarticle reported
_ on a two-page resolution written
by Davidson professors David
Martin and Mary Anne Moore, The
resolution charged Davidson ath-
letic director Terry Holland with
sexism for changing the women’s
basketball game against Radford.
Holland made the move in order to
rentthe Belk Arena for the UNCC-
Furman men’s basketball game.
UNCC paid Davidson $4,500 for
the use of the arena. Liz Clarke of
The Charlotte Observer wrote,
“The professors wanta public apol-
ogy to the Davidson and Radford
teams, and the $4,500 to be spent
' ‘as a miserable bit of compensa-
tion,” on academics.” This resolu-
tion is scheduled to be voted on at
the March faculty meeting

for a piddling $50,000 or so? Not
much, probably. Just some half-
formed bronze phallus with an out-
Tageous price-tag. Does anybody
wantthat? Ofcourse not. Why not
divert this pile 0’ cash to another,
more worth-while venture, and ask
the arts department to cook some-
thingup for outdoor sculpture pur-
poses. Anice representational fig-
ure—two arms, a head; ample
breasts—something nice.
Speaking of the “artistic com-
munity” (formerly known as the
cultural elite), how ‘bout that
Tower of Babel we’re raising for
‘em. You'd think that’d be enough.
We could have used that money
for a particle accelerator for the
physics department or a couple of
monkeys for the biology depart-
mentormaybe we could haveeven
gone out and hired a Talmudic
scholar away from Hebrew Uni-
versity inJerusalem (aJesuit would
be good too), All of this for a
coupl¢ more freshmen a year who
wear black, listen to Bauhaus, and
“create” a lot of crap that repre-
sents the inner torment they feel

because of Jesse Helms and the
BMW their parents bought them
for graduation. Who needs it?

As far as we’re concerned,
Cunningham was damngood. And
proportional to the number of stu-
dents the arts department gradu-
ates every year, we ought to be
building them a broomcloset. Ah
hahahaha. Justkidding, folks. Of
coursé your inner tormentand aes-
thetic convictions are asimportant
to us as they are to the rest of this
campus’ liberal coterie.

- That’s right. You didn’t hear.
The Birks are liberals now. Oh,
yeah . . . our parents voted for
McGovern. Why shouldn’t we
join the great unwashed? Actu-
ally, we’ ve only beeninducted into
the academy as “honorary liber-
als.” When last week’sdiminuitive
column elicted a storm. of con-
gratulations (actually twoor three)
from the campus’ leftist contin-
gent, we were shocked and amazed.
What, you really like us? Next
thing you know, Jane Fonda will
want to date us (yeah, she didn’t
sell out). Anyway, as today’s col-

The purpose of this article is
not to defend Holland’s actions,
although feel that his record con-
cerning women’s athletics is ex-
traordinary. and that the charge of
sexism is unfounded. No, the rea-
son |*m writing this article is to
discuss a much more serious mat-
ter. Iwant to talk about a troubling
trend I’ve noted in faculty. Lately,
the faculty seems to think that they

_ run this place. They have passed

resolutions on issues that do not
haveanything to do with academic
life. One such case is the women’ s
basketball controversy. As I heard
it, the resolution written by Martin
aril Moore was on the VAX sys-
tem, popular with the faculty, Ap-

Davidson is for Teachers

widely acclaimed because of their
teaching ability, not because of
their publishing. Any professors
who want to publish do so in their
spare time, and do it well because
they like it, not because Davidson
" forces them to. This is what at-
tracts the best students, not nation-
ally “prominent”. professors who
are well-known because of their
green stamps. Davidson’scurricu-
lum is good.for a school this size,
though sometimes it has its short-
“comings. Any reductions in the
number of courses offered would
be counter-productive.

] will scream loud and long if
Davidson goes through with this
plan. I will personally kick the
shins and bite the kneecaps of the
brainless piece of rectal debris who
thought thisup. And though they
may be silent, you can bet that
many students past and present
will agree with me. If any profes-
sors are reading who support the
new idea, kiss my patoot. We pay
your salary for you to teach us, not
toincrease your personal grandeur.
Do the research in your spare time

‘instead of taking time away from
us. Are amy TRUSTEES listen-
ing? Weneed you. —

parently, someone on the faculty
read this resolution, and faxed a
copy to The Charlotte Observer.
This action broke college policy.

The faculty handbook isquiteclear, -

“Matters of official college policy
or issues of college-wide import

are to be handled by or coordinated «

through the Office of College Re-
lations.” This press release didn't
go through College Relations.
Someone on the faculty does not
feel that this rule applies to him.
Over the past year or so, the

faculty has told students how to

organize their social lives, Dean
Terry and Richard Terry how to do
their jobs, and Holland how to run
the athletic department, Would the
professors want Hollandtelling the
history department which courses
they should teach or Dean Terry
deciding that minus grades should
be eliminated? I suggest that fac-

ulty members take a hard look at © ~

their own behavior before they criti-
cize others. People in glass houses
shouldn’t throw stones.

‘ umn willamply demonstrate, we’re

on board for good.

Which brings us (since this
column has NO NARRATIVE
CONTINUITY) to Director of
Residence Life Terry and his ever-

changing housing policy. Thanks
Richard. Yourdecisiontosuspend °

dorm clusters will further endear
you to the school’s loving rabble.
Take away lofts, toilet paper deliv-
ery, and recycling cans and what
have you got...domestic eunuchs.
Sorry girls, but the metaphor is
appropriate to describe the creep-
ing and invidious withdrawal of
basic services that will eventually
immasculate us all. Down with
Residence Life!

Now, we'll end this puppy
with a snappy rejoinder. Let’s
reflect on Robert Frost-and his
snowy woods (the flakes are fall-
ing as we write the article):

Whose dorms these are I think
I know :

His house is in Comelius
though

He will not see me acpolng
here

To watch his dorms fill up
with freshmen.

My little horse must think it
queer

To stop without a recycling
bucket near

Between the comptrollers’ and
frozen registrars’

The most expensive evening
of the year (tuition’s due).

He gives his harness bells a
shake

To ask if there is some mis-
take.

The only other sound’s the
sweep

Of low-paid hourly workers
cleaning Chambers. .

The dorms are fetid, dark and

deep,

But I have paper deadlines to
keep

And reams to write before I
sleep

And reams to write before I
sleep.

An Alabama court recently
ruled that the Confederate Battle
Flag may not be flown above the
state Capitol in Mongtomery. Geor-
gia Governor Zell Miller is head-
ing a movement to change his
state’s flag, which contains the
Battle Flag. Each case has gener-
ated conflict.and intensified feel-
ings; one. must look at historical
precedents to understand the true
significance.,

In 1963, one of the great con-
troversies in America dealt with
desegregation of public schools.
George C. Wallace, governor of
Alabama at the time, was strongly
against desegregation. In order to
flaunt his position in the presence
of Attorney General Robert
Kennedy, who was coming to Ala-
bama, Wallace raised the Battle
Flag over the Capitol.

~ When the court decided that
current Governor Guy Hunt could
nolonger fly the flag, the basis was
an obscure 1895 law which stated
thatonly the official state flag could
be flown in Montgomery. Hunt
had publicly been in favor of rais-
ing the Battle Flag and has sug-
gested that he may push for a pub-
lic vote to attempt to overturn the
court ruling.
Georgia’s legislature altered
its state flag, which did not previ-
ously have the Battle Flag, in 1956.
This gesture was made as a result

‘Past Shows Flag is Racist

of the Supreme Court’s 1954 rul-
ing that segregation of public
schools was unconstitutional. As it
would be in thecase of its neighbor
to the west in seven years, the
Confederate Battle Flag was used

by the legislature in Georgia as a

symbol of racial segregation.

Completely banning the Con-
federate Battle Flag is certainly a
breach of the First Amendment. In
viewing the situations in Alabama
and Georgia, however, history sup-
ports the removal of the symbol
from the Alabama Capitol and the
Georgia state flag. Each state be-
gan using the Flag in direct re-
sponse to national attempts at de-
segregation. When asked if he
would have flown the Flag had
Wallace not done so in 1963, Hunt
replied, “Probably not.”

Alabama and Georgia have
used the Confederate Battle Flag
in the past to symbolize their com-
mitments to segregation. Regard-
less of the Flag’s meaning today,
the precedents have been set. “We
need to lay the days of segregation
to rest,” claims Miller. Keeping
sucha symbol of desegregation off
of the Alabama Capitol and off of
the Georgia state flag seem to be
opportunities to remove reminders
of such separation.

Problem Lies in Social Alienation

Greiling continued hie page 5

Public Defender’s office in Char-
lotte, the vast majority of defen-
dants I see are African-American
men. I realize that my experience
is limited to only one segment of
society, but it is with the most
violent segment. The problem

~ seems to lie more in social alien-:

ation and economics than race, and
these are assuredly issues which
need to be more fully explored. In
making society the “heavy,” are
you saying that people aren’t re-
sponsible for their actions? In see-
ing so many things as examples of
overt racism by the “Establish-

ment,” aren’t you, in effect, rob-
bing people of self-determination
and self-realization? A sense of
victimization only leads to frustra-
tion and powerlessness.
Respectfully,
