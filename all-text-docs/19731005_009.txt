Cool Down To 2-1-1 Record

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

After a fast start, the soccer
team cooled off to a 2-1-1 record
last week.

The team started the season
with an impressive 3-0 victory
over Guilford followed by a 5-2
win over UNC-C.

Last Saturday however, the
Cats could only manage a 3-3 tie
against a good Pfeiffer team.

“‘We looked pretty bad Satur-
day,” said Coach Chip Stone.
“Everyone just stood around
and didn’t hustle at all,’’ Stone
added.

The team followed the Pfeif-
fer game with a 5-0 loss at the
hands of North Carolina.

North Carolina had. a larger
and faster team with several
scholarship players. While
Stone was not pleased with the
Cat’s showing, he nonetheless
felt that they did a good job.

Tornee Possesses Great Desire,

Leads Davidson Soccer Team

By ERNEST BARRY
Staff Writer

To win at any sport, it takes a
team with desire. And for a
team to have desire, that
quality must be found in its
players.

Tom Tornee, one of the co-
captains of Davidson’s soccer
team, has this asset. He is also
optimistic about this year’s
club.

“Chip Stone is doing an ex-
cellent job as head coach,”
praised Tornee. ‘‘If anyone can
turn this: program around, he
will.”

Tornee is especially im-
pressed with the new offensive
system that Stone is im-
plementing this season.

“This is just one example of
his coaching ability,” Tornee
added. ‘“‘The new system is
looking good. We should be able
to move the ball quicker on of-
fense as well as having more
protection on the defensive
side.”’

In this new alignment, Tor-

nee has been moved from his

former position as forward to
the halfback slot.

“It really takes some getting
used to because I have never
played that position before,”’
Tornee commented. ‘The
whole system is coming along
very well, ,

Tornee is equally impressed
with Stone’s scheduling.

‘‘He (Stone) has done a really
great scheduling job,” praised
the Davidson booter. “It is a
tough schedule, but I think we
should do real well.”’

Tornee’s feelings of gratitude
went out to the grounds crew,
who worked during the summer
to improve the soccer field here
at Davidson.

“They did a super job on the
field over the summer,” he
said. ‘‘It is the best field I have
ever played on.”’

Tornee showed his personal
feelings about the sport itself.

“Soccer is loaded with ac-

tion,’ he commented.‘‘It is a
really great spectator’s sport.”

“It is really a boost when
people come out to watch you
play the game,’’ Tornee ex-
plained. ‘‘I hope that more
people will support us this year.
I think we have some ex-
citement in store for them.”’

Tornee has the definite asset
of being optimistic about the
team and its chances for the
coming season. It should be in-
teresting to see how far this
type of feeling carries the Cats
this year.

team we'll play all year andthe
guys were looking forward to
the game,’’ Stone said.

The team purposely set an
ambitious schedule this fall in
hopes of securing an _ in-
dependent bid to participate in
the NCAA playoffs. The North
Carolina game was supposed to
be the team’s toughest test.

The Cats were totally
dominated by the Tarheels
throughout the game. The
Carolina squad was too fast and
too big for the Cats and had
much more .

The Tarheel’s depth ad-
vantage became particularly
evident in the second half when
they were able to substitute
freely and still control the
game.

Goalie John Mitchell had his
best game of the season as Nor-
th Carolina shot on him vir-
tually at will. Several of goals
allowed by Mitchell were just
impossible, shots to stop ac-
cording to Stone.

Tom Tornee was the bright
spot on Davidson’s offense. Tor-
nee was able to get the ball
downfield but never connected
on any of his shots.

The Cats missed several op-
portunities when shots went
wide or were over the goal. In
the words of one Davidson
player, the score was “a lot
closer than 5-0.”

The booters still have an out-
side chance of receiving an
NCAA bid, but they would

probably have to go undefeated
for the rest of the season which
still includes Duke, N.C.State,
and last year’s conference win-
ners, William and Mary.

The team’s next game will be
against East Carolina at David-
son at 2 p.m. on Saturday.
