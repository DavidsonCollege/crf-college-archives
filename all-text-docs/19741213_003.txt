Deaton views the role of
THE DAVIDSONIAN as a

Self Study Examines Changes

By BILL LLOYD
Staff Writer

Early in the 1973-74
academic year the Faculty of
Davidson College elected a
Steering Committee to
organize a Self-Study
in accordance with the
requirements set by the com-
mision on Colleges of the
Southern Association of
Colleges andSchools. .

That committee appointed
ten additional committees to
prepare reports on various

Committee Chairman J.
Harris Proctor, “The Self-
Study report which is
available on reserve in the

ditions and changes over
at Davidson the past ten years’

Davidson next week and the
Self-Study report will serve as
background information for
their subsequent report.

Members of this visiting
committee include officials

from such institutions as Fur-:
man University, Clemson
University, Sweet Briar
College and Radford.

“The main purpose of such
self-study programs is to in-
sure the necessity of the ac-
creditation for in-

even more important in terms
of changes in virtually all
aspects of the workings at
Davidson.

._A review of the last report,
done in 1965, shows such rec-
comendations as a new
library, 4 new curriculum and
elimination of the mandatory
ROTC.

“Many of the self-study
committees last year had
Some students as menibers,
and one committee was com-
prised entirely of students,”
stated Dr. Proctor.

In regard to academics
several observations -were
made concerning grades,
most important being the

’ stricter standards and hence

lower grade-point averages as
compared with other schools.

According to the report, “‘in

: terms of graduate schools, the

combination of Davidson’ s
high standards of admission
and of grading undoubtedly
does its students some disser-
vice.”’

But the committee further
states “that a considerably
larger number of professional
schools to which Davidson
students are admitted still
recognize and allow for the
fact that B’s are harder to get
here than at most in-
stitutions.”

“That committee believes

.that maintaining Davidson’s

traditional grading standards
will best serve its students, in-
cluding those aimed at
graduate and professional
schools.”

In terms of enrollment the
report projects that by 1981,
Davidson will have one
thousand male students and

five hundred female students. _

Additional housing has been
reccommended to deal with
this increase.

Other reccommendations
made by the academic com-

mittee include one that a.

“THE DAVIDSONIAN has
suffered from the lack of
realization by its editors and
staff that we are a weekly’

tistic presentation of issues

“At present, THE DAVID-

got to turn that process
around.

Deaton plans to reorganize
the staff of the paper to even
the work loads and improve
efficiency in publishing.

“I’m hoping the individual

feel a greater sense of respon-

“We have a definite need to
recruit more students to work

readjusting to some extent to
our work with the paper, and
now is:the best time for us to
incorporate new students in
‘DAVIDSONIAN activities.

“We are looking for a more
imaginative approach to jour-
nalism which we hope will
make working for the paper as
well as reading it a more in-
teresting and exciting
process,” Deaton said.

Deaton will begin im-
mediately preparations to

couraged all students in-

designs in graphics to make

want to combine the strengths

with better, more responsible
writing,’’ said Deaton.
