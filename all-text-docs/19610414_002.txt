The Great Schism

The growing alienation between
science and the liberal arts here at
Davidson is becoming frightening. We
are fast being divided into two groups,
roughly distinguished as the pre-meds
and others.

Davidson has a fine pre-med pro-
gram of which we can be well proud.
Graduate schools and prospective stu-
dents are aware of it and more and)
more pre-med majors are drawn to
the campus each year. Actually, the
number is already out of proportion
to the student body enrollment. Even
more serious, however, is the growing
failure to fulfill the true liberal arts
goal.

Pre-meds and other science majors
are swamped by their required science
courses. The old basic required
courses are not sufficient to provide
a real, integrated liberal arts back-
ground, and the science major is un-
‘able to pursue many advanced courses
in the humanities.

Last month, with the faculty's ap-
proval of the new interdepartmental
humanities course, it appeared here
was a partial solution, a means to
bridge the widening gap. By substitut-
ing this for the old program. the
science major could more likely ob-
tain an ‘appreciation of the interrela-
tionship of all knowledge and cul-
ture.” Now, its fate as a possible re-
medy is seriously threatened.

It is no secret that many profes-
sors in the science departments
strongly oppose the new program.
They are perfectly satisfied with the
present science program to the point
of a frank “hands off’’ request to the
faculty. They will not likely encour-

To Catch A Thief

Honor Court Chairman Scott Lacy
says elsewhere on this page that over
$350 has been taken from the dormi-
tories since last September. In addi-
tion, several articles of clothing are
missing, presumably stolen by mem-
bers of the student body.

This comes as a shock to most of
us. Lacy cited one incident of theft
over Midwinters weekend when more
than $100 was stolen from four rooms
on the same hall. He can name other
incidents. And he says his total figure
is a conservative estimate.

Stealing is one of the hardest
crimes to trace on the Davidson cam-
pus. There hasn’t been a _ person
caught for stealing in the four years
that the Senior Class has been here.
But the problem has never been great:
maybe a total of $10 would be missing,
perhaps misplaced, over an entire
year.

Then too. stealing is one of those
practices which cannot be condoned.

age “their boys”. to enroll in the pro-
gram. Yet, without their support, the
program can at most be a hollow suc-
cess. .

The science major, for whom the
course is most needed, is now the one
least likely to take it. He has a serious
scheduling problem which leaves him
with three possibilities according to
Dean Johnston: not take the course at
all; take only one year of it; or take
the second half his junior year.

The first two we would prefer to
dismiss immediately. Only one year
of the course would hopelessly com-
plicate fulfillment of required hours
in English, Bible and history, while
leaving the student with a spotty, in-
coherent program of study.

That leaves the possibility of a jun-
ior year course, which is indeed pre-
ferable if a continuous program is im-
possible. We don’t believe it is. A co-
operative attempt on the part of the
planning committee and science men
to work out a schedule might well
prove successful. One quick sugges-
tion comes to mind — delaying ful-
fillment of the language requirement
until the junior year. Whether the
humanities comes in the sophomore or
junior year willing support from the
science departments is still essential.

The course will necessitate careful
planning. Similar ones have failed in
many schools. While the intensive pre-
paration outlined by Dean Johnston
is encouraging, we hope foremost at-
tention will be given to the pre-med’s
dilemma and definite provisions made
enabling him to complete the full two-
year course. Otherwise, the hopeful
remedy will only serve to drive deeper
the wedge of separation.

Most of us take it for granted that, at
Davidson, we are in the company of
fairly honest people. Indeed, anyone
who locks his room is considered pret-
ty much an oddball. If we ever stop to
think about it, we are usually proud
that our honor system makes it possi-
ble to leave doors unlocked.

The situation has changed. appar-
ently. However much we may deplore
the change, we agree that it’s high
time we knew about it. It’s time, too
to change our attitude toward the Hon-
or Court’s efforts to enforce our own
honor system.

Lacy’s court has done a commend-
able job this year in other areas of
study. (See story on page one). But, as
is usually the case, student coopera-
tion has been nil. Real enforcement of
the honor system is up to the student
body itself. Maybe more of us will
realize this when our own cash is
stolen. But why tempt a thief? The
time to use a little precaution is now.

The Artist Series’ Role

This week the new Reynolds Lec-
tureship Series brought astronomer
Harlow Shapley on campus as its final
presentation in the highly-successful
1960-1961 series. He won the same ac-
tive student interest enjoyed by the
two other distinguished lecturers in
the series, Archibald McLeish and
Arnold Toynbee.

The Artist Series, on the other
hand, suffered this year from a lack of
student support as indicated by the
limited attendance at most of its six
presentations. Despite a good crowd at
the finale production, “Volpone” last
Friday night, it looks like a bleak sea-
son in retrospect.

One reason for this apathy might
lie in the type of programs presented.
As the college catalogue states, about
half the numbers are concerts; the oth-
ers “feature personalities in the fields
of national politics, international af-
fairs, science, literature, and the arts.”

The Artist Series could better live
up to what its name implies by spon-
soring musical, dance, and drama pro-
grams, leaving the lecture-type pro-
gram to other organizations on cam-
pus.

A score of organizations bring lec-
turers during the year; the Artist
Series should concern itself with con-
certs, not speakers.

The main problem facing the series.
every year concerns finances. Their
small budget cannot bring six or seven

well known, highly paid performances
to Davidson, so the Committee con-
centrates on “performers on their way
u ” '

A high price tag does not neces-
sarily promise a higher quality pro-
gram, but we hope the committee will
consider booking fewer than the cus-
tomary six or seven performances if
this step can bring programs that
would make the series more vital.
More tickets would be sold at the ‘door
if top-notch performers were booked.
This would permit the series to oper-
ate on a higher budget.

The role of the Artist Series should
be to educate the student’s cultural
taste through programs by which he
is enlightened as well as entertained.
Perhaps the two students recently
added to the committee, Alden Miller
and Joe Robinson, can make the series
more alive with their suggestions on
this point.

The Artist Series does not have the
same role as the IFC Concert Series,
but we believe students would be more
ready to attend a modern jazz con-
cert than an operetta.

The Artist Series is in competition
with scores of other activities for a
portion of each student’s time. By giv-
ing consideration to the ideas of the
students on the committee and by lim-
iting the programs to music, dance,
and drama performances, the Artist
Series can be made more valuable.

Help!.............. By Howell

Judge Of Honor Court
Views Thett Problem

No one needs to be told
that “one rotten apple will
spoil the barrel.” This is an
old cliche, yet it is one that
has much application to our
situation at Davidson. There
is at least one “rotten apple”
here, and, in spreading his in-
fluence throughout the stu-
dent body, he is destroying
something very vital to this
college, the Honor System.

There are many things that
are wrong with it. There are
the frequent “dives” of tests
or the copied book reports,
but things such as these do
not pose the greatest threat.
Stealing is our biggest pro-
blem. and the longer it con-
tinues, the more ineffectual
our System becomes.

PROBLEM GROWS

In the past. year and a half
the thievery problem has got-
ten ridiculously out of hand.
Over $350 has been taten
from the dorms since last
September, in addition to

many valuable items of cloth-
ing.

It is the opinion of us on
the Honor Court that most of
the money, and at least some
of the clothing, was stolen by
students. Unfortunately, we
have been unsuccessful in

catching the thief. We have
failed for two reasons.

In the first place we have
neither the time nor the
training to do an efficient
job of sleuthing. Secondly,
and most important, we have
found that the average Da-
vidson student inadvertently
places barriers in our path.

STUDENTS CARELESS

Most of you students take
it for granted that the Honor
System works. You think
nothing of leaving your wal-
lets lying on the bed or in
some other equally conspicu-
ots spot. You leave your
rooms open and pay no heed
to strangers roaming the hall.
All this would be possible if

Qualifications Listed
For Peace Corpsmen

BY JOHN RICKS

(Editor’s Note: John
Ricks attended the National
Peace Corps Conference
during spring vacation at
Washington. in Monday's
assembly, he presented a
summary of the program to
date. Below he lists certain
of the qualifications to be
considered by Peace Corps
applicants.)

In order to have the same
standards of admission all
over the United States, there
are going to be selection
boards in various regions.
These will be under the sup-
ervision of a National Selec-
tion Board. To make sure that
the Regional Selection Board
gets the volunteers who are
best suited for work in a cer-
tain country, one of its mem.
bers will be from that coun-
try.

CRITERIA

Criteria for selection in-
clude:

Age-minimum 18. The em-
phasis is placed on youth be-
cause younger volunteers
have not formed as rigid re-
action patterns to situations
and therefore remain more
flexible. However, in some
situations, maturity and ex-
perience are very much need-
ed, and therefore older vol.
unteers have a place in Peace
Corps plans.

Race, religion, sex — These
would normally play no part
in selection. However, the
Peace Corps doesn’t want ap-
plicants who desire to repress
any people’s effort to raise
themselves, and it doesn’t
need those who want to in-
sult a local religion and im-

pose their own on the natives.

Sometimes a person's race or
religion might be considered
in determining where he can
serve the best. For example,
it would be sheer tom-foolery
to send a Negro to South
Africa or a Jew to Saudi Ara-
bia.

EDUCATION

Education—The basic edu-

cational requirement would
be a diploma ‘from high
school or trade school.
_ Physical requirements —
The living conditions to
which the Peace Corps mem-
ber will be subjected are
such that physical fitness and
stamina are necessary. For
example, when some of our
raw Army recruits moved in-
to areas in South east Asia
during World War I, they
had 40 per cent casualties in
a couple of weeks because of
the intestinal parasites and
difficult living.

Abilities, personality-By in-
terviews, tests, recommenda-
tions and records of past ex-
perience, volunteers will be
examined as to these quali-
ties: Motivation, physchologi-
cal maturity, cultural em-
pathy (appreciation of the
foreign society and accept-
ance of their customs), the
ability to learn languages and
communicate clearly, and
seriousness of purpose.

we had an Honor System that
functioned at 100%  effi-
ciency; but we don’t; and
trustfulness has become a
luxury we can no longer af-
ford.

I am not appealing to you
to become amateur Dick

Tracys, I only want to bring
‘the situation to your at-
tention and appeal to you to
use more discretion in your
safeguarding of valuables.

SHAMEFUL

It is shameful that an ar-
ticle like this should ever
have to be printed in THE
DAVIDSONIAN. Ordinarily
we would keep it quiet, but
due to the gravity of the situ.
ation, we felt it would be bet-
ter to inform all of you of
the problem. It is too bad we
should have to endure such
a snake-in-the-grass, but since

he is very much a harsh real-
ity, please be careful.

Davidson Truly Guards
Ideal Of Free Speech

By ERVIN DUGGAN

It happened in South Carolina, a proud state settled
by dissenters — the Huguenots — and cherishing a his-
tory of dissent herself. e.

it happened in the State which honors the mem-
ory of James Petigru, a Charlestonian who stood
bravely against his fellow-citizens in the Revolution
—- and won their respect for his firmness.

It happened in the State who long ago welcomed to
her seminary a Darwinist preacher who had been scorned
as a radical in other states.

In the legislative chambers of South Carolina two
weeks ago Frank Porter Graham was labelled a “radi-
cal” and a “leftist,” all but a corrupter of youth.

And Winthrop College was officially censured by
the Legislature for allowing Dr. Graham to speak his mind
on the Negro sit-in movement.

It is significant to note that the Legislature made
no attempt to refute Dr. Graham’s views. There was
never a rebuttal — only the official condemnation.
The gentlemen did not act in the manner of cham-
pions of the right determined to set the record
straight; they responded unreasonably, emotionally,
childishly, like men afraid. ;

And now their action is defended by some as “in
no way contrary to the ideal of academic freedom or the
guarantee of free speech.” . ;

Academic freedom, say the defenders, is not for
“crackpots.” And what the South Carolina legislature
does, they assert, is the business of South Carolina and
her people.

Such a defense is at best questionable.and at worst
foolish. .

For who is competent to select and censor the ‘‘crack-
pots” of today?

Socrates was a “crackpot” who died for corrupt-
ing the impressionable youth of Athens with his up-
setting ideas.

The early American settlers were religious crackpots
who came seeking freedom and stayed to establish this
country as a refuge for heretics and a lighthouse of
lib

erty.

Thomas Edison was a crackpot. And Henry Ford.
And Woodrow Wilson. ;

And in the old tradition of narrow-minded men, the
lawmakers of South Carolina have condemned a “crack-
pot” again, as they did a few years ago when they forced
the resignation of a dean in their university who dared
question segregation.

They have failed to see that education must
move on the wide road of free discussion, whether it
be midnight bull sessions in the dormitory, heated
clashes in the classroom, or one man’‘s statement of
his Convictions to an audience of “impressionable”
youths.

Is the business of the legislature the business of
South Carolina alone? Certainly not.

When any legislature threatens free speech — even
the speech of a “crackpot” — the threat is against all of
us, not merely against the people of that state.

Frank Graham advocated no treason. .

He said at Davidson exactly what he said at Win-
throp. And here, he was not condemned. His hearers,
almost all of them intelligent conservatives, rejected
his opinions but apptauded his concern and his deep
sincerity; they treated him as gentlemen should
treat a gentleman.

When Frank Graham on his visit to Davidson called
this college “a temple of freedom and of religion,” some
of us doubted him a bit.

But now we are indebted to the gentlemen in Colum-
bia for proving us wrong.

Davidson College, by comparison at least, is a temple
of freedom. We should be proud of that — and guard
the doors of the temple to keep them open, and keep
kindled the light.in the temple, and cherish the learned
crackpots who are priests of the temple where. liberty has
arisen.

SALEMITES

Dear Editor,

For the past two months,
Salem students have begun to

look beyond their brick
walks, ivy-covered walls, and
ancient traditions. On March

23, the student body voted
overwhelmingly to adopt

twelve refugee students for
next year.

Each class will sponsor
three students, providing
scholarships for their edu-
cation in their native coun-
tries. This program will be
financed by class and or-
ganizational projects.

We, the sophomores, are
planning a sloppy, soapy

spectdcular: a Car-Wash! —
and this, dear Davidsonians,

is your opportunity to see
sharp Salemites, circle-pins
and all, on their hands and
knees washing your car! (if
not your car, any car you
can bring-)

If you’ve ever had a good
date at Salem, isn’t this an
excellent way to show your
appreciation?

If you've dated nothing

but losers here, wouldn’t it
be satistying to see them
lowered to the position of
scrubwomen? This rare op-
portunity plus music and
refreshments is yours for
only twenty thin dimes!
Seriously, we do hope that
you will bring your cars to
Salem to be washed on Sat-
urday, April 15 between ten
and four, for the success of
this project is vitel to our
refugee adoption program!
The Sophomore Class, the en-
tire student body, and twelve
refugee students will be
grateful to you!

Dear Editor,

In response to Ervin Dug-
gan’s article on Charley Reed
several weeks ago, I would
like to point out that the
situation at Davidson isn’t
completely hopeless. There
are still a few individuals
that have not “been frozen
out by the icy blasts of colle.
giate coolness.”

The past ROTC drill period
of March 28 was supposedly

proached by the serious faces
of the cadre and awarded 25
demerits for his efforts.

This cadet may fail ROTC,
but he has proved that there
are a few individuals at Da-
vidson willing to stand up for
their beliefs. In the “serried
rows” of “identical plants”
there are a few unpulled
weeds, and I say hats off to
them.
