son, is now pastor of the celebrated New
Bern Presbyterian Church, of New Bern,
N. C., which has just held its centennial

celebration. i

Doctor Summerell is a member of the
class of ’73, which produced many other
distinguished men, among them J. L.
Chambers, a highly successful business
* man of Charlotte, and John D. Bellamy,
Jr., who’ was state congressman and aft-
terwards senator.

Doctor Summerell received ari A.M.
degree at Davidson in 1876 and also
holds a D.D. degree. He is a graduate of
Union Theological Seminary, and was a
student for a year at New College, Edin-
burgh, Scotland.

Rev. W. A. Nisbet, 1887, has moved
from San Antonio, Tex., to West Co-
lumbia, Tex.

Rev. and Mrs. Locke White, 1913, have

are now at work;

Dr. Harold M. Marvin, 1914, is on the

by Rev. W. T. Thompson, D.D., 1905.
Dr. Thompson is now the Professor of
Keligious Education in Union Theologi-
cal Seminary, Richmond, Va.

A very interesting: pamphlet on diph-

handsomely designed cards, on which
}are printed verses in which the lines end
| with love and dove or dart and heart, and
jon which many candidates for the state
{asylums also send abusive and idiotic
| colored sheets, vulgarly known as
| comics.

Why the day should be dedicated to
|St. Valentine or why he should have
| been chosen as the patron saint of lovers
jor what connection or relationship he
|had to Cupid no historian, antiquarian,
scientists or writer of any kind has ever
been able to explain, and the matter is as
much a mystery as “who found the
knife.”

What is known about him is this: He
jwas cither a priest or a bishop of the
| early Christian church at the time when
| the Roman empire was reigned over by
| Marcus Aurelius Claudius, who figures in
| Roman history as Claudius II, and he

churches in North and South Carolina, |
Kentucky and Virginia. Among his

North Carolina pastorates are Tatboro.| Mr. W. M. Cumming, of Wilmington, | religion,

Rocky Mount, Washington, and Wilson, |
in the castern part of the state.

Dr. Summerell has been intimately con-
nected with Davidson both as a teacher
and as a trustee. He was a teacher here |
from 1873 until 1877, He is a man of
dignified manner but very genial. He
is a strong, sturdy man and stands erect.
He has always been a good friend of
Davidson.

N. C., August 31,.1854. “He*is a gratndson
of Dr. Elisha Mitchell, for whom the
famous peak (highest east of the Rock-

ies) in western North Carolina was

The persecution of the Christians was
favorite diversion with Marcus Au-
jrelius Claudius, and he was a prolific
jcreator of martyrs, so that when the
priest or Bishop Valentine did all he
knew how to relieve the distress and
sufferings among his persecuted follow-
ers the Emperor grew wroth and ordered
| him into custody, naming Calpurnius, the
lchief officer of the city government, as
his responsible custodian, with orders
that he be no longer permitted to preach
the new Gospel and decry the gods of
| Rome.

| Calpurnius in turn deputized his chief
lof staff, one Asterius by name, to take
immediate charge of Valentine and keep
him safely locked up, and in order to do
so Asterius had him imprisoned in his
own house, probably in the cellar.

But that did not discourage Valentine
for, finding no one about but the slaves
of Asterius, he preached to them with
all his fervor and promptly converted
them to his way of regarding the here-
after and their duty to the Almighty.
This so impressed Asterius that he was
disposed to believe in the new rejigion
himself, but being still skeptical, he told
his prisoner that if he would restore the |
sight of his blind daughter and thus/|
prove his divine teaching, he could en-
roll Asterius among his converts and go

Valentine, and when the news spread
through Rome it created considerable of
a sensation. The Emperor was furious
and sent to the house of Austerius to)
have Valentine brought before him, but |
he had been freed and gone away. ‘It|
was within a short time, however; that|
he was captured by the soldiers ~who}|
were sent to find him, and when they|
found him on the Flaminian Way, not!
far from Rome, they beat him cruelly
with clubs and ended by chopping off
his head.

That tragedy occurred either February
14. 269 A. D., or on the same day one
year later, some authorities leaning to
one date and others to the other.

And there is not another atom of evi-
dence regarding the life of St. Valentine,
so it is not to be wondered at that the
modern world is mystified as to why his
name, and the day of his death, should
have become associated with the great
annual feast day of lovers.—Selected.
