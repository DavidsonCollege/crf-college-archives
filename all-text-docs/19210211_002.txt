THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 11, 1921.

Athletic News
Speaking of Sports

Well—the bunch met their match last
week in Virginia, and it was just a case
of the best team winning. All the lit-
tle bad breaks that follow a team on the
road, were present, however, and helped
te mix matters worse.

Wildcats

A compact summary of the scores
show:

Virginia 47, Davidson 23.

Elks Club 37, Davidson 23.

Washington and Lee 32, Davidson 28.

The improvement as they went is en-
-couraging, and simply emphasizes what
Coach Grey said last fall about Red and
Black teams, “They may be defeated,
but they are never beaten.”

Wildcats.

“Billy” Roberts led the offensive at-
tack of the Wildcats scoring 40 of his
teams 74 points.

“Birchie” Romefelt sustained an injury
in the Elk’s Club game, and was bother-
ed during the remainder of the trip.

The return of Coach Hengeveld, after
a two weeks sickness, means that from
now on the old “Gym” will be worked to
death under his direction. Glad to see
you out Dutch.

And while our cohorts were on their

GIRLS PLAY BASKETBALL
ON THE COLLEGE COURT

In an evenly matched contest of
snappy basketball the girl’s team from
Derita won from the Davidson five by
the score of 25 to 19. Both teams played
well and just which one would come out
victorious was uncertain until the very
end. Several times the score was tied
but each time Derita was able to score
and gain the lead again.

Hunter and Jordan ware easily the
stars for Derita and Evelyn Potts for
Davidson. The fatter bringing cheers
from the gallery again and again by her
ability to find the basket.

Not much happened with our state
opponents last week. Elon trimmed
Wake Forest on the former home floor
by an 18 to 15 score. This evens the
series between these two schools; W.
F. winning on their own floor by a 16

Gallery practice started this week in
preparation for the competition between
colleges which lasts from February 28th
to March 12th. There will be ten men
selected from the basic and ten from the
advanced course. The scores of these
men at the different positions; prone,
sitting, kneeling and standing will be
sent in to the Corps headquarters and
a list of the winners will be announced.
The scores will be as accurate as pos-
sible with an army officer in charge.
A challenge has been received from the
Ninth Corps Area out on the Pacific
Coast to compete with the winner. The
teams standing first, second, and third,
both in the Junior and Senior competi-
tions, will be given an opportunity to
compete with the winners of the Ninth
Corps.

Wildcats
As things look now in the race for
state championship honors, Trinity
seems to have a slight edge in some
respect, but on the other hand either
the University or Davidson may be
counted in the running.
Wildcats
Trinity has won all of her intercol-
legiate games so far, although her win
over the University was by only two
points; her win over N. C. State on her
home floor was by only 22 points com-
pared to our 37 point advantages over
the same team.
Wildcats
Wake Forest may still be considered
a contender as her defeat at the hands
of Trinity on her home floor, by only
7 points would indicate her strength.
Wildcats
Guilford, N. C. State and Elon are
practically eliminated. As it stands it
seems to be a three cornered fight be-
tween Trinity, University, and David-
son, with the odds on the former.
Wildcats
This weeks’ schedule calls for:
Thursday 1oth.
U.N. C. vs. Elk’s Club, at Lynchburg.
Wake Forest vs. Guilford, at Wake
Forest.
Davidson vs. University of Florida, at
Davidson.
Friday 11th.
N. C. State vs. Guilford, at Raleigh.
Davidson vs. Citadel, at Davidson.
Saturday 12th.
N. C. State vs. Wake Forest, at Wake
Forest.
Trinity vs. Guilford, at Durham.
Sunday 1gth-——Bad luck on 13th, so all
teams rest up.

According to a new regulation issue
of shoes to the R. O. T. C. has been dis-
continued and all shipments of shoes
cancelled. No further requisition of
shoes will be sent in by the R. O. T. C.
commanders.

Among the Seniors at Georgia Tech,
33 out of 37 who graduate in June have
agreed to accept commissions in the
Officer’s Reserve Corps, of this number
11 have applied for six months active
service. These officers will be among
the first of the output of the R.O. T. C
and much is expected from them.

ELKS CLUB GAME.

Playing before a large crowd in the
City Auditorium in Lynchburg, Virgina,
last Thursday night, the Wildcats were
defeated by the Elk’s Club team of that
city, by the score of 37-23. The Elks
Club quint was composed of veteran
players and were well supplied with
substitutes just as good as those on the
first team. The local aggregation failed
to display their usual brand of ball and
were decidedly inferior in passing to
their opponents.

The Wildcats did not score in the
initial frame until they had eight black
marks up against them, and were fur-
ther handicapped in this half by the
injury of Romefelt. Their passing was
not working up to form and at the
sounding of the first bell they were on
the little end of a 20-5 score.

In the second half the Elks put in an
entire new team, which they styled the
“Wrecking Crew.” It proved to be
nearly as capable as their predecessors,
but met with harder opposition, for as
the game progressed the Davidsonians
got together more and more, and scored
regularly toward the end. They out-
played the second team by one point,
but this was not sufficient to alter the
previous lead of the Elks and the final
score was 37-23.

Shaner, the Elk center, was the shin-
ing light for his team, putting up a
pretty exhibition, while Bill Roberts did
most of the scoring and played the
best game for the losers.

The line-up and summary is as fol-
lows:

Washington and Lee Game.

The Red and Black five fell victims of
the Generals on the latter’s floor fast
Friday night in a hotly contested game
by a score of 31 to 28. Davidson opened
up with such speed and accurate pass-
ing that they were able to net nine
points before the W. and L. five realized
what they were ‘up against.

The scoring was done in shifts after
this, first Davidson making several
points and then W. and L. coming up to
their lead. Neither team allowed the
other to take a very strong lead and the
first half ending 21 to 16 in the Wild-
cat’s favor.

In the second half the Generals came
back strong with good passing and fast
team work. However they were unable
to leave Davidson far in the rear and
only won the game in the last two
minutes of play.

Roberts for Davidson led both teams
in scoring and was the Presbyterian’s
mainstay during the entire game. J.
Schenck was a close second, netting ten
points. Crawford's work at guard is
also worthy of note. Romefelt, David-
son’s stalwart center played a good
game until he was forced to retire on
account of an injury received the night
before.

McDonald and Harris lead the Gen-
erals in scoring and assisted by Ste-
phens, whose floor work and passing
was the most noticible feature of the
game, carried their colors to victory.
The shooting of both teams was rag-
ged.

REV. J. ANDREW SMITH
OCCUPIES PULPIT SUNDAY

Preaches on Salvation From Sin

Thro F;
nt Room

Rev. J. Andrew Smith, evangelist from
South Carolina, spoke Sunday morning
on the three fundamental elements of
salvation: Faith, Repentance, and Love.

By way of introduction the speaker
showed that there can be no salvation
apart from Christ, because of our sin,
our unregenerate hearts and our un-
belief. But if we have faith in Christ
and repentance for our sins, we may
know that we have salvation, not “in
sin” but “from sin.”

Mere historical belief in the fact that
there was a Christ is not sufficient, nor
is intellectual assent to the doctrine of
His Divinity enough. We must pin our
whole faith on Him and mould our ac-
tions according to our belief in His
teachings.

Reformation, the speaker continned, is
not regeneration. We cannot substi-
tute good works, or even preaching, for
real repentance. Repentance is a grace
enabling us to see sin thru God’s eyes.

When he have a vision of Christ we will
not compromise with sin, but we will
flee the very appearance of sin.

Finally, we should crown our newly
surrendered lives with love, both for
God and for our fellow men, for “if we
love not our brother whom we have
seen, how shall we love God whom we
have not seen.”
