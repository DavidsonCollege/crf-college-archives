tional facility that will’ be just three miles west of the college.

Lake Norman, with 450 miles
of shoreline which wil! make it
larger than all of the other
lakes in Duke Power's Catawba
system combined. has made it
necessary to raise the level of
United States Highway 21, thus
the detour through Davidson.
But more important to students
is the fact that the college has
taken steps to see that the op-
portunity for land of its own on
the lake is not passed up.

“Davidson has made a timely
request to Duke Power to lease
some lakefront property,’ Rob-
ert Currie, business manager for
the college said. “Since at least
twenty thousand names are on
the list for leases, the early re-
quest we made could be import-
ant. And because Duke Power
officials are interested in the
school, I don’t think we will
have any trouble in securing
some property.”

Currie said that Duke Power knows, the college has never

is only leasing
property arid not selling it.

Currie stressed that the land
leased would be for the recrea-
tion of the students and faculty
of the college. “Just what the
college will do on its property
will depend upon the commer-
cial facilities around us,” he
said.

“We would not try to operate
something that two or three
commercial ventures next door
to us were trying to operate.
We will attempt to secure out-
side advice as to what use of our
land will best fill the needs of

fraternity holding land off
campus. ‘T could not possibly
say at this time what the atti-
tude of the college might be
toward fraternity property on

the lake.”

Or. William G. Workman, the
new chairman of the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities,
Clubs, and Social Life, said that
the question would be brought
up today in a meeting of the
committee.

Old Hotel
25th, Too

BY RICK VON UNWERTH
Davidsonian Feature Editor

The old Carolina Inn, though virtually unnoticed by
Davidson, 1s observing its 125th anniversary along with

Davidson College.

It has accommodated persons
ranging from Hinton Rowan
Helper. author, of the renown-
ed “The Impending Crisis,” to
fraternity houseparty dates in
the 1920's.

Davidson College bought the
building in 1946 with the intent
to restore it as a hotel for visit-
ors of the College. Nothing was
done about it, however, and the
first floor was taken over seven
years ago to be converted into
the oresent Davidson Teen.Can-
teen.

The structure was built as a
private residence in 1837 by the
Dinkens family. In 1855. it was
purchased by Hanson Pinkney
Helpe->. and four years later was.
furnished as an Inn, known as
“Helper House.”

Hinton Rowan Helper, the
owner's brother, visited the Inn
and the Davidson campus sev-
eral times before he was forced
to seek asylum in the North
upon publication of “The Im-
pending Crisis.” His book was a
frank appraisal of the economic

Council Ponders

Gambling, Bounds |

The Student Council spent the
majority of its Wednesday night
meeting attempting to clarify
the Student Body Regulations
concerning gambling and the
limits of the college campus.
These questions were postponed
until next week's meeting to al-
low more time for consideration
of them by the council mem-
bers.

Council also discussed the
possibility of having a student
representative on the Academic
Scheduling Committee. Dissen-
sion on some of the committee’s
scheduling for this year em-
phasized the need for student
representation in this field.
President George Trask noted
that a representative to the
committee would serve in a
non-voting capacity.

John Killian and Dave Olin
were appointed by the council
as a committee to attempt to
find a more effective method of
handling the gun room.

and social structure of the South
under its slave labor system.

Soon after. it was published,
the North Carolina State Legis-
lature enacted a law prohibit-

‘ting the sale or possession of the

volume in this state. The book
is said to have been used ex-
tensively in the Republican
presidential campaign of 1860.
President Lincoln. soon after,
appointed him to the ambassa-
dorship of a Latin American
country.

Helper House kept travelling
men and college visitors until
1902. and its owner was the
postmaster of Davidson during
much of this time. Dr. Lingle, !
former president of the college, |
used to play backgammon with
Helper. while a student here in
the 1880's.

In 1902 the building was sold
to the Sloan family, and main-
tained as a lodging house by
Mrs..‘Sarah Sloan (Sadie) Bo-,
hannon. It became popular dur-
ing the 1920's as a weekend

‘rooming house for Davidson
.dates to the fraternity house

parties.

It was known as the Carolina
Inn from the early 1930's unti) it
was purchased. by Davidson Col-;
lege in 1946.

Helper House, or Carolina
Inn, has been renovated partial-
ly and is now used on Wednes-
day afternoons and Saturday
nights as a gathering place for
the Davidson community teen-
agers. It provides a room for
dancing, game rooms, pool
tables, and other recreation
equipment, and is open to all
young people in the seventh
through the twelfth grades.

The Teen-Canteen 1s directed;

by Mr. and Mrs. E. T. MeEver,
and the YMCA provides student
assistance for the project.

Mrs. McEver said that she
wasn’t sure whether the college

“plans to restore the hotel or|

tear it down.”

Whatever its future, David-
son's hotel has withstood time,
war, and the ravages of David-
son’s youth, right alongside the
college, for a century and a
quarter.

The dam is expected to be

to grant leases upon completion
of the dam. The lake will not
have finished filling until 1963
however.

“For the past several sum-

said Dr. Jackson. “OASU is a

professors from various col-
leges and universities, mainly
Duke, Carolina, and State. It
works on Air Force projects for

current Berlin crisis, which did
not crystallize until later, but
he remarked, ‘Tt is strange to
seé pictures of areas of Berlin,

which were freely accessible

He also noted that the Ger-

but as allies, and they cooperate
with each other, both officially
iand unofficially, to the fullest
extent.

meaning.

-It is assumed that the David-
son student has, in earlier years,
learned both the value of hon-

-esty and (in Mr. Papra’s words)

. ... why he should be honest
in his own dealings, and be a-
lert to the honesty of others.”

For this reason, those who
violate the Honor System not
only commit an infraction of a
single rule, but indicate their
unwillingness to abide by the
virtue of honor in all phases of
their life here.

Such people have no place at
Davidson.

Mr. Papra alsu proposed cer-
tain revisions in the System.
One such proposal was that
student theft cases be tried in
criminal courts. The Honor
Court is not interested in theft
as a crime against society, but
as a sign of dishonor.

days he and Linker will both be
on duty during these hours
while Smith learns the routine
of the job: “There. are eleven
masterkeys a new man has to

‘learn and also the various build-

ings,” stated Linker who will be
on duty in the afternoon and
early evening, .

Before coming to Davidson,
Smith spent over 20 years in
the Army with overseas duty in
Japan, Korea, and Europe, serv-
ing in the Medical Corps. For
his service he received several
awards including the Bronze
Star. “Being a retired Army
man he’s had a lot of time to
deal with people,” says Cop
Linker.

Smith says that he’s a little
apprehensive about Homecom-
ing weekend, but will try to be
as fair as possible in any in-
stances of rule infractions.
“There are some people who get
boisterous when they overin-
dulge. If a fellow is quiet and

just goes up to his room, he
probably will not be noticed.”

—’Turning someone in for be-
ing intoxiceted is the last thing
we want to do,” says Linker who
has had 22 years experience as
Davidson security officer.

Smith received his high school
education in Tabor City, N. C.
and obtained a junior college
degree through Army study. In
recent years he served on the
faculty of the Army Medical
Field Services School where
units from all areas of the world
are trained by the Medical
Corps.

Since his retirement from the
Army in 1954, Smith has worked
as a crew leader in the Texas
Forest Service and as a filling
station operator. Smith feels
that he is qualified to be an
hospital administrator, but says
that the over-staffed conditions
of most hospitals make it diffi-
cult to find this type of work.

dent D. Grier Martin has rec-
ognized the fact that there are
no local facilities for golfers.
This range will provide facilities
for golf enthusiasts as well as
additional recreational facilities
for the college.

For the present, the driving
range schedule is to be on a
tentative basis. The hours are to
be from 2 p.m. to a half hour
before dark on weekdays, and
from 10 a.m. to a half hour be-
fore dark on Saturdays. Stud-
ents must furnish their own
clubs, but golf balls will be

rented at 25 cents per bucket.

For the opening, several
members of the college will be
on hand to hit the first balls.
Among these will be President
and Mrs. Martin, Deans Frontis
Johnston and Richard Burts,
IFC President Bob Waugh, Stud-
ent Council President George
Trask, and members of the col-
lege golf team.

Several years ago the College
had a golf course on the back
campus. Through the years, how-
ever, the course fell into dis-
use and is no longer maintained.
Since then the closest golfing
facilities have been at Moorés-
