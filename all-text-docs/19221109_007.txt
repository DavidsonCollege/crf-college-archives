THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 9,

1922

ATTENTION! ALUMNI!

The Davidsonian has realized
that for a greater Davidson the
student body and alumni must
keep—in—close touch with each
other and to accomplish this end
the staff is going to devote part
of every Davidsonian to an
alumni feature section. Each
organized chapter or division of
the Alumni Association will, at a
specified time during the year,
have a part of the paper set aside
exclusively for the news-and ac-
tivities of its members. In this
way, all the alumni can keep in
touch with each other.

It is hoped that each alumni
organization will try to make its
section in The Davidsonian the
best. The secretaries of the
organizations in the various cities

. are urged to send in write-ups of
every alumnus in his vicinity.
Please address all information,
including class numerals if possi-

ble, to C. F. Wildman, Davidson,

N. C.

pack in ability to gain ground, and
registered 10 first downs to seven for
the victors, But the Presbyterians had
their old difficulty of making their
yardage count in points. And after all
it’s touchdowns and not first downs
that win games.

Davidson kicked off to Lassiter, who
returned to his 40-yard line before| \
being stopped by Regen. He was
knocked ‘dippy” though not uncon-
scious on this play. On the next play
Lassiter fumbled, Hendrix recovering.
Davidson was penalized five yards for
holding, but Moore got the distance
back and a forward pass, Hendrix to
‘| Davis, carried the ball to State’s 25-
yard mark, A touchdown seemed sure,
but the Lady stepped in.

Regen who had been playing all this
time without knowing what he was
doing, was called upon to go through
the line. He, not realizing that it was
his ball, smashed into the line, the ball
sailed by him. Holland scooped it up
and, before the Wildcats realized what
had happened, planted it safely behind
the goal post.

Another State fumble,
Andy Randolph, gave the Wildcats
their second chance and they bored
straight down the field from the 45-
yard line, making good three forward
passes in a row and planting the ball
on the six-yard line for a first down.

Three rushes netted only two of the
needed six yards and the quarter ended
with the ball on the four-yard line and
but one chance left. Davidson resorted
to a forward pass in a desperate effort
to make the opportunity good, but the
pass was grounded and the ball went
over on downs.

Long’s ‘kick again gave the ball to
Davidson on State’s 45-yard line, but
this was the Wildcats last invasion for
Cox broke through the line
and snatched the ball from Hendrix,
who had dropped back to throw a pass.
State was then penalized 15 ygrds for
holding, but Long got away/the best
punt of the day for 60 aed and Da-
vidson had the ball on its own one-yard
line.

State worked the ball up to the 15-
yard line, featuring a forward pass,
but at that point the Wolfpack began

to draw penalties, several.of which]

were for an excess. number. of “times

this one by|*

outs” and Long missed a drop kick
from the 40-yard line.
DAZZLING FORWARD PASSES

State then got a full dose of the
Presbyterians’ aerial game, but the half
ended after the advance had carried
the hall 45 vards to State’s 25¢yard
line,

The ball see-sawed back and forth in
the third quarter until Lassiter grabbed
a Davidson forward pass and gave his
team a chance that was converted into
a touchdown.

The third quarter ended with State
in possession of the ball. in the exact
center of the field. ‘Two successive
downs put the Wolfpack well in the
enemy's territory and when the ad-
vance was stopped Bobby Long booted
a field goal for three extra points.

MOORE STRUTS TIS STURT

But late in the game, Captain Spratt
Moore turned loose in earnest and
“strutted his stuff” almost the entire
length of the field, slashing off tackle
and cireling around the ends runs tnat
gave meaning to the word “deceptive.”
With Moore’s wriggling and side-step-
ping accounting for every gain except
one T1-vard pass, the ball was placed
on State's 43-yard line, for a total gain
of yards, ‘The \Wildeats then
turned again to the overhead game and
a pass from Tlendrix to Davis netted
20 yards more. — Another pass was
tried, but it was grounded in the end
zone,

Davidson showed a poor forward
pass game, but Moore, the two Davis
brothers and Clark were the outstand-
