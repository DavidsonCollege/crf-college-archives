To Davidson Students, Faculty, and
Administration,
It is my conviction that this campus
_is no fun. Students here seem afraid of
fun. Everyone takes college too serious-
ly. Granted, if.all I wanted to do for my
college years is party, i wouldn’t have
come to Daavidson. I know that the ma-
jority of Davidson students enjoy learn-
ing and school, and that is one of the
best things about this school in my opin-
ion. But it seems to end here. The sup-
posedly elevated reputation of the
school, ‘and the somewhat prehistoric
notion that Davidson “boys” come out
as “gentleman” who need no introduc-
tion, haveprecipitted a holier-than-thou

attitude that is almost unbearable, and. :

obsession (especially on the part of the
administration) to protect Davidson’s
“image.”

Two cases in point. Hattie’s Night,
Davidson’s infamous (and only) blow
out party was scheduled for Thursday
the 25th, but-was cancelled because it
was felt that the party would give the
prospectives visiting for SGA week-end
a bad image of what Davidson is like.
That is a good point. We wouldn’t want
the prospectives to think that we at Da-
vidson ever, even ocassionally (once a
year!), over indulge. I’m sure the pros-

pectives would enoy being treated to a

huge party when they icome up. They
might even come specifically for Hat-
tie’s, Unfortunately, that is not possible
now because no one knows when it is
going to be. It is an incredibly paternal-
istic attitude, and it extends to the stu-
dents too. The point is, theadministra-
tion and the SGA seem to feel that we
have an image ito protect. I'd like to
think we have an.image to destroy.
Another. example of this image dictat-
ing is the cancellation of the assassins
game. Granted, the game is about “kill-
ing,” but mature enough to realize that it
is only a game. My God, it’s only for
fun! Who does it hurt?
These are two very specific examples,
but the problem is evident everywhere.
.And it is not just a lack of scheduled pat-
ties. People around here don’t know
how {o have fun unless it is planned by a
frat or the Union Games Committee. I
have lots of fun, but no ithanks to the
College as a whole. Fun has to be creat-
ed here. If I say to someone, “Let’s do
something tonight,” they always say,
“What?” Why do you have to have a
reason to have fun? Fun is fun. If you
ain’t-got fun, you ain’t got squat.
A friend of mine commented on liow.
wonderful it was here the night of the

Carolina game, because everyone was need your help. as
happy for once. That’s sad. I don’t SHARE
know what it was like because I wasn’t THE COST ,
expecting any fun, so I went to Chapel OF LIVING & .
Hill. Thatwas fun. . Ameri Give fo the i ty

things, I don’t think they will just be-
cause I wish they would. What I want to
say is, it doesn’t have to be this way.
There is nothing wrong with being se-
rious, but don’t take yourself or your job
or your studies too seriously. It leads to
a stiffening of the upper lip and a deflat-
ing of the personality. Remember,
when you’re representing Davidson
College you’re also representing your-
self. Are you really being yourself? Are
you having fun ? Really? Think about
it.
