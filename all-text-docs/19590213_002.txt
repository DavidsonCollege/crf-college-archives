Changes Would
Make Elections
Meaningful

In past years, student body elec-
tions at Davidson have begun with
a bang and ended with a whimper.
Starting in glory with the race for
president of the student body, over
a period of several weeks they creep
along to a muted finish with the elec-
tion of the head cheerleader and the
athletic council, obscure offices for
which rarely more than one tenth of
the. students cast a ballot. Student in-
terest in the whole process of choos-
ing officers of the student ,body
YMCA, and publications has general-
ly been pretty stagnant, with only
about sixty percent bothering to vote
at any balloting.

It has become evident that some-
thing ought to be done to re-awaken
the inferest of the students in their
elections. Student Body President
John Kuykendall took the first step

last fall when he appointed a special-

committee of students. to study the
elections situation. After wisely re-
jecting attempts by a minority to in-
ject the issues of increased party
politics and student campaigning, the
committee decided upon a series of
proposals which it submitted to the
Student Council. Kuykendall also
has drafted a list of recommended
election changes for the Council and
the Elections Board.

By these recommendations, the
order of elections would be changed
to: student body officers, the Honor
Court, Student Council representa-
tives, YMCA officers and publications
editors, and the Freshman Advisor.
Athletic Council members, instead of
elected by the student body. Class
presidents would not be elected
separately but would be taken from
the highest men among council rep-
resentatives in each class.

All of these proposals are sensi-
ble ones, and we feel that they should
be adopted in time to cover the en-
tire course of this spring's elections.
The changes pertaining to the Ath-
letic Council, the head cheerleader,
and class presidents would require
amendment of the student body con-
Stitution: this should be done as soon
as possible,

However, the process of voting
could be sped up somewhat. if pub-
lications editors were elected at the
same time as student body officers.
It is unlikely that any individual
would be running in both races or
would want to wait for the outcome
of one before entering the other. This
would speed up voting, as well as
bring up important offices at a
time when student body interest is
still high. YMCA elections could dou-
ble up with the Freshman Advisor
race.

The elections committee also pro-
posed that three precincts be estab-
lished for voting near the dormitor-
ies. We feel that this also should be
put into effect, since it will allow vot-
ing on the non-chapel days at poll-
ing places closer to the center of stu-
dent activities than the Union (where
this took place last year).

The Council and the Elections
Board should reject, as did the spe-
cial Elections Committee, the notion
of having non-chapel voting at the

fraternity houses during meal time.
This would tend to encourage bloc
voting, and would set a dangerous
precedent.

With the above changes, elections
for student body offices will have a
chance of becoming more meaningful

to a greater number of students.

Our Valentine

Last year the DA-
VIDSONIAN select-
ed Mrs. J. B. Moore
as our “Valentine.”
Again this year her
charm and _ sincere
interest in the wel-
fare of the Student
Body have easily
+. eliminated all com-
ithe petition.

During two and a half years of
service as Supervisor of Dormitories
Mrs. Moore has consistently per-
formed her duties with exceptional
ability and efficiency, but she has
gone beyond this. She has performed
the greater service of being a campus
“mother” to nine-hundred Davidson
men each year.

This is why we want her to be
our “Valentine”. No student has ever
found Mrs. Moore too busy to listen
to his problem, whether it be a dis-
agreeable roommate or a broken date
for dance weekend.

She is always generous with
praise, but gives it meaning with
equally generous reprimands for
messy rooms, cigarette burns on the
floor, and excessive noise.

Most of all we want her to know
that her interest and efforts in our
behalf are appreciated.

The only ways we can really say
it is, “Thank you again, Mrs. Moore.”

A Healthy Sign

Mixing plain talk with a shrewd
humor, Harry Golden told a packed
house of segregation-oriented South-
erners that they were all wrong, and
they listened to every word.

The easiest way to conquer a foe
is to make him look ridiculous, and
that's just what Golden did to white
supremacy. The audience roared with
delight when he gravely asked,
“Would you want your daughter to
marry Orval Faubus?”

We could quote the best selling
author’s humor for columns, but the
Significance of his visit lies elsewhere.

First, it is a sad comment on our
culture when we have to wait for a
frank-speaking New York immigrant
to do any plain talking about a prob-
lem peculiar to our land. With the
exception of Mr. James Dabbs, he
is the only person in this section of
the nation willing to poke fun at
Southern myths, laugh at racists,
“Citizen's Councils,” and all the rest.
Intelligent Southern leadership must
have failed somehow.

Secondly, the packed house that
listened attentively to Golden attests
to the fact that the educated youth
of the South are no longer willing to
hear only the red-necked demagogue.
They want the fullest picture they can
get of the problems facing their coun-
try; they are becoming more willing
to make up their own minds.

Certainly all that came to hear the
“Israelite” editor did not agree with
him; perhaps they left with their
opinions not changed, but they did
come, and they did listen, and they
did think.

We think it’s a healthy sign.

OVER THE SEAS

On “Free Love’’In Scandinavia

On the request of the Editor
of the DAVIDSONIAN I will
now attempt to describe what
in the United States is known
as “free love in Scandinavia.”

As this term has been un-

‘known to me up to now, you

will have to excuse me if my
opinion differs somewhat from
yours. I have a strange feeling
that the Editor has asked the
wrong person to write this ar-
ticle, for I know practically
nothing about the subject com-
pared to most Americans, who
during all these years have re-
ceived accurate information
which is unobtainable in my
home country, and who seem
to be duly shocked.

I did not understand this at-
titude. and this made me be-
lieve that I had come to a coun-
try with traditions similar to
those in the Middle East. Did
girls wear veils? evidently not.

t said to myself, “Since
they don’t wear veils, per-
haps they are goddesses.”
My belief was strongly con-
firmed when | came to Da-
vidson. Never in my entire
life have | seen such an
abundance of goddesses as on
the walls in the rooms of the
dormitories; from Brigette

Bardot in a Bikini to Eliza-
beth Taylor in sun glass-
es...

I got a date. 1 was really
looking forward to this event,
because this, I was sure, would
tell me the cifference between
a Danish girl and an American
girl. Yet I was disappointed.
The difference was the same.

By EBBE JUSTESEN

I went with my “beauty” to
a drive-in. She was cold as a
Frigidaire. (I thought that may-
be we had a little more “free
love” in Denmark after all.) It
was raining. The wipers offered
a very limited view of the
movie-sereen, which was to the
right of the car.

I was double-dating. The girl
in the front seat did not seem
to be a Frigidaire; or at least
her cooling system did not
work, The result was that my
poor date was not able to see
anything because of the width
of the two heads put together.

I moved as far to the right
as possible, and my date fol-
lowed me. Now she could see
— I could not, but all for the
lady.

We had been at the movie
for a quarter of an hour, !
guess, when my Frigidaire
began to melt. It was dark
now, and maybe the defroster
of the car did its job, too.
t felt her shoulders resting
against my breast. | started
to think again, “Oh, she is
so polite that she will say to
me that 1 can come a little
closer so that ! can see, too.”
I moved closer, and diseov-

ered that my date was not able
to see at all from where she
was sitting. She had moved too
far to the right. I looked at
her, she looked at me. I
thought, “It is a tale told by an
idiot.”

The next day I thought to

myself, “God bless my _ wisc
chemistry professor, Dr.

lent.” He had told me about
carbon tetracloride, how it was
able to dissolve different stuffs;
and really he was right. The
lipstick came off my shirt very
easily.

This date did not satisfy my
curiosity; the girl was like most
girls I have met in Denmark.
(And by the way, no later date
has satisfied my curiosity.) The
only difference I have found
is that I have not seen many
friendships between a girl and
a boy here in the U. S. A.

| believe that many of the
American girls — and by the
way, the boys, too — think
that a member of the oppo-
site sex is only something
one cen make love with —-
it cannot be a good friend.
A boy and a girl cannot
have the same interests —
it is acceptable if the only
interest is the opposite sex.

But this is the wrong
point of view. I have had
some of my most wonderful
and enjoyable hours togeth-
er with Danish girls, and 1
have never had to make use
of Dr. Gallent’s wisdom aft-
er such hours.

Maybe it is these meetings,
so natural to us, which are
called “free love.”

Let me sy it so:

A Tete-a-Tete in Denmark is
a meeting between two; a mecet-
ing where two can speak to-
gether.

A Tete-a-Tete in America is
a meeting, too; a meeting —

Gal- but not for talking.

THE PHILOSOPHES

A Vital Message Is Taught.
Through An Qld Arab Tale

The jackal half-ran, half-
limped across the Arabian

desert in the setting sun, ex-
hausted from the afternoon
chase. The nomadic hunters re-
lentlessly pursued, increasing
his terror with every bound.
In the solitary tent ahead lay
his only chance for survival.
Wearily he stooped and crept
in. only to be confronted by the
startled tentsman. “I seek
refuge for the night from the
hunters who follow.” “You
have protection and my bond,”
the Arab responded. and the
jackal slunk to the deepest re-
cesses of the shelter.

The hunters approached in
boisterous fashion, incensed
with the coming conquest. Hav-
ing seen their prey enter the
tent they stepped boldly in and
demanded him of the keeper.
“He's not yours to have,” the
tentsman softly and firmly re-
plied. The thirsty hunters with-
drew after vain argument to
a nearby encampment, there to
await the capture and kill.

BOY YOURE
REALLY GETTING
FAT!

By DAVID ROBINSON

The cool breezes of the night
indeed did bring death — but
death to the «wnsuspecting,
sleeping tentsman at the hands
and teeth of the ungrateful
jackal, unconscious of the high-
er principles of his benefactor.

A steady stream of refugees
flow from east to west in Con-
tinental Europe, men and wo-
men who have suffered for
their Christian faith at the
hands of communist regimes
and who have only out of
necessity left their homelands
and families.

They are welcomed and
warmly enfolded by the mem-
bers of the Church west of
the Iron Curtein. Their bene-
factors hold the strange be-
lief that the suffering church
is the only real Church and
thet only as they, the ma-
terially blessed, sacrifice to
receive their refugee
brethren do they partake of
the nature of this real
Church.

The first account is a popu-
lar Arab legend; to our Ameri-
can ears it sounds at least un-
natural, unreal, and  uncon-
temporary, and perhaps fright-
ening. It is told with intense
fervor and spirit by the Arab,
as representative of the fidelity
of his people. It is believed by
him and is true in the most real
sense of belief and truth, for
he practices it. It may be in-
comprehensible to us precisely
because it speaks uf the future
and we of the present and past,
because it speaks of a more en-
during quality and our culture
of a less permanent quality.

The second passage is a reali-
ty of much of the experience of
the Christian Church of West-
ern Europe. The tone of that
experience, of a redemptively
acting community, is often for-
eign to our ears as well.

. We may at least gather that
the decline of America would
mean neither the loss of moral
values and meanings in the
world nor the end of the life
of the Christian Church.

Some Jottings On
The Campus Scene is

By JOHN TOUMARAS

There’s something special about Mid-Winters. True,
the world lies dormant and bare in the clutch of winter,
and there’s neither the crisp air of Homecoming nor
the cool, green grass of Spring Frolics, but at Mid-Winters
one begins to become aware of the coming of Spring
with all her ‘atcendent emotions.

Some think of this as an “off” dance weekend. Is
there anything “off” about a young man and woman
spending a few, short days together enjoying one an-
others company and the company of other young cou-
ples? Is there anything “off” in taking time to seek the
intangible wonders of life? Mid-Winters may be a week-
end like all other weekends, but still there’s something
special about it.

Many thanks to the Planning and Building Commis-
sion uf the College for the lights on the fraternity
court. Now that the parking spaces are lighted, one
will be able to see the mud that he will have to walk
through to get to the street. But vould it be possible
to place a light at the steps and path so one will not
break his neck or trip over a tricycle or hula hoop?

Last week a notice was placed on all the official
and unofficial bulletin boards stating that Vespers next
week is to be held in Chambers Auditorium. That was
all. Now, gentlemen, are we to sit in our assigned seats
or be given a white card and allowed to sit wherever
and with whomever we please?

Is it really going to be a Vespers services or is
it going to be a candlelight chapel service without the
bell to tell the speaker when to stop? Why not just
do away with Vespers altogether?

New Student Council
Must Assume Duties -

By TOM COLVIN

As we are nearing the period
of transition into the Student
Council-Fonor Council system
of student government, perhaps
‘ve should pause to. examine
one of. the biggest problems
which has faced our student
government in the past and the
extent to which this new sys-
tem will answer this problem.

INHERENT FAILURE

This failing, inherent in our
student government setup of
the past, has been its lack of
identity with the student body
and the subsequent lack of in-
terest on the part of the stu-
dents. } The student feels no
dent government and looks on
it with only passive interest.
Is this as it should be? The
logical answer is of course,
“No.”

What has the Student Coun-
cil lacked in the past which
has kept it from arousing stu-
dent interest? First, the very
nsture of our governmental or-
ganization bars interested stu-
dents from participating in the
functioning of the student gov-
ernment unless he is one of the
few elected to such a job. For
one to be truly interested in
an organization, one must be
able to take an active part in
the activities of the organiza-
tion. Second, the Student Coun-
cil is devoid of enthusiasm.
The duties of the Council are
very stereotyped and soon be-
come dull and monotonous.
These two faults make the Stu-
dent Council a very drab and
uninteresting organiz ation,
quite incapable of arousing any
active interest. It is only by an
occasional _ legislative issue
which stirs some limited con-
troversy that the organization
is saved from being complete-
ly dead.

NEW FREEDOM

If these are the problems,
how will the new setup succeed
in meeting them? In the past
the judicial duties of the Coun-
cil have generally accounted
for the bulk of its labors. Be-

By Schulz

cause. of. the tme iimitations
which these duties imposed, the
possibility of developing pro-
grams which would build stu-
dent interest in its activities
were immediately excluded.
The Honor Court will assume
these time-consuming judicial.
duties. This new governmental
plan will bestow on the Coun-
cil a freedom which it has nev-
er known.

Now that the Student Coun-
cil has obtained this new-found
freedom, perhaps we would do
well to re-examine its purposes
At present the purpose of the
Student Council is conceived of
as being purely legislative.
However, shouldn't it be more
than that? There are many
other duties of campus-wide
significance which should
logically be assumed by the
Student Council. The Student
Council might well take over
some of the present duties of
the YMCA, the campus service
club. Indeed, the purpose of
the “Y” should actually be con-
cerned with religion rather
than simply service. (Perhaps,
this confusion of purpose can
account for some of the diffi-
culty which the “Y” is present-
ly encountering in establishing
an effective program.) For
example, the Student Council
should quite logically take ov-

er the publication of the Wild- |

cat Handbook. The Council
might also establish a Lecture
Series Committee, which would
be a final development of the
independent Great Issues Com-
mittee.

NEW COMMITTEES

In order to attend to such
new duties, standing commit-
tees would be established, the
membership being composed of
a chairman from the Council
and a number of interested stu-
dents from within the student
body. This new plan would al-
low students to take active part
in their student government
and would enable the Council
to maintain an energetic and
interesting program.

The effect of such a govern-
mental reorganization would be
to increase student interest in
the student government as
more students would be active-
ly involved in its activities. Al-
so the real potentialities of the
student government organiza-
tion would be fulfilled, and the

‘

YMCA might be rejuvenated by ,

its realization of its true pur-
pose,
