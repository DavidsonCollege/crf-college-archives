Prostitute Resigns Amidst Charges of Decency

The seamy underbelly of New
York’s nightlife was shocked to
learn that Cherry “Don’t” Spitza,
Soho call-girl of notoriously ill-
repute, who had devoted her entire
professional career to being bawdy,
trampy, slutty, and generally
unprofessional, has resigned
amidst charges of decency, sources

| Say.

In an affadavit released Monday,
a pimp at Soho’s
famous Emperor’s Club, charged
Cherry with taking night-school
classes, sobering up, consistently
dating the same person, and buying
a grey flannel suit at Ann Taylor.

Cherry, a self-termed cathouse
“lifer” had seemingly devoted her
entire career to scandal, promiscu-
ity, and intrigue. She began her
work in a cramped Vietnamese pri-
vate practice in the East Village,
where she remained until 1987,
when she moved uptown to West
55th Street’s legendary fellatio
emporium, Chacha’s.

After a four-year stint in this
famous pleasure dome, she moved
to the west coast, working in
increasingly more elaborate dens

Once considered a paragon of infi-
delity, Cherry has shocked the
media with her private propriety.

of vice. From 1993 to 1996 she
lived in the John F. Kennedy suite
of the Playboy Mansion, and in
1998 she posed for the centerfold
of Hustler magazine. In 2000 she
fronted nearly $300,000, much of it
her own money, in a failed attempt
to start her own pornagraphic mag-

Juniors Win Housing Lottery, Will Move from
Derelict Jarvis Court to Plush Martin Court

The four winners of the housing lottery were finally able to move from

Jarvis Court to the more opulent, adjacent neighborhood, Martin Court.

The Davidson College Power
Ball Housing Lottery jackpot had
risen to one full Martin Court
Senior Apartment, with a cash

value of untold thousands. The
odds, according to Housing
Coordinator and Lottery

Spokeswoman Shirley Taters, were
roughly one in five million.

That didn’t stop juniors Trish
Goodheart, Candy Applegate,
Sandy Smith, and Misty Mason
from buying their weekly scratch
ticket from the school bookstore.

“When I saw we won, I was like
oh my God, girls, we’re moving
out of this trash heap.”

The four girls had been living
below the poverty line since 2006
construction on Duke Dormitory
had forced them out of their dorm
rooms and into the tentatively

named Jarvis Court, a makeshift
assortment of trailors and recre-
ational vehicles looming behind
the Baker Sports Complex Parking
Lot. The girls have been living in
an uncle’s 1983 Ford Four Winds
Majestic C RV.

There are still some 46 students,
almost all of them frequent lottery
players, living in Jarvis Court,
along with a caravan of gypsies
camped at the entrance to the cross
country trails.

When asked for comment, Misty
said, “We’re just so lucky God sent
us this. My mom and my grandma
are prolly gunna have to move in
with us. But it?ll work out fine. I
Just hope the water and the heat are
still working after the government
takes away money for taxes and
all.”

Pimp Ray Palconi can't believe his
best call girl is a Daughter of the
American Revolution.

azine. The new millenium brought
renewed success at the decadent,
imperious Emperor’s Club, a bor-
dello unparalelled in the realm of
seedy gandeur.

There she quickly rose from the
lower rungs of Ghenghis Khan
Concubine and Mogul Mistress to

Versailles Vixen and finally to the
peerless position of Cleopatra.

The allegations of her propriety
turned off many clients, col-
leagues, and booking agents to the
extent that had she not resigned,
she would have faced almost cer-
tain impeachment. Withdrawing
from contact with fellow floozies,
Cherry spent three days in her mid-
town apartment, deliberating her
options with her boyfriend, who
she has allegedly been seeing for a
shocking three weeks.

Dave, the boyfriend, who had
always had reservations about her
line of work, bizarrely urged her to
stay on, call girls close to the cou-
ple say.

Her pimp, Palconi, commented:
“It’s just so ironic. For years she
lives a nice, shameful way life, and
now she’s acting like she’s on a
friggin episode of Avonlea.”

But Cherry, who has swallowed
much criticism in the past, is
almost certain to resign, saying that
right now she needs to devote her
attention to re-reading the Kama
Sutra, rechanelling her impropri-
ety, and sleeping around a little.

Unathletic Date Ejected from Players’ Ball

Slightly paunchy, often-winded,
truffle-loving Besty Roberts should
have known her company was not
desired among the throngs of chis-
elled, tapered, immaculately coor-
dinated, lushly tanned, tantilizingly
gyrating Division-I bodies that
made up the dance floor of the first
annual athlete’s formal, The
Players’ Ball.

“T didn’t know that dates had to
be athletic too,” said Betsy, who
has never cracked 9:00 for the met-
ric mile and admittedly has trouble
doing more than 15 consecutive
sit-ups.

The Risk Managers for the party,
Davidson Trainers Ray Beltz and
Gerry Waddle, noticed something
was up when they saw a flushed
Betsy panting heavily on the dance
floor only three minutes into
“Thriller.”

Confronting her, the asked if
she’d had too much to drink, or
perhaps not enough Gatorade.
Further questioning confirmed a

Zebra cakes. He put her on a tread-
mill until the first shuttle ran back
to campus at I1:15p.m.

“This is a players’ ball,’ Ray
said, “and that girl clearly should
have remained a spectator.”

Other ejections included Fly the
Falcon Falconi, who fouled out
midway through the second half.

Home run hero’ Graham
Chapman, tested positive for a

low-grade beaver traquilizer short-
ly before last call, while 800m stud
Brad Troxell was dragged from the
party kicking and screaming that
he had never indulged in blood
doping.

The following day the school
released the Ross Report, which
stipulated that in the future, players
should must fit, clean, previous let-
ter-winners who have never. been
convicted of substance abuse.

This honey bun never should’ve
made it onto the court.

Fortunately there were no cork
bat, ephenedrine, point-shaving, or
offical-bribing scandals.

Amidst so much scandal, howev-
er, administrators have advocated
boycotting the next Players’ Ball.

On a side note, Scott Myers
finally completed his water credit
when he fell into the quarry at
1:20a.m.
