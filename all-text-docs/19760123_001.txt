College stops hall counselor’s pay

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Editor

The college policy of paying Fresh-
man Hall Counselors $100 a term has
been discontinued. The money will
now be used to finance “‘other student
services” including the Experiential
Learning Programs.

The decision to discontinue pay-
ment of Hall Counselors came during
the time that the Dean of Student’s
office was recieving applications for
next year’s counseling positions.
Those who have applied did so as-
suming they would be paid.

“The decision had not been made
when applications began,”’ said Dean

of Students Will H. Terry, ‘‘but I
doubt that anyone applied because of
the money. Hall counseling is a
service job and a student could make
more money working somewhere
else,’’ he said.

“I don’t think anybody had gone
into the job for the money. The

stipend they recieve was just thought ~

of as whip cream on top,” said Terry.

The decision stems at least in part
to the discovery by college President
Samuel R.-Spencer Jr. that hall
counselors or ‘Junior Advisors’ at
Williams College were not being paid.

“They pay hall counselors almost
everywhere else and I must confess
that when I started the program here

I figured we had to pay just like
everyone else did,’’ said Spencer.

“Then I found out that Williams
College which is very much like
Davidson in every way did not pay its
junior advisors. I said, ‘by golly if
they can do it, why can’t we?’ ”’

In the past the money given to Hall
Counselors has provided them with an
opportunity to spend some money on
hall activities without clearing the
expense with the Dean’s office first.

“Next year’s Freshman Advisors
Carol Connor and Gary Barnes told
me that some of the money was spent
for hall activities, and I didn’t know
that. They said that they didn’t mind
spending a little of their own money

because they knew that they were
getting paid,”’ said Terry.

“‘Whenever a hall counselor spends
money for his hall, he will still
certainly be reimbursed,’’ he added.

«The decision to discontinue pay-
ment is designed, according to Spen-
cer, to underscore the importance of
volunteer service.

“We do the students a disservice if
we promote the idea that students
should be paid for the things they
do,’’ said Spencer. ‘‘One of the main
problems in our society is the mater-
ialism that enters into everything we
do,’’ he added.

Terry agrees with Spencer that hall
counseling is a service job and
suggests that. Davidson students
need to be prepared to do service jobs
throughout their lives without pay-
ment.

‘‘Most Davidson people will be
called upon to do many things in the
community sheerly from the motive of .
concern for other people. These jobs

Jackson predicts cessation

The 1976 showing of the
Davidson National print ex-
hibit may be the’last. Assoc-
iate Professor of Art Herbert
Jackson has indicated that he
cannot continue to mount the
show without a full-time as-
sistant.

Jackson submitted a writ-
ten request for an additional
faculty member for the art
department and a re-evalua-

1975. The request was tabled
due to lack of funds.

The college administration
is presently hoping to convert
Chambers Banquet Hall into
an art gallery, a project which
would, Jackson estimated,
cost around $25,000. This and
the expiration of the grant
funding the Experiential Lear-
ning Program have precluded
allocation of funds to the art
department.

Spencer also indicated that
he was not willing to involve
the college in a long-term
commitment to support the
National. ‘‘I still hope some-
thing might be worked out,”
he said, adding that he was
“open to any suggestions.”

Jackson was not disap-
pointed to hear of Spencer’s
decision. ‘‘It’s time for it to be
over for me,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s too
much in addition to teaching
and painting.”’

The National is known
across the United States and
was the first exhibition of its
kind in the United States. It
draws some 2500 entries each
year, each of which Jackson
catalogues, with student as-

Snow wins ’77 senate seat
with second class election

By STEPHEN BELL
Senior News Editor
Tuesday afternoon, new el-

. ections for SGA Senate rep-

resentatives for the class of
1977 were held,
In the new elections, Tony

** Snow, Lynne Keener. and

Joe Logan won seats on the
Senate for the class of ’77, and
were sworn into office at the
Senate meeting that evening.
A similar situation with the
class of ’78, involving ques-
tions of which students had a
right to appear on the election
ballot, was resolved without

, the need for a second election.

Steve Sparger withdrew his
appeal to have his name
appear on the ballot, and thus
the results of the first election
were allowed to stand.

D.C. Augustine, Steve
Smith, and David Tinkler had

won in the January 13 elec-
tion, and they, too, were
sworn into office at the Senate
meeting last Tuesday night.

Peyton Marshall, parlia-
mentarian of the Senate, said,
“After the mistakes that were
made before the first election,
any outcome would have been
at odds with one or another of
the SGA By-laws. But I think
this outcome, in terms of the
ethical thrust of the by-laws,
was optimal.”

. Marshall explained that, to
avoid these situations in the
future, the by-laws are being
revised to establish an adjud-
icating body to settle constitu-
tional questions, and to spe-
cify an election appeals pro-
cedure for students. The sign-
up process, the source of the
problems with the January
13 elections, is also being

modified.
Baskin commented, ‘“Con-
sidering the mistakes made in

the beginning, I think things
went as well as they could
have. I’m sorry Sabra Faires
was put in the position she
was in. But all this is behind

‘us now. I think weve got a

good Senate,’

Faires had won a Senate
seat in the first, invalidated
election, but she lost it to
Snow in the second election.

A number of other offices
were filled Tuesday night. Joe
Hartsoe was appointed to.
replace newly-elected SGA
vice-president Steve Cuffe as
Belk Dorm senator, Bo Hun-
ter was appointed to chair the
Parking and Security Com-
mittee, and Patti Phillips was
appointed to chair the Build-
ing and Grounds Committee.
