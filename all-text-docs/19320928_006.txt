before his Maker never to drink again. A
few hours afterward he tore the tiny shoes
from the corpse and went’ out to buy liquor
with-what money he could get for them.
But finally the rebirth came to him, and he
was able to resist the power which had over-
come the strength of his body and mind with
-the power that came from heaven. The re-
generation of the spirit leads to a spiritual
life.

In the third place, a man is not fit for
spiritual things without a second birth. Sin
ruins us, but God can cleanse us. David
cried out, realizing his trespasses: “Purge
me, O Lord, with hyssop.” There was once
a man who dreamed he went to heaven.
Arriving in all its splendor, he saw that_a
brilliant light made every soul transparent.
And then he saw that many were
turned upon him. He looked down, and
there, around his heart, was a black blot of
sin. This man had never been born again
on ‘earth; heaven was hell to him.

In the fourth place, a man has no right
to a real life of the spirit until he has been
born again. In the beginning, God made
man in His own image, but sin marred the
image, and ever since man has-been born
in sin.’ Then Christ purchased a new right
for man. Faith, acceptance, appropriation

eyes

of Christ gives a man the right to a new
birth. A great example of a rebirth is the |
story of Uncle Jaggers. Uncle Jaggers was|
born a slave, He was an exceedingly old|
negro; none of the students at the Seminary,
to whom he was very well known, could tell
how old he was. Uncle Jaggers was a great
Christian. He helped the poor and the needy
and the hungry, and he took in the widows
and the orphans, and out of all the money
he ever had left over at the end of the year
he took for himself the sum of one cent.
_-When Uncle Jaggers came to the Seminary
in his old, broken-down gurrey, driving his
old horse, you could never tell, when he got
out, which would fall to pieces first, the
surrey, the horse, or the man. Uncle Jag-|
gers was an enthusiastic student in some of |
the Bible courses at the Seminary, and when |
the lesson under study became particularly
inspiring, a fervent “Amen, Amen” was heard
from Uncle Jaggers’ seat. At a great age
Uncle. Jaggers died. The State Legislature
adjourned, the Governor came, whité pall-
bearers bore the coffin, white ministers held
the service, for all who had known him sor-
rowed for Uncle Jagers, because, while it
was true that Uncle Jaggers had been born
a black slave, he did not die a slave, for he
had been reborn a Christian.
The service was closed with the benedic:
tion by Dr. Moffett.

attention, In the same publication there are
four other articles by the Davidson French

_ professor.

The Modern Language Journal, official or-
gan of the National Federation of Modern
Language Teachers, has recently published
several critical articles by Dr. Watts, in
which he has reviewed the works of prom-
inent French authors. The most recent is
his discussion of the new edition of Racine’s
works, “Theatre Choisi,” Paris, 1931. Worthy
of note have also been articles on the work
of Jean dela Brete’s “Aimer Quand Meme,”
and Alain Fournier’s “Le Grand Meaulnes,”
from the pen of this gifted reviewer and

is a bit of the history of the Hapless Haps-
burgs. Miss Claire did some unusually good
acting and kept it from being a boring occa-
sion. Her every movement was graceful and
the high light of the performance was her
acting at the famous breakfast scene. No
matter how trifling the situation, when she
faced the ‘audience it was with her chin up
and her head thrown back. San Francisco
has many “legitimate” houses where the
year’s New York successes appear through-
out the cool summer.

Under the able leadership of Captain
Cathey and Alternate Captain Windham, the
Wildkittens have proven themselves’ to be
a smooth-working and hard-fighting team,
and a team worthy of representing Davidson.

E buy the finest, the very

They are mot present in Luckies
. .. the mildest cigarette
you ever smoked.

these fine tobaccos, after
proper aging and mellowing,
are then given the benefit of
that Lucky Strike purifying
process, described by the
words—“‘It’s toasted”’. That’s
why folks in every city, town
and hamlet say that Luckies
are such mild cigarettes.

“It’s toasted”

“Ifa man write a better book, preach a better sermon, or make a better mouse-trap than his neighbor, tho he
build bis house in the woods, the world will make a beatin path to bis door.”’—RALPH WALDO EMERSON.
Does not this explain the world-wide! acceptance and approval of Lucky Strike?
