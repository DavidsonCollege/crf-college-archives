that he was worki h the Duke

his job fine. Asked whether he
would ever return to Davidson he
replied “no chance.”

Ivan Mothershead, leading
distance runner in the South-

about Virginia Tech’s track

team this-year, replied.-‘that it

“Guess I was lucky that day.”

added that it would help Dav-

the regulations will have to be
altered.

Shows Skill in Display
Of Daring Acts

Davidson’s corps of gymnas-
tics extragrdinary gave their
second ex xMibition of flying skill
since the holidays during the
half of the Wake Forest-Day-
idson basketball game last Sat-
urday night.

With machine-like precision, ten
white-clad figures performed weird
leaps and bounds which gave proof
of the perfect balance possessed by
these performers. Before the crowd
had finished applauding one act the
next was in the process of unfold-
ing.

Last Saturday
composed the following
Jack B. Green,
Harris, J. W. Hickman,
Holt, Pete Mcknight,
Smith, Don Stewart, John
ton and Gene Vogler.

The whole exhibition less
than ten minutes but those ten
were packed with demonstrations of
balance and skill and co-ordination.
It was greatly enjoyed by the au-
dience. The team is under the lead-
ership of Pete Whittle and Gordon
Smith, last year’s gymnastic cham-
pion.
