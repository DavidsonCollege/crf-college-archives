Faculty Takes Part
In N.C.E.A. Meeting

Three. Davidson Professors Are
Prominent in Convention

Dr. T. W. Lingle, Dr. P. H. Gwynn,
and Dr. W. P. Cumming of the David-
son faculty attended the recent meet-
ing of the North Carolina Educational
Association and played prominent parts
in its activities. The association met
March 23rd and 24th at Raleigh.

Dr. Lingle attended the meeting of
the council for higher education as a
member of a committee meeting there.
Dr. Gwynn presided over the council
for higher education at which Julian
Miller, columnist for the Charlotte Ob-
server, was a principal speaker.

Professor Cumming, a member of the
English Department at Davidson, ad-
dressed the council of English teachers
on the subject, “Character Building
Through the Teaching of English Lit-
erature.” He pointed out several meth-
ods by which literature could be used
to enable the students to see the mean-
ing and the values of life.

He suggested that the student
through the reading of biography’ and
through a discussion of situations found
therein might be aided in forming a
truer conception of moral and social
values. Emphasizing the importance
of a stimulating, clear, organized
thought through composition, he illus-
trated the lack of clear thinking on
moral and social problems in college
and public life.

Cumming pointed out several ways
in which the professor might equip
himself for character training in the
student and emphasized the value of
intellectual hunger in the teacher as a
stimulus for the student.

The three faculty members returned
from their activities in Raleigh Satur-
day night after the committee meet-
ing had formally adjourned.

Davidson Debaters
End Eastern Tour

Davidson Team Debates W. & L.,
Rutgers, and Bucknell

The Davidson debating team, repre-
sented by E, J. Humphrey and J. H.
Fitzgerald, won one debate, lost one
and tied one on their eastern tour.

Leaving here March 14th, the team
traveled to Lexington, Va., to debate
Washington and Lee that night. The
decision rendered by the judges was
given to W. & L., but the audience de-
cision went to Davidson. Leaving Lex-
ington Thursday morning, the debaters
went to New Brunswick, N. J., where
they met Rutgers University. The de-
cision of one judge lost the debate for
the home team. .

On Friday the team went to Bucknell
at Lewisburg, Pa., where a debate,
which was scheduled not to be judged,
was held before a political science
class ond on ‘a class vote the decision
went to Davidson. The team returned
to Davidson on Saturday.

The negative side of the question,
“The President of the United States
Should Have His Powers Substantially
Increased,” was upheld by the David-
son team in all three debates.

The debating season as a_ whole,
stated Humphrey, was very good. A
majority of the debates were non-de-
cision debates, but of the decision de-
bates the University of South Caro-
lina, University of Kentucky, and
Bucknell, all of whom were rated as

Deputation From
Seminary Speaks
At Services Here

Group Present Consisted of Joe
Clower, “Jas. A.” Jones and
Fred V. Poag

MAKES ANNUAL VISIT

Three Students Speak at Various
Religious Services

Last week-end the Union Theological
Seminary sent a deputation to David-
son consisting of three men, Joe Clow-
er, J. A. Jones, and Fred V. Poag.
Jones graduated from Davidson in
1931, and Poag in 1930.

Poag spoke at the regular church
service Sunday morning, March 25, and
Jones at the vesper service that night,
and also in chapel*Monday morning.
Clower preached at the evening church
service.

The vesper service Sunday night was
led by Bob Smith of the Junior -class.
After an organ prelude by Kenneth
Scott and a hymn, the scripture was
read, which consisted of selections
from the Psalms. Another hymn and
a violin duet by W. J. Robinson and
J. H. Ross followed, after which Mack
Holland led the assembly in prayer.

The speaker, better known as “Jas.
A.” Jones, opened his sermon by say-
ing that we are living in a changing
world, Philosophers, preachers, teach-
ers, business men, economists, and psy-
chologists are perplexed with changing
conditions, and are constantly trying to
adjust themselves to new trends of
thought.

The changes are found even in relig-
ion, but there are three fundamental
truths that are essential if our lives
prosper.

Chemistry Students...
See McClaren Plant

Manager of Plant Explains Proc-
esses to Class

soe

On Wednesday, March 21, Professor
H. B. Arbuckle’s chemistry 6 class en-
joyed a visit to the "McClaren Rubber
Company’s plant in Charlotte.

Mr. Miller, manager of the plant,
personally explained to the class the
source of their rubber products, its
preparation in field and factory, and
the final stage in which crude rubber
emerges as a finished automobile tire.

Manager Miller further explained
that the McClaren Company has one
of its finest plants located in Charlotte
and that their principal field of busi-
ness is centered in the Southern and
Central States. Most of their crude
rubber is exported from Brazil. The
plant is well equipped and modern in
every respect, from the giant com-
pressing machines to the ever-burning
mercury vapor lamps that furnish
light for the whole factory.

The Palmer Street factory has for
twenty years stressed the building of
heavy duty truck tires, and today this
factory manufactures some of the fin-
est truck tires in the entire world. It
is estimated that a skilled workman
is able to make a tire in approximately
one hour and fifteen minutes. In sev-
eral departments requiring the use of
chemicals, gas masks are worn by the
workers.

The twelve members of the class
were divided into groups and taken
through the factory by guides who
explained the various processes entailed
in the manufacture of a tire.

Grier Martin’s Father
Dies at Georgia Home

The many friends of Grier Martin,
alumni secretary of Davidson College,
were very sorry to learn of the death
of his father, who died last Thursday
night from injuries received in an au-
tomobile accident. Mr. Martin’s death
was very sudden and came as a shock
to all those who knew, him.

Grier Martin went to his home in
Covington, Ga., immediately upon hear-
ing of his father’s accident, the cause
of which is unknown at the present
time.

The Davidson friends of Grier Mar-
tin joined him with deep sympathy in
his time of bereavement. The time
of Grier Martin’s return to Davidson is

indefinite.

Dr. Hood Will Speak

At Decatur Georgia

Psychology Professor Will De-
liver Smyth Lectures

Dr. Frazer “Hood, head of the Psy-
chology Department at Davidson, will
on April 9 begin a series of lectures
at Columbia Theological Seminary in
Decatur, Ga., known as the “Smyth
Lectures.”

The chief subject of the lectures will
be “The Challenge of Faith,” with the
sub-title being “The Psychologist's
Viewpoint.” Dr. Hood will speak for
six successive days, beginning on April
9 and closing on April 14.

These lectures are a _ foundation
somewhat similar to the Otts Founda-
tion here at Davidson. Heretofore a
clergyman has been invited to speak,
this being the first time a layman has
ever been asked to conduct the lec-
tures. This change was brought about
by Dr. W. T. Thompson, of Richmond,
who decided last year that it would
be well tg have a layman discuss the
meaning and functions of the religious
life.

While visiting in Decatur Dr. Hood
will be the guest of President McDow-
ell Richards, an alumnus of Davidson
College.

The. invitation to deliver these lec-
tures is an honor not only to Dr. Hood
but also to the college.

Delta Pi Kappa Elects
Leaders for New Year

Delta Pi Kappa, honorary journal-
istic fraternity, held its regular meet-
ing on last Wednesday evening at 7:00
o'clock. At this meeting, officers for
the coming year were elected. Those
chosen to lead the local fraternity next
year were: K. D. Weeks, president;
Jack Hellinger, vice-president, and
George Gullette, secretary and treas-
urer.

At the next meeting, the society will
extend invitations to new men who
have been outstanding in journalistic
activities here on the campus. One
member of the Freshman class who
has been especially efficient on the
Davidsonian staff this year will be in-
vited to become an honorary member
and will be formally taken in during

his sophomore year.

Heads Y.M.C.A.

Walter Sprunt, of Wilmington,
has been chosen to lead the Y. M.
C. A. work at Davidson for the
ensuing year. He won the election
over Bob Coit on the third ballot.

Exhibit of German
Art Is Given Here

Most Popular Picture Will Be
Given to College

The exhibit of German art, brought
to Davidson College under the auspices
of the Carl Schurz Memorial Founda-
tion, which has been on display during
the past week, closed today. The pic-
ture which received the most votes
during this time will be presented to
the college this summer, it was an-
nounced.

During the week-end, this exhibit
was taken for the second time to Ra-
leigh at the request of the State De-
partment of Education. The reason for
this was the three-day teachers’ con-
vention held there.

The collection was displayed for two
days at the Carolina Hotel and at the
| Hugh... Morson... High —Schooly..where|
most of the meetings took place. It
served as the basis of ‘an illustrative
lecture, given by Mrs. Johnsen princi-
pally to the art teachers, on German
Art and Etchings. These works of
art had formerly been shown in Ra-
leigh for two weeks during January.

The purpose of the exhibit is to en-
courage-appreciation of art among stu-
dents and to stimulate interest in Ger-
man culture. While it is taken to the
majority of the big universities, it is
also shown at many smaller places
where people have no opportunity to
see and appreciate German art.

After leaving Davidson, the art col-
lection will be shown in Charlotte for
two weeks under the auspices of the
Woman's Club. It will also be taken to
colleges in South Carolina, probably
going as far south as Charleston by
the end of the school year,

The modern wing of the exhibit is
all original, containing the works of
the most important illustrators, paint-
ers, and sculptors, aS well as special-
ists, in the graphic arts. Many of these
are the first impressions of a plate and
are consequently very rare.

The lead cuts by Otto Nueckel are

Davidson Teams Will
Make Vacation Trips

Interesting Holidays Planned by
Other Students

Now that the greatly anticipated
Easter holidays are almost here, it is
interesting to note just how and where
members of the student body intend to
spend them.

The tennis team will take it
themselves to travel to the “Land of

upon

Flowers,” and will encounter six teams
during their vacation period. The first
part of their program calls for a trip
to Savannah, Ga., where they will
spend one night. Then Thursday after-
noon at Gainesville they will encounter
the University of Florida tennis team
in the first match of the season. Sat-
urday the team will meet Rollins Col-
lege at Winter Park, Fla., and then
will begin the return trip north, meet-
ing Emory and Georgia Tech at At-
lanta, ‘Fiirman at Greenville, S. C., and
finally the University of South Caro-
lina at Columbia.

The baseball team will enjoy a trip,
too, although’a very short one as com-
pared to that of the net team. ‘They
are scheduled to meet Carolina in two
games, one at Gastonia Saturday, and
the other at Concord Monday. How-
ever, during the rest of the vacation
period the team will return and con-
tinue practice on Richardson Field.

Several members of the student body
have announced their intentions of
making a trip to New York. They are
planning to leave Thursday by auto-
mobile and return to the campus
Wednesday morning.

There are still other men who be-
lieve that a better time can be had by
remaining upon the campus. However,
as usually is the case, some irresistable
force attracts them to Charlotte,
Greensboro, or other points, where they
can enjoy the company of their girl
friends.
