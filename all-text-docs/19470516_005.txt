Phi Mu Gives Exhibit
Otficers .

New

On May 14th, 15th and 16th, Phi’
Mu Alpha sponsored an art exhibit
as the last of the fraternity’s proj-
ects for this year. This exhibit has
been made possible through the co-
operation of the Mint Museum of
Art of Charlotte, N. C., and its di-
rector Mr. Hutchison, who has made
the Museum’s loan exhibit available.
In addition to the loan exhibit, ad-
ditional works by local townspeople
will be featured, bringing the total
number of painters to apprbxi-
mately twenty.

This project was handled for Phi
Mu Alpha by an exhibit committee
of which B. L. Watkins, Jr., was
chairman, The committee endeavor-
ed to have paintings which repre-
sented various styles and schools
of art’ in the exhibit, which were
undertaken to stimulate interest in
the Fine Arts on the campus.
