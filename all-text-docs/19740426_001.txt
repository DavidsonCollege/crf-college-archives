College Property Sale

By TODD EADES
Associate Editor
Opposition is mounting to
college consideration to sell
300 acres of land in Burke
County, N.C. The land, near
Glen Alpine and adjacent to
the South Mountain Game
Management Area, is used by
the biology department to
collect material for research
and for class field trips. The
property is approximately 30
miles from Davidson.

An offer of $300 an acre has
been made to the college by an
unknown party, possibly an
owner of adjoining propeny
through the Southern
Estate Agency of Charketie,
Sale of the property would net
the college $80,000-$90,000,
depending upon the amount of
commission paid the realtor.
The money would go into the
endowment. S. M. Goodman
deeded the land to the college
endowment in October, 1948.

Since that time the land has
produced little income. In the
early 1960's ‘the college sold
timber and gravel from 200
acres of the land. Real estate
taxes for 1973 were $152. There
are no improvements on the
land.

Wednesday, an interested

group, including Professor of
Biology Tom Daggy,
Professor of French Hallam
Walker, Senior Tom Hatley,
and five other students met
with college Business
Manager Robert Currie to
learn the status of the issue
and to discuss the prospective
sale.

Currie explained that gifts
to the endowment are
assumed to be made for the
production of income. Mem-
bers of the group stressed the
educational, ecological, and
potential recreational benefits
of the land.

Currie will relay these
arguments to a meeting of
himself, college President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr., and
Vice President of Finance and
Development C. David Cor-
nell, from which a recom-
mendation will be made to the
Trustee Finance Committee.
A decision is expected next
week.

The biology department
became interested in the Glen
Alpine land about 12 years
ago, using it for an occasional
field trip. Use of the land has
increased since.

This year, two classes in the
fall term and two classes in
the spring term have made

Minimum Wage Hike To Affect ARA

By BRUCE CORSER
Managing Editor

President Nixon, on April 8, signed in-
to law a measure raising the Federal

minimum wage in gradual s to $2.30
an hour. The minimum now eat, 60.

College employees will be unaffected
by the new legislation but the ARA
branch at Davidson will have to comply
with new wage scales.

Initial raises will take effect a 1,
with further increases effective on
January 1 of succeeding years. The rate
goes to $1.90 May 1, then $2.00, $2.20,
and $2.30 by Jan. 1, 1977.

The law permits higher education in-
stitutions to employ ‘their full-time
students at 85 percent of the applicable
minimum wage. However, Davidson
will not be forced to boost work-study
wages until 1976 since the college
already pays them $1.80 an hour.

The starting rate for full-time
custodians is $2.20 an hour. This rate
compares with $.98 an hour wage for
the 1963-64 period. Full time laundry
employees now receive $2.00 an hour as
compared with $.92 an hour a decade
ago.

College Business Manager Robert
Currie has received figures from ARA

Director Ron Scott which indicate that
there will be an adjustment in the cost
of meal tickets next year. These
figures, still unavailable, have yet to be
approved by the Trustees.

However, the catalogue indicates
that there is the possibility of change in
the board fee from the stated figure.

Over the past year, the total cost for
meal tickets at ARA has been $675.
Currie said, ‘‘I feel sure that there is
going to be an adjustment in the board
figure next year. The basic reason for
this increase is the amendment to the
minimum wage law."

College Laundry Manager Francis
Beaver stated that the wage bill would
not affect the laundry , since em-
ployees already receive above the
minimum. However, the laundry will
be affected in two years, as a result of
the graduated increase stipulation of
the wage bill.

Scott revealed that the total increase
in the cost of labor for ARA Slater next
year will be $21,500. This figure in-
cludes an increase in wages of work-
study students at A

Scott said that by May 1, 1975 all his
employees will receive $1.90 an hour.

The starting rate for unskilled help at
ARA is now $1.65 an hour.

Currie noted that all college workers
could be affected indirectly by the wage
bill. ‘‘The college has always had to
compete with local industry for help
and so the wage boost could con-
ceivably alter the college wage scale on
a competitive basis."’

about two trips each to the
property. The Edible Wild
Plants class field trip several
weeks ago resulted in a story
in the Charlotte Observer.

Daggy, whose classes use
the land, is the center of op-
position to the sale. ‘‘Glen
Alpine is the only college land
useful for biological pur-
poses,’’ he explained.

The 200 acres from which
the gravel was removed is
now vegetated again, and sup-
ports plant and animal life
which can’t be found in the un-
touched remaining 100 acres.
For biological use, Daggy
said, the mined 200 acres was
“useful but degraded,’’
although the area will never
be a natural mountain valley
again.

‘Daggy has educational and
ecological interests in keeping
and preserving the Glen
Alpine property.

“If the college saved the 300
acres we'd have invaluable
areas for classwork,”’ he said,
and also, ‘I consider it the
duty of a university or college
to buy land in order to preser-
ve it.”

Years ago, Professor of
Biology E. E. Brown (now
retired) attempted to per-
suade the college to purchase
land in the sand hills of
eastern North Carolina, but
without results.

Many other educational in-
stitutions both in the region
and the nation, currently own
land with the intent of preser-
ving its natural state.

Daggy is also disgruntled
with the college’s land
management policies. ‘The
college seems to manage their
land only for money,” he said,
“and not for educational in-
vestments.”

Recently, the college was
going to cut trees on the hill
south of Erwin Lodge. Daggy
saw the trees which were
already marked for logging
and. convinced the college to
halt.

‘The area north of the
playing fields has
been thinned by cutting, which
caused, Daggy explained, the
area to be taken over by
Japanese honeysuckle,

destroying the natural growth
for about 30 years.

“There are a great many
things you can’t figure in
doilars,’’ Daggy maintained.
