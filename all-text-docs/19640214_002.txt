Curriculum, Candidates, Cockroaches

We were highly pleased to hear
Dean Johnston's comments in “Open
End” concerning the inadequacy of
the present overall curriculum frame-
work, which was set up in 1939, a
fantastic twenty-five years ago.

As the Dean explained. that frame-
work classifies the curriculum into

Also of

«print. The

three unnatural divisions, Natural that such
Sciences, Social Sciences, and Lan-
guages, whereas most liberal arts

schools use the classifications Natur-
al Sciences. Social Sciences,

manities.

Dean Johnston also pointed to the
obvious need for an increased inde-

pendent study program.

We do not fee! that either problem
is insurmountable. We therefore look
forward to seeing the faculty and ad-
ministration act in the near future to
remedy both inadequacies cited bv
the Dean. and we can think of no more
fitting place for such action to origin-

ate than the office of the

‘Faculty. who is also chairman. of the
powerful faculty curriculum commit-

tee.

A student observed in the same
“Open End” discussion that Geogra-
phy 51, Meteorology. has been in the
catalog for the four vears he has been
here, and yet has not been taught dur-
ing that time because the Geography
professor does not consider himself
qualified to.teach the subject: °
, Dean Johnston’s rejoinder to the
question as to why the course had
been left in the catalog when it ob-
viously was not being taught was that
he would have been happy to remove
the course from the catalog if the pro-
fessor had only requested same. Such
strikes us as amazingly loose coordina-
tion between faculty and Dean of
Faculty, particularly in a school this

size.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Disgruntled Frosh Independent
Assails Non-Greek Social Life

Dear Editor:

As Greek Week swings into
high gear, increasing numbers
of Freshman Independents make
out applications for transfer. I.
dont presume to speak for any-
one but myself, but there would
seem to be a definite connection
between the two events.

A random check of transfer
figures at Davidson over the
past few years will show an in-
creasing number -of transfers
with the greatest increase in the
Independent group on campus.
Why are they Independents?
Why are they leaving? The first
question is easier to answer
than the second one. Some are
independent by choice, having
rejected bids or else depledged.
while cthers never got a bid,
some not even getting a second
look from the fraternities. Why
are they leaving? It would ap-
pear that Davidson has failed its
Independents.

Some hail Lingle Manor as the
saving grace for the Independ-
ents. Why then do members of
Lingle Manor complain about
the small number of members
and the trouble involved in even
getting those members out to

B.C.

meetings? How can an organiza-
tion purposely set up to avoid
the concept of hand-picked mem
bership that leads to brotherhood
give the brotherhood that its
own constitution denies to it?

T attended an after party of
Lingle Manor at Homecoming.
I have had more fun taking an
exam. Both I and my date were
so embarrassed that we ended
up going to Charlotte before
the party was over in hopes of
finding some life somewhere.
The number of Manor members
there could have been’ counted
on the fingers of two hands.
maybe only one. I know of one
Linglite that was invited to an
upstairs party and put in a
couple of appearances only to
leave, as embarrassed as I was.
People keep saying that Lingle
Manor would be fine if it had
this or if it had that, only to ad-
mit that the makeup of the
Manor denies it in the end,
making those ifs impossible.

Iam not saying that there will
be a mass transfer of Independ-
ents, leaving Davidson 100%
fraternity. Some will stay. Some
find some solace in the face-
saving grace of Lingle Manor.

HOw ARE You?

Some live in this area or know
girls in the area and do not need
any social institution. Some,
maybe, enjoy ‘social exile."
What 1 am trying to say js that
it is high time that some one ot
some people begin to think about
the case of the Independent at
Davidson. Or will the list of
transfers continue growing each
year?
Richard J. Barney
Ed. Note: The above letter
alludes to nonexistent statis-
ties. A check with Bob Young,
assistant dean of students, re-
veals that there are no statis-
tles available that prove that
the number of transfers from
Davidson is increasing. Young
is now making a study of
transfers which will be re-
leased to THE DAVIDSONIAN
when compiled. He said that a
preliminary study indicates
that the number of transfers
Is probably NOT increasing.
Relevant to writer Barney's
contention that non-Greek un-
happiness is accounting for a
greater portion of those trans-
fering being Independents,
Young said it Is possible that
this may be true.

Protest Athiest’s Talk

Ed. Note: The sentiments expressed in the following letters reprinted from the
Charlotte Observer and the Charlotte News indicate that “fox” Dr. Michael Scriven
never knew how many “hens” he was about to disturb when he agreed to present
the atheist’s viewpoint at Davidson. However, our purpose in printing these letters
is not to deride the writers. We hope they will serve to remind our readers of the
illiberal barrage President Martin faces each time controversial speakers present

controversial ideas here.

Wilcox

Dear Editor:

Surely there must be those
among the alumni of Davidson
College who felt a sense of out-
rage and shock when an atheist
appeared, by invitation, on the
college campus. I have looked
and listened, but no voice was
raised in protest or criticism.

I am an elderly woman and a
Presbyterian, so I feel constrain.
ed to voice a protest. for it
seems to me that a question of
long ago is pertinent at this
time: Who is on the Lord's side?

In view of the unfavorable
publicity had by Davidson con-
cerning the effect of religious
(or irreligious) teaching, one
might well ask what is being
taught and, again, what are
those in authority trying to do?
Prove that they are exponents of
‘academic freedom’? Or _ that
they have ‘guts’ as someone so
eloquently expressed it?

Marion C. Wilcox

Smith, Archibald Curry, Cor-
nelia Shaw and Woodrow Wilson
persist in celestial challenge

Or does it take the sages in.
the Davidson Y to give us the
Jatest bulge in the divine right
of ‘‘academic freedom?”

But why Scriven? Why not a
Hume. Gibbon or Voltaire? Why
not. a full blown Bialtmann, un-
expurgated Tillich. a snorting
gray whale, like Nels Ferre, who
eats up a whole sea of the plank-
ton of error? Would this not hon-
or the more giant intellects on
the invitation committee?

Why an amateur popinjay that
most any of us could answer
over the coffee cups, who reads
like the youngest office sweep
from Clarence Darrow’s office?
And from all places, Indiana—
half of whose descendants are of
N.C. descent and notorious for
sound piety and Christian think-
ing?

Wf “the devils believe and
tremble.’ could not Scrivvy, who
seems to qualify on count one,
try the second and tremble just
a little?

Perhaps Mrs. Madalyn Mur-
ray's scheme, to settle the
atheists, comfortably in a colony
out West, might inspire some
people to cease from creating
A-cells, so threatening now in
the East, and ‘“‘go west, young
man, go west!”

But are we looking for re-
form locally? Not so, dear sirs,
not so.

gets bold, and makes his grand
rush, that he whispers, ‘Hush-

Dear Editor:

Someone has said about our
national troubles, ‘It is not the
series of incidents, indicating
failure. but the wrong policy
which created, in the beginning,
the condition of failure.”’

Reflection on this principle
makes me wonder as to the
Scriven episode at Davidson
College.

Never once, as a resident of
metropolitan YMCA's, did I hear
that one should prove deism by
discourses on atheism, or prove

the ultimate of faith, Christ-ism, hush.’ "
by such a devious approach. Rev. McKendree R. Long
T actually at times heard there Statesville

the basic proposition, stated by
Christ, that ‘tno man knoweth
the Father, but the Son. and he
to whom the Son will reveal
him” (Luke 10:22).

I know the ClioSophs at
Princeton invited in ‘dubious
discussers of doubtful mea-
sures.‘' but I never heard of
their Scrivening to the same
extent. Perhaps the images of
McQosh, Patton and Woodrow
Wilson forbid such blatant ex-
tremes there. And do not the
benign faces of Henry Louis

Dear Fditor:

If all students at Davidson
were born again Christians and
with many years of Christian
experience, in some cases their
faith might conceivably be rein-
forced by a limited amount of
atheistic propaganda; though do-
ing damage to others.

But many Davidson students
are not born again Christians,
and much of the teaching they
Teceive at Davidson is not of a
nature to immunize them against
atheist or Communist poison.
Under such conditions the ap-
pearance of atheist and com-
munist speakers at Davidson
will be disastrous to many an
inexperienced boy and girl—and
it may turn out to be your boy
or girl...

Colleges are strengthened by
encouraging Communist and
atheistic propaganda if it is the
purpose of such colleges to un-

“dermine Christianity by not only

teaching evolution, false econo-
mics and poltieial theories,
false and unproven criticisms of
the Bible, but by promoting and
encouraging the presentation
and thus the spread of atheistic
and communistic ideology.
Alfred L. Roberts

Freedom Gone Wild

What place does an atheist
have as an invited speaker at a
church related college?

What valid reason can there
be for the YMCA unit of a
church-related college inviting
an atheist to speak on ‘‘The Non-
Existence of God?”’

The answer to both questions
in an emphatic, None!

Will immature students (and
we do not use the word deroga-
torially) find such a lecture
helpful? Can such a ‘‘challenge
to Christian faith’ really con-
tribute to the strengthening of
Christian faith? We think not.

The Bible is very explicit
about atheists: ‘‘The fool hath
said in his heart, ‘There is no
God’ (Psa. 14:1 and 53;1). It
also makes many pointed obser.
vations about fools: “A fool
takes no pleasure in understand.
ing but only in expressing his
opinion” (Prov. 18:2).

The address by Dr. Michael
Scriven, Professor of History
and Logic at the University of
Indiana before the Davidson Col-
lege students on Feb. 4 reflects
little credit to the institution or
on those directly or permissively
responsible of the invitation.

Students today meet tacit de-
nials of God everywhere. Why
should the Church add another?

ADVICE TO THE BEGINNER:

HOW TO MASTER SKIING
IN ONE FATEFUL WEEKEND

BY RICK VON UNWERTH
Staff Sklier

In the unchallenging postlude after Mid-term Exam-
inations and the month or so before the new semester

souciant eye about for relaxing diversion. May | suggest

a quiet weekend on skiis.

sitting down in the same old way day after day quite like
a few carefree hours on the slopes. J submit that nothing
will be quite the same after a plunge or two down a glis-
tening, snow-greased mountain.

Perhaps tie soundest argument in favor of
skiing for the novice lies in its basic simplicity.

tration, but once you're up there getting down is

Students Lift Library Books
In Honor Concept Violation

BY HOWARD ARBUCKLE
Honor Court Chairman

In theory and in practice a student enters Davidson
a gentleman. The college receives him as a gentleman,

treats

him: as a gentleman, and resolutely refuses to know

him in any other character unless he proves himself

unworthy

of this trust. This trust is the foundation of

Davidson and the basis of the Honor System. This trust

offers privileges and
easier to possess the
bility.

The college library is operated
on the open stack system: that
is, students may browse in the
stacks, and the students them-
selves assume the responsibility
for checking out books. The
library is the most obvious and
odious example of the privilege
of student responsibility and
neglect for the trust implied by
the Honor System.

During the last two library
fiscal years 428 books have
been counted as missing.
These books turn up only in
the library inventory because
they were never checked out.
A book removed from the li-
brary without proper checking
out Is lost to all other usérs,
and in many schools is regard-
ed as an honor offense.

At Davidson a lenient one
dollar fine is levied as a small
reminder to be more considerate
in the future. The lenient fine
and a second chance shows the
faith the faculty and adminis.
tration have in Davidson stud-
ents. But the students are not
living up to this trust. It is
ironic that students can take
books in this manner and then
criticize the library for not hav:
ing enough books.

Abuse of the open stack sys-
tem became so serious this year
that the college felt it necessary
to take steps to remedy the sit-
vation. During the Christmas
break Mrs. Moore and the li-
brary staff went through several
dorms and without going into
trunks, drawers, etc., found 69
unchecked out books. A notice
was sent to both roommates and
it asked the .person responsible
to kindly return the books and
pay the lenient fine by January
10, Some of the books recorded
as missing suddenly turned up
on the shelves and the fine was
not paid. About a third have yet
to return the books or pay the
fines.

It is contemptible to see suck
childish irresponbility at David-
son. It is a contemptible thing
to see a student take advantage

responsibility. All too often it is
privileges and ignore the responsi-

of trust and a second chance to
save a couple of dollars. It is a
contemptible thing to see a val-:
uable reference book taken from
the library by one person when
a whole class needs it.

It is a contemptible thing to
see books taken from the re-
serve room and have these
books mutilated. Finally, it is
a contemptible thing to see
privileges taken advantage of
and responsibilities neglected.
Through the inconsideration of

a few irresponsible students the
privileges offered by the open
slack system are threatened.
The alternatives to the open
stack. system are repulsive and
in discord with the principles of
the college.

A closed stack system makes
research more difficult and does
not give the intellectual stimula-
tion that can come when one
comes in personal contact with
interesting works. A monitor
system is a childish and dis-
trustful method of checking
everyone for books as they leave
the library.

The only solution to this prob-
lem besides the threat of
harsher punishment is an appeal
to a student’s sense of respon
sibility and his sense of honor.
Society functions least well in
direct proportion to lack of -
trust. But, the expectation of
trust—the chance to prove that
one is worthy of trust—inspires
us all to do our best. This ap-
peal to self respect and ordinary
decency seldom finds a person
so lacking in these qualities as to
prove insensible to this appeal.

The need for library courtesy
and integrity has been shown.
Let this be an appeal to each
student's personal honor and let.
each student attempt to prove
himself worthy of the trust that -
has been invested in him. Let a
word to the wise be sufficient:
and, if some cannot cooperate,
let them pay a stiffer fine—the
loss of their personal integrity.
and the disdain and disapproval
of those they so inconsiderately
inconvenience.
