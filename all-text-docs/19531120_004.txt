Cunningham Addresses

Chicken Feed Tycoons

President John R. Cunningham
addressed a regional gathering of
Ralston Purina Company executives
in Asheville last Sunday, Novem-
ber 15th.

The founder and chairman of
the board of this milling. com-
pany is William H. Danforth. Mr.
Danforth is also president of the
Danforth Foundation which an-
nually grants fellowships for grad-
uate study. Allen Garrison of Lake
Wales, Florida, a member of Da-
vidson’s 1953 graduating class, re-
ceived one of these fellowships.

Wednesday, Dr. Cunningham
presided at the meeting of the
board of the American Association
of Colleges in Washington, D. C.
He is serving this year as presi-
dent of the association.

Off-Moorings . . .
(Continued From Page Two)
cerning the finances of the foot-
ball at Davidson might be termed
a minor issue if it weren't for two

important considerations.

There is no football scandal at

Davidson as to using general funds
for football scholarships. This does
not include those few scholarships
given in other sports. The entire
procedure has been one of good
business practices in the limits
placed on the Treasurer and the
General Scholarship Committee of
which Mr. Martin is chairman.
_ The limitation consists in hav-
ing to set up scholarships for the
football players without a positive
assurance of having all of it paid
for by the Wildcat Club.

The other important point to
consider is this. Davidson alumni
have had hard enough a time ban-
ning together and raising the
amounts they have. Even setting
higher gaols does not seem to pro-
duce better results.

The conclusion must obviously
be that unless there is some radi-
eal increase in the percentage of
‘alumni contributing or some
single large contributor turns up,
it is not possible for us to go in
for all out subsidization.

The only other source from
which the money for a subsidiza-
tion program could come would be
the general fund of the college.

for consolation honors.

In the 191-Ib class, Dave Burns
(SAE) decisioned Randy Johnson
(Pika) in the championship match.
Monty Littlejohn (Phi Gam) de-
feated Barney Poole (Phi Delt) for
third place.

In the heavyweight division,
Firor (Pi Kapps) won by a fall over
David Regen (Phi Delt): Long (Phi
Gam) came in third by a decision
over Lawing (Kappa S. 4).

To determine final team totals.
the following point system was de-
vised:

ist place—6 points
2nd place—4 points
3rd place—2 points
4th place—1 point
each fali—1 point

An ethical question arises here as
to whether a college should support
its football program in this way at
the possible expense of other func:
tions. Of more pragmatic value, is
the assumption that this view does
not coincide with the expressed
opinion of either Dr. Cunningham
or the Trustees.

It is not. an easy problem to
solve, and perhaps that is the only
conclusion that can assuredy be
made.

Big Improvement

This year’s cross-country team
has shown considerable improve-
ment over last year’s, which gained
only one win and finished eighth
in the Conference meet.

This year’s edition defeated
Richmond and William and Mary,
tied Maryville, and lost to N.C.
State, V.M.L, and W. and L., and
Duke for q 2-4-1 record. The third
place in the Conference meet is

were led by oxperts in the affairs
of these two countries.

A banquet topped off the day's
activities, and the togstmaster was
Sam Magill’s father, Mr. Orrin Ma-
gill, chairman of the United Na-
tions Seminar Committee. Dr. Ed-
win Espy, Executive of the Nation-
al Student Council YMCA, led the
invocation, and the speakers were
Mrs. Savilla Simons, General Sec-
retary of the National YWCA, and
Mr. Elmore Jackson, Consultant for
United Nations Representative for
India and Pakistan.

Following the banquet was a
party in which delegates got a
chance to get acquainted through
dancing and games. Davidson stu-
dents were surprised to find such
a big group of Southerners and dis-
covered that North Carolina had
the most representatives of any
state with large representations
from W. C,. State, Guilford and
Carolina.

The majority of the other groups
were from the Midwest and New
England. With the exception of the
University of Nebraska, Davidson
had the largest delegation.

Beginning the program Saturday
was a lecture on UNESCO by Dr.
Solomon Arnaldo, director of the
New York UNESCO office, in
which he explained the important
work being done in the fields of
education, science, and culture
through the United Nations. Many
consider this to be more im-
portant and lasting than the poli-
tical work the organization does.
Then came a complete tour of the
modern UN buildings, and another
visit to ‘the General Assembly.

The program Saturday was
brought to a close with an uptown
luncheon in which some of the
major impressions of the confer-
ence were discussed by Miss Jim-
mie Woodward, the director of the
Seminar, who talked briefly on
“What We Have Learned and What
We Can Do About It.” She was fol-
lowed by a student panel led by
Miss Fern Babcock, Program Sec-
retary, of the National YWCA on
“Effective Campus Programs on
World Affairs.”

Closing the discussions was Mr.
Ernest Lefever, Executive Director
of the Department of Internation-
al Justice and Goodwill of the Na-
tional Council of Churches, who
gave some thought-provoking ideas
on “Student Responsibility for
World Affairs.”

Saturday afternoon and evening
were free for sighteeing or the
theatre. Some of the Davidson
group spent the time touring
Rockefeller Center, visiting the
Empire State Building, and seeing
some of the other famed sights,.
while the rest of the group at-
tended such plays or musicals as
“Can Can,” “Wonderful Town,” and
“Picnic,”

A breakfast meeting officially
closed the Seminar Sunday morn-
ing. Mr. M. M. Thomas, Indian Stu-
dent Christian Movement leader,
spoke challengingly on “Christians
in the World Struggle.”

The group from Davidson, who
stayed at the Sloane House YMCA
on 34th Street, came back with a
keener insight into the problems
of the United Nations and a deeper
appreciation for their great contri-
butions to the betterment of hu-
manity. Some are already talking
of attending the spring conference
which will be held just after spring
holidays.
