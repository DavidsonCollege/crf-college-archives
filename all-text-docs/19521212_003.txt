FEATURE BY HUNTER STRADER:
Fraternities Continue Their Five-Year Tradition Of Barium Springs

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Barium Home
Grows Strong

In 62 Years

“The history of the Presbyterian
Orphan's Home is primarily and
essentially one of human values.
As the onward and steady progress
of this work is’ recorded for pos-
terity in the semi-centennial year
of the Home it will be kept in
mind that behind every building
at Barium Springs, behind every
will in which this Home has been
generously remembered, and behind
the several millions of dollars
which have been contributed by
liberal friends since the inception
of this Home, has been the prin-
cipal and actuating thought that
all of this has been done out of
a sense of love for dependent chil-
dren, an innate desire to help in
their maintenance and to play a
part in training them to be Chris-
tian men and women.”

Sixty-two Years

The above is a quotation from
a book published in 1941 marking
the fiftieth year of the Barium
Springs Orphanage’s service to the
unfortunate children of this and
surrounding areas.

It expresses the deep conviction
of those who are and have been
closely connected with the orphan-
age.

Though written eleven years ago,
these words are even truer today
in a world which many, justly or
unjustly, believe to be cold and
calculating.

The physical progress of the
home has been a marvelous one
in the span of sixty years since its
inception.

From twelve children, a single
building, and twenty-five acres, the
home has expanded to include over
300 children, more than fifty build-
ings, and well over one thousand
acres. The nominal value at the
beginning has increased until the
physical pliant and endowment of
Barium Springs was estimated
shortly before World War IT to be
over one million dollars. This fig-
ure has, of course, increased con-
siderably since that time, and to-
day the home is a beehive of activ-
ity and fruitful productiveness.

In the preceding paragraph is
couched the material progress that
has been made, but behind this
ever increasing value of buildings,
land, apd endowment, there is a
glowing history that rebounds to
the Synod of North Carolina and
to the thousands upon thousands
of people who have played their
part in this advancement. To some
special individuals who have been
endowed with wealth can be found
living memorials which have been
made possible by their wise use of
material possessions entrusted to
their care.

Pre-History

The home at Barium Springs
was established on January 11,
1891, but there was a preliminary
history. The purchase of a build-

ing with twenty-five adjoining
acres and the coming of children
to Barium Springs was preceded
by a private home for boys and
girls established in Charlotte in
1883 which was supervised by some
ladies in that city until the Synod
decided to establish a permanent
orphans’ home at the present Jo-
cality.

The building purchased was a
two-story wooden structure, form-
erly used as a hotel, which stood
on the sight of the present Rumple
Hall. In November of 1891 ‘this
building was completely destroyed
by a fire, and the children were
housed temporarily in Statesville
until plans could be made for an-
other building at Barium Springs.

Mr. George W. Watts, of Dur-
ham, challenged the Synod to give
a sum of money for a building, and
promised to give a like amount
for another cottage. The Synod
accepted his challenge, and Mr.
Watts immediately gave the money
for the construction of Annie
Louise Cottage, built in 1892 and
named for his only daughter, Annie
Louise Watts. Before this was

completed, the Synod’s “cottage
was under way, and it was like-
wise finished in 1892, ~

Over the years since 1892 thou-
sands of contributions have made
possible the construction and de-
velopment of Barium Springs as
it stands today. It is remarkable
to note the number of buildings
which have been constructed from
the contribution of one sum. In
the majority of cases, each. cot-

PURCELL:TO MARRY MISS BRADLEY

rar:

On December 20, 1952, Professor James Purcell of the David-
son English Department will marry Mise Betty Bradley, Dr. D.
Grier Martin’s secretary of last year.

The above picture of the couple was tsken at Mrs. Little's
home when a party was given by friends for the couple.

They will be married in Bristol, Virginia, with only close friends
of the couple and families attending.

Mr. Purcell has been officially declared winner of the sandwich
dates and now starte his brand new “career.”

tage in which the children live is
the result of a single bequest by
one person or one group of per-
sons. This home has long at-
tracted the attention of many gen-
erous laymen and it may be of
particular interest to the present
day Davidson student. body to note
that the late Mr. W. P. Stultz of
Charlotte, who gave so generous-
ly to the new church, contributed
the necessary money for a cottage
at Barium Springs.
Thriving Community

Today the home is a_ thriving
community in itself. Both the boys
and girls take a vital interest in
the activites involving the main-
tenance and supply ofs the insti-
tution. Children under ten years of
age have few tasks to perform,
but from then on until their grad-
uation they have a regular sched-
ule of work, thereby giving them
valuable training in the responsi-
bilities of later life, as well as
helping to make the home more

morc self-sustaining.

Those dutics falling to. the
fairer sex include such jobs as pre-
paring the meals, washing the
never-ending stream of dishes, can-
ning food in the fall, working in
the laundry, assisting the matrons
in various cottages, and making
and ‘repairing much ‘of the cloth-
ing worn by the students.

The work of the boys js some-
what more varied, including milk-
ing the cows, working in the hun-
dred-acre garden, or in the orchard,
running the printing office and
shoe shop, or working along such
lines as carpentry, painting, and
various mechanical skills. 1

Thus the history of the Presby-
terian Orphanage has been one of
sincere concern for the. well-being
of young pctople in our modern
society. Barium Springs offers all
its students an opportunity to pur-
sue not. only a pleasant life, but
also one of true Christian fellow-
ship and productive well-being.

“Boy, did you see Sandy Claus
with that fake beard tonight?”

“Yeah, but that ice cream was
real,”

Such was probably a typical con-
versation on the buses Jast night
carrying the children back to the
Presbyterian Orphanage at Barium
Springs. Tt was pretty apparent
that “Sandy Claw’s” beard wasn’t
his own, but everyone knew the
spirit of Christmas was very real
before the night was over.

Twelve groups of children rang-
ing in age from six to fourteen

made their annual visit to the
Davidson College campus last
night, and as” always, the hosts

enjoyed the visit just as much as
the guests did, if not more. The
buses arrived at 7:00 p.m. in front

cach of the fraternities and the
Campus Club. After a few hurried
greetings and’ shy glances, the chil-
dren tromped into the auditorium
to watch that allztime favorite of
Christmas plays, “Why, the Chimes

The play was produced. by the
Red and Black Masquers especial-
lv for the occasion, and was their
-own gift to the guests from Ba-
rinm Springs. Directed by Tad
Currie, the play starred Robert
Mims as Hogar, the little boy;
Kerrie Spiers as his brother Steen;
Vance Mizell as Uncle Bertel; and
Peggy Whittle as the old woman.
The supporting cast were Tink
‘Taylor as ‘the priest; Mary Beaty
as the young girl; Bill Pharr as
a courtier; and George Walker as
the king. Music was furnished by
Bill Johnson and Bill Crymes, with
sets by Tad Currie and costumes
by Courtney Hill.

Well, of course the chimes did
ting last night as they do every
Christmas for little Hogar as he
places the pennics on the altar for
the Christ Child, but the Davidson
student body fas been trying to
make them ring especially for the
children of the Presbyterian Or-
phanage since the’ Christmas of
1947 when the first Barium Springs
Christmas party was held. That
night, December 17, to -be exact.
there were stunts, movies, gifts

Since then, the students of Da-

to capture a part of the true mean.
ing of the Yuletide season by en-
tertaining these children. Last
night, after the curtain had fallen
in Chambers, the group went to
the various houses where they
were to be entertained for the re-
mainder of the evening.
