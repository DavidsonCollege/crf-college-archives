OPEN HOUSE... You Georgians and Watt-

professor or your boarding house keeper

breaks into the seclusion of your private room

Thursday aiternoon! Is merely part of Mrs.

Smith's exeellent plan to give the faculty and

towns-pcopie an opportunity to see what the

inside of a dormitory is like. We thoroughly |
sympathize with Mrs. Smith's idea, and we
don't dlame her for wanting to show off some
of the well-kept college rocms. Let's co-
operate and give the visitors a fine impression
of Davidson dormitory lite. There are alot of
improvements to be made on our part. and
here's a start. 1.éts make our rooms neater
and cleaner yet!

BRING QUEENS BACK! ... According to all
reports, Queens Day was a hWarious success
and “a.good time was had by all.” Everything
seemed to click with precision due, not merc-
ly to the committee's etfinent tunetroning, but
to the wholehearted support of the entire stu-
dent body. And why shouldn't such a thing

REPLY TO FORUM’. . . Davidson Callege is
widely known for the democratie spirit of its
_Stiulent body. Recently a non fraternity man,
believing steadiastly that the pen is mightier:
than the sword, took to his typewriter and
produced a biting criticism in which he cast
aspersions upon the cditorial policy ot The
Davidsonian. In reply we should like vo point
out that news és news, regardless of whom it
concerns, and that we fill our columns with
that in mind. Granted, that Grecks take a

prominent place in the news, but that is only-— Git) be coming along soon, and 1 know you

right. After all, one of the principal aims of
fraternity is the further deveiopment of quali-
ties of leadership in its members. When a
freshman is pledged by a fraternity, he is
urged to take part in as many extra curricular
activities as possible, and from that he is able
to work steadily upward to a position of lead-
ership.—O. I. LB.

TO THE EDITOR... The opinions expressed
below arc not necessarily those of the editorial
staff. This is an editorial upon a subject which
has undergone lively debate in other institu-
tions of the State. At.the request of certain

STAFF ELECTIONS ... Last week a sug-
gestion was made that we might try to take
publications out of campus politics, to award
editorship of this publication at least on the
basis of merit, of work, ability, knowledge of
the field, and ability to get along with the staff
rather than personal popularity or the influ-
ence of some political clique. As one of our
cbntemporaries pointed out in a similar cam-
paign recently, the man who is conscientiously

wonking on his publication, familiarizing him-
self with its technique and its problems has
little time to be running about the campus
meeting people and “getting known.” The
fact that most of the more competent staff
weavers serve on two or three publications as
underelessmen further limits. their outside
time.

Advantages, of the stati or merit system
of election are obvious. Some of the most out-
standing reasons jor the change: (1) the edi-
torship of a publication is by nature a tech-
nical position. (2) The staff of a publication
is most competent to know the qualifications
necessary for an editor and to judge which
member of the staff has these netessary quali-
tieations. (3) Statt elections shift whe em-
phasts from popularity or political backing

“as the primary qualification for editorship to
journalistie ability ard service to the publi-
cation (+) for the reasons above, underclass-
men members of the staff would tend to work
hard, realizing that they will be graded on
work and ability rather than the opinion of a
group watamiliae with and in a large measure
uninterested in their efiorts. (5) Staff elec-
tions estaplished a reciproeal fecling of re-
sponsibility berveen the editor and his staff
not always possible now when the stati must
accept the political choice of outside groups.

These advantages mean only one thing, they
speak for themselves, a possibility for better
publication '— EX-STAFPFER.

Reeause Pm not @ senior I don’t have to
start worrying yet about what I'm going to
do next year, And even if ) were.a senior, |
don't believe Ud be very worried for the simple
reason that Talready know what U'm going to
do when [ get out of school. Fm going to

found a college of my own, and it’s as simple
as that. Let me teil you about it.

Down Somewhere around the tropic regions
there's a little island whieh is called Palm Is-
land because it is covered with palm trees.
The sun never shines on Palm Island. How
could it when the languid South Sea moon
glows twenty four hours a night? There are
no mountains nor his on the island because
the whole thing is nothing but one big palm-
studded beach, like Myrtle. There are so
many brown-skinned natives strumming on
guitars that one has difficulty in turning over.
That's where my college is going to be
located.

The entranee requirements will be rather
stiff, but they shouldn't worry many of the
applicants. Each boy seeking admission must
bring as sufficient credentials a girl of his
choosing ~ young. beautiful, ete. Likewise
each girl must be accompanied by a boy—
young, handsome, etc. In this way cvery-
body will have something to play with and the
administration will not be put to the expense
of buying such oddities as footballs and basé-
ball bats. Tihat's really a very good idea.

Matrieulation must be completed in ten
years’ time becayse after you get old and ugly
yqu're just as welloff at some ordinary college
or university. Students will be graded every
iwo years on such points as: natural aptitude,
practical application, proportion of- subject
covered, and so forth. lf a student is found
lo be faiting atorg these lines, he will be ex-
pected, of course, to repeat the. work in which
he was delinquent, If it's a she the same thing
eves. Each applicant for admission will be
warned to.bring another bathing suit besides
the one he or she is wearing.

Now, I realize that very few of you David-
son men have any children as yet, but they

wamt to plan for them nothing but the best.
Consequently I’m giving you this opportunity
to enter your kids on the waiting list now be-
fore it’s too late. Certainly you don’t want
your child to go to some college where they
require you to go to class. The old system
here at Davidson is all right for our stable
generation, but think of the future.

Ineidentalty, we could use a few changes
around here like a new library, infirmary,
gym, ctc., but what we really need, what we
all seem to agree that we want and absolutely
must have to help us get a thorough cultural
edueation, is a bunch of new ideas (like minc)
to renovate this place completely. Why,
haven’t we been trying for years to drill it
into the heads of the administration that we
must have more amusement, better entertain-
ment, greater things to take our minds off our
work, and stuff like that? Boys, I’m going
crazy. On some days I have to go to three
classes. It’s unfair. Just wait until I get a
chance to gripe about it---WADE BARROW.

THE TEACHER

Whatescroll shall tell the teacher's
honest worth,

Or find the certain measure of his
meed? .

He takes his valiant stand upon
the earth, 4

And serves with: selfless love the
children’s need.

He battles darkness and its subtle
‘Art,

He wakes thé sleeping spirit, quiets

We lights a candle in a questing
heart, ‘ .

Rejoicing in its gleam in- after
years,

He keeps the faith. He patiently
explores

The minds whose burgeoned prom-
ise he believed.

He shares his joy in knowledge,
opens doors

On far horizons yet to be achieved.

Not fame nor fortune his, but this
his fee,

His purpose and reward: the child
set free. :

NUTSHELI

Ever since somebody. said “down
with capitalism” a few weeks ago,
the potential soap box orators have
had their heyday.
~ Looks like the fraternities voted

themselves into the well known
bind when they decided to “share
the wealth” with the Pan-Hellenic
Council. One is tempted to believe
that they didn’t stop to think about
the liability, but thought that
henceforth every dance set would
be just like Mid-Winters and some
loose change, in hundred dollar bills
would be floating around like au-
tumn leaves,

Well, all the shouting is over and
now comes the real test. Right now
it seems that-the individual frater-
nities will turn out about twenty-
five per cent for a «set of four
dances at one dollar each with
Frank Dailey'’s orchestra. No doubt
the most reasonable and best Bow-
ery Ball ever put on for Davidson.

The Brotherhoods are going to
think twice about sharing the
wealth if they have to dig into the
treasury and produce seventy-five
or a hundeed dollars. The point be-
ing that if the fraternities expect
to put over their self-styled pro-
gram, they'N have to put out and
support it.

The military boys are in for a
treat at the Friday afternoon pa-
vade when Lieut.-Col. Jack Branch
will present battalion sponsor Dot
Bagwell. That ought to be a draw-
ing card. Then Friday night at
the formal dance, Scabbard and
Blade will strut forth
pressive figure.

~ Queens Day Post Mortem—
Major Clark managed to get a

date for the. Junior-Senior at

Queens. “Speedy” Roberts in the

arms of Morpheus on the stage.
Fred Smith on the receiving end of

the vegetables. To high scorer
Dell Sutherland goes first “prize
for victimizing Hugh Gracey, Ken
Fryfogle and Pete Marchant. And
poor Julius Crowell.

Many a young romance should
blossome forth from Queens Day
activitiés.

Signs of Spring—

Daily mecca at the athletic field
semi-nudist colony. “Barber's re-
venge” haircuts. “Love-bug” infec-
tion. Meticulous white linen suits;
and imagine it, they can now be

worn without the wearer keeping:

away from windows to avoid being
drowned. Perhaps a sign that we
are returning to civilization.

Costume Suggestions For
Bowery—

You could well imagine “Dopey”
Lutz as a bathroom Fixture inspec-
tor, or perhaps Schnozz Hill with
a weathervane on his head. Harold
“Reddog” Sugg went last year as
a money-bag Pan-Hellenic man.
This year he'll have to revise his
constitution and go as a reformed
“share the wealth” representative.
Jim Morton of poetry -writing fame
would look good as poet laureate.
Everybody agrees that “cheu-cheu”
Edwards would feel at home in a
railroad engineer's outfit. Since
the love bug has chewed on Worth
Sprunt, he ought to look cute as
Cupid. Archer Torrey, in keeping
with an ancient precedent, might
like to go as a classic Greek. Would-

n't Al Cade look natural as a gar-

bage collector?

The Centennial pageant is defi-
nitely a very good plan, especially
with exams ending on Wednesday.
There seems to be some trouble,
however in getting the livestock
for the staging. Tyler’ Port radio-
advertised for a “yock of oacksen”
recently. The student body should
be able to supply some horses but
mules, oxen and pigs won't be so
easy.

Faculty Day—
_Mrs. Smith’s idea of having open

‘| house for the faculty and towns-

®

people’ seems to be a good one even:

if it is a little hard on those of us
who are agin living in clean rooms.
From four until five tomorrow af-
ternoon, the first -floors of Georgia

and Watts dormitories will be open :

for inspection. After the inspec-
tion is over, the sightseers will be
itivited over into the parlor of
Watts, where, not tea, but punch,
will be served, and Dr, Burwelh
who was here at the time of Wood-
row Wilson, will be interviewed.
