LEPHANTS

The elephant is man’s most intelligent helper.
But—consider this interesting comparison:

An elephant is much larger than the electric

“yarder”’

or logging machine. The

“yarder” has the power of twenty elephants; it
handles clusters of logs; it works dependably,
twenty-four hours at a stretch, if necessary.

Twenty elephants would eat daily 10,000 pounds
of green food, which a corps of attendants must
gather. A motor “eats” nothing but electricity,
supplied at the throw of a switch.

Two million elephants could
not do the work now being
done by General Electric
motors. Whatever the work
to be done, whether it needs
the power of an elephant or
the force of a man’s arm,
there is a General Electric
motor that will do it faith-
fully for a lifetime at a cost
of a few cents an hour.

Power used in the modern industrial world is
applied through electric motors—tireless
elephants” that are relegating antiquated ma-
chines to museums, along with such oldtime
household articles as wash-tubs and ordinary
irons—and stuffed elephants.
