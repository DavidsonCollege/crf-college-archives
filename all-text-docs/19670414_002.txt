Not Subversive

As the Residence Hall Association
tries to establish ils existence az a
truly functional organ of student gav-
erament on campus, il is important
that its real purpose be known both
by the students who nrust make 31 op-
erate as well as by the administration
which must realize ite powuntial bene-
fit 10 the college.

Perhaps it is a reflection of the sort
of lack of trusi between generations
that Ed Dwelle mentions elsewhere
on this page. Perhaps it is the security
of avoiding increased student govern-
ment. Whatever the reason, the belief
seems lo have grown up among some
members of the administration that
the association is merely an effort on
the part of students to gain a free
hand in determining the rules of their
life here im order to live an anarchic
life of dorm room boozin' and sex.

This is surely overstating the case.
Aftec witnessing the generally success-
ful history of increasing student pow-
@r on campus. certainly the present
power structure could not see the stu-
dents’ desire for more self-govern-
ment as only a search for the right to
Tun lonse and wild. Yet, the sentiment
has been voiced that the real function
of the Residence Hall Association ts
hiddea underneath its denials and be-
hind the solid coordination of students
and other members of the administra-
tion who helped draw up the canstitu-
tion of the association. According to
this line of thought, the subversive
function of the organization is primar-
ily io obtaln ihe approval of opening

Abdication

Peitzel Suider, Class of ‘537, made a
large isswe of the abdication of stu-
dent responsibility for aleabol on cam-
fés when he appeared at last week's
Aleahol Forum. His point was soeme-
what denied in the minds of his stu.
deat listeners, but it comes home
soundly in an action taken by the Fae-
oity Executive Commiltee this week,

The committee rujed against a move
by Bill Watson, new chairman of the
Student Rody Regulations Court, 10
bave the cose of a student charged
with possession of alcohal on campus
Itnnsterted to the jurisdéctian of the
stiident court Parl of the reasoning
used by the faculty committer for its
doelaton lay in the arguinent that the
student body had In fact abdicated any
Thuhl 10 self-geverninent un this iesue
last yeor by eliminating from = the
Stndent Body Constitution the mile
against possesstun of etcohol on cam
pus.

Their reasoning on thls dectelon
seems quite sound. In a constitulinaal
soajety courts do net have the right to
trv individuals for actiens which do
not vinlate any rules of tbat society.

it is true that this particulsr pro-
posal might make the most readable
sort of headline for the alumni jour-
nal or the Presbytorian Survey. On the
other hand it is ol the idea that
seams to be of the most cancern to the
association. Nor is it the one idea
which will accomplish the actual goal
of the association, which is simply to
rovide a living atmosphere canduec-
ve to the sort of attitude whith stu-
denis mast devetop in order to make
the most of their four years at David-
son. Tie assoviation realizes thal the
Jack of concern by stucents for their
residences is just as important as the
fact that the dormitories are so spar-
tan that they hardly seem to deserve
care. From the statements of Mrs. Pe
fer Nicholls. supervisor of the darins
and one of the initiators of the associa-
tion, it seems that the infamous Open
House is little more than a means of
stimulating the desire in students to
take care of their surroundings in such
a way that they would not have to be
ashamed to have outsiders see the
way they live. Providing more civi-
lized surroundings is another solution
they seek to this preblem. Both of
these means are imporiant ways of ac-
complishing the basic goal of the as
sociallon. While others have spoken
of an Open House as g first step to-
ward making Davidson co-educational,
this does not seem to be the goal of
the Residence Hall Association. It is
not fair to the founders of the asso-
cation to claim that this is their real

purpose.

inally one more Scholar was suppased
fo have particinoled in the current
program. and ihe funrs to support

im were allotted by ihe Richardson
Foundation. For saine reason the
young man for whom this scholarship
was intended meyer appeared at Da-
vidson As a consequence, the money

wetly Hee unused.

ars ahool #a00 to use to gain o brood

The fallacy af trying to buv friends
was Fhown hy the eventual entlapse of
President Taft's “Dollar Diplemavy.”
The expression of gratitudy fer pasi-
live heip, however, is p time-honored
exprecdoo of politeness if nothing
eke. The cantribation that the Rich-
arficnn Scholars have made this vear
in Lheir active partiedpation in so many
afead of Pouvidsen College deserves
more than just a “Thank You" pote
jt the editorial calumna of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN.

In this particular instance, as in sew.
eral other areas, the student body does
indeed constitute a separate society
{rom that of the rest of the college.
Until that “Great Day of Judgment”
when this dichotomy is pushed away,
it will remain a fact of life with which
students must live while they seek to
solve the prontem,

The decision by the Executive Com-
Mittee demonstrates the fact that etim-

of discipline to be used how it wants,
