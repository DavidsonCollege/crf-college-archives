Forty Students Tutor Davidson Youth

By TOM BRUCE
Contributing Editor

Forty students, both male and
female, at Davidson are
meeting at least once a week
with young boys and girls from
the Davidson area as part of the
YMCA’s tutorial program,
STEP.

The tutors are drawn from
every class at Davidson and
some of them have been
involved in the ‘effort for four
years. Likewise, the _ tutees
come from all grades of
elementary school and many of
them have been tutored for
several years.

‘‘We generally just play
around,” explained sophomore
Kenny Eiler. ‘‘We go bicycling,
play pool, and study together a
little. At first we used to hit the
books hard, but we tired of that
pretty quick, so now we do what
we want todo.”

The formula seems to be
almost universal: An afternoon
a week spent _ playing
basketball, throwing frisbees,
swimming at the college pool,
and topped off with occasional
study.

“I like to come out to the
school and I like the things we
do. I like to play pool and to
study sometimes. My grades
have gone up since I started
working with Kenny,” said
Darrel Houston, a fourth grader
from the Davidson Elementary
School. Eiler and Houston are
Starting their second year
together this year.

Greg Gerdy, the Y's director
of the STEP program, says that
the program is a real success,
but ‘‘I still wish we could have
more participation. There
should be more in a school of
this type where students have
free time and are interested in
the community.”

On Tuesday the APO chapter
at Davidson sponsored a picnic
for the STEP tutors and tutees.
About 50 people gathered in
Hobart Park for hot dogs, after
an hour or more of playing
touch football on the soccer
field.

Frank Farmer, an APO
officer, said that the club had
planned the picnic because they
liked to support the STEP
program.

“I tutored the same kid for
two years, and I also tutored
before that in my hometown.
This year I am doing something
a little different and tutoring in

piano,” he said. ‘My tutee was
having trouble reading and I
talked to his teacher about it.

“She recommended some
exercizes we could practice and
I think he really showed some
improvement," he said.

Farmer said that he did not
know why he was involved with
tutoring. ‘I guess it is in my
blood, since both of my parents
are teachers. I like the
involvement, but I really don't
have any one over-riding reason
for doing it."’

Several of the tutors have a
history of involvement in
teaching and counseling. Whit
Hutchison, a sophomore, has
done inner-city work in Atlanta
in connection with his .church
and he says that he is drawn to
tutoring for the same reasons as
to the inner-city work.

“I would like to be involved
in the larger Davidson
community. not just with
college-related people and not
just the professors and their
families,’ he said.

‘I think that there is a need
for greater rapport between the
college and _ the _ black
community, and that this is an
important part of Davidson's
commitment to the church,”
Hutchison explained.

Gerdy stated that the basis
for the program was academic
counseling. ‘‘The tutor acts as

sort of an encouraging big
brother, who asks him about his
school work and expresses a
positive interest in his
problems," he said.

‘*I was interested in the STEP
program because it is such a
worthwhile way to spend time.
You can't study 24 hours a
day,’’ Gerdy said.

‘*‘At the same time he offers
constructive suggestions and
tries to effect some kind of
improvement with the help of
the teacher.

“If you become bogged down
in academic work and start
asking a lot of questions, this
seems to be a healthy release,”
he continued. ‘‘With me, it’s
pretty basic instinct and at the
same time a personal need.

‘Then there's the question of
your influence on the boy, both
good and bad,’ Gerdy said. ‘‘I
think the kid will usually
respond in a very dramatic way
to your interest."

Hutchison's tutee, sixth
grader Lawrence Kerns voiced
one reaction that seems pretty
typical of the whole STEP
program. *“‘We do math and
science and also geography.

don't remember the name of the
place, but we had a great time,”
he said.

Pindar Denies Black Request
For Activities Car Priority

By BETSY ALEXANDER
Staff Writer

The Black Student Coalition
(BSC) denied this week any
request for priority in the use of
a student activities car as
presented to the Senate.

George Pindar, speaking for
the BSC and as a member of the
Senate committee formed to
investigate the feasibility of a
student activities car, said ‘‘In
the proposal put before the

administra:ion, BSC asked that
there be a student car available
for black students’ use. We did
not ask for primary
consideration."’

The Senate passed
proposal as presented by the
Dean of Students Will Terry,
pending approval of the
committee’s recommendations
as to use, priorities and
maintenance. However as
presented to the Senate, the
BSC would have priority for the

car's use.

‘Part of the confusion,” said
Terry, ‘‘was because the car
was part of a list of requests
from the black students"
presented to the
administration.

According to Ralph Peeples,
president of SGA, in theory, the
students already have access to
a school car, but in practice,
they do not.

“The priority was assumed
for the black students,” said
Peeples. ‘‘Most of the
complaints from the students
were directed on the basis of
priorities. The controversy was
in response to the widespread
belief that black students would
have priority for the use of the
car, which I think can be
defended."

The idea of a_ student
activities car has been
considered many times before.
‘‘The administration,’ said
Peeples.”’ thought it would be a
good idea for a_ student
activities car and it would be
better if the students finance it.

“The foul up came in that we
had some difficulty
assertaining what the BSC
wanted,’ said Peeples.

According to Bill Mier,
chairman of the ad _ hoc
committee, they are trying to
decide who can use the car,
what for, how much to
charge. how many drivers and
who keeps the key.

The committee will meet
again today to complete the
details and to prepare the
proposal for the Senate.

evaluation.

People who don’t have a final
exam in a class should get a
questionnaire from _ their
professor and return it either
with another exam, to their
professor or to me."’

Damewood also instructed
that “‘students should fill out the
questionnaire during the exam
period if they have time or after
the exam period if they don't.
They should return the
questionnaire with the exam
but shouldn't leave it inside the
exam packet.”

Course evaluation booklets
have been compiled for the
three academic years before
this one. However, there has
been considerable
disagreement about whether or
not these booklets were helpful
to students.

Ralph Peeples, SGA
president, said that these
previous booklets were ‘‘not
professionally published and
not accurately valid.”

‘What I want is a document
that is valid and says something
about descriptions of courses,
students’ attitudes about
courses, and students’ attitudes
about teachers,"’ he said.

“It should give information
that is reliable, accurate, and
valid. A sampling from a few
people is not good,"’ he said.

Peeples emphasized that the
booklet was ‘‘no political move”
in that in no way was it designed
to threaten the faculty. ‘‘The
booklet is just a service which
needs'doing,”’ Peeples said.

Damewood thought that the
booklets the past three years
were “bulky” and sometimes
difficult to interpret. *‘We will
try to make them more usable,”
he said.

The format for next fall's
booklet will be decided on
during the winter term this year
based primarily on the response
from the questionnaires.

The questionnaires will
probably form most of the
booklet but other information
pertaining to courses will be
included.
