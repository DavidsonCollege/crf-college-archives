Davidsonian’s First Cross-Word Puzzle

Proves Success---

Bill Story, of shiekish fame, was the first ,
successful solver of the cross-word. puzzle
that appeared in The Davidsonian of Jan-
uary 15th. He brought the correct solution
into the editor at four bells and for his skill
in acrostics and phrasing, he receives the
prize of one subscription to the livest college
weekly in the South, Frank Hudson, Bill
Mattison, Arthur Gray, and several others
brought their solutions in just a little later.
The complete list has been lost, although the
intention was to give each one honorable
mention who brought in the correct solution.

Almost all the boys sent the puzzle to
their girls, who no doubt ran delicate fingers
through their bobbed tresses while trying to |

unfathom the mysterious words that wouldn't
fit. Among those who solved the puzzle
were Misses Po Rudisill, Frank Rudisill,
Don Smoot, Virginia Batte, and Lloyd Mer-
fiman, all of N. C. C. W.; Miss Mildred
Bushart, of Union City, Tenn.; Miss Mo-
zelle Horton, of Converse College, and oth-
ers whose names could not be secured.

The puzzler this week was laboriously
ground out by Kenneth “Ding-dong” Bell.
It is the plan of the editors to have different
fellows make up these puzzles from week to
week. By applying to the editor, or man-
aging editor, blanks for the puzzle can be
secured. The puzzle this week is not so
hard but is catchy. Try your skill in filling
the little squares, Here goes.

Winning the West

Le

The General Electric Com-
pany provides for agricul-
ture little motors that dothe
farm chores and great ones
that operate mammoth
pumps to irrigate vast
stretches of arid valleys.

If you are interested in
learning more about what
electricity is doing, write
for Reprint No. AR391 con-
taining a complete set of
these advertisements.

Irrigation by electrically driven pumps has made
hundreds of thousands of acres of desert land in the
Intermountain West blossom like the rose.

For a few cents a month per acre, electricity—the giant

worker—brings the life-giving water from distant lakes
and rivers to rainless valleys, producing. rich harvests
of fruits and vegetables, cereals and forage.

What electricity is doing for the farmer is only a
counterpart of what it is doing for Industry, Trans-
portation, City and Country life or any cf the profes-
sions. It is a tool ready for your use and which, wisely
used, will make the impossible of today an accomplished

fact tomorrow.

How electricity does these things is important to the
student in a technical school—but what electricity can
do is important to every college man or woman, no
matter what their life’s work may be.
