THE OVERWORKED ISSUE

Life Is. "Too Short

Michael ’ Vick Re Returns 3 fon

Prison “A Changed Man”

Philadelphia— Philadelphia
Eagles quarterback returned to
NFL play against the Kansas
City Chiefs after spending 18
months in federal prison for
running dogfights.

“Prison changes a man. As
a haven away from the hustle
and bustle of everyday life, it
was a place for me to re-eval-
uate my goals and behavior,”
Vick said. “As a professional
athlete, I deal with a lot of
stress and pressure. In prison
that stress isn’t there. Everyone’s
so welcoming and helpful, guiding
each other to become better, fuller
humans.”

Vick praised the efficiency
and fairness of the American legal
system and also lauded the federal
penitentiary department.

“In prison, that stress...
isn't there. Everyone’s

so welcoming, guiding
each other to become

better humans.”

“It’s great. They treat you po-
litely, and the facilities at the pris-
ons are top-notch! Frankly speak-
ing, the gym at the prison is better
than anything I’ve encountered in
the state of Pennsylvania.”

Ricky “Rusty Shank” Marquez,
Vick’s roommate during his stay at
Leavenworth Penitentiary, says he
enjoyed Vick’s company.

“He’s a genuinely good guy,”
Marquez said. “We all get caught
up in a bad activity every once in
a while...selling drugs to 13 year-
olds, stabbing your uncle to death
with a boxcutter...prison is about
sharing experiences and trying to
grow closer as a community of
convicts.”

Vick has renounced his dog-
fighting ways. In an interview
Monday, Vick mentioned that he
no longer wishes to starve pit bulls
and German shepherds for days, so
that they will kill each other over a
piece of chicken gristle.

“Tt’s unfair to the animals, it
really is,” he said.

Vick plans on converting the
extensive kennel compound he
constructed to a more peaceful pur-
pose. “Vick’s Veterinary Center”
will be opening in the fall of 2010.

“We have this amazing facility,
and we should put it to good use,”
said Dolla Bill, who used to con-
vert Vick’s pets into bloodthirsty
killing machines.

Banjo, a stray, is excited to join
Vick’s new canine outreach program

“The cages are kind of small,
but they should work fine for lap-
dogs such as pomeranians and chi-
huahuas. And the fight pit already
has grates built in so that blood
can drain out. It will be the perfect
spot for a pet washing station!”

The animals that are currently
in Vick’s care, however, see the
issue differently. When “Number
12,” Vick’s prized pit bull, was ap-
proached about the new program,
his eyes turned red and he tore the
throat out of a reporter. Experts
worry that the dogs he abused will
remain aggressive.

Public opinion, though, has
turned unilaterally in Vick’s favor.
After his arrest in 2007, violent
crime and animal-cruelty rates
plummeted.

Vick explains to the press that he is
the “#1 Dog Lover” in the world

“Michael Vick single-handedly
stopped dozens, if not hundreds,
of crims from occurring simply by
stopping committing them himself.
He is, I dare say, one of our city’s
finest crime-fighters,” a spokes-
person for the Philadelphia Police
Department said.

Michael Vick is being con-
sidered for a vast array of civic
awards thanks to his reduction
of Vick-committed crimes. He is
excited about the current football
season, but is also excited for his
upcoming vacation: “I’m bringing
my guns to Africa and getting my
own ivory,” Vick said, grinning.

Major Disappointment:
The Yowl’s Handy Guide

Description: Classics majors
are generally spoiled rich kids
who are too obstinate to take a
language course that actually mat-
ters. Classics majors are tied at
third with Political Science majors
for attempts to domineer conversa-
tions towards material covered by
their major (English takes first and
is followed closely by Econom-
ics). Classics majors also have
the hardest time explaining their
majors to laymen and invariably
get frustrated after doing so over
and over again. Because Classics
covers history and archaeology, it
is barely more useful than Philoso-
phy, which is totally uselesss.
