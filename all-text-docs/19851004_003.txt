businessmen and representatives of for-
eign companies signed their names to
newspaper advertisements stating,
“There is a better way.” In the U.S.,

coins; the measure came as a follow-up to
the limited economic sanctions imposed
in early September.

The U.S.S.R announced the retire-

Nikolai Ryzhkov (56), a close ally of
Communist Party leader Gorbachov, has
been named his sucessor in what is
viewed as a further consolidation of Gor-
bechov’s power. The U.S.S.R and Oman
announced plans to establish diplomatic
ties. Meanwhile, in apparent protest of
the U.S.S.R.’s support of Syria, two sep-
arate groups of gunmen in Moslem con-

Embassy doctor; one diplomat has been
killed, and both groups are threatening to
execute the other three.

In other Middle East developments
— much to the displeasure of Israel, the
U.S. announced plans to sell arms to Jor-

Anderson, Savarese join College faculty

Lyle Anderson

Lyle V. Anderson has joined
the philosophy department as a
visiting assistant professor for this
year.

Anderson is from Lake Wobe-
gon, Minn., and graduted from
St. Olaf College in Minnesota.
Although he majored in philoso-
phy, religion and art, he was origi-
nally interested in the sciences.
He earned his M.Div. at the Di-
vinity School of Yale. He con-
tinued studies in Copenhagen for
one year, where he focused on the
works of Kierkegaard. He also at-
tended Cornell for one year and
Yale for two years.

He received his Ph.D. in phi-
losophy in 1980 after completing
a dissertation conceming the rela-
tion between motivation and ra-
tionality in Aristotle and his
theory of action. Anderson wants
to write essays on ethics and
metaphysics, in which he may in-
clude a new theory of action.

An active member of the
peace movement, Anderson
helped found the Abbey Hills Na-
tional Peace Academy in Ohio.
Anderson wrote the constitution,
organized the curriculum and as-
sembled a scholastic journal for
the Academy. The Academy
serves aS a retreat and an educa-
tional institution for noncredit
academics.

As for special interests and
hobbies, Anderson claims that
“basketball is his religion.” He

This week's safety tip hits the road: buckle

By RAY THROWER

On Tuesday, October 1, 1985,
a new North Carolina Law came
into effect. The new Seat Belt
Law will! make it mandatory for
what most people admit they
ought to do anyway but don’t:
buckle up. The new law states that
everyone over the age of 6 who is
riding in the front seat of a motor
vehicle must wear seat belts. Fail-
ure to comply will be seen as an

has been captain of two unde-
feated intramural teams and plays
now with the “noon hour faculty
group.” He is unmarried, loves
music and has two cats.

Anderson is very positive
about his Davidson experience so
far. Valuing his own junior year at
St. Olaf in Oxford, he encourages
students to go abroad to widen
their perspective beyond the limits
of a small college. This term he
teaches Philosophy 103 and 105
and will be teaching Humanities
and Social Philosophy in the
winter.

John Savarese

After earning a doctorate in
English literature from Princeton
University and serving as a pro-
fessor of English at Sweet Briar
College, John Savarese switched
fields to become Assistant Direc-
tor of the Computer Services Cen-
ter this year.

“Davidson is an exciting
place,” Savarese said. “I like the
liberal arts background here.
That's where I came from. That's
my background. It’s exciting to
see computers being used imagi-
natively without being an en-
gineering or technical school.
There's a lot that the rest of us can
do with computers. A lot of
people here are computer users,
and there is a lot of growth about
to happen.”

Savarese is a member of the
Presidential Task Force on the Fu-

ture of Computing at Davidson,

which will examine the needs and

infraction of the law, carrying a
$25 fine and $37 court cost. No
points are assigned to your driving
record.

The law allows a lenghty
break-in period of 15 months, so
police officers around the state
will only be giving warning tick-
ets until December 1986. David-
son Police Chief Jack Warlick
noted, “that his department will be

possible uses of computers at
‘Davidson in the near future.
“We're off to a really good start,
and this thing could be big time,”
Savarese said.

Savarese is married to Terry
Scarborough, who was Director
of Admissions at Sweet Briar dur-
ing Savarese’s years as an English
professor there. She is currently
temporarily employed by
Wachovia Bank while taking
courses in hopes of gaining a mas-
ter’s degree.

Savarese said that a great deal
of progress in the field of com-
puters will occur at Davidson
within the next five years.

“In the next five years, I see a
lot more of what | cal! ‘personal
computing.’ I think you’ll see the
computer actually in the work
space. The computer is becoming
a tool that will be at the elbow of
every student and faculty mem-
ber,” Savarese said.

Thirteen schools in the United
States require their, students to
purchase computers. Davidson is
one of a large number of colleges
that encourage, but do not require,
the purchase of computers, ac-
cording to Savarese.

“I don't know if Davidson will
ever require the purchase of com-
puters,” he said. “If I knew that

I'd be very valuable around here. I
think that will become clearer
though as prices come dawn and
people begin to use computers
more heavily,” he added.

Savarese became interested in
computers while writing his dis-
sertation at Princeton. He has also
been on sabbatical at Stanford
University to study computers.

“I have a real interest in the
way computers are used to under-

stand language and the uses of lan-
guage,” Savarese said. “Some call
that ‘artificial intelligence’. While
at Stanford, 1 studied ‘artificial in-
telligence,’ and I have a real inter-
est in that.”

Thrower educates, relates

By JEFF LESESNE
Police officer Ray Thrower
brings seven years of experience
with him as the new Davidson
College crime prevention officer.

Thrower has been in charge of
programs to orient freshmen to-
ward crime prevention. He also
works closely with the RAPE
committee. He said, “my primary
concern is making Davidson Col-
lege as safe as possible.”

Thrower grew up in David-
son, where his grandfather was
the police chief. After becoming
an officer in 1978 he went to work

stopping and warning citizens
during the first enforcement
period”.

Studies show that using seat
belts greatly reduces the chance of
serious injury. They also show
that for every 100 drivers killed
hot wearing safety belts, about 75
would be alive today if they had
wor them. Each year 600 people
in North Carolina die because they

for the Mooresville Police Depart-
ment. He then taught drivers’ edu-
cation for a while, and then he be-
came a patrolman for the town of
Davidson. In March of 1985 he
became an officer for Davidson
College.

Thrower graduated from Cen-
tral Piedmont Community Col-
lege in 1978 with a two-year as-
sociate and applied science degree
in Criminal Justice. He is also a
state certified drivers’ education
teacher and a state certified crime
prevention officer. He also has a
general law enforcement certifi-
cate. He attended bomb procedure

do not wear their seat belts.
Another 5,000 are seriously in-
jured. That is a tremendous loss of
our state's most precious resource
— our people.

There are several common
complaints against wearing safety
helts. A common one is, “I'm af-
raid that my car will catch on fire
and I won't be able to get out.” Or,
“I'm afraid my car will go off into

school and various law enforce-
ment update schools.

Thrower has recently gone
back to school to earn his B.A. in
Criminal Justice. He is presently a
senior at Sacred Heart College in
Belmont, N.C. He explained.
“I'm a student myself. so I under-
stand the things that are going on
around campus. | know all the
problems they [students] have and
I understand their environment.”

Thrower is married and has an
eleven month old girl. When not
studying, he enjoys his computer
and the outdoors.

Up

the water and I will drown.” Cars
rarely catch on fire or go under
water except on TV. The use of a
safety belt is more likely to keep
you conscious so that you can get
out. If you do not wear a safety
belt, there is a good chance you
will be unconscious and unable to
do anything. Some people say
they feel uncomfortable wearing a
safety belt, but a wheelchair is
even less comfortable.
