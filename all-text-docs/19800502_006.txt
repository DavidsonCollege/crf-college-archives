By ANTHONY EVERMAN

Next week, a new restaurant
will be opening in the Davidson
community. La Toque Blanche
will occupy the building vacated
by The Coffee Cup on Depot
Street. The proprietors hope to
invite guest chefs who will cook
their specialties in the restau-
rant. Each chef for the night
will wear “‘the chef's hat,” thus
the restaurant’s name, La To-
que Blanche.

Student art
exhibit awards
presented

By JOSEPHINE STUTTER
Staff Correspondent

This year’s annual student
art exhibition is on display in
Chambers Gallery and runs
until Thursday, May 15th. It
represents a broad and diverse
selection of student artistic
interests during the "79-80 aca-
demic year.

Two factors limited the
choices of Art Professors Herb
Jackson and Russ Warren:
namely, the amount of available
space, which restricted the
number of large canvases that
could be shown in the exhibi-
tion, and the timing of the

exhibition to coincide with Con’ ,

vocation which reduced the
representation of advanced
ing classes.

‘Juror Professor Emeritus
Douglas Houchens gave the
first award to Jeff Burns whose
striking abstract acrylic work of
contrasting vivid colors and
darker blank areas provokes
either an enthusiastic or a non-
committal response. This vigor-
ous painting contrasts with the
subtle pastel coloring and
three dimensional effect of Lisa
Jenkins’ impasto composition
which gained her the second
award. A personal favorite was
the work of the third prize
winner Gifford Piercy whose
evocative etchings had both a
sensitivity and technical accom-
plishment which was distinctive
in an exhibition notable for
individual expression rather
than general proficiency.

Among the few watercolors,
Andrea Lamorte’s abstract
painting of pastel swirls was
generally popular as was Sandy
Fossett’s etching of sunset on
water and Paul Schultz’ scrupu-
lously exact lithographs. Brett
Logan was one of the artists
who received an honorable men-
tion; his eyecatching abstract
work contrasted with his more
representational picture of
swamp water trees ‘painted in
luminous primary colours.

Herb Jackson placed the
emphasis of the exhibiton on
democratic rather than highly
competitive criteria. Its pur-
pose is ‘‘to celebrate the activity

of Davidson students in pain-
ting classes.’’ He stressed the
fact that the exhibition consists
of a judicious selection of the
work not of art majors but of
the first. efforts of other stu-
dents at serious painting.

Owner and operator Bettie
Casey, with the help of her
husband Hugh, hopes to offer a
variety of dining alternatives.
In addition to noon and evening
meals, there will be coffee or
tea with doughnuts and pastries
during the ten o’clock hour.
_The restaurant will offer in-
ternational cuisine. At noon, a
light meal will be served con-
sisting of soup ‘and salad. The

evening meal will be more- -

elaborate with individual dishes
representing various nationali-
ties. But all meals will be served
in the French fashion: a number
of courses, each with small
portions of food.

There will be a fixed price
menu which will be posted in a
box outside the restaurant and
will vary daily. Some nights
simple three course meals will
be served to appeal to student
customers; other nights the
cuisine will be more elaborate.
Hugh Casey will bake pastries

and authentic French bread to
accompany the meals.

There is a small bar which
will offer apertifs and other
drinks. And, an unusual treat
for this area, wine will be
included in the price of the
meal. Customers may be offered
a different wine with each
course.

The restaurant is small so
that only two dozen people will
be served each night. The decor
is simple but pleasant. Bettie
Casey suggested that the atmo-
sphere will be relaxed, ‘‘the
dinner should last well into
evening. People can sit around
and talk much as they do in
restaurants in France.” She has

been “delving into French took- |

ing fox the past twenty years,”
and has studied it in France and
taught a course in Charlotte.

The restaurant will operate
on a reservation only basis.
Customers may call 892-1412
for reservations.
