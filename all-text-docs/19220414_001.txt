The Wildcat Debaters won a close de-

cision over Wake Forest in a contest of!

wits between teams representing the two
colleges, held Friday night at Queens
College, in Charlotte.

Wake Forest upheld the affirmative!

side of the query, “Resolved, That the
Government should own and operate the
coal mines in the United States, consti-
tutionality waived,” while Davidson de-
fended the negative, winning a three to}
two decision. Speakers for Wake Forest
were L. E. Andrews and F, L. Goodrich, |
while E, E. Houghton and J. C. Bailey’
represented Davidson.: M. B. Booe ant
W. A. Gamble were respective alternate
and managers.

Wake
Andrews bringing out that the present)
system is corrupt and should be chang-
ed, and that coal mining is a public util-
iiy and should be handled as such.
Goodrich developed the points that the
government should own, and operate the
imines to conserve coal and to reduce the
price for the consumers.

Houghton
ment ownership is unnecessary. Bailey
proved that government ownership is
impractical and would be harmful.

Dr. W. H. Frazer, president of Queens,

Clarkson, J, A. McRae, Plummer Stew-
art, H. M. Victor and J. M. Matthews
served as judges. The first four are

! nominated men for the offices of presi-
dent, vice-president, secretary and treas-

for nominations from the floor. In ad-
dition to S. M. Davis, R. F. Davidson, H.
1H, Smith, and G. B. Sorrells, Pat Craw- |
\ford and Gig Shepard were nominated |
from the floor, but they withdrew their
|names from the race Each of the men!
|1,ominated by the council were seconded |
land voted upon. S, M. Davis and H. H. |
Smith led with the highest number of |
votes, but neither had a majority. On|
lthe second ballot S. M. Davis was elect-|
ed to lead the student body throughout |
\the coming year. |
' For vice-president the’ council nomi- |
nated Warren Cox, C. M. Davis, Elias |
| Faison, A. M. Hillhouse, A. M. McBryde, |
land Ralph Smith. Each of these men

were seconded: and voted upon. Hill-|
