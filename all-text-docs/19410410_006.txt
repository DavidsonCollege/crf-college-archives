it is the duty of each citizen who |

members of the board will check off

The rest is simple; the votes can be
counted and the name lies securely

an investigation arises.

However, since sentimental com-}
bines are present whether actual |

oral ones are or not, the biggest re-
form at present seems to be that of
secrecy. This is the best suggestion
that I have heard along that line so
far.

However, I think that we should
pull aside our cloak of “clean poli-
tics” and legalize what is actually
going on underneath with the sys-
tem of open politics. Friendships
between fraternities are going to
cause them to vote one way any-
how so why not let them organize
to vote that way? The only objec-
tion which I have heard is that the
best’ men wouldn’t be elected but
I don’t believe that. Since the non-
fraternity vote would decide the
