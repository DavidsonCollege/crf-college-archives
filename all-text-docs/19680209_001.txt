By DICK ANDERSON
Statt Writer

A fire which caused about
$3,000 damage occurred in
Little dormitory Sunday
about 6:30 a.m.

Blake Anderson and Roger
Mercer, the occupants of the
third-floor room, estimated
that they lost at least that
amount in clothing, books.
bedding. a pipe collection,
luggage, a camera and a
typewriter.

Mercer said that he was
jn the room asleep when the
fire started in an overstuffed
chair next to his bed.

Mercer attempted to use a
trash hasket of water to put
out tho fire, but by the time
he had returned from the
bathroom with the water the
fire was too big to be extin-
guished that way.

Bob McKellar, who rooms

that he woke up and tried to

Books
Vanish

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

The Davidson College Li-
brary has lost over $1.300
worth of books.

According to the inventory
taken in June, 1967, 260 books
were missing, of which 15
have been found.

According to a library
spokesman, the number miss-
ing is not significantly great-
er than the number in pre.
vious years. The number of
missing books for the inven-
tory of June. 1966, was 262:
for June, 1965, the number
was 193; and for June, 1964,
the number was 227.

“While $1.300 is not as
great a loss sx some libraries
have reported. and while it
is surprisingly small for a
library on the open-stack sys.
tem. it is a disappointing
loss: for a school which oper-
ates on an honor system.”
the spokesman said.

He went on to point out
that money which could be
spent on acquiring new vol-
umes has to be used to re.
place the missing books.

Since some of the books
cannot be replaced because
they are out of print, the ef-
forts of the library staff to
improve the library are frus-
trated.

get the second-floor fire ex.
tinguisher, He found that the
key on the box did not fit the
lock and the extinguisher
could not be gotten out by
breaking the glass front.

Mercer borrowed a dime
and called the fire depart-
ment, which arrived minutes
later.

Because of smoke. no at-
tempt was made to get to
the third floor fire extin-
guisher.

Bill Watson, president of
the Senior Class. presented
proposals to the Student
punch yesterday urging re-
Visfon” of the college's pro-
visions for fighting dormitory
fires.

Watson. working in con.
junction with Grover C.
Meetze Jr.. director of the
physical plant. said the re-
vision was necessitated by
“trends in dormitory fires,”

Watson's proposals are part
of the continuing debate
over fire-fighting prepared
ness at Davidson. The de.
bate was touched off by the
Sunday morning fire in Little
301.

Meetze was criticized by.
some students for putting ihe
hall fire extinguishers in
locked boxes. ‘‘Of course.
the situation of having to use
any kind of lock is very un-
fortunate.’ Meetze _ said.
**However, when we inspect-
ed them (the extinguishers)
last year, we found that
three-fourths of them were
missing or had been dis-
charged.”

“If we could improve the
situation so that they would-
n't be removed, we could just
hang them on the wall.” he
added.

Watson and E. N. Linker,
campus security officer,
reiterated Meetze's position.

Each hall is supposed to
have two types of fire ex-
tinguishers on the wall, The
larger is a powder extinguish-
er and is in a box with a
padiock and the key to the
lock behind glass on the side
of the box. The other type, a
carbon dioxide model, car be
removed from the box by
breaking the glass in the
front of the box. Both Meetze
and Davidson Fire Chief
George S. Hampton said that
these were the best extin-
guishers available.

However. Hampton said.
“The extinguishers are no
good unless you catch the
fire early.”

Meetze has also set up a
fire rescue squad to pull trap-
ped students out of burning

composed of members of the
Davidson staff and practices
weekly,

“The rescue squad is a
volunteer group. They train
in the use of Scott air packs.
and we have a 60-foot lad
der,’ said Meetze. The air
packs enable men to breathe
in a smoke-filled building.

“The rescue squad is a
good program,.”’ Hampton
said, “They're getting a lot
more equipment. and I'm told
they're really we)! taught.”

“They have over $2,000
worth of equipment.” said
Watson. He added that he felt
the rescue squad ought to
hold demonstrations once a
semester so that the student
body would be aware of them.

College officials have also
received criticism because
there are no automatic alarm
systems in any of the dorms.

“In my opinion, it would

be a good thing if each dorm
had an alarm system,” said
one local fire fighter.
Watson said that the col-
lege had considered putting
a central, automatic alarm
in each dorm but decided
against it since students
could set off false alarms.

“Students cannot behave
jrresponsibly toward a dorm
alarm system and they can
not play pranks with the ex.
tinguishers,”" Watson said.
“They could show responsi-
bility toward fire prevention
by passing the new fire rule
which will-come up in.a cou
ple of weeks.”

“Students are not justified
in just breaking the fire ex
tinguisher boxes malicious
ly.” Linker added,

“We also have a general
alarm system that’s supposed
to go off in case of fire. We
test it every day at 1 p.m.."
Meetze said.

MBC’s Spencer:
Next President?

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Assistant Managing Editor

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer.
president of Mary Baldwin
College and generally con.
sidered one of the leading
candidates for next president
of Davidson, said Wednesday
he had not been contacted by
the trustees’ selection com-
mittee.

If selected, he would re-
place President D. Grier

applied for each position, and
therefore the Student Coun-
cil approved the candidates
and declared them elected.

Ed Embree, a junior from
Durham, assumed the posi-
tion of president of the Col.
lege Union. A member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and a
former managing editor for
THE DAVIDSONIAN, Em-
bree advanced to the position
from his previous position as
vice president of the union.

The council also approved
the election of Charles Cam
eron, another. junior. as chair-
man of the Social Council.
Already a member of the
council and social chairman
for the College Union. he will
begin immediately to coordin-
ate social functions during
the remainder of the. semes-
ter.

Cameron, from Memphis,
Tenn,, is also a member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

Martin. who is_ resigning
dune 30. The ‘surprise resig-
nation was announced to the
faculty Jan. 3.

Spencer also said it would
be “inappropriate for me to
comment” on reports that he
had once been offered a posi.
tion of vice-president for aca-
demic affairs or academic
dean here.

Emphasizing the improprie-
ty of his commenting on any
part of the selection com.
mittee’s work, Spencer said
he had received only the
communicaitons sent to all
members of the Board of
Trustees, He was elected to
the board in 1966.

Spencer, a graduate of Da-
vidson, Class of ‘40. served
as assistant to the president
and dean of students between
1951 and 1957. He then left to
take the presidency of Mary
Baldwin.

As a student at Davidson
Spencer was president of the
student -body, managing edi-
tor of THE DAVIDSONIAN.
and. a member of Omicron
Delta Kappa and. Phi Beta
Kappa.

Bilt Bondurant, assistant to
the president and a student
while Spencer was dean of
students, characterized Spen
cer as ‘extremely popular
with the student body.”

“He was a rigorous and de.
manding professor, but a
very competent one at that,”
Bondurant said.

Spencer received his PhD
in history from Harvard, and
has published two books.

Final Draft Gets

Two-Thirds Vote

By JIM COOLEY
Staff Writer

The student body will vote Wednesday on whether
to accept a new constitution which has been 10 months
in preparation and which will make significant changes

in student government.

Two-thirds of the students voting must approve
the new constitution. This requirement satisfies provi-
sions for revising the old constitution and also meets
ratification procedures outlined in the proposed docu-

ment.

Nod Of Couneil

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

The Student Council gave
unanimous approval to the
proposed Student Government
Association Constitution last
night, after voting Monday
to propose it to the students.

The student vote was set
for Wednesday. Feb. 14. A
two-thirds majority of those
voting will be necessary to
pass the constitution.

Franklin Anderson, secre-
tary of the Constitution Re-
vision Committee, discussed
minor corrections in the fina)
draft with the Council Mon-
day. and Mike Bates, chair
man of the committee. went
over the document in detail
with the Council last night.

Anderson said the new con
stitution would be adopted as
an amendment to the old con-
stitution but contained a pro-
vision abolishing the old con-

More Freshmen Pledge
Fraternities This Year

About 30 more students who
went through rush this year
accepted bids than last year.

At least 230 freshmen ac.
cepted bids on Saturday. The
return of bids culminated a
week of rush, with three
parties nightly on Monday.
Tuesday, Thursday and Fri-
day.

Nine freshmen chose not
to participate in rush; last
year nearly 30 freshmen did
not participate.

Several students were
asked about the significant
increase in freshmen parti-

cipation and the increase in
the number of bids given.

President Gus Cochran said
he felt that because freshmen

chance to make acquain-

Frank Spence. co-rush
chairman of Pi Kappa Alpha,

reiterated the importance of
the less strenuous pre-rush
regulations. He said that he
felt increased interest
stemmed from a serious ef-
fort on the part of the fra-
ternities to re-evaluate their
position at Davidson, which
resulted in the new social
affiliation plan.
