By Jenny Schroeter

The Computer Services Cen-
ter (CSC) sponsored a Software
Honesty Awareness Day in Cham-
bers Lobby on Wednesday, Febru-
ary 9 to educate both Davidson
students and faculty members
about the legal use of computer
software,

The illegal copying of com-
puter software was the main focus
of the event. The CSC showed
individuals how to distinguish be-
tween the three types of software.
The staff also recommended keep-
ing items that could prove owner-
ship of software in case an accusa-
tion of illegally copying software
was brought up.

One-on-one discussions were
held on the importance of reading
the Software License Agreement
that accompanies each computer
program that is purchased. Indi-
viduals learned that most commer-
cial programs allow the purchaser
to load software on to one machine
and to make one copy for backup
purposes. In most cases anything
beyond these two steps is illegal
and punishable with fines up to
$100,000 per infraction.

As a college with public com-
puter labs, Davidson takes on a
tremendous risk. If an individual
is caught illegally copying a com-

puter program (known as software
piracy) both the individual and the
school are liable. The University
of Oregon is all too aware of this
liability after paying $120,000 in
fines for software piracy.

By sponsoring the Software
Honesty Awareness Day, the CSC
is attempting to safeguard
Davidson College in the case thata
software crime occurs. Lydia
Lorenzin, the Coordinator of Aca-
demic Facilities and Services, said,
“We want to take the initiative
before the problem occurs. Many
people illegally copy software out
of ignorance. ” The CSC hopes to
stop this ignorance and make
people aware.

With many software compa-
nies losing money because illegal
copying, local software companies’

strongly supported Davidson’s ef-
forts in educating the campus. Stu-
dents who attended the event were
able to enter a drawing to be eli-
gible to win 1 of 35 software pro-
grams donated by local companies
to show their support for the pro-
gram.

Students were also able to pick
up a copy of SP Audit for Apple
and IBM computer systems. This
program creates an inventory of
the commercial software programs
installed on the computer.

Most of those who attended
the event agreed that they were
able to learn more about the legali-
ties behind copying software. For
those who were not able to attend
and are interested in learning more
about software piracy, information
is available at the CSC. .

College Republicans await rivals

By Mary Laura Moretz

The SGA approved the char-
ter for the College Republicans the
two weeks ago, but the republicans
have no official party rivals on
campus. The College Democrats
have not sought a charter or shown
signs of electing officers.

At their last meeting, the Col-
lege Republicans elected Bill Gul-
lan and Chad Lloyd co-chairs.

The club’s constitution states
their purpose as “to develop politi-
cal skills and leadership abilities
among Republican students as

students being exposed to STDs
through unprotected sex may also

be being exposed to AIDS. The -

staff wants to decrease that risk as
much as possible by having con-
doms available.

Because cabinets are stocked
irregularly, some students hoard
condoms and leave the cabinet
empty for the next person.

Ringle says that the cabinet
supplies are intended for emer-
gency situations only and hopes
that the decrease number of pack-
ets being prepared is a sign that
students are buying their own con-
doms.

Terry insists that the memo
was “trying to get RAs to stock the
cabinets, not trying to imply that

there is anything more scary than

usual out there.”

preparation for future service by
them to the party and the commu-
nity.” They plan for some mem-
bers to attend the state Republican
convention later this month. Cur-
rently, they are working on sched-
uling some speakers as well. Gul-
lan says they will also “help out in
local elections in the fall.”
Among their goals, Gullan
adds, is “to debate the Young
Democrats if they are ever formed.”
The democrats, however, have not
elected officers since last year. Dan
Nechemias, the last active presi-

dent of the College Democrats,
says students have shown low in-
‘terest in meetings over the past
year. As for debates: “Idon’tknow
if we will or not.” They have not
seen a pressing need for a charter,
although Nechemias surmises “we
may get one next year.”

Last year the Democrats re-
ceived a‘ significant amount of
money from the Democratic Na-
tional Committee. Most likely,
Nechemias says, the group will
become more active during the
Congressional races later this year.
