The Davidson College Union Board
is bringing several new recording
artists to Love Auditorium Tuesday
night. The artists are the members of
the Piedmont Chamber Orchestra,
and they have recently made the first
recording ever of 14 small Haydn
Symphonic Works in Winston-Salem.

Comprised of faculty members of
the North Carolina School of the Arts,
they have played from Detroit
through Miami and at the opening of
the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.

The same benign, self-assured air
as that of his sleepy Indian deity
appears in his protrait of the Southern
aristocrat from Williamston N.C. The
parallels manifest themselves repeat-
edly among his works. In one
photograph, the harsh lines of a
church steeple aligns itself in thrust
with a missile, meanwhile, the wide
angle lens distorts their theoretical
trajectories into the intersecting bows
of an arc.

Yes, David Bunn is an intruder. He
breaks in upon the harmonious,
every -thing-in-its-place, travelogue
scenes and alters them into the
unexpected. Leave him a Christmas
Eve slice of fruit cake and a mug of
steaming cocoa. This intruder should
be a guest.

The most notorious of prisoner-of-
war stockades often treated their
inmates better than many children are
being treated in America today.

That was the message visiting
lecturer Ken Wooden brought on
campus this Tuesday when he said,
“Even POW camps have basic regu-
lations. We’d be happy if they
(American juvenile centers) would
follow those.”’

Wooden spoke of documented in-
stances in which children were kept in
solitary confinement, gassed in 8 x 10
rooms, forced to take untested birth
control pills, and injected with urine.

Author of Weeping in the Playtime
of Others and a consultant to the
popular CBS show ‘Sixty Minutes”’
on child abuse, Wooden charged that
the main problem is that three very
different types of youthful offenders
are receiving the same treatment.

Non-violent offenders are treated
just like dangerous delinquents. Sta-
tus offenders also receive the same
deal, even though the violent group
makes up less than ten per cent, said
Wooden.

The so-called ‘“‘Status Offender’ is

the most unjustly treated, often being
imprisoned for running away from
home, truancy, and stubbornness.
The average child is 14 years old,
reads poorly, and is from an unstable
family low on the socio-economic
ladder, according to Wooden.
Juvenile Rehabilitation Centers re-
inforce and encourage criminal activi-

ty in spite of their real purpose, he

explained. Eight out of ten youths in
such centers will return to jail.

“It becomes a macho thing, to see
who commits the heavier crime,”’ said
Wooden.

Child Pornography was the topic of
the evening 900 Room lecture. Wood-
en concentrated on clearing up mis-
taken views of ‘‘Kiddie Porn.”

Most of the exploitation occurs
between men and young boys. Par-

Kids treated worse
than war prisoners

ents are very rarely involved in this
“brown-bag”’ industry. Those con-
victed aré*rarely strangers, but
trusted friends or relatives, Wooden
explained.

Usually they have past criminal
records.

Wooden told stories of how Boy
Scouts and Boys Town leaders have
taken advantage of children during
vulnerable times.

After the first encounter youths are
open to blackmail and locked into
Kiddie Porn.

Wooden even related how a Chicago
newsletter ‘‘Hermes’’ encourages the
timid individual to get involved with
child pornography by becoming more
active in Boy Scouts and other
similair groups.

He identifies ‘‘the politics of poli-
tics’’ and legal loopholes as means by
which the directors of these ‘“‘homes”’
escape. Wooden said that he has been
told many times that ‘‘it is not
glamorous enough to prosecute child
care abusers.”

He accused Congressmen of ‘“‘get-
ting their pound of media flesh”’
through holding three separate hear-
ings of the child abuse problem and
then promptly forgetting the whole
issue.

The National Coalition for Child-
ren’s Justice is taking numerous
steps, according to Wooden, to alert
the public and get action. The group
is now asking Congress to pass a bill
allowing ‘‘the U.S. Justice Depart-
ment to investigate conditions affect-
ing senior citizens and child care.

Work on a national bill of rights for
children has also begun, he said.

Wooden suggrested that individu-
als wanting to ease the child abuse
problem should volunteer for work in
the YMCA, Step-tutor, Big-Brother
and Sister Programs, and other
related organizations.

But the best way to stop child
abuse, he said, is closer to home.

Foreign meals seek authenticity

A dim room filled with Egyptian
music, a belly dancer cavorting
about, tables laden with lamb shish
kebab, and pitta bread with tahina...
A Cairo resturant? No, someplace a
little closer to home. Try the 900
Room for the Union Minorities Com-
mittee’s second international dinner
to be offered Saturday, October 29.

Last year’s ethnic dinners were so
succesful that the Minorities Com-
mittee has decided to continue them.
The Egyptian dinner plans typify the
concern for authenticity. ‘‘We want to
get away from Americanized or
commercialized versions of a coun-
try’s food and culture,’’ said Interna-
tional Dinners Chairman, Emilie Bry-
an.
For example Youssef Abagui and
Omaima Hatem, Egyptian Interna-
tional Students, were consulted in
planning the Egyptian feast. They
planned auc:._...-- ouisieiey shish ke-

babs with pilaf, foul (a bean dish),
pitta bread with tahina (sesame dip),
and baklava. Interspaced with danc-
ing and music are folk stories as well.

‘‘Our approach is an honest and
open one--we want to have fun, learn
a little, and eat a lot,’’‘Said Bryan.
Omaima noted however that to acco-
modate the customs of some rural

bl NM Dea

Egyptian communities the women
must eat seperately after waiting on
the men.

Both Bryan and Hatem praised
Ron Scott of ARA Slater for his
efforts to achieve authenticity. ‘‘Ron
Scott does a beautiful job if following
our recipes. He does all we ask and

are" eo" "0" e"e"e"o"e"e"e"0"e"e"e "07s 67070 7s 07070 07)

always goes a step further with his
imaginative flair.”’

With waiting lists for both dinners
held this year, the cultural events
promise to perpetuate themselves.
Bryan stated, ‘‘The main ‘thing is an
evening in which community, faculty
and students can join in a pleasant
social and cultural event.’’

Art Department gets shoes on straight at last

After two years of standing idle,

the art department’s new silk-screen
machine, the ‘“‘New Artform”’ printer
can now be put to use. Davidson
bought this machine two years ago
because of its many advantages over
their old one. It is designed to print
several colors at oncé, greatly simpli-
ring the overall process.
Unfortunately the operation of the
machine. itself was not so simple. The

faculty of the art department could
not operate the machine, so they
asked Mr. Robert R. Malone, silk-
screen expert, to explain the process
to them. A long-distance attempt
failed, however, to solve the problem.

No further attempt was made
because, Dr. Houchens explains, ‘‘I
really didn’t have time.”’ Because of
the diversity of the courses he
teaches, |he could not focus his
attention on this problem immediate-
ly. This year

expressed a desire to do an indepen-
dent research project using this
“sophisticated piece of equipment.”

The main purpose of the trip was
for Mr. Malone to teach the art
faculty how to operate the machine,
so that they could in turn teach
students. To accomplish this he
actually went through the process of
making some silk-screen nrints.

The process was long and intricate,
spanning several hours. It was not set
up for a particular class, 5
