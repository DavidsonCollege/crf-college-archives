Conference of North Carolina Young
People to be Held Here Next Month

The eighth annual Presbyterian Young
People’s League Conference, will open at
Davidson on June toth and continue
through June 17th. The general curricu-
lum will include: Bible Study, Missions,
Stewardship, A Study of Our Church,
Sunday School Methods and Methods for
Young People’s Societies.

For the past eight years, the League
Conference has met at Davidson; the first
three sessions were open to all the states
in the Southern Presbyterian Church, but
when North Carolina began to enter such
a large delegation it was decided to make
the Davidson Conference a North Caro-
lina Assembly of Young People. Under
the new policy the conference has thrived
for five years and each year the enroll-
ment is growing larger so that it is ex-
pected that the attendance at the 1926
conference will reach the 500 mark.

A Board of Directors composed of
Synod’s Committee and Synodical Aux-
iliary Committee Young People’s
Work has entire charge. of the Presby-
terian Young People’s Conference. The
Soard has secured some of the ablest
speakers in the Presbyterian Church to
teach, speak andycounsel the young peo-
ple for this year.

quota, but Davidson as yet, has one va-
cant place, only four having signified
their intention of staying.

Theatre to Raise Money

The Davidson-Cornelius Post of the
American Legion starts a drive next week
for the purpose of raising funds for dis-
abled veterans of the World War.

The Government has done much
ward alleviating conditions as regards
those men who came out of the war in
practically a helpless condition but cer-

to-

tain phases that are beyond present gov-
ernment jurisdiction are being handled
by the American Legion and the raising
of funds for carving out the work of
the Legion constitutes one of the many
activities of this big order.

In the effort to raise funds in Davidson
and Cornelius direct contributions from
individuals will not solicited. Such
action ordinarily leads to criticism of the
American, Legion on the part of those
solicited and is disadvantageous in other
ways. Instead of this method the Legion
will give two picture shows at the David-
son Theater, matinee and night, and in
this manner give value received for the
amount contributed.

The big war picture, “Flashes of
Action,” has been secured for Tuesday,
May tith. At 3:00 p. m., a special mat-
inee for children will be given, the ad-
mission charge to be fifteen cents: the
night exhibition will be for adults and the
admission Will be twenty-five cents.

Major L. B. Crayton, Commander of
the local post, believes that the bringing
of the picture to Davidson will enable the
Davidson-Cornelius Post to raise its pro
rata share of the disabled soldiers’ fund

an interesting cvening’s entertainment at
a nominal price.

Flashes of Action takes the spectator
through the hard struggles of the in-
fantry during the World War when every
vard of gain had to be paid for with the
lives of men. It shows long lines of ad-
vancing foot troops with here and there
casualties caused by a bursting German
shell or the well directed machine. gun

world,

a naval fight with a hostile submarine,
hand grenade skirmishes, and, in one
case, a road covered with German dead,

Crows

In a ficld in sunny Spain stands a stone mortar.
Crows hover around it, picking up bits of grain and
chaff —cawing.

Here Marcheta, in the fresh beauty of her youth,
will come to pound maize. For years she will pound
maize. The stone will stand up under the blows;
not a dent has the muscle of three generations of
women made upon it. But the crows will hurl their
black gibes upon a woman aging early and ‘bent
with toil. Old Marcheta—still in her thirties.

The American woman does not pound maize. But
she still beats carpet; she still pounds clothes; she
still pumps water. She exhausts her strength in
tasks which electricity can do better, and in half
the time.

The high ideals of a community mean little where
woman is still doomed to’ drudgery. But the mir-
acles which electricity already has performed
indicate but a fraction of the vast possibilities for
better living and the tremendous opportunities
which the future developments in electricity will
hold for the college man and woman.
