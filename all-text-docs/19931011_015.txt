Harriers welcome a

By Jean DeMoss

A Davidson tradition contin-
ued this week when the Davidson
cross-country team hosted the
eighth annual Davidson alumni
race on Saturday.

The cross-country team,
alumni, friends, and professors all
competed. Although a small meet,
runners traveled from as far as
Miami to compete, and many did
not come home empty handed.
Runners competed for high stakes,
tee-shirts were awarded to top fin-
ishers.

The men ran first fielding a
strong pack of twenty four run-
ners. Noother collegiate team com-
peted, thus everyone had the home
course advantage.

With a crop of recent gradu-
ates, there was no pre-race favor-
ite. A light breeze stirred and the
sun beganits ascent when the men’s
tace started at 9:30 a.m.

Hailed from the east to west as
a challenging course, the harriers
attacked Davidson’s hills with a
vigor. Spectators kept up with the
face through radio reports from
volunteers on the course.

John Moss, a 1991 graduate,
led from the start and blitzed to a
27:32 finish, the second fastest
alumni time ever.

Finishing second was team
captain, Junior Eric McMichael in
28:09.

Third place went to David
Kerns, a 1993 graduate, at 28:47.

Fourth place went to 1992
graduate, Ted Richardson, ata time
of 30:10. This was his last race
before heading to Somalia.

Freshman David Foss’ par-
ents, all the way from Connecticut,
cheered him to a fifth place finish
at 30:37.

And Professor Maydole rep-
resented the faculty with a respect-
able sixth place finish. Davidson’s
own, Sterling Martinand Bill Giduz
also continued their jogging tradi-
tions.

The guns went off for the
women’s race at 10:15. The sun
was higher when the fourteen girls
rushed into the woods.

Davidson’s harriers took off
in a pack. In order to finish the 3.1

Soccer ties rival N.C. State for second straight year

Pack continued from page 14

when they drew Andrews out of
goal and unloaded a shot, but
fortunately was deflected by a
Davidson defender. All opportu-
nities produced no goals and the
two reproduced a tie for the second
year in a row.

Davidson showed a great deal
of improvement as they sent many
beautiful crosses throughout the
whole game, and the defense has
become more consistent. It is ob-
vious that the team is getting stron-
ger and stronger asthe squad heads
into the second half of the season
The tie kept the Cat’s record at

5900 with an overall 5-5-1 mark.
Davidson headed back into South-
ern Conference action with a road
trip to Charleston to face the Cita-
del Bulldogs.

The. game versus a lesser op-
ponent gave the Cats a well needed
comfortable victory, and they took
care of business with a 4-0 drub-
bing. Jon Olin led the charge with
his second and third goals of the
season. Scott Ellis and Eric
Sjostrom also added goals to put
the game away. Neal Andrews pre-
served the shutout as the Cats im-
proved their Southern Conference
record to 2-1 and pushed their over-
all record to 6-5-1. Davidson hits

the road for their next five games
before returning home on the 27th
to face Appalachian State.

With eight games remaining,
the Cats have an excellent oppor-

_ tunity to finish the year with nine

straight victories. None of the
games are patsies, but Davidson
matches well against all of these
teams. With only two of these
games played at home, facing these
teams on the road will not make the
situation easier. Still, this stretch
will be important for an NCAA
bid, seeding for the Southern Con-
ference tournament, and confi-
dence for the probable rematch
against Furman University.

mile course alumni and friends
need to run tangents, work the
straightaways, and bear down on
the second mile. Sophomore
Phuong Nguyen continued her
streak and won the women’s race
in 20:45. She was followed by

Marie Grisez 21:14, Katie
McKelvie 21:15, Stephanie Moses
21:32, and Carolyn Meadows
21:40.

While the current cross-coun-
try team dominiated, the alumni
had a strong showing.

UNCC outscrums rugby

By Dack Stackhouse

The Davidson Rugby team
traveled to UNC-Charlotte for a
day of mixed results. After poor
turnout at practice the week be-
fore, the team played well but fell
to UNC-Charlotte. UNCC has al-
ways been a strong team but is not
even ranked due to their recent

‘reinstatement to the Rugby Union

of North Carolina.

The loss is the bad news. The
good news is that the Davidson
team met two very promising can-
didates for the job of coaching

_ them, Both men expressed serious

interest in coming to help develop
the team which has raw talent, but
lacks the leadership of a person
who has played for ten or twenty
years.

In the A game Derek Slayton
stood out as the star of the team,
scoring Davidson’s only first half
try. He snagged a Charlotte pass
and ran sixty ‘meters for the try.
The conversion gave Davidson
seven points. Despite this play and
some otherstandout performances,
UNCC dominated the first half.
The team recharged at half time

and played intensely in the second
half. However, UNCC scored two
tries to Davidson’s one in the sec-
ond half.

Again it was Slayton in the try
zone, running beautifully andrais-
ing Davidson’s score to fourteen.
The B game was played with more
enthusiasm by the Wildcats but
their fatigue was evident. The
UNCC team with many more fresh
players managed their second vic-
tory for the day.

Despite this minor setback, the
team is hopeful about the rest of
the season. All four remaining
games will be home games. The
next match is against Western
Carolina University on October 23
at 1:00 p.m. for Homecoming. The
next weekend the team will host
Wake Forest for Parents’ Week-
end.

WFU is Davidson’s biggest
rivalry, and it promises to be one of
the best matches in the state this
year. In November the Wildcats
host both Guilford College and
Washington and Lee. All matches
are at 1:00 p.m.on the upper IMAC
fields.
