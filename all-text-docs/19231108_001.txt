This seems to be a timely subject and brdad
enough to warrant a good debate.

The preliminaries to choose the two mem-

be held on Wednesday night, November 14th. |

At this time all men trying for a place on
the team will meet and from the number the

three men will be chosen irrespective of the |

side they may uphold and solely upon their
speech. At all previous debate preliminaries
both sides of the question have been sup-
ported, and to make competition keener this
should always be the case.

As this will be a two-man team, greater
work and longer speeches will necessarily be
required of the principals.. However, as is
gustomary, only 12 minutes, to be used for |
both main speech and rejoinder, as each man |
sees fit, will be allowed for the preliminaries.
