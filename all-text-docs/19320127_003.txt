THE SPORTS PARADE

UNGER’S SECOND
EDITION OF GRAP-
PLERS APPEAR FRI.

A thin haze clouds the crystal ball of the
usually keen-sighted old seer and his pro-
phesies concerning the Davidson Wildcats
for the year 1932 are uncertain. He hesi-
tates to foretell what the fates have in
store for them, for twice he has predicted
and twice the turn of events has proven
him a liar. “On you, smarty!” Ole Man Time
has sneered mockingly as the old seer’s pro-
phesies have come to naught.

It seems futile to attempt to peer into the
future and see what the Athletic Council in-
tends to do. The resignation of Coach Younger
came as a distinct surprise to everyone, the ap-
pointment of Coach Tilson naturally following,
There was a general feeling of doubt as to
whether Coach Tex would follow with
Coach Monk, but as the days went by, the
feeling almost disappeared, giving place to one
of satisfaction that Coach Tex would remain
as head coach. Now, shocked by Coach Til-
son’s unexpected resignation, surprised at the
offer given to Mr. Dick and Mr. Newell, won-
dering at their refusal, we would not be sur-
prised at anything. We expect Pop Warner or
Tad Jones to be signed up any day now. Or
perhaps Nicky and Mathews, premier coaches
of the Davidson Midgets, would consider the
job—that is, for a substantial remuneration,

We have been advised that speculations con-
cerning coaching possibilities would not be only
useless, but would incur the displeasure of some
of those in authority. Freedom of the press,
however, and the interests of the student body
compel us to report certain rumors concerning
the appointment of J. D. McCall, former foot-
ball and track star, of the assistant
coaches. These rtimors have not been traced
down as yet, and it is possible that they are
mere idle speculations. Yet they deserve con-
sideration, for McCall might possibly be the
man for the job. He was a brilliant back on
the football varsity for three years at David-
son, captain of the track team his Senior year,
and while having had no experience in basketball
at college, he is well grounded in the essentials
of the game. His record as backfield coach at
Gastonia High School this season was espe-
cially good, his team having lost
game.

as one

only one

With losses to both Furman and Carolina,
the Wildcat quintet seems to have gotten off
to a rather bad start, but we have noticed
it to be a habit of past Wildcat teams to
pick up as the season goes by, so things may
not be so bad as they seem. The Wildcats
have a strong defense, especially when the
man-to-man system is used, and also have
a smart system of handling the ball, but
when it comes to scoring points, they just
don’t seem to be “in there.” There seems
to be right much luck in connection with
shooting goals, but with a little more prac-
tice, a little more daring, and quite a bit
more confidenec, the Wildcats should win
a couple of big games.

What we like to see is a little more of this
Big League stuff. A true big-timer will try to
stretch a single into a double. He takes a
chance. And that should go for basketball as
well. Long’ shots. That!s the ticket.

Though the Freshmen lost their game to
the boys from the Creek, they exhibited a
neat working team. We. should hear some
more nice stories from them ere long.

A certain fact lies festering in our heads for
which we have failed dismally to find any dire
significance. “ft must mean something pretty
startling, but is beyond even our Special Sus-
pectors. The fact is that Bernarr Macfadden
sent out 22,000 Christmas cards.—North Amer-
ican Review.

A married woman teacher is refused em-
ployment in many localities, but no one tries to
drive the charwoman back to her home.—Mrs.
G: J. Cottrell.

Dick’s Refusal Ties Knot in |
Davidson Coaching Situation

|Many Applicants for Coach, but as Yet

None Selected

Failure of Leonard Dick, coach of Wood-
berry Forest School, to accept the offer of the
Davidson Athletic Council of one of the coach-
ing positions now open here threw the entire
set-up which had been practically completed

out of shape, and left the local coaching situa-

ee

The plan called for Dick to coach the back-
field, and be assisted in the line by Bill New-
ton, scout for the University of Tennessee, as-
sociate of Major W. R. Neyland, former coach
at South Carolina, and big league ball player
at Birmingham. With Dick's refusal on hand,
the plan of the Athletic Department to bring
these two men here has been abandoned, and
now Newton of of

tion in a muddle.

has the status one many

When it became known, first, that Tex Til-
son would likewise leave Davidson, and later
that Dick had turned down the place, the office
of Captain Pritchett was immediately besieged
with applications from a number of coaches seek-
ing the place, and by almost as many names
sent in by groupsof*alumni of men whom they
thought fitted for the position.

Rumors have consistently linked several men
with the local position. Included among. these
are Walter Skidmore, highly successful Char-
lotte coach who has been thought of by seme
as a possible successor t6 Younger and ‘Tilson
ever since the resignation of tliesformer. Pat
Crawford, who graduated from Davidson sev-
eral years ago, and who since then has gained
prominence first as coach at Guilford, and now
as a big league ball player, would be welcomed
back by many alumni. However, Crawford's
forte at Davidson was basketball and baseball,
getting only a service letter in football.

could be prevailed upon to abandon that for
the Davidson place.

Sunday's “Charlotte Observer” presented the
name of Jim Weaver, head coach of Oak Ridge,
as a possibility, inferring that he had been in
this vicinity for the purpose of investigating
the Davidson situation. No meation of this has
emanated from the Davidson officials, and it
is not known what the status of this man is.

Bill Fetzer, at William and
Mary, and long ago mentor of Davidson, is

present coach
carrying the weight of a number of alumni ap-
provals behnid him, especially among the older
men, and it is known that he has been serious-
ly considered for the job. He and his brother
Bob, now of Carolina, were coaches here when
Davidson was taking on and beating the cream
of the South, such as Georgia, Georgia Tech,
and other prominent members of the Southern
Conference. It is pointed out that these men
left behind records that have been only closely
approximated since.

A, number of the alumni letter writers have
mentioned names of younger and more recent
stars, both of Davidson and other schools.
Bobby Dodd, Tennessee’s All-American foot-
ball and basketball star of 1930 and 1931, now
on Georgia Tech's staff, comes under this group,
although how seriously he is being thought of
is not known. Former Davidson include
Walter Fraley, last year's captain, and now
coach at Shenandoah Valley Academy; Dick
Grey, one of Davidson's greatest backfield pro-
ducts; Joe McCall, assistant coach at Gastonia ;
some of the Black boys, one of Davidson's
greatest athletic families, and a number of re-
cent stars.

’Cats Defeated 19-8 by

Fast Furman Five

On Monday night, January 11, the Davidsen
College basketbalk team took a severe beating
from the Furman quintet. The game, which was
played on the gym court here, ended with the
visitors leading, 19°to 8.

From. the opening started
rather slow and for the first six or cight min-

whistle things

utes neither team scored. Furman was the first
to score by means of a foul and a little laterg
by a field goal. Holland then threw a foul for
Davidson, followed by another foul by Furman.
A few other shots were attempted by both sides
but none successfully, Thus the end of the first
quarter found the visitors leading,:4 to 1.
During the next period the Purple Hurricane
limited the Wildeats to another one point which
was made when Brown dropped in a foul. Adair
put two field goals through the loop for Fur
man while Smith rung in three Thus
the score remained until the whistle for the half
sounded, leaving the Wildcat quintet outmarled

fouls.

by nine points.

With about thirteen minutes to play, Furman
began freezing the ball and deliberately refused
to shoot on several occasions in order to keep
the ball in their possession. Although the Da-
vidson Wildcats failed to close the breech in
the score during the last half, they did some
beautiful playing and put up a scrappy battle
against the Purple Hurricane of Furman till
the gun ended the game.

Davidson's wrestling season will open Friday

Washington and Lee brings one of its great-
