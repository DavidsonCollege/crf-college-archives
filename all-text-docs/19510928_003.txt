schools.

To the few brave fans and the 300-odd Freshmen, the ef-
{ect of a stunning defeat “‘soaked’’ in last Saturday night on
the campus of Davidson College. Lenoir-Rhyne of the North
State Conference and under the able leadership of Coach Clar-
ence Staasvich fielded a strong eleven and got the jump on the
Cats on the starting kickoff with a brilliant 90-yard TD gallop
by their scatback Robinson and never relinquished their mastery
in the game to trim the Red and Black by a 21-7 score.

To the coaches, players, and all those who had followed
this year's proceedings down in Wildcat Hollow, it was par-
ticularly stunning. This was the year the Wildcats were going to
put a stop to thier losing ways. The material had poured in from
all corners of the South and more. pep and spirit was apparent
from the very first. Coach Little had added to his staff a former
Davidson lineman who had played some great ball for the Cats,
and also one of the Southern Conference's best T quarterbacks
and safety men. The coaches had worked hard and had a lot of
new tricks up their sleeves. The boys had worked even harder
in the hot September sun to polish their defense and attack.

What happened then? Lenoir-Rhyne’s Bears are in a dif-
ferent league from ours. It is a small league of small colleges.
They don’t get the publiciey that the Southera Cunference
schools get nor do their teams. Therefore when one of the
Southern’s schools schedule a North Stater (most of the time
for a breather or an opener). it is logic that they would go all-
out to win the game or put up.a good fight.

And so Staasvich stayed awake nights this summer, drove
his boys to the limit. recruited. worked out plans and plays, and
generally got set to lick Davidson to show that they can play
football up there, too. As the saying goes. ‘They had everything
to gain and nothing to lose."’ The Bears got the kickoff, blocked
viciously. and paved the way for the ball carrier to the Davidson
goal—90 yards away. Their single-wing formation made more

gains during the wet, sloppy minutes of the game than did our,

quick-opening T-formiation.
FROM THIS DAY FORWARD

Although they face a really tough schedule of greatly-
improved teams. the Wildcats cannot and will not be counted
out of the race for victories. Coach Little has the finest staff
any coach could want. The biggest and best bunch of freshman
material in years has descended on the campus, not to speak of
the already-potent crew of starters and lettermen that were left
by graduation and Uncle Sam. The season has just begun and
it can't rain every Saturday (law of distribution, etc.). Those
boys have worked hard and long and they are due some reward.
The Cats have to get in the frame of mind that the Bears had
when. they travel to V.P.I. today.

In picking this year’s captain and alternate captain the football team must have been trying
