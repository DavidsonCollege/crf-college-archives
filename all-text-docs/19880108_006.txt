Spoof o’ the Week

Welcome to 1988! But not just yet....

By BILL SCOUTEN

What about all those news clips
that made 1987 one of the most
scandalous years ever?

“Is the party over?” “After the
crash” “Heading off hard times”
“Up in smoke” “All about twins”
“Cher” “Gorbachev in America”
“Headaches” “Behind the
smiles” “‘Broadcastnews’” “The
80’s are over” -- just a few of the
many headlines which sensation-
alized what I would term: “cor-
rupted consciousness.”

The. crash....America’s “‘whiz
kids” on Wall Street ran for cover
in a shower of ticker tape mad-
ness. Computers worked faster
than the minds controlling them -
-mental mayhem. The Dow Jones
dropped 508 points. And, after six
hours -- of trad-
ing...$500,000,000,000.00. gone.
“Bulls and yuppies became en-
dangered species on Wall Street.”

The Iran/Contra hearings with
_ Oliver North -- good ole Ollie --
upholding American truth and
justice. The buck can only go so
far, then it’s pocketed. What ever
happened with that scandal?

And, what about the new
“Yuppie disease”, Inhibited Sex-
ual Desire? Honest! More people
in the U.S. are losing their sexual
drive, and what do doctors tie it
to? “A deep childhood fear of
abandonment” “Fear of inti-
macy” “Sheer fatigue.” Yet,
women continuc to finance the
publishing world, reading books,

such as: Women Who Love Too

Much, Smart Women, Foolish

Choices, and Men Who Hate
Women and the Women Who Love
Them (ring a bell,
Hutch?!){EDITOR’ S NOTE: That
was a gratuitous and completely
unnecessary reference to Mr.
Hutchinson's spectacularly un-
successful romantic life. Please
ignore it.}. Where do you stand?!

Spuds MacKenzie, Cabbage
Patch Kids, Couch potatoes, and
Madison Avenue. This has been
the year of the advertisement.
And, as usual, the desires of the
public have again proven insa-
tiable. Acid-washed denim jeans,
disposable cameras, laser games
on TV, the “Bag Lady Doll”,
“Motormouth Julie”, and adult
comic books full of sex. What will

_ they offer next?

School getting to you?: Los
Angeles kids must love it....of
course, it was always said that
Californians were a little crazy.
Their school system is operating
full-time now, for the whole year.
One year of school straight -- 12
whole months of education -- can
you believe it? In existerice since
1970, the idea of extended school-
ing has seen its day. ‘“‘‘Anything to
get away from the old agrarian
schedule.’”(?!)

Bruce Springsteen puts out a
new album. Whitesnake: up and
coming. Madonna rises from the
pages of Penthouse to Billboard’s
top. ten.

U2’s_ unforgettable’

Joshua Tree is asummer favorite.
Or, perhaps, Steve Winwood’s
“The High Life.” Don’t forget the
Beastie Boys with “Fight for Your
Right (to Party).”

Animals of 1987? Pitbulls
became the “Jaws” on land. “The
last wild California Condor was
captured after eluding pursuers
for seven months.” The Dusky
Seaside Sparrow is now an extinct
species. A new animal is now
patentable -- a Geep (goat-sheep)!
Surprised?! And, last, but not
least, let’s hear it for the Soviet
monkey in orbit. After freeing his
hand (paw), the monkey tinkered
with the control panel in the cock-
pit, resulting in a landing which
was far off course. Way to go,
Curious George!

Child abuse: an outrage, need I
say more?

Jim Bakker, Tammy Faye
Bakker, and Jessica Hahn. Gary
Hart and Donna Rice. Oliver
North and Fawn Hall. Scandal-
ous. “The Girls of Summer: Three
Who Answered Notoriety’s
Knock.”

The AIDS epidemic, finding its
way into the nooks and crannies of
city streets and homes, terrorizes
young, middle-aged, and oldalike
in its sweep across humanity. The
condom-and-safety-precautions-
leaflet package, referred to as
“safe sex” by the renowned Dr.
Ruth, is distributed right and left

by concerned ‘groups nationwide .

and heralded by the young as a

It’s apretty gruesome picture of
American life, isn’t it?! What’s
wrong with America?

Odgen Nash wrote in his book
of collected verse, /’ma
Stranger Here Myself,

There is only one way to
achieve happiness on this
terrestrial ball,

And that is to have either a clear
conscience, or none at all.

Writing in the 1950s and 1960s,
Nash, I believe, nonetheless had
some important things to say
about the social situation in the
*80s. Composing his verse in the
sterility of the ’50s, Nash puts two
and two together, he cuts through
all the external whiteness of the

~ country. He saw the muck, the

perversion, the immorality. He
saw the factors underlying the
radical moral upheaval of the six-
ties and early seventies.

It seems that the Watergate
hearings were only the tip of the
iceberg. What has America come
to? Has we taken a turn for the
worse?

Travelling at warp speed into

_ the 1990s, we seem unable to look

back for fear of missing what may
be ahead. We concentrate entirely
upon the future, refusing to heed
the countless mistakes of the past.

It is said that a problem cannot
be remedied if'it is not first ac-
knowledged. So itis with Ameri-
can life today.

The American nation mustheed
Nash’s advice: if you can’t keep a
clear conscience, then don’t pre-
tend that you do. What am I sug-
gesting? I am suggesting that
America just cannot cover up
herself adequately.

Publicizing ad nauseum the
many scandalous events in the

Friday, January 8, 1988 THE DAVIDSONIAN

newspapers, on the news broad-
casts, and over the radio waves
amounts to nothing but needless
sensationalism. It just turns the
scandal’s offenders into real ce-
lebrities. Is America really so
proud of its scandalous behavior?
I wonder.

As a new year’s resolution, I
suggest that America turn back to
the past. See the whiteness of its
past. Let’s get back to the sterility
of the fifties. Let’s better cover up
our scandals and bury them deep
in the sands of time.

What a spoof!@#$%&

No doubt, that’s what some

Americans would like tohear. But
that’s just not what America
needs.
- As the horizon of 1989 is
neared, let each of us look closely
at our own lives. See through the
cherubic, erudite mask which
each of us wears. Begin with
yourself.

Recognize the factors in life
which effectively cover up the
conscience which was so clear in
youth. And, as Nash sees through
them in his poetry, successfully
eliminate the insatiable desires,
the wanton lusts, the violent ad-
dictions.

Affect a change and observe it
all year long! Keep the sands of
consciousness clean and white,
undefiled by the slug of the oil
slicks and chemical spills of scan-
dal. “Have a clear conscience, or
none at all.”

So now 1987 is gone...and with
it two of Davidson’s pride.

To the families of Collier Lily
and Thomas Vaccaro, we send our
prayers...on the wings of a year
that has come and gone, a flash in
time. A youthful memory of them
still lingers.

But, the tolling of the bell beck-
ons us on....Onward into 1988..

Good Luck!
