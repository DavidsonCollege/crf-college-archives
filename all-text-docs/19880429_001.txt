Student focuses on
styrofoam hazards

By MUADI MUKENGE

Should Davidson protest the
use of styrofoam products be-
cause of their apparent danger to
the atmosphere? This question has
recently come to the forefront of
campus concern as a result of a
student’s having brought it to the
attention of the college Food
Services.

Mary E. Bagley (aka Shawnee),
ajunior Genter for Special Studies
major, learned of the problem
from a monthly publication of the
South Carolina Piedmont Peace
Resource Center.

According to the article, the
manufacture of styrofoam prod-
ucts involves the use of chlo-
rofluorocarbons (CFCs), sub-
stances which react chemically
with the ozone layer of the atmos-
phere. The ozone contains mole-
cules made up of 3 atoms of oxy-
gen, which are destroyed by the
CFCs. As a result the sun’s ultra-
violet rays, which are carcino-
genic, are able to penetrate the
ozone layer and are therefore a
danger to the human population.

Human beings are not endan-
gered by using styrofoam prod-
uctsas serving vessels; itis only in
the manufacturing: process that
fatal damage occurs.

Dupont Inc., a major manufac-
turer of chlorofluorocarbons, is in

the process of terminating the
process. In addition, McDonald’s
Corporation has stopped using
Styrofoam cups for commercial
sales. The state of Vermont has
banned the use of styrofoam in

- State institutions.

Verner alerted Carl Pritchard,

director of Auxiliary Services, at
the beginning of the 1987-88
winter term in hopes that the col-
lege would terminate the use of
styrofoam products.
’ According to Pritchard, the
decision to do so involves a com-
plicated process which focuses on
the cost of converting to paper
products. Such products are more
expensive than styrofoam be-
cause of the special coating used
to cover the porous surfaces.

It was in that interest that Lean-
dro Tolentino, Dining Services
Purchasing Manager, conducteda
comparative cost analysis of pa-
per versus styrofoam products.
While individual product prices
may differ only by fractions of a
cent, mass purchases of the paper
products are considerably
cheaper. From data listed on the
comparative cost sheet, the fol-

lowing were revealed:

cents per 1000 cups)

Pritchard states that what con-
cerns him the most is “having a
satisfactory product to use for all
purposes.” His priorities are to
consider sanitary aspects, health
concerns (consumers are not hurt
by direct use of the products) and

the ease in handling of the styro-
foam vessels. Styrofoam meets
these needs perfectly, he says.

If any change is to be made in
the school’s practices, Pritchard
continued, it will have to be a
business consideration weighing
several factors.

Food Services currrently pur-
chases styrofoam products from
the following companies: Sweet-
heart, Amoco Products, Dart and
Lily Cups.

Verner pointed out that styro-
foam isnot easily disposable (they
are not biodegradable) and envi-
ronmentalists are faced with the

additional problem of how best to
getrid of styrofoam once it is used
by consumers.

The environmental problem
which CFCs pose should be con-
cern to all, says Verner, adding
that often-the general population
has no such knowledge until con-
cemed individuals disseminate
information.

She proposes further action:
“Students in general should be
encouraged to boycott restaurants
who still use styrofoam, mention-
ing perhaps that a competitor
(McDonald’s) has stopped using
the product for good reason.”

Thieves take $500.00 cash, keys from library over weekend

By GEORGE KURANI

Davidson’s E.H. Little Library was

. robbed of approximately $500 between its
closing time on Saturday, April 23 and its
opening the following day. Although there
were no signs of forced entry, the intruders
managed to make their way into one of the
business offices where they located and
stole a set of keys used to open the desk of
library business manager Mary Wilson,
where the money was located.

Chalmers Davidson, college archivist,
was the first to notice that the library had
been broken into. Upon arriving at the
library on 9:30 Sunday morning, Davidson
noticed that books had been knocked off of
the shelves in the cataloging and acquisi-
tions departments. Since everything had
been in order the previous night at closing

Davidson's first blacks return for

time, he immediately called Leland Park,
director of the library.

Park arrived at the library around 12:30
p.m. But when Davidson, who had been
working in another part of the library, went
back to the scene, he was sure that the
offices had not been in such disarray earlier
that morning. Park feels that Davidson
must have walked in on the thieves while
they were proceeding with their work.
When Davidson left the room, the thieves
supposedly moved additional books.

The police were notified immediately
and soon arrived to conduct an investiga-
tion.

The police were unable, however, to find
any fingerprints. To hide their fingerprints,
the thieves spread oil on all the doorhandles
they touched, as well as on the desk from

Further speculation has it that the distur-
bance of the books and the oil spreading
were just a diversion intended to lead
people to believe that the break-in was less
highly planned that it actually was.

Since there were no signs of a break-in,
speculation has it that the thieves must have
had keys to the library and the offices
inside.

According to Park, they “must have had
a pass key and known exactly where they
were going since they only greased the
doors to the adjoining offices.”

Park said that this is the first such robbery
he. has witnessed in his 21 years at
Davidson.

“Such an incident is very hard to under-
stand,” he said, “and I feel irate that anyone

would commit such a crime.”

“Wecan account for every pass key from
between 6:00 Saturday and 11:00 Sunday,”
he continued.

Park also added that the average number
of years worked by the library staff is over
ten years and that he “trusts all the staff
completely.”

The library iscurrently changing all of its
locks, including those to the copy ma-
chines.

The investigation continues and as of
press time there were no leads. Park
stressed that the library welcomes any and
all suggestions concerning the break-in.

“We live in an interdependant commv- -
nity,” said Park. “We all need to be on the
lookout for each other’s safety and help
solve such problems when they arrive.”
