Gresham RevealsStatements’-

Favoring Liquor On Campus

By JIM COOLEY
Staff Writer

Senior John Gresham, a mem-
ber of the Blue Sky Subcommit-
tee on Student Life, revealed a
number of favorable statements
toward the idea of a wet campus
in a DAVIDSONIAN interview
this week.

Gresham, along with other
members of the subcommittee,
interviewed Assistant Dean of
Students Robert Ward of Am-
herst College and Dean of the
College Leroy Greason of Bow-
doin College several weeks ago.
Gresham also talked by tele.
phone with Assistant Dean of
Students Joseph Wilson of Duke
University.

All three of the institutions
have so-called “‘wet'’ campuses.
The Amherst and Bowdoin cam-
puses have been wet for some
30-40 years, Gresham indicated,
Amherst still retains a rule
against consuming alcoholic
beverages at official college-
sponsored functions.

A new rule permitting con-
sumption of alcohol within dor-
mitories and fraternity houses
went into effect at Duke in the
fall of 1964. The new rule does
not permit drinking in public
buildings or carrying drinks out-
doors on the campus nor does it
allow any drinking at the wom-
en’s campus.

Both Ward and _ Greason
failed to see drinking as an is-
sue. on their campuses. It had
been permitted for such a length
of time that they considered the
situation as “the way things

lems arose, he commented, but
there was ‘‘no real abuse.”

Fresham further pointed out
that both institutions were skirt-
ing state laws which allowed no
drinking until age 21. The two
deans seemed to feel that the
colleges were tacitly encourag-
ing students to drink on campus
by not passing rules against it
to correspond to state regula-
tions.

Both indicated, Gresham relat-
ed, that Davidson had the po-
tential for a much more realis-
tic situation since state laws al-
low consumption of beer and
wine at age 18.

Assistant Dean Wilson was
specifically asked by Gresham
if there had been any noticable
change in student conduct since
the new rule went into effect.

Gresham quoted Wilson’s an-
swer as follows: ‘Yes, very
much so. Student conduct on
campus is 100 per cent or more
improved .. . . this is one of our
happiest rules.”

Wilson further commented that
there have been fewer disturb-
ances and less damage in dormi-
tories because the rules provide
that the seriousness of,an of-
fense be compounded if alcohol
{is involved.

Though Wilson recognized a
little different situation at Da-
vidson, Gresham stated, he was
still quick to point out other ad-
vantages of the wet campus.
Student expenses for parties
were greatly decreased because
there were a lot more on-campus
parties.

as saying.

Drinking Rule Changes:

No Damage

Mrs. Peter Nicholls, supervis-
or of dormitories at Davidson,
was questioned this week as to
whether ‘there had been any in-
crease in damage to the dormi-
tories since abolition of the ‘stu-
dent rule against drinking last
spring. —

“I honestly don’t think so.”
Mrs. Nicholls replied.

There might have been a slight
increase in damage. she later
indicated, but she said that a

the rule and the increase in dam- .
age, if there was any, could not

be made.

She did note, however, that |
there “seems to be less of a '

especially concerned about an
increased amount of burning

Representative Discusses |

Republican Strength In 68

The Honorable R. K. Ingle, a
“member of the North Carolina
House of Representatives. was
the guest speaker at Wednes
day's meeting of the Young Re-
publicans Club.

Ingle is a representative from
Forsyth County, Winston Salem.
North Carolina. His talk center-
ed around two topics; the major
issues that have faced the state
legislature during the past year
and the prospects for the North
Carolina Republican party in the
1968 state elections.

Cited as the chief concerns of
the legislature were education.
the brown-bagging law, and the
East Carolina College problem.
In education. Ingle said the prob
lem is that North Carolina is
facing a shortage of teachers.

He did not view brown-bag-

ging as a partisan issue. Rather,
he saw it as a factor determined
mainly by the nature of local
counties. He thought the ECC
question to be a very difficult
one for any politician to handle.

Looking ahead to 1968, Ingle
foresaw a real opportunity for
the Republican party to make
significant gains on a state-wide
basis. “The Republican party in
North Carolina has a real soli-

darity and is greatly concerned,

about the interests of the state,”
he said.

He expressed the view that the
Democrats have been worried
over the past year and have con-
sequently had to organize under
a majority leader for the first
time in a long while.

Ingle felt that the Republican
party has now become the action

Committee

To Offer Swedish Film

The film “One Summer of
Happiness” will be presented by
the Union Fine Films Commit-
tee next week.

“this is a good film which
ean be enjoyed merely as enter-
tainment although it has more
for those who want it." said
Joe Jones. chairman of the Fine
Films Committee. It will be
shown Thursday at 8:15 p.m.

The Swedish film is a love
story which has won the Grand
Prix of the Cannes Film Festi-
val and Special Award of the
Berlin Film Festival, Jones said.

Speaking cf the films being

planned for the continuance of
the program next fall. Jones
said, “The success and quality
of our program will largely de-
pend on the student interest.”

He explained that five films
will be shown next fall. Tickets
will be available on a season
basis at reduced rate. The ad-
mission for “One Summer" will
be 75 cents.

The program will aim at inter-
national representation in the

Jones. His committee will seek

as artistic merit.

the Democrats have become the
reactionists.

He observed that during the
past year Republicans have fre-
quently introduced bills that
have been killed in one way or
the other by the Democrats.

The ideas in these bills. noted
Ingle, have subsequently been
picked up by the Democrats and
reintroduced in their own bills,
many of which have been pass-
ed. Thus. he said, the Democrats
seem to be reacting to Republi-
can initiative,

According to Ingle, Republi-:
cans are really going to have to
“do their homework’ because
of the strong opposition offered
by the Democratic party.

art lovers got the opportunity to
buy “good art cheap and bad

College Union.

The art auction was one event
in the Fine Arts Festival held
here last weekend.

Herb Jackson, a senior fine
arts major, termed the event a
great success. It certainly was
for Jackson. in any event, for
he made more money than any
of the other artists whose works
were auctioned.

According to Jackson. a large

sold. The highest price paid
went for Ken Autry’s ‘Three in
