WAS CLASS PRESIDENT

Powell to Guide Yearlings Until
Spring Elections

In the final ballot taken last week
the Freshman class elected E. L. Pow-
ell its Senior Counselor and Adviser.

Several years ago an amendment to
the constitution forbade the Freshman
class electing its officers. It has been
the custom, then, for the last three
years to elect some outstanding senior
to act as adviser to the first-year men.
The class of ’35 elected Sam Wiley as
its adviser. Last year, owing to a va-
cancy, the president of the student
body, Jerome Clarke, presided over the
class.

Powell was the last president of a
Freshman class. Since that time he
has been a leader not only of his class
but of the campus as a whole. Powell
is cadet captain of Company A of the
local R. O. T. C. unit and a member
of Omicron Delta Kappa, of Scabbard
and Blade, national honorary military
fraternity, manager of the Student
Store, a member of the “Y” Cabinet
in charge of freshman work, and a
member of Gamma Sigma Epsilon,
chemistry fraternity,

Nominations for candidates were
made at a meeting of the Freshman
class week before last, the ballots be-
ing run off last week. The first bal-
lot had nine nominees: E. L. Powell,
J. W. Lafferty, C. M. Rives, Boggs
Corbin, Mack Holland, A. B. McLain,
Lanier Pratt, Alex Schenck, Eb Will-
son, of which all but the first three
were eliminated. The second ballot re-

ber of banquets to take place in Char-
lotte between the dances have also
been planned by various fraternities.

A figure in which members of the
Pan-Hellenic Council and presidents of
fraternities will participate’ is to be
held Friday night. Those of the coun-

Mr. Jackson Speaks

Talks on Tendencies in Modern
American Education

At the meeting of the Gastonia Ki-
wanis Club held last Tuesday, Mr. F,
L. Jackson, treasurer of Davidson Col-
lege, gave a brief talk on the ten-
dencies in modern American education.

Mr. Jackson brought out the fact
that there are three matters of train-
ing which are now receiving the spe-
cial attention of educators and educa-
tional institutions. They are: training
in government, physical education, and
the proper use of leisure time.

Recently we have been brought to
the realization that we need to give
our young men better training for gov-
ernment positions, a fact that England
has long considered one of the most
important in educational methods.

In addition to Mr. Jackson’s talk, a
musica™program was given by the
quartet of the Davidson College Glee
Club, accompanied at the piano by
Mr. J. C. Pfohl, director of music at
Davidson. The quartet, consisting of
D. P. McLain, F. H. Morris, J. C. Rob-
inson, and F. A. Tucker, sang a medley,
entitled “Street Urchin,” and. also
“Short’nin’ Bread,” while McLain sang
two “The Three Grena-
diers,” and “Asleep in the Deep.”

given last Thursday, was on the skele-
ton system. The subjects of the re-
maining lectures are as follows: the
circulatory system, the digestive sys-
tem, the muscular system, the nervous
system, and the reproductive system.

Wade Ison, Sports Editor, to Set-
tle Much-Argued Question
by Ballot

STUDENTS MAY VOTE

Mackorell Placed in Dr. Oren
Moore’s Selection

During the past week, a contest has
been conducted by Wade Ison, sports
editor of the Charlotte News, in his
column “Isonglass” in an attempt to
select an All-Time Davidson Football
Team.

The contest was occasioned by the
fact that Dr. Oren Moore, an ardent
Davidson alumnus, who had previously
picked All-Time Davidson team,
shifted his line-up somewhat by plac-
ing Johnny Mackorell in the place of
Everett to Mackorell’s
sparkling play during the past season.
Other outstanding players on Dr.
Moore's team were Sayad and Wooley
Gray, both guards. »

This selection naturally occasioned
quite a bit of interest among Davidson
fans; accordingly, Wade Ison proposed
his plan in order to decide this matter
once and for all. Now, in order to
secure a wider range of opinion, he has
asked the assistance of the Davidson
students in making this selection, since
naturally they are interested.
of this, a ballot with spaces for. the
players’ names may be found on the
sport page of this issue of The David-
sonian, .Any student who wishes to
enter his choice may fill out this ballot,
sign it, and send it tothe sports de-
partment of the Charlotte News.

Dall players, which the student may

The remedies for the incorrect fune-

be used in distinguished
speakers, from time to time, to deliver
at the college courses of lectures in
defense of Christianity against current

Speaks on Different Business
Systems in America

The beginning of the end of the cap
italistic and individualistic systems of
business in America was seen in 1933,
Prof. John P. Williams, professor of
business administration at Davidson
College, declared today in an address
at the Civitan at the

Chamber of Commerce.

America as a nation was founded on
the individual, who in a business way
start what he liked,
make money and spend it as he chose
and this has been the spirit of the
history of this country, the speaker
said,

But since March 4, there has been
a change and today the federal gov
ernment is in control, Professor Wil-
liams continued, pointing to examples
of this control as the subsidy of the
farmer, the NRA for industry, and the
plan of paying at least an existence
wage for labor.

“Who of us March 4, as we
listened to the President's inaugural
address, would have thought that the
NRA and |General Johnson would be
playing the part they do today? There
is one question that now arises, what
will happen, not in the next six months,
not in the next two years, but prob-
ably in the next five or ten years, if
a political party would wield the prin-
ciple of the NRA for its own pur-
poses?” the speaker asserted.

For the future this country may ex-
pect that the admonition of caring for
the poor, as well as realizing that the
poor “ye have always with you” shall
be carried out, he continued. Also, he
said, the future will show that the fed-
eral government will have an ever-
present part in the conduct of busi-

on

ness and industry.
