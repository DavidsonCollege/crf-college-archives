‘91-92 Directory:

By Meredith Boone

With the recent publication of
the Davidson Directory, students
were both overjoyed and _be-
fuddled. Everyone, especially the
Union desk workers, was glad to
finally have the directories on hand.

However, many students ex-
pressed confusion at the directory’s
cover design which depicts an old-
fashioned telephone with the
mysterious words “Twin Oaks 2-
2000” stretched above it.

Among students, theories as to
the significance of the design var-
ied. Many wondered if the cover
was meant to parody “Twin Peaks,”
David Lynch’s recently cancelled
television creation. Others assumed
that the “ Twin Oaks” referred to
the plethora of oak trees on
Davidson campus.

Mike Van Hecke, Director of

Publications and designer of the
directory cover, cleared up the
confusion. Twin Oaks was the
Davidson/Comelius phone ex-
change during the 1930’s and ‘40’s.
Since the "TW’ of Twin corre-
sponds to the 8 and 9 of what we
now call a phone prefix, thé num-
ber on the directory cover is actu-
ally the old number for the
Davidson switchboard.

Welcome But Confusing

design for the directory, Van Hecke
explained that the “Minneapolis
look,” design evoking the post-
World War II era, was the “new
big trend in advertising, possibly
in reaction to the Middle East
Conflict.”

In spite of the bewildering
nature of this year’s directory
cover, student response has been
generally positive. One student
called the cover “Really cool. Much
more sophisticated than last
year’s.”

In contrast, editorials lam-
basted last year’s directory cover,
which depicted a red “Catatonic
90” phone with eyes, arms, and a
mouth, playing novelty answering
machine messages. Much of the
protest stemmed from student be-
lief that the directory was unrepre-
sentative of the Davidson student
body.

Van Hecke felt that a “sim-
pler” design was called for, after
the reaction to the “Answering
Machine cover.” His main goal is
to create a directory which “stands

out on a desk. The Answering

Machine cover blended in too well.
This year’s design jumps out at
