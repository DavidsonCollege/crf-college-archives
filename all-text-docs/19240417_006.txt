DAVIDSON DEBATERS DOWN
EMORY STARS

to-use whatever measure she deemed neces-
sary within the limits of reason. He then
proceeded to prove the point that the causes
underlying the occupation justifies France.
He gave statistics showing Germany's de-
fault, asserting that Germany had disavowed
all laws, and that France, left alone, needed
this privilege. “There was no other means
to assure herself of collections,” he stated.
“France did het best first, and then, because
she needed the money, she resorted to this
action, the reparations commission authoriz-
ing it.”

“The results of France’s occupation of the
Ruhr does not justify her, for it has been
inexpedient and unprofitable,” said M. Rose
in opening his argument. He looked at the

* question from a commercial point of view,

declaring that the conditions are worse today
because of France’s occupation. Germany
could not pay, he said, except by turning over

-her securities and her marks, and the latter

were worthless. He argued that Germany
would have paid in time, He challenged the
affirmative to show that France had made a
profit, and concluded by saying that all that
France had obtained by her occupation could
have been attained without her invasion.

Warren Cox, the last speaker for David-
son, did not wait for rebuttal, but refuted
the statement that Germany cannot pay by
reading the headlines of the New York
Times, of Thursday, in which it was stated
that “experts declare Germany able to pay,”
and “Germany’s resources are ample.” This
was occasioned by the report of the Dawes’
Expert Commission to the Reparations Com-
mission. He asserted that German's only
debt is the reparations debt, since worthless
marks have destroyed other obligations. He
reviewed the industrial conditions of Ger-
many, and noted the evasiveness of this coun-
try.

The last speaker of the negative, H. M.
Bullock, proved that equity and wisdom does
not justify the invasion. He said that it,was
morally wrong, politically unsound, and that
it was a violation of the sanctity of treaties.
He also touched upon the commercial view-
point, stating that France was not bankrupt
and did not need the money, and that even
now a 40 per cent tax is made on all goods
going from the Ruhr to Germany and no tax
upon those going into France. “It is morally
wrong,” he said, “because it is a step toward
militarism; it is politically unsound because
it provokes future wars, since Germany was
bound to retaliate, and, lastly, it destroyed
the sanctity of treaties, because the provisions
of the Versailles Treaty and the Covenant of
the League of Nations have been violated.”

The rebuttal showed Davidson’s superior
strength. Paul Story mixed wit with sound
and logical facts, and both Elkins and Cox
put across their refutations in a noteworthy
manner. It was here that the debate was
cinched and even the consensus of opinion of
the audience was that Davidson had added
another victory to her string of intercollegi-
ate debating wins,

Approximately 50 Davidson students were
at the debate, and at its conclusion, the de-
baters, judges, Davidson men and other
guests were tendered a reception by the
Queens College student body.

There died recently in Paris the man

Eumenean Literary Society last Thursday
night, A. C. Wildman and T. C. Barr won.
They defended the negative of the bill, Re-
solved, That the duties of paid coaches in
American colleges should be limited to mass
athletics. N. G. Patterson, A. M. Moffett
and W. H. Lynch spoke on the affirmative.
McLane, the reviewer, recommended all the
speakers for credit. W. A. Christian was
reinstated into membership of the society.
President Smith announced the regular elec-

Pandeinic

L. M. McCutchen, secretary; L. B. Gibbs,
treasurer; C. M. S. McIlwaine, first critic;

In the regular debate J. E. Moore, sup-
porting the Whigs (affirmative side), won
over S. W. Moore, representing the Tories,
who were supporting the negative.

GLEE CLUB TO WARBLE

the occasions and the jaz orchestra has done
its share to keep things livened up. The
fact that the organization carries both a
symphony and a jaz zorchestra attracts many
who prefer oné to the other.

This program by the Glee Club will be next
to the last that they will give this year, the
last being at Concord, where they will make
music for the musical festival to be held
in that city. This is indeed an opportunity
to hear the premier songbird and jazz hound

Track Teams of State
Enter Raleigh Meet

State and Carolina Loom as Strong-
est Contenders Among Carolina
Teams

The state track mect for this year will be |

held at Raleigh on the 2nd and 3rd of May.
Formerly this meet has been one of the
biggest things in the college athletics of the
state and the one this year promises to sur-
pass all on record. Every college in North
Carolina will be represented, Lenoir and
Guilford joining Davidson, Carolina, State,
Trinity and Elon, who alone have made up
the previous meets. Each college will be
allowed to enter as many men as they see
fit. Coach Monk states that probably five
men will be sent from Davidson, only those
who seem likely to win points being selected.
However, there is still time for men to show
their ability in the dual mets coming before
May 2nd and if anyone does show enough he
will also make the trip.

In the last three all-state meets the Wild
cats have come off with their share of the
honors. In the meet three years ago at
Chapel Hill, with Leonard Dick as captain,
the team won 23 points, Knight taking first
place in the shot put. State won the mect.

The next year at Durham the meet, which
Carolina won, was held in connection with
the Olympic games. Here Gracey tied for
first place in the pole vault, Knight won first
in the shot put and Koenig won first place in
his dash. Gold medals were given for first
places, silver for second, and bronze for
third, and the Wildcats brought back their
share, &

Last year at Chapel Hill, Carolina won
the meet, State coming in second and David-
son third. Gracey took first place in the
high hurdles, CaJhoun in the high jump and
Streibich and Captain Gallaway second place
in the pole valut and 880, respectively.

DAVIDSON HONOR MAN

an incident in which the Buddhist priests
were found to have entrapped women and led
them into an underground prison, when the
women had come to their shrines to worship.
“This is what the past has had for China.”

“At present the student movements are the
ruling influences in China. The real power
of China is in the hands of the students, the
young men and young women in the schools
of the nation. In 1919 the influence of the
college students caused the overthrow of the

government of that time:

“The New Thought Movement is also a
great influence in the China of today. The
idea of these advocates of New Thought is
to simplifythe written language. They
want to make the written language similar
to the spoken language, and they are intro-
ducing a new written language which is bet-
ter than the old forms of writing and yet is
much simpler and more easily learned than
the older forms. This has resulted in put-
ting the Bible on a pedestal, in making the
Bible more widely read, and is producing a
good effect upon the nation. But the great-
est good that has been accomplished by the
New Thought Movement has been the rul-
ing out of old customs.

“The greatest movement in China today is
the Christian movement. This movement is
exerted through three channels—educational,
medical, and evangelistic missions.”

Mr. McLaughlin spoke of the great ad-
vancement of the cause of Christ that had
come about through the influence of the
Christian hospitals in his province. He
spoke of the hospitals which not only saved
the lives of Chinese patients, but also through
their influence saved the lives of missionaries
in saving them from the fury of mobs.

In speaking of the educational missions,
the missionary said the need of China was
for a Davidson in that country. They have
the Yale and Harvard of China, but their
need is for a Davidson in China.

The evangelistic work he spoke of as the
main work, the work that will bring China
to Christ.

Looking into the future, the speaker said
that China was facing a great need of lead-
ership. She is at the cross-roads and must
be won for Christ or she will be won for
the Devil. China is facing the Christian re-
ligion as never before.

C. V. Brown led the singing, Wallace
Purdy was pianist. Mr. J. P. Williams in-
troduced the speaker of the eevning.

He—“And how’s my girl today?”
She. Centhusiastically)—“Just fine!”

R..O. T. C. News

C. A. (Crown) Young will appear before
the examining board at Fort Bragg, N. C.,
on April 14th, to stand examination for a
commission as second lieutenant in the regu-
lar army. He now holds a commission in
the O. R. C., having been commissioned a
| second lieutenant upon the completion of
| the R. O. T. C. course here last year.

Young comes originally from Bellmeade,
N. J. He goes up for examination well
qualified for the office unto which he aspires
and with the good wishes of the entire unit.

Major Ford has been asked if he desires
a 45-day tour of duty with the summer camps
this summer, with the pay of a second lieu-
tenant. This is a new policy and is inau-
gurated for the purpose of rewarding those
men who have done most for the unit during
their four years’ enrollment.

This speaks well for the high standard of
work Ford has done. It has been said that
he has not only maintained the pace set by
Majors Hunt, Rogers, Phillips and Cooper
the past four years, but has succeéded in
bringing the unit through the best year it
has had as regards discipline and morale.

The Juniors and Sophomores who attend
camp this summer’ are taking a “refresher
course” in rifle marksmanship under Cap-
tain Weems. We still have the cup, won last
summer, by the Davidson representatives.
Captain Weems is anxious for this year's
squad to be well prepared for any comers.

The department will announce the third
member of the commissioned staff within
the next two weeks.

Next year’s Seniors have been authorized
$30 with which to purchase uniforms. It is
thought that it will be possible to get the
English collar instead of the regulation col-
lar now worn. One of the objects of the
new system is to make it possible for all
men to have neat appearing, snappy uniforms,
and it is the hope of the unit commander
that the men will take advantage of the op-
portunity to improve the appearance of the
battalion. Selection will be made and meas-
urements, taken before commencement.

Major Hearn says that “B” Company is to
be congratulated on their fine spirit; as they

proved on Wednesday, the 9th, that they are
immune to drowning if given half a chance.
Company “B” is getting in shape to put up
a hard fight for the “Honor Flag.” They
have been successful in the company com-
petition for two years and a hard fight is
looked forward to when the meet comes off
this year,
