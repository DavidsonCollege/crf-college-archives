Human Manifesto

“Some form of compliance with the
Supreme Court's order to desegregate the
publie schools seems inevitable in most
Seutherh states—perhaps in all.”“—N. Y.
Times, March 13, 1956.

“A chang in the written law cannot

erase a traditional culture.”—Charlotte
Observer.

The word segregation brings intellec-
tual nausea to some, spiritual inspiration
to others, and lethargic silence from
still others. Much has been written, much
discussed, much spoken, much thought
on this timely topic—too much. and yet
this makes just one more. Upon perusing
the voluminous files contained in any
library, it becomes evident that there
are only two sides to the question—and
yet how many closed minds have been
induced by just these voluminous files
and the situations which caused them to
be written. Where in the annals of re-
cently recorded history do you find em-
phasis upon human understanding? No
one has the whole solution, though many
have tried. Regardless of the attempted
solutions, however, the emphasis should
be placed upon intellectual empathy.
tempering ideals and principles to ac-
cord with circumstances and the people
which must receive the application of
these principles.

The extremes on both sides have
produced violence, terror, human de-
gredation, and sorrow. Their actions have
bound progress and drastically reduced
all hopes and powers of amelioration.
From the clicking typewriter in the
Bronx editorial.office to the white veran-
da surrounded by Southern marshes, vi-
vid statements have clashed, locking
closed minds and barring slightly open
doors. The Lucy case and the Cole case
are but tragic examples.

The solutions, whatever they may be,
lie not with atmospheric principles or
archaic rationalizations, but with the law
and the people. The law is general, be-
ing adaptable to the situation and the
constituents of that situation. We cannot
deny or refute the law: we can only
adapt it to the surrounding circum-
stances. What is right for New York may
not necessarily be right for Alabama.
Further, what is proper in North Caro-
lina may not coincide with what. is
needed in Mississippi. The Southerner
must seek to understand the purpose and
power behind the law and the intentions
of those who support it. The Northerner
must seek to understand the life, culture,
and people of the South. We are dealing
with personalities—let us act accord-
ingly.

Recent objective surveys have re-
vealed that many areas of the South are
making progress toward equitable adjust-
ment. This should continue and there are
indications that it shall, but only within
natural and acceptable courses. The
South does not need emotional eruptions,
foreign instigators, or radical revolts; it
needs intellectual understanding and
time. The pages of history are full of
horrible mistakes: life and time are too
valuable for us to begin another chap-
ter of protracted errors. Let the heart
temper the mind and understanding pre-
vail.

Observing . . .

As we reash the final presentation
of academic evaluations by department
chairmen several observations emerge.
One, the faculty is not as dormant as in-
dicated by student supposition and ex-
terior criticism. As evident in the printed
comments, many of the departments are
actively evaluating their curriculum, their
needs, and their deficiencies. Many have
acted upon these evaluations, forming
new courses, burying archaic ones, and
modernizing present ones. These merit
student appreciation and encouragement,

~for we are the direct beneficiaries of such
activity. To the larger departments who
have not turned over in recent years, your
fallacies are self-evident, and you as well
as the students are the losers.

Second, many departments are in need
of expansion in curriculum, staff, and
facilities. In several of these cases the
demand is drastically apparent and im-
mediate. These needs as expressed by
faculty and student evaluations should be
met and met effectively before due con-
sideration is given to expansion of enroll-
ment.

Third. interest and concern in the
courses pursued should continue. Such in-
teractive stimulus between student and
faculty is healthy for and vital to the de-
velopment and final graduation of the
man of tomorrow.

Possible Panaceas

To list the needs of Davidson would
require more time and space than pres-
ently available. But these are three sub-
jects for improvement not mentioned re-
cently.

Re-organization and redefinition of re-
quired courses. It has been suggested
that all courses be grouped into cate-
gories according to their nature and sub-
ject matter. Students would then be re-
quired to chose one course from each
category. these being the required
courses for graduation. The program if
adopted would develop the whole man
and would produce a_ graduate ac-
quainted with each general phase of a
liberal arts education. Senior regrets and
present requirement deficiencies and
over-emphasis strongly urge such a pro-
gram.

Instigation of a journalism course into
the curriculum. Although unnoticed.
there are several Davidson gentlemen
planning to enter journalism as a career.
For the possible ‘majors.” for all asso-
ciated with publications, and for alf in-

terested such a course would be profit-.

able.

Renovation of the area across from
the former Village green. This would
include complete: demolition of that vel-
low monster and erection of a suitable
edifice for the promulgation.of finer arts.
Shearer Hall has the appearance of an-
cient ruins without their glory. Sagging
stucco, drafty cells. constipated key-
boards. and bare floors cry out for re-
lief—so do we.

As the Ink Dries . . .

The typewriter ribbon has grown
thin, the mind dry, and the feet. tired.
Yet this is not the time nor the place
for psychosomatic complaints or sym-
pathic apologies. Perhaps the most pro-
fitable contribution to the new editor
would be a brief paragraphic descrip-
tion of what will surround him.

The challenge he has accepted will
require some 15-20 hours a week and
involves: organizing the news and edi-
torial structure, reading exchange
papers, letters, pamphlets, tracts, and re-
leases not filed elsewhere, actively par-
ticipating in the collection and prepa-
ration of all material, and palpitating
with the panting press. He will face the
unprinted page with empty hands, com-
pose news and articles on the spot,
sharpen his own pencils, and sometimes
draw his own pictures. He will keep his
nose to all available keyholes, argue for
ideas, and seek to determine opinion.
He will be up to his ankles in ink and
bowed to his knees by grammerians,
critics, and intellectuals. He will vainly
Strive to find capable and_ interested
writers. He will sweat circulation, seek
advertisers, and endeavor to placate a
confused public. He will receive few com-
ments from anyone—and sometimes be
glad he didn’t. He will be your new edi-
tor. Give him your understanding sup-
port—that is the least you can do.

efforts have made the paper possible.

IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS

Individual is Keystone

Each college student has spent
nearly one-third of his normal life
in the pursuit of education. Mil-
lions of dollars have been invested
in this endeavor by the state, the
church. the college, and loved
ones. Time. effort, and thought
have made the endeavor possible.
Now these are gone—what have
we. got to show for them?

This is a question which each
student must. answer, not once,
but many times during his life.
What have you received from
education? There is no definitive
rating scale by which to judge
the educational process or its re-
sults. However, a recent car-pool
discussion produced the following
points for consideration which,
though not conclusive, present
the situation in a rather objective
light especially when focused on
the Davidson scene.

KNOWLEDGE,
UNDERSTANDING, THOUGHT
Education has three generat
aims: to provoke thought, to pro-
mote understanding. and to pre-
sent. knowledge. Obviously the

three are: inter-related. and must
develop concurrently, but they
differ in relative worth. Knowl.

edge is necessary. Information
gained from cducation has prac.
tieal value in earning a tiving
and esthetic value. in enjoying the
knowledge of acquisition. Every-
one who attends classes inevitably
obtains some information, though
perhaps not intentionally. But
pure knowledge without. under.
standing is dead in valfie and
potentially | dangerous. Under.
standing of the situation, the cir-
cumstances, and the people is
vital to education. Many. mistakes
are made. below the level of un
derstanding for far too many indli-
viduals. are content with the level
of knowledge alone.

Perhaps foremost in this  con-
comitant process is thought. Based
on knowledge. broadened by un-
derstanding. thought is the least
employed yet the most needed ele-
ment of the educational . process.
It includes. evaluating of informa-
tion. directing understanding, and
projecting conclusions on the pres-
ent and into the future. Those who
climb to this level are the chosen
few, chosen by individual desire
and tragically few in number.

THE COURSE

Having loosely disposed of the
philosophical concepts and elusive
generalities, we can further in-
spect more specific elements in-
volved .in education. Three come
prominently to mind—the course,
the professor. and the individual
student. Courses are subject to
change and should be annually
evaluated. Some in our present
curriculum are in drastic need of
revision. The cobwebs that shroud
these presentations are an epitaph
to the course as. well as the in-
structor.

THE PROF

The professor often makes the
course. Many alumni sitting in
careful reflection, remember only
the professor and his gems of wis-
dom. Many of the undeeided are

influenced toward their vocation, .

many obtain lasting impressions of
the field of study. many receive
their philosophy of. life from the
man who occupies: the raised chair.
This places a great responsibility
upon the professor—a_ responsi-
bility which is unfortunately shun-
ned by some. Lack of enthusiasm
for vocation and field, sclf-inter-
est, and misplaced ability are
brutal criticisms which are leveled
at some in the teaching faculty.

The prof who demands beauti-
fully bound reproduction of his
class comments is a condemnation
of the true spirit of education. He
imparts some knowledge, little
understanding, and provokes no
thought. In some institutions in-
structors have been dispelled for
teaching “unsound” doctrine: the
same yardstick should apply to
those who teach no doctrine at all.
Student efforts have pressed for
more seminar-type presentations.
These courses should be initiated
wherever possible especially at the
Junior and Senior level. - They
should heavily emphasize outside
reading, book’ and research re-
ports, with class time devoted to

penetrating discussion—a rubbing
of the minds—on the more im-
portant aspects of the text and
related subjects. Such a course
would cut minor tests to a mini-
mum, allowing certain) academic
treedoms. Now in extremely large
classes and in some particular
courses, this is impractical and
virtually impossible. The mind can
still be stimulated in these classes
through lecture, prubing assign-
ments, intelligent tests, and the
personal magnetism of the profes-
sor,

The professor must further have
an understanding of his students.
He should determine as near as
possible the tevel of information
and intelligence which his class
as a whole presents at the begin-
ning of the course. He should then
gear his instruction accordingly.
Some institutions give tests at the
beginning of a course for the sole
purpose of determining the levels
of a class. The professor should
also understand the circumstances
under which his students are work-
ing. For example, a test given dur-
ing a dance weekend class or im-
mediately before a long holiday
period can never obtain the maxi-
mum from students while it often
destroys positive attitudes. There
is a common meeting point on
such matters and this should be
songht and understood by instruc-
tor as well as student.

THE STUDENT
The individual is by far the
most important ingredient in the

educational fermentation. Good
material and inspirational lectures

‘without student initiative are as

chemical compositions without a
catalyst. The too common approach
to a subject—‘What will he ask
—or what can I get by with?’’ is
evidence of individual lethargy
and unhealthy orientation. The in-
dividual who pursues knowledge,
understanding, and thought
through honest application and ef-
fort finds his reward lasting. The
question then becomes not ‘What
have I received from education,”
but ‘What have I given to cduca-
tion?” The question is personal
and the answer must be personal.
What sort of investment have you
made?

Education is a process which
should develop the whole man.
When it only produces IBM ma-
chines or youthful elephants it
should either be disposed of or
changed. Although other elements

‘are important the emphasis should

be upon thought while the final
responsibility for its growth or de-
cline rests with the individual.
Robert Hutchins phrased the situ-
ation when he said: “We do not
know what education could do for
us, because we have never tried
it.” —RHM

THE UNEXPECTED (S always
to be expected in the game of
politics, but the sudden rise of
Kefauver’s star, coupled with the
decline of Stevenson’s, has caused
more than the usual lifting of eye-
brows among those who follow
the progress of the primaries.

Kefauver's sweep of the Minne-
sota primary, where there was
every reason to
believe that Ste-
venson would
win easily,
placed an_ en-
tirely new light
on the race for

Military Alternatives

(The following is the first
of two installments designed
to outline and summarize
militery service prospects as
they face college graduates or
undergraduates. Ed.)

From our beginnigg as a
nation, we have believed in keep-
ing our regular Armed Forces as
small as possible. Yet it is also a
traditional belief that every able-
bodied male citizen will be ready
to fight alongside these forces in
time of national danger.

For many years, little was done
to insure that these citizen-soldiers
would. actually be ready and our
unpreparedness has resulted in
many unnecessary casualties.
Gradually. however, Congress has
taken steps to translate these tra-
ditions into laws, thereby insur-
ing readiness. The most recent
of these is the Reserve Forces
Act of 1955 which sets forth defi-
nite military obligations and a
variety of ways to fulfill them.

The number and type programs
are, of course, relative to the
branch of Service you choose.
Others are offered that are not
provided for under this specific
Act. We shall, therefore, be con-
cerned primarily with its appli-
cation to the Army; bearing in

mind that similar obligations
and laws apply to other branches.
ARMY

The Army offers six choices
which might be of interest to us
as college students or graduates.

Choice No. 1—Enlist in the
Army for a period of three, four,
or more years.

A man electing this choice in-
curs a six-year military service
obligation and is available from
age 17 till the time he receives
notice to report for induction.
After three years of active duty

he will be required to remain in
Ready Reserve for two years and
Standby Reserve for one. For each
additional year spent in Active
Duty the Ready Reserve time is
correspondingly reduced.

As a Private he would receive
a base pay of $78 and benefits
such as free medical care, $10,000
worth of free life insurance, tra-
vel pay, and moving expenses. In
addition, if living off base, a
Quarters Allowance of up to
$51.30, an Allowance for subsist-
ence of $47.88, and Extra Pay if
in hazardous duty, per month.
After four months his base pay
would increase to $83.20; this and
Quarters Allowance continue to
tise with the accumulation of
years in service and promotion.

Choice No. 2—Enlist, prior to
induction, in the Army Reserve
for six years, to serve two years
on active duty, three in Ready
Reserve, and one in Standby Re.
serve,

Our present Army policy re-
quires that individuals enlisting
in this program be called to active
duty within 120 days after en-
listment. As a Ready Reservist
you would be required to attend
48 scheduled drills per year, re-
ceiving a full days pay correspon-
ding to rank and service for each
drill.

Choice No. 3—Wait for induc-
tion, thus assuming a six-year
military obligation beginning on
date inducted.

Choice Neo. 4—Enlist prior to
age 18% in a unit of the Army
Reserve for a period of eight
years with the understanding that
either immediately or > shortly
after such enlistment you will be
called to active duty for training
(ADT) for six months. During this

son, it definitely did not place
Kefauver in top position. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee still has a
long way to go.

The road to the nomination is
so rough, in fact, that Kefauver
may not make it in spite of his
strenuous efforts. The 1952 con.
vention is a clear indication of the
advantage of the candidate who
has control of the party machin.
ery. Kefauver ran up a respectable
total in the primaries that year
and had a large public following,
but he was bypassed by the party
leaders who felt that he was not a
strong candidate.

HE WILL FACE the same prob-
lem this year, unless he can show
such strength that it would be
impossible to refuse him the nomi-
nation. Eisenhower was able to
win in spite of the Taft machinery
at the Republican convention in
1952, but only because he had un-
mistakable strength.

Kefauver at the present time

Outlined

period of training you will be
paid at a rate of $50 a month and
upon completion § thereof you
will be deferred from draft as
long as participation in Ready Re.
serve for 742, years is satisfactory.

Choice No. 5—Enlist prior to
18% in a unit of the National
Guard and be deferred from draft
as long as service in said is satis.
factory, upon attaining age 28 you
would no longer be liable for in-
duction. Volunteering for six
months ADT can reduce obliga-
tion from 9%-11 years to eight.

Choice No. 6—Graduates of an
ROTC program are divided into
two divisions: those needed, and
those not needed for active duty.
The latter will receive two years
active, three years Ready Reserve,
and one year Standby. The
former, after six months ADT,
will spend 7% years in Ready Re.
serve.

As an advanced ROTC student
you will be payed 90c a day; if
a commission is grantéd you will
receive a Second Lieutenant's
pay of $3242.16 a year if unmar-
ried, or $4268.16 with dependents,
while on active duty.

Although the ROTC program
and West Point are the Army’s
main source of juinor officers,
there is an Officers Candidate
School available to all qualified
men completing Basie Training.
While in OCS the candidate would
be payed $122.30 a month. Also
available to deserving applicants
are advanced or post-graduate
educational programs, both Mili-
tary and non-Military.

ROTC graduates or other com-
missioned personal may apply for
admission to the Army Aviation
School; upon completing this train-
ing they would be qualified to fly
Army aircraft.

does not have such strength with-
in the Democratic party. Stevenson
is still the choice of the party
leaders, but he may not be able
to maintain this support if he
continues to lose heavily in the
primaries. Should the party lead-
ers turn away from Stevenson,
this will not mean that Kefauver
will be their choice. There is no
death of possible candidates.
Stuart Symington might be a can-
didate who would satisfy both
wings of the party.

If the convention should nomi-
nate a candidate who is not ac
ceptable to the South, there is a
strong possibility that a third
party would be formed. Kefauyer
would not be its nominee, for
ironically enough, the only South-
erner who has much possibility
of getting votes outside the South
is not acceptable to the South. Ke-
fauver's refusal to sign the South-
ern manifesto makes him a marked
man in Southern politics. His only
hope for the presidency lies in the
tegular Democratic party.

KEFAUVER HAS MANY politi-
cal virtues that will probably help
him in the months that lie ahead.
He is a natural campaigner in the
sense that Stevenson is not. His
Crockett-type headdress and simi-
lar devices capture the public
fancy, which likes log cabins, ci-
der, and the candidate who is
“just one of us.” Whatever it
does for his dignity, his style of
campaigning will gain him votes.
Stevenson, on the other hand, is
handicapped because of his dis-
like of these methods of getting
votes. Although his position as an
“egghead” would be an asset if
he were in the White House, it
does not help him get there, The
common man does not trust him
as he does Kefauver.

The Democratic convention will
have a difficult time selecting any
candidate to run against Eisen-
hower. By nominating Lyndon
Johnson, the Democrats would
lose their argument about Eisen-
hower's health. Symington also
has health difficulties. The nomi-
nation of Harriman or Williams
would almost guarantee a revolt
of the Southern bloc, and Kefau-
ver might himself be repugnant
enough to touch off such a revolt.

'T NOW APPEARS very un.
likely that the convention will se-
lect Kefauver, regardless of his
showing in the primaries that are
still to be held. He must break
down strong resistance within the.
party leadership, and if he cue-
ceeds in this feat, he w-'l still
have to convince the Sou. that
he is, after all, a Southerne: like
them. Success in both en.teavors
is very unlikely. By yl..g.ng
away consistently, Kefauver may
build up an organization which
will give him the nominaticn at
some later time. But 1956 is not
his year. The primaries a-e im-
portant, but the convention is the
final examination, and the au-s-
tions are loaded against him.
