Men's Hoops Tops Miami of the Big East,
Falls to UNC-Wilmington at Belk Arena

By Chris Hood

When Davidson and UNC
Wilmington left the court at
halftime Monday evening, Wild-
cat supporters had to be feeling
fairly confident about the coming
half’s prospects. Jason. Zimmer-
man’s three-point bomb with three
seconds left in the first half pushed

The} the ‘Cats ahead 38-37. Further-

more, Davidson was at home and
coming off two close victories, the
more recent being a66-62 triumph
over Miami (F1.) two nights ear-
lier.

Much to. the dismay of the
Wildcat faithful, however,
Davidson could only muster seven
points in the first 11. minutes of the
second half. Though the Seahawks
were also unable to mount an.im-
pressive offensive charge, they

tage from Janko Narat, who fin-
ished with a career-high-tying 23
points, and defeated Davidson 71-
68 to leave the “Cats at 7-10 head-
ing into Saturday’s match against
UNC Charlotte.

The two squads matched. up
quite evenly. in the first half, as
neither was ever more than four
points ahead, Zimmerman pro-
vided the primary offensive thrust
for the “Cats, tallying all of his 13
points in the opening stanza. J.D.
Heuer added eight points, includ-
ing two three-pointers.,

At the break, each school had

. made 15 of 31 attempts from the

field; both also had sunk four three-
point shots. The difference was at
the free-throw line, where the ‘Cats
outscored the Seahawks 4-3.
Head Coach Bob McKillop
outlined Davidson’s second-half
strategy rather simply: “We felt
we had to come out and give them
the knockout punch right away.”
Instead, Davidson began the
second half lethargically, scoring
only twice from the field in the first
11 minutes. Ron Horton and Narat
both scored in the paint to cut the
deficit to 52-49 with 8:08 left, but
two minutes later the Seahawks’
Keith Adkins'was allowed an easy

‘layup, and Davidson was behind -

57-50.

The remainder of the contest
saw the ‘Cats struggling to catch
up with the visitors. A Narat three-

» pointer narrowed the gap to 59-57

with just under four minutes left,
and a Frank Harris layup after a
steal left Davidson trailing only

Against Miami two nightsear-
lier, Davidson fans left Belk Arena
in more jovial spirits. Harris
knocked down five of six free
throws in the final minute, includ-
ing two with four seconds remain-
ing, to seal the victory. “I’m the
point guard, and when it’s crunch
time I want the ball to be in my
hands,” he stated.

The ‘Cats began swiftly, en-
joying first-half leads of ‘eight
points on two separate occasions
in jumping out toa 16-8 advantage
in the first nine minutes of play. A
pair of three-pointers from Zim-
merman paced the early Davidson
attack.

Five minutes later the contest
was even at 20, and the two squads
battled back and forth before a Jim

After giving up the first five
points of the second half, the ‘Cats

13:12 remaining.

Davidson regained the lead,

series of impressive drives and
clutch free throws.

Harris’ 15 points led the ‘Cats,
while Zimmerman added 14 (in-
cluding four three-pointers) and
Narat contributed 12. The victory
marked Davidson’s first conquest
of Miami and first triumph over a

the team pumped up. Fierro was
tied 1-1 after the seven minute
