GLEE CLUB PLANS
SEVERAL CHANGES

Club to be Slightly Larger Than
Usual

The Glee Club met last Monday night
for the first practice since the Christmas
Holidays, and at this time some eight
or ten men were present to try out for
several places in the club which are now
No
from the men at the meeting, however.
The club will be slightly larger this

open, definite choices were made

spring than it was*in the Fall and it is

expected that it will show up on_ its
trip this Spring better than on the trip

during the Fall.

The schedule for the first trip to be
made thié Spring has not been completed.
The club has been definitely booked for
concerts at Lincolnton and at Converse
College on March the 15th and: 16th,
respectively, and several other places will
probably be booked for concerts to come

on the same trip.

Professor Cullum stated that one or
more new would be learned for
the Spring trip, the club practicing twice
a week until then. He plans to reor-
ganize the quartet and has several new
songs which he plans for the quartet
to use in the concerts this spring.

Changes are being made in the pro-

songs

gram, and, although the details have
not -been made known, Professor Cul-
lum announces that there will be a

hig feature, quite novel and distinctive
on the program of the club this Spring.

MON. MICHENOT TO
MAKE TALK HERE

Will be on His Second Lecture
Tour of America

The local chapter of the Cercle Fran-
cais, which was organized last year by
the professors of French and_ students
talented in French here in the college,
with the co-operation of the faculty com-
mittee on lectures will bring to David-
son on February 11th, Monsieur Daniel
Michenot. Monsieur Michenot is a lec-
turer of the Alliance Francais, with
which the Davidson chapter is connected.

The local chapter is bringing Mon-

sieur Michenot here for the pleasure
of those interested in French and to se-
cure more interest in French by more

students in the school. Lsat year a very
interesting talk was made to those in-
terested in French by a Frenchman se-
cured by the faculty committee on lec-
tures and the Cercle Francais.

This will be Monsieur Michenot’s sec-
ond lecture tour of America, his first be-
ing two years ago when he lectured to
many groups over the country. Monsieur
Michenot is one of the outstanding schol-
ars brought to America this year by the
Alliance Francaise. He studied in Paris
and was named Professor of Diction at
the Conservatory of Lausanne, Switzer-
land Where he remained intil the out-
break of the World War. At the out-
break of the war he entered the service
of his country as a private. He was in all
the campaigns of his regiment and saw
52 months of service, and was discharged
as a captain. After he was discharged,
he was immediately called to the Con-
servatory of Strassbourg where he faced
a very difficult task He not only had
to teach; but also had the job of or-
ganizing the instruction in Alsace of
French Literature and dramatics. As
President of the Groupt d’art Social he
carried the masterpieces of French dram-
atic art to the smallest towns of the
restored territory.

Monsieur Michenot has in his career
made several successful lecturing tours
in Switzerland, Belgium, Luxemburg,
Holland and Canada.

On these different trips and especially
the trip to America two years ago, Mon-
sieur Michenot has made a name for him-
self as a scholar and a lecturer, The
Cercle Francais is bringing M. Michenot
on account of his reputation as an inter-
esting lecturer. His lecture is expected
to be very interesting, especially to those
taking French.

Monsieur Michenot is expected to lec-
ture in French on the following topic:
Un Romantique Moderne; Edmond Ros-
tand.

Junior Speaking

Junior Speaking will be
changed from March 16th to
March 23rd. The reason is that
the orchestra and Glee Club will
make a frip to Cunverse College
on the former date. On Friday
night, March 22nd, there will be
an entertainment in Charlotte.
Saturday afternon the State
High School track meet will be

; held at Davidson, after which the

“ Junior Class will act as host to
the rest of the student body. The
type of entertainment is withheld
by officials at present. In the
evening they will stage a produc-
tion jn the form of a play.

and so it is with any man whose philos-

There were four elements to consecra-

Christ. Paul realized that the best any
man can give is himself and that. there-

teaching that Christ is the source of our
life not original with Paul; Christ
taught it when he said, “I am come that
