A Dream Realized

From the Davidson Soccer Media Guide ,
September, 1992:

“On May 8, when it was announced that Davidson
College would be hosting the 1992 NCAA Divi-
sion I Men’s Soccer Championshipships, the ath-
letic department started buzzing with one particu-
lar question: With the most experienced soccer
team in Davidson history taking the field this fall,
what are the chances of the Wildcats playing in
socccer’s “Final Four” on their home turf? Well,
since the ‘Cats have never made the 28-team
tournament field and have never finished higher
than 21st in the national polls, a spot among this
season’s top four would be stretching it.”

From the Charlotte Observer,
November 30, 1992:

“Tt was a day in which teamwork counted more
than talent, and doing things the hard way paid off
more handsomely than being the hometown fa-
vorite.”

“Davidson’s soccer team marched onto N.C.
State’s Method Road soccer field Sunday after-
noon and emerged, more than two hours and two
overtimes later, the improbable 1-0 victor, bound
for the NCAA soccer championship final four.”

You gotta believe.

Letters

Bennett Questions Athletic
Department's Basketball Emphasis

To the Editor,

Recently Terry Holland
wrote a letter tothe Davidson
alumni concerning the bas-
ketball team. He reported
that in order to keep the bas-
ketball program at the divi-
sion one level at least 2000
season tickets must be sold.
So far fans have only pur-
chased 200 or so tickets this
year. He wanted to know
what would make the pur-
chase of season tickets at-
tractive to alumni.

The firstthing troubling
me about this article were
the words “athletics at
Davidson” and “basketball
team” being used synony-
mously. There are twenty
intercollegiate teams at
Davidson, eleven men’s and
ten women’s, basketball be-
ing only one of them. «

Secondly, any alumni
knows that with theconstruc-
tion of Belk Arena that there
isno such thing as a sold out
basketball game. Back in
the days of Johnston Gym a

seat was hard to come by
and therefore a season ticket
was valuable. Although our
facility is state of the art for
play, the huge space takes
away from the old spirit
found in the wood walls of
Johnston Gym.

The third trouble spot
was the statement that per-
haps Davidson should move
to division three competi-
tion in light of the amount of
money needed to fund such
a program. This could be
terribly unfair to the teams
already having proven their
ability to compete at the di-
vision one level. And, if it
costs so much to run a divi-
sion one basketball team,
maybe the players could live
without the plethora of para-
phernalia they acquire every
season.

Minutes after reading
the letter, I trampled two
identical basketball guides
(one for me and one for my
roommate since I never see
her I guess) at my door and

found an ad in the Charlotte
Observer for season tickets
to Davidson Basketball.
More wasted money as far
as I-can see. Any student
knows thatour school colors
are red and black and ap-
proximately what the enroll-
ment is without attending an
athletic event. The ad in the
Observer reminded me of a
story I heard about a season
ticket selling campaign
where not one season ticket
was sold.

What was Terry Hol-
land brought here to do, pro-
mote basketball or directath-
letics? The suggestion that I
make to him and his staff is
promote the successful ath-
letic teams and carry that.
spirit into Belk Arena in-
stead of forcing the basket-
ball program down our
throats.

Sincerely,
Jill Bennett °94

Ps veces

To the Editor,

“As c6-Capiain of the
varsity diving team, I was
distressed by the lack of cov-
erage of our first meet ver-
sus Virginia Tech in Octo-
ber. Since then, The
Davidsonian covered that
meet and the Howard meet:
in the space of a fiew obvi-
ously pathetic paragraphs.
This is the second year of
our varsity status, and with
all of the recent hype about
Davidson sports, particularly
soccer, one would think that
all sports would be consid-
ered valued enough to print

time.
I’minthe library not

in the college newspaper.
The Davidsonian editors
feel, however, that the var-
sity swimming and
divingteams are not. So far
this year, the varsity swim-

ming and diving teams have

had four meets, and only two

have been poorly covered. ‘

As asenior, an ahtlete, anda
hard-working Davidson stu-
dent, I share with my team-
mates in feeling betrayed and
belittled by the lack of re-
spect we have been given by
the paper. If no reporter can
cover the meets please tell
me and I will make sure an

slouched in the chair on the

article is written. [believe it
is not my job to hound The
Davidsonian. Thisis whatit
has come to, though.

The sports editor has a
job to do. I believe under his
title, he i obliged to cover all
sports. It has angered me,
my coaches, and all of my

_ teammates. Wepractice five

days a week, represent

_ Davidson in sporting events,
~ and then gounnoticed by the

college voice, The
Davidsonian: Thope my let-
ter will not go unnoticed as
well.

Can't You See I'm Studying?

Thisarticleisawasteof ping. Then you have the balcony, feet propped on

footrest, crick-in-neck spe-
cial. There’s the hunched

doing my work.

Instead, I’m think-
ing of the top ten favorite
pastimes of students in
the library (besides study-
ing, of course.)

Here goes:

1. There’s nail bit-
ing/finger picking. Of-
ten accompanied by its
friend, finger watching.
It’s a sad state of affairs
when your fingernails are
more interesting than the
book you’re reading.

2. Sleeping. There’s
a plethora of styles and
techniques. There’s sit-
ting in the carrel, head on

hand, trying-to-look-

_ over forward, head in
book drooling. And the
boldest: . sprawled out
between the rows,
crashed, making carpet
patterns on your cheek.

3. Staring out the win-
dow. Whichusually leads
to the above. Either that,
or you realize how sad it
is you’re trapped in the
library on a nice day and
go outside and play in the
leaves.

4, Laps. Goto the bath-
room; geta drink. Swing
