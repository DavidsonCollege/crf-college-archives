ALL-AMERICANS
QUOHE VICTORY

King and Knorr Lead Wildcats
In 27-0 Win over Moores-
ville All-Stars

Spurred on by the spasmodic shouts of
a few half-frozen but loyal supporters,
the All-Americans routed the
ville All-Stars by a score of 27-0, last
Saturday afternoon. Coach Flake Laird
used nearly every member of his Wild-
cat B squad at some time during the

Moores-

game,

The All-Stars kicked off and the All-
\mericans got off to some nice gains
in the first few plays. But they soon be-
van to play a ragged game, so that they
were not able to score’in the first quar-
ter. However, with Chubby King and
Kenn Knorr leading the attack, the All-
\mericans did manage to keep far ahead
of their opponents in number of yards
gained,

In the second quarter the All-Ameri-
cans started what looked like a steady
march to the goal line. They did get as
far as the goal line; but, on the play
that should have taken them over, Sad-
ler fumbled. Mooresville recovered, but
behind their goal line. Davidson got 2
points for thay safety, and Mooresville
kicked off from“their 20 yard line. The
‘Cats returned the “ball into the All-
Stars’ territory. Then; after a few
pointed drives, Knorr swept around end
for a touchdown. The try for extra point
failed. There was no more scoring in
that half.

Early iff the third quarter the All-
Americans completed a pass to the
Mooresville 20, Chubby King made 5
more on a line play. Then Knorr received
a lateral and went around end for an-
other touchdown, This time Knorr kicked
the extra point, bringing the $score to
15-0, favoring the ’Cats.

From the Mooresville 25 yard line in
the fourth quarter, Knorr went to the
10 one of the “Unger
Spreads,” frequently used to good advan-
tage by the All-Americans. On the next
play he slipped through the line for the
touchdown, His placement was low.

Toward the end 6f the last quarter,
the All-Stars completed a pass which
brought them down to the Davidson 10.
\fter slight gains on line bucks, they
tried a pass which was promptly inter-
cepted by “Chubby” King who ran about
70 yards to the Mooresville 22, After two
line plays, King traversed his own left
end for the touchdown, Extra point
failed. The All-Stars exhibited a burst
energy the last
play but failed to score.

This season the playing of the “Pros”
has been dominated largely by the work
of Charlie Brown, “Chubby” King, Mau-
rige Peabody, Johnny Sadler,
Matthis, Hill, George
Tom Thurston, and Alex Brown.

KITCHIN HEADS DEACS

Both Teams Fight To Avoid Big
Five Cellar Position

The Davidson Wildcats in their final
game of the 1935 season, will clash with
the. Wake Forest Deacons in the annual
Turkey Day classic.

Both teams are in top physical and
mental condition for the tilt and this
number of the series will be unusually
closely contested not only because of the
traditional rivalry between the Presby-
terians and the Deacons, but also ‘it will
determine which of the two teams will
conclude their football season in the cel-
lar position of the Big Five.

Coach Jim Weavtr's- team does not
have an outstanding record for the cur-
rent season, winning only two games in
the entire season, ‘They eked out a 7-6
victory over George Washington late in
October. In the next game, they trounced
the Blue Stockings Presbyterian
College by the score of 18-0. In spite of
the comparatively poor of the
Deacons, they will be tighting every inch
of the way for sixty minutes to stay out
of the Big Five’s cellar. The Deacons
will also be looking for revenge for the
13-12 licking the Wildcats handed them
last ‘hank$giving and also will be striv-
ing hard to get their third victory of the
season. 4

The Deacons haven't looked so good

from

record

this season because of the opposition they
have been up against. Their main foes
were North Carolina State, Duke, North
Carolina, George Washington, and Miami
University. They have been particularly
dangerous all season with their deadly
pass attack, with Walton Kitchin doing
the heaving and Dallas Morris on the
receiving end. Edens has also proved
himself to be ‘a fine pass receiver in the
last three games, Daniels a crashing full-
back, will be playing his final game for
the Baptists on Thursday, as will several
others on the Deac squad. The most im-
portant losses that the Deacons will meet
will the loss of Kitchin, Daniels,
Shore, Swan and Captain Reinhardt.
Kitchin furnishes the spearhead for the
Deae attack along with Daniel and Mor-
ris. Shore, the Deac right end has been
an invaluable pass receiver while Wag-
ner and Swan have been two of the hard-
est charging..tackles~in-the—state:

The Wildcats will be gunning for their
fourth victory to bring them out with
a percentage better than .500. The ’Cats
won against Elon, South Carolina, and
Virginia; were tied by the Citadel and
the University of Virginia. The State
Wolfpack beat the ’Cats as did the Duke
Blue Devils and North Carolina.
