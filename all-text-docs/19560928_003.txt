Constructive Pledge Period a Must

Down at Fraternity Court, October is
a month of disenchantment for everyone
involved.

The starry-eyed pledge, fresh from the
glitter of Rush Week, finds that life down
at the house isn't quite as he had pictured
it. The punch bowl and its accessories
have been stored for the season.

On the other hand, the fraternity man
is waking to his perennial realization that
all of his brand-new princes aren’t’exactly
the finished products he had imagined,
and that a considerable bit of polishing
will be necessary.

As pledge programs get under way now,
each fraternity would do well to take a
long look at its projected “cold winter.”

It cannot be stressed too greatly that
the fraternity has assumed a sobering
measure of responsibility for the boys
who compose its pledge class. The future
of. each will be greatly influenced by fra-
ternity, and therefore the paramount im-
portance of a constructive program is ob-
vious.

First of all, a fraternity owes the pledge
its friendship. It must be made plain that
above and transcending all else, the fra-
ternity has a sincere and genuine interest
in him and his career at Davidson.

With this comradeship as a backdrop,
each fraternity must let its freshmen
know what it expects academically. Many

The Union Comes

Davidson’s old gymnasium went by the
boards and the beautiful structure now
known as the College Union was crected
in the school year of 1952-53.

Without a great deal of enthusiasm, it
was accepted as the house of the Y. the
publications, the stud, et al, The previous
conditions under which these areas were
met, if not luxurious, had served the pur-
pose adequately and the need for such
extravagance was often questioned.

This attitude of placid submission pre-
vailed until it was torn assunder by loud
cries of anguish when the administration
pronounced its edict that all freshmen
would spend the first semester eating
in the cafeteria located therein.

Frantic fraternities regarded this as the
death blow to the fraternal organizations
at Davidson. How else could the brothers
get to know their pledges? By what other
means could a truly integrated group
grow here except around the dinner
table?

At about the same time, it became
known that there was a full time director
for the Union on campus. In their anxiety
this smacked ominously of a conspiracy
by the “powers that be" to further an-
athematize individual social organizations.
It appeared to be aimed directly at the pro-
vinces henceforth reserved for fraterni-
ties.

Four years later these fears seem rather
hasty and ill-founded. Under the capable
leadership of Shaw Smith, the Union has
assumed the status it once despaired of
attaining, that of a unifying factor on the
campus.

Far from supplanting anything else, it
has supplied a common ground on which
all extra-curricular activities can meet.
Rather than attempting to dominate these
areas, it has served as a coordinator. The
functions it orginated were generally long
neglected needs.

Maturity has not been an easy develop-
ment for the Union. Laughter and scorn
often greeted its attempts to grow. Dis-
interest quickly scotched many opportuni-
ties at service. Criticism, both merited and
unmerited, abounded.

The fact remains that despite this op-
position and discouraging setbacks, the
Union has assumed a position of great im-
‘portance to our campus.

Now it not only stands but it “is”. This

of them are only now coming to the reali-
zation that study is a serious business. Six-
weeks’ grades coming up will emphasize
the fact to those still unconvinced. Tutor-
ing by upperclassmen in classroom weak-
nesses has helped many a frosh to make
the grade.

Freshmen should be stimulated through
pledge training to enter into the extra-
curricular life of the campus, for herein
lies another vital part of the well-rounded
education offered here. Often latent
talents go untapped for the lack of a little
prodding.

Pledge programs have become increas-
ingly temperate in the past few years.
Sweeping reforms have marked the system
even within the experience of the present
senior class, as tradition after tradition
has gone by the board. This transition has
been hotly debated on both sides, but that
is not the point now. The fact is that pub-
lic opinion and pressure, focused on the
local situation chiefly by the faculty, has
unequivocally demanded these changes.

But these reforms have not completely
satisfied those who are keeping a watch-
ful eye on Fraternity Court. The pressure
is still on. Constructive handling of the
new pledge crop will serve as a powerful
argument, should we have to argue again.
And we undoubtedly will.

of Age

has been done without sacrificing its
philosophy of existence, i. e. that the
Union is an assisting unit only.

Opposition has died almost completely.
The Union is ready to begin to serve Da-
vidson in a more profound way. Work
has begun on a constitution and a Board
of Directors will be established, with both
student and faculty representatives.
Greater quality and wider variety in pres-
entation wil! develop.

It appears to several observers that
the building is available and the outline
of operation has been presented. A great
deal has been accomplished, but the sur-
face has barely been scratched.

The Union has come of age. Whether
it moves forward to achieve its latent
capacities or is relegated to a non-func-
tioning slot is up to you and me.

Noise Hurts Court

Dan LaFar’s remarks prefacing this
morning’s meeting of the Court of Con-
trol were all too true. If upperclassmen
regard the Court as they have in years
past, its long history will indeed “end
right here.”

Upperclass reaction was varied. While
many attempted to preserve the stony
silence necessary for effective operation,
others smelled the blood of years gone
by, and their behavior regressed accord-
ingly. And it. was obvious that the fresh-
men, solemn at the outset, soon sensed the
big-joke attitude of too many vociferous
sophomores, juniors and seniors, and im-
mediately chimed in.

It is unfortunate that the student body
was not more effectively forewarned to
the consequences of rowdyism before
this morning. Fraternity meetings last
night carried a plea for restraint, but
it was only partially effective.

The Court of Control will die a sudden
death this year unless upperclass cooper-
ation improves. That fact is obvious to
anyone at all close to or interested in the
project.

We hate to see it go, especially since a
sizable majority of the students seem to
want it retained.

But go it will, unless cooperation im-
proves, and soon.

Letters to Editor

Vital Shot in Arm

Needed by

The action taken last Wednes-
day by the Interfraternity Coun-
cil concerning intramural athletics
is a realistic approach to a prob-
lem that has wearied fraternities
and independents for several years.

Trying to round up a team of
fellows vexed with labs, term
papers, reviews, grades, and meet-
ings, has made the intramural pro-
gram burdensome instead of an
outlet for good competitive excer-
cise. When such an attitude de-
velops a reform in the nature pro-
posed by the IFC is in order.

As presented to the individ.
val fraternities Thursday, the
1FC is seeking to revise the
intramural activities along the
line of the varsity athletic
program. Under this designa-
tion, games such as ping-pong,
handball, and volleyball would
be withdrawn from the intra
mural listings.

Feeling that the primary pur-
pose of intramurals is to afford
an opportunity to those not so ac-

complished in @ sport as to play
for the intercollegiate varsity, the
present suggestion provides the
needed outlet. *

The proposal would make
the interfraternity standings
based on seven sports: foot-
ball, basketball, and softball,
plus swimming, wrestling,
track, and tennis.

Depleating the other sports
would enable the fraternities to
concentrate on somewhat fewer
sports and should correspondingly
taise enthusiasm which has been
noticeably dragging recently.

The ultimate outcome of
the idea should be that in-
terest would rise, competition
become keener, and more time
divided between studies and
athletics.

Perkinson and the IFC are to
be recognized for this forward
looking move, which has won the
overwhelming support of the fra-

Calls Upperclassmen

To Check

Long, long ago, during the ‘51-
‘52 school year; I wrote a column
for the Davidsonian, usually lam-
basting the status quo on campus,
seeking the bauble reputation even
in the cannon’s mouth of the
powers that be.

When the Navy was kind
enough to grant leave iast
may, | visited the campus, and
was overcome by a long-re-
pressed desire to become a
“college kid” again.
Unfortunately, Jim Batten is

plagued with that chronic malady
of Davidsonian editors: ‘no-copyi-
tis.” Even more unfortunately,
Batten has the memory of an ele-
phant.

and you, dear readers, are stuck
with me, for better or for worse.

The general theme of these first
few columns will be, naturally,
“Davidson Revisited”. I'd’ planned
to begin with generalized discus-
sions, but a specific campus prob-
lem of such seriousness as to war-
rant our immediate attention has
been* brought into focus during
the past two weeks.

heads. We have attempted to treat
them as adults, and they have re-

Just as an experiment, I gigged

Monday for having their beanie

reluctantly, after looking at me at

was an undignified stunt for an old
retread, but the principles of a
great Davidson tradition were at
stake.

For years Davidson's upper-
classmen have accepted the re-
sponsibility of making the
freshman’s transition from
adolescence to maturity as
peintess and as efficient ss
possible.

We aré failing to accept that
responsibility, and the Court of
Control cannot do it alone. Let us
meet the challenge before us with
immediate and effective action.

Each and every one of us should
participate in the strict enforce-
ment of the freshman regulations,
reporting all violations ruthlessly,
without fear or favor.

We must treat the Court with
the respect it deserves from the
freshmen, in order that they may
be reminded by our example that
it really means business.

It is up to us, as men of ma.
turity and experience, to give them
a sense of direction, guiding them
toward that ultimate goal of every
student within the confines of this
campus—the Davidson Gentleman.

Let us begin our task now—be-
fore it is too late.

IFC MEMBER COMMENTS ON RUSH WEEK

Freshmen Should Confirm Own Dates to Save Time

Davidson campus (to a lesser de-
gree, of course).

At five o'clock, September the
twenty-first, I observed joyful stu-
dents who were not quite so joy-
ful. However, they all had one
thing in common; they were un-
speakably happy to have the rush
week over.

During the past years, the LF.C.
and the College administration
have made many well-founded
rule changes in this system. There
is one part of this system which
has not received the proper amount
of attention from the pre-mentioned
group, I ask that the matter of
confirmation be given special rec-
ognition.

As it stands now, this situ-
ation is a sore spot in the
Present system. During the
two hour confirmation period,
much undye pressure is
brought to bear on many fresh-
men to change their dates.

A system of confirmation
which is to be deemed work-
able should eliminate ail
wasted motion and time. Here
is a laconic proposal which
meets this challenge.

During the summer, the fresh-
men would receive date cards as
in the present system. During the
orientation period or the first week
of school, the fraternity men
would be allowed to talk to any

freshmen concerning his dates:
possibly, he could add new ones.
if the freshman desires. This activ:
ity would be ceased the morning
of the confirmation day.

On confirmation day the
freshmen would be given in
chapel mimographed sheets
which would contain a blank
schedule of the coming rush
week. They would then affix
their rush schedule accord-
ingly.

That afternoon, during the two
hours of confirmation. they would
go to the Union ballroom on a
staggered schedule, bringing their
mimeographed sheets and

Kefauver, reelected in 1954,
