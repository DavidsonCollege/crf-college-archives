Child’s Cry Saturday Morning”

Its been too hot lately.

Saturday morning about eight o’clock
There was a rosy light and

it was cool and quiet.

I must have just been born when

That child cried out; little in the morning.

A mother was walking inthe street
outside her window,

Holding the infant in our arms.

Saturday night it was cool again, and
Twas with love herself. We were like
Babes in creation. It was that good.
Lord, you’ve just got to wail out

in that big beauty.

James Pittard 87

For Your Smile (when it was there)

When time reminds me of nothing.

I worry, —
Not much

just enough to fret.

cette = \

I loved your smile when it was there,

‘And when it wasn’t

There I put a memory.

The kind of memory you could fall asleep in
without nightmares.

¢

But I have nightmares .
And I’ve forgot that stuff I put in memories
And time reminds me of nothing
And I worry,
but not much
~____just-enough,__-__.

The Home Coming _
(A Parody of “The Second Coming”)

Turning and turning in a stumbling stupor,

The student cannot see the Cushman,

Freshmen fall down; their stomachs cannot hold:
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the.court.

The brew-dimmed tide is loosed and everywhere
The new drinking policy is drowned.

The best lack all perception, while the worst
Are only full of passionless ineptitude.

- Surely some de-evolution is at hand.
Surely the Home Coming is at hand.
The Home Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Davidsoniana
Trobles my sight: somewhere in the halls of Chambers,
A shape with a lanky body and the ‘head of a man,
With a gaze blank and pitiless as a highway patrolman.
Is moving its glazed eyes, while about it
Reel shadows of the indignant SGA.
The drunkeness rises again; but now I know:
-That oné-twenty proof brings stoned sleep
‘Which is oft vexed by the nightmares of a bed spins.
And what retching beast its stomach brimming at its mouth,
Slouches toward Belk to pass out?

Return from the Big Sea of Thought
-  Danc
‘Dean went fishing in the big sea of thought a
And showéd his mother what he’d caught
She just sighed and said, “Poor thing, it
I bet that sunburn really stings.” ++

Ruth
Ruth — I looked at the book in your name
-And saw the stars in your eyes
If there’s nothing in a name-
then maybe I’m insane Hold
But I can’t get closer to you than a
your story.
Was Oraph so wrong?
Was it so long ago, Coll

That your voice and your name
Weré the same.
They say, oh they say that a homecoming nears
And if I were brave I'd whisper to your ears
wee That [ love the name, Ruth
I love your name
And your smile, when it's there, is wdnderful.
