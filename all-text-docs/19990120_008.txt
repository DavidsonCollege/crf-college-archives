words sound cold, but they are
true. Rep. Dick Armey (R) of

Texas emphasized this phrase in his.

argument supporting the articles of
impeachment in the House of Repre-
sentatives on December 19th. The
House impeached President Clinton
on that historic day, but it remains to
be seen whether or not the Senate will
also vote toremove the President from
office. Two out of four Articles passed.
Article I indicts President Clinton for
perjury. Article [II asserts that he
obstructed justice. After both the trial
and voting are complete, we will have
a better idea of where this country
stands with respect to principle.

The House impeached Andrew
Johnson in 1868 when he fired his
secretary of war contrary to the opin-
ion of Congress. President Johnson
survived impeachment in the Senate
by a single vote. For 131 years no
other President hias ever been tried on
such a grand scale. President Richard
Nixon resigned before facing a vote in
the House following the Watergate
scandal.

The uncertainty of this trial results
from infrequent impeachment pro-
ceedings. In other words, there is not
much precedent. The Senators want
to follow the Constitution as closely

as possible. But, the Constitution .

also grants the Senate a wide berth in
order to proceed as it sees fit. That is
what is great
about the
Constitu-
tion. It pro-
vides direc-
tion but al-
lows for
change.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist
is presiding over the trial. The 100
Senators are acting as jurors. Sena-
tors may ask questions only in writ-
ing. Beyond those details, much has
yet to be determined. The trial details
must be established. Different groups
support different choices. But most
want a speedy trial. Should witnesses
be allowed to testify? Only time will
tell. I think that the trial should not
drag on, but I believe that the Senate
should consider what it must in order
to make a sound decision. If that
means calling witnesses such as
Monica Lewinsky, then so_be it.
What has disturbed me for so
long about President Clinton’s ac-
tions is that no one is willing to face
the facts.. So many people want a
speedy trial. Many support censure
instead of impeachment. Some polls
indicate that Americans don’t care

}_ rest.

President Clinton does behind closed
doors just as long as he runs the
country well. Others say that his
private life is
none of our
business. I
say this:
President
Clinton
made his pri-
vate life our business when he cheated
on his wife, lied to a grand jury, and
lied to every American citizen face to
face.

President Clinton should be im-
peached. Nothing more, and cer-
tainly nothing less. Censure should
not even be an option in this case.
The Senate should try the President.
They should not accept an under-
thetable deal. Length cannot get in
the way of justice. President Clinton
could have ended this matter last
January if he had only admitted his
mistake then. But his lying, deceit-
ful, and manipulating ways prolonged
the issue. What’s done is done. No
one can go back in time and change
anything that President Clinton did.

Now that the facts are out, the Senate

must address them properly.

There is no doubt in my mind that
President Clinton should be im-
peached. I am sure that he would

love this to drag on so long that it is
dropped because everyone is sick of
the issue. No one should be. It is a
national issue, and every American
citizen should know the facts. Every-
one should care because the moral
issues at stake affect each and every

- one of us.

For an analysis, let’s consider that
President Clinton were a student at
The Davidson
Honor Code doesn’t allow anyone to
lie. Under our law, or in effect our
constitution, President Clinton would
be forced to leave the school for vio-
lating its most sacred rule. How would
you feel if a student lied to your face
and then received a slap on the wrist?
That wouldn’t be right, would it? The
Constitution is our country’s most
sacred law. President Clinton broke
our country’s laws by lying to a grand
jury. That is why he should be forced
to leave his Presidential office.

President Clinton did this to him-
self. He is the only person that can be
held responsible. We should support
the principle of honor that is at stake.
We cannot support the person be-
cause he violated that principle. Presi-
dent Clinton would be forced to leave
Davidson, and he should be impelled
to leave office. I believe that the
Senate should impeach him.

rhe holy fast of Ramazan

or nearly a month now, 1.6 bil
‘lion Muslims have been observ
ing the holy fast of Ramazan,
the ninth month of the Islamic lunar

prayer, reciting the Holy Quran, asking
repentance for
their sins. The
fast constitutes
‘the fourth pillar
of Islam, or
Sawm which lit-
erally means at
Sawm is
absolutely mandatory, unless you are
ill, pregnant, a minor, or insane. Dur-
ing the entire month, Muslims awake
early in the morning before dawn, sehri;
eating something before the inception
of the fast. After making an intention
during sehri, Muslims abstain from
eating, drinking (including water), and
indulging in sexual activity from sun-
rise till sunset. Muhammad (pbuh),
last prophet of Islam, said “Whosoever
eats during one day of Ramazan, with-
out a valid excuse (acceptable reli-
giously), shall never be able to recoup
that day even by fasting for the rest of
his life.” Well, what’s the point? Why
do 1.6 billion people starve themselves
and chant strange phrases in some
uncomprehensive language. called,
Arabic?

First, Sawm is an order from Allah
(swt). Al-Quran says: “O those who
believe! Fasting is prescribed for you,

calendar. Muslims spend the month in ~

even as it was prescribed for those
before you, that you may ward off
evil....He who fasts abandons the lust
and craving of his appetite for My sake.”
Incidentally, the Gospel writers tell us
that even Jesus fasted in the desert for

forty days and forty

nights. _Remark-
- ably, fasting creates

a Zen awareness.

We become pious

and show humility

before Allah (swt).

The pangs of star-
vation remind us how fortunate we are—
how much God has given us—and at
times, ungrateful. Sawm allows Mus-
lims to experience hardship for the sake
of Allah (swt). We struggle throughout
the day trying to train our minds. The
task intensifies in a non-Muslim set-
ting. Fasting strengthens a person’s
faith in the oneness of God and the
realization of an awaiting death. Mus-.
lims believe that a single fast of
Ramazan is more valuable than a life-
time of fasts outside Ramazan. More-
over, Ramazan creates a democratic
ideal of equality. Whether rich or poor,
educated or ignorant, well—mannered
or rustic, each Muslim is equal before
the eyes of Allah (swt). The entire
Muslim ummah (brotherhood) unites
as a single entity of religious submis-
sion. At the end of the month, Muslims
gather all over the world and celebrate
together Eid, a festival of thanksgiving.
