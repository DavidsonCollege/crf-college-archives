In focus ... NEW PROFESSOR

Avinger enjoys students’ energy

By ANDREW PRESTON
Staff Writer

After19 years in the entrepre-
neurial business, Economics Pro-
fessor Bob Avinger is once again a
professor at Davidson. Avinger
taught at Davidson from 1967 until
1980, wher he decided to go into
private business full time. Avinger
has returned to Davidson for the
spring semester because the Eco-
nomics Department needed help
teaching all of the classes that were
offered.

Avinger graduated from
Davidson with a double major in
history and economics and earned
his doctorate from Duke Univer-
sity. He decided to become an eco-

‘ nomics professor partly because he

“had a few mentors at Davidson,
including Charles Ratcliff of the
Economics Department. As an eco-
nomics professor I am able to enjoy
both the academic life and entrepre-
neurial world.” Avinger continues
to work in private business while
teaching.

Avinger enjoys many outdoor
activities in his free time, including
slow-pitch softball and skiing.

“When I was a professor here
before, Davidson professors had one
of the best slow-pitch teams around.
We won the championship almost
every year,” he says.

Avinger also enjoys reading
“almost anything” and watching
Jeopardy.

“The thing that makes teaching
really rewarding is the students at

Davidson,” Avinger adds. He en-
joys teaching small classes of “en-
ergetic, intelligent, dilligent stu-
dents.” Avinger adds that the stu-
dents are just as much fun to teach
as they were when he first taught at
Davidson.

Computer service is going online

By AINSLEY HINEs

Computer Services at Davidson
has created a listserv to update stu-
dents on the latest intership and job
offers. Tony Butchello, assistant
director of Career Services, says
that students will be given access to
the latest information in the jobs.

“Tt will have anything we get
‘across ourdésk that WE think would
be interesting to students,” says
Butchello.

A listserv is a way to distribute
email according to the particular
interests of the users of a system.

Addressing a mes-
sage toa listserv sends
a duplicate copy of
the message to every-
one registered to the
listserv.

Signing up for a
listserv requires typ
ing a series of simple
commands via e-
mail. There are listservs for just
about anything, from Cajun cook-
ing to rocket science.

Bill Felty, associate director of
Career Services, hopes students will
list job opportunities that they think
might interest others, as well. “We
want students to post things that are
relevant for others,” says Felty.

In order to prevent ‘large
amounts of mail reaching students
on jobs and events that do not inter-
est them, Career Services plans on
titling each subject with a message
pertaining to the topic such as “Jun-
ior females seeking intership in hotel
management.”

The listserv was inspired over

Winter Break during a Career Ser-

‘vices meeting. Butchello explained

that Career Services gets hundreds
of updates on open interships ev-
eryday and that they wanted a way
to contact students about the latest
updates.

Felty suggested that they cre-
ate a listserv. While working at the
University of Kentucky, Felty cre-
ated a universal listserv called
JobPlace.

This listserv is now used by
Career Service deparments all over
the country. Together, with help
from the Computer Services de-
partment, the Career Services
listserv was created.
