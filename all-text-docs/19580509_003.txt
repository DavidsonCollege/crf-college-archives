All That

By JIM HAMILTON

The Southern Conference Rules Committee deliv-
ered a stiff blow in an unprotected place in the Wild-
eat hide last week when it ruled freshmen ineligible for
varsity competition come December of this year. It hurts
because, as any coach in the athletic department will
tell you, freshmen are needed at a school this small.

Lest any doubt remain in your minds consider
the contributions as freshmen of Bill Price, Craig Wall,
Don Killian, George Hart, Angus McBryde, or closer
home. present frosh, Bill Shinn, Tom Hudgins, Claude
Finney and Verner Stanley. Or what about the varsity
tennis team of ’56 when four of the top six were fresh-
men. The list could easily be lengthened, but [ think
the point is proven.

The Davidson representation saw this point

ception of West Virginia and V.P.1., are comparatively
small. Why would they vote for such a measure? It seems
to me the reason is that the schools in this conference
can't or won’t buck the N.C.A.A., which declares fresh-
men ineligible. West Virginia, who participates in nu-
merous.N.C.A.A. tournaments, went so far as to threaten
to leave the conference if the motion was defeated.

In our own situation, a Davidson conference title,
say in baseball, would mean that neither freshmen or
seniors in their fourth year of varsity competition would
be eligible for the regional play-offs.

The N.C.A.A. is a good organization, but its rules
are sometimes favorable only for the big schools, and
when a rule declares over 25 per cent of a relatively
small student body ineligible, it sprains the athletic
sacroiliac to bend over backwards to please.

ODDS AND ENDS

Thanks to George Ramsey, who helped send this
page to press last week while I was up in Virginia.

It appears an apology is in order. Several weeks
ago | promised to includes the conference standings
for all varsity sports on this page. Well, with the ex-
ception of baseball, it seems as if nobody keeps
them for spring sports since the championships in
golf, track and tennis are all decided in tournaments.
Any standings that are available will be printed on
this page.

It’s the balmy month of May, the sun is shining,
the birds aresinging; and white shorted youths flock to
the tennis court in droves for an afternoon of recrea-
tion. But still one court stands unused. Why? Because
it is still filled with pebbles, without sufficient lines.
and still minus a net. The next “why” would be much
harder to answer.

Due to the fact: that softball results have not been
turned in to Mr. Howard regularly, we are unable to
print the I. F. standings this week.

“It was one of the best ball games I've seen,”
mented Coach Stevens on Davidson’s 3-2 victory over
Furman last Saturday in the first game of a double-

score of 12-7.

FURMAN GAME

In a loosely played second
game, Furman combined David-
son’s errors and eight hits for
the onesided win. Coach Stevens
remarked that he thought it
was the worst game played by
the Wildcats since the Citadel
game.

The doubleheader with
V.P.1. scheduled for last
Tuesday was called off be-
cause. of bad weather. It
has been re-scheduled for
Tuesday, May 12, at Blacks-
burg, Va.

The Wildcats now hold down' 2%
second place in the Southern’ %&
Conference with a record of
seven wins and two losses and
an over-all record of eleven vic-
| tories and only four defeats, In
ifirst place is Richmond, but
they have seven conference
games remaining. This means
that Davidson has a good chance
of coming aut with the top
Jaurels in the Southern Confer-
ence.
