SIGMA CHI’S WINNING HOMECOMING PROJECT

Homecoming A Success
After Gray Beginning

Although Homecoming 1964 appeared on the verge of being washed out Friday
afternoon, the down pour subsided after Davidson’s soccer team bettered its record
to three wins with a sound 5-1 drubbing of Duke, leaving a muddy path for the cul-
turally inclined to tread in order to watch the incantations of the Raduga dancers.

Viewed with some apprehen
sion before Friday night, the
Russians turned out to be a
real success.

By Saturday morning the
rains had ceased completely,
and Davidson gentlemen and
their dates came out to watch
the Big Red square off against
Richmond. Despite the large
partisan crowd in Richardson
Stadium, the Red and Black
Machine could not contain Rich-
mond's Spiders. Out to fight
and looking mean, the ‘Cats
fell 20-7.

The trustees also required
that similar questions’ be put

jin a ceremony to its own pros-

pective members, and it stipu-
lated what requirements would
be made of present faculty
members and trustees.

The action appeared in the
form of amendments to the by-
laws; according to the by-laws,
such amendments must be rati.
fied at the next meeting by
two-thirds of the trustees pres-
ent, before they become effec-
tive.

NEW FACULTY MEMBERS

The amendment regarding
prospective faculty members
reads, in part, as follows:

“The Administration, before
nominating a faculty member
shal! request of the individual
concerned an answer in writing
to at least the following ques-
tions.

“a. Do you approve the pur-
pose of Davidson as stated by
the Trustees?

“b. Of what evangelical
church are you a member?

“e. Do you acknowledge Jesus
Christ as Lord and Saviour and
do you believe in the funda-
mental teachings of Bvangelical
Christianity?

“d. Do you accept the Scrip-
tures of the Old and New Tes-
tament as the revelation of
God’s will, the final guide in
matters of faith and practice?

“e. If appointed to the Fac-
ulty of Davidson College, would
it be your purpose, in reliance
upon Divine Grace, so to live
and teach as to promote the
purpose of the college and to
give expression to the Chris-
tian faith?”

in a DAVIDSONIAN inter.
view Saturday, Dr. J. McDowell
Richards, president of the
board, explained the amend.
ments and their meaning.

DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTION

He first pointed out the pur-
pose of the measures. With
these steps, he said, the trus-
tees “try to maintain the Chris.
tian commitment of Davidson

ficult act to follow, but. the duo | principle contribution in the

but never boring.

Mrs. Peter Nicholls, supervi-
sor of dormitories, faced some
trying moments in the early
hours of the weekend, her first
“big’ one at Davidson, when
50 students anpeared at the
end of last week with 50 home-
less waifs for dates. Undaunted,
however, Mrs. Nicholls located

jfield of educaton.”

When asked what groups the
term. “evangelical” might cover,
as it appears in items: ‘‘b."’ and
“¢,," Richards said, “Generally
speaking, this is used in the
sense of ‘protestant.’ He said
that it would not rule out the
Greek Orthodox Church which
participates in the World Coun-
cil of Churches and the Nation
al Council of Churches. He ad
ded, however, “I don’t think we
would find a Roman Catholic
that would desire a position
here,” and a Unitarian church
member would not be accept-
ed.

He said that he foresaw little
additional difficulty in getting
new faculty members because

Trustees Take Other Action

Besides dealing with the
faculty oath issue, the trustees
last Friday heard the presi-
dent's report, approved minor
increases in fees, approved
sabbatical leaves for two facul-
_ty members, and expressed
gratitude and sympathy to cer-
tain persons associated with
Davidson.

President D. G. Martin's re-
port to the trustees stated that
‘it is probable that no other
institution in the Southeast
will have a freshnian class of
boys superior to the one en-
to'led at Davidson.”

The report discussed changes
in the colleges handling of stu-
dents whose progress is un-
Satisfactory. “Student under-
achievement will still receive
the attention of the faculty,
but under a new plan adopt-
ed by the faculty last spring
the underachievers will receive
assistance and counseling from
members of the faculty before
more serious measures are ap-
plied.”

The president also said that
“the college since 1956 has in-
creased its piant and endow.
ment (total resources) from

$13 million to approximately
$21.7 million, with a goal of
$34 million in total resources
by 1971.

The trustees approved in-
creases in the per semester
laundry fee of not more than
$5 per student and in the per
semester cafeteria board rate
of not more than $25 per stu-
dent.

Martin said that these price
increases were designed to
cover the higher costs caused
by today’s higher wages and
higher costs of materiats.

The trustees approved sab-

batical leaves of absence for
Dr. Joseph T. Drake, profes-
sor of sociology, and Dr. Thom-
as F. Clark, associate professor
of Bible and reilgion.

The expressed gratitude to
Mrs. Sara Dee Johnston for her
27-year service in the college
infirmary.

The body also expressed sym.
pathy to the families of Michael
Haro'd Bell and Fairman Pres-
ton St. Clair, two members of
the class of ‘9866 who were
killed recently in an automobile
accident. ,

Faculty And Trustees

_ The Board of Trustees passed amendments Jast
Friday that if ratified at the next meeting will replace
the faculty oath with a series of questions in writing to

of the new procedures. “I think
it will not keep a man of Chris-
tian faith from Davidson."

Richards acknowledged that
the special requirement con-
cerning teachers in the depart-
ments of Bible and philosophy
might cause some trouble.
These men, unless “outstanding
both in scholarship and in
Christian faith,” as the amend.
ment states, must be committed
to the standards of. the Presby-
terian Church, U.S.

Richards said regarding phi-
losophy, “This is perhaps. the
hardest field we have in which
to get a thoroughly competent
professor.”

“REASONABLE SOLUTION”

President D. Grier Martin dis-
cussed the trustees move in an
interview on Tuesday. “This
‘seems to me to be a reasonable
solution to a very difficult prob-
lem,” he said.

He indicated that initial fac-
ulty response was favorable to
the proposal. “I have had some
testimony from faculty mem-
bers since this was done that
they could live with this.”

Martin commended the rela-
tionship that existed between
the trustees and the faculty
members during the working-
out of the new position. “This
has demonstrated the ability of
the faculty and trustees to sit
down and reason things out in
a dialogue that was very won-
derful to see and experience.”

NEW TRUSTEES

In further action, the trustees
approved amendments which
would require newly-elected
trustees to be “active members
of some Evangelical Christian
church”; to answer questions:
“a.." “e.,” and “d." above, in a
ceremony conducted by the
president of the trustees at the
beginning of the first meeting
attended by each new trustee;
and to answer at the same time
the following question:

“In accepting office as a trus-
tee do you undertake to be
faithful in promoting the pur-
pose of the college and in seek-
ing to increase its effectiveness
as an institution of Christian
learning?”

Richards pointed out that by
this action the trustees and the
faculty now are expected to em-
brace substantially “the same
set of broad Christian prin
ciples, while their commitments
are fitted to their role in the
college.

CURRENT AFFILIATIONS

The situation of present fac-
ulty members and trustees was
also covered by an amendment:

“All members of the faculty
prior to attaining tenure or to
their next promotion in rank
and all present members of the
trustees shall be asked to reply
in writing to the question “e.”
under section 82 (‘e.” above).
Question e shall be altered to
read: In accepting your new
status as a member of the Fac-
ulty, is it your continuing pur-
pose, so to live and teach as to
promote the purpose of the col-
lege and to give expression to
the Christian Faith.”

The statement continues:

“In requesting this statement
the Administration shall ex-
plain to those concerned that
this is requested not as an in-
quisition, or through any lack
of confidence, but because of
our belief that the relationship
of all faculty members and all
trustees to the college should
be basically the same.”

He said that the content of
the amendments was reached
“after full consultation with
members of the faculty, partic-
ularly with Dr. Martin and Dr.
Johnston.”

Poll Shows
Faculty
Disagrees

By BOB VANCE
Davidsonian Statf Writer

Nineteen faculty members
disapproved of the religious test
now pending as a substitute for
the present faculty vow, a poll
of the faculty revealed this
week. Of the 34 professors re-
sponding to the Davidsonian
poll, 10 approved of the substi-
tute test, while five had no
comment.

Twenty: of those polled said
that they disapproved of the
present faculty vow, and of
these, three supported the sub-
Stitute religious test. Of the
ten professors who approved of
the present vow, six approved
the religious test. Two faculty
members had no comment on
the present vow and one of
those approved the substitute
religious test.

The poll questionnaires were
distributed to all 83 of the
members of the faculty, and the
34 who responded represent 41
per cent of the faculty.

Among the faculty members
who approved both the present
vow and the proposed religious
test, one replied that ‘“‘a pro-
fessor in a church college may
be reasonably expected to take
some kind of vow.”

Expressing a different point
of view another professor stat-
ed that “the psychology behind
a required oath is not consist-
ent with the fundamental as-
sumptions of higher education.”
In agreement with this view
was another professor who felt
that “a vow is personally insult-
ing—faith is a matter of be-
havior, not belief.”

One of the professors who ex-
pressed disapproval of the pres-
ent vow, but who approved the
substitute religious test ex-
plained his views by: saying
that the religious test is “aboul
as good as any so far proposed
—TI can live with it.”

One supporter of the vow
and pending test explained:
“I realize that others feel that
it is crucial so far as they are
concerned, but I can be no
more than sympathetic since 1
do not personally share their
resentment to oaths, vows and
like statements.”

Wrote one opponent: “This
new proposal, because of its
vastly wider application, is
even less in accord with the
oft-trumpted desire of the ad-
ministration to create here in
North Mecklenburg a superior
liberal arts college than was
the older requirement. One
wonders what the Ford Founda-
tion, to whose largesse David-
son is currently laying suit,
will think of the Trustees’
stated conception of Davidson
as the ‘teaching arm of the
church.’ Academic excellence
and theological orthodoxy make
incompatible classmates.”

Faculty Oath History
Reveals Long Dissent

By BOB HOLLADAY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

its worvidson College has been a long time in feeling
way toward the new stand regarding th igi
affiliations of iis faculty members eme religious
n . the oath was defended in THE DAVID-
SONIAN by Dean of the Faculty C. K. Brown. He sup-
ported it on two counts—(1) the oath was a part of the
remit tradition, and (2) the follege had the right to
re the oath as a means of keepi i
re the church ping Davidson close
e student newspaper argued with Brown, sayin
that there was a difference between “freedom” ynd
“right: ’ “Davidson has the freedom to require any oath
it sees fit, but it does not necessarily have the right.”
; In 1958, the paper polled 62 faculty members, find-
ing a 75 per cent approval of the oath among David-
son’s mentors.

CRITICISM FOUND

The paper also uncovered criticism of the oath,
however. Some men felt that it restricted the number
of capable men who would wish to teach at Davidson.
Others disagreed with the time and place of the oath’s
administration.

One faculty member seemed prophetic of the new
trustee decision when he commented, “These. questions
could be put to a man at the time of initial employment.
They certainly do not belong at a commencement ex-
ercise before a strange audience.”

In, 1963, the oath became an issue when some facul-
.ty members who were opposed to the oath urged the
faculty to recommend that the trustees change or
abolish it.

The oath was to be administered at commencement
to full professors only, at the time of their inaugura-
tion. The candidate was to answer three “yeas” to the
following questions:

_‘(a) Do you acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord and
Saviour and do your believe in the fundamental teach-
ings of evangelical Christianity?

“(b) Do you believe the Scriptures of the Old and
New Testament to be the word of God, the only infal-
lible rule of faith and practice?

“(c) Do you promise in humble reliance upon the
grace of God which comes by the Holy Spirit, so to live
and teach as to give expression to the Christian faith?”

STRONG OPPOSITION

THE DAVIDSONIAN of that year quoted President
D. G. Martin as saying that faculty opposition was
strong: “I think it is probable that the great majority
of the faculy do not want to have this (oath) to work
under.”

One faculty member thought that the oath was in-
consistent with the college’s attitude: “The oath harms
the real attitude the college has and puts us in an as-
sociation with a group of narrow and bigoted colleges.
The oath does not represent us as we really are.”

Another professor argued that the oath hurt the
college’s chances of getting new faculty members, while
other men supported the oath. defending the college’s
desire through the oath to retain its close church-col-
lege relationship.

FACULTY QUESTIONNAIRE

Reporting faculty opinion about the oath (learned
by way of a questionnaire distributed to the faculty) to
the trustees during the Board’s meeting that February.
Martin said, “The main objection of the majority. of
those opposed to the oath seems to be in the manner
in _ it is administered (at public graduation exer-
cises).”

Martin and President of the Trustees J. McDowell
Richards said that there seemed to be little objection to
the spirit of the oath. They said that the solution would
probably be a compromise in which the oath was kept
in the same form but would be administered privately,
as part of the hiring process.

The controversy was referred to the Trustee Ed-
ucation Committee. At the subsequent meeting of the
trustees, however, the committee’s report was deferr-
ed to the meeting of February, 1964.

CHANGES MADE

At that gathering this year, the form of the oath
was changed, the oath was given wider coverage, and
the conditions of its administering were also altered.

The new vow consisted of two questions:

“1, Do you acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord and
Saviour as revealed in the Holy Scripture and will you
endeavor to live a life consistent with this profession?

“2. Do you dedicate yourself to the vocation of
teaching and will you seek faithfully to perform the
task of teacher, to inform the minds of students and to
create in them a thirst for knowledge, a love of wisdom.
and a reverence for truth?” .

All men eligible for tenure were to be required to
take the oath at a commissioning service held in the col-
