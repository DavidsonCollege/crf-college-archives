DuPont Fund Gives Davidson
Grant For President’s Fund

By ELLIE BROWN

The Jessie Bell duPont Fund
has announced a $30,000 grant to
Davidson College through its Small
Liberal Arts College Initiative.

The grant is being made to
Davidson President John W.
Kuykendall’s discretionary fund,
to be used for college purposes as
he sees fit.

Kevin McCarthy, director of
corporate and foundation relations
forthecollege, stated “These funds
are always significant because they
give the institution a degree of
flexibility.”

Davidson was one of 37 small
liberal arts colleges to receive the

recent duPont grants. $10,000 of
the money has already been paid to

Davidson, and the rest will paid’

over the next five years.

Launched by the Jessie Ball
duPont Religious, Charitable and
Educational Fund, the Small Lib-
eral Arts College Initiative has three
components: the President’s Dis+
cretionary Fund, the National
Humanities Center Faculty Schol-
ars and the National Humanities
Center Liberal Arts College Sum-
mer Institute.

Money allocated for the Presi-
dent’s Discretionary Fund may be
used “for any insitutional purpose,”
according t the duPont Fund an-
nouncement of the grants.

Established by the will of the
late Jessie Ball duPont, widow of
Alfred I. duPont, the Jessie Ball
duPont Religious, Charitable and
Educational Fund awards grants to
institutions to which Mrs. duPont
contributed from 1960 to 1964.

The fund supports programs in
education, health, human services,
religion, culture, the environment
and historic preservation. Grants
are made primarily to address the
emerging issues and needs of the
South.

Minority programs, need-
based scholarships, and programs
designed to train future leaders
through private higher education
are targeted.

Meaning of POW Experience

Porter Halyburton, a 1963
Davidson graduate and POW in
North Vietnam for 7-1/2 years,
will speak about his “Search for
Meaning” at his alma mater on
Sunday, December 2. The free
public lecture begins at 7:30 p.m.
in the Art Gallery of Chambers
Building.

Halyburton now serves as a
professor of strategy and policy at
the Naval War College in Provi-
dence, Rhode Island.

He was taken prisoner in 1965
when his fighter plane was shot
down over North Vietnam. For
many months he was presumed
killed, and a funeral was held for
him in his hometownof Davidson.
When he was released in 1973 and
returned to Davidson for a home-
coming, he was presented with the
headstone from his grave. He keeps
it now in his back yard in Provi-

dence.

Though he-was tortured and
deprived by hiscaptors, Halyburton
shuns bitterness over his experi-
ence. He looks instead to the friend-
ships and opportunities that re-
sulted from his imprisonment.

Atone point he nursed a badly
injured fellow POW, Fred Cherry,
and kept his comradealive through
ill treatment by their captors. He
and Cherry developed a deep and
lasting friendship from the experi-
ence.

Initially he and other POW’s
passed time merely waiting for their
release. Butsoon he realized, “there
was life to be lived there in prison
in addition to the life to come after-
wards,” he said.

He began to pass his days in
highly disciplined training of his
mind, setting up a mental filing
cabinet with over 70 slots for sub-
jects as diverse as “Aviation,”
“Family,” and “Photography.”

When person D purchased his
1979 Honda, some creative past
owner had tampered with the logo.
All but the “a” in Honda had been
removed and replaced by the first
three letters of a “Dodge” emblem
ripped off a lowly Chrysler. Hence
person D’s mode of transportation
became affectionately known as
“the Doda.”

truck, a book, poetry - was learned
and regularly reviewed. Haly-
burton also wrote poems, one of
which was released by the Associ-
ated Press and printed nationwide
when he was freed.

Today, Halyburton stops short
of criticizing the aims of the Vict-
nam War. He saves his finger point-
ing for the leaders who carried it
out. “If I could put the blame on
anyone it would be Lyndon
Johnson,” he said. “Anyone who
was knowledgeable about Vietnam
was ostracized as a Communist,
and Johnson ignored some good
advice from them.”

Still a warrior, though of a
different sort, he is dedicated to
training future leaders. “I hope to

Noting a sinking feeling in his
gut, person C observed, “Uh-Oh, I
hope person B took that gas out of
person D’s trunk.” Close upon this
realization, the phonerang. Person
A answered, “Oh, hello officer.
You say person D’s car seems to
have combusted? Yea, it seems I
might know something about that.”

What followed was an awak-
ening of sorts. Persons A,B, andC
examined the’scene of the confla-
gration and person.A spoke with
the Davidson police. The truth
became painfully apparent. Some-
how the chemicals in the trunk had
mixed together. Perhaps some
motor oil leaked on the HTH, but
it’s hard to say. Anyway, the stufi
blew. The insides of the Doda
burned to ashes and the back win-
dow ended up about eight feet from
car itself. As person D noted sadly,
“Nothing j is salvageable” (includ-
ing, ironically enough, person A’s
cap and gown).

Confronting person D and
accepting resonsibility for their
transgressions, persons A,B, andC
stated, “Person D, we’re sorry we
blew up your Doda.” Stated per-
son D, “Now I don’t have.a car.”

An excited observer ap-
proached the shell-shocked clan,
“Man,” quoth he, “I wonder what
woud have happened if somebody
had been driving when it wentoff!”
The four felt intruded upon by the
pytic- voyeur. Turning slowly. to
face his questioner, person C sur-
mised, “Idon’tknow, but wouldn’t
of wanted to be in the trunk.”

Person A continued abitcoldly,
“Hey man, it’s a modern world.
Cars get blown up. Whada’ you .
want?”

The four wandered off together,
still friends but wondering how to
remove this financial monkey
wrench from the inner workings of
their relationship.. The observer
remained behind, poking through
Doda’s ash ridden innards. Fortu-

nately, person D had already re-
