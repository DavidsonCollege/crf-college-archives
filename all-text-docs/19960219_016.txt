Ozone flies
high, takes
Wildcats
with him

By MicHaAEL Kruse
Assistant Sports Editor

Brandon Williams has
always been a gifted athlete.
“T used to beat people in
high school because I could
jump higher or run faster,”
said Williams.
Because of his as-
tounding leaping ability, he

earned the nickname
“Ozone” before he entered
ninth grade.

Although an exaggera-
tion (the ozonosphere is
roughly 25 miles above the
earth’s surface), the moni-
ker seemed appropriate.
After all, “Ozone” could
dunk at age 13.

This inherent
athleticism allowed Will-
iams to star at Phillips Exeter
Academy in New Hamp-
shire, where he was twice a
captain and a Five-Star All
Star, and a McDonald’s All-
American nominee and a
Blue Ribbon All-American
as a senior.

Heavily recruited, Wil-
liams chose Davidson over
Atlantic-10 members St.
Joseph’s (Pa.) and Fordham,
and Tulane of Conference
USA.

“T knew that it would be
a battle to come here, that it
wouldn’t be bright lights or
big headlines,” said Will-
jams, “But the benefits of
hard°work would be excep-
tional.”

And they have been.
Over the past four years,
Williams has developed into
more than just an exceptional
athlete.

He is now an excep-
tional basketball player on
an exceptional basketball
team, as he leads the 20-3
Wildcats on a crash course
with NCAA tournament des-
tiny.

“When you get to col-
lege, the difference in your
game is the mental aspect
and not so much physical.
I’ve really learned to play
the game,” understated Wil-
liams.

After averaging 6.7
points per game as a rookie,
Williams burst on the South-
ern Conference scene as a
sophomore, recording 14.4
points and 6.3 rebounds a
contest and securing All-
Conference honors.

But the team fell just
shy of its NCAA dreams,
succumbing to Tennessee-

“Ozone” Williams wheels to score two more points against App. St.

Josh Glazer

Chattanooga in the confer-
ence championship, 65-64.

The Mocs danced in
March Madness. Davidson
settled for an NIT bid.

Last year the Wildcats
experienced a lackluster
campaign, posting a 14-13
mark. Similarly, Williams
suffered an ankle injury and
never quite got on track.

“T found myselfin anew

(leadership) role andI started
listening to what people were
saying and expecting of me
and the team and I forgot to
really go out and earn it like
I had, and like we had in
sophomore year,” said Wil-
liams, “I began to take things
for granted.”

But Williams has done
none of that this season,
working his way to a new

level of stardom. He leads
the team in points (18 per
game), rebounds (6 per
game), minutes (26.6 per
game), three-point shooting
(46%), and blocked shots (.9
per game).

With his 23-point per-
formance on Saturday ver-
sus The Citadel, Williams,
who now has 1,378 career
points, became the 11th-

leading scorer in Davidson
history. His eighth point to-
night will vault him onto the
top ten all-time Wildcat scor- ©
ing list.

Said classmate Quinn
Harwood, “Brandon’s great.
He’s one of those players
who you want on your team
at the end of the game.”

Against Mississippi and
Williams College earlier this
year, both overtime wins,
Williams scored 32 and 38

_ points, respectively, both

career highs at the time.
“When I play, it’s all
about what’s happening at
that very moment. At the
end of the game, I should be
proud of my effort and my

. team’s effort.”

Williams is surrounded
by a star-studded supporting
cast, as the Wildcats are in
the midst of their best sea-
son since the Nixon admin-
istration.

Said Williams, “What
makes teams very good is
when players can yield to
eachother. AndIthink that’s
what makes our team a spe-
cial team. I want to be re-
membered as a player who
helped Davidson get back
ontrack. We were a national
power years ago and I want
people to not forget about
Davidson basketball and the
commitment that we have to
excellence here.”

And if Davidson cap-
tures the conference tourna-
menttitle in the first week of
March, Wildcat fans will
have amemory they’ ll never
forget.

“T expect to win it and
go on to the Big Dance,”
Williams said, “There’s no
doubt.”

Wildcat rugby wins; Burkhardt boots Radford

By Wit BALDWIN

In aclash of two highly touted
rugby squads on a cold day in
which the hits were hard and plen-
tiful and both teams’ defenses came
up big, Davidson bettered Radford,
9-3, on the IMAC fields Saturday.

“It was obvious from the first
tackle that the team with the stron-

gest, mostconsistent defense would
come out on top,” said club presi-
dent Thayer Long.

Davidson, with good ball
movement among the backs and
several hard runs by Warren Buford
in his first game back from a knee
injury, continually pressured the

Radford defense in the first half.

The Wildcats used a few penalty
runs to keep the opposition pinned

Radford knotted the contest on a
dropkick just before halftime.
The second half featured more
viciqus tackling from both sides,
including several blows from
Davidson’s John Spainhour. The
teams pushed each other up and
