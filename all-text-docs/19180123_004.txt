A letter from Jno. S. Moore, of Bir-
mingham, Ala., A.B. ’#5, written from
the University Union, Paris, December
18, says: “I had just gone to sleep
when a note came up from Mac. Rum-
ple; he had seen my name on the register
and came right up. He is second
lieutenant, C. A., an hes been to differ-
ent schools since he came over ; was pass-
ing through Paris on his way to another
one. We have an idea he will end up
by going home as instructor. He and |
bummed around together in Paris until
he left Saturday night, and managed to
see a good deal of the well-known parts
of it.”
