One Last Shot

As we prepare for the advent. of
the new “editorial we’’ there still ex-
ists a tremendous desire to.say some-
thing about the Davidson image.

So in this, the final editorial
column of this editorship, we would
like to offer a few random comments
concerning that image, as it concerns
both administration and student.

Administration

There seems to be ‘a rather awe
some identity gap between the _pic-
ture of the college’ as distributed by
the administration and the realistic
view of the college.

Maybe it is only our imagination,
but we have been unaware ef the con-
struction of any learning center and
honors. college, which the new cata-
logue of information on the school
produly describes to prospective stu-
dents.

How strange it.is to read about
such a great development in the aca-
demic life of Davidson College and
not be able to find. it. i

To be sure, we are just as inter-
ested as the te aw inked

of school. .

_ The stress on acidemic revelance
and progress should be increased,
and an attempt should be made to
view the changing Davidson today,
rather than the emphasis on histori-
cal traditions. The fatter is fine in
its place, but few students choose
on the basis of tradition.

But_the main emphasis should be
on honesty and clarity, rather than
a picture based half on what David-
son might be. ~

Along similar lines, it would be
wise. for the administration to recon-
sider the little ‘good news’. sheet
which it distributes regularly to the
alumni.

It-does serve the purpose of keep
ing the alumni aware of the activi-
ties of their classmates and other
alumni, but it fails miserably in
giving the reader an accurate view
of the college in its daily existence

bulletins: the alumni are unfamiliar
with, the college situationeand thus
unprepared for the shock of such re-
ports as came out of the Spencer
Commissions.

If alumni. had been familiar with
the financial burdens of the current
athletie programs, there would have
been much less outcry at the sugges-
tion of desubsidization of football.

If they had been told about stu

dent dissatisfaction over the present
social system and education by celi-
bacy, there would have been less fire
about the new recommendations for
coeducation and social patterns.

If alumni had been aware of the
crying needs of the area circling
Davidson, they would have jumped
at the suggestion of extra-campus re-
sponsibility.

But until the college assumes the
proper role of informing its alumni
about the needs and failures of the

institution’s multi-systemal operation,
there will still be disbelief, discord
and dissatisfaction among this group.

At a time when communication be-

. tewen the student and his predeces-

sors is at a critical point, the college
cannot afford failure in this area.

Students

It used to be that sttidents at Da-
vidson cared about image; it meant
sure dates, sure graduate school ac-
cepiance and sure employment.

But image seems to occupy a rather
precarious position on the student
checklist today, if it hasn't been ditch-
ed all together, and we aren’t so sure
that this is good.

Oh, it’s fine to ditch that ald image
of Southern gentleman’s character,
because that would be ‘hypocritical.

And it’s okay to drop the idea of
Davidson being the best party school
in the area, because it no longer is.
It isn’t even second.

No, sir. We’re doing away with all
the images. From here on we're stick-
ing to the real us. That's what it’s
all about. Reality.

If people don't like us for what we
are, there’s no sense in us fooling
them.

we get into trouble acaelling the school
for what it

it ds not to suggest at all that the
image is more important than the
gu f underneath.

What we are saying is that in all
ve its quest for real-being, something

rtant has been lost — something
which we need to relocate before it
i gone for good..

There is a word for it, and as back-
wards as it may seem for saying it,
the word is. pap nig nr and along
with it. goes a re word, pride.

There is somet! g incredibly wrong
with the way progress has been mis-
used and abused at Davidson.

It is evident in the lack of regard
for the Code of Responsibility. Whet-
her there are fallacies in the code
should not be the controlling factor
in behavior concerning it.

If there is something wrong with
it, change it. But it is wrong to dis-
regard it, to cast it off at will. The
privileges of the code —- the drinking,
the open dorms and the rest — im-
ply responsibility which, quite frank-
ly, has not been met.

Another responsibility which has
been quite childishly thrown out is
the responsnbility to one’s fellow stu-
dents. This is inherent in the free-
doms of the code.

Qpen dorms open the gate to par
ties, but not parties which are so loud
that they violate the right of “others

Laugh at the “Davidson gentleman”
tradition. At mes the phrase has in-
deed—_been—ridiculouswhen—used to
describe the actions of some students.

One need only look at the two
coarse and unnecessary~cheers at a
recent home basketball game to see
how childishness leads to “red-neck”
behavior and anything but the atti-
tude of the so-called gentleman.

There is sométhing “wrong with
this basig, attitude of indifference to-
ward others which seems to have be-
come so popular of late.

It is present — from fraternity ball-
ing sessions right on down the.volume
of a stereo — this lack of responsi-
bility.

If we are going to do away with the
image so as to expose the reality that

riles-ti

is Davidson, let’s not lose sight of the

basic rights and responsibilities which
the system grants and demands.

If there be any pride in the school,
any interest in the students, let it
manifest itself now — before decay
overwhelms it.

AN ANALYSIS

By STEVE CROSS
Asst. Copy Editor

As a part of the continu-
ing effort of higher educa-
tion to make itself relev-
ant to current problems in
the outside world, many col-
leges and universities
around the nation are adopt-
ing their curricula to offer
courses and programs in
ecological problems.

Many of these cources are

interdisciplinary. At the Uni-
versity of California at Ir-
vine, a 20-lecture course was
organized last year entitled
“Population! The Vital Re-
volution.’” The lectures were
given by faculty members,
community leaders,
cians, and students, who
analyzed the problem from
scientific, social, aesthetic,
and engineering angles.

Meanwhile, at San Diego

‘State College,’ a course in

“systems ecology’ has been

Three other North Caro-

a consortium to study eco-

Duke University, the Univer-

will exchange faculty mem-
bers, information, and facili-
ties, and they all plan ad-

basic assumptions.

They affect the character
of all that we do and all that
we plan to do in the area of
Black Studies. These are the
assumptions:

1, That ‘Black Studies is a
field still being born, This is
not to deny the existence of
significant, and often unap-
preciated, work related to
Black Studies that has al-
ready been done, but it does
deny the fact that.there is
any clear understanding of
the specific ways in which a
profound mining of the Black
experience challenges and
transforms the basic educa-
tinoal structures of the na-
tion.

2. That the establishing
and the defining of the field
of Black Studies stands log-
ically as a task and a chal-
lenge for Black people in
America and elsewhere. Oth-
ers may be called upon for
assistance, but the initiative
must be ours.

3. That the Center and its
counterparts on other cam-
puses are in an excellent po-
sition to play a central role
in defining the field and cre-
ating some of the models so
urgently required.

4. That a ‘unified, rather

tion of Black Studies is not

5. That a serious building
of this field is the task of
years, and hot a makeshift
program for a few persons
to do in several weeks or

Basic Program Elements:
1. Serious reseach in many

areas of historical and con-.

temporary Black existence
that have been either ignor-
ed, or, only superficially ex-
plored (e. g., Social Structure
in the Black Community.
Comparative Black Urban
Development in the New
World, Comparative Slav-
ery).

2. The encouragement of
those creative artists who
are searching for the mean-
ing of a Black aesthetic, who
are now trying to define and
build the basic ground out
of which Black creativity
may flow in the ‘arts.

3.Continuous research on
those contemporary political
economic, and social policies

the Black community in A-

‘Having critized the faculty in my last column be-

now be leveled at the students. :

Under the equal-time doctrine it’s only fair that
the columnist should pontificate on the sins of both
groups from his pedestal of perfection and wisdom.

But hedonistic or . it’s certainiy afflent. An
unscientific study estimptes that students here own
and maintain about three quarters of a million dol
lars worth of automobiles.

Not bad huh? That’s possible at a time when a
private institution provides them a most expensive,
individualized education with large.amounts of other
people's money.

But the affivence doesn’t stop with money. If
prestige and ego were quantifiable we should all be
millionaires. Unabashed smugness prevails with re-

to other schools, their students — “The guys

ve met always 400k down their noses at me because
I go to UNCC” ” Ah, the rewards of sloventy superiority
— praise be to brand names.

And what of the affluence of bigotry? A bigot
is “one obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his own
church, party, belief, or opinion.” A wealth of psy-
chic income involves from this stock: cry out against
“the red necks” (There’s a report out that they are
people, but students have effectively suppressed it.),
racists (freely defined and identified), capitalist: prof-
it mongers, cops, the South, the church, and now
even “establishment liberals.”

All this and the avowed concern for “humanity”
too.

There is currént in the student culture a tide of
self-proclaimed rightness about issues. In others we
would call it self-righteousness.

We demand a truism in ‘the nation’s foreign pol-
icy: “John, you're not going to the march in Washing-
ton? It’s gonna be a party — and the girls that go to
those things are really_up for it.”

Individuality: “Come on, everybody's going.”®

Anti-moralism: “Those middle class values are
really ——— up.” Or moralizing in the defense of your
own moralism is not moralism.

Somebody said it, “The more things change the
more they stay the same.”

So where's the generation ‘gap? So where's the

“student revolution?” There may be a sti ude “nt revolt
