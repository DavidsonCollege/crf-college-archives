VOL. LVI

A new work-study program
that will double the college's an-
nual spending on student em-
ployment is now in operation.

The new program, sponsored
jointly by Davidson and the U.
S. Department of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare (HEW), is
providing empioyment for some
100 students in addition to those
already holding regular jobs.

Ninety per cent of the pro-
gram's funds come from a one-
year (renewable) federal grant
of $45,000 approved by HEW Jast
spring. -

The College will finance the
other 10 per cent this year, in
addition to maintaining the old
student work program at an an-
nual cost of about $33,000. Next
year the College will provide
25 per cent.

Under the federal guidelines,
HEW will furnish $35,000 for on-

Over Crowded Parking

The Bursar’s Office reports that
only eight of the 368 permits
purchased have been bought by
freshmen.

Jim Terry, assistant dean of
students, advised that all stu-
dents read the traffic handbook
carefully to prevent fines for
careless mistakes. He request-
ed that all pay particular atten-
tion to article (5) of section b
which gives instructions. for
bring:ng cars to the campus for
only a brief period of time.
“This,” Terry pointed out, "‘is
one of the most frequently vio-
lated regulations and results in
a ten dollar fine.”” For other vio-
‘lations, the initial fine is one
dollar: for all other fines or for
misssing traffic court. the fine
is three dollars.

Burts reported that 368 park-

the Bursar’s Office so far this
year. He also indicated that in
a survey made about two years
ago, it was learned that there
were between 500 and 600 spaces
open to students.

Burts addded that at one time
last year, the number of issued

there were never 630 cars on

Council To Share
Funds With Union

The Davidson College Social
Council has allocated one third
of its funds for this year to the
Union Social Committee.

Vince Foster, Social Council
President, reported that the
Social Council gave the Union
$9000.

According to Foster, the pur-
pose of this relocation of funds
is to ‘allow the Union to plan
and finance social activities for
non-dance and non-concert week-
ends.”

The Union financed the fresh-
man mixer with Converse Col-
lege.

The Social Council, however,
will still have control over con-
cert and dance weekends. The
first concert weekend is October
1 when Ian and Sylvia are fea-
tured entertainers.

When questioned about a pos-
sible merger between the Union
and the Social Council, Foster
said that ‘‘the idea has been
discussed.” But he emphasized
that ‘certainly vothing official
has been decided.”

NUMBER TWO

‘Spot Box’ Urged
For Student Body

Getting off to an auspicious start, the Student Coun-
cil meeting Monday was marked by three improvements
over recent years: organization, spirit, and interesting
ideas. . ;

Two proposals were especially impressive, one being
a Davidson-Charlotte bus sponsored by the Council, and a

student-wide “spot box” being the second.
The bus, brought up by Coun-

cil President Chuck Matthews, is
intended to help solve the obvi-
ous socia) dilemma faced by
many students, especially fresh-
men. Matthews reported that
several faculty members and a
great many students regard the
social problem at Davidson as
‘the worst thing here.”

If the proposal could be work-
ed out, the bus would run on a
scheduled basis, especially on
‘the weekends, with stops at
Queens and a downtown loca-
tion. This could solve the trans-
portation problem faced by the
many students without cars. The
bus could also help for basket-
ball games in Charlotte.

Matthews pointed out, howev-
‘er, that many problems would
have to be worked out, primar-
ily getting a bus. Insurance,
drivers. and an equitable way
to decide who should travel
would be other problems.

It was suggested that the coun-
cil work with the Freshman
Council on the project, with
Johnny Gresham in charge.

The “‘spot box.’’. proposed by
junior councilman Bill Watson.
would be placed in book form at
a central location. ideally the
library. Watson related that a
similar process is in effect at
Georgia Tech.

Vespers
Alternative
Sought

The Religious Life Committee
is scheduled to meet today to
discuss the opportunities for
worship which should be made
available to the college com-
munity.

This meeting will be a follow-
up of the committee's decision
last spring to suspend compul-
sory vespers for a two-year trial
period.

Will Terry, pastor of the Col-
lege Church, expressed his de-
sire to get away from consid-
ering what the committee pro-
poses as simply a substitute for
the vespers program.

“This is an entirely new ap-
proach and method,” he explain-
ed, ‘to provide an opportunity
for students and faculty to wor-
ship. It was evident that the old
way was not doing the job.”

Another area of discussion at
the meeting will concern facul-
ty open houses on Sunday nights.
Formerly, a certain number of
faculty homes were open for stu-
dent visitation immediately fol-
lowing vespers. Terry indicated
that a solution to this question
would also be sought.

Watson pointed out that’ there
is about one-half the student
body not having access to
“spots’’ (ie. reviews and ex-
ams from past. years). “The
spots are in most of the frater-
nity houses."’ Watson said, ‘‘and
therefore freshmen and inde-
pendents are at a disadvantage.”

The council also agreed that
a studentwide spot box cotld
help improve the caliber of ‘a
professor's reviews by forcing
him to think up/new or differ-
ent questions.

Watson pointed out that a pro-
fessor probably could not be
forced to give copies of reviews
to the “spot box.’’ but several:
professors had already approved
of the system, The ‘'spot box"

tion. There was a small surplus
left from last. year.

Mike Booe. IFC president, an-
nounced the delay of the IFC re-
treat until spring odecause of
lack of planning time and the
cancellation. of a speaker. He
said that “two weeks seemed
like an awful short. time’ to

Booe also announced the ap-
pointment of Jim McNair to the
Judicial Board. and suggested
the Board meet for a dry run
of its procedure before any
cases come up.

In other business. the council
set forth their aims in several
areas, withthe -investigation of

ic scheduling, social and recrea-
tlonal facilities, and studen: gov-

objectives.
