The Wildcats evened their season record at 2-2 with a 49-13 victory over Pres-

(The After}

DEAR SPORTS ILLUSTRATED:

You did it again last week. Once again the infamous
Sports IMustrated jinx, which strikes terror in the hearts
of coaches and sports information directors alike, struck.
This time it was Joe Willie Namath, “the biggest thing in
New York since Babe Ruth,” to quote Billy Sullivan,
owner of the Boston Patriots.

Before we examine the disaster wrought last Sunday
at Houston, let us examine the highlights of the SI jinx,
which reads like the path of a tornado. .

Just about this time in 1964, the St. Louis Cardinals
of the NFL were sailing along on the arm of quarterback
Charlie Johnson and faced a tough game with the Cleve-
land Browns, a game which would go a long way toward
determining the Eastern Division champ. Well, you ran a
nice story telling everyone how good the Cardinals were
and how they ought to win the division crown without
working up a sweat.

What happened? The Cardinals lost to the Browns.
Then they lost again. And again and again and again. In
fact St. Louis lost so many games after you put the jinx
on them that they barely finished at the .500 mark.

You say that is just an isolated case. My next piece
of incriminating evidence concerns a small Presbyterian
college for men which had a pretty good basketball team.
But they weren’t so good to rate being ranked number
one in the nation. Why, their own coach, who was al-
ways pessimistic, went a step further, guessing they might
not win but five games.

But you really thought this school was the living end. «

It was almost the living end for Davidson College when
Sports Wlustrated listed them as number one in the na-
tion. The students were dumbfounded, Lefty scoffed at
it and SI became number one on the hit parade at David-
son. more coveted than dexes.

Nevertheless the jinx was at work. We had already
beaten Wake Forest, but just ‘two days after that in-
famous prediction appeared at the Hub, Davidson was
mauled by St. Joseph’s. We were killed. The Sports II-
lustrated kiss-of-death had struck again without mercy.

_ There are more recent incidents which lowered your
subscription total each time. How about that cover pic-
ture of the Astros’ Joe Morgan and Sonnv Jackson? The
Astros were in third place that week. Next week they
were on their way back to Metsville—the cellar.

Your latest application of the jinx was unforgivable,
except in Texas. The Jets had already bombed the Oilers
in New York a few weeks ago and they were favorites to
do so again—until Thursday when SI came out. The jinx!
Could it happen to a red-blooded American boy like Joe

Willie? It could. New York was murdered. Namath threw -

ROUT CMA,

four interceptions and ancient George Blanda acted like
he had founded the fountain of youth.

_ Which brings us to the main point of our letter. Bas-
ketball is coming up soon. We‘know how you like the ivy
walls of our institution. We could have a very good team.
Lefty is being a good guy this year. He spoke to a group
of freshmen the other night and not just to find a man-
ager or a cameraman. The situation is ripe for you to
pick us high in your preseason polls. PLEASE DON'T
PICK ON US AGAIN THIS YEAR!

Would you believe we finally won a Southern Con-
ference tournament? We made a lot of progress last year
just being ‘The Best of the Rest.” We may have a better
basketball team this year. We finally have a shooting
guard and slick Rod will again terrorize teams with his
blinding moves.

It would be nice to be mentioned favorably in your
basketball issue. We would appreciate that. Johnny Kilgo
would get paid. Somebody might show up for the Wake
Forest game this year. But don’t go overboard. Pick UC-
LA and a lot of other good teams ahead of us and then
mention us. It’s not that we are ingrates, we just don’t
want to get jinxed again this year.

IMAC ON RISE

One of the brighter spots of this fall at Davidson has
been the emergence of the Intramural Athletic Council
into something more than just a Monday night meeting
and a picture in the annual.

Some of this improvement can be attributed to the
Athletic Department and new Intramural Director Ster-
ling Martin. For the first time in countless years, there
has been someone in the Athletic Department interested
in intramurals.

But the main cause of the effectiveness of the IMAC
is the hard work put forth by its president, Jack Sher-
rill. Simple little things like renumbering the fields in
some semblance of order, furnishing THE DAVIDSON-
‘IAN with standings, leaving the schedule on a basis flex-
ible enough to work around the weather and announcing,
tournaments for the minor sports well in advance to pro-
mote at least a little effort to get in shape for wrestling
by someone besides the Phi Delts have made this year’s
intramural program potentially the best in many years.

“They were really fired up for
the game,”’ said quarterback
Jimmy Poole, “and they wanted
to beat us as much as anybody.”

However, Poole’s consistent.
passing and Billy Taylor's pow-
erful running proved too much
for the Blue Hose. ‘‘Poole’s ac-
curate passing and good block-
ing by the interior linemen en-
abled us to establish a good run-.
ning game,"’ Coach Homer Smith
said. ‘Several different pass for-
mations were successful in loos-
ening up the PC defense.”

‘We concentrated on option
plans in the first quarter,”
Smith said, ‘‘and then passes in
the second. and inside runs for
the remainder of the game.”

‘A flood pass to the right ‘side
worked well,"” Poole said, ‘be-
cause they could never cover the
tight_end. We knew the pass

plays but that we wanted to es-

ball and the only reason Poole

Smith praised the defensive
line which he said ‘gave up few
first downs after the first quar-
ter." However, he noted that
“the team let up late in the
game and you should never do
that.”

But he added, ‘‘] was pleased

St. Clair Paces Whittlemen

Barry St. Clair, Davidson's
cross-country captain, led the
thinclads to a whopping 19-43
win over St. Andrews Wednes-
day on the Davidson course.

St. Clair broke his own four
mile course record of 21:59 with
a time of 21:54. In spite of the
cool, damp air the Davidson
team made an outstanding show-
ing. Besides St. Clair’s first,
Mike Moats, Randy Phillips, Jim
Wall, Bill Hearn and Fred Low-
rance went on to take the third
through seventh positions. Only
a second by Joe Smith of St. An-
drews broke up the Davidson
combination.

The Harriers turned in an-
other strong showing against the

~ Furman thinclads at Greenville,

S. C. last Friday. Furman, 12th
in the nation last year, defeated
the *Cats 22-33. Coach Heath
Whittle commented, ‘'This was
a real good showing against such
a strong team. They had three
boys back from their last-year's
conference champions."’ Horace
Poole and Jack Daniels of Fur-
man came in first and second
while St. Clair, Moats and Phil-
lips placed third, fifth and sixth
over the four-mile course.

Davidson's harriers next meet
VMI and East Carolina in a tri-
angular meet at Lexington, Va.
Wednesday.

The frosh thinclads ran their
record to 5-1 with a close 28-29
win over Myers Park Tuesday.

John Puckett of Davidson, in a

meet that was held in a cold

gainst St. Andrews, 19-43

‘rain, finished first with a time
of 10:17 for the two mile David-
son course. Gerald Forrester and
Willie Wilson of Myers Park
took second and third. Dan Herd,
Allan Pusey and James Puckett
of Davidson came in fifth, sixth
and seventh. The freshmen also
scored a 26-33 win over the Fur-
man frosh last Friday. The

whole team put in a strong per-|'

formance for the victory. They
were led by John Puckett, who
placed first. .

The junior harriers next took

day, one of the strongest teams
they will meet this year, Whit-

‘Kittens Display Improvement

By JOHN HUGGINS
Sports Writer

Elaborating on the Wild-
kittens’ 17-7 victory over
Carolina Military Academy
last Saturday, Assistant
Coach Dick Short said, “We
added some variations to the
defense and worked hard
on our offensive running at-
tack. Apparently it paid
off.”

“The pass defense did a good
job in the second half.” Short
said. “Lynn Himes, Mike Cul-
breth and David Branch helped
by putting a good rush on the
passer. The pass blocking was
so good that they got to our
passer only once in the 20 times
we attempted to pass.’’

The Cadets, playing before
their homecoming crowd, re-
ceived the opening kickoff but
were held by the ‘Kittens’ de-
fense. CMA then punted to the
Davidson 28. The Wildkitten. of-
fense took over and muscled its
way 72 yards down the field to
give Davidson a 7-0 lead.

After the Wildkittens’ first
touchdown, both defensive units
held firm until the Cadets’ pass-

| ing attack began to click late in

the second quarter. They got to
the Davidson 21 by connecting
on a series of short passes and

scored on a long pass deep into
the end zone.

After intercepting a Davidson
pass, the Cadets were again on
the move. Short passes, a pen-
alty and a bomb put CMA on
the Davidson one yard line. But
the hard-hitting Wildkitten de-
fense knocked the ball loose on
the next play and Allen Hawkins
pounced on it to halt the Ca-
dets’ threat seconds before the
end of the first half.

In the third quarter, the of-
fenses were stalled while David.
son gained some field position
by Terry Esterkamps’ booming
punts. Davidson's only threat
was a long Hampton-to-Hannen
pass called back by a holding
penalty. Whit Morrow intercept-
ed a CMA pass at the end of the

third quarter. In Davidson's en-
suing drive, John Zaharov's
tackle-bursting 15-yard run set
up Ed Terry's field goal from
the CMA 20 yard line, which put
Davidson ahead, 10-7.

Later in the fourth quarter
Davidson’s defense forced CMA
to punt from their end zone. Es-
terkamp and Neal Dettmering
partially blocked the punt. Four
plays afterwards, in a fourth-
and-seven situation, Himes made
a catch between two defenders
to get the first down. The next
play Hampton hit Hannen with
a 26-yard scoring pass. Terry's
PAT made it Davidson by 17-7.
With time running out, Ester-
kamp intercepted a CMA pass
and the Wildkittens ran out the
clock.

Short said of the Wildkittens’
Oct. :28 game, ‘‘N.C. State has a
really tough team with good per-
sonnel. It ranks with Duke's.
We have improved a great deal
and I am sure our best effort
can win the game.”

There were many outstanding

performances by Wildkitten play-
ers last Saturday. Mike Kelly
caught four passes for 32 yards.
Hannen had four for 61 yards.
Hampton did most of the pass-
ing and ran for 48 yards on nine
carries. Zaharov gained a whop-

weren't stopping anything we
ran," he said. ;
John Kilgo, sports information
director, said, ‘Billy is most ef-
fective on fullback runs straight
into the line. He kicks, squirms
and jumps for those extra
yards.”

Taylor's longest run of the day
was an 18-yard gain. A 33-yard
ramble was called back because
of a penalty.

In the East Carolina game,
Taylor, playing at tailback.
broke Pete Glidewell’s pass-re-
ceiying- record by snagging 10.
passes, mostly on swing pat-
terns.

Taylor moved from his tail-
back position to fullback because
Kerry Keith sustained a pulled
muscle. He is also slated to start
at fullback against Richmond to-
morrow night in Richmond.

Describing Taylor's play
against Presbyterian, Smith said,
“This is the kind of performance
we will need to have a good sea-
son. More boys will be called
upon to play positions somewhat’
news to them, and I only hope
that they do as well as Billy
did.”’

Looking back on the game,
Taylor jokingly said, ‘I was glad
we won because I had heard that
we might have to practice when
we got back if we lost. I also
wanted to get back to see my
girlfriend.”’

Viewing the remainder of the
schedule, Taylor said, ‘‘I hope ,
we won't lose another game. I
think we are better than any- -
body else we play. We have im.
proved tremendously this year.
Our offense is much stronger
this season, and Jimmy Poole
is doing a great job.”
