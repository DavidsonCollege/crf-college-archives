Organized By Students

Executive Committee Elected.

Davidson has entered upon a new
era in her history. ‘he institution ts
going to grow in numbers, in quality,
and in college spirit.

Last Saturday morning the Greater
Davidson Club was officialy organized.
J. H. Miller, the president of our stu-
dent body, outlined the object and aims
of the club. It is to be composed of
every member of the student and the
host of loyal Davidson alumni, who are
scattered throughout the country, [t
has three essential functions, First, it
is to get the men on the campus closer
together, It is to make every man feel
that he is a part of a great machine
working fOr the best interests of the col-
lege, and that he must do his part if
Davidson is to be the best.

The second object. of the club is to
help the college grow in numbers. Each
man will return with at least one new
student with him. ‘he job of getting
new men is no longer the work of the
college officials, but. each student will
be allowed to help in this work. And
last of all the club is to keep the alumni
in closer couch with the present student
body and their Alma Mater.

‘The president of the athletic associa-
tion, R. R. Clark, emphasized the need
of such a club and moved that it be or-
ganized. ‘he motion was seconded by
J. R. Boswell and short speeches were
made by Woods, McArn, McAskill,
Roberts: and Schenck. The motion was
then voted upon and unanimously pass-
ed. The name agreed upon was “Phe
Greater Davidson Chub.”

After some discussion it was decided
that the president of the student body
should be the president of the club*and
that the executive committee should be
composed of the presidents and one rep-
resentative from cach class. .

After a resolution asking Dr. Mac-
Connell and Coach Fetzer to speak to
the club at an carly date was adopted,
the first meeting of the Greater David-
son Club adjourned.

The class representatives who were
elected after the club adjourned were
Clark, 't9, Roberts, ‘20, McCaskill, J.
C., ’21 and McFadden, J. M., ‘22.
‘These men are to serve with their class
presidents on the executive committee
of the Greater Davidson Club.

THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND
EYES.

(Said to be the most perfect short poem
in the English language.)
The night has a thousand eyes,
The day but one;
Yet the light of the bright world dies
With the dying sun.
The mind has a thousand eyes,
And the heart but one;
Yet the light of a whole life dies
When love is done.
—Francis Bourdillon.

TOUGH, INDEED.
Employe—“T would like more salary.
Iam going to marry.”
Employer—“‘Sorry, ebut I'll have to
reduce it. I am going to get married
myself.”"—Sydney Post.

A COLORFUL ODE.
He kissed her on the cheek,
It seemed a harmless frolic;
He's been laid up for a week,
They say with painter's colic.
—Exchange.

There’s a meter of measure and a meter
in verse, .
And each is a useful one;
But under a silver moon, to “meter—”
Well, that is second to none.

Greater Davidsonian Planned. Out-
look Prosperous.

While a number of fellows were giv-
ing proof of their glee because of the
holiday on Wednesday a group of mas-
ter minds wdrq: gathered around the
festal board to celebrate the close of Da-
vidsonian's best year. Lt is hoped that
all understand that not only their men-
tal capacities were being treated to goud
things. ‘Io remove any doubt about it
let it be said that they started off on a
salad course, including the everpresent
“hot dogs.” Drinks, sandwiches and
oranges were next offered to their dain-
ty palates, after which ice cream, the
Neapolitan kind, in double portions and
homemade cake were greatly enjoyed.
All wete duly shocked when the minis-
terials “lit up” with the others on the
smokes. Peanuts and jokes were cracked
for the remainder of the evening, with
EK, A, Woods acting as toastmaster.
Plans for next year and criticisms of the
past were made for the Davidsonian. Its
outlook for the future seems very prom-
ising. indeed with the able corps of edi-
tors which will be here in the coming
session,

MR. MILES MADE TALK
AT WORLD FORUM

At the regular meeting of the world
forum last ‘Thursday night Mr. Miles
made a very interesting and inspiring
talk on “The Call of the World's Pres-
ent Need.”

The next study will be the fifth chap-
ter in “The Call of a World Task.”
Every student is urged to come to these
meetings every Thursday evening. ‘The
course of study that is being pursued is
one of vital interest to every man today.
You do not know what benefit and in-
spiration you are missing until you at-
tend these meetings. Be on hand next
meeting and show that you are back of
the “¥” in this work.

$0 IT IS.

I shot an arrow into the air;

It fell in distance 1 knew not where

Till a neighbor said that I killed his
calf—

And I had to pay him six and a half.

1 bought some poison to kill some rats

And a neighbor swore it killed his cats,

And rather than argue across the fence,

I paid him four dollars and fifty cents.

One night I sat sailing a toy balloon

And hoped that it would soar till it
reached the moon;

But the candle it fell on a farmer's straw

And he said I must settle or go to-law;

And that is the way with random shot

It never hit the proper spot,

And a joke you spring that you think so
smart:

May leave a wound in some
heart.—-Exchange.

SENSITIVE.

Assistant (to old lady who has handed
in a badly spelled telegram)—‘What's

it’s none of your business. They'll know

characterized the boys’ attempt at a base-
ball game Saturday. Not “the battle of
the mounds,” mind you for the pitch-
ing was rotten, the support more rotten
and the batting, well, there wasn't any
batting to speak of. However, with
Stone, Hall and Love lined up against
Black, Key and Craig, truly the contest
put on a grammatical flavor.

‘Thomas, who started (not starred) in
the box for the Juniors, seemed to have
had the correct idea as to the way of

preventing his opponents from hitting the} § p

ball, i. ¢., to keep it away from the plate.
He kept it way away too, When acci-
dentially he threw one in the vicinity of
the base the batter managed to be hit
with it. ‘Ihe Seniors are to be con-
gratulated on their self-control and nev-
er was an unladylike utterance made
when they were hit by the ball. In ‘fact,
their psuedo efforts at dodging reminded
one of the attempts of sweet sixteen to
prevent being kissed, You all understand,
of course.

Brady, behind the bat, presided over
the destinies of missed strikes and skip
fouls for the Juniors, Key played first
in a true Chesterfield fashion, while
Lacy McAlister stopped everything that
did not get through him at second and
graceful Bob Black claimed third as his
post. ‘There were three outfilders.  ;

For the class of ‘19° Charlie Wilson
and String Bean McCaskill did most of
the handling of the ball, “Heart's De-
sire’ Love did receiving at first. ‘*Peb-
ble” Stone was a tower of weakness at
the midway station. Turner probably
played his last game at short as he will
more than likely be ruled out. He was
too good, Leighton McKeithen showed
wonderful talents for railroad work by
his flagging of flies in left field. General
Hall, of “The Lost Squad” (See Capt.
Harris for particulars), tented in cen-
ter half of cach inning. here is a move-
ment to rule out spiked shoes and thus
make the “Diamond safe for tennis
shoes.”

‘The score was 9 to 8 in favor of the
Seniors. (‘This last is added for the ben-
efit of the curious, not that it really
makes any difference).

WANTED IT ALL.

The customer picked up the
from the counter and handed it to the
butcher, with a friendy smile. “I don’t
really want it,” he said, “but if you will
cut it off [ will take it along with the
rest.” ;

“Cut what off?’ demanded the butch-
er in blank surprise.

“Your hand,” was the gentle reply.
“You weighted it with the sausage, and
I like to get what | pay for.”—Tit-Bits.

“What kind of a college would this col-
lege be,
If all its members were just like me”
