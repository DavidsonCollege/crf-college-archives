Jackson clarifies stance on National

By BILL BARNES
News Editor

Assistant Professor of Art Herb
Jackson confirmed that the 1976
Davidson National Print and
Drawing Competition will be the last
under his direction. Jackson feels that
he can no longer run the National
under the present circumstances. Nor
does he want to.

There seems to be a certain interest
in keeping the National at Davidson.
“But,’’ said Jackson, “the. College
only seems to want to keep it insofar
as it’s not a major expense. The
school would be happy to keep it
under its past circumstances.”

“The College doesn’t need to keep
the National,”’ said Jackson, ‘‘But we
are known in every state in the union
and the show brings culture here we
otherwise wouldn’t have. It brings
people, and it’s a benefit to the

College, the community, and the

great community of artists in
general.”

One of Jackson’s reasons for
- ceasing to administrate the National

is that is takes too much time out of .

both his teaching and his work as an
artist. Jackson estimates that he
spends 1200 hours a year working on
the exhibition, a job which includes
packing and repacking each show,
gathering sponsors, cataloguing
entries, accepting and rejecting
entries, finding a juror, and a mass of
correspondence. ‘There are people
who would consider administering the
National a full-time job,’’ said
Jackson.

Jackson feels that the amount of
work he puts into the National affects
his other pursuits. His painting
suffers becuase he cannot spend as
much time in his studio as he wishes
to, while his classes suffer because he
has less time to devote to teaching.

There has been speculation as to
why it is necessary tor a professional
art person to run the National.
According to Jackson, there are

Honors deanship changes,
Avinger to contro! Center

By LYMAN COLLINS
Assistant News Editor

On March 1, Dr. Earl R.
MacCormac, Professor of Phi-
losophy and Dean of the
Honors Center, will rotate out
of his position as dean. He will
be replaced by Dr. Robert L.
Avinger Jr., Professor of Eco-
nomics who will serve for a
three year term.

“The decision was made
through a series of negotia-
tions between the Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs and
the department chairman,”’
explained MacCormac. »

The dean, and all professors

in the Honors Center, are -

chosen for two or three year
terms after which they rotate
out.

““At the end of the Spring
term Professors Proctor, Pat-
terson, and Bliss will rotate
out,’ said MacCormac.

While in the Honors Center,
professors, who are required
by the college to teach at least
six courses a year, teach three
regular courses in their de-
partments and at least three
courses in the Honors Center.

Those in the Honors Center
include at least: one seminar,
one series of tutorials, and one
research-independent study
project.

‘‘When I came into the
program three years ago, I
wanted to insure and maintain

high academic standards in all.

areas,” said MacCormac.

‘Also, I wanted. the honors °

student to be consistent with a

liberal education. We are just
beginning to build a good
relationship with department-
al honors,” he continued.
“We've had a particularly
happy relationship with the
history department, as well as
the biology department.”
Incoming Dean Avinger ex-
plained that while he had not
really gotten into the mech-
anics of the Honors Center as
yet he did see his major

emphasis.

“IT see in addition to what’s
going on now more inter-dis-
ciplinary. work. It would most-
ly include stuff in social sci-
ences and humanities and
somevhard science but I’m not
trained in that stuff.

[see AVINGER, page 3]

You’ve got to set a limit

somewhere.

“Not allowing anyone other
than a student under eighteen
into the room unless they are
with their parents is one way
of doing this.”

“There is a drinking prob-
lem on this entire campus,”’
said Mayer. ‘‘Wherever: we
are, as the Union, serving
wine or beer, there’s always
the worry, backed by exper-
ience, that someone will get
very messed up and create
some problems for us and
themselves.

‘‘We do not have nor do we
want bouncers. Instead, we
assume that students will
have enough control to know
when they are inebriated, to
know when they are causing a
hassle and to remove them-
selves,”’ said Meyer.

Scott.-noted that students

know when to leave, but that
he has more trouble- with
people who are not associated
with the College.

Union Director C.. Shaw.

Smith is against the use of
mealtickets for beer purchases
at the bar. He sees this as a
matter of the trustees’ stipula-

no” to meal tickets for beer

tion that the 900 Room pro- -
vide, but not encourage, beer
sales. Smith would, however,
favor lower beer prices.

Mayer is in favor of using
meal tickets to purchase beer.
“‘T’d love it,’’ he said. ‘‘A
student could go out and buy
‘meal tickets for less than face
value and spend them on beer.
But as a part of the Union it
would complicate things.”’

Scott sees ‘‘no way”’ for
meal tickets to be used as
tender at the bar.

The principal reason why
meal tickets are not used for
beer and sandwich sales in the
900 Room is expense to the
freshmen. At present, the 900
Room is self-supporting, as
are the other food service
outlets on campus. The Food
Serice is based on income from "
the mealtickets, the Snack
Bar, special functions and the
two eating houses.

Eliminating cash in the 900
Room would cause an increase
in prices to meal ticket hold-
ers, according to Scott, who.
also sees his position as one of
trying to provide beer and
sandwiches in the bar, as
opposed to essentials.
