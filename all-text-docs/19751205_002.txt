North Carolina Governor
James E. Holshouser Jr. took
a break from his busy schedule
here Monday to watch. his
alma mater in its annual
basketball competition with
Wofford College.

“You know I was fortunate
to make it to the opener
tonight. We were in the area to
open the new eight-mile
stretch of Interstate 77 this
afternoon,’’ remarked the
Governor.

This new section of the
Interstate extends from the
Northwest Expressway to
Reames Road (one road north
of North Mecklenburg High
School).

“We look to the completion
of I77 by the spring and
expect the highway to stretch
from South Carolina to Vir-
ginia by late 1976 or early
1977,” stated Holshouser.

In addition to his duties as
Governor, Holshouser has as-
sumed the responsibilities of
managing President Gerald
Ford’s southeastern campaign
for the presidency.

“T was happy to take on this
position. I think the President
is the right man for the job. I
think the country’s very for-
tunate that he was the man in
the Vice-President’s office”’
when former President Rich-
ard Nixon resigned.

Foul dumpsters block court pathway

An object of concern for
students walking between
Bailey and Richards Houses
has been the placement of
dumpster trash containers
near the sidewalk to Patterson
Court.

Ron Scott, director of ARA
Food Services, is upset about
the dumpsters.

“That thing stinks, and I
don’t like it one bit,’’ said
Scott. ‘The college brought
these things in here without
consulting me and the dump-
sters are causi ig problems.

‘They stink because they
need: to be cleaned. The com-
pany that picks them up was
supposed to clean them too,
but they haven’t, so we will
have to get in there and do the
job.

“Another thing, they aren’t
big enough to handle all out
trash.”’

Scott also commented on
the college priorities. ‘‘If
Davidson can spend high
sums making sure the leaves
are off the grass. and all the
limbs are the right height, it
seems like they would worry
about the aesthetics of these
dumpsters.

one student attempted to tow

the dumpsters to a different
site.

“Of course the best situa-
tion would be what we had last
year with daily pick ups. If the
dumpsters could be dumped
and cleaned every day it would
not be so bad, but it is emptied
only twice a week,’’ said Scott.
‘‘My suggestion is to build
concrete pads behind the

“Yet they are spread out all houses to sit the dumpsters

around the court. Last year we
had a truck and daily trash
pick up but even that is gone.”’

The problem has gotten to
the point where many stu-
dents have taken the situation
into their own hands. Recently

The Governor was critical of
the several announced Demo-
cratic presidential candidates.
“You don’t get a feeling for
any strong sense of momen-
tum going for any of them.
They (the Democratic Party)
don’t have a candidate who’s
captured the imagination of
the electorate.

“We do. The people know
the President is open and
candid. He has restored public
faith in the White House.

Holshouser, speaking of two
of the Democratic candidates,
said, “I don’t think Sanford
has yet established credibility
among constituents. Carter
began with the same problem
but is starting to overcome
that.’”’

The Governor also remarked
that he did not view the
candidacy of Ronald Reagan
as a serious threat to the
President in his bid for re-
election.

“In 1974 less than fourty
percent of the people went to
the polls. I’m scared to death
we may give up.

“Yet I’m encouraged when I
look at many of our nation’s
young adults. I’m interested
in encouraging more young
people to take an interest in
politics and get involved.
