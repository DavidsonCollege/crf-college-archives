... Security returns Watts card+locks

(Continued from page 1)

three incidents in Watts last
year the administration felt all
precautions were necessary.

‘Many people are under the
impression that Davidson’
College is atypical of college
communities--that is, that we
have no problem with the town.
This is not true, and this is the
only reason the locks were put
on the doors.”’

Last summer Stone surveyed
the security systems at
Williams, Duke, and Chapel
Hill. She found Duke’s security
system which involves the card-
lock doors the most satisfactory
because it is ‘‘completely
student controlled.”

The. committee decided to
adopt the system after a report
on the Duke arrangement was
presented to it last summer.

Terry stated, ‘‘The card-lock
system was chosen because it is
the least offensive, the most
easily adaptable if cards are
lost, and requires no extra per-
sonnel.”

Although the doors are not
presently functioning, the

“It is my guess it (the card-
lock doors) will be put back on
in the summer.”’

indicated that the future of the
card-lock doors was not their
decision. Nicolls stated, ‘‘I don’t

know anything about future.

plans for the doors.’”’ I’ve heard
nothing since the original meet-
ng last summer.”’

The card-lock doors were sup-
posed to have been installed
before students returned. in
September, but due to what
Stone termed ‘‘poor com-
munication between Meetze’s
and the dean’s office,’ in-
stallation was delayed.

Under the card-lock system,
women in Watts are issued key-
cards, that will unlock the door
when inserted into a slot in the
door. The door relocks
automatically when closed.
Each woman student in Watts is
charged $1 for her card which is
refundable upon return at the
end of the year. Lost cards cost

$5 to replace.

If large numbers of cards are
lost or stolen such that the dorm
is no longer secure, the dean
can collect all cards, change the
mechanism in the .door and

- issue new ones at no charge.

Cards have only the manufac-
turer’s address on them and a
number. There is no in-
formation that would give
anyone who didn’t already
know a clue as to what door it
opened.

During vacations, the lock-
mechanisms on the doors are
altered so students can’t unlock
the daors. Changing the
mechanism does not require the
removal of the locks; security
personnel can easily adjust the
mechanisms and change the
magnetic field.

The card-lock doors operated
for. less that a week in winter
term before the locks were
removed by students. Stone
caaled this an “immature way
to deal with the problem.”’ She
feels certain that the doors were
removed by students not
residing in Watts.

“It’s not a problem with the
freshmen. They are used to
restrictions from home,’’ she
stated. First floor Wats

The screens were installed on
1st floor Watts windows for
‘total security’. according to
Stone. ‘“‘What is the point of
locking the door if someone can
come in the window?’’ com-
mented Stone. ‘It’s just a
question of whether it’s con-
venient or easy for someone to
climb in the window. Someone
might do it for a prank and wind
up in serious trouble.’’

Stone is aware that the
screens can be removed from
the outside, but, she stated,
‘*‘You’d have to do some work
getting it off and chances are
somebody would see you.’’

Stone readily admits that the
time the door is to be locked at
night is completely arbitrary,
and-that the card-lock doors are

no more effective that the
women locking thier own doors.
‘However, ’’ she said, ‘“‘you

suffer unpleasant consequences
if they don’t.’’

Stone indicated
doors are not put
because the men on first floor
are ‘adequate se: urity.”’ The
same method is not adopted for
Watts due to ‘‘parents’ ob-
jections,’’. according to Stone.
She stated that if there were no
men in Little and the co lege
followed a consistent security
policy, card-lock doors would
have to be installe«,

The administration is aware
of the resolution passed by the
SGA a little over a month ago
which requested that ‘David-
son College not re-install the
card-locks on Watts dorm, and
that the College remove the
screens from first floor.”

‘Every supervisor we have
here is a trainer and instructor.
We’ve trained everybody we
have here,’’ said Meetze.

‘Now it is true that we don’t
have a classroom training
program, but if we did, we
wouldn’t get any work done. We
offer on-the-job training.”’

According to Meetze, any em-
ployee who gains admission to
Central Piedmont. Community

is: entitled to receive com-
pensation to cover his tuition
expenses.

“‘Several workers have taken
advantage of CPCC course .of-

ferings,’’ commented Meetze.

Several black employees said
that they had never been in-
formed of the opportunity to
take courses, all expenses paid,
at CPCC.

“Maybe they just. let the
semi-skilled and __ skilled
workers in on that deal, but no
one never told‘us about that,”
said one employee.

“How can we learn a skill if
we is not trained, and given the
chance to get some training in a
school?” ee another em-
ployee.

According to Meetze, ‘‘Some
workers don’t want to’advance,
and so they never take ad-
vantage of the training options
which we provide.”’
