It’s nice to see Coach Dole smile again.

When I walked out on Richardson Field last Monday
where he had fourteen of the fifteen boys that played
against Citadel working out, I found a cordial coach in-
stead of the moody mentor of the post-Catawba-pre- Cita-
del era.

J wanted a story and he was ready to give me one.
“The boys had an awful lot of desire. Fifteen of
them played the whole game. They were tired, and
like last year’s win over Wofford, this one can be
chalked up to desire.”

The coach complained a little about the game weath-;
er, and the slushing in his shoes when he was walking,!
but considering the outcome, I gathered that it hadn't!
worried him very much.

Coach Bitl Dole praised his

squad by what he deter-
mined a real “team effort.” |

SECOND HALF

The Bulldogs tame back hard
after halftime and late in the
third quarter culminated a long
march downfield with a short
plunge by halfback Tlemingway
tor the six-pointer. A ground
conversion was idttempted, but
was stopped cold by the stub-
born Wildcat line.

Then Davidson succeed-

from there big Dave War-
den crashed over for the
touchdown. Warden, who
had been converted from
‘fullback to the center posi-
tion at the first of this sea-

usual feat in this day and age.

“We passed four times on our first drive and
completed two of them, but the ball got too slippery
to throw so we went to the belly series. The straight
stuff won the ball game for us.”

Warden shouldered most of the load on the touch-
down drive, gaining about six yards almost every time
he carried the ball. The coach plans to alternate Warden},

and hard running George Hart at offensive fullback and
use Warden on defense at linebacker.

Dole addéd that even though power football won the
Citadel game. he was going to use his pro type offense

against P.C. “We'll use what works.’ he said.

HOUSE-WESTERVELT

I asked about the House-Westervelt battle for end.
“House did an awfully good job last week. He may
start again in place of Westervelt if we receive. Westy

will probably start if we kick.”

When quizzed about P.C., he answered, ‘‘Presbyte-
rian has the best team they've had in my seven years at
Davidson. They’ve probably got the best offense of any

team we'll play this year.”

As I left, Dole was grinning as he watched his
fourteen stalwarts running signals up and down the
field, full of pep and shouting, “Beat Presbyterian.”

Yep. it’s nice to see the coach smiling. I hope the

events of the morrow will

Cats Boast Versatile
Backtield Ensemble

By “B” MILLNER

Coach Bill Dole has selected a highly diversified
backfield to execute his much publicized razzle-dazzle

1958 model offense.

This versatile group
boasts an old-fashioned-
bulldozing fullback who
can play center, a halfback
who was the Southern Con-
ference’s leading pass
catcher at end fast year, a
quarterback who has com-
pleted over 50% of his pass-
es and is tied for second on
the team in rushing, and
topped off by a halfback
who runs and punts and
does both very well.

When All-Conference center
Bill Price graduated, leaving a
gaping hole in‘the middle of the
line Coach Dole shocked fans
by plugging the gap with high-
ly-touted fullback Dave Warden.
Warden shored up the line with
his size and mobility but due
to inadequate defensing at the
linebacker posts and the
emergence of soph Hal Bynum
as a competent ‘lineman, Dole
elected to shift Warden back to
fullback and Bynum to the
regular center slot.

RUINED CITADEL

. The move payed off in the
Citadel upset as Warden gained
consistently with his explosive
bursts up the middie and scored
the winning TD. Bynum was a
standout at center, playing the
full sixty minutes of playing
time.

year, Dole decided to utilize

Wall’s heft and speed at

halfback, thus providing an

inside-ovtside threat with
shifty Paul Barbee.

Quarterback Charlie Benson,
as a sophomore had the unen-
viable distinction of following
two of Davidson's finest field
generals. Dick Belton and Dyke
Little. who graduated in 1958.
Benson performed admirably,
utilizing the ground and air.
with equal facility as he kept
among the conference total of-
fense leaders.

A powerful runner, he is also
an adapt defense man noted
for his pass interceptions. Ben-
son is tenth ranked in total of-
fense in the conference. His
fifty yards rushing ties him
with Wall for second in team
rushing statistics.

BARBEE TOUGH 5
Halfback Paul Barbee is cur-
rently ranked third in net rush-
ing yardage in conference
standings. He is fifth in punting
with a 36.9 yard average. Bar-
bee is also a threat with the
running pass. The Asheboro
speedster, a three year regular,

is seventh in total offense.
