Wildcats Ready to Give
Furman Hard Fight

Hornets Have Great Creat Team, But Pres-
byterians Will Be in the Scrap

Davidson will wind her football
season up Thanksgiving in Green-
ville, S. C., where her opponent will
be Furman. The Wildcats have a
hard nut to crack in these plucky
warriors and it is a toss up as to
who will come out on top.

Furman has played brilliant ball
this year and for its size is one of
the best teams in the South. There
are not over 150 men from which to
pick a gridiron squad, and yet this
school tackles all comers. As far as
Davidson is concerned the following
results ate food for thought: Fur-
man whipped Wake Forest 39 to 6.
Davidson licked the Baptists 21 to
0. This would indicate a slight_ad-
vantage for Furman. Again, Fur-
man won from P. C. by one touch-
down, while the latter held David-
son to a scoreless tie. It must be
taken into consideration, however,
that Johnson and Black were out cf
the Davidson-P. C. game. Also
Clemson, easily outplayed, was ior-
tunate in securing a 7 to 7 tie with
Furman. The Tigers whipped Da-
vidson tho 7 to 0. The dope would
indicate a slight advantage in favor
of Furman, but Red and Black
backers can console themselves
with the fact that the dope has been
turned inside out this year.

The line-up will probably be:

Impromptu Parade Held Last
Thursday Afternoon—Gave
Creditable Exhibition

Maj. C. H. Daniels, District In-
spector, passed thru Davidson last
Thursday. When he arrived, how-
ever, the regular drill for the day
was over, and he seemed willing to
wait until his next visit before see-
ing the battalion at work. But,
Colonel Mueller was not content to
let matters rest thus; he was an-
xious for Major Daniels to see_the
progress his unit had made. So a
battalion parade was held at 2:30
o'clock.

In spite of the fact that many of
the officers and non-commissioned
officers were absent for football
ptactice, the parade went thru
smoothly. The band was at its best
amd the whole ceremony was im-
pressive. After the parade the
companies were drawn up before
the armory for a few minutes, and
the inspector gave a short talk. He
said that he had enjoyed the parade
very much, and was very agreeably

Formal Opening of Speak-|Debating Cup Won by Cup Won by

Eumenean Society

Phi Suffers Defeat for First Time in
Five Years—Ormand and Dun-
lap Receive Medals

For the first time in five years
the Junior-Senior debating cup
passed over into the hands of the
Eumeneans as the result of their
triumph over the Philanthropic de-
baters last Thursday night. The
medals were awarded to A, P. Or-
mon, Eu,, and M. Dunlap, Phi.,
both of the Junior class. The larg-
est audience for several years past
was present at the debate, all of
whom found their time well spent.
The debaters had worked hard, and
consequently the speeches showed
thoro research and careful prepara-
tion.

The subject of the debate was,
“Resolved, That Immigration shall
be prohibited for five years.” The

Phi debaters, who upheld the afirm-

ative side, were C. G. Long, C. K.
Brown and J. M. Dunlap. The Ku
debaters were A. M. Mitchell, A. P.
Ormond and R. T. L. Liston. C. G.
Long, the first speaker for the
affirmative, stated the following as
the points which the affirmative
would endeavor to maintain: That
immigration is not economically
beneficial; that it is not socially up-
lifting, it is not politically wise, and
the prohibition of immigration for
five years is the proper step to take
in dealing with the problem. Long
reserved the first point for himself,
and divided his argument into two
parts: immigration has not been
beneficial in the past, and is not
beneficial at the present. The im-
migrants who have come are illit-
erate, ignorant and unskilled in la-
bor. They come here for selfish
purposes; they are no longer refu-
gees from a tyrannical rule. Immi-
grants come here to make money.
By sending money back to their
own families in the native countries
this country receives a distinct
financial loss. C. K. Brown, the
second speaker for the affirmative,
argued that such a law would not be
socially uplifting or politically wise.
He claimed that sentimental rea-

Offensive

and Defensive Game
Teams Battle to 0 to 0 Score—Cassell and Hammett Stars for Wildcats—

P. C. Shows Splendid

Team Work—Davidson’s

Goal in Danger Several Times

Holding like a stone wall, under
her own goal posts, in the last min-
ute of play Davidson robbed Pres-
byterian College of a chance for vic-
tory, and advanced the ball out of
danger before the final whistle
blew. The Wildcats were fortunate
indeed to emerge from the fracas
with the result a scoreless tic. The
Palmetto team threatened to score
on other occasions, and the only
thing that: saved Davidson was the
opportune breaks in the game.

Receiving the kick-off in the
opening half, P. C. ran the ball back
to mid-field, By a- series of line
bucks, they finally advanced the ball
to Davidson’s seven-yard line by a
clever lateral pass. At this junc-
ture, the Red and Black defense
stiffened, and held the aggressors
for. two downs and threw them for
a four-yard loss the third down.
Fulton, dropped back to the 20-yard
line and attempted a drop kick. It
proved a miserable failure, and Da-
vidson advanced the ball out of dan-
ger the remainder of the half.
Again in the opening of the final
quarter, P. C. rushed the ball to the
21-yard line. Here Fulton again
fizzled,a drop kick.

Not once during the whole game
did Davidson demonstrate a flash of
football, Only once did she make a
substantial gain, this being by the
aerial route for 23 yards to Doug-
The South Carolina lads made
11 first downs against three for Da-
vidson. Time after time they cut
down the Wildcat interference and
pinned the runner without a gain.

The only redeeming feature for
Davidson was the playing of Ham-
mett and Cassell. The former prov-
ed the backbone on the defense and
frequently broke through the P. C.
line, throwing their backs for losses.
Cassell’s toe undoubtedly was the
chicf factor in saving Davidson

from defeat. The clever Virginian’s.

punts were accurate and well plac-
ed. On one occasion while on his
own 39 yard line, he dodgeil one P.
C. tackler and kicked through three
others. of the defense who had
broken through. Special mention
should be made of the. entire I. C.
backfield. Their interference was
excellent. Fulton ran the team in
ship-shape style and on one occa-
sion intercepted a forward pass and
returened 34 yards before being
forced outside. Belk and Richer-
son skirted the ends for consistent
gains, and McMillan, at full, plowed
thru the line at will until Davidson’s
goal was in imminent danger.

The day was ideal for football.
Much enthusiam was aroused
among the rooters and even tho the
Wildcats were putting up a bad
game, the student body was behind
the team to the finish. The crowd
was estimated to be about 800, with
a large percentage of Charlotte folk
present who had motored up.

First Quarter.

P. C. won the toss, and chose to
receive at the south goal. Davidson
lined up without Black and John-
son, much to the dismay of the stu-
dents. Cassel kicked to Belk, who
received on the 25-yard line and ran
the kick-off back to midfield. Rich-
erson made five thru guard and four
more in the same place.
made two thru center
