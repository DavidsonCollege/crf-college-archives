Preparation For A
Life of Happiness

The Qualities the M. C. Should Try
to Cultivate.

The Ministerial Band held its weekly
meeting last Friday at 6:45 p.m. A
business meeting was held before the
regular service, in which it was decided
to have a Ministerial Band Feed.” A
committee was appointed te make ar-
rangements for it.

After an opening Song, the president
of the bad, W, ML. Currie, made a talk
on “Things a Ministerial Candidate
Should ‘Wry to Cultivate.” Bill said
that, strictly speaking, a man does not
study to be a minister while in college,
but is getting a general preparation for
life. AH the same, he should endeavor
to cultivate certain qualities which are
necessary for a successful minister. First
of all, he should cailtivate his mind. He
should be able to grasp the thoughts of
athers and: adapt them to his own use.
He should also learn to concentrate—to
apply himself to lys sermon, or whatever
he has in hand, and put his whole force
behind its accomplishment. “The second
quality a ministerial candidate
cultivate is to know human nature, Col-
lege is the best time in his life to observe
the development of character, to see un-
disguised human nature—note its weak-
nesses, its peculiarities, its strong points,
A man can learn how to approach pe-
cvliay types of character which are gen-

_ erally considered sunapproachable.

Finally. the most important thing of
all is to cultivate friendship. ‘The fore-
going qualities ‘are important, but their
usefulness is greatly lessened unless he
can “wear well’—unless he can get on
with other peaple ine everyday — life.
‘hen, too, a minister needs to have
friends. Fle needs to have friends that
will stick to him, and will net hesitate to
use their influence to help him. ‘The
minister who is a grouch has missed his
calling.

Every member of the band is urged to
he present at the next meeting, 6245. p.
mm. Friday, February. 7.
