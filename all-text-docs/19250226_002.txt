The North Carolina State “Technique

‘that the first Davidson-Duke game was noth-
ing but an exhibition affair.

However, the correct standing of the clubs
is shown above with the Wildcats hanging
on to second place. :

While on the topie of basketball a word
about Coach Rawson's Freshman quint is in
order, Although losing all four games of its
trip through the state the yearlings showed
up well everywhere,

When a team plays on foreign soil and
loses four games by margins of eight, seven
(two) and three points, it looks as if they
played good basketball.

We'd like to turn the Wildkittens loose on
any of those quints on our own floor,

Something should be done right now so
that next year our Fresh quint and baseball
nine can play a real schedule. If the policy
of allowing them only enough games to get
started is continued, high school athletes will
turn to other schools.

Coach Rawson was speaking highly of the
work of his two guards—Brown and Harri-
son. Not a single substitution was made for
either on the entire trip, both featuring in all
of the games. Milner also showed up nicely
at times at forward.

The defeat which the grapplers gave Caro-

{lina Saturday night was a grand climax toa

From last Saturday's showing, one of the

Arrowood put up easily the featuring
play of the game. However, Coach Tilson
did not use his varsity men enough for them
to really get started, and with Bohannon,
Pinkney and Baker all there also it will be a
lively scrap.

Mutt Nesibt was perhaps the best looking
in the backfield of either team.

+ have its curtain pulled down in the final Da-

vidson-Wake Forest clash at Davidson. In
between the two games comes a scrap with
the Guilford team on the home floor Friday |
evening.

The Wake Forest quint defeated Davide|
son 48-36 in the first meeting this year, stag: |
ing a neat rally on their own court, after
Davidson had led by one point at the end of
the first half. The Baptists have a strong
quint—in fact one of the strongest in years,
and have been going well.

More than the usual fight that character-
izes a Davidson-Wake Forest game will be
developed in that the two games decide who
will rank as runner-up to the North Caro-
lina team in the state race. The Tar Heels
have won the championship, but second hon-
ors will go to either the Baptists or Presby
terians. The line-up for tonight follows

The delegates on Sunday morning attend-
ed the services of the various denominations
in the town and were cordially received by
everyone, In the afternoon the election of |
new officers was held. The old officers were |
succeeded by the following new ones: Pres-
ident, Miss Elizabeth Cowen, of N.C. C. W.;
vice-president, Miss Minnie Herrin, of Mere-
dith; secretary, Miss Cordia Thompson, of
Guilford; treasurer, Miss Maude Hunter, of
Duke University.

The first thing of the convention each
morning was the carly morning watch or
prayers. Such a manner and method of |
procudure apparently caused the convention |
to be an even greater success than it would ;
have been otherwise, as the members took |
part unreservedly in the watches.

Among the many speakers of the confer-
ence were the following: T. M. North, of |
Rocky Mount, N. C., who spoke on Mis- |
sions; Mr. Shaffer, a missionary from |
Japan; Mr. S. C. Farrior, who is an educa: |
tional missionary in China at the present; |
and the latter’s wife, Mrs. S. C. Farrior. |
These are only a part of the speakers at the |
conference, and it is regretted that the others |
are not known by name. All the lecturers |
and speakers proved to be helpful and in- |
structive in their talks on various phases of |
mission work.

The spirit and fight shown by. the entire

to all who have observed. The excellent
material from the Fresh eleven will aid a
great deal in the building of a good team
next fall. Ii the prospects continue to show
up as well in the future as they have during
the past few weeks there is no doubt that the
Wildcats will have a good team next fall.
