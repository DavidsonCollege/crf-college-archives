Judicial Committee will hear drug cases

Krista TIMEUS
Staff Writer

Davidson recently changed
its drug policy to allow charged
students to challenge their punish-
ment in a hearing before the Honor
Council. Before the reform, a stu-
dent accused of illegal drug use had
to accept his penalty as outlined in
Davidson’s Red Book.

“It was what it was,” Emest
Jeffries, Assistant Dean of Student
Life, said. “There was no hearing,
no appeal.” Now, a guilty student
can choose to either accept the
standard sanction, or request a
hearing before the Judicial Com-
mittee, whose members can then
decide on a more, less or equally
severe sanction.

“In my opinion, the previous
drug policy was purely punitive,
with no mind whatsoever for the
student involved,” Honor Coun-
cil Defense Advisor Anna Marie
Smith ’09 said.

Under the previous policy,
sanctioned individuals had to either
undergo immediate disciplinary
probation or leave the campus for
a period of time, depending on the
degree of their violation.

The new policy allows students
accused of drug violations the same
type of hearing that the school af-
fords other violators of the Honor
Code and Code of Responsibility.
At these hearings, they can learn
the details of their charges and have
“their mitigating circumstances be
heard,” Jeffries said. “The previous
[drug] policy didn’t really line up
with how we handled other viola-
tions of the Honor and Responsibil-
ity Codes. Now we have aligned it
with our philosophy.”

It is also the college’s hope that
charged students learn from their

mistakes. The goal is not simply
to punish, but to make the charged
student take responsibility for his
actions, and through dialogue, be-
come a better individual. Smith said
that the previous form of the policy
“lacked the things that I think Da-
vidson represents: helping students
learn from their mistakes so that
they can become better people.”

To be clear though, illegal use
of drugs on campus is strictly pro-
hibited. The penalties the college
imposes may still range from pro-
bation to indefinite suspension. For
example, first-time users of what
are referred to as a “Schedule VI
drugs” (e.g. Marijuana, THC, Hash-
ish, Hash Oil) can, at the very least,
face a year-long disciplinary proba-
tion period, required participation
in a drug abuse treatment program
and have a letter sent home. On
the other end of the spectrum, the
sale, distribution or manufacture
of unauthorized drugs leads to an
immediate suspension. For details,
consult Red Book.

Students gather for the dedicatio

What is different is that now
accused individuals “may choose
to appear before the Judicial Com-
mittee to determine an appropriate
sanction. And a student charged but
not admitting guilt will appear be-
fore the Honor Council,” according
to the text of the new policy.

The benefit for students is that
the Judicial Committee will hear
“the extenuating circumstances
that might exist in each individual
case,” outgoing Honor Council
Chair Cary Wright ’09 said. “Basi-
cally, the change allows a little more
flexibility regarding the process by
which drug offenses are dealt with
so that every case is treated on an
individual basis.”

“Though the change may seem
small, it can allow for an accused
student to have a hearing and be
treated as an individual,” Smith
said. Davidson students may feel
confident that their cases will be
heard fairly and considered accord-
ing to the principles of Davidson’s
Honor Code and overall mission.

Community forums seek student involvement

Kesey LILLEY
News Editor

In an effort to further involve
the community, the Town of Da-
vidson is hosting several upcoming
community forums, all of which
Davidson students are highly en-
couraged to attend.

The community forums are
a part of the broader Davidson
Comprehensive Plan, which seeks
to “discuss ways to achieve a sus-
tainable environment, efficient
transportation, economically vi-
able development, enduring citizen
participation, diverse community,
vibrant public spaces and. fiscal
health” for Davidson, according to
the town’s planning website, www.
ci.davidson.nc.us.

Town Planner. Lauren Black-
burn is the project manager for the
Comprehensive Plan. She noted
that the purpose of the community
forums is to involve the public as

much as possible in decisions re-
garding Davidson’s future.

“We're very pleased with the
level of interested participants, but
we’re always looking to expand the
public’s role in the plan with coop-
erative initiatives,” Blackburn said.
Her ideal goal would be to have
participation from all 9,100 David-
son residents. This figure includes
Davidson College students.

“T believe wholeheartedly that
Davidson College students have a
great deal to contribute,” Blackbum
said, specifically commenting that
Davidson students may have exper-
tise or are majoring in subjects that
are applicable to subjects that the
forums address, such as economic
development or sustainability.

“We know that Davidson Col-
lege students are very educated—
we would love to hear what you
have to say,” she said. “We don’t
discriminate by age.” Currently,
one Davidson student participates

in one of the study groups.

Besides mentioning the town’s
desire to hear Davidson College
student input regarding the town’s
development, Blackburn also said
that many graduates wind up re-
turning to the town to visit or even
live, making it more important for
students to participate.

“Alumni are interested in how
the town is developing,” Blackburn
said. And the community forums
are a chance to “put some thoughts
on paper for how you want the town
to look in 10 to 20 years.”

Along with these community
forums, the Town has also set up
“study groups,” whose jobs are
to focus on a more specific set of
issues, including — sustainability,
economic development and mobil-
ity. Elementary and middle school
students have also been included
in a “student vision committee” to

Town hires
* lobbyist *

Davidson is taking its case
for money to the capital of
the United States. The town
of Davidson, in conjunction
with the town of Cornelius, has
hired Steve Dye, Director of
Federal Affairs at McAllister &
Quinn, LLC, to lobby the federal
government for money. Dye
will “work to secure funding
at the federal level for, local
projects,”.. Sara-Lynne Levine,
Communications Director for the
Town of Davidson, said.

The board discussed three
priorities for Dye to pursue in
Washington during their Jan. 13
meeting, Levine said. According
to DavidsonNews.net,. an in-
formational website run by
and for Davidson residents, the
board mandated that Dye pursue
funding for a community center,
a pedestrian crossing over I-77
and a parking deck in town.

The town’s portion of funding
for the community center, to
be located at the Davidson IB
Middle School, is four million
dollars, and Dye will pursue
federal aid for that portion. The
town also wants funding for a
pedestrian crossing linking the
homes on Lake Norman across
I-77 to the rest of the town. The
final priority is a parking deck
to be located near the town hall.
“The three million dollar deck
would. serve commuter bus
riders and downtown shoppers
and employees and eventually
could provide parking for the
planned Commuter Rail station,”
according to the Jan. 27 article
on DavidsonNews.net.

There are also other projects
that the town would like to
pursue. Levine said that the town
would like to install roundabouts
at the intersections of Beaty and
Griffith Streets and Concord
Road and Pine Street, but these
projects will not take place for
a.while because of a lack of
requisite money. “They’re going
to be on hold for now,” she said.
The three projects listed above
are the main projects Dye plans
to pursue.

Davidson and Comelius have
jointly hired Dye for a total of
$72,000, DavidsonNews.net re-
ported. Davidson will split the
cost with Cornelius, bringing
the town’s total cost for Dye to
$36,000. The proposed contract,
available on DavidsonNews.net,
stipulates monthly payments of
$3,000 over the course of one
