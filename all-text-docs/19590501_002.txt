THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIOSON COLLEGE

FRIDAY, MAY 1, 1959

But Why SO Legitimate?

It is with much disappointment
and question that we greet the an-
nouncement (page one) that the fra-
ternity housing fee has, for the sec-
ond time in as many semesters, gone
up. ‘

Our question is not on the fact
that the college should be paid back
its investment, or even that it should
make some profit on the investment.

The fact is that the college has
made an investment which has en-
hanced its appearance, has raised its
physical standards, and has done its
fraternity system a big favor, and at
the same time is receiving from the
occupants of the houses an interest
rate which is one-half to one per cent
higher than the present rate on Unit-
ed ‘States Government bonds, which
are at their highest point since 1929.

Again, we don't question the right
of the college to be paid for the use
of its money. We only ask, “What is
the relation between the college and
its student body?” Does the college
have an obligation to the students,
or can it treat them collectively as an
unknown borrower walking into a
bank?

The college, it seems to us, is hav-

ing its cake and eating it too, in that
it has added to itself and is still get-
ting paid for it.

We hate to launch into arithmetic,
however mild it may be, but it ‘is on-
ly for the purpose of proving our
point. Estimating eight hundred stu-
dents paying forty-six dollars a year,
we find that the total payment every
year is some thirty-seven thousand
dollars. At this rate of payment, the
$420,000 debt, along with the five
per cent interest each year on the
amount still unpaid, will be complete-
ly returned in seventeen years. The
total interest alone will have amount-
ed to over two hundred thousand do!-
lars.

If the student body had borrowed
$420.000 to build its. own court, it
would have been theirs at the end
of this time. But instead, the students
will presumably keep paying the
thirty-seven thousand dollars annual-
ly, which will be pure profit for the
college, paid by the students.

We see the college's point. It ig
entitled to a legitimate return on its
investment. But does the return have
to be so legitimate?

True Spirit
Of Giving

YMCA Treasurer Bob Denham as-
sures us that it’s fact and not. just
our imagination that the Vespers’ Of-
fering on the Sunday following a
dance weekend is quite generous con-
sidering the sparse number in atten-
dance. We noted with amazement
Sunday that the collection plates were
tight side up. and we spied quite a
few dollar bills.

Guess the preachers are right
about our material emphasis—some
people think they can buy off anyone.

Reslize Those
“Fringe Benefits”

This week the DAVIDSONIAN ini-
tiates what will be a permanent policy
of carrving the names of faculty mem-
bers who will hold open house Sun-
day night after Vespers. (See page
four).

One of the arguments for a small
college which has appeared several
times in these columns in our opposi-
tion to increased enrollment, is that
a small school affords the opportunity
for a close relationship between facul-
ty and students. This is perhaps one
of. the most tangibie of the “intangi-
bles” that a small liberal arts insti-
tution has to offer.

“The Sunday night open house is
an excellent chance to realize one
of Davidson's “fringe benefits.” It is
one of the college's traditions that is
well worth continuing.

Such informal gatherings are op-
portunities to explore areas un-
touched in class, to discuss local, or
world affairs. or just to get to know
the man. who delivers from the plat-
form three or four times a week.

{

Student-faculty relations were
somewhat strained during the last
schoo! year, but with the coming of
the Martin Administration, and by
tne efforts of both groups, they are
again reaching their proper equilib-
rium.

The fraternities have strength-
ened the cause by inviting various
members of the faculty and admini-
stration and their wives to their re-

spective houses for a meal each week.
From all reports this has been a
worthwhile project.

Participation in the Sunday night
program is just another way in which
the trend toward better student-facul-
ty relations can be continued.

The DAVIDSONIAN hopes the
members of the student body will
take advantage of this unique oppor-
tunity and thereby enjoy one of the
privileges that a small school pro-
vides.

One of the most antiquated and |
unreasonable rules imposed on us is
the one which prohibits the opening

of the gymnasium on Sunday after- |

It is a sign of the unwillingness of
the present fathers of this institution
to move from the position of the
founding fathers. Years ago, when it
was illegal to play tennis or throw
a ball around the campus, the prohibi-
tion of gym activities was to be ex-
pected. Today it is not.

The library is open on Sunday aft-
noon, yet the gym is not. We recog-
nize. and are quite proud of David-
son’s outstanding academic reputa-
tion; we are not proud of the fact
that over half our freshmen class can-
not pass the required Physical Edu-

Communication Barriers Must Be Surmounted By YHICA

The man I like is like me.
My enemy differs from me. You
can tell a man by the company
he keeps; you could even say
that a man is like the people
he travels with, that he is what

. he is because of them. There-

fore, I shall travel with the de-
cent. with those like me; I can-
not communicate my decency,
my virtue, to others, for then
I run the risk of losing it. I
cannot be seen with those un-
like myself.
¢ e ° e e

Several months ago Doug Bal-

lentine suggested that students
begin to seek a solution for the
problems of communication and
isolation. The response to his
suggestion was feeble.

The fact that his finger point-
ed at the hollow heart of our
life as a community may have
contributed to our unwilling-
ness to support him; he may
have been too close to the
truth.

this problem in the coming
year. Indeed, the establishing of
rea! communication among
those of the total community
might well be the goal of fra-
ternities, denominational  fel-
lowships, the student council,
and the administration.
MANY BARRIERS

The communication would be
across many barriers, The eco-
nomic barriers which separate
the’ whole student body from
those different from itself

The YMCA—as an open fellow- might be crossed in community
ship—should apply its  re- service, in pledge projects be-
sources toward the solution of yond the campus, in personal

visits to Barium Springs, in
Negro Work.

Social barriers within the
campus community might be
bridged through devices such
as fraternity retreats, and in-
formal gatherings on Sunday
afternoon at Erwin Lodge.

Intellectual barriers might
be crossed through author pro-
grams, drama, through periods
of special services on compara-
tive religions and vocations,
through expressed international
concern. As paths between peo-
ple and faiths became better
traveled, we might begin to

* tackle the overpowering prob-

lem of spiritual barriers.

OBSTACLES CROSSED

To cross a barricr is not to
conquer it, but it: is the neces-
sary first step. And_ besides,
barriers do not need to be re-
moved so much as to be
crossed.

Each of us has his supposed
monopoly on virtue. Perhaps we
can pool our various monopo-
lies and come to an understand-
ing of the nature of sin. Per-
haps communication and regen-
eration will begin here.

cation test. This fact lends itself too |

freely to a charge often leveled
against the Davidson Gentleman.

We can see no logical argument
against opening the gym on Sunday.
To develop one’s body is no more to
break the Sabbath than to develop
one’s mind. Not only does the col-
lege employ people to check books
in and out on Sunday, it also pays
students to check attendance at our
compulsory Sunday night religious
function. To hire the few needed to
open the gym is no more objection-
able than these other necessary jobs.

The DAVIDSONIAN asks that the
gym be opened on Sunday afternoon.
It’s time to throw out this inconsistent
tule and welcome in the new. It’s
time to look and move forward.

Deep Appreciation, High Praise
Voiced In This Week’s Letters

Dan Clemmer

Dear Editor: ;

The overwhelming response
by fhe student body to the re-
quest for blood for Barbara
Blews was appreciated both by
our fraternity and by the
Blews family.

She received over 100 pints
of blood-in the blood drive
Monday, but all- of this is not
now needed. The number of
pints charged ‘against her at
present wil! be crased and she
will have a surplus for her
further use. As was stated last
week, the amount she does not
use will remain in the Charlotte
blood bank for use in this area.

Many students have shown
their concern for this drive by
asking about the response to
our request. This is indicative
of the fact that. students are
more interested in donating to
some specific person than to
an anonymous recipient. If
there were more specific re-
quests for blood, the turn-out
at the bloodmobile would prob-
ably be greater.

The Blews family wishes to
thank all of those who partici-

- pated in the blood drive’ for

Barbara, and is sorry that they
will be unable to thank all the
students individually. Members
of their church and friends of
the family have been donating

blood to her for some time;
but. because of the length of
her illness, the amount charged
against her has again increased.

Dear Editor:

Now and then a letter comes
to our office which we believe
of interest to all students. Such
a Jetter, from a Qreensboro
newsman who visited Davidson
for the inauguration recently,
arrived this week. I am quoting
it below for use in your col-
umns:

“Wanted to write you to
thank you for your help but
most of all to tell you some-
thing I took back with me.

“As I may have told you, ed-
ucation is my beat and I’ve
been to schools and colleges
all over the state for any num-
ber of reasoris. I found David-
son to be one of the cleanest,
loveliest campuses I have ever
seen . . . only Bennet comes
close and Dr. Benjamin Fine
once said in the New York
Times that Bennet was the most
beautiful small campus in the
country.

“But what impressed me
most was an intangible thing

that quite escapes me when it
comes to saying it in black and
white.

“It just appeared to me that
there was a difference in Da-
vidson students; a certain some-
thing that sets them apart from
the young men I see at Caro-
lina, Guilford or Catawba.

“They looked neat —- some-
thing quite rare these days; they
were more than courteous —
a quality fast disappearing.

“There seemed to be in all
of them a certain pride that
they were Davidson students. I
almost . had the feeling that
some of them might have been
gloating (and I wouldn’t blame
them) and ready to say: ‘I go
to Davidson . . . where did you
say you went?’

“But most of all it was their
demeanor, their attitude. I
can’t put my finger on it but
maybe you understand. . .

“My best wishes to you and
Davidson.

Sincerely,
Lane Kerr”

Mr. Kerr also expressed ap-
preciation to “Sam,” a helpful
student whose name he could
not remember, asking me to
convey his thanks to the stu-
dent for his kindness,

With Passover Gone,

S. & G Breathe Easier

We couldn’t help breathing a little sigh of relief
when Passover ended. The annual feast, which began on
the eve of 15 Nisan, ’59 and lasted until yesterday, is con-
sistently a jittery time for some of us first-born, especial-
ly with the SPCA breathing down your neck every time.

Stop now, Selma. You know we didn’t make dead-
line last week because of that...

We think critics should stop harping on this bit about
students whistling at the speakers in Chapel. They don’t
realize how much personal anguish they are causing a few
people out there. In Chapel, Selma sits next to a fat slob
with very narrow nostrils who, although he’s jovial,
emits a shrill, piercing whistle every time he exhales.

The surest way to hurt someone's feelings is to make
light of his physical deformities; this is in a class with trip-
ping gimps or sending apples to the dysentery ward. So
let’s ease up on the criticism and try to spare their digni-
ty. They are perfect gentlemen except when they breathe. "

Our sincere sympathies are extended to the alumni
relations department and attached personnel, who, dur-
ing the course of the inaugural festivities, became so

enthusiastic that they exceeded the 360-degree grin
limit and decapitated themselves.

Even more appalling was the case of one of the lead-
ing officials who made such a herculean effort that he
was drawn and quartered; this was fortunate, however,
in that it put him out of his misery over a hernia in-
curred earlier in the day. Smiling can be hell. I guess it’s
the price one has to pay for leadership in the field.

I finally persuaded Selma to junk her new spring
outfit, which she bought especially for the dance week-
end. It was gray; that seemed to be her favorite color
last week. She claimed it made her feel more at ease
when she was with the boys.

The dress was from Alcoa, the crinolines were from
American Wire, and the lingerie was from U. S. Army
Ordnance (high explosive anti-tank). She weighed 500
pounds when she got it all on, but she was insistent about
the whole thing. What was even worse, all the girls in
her dorm were snatching up their own armor.

Looks like I don’t need that can opener any more,
Selma.

Pope John's Reign
Starts With Changer

By JOHN STONE

°

Events have lately focused
much attention on the Papacy.
A great Pope has died; his suc-
cessor shows signs of greatness.
The two, however, are not
necessarily alike. Pope Pius XII
was a nobleman; John XXIII is
of peasant stock. Public ap-
pearences of the Pope have
been relatively infrequent in
the past, but John XXIII likes
to circulate among the people.
Both Popes have been Italians.

While John XX has
reigned for only a short time,

a@ number of important events

have teken place. One of

these has been the calling
of an ecumenical Council at

the Lateran Palace for 1960.

The last such Council was in

1870, at which the doctrine of

Papal infallibility was fully

enunciated.

The Council of 1960 may have
several things on its agenda.
There has been much specula-
tion that John XXIII wants to

MY PAD WITH
ANYONE!

reunite certain portions of
Christendom, particularly the
Eastern or Greck Orthodox
Church, with the Roman Catho-
lie Church. Protestant Church-
es, in addition, have been in- ~
vited.

The viewpoint of the Or-
thodox Church, however,
seems to be that there ceu
be no union until at feast
the dogma of Papal infaili-
bility is repeated. Often un-
expected Jhings have come
from Church Councils, and
this one may be interesting.

Another action of the Pope,
one which may culminate in
the Council in 1960, is the at-
tempt to define more carefully
the Catholic attitude toward
Communism. At first, observers
felt that John XXJII might case
the strained relations between
the Church and Communism. In
view of some more recent ac-
tions, however, this has been
questioned. ”

While the Catholics east of
the Iron Curtain may be some-
what more free in their deal-
ings with the various Com-
munist governments, in the
West a precedent has been set
by the Papal denunciation of
a popular front between the
Communists and the Social
Democrats in Sicily. But the
full answer to all these prob-
lems has not yel been spelled
out.
