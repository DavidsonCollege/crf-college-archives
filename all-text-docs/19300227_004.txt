Wildkittens End State
Trip With One Win and
Two Losses in Biz Five

Duke and Carolina Show Superior-
ity in Finding Basket

STATE FROSH BEATEN

Davidson Ranks Third in Final
Rating of Big Five First Year
Quintets

The Davidson Wildkittens lost two out
of the three games on their trip through
the state of North Carolina. In the first
game they defeated the Little Wolfpack
of State, 32 to 25, However, in the next
contest the Duke Blue Imps conquered
the Little Cats by the score of 31 to 14, In
the final game of the road trip the Caro-
lina Little Tarheels overcame the Wild-
kittens 24 to 19..The Kittens have now
lost six games: Roanoke, V. P. I., Oak
Ridge, Belmont Abbey, Duke, and Caro-
lina, and stand in third place in the State:
Duke, first, Carolina, second, Davidson,

third, State, fourth, and Wake Forest,
fifth,

The State game, which the Wildkittens
won 32 to 25, was
throughout; it was tied five times, the
score at the end of the half being: David-
son 16, State 12. The feature of the game
was the fast playing of both teams both
offensively and defensively. The stars for
Davidson were Rogers, who had twelve
points, and Pierce, who had ten points.
Both of these men were brilliant on the
defensive and powerful in the offensive.
The high scorers for the Wolfpack were
Clark and Morris, with nine and eight
points respectively.

The next game, with ‘Duke, which the
freshmen lost 31 to 14, was featured by
the brilliant play of the whole Duke team.
This marked the tenth straight victory
for the Little Blue Devils. They have de-
feated Wake Forest, State, and Carolina
freshmen twice each and this game finish-
ed their list, and gave them the state
championship. During the first half of this
game the Wildkittens were able to get
only four points, two of them on foul
shots. The score at the end of the half
was Duke 20, Davidson 4. The high point
man of the game was Capelli of Duke,
who had seven points to his credit. He
was closely followed by Hill of Duke and
Peabody of Davidson, who had five
points each,

The last game of the trip was played
at Chapel Hill, where the Carolina Fresh-
men defeated the Little Cats by the score
of 24-19, This was probably the most in-
teresting game of the trip for the teams
stayed neck and neck throughout the
game. The score at the end of the first
half was Carolina 11, Davidson 10. At the
beginning of the second half Davidson
shot a foul shot knotting the score, but
then Carolina took the lead never to be
headed again. The Wildkittens staged a
rally and were only one point behind,
20-19. Then the Little Tarheels came back
and scored four points before the pistol
was fired. The high scorer for Carolina
was Wilmer Hines, tennis champion, who
scored ten points; he was followed by
Beale, who had six points to his credit.
The high scorers for the Wildkittens were

Pierce with twelve points and Rogers with
six points.

INTERESTING TALKS

(Continued from Page 1)
for several of the best works of her time.
As example of this, he cited, Spencer’s
“Fairy Queen,” and several of Shakespeare’s
sonnets. The age of “Good Queen Bess,,
was according to, the speaker, the first great
period in English Literature.

On Friday afternoon Mr. Ellsworth gave

The greater part of this talk was taken up
with discussions of the lives and personality
of the greater writers of the past generation,
with many of whom, such as Mark Twain,
Lowell, and Stevenson, the speaker was per-
sonally acquainted.

As the subject of his concluding discourse,4
delivered Friday night, Mr. Ellsworth chose
“Wordsworth, Coleridge, and the Lake
Poets.” He dwelt particularly upon the in-
fluence of the friendship of the two leaders
of this second great period of literature in
England upon the writings of the two, men-
tioning also the close relations of Words-
worth’s sister Dorothy, to the pair.

All the lectures were delivered in the

of Iowa, Washington State College, Univer-
sity of Oregon, Rosé Polytechnic Institute,
Norwich University, University of Wash-
ington, South Dakota State College, North
Dakota Agriculture College, University of
Nebraska and North Georgia Agriculture
College.

On Thursday February 27 the team will
go to Gastonia to fire a shoulder-to-shoulder
match with the Gastonia Rifle Club. Every
year a match is fired with this club and it
is one of the best matches of the season.

Later in the season the team will go to Vir-

ginia for matches with Va. Military Insti-
tue and*Va. Polytechnic Institute. -

Davidson Students
Try To Aid At Fire

Shortly after. 11 p. m. Monday, Feb-
ruary 17 the various activities of the
students were rudely interrupted by the
shrieking of the siren announcing the dis-
covery of fire. At a seemingly short dis-
tance in the direction of Corneliigrthe
sky was overcast by a faint red glow. A
mad rush for the fire house followed with
the would-be heroes dragging out all
kinds of equipment such as ladders, hose
and chemicals, and dashing off for the
scene of the fire. This, however, proved
to be more of a task than was first sup-
posed, for the farther one went the far-
ther away it seemed to-be.-It proved to be
a one story dwelling on the other side of
Cornelius, a distance of at least a mile
and a half from Davidson. Upon the ar-
rival of the students the house had burned
almost to the ground. The destruction was
complete as very-little was salvaged from
the burning building.

Though no assistance could be rendered
by the College fire department because
of the great distance intervening, its
morale was shown to be excellent by the
hearty response of its members.

STUDENTS HEAR SOUTHERN

A number of Davidson students took
advantage of the special rates offered to
hear E. H. Sothern, noted interpreter
of Shakespeare, in his dramatic recital at
Central High Auditorium in Charlotte last
Thursday evening. Mr. Sothern played
to a large and appreciative audience. The
conflict of his program with examination
period here at Davidson hurt the attend-
ance of students somewhat.

Williams, time advantage five minutes and
46 seconds.
Referee: May (Duke).

Glee Club Returns
From Recent Trip

The College Glee Club and Orchestra on
Saturday, February 15, completed a four-
day trip in which they visited Roanoke,
Va.; Staunton, Va.; Greensboro, and
Statesville. The club was well received in
every city where it performed. Audiences
in Roanoke were especially appreciative.
This was the club’s first visit to Roanoke.

In Roanoke, the Davidsonians gave two
presentations: one of the Senior quar-
tette before the Kiwanis Club in the Pat-
rick Henry Hotel, and the other of the
entire company in the Jefferson High
School that same night, February 12. Of
the quartette, “The Ramblers,” the Roaz,
noke Times has to say: “4

“The Ramblers, composed of A. J.
Thompson, first tenor, C. C. Orr, second
tenor, R. W. McDermid, first bass, and
R. W. Christian, second bass, sang three
selections whith were roundly applauded
by the Kiwanians.”

The concert presented at the high
school was very enthusiastically received :

“An enthusiastic audience, composed of
a large number of local music lovers,
greeted the Davidson College Glee Club
at its first Roanoke concert.’”—Roanoke
Times.

Seven members of.the club met with
loud applause at a pre-concert program
that morning before the students of Jef-
ferson High:

“The program today, made up of quar-
tet and solo vocal numbers and violin
duets, was received with such evident ap-
preciation that it is safe to predict that
many of the students.will return to the
auditorium bringing their friends to enjoy
the more elaborate concert this evening
when many new song hits as well as old
favorites will be sung in true collegiate
style.”

This was the first time the Glee Club
and Orchestra has visited Roanoke and
due to the fact that they made such a
good impression, they will doubtless be
welcome again in the Virginia city.

J. Lee Sloan
Reappointed As
Davidson Postmaster

Davidson Ex-Mayor Has Just
Finished Highly Successful
Term of Office

J. Lee Sloan, who has been postmaster
at Davidson for the past four years, has
recently been notified by the postmaster
general at Washington of his re-appoint-
ment for another four-year term. He had
previously been notified by Senator Sim-
mons, and confirmation followed a few
days later.

When Mr. Sloan was urged to stand an
examination four years ago, he was
mayor of Davidson, but when he suc-
cessfully passed the test and received the
appointment, he resigned as mayor to
accept the post. During the time he has
been handling the affairs here, he has as-
sembled an excellent corps of assistants,
who dispatch mail promptly, and dis-
tribute it quickly. Few complaints have
been filed to Washington because of the
service here, which is generally char-
acterized as excellent.

The Davidson postmaster has lived here
practically all of his life, and is familiar
with the constitutency he serves. He had
been mayor, at periodical intervals for a
total of 21 years, before he resigned to
become postmaster.
