BO RODDEY

Roddey Ranks High Among College Stars

By BILL WHITE

Southern Conference champion-
ships, virtually as scarce and vague
an item as Sunday movies in this
Presbyterian village, now are loom-
ing, mind you, just around the cor-
ner and Oliver (Bo) Roddey is the
man marked to pick them up and
bring them home.

The boyish Charlotte senior at
present rates as the class of the
conference courts in the singles
field, and teamed with Davidson's
No. 2 man Whit Cobb, he’s the
logical leading contender for the
loop doubles crown when the Sou-
thern Conference matches are run
off on Davidson's all-weather
greens the middle of May.

All this is not early season spec-
ulation. Oliver Bo is certainly no
flash in the pan who has looked
good in recent competition and is
being boomed for conference hon.
ors. This prize would come only
as the climax of a long, up-hill-all-
the.way scrap in prep and collegiate
circles. A senior now, Roddey is

tabbed the man to beat to take a
title previously in the hands of
William and Mary’s Fred Kovales-
ki and North Carolina’s Vic Seixas
before him. In his sophomore and
junior years, Bo advanced in con-
ference play until he was stopped
by one of these brilliant racke-
teers.

Undefeated his sophomore year,
Roddey went on that summer, cam.
paining on the courts in tourna-
ments all over the East, to turn in
some of the finest tennis of his
career, bowing in Cleveland to
Pancho Gonzales after carrying the
former U. S. Amateur champ to
three sets, one to a gruelling 10-8

‘| count.

Last spring, Bo was _ tripped
thrice, meeting some of the strong-
est collegiate netters in the country.
In addition to several minor tourna.
ments added along the way, Rod-
dey had it mostly all his way in
winning the North Carollna state
singles crown at Greensboro late
last August and sharing the dou-

bles with Cobb.

This spring, Bo, exclusive of
yesterday's match with Florida, has
chalked up six wins in seven starts,
losing on the southern tour to Rol-
lins’ Chilean No. 1 man Balbiers.
As yet, the Cats have not met a
Southern Conference foe. When
they do, Roddey will go into the
better part of them the favorite.

It isn’t easy to have the No. §
ranking in the South hung onto you
and a favorite role in most of your
matches, to boot. That’s what Bo
has ahead of him, however, There
is plenty of tough competition
ahead; to wit, Carolina’s Clark
Taylor, a blaster who has been
scalping every foe in sight lately.

As Smith Barrier, sports editor
of the Greensboro Daily News, re-
marked after Bo won the singles
this past summer, he still looks like
the freckle-faced kid who walked
away with the boys’ crown not so
many years back. Still, modest, un-
assuming Bo with a knack for win-
ning championships.

tory in a row.:

The victory streak was decided.
ly stopped when the Davidson net-
ters traveled to Winter Park to
oppose Rollins. Rob Palmer was
the only singles swan to knock
down a Davidson victory, whilé
Roddy and Cobb continued their
winning streak in doubles; hoi-

-ever, both Wildcat wins went three

sets. Rollins really rolled, and de-
feated the ‘Cats, 7-2.

Gainesville, Florida, saw a
bloody good match between Bar-
ton’s boys and Florida University’s
netters. When the noise subsided
and the dust cleared, the Floridians
had squeezed out a 5§-4 victory
over the visiting Carolinians.

Georgia University and Georgia
Tech were implements of revenge:

ful Wildcat crew, both
under their onsJaught. Georgia took

bowing

a goose egg for their score against
the ‘Cat netters, while
Tech was able to grab two vic-
tories from them. The Tech score,

and Cobb has been unbeatable, and
they stand a good chance of going

Cats Lose in Return
Game With Carolina

By MAC RICHARDS

Behind the masterful pitching of
Dean Cassell, veteran Tar Heel
hurler from Union, N. J., the Uni-.
versity of North Carolina shut out
the Wildcats, 9-0, in the final game
of their two-game series. Cassell
was in complete control, giving up
only one hit and fanning ten bat-
ters. Billi Bird, first up in the
seventh, singled sharply over second

for the only Wildcat hit of the

afternoon.

In First Home Match of Season

By BILL ADAMS

Davidson's powerful tennis squad
made their first home appearance,
after a long spring holiday tour.
a memorable one, by soundly
thrashing “the Harvard net squad
9.0, Monday afternon. The white-
wash marked the Cats’ fifth win
in seven starts this spring, the
only two sethacks coming at the
hands of nationally prominent Rol-
lins and Florida.

Sir Derrick ‘“Rarton’s  netters
moved through their northern
neighbors like a finely-edged razor
cutting young fuzz, losing only one
set in the entire match, Captain
Bo Roddey, the Cats’ No.
easily whipped Craig, 6.2, 6-0, in
the feature match. Whit | Cohb
showed the form that elevated him
to the No. 2 post by trouncing the
Harvard captain, Hughes, 6-1, 6-4.
Powerful Teddy Keesler had little
trouble in his match as he belted
Frey off the courts with a 6.1, 6-1,
lacing. Allan Strand, the only soph-

omore singles man for Barton so.

far this year, continued to play
beautiful tennis as he subdued Gor-
don, 6-4, 6.1. Rob I'almer, who
was moved up to No. 5 for the
match, casily beat Bramhall, 6-4.
6-1, while Bill Childs made his
singles debut a successful one by
turning back Reese, 1.6, 6-4, 6-1.

The doubles was simply a con-
tinuation of too much Davidson

power. Roddey and Cobb teamed to
beat Craig and Hughes, 6-2, 6-1;
Teddy Keesler and Strand humbled
Bramhall and Murphy, 6-0, 6-2;
and Allan Fanjoy and Dewey Kees-
‘ter closed the day with a 6-1, 6-3,
triumph over Reese and Bacon.
Barton, who seemed pleased over
the Cats casy win, gave Harvard
an alibi by stating that they hadn’t
been outside for practice very much
due to the weather in Cambridge,
but few observers of the match
felt that even year-round summer
heat in Cambridge could not have
changed the results very much.
A sidelight of the match was the
fact that this was the first time
Davidson and Harvard have met
in athletic competition since Nor-
man Shepard left here to become
athletic director at Harvard.
