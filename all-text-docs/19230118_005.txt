There was a stage star named Celestus
When she danced the applause was tempes-

She whirled and she tripped

And they had to ring down. the asbestos.

Ikey Jones—"P. C., while I was down in
Easley during Christmas I. was out riding
with a girl when the car broke down six
miles from town, and I had to spend the rest
of the evening repairing. What would you
have done ?”

_ P. C. Henderson—*The same thing that
you did, only T wouldn't have lied about it.”

He—Where did you do most of your
skating while learning?

She—I think you're horrid.

Some of the factors determining a girl's
popularity are: _

1—A comfortable parlor.

2—The lighting effects.

3—How hard father is.

+—A first class divan.

5—Last, but not least, no fences to jump
in case we have to run.

A MERRY DRAMA
In Many Acts and Numberless
Scenes

Introducing “The Freshman,” or to speak
campus wise “Fresh,” a verdant member of
'26, who constantly craves information. It
is our resolution that he shall be informed.

Characters: “Mack” Lennox, a rather
prominent senior; he prides himself on the
nobbiness of his wardrobe; it is his private
opinion that he is a veritable lady-killer,

“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and no less
prominent junior; in matter of dress, his
taste is more conservative and substantial;
in regard to his love affairs the old adage,
“Still water runs deep,” is applicable.

Act the Second
STATE OF MIND .

Bill—(reading paper) What you think of
those bootleggers stealing the pickling juice
off the stiffs down in Georgia?

Mac—Reminds me of a little poem I read
the other day; went like this—

Bill—Say, wait a week!

Mac—(Triumphantly )—

“ ’

Gin a body meet a body comin’ hame wi’
rye
Gin a body treat a body, need a body cry?
Every frisky lad has whiskey,
Nane, they say, ha’ve I;
Yet all the neebors smile on me
When comin’ hame wi’ rye!

Bill—Well that5s better than usual; your
taste is improving.
your taste is improving.

Mac—Well, I hope that your taste in hab-
erdashery will improve a bit\then, just to
keep in company.

Bill—Can your comment—but, I haven't
time to keep up with all the fads and tidan-
goes,

Mack—True, whence take my advice:
When you are in need of raiment take thy-
self to a real good house and let them help
you. They know what’s what and will be
only too glad to help you with your selec-
tions;

Bill—That’s true—perhaps you could sug-
gest such a house.

Mack—Sure, glad to, Mellon’s in Char-
lotte is the place I have in mind; they al-
ways have stuff and are only too glad to
help you make a tasteful and correct selec-
tion. :

Bill—Thanks a lot.—(Adv.)

player named Burst. From this union there
are three children, Alice May Burst, John
Wood Burst, and Henry Will Burst.

No, Alice, the Freshmen at Davidson do
not let the grass grow under their feet!

Historical Essays

Didn't study!
Never would!

Passed three hours!
Home for good!

So far.as walking on the grass is con-
cerned the Fresh class have taken for their
motto, “Live and let live.”

On Latin class—‘Mr. Carr transtate
“Caesar sic. dicat on de curan equiesse  lic-
tum.’
» Carr—"Caesar sicked the cat on the cur
and I guess he licked him.”

Before another term rolls around
would like to add the following questions to
the psychological test for Freshmen:
Who climbed the Saturday Evening Post?
Who are the pupils in your eyes?

How high will Balcony have to go before

we

he bursts ?

How far is a mile down the road ?

Does night break when it falls?

Is day destroyed when it breaks?

Hlow fast would we have to drive to keep
time from passing?

The difference between a hair dresser and
a sculptor is that a hair dresser curls up and
dyes while a sculptor makes faces and busts.

This also reminds us that the difference
hetween a woman and a umbrella is that you
can shut an umbrella.

It is rumored that Bascomb Sorrells plans
to return to Davidson next year to specialize
in Latin courses. He intimates that he will
understudy in Golf,

R. O. T. C. NEWS

It has been a question of some discussion
among the authorities of the R. O. T. C. and
the college as to whether the winners in the
rifle shoots should be given college recog-
nition the same as other branches of sport.
This will be up for consideration in the im-
mediate future. ‘There is no doubt that there
will be an abundance of good marksmen
unearthed in the trials and many have al-
ready shown their ability. Tt would reflect
quite a bit of credit upon Davidson should
she put out a winning team.

Another honor that Davidson could pro-
cure is a company of the “Scabbard and
Sheathe,” a national military fraternity. For
its organization five cadet commissioned of-
ficers are required as members and as there
is more than that number on the hill there
should be no trouble in securing a company
here. There are at the present time only
three regiments ‘in the United States, the
fourth one having been started. By apply-
ing now Davidson could secure a company
in this fourth regiment. Major Hearn is
anxious that this be done as it would result
in more outside recognition for the college.

There has been a question of allowing all
R .O. T. C. student to leave off their uni-
forms at the recitation periods, the only re-
quirement being that an increased pridesbe
taken in the appearance during the drill
periods. The question will be open for dis-
cussion among the members of the R. O. T.
C. and it will be decided in the near future.

The sponsors for the various compames
have not been selected this year and it is
hoped that they will be chosen in time for
the company competition drill which will be
held 1en the 11th day of April. The com-

[pany that scores highest in the competitive

drilling will receive the honor flag until the
next year,

The Wednesday afternoon drill periods

have been lately done away with but it is

_still a question as to Whether this will con-

tinue in effect or whether it will be recalled.
After February 28th it will be taken up with
the faculty and with the Senior class as to
the advisability of extending the drill periods
throughout the three days or of having two
hours on Wednesday. The general consen-
sus of opinion is that the students will take
more interest in their drill work when there
are shorter drill periods.

All examinations on R, O. T. C., both
basic and advanced will be held on Wednes-
day, 24th,
