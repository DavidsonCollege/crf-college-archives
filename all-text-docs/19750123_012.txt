Senate Report

Meetze Praised By Resolution
For Action During Belk Flood

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Staff Writer

A. discussion concerning
, Slater Food Service, an over-

view of the winter agenda, and
reports on the student Bill of
Rights and the housing situation
in Davidson were the major
topics, of last Tuesday night’s
Senate meeting.

Also, the Senate unanimously
adopted a resolution com-
mending Physical Plant. Direc-
tor Grover Meetze and three
others for coming to the rescue
of. the dormitory basements
during the recent floodings.

SGA President John Munce
called for a committee to work
with Slater Food Service
Manager Ron Scott. Scott has
made a request for student in-
put into decisions ranging from
changes in food prices to com-
plaints about quality of food.

Munce, who had met earlier
with Scott and Business
Manager Robert Currie, ex-
plained a projected $35 increase
in food service. The increased
rate will become effective in the
fall term next year, and
changes in the food service will
accompany it.

Richard and Bailey houses
will serve a main food fare, but
without steaks. Rusk house will
be closed, and a snack bar in the
Grey Union will serve a com-
bination of sandwiches, hot
dogs, hamburgers, and the like.

Students wil be able to use
meal tickets in the snack bar

from 7 a.m. to7 p.m., but from 8
to 12 p.m. must pay cash.

Senate members raised
questions about the proposed
changes in the Slater Food Ser-
vice; they expressed concern
especially over the mandatory -
cash payment after 7 p.m.

Senators Bo Baskin and Patti
Phillips agreed to explore the
questions raised and report to
the Senate.

The winter agenda covers a
broad variety of topics from
campus planning to a resource
center. trate

At Tuesday’s meeting, Munce
briefly outlined the agenda and
asked the senators to be
thinking about what areas they
want to work in.

Highlights of the agenda in-
clude the following:

(1) An investigation of the
college’s compliance with
health and safety regulations in
dormitories and in the Martin
Chemistry Building.

(2) Continued efforts toward
some kind of campus planning,
particularly in relation to new
housing for students, improved
science facilities, an art
gallery, and new Patterson
Court houses.

(3) Guidance and counseling
including advisor training, ex-
periential learning programs,
and psychological counseling.

(4) An investigation of the in-
firmary’s purpose and
facilities, and coordination with
a crisis line.

(5) An, investigation in poss-

College Repairs Lift

In Effort To Relieve

By MARK WILENSKY
Managing Editor

Replacement of four defec-
tive valves in the college
sewage lift station was begun on
Wednesday afternoon. The
work is expected to be com-
pleted today, and the station
should be working at full
capacity on Friday morning.

Raw sewage has been pouring
directly from college drains in-
to the creek behind the tennis
courts since January 10. On that
day Professor of Biology David
C. Grant noted at 11:51 a.m. the
discharge from the overflow
pipe. “There is no way of
knowing when the flow began;
but it has run steadily since that
time.”

On that same day, Director of
the Physical Plant Grover C.
Meetze Jr. told a reporter that
the system ‘malfunctions for
such short periods that it
wouldn’t be feasible to build a

back-up system. It happens
only a day ortwoa year.”’

Grant agreed that a secon-
dary system was probably im-
practical, but asserted that a
new system would have to be
developed if the college was to
expand at all.

Malfunctioning were four
valves that are supposed to
open and close during the
process of pumping the sewage
uphill toward the town treat-
ment plant. The valves pur-
portedly cost about $200 each.

According to sources in the
Physical Plant Office, the pum-
ps and drain are checked daily.
It is possible for the pumps to be
running wihile the sewage
pours out the drain. The drain
runoff is the only sure way to
detect malfunctioning.

The same valves replaced
this week were not working
properly at the beginning of the
summer. Physical Plant

Munce reported on the status
of the Student By-laws and the
Student. Bill of Rights. The By-
Jaws come up for a final vote
when the Trustees meet in
February and will go into effect
in July. The Bill of Rights has
been deferred to the Trustee
Governance Committee and

students and faculty later this
year, be voted on a final time
next October.

Senator John Guthrie gave a
report on the housing survey he
and several other students con-
ducted in Davidson recently. He
also reported on meetings with
the Davidson Town Council and
with Davidson Mayor Tom
Sadler.

The Senate unanimously
pased the following resolution
of commendation:
