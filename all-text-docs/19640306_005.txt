night. Perhaps it was best summ A

All congratulations along with best wishes are in

At the risk of sounding a bit corn i

since Davidson became a “suitcase college”—a sense of

common interest that overcame fraternal and class

isolation. 2

Two major contributions of this team deserv
appreciation of a great many people in this on Poe:
is general, the other specific. The first contribution is
providing an example of excellence which one rarely
sees or knows first hand. If this year’s basketball team
was sloppy at times, it also was excellent at times. Ex-
cellent as adjudged on a national level—the best there
is—not on any limiting basis.

The second contribution was probably best seen on
the night of the victory over Ohio State, a night on which
every student and member of this college community was

The Southern Conference Wrestling Tournament, scheduled to be held at Dav-
idson in 1964, began this morning at 9 o'clock with weigh-in’s in Johnston Gymnas-
ium. The first set of matches began at 2 o'clock today. Matches are scheduled to be
ry at 8:00 tonight and 2:00 tomorrow with the finals to be held tomorrow night at
8:00.

proud to say he was affiliated with this college. This was
a feeling so strong that a discussion on subsidized ath-
letics was even cancelled. That was a night an athletic
team brought an academic institution a feeling of self-
respect and awareness of identity which it was unaware
it possessed.

These are a couple of the reasons why I would like
to say thank you for this year—a year that, though it
ended dismally, contained probably the biggest athletic
thrills and achievements ever compiled at this college.

AN ALLAMERICAN .. .

Fred Hetzel may have had better shooting nights
ped he never was better than last Friday night. He was
ell.

He continually rolled, bumped and jumped and work-
ed for the ball in an effort to beat VMI. In the process he
scored 41 points, ran through two pivot men and beat a
sagging zone which at times even sagged from the side of

e ball.

In all it was a magnificent performance by a basket-
ball player of great talent and a competitor who didn’t
want to lose.

During this same week Hetzel was named to the
second team on two All-American teams and won the
outstanding player award for the tournament. Last week’s
performance only emphasized the talent these awards
recognized and made more poignant the fact that he will
not show the people of Philadelphia nor even New York
what he has to offer.

WAS THIS THE ONLY WAY?

In the United States only two conferences persist in
choosing their NCAA representatives via the tournament
system—the Southern Conference is one of them.

The arguments for and against such an arrangement
have been trotted onto the printed page countless times.
Briefly the two principle arguments for a tournament are
that it provides an opportunity for a team that starts
slowly and develops into a strong team to reap its just
reward. The second argument is that it provides a great
deal of money for the conference schools.

The argument against a tournament is that it nulli-

have been more dramatic than Davidson's 82-81 loss to VMI a week ago tonight in the
semi-finals of the Southern Conference Tournament at Charlotte

fies a great season in one night; therefore, it makes a
mockery out of regular season play.

Coach Bill Reinhart summed up the argument for both
defense and prosecution in two statements he made last}
week. In one statement he called VMI the best team in|
the Conference and referred to that team as one that!
developed late in the season. On the other hand he readily
admitted that he spent the season preparing his team for
the tournament.

Personally I feel that the arguments advanced for a}
tournament are not as strong as those against this set 5
Yet, the fact remains that while cash returns remain high, |
a tournament will be held.

I would like to suggest some alternate methods of)
selection which would prevent a situation in which the}
Conference was not represented by its best team.

One method would be to play an eight team tourna-
ment in which the regular season champion was not in-|
cluded and have a play-off game or three night series be-
tween the conference champion and tournament cham-
pion.

Another alternative would provide for a_ play-off
game if the Conference Champion and tournament champ
were different teams.

A third alternative would be to further sub-divide})

the NCAA districts much like the NAIA districts. In this}

situation, the Southern Conference Champion, the Atlan-
tic Coast Champion and either one or two teams with the
best records would represent this area.

None of the above was meant to be sour grapes but
some action is needed to rectify a situation in which aj
team could go undefeated, be ranked number one in the)
country and never represent the’conference—if it come}
down with measles at tournament time.

AQUESTION ...

A brief stir of excitement blew through the pines)
this week when the possibility of an NIT engagement)

t

arose. The excitement died along with the possibility. I)
won’t comment whether or not this was good, bad or}

indifferent. a

The decision to prohibit participation by Davidson)
in the NIT was made along the lines of previous confer-
ence policy by the men responsible for this policy. Any
member of a conference must be necessarily willing to}
accept such decisions. Davidson has no complaints.

As an individual though I can’t help wondering why}
the Conference has adopted this policy in the past. The}
story on page one outlined some of the reasons. Yet}
certain questions arise as to why the Missouri Valley Con-
ference is regularly represented in the NIT by a team,
while the champion formally represents the conference}
in the NCAA. And why are the best interests of the con-
ference not served when a conference member is honored
by an opportunity to play in this tournament?

And as another long season ends, just to prove the
work never ends, Coaches Driesell and Hunt are gone—

From their first victory, a 98

to their last game, the VMI loss,
the ‘Cats were worshipped by a
sophisticated campus which oft
en would seem to prefer purga

than show open admiration for

anything.

Though they compiled a 22-4
record, the ‘Cats were not al
ways great while doing it. They
were unsure, tense, and excited
against Wake Forest in their
first Coliseum game on Decem

Hetzel’s conference and school

the most underrated player on
the team, starred on defense all
season and electrified even the
most passive fan with his spec-
tacular drives. Dick Snyder, the
only starting sophomore, was
sometimes sensational, and

rebounder. Like Holland, Snyder
also was on the second squad

guard in Coach Drisell's double

as the regular season closed, he
still forced himself to run, drive,

It would appear that the only
remaining obstacles between the

the SAE’s and the Independents.
Both of these squads hold rec
ords which indicate losses to the
top half of the league and vic
tories over the bottom 5, but
both can be dangerous on a

Only the Kappa Sigs stand a
chance to beat out the front
runners. They have games re
maining with the Phi Delts and
Pi Kapps. While the latter con
test should provide little trauma
for the Sig quintet, the contest
with the Delts could be interest
ing. The Delts, their other re
maining games being with the
SAE's and Sig Eps, will likely
be playing for a share of second
place. Their 2 losses came at
the hands of the Taus and the

The Sigma Chi's, in fifth
place, have lost to everyone
above them in the standings and
have games remaining with the
Pikas and Sig Eps. They appear
to have the best of the schedule
