Christmas provides chance to give
valuable gift of time at vacation

By BILL BARNETT

Editorial Page Editor
As the Christmas season grows
closer and closer, students at David-
son begin to look forward to spending
a couple of weeks at home. The time
off from school is always welcome,
and the parties, presents and other
good times will linger in our minds

long after we return to Davidson.
However, we all need to try to keep
the festivities of Christmas in some
sort of perspective.

Not everyone is as lucky as
students at Davidson. As. a general
rule, students here are not poverty-
stricken nor do they come from
terribly depraved backgrounds. In-

Letter to the Editor

To the Editor:

Possibly the one single quote that I
have heard that best sums up the
conditions in Marburg, West
Germany, as I see them, was aired by
one of the Marburg alumni last year:
“If people knew what it was like over
here, there would be lines in front of
the foriegn studies office all year.”
This year, without a doubt, has been
an extremely valuable and enjoyable
one for me and I think for everyone
involved.

JYA means spending your junior
year away from friends, family,
hometown honey and all the other
things that are so important for your
average Davidson student: E.H.
Little Library, G.P.A., brown nosing
and an inefficient and tetally alumni-
oriented administration. It means
leaving home in late August and
spending ten to.twelve months in the

In response to the financial needs of
our neighbors in our own community
and neighbors in the world commun-
ity, the YM/YWCA and interested
faculty, staff and students are giving
us all the opportunity to share our
prosperity and goodwill through the
1976 Christmas Gift Fund. This
year’s goal is $2000, with the funds
being divided between the Davidson
Community Center and the Farmer’s
Extension Service of Pakistan.

The Davidson Community Center
provides a wide variety of services to
the local community. The Senior
Citizens Hot Meals Program, The
Recreation Program, Junior Achieve-
ment and the New Schoolhouse of the
Arts are the kinds of things that are
always happening at the Community
Center. The Center is supported
through local government funds and
its budget is tight. Our donations will
help toward needed repairs and extra
supplies —things that will benefit
Davidson throughout the year.

reaping the benefits of a superior

Christmas season is a good time to
remember the people who have not
been so fortunate.

country of your choice.
In the beginning, it means a lot of
hard plugesings away at the language.

The intensive language course lasts
for five weeks and at its conclusion
one must take a ‘“‘Sprachprufung’”’ or
language exam to become fully matri-
culated into the university. This is
not a real point of concern, however,
since a person can still earn credits at
four out of nine of the Davidson
students this year failed to pass the
first time around, but they have an
opportunity to try their luck again in
a few weeks from now.

At the conclusion of the intensive
language course, the student is free to
choose from almost any of the courses
offered in the university, though with
plenty of counseling available to keep
one from getting into a course above
his level of German or his level of
preparation in the subject. Once in
the course, the Davidson student, for

Pakistan is an ecumenical church-rel-
ated program. It is not part of the
Pakistani government but is aided by
the Church of Pakistan in its service
to farmer education. The Extension
Center trains field workers to go to
the villages and help farmers to grow
more and better crops. The Extension
Service provides educational and
training materials to small farmers
who actually provide the food for the
poor people in the villages of Pakis-
tan. They need our support to
purchase these materials so that the
hungry people in these small villages
can learn to better provide food for
themselves.

Give to yourself by giving to others
and help our neighbors have a Merry
Christmas. You will be given the

opportunity to do so on Monday and :

volunteers call for your help. Checks

Thank you—and Merry Christmas!

the most part, is treated like any
other German student.

The Davidson students in Germany
live in dormitories with the German
students and the dorms are a selling
point in themselves. Everyone has a

~ private room with kitchens on every
floor. The rooms are small, but nice
and modern and adequately fur-
nished. .

All I wanted to say is that the
opportunity is there and to try to say
how good an opportunity I think it is.
I hope I convinced someone glse so we
can get the lines out in front of the

for charity organizations. Sure, ev-
eryone has a busy Christmas planned,
but doing some volunteer work does
not take much time. All that is
required is waking up at 8:30 or 9:00
instead of 12:30.

The charity organizations which
plan some sort of drive during the
Christmas season are almost too
numerous to name. Most churches
will do something for the poor, and
welcome student support. The Heart
Fund has a chapter in many cities and
usually organizes a Christmas cam-
paign.

Here on campus there are several
projects which would welcome sup-
port. The 1976 Christmas Gift Fund
has recently been organized by the
YMCA and is in need of both
volunteers and contributions. The
CROP program provides a charity
service all year long, and they could
certainly use some extra support at
Christmas. The SAE’s have organ-
ized a Christmas party at the Hun-
tersville Hospital, and hospital offi-
cials have assured them that the
patients welcome any visitors.

The point here, though, is not to
name a bunch of charitable organi-
zations. They are numerous enough
and readily available. The point is
that Christmas should be enjoyed in
the spirit of giving. So many people
have not had the opportunities that
we have, and Christmas provides an
excellent opportunity for us to help
these people out. Helping doesn’t
require much time or money, all it
requires is a little effort.

After thought of

Steve Smith announced late Wed-
nesday afternoon that he was formal-
ly withdrawing his. candidacy for the
office of President of the SGA. Smith
was the first person to announce his
candidacy for the office last week, and
his withdrawal today came as“some-
what of a surprise.

Smith cited several reasons for his
decision. ‘First, I have reconsidered
my responsibilities, and I am afraid I
would not have enough time to do
justice to the job of SGA president. I
will be the Treasurer of the Pika house
next year, and I am already the
chairman of two committees at the
house. I also have plans to run for the
regional vice-presidency of the Pika
fraternity.”’

‘Second, there are two very good
candidates running for the President
of the SGA,” he said. ‘‘Thom Young
seems.to be running an exceptionally
strong campaign. I think that the
SGA will be well run no matter which
candidate wins the election.”’

Smith also said, ‘‘There is only so
much time I can afford to give to any
extracurricular jobs. I do not plan to
let my grades suffer, and I have

responsibilities,
Smith withdraws

simply decided that I would enjoy
working for my fraternity.”

Smith declined to personally en-
dorse either candidate. ‘‘I hope to
continue.working for the SGA in some
capacity after the election, I do not
want to antagonize either Thom or
Roger. I am presently a member of
the Student Conduct Council and
would hate to jeopardize my position
there.’

Upon hearing that Smith would
drop out of the race, Thom Young,
another candidate for the Presidency,
said, ‘‘I feel that Steve’s support
would certainly be a positive force in
my campaign.’’ Roger Brown could
not be reached for comment.
