TOURNEY NOTES... |

The Wildcats rolling on ... West Virginia building its
shaky hopes .... George Washington giving 100° effort
100% of the time ... .VPI crushing pathetic Richmond, . .
William and Mary upsetting Citadel. . . Last year’s final-
ists heing eliminated in the first round... .

The Colisoum crowds. ... the boistrous VPI fans
.... the well-stacked West Virginia cheerleaders. . . .
the kids getting autographs from their heroes, . . Jou
Kruzewski choking back tears as VMI falls behind and
the trainer tells him that he can’t help, .. . coaches
throwing out optimism. .. .the excitement in the air of
the big games that finally count. ; ;

The losers getting their consolation prizes, but
not feeling very consoicd. . . the futility of the looks
on the players who finally realize that they are about
to lose and the season is over... .the excitement of the
winners, which for most will turn to disappointment by
Saturday night.

Few sports events provide the interest and excite-
ment of championship tourneys. They're great fun.

But, os Charlotte News sports editor Ronald Green
said yesterday, “It's still a poor way to choose a champ-

jon.”

e * «¢

Said West Virginia coach George King yesterda
after topping GW, “We will heat Davidson and we w:
win the tournament.”

He will be eating those words by the time this
paper is out, ; ;

Davidson should edge by West Virginia tonight,
VPI will top William and Mary decisively, and then the
‘Cats will crush the Gobblers in the finals.

Bob King, Tech’s 6-11 beanpole sophomore, was
great against Richmond, but he’s not strong enough to
match the ’Cats’ big men. Hetzel will eat him up.

Richmond’s 24.2°: tield goal shooting in the second
half of their game against VPI was the most pitiful l've
ever seen a college team shoot. A good p.e. team could
have beaten them last night.

doe Kruzewski is one tell of a ball player. He
averaged 18.6 points a game this season and always gave
100°. He was the spirit of the VMI team.

Our win was deeisiva oncugh to prove that we
would have won anyway, But | wish he hadn‘t been hurt
go thal we could have had the satisfaction of heating
them at full strength. :

Some systom of seeding in the NCAA Regionals
should be worked out. Something is wrong somewhere
when teams ranked third, fourth, fifth, and sixth in
the nation end up in one bracket, whereas Duke faces
virtually no competition in the other brackel.

Davidson must whip fourth-ranked Providence and
third-ranked St. Joe in order to just get to the Eastern
finals. Duke, or whoever the ACC champ is, has to
beat the winner of the game between Penn State and
the Ivy League champion in order to get there.

Three Southorn Conferance schools fielded soccer
teams Inst fall, and Davidson's win over Furman waa the
only contest between league teams, thus making David-
son's booters the unofficial conference champions.

So just for the record:

Southern Conference Seecer Standings
Davidson 1 0 1,000
Wast Virginia 9 6 -000
Furman 0 1 000
| Actually, soccer coach Harry Fogleman, is trying
| to arrange a round-robin tournament with these teams
and East Carolina, if the Pirates fietd a team next year,
in order to determine an official championship.
