The 1 news media has spread

the name of Davidson College

_into many.parts of the country

with its coverage of the case of
Dr. Ronald Linden.

“In the ten years that I’ve
been here,’’ said Director of
News and Photography Earl
W. “Buck’’ Lawrimore, ‘‘there
has never been anything that
brought as many media tele-
phone calls.’’

Lawrimore listed a number
of media organizations that
have contacted him seeking
information about the circum-
stances of the Linden case.

The Charlotte Observer was
one of the first to contact
Lawrimore. A front page arti-
cle appeared on April 23, with
another-follow-up front-page
article, an: editorial, and a
commentary on April 27.

The Raleigh News and Ob-
server, New York Post, Wash-
ington Post, New York Times
and. the Philadelphia Inquirer
have covered the story.

The Associated Press in
Raleigh <distributed it

throughout the Eastern Uni-

ted States, whet acai as” 1m

it was sent all over the
country,” said Lawrimore.

WBT—TV and the NBC
ppt news did spots on the

A and the Chronicle
of Higher n, the Reli-
gious News Service, and the
Daily Princetonian (Prince
ton’s student paper) called
Lawrimore for information.

Lawrimore said that he
relayed a statement to those
requesting information while
“‘many had additional ques-
tions which I tracked down
answers for.

“IT read them the relevant
bylaws...and in capsule the
course of actions that fol-
lowed,...we did not release
anything about Linden’s letter
until Linden released that
information tothe Washing-
ton Post.

Lawrimore spoke of ‘‘mix-
ed” emotions toward the press
coverage.

“Unfortunately some have
tried to simplify it to being
anti-semitic. In the long run,
the college would have been
better with no publicity at all
on this,” said Lawrimore.

s consulted with

“Counsel concluded that
-Linden’s acceptance failed to
fulfill a key condition of the
offer—that condition being
that Linden would “genuinely
want to join such a community
and would uphold and seek to
‘increase the effectiveness of
the college as a church-related
college’,’’ said Dagenhart.

‘Counsel talked at some
length with Dr. Spencer about
the visit of Dr. Linden to
Davidson and their conver-
sation in the interview,’ he
continued. z

“Counsel wanted to find out
whether Linden was repeating

in the letter what he had said ©

in the interview about Chris-
tian tenure, or whether the
statement in the letter was

something di
“Fhere-was uestion that
the statement in the letter was

different,’’ said Dagenhart.

Dagenhart commented, ‘I
don’t believe the letter would
have been written offering
Linden the job if he, in his
interview, had expressed dis-
agreement with Christian ten-
ure in the terms expressed in
the acceptance letter.’’

The letter rescinding Lin-

Several articles in the nat-
ional media have hinted that
Davidson might face censure
from professional academic so-

funding because of the Linden
Dagenhart said, ‘‘I have
had no contacts from any

‘professional group, and I do

not know of any investigations
going on.’’ Any discussion of
the impact of the Linden case
on government funding would
be “‘in the realm of conjec-
ture.”

Spencer said that “‘the anti-
Semitic slant in some of the
media coverage is most unfor-
tunate because it will hurt
Davidson. The anti-Semitic
slant is completely inaccurate.

“The legal opinion based on
the language of Linden’s letter
