Cumming's Book

Now Published

By LARRY SMITH
Davidsonien Staff Reporter
Dr. William P. Cumming’s new book, “The South-
east in Early Maps,” was officially released February
21, 1958. The Princeton University Press in Princeton,
New Jersey, published the book, which sells for $12.50.

The book contains 52 pages
of text (Introductory Essay), 25
pages of footnotes, 153 pages
of List of Maps. It also includes
over 30 pages of miscellaneous
indexes, appendixes, and infor-
mation, making a total of 275
pages, not counting the 64 ad-
ditional pages of maps.

In his book, Cumming does a
study and descriptive bibliog-
raphy of the historical cartog-
raphy of the southeastern por-
tion of North America during
colonization and discovery, be-
fore the American Revolution.

By analyzing manuscripts
and printed maps from that
area, he shows expanding geo-
,8raphical knowledge through
periods of exploration and set-
.tlement, relating primary docu-
ments to other reports and rec-
ords of the time.

Prof. Cumming discusses ear-
ly explorers’ misconceptions of
the continent, the frontier
growth, history of imperialistic
efforts of France, Spain.
