Contributers this weal: Davee - Tierney,

fraternity president, but the
decision as to whether “they
will retain their charter will
be made by the national or-
ganization.

‘I am not sure the chart- ~

er issue is this chapter's
choice to make,”’ said Parks.
“Although our hational has
not made a decision yet, I
am not optimistic that they
will allow us to keep our
charter.

“Our national was upset
about the-whole thing. They
even encouraged us to go
off campus. But there is a
large faction in the fraterni-
ty that like the new pro-
posal and want to remain in
the system,” he said.

‘Pi Kappa Alpha President
‘Gary ‘Cash said that his fra-

ternity met with two direc”

tors of ithe national organi-
zation this week and that the
iPika’s will vote on the col-
lege’s proposal Monday.
“The national . directors
who came down this week
realize the situation in

which ‘this fraternity is in-,

volved,’’ said Cash. ‘"They
recognize that we are not
trying to fight the national
organization, but rather that
we are trying to work out
the best thing we can under
the system imposed by the
college.”’

Cash said that the nation-
al directors gave their en-
dorsement for ‘Pika’s to keep
their charter under the new
system but the final deci-
sion will be made by the
Supreme Council of the na-
tional organization.

“We decided to wait to
vote on the college’s pro-
posal in order that each
member could evaluate the
comments made by the na-

“I believe that whatever

this chapter decides, the na-
tional ‘will be a8 lenient. ds
they can: They understand
we are undér pressure from
the collége.”’

Pi Kappa Phi voted to ac.
cept the college plan and
remain in their house; how-
ever, they were to consider
the question of their charter
last night, according to Fra-
ternity President John _Bar-
bee. f

“As the situation .now
Stands, the college plan is
in direct violation of the na-
tional constitution, but the
national fraternity is con-
templating a change~ in
these rules,’ he said.

“Basically we like Spen-
cer’s proposal to eliminate
Selectivity. We have been
‘against this Yer the last two
or three years,” Barbee said.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon vot-
ed unanimously to accept
the college plan; kéep their
charter, and remain in ‘their

house, according to Ted
Ravenel, fraternity - presi-
_ dent.

* Ravenel noted that the na-
tional organization will act

on a proposal this summer

which would allow for ‘A ©

simple plurality vote of the
members in order for a per-
son to receive a bid.

“A national representative
said that the anti-fraternity
movement
other campuses; consequent-
ly the national organization
may agree to the college
plan as a sort of experi-
ment,’” said Ravenel.
‘Sigma Chi voted to’ reject
the college proposal and_to
cease operations at the close
of this academic year, ac-
cording to Rick Weddle, fra-

- ternity president.

“Our house has a strong
fraternity tradition,’ said
Weddle. ‘‘Since this frater-
nity is one of the smallest
on Campus, we feel we would
be severely diluted by the.
number of freshmen. which
would come here.”

“We felt it was more im-
portant to have.a good year
and finish rather than go
half way and mess up ‘the
system,” he said.

Weddle noted that Sigma

Chi presently ‘has no sopho-

mores and only eight juniors.
The majority of the fraterni-

is spreading: to’

“ty is composed of 12 seniors.
Sigma. Nu President Mark
Hallenbeck said that his
fraternity voted to accept the .
college plan, relinquish their
charter, and remain in their

house.

“Since we didn’t feel we
could afford to move off cam-
pus, and since the people
here wanted to remain to-
gether, we decided to accept
the plan,” he said.

“Hallenbeck noted that
his fraternity has a selectivi-
ty clause in its constitution;
consequently, he did fot
feel the national organization
would allow them to retain
their charter,

Sigma Phi Epsilon will
vote on the ‘college's pro-
posal Monday, according to
Fraternity President Dave
“The main reason we are
waiting,” said Shepler, ‘‘is

_ that we wanted to get the

feeling of the freshmen dur-
ing rush on how they felt
about moving — off. campus.

“‘We also want to check on
some of the specific mechan-
ics involved if we in fact

, did decide to continue oper-

ations off campus,” he said.

In Admissions Decisions,

Coble Asks Student Voice

By GRAY WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor
SGiA President Ran Coble
has“ a new plan to put stu-
dent representatives on the
admissions committee at
Davidson,
He said that the same ad-
missions proposal which was

- Closes Reserve

ed—‘‘very reluctantly,” ac-
cording to director Chalmers
G. Davidson—to discontinue
the Open Reserve and place
all the Open Reserve books
in-Closed-Reserve.

According to Davidson,
students were ‘‘just walking
out with books’’ instead of

checking them out or using
them in the reference room

- of the library as they should.

Davidson added that this
was. ‘‘not really stealing,”
but did cause considerable
delay and inconvience for
others who need to use the
books in question.

Davidson said that the
reference room policy is
“‘an experiment,” and that
“if students feel they’ve lost
“something, we'll be open to
suggestions” for _improve-
ments. hac

He voiced hopes. that the
Davidson library would not
have to hire a policeman to
frisk students on the way
out of the library, as Har-
‘ard University and certain
other ‘schools have done.
. Davidson said that the
Library Planning Commis-
sion will have an announce-

_ment to make soon on the

new library, but that the
committee

return from Europe to okay

~ their conclusions first.”

intends to wait.

rejected last spring by the
faculty will be resubmitted
because of new information

on other schools with stu- -

dent-faculty admissions com-
mittees and because the

handling of the proposal last

year was rushed.

According to Coble, ‘‘We
were near exams, and fa-
culty tempers with students
were very short. There were
even some faculty members
who were disturbed about
the manner in! which ‘the
proposal was _presented.”’

The basic objections to
the proposal last year were
that high school guidance
counselors would not send
recommendations if students
were on the committee and
that student representatives
would not keep the records
confidential.

Coble added,, ‘Right now
we are in the process of try-
ing to find schools compar-

able to Davidson with ad-
missions proposals. We have
been working with Mr. White
to-form a questionnaire.”
Coble stated that 13 other
schools were being checked,
including Colgate, Berkeley,
Emory, Amherst, Hamilton,
, Reed, Pomona, and Oberlin.
He mentioned that , Oberlin
had run into difficulties over
its admissions proposal, and
that an understanding of
the problems ,there would
benefit the handling of the
proposal at Davidson. 5
Acceptance for the propos-
‘al would inyolve a change in
the faculty * constitution, In
the absence of college Pre-
sident Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. and Vice president for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan, both of whom are
presently abroad, the  pro-
posal can only be initiated
by ten per. cent of the vot-
ing faculty in residence.

(Continued From Page 1)
said Burts.

Approximately 170 fresh- ~

men out of a class of 290 had
signed up ‘to participate in
the rush program. - ‘‘We
were pleased with this re-
sponse considering that only
one third of the fraternities
at Davidson participated,”
said Parrigin.

: Informal rush Parties were
held Monday and Tuesday
evenings during which parti-
cipating freshmen visited all
four of tthe fraternities, ac-
cording to Parrigin. Then on
Wednesday these freshmen

received the names ofthe

fraternities who had given
them redates, and the fresh-

men returned the names of
‘those fraternities which they
preferred to revisit.
Thursday and Friday were
the redatte parties where the
fresimmen visitéd fraternities
as second and third time. -
Six fraternities originally
agreed to participate in the
informal rush program.
These groups included Alpha
Tau Omega, Kappa Alpha,
Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta
Theta, Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon, and Sigma Phi Epsilon.
Since ‘the program was in-
tiated, | wo fraternities,
