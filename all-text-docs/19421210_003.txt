Having been

raised in pre-season Write-ups as the most promising aggrega-
ion of recent-vearsythey had to prove it; and by winning a
convincing victory over the Cannon basketeers they demon-
strated that Davidsonians are not likely to be disappointed in

their record for the season.

The ’Cats looked particularly good on offense
with Sophs Tom Peters and Jim Lowry racking up
most of the points. Outstanding were the fast breaks

for the basket.

Coach Shepard commented on the

excellent work in retrieving the rebounds from the

backboard.

He cited this feature as a failing of

Davidson teams of the past few years and pointed out
that Duke and Carolina always account for a large
percentage of their points in this manner.

Davidson showed weakness at times on defense as

Hicks

and company matched the ’Cats point for point in the second

halt.

charges hard this week to improve their defensive play. Co

as did George Peters, but Long John seemed to
have momentarily lost his eve for the basket.

“Feets” Currie,

Pat Williams, Jack Byrd, and John Frederick stood out among
the reserves as every man in uniform saw action.

It will be hard to predict from the opening game
how the ’Cats will stack up against conference opposi-
tion, but the Kannapolis team was first class opposition
for a starter. First chance for comparison with a Big
Five team will be the game with McCrary tonight,
as the Eagles lost to the Carolina White Bantams

by only one point.

Friday’s game was a rough and tumble affair resulting in
a broken tooth for Tommy Peters and a bloody nose for Bob
Currie as J. D. Hicks, former Wildcat star, used his elbows to

good advantage.

McEver Praised
We received an interesting clipping from a Nash-
ville paper from former Davidsonian }Sports Editor
Andy Dale, who is now a medical student at Vanderbilt

University.

In commenting on Frank Sinkwich’s re-

ceiving the Heismann Trophy for this year, the col-
umnist cited Gene McEver, All-American Tennessee
gridder and head coach at Davidson. now, as being,
in his opinion, back in the South of all time. This is

noteworthy recognition.

by many as the chief contender for this honor.

Sinkwich has been appraised

But

the Nashville scribe was convinced of the soundness
of ‘his. choice in recalling not only McEver’s ability
to pick a hole and charge through it, but also his
prowess at the art of broken-field running. This is
just another reminder of the talent we have to mould
the fortunes of the Wildcat gridiron warriors.

White has served Davidson’s athletic
organizations in such a taithtuband

efficient manner while performing
his duties as trainer thtat—he has
rightfully deserved the tithe of

Davidson's true “unsung hero.”

Born and teared on the outskirts

of this little college community,

Here he became somewhat of a

Foremost in his memory was the
elusive Mackorell, threading his
way through a broken field, and

ing leader. Not to be forgotten was

the conferénce tourney in 1939.

Although “Doc” claims that base

ball, ‘the ‘national pastime}. is. his
favorite sport, he nevertheless. be-
lieves that. football has afforded

him his greatest thrill. During the
past season, a hitherto scorless Da-
vidson eleven snapped out of their
scoring lethargy to smash the highly
touted V.M.I. Cadets and give “Doc”
his biggest thrill.

Looking back over his nine year
stay at Davidson, “Doc” paid trib-
utt to the boys with whom he has
been associated by making the
statement that he has never seen a
single boy that he didn’t like. These
same boys likewise admire “Doc”
White, who, with each passing day,
is contributing a bit more of his un-
selfish and invaluable work.

Four Wildcat stars of the gridiron shown here have turned

four will see plenty of action during the coming season.
