According to Who's Who, William
Joseph Martin was born in Columbia,
Tenn,, February 10, 1868. When he
was a year old, his father moved with
his family to Davidson, N.C. Dr. Mar-
tin received his A. B. degree from Da-
vidson College in 1888, his A. M. in
1894; M. D. from the University of
Virginia, 1890; Ph.D. in 1894; LL.D.
from Central University and Wake
Forest College in 1913.

He was professor of Science. in the
Presbyterian ‘College of South Carolina
1888-9; adjunct professor of Science at
Davidson 1890-91; instructor in Chem-
istry at the University of Virginia
1892-96; Chambers professor of Chen.

istry at Davidson 1896-1912; Burser
1896-09; Proctor 1908-12: President
1912—. He was moderator of the

General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church in the United States in tgrg.
He is a member of ‘the execeutive com-
mittee of the Laymen's Missionary
Movement of the Presbyterian Church
L. S$. Dr. Martin is a member of the
American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science and alsv of the Ameri
can Chemical Society. He is a member
of the Beta Theta Pi. and Phi Beta
Kappa (University of Virginia Chap-
ter) fraternities.

As professor of Chemistry at David-
son, Dr. Martin performed a great ser-
vice to the college. His thorough and
wide acquaintance with his subject, his
facility in imparting his knowledge, and
his faithful painstaking work combined
to make him one of Davidson's most
admired professors. He was singularly
successful, his students showing always
the results of careful, scholarly instruc-
tion.

In 1912, Dr. Martin succeeded Dr.
Henry Louis Smith as president of Da-
vidson College. In the eight years since
he became chief executive of the Col-
lege, the student body has increased more
than twenty-five per cent. During this
time, two professors have beén added to
the faculty; and the pastor of the Pres-
byterian Church has taken up work in
the English department. Largely as a
result of Dr. Martin's work, approxi-
mately $100,000 was added to the en-
dowment fund of the college in 1914.
He was also influential in starting the
present campaign for $1,000,000 ¢n-
dowment for Presbyterian Colleges in
North Carolina. The new gymnasium
is another valuable addition to the equip-
ment of the college which has been made
in Dr. Martin’s administration.

With the exception of the period of
the war, Dr. Martin’s term of office
has been characterized by a_ steady
growth of the College. He has become
known over the entire Southern Pres-
byterian Church fer his devotion to the
College and his zeal for its welfare. On
the campus, throughout the State and
the South, Dr. Martin is recognized as
a power for good, as a representative of
the best type of constructive leadership.

The College is proud to claim him as
one of her most distinguished alumni,
and her present chief executive.

WHO'S IN FAVOR OF A
LYCEUM PROGRAM.

This fall everything, points to a col-
lege year like we used to have in ante-
bellum days. “he best: features of the
old college activities will be retained
while others not worthy of past war ac-

- ‘tivities will be thrown aside.

Davidson in years past has been able
to pet a real clean and live lyceum pro-
gram on the Hill. ‘The program ren-
dered was always helpful, whether it
was classical or of a lighter nature.
Aside from the pleasure viewpoint it was
for the betterment of: the student body.
With the live student body we have this
year we should by all) means have a
good lyceum,

to have one. “Phink about it. It's up
to you.
