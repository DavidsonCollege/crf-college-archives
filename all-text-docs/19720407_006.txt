Part III: Proposals For Coeducation

On the basis of our study of
coeducation and of the condi-
tions under which it ‘could best
be achieved, we recommend the
following plan for coeducation
at Davidson College. Subsections
18 constitute a suggested sche-
dule for the admission of ad-
ditional women students at
Davidscn.

1. In order to inaugurate co-
education at Davidson on a
significant scale at the earliest
opportunity. admit up to 100
women transfer students for the
autumn of 1972. Maintain an en-
rollment of 1000 men.

2. Begin the full implementa-
tion of coeducation with the ad-
mission of freshmen women
students for the autumn of
1973. Admit up to 40 freshmen
women students for the autumn
of 1973, plus up ic 10 additional
upperclass women transfer stu-
dents.

3. For the autumn of 1974,
admit up to 75 freshmen women
students, plus up to 35 addi-
tional upperclass women trans-
fer students.

4. For the autumn of 1975, ad-

mit up to 75 freshmen women
students. plus up to 25 addi-
tional upperclass women trans-
fer students.

5. For the autumn of 1976, ad-
mit up to 75 freshmen women
students. By the year 1976, the
numbers of women students in
each of the four classes would
be approximately equal. Wo-
men students would, by this
time, normally be admitted to
the college as freshmen, just as
the men are.

Upperciass women transfer
students would, however, be ad-
mitted in whatever numbers
were required to keep the num-
ber of women in each class up
to the projected numerical
level. The total number of wom-
en students on campus by 1976
would be 300. and tiie total en
rollment. 1.300.

6. Appoint additional mem-
bers of the faculty at the rate
of approximately two a year,
beginning in 1973. This expan-
sion in the faculty should be
used as an opportunity for in-
creasing significantly the num-
ber of women faculty members

able way to become coeduca-

tional. there was broad agree-—

ment.

Plan 4, calling for an in-
creased enrollment by admitt-
ing from three to five hundred
women students, while keeping
the number of men students at
approximately the present level.
was the preference of the larg-
est number of respordents in
each group.

A good deal of concern was
indicated on the part of faculty
and alumni that the student-
faculty ratio, the endowment
per student, and the educational
and general expenditure per
student not be affected adverse-
ly by coeducation.

At the same time, there was
a significant proportion of each
group apparently willing to con-
tribute towards the capital ex-
penses which would be involved
in becoming coeducational:
33.3% of the faculty, 47.4% of
the administrative staff, 55.8‘
of the students, and 43.8% of
the alumni.

As to when Davidson should
become coeducational, only a
minority in each group felt that
the college should wait until the
total amount of money required
for coeducation had been raised.

The level of annual giving
would apparently not be much
affected if the college became
coeducational.

The largest number of respon-
dents in each group indicated
that the level of their annual
giving would remain about the
same. (See the Comparative
Summary of the Questionnaires,
February, 1972.)

The subcommittee also met
with the Coeducation Commit-
tee of the Student Government
Association Senate, Reginald E.
Kennedy °73, Chairman, and
David F. Smith °73, Publicity
Chairman.

An open meeting of the sub-
committee was held in the Stu-
dent Union, attended by some

75 students, which gave us an
opportunity to sound out stu-
dent opinion more fully.

Ralph A. Peeples ‘73, newly-
elected President of the Student
Government Association, has
kept in close touch with the
subcommittee.

It was partly through Mr.
Peeples that volunteer student
help was recruited to tabulate
the large number of alumni
questionnaires which were re-
ceived.

The Chairman of the Educa-
tional Policy Committee and the
members of the subcommittee
have conferred with Mr. C.
David Cornell, Vice President
for Finance and Development
at Davidson College: with Mr.
Robert W. Davidscn. Comptrol-
ler of Davidson College, and
with members of the Budget.
Buildings, and Grounds Commit.
tee regarding the costs involved
in possible plans for coeduca-
tion.

The Educational Policy Com-

mittee has come to the conclus-

ion, after considering the sub-
ject since September, 1971, that
it is not only desirble and feasi-
ble for Davidson College to be-
come coeducational, but that it
is imperative for the college to
do so at the earliest possible
time.

The arguments for coeduca-
tion from an educational point
of view seem to us overwhelm-
ingly convincing. All segments
of the Davidson community —
faculty, administrative staff,
s:udents, and alumni — desire
coeducation for Davidson.

From a financial point of view
coeducation has proven feasible
at colleges comparable to Da-
vidson.

The trend over the past five
years of men’s colleges becom-
ing coeducational leaves David-
son at present in a very small
and, to all appearances, dimin-
ishing minority.

We think the time to begin is
with the autumn of 1972.

at Davidson. If this plan :s fol-
lowed. the student-faculty ratio
will no rise above 13:1 (com-
pared to a present ratio oF
Me).

7. The five-vear plan for co
education described above can
be represented on a table as
follows. Note that after the first
year of coeducation. women are
added —over the total of the pre-
vious year—at a rate of 50 a
year. The enrollment of men
remains constant at 1000.

8. During the next five vears.
i.e. the period from 1977 to
1981. increase the enrollment
to a total of 15000. composed of
1000 men and 500 women. This
can be achieved by increasing
the number of women students
by approximately 40 a year dur-
ing this period.

This would bring the total
number of women students on
campus to 500 by 1981. while
keeping the number of men
Students at the present level
of 1000.

9. In so far as possible, the
total amount of scholarship aid
available to students should be
increased as the total enroll
meat -is increased.

We are aware that if scholar-
ship aid is to be continued to
be made available to students
on anything like the present
basis, additional capital funds
will have to be raised for scho-
larship purposes.

Raising additional funds for
scholarships should, in our
opinion. be included as a prior-
ity item in fund-raising plans
by the development office.

10. Housing for women stu-
dents could be provided in the
first year by using all or part
of one of the present domitor-
ies for the accomodation of wo-
men, and by allowing as many
as possible of the displaced men
to live off-campus.

Some men may have to be
accommodated in three - man
rooms in the dormitories. If a
reduction in 100m rent were of-
fered to those sharing a three-
man room it would probably
ease the problem of finding men
students willing to share a room
ca this basis.

1. For the autumn of 1973,
additional dormitory space
could be converted to accomo-
dations for women _ students.
The displaced men_ students
would then have to be accom.
modated in three-man rooms.

During the two years 1972.
74, housing units should be built

without delay to accommodate
the incieased enrollment in the
college.

These facilities should pro-
vide a variety of living arrange-
ments. and should be built to
accommodate both men and wo-
men students. By the autumn of
1974. when these faciliies should
be ready, it would be possible
to eliminate entirely the over-
crowding of the previous two
rears.

We recommend investigating
the availability of low-interest
government loans for these fa-
cilities.

The possibility should be con-
sidered of including dining fa-
cilities. for which government
loans are also available, in the
rew buildings which are erected.

12. Additional housing and
dining facilities would be built
as needed to accommodate the
additional students who would
be added to the enrollment in
succeeding years. Again, we
recommend censidering low-
interes. government loans.

13. In the first year—ie., for
the autumn of 1972—a woman
administrator should be = ap-
pointed with special responsi-
bilities for coeducation. She
would be expected not only to
help advise women students at
Davidson bu: to help plan and
implement coeducation at the
college in vears to come.

This person, we feel, would
be essential for the successful
realization of this plan for co-
education. We do not foresee at
the moment any need for addi-
tional women members of the
administrative staff.

14. Though this would not be
required for the autumn of 1972,
the infirmary and health ser-
viees should be expanded to
accommodate the increased en-
rollment which is foreseen here.

The analysis of the President’s
Study Commission on Coeduca-
tion. which called for two ad-
ditie ‘al nurses and an increase
in the number of beds fiom. 21
to 30, should provide a_ useful
suide to what is meeded in this
area.

14. An adequate Student Union

already in the preliminary
planning stage- should be built
as quickly as possible, or an
existing building (possibly the
present library) renovated for
this purpose.

The experience of other col-
leges suggests that a student
center is crucially important

once coeducation is under way.

We feel that a union in a sin.
gle, centrally-located building
would be far more satisfactory
than scattered facilities.

16. From all indications, the
securizy force already needs to
be expanded for 1972-73, and
this will be all the more neces.
sary if the above plan for co-
education is followed.

As a less expensive alterna-
tive to hiring additional full-
time security personnel, we
urge that the possibility be can.
vassed of hiring students, pos-
sibly those on work - study
grants, to work under the su-
pervision of experienced secur.
ity personnel at designated
veriods in the evening.

We are also conscious of the
way in which dark areas of the
campus exacerbate the security
problem.

Rather than atiempting to
blanket the campus with light,
we think it more desirable to
place a few well-situated lights
at the poinis of gieatest need:
e.g., to the north of the Union
and to the south and west of
the Guest House.

17. We see no urgent neces-
sity for expa:ding the gym-
nasium or ihe physical educa
tion staff for the advent of co
education. Other colleges have
found men_ instructors — satis.
factory for women students.

We note that ‘here is already
a dressing room for women ii
the gymnasium. This room
should be fitted up with addi-
tional locke:s in preparation
for increased use by. women in
the next five years.

18. Finally, nothing in this
plan should be ucderstood as
precluding the possibility of de-
veloping closer relations be-
tween Davidson College and
Queens College.

Present arrangements for ex-
changes of students should be
continued, ard once this plan
is «adopted Queens _ students
mee.ing our requirements would
be considered eligible to trans-
fer here.

The appropriate officials at.
Queens College have been kept
informed about our delibera
tions on coeducation and discus-
sions are continuing with them.

The way should be kept open
for proposals whereby the two
colleges can cooperate more
fully in their academic endca-
vors in the years to come.
