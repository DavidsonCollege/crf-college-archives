Innovations In Admissions System
Needed To Silence Many Critics

Admissions is the most controver-
sial problem of Davidson College. For
the past three weeks the DAVID-
SONIAN has looked at this problem.

We have found that there is ‘a
great deal of interest jin the admis-
sions question on the -of students
as well as alumni and/gdministration.

Probably no phase of administra-
tive activity is more discussed with
less accurate information. It is our
purpose to supply some of this infor-
mation and clear up some common
misconceptions regarding admissions.

Most student unrest over admis-
sions seems to be concerned with the
quality of freshmen admitted each
year. We disagree with this feeling.
After looking into admissions we do
not question the ability of those ac-
cepted to Davidson. The Admissions
Committee can defend to the man
those they have accepted—on their
records.

We feel that the mistakes bein
made in admissions are mistakes of
omission, not commission. We are
satisfied with the men being accepted.
We are disturbed over some of those
who have been refused admittance.

The DAVIDSONIAN makes the
following recommendations for seri-
ous consideration by the administra-
tion:

Presidential Appointment
Of Admissions Committee
As the one most irene

ested in, and responsible for, wel-
fare of Davidson College, the presi-
dent should have appointative power
over the Committee on Admissions.
President Martin has pointed out
that the student body is the real
measure of greatness in a school. By
appointative power of the Admissions
Committee the president can exercise
an indirect control over admissions,
and he can more readily instill his
philosophies into admissions.

Personal Interviews

Although we agree that the Ad-
missions Committee can defend all
of the men they receive on the basis
of their previous academic records,

we feel that personal interviews with

a

all applicafits would help to eliminate
some whose records seem worthy but
wha do not fit in at Davidson.

is system of interviews elimi-
nates 0 the few extreme cases
which now give basis to student cri-
ticism, it will be worthwhile.

Péeides these advantages, being
abié to have all applicants visit Da-
vidson will enable us to try to “sell”
them and thus get a higher percent-
age of men admitted to actually en-
ter. school.

Early Decisions On
Outstonding Students

Under this system we can better
compete with other schools for the
potentially exceptional student.
There is great competition in edu-
éational circles for this type of man.
By accepting him in the fall of his
senior year we may be able to obtain
from him a more definite commit-
ment. Other schools are doing this;

e should meet the competition.

igher Evaluation Of
Past Ties With The College

As the most subjective phase: of
admissions evaluations this will be
perhaps the most difficult to admini-
ster, but by no means the least im-
portant.

It is for refusing admission to
some who fall into this category that
the admissions program is most cri-
ticized.

We recommend that personal ties
be made a mite important criteria of
evaluation. These are often much
more important than a list of extra-
curriculars assiduously collected by
aspiring Davidsonians.

Our first recommendation that
the president appoint the Admissions
Committee will expedite the judicious
discharge of this duty. He will ap-
point men best qualified to make
such a subjective decision based on
their knowledge of Davidson College.

We should remember that David-
son is more than an intellectual fac-
tory; Davidson is a way of life. Only
through proper admittance can we
keep our way of life.

Justification

going up and down this country

too much. I shall not stop that preach-

Double Standard
For The South

Finally, in the closing minutes of
his chapel talk last week, Dr. Max
Polley told us what we already knew
full well. He remarked that the pro-
blems of the South were like unto
those of South Africa, on which he
had harangued at length.

We really didn’t need the hint.
The allegory was quite obvious from

‘background and his heritage.

the outset. The purpose was even
more glaring. ,

We are increasingly aware of,
and disturbed by, a double-standard
used by Dr. Polley and imposed by
the northern press under which the
South must labor.

The hero of the not-so-subtle ai-
legory, Trevor Huddleston, was
praised for his protestations against
a system he sincerely believed to be
wrong. We were told that he showed
true courage in placing himself out-
side the law for this great cause of
his.

Let a Southerner protest against
a system which he believes to be

wrong. Damnations are heaped upon:

him for his same devotion and sin-
cerity of purpose. Let a Southerner
place himself outside the law in pro-
test and he will be met not with
praise but with bayonets.

Dr. Polley is from a far-removed
section of the country. He is the first
to admit that. he cannot forget his
Nor
can we. Nevertheless we are often
admonished to lay aside those things
we hold sacred‘and in which we sin-
cerely believe. We must not.

DAVIDSON NOTE BOOK

Manufacture Of Freshman
“Gentlemen” is Blasted

Editor's Note: This is the first of a continuing series
of columns written by two Davidson students who havs
requested that their names not be affixed to their work.

Though granting anonymity to writers is generally
against the policies of THE DAVIDSONIAN, the editors

feel that the merits justify an exception in this case.

During her illustrious history Collegii Davidsonen-
sis has borne two great distinctions. First, Woodrow
Wilson, who studied here, gained in a single academic
year that great background of democracy, religion, and
scholarship through which he so nobly distinguished his
high office. Secondly, she has instilled into a century
of young men those qualities of a gentlemen which have
enabled them to become the leaders of the South.

So efficiently does the college perform the latter
duty that we think it only appropriate to record here
the philosophy of The Making of a Gentleman.

First, take 2 young freshman, statistically more ablé
than his predecessors, and subject him to an archaic,
worthless set of regulations, abandoned years ago by
other colleges. ‘gs

Second, humiliate him at great length. This teaches
him that snobbery, disdain, and insensitivity are quali-
ties which he must adopt in order to be a gentleman, as
seen in those called upperclassmen.

Third, since we are a Christian college, make it
plain to him that our Christian justification in perpetua-
ting unreasonable practices lies in that irrefutable piece
of reasoning, They did it to me. This standard is more
easily ‘recognized and accepted when we call it by its
proper name, Tradition.

Fourth, style your regulations such that they will
cudgel the freshman out of originality and idealism in-
to relinquishing these characteristics for the more —
sophistocated traits of duliness and conservatism ex-
emplified in the masses. Eliminate individuality, culti-
vate mediocrity, and soon that tragic and oft-repeated
pronouncement on the individualist, He does not fit in,
will wholly disappear.

Fifth, if the freshmen show signs of obeying the
regulations, then encourage them to riot. This builds
Class Unity and Spirit.

Lastly, if the system of enforcement shows signs
of weakening, give no consideration to the fact that
it may be basically wrong, but make it authoritative and
efficient. Remember, there is no wrong like the well-
administered wrong.

ay!

Most of us couldn’t be at Da-:

indeed Milton Gee Is rep-
resented (or misrepresented)
as one having eccomplished
the impossible because be
hes strongly encouraged 8
Gung-Ho attitude emong the
frosh, an attitude which is
naturally inherent in most
freshman personalities any-
way.

You seem to say that because
Gee is undoubtedly a master of
the art of group manipulation,
it follows that he has done
something positive for the
freshmen and the school as a
whole by carefully channeling
every ounce of freshman en-
thusiasm into certain ‘“‘pre-
scribed” areas where it is cer-
tain to grow languid, cynical
and senile after so many weeks.

To be sure | am not chal-
lenging the evident fact of
Gee's efticient and generally-
successful endeavor to stin-
ulate “school spirit’, but !
am rather objecting to the
empty praise of something
not essentially praiseworthy.

Since the Class of '63 arrived,
it has been asked and even
commanded to conform to
rules, policies, customs, tradi-
tions, ideals and to the iron-
clad, unchangeable, ridiculous-
ly conservative curriculum
which is Davidson's,

Seldom if ever hes anyone
stooped to such an unso
phisticated level as to ex-
plain the underlying pur-
poses, the positive ideals, or

- the basic line of reasoning
behind ali the provinciel
‘“Thou shalts” and “Thou
shalt nots” with which our
lives at Davidson are blessed.

Seldom is there evidenced a
frame of mind which indicates
to the freshmen that precedent

PEANL IS

Is not the reason you lauded
Milton Gee and the current
Court of Control because the
uniform, stereotyped image of
what an acceptable freshman
ought to be and to do is now
well-ingrained in the sub-con-
scious element of almost every
freshman’s thought - process?
And is it not logical to call the
function of the Court of Con-
trol an all-too-serious form of
brainwashing?

The conformity achieved
by the efforts of the Court
is not praiseworthy for it
was implemented by external
force rather than by encour-
agement of voluntary con-
formity by individuals, and
forced acceptance of the gen-
eral will in directing private
affairs is undoubtedly the
most base variety of spine-

less acquiescence and loss of
individual dignity.

It is without doubt a serious
error to assume ,that any loyal-
ty to or feeling for the college
is a consequence of wide de-
mand for conformity to a su-
perficial, pep-rally type of emo-
tional spasm, _ confidently
labeled by some, school spirit.

Dear Editor:

It is indeed amazing that Da-
vidson students are getting ex-
cited about “The Status Seek-
ers"—something in the field of
thought, something which has
psychological and philosophical
implications.

However (Although |
haven't read THE STATUS
SEEKERS and don’t Intend
to, there being plenty of oth-
er books that i'd like to find
some spare time for) the at-

vidson except for the material-
istic inclinations of our pa-
rents, and the fact that we are
here testifies that we are not
ready to give up book-learning
for an approach to truth, how-
ever valid it may be, through
freedom from convention.

Most of us hope to graduate
and to enter a profitable pro-
fession, where we can be of
great help to that portion of
mankind we see in the mirror,
providing him al! the financial
advantages and endeavoring to
give him as high a “standard
of living’ as possible.

1 do not condemn the Beat
Generation or any other true
rebels or honest critics. | have
an idea that D. H. Lawrence,
Vance Packard, Ginsberg,
and others open themselves
to truths and insights which
the rest of us are too con
fortable and hardened to
look for.

But let us not be blind hy-
pocrites. If we are going to be
hypocrites, then let us contrive
to do so with a will and a pur-
pose.

But as long as we're exam-
ing faults that we have in our-
selves, let us admit that we
don’t love our fellowman very
much, that we want money
(and status), but let’s
honestly look into the itlea~ of
finding some relative values
which can be held at the same
time: finding pleasure in help-
ing those who are less fortunate
than ourselves, bejng a little
concerned about the world and

the tremendous economic and

philosophical questions that
have always confronted it, and
being sensitive to the sensation

of beauty in our common place

experiences.

Is Threat-Ridden &

yf

By PETER STERLING

The US. military policy has

developed around the concept
of total war based upon “mass-
ive retaliation” imposed upon
the enemy with the intent to
destroy his will to resist.

In other words, the US.

would employ its vast military
might to annihilate the enemy.
Yet, with the advent of Soviet.

thermonuclear weapons and
ballistic missiles such a policy
is self-defeating.

Any attempt af total war
by either the U.S. or USSR
would be suicidal, given the
present balance of military
power. A nuclear attack up-
on either society would
create a social, political and
economic catastrophe from
which the country could not
immediately, if ever, recov-
er. Therefore, the possession
of such awful power deters
either side from utilizing it.

Despite our reliance upon

such a policy, we have found
it untenable in smaller wars
which do not affect our nation-
al survival enough to initiate
global destruction. Consequent-

ly, the mutual possession of
nuclear weapons and the policy

of total destruction has not

mitigated limited wars.

In. areas such as_ Korea,
Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu,
Tibet, Hungary, Sikkim and
Laos the total-war policy was

not effective. In fact, it allowed

Russia to calculate that we
would not risk self destruction
in areas not in our absolute na-

tional interest.

Just as the policy of total
war has not prevented limited
war, the policy of total peace
has not produced limited peace.
In the disarmaments confer-
ences since 1945, both the U.S.
and U.S.S.R. have advocated
programs to bring total peace
to the world. It must be under-
stood, though, that the arms
race was created by basic dif-
ferences and fear among na-
tions.

te is very unlikely that
either side will diserm as
tong as it cannot trust the
other. Negotiation is difficult
because the use of force to
coercise the enemy is reduced
by the destructive potential
of tote! war.

Disarmament discussion s
have centered ‘around three
principles: the end of nuclear
weapons, inspection of military
installations, . and _ protection
against surprise attack. When
these concepts are studied con-
cretely it can be seen how dif-
ficult they are to attain.

For example, how does oe
nation prevent surprise at-
tacks when missiles can be
manufactured and teaunched
from secret places and ar-
rive in the U.S. in less than
half en hour?

The concept of total war has
not lessened the threat of limit-
ed war because absolute power
is unapplicable. Likewise, the
concept of total peace is unat-
tainable in a world of mutual
suspicion and massive military
might.

Not only should the military
supplement its total-war con-
cepts with limited-war tactics,
but also diplomacy ought ‘to
seek methods to secure limited
peace. In the military and di-
plomatic realm, “the quest for
certainty is the prescription
for inaction.”
