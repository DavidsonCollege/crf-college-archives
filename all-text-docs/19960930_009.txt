THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS —

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1996

So there I was. Just sitting in
Chambers with my friend and
studying a little political theory. It
was about midnight and I was get-
ting ready to call ita night. When
all of a sudden the scariest thing
happened. My friend asked me a
question: “Are you happy?” Pretty
innocent question, right? Ithought
about it for all of one second and
answered with an honest and un-
qualified “yes.” No problem, case
closed, I went back to my Marx.

But there was another ques-
tion: “Why?” And I thought for

another second, and I answered ©

with an unqualified “why not?”
No problem, case closed, I went
back to my Marx.

Only now I couldn’t concen-
trate, [kept thinking about the ques-
tions and my answefs. Was I really
happy? Why? Did I have a right to
be happy? We hear so much about
the problems with everything, the
world, the country, and even

Davidson itself. How many ar-
ticles do we read each week on
increasing security or some other
crisis on the court? And I thought,
and thought. I thought about it all
weekend, in fact. AndI came to the
same conclusion I came to the first
time. I am absolutely, extraordi-
narily, perfectly happy.

Think about it for one sec-
ond. That’s it, forget your books,
forget that thesis, forget looking
for jobs, homecoming dates, mean-
ing, salvation, think about it for a
second. Why shouldn’t we be
happy? I have never seen more
beautiful weather in my life than in
the state of North Carolina. The
season premier of ER was Thurs-
day. Fallis onits way. Your friends
are pretty cool. . .unless of course
you happen to be friends with me,
in which case I apologize. Your
parents aren’t here, but they are
always a phone call away (although
BTI can go to hell in my opinion).

I’ve noticed recently that
many people expect me to have
a plan for my life. I understand
that this is not an unreasonable
assumption, considering that in
a few short months my happy
life here at Davidson will be
over, and I will be thrown merci-
lessly to the clutches of the 9-5
cubicle existence of post-gradu-
ate employment. Yes, the dark
cloud of Davidson afterlife once
hanging in the distance (far away
distance) now looms tauntingly

Davidson). Many stare for a few
seconds, collect their shock with
a few comforting words thrown
in my direction and hurry away,
making excuses about pressing
engagements or needy kitchen
floors that haven’t been mopped
in months. ;

~ Others, (usually type B left-
brainers), like to laugh it off, as if
I am just being difficult or coy:
“Oh (ha-ha) that’s not true, surely
you have an idea!” My mother’s
friends like this one. Their kitchen
floors are usually crying for at-
tention as well, soon after my

agree that the question, coming
from anyone other than our-
selves, is hitting below the belt
and should be avoided atall costs.
Since this is a virtual impossibil-
ity, I’ve started taking note of
the varied reactions that ensue
from the ambiguity of my an-
swer, “I have no idea.”

Most people seeking my re-
sponse will pop the question with
an excited, intrigued look on their
face, like the answer to follow
surely will blow them off their
feet.

Reactions vary from person
to person when they compre-
hend my own cluelessness.
Sometimes it’s the stare of dis-
belief (people don’talways know
how to react to ambiguity or
non-direction, especially at

the question negative re-
to myself, SRORSE,
“What ARE = feel certain that many of 4

one else’s life: “Oh, that’s great!
I know exactly what you should
do. Now [have a friend. . .” These
people are either nosy busy-bod-
ies or future career services em-
ployees.

My reaction of choice as of
late is the mellow drifter response,
usually belonging to drifters them-
selves, those being people who
are currently drifting (age nonde-

ing stint but wish they could have
drifted a little longer: “Cool man,
just chill out for a few years, don’t
rush into anything.” My thoughts
exactly.

As my classmates and I
struggle through our last year at
Davidson, constantly plagued,
with the pressure of a plan, my
advice remains, just don’t ask.

There are parties, concerts, plays,
movies, the Post Office, and a Ben
and Jerry’s all within ten minutes
of any place on campus. We are
generally nice people. And somuch
more. SoI settled the first question
rather easily.

The second question was
rather more difficult to answer.
Why was I so happy? Why could
Itake pleasure in such simple things
when I had two tests, and a paper,
and a movie I had to watch, and a
journal, and a lab, and a room to
clean, and a bummed-out friend,
and a meeting with my advisor,
and no homecoming date, and I
still hadn’t finished Marx? What
about the world, the ecology, the
whales, the trees, the future, my
future, toxic waste, Iraq, the up-
coming elections? Why was I at
peace with myself when all of these
things needed someone who was
not content? And I realized that I
was not content: Iwas mad. There

are some things that just need to be
addressed and I’m gonna doitright
now:

First:: Who told Demi Moore
that she could act? She couldn’t
act her way out of a wet paper bag
with a sharp knife and a map.

Second: Why does the Crew
team have to practice at five in the
morning. No really, I love hearing
my roommate’s alarm before the
sun comes up. [have always won-
dered about this because every crew
team in the world does this. And it
causes me grief.

Third: How come the low fat
Doritos in the Union have more fat
than the regular Doritos? I don’t
even like Doritos, but I feel that
this is indeed an issue that needs
to be addressed.

Fourth: How dare our profes-
sors actually give us work and ex-
pect us to turn it in on time?
Uncaring monsters, don’t they
know that college is about life, not

academics?

Fifth: Why are there so many
commercials on the radio? Can
we do something about this?

Sixth: How come they took
email out of the library? Seems to
me that if they wanted people to go |
there, they should install MORE
email terminals. .

So I have vented. I feel better
now. I suppose that I really didn’t
have much of a point, but then,
why is having a point so impor-
tant? I had a lot of fun writing this,
sol really didn’t have anything to
lose. I’m still happy, and maybe
for one brief moment, I made you
happy, too.

Unless you are Demi Moore,
in which case I don’t really care
whether or not you are happy be-
cause you made 12 million dollars
for three months work, and I found
five dollars in my pocket and took
my friends to Taco Bell to cel-
ebrate.

Fact v. Fiction

In the last issue of the The
Davidsonian there appeared an ar-
ticle entitled: “Yes, I am an angry
feminist,” which, to say the least,
outraged us. The author was deeply
concerned with the oppression of
women in Pakistan and gave nu-
merous stories to “support” her
view (without relating any
sources).She told a dubious ac-
count about how a grandmother
was raped by 50 Muslim police-
men and then taken to a local po-
lice station. The author obviously
did not know that'in Pakistan a
woman can only be arrested and
taken to jail by a women police
officer. Fact v. Fiction. In addi-
tion, the author offers the “two
finger test” for testing the “purity”
of a woman. Interesting. Eighteen
years of living in Pakistan, and
neither of us have never heard of
such a test. Fact v. Fiction.

The majority of people living
within Pakistan are Muslim; most
laws are based on Islamic dogma.
The author mentioned zina, which
is an example of such a law which
prohibits sex outside marriage.
However, the police do not go
knocking on doors and peeping
inside bedrooms, checking mar-
riage certificates. Forevery woman
sent to jail for zina, there is a man
who goes along with her for being
a counterpart in the deed. The au-
thor claimed that “75% of all
women in Pakistan’s jails are there
because they were rape victims.
Once in custody, 72% of them are
raped again by members of the
police force.” Wow! Where, may
we ask, did she get these figures?
Women have separate jails where
only women are allowed to come
and go. A major part of the staff is
female, thereby raising the ques-
tion, how could heterosexual rapes
take place? Would one woman
stand by and watch another woman
get raped?

A woman is given more re-

spect in Pakistan than anywhere in
the Western “civilized” world,
where they are considered “equal.”
Public transport has seats reserved
in the front for women. If there are
more women aboard a bus than
space permits, men are asked to
give up their seats. In fact, having
travelled extensively around Paki-
stan we can recall several inci-
dents of having to step off the bus
altogether because there was not
enough space for the women. Fact
vs. Fiction.

Rape in Pakistan is to be
proved like any other criminal of-
fence in which circumstantial evi-
dence like medical or any other is
vital. Such cases do not require
examination or production of four
witnesses. Evidence of even one
witness of the prosecution is
enough. On the other hand, law for
fornication and adultery enforced
in Pakistan is based on Quranic
injunction (Al Quran 24:4) “And
those who launch a charge against
chaste women, and produce not
four witnesses (to support their
allegation) flog them with 80
stripes; and reject their evidence
ever after, forsuch men are wicked
transgressors.”

The point to note is that where

as to convict a mani of committing”

rape medical evidence or circum-
stantial evidence, or evidence of
even one witness is sufficient, but
if some woman is accused of adul-
tery, it has to be proved by four
witnesses, which is twice the nor-
mal requirement (even for murder
cases and business transactions).

This is how Islam offers protection "

to the women; it appears the lady
who wrote the article was con-

fused in her thinking or may have .

lacked sufficient knowledge. Fact
vs. Fiction.

Oppression is a major prob-
lem facing women around the
world. In France, Muslim women
cannot even wear a scarf (hijab) to

cover their heads in public schools.
The majority of French people,
especially teachers, are vehemently
against the wearing of the scarf in
school. Muslim women in France,
(a country supposedly found on
the democratic principles of equal-
ity and freedom over two hundred
years ago when a horific revolu-
tion in France shook Europe), can’t
even wear a piece of cotton fabric
around their head; it is simply not
allowed. Francois Bayrou, a
French Minister, stated the scarf.
acted as an “ostentatious religious
symbol.” With France being a
“modern” country, how can it tol-
erate the persecution of women?
In Pakistan, no Christian or Jewish
students are kicked out of school
for wearing their respectable “reli-
gious garb.” Fact vs. Fiction.

The degree to which women
are exploited in the West is stupen-
dously greater than Pakistan and
many other Islamic countries.
There are no half naked women on
billboards in downtown Islamabad
advertising Nissan.

Pakistan, Bangladesh, and
Turkey all have (or have had)
women as their heads of state. How
many women presidents. have we
had in the United States? Fact vs.
Fiction.

Before people jump to con-
clusions and start making up nice
little fabricated stories about the
oppression of women in “far off”
countries, they should open their
eyes and look where they live. The
author’s right to be a feminist is
respected; however, plastering a
country of which she has at best
limited knowledge with outrageous
bastardizations and fabricated lies
is not the way to make your voice
heard. Fact vs. Fiction.

We wonder how many times
she has ever actually been to Paki-
stan. Supporting your argument is
good. Fictional writing should be
left to Salman Rushdie.
