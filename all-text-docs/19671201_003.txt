‘Hasn’t Been Exactly Easy’

By BOB REID
Managing Editor

Being a Negro at Davidson
is a_ difficult role which
makes the black student
keenly aware of his biack-
‘ness.

This was the opinion ex-
pressed by three of David-
sons’ five black students, as
they gathered in a dormitory
room labelied ‘“‘The Sout
Room" and talked about their
problems over the music of
Claudine and The Four Tops.

“It hasn't been exactly
easy,’ said senior Leslie
Brown, who with classmate
Wayne Crumwell became the
first American Negro stu-
dents to enroll at Davidson.
“You realize just how differ.
ent you are.”

Crumwell and sophomore
Calvin Murphy agreed.
“Since you are different from
most of the students,” Crum-
well said, ‘it is hard to iden-
tify with large sections of
Davidson student life.”

The difference is deeper
than skin color, they said.
Soon the black Davidson stu-
dent realizes that he has dif-
ferent tastes in music, food,
entertainment and thought
patterns from his fellow stu-
dents.

So to bridge these differ-
ences the black student tries
to become a white man in
his way-of-life. But. they
said, he soon finds this is im-
possible, and as a defense
mechanism, he falls back on
his blackness.

“When I came here.” Mur-
phy said, “I wanted to be
identified as a Davidson Col-
lege student. Now I want to
be identified as a black
Davidson College student.”

“You can't integrate tully,”
Crumwell said, ‘“‘here or any-
where else. What good is in-
tegrating if the feeling behind
it is not real.”

Once the Negro student has
developed this sense of uniq-
ueness. his tendency is to
want to “strike out’ against
the white world, they added.
This feeling displays itself,

_ienced freedom

they said, in various forms.
ranging from passive distaste
to more radical approaches.

“Brown and Crumwell said
they felt this realization de-
veloping during their sopho-
more year and junior years.
Brown said the determinating
factor in his realization was
a PRAM trip to South Ameri-
ca, where he said he exper.
“like I’ve
never felt it before.”

One of the major problems
of the Davidson Negro is so-
cial life. Few- of the white
girls’ schools in the area have
more than one or two Neg-
roes in their student bodies,
and as a result black fresh-
men seldom have dates at
mixers. Since all the black
students are on scholarships,
none of them have cars to
drive to predominately Negro
schools in the area.

But the problem of social
contact is more complex than
this. Because of the differ-
ence in attitudes and back-
ground, Negroes and whites
here have little common
ground for friendships and
meaningful social relations,
the black students said.

“Both races have their
hangups."" Crumwell said.
“The Negroes are suspicious
of white peoples’ motives and
the whites have this sense of
superiority that is part of
their heritage. Therefore,
it's almost impossible to de-
velop real friendships (be-
tween whites and blacks).”

All agreed that life was
gradually becoming easier
for Davidson's Negro stu-
dents, and that the college
and student body has tried
to create a more natural en-
vironment for Negroes. Two
Negroes have pledged social
fraternities and black stu-
dents are members of several
student committees and or-
ganizations. But the black
students feel there. is room
for improvement.

“You'll never get a Negro
to come here and enjoy it”
Brown said, “‘unless you have
a larger Negro student body.
Sometimes we like to get
‘away from white students

and be with our brothers."

Brown suggested that in or-
der to enroll more Negroes,
Davidson adopt Yale Univer-
sity’s system of recruiting.
Yale tutors Negro students on
campus for a year before en-
rolling them as freshmen.
This, Brown said, is neces-
sary because of the poor
quality of Negro secondary
schools.

Both Brown and Crumwell
hesitated in saying whether
or not they would return to
Davidson. Brown said he
would not, while Crumwell,
though not enthusiastic, said
he would unless he received
a better offer. ‘I’m basically
materialistic," he quipped.

Davidson is interested in
attracting good students, re-
gardiess of race, according
to Director of Admissions H.

All said they had gained a
realization of thelr blackness

here that they would not have.

gained otherwise. *‘Black stu-
dents think Negroes 1n white
schools are ‘Uncle Toms.”
Brown said. But they're
wrong. It's more ‘the re
verse."

Where wil! this realization
lead? “It is generally lead
ing me to dedicate myself
to working with black people.
and help them realize that
there is a pride in being
black,’ said Brown.

What has come out of this
experience? “‘A general re-
vulsion for the so-called
‘American way of life,’
he added.

No Bias In Admissions

At Davidson, Says White

more Negroes each year
than the number who even.
tually enroll. This trend has
been consistent since the
first years of Davidson's
integration.

The decision to desegregate
Davidson came in the aca
demic year 1961-62 when the

trustees decided to admit a.

Congolese student for the fall
of 1962. The first American
Negroes enrolled two years
later.

Since 1964, the number of
Negro applications has rang-
ed from four to 12, but usual-
ly runs between four and
seven, according to White.

White said that he could
not remember how many
Negroes applied to enter Da-
vidson with the class of 1971,
but he pointed out that only
one of the three Negroes who
were accepted actually en-
roiled.

In each of the previous
three years, two students had
enrolled, White said. But
he asserted, ‘‘There cer-
tainly is no quuta— either a
maximum or a minimum.”

White said some attempt

is made to recruit qualified
Negro students. The admis-
sions office tries to coordin-
ate staff visits to predomin-
antly Negro high schools with
the recruiting efforts of Da
vidson students and alumni.

Another factor which leads
to the small number of Ne-
gro applicants is the fact
that virtually no applications
are received from Negroes
outside of the North Carolina
area. Almost all Negro appli-
cations have been from South
Carolina, . North Carolina
and Virginia.

White said that the federal
government is encouraging
institutions of higher educa-
tion to recruit qualified ap-
plicants from disadvantaged
backgrounds through its Edu-
cational Opportunity Grant
Program.

This, he said, affects the
situation of the Negro to
some extent, but he empha-
sized that it is college policy
to provide financial aid equal
to need for any student—re-
gardiess of race. ‘‘We guar-
antee this, and intend to fol-
low through on it.”’ he said.

Recruiters Must

Try For Negroes

ED NOTE: This is con-
densed from an article in
“The Chronicle of Higher
Education.”

Admissidns directors who
claim they cannot enroll
qualified Negro candidates

simply have not been trying. ,

according to the admissions
director of a Northeastern
University.

‘People who say ‘Gee, we
just can't seem to find quali.
fied candidates’ just haven't
been out looking,’ said John
C. Hoy, dean of admissions
at Weslyan University in
Middletown, Conn.

In an article in the Nov. 8
issue of “The Chronicle of
Higher Education."’ Hoy said
Weslyan raised the: number
of Negroes in its freshman
class from two in 1964 to 39
in 1967.

Weslyan provides stipends
of between $2,500 and $3,000
for most Negro students, or
nearly all of their fees for
the year. The university al-
so provides remedial tutoring
in English, writing and for-
eign languages for Negro
students who need it, he said.

Hoy said he often picks up
students during tours for the
National Achievement Schol-
arship Program and visits
with Upward Bound classes,
which are government spon-
sored classes for promising
but indigent students. He of-
ten dips into the deepest
parts of the South—Alabama,
Georgia and Mississippi—for
applicants.

A list of successful Negro
graduates of Weslyan shows
a heavy concentration in
fields of law and education.

Hoy said he feels the uni-
versity benefits from the
presence of minority  stu-
dents. Several of them ac-
company recruiters on visits
to high schools. “The discus-
sion with high schoo! students
always goes better when
they’re along,” he said.
“They answer questions of
the student.”

He added that Negro stu-

dents make the university a
more interesting place. ‘You
don't know what you have on
your hands until you = get
nearly 10 per cent of your
students coming from this
group. Their ability to con-
tribute begins to come
through. Until then they're
too much of a minority to
show what they're made of.”’

“When you have only a
handful of Negro students,
they're usually either quiet
and conforming. or they're
taking a very extreme posi-
tion. The white students who

“know them assume theirs is

the position of all Negroes,"
he said.

“With more than 100 mi-
nority group kids on this
campus now, we have a real
richness of political attitude.
It ranges from the very mili-
tant, black nationalist, Af-
rica oriented guy and the
black nationalist America-
oriented guy to the extreme
of some guys who say ‘What's
the problem? I'm here to get
an education."

“You get kids organizing
black study groups and Afro-
American societies and soul
sessions. There are enough
guys to support a diversity
of options to the Negro prob-
lem.”

Hoy said he believes it is
so important to recrult Negro
students that he is wifling to
accept academic risks in ord-
er to get them. “We look for
interesting kids that may

have had some academic
dlficulty.

He added he does not be-
lieve institutions with pro-
grams like his deserve spec-
ial acclaim. The investment
made by universities in mi-
nority students will be repaid
many times, he said.

“Over 20 years these alum-
ni will far outweigh their
numbers in contributions to
society and as a reflection on
their institution.”
