Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,

On September 22, 1982, Dr. Sandor
Kiss, Foreign Service Officer for the
Hungarian Service on the Voice of
America, died as a result of an automo-
bile accident. As many of you know,
Dr. Kiss was the father of Elizabeth
Kiss ‘83.

Davidson was fortunate enough to
meet Dr. Kiss during his visit here in the
Spring of 1981 when he spoke on
“Communism and Fascism: Then and
Now -The Sory of the Hungarian Revo-
lution and Other Attempts at Freedom.”
From this talk and subsequent conversa-
tions, we learned why he has been
called one of the “spiritual and inspira-
tional” leaders of the attempted Hungar-
ian Revolution in 1956: having lived un-
der the regimes of both Hitler and Stal-
in, Dr. Kiss was imprisoned and sent-
enced to death for his political views
and activities. He also served as a key
witness at the U.N., as editor of East
Europe Magazine, and as_ member of
the Assembly of Captive “Nations. In
these and other endeavors, Dr. Kiss
lived his passion for freedom for all na-
tions and individuals and carried a torch
with which he continually sparked the
fight for Human Rights.

Because of his background and expe-
rience, Dr. Kiss brought to us a political
perspective that is a rare opportunity at
Davidson. It is our desire to preserve
this perspective and to pass it on to other
Davidson students; that is why we have
started the Sandor Kiss Memorial Fund.
Money collected through this fund will
be used to purchase books on issues re-
lated to Dr. Kiss’ life and work. If funds
provide, an effort will be made to bring
a speaker to campus from Voice of
America or some other group with
which Dr. Kiss was associated.

It is our feeling that Dr. Kiss’ life
work was and is worthwhile. This
Memorial Fund is an expression of our
desire to see his fight for Human Rights
continued on the Davidson campus, and
we are requesting your help.

Anyone wishing to contribute to the
Sandor Kiss Memorial Fund should take
their contributions to the Dean of Stu-
dents Office. Checks may be made pay-
able to Davidson College.

Thank you,
Catherine McMillan ‘83
Tracy Thompson ‘83

To the Editor:

Call me Roy.

I graduated with the class of 1975 at
the tender age of one. Not that I am par-
ticularly gifted—I’m not. Actually I’m
a dog whose owner (my father) was a
graduate of that very class. For various
reasons that owner now seeks anonymi-

Although I also followed my father
through law school, marriage and the
birth of two children, I have never been
able to recapture the bliss I experienced
during my tenure at Davidson. I ran
with a pack of alumni who carried the
tradename “Gozinya” much the same
way as a drunken sailor wears an obs-
cene tattoo.

I am not handsome. I am, in fact,
often mistaken for an animated gar-
goyle. But, as the saying goes, you will
never see as much character squeezed
into 25 pounds again. I have enclosed a
photo but would advise you to view it
only on an empty stomach.

I like all forms of athletics, have
been known to drink beer and I even at-
tended several of Malcolm Partin’s lec-
tures (you know, they say he talks to
cows).

But now my problem.

I do not “fit” with my present fami-
ly—a part of a suburban unit I am not.
The talk of mutiny fills the air, my al-
lowance was recently trimmed and my
beer quota has been rationed. I expect
my pink slip any day now, with all of its
murderous entailments.

I am writing in a very sincere effort
to locate a foster father (or mother for
that matter) who is presently attending
Davidson. Even my father reluctantly
agrees that this is the only alternative
available. I understand that I would be
delivered free of charge with bowl, food
and the latest in canine vaccinations. I
also carry a rebate worth one case of ber
(my choice).

Please print my plea in a future edi-
tion and send me a bill (I’m fiscally re-
sponsible) and a copy of the edition (I’m
also egocentric). All inquiries should be
sent to the address listed below. Hell,
Pll even pay for the phone call.

Sincerely,

Roy McCioy

To the Editor:

With half the term almost gone most
of us have had our first tests and papers
put behind us. In getting into the routine
of studying many of you have had the
chance to “wander” up to the 900 Room
on a weeknight or enjoy the entertain-
ment there on the weekends. This letter
is In response to several questions that
have arisen concerning the 900 Room
that would help clarify the Room’s si-
tuation.

The 900 Room is a dual concern be-
tween the College Union and the Dining
Service. In many ways the 900 Room is
no different from any other room in the
Union. It is primarily a programming
room for the Union. On the weeknights
the Room’s program usually is the
Room itself in the latter part of the even-
ing: people relaxing, listening to music,
drinking a beer or a coke perhaps and
taking a soetimes long-needed break.
On the weekend the program of the
Room is usually some sort of planned
entertainment. The Intimate Performan-
ces Committee of the Union Board usu-
ally is responsible for the booking of
this entertainment. This group works
hard to bring Davidson College diverse
yet very good and entertaining acts and
events. On the weekends the primary
focus of the Room is the program and
not the alcohol. Please keep this in
mind.

The Dining Service’s primary con-
cern is in providing the liquid and food
services for the Room. There is some in-
terest in expanding this area although
our means are limited. Starting this
week there will be a survey in the 900
Room that we will use to get a feeling
for what you would like to see. We will
discuss seriously any ideas you will be
good enough to give us, and we need
your thoughts.

For you to be able to enjoy the Room
and for us to be able to help you any way
we can here are several rules that we feel

Ipressed in many other Jetters printed .

necessary to point out:

1. Don’t forget your I.D.! If you have
a guest he or she must also have an I.D.
of some sort (driver’s license, college
I.D.’ etc). Your guest must be signed in
clearly and made aware of the rules of
the Room. Please remember that you
are responsible for your guest.

2. Donotbring in or take out any alco-
holic beverages of any kind.

3. Do not come behind the bar.

4. Do not use the stairwell between
the Café and the 900 Room.

5. Checks can be written only for the
exact amount of purchase.

6. Bartenders have the right to refuse
service if it should become necessary.

Please remember that the 900 Room
is a privilege and not a right. Treat it as
such.
