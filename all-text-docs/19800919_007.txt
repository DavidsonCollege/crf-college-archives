Segovia protege to perform

By ROBERT THATCHER

“That’s quite enough,”’ said
the Maestro to his young Amer-
ican student, “if you continue

‘tike this you will be one of the
greats.””

Such was the reaction of the
legendary classical guitarist
Andres Segovia after a recital
by one of his most dedicated.
students, Michael Lorimer. Se-
venteen years later, Segovia’s
conditional praise of this young
man has become a reality.

Now one of the world’s fore-
most classical and baroque gui-
tarists, Lorimer will open Da-
vidson’s 1980-81 Artist Series.

Lorimer came into promi-
nence in the early 1970’s after
completing his studies under
Segovia and was soon recog-
nized as an ‘“‘aristocrat of. his
instrument.’’ Since then, he has
maintained a busy schedule of
giving concerts and instructing
some aspiring young guitarists
in the Segovian tradition.

Lorimer has enjoyed a con-
sistantly growing audience
which includes a tremendous
following outside the United
States. He was the first Amer-
ican guitarist to be invited to
perform in the Soviet Union
where he toured the major cities

in 1975, and then was immedi- .

ately reinvited for a 1977 tour.
Also, Lorimer returned very
recently from a successful tour
of Israel, — -

Many people find Lorimer’s
performances refreshing in con-
trast to many other classical
guitarists in part because he
often gives his audience brief
personable introductions to the
music. Another reason so many

people are interested in Michael —

Lorimer lies in the fact that
apart from his matchless pro-
ficiency on the classical guitar,
he is considered the primary
exponent of the baroque guitar
as well.

Lorimer performs all his ba-

roque pieces on an instrument
duplicated for him from an
original severiteenth century in-
strument. He said, ‘‘it gives the
audience some idea of what the
guitar looked like before it was
the guitar.”’

Lorimer is presently spending
this academic year at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at
Wilmington as a .visiting en-

Don Carlton—the man who really draws Doonesbury

(CPS) Few people have ever
heard of the man who draws
what may be the most talked-
about comic strip in America.

Don.Carlton—not Pulitzer
Prize winner Garry Trudeau—
draws the famous Doonesbury
strip, which appears daily in
more than 400 newspapers na-
tionwide.

In fact, Trudeau hasn’t done
the strip entirely himself since
beginning work on his master’s
degree at Yale in 1971.

‘*Most people don’t know
anybody.eise works on it but
Garry Trudeau,” Carlton says.
“You tell people you're a car-

toonist and that you do Doones-
bury and they say, ‘Oh no,
you're crazy. That’s Garry Tru-
deau.’ ”’

“TI don’t get much attention.”’

The ideas are entirely Tru-
deau’s. But he does only the
preliminary drawings and the
dialogue in his New York stu-
dio. Then he sends the sketches
to Carlton in suburban Kansas
City via express mail.

Carlton, 43, is responsible for
putting,the strips in publishable
form.

Trudeau’s drawing talent has
long been suspect. When the

strip first appeared in the Yale

Daily News in 1968, the draw-
ings were primitive.

His Doonesbury sketches still
rarely show detail, except when
a new character or feature is
introduced. Otherwise, Trudeau
simply scribbles in stock fea-
tures, such as the White House.

‘Sometimes,’ Carlton says,
‘“*he doesn’t even bother to
pencil in the faces.”

However, Carlton receives
little credit. His name doesn’t
appear on the. strip, and his
salary is a fraction of what the
author pulls in. Trudeau is
believed to be a millionaire.

While his boss mingles with
Manhattan's elite— Trudeau
has dated Candice Bergen and
is currently seeing Jane Pau-
ley—Carlton has trouble con-
vincing strangers what he does
for a living.

“I’m big on the junior high
speaking circuit,’’ he jokes. ‘‘I
don't impress my kids much,
and most of my friends don’t
zven read Doonesbury.”

In the trade, Carlton is
b.wown as an “inker.’’ someone
who goes over the pencil sketch-
es of another artist in ink. He is
only mentioned once in a 1976
‘ime magazine cover story on
Doonesbury and Trudeau used
that description.

‘That description ticks me
alt, ne said) “Ils portrayed
like some guy who sits in some
dark corner at the syndicate
who Trudeau hands the strip to
on the last step before the
engraver.” -

Actually, Carlton provides
much of the detail. Often he
even has to sign Trudeau's
name if the author forgets.

Each cartoon, he recalls,
takes about 90 minutes to
complete. The longer Sunday

version, which includes color,
takes between three and four
hours. In the process, Carlton is
only occasionally tempted to
put a little of himself in the
strips. ‘Occasionally, I've in-
serted a friend’s name on the
mailbox of the White House,
but not very often. I’m a
finishing artist."’

He became one through a
circuitous route. Carlton, who
has:a degree in commercial art
from Texas Christian Universi-
ty, was working as circulation
manager for three Kansas City-
based trade magazines when he
was first approached about
hooking up with Trudeau.

A friend of his wha owns
Universal Press Syndicate,
which publishes Doonesbury,
asked him whether he’d be
interested in helping out.

“I told Jim (Andrews) thanks
but no thanks,’’ he remembers.
“{ just didn’t think it would
work out financially. I never
thought the strip would make
it. It was crudely drawn, crude-
ly lettered, and I didn’t think
the subject matter was that
good.”

‘Plus I had an image of
Garry. He was a Yalie. He was
a blueblood—his great grand-
father's in the history books.
And'T figured he was awfully
brash, not exactly the kind of
guy a mid-American family
man like me would want as an
associate."
