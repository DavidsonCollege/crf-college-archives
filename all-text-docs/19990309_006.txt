Riding a late-season surge, the
Lady Wildcats entered the quarterfinal
round of the Southern Conference Tour-
nament last Friday afternoon at Greens-
boro.

The brackets pitted the fourth
seeded Wildcats against fifth ranked

Furman Uni-

Furman in both of their-regular season
conference match-ups this season for
the first time ever. In Friday’s
quarterfinal match, Davidson was faced
with the challenge of making it three
straight against Furman and their star
forward Jackie Smith, selected the
Southern Conference’s Most Valuable
Player for the season and a contender
for All-American honors.

Showing unprecedented levels of
intensity and euphoria, the Wildcats
pounced out to a 36-18 halftime lead
against Furman. The run was fueled by
a fast-paced transition game under the
command of junior point guard Jen
O’Brien. Kerry and Jamie Brown fin-
ished break after break with a string of
picturesque jumpers.

“It helps when we're hitting shots
like that. Kerry doesn’t miss from the
baseline. And Jamie doesn’t miss ei-
ther,” said O’Brien. “I'd be spinning
my head out there if I weren’t on their
team.”

Instead, it was the head of Furman
Coach Sherry Carter that was spinning.
“T don’t think we played very well. We
were very tentative. We were afraid to
shoot, afraid to drive.”

Davidson’s bench, particularly
sophomore posts Kim Taylor and Jes-
sica Heath, came through strong in the
first half. “Their bench is very tall,
they’re big rebounders,” conceded
Coach Carter. “They can come in and
play a role. That’s what you want a
bench to do, they do a good job of that.”

“T think you saw one of the better
halves in the first half that we’ ve played
all season,” said Wildcat coach John
Filar. “We got fantastic shots and great
looks at the basket.”

Midway through the second half,
Furman benched starting point guard
Tara Charles and went to freshman guard
Althea Bufford. Bufford sparked a
Furman comeback that brought the game
within a point with under a minute to
play.

“You have to credit Furman with

picking their defense up in the second
half,” said Filar.

“We probably should have made
the (point guard) change earlier,” ad-
mitted Carter. “She did a great job of
getting out on the break and running.
Her presence, her defense and quick-
ness, helped us to play a different style.
Our guards weren’t getting it done, and
Althea came in and was a great spark.
That was the difference in the last ten
minutes of the game.”

But the ultimate difference was

Montrella-less ’Cats fall to ASU in finals

‘Tis better to have loved and lost...

The Lady Wildcats flirted with a
championship title in the Southern Con-
ference Tournament, reaching the final
game before falling 78-69 to Appala-
chian State University last Sunday.

Davidson, playing without the ser-

vices of se-

Davidson 69] nior Jess
App. State 78 Montrella
- who in-

jured her knee in the previous night’s
semi-final game, just couldn’t spark an
offensive attack against Appalachian
State’s impenetrable zone defense.

“We felt that as long as they stayed
in their man-to-man defense that we'd
have the quickness fo take them off the
dribble, but when they went to the zone
we got real cold,” said head coach John
Filar. “We just never really found a
rhythm again, we never got intoasmooth
ball movement.“

Davidson could not pull the Moun-
taineers out of their zone, as Wildcat
shooters were ice-cold around the pe-
rimeter, shooting 11% (2 of 18) from
the 3-point line until the game’s final
two minutes.

The absence of Montrella in the
middle was felt not only on both ends of
the court, but also in the lack of her
rebounding ability that so often sparked
Davidson’s transition offense.

“(Davidson has) a very good run-
ning game. We’ re not quick enough to
stop their running game, but if some-
body can do that, it will give them some
problems,” predicted Furman coach
Sherry Carter after her Lady Paladins
lost to the ‘Cats in the tournament
quarterfinals.

Sure enough, Appalachian State
was able to stall Davidson’s trademark
running game. “We just had a really
tough time getting the transition game
going, and that’s a big part of our of-
fense,” admitted coach Filar.

Appalachian’s Beth Schoolfield
scored 24 points on her way to earning
Tournament Most Outstanding Player
honors.

“We ran into a team that is playing
extremely well, offensively and defen-
sively,” confessed Filar. “They have
always given.us trouble with their de-
fense. We were alittle depleted to begin
with, and our foul trouble made that
worse.”

After scoring 92 points the previ-
ous night, Davidson’s offense (the best
in the conference) was held to only 69.

“It was really hard,” said Jess
Montrella, who watched the game on
crutches from the sideline. “As soon as
I was injured in the game yesterday I

knew that it was pretty bad and that I
wasn’t going to play... (But) I knew that
we could win with or without me...I felt
good that I had been a part that we had
made it here and I was happy about
that.”

From the start of conference play,
it was readily apparent that any number
of teams could take home the banner.
Furman’s coach Sherry Carter, specu-
lated, “Anybody could win it. They
might as well have the commissioner
come in, throw the top six teams into
the hat, and just pick one out.”

Davidson’s coach pondered a prag-
matic explanation on that very same
thought: “We got hot for two days,”
said Filar, “and Appalachian got hot for
three.”

made by Davidson’s point guard, Jen
O’Brien. The. conference’s leader in
assists and steals secured the victory »
with a pair of clutch free throws with
just seconds left in the game. Those two
free throws earned O’Brien her 999"
and 1000" career points.

“At the end of the game when Jen
O’Brien stepped up to the free throw
line, all I could think is that this is
exactly who we want there right now,”
commended Jamie Brown. “Jen is so
much of a leader. Off the court she’s a
leader, and on the court she keeps our
team under control. I’m very proud for
Jen that she’s been able to accomplish
this. She’s deserved it and she’s worked
very hard.”

After being swept this season by
Davidson, Furman coach Carter won-
dered if her team could have conceiv-
ably matched up against the ‘Cats. “I
think that’s irrelevant now. I don’t care
to beat them in intramurals. That’s not
really something I think about at this
point, if we could beat them now. Be-
cause our season’s over.”

Davidson’s season was far from
over, having earned the chance to match
up against UNC-Greensboro in the
tournament’s semi-final contest. “We
would have loved to have kept that 25-
point lead, rather than having the game
go down to the wire,” said Filar. “We
know now that'we’ re tournament-tested.
We know we had a tough game and we
pulled it out when we had to. This game,
down the road, is going to help us much
more so tomorrow.”

The ensuing 30 hours would turn John
Filar’s words into epic prophecy.
