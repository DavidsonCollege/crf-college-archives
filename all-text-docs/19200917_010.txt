Senior Division of the R. O. T. C.
at Davidson College. The division
is divided into two courses, viz:
Basic Course, which comprises the
' first two years in college, Freshmen
and Sophomore years, with a period
at a summer camp, usually between
the first and second years, which is
not compulsory; and the Advanced
all first and second year men, the
Advanced Course elective for those
recommended for the further train-
ing by the Professor of Military
Science and Tactics, concurred in by
the President of the college. By a
recent ruling of the War Depart-
ment, the Plattsburg Camp of 1918
will count as the summer camp for
the Advanced Course. There are
several men among the Seniors this
year who will derive the benefits
of the Commutation of rations
which is paid to all men who sign
the contract at the beginning of
their third year in R. O. T. C. Upon
signing the contract the U. S. Gov-
ernment will pay all students money
commutation of rations at a rate
fixed from time to time by the
President of the U. S., which is 53

cents per day at present. This is
payable for the entire period from
the date of signing of the contract
less the time actually furnished
rations in kind while in camp. In
the Advanced Camp, students are
paid at the rate of $1.00 per day. In
addition to free medical attendance,
board, lodging, uniform clothing,
they are paid mileage to and from
camp at the rate of 5 cents per mile
and allowed $3.00 per day for com-
mutation of subsistance while en-
route to and from camp. Upon the
completion of the Advanced Course,
the student is given a commission in
the Officers Reserve Corps. Reserve
officers are subject to promotion
just as are officers on the active list.
In time of peace, no reserve officer
can be called to active duty for
more than 15 days in a_ calendar
year without his consent. In time
of war a reserve officer is subject to
call to active duty, with his consent.
It is much better to enter the army
in time of emergency as a second
lieutenant than as a private. With
the consent of the reserve officer he
may be placed on the active list as
a temporary second lieutenant for
six months training with some reg-
ular army outfit, with pay at the

JUNIORS AND SENIORS, LOOK!

but will be furnished the ration in
kind.

While in camp you also receive
pay at the rate of a dollar a day.
You are paid five cents per mile to
and from camp for transportation,
and have .a liberal allowance for
meals en route. Everything at camp
is free, and of the best. You have
ample opportunity to kill a big time
—dances at the post, passes to town
every night, if‘you want them, and
numerous other things. The work
doesn’t kill you, by a long shot. Ask
the men who have been there.

The training in the Advanced
Course is superior to that of the
Basic, taking in the fine points and
also the broader aspects of the
game. You are certain of the chance
to serve as an officer or non-com.,
performing as many of the duties of
a regular army officer or non-com.
as can be arranged for. Space
doesn’t permit of going into a de-
tailed account of the advantages, so
think it out for yourself. Remem-
ber it is your duty to do a little
something for ‘these United States,”
if you haven't already done it. And
to-join the Advanced Course is just
what the Government wants you to

lo.

After you complete your Advanc-
ed Course you may have a commis-
sion in the Officers Reserve Corps,
if you have earned it; and, of course,
every man who can get a reserve
commission should do so, and as
quickly as possible. Your commis-
sion is for five years, and you may
be promoted in that time.

But it will soon be too late; so
think now, and then act. Remem-
ber, the Government rates Davidson
largely on the number of men in the
Advanced Course. Are you going
to help raise the standard?

There is a lot of dope at head-
quarters ; if you are interested, dro
over and see it. Or have a talk wit
some of the Advanced Course men.
They can tell you a lot of good there
is in it for you. C.R.
