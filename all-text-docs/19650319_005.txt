Because nobody but the IMAC officers seem to know!
the IMAC point system, it might be well to explain it |
this year before the overall standings come out again and
everybody gets p.o.’ed again about how in the world
everybody else finished ahead of them. |

Sports are divided into three categories: major (flick-
erball, basketball, softball, and volleyball), intermediate |
(swimming, wrestling, track), and minor (handball and’
tennis). |
_ According to the point system, a team gets 50 points
for entrance in a major sport, which is usually automatic, |
100 points are alloted as achievement points, and addi-
tiona] points are awarded for the first five places (10, 7,
5, 3, and 1 respectively).

Achievement points are awarded by dividing the num-,
ber of wins by the championship team in a major sport
into 100 and then determining teams’ totals by multiply-
ing their number of wins by the quotient derived above.
For instance, the Kappa Sigs won 12 flickerball games;
thus each win was worth 8-1/3 points. A team that won
9 games and finished third would get 50 entrance points,
75 achievement points, and 5 points for finishing third,
for a total of 130 points in flickerball.

Intermediate and minor sports are scored generally
the same way, except that 40 entrance and 80 achieve-
ment points are alloted for the middle bracket, and 30
entrance and 60 achievement points are given for minor
sports.

The thing that is unfair about this system is arbitrarily
designating some sports as major, intermediate, and mi-
nor, with little justification for the point differences
awarded. Certainly basketball should be worth more than
handball, but why should volleyball be worth more than
track, or swimming be more important than tennis?

A more equitable situation would have two classifica-
tions; a major sports bracket would be for the sports that
are both team sports and in which standings are deter-
mined by a playing season in which every team meets
every other team, i.e. flickerball, basketball, and softball.

Minor sports would be those not meeting both of these
requirements. There are more participants in some of
these sports, such as swimming and track, but round-
robin schedules or double-elimination tournaments which
are not decided in a single day give more accurate and
fairer standings in sports such as tennis and handball.

In other words, there isn’t enough difference between
volleyball and the “intermediate” and “minor’’ sports to
warrant different categories and different point allot-
ments, thus penalizing fraternities strong in the “minor”
sports to the advantage of those strong in “intermediate”
sports.

Another inequity in the IMAC program is the incon-
sistency in barring members of the freshman football,
basketball, baseball, and tennis teams from participating
in these sports, but having the two-day tournaments or
meets early enough so that freshman swimming, track,
and wrestling team members can participate. To con-
tinue in their inconsistency, the IMAC rules bar fresh-
men from participating in indoor track, but allow the
other spring track team members to participate.

The IMAC’s purpose is to provide organized athletics
for students who aren’t on teams representing the col-
lege. Eligibility should be determined with this in mind.

Of course, the main obstacle to providing a fairer sys-
tem of eligibility has been the attitude of freshman coach-
es, as this year’s IMAC can readily attest.

Admitted, it isn’t that big a deal, but it is hoped that: games and dropping one. They took the Sig Eps, 53-40,

spring will do something about the system, which has re-
mained unchanged for years.

LEFTY’S CAMP te '
Lefty reports that the applications for his summer bas-|""

ketball camp have started to flow. The boys coming, rang: |' 2i
ing in age from 8 to 18, will pay $80.00 for a week of bas- | .z
ketball instruction by the Wildcat coaching staff and this |:
year's varsity and freshman team members. There will] ;

be three sessions, June 20-26, July 25-31. and August 1-7.

These basketball camps on college are getting to be a/"
big thing, and Lefty was an instructor at several camps
last summer. It’s a good aid in recruiting both from the|
standpoint of public relations and from the fact that
many of the top high school players attend.

And the money doesn’t exactly make the instruction
chores distasteful.

in matches Monday and Tuesday at

foes, Gene Alien and Wayne
Willis, 6-0, 6-0. Parrot and Muel-
ler remained undefeated with a

lowing only six hits in a pitch.
ing duel with three Pfeiffer -hurl-
ers.

Jim Hyder led the Wildcat of-
fense, getting two hits and scor
ing the only run. Lance Taylor
and Don Davidson accounted for
Davidson's other base hits in the
loss.

The game was tied 1-1 until
the sixth imning, when a close
call at the plate gave the Fal-
cons their’ onerun winning
mark.

Stevens moaned, “With a little
more hitting, we could have
won easily. The rest of the week
till be spent working on hit-
ling. with emphasis on batting
against pitchers throwing stuff.
We hope to correct our mistakes
and even the score this Satur-
day.”

Nu’s Take Delts In Bball,
But Sigs Sure Of First

The Sigma Nus dominated the past we ek’s Imac basketball action by winning two

and the Phi Delts by four

With only one week left in the
IMAC basketball season, the
Kappa Sig's have finished with
a 12-0 record, and are thus the
only undefeated team in the
league.

The Pikas
Gams, 52-42.

The Fiji-Pika contest was
closer than the score indicated.

One of the Pika's top scorers
in the game. Bob O'Kelly, suf-
fered a busted lip early in the
fourth quarter which put him
out and allowed the Gams to go
ahead for good. With a short-
age of substitutes the Pikas
were unable to keep up and the
Gams went on to win by 10

lost to the Phi

| points.

In the Indy-Sigma Nu game
Jim Fuller got 25 for the Indys
as Arthur Clark and Bill Bar-
nette scored all but six of the

 Nu's 82 points. Clark and Bar-

nette starred again as the Nu's
beat the Phi Delts.

There are only six games re-
maining in this year’s schedule.

Davidson assistant coach Joe
Hunt will coach the team.

Cunningham’s team a 1s 0
boasts several stars. Besides
the Kangaroo Kid, there will be
N. C. State’s Larry Lakins who
recently got 33 points against
St. Joseph's; Wake Forest pro-
vides Richard Herring: North
Carolina adds Ray Respass and
Bill Brown, Duke sends the in-
imitable Hack Tison: the
ubiquitous Denny Ferguson,
and Brent Kitchen.

Frank McGuire of USC will
probably ocach the team.

The game shapes up as a here
tofore unheard of attraction in
this area. In one way, it is a
conference struggle between
some of the best players .in the
Southern. and Atlantic Coast
Conferences. The prestige of the
two is definitely on the line.

In another way, it is a clash
between Fred Hetzel and Billy
Cunningham, the top players jn
their respective conferences.
Hetzel finlshed with a 26 point

scoring average with Cunning-
ham one behind at 25-points a
game. They both averaged
close to 13 rebounds a game.

Hetzel commented on the up-
coming clash by saying, ‘I’ve
been looking forward to playing
against Billy Cunningham for
the. la&t four years. I also think
we will have two well balanced
teams out there.’’

Baseballers Boot First

The Wildcat nine will play
Pfeiffer again at 2 p.m. tomor-
row at Davidson.

In still a third way, the game
can be thought of as an all-star
game featur.ng the best talent
the area. Each player wll be
ifying to put on the b's. show
possible. which should provide
for first class sports enter:ain
ment.

As Hetzel said, the teams are
well balanced. The W.ldcais.
hav.ng played together for four
years, might have a slightly bet-
ter defense. As far as rebound.
ing is concerned, Terry Holland
will really have to come through
to help Hetzel and Davidson

Taylor Blackwell,. Davidson
publicity d.rector, is handling
the game as a “‘spare time ven-
ture,

“This game.” he said. “is an
experiment to see if future
games of this type might be
played in Charlotte on an annual ,
basis, Charlotte being the big
basketball city that it is.”

He also said- that advance
ticket sales have been good. Stu-
dent tickets may be purchased

Golfers Breeze By 3
In Dunes Club Match

Cavidsoh's golfers swepi a four-way match from
Southern Conference Opponents George Washing-
ton, Furman, and The Citadel, Monday while losing
only one of the medal positions of the Dunes Club

in Myrtle Beach.

This is the second time in three years that David-
son has won this conference foursome.

Doug McKeever tied for runner-up honors with
The Citadel’s Bob Coleman, both scoring 76, while
Bob Bowers of George Washington was the medalist
of the day with the low score of 75. .

' Golf mentor Dr, Tom Scott had nothing but praise
for the “well-balanced scoring” of the team. Da-
vidson’s top four scorers had a mere four strokes

separating them.
Bill Ross fired

a 77, Champ Covington carded 78,

sophomore Joe Jelks finished with a 79, and George
Brewer and Mackey McClelland took a pair of 80's.

Davidson emerged from the match with a 3-0 rec-
ord and G. W. drew its first loss while placing sec-
ond. The Citadel finished its 18 holes in third place
while Furman failed to win a medal position.

In sizing up the outlook for the rest of the season,
Coach Scott forecasted, “We will be a top contender
for the Southern Conference championship. It all
depends on how strong V. P. I. is, but you can be
sure that we will be tough.”

Davidson will test V. P_ I. April 5.

Tracksters Hold High

t

Hopes For Good Yea

By STEVE BROWN
Davidsonian Sports Writer

r

“Prospects are very good for a rather successful track season this year,” pre-

, dicts Coach Heath Whittle.
“We have a good chance to
win all our dual meets—even the
one with Wake Forest, which I
regard as our. strongest oppon-
ent — and to take a fourth or
fifth place in the conference
-meet. Of course, it’s still a little
early to make extensive predic-
tions, though.”

Whittle cites the balance of the
Wildcat squad with its strength
in every event as an important
point and singled out several
runners who “really ought to
have a great year for us."’ The

Rifle Team Takes
Second In Stale

Davidson's rifle team took sec-
ond place in the North Carolina
State Rifle Tournament Satur-
day, as the North Oarolina State
team eked out top honors at Ra-
leigh. ;

Wake Forest placed third over
teams representing West Point,
North Carolina State Air Force,
University of North Carolina
ROTC, and North Carolina A&T
College.

Outstanding marksman for the
Davidson squad was junior Jim
Kopp, who as second high scor-
er in the match took three med-
als overall. These awards in-
cluded one for being the high
man on the Davidson team; one
for the high score, standing po-
sition: and one for third place,
kneeling position.

Other members of the Wildcat
team included James Clark, Art
Abplanalp, Wes Bailey, Will Nor-
man, and Ed Maxwell.

This match gives the team-a
7-6 record for the season with
one tournament remaining, the
Twelfth Corps sector match at
the University of North Carolina
this weekend.

Ashcraft’s time in 1955.

He points to seniors Tommy
Heffner and Denny Phillips as
strong milers and comments
that John Barow. a senior: Andy
Little, a junior; and Robert
Dean, a sophomore: should pro-
vide ‘‘a strong field” in the two.

Alan Turner, the Southern Con-

other great year for Alan.

ing on Jim Wallace, who's been
doing a fine job in the discus,
and David Brown, a ut lity man
who can jump, vault, «and run.
In addition, sophomores Bill
Kendrick (javelin), John Fagg
(shot put), and Bili Randolph
(shot put, discus) brighten the
long range outlook for the
team.”

Davidson's track mentor adds

that the ‘season opener with Le-
nuir Rhyne and High Point at
Davidson tomorrow afternoon
“should be an exciting contest
(Field events begin ‘at 2 and
running events at 3). They'll be
strong especially in their vault-
ers -but I think we can take
them,” he grins.
