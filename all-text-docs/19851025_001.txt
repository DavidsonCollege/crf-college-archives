College establishes Arnette Memorial Book Fund

By NELLE McCORKLE

The Davidson College com-
munity has established an en-
dowed book fund at the E.H. Lit-
tle Library in memory of Nancy
Rodden Amette, who died last
Wednesday after an extended ill-
ness.

Arnette started working for
the college 11 years ago as secret-
ary for the Self-Study and in 1975
became secretary to the vice-pres-
ident for academic affairs T.C.
Price Zimmermann.

Many members of the faculty
and staff worked closely with Ar-
nette through the Academic Af-
fairs Office. Wednesday, several
commented on their colleague and
friend.

History Professor David Shi
noted the appropriateness of the
Book Fund, saying: “Perhaps be-
cause of her own background as a
former English major in college,
Nancy seemed to take an espe-
cially keen and sincere interest in

what faculty members were re-
searching and writing about. I re-
member being somewhat taken
aback when she told me how
much she had enjoyed reading one
of my books.

“It was a joy to walk into her
office because you could always
count on her greeting you with a
smile and a genuine interest in
your work and family.”

Director of South Asian
Studies I. Job Thomas said “It’s so
hard to think that someone so
businesslike and cheerful who
made you so comfortable and was
so full of good spirit within a very
short time is not there any more.”

Zimmermann said: “Nancy
Arnette was in every way an ex-
ceptional person. Unfailingly
cheerful and optimistic under the
stress of life’s daily routines, she
faced the supreme test of a mortal
illness with magnificent resources
of perserverance and courage. Her
responses to the difficult decisions

she faced were characteristically
generous. She submitted herself
to protracted and often painful
treatments out of a loving sense of
responsibility to those whom she
knew depended on her.

“Outgoing in her concern for
and support of others, she was
herself a very private person, pre-
ferring to carry her own burdens
as quietly as possible, revealing
them only to a few close friends.
Even on the most difficult days
she had for everyone a smile, a
cheerful word, a sympathetic ear.

“When disappointed in people
she still bore no grudges, prefer-
ring to live at peace with others
and herself. She talked little about
her faith and lived it much. That is
a lesson we can all learn from the
example of her life.”

Loyce Davis, Secretary to the
President, said, “I have lost a dear
friend and co-worker. Nancy and I
shared so much over the more than
ten years she sat across the hall

Convocation features Rusk,

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Former Secretary of State
Dean Rusk ’31 spoke at Fall Con-
vocation yesterday concerning the
possibilities of future nuclear war
and answered questions from a
student panel on topics of current
international salience.

Rusk first reminisced about
his childhood when he would re-
cite the first question of the Pre-
sbyterian catechism, “What is the
chief end of man?” He said that
“many years later, in the Cuban
missile crisis, it was sobering to
realize that this had become an
operating question before govern-
ments of the world.”

He said that in 1959 author
C.P. Snow predicted a nuclear
war would come within 10 years.
“But in 1985, we have put behind
us 40 years without the firing of a
single nuclear weapon in anger,”
Rusk said. He continued: “I men-
tion this as a partial antidote to all
the Doomsday talk which has
been boomed at you from all di-
rections.

“My approach [to nuclear
war] is not rooted in a fear which
leads to irrational thought, but in
the reality of the enormous power
of human beings who have eaten
the fruits of the tree of the knowl-
edge of good and evil. The fingers
on the nuclear triggers are not
itching, waiting for a pretext to
pull them. We have learned in
these 40 years that the Soviets
have no more interest in destroy-
ing mother Russia than we have in

destroying” America.

Thus, in our diplomatic rela-
tions with the U.S.S.R., Rusk
said: “We and the Russians must
learn not to play games of chicken
with each other. You might have
nuclear war if people are driven
into a corner. For that reason John
F. Kennedy went to special pains
not to drive Mr. Kruschev into
that corner. I think we and the
Russians need to watch the level
of rhetoric between our two sides,
because it’s always possible that
either side could believe the
rhetoric.”

He added: “We ought to be
able to find a way to reduce these
stockpiles of weapons among frail
human beings.”

On the November summit be-
tween Gorbachev and Reagan,

Rusk commented: “I hope they
will not waste time with ideologi-
cal invective against each other. I
hope they would have the sense
not to make threats to each other,
but would try to find the greatest
common interests and responsibil-
ities which we and they share. At
the moment, I would hope that
Gorbachev and Reagan shake
hands and go away without doing
any damage.”

Concerning the role of the
media in international affairs,
Rusk said: “There is no question
that the media plays an increasing
role in handling international mat-
ters. The very answer given to the
question, ‘what is news?’ by the

news media can’t help but give us
a distorted view of the world.”

Rusk stated that most treaties
and agreements between countries
are kept, and most countries are at
peace, but ‘‘agreement, normality
and serenity are not newsworthy.
And there are also problems with
context of time.”

Rusk commented that the
problem of terrorism “is one of the
most difficult problems which we
have to deal with.” He said that

from me — and I don’t have to tell
you that I miss her greatly. She
was one of the brightest, most lov-
ing, Compassionate and unselfish
people I have ever known. She
taught all of us who were close to
her just what courage means.”

Davidson resident Mary Vir-
ginia Ratliff, who worked with
Arnette on a United Methodist
Church study of higher education,
called Arnette “unpretentious in
spite of the fact that she had so
many abilities. She could do any-
thing!”

Ratliff’s husband, economics
professor Charles Ratliff sang
with Arnette in the choir of the
Davidson United Methodist
Church; he described Arnette as
“keenly perceptive” and having a
“loving relationship with all other
people.”

Sociology/Anthropology Pro-
fessor Rosemary Zumwalt called
Arnette “absolutely competent in
everything she did...she could

handle any number of things and
remain collected and happy and
cheerful.

“[ found her to always be
warm and friendly and willing to
talk — very intellectually curious
— we exchanged thoughts on
Margaret Mead’s Blackberry
Winter . . . Nancy was a person
with a lot of dimensions.

“I’m about to plant my bulbs
this year, and I remember discus-
sing them last year with Nancy.
This year when they come up I'll
think about Nancy.”

Rick Love, Assistant to the
President, said: “I suppose when
we say so readily that it’s the
people who make Davidson spe-
cial, each of us has specific indi-
viduals in mind. Nancy has been
one of those individuals for me,
for many of us. We'll miss her as a
bright and capable colleague, but
even more as.a dear, dear friend’”

JYA Inauguration

Reinhardt Paul Gunther.

College officially announces
JYA program switch

By NELLE McCORKLE

and AARON LEVINE

The JYA program with the
Julius-Maximilians University in
Wirzburg, Germany was offi-
cially inaugurated on Thursday at
the Fall Convocation.

The official signing of the
agreement between President
Theodore Berchem of Wiirzburg
and President Kuykendall took
place an hour before the convoca-
tion itself.

Under the agreement's terms,
up to thirty students will study at
Wirzburg beginning in 1986.
Davidson will provide two full
scholarships for Wirzburg stu-
dents to study here.

Presidents Kuykendall and
Berchem signed the agreement at
9:30 a.m. in the Baxter-Davidson
Room in Chambers. After the
signing of the agreement, which
Registrar Sue Ross sealed,
Kuykendall toasted, “We raise
our glasses in celebration of this
happy day.”

During the Convocation itself,
in further recognition of the sign-
ing, Berchem and Wirzburg
Chancellor Reinhard Paul
Ginther were presented with hon-
orary doctorates, in letters and
laws, respectively. Afterwards,
Berchem addressed faculty, staff,
and students.

In his speech Berchem quoted

Nietzche, saying, * . @ true
education only begins high above
the world of necessity, of struggle
for existence, and of need.”

Wirzburg 18 one of Ger-
many’s most prestigious univer-
sities. Nobel laureate in physics
William Roentgen, who disco-
vered the X-Ray in 1895, was a
faculty member. Five other Nobel
recipients over the years, includ-
ing this year’s prizewinner in
physics, have had ties with the
school. Today the university has
established relationships with 13
foreign universities in 11 coun-
tries.
