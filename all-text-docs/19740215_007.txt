Riflers Ready For
Conference Meet

By BILL LLOYD
Staff Writer

The Davidson College rifle
team has had its problems
this year, but according to
team coach Abel White, ‘‘We
will definitely be ready for the
Southern Conference Tour-
nament in March.”

White is almost apologetic
in his appraisal of the rifle
team's 3-7 record. ‘‘We are
shooting about 100 points
below what we should be
shooting for a variety of
reasons.”

As is the case with most
minor sports at Davidson,
neither the time nor the
money can be devoted to the
rifle team comparable to what
other schools spend.

Says White, ‘‘] myself have
three classes to teach, and the
students have a_ heavy
academic load; we just can’t
put the time into practice as is
done at other schools.’,

He encourages his team
to shoot at least three times a
week but realizes it is left
up to the student.

White is most emphatic in
his praise of several out-
standing shooters, especially
Ross McCloy and Mary Tur-
ner.
“‘Both Mary and Ross have
shot well in our three wins
over Georgia Tech, University
of Richmond, and The Citadel.
In fact, Mary came in second
in the meet against Rich-
mond.”

A rifle match consists of six
participants shooting with the
top five scores counted. The
maximum agree gee

According to te, ‘We
are capable of shooting at
least 1300, but so far this
season we have been
averaging around 1200 with a
season high of 1269.”

The only girl competing on
the team, Turner, had never
even shot a gun before she
came to Davidson.

: “I came down last spring for
the intramural rifle com-
. petition as kind of a joke. I did

“‘Being a hall counselor can
get kind of nerve-wracking
sometimes, and I find that
going down and shooting for a
while can relieve some of the
tension,’’ she said.

The Citadel beat the David-
son team in its most recent
match.

“Their first team scored
1365; we shot a 1269, and their
second team scored a 1267.
This was our highest score for
the year, but I am stil] a little
disappointed,’’ White said.

McCloy shot a 269, and Tur-
ner had a 254.

“I am just sorry that Mary
is a senior,’ White com-
mented.

White was optimistic about
the future of the team. ‘‘We
are not shooting 1300, but
there is no doubt in my mind
that we have the potential.”’

On March 8, the rifle team
fires at Wofford, and on the
13th against Clemson. On the
16th the team travels to V.M.I.
for the Southern Conference
Tournament.

“The team has lots of prac-
tice time before the tour-
nament, and if we can shoot
1300 there, we can be third in
the conference,’’ White

predicted.

A League Tournament

By CAPTAIN AMERICA
and

BUCKY

Tournament action nears its
end as 2 lot of upsets (or not so
upsets depending on where
you eat) have marked the play
in the tournament.

In the B League tourney
there were 4 teams left in the
single elimination biggie as of
Tuesday. It was the Strong
Brothers of the Miles Glorious
team leading their boys to the
semis, with a big win over
IFT, (I Felta Thi), but alas,
half the brother act disap-
peared as Jon Strong wren-
ched his knee in his team’s
quarter final win.

Meanwhile, their opponent
in the semi berth, the tennis-
loaded Wha Tan Upp con-
tinued to rag people, because
they are a misplaced A
League team. Ed Patten, a
jayvee transfer, Rick ‘‘Air-
ball” Quimby and Jim Dorsett
have led Jeff ‘‘Golderi Wheels’’
Frank to his first big season.

Jeff had this to say about
this season’s fortunes ..... “
IMAC refs_ should be
castrated,” Well, nice talking
to you Jeff. They defeated the
AlkWeinie Hellraisers to get to
thier berth.

In the other semi bracket
the old pros, Several Species,
are plodding their way to the
finals once more. The an-
cient ones, led by Tom Cose,
Chris Holly and Dave
Duggins, three of the higher
orbiting people on campus,
have gotten the honor of
meeting the infamous Funks
Farmers, who defeated a
heavily favored PDT #3 in a
big upset.

In the eight-team double

A there was a wile dhatin

going on, as only the Old Men
survived with their unbeaten
status through the early
games.

PGD, playing real hot b-

ball,
they beat both the formerly
unbeaten SAEs and pre-
a favorites Hobeken
. The hot ing of
Bob Sanders and Gare Yeung
with the steady play of the
Stick have put the PGD up
against the Old Men in the
winners bracket. An _in-
teresting game, to say the
least, as the Old Men are led

by the brilliant play of All-
Everything, Jimmy the Greek.
Just ask the Delts or Little Big
Men who this man is.

The Little Big Men won a big
one before falling to the Oldies
as they ambushed the un-

ing Cleveland Indians

make up what is probably
the best ‘real team” in the
tourney. .

Both Delts and Q-12 were
eliminated as the Delts lost to
theOld Men and then the In-
dians. Q-12 threw a scare into
