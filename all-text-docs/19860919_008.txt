What were the Trustees thinking?
That is a question that has entered my
mind many times since the decision to
meve tothe Colonial League was made. I
tried to reserve judgement until .all the
facts were in. I kept telling myself that
they must know something. Surely they
would not-simply cast our athletic pro-
gram into-a void. I wanted to believe that
somehow, things would work out. Tues-
day, however, it became apparent that
there would be no pleasant surprise, no
Trustees smiling and saying “See, we

“ knew it would be okay the whole time.”

Wildcats falter under second half pressure

Tuesday, it became very apparent that it-
would most certainly not be okay. Tues-’
day, the Southern Conference voted 4-3
to deny Davidson’s request to remain in
the conference without playing football.

I sympathize with the Trustees’ des-
ire to see the football team be competi-

painful it can be to watch the Cats getting
trounced regularly by their SC oppo-
nents, but I question the logic of tossing
away automatic NCAA bids in basketball
and baseball as well as the great rivalries

that have developed in the SC in order to.

much farther away and against whose
members we are 0 for our last 10.

While it is “painful to watch the
Davidson footballers get slaughtered
week after week in the SC, I have a feel-
ing it might be even more painful to
watch our basketba i team play a season
with virtually no hope of attending the
NCAA tournament. It might be painful
also ta watch our recently rejuvenated
men’s sport program deteriorate because
we no longer have a competitive confer-

What were they thinking ?

stead of being excited over their achieve-
ments, we can only wonder: about their
future.
~I believe the Trustees must have
thought that we would be allowed to re-
main in the Southern Conference. Maybe
they overestimated the value of tradition.
Davidson has a great basketball name and
fifty years of history in the Southern Con-
ference, but ultimately, it was - not
enough. And now we are on our own.
All is not lost of course. There are
other conferences out there, and some
might be better for Davidson than-the SC.
The best alternative seems to be the Colo-
nial Athletic Association (not to be con-
fused with the Colonial League) which
contains schools such as Navy,
Richmond, and James Madison. It would
be an ideal place for Davidson. The only
problem is they don’t seem interested.

A second half slump kept the -

Davidson football team out of,the
end zone and out of the win col-
umn as it blew a 10-6 lead and fell
to the Wofford Terriers 20-10 last
Saturday.

The Wildcats led 10-6 after a
sloppy first half for both teams.
The Terriers turned the ball over
-four times: in the half, including
two fumbles and an interception

- on their first three possessions.

~~ —~Davidson’s offense could gen-
erate no momentum either. The
Cats were never able to put to-
gether a strong drive. They gave
. the’ball up on punts five times and
lost one fumble deep in Wofford
territory in the first half.

The 10-6 lead the Cats held at
the halfway mark came as a result
of Wofford turn-overs.

Davidson opened a 3-0 lead
when Wofford fumbled on their
own 17-yard line. Senior quarter-

+ back Jack McCollum was unable

" to advance the Cats, gaining just
four yards in three plays, so he
switched positions and kicked a
29-yard field goal.

Wofford answered midway
through the sécdnd quarter, mov-
ing the ball 72 yards in eight plays
for a touchdown. The Terriers
loosened the Wildcat defense with
a thixture of draws, sweeps and
passes. They scored on a 10-yard

sweep and led 6-3 after the extra’

. point attempt failed.
The Terriers returned to. their
earlier form on their next posses-

sion, though, tossing an intercep-
tion that sophomore cornerback
Steve Neff returned 24 yards to
the Wofford 27.

It took only three plays for
freshman quarterback Peter
Hughes, subbing for McCollum,
to get the Cats in the end zone for
their only touchdown of the day.
After an incomplete pass, Hughes
threw a strike to sophomore wide
receiver Michael Gross for a first
down at the 10-yard line.

On the next play, Hughes
lofted a beautifully-timed pass
over the shoulder of freshman
wide receiver Shan Teel in the left
comer of the end zone to give the
Cats the lead.

The first two possessions of,

the second half were enough to
bury the Cats.

Davidson received the kick-
off and took possession at its own
35-yard line after a nice return.
Two plays moved the ball to the
48.

And then things fell apart.
Two penalties. moved the Cats
back to their own 33: first down,
25 yards to go. Three plays lost a
yard and the Cats were forced to
punt.

Wofford took possession at its
own 36-yard line and proceeded to
march, 64 yards i in 10 plays tor the

“lead-taking — and ultimately;

game-winning — touchdown.

The Wildcats never recovered”

from the chaos of their first second
half posséssion, combining penal-
ties (Davidson was penalized 12

times for 110 yards in the game)
and turn-overs to keep themselves

‘out of scoring position until the -

end of the game.

On their final possession, the
Cats managed a drive to the Wof-
ford two-yard line, but failed to
convert either a touchdown or a
field goal.

The Terriers scored an insur-
ance touchdown in the fourth
quarter for the final margin of 20-
10. Wofford marched 68 yards in
just four running plays, including
a 30-yard touchdown run, over a
tired and frustrated Wildcat defen-
sive unit.

Offensively , Saturday’s game
Saw some strong performances by
youthful Wildcats. Hughes played
nice game at quarterback, com-
pleting seven passes in 15 at-
tempts for 82 yards and a
touchdown. Gross also ptayed
well, catching three passes for 33
yards and rushing once on an end
reverse for 20 yards. One of
Gross’ receptions set up Hughes
second quarter touchdown pass.

Defensively, the Cats were led
by the gutsy play of senior defen-
sive end Mareus Allen. Hampered
by a leg injury, Allen played al-
most every defensive minute and
had four. tackles in the Wofford
backfield.

On Saturday the Cats travel to
Johnson City, Tennessee to meet
Southem Conference opponent
East Tennessee State. East Ten-
nessee was trounced by Appalac-
hian State and the Cats might be
able to pull an upset.

Davidson would be considered. What
would we do in the meantime? °

The Big South conference is new to
Division I, and might just be very taken
with Davidson’s name and basketball
tradition. The Big South, however, is
home to such big name programs as
Winthrop and Radford and has no auto-
matic NCAA bids for the conference
champs. It is, to put it mildly, a big step
down from the Southern Conference.

It may sound cruel and uncaring, but
we should have stayed in the Southern
Conference and closed our collective
eyes during football season. I realized it is
not an ideal situation to cast our football
team to the wolves to save all the ‘Other
sports, but is it not even worse to cast the
rest of teams‘to these wolves to save foot-
ball? Sacrificing one for the good of the
rest seems better than sacrificing the rest
for the good of one.

Maybe they weren’t.
