On Tuesday, February 16th in the 900 room
of the College Union, Janet Lepke, a professional
nutritionist-therapist, delivered a speech entitled
“Should I Break up with My Diet?” Originally
from Los Angeles, California, Lepke has recently
moved to the Charlotte area where she has started
a practice as a li-
censed dietician.

offered by large corporations such as Jenny Craig.

Before Lepke plunged into the guidelines for
a proper diet, she offered some of her personal
experiences with dieting. Studying nutrition, she
attended Cornell, University where she said she
“flirted with an eating disorder.” She went on to
explain that she “was constantly on some sort of
diet.”

After discussing her past experiences. with

ease, asking
how many people in the room knew someone with
an eating disorder. All of those who attended
raised their hands. She also gauged the opinion of
the audience on several topics with questions such
as whether or not the audience thought that people
are overweight simply because they have no will-
power.

Lepke then talked about the effectiveness of
various popular diet products that are on the mar-
ket today. She felt that Slim Fast, for example, was
an ineffective diet. Lepke said that when a person

is not consuming enough calories and not exercis- ,

ing, “the order of weight loss is water, lean muscle
mass, and then fat.” Explaining that the body first

problems listed were gallstones, cardiac disor-

and fatigue.
Lepke
concluded her
speech by offering
advice about how

etary supple-

ment that Lepke discussed was metabolism-en-
hancing pills. “The only thing that really helps
metabolism is exercise,” she said.

The next topic that Lepke touched upon was
the pressure in today’s society to diet. She dis-
cussed the countless magazines such as Shape and
Self, which promote weight loss, as well as the
images offered to youth of extremely thin women.
On television today, 80% of characters are slim.
“There are eight supermodels in the world,” she
said. “Most of them are airbrushed.” She contin-
ued by saying, “We strive for an ideal that just
doesn’t exist. It isn’t real.”

According to Lepke, diets can be dangerous
when they get out of control. “Seventy percent of
bulimic women were previously dieters,” she said.
She also cited the many health complications that

to eat properly.
She encouraged those present to be careful with
their approach to dieting. “Be aware of what your
motives are,” she said. “What are you hoping to
accomplish?” She also warned those considering
a diet not to deprive themselves of food when they
are hungry. “Eat when you’re hungry,” she said.
“Thinking you can’t have it drives you more nuts
than just having it.” Finally, Lepke stressed the
importance of exercise, recommending that a per-
son exercise at least five days a week for twenty to
forty-five minutes.

After the conclusion of her speech, Lepke
invited students to ask any questions they might
have had pertaining to dieting or nutrition. Lepke’s
speech was a part of the activities for eating
disorders week.

According to legend, Nian is
the reason the New Year is
celebrated. Today, the color
red is also used for decora-
tive purposes; houses are
decorated with. red paper,
firecrackers are set, and
money is given to children in
red envelopes. ‘The Spring
Festival is like Christmas cel-
ebrations in the United States,
but without the religious as-
pect. It is a time to get to-
gether with family and
friends, exchange gifts, and
decorate the house,” said Dr.
Vivian Shen, a Davidson pro-
fessor of Chinese.

Though the Chi-
nese celebrate the Spring Fes-
tival worldwide, each family
and each region may have a

different way of celebrating. At Davidson, the
festivities began on the Chambers lawn with a
traditional Lion Dance. A dinner followed the
dancing with food from Lotus. The festivities

“The Spring Festival is like
Christmas celebrations in the
United States, but without the
religious aspect. It is a time to
get together with family and
friends, exchange gifts, and
decorate the house.”

finally came to a close with a Chinese New Year
discussion. Though the celebrations at Davidson
lasted for about 2 hours, Spring Festival activities
can run for three days. The ending of festivities
marked the start of the New Year, the year of the
Rabbit.
