MARTIN AS ADVISER

Dr. J. G. Martin will be the faculty
adviser to the Union staff this summer
during the time that Mr. Smith and his
family are touring the west. Dr. Martin
plens to sit in on the staff “idea
sessions," and the output of this group
will, in a large part, reflect his
thought. |

Dr. Martin is class of '56, and re-
ceived his docorate at Princeton
University. He returned to Davidson in
the fall of 1960 and has, since that
time, guided many of us through the
‘labyrinths of organic chemistry.
