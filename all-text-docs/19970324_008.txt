_ OPINIONS

MONDAY, MARCH 24, 1997

I thought that all of the debate
surrounding the sorority issue had
subsided two years ago. I guess I
was wrong given the fact that I have
spent most of my senior spring im-
mersed in recycled arguments/con-
versations about bringing sororities
to Davidson. This time around I do
applaud the efforts and motivation
to actually introduce a proposal.

With that compliment given, I
have to say that I found the written
proposal presented to the PCC be-
littling to eating houses and women
in general. Here’s why: According
to the National Panhellenic defini-
tions, “Sororities promote sound
scholarship, leadership ability, com-
munity outreach and lifelong friend-
ships” none of which can be accom-
plished by eating houses, [am guess-
ing, since according to the proposal
they “revolve around parties and
eating with friends.” Interestingly
enough, an eating houses’ by-laws
stress the samé desire to provide
Davidson with an avenue for fe-
male interaction, companionship

and support. There is nothing in the’

above definition that is not achieved
by an eating house.

Sororities, they say, “could
never serve as the social focus for
women on campus.” Is it going to
be a spiritual focus? I think the 31
women who have pledged to join

this sorority might want to know.

The proposal also asserts that
eating houses only let you meet the
five women you joined with. Whose
fault is that? If you honestly only
eat, party, do community service,
etc with the same five women you
joined with then you are obviously
not taking advantage of being in a
house. It seems to me that there is
some sort of disillusion as to the
fact that sororities, like magic,
would give you fifty new best
friends. I guess that might be real-
istic if they are all carbon copies of
one another. But there is no way to
change the face of this school if
individuals don’t take charge and
make an effort. By naming a social

. organization a “sorority” you are

not going to endow individuals with
superhuman social strength that will
automatically create the desire to
bond. I would like to think that
Davidson women don’t need a so-
rority for the effect of “the bonds
that would be created would cross
over eating house lines and allow
Davidson women to create close

friendships with women from dif- °

ferent classes, different freshman
halls, and different eating houses,
thus easing the tensions.”

As for “no frills rush” and mu-

tual bids, let’s be realistic and not .

naive. It is an understatement to say

that “Obviously sororities must op-
erate rush according to some rules
and regulations.” Do you have any
idea what those rules are? I attended
the SouthEastern Panhellenic Con-
ference last year in Atlanta so I feel
like I could tell you how destructive
those rules are to women whoaren’t
“the norm” or a “legacy.” There is
a section in Part IV of the proposal
about advocating “fairness” and
“giving everyone a chance to join a
sorority who wants to.” Sororities
are anything but fair. A friend of
mine was crushed because all of her
friends got bids to a sorority and she
didn’t receive one because—oh,
wait, she was a little overweight
and we all know how much weight
has to say about an individual’s
personality. Hall counselors have
enough self-esteem issues to deal
with-they don’t need more.

Part three of the proposal ar-
gues that sororities are “held to-
gether by a closer bond than desire
to get involved, its like a sisterhood
of thousands that are looking out
for women all over the world.” I
think I am confused here because
according to this I should-only be
looking out for women who wear
the same letters thatIdo. All women
should be looking out for one an-
other regardless. “By being part of

a sorority you have the strength of
thousands of women behind you” I
would like to believe that I have the
strength of women behind me re-
gardless of whether or not I am a
Tri-Delt. The proposal claims a
“cohesiveness” among women but
it seems to me that for them this
cohesiveness only exists within the
confines of Greek letters.
Sororities would supposedly
offer more leadership opportunities
and committees: “This would not
only help create leadership skills in
women so that they would give
Davidson a good name when they

. go out and change the world.” I

think I have gained significant
enough leadership skills to give
Davidson a good name. In fact, I
should hope we all have—isn’t that
part of why we are here? It next
states that “The opportunities and
benefits for self growth, and per-
sonal strength building are unend-
ing and invaluable.

Is it fair that Davidson women
are deprived of obtaining that edge
onlife?” [like to think that Davidson
women are not “deprived” of an
“edge on life,” but rather are given
an unique experience to make the
best of. A Davidson woman has an
“edge” because she attends an in-
credible school, a school with the

_ guts to maintain its own identity

and not succumb to the pressures to
be like other schools that have so-
rorities.

I can’t help but think that all of
this energy could have been chan-
neled into existing groups on cam-
pus. The National Panhellenic of-
fers programs about abusive rela-
tionships, destructive sexual behav-
ior and personal safety—isn’t that
what Georgia Ringle is for? And
isn’t she more than willing to ad-
dress those issues anytime she is
invited to do so? If a Davidson
student is interested in such pro-
grams maybe she should visit a
Women’s Issues meeting orask your
RA or Hall Counselor to bring such
aprogram to her hall. We should be
utilizing resources that we have in-
stead of trying to introduce more.

And to those of you who are
thinking about how great being a
charter member will look on your
resume—TI feel certain that there are
various other ways that you could
contribute to this campus that Ca-
reer Services would smile upon.

Finally, I would not have come
to Davidson if sororities were
present. I was impressed by an
environment that did not foster such
exclusiveness. And I sure would
not have been the president of Rusk
if I had thought bringing sororities
to Davidson was a good idea.

In Defense of Sororities

I hate the word “sorority.” It
brings to mind brainless, material-
istic girls who haven’t a care in the
world besides rushing and shop-
ping and wearing their “fancy Greek
letters,” as Caroline Hubbell and
Hunter McEaddy pointed out.

This stereotype bothers me be-
cause it does not do justice to the
concept of sororities. Granted, I do
know a number of sorority girls
who encompass all and more of
these characteristics,

achoice between sororities and self-
selection, but they don’t discuss the
fact that the court, with fraternities,
technically does have a process of
self-selection. Rush can and does
coexist with self-selection. We can
have both. ;

The most important part of so-
rorities also happens to be the as-
pect that is most essential to our
campus. I am jealous of the bonds
of friendship I see in fraternities.

a smaller group, we would at least
know the names of all of our soror-
ity sisters. Let’s stop pretending
that our eating house is a big group
of friends without any cliques; we
all know that is not the truth. We
also invest very little in the self-
selection process—we. write our

. choices on a piece of paper and slip

it under our hall counselor’s door.
We don’ thave much to take pride in
because we have not worked for

but it does not have to
be that way.

It is time to start
giving ourselves
some credit. We are
on the outside of the
sorority circuit look-
ing in. This means
we have the clear vi-
sion it takes to make
sororities on this cam-

We need opportunities to form
closer friendships. We need

take pride in.

We need more options.

anything; our mem-
bership has been
handed to us.

T like Rusk and I
have fun there, but I
am not happy with
the system of eating
houses we have at
Davidson. We need
something much
smaller. We need

pus anything we want them to be.
We know what we don’t like about
sororities and have the power to
ensure that these things do not make
their way into our own system. We
are not buried under years of Greek
tradition, we have no obligations,
we have no one to please but our-
selves.

Ihave heard the concerns about
rush and its ramifications, and I am
also concerned, but sororities can
be fair. Rush and pledging can be
friendly experiences. Hunter and

‘Caroline stress that we have to make

Davidson women do not have the
opportunities to form these kinds of
relationships.

Women’s eating houses are
way too large. I cannot remember
the last time I walked into Rusk and
recognized every face there. Hunter
and Caroline argue that Davidson
should not be about cliques, and I
agree. No one can deny, however,
that cliques have formed in eating

houses. In Rusk, we have about 200
girls. There is no way we can be ©

close friends with everyone, so we
hang out with the girls we know. In

Opportunities to
form closer friendships. We need
something we can work for and take

Once we are able to look past the
stigma of sororities, we will begin
to see the advantages of what this
kind of organization has to offer.

_ We have these benefits at our
fingertips. Wehave the intelligence,
the principles, and the vision that it
takes to ensure that these benefits
take precedence.

We have the power to make
sororities at Davidson work in our
favor.

Everyone senses the physical
transformation that has filled our
campus. Spring has brought beau-
tiful weather, flowering trees, fresh
air, and blooming flowers. It is a
time of terrific growth and new-
ness. It is a beautiful distraction,
and one we should enjoy as much
as we can.

But the awesome growth, new
life, and sense of joy do not stop
with the natural world around us.
Spring is also a time symbolic of a
powerful change inside a person’s
heart. For during the Easter sea-
son, all of us who choose to believe
celebrate the new life that is in
Jesus Christ and rejoice at His liv-
ing within our hearts. Although
life in Christ is “year-round” and
though we should rejoice in Christ
always (I Thess. 5:16), each Easter
we focus on the celebration of our
Lord’s death and subsequent res-
urrection. For itis by the power of

us into life with joy.
Traditionally, the church fo-
cuses on Christ’s suffering or pas-
sion (from Latin pati, “to suffer’’)
during Holy Week, which began
yesterday with Palm Sunday. Con-
gregations read the gospel accounts
of the events leading up to Jesus’
crucifixion. We think about
Christ’s precious death and its pur-
pose, although we cannot fathom
the love that God’s gift entails.
Three plain trees, to be planted
for this week, will join the beauti-
ful, flowering trees of spring. They

The Easter Crosses

His resurrection that He receives

are crosses, set up again by Chris-
tian individuals as a reminder of
Jesus’ last week on the earth. We
hope that the display will add per-
spective to our lives in the last few
days before break. We realize that
different individuals will see dif-
ferent meanings in the crosses.
Some may ask why they stand
where they do. Some may cry out
that religion is being forced upon
others.

- Christians see these man-
made trees as bare and brutal in
their function as an awful means
of execution, but we also see the
crosses as symbols of new life and
hope. For the cross on which Jesus
died marks our entrance into life.
Our desire is not to put down any-
one or to assert the right to put up
adisplay but to express God’s love
for each person in the world. We
hope to share this love outside the
four walls of a church and to recall
this love in our daily walks.

So as you pass by the crosses
this week, please remember the
message and intent behind them:
the pain and death of Good Friday
ends in triumph when Jesus is
raised on Easter morning.

If you have questions or com-
ments, know that you can call a
student on the list to be posted with
the crosses. If you would like to
add your name to those who have
volunteered to support the display
and to be available for discussion,
please call 896-6335. Have a won-
derful, joyous Easter Break,
