THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 29, 1920.

PHI’'S CARRY OUT

REGULAR PROGRAM

Eu’s Fail to Agree on Subject for

ebate.

Philanthropic Society.

Program for October 30, 1920. 4

Debate:

Affirmative : Negative:
W. K. McCain J. F. Clark
C. W. Robinson T. A. Freeman
D. R. Freeman W. P. Brown

Extemporaneous Debate:

D. W. Lowrance R. H. Poole

Declamation or Oration:

J. C. Wool G. N. Neel

According to custom the Phi Society
met Saturday night, and after roll call
by the secretary and devotional by J. W.
Baldwin, the following program was
rendered; for the regular. debate, the
subject was: “Resolved, that the his-
tory of labor unions in the U. S. has
shown a principle detrimental to the
interests of the country.” The socicty
had the privilege of hearing “Rifle
Rest,” the lineal descendant of Champ
Clark. He showed rare form in his
eloquent defense of the affirmative. To
his most honorable colleague must go
much credit for the great debate which
ended so unfavorably for the affirma-
tive. J. A. Poteat and S. R. Stoan un-
covered such. a line drive against the
arguments of the affirmative, that even
J. F. was ready a admit that he was
beaten. “*

D. W. Roberts and L. A. Taylor show-
ed wonderful examples of oratory in
their trials, but much to be regretted
was the inability of the hall to ap-
preciate their endeavors. Mr. Taylor
deserves special credit for the composi-
tion of his speech, if not for the de-

m livery. The extemporancous dehate was
» well up to standard with J. C. Wool,
. and C. W. Robinson upholding the af-

firmative and the negative respectively.
Each side produced many reasons why
or why not, Davidson should have
dancing as a part of its social functions,
but the affirmative won the judges’ ‘de-
cision. The society decided to hold the
regular meeting on next Saturday, un-
less a half-holiday is granted, in which

- case the program will be postponed un-

til November 6.

SIGMA UPSILON.

The regular meeting of the Blue
Pencil Chapter was held in the S. A. EF.
hall on last Wednesday night. Dr. Er-
win proved the feature of the program
with his interesting article on the “Rus-
sian Short Story.” This almost un-
known subject was dealt with in great
minuteness. The paper showed much
research work and thorough knowledge
of the subject.

D. W. Roberts read a verse of poctry
of the same meter as our Alma Mater
and with a similar thought. °

F. V. Long gave a review of one of
Locke’s books and created no little in-
terest in reading books by that author.

After a short business meeting the
fraternity adjourned for the initiation
of new members.

THE ST. CLAIRE SISTERS.

The St. Claire Sisters, a ladies’ quar-
tet, give a varied program, which
combines orchestral, vocal and special
novelty features. Audiences which
have heard the Military Girls or the
American Girls will find the same
brightness and sparkle which makes
these two companies so well remem-
bered. The St. Claire Sisters have al-
ready appeared on one of the Redpath
Chautauqua circuits with decided suc-
cess. The personnel of this company
is as follows: Ella St. Claire, soprano,
Diano, mandolin, banjo; Mary St.

COX-ROOSEVELT CLUB
CONTINUES WORK |

The Cox-Roosevelt Club has continued
the campaign for democracy, although it
was defeated in its endeavor to secure
Senator Lee S. Overman far an address, !
the senator already having all dates till
election filled. But this by no means}
indicates that they intend to recognize |
any defeat next Tuesday. At a short
meeting held last Wednesday morning
Dr. Lingle spoke to the members for a!
few moments urging every man of age
from North Carolina or from any other
state having absentee voting laws to
take full advantage of them, and thus |
be among the vast number who on
November 2, are going to show how
solid the glorious old Southland it. The
democrats of Davidson College, and be
it said that it would be difficult to find,
half a dozen from allt her student body |

i

who are not—have already faithfully
rendered their financial and moral sup-
port to their party, and the power of the
ballot alone remains in their hands.

If present plans can be successfully :

carried through the Cox-Roosevelt Ciub |
through special agreement with the W. |
U. Telegraph Company will furnish!
bulletin returns from the election on the |

night of November the second.

DAVIDSONIAN EDITOR
SPEAKS IN ROCK HILL

J. E. Cassell, of Christiansburg. Va.,
accompanied by J. C. Bailey, H. TH. Flill, |
John Roddy, W. T. Elliot, and D. RR!
Freeman, motored to Rock Hill last |
Saturady. to make a talk before a meet-
ing of the Hi-Y Club of that city. The
party left here Saturday «morning in
“C. J's" new Buick and spent the week-.
end in the “Good Town.”

The meeting was held in the Chamber
of Commerce hall and speeches, movies,
music, and eats were the principal at-
tractions. Cassell was the principal :
speaker and he made a very interesting
talk on The Life Worthwhile. Lieut. j
“Jimmie Dosier.” a wearer of a distin-.
guished service medal, made a few re-
marks and a moving picture of himself |
in action was then shown. The musical
side of the program was well taken care
of with two cornet solos by Freeman!
and with several “peppy” marches by
ithe Rock Hill Drum and Bugire Corps.
The mecting was brought to a close:
_with refreshments which were of course i
enjoyed to fullest extent by everybody. |

Cassell has for the past summer been
_comnected with the V. M. C. A. work in
Rock Hill, having had charge of the
“Y" camp on the Catawba River. The-
camp has been conducted for several |
summers without anyone in charge, but
the need of a good man to fake over!
the camp and to watch after the many |
youngsters who went out to enjoy a
night on the banks of the Catawba was i
very apparent. No better man could

have been found for the job for he was |
liked by both the kids and the older
folks and was welcomed back by all of
| his many acquaintances.
