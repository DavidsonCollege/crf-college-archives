VOTE OF STUDENTS |

ON AMENDMENTS
TO COME ON MAY 17

By TOMMY THOMPSON

After having the revised
amendments presented to the
student body today, an official
vote will be taken in ten days,
May 17. It is customary to
have the amendments tabled
for this period of time when,
at its conclusion, a two-thirds
vote of the attending student
body is required for the pass-
ing of the amendments.

The amendments, says Bob
Crutchfield, martyr of the amend-
ment cause, will be grouped ac-
cording to their specific relation
to each other. This procedure al-
lows the student body to express
outwardly wherein their intvrests
lie. Tentative plans are to combine
amendments 1 and § and 2 and 3,
leaving 4 and 6 to be voted on
separately.

Crutchfield, as well as other pro-
ponents of the amendments, have
been exasperated over the t .m-
ingly deliberate reluctance of the
Student Council to discuss the
amendments. Even though the vote
will be taken immediately before
the crucial exam period, Crutch-
field asks the student body to con-
sider seriously the amendments be-
fore poll time.

Debate on Qued in

In the climax of all .srmal dis-
cussions of the amendments, which
was held in a special assembly on
Wednesday, May 5, Bob Crutchfield
and Ed Stuart defended the
amendment, while Buddy Lamon
and Dick Roper headed the op-
position. The affirmative declared
that some of the major weaknesses
of student government were that
the Student Council does not rep-
resent student body viewpoints, is
void of all systematic trial proce-
dure, and is functioning on an am-
biguous constitution.

They uphold that the amendments
will begin, at least, to diminish
the present situation. Crutchfield
called on the Davidson student to
prove his maturity, so often
ridiculed, and accept the respon-
sibility of student government in-
vested in the revised amendment.
Stuart stated that amendment 5
was the most important amendment
from the standpoint that it is a
“strong” amendment and would,
consequently, motivate “strong”
government.

In opposition, Roper .asserted
that the amendments would assume
authority that the student body
does not have and that a “funda-
mental change” in the drinking
rule is needed. Lamon alleged the
illegality of amendment 2 by point-
ing it was contrary to the Rules
and Regulations of the Board of
Trustess, in which there is a rule
that states that all appeals must
be made directly to the faculty.

Lamon proposed a complete “re-
vision and overhauling” of the
present constitution and that the

Faculty-Student Day Will
Be Held On Wednesday

The annual Senior-Faculity Day will be held Wednesday
with a golf preliminary at Mooresville on Monday. After the
last athletic event on Wednesday the seniors will treat the
faculty to a fish fry at Erwin Lodge.

The faculty sportsmen, many of
whom were athletes in their own
right a few decades ago, have ex-
pressed through their spokesman,
Pete Whittle, the hope that “the
seniors try to make it interesting
for us this time.”

Somehow-—-perhaps mindful of
the approach of diploma time—the
senior classes of the past two years
have allowed the old-timers to
claim the win.

This year, however, the seniors
have announced their intention of
sweeping all four events. Charlie
Johnson, president of the class, has
invited the student body to witness
the mid-week massacre.

The events are scheduled as fol-
lows: Golf at 1:30 on Monday, ten-
nis at 2:00 on Wednesday, followed
at 3:00 With volleyball, and soft-
ball at 4:00.

Forty-five minutes after the
softball game the winners and
losers will meet at Erwin Lodge
for fish and fellowship.

The senior golf team, led by
Bob Owens, Ed Powe, Toto Wil-
Hamson, Mardre Bell and Dave
Pfaff, will face a dauntless aggre-
gation composed of Bill McGavock,
John McCutchan, Charlie Parker,
Henry Fulcher, Paul Scott, Danny

Bible Class Chooses
Sharp As President

In an election held on Sunday,
May 2, Buster Sharp. a rising
junior, was chosen to succeed
Swain Loy as president of the
YMCA Bible Class. Also elected
was Jerry Helms, to succeed Sandy
McGeachy, as secretary-treasurer.
Helms, too, is a rising junior.

So far Sharp has only made ten-
tative plans concerning next year’s
Bible Class. As it now stands, the
initial policy would be to abolish
any type of uniform lessons.
Sharp's second plan is to work in
coordination with the University
Christian Missions in sponsoring a
religious emphasis week in Feb-
ruary of next year.

By being elected president of the
Bible Class, Sharp will auto-
matically hold a seat in next year’s
Y Cabinet.

According to Sharp, the same
policy of serving coffee and do-
nuts before Bible Class will be
earried on throughout the coming
year.
