Judge Looks To Rebellion

Innovators Advocate

Change At Davidson

Smail audiences were one
of the -hallmarks of
-the symposium on Current
Trends in American Educa-
tion sponsored last week by
the SGA, the YMCA and the
Free University.

But there was no scarcity
of ideas as the speakers

left behind “them a wealth
of suggestions for the radi-
cal change and» dramatic

improvement of Davidson's
academic system.

First to speak was John
Holt, currently a consult-
ant with the Fayerweather
Street School in Cambridge,
‘Massachusetts, Having been
called by Time Magazine
American education's

“damning
Holt rapidly set an

one of
most critics,”

icono

clastic mood for the~ rest
of the symposium.

Holt began by asserting
that the American system's
tendency to grade and class-
ify the students is complete

aim of
students. The
of learning become

ly divergent with the
educating the
priorities
with the

confused priorities

of achieving graded success.

Another problem
with our educational — sy-
stem, Holt said, is that it
trains our students to do
something often before they
know what they want to do.
Instead we should stop look-
ing upon learning as a sort
of material exchange (e.g.,
learning for dollars) and
start seeing it as a lifetime
endeavor not linked to any
formal institution.

Dr. Edgar Whan followed
on Tuesday night with sug-
gestions he felt were of
specific value. for Davidsen;
Most of them were taken

Led By Nonviolent Youth

| A REVIEW
1“ By STEVE CROSS
COPY EDITOR

My first reaction after
reading Associate Justice
William O. Douglas's con-
troversial new book ‘Point
of Rebellion” is one of mild
disgust at the faction in, the
House of Representatives
headed. by Rep. Gerald
Ford (R-Mich.) which wants
to have him impeached.

The charge is that ‘Point
of Rebellion’ advocates re-
volution. It certainly does,
but not revolution in any
form that the Weathermen
would recognize. There is
not one word in the book
which condones violence as
a tactic of revolution in
America.

True, Justice Douglas does
quote Dom Helder Camara,
Arch-bishop of Recife in
Brazil, as saying, “I respect
the option of violence” as a
method of throwing out the
landed aristocrats of Brazil.

But can an American
judge be impeached for en-
couraging a revolution in
another country? If so, I
Would like to see the Taw.

The revolution which Jus
tice Douglas advocates is
neither violent nor illegal.
He says flatky that ‘‘viol-
ence isnot protected by the
Constitution,"’ but that to
many young people it looks
“inviting, and seems to the
discontended to be the only
effective method of pro-
test.”

Douglas documents in con-
siderable detail the list of
the ills which have plagued
the people of this country.
Among these are pollution,
the entrenched vested  in-
fterests of the military ma-
chine, the meddiesome ques-
tionaires which applicants
for jobs must fill out, and
the unresponsiveness of -re-
gulatory agencies entrusted
with our natural resources.

For Douglas, these are all
areas where revolutionary,
changes need to be made.

“Douglas looks upon™ youth

-and Tuesday.

despoiling the earth and fill-
ing people with goodies
merely to make money.

“The, search of the youth
today is for ways and means
to make the machine—and:
the vast bureaucracy of the
corporation sfate and of the
government that runs that
machine the servant of
man.

“That is the
that is coming."

Buf since people today
still ““‘hold the residual pow-
ers of government,” Doug-
las feels that another viol-
ent rebellion is unnecessary.
He hopes for ‘‘an explosive

revolution

political regeneration’  in-
stead. Whether an armed
revolution will break out

“depends on how wise the
Establishment is.” J
This book is not without
its faults. Much of the sta+
tistical data which Douglas
cites in his catalogue of ills
is familiar, but some of it
is not, and some items, like
“For the _ poor, interest
rates have been known to
rise to 1000 per cent a
year,’ need footnoting.

There are also some
patches of flabby prose that
try the reader’s patience
and waste Douglas’ words.
All too often Douglas, after
stating the problem in de-
tail, asks a rhetorical ques-
tion to which the answer is
obvious, and then answers
it for us anyway.

He hopes for a_ peaceful

Drive For Blood

The second semiannual
Davidson Community Blood

day and Tuesday. All blood

According to Sam Darby,
the faculty and administra-
tion of the college commun-

lies receive free blood when

strict constitutionist inter-
yretation of the Bill of

crime.

The impeachment move-
ment against Judge Douglas
is unlikely to get anywhere
The 51 senators who voted
against Carswell are unlike-
ly to vote for Douglas’s im-

peachment.
But any self-seeking “Es
tablishment’’ which would

attempt to remove-him from
court for his political views
will only succeed in vindicat-
ing the charges Douglas
makes in ‘Point of Rebel
lion,”’ and in bringing civil
insurrection one step closer.

Soites college and advanc-
ed study programs at Ohio
University.

Whan’s main emphasis
was on positive programs
for the student. In keeping
with this positive attitude
Whan described a system
for the Ohio freshmen which
drops “‘D" and ‘‘F" grades

from. the transcripts. Im-
mediately, Whan asserted,
transcripts become less of

a hierarchy of struggle and
more of a record of achieve-
ment.

This. same emphasis on
what the individual can
achieve was found through-
out Whan's ideas, The gol-
leges, he said, have _ be-
come too much like farm
clubs for the big leagues,
i.e., businesses and gradu-

ate schools, They should in-

“stead give real personal op
portunities for

advancement
in learning to those
ful people” want it,
And in that group he’ hop-
ed he could place
of the
body.
Améng specific programs
Whan listed work-study pro-
grams and the populariza
tion of exchanges with large
universities. Of particular
interest were the werk pro-
grams-in- Which--Whan_ sug-
gested that the institutions
give breaks to the students
doing socially useful work.
He also recommended a
plan in which the students

“beauti

pick one Wednesday a month

on which they discuss topics
of interest with their pro-
fessors., Similarly students
could elect a number of fac-
ulty every year who would
be allowed an open course
€ach term in which they
could teach anything they
wanted.

In both of these plans it
is hoped that the
picked by the students and
faculty would be ones out-
side the professor's major
field of learning so that he
and the students could learn

topies

the material together. Such
a situation would ,place
much greater emphasis on
student initiative’ than at
present. ; i

,Whan also mentioned the
Cutler program at Ohio

which did not hase entrance
requirements on any grades.
In it a person was free from
ail graduation requirements
but the one he set for him-
self.
Whan's emphasis on a!
proposals is that
quire little curricular up
heaval and very little money
to implement. Administra-
tors are denied a_ budget
cop-out when considering
the programs. The changes
can be made within the sy-

they re

stem, and dramatically em-
phasize the role of the
teacher as a resource for
the student and the role of
the student as a person who
is really trying to learn.

The third speaker was Dr. ©

William C. Archie, Direc-
tor of the Mary Reynolds
Babcock Foufdation, who
again turned to student-fac-
ulty-administration hangups.
He reemphasized the role of
the student as one trying to
learn, the sole purpose of
the college being to help
him in that task.

Closing the program was
Michael Vozick, a. Dwight
Hall Fellow at Yale and a

. member of Transition AsSo-

ciates, a learning collabor-
ative. Vozick’s talk was an
attempt to create in his dis-
cussion group. a sense of
community. . This sense is,
according to Vozick, ‘vital to
real educational dialogue. It
is an attitude he wanted the
members of his discussion
with them to the
rest of Davidson.

Librarian Retires
After Ten Years

Miss Carrie Brittain, Cir-
culation Librarian, has de-
cided to retire, because,
“There are so many things
I would like to do now that
the time has come.”

Miss Brittain observed
that ‘‘the library has grown
so much since I came here;
just the periodical circula-
tion has grown from 249 sub-
scriptions to over 1500."
This is only one of many
areas of improvement Miss
Brittain has seen.

She has enjoyed her ten-
ure at the college library
because: “the young men
here are so alive and full of
varied interests. Working in
the library at Davidson has
also. been rewarding  be-
causes of my meeting all
those fine young men."

A native © of
North Carolina, she received
her A.B. degree in English
and History at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina. She
then attended the Presby-
te School of “Religious
EF? cation in Richmond for

Asheboro,

s

a time.

She received her B.S. de-
gree in Library Science
from the University of North
Carolina, and her M.A, in
English from West Virginia
University, She also studied
for a time at Columbia Uni-

versity.

assignment as a_ librarian

was at Davis and Elkin Col-
lege in West Virginia; she
served from 1942 to 1959,
and came to Davidson in
1960.

She has served as Treasur-
er of the West Virginia Li-
brary Association, and as
Secretary of the Association
of Librarians in Presby-
terian Colleges and Semi-
naries.

She is also in the activi
ties of the

Miss. Brittain’s favorite
quotation is from_ the
psalms: “This is the day

She also likes what West

Miss Brittain is active in

“There could be nothing

The dialect writings about
stereotypes led to a ‘‘folksy
skepticism” in black minds,
Rubin said, and it could not
touch the “biting cynicism”
appropriate to political be-
trayal and the bitterness of
poverty, ¢

Rubin talked primarily
about the poetry of two early
Twentieth Century blacks,
Paul Dunbar and James
Weldon Johnson.

Johnson was typical of the
poet who had to write in the
customary dialect, crooning
style.

But in Dunbar there was
a movement from dialect to
ballard and language more

dition,
