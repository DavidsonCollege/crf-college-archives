“Morning at Bellevue

_ ___He held them so gently in his hands
delicate man at his most hurt
teary eyes that look and say

please.

— All | want is my medicine,
anguished love knowing that’s not all she needs.

Shirts layered, hiding the me so openly exposed,
the bloody wounds of the mind so bare. ~
Stiffly, shuffling, shaking,
| need my pill doc, can | have it now,
in the early slate gray dawn
where street and sky emerged from one
long nighttime New York morn.

—Hey doc ttove you; you know thate you. —==——
A head hangs,
a body cuffed, slashed and thrashing,
languidly strapped
on their stretchers surrounded by police.

— Outlaw (forSamKeen)

When you came flashing into town _Forth beneath the denim coat,
Your pistols screaming with hope,
When you stormed through the
Swinging doors, swaggering to the
Counter, orange t-shirt blazing

Sore covered feet no place to go, face tight,
calmly, nervously fingers his mouth;
and what was that you said you had—

a pipeline to God.

When, with your cosmic laughter,
You placed your calloused hand
Upon the bar and shouted,

“Dionysos Rules!”

Did you really think

That, raising our bloody eyes
From tired glasses,

We would hand you

The sheriff's badge

And kneel and cry,

Did you really think, ,; We love you"? ~~ sho
