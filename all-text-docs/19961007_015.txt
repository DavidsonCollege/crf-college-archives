DAVIDSONIAN

Field Hockey splits two

The momentum from
Thursday’s 3-0 shutout of
Catawba College was not enough
to carry Davidson past Richmond
in the first home game of oes sea-
son on Sunday.

After a hard loss at Wake
Forest, the Wildcats began slowly
at Catawba. Early in the second
half, Erin Smith followed up
Chase Keith’s shot for the first
goal. Keith, hungry for a goal of
her own, stayed after her next
shot, and knocked it in on the
second try.

During a second half rally by
the Indians, Pryorcalled a timeout
to prevent panic. Soon after play
resumed, Kate Schoening scored
the third goal for the Wildcats.

Davidson met Richmond af-
ter this confidence-building win,
but Richmond was coming off a
huge win of their own. They beat
powerhouse Wake Forest several
days before.

The game began with a
struggle forclear shots. Davidson
goalkeeper Sara Gebhardt saved
ahighcross-field ball and allowed
time for her team’s offense to
answer.

Smith streaked down the side-
line as Spider defenders strained
to catch up. The Richmond goal-
keeper managed to discourage the
initial attack, and Smith passed
off to Teresa Alden. Drawing the

scrambling defense toward her,’

Alden dished the ball back to
Smith who scored.

Inthe second half, Richmond
tested the sidelines, but Mary
Dowd pushed Richmond’s fast
breaks back time after time, crip-
pling the Spider offensive po-
tency.

Richmond, however, capital-
ized on corner shots. They were
scoreless until midway through
the second half, when one of their
corners finally went in to tie the
game. .

Pryor called time-out when
her team began to show signs of

- fatigue.

“I wanted to get them to fo-
cus again because we started to
lose our poise. That’s part of the
youth of the team, something that
will get better with time,” Pryor
said. |

The contest ultimately was
decided by endurance. The deeper
Spider bench was able to hold out
longer and carried the team

through the double overtime.

“You had to play from your
heart. When there’s nothing left
in your legs, it has to come from
your heart,” said Dowd.

Pryorhad hoped thatthe grass
field would be more of an advan-
tage, since the Wildcats are ac-
customed to their natural surface.

Gebhardt said Richmond’s
corner shots balanced out any dif-
ficulty they might have had mak-
ing the transition.

The race was scored as five
dual meets, and the Davidson run-
ners went 4-1 against the other
competitors. The Wildcats downed
Vanderbilt (22-37), Radford (17-
46), Campbell (17-46), and
Winthrop (21-40). UNC-A
knocked off Davidson, 22-37, put-
ting four runners in the top five.
Josh Cookson broke up the front-
running Asheville pack to finish
third overall.

“I was happy with my perfor-
mance, but also pleased with the
times of our younger guys,”
Cookson said.

Freshmen William Isenhour
and Pat Burchett finished seventh
and ninth, respectively.

Last week the team placed
seventh out of 18 teams at the
Greensboro Invitational.

“The competition among the
top ten runners is very strong right
now,” coach Gary Andrew re-
marked. “That will only force ev-
eryone to work harder individu-
ally, and as a result the team will
improve.”

Wildcat Invitational, the only home Due toa request from another 12.

Davidson got off to a slow
start. Prop Mike Lassiter scored
the only try for the Wildcats,
barrelling through several tacklers
and hurdling over an App. St. de-
fender at the goal line. Fullback
Matt Burkhardt converted the kick
and also put a penalty kick through
the uprights later in the game, but
the Wildcats came up just short.

“Even though we lost, we
didn’t give in after they jumped
out to an early lead and we hung in
there,” said second row man Will
Baldwin.

In the unofficial B-side con-
test, Davidson gave some of its
reserves a chance to play, and they
made the most of the opportunity.

The Wildcat tries were scored
by Lassiter, wing Christian Baker,
and prop Jason Allen. Davidson
also received help from an App. St,
player who joined the Wildcats for
the scrimmage and scored a try.

“We played tough today.
We're all disappointed in the re-
sult, but this loss should fire us up
and get us ready for Duke,” said
Baker.
