rugby position: hooker in the scrum.
TAURUS:

soever for the next two weeks. Nobody in
the SGA likes you, and there’s nothing
you can do about it — blame it on Jupi-
ter. This is your week to take up clog-
ging. Yee haw.

LEO:

If the Sun were a soccer ball in you
hand, the Earth-would be a sunflower
seed 100 yards away, Pluto would be in
Statesvffie, and the nearest star would be
in Alaska. So don’t go to States-
ville . . . too. cold. Lucky dish at the
Commons: are you kidding?

VIRGO:

You’re going to have a great week
this week. Great score on_ that
test. . . fantastic grade on __ that
paper... good times aplenty this
weekend. Stay out late and write lots of
checks. Your lucky amount? $108.52.

to get a tan. Skip town, leave no forward-
ing address, and changé your sign. Look
out for that stuff on the sidewalk and
don’t forget to stop and smell the roses.
Whoever dies with the best tan, wins.
SCORPIO:

Your flickerball team cannot lase.
Take on everyone . . ..simultaneously.
Work hard, think big. (Heck, give

Donald Trump a call!) Wear a little .

watch for uneven wear on that left front
tire.

SAGITTARIUS:

. It’s time you came to grips with the
fact that he’s just not interested. You
missed your chance during the Autumnal
Equinox. Take heart, though — the tea
leaves may say no no, but the cosmic cof-
fee grinds say this is the week.
CAPRICORN:

the pendulum of romance swings your
way. Pursue the seemingly impossible!
Ask her back to your room for a sparkling
non-alcoholic beverage — because,

quite frankly, that I.D. will never work.
Your lucky dorm: Cannon.

AQUARIUS:

It’s International Week, and The Man
in the Moon insists you participate! Set
your watch to Siberian time, break out
the old Kimono, and learn the Swahili
for, “What’s -your sign?” Your lucky
tape: Hampton, ‘85 (Wednesday).

PISCES:

Eclipse! Today! Invest your financial
holdings accordingly, and it could mean
big dividends and a house on Easy
Street!! Best bet? The “I Survived The
Davidson Eclipse” T-shirt market. Clas-
