RELIGION BROUGHT George and Monrovia Goudy to town
almost ten years ago. Religion, coupled with a strong love of Da-
vidson students, still keeps them active today. Ever bored?
‘Heavens No!,’.they insist.

Center for elderly opens
at local railroad depot

In a town saturated with
programs for young people, a
group of concerned citizens
have finally decided to pay
attention to the needs of the
retired. The Davidson Com-
munity Cooperative Services,
Inc., was recently formed to
provide services for those over
60.

Local residents have formed
the Davidson Community Co-
operative Services, Inc., an
agency designed to promote
the mobilization and integra-
tion of resources to people over
60 in Davidson.

Directed by Brigid~Q’Con-
nor, a gerontologist from
Charlotte, the organization
provides two primary types of
services to the elderly: refer-
rals to available services, and
a Senior Center located at the
Depot.

O’Connor describes the pro-
ject as ‘‘basically a community
project to meet some needs
that (the founders) felt older
people in Davidson had.’’ The
Mecklenburg County Council
on Aging can fill most of these
needs, but because the Council
has over 42,000 members and
Davidson is so far from Char-
lotte, Davidson’s citizens are
not receiving adequate ser-
vices, she said.

The program proposal, writ-
ten in April 1977, describes
the needs of the older citizens
in the town “living indepen-
dently on modest incomes who
want to remain in their own
homes.”’

An information and referral
service is needed to inform the
elderly of the publically-fund-
ed programs in Mecklenburg
County, O’Connor said. At
present, transportation to gro-
cery stores, physicians, and
the public programs are non-
existent in Davidson.

Home-health care is avail-
able now only through a limi-
ted number of the County
Health Department home
health nurses who must be
secured through a physician.
Even when an elderly person
has a home health nurse, per-
sonal health care such as
baths, shaves, and hair cuts
are not available.

Along with health care, no
Department of Social Services
Chore Services are available to
invalids because of the com-
munity’s distance from Char-
lotte, O’Connor explained.

Reassuring phone calls and
social contact through either

group meetings or visitations _
are needed to counteract the?

loneliness caused. by little or
no mobility.

Every morning when the weather’s nice,
an old snow-haired man and his small
smiling wife park their car behind Cunning-
ham Fine Arts Building and amble down
Dormitory Row. Whenever given a chance,
they stop and talk to students.

Green sunglasses are clipped onto the
man’s hornrims, making his broad face
seem very pale. His shirt is dull-colored and
his pants are very large and baggy. The
woman's dress is very bright. They are
holding hands.

When they reach Sentelle, George and
Monrovia Goudy pivot and walk across to
the library. Then they stroll onto the Union
steps. They part, she sitting on one of the
new benches outside and he plodding
assuredly up to the Union desk to check on
college announcements.

Like many other retired couples in
Davidson, the Goudy’s look to the college
as a source of entertainment and vitality.
They have lived in this community for
almost ten years, each year relying more
heavily on student contacts. ‘‘It is the
central activity of our lives—absolutely,”
proclaimed Mrs. Goudy.

Besides taking their morning walk, they
regularly attend Fine Film showings in
Love Auditorium. They come to hear
visiting speakers and student debates. The
haven't missed one Sunday night Davidson
Christian Fellowship meeting since they
can remember. _

‘‘The students, the things that go on
there, the social and cultural activities—it’s
just wonderful. It’s stimulating to live here,
to live near a college,”’ said Mrs. Goudy.
She added in a whisper-like sigh, ‘‘Up on
campus is so lovely.’

If anything keeps the couple from
becoming even more active in the college, it
is not their age and infirmity—they have
even audited college courses on occasion—
but uncontrollable outside factors. Like
nightfall.

“We don't like to drive at night. So there
is a problem in going to activities then. But
generally if something starts before dark we
can manage,”’ explained Mr. Goudy.

He likes the friendliness of Davidson
students.

“This business of friendly greetings. It
does an awful lot. To my mind it is more a
mark of Davidson than anything else I can
think of. Everybody speaks to everybody,”
said Mr. Goudy.

His wife’s eyes flared up in quick
disagreement. “‘The freshmen are cold as
Sam Hill right now,’’ Mrs. Goudy ejected.

“They just don’t speak.”

“Oh, the freshmen are always like that,”
he countered. ‘‘They have to learn.”’

But the couple agreed that no one has
ever actually been rude to them. And if
most fall-term freshmen aren’t in the habit
of speaking to the Goudy’s, they are in no
way guilty of not speaking to freshmen.

Each year they make it a habit to ask for
a freshman handbook. Every time they can
get a freshman to talk to them, they go
home and check off his name in the booklet
and make a notation of the date. Then they
try to learn names.

The Goudy’s don't consider the time they
spend on campus as the idle distraction .of
two old people bored by too much
television. Mr. Goudy frankly considers it a
ministry.

“] was a materialistic atheist until I met
C.S. Lewis’ books in defense of Christian-
ity. At the time I was a traffic engineer
working for ATT in New York City. I was .
commuting every morning from New
Jersey.

‘‘Tonly hada few years left with the
company before retirement, so we thought
it would be practical to wait until then
before going out to witness. We think the
Lord sent us here to Davidson,’’ he
recounted.

In 1968, the Goudy’s came to Davidson
on an invitation from a Charlotte minister
to operate a religious bookstore here. They
ran the bookstore for a year and a half and
then began looking for more intimate ways
to present their beliefs to students.

“T looked around for things I could do to
give a witness of some sort. We tried to
branch out on our own and started making
contacts with students,’’ he said.

The couple began to attend Bible Classes
long before DCF was ever formed. They
invited students over to their house for
supper. They tried to matter.

“We had a job of our own to do here so we
stayed on,’’ said Mr. Goudy with a
determined look in his eyes. The Goudy’s
said they were sympathetic with the
probicms other people their age around the
nation are having, but because of their
“job” they deny ever having shared those
problems. They aren't much for self-pity.

They said they were never bored. ‘‘No
we're not bored. Heavens, no. We never
have time to be bored.”

Their love for each other and for their

young campus friends have kept the
Goudy's going.
