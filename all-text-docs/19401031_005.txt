Plans Made

Plans are incomplete as yet, but
a special block of seats in the sta-
dium is to be reserved for all mem-
bers of the team who are present.
Harlee Branch, president of the
Alumni Association, will preside at
the luncheon and provide suitable
recognition for the squad. A spe-
cial photographic layout with indi-
vidual pictures of each man _ will
appear in the Charlotte Observer,
and each player will be given a
copy of this picture.

Coach Floyd Simmons, one of the
number expected for the reunion,
was instrumental in the founding
of the “D” Club, active campus or-
ganization today.

Hello. Davidson

By SAM B. ANDERSON,
Sports Editor, Centre College Cento

There is much more truth than poetry in the saying that a
prophet is not without honor except in his own country. Here
am writing a column for The Davidsonian when I can’t
even get a column in my own paper. Consider this, dear reader,
when you scan the following feeble effort of your most humble

jservant.

To you we wish the best of luck’ Saturday when you
celebrate Homecoming. That is, we wish you luck insofar
as it doesn’t result in bad luck for Old Centre.

To get around to football, which T imagine.
pected topic, let’s first consider Centre’s record
season,

Lose Opener

Our first game was with Boston College in Boston on Sep-
tember 21, Centre came out on the tail end of the ball game,
having been smothered under a 40-0 score. Boston went on to
conquer highly touted Tulane the next week, so we didn’t feel
so badly about our previous humiliation.

The next week the Praying Golonels again journeyed
out of town. This time they invaded the deep South to
meet the Choctaws of Mississippi College in Clinton, Mis-
sissippi. The Colonels again came out on the short end of
another score. This time the Chocs whipped us 20-13.

Centre’s first victory was at the expense of Hanover Col-
