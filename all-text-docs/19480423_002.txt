Introducin...

For the benefit of those students who
may not have had the pleasure, I'll take
this final epportunity to present to the stu-
dent body the men who have been chosen,
both by ballot and appointment, to serve on

the® Editorial Staff of THE DAVID-
SONTAN for the 1948-49 school year.
MAG HART
Editor in Chief

To introduce Mac to the student body at
this time is quite unnecessary. Lastaveek at
the polls that group decided that he was to
direct the preparation and publeation of
the paper next year. In this capacity he will
determine the overall policies of THE
DAYIDSONIAN, advised by the staff mem-
bers, Prof., Lilly, and the readers, He is
certainly well qualified for the post, having
served on the Sports Staff for two years;
this session acting as Sports Editor, in
which capacity he has gained a great deal
of experience both as a writer and a make-
up man. The student body is to be con-
gratulated for selecting a man of Mac’s
‘ability and character and we can rest _as-
sured that he will fulfill his duties well.

JACK HAZARD
Sports Editor

Jack has also been one of the chief con-
tributors to the sports page since he be-
came a member of the staff last year. He
has demonstrated his ability as,a writer in
the. past, and should continue to do so
through the medium of ‘‘Cat Tales.’’ The

Sports Editor has a somewhat unique posi- -

tion on; the staff in that he is the editor of
his own page, responsible for the actual
makeup as well as for the content of the
articles, Jack has assisted his new boss in
such work frequently and is well qualified
to carry on in his stead. Last, but not least,
by any means, your new sports editor has a
real working knowledge of sports, and with
the help of-his new crew of reporters will
give you complete coverage of the Wildcats
throughout the coming year.

DOUG HIxX
Managing Editor

Some of the menibers of the staff who
do a great deal of the work de so behind
, the scenes and as a_ result receive

little credit for their efforts, Doug is a good
example of exactly that. Although his name
appears in the. masthead, he hasn't gotten
many bylines nor much credit because his
time has been. spent not in writing
but in making up headlines and preparing
the sports page layouts. Mae has frequently
seen the type of job that Doug ean do, and
for that reasom he picked him to serve as
one of the four Managing Editors, In this
capacity he'll advise the new editor-in-chief
and help to prepare the paper each week.
Ile is, in short, typical of the able men who

will fill the key posts on the staff.

BOB HOLLISTER

Managing Editor

One of the ‘idea men”?
porting staff, Bob has received a well-de-
to the ranks of Man-
aging Editor. In addition to his weekly con-
tributions to the paper, in the form of news

on this year’s re-

’

served *‘promotion’

articles, or in his specialty, humorous fea-
ture stories, Bob masterminded the Feature
Contest which THE DAVIDSONTAN carried
on this semester, collecting the entries and
drawing up the rules for the contestants,
as well as arranging for the contribution and
the payment of the prize money,

DICK MORGAN

Managing Editor
Dick is another reporter who saw much
the’
1947-48 school year, Althotieh his primary

service on Mae’s sports staff during
job was to cover athletic events.and_to write
them up, he also did sgme makeup and liy-
out This overall] of the
ways in which it is done plus his talent as a

work. knowledyve
writer, makes Dick a weleomed addition to
the official family,

LONNIE) TURNIPSEED
Managing Editor

In the person of Mr, Turnipseed we have
yet another “unsung hero.’’ Lonnie has con-
tributed at least one news article each week
since last September, and in addition has
done many odd jobs when the chips were
down, This training as a jack of all trades,
so to speak, should stand him in good stead
prove to from Mae’s
point of view in the months to come, And
on top of all this he ean, in addition, wield a

and be a real asset

| Dear Editor:

Plans for September Rush Week
ire already under way in the fra-
ternities. Having talked to a num-
ber of students about the present
rushing system, I wish to express
the need of a change.

Most freshmen remember the be-
wilderment which attended their
first acquaintance with fraternities
at the beginning of the first semes-
ter, At

is at a disadvantage only slightly
less than that of the rushee:
If a hundred different men
visit a house for several hours
only, fraternity members are doing
well to recollect half the hundred

My general suggestion for solv-

ing this problem is that rush sea-

the student body and your new Editor in
Chief have chosen well, All of the new edi-
tors have worked hard and long this year,

vote their time and energy unselfishly in
1948-49, Again, T would like to thank these
men and all other staff members for their
wholehearted cooperation and support, Tam
confident that those who remain on the staff
will do the same for Mae. °

Campus Club Issue...

As the most
noticed, the fifth page of this issue of THE
DAVIDSONIAN has been devoted
entirely to the Campus Club, This was done
partly because the group requested that they
be allowed to make a report to the student
body, and partly because we, the staff meém-
bers, believe that this organization deserves
a great deal of credit for its contributions
to campus life. The Campus Club, which was
founded this fall by a number of far-sighted
faculty and student leaders, has proven to
be just ‘‘what the doctor
Through the medium of this organization

PROFESSORS CAN BE

Mutual understanding between
professors and students is reputed
to be one of Davidson's most out-
Standing features. This commenda-
bie quality is somewhat deceiving,
however, since many men are not

a happy medium in relationships
with professors. Getting to know
one’s professors personally can be
in invaluable aid in understanding
them in the classroom, This pre-
ents a problem since one is likely
to be pointed out as being an “ap-
ple-polisher” or an “eager beaver.”

Almost any ©Sunday night, a
eroup of students may be seen
tanding out in front of Chambers
Building, discussing possible pro-
fessors to visit. Usually the con-

versation goes something like this:
‘Aw, why’ go see that old fuddy-

tude to take! Just because a pro-

It all began two years ago when
I was a freshman ‘in Smythingly

restrictions on the activity of the

Then it happened. One drears

The night came, cold and som
ber, with no moon or stars and a
fine mist falling. Some of us sat
huddled together in a miserable
group awaiting our individual trials
which were to take place in thi
inner chamber. We watched the
door in dreading expectation anil
awe,

Then a voice issued forth from
this inner chamber calling me by
name, [It sounded as if it came from
the nether regions arid I thought it
was the call of doom beckoning me
on to destruction. I arose and
walked toward the door which led
to my deadly fate.

from the comnianding voice. And
as I did so a phosphorencent light
from the ceiling began to blow and
light up the scene. I looked up at

“Your name!” demanded — the

scribe gruffly.

“Robert Lee Ulysses Grant Hari-

“Say ‘sir’ when addressing your
superiors!” the chief justice ordere:
in a most threatening and severe
tone.

“Y-y-es- sir!” was my frightened
reply. A low heart rending groan
floated in from another chamber
and a violent shiver shook
whole body.

“You are accused of lynching an
upperclassman and of beit.g dis-
respectful to some others, of not
wearing your cap, and of not wash-
ing a sophomore’s feet when asked
to do so, as well as a number of

turned paler and paler. My knees
