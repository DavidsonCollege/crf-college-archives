Students make their mark on construc

Press RELEASE

Students and Faculty in the music depart-
ment traded in their instruments and
songbooks for rollers and paintbrushes on
Oct. 18, to make their mark on the construc-
tion fence surrounding what will soon be-
come the department’s new home.

The Grey Building, whichhas served asthe .
college library and more recently as the col-
lege union, is currently undergoing remodel-
ing in preparation for another incarnation as
the music program’s main facility.

Incelebration of the building project, mem-
bers of the music faculty came up with the
idea of painting a mural on the north wall of
the construction fence to relate it to the mean-
ing of the building which it surrounds. Asso-
ciate Professor Jennifer Stasack came up
with a design for the mural that would allow
for individual creativity within a unified pat-
tern. ,

Once the pattern and the background col-
ors were in place, student and faculty musi-
cians added their own personal touches, rang-
ing from pictures of instruments and favorite
pieces of music, to portraits of composers and
representations of what each muralist en-
joyed about music.

Students paint the fence
surounding the Grey
Building, which is
currently being renovated
to serve as the school’s
music building.
