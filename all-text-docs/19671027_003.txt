SSOC Continues

Peace Activities

By JOHN PANCAKE
Staff Writer
The Davidson chapter of
the Southern Student Organiz-
ing Committee (SSOC) is do-
ing just what its name im-
plies.

Leonda
Will Sing
At The ‘d’

Folk singing, light and
color will highlight the Col-
lege Union’s first Hungry d
coffee house of the year.

The coffee house, which
will run Tuesday through Sat-
urday evening, will feature
Leonda, a part-Cherokee folk
singer. She will present two
shows nightly, at 8 and 9:30,
except on Friday, when she
will perform after the Artist
Series production.

Leonda has appeared re-
cently at the Newport. R. I.
and Philadelphia, Pa.. folk
festivals. This past summer.
she toured Poland on request
of the Department of State.
The native North Carolinian
accompanies herself on gui-
tar.

In addition to Leonda, the
Union plans to show films,
described by Union vice presi-
dent Ed Embree as “campy.”
The Union will serve coffee.
tea and delicatessen items.
Doors open at 7:30 each eve-
ning. Waitresses will serve
during the last three eve-
nings.

Admission for the shows is
$1. Reservations can be made
at the Union desk. ;

The chapter has organized
student participation—in. the
recent march in Washington,
D. C., in conferences on the
war in Vietnam and on the
problems of the Southern city
and in a peace vigil.

Activities planned by the
chapter for the future are
programs in which speakers
will present views on con-
scientious objection to the
draft, draft resistance and
community organizing tech-
niques.

The Davidson chapter was
organized to aid union or-
ganizing activity in the state
last spring. but the group has
been forced to shift its em-
phasis this year because there
has been little union organ-
izing in the state this fall.
Geoff Seamans, president of
the group. said that this has
resulted in fewer activities by
the chapter than had been
anticipated last spring.

Seamans said “SSOC is not
a political organization and
does not, as an organization.
take part in electoral cam-
paigns.”

“Therefore, on the campus,
our activities consist mainly
of providing information and
providing an ~ organization
through which the individual
member mav take action. The
main benefit thus far has
been to the individual mem-
ber.’ he said.

Cary White, senior SSOC
member said. “Our activities
haven't been as numerous
this year as we had planned,
but with increased member-
ship and better organization,
we hope to accomplish much
more in the future.”

Brinkley Defines Freedom,
Other Needs Of Students

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

“No college or university
which is fulfilling its func-
tion can be unconcerned with
its students’ off-campus ac-
tivities." Dr. Alan B. Brink-
ley said.

Brinkley, associate profes-
sor of philosophy. entitled his
address “You've Been Had.
Man, If You Signed Away
Your Freedom When You
Filled Out the Application.”

He was the first in a series
of lecturers sponsored by
Sigma Alpha Epsilon in its
program, Blow-Up °67.

In his address, Brinkley
compared the closed society
of & college or university
with a world culture. He said
that the educational society

is a miniature of the world‘

society with the same need
for individual rights and free-
dom.

Brinkley said that students
need the freedom to explore.
to work out an ethical stand-
ard instead of passively ac-
cepting the moral standard
of a society which is largely
unconscious.

Students need to do this
in order to prevent a nuclear
war and create a world cul-
ture. ‘‘We don't need ideals
to die for, we need values to
live for,”’ he said.

The Berkeley riots occur-
red because the students
there felt that the education-
al system was designed to
create passive. dependent
students. They were not en-
couraged to find reality for
themselves but were forced
to accept the professors
view of reality.

Brinkley said that the func-
tion of education is to pro-
duce leaders who will force

DR. ALAN BRINKLEY
. - College like volcano.”

“oe

society-as.it-is to confront
society-as-it-should be. The
educational process must
provide students with stam-
ina so that they will not be
overwhelmed by society.

“A liberal education should
be a liberating education.”
Brinkley said. The college
should be trying to make the
students independent of the
institution, since a dependent
Student tends to accept the
status quo.

The student needs to have
the time to consider alterna-
tives so that he can formv-
late the values which he will
live by. These values can
then be integrated to form a
world view which will deter-
mine the student's future ac-
tions when he attempts to
change society.

The college community
should be a place for explora-
tion and experimentation of
ideas. ‘‘A college should be
more like a voleano than a
placid goldfish pond."’ Brink-
ley said.

Sacred Music

To Be Featured

The Davidson College Music
Department has announced
its plans for the eighth an-
nual Convocation of Sacred
Music, to be held Nov. 17 and
18.

The convocation seeks to
provide a colloquy for edu-
eators, church musicians,
clergy and laity interested in
a better understanding and
appraisal of the importance
of sacred music.

Keynote speaker for the
convocation will be Alec Wy-
ton, a composer of hymns
and past president of the
American Guild of Organists.
He will address the gathering
on the topic. “Where is
Church Music Going?” and
will direct a workshop on new
ideas in church music.

Davidson faculty member,
Dr. Alexander J. McKelway.
will address the group on
**Modern Theology and the
Church Service.” Another
lecture. ‘‘Jazz in Worship."
will be delivered by Loonis
McGlohon, a jazz pianist and
music director of WBT Ra-
dio and Television stations in
Charlotte.

Friday evening a concert
will be held in the college
church. It will be directed by
Wyton and will feature the
combined voices of the Trin-
ity Presbyterian Church
choir, Charlotte: and Queens
College Choir; and the Da.
vidson College Male Chorus.

Tickets for the convocation
may be purchased from the
Music Department.

However, the experimental
freedom of a college may be
limited by outside pressures
if the students become too
active. It is in drawing the
line on student action that
problems occur, and it is
here that students need some
guarantee of certain rights.

Brinkley said that. the
courts have changed. their
stand. The former stand
was. that a student gave up
his constitutional rights when
he enters a private institu.
tion. There is now a move-
ment of organizations like the
National Student Association
to formulate a Student Bill of
Rights.

Brinkley emphasized that
students need certain rights
in hearings on violations of
college regulations. Such
rights as the right to face
one’s accusers. the right to
an advisor, the right to pre-
sent one's own witnesses and
to cross-examine the prosecu-
tion's witnesses and the right
to a speedy hearing need to
be guaranteed.

Also procedures on admis-
sability of evidence and pro-
cedures for lawful search
must be set up.

During the discussion that
followed, Brinkley expressed
concern that the activists are
disenchanted with the estab-
lishment. He said that he felt.
that disenchantment causes
many to give up a chance to
lead a more useful life.

He said that’ a_ student
should actively work to
change society, even though
he may be defeated in the
attempt. Violent action should
be resorted to only after all
other alternatives have been
exhausted.

Brinkley. a Blue Sky sub-
committee member, was
asked about his reaction to
the postponed implementa-
tion of the Blue Sky propos-
als.

Noting the presence of
President D. Grier Martin.
Brinkley expressed disap-
pointment but understanding
of the trustees’ action and re-
ferred the question to Martin
for further answer.

Martin explained that while
the implementation of the
program would cost initially
about $240,000 an endowment
of at Jeast six million dollars
would be necessary to sus-
tain the program.

In light of the present fi-
nancial problems of the col-
lege and the campaign in
progress to raise an addiiton-
al two million dollars for a
new library, Martin felt that
the trustees had to apply
present and expected funds
to other programs.

7 social Life, Other Issues

Confront New Committee

By JIM GILLESPIE
Staff Writer

The Faculty Student Life
Committee (SLC), establish-
ed last spring, has begun its
study of campus issues and
campus social life.

The primary purpose of the
committee is to promote the
welfare of students by exam-
ining campus issues and pro-
viding a general overview of
all campus social life.

Headed by Dean of Students
Richard C, Burts, the com-
mittee consists of six faculty
members and three students.
Faculty members on the com-
mittee are Dr. R. D. Kaylor.
Dr. J. B. Stroud. Dr. William
G. Workman. Dr. Thomas A.
Williams, Dr. A. A. Wolf and
Norman Johnson.

The student representatives
are Tom Earnhardt, Presi-
dent of the. Student Council:
Bill Andrews. senior class
representative: and “Randy
Phillips, junior class repre.
sentative.

Bill Andrews said that
though the Student Life Coni-

mittee is broader in scope
than many other committees.
it does not have any special
powers.

“We have the prerogative
to take up any subject which
might need analysis.” he
said.

Establishing the commit-
tee’s scope is now the group's
hardest problem. With many
phases of student policy cov-
ered by previously existing
committees, it is difficult to
keep from overlapping.

In fact, one of the SLC’s
most important jobs is find-
ing problems of student life
and referring them to other
faculty and Student Council
committees.

The Residence Hall Asso.
ciation is currently the com.
mittee’s most important pro
ject. Providing student gov-
ernment for the residence
halls. the association covers
not only the physical aspect
of the living quarters bul also
the social aspects.

Informally approved by the
Student Council and, faculty.

the new plan was given ten-
tative approval by the Board
of Trustees last spring. With
the stipufation ‘that all ar-
rangements remain flexible.
the SLC has full control over
this experimental project.
The members of the SLC
have also urged more student
representation on faculty
committees, especially where
there are presently vacan.

cies on the committee.

Future plans for the com-
mittee include a study of the
married student housing sit-
uation, recently investigated
by the Student Council. This
study has no definite goal but
is designed to present a clear
picture of the problem so
that the committee may de-
cide upon a future course of
action,

Decision Still Pending
On Vacation Extension

A decision on the proposed
calendar charge to extend
the Christmas vacation one
day. Jan. 2. has been tem-
porarily delayed by questions
of procedure.

The proposal. which nor-
mally would be acted on by
the faculty Academic Sched-
uling Committee. has been
passed on to Dean of the
Faculty Frontis W. Johnston.
due to a change in the status
of the scheduling committee.

The committee has assum-

ed the status of an advisory
group with the authority to
make only recommendations
to the Dean of the Faculty.

Johnston will decide wheth-
er the question will be de-
cided by the faculty Execu-
tive Committee or by another
designated committee.

The decision on procedure
will be made at an early date
with announcement of the
action taken on the calendar
change made soon after that
time.

I sang my harp on the sun's deck
Here at the water in the cool unbloesomed year,
And the light notes clung at my hair roots

Like bird cries gathering.

All the day's time leaned
Into lengthening shadove

And moments clung like fresh leaves

On water.

Wind crossed the pond
Leaving stripes and crosses

As though it rolled and cast down,

Cast down its shape for vision.

Wisteria hung for lavender
In a blossom of perfume,
And on the atone a toad
Settled in sunlight.

Is thie saturation of senses enough?
Living together between a time frame,
We creature and non-creature
And I among then.
