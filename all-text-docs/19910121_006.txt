Sensitivity Does Not Preclude Debate

We are
at war. Since
our last ar-
ticle in The

the United
States has
committed
its armed
forces to
combat
against
those of Lraq.

we should all guard against be-
coming so self-righteous in our
own positions that we actually
slip into becoming irrespon-
sible.

Disturbingly, some comments
expressed (particularly on the
walls of Chambers) have been
more destructive than construc-
tive in their insensitive language
and their misrepresentation of
opposing views.

It would behoove all of us
to articulate our views thought-
fully.

troops. Regardless of our feelings
about the rationale behind the U.S.
participation in the Gulf, it is im-
portant to remain sensitive to the
feelings and emotions of the troops
and families involved in Operation

Desert Storm.

However, sensitivity should
not stifle discussion. Differing
views should be expressed. It is
indeed positive that there have been
a diversity of heartfelt views ex-

Give War A Chance

Time To Fight, Not Gripe

Well, you’ll be happy to know
that our column is one week old,

ments like “terrible,” “in poor
taste,” and “uncollegiate”. spring

As Baghdad crumbled around
him, Hussein called Bush “that
Satan in the White House” and
said that the world’s objectives
would go “unfulfilled.” It is obvi-
ous that nothing short of ‘a com-
plete allied victory will end the
war.

This will most likely require
the use of ground forces--more of
our U.S. soldiers. Now is the time

thought. So, until that happens,
keep your opinions to yourself.

As we write this article, the
glowing reports of American suc-
cesses in Iraq and Kuwait after-
only one day are truly encourag-
ing.

It is sad that people have to die
because Saddam Hussein chose to
ignore the world’s mandate to leave
Kuwait, but the fact remains that
weare anatign at war; there will be
deaths. This brings us to the point
of this week’s article,

Many exhaustive overtures
were made from leaders through-
out the world to try to solve this

crisis peacefully. Saddam chose to

ignore them all.

It seems obvious that Hussein
will listen to nothing but force, and
now we have come to that last

point
we’re
trying to make is that the Vietnam-
era peace protesters were success-
ful only after several years, and af-
ter thecasualty totals began to affect
middle America.

Reasonable estimates suggest
that the conflict in the Gulf may
only last six months and President
Bush is committed to withdrawal
when the job is done. Six months
doesn’t seem such a long time to
wait for anew world order in which
big countries no longer feel free to
dominate and dismember their

smaller, weaker neighbors. Inother -

words, give war a chance.

Rude Notes and Random Scribblings

Is Davidson's New Mascot The
Abusive And Uncivil Hawk?

They’re back! They’re bad!
They’re writing in The
Davidsonian! They helped Helms
and hacked on Harvey. They
brought you that scathing indict-
ment of your worthless, miserable
lives and suggested that your Jagey
tainted blood be spilt on the sand
for stuff too often spilt on otters.

Yes; that’s right, it’s those fast
talking fascists, Kyle and Seth,
bringing you yet another argument
for the resurrection of Adolf Hitler
each and every week. Who said
tunnel vision was out of style
anyway?

No, no, none of that. Really,
everyone quite enjoyed your little
essay, boys; but please, do go back
to the bunker and play your Neo
Nazi Reindeer games, or whatever
itis you do when you’re not vehe-
mently supporting holocausts.

We all know that you two
would rather make love than war,
but I guess you just have to settle
for what you can get.

As I| have often stated in this
space, we live in troubled times.
Especially disturbing is the rising
tide of hackneyed metaphors like
“rising tide” in my writing.

What’s really frightening,
however, is the overwhelming
support among Davidson‘students
for the war in the Persian Gulf.

In fact, sometime in the wee
hours of January 16, some genius
put up posters outside of Cham-
bers accusing those who rally for
peace of more gravely threatening
our soldiers than” Iraqi troops.
Come again?

According to these members
of “Junior Strikebusters for the
Death Penalty, Wheel of Fortune,
Every Woman’s Rightto Keep her
Trap Shut, Really Short Hair and
Poor Education” (so that tomor-
row’slaborer’s won’ tgetany funny
ideas), peace gatherings chip away
at the morale of our soldiers, and

in battle.
Taste prohibits my use of the

desired epithet, so I shall limit
myself to associating you people
with swine.

By claiming that communally
shared wishes for peaceare treach-
erous acts, you insult not only the
individuals gathering, but also the
soldiers for whom they pray, the
concept of freedom of assembly,
and, (just to be sure I include all
those attacked by your poster)
humanity as a whole.

Sure, the people who organize
and attend peace rallies are idealis-
tic, and yes, I do have my qualms
about the aesthetic qualities of those
God awful birkenstocks, but there
is no reason for these people to be
accused of treason.

In factthese are some of Amer-
ica’s most patriotic citizens.

The United States was founded
upon the simple principle of the
right of each individual to express
a dissenting opinion.

It is the duty of Americans to
communicate discontent with their
leadership.

More importantly, the protests
are not against ihe politics behind
the military action in the gulf. They
are simply for'the preservation of
human life. Only those who pro-
mote the cause of peace truly sup-
port the military.
