A closer look at parking prices

Norfleet: “any fee is going to increase”

By KirsTEN RECKNAGEL

Even before classes began last
week, news of Davidson’s $20
vehicle registration price jump
spread quickly. However, the rea-
sons behind that fee increase re-
mained a mystery to many.

Even Campus Police and
Safety officials said they were not
informed as to why the cost of
registering one’s car on campus
shot up from $60 last year to $80
this fall.

_Vice President Business and
Finance Robert Norfleet said that
he could not immediately recall
the specific details behind the de-
cision to raise the registration fee.
The decision, he said, was part of
the overall “budgeting process
which took place a year ago.”

Norfleet did say that “‘any fee
is going to increase because casts

go up,” and that Davidson’s ve-
hicle registration fee was no ex-
ception. Because the registration
fee has not kept pace with the
gradual increase in general student
fees, and because the $60 cost was
“somewhere below half of the typi-
cal fee” at other schools in this
region, the budget planning com-
mittee targeted vehicle registra-
tion fees for increase.

“You won’t be seeing those
kind of percent increases again,”
said Norfleet, referring to this
year’s 33% hike in parking regis-
tration costs. “We’re looking at
every form of revenue outside of
tuition in order to keep [tuition]

‘costs down.”

Norfleet confirmed that the
revenue generated by the $80 fee
goes directly into a campus gen-
eral account, from which various
departments and projects are
funded.

Staff crowds out students?
Computer lab concerns |

By IAN HUMMEL

Despite positive reaction from
most students, some concern has
been raised concerning the deci-
sion to move Davidson’s Com-
puter Lab from the User Services
Building to Belk Dorm.

Some students voice concern
that the school may be beginning a
pattern of uprooting students from
buildings to make room for school
faculty.

In explanation of the move,
Lydia Lorenzin, Coordinator of
Academic Computing Facilities
and Services, said that the move
began with Computer Services em-
ployees having to leave their of-
fices in other buildings to make
room for other school faculty.

Forced to make a decision, the
school decided to move the Lab to
make room for offices in the User
Services Building.

Though it was not the deci-
sion of Computer Services to make
the move, Lorenzin has been en-
couraged by the way things have
turned out.

“We just took advantage of a
situation that turned up,” she said.
In addition to the move, the

User Services Building is in the

midst of another major change.
Construction is already underway
as workers lay the concrete foun-
dation for an addition to the rear of
the old computer center building.

According to current plans,
this addition will house a training
facility for Computer Services
staff.

Question of
the week:

What is the
Sparrow’s
Nest?

Although it is in beer-can-
throwing distance of Belk and on
the path to the Commons and the
laundry, most Davidson students
have no idea what the Sparrow’s
Nest is. A sign in the window
states that the building is cur-
rently Tony Owens’ office. But
the small brick building obviously
has a history that extends beyond
the headquarters for the Supervi-
sor of Building Services.

In the 1840s, Thomas W.
Sparrow paid Davidson College
$600 for 50 acres of land, includ-

mary and Belk Dorm. He built a
large frame house approximately
where Richardson Dorm is now,
which stood until 1960. He con-
structed a small brick building
adjacent to the house to serve as
servants’ quarters.

ing the area between the infir-

Upon moving in, Thomas
Sparrow and his wife became ac-
tively involved in the Davidson
community. In turn, Davidson
College students became actively
involved with the Sparrows be-
cause of their four charming daugh-
ters. Young men who frequently
visited the home in pursuit of the
Sparrow girls began referring to
the home as the “Sparrow’s Nest.”

In 1915, the Shoemaker sis-
ters turned the Sparrow home into
a boarding house. Because a large
number of students ate at the board-
ing house for only $18 a month,
one of the cheapest prices around,
the house became known as “the
Trough.”

The brick structure next to “the
Trough” — today’s Sparrow’s Nest
— served as a storeroom until a
missionary-minded widow took up

Ben DeLisa
residence in the little Sparrow’s
Nest and began passing out reli-
gious tracts in efforts to save sin-
ful students.

By 1961, it was a storeroom
for the laundry and needed reno-
vation. _Many.students were in
favor of placing vending ma-
chines in the building and some
thought it should be used for the
new student bookstore. In the
1970s it was turned into a secu-
rity building andremained so until
1990.

The little building known to
Davidson students as the
Sparrow’s Nest has been a home
to slaves, a missionary widow,
laundry detergent. Today is fi-
nally a home-away-from-home
for building services’ Tony
Owens.

end of the seméster.

Residential Networking Su-
pervisor John Reuning ‘95 is work-
ing with the Trellis Communica-
tions Corporation, a networking
company, on the project. Their
plans for campus residence halls
“Snclude not only data communi-
cations, but telephone and voice
mail, instructional video, cableTV,
security video, e-mail and Internet/
Ethernet services, a debit card sys-
tem, building climate control sys-
tems, access control and alarm sys-
tems,” according to an article in
the spring Davidson Journal.

The project was originally
going to be completed in phases
over the next five years. It is now
due to be completed by the Spring
of 1998, at the latest. The recent
renovations on Irwin, Knox and
Akers Residence Halls have slated
them at the top of the list of dorms
to be hooked up be the end of this

-semester. They should be ready

for student use during next term.
The other dorms will be systemati-

cally wired and set up for the

Internet access in the coming
months.

One concern raised was
whether the dorm communications
wiring would rob students of so-
cial interaction. Reuning doesn’t
think so. “I believe that this com-
munications wiring should become
a useful tool for academic assis-
tance. It should enhance, not rob
the students. Just as any other
machine or service, it is there to
make life easier,” Reuning said.

Cost for the dorm communi-
cations wiring is estimated at
“somewhere around $2 million. An
additional $235,000 will be needed
per year for the increased staff,
training, equipment and cable ser-
vice contracts,” said the Journal
article.
