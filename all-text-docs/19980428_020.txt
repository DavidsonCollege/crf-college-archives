Sloan’s Heroics Propel Cats into Postseason

By BriAN MAYERHOFER
Sports Editor

Four hours and five minutes after the game
began, Stewart Sloan ended the game with one
swing of the bat. Facing an 0-2 pitch with two outs
in the bottom of the tenth, Sloan rose to the
occasion and singled home Ben Brown and Tho-
’ mas McGintee. The two-run single ensured that

the Wildcats season would continue this weekend
in the Southern
Conference
Championship in
Charleston. The
Cats won 14-13 in
a marathon game
which never
seemed it would
end.

Sloan
was just one of
several heroes for
the Cats. Sloan
went 4 for 7 with 4 RBIs. He had two doubles to
take the team lead with thirteen. Sloan also put the
Cats up by one in the eighth with a two-out, two-
run double. Mike DeSimone, the winning pitcher,
also had four hits. He hit his ninth home run and
scored two runs. Freshman Jeremiah Parvin con-
tinued his excellent season as he hit his sixth
homer of the year, a grand slam in the third inning.
Ryan Conaster has three hits, while Kurt Davis
reached base four times with two hits and by being
hit by two pitches.

For a while it looked like that the Cats would
be staying home this weekend. The Buccaneers
jumped out to early leads of 3-0 and 4-1. In the
bottom of the third, the Cats began their first

comeback of the afternoon. Sloan, batting third in
place of Luke Goodwin, opened the inning with a
single. DeSimone followed him with a double.
Ryan Conaster loaded the bases when he walked.
Jeremiah Parvin stepped to the plate and belted a
grand slam over the fence in centerfield. The Cats
now lead 5-4. The Cats would get one more across
when Ben Brown singled home Tom McGintee
from second.

During the middle innings, the game really
got wild. ETSU scored three times in the fourth to
regain the lead 7-6. The Cats then rallied for two
in the bottom half of that inning. With the bases
loaded, ETSU starter Michael Harrell lost his
composure as he hit McGintee with a pitch to score
Conaster. Things continued to unravel for the
righty as he balked home Parvin.

The teams matched each other run for run
until the seventh. In the seventh, ETSU’s Ryan
Wagner singled to lead off the inning. He was
followed by abunt base hit by centerfielder Rodney
McLain. With one out, the big hitcameas leftfielder
Brandon Eierman hit a three-run homer off
Davidson’s Garland Yarborough. ETSU took a
11-9 lead.

Davidson had reason to worry as they entered
the bottom of the eight. While the Cats managed
to cut the lead by one in the seventh, they knew that
time was running out. Lance Torbett entered the:
game for ETSU. Torbett walked his first batter,
Tom McGintee, before settling down and getting
Ben Brown and Drew Williams out. Then on a
very close 3-2 pitch, he walked Brian Joyce. With
two outs, Sloan made himself the hero for the first
time. Sloan lofted a fly ball to rightcenter, but
none one the four Buccaneers in pursuit could
come up with it as it dropped on for adouble. Both
McGintee and Joyce scored.

The Cats were only three outs away from the

postseason. The usually reliable Mike DeSimone
was getting set to close the game, but ETSU
wouldn’t go so quietly. Things looked excellent
for the Cats as DeSimone struck out Jason Wilson
and then got Eierman to fly out to leftfield. Torbett,
the pitcher, kept things alive as he singled past a
lunging Ben Brown. Then, ina moment which left
Wildcat players and fans holding their breath,
ETSU’s Rusty Swackhammer hit a very deep shot
to leftfield. The gods were on Davidson’s side as
the ball hit the top of the fence, but managed to stay
in the park. Only one run scored and the game was
now tied at twelve.

After the Cats were held scoreless in their
half of the ninth, ETSU put the pressure on
Davidson as they went up on an RBI single by
Rodney McLain. The Cats were now three outs
away from elimination. Tom McGintee lined a
pitch to centerfield to reach first. McGintee then
advanced on a Williams sacrifice hit. After Ben
Brown walked, Brian Joyce flied out to centerfield.
Joyce’s fly was long enough to allow McGintee to .
tag up to third. With Sloan up, Brown stole
second. Sloan was down to his last strike when he
ripped a single to right-center. Brown and
McGintee both scampered home. The team
mobbed the runners at the plate, while Kurt Davis
rejoiced with Sloan at second base.

Whereas Sunday was a great day for the Cats,
Saturday was a bit ofa nightmare. Coming into the
series, Davidson only needed one victory to qualify
for Charleston. ETSU should have been a good
opponent to face. They entered the series 6-17 in
conference, a spot behind the Cats. Davidson had
reason to be confident about winning at least one
game, if not the entire series. What transpired on
Saturday made what happened on Sunday so dra-
matic. By losing twice on Saturday, Sunday’s
game acted as a play-in-game for the conference

tournament.

In the first game on Saturday, the Cats looked
strong in the early going behind starter Ryan
Stroker.. The Cats were able to hold a 3-1 lead
through five innings. Stroker was pitching well as
he had gave up only one runon six hits to this point.
Inthe sixth, designated hitter Matt Nunley doubled
a two-strike pitch down the thirdbase line. This
double came at a crucial moment as two runs
scored with two outs.

Davidson had early success at the plate as
they managed ten hits in the first six innings.
Leading the way for Davidson was Ben Brown.
Brown went 3 for 4, Jeremiah Parvin had a hit and
2 RBIs. Once ETSU starter Heath Doyle was
removed, Davidson struggled. Reliever Izzy
Olvera controlled the Cats the rest of the way. In
three and a third inning of work, Olvera yielded
only one hit. He struck out four and did not walk
anyone.

The game remained tied at three until the
ninth. With DeSimone on the mound for the Cats,
he gave up a solo home run to Rodney McLain.
The ball just cleared the rightfield fence and the
outstretched glove of Jeremiah Parvin.

The home runs kept on coming in the second
game for the Buccaneers. After the Cats jumped
out to a quick 4-0 lead, ETSU hammered Wildcat
pitching over the next six innings for thirteen runs,
They hit four home runs. Lance Torbett led they
way hitting 3 for 4 with two homers and 5 RBIs.
Sloan continued to be the bright spot for the Cats
as he hit his first home run of the year in the ninth.
It was too little to, late as the Cats fetl 13-6.

Sloan’s heroics would have to wait a day. On
Sunday, Stewart Sloan clutch hitting saved
Davidson’s season. As aresult, the Cats postseason
will begin on Thursday night at 7:30 against the
Citadel in their home stadium.

Cats Upset 49ers, |

Cooke sets record

By BriAN MAYERHOFER
Sports Editor

The baseball team took a break from the
tough Southern Conference schedule by playing
two very good opponents, the Tar Heels of Chapel
Hill and the UNCC 49ers. Davidson wasn’t ex-

pected to win ei-
ther of these
—-games, but then
something funny
happened. The
Cats played some
of their best ball
of the year to split
the two games.
While the Cats lost on Tuesday.in Chapel Hill,
they defeated crosstown rivals UNCC the follow-
ing night.

With the 6-4 win against the 49ers, coach
Dick Cooke set a record for most wins in a career.
The victory was his 155th in eight seasons. He
surpassed Tom Stevens who managed from 1957-
74.

UNCC, having their best season in years,

entered the game.-at Phillips field with a record of
30-14. The 49ers have a National Player of the
Year Award contender inrightfielder James Matan.
Still, Davidson wasn’t overmatched.

Eric Bowers started the night off well for the
Cats as he pitched two perfect innings. Unfortu-
nately, Bowers left the game early with an injury.
Fritz Porter came in relief and pitched admirably.
Porter, the eventual winner, had. one of his better
outings of the year giving-up three runs in-four
innings.

UNCC led 1-0 when Davidson came to the
plate in the fifth inning. The Cats exploded for six
runs on six hits. Freshman Mike Torres, starting
in place of Drew Williams, singled. Ben Brown
walked and Brian Joyce reached base on a bunt
base hit.

With the bases loaded, Stew Sloan hit a
sacrifice fly, scoring Torres. Brown then scored
on Paul Poplin’s wild pitch. Mike DeSimone then
homered for the eighth time this year to put the
Cats up 4-1. Two more runs followed and the Cats
held a 61 lead.
