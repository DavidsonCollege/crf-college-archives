Before becoming a band leader,
singer Ray Eberle was a featured
pertormer with the great “Glenn

by trade observers as the top band

orchestra, and was regarded

singer. When his band was organ
ized about one vear ago, Eberle
was still going’ strong as a_ solo

singer. In 1946 when the band busi-

ness, took a slight yp, the Post
Lodges famed suburban spot
in NMarchimont, No ¥ ne of
the mosp valuable locations near
Gotham, was looking for a new
band, As a result of a poll taken
among high school and college

vraduates by the owner, it was dis-

covered that the person they
wanted didn’t even have a band.
Consequently, the General Artist's

Corporation set to work forming a

Thus, formed by popnlar demand,

Eberle has risen toward

phenominal fashion. Public demand
has brought his band back to-every

spot they've played. The orchestra,

besides being featured in Columbia

Philadelphia, and is the only band
