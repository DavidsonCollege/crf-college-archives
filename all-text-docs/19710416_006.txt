Whittle Promises ‘Good’

By JIM HANNA
Copy Editor
Saturday's 13th annual Da-
vidson Relays promise to be
“one of the most interesting
meets we've ever had,” ac-
cording to meet director

Heath Whittle.

“It should be a really good
meet,”’ said Whittle. “‘There
are more teams.on an even
par with each other than ever
before;”

Kighteen schools are sched-
uled to participate in the re-
lays. .

Whittle listed West Georgia
College, Pembroke State Uni
versity, Appalachian State,
Western Carolina, and High

Point College
teams slafed to appear Sat
urday.

“We ran.Pembroke earlier
in the season, and they beat
us pretty badly,”’ said Whit-

tle.
“Offhand, I'd say it was a
toss-up between Pembroke,

Western Carolina, and West
Georgia for the meet cham-
pionship,”’ he said.

West Georgia and Western
Carolina are both former
winners of the relays.”

Davidson has won its own
meet six times, the last
championship coming in 1968.

Whittle said that an injury

Willits Leads ’Cats
With TwoHomers

By DAVE TIERNEY

It's not often one finds a
shortstop leading a team in
home runs. However, Jack
Willits has changed that.

Willits leads the squad with
two of its homers.
Those seven are seven more
‘han the team hit TAX sea
son, *

“T've

really been hitting
the ball - well,’ commented
the slim, 170-pound Willits,
“though I'd be satisfied if a
few more dropped in for
hits,"*

The small difference of one
or two hits would be enough
to propel him over the .300
mark,

However, with the team
hitting over .260, those hits
have not been missed.

Coach Tom Stevens cited
Willits as ‘‘a good all-around
player, always relaxed and
cool, and probably the fast
est man on the squad.”

“The hardest play to make
is going back deep into the
hole, so speed, range, afid:a
strong arm are quite impor-
tant,’’ Willits said. :

A shortstop, besides being
in an action position, also
has many responsibilities.

As Willits explained, some
of these are ‘calling pop-ups
on the Jeft side of the infield,
covering: second base on at-
tempted steals, taking cut-
off throws from the outfield,
and backing up many plays."

The ‘Cats are currently
leading the conference with
a 5-1 record, 11-7 overall.

“The difference this year
is desire and attitude,"’ Wil-
lits believes, as ‘the team lost
very few players last year.

Coach Stevens believes the
team will win the conference
if the ‘Cats pitching eomes
through.

The team has a very im-
portant doubleheader-at Fur-
man today,

They took a very impor-
tant doubleheader last Satur-
day over The Citadel, but
Tuesday they were defeated
by Guilford 17-13, as the
pitchers walked 10 men.

The. Guilford loss raised
the team E.R.A. almost a
full run per game to 3.00.

Wildcat pitcher Rick Pi-
pan presently has the lowest
E.R.A. in the Southern Con-
ference with 0.73.

Next Tuesday the team will
meet Guilford here and
Thursday they will travel to
Belmont Abbey.

as the ‘best -

ardson will. probably prevent
the Wildcats from picking up
their seventh title.

“Tommy pulled a muscle
Wednesday and will be out
for the season,"’ said Whittle.
“We are counting on him to
help us in three events: the
440 relay, the 880 relay, and
the sprint medley.”’

“We had a good chance be-
fore ‘Tommy hurt himself,
but now I don’t know.”

The Wildcats will still‘have
help in the field events, how-
ever, with Ray Swetenburg
and Steve Kirley expected to
lead efforts in the field.

Swetenburg, a junior, is
favored in the triple jump.
He holds the relays record of
47°8"', which he set last year.

Swetenburg will also com-
pete in the high jump.

Basketball star Steve Kir-
ley is expected to place in
both the shot-put and the dis-
cus, David Crumpler is also

Wildcat Skippers
Win First Regatta

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

Jimmy Hunter has devel-
oped a somewhat unusual
method of winning regattas.

Hunter, one of the leading
skippers for the Davidson
sailing team, burns incense
in his boat.

The smoke from the in-
cense allows him to deter-
minte wind direction in light
air.

‘Using smoke is not really
original,’’ he said, ‘‘a lot of
skippers do, but most use
cigarettes.”

‘Hunter said that incense
worked better than any oth
er method because the smoke
did not rise, but was imme
diately picked up by the
wind.

Hunter's method evidently

cus throwers.

Whittle also gave Ed Dobbs
a “good chance” to do well
in the javelin event.

Davidson will be entered in
all of the seven field events
and five of the seven sched-
uled relay events.

The field competition will
begin at 12:30 p.m. Saturday,
followed by the track events
at 2:30. The meet is sched-
uled to end about 5:00 p.m.
