College owns land considered in Charlotte plan

By NELLE MCCORKLE

- Davidson owns a minor por-
tion of: a downtown Charlotte
block which constitues part of a
two-block area on which Charter
Properties and NCNB Corp. plan
to build a $300 million office/re-
tail/arts complex, developers an-
nounced last Wednesday. -

Davidson’s land, located at
Trade and Tryon streets, belongs
to the college endowment fund as
a bequest in 1948 by E.L. Baxter
Davidson. Currently Davidson
College receives returns from sev-
eral renters of the property.

The proposed development in-
cludes a planned 50-story office
tower at Table and Tryon; a 350-
room hotel at Trade and Tryon; a

AT&T donated computers and
equipment worth $80,000 to the
Physics Department Thursday.
The gift includes five AT&T 6300
and personal computers, software
and 3132/310 multi-function pro-
cessor, installed in the basement
of the Dana Science Building.

The equipment permits study
of fast- -moving data during phys- -
ics experiments, repetition of ex-
‘periments thousands of times, and
formation of data bases containing
old and new readings.

Physics Professor Wolfgang
Christian prepared the proposal to
AT&T to request the equipment.
“This gift will introduce students
to modern professional practice in
the sciences,” Christian said.

The new computers will be at-
tached to the campus computer

“network within two years. Direc-
_tor_of Computer Services John

Casey said, “There is little doubt ++
that the Physics Department will _

show the campus what network-
ing can do.”
Past AT&T donations include .
contributions to the Dean Rusk |
Program and sponsorship of this

store; and expansion of the exist-
ing Charlotte Convention Center.
Financed by NCNB and the
real estate development firm
Charter Properties as a joint ven-
ture, the project involves David-
son as a minority participant.
Davidson can now sell its

property to the joint venture or ,

take a minority ownership posi-
tion. President John Kuykendall
said, “The issue before us is
whether and when with regard to
sale.”

According to Charter Proper-
ties President Bill White, “The
next step for Davidson is to decide
whether ‘it- wants to sell its land.
When the title is cleared, we
(Charter Properties) have the op-
tion to buy 50 percent of David-
son’s pee — an undivided 50

cleared, we’re going to buy 50
percent.

“That leaves Davidson with an
option — it can sell its onan
50 percent to us based on an ap-
praisal at the time or it can ride
with the risk and potential reward

_ of development,” White said. -
College trustees may discuss _

whether or not to sell the property
during their February meeting.
White noted that Davidson does
not need to decide its course of ac-
tion until the land title clears, ex-
pected within one year.

Asked what Davidson could
expect in possible future earnings
from the property, Kuykendall
said, “Nobody knows. We are
junior partners in this whole pro-
cess, because it involves the
whole block and an unusual com-
pinaeett of Besipsts and | private in-.

terests. I think it’s safe to say that
it will be beneficial to the college
in a way that it could never be
under the present utilization of the
property.”

Project planners include

students and alumni: former Trus-
tee Bill White "52, NCNB Corp.

_ Chairman Hugh McColl Jr., past

Parents’ Council Co-Chairman,

and Belk Stores Services Chair-

man and Trustee John Belk ’43

and President and former Trustee
- Tom Belk °46.

Asked about the number of
Davidson alumni involved in the
development, Kuykendall said,
“It never ceases’ to amaze — the
number of Davidsonians who are
involved in major decisions that

There are enough Davidsonians in
this negotiation to assure that the
college’s interest will be well
served.”

Past Business Manager Bob
Currie, who represented David-
son in negotiations on the down-
town property for over 40 years
until his June retirement, said of
the planned development, “We’re
pleased that the Davidson College
property is part of such a project

‘. and that William White of Charter
- Properties has made this project

possible — he is a loyal alumnus
and a former trustee.”

Vice President for Business
and Finance Bob Sutton, out of
town this week and unavailable
for comment, now represents the
college in its property negotia-
tions.
