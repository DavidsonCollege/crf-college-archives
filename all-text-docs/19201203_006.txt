SENIOR THESES
SUBSTITUTED FOR
MUCH DREADED ORATIONS

Wednesday, the 1st, was the last day
of grace for the learned Seniors. By
that day they must have handed in. to
the professor to whose department it
relates, the subject of an original dis-
sertation—or, to speak more plainly, the
subject of his Senior thesis.

Last year the faculty ruled that, in the
future, each candidate for the bachelor’s
degree must submit an original disser-
tation of not less than two thousand
words. The subject has to be in the hands
of the professor to whose department it
relates not later than December 1. Not
later than April 1 the thesis must be sub-
mitted typewritten and in duplicate, to
the professor. The theisis will be
graded by two professors jointly and if
unsatisfactory in any wise the writer
will be given one month in which to re-
write and resubmit it.

There are two exceptions to the gen-
eral rule: Any Senior may prepare and
deliver publicly an oration under the
general rules governing the Junior ora-
tion. Of those speaking at ‘that time
four men and an alternate will be
chosen to contest for the Faculty Se-
nior Oratorical Medal at commencement.
This oration will have to answer to all
the general: requirements of the ‘thesis.

And a bit of good news for Seniors
on the debating teams: A Senior, mem-
ber of an intercollegiate debating team,
may submit his debate in lieu of a dis-
sertation. However, the debate must be
written out in full and must conform to
the general requirements, as to length,
etc. of the dissertations.

After all these years Senior Speaking
is no more. The date of its inception has
been lost in the passing of time, but
Miss Shaw, our efficient librarian, will
investigate and report on the same in
time for inclusion in the next issue of
The Davidsonian. No more will the
world be told how to run itself by
youthful, futile orators. Praises bel

RANDOLPH-MACON DEBATE
SCHEDULED FOR
NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT

C. K. Brown and J. H. McKeithen
to Represent Davidson in Contest
to be Held at Shearer Hall.

The intercollegiate debate for the fall
term this year with Randolph-Macon
College will be held in Shearer Hall
Tuesday evening at 8 o'clock. No ad-
mission is to be charged, so it is hoped
that all the students will come and bring
their friends with them. The towns-
people are also urged to be present and
support the Davidson debaters in their
attempts.

Last year Randolph-Macon defeated
Davidson two to one in Ashland, Va.,
but this time the D. C. debaters are
making a grand attempt to make it 3 to
0 for Davidson.

Both Brown and McKeithen have been
working day and night in the prepara-
tion of their arguments. Brown also
\faced this foe before and is seeking re-
ivenge. McKeithen is making his first
debate, but from all reports it will equal
that of more experienced debaters.

Randolph-Macon has not sent in her

ways put out a good team, and a good,
clean contest is expected.

VARIED PROGRAM
HOLDS ATTENTION
OF SIGMA UPSILON

The Sigma Upsilon Fraternity met last
Wednesday, November 24 Dr. J. M.
McConnell opened the program with a
talk on “The Historical Background of
the American Short Story.” Mr. Dave
Roberts read a chapter from a continued
novel. He very ably carried the beauti-
ful heroine from the Hawaiian Isles to
the land of Japan. Mr. W. P. Cummings
submitted a tale of terror of his own
concoction, which waxed eloquent in the
extreme to his listeners. He gruesomely
told of a manacled wretch being sub-
pected to a shower bath of kerosene, and
then “lit.”. His hearers wept with com-
passion. This concluded the program.
A delightful luncheon was then served,
consisting of cake, fruit salad, hot choco-
late and cigars, About half the chapter
was absent, having left the hill for the
dolidays.

THREE MEN INITIATED BY

GAMMA SIGMA EPSILON

The trio who dangled the blue test
tubes around their necks have now left
those off. They are now full fledged
members of the Gamma Sigma Epsilon
fraternity. They were chosen two weeks
ago and initiated on Tuesday, the 23rd.
After the fireworks a feed was enjoyed
by all the members.

Since the initiation of the three new
members, Messrs. C. E. Cunningham, T.
M. Lowry, Jr., and D. W. Spencer, there
are seven student members besides Dr.
Arbuckle and Professor Thies.

Plans are being arranged to secure a
speaker along scientific lines to address
the students some time in the spring.
Other plans are being worked out to
make the chemistry course more attrac-
tive each year and increase the number
taking higher chemistry at Davidson.

WILDCAT BAND VISITS
MONROE AND RED SPRINGS

On last Wednesday morning tie Da-
vidson College Wildcat Band boarded
the train for Monroe, N. C., to give their
first concert. ‘

At about 8 o’clock in the evening, be-
ing assembled in the Court House, the
musicians were greeted by an audience
that almost filled the lower floor. Every-
thing being in readiness, Band Director
D. R. ‘Freeman tapped the music stand

with his baton and gave the signal for | @

the first note to be sounded.

After playing six numbers, Senor

White, accompanied by “Willie P.” Nes-| #

bit, sang three Spanish folk songs. This

brought a hearty applause from the au- :
dience, which was appeased only by the 2

singing of another.
The last half of the program was fea-

tured by the playing of several popular

songs and solos.

While in Monroe the boys were en-
tertained at the various homes of the

best looking girls in that part of the! &
Monroe is a good town, and as |#

state.
Houston White expressed it, all had a
“father time” while there.

Thanksgiving Day was spent at Red

Springs, where a concert was given that ;

evening at Flora Macdonald College.
That afternoon the boys were guests

of the college at a basketball game play- +

ed on Vardell field between the Blues

and Whites. ‘It was a run-away match,|#
the final score being 24 to 7 in favor of | &

the Blues. A good time in general was
enjoyed by Coxe, Dupuy, Hollingsworth
and Love plus the other members of the
band, during the entire afternoon.

Davidson College Night was celebrated
that evening in the college auditorium,
the Wildcat band taking the leading
part. The auditorium was filled with a
large and enthusiastic audience made up
of students, townspeople and Davidson
alumni from the nearby towns.

The band showed the result of care-
ful training and presented with fine ef-
fect a program of 12 numbers. The
Spanish Folk songs by Houston White
were applauded heartily. while the cor-
net solos by director Freeman won the
hearts of many. The athletic feature of
the program was the trombone solo by
“Bill” Beck, which showed his: mastery
of the slippery slide. Songs of Scotland
rendered by the whole band also stirred
the hearts of many Scotchmen present.
This was followed by the singing of O,
Davidson, which concluded the program
for the evening.

Following the concert, members of the
bend and other Davidson men present
were entertained by members of the
senior class at an informal reception
given in the college parlors.: Again, as
Houston White would express it, “a
grandfather time” was enjoyed by all at
Flora Macdonald College and Red
Springs.

“THE EGG-CRATE
WALLOP” COMING

Charles Ray in “The Egg-Crate Wal-
lop” will be here Saturday night. From
start to finish it is a “bean,” and you
cannot afford to miss it. “Battling” Ray
begins as an express agent’s helper and
ends up with the agent’s daughter and
several pockets full of money.

A packet of money is stolen, and sus-
picion falls on the agent Dave Haskett,
but Charlie skips town and lands a job
in Chicago with a noted pugilist. In the
meantime a cheap sport from the city
makes love to Charlie’s girl.* * * *

What is the use of telling you the
whole story? It will be shown at the
Gym at 6:45 and 8:00 o'clock Saturday
night. Come early to get a seat.

R. 0. T. C. NEWS.

Maj. H. R. Smalley Conducts Semi-
Annual Inspection of Davidson's
Battalion. °

The second monthly inspection of the
R. O. T. C. unit will be held Friday, De-
cember 3, at 3:30 p. m., on the athletic
field.

The drill this time will be of a some-
what different order from that seen for-
merly. A and B Companies will pitch
tents on the north side of the field and
C and D on the south side. Each com-
pany will then have a formal guard
mount and a posting of sentinels. All
the men get in their tents at taps and
the sentinels will call their rounds just
as at night. At the sound of reveille the

men will again fall in.

The competitive inspection will then
be carried through. This will be follow-
ed by a sham battle during which sev-
eral hundred rounds of blank ammuni-
tion will be fired. The battle will be
called a draw and tents will be struck.

After the tents are down and the
packs made up the battalion will then

go through a regular parade. The com-
pany «winning this contest is excused
from several drills and keen competition
has been developed among the com-
panies for first honors.

The band will be there to furnish
music and all the people in the neigh-
borhood are urged to attend-and see the
battalion in action. ,
