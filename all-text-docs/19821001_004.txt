New Police
Chief Chosen

a

By DUNCAN V. FRASER ’86

The town of Davidson has gained
Jack Warlick as the new Chief of Police.
Although Chief Warlick has only been
with the Davidson Force for 2'%
months, he looks forward to an auspi-
cious future and sees no major
changes or problems that would affect
either the town or the college. As the
Chief put it, “Davidson is a small tov"
and its crimes are more larcenies, do-
mestic calls, and minor offenses rather
than murders or other types of major
crimes.” -

Chief Warlick has quite an impres-
sive list of credentials from his past
eleven years in law enforcement.
Warlick attended Military Police
School while in the service at Ft. Gor-
don, Georgia, and served in Vietnam.
Returning to the states, he continued
his military service as an Honor Guard
at Ft. Sheridan, Illinois. Upon leaving
the service, Warlick spent one year on
the police force of Newton, N.C. and
then joined the Burke County Police
Department where he attained the rank
of Shift Commander before coming to
Davidson.

Furthermore, Warlick attended
Western Piedmont Community Col-
lege where he earned a degree in Po-
lice Science and Gardener Webb Col-
lege where he completed his Bachelor
of Social Science. Chief Warlick has
also earned the Criminal Justice Edu-
cation and Tranining Standards Com-
mission’s Certificate, the highest law
enforcement certificate in North Ca-

rolina.

Chief Warlick hopes to be able to
improve the police force as its new Po-
lice Chief. “We have enough man-
power,” he says, “and the only thing
that could be improved is the mechan-

ics” of the system. With only six to.

seven calls on an average day and a
population of about 3200 including
the college, the Chief says that the 6
full-time and 1 part-time members of
the force are more than adequate.

The Davidson campus police are a
branch of the town’s force, although
they work at the direction of the col-
lege administration rather than the
town. Warlick is aware of this unique
situation and would like to see the
town force “have a closer working re-
lationship with the campus police.”
For the most part, however, the only
issues in which the town police partic-
ipate are complaints of excessive
noise, off-campus traffic violations,
and major crimes, such as the theft of
property from Belk Dorm over this
past summer.

Chief Warlick came to Davidson
primarily for professional advance-
ment and looks forward to working
with both the town and the college.
Considering Chief Warlick’s creden-
tials and his experience in small town
law enforcement, most would agree
that Davidson has gained a new police
chief who is a credit to the law en-
forcement community.

Community

Liason Chosen

By MELISSA MCKEITHEN ’83

The SGA Campus-Community Lia-
son*Committee was established last fall
as a means of opening communications
and promoting interaction between Da-
vidson College students and members
of the Davidson Community. This fall
the CCLC will make its first appoint-
ment to a position which it has been
working on for nearly a year.

The position is a student liason posi-
tion between students of the college and
members of the town council. CCLC
members Sherburne Laughlin and Me-
lissa McKeithen have discussed this
proposal with council members individ-
ually and they have agreed to the possi-
bility of its benefits as well. The follow-
ing is the proposal which the SGA has
accepted.

“Because there are, at times, matters
before the town council which may in-
volve students of Davidson College and
because the council may at some time

need a contact among the students, the
Student Government Association Cam-
pus-Community Liason Committee
wishes to propose the establishment of a
student liason position. It is not the in-
tention of the committee to make this a
voting committee member or one who is
involved in affairs which are not of con-
cern to the students. The position should
be mutually advantageous to both stu-
dents and the town.

This position will mean:

1) Representation of Davidson Col-
lege students as concerned members of
the Davidson community in matters of
direct concern to Davidson College stu-
dents.

2)Providing council members with di-
rect and organized access to Davidson
College students thereby allowing a
clear and reliable channel of communi-
cation between the town and the stu-
dents.

3)Making other students aware of ac-
tivities, concerns, and events of the
town.

4)To serve as a specific channel for
the concerns and ideas of the student
body. This representative will refer stu-
dents to specific council members and/
or committees.

Nationwide
Campus
Population
Rises

(CPS) Defying predictions, college en-
roliment will increase as much as two
percent again this fall, thanks largely to
an influx of part-time and older stu-

. dents,*the National Center for Educa-

tion Statistics (NCES) says.
The NCES itself has been one of the
most consistent predictors of dramatic

~ decreases in College enrollments, pin-

ning its projections to the number of 18°
to-24-year-olds in the population — tra-
ditionally the prime age bracket for col-
lege enrollment.

In 1980, for instance, NCES said col-
lege enrollment would peak in 1981 at
11.7 million students, and then begin a
steady decline lasting through the
1980s. ;

But 1981 enrollment topped 12.3 mil-
lion. °

This year, NCES projects enrollment
will hit 12.5 million. The agency now
predicts enrollment will begin a slow

descent in 1984, leveling off at around
12 million by 1990.

“The college-age population did peak
in 1981, just as we predicted,” explains
Dr. Vance Grant, director of NCES’s
annual Back-to-School Forecast. “What
we weren’t counting on were so many
older students coming back to school.”

The 18-to-24-year-old group swelled
to 29.5 million people last year, but will
decline by half-million increments
roughly every two years to 25 million by
1990, Grant says.

“Ten years ago nobody would have
guessed we’d have as many older stu-
dents as we do now,” he explains. “So
while we’ll be getting fewer and fewer
full-time, traditional students, that de-
crease will be offset by the influx of
non-traditional enrollees.”

He speculates that two-year commu-
nity colleges will get most of those stu-
dents. Another recent study predicted a
four-percent population boom for two-
year schools this fall. -

The economy and the need for more
people to occupy high technology fields
are probably the two main reasons for
the increasing numbers of people re-
turning to school, Grant adds.

“T think a lot of it is job-oriented,” he
says. “Some of it may reflect the afflu-
ence in some parts of society where peo-
ple have more leisure time. And the
economy and unemployment in other
sectors of society are also factors. When
job opportunities are not too good, peo-
ple look for something that will give
them an edge.”

Arson Gang
Snuffed;
Three Arrested

By JEFF HOLLAND ’84

Mecklenburg County Police arrested
four Davidson teenagers over the sum-
mer and charged them with arson in
connection with a fire two and a half
years ago which destroyed a Cornelius
shopping center.

The police learned of the possible in-

~ volvement of the youths during an in-

vestigation of a fire at the J. King Harri-
son Warehouse in Charlotte.

The 1980 Cornelius fire destroyed a
Western Auto Store and about four oth-
er stores. At the time, County fire inves-
tigators were not sure if the fire was a re-
sult of arson, and the cause was listed as
undetermined.
