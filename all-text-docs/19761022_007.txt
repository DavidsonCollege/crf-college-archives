going on. The fun and the money
spent should be spread out over the
whole term, but I doubt if they’ll ever
do that.”’

Useful

Despite these provocative criti-
cisms of a minority, most students
agree that the concept of the big
weekend, though not ideal, does serve
several useful functions. For example,
Homecoming lures the library rats
out of E.H. Little Mausoleum. Ac-
cording to one junior, ‘“‘it’s a good
incentive to let pre-meds loosen up;
lots of people won’t party except on a
big weekend.’’ And, of course, it gives
those already so inclined the slight
excuse necessary to indulge in pagan
debauchery on a more intensive
level.” It’s a good reason to splurge,”’
stated one junior girl.

The big weekend concept also
allows the concentration of events and

ensures a good turnout. Houses,.

fraternities, and the school can sched-
ule a variety of activities and expect a
good response. Socializing, which is
often neglected at other times due to
academic obligations, hits a peak on
these extended weekends.

Pressure to date

One integral yet controversial as-
pect of big weekends which is illustra-
tive of their less than idea but
apparently beneficial nature is dating.
Those who have a negative view of big
weekend dating base their case on
arguments similar to the aforemen-
tioned criticisms ofthe artificial
formality which. allegedly pervades
the big weekend. They tend to focus
on the unnatural increase in the

pressure to date. Commented a junior
guy, ‘‘there’s a lot of social status tied
up with getting a date; girls coming
from other colleges—that’s hardly a
homecoming.’’ This anxiety over
status and pressure is reflected in the
following remark made by a freshman
girl: ‘For a girl not to have a date
puts her at about the bottom of the
barrel. Because there are so few girls,
all of them should have dates.’’ And
one sophomore girl, summing up. her
negative view of big weekend dating,
said, ‘‘it’s totally unnatural; you’re
expected to date and if you don’t
you're out of the scene.’

In many cases, students inter-
viewed did connect their high expect-
ations with the fact that they had a
date. ‘‘It’ll be great—I’ve got a date
with a football player,’’ commented
one beaming freshman. A sophomore
put it this way: ‘‘I hada good time
but it all rests on the fact that I had a
date, every single bit; there should be
more activities for non-daters.”

Strange as it may seem, the
positive view of big weekend dating
was also based on the increased
pressure to date. This view was
summed up by a freshman girl;
‘‘Homecoming helps the social scene
because it forces people to date, to get
involved socially. It’s unhealthy to
relate only on an intellectual level;
social interaction is good (and good
for you). Guys are too worried about
being turned down; the social pres-
sure of a big weekend is definitely
beneficial.’’

Escape

power of the self-fulfilling prophecy,

Earl R. MacCormac, Metaphor and
Myth in Science and Religion, Duke
Publishing Company, $7.95, 167 pp.

I find nothing more irritating than
the sight of a young student of science
striding forth from the doors of
Martin, clutching a slide rule in one
hand and a bagful of concepts in the
other, intent upon solving the prob-
lems of the world.

Professor of Philosophy Earl Mac-
Cormac’s new book, Metaphor and
Myth in Science and Religion, pro-
vides a sufficient and welcome anti-
dote to such naive behavior.

MacCormac’s thesis is that religion
is not purely subjective nor is science
purely objective. Instead he argues
that both are conceptual explanations
of human experience that necessarily
use metaphor in the acquisition and
explanation of knowledge. Both are
subject to the problems of myth.

MacCormac notes in the preface
that discarded scientific theories are
as mythical as religious stories and
fables. At one time, both were
believed to be actual accounts of
reality and both have since been
found lacking.

This is a highly important obser-
vation. MacCormac questions the
attitude adopted by many scientists
in conjunction with their philosoph-
ical cronies, the logical positivists,
that religious language and therefore
religious discourse is largely mean-
ingless while scientific language epit-
omizes meaningful communication.

By juxtaposing metaphor with
scientific and religious language,
MacCormac not only describes the
subjective deviations of both science
and religion, but also contributes
valuable insights into the nature of
the metaphor and its close relation-
ship with myth in any field of human
investigation.

In debunking the erroneous concept
of purely objective science, MacCor-
mac attempts to restore some balance
between science and religion and
argues that the limits of scientific
account and investigation should be
popularly recognized.

MacCormac’s book is divided into

metaphor in new book —

five sections. Chapters I and II
present a well-constructed and brief
history of the positivist movement
and its relationship with and effects
upon the philosophy of science,
religion and twentieth century apolo-
getics. He leads the reader through
the evolution of positivist philosophy
and the thought it has stimulated,
highlighting the contributions of
Rudolph Carnap, Thomas Kuhn, Karl
Popper, John Hick and Ludwig
Wittegenstein, among others, and
concepts such as the positivist notion
of verifiability and falsifiability.

Chapter III presents a version of
the ‘‘tension theory of metaphor’”’
whereby two usually separate con-
cepts are linked to express a new
viewpoint or idea. This thedry differs
from a standard account of metaphor
in that it views metaphor as a process
and not a static concept. The meaning
of all language which uses metaphor
is a changing and evolving phenome-
non.

The relationship between metaphor
and myth is clarified in Chapter IV by
MacCormac’s definition of myth as,
“the mistaken attribution of reality to
a diaphoric metaphor.” (A diaphoric
metaphor is one that is not commonly
used and still has the power to
express possible meanings.) This
premise leads to some remarkable
conclusions.

One of the great virtues of this
work is its intelligibility to the
layman and to the student. Although
some training in formal logic and a
familiarity with linguistic analysis
would enhance the reader’s compre-
hension, neither one is a prerequisite.

Furthermore, the reader of Thomas
Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific
Revolutions will enjoy MacCormac's
work and should discover a relation-
ship between his book and Kuhn’s.

MacCormac’s style of writing belies
the prejudice that all philosophers
who commit their thoughts to paper
subscribe to an honored tradition of
obscurantism.

This work is a tightly knit treat-
ment of a problem that its the
attention of anyone with an rest in
philosophy, science or theology. It
upholds MacCormac’s reputation as
an articulate and competent philo-
sopher.

DURING the Homecoming week-
end, some students felt the need
to seek solitude in their own
rooms.
