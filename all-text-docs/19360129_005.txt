SERMON IN TWO PARTS

Dr. Lingle Gives History and
Influence of Bible

“This history of the English
Bible and its effect on the litera-
ture and morals of the English peo-
ple” was the topic of Dr. Walter
L. Lingle’s sermon last Sunday night
at vespers.

Dr. Kenneth J. Foreman, of the
Bible Department, was in charge
of the service, aid’ Dr. C. 'M. Rich-
ards led .in prayer. The college
quartette rendered a number,

For the scripture, Dr. Lingle read
“part of II Timothy 2. taking for his
text the latter part of 11 Timothy
2:9. This verse is “Yhe word of
God is not bound.” His sermon was
divided into two parts. The first
was the htstory of the English Bi
—ble. and the second was the i

———

ence ot the Bible on Morais and
Literature. The history ofjthe Bible
began with the two versfons that

Christ used, the Old ITebrew ver-
ston and the Septuagint. Ile traced
tHe history through the work of
Jerome who made the Latin” Vul-
yate, Cacdinon. Bede, Alfred the
Great. Wycliffe. ‘Tyndale, and. fi-
nally came to the work of Cover-
dale. He pointed out that this was
the first complete version of the Bi-
‘ble, but he said that in Ins opin-
ion Coverdale did not deserve as
much credit as dwt Tyndale, as he
was not killed for his beliefs. He
then told of the Genevean edition
and the King James version.

In speaking of tha influence of
the Bible on all English titerature,
Dr. Lingle pointed out that this
Book was a picce of literature in
itselt. It influenced the work of
Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, Rus-
kin and Bunya along with many
others. He said that Lincoln prob-
ably got his oritorical talents from
the Bible as it was one of the few
books in iis home.

Dr. Lingle pointed out that the

Members Talk
__ At Eu Meeting

Literary Society’ Hears Talks
By White, Mawhinney,
Wicker, Young

The meeting of the Eumenean
literary Society which was held on
the Tuesday before examinations
icatured speeches and papers given
by members of the society.

The meeting. which was held in
the Social Center on Jan. 13, was
opened by a speech delivered by
Locke White, of the freshman class.
White spoke on “Strike-Breaking,”
devoting most of his tatk to telling
about the work of Pearl 1. Rergolf.
Bergotf has commercialized this ac-
tivity to a great extent, and in do-
ing so has received both praise and
opposition, The motto of the or-
ganization, as quoted by the speak-

“im “Kegardless of who loses in
a strike, the streak-briker always
wins.”

J. Mawhioney continued the meet-
ing by reading an original paper,
using as his topic “The Sales Tax.”
Mawhinney errumerated the advan-
tages or this legislacion, explaining
that it was based on the principles
ot Adam Smith, the great eco}
noniist:

Following this L..L. Young read
a paper on Pasadena. As described
by the critic. Daymond Turner, it
was a very “flowing and jilowery”
description of that famous  Cali-
fornia city.

Tha last item on the evening's
program was a speech by Monroc
Wicker on “Movies Ya Undia.”
Wicker explained that the Ameri-
can film has. much influence through-
out the world. citing examples to
prove the point. He said that In-
dia has many theaters in which
American films are shown.

Examinations preseated the hold-
ing of a meeting the — fallowing
week and the saciety did not asscim-
ble on Januray 27 so as not to con-
flict with, Ransom lecture.

Mid-Year Fray
Is Completed

Clouds of Despair Settle As
Reports Are Posted

The war is over, the battle din
and confusion have died dawn-and-
only a_few_faint eehas pervade_the
silence. EXAMS ARE OVER!

For the last ten days the army of
Davidson Students has been battling
valiantly in that mid-year fray, and
now that it is over, only the casual-
ties remain.

Here is Student A. This poor
unsuspecting fella forgot all about
drilling in his happy-go-lucky man-
ner, and “got shot” on the first
vatley. There he fies with three
wounds, each resembling an F.,

And there’s Student B. . He dies
wroaning at the edge of the field
bemoaning the sbots he might have
received if he hadn't been prepared.
If he does “get shot” though, you
can bet that one particular instruc-
tor will get a piece of his mind,
if any.-

Student C is in the middle of the
confusion chortling merrily at the
whole thing, despite~ the loss--of
a few spare members. He passed
anyhow, and that’s a lot! :

Now let us glance at the opposing
side. There they sit serenely, ben-
evolently, but cruelly drilling my-
riads of the “poar critters.” Some
of ‘em riddle the opposing ranks
