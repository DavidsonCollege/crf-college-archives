BEATING THE BUSHES

HOMER AND THE BOYS haven’t seen too much on
campus since November and the reason behind their ab-
sence is that they have been beating the bushes for that
rare type of high school senior — the boy who has the
grades to get in Davidson and can contribute to the foot-
ball program at Davidson.

One wonders why Davidson does not announce a rash
of signings early in December as schools of the South-
eastern Conference do. The competition between football-
oriented schools such as Georgia and Georgia Tech would
begin in junior high school if they didn’t put restrictions
on themselves. Davidson doesn’t have to worry about
that.

For a coach to announce early in the year that a boy
will attend on an athletic grant-in-aid implies that pros-
pective athletes do not adhere to normal admissions pro-
cedure. But here at Davidson, football recruiting centers
on making a boy want to go to Davidson. It doesn’t guar-
antee him admission, but only convinces him that high-
pressure recruiting and widespread publicity are not part
of the Davidson system.

COACH DAVE FAGG, known as one of the most
loyal Davidson alumni anywhere, explained that recruit-
ing starts with finding good students who have the poten-
tial of qualifying for admission to Davidson. There are
some boys who entered the football files when they were
high school freshmen. Once a prospect has been con-
tacted, it is up to him to decide whether he is interested
in proceeding to the next stage of recruiting: determining
his ability. Game films supplied by high school coaches
usually are the basis for deciding whether the football
office will ascend to the next level: a visit to Davidson.
NCAA rules allow one paid trip by a prospect to an indi-
vidual institution and most of these are made in January
and February.

One might expect something like a traternity hotbox
when a high school senior is brought here, with ‘the
coaches slobbering all over the boys, showing which
locker wili be theirs, and generally telling him that he is
sure to be All-American. But what is distinct about David-
son is that the Wildcat football players carry the ball
themselves.

“We've found that we’ve been successful with this
system,” declared Fagg. “The young men here are as
dedicated as we are. They are actually upset if they aren't
involved in the recruiting process.”

EACH PROSPECT who is brought to Davidson for a
weekend is acquainted with four basic aspects of school:
the students, the coaching staff, the physical facilities
and the faculty. Fagg noted, ‘We've never had a boy here
without having him talk to some professors and the Ad-
missions Office. Our goal is to have one Davidson man to
know any boy personally we are interested in, whether it
be a student, alumni or professor.”

Because every boy must be admitted before his schol-
arship can be awarded, if one is involved, announcements
usually don’t begin until early Spring. Just as for other
Students, an athlete does not commit himself by signing
a grant-in-aid, but he does commit himself when he signs
the National Letter of Intent which binds him to one
school. The first day this letter may be signed this year
is May 17. |

FOUR COACHES cannot cover the nation but the
small Davidson staff attempts to cover key areas. Fagg is
in charge of North and South Carolina, Bob Brown works:
in Georgia, Florida and Virginia, and Dick Short is oper-'
ating around D. C., Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York,
New Jersey and the Midwest, taking over.a departed Dick ,
Tomey’s responsibility with thus-far excellent results.

Coach Smith, who is constantly on the road, “‘tries to
have as much personal contact with every prospect both
here and at their school and home,” Fagg explained. “He

is devoting a great deal of personal time to build David-|

son.”

_ This year’s recruiting has centered around big in-
terior linemen and fast running backs. Quarterbacks are
always in demand, witnessed by the seven who played
various positions this year.

Because no names can be divulged, only numbers can
be used so far in comparing this year to last, the first full
recruiting year for the New Look. Fagg estimated about
8-10 boys “who have committed themselves pending ad-
mission.” This is approximately the same progress for a
comparable time last year, he said. Among these are two
boys from Maryland, signed by Short, who reports they
could put Davidson on the national football map.

Decisions will begin to occur more frequently in the

next few weeks. As Fagg noted, high school juniors will] .
begin to feel their importance in a few weeks because a|_

school like Davidson can get ahead by simply contacting
a boy before larger schools get the chance.

FOOTBALL AT DAVIDSON gets brighter every day
because of the dedication of those associated with it.
Hopefully football will not experience a year as disas-
trous as Lefty Driesell did when he recruited prospects
among the present college seniors. Contacts will grow

and Davidson's image, carried throughout the South and|

East by men like Homer Smith and Dave Fagg couldn’t
be in better hands.

RICHMOND

TUESDAY

By SAM BELL
Sports Writer

The off-and-on Davidson
Wildcats will try to even
their season record tomor-
row night against a power-
ful St. Joseph’s team in
Charlotte Coliseum. After
this intersectional tilt, the
‘Cats return to Southern
Conference warfare against
Richmond in Johnston Gym
Tuesday night.

The Hawks from Philadelphia
are lead by their All-America
center Cliff Anderson. Ranking
among the top five scorers in
nation, Anderson has been the
big gun in St. Joe’s fast moving
offense that has shot down such
formidable opponents as Brig-
ham Young. Georgetown and
St. Francis. They dumped Xavi-
er, 81-80, Wednesday night.

“St. Joseph has a real good
team.”’ said Coach Lefty Drie-
sell. “They have a 12-5 record
and have beaten some real good
teams. Two of their losses were
to St. John’s and Providence ‘in
very close games.”

The Hawks are not very big

as compared to most college
teams with Anderson being 6’-
5°" and both forwards only 6°4"'.
However. Assistant Coach Gale
Catlett commented. ‘Both An-
derson and Albert Grundy are
very strong and can really
jump.”

“Typical of past Jack Ramsey
teams,"’ continued Catlett, “they
press a lot and change their de-
fenses. On offense, they like to
get Anderson isolated one-on-
one. They try to compensate for
their lack of size with speed and
quickness on! both offense and
defense.”

Richmond jis probably the best
team to come to Johnston Gym
in several years. The Spiders

pose a definite threat to David-
son's %37-game winning streak
which dates back to the ‘Cats
‘loss to VMI in the 1961 1962 sea-
son.

As of last weekend, Richmond
was in third place in the con-
ference. This game is probably
the most important conference
clash the ‘Cats have left during
the final drive to the Southern
Conference tournament March
2-4,

The ‘Cats will attempt to
avenge their earlier loss this
season to the Spiders. Driesell
stated, “It will be a real tough
game. but we are really looking
forward to it.”

Splashers Remain Winless

By BOB STUBSS
Sports Writer

The winless (0-4) Wildcat mer-
men traveled to Virginia only to
receive convincing defeats from
Roanoke College and Virginia on
Jan. 13 and 14.

Roanoke had little trouble in
disposing of the outmanned
‘Cats, 63-31. In one of the few
bright spots of the meet. the 400-
yard medley relay team beat
Roanoke in 4:20.9. Steve Barden
was the leading point man for

Davidson. He was first in the

200-yard breast-stroke with a
time of 2:36.4, second in the 160-
yard individual medley and
paced the victorious 400-yard
relay team.

Roanoke swept every other
event, but the ‘Cats’ Joe Friebele
took second in the 200-yard back-
stroke and John Helm was third
in the 60-yard freestyle.

The next meet was the same

style.

_ Bobby Vagt gave the ‘Cats six
points with second-place finishes
in the 200 and 500-yard freestyle.
Friebele also had two second
places to his credit. One came
in the 200-yard individual med-
lev and the other in the 200-yard
backstroke.

“We sorely missed Eddie
Beach, who was out best man in
the butterfly and individual med-
ley. Illness prevented his mak-
ing the trip.’ said Coach Tom
Stevens, ‘‘Already we were out-
numbered and his absence didn’t
help any.”

Tigers. Stevens said. “Last year
we beat them. but because so
many boys chose not to go out
this year we will more than
likely lose again. Clemson will
have too much overall depth for

us. Right now we have six boys
in 12 events."

The ‘Cats finish out next week
in Atlanta with back-to-back
meets against powers Georgia

Richmond is led by All-Con-

and lanky 6'8°° forward Tom
Green. ‘‘Moates all but beat us
by himself.’ commented Drie-
sell. ‘We'll have to do something
to contain him.”

Catlett added, ‘‘They played
an outstanding game against us
there but it will be a different
story in Johnston Gym. We are
ready for them.”

‘Cats Drop To 8-9 Record
With Wake, WVU Losses

By YATES FAISON
Assistant Sports Editor

The rallies were either not long enough or not strong enough for the Wildcat
basketballers this week, as they succumbed to Wake Forest, 88-74, Saturday at
Greensboro and at West Virginia on Wednesday, 85-83 to go to 8-9 on the year.

Despite all that Mike O'Neill
could do, sudden scoring sprees
by both opponents doomed the
‘Cats to go under the .500 mark
and give West Virginia a clear
shot at the conference regular-

LILES PULLS DOWN FIRST-HALF REBOUND
Sub Delivers In 93-75 Romp Over Wake Frosh

Second-Half Spree Ignites
"Kitten Romp Over Wakies

GREENSBORO — Battling fans, noise and fouls alike, the freshman answer to
the new breed of Davidson hoop heroes poured on the steam during a hotly-contested
second half to wallop the Wake Forest yearlings by a 93-75 count in Greensboro Sat-

urday night.

The victory was the ‘Kittens
10th without a defeat and their
second of the season over the

Despite a serious foul situation

were relieved with 1:22 to go.

Maloy, who sat out five min-
utes of the second half due to
fouls, paced the ‘Kitten attack
with 25 points, including several
of the spectacular variety, and a
game-high 18 rebounds. Cook
and Kroll each contributed 20
points, and Jan Postma added
17,

The story of the game was
probably the ‘Kittens’ tough
shooting in the clutch along with
a stingy defense. While ripping
the cords for 58.1 per cent, the
frosh forced the Deaclets to
shoot from outside, resulting in
a 41.8 per cent mark. Maloy and
Cook disregarded their foul vul-
nerability to make successful
blocks on layup attempts.

Although the ‘Kittens were hot
on their outside shots. their pro-
ficiency did not carry over to
the charity stripe. Cook and
Postma, usually good foul shoot-
suffered especially poor
nights. Postma hit on only seven
of 11 shots, while Cook canned
only two of six.

Norwood Todmann. who raised
a lot of eyebrows in the New
York area after Lew Alcindor
left, pumped in 26 points for the
losers. Dickie Walker had 18 for
the Deaclets.,

The Wildkittens were to have

In the Deacon game the ‘Cats

The story was a little differ-

was the same. The ‘Cats jock-
eyed, with the Mountaineers for
most of the first half before
trailing, 48-40, after Ron Wil-
liams' last-second 25-footer.

O'Neill contributed 16 of his

28 points in the first half, con-.

he scored most of his 28 points

Once again the ‘Cats put on a

But the ‘Cats decided to give the
