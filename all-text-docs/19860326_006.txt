Theater for Deaf

Entertains

By ANDY BALL

If anyone shared my senti-
ments last night before the perfor-
mance of the National Theater of
the Deaf, they probably had a few
doubts in mind. First of all, they
most likely had no idea how sucha
performance would be carried
out. I fully expected a two-hour
display of expressive sign lan-
guage that would hold my atten-
tion for a short time and then bore
me to tears. I was also confused as
to how the acting company would
communicate any dialogues to the
audience. After all, what is a play
but a series of conversations be-
tween characters?

As it turned out, neither of the
two plays that were performed
needed any dialogue. Voicing ac-
tors speaking from either on or
offstage provided the voices for
not conversations, but the tesit-
monies and points of views of the
characters. The principal actors
themselves not only acted out the
parts but also expressed the narra-
tion in sign language. The created
effect was not a detraction from
but an enhancement of the
storyline.

Audience

The first play, /n A Grove, by
Ryunosuke Rkutagawa was pre-
sented as the hearing for a murder
committed in feudal Japan. The
dark and often mysterious plot led
the audience through a series of
confessions given by characters
involved in the murder (suicide’’)
of a samurai warrior. Eerie light-
ing and sound effects along with
simple props and the actors’ ex-
pressiveness heightened the inten-
sity of the story.

The second play, an adaption
of E.B. White’s (better known for
his children’s book Charlotte’ s
Web) essay Farewell, My Lovely!
was a high-spirited look at the
heyday of the Model T Ford
Complete with a full size replica
of the famous auto and the flowery
fashions of the era, Farewell, My
Lovely! was the perfect comple
ment to the shaded theme of Jn a
Grove.

I thoroughly enjoyed the
dramatic presentations of the Na
tional Theater of the Deaf. I’m
glad I didn’t let my doubts or any
one else’s keep me from this fine
performance.

Cornelius is home to many
restaurants that, while they may
not win any awards, are rela-
tively inexpensive and fairly
good. These restaurants do not
have elegant dining rooms, but
just good homecooked meals.
he Lake House Restaurant and
Cashion’s deli are two such
places. The dining room at the
Lake House looks like an army
mess hall and the deli is located
in a supermarket. However,
they each have excellent items
on their menus.

The Lake House Restau-

rant

The Lake House Restaurant
is best at breakfast. They have
all the standard combinations of
eggs, bacon, and sausage as
well as pancakes and French
toast. However, the best meal is
definitely the bacon, egg, and
cheese sandwich. Although this
sounds like something you
could get anywhere, it is much
better than any McBiscuit. It is
served on a hamburger bun,
which is somewhat untradi-
tional, but great anyway.

Grits and hash browns are
the most popular side-dishes
and are not bad at the Lake

Ideas for breakfast, lunch, dinner, vacation

ing the fruit cup, which is
served only in season.

If you are not a morning per-
son, then try the Lake House for
lunch or dinner. The large ham-
burger is excellent, because the
patties themselves come from
fresh hamburger. They have a
wide variety of toppings which
can be used to create a mouth-
watering burger that brings
back memories of Fourth of
July picnics. Unfortunately, the
small hamburger is made from
frozen patties and is not nearly

rail

if you are a
lover of South-
erm food, then
Cashion’s_ deli
is the place to

go 9

If you are looking for a
lighter meal, then the grilled
-cheese-tomato soup combo is
for you. Although there is a
salad bar to supplement this
meal, it is not very large and is
rather expensive. The barbecue
is a disappointment. There is

too much fat and gristle in the
meat, and it is not very spicy.

The Lake House is also a
good place for a mini-vacation
from Davidson. After dinner
take a trip into the bar for a drink
or two and soak up some of the
atmosphere. If you are with a
date, renting a room for the
night could be a good idea,
especially if you have an inflex-
ible roommate. Although I have
heard that the shower curtains
are flimsy, the beds are very
sturdy.

The Lake House is located
about one mile past Hardee’s on
the right. The hours are 6 a.m.
to 9 p.m. Monday through
Wednesday, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Thursday through Saturday,
and 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Sunday.
A large hamburger costs $1.95
and a room is under $30.

Cahion’s Deli

If you are a lover of South-
ern food, then Cashion’s deli is
the place to go. The daily spe-
cial for $2.29 is the best deal in
town. For that price you get an
entree, two vegetables and a
roll. The best of the entrees is
the fried chicken. You can
choose white meat or dark
meat, but both are very good.
The skin is not as crunchy as

The

fast food chicken, but the meat
is moister. There is also just a
hint of spices that adds to the
natural flavor of the bird.

Lake
House Restau-
rant is best at
breakfast 9

The spaghetti and the
lasagna taste like they were pre-
pared by Southerners instead of
Italians. The noodles are just
slightly overcooked and the
sauces are not spicy enough.
However, it is still edible and it
is only $2.29.

All of the vegetables are ex-
cellent, but I will describe just a
few of them. The potato wedges
are pieces of baked potato that
have been covered in spices.
They are my favorite vegetable
at Cashion’s, challenged only
by the green beans and fried
okra. The beans are perfect ex-
amples of the Southern style of
cooking. They are cooked for a
long time in lard to give them a
lot of flavor, but, unfortunately,
contain no vitamins. If you like
Southern cooking, you will love

the beans. Fried okra is another
Southern specialty that is excel-
lent, although it has no nutri-
tional value.

For nutrition, try the side
salad, which is only 99 cents.
While there is not a wide variety
of toppings, the salad is always
fresh. The deli also has a wide
variety of cold sandwiches.

The deli is located in Cash-
ion’s Food Mart. The hours are
11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., Monday
through Saturday and 11 a.m. to
1:30 p.m. on Sunday. At about
12:15 and 1:15 there is normally
a long line of workers on lunch
break. For faster service, do not
go at these times. If the special
does not appeal to you, any en-

tree with two vegetables is only
$2.99.

The Lake House Restaurant
and Cashion’s deli are represen-
tative of the many small restau-
rants in the area.

Next week: Mooresville
will be explored for more small
but good restaurants.
