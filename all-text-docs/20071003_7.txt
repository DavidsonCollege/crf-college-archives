Justice dialogue explores refugees, education admission

By SAMANTHA TALLEY
Staff Writer

“Does that mean I’m on?”

Rick Ufford-Chase leans forward in his
chair and looks around at the 40 or so people
crammed into the top floor of Summit. The
crowd, composed of both Davidson students
and town residents, has come to hear him
conduct one of the College’s Justice
Dialogues. Today’s issue: whether or not
illegal immigrants should be granted access
to American Social services.

“Justice Dialogues is a forum for discus-
sion on issues of social justice,” Anders
Gustafson, ’08, says. “They’re facilitated by
professors or outside professionals whose
responsibility is to present at least two sides
to a topic. From there, we like to see heavy
student engagement in discussing the various
viewpoints and, ideally, reaching some sort

Rick Ufford-Chase speaks at the pulpit.

of consensus. More than anything, though,
it’s just a great opportunity to build a relaxed
atmosphere where participants can feel com-
fortable expressing their own opinions.”

He goes on, “Our upcoming Justice
Dialogues include affirmative action in edu-
cation admissions, the practice of philanthro-
py for profit and the role of socially respon-
sible corporations and the effectiveness of
the first housing model for combating home-
lessness.”

Ufford-Chase, beyond having his own
Wikipedia entry, is more than qualified to
lead this discussion. Not only has he worked
along the Mexican-American border for 20
years, he has also served as the Moderator of
the General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church (USA) from 2004 to 2006.

In addition, he helped to found
BorderLinks, a binational endeavor that
focuses on iraising awareness of border
issues and serving border communitiesf
through immersion trips for Americans,
leadership programs for border residents,
service projects and international conven-
tions.

Ufford-Chase begins by explaining how
he first became involved with illegal immi-
gration. “I arrived on the Mexican-American
border in May 1987, in the midst of one of
the most critical church-state conflicts in 60
years,” he explains. Thousands were fleeing
the paramilitary death squads in El Salvador
and seeking refuge in the United States.
Despite the 1980 Refugee Act’s promise of a
safe haven, however, these refugees were
turned away at the border because they were
running from a government that the Reagan
administration supported.

“So in reaction churches in Tucson,
Arizona, one of them mine, started a sanctu-
ary movement,” he explained. “We would go
out on weekends, help people across the bor-
der and send them into a network of 500
churches throughout the country.”

Then, in 1992, U.S. troops stationed along
the Rio Grande between El Paso and Juarez
forced refugees to cross through the desert.
“Basically, the government was hoping that
enough people would die to make the desert
a deterrent and consequently cut down on
illegal immigration,” Ufford-Chase says.
“But what they didn’t realize was that since
the push factors were greater than the pull
factors, these people were going to keep
coming.”

“Whether levying out water
rations in the borderlands or spread-
ing awareness over coffee and pas-
tries thousands of miles away, we
are all a part of the international
community.”

The main issue then became rescuing
refugees from the desert. “Our goal was not
to protest but to respond to an immediate
direct need in a way to attract public atten-

tion to the issue,” Ufford-Chase explains.
For example, when the volunteers supplied
water rations at particularly deadly passages,
they also erected a huge water tower and
held a press conference to attract media cov-
erage.

After Ufford-Chase’s talk, the floor
opened for questions and conversation.
Participants discuss two articles, one from
the “New York Times” concerning the exclu-
sion of chemotherapy from a government-
supported health program for illegal immi-
grants and the other from the Houston
Chronicle about a bill that would make it
easier for public hospitals to treat illegal
immigrants.

When asked how people in North Carolina
can help with the border problem, Ufford-
Chase responds, “Resolution lies not in
Congress but in local churches. You can start
by helping your church find and assist
undocumented people in the area, but you
have to make sure the issue does not become
a theoretical debate because then the humane
aspect is forgotten.”
