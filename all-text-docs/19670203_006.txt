Improvements in store fronts

are becoming more frequent.

The renovations are a result
of increasing prosperity in Ia-

Blackwell. owner of The Village
Store. :

Blackwell attributes the in-
creased pfrosperity to the in-
crease in the college's enroll-
ment from 600 to 1000 and the
inereased college payroll. He
also cited new industry moving
into the area as a cause.

expressed dissatisfaction with

moment. Making three observa-
tions in a “‘view from three
blocks away.” he outlined what
does concern him at the present
time.

“Students do not feel that thev

son campus,” he said, ‘“‘but they
see it merely as a necessary
stage between adolescence and

adulthood. The answer will re-|- “

quire that we come to terms
with ourselves and the persons
and events around us.

“The degree of discrimination
on this campus bothers me.”’ he
said. “It is not racial prejudice,
but the preiudice of the cool
which results in marked divi-
sions in campus society.

“Those who need a fraternity
bid most.” he commented, “‘are
the least likely to get it." There
should be freer association, but
“not as one who is ‘in’ going

Finally Lowder criticized the
divorce between religion and

Philip B. Secor, associate pro-
fessor of the political science
department since 1963 has sub-
mitted his resignation, effective
at the end of the present aca-

ment as Dean of the College of
Muhlenburg College. Allentown,
Pa.

Secor emphasized that he felt
no dissatisfaction with Davidson
and is leaving only because of
the good promotion. He explain-
ed that Dean of the College of
Muhlenburg is a combination of
the duties of a dean of faculty
and extra promotion.

“T shall have a responsibility
to assist in faculty recruitment
and in curriculum planning,”
Secor explained. ‘‘I hope to be
able to teach as I enjoy it great-
ly and will miss it if I have to
give it up, but that will depend
on the needs of their political
science department. I would par-
ticularly like to maintain my
interest in contemporary polit-
ical theory and the Soviet Un-
ion."’
