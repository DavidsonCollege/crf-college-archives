Sophs Defeat Fresh in’
Annual Baseball Classic :

Pitcher’s Battle Goes to Upperclass-
men by 1-0 Score

Last Saturday afternoon on Sprant
Field the Sophomores and Fresh-
men engaged it an exciting base-
ball game. As usual the Freshmen
took the beating. However the!
game was very clase, the Soph-j
omores winning the verdict by a
1 to O count. A Jarge number of,
students turned out to see the.
game which was pulled off in great
style.

Considering the fact that the
Freshmen had never played to-
gether before they put up a good
exhibition of baseball.

The features of the game were
the batting of Crawford for the:
Sophomores who laced out two
triples; and the superb pitching of
the two rival pitchers, Sorrells for
the Saphomores and Hunter for the
Freshmen.

The lone tally of the game was!
made when Crawford tripled to deep
center and scored a moment later
on a close play at the plate.

0 score.

Davidson star, drop-kicked a_ field
goal from the 26-yard line. Last
year, the Baptists held the Golden

revenge is sweet, and the lads from

into ‘the old pastime last Saturday.

HAPPENINGS OF THE WEEK IN
R. O. T. C. CIRCLES.

The supply of clothing on band
was not sufficient for the battalion
and more has been ordered and will
come this weck.

The War Department has approv-
ed the requisition of automatic
rifles and jt machine gun. They have
been shipped and ought to be here
at any time.

A permanent appointment of of-
ficers and non-commissioned offi-
cers will be made about the first of
this month.

Captain Hearn was sick the latter
part of last week and his classes
were taken by Sergeant Johnson.

The R. O. T. C. cap ornaments
and sleeve insignia on their arrival
will give the battalion the appear-
ance of regular cadets and neither
West Point or the Bolsheviks will
have anything on them.

About 325 have enrolled in the R.
O. T. C. which is a considerable in-
crease over last year.

The physical examinations for the
new men have been completed and
the list of men disqualified will be
posted soon.

THE “GRIM GAME” HELD THE

Sitting spellbound gazing at the;
death-defving deeds of the slippery
Houdini on the Gym screen Satur-
day night, the student body revived
in preat measure from the news of
the game in Raleigh. his world
famous human cel in’ “The Grim

failure. However, after a few min-

+ McFadden began the second half

by booting the pigskin to Gurley,
who returned it to his own 40 yard

Wildcats began to get wild. how-:

Then came the heart-breaking
part of the game for the Wildcats.
;Faucette found a clear path for 25
jyards around right end. Gurley
hammered the line until the ball was
on Davidson's 10 yard line. In three
down the ball was carried to the
ltwo yard line, but on the last down
the Wildcats tore through State's
tline and threw her back. taking the
ball away from her. McFadden then
punted out to Faucette. who ran it
back across the line for a touch-
idown, Gurley kicked goal. making
ithe score 16 to 0. The third quarter
ended with the ball in Davidson's
possession on her own 35 yard line.

In the next quarter Cassell polite-
ly took a pass out of Murray’s wait-
ing hands and started the ball to-
wards the goal line. On the next
play, however, a mix-up in the sig-
nals caused the pass to go free and
Kirkpatrick recovered it for a touch-
down, Gurley again kicked goal,
making the score 23 to 0.

Davidson came dangerously near
scoring in the last two minutes of
play. After Gurley had kicked off
to Schenck. a pass to Douglas netted
30 yards. Another pass, an end run,
and a‘line play placed the ball on
State’s 20 yard line. A long pass that
almost found security in Schenck’s
