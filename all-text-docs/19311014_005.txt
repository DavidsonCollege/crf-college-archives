Not to Belong to a Literary Society
Was a Disgrace

college or university, and I observe that you
have a way of winning about seventy-five
per cent of all the debates you go into. Your

debates and public speeches show that a
large number of men are doing splendid
work in your Literary Societies. The only

thing to be regretted is that every student
in the college does not avail himself fully
of this-same opportunity.

“It is a pleasure to note the vast improve-
ment of your present day speaking over the
speaking that was done in the college back
in my day. T do not mean to say that you
have yet reached perfection, but “you are
making progress in the right direction. The
most of us used a stilted, artificial, declama-
tory, bombastic style. It’ was commonly re-
ported that one of my fellow students map-
ped out all of his gestures first, as if he
were making a kind of blue-print,. and then
wrote his speech to suit his gestures. I can
hear him yet he exclaimed with great
eloquence in a speech on the destruction of
Pompeii: “The full moon hung like a cres-

have never gotten over it. I am glad to see

uralness. Be natural or you will be flat, if I

was a deep note of pessimism in
f our speaking. I heard of a
number of definitions of a pessimist. Here
are some of them. A pessimist is a man who
has lived for six months with an optimist.
An optimist is a man who«looks at an oyster
and sees a pearl; a pessimist is a man who
looks at an oyster and sees a case of
ptomaine poisoning. A pessimist is a man
who wears a belt and suspenders at one and
the same time. A pessimist is a man who
having the choice of two evils takes them
both. At any rate a pessimist is a fellow who
takes a rather gloomy view of life. That is
what our speeches did. In my Junior year I
spoke on the perils of socialism. I knew all
about the perils, but I give you my word
that I did not know a thing about the first
Principles of socialism#I do know that if all
the evils I predicted had come to pass the
world itself would have come to an end long
before this good hour.

will be concluded at the cemetery.” Let us
be serious but not sad.

“Another thing that we need to cultivate
is the note of reality. This is woefully lack-
ing in some college speeches. | made one of
my college orations on “The Future of Con-

that it ought to be as it

to you at this late day that IT had very little

“No, but

Whitfield does.” When the speaker believes
what he says and believes it with a burning
conviction, there will be a deep note of real-
ity in his speaking and some body will want
to hear him.
