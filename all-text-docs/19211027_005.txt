He was too green to burn.

the corners are hurting.” True.

Some one made a long speech in chapel
last week.

What was it all about?

OFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR
BROADENED OUT THIS YEAR

Davidson has made another step to-
ward a more efficient administration in
ithe establishment of the office of regis- |
trar. There all student records are kept, !
from entrance credits to alumni records.
There all absences are recorded, al-
though the absence committee still meets
with the dean. Monthly and term grades |
are recorded there and reports sent out.
This? centralizing of all student records
in one office helps in the maintenance of
a more efficient system.

The first one to hold this office is Mr.
F. W. Hengeveld, our capable and popu-
lar coach of basketball and baseball. t

The office was formerly held by Miss
Shaw, the Librarian, in addition to her
regular duties, but has grown too heavy |
for such an arrangement to continue. |

reorganizing their various *
societies into an Auxiliary according to,
the “circle plan.” Mrs. J. R. Withers is
president, and Mrs. J. M. Douglass is)
secretary. |
