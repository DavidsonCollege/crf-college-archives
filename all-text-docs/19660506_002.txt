A Two-Way Street

The typical student reaction to yes-
terday’s Trustee action is one of “it’s
about time.’ But looked at realistic-
ally. the almost certain suspension of
Vespers is not an unqualified abolish-
ment, as many students think.

In the first place. the measure is
only a temporary one. and though it
would be admittedly difficult to re-
instate compulsory Vespers after a
two-year absence. it could be done.

In the second place, the Trustees
were willing to make the change only
with the assurance that alternative
forms of voluntary worship would be
provided. as recommended by the
Faculty Committee on Religious Life.

In the light of such considerations.
both students and faculty are faced
with the responsibility of providing a
meaningful religious life on campus.

While the suspension of Vespers
represents a “‘liberation’ of sorts. it
also entails an increase in responsi-
bility. for students to maintain a mean-
ingful worship service which will re-
place the compulsory nature of Ves-
pers.

The Trustees are by no means readv
to forget that Davidson is a Christian
college. The fact that 75 per cent
of the Trustees are representatives of
presbyteries should be enough to con-
vince the most skeptical of that.

It was only with the greatest reluc-
tance that the Board was convinced

of the rightness of its action. The

wanted to keep an institution whic

has served Davidson for such a long
time. and only its obvious obsolescence
made the Board see the futility of con-
tinuing compulsory Vespers.

Yesterday's action was also signifi-
cant for the degree of faculty-Trus-
tee cooperation which was shown. a
far cry from last spring’s fraternity
incident when the Trustees reversed a
decision of the faculty.

According to the Trustee bylaws,
matters of college policy are to be
voted on by the faculty. While the
Trustees, as the legal “owners” of
the college, are the ultimate author-
ity. such policy matters should be left
to the discretion of the faculty.

The Trustees, in allowing the final
decision to be made by the faculty,
have shown a commendable degree
of foresight.

Likewise, the faculty was wise to
consult with the Board before taking
any action. Once the Trustees un-

derstood the position of the Faculty’

Committee on Religious Life, the way
was opened for a common ground of
agreement between the two bodies.

One of the main problems which
has faced the two groups has been a
lack of communication and under-
Standing of each other’s position.
Hopefully. this issue will set a prece-
dent for such improved communica-
tion and cooperation.

The Forgotten Policeman

One aspect of the social changes
Davidson is now undergoing has re-
ceived little attention: the role of hall
counselors in helping freshmen ad-
just to college life.

Before this year a hall counselor’s
chief job was that of glorified police-
man: He did little more than keep
energetic freshmen from doing ser-
ious damages to.college property dur-
ing their periodic water battles.

The task of orienting 80 per cent of
the class was left up to the fraterni-
ties. who shaped much of their pledge
programs around such a goal. And
most of the freshman Independents
were quickly absorbed into the com-
munity.

Hall counselors were rarely both-
ered by the problems of neurotic high
school valedictorians who couldn't
make the adjustment to college life.

But under delayed rush, freshmen
are in a state of limbo; though they
admittedly have much more. contact
with upperclassmen, it is of a Super-
ficial sort and they have no real re-
lationship with any upperclassmen.
Consequently the hall counselors are
left with the problem of working with
the’ frustrated. freshman.

In addition, the counselors are now
faced with the responsibility of tak-
ing over much of the work done by
fraternities in the areas of intramur-
‘als and orientation.

Last fall, the counselors, on the
grounds of their increased responsi-
bilities, petitioned and won a slight
increase in salary, up $20 from half-
room pay of $110 per year. Now they
have presented a program to Dean of
Students Richard Burts which would
completely revamp the entire pro-
gram and concept of hall counselors,
as well as increase their salary.

The present program is very in-
formal and unorganized, a situation
which we find deplorable in light of
the counselors’ increased responsibili-
ties.

One aspect drastically needing re-
vamping is the system of selection.
At present, no formal application is
required and potential counselors have
to present no indication of interest
other than a vocal application.

Minimum requirements for accept-
ance should include a written state-
ment of why an applicant desires to
become a counselor and an interview
with Dean Burts and the Supervisor of
Dormitories.

Another shortcoming in the selec-
tion process is found in the prac-
tice of providing a balance among fra-
ternities. Undoubtedly this stems
from a mistaken belief that hall coun-
selors are a rush advantage. But with
the increased contact with fraternity
men and a semester-long rush. the
advantage of having fraternity men
on a hall will be negiigible. Such a
process eliminates better qualified
men by an artificial procedure.

The hall counselors have also pro-
posed an ambitious program which
would include more frequent and bet-
ter communication with the Déan’s
Office and more active counselor par-
ticipation ‘in freshmen’s lives.

If such a program as outlined above
were instituted. through. cooperation
between the counselors and the Dean's.
Office. we would support their con-
tention that they deserve a raise to
full room. 8220. Such a program on
the one hand would assure the selec-
tion of interested and qualified coun.
selors on the one hand and definite
duties and responsibilities of the coun-
selors on the other. But previously
there has never been any assurance
that policies. would prevail and there
has consequently prevailed much
misunderstanding on both sides of the

ence.

Good-Bye To WN?

We've heard no one mourn the ab-
breviated number of chapels this se-
mester. But the reduced assembly pro-
gram has been marked by the conspic-
uous absence of a traditional spring-
time rite: the Who's Nothing tapping.
The WN’s have been squeezed out by
the likes of such men as James Mc-
Gregor Burns and William Worthy:

We would suggest that that honor-
able group sponsor a voluntary chapel
in order to keep their ceremony alive.
A considerable number of students
would undoubtedly show up, if the
group could guarantee a program as
entertaining as the programs of the
two previous years have been, featur-
ing the inimitable professors E. F.
Patterson and Charles Cornwell.

But we suspect that such a pro-
gram would be doomed from the start.
While there would be a large student
contingent present, we doubt that any-
one worthy of the honor of being a
Who’s Nothing would take the trouble
to attend a voluntary chapel.

Mr. White is a classmate of
John Hersey (Yale °36). But
what an immeasurable distance
lies between ‘A. Yale Man” and
Too Far to Walk, Mr. Hersey's
latest work and a representa-
tive of the new campus novel.

Gone are the absent-minded
professors and the Harold Teen
undergraduates.

covered neverland bounded by

NO LONGER ISOLATED

Its walls no longer substantial-

ly isolate the campus from the
world. For better and for worse,
the campus belongs to its times
— more extensively, and certain-
ly more intensely, than most of
the professional worlds into
which colleges thrust their alum-
ni.
This radically changed. highly
charged milieu is the central
fact which the new campus novel
reflects.

“LIFE-FUZZINESS’

In “Too Far To Walk.” Her.
sey’s prototype student. John
Fist. suffers from a ‘‘a kind of
life-fuzziness."" “‘Furious at all
authority.”’ he regards college
as “the old conformist success-
chopper” where ‘learning
equals earning.”

Sick of college. sick of the
adult world. Fist inevitably
winds up crying: “I'm sick of
me,”

What Fist does not want is
perfectly clear: what his father
has. What he does want is
noticeably less clear. His good-
will cannot find objectives.

DISSIPATIONS

Even his dissipations — about
which Mr. Hersey is doggedly
explicit — are lukewarm and
haphazard. For Fist’s dominant
trait is restlessness — that least
defining trait of all.

The same motif also appears
in Dink’s Blues. Marilyn Hoff

One remembers the indigna-
tion of Dink’s narrator when an
older woman called her clean-
cut: “I thought it futile to tell
her how I resented her apprais-
al.’

But this near-innocence allows
Miss Hoff to do justice to the
adolescent, even the child, be-
neath the emergent adult. Her
novel has a tenderness, an un-
abashed concern for vulnerabiill-
ty that Mr. Hersey cannot rival.

At her best moments, the
adult world seems to belong to
another planet.

ARMED DIALOGUE

Yet ultimately” the campus

novel today is a“dialogue be-
tween generations — often an
armed ‘dialogue. At its most
simplified it is a kind of morality
play waged between Purity and
Experience.

In the stammiered dialogue be-
tween generations — tha: tragi-
comedy of mutual misquotation
— American campus novels tend
either to splutter monologues of
no-surrender (‘Dink’s Blues’’)
or to jerry-rig hopeful bridges
(“Too Far to Walk’'). The Brit-

ish seem better able to engage

the generations in exchanges
which do, in fact, exchange and
do not become, on the other
hand, sentimental day dreams
of rapport.

‘Enemy’ Points To Conflict
Of Duty, Personal Interest

A Review
By HANSFORD M. EPES

Henrik Ibsen's Enemy of the
People tells the story of Doctor
Thomas Stockmann. who discov-
ers that the ‘healing springs” of
his village, which is just becom-
ing a popular resort town, are
infested with harmful bacteria.
Thinking to prevent possible epi-
demics, he reveals this informa-
tion to his brother, Peter, who
is the town's mayor. Expecting
to be praised for his contribu-
tion, he is rewarded instead by
the hatred of his neighbors. who
‘see necessary improvements in
the water system as excessive-
ly costly: and Stockmann’s at-
tacks as motivated by personal
animosity.

Stockmann is surrounded by
characters whom he expects to
support him—in particular, the
crusading editors of the town’s
supposedly liberal newspaper.
On every side, he is let down:
The liberals cry for moderation,
or give way at the slightest op-
position. Apparent support melts
away quickly.

Only Stockmann’s family and
one friend. Captain Horster,
stand by him—and the latter's
support is basically  unin-
formed.

The drama is in ways a classic
story of the crusader and his
society: Stockmann himself is
somewhat eccentric — and thus
easily dismissed. His friends
offer drawing-room support but
are afraid to stand up at his
side—all for the most logical of
reasons. (Moderation being, aft-
er all, the wisest of all possi-
ble courses.) He is left, final-
ly. alone and discredited.

And the ‘‘enemy of the peo
ple"—as he is acclaimed at a

town meeting—turns out to be
just that, for he is an enemy
of the mob, an enemy of the
forces that easily sway others
from what he knows to be the
one right course.

Ibsen tends, of course, to seem
somewhat dated to modern au-
diences. It often seems diffi-
cult to find relevance in the is-
sues which upset society in the
late nineteenth century. In this
case, the fact that scientific
findings of a relatively simple
nature are not commoply un-
derstood and accepted as abso-
lute truth might, seem a little
ludicrous. There is, though, the
central] question of the crusader
and the society around him, the
one who is right and the many
who are wrong. This should not
seem an out-of-date problem.

Nevertheless, the danger re-
mains that such a drama might
not be viewed by today's au-
dience as much other than an
interesting and structurally skill-
ful period piece.

All of this is careful preface
to the search for reasons for
the failure of last night’s per-
formance to generate the excite.
ment that the central issues
could generate. Only in the town
meeting scene played and di-
rected with g-eat skill in the
house itself, not on the stage—
was this excitement present.
Otherwise, only too rarely was
there a sense in the audience
other than that of spectators at
a performance by an amateur
group.

Too few of the actors seemed
to have any well-developed no-
tion of the characters they were
portraying—but then many of
them were portraying carica-
tures or types. In the major

roles, only Bill Andrews (as
Mayor Peter Stockmann) really
created beleivable illusion. For
most of the rest, there was too
much reliance on one or two ges-
tures, too much acting just with
hand and mouth. Other excep-
tions should be mentioned: Don
Davis’ portrayal of the elderly
Morten Kiil and Rawley Turner
as editor Billing.

Space is short: the technical
aspects. especially sets, should
be mentioned. Ibsen is an
interesting and important dram.

morrow night.

there. is equally much and more
to be said on the “plus’’ side,
The Ford Foundation is giving
us the chance to make positive
steps forward. It. has voiced a
faith in us that I sometimes
wonder if we hold ourselves.

Davidson graduates are able

schools and compete favorably.
Davidson students have what it
takes if they will only use it.
Whether we are willing to ad.
mit it or not we gain a whale
of a lot more from Davidson
than we will ever be able to
justify or repay.

NATIONAL PLATEAU

We seem to be more used to
the idea of seJi-improvement and
advancement here than most
places. Davidson is definitely
not standing still. We are now
approaching a plateau of na-
tional competition; the days of
comparing favorably in the
South are behind us. But I would
like to see more of the attitude
required by this type of ad-
vancement reflected among
members of the student body.

Attitude is a strange word be.
cause jit can mean so many
things tt so many people. But
a wholesome attitude is one
which looks for the best in
things and people;, it emphasizes
these aspects and only criticizes
when it can offer a positive al-
ternative which promises im.
provement of a situation.

ATTITUDE

This wholesome attitude does
not then stifle criticism: rather,
it presents the only way we can
accomplish anything. If our in-
stitution warrants criticism then
it must also mean enough to us
to look for what it offers us.

Protest against required
ROTC, Chapel, Vespers, Union
food, the fraternity system. etc.
ad infinitum is perfectly legiti-
mate (and desirable) as long
as it is pursued in the proper
vein, But when this protest is
carried to the point that it re-
flects unfavorably on the school
and interferes with people who
are trying to do the. best they
ean with their respective jobs.
it. is wrong.

PROPER MANNER

When you have something
worth saying and say it in the
proper manner you are moving
toward accomplishment 6f your
goal. But to openly interfere
with something like the ROTC
federal inspection is very im-
mature, disagreement notwith-
standing.

Most forms of protest lose any

.Sensé of a dialogue, and by this

token they defeat themselves.
We all have a natural rebellion
against coercion of any sort and
little is accomplished out of a
clash. lt.is only by working to-
gether that things are really
improved. In many cases this
year we have seen what can be
done with the proper attitude,
CHANGE COMING

We have seen protests about
the Vespers situation begin to
be dealt with effectively. Change
is coming from within the fra-
ternity system and is due to a
spirit of working together. We
have seen an improved seating
situation at basketball games in
the Charlotte Coliseum. These
are only a few of the areas
where effective change has been
brought about by working to-,
gether.

When we abuse the privileges
and rights that we have, we are
being unfair to ourselves and
our successors who may wish to
take the proper route toward re-
form.. The idea of coming forth
and saying “I am for’ this or
that rather than “I am against”
it is what is called for in this
type of positive attitude.

Let's don't just “knock it;”
let's remedy it.
