“Davidson Story” a Tremendous Boost

Filming of the Davidson Story, which
began today, will undoubtedly prove to
be the biggest single shot-in-the-arm,
publicity-wise, that the College has ever
enjoyed.

If the finished product is ‘up to ex-
pectations, it may well be accepted for
national television network presentation,
with its audience of 50 million viewers.
In any event, the documentary will be
carried by a minimum of 100 TV stations
across the country, and by the Armed
Forces Television Service and other gov-
ernment agencies. More people will know
more about Davidson College than at any
time in her 119-year history.

The Banners of Freedom series, in
which Davidson is the first, is intended
by the sponsoring Protestant Radio and
Television Center of Atlanta to boost the
contributions being made to American
education by the privately endowed liberal
arts institutions. In this time of the
ascendency of state-supported universi-
ties, this theme is particularly important
to those who feel, as we do, that the
small private school is performing a ser-
vice which is indispensable.

The beneficial and widespread reper-
cussions of such publicity are immedi-
ately evident. Davidson has never at-
tained, outside of the South, the academic
prestige which it deserves. This film will
be a long stride in securing that recogni-
tion.

Outstanding students outside of North
Carolina and the South will be attracted
to consider Davidson for undergraduate
work. Also, not to be forgotten is the
financial support which will be secured as
Davidson is brought to the attention of
the nation, in this time of large grants
to education by the country’s industrial
and financial interests.

In order to enhance its promotional
value, the film will be as undated as pos-
sible. The whole production will attempt
to capture the underlying ideals, pur-

poses and philosophy of the college,
which do not materially change with pass-
ing student generations, instead of the
personalities and immediate activities
which compose Davidson, 1956. As the
plans now stand, Dr. Cunningham is the
only person who will be mentioned in
the film by name.

One of the toughest problems facing
the producers is how to present David-
son as it really is without so regionalizing
it that it would be unacceptable for na-
tion-wide audiences. It would be easy to
overdo the presentation in order to make
it suitable for national consumption, leav-
ing it in such a state that students and
alumni would quickly and verbosely con-
demn it as not portraying the Davidson
which we know. Finding a necessary mid-
dle ground will be perhaps the most
puzzling and delicate job of all.

George P. Gunn, a veteran actor and
announcer who is handling the Banners
of Freedom series for the Protestant
Center, has carefully studied the campus
and student body in an effort to make the
finished product ring completely true.

He has surveyed chapel conduct, dress
and disposition from behind the curtains
on the stage. He has conferred at length
with countless numbers of students and
faculty members. He has consumed all
the available literature on the subject of
Davidson: he is up on Peter Stuart Ney,
Phi’s chandelier, Woodrow Wilson, Dr.
Lingle, athletic subsidization and the
Snack Bar row.

Gunn is quick to emphasize that this
is strictly a big-time, professional job
which he and his crew will attempt. The
novelty of grinding cameras and _ spot-
lights will quickly wear off, he predicts.

However, the student body must real-
ize the importance and potential of the
project, and be prepared to be temporarily
inconvenienced as we work together with
Gunn and his associates in an effort to
assure that the venture will be a success.

Real Spirit Equals Winning Team

For years the lamentations over poor
athletic teams and poorer records sub-
merged any attempts to elicit vocal evi-

dences of school spirit during athletic.

events. Give us something to cheer about
and we too will demonstrate the spirit of
the universities was the comment gen-
erally applied to the situation.

As we are all well aware, Davidson
has been provided with teams capable of
winning most any contest they go into.
Especially in football, the biggest specta-
tor sport, has success been enjoyed on
the local gridiron. That this has not
solved the problem is evidenced in the
spasmodic responses to cheering attempts.

To some it appears that a cynical dis-
interestedness in anything as mundane
as football is the proper attitude for the
“pseudo-ivy league” college students to
assume. Excessive outbursts of spirit are
to be condemned as the sign of a gross
cultural deficiency.

After the student body meeting of last
Friday, this pretension should be for-
ever disspelled. Enthusiasm was mani-
fested widely, particularly in the senior
section. And the unlimited support of one
of Dr. Beaty’s caliber ought to sway the
doubters.

As we watch the players from the
stands, we demand certain standards of
action from them. Among these is the
unflagging spirit that is so necessary to
win games. It is paradoxical that we
should demand more of them than we
are willing to give.

Rather than an indication of imma-
turity, cheers, groans, and spontaneous
shouts of joy are the essential response of

a personality to its deeper drives. Be-
cause, basically, we all are proud of Da-
vidson, we ought to show it at all times,
and during sporting events real support
of the team is THE way. F.L.H.

Noted Guests

This is definitely our weekend for dis-
tinguished guests.

Politicos Abram and Albright were
here yesterday, humorist Arthur Treach-
er was on hand in Chambers earlier to-
night, and Richard Maltby and Company
will make the music in the gym tonight
and tomorrow.

Tomorrow morning, about 1000 alum-
ni will be in for a chicken ’n dumplings
luncheon and to see that justice is done to
Bill Nebraska and the visiting V.M.I. Key-
dets who provide the Homecoming com-
petition for Bill Dole’s fired-up ‘Cats.

Mrs. Clarence Hodson, who was a
belle of the ball at Davidson in years
gone by, and whose recent generosity
made the restoration of Phi and Eu Halls

possible, will be here for their dedication.

tomorrow.

But the most distinguished and wel-
come guests of them all found Davidson
at their feet this afternoon, as a 600-
strong passel of the prettiest girls in the
South took over the campus. No resist-
ance was encountered.

A 9:00 p.m. communique from our
Johnston Gym correspondent reported

_that the situation was completely under

control.
See you late Monday morning.

Tom Morgan‘s description of the
Democratic Candidate which ap-
peared in last week's Davidsonian
brings to mind a giant pot-bellied
Greek statue, standing poised and
ready, with a shovel in one hand
(to dig a canal across Africa) and
a magic wand in the other.

From the front,-he seems to be
a dove of peace (no draft or hy-
drogen bombs). On one side he is
dressed in the coveralls and cap
of the laborer, on the other, he
appears, straw-hatted and overalled
as the farmer.

The rear view bears 2s
strong resemblance to the
Democratic donkey’s posterior.

Around the statue's base, his fol-
lowers, led by Estes “Stevenson
is not talking sense” Kefauver, and
Harry “Stevenson can't win” Tru-
man, prostrate themselves before
him, chanting: “Hail to Adlai,
Beneficient Father of our Party.”

Across the Acropolis, within the
temple, experienced leaders gather

around a conference table to con:

day-to-day job of running a great

and warrant their return to office.

The influx of members of the
fairer sex into the Holy City for
the dance weekend brings to mind
a passage from Byron’s “Don Juan”
which is particularly appropriate
for Homecoming:

“Let us have wine and women,
mirth and laughter;

Sermons and Soda Water. the day

The Republican Perty has a tre-
mendous campaign advantage in
that Adlai Stevenson has to prom-
ise everything to everybody; all
Ike has to do is just grin.

Pogo is Best Choice
As People’s Possum

By GERALD WILSON

Voters will readily recall that
this is Pogo’s second try for the
office aftet being barely defeat-
ed by a margin of 60,000,000 to 0.
(This is just a round estimate) But
as the people’s possum said re-
cently, he learned a lot from 1952,
arid expects to win this time.

MIODLE ROAD CROWDED

Pogo planned to run on @

but found the middleofthe

road so crowded that he de
cided to run on a left wing
ticket up north, and e right
wing ticket in the South. He
was stunned when he realized
that this has been done be-
fore.

Unfortunately, Pogo didn’t own

a spaniel or a Dalmatian so when
they put his picture in Collier’s
he had to use a grasshopper in-
stead. He feels that this is the
real issue of the campaign.

DAVIDSON ATHLETICS

Pogo is campaigning herd
on local issues and when asked
about the Davidson College
athletic policy he seid that he
was for flexible supports
rather than rigid ones.

PRAISES UNION

Also, he is not the captive of
the Union. He speaks highly of
the Union leaders, especially Mr.
Smith, (not to be confused with
Joe.)

SOCIAL REFORM

tn the field of sociel re
form, Mr. Possum intends to
make the $64,000,000 Question
the biggest “give-away” of all
times. He advocates govern:
ment control of this program
so as to eliminate competi-
tion. ,

Thus the staff of the David-
sonian heartily endorses Pogo,
with those immortal phrases of
the first Gentleman, “Give him the
House (White)! and We Need this
guy!"

MOST DISTINGUISHED ALUMNUS

Legends of Woodrow Wilson
At Davidson Are Contrasting

(With the return of many
Davidson Alumni, and in con-
nection with next week's con-
vocation, we feel that the fol.
lowing erticle will be of in-
terest.

The following is a reprint,
in part, of an article by the
late Dr. Walter Lingle, former
President of Davidson Col-
lege.)

By WALTER L. LINGLE

Edited By Philip F. Kukura
Woodrow Wilson entered David-

son College as a freshman in the

fall of 1873. He remained at Da-
vidson for one year and then
dropped rout of college for a year
because of sickness. After that he
went to Princeton. There still per-
sist a good many traditions and
legends in connection with Wood.
row Wilson’s student life at Da-
vidson.

WAS WILSON EXPELLED

We received a letter which read:
“I would like to know if President
Woodrow Wilson was ever ex-
pelled from your College.” ...
Another letter inquired whether
Woodrow Wilson was expelled
from Davidson for stealing coal
. . + No, Woodrow Wilson was not
expelled from Davidson. On the
contrary, the College records show
that he made 100 on deportment
the whole time he was here.

We wonder how such a
legend got started. Perhaps
some student who was ex-
pelled from some school was
just looking around for com-
fort.

MADE HIGH GRADES

Another legend which persists is
that Woodrow Wilson failed on
some or all of his studies. The
College records show that he made
exceptionally good grades: English,
97; Greek, 88; Latin, 94; Mathe-
matics, 88; Composition, 95; and
Declamation, 92.

INQUISITIVE INQUIRER ASKS

There is still another legend
... that... pictures him as a
lone, lorn, bespectacled boy stand-
ing on the side lines without any

part in college activities.

GOV. GLENN TELLS STORY

How different is the story told
by former Governor Robert B.
Glenn, of North Carolina, who
was a classmate of Woodrow Wil-
son's at Davidson College: We
learn from him that Woodrow Wil-
son was a very valuable. member

‘of the Davidson baseball team for

which Glenn was pitcher.
“Davidson was playing its
strongest rival and in the last half
of the ninth inning, with the op-
posing team up, the score stood
four to three in favor of Davidson.
The opponents had a man on first
and second, with two out, and the

next batsman was the strongest
on the opposing team.

“I decided to give the batter
four bad balls and take my chances
with the next batter who was
weak. I threw a ball wide of the
plate and to my surprise the bats-
man stepped out and hit it fairly
.... it looked like a home-run.

“With the crack of the ball,

got it, but just as it got over

his head he leaped several

feet in the air and the ball
hit his hand. I¢ stuck. The
geme was over and Woodrow
Wilson won it.”

RETURNS TO DAVIDSON

The most interesting of all the
legends concerning Woodrow Wil-
son at Davidson is told by. Ray
Stannard Baker in his official life
of President Wilson. On May 20,
1916, President Wilson visited
Charlotte and .. . he came (to Da-
vidson) unannounced. Not only so,
but he asked to be let alone and
allowed to roam around over the
campus and buildings, and thus
renew old memories.

REVISITS OLD DORM

Among other places he went to
his old room, Number 13, first
floor, North Wing of the old
Chambers Building. He knocked
at the door. The freshman who oc-
cupied the room said: . . . “Who's
that?” The reply came back:
“Woodrow Wilson.” .

The freshman, not knowing
thet Mr. Wilson was anywhere
nearer Davidson than Wash-
ton, replied: “Come right on
in; you've got nothing on me.

i'm Christopher Columbus”

When the freshman sew that

it was really the President

he gave him one agonizing
look and went right out of
the window.

His official biographer has this
to say: “Davidson College always
had a warm spot in Wilson’s heart.
His correspondence in later years
showed that he never lost an op-
portunity to express his affection
or to comply with requests of stu-
dents or faculty for friendly ser-
vice.”

WILSON MEMORIAL
There should be a_ suitable
Woodrow Wilson Memorial at Da-
vidson. His high idealism should
be constantly kept before the stu-
dents from generation to genera-
tion by such a memorial.

Why Are You Dating the Girl You’re Dating?

By BOB JONES

While taking the late cup at
the Union last Sunday (which is
Davidson’s answer to TV’s late-
late show), the coffee sippers
drifted to a subject of recent
prominence: Homecoming and get-
ting a date,

The percentage of those dating
in our particular group was rather
humiliating (16 23% with two
doubtfuls). Why, we asked, are we
in said predicament?

Being of a scientific bent, we
decided an accurate poll of a
group of carefully selected individ-
uals would produce our desired
answer. Those polled were chosen
on the basis of personality (i.e.
snow power), intelligence, athletic
prowess, good looks, campus prom.
inence, and immediate presence.

We feel obliged to state that a
good deal of editing and poetic
license was exercised in the in-
terest of humor (?). In such cases,
may those concerned note that all
libel suits are being handled di-
rectly through the Davidsonian of-
fice.

Finally, our fair guests, it’s all

been in fun, and we hope you
enjoy the poll. It is always a
pleasure to have your attractive

faces on the campus . . . hurry
back!
