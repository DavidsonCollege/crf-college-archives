Christmas looters strike J.J. Howse

By RAY THORTON
As a result of some holiday
looting, one ring has been re-
ported missing from Julia Johnson
house, according to Jackie

Hughes, Director. of Public
Safety.
The house sustained $500 in
damages from the forced entry.
One radio, a bicycle and liq-
uor are also gone from the house
according to residents, although

these losses have not been filed

with Hughes’ office.

The intruders entered the
house by breaking the glass in an
outside door. “Altogether three
doors were busted,” Hughes said.

“The place was ransacked, as
if they were looking for something
specific,” he said, noting that val-
uable items including a computer
were left untouched.

Hughes assented that campus
crime is “way down” from previ-
ous levels.

- Aside from the Johnson house
theft, Hughes has been made
aware of only a few “weird
things” being missing from stu-
dent rooms. These include tooth-

paste, cassette tapes and army

fatigues.

When asked if campus secu-
rity would make changes ‘in its
system as a result.of the Johnson
house incident, Hughes replied
“none whatsoever,” rejoining that

Hughes cited combination
locks on Richardson and Cannon
as an attempt to upstep campus se-
curity, but maintained that no
changes in his office’s operation
would occur.

Locks installed in

LUCIA KENDALL
Locks have been inStalled on
the doors of Richardson and Can-
non dorms in order to prevent theft
and other security problems.
According to Director of Resi-
dence Life Tom Jennings, stu-
reported over $30,000
worth of their belongings stolen,
including $20,000 worth of lar-
ceny from dorm rooms last year.
“Almost all the thefts hap-
pened when students left the doors
to their rooms unlocked,” Jen-
nings said. “I think the only prob-
lem we might have with the locks
on outside doors is that students
might fall into thinking they could
leave their room door unlocked

wand it- would be very easy for”

someone, once inside the build-
ing, to take anything. Students
should still lock their doors.”
Public Safety Director Jackie
Hughes said, “There hasn’t been a
really big problem with theft so far
this year and many of the incidents

were weird. We’ve had several in- :

cidents in which a few things were
stolen and. other more ‘valuable
things were left alone.”

Jennings mentioned that al-
though avoiding theft was the pri-
mary reason for locking the
dorms, preventing an attack or as-
sault on a dorm resident is another
purpose of the locks.

Rich and Cannon:

The Residence Life Office
plans to install locks on the doors
of Little and Sentelle by next year
and on two more dorms next
Christmas. The office wants to se-
cure women’s and mixed dorms
first. Knox, Akers, and Irwin had
locks installed last year.

The combination style of
locks, which locks the door
whenever: it is closed, was chosen
over card systems or keys because
of the belief that students
wouldn’t want to carry keys or
cards with them. Installing elec-
tronic’ systems would have posed
mechanical problems. The prob-
lem isn’t extreme enough to put
guards by the doors, according to_
Jennings. There are no restrictions
on students entering. The locks
‘cost $400 to $500 per door. The
combinations will be changed one
or two times a year or as needed.

The panic bars that were re-
moved from the doors so that the
locks could be installed are not re-
quired by the building code, said
Hughes, and there is no problem
in getting aut of the dorm in case
of fire or other emergency. Jen-
nings said he hadn’t heard any
complaints about the locks, and
believes that residents will get
used to them quickly. He says
they can be annoying, “but they're
worth the inconvenience.”

Duke Power building branch

By MARIA DOUGLAS

Duke Power is constructing an
office building to house its ex-
panding Davidson branch. The
building will be located next to the
post office, replacing the old of-
fice at 109 Main Street-

Duke Power’s. Davidson
branch manager John Terry said,
“We need the additional space.
The new office will be three and a
half times the size of our old of-

used to accomodate the growing
Davidson community.

Originally the office housed
two employees serving about
2,000 customers. Duke Power
now employs five workers who
serve nearly 5,000 customers.

Construction . began in Sep-
tember and is projected to be com-
pleted in mid-January.

The Davidson branch pro-
vides several services to the com-
munity including: supplying

lights and reading meters. It also
receives payments, takes account
orders and handles customer com-
plaints and inquires. “Our office
does everything a large office
does except it does it a on a smal-
ler scale,” Terry said.

Its new building will contain a
small conference room available
to civic clubs and non-protit or-
ganizations. A Step Above Shoe
Store will probably occupy 109
Main Street after Duke Power va-
