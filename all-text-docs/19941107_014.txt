Women’s Soccer captures Southern Conference Title

By Krisy Ford

After sealing the regular sea-
sontitle last weekend, the women’s
soccer team traveled to the first
women’s Southern Conference
tournament in Greensboro as the
number one seed. The tournament
was held in conjunction with the
. men’s tournament at Bryan Park
Soccer Complex. The Wildcats
held true to their top ranking and
won the tournament without sur-
rendering a single goal.

There were only four teams in
the tournament, and the Wildcats
faced Appalachian State in the
opening round on Saturday. At

to-back days of competitions

close victory of 115 to 112.

Davidson College records
were broken in six events. For the

stroke and Buck with a 59.28 inthe
100 breaststroke — before the two
combined with sophomore Tim
Lim and juniorcaptain Corey Bean
to capture the 400 medley relay
record with a 3:37.85.

halftime the team had only taken
four shots on goal, and the game
was scoreless. Although the Wild-

cats dominated the second half, .

rarely allowing the ball to cross
over into their defensive half, they
were unable to convert on corners

or open field shots. At the end of

regulation with no score, the game
went into overtime, which consists
of two 15 minute periods.
Sophomore Leslie Griener
scored her first goal of the season
ona pass from Ellen Sprinkle 7:15
into the first overtime period. For
the remainder of the period Coach
Kevin Hundley could be heard on

ay

the sideline trying to keep his play-
ers focused, ‘We need to score as
much as we need to keep them
from getting an easy goal.” The

Wildcats scored again :40 into the .

second overtime period on a shot
by Lucia Plosser from Heather
Wineberg to seal their advance-
ment to the final game on Sunday.
The Mountaineers took only six
shots to Davidson's 33.

Georgia Southern, who advanced
by beating Furman 1-0. Davidson

lar season matches and completed

standout Amy Kanoff and Lora

pionship.
The Wildcats ended the sea-
_.son winning seven of their last
eight games toimprove their record
to 10-10-1, going .500 for the sea-
son. The team was chosen as the
preseason favorite. After their slow
start this season (3-9-1), no one
expected the team to break the .500
mark, much less win the Southern
Conference. Howevér, as the

women came on strong in the scor-
ing department, talk of the team
winning the tournament returned
and the Wildcats rallied to fulfill
the predictions.

Going into the tournament
midfielder Claudia Lombard,
midfielder Amy Kanoff, forward
Heather Wineberg, and Ellen
Sprinkle combined for 82 of the
team's 129 points. Lombard was
second in the conference in scor-
ing with 11 goals and 27 points
before the tournament began. Also

Football comes oh so

close, again with 9-7
loss against Centre

By Jonathan Whitcomb

Finally returning home for a
game against Centre on Parents’
Weekend, the football team was
hoping the friendly confines of
Richardson Field might provide
some inspiration.

But several offensive mishaps
doomed the Wildcats, as they fell
9-7 to the Colonels.

Evan Hjerpe kicked a 22-yard
field goal with four minutes 40
seconds remaining to seal the win
for Centre.

Quarterback Kevin Holzworth
had a another strong game, com-
pleting 16 of 33 for 162 yards with
just one interception. Chris Leak
continued his strong performance
after shifting from linebacker to
running back, gaining 70 yards on
20 carries.

Davidson took an early 7-0
lead on a 5-yard touchdown pass

Madawg’ finally drinks from cup of victory

By Matt Pitzer

After three years of coming
oh-so-close, the Madawg’ men's
flickerball team thought this was
their year.

And it was. They overcame a
close loss inthe playoffs to KA and
won five straight games in the los-
ers’ bracket to capture the IMAC
championship with a 36-20 win
over SAE.

Captain and quarterback Steve
Krause was the star, throwing for
four touchdowns and rushing for
two others.

Madawg’ has maintained the
same core of players since their
freshman season when they came
together on the Basement Belk
team.

“We were all just really re-
lieved to finally win it,” Krause
said. “We felt all along that we
were the best team this year, and if
we hadn’t won, we would have
been really devasted.”

After finishing as runners-up
in their freshman and junior years
and taking third place in their
sophomore year, Madawg’ knew

it had to beef up its defense to

capture the title.

The team added Casey Otis
and Brian Vandersea as part of that
effort. “In. guys' flickerball,”
Krause said, “defense wins games.

_ Our offense had been there all

along, but we knew our defense
had to get better.”

In the final three games, and
especially in the championship
game, that defense performed very
wellinthe clutch. Madawg’ found
itself trailing at halftime in each of
the last three games, but the de-
fense stepped up after the break
and allowed just one touchdown in
that trio of games.

In the titile game, Otis and
Thad Reece provided a very pow-

erful rush, and Jay Jennings and
Matt Melton came through with
big interceptions.

Playing togetherwiththesame .

basic group of men for four years
definitely had its advantages for
Madawg’. “It was a thing where
all of us had been playing together
for so long that everyone had a
niche,” Krause said. “We never
really talked strategy, it just all fell
into place. Everybody kind of cre-
ated their own position.”

In their last year, the team
racked up arecord of 11-1 to finish
with an estimated record over the
four years of 30-10.

The Sailing team travelled to
Florida last weekend looking for
another strong showing. The team
has been recording excellent fin-
ishes. Unfortunately, they did not
meet up to their high expectations,
with a sixth place finish out of
eight teams. The result improved

on last year’s seventh place finish.

The College of Charleston fin-
ished ahead of the pack, followed
by Florida, Eckerd, Clemson, South
Florida, Davidson, The Citadel, and
Rawlins. The team will finish the
fall season in two weeks at the
National Intersectional Event in
Charleston, S.C.

by Cedric West, who returned the
ball to the Centre 5-yard-line. The
pickoff was one of three intercep-
tions in the game, giving Davidson
six forthe season. _

But in the second quarter, the
Wildcats, whohaven’t scored more
than 14 points all season, blew
several chances to break the game
open. They had three trips inside
the Centre, but couldn’t score.

The defense stepped up and
shut down the Colonels, produc-
ing some turnovers in the second
period. Kevin Graham came.-up
with an interception, and A.R.
Barrington recovered a fumble. In
the first half, Davidson outgained
Centre 184-60 yards.

Davidson (1-7) had a first-
and-goal situation at the Centre 4,
and then had fourth down at the 2.
But the Colonels managed to block
a Sean Callahan field goal attempt.

Centre (7-2) started to take
control in the third quarter. On a
fourth down, from their 28, the
Colonels faked a punt and punter
David Clark completed a 38-yard
pass to Montas Allen, moving the
ball to the Davidson 34.

Five plays later, Joey Johnson
dove in from the 2, but Hjerpe
missed the extra point. In the fourth
quarter, Davidson’s inability to
score earlier came back to haunt
them as Hjerpe booted through his
game-winning kick.
