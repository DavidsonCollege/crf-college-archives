Richardson Stadium gets a new look

By SuziE ECKL
Staff Writer

The signs reads, “New Grass, Please Stay
on Sidewalk,” but the grass is. not the only
new thing at Richardson Stadium.

This summer, Davidson College spent
$2.5 million building additional seating, a

coach, and it is not hard to see the truth in his
words.

Gleaming in the sunlight, the freshly-
painted seats double the stadium’s previous
seating capacity. Above the stands, the new
Don Bryant Press Box stands tall over the
field and eight-lane track.

As wonderful as the new additions are for

The brand new Division | weight room, located underneath the recently-renovated

Richardson Stadium.

weight room, a press box, and a locker room
at the facility.

“The expanded stadium adds to an already -

wonderful environment,” said Tripp Merritt,
Davidson’s newly acquired head football

Richardson Stadium, some students have
expressed doubts as to whether they are
practical.

- In former football seasons, the stands were
largely empty. Now that the stadium can

hold twice as many people, will the stands
look even emptier, or will more seating
attract more students?

Merritt said that the football team must do
its part in bringing students to the stadium.

“It is winning that attracts people,” he
said, and most students would agree.

The football team may also get a boost
from the new Wildcat Pride Program in
which students receive punch cards and
rewards for attending sporting events.
Students also have more seating around the
50-yard line as there are seats on both sides
of the field.

What is perhaps the real gem of the expan-
sion resides underneath the stadium.

The Doe Weight Room, named for Gail M.
Doe and Ermest G. Doe ’69, attracts many of
Davidson’s top athletes because of the vari-

_ ety of free weights and new equipment avail-

able there.

Inside, the spirit of Davidson is almost
tangible, as the red walls and weight stands
contrast with black weights hanging from the
racks.

According to John Robbins ’07, an offen-
sive lineman for the ’Cats, the facility is
“fantastic.”

The football team practices in the weight
room at least twice a week during the season,
doing anything from range-of-motion exer-
cises to cardio work.

During the off-season, Merritt intends to
use the weight room even more often, at least
four times a week, to strengthen the team.

“It really is a Division I weight room,”
Merritt said, “and this is important, especial-
ly when recruiting.”

However, the weight room is open to
everyone, not just varsity athletes. Even

when the football team uses the weight
room, non-team members often share the
space.

Because of the emphasis on free weights,
the new facility mainly attracts the more
serious athlete, whereas the machines at the
fitness center in the Union draw in the casu-
al athletic crowd.

The weight room is open for faculty, staff,
and students Monday through Friday from 8
a.m. to 3 p.m.

“The weight room is
open to everyone, not
just athletes: for faculty,
staff, and students,
Monday through Friday
from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.”

In addition, the stadium now includes a
new locker room for visiting teams as well as
storage space for equipment.

Work on the stadium began shortly after
the end of the football season last year and
came to a conclusion on Aug. 24.

A dedication will occur at the "Cats open-
ing game against Greensboro College on
Saturday. During halftime, donors to the
project will be recognized, and Merritt will
visit with fans in the weight room after the
game.

The. Doe Weight Room, Hubbard Family
Locker Room, Don Bryant Press Box, and
Wilson Terrace will all be included in the
ceremony.
