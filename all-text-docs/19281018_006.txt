Oxford Offers Fine
B. A. English Course

By A. C. Valentine

Assistant Professor of English at
Swarthmore College, and As-
sistant tothe American Sec-

retary to the Rhodes Trust

The course in Oxford University which
leads to a B.A. with Honours in the Eng-
lish Language and Literature, involves
probably the most thorough undergrad-
uate survey of its subject offered in any
university at the present time. Although
the final examination allows the indi-
vidual considerable freedom of choice, it
demands in any case broad general
knowledge of British literature from Beo-
wulf to the present time, a good under-
standing of the chief rules of philology
and their application in the history of the
English language, a reading knowledge of
Anglo-Saxon and Middle English, and a
specialist knowledge of certain periods
considerably deeper than those demanded
by the average American college degree.

Such requirements permit few real gaps
in the student’s knoldge of English, and
many an American holder of an M.A, in
English finds knowledge woefully
piecemeal and chaotic when faced with the
exactions of Oxford honour final exams.
But no holder of a B.A, in English from
an American university or college of good

standing need feel unduly discouraged by
the Oxford
course, he is prepared to work diligently
and without dismay for two or three years
in preparation for his degree at Oxford.
He will find that, by intelligently planned
work, he has but to fill in the gaps of his
knowledge of literature to master the re-

requirements, provided, of

quirements in philology, which can be re-
duced to a minimum and almost memor-
ized, and he is ready for the Oxford

“schools.”

To be sure, if he expects first class hon-
ours, he must do more than this. Men
who have taught and studied English lit-
erature at Oxford believe there is no more
difficult school in which to get a “first,”
and certainly “firsts” in English are rare
enough, particularly among Americans.

For a “first” demands a fSundation of
real knowledge and thought, upon which
is.erected a structure of original interpre-
tation and some distinction of style. Such
a combination of merits is impossible of
attaining to some, but hardly beyond the
just ambition of a serious student with an
American undergraduate career of distine-
tion behind him. if

with infinitely greater ease erect the gor-
geous panoply of advanced degrees.
Specifically, the final examination, on
which the class of honours and the degree
itself depend almost entirely, consists of
nine three-hour examination papers select-

ed from a list of 13 periods subjects.
The average American student makes a
selection which reduces his study of

philology and Old English to minimums,
and usually chooses four of his papers

They may also offer a spe-
cial subject or a dissertation, which must
be approved by the board of the faculty,
but neither of these is necessary for the
attainment of highest honours.

In spite of the exigencies of the re-
quirements, no place could be more ideal
for the study of English literature than
Oxford. Guided by daily and frequently
familiar contact with great professors
like George Gordon, N. Nichol Smith,
‘Percy Simpson and AV, A. Craigie; in-
spired by the beauty and the literary tra-
ditions of the old city of Oxford and its
green countryside, where Addison’s walk
and Shelley’s retreats and the Scholar
Gypsies’ trail are still little altered; aided
by the priceless libraries of Bodley and
the daily possibility of meeting Masefield,
Bridfies, Chesterton, or John Buchan
walking on High Street—to the American
student Oxford sometimes seems - an
almost unbelievable place. Returning to
America with an Oxford degree to his
credit, he will realize, valuable though it
is, how much more than that degree he
has received from his two or three years’
stay in that old yet exciting city. .

She—“If you men would just stop
looking at us girls in short skirts, we'd
stop wearing them.”

He—“Yes; I suppose you'd have to
do something drastic.”

Committee Appointed
To Report on Church

Report to Cover Need and Pos-
sibility of New Church for
Davidson

At the. meeting of the Synod of North
Carolina, held in Maxton last week, sev-
eral important actions were taken. One
of chief interest to the Davidson student
body and to the townspeople is the ap-
pointment of a committee to investigate
and to’report to he next meeting of the
Synod the need and possibility of securing
an adequate church building for the Da-
vidson College Church. This committee
is composed of Dr. C. E. Raynal, of
Statesville; Dr. A. S. Johnson, of Char-
lotte; Dr. D. Clay Lilly, of Winston-
Salem; Mr. John Sprunt Hill, of Dur-
ham, and Mr. C. W. Norfleet, of Win-
ston-Salem. All of these men are vitally
interested in Davidson, residing nearby,
and several have been speakers at the “Y”
vespers.

Dr. Lacy B. Little, of the Kiangyin,
China, Mission Station, was elected mod-
erator of the Synod meeting. At this
meeting the Synod declined to request the
various Presbyteries controlling the four
woman's colleges within its bounds to
place them under Synodical control. A
committee was appointed to co-operate
with the West. Raleigh Church, which
ministers to the students of that com-
munity, toward the erection of a new
building.

Among the most important actions of
the Synod were the election of a Com-
mittee of Synod’s Work, consisting of 27
members, three from each constituent
Presbytery. This committee is to be di-
vided into a series of sub-committees hav-
ing the direction of the varied depart-
ments of the Synod’s activities. Dr. A. D.
P. Gilmour, or Wilmington, was made
chairman of this committee. The repre-
sentatives from the Concord Presbytery
are Dr. A. R. White, of Mooresville; Dr.
A. A. McLean, of Lenoir, and Dr. H. B.
Arbuckle, of the Davidson Church. Dr,

Professor Cullum Again Secures
Musician to Teach Classes
Here

Professor Cullum states that he has
again secured Mr. R. W. Trowbridge, of
Mooresville, to give private lessons twice
a week in wind and stringed instruments.
Mr. Trowbridge, who has studied in the
Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, taught
at Davidson for two days a week last year
and had several pupils, é

A room on the first floor of Eu Hall
has been provided for Mr. Trowbridge’s
use. Those who wish to study under him
may get further details from Professor
Cullum.

The Music department of the college is
sponsoring this private instruction until an
instructor in practical music can be added
the faculty. Professor Cullum an-
nounced that this may be in the very near
future, for a movement is already on
foot to have an instructor in pipe organ
for next year and to give college credit
for work done in that line. In case such
an instructor is added to the faculty, the
new $20,000 pipe organ which will be in-
stalled in the new auditorium will be used
for practice. if

This was of a nature altogether apart
from the customary tapping, bed-dumping |
and horse-play. A Japanese student, M.|
Akiyama, who has spent some time at Al-

with five sophomores in regard to styles
of wearing the conventional tie, and in the
course of the argument is variously re-
ported to have laid out cold from one to

A fellow freshman of Mr. Akiyama’s
informs the Intercollegiate Press that the

Akiyama in an effort to shear his tie as
a penalty for wearing it within his vest.
They succeeded, but Mr. Akiyama, not
versed in western ways, resented the at-
tempt and laid about him with a few jui-
jitsus tricks (in which he is an expert)
and knocked out one of the sophomores.
One of the blows, reports say, was not

Akiyama claims, however, that the blow
was perfectly in accord with jui-jitsu
regulations, and alleges that a man has
the privilege of defending himself ac-
cording to the rules of his own people.
Akiyama points-to the fact that he is a

Middleton, Conn., Oct. 17—(1P)—The

that guessing a man’s vocation and ability
by his photograph is generally impossible.

A successful engineer was classified by
half the students as a clergyman—and the

The conclusion from the experiment,
Dr. Landis would have us believe, should
be that sending a photograph with an ap-
