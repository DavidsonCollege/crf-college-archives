THE DAVIDSONIAN

MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1996

I called Davidson “home” for
two years, and recently returned to
visit my old friends here. Upon
asking them, “What’s up?” I in-
variably received the reply: “Noth-
ing much. Nothing really changes
around here.” One observed:
“Well, nothing’s really changed
around here in the past 150 years,
except for the addition of women,
and some people don’t seem to
have noticed that yet.”

I understand that many of the
things I say will be offensive and
inflammatory, and in some ways
they are intended to be so. I do
make generalisations and stereo-
types, and sometimes I exaggerate
for emphasis. But in it all, watch
for the grain of truth, because it is
unmistakably there.

Davidson in some ways grew
to be a college for the sons of rich
plantation owners, and hasn’t quite
been able torid itself of that stigma.
I am almost tempted to draw a
parallel between the old practice
of slavery and the current one of
“buying” international and minor-
ity students, the majority of which
are on very generous amounts of
financial aid (thank you,
Davidson). With due respect to
students not included in those cat-
egories, ever noticed who consti-
tutes (over the years) the majority
of student workers in the cafetaria?
If the ratio of students engaged in
work/study, as well as those who
cater and work in the cafetaria for
extra money, were extrapolated to
the rest of the student body, we
would havea really colourful cam-
pus. No more J. Clones and khaki.

Which brings me to my next

_OPINIONS

Looking backward

point about reasons for “buying”
internationals and minorities (aside

. from the cheap labour) — for exhi-

bition. The admissions office needs
a nice, diverse looking glossy to
help remove that nasty taint of
“racism” which seems to follow
the word “Davidson” in the minds
and mouths of international and
minority students here. Again, if

Students on Exhibition ... A stu-
dent (notice, a white, Southern
American male student) pointed
out that even he felt uncomfortable

campus. Especially those interna-
tional students who stay here over
winter break ... While many stu-
dents are at their nice, warm homes
with their families, opening gifts,
those who remain are kicked out of
their rooms and sent to “refugee
camp” — an affectionate term for
the lounge they reside in, cots laid

On a quick tangent, I would
like to point out that I’m not an
African- American, and don’t have
the right to speak for them, but my
guess is they aren’t particularly
thrilled with a lot of aspects of this
campus either. Let’s face it — as
one of my best friends pointed out,
“Beggars can’t be choosers.” How
many less international and minor-
ity students would we have if
Davidson didn’t give out the fi-
nancial aid it does to those groups?
Hey, that’s okay, we’re used to it.
The white man has traditionally
controlled the world for its own
purposes — why should Davidson
be any different?

Back to the idea of Diverse

I am writing in response to
Vinod Thomas’ letter last week
about my article titled, “Yes, lam
an angry feminist.” Vinod Tho-
mas attacked me for citing “ex-

in foreign, non-Western coun-
tries.” He chastised me for ne-
glecting to mention inequalities
that exist in the Western world.
What he failed to note was that I
qualified my statements about
Pakistan by mentioning that Pa-
kistan was not the only country
where problems existed for
women. The pulled quote in my
article concerned the level of op-
pression women “all over the
world suffer.” I then went further
tomention that in the United States
twenty- five percent of women
are victims of sexual assault at
some point in their lives.

What I perceived to be the
situation in Pakistan simply pro-
vided the impetus for me.to write
the article, and thatis why I chose
to expound on that particular is-
sue. The point of my article was
hot to attack Islam, or third world

sues” do exist. It would have been

or rather blatantly state that I am
perpetuating the belief that in-_
equality between the sexes has
been eradicated in the U.S. Let
me ask you this question— if I
were to write an article about
rape statistics in the U.S., would
anybody question why I didn’t
expound upon similar issues in
Bosnia, Ghana, or Pakistan?
Would I be, by definition, infer-
ring that those problems didn’t
exist in those countries? The
answer, I’m sure is no.

On a more personal note,
women’s issues in non- Western
countries affect me directly as I
am half Indian Muslim, grew up
in India, have spent a lot of time
in Pakistan, and have plenty on
family in both Pakistan and In-
dia. I am, in no way, trying to,

product. I resent the fact that

But what happens when it

_- Maybe I was imagining a lot
of these things, that my friends and
I were just unhappy because we
were in a strange country away
from home and weren’t used to

things. But it’s hard to “imagine

away” two really difficult years,

‘not just mine, but those long years

of so many other people who share
a common experience. It’s not to
say that there aren’t good things
about Davidson; there are. But I
transferred out to another school,
and now, having a comparison, I
simply cannot believe what so
many people here put up with.

We are often asked to cite
specific examples of what is really
wrong, and I have. But it’s more
like a birdcage: if it were any one
prejudice, any one unpleasantry,
any one constraint, it would be the
one wire of a birdcage — we could
easily fly around it.

However, when there are a
large number of injustices, of stu-
dents ignored, we are faced with a
thousand criss crossed wires from
which we cannot free ourselves to
fly, to learn, to experience the full-
ness of all that might be “the col-
lege experience.” Davidson has
great things to offer many people,
and just sometimes, we’d rather
not walk alone.

Skinny Girls was more

After read James Berry’s cri-
tique of “Skinny Girls” I was
shocked! And then I got upset.

I feel sorry that perhaps the
author of the article was too busy
jotting down notes to really listen
to the message of the-play. So
much for the intimate feel of the
Black Box Theater, if all you CAN
hear is “the actors. . . crack their
knuckles”! The whole idea of pre-
senting a play in the Black Box
was to give such an intimate look
into this deeply disturbing psycho-
logical problem that has a pro-
found effect; not only onthe psyche

‘ and reasoning of an anorexic or
_ bulimic, ‘but also on their family

asibling or a friend, but for me, the

play’s examples rang a little too ©

true. The most powerful aspect of
this production was that it didn’t
regurgitate statistics and textbook
explanations. The audience wasn’t
bombarded with faceless numbers
related to the typical “13-25 year
old females, usually white, middle
to upper class. . .” Instead it offered
suggestions about the multiplicity
of possibilities as to why this dis-
ease affects some women and not
others, how to deal with it, etc.

To anyone who attended and
listened, your awareness WAS
heightened. I feel that the author
of last week’s article showed a
callous disregard to the message
that the actors and playwright de-
picted with profession ease. The
article was disrespectful not only
to the actors, but to anyone who
has ever struggled, or watched
someone battle with diseases.
I would hardly call the depiction of
