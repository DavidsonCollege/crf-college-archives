Women on the Court

New Dean of '
Students may
confront changing

‘social trends

By Rachel Dunifon

Back in the dark ages of the
1960’s, Davidson was what Dean
of Students Will Terry calls “a
Suitcase college.” This changed
partially in 1969, when alcohol
was allowed on campus. The big-
gest change to Davidson’s social
life, however, came in 1973 when
the first freshman class with women
was admitted. The first women
who wanted to participate in Patter-
son Court activities joined one of
four co-ed eating houses that de-
veloped soon after they arrived.

Even some fraternities, such as Pi

Kappa Alpha, had women mem-
bers eating at their houses.

The trend of co-ed houses be-
gan to change in 1977 when Rusk
House was formed by women de-
Siring a better support group, as
wellas better food. Over the years,
asizeable number of women joined
Rusk, and its increasing size even-
tually led to the formation of
Warner Hall House. Spencer
House, which folded last year,
opened in 1985, and Connor House
came on the scene in 1992.

According to Terry, the cre-
ation and popularity of women’s
eating houses, along with an in-
creased interest in fraternities
among Davidson students, led to
the downfall of co-ed eating houses,
the last of which closed in 1990.

While Terry believes the pres-
ence of women at Davidson and on
Patterson Court has done a great

deal to make the school a stronger
community, he expected more
positive outcomes to occur with
their arrival. “The social life hasn’t
changed as much as I had hoped,”
Terry says.

He sees the current social-at-
mosphere as a continuation of the
previously existing fraternity-style
parties on the court. Instead, he
would have liked to have seen fe-

male leadership on the court lead |

to more creative social options,
including events that facilitate so-
cialization and a focus on people,
rather than alcohol.

Terry predicts an intense study
of Davidson’s social life will oc-
cur within the next three to four
years, possibly leading toa change
in current social patterns on cam-
pus. He claims that this will be the
first major challenge for his suc-
cessor in the Dean’s office.

competition is inevitable. “It is
natural for each house to want its
own character and pride, but when
the competition starts to hurt other
houses, then it is unhealthy.”
Bennett thinks the differences be-
tween the houses should be posi-
tive: “There shouldn’t be fighting,
but differences can be good. That’s
how people choose one house over
another.”

Patterson Court Council un-
der Petty’s leadership has made
some positive changes, including
writing a new charter with bylaws
that put more responsibility on the
court itself, along with a judicial
board to solve internal problems

mote the Court as a campus-wide
organization, not just for social
options.

sible for this year’s newly revised
alcohol policy. Petty feels that
Patterson Court and the Council
are “finally gaining the recogni-
tion they deserve.” Patterson Court
Council is involved in organizing
such activities such as Day at the
Lake, “after dinner” discussions in
the women’s eating houses, and
most importantly, a women’s com-
mittee made up of house presi-
dents and vice presidents. Petty
points to this committee as instru-
mental in several changes being
made in the eating house system,
such as Women’s Weekend.

Petty, Bennett, and Foster
think being involved in an eating
house is a worthwhile experience.
Bennett thinks eating houses are
one of the best things about Patter-
son Court because there is no pledg-
ing, no ordeal - you just sign up.”

Petty believes being a mem-
ber of an eating house engenders a
sense of responsibility: “You real-
ize how tough it is torun a house -
to operate a kitchen and feed a lot
of people, but also to get things
done. It really opens your mind to
other personalities and learning to
work in a group is vital.”

School rises in liberal arts rankings

Rank continued from page 1

mentioned, “[Davidson’s] goals are
more internal than external. We
want to do the best job in under-
graduate teaching.”

U.S. News and World Report
magazine began their annual rank-
ing of “American Best Colleges”
- seven years ago. The rankings are
used primarily by schools for mar-
keting purposes and possibly for
selection -factors for prospective
students.

The report ranks schools in
four primary categories: national
universities, national liberal arts
colleges, regional (north, south,
midwest, and west) universities,
and regional liberal arts colleges.

¢ Past Davidson Rankings

In 1993 Davidson ranked 18th,
1992-22nd, 1991-10th, 1990-15Sth,
1989-20th, and in 1988-15th. Be-
fore 1988, the rankings only in-
cluded the top ten. (Source: Sept.

Dave Matthews band ends early

By Mandy Curtis

After only two hours of play-
ing, the Dave Matthews Band was
shut down at midnight on Saturday
due to complaints from local
Davidson residents. The concert,
sponsored by Patterson Court, was
held in the center of the court.
Many students, organizers, and
band members were disappointed
with the abrupt ending of the event.

The concert was organized by
Warner Hall social chairs, Heather
Galano and Cindy Ebbs. As the
finale to Women’s Weekend, the
band was contracted to play until
1:30 a.m., according. to Galano.
After all of the time and money put
into the night’s festivities, Galano
says she and Ebbs were “really
upset” that the band was shut down.

According to Patterson Court
Adviser Kurt Holmes, the residents
on Main Street began complaining
to the Davidson police about the
noise when the band started at about
10 p.m. Residents and the police
called President Kuykendall about
the situation, and he made the de-

cision to have the campus police
end the show at midnight.

Many complained that the
stage should not have been facing
Main Street; however, Galanosays
that the power cord from the BSC
would not have reached the stage
had it been facing the apartments.

According to Galano and
Ebbs, the residents, Davidson po-
lice, campus police, and
Kuydendall were all notified that
the band would play outside.

Up until that point, everything
was going really well, says Holmes.
He says that all of the credit goes to
Galano and Ebbs. -:

The Dave Matthews band,
from Charlottesville, Virginia, was
“phenomenal,” according to
Galano. This is why it was so sad
that they were shut down, shesays.

Galano added that the band
“loved Davidson” and thought that
the people they met were “really
cool.” She says they were really
excited about playing here and were
“bummed out” about ending early
and would love to come back.
