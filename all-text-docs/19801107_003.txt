Lack Of. Student Voice Produces Stingy Alumni

_ Davidson's level of alumni giving—31%
with Wildcat Club donations, 28% with-
out them—can hardly stand’ alongside .
these other schools:

Why isn’t alumni‘giving at Davidson
higher? This is a difficult quéstion to
address since many of the factors
influencing it are qualitative.. Davideon’s
giving program, however, is afflicted by
some easily. discernible: ‘problems, which
I shall mention, but there is one rather
serious impediment:which many admin-
istrators. probably do not see—the
schism that exist at Davidson between
the Trustees and administration on one
side and the faculty and students on the
other.

The alumni giving program, as it is
organized now, is a relatively recent
innovation at Davidson. The system of
class chairpersons and. agents conduct-
ing a large-scale mail campaign to solicit
members of their class has been employ-
ed for the last 25 years or so, whereas the
schools mentioned previously have a
longer tradition of calling upon their
alumni in this way. Some of these
schools, according to Living Endowment
Director Lee Willingham, also impress
upon each incoming class the importance
of alumni giving so that a definite
“competitiveness” is fostered between
each class. Davidson, Willingham said,
does not believe in this approach.

The only other significant difference in
procedure between our program and
these others is the extent to which
telethons are used. Some of these
institutions ‘conduct. more telethons—
which have proven benefits on alumni

giving—than Davidson; the College has
not run a telethon since 1978, though one

is being organized: now for early Dec-

ember.

graduate leaves his school will influence

Church’s support of the school; N.C.

Even with the concentrated drive of
the Living Endowment program over the
last ten years, alumni giving at David-

have mentioned some of the convetition-

al reasons given for why alumni giving ‘is

not: higher, and they are all probably
related to the problem. But I think there
must be a more deep-seated reason that
people have failed to look for, and this I
believe is the apparent divergence be-
tween Trustees/administration on one
side and faculty/students on the other.

. In other words, I think the Trustees and

administration of Davidson College as
one body and faculty and students as
another body are so polarized that it
leads some students to graduate vowing
never to give money to this school.
It’s difficult to support this state-
ment—there are no figures to cite—but
it seems apparent to my eye that this
situation exists. That the Trustees and
administration are too insular seems to
be a prevalent attitude on this campus.
However, the problem is also aggravated
by the fact that few students bother to
approach the administration about: pol-
icy decisions. There is too much of an
abyss between these two bodies who
both have a role in the life of the College;
if there was more integration between
them I think a greater number of
students would leave Davidson with a
better attitude about the College, or at
least with the satisfaction that an
attempt is being made to bridge a gap:
I don’t know how this can be achieved;
perhaps a student trustee is a starting
point. But as the situation currently
exists, alumni are being asked to give
money to a school that allowed them
only a minimal voice in shaping its
policy while they were students. -

Overall, however, Griffith

thinks the ratio is fair. “I can:

Allen and Hester feel the use
of a ‘ratio is inherently ‘unfair.
‘‘We’re really concerned with

oppose any ratio—even fifty-

acceptable policy.
