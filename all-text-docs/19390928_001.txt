average of 1.9153 for the year

As figures released from
registrar's office reveal, the
petition was rather close, the S.A.-

Averages

On the whole the fraternity aver=
ages are much better than 1937-38.
The average for all Greeks is 1.78
as against 1.6 that year. The 1937-
"38 high was 1.82959 as against the
1.9153 mark chalked up.by the 1938-
39 winners.

However, the Greeks have failed
to the 1936-37 mark. . The
fraternity average that year was
1.9 and three groups averaged over
2.000.

The fraternity average is almost
identical with that of the entire
student body, both being approxi-
mately 1.78.

Actual ratings follow: Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, 1.9153; Pi Kappa
Alpha, 1.9127; Kappa Sigma, 1.8939;
Phi Gamma Delta, 1.8709; Pi Kappa
Phi, 1.8366; Phi Delta Theta, 1.7766;
Kappa Alpha, 1.6794; Sigma Phi
Epsilon, 1.6188; Beta Theta Pi, 1.-
5643.

Highest average ever reached in
any one year was the 2.314 mark
set by Sigma Phi Epsilon in 1932-

fall far below that record but are
‘in most cases below the ten-year

averages disclosed last year.

The S.A.E.’s, Pika’s, and Pi Kap’s
were the only’ three groups to ad-
vance above their ten-year marks.
The other six lodges dropped be-
low the average chalked up during
the past decade.
