Sophomore Rush: A Hope...

The faculty surprised themselves
and a student body when they climbed
out of their rocking chair and out on-
to a limb last Tuesday afternoon. They
asserted a right and a responsibility
to intervene in stadent affairs where
they felt that intervention was war-
ranted. They voted by a solid mar-
gin to make a radical change in the
college social organization; they ac-
cepted risks which are incalculable
unti] the new system is in actual op-
eration. In sbort, they went out on
a limb and they can’t climb back down
without tearing their pants.

Perhaps the most unfortunate as-
pect of the sophomore rush ruling is
that the faculty had to intervene.
President Martin said that the ruling
is not to be taken as a slap at the
LF.C.—nor is it evidence of a trend
toward increased faculty influence in
student affairs.

We fervently hope this is the case.
In the past, the faculty has often ac-
quiesced on issues where student
opinion was overwhelmingly one-sid-
ed. The faculty has, on occasion, giv-
en the students a passive vote of con-
fidence by not taking action where
they thought that action might have
been needed. We trust that the fac-
ulty will not tack preferential bidding
onto their sophomore rush regula-
tion. This is a job for the LF.C.

We hope that Tuesday's ruling is
an exception—that the faculty will
not use this radical movement as a
stepping stone to a policy of trying
to solve all student problems. The
faculty-student relationship is now
fairly sound. But increased faculty
intervention will lead to bitterness on
the part of students and a breakdown
in student government.

...And A Warning

Sophomore rush will be a reality in
1961. It is unlikely that the faculty
will back off now, no matter how ex-
emplary fraternities become next fall,
no matter how many petitions are
signed, or how many professors are
button-holed in earnest personal pro-
test. Actually, sophomore rush is a
reality right now.

The next two semesters will be a
major factor in determining the suc-
cess or failure of the new program.
Fraternity men who think they can
make the faculty’s decision backfire
by acting like truculent kids reacting
to an unpleasant parental decree are
in for a rude awakening. To sabotage
the new system would be to risk forc-
ing the faculty’s hand again—and the
results then would be even more dras-
tic for fraternities than last Tuesday’s
action.

Instead, fraternities should begin
positive preparation for the big
change in 1961. The LF.C. should
begin immediate study on a preferen-
tial quota bidding system. This is
tailor-made for a deferred rushing
program. It would help insure that
four or five fraternities will not grow
disproportionately stronger, while two
or three small fraternities are being
completely wiped out.

Sophomore rush will not be a pan-
acea for all fraternity evils, real or
imagined. It won't solve all the prob-
lems and chances are excellent that
it will dump on us a. truck-load of

problems we've never had before.

But we feel sure of one thing: if
sophomore rush can reach the goals
its supporters have set for it, the sys-
tem will be well worth trying and
keeping. If the freshman will be able
to make a calm, rational choice as to
whether or not he wants to pledge a
fraternity, or which fraternity he
wants to pledge, we're all for it. If
the freshman’s academic life is en-
riched, if he is able to squirt a trans-
fusion of new blood into extra-cur-
ricular activities and athletics, the
new system will pay for itself.

These are big ifs. The faculty and
administration can’t turn them into
realities by serving as a law enforce-
ment body. It boils down to this:
sophomore rush, a system which elev-
en out of twelve fraternities voted
against, can succeed only if the fra-
ternities make it succeed. Only the
fraternities can make sure that dirty
rushing doesn’t run rampant. Frater-
nities can solve some of the biggest
problems in a system they didn’t want
in the first place.

If we co-operate and the new sys-
tem still doesn’t work, we feel cer-
tain that the faculty will have sense
enough to go back to the old way.

And finally, a warning: if we act
like a bunch of pouting kids, and the
new system doesn’t work, there may
be dire consequences. When the fac-
ulty climbed out onto the limb, they
took the fraternities with them. -

A Note To Tired Crusaders

“Fresh as the breezes of spring time,
Clear as the morning dew;
Earnest in building for manhood,
The work of the W.C.T.U.”

—-From the White Ribbon

The North Carolina White Ribbon,
official newspaper ‘of the Women’s
Christian Temperance Union, came
across our desk this week—and with
it, a moral for Davidson Gentlemen.

Not the obvious moral, though; we
won’t assert that the work of the
W.C.T.U. is as fresh as the breezes
and as clear as the morning dew.

But the temperance ladies do force
us to one observation: idealism is not
dead. When we feared most that cyn-
icism had overtaken our nation, the
luminous (if futile) enthusiasm of the
W.C.T.U. allayed our fears.

And so we bass on to our readers a
few quotes from the White Ribbon,
that our hoary old college as well as
W.C.T.U. members may see—if not
share—this fervor for a lost cause.

Consider the President’s Message:
Liquor “has so influenced some .. .”
opines Mrs. Edith Scott, “that they
cannot think clearly.” And she con-
tinues: ‘We cannot afford to take our
ease in Zion! Let us work, pray and

give, that the day may come when
King Alcohol may be banished!”

While the ladies are working, pray-
ing and giving, they presumably have
their children making speeches at
Youth Temperance Council meetings.
From the minutes: “Jimmy Summey
... Said he overheard some boys talk-
ing one day. One was bragging about
all the beer they had. The boy said
he went home, opened the refrigera-
tor, and drank all the beer he wanted.
His dad bought it all for him.”

And: “Ann Language gave a speech
about a little boy named Humpy who
obtained his name because his father
drank.”

Davidson Gentlemen tired of
campus issues may find a worthy
cause here. They might begin making
plans to attend the Total Abstinence
Training Camp at Flat Rock, N. C.,
which the White Ribbon reports will
be held August 22-26. Four days of
Total Abstinence Training can be had
for only fifteen dollars, too.

And for a fairly reasonable sum
(say, the cost of two fifths) one may
become a Rock-of-Ages Member of the
W.C.T.U.

We think it sounds like a good
thing. E.S.D.

Sophomore Rush Affects All Campus Life

By DAVID JORDAN.
Devidsonian Meneging Editor
What will be the results of

sophomore rush? What can the
college as a whole expect from
such a change? These are the
real questions following the
faculty’s surprise action lest

tfe at Devideon.

Perhaps the most glering
problem is that the college is
not presently to as-
sume necessary responsibility
for a body of about 400 non-fra-
ternity men a year to which it
is now committed. This was the
primery reason for delaying the
introduction of the new system
until 1061.

First, eating fecilities are
insufficient for such o lerge
body. Continued use of the
Union is impractical without
considerable expansion. The
basement of Chambers hes
been termed an “idea! place”
by Geerge Shew, Slater Serv-
ice manager, but even this
would not be a complete solu-
tion.

Without question, the Union,
under its present program,
would be greatly overtaxed in
serving as a center for this
group. A broadened program
would still be handicapped by

lack of space and physical fa-
cilities.

had the choice again, they’d

The seniors answered five
questions:

Are you glad you took ad-
vanced ROTC? Why?

gested other advences: “More

“Reduction in factual train-
ing. removal of all weapons
instruction, increased study
of U. S. strategy and de-
fansive theory, U. S. military
alliances and contemporary
weld problems.”

They listed as drawbacks toss
ef academic time, skimming
over “a broad range of material
which is mostly nebulous in it-
soit" and the teaching of
“Spores of facts and manuals

Ono senior wrote: “With

The seniors were terse in list-

ing the strong points of student

Another: “S27 monthly—com-

Only one student answered
negatively: “Actually, can’t

have to prove themselves to 250
freshmen each year.

With a full yeer os indepen-

ber in the past? If the college
furnishes an sdequete pro-

it must if sophomore rush is
to be feasible, wilt eo great

Undoubtedly the quality of
freshmen work should improve
and the extent of their partici.

of the usual demands placed on
their time. The prospects of |
the renewed prosperity of dra-
matics, debate, literary activi-
ties, etc., brighten to a great
extent.

All ramifications of the fac-
ulty’s action are unimaginable.

THese few are sufficient to
indicate that sophomore rusb
will necessitate a careful ex-
amination of present policies
and programs and concrete ac-
tions for the future.

LETTER TO EDITOR

What is the educational value Dear Editor,

of ROTC training?

What improvements
needed in ROTC?

-What are the chief strong

points of ROTC training?

What are the chief draw-

backs?

There was complete agree-
ment on the first question.
One senior summed it up:
“From a purely mercenary
point of view, | collected six
or seven hundred dollars in
two years for a nominal
amount of work, inconven-
ience and responsibility.

“From another point of view,
1 will be an officer for two
years instead of an_ enlisted
man, ROTC is one of the more
acceptable ways of succumbing
to conscription.”

One senior added: “Believe
it or not, an element of patriot-
ism is involved.”

The second question — on
the educational value of
ROTC—again brought similar
answers. “Negative” . . .
“ , . «+ almost non-existent’
«+ “too regimented.”

About half of the students
said the summer camp training

was the only training of lasting

value; one other cited “practical
leadership, speaking before a

gtoup,” as part of the educa-

tional value.

Is there room for improve-

ment?

The seniors praised ROTC

that one of the most impor-

I am referring to Dick Smith,
a major in ROTC, having a more
than sufficient academic aver-
age than that which is required
for membership, and above all
the Editor of THE DAVIDSON-
1AN for this semester. Prior to
this semester he was Assistant
Editor and devoted a large
amount of his time to the im-
provement of THE DAVIDSON-

As Editor, he was required
to shoulder great responsibil-
ity. Not only did he have to
coordinate a large staff, but
his paper influenced the alum:

body. In addition it gave an
impression of Davidson Col-
lege to many off-campus read-

It ista point of view that deserves being put into
words, given wide circulation, and subjected to critical

_ Briefly, the viewpoint expressed by so many influ-
ential friends of the College is this: the fact that the Da-
vidson faculty is being filled up with Davidson alumni
is not one to make us uneasy, but rather a cause for
rejoicing.

After all. who can better cherish, understand and
propagate Davidson’s inimitable ideals and traditions
than her own graduates? What has the outside world
to offer that is comparable to the devotion of Davidson's
own sons to their alma mater?

The poor church-supported college cannot, of course,
compete with state-supported schools and heavily en-

ers.

1 believe that grudges har-

exclude Dick from ODK.

To me, leadership is a char-

sidered and judged impartially.
If certain leaders are going to

duly little sense here that these—ugh!—realities might
be more exciting in a more enlightened world.)

_ The foregoing, I repeat, deserves to be made ex-
plicit; its merits should be recognized and widely pro-
claimed; at present it seems to be but a tacit crsumption
on the part of the College’s policy-makers.

FACTS SPEAK DIFFERENTLY

Unfortunately, a part of College policy seems to be
a determination to keep this viewpoint under the table,
tacit and unexpressed; an official representative of the
College states that the percentage of alumni on the Da-
vidson faculty is on the decrease! ;

Any non-alumnus staff-member, I believe, would
consult the records, determine the facts, give a slight
shiver, and come up with a somewhat different answer.
