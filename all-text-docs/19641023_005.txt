HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN
Basketball

I practice has begun and the practice has'
has brought with it a fast rising renewal of the basketball |B

enthusiasm that constanty rose last year until the ’Cats’: oe

hopes were crushed by Bill Blair and his VMI cohorts in

the semi-finals of the conference tournament.

Basketball magazine. as everyone knows by now,

cks the nation, behind UCLA and.
ichigan, and the new NCAA Basketball Guide notes

that Davidson should take the conference title in a “run-

icks Davidson as third in

away.”

All this enthusiasm and optimism isn’t unwarrant-

ed. In fact, one wonders how the Wildcats could lose with

Hetzel, Davidson, Snyder, and Teague all back with a Pw

year’s more experience.

It seems to me that there are three major question
marks concerning this year’s team—the strength under
the boards with 6'7” Terry Holland gone, the effective-
ness of Holland’s replacement on the Starting five, and
strength on the bench.

Actually, | don’t think that the rebounding will be

a big sweat with 6'8” Hetzel teaming with Snyder and

Davidson, both 6’5” and both great jumpers.

It may be uncertain who will start in the fifth spot,
but both Charlie Marcon and Ronnie Stone are sharp

shooters who will improve
the ’Cats’ outside shooting.
Either of them probably
could have started for any
other team in the confer-
ence last year, and it looks
to me that Lefty’s problem
of choosing between the
two is a pretty pleasant one.
As for bench strength,
the Wildcats don’t have the
depth that schools like Duke
have because of the limited
number of scholarships.
However, either Marc-
on or Stone will be on the
bench, and that is about as
Strong a number six man as
a coach could ask for. Paul
Briggs will probably be
number seven, and if his
performance in the scrim-

mage last Saturday is any indication of how he will per-

form this season, it looks like he will really be an asset

to the team both as a scorer and as a big man under the
oards. .

Davidson had about the same depth situation last
year and managed okay, and looks as if the Wildcats stay
reasonably out of foul trouble, the depth, or Jack of it,
won’t be major problem.

Actually, major problems are non-existent. Davidson
should be favored in every game this year. When, and if,
Driesell’s charges get beaten, they will be beaten by an
off night, not by a superior team.

SIDELIGHTS

After watching quarterback Ronnie Smith and his
mammoth ends, John Hilton and Pete Emelianchik, in
action Saturday, it’s hard to see how Richmond has lost I
at all.

‘Five new rows of seats being installed in Johnson
Gym will increase the seating capacity by 300. Also being
installed in the gym is an elaborate press box for radio,
TV, and press. It will be suspended from the ceiling above
the blenchers opposite the student section.

VPI is the only Southern Conference member not
on Davidson’s basketball schedule. Davidson hasn't play-
ed the Gobblers since 1961, when.a hassle between Lefty
and Tech’s Athletic Director Frank Mosely brought the
series to a halt. VPI must have trouble getting along—
hard feelings have ended its basketball series with arch-
rival VMI also.

Davidson's rifle team, undefeated with a 1-0. slate,
has the best record among Davidson teams now in com-
petition. The cross countrymen aren’t far behind, holding
a 4-1 mark.

Driesell is again holding closed practices, but the|
*Cats will have open scrimmages tomorrow afternoon
and next Saturday afternoon. oa |

Heckard’s 15 completions Saturday set a new David-
son record. Pretty good for a converted end. |

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Davidson's soccer team kick-
ed Duke 5-1 here Friday in
its most impressive victory of
the season to boost the Wild-
cats record to 3-2.

The contest was played in a
constant downpour before an
audience of five spectators.

Commented Coach Fogleman,
“The field was in very bad con-
dition with three to four inches
of water standing

Fogieman singled out Gus
Brown and Willie Edmunds for
playing a good defensive game.
Fog:eman has now began pla-
tooning his halfbacks, who do
the most running. George
Brown and George Nzongo‘a
have been alternating with
Bruce Swain and Rat Curry.
“Although none of the halfbacks
have scored yet, they have giv-
en a better offensive punch,”
Says Fogleman.

Today the. Wildcats met Fur-

in many (%

places. Often a player would (AR —eame

yards before he could get off §

«}a decent kick. When the ball

hit, sometimes jt would skip ;

Crow's Candies
Forfeit Big Meet

BY MULDOON

The second annual DAVID-
SONIAN — Scrips and Pranks
croquet match was not played
last Saturday for the second
straight year.

Peter Crow's Seripts and
Pranks-ers, expected to field
an unusually weak team, were
unable even to do that. Crow,
in hiding after the campus-
wide indignation over his poor
showing (or rather lack of poor
showing), was not available for
comment to the DAVIDSON-
IAN.

Charles “Dribble” Dibble,
oustanding croquet player of
the DAVIDSONIAN staff, was
naturally disappointed that he
was not allowed to display his
personal talents in the schedul-
ed meet. Dibble, however,
coach and cantain of the news-
papermen, displayed an un-
usual amount of unselfishness
is his press conference immed-
iately following the cancelled
contest.

Before a crowd of disappoint-
ed croquet fans and a bevy
of reporters Dibble valiantly
stated, “Of course I regret
Candies didn't
show. Not so much for myself,

: but my chargers, Foetus Clark

and Fat Charlie Smith. They
were really worked up to an
emotional peak, and need!ess

ly surprised at the outcome.

“I said before Crow's Candies
wouldn't show. They knew they
could never beat us with the
mallets," Didb!e mused, ob-
viously with reverence to his
prediction which appeared in
the October 16 DAVIDSONIAN.

Says Clark, “I'd like to see
the match rescheduled for the
night of November 14; since
nothing else any good is hap-
pening then, we should get
a big crowd.”

A new standard of fine shoe value!

Syfetil Casa;

winning ways with victories
over the Pikas 33-0 and the Pi
Kapps 25-6. Tailback Dave Har.
deman combined with Thom
Blair and Dave Townsend for

most of the scoring, Skip Waite
and Whitey Lockman also turn-
ed in valuable performances.

The Betas stayed undefeated
by stopping the Pi Kapps 33-12
in their only game of the week.
Jack Sherrill continued his fine
play at tailback with scoring
tosses to top receiver, Mac Otts,
Gene Ferris and Alan Turner.

Mo Bethea set up the first
touhchdown with an. excellent
eatch on a long pass and Jim
Timmons was outstanding on
defense.

In the surprise of the weck,
the Sigma Nus defeated the
KA’s 14-13 and then continued
their rise to flickerball fame
with a 37-4 win over the Sig
Eps. Rick Fitzer again led the
Nus with pinpoint passing and
timely signal calling. Newcomer
John Mason was again outstand-
ing as a pass receiver.

The Phi Delts won their only
game of the week by a 340
margin over the Sig Eps. Terry
O'Hair and Vance Taylor shared
the passing duties and Mike
Thurman intercepted three
passes on defense.

The SAE's split two close
games to bring their season rec-
ord to 2-3. After edging the Sig
Eps 24-20, they lost to the
Sigma Chi'’s by a 20-12 score.
Mike Booe, Louis Hill, Neal Me-
Bride and Cotton Alston excell-
ed for the SAE's while Geordie
Muller and Mike Smith were
outstandjng in the Sigma Chi
victory.

The Phi Gams slipped by the
KA’s in the only other game
13-6.

Independents 42 13. The elusive
DuBose was aided by a well-
balanced offense in which ends
Larry Compton. and Tommy
Reams, center John McKinley,
and halfbacks Ray Garrison and
Joe Jelks provided most of the
action,

the first year Furman has field-
ed a team and the first time
Davidson has ever played a
Southern Conference team in
soccer.

Fogleman notes tat for next
year West Virginia has propos-
ed a round robin tournament to
decide the conference champ-
fon. The teams included would
be West Virginia, Furman, VPI,
and Davidson.
