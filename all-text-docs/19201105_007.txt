FRANCIS HENRY FRIES.

Has Done Good Work in Commer-
cial Development of N. C.

To write ‘the complete history of
Francis Henry Fries and of the affairs in
which he shared the hazard is to take
up and review the commercial progress
of North Carolina for 30 years.

Francis Henry Fries, the second son
of his honored: family, was born in
Salem, February 1, 1855. His immediate
ancestry came to this country from Sax-
ony, in 1809, with what is known as the
Moravian colony. They settled midst
‘the virgin forest in piedmont North
f¢ Carolina, under the name of Wachovia.
“Vin 1870 young Fries entered Davidson
College. He graduated from this promi-
nent seat of learning in duc course with |
distinction, and returned to his home at.
once to begin the work of his life.

‘In 1878, together with his uncle, H. W.
Fries, and his brother, H. E. Fries, he
imade an interesting voyage to Europe.
On his return from that continent, al-
, though then a young man, he took
| charge of the cotton and woolen mills
| of Salem as their superintendent. On,
ithe election of Governor Scales as Gov-
ernor of North Carolina, in 1884, Fries |
was called on to take a place on his mili-
tary staff. He accepted and served with
the rank of colonel during the four,
years’ term of his chief. '

When only 32 years of age, he should-.
ered the great burden of building and!
financing a new and independent rail- |
road system from Roanoke, Va., across |
the Blue Ridge Mountains to Winston-
Salem. With only $40,000 subscribed,
after four years of unceasing labor, it
was completed under his leadership at a-
cost of $2,000,000. Colonel Fries follow-
ed its interests until it merged into the
Norfolk & Western Railway Company,
which completed one of the most valu-
able enterprises ever undertaken by. pri-
vate citizens in the Piedmont section. ,

Then in 1893 he projected the famous .
banking house and trust company
known as the Wachovia Loan and Trust :
Company. The original capital was
$200,000, but soon this amdunt was
doubled, then another increase was |
made to its present capital stock of:
$1,333,000. Within recent years branches |
have been established in Asheville, Sal-
isbury, High Point, and Spencer. Today!
the Wachovia Bank and Trust Company |
is the largest bank in the Carolinas, with |
surplus and deposits of over $19,000,000. .
Besides being founder and president of |
this bank, Colonel Fries is president of
the Washington Banking & Trust Com- |
pany, of Fries, Va., and is a director of!
the Wachovia National Bank of Win-|
ston-Salem, N. C.

Colonel Fries is president of the May-
ho Mills, Avaton Mills, and Washington |
Mills. These three cotton mills repre-
sent a capital and surplus of $3,000,000.
Hs is at present director of the Arista
Mills, Winston-Salem; Oakdale Mills,
Jamestown, N. C., and Thistle Mills,
Ilchester, Maryland. One bale of cotton,
out of every 500 raised in the United
States; one out of every 150 used in|

|

America, or one out of every 75 used in| forceful story that goes with the best

the South is made in mills controlled by | traditions of American

Colonel Fries.

In 188: he married Letitia Walker
Patterson, daughter of Hon. Rufus L.
Patterson, who with an only daughter,
died in 1884. In 1886 he was married to
Anna de Schwinitz, and this gracious

and accomplished lady, and one daugh- |

Beautiful Ceremony Marks Mar-

ter, now compose his household. Col-
onel Fries is a member of the Moravian
Church, of Salem, N. C, and is now a
member of the board of elders of the
Home Moravian Church.

His last great achievement was to
build the Winston-Salem Southbound
Railway Company from Winston-Salem
to Charleston, S. C., across the N. & W.,
Southern, A.C. L. and S. A. L. railroads.
His life work reads the strong and

r* :

Joseph Powell Watkins, '13, was
struck by an automobile at Hen-
derson, N. C, the blow causing
concession of the brain, from
which he died on Sunday, October
24. The daily papers state that he
was, helping a blind man across

the street and so failed to see the
approaching car.

He entered Davidson with the
class of 1912, but the condition of
his eyes made it necessary for
them to have complete rest for a
year between his Sophomore and
Junior years, so he graduated in
1913. In spite of his handicaps he
was a thorough and excellent stu-
dent, and stood for everything that
was upright and honorable. His
affection and interest here center-
ed around the Young Men's Chris-
tian Association and the Philan-
thropic Society. After his gradu-
ation his loyalty and love for the
college has been shown in scores
of ways.

He completed the course at
Union Theological Seminary in
1916, but was never able to go into
the active ministry. It is stated
that when being examined for en-
trance into the Presbytery, some
one put a test question: “How
about it, if when your training is
finished you should be unable to
preach?” His reply was, “That
would break my heart,” and only

his closest friends knew how sore
a heart he carried his last four
years, or how keenly he felt the
burden of the world’s need.

He took up outdoor life, how-
ever, and gave himself heartily to
the forms of Christian work that
lay at hand, and were within his
power. It was the characteristic
thing for him to be helping some-
one who needed help, and there is
added pathos in his going, that his
last act was lending aid to one
who could not sec.

In the death of Joe Watkins, Da-
vidson and the Presbyterian
Church lost a true and devoted
son,

business and
gives significance to American progress.
The splendid achievements of this re-
markable man may be but forerunners
of greater achievements yet to come.
