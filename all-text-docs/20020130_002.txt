70% standard in all areas.

In the 2000 report, only two houses man-
aged to pass in all areas. Moore called this
change a “drastic improvement.”

The report’s pass-fail standard is not an
empty ranking; failure in one or more areas
carries stiff consequences for the house in-
volved. A house that does not measure up to

“the 70% minimum standard in one area must
‘submit a plan detailing steps that will be

taken to improve the deficiency. Failure i in
two or more areas carries a penalty of social
probation. The more categories failed, the
longer the probation. A house that fails in
four or more areas will have its presence on
campus evaluated by CCRL.

Moore singled out Finances as an area of
great improvement, pointing out that “more

and more organizations are moving out of
debt” and projecting that all organizations
will be out of debt by 2003.

Faculty/Staff Relations was another area in
which Moore saw an upward trend; article
submissions to the Davidsonian and faculty
events at the houses have both increased.

The report was not all good news, however.
Several houses fell short of the average cam-
pus GPA; both Warner Hall and SAE failed to
meet standards in this area.
The report acknowledges that
many of the Patterson Court
organizations need torefocus |
their academic efforts this
coming semester.

Additionally, Service ac-
tivities have seen a mild de-
cline since the 2000 report,
and Moore encouraged orga-
nizations to reaffirm their
commitment to the Service
aspects of Patterson Court.

Finally, the report indicates
that violations on the Court
are, unfortunately, not on the
decline. “Several organiza-
tions are committing ‘repeat
offenses’ and are not correct-
ing their mistakes. Risk Man-
agement Policies and cam-
pus alcohol awareness need
to be addressed and possibly
revised and strengthened by
the Patterson Court Council.”

Even with the minor dark
spots in the report, however,
Moore concluded with the
optimistic observation that the
Standards Program is “evolv-
ing in a favorable direction.”
He expressed hope that the
incoming Chancellor, Nancy
Kohler ’03, would be able to
hold the houses on the Court
to an even higher standard.

Diplomat addresses Taiwan’s role
in international community

By Emi_ty Drew
Senior Staff Writer

“Taiwan is totally free, totally democratic.
But, that does not mean that we do not have
problems,” said Taiwanese representative C.J.
Chen during his recent lecture entitled “Tai-
wan and its Relations with the U.S. and
Mainland China.” Chen highlighted Taiwan’s
economic and political achievements, while
also stressing the importance of cross-cul-
tural integration and understanding.

Chen is head of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office in Washing-
ton, D.C., which maintains economic rela-
tions between Taiwan and the U.S. in lieu of
formal diplomatic relations between the two
countries. 7

After an introduction by Dr. Shelley Rig-
ger (Brown Associate Professor of East Asian
Politics) Chen took the podium in the Smith
900 Room. He first described Taiwan’s
history and it’s accomplishments, and later,
he focused on Taiwanese international rela-
tions with both the People’s Republic of
China (PRC) and the U.S. He presented the
positive accomplishments of the Taiwanese
people, and explained the negative issues
facing the island as it struggles to maintain
its identity among precarious international
relationships.

“We constantly ask ourselves, ‘How can
we improve our relations with the PRC?
How can we improve the status of Taiwan in
the International Community?” said Chen.
“Taiwan has been improving qualitatively.

Still, we are not happy. We believe we can
achieve more.”

Chen said that Taiwan’s democratization
began about 15 years ago, and has allowed for
exciting economic growth and political ac-
complishments. He noted that Taiwan’s GNP
increased from $1 Billion to $320 billion in
only 50 years, and he also expressed pride ina
speedy democratization process of only about
15 years.

“Taiwan has the 46" largest population in
the world, and the 138" largest land area.
However, out economy is ranked 16", he
said. “This is mostly due to the hard-work of
our people.”

“Their entrepreneurial outlook is part of
