THE CONTEMPTIBLE SPIRIT.

The spirit that, was evinced by some
of the students in church Sunday morn-
ing was utterly mean and contemptible,
and totally unworthy of the true spirit
claimed by Davidson. Nor can it be
excused by the worn phrase ‘“thought-
lessness,”’ for the same men heard the
same question thrashed thru last year,
and in this, his most plastic age, when

present acts tend to become future traits],

of character, the young man has no busi-
ness with thoughtlessness.

The height of discourtesy was shown
in disturbing and attempting to call
down «a guest. That such conduct
should occur in the House of God show-
ed utter lack of reverence. Men who
alone, or in front, would not have
dared make a disturbance, but taking

advantage of numbers, kicked the
benches or tinkled watches, branded
themselves as contemptible cowards.

And he who cannot sit quietly for thir-
ty-five minutes, whatever the  circum-
stances, is cither childish or utterly
mean,

What ,is the use of Davidson adver-
tising her fair name, or her football
team winning, if she is going to give
serself a black eye by mistreating visiting
ministers from whose congregations the
future students must come.

The men who are guiltv of such a
spirit are fully as contemptible as those
who cheat on examinations, and should
receive like treatment.

THE COLLEGE MUSEUM.

Thus reads the
Catalogue:

“There is a supply of tables, gas, and
other apparatus necessary for practical
work in Mineralogy as well as Geology.
In addition, the department has at its
disposal the splendid cabinets of rocks.

sils, and eleven hundred recent shells:
there ‘was added, by donation, about
fifteen hundred minerals; and also
‘ollection of shells given by former
State Geologist Kerr. The whole con
sists of over ten thousand specimens.”

Let us pay this remarkable place :
We enter Chambers’ colossal
halls. The museum doors are locked
forsooth, and a passer-by kindly inform:

Sut we will not be balked. We seek a
ianitor and a key and enter. Behold
the “splendid cabinets.” Their only
fault, where the glass is not broken, ts
that they are so thickly laden with dust
that we cannot see thru the glass.
remove some of the real estate and peer
within. Sure enough, there are the
fossils and rocks, that have been “ac-
cumulating for fifty years.” From ap-
oearances they have been accumulating
dust for fifty years. Some have labels,
some have two, some have none. On
the shelves wre shoe boxes, match boxes
and other recepticles containing rare fos-
sils and valuable minerals in delightful
variety. On the floor are broken pieces,
the remains of a battle long since van-
ished into the dimming past. And _fin-
ally we pick our way amid cobwebs and
dust, over rubbish, to the door.

We ugree that the college in its pres-
to cither
build a new museum or spend large
sums in fixing up the old one, but an
occasional visit from a janitor would be
neither expensive nor unprofitable. The
geology class would find plenteous work
in readjusting and restoring the labels.
And if there should be a set date for
opening it, some interest might be taken
in it by the students,

MRS. A. B. YOUNG.

Mrs. A. B. Young, of Davidson, one
of the oldest and best beloved women
of the county, died at the Charlotte
Sanatorium, Sunday night at to o'clock,
after an illness that had continued for
the past several weeks. She was 68
vears of age and is survived by two
daughters, Misses Lizzie Craige Young

and Mary Erwin Young. ‘The funeral | ggginemenmmmnennn

took place in Concord, from the home .
of Mrs. Allison, a sister of the deceased, By theirFRUITS ye

vesterday at. noon. The services were
conducted by Dr. Richards, assisted by
Rev. Dr. Grier, of Concord.

Mrs. Young was Miss Mary Eliza-
beth Craige before her marriage, the
daughter of the late Burton and Eliza-
beth Craige. The greater part of her
life was spent in Concord, where she
had innumerable friends and admirers.
She moved to Davidson several years
ago, and resided here until taken to
Charlotte for treatment several weeks
ago. She was a devoted and loyal mem-
ber of the Davidson Presbyterian church
and was well known for her many bene-
factions.

DAVIDSON-CAROLINA GAME.
REMAINS IN WINSTON

For the present, at least, this import-
ant game on Davidson's schedule is to
be played in Winston. Manager Reese
has stated that all rumors to the con-
trary are unfounded. However, it must
not be denied that Charlotte gives a
strong bid for the game to be played on
Wearn Field. The alumni and football
enthusiasts of Charlotte have always
shown their lovalty and interest by
turning out a large delegation to the
support of the Red and Black machine.
Again, the proximity of the city to Dav-
idson and its population give additional
attractiveness to their offer. The propo-
sition certainly deserves thoughtful con-
sideration. On the other hand, the two
games in Charlotte and the evident ad-
vantages of the game in Winston should
be taken into account.
