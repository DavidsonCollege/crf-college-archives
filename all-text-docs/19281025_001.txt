Morning Address

“Our Father” was the subject of the
message delivered by Dr. Thompson Mon-
day evening in Shearer Hall.

Matthew 6:9, which is the opening
petition in the Lord’s Prayer, was the
speaker’s text. The fact that we
“Our Father” as we kneel in prayer is
striking evidence of the solidarity of
the human family and the interdependence
of its members. We are not experiment-
ing with our lives as in separate test tubes
in the laboratory of life, but we are work-
ing our fate out in common,

say

A man, especially a young man, often
feels that his life is his own to live, and
that if he is willing to take the penalty for
its mismanagement, it will fall on him
alone. But he forgets the loved ones
looking to him and idealizing him; he
cannot fail without hurting them.

All of this great human family is living
for better or for worse; if we fall, re-
gardless of our humble position on campus
or in village someone will be influenced
by it. We may even exert this influence
unconsciously as an English writer has
said, “No man can pass another on the
street without making a mark on the soul
of that man.”

“Tam part of all that I have met”
expresses a like idea; your contribution
has a direct influence in shaping the course
of civilization. The man who thinks he
can live alone is a fool, blind to the fate
of his life. :

“As we look up into the face of ‘Our
Father’ and find there the same love and
mercy which Christ showed to men, we
realize that truly here is the Father of
the great human family. You can't live
your life alone; without Him you can't
succeed,”

“Being rightly related to all persons and
to God through Jesus Christ,” was the
definition of religion given by Dr. Thomp-
son in a chapel address Monday morning.

In discussing man’s relation to God, the
speaker decried those who belittle the
value of thought in comparison with
acts. The thought of the German people
as directed by their educational leaders
was ripened into the acts of the World
War with all its suffering.

Does it not matter then how that: people
think about God? What do we really
know about God? Are we like many sol-
diers in the World War who, though
church members, declared that they didn’t
know God as revealed in the person of
Jesus Christ ? :

Then, a proper relation toward God
includes a right feeling toward Him. A
man may have a cold intellectual con-
ception of God which does not rouse him
to admiration and love, but could that
be called religion? A man’s faith, hope
and love are the feelings upon which Paul
bases a major portion of his Christian
belief.

Finally, a man must go further than
thought feeling; he must will aright in
relation God. _ The imperatives of
Jesus are given in a straighforward man-
ner to the wills of men: Are we to yield
our wills to His?

Eta Sigma Phis Are
Formally Installed

Members of Chapter at Winthrop
Officiate at Installation

A chapter of Eta Sigma Phi, on
Tuesday night, October 23, was estab-
lished in Davidson College, by mem-
bers of that order, from the chapter at
Winthrop College. Though there are
17 men who weré to have been
initiated at the installation of the
chapter, two men, prominent mem-
bers of the order, were absent: Rusk,
and Dr. Harding. *

Three ladies, two from the student
body and one on the faculty of Win-
throp, officiate at the ceremaqnies. The
member of the faculty is Dr. Martin,
the head of the Latin and Greek de-
partment. The young ladies were,
Miss Mary Ethel Owen, who is the
president of the Winthrop chapter;
and Miss Dorothy Gilwreath, Secre-
tary and Treasurer of the same chap-
ter. Lest it seem strange that the in-
stallation of a chapter in a boys’ col-
lege be performed by representatives
from a girls’ chapter, it must be ex-
plained that the Winthrop chapter is
the nearest one of the order. There
is also a chapter in the University. of
South Carolina. But these two and
the newly installed one, are the only
chapters in this section of the Suoth.

The old officers serving when the
organization was only the Classical
club, will continue to serve; filling
their former duties, though answer-
ing to new names.

In Towa City, Iowa the petition of
the Classical Club was last spring
granted. The Classical club had been
in existence for only a year, when it
decided to petition this fraternity
which has some thirty-odd chapters in
the country.

Executive Committee to Control
Affairs of Three Musical
Organizations Here

At a meeting of the Glee Club Friday
night a constitution and by-laws for the
club, which had been presented by the
president at a previous?meeting, was
voted upon and unanimously passed. This
constitution recognizes, the Glee Club As-
sociation which was formed recently by
the officers of the two orchestras and the
Glee Club. The three organizations will
thus be under one control, the executive
committee of the association, and will be
enabled to work together
smoothly than ever before.

Through the efforts of Professor Cul-
lum, the club will have much better facili-
ties for practice than previously. Here-
tofore the Glee Club has practiced in
Shearer Hall, but a large room on the first
floor of Eu Hall has been gtted out for
the club and will be ready for use as
soon as the installation of the electric
fixtures is completed. This will make a
splendid club room and will also be much
more suitable for
Shearer Hall.

The quartet for the club this year has
been selected and will consist of: First
tenor, J. E. Bradley; second tenor, C. B.
Peterson; baritone, E. Z. DuBose; bass,
C. K. Poole.

Professor Cullum stated that the songs
for the elub this year would be even richer
in harmony and contrasts than last year's
numbers. The repertoire of the club will
include the following pieces :

Break Forth, O Beauteous
Bach.

O Bona Jesu—Palestrina.

God Is My Guide—Schubert.

Annie Laurie—Geibel.

Sylvia—Speaks.

Wireless Report of
Game Is Sucessful

Davidson's gymnasium was a scene of
intense interest Saturday afternoon as the
Davidson-Citadel game was received by
radio. The play-by-play reception over
ether was sponsored by the Physics De-
partment of the College. The set belong-
ing to that department was used for the
Davidson station, and was operated by S.
L. McCarty, prominent member of the
senior class.

The Charleston was hastily
erected in the stadium at Citadel,, with a
transmitter belonging to the Charlotte
Radio Club and a receiver belonging to
Station 4 A A M, Charleston. This end
was operated by R. B. Hayes, of the
senior class, as game reporter; Edward
Bettis, of the freshman class, as sender,
and T. W. Zeigler, operator of Station
4A A M, controlling the receiver.

Station 4CQ, Charleston (Hayes, Beat-
tis and Zeigler) was ready for operation
but a few minutes before the kick-off,
while 4DB (McCarty) had been trying
since 10 a. m. to make connections.
Chaleston was finally heard just after the
signal QST, a signal for attention from
every station, was sent.

On account of a delinquent receiving
set at Charleston and a poorly equipped
sending set at Davidson, the only words
received from McCarty were: “4DB, go
ahead.” At the end of the half, thinking
the messages were not being received,
Charleston asked 4ADF, at Henderson-
vil'e, to relay the words. 4ADF tried to
get Davidson, but on account of Mc-
Carty'’s listening for Charleston _ this
proved unsuccessful.

Failure to give players’ names making
the runs was due to a code system devised
by the operators, that would enable the
players’ names to be given in two letters

TAP DAY SET ON
TUESDAY, OCT..30

The dignified and impressive Tap Day
program of the Delta Circle of Omicron
Delta Kappa, national honorary leadership
fraternity, will be solemnized on Tuesday
morning, October 30, in the presence’ of
the entire student body. It has been the
custom of the local chapter for the past
few years to hold two bid days each ses-
sion of college, one in the fall and the
other in the spring. At this time mem-
hers of the senior class who have distin-
guished themselves in some
phase of college activities are invited to
membership in O. D. K. The president
of the local organization customarily pre-

as leaders

sides over the exercises. A faculty mem-
ber of O. D. K. will probably make a
short speech preceding the bidding. The
bidding itself is performed in a very cere-
monious manner. Some member of the
organization comes from the stage and
with a tap upon the shoulder invites the
newly bid member to follow him to the
stage, where he is welcomed by the
officers.

Tap Day has grown to be a time of
great interest and importance at the col-
lege. The ceremony used by this cirele
is not common to the entire organization
but has been inaugurated by several other
circles. Omicron Delta Kappa was or-
ganized at Washington and Lee College in
1914 and has had such success in so short
a time that it is now a national organiza-
tion and comprises about 34 circles. "Phe |
Delta Circle of Davidson College was
founded in 1917, only three years after
O. D. K. came into existence.

The present members of Omicron Delta
Kappa are A. N, Brown, J. R. Coving-
M. T. Gilmour, J, W. Melton, M.
M. King, and R. FE. Kell, together with 11
faculty members and Coaches Younger
and Mattox. This enrollment will be in-
creased by about five or six men from the
senior class on Bid Day. Shortly after
Tap Day the public and private initia-
tions will be held. The circle always pro-
vides excellent speakers for the public
initiation and the students and towns-
people are invited to this function.

Thompson Delivers
Speech at Vespers

That “God is not mocked, whatsoever a
man soweth, that shall he also reap,” is
substantiated and upheld by modern psy-
chology, according to, Dr. Tolly Thompson
in his address Sunday night at the “Y”
vespers.

Summoning evidence from a wide range
of poets, novelists, philosophers and psy-
chologists, the speaker showed that, in
the parlome of the street, ‘a man can't
win” through a life of immorality. The
law of man may be transgressed with im-
punity often, but there is a deeper law
wrought in the very fiber of our beings
that cannot be escaped. Our own natures
are under the law of cause and effect.
Every silghtest stroke of virtue or of vice
leaves never so slight a scar.

People see things from a different point
of view as determined by their past ex-
perience. Old memories of certain cir-

often such. influences
on a person that they are powerless to
cease thinking about them or to resist
their impetus to action. ‘Not what might
have been,” cries Byron in support of the

above facts.

cumstances exert

The tomorrow of sin is a little worse
than today, for sin, the most divisive thing
in the world, erects a barrier between God
and us. To know that we have deterior-
ated and are not worthy of the praise and
esteem of others, is not this Hell? “I
have to live with myself forever,” de-
clared Churchill.

tions Are Bid

INITIATION IN DECEMBER

Gilmour, Graham, Dumas, Kane,
Pritchett, and Moriarity, of
Senior Class Receive Bids

The Davidson chapter of Phi Beta
| Kappa, North Carolina Gamma, has an-
| nounced the extension of bids to six mem-
| bers of the senior class who have ex-
hibited unusual scholastic excellence dur-
ing the three past years. The six men

Tennessee.

Initiation ceremonials have been set for
December, the exact time and program not
yet ready for announcement,

Phi Beta Kappa is perhaps the best
known and most highly respected of the
honorary college fraternities, and has be-
come firmly embedded in American col-
lege life with its traditions and ideals of
high scholastic attainment. This honorary
fraternity was founded in 1776 at William
and Mary College and is acknowledged as
the oldest organization of its type. At
the present time 107 colleges throughout
the United States have chapters of Phi
Beta Kappa.

In honoring these men, the Davidson
chapter has selected six leaders of able
character. Monroe T. Gilmour is presi-
dent ‘of the senior class, member of the
International Club, Court of
Control, and Philanthropic Literary So-
ciety.

Relations

He is also active in journalistic
fields, being a member of the annual staff
and of the Reporters’ Club. He is a mem-
ber of Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fra-
ternity.

J. Reid Graham is a member of the
Eumanean Literary Society and has sery-
ed as intercollegiate and inter-class de-
bater. In his freshman year he was award-
ed the Alumni medal for
reaching the highest average in his class,
| He is a member of Alpha Phi Epsilon
honorary fraternity, the Classical Club,
and the International Relations Club.

Lawrence Dumas, a member of Phi
Gamma Delta social fraternity, is business
manager of the 1929 Quips and Cranks,
member of the Debating Team, and is a
member of Eumanean Literary Society.
He plays scrub football and is on the var-
sity track squad.

Association

He is also a member of
Alpha Phi Epsilon honorary fraternity.

R. R. Kane not only has distinguished
himself as a consistent honor roll stndent_
but is recognized as a very popular mem-
ber of his class. He has held class of-
fices, is a candidate for the varsity foot-
ball squad, and is a member of Beta Theta
Pi fraternity,

W. K. Pritchett has distinguished him-
self as a speaker, writer, and student. He
is president of the Honorary Fraternity
Council, member of Alpha Phi Epsilon,
Delta Pi Kappa, and International Rela-
tions Club. He was winner of the fresh-

Lights In Dormitory
Will Not Be Cut Off

Plan to be Tried by College Au-
thorities as Experiment

In a recent meeting of the faculty com-
mittee of the college it was decided that
the lights in the dormitories be left on all
night.

It has been the custom in the past, dur-
ing a long period of years, to cut off the
lights in the dormitories shortly after 12
o'clock, consequently, the new plan ap-
pears in the form of an innovation.

This action is to be permanent, pro-
vided that the students do not abuse the
privilege. The lights are not left on to
accommodate those who like to “bull” un-
til 11 or 12 o'clock and then get in an
hour or two of belated studyirig; but rath-
er to accommodate the occasional man
who has extra work to do, to provide
light by which the late comer can get to
bed, and to aid anyone who may become
sick during the night.

It was decided to leave the lights on
only after careful consideration on the
part of the faculty committee, and it is
understood that the privilege will be
promptly taken away unless used in the
