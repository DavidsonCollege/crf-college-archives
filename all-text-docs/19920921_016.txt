#3 Duke Manages Tie
Against 20th Ranked 'Cats

By Charles Wyrick
On Wednesday
night, September 16, in
front of a crowd of in-
vigorated seniors and
other spirited fans that
made the tripto Durham,
the Davidson soccer
team played Duke in an
exciting game that
ended in stalemate.
After overtime the
score remained bound
at 0-0. Though they
failed to score, the Wild-
cats controlled all as-
pects of the game. It was
a strong game for the
‘Cats and a powerful
example of their ability
to work the ball as a team.
Throughout the game,
Davidson controlled the midfield.
Defense led by seniors Craig Omli
and Cliff Castelloe set the pace of
the game, transforming Duke’s
offensive attempts into new

Davidson attacks. Passing in the

midfield was quick and precise as
the Wildcats worked through
Duke’s defense.

Davidson had several scoring
chances in regulation time, the best
of which was Matt Spear’s first-
half penalty kick. Spear sent his

Volleyball Dominates
UNC-Greensboro Tournament

By Taylor Smith

The Davidson volleyball team
enjoyed a successful week, win-
ning four of the five matches that
they played. The week began with
a home-court win against
Winthrop, the Wildcats winning in
three games, 15-3, 15-9, 16-14.

The team had just returned
from a difficult tournament at Vir-
ginia Commonwealth, in which it
had not played exceptionally well.
“We used the VCU tournament as
something of a laboratory, experi-
menting with different lineups to
see what would work best for us”
said head coach Carolyn Blake.

“Sometimes it seems as if our con-
centration is there, and we play
well, such as tonight,” Blake con-
tinued. “Thatis what we were look-
ing for at VCU, our best lineup.”

The winning continued in
Greensboro at the UNCG tourna-
ment this weekend. Senior
Catherine Milligan, making the
most of a position change to out-
side hitter, led the Wildcats in a
hard-fought for win against UNC
Wilmington, 12-15, 15-11, 15-11,
15-12, by hitting .356 with 10kills.

the goal, but the Duke
keeper guessed right and
was able to punch the ball

Davidson’s momeh-
tum lasted into the sec-
ond, 15-minute overtime,
when it looked like their
efforts would produce a
winning shot. With nine
minutes left, Zack
Eastman fired ashotfrom
outside the box that re-
bounded off the cross-
bar.

Then, inside of two
minutes, Rob Ukrop, ina
break away, shot just to
the left of the goal.
Though victory remained elusive,
the game was well played. In the
words of senior midfielder Preston
Yarborough, the game was “not a
true victory buta moral one. We’ve
got bigger and better things to
come.”

Women and Men's X-Country

Place Well at Winthrop Invitational
Grisez Leads Women Again to Third

By Pete Hurtado

The women’s cross country
team overcame extremely hot and
humid conditions Saturday to place
third among twenty teams at the
Winthrop Invitational in Rock Hill,
S.C. In the processs, they sent a
message to several conference ri-
vals, and finished just 38 points
behind powerful Furman.

Freshman standout Marie
Grisez continued her impressive
season, placing 6th among some
135 runners at 20:09 for five kilo-
meters. Grisez ranks among the
Southern Conference’s best.

Close behind Grisez were
sophomores Elizabeth Bishop (9th,
20:31) and Carolyn Meadows
(11th, 20:35). Bishop went out fast

Themen’scross-country team
overcame the harsh heat and hu-
midity Saturday to place a respect-
able ninth of 24 teams at the
Winthrop Invitational in Rock Hill,
S.C. :
Senior Ian Stewart continued
to make a name for himself among
the Southern Conference elite,
placing 16th out of some 180 ath-
letes at 27:49 for five miles.
Stewart’s time last week at ASU
ranks him 10th among all South-
ern Conference harriers.

Junior Richard Wharton ran a
smart race, running a steady pace
to place 31st at 28:44 for the Wild-
cats. Senior Pete Hurtado followed
at 39th (29:01).

The harsh conditions in Rock
Hill were too much for the rest of
the “Cats. Yet Erik McMichael
(60th), David Kerns (77th), and
Joe Beach (83rd) still managed to
finish well into the upper half of
the field.

The squad still was only four
places behind conférence rivals
Furman and three places behind
VMI. Coach Gary Andrew was
optimistic, hoping that his harriers
have learned to adjust to poor
weather conditions.

Next week, Davidson’s top
five runners will travel to New
York City for the Hunter College
Invitational at Van Cortlandt Park

in the Bronx.

Ukrop Notches

50th Goal of Career
Reaches Mark Before
Davidson Crowd vs. USC

By Bruce Balestier

It must be the mark of a great
player that he can-score the 50th
goal of his career in two different
places. Davidson senior forward
Rob Ukrop thoughthe had recorded
number 50 in his hometown of
Richmond September 11, when he
scored from 20 yards out 17 min-
utes into the ‘Cats’ 4-0 win over
Fairleigh-Dickinson. Actually, that
was number 51. After looking at a
television replay of Davidson’s 2-
2 tie with South Carolina two days

Carlier, the game-tying goal in over-

time, originally attributed to Cliff
Castelloe, was given to Ukrop, and
went in the books as his 50th.
Ukrop was decidedly low-key
about the milestone. “Fifty is a
nice number, but it’s still just that,
a number,” he said. “The impor-
tant thing was that it tied the game
for us against a good South Caro-
lina team. It [the 50-goal mark]
will probably mean more to me a

few years down the road.” He did
most of his scoring work two years
ago in his junior season, when he
scored 22 goals and finished third
in the nation in scoring.
Davidson coach Charlie
Slagle, though, made it clear thatit
is the rare and gifted player who
makes it 50 goals. “It may be justa
number, butit’s anumber that very _
few people have,” he said.
Through six games this year,
Ukrop’s seven goals and one assist
rank him fourth_in the nation-in
scoring, just one goal off the na-
tional lead. Senior midfielder Matt
Spear’s five assists place him first
in the nation in that category. The
importance of the returnof Ukrop’s’
scoring tothis year’s team cannot
be overestimated. The 1991 team
finished with 55 points. This year’s
team has 44 points barely a quarter
through the season, and was on
pace last week to finish with 172
points.
