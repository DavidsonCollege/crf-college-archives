Anexploration of J apanese haiku

“All night on a flute.”
By SUDEEP SEN

The Japanese psyche is today
a popular subject for parlor dis-
cussion and serious study. But we
cannot understand the minds of
these people from temperate Asia
without some knowledge of their

‘ cultural roots.

What emerges from such an
inquiry is that the Japanese have
two sides to their character: on the
one hand, they are industrious
people, sincere and seriuos in
their belief and in their work; on
the other hand, they are a nation
nurtured in artistic and cultural
traditions. They are sensitive to

beauty. Their literature, their.

paintings, their gardens bear tes-
timony to this.

Not many, however, have had
the opportunity to drink from the
nectar bowl of their literature. It
might appear unfamiliar and,

Out and About

therefore, baffling when one first
reads haiku, the popular form of
poetry from Japan.

To the Westerner it is an exo-
tic form of verse. But for me as an
Indian these 17-syllabic creations
are familiar enough. We have our
Urdu couplets, and even the four-

liné poems of Tagore, But the .

haiku’s similarity with our poetry
starts and ends with size.

It is the content and not really
the size of the haiku that deter-

mines its unique character. Invari- .

ably, it has as its nucleus one of
the four seasons — spring, sum-

mer, autumn or winter. The sea- .

sons’s name may not always be
mentioned; often a key word or re-
ference makes it identifiable.
Built around this seed is the
flesh comprising descriptions of
life, nature and humar beings, the
ingredients of most poetry. What
gives it an unusual flavor is that

the haiku leaves much unsaid:
“When the autumn wind
Scatters peonies,

A few petals fall in pairs.”

— Buson

The ‘haiku’ started as the first
three lines of the ‘tanka’, a poem
of five lines composed by two
people as a sort of literary game.
One person composed the first
three. lines; the poem was then
completed by the other. Eventu-
ally the first portion of the tanka
gained popularity as a separate
verse form.

Even in the original Japanese,
the haiku has no end-rhymes. Of
the’ 17-syllables, the first and the
third lines have five syllables
each. Within these narrow con-
fines sometimes the haiku brings
together two apparently different
ideas, such as here:

“For a lovely bowl

Let us arrange these flow-

ers...
Since there is no rice.”

— Basho

For a better understanding of

the haiku, we must appreciate the.

influence of Zen Buddhism and its

philosophy on the poets. Reading

haikus gives the distinct impres-
sion that they are exquisite crys-
tallisations of very sharp and ac-
curate observations of the world
around the poet. It should be
realized that only those trained to
switch on the mind as a receiver
would be capable of reading such
insights into everyday schemes.

The greatest acknowledged
haiku poet — Basho, a contempo-
rary of the seventeenth century —
was a student of Zen B uddhism in
his later years. His Zen-training
yielded gems as:

“My eyes following

Until the bird was lost at sea

Found a small island.”

The charm of the haiku lies in
the fact that in spite of the narrow
constraints of its form and con-
tent, it is able to convey a whole
range of emotions and images,
leaving enough unsaid to lead the
reader to complete the canvas with
his or her experiences. Some of
the best haikus, of course, des-
cribe nature in its purest form.
Here is one example:

“One fallen flower returning
to the branch?

... Ohno!

A white butterfly.”

— Maritake

An observer of the world can-
not but be struck occasionally by
the sheer illogic and unpredicta-
bility of human nature:

“Don’t touch my plum-tree!

Said my friend, and saying so

Broke the branch for me.”

— Taigi

Southpark and Eastland offer dining variety

By JESSICA FISHER and DIANA
MILLER

Shopping and snacking are symbioti¢
activities. Parent’s Weekend has hope-
fully replenished your checking ac-
counts, and this week is a good time to
use the money for that badly needed
wardrobe makeover. Southpark mall,
Eastland mall, and the Uptown area mall
all provide excellent dining to compli-
ment your purchasing excursions.

While in Southpark take time out to
lunch at the Belk’s gourmet section on
the lower level of the store. This section
includes a full deli, bakery, and restau-
rant. The restaurant, open for lunch from
11 a.m. to 3 p.m., features gourmet edi-
bles at moderate prices. Two items which
appealed to us were the roast beef and
brie croissant sandwich and the fresh
poached salmon. The prices range from
three to seven dollars.

___On the way out stop at the bakery and __ food. Lunch i is. se

pick up some fresh baked bread or French

p.m. You can either opt for an entree

late night post-party munchies.

If your dining tastes are of a more
continental style, Charlie’s restaurant,
also in Southpark, provides an alternate
lunching location for the discriminating
epicure. The atmosphere is quaint and the
menu is broad. The horticultural. decor
and coordinating . green and white
checked table cloths create a comfortable
ambiance. The varied lunch menu is
composed of such dishes as chili nacho
salad, eggs florentine, fettucini primav-
era, and bacon cheeseburger, and the
prices are consistently about five dollars.
Charlie’s opens at 11:30 for lunch and re-
mains open throughout the afternoon.

Nohow and contrariwise

It’s never too early to think about X-mas

By STEVE MANK

Sure it may seem a littléearly to start
writing about Christmas, but you can
never prepare too early for one of the
most sacred days in the Christian reli-
gion.

I have received countless letters re-
cently from folks just like you who seek

-| my advice concerning the holidays, so in

this, my first holiday column, I will an-
swer some of them.
Dear Mr. Christmas,

Around our house the birth of the

- Lord has special significance. We like to
read from Scripture and sing hymns. On
Christmas Eve,,everyone sits around the
fireplace and talks about the meaning of
this very special day for them. My ques-
tion is this: for these loving times, should

I wear my red dress or my white one?
Also, does God prefer silver or gold?

Saved but Savvy
Dear Saved,

Nothing goes better with sacred mo-
ments of familial bonding than a simple,
white, Laura Ashley and matching
pumps. May I also suggest a gold, dia-

eat luncheon buffet for a mere $4.50. The
buffet includes create-your-own tacos,

taquitas, tostatos and other tasty mexican
dishes. The mud pie, fried ice cream, and
sopapillas are delectable possibilities for
the consummation of the-meal.

Incontrast, Anabelle’s, located with-
in Eastland mall, appeals to the more
conventional diner. Anabelle’s opens for
lunch at 11:30 and remains epen until
midnight. The menu consists primarily of
sandwiches, italian dishes such as
lasagna, and salads and the prices stay at
about $5. -—

If the Uptown Area mall lures you
into its clutches, stop in Sweetbay or
Chatfield’s. Both restaurants are located
in the Marriot Civic Center. Sweetbay
has tables outside of the restaurant itself,.

Dear Mr. Christmas,

What’s this business about Santa see-
ing me when I’m sleeping? Frankly, 1.

Disgusted in Deluth

_-Dear Mr. Christmas, _

I'm afraid my husband did not have
too successful a year. We'd like to give
our eight year old, Tad, a toy gun but we
just don’t think we can afford it. Can you
help us? _—

Dear In,

Not only does he see you when you’ re
sleeping, but he severely punishes snotty
brats like you for their impertinence.
Dear Mr. Christmas,

We so loved Burl Ives in “Santa
Claus is Coming to Town.” Will he be
doing any more specials?

The Holts

-Dear the Holts,
. Mr. Ives has sadly fallen to a career __

mosphere of a European cafe. A typical

-buffet style lunch offers such dishes as

lasagna, eggplant parmesan, steamed
vegetables, garlic bread, soup, and salad

and includes a delicious dessert buffet for
$7. One possibility is to choose to forgo
the full buffet and enjoy only the delecta-
ble dessert bar for $3. The blueberry pie,
Bavarian tortes, French pastries, apple
and peach cobblers with fresh whipped
cream all are_perfect compliments to your |.
afternoon tea or coffee. Both the buffet
and the dessert bar are offered from 11
a.m. to 3 p.m. on Monday through Satur-.
day. While some may prefer the all-you-
can-eat lunch and dessert buffet offered
at Sweetbay, Chatfield’s provides a
lighter fare. Chatfield’s serves primarily
a deli sandwich, soup, and salad lunch
which costs about $5. On pleasant after-
noons the outdoor veranda is open. So
bypass that Chick-fil-a, and opt for some
of the finer culinary experiences offered
by the Charlotte area.

Dear Mr. Christmas,

A few years ago you printed a poem.
from a dead boy in heaven to his mother.
In it, the boy talked about keeping the
Christmas spirit all year long. I believe it
was called “Mama, Merry Christmas.”
Can you reprint it?

Dear Woman,

No. In our next special Christmas

then, keep buyin’.
