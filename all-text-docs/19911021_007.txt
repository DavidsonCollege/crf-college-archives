Questionin' That: What Does Knowledge & Learning Mean?

Our two anonymous students
meet in the BSC for their not-so-bi-
weekly discussion. For those who
don't know the time, that stands
for Baker Sports Complex. Were
you all by chance thinking that
stood for something else?

A: Whatdoes knowledge and learn-
ing mean?

J: Funny you should ask me that, I
just came from giving a lecture on
that very topic. Butseriously, folks,
is this a trick question?

A: Look around. Aren’t there so-
cial, economic and political prob-
lems out there?

J: I suppose so. I’m flat broke
(economic), and I can’t get a date
(social). What are you getting at
(political)?

A: Your situation isn’treally what
I’m referring to. With the excep-
tion of the date part, all of that will
likely change. The United States is
arich nation by modern standards,

but there are still homeless, illiter-
ate, and impoverished people in
America. In getting what you want
in this world, it seems that you
have to take something from some-
one else, particularly if you take
more than you want or need? I
mean, aren’t we learning to do this
here and now?

J: Well, the recruiters told me that
the reason to come to Davidson
was to become a well-rounded
renaissance man. However, now
that I think about it, the underlying
purpose of this institution is to
prepare individuals to make a way
for themselves in this world, even
if itis at the expense of others. But
isn’t that the American way? Or,
perhaps the “western” way, if you
know what! mean? Ican’tbe sure;
I haven’t been given anything to
compare it to.

A: That’s the whole point. Think
of society as a machine and indi-
viduals as parts. If wé accept with-

-out question the principles of

western culture, don’t we become

Depth! Relevance!

Everyone Has An Off

Boy am _ I _- stumped.
Hmmmmm. Drat . . . what am I
gonna’... oh, phooey.

The Depth! Relevance! Soci-
ety couldn’t think of anything to
write this week so the Board of

Directors asked me to wing it. I

mean, I had a few ideas, but good-
ness! they were petty. Embarrass-
ing. I wouldn’t even tell my best
friend about these conceptual . . .

But, maybe, OK. Just to give
you an idea, I was thinking about
starting off this weekly lunge for
infinitesimal straws with the fol-
lowing sentence: ‘The only thing

funner than shaking a bee up in a

jar, dumping him out, pulling off
his wingsand watching him wobble
around is hunting lightning-bugs
with a whiffle bat.’

Can you believe that? Talk
about hurtin’, Then I was maybe
gonna’ describe the crisp ‘plink’
sound that sort of shimmies up
your arm when the fat part of the
bat gets one right on the translu-
cent butt, and then...

But you get the picture. Who
wants to listen to me wallow in
such moral, verbal, and insectual
mud?

Itgotreally bad. even thought
about... well... You remember
those great big red plastic Fat Albert
whiffle bats? The ones approxi-
mately one kilometer in diameter
with which a four year could not
possibly miss a small perforated
ball much less a younger sibling’s
head (Kenner absolutely guaran-
tees an undamaged fontanel no
matter what happens with these
bats).

Well, I wanted (yes, the thought
brought me pleasure) to describe
how us boyz in the hood used to
round up a whole Jif jar of fire-
flies, sneak off to the darkest cor-

ner of the yard, release the prison-
ers and swing away. Golden pa-
rabolas swivelled off into the night,
dozens per swing, and hardly any
stuck to the bouncy-slick surface
of my battle bat:

Ug! Yucky! I apologize. But

just to complete the thought, I
planned to relate the preceding list
of activities, with choice additions,
to the pertinent theme: ‘Homecom-

nipped.

Then I thought, “Criminy! I’ve
gotto writeabout something.” Then
I remembered thiaf'Tast week, for
the first time, someone responded
to the Society’s publication and
proposed a series of questions.
Maybe I’d answer some.

Like #1 concerning the forma-
tion of a box: Is it not true, since
there is absolutely nothing inside
that box, that the universe expands
exactly one cubic foot? -- No.

Or #5: If you dug a hole and

working components of that ma-
chine?

J: Yup. I see a lot of people,

ay Ferguson &
Anthony Foxx

particularly in the academic world,
who cling to-traditiénal western
culture as if everything else were
sinking sand. I’d say this is espe-

Week

foundanewcolor,whatwould you
call it? -- Rude.

Or #8: What exactly is a track
team supposed to do withonly three
lanes? -- Run, presumably. And,

for that matter, shouldn’ t a soccer
team play on a soccer field? --
Why yes!

Or #9: Does the Davidsonian
getread anywhere else besides the
bathroom? -- No (It might help if
they’d stock those things more
regularly, don’t you think?). ©

Or, most importantly, #3: If
there is a dead man hanging froma
rope attached to a hook at the top
and wrapped around his neck atthe
bottom and underneath him is a
puddle of water, and there is abso-
lutely. nothing else in the room,
how did the man die? -- Well,
obviously, urinating (many thanks
to RML).

But that wouldn’t do either.
Too technical. You must sense my
frustration.

Then, as the clock struck mid-

night and all seemed, if not lost, at
least decidedly misplaced, a tremor
jostled the heavens (so they tell
me). Translucent base paths criss-
crossed somewhere out there --
way, way out there -- and tangled
across the distant boundry of spiri-
tual things. And outof the celestial
quagmire something whole burped
forth (Milton, eat my shorts).
Brightness it was -- sort of -- defi-
nately tinted and itlurched through
space and time (a curved trajec-
tory, of course) and plummeted
earthward like a wicked slider. In
cathode tubes across the nations it
amalgamated and conformed, ar-
rogating the cumulative strange-

ness of 666 episodes of In Search~ |

cially true at Davidson. I honestly
think that what we need here is a
huge influx of alternative perspec-
tives into the curriculum.

I mean, if we can have an en-
tire Humanities department de-
voted to the study of western cul-
ture, how about just a few courses
dealing with other cultures and
worldviews in a comprehensive
manner?

A: That would be good, but there
are going to be those who say that
western culture and values are the
only tools we need to be success-
ful. But what does “successful”
mean? Does it mean driving a
BMW and using a cellular phone,
or does it mean walking barefoot

and deodorantless on the steps of
the Capitol? It is clear to me that
we have inherited the definition of
success, and it seems centered
around preservation of self.

J: Exactly. That’sall we’ re taught,
so that’s all we know. As far as
Davidson is concerned, I feel that
to broaden the curriculum is to
broaden our minds.

Sometimes I almost think that
people around here are afraid to
open their eyes and find out thatall
they know is not necessarily all
there is.

A: There ismore, and itis not so far
