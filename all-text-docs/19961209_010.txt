Chanukah

Chanukah celebrates the
covenant between man and God

By CINTRA POLLACK

Chanukah is the Jewish cel-
ebration of lights. Although many
would equate its importance to the
Jewish people as equal to Christ-
mas for Christians, it is a relatively
minor holiday. It falls so close to,
and sometimes coincides with
Christmas depending on the lunar
calendar, so it, too, has become a
time of gift-giving. Originally,
though, Chanukah did not have
such a commercial character. It is
a holiday about celebrating the
enduring covenant between man
and God.

Thousands of years ago, in
Judea, a tyrannical Greek king,
Antiochus, decided that the Jews
should not be worshipping their
God and should instead worship
the pantheon of Greek gods.
Antiochus sent soldiers into Jerusa-
lem where they destroyed the sa-
cred temple and forced the Jews to
stOp practicing Judaism. Pagan
statues were erected in the des-
ecrated temple.

The Jewish people had trouble
fighting against the Greek soldiers;

they were a largely agrarian soci- .

ety with little military strength. A

group of people led by Judah
Maccabee disappeared into the
mountains to prepare for a revolt.
After some time and a lot of care-
ful strategizing, the Maccabees,
as they came to be
called, emerged to
fight the Greeks and
amazingly were vic-
torious. When they

as well.

They searched the rubble of
the temple only to find a small
bottle of oil lurking in a corner, but
even this small supply was not

enough oil to keep the light burn-
ing until they could get a new sup-
ply.

Miraculously, the oil kept the
eternal light lit for eight days, and
thus Jews celebrate Chanukah to
not only commemorate the victory
of the Maccabees over the Greeks,
but the miracle of the oil. These
events proved to the Jews the pres-
ence and reliabil-
ity of God.

The eight days the
oil burned is re-
membered by
contemporary
Jews with the
eight lights on the
Chanukah
Menorah, with a
ninth candle to
light the others.
We also eat food
like “latkes,” or
potato pancakes
because they are
cooked in oil, as
wellas other fried
foods. Itis atime
for family to be
together, a time for sharing joy and
peace, gifts and embraces.

Chanukah is the Jewish re-
membrance of the power of
miracles.

Romeo and Juliet, The English Patient, and 101 Dalmatians

Romeo and Juliet: Shakespeare
meets Robocop

Why bring Romeo and Juliet
to the screen and then twist it,
mutilate it, into a pseudo-arthouse
film which, in the end, seems more
like Robocop than Shakespeare?
The answer is, simply, the film
was attempting to fuse to medi-
ums, Shakespearean melodramatic
acting with rock-video directing.
Choppy, sped up editing, during
certain scenes, was enough to give
a viewer a migraine. A lot of
Shakespeare’ s lines—the ones that
were not cut—were obscured and
lost do to the fast, jerky editing,
and the manner in which they were
delivered; screaming lines over
gunshots, scteeching tires, andloud
soundtrack music generally makes
them hard to hear and, especially
in Shakespeare’s case, to fully di-
gest. The best moments in the
movie were the quiet ones between
Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and
Juliet (Claire Danes). These two

Exams loom in the not-far-
enough future, deadlines for pa-
pers plague the minds of diligent
students, and Davidson’s usual
friendly atmosphere has taken on
a darker tone, shadowed by the
stress of our over-achieving
minds. However, on Tuesday
night, the entire campus bright-
ened up—literally. There was a
phenomenal turnout at the tradi-
tional campus wide Christmas
party and tree lighting, sponsored
by the Union. Students bearing
backpacks tooka short study break
to celebrate the joy of the Christ-
mas season.

However, everyone was dis-
appointed that Santa and Mrs.
Claus didn’t repel down Cham-
bers. It just wasn’t the same with-
out that magical moment of

freshmen felt disillusioned. Iheard
one question the authenticity of
the event, wondering if she had
just been naive enough to believe
that Davidson legend. “I thought
Santa was supposed to repel down
Chambers or something,” she said,
sounding a little betrayed. “Did I
miss it?” Nope, kids, you didn’t
miss anything, it just didn’t hap-
pen. Rumor has it that Santa the
repeller was feeling a' under the

Christmas is here.

‘from his bag as he drove reck-

Santa’s suspension in air. The ;

weather and not up to his agile
self.

Some were also a little over-
come by the treats Santa threw

lessly through the crowd. Evi-
dently, good old St. Nick does
watch us when we’re sleeping,
knows when we’re awake, knows
if we’ ve been bad or good and is
quite knowledgeable of the
Union’s relentless campaign for
AIDS awareness, as from his bag
of goodies he produced condoms,
which he threw into the crowd.
Nevertheless, the campus-
wide Christmas was a huge suc-
cess, offering socialization and
study reprieve for worn-out, mid-
night oil burning scholars. Cook-
ies, apple cider and hot chocolate
were offered by the Union, ap-
peasing stress-induced appetites.
As the bells from DCPC rang in
the Christmas season and volun-
teers from the concert choir led
the attenders in carols, the lights
luminated the lawn just before
everyone’s candles melted away.
The spirit of Christmas sud-
denly appeared all over campus.
Santa hats and elves outfits could
be seen at every turn smiling,
festive friends gathered for pic-
tures, and for a while everyone
seemed to forget about all the
responsibilities that this time of
year brings and enjoy the season.
