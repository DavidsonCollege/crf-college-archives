408 give blood for Project Life Bone Marrow Drive

By Liz NEIHEISEL
Staff Writer

The Project Life: Bone Marrow
Drive for the 1997-98 school year con-
cluded Wednesday with a final tally of
408 people typed. The drive took place
in the Morrison Room of the Union on
Nov. 19 and 20 from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00
p.m. each day, allowing staff, students,
and community members to partici-
pate.

This year’s drive was’ the most
successful since the initial bone mar-
row drive nearly eight years ago, which
typed 473 people. It was the first drive
in many years to exceeded 400 partici-

pants. While this year’s success was
undoubtedly a result of the sizable fresh-
men class, an impressive number of
upperclassmen who had never been
typed also became involved.

Senior Ryan Gist felt the impetus
to be typed after the father of a close
friend.was diagnosed with leukemia.
“T never really thought about it in years
past,” Gist said. “(This situation) defi-
nitely made it a more serious issue.”

Classics Professor Peter Krentz,
who has taught at Davidson for 18 years,
came out to be typed after hearing fel-
low professor Susan Roberts speak
about her own son’s illness, and the
need for constant growth within the

bone marrow registry.

While many students came out to
support loved ones and friends plagued
by the ill-fated disease, the majority
came out of'a simple desire to help those
in need. “It’s a good thing to do and it’s
easy,” freshman Sarah Brautigen said.
“It could be anybody you know that
needs bone marrow,” classmate Monica
Martinez added.

All those typed were eager to.en-
courage others to become involved.
“Why not?” asked freshman Justin
Boner. “It takes five minutes to poten-
tially save a life.”

The success of the drive was due,
in no small part, to the extensive efforts

of this year’s Project Life Committee,
headed by general chairperson Kate
Stevens. “Ireally want tocommend the
efforts of this year’s committee,” she
said. “It wasn’t the work of four or five
people, but all 25 working in equal
amounts to educate and publicize on
campus and to raise money for the
drive.“

“Tt was really exciting forthe Com-
mittee to see Such a great turnout,” said
Meredith Benke, education chair for
Project Life. “The days of the drive are
really an experience after working so
hard. It’s great to see how much has
come together.”

Fellow committee heads included

publicity chair Ginger Bond and
fundraising chair Charles LeGrand.
Bond, a junior who has been involved
with Project Life since her freshman
year, felt gratified by the results of the
drive. As publicity chair, Bond played
a leading role in advertising the drive
around campus, with a focus on the,
freshman halls.

LeGrand, also a senior, worked
with T-shirt sales, letter-writing cam-
paigns, and various other programs to
pool funds for this year’s drive, sur-
passing the nearly $15,000 required for
the drive by over $1,000.

Student, prospective treated for ‘excessive consumption’ of alcohol

By SARAH OGDEN
News Editor

Two incidents of dangerous alco-
hol ingestion were reported two Satur-
days ago.

One Davidson College student was
found “intoxicated and unconscious” in
Richardson dorm at 12:39 a.m. after
consuming alcohol at an unknown lo-
cation, according to a Nov. 16 police
report by Campus Police Sergeant Dave
Harding.

The student was transported by
ambulance to Charlotte’s University
Hospital, with the student’s Hall Coun-
selors following medics. Associate

Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano was
notified, the police report said.

The other episode of dangerous
consumption involved a 17-year-old
baseball recruit who was visiting the
College: The prospective was found:
“really intoxicated” in Irwin’ dorm at
1:48 a.m. the same night; said Campus
Police Lieutenant David E. McLaurin.

The recruit, said McLaurin, had
been drinking both liquor and beer.

According to McLaurin’s report,
the prospective consumed <alcohol at
the Air Band party at Phi Delta Theta
(better known as Phi Delt), leading to
the state of intoxication. The recruit
then returned to Irwin and fell uncon-

scious.

The prospective was taken to Uni-
versity Hospital as well, and baseball
coaches Dick Cooke and Brett Boretti
were called. Boretti went to the hospi-
tal, while Cooke contacted the recruit’ s
father.

“The Phi Delt party was shut down
an hour early because of this incident,”
the police report said.

_ McLaurin asked that names and
identifying characteristics of those in-
volved in the incidents not be released.

Phi Delt President Ellis Boyle said
that he has asked other Phi Delt mem-
bers about the baseball recruit and has
found that the fraternity house bears no

direct responsibility for the episode.
“Ithinkit’s aproblem,” said Boyle,

“but it’s more of a problem with the kid

and his host,” not the house, although

. “there is some regret” by Phi Delt.

“We were relieved to find he was
okay,” Boyle continued.

“I think we were on top of it,”
Boyle said, pointing out that members
of the house helped take care of the
recruit. “We (at Phi Delt) have been
very Vigilant” observing alcohol regu-
lations, especially because of the recent
cases of alcohol poisoning at other na-
tional fraternities, he continued. “That's
not what we’re about.”

“We think Air Band was a suc-

**1t’s not Court-related. I think the Court gets a bad rap.”

Risk Managing very well.”
