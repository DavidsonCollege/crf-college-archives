Judy Gorman:

Music from the core of the earth

By GEorDIE SCHIMMEL
Sraff writer

Her plane from New York was
two hours late. The traffic on I-77
was thick, almost impenetrable.
Nonetheless, she arrived in perfect
spirits, smiling, her guitar strapped
to her back.

Asacomplementto Women’s
Month, the College Union’s
Women’s Issues Committee hosted
singerand songwriter Judy Gorman
to speak and sing in the 900 Room
last Friday. At four, she spoke
about women in the history of
music. Later, in her concert at
seven, she performed her original
work and songs by other artists.
Sophomore Sara Smith described
the concert as “thought-provok-
ing,” andshe said that “youcouldn’t
help feeling that something larger
than words was being exchanged.”

Indeed something was ex-
changed. How it was, however, is
partly what makes Gorman so ef-
fective. She considers herself fore-
most a musician but not necessar-
ily a female musician, and so she

speaks from the broader human
experience. By this, she pierces
directly to the human condition,
addressing men and women on
equal terms.

Another aspect of her tech-
nique is audience participation. In
herdiscussion she directly involved
the students, asking relevant and

. intelligent questions ranging from

the J. Giles Band’s “Centerfold” to
Madonna’s explicit sexuality and

_ the questions it raised. And at her

concert she had the audience clap-
ping and singing along in a sort of
call and response. Very effective
indeed.

Gorman became interested in
women’s music history quite by
chance, she says. She was reading
essays from a feminist journal ona

-plane in Europe. One dealt with

women’s relationship to singing
and song writing. That women
would have a history in music fas-
cinated her — in college she re-
members professors reminding her
that there were, after all, no women
Bachs and no women
Shakespeares.

So began the search. Gorman
wanted to know why she didn’t
know anything about this subject.
In a mingling of her thirst for an-
swers and her natural gift of song,
Judy Gorman not only began to
speak about this hidden aspect of
women’s heritage, but also to sing
about it.

She may have discovered her
perfectmedium. Her voiceis clear,
deep, and powerful. Complement-
ing one of her favorite musicians,
Gorman said that Aretha Franklin’ s
voice sounded as if it came from
the center of the earth, up through
her feet and out of her mouth. Judy
Gorman could have just as accu-
rately described herself.

Like any artist, Gorman has of
course struggled. She was almost
as afraid of success as of failure.
Women, she recalled from some
distant, censorious voice, were not ©
supposed to succeed. On March
17, Judy Gorman mocked all the
censors and sang from the core ot
the earth.

Both Wyrick and Love intend
to further hone their skills with
graduate study at some point, but
after graduation from Davidson
they will both probably take some
time off before reentering the class-
room.

Although it surfaces differ-

ently in the two shows, each artist
would agree that part of the moti-
vation behind their exhibitions is
to portray, as honestly as possible,
themselves in their art. For Wyrick,
self portraiture is a “confessional”
process. Love's work is a matter of
“letting things come to you in dif-
ferent ways,” ranging from study-
ing art history to roaming thrift
stores for inspiration.

If you missed these first two
exhibitions, stroll by the Smith
Gallery to see the next four senior
art shows, which will alternate
every two weeks.

drum, popped and slid along the —*

bottom end. I’d never seen a
washboard player before but,

alas, they do exist, and this one
didn’t look nearly as bored as I’d
imagined a washboard player
would look. (I mean, really, how
interesting can sliding a spoon
across a rippled piece of metal
be?) The keyboardist, a dwarf,
constantly switched between two
keyboards in what I guessed to
be a Caribbean rhythm. Okay,
the guitarist didn’t move that
much, but when he hit his solos,
he couldn’t afford a lot of |
distraction. This was zydeco.
The music was based on
rhythm, so I'll talk about
drums. This was the first
time I’d heard drums
played as an instrument in
the truest sense. Not only
did the drummer play a
crisp beat to keep everyone
in time, launch into perfect
solos, and keep things
interesting with fills
galore, but he also played
with pitch. Holding one
drumstick against one of
the toms, he moved it back
and forth along the drum
head while hitting the
drum with his other stick,
creating all kinds of
different sounds in
between those dictated by
the size of the drums. It
was incredible.
Complementing the
drums was the washboard
which appeared in about
half the songs. To my
untrained ear, there were
only a few stock rhythms
to play with, although they
were played flawlessly. At
times, songs would break

in the middle with only the
drums and bass playing. During

‘one of these interludes everyone

else picked up some form of cow
bell and added to the already
complex beat. Maybe that was
Caribbean rhythm.

The bass borrowed from
reggae and funk but added
impressive flourishes like
harmonics and two-hand tapping.
The bassist’s hands ran all over
the fretboard. On top of the bass,
the keyboards were sprinkled
gently into the mix with sounds
ranging from funked-out
synthesizers to a deep organ or
clavier. The accordion never
took the spotlight either and
served the music well by
bridging verses.

The guitar came to the
forefront only during a couple
solos, when it switched from a
clean, off-beat rhythm to a soft
distortion that cut through the
rest of the music enough to
simply be heard. At one point,
the guitarist dropped out of his
wah phase and switched into
Hendrix’s “Voodoo Chile,”

which brought some applause.

Although it may seem that
something might have to take the
lead and the vocals are the only
thing I haven’t talked about, the
music definitely did not depend
on words or melody, which were
kept at discrete levels at all
times. Usually it was from
Terrance’s mouth that the words
danced, but on occasion the
keyboardist, bassist, and drum-
mer all added harmonies to
augment the sound. The device
was effective, and éach of their
voices held its own.

The musicianship of the
southwestern Louisiana band
was unarguable, and no one
player cared to overshadow the
rest. Rarely has so much pure
excitement taken the stage. I
think the band was a bit disap-
pointed that so few members of
the audience were interested in
dancing, or moving at all for that
matter.

I left the show with one
question that only a person from
the West would have. Just who
was the old King of the Bayou?
