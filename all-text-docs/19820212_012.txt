Sister Introducing Brother to
Big Church on Christmas Eve

This is Big Church
where Grow-Nups come on Sunday

so there are no toys.
God lives here.

Daddy plays the organ.
Mommy sings in the choir.

Sometimes you can hear:the rest of the choir
sing with Mommy.

Sometimes the people sing.
Then we stand up.

and open this book and sing.
The program says know 152.
That means learn the One:

Mommy says we can’t chew gum

about-God and Jesus and reckeet-silly-ashun

when there’s nothing good on T.V.

There’s lots of stuff todo
while the pasture talks.

Or look at the stained glass windows
and copy the pictures of God.

At the end

_ ‘Some men pass around big plates.

‘We put money in them |

and if you're poor you can take some out
and-God gets the rest

and I think he gives it to Santa Claus _
so he can make more toys.

‘Mommy says Santa will come after midnight
if we're good and p’lite

and act right

in Big Church tonight.
