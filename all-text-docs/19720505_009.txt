Asst. Sports Editors

Writing on THE DAVIDSONIAN sports staff for
past four years has been a fun-filled, hectic, exciting, fru
trating, creative and humorous experience.

The satisfactions and disappointments have been many,
but here are the ones we remember most vividly: .

Enjoying Rocky Crosswhite’s weekly “On The Bench”
column...

Homecoming 1968 - wearing freshman beanies and
forming a “human tunnel” for the team. . .

Going to Charlottesville for the 41-14 disaster against
UVA, as the Cavaliers rolled up an ACC record of 692
yards total offense. . .

Having a Phi Beta Kappa, Homer Smith, as football
coach...

1969 - the Year of the Cat in basketball - going 27-3,
being ranked as high as second nationally; those were the
days. ..

y Working on the paper until 2 a.m. almost every Thurs-
day morning; writing stories that were never printed, or
were often cut in half...

Interviewing Coach Stevens - the Bomber was always
good for such perceptive insights as: “I’ve come to the con-
clusion that the only difference between the so-called ma-
jor and minor sports is who gets the money for scholar-
ships”...

P'peating Furman 77-14, Richmond 37-7 and East Caro-
lina 42-27 on the way to the Tangerine Bowl, and the Slade-
to-Kelly-or-Hannen passing combination. . .

Watching the Tangerine Bowl on TV, except for the
third quarter. Network difficulties. . .

Lefty taking his T-Bird to Maryland and leaving the
basketball program to Larry Brown.. .

Larry Brown leaving the confusion of the basketball
program to Terry Holland. . .

Terry Holland not leaving for Wake Forest, fortunate-
ly...
Hearing the DC Pep Band render “Windy” and “25 or
6 to 4” at least 85 times during basketball season. . .

Trying to decipher the many moods of Coach Harry
Fogleman in covering the tennis and soccer teams. . .

The agony of watching Maloy, Cook and Kroll fritter
away their senior year and miss a shot at the NCAA title. . .

Coach Heath Whittle’s mysterious analysis of an in-
door track meet: ‘We just wasn’t ready for that stiff of
competition”. . .

Seeing a 59-game home basketball winning streak
shattered by an upstart Furman team and Country Joe
Williams. . .

Writing lampoon stories about Bryan Adrian and other
things, and seeing them almost come true...

Running in the Freshman Cake Race and finishing se-
venty-third, luckily getting the next-to-last cake. . .

The Varsity-Alumni football game, where there are
as many drop-out football players on the old-timers as
there are alumni. . . ; ;

Doing voluminous research in trying to write the
Whittle retirement story a year early. . . ;

The yearly football press releases announcing the do-
zens of blue-chippers who will play WILDCAT FOOTBALL...

For example: “Dexter Dudley, a 5-11, 165-Ilb tackle
who earned nine letters in eight sports at Central North-
cast Upstate Valley Poly High School, and made third team
all-Upper South Midlands Tri-County Conference”. . .

All the fourth quarter losses in football the past two
years. . .

Trying to write an IMAC basketball report...

The sad story of Bryan Adrian, and the promising ca-
reer that never was. . . ; ay

Listening to the rapid gibberish of “Weird” Harold
Wilkerson behind the plate: “Huh-na-huh-na, cum-schenck,
cum-schenck” or something like that. . .

Dave Fagg’s two degrees of winning: on the field and
off the field. . . ;

Listening to Ray Cook of WRKB, the only announcer in
captivity who would criticize Madison Square Garden. . .

“<a new basketball coach, Jim Lasagna (or Larry
who?). . .

Trying to run on, and write about, the track team at
the same time. . .

Tennis stars Koury, Dumansky and Lankenau - where
are they when we need them?...

Two conference championships in soccer - another
dynasty? ... .

The ubiquitous, inexhaustible Sterling Martin, and
his many, many, many, many jobs; the only coach who
can still outrun the team. . . ;

_ Watching Ray Swetenburg almost outscore Guilford
in a track meet. . . -

it is hard to capture the intangibles of four years of
ao Davidson sports scene. _

All those people and events have given us a most re-
warding four years, and to them go our thanks. ;

The good has always outweighed the bad. . .we hope it
will stay that way for Davidson sports.

‘Fagg Praises Varsity Gridders
After Alumni Game Victory

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

After more than three weeks
of practice this spring, Grid
Coach Dave Fagg finally got to
see his team im action last Sat-
urday in the alumni-varsity
game.

Fagg was pleased with what
he saw in the varsity’s 34-20 de-
feat of the old-timers.

“The team is more aggres-

sive and quicker than last. year’s
team,” Fagg said, ‘‘and they
have the best spirit of any team
I’ve seen.”

Sandy Carnegie, coach for
the alumni team, also compli-
mented the team’s speed and
overall performaince.

Carnegie said that team was
much harder to work against
in the line because of their
speed and agility.

Putting Errors Drop Boyd
To Second In Golf Tourney,

By BRUCE BECKER
Staff Writer

Rusty Boyd’s 36-hole score of
153 led the Davidson linksters
to a fifth place finish in the
Southern Conference golf tourn-
ament.

Boyd tied for second with a
freshman from Richmond. The

winner was Pennik from ECU ©

with a score of 149.

The tournament was held on
Tuesday and Thursday of this
week at the par-72 Quail Rid-
ge Country Club in Sanford.

The tournament used medalist
play with each team represent-
ed by six or seven players.

The team scores were deter-
mined by the five best 36-hole
scores from each squad. East
Carolina won the team com-
petition with a compiled score
of 783.

After Tuesday’s play the Wild-
cat linksters held second place
and Boyd was among the lead-
ers with a two over par score
of 74.

Boyd was leading the field
after 27 holes. He was one
stroke ahead of Pennik when
he ran into trouble on the 28th

hole.

“I was leading the field by
one,” said Boyd, ‘‘when I ran
into trouble on the back nine.
I three-putted four times.”

On the first hole of the back
nine Boyd holed in three from
100 feet.

Later on a par five, Boyd
reached the green in two. From
15 feet he tried to can the putt
but rammed it over the cup
and three feet past. He missed
the shot coming back and par-
red his chance for an eagle.

Shaken by his failing putter,
Boyd also three-putted from 10
and 25 feet.

For the rest of the Davidson
squad Bob Reni, a freshman,

The alumni had several prob-
lems preparing for the game,
and were especially hurt in
their small amount of practice
time.

‘We only practiced for an
hour prior to the game,” Car-
negie said, ‘‘and that was to
get plays worked out.”

The confusion over what plays
to run was intensified when the
varsity decided to switch-de-
fenses Saturday. morning -be-
cause of scouts from Wake For-
est, ECU and several other
schools.

Fagg said that he feels that
the varsity continue to work
for a balanced running and
passing attack.

Despite the relatively small
size of the Davidson line, he
feels that the backfield will be
able to work well against their
opponents in the fall.

“Scotty Shipp has really de-
veloped well this spring, show-
ing both passing ability and
leadership,” Fagg said. ‘‘He’s
going to be a real fine quarter-
back.”

Shipp completed 10 of 22
passes in last Saturday’s game,
with two interceptions.

Fagg also complimented the
running backs, saying he would
match Dave Ingold, Al McCal-
lum and John Webel against
any backs he has coached.

In preparation for the regular
season, a system to incorporate
freshman players into the team
is being worked out.

Freshmen will be able to play
in varsity competition for the
first time next fall, and Fagg
said that arrangements were
being made to incorporate sev-
eral in the program, including
football camp and fall training.

more, had a 161. Both Sam
Mitchener, a junior, and David
Faison, a senior, shot 170’s for
the linksters.

The tournament was scheduled
to run Tuesday and Wednes-
day. However, in the second
round rain disrupted play. Of-
ficials of the tournament at-
tempted to play despite the dis-
mal weather but were forced
to postpone play until Thursday.

Dick Spinner, a sophomore, be-
came ill fiom golfing in the
rain and was forced to retum
to Davidson on Wednesday, giv-
ing the Wildcats only five play-
ers with which to finish the
tournament,
