CENTRIFUGAL THOUGHT,

lt is undoubtedly true that what a
man thinks most about is to him the
greatest thing in life. Ef a man puts
most of his thought upon his “tickets,”
books and book knowledge will seem to
him the biggest and best thing in life.
Should he spend most of his ime think-
ing about “the ladies,” they would to
him be the main part of existence. [fa
man thinks more about “skits” and the
dopes and yarns there, that will to him
be the main purpose of life. ‘Po soldiers
the war is almost the only ching in life,
because it is almost the only subject of
their thought.

‘Thought, contrary to most things na-,

ture has made, has centrifugal force. It
tends to concentrate upon the thinker
ands things” pertaining to him. | The
thinker's views thus tend to become nat-
row and his horizon small. Many men
yield to this force. “They think orily of
themselves, their — friendships, their
grudges, their studies, and foot ball, and
so their horizon of thought lies easily
within the limits of the “Hill” Others
overcome this force and their thoughts
attain a centrifugal force, leaving them-
selves and their surroundings to dwell
upon the great, high and noble things
that exist.

‘The present is the most remarkable
age the world has ever seen. More dif-
ficult problems are arising, and more
avenues of thought are opening — than
ever before. America, in many ways the
foremost nation of the world, is faced
with conditions and problems that tend
to mar her. “The negro question, the
mill question, the moral question, the
temperance question, unclean _ politics,
and many other problems, each require
much thought. Mexico in her turmoil.
poverty and wretchedness, should excite
thought. “The warring countries of Eu-
rope, their purposes, their feelings, their
suffering, and the results of the war, are
great subjects of thought. Japan is
faced with moral questions simply ap-
palling. India lies in as dense a dark-
ness of ignorance, poverty and degreda-
tion as Africa. China, changed in ten
years from a changeless empire to a re-
public full of thoughtful men and wo-
men, is faced with economic, social and
religious problems that awe the thought-
ful men by their magnitude.

. These last three nations contain over
half the population of the world. In the

and falling, cach American was created
to do his part toward its fulfillment. It
is not an age of individualism, or even of
nationalism, but of “worldism,” and of
worldwide thought. :

The great themes of God, man, man’s
duty to God, man’s duty to man, life,
death, eternity, faith, and service, which
have faced men from the beginning,
have yet to be thought through by cach
man.

A man whose thoughts leave himself
and the petty little things of life, and
dwell upon the big, true things of life,

DR. VINES ADDRESSES
Y.M.C. A. MEETING

‘The Y. M. C. A. service Jast “Thurs-
day evening was led by Wim. Hollister,
the president, W. G. Somerville, and
vice-president, J. G. Patton, being off
the “Hill” attending the Y. M. C. A
conference at Guilford College.

Dr. Vines, pastor of the First Baptist
church, of Charlotte, made a very force-
ful address. “The passage from which
his theme was developed was: “So fight
I, not as one that beateth the air.”

In speaking of life and its problems
he said: “he Christian life is a pur-
poceful life, and is only aggressive and
full af initiative when it is ino a war-
fare.” He then spoke of the campaign
which was soon to be held here, and his
words avere an inspiration .to his audi-
ence to work together in unison for the
greater success of the Chapman-Alex-
ander meeting. In speaking of the mean-
ing of a revival he showed that it had a
threefold purpose in that Christians are
quickened; backsliders are — reclaimed;
and sinners are saved. “The methods of
a revival which were given are: that it
he earnestly desired: that it be praved
for; and that it be discussed.
