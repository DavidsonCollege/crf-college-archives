Around the hom

-Charlotte’s dubious sports image

By HAP BRYANT

On Sunday, two critical sports
events took place, neither of
which concerned “scab” football.
The American and National
League Chamionship Series both
reached critical points — the
Twins, who have since won the
pennant, led the Tigers two games
to one; the Giants and Cardinals
were tied at’ two games each. I
turned on the television at ‘about
11:30 that night, expecting to see
a comprehensive wrap-up of the
two games. Instead, what do i get?
Two programs about the Oak-
wood Homes 500 Nascar race.

Granted, to some people in
this area, Nascar racing takes pre-
cedence. However, devoting one
hour of air time to highlights of
crashes is something I find a little
extreme. After all, who is awake
at that hour except the hard-core
baseball -fan, anxiously awaiting
the results of the penultimate
baseball series of the year? (You

casts in late May and early June.
However, in the midst'of the
drama of the playoffs, we see
Morgan Shephard and Brett
Bodine and Jeff Bodine crashing
as they enter turn 3 of the Char-
lotte motor speedway. We see
Dale Earnhart back his car up the
track, wheel it around like every
person must do on his/her driver's
test, and drive it into the pits. Has
anyone ever called Dale Earnhart
“Mr. October”? Give me a break.
Hopefully, when the NBA
comes to Charlotte, beginning
with an exhibition game this Fri-
day between the Hawks and the
Pacers, Charlotte’s current sports
image will change: Instead of hav-
ing shows about races, Charlotte
TV will have specials about the
true racehorses of the NBA, like
Dominique Wilkins and Michael
Jordan. Instead of having
Domino’s team tennis, Charlot-
teans will watch some matches of

basketball are cranking their sea-

will lose media coverage to the

the sports atmosphere which
Charlotte has projected nation-

Charlotte could not support an
ABA team or a world football
league franchise. Yet 80,000-ptus
people go to the world 600 at the
speedway. Thankfully, George
Shinn has saved the Charlotte O's
for the moment, but what kind of
support will they have in a city
where more people go to wrestling

Yes, Charlotte is a growing
city. But is it a major-league city?
That question remains to be an-
swered. In 1988, the Charlotte

first time. Their success, to a large
measure, depends upon fan sup-
port over the first five years.

for the team, as management at-

formulate a competitive squad.
But if the fans walk out, as Ob-
server columnist Ron Green wrote
last year, Charlotte will be os-
tracized by the big leagues for a
long time to come. The same
would hold true if Charlotteans
neglected their team for the sake
of Neil Bonnett and Ricky Rudd.

Wildcat football loses to
Wingate’s Bulldogs

By STEWART RAWSON and
MATT TERRELL

In what is beginning to be a
weekly occurrence, Davidson
took to the field against the NAIA
Divsion II Wingate Bulldogs and
came away losers for the 17th
straight time. The Bulldogs, in
their third year of scholarship
football, brought a 2-3 record to
Richardson field and marched
home with an even 3-3 mark.

Davidson jumped to a quick 3-
0 lead on a 43-yard field goal by
jacobs. But Wingate fought back
with two touchdowns, while fail-
ing to score on a conversion after
their second touchdown. Ths
homecoming crowd sensed immi-
nent defeat. Then, out of
nowhere, the Cats purred to life,
as Aaron Edwards returned Win-
gate’s kickoff deep into Bulldog

_ territory.

The crowd sprang to life and
rallied behind the Wildcats. mo-
ments later, Mike Scoczynski
handed the ball to Ian Filiss, who
scampered for a l-yard touchdown
run. .

came closest to breaking the tie
with only a minute left but this op-
portunity went inches wide right
and it anne at 1-1.

On Wednesday, the Cats were
hoping for the upset as 14th-
ranked N.C. State came calling.
The Pack was leery of this and
jumped on top in the first half. A

Kelly’s outstretched hands and
found an unmarked State player
who buried it in the net. The teams
played evenly the rest of the half
and left the field at 1-0 state. The
second half saw balanced play for
the first twenty minutes, as David-
son launched countless attacks
which the Pack repeatedly
stopped with fouls. State did not
try to hide its hacks, and was sub-
sequently assessed five yellow
cards. N.C. State did muster sev-

distance once more. The Wildcats
had to settle for a field goal; this
one a 32-yarder from Jacob, send-
ing the two teams to the locker
rooms with a 13-13 deadiock. The
fans remained in the stands for
once (due in part to the homecom-
ing festivities). Regardless of the
outcome, the Wildcats could be
proud of a fine first half showing.
With the tied, the Bulldogs
came out strong and jumped to a
quick 20-13 lead in a 83-yard pass
from Richard Jacobs, a converted
‘inebacker. Davidson answered
with a 25-yard bullet from Scoc-
zynski to Charlie Winborne with
Jacob providing the point after.
But with the score at 20-20 with
10 minutes and 2! seconds left in
the third quarter, the bubble burst
as Wingate scored 30 of the next
37 points in the game. A final
glance showed 50-27 on the
scoreboard as the cats fell to 0-6

liant display of skill. The goal was
scored on a scoop shot that froze:
Kelly in his tracks, as it appeared
certain to sail over the goal before
dipping under the bar for the
score. This tally broke the Cats’
spirit, as State managed to control

to the 3-0 win. With the loss,
Davidson fell to 6-4-3 heading
into Saturday’s home encounter
with Liberty.
