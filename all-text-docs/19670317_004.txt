Others, he said, think of the

to centralize all non academic
and nonathletic aspects of a

He should be able to maintain
a high degree of rapport with

heterogeneity of the student

tion a larger number of persons
of differing racial. geographic.

than those presently enrolled.

number of these persoris so that
they’ do not feel isolated in the

Office be increased so that one
staff member may be regularly
travelling on recruiting trips all
over the country, in much the
same way the Athletic Depart-
ment recruits.

ATHLETICS

In recent months Davidson's
Athletic Department has receiv-
ed a great deal of varied criti-
cism. We are here attempting
to consolidate this criticism so
that members of the administra-
tion, faculty, and Athletic De-
partment may know the causes

of student dissatisfaction and
the general form of the solutions
we desire.

1, The athletic program neith-
er answers nor seeks to answer
the needs of the student body as
a whole. Instead, the facilities,
financial resources, and coach-
ing staff are devoted to an en-
tirely too small minority of the
student body. Little or no in-
struction at all is offered in
non-varsity sports. Instruction
and facilities should be made
available on a regular basis in
a wide variety of athletic activi-
ties. especially in those sports
which may be participated in
after graduation. such as golf,
squash, tennis, and water sports.
The Athletic Department should
provide a physical education
program for all students. not an
athletic program geared primar-
ily to the needs of a few varsity
athletes. :

2. We are opposed to allowing
the Athletic Department the
prerogative of designating the
recipients of financial aid. All
forms of financial aid must be
awarded through the regular
scholarship program. Outstand
ing athletic abilitv should be re-
garded as an attribute which
better qualifies an individual for
acceptance into Davidson but not
as the sole iustification for fi-
nancial aid. The practice of a-
warding athletic scholarships,
without consideration of need.

ably train them. and stil! pro.

serves the needs of the entire
student body. The practice of
recruiting what are. in fact pro-
fessional athletic teams prevents
the Athletic Department from
serving the majority of the stu-
dent body and is not congruent
with the essential purpose of
Davidson College.

3. Although in the past athletic
publicity has enabled many peo-
ple to learn of the college and
its educational program, at pres-
ent the excessive publicity is
harmful because. it puts pres-
sure on the college to produce
better athletics rather than bet-
ter education.

4. The Athletic Department
must be considered as any other
academic department, including
being under the jurisdiction of
the faculty. It should become a
more integral part of the school
and have its major expenditures
reviewed by all concerned. The
faculty should be made aware of.
the activities and potentialities
of the Athletic Department.

STUDENT LIFE

The social situation of the Da
vidson student needs reform.
Our. immediate concern is in
four areas: dormitory life. a co-
ordinate college for wornien,
counseling and the College Un-
ion facilities.

1. The student attitude is af-
fected by living quarters. The

‘dorms, our homes for most of

four years, have inherent in
their design and fixtures no
other purpose than “the sforage
of students when not in use."
To make dormitory life more
tolerable we need:

a. New dorms to replace
Watts. Cannon, and East.

b. Interior alterations in the
remaining dorms to provide
suites, lounges and hall kitchens.

c. Room furnishings of some
style other than ‘‘late Salvation
Army."

The ‘chicken coop’ design is
not beneficial. and myriad other
schools have rejected it with
good results.

2. A coordinate college for wo-
men should be established at
Davidson. The presence of wo-
men would educate the David-
son man whose present treat-
ment of women is often im-
polite, though mannered, im-
personal, and. unfortunately.
sometimes cruel. Women should
be an integral part of life, not
an extracurriculum. Until this
college can be established reg-
ular visiting hours during which |
women would be allowed in the

College Ranks High
With Med Schools

Davidson College ranks No. 1
in the Southeast in percentage
of applicants accepted by the
nation’s medical schools, a re-
cent survey indicates.

According to information pub-
lished by the Association of
American Medical Colleges, 70.6
per cent of the Davidson stu-
dents and graduates’ who applied
to medical schools were accept-
ed.

This means Davidson ranks
No. 7 nationally. Rice Univer-
sity was highest with 85.1 per
cent. Duke University was
scored at 59.2 per cent, followed
by Emory University with 54.7.

.The survey was based on the

i|total number of applicants in

1964-65. The percentage of ac-
ceptance for present Davidson
seniors is higher than 70.6 per
cent, noted Dr. W. O. Puckett,

ment.

Poet Declines Offer

For Artist

Davidson's attempt to get an
artist in residence for next year
has failed.

Dean of Faculty Frontis John-
ston revealed that poet Donald
Davidson had been asked to
come to the Davidson campus
next year, but that he has de-
clined because of problems con-
cerning his health and schedule.

Davidson, professor emeritus
at Vanderbilt, was associated
with the Fugitive group of poets

ion with expanded facilities and
a more creative outlook. Specific
needs are:

a. Suitably furnished, semi-
private student lounges for en-
tertainment of women.

b. Separate reading rooms,
projection rooms, seminar
rooms, and lecture rooms.

during the 1920’s. This group of
Southern-oriented poets includ-
ed Davidson. Juhn Crowe Ran-
som, Allen Tate and Robert
Penn Warren, among others.
“This is not a new idea around
here,"’ said Johnston. “If funds
are available in the future we
would like very much to have
an artist in residence. We have
requested funds for this purpose
several times in the past, but
we have never been able to re-
ceive these contributions.”
