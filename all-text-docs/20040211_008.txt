Seniors excited about first marriage

MARTIN COURT—Newly-engaged se-
niors Trey Clark and Charlotte Lancaster
announced this weekend that they
“couldn’t be more excited” about their
first marriage. The young couple is look-
ing forward to experiencing what will no
doubt be a loving and enduring union—
until fundamentally different value sys-
tems and life goals will lead to their even-
tual divorce seven years from now.

“I’ve dreamed of this since I was a little
girl,” proclaimed Lancaster, showing off
the pear-cut diamond ring that Clark pur-
chased for $139 on E-bay. “I guess I just
never thought the day would come so
soon!”

The young pair announced the good
news of their engagement to friends and
family this Friday, following Clark’s pro-
posal to Lancaster at the Huntersville area
Carrabba’s. In a romantic twist, the pro-

“We both want a“

family, we both
hate pineapple
on our pizza.”

posal coincided with the couple’s five
month “anniversary,” which demarcates
nearly a half-year of their devoted and
caring relationship since meeting at the
Union foam party last fall.

“I’ve always known I would find my
wife at college, and I couldn’t hope for a
more beautiful, intelligent woman than
Charlotte,” Clark enthused. “I’m so glad I
got that job in Durham, so we can plan the
wedding while Charlotte’s in [Duke]
medical school.” The couple plans to
marry in December 2004, when they will
initiate a devoted and scared union that
will last a full 72 months before Lancaster
realizes Clark is sleeping with his secre-
tary. ~ ,
“Charlotte and I are perfect for each
other,” Clark reflected happily. “We both
want a family, and we both hate pineapple
on our pizza. After she finishes med
school, I can’t wait to move back home to
Wisconsin—we'll probably have two or
three kids by then. And that'll be great,
because then my can mom can stop casu-
ally mentioning to me that she wants
grandkids.”

Sources close to the young pair
couldn’t be more confidant about the
match. “See, Trey and Charlotte are a
good college couple—always working,
never spending much time together,
hooking up on the weekends,” said Clark’s
roommate Jason Davies ’04. “I just think

prospectives stu-

it’s great that they’re tying the knot so
they can finally sit down and get to know
each other.” Davies will in fact be there to
witness many key moments in the mar-
ried lives of his dear friends, from buying
their first car to having their first child to
almost killing each other in a fight involv-
ing hurled dinnerware when Clark
stumbles home drunk for the fifth time in
as many weeks.

So delighted were the couple’s friends
that they threw a celebratory “engage-
ment dinner” soon after the announce-
ment. Jeremy Weeks ’04, Clark’s fresh-
man roommate and planner of the event,

said he couldn’t be happier. “God, Trey is
such a lucky guy,” he enthused. “Not only
is Charlotte brilliant and gorgeous, but
she is utterly amazing in the sack. I mean,
so I’ve heard.”

Frances Price ’04, Charlotte’s closest
friend, echoed Weeks’ optimism. “Char-
lotte is really blessed to have found such
a caring and devoted guy to marry,” she
said. “You can just tell that he’s going to
be there for her—exactly the kind of guy
who can deal with the
stress-induced, massive
over-eating problem she’s
just barely been able to

hide from him all these months.”

Not wanting to waste any time,
Lancaster is currently considering several
options for wedding planners and has al-
ready rented out DCPC for the big day.
Touchingly, each step of the potentially
stressful planning process has only
worked to reassure her of her fiancé’s
compatibility.

“Trey is my soulmate,” she said, gazing
lustily at a photo of the couple from this
year’s Pigapalooza. “I
know he’s going to be sup-
portive of my choice to be-
come a cardiac surgeon,
even though it means we'll
have to put off having kids
until I finish my residency
and stuff.” Lancaster went
on to gush about the
“trendy apartment we'll
have, maybe in New York
or Chicago.” Little does she
realize now that her
dreams will come true—
and the couple will move
into an East Village loft
apartment in just five years time, the site
of innumerable screaming matches,
sleepless nights, and Lancaster’s sudden _
enraged attempt to stab Clark with a
grapefruit spoon.

For the groom’s part, the future
couldn’t be brighter. “Charlotte is beauti-
ful, and she is amazing,” said Clark, who
just tomorrow will begin compiling the se-
cret collection of shoe-fetish porn that will
eventually result in the couple’s enroll-
ment in fourteen weeks of dreadfully un-
successful marriage therapy. “She’s the -
best girl I could have ever settled for.”
