Rachel’s
fourmost
movie

favorites

By Rachel Newcomb

Since this is my lastcolumn as
Arts Editor, I'd like to indulge in
another article about my favorite
things. This time I want to talk
about movies. Not the kind of
movies which are enjoyable but
easily forgotten when you leave
the theater. Or the kind that take
you on an emotional roller coaster
ride full of cheap thrills, leaving
you drained of tears or aching with
laughter at the end. Those movies
are fine, of course, but they don’t
change your life. And that’s what
I want to talk about. The kind of
movies that make you shiver with
astonishment at how good they
are. Movies you could watch over
and over and each time notice
something new about them.

There are very few movies
like that, but | can name my favor-
ites.

4. Kiss of the Spider Woman.

Starring William Hurt and the late
Raul Julia, this movie is abouttwo

men Sharing a prison cell in Latin
America, one jailed for conspiring
against the government, the other
fora minor sex offense. Raul Julia,
a much underrated actor who died
last year, is brilliant as the intense
political prisoner. Hurt acts with
great sensitivity and depth when
his character falls in love with
Julia’s., It is an excellent portrayal
of relationships which form under
duress between people who other-
wise would never have met.

3. The Graduate. This movie
is hilarious. It is especially appro-

» priate forthose of us aboutto gradu- -

ate who are wondering where in

. the world we’ll be next year. In
one of his earlier roles, Dustin
Hoffman plays an aimless college
graduate who spends the summer
vegging out by the pool. He begins
an affair with a friend of the family
who is also the mother of a girl he
wants to date. The scrapes he gets
into are extremely funny, and al-
though this movie was made in the
1960s it truly stands the test of
time.

2. The Sheltering Sky. Italian
director Bernardo Bertolucci brings
the Paul Bowles novel of the same
title to life in this sprawling pro-
duction. Debra Winger and John
Malkovich star as a bored couple
seeking adventure and oblivion in
North Africa after World War II.
The landscape is spectacular and
the story is extremely moving.
Much of the story takes place in
Morocco, which is one reason why
I like it so much. But it’s still a
good film, albeit a bit hard to fol-
low at times.

1. Cinema Paradiso. This is
currently my all-time favorite

Globetrotters return home
to tell their tales

Students gain exposure to remote cultures

by Renu Bhatt

“It was the best thing I ever
could have done with my study
abroad experience,” says junior
anthropology major Karen Morris.
This isacommon sentiment among
many of the returning Davidson
students who spent last semester
abroad. Many of them share fond
memories and experiences to share
with the Davidson College com-
munity, yet each student has had a
unique experience.

Imagine Niger, where the vil-
lages have polygamous societies
and white people are scarcely seen.
Morris traveled to Niger, where
she studied traditional children’s
songs and two West African lan-
guages, Haufa and Djerma. AI-
though she has an elementary level

ability in these languages, Morris
was able to communicate with the
people she worked with. During a
visit to a Nigerian village, Morris
worked as a Peace Corps volun-
teer. She was only the fourth white
person the natives in the village
had ever seen. Because it is un-
heard of for a woman of Morris’
age not to have a husband, she was
forced to invent the existence of a
husband. Otherwise, she was given
five marriage offers while in the
village. She had the pleasure of
finding out that she is worth three
cows and twocamels! Morris says
that she definitely would like to go
back and travel throughout Africa.

Farther south on the African
continent, Julie Timmons, a biol-
ogy major, was studying in

Botswana. The focus of her trip
was ecology and conservation.
Timmons did an independent study
on termites, trying to discover the
optimal living conditions for them.
She learned that termites require
lots of moisture and low tempera-
tures. :

Timmons found the people
that she met in Botswana very
friendly. She lived with a family
and studied the language with them
for a few weeks. She also enjoyed
the slow-paced life that the people
of Botswana live. Like Morris,
Timmons spent a week living in a
native village. While there, she
had some entertaining experiences.
The children in the village, who
rarely saw white skin, would rush
out of their huts screaming,

“Makgoa! Makgoa!” “Makgoa”
means white person. A man in the
village gave Timmons a chicken
as.a gift, which she was expected
to pluck and cook, which she did.

One thing about Botswana that
concerns Timmonsjs the country's
overwhelming population of el-
ephants. The countryside is
swamped with elephants which de-
stroy gardens, homes, and forestry,
despite the fact that some are very
useful.
tional ban on ivory, the govern-
ment and people of Botswana can-
not do anything about the problem.
The elephants are endangered in
most parts of the world, but not in
Botswana, where they are a nui-

Christmas on the River Wild

While many of us spent the break letting Mom dote on us, some laughed in the face of death

Did you have any interesting
stories to tell about your Christ-
mas vacation? Talk to the
students who either canoed or
sailed with Davidson Outdoors.
Seven trip leaders accompanied
by Ed and Marlys Daugherty
(Davidson Outdoors directors)
ventured out to the Rio Grande.
They canoed about 18 miles a
day for a total of 85 miles down
the river.

In addition to learning more
about canoeing and running
rapids, the students hiked in
scenic areas, relaxed in Hot
Springs, and splashed around in
the natural pools of crystal-clear
rainwater.

Marc Le France commented
that the desert area was foreign
to him, and he loved seeing how
the water had shaped rocks and.
cliffs through the years.

The group only saw two
people during the entire 12 days
along the Rio Grande, Students
who speak Spanish tried to thank
the two Mexicans for the use of
their land. After the students
spent half an hour piecing words
together, the Mexicans shocked

the group by answering in nearly
perfect English!
Two new trip leaders,

_ freshmen Duncan McFarland and

Patricia Evans, had their first

experience in planning trips,
driving the vans, and making
decisions. Everyone got to know
each other well and developed
nicknames with funny stories

behind them.

After spending twelve days
out hiking and canoeing, the
group enjoyed showering, eating,
and relaxing in a hot tub at the
home of Stephen Eliot’s rela-
tives.

The sailing expedition, led
by Sumner Mitchell and Ann
Dupre Rogers, was a little
different from past years.

Instead of. spending the night
docked at the coast, the boats
were anchored together out in the
water.

Rogers said it made the

. experience more enjoyable

without the distractions of
crowds, other boats, restaurants,
and bars. An all-night sail,
sightings of dolphins, jellyfish,
and birds, and warm weather
made the trip exciting and
pleasant.

wonderful Davidson Outdoors
