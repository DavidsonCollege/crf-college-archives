Bakers give $2.5 million gift

Donation will help to fund new Baker — Watt life sciences complex

By BRAD GRIFFIN
Guest Writer

Drs. Frances and Lenox Baker,
Jr. of Norfolk, Virginia, have com-
mitted $2.5 million to the College
in support of the departments of
the life sciences.

The money will contribute
toward the construction of the
planned Watson Life Sciences

Building. In recognition of ‘their
gift, the college plans to name the
entire complex in memory of the
Bakers’ fathers, Dr. Lenox D.
Baker, Sr. and Dr. James Watt.
“When I was here, Dana wasa
wonderful building,” says Baker.
“We had great classrooms and lab
spaces, but we also had fewer stu-
dents using the building. When my
wife and I walked through there on

our last campus visit, I hardly rec-
ognized it. It’s crammed to the
gills.”

Baker, a member of
Davidson’s Class of 1963, cur-
rently serves as chief surgeon in
the division of cardiac and tho-
racic surgery for Sentara Hospitals
in Norfolk.

Frances Baker, like her
mother before her, is a pediatri-

cian.
The College hopes to com-

‘plete the building by the fall’ of

1998. Facilities for the life sci-
ences have not had a significant
upgrade since the biology depart-
ment occupied Dana Science
Building in the early 1960s. In-
creasing numbers of students ma-

joring in biology and psychology .

Presidential
candidates -
include non-
Presbyterians

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL
News Editor

Despite Davidson’s Board of
Trustees’ decision last February to
retain by-laws mandating that the
College President be “a loyal
church member, giving evidence
of strong Christian faith and com-
mitment through the affiliation with
the Presbyterian Church (USA),”
not all presidential candidates are
Presbyterians.

As seen earlier this month in
a Charlotte Observer article writ-
ten by Pam Kelley, Larry
Dagenhart, Trustee Secretary and
Chair of the Presidential Search
Committee, confirmed that not all
of the search committee’s candi-
dates are Presbyterian. .

However, Craig Wall, Jr.,
Chairman of the Board, told The
Davidsonian last semester that
“Davidson College is a church re-
lated institution, and [it is impor-
tant that] the chief officer be affili-
ated with the Presbyterian Church
in order to establish the foundation
and the core of the message we
wish to extend. The Board estab-
lishes policy and elects this chief
executive officer.”

Last February during the
Board of Trustees biannual meet-
ing at the College, trustees reaf-
firmed the strength of Davidson’s
religious ties. The Board voted to
accept, for the first time ever, non-
Christians as members of the reli-
gion department. In addition, trust-
ees upheld the school’s policy that
trustees must be Christians and
that the college president must be a
Christian, affiliated with the Pres-
byterian Church, USA.

community with a little flavor of the cultural world.

Not only did the eclectic representation of foreign
countries help to raise cultural awareness on a campus
that craves diversity, but it also helped to liven up an
otherwise ordinary Saturday afternoon.

Students wandered from stand to stand, tasting French
crepes, Mexican tamales, listening to a variety of musics.

Each country displayed scenic posters and wonder-
ful crafts that offered a visual perspective on their cul-
tural traditions and their own unique characteristics.

At around 1:00, the 900 room came to life with a

colorful parade of national flags.

Each country was introduced and two Brazilian
representatives, dressed in ethnic costumes, did the

In answer to their call for volunteers, two brave
women (and one very hesitant man) went up to the stage
and joined in. The “‘myringa” dance came next, followed
by Russian folk songs and dancing.

The audience participated enthusiastically; clap-
ping to the beat and humming along to the music.

So, for one afternoon, the Union was turned into a

Town council lifts ban on Main Street parking

By Ranpy HARTWELL

Less than two weeks into its
new Main Street parking policy
that prohibited students without
permits from leaving their cars
there, the Town of Davidson dis-
covered it had not yet found the
solution to Main Street merchants’

parking woes. Main Street em-
ployees outnumbered all-day park-
ing spaces, so to find more room,
“the most logical place seemed on
the north side of Main Street, away
from the stores,” says Town Ad-
ministrator Leamon Brice.

“We realize that displaced the
students,” he continues, “but we
didn’t have much of an alterna-

tive.” After a week and a half,
Brice says he and the rest of the
council “realized that not enough
people were taking advantage of
[the parking policy change] and
we needed to cut back on the num-
ber of permitted spaces and allo-
cate more two-hour places.”
Brice adds that “what we have
done is just that. We’ve made part

The new zoning of approxi-
