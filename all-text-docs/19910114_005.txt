Is An Offensive Attack On Iraq Jusitifiable Or Not?

From the Left: Sanctions should be
given more time to work

We find ourselves, both as
citizens of a free and democratic
nation and also of an interdepend-
ent world, not seeking new prin-
ciples for living together, but rather
new policies by which our security
and freedom shall be greater served.

and a strategic blunder of even
greater global consequences,
While the defensive actions
taken by the United States are jus-
tified, to begin a total military of-

Yet, we stand now poised on the
brink of war, as if unavoidable, ap-
parently forgetting, as has Saddam
Hussein, that our actions should be
guided by justice and reason.
Ironically, both antagonists,
Iraq and the allied coalition ar-
rayed against it, believe that their
penn a actions have been just
throughout th this, crisis. For its part,

Iraq justifies its 2 annexation of Ku-

wait upon the fact that Kuwait ne-
glected to abide by its agreed daily
production of oil quota, glutted the
oil market to keep prices low, and
thus threatened Iraq’s vital eco-

Iraqi aggression with firm resolve.
Numerous justifications exist. for
the American response, but two
arguments stand as the most popu-
lar: oil and opposition to naked
aggression. Of the two it is the
latter which is just since it is the
‘morally persuasive reason.

While Saddam Hussein’scon-
cerns were legitimate, his aggres-
sion was immoral and, on the prac-
tical level, a major strategic blun-
der. Hussein all too quickly walked

away from negotiations with

Kuwait and resorted to violent
confrontation. For him violence
was a reasonable option, not a last
resort.

finds itself in a similar position as

Other nations--Pakistan, South
Africa,tsrael (ifnot already)-- will
probably acquire nuclear weapons
in the nineties. Like Iraq some of
these countries have demonstrated

the willingness to use force against

neighbors, as well as inhabitants of
their own lands. Both Israel and
South Africa, for example, have
been condemned by the United
Nations for such acts. Should we
prep our calendars so that when
these nations approach nuclear
capability. we undertake military

_ action as the only “solution”?

Unquestionably, such a Pax Ameri-
cana would demand a larger sacri-
fice than Americans will be will-
ing to disproportionately endure.

Yielding to Iraqi
pressure on the first and second of
August in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,
the Kuwaitis agreed to reduce
production and’ help the Iraqis
rebuild their economy.

The Iraqis stormed out of the
discussions because they felt that
Kuwaiti was not offering enough.
That night Hussein sent his tanks,
planes and men over the Kuwaiti
border and into the capital crush-
ing the 20,000 man army. of Ku-

OPEC and ‘intimidating another,

this the heart of the international

It is nothing less than global
extortion. The Iraqis immediately
claimed that they were merely

Hussein then started anew with his
deception: the nation of Kuwait
was annexed as the 19th historical
province of Iraq. Sorry Saddam.
Persia won’t exist again for the
sake of your greed at the cost of
others’ blood.

Well, no longer do Saddam or
Aziz talk of the 19th Province. It’s
now the Palestinian issue and the
need for the resolution of a Pales-
tinian homeland. Saddam couldn’t
care less about either the Palestini-
ans or their homeland. He’s sim-
ply using the Arab world’s feel-
ings about Israel to drive the Arabs
out of the coalition. But the Arabs

Sanctions, a peaceful alterna-
tive to war, have been tested, and
found nominally effective. They
seem to hurt Iraq’s trading part-
ners more than Iraq itself. How

month, a year, two years? Will the

them indefinitly? Unlikely.

opinion and let us hear your view.
