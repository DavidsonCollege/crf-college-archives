Columbia Seminary
Entertains Locals

While in Atlanta competing in the
Tech Relays, the Davidson track men
were guests at the Columbia Theological
Seminary, where they were most pleas-
antly entertained. They were met at the
train and taken out to the Seminary in
cars, and were shown over the beauti-
ful new campus, after which they were
assigned rooms in one of the dormitor-
ies. Friday night the Wildcats were
guests at a reception given by the Jun-
iors. Every courtesy possible was shown

is so constructed that the harp.may

organ was chosen on the advice of

experts in this field, but only after
a very thorough investigation had been
made by the committee appointed to
select the organ for the auditorium.
The Skinner Organ Mfg. Co. is recog-
nized by all experts to be one of the
leading manufactures of pipe organs
in the United States.

Officials of the college consider the
school very fortunate in being able
to purchase an organ of this size and
cost. There are few colleges in the
South who have an instrument that
will compare with this one. It was
found necessary to procure an organ
which would equal the new auditorium
in magnificence and beauty therefore

one of the best organs obtainable was
bought.

and Banquet at Hotel Conclude
Semi-Annual Program

Thirteen students from the Senior and
Junior classes were “tapped” at chapel
exercises, Tuesday morning, by the
Delta Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa,
national honorary leadership frater-
nity. In one of the most impressive
ceremonies known to Davidson, and a
feature of the spring calendar, the men
who had been chosen for their qualities
of leadership were unknown until some
member of the fraternity chapter had

gone out in the student body and
“tapped” them.
M. M. King, president of the chap-

ter here, presided during the exercises.
After he had taken the chair, Dr. J. M.
MacConnell professor of History and
a member of Omicorn Delta Kappa,
briefly addressed the students, telling
of the purposes and object of the fra-
ternity, and paying a tribute to both

members and initiates.
Immediately following his talk, the
president wielded the gavel and an

older member of the Circle arose, went
into the student body and “tapped” his
man. The selected student arose and

ing church service here, while J. W.
Melton delivered a very interesting and
inspiring message. After the talk, Zeb
Long led in prayer. During the
vice, C. C. Orr rendered a violin
and George Pardington sung.

John Melton delivered a talk before
the Men's Bible Class of the Proxi-
mity Methodist Chureh; C. H. M¢ auzy

dist Bible Class; and J. R. Covington

The glee club singing a few of their |

number on the chorus prograin.

A saw novelty played by Jack Ram-

plause. He entertained with two dif- |
ferent well known melodies. His abil- |
ity to make music come from a well
rusted saw was marveled at by quite
a number of the townsfolk and stu-

dents.
The Sunnyland Serenaders playing
before the school audienee for the

first time since Junior Speaking, gave
the only life to the program that could]
be found. Without the orchestra and
a number of solos there would have
been little to entertain. The, jazz ren-
dered by the orchestra was fine, es-
pecially “Tiger Rag” and Sluefoot”.
