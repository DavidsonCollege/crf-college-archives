Duncan
requests
review

Davidsonian editor Philip
Duncan has filed a petition
requesting that the Review
Board consider certain aspects
of the disciplinary action taken
against him last week by the
Hearing Committee.

The petition, submitted to
Dean of Students Will Terry
Wednesday, requests that the
Board consider if the sanction of
probation imposed on Duncan is
“essentially appropriate in the
total context.”

Duncan’s defense advisor
Harry Greyard explained that
“the question is not one of guilt
or innocence; we entered a plea
of guilty. There are questions,
however, as to whether proba-
tion is an appropriate sanction.

Last week Duncan pleaded.
guilty to interfering with the
rights of Professor Alan Wolf
“to maintain private possession
over the contents of his faculty
mailbox’’—a violation of Sec-
tion IV of the College Code of
Responsibility. The Hearing
Committee sentenced Duncan-
to probation (exclusion from
extracurricular activities) for’
the remainder of the 1977-78
school year.

Terry will transfer copies of
Duncan’s petition to the Sec-
retaries of the Hearing Com-
mittee and the Review Board.
Under the code of Responsibili-
ty, the Board shall render a
decision on the case within 15
days after receiving the record
of the Hearing Committee's

proceedings.

to discrimination under any
program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance.

Plans are underway to make
all opportunities and programs
at Davidson accessible to the
handicapped.

In accordance with Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, the college is in a process
of self-evaluation. The Act
called for a Transitional Plan, to
be completed by December Sh
VOU

The plan, at a minimum, was
to identify physical obstruc-
tions, describe in detail the
methods to be used to make the
facilities accessible, and specify
the schedule for taking the
steps necessary to achieve full
program accessibility by June
3, 1980.

According to Director of the
Physical Plant Grover C.
Meetze, Davidson’s recently es-
tablished Department of Safety

(Gregg Strader)

has studied all areas of the
campus for accessibility to the
handicapped.

While Chambers has an ele-
vator, said Meetze, ‘‘We’re still
looking at the-best ways.to get
into the building.”

The solution will probably be
a mechanical lift or a ramp, he
indicated.

The problem with ramps,
Meetze remarked, is that they
can have no more than an 8.3
percent slope. High steps would
require a long ramp.

The eating houses, Dana
Science Building, Cunningham

Fine Arts Building, and the.

dorms will also be considered
for better entrances, said
Meetze.

“When Martin Science Buil-
ding is renovated,’’ said
Meetze, ‘‘considerations for the
handicapped will be worked into
construction.’’

$11,000 short of requests

ATC determines
budget allotments

By CHARLES ERWIN
Staff Writer
Forced to whittle more.than $11,000 off of the total amount of
money requested by campus organizations to operate with next
year, the Activities Tax Council (ATC) chose to ‘‘take a hard line”’
during their Monday and Tuesday meetings, according to

Chairman Marc Jackowitz.

They flatly refused to fund
the Davidson Christian Fellow-
ship.

They stripped all but $600,
out of the $2000 awarded last
year, away from the fledgling
Experimental Philosophy Jour-
nal,

They reduced the 1978-79
budget requests of over half of
those organizations traditional-
ly funded by the Council to
levels either equal to or less
than what is currently being re-
ceived.

They awarded a substantial
increase to only one organiza-
tion, The Davidsonian, even
though three-fourths of the
groups asked for more money
next year. Two other organiza-
tions were awarded small in-
creases.

At the same time, however,
the Council earmarked $1,100 to
be used in launching a new
campus literary magazine.

Jackowitz explained that the
record $58,500 available to the
Tax Council for distributions
was eaten up by the equally
record-breaking $69,952 reques-
ted by twelve student organiza-
tions.

The $11,452 gap between
these two figures created one
big headache for the Council.

In partial anticipation of the
problem, the activities tax was
raised by $5 earlier this year--
bringing to $45 the amount
levied upon every student. But
this just was not, enough and

there is already talk of raising
the tax again next year.

“It could be that there might
well be a recommendation next
year that the tax be increased. I
just don’t know whether it will
be successful or not,’’ said
College Business Manager and
Tax-Council member Robert
Currie.

There has been an “‘increas-
ing disparity each year,’’ ac-
cording .to Currie, between the
money students say they need
and the amount the Council has
to give.

For the last several years the
gap has hovered around $7000,
but this year it took a big jump-
-mostly due to a $6,610 rise in
the amount reguestéd by The
Davidsonian.

In addition organizations
which, according to Jackowitz,
only serve a part of the student
community were beginning to
come to the Council for help.

“We saw it happening this
year and we decided to take a
hard line in order to clarify what
organizations should be funded
and what organizations should
not be funded,” said Jackowitz.

“We have got to apply the
acid test of whether an organiz-
ation serves the entire commun-
ity,’’ Jackowitz charged the
committee on Tuesday after-
noon as they reviewed a request
for $325 from the Davidson
Christian Fellowship.

The Fellowship was seeking

Just what are our rights?

Features Editor
Dr. Carl Cohen brought controversy to Davidson on

An exposure to ideas

Is the press doing its job?

By CATHY ANSHELES ~
Staff Writer

Unlike national survey polls, Godfrey Budge” Sperling is

aN

Monday and Tuesday by revealing his views on what is
morally right and wrong in current events. His discussions
ranged from a defense of the National Socialist (Nazi) Party of
America to national racial and sexual discrimination.

Dr. Cohen’s visit was sponsored by the Z. Smith Reynolds
Foundation. He is Professor of Political Philosophy at the
University of Michigan.

In referring to the Nazi movement, Dr. Cohen discussed the
Nazi efforts to march in protest in Skokie, Illinois. Skokie is a
predominantly Jewish suburb of Chicago.

Cohen agreed that the Jewish community would suffer from
such a protest. However, he joined the American Civil
Liberties Union in supporting the planned march, which has
finally been approved in court.

He cited several philosophical and legal explanations for his
opinions.

Legally,-the ‘‘clear and present danger’’ doctrine of
constitutional law dows not apply. He refuted this argument

able to ‘‘warm up” the people he interviews, which makes him
feel ‘‘confident that my assesment of the public attitude is
pretty close to the mark.”’ One source for obtaining news for
his column in The Christian Science Monitor is Sperling’s
Breakfast Club. Started nearly 13 years age, the club’s first
guest was Charles Percy who was then running for Senator of
Illinois. .

Although the number of reporters present at the first

gathering was few, the event made quite a bit of news. The
frequency of the breakfasts increased after several years and
“Budge” says he now hosts these forums two or three times a
week.

Despite the fact that the format at the Sheraton Cariton
Hotel in Washington, D.C., is extremely informal, Sperling
emphasized that the reporters “don’t throw softballs.” The
contact with leading politicians that the breakfast club-

_ provides is considered by The Washington Post's Nicholas

Von Hoffman to be “invaluable to political writers.”
