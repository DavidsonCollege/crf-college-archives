which branch of the service he is
going to remain in to the end, ac-
cording to his assertion.

While at Davidson no one could
have worked more earnestly or with
more zeal for the best interests of
the R. O. T. C. and the college than
did the Colonel, and it was with gen-
vine regret that we learned of his
transfer last summer. He was into
everything at all times and the one
who could get ahead of him in any-
thing was doing good. Though by
no means easy, he was well liked by!
all on the campus and the best!
wishes of the student body as well
as the R.O. T.C. go with him to his
new position.

dent of Davidson College. on the!

connections of General Davidson

long and valued services of William
Lee Davidson, a son of General Da-
vidson, as a trustee of the college,
and who at his death left a large
sum of money to the college. The
exercises closed with a masterly
sketch of the life of General Da-

D.D., of Charlotte, N. C.. During
and after the exercises the Davidson
College Band gave many appropriate
selections.
