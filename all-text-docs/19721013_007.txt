Fallout Rations Are
Stored In Basement

“It's a million rounds of am-
munition. They'll use it to put
down a student rebellion,’ said
Sanford Steelman in regard to
the large supply of boxes
currently stored in the nor-
theast corner of the Belk Dor-
mitory basement.

A freshman stumbling down
the steps from the Davidson
College Student Store paused to
examine the cache. ‘‘Those are
all the books they don’t have in
the bookstore,’’ announced
John Steely.

Assistant to the President
Duff Bruce admitted when
asked what was in the box, “‘l
think it’s pretty obvious to
anybody. That's the uranium
for the reactor ."’

However, Custodian Sergeant
Penley, when asked about the
corrugated cardboard con-
tainers wedged between
bicycles and vending machines
swept aside these previous
speculations.

“Well, those boxes are the
emergency ration kits for this

defense.” Penley said. “If
there was some kind of
emergency, they'd come in
mighty handy.”

According to Sam_ D.
Maloney. chairman of the

Fallout’ Preparedness Com-
mittee at Davidson, these boxes
contain Civil Detense supplies.
mainly crackers and tood sup-
plements. .

“These supplies are designed
to last the occupants for ap-
proximately two weeks.” he
said. ‘‘There is also a radioac-
tive materials detection device
located there.”’ Maloney added.

Belk Dormitory is one of fil-
teen fallout shelters located on
the Davidson campus. Ac-
cording to the’ Fallout
Preparedness Committee's
1971-72 year-end report. Belk
Dormitory has fallout shelter
space for 2874 people.

About 1250 spaces are
stocked. The cartons had been
accompanied by water drums
until permission was received
from state and county offices of
Civil Defense to dispose of these
cans

ness Committee. Maloney
Stated. “The assumption is
made that in non-blast areas,
one hour and fifteen minutes
will be available in which to
take cover in a shelter area.”

Maloney indicated that the
fallout shelter program became
of primary public interest
during the Cuban Missile Crisis

AN ANALYSIS

By BO PHILLIPS
Staff Writer

The fight for retiring
Congressman Charles Jonas’
seat between Republican Jim
Martin. a Davidson College
chemistry professor and former
county commissioner. and
Democrat Jim Beatty. a
Charlotte businessman and
state legistator. is shaping up
as a race which will confuse the
voters in Mecklenburg. Lincoln
and Iredell counties rather than
offering them a clear choice.

The candidates refuse to dif-
fer sharply on any _ issues.
thereby posing a dilemma for
those casting ballots in the 9th
District on Nov. 7.

Jim Martin is running a cam-
paign similar to those being run
by other Southern Republicans
this year. He readily admits
that he is counting heavily on
the apparent Nixon victory to
propel him into Congress. and
he has likewise attempted to
associate Beatty with George
McGovern.

Polls out of Raleigh show.
however. that statewide
Democrats. from senatorial
nominee Nick Galifianakis to
General Assembly candidates.
do not stand to suffer markedly
by Sen. McGovern’s” un-
popularity. Any attempt by
Martin to label his opponent as
leftist and radical will probably

as unsuccessful as previous
omilar attemps by Repub—
licans (Jim Holshouser. mod—
erate gubernatorial candidate
and Jesse Helms, reactionary
senatorial candidate, were
both ridiculed by state press
when they called their oppon—
ents leftists).

If Martin is to retain this seat
for the Republicans. he must
speak to the issues more clearly

and force his opponent to do the
same. Martin's conservatism

(“Possession of marijuana:

should remain a felony” and
“Congress has hurt © the
President's Vietnam policies )
certainly has appeal in this part
of the state.

An aggressive. issue-oriented
October campaign could well be
the key to a Martin victory in

November.

Civil defense boxes hold two weeks of food.

Hopefuls Offer No Clear Choice

Jim Beatty, the former world
record holder for the mile run,
is running from the national
ticket as hard as he can. In an
effort to disassociate his can-
didacy from the McGovern
ticket. he has labeled himself
‘a compassionate conserva—
tive.”

Beatty has said that he will
vote for the national ticket but
is quick to add that he is not par-
ticularly fond of George
McGovern. Out of political
necessity, Beatty has become a
classic example of the fence-
straddler.

He has hedged on the highly
controversial busing issue in at-
tempt to hold on to his strong
black support while appealing
to the moderate and con-
servative Democrats. so vital to
a Beatty victory.

From May through Sep-

tember. Beatty has relied quite
heavily on his organization and
his charm and popularity as an
ex-athletic hero. In this close
race, smiles and four minute
miles will not be enough. Beat-
ty must also speak to the issues
and prove himself to be a
desirable alternative to Rep.
Jonas’ successor-designate.

Beatty's positions on Vietnam
(withdrawal contingent upon an
agreement for the release of
prisoners). marijuana
(decriminalization of penalties)
and amnesty for draft evaders
(service in Peace Corp. VISTA.
etc.) will be under attack by
Martin, and he must stand firm
on those issues in order to hold
fast to his natural Democratic
constituency.

Hopefully. this disappointing
campaign will begin to speak to
«ne people during the final mon-

th before the election. Martin,
counting on Nixon Coattails,
seems cautiously optimistic.
and Beatty. relying on large
chunks of the black, youth and
labor vote. says that ‘our
position remains solid. but I
know we will have a highly com-
petitive situation this fall.”

A Davidson student. after
hearing a Beatty-Martin debate
in Perkins Auditorium this
spring. remarked that the only
difference between the two was
their preference’ in the
presidential election.

Now even that distinction
seems to have melted away.
Neither of these men deserve
the 9th District seat until they
address themselves squarely to
the problems facing the district,
take political risks, and offer
the voters a real choice.

‘Women At Yale’ Shows Coed
Problems At Male Stronghold

A Review
By PETER GRAHAM

Fall of 1969 brought radical |
change to the Yale University
campus. For the first time
women were admitted to the un-
dergraduate’ colleges.

Graduate sociology students
Janet Lever and Pepper Sch-
wartz were right on hand to
chronicle that first crucial year
of coeducation, and they have
written “Women at Yale:
Liberating A College Campus.’

Beginning in the Dark Ages of
Dink Stover, Gothic halls. prep-
pie poise and three piece suits.
Lever and Schwartz delineate
those customs and necessities
which created a cohesive, all-
male Yale where Woman in-
truded only in the guise of date-
ornament-sexual outlet.

Proceeding from generalities
to specifics, subsequent chapt-
ers deal with the social insti-
tutions characteristic of single-
sex schools. Notable among
these rituals are the Mixer and
the Weekend. Drawing heavil)
upon transactional! analysis, the
authors dissect the Mixer
mentality and its precarious
ego-building games.

Lever and Schwartz move on
to 1969. the year of coeducation.

They observe that, thanks to the
Mixer and its extended coun-
terpart. the Weekend of Road-
trip. Yale men objectified the
female. With women relegated
to the status of occasional
playthings. Yale men found it
difficult to accept their new
coeds as classmates and
associates.

The girls, in turn, wrestled
with their own problems. While
most of the coeds, refugees
from Eastern girls’ schools,
found Yale __ intellectually
stimulating. they discovered
that for a time at least, they
lacked a place in the school's
social life.

Furthermore, many were
perturbed by the goldfish-bowl
prominence of their roles and
were frustrated that necessity
and the Yale man labelled them
“‘women” first and ‘‘students”’
second.

However, new male-female
relationships began to emerge,
the date-friend dichotomy
weakened, and the men and
women of Yale moved toward a
more natural, less formalized
social system.

The authors, both proponents
of women’s liberation, assert
that much change is still
needed, particularly in student

hero Michael

concepts of feminity and bona
fide equality of women; but
they predict success for
coeducation at Yale.

Time passes, and since the
1963-70 school year of Schwartz
and Lever's study much has
transpired. Yale's first coed
freshmen are this year's
seniors. Yale's class of ‘73 has
seen the rise of a collective
feminist movement far more
militant than = anything
suggested in the Schwartz-
Lever survey. They have also
witnessed the solid en-
trenchment of coeducation at
Yale.

As budding social scientists.
Lever and Schwartz exhibit
precision in sampling, in-
terviewing. documenting, and
their love affair with statistics:
and “Women at Yale"’ seems
sound enough from a
sociological standpoint.

Fortunately, the book is also
extremely readable. The
authors write effectively. in-
terspersing description and
analysis with quoted excerpts
from interviews and selected
comic strip adventures of folk
Doonesbury .

Read and enjoy “Women at
Yale.” Maybe it can help us
liberate Davidson.
