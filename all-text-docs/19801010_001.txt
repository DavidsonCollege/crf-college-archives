Fred Stair ‘39, newly elected
chairman of the Board of Trus-
tees, describes the state of the
College in glowing terms but
expects the ‘80’s to be a
“turbulent decade.”’

‘‘We are living with some
economic and political realities
some of us have never seen
before,’”’ Stair said.

Stair was elected chairman at
last week’s Board of Trustees
meeting. He replaces outgoing
Chairman Warner Hall effective
Jan. 1, 1981.

Stair, a minister, has been
president of Union Theological
Seminary in Virginia since
1967. He was a Davidson
Trustee from 1954 to 1959, was
elected again to the Board in
1974, and has served on it since.

Stair thinks one of the Col-
lege’s major challenges is over-
coming the financial problems
wrought by inflation. ‘‘All of us

educational administrators |

have had to fight inflation,” he
said.

Stair emphasized the need for
“conservation” and ‘‘economiz-
ing’ in College policy. He said
faculty salaries were ‘‘an ob-
vious point” in economizing.
‘‘(Salaries) are fairly equitably
distributed. The problem is that
they’re not keeping up with
inflation.”

proposed curricular changes,
the new computer center, and
recommendations for moderni-
zation of the Biology Depart-
ment. ;

A proposed draft of the
minister to students’ job de-

- scription approved by the Trus-

tees calls for changes in the
minister’s relation to the Col-
lege and to the Davidson Col-
lege Presbyterian Church
(DCPC), College President
Samuel Spencer said.

The title of the position would
change from assistant minister
to chaplain, Spencer said. The
College would have an ‘‘explicit-
ly stronger role’ in directing the
work of the chaplain.

The proposal also calls for
‘‘more financial involvement by
the church’’ in supporting the

Martin turns

By SALLY CAMPBELL

Republican Congressman
James Martin declined an invi-
tation from The Davidsonian to
speak at a campus forum with
his Democratic opponent, Eco-
nomics Professor Randall Kin-
caid. Kincaid accepted.

Martin and Kincaid are run-
ning for North Carolina’s Ninth
District Congressional seat,.
which represents Mecklenburg,
Iredell, and Lincoln counties.

Kincaid is on a two year leave
from the faculty. Martin was a
Davidson chemistry professor
until his election to Congress in
1972.

Kincaid’s press secretary
Cathy Roche said she was
“very, very upset” that Martin
turned down the invitation. She
said it is ‘‘essential that voters
of the Ninth District hear both
men on their views.”

down forum invitation

Martin’s campaign coordina-
tor John McAlister said Martin
had to decline the invitation due
to ‘‘tremendous scheduling
problems...(Martin) would have
liked to do it if possible.’’

The invitation left it to
Martin to choose a date for the
forum.

Religion Professor Alexander
McKelway, an “interested wor-
ker’’ in. Kincaid’s campaign,
said the reluctance of incum-
bents to discuss issues with
their challengers is not unusual.
“But many do feel it’s their
duty to engage in public debate,
he added.

“‘We’re not ducking debate,”’
McAlister said, pointing out
that Martin will meet Kincaid in
a debate at the Charlotte Cham-
ber of Commerce on Oct. 29.

WTVI will also air a Half-
hour program featuring the
candidates ‘Oct. 31 at 9 p.m.

Procter and Gamble is advising against ‘the use of their Rely tampons.

According to WTVI producer
Tom Clipp, two reporters will
ask questions, but there will be
no discussion or rebuttals be-
tween the candidates.

Roche said Martin is now
turning down all invitations for
joint appearances with Kincaid,
including a program at Myers
Park Methodist Church in
Charlotte and a Senior Scholars
forum.

McAlister said Martin's tight
schedule has forced him to
decline many invitations, not
only those for joint appearnaces
with Kincaid.

Because Martin cannot re-

‘ turn to his district until Con-

gress adjourns, McAlister said,
he has only one month in which
.to campaign.

Kincaid, McAlister pointed
out, has been free to campaign
since June.

Biology dept.
awaits new
equipment

By ANNE GOODWIN
Staff Correspondent

Davidson's Biology Depart-
ment lacks modern micro-
scopes.

Most of the microscopes now
in use date back to the 1940's,
according to Biology Professor
Jerry Putnam.

These ‘‘profoundly outdated '
microscopes, Putnam said, are
adequate for freshman-level
courses, but lack the modern
features necessary for advanced
study.

Despite good care, some of
the microscopes are in need of
repair, Putnam added. But
parts are no longer sold.

Putnam estimated that new
microscopes would cost $50,
000. Such microscopes are stan-
dard equipment at most state
universities.

Associate Dean of the Fac-
ulty and Chemistry Professor
Nicholas Burnett described the
problem as one of priorities. In
past years other projects, such
as the renovation of Martin
Science Building, have taken
precedence over the purchase of
equipment for the Biology De-
partment, Putnam said.

However, Burnett said, the
needs of Biology Department
are now high among the Col-
lege’s priorities. Burnett said he
expects the Biology Depart-
ment will receive a significant
amount of new equipment with-
in the next 12 to 18 months.

At last week’s meeting of the
Board of Trustees Burnett out-
lined plans for modernizing the
Biology Department in general.
For instance, Burnett called for
increased emphasis on course
work in molecular biology, ac-
cording to College President

would require “enormous out-
lays of money,” primarily for
new equipment. Electron micro-
scopes needed for molecular
biology courses would cost
$200,000, Spencer said.
