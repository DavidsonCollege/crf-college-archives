NUMBER 5

Formation of a New Women's Eating House Discussed

. By Tom Price

After several years of informal
discussion, talk surrounding the
formation of a new eating house is
beginning to get serious. Last
Monday a forum was held in the
Chambers Gallery to gauge the de-
gree of interest and to discuss the
process by which a new house
would be formed.

Approximately 75 women at-

tended the meeting. The forum
was led by agroup of students who
were all supporters of the new move
and represented all three female
eating houses. On the panel were
Jennifer Humphrey (Warner Hall),
Bess Murchison (Rusk, Commit-
tee for Women’s Issues), Annie
Adams (Patterson Court Council
President, Rusk President), Sarah
Way (Rusk), Tammy Wynn
(Spencer President), and Monica
Lide (Warner Hall President).
The panel discussed their rea-
sons for supporting a fourth house
and then explained the details in-
volved in making the new house a
reality. Following their initial
comments, questions were fielded
from the audience.
Arguments for the new. house
centered around an over-crowding
of Rusk and Warner Hall and a

desire for more representation for
women in the Student Government
Association (SGA) and the Patter-
son Court Council (PCC).

Annie Adams (Rusk President)
commented that her
house currently has
over 180 members.
There have been
waiting lists at both
Rusk and Warner
Hall and the houses
are unable to acco-
modate any more
members.

Assistant Dean of
Admissions Leslie
Marsicano has ex-
pressed her concern

that the lack of room
at Rusk and Warner

Hall may “threaten
the. self-selection
system.” Annie Adams echoed
this concern and believes “‘a fourth
eating house is just assuring that
women have enough choices.” The
committee expressed its hopes that
the numbers would “balance out”
and that there would eventually be
four houses of roughly the same
size.

Representation is a question
because each Patterson Court

house is granted a representative
for the SGA and the PCC, Cur-
rently there are six male represen-
tatives from the court and only
three women representatives. A

fourth female house would obvi-
ously close the representation gap.

At the forum a handout was
distributed whichasked two simple
questions. First, “Wouldyou con-
sider joining anew women's eating
house and second, “Would you be
interested in helping with the or-
ganization of a new house."

"If thé campus response to the
questions is positive, the commit-

tee hopes to create an identity for
the house and make it an option
during self-selection in January.
The house would then become ac-
tive at least socially in the spring
and _ then begin
functioning as an
eating house next
fall. If everything
goes as planned
the new house
would occupy the
old Warner Hall
house on Patterson
Court.

Many see the
move as inevi-
table. Dean Mar-
sicano shares this

beliefand said that
a fourth female

eating house “will
happen sooner or
later.” Although some feel that
this year may be too optimistic a
goal for creating a new house, the
growth in overall student enroll-
ment (from 1400 to 1600 by the
end of the decade) seems to indi-
cate that another eating house will
soon. be formed.
Aside from the numbers, many
want to see a‘fourth female house
because of the disproportionate

sizes of the three current houses.
Spencer is currently much smaller
than Warner Hall or Rusk. Both
Warner Hall and Rusk are so large
that it is becoming difficult to feed
and accomodate their members.
Laura Cunningham, a Junior
member of Rusk, said, “If you are
five minutes late for dinner now
there is a good possibility that you
won’t get any food. There are just
somany people eating down there.”

The panel explained that at this
point the committee is looking
towards forming a “standard or
generic house, not a special inter-
est house.” In the past there have
been proposals for establishing a
vegetarian or co-ed house. Dean

Marsicano and the members of the
committee believe that a “special

interest house” would have less of
a chance of succeeding based on
past events at Davidson. If, how-
ever, a large group of people voice
their interest in having some sort
of specialized house then it would
be entirely possible.

Establishing a new eating house
is notan easy process. The college
has certain guidelines that must be
met. The new house must have

New Recruitment Program Replaces SGA Weekend

By Tom Koonce

In a move to involve all ac- *

cepted Davidson applicants, the
annual spring SGA weekend has
been replaced by a new program
that is as of yet unnamed.

_ Instead of having only a select
group of applicants visit campus
for a weekend as the past SGA
weekends have done, this new
program will attempt to bring all
applicants and their parents to
Davidson for a day. This will take
place on the last two Saturdays in
March.

According to Admissions
Counselor Lisa LeNard, “Every-
one (accepted applicants) will be
invited to two different Saturdays

Klein Captures CASE Award

Dr. Ben Klein, a Davidson
professor of mathematics since
1971, has been selected North
Carolina’s top professor by the
Council for the Advancement and
Support of Education in Washing-
ton, D.C. He was selected from a
field of 13 nominees who repre-
sented 10 different colleges and
universities,

Thisis the second major award
that Klein has earned in the past
year, Last November he was
awarded the prestigious Thomas
Jefferson award for teaching at the

Fall Convocation. According to

- Robert Williams, vice-president for

and will pick one to attend.”

During that day both parents
and applicants will attend sessions
and observe panels about life at
Davidson. There will be sessions
for only parents suchas talks about
counseling, advising and financial
aid. Applicants will attend SGA
coordinated sessions about student
activities. These will involve the
Union, the Y SSC, Patterson Court,
student publications and others.

Applicants will also be able to
talk with department heads and
learn about Davidson academics.
During the day there will also be a
talk given by thechair of the Honor
Council to introduce applicants to
the Honor Code.

academic affairs, the accocolades
are well deserved.

Describing Klein’ sprdfssoni-
alism Williams said, “His class
preparations are meticulous and
his office door is always open to
students. He is utterly conscien-
tious and devoted to the welfare of
Davidson College.”

Perhaps one of the keys to Dr.
Klein’s success is the enjoyment
he derives from teaching math.
“Teaching is even more fun now
because I’ve taught most every-
thing before and have areasonable
idea about what will work and
what won’t,” he said.

Klein cherishes the close con-

The move to replace SGA
Weekend with this new program is
not a sudden change but one that
has been in the working for the past
three or four years. SGA Weekend
started 15 years ago as a scholar-
ship weekend for a small group of
scholarship students. :

It gradually grew beyond this
original intentand became too large
a program to be handled on one
weekend. Last year the number of
students asked to attend was cut to
around 70 applicants.

The problem was therefore one
of fairness. The Admissions Of-
fice wanted a more fair way to
invite all accepted
applicants instead of

just a select few. They realized
that this could not be done in one
weekend.

The Admissions Office also
wanted to better include the par-
ents in the spring program. Ad-
missions Counselor Barbara Bixby
said, “Parents are a larger part of
the decision than they used to be
because of financial reasons, so
they need to be more involved and
well-informed.”

LeNard said that a lot of
schools have adopted this one-day
format and most have had a posi-
tive experience in doing so. She
said that the Admissions Office is
discouraging hosting on this week-

end without going so far as to say
that applicants can’t stay on cam-
pus.

On the question of why have
this type of program LeNard said,
“Davidson is the right choice for
most people here and this can let
prospectives decide if this is the
right place for them.” She said that
the hope is that this day will give
applicants a broad view of
Davidson while also concentrat-
ing on specifics.
