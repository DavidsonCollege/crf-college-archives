Outler Gives Insights
On College Students

By TOM COLVIN

Davidsonian Associate Editor
Dr. Albert Outler, the second speaker in this year's
Otts Lecture series, presented his insights into the pres-
ent student generation in a special DAVIDSONIAN in-
terview Tuesday. The noted theologian responded en-
thusiastically to the questions set forth during the in-

terview.

When asked to characterize
the religious atmosphere among
college students today. Dr, Out-
ler pointed out that the atmos-
phere varies from campus to
campus.

think the principal characteris.
tic of this generation is _ its
awareness or semi-awateness of
the magnitude of the crisis of
our times and of the complex:
ity of social change. Most stud-
ents know that the world is

“But speaking generally,” he
said, “it has now been taken
for granted that religion be-
longs somewhere or other in
our serious considerations. We
are past .the time when there
were bright boys who said only
emotional crippies turn to re-
Jizion.

"The college student knows
there is something in religion
which he should understand.
He wants religion to be in-
tellectualiy respectable and
morally relevant, and he
wants to know where he fits
into it.”

Dr. Outler pointed out that
the question is no longer wheth-
er religion is necessary. “Ten
years ago.” he said, pulling from
his own experience, “I had to
argue for religion. Five years
ago, I found many students who
had latched onto religious pane-
ceas. The peddlers of pane-
ceas arent as prominent now
as they were, We've settled
down to find out what the
score really is.”

In response to a question
about the student attitude. to-
ward intellectual. inquiry, Out-
ler said that there are colleges
and universities, usually ivy
league. he noted. where there
is a great. deal of “intellectual
excitement, thrust and pres-
sure.” Yet, there are other
schools where the students aré
motivated by the desire to get
“the requisite facade for their
subsequent life in business.”

iY

He said, “The worst thing |
see around is the substitution
of compétition for grades in
place of the thrust of intel.
lectual curiosity and inqui-
ry.” He noted the pressures
of the college and graduate
S450] adnilsison as being
among the factors behind the
problem.

Another question put before
Dr. Outler was. what are the
special characteristics of this‘
student generation?

riding along just a few feet
from the edge of disaster. They
may not. think much about this,
but they know this is the situa-
tion.

“And they know how diffi-
cult it is to affect social change,
This. makes them more -indis-
posed to get involved in radical
or revolutionary movements.

‘There’s another thing
which hasn't been rightly no-
ticed. A generation ago the
student came to college un-
der control of his parents and
of society. In this respect,
he was still a child. College
was where he made his break
and established his independ-
ence.

“Since then. for various reas-
ons, the average college stud-
ent has already made his break
from the domination of parents
and family ties before he comes

to college. By the time he gets
to-college. what he wants is to
find some alternative security.
He wants to find ways to fit in
and belong.

“College isn’t as exciting a
place now since it is not now
a place of adolescent revolt.”

Dr. Outler said that the great
challenge facing students today
is “how to live meaningfully
and productively in a world that
may blow up anytime,

‘The main thing is to under-
stand himself. understand the
world. understand God:and His
expectations of us and to con-
tribute something to the neigh-
bor and to the human -herit-
age.”

FIRST SETTLERS

At about the same time as

southern Africa was a popula -
