‘THE.DAVIDSONIAN

ELECTION '92 MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1992 5

ELECTION COVERAGE

students, faculty and staff are also
very important to me. That’s
throughout the administration,
including the trustees.

I feel like there are a lot of mis-
conceptions about what the stu-
dents believe is going on around
school. In other words, my view of
what Dean Terry says, or Dean
Williams says might.not be what
the students think, and I want to
clear up some of that.

I hope to provide more oppor-
tunities for communications by
asking people like Dean Williams
to express himself in the paper. I
think the paper is a great vehicle
and that it needs to be used more
frequently. When difficult issues
confuse the campus, I think writ-
ings from administrators can help
clear things up. I’d also like to see
administrators come to some SGA
meetings.

Davidsonian: We asked the last
candidate about the race-relations
problems on campus this year.
What do you think of this issue?

Cunningham: I think that there is
definitely a problem. This year,
many black freshmen have left or
are leaving, and I am not happy
about that. As far as the SGA is
concerned, through the Solidarity
Committee, and through the Coun-
cil on Minority Affairs, we hope to
plan some events and work with
the Presideént’s Council on Minori-
ties to bring minority faculty to
Davidson and to bring more mi-
nority students. That’s hard when
racism is a problem all over the
nation, and J think Davidson is
feeling the repercussions of the na-
tional problem.

Anthony Foxx

I feel that I must be candid as I
bring forth my reasons for running
and aspirations for the coming year.
I rather risk losing your vote now
than losing your support later.

With respect to our place in the
history of this institution, my phi-
losophy is simple: we must take
care to plan for the future. Most of
the high priority student issues have
festered for years andare only now
being addressed. For example,
tolerance has become a buzz-word
this year, but, in my experience, in-
tolerance has been an issue every
year. We have to look beyond tol-
erance to understanding.

My vision and hope in these
times is that the student body push
Davidson to greatness and prog-
ress, from the bottom up. The dis-
tinguishing element of Davidson
student government politics is its
grassroots nature. This, too, dis-
tinguishes the campus as a whole.

We must emphasize and over-

emphasize this as we govern our-
selves, and the Student Govern-
ment Association President for
today must have the courage and
persistence to facilitate the sound
resolution of pressing issues.

The alcohol quagmire is acase
in point. I think that the Dean of
Student’s office, the Faculty, and
the Board of Trustees are right:
something must be done. I do not
think that itis a popular view among
students, but the truth is that some-
thing will be done. The question,
then, is simple -- will we impose
stiffer limits on ourselves, or will
we wait restrictions to be handed
tous? If we take sincere action to
resolve the problem, I believe that
Ican convince the Board, the Fac-
ulty, and the Administration that it
will be better than heavy-handed
restrictions from the powers that
be.

Indeed, the entire history of
the institution isapproaching aturn-
ing pointin these regards as well as

others. What role will students

play? What will the Davidson
experience mean for suceeding
generations of students? What will
it mean as we carry our degrees
into the hustle and bustle of the real
world?

We share a common stake in
Davidson. Acommon thread binds
us to one another as individuals, as
students, as members of this cam-
pus community, and as depart-
ments of the College. The SGA

President is weak without student
approval and active support, and
these are the qualities I want us to
nurture in the coming year. If we
want Davidson to continue its
missionand becomea greater place,

we must. Thus, it is not simply
your vote I seek to win on Tues-
day; I want to win you over.

Davidsonian: If you advocated
the restriction of alcohol on cam-
pus, do you think that such action
would drive students to drink else-
where, and lead to a greater num-
ber of alcohol related accidents? If
so, what would you do about it
then?

Foxx: That’s very hypothetical.
What I would like to do is to sit
down with the entire Patterson
Court Council to discuss what we
could do realistically to remove
some of the college’s liability, and
to curb the problem of students
arriving to class hungover.

To answer your question,
though, if that were to happen, I
would have to foster that role of a
campus or society of judges. One
in which people are responsible
for one another. I don’t think it'll
come to that, but if it did, we’d all
have to be a bit more responsible
for each other.

Davidsonian: Could you explain
tous why you left the Honor Coun-
cil?

You were elected your fresh-

‘man year to serve throughout your

time at Davidson, but last year you
left the Council to join the SGA.
Why exactly did you make this

‘move?

Foxx: My reasoning was very
simple, really. I wanted to become
more involved in student life.

I felt that the Honor Council

was more of a functional role, but,
as a member of the SGA, I could
move into a more pro-active role.

Davidsonian: Can the school be
sure that your commitment to the
SGA is solid?

Having watched you before
leave an office once you saw that it
was not pro-active, can we be sure
that you’ll give a year’s worth of
commitment?

Foxx: The obvious answer to that
question is yes.

Davidsonian: What do you sce as
the causes of racial tension at
Davidson, and what can the SGA
do to case these constraints?

Foxx: Again, I’d like to point to
my rathor ambiguous spcech.
While it doesn’t hit on any one
thing in particular, it does mention
some very broad-ranging ideas.
Onc of those is that we have to take
more individual responsibility.

Ihave witnessed a greatdeal of
racial tension and conflict during
my years at Davidson, and I think
that in the roles I’ve taken as a
Freshman Senator,an Honor Coun-
cil member, and as Junior Class
President, I’ve looked to a very
broad based constituency: one of
white people and black people.

Being black myself on a pre-
dominately white campus is a very
complex role to play, but it’s one in
which Ihave beenable to reconcile
those problems, and I believe that
the Davidson student body is intel-
ligent enough to work the prob-
lems out.

SGA Vice-Presidential Candidates

‘Alden Smith

Election time again. It seems
like we can’t go anywhere without
being attacked by cheesy flyers. I
hope we don’t get so caught up in
who has the cutest campaign slo-
gans that we fail to become in-
formed. Getting things done on
this campus doesn’t have to do
with being cutesy. Your one vote
for Vice-President of the SGA re-
ally is important. So why vote for
Alden Smith? Admittedly, there
are three exceptional candidates
for the position. All three of us
have occupied positions of leader-

ship on this campus and we are all
hard workers.

My pastexperienceon the SGA
is what believe sets me apart from
the other two candidates for Vice-
President. In my two years as a
senator for the SGA, I have devel-
oped a good working relationship
with the senate as a whole. I know
exactly what the commitment of
being Vice-President involves.

Even more importantly, I have

worked with both Laura and An-
thony on the SGA and the Council
on Minority Affairs. Youcan’t go
wrong with any of the three candi-
dates for President, and I would
work well with each of them.
1992-’93 promises many chal-
lenging issues. First, minus grades.
You are going to hear a lot about
this issue during the next year. At
least if I’m elected you are. My
feeling is that minus grades need to
go. Lagree that we need to assess
both the positive and negative

“aspects of having minus grades,

but still -- minus grades need to
go. I believe that there is enough
concern among students to make a
change. We just need the right

‘kind of leadership to organize our

frustrations and push proposals on
the administration. Be in Cham-

bers Gallery on Wednesday at 8:30
PM. ;

It is just as horrendous a crime
to take away exam periods. Re-
ducing the amount of exam peri-
ods threatens our unique system of
self-scheduled exams. A threat to
self-scheduled exams is a threat to
the effectiveness of our Honor
Code. Oh, and yes -- the Honor
Council. I agree that the campus
needs to be more aware of what’s

- going on behind closed doors, but

I don’t believe that a jury system is
the answer. Some students are
concerned that they have no voice
in who is going to be Chairperson
of the Honor Council. I’m one of
them. BUT, to avoida mere popu-
larity contest, I believe that the
members of the Honor Council
should nominate several students
among them to be later voted upon
by the student body. The most
threatening problem, it seems to
me, is the easiest to take care of. In
a word -- ignorance, As a student
body, we don’tknow enough about
the workings of the council, A
mock trial at Freshman orientation
would be a good first step toward
education.

_We are about to hear a lot of
talk about the alcohol policy.

”

Believe it or not, some influential
members of our college commu-
nity would like to see a dry cam-
pus. This scares me. Do I think
there is a problem with irrespon-
sible drinking at Davidson? Yes.
Do I think an alcohol-free campus
is the answer? No. Unfortunately,
many Davidson students are going
to drink excessively no matter what
the alcohol policy says. I would
muchrather have my friends stum-
bling back to their dorms thandriv-
ing back drunk from Charlotte. I
believe that keeping the current
alcohol policy is the safest choice,
and the administration will not
compromise our safety without a
fight from the SGA.

Racial tension. It exists. We
absolutely cannot tolerate some.of
the instances of these past few
months. I am committed to the
task of changing some of the un-
feeling and apathetic attitudes of
many students toward minorities.
As the only memberof the Council
on Minority Affairs who is not a
minority, I have learned that the
problem rests with those of us in
the majority. We are simply not
reaching out enough to those dif-
ferent from us. That some students
believe that F.L.A.G. should not

receive money from the Activities
Tax Fee embarrasses me. F.L.A.G.
has just as much right to receive
money asany other SGA chartered
organization. If you disagree, you
can obtain a refund of the percent-
age of your tuition going toward
F.L.A.G. (about 2 to 4 dollars).
That’s about all out of me for
right now. Please understand that
you are making a difference if you
vote on Tuesday. Also be aware
that you are making a difference if
you don’t vote. If you are unfortu-
nate enough not to know one of the
three candidates for Vice-Presi-
dent, I urge you again to vote for

. experience. I would appreciate

your vote on Tuesday.
Davidsonian: The Vice-Presi-

dent’s job description has that
person operating independently
from the President in a number of
ways, committee oversight being
chiefamongthem, —

But, if elected, you are still the
VP and not the President. Shoulda
conflict arise between you and the
President will you defer to him or
her or will try to assert your own
position?
