Study Weighs Benefits
Of Subsidized Sports

A cost-benefit analysis of sub-
sidized athletics at Davidson
College was written last spring

“Different members of the
class made contributions to the
report and we assembled the
final product at a picnic table in
my yard.” explained Avinger.

The report addresses itself to
the over-all desirability of sub-
sidized athletics to society in
general, evolving from David-
son's intercollegiate athletic
programs.

Broadly speaking. the report
weighs the potential economic
benefit from the athletic

program at Davidson to the .

general public. rather than its
benefits to Davidson as a
private institution.

The investigators found that.
surprisingly. the won-lost
record of the football team or
the basketball team did not
correlate with fluctuations in
alumni contributions to the
general fund.

In fact, the general climate of
business conditions has been
the major explanatory variable
of alumni giving.

The study also concluded that
the fund raising of the Wildcat
Club is a positive influence on
alumni giving. Speculation that
alumni giving to the Wildcat
Club might enter into com-
petition with the contributions
to the general tund is— ap-
parently talse

The combined contributions
ot both the general tund and the
Wildcat tund exceed the collec-
tions which would have accrued

sence ot the Wildcat Club

The survey seemed to show
that economic benetits derived
{rom membership in_ the
Southern Conference were
relatively negligible.

The report cited ease of
scheduling. booking and
training of officials. and post-
season competition as at-
tractive elements as members
in the Conference, but stated

repeatedly ‘‘the benefits are

probably negligible.”

Looking into the costs of sub-
sidization, the study seemed to
show that there was a disparity
between the demonstrable
scholarship need among
athletes, versus students at
large.

In 1971-72, for instance, 285

students. representing about 28
percent of the — student
population received an average
financial aid of $1497.85. By
comparison, 88 student athletes

81 percent of the football team

were based on financial need as
proved by the Parent's Con-

Avinger warned against in-
terpreting the conclusions of the
report as “the final word.”

**We had to work around some
limitations in our data and
some’ inconsistencies in
gathering research. although
over-all. it is a good report.” he
said.

INTO DRUGS
Andy Lamas found 2000-3000% prescription profits.

amas Studies Pharmacy Prices

By TOM AINSWORTH
Contributing Editor

Freshman Andy Lamas is in-
to drugs. That might be an in-
criminating statement except
for the fact that there is nothing
illegal about it and that the
drugs involved are bought by
millions of people daily.

Lamas, in conjunction with
the Political Science depart-
ment course 127. “State and
Local Government’’ under
William Jackson, made a study
last term of retail prescription
drug prices in Charlotte and the
surrounding area

He also studied the North
Carolina State Board ot Phar-
macies tor their organizational

and heensing practices and
their, restrictions on. trade
policies

As a result ot his) study.

Lamas is under the opinion that

there exists a pharmacological
monopoly in the retail drug
business in favor of the in-
dependent drug stores. thereby
causing a gross inequity to the
consumer over prices.

His reasons become clearer
once the make-up of the State
Board of Pharmacies is con-
sidered.

“The State Board is com-
posed of five men, appointed by
the governor on rotating terms.
a new one each vear.” ex-
plained Lamas. “‘All tive are
either owners of. or have in-
terests in. independent drug
stores as opposed to the chain
stores ‘such as Eckerd’s or
REVCO

“In addition, the State Board
members are usually recom-
mended by the North Carolina
Pharmaceutical — Association.
which also represents mostly
independent store interests
The monopoly extends even
higher until it gets to the
national level.”

“The State Board has the
power to revoke a pharmacists
license. which comes up tor
renewal each vear. uo he os
found to be an alcoholic. drug ad-
dict. or if he is tound guilty of
acts of ‘gross immorality” un-
der a clause in the Board's
provisions

“The State Board. however.
interprets ‘gross immorality” as
relating to the advertising ot
prescription retail drug prices.
which consequently aids the in-
dependent stores in charging
their prices

“The people I talked to in
Charlotte representing the
chain stores want to advertise.
but can't because of the ‘gross
immorality’ clause.

In doing the study. Lamas got
a doctor to write oul a prescrip-
tion tor him, in this case it was
for 40 tetracycline pills which ts
a general antibiotic He would
have it tilled. and then say that
he didn’t have enough money to
pay tor the pills. thereby getting
his prescription back

This enabled him to study the
pharmacist’s actions and not
have to buy any drugs

In the 15 stores he visited.
Lamas said that the prices tor
his prescription varied from
$1.36 to $8.00

Independent drug stores were
the ones who charged the most
tor the prescription. and the
chain stores the least

“Independent drug stores
clear more of a profit on drugs
than do chain stores. mainly
because of the State Board's in-
fluence.’ said Lamas.

“The Carolina Cut Rate Drug
Store was the most expensive.
charging me $8.00 for the
tetracycline pills. The next day.
though. I went to the same
store. handed the prescription
to a different druggist. and he
only charged me $6

“Another store did the same
thing. giving the same prescrip-
tion to me this time within 15
minutes of each other. and
varying between $4.00 and $6.00
respectively

Lamas pointed out that there
are really two ditterent ways in
which a druggist can till a
prescription. Using tetracycline
as an example. the generic
prescription pills are the same
as the chemical tetracyline

C22H24N208 and come
marked that way in the bottle

The brand names ot the same
pill which are manutactured by
reputable drug tirms. have
names such as SUMYCIN or
ACHROMYCIN. = Chemically.
they are the same as the generic
pills

The ditterence between the
two is that the brand name
drugs have ditterent catalyzing
agents in them ‘allowing them

to enter the blood stream more
quickly) which may differ from
company to company. The only
major difference between the
two however, is in the price.

“A generic tetracycline pill
will cost anywhere from one
tenth of a cent to one cent per
pill.’ stated Lamas. “‘but the
brand name_ pills for
tetracycline. SUMYCIN and
ACHROMYCIN. cost four and
five cents respectively.”

By claiming to be interested
in pharmacology as a
protession, Lamas was able to
get behind the counter in 12 ot
the 15 drug stores he surveyed
and view how the pharmacist
tilled his prescription

In one store. Lamas was able
to see the bottle trom which the
pills were obtained. The phar-
macist in question filled the
prescription trom a generic bot-
tle and then charged him $6.00
— the brand name price

“You've got to give the phar-

macist some leeway tor
overhead and protit.’’ observed
Lamas. “but a 2000-3000 per

cent protit is a bit too much.”
“Several vears ago. pills used
to be color coded so that the doc-
tor and patient could be able to
tell the difference between the
same drug.” continued Lamas.
“Now however. all the pills are
