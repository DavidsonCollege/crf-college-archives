On Myopic Whims

Student body feeling concerning the
maintenance of certain conduct reg-
ulations in the student body constitu-
tion has hardly changed from what it
was before the abortive referendum
in December.

Neither has the import of next
Tuesday’s re - scheduled balloting
changed from what it was originally.

The item of students’ jurisdiction
in their own affairs is of the utmost
essence in the upcoming vote. It

should not be sacrificed by the whims
of myopic voters.

At the same time, this re-evaluation
of rules governing conduct should see
the elimination of certain provisions
which are indeed unnecessary as well
as unwanted.

The sheer application of prudence
next week will. of course, insure the
continuation of responsible student
government on this campus.

A Solution At Hand

One of the thorniest and most per-
sistent problems to plague college
campuses currently is the lack of ade-
quate parking facilities. Davidson,
alas, is not without its vexation in this
area.

Unlike other schools who are per-
plexed with a space problem. how-
ever, Davidson has the Jand area and
exact site to expand the parking fa-
cilities for students.

Last year several students request-
ed that the college develop the erod-
ing land east of Richardson Dormitory
into additional parking spaces. Col-
lege officials obtusely answered that
a parking lot would ruin the appear-
ance of the landscape there.

What could be more unsightly than
the dilapidated laundry building and
the old “slave quarters,” which are
now used as headquarters for the col-
lege’s security officer.

Or perhaps the. college is content
to let the red clay erode and wider
pathways be worn by the fraternity
men on their treks to meals on Pat-
terson Court.

The glaring lack of parking areas
for student automobiles is evident
from a count of the spaces reserved
for permit holders. Approximately 180
parking spaces are reserved for the
nearly 400 automobiles which are reg-
istered in.the bursar’s office to upper-
classmen:

The matter is even more compli-
cated this year by the fact that for
the first time freshmen are allowed
to register automobiles on campus.
Yet, instead of expanding the parking
facilities. the college further antagon-
ized the situation by making the area
behind the gymnasium off-limits to
permit holders.

Also, students with non-registered
automobiles (vehicles kept on campus
less than two weeks) can conceivably
park much closer to a dormitory than
a student with a permit-sticker on
his car. The closest parking lot: for
“permit-holders-only” is further from
Richardson dorm than is the fraternity
court area, in which non-registered
automobiles may be parked.

Student body feeling is further di-
vided by the jealousies of many stu-
dents who receive financial aid from
the college and are thus penalized by
being prohibited from keeping a car
on campus.

The college’s banal explanation for
such a penalty is that students who
receive a stipend on account of fi-
nancial need should _not_be allowed
the “luxury” of an automobile on
campus. We consider it far more lux-
prious to have the college janitors
awaken us and make up our beds daily
—a pleasure which every Davidson
student enjoys.

Perhaps those students on financial
aid should be further penalized by
having -no janitor service.

Seriously and quite obviously, an
automobile is becoming more of a
necessity every day, especially on the
isolated Davidson campus.

If the college can afford to build
a new baseball diamond—just so that

‘the old field can be.used for parking

on the few football Saturdays here
each. year, it can easily give some at-
terition to a problem which is becom-
ing more vexatious each week with
the growing number of automobile
registrations.

We would be the first to agree that
the addition of badly needed parking
facilities is no life-or-death problem
for the college. But the solution to
the inequity which does exist is plain-
ly evident and should be effected
without useless delay.

We disagree with the college offi-
cials who claim that a parking lot
would ruin the appearance of the un-
used land mentioned above.

Instead. a. well-developed parking
facility, adequately landscaped and
paved. would enhance that area of
the campus and replace the rain-
washed gullies and foot-worn paths
which cover the area now; also, it
would certainly improve the tempers
of nearly one-half of the student body
who wonders just what the advantage
is of being an automobile permit
holder.

Vietnamese Quandary

The student survev on page one,
although somewhat limited and nec-
essarily not a totally accurate reflec-
tion of Davidson opinion, indicates
nevertheless that Davidsonians do fa-
vor U. S. involvement in Viet Nam.

Students and faculty members
alike see defeat of the Communists
there as ultimately important for the
security of the rest of the free world,
including the U. S. We endorse this
view.

We do regret, however, that the
Vietnamese issue on the national
scale has, like the “civil rights” con-
troversy, been clouded with so much
emotionalism and demagoguery.

Although a substantial portion of
the emotionalism, i.e., the labeling of
all opposition to the war as unpatri-
otic, un-American, “pink”, etc., favors
much of the same policy we endorse,
we feel that only a rational analysis
of American foreign policy and ration-
allv-reached conclusions concerning
what this policy should be are the only
valid determinants to what U. S. policy
in Viet Nam should be.

The policy planners of the U. S.,

by using such an approach, do, how-
ever, reach the same conclusions as
the flag-wavers:

(1) the military power of the U. S.
is necessary at present to prevent con-
trol of the South Viet Nam by the
Communists and

(2) the containment of Communism
in Southeast Asia at least within its
present limits is important to the se-
curity of the free world, the U. S. ulti-
mately included.

Those opposing U. S. involvement
should do so by refuting these conclu-
sions, rather than by bypassing ulti-
mate implications and consequences
and just making unrealistic statements
about the evil of fighting, the immor-
ality of U. S. intervention in a foreign
country, and the desirability of turn-
ing our other cheek to the enemy.

We strongly approve of U. S. mili-
tary involvement in Viet Nam; how-
ever, our concern here is not to justi-
fy this involvement, but to affirm the
need for debate over the relevant is-
sues involved instead of controversy
fanned by irrational and irrelevant
emotionalism.

Dear Editor: .

John Todd's domination of the
sports editor’s column in the
last issue was to say the least
ill-fated.

Duke may or may not be a
great basketball team. They did
not prove it against UCLA. The
zone press did not make two na-
tional champions. The men who
ran it did, and the two who an-
chored it — All-American Gail
Goodrich and Keith Erickson —
have graduated.

In addition, the Bruin’s leading
scorer in pre-season contests
missed both Duke games with a
stomach ailment. Duke won both
games handily, but the opposi-
tion was a far cry from top-
notch.

Before being too impressed too

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Jones Defends Roundballers, Hits Duke

by Duke's destruction of UCLA‘s
quite mythical top national rat-
ing, it is interesting to note what
the Blue Devils did in the face
of two local pre-season evalua-
tions. They lost to South Caro-
lina, predicted last in the ACC,
and defeated Virginia, predicted
next to last, by only three points.

If Davidson's young basketball
team (5-1 when this column was
written and 10-2 and 4-0 in the
conference now) is ‘‘embarras-
singly green,’ the embarrass-
ment is worth having. If the
“medicine’’ of Johnston Gym is
“unstable” apparently victory is
not. The senior author of this
column still has not seen the
Cats lose there while he has
been a Davidson student.

I am writing this letter in ap.

it was very wonderful and
thoughtful of them for writing a
few lines to us soldiers.

I got as far as the tenth grade
in high school, and now that I
see how mature it can make a
person, I wish I had stayed in
school. But as you can see, I
learned many things the hard
way.

I wish that many more col-

‘cations that Davidson is stra-
tegically avoiding Duke (or ahy-
body) are scarcely worth con-
sidering. One remembers when
Davidson played the nation’s
first and second ranked teams
in the same week (beating
Duke).

One remembers playing Duke
at Durham two years ago when
we were allowed only 200 split-
up seats.

The guarantee we offered
Duke for one game in Charlotte
three years ago was greater
than that offered us for the last
three games combined in Dur-
ham.

It is fact that Davidson beat
Duke the only time they have
played us away from Durham
while Driesell has been here,

and that since that time they
have refused to play us away
from Durham. Last year they
refused to play us anywhere and
have shown little interest in our
contacts since then.

The athletic department
spokesman referred to in the
column is not named, but he did
not come from the basketball of-
fice and he was not Dr. Scott.
If there is burden of proof here,
it is on Duke — not Davidson.

If it is possible momentarily to
overlook the factual inadequa-
cies of this column, one ‘might
still suggest that there are more
appropriate places to read of
Duke’s alleged greatness and no
less appropriate place to read
unconstructive criticism of the

LOADED WITH SANTA’S GIFTS and twice as
much as was taken away, most Davidson students
returned this week to face all those papers and re-
views left undone and unprepared. The average
DC gentleman had two reviews and a paper due this
week and declared he just couldn’t get started.

It’s this “getting-started” business that is hard-
er than both reviews and papers combined. Once
Started the work usually becomes fun—after all most
of us do enjoy studying to some degree, no mat-
ter how much we may complain.

But it’s getting-started: A trip to the Union, a
cup of coffee there and a few short conversations
...a trip to the library, read a few newspapers and

a glance at the new books section . . . a trip

to the

house, maybe to listen to the ball game but always
a couple of ping-pong trysts or a few hands of bridge
and much conversation on or off the phone.

_ Finally because the night is shot anyway, the
Wildcat heads up the road with a reverent promise

to do it all tomorrow without fail.

Plenty of time.
HALLELUJAH!

FORMAL RUSH IS OVER!

Probably the longest rush season in Davidson his-
tory is finally past. This year’s attempts at reform
of the Greek system have proved chaotic and unsatis-

factory to friend and foe alike.

Everything from

Saturday rush parties over three months to bid-’em-
by-mail showed the signs of improvisation.

The successive weekends of rush parties were
much -too-drawn out. Having the frosh visit all the
houses initially was a good idea, but next year let’s
try having parties on sucessive nights so that the sea-
son can be shortened to about a month and a half.

The IFC regulations

on contact between frosh

and upperclassmen have proved themselves ridicu-
lous. This thick head initially supported them but

then he too gave up in disgust.

You know where

this “salutory-greeting-off-campus” business can go:
to the same place this “salutory-greeting-on-cam-
pus” plus “‘no-visiting” foolishness is going.
Bid-’em-at-home was a good idea but it too got
fouled up in 12 different addresses, several days of
no mail delivery, and a frightful amount of confu-

sion. Southern Bell and

AT&T were the only real

winners here—one IFC representative bet he had

$75 of phone calls.
over Thanksgiving?

Wonder if this could be done

There is little to be gained by blaming anyone.
We've learned by experience and changes will be
made for next year. But instead of making plans
from the idea preventing contact between frosh and
upperclassmen, why not emphasize increased con-
tact? Please—no more Segregation.

COMMENT TO REFLECT UPON:
CHORTLE BY AN ANTI-GREEK PROF: “Fra-

ternities are really fixed now!

If fewer frosh than

usual pledge up, they’re on the way out and we can
put in sophomore rush and finish the job. If more

or the same percentage pledge u

, then they're still

too strong and we can put in soph rush anyway.”

(Editor’s Note: Mr. Jones is
certainly entitled to his opin-
ions; however, the spokesman
referred to in the column was
Athletic Director Dr. Tom
Scott, who told THE DAVID.
SONIAN again this week,
“1 would say there Is no pros-
pect in the near future,” for
@ basketball game between
Davidson and Duke.

We call the readers’ atten-
tion to this week’s column on
page four.)

Graham

Dear Editor:

Security within the status quo
has become the goal of the
Board of Trustees and Admin-
istration. The problem with
Davidson generally is what so-
ciologists call institutional in-
ertia.

Older professors are so. much
a part of it. that they are. un-
aware of it: younger professors
are in the process of being dis-
enfranchised by the trustees (TI
understand there is even an in-
formal ‘‘blue light’ being con-
ducted now by the Administra
tion).

As far as the students are
concerned, brighter freshmen
are aware of the system with-
in three or four weeks: more re-
tarded students realize it in their
third or fourth year when it is
too late. Anyway, by that time
most of them. are more concern-
ed with their role within the so-
cial WASP’s nest from which
they emerged, their education
being a meaningless formalism.

. BUREAUCRACY

It was a Davidson professor (a
new one) that said educational
institutions are often good train-
ing for a bureaucracy, for a job
at one desk in a vast mechanis-
tic network interconnected with
in-and-out baskets.

No doubt this: same type of
realization prompted Mario
Salvo and the Free Speech
Movement at Berkeley. David-
son may not be as large and
impersonal as the Berkeley cam-
pus, but the cherished institu-
tions are equally immobile. So
what do we do?

RECRUITING

If. as THE DAVIDSONIAN re-
ported, applications are running
somewhat behind. why not begin
intensive recruiting in New Eng-
land or the Midwest? Davidson
could use a little fresh blood.

_
=) a r) :
| Why not computerize registra-
' | ion at the beginning of each
¢q semester?

Why not. have competent up-
perclassmen teach freshmen and
sophomores some of the more
basic courses? Plenty of schools

the size of Davidson do this..

It would break the tedium of
canned" lectures and facilitate
smaller classes and more dis-
cussion. Professors, after all,
have no monopoly on knowl-
edge.

SELF-STUDY

The Self.study recommended
(so I am told, for it has been
successfully kept from student
scrutiny) provisions for faculty
research? What about student
research (not just for seniors
with a 2.5 average)? Most uni-
versities are grappling with the
“publish or perish’ situation,
which indicates the antiquity of
Davidson thinking. in relation
to other colleges.

And what about the rules
which students detest and are
now formally protesting. Many
of them are appendages of Chris-
tian doctrine.

TRUSTEES

_The trustees may have a legal
right to impose what they do.
as Rev. Morris has suggested,
but I do not understand how
they rationalize Davidson's arti-

ficial legalism in terms of their _

own “Christian stewardship.”
The ideal of this religion, the
Bible department assures me, is
agape.

If it is therefore concerned
with the individual and his wel-
fare, it should be concerned
about the “spiritual welfare” of
Davidson students. Hypothesize
a counter-example: take any
bright, young freshman.

Suppose he Is initialy neutral
to Christianity but that because
of required of Bible courses,
vespers, and chapel he becomes
a bitter atheist. Using the irra-
tional calculus of some moral
philosophers and many Chris-
tlans, Christianity has then fail-
ed, since at least one individual
has been led astray by the
very system that seeks to stim-
ulate it,

The trustees may feel the duty
to provide an accessible Chris-
tianity for all students. How co-
ercively prescribed religious ob
servances make of the church a
symbol for ritualistic obeisance
must make authentic Christians
sick.
