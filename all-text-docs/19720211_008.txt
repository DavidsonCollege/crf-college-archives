an undisputed lead in the South-
ern Conference regular season

The 'Cats avenged an earlier
defeat by Joe Williams’ hordes

greater feeling of confidence
among the team members.

Lowry Sparks Wildkittens

To Fourteenth At Furman

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

In Tuesday night's freshman
basketball game, in which the
now 14-1 Wildkittens pulled out
an 89-86 win from Furman. io
an overtime period, the biggest
man on the floor was also the
smallest.

5-10 guard Jim Lowry. after
suffering a knee injury midway
through the second period, came
back in the second half, and
scored nine of the eleven points
in the five minute overtime seg-
ment to clinch the game for the
‘Kittens. Lowry scored fourteen
points in all.

As to his injury, team physi-
cian Dr. William A. Davis Jr.
could only define it as a “‘se-
vere sprain”, with no specific
damage occurring to any liga-
ments or cartilage.

Ironically, Tim Spencer, Low-
ry’s replacement at the guard
position, also suffered much the
same type of injury to his knee
in the contest, in which his liga-
ments were strained, according
to Davis. Davis is hopeful that
the two will be back in a week.

Until recently, however, Low-

games, he has averaged 15.5
points, being high man in the

Besides being an excellent ball
handler and passer, Lowry has

Yet it was in the Furman
game which Lowry demonstrat
ed his talent, after cinching the
lead with less than a minute to
play in the extended time with
a lay-up drive, on which he
was fouled.

By making the subsequent
free throw, Lowry put the Kit-
tens in an 87-82) advantage,
enough to insure victory.

Minkin pointed out the im-

over the season and expressed
optimism on the 'Cats outcome
in the tournament, where David-
son and Furman are expected
to meet again.

“Itll be a lot easier to do
next time,” he stated. ‘‘Besides,

them by 20."
