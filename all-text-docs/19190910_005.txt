The Why of the Three
Dollar Y. M. C. A. Fee

Collection Progressing Nicely;
Total Soon to Be Announced.

On account of some confusion in re-
gard to the collection of the three dol-
lar Y. M. C. A. fee, a copy’ of the res-
olutions unanimously adopted by the
student body of last year is given  be-
low:

“Realizing the supreme importance of
maintaining a ‘Y’ secretary during the
coming year, we, the student body, do
hereby promise tu contribute the sum of
three dollars per man toward his salary.
provided:

“(1) That a board of directors be
elected to control the collection of this
money and to guarantee the remainder
of his salary.

“(b) ‘That this money not be col-
lected before the opening of the colle-
giate year 1919-20.”

It can be seen from this resolution
that this assessment is entirely independ-
ent of any collegiate fee. “The Y. M.
C. A. beard of control is a student or-
ganization elected by the students to
finance the various activities of the “Y.”

‘lhe plan adopted by the students was’

to raise three dollars from every man in
college and to secure the batance through
outside subscriptions.

Due to the carly registration on Mon-

day and ‘Luesday it was impossible to |

see every man at the time he matricu-
lated. However, no one need feel
slighted ar overlcoked, as they will be
appreached later. ‘To relieve this buard
frem any extra trouble in collection,
those who have not paid are urged te
hand this amount as early as possible to
any member of the b:ard. They are as

MINISTERIAL BAND HAS
GOOD GETAWAY.
FINE PROSPECTS

The Ministerial Band held its first
meeting last Sunday at two o'clock. Phe
band gives promise of having a_ fine
“year.” For one thing, there were over
thirty ofd members pre.ent, whereas last
vear there were only thirty members,
both old and new. Last year, too, the
band met at a very inconvenient hour,
and was interfered with. by other meet:
ings, such as the World Forum. “The
World Forum will be discontinued this
year and conflicts with other mectings
will be avoided as well.

The student volunteers will be work-
ing under a handicap until Dave Rob-
erts, the presidest, returns. However,
the vice-president is taking hold in his
place, and the, volunteers will go right
on with their work in spite of difficul-
ties. Bitzer, the chairman of the infor-
mation committee, has been working this
summer, and has collected a great deal
of literature dealing with missions and
mission fields.

On next Sunday at a time to be an-
nounced later the Ministerial Band will
hold its second meeting and all candi-
dates for the ministry are urged to be
present.

PARAGRAPHS BY OUR “Y"”
SECRETARY, MR. MILES

The golden rule is a pretty good kind
of a motto to tie up to in college life
as well as in the regular scheme of
events in that world outside the aca-
demic halls. So as we start a new year
we might do well to take a “look see”
at this old adage and see where it hits
us, and we believe that every man, if
he is fair with himself, will agree that
it is essential to the best kind of col-
lege atmosphere.

For the upper classman we might put
it this way: ‘Do unto others as you
would have had them do to you when
you first hit the Hill.” Think back on
those old days and figure out what you
would have appreciated at that time
and then practice it on the next Fresh
you see. Thoughtfulness and considera-

tion go a long way towards making this
world a cheerful place to live in. When
you come to think of it, selfishness is at
the bottom of most of the trouble
around, and a little of the opposite
thing, or unselfishness, is a good remedy
for the aforesaid evil. So let us think
of the other fellow and we will all be
happier.

The Freshman wants to practice the
same thing. Put yourself in the place
of the upper classman and try to visual-
ize his viewpoint. Remember how you
felt as a senior in prep. school and
then it will come home tu yuu that the
older men have better judgment in
handling the affairs of the college. ‘They
are mere intcrested in you and your
welfare than you think, and if you pull
with them the best results can be ob-
tained.

Therefore, with this unity of pur--
pose and reaching after a mutual un-
derstanding, we will have the best year,
ever an this old campus.

Record Attendance at
First “Y” Meeting

Plenty of “Pep” and Life Shown;
Let’s Keep It Up.

[It was good to see so large attendance
at the first Y. M. C. A. meeting of the
year Sunday night. Certainly ag man!
owent away disappointed, for after some
special music and geod “healthy” sing-
ing, Mir. Miles made a most interesting
‘and instructive talk. .

In his talk Mer. Miles showed how
, Joshua and Caleb stood up against the
other ten spes, for what was right.
; Just so.” said he, “should the student
on Davidson campus have the courage.
{to stand up for the right.”

He should have the strength
courage for the coming year's work,

Mr. Miles continucd by saying that
j the prospects for a prosperous year were
better this fall than ever before, that
every student: should have high ideals
with the ccurage and strength to carry
them out.

When Coach “Bill” left, pruspects
for football seemed poor, but new with
our new coach and so large a student
body, Davidson can do even greater
things if the student body makes up its
mind to do so. Phe goal for which
everyone has been striving will sarely
be reached if everyone is strong and of
goud courage, “The four years a fellow
spends at’ Davidson will be much more

and

profitable if he has the courage and
strensth to do what is right.
In closing, Mr. Miles announced

that a player piano had been purchased
and would be placed in the “Y" rest
roont this week. Every man in college
will be expected to use it.

Reorganized Y. M. C. A.
Plans Great Things

With Bob Miles and Dwight Chal-
mers at the helm, the Y. M. C. A. «is

ready men are beginning to learn the
way to the “Y" room at the gymiasium |
with its player piano, victrola, games,
and writing material. Besides this,
there are gotng to be movies every Fri-
day night. They are Paramount Art-,
craft pictures and that is enough said.

The Sundays will be well filled up.

The weekly “Y" meetng will be at 7
o'clock Sunday night.

The president and cabinet are plan-
ning big things and all prespects point:

It has been apreed by the two liter-

custom of having Junior societies tor
Freshmen up unt ‘the beginning of the

tur many years and has proven very

Freshmen as well as the whole society.
On account of the late start last year
it became necessary to deviate trom this

audience who would be hardly as criti-
