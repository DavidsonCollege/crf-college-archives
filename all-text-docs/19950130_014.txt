Wildcats stomp fl
Marshall 78-63

Ewodo shows up the Daredevils

By Matt Pitzer

Callit the Wildcats’ Den, Call
it the House of Horrors. Call it
what you want. But lately, oppo-
nents have come tocall Belk Arena
dreaded.

The men’s basketball team has
won 21 of its last 23 games at
home, the latest an impressive 78-
63 win over Marshall Saturday
night.

Brandon Williams attached
those descriptions to the team’s
home court following Saturday’s
game, expressing confidence that
the Wildcats feel very good play-
ing at home.

“We’ ve got to let people in the
Southern Conference know that
this is a terrible place to play,”
Williams says. “Here, we’ll make
a statement every game that no-
body will match our intensity.”

Saturday night, everything
clicked for most of the game for
the Wildcats, who improve their
overall record to 1 1-6, including 4-
1 in the Northern Division of the
conference, good enough fora first
place tie with East Tennessee State.

The Thundering Herd (10-7,

2-3) had been the early season sur-
prise in the conference, winning
their first six games of the season,
but have now lost their last four in
arow. The team is playing under
new head coach Billy Donovan, a
Rick Pitino understudy at Ken-
tucky for five years, and has put in
a place an up-tempo, run-and-gun
style of play, featuring the fast
break, ‘the three-pointer and full-
court pressure defense.

Saturday, with exception of a
five-minute span in the secondhalf,
Davidson successfully handled ev-
erything Marshall threw at it and
even gave the Herd a little dose-of
their own medicine, clearly in-
spired by the boisterous crowd
which was fired up itself by the
Bud Light Daredevils slam-dunk
team,

“This was a great game,” Wil-
liams says. ‘““We had a great crowd.
Playing a tough out-of-conference
schedule, playing on the road, it’s
nice to come home to this.”

points, and George Spain added

Wrestling team trudges on with determination

By Richard Glenn

The Davidson wrestling team
has moved into the busiest part of
its schedule and has shown signs
of improvement. Last weekend the
team traveled to Washington and
Lee for a tournament with several
conference opponents. Despite sev-
eral first round setbacks, the team
wrestled well and came away with
three wrestlers placing. “As ateam
we shook off our first round losses

and wrestled very well in the sec-
ond round, and that allowed us to
place some wrestlers,” said junior
co-captain Sean Harvey. Freshmen
Andy Sterling wrestled as well as
he has all season and came away
with a third place finish. Jake
Hamilton, another freshmen, also

wrestled well and ended up third. -

Also earning a third place finish
was junior Jesse Kenner. The Wild-
cats ended up in fourth place as a

team and came back from Virginia
to face a tough week of practice.
On Saturday the team trav-
eled back to Virginia, this time to
Longwood, where they faced Vir-
ginia Tech and Apprentice Col-
lege. The team didn’t do as well as
they would have liked and ended
up losing both matches. Co-cap-
tain Derek Spencer provided the
best performance of the day, and
Hamilton managed to pin one of

his opponents. The team is still
bothered by some nagging injuries
and with a healthy lineup the out-
come could have been better for
the Cats.

This week the team is plan-
ning on working hard as they pre-
pare for one of the toughest matches
of the year when they travel to
Atlanta to face Duke, Georgia
State, and Ohio State. All three of
these teams are formidable oppo-

nents, but if they keep up their
spirits they should be able to help
themselves in the long run. “Al-
though we have a lot of young guys
we have kept up our intensity and
are starting to come together as a
am,” adds Harvey.
The future looks promising

for the Cats as they prepare for the
Atlanta tournamentand the Alumni

Reunion weekend to be held at
Davidson on February 11.

Old Dominion duo leads women’s lacrosse in preseason

Nancy Hillger, a 1993 graduate of Old
Dominion, has been promoted to the posi-
tion of head coach of the women’s lacrosse
team for the upcoming season.

Hillger, who starred in both field hockey
and lacrosse at ODU, came to Davidson in
the fall of 1994 as an assistant coach for both
those sports. When the previous lacrosse
coach, Kersten Kimel, left for Duke, Hillger
took over and has been preparing her team
for a tough schedule that begins at the Wil-
liam and Mary Tournament during the first
weekend of spring break.

Hillger is from Rehobeth Beach, Del.,
where she lived before earning her degree in
sports medicine from ODU. She spent one
semester interning for a specialty in cardiac
rehabilitation and has begun studying for
her masters in exercise physiology.

Recruited by ODU for field hockey,
Hillger had never played lacrosse until she
arrived in Richmond. Her lacrosse career
began when Sue Stahl, a national recruiter
and coach of U.S. women’s lacrosse, came
to ODU. She mostly played the third man

position, which is basically a midfield de-
fense position.

After graduating, Hillger wanted to
coach both field hockey and lacrosse, and an
opportunity to coach at Davidson seemed
like a perfect fit for her.

She brought in Jen Deckleman as her
assistant. Deckleman also played both field
hockey and lacrosse at ODU before gradu-
ating last year.

Hillger sees good reason to be optimis-
tic about the this season. It is the first time
that the team will play a full 17-game sched-
ule, with the schedule dotted with tough
‘opponents including Richmond and Lehigh.

“The Davidson student-athlete is quite
conscious, and my players have given a
tremendous effort and demonstrated great
character,” Hillger says. ‘““They have been
the type of athletes a person loves to coach.”

Although the first match isn’t until
March 4, the squad has been practicing since
returning from Christmas break. With a
new coach and a challenging schedule, the
women’s lacrosse team is expecting big
things for 1995. .
