Doctor Richards took his text last
Sunday from Mark 1:1, and explained it
as symbolic of the Presbyterian Progres-
sive Program, especially in regard to
Stewardship. He showed how covetous-
ness is seen all thréugh the Bible and
has always been punished more terribly
than any other crime and that from
Bible times until now the sin of covet-
ousness has been ruining men. He ask-
ed this question,
when he starves because you failed to
donate a few dollars?”

Davidson used to have a bicycle club,
many of the old “Quips and Cranks” have
a section for this club in them, and even
one college report to Fayetteville Preés-
bytery describing the vicinity of the col-
lege mentions the fact, that for cight
months of the year the roads around
Davidson were inviting to bicyclists

In the mind of every serious
thimking college man there arises a
question—“What am I going to do
after graduation?” This question
presents a serious crisis. It de-
mands a definite decision.

In an unusual degree the Life
Insurance business combines the
opportunity for conspicuous bus-
iness success with the opportunity
for real social service. Here is a
profession that is eminently worthy
of consideration.
