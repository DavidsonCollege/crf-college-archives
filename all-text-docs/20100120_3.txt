Renowned philanthropist Doris Buffett visits campus

News Editor —

Last Tuesday afternoon, nationally rec-
ognized philanthropist Doris Buffett visited
Davidson to speak about her charity, the Sun-
shine Lady Foundation.

Born in 1928 in Omaha, NE, Doris Buffett
calls herself a child of the depression; and it
is growing up in the depression to which she
attributes her passion for philanthropy, not-
ing specific instances when she found herself
wishing to help the people around her.

Buffett recollected scenes of the home-
less in Washington, DC and a Save the Chil-
dren correspondence that sparked her desire
to give. Years later, in 1996, Buffett founded
the Sunshine Lady Foundation with her in-
herited trust fund to do just that: help those
in need.

“We look for people in distress through
no [cause] of their own,” she said.

‘Since its inception, Buffett’s foundation
has donated over $80 million to causes such
as battered women’s shelters, those people
with illnesses unable to afford medical care,
educational resources for battered women,
their children and those in jail.

“We do not give hand-outs, we give
hand-ups,” she said. “We have to have col-
laboration.”

Buffett’s policy of collaboration is evi-
dent in every aspect of her foundation, be-
ginning with the very first request for a grant.
After receiving a request for help, Buffett
said that her foundation’s team ensures the
need is valid and pressing.

“There are so many lovely people with
poignant needs that we can help,” she said.
[The need is] just stark—it comes at you
and you think, ‘That could happen to any-
body.’”

When it comes to awarding money to in-
dividual situations, Buffett talked of the “‘no
nonsense” approach she is known for.

“We gauge what we give on the need,”
she said, noting that amounts can range from
$20,000 to $30 million. “These are not dead-
beats, these are people with bad luck.”

Over the years, Buffett’s foundation cre-
ated the PEACE awards to recognize pro-

domestic violence victims
as well as_ the Women’s
Independence _— Scholar-
ship Program (WISP) for
the education of victims
of domestic violence,
which has since graduated
over 1,000 women. Addi-
tionally, the Change Your
World (CYW) scholarship
was started for children
victims of domestic vio-
lence and provides them
with the basic education

needed to succeed.
“Education is never a

chance,” she said. “It al-
ways works.”
Buffett noted that

though the students go-
ing through programs
like WISP and CYW may
need extra mentoring, re-
sources or attention, the
chance for them to get an
education is often not a
“second chance,” but a first.

The payoff, according to Buffett, comes
not with material gains or recognition, but
with statistics such as the 40-plus percent of
students in WISP who maintain a GPA of 3.5
or higher or the children in CYW who aspire
to be doctors and lawyers.

“Tt doesn’t take much, and the rewards
are enormous,” she said. “I love things that
make a definite difference in the life of some-
one else. “

In 2003, Buffett teamed with Davidson
and Ken Menkhaus’ “Philanthropy and the
Non-Profit Sector” class to give students a
hands-on “learning by giving” experience,
donating $10,000 for the Political Science
class to distribute to a non-profit of their
choice, after soliciting grant applications
from numerous organizations.

“The students argue a lot about how to
spend the money and that’s a good sign,” she
said. “I was really thrilled with the spirit on
this campus.”

Buffett has created “Sunbeams,” or volun-
teers who use her grants to make a difference
in their communites.

“{She is] one of nation’s greatest phi-

philanthropists,” President Tom Ross said of
Buffett. “Her passion[s]...really do not end
with grant-making.”

“My aim is to have everybody win,” she
said. “We do what we have to do, and some-
times it isn’t very much. We judge it ona
case-by-case basis.”

“They’re invisible people,” Buffett said
of the 10,000 letters processed from needy
individuals over a three year period. “No
