Belk possible
Republican
gubernatorial |

| candidate

Former Charlotte Mayor John M.
Belk, a Davidson graduate of 1943,
member of the Davidson’ Board of Trus-
tees, and a‘lifelong Demoérat, has been

- asked torun as a Republican inthe 1984

.North.Carolina Governor’ s race..

Charlotte Lawyer James Cole,
claiming: to represent ‘the State GOP,
says that he contacted’ Belk oii Aprif 27
about the possibilty oF rn for gov-
ernor.

“I went: to John Belk and wé had a
very private meeting,” said Cole. “He
was pleased, very humbled, very happy
about it.”:Cole.said Belk would make a
decision by mid-June.

Belk is the president of Belk Stores

“Services. Cole said Belk must consider

his business commitments. “He’s trying
to resolve a couple of things about his si-
tuation,” said Cole.

Belk’s only reply to the offer: “I
think they’ ve got a good party.”

N.C. Republican Party Chairman

David Flaherty said he knew of the -

meeting between Belk and Cole but that
the GOP did not initiate it. “Jim Cole
was representing Jim Cole,” he said.
Belk expressed an interest’ in run-
ning for the 1984 Governor’s race last
year. But he has not publicly indicated a
deeper interest since then. Speculation
about Belk’s possible candidacy centers
around his feud with Charlotte mayor
Eddie Knox, a‘ highly probably Demo-
cratic candidate for governor.
Belk and Know have disagreed on
downtown. revitalization ; and. the fnam-

ing of the new airport.

Stell Receives |
NEH Grant

On ya Tues evening, Lance Stell, asso-
ciate professor of philosophy, lectured
on group rights versus individual rights.
The talk was especially appropriate at
this time, because he has recently been
awarded a fellowship to study the same
topic at the National Humanities Center
during academic year 1982-83.

Stell’s research. will.examine what

he considers the dangerous increase in_

the claims of interest groups to rights

which’ entitle them to proportional rep-

resentation in legislatures, and to ‘sub-
stantial shares of the desirable positions
in the “job market. Stell believes that

only individuals have basic rights, and

that “the potential impact of this shift to-

ward recognition of group rights rather

than individual rights is massive.”

He asserts that rights provide pro-
tection for the individual against the
fluctuating voice of thé majority. “Be-
cause an individual has: a right to ex-
press a political opinion even when un-
popular, the law protects him or her des-
pite the fact that this minority opinion
would surely be silenced if collective
considerations were all that mattered,”
he said.

Stell also maintains that an empha-
sis on group rights tends to. underscore
social differences rather than diminish
them. “We used to think, rightly I be-
lieve, that a person’s race or.sex was ir-

- relevant for deciding whether some pol-

itical burden was properly imposd or be-
nefit properly provided. Now, some-
how, many have come full-circle to the
view that these traits are a ground of
merit or demerit,” he said.

Stell. wants to demonstrate current
legislative and judicial‘ inconsistency
with respect to group rights; and plans
to compile his research into a book ten-

. tatively.titled Rights,.Groups.and.Indi-

vidualism. Stell, a. Hope College gradu-
ate, has taught at Davidson Bince 1976.

Davidson College ‘will award over

three hundred degrees to graduating se-

niors and three honorary degrees to dis-
tinguished citizens at this year’s Com-
mencement ceremonies. The ceremo-
nies will take place in front of the Dana
Science Building at 10:15 A.M. on Sun-
day, May 22.

In accordance with tradition and for
the sake of expedience, there will be no
major address during graduation. North

- Carolina Governor James Hunt already

presnted this year’s main address at
Spring Convocation.

Ms. Jonnie A. McLeod, a professor
of Human Development and Learning at
UNC-C, will receive an honorary Doc-
tor of Science degree. Dr. William A.
Boyce (class of ’40), head of the Section
on Urology at Bowman Gray School of
