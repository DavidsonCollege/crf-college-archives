Drinking Age

(Continued from page !)

The problem arises because houses do
not want to eliminate either alcohol or
freshmen from their parties.

The Patterson Court Council and the
Inter-Fraternity Council met last Tues-
day to create a unified policy that would
satisfy the minimum requirements of the
law. They are currently working on a
guideline for freshmen.

Several issues were discussed as
problem areas: large beer parties, small
liquor parties, beer trucks, tables with
bartenders, and the possibility of under-
cover agents trying to get a drink.

The groups reached an_ informal
agreement on how to deal with large
band parties. According to Spaugh, a
student will have to bring his school
identification to verify his age and his
student status. Those legal to drink will
receive a hand stamp at the door. Beer
kegs will remain unsupervised but will’
have a sign in sight warning minors of the
possible consequence to the house and
the violator. Bartenders were ruled out
because if a minor made it past them the
bartender would be fully liable.

Another problem will be the small
parties that serve liquor. The legal age
for liquor in North Carolina is 21 and this
too will be enforced in a crackdown. In

this limit, but houses will now take meas-
ures to restrict and monitor these parties.
Two possibilities are admittance by invi-
tation only and checking I.D.s.

Beer Trucks
Beer trucks frequently used at very
large parties present new problems be-
cause of problems in checking their use.

Beverly Hart said she “expected people
to get their hands stamped on their own
responsibility. Davidson is a special
place, and I think the students would
obey this.” Members of the houses
would generally be on the lookout for un-
stamped students drinking. Such vio-
lators will be asked to put their drink
down.

“We don’t want to be obnoxious
about it,” said KA president Sam Hay,
“but we have to protect ourselves.” If
anyone is convicted of “aiding and abet-
ting in the delinquency of a minor,” the
maximum sentence is two years and/or
$2,000 fine. Added Hart, “I don’t want
to go to jail. It’s not worth it to me not to
protect myself.”

Perhaps the least controllable parties
are on the big weekends. Students bring
potentially underage dates to these eve-
nts. In fact, agent Barefoot said that
agents, probably underaged women,
would try to be served in the Patterson
Court houses. However, many students
remain skeptical about this kind of en-
forcement. Commented Phi Delta Theta
Social chairman John Ruppenthal, “The
feeling around here is that these are just a
lot of scare tactics. I can’t see them send-
ing sepresentatives. cyery where.
can’t see them really enforcing it.”

“Rush will be dry,” said Fiji social
chairman Mark Steiner, ‘tas far as
freshmen are concerned. It’s ridiculous

T just_

to think you won’t have to change any-
thing. Of course, we’re going to comply
with it. And we won't try tricks to get
drinks to the underage. I’m not going to
jail.” Hay concurred, “Most people are
pretty serious about this law.”

But most thought Patterson Court as a
whole would not be hurt by the law.
“What we have down here doesn’t center
around alcohol,” said Hay. Hart agreed,
“It’s just going to take a little getting used
to. So why try to fight it? Instead, try to
live with it. Next year it won't be a big
deal.”

900 Room: No Pitchers

Pritchard, who makes policy deci-
sions regarding the sale of beer and wine
in the 900 Room, has decided to stop
selling beer in pitchers.

Ata recent meeting, the Union Board
Policy Committee voted unaninimously
to uphold Pritchard’s decision.

“His name’s on the license and
they're his bartenders,” said Union Di-
rector William Brown. Pritchard
explained that “it’s impossible to moni-
tor who is drinking from a pitcher.” He
does plan to drop the price for a cup of
beer by about five cents to “make it more
attractive.”

Pritchard also hopes to offer more
products to students under 19. He and his
staff are exploring the selling of food or
non-alcoholic “near beer” to attract those
who cannot legally drink.

The 900 Room has been checking
IDs and stamping hands since the begin-
ning of the year. The bartenders look for
a stamp before they will sell beer. “The

idea is to make it manageable.” said
Brown. “I don’t think it’ll chase folks
away.”

Dean Ross said the College was very
much in favor of retaining the present at-
mosphere of the 900 Room, which meant
not shutting out 25 percent of the stu-
dents. “We want to preserve the 900
Room as a place where students could
mix with faculty and staff informally.
Beer isn’t necessary for that. The 900
Room really is a fragile privilege,” Ross
said.

Freshman Halls

The solution is fairly clear on
freshman halls. According to Freshman
Advisor Katie Dagenhart, hall coun-
selors are forbidden to use the $75 social
money given to the hall by the College
for alcohol. This removes all institu-
tional responsibility for violations of the
law.

More importantly, the College will
“definitely not make the hall counselors
into policemen,” said Dagenhart. “It is
the freshmen’s responsibility to obey the
law.”

Most agree that if freshmen drink in
their rooms that remains an private mat-
ter.

The owners of Peregrine House and
Giorgio’s, two Davidson restaurants that
serve beer, said they were going to check
the IDs of customers more carefully, but
no other changes. They will continue to
sell beer by the pitcher.

Phi Society

(Continued from page |)

said that admitting women is better for
both Davidson women’s and the Soci-
ety’s interests. “We wouldn't be evil
people if the Society didn’t admit
women, but it wouldn’t be fair not to,” he
said.

ATO

(Continued from page 1)

enough students could certainly support
ten houses — the current number includ-
ing ATO — but he said that determining
a definite number of viable houses was
difficult.

Currie said that with 39 or 40 mem-
bers it is difficult to run a house, and last
spring’s small self-selection results were
little help to ATO. He also pointed to the
trend toward part-time eating at a house
as a possible cause of problems.

Last spring the Business Office is-
sued suggested minimum membership
requirements for eating houses, but Cur-
rie pointed out that ATO remained open
last spring even with fewer than the
suggested 60-member minimum.

“We want to help and yet not be run-
ning the houses,” Currie said when asked
about the College’s role in Patterson
Court. :

“We are trying to do even more, to
bend over backwards to make sure we
weren't intentionally taking business
from houses,” he said in reference to the

relationship between the Commons and —

the houses.

“It's a chance for women to develop
skills which might help them later,” said
Jolly.

The Philanthropic Society is the only
campus organization to retain century-
old traditions, according to Monroe.
Each meeting opens and closes with
prayer and is run by formal parliamen-
tary procedure. Society members sing
the Alma Mater at the end of each meet-
ing. The Society emphasizes public
speaking skills.

The Phi Society last voted on the
issue of admitting women in October
1981. Monroe said that even though the
change did not pass, a majority short of
the two-thirds necessary voted for it.
