PROPHECY.

‘The thoughts and views of humanity
as a whole are gradually veering around
to that which is basicly practical and
just. Nowhere is this better shown
than in the evolution of the college. ‘The
antiquated college with its strict require-
ments of the classics and mathematics.
tho they developed the man, did not fit
him for the needs of the world. The
present day college is striving to suit
its products to their place in the world
and is shaping its curriculum accord-
ingly. New and practical subjects have
heen introduced. And the day is fot
far off when the graduate in mechanics
will be considered as highly educated as
the man that-can recite Homer.

This is an age of justice and practi-
cability. The aesthetic is minimized.
Man is coming to see that he has to
resort to the fundamental purpose and
causes in decisions and policies, as much
as he does to a common denominator
in adding fractions.

The day will come. we believe. when
a science with ‘several hours laboratory
will count moré on the college curricu-
lum than an easy subject without labor-
atoery work. In other words, some day
four hard “tickets” with several hours
af laboratory work, will go as far toward
a diploma as six or seven “crips.” Why?
Because it is fundamentally just that if
as much time and effort is spent on one
as the other. they should get the same
amount of credit for it. In like man-
ner. those graduating from Literary So-
cieties will need one subject less for a
college diploma than non-society  stu-
dents, for it is just that that work should
receive recognition. Also editors of
publications, inter-collegiate debaters, and
other officers in the student body will
receive credit for their work in their
collere curriculum, because they get
training in efficiency and responsibility
as well as mental development, and that
is the real purpose of a college educa-
tion. no matter what the process.

This is no plea that the students with
outside work should have their studies

lightened. It is a plea for justice against
those who take easy subjects and squeeze
by the passing grade, and yet get a

Y. M. C. A. HEARS
STIRRING ADDRESS

On the interesting and timely subjec
of “My Religion and My Country,”
the Rev. S. H. Hay, pastor of the Firs
Presbyterian church of Mooresville, ad
Iressed the Y. M. C. A. on Thursday
night. The speaker stated it as his be-
Nief that the United: States had been
-aised un for some distinct purpose in
‘he world, just as the Jewish race had
rroduced the Messiah. The purpose in
view for the United States. as it seem¢
now, was to proclaim religious, civil
and personal liberty to mankind and te
awaken, by her example, a spirit of na-
tional altruism in the nations of the
-vorld, as well as to give the Gospel of
Tecus Christ to those whom it is pos-
aible for her reach.

As illustrations of the working out
af this purpose, the establishment of this
-ountrv on principles of freedom, the
-xamoles that it has set for other nations
in their dealinys with each other, and its
work in spreading the Gospel among its
‘mmicrants, were all cited. In closing.
Mr. Hay expressed the hope that:in this
time of crisis, when the civilization of
the western hemisohere hangs practically
by a thread, that the people of the nation
would approach their duty to Gad and
country with thoughtfulness, confidence,
spiritual patriotism, and prayer, in  or-
der that we may do only what is right
and hest for the nation, whatever that
may be.
