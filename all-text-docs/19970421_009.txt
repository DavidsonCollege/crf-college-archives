_ THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, APRIL 21, 1997 9

I can’t believe it. The end of '

college looms close on the horizon,
and as strange or corny as it may
sound, I already know that I'll miss
it.

In the past five years, I’ve
learned quite a number of things,
and if you’ve got the time to read
thiscolumn, I’lldiscuss afew. Well,
I’ll talk about them anyway, but to
gain a little bit of wisdom from one
of the more vocal wise-asses around,
it’s up to you to read on.

I’ve learned is that having a

sense of humor is vital to a healthy —

existence, and you don’t have to
look very far to get a good laugh.
Hell, just look at the person right
nextto you, and if you’rein the right
frame of mind, that idiot will surely
put a smile right on your lips. If that
doesn’t work, take a look at the idiot
called yourself, and you’ll laugh
your ass off; that always works for
me.

I’ve learned something thatI’ ve
said before and that I'll say again:
Davidson is largely populated with
geeks, ex-geeks, and people who

sp nd four years learning social
skill8 alongside other people who
are learning social skills.

Testimonies to the immaturity —

and insecurity that many or most of
us carry around include ridiculous
arguments that go back and forth
for aeons in The Davidsonian, the
way obnoxious jerks drive forty

and if I want to stay true to myself
and to the Deity, who remains:a
mystery to all of us whether or not
we want to admit it, I have to let my
faith change and adapt with changes
in my life.

These days, I think that God
has a pretty good sense of humor,
but if I’d heard somebody say that
just a year ago, I would have dis-
agreed heartily. I really do think
that God is a pretty funny guy,
though, and let me give you an
example from the Christian faith, to
which I adhere half-assedly and ir-

crowd, there were more than a few
laughs.

I’ve learned that there are three
basic kinds of people at Davidson:
people who think that you can say
things like, “I’ve learned that there
are X-number basic kinds of
people,” people who say, “Youcan’t
divide people into neat little groups
like that,” and people who don’t
know if you can and don’t give a
damn. I’m proud to say that I’m
part of this third group.

I’ve learned that creativity and
scholarship are not enemies. Last

Well, I did it again, and I re-
ally didn’t mean to. For the second
time now, [have gotten the editors
to break the accepted journalistic
practice of not responding to an
opinion in the same edition in which
it is published. Although I was
pleased that they immediately vali-
dated the point of my article by
misusing their power, my article
was not meant to encourage any
more such abuses. I simply was

lenged my assertion that this was
not a limited occurrence and have
left me with no other option but to
cite examples of other misuses of
power. I don’t have the time to go
back through several years of ar-
chives to find examples like they
do, but I can.give a few off the top
of my head.

I’ve already alluded to the ten-
dency on the editors’ part to answer
articles in the same edition in which

have decided to “come out” this
weekend, and FLAG was able to
obtain leaders just in time to ask
the ATC for funds. Before anyone
misunderstands this one point, I
think FLAG has every right to get
funds and, although I do not agree
with its position on many issues, I
hold several of its past leaders and
members in high regard.

editors was given
a huge boost by a
“news” article
clearly designed to
accomplish that
goal. That was a

integrity” and questioned whether
there were any. The reason I con-
centrated on only the IVCF story
was because I did not feel anything
would be accomplished by drag-
ging up previous instances of mis-
use of power. I did not want this
debate to become personal and
emotional. I am sorry that it ap-
pears to have become that way. I
just wanted to point out what I saw
as the editors’ misuse of power. If
it was unintentional and they did
notrealize it was taking place, fine.
That is why I wrote the article
pointing it out.

However, the editors chal-

they are printed. Another might be
when earlier this year, one month’s
publication of crimes committed at
Davidson was omitted. What’s
wrong with that, you might ask?
Well, it may just be a coincidence,
but that was the month when an
editor committed one of those
crimes.

Or one could point to the ar-
ticle on the front page of last week’s
paper calling for the school to rally
behind FLAG because its member-
ship had declined somewhat and
there was achance that it would not
have any leaders next year.. The
Davidsonian succeeded in its goal,

clear misuse of power.

This is the end of the debate as
far as I am concerned. My last
article was not meant to start a
weekly exchange between myself
and the editors, and I will not con-
tinue it.

Maybe I’m an idealist (it
would not be the first time I have
been called that), but I think that if
a paper is claiming to report the
news, it should not bias that news
against groups the editors dislike
or in favor of groups they support.
I just want a fair college paper, and
I don’t think that is too much to
ask.

candoadozen things
at once if he or she only has enough
determination and drive. I can’t
give you an exact formula, but for
me it contained ingesting excessive
amounts of coffee, cigarettes, booze,
red meat, and fried foods, reading at
least one pleasure book a week,
taking everything with a grain of
salt, laughing whenever possible,
listening to Jimmy Buffett, CCR,
and Patsy Cline, talking too slow,
driving too fast, being high on life
and low on gas, sleeping four hours
anight, and eating four meals a day.

I’ve learned that there are a hell

of a lot of other creative and tal-
ented people here. Think about it; a
decently sized public university
contains about thirty thousand stu-
dents, which is roughly twenty times
the size of Davidson.

Let’ a-aly thutt dhece are twetity:
students here who are good artists,
twenty who are good athletes,
twenty who are good writers, and
twenty who are good musicians,
There are a lot more than that, but
I’m being conservative with my
numbers to make a point.

A big school would have to
have four hundred of each of these
to equal Davidson. If a school had
this many good artists, athletes,
writers, and musicians, it would be
a mecca of education, and people
would flock there and fight to getin.
Consider some writers that studied
here, like Patricia Cornwell, Will-
iam Styron, and Sheri Reynolds. A
big school would have to have sixty
alums who were so literarily in-
clined to equal this, and these are
only three of Davidson’s many grads
who have made a name for them-
selves writing.

I’ve learned that having friends
is more important than having
awards, accolades, or half a dozen
prestigious degrees. I’ve learned
how to laugh and enjoy life, and
these three lessons are the most
worthwhile things I’ve gotten out
of my education.
