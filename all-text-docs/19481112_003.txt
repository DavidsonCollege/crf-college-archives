Keithen, Jim Glenn, Murray Remson and Jim Thompson strode
in in that order before Bobby Long came up to make the best
race of the day.

Long was struekwith stomach cramps at the outset and
trailed all the way to the last 450-yards, But from there, hold-
ing aching side, he poured it on to catch W.&M.’s Riby and
pass him just 200 yards from the end for twelfth place.

Coach Norman Shepherd has released the 1949 Wildeat
basketball schedule. The schedule is virtuadly the same as last
year's in which the hoopsters racked up an impressive 19-9
record. In Southern Conference play, the Cats turned in a
10-7 record for fourth place behind States, Carolina, and
George Washington. This brought a conference bid which saw

Davidson advance to the semi-finals before bowing out to Duke.

The record is more impressive when we note that among
the vanquished were Duke and the University of South Caro-
lina which fell twiee. Washington and Lee and VME were
tawvo others which the Cats handled with ease.

The Charlotte Armory will be the scene of the major part
of’ the home contests. Maryland, Duke, South Carolina, State,
North Carolina, Clemson and Furmin will all journey to the
Queen City to do battle with the Red and Black.

Coach Shepherd will have almost the same material with
which to work as he did the previous year. Only losses among
the lettermen are DicRWills and Dave Poole. Mills entered the
University of Florida this year after finishing a steppedgup

at Davidson. It lanky lad Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, who sunk the deciding buckets in the
surprise defeat of Duke.

Poole ‘is still in school, but will be ineligible because he
signed a pro-baseball contract with the Cineinnati Reds.
Neither of these two were first stringers, but their loss will

program was this from

put a sizeable dent in the reserve corps.

All five of last year’s starters will return, led by All-Con-
ference center Buddy Cheek. Cheek, co-captain with the
smooth working Mike Williams, was second in conference
scoring honors to William and Mary’s Chet Ciermak. Buddy
looped -in- 370. points in-28-gaines-for-a neat-average of 13.2
per game. It will be the last year for one of Davidson’s all-
time greats, both on the basketball court and as a great end on
the gridiron.

Cheek’s greatness takes none of the brilliance from Slick
Mike Williams. Another senior, Williams will be finishing a
four-year tour of the courts in ‘the Davidson uniform. No
slouch on the score board, Mike rang the bell no less than
297 times though he missed not a few games because of a bun
ankle. Barring further injury this should be his greatest year.

Lefty Whit Cobb hooked in 296 markers to trail’ Williams
by a single point..The lanky junior from Durham is death on
set shots and hooks from the wrong side of the board. The
portsider has done well in upholding the All-State tag’ pinned
on him in North Carolina prep cireles. A. starter part of his
freshman year and one of the big three in his second, he has
given the scribes who named him no cause for regret.

Not far behind the leaders in last year’s point parade was
J. D. Ashmore with 233. However, Ashmore’s value can better
be measured by his aggressive game on the floor, Jake will
finish his ball handling career as a Wildeat.

Rounding out the starting five is senior Bobby Maner.
What he la¢ks in size, he makes up in speed and fight. Maner
battled his way to a starting berth last year from a Jayvee job.

Number one reserve spot goes to Bill Iverson who may
well be a starter by the end of the season. Iverson will be
starting his fourth year as a varsity man. Other reservites
back from last year include Cal Hopper, Henry Neisler, Bo
Roddey and Dutch Hengeveld, along with added strength
from last year's Jayvees.
