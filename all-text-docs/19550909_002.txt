Out of Confusion
A College Man

Are you bewildered? Do you find that
life around you moves in confusing
circles? Have the wrong room, can’t find
your counselor, lost your name tag, feel
tired ...... ? Relax, you must be a fresh-
man, and if so the following brief thoughts
are intended for you.

First of all the conditions in which you
find yourself are only normal for orienta-
tion. By nature of the varied motions of
this period and your newness to this
campus, confusion in varving degrees is
expected. Besides most of the counselors
were in the same boat at one time or
another—and some still are. Orientation
is not designed to discourage you or tax
your endurance. It should present a brief
glimpse of the life that is to be yours here
at Davidson, the grounds and plant sur-
rounding it, and the people involved in
its development. Relax and listen to what
is going on around you and all that is di:
rected towards you. Most of what is im-
parted comes from experience and is
spoken in your interest. There is much
to be gained from this period.

Rethink often why you have come to
college, the reasons and motives involved;
for the nature and strength of your pur-
poses determine to a great extent your
actions and their results.

The importance of a good start can-
not be .emphasized enough. Sincere and
earnest efforts in the battle of the books,
becoming acquainted with members of the
student body, and following the rules and
regulations, go a long way toward estab-
lishing your mark as a college student.
Your best is expected by your college and
family as well as yourself.

Take full advantage of the opportuni-
ties afforded you here.
acquired a successful budget of time, you
will have ample opportunity to engage
in the many activities, college features,
and worthwhile programs which are of-
fered. Make your college life well rounded
and culturally deep.

One does not become a college man
by donning a freshman hat and tag, by
dating every night, or by joining a frater-
nity. It becomes a four-year process, one
whose growth and stature is determined
by the individual’s interest and desire.
To be or not to be a college man—that
is your question.

As indicated during’ your orientation
program thus far, you are not only be-
coming a student at Davidson of math,
liberal arts or the sciences—you are be-
coming a student of life. Study according:
ly.

Upon looking back you will be amazed
at how fast you have become a part of
college life. You will realize that it is an
honor and a challenge to receive and con-
tinue the opportunities of the present,
spirit of the past, and expectations of the
future of this your college.

What’s in a Name?

What’s in a name? Whether it is in
artistic propaganda for nationally known
gasoline, in a moniker for a TV produc-
tion, or the common tag by which your
neighbor is known, there is something
very important in a name.

An administrative official said the
other day when name plates were issued:
“I don’t care what you say about me, as
long as you spell my name correctly.”
Another gentleman at Fort, Benning
ROTC camp was prepared to fight in de-
fense of his name which had been in-
tentionally mispronounced.

Here at Davidson the importance of a
man’s name often becomes lost in the

After you have’

official recognition of everyone by a broad
smile and a friendly “Hey, Uh” or “Hey,
Uh-Uh,” if he is more familiar to you. It
becomes an order to speak. If you don’t
you become a number of the Court of
Control roster. banned by local organiza-
tions, and carefully scrutinized by the
social police.

Don’t be satisfied. however, with a
passing or obligatory greeting. One of the
greatest compliments that you can pay
a man on beginning acquaintance is to
call him by name. For the quicker you
learn a name. the quicker you attach
characteristics and qualities—in a word—
personality to it: the sooner you know
the student body, the faster you become in
spirit and in truth a Davidson gentle-
man. To call everyone by name, to know
the members of the student body, is not a
time-worn tradition: it is a privileged
heritage.

Mazgill’s Resignation
Brings New Challenge

The staff of your Davidsonian notes
with ‘regret the recent resignation of
Sam Magill as YMCA _ Secretary. His con-
tribution to the life of our campus and
the contmunity has been great, and the
boys with whom he has worked and coun-
seled are lasting evidence of his concern
for the highest principles, and actions of
life. His new position is indeed a fine op-
portunity and challenge. Our loss will be
their gain.

The YMCA Board of Directors has
sought diltigently through interviews
and conferences to replace Mr. Magill for
the remainder of this year. Their selection
will have a large responsibility in guiding
a new and voluntary YMCA program.

‘This fact should give added incentive
to your consideration of “Y” membership.
The opportunities for service in a volun-
tary religious organization of this nature
are great and varied. Your efforts and
interest can indeed build the new “Y”
and soundly fullfill the purpose.

Your Newspaper

A word about the Davidsonian. Con-
trary Lo the rumors yow may have heard,
it is the official student news organ, a
weekly newspaper usually containing four
pages. which appears in student rooms on
Friday evenings. (It may be found any-
where on Saturday mornings, however.)
it is your paper. Its plans are built around
your interests. Contribute to its progress
with your writings, suggestions, com-
ments, and interest. The Davidsonian of-
fice in the College Union will be open
for your convenience on Monday after-
noon and Wednesday afternoon and eve-
ning.—R.H.M.

Rush Week

Just a word about Rush Week and
the rushing regulations that you have
probably already seen in the Wildeat
Handbook. Rush Week is a pretty im-
portant time in the life of the Davidson
student and a familiarity with the rushing
rules is necessary. if we are to have a suc-
eessful start. Therefore, get them out and
read them over at once again.

Feel free to discuss with your coun-
selor any questions. that you think need
to be clarified. On Monday, Phil Koonce,
president of the Interfraternity Council,
will talk to you in chapel and explain
further the intricacies of the next two
weeks.

One further word might be said about
Rush Week, and that is to be yourself
and to act naturally. It’s a great oppor-
tunity to get to meet practically the whole
student body personally, so make the
most of it.— Don Stewart, Treasurer of
the LF.C.

‘Y’ Program Depends
On Student Reaction

By BLAKE BRINKERHOFF

Those of you who are freshmen
are witnessing the start of a
YMCA program which in many
ways is completely unlike the one
which has functioned in the past.
Some of the major changes are as
follows:

(1) The Y is voluntary now.
This means that students have the
opportunity to examine the pro-
gram carefully and see for them-
selves whether or not such an or-
ganization is worthy of. their time
and. contributions.

(2) Much of the cabinet struc-
ture has been changed. This re-
sults from some careful evaluation
on the effectiveness of some of
the posts that have characterized
the old system—those serving the
purpose being kept and others dis-
carded.

(3) A theme for the year has
been selected. This theme unites
our fellowships as a group of stu-
dents and faculty members who
through participation in the work
carried on by the posts and in-
terest in the total program, are
seeking to live according to the
teachings of Jesus. Our theme it-
self is “Living Daily for Christ.”

Now that we have noticed how
the “Y" has changed, we ought
to examine some of the character-
istics of the fellowship. The “Y"”
is not just for pre-ministerials or
others who have chosen to enter
some phase of [full-time Christian
work, but is open to everyone.
Skeptics who. are searching for
answers to their problems, mem-
bers of various religious faiths,
and others, are welcome as the
persoh who is looking for oppor-
tunities to express his firm con-
victions. Pre-meds, pre-laws, and
pre-not-sures are invited and en-
couraged to become members.

I hope I am not misunderstood.
The most important part of the
YMCA is its Christian purpose
which will not be compromised
with anything else. But the “Y" is
an inclusive and not an exclusive
organization.

When you received your Wild-
cat Handbook you probably no-

TIDBITS OF

One cannot remain on campus
long before he is accosted and
sometimes overwhelmed by tradi-
tion. The following are some
habits of tradition not often
known to the average passerby,
but which lend insight into the
“Spirit” of Davidson.

Davidson College lost 83 men in
the Civil War, 21 in World War
I, and 159 in World War Il. The
percentage of alumni was highest
for the Civil War.

John K. Winkler’s biography of
Woodrow Wilson remarks on p. 37:
“His father selected a dull, rigor-
ous old Presbyterian institution
called Davidson College ... Young
Wilson fell in with the regimen
perfectly but his stomach couldn’t
stand the fare. Nervous indiges-
tion gripped him and, in the spring
of 1874, he returned home.”

Davidson College had a Ku Klux
Kian immediately following the
War Between the States. It was
organized by members of the
faculty and composed of students
of the College and clerks in the
local stores. The occasion for the
Klan, according to the official his-
tory of the college, was insult of-
fered by a darkey to one of the
professor’s daughters.

Hinton Rowan Helper, who wrote
the most famous anti-slavery book
next to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, was a
brother of Hanson Pinkney Helper
who operated the old inn across
from Eu Hall before the Civil War.

ticed the many service opportu-
nities available in the YMCA.
Boys’ Work, Scouting, Community
Work, and Deputations to
Churches and Schools all afford
the chance to serve God through
serving others. Through Hail Pray-
er meetings, the College Bible
Class, and the various Commis-
sions, you. have the chance to think
through the faith you have, for
everyone deep down inside ha
faith in something. .

- Through the Gift Fund you have
a chance to give to others who
are not as fortunate as you are,
and through the social functions
planned, you can see that having
a good time in the best spirit is an
important part of Christian living.

At this point your attitude may
be that your main purpose in col
lege is just to have a good time,
just to study, or to get away from
doing anything connected with
“religion” except what is compul-
sory at Davidson. This type of at-
titude reflects an immature con-
ception of the purpose of life when
practiced.

I am reminded of two statements
which I heard this summer. They
really made me think. First of all,
it was said that “although many
college students have the historical
and mathematical knowledge of
mature people, their religious con-
ception are on a 12-year-old level.”
The other statement was that “Each
day is equi-distant from God.” If
we accept these statements as
truth, and certainly they are
worthy of serious thought, then
college life can be viewed in a
new and challenging perspective.

‘The success of the “Y” program
will not be seen in numbers or
Statistics of any kind. It will be
measured by the intangibles of
deepened convictions, enthusiastic
participation, .and a_ spirit of
brotherly love. We hope that you
will examine the program of the
“Y,” ask any questions you may
have about it and take an active
part in the work that it seeks
to do at Davidson.

TRADITION

The chandlier in Phi Hall is a re-
plica of the one under which Na-
poleon the Third and the Empress
Eugenie were married. It was made
in France about 1850 and bought
by the Phi's in 1853.

It is an established fact that
Woodrow Wilson planted a tree
while a student at Davidson (Every-
body did.) But where it is (or. was)
nobody knows.

Davidson had the first separate
YMCA building on a Southern col-
lege campus. This was the “old
gym” which stood between Cham-
bers and Watts and was pulled
down several years ago.

There have been two student
walk-outs in the history of David-
son, in 1855 a student was ex-
pelled (it was believed for rock-
ing a member of the faculty) and
the student body was reduced
from 75 to 31. In 1903 the Fresh-
men walked to Cornelius to catch
the train home because the Sophs
broke their pledge about hazing
(or so the Frosh contended). They
were persuaded to come back.

The Phi Beta Kappa chapter at
Davidson was the second in the
South established in a liberal arts
college.

.... underlying all a Davidson
student is a gentleman in every
sense of the word. He is courteous,
truthful, reverent, and above all
honorable.”

QUEENS

AND ALL SUCH THINGS

Gentlemen, you inherit a great
tradition. For over a century there
have been Davidson men and
Queens women, and the record over
the hundred of years of their
various and nefarious relations is,
on the whole, a pretty sordid one.
The late president of Queens once
described the highway between Da-
vidson and Charlotte as “that road
paved with Davidson hopes and
Queens resolutions.” Now this dis-
tinguished man had quite a sense
of humor: he once tried to quell
a Davidson riot that had caravaned
its operations to the Queens cam-
pus by offering them cokes. But
in this he kidded us not. By the
way, we don’t have riots anymore.
They disappeared from the David-
son scene at about the same time
as the ROTC unit withdrew from
the College.

It will take a little background
for you to grasp the unique sig-
nificance of Queens in the life of
a Davidson man. Way back in the
dim beginnings of the Western
World it is recorded that the Lord
made man, and then he made
woman because it was not good for
man to be alone. This rather handy
concept survived for some 50,000
years, and may have served to
keep the race going. But with a
characteristically liberal and pio-
neering spirit that cares nothing
for the past and outmoded tradi-
tion, Davidson reversed all this. It
is good for man to be alone. The
world of Greek verbs and Pavlo-

By JASON MceMANUS

vian dogs and the world of hair-
pins and smeared Kleenex do not
meet—between them there is a
fixed great gulf across which no
man may pass if he belong to
Davidson. Or at least this was the
case until one bleak and dismal,
monohormonic year, like all the
years before it since 1837, a stu-
dent whose name we do not know
but whose title is Genius made a
discovery that was our salvation:
the weekend. For years people
simply knew when the week began
because on that day they went to
church. For the students, it was
the day you didn’t study. That was
all. It never had occurred to any-
one that you might make a posi-
tive use of it, or that it might af-
fect your acitvities on the pre-
ceding day. But finally it did occur
to one man, and I wish we knew
more about that historic Saturday
night. Some historians have hinted
he was just lazy, and didn't feel
like. studying that night. Some
others have suggested he owed her
father some money, or needed to
borrow a book from him. But I
like to think it was premeditated,
a burst of that primeval creative
energy that motivates men at every
crucial point in history, and that if
he could tell us about it now he
would say with Luther as he went
to Cornelius to call on Miss
Daphne on a _ borrowed horse:
“Here I go—I can do not other-
wise, so help me.”

The skeptic may scoff at that as

a cry of mere desperation, but the
fact remains that the Unknown
Horseman was the first who ever
did anything about the disease,
and from him has evolved our fer-
tile social life as we know it today
at Davidson. Thus, when you turn
to page 86 in your Wildcat hand-
book, you will find a map. On this
map are the directions and dis-
tances by thumb to significant
centers of that other world. Be-
cause the weekend is now an ac-
cepted concept, a hypothesis that
has proved itself, you may visit,
and no doubt will, a good many
of these exotic oasis.

And what is the significance of
Queens in all this. Simply, as a
quick glance at the map will tell
you, Queens: is the closest of all,
the nearest pasture. Subsequently
in the never-ceasing, relentless
quest for The Girl you may find
others greener in your four years,
but the first pasture for the David-
son man is traditionally Queens.
Girls come to Queens to date Da-
vidson men--this is a recommenda-
tion for them in itself. So make
the most of the Queens-Davidson
Freshman Dance, for after this
week the upper-class competition
moves in, and it is a hungry lea-
gue. Man still doesen’t like to live
alone. If you do not know this now
after three days here you will
know hereafter. Some blonde ia-
surance is quite in the order of

business. To arms!

Davidson Students Begin Year
Under Revised Constitution

This fall marks the beginning of
the forty-fifth year that Davidson
students have governed themselves
from a_ written constitution.
Throughout this period of self-gov-
ernment never once has the faculty
reversed a decision of the Student
Council. In order that we of the
Davidson Student Body of 1955-56
may maintain this heritage of self-
government and strengthen jt for
those who will follow, I would like
to briefly make a few requests of
each student.

My .first request is that each of
you thoroughly familiarize your-
self with the Student Government
Constitution. Last Spring saw the
Student Body vote in a revised
Constitution, and this year marks
the first full school term under
this revised document. With self-
government goes a strong obliga-
tion; and this obligation can only
be fulfilled by having a complete
knowledge of the provisions of the
constitution and determining to
follow these provisions. Not only
for that reason, but to insure that

By PERRIN ANDERSON

no one will suffer because of lack
of knowledge, I urge each of you
to know what is expected of you,
and to have no question concern-
ing the laws which we the students
have set up for ourselves. I refer
each of you to pages 48-62 of the
Wildeat Handbook where you will
find the complete Constitution.
Take off a few minutes and read
these pages.

My second request is twofold.
First, find out who the Student
Council members are, and second,
go see them when you have a
problem, a gripe, or something you
would like to see done. On page
47 of the Wildcat Handbook you
will find listed the 15 members of
the Student Council. These boys
were elected by the Student Body
for one reason, that reason being
to serve the students.

The Student Government office
located on the second floor of the
College Union will be open at
regular scheduled hours, to be an-
nounced later. You are invited and

urged to come in. During the first
few days of school we will try to
keep the office open as much as
possible. If you are unable to find
anyone there, get in touch with
a Student Council member, or
come by my room, 151 Belk.

It is the sincere hope of the
tudent Council that the Council

IH! play a primary role in the
tudent life during the coming
ear. We hope that you, the stu-
ents, will use us to voice your
dpinions and to work for the type
of school you desire.

In conclusion, always keep in
mind that the Constitution is the
creation of the students, not the
faculty. Likewise the maintenance
of these rules is a student re-
sponsibility, again not a faculty
job, The students can change this
body of laws at any time, but until
then we must abide by them. The
sole reason for Student Government
at Davidson is to enable students
to run their own affairs and to
govern themselves.

PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT
NEEDED BY ALL FRESHMEN

Chapel Hill, N.C. (.P.)}—As an
individual experiencing university
life for the first time, the entering
freshman encounters a significant
adjustment period, according to
report of the special committee on
fraternity rushing at the University
of North Carolina. For many it is
the first extended absence from
home, the committee points out.
Others, developing proper study,
habits and learning to accept addi-
dional responsibilities is a serious
problem. The full report on
Rushee's Problems follows:

While the length of the adjust-
ment period varies with the back
ground and the maturity of the in-
dividual, a minimum adjustment is
reauiree of all students. In the
sense that the first few weeks on
campus are important in establish-
ing the tone of an individual’s
work, it was felt that as little out-
side pressure should be permitted
as possible.

The observation was made that
the grades of the average freshman
in a fraternity were comparatively
lower than the average non-frater-
nity freshman. This was attributed
to some extent to a time-consum-
ing rush schedule which occurred
at a time when many freshmen
were not adjusted. It was pointed
out that, in addition, this period
was frequently the period when
first quizzes were given.

The committees agreed that fra-
ternities also required some time
at the beginning of each academic
year to prepare themselves both for
their academic work and the re-

lated activities of the fraternity.
The first few weeks of school did
not seem to be adequate, consider-
ing the additional study require-
ments and the myriad activities of
the fall.

The suggestion was made that
individuals interested in fraterni-
ties would not have an opportunity
to appraise them without a longer
waiting period. At the same time,
fraternity members could not
evaluate the prospective rushees
properly. For these and other
reasons, it was felt that a rush
period at the end of the first
semester might be desirable. There
were a number of significant
points, however, which were
brought out in support of an early
rushing program.

Financially, fraternities are faced
with a serious problem if a system
of delayed rushing is initiated. Fig-
ures presented to the committee
by the Student Activities Fund Of.
fice showed that at the present
time fraternities would lose on an
average between $50 and $100 per
week operating at less than maxi-
Mum capacity. It was explained
that this situation was created by
the fact that fewer boys were
using the facilities.

Records showed that as pledge
classes joined the fraternities, they
were able to absorb the costs of

these operating losses so that by

the end of the year most of the
fraternities were able to break even
or show a small profit. If pledging
were delayed, the costs of joining
a fraternity would be raised con-

siderably and would keep some
students who were now able to
participate in fraternity activities
from joining. A delay in joining
a fraternity and the resultant strict
silence periods would cause undue
pressure on freshmen and they
would frequently be unable to meet
socially with friends that they had
known prior to coming to the Uni-
versity.

T gladly extend to you a cordial
welcome to Davidson. We admit
you to a fellowship which is real

sentials to a successful college ca-
reer at Davidson are Honor, Friend-
liness, Will Power, and Hard Work.

Anytime during this year, or the
years which follow, when I can be
of,any assistance to you in any way,
I sincerely hope you will let me
know. I want to know each of you.
You will be welcome in my office
and in my home.
