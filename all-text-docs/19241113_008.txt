It pays to advertise. This is the adopted
motto of the Davidsonian Press Bureau,
an organization which has this year forg-
ed to the forfront among the active as-
sets of the college. The bureau, organiz-

ed approximately two years ago, is today |

handling all the news that goes into the
daily newspapers from Davidson College;
and judging. from the figures and tabu-
lations kept by the association, its task
is no small one.

An average of over three stories a day
have sent to the newspapers of
North Carolina and the neighboring
states by the bureau within the past 60
the total number of words
wired, mailed and phoned into the news-
papers by the bureau in the past two
months exceeds 80,000,

The bureau at the time of its estab-
lishment in 1918 was a branch of the
Davidsonian, but two years ago by
special ruling of the-faculty the work of
the press bureau was placed in the hands
of two students as assistants, with the
general secretary of the “Y” supervising

handled in its entirety by Mr. J. P. Wil-
jliams, secretary of the “Y.” He found

ithe work required too much of his time,
however, and this year two students
were drafted by the bureau. Milton and
Wharton have handled the work of the
press bureau this fall, and they have
been more than successful in their ef-
forts. Their articles, mainly
stories have been handled by practically
every large newspaper in the southeast,
and the college has greatly benefited
thereby.

Friday, December 12, will see the
orators, of the Senior class in all their
glory. This is the date set for the pre-
liminary tryouts to select four members
of the class to take part in the final
sppeaking in June during commencement.

This is an annual event in the life of

by the class of '25 indicates that it will
be better this year than ever before.

been with great rejoicing that they read of

faculty to offer a medal for the winner,

medal would be offered. However, there

| Seniors have expressed a desire to take
part.

The date is set for this fall on account

| would have a tendency to occupy the
}minds of the Seniors, and would hinder

lof the Senior class who will probably
| take part are J. R. Earnest, A. N. Moffett,
