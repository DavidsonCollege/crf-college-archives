Varsity Men to be Chosen by
Elimination Tournament

The fall tournament, to decide which
players shall compose the 1926 golf team,
is now well under way. . The final match
of the first flight will be played Saturday,
if the’ weather is favorable. As the “best
players have been placed in this flight,
the result of this match will probably de-
termine the team. Of the berths,
Steve McGill, the only’ returning veteran,
will occupy one, while the other five will
probably be contested between. “Billy
