An Opportunity

Tt is to be-hoped that the leaders of all
social fraternities will take notice of and
comply with the Pan Hellenie Council's Te-
cent suggestion that all fraternities elect
their Pan Hel representatives for the 1948-49
term as soon as possible. This request stems
from an’earnest desire to acquaint these
men with the problems facing the present
council in order to better equip them to
properly perform their duties next year, and
more important, to give them. an opportunity
to participate in the discussions which will
be devoted to the subject of proposed
changes in the rushing regulations now ir
effect. As we all remember. the adoption of
a radically different set of rules governing
this campus activity at the last moment in
May, 1947, caused much confusion, bitter:
ness, and ill feelings, By beginning a study
of the existing situation now it will be possi-
ble to make a painstaking examination, aad
to reach a decision satisfactory to all.

This editorial is not to be construed as a
demand for change in or for a discarding of
the present regulations. The subject is far
too complex for one person to understand
thoroughly (without help from others also
seeking 4 solution) nor can one man unaided
hope to arrive at. the’ proper answer. How-
ever, all of us recognize the fact that we
must remove the bitterness resulting from a
misunderstanding of the existing scheme be-
fore another ‘‘Rush Week’’ is‘upoh us. The
Pan Hellenic Council is to be commended for
making an honest effort to do just that
They deserve in this undertaking the
wholehearted support of each and every
social fraternity on the campus. Ont of this
cooperation and mutual trust will emerge
true harmony. é

A Challenge

As a result of the extreme damage to
college and other property within the cor-
porate limits of Davidson by student snow-
ballers several’ weeks ago the Executive
Committee has decided to act to prevent the
recurrence of such events. The committee,
however, -has clearly indicated that it pre-
fers not to have to deal with any future of-
fenders but would like instead for the stu-
dent council to dispose of all cases of this
nature.

At the present time there is no provision

in the constitution giving the representatives |
of the student body the authority to do this.
Therefore, an will have to be
drawn up and passed by the student body
before the couneil ean act, If this is not done
continue to

amendment

the Executive Committee will
have jurisdiction in such matters, and will
punish all who destroy property, by snow-
balls on the merits of the individual’s case.

Altho no one can honestly question the
fairness of the justice meted out by this or
any other faculty committee, it seems that
this is-a-problem which should be and can
be solved by the student body, No one has
suggested for a moment that snowballing on
the campus should be ‘foutlawed.’? Most all
faculty members fully realize that it is the
ndtural thing to do, and that it is quite
harmless under normal conditions. Towever,
it becomes a different matter when carried
on in’a manner and in areas where it will
result in damage to the person and/or prop-
erty of others, Practices~of this nature are
what they seek to stop.

We may at a glance regard this as an
unwarranted interference with Our rights,
but only a moment’s reflection will be suf-
ficient to cause us to realizesthat it is rather
an infringement by us on the rights of
others instead. It is a violation of their right
to protection the thoughtless and
malicious acts of their fellow citizens, aiid
we should not take part in activities which
deprive them of that right.

In this case, however, we can, to use an

from

old but apt expression, ‘have our cake and
eat it, too.’? We can support the amendment
viving the Student Couneil authority to deal
with those who insist on disregarding the
rights of others in this manner—we can per-
sonally refrain from participating in such
affairs and seek to exercise a restraining in-
fluence on those around us—and still get as
much enjoyment out of snowballing—as a
sport—as ever before. As has been indicated
already, the faculty has no objection to
snowballing as such—in faet it is encouraged
as long as there is no danger that property
that non-participants
may be injured. Many other colleges have
organized snowball battles on the athletic
fields between fraternities and classes and
there is no reason why it: cannot be done
here.

Admittedly, cold weather and snow may
at. the but this

may be damaged or

seem far away moment,

_ problem should be solved before the year is

over, and new matters crowd if out of our

minds.

Letters to the
Editor...

Dear Editor:

During the year a number of letters and
editorials have been written concerning our
chapel conduct. These exhortations to better
conduet have used many approaches in their
efforts to reach the student body—all ap-
parently unsuccessful. Though IT have not
been the least among the offenders, [ should

like to voice my opinion.

I am sure we can all see the gravity and
importance of this situation when we com-
pare the viewpoints of visitors toSour cam-
pus.. Those the
privilege of speaking to us as a group, use
only the kindest .antl most latidatory, of
adjectives in their remarks on Davidson.
Those who do appear before us use adjectives

who do notthave dubious ~

of quite a different complexion.

A certain lady who sang here not so long
ago had ‘this to say, ‘‘I have never been
treated in such a rude and unkind manner.
Their discourtesy to me ranged from. ill-
concealed magazine reading to yawning,
sleeping, and other signs of boredom,’? She:
has told several influential people this and
their opinions of Davidson have altered in
an unfortunate direction, The lady who said
these things is only one of a number of peo-
pleinsulted-by usavho-is-telling others of-our
shameful behavior,

The importance of this ‘cannot be waved
lightly away. The opinions of those who
appear before us and are treated to a dose of
the ‘good old Davidson Spirit’? are doing
us irreparable harm, :

All those present .at a recent chapel ex-
ercise conducted by:a prominent member of
the student body must surely be ashamed,
on reflection, of our behavior to lim, His
falk, which had a good point, was openly
laughed at and commented upon, not, I am
sure, through any intentional rudeness, but -
only through thoughtlessness on our part.

“Knowledge does not comprise
all which is contained in the large
term of education, The feelings are
to be disciplined; the passions are
to be restrained; true and worthy
motives are to be inspired; a pro-
found religious feeling is to be in-
stilled, and pure morality inculcated
under all circumstances. All this is
comprised in education.”

We find that great thinkers in
the years since Webster have
neither considered an educated man
one who has at his command a
supply of ‘facts.’? More recently
Nicholas Murray Butler has added;

“There are five tests of the evi-
education—correctness

dards of appreciation of beauty and

STUDENT ELECTIONS

In order that we, the voters, may
know the candidates, their qualifi-
cations, records and ideas, we be-
lieve an amendment to the student
government constitution should be
drawn up and presented to the stu-
body “as soon as_ possible,
which would include the following
changes in the system of elections.

form length for each of the can-

2. A special election issue of

ing pictures, qualifications,
records, and ideas for school
improvement (if any) of each
candidate.

This amendment is proposed be-
cause, of the simple fact that a
majority of us who were here dur-
ing last elections did not
know but a few of the many men
who-were -running—-and-—therefore
were faced with the choice of either
voting blindly or not participating
in the elections. Neither choice is
inducive to good citizenship. We
will be foolish to count on the same
good luck in blindly selecting men
for office that was ours last time.
