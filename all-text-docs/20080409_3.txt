SGA announces Academic Policy Committees

External Affairs Committee.

Duncan Bowling

SGA
‘External Affairs
‘Committee has two
imain goals: linking
{the student body to
* tthe town of
Davidson and link-
jing the student body
o the SGA itself.

The College and
the town of Davidson have always been
closely related in that what affects one usual-
ly affects the other.

Thus, the External Affairs Committee
aims to create and maintain dialogue
between town leaders and Davidson stu-
dents.

The SGA can be a mysterious organization
at times; many students are not sure of what
it does or how it functions. By using several
modes of communication, the External
Affairs Committee aims to bring transparen-
cy and clarity to the SGA in the eyes of thé
student body.

Please contact dubowling for more infor-
mation on the External Affairs Committee.

~Committee works
_with students, facul-
y and trustees to
mprove students'
educational experi-
ence at Davidson.
his past year the
APC organized a
forum series with various topics related to
Davidson academics in which students, fac-
ulty and’ trustees were all invited to attend.
Student representatives on the committee
then relayed the resulting discussion to fac-
ulty, trustee committees and the SGA.

The APC also created a Blackboard dis-
cussion link for students to post concerns as
well as an academic survey administered a
few weeks ago.

Although the agenda has not yet been
completely set, we plan to continue the
forum series, follow up the survey and draft
a possible mid-course evaluation next year.
