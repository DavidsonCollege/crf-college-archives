By KNOX ABERNETHY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The faculty unanimously accepted an Honor Court

statement of policy

concerning pledged work presented

by Scott Lacy, chairman of the Honor Court and Harrison

Wellford, a member of the
meeting Tuesday afternoon.
the Judicial Committee for
next faculty meeting.

The resolution presented to
the faculty the problems of “div.
ing,” “spotting,” and disclosing
the test to students of other sec-
tions.

FACULTY CONCERNED

Faculty members generally ex-
pressed concern for the pro-
blem, but were pleased by the
court's action.

Professor R. R. Bernard, head
of the Mathematics Department,
stated that he was delighted that

The report was referred to
study and discussion at the

the faculty had seen the pro-
blem “since it is undoubtedly
partly our fault.”

The report from the Honor
Court to the faculty was origin-
ally drawn up by Wellford with
Lacy’s assistance and was re-
cently approved by ODK and
the Honor Court. It is part of
the court’s present effort to
promote a better spirit of honor
at Davidson, an issue which was
primarily aroused by the Stu-
dent Council’s recommendation
that the court start work with
the faculty in defining more
clearly the meaning of pledged
work and the offenses which the
honor system covers.

CLARIFIES STAND

“In light of practices current-
ly in evidence among the stu-
dent body,” the report states,
“the Honor Court, feeling. that
these practices are encroach-
ments on the Honor System,
would like to clarify its inter-
pretation of the section of the
Student Body Constitution relat-
ing to them.”

the pledge defined in Art. 9,
Sec. 6 of the Constitution, the
Honor Court “wishes to make
clear that the following prac-

System:

(1) the taking of a test from a
classrom after the professor has
specifically stipulalcd that the
test is not to leave the class

(2) the disclosure of a test
given in one class section to stu-

Council Designates

New Fresh

man Court

The Student Council met last Monday night to elect
the members of the new Freshman Court, as well as settle

some other issues.

Elected to the court were ris-
ing seniors D. G. Martin, R.
Henry Moore, and James Davis;
rising juniors Larry Leafer and
Danny Carrell; and r:sing sopho-
mores Wiley Horne and Howard
Arbuckle. These men will serve
under the recently elected
Freshman Advisor, Bob Stone.

The council suggested that
the new Freshman Regula-
tions, which had recently been
drawn up, be made a by-lew,
and therefore not subject to
change by future councils
with a simple majority; but
this motion failed to pass.
These regulations are basical-
ly the same as those of years
past. However, the “walking
on grass” clause has been
omitted, and a rule providing
for nameplates on doors in
the dorms added.

“We think now that there is a
reasonable purpose for all the
regulations,” president Henry
Shue said. He indicated that, in
correlation with the spirit of
the new court, all regulations
could be thought of as being in
the good interests of the fresh-
men, and the omission of chapel

proceedings would eliminate
any attempts at embarrassmént.
He further said, ‘‘The success of
the new system will depend on
the personalities of the men on
the court.”

The inauguration of the new
council will take place in chapel
on Monday. Hutton Barron and
Jack Taylor were elected as the
two seniors to remain on the
council with Shue for the rest
of the year.

Ken Kelly, the new First
Vice-president, was selected to
serve as acting President of
the Student Council for the
rest of this semester due to
the absence of George Trask.
It was suggested that a by-

law be passed providing that
ail motions in the future be
tabled for a week before voting.
This would serve to eliminate
hasty decisions on the part of
the council, and also would pro-
vide the student body an ‘oppor-
tunity to discuss the new legis-
lature with the council mem-
bers. This did not come to a
vote, since the council decided it
was better to wait until next
year on this issue.

ROTC Load

The freshman ROTC requirement will be reduced to one hour of classroom study
and a one-hour drill period next year. Sophomore’ requirements will remain at two

classroom hours.

In a meeting last Tuesday the
faculty decided to reduce the
freshman requirement to one
classroom hour with the stipula-
tion that an additional hour of
some other academic subject ap-
proved by the ROTC Department
be substituted. This course need
not be taken during the fresh-
man year but may be putoff un-
til a later time.

Freshmen will now attend
ROTC one day a week each se-
mester. This will give them a
total of two hours credit for the
entire year. They will also be at-

Extra $75
Deposit
Due July 1

All students returning to Da-
vidson next year must pay an
extra $75 tuition deposit by July
1, M. W. McGill, college bursar,
announced to THE DAVIDSON:
IAN today. This fee is in addi-
tion to the $25 deposit paid last
month.

“This system of payment is
designed to help assure the at-

§‘tendance of those students who

have indicated they will attend
Davidson, and the payment will
not be refunded in the event the
student withdraws between July
1 and the opening of college,”
McGill explained.

The college has been requir-
ing a $100 deposit from appli-
eants accepted for the next
year’s freshmen class, but has
previously required only $25
from present students. McGill
stressed this is not an addition.
al cost as students will pay $100
less when registering in Septem-
ber.

McGill also announced an in-
crease in the cafeteria board fee
from $375 to $400 per year. “The
present rate has been in effect
for more than three years dur-
ing which time the cost of food,
labor and other expenses has
risen sharply,” he said.

McGill indicated the increased
tuition deposit is largely be-
eause of the rooming situation.
The $25 fee no longer assures a
definite enough knowledge of
the number of students return-
ing, with the result that student
openings are not filled.

Easy-Going Millner
Ran Paper His Way

By DON SAUNDERS
Davidsonian Associate Editor

; In his last DAVIDSONIAN as Editor, B. Millner, after taking a final shot at the
John Aitken Sneden, Jr. new! Trystees in an editorial, pictured himself in a cartoon as a pair of crossed eyes, ready
to seek refuge at the Happy Hills Rest Home. “I guess that’s the last. of those damn
liberals,” someone is saying as B. and his staff are locked up.

Maybe his words sound differ-
ent in print, but actually B.
Millner's an easy-going, quiet
sort of guy. For example, over
the spring holidays, while Fiori-
da beaches were crowded with
the country’s collegians, B. and
a couple of others took off for
a few quiet days of fishing in
the Okefenokee.

Most of B.'s staff remen-
bers, not the flaming words he
used against the Trustees, the
tFC, or Sophomore Rush. They
remember more run-of-the
mill things. “Godwin, your
pege was full of typographical
errors this week — 1! liked
your layout.” “Saunders, your
back page looked pretty good,
but put the Student Council
story on the front page next
time.” “Jordan, you didn’t
get all the extra adjectives out
of Herb’s blurb about the
Artists Series.”

From first page to last,
though, this was always B.'s pa-
per. He not only wrote editor-
ials; he usually did the cartoon,
at least one news story, often
wound up taking most of the
pictures, helped with layout on
all four pages, wrote heads, and
even took over as proofreader.

Ask him sometime why at
midnight every Wednesday he'd
drive to a dark farmhouse out-
side of Cornelius so THE,DA-
VIDSONIAN could run pictures
in its pages.

Or ask him about the wild

rides to Charlotte or Moores-

ville, to pick up the photogra-
phic cuts while the press here
in town was waiting to roll.

Yet with all these goings-on,
B. squeezed in some study time
on his major, and found time to
court (and get engaged to) one
of the cutest school teachers any
high school student ever saw.

Next year B. goes into the
bigtime — though in a small

p

way. He'll start work for The
Charlotte Observer this summer
as a general staff writer and re-
porter. After this summer, per-
haps the Army will get him.

The new staff, with four or
five men now filling B.'s many
positions, will remember his de-

votion to the paper. And, as all
of us have said more than once,
“B.'s way was the best.”
