The annual class day exersices are to}

take place at 5:30 o'clock, Monday af-
ternoon, on the campus just east of the
“well.” This is to follow the lawn party
at which the members of the class are to
be guests of Miss Goudyloch Erwin, the
class mascot. Several features will
mark the exercises as the program of
the commencement period distinctively
conducted by the Senior class.

The presentation of the class gift will
be made formally at this time. The gift
of the class of 1925 is, the new brick and
concrete base and covering for the cam-
pus “well.” The marble fountain on the
inside was the gift of the class of 10916,
and this is being supplemented by the
new structure of the covering. The ar-
chitectural scheme was designed with a
view to matching the new Chambers.

Three speeches will feature the pro-
gram. A. F. Simpson was elected class
Salutatorian, and will make a brief, and
no doubt characteristic, address. He will
be followed in turn by the class orator,
A. M. (Piggy) Martin, and the
valedictorian, D. B. Wharton.

Agnes Scott President
Makes Literary Address
Dr. J. R. McCain to Speak Before

Graduating Class and Friends
Tuesday Morning

Davidson College and the Senior Class
are fortunate in securing President J. R.
McCain as the Annual Literary Ad-
dressee for the Commencement of 10925.
This annual address will be delivered in
Shearer Hall at 12:15 p. m, Tuesday,
June 2nd. This occasion is one of the
outstanding features of every commence-
ment, and this year it seems reasonable
that with the speaker who has been en-
gaged the event will not fall short of
those in past years, and furthermore bids
fair as one of the very best Literary ad-
dresses that has been heard at Davidson
College. The speaker of the morning is
President J. R. McCain, of Agnes Scott
College, Decatur, Ga., a prominent figure
in educational circles of the South. As
President of Agnes Scott he has made a
name for himself enviable in itself and
attained by few. Agnes Scott College is
the most outstanding girls’ college in the
South, it is affiliated with the Southern
Presbyterian Church, but is not under
its control; being Presbyterian at heart
it is the sister college to Davidson. By
his personality and character Dr. Mc-
Cain has placed himSelf at the head of
this remarkable institution, and, as has
already been intimated, he has advanced
the college in many ways since his be-
coming President in 1923. President Mc-
Cain has distinguished himself as an/
educator and writer, and has been’ par-
ticularly active in such work in the state

Gamma Chapter

Phi Beta Kappa
Initiates Four

The spring. initiation exercises of the
Gamma of North Carolina Chapter’ of
Phi Beta Kappa were held last Saturday
night, May 30th. Four men of the class
of 1925 were formally received into mem-
bership at this meeting, as follows: H. B.
Price, D. B. Wharton, C. S, Furches, and
W. C. Ramsey.

These four men bring the total stu-|'

dent membership in the local chapter to
seven, the other members, M. W. Tra-
wick, W. W. Purdy, and A. T. Rowe, hav-
ing been initiated last December.’ The
Senior class has stood unusually high in
scholastic average this year, and these
men are among the highest of the class.
Besides proving their intellectual ability,
the recent initiates have shown them-
selves to be leaders in the activities of the
campus. Harry Price has just finished va
most successful term as president of the
Y. M.C. A., and has captained the Wild-
cat tennis’ team this spring. Benton

Wharton has distinguished himself in in-
tercollegiate debating,
much work in: literary lines.
