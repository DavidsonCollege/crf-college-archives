Hoops looks to continue winning ways

By MIcHAEL KRusE

The last time we saw the men’s
basketball team, it walked off South
Carolina’s McGuire Arena court
dejected, victims of a 100-73 NIT
defeat to the Gamecocks, a bru-
tally anticlimactic and abrupt con-
clusion to what was until the final
two games a dream season for the
Wildcats.

_A stunning loss to Western
Carolina in the Southern Confer-
ence championship game had
dropped Davidson out of the
NCAA picture.

The Catamounts went on to
steal the national thunder, nearly
upending top-seeded Purdue, while
the Wildcats, still numb from West-
ern, died an agonizing death in
Columbia.

by a 14-0

at Davidson.

“We definitely had a great
team last year,” said Narcisse
Ewodo, this year’s lone senior and
returning starter.

Only three schools in the coun-
try — Kentucky, UMass, and
Uconn - posted more wins than
Davidson, which ranked ninth in
the nation in scoring and fourth in
scoring margin.

“We had a lot of talent, a lot of
chemistry,” Ewodo continued.
“And we lost a lot. This year’s
going to be a big challenge.”

Indeed. Five seniors from last

But to record another winning
season and another postseason push

for Davidson - would not,

The Wildcats, tabbed second
in the conference’s North Division
behind Marshall in the preseason
media and coaches polls, is well-
schooled, shoots the ball extremely
well, and vaunts powerful new-
comers.

And perhaps more impor-
tantly, the team is now used to
winning and has grown to expect
it.

McKillop, now in his seventh
year as head coach, has established
a consistent winner in the best
Davidson squads since the glory
years three decades ago under the
legendary Lefty Driesell.

In\the last three seasons, the
Wildcats have posted a pair of 20-
win campaigns and NIT appear-
ances and more victories than any
other Southern Conference school.

Last year’s seniors finished as
the winningest class in program
history and left behind an indelible
mark of winning.

passed. They’ ve been able to pass
on a bit of their legacy on how to
win games,” said McKillop.

what McKillop calls “a highly re-

Donnelly, a shooting guard
with a deadly three-pointer, can
score in bunches. During the two
years Donnelly has played (he
redshirted1994-95), the Wildcats
have posted 47 wins.

going to come from me and Mark,

Ewodo. “I

Mark Donnelly _ Holmes (6-9,
So.), who logged, statistically
speaking, a better rookie campaign
than Harwood, will vault into a
starting role. Holmes boasts a fun-
damentally sound low-post reper-
toire and shot-blocking abilities.

Ali Ton (6-0, So.) and Billy
Armstrong (6-2, Jr.) will both see
significant action at point guard.

Both vocal, fiery competitors,
the duo will attemptto replace four-
year starter Alpert, Davidson’ s all-
time assists leader.

Croatian Davor Halbauer (6-
3), the third international player on
McKillop’s squad along with
Ewodo (Cameroon) and Ton (Tur-
key), boasts a potent long- range
shot.

“Davor has been just a great
surprise for us,” said McKillop.
“He’s quick, great on the dribble,
and one of the best shooters on the
team, but he has to adjust to the
American style of game.”

Guard Jeff Bergman (6-3), a
champion scholastic high-jumper
and long-jumper, is a gifted ath-
lete.

David Burns (6-7, So.), a pro-
lific schoolboy scorer who has the
potential to be the same at the
collegiate level, is a high-rising
forward with one of the team's
smoothest shots,

and con-:

Walk-on Chris Stec, who has
earned a permanent spot on the
roster with two years of commit-
ment to the program, is an adept
defender and open court shooter.

Ben Ebong (6-8, Jr.), who
could have returned second semes-
ter, has elected to sit out the whole
season to maintain two full years
of eligibility.

“We’ re not going to desert the
style of play wehad lastyear. We’re

_ going to continue to defend, use

the bench, and run the court,” said
McKillop. “Coachability is the
biggest strength forthis team. Sec-
ond is chemistry.

“It’s a team that doesn’t have
a significant number of seniors and
not very many upperclassmen with
experience. Butif we can get them
experience and confidence, we can
round ourselves into a pretty good
team this year.”

And the team will be hard-
pressed to do anything but gain
experience in the early going, as
the Wildcats face one of the tough-
est non-conference schedules in
the country.

Games against national pre-
season player of the year Tim
Duncan and Wake Forest, Missis-
sippi, Southern Methodist, Duke,
Mecklenburg rival UNC Charlotte,
and Massachusetts - a Final Four
team last year - should be learning
experiences if nothing else, and
potentially confidence-building
upsets heading into league action
in January.

“Tt is an ambitious, challeng-
ing, extraordinary step for our pro-
gram,” said McKillop of the sched-
ule. “The potential for failure is
clearly more glaring than the po-
tential for success (in non- eOnTeY:
ence games). :

“Are we going to fold our tents
from December or are we going to
learn and move on from there?”
asked McKillop. “TI believe we
have talent and that talent matures
and grows. Whether that happens
in February or March or not until
next season, I don’t know.”

More questions. But ques-
tions can be answered.

“They are the most fundamen-
tally sound team in the confer-
ence,” said Western coach Phil
Hopkins. “He (McKillop) is going
to prepare them for every game.”

“Davidson’s a model pro-
gram,” added first-year Marshall
head coach Greg White. “When
McKillop started, they weren’t
winning 20 games a year.”

“We don’t have as much tal-
ent, we don’t have as many ath-
letes as we did last year,” said
Ewodo. “But we have good play-
ers and we’re going to work hard.

“And I think we can live up to
those expectations.”
