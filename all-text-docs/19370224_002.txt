Truth always rises above falsehood, as oil rises above
water.—Spanish Proverb.

We express our sincerest sympathy for
Reid Patterson in the recent loss of his
father, Dr. J. R. Patterson.

HISSING AND BOOING... Three things are
known to hiss—a goose, a viper, and from ac-
tions of our Student Body at the Wake
Forest-Davidson basketball game, we may add
the Davidson students.

First, you hiss and boo because the referee
makes a mistake. We will grant that the ref-
erees did make a good many mistakes, but
the booing of a flock of students does not
change his decision, nor does it aid the players
in shooting the next goal. You hiss and
boo when a seemingly deliberate foul is made
on one of our players. The referee will com-
pensate for the foul, without the extra noise.

Let what you say be better than silence, and
this certainly cannot be said of thosé audible
sounds, typical of a Yahoo.

It is extremely unsportsman-like to boo
and higs a Yet, the Wake Forest
players were visitors. When we visit them,
we expect and hope to receive a courteous
and friendly greeting; if we do not they will
be returning our compliments.

It is not the basketball games alone where
this lamentable situation but at our
other contests, and under other circumstances.

“Let what you say be better than silence.”

ern Conference Tournament in Raleigh, and
we sincerely hope they do. We stand. tenth in

NEEDED ... Not included in our Centennial
building program is one need which becomes
more felt on every week-end. We have no
adequate place to lodge visiting alumni, trus-
tees, or other guests. Faculty and townspeople
are unusually generous in opening their homes
to these out of town visitors; but each time
an athletic contest or social event brings them
to the campus more and more are forced to
remain in Charlotte. Many colleges similarly
‘situated provide an inn for the accommoda-
tion of such friends.

Conservatism .. .

All of us would be liberals in the sense Dr.
Foreman suggested in his chapel talk the
other morning. Most of us would dread to be
called conservatives in the narrow sense of
the word. College students are traditionally
radical, eternally on the search for new hori-
zons.

We do not know whether our own group is
typical of undergraduates as a whole, but cer-
tainly the student body at Davidson is over-
whelmingly conservative. And sometimes our
reaction is conservative in the worst sense.
We have a tendency to oppose change simply
because it is change, to cherish outmoded cus-
toms because they have become “traditions.”

The “shine” complex which inhibits the in-
dividual student from doing anything original
or different, the “fire bug” which makes us
_embarrass our female visitors, the “thunder-
ing herd’ which destroys lawns between
Chambers and the post office, the lack of good
taste which tolerates reading newspapers in
chapel or sleeping in church, all these have
outgrown whatever dubious value they may
have once possessed. If we must cling to tra-
dition we might choose things more worth-
while.

Literary Digest Asks...

The following questionnaire, distributed un-
der the auspices of the Literary Digest, was
sent out in an effort to ascertain the college
student’s reaction to the liquor question.

1, Regardless of restriction, where, what,
when, and how much do undergraduates in
your institution drink?

2. How closely are college regulations for
drinking observed?

3. In what way has liquor consumption
varied since repeal? :

4. What has been the noticeable effect
upon and reaction of the Student Body?

5. Are there any other ideas that you have
on the subject as it applies to your institution,
and have you any specific recommendations
to make?

We believe that the driest answer possible
can be made to the first four questions. It is
not the regulations so much, which afford the
above answer but the, nature and inclinations
of the members of our Student Body.

Our recommendation would include the cen-
sorship of all publicity, depicting college stu-
dents as drunkards—and the esfatlishment of
a center to distribute propaganda against
drinking. If these recommendations can not
be achieved, it would seem best to’let the sit-
uation remain as it is.

| Campus Comments

It is as natural for a college student to
“gripe” as it is for him to eat. I suspect that
even the loyal sons of Utopia College would
find something to complain about, even if it
were nothing else than the fact that there was
nothing to complain about. No doubt this is
quite fortunate, for without Some dissatisfac-
tion somewhere, the old world would stagnate
in its present imperfect state, and we would
be fofced to abandon our theory of the per-
fectibility of mankind. It is this dissatisfac-
tion with the status quo which motivates all
progress, and without it Davidson College
would soon die a natural death.

Of course there are any number of oppor-
tunities for improvement on this campus
which are apparent to everybody, and I heart-
ily second most of the complaints and sugges-
tions for improvement which have appeared
previously in this column. I, also, have at
times, had my pet “gripe,” which I didn’t hesi-
tate to impart freely to whomever happened
to be within earshot. Now, however, when
the time comes for me to air my views, I find
that I have nothing much to add. In trying to
think of some subject for a justifiable com-
plaint, | have thought of a number of things
which I think warrant being passed on in the
form of “Advice to Gripers.”

First: Be sure that your complaint is justi-
fiable. Be tolerant at all times, and realize
that the other fellow has as much right to his
opinion as you have to yours. Try to realize
that what you have decided is the right thing
for you is not necessarily the right thing for
someone else.

Second: Don’t gripe just for the sake of
griping. Be sure that the change you are ad-
vocating is for the better.

Third: When you are convinced that the
adoption of your idea will result in improve-
ment, then do something about it. Go to the
right party to make your complaint, and don’t
get the reputation of being a chronic griper
by broadcasting to the world at large.

Manager of The Davidsonian, to write the

It seems that even stooges break

Our little sisters at Queens, in
their Family Relations class, re-
cently decided that the qualities
which make an ideal husband are:
health, congeniality, and a Christian
character. Other desired qualities
were a good heritage, good disposi-
tion, adequate income, business abil-
ity, thoughtfulness and respect for
wife, consideration for others, and
a well-rounded personality. Or in
other words—the Davidson Man.
Look in the nearest mirror and then
draw your own conclusions. For a
more general attitude the Queens

Lavendar Lace,” in Dorothy Park-

“It was back quite a few years
ago that Wake Forest College and
Davidson met to determine the fi-
nal standing of the Big Five base-
ball conference. Davidson came to
Wake Forest to snare the cham-
pionship, and a defeat for either
team would mean the clinching of
the flag for the other. Coach Phil
Utley had been secured to act as
the officiator of balls and strikes.

“The early stages of the
found the Deacons rolling up a
tremendous score. So when the
ninth inning came for the Davidson
boys to do or die, Wake Forest was
ahead 10-0. Fans were starting to
leave the diamond, They had a right
to think that the game was over
and that Wake Forest had won the
championship. But hang on gang,
here is where the fun begins.

“With two men out, and only one
game for the Big Five title, a little
man steps up to the plate with no
one on the pond. He lets two go
by for strikes. The next three
pitches are balls. The big pitch or
the Wheaties special is due to go
in. Coach Phil gets set; the batter

ball floats in and the batter starts
toward first. Coach Phil yells,
‘strike three, you're out!”

“Wake Forest had won the flag,
but no, there seems to be an argu-
ment between the batter from Dav-
idson and Coach Phil. The Wild-
catter claimed he had been robbed.
Well, his story got into the smiling
coach’s skin, and the Dean of Dea-
con coaches broke down and gave
him another chance. Coach Utley
figured that since we were so far
ahead that the Wildcats couldn't
possibly catch us. So once again
the batter took a last cut at the
ball, but this time he got on the
pond.

“And before the Deacons could
stem the tide, Davidson had taken
the championship right out of our
hands by pushing over 11 runs in
the first half of the ninth inning,
We were unable to score at/all in
our half of the same inning.”

The story sounds good if it isn’t
true, but we are in absolute con-
cord with Mr. Philips in accepting
the story as accurate throughout.

The morning’s mail brings a Igtter

from our old contemporary, the
Queens Blues’ Ima Heart-healer.
It is learned with misgivings that
she is discontinuing her advice-to-
the-lovelorn column in that worthy
sheet—with misgivings because it
has, during its all-too-short exist-
ence, been an ever dependable
source of material when the col-
umn seemed to stretch from here to
there and back again. This being
Washington's birthday, I would
suggest to Ima that we not only
bury the hatchet, as per her sugges-
tion, but that we do the thing up
right and bury it in a cherry tree.
So long, Ima, hate to see you go.
The thought of you ignoring dead-
lines and copy calls, looking at a
typewriter without murmuring “Yes
Master,” and generally living the
life of non-columnistic leisure, turns
this writer as green as the ink with
which your first effort was printed.

What with the journalistic demise
of Ima Hearthealer and the execu-
tion of Bismarck, this is beginning
to look like the obituaries column.
And while on the sulaject, let us
comment on the iminent passing of
Old Man Winter, who seems even
now to be on his last legs. He’s done
a pretty poor job of it, too, as win-
ters go. All rain and no snow make
Jack Frost a dull boy: However,
we will be glad to call it even if
the old blow-hard will just ease
out of the picture and let spring
have a chance. We long for grass
and birds and stuff.

We mentioned it last week, but
something has come up to make us
repeat ourselves. The Pan-Hellenic
Council has informed your scribe
that the radio announcer at the
night mid-winters omitted the name
of Davidson College on both of Jan
Garber’s broadcasts because he had
previously received very definite in-
structions to the effect that he
should. This is something beyond
our understanding. If ever a col-
lege needed just the kind of ad-
vertisement that broadcasts of a
Jan Garber Mid-Winters can give,
it is old D. C. The Davidson spirit
is, we pride ourselves, the tops;
but the only way to keep it so is
to make future student bodies anx-
to come here. The kind of
publicity the college authorities has
a very definite and very needful ap-
peal to the parents who send sons
to Davidson — well and good. But
young men themselves want to
know more about the school of
their choice than that it is a denom-
inational college sponsored by the
Presbyterian Church. They want
to know that they will be amused
and happy outside the class room,
and the only way to assure them of
this is to make public the good
times we all enjoy here.

Do you agree, or don’t you?

We understand that the treas-
urer has just placed an order for
250 new beds. Springs in the air!
This is tangible proof that the ad-
ministration recognizes that the
best place for creative thought is
in bed—doesn’t Mae West write her
stuff between the sheets? Don’t
know whether I favor the order
personally or not though. It’s hard
enough to get up in the morning
now. With springs in my bed, I’m
sure I’ll never make it before noon.
