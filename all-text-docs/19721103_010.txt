Defense Keys Clubber’s Win

By DAVID MELTON
Asst. Sports Editor

The Davidson Club Football
team hasn't scored a touchdown
this year. It has scored two
safeties. however. and
Saturday a safety was enough
to capture the clubbers first
victory ever.

The lone score, a satety on a
blocked punt. came in the
second period of Saturday
morning's game with UNC. and
gave the Cats a 2-0 victory.

Chris Young, a sophomore.
was the culprit for the Cats.

‘We had a return on but there
was just nobody on the way
in, and I ran in and blocked it
with my knee," said Young.

Coach and quarterback Carl
Rizzo praised the ‘great’’ play
of Mike Tombari, Bob Wetzel,
Frank Rader, Eric “Big E”™
Scharling, and David Bowman
for the defense.

‘‘We won the game, and that
was a great thing.” Rizzo said.
“We played our guts out
holding them back.’

Rizzo praised the defense,
and said *“‘The defense won the
game. The rest of the game was
just a bloody, bloody mess."

There was much confusion
about the scheduling of the
game.

It was first scheduled for
Sunday afternoon, but the UNC
team couldn't keep the date, so
the game was changed to
Saturday.

Rizzo discussed the play of
the offense by saying “Our
offense just didn't make it."

The Cat offense has been
hampered by inconsistency all
season, but Rizzo seemed to
think it will begin to gel.

*‘We discovered our passing
game in practice this week.”
said Rizzo, and he added that
“play passes and_ two-
platooning should really help
us.

The clubbers next game is
with NC State at Raleigh.

Friday night at 8:30.

The game may have to be
cancelled however. depending
on whether the Cats will have
enough players here to sport a
team.

reception by Jim Brown. From
there it was all over for the
SPEs as they were unable to get
their well organized attack in
gear.

Although the Delts were
missing middle line backer
Mitch Purvis due to a torn
achilles tendon they were able
to rally and record their first
shut out of the year.

The defense spearheaded by
Robert Banta kept SPE
quarterback Bill Higgins
scrambling all afternoon.

The earlier rounds of. the
tournament were much more
exciting than the lopsided final.
In the opening round Fanny &
Mabel's nipped PAX 26-25, the
winning touchdown scored in
the waning moments by Randy
Ely ona sleeper play.

In the other game in that
bracket the SPEs started their
drive to the finals by slipping
past the SAEs 13-7.

The other bracket showed
Delt no. 2 beating Delt no. 1 in
an interesting intrahouse
contest. Later that evening
there was a large disturbance
reported to the security force
involving the area surrounding
the Delt house. The results of
the post game activities were
not in as of press time.

Also in the bottom bracket the
PIKAs defeated the KAs 19-13 in
a replay of the Night They
Drove Old Dixie Down.

The semifinal match between

The clubbers have been
beaten by State once already
this vear, but Rizzo pointed out
that “State beat us with a
quarterback who is now an
ineligible plaver.”

the SPEs and the PIKAs was an
exciting contest as the SPEs
nosed out the PIKAs 25-21. The
other semi was a 26-6 romp by
PDT no. 2 over defending
champs Fanny and Mable’s.

With their victory in
flickerball and last month's
victory in golf the Delts are
shooting 1.000 in IMAC.

Next week the results of the
voting for the IMAC flickerball
All-Stars will be announced
along with further plans for the
great three-on-three
tournament.

Also next week the results of
the wrestling tourney will be
reported.

Contrary to popular belief the
wrestling tournament was not
scheduled to give the basketball
team a breather.

Varsity practice was - held
Wednesday and Thursday in the
basement of Chambers.

In pinball news the Fooseball
Federation has given a petition
to the IMAC officials
demanding immediate
recognition as a bona fide IMAC
sport.
