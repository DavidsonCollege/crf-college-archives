Report on Loyalty
League Given Out
by Ernest Milton

The Alumni Secretary has just sent out
letters to all alumni, giving a review of
the Loyalty League subscriptions. The
result of the drive for more subscribers
although gratifying should be bigger. and
better.. The class of 1873 is the oldest
class to contribute, two of its members
have made pledges. The class of 1910
has the largest number of members to
contribute while the class of 1914 has
made the largest contribution. Every
class since 1885, except the class of 1890
and 1925, up to the past graduating class,

-have made contributions. There has
been a total of 205 alumni who have made
contributions, and there have been two
honorary contributions.

J. C. Nixon, class of roo9, was married
on August 23rd, to Miss Elizabeth EI-
liot, of Pineville, Kentucky.

It was thought that the classroom space
in the new south wing would alleviate
the cramped condition to a great degree,
but in the meantime the institution had
been growing in numbers, and the pres-
‘ent facilities ‘are still inadequate, the
laboratory work being scattered in sev-
eral buildings with insufficient room to
properly function,

Since this generous donation has been
given to the college, officials of David-
son will begin a concerted effort to raise
| sufficient funds to complete the entire
building. As soon as $100,000 is obtained
‘from alumni and friends, work will be
istarted on the auditorium, which will

sert that it would be a‘ saving to be able
