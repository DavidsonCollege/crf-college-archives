DAVIDSON PRINTING COMPANY, |

After December Tenth |

As Dean Bailey made known to the student body Thursday in
Chapel—we were there this time—the information contained in
our “seoop” of last week concerning the removal of ‘restrictions
on student automobiles was official.

Though The Davidsoninn appreciates the cooperation and
consideration slown in allowing us to be the first to release the
happy news, it is not on that basis tliat this editorial is being
written. What we have to say is solely for the benefit. and in
ihe best. interests of the student body. | 7

In permitting any student to bring a car to the campus, and
to keep it here at his own diseretion—under no restriction ex-
cept in the matter of parkinig areas—the executive committee
is eondueting two experiments in one.

Aside from, the obvious issue of trying to determine whether
or not the number of cars which are kept on the campus under
the new regulations will be greater than can be accommodated
by the College and the town, the committee is making an ex-
periment which will reveal the degree of our maturity.

We have been given a golden opportunity to prove to our
own. satisfaction and that of the College, something all of us
believe and most.of us live up to—the fact that we are capable
of accepting responsibility, and handling it with judgment.

Our obligation to each other and to the student body as a
whole is clearly evident. Any individual using his car carelessly
and without consideration for others is not only proving that
he himself still belongs in high school, but is stamping the

label ‘‘irresponsible” on the entire student body.

Tf éach of us accepts this newly granted responsibility, and
realizes that we are being regarded as the adults we think we
are, December tenth will be 9 most welcome day indeed.

Rhodes Scholarship

After having been a student here at Davidson three or four
years. we sometimes come to ignore or overlook some of our
most valuable assets. We perhaps take for granted many of the
opportunities that surround us. In failing to identify these op-
portunities with ourselves, we run the risk of losing what might
otherwise have been of real worth to us.

Such ‘an opportunity presents itself in the form of the Rhodes
Scholarships. The period of éxtended study at Oxford which
these scholarships provide makes it possible for any outstand-
ing student — and there are many such here at Davidson — to
enrich his life immeasurably; and in a most practical way to
equip himself with what is perhaps the best liberal education
the academie world has to offer.

An opportunity of such far-reaching possibilities merits the
attention of every senior who has bebind him a superior
scholastic record.

Homecoming Weekend

If we allow ourselves beeause of the constant demands
everyday routine — to pass up such limitless opportunities,
without at least a superficial investigation of the pertinent

Although much has been said about the Homeeoming week-
end, at the risk of a few repetitions, a few observations about
it would not be out of order.

First, for this week-end to be the success that it is hoped to
he will require the support of every student in the student body.
In the past a few students have thought of this week-end as a
good one for that trip home or for other trips. While there is
probably very little danger of that this year. nevertheless it
would be well for us to remember that we may witness the
beginning of a new era in the history of Davidson College. To
miss an opportunity of this kind would be regretted in later
years, ,

Secondly, little has been said about the dances, other than
the information concerning when they will be and the orchestra.
As was pointed out in the last issue of the DAVIDSONIAN
these dances are for the entire student body and their success
depends upon their support. A very excellent orchestra has
been secured.

facts involved, we are in danger of narrowing the scope of our
lives,

These dances have long been a tradition of Davidson, there-.
fore, as we build new traditions, at the same time let's support
the old ones and make this set of dances the best in the history
of the college. It is still not too late to make plans for what will
be one of the social highlights of the year.

Thirdly,-the decorations around the school, dormitories and
fraternities will add a great deal to this festive occasion and
impress the alumni. However, decorating on such a large scale
requires a lot of time and energy from somebody.:A small group
of men cannot possibly accomplish this tremendous task alone.
therefore if you are called on to help, and doubtless you will
be, give as much of your time as possible.

“The Bounder” & Ca., Publishers

To whomever it may concern the
editing and produting of The
Davidsonian is a colossal under-
taking requiring the skills and ideas

of a large group of specialists.

Due to the rule of austerity
which has prevailed on the cam-

pus since the issue of the April

Fool's edition, the paper has had
to go underground in order to
maintain its position of open-mind-
ed liberalism. Because of this mi-
gration, the editors are known only
by aliases. The editor-in-chief is
known by his associates as “The
Bounder.’’ His closest associate
and bodyguard is called “Round-
man.” These men with the help of
the writers who have not yet becn
discovered by the ‘“gusterly police”

on the ethics of good- journalism.
This usually lasts for two hours
and then the staff gets down
to work,

The first job is the editing of
copy that has come in from foreign
correspondents. The Davidsonian
has correspondents at the north
‘and south poles, one in the Bel-
gian Congo and one in Sub-Slobo-
via. These reporters guarantee the
paper a thorough coverage of in-
ternational events.

The sports department has just
about the hardest time. The sports
reporters are sent. with all of the
athletic teams in special limou-
sines and must file their copy at
least two days after a game. The
sports editor said that this year
was going to be pretty busy since
the school had three all-Americans.

The department contemplates en-
larging the sports section from ten

pages to fifteen pages. However
this is unlikely since the school
has ordered the discontinuance of
snowballing as a major sport.

The city desk is just a cut and
dried part of the paper due to the
austerity police which hand out
storetyped communiques on local
events.

At the present there is no edi-
torial page. The second page has
‘been converted to a bulletin board
which has eliminated announce-
ments in chapel.

Advertising has also been abol-
ished because one ad manager slip-
‘ped up and let a Rootbeer plug

get on the back page.

This organization functions as
a well oiled machine. The only
flaw in the works is an occasional
suicide which occurs when a front
page has to be remade at 10:45.

Leaving this rueful aspect of our
college life, and turning to the
matter at its center—What Is Edu-
cation? by Tom Prufer:

‘Anyone who wants an educa-
tion and thinks that he is becom-
ing educated should know what
education is. We all have a vague
idea, but vagueness tends to con-
fusion and falsity, To go anywhere
we need a map, and a blurred map
is of little use in really getting
there. Some clear lines, however,
have been drawn for us in three
hooks: Education at the Crossroads
by Jacques Maritain, Liberal Edu-

cation by Mark van Doren, and
How To Read A Book by Marti-
mer Alder.

The first is an analysis of, basic
and prevalent grrors in American
education, which are countered by
a clear statement of the true aims
of education, interior and spiritual,
always hard to attain, but especial-
ly- in the modern world. There is
a presentation of the dispositions
necessary at the very heart of the
student. “Truth does not depend
on us, but on what is,” so educa.
tion is not getting something, but
giving oneself to a task of discoy-
ery.

Van Doren’s book, doth rich
and succinct, often achieving a
mastery of style and statement,
sets forth education as the process
whereby the person becomes free;
free from his own false opinions,
and blind-alley desires. Education
is a deepening of insight, a steadi-
ness against giddy changes and
opinions, and a command of the
means of communication.

Ader discusses more practical
matters — what to do now. He
gives advice and rules about what
and how to read. The greatest
teachers are far from us either in
time or in space, but we can learn
from them simply by mastery of
the art of reading.

These books are maps, clear, col-
orful, detailed, and true to the ter-
tain, if anyone wants to go the way
of getting an education.

EARLY FUND RAISING
Davidson's first financial cam-
paign was held in 1836 when $30,-
000 was raised to open the college.
Now Davidson is working toward
a $2,500,000 goal in its current cam-
Paign.

CAMPUS COST $1,521
The Davidson College Campus,
comprising 469 acres, was purchas-
ed in 1863 for $1,521, or $3.25 per

fion. Herbert loover
Washington, D. C.
Qear Mr, Hoover,

! am taking this opportunity to,
ipprise you of a situation in David-
on College which you may find
interesting.

It all began when I registered
for my courses at, ~
the beginning .
this semester.
One of the cours.
es that I signed
up for at that
time was politi-
cal science 71,
the ‘study o

macy. Shortly ae id

Aimerican 1 diplo

ter the semester began, however,
I decided that. t would rather
audit the course, in order not to
have a large amount of ‘my time
consumed by parallel reading.
Therefore, 1 set about to discon-
tinue taking the course for credit
and tO audit it. 1 went to the office
of the Registrar, told him what 1
wanted, and assured him that it
would in uo way alfect my cligi-
bility to graduate in my class, He
informed me then that if | would
yet the permission of ‘the profes-
sor to drop the course and would
return to his office, he would make |
from that
point. Having done that, 1 was in.
formed by the Registrar that in
order to audit the course that I had
just discontinued, 1 must get the

—_

4 ‘ aie

permission of the professor —
again — and of the Dean of the
Faculty. 1 followed these direc-

tions implicitly, and assumed then
that the whole matter was closed.

Y
a

The following week cut this
course which I was auditing, and
received a cut-card for it from the
Dean of Students. [| wem to the
Dean’s office and informed him
that | was no longer talane polit.
cal science 71 for credit, and that
therefore the cuts that I take in
that course should not count on
my aggregate of cunts. The Dean
replied that he had not received
word from the Registrar’s office
to that effect, snd that | should
wo to the Registrar and get him
to place a notation on the cut-
card, and tien return to his (the
Dean's) office. Upon going to the
Registrar's office, ] was informed
shat the matter of cutting an audit-
ed course was under the jurisd'c-
tion of the Dean of the Faculty,
and that I should get him, and not
the Registrar, to make the no'ation
on the cut-card as the Dean of
Students had requested. When I
confronted the Dean of the Facul.
ty with my request, he replied that
he had nothing official telling him
that I was only auditing political
science. 71, and that for all he
knew I might be asking him to
abrogate a cut in a course that I
was taking for credit. However, at
my insistence he assured me that
he would: “look into the matter,"’
and I, being then just on the rag-
ged edge of sanity, left the entire
matter in his hands. .

I am writing to ask you, Mr.
Hoover, to investigate this Bureau-
cracy which exists in the adminis-
tration of Davidson College, and
to learn if possible just what my
relation is to political science 71 at
this time. .

Very respectfully yours,
GABRIEL LOWE.
