Forum will let students

share views on social life

Vagt, Shandley ask
for input on how to

Court opportunities

A campus-wide forum will be held Nov.
14 to help administrators. improve social
life at Davidson.

College President Bobby Vagt and Dean
of Students Tom Shandley will host the
forum to hear complaints, criticisms and
suggestions from students on a wide range
of issues, especially those pertaining to
the Knobloch Campus Center and
Patterson Court.

“We’re not going down there with an
agenda,” Said Vagt. “We’re going down
with a pen and pad. This is intended to be
a conversation.” .

Added Shandley: “We’re there largely
to listen rather than to talk.”

Vagt said he hopes the forum will help
to answer one fundamental question:
“What is the student body looking for
when we talk about social life?”

He said no single event prompted the
idea, but it came to mind after he heard
that brothers from the Kappa Sigma fra-
ternity had planned an Oktoberfest party
at an off-campus house occupied by
Davidson students. He wondered why the
brothers felt the need to go off-campus for
such an event.

The forum is intended to give students a
chance to answer these types of questions,
voice concerns and share ideas, he said.

The $31 million dollar Knobloch Cam-
pus Center, in the works for over a decade,
finally opened its doors in August. Vagt
hopes students will share ideas on how its
potential can be maximized.

With renovations beginning soon on the
school’s 12 fraternity and eating houses
and the BSC, Vagt hopes to also learn ways
to improve life on Patterson Court.

Part of the problem, he said, is that the
houses are in “awful” condition, and are
only used for meals and parties. He hopes
students will provide suggestions on how
the houses can be better utilized.

The school’s alcohol and disciplinary
policies will also be open for discussion.
Such issues have come under scrutiny in
recent weeks, after one fraternity was pun-
ished for playing drinking games and serv-
ing an illegal substance, and another was
investigated following allegations of dis-
crimination during a late-night party.

Shandley said the forum wasn’t called
because of such incidents, but they are not
off-limits during the forum.

“If students bring (alcohol) up as an
issue, that’s fine,” he said.

SGA President Joey Harris said he hopes
the forum will help to clear up students’
misconceptions about school policies, espe-
cially those pertaining to Patterson Court.

“It’s important not to let (Patterson Court)
overshadow all the other things that are going
on, but it is a big part,” he said.

“Dialogue is important to stop the rumor

mill and the misconceptions, so that we get-

down to what’s really going on.

This is one-on-one with the students. They:
can get it right from the horses’ mouth. That
more than anything else is what will get
students to come out.”
