Eighteen Delegates Repre-
sent Davidson at State
Volunteer Conference

New Visions of Life Service Caught by
Many Students—Unusually Strong
Speakers Held Places on Program

The Student Volunteer Conference, in
session at Trinity College from February
23th through February 27th, was mark-
ed by addresses by the leading spirits in
the mission world. The 18 delegates
from Davidson have returned with
stories of deeper consecration and a new
vision of life service. The whole con-
ference caught the spirit of the motto,
“The evangelization of the world in this
generation.”

Friday's Session.

Devotional exercises conducted by
Rev. C, N. Hounshell began the first ses-
sion Friday night. Due to the illness of
President Few, of Trinity, the address
of welcome was delivered by Prof. James
Cannon, of the Bible Department of
Trinity. D. W. Roberts, of Davidson,
president of the conference, responded
in behalf of the delegates.

The address of the evening was deliv-
ered by Dr. Egbert W. Smith, on the sub-
ject of the “Challenge of the Missionary
Call to Young Men and Women.” Dr.
Smith asked the question, “What shall

-I do with my life?” He answered this
question by many striking parables and
impressed the point that “all ambitions
which interfere with the realization of a
life of service are a sin.”

Saturday Morning,

Fay Campbell, of Yale, traveling secre-
tary of the movement, gave a speech on
“Missionary Work in Our Colleges.” He
used general discussions and an open
forum to bring out his points. The
four words, “Know, Pray, Pay, Go,” con-
stituted his theme and many helprul
suggestions were offered by the differ-
ent delegations for the more effective
pursuance of their work.

Rev. S. W. Erickson, a Presbyterian
missionary to Japan, next spoke on “The
Gospel in Action,” The moral and re-
ligious life of our progressive brother
across the Pacific was vividly shown
and Mr. Erickson made an appeal fer
more workers to direct this rising coun-
try in the ways of Christ.

GAMMA SIGMA EPSILON
ENTERTAINED AT BANQUET
BY DR. ARBUCKLE

Setting aside its more serious prob-
lems, the Gamma Sigma Epsilon Chemi-
cal Fraternity on last Monday was the
guest of Dr. and Mrs. H. B. Arbuckle at
a banquet luncheon, served in the home
of the host and hostess.

While enjoying the delicious four-
course dinner, prepared by the com-
petent hands of the hostess, the guests
were entertained by the several witty
and humorous toasts of. Dr. Arbuckle.
The host also made a short talk on the
brilliant prospects for a glowing future
of the fraternity and offered several
well directed suggestions as to how it
can improve conditions locally.

After retiring from the festive table,
an informal discussion was entered upon
in which it was decided to try to get Dr.
Remsen, president of John Hopkins
University, to deliver an address to the
student body some time in April.

The occasion was enjoyed by all,
thanks to Dr. Arbuckle and his wife,
who planned an ideal evening and con-
sequently fanned the flame of warm
friendship which the students hold to-
ward them.

MANY ARTICLES OF UNUSUAL All Indications Point to a

MAGAZINE FOR MARCH

The March issue of the Davidson Col-
lege Magazine came out on¢time. This
issue of the magazine is full of clever
short stories.

“Bought at 24.76” is probably the best
college life story published in the maga-
zine in some time. If this story does
not keep ‘you guessing there’s something
wrong with you.

Have you ever been to the Yellow-
stone National Park? If you haven't,
read the description of the first day’s
journey into that magnificent park ir
“Yellowstone National Park.” If you
have, read it and learn how it‘'impresses
other people.

“Envy or Pity?" is an interesting es-
say on the upbringing of missionaries’
children. Can you answer the question:
Envy or pity? Then read this article.

The student who wrote “Orange Rum
is to be envied for his ability to write
negro dialect, Boys, “read ‘em, an’
weep!”

The next issue of the magazine goes to
press on the 16th of March. The staff

requests that all contributions be sent].

in before the 14th. Every type of maga-

zine work is acceptable: short stories, |;

essays, and especially poetry. Fellows,
let's fill the next issue with short stories
just as good as those in this month’s
issue. And how about ‘that poetry?
Just put those thoughts about “her” 'n
everything on paper, and hand ’em in.
C’m on, ain't spring here!

Large Number of Men
Answer First Call for
Baseball Candidates

Eight Letter Men Back to Contend for
Positions — Prospects Especially
Good for Strong Staff of
Pitchers and Catchers

Last Thursday the call was issued for
all men going out for pitcher, catcher or
outfield positions to report at Sprunt
field prortptly at 3 o'clock. The result
was, about 10 pitchers, 30 outfielders and
three catchers. The first afternoon's
practice consisted mainly of “pep”
games, warming pitchers and chasing
flies in the outfield.

The new pitchers are being coached in
position by the members of last year’s

Pitching staff, consisting of “Bill” Miley, -

i“Buck” Currie, Norman Shepard and
George Sorrells. All of last season's
,twirlers are back and also some prom-
‘ising new men are showing up well. The
bulk of the pitching will probably rest
upon “Bill” Miley, captain of this year's
‘nine, “Buck” Currie and Norman Shep-
ard, All of these men did fine mound
| work last season and are expected to de-
_liver the goods this year.

The catcher’s position is not quite so
Popular as the pitcher, there being only
three out for that position. “Sim” Wrenn
who was the “star” performer behind the
;Plate last year, is back and showing alt
kinds of stuff. “Cop” Johnson another
stellar backstop on last year's nine is
jout fighting for the receiving end. Wash-
am, a new man, prominent among Cor-
nelius baseball circles is a candidate for
catcher. Judging from this the Wild-
cats are to have no trouble behind the
bat. :

Coach Hengeveld’s healthy swing is
driving the outfielders clear back to the
fence. Some of them would make the
famous Tyrus look like a back number.
The whole squad is divided up and sent
out one squad at a time, each man get-
ting a chance to show his fielding
ability. It seems that Davidson is go-
ing to have a nice fielding outfield, if

Hipple Concert Company
resents Best Lyceum
Course of Year

Program of Instrumental Music by
Four Artists Furnishes Real Treat _

Last Monday night in Shearer Hall,
C. H. Long presented, as the fourth num-
ber of the Redpath lyceum course, The
Hipple Concert Company.

Without a doubt the Hipple organiza-
tion is the best that has been seen in
Davidson for several years. The com-
pany numbered four, being composed of
three men and one woman, and every
one of them was an artist. Although
Mr. Hipple was featured as the “Wizard
of Xylophone” it seems that he was even
more a master of the slide trombone.
Mr. Knudson on the violin and flute, Mr.
Skinner on the cornet and Mrs, Hippic
on the piano were not far behind their
leader,

The program, as rendered, was ex-
ceedingly well balanced. There was
neither too much nor too little of the
standard and classical. Every well-
rounded program must contain a few of
the old standbys. Mr. Hipple was ex-
ceedingly fortunate in his choice, for the
selection from “Il Trovatore” and the
standard solos seemed to please the au-
dience. Wisely refraining from the too
blatant of the modern compositions the
company sought to entertain a certain
class with “Margy” and other numbers
of like class.

One feature of the solo renditions was
the effective support rendered the solo-
ist by the other members of the com-
pany. It is a lamentable fact that in the
usual lyceum company the soloist. is
usually left to shift for himself. In this
respect due note should be taken of the
work of Mrs. Hipple at the piano. Her
support of Mr. Knudson in his flute solo
“The Nightingale” was especially notice-
able. And again when the whole com-
pany gave Dvorak’s immortal “Hu-
moresque” Mr. Hipple varied it very
pleasingly with a trombone accompain-
ment of “Swanee River.” As a techni-'
cal stunt Mr. Hipple’s rendition of Listz’s
“Second Hungarian Rapsody.” as an
xylophone solo, will long be remembered.

WE BID YOU WELCOME, VISITORS:

|Wildcats Overwhelm the
Charlotte “Y” by
Score of 55 to 11

Entire Team Furnishes Remarkable
Exhibition of Teamwork
and Passing

In their second game of this season
with the Charlotte “Y,” Davidson came
out victorious on the college court last
Friday night by a score of 55 to 11, thus
making up for a defeat suffered at the
“Trianglars’” hands, 32 to 24 points,
carlier in the season,

The Red and Black machine was at its
best and rai away with the “Y” five by
their fast passing and unusual accuracy
in shooting.

The playing of the Charlotte bunch
was of no mean order, as they were
especially fast in their team work, up
and down the floor and were also very
good in their passing, but lost out on
account of being unable to find the bas-
ket with their shots, most of which were
attempted from a long distance.

The Wildcats soon wound up in the
first period and gained the lead by shoot-
ing the first field goal followed by sev-
eral others, the first half ending 32 to 7
in their favor.

The Ked and White bunch came back
in the second half and started off with .
a rush but were unable to break up the
shooting of the Wildcats, nor were they
able to get away from the close guard-
ing of their opponents who. refused to
allow them close-up shots.

For the Charlotte “Y"' Howell show-
ed up well both as a center and later at
forward often dribbling almost the en-
tire length of the floor at a rapid pace.
The work of Cuthbertson is worthy of
note, his guarding being very effective
in hindering the Wildcats’ passing.

For Davidson Roberts and J, Schenck
were going good; Roberts piling up 32
points in his usual manner. Crawford
as the running guard, covered the floor
very effectively and aided not only in
offensive by making 13 points, but also
did well on the defensive aiding L.
Schenck who kept the Charlotte for-
wards a safe distance from the goal.
Davis played a steady game at center
both on the defensive and the offensive.

The game was clean and fast, furnish-
ing a much better exhibit of basketball
than the score would indicate.
