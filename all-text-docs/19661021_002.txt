Worship - At Last

Despite a somewhat slow start,
caused primarily by the void in the
chaplain’s position this summer, the
faculty Religious Committee has made
a meaningful venture into the realm
of a voluntary worship service.

While the crowds at the two Wed-
nesday night services have thus far
been far from overwhelming, they
have been composed of people honest-
ly searching for a meaningful worship
experience, and they have not been
disappointed, as was too frequently
the case under the old vespers pro-
gram.

The new programs have a number
of aspects that merit commendation,
not least of which is the length: If for
no other reason, the 20-minute pro-
gram gets away from the “church”

idea. an attractive prospect to many
students. And, for the sake of sheer
convenience, the shorter program is
easier to work into a packed midweek
schedule.

The new services are genuine at-
tempts at worship, something that was
rarely seen at vespers, which ordi-
narily were theological lectures by
preachers who found it difficult to get
down to the level of student prob-
lems and thinking. Programs directed
by community figures are much more
likely to be responsive to what stu-
dents are looking for. The Wednesday
night programs have been couched in
terms of the twentieth century, not
some outdated religious gobbledygook
mouthed by too many people in the
church today.

On The Right Track

Discussion over subsidized athletics
in the past several weeks has been
fairly vigorous but somewhat misdi-
rected. Last week's letter to the edi-
tor from Basketball Coach Charles
Driesell is an excellent case in point.

Coach Driesell defended the sub-
sidized athletic program on two
grounds: first, the character and class-
room performance of his basketball
players, and second, the rosy financial
picture the basketball program enjoys.

Nobody would argue the truth of
Coach Driesell's points; both are rea-
sonably well established, though the
Athletic Department has been here-
téfore somewhat reluctant to release
any figures on its finances. and there
have been no claims that the overall
subsidized athletic program, including
football. is self-supporting.

The athletic program should not be
operated as a profit-making business
enterprise. nor has it claimed to be.
While financial solvency is an attrac-
tive prospects, it should not be the
goal of the program. When it becomes
a goal. it submerges the other. more

Let’s Hear It Now.

Davidson Gentlemen: The time to
strike is now. The traditional British-
type tan raincoat, long accepted as
standard by discriminating college
men, is in danger of losing its throne
to more daring and unconventional
fashions.

Br'tish clothiers are now manufac-
turing cotton raincoats in such untra-
ditional colors as pink, light blue and
gold. The Menswear Association of
Britain has even awarded an Oscar to
the company that broke the color har-

important aspects of the athletic pro-

‘am.
o Nor is the quality of individuals sup-
ported by athletic scholarships a valid
justification for the program. Admit-
tedly, Davidson has been fortunate to
have men of high quality character
and intelligence on its subsidized ath-
letic teams. But one cannot give the
subsidized athletic program credit for
this—the athletes that come to David-
son are drawn as much by the repu-
tation of the school as they are by the
lure of.a full athletic scholarship. Ath-
letes interested in nothing but sports
and the glory that accompanies them
end up at universities that lack the.
reputation for intellectual excellence
Davidson possesses.

Coach Driesell is. unfortunately,
right when he says Davidson's ath-
letes. “work hard and deserve every
penny of aid they receive”! But the
question is: Does Davidson want ath-
letes who play because they’re being
paid or who play for the sheer joy of
sports and a pride in Davidson Col-
lege?

Despite the fact that the recipient:

the new style will invade the Amer-
ican campus.

Thanks, But No Thanks

By LOUIS LESESNE
Editor-in-Chief

From the mass of inconsistencies ap-
pearing on this page last week in the
form of a letter to the editor from
Mr. John A. Fagg, there emerges at
least one unequivocable fact: Mr. Fagg
wants to settle. in one 30-minute chap-
el program debate, the question of
subsidized athletics.

To Mr. Fagg’s gracious alternatives,
we choose to neither accept his “chal-
lenge” to debate nor to fade into the
Twilight Zone. Instead, the editor
finds it necessary to maintain his pre-
vious course of action, that of com-
menting on the issues through the edi-
torial columns of THE DAVIDSON-
IAN as he was elected to do.

There is not, nor has there ever
been, any obligation on the part of
any newspaper editor to publicly de-
bate every issue on which he chooses
to comment—an editor is chosen as a
writer, not an orator. The precedent
of calling editors tn task on the de-
bate platform for every disagreement
would be absurd—if nothing else, it
would result in a monopoly of chapel
programs by disgruntled newspaper
readers.

No editor purports to be a qualified
expert on every issue confronting the
school, and the case at hand is no ex-
ception. If Mr Fagg considers himself,
speaking ‘‘on behalf of all_ dumb
jocks,” to be an expert, certainly he

can find someone of an equal expertise
who holds the opposing viewpoint. An
editor’s chief function is not so much
that of proposing final solutions as
that of stimulating debate on campus
which will present both sides and
eventually lead to some course of ac-
tion.

In declining Mr. Fagg's kind invita-
tion, we are by no means closing the
door to debate on the issue but instead
are advocating a different approach.
The editorial columns of THE DAVID-
SONIAN express the viewpoint of the
editor, while the letters-to-the-editor
column is available to any reader wish-
ing to comment on a particular issue.
No letter to the editor has ever failed,
to the knoweldge of the present staff,
to be printed in THE DAVIDSONIAN.

Mr. Fagg is welcome to take advan-
tage of this opportunity, as is any
other interested reader, within the
limits of reason and good taste.

Our correspondent comments that

“I have not attempted to resolve the -

issue. It cannot be done in a letter to
the editor.’ We wholeheartedly agree
but would go a step farther: Neither
can it be solved in a chapel debate. It
may take months or years to solve an
issue of such complexity and magni-
tude.

We hope THE DAVIDSONIAN will
play a significant part in the dialogue
over this important question.

Council Not Responsible The Gospel

For Unsuccesstul Parties

Dear Editor:

Once again it is time for the
Social Council to publicly
defend its program. The de-
fense is in regard to state-
ments from a DAVIDSONIAN
article concerning a ‘‘survey”
of the campus social pro-
gram. >

The results of the “survey”
were generally favorable al.
though I couldn't get too ex-
cited about, a survey of only
30 students. Nevertheless, I
would like to clear up a couple
of points concerning our pro-
gram.

Contrary to popular opinion,
the combo party ‘and square
dance combination of two
weeks ago was not a Social
Council event, but instead it
was sponsored by the Social
Committee of the Union head-
ed by Ben King. This commit-
tee has a budget of approxi-
mately $9000 for,the year and
is responsible for providing
social events on ‘‘off’ week-
ends. The Social Council
spends the remainder of the
$30,000 student social fee bud-
get on three concert weekends
and three major dance week.
ends. ‘

King's committee can be de-
fended for, that weekend that
“bombed” because. (1) a sim-
jlar weekend last year was
very successful; and (2) they,
like the Social Council, are
trying to satisfy all the enter.
tainment tastes of the campus.

Mr. Editor. if you had read
the article about the weekend
in question which appeared in
the October 7 issue of your
DAVIDSONIAN, you could
have noted that the weekend
was sponsored by the Union
and not the Social Council.
Then, perhaps, you would not
have criticized the Social

Y Not?
po

Council in your editoria] last
week for being over-ambi-
tious. But you have been
catching so much hell from
everybody else lately, that I
can sympathize with you for
your error. .

I personally feel that the
entertainment contracted by
the Social Council for first
semester plus the social
events as planned by the
Union committee provide
Davidson with the highest
quality social program ever
and thereby the Social Coun-
cil's fulfilling its obligation
to the student body.

Again, we ask for your sup-
port and welcome your’ sug-
gestions.

(Editor's note: THE DA-
VIDSONIAN apologizes for
its error in misappropriating
responsibility for the week-
end of Oct. 8 through funds
for the Union functions have
the same source as those of
the Social Council. The fact
remains that there exists the
danger of an over-planned
on.campus social life.)

Dear Editor:

Today I'd like to talk about
institutions. Institutions-can be
good things if they serve man’s
needs. Institutions can be bad
things if man must serve their
needs.

Davidson College has many
institutions. Some are good,
but others are bad.

MANUFACTURERS RULE NOW

‘Consumer Sovereignty’ Theory Attacked

Several
quietly checking the back of
my eyelids for holes on the
last row of an economics class
when I was suddenly jarred
into awareness by a student
in the front exclaiming some-
thing about the ‘‘sovereignty
of the consumer”’.

Apparently the class was dis.
cussing whether the goods be-
ing currently produced, in
spite of their efficient produc-
tion. are those goods which
ought to be produced from a
welfare point of view. This
Student claimed that those
goods which the individual con.
Sumer desires are the ones
that should be produced, that
this ipso facto is the proper
allocation of resources. and
that the consumer is sovereign
in our economy.

Well. of course. I was upset
about being awakened. but I
was also concerned about a
widely held belief which this
student revealed: that is. that
the consumer is sovereign. and
secondly that his needs and
desires are answered by our
production system.

This doctrine of consumer
sovereignty has had a long
history. In the days of do-
mestic production every item
which a person might desire
“was made in his own home, to
his own specifications, and he
initiated its production; this
was 100 per cent consumer
sovereignty.

weeks ago I was ~

Down. through the centuries
we have come a long way from
this position. The buyer first
gave up his authority to the
merchant who took orders and
tried to supply as closely to
the specifications desired as
possible, and then to the man-
ufacturers who now decide
what is to be produced and to
what specifications.

Of course, the manufacturer
is not absolute authority. and
the consumer's loss of initia-
tive involves no great loss of
authority as long as he is able
to choose from a broad range
of product. variations and is
able to recognize good design
and construction. However, as
production technology has ad-
vanced. these conditions have
decreased rather than increas-
ed.

Economics of scale not only
result in cheaper large-scale
production but also they raise
wages and diminish the profit-
ability of small scale produc-

tion at Davidson is chapel:
the speakers rarely serve the
needs of man. An example of
a good institution is open
house on Sunday nights: Man's
needs are served.

(Perhaps the reason open
house is being done away with
is that it is a voluntary insti-

tion is good if it is compul-
sory, bad if voluntary.)

A bad institution should be
reformed, a good one retain
ed. Open house should be re-
tained.

Objections to the current
system seem to be: 1!) The
professor's wife doesn’t know
how many people for whom to
prepare refreshments, 2) Stu-
dents will not attend under the
present system because the
abolition of vespers has made
attendance inconvenient, 3)
Under the present system, a
professor has to meet with stu-
dents who are not in his cours-
es.

My objections to the above
objections are as follows: 1)
Students don’t go to open
house to eat goodies (except
in a figurative sense), and a
professor's wife is not honor-
bound (or even duty-bound) to
prepare a feast, 2) For those
students who like to talk with
professors. Sunday night open
house even without vespers
makes no great inconvenience,
3) Any professor worth his salt
greatly appreciates any oppor-
tunity to expand his sphere of
influence, to mold the think-
ing of our young minds.

Having made my position
fearlessly clear on this contro.
versial issue, I await the in-
evitable refutation.

the extensive use of advertis-

According
To John Laie

tome’ whe’ selene an inats. A Fable: CONCLUSION

WHEN WE LEFT the story of Do-well Community
(DC) and Chris. Commit Mint some two weeks ago
we had reached the point where a serious crisis was
imminent. The problem revolved around whether or
not DC could achieve the heights it aspired to and
claimed while openly parading its relationship with

Chris.

Chris. Commit Mint was in severe straits. Al-
ready his control had been curbed by the non-resi-
dent board which dictates policy to DC. No longer
were members of the community required to attend
weekly meetings out of deference to Chris. Commit
Mint. The resident leaders of the Community weren't
expected to be so closely bound to the aims of Chris.
Commit Mint as they had been in the past. In short,
public evidence of the relationship between DC and

Chris. was negligible.

It should be pointed out that there was little op-
position voiced by Chris. in the course of all that hap-
pened. Evidently he approved many of the changes
which. occurred. In these enlightened times it had
been established beyond the shadow of a doubt that
Chris. certainly didn’t like to require his followers
to go to his meetings and swear to the very letter of
his philosophy. There is much about Chris. that is
difficult to understand, and he leaves most of the
problem of defining his relationships up to the com-

munities involv.d.

THE DILEMMA facing Chris. once again was
whether or not to quietly withdraw into the back-
ground and relinquish all his ties with DC as he had
jone in similar cases with other institutions. If only
he could hear a word of encouragement, anything

which might bolster his spirits and

give him. some

degree of hope. But all Chris. heard was the general
mutter of everyone about things that weren’t half his
age, things which, even though important in them-
selves, probably weren't even as fundamental to the .
well-being of DC as his own dilemma. In truth, DC
had to define its purpose with distinct reference to
Chris. or leave him out completely; it had to face

the problem.

The discouraging thing to Chris. was the indif-
ferent way in which he was treated. There were a
few who cared, but this minority couldn’t make itself
heard, and the majority of the residents of the com-
munity was not even aware that any problem ex-
isted, or if it. did evince an awareness it was not
grave enough to warrant action or thought.

r

MORE THAN ANYTHING else, Chris. wanted a
definite statement of just how DC felt about his pres-
ence in the community. He had done much for Do-
well, and Do-well had done well. And Do-well had
much to offer and great hopes for improvement in
the future. In a vague sort of way DC knew what

Chris. meant to it.

So DC kept ol’ Chris. around because of his good
name. Whenever Chris. got in the way he was pushed
aside, or the terms of the agreement with him were
redefined more liberally. In the end he saw what
even the people who lived and worked with DC had
failed to see; he saw that he had been turned out not
because of who he was and what he stood for but
simply because he had been forgotten.

DC came to a realization also. DC continued to
do well, but it was just like all the rest. Whereas
DC had once offered a unique opportunity, valued
by many and considered worthwhile throughout the’
country, without Chris, Commit Mint DC and its
members could only say: “best in the south; in search

of a new identity.”

Such practices as deceptive
designations of quality: the
“Deluxe Champion,’’ ‘Super
Deluxe Champion,’’ and ‘Su-
per Champion,” as first, sec-
ond and third-line tire desig-
nations (Consumer Report,
Oct., 1962), and fictitious price
designations listing a. $3-item
at $60, then announcing a
‘drastic’ price cut to $50,
contribute to this loss of faith.

Deceptive packaging to pre-
vent rational consumer cam-
parisons, built-in obsolescence,
and the oppressive volume and
questionable quality of the ads
also should be taken into con
sideration.

The social costs of the ad-
vertising effort in terms of
wasted material resources and
of uneconomic outlays for
credit, inventory and ware-
housing, insurance, product
display costs, packaging ma-
terials, trucks, retail plant ca
pacity, manpower, and so on,
are incalculable.

However, in all fairness, it
is necesssary to point out that
advertising like fire can be
used for good as well as bad:
there is nothing inherently
wrong with advertising. How-
ever, in the hands of manu
facturers seeking to sell a
large number of homogenous

products in order to maximize |

profits, its use may not tend
toward an optimum allocation
of resources in an overall wel.
fare sense and certainly does

eignty.

Advertising is neither good
nor bad but symptomatic of a
Situation, a situation of an
economy in which the consum-
er has little initiative and lit
tle authority. With advertising
the manufacturer seeks to

.form the market by inducing

a majority of the consumers
to buy a certain good. In our
economy there are very few
people who have unanswered
life or death economic needs:
hence the greater part of the
population, those with abso-
lute economic needs already
answered, are relatively indif-
ferent to what goods are avail-
able for sale.

In our economy those who
decide what will be produced
are those who are closest to
the centers of responsibility
and power. As Walter Lipp-
man said about political au-
thority, and it is undeniably
true with regard to economic
authorily, “There is an inner
circle, surrounded by concen-
tric circles which fade out
gradually into the disinterest-.
ed or uninterested rank and

In spite of cries of lost pre-
rogative and claims to the con-
trary based on irrelevant pure
competition assumptions, ‘the
essential fact remains that a
small number of heads pre-
sents a choice to a large
group.’
