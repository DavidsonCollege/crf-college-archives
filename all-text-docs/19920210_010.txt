College Relations

The Dutch vocal group
“Quink,” a quintet comfortable
with a repertoire ranging from
Renaissance madrigals tocontem-
porary music, will sing a Valen-
tine’s Day concert at Davidson
College on Friday, February 14.

The 8:15 p.m. Artists Series
performance will be held in Love
Auditorium of Chambers Build-
ing. Admission for those who do
not hold season tickets is $10 for
adults and $5 for students.

Quink debuted in 1978 at the
Holland Festival, and quickly
emerged as a unique professional
ensemble. The five singers, who
are also active as soloists, sing a
cappella songs representing five
centuries of music. They are regu-

larly invited to international music
festivals in Europe, and have re-
corded on the Etcetera and CBS
labels. Quink’s most recent com-
pact discs, on Telmarc, include a
collection of Italian Renaissance
madrigals, an offering of Christ-
mas carols and a CD of interna-
tional folk songs. They also re-
cently released a compact disc of
songs by Ralph Vaughn-Williams
and Gerald Finzi on the Fidelio
label. Fe
Quink’s first United States tour
was in 1985, and they have re-
turned twicea year ever since. Past
tours have included residencies at
Dartmouth and the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst. The
group comes from a combination
of three other words: “quint,”
meaning five people, “kwinkerl-

Blues Night Featuring Tinsley Ellis

By Chris Hoveland

Guitarist Tinsley Ellis played
atthe 900 Room lastmonday night
t> 150 responsive “blues-ers.”’
Songs such as the gut-wrenching
“Born in Georgia,” and the upbeat
“Deaf, Dumb, Crippled, and Blind”
proved that Ellis came to Davidson
with more than just a few licks up
his sleeve.

Tinsley Ellis has been called

“a bent note specialist whose style
recalls early Clapton and Stevie
Ray Vaughn,” and whose voice
“carries a warmth and melancholy
which greatly enriches his mate-

-_rial..” Others have noted that “he
“just might be ready toexplode onto

the national scene.”

Ellis played with the Atlanta-
based “Heartfixers,” recording four
albums with them before taking

“This will give majors a chance to
feel what it's like to be on their

own, outside of Davidson.” Stu-
dents will be granted this privilege
on a competitive basis.

The Arts Center was designed

of birds, and “kwinkslag,” a Dutch
word meaning a joke. The name
aptly fits their pure, sweet style
and its humorous moments. They
closed a performance last year with
Paul Patterson’s “Spare Parts,” a
bluesy take-off on the Franken-
stein story, and “Sag mir hnicht
‘adieu,’” an imitation of a 1930s
recording complete with staticand
skips.

Thecritics have not made jokes
about Quink. The New York Times
praised Quink’s' collection of
Benjamin Britten works, saying it
“reveals Quink’selegant phrasing,
impeccable intonation anda purity
of tonereminiscentof Renaissance
madrigals.”

off on his own. After heavy tour-
ing and two albums, Georgia Blue

and Fanning the Flames, the blues-

man has made quite a name for
himself in and outside of the South-
east. His albums prove his song-
writing talent, as well as his al-

ready famous guitar handling. He —

is known as a hard-working musi-
cian, touring more than 200 dates
per year.

by the Graham Gund Architects of

Cambridge, Massachusetts. The

exterior might
be described as
“contempo-
rary,” but the
architects, ac-
cording to
Jackson, were
restricted in
their design. A
college bro-
_  churestates that
| the building
will “effec-
tively comple-
ment the neo-
classical style
of the neighbor-
ing structures."
The interior of
the building, however, will cer-
tainly distinguish itself from oth-
ers on campus. Upon entering
from the east side (Main Street),

one will pass through the foyer and
enter the atrium. This spacious
room will be two floors high with
a glass ceiling, allowing sunlight
to enter.

The Development Office, with
cooperation from other offices and
Herb Jackson, has taken several
routes to fund the Visual Arts
Center. One plan is to raise money
through.an art auction. Auction
participants will pay $1000 to at-
tend, and proceeds will go toward
the construction costs. There are
also whatare called “commemora-
tive opportunities;” for instance,
the donor of $500,000 may choose
between having the painting stu-
dios, or the lecture auditorium, or
another room named after him or
her in recognition of their generos-
ity. The building will be named
after whoever donates $3 million.

‘Matt Bumstead —

Well, I bet you thought I’d
givenup! ‘Fraidnot. No, country
music is riding high and has a
firm grasp on America’s atten-
tion; and so I’ve still got a lot to
talk about. This semester, I’ll try
to bring up some more develop-
ments in and aspects of the coun-
try music world. We’ll get some
belated album reviews, maybe a
reader’s poll, and, we hope, some
more fun stuff.

1991 was a monolithic year
in Nashvegas. With Mr. Brooks
leading the way, record sales and
national attention to country art-
ists is at an unprecedented high.
As we begin 1992, many ques-
tions fill the minds of the industry
and its followers: will country
decline in popularity this year?
(Can the frenzy possibly esca-
late?) Can Garth Brooks con-
tinue to dominate the airwaves?
What’s next in country?

Women in Country —

With these questions in mind,
I thought it somewhat appropri-
ate to spend two weeks singling
out the biggest movers and shak-
ers in the country arena. This
week, I'll rank the top ten fe-
males; next week it’ ll be the guys’
turn. Now, this ranking system
is, of course, my very own pat-
ented formula; and rankings will |
be based on popularity, talent,
momentum, and personal prefer-
ence. I am simply ranking the
artists as I see them standing today
and in the near future. So, here
We go... .

can match her energetic, com-
manding presence. She is the
reigning champ, and she should |
