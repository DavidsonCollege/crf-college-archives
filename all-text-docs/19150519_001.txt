Annual Orater.

‘Lhe coming Commencement promises
indeed to be one of the most interesting
for several years. A number of new
teatures, such as the Academic Proces-
sion and Class Day Exercises. will serve
to add variety to the usual program.
Davidson has been especially tortunate
this year in the speakers that have been
secured fur the uccaston—Rev. R. Lb.
Leyburn, D.D., of Durham, N. C.,
pastor of the First Presbyterian Church
of Durham; Rev. B. F. Wilson, D.D., ot
Harrisonburg, Va., for many years Pres-
ident of Converse College. and Prof. S.
H. Edmunds, of Sumter, §. C., a well
knmewn alumnus of Davidson.

Instead of having the Annual Liter-
ary Address at 11:30 a. m., “Puesday, it
was decided to place the Seniur Orations
at this time and have the Annual Fater-
ary Address immediately before the
Graduating Exercises on Wednesda
morning. President Henry Louis Sith,
of Washington and Lee University, will
deliver this address, and it is verv fit-
ting that the one who will in a wav bid
farewell to the class of 1915 should ne
the one who gave it such a beartv wel-
come when it first came to Davidson as
a hand of “wee freshies.”

‘ Te is hoped that all of the classes will
make an attempt to have a representa-
tion at Commencement, and especiall-
the classes of .1880, 1800, 3895, 190%
1908, 1910 and 1914. As has becowe -
custom at Davidson.’ one of the dorm

tories will be set aside for the alumni +
that old classmates can be together a
much as possible. According to all re-
ports a number of relatives of the stu-
deres with a enndly number of “hes
girls” will he present. and the social side
af Commencement should be a great suc-
cess,

GRYPHON MEDAL AWARDED.

Frank W. Price has been awarded the
Gryphon medal, which is each year
given by the Order of the Gryphons to
the man in the Senior class who has ac-
complished most for the coflege during
the four years.

During his course Price has been a
constant worker in practically every de-
partment of college life. He bas been
President of the Y. M. C. A. during his
Senior year; Editor-in-chief of THe
Davipsonian: member of the Annual
Staff. and of the Magazine Staff; Chief
Marshall; Student Council member;

airman Debating Council; member of
the Inter-collegiate Debating Team. He
has alse received the Fiction Medal.
Junior-Serior Debater's Medal. and has
made the honor roll, averaging over 97

Coach Fetzer in an earnest speech out-
lined =the plans for next year. The
Alumni, as they are straining every
nerve to raise the required amount for
the new Gymnasium, will not be called
upon at all to help with the support af
athletics here. Fetzer suggested that
each class nevt: year raise in behalf of
athletics one hundred dollars. He went
on to sav what a great thing the Gym-
nasium would be to Davidson, that the
Alumni were doing a great work trying
to build it, and that it rested upon the
student body to take their place in the
support of athletics.

The following managers were also re-
cently elected: Base ball, R. G. Finley;
basket ball, R. W. McKay; assistant
foor ball, Reese and Hampton,

It was recommended and adopted that
all the letters be made of the same de-
sign, the only difference being in the
size—the foot ball to have the large D.
hase ball the smaller D, and basket ball
to have the smallese. D.
