By BILL DUBOSE

The long awaited week-end has
finally come around, and if every
thing goes as planned this should
be one of the best Homecomings
in the history of the school.

The festivities officially start to-

lotte Armory to the tune of Billy
Knauff and his band. As the Van-
Hellenic Council announced earlier
the Friday night dance will be
formal and will) last until 1:00
o'clock. All fraternity thouses may
remain open after the dance until
3:30 a. om. The Saturday night
dance is to-be presented in the ball-
room of “Hotel Charlotte. This
dance will be informal for both
boys and girls and will last from
8:00 to 12:00. All 11 fraternity
houses will have to close by 12:00
p.m. on that night.

We remember Billy Knauff as
having - presented music for the
1947. Spring Frolics. Many con-
sidered that set as the best of the
