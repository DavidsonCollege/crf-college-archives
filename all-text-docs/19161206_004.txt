Red and Black Machine
Made Excellent Record

A Brief Review of the Season, with
Newspaper Comments.

The 1916 football season has proved
the most successful that Davidson has
had in many years. “I‘he team has made
a wonderful showing. ‘The ‘opposing
teams have been almost without excep-
tion picked from student bodies much
larger than Davidson’s, and have repre-
sented the best colleges in the South.
By comparative scores the Davidson
team ranks among the first in the South
for the present season and no one will
gainsay that this honour has been a de-
served one. The Red and Black team
won five, lost three and tied one. “The
games lost were without exception very
close and the games won were without
exception clean cut and well deserved
victories.

While no credit for this splendid
showing should be taken from the indi-
vidual members of the squad, Coach
Fetzer’s name stands in the limelight,
and he should be given all praise for his
work with the Red and Black squad.
He is a coach to be proud of, and Dav-
idson is indeed fortunate in having such
a man to guide their athletic teams.

The extracts given below from the
leading Virginia, North Carolina and
Georgia papers give a fairly good esti-
mate of just what a great exhibition the
little Red and Black machine has put un
in football this season. Of the Virginia
same, which resulted in a t4-0 score in
favor of Virginia, the Richmond ‘Times-
Ditnatch has this to say:

“The Presbyterians presented a steady
team and during the entire second half
outplayed Goach Evans’ squad both on
offense and defense.”

Jack Black didn't get in this game un-
til the second half and several of the
Davidson men were not up to full stride.
Later games, especially the showing of
Davidson and Virginia against Carolina,
put a different light on the — relative
worth of the first two teams.

The Charlotte News has this to say
of the A. & M. battle: “Outplaying
their opponents at every stage of the
game, outguessing their offensive move-
ments and then in turn starting offens-
ives that at times seemed unstopped,
Davidson yesterday defeated A. & M.
in one of the fiercest football games ever
seen on Wearn field by a score of 16-0.”

The following extracts from Atlanta
give some estimate of the scare the Dav-
idson team threw into the Yellow Jack-
ets—Georgia Tech: “Not only did
Davidson bring practically every attack
of the Yellow Jackets to an abrupt halt,
but all the first half they had Heisman’s
men trembling for fear of their own
goal line.” “Tt must be confessed had
Strupper been out of the game, Tech’s
chances for a victory would have been
practically nil.”

“The game little crew from the Tar
Heel State

A game little gang is right.

The little Red team with the pep and
the steam,

And an inborn love for a fight.”

The team played a little below usual
form in the Citadel game, the  aeriel

game of the South Carolinians proving

a puzzle.

The following from the Roanoke
Times: ‘“Outclassing Roanoke College
at every stage of the game and uncover-
ing a mass of plavs that completely
dumfounded the Salemites, Davidson
triumphed over Roanoke by a score of
20 to 0.”

Davidson had an easy time with Fur-

man, piling up a score of 46 to 14.

News says: “When everything was
over and an adding machine or two was
brought into play, it was found that the
Presbyterians had tied the Tiger tail
into some thirty-three knots—and_ the
Davidson goal line was uncrossed. It
was in many respects a great game, but
the warriors from the Palmetto State
were outclassed from beginning to end.”

LAST SUNDAY’S SERMON.

Last Sunday Dr. Richards  appro-
priately took for his subject “Christ as
the Model Public Speaker,” with th:
text, ‘Never man spake as this man.”
Often, he said, we regard Christ only a
a spiritual leader, and forget how many
practical lessons we can learn from
Him. ‘Treating Christ as a speaker
from a personal rather than from a liter-
ary point of view, Dr. Richards went on
to show seven characteristic of His
speech. First comes His intellect and
His understanding of His subject mat-
ter both thru books and thru. nature:
second, His heart—capable both of love
for good and of hatred for evil: third.
His truthfulness, and fourth, His pur:
itv of life. Fifth was His interest ir
His subject that made Him earnest and
sincere; sixth, His personality—‘“a com
bination of heart and head,” and seventh
the presence of the Holy Spirit. ‘This
we are accustomed to look upon as be
longing to ministers alone, but in reality
its strength is available to every one of
us, and “if a man wants to have power
in public speaking, let him ask God's
Spirit.”

CIVIC LEAGUE NOTES.

The young ladies of the town hav:
used the funds realized from the “Old
Maid” entertainment given last summe
to put water in the Civic League hall.
‘They also added a burlap screen to mak :
the serving of refreshments more con
venient. The members of the Civi:
League warmly appreciate this interes
and help.

Miss Rode, representative of the
general manager's office of the Southern
Railway, has begun a scheme of plant-
ing at the railway station and has al-
ready put in quite a number of rare and
beautiful shrubs. This is expected to
add to the attractiveness of the depot
surroundings, and it is hoped that the
people of the community will show an
interest and aid the railroad in its ef-
forts to make and keep the station
grounds neat and attractive.
