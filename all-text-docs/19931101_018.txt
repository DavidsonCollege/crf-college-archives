THE DAVIDSONIAN

PREVIEW MONDAY, sie a 1, 1993

"We have very, very good shooters, as good as,
I think, anyone in the country. And of course a
strength would be our depth. We are two deep
and sometimes three deep [at each position]."
-Head Coach Bob McKillop

The Season Ahead
The Basketball Preview

Narat, Zimmerman, and experience
keys to this season's success.

By Rick Thurmond

Last season, the Wildcats were
picked to finish ninth in the South-
ern Conference. They shocked ev-
eryone but themselves by coming
in fifth, posting a 10-8 conference
mark to go along with an overall
14-14 record. This year, they were
picked fifth at the Southern Con-
ference Media Day. However, two
national publications have ranked
them fourth.

With two 1,000 point scorers
in Jason Zimmerman and Janko
Narat returning plus a talented and
experienced group of sophomores,
the Cats look to match last year’s
improvement.

Zimmerman and Narat lead a
crew of talented perimeter players
that Head Coach Bob McKillop
cites as one of the main strengths
ofthis year’s team. Zimmerman, a
6’2” senior from Warsaw, Indi-
ana, led the conference in three-
point shooting percentage (42%)
last season, scored 13.0 ppg, and
tied for the team lead in assists
with 4.8 ppg.

Narat is the leading returning
scorer with 13.4 ppg, pulled down
5.0 rpg, and led the conference in
free-throw shooting with a .867
mark. Both Zimmerman and Narat

have started together for three Janko Narat drives during a game last season.

years, over 75 games, and have
developed a chemistry that will be
essential to the team’s success.

In the paint

Questions, however, remain

down low. Graduation fairly deci- .

mated this area, leaving one expe-
rienced player in junior George
Spain. 7’0’’ Detlef Musch, last
year’s leading scorer and rebounder
is playing professionally in Ger-
many.

post defenderand consummate role
player, also graduated. Left behind

frame in that hole, with ample help
from 6’10” Sophomore Mark
McGwire. McKillop calls it “a
tossup” between those two for the
starting center job. He could also
go with a big lineup and apy them

Horton, in the midst of rehabilita-
tion from his third major knee sur-
gery, will also be counted on for
leadership down low if his recov-
ery is successful.

Versatility

Sophomore swingman Bran-
don Williams and Quinn Harwood
should provide quality minutes in
the paint as well. Tim Caldwell, a
6’8” junior, adds depth.

Williams and Harwood are a
part of a group of talented, athletic,
experienced, and versatile sopho-
mores that will see a lot of playing
time this year. Both can play three
positions, inside or outside.

Williams is an above average
shooter and rebounder who also
owns the team’s highest vertical
leap. He electrified the crowd sev-
eral times last year with his spec-
tacular open-court dunks.

Harwoodisa6’9” banger who
also possesses a good outside game.
Anderson and Babka round out the
group. Anderson will be counted
on to score as well as stop others
from doing so from both the off-
guard and small forward positions
while Babka brings his ball-han-
dling and shooting to any position
except center.

This versatility will figure
greatly in any success the Cats
couldhave this season. When asked
about the team strengths, McKillop
said, “No question about it, num-
ber one has to be our versatility.”

.The fact that McKillop can go
with a variety of lineups, big, small,

offensive, or defensive and have ~

confidence in each will make the
team extremely difficult to defend.
Preview in Europe

The team had achance to dem-
onstrate this versatility as.well as
add valuable experience this sum-
mer with a trip to Italy. The Wild-
cats played six games in six days
against foreign league professional
teams, with players that McKillop
called “very physical, very com-
petitive, basically men.” The ex-
perience was especially valuable
in the backcourt.

Due to the fact that
Zimmerman was unable to play
due to a stress fracture, (he is fully
recovered now) McKillop was
forced to try other players at the
guard spots. McKillop mentioned

- Babka as perhaps the most pleas-

ee

ant surprise with his play at point
guard.

On a more general level, the
European trip was an invaluable
opportunity for the team because it
helped to develop “the sense of ©
team chemistry” that McKillop
calls the numbertwoteam strength.

Finally, the coaches got a
chance to do something that no
other Southern Conference team
could do.

They were able to preview
this year’s version of the Cats be-
fore the official beginning of prac-
tice on Saturday, October 30. This
should prove to be an edge over
other teams who have not had a
chance to play together under
coach’s supervision until this past
weekend, due to NCAA regula-
tions.

Rough schedule

This head start and experi-
ence will be needed to survive a
tough early schedule. Three of the
first eight games are against ACC
teams Wake Forest, Clemson, and
North Carolina State. Wake Forest
and North Carolina State are away
games and the Clemson game will
be played in Charlotte Coliseum.

In addition, the Wildcats host
UNC-Charlotte and travel to Hun-
tington, WV to play the Thunder-
ing Herd of Marshall, picked to
contend for the Southern Confer-
ence crown.

January should also prove to
be a challenging month, with a
stretch of five out of six confer-
ence games on the road. The Cats,
though, should be able to finish
strong with three straight home
conference games before the tour-
nament in the Asheville Civic Cen-
ter. A tournament championship,
then, would mean an automatic bid
to the big dance, the NCAA Tour-
nament.

McKillop’s group nearly made
it to the finals of the tournament,
anda possible NCAA bid, last year.
With Zimmerman and Narat lead-
ing the versatile group of sopho-
mores, this year’s Cats seem ca-
pable of even more.

If either McGwire or Spain
can step up down low and the pe-
rimeter shooting becomes as dam-
aging a weapon as it can be, look
for the Davidson Wildcats to make
some noise this year in their sec-
ond year in the Southern Confer-

_ ence.
