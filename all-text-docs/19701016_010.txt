ANALYSIS
By JOHN FINE
Staff Writer

Four men from different
walks of life were featured
in a leadership symposium
Tuesday, sponsored by the
ROTC department.

But from all indications,
their performance on stage
rather showed how not to
lead.

The Davidson College
Alumni Association last week
elected two young men to
key positions.

John M. Trask Jr., 758,
was elected to the board of
trustees, and W. Harrison
Wellford, ’62, was elected
vice president of the alumni
association.

Trask, one of .the two
youngest members of the
board, was chosen to serve
a four-year term. He _ re-
cently "tompleted a one-year
term as president of the
alumni association.

Wellford is currently ex-
ecutive vice president of the
Center for Study of Respon-
sive Law, popularly known
as .‘‘Nader's Raiders.”

Director of Alumni Affairs

Howard A. Arbuckle cited
Trask and Wellford as ex-
amples of younger men who
have succeeded in breaking
the age barrier on the board
and in the alumni associa-
tion. ‘
He said it is hard for
young men to be elected be-
cause so many older men of-
candi-
dates.

The alumni association al-
so chose three other men to
fill spots on the board.

J. Dickson Phillips Jr.,
dean of the University of
North Carolina~ law school
and vice president of the
trustees, was reelected to a
second four-year term.

year term- wks Hubert N.

them a role in the decision-

The goal of leadership is
to create a system in which
all men can develop their
potentialities, Patterson said.
