That uncertain team from Wake
Forest will be Davidson’s opponents
on the 16th. It is certain that the
first game in Charlotte is to be a
fight from the start and that the
teams are quite evenly matched.
Both squads have been over rather
rough roads for the past three
weeks. Their schedules called for
their larger foes to fall three in a
row and each had about the same
reception.

Carolina was about evenly played
by Wake Forest in their game, while
Davidson was having a little pas-
time with Washington and Lec. The
same score of 6-0 was made in the
two struggles. As to comparative
scores there is little to choose. In
the Tech results Wake Forest has
the edge, but in those of W. & L.
our team seems to be the better.

Demonstration has shown that
Davidson's line is there with the
goods and that the backfield will
deliver the goods when unhampered.
If in condition and are permitted to
play they can wade through. Moore,
Poe and Cassell were sadly missing
among the hacks Saturday, while
Schenck might have helped in the
defence. The combination complete
has the hopes of Davidson certain-
ly, but further, it has all of their
confidence. .

Robenhorst is undoubtedly the
outstanding star for Wake Forest.
He was unable to play against W. &
L., but must be counted on for ex-
cellent work against the Wildcats.
