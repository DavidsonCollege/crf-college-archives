A Serise Of Purpose?
Add It To Your Schedule.

Thousands of Army ROTC graduates, from
_ hundreds of college campuses, have be-
come leaders in our country’s volunteer

Army.

Some enrolied in ROTC for financial aid

to complete college (nearly $2500 during

. their junior and senior years). Others for
the management training and experience
offered by Army ROTC courses. Still others
for the positions of immediate leadership
responsibility following graduation, as offi-
cers in the active Army, Reserves, and Army

National Guard.

_. But most enrolled also to serve their
country. Men and women from the north,
the east, the south, the west . . . from small
rural communities and large urban areas.

They've shown that you don’t have to be
from Tennessee to be a volunteer, or from
Texas to stand tall for your country.
