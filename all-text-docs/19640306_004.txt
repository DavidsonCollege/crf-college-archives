Humphrey First
For LBJ Running

BY CHARLES RAMBERG

“ Lyndon Johnson is a snake in the weeds and will be forced to prove himself one
‘many times before November,” wrote a seasoned observer of Georgia politics recently.
Just how many rattles Southern voters can discern on the Democratic

dential candidate will be one of many factors Johnson

considers in August before! 5) on winrRED P. MINTER

he names his choice for running-mate.

At this writing, the Democrats

have nearly as many contenders

for second place on the Johnson
ticket as the Republicans have

for the first spot. They include

California Governor Pat Brown,
Minnesota Senators Hubert
Humphrey and Eugene McCar.
thy, Attorney General Robert
Kennedy, Peace Corps director
Sargent Shriver, U.N. asbassa-
dor Adlai Stevenson and New
York City mayor Robert Wag-
ner. I shall consider only Hum.
phrey, Stevenson, Shriver and
Kennedy.

Accenting interest in the race
for the Democratic Vice Presi-
dential nomination this year are
a number of factors, not the least
of which is the president's
health. In this election year.
American voters will be more
aware than ever that a presi-
dent's term can end suddenly.
They will recall Johnson’s 1955
heart attack and probably favor
a young running mate.
“Johnson will choose his run-
ning mate in late August at At-
lantic City, N. J.. a month after
the G.O.P. convention in San:
Francisco. Undoubtedly the geo-
graphical base and political po-
sitions of the Republican chal-
lenger will play a Jarge part in
his decision. So far. the major
contenders for the Democrats’
second spot are from the party's:
liberal wing and (with the ex-
ception of Brown) from North-
ern states.

Theodore H. White has chaf-
acterized the ‘60 election as a
Southern revolt. This year Nixon
captured Virginia’s and Flor-
ida’s electoral votes and im-
proved on Eisenhower's inroads
into Democratic pluralities in Al}-
abama. Georgia, Mississippi and
South Carolina. John. Kennedy
captured only 52.9 per cent of
the popular vote in the once Sol-
id South.

Most of the credit for that
majority went to Lyndon John-
son, who had captured all but
18% of the 267 votes eight of
the ten Old South states
brought fo the Democratic
Convention.

Now Johnson must contend
with an image that Southern vot-
ers find tarnished by his support
of civil rights legislation. yet he
needs both their support and that
of the liberally-oriented North-
ern urban electorate.

Finally, Johnson may want to
put a Catholic on the ticket.
Shriver and Kennedy both qual-
ify.

R. Sargent Shriver, 48, has re-
cently been the object of the
most attention in the race for
‘second spot on the Democratic
‘ticket. The boomlet can be trac-
ed to Jan. 6, when Johnson stat-
ed that he regards Shriver as
“‘one of the most brilliant most
able and most competent offi-
clals in the Government, I re-
gard him as my real confidant,”
Johnson concluded.

As much of Shriver’s appeal
can be traced to what he is as
to what he has done. He took
over the fledgling Peace Corps
in 1961 soon after resigning as

tial nominee.

“TI can't say this (the Vice
Presidency) is a burning am-
bition with me.’’ Stevenson told
an AP reporter soon after the
poll. He said he would take the
nomination if Johnson offered it
to him, however, leaving him a
lukewarm candidate for the job.

Stevenson supporters must
take into account this unenthu-
slastic attitude as well as the
age of the candidate (64), the
fact that he has been twice
vanquished while bearing the
party’s standard, and the un-
favorable outgrowths of his
otherwise prestigous career as
U.N. envoy.

He is known to support the ad-
mission of the Red Chinese to the
U.N. on the ground that there
they could be held accountable
for their acts. Further, he has

been whitewashed by Barry
Goldwater, who says that Ste-
yenson has. “consistently urged
a soft policy toward Commu-
nism, both in Cuba and else-
where in the world.”

Robert F. Kennedy. 38. rated
second choice by the county
chairmen, is no newcomer to
politics. He managed his broth-
er’s presidential campaign in ‘60,
which would give him double
value as a Johnston running
mate. Not only could he contrib-
ute all his political acumen. but
he could also draw, on all the
close ties he built up and has
maintained with political lead-
ers, particularly in the vital
North and East.

Kennedy appeals to many vot-
ing blocs, He is both young and
a Catholic. His record as Attor-
ney General should garner for
the Democrats any Negro votes
they missed in 1960. And he has
the magic of the Kennedy name.
as well as the confidence of the
president, who sent him on a

_tnission to Southeast Asia as his

personal envoy.

One major debit can be cited
against Robert Kennedy (He
cannot be charged politically in-
adept after masterminding the
winning candidate’s campaign in
*60), and that black mark may
be enough to blot out much of
his worth as a Northeastern bal-
ance to Southwesterner Johnson.

Southern politicians fresly

predict that the name Robert

Kennedy on the Democratic

ticket in 196¢ would be enough
to turn the South over to the
Republicans. While these
claims can be disputed, it
seems a real possibility that
Johnson might sacrifice the
South’s unloved “Bobby” to
placate Dixie sensibilities.

In Kennedy's place he could
easily substitute Senator Hubert
Horatio Humphrey, who has the
same liberal-pleasing views but

is not tainted by a record of in-
tervention into the way the South
chooses to deal with its Negroes.

Minnesotan Humphrey, 52. has
overcome an earlier reputation
as a ‘‘far-out” liberal to become
the favorite Vice Presidential
nominee for the Democratic
county chairmen. He is still a
liberal’s liberal. however, and in
addition is a skilled politician.
Finally, he wants to be Vice
President.

In 1947 he was co-founder of
the Americans for Democratic
Action. A year later at the Dem-

ocratic Convention he invited his
fellow party members to “get
out of the shadow of states’
rights and walk forthrightll in
the bright sunshine of human
rights.” This led to a walkout
of several Southern delegations
and formation of the States’
Rights Party.

His liberal voting record on
civil rights, medical care, fed-
eral ald to education and ur-
ban renewal has endeared him
to large masses of voters in
the large Northern cities, the
Negro voter, and organized te-
bor. And yet he is not the an-
athema to the South that Rob-
ert Kennedy is.

And Humphrey wants the sec-
ond spot on the ticket. On Jan.
2 he said that to run for the Vice
Presidency would be a ‘‘singu-
lar honor.’’ Soon thereafter, U.
S. News & World Report stated
that Humphrey was running as
hard as he could for the nomi-
nation.

Many ifs remains to be deter-
mined. Who will be the G.O.P.
choice to oppose Johnson? What
will the public opinion polls say
about the Johnson image in the
South and Northeast in August?
Only when these and many oth-
er factors are decided will Lyn-
don Johnson end the specula-
tion and name his choice for
running mate.

Rockefeller

Recently I saw and heard Nel-
son Rockefeller explain to a
television audience why he liked
some of the avant-garde paint-
ings which he collects and which
adorn. the Governor’s mansion
in Albany. It was, to me, a most
impressive performance for a
man desiring to be President of
the United States. As I recall, he
spoke in terms of the non-rep-
resentational character of some
of the contemporary art which
he likes.

The North Carolina gu-
bernatorial primary cam-
paign is beginning to pick
up some steam, but it’s too
early for the main fire-
works. With more than
three months to go until
May 30, the Democratic can-
didates are already in the
field busy in the grassroots
all the way from Murphy to
Manteo pumping hands,
making speeches, and gen-
erally apple-polishing the
electorate.

With three candidates in the
race, the probability of a run-
off primary after the May 30
election is introduced. The elec-
tion laws require a majority of
the total votes cast to be for one
candidate in order to avoid the

IDSONIAN

possibility of a second, or run-
off primary. The man with the
second highest plurality in the
event of no majority can force
a primary with his higher op-
ponent if he so chooses.

The only previous campaigner
among the three is I. Beverly
Lake, the Wake Forest law pro-
fessor who ran in 1960. being
defeated in the run off primary
by Terry Sanford. Lake polied
181.000 votes out of the total of
653,000 cast in the three-way
first primary, and garnered
275.080 of 628,000 in the second
primary. So it is estimated that
he starts in the present situation
with from 175,000 to 200.600 cer-
tain votes which he is striving
to boost to a majority.

In order to do this, Lake must
play down the race theme in
line with the prevailing moder-
ate sentiment on the subject a-
mong the majority of people in

fa 1960, Nixon proved tiim-
self inadequate to the task of
running a nafional campaign.

His chief shortcomings prob-
ably tay Im his tack of cotor
and tack of faith in his staff.
The fatter resulted in a poor-
fy-coordinated, poorly-concelv-
ed campaign. After having
been In the public limelight
for over a decade he found
a fairly easy road to the White
House awaiting him.

But instead of walking away
with the election, Nixon—to the
surprise of everyone—went on
the defense. His close associa-
tion with the Eisenhower ad-
ministration seemed at times
to be more of an albatross than
an asset. In the 1960 election at
least. this should not have been
so.

In an effort to keep alive his
political career, he returned to
California after his defeat to run
for governor against incumbent
Pat Brown. Nixon's campaign
in California showed most of the
faults of his 1960 outing. Ironic-
ally, one of the factors in his loss
to Brown was the Kennedy han-
dling of the situation in Cuba—
Teminescent of Korea and Nix-,
on's "49 Senate election.

Following the defeat Nixon
held his infamous ‘‘final"’ press
conference in which he claimed
he had been “given the shaft”
by the press. Among his closing!
remarks he noted, ‘‘Just think |
how much you're going to be
missing—you don’t have Nixon
to- kick around any more.”

done since his defeat in Cali-
fornia was to play the piano on
the Jack Parr Show. He noted
at that time that he and Parr
had similar problems with press
relations.

Realistically, when the conven-
tion delegates assemble in Chi-
cago in July, Nixon will hold lit-
tle. if any, first ballot strength.
The stage will belong. as it does
now, to Governor Rockefeller,
Senator Goldwater. Governor
Scranton, and a multitude of “fa-
vorite sons.”* It is unlikely, how-
ever, that either of the front run-
ners will have the necessary del-
egate strength.

In turning to Nixon, the con-
vention would find a proven vote-
getter in national elections and
a man well-known to the Amer-
ican public. IT do not feel they
will turn their undivided atten-
tion to Nixon. I feel he will go
the way of Senator Taft in the
‘52 convention in a similar situa-
tion.

If a dark horse is waiting in
the wings. he will likely stay
there.in what appears to be a
Democratic year. It would re-
quire, I believe, the capitulation
of Rockefeller and Scranton to
push Nixon into a spot on the
°64 Republickan ticket. In such
a case, Richard Milhouse Nixon
could well have his chance to
lose his-third election in 4 years.

The third charge brought a-

that he tries to be “‘all things to

‘ample usually cited is that he
wishes to be known as a South-
erner, and yet he supports Civil
Rights legislation. More on that
later. but the following is how
Johnson once described himself:

the state. He stresses ‘‘sensible”
conservatism with an emphasis
on preserving the ‘American
way of life’ against “creeping
socialism” and fiscal irresponsi-
bility. He emphasizes a “‘busi-
ness-like”’ type of concern for
the problems of the state. His
main support comes from the
eastern counties.

L. Richardson Preyer,
Greensboro lawyer and former
federal judge, is new at the
game of politics. Bu? he has
been given the opportunity to
bring together again in his
behalf the organization that
elected Terry Senford. He has
the blessing of many in the
more progressive wing of the
state democratic party. His
task is to make himself widely

peal. He has set himself vigor-
ously to these objectives and
has promised to visit every

Dan K. Moore, from Canton ir
the mountains of western Caro-
lina, has the backing of the more
conservative wing of the demo-
cratic party which was more or

PREYER

less dissatisfied with the extrem-
ism: of Lake's tactics and meth-
ods in the 1960 campaign. Less
emphasis will be placed on race
questions by Moore and more at-
tention given to economic con-
servatism.

Up until now Moore appears to
be delivering his major salvos
against Preyer as the Lake sup-
porters are solidly loyal and

them Richard Russell of Geor-
gia, present leader of the fight
against Civil Rights legislation.

And yet the first meaningful

civil-rights bill since the Civil
War was passed by the Senate
when Johnson was majority
leader. Consistently he backed
civil rights as Vice-President,
and he has continued to do so as
President.

How car thet be? A possible
explanation might be that the
section of Texas Johnson lives
in is not so much a part of the
South as It is of the West.
There Is not any considerable
number ef Negroes in John-
son’s part of Texes, and thus
he does net have the inbred
Southern attitudes on race of
Russell.

A more plausible explanation
might be that during his several
years in federal government
(since 1937) Johnson's outlook
has broadened considerably. Re-
cently he said the following con-
cerning civil rights:

“Unless we are willing to yield
up our destiny of greatness a-
mong the civilizations of history,
Americans—white and Negro to-
gether—must be about the busi-
ness of resolving the challenge
which confronts us now. Until
justice is blind to color, until
education is unaware of race,
until opportunity. is unconcerned
with the color of men’s skins,
emancipation will be a procla-
mation but not a fact.”

In conclusion, Johnson's rec-

ord so far has been impressive!

Preyer's mobilization efforts can
be impeded. Preyer is accused
of having secret meetings with
Canford and of making ‘‘deals’’
with the “organization.” Also,
Moore says that he is afraid to
face the race question and will
not meet with Negro groups:
that he is a political novice: and
that he is a ‘‘muddled” Hberal.

Preyer concentrates on more
constructive proposals. He labels
his program as the ‘‘cycle of
hope’’ and pushes it in his whirl-
wind type of campaigning. He
adsorbs and refuses to answer
most of the attacks of Moore
because he believes that Lake
will be his most likely opponent
in the run-off primary and he
will need to appeal to former
Moore supporters then and thus
doesn't want to antagonize them

nesses, Lake points eut, is that

tions, and is like Preyer fn

In the field of foreign aid, the
Senator feels that such aid
should not go to those countries
whose policies are consistently
unfriendly to our own; aid to
friendly nations should be, gen-
erally, limited to military and
technieal assistance in the West-
ern defense against Commun

holds clear-cut views on domes-
tic issues:

Despite the welter of talk, few
solid issues have emerged. All
the candidates agree on the gen-
eral needs of the state, such as
more industry, better, education,
tebacco research to avert a
crisis in that central sector of
the economy, more roads, hospi-
tals. Each candidate would like
to pin a race label, such as
“segregationist’ or ‘“‘integra-
tionist’’ on the others while re-
maining as non-committal on the
subject as possible himself.

MOORE

In general, it appears that
Preyer has the most suitable
qualifications for the governor-
ship. He has conducted his cam-
paigns on an ethical plane with
more concentration on positive
policies rather than on person-
alities. His proposals suggest
more careful thought and indi-
cate a basic ability and compe-
tence than is true of the other
candidates.

AS an exampie, Moore's
blanket proposal for a ten per
cent raise for state employees
seems to be a popularity-seeking
device: while Lake's suggestion
that a four lane highway be built
to ‘connect the mountains with
the seacoast’’ ignores the exist-
ence of a good road network al-
ready which needs constant im-
provement, but not a new road
of this type for that purpose.

®@ Senator Goldwater favors

engaged in commercial activities

ices. Being exempt from normal
taxation. TVA can underbid
competition: the net effect is a
continuing subsidy for the privi-
leged few by the many. Sale of
these facilities would end this
economic imbalance. and show
a net economic gain to the na-
tion as these enterprises shifted
to efficient, non-bureaucratic
operation by taxpaying corpora-
dons.

seeks to meke it a fegal of-
fense for an individual, in the

@ Senator Goldwater, if elect-
ed President, would attempt to
have Social Security reorgan-
ized along the lines of the volun-
tary plan now covering profes-
sionals and small businessmen:
he objects to the totally cen-
tralized and compulsory system
now in existence. and believes it
could be more efficiently run
by private, local, and state func-
tions. The senator also opposes
the proposed Medicare plan on
essentially the same grounds, in-
cluding the fact that a success-
fu) plan (Kerr-Mills) is already
in existence.

This, in brief, is Senator Gold-
water’s stand on the major is-
sues. It is my belief that his
views are shared, at least in
part, by the greater portion of
the American people, who are,
at heart, basically conservative.

Goldwater’s popularity ~ with
the electorate of the West, Mid-
west, and South, along with the
“rising groundswell of conserva-
tism” in this nation, will make.
him a tough opponent for Lyn-
don Johnson, who will find it
difficult to hold together the
shaky coalition of minority
groups that elected the late
President Kennedy in 1960.
