‘The Reivers’ Embodies
The Best U.S. Film Art

A REVIEW
By DON HOYT

Fashionalte Americans
hold tenaciously to two un-
fortunate beliefs: 1) the only
good film is a European film,
and 2) any film from Czecho-
slovakia is, simply by being
Czech, great. Even establish-
ed critics contradict these
firmly entrenched — theories
only when prepared for mor-
tal combat, and then with
fear and trembling.

In times of the “new,”
the “daring,” and the “‘un-
usual,"’ critics are frequently
cowed into silence; for the
‘creators of the bad and the
“indifferent never tire of point-
ing out that Beethoven,
‘Tschaikovsky, and all of the
‘Impressionists were excoriat-
ed in their time by ignorant
men who did not understand
what they heard and saw.

There is something wrong
with this situation the
audience is expected to com-

municate with the artist,
rather than the artist with
the audience.

When, after attempting to
enter into the spirit of ‘*Mar-
tyrs of Love’ and ‘‘Appren-
ticeship,"’ attempting to ap-
preciate them on their own
terms, we still find them ter-
rible, we should not hesitate
to pronounce them unadulter
ated Czechoslovakian ordure.

These two films, from this
Week's New Line Cinema
program, deal devastating
blows to the idea of unfailing
Czech magnificence © since
both are Czech and both are
excruciatingly bad. What
more can be said?

“The Reivers’ should kill
for once and for all the be-
lief in a European monopoly
of cinematic excellence. For
“The Reivers” is: American,
in everything from Steve
McQueen's “Imagine me, a
white man, having to drive
a nigger all the way to Mem-
phis!"’ to the score, which
combines the best of Aaron
Copland, Flatt and Scruggs,
and Dixieland.

If the producers of ‘The
Reivers’’ wanted to- be crass
they, could advertise their
film with the slogan; ‘Three
men went in search of
America, and found it right
where it had always been.”

Indeed, ‘‘The Reivers’’ has
its foundation in traditional
American pieties. Boss, the

are sometimes afraid to sleep,
by yourself, Don't’be; trust in
the Lord He's up all

night.”

» Lucius, however, falls un-
der the spell of Boon Hogen-
beck (played by McQueen),
who knows that “the rewards
of virtue, which are cold,
odorless, and tasteless, are
not to be compared with the
bright and exciting pleasures
of sin and wrongdoing.’

They set off in Boss’ new
automobile, a 1904 Winton
Flyer, toward Memphis and,
eventually, the most stunn-
ing horse race sequence in
film. history.

These 85 seconds, which
are the climax of the movie,
give us a close-up in time;
we see the play of the horses’
muscles as they gallop around
the track seeming for. all
the world like dancers in an
exquisitely choreographed
ballet. We feel the joy and ex-
ultation of the riders as they
glory in their exertion - and
the whole is captured forever
in a timeless world.

A great deal of the credit
for “The Reivers’’ goes to”
Faulkner for originating the
story, and to Irving Ravetch
for adapting Faulkner to the

screen, but the greatest
praise must be reserved’ for
Mark Rydéll, who ‘did an

expert job of directing, and
Rupert Grosse, who played
Ned an outrageously fun-
ny character -.and,; at the
same time, that cinematic
rarity: a black man with the
human warmth that makes
him more than just black..

“fhe Reivers” is a ‘ pro-
duct of perfectly co-ordinated
acting and direction, photog-
raphy and “editing, screen
writing and composing. It ex-
emplifies the best of Ameri-
can film-making, and our
best is not to be surpassed.

Salyer pointed out that a

broad spectrum. of opinion
will be represented in the
symposium,

“Although I would be hes-
itant to type our visitors,”
he said, “‘I*’ would say that
their positions range from
‘liberal’ to ‘traditional.’ The
presence of two. students,
Dave Sweatt and Joe Kil
patrick, on the program will
also add to the range of
opinion presented,’

“The format of the
posium will be rather infor-
emal,’’ Salyer~ noted, ‘‘The
programs on both evenings
will begin with talks by the
participants, most of which
will be given from notes

“This tormat. offers the

very important topic; I hope
they will take full advantage
of it.”

Salyer noted that the Union

of revenue for the sympos-
ium, other sources being the

and the. college's speaker

that change is inevitable and
that change should be con-

toward favorable rather than
unfavorable results.”'

It plans to work through
existing town agencies, and
to “avail itself of existing
plans and studies.”

No authority is held by the
group, as such, according
to Spencer, but it does “have
the approval of the Town
Council to make its studies
and submit proposals to the
various agencies in the town

government and the town
Planning Board.

‘Talking has been the
main thing, up to now,”
Spencer added. “The next
step is to have a_/ serious
study by competent people

who can tell us about the
economics of the . situation,
the type of development that
might be possible, and that
sort of thing. The committee

has been in touch with a.num- ”

ber of companies who might
make this feasability study.”’

“The basic idea is that the

community is certain to grow

and we must therefore plan
for this change;
entering into it unprepared.”’

Alumnus Seigler Examines
ForeignDevelopmentPolicy

By STEVE ROADY
Staff Writer

Bill Seigler,
son graduate
tending the John Hopkins
School for Advanced Inter-
national Studies, has recently
helped to create the Youth
Task Force for Internation-
al Development.

a 1968 David-
presently at-

The Youth Task Force was

formed by a group of stu-
dents in the Washington
area who are concerned

about the present trends in
United States development
policies, which they think
are leading to a sort of  iso-
lationism,

Co-chairman Seigler sees
the Task Force as a parallel
to the Presidentially created
Peterson Task Force on In-
ternational Development,

a losing proposition.

Not wealthy, but not suf-
fering ‘from the lack of bus:

tion of students, and that’s
what they were hoping to
find here in the first place.

which is scheduled to report
to thé President in March

Stating that ‘“‘much of the
young people's talent teday
is being directed inward,
and we'd like to direct it
outward,’ Seigler’ cited’ sev-
eral goals for the -Task
Force: First, to stimulate in-
terest among young people
in development; Second, to
provide an avenue through
which they can voice their
concern; Third, to become a
factor in United States. de-
velopment policy-making. :

The Youth Task Force is
pursuing two courses of ac-
tion in attempting to reach
its’ goals. The students in
Washington who make up the
core of the Task Force are
conducting an intensive study
of United States development
policies, and interested stu-
dents ftom across the nation
have been asked to submit
essays on a number of select-
ed development topics.

The authors of at least
fifty of the best essays will
be invited to~Washingtéhi to

partigipate in~ the™ Interna-
tional Development Confer-
ence to be held February
24-26.

Seigler says that the Task
Force has received the en-
thusiastic support of many

in the Agency for Interna-

tional Development’ (AID),
as well as from Robert Mc-
Namara, present head of the
World Bank, Senators Javits,
McGovern, ahd Ribicoff, and
numerous Congressmen,

He is quite hopeful that the
recommendations made by
the Task Force will be in-
corporated into future United
States international develop-
ment planning.
