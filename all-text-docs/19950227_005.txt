Dougherty starts PET for “

By ASHLYN DANNELLY

Senior Hal Dougherty works
at a drug education center in Char-
lotte, where he sees effective peer
education programs at work. Those
programs encouraged Dougherty

. to start the Davidson College Peer
Education Team, which will tackle
a variety of issues ranging. from
substance abuse to HIV education.

In a recent meeting attended
by students, faculty, and staff,
Dougherty outlined his ideas con-
Cerning the program. He hopes the
team will use word of mouth to
spread “educated gossip.”

He says, “When Muffy gets a
new Saab, the whole campus knows
within three days. But, when Muffy
feels like her roommate has a drink-
ing problem, what are the steps
Muffy needs to know? My pointis
that Muffy knows she could prob-
ably go to the Counseling Center.
But how can Muffy learn to com-
municate with this person while
taking care of herself? Wouldn’ tit
be great if Muffy could be able to
approach a friend about the issue

-and know that friend could give
her practical advice? This infor-

mation needs to become the new
form of gossip.”

Dougherty sees peer educa-
tion as “innovative. It is the mod-
ern, effective way of spreading
educational information. Itis used
by some of the foremost universi-
ties across the nation.”

Dougherty realizes that other
sources of information are avail-
able on campus through various
organizations., But, he says, “this
program will augment the efforts
of PE 101 and all the other student
programs. Most student efforts
focus on a specific issue and a
specific group. PET will work on
many issues and cater to everyone
... you listen to your co-worker or
your friend and take it to heart
more than you would with a formal
speaker. The issue becomes more
personal.”

Dougherty hopes that the edu-
cation effort will benefit students,
faculty, and staff alike. He aims to
have representation from all those
groups.

The team would participate in
a monthly training session on a
specific issue. As a result of the
training sessions, team members
would be armed with useful, perti-

nent information to pass along to
their peers.

Dougherty says, “I want
people to walk away with maybe
five practical pieces of informa-
tion and two sources of referral,
not just facts and figures ... for
instance, people should know that
if they are going to have unpro-
tected oral sex, they should not
brush their teeth before and should
not swallow, thus reducing the risk
of HIV infection. We don’t have
the medium to get information like
that out. We need people who can
say stuff like that.”

Dougherty was pleased by the
response to the meeting. He says,
“I wanted to approach a group of
people with the idea and see if it
was something they would find
interesting ... I felt encouraged that
there was enough interest to pro-
voke questions.”

But organizing the group is a
daunting task. This semester the
group will work primarily with
organization issues, and training
sessions will begin in the fall.
Dougherty says, “Now that there is
demonstrated interest, we have to
work on structure, statement of
purpose, possibly modeling our

resources together, and to work
together with other departments of

the college to better utilize the funds_

and resources that are available.”
During this process, Mr. Brantley
says that “Part of the review in-
cluded a review of the positions
within the Physical Plant. It was
concluded that the Physical Plant
could work without those posi-
tions.”

Collins said that some posi-
tions were eliminated because he
realized that people were not work-
ing full time with their skills. To
accommodate this, Collins decided
to hire people out on a contracting
basis instead of having full time
positions. He says that this is a
process that any contracting busi-
ness has to go through.

Collins said that the operating
budget of the Physical Plant is go-
ing to remain the same for next

year.
changes. He said that the cost of
supplies and materials is “higher
than the Consumer Price Index”
and these are costs that must be
met. Collins says, “More money

had been going to the personnel
area [of the Physical Plant] in the

last couple of years,” and he had to

shift more money for supplies and
materials.

The anonymous source says,
“We always felt job security to be
good at the college. We never
expected a layoff. People are still
a little scared here. The whole
aspect of our jobs has changed.
We are doing things differently
here now than we were last week.”
The source also says that “Mr
Collins hinted that more layoffs in
the larger community could come
in the future.”

Collins says he “wants for
workers to feel secure, but they
should always be concerned if their
position is essential. We must re-
main competitive with the outside
market and good management

maintains this competiveness.” He

‘believes those workers who “are

working a hard days work” should
feel secure. Collins does not “an-
ticipate” any changes in the imme-
diate future. Brantley says, “I

would hope that this would never |

happen again.” yee a f

Collins “wants to ensure that ”

we don’t have fluff” and thus feels
changes are sometimes necessary.”
He does not want to be a “Maytag
repairman,” meaning that he does
not want to have people who do not
have a job to do. He says, “We
want to be here because we have
work to do.”

Collins says that he got rec-
ommendations from people in all
levels of the Physical Plant to find
ways to become more efficient.
Brantley says that the Physical
Plant “tried to spread out the people
being laid off, so one area would
not be impacted.” Collins says,
“Most of the employees felt that
the right decision was made, but
just had a question of who was
fired.”

replacement. “I think that the place-
ment function of this person who's
supposed to replace me in the ca-
reers office is going to suck up so
much of that person’s time and
energy that that person isn’t going
to be as free as I have been for the
last four years to work with indi-
viduals on individualized plans of
experience.

There is no question in my
mind that Experiential Programs
ought to be central to the function
of Career Services. I think that’s
the direction Career Services is
going these days, and I think that’s
exactly where it should be as it
relates to career development in
terms of internships, externships,
mentoring programs, and things

like that that have a career focus.
But experience-based learning is
just too big and too powerful to be
confined to Career Services.”

What about the future?

Wood sees the need for Expe-
riential Programs to have an in-
creasing academic role as the
twenty-first century approaches.
He explains that if Experiential
Programs were to strengthen its
role in this arena, then it would
need an organizer. ‘Academic
departments such as biology and
political science have experiential
programs, but they are scattered
and sometimes not well coordi-
nated. I would like to see a person
pull them together. The person
hired at career services is not going
to have time’ to work with those
departments.

If there was an office of expe-
riential programs staffed by a per-

son who had a richer background
than I have in pedagogy, then I
think that that person could help
service programs, the Bonner pro-

* gram, Reach-Out, faculty mem-

bers, and this whole institution in-
corporate experience more fully
into the developmental mission of
this institution.

I am not leaving this institu-
tion with any feeling of loss. Iam
very much excited by the careers
office continuing to have experi-
ential learning as an important part
of their mission, but I feel like
that’s only part of the power and
the potential of experienced-based
learning, and it could be much more
widely utilized on this campus, but
it may not be more widely utilized
if this office is allowed to die and if
I am not replaced by somebody
who has the background to work
with faculty.”

Dougherty wants a large base
of people for the team. “Anyone
who people get along with and
listen to is welcome.” Since
Dougherty will graduate in May,
he particularly encourages under-
classmen to attend the next meet-
ing, which will be on Thursday,

March 16 at 4:30 p.m. in the Con-
ference Room of the Union.

Dougherty says, “We need to

people like Rosemary, who works

people about different issues. It
would be great to educate people
like that about these issues so they
