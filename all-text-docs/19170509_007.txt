Reasonable Prices.
Leave orders with

large enough for our needs, rather than
to have a smaller one with a swimming
‘pool. Every one regrets this necessity.
but the rise in price of building makes
it necessary. If. however, we could raise
an additional $5.co00, the swimming pool
could be put in at once, and ane gentle-
man said to the President of the College
that if this was done he would give an
additional $500. We leave it to you,
Davidson Alumni.

Let as. hear from vou quickly and let
us all-as loval sons rally to the undertak-
ing and share with our brothers the
honor of putting the first Alumni build-
‘ing on the eld campus. Send checks
or pledges to Mr. F. UL. Jackson, Treas-
urer, Davidson, N. C.. with vour class
year marked on them (graduating vear,
whether you graduated or nat), and do
it quickly.

Shoe Repair Work Post Script: In spite of “war prices”
we have been able to retain the building
for the of full size and have contracted for the

building and heating. We have had to
leave out some things, but they can be
added later. We have not enough moncy
pledged to put in as much plumbing as is
needed. We ought to raise at least a
thousand dollars additional at once. and
much better, raise fifteen hundred, We
can easily do it if all will help when help
is really needed. Do nat wait, but send
in additional amounts if vou have sub-
scribed before. or a good amount if you
have not. Let us have the gvmnasium
