Wake Forest Jinx Gets
Severe Test in Turkey
Day Tilt With Wildcats

Wildcats Have Won Nine Out of
Seventeen Games Since 1908

DEACONS ARE HEAVIER

Younger Coached Machine Has
Never Defeated the Baptists

A jinx of eight years’ standing will be a
severe test on Thanksgiving Day next week,
when a fighting Wildcat team takes the field
against a heavier Deacon outfit. Since 1908,
the two teams have played 17 games, David-

son annexing nine of them, while only four
have gone to Wake Forest. The other four
have been tie games. But since 1920, David-
son has not won a game from the Demon
Deacons, and four times a seeming victory
has been snatched away from them in the
closing minutes of the game by a swift rally
to tie the score on the part of the Deacons. |
Not since Monk Younger and Tex Tilson
at have the Wildcats
been able to win out over Wake Forest.

A short resume of cach.game played since
Younger and Tilson took over the reins at
Davidson in 1923 may give some idea as to
to dominate a Wildcat team when they
face Wake Forest. But how this jinx came
about seems a mystery, for before 1920, the
Wildcats defeated the Deacons unmercifully
from year to year, swamping them in 1917

by the overwhelming score of 72-7.
On the afternoon of October 25, 1923, the
first Younger-coached eleven took a 6-0

lacing from the Wake Forest heavyweights.
The thin Wildeat line fought
thrust made by the mighty Deacon forward
wall, but Greason, fast Baptist back, slipped
through the line in mid-field and traveled the
intervening distance to the goal. It was a
hard-fought contest but Wake Forest out-
powered the fighting Wildcats for their sec-

going to take the game at 3-0, but in the
last quarter the Baptists were able to get
in position for a field goal which was suc-
cessful. Outside of these two field goals,
neither team made any serious threat, but
see-sawed back and forth in the middle of
the field most of the time.

Next year, it was Wake Forest's year to
spring a surprise by tying Davidson for the
fourth and last time since the two teams

this game above all others, and nothing

The Davidson line as a whole played
the best game of the season, and the
backs were quick to take advantage of
the gaping holes they found opened
for them in the Carolina forward wall.
It was the sheer power of Davidson's
drive and fight that enabled them to
carry the ball down the field time
after time. Except for an occasional
spinner or a cross buck, the plays
called by Captain Fraley were straight
off-tackle and over guard movements
that depended upon getting the men
on the ground for their success, and
this was done with tiresome regular-
ity—for the Tar Heels.
