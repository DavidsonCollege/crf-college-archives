most able fielder: in this section of the
South. At base-running, “Tiny” was
peculiarly adept and he had a faculty
for rattling his opponents.

The diamond and gridiron did not!
alone form the fields of his endeavor. ,
Among the students he was very popu-
lar and he was trusted as a man and a
friend. He was a member of the Beta
Theta Pi fraternity.

In his illustrious career at Davidson,
Graham was President and Vice-Pres-
ident of the “D” Club, President and
Vice-President of the Athletic Associa-
tion and was a member of the Pan-Hel-
lenic Council. °

“Tiny” was always noted for his clean,
hard fighting and his ability to keep his
head at all times. |

Saturday morning was taken up by!
talks from Dr. Frazer of Queens College,
and Harry Price of Davidson. After a
few short talks the evening session was_
adjourned for a few hours of recreation.

DAVIDSON
FIVE YEARS AGO

In a hard gruelling game at Winston-

| Salem, the University of North Caro-

lina obtained sweet revenge for their
14-7 defeat in the previous year, by
driving through the fighting Wildcats
for a ‘10-0 victory. It was one of the
most bitterly-fought contests that Win-
ston-Salem had viewed in some time;
and the “thin red line” of Davidson gave
way only after repeated substitutions of
fresh Carolina weight. During almost
the entire game, the ball see-sawed back
and forth, neither team being able to
penetrate its opponent's “rock-ribbed”
defense at the vital moment when a
scoring opportunity was presented. But
in the last period, with only a few min-
utes of playing time, the Tar Heels sub-
stitutions and weight began to have its
telling effect on the already trembling

Davidson line; and, just as the sun was,
going down back of the western hills, ! year.

THE GREENSBORO COLLEGE
GLEE CLUB

(Continued from page 1)

It was beautifully sung, and
the costume wory by Miss Mitchell enhanced
its delightfulness. This was followed by
choruses rendered by the glee club as a unit.

Mr. G. F, Alexander, director of the club,
entertained with a solo after an intermission,
and this was followed by an interesting one-
act play, “The Lion and the Lady.” There
were two characters, Miss Augusta Sample,
who represented Henry Earlsford, an actor;
and Miss Grace Yarborough, Lady Margaret
Mandeville, who assumed the role of a maid
to finally merit the good graces of Henry
Earlsford.

Miss Seiler, pianist, gave an excellent se-
lection. The closing numbers were choruses,
with Miss Lolita Ellis as soloist. Miss Ellis
won the admiration of the audience in her
rendition of “Somebody’s Knocking at Your
| Door,” assisted by the entire glee club.
| Students aided the last number considerably
