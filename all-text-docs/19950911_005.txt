SGA invites students
to biweekly meetings oe

Staff Writer

SGA President Bill Gullan has
instituted bi-weekly meetings in-
volving SGA members and the rest
of the Davidson College commu-
nity to discuss campus issues.

Attendance at the town meet-

ing will be optional for SGA sena-_

tors but Gullan encourages sena-
tors and students alike to partici-
pate.

The meetings are tentatively
scheduled to be held every second
Thursday .night at seven o’clock
and will focus on one issue of
concern for students and the col-
lege.

The discussion will be more
informal and open than during the
SGA’s mandatory Tuesday meet-
ings. Chancellor Dennis Seavers
will not keep minutes and most
parliamentary procedure will be
suspended.

dent well informed on the night’s
issue, the floor will open up to
anyone wanting to participate.

Gullan has compared the pro-
posed Thursday gathering to a
“townmeeting.” -

According to Gullan, the ex-
tra meeting has been proposed be-
cause “the SGA has long wanted
people to come and participate in
the process of trying to attain
progress. We hope this will be a
vehicle through which the SGA
will be able to hear from the com-
munity on different issues and the
community will benefit from a
public discussion of the issues that
face Davidson College.”

Reactions from the senators
Tuesday night were mostly posi-
tive. Junior senator Mike Farley
says, “I think the town meetings
will be the most useful thing SGA
does if students attend.”

It seems that now, the biggest
worry is the reaction and participa-
tion from students. Sara Beth

Hamlin says “that student response
will predict the success of these
meetings.”

Vice President Warren Buford
wants students to know that these
meetings are not strictly for SGA
members to discuss weekly mat-
ters. Instead, they will be useful in
involving the community and get-
ting their feedback on important
issues.

The SGA is welcoming and
encouraging students to attend. The
SGA hopes the “second meeting”
will provide a more open environ-
ment for students to express their
ideas and feelings about what is
going on around campus.

The first “town meeting” will
be held Thursday night at 7 p.m. in
Chambers Gallery. The topic will
be campus beautification.

If all goes well, Sophomore
class President Buster Burk be-

lieves it wilkbe “student and SGA
— one happy town meeting.”

low water.

Alsoincluded in the $200, 000
plan are restrooms, a play station,
a boardwalk, a fishing dock, and
nature paths. Phase two, estimated
at $300,000 would include tennis
and basketball courts.

Britt anticipates the town will
finance the first stage, completing
the second stage only if funds can
be found elsewhere.

Still, some have objections to
altering the pond. Davidson senior
Jen Scheutz is writing her thesis on
the dynamics of the pond debate.
She worries that the draining would
temporarily displace many animals
and would be a severe disruption
of the ecosystem.

“As an environmentalist,” she
says, “I’d like to work with the
black community there [near the
pond] with recreation equipment

for social purposes, but not do any-
thing with the water.”

Five years ago, Biology Pro-
fessor Dr. John Williamson sug-
gested naturalizing the area to
“shield the ugliness.” He believes
that planting native trees and plants
is essential in helping to minimize
erosion. “Grass doesn’t do it,” he
says. “It doesn’t hold sand on
those banks ... Five years from
now, they will have to dredge
again.”

Because the town has been
slow to act on local concerns, the
pond’s condition has degenerated.
The relationship between the town
and African-American residents
has correspondingly worsened.

The pond may yet be im-
proved, but not all of the African-
American residents there feel it
will be in response to their efforts.

One resident says, “They’re
not doing it [now] because most
people there are black. Maybe
now that some [white] people are
coming into town, they’ ll do some-
thing about it.”
