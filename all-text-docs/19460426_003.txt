If any one athletic group deserves the maximum in at-
tention and praise, it’s the golf team. With limited financial
help, no coaching, and constant handicaps, the boys have
done very well for themselves. Although they dropped a
match to a slow-scoring Clemson team, the Wildcat golfers
have trimmed South Carolina twice. Don Bryant, who
organized the current squad and is a veteran of the 1943
aggregation, won the Iirst llight title at the recent
Southern intercollegiate tournament, while Allen Meade
took Second Flight honors: Esquire Hodgin and Ford
Little round out the first foursome. This is one Davidson
team that makes its own breaks, and is certainly worthy
of more publicity and care than it’s gotten in the past.

UNIONS AND HEARTS

Kiddie Finlay of the Columbia RECORD, muses in his
column over the possible outcome of unionized profession-
al baseball. Batters might protest against the pitchers’
throwing a sinker when he was expecting a slow ball, or
first baseman, because of union_rules, might be prevented
from playing third. May the Lewises and Petrillos stick
to their mines and music and let the sports world alone.
A drive sponsored by the University of Georgia athletic
associtation has yielded upwards of $20,000 for one of
the Bulldogs’ former All-Americans. Capt. George Posch-
ner, end on the great team of 1942 lost both feet in France;
and gained the hearts of thusands of grateful Georgians.
It was evident to those who saw the Clemson track meet
that Frank Matthews was running on little save his will
to win in the last hundred yards of the 440. He’s lowering
his time in every meet, and will be pushing the conference
leaders before long. Incidentally, the three South Carolina
men who took that race in Columbia repeated against N.C.
State, and in slower time than Matthews’ 53.2 seconds.
They area cleverly coached group, all three breaking for
the pole at the start and making passing a rough deal.
