14 THE DAVIDSONIAN

By KEVIN BIRNEY
Staff Writer

The baseball team endured one of the most
challenging weeks of the season this past
week with a murderous schedule that fea-
tured a game at the No. 2-ranked University
of North Carolina and a
three-game home series
against No. 20 College of
Charleston. The ’Cats
dropped all four games,
falling to 12-20 overall
and 2-10 in conference.

The week began with a
23-7 loss to the Tar Heels,
who jumped out to an
early 9-2 lead after two
innings. Davidson never
fully recovered from the
initial attack. Starter Rob
Shenk ’07 was pulled after
1.2 innings, and the ’Cats
were forced to use a total
of seven pitchers during
the game.

Davidson made a come-
back bid with four runs in
the fifth to tighten the
score at 10-6, but the Heels exploded for
eight runs in the bottom of the sixth and five
more in the last three innings to seal the deal.

Alex Entrekin ’06 led the way for the
’Cats, going two-for-four with three RBI.

On Friday, the team began a three-game
series with No. 20 College of Charleston.
Once again, the ’Cats started the ball game
sluggishly, allowing four runs, including two
home runs in the first two innings.

Starter Blake Osborn ’07 settled down
after the first two innings, however, shutting
out the Cougars in the next three innings.
Meanwhile, Davidson began to gain momen-

in the fourth.

In the sixth, however, Charleston respond-
ed with a two-run shot to stretch the lead to
6-2, then padded their lead with six runs in
the last two innings. The Cougars finished

with a 12-3 win to begin the series.

After a rainout on Saturday, the ’Cats took
the field once again on Sunday for a double-
header. The first game ended in a dismal 1-6
loss. Charleston’s pitching proved to be too
solid, and they held the Davidson squad to
one run.

Cougar starter Danny Meszaros struck out
11 in 7.1 innings of work.

Wildcat ace Rob Wilson ’07 did well,
holding Charleston to three earned runs

.through six innings, but lack of run support

hurt Davidson. Jay Heafner ’06 had the lone
RBI for the ’Cats, going two-for-four for the

ae second half of the Sunday double-
header, and the last game of the three-game .
set, went about the same way for the ’Cats.
Again, an early deficit did Davidson in, as
Charleston put up six runs in the first.

Much of the myuble was of the ’Cats’ own
doing. For the
game, the team
committed five
errors, giving
Charleston’s already
good team too many
opportunities to
score. Davidson
attempted a come-
back, scoring three
runs in the third, but
Charleston’s pitch-
ing silenced the
*Cats from there on,
while adding to
their lead.

In the end, the
Cougars won 11-3,
handing Davidson
its  sixth-straight
loss.

“We faced one of
the best pitching staffs we’ve seen so far in
College of Charleston,” said Heafner. “Their
depth also gives them a bonus. As always,
they played fundamental baseball and capi-
talized on any opportunities we gave
them. We played catch-up most of the week-
end, which doesn’t fit with our style of
play. Hopefully we’ll be able to get back on
track against Duke on Wednesday and at
UNC-G this weekend.”

The ’Cats will attempt to correct the prob-
lems in the coming week, with a game at
Duke today at 7 p.m., followed by a weekend
series on the road against UNC-Greensboro
