Jacques Andreani spoke at Davidson Wednesday.

French Ambassador shares
his world vision with campus

By Phoebe Dean
Jacques Andreani, French
Ambassador to the United States
and career diplomat, brought his
vision of “Current Franco-Ameri-
can Relations” to Davidson on
Wednesday night.

Andreani’s expertise in the
field comes from his experience in
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
which he joined in 1953, and his
subsequent experience as French
Ambassador to Washington (1955-
60), Egypt (1979-81), Italy (1984),
and the United States (1989-94).

Andreani traced the origins of
the current Franco-American alli-
ance tothe post-World War II years
when two modern security sys-
tems were established, the Unite

‘Nations and NATO. Despite the”

fact that these organizations are
currently changing in order to meet
the challenges of the post-Cold
War Era, Andreani argued that they
will maintain their validity as uni-
fying and shaping forces in Euro-
pean-American relations. T h e
Ambassador also remarked on the
unprecedented European integra-
tion taking place today and dis-
cussed its effect on world politics.
Economic and social restructuring
has resulted in a “complex politi-
cal fermentation” which has made
relations difficult for many Euro-
pean nations. Andreani pointed
out, however, that the fundamental
interests of England, France, and
the United States remain the same.

The French government, ac-
cording to Andreani, envisions
NATO as “a centerpiece for Euro-
pean security” in the future. Con-
trary to this vision remains the fact
that NATO and the European
Union have been unable to halt the
tragic events in the former Yugo-
slavia.

The United Nations has au-
thorized only three types of action
in the Balkans—humanitarian aid,
diplomatic efforts, and preparation
for military intervention. France
has contributed the most troops to
the humanitarian aid effort.

The combination of over 100
wounded French troops and the
ineffectiveness of the UN mea-
sures have made the French frus-
trated, Andreani expressed.

“What France calls for is an
international strength of purpose,”

the Ambassador stated. He ex-

pressed France’s desire to deliver
an ultimatum to Serbs in Bosnia
which would order the removal of
artillery from Sarajevo. “NATO
should apply force to defend this
resolution,” Andreani continued,
“for only through coordinated ef-
fort can positive results be

achieved.” On Wednesday NATO

issued this ultimatum to Serbs in

Bosnia.

Andreani also spoke of the
changing Franco-American eco-
nomic alliance. As 68% of US
overseas investment is currently in
Europe, Andreani thinks that trade
relations between the two coun-
tries will remain strong because of
shared interests.

He did convey France’s wish
to be “listened to and considered
more,” however, as the United
States takes into account the Euro-
pean Union and shapes new eco-
nomic policies.

Ambassador Andreani thinks
that in the future European-Ameri-
can relations will become more of
a bi-lateral arrangement in which
France and the United States can
rest on “equal footing.” Shared
values, despite a shifting market,
are what give the US and France a
common outlook.
