Faculty visit Court for Connor late-night

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Staff writer

Connor House invited all fac-
ulty members to a cookout and late
night March 31 with invitations
that read, “No Essays, No Tests,
Just Class Participation,” empha-
sizing their desire to socialize with
professors without the stress of
academics.

Approximately 25 faculty
members out of almost 150 at-
tended the event with their fami-
lies. Among the departments rep-
resented were psychology, history,

english, and math.

Dr. Donna Molinek v was en-
couraged by several students to
attend and feels the reinforcement
was helpful to recognize which of
her students were members of the
eating house. She felt that the
turnout was good, given the differ-
ing opinions about the Court and
other commitments made by mem-
bers of the faculty, such as a math
conference.

Dr. Scott Denham felt that fac-
ulty members may have been more
inclined to accept the invitation
had it been more personal. “The

house inviting the faculty is back-
wards. Students should be inviting
professors.” Denham did not at-
tend as he was out of town.
Connor members tried to re-
inforce the general invitation by
inviting their professors directly.
Though it undoubtedly made a dif-
ference in the turnout, many feel
that it would be unreasonable to
expect a personal invitation.

Dr. John Wertheimer stated:
[Professors] shouldn’t expect to
be invited personally when the
whole faculty is invited.”
Wertheimer recognized that the

effort to invite the faculty was “‘out
of respect.”

He included that the event
allowed him to become more com-
fortable with the procedures of the
court. He also enjoyed the chance
to talk with former and current
students and advisees in a more
comfortable atmosphere.

Dr. Sara Beasley was also ap-
proached by Connor members en-
couraging her to go.

Although she feels it is not
necessary, “Personal invitations do
make a difference.” Of the whole
event she commented, “I was ex-

tremely impressed that they had
gone to that trouble.”

Connor members were
pleased with the event overall. Jill
Dyer, President of Connor House,
states, “I appreciated that the fac-
ulty came, and I liked talking to
them outside of the classroom ... It
offered a different avenue to get to
know them.”

Molinek added that the even
smaller number of faculty repre-
sented at the late night was due to
the time. “I’m not a late night per-
son, anyway,” she says. “I wouldn’t
have been awake.”

Speakers discuss race issues

Ross, Watson talk about surviving on a “white” campus

By Patricia EvANS
Staff writer

Friday evening, 30 students
and faculty of different ethnic ori-
gins gathered to discuss issues and
concerns about going to a predomi-
nantly white school like Davidson.

Moderated by RJR Consult-
ants Michelle Watson and Ron
Ross, the program began with an
anecdote about Ross’ own back-
ground, one spent at UNC-Chapel
Hill among about 50 minority stu-
dents.

The second stage of the dis-
cussion was a combination of an-
swering the question, “Why are we
at Davidson?” and identifying is-
sues that minority students or any
students here at Davidson face.

Among reasons for being at
Davidson were the opportunities
— to go abroad, to have student-
teacher interaction, to get involved
and have good resources, the fi-

nancial aid generosity, the personal
attention from students, and the
size, rigor, and environment that
Davidson provides as a liberal arts
college.

Issues that the discussion
brought up were academic, eco-
nomical, emotional, and financial
and related to identity, society, and
alienation.

In the third stage of the
evening, Ross and Watson split the
audience into six groups of four to
five students and faculty each. Each
group’s job was tolist issues which
they saw within the previously is-
sued catagories.

Some of the more localized
issues included the misconception
that work-study equals financial
aid, the social issues of being a
minority at Davidson College, the
closed-mindedness of many stu-
dents, and the questioning of iden-
tity.

Senior Jason Burt said, “I just

hope that it keeps going in future
years.” Ron Ross expressed a key
point in dealing with racial ten-
sions: “Don’t push back.”

Dr. Nancy Fairley pushed the
importance of upperclassman role
models for minority students: “Up-
perclassmen have to tell the truth
... they need to take responsibility
and really be honest [about
Davidson].”

In closing, the group formed a
cirlce and,holding hands, recited
the affirmation, “If I am honest,
open, and willing, I will be suc-
cessful.”

Ross’ final remarks were remi-
niscent of the reasons for coming
to Davidson and the resources that
Davidson offers: “Never forget
why you’re here. If you feel alien-
ated, it’s probably because you’re
doing it to yourself. Everything
you need to be successful is right
here. College is recognizing that
all I need is right here.”

Lewontin, whose landmark
research in population genetics has
been cited in Newsweek, brought
up the startling fact that the most
genetic difference is found within
members of the same race, not
between those of dissimilar ethnic
backgrounds, as is commonly
thought. “Eighty-five per cent of
all human polymorphism occurs in
local populations,” he said, “only
15 percent is between groups of
different races, which is surprising
given our prejudices.”

vanced genetic engineering will

DNA, little of that knowledge is
now applicable to fighting disease.
“The number of diseases that this
is open to is very small,” he said.

In the afternoon, board mem-
bers were able to attend small group
meetings with Davidson life sci-
ence professors, to discuss more
specific issues such as the “psy-
chology of learning” and the dura-
bility of the human brain.
