Meter-Maids to Gain
National Exposure On TV's Fox

By Leppy McAlchie

Fox Broadcaoadcasting Net-
work surprised the Davison Col-
lege community today by announc-
ing plans for the popular and con-
troversial television
program COPS! to film
the Davidson College
police force in action
for an upcoming epi-
sode.

Said executive
producer Mark Shlum-
berger, “Weheard these
guys take criminals
right by the balls and
knew they deserved to
be honored on our
show.” The Davidson
police squad has been
recognized by the Fra-
ternal Order of Police
and the National Bob-
bies of America Association as
one of the most efficient forces in
the country. They were especially
commended for their proficiency
inconfiscation of liquor possessed
by minors and high speed “Cush-

an” chases.

“Well, I don’t like to brag, but
we have the highest number of in-
dictments, convictions, and the
most efficient record keeping sys-
tem for parking violations in the
entire South-Eastern region,” said
one officer who spoke only under
anonymity--However, the striking

resemblance to Officer Hightower
of Police Academy fame makes
him a conspicuous part of the
DCPF.

to the campus in early September.
“We would.like to follow some of
the officers on their Friday night

beats on the infamous Patterson ~

Court. We’ve heard those crazy
Sig Ep’s really can party ‘til the
crack 0’ dawn, and the officers
warn us that it may be a dangerous
situation -- but as the motto on my
desk says, ‘You can’t be any more
psychotic than that Van Goff guy’!”
stated: one of Shlumberger’s nu-
merous assistants apparently re-
ferring to the late artist, Vincent
Van Gogh. 52

Asked what might be expected
during the three day filming, Offi-
cer Harding of the DCPF replied,
“Well, you’ll probably get to know
‘The Pantry’ pretty darn well, and
if we’re lucky, we might
get to escort.one of those
hot chicks down the hill
from the library. You
wouldn’t think it, but
those Cushmen really
turn a lot of the ladies
on.” .

While _histori-
cally being touted as one
of the most respected
forces the College has
ever had, the DCPF has
recently facedallegations
of involvement in the
Kappa Sigma fraternity
drug ring (See page 3 ).
When questioned on the
subject, that big guy behind the
desk declined tocomment. Asked
if he was aware of the allegations
when he chose to cover the DCPF,
Shlumberger responded, “Well
hell, nobody said those boys were
perfect.”

Shlumberger expects the epi-
sode to air in late October as the
Davidson community eagerly
awaits. One member of the Sigma
AlphaEpsilon house expressed his
anticipation, “I can’t wait. I’m
gonna go out, kick some Bes and
get on Ty. if

Kickin' the Ballistics

Menkhaus, Long To Appear This Summer
With Three Big-Haired Babestresses on TV Hit Studs

By Freelove Upthumpa

After an afternoon of unmen-
tionable debauchery involving liq-
uor, women, guns, drugs, small
children, an albino typist, three
chickens anda trampoline at onc
of Charlotte’s more disreputable
drinking establishments, Professor
of Political Science, Ken “Doll”
Menkhaus, and Professor of Eng-
lish, David “Love-Me-Don’t-
Judge-Me” Long, tried out for the
smash hit television show Studs
during a recent Charlotte visit by
the show’s crew.

Following several hours of
grueling interviews where the two
fielded questions regarding their
past sexual conquests, Menkhaus
was chosen to appear on the show.
Long’ sinterview took less time, as
the show’s producers we’re in-
stantly captivated by his Sch-
warzeneggarian physique. During
the beginning of April the two were
flown to California to tape an in-
stallment of the show, which will
air thissummer. Before the show
was taped both of Davidson’s fin-
est went on dates with three “fabu-
lous babes” from the Los Angeles
area. .The two men then taped

Studs, deciphering questions
from the teenagers to deter-

mine who had the best time
on the date, and which of the
two is the biggest “stud.”
The results are a closcly
guarded secret until June,
but Davidson’s faculty and
student communities have
been making some scrious
book in the meantime. The
safe money, according to ex-
perts, is on Menkhaus.
Senior Courtney Nichols has
for several months touted
the young professor’s de-
sirability across campus. In
spite of her recently-devel-
oped and rather adolescent
fascination with Tom Ka-
zee, Nichols says she con-
siders Menkhaus, “quite a

piece,” and notes a certain
animal attraction. In addi-
tion to his looks, Menkhaus
hasacertain arrogant, know-
it-all about everything, type
of flair which most women find
impossible to ignore.

Gamblers with a taste for risk,

however, have decided to bet the

whole hog on Long. “Bald is beau-

tiful,” said a senior who did not
wish to be identified. “I just can’t
getenough of his enthusiasm,” she
continued; .“*he’s got this energy

which sets me on fire! -I mean,
sure, he walks through the day like

he’s just barely out of acoma, but
that’s only his image. Inside the

man is seething with masculine

‘charge.”

“It’s the bitches I like,” said

Menkhaus about the show. “I like

trying my lines on poorly edu-
cated, synthetically clothed, and
gargantuan haired little skirts.
Makes me feel pretty important,
you know, like I matter,” hc added.

Long was a bit more demure.
“T ‘m not all that comfortable with
the cthical standards established
by the show. I mean, the whole
point of Studs isto set two guys up
to go out and have sex with the
same three women, and then com-
pare notes on national TV! The
experiences shared between aman
and a woman are sacred, tender,
intimate moments which shouldn’t
be discussed in any place less

‘sacred than, say, a fraternity house.

But damn if it don’t beat grading
papers!”

Neither would divulge any
details about their dates, saying
that the college community would
have to wait until the summer to
learn who is the bigger. “stud.”
“Let’s just say, a good time wad
definitely had by all!” blathered
Menkhaus; ;
