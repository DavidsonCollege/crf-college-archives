New Building Should Be Named
In Honor Of Pres. Cunningham

The year 1956-57 will be looked
back on as a transition in the history
of Davidson College. It is the end of
an era, and the beginning of another.

The contributions and services of
Dr. John Rood Cunningham over the
past sixteen years have firmly estab-
lished Davidson as one of the leading
educational! institutions in the South.
In a real way, his administration has
lead the college to new and perma-
nent heights that a lesser man might
well have failed to achieve.

Dr. Cunningham's work has mani-
fested for the college what a decade
ago might have been termed a vision.
He came to Davidson with a plan—
a desire “to do and to make” tangible

achievements. He leaves with that
vision accomplished.

Any statement concerning the
work that Dr. Cunningham has done
for the college would be an under-
evaluation. The results of his devo-
tion to Davidson can be seen plainly
in the coliege plant. He has preserved
the good of the old and planted anew
that which was better.

In honor of a great President of
Davidson College, and as a reminder
of the loyality and devotion of her fa-
vorite son, the least that could. be
done would be for one of the pro-
posed new buildings (or the new dor-
mitory) to bear the name, John Rood
Cunningham.

Labor Reforms Long Over-Due

Tailor made suits, interest-free
loans, racing stables, plush Palm
Springs homes, and lost union rec-
ords are the symbols of a situation
that has shocked the American peo-
ple in the past few months.

We have seen Messers Beck,
Brewster, and Hoffa (the real stars of
the show) parade before the witness
stand. While they did not say all that
they might have, their testimony
brought to the public view the fact
that in the councils of Big Labor, too
few men hold too much power.

At present, the AFL-CIO has a
monopoly over the nation’s labor
unions. This giant labor organization
can cripple the American economy on
a few hour’s notice. And the amazing
fact is that the czars of Big Labor are
protected by present federal laws.

Yes. is is legally okay for Big
Labor to do exactly what the anti-
trust laws say that Big Business can-
not do. Moreover. the entangling
hand of the federal government has
brought organized labor under its
protective wing.

Fortunately, the Taft-Hartly Act
of 1947 corrected many of the in-
justices of the Wagner Act of 1935
which gave rise to Big Labor. Never-
theless, a large and powerful union
organization still enjoys special and
paternalistic government protection.

For so long the pendulum has
swung in favor of Big Labor. It ap-
pears that the reforming conscience
of the American people will demand
that it now swing the other way.

In 1890, the Sherman Anti-Trust

Law helped to put Big Business in its
proper perspective. Before much
longer, there must be reform in the
field of Big Labor.

First, labor unions should be put
under the anti-trust laws. To our way
of thinking, it is just as wrong for
the unions to get together to para-
lyze America as it is for the manu-
facturers to combine to fix prices.

Next, the union high command
should be decentralized by returning
to the locals much of the control and
power to call strikes. The power and
right to strike should rest “closer to
home.”

Finally, all of the states should
adopt “right to work” laws. The right
not to join a union (or any other or-
ganization for. that matter) is the per-
rogrative of every man. The power
to force a man to join a union (else
lose his job) is tyranny.

The Labor Movement in America
has made great and noble strides in
the past few decades. Some of its
achievements have been slow in com-
ing and long needed. Nevertheless,
the near absolute power that Big La-
bor commands today is both danger-
ous and umnneccessary.

Tt is up to the people through their
State and federal officials to bring
Big Labor into line with present day
concepts of democratic ideals about
economic and political liberty. It can-
not be expected to reform itself any
more than Big Business was able to
reform itself.

Please,
Mr. Martin

The summer vacation is the usual
time for making improvements in the
college facilities. Among the most
needed are more parking spaces. We
can have these by making better use
of existing areas.

Specifically, we suggest the fol-
lowing improvements:

(1) the painting of white lines to
indicate specific spaces for each car
on the north side of the road behind
East, West, and Duke Dormitories.
There is enough room along the north
side of this road for approximately
twenty-two cars if properly spaced,
but due to hap-hazard parking often
only seventeen or eighteen cars are
able to find enough room.

(2) the leveling and paving of the
parking area between East and Duke
Dorm on the south side of the road.
At present, there is a cement water

drain that takes up unnecessary
space. This drain could be made level
with the ground. Immediately behind
Duke, more cars could park if the
existing area was better laid-out, and
white lines painted.

And by the way, if there are any
half-spaces left over, “M-G" owners
could have a special place to fit their.
vehicles.

Profanity
In reference to some of the ex-
treme language used in the vocal in-

ter-communication system between
the dormitories, we submit the follow-

ing:

High Standards, Worthy Goals

(Ed. Note: The following
is an excerpt from a speech
delivered by Dr. Sohn R.
Cunningham in chapel on
May 2, 1957)

All persons with purpose and
ambition desire the requisites
of leadership. We must con-
ceive it not as a right but as
a responsibility. It is my pur-
pose to name at least four of
the requisites of true leader-
ship.

In the first place, I would list
Capacity. It is not enough that
one possesses a strong body, a
keen mind and an ability to
assert his purpose to tead.
There must be cultivated in-
telligence. Personality, which
is a composite of many quali-
ties, is also a necessity and one
which must be and can be great-
ly cultivated. Furthermore,
there is the requisite in the
area of Capacity of the ability
to communicate with others.

SOUND CHARACTER

In the second place, I would
mention the essential of sound
Character. The stars in their
courses fight against low mo-
rals and shoddy practices. Let
no person assume that he can
long be an effective leader with-
out a Character in which hu-
man beings can fee: confident.

In the third place. there is

the essential of true Courage.
Courage is more than a physi-
eal quality. It is this essential
which breeds faith and opti-
mism, which believes that the
right can be done and should
be done and dares to risk one-
self in its accomplishment. It
was this quality of courage
which led Woodrow Wilson to
remark “I would rather lose in
a cause which will ultimately
win than to win in a cause
that will ultimately lose.”

And the fourth essential to
true leadership is Commitment.
Human. beings are impressed
by and stand resdy to follow
the man who is willing to com-
mit his all to his purpose. It
was this quality to which our
Saviour referred when he said
“Whosoever saveth his life shall
lose it, but whosoever loseth
his life for My sake, will save
it.” ;

Escape?

From What?

By JOHN BERNHAROT

It seems to be an accepted
part of our modern psychology
to develop little quirks and
habits that help us get free
from the unpleasant things that
seem to surround us. Every-
body now-a-days has escape
mechanisms—smoking a ciga-
rette, scratching an ear, play-
ing with a pencil while study-
ing, rocking back and forth in
the chair while reading a text-
book.

BROADER ESCAPES

Here at Davidson we have
still broader escapes—whole
evenings watching a flick or
TV. a night of bridge, or a
weekend off at another school.
We don't like to face the un-
pleasant reality of work at Da-
vidson.

DAVIDSON REALITY

This suggests that either we
think the reality of Davidson
is wrong, or we just don’t want
to face any true reality.

The problems of facing life,
and of working hard when
necessary, are real problems.
Do we here try to escape too
much? Look at how much time
and talk we spend on playing
with pencils, rocking back and
forth on our chairs, watching
TV, and going off campus on
weekends.

It isn't necessary to be a

Bernhardt

bookworm or a woman-hater,
but maybe a better balance is
needed. Escape mechanisms
seem to be a part of our mo-
dern society. But Davidson, or
any college, should prepare us
to go out and meet life. If we
concentrate too much on escap-
ing here, are we preparing our-
selves as we need to for meet-
ing reality later? Will we be
able to run off every weekend
when we are “on our own?”

McAFEE

While many personalities will
be missing from the faculty and
administration next year, one
of the most regrettable ab-
sences in this period of turn-
over in the school will be Dr.
Malcolm McAfee. Into a school
which has been accused of. ex-
cessive conservatism but never
of extreme liberalism, he has
brought a little of the liberal
thought of the outside world.

Although ideas different from
our own are not usually agree-
able to us, they are essential
to a liberal education, and Dr.
McAfee has contributed much in

filling out our ideas with the
liberal, the progressive, and the
new. Davidson will certainly
miss Dr. McAfee’s leavening in-
fluence in its approaching re-
modeling program.

Leadership in some measure

is possible for all who will qual-°

ify themselves for it.

Gambetta was a young man
of modest background in the
country of France in the last
century. At the age of 19 he
was leaving his humble home
to go to Paris to study law. He
recalled throughout his later
years that his mother’s ambi-
tion and plea to him as he left
was “Come back somebody.”

COME BACK SOMEBODY

With that purpose firmly set,
he took his place in the lead-
ership of his nation in one of
the most critical periods of her
history and served in the minis-
try of his government in a re-
markable degree. Set for your-
self high standards, pure mo-
tives and worthy goals and
“Come back somebody.”

-Dramas

Rainmaker” represented a first
of its type for the Davidson
stage.
PACKED HOUSE

Midwinters Dance Weekend
set the scene for the Masquers’
second production. “Gramércy
Ghost”, a comedy in two acts,
provided a light, laugh-filled
evening for approximately 500
men and dates who attended.

DISAPPOINTMENTS

Thus, for the Red and Black
Masquers, it has been a suc-
cessful season though there
were disappointments. Through
the pressure of academic de-
mands, other events and activi-
ties, and possibly a tack of in-
terest, few of the Davidson stu-
dents supported these plays.
Only by student interest and
support, both in attendance and
participation in the productions
can drama be given its proper
place in the campus life.

LETTER: TO EDITOR

Leaders Discussed

Dear Editor:

In their lamb white ideals
and practices, the campus lead-
ership organ is overlooking a
symposium of talent that some-
times makes me want to cry
out, “Well, good lordy, how can
they be so eyeless?” It is such
a tremendous chance to lash
out again with the reins of
activity which they clutch so
tightly in their hot little paws,
that it sometimes makes a man
say, “But let us Stand up and
put the finger on the, rotten
Spot.”

The first, and by far the
most obvious, of the
pessed-by group is the
captain of the flick team.

For the job of Sam Myopic
is a noble one, taking many
arduous hours of service and
recruiting. Every night the
sound and the tumult of his
ever-growing band rip the goat-
cry from their throats as they
follow Sam Myopic anywhere
he will take them. This is lead-
ership, yes indeedy.

Sam’‘s running mate is al-
so @ serious contender for
campus honors. He is Bar-

ry Budweiser, captain of
the drinking team, perhaps
a post that requires more
stamina and strength of
spirit and convictions than
any other. His following is
legion, and the influence
which he exerts is thunder-
ing.

It is he who keeps his head
when all around are losing
theirs. And he gets the job
done, cans down.

These two are only a small
portion of the talent that is
lying fallow as a result of neg-
lect. I could mention scores of
others. Take the captains of the
sunbathing team, the road-run.-
ning team, the television squad,
the scratched knee team, the
unshaven club, the filter ciga-
rette organization, the I-Hate-
Chapel-and-Vespers delegation.

The list is unending. It is:
high time their talents were
dug from the ground, to shed
their light as the official organ

sheds theirs, for the betterment
of step-mother school. Lets put
them in their deserved place
on the official organ.

ROTC Evaluation

By BILL MARTIN
Commissioning exercises for
some 50 seniors on May 25 will
bring to a close the most suc-
cessful year the ROTC Cadet
Regiment has ever enjoyed at
Davidson.

For the first time in the

(Editor’s Note: The follow.
ing statement was released
teday by Lt. Col. John D.
Sepp.)

t wish to express my most
sincere appreciation to the
students, faculty and admini-
strative officials of David.
son College for the manner
in which they have received
and treated mé and my
family during our three
years with the college.

§ am particularly appreci-
ative of the splendid coope-
ration and support given the
Military Department by the
many student organizations.
it has been al! that one could
hope for.

it has been a distinct
privilege to work with the
young men of the caliber
found here and ! wish you
every success for the future.

Unit's history, all training and
administrative matters pertain-
ing to training were handled
entirely by the Cadet Officers.

SOPHOMORE INTEREST

It is very gratifying to all
concerned to find 67% of the
Sophomore class in ROTC ap-
plying for the Advanced Course.
Numerically this is a sizeable
increase over past years and
evinces a great deal of inter-
est in the program.

It would be unfair to say that
the complete success of the
program depended on the Cadet
Officers. Without the forceful
and enthusiastic leadership of
Col. Sapp and his staff the pro-
gram would never even have
gotten underway. _

The highlight of the year was
a visit from Hugh M. Milton,
Ass’t. Secy. of the Army. Mr.
Milton’s comments were as
laudatory as the ROTC could
wish for. He said that he could
add only superlative on superl-
ative as to the excellence of
the Unit. :

In an open letter to the Ca.
dets, Col.. Sapp expressed his
feelings as he called the year.
“, . . the most successful year
of the Cadet Regiment since
the undersigned. (Col. Sapp) as-
sumed the duties of PMS&T.”

Honor Fraternities

By JOHN GILMER

The primary function of the
Honorary Fraternity Council is
the coordination of the meet-
ing times of the honorary fra-
ternities and various extracur-
ricular organizations. ,

Another service which next
year’s council should consider
is a thorough evaluation of the
work of each of these groups.
Constructive criticism would
aid in strengthening the pro-
erams of the honorary fraterni-
ties. ‘

The purpose of such an or-

ganization is the recognition of
excellence in a particular
academic field. On this alone
the ‘honorary fraternity can
base a sound argument for con-
tinued existence.

tMPROVEMENT NEEDED

Many o1 these groups also
provide a valuable service to
their members and to the col-
lege. However, in others there
seems to be a lack of enthusi-
asm and much room for im-
provement.

COMMITTEE SKETCHES

By JOE BELL ;

The only man on the Commit-
