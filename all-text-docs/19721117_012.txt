members that he might
otherwise miss

Some students voiced an
interest in community projects
and community picnics which
would include the students of
Davidson College.

Another way to bridge the gap
separating students and faculty
is for the eating clubs on the
campus to invite faculty
members and their wives to
meals at the house.

Although some houses have
invited faculty sporadically in
the past. many feel it should be
done on a regular basis.
Random House invites two
professors and their wives to
eat every Wednesday night.

While this is a good
opportunity for students to get
to know professors better, it
also provides a way for the
students to meet the faculty
wives.

Several students and faculty
voiced the opinion that the
wives play an important role in
student-faculty relations. Suflas
said that ‘the faculty wives are
as willing as the professors to
improve student-faculty
relationships.”

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr., would like to see
Davidson adopt the policy of

each fraternity and eating club
having a faculty “fellow.”

Spencer added, “the fellows
would eat one or two meals a
week at the house and attend its
social events."

The faculty fellows might be
changed on a regular basis to
allow all of the faculty
members to participate.

“Hopefully, the relationship
between the faculty fellow and
the students would be an
informal one.” Spencer said.

A revival of faculty Open
House is also being considered
by the administration. Dean of
Students Will Terry has sent a
letter to all of the members of
the faculty to find out if they are
in favor of the idea and what, if
any, changes they want made
from the old Open House policy.

“One of the biggest reasons
that the old Open House died out
was the unfeelingness of the
students; many of them were
careless to the point of being
rude,” said Terry. So far, most
of the faculty members are in
favor of some sort of Open
House, Terry said.

This would allow students to
meet the faculty members on
their home ground, as well as
giving the students a chance to
meet the professors’ families.

One sort of *‘Open House” is

regard to the — football
scholarships. the college
donated an extra $14.000-15,000
above the baseline figure set by
the Trustees

The Trustees had determined
that the college would contribute
52 (for thenumber of scholarship
given) times the average need
scholarship (just under $1,000)
to the program for
scholarships This — total
amounted to about $50,500

But as the team needed more
money. the college agreed to
give the extra amount under the
stipulation that this would be
the last vear that they would do
so.

Debaters Out-Talk Opponents
| In Regional Competition Wins

By GARY STEWART
Staff Writer

Davidson's Debate Team has
won almost 90 percent of this
year’s meets including an
overwhelming victory in the
Wilmington Tournament and a
second place in the Wake Forest
Tournament.

“I'm really pleased that our
debaters are working so hard,”’
said Mrs. Jean Cornell, coach of
the team. “‘They have spent
about 16 hours a_ week
practicing their speeches and
researching the topic."’

This year's national debate
topic is, “‘Resolved: that the
Federal Government should
provide comprehensive
medical care for all U-S.
citizens."

The varsity team, Bill
Eskridge and Paul Mitchell,
has debated both sides of the
question and at Wilmington won
their division with a perfect 6-0
record.

Mitchell was selected as the
outstanding individual speaker
in the’ varsity division;
Eskridge finished fifth.

Bob Mooty and Steve
finished first among

members at present. Several
faculty members take each one
of their classes to their homes
at least once during the term, so
that students may learn where
the professor lives and may feel
more comfortable about
returning.

Some students and professors
would like to see a reciprocal
arrangement on the part of the
students. The students could
invite faculty members and
their wives to the dorms or
eating clubs for discussion
sessions or a small informal
party.

If any of these solutions are to
work, however, students and
faculty agree that both
constituencies must take the
intitiative. As one student put it,
“It takes two people to build
any sort of relationship.”

Wilmington while Billy
Crosland and Cary Herin placed
second.

Both teams had records of 5-1
and Mooty was selected as the
outstanding individual novice

speaker.
Of the affirmative novice
teams, Gary Lane and John

Munce placed first with five
wins and one loss, while Bill
Bond and Rick Roylance
secured a 3-3 record and tied for
fifth.

The team went to
Appalachian last weekend for a
meet in which students not only

debated but also could enter
four individual events----
impromptu speaking, original
oratory, and prose and poetry
reading.

‘Debating helps me in public
speaking and thinking more
clearly. It’s a lot of fun and has
many of the qualities of other
sports, such as team spirit and

competition,’ Bell explained.
The varsity team has been
invited to the prestigious

Annapolis Tournament this
year, she said. ‘This is of major
significance since only a
selected few will be there.”

New Career/Service

Opportunities Open

By HARRIETT HODGES
Staff Writer

The Career/Service program
offers ‘tas exciting an _ off-
campus learning opportunity as
any student could hope to
have,” according to Career/
Service Director Randall R.
Kincaid Jr.
~ Several new positions are now
available to students through
the Career/Service program.

One such option is an
internship with the Citizens
Committee on Population
Growth in the American
Future. This organization seeks
an intern for Winter or Spring
Term.

“They have an intern working
for them currently and are
seeking a replacement for her,”
Kincaid said.

“She is doing a study of
illegitimacy laws and
motivations of mothers of
illegitimate children. This work
would certainly be worth the
time of any student.”

Another opportunity = is
available through the
Smithsonian Institute. ‘They
are interested in having
students to work with them,"
Kincaid explained.

The Smithsonian is deeply
committed to giving students
meaningful and worth while

work projects,"’ he said.

The Department of State
offers an opportunity for
students to learn more about

the governmental foreign
affairs process, according to
Kincaid.

Participants in this program
will spend three months
working with officials in the
Department of State and
related agencies such as the
Peace Corps and the United
States Information Agency.

Further options for students
at the present time include the
possibility of an internship with

Sen. William Brock of
Tennessee and work with
Federal Reserve Banks in

several Southern cities.

Kincaid emphasized that
these are only a few examples
of opportunities open to
students.

“While they are open now to
students, there are many other
opportunities that can be
tailored to individual needs of
students,” he said.

Anyone who wants to do
something in Career/Service
not covered by _ these
opportunities is invited to come
by and discuss his interests.”
