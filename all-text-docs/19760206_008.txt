Mitchell concert plugs new songs

By CATHY LANDIS
and
RICK MILLER

Joni Mitchell should be working in
bars, or at least Offee shops. But
bars and coffee shops do not pay. The
Charlotte Coliseum does. Saturday,
January 31, Joni Mitchell appeared
for her share.

The concert began at 8:15 pm with
the L.A. Express, Mitchell’s back-up
band playing too loud and too long.
The group specializes in their own
version of progressive jazz which
somehow falls short of the Chick
Corea tradition. One reason for their
lack of finesse could be the absence of
Tom Scott, the lead saxophonist, and
Larry Nasy, the regular keyboard
specialist.

Mitchell appeared one hour later
with ‘‘Help Me’’, her only song to
reach the Top 40 chart. She continued
with songs such as ‘‘Cold Blue Steel
on. Sweet Fire’’, ‘‘For Free’’, ‘‘Rainy
Night House’’, and ‘‘Big Yellow
Taxi’.

But Mitchell stayed away from her
older releases in favor of the newest

ones. She played her entire new album
‘‘The Hissing of Summer Lawns’’.
The concert resembled more of a
plug for the new album than an
overview..of the Joni Mitchell reper-
toire. ~~‘

Mitchell’s sound combines a mix-
ture of folk and progressive ‘‘Califor-
nia jazz’’ with emphasis upon the
lyrics. Her clear and haunting voice
tackles a wide range but weakens on
the vibrato.

She accompanies herself on the
keyboard, dulcimer, and primarily the
guitar. Her guitar sound is innovative
specifically in regard to her tuning
style. She makes the songs dictate the
sound of the instrument rather than
the guitar controlling the song.

Of course such finer details could
only be heard from the front seat of
the Coliseum. The sound man missed
several cues, did not balance the
sound, played up the saxophone and
guitar to the expense of the bass.

The worst feature was the extreme
level of the volume, inconducive to
both ears and nerves. The Coliseum
aggrevated the condition by directing

least violinist who is considered the
most important member of the orch-
estra, of the New Haven Symphony
while her husband was in graduate
school at Yale. She played Concert
Master for the Charlotte Symphony
Orchestra when they came to David-
son.

Richey is a member of the Razou-
movski Quartet, with Sally Peck from
the School of the Arts on viola, Dave
Moskovitz from UNC-G on second
violin, and Robert Marsh, the prin-
ciple cellist of the Atlanta Symphony.
The quartet played 20 concerts last
year in eastern U.S., but, because of
personnel changes, has not played
this year.

“The quartet is just sheer pleas-
ure,’’ said Richey. “It’s very, very
hard work but the most fun I know.
It’s probably every string player’s
dream.

‘The thing to look for is people who
have styles and personalities you can
work with. These people work great—
our only problem is that we’re
separated by a geographical distance.
We get together whenever we can
spare the time and work in a very
concentrated way,’’ she continued.

Richey also plays solo recitals; she
is currently preparing for a sonata
recital with Bela Nagy at the School
of the arts.

The Richeys have three sons who
are all musicians. ‘In the evenings
when everybody’s practicing, it’s
wild. There’s usually three people
going at the same time.

She is not involved with the
Davidson community because, ‘‘My
music takes up all my time so I’m
lucky if I'm able to cook supper. I was
reading a quote from one of the
greatest musicians, ‘A musician’s
work is his hobby.’ If you really love
it you want to do it.”

McKelway teaches piano to college
students and faculty and to towns-
people. She takes no beginners but
finds all ranges of proficiency and
talent

“I just try to teach (my students)
to play the instrument the best they
can within the confines of their talent
and ability,’’ she said.

“T find teaching very frustrating at
times, but very satisfying. It depends
on the diligence of the students and
their interest. This pertains mostly to
younger students because the college
students don’t take unless they want
tore

McKelway majored in music at
Vassar and went to Vienna to study
under Walter Panhoffer at The Aca-
demy of Music and Performing Arts. °
She studied under Lydia Hoffmann-
Behrendt at Dartmouth after gradua-
ting from Vienna.

Although she studied for a teaching
degree, McKelway’s exams included
recitals. She gives recitals infrequent-
ly here, but is preparing for one with
Christine Ligo-and Donald Grant in
March. The trio plans to perform a
Brahms clarinet and piano sonata and
Schubert’s ‘Shepard on the Rocks’’
as part of the program.

McKelway belonged to a Master
Class, a group of students who play
for each other and then are evaluated
by the fellow students and the
instructor, in Charlotte last year. She
didn’t rejoin this year because she has
taken more students and doesn’t have
the time.

Besides her music, McKelway has
helped in elementary schools by
reading, and has worked with the
League of Women’s Voters on several
political campaigns. She helped found
and taught at the New Schoolhouse
for the Arts. In the summer she sails
on the Chesapeake Bay with her
family.

Her music takes up most of her
time now. ‘‘As I’ve gotten more
involved in teaching and playing for
myself I’ve not done as much. The
more you get into the thing you want
to do the more time consuming it
gets,”’ said McKelway.

“It’s sort of a perfect situation the
way I have it now. I can organize my
time to suit my schedule, my family’s
and my students’,” she continued.

JONI MITCHELL performed Satur-

day in the Charlotte Coliseum.

all of the sound straight forward to
leave the sides in an indistinguishable
dim of static.

The Coliseum also erected an
unnecessary black curtain which
cheated the side seats further. If
Mitchell took two steps backward she
disappeared from their sight.

Even from the center seats, the
view of the singer at a distance was no
more than a-red blotch of clothes, a
white face, with a little hair coming
down.

The light, too, was inconsistent and
unorganized. They couldn’t make up
their minds between red, green, blue,

white, or yellow. Even the Davidson
technical crew could have done better.

Even so, the audience was receptive
considering that, as Mitchell herself
commented, this part of the country
is a ‘‘hot bed for old tunes.’’ The
concert started out with the rowdy
atmosphere of a packed house. But as
the performance lost vitality, the
crowd dwindled.

Unfortunately they missed a resur-
rected ending. She picked up a fur boa
and cut immediately into ‘‘Raised on
Robbery” and the crowd broke loose.
She encored with ‘‘Twisted,”’ finish-
ing the concert at 11:15 pm. |

Writhing hero seizes
implement of freedom

By JACK GOLDEN
Staff Writer

The pressure on the back of his
neck grew more painful by the second.
The hands’ long jagged nails ripped
his flesh like shards of glass.
Writhing with the ever increasing
pain, he tried to give voice to his
suffering. Only the slight rasp of his
attacker’s breath could be heard over
the creaking of the ship.

With the agony rapidly growing his
hands shot out along the rail. There
must be something he could do to rid
himself of this fiend. He found the
answer in a large wooden dowel. His
hands seem to take on a life of their
own as they inched toward.

The pain made each second pass as
though they were hours. Finally he
clasped the implement of freedom and
with a strength he did not know he
possessed, he turned and struck the
vacant air which surrounded him.
