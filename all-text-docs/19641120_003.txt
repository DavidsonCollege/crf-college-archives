FROM THE BACK OF THE BUS

An Appeal For Apathy:
“Tie That UnitesCollege”’

By CHARLES RAMBERG
Davidsonian Associate Editor

The halimark of the student is his apathy.

By the consensus of the frustrated crusaders who
would have us change our ways, our favorite expression

is “I don't give a damn.”

We can’t be bothered by controversies, whether
they center on consumption of alcohol or constraints on

professors.

Apathy is the cardinal sin in our Christian commun-
ity of learning. Committment is the prime virtue. So we
have been told since we first arrived on campus.

The evaluation is faulty. In truth, it is the altar of
apathy at which we should worship, and spurn the cru-
saders. That apathy is virtuous is not difficult to prove.

First, it is a tradition. This fact alone should assure
us that apathy is good. For those who will not accept this
self-evident truth, another convincing argument for the
virtue of apathy is easy to find.

Apathy is the mortar that binds the blocks of our
community together. It supplies both the lubrication and
inertia to keep the wheels turning.

Without apathy to cement into inactivity the con-
flicting interests—students,

faculty, Trustees—of our

community, it might soon fly apart at the seams. Apathy

is not limited to students.

The present. situation, made safe by apathy is the

best of all possible worlds.

The Trustees can tell the world that ‘Davidson Col-
lege is opposed as a matter of principle to the use of al-
coholic beverages by students.”

To Hell with their principle. We are well.aware that
we can keep and consume aicoholic beverages almost at
will. Except for those unfortunate student body officers
who are honor-bound to enforce the drinking rule, stu-

dent enforcement is a joke.

The dorm cocktail parties continue and the only

ones hurt are thcye occasional students who are caught.

Davidson College is a Christian college. It must be.

Let the Trustees rejoice. Don’t let them Jook into the

Of course Davidson is a Christian college. It requires
professors to affirm their Christian committment by tak-
ing an_ oath. The college is a teaching arm of the church,

the Trustees say with pride.

Some hotheads may claim that the Trustees have at
least partially succeeded in fulfilling their proud boast.
But their argument is weak, being based on the probable

effect of avowedly non-Christian professors who have

never come here.

The hotheads are wrong. We study for four years

under men who are

ledged to “teach so as to give ex-

pression to the Christian faith . . .”

We emerge with a well-developed distaste for or-

ganized religion, some of us atheists who came only in
doubt, others not caring to hear more about the “ulti-

mate” religious questions.
That the oath is good

should not be doubted.

keeps the Trustees complacent. It has fostered a situation
in which many -of us manage to elude religion’s grasp.

Martin Opens Attack On Greek Defenses

Dear Editor:

It’s a bad situation. We
admit it. Now come on
boy’s let’s get together and.
see if we can't make the
best of the bad situation.

Every argument presented
so far by the [fraternity major-
ity can be summed up in that
statement. There's a hint, of
compassion there. In ‘the back
of their minds they feel a little
guilty for the ‘‘plight’ of the
poor Independent. This is the
bad situation as they see it,
pure and simple. The 15 percent:
the 20 percent, the 27 percent,
the 40 percent, or whatever it
might be a couple of years from
now is just not getting in on
the fun.

What's more, they might have
a few little permanent. injuries
done to their personalities
through the stigma the, frater-
nities might have placed on
them through their rejection.
Permanent injuries are bad
things and-so is an empty social
life and it surely would be nice
if we could do something to help
them. out.

It’s sort of like the race preb-
lem, though. First, these rejec-
tees have to show a little initia-
tive of their own before we do
anything for them (The impli-
cation here is that. they might
form some sort of rejectee clubs
or quasi-fraternities. or semi-
Greek houses or something).
Failing this, then probably the
government, i. e. the adminis-
tration will have to step in and
take the responsibility’ for the
welfare of these poor peopl
who don't measure up. ‘

The obese and buxom bridge set turned out en masse for the opera Tales of Hoff-

By JOHN McCLATCHEY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

man by Offenbach presented by the Charlotte Opera Association at Oven’s Audito-
rium. The ladies aids were accompanied by school teachers. college students at-
tempting to escape from the inevitable, transplanted long-hairs, and people who just
thought they would’enjoy an opera.

The opera itself was present-
ed probably as well as Char-
Jotte was capable of present-
ing it. The Charlotte Sym-
phony did an excellent job. but
often drowned out some of the
struggling singers.

On arriving at the auditorium
1 was impressed by the magnifi-
cent furnishings of the place.
The lobbies were carpeted with
lush red rugs which compli-
mented the blue walls. There
were several small sofas with
purple velveteen coverings and
various pieces of lawn furniture
placed at intervals around the
walls. Behind the bar was a
“mural.’’ It consisted of cubic
and clashing shapes in reds and
yellows and oranges against
the biue. I suppose it represents
the clash of Charlotte with the
opera, for there were many
empty seats inside. The audi-
torium itself was very spacious
and blue. The acoustics seem-
ed to be excellent.

Once the opera started I busi-
ed myself in trying to identify
the members of the Male Chor:
us in the opening bar scene. I
was immediately reminded of
Hattie’s on Friday nights. They
did a good job portraying the
drinking and carousing of the
students. Hoffman, played by
William MacDonald of the New
York City Opera Company, soon
entered the bar and proceeded

to tell his three tales of Jost
love to his inebriated compan-
ions. I thought Mr. MacDonald's
voice was better than those of
the other professionals.

In ‘the first tale Hofffman
falls in love with an automaton,
which is constantly being wound
up while it sings to Hoffman.
But, alas, her owner is in debt
and the inescapable loan shark
arrives and smashes the col-
lateral, Hoffman’s love. In-
termission was called and I ad-
journed to the lobby.

During intermission I notic-
ed a great variety in dress of
those at the Opera. Many of
the women were immediately
recognizable as socialites by
their black or white gowns and
“Queen-Of-Heart” figures.

Some of the younger adults
looked as if they would really
have been enjoying themselves
if they hadn't been carrying
small out-of-place wax cups of

Coke. These people were dress-

ed rather unobtrusively in
suits and Sunday school dress-
es. The students were dressed
in sport coats, suits and Jong
hair. They were -immediately
identifiable by their small cli-
ques and pointing fingers of
scorn, as they attempted to hide
their own feelings of being sep-
arated from their element, (if
indeed they have one). A bell
rang, and I assumed that it

was Charlotte’s way. of telling
me to return to my seat. T did.

The next tale of Hoffman was
set in Venice, which was ob-
vious from the red Woolworth
backdrop. He falls in love with
a courtesan, who. encourages
his advances and then drifts
away with another lover in her
trusty gondola. There was an-
other intermission. and I made
essentially the same observa:
tions as before with the aid of
some Queen's girls.

The third tale followed, and
we had been transported to Mu-
nich. Hoffman's true love here
is a singer who is forbidden
to sing because of consump-
tion. An evil doctor (I could tell
he was evil when the stage
lighting went green) persuades
her to sing and she dies. The
opera closes at the bar again
with the Davidson Male Chorus
and Hoffman, who soon falls in-
to a drunken stupor.

It was enjoyable and fairly
well done. I found myself hop-
ing to be gone only a few times.
The most exciting part of the
opera was watching the people.
I would recommend the coming
production of Falstaff to you,
if only for a good exercise in
character analysis. And if you
are a seasoned opera goer and
above that sort of thing, the
production itself will probably
be good.

provides some consolation for

there: can be no solution to the
problem of the ‘forgotten mi-
nority” as long as any sem-
blance of the present system
remains, Probably presently the
well nigh heretical sophomore
rush itself would actually help
very litle. Any club based on
mutual rejections is completely
unsatisfactory, and rejection
would continue to haunt ts-even
after sephomore rush.

T will now try to ignore the
loud ho-hums of Schrader and
his cohorts and discuss the
question. with those who have
demonstrated greater ‘toncern.

LACK OF ASSOCIATION

Bob Young must feel some-
what disconcerted by now at
having his point so thoroughly
misunderstood by everyone. in-
cluding those who offered fair-
ly reasonable ideas last week
such as Art Ross, Rick von Un-
werth, and even Charlie Dibble.

Mr. Young's speech was not
based on compassion for the
minority. All of us realize the
futility of raising an issue on
that basis, especially in the
South. His concern is for the
good of the college, 100 percent
of it.

It’s just that the majority of
boys here are so thoroughly
wrapped up in what. they think
is a good thing that they see
nothing but a threat to their
present favored, protected posi-
Jon. The status quo is always
so warm and snug, especially
when the accent is on the
“‘status’’ in one’s own case, The
gist of Bob Young's speech in
chapel was that. the fraternity
system as it presently exists is
not consistent with the goals of
Davidson College as a school of
liberal arts.

No amount of IFC required
Reynolds .Lectures, minimum
grades, study periods, or spot
boxes will make up for what is
taken from the education pro-
cess by the fraternities. What
I am talking about is freedom
of association. or our lack of it.
I’m talking about the artificial
barriers. the unfair labels in
one case, stigmas in another,
which are created through these
superficial groups which some-
how have come to demand al-
most the same respect as God,
mother, and country.

LIMITED FRIENDSHIP

Do we really have more
friends because of the frater-
nity system? I think not. How
many potential friendships did

you see eliminated your fresh-
man year when you made that
great. second-semester pilgrim-
age to the fraternity houses?
And what is the basis of your
friendship now, whether your
buddy pays his dues, whether
you are able to get your rough
edges rounded off, rough edges
like not being able to talk cool
or failure to develop a_suffi-
ciently blase attitude toward
enough things?

1 admit that there is often
more to the fraternal bond than
this but I contend also that-those
who say that they have a’ wide
variety of guys at their house
are. fooling themselves. Should
this really happen there would
be a number of people wonder-
ing what went wrong. And what
really would happen as soon as
the ‘‘national’’ found out?

Do you ever have the oppor:
tunity to establish a‘ dialogue
over really worthwhile subjects

with someone. outside your fra-’

ternity who has something to
contribute or is it always cut
off prematurely because the
other. potential participant
never eats with you or never
dates with you and your group
frowns on his group anyway.
Do you ever feel: that you
would sometimes like to hear

some ideas of people a little bit'-

different from your's, but don't
quite get the chance? Wouldn't
education be best served
through some sort of system
where common intellectual in-
terests come first and common
superficialities come second?

“PROVINCIAL ENOUGH”

As it is, Davidson is a rare
breed among liberal arts col-
leges. Something must be wrong
when a person leaves with
more prejudices than he brings
in. Did you ever realize before
how many different kinds of
people you disliked, and within
your own race. at that? Coming
here, one freshman might be
prejudiced against the Kappa
Sig type guy while another
might know already he doesn't
like the SAE type individual and
another is positively scornful of
the Sig Ep breed.

Foor! aaa;
WALK THAT ACAN |
ai

Here at this Jittle school of
one thousand it is not too much

‘to. ask .that we be allowed en-
ough freedom of association to
discover that people are people
and not types. Goodness knows
we're provincial enough as it
is. Do we have to make it worse
by insulating ourselves even
against one another?

Is it really as bad as all that?
In support of my assertion 1
will say, that more than ohe
fraternity man has admitted to
me that his first responsibility
in the present debate is to his
fraternity. The unanimous argu-
ment. of fraternity men so far
in the issue bravely raised by
Bob Young has borne this out.

CONCESSION

One would think that with the
hundreds of different types of
social systems in the colleges of
the country and with the admil-
ied ills of our present setup.
there would be just one fraterni-
ty man willing to concede that
our system might just be all
wrong..

Can. vou imagine what sort of
citizens we. must be training
when we have people whose
scope is not large enough to in-
clude one thousand boys (or. a
mere 270). Where has freshman
class spirit been lately? Won't
their first allegiance when they
get out be to the West Side
Country Club. or the AMA. or
the NAM. or the NEA. or to
their state. of to their region,
of to their own race at the very
broadest? When the opportunity
arises won't they once again
offer foolish substitutes when
they see their own privileged
position being threatened?

What concrete proposals do I
have? Someone in a burst of
munificence has suggested that
the campus drinking restrict-
ions be repealed for Independ-
ents only. More seriously, I pro-
pose that Bob Young read his
speech to the student body once
again, and I ask that this time
they listen carefully. Maybe
then we can discuss the issues
as they really are.

So, if we are disappointed
because of dialogue, maybe it
is because we have discovered
that “politics” wasn't quite on
the level we thought. or really
what we had imagined it to be.

The first two parts of the
series were: (1) a preparation
of the students on issues; and
(2) Nstening to and meeting
actual political figures repre-
senting both parties.

Triffin Patterson. and Col.
Miller were the speakers for the

which the campaign centered,

Mitchell. Harry Golden and Ran-

ond part. and each gave a-talk
on party views, as tempered by
their own.

All represented an amazingly
consistent reflection of their
party’s proposal, and gave. as-
pects of the issues and cam-
paign that might not otherwise

son.

Jonas. Randolph. Wilson, and
Golden all touched upon some
economic aspects, especially

cific programs. Mitchell and
Babcock gave the reasons for a

The expectations of the liberal

be made clearer during the
third part of the series by Dr.
Link's analysis of historical im-
plications of the election on tne
conservative and liberal .move-
‘ments in America's history, es-

Looking back, we see these,

Irreducible Complexity:
The Davidson Paradoxes

By MICHEL DURAND
Richardson Scholar from France, 1964-65
The United States, or at least Davidson, is a curious
paradox of irreducible complexes and of qualities which
on the contrary show a pleasant open-mindedness.

Start speaking of politics or
economics to an American stu-
dent: the conversation becomes
more and more interesting . . .
until the moment when you
make. the stupid and. forgivable
mistake of uttering the word
“Socialism” or, what is worse
still, ‘“Communism’’, Silence
prevails, for these Words are a
curtain of iron about which
everything has been definitely
said. and against which even
the most intelligent student
balks.

An American student can go
without drinking. or eating, (or

. Studying) for a long time:
he will not complain, But if. he
cannot go to the barber’s when
his hair is longer than four
inches, the ‘obsession’ begins,
Fortunately,. this obsession of
being “long-haired” will soon
erid if he has the happiness of
being enrolled in ROTC .

J e .

On the other hand. the quali-
ties of open-mindedness are
numerous in the Davidson stu-
dent. A very nice one is his
taste for humor. To like humor
involves acceptance of laughing
at oneself as well as at others;
and if the English already knew
how to smile at everybody, the
Americans know how to laugh
at everything.

@ e .
Between these two opposed
poles stand the “rules” of

the college, which govern or
wish to govern the student's
life. It is difficult after only
two months to say whether they
are the translation of a latent

hypocrisy or a backwardness
of several centuries.

It is strictly forbidden to
bring one drop of spirits on the
campus. Not long ago, two
Students were dismissed for
having left a bottle of liquor in
their car. And yet it is known
that the students go to drink, a
few hundreds of yards from the
campus. To have a reasonable
drink on the campus is certainly
worse {han getting drunk. up
the road!

- The presence at a service. on
Sundays in a church of David-
son is compulsory. And yet it
is known that not much time is
devoted to prayers in the last
yawning or laughing pews of
the chapel! It is also known
that a strip-tease show. not
far from the campus, has found
a faithful cult of students, and
that the reading of Playboy is
often the ritual which follows
the service.

pleasant. Of course, it is not
Socialism, or the hair, or the
Honor Court, or grace, or re-
ligious services, which can be
implicated, but the way they
are considered sincerely or of-
ficially on the campus. And
after all, it has been much
easier for me to draw up a pic- |
ture of the negative elements
than of the positive ones, cer-
tainly it is because the latter
are too numerous to be listed
in a picture!
