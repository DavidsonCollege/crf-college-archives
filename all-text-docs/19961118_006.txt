EVANSTON, IL —

A $20 bill now can cost $21,
or even more,

Six months ago, Cirrus and
other automated-teller machine
owners lifted their ban on surcharg-
ing ATM customers, opening the
door to extra costs for ATM users.

Under the new policy, banks
still can charge ATM users for
using someone else’s ATM. But
ATM users now also may be
charged by the bank that owns the
machine. That means ATM users
can be charged twice by two dif-
ferent banks for one transaction.

In a survey of 20 states re-
leased in October, the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group (PIRG)
disclosed that 23% of the 458
ATMs surveyed already are as-
sessing surcharges to non-account
holders — just six months after the
ban. was lifted on April 1. The
machine must notify the user of the
charge, which ranged from 25 cents
to $3.90, but average $1, accord-
ing to the survey.

In Illinois, only 11% of the

machines assessed charges, the
survey stated. But the Illinois
branch of the PIRG says that
doesn’t mean some state residents
aren’t losing money.

“Tf you’ re going to one of those
machines that charges all the time,
then you’ re getting charged 100%
of the time, not just 11% of the
time,” said Gloria Beach of the
PIRG’s Illinois branch.

At Northwestern University,
First Chicago owns most of the
ATMs on or near campus, includ-
ing the ones in Norris University
Center, outside Allison Hall, in the
Sports Pavilion and Aquatic Cen-
ter and in Burger King. Even stu-
dents using ATM cards from other
financial institutions are not
charged at these machines, as First
Chicago has yet to begin levying a
surcharge for machine use.

“(Using a WildCard at ATMs]
is much more convenient than my
credit union at home as far as get-
ting charged goes,” said NU senior

’ Jason Morris. “I must have lost at

least $15 or $20 on charges at
home.”

The banks that do charge are
facing the wrath of consumer
groups and national legislation to

More banks charging for ATMs,
and students are picking up the tab

halt the practice of syrcharging.

“Tt’s just greed,” U.S PIRG
representative Rick Trilsch said.
“They’re saying, “We just want to
line our pockets with consumers’
money.’”

Sen. Alfonse D’Amato (R-
NY) and other legislators have in-
troduced bills to stop the practice,
but Congress adjourned before'any
action was taken.

Until the government takes
action, Ruth Susswein of Bankcard
Holders of America said consum-

ers, especially students, should take

action.

“Always try touse your bank’s
ATM,” she said. “Also try to fig-
ure exactly how much [cash] you’ re
going to need so you don’t have to
keep going back.”

The more you go back, the
more the banks make. The bank-
ing industry could generate an ex-
tra $847 million in revenue if 23%
of ATMs assessed non-account
holders a$1 fee, according to PIRG
calculations.

“Banks are not hurting,” ,

Trilsch said. “Consumers are hurt-
ing. They’re paying $21 for a $20
bill.”
