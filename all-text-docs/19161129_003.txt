zine, December, 1915, has been included

THE AIM OF THE COLLEGE.

Numerous diagnoses of the trouble
with athletics in the various educational
institutions have been made and it is pos-
sible that President John Grier Hibben.
of Princeton, located a serious trouble
in his annual report made public Thurs-
day when he said that athletics are suf-
fering from an over-organized system of
coaching.

Dr. Hibben declares that the system
as it is now followed tends to make
puppets of the players. ‘It is quite ab-
surd,” he declares, “that the control of
the team in all preliminary games should
be in the hands of a body of men who
are relegated to the side lines when the
play is on. After all, it is an under-
graduate affair and the game should be
planned and played by undergraduates.”

To the average man the objection in
connection with the matter of coaching
would seem to be that coaching like the
rest of the svstem of athletics is over-
done. It is important that men who go
to college should leave college with
sovnd bodies, but that in the, average
college too much time and energy are
wasted in an effort to put out winning
athletic teams is certain.

What Dr. Hibben calls over-organi-
zation of coaching is just a specimen of
the over-organization of the whole busi-
ness of athletics. There is needed every-
where the cultivation of the feeling that
the big aim of a college should be to
turn out the maximum number of men
with trained minds and not to win the
greatest number of victories on the dia-
mond or on the gridiron. —Fx.

A SHELF OF BOOKS.

Mr. Andrew D. White. the noted
diplomat and statesman, and the first
president of Cornell University, has
compiled a list of »books which have
given him the most profit and abiding
pleasure. The list was made at the re-
quest of the Cornell Era for the pur-
pose of stimulating the interest of stu-
dents at Cornell University in good
reading.

Among the books which have _ in-
fluenced his life he places first the Bible.
Among the passages of the Bible which
he especially recommends are the grand-
er Psalms, the nobler portions of Isaiah.
and above all, the sixth chapter of
Micah; and in the New Testament, the
utterances ascribed to Jesus himself, of
which the Sermon on the Mount is su-
preme, with St. James’ definition of
“pure religion and undefiled,” and St.
Paul’s description of “charity.” He
says that in perfection of English diction
there is in the whole range of literature

nothing to surpass the story of Joseph
and his brethren.

As to the classic writers Dr. White
names in Greek the more striking parts
of the Iliad and of Thucydides, and in
Latin Caesar, Virgil, and above all, the
Odes of Horace, the Agricola and Ger-
mania of Tacitus and the letters of
Cicero.

In English the names from Shakes-
peare’s writings. “Hamlet,” “Julius
Caesar.” “Macbeth.” “Henry TV."
“Henry Vi" “A Midsummer Night's
Dream.” and on a lower plane, “As You
Like It.” “Much Ago About Nothing,”
“Twelfth Night and ‘The Merry
Wives of Windsor.”

From Milton he names ‘‘Comus,”
“Allegro.” “Penseroso.” —**Christmas
Hymn,” and above all the “Sonnets.”
He also recommends certain passages
from “Paradise Lost.” and from ‘“Sam-
son Agonistes.” From Milton's prose
he recommends “Speech for the Liberty
of Unlicensed Printing.”

After Milton he suggests Words-
worth's “Intimations of Immortality,”
and especially his “Sonnets.” Next he
names ‘Tennyson's “Memoriam.” Among
other English writings he suggests Sir
Henry Wooten's “Happy Life.” Grey's
“Elegy. Goldsmith's “Deserted Vil-
lage.” = Burns’ = “‘Cotter’s Saturday
Night” and “I'am o° Shanter,”’ Keat's
“Ode to a Grecian Urn.’ Bryant's
““Phanatopsis,” Lowell's | Massaccio™
and his “Biglow Papers.”

As to oratorical writings, Dr. White
says that the three greatest speeches in
the English language are: Daniel Web-
ster's “Reply to Hayne,” Burke's plea
for “The Conciliation of America,” and
“Abraham Lincoln’s “Address at Get-
tysburg.”

In fiction he gives the foremost place
to Walter Scott's “Quentin Durward,”
“Ivanhoe.” “Guy Mannering.” “Peveril
of the Peak.’ “Rob Rov.” “Kenil-
worth,” “Phe Monastery,” ‘The Ab-
bot.” “Count Robert of Paris” and ‘The
Talisman.”

In the list of modern English fiction
he selects “Thackeray's “Vanity Fair.”
“Phe Newcomes” and “Henry Es-
mond: Hawthorne's “Scarlet Letter ;”
Charles Reade’. “The Cloister and the
Hearth;" Eggleston's “Hoosier School-
master: Kingsley’s ‘Westward Ho,”
and in present fiction, Kipling’s books,
Zangwill’s Jewish novels, Countess Ar-
nim's’ “Elizabeth in) Her German
Garden.” and her other stories, and two
or three recent publications of W. D.
Howell's and Winston Churchill.

The best short stories in English, Dr.
White savs, are Mark ‘Twain's “Jump-
ing Frog.” and Bret Harte’s “Lack of
Roaring Camp" and “Outeasts of Poker
Flat.”

In French fiction he picks Victor
Hugo’s “Hunchback of Notre Dame.”
and as the best short story, Anatole
France's “Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard.”

The most profound and penetrating
historical novel in any language he con-
siders Anatole France’s “Les Dieux ont
Soif.”

In German he picks Lessing’s ‘Na-
than the Wise.” Goethe’s “Faust” and
Schiller’s great plays.

In the whole realm of historical fic-
tion, he savs: “T would name one ro-
mance which has seemed to me_ the
greatest ever written in anv language,
Manzoni’s ‘Promessi Sposi.’”

Dr. White also recommends Macau-
lay’s “Essays,” Carlyle’s writings and
Sidney Smith’s “Essays.” In the field of
biographies he favors Stanley's “Life of
Thomas Arnold” and the writings of
Goldwin Smith, and also suggests as es-
sav writers James Anthony Froude and
Matthew Arnold.

In the field of history and biography
Dr. White suggests Leckey’s “History
of Rationalism in Europe” and Guizot’s
“History of Civilization in France.” He

says the most: practical and attracive
“History of the United States” is that
by Schuler, and also recommends ““The
Life of Washington,” by Lodge, and
“Lincoln,” by Hay and Nicolay.

The best short book: of American his-
tory recently published, he says, is ‘’Vhe
Hundred Years of Peace.” by Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge.

In conclusion Dr. White suggests
David Starr Jordan’s book on the war
entitled ‘Phe Human Harvest.” the
Rev. Harry Fosdick’s “Phe Assurance
of Immortality.” and Moorefield Stor-
ey's “The Reform of Legal Prodecure.”
—New York Sun.

“A boy was told to write an essay on
the Seven Ages of Man. Not having
read As You Like It, he evolved this
out of his inner consciousness:

“When ne is voung, he thinks of the
bad things he will do when he grows
up; this is the age of innocence.

“When he is grown up, he does some
of them; this is the prime of life.

“When he is very old, he is sorry for
what he has done; this is dotage.

“But the space is more than gone.
Buy the book.”—Fx.

A TWO-EDGED WAIL.

Says an editorial in the Seattle Times:
“The superintendent of the Washing-
ton State prison says the dry law has so
cut down the number of convicts sent to
Walla Walla that unless it is repealed
pretty soon he won't have men to finish
the Pine Canyon road.”

‘This wail is amusing rather than pa-
thetic—as no doubt it is intended to be.
The State of Washington can well af-
ford to leave that read uncompleted if
that is necessary to securing a sober citi-
venship.

Ir is said that “Baltimore drinks up
the value of its real estate every twenty
or twenty-five years, and its personal
property every six or eight years.”

On that basis of calculation Washing-
ton will soon have enough to cover the
cost of State wide interlacing of auto
trails. - Ex.

“So that pretty canvasser sold you a
book, ch?” .

“No, she sold me a couple of smiles
and threw the book — in.”’—Louisville
Courier-Journal.
