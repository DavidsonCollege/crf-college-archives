the Staley speaker ‘‘the leading New
Testament scholar in the world."’ Dr.
Polley stressed Dr. Davies’ unique
methods of inquiry, employing Ra-
bbinical sources to illustrate New
Testament teachings.

‘He is a thorough scholar, using a
detailed analysis of the text,’’ said
Polley. Most important, though,
“he takes a highly complex issue,
makes it simple, and excites the
listener at the same time. I have

heard him speak on numerous occa-
sions, and each time I have come
away having learned something, and
highly enthused,’’ Polley continued.

NEW RIDING

Weightless and flying down a
Vermont hill in waist-deep powder
during the Christmas holidays, Dav-
idson Ski Club President Dean
Marshall tore the ligaments in ‘his
thumb.

When Marshall and the 27 other
club members who made the Vermost
trip returned, he conceded that every-
one is not injured on such trips.
‘Everybody doesn’t break bones—

stable stands placidly amid the stubble fields and wintry forests.

Dr. Davies “‘is very sensitive to
moral issues. The topic he will deal
with in the lecture series is crucial, the
current relationship between Chris-
tianity and Judaism, their interde-
pendence as well as differences,”’
Polley reported.

In addition to being a renowned
teacher, Dr. Davies is an accom-
plished author, having written eight
outstanding works. They are all
thoroughly researched, original, and
authoritative, according to Polley. He
is currently co-editing the Cambridge
History of Judaism.

Although a freshman, it did not
take Marshall very long to bolster the
faltering campus Ski Club. His enthu-
siasm has led to a drastic membership
increase, going from almost zero last
year to its present 50.

“Skiing gets into your blood. It’s
almost better than sex,”’ he said.

Other trips are presently being
planned to either Beech or Sugar
Mountain. Marshall encouraged any
students possibly interested in going
along to come to the club’s next
meeting.

Under guidance of Marshall and
ROTC Major Collins, the club hopes
to get a charter so that they will be
eligible to receive College funds. They
complain that their treasurer, Robert
Waller, presently does not have
anything to do.

Mark Hooper is club vice-president
and Bill Coward is secretary.

The classic art of horseback riding

=. may make its debut here this spring

through the generosity of Jim Ho-
ward and the hard work of many.

The school has yet to assume any
financial responsibility for ttiey'pro-
gram this year. Future financia@® help
will be predicated completely on the
pregram’s success.

Howard first conceived of convert-
ing his cattle barn and 350 acres when
looking for a way to develop his land
outside Cornelius.

He heard of Davidson’s possible
interest in establishing a school riding
program. He contacted Tom Cartmill,
athletic director, outlined his ideas,
and stepped out of the program.

Howard is reluctant to discuss his
involvement in the program, saying
that he does not wish to play an active
role.

He merely says, ‘‘I thought it
would be a nice combination.”

The program is being supported on
this end by the driving efforts of
Katherine Whitney, Sterling Martin,
Diane Brown, and many other dedi-
cated volunteers.

Although they have a free hand in
the operation of the stables, Howard
has stipulated the distribution of his
$5000 gift—$3000 towards acquisi-
tion of horses and $2000 towards tack
(riding equipment.)

While $5000 is not much for an
undertaking such as this, there are
other generous sources.

Woodlawn Stables in Alexandria,
Va., is donating a package deal of six
horses, six ponies and tack for 24
horses.

Thanks to their generosity, the
money from Howard may go.to fulfill
other urgent needs such as new tools,
grooming equipment and shoeing.

Althougn facilities now only acco-
modate 12 horses, Sterling Martin
forsees no difficulties in putting the
ponies out to pasture. They may sell
some or all of these ponies, but that
decision has not yet been made.

Several horses are at the stables

now. Most are gifts; two are pur-
chases.

Katherine Whitney and Diane
Brown were responsible for purchas-
ing these two ‘‘school’’ horses which
will be used especially for instruction

At this time involved students
volunteer one day a week to .go olit to”
the stables, feed the horses, exercise

_ them, clean their stalls, ete. ,
