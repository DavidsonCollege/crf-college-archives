"53 Rhodes
Competition

The announcement of the an-
nual competition for Rhodes
Scholarships to Oxford University
will undoubtedly be of interest to
Davidson students.

Davidson is justly proud of the
fact that ten of its graduates have
been selected as Rhodes Scholars.
Three of these were chosen during
the past four years. The ten are:
The Reverend Wilson P. Mills, '03;
the Reverend Benjamin R. Lacy,
06; Shelby T. McCloy, ‘18; the
Reverend J. McDowell Richards,
"22; Robert F. Davidson, ’23; Dean
Rusk, ‘31; Carleton B. Chapman,
96; Charles T. Davis, '50; Joseph
J. Murray, '51, and Hubert N. Can-
non, ‘83, who is now enroute to
Oxford to begin his first year as
a Rhodes Scholar.

This past record of Rhodes
Scholarship winners indicates
strongly that the Davidson product

Scholarship

has a better than average chance
in the scholarship competition, and
that according to size Davidson is
far ahead in the number of Rhodes
Scholarships that have been award-
ed to its students throughout the
years.

Dr. W. P. Cumming, chairman
of the local Rhodes Scholarship
Committee, announced today that
the applications of possible candi-
dates ‘must be in the hands of
state committees by October 31,
and emphasized that those in-
terested in the scholarships should
see him immediately since there
is considerable detail involved in
submitting an application. Dr.
Cunfming also added that all in-
formation available on Rhodes
Scholarships will be placed on re-

of prospective candidates,

SCABBARD & BLADE .
MEETS OCTOBER 3

Scabbard & Blade, national hon-
orary military society, will hold
its first meeting on Tuesday night,
October 13, in the Green Room
of the College Union. The meet-
ing, scheduled to begin at 7:15
p.m., has been called to discuss
sponsorship of a Scabbard & Blade
rifle team. Also plans for the fall
tap day will be made.

Tap day will be held in early
November with only seniors eligi-
ble for tapping. The spring tap
day will be open to rising seniors
as well as to seniors.

Buddy Lamon, president of
Scabbard and Blade, has been
selected as the delegate to the
National Scabbard & Blade Con-
vention and Leadership School to
be held in Cincinnati, Ohio, on No-
vember 19th, 20th, and 2ist. _

Maxin Assists Rains
In ‘Words and Music’

Jack Maxin, who assists Claude
Rains in his dramatic program of
“Words and Music” which is being
presented at D.C. on October 14,
is considered one of the most tal-
ented of the younger generation
of pianists.

Young Maxin was selected from
many excellent musicians to be
the participant in this program.
One of the numbers on the pro-
gram is the reciting of Tennyson's
“Enoch Arden” to music.

Born in Philadelphia on July
18th, 1929, and the youngest of
five children, Maxin begah piano
lessons at the age of six and two
years later played his first con-

Campus Magazine
Seeks Frosh Talent

By JOHN T. HARMON

Freshman writers will have their
chance to shine this fall for big-

ger and better awards than ever :

in the annual Seripts ‘n Pranks
Freshman Prose Contest, Editor
Alden Williams announced today.

Details of the annual competi-
tion, to be announced in the Octo-
ber issue of the magazine, include
the publication of the winning story
in a future number, plus “a cash
first award doubling last year’s.”
For the first time, he added,
awards will be given to the second
and third place manuscripts.

“In the past three years,” Wil-
liams stated, “contest winners have
come from both prose fiction and
non-fiction. The contest will be
judged by the Seripts ‘n Pranks
staff on the basis of artistic merit,
not veracity.”

Scripts ‘n Pranks’ fall issue,
slated for delivery toward the mid-
dle of October, will feature, he
said, the outstanding art work of
Executive Editor Don Mahy, be-
sides an all-star cast of junior and
sophomore veterans. Professor J.
Wilson McCutchan is faculty ad-
viser for the magazine.

Joint subscription prices for girl
friends and parents are under con-
sideration and will be announced
later. They are expected to run
well under the four-issue single
price of two dollars. The remain-
ing issues, which are to be pub-
lished in December, March, and
May, will present the subject mat-
ter that student bodies of the past
have liked best.

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N.C., FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 19538

~-ADS BLOOD IRIVE

BRITISH TO GRANT
U. 5. SCHOLARSHIPS

Beginning in the academic year
1954-55, twelve Marshal Scholar-
ships will be available for Ameri-
can graduate students wishing to
study at a British university.

The Marshall Scholarships have
been established by the British
government as a gesture of thanks
for Marshall Aid, in gratitude for
America’s generous and far-sighted
program for European recovery.

Twelve scholarships will be
granted annually, each for a two-
year period which may be extend-
ed to three. Eligible for competi-
tion are US. citizens, men or
women under the age of 28, and.
graduates of accredited U.S. col-
leges or universities. The scholar-
ships may be held at any British
university.

The value of each award will be
$1,540 a year, with an extra $560
a year for married men. This sum
will comfortably finance a year's
study at a British university, since
academic fees and living costs
are considerably less than in the
United . States. Transportation is
provided from home to the British
university and back.

Qualifications for the awards

{Continued On Page Four)

TICKET BROKERING

Danny | BY INDIVIDUALS

STOPPED BY I.F.C.

In @ move to curtail “brok-
ering’ of tickets by fraternity
men to independents, the In-
terfraternity Council on Wed-
nesday night passed a ruling re-
quiring independents to pur-
chase their tickets separately.
The tickets wilt be of a dif-
ferent color, and no inde-
pendent or member of the
Campus Club will be admitted
on a fraternity man’s member-
ship ticket.

This action was taken, an
IFC spokesman related, after
repeated attempts in the past
to stop the reselling of tickets
by fraternity men to inde-
pendents had failed. The re-
sale of a ticket by a fraternity
member eliminates one inde-
pendent who might heve
bought a ticket; thus the IFC
could not depend on any in-
dependent ticket seles, which
meant that the fraternities had
to be charged a somewhat
higher amount to cover the
expense of a big name band.

The Council expects band
prices to be appreciably high-
er this year, and accepted this
plen as s means of avoiding an
increase in fraternity assess-
ment. By this method, the dif-
ference in expense is expect-
ed to be covered by the sale
and fraternity men should

BAND FURNISHED
NEW FALL OUTFIT

For the past two years, Mr. Sat-
terfield, band director, and Mr.
Moore, head of the band, have
been planning the uniform which
the Davidson College marching
band will wear for the first time
at half time activities of the Da-
vidson vs. Presbyterian football
game.

The initiation of this uniform
will be one of the highlights of
the Homecoming Dance weekend.

The uniform is styled somewhat

similar to those used in the Yale
and other Ivy League bands. The
coats will be a dark red color
which will set off the light grey
pants. White buck shoes and black
ties will complete the new uni-
form.
The hats, which were so familiar
to the antiquated military uni-
forms, have been discarded as
have been the conventional pant
stripe. The drum majors will wear
a white coat of the same style.

The sixty members of the band
will have the honor of being the
first band in the South to wear
the new style in marching uni-
forms. As well as being stylish,
the uniforms are practical, for they
will be used for afternoon con-
certs.

DAVIDSON DEBATERS
SOON TO SELECT MEN
FOR FORENSIC TEAM

Davidson debating will get off to
an early start in October by rein-
troducing debates on the Davidson
campus. Official inter-squad de-
bates will be used to select teams
to attend intercollegiate debates.

Definite plans are being made
to attend three debate tourna-
ments this full: the Southern Re-
ginal Tau Kappa Alpha Tourna-
ment, Mercer University, Macon,
Ga.; the Agnes Scott Tournament,
Decatur, Ga.; and the University
of Florida Tournament at Gaines-
ville, Fla. '

The spring debating culminates
in tournaments at Georgetown
University in Washington, D.C.,
Mary Washington College in Vir-
ginia, Emory University in Atlanta,
Ga., and the South Atlantic Tour-
nament at Lenoir Rhyne College.

Tentative plans are being made
to send the top team or teams to
the West Point Eliminations which
is considered to be the stiffest de-
bate competition in the nation.

The debate topic for the '53-'54
season is Resolved: “That the
United States should adopt a pol-
icy of free trade.”

In the near future there will be
a meeting of all freshmen and up-
perclassmen interested in debat-
ing.

Again sponsoring the Davidson
debating will be -the Forensic
Council headed by Buddy Lamon.
The debate manager is Roy Davis.
All debaters are voting members
of the Forensic Council. Above

Student Committee
Selects Best Films

Among the many features of the
Davidson College Union this year,
will bé the presentation of various
films as selected by a newly ap-
pointed film committee. This com-
mittee is headed by Buddy Bechler,
and Royster Chamblee is acting
as chief operator.

The other members are Will
Terry, President of the Eumanean
Society; Bob Crutchfield, President
of the Philanthropic Society; Dr.
Spencer and Mr. Smith.

Since it is the purpose of this
committee to select films which
would be most interesting to the
student body, any suggestions con-
cerning this selection would be
appreciated.

THURSDAY, FRIDAY

OF COMING WEEK

“Gamma Globulin for Polio” is the slogan for the YMCA-
sponsored biood drive which opens next week when the Red
Cross bloodmobile returns to the campus. Red Cross person-
nel will be in Johnston Gym on both Thursday and Friday

from eleven until five to receive donors.

Three D.C. Alumni
Get Commissions

T. Henry Wilson, Marshall P.
James, Jr., and Gray W. Hampton,
Jr., all alumni of Davidson Col-
lege, were graduated from the
Navy’s only officer candidate
school on September 11.

These men were three of 180 to
exchange their white hats of en-
listed men for the gold trimmed
caps of the officers in the Navy's
Supply. Civil Engineering and
Medical Service Corps.

Henry Wilson of Morganton,
N. C., graduated with a B.S. de-
gree in English in 1951 from Da-
vidson. He was a member of Kap-
pa Sigma social fraternity.

Marshall P. James, an SAE from
Maxton, North Carolina, graduated
with a BS. degree in Economics.

Gray Hampton of Charlotte, re-
ceived from Davidson the B.S. de-
gree for Business Administration.
He was a member of Sigma Chi
social fraternity.

These men have just completed
a two-month indoctrination course
to familiarize them with the funda-
mentals and requirements of a
naval officer’s life.

Washington Study
Offered D.C. Students

Davidson has been added to a
list of representative universities
and colleges throughout the United
States which are now participat-
ing in the Washington Semester
program of American University
in Washingtnn, D.C.

The purpose of the program is
to allow members of the junior
class, interested in national or in-
ternational affairs, to spend their
spring semester in the nation’s
capital to receive special training
designed to acquaint them with the
practical problems of. government
at the same time that they are
carrying on certain classroom

Last year Davidson ranked
second among the nation’s colleges
and universities in the percentage
of students donating blood.

Although the Korean war has
stopped, the demand for plasma
has not deceased, for the number -
of wounded veterans requiring
transfusions is still great. More-
over, large amounts of blood must
be used in the preparation of
gamma _ globulin for the fight
against polio.

Next week’s drive is being spon-
sored by the YMCA with Cortez
Cooper and Frank Mitchener act-
ing as co-chairmen. The ROTC De-
partment wil] again cooperate fully
by furnishing personnel and equip-
ment.

Red Cross nurses and doctors
will attend the blood-taking process
which is absolutely painless.

Mecklenburg County’s quota for
this year is 12,500 pints. Five
thousand of these will be used
in the county’s hospitals during
the first six months; the balance
will be sent to a national blood
bank.

Sam Magill, YMCA secretary,
said that no one under 18 years
of age will be allowed to give
blood. This is a national restric-
tion. For those under 21 years
old, written permission from
parents must be shown before
blood may be given.

Mr. Magill said releases will be
sent to all the homes of this age
group by the YMCA. All the par-
ents have to do is to sign these
and send them back to the “Y”
here at school. These releases will
be on file by the time the mobile
unit arrives. .

Cooper said the main use
the blood will be put to is in the
preparation of gamma_ globulin.
This serum is used to combat the”
dreaded disease, infantile paralysis.

This is a relatively new medi-
cine, but its worth was proved this
summer during the polio out-
breaks that reached epidemic pro-
portions in East Tennessee, Ala-
bama, and North Carolina.

Other services the blood will
perform will be for veterans of
the Korean War, and for serum
albumen.

Court Should Loom Ominous To
An Unoriented Frosh Class Of ’57

Get that guy’s name! No cap?
No tag name? Impersonating an
upperclassman? Disrupting Lyman,
Kiser’s study hall? Send him to the
Court . . . Such are the scrutiniz-
ing comments that are heard
throughout the campi, as all eyes
are eagerly focused upon that
blushing bloom of unsuspecting
innocence, the freshman under the
red beanie.

From the close judgment of some
informed upperclassmen, David-
son’s 1957 class of characters has
not removed the high school atti-
tude from its demeanor and is
sadly wanting in the characteristics
of a true gentleman. Such wrongs
must be arighted. This year’s Court
of Control under the able and
ardent leadership of Judge Fred
Stowe holds the key that can un-
lock the door of learning for all
freshmen.

According to the Chief Judge,
more and more complaints are
pouring in from upper classmen,
and it appears that the court room
will have standing room only in its
first sessions. The eight champions
of gentlemanly justice that com-
pose the Court are not only well
qualified for their position ‘but
have many sound ideas ready to
put into use for the arighting of
freshman errors.

One of the two sophomores on
the Court is Jemes Shelton who
hails from Winston-Salem, N. C.
Jim is a member of Phi Delta
Theta fraternity, D Club, Beaver
Club and plays on the football

team. His major qualification for
this position is the experience he
gained at Marine boot camp this
summer. When asked for his opin-
ion of the class of ’57, he gathered
together his knowledge of Lilly's
English, chose his words carefully
and said: “I believe that they are
a group of the most insubordinate,
overbearing, cocky characters that
I have seen or heard of in my
short career.”

A senior member on the Court
is Dan McCall from Marion, N. C.
Mr. McCall is a member of Beta
Theta Pi fraternity, the D Club
and Beaver Club, vice president of
Sigma Delta Psi, and is also a
stalwart football player. Dan is
looking forward to a busy Court
year and has many constructive
methods for misguided freshmen.

One of the outstanding juniors
of the Court, Frank Mitchener,
blossomed out of the cotton plan-
tations of Sumner, Mississippi.
Frank, a member of Phi Delta
Theta, D Club and Beaver Club, is
one of Coach Pete Whittle’s lead-
ing cinder men. He was treasurer
of his sophomore class and is
scheduled to be one of the leaders
in the coming Y blood drive.

Another senior on the Court is
“Bantam” Bill Shipley who claims
Asheville, N.C., as his homebase.
Bill is a member of IFC, Sigma
Chi Fraternity, Sigma Delta Psi,
Honorary Fraternity Council and
is co-captain of the cross-country
team. When asked for his hallowed

“Sweet William” replied: “Spirited
but cocky. I believe that a good
remedy for this would be at least
two weeks on campus so they will
have a chance to integrate their
spirit with that of the whole
school.”

The other sophomore on the
Court is Diek Adams, formerly of
Charlotte, now residing in Cleve-
land, Ohio. Richard is a member
of Kappa Sigma fraternity, is sec-
retary-treasurer of the Beaver
Club, and is a first rate basket-
ball player. Dick believes that the
class of °57 is somewhat out of
hand, and “It’s going to be rough.”

Another junior member of the
court is Harry Petersen, a native
of Columbia, South Carolina.

Last but not least is Fred Stowe,
Chief Judge of the Court, who
comes from Belmont, N. C. This
is Fred’s third year on the Court,
and with this experience behind
him, he has shaped a few aims and
principles for this year’s panel of
judges. According to Chief Stowe,
“strict attendance and cheering at
all home games, especially the
freshman games,” will be a must.
He hopes to meet as often as possi-
ble in chapel and he hopes that
the whole program will be con-
structive. Fred is president of Sig-
ma Phi Epsilon fraternity, and a
member of the D Club and base-
ball team.

So the Court of Control has al-
ready begun, and freshman, walk
carefully, for the eyes of Davidson

thoughts on the freshman class,! are upon you.
