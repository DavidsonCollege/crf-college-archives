Christmas For The Collegian

Before Thanksgiving American
merchants began to gaily toot their
horns, heralding the coming of Christ
and advertising “good deals” for all
potential wise men.

The prematurity of this perennial
call to Santa Claus-dom is distressing,
to say the least. But, nevertheless, we
must now admit that Christmas is
upon us, with all its expected joys—
both real and inappropriate.

Christmas for the college man is
a time of brightly colored reunion
parties with old high school friends,
highlighted by éggnog and the seem-
ingly sad realization that you no long-
er have much in common with the old
“group.” The golden “leaders: aren’t
leaders any more; the home town
basketball team looks pitifully small;
Sally-next-door has a baby, and her
husband works the night shift in a
mill somewhere.

Education wears different clothes
at every school. The problems and
solutions, the worries and joys of life
at Davidson don’t seem to be shared
by George-at-UNC or Jeanie-at-Ole
Miss or Dave-at-Dickinson. We have
all been aged in different vats, and
there seems to be nothing to talk
about.

We from Davidson will brag
about our basketball team, make im-
plausible excuses for our miserable
football season, relate various embar-
rassing and eventful moments of
Homecoming, say nasty things about
the administration—just because it is
the administration, and generally
gripe about returning to the cold
greyness of a Davidson January, made
even more bitter by the ominous fact
of last-minute reviews and exams. But
does anyone really care? “After all,
we are different,” they say.

Christmas for the college stud-
ent is also a time of trying in vain to
be really a part of the family again.
Or, maybe, it is a time when. we rea-
lize that our relationship to our family
is not quite the same as it was before
we ventured off to college. Thomas
Wolfe's ‘you can’t go home again”

seems sadly appropriate. The love is
still there, the grass still needs cut-
ting, and there is still a crack in the
front steps, but the guest towels in
the bathroom are a silent reminder
that Davidson is “home.”

Christmas is many other things
for the college student. It is working
in a department store rush to earn
extra money and to avoid the uneasy
boredom of sitting at home. It is driv-
ing by the high schoo) at lunch hour
and feeling strangely grown-up. It
may be the careful observation of
faces and noises on a crowded Christ-
mas-Eve street. Or it may be taking
particular pride in buying something
extra nice for your mom, and paying
for it yourself.

Perhaps it will mean seemingly
unlimited time with a sweetheart or
loved one—time to spend too much
time with her, unconsciously trying to
make up for three months of going
to movies and being back on the
campus by midnight.

Christmas 1963, no matter how
gay. and joyous, will find us still cloth-
ed in a lingering shame and grief be-
cause of the world’s horror on No-
vember 22. Both human decency and
American democracy were dealt harsh
blows on that day. Christmas 1963
must find us thankful that our nation
survived this wound.

And, yet, despite our worries
about the future and the general pain
of growing up, .each of us knows the
happiness that is Christmas, and each
will leave Davidson next week expect-
ing to experience again this happi-
ness. For some, Christmas 1963 will
find its meaning in the events of
2000 years. ago. For others, Christmas
1963 will find expression in the giv-
ing of things material and of our-
selves. And, for many, Christmas 1963
will be a pure and simple enjoyment
of the proverbial “spirit” of Christ-
mas. °

And THE DAVIDSONIAN takes
this opportunity to wish for you all
a meaningful Christmas—in which-
ever way you choose to make it SO

The Spirit Of Christmas

A few weeks ago, Will Terry re-
ceived a letter from CARE, Inc. with
information concerning the anaesthe-
sia machine donated to the CARE/
MEDICO hospital at Lomphat, Cam-
bodia by the student body through
last year’s Christmas Gift Fund.

Although shipped from New
York on May 22, the machine still has
not arrived at its destination. How-
ever, this delay is not unusual in view
of the remoteness of Lomphat. “Allow
a couple of months to Saigon, Viet
Nam; another two weeks waiting
transshipment to Pnom Penh, Cam-
bodia (then consider briefly that Cam-
bodia suspended diplomatic relations
with Viet Nam two months ago which
should not, but may well, delay trans-
shipment); then, when the anaesthesia
machine finally arrives in Pnam Penh,
it still has a long and hard trip inland
via Koratie to Lomphat (which is in
the northwest corner of the country,
is unreachable by land six months out
of the year, and must normally re-
ceive all shipments by means of the
tortuous Mekong River route as far as
Strung-Treng, then through the Tonle
and Srepok Rivers to Lomphat.”

That’s a lot of trouble. But it
seems to us that this gift and the cir-
cumstances surrounding it illustrate

your willingness to give generously
wherever and whenever the need
arises, regardless of political circum-
stances.

One final note which might cause
us all some reflection in this Christ-
mas season is contained in the follow-
ing excerpt from a letter of the Cam-
bodian Prime Minister, Prince Noro-
dom Sihanouk: “I have had occasion
to appreciate CARE/MEDICO's effi-
cient and dedicated approach to the
task it has undertaken—particularly
in the course of my visit to the center
at Lomphat in April of last year—and
I'm personally of the opinion that aid
inspired solely by a desire to be of
service to the less privileged in coun-
tries equipping themselves as best
they may to play a-worthy part in the
modern world, can assist greatly in
bridging the gulf fixed between peo-
ples of different color, civilization and
creed by creating that feeling of uni-
versal brotherhood which is so urgent-
ly needed for the peaceful settlement
of international disputes. Thanking
you for the good work your organiza-

tion is doing on behalf of my people, :

I am yours very truly.

Secor On Commitment:
The Promise Not To Run

BY PHILIP B. SECOR
Asst. Prof. of Political Science

“Certainly the professors would share our grief. Perhaps they would have some

‘insight, ‘some consolation. They are men of learning, men of wisdom, Christian men

of commitment... Yet in the classroom we experienced even more frustration; for
most professors lectured as always as if nothing had happened. .. But we scream
hopelessly. . . If history, English, economics, and psychology have nothing to say, then
why go on pretending any longer? If men have commitment . . . now is the time to

express their commitment.”
This was the reaction of Joe
Howell, Davidson senior, YMCA
president and _ pre-theological
student in the Dec. 1 issue
of THE DAVIDSONIAN. This
was his reaction to the response
of his professors to the tragic
death of President Kennedy.
Certainly no one member of
the Davidson faculty, especial-
ly not a newcomer to that facul-
ty, can speak to Joe Howell's
demanding complaint for all or
any of his colleagues. So, what
I have to say now is only mv
own feeble attempt to respond.
I want to make this reply in
part because of my friendsh’y
for Joe and my high regard for
him. In a more genera! sense.
however, this is not a raply to
Joe at all but to the many stud-
ents for whom I suspect Joe

You have dropped your dusty

Why poetry, Joe? Would you
prefer something political
sciency? Shall I be “relevant?”
Something about government of
laws: the marvel of peaceful
succession of a new man to the
presidency; the effect of mur-
der on the political aspirations
of Barry Goldwater? How about
something on the history of

effectively articulated a deep
feeling of resentment and frus-
tration.

First, Joe, why does this re-
sponse come now, so long after
death and not on the morning
of the first day? Why do “com-
mited” men so often seem to go
about their business on the
mourning of the first day?
Thomas Hardy asked the ques-
tion and gave an answer.

“Why do I go on doing these
things?

Why not cease?

Is it. that you are yet in this
world of welterings

And unease,

And that, while so, mechani-
cal repetitions please?

When shall I leave off doing
these things?—

I quote scripture? Should I say
that time heals aH pain? The
king is dead, long live the king?
Hatred breeds self-destruction?

You tell me, Joe. Is man good
or evil? Can freedom and
authority ever be reconciled?
Does God care: Do history, Eng-
lish, economics, psychology, and
Christianity have any relevance
—in New York slums? in Bir-
mingham jails? on a Dallas
street? ‘

“Should we go on pretend-
ing?” you ask. Is it.a pretense?
Do we have a choice to pretend
or not to pretend? Indeed, “we
scream hopelessly.” Indeed, “if
men have commitment, now is
the time to express their com-
mitment.” The trouble is, Joe,
that we—you and IJ—each
scream hopelessly; we each seek

commitment and relevance. This
may be an unending hopeless-
ness or an unending search en-
nobled only by hope. I cannot
impose upon you my own small
scraps of belief tied to life, as
they are, only by thin and fra-
gile strands of relevance. The
comfort of certainty which I
spoon to children on Friday
and Saturday and Sunday, I
can’t give to you. You are a
member of an adult academic
community filled with sensitive
people who do lack answers,
who do struggle with fierce
doubts and agonize to believe
and relate.

I wish that I had more to
offer you. Inspiration, perhaps.
Some of the tools with which to
construct your own relevant
faith, perhaps. But if it is to be

only frustration, so be it. Much
of order, faith and even beauty
may be constructed on this
existential foundation.

If there is one positive re-
sponse (commitment) I am will-
ing to offer to the question of
the relevance of the Christian
academic profession to the
death of the president, it is
this. The search for knowledge
and relevance in a Christian
college is carried on within the
community of Christian love.
There may be no comforting and
relevant response from the
psychologist as psychologist
or from the historian as histor-
ian or from the English profes-
sor as English professor.

But there is—or certainly
there should be—a community
in which students and faculty

Europeans Mourn Death;
No President Rated Higher

Saturday, Nov. 23, was to be-
gin a weekend of reunion and
reminiscence for thtee Char-
lotteans (myself, my wife Sue
and Graham Allison) now study-
ing in England. But at 7 p.m.
Friday, the news was received
that President Kennedy had
been assassinated.

After two days, the great
enormity of this act has still
not fully registered in our
minds. We were stunned, and
we remain stunned. The three
of us spent the weekend hud-
dled- near a radio, perplexed
and wondering. For the first
time, we had felt a part of
universal grief.

One year in a foreign coun-
try has taught us more about
what it means to be an Ameri-,
can than all the fulminations of
our professional patriots on the
right could ever do. The Cu-
ban crisis showed that the fate
of the West. does rest ultimate-
ly in American hands, what-
ever our alliances, U.N. com-
mitment and proclamations of
multilateral dependence would
have the world believe.

The death of John Kennedy
demonstrated that the trust and

hope of the West had become
focused as well as in America,
in the man who was its Presi-
dent. It is not inappropriate
that the man who had awakened
the West to the collective na-
ture of its peril has been the
medium of a mutuality of suf-
fering and human sympathy
which has no historical parallel.
Never have so many people in
so many Jands shared so person-
ally a single moment in time.

That Kennedy had always
been more universally popular
abroad than he ever was at
home is well known; what no
one had anticipated was the
manner in which millions of
people — the great, the hum-
ble, the uninformed, the wise —
had placed part of their hope
for the future in the image of
this one man.

The response in Britain has
been profoundly moving: stran-
gers shyly approach Ameri-
cans in the street and express
their regrets; radio and televi-

sion programs were canceled
Friday and Saturday and re-
placed with somber music and
news announcements: the
American embassy and Air
Force bases were deluged with
calls from people expressing
sorrow: in Cambridge, each of
the college chapels had a com-
memorative service and college
sports events were canceled;
by Monday, one British news.
paper had raised over $5.000
by public subscription of not
more than $5 each for a statue
to commemorate the President,

In other nations, the response:
has been the same. Even East
German guards at Checkpoint
Charlie spontaneously lowered
their flag in deference to the
Stars and Stripes flying at half
mast across the Wall.

I dwell on these happenings
because it is important to know
what the figure of Kennedy
meant to Eurove. No other |
American President has ever
raised our prestige, our repu-
tation for reason, competence
and fairness quite so high.

Many in the South would not
share this asse.cment of Ken-
nedy, but they have not ‘seen
what his leadership has meant
to a Europe shaken by eight
years of bluster by Dulles, of
benign but fuzzy incompetence
by Eisenhower. Kennedy as a
statesman towered so far above
any other contemporary states-
man in the West, that our ad-
mirers in Europe fear that his
passing may cause a malevol-
ent vacuum in our capacity to
sustain peace.

The spontaneous sympathy
of Europe contrasts with a re-
port in the London press of
approval, even exultation by
some groups in the news at
Kennedy's death. I do not be-
lieve that this report is indica-
tive in the most superficial
sense of southern reaetion, but

‘it does demonstrate how the

irresponsible maundering of a
few misled bigoted men can
darken a region’s image.

Justly or unjustly. the fact
is that in much of the world
today, the South has become
anathema by the same stand-
ards of judgment which make
John Kennedy's death a trage-
dy and heartbreak.

alike with mutual and suppor-
tive respect, tolerance and love
pursue what they may never
achieve—knowledge which is
both true and relevant.

The poet, James Stephens,
posed the problem to which the
Christian college should offer
an answer.

“My enemy came nigh;

And I

Stared fiercely in his face:

My lips went writhing back in
a grimace,

And stern I watched him from
a narrowed eye:

Then as I turned away,

My enemy,

That bitter-heart, and savage,
said to me:

‘Some day, when this is past;
When all the arrows have

been cast;

We may ask one another why
we hate?

And fail to find a story to
relate:

It may seem to us, then, 2
mystery

That we could hate each
other —

Thus said he; and did not
turn away;

Waiting to hear what I might
have to say!

But I fled quickly; fearing,
if I stayed,

I might have kissed him as I
would a maid.”

All that I can give you, Joe,
as a teacher trying to be true
to Christian commitment within
an adult academic environ-
ment, is the promise not to run
away.
