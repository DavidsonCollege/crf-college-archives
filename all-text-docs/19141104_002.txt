D. C. ALUMNI EN GEORGIA.

——~/\

‘The members of the Davidson Col-!
lege Alumni Association of Georgia whe
live in Atlanta have been following their
custom of meeting informally for lunch
at the Ansley Hotel on the first Saturday
in each month. “The Association has
enrolled some forty or_ fifty members, '
about thirty of whom live in Atlanta.
At the monthly luncheons at no time |
have there been less than a dozen mem- |
bers present, and there are frequently |
twenty or more. ‘The classes from 1884
tu (org are represented, and the hour is
one of good fellowship, calling up tradi-
tions, stories old and new, and the whole;
being seasoned with a considerable
amount of ‘gibing.” !

A number of alumni from other parts
of the country have been present from
lime to time, among them being Small-
wood, '05; Hashagan, °07; and Egerton,

|

“oy, the latter being in Atlanta with the

South Carolina foot ball team as coach..

The Georgia Association is a regular,
Davidson organization, and every stu}
Jent and alumnus who is ever in Atlanta
on the date of its meeting will be wel-
-omed to a seat at the table.

The Georgia alumni are as enthusi-
astic and as loval as those elsewhere,
and, with the lessening of the stringency
of the S. f. A. A. rules, they haope scon|
to see some Davidson teams in this part |
of the country.
