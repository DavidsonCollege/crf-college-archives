The Perpetual Perpetrators have kept up their winning ways.
They are undefeated as are Bone, Skoal Brothers, and Eddie’s
Searchers (KA). Bone, a team which I left out of last week’s Top
Ten is my updated favorite to go all the way. They weren’t in
last weeks Top Ten for two reasons: 1) I didn’t know who they
were and 2) They hadn’t played any games yet. In any event,
they’ve got plenty of talent. Bone has a strong infield led by
Gifford Piercy. They also have good speed around the bases and
quite a few long-ball hitters.

Here’s this week’s Top Ten:

Terror-10, 4
George
‘Bucky’
Murrell

1) Bone 6) Bad Pikes
2) Perpetual Perpetrators 7) Off Again
3) Skoal Brothers 8) Old Men

4) Eddie’s Searchers
5) Pissin in the Wind

9) Not Quick Enough
10) Hosebag Hunters

Tournament _ State

Nationally ranked USC blanks Cats 9-0

By SCOTT BEAVER
Staff Writer

The Davidson men’s tennis
team continues to compile an
excellent record and presently
stands at 17-4. The team, as
Coach Jeff Frank earlier pre-
dicted, is ‘‘a force to be reck-
oned with in the conference.”’

The Wildcats suffered two
losses this past week, to N.C.
State (8-1) and to powerhouse
South Carolina (9-0). South
Carolina is currently ranked
eleventh in the nation and
sports a 22-2 record.

Number -four singles player
Rick Johnston was the only
winner in the match with N.C.
State. Johnston beat Andy
Wilkerson 7-6, 6-4. “We played
pretty well in the doubles, but
overall I wasn’t too pleased
with that match,” Frank com-
mented.

In other action, the Wildcats
took wins over UNCC, Win-
throp, and The Citadel this past
week.

Sickness continues to plague
the team. Frank said, ‘We're
having a really tough time with
viral pneumonia. It’s kept
Nicholas Petrou out of a lot of
matches, and a lot of other
players are having problems
with it, too.’

Substitutes: have played well

for Davidson this year. Frank

said that the experience these
players gain in competition is
constantly improving the depth
of the team. For example,
Frank pointed out, ‘‘In the
South Carelina match, Paul
Griffith, who filled in at number
six singles, took three games
from South Carolina’s number
six man.”

Elon College Invitational,

_ March 30-31, by four shots over

his nearest contender.Simmons,
who combined rounds of 68-73
for a one-under-par total of 141,
led the Wildcats to a strong
tenth-place team finish in a field
of 27 squads. After playing
most of his first round in a
complete downpour, in which he

shot his 68, Simmons said,
“This Cat ain’t afraid of water.”

Sophomore Tom Haller was
the next best Davidson finisher,
at 155, followed by Mark
Shogry, Mott McDonald, Rick
Jenkins, and Ed Imbrogro.

Coach Thom Cartmill said he -

was pleased with the finish,
noting that Davidson out-shot
Southern Conference rivals
Appalachian State and Western
Carolina.

The pervious week Davidson
handed Western Carolina a

decisisve defeat by 13 shots in a
match at Charlotte’s Raintree
course. Senior Mark Shogry led
the field with a three-over-par
74, while Simmons and Jenkins
each shot 78, followed by
McDonald with 80 and sopho-
more Bob Whalen with 84.

In their most recent outing,
the Wildcats lost to UNC.-
Charlotte by 11 shots overall in
a team match at Charlote
Country Club. In team matches

Davidson’s club sports sys-
tem is alive and kicking under
the direction of student-ath-
letes. Presently, ten different
club teams compete on an

Women end
track season

By JIM CROWE

The Davidson women’s track
team faced stiff competition on
its own home turf last weekend
in the annual Davidson Relays
meet. The squad placed ninth of
14 teams, placing in only two
events.

Team leader Marian Hill
came in fourth in the 3000 meter
run with a time of 10:56.95.
Hill was the only Davidson
woman to place in an individual
event.

The mile relay team, com-
posed of Diane Downing, Nancy
Stoudt, Barbara Ashley, and
Laura Hills, placed fifth with a
time of 4:28.42.

The two events left Davidson
with e.final score of six points.

Frostburg State College of -

Maryland won the women’s

division of the Relays.
The women’s team ends this

season with an 0-4 record.

intercollegiate level.

Club Sports Council Pres-
ident Alec Driskill said that
club sports are designed for
students ‘‘who don’t want to
play on the varsity level, but
who do want to play on an
organized team other than
IMAC.” Club teams, he added,

‘‘Don’t have the rigors of a:
varsity sport, with the constant

driving of a coach on the field.”

Club sports are funded by the
Activities Tax-Council and by
the personal expenditures of
team members.

Various club sports are
offered each season. The rugby
team, under the direction of
Tom Clark, has already com-
peted this spring against Bel-
mont Abbey and UNC-G, los-
ing both matches.

The lacrosse team, led by
Alex Evans, lost to Guilford
and Clemson, but won an
exciting 10-9 overtime decision

over Ferrum on Saturday. The
team faced Elon today.

Freshman Jeff Tyler and the
men’s soccer téam faced the
Davidson varsity squad and
came out only three goals down.
The team will play a Charlotte
club team on Saturday.

The men’s tennis team, for-
merly the Junior Varsity team,
is 2-9 for the season, having
beaten USC-Lancaster and Ca-
tawba. The group, organized by
Richard Davis, has four match-
es left on the schedule, in
cluding Wake Forest on Satur-
day.

The waterskiing team, with
leaders Dave Welchman and
Lee McCormick, has its first
meet on May 2.

The volleyball and women’s
soccer teams headed by Sandra
Davis and Stan Reed, respec-
tively, will compete this spring.

Football, equestrian, and wa-
ter polo teams compete in the
fall.
