Cattes win finale

By BOB PERZ
Staff Writer

The women’s basketball team
finished the season with a 62-61
win over Duke last Monday,
bringing their final record to
5-13.

The Wildcattes jumped out to
a quick lead 15-7, owing mainly
to the play of Nancy Brown.
Brown, starting her first game
of the year, played a tough
offensive game at the start, and
scored her evening’s total of 5
points in the first four minutes.

The Blue Devils managed to
tie the score late in the first half
and go ahead by one at the half,
30-29.

Duke came out at the second
half ready to play, but two
steals by the Davidson women
and two quick buckets put the
Lady Cattes ahead, 33-29.

-Davidson and Duke ex-
changed leads many times dur-
ing the second half, and it was
the consistent shooting of Don-
na Ferren who had 12 points for
the night and Sarah Womack
who finished with 10 that kept
the Cattes in the game.

- Both the defensive and of-
fensive boards were controlled
by Cindy Morrison (15 points)
who hauled down 13 rebounds
in the game, and Womack who
grabbed 12. The offensive re-
bounding by Morrison enabled
the Cattes to convert many

.-missed shots into buckets.

The big difference in the

- game was the number of fouls

on each team. Duke drew a total

of 2%:fouls, while Davidson had

only 15. This showed up in the
freé-throw department, with
Duke getting only 8 free-throws

“all night, while the Wildcattes

were at the charity line 31
times.

The game was finally won by
Davidson in a dramatic finish
with only six seconds left in the
game and the score tied 61-61.
Co-captain Beth Tanner drew a
foul while she drove the lane
and was awarded two shots.

Tanner, who had 18 points for
the night, stepped to the line
and missed the first shot.

“Thinking back on the tense

moment after the game Tanner
said, ‘‘When the first shot
missed, I knew the second was
in.’’ It was; and the women
came away ending the season on
a victorious note.

Last Saturday, in Greenville,
S.C., the women.also had a
game that was decided in the
last six seconds, but this time
they weren’t so lucky, and
Furman came away with the
victory, 64-62.

The Lady Cattes had beaten
Furman earlier in the year by 17
points, and started off like they
might do it again. However, the
Paladins came on strong in the
second part of the first half and
led by 11 at the intermission.

The women came back in the
second half, due to fine defen-
sive play by Anna Hutchinson
and Morrison, who denied Fur-
man when the going was tough.
The offensive end was picked up
by Womack, Ferren, and Tan-
ner, who had 18, 16, and 16
points, respectively. Ferren also
played tough on defense, com-
ing up with steals when they
were most needed.

The women will be losing
three people next year with the
graduation of Sally Bondurant,
Tanner, and Brown. The shoes
of Bondurant and Tanner will
be the hardest to fill, as a point
guard who can run the offense
will be sorely needed. The
women could also use some
height in the form of: newcom-
ers, as they were consistently
dwarfed on the court by many
taller teams.

Tanner summed up the sea-
son by saying, ‘‘The offense
worked well this year, with the
plays run consistently and with
more confidence than in the
past. It was necessary to move
the ball quickly around the
perimeter to get the outside
shot because of the height
disadvantage in the middle.”

Next year the Wildcattes
should have a fine showing with
the return of starters Morrison,
Ferren, and Womack. In order
to be a contender, however,
their first order of business will

be to find a good point guard
and a tall center.
