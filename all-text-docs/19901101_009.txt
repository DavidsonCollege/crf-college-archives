New Diet Pills: Wonder Drugs?

“T lost 20 pounds in 5 days!
You can, too -- with new Curba-
loss ...” Yeah, right. Don’t believe
anything you read about weight
loss methods in the back of maga-
zines.

There are a few prescribed
drugs available now which can
-induce weightloss, though not quite
as fast as their magazine counter-

. parts claim to do.

I believe that these drugs are
only prescribed for the morbidly
obese, however, so if you’re hop-
ing to miraculously drop your ex-
tra 10-20 pounds with them, dream
on.

However, here are some of
the new “wonder drugs” for the
nineties:

imitation. On Without a Net, we
give it a check plus. The second
criterion is the emotion and num-
ber of voice crackings in Bob’s
screaming fit. Bob gets a flat “B”.
Lastly, you.count the gallons of

only problem with this beautiful
version is that it is too short (about
eight minutes) for serious torren-

The highlight of the, disks, i is,

The disk does not sound the same
asthe show’s bootleg. It’s worse in
that the tumultuous crowd response
to Marsalis joining in and for his
jam in the song’s mid-section is
filtered out but in return you get to
hear everything that Branford is
doing. This includes Jerry’s cut-
ting him off with the “Redeemer”
verse. If you want to hear some
’ astounding music get a copy of the
entire Nassau show with Branford
Marsalis (Nassau Coliseum, 3/29/

boring as ever, sr, only this time you
hear it, the sound quality is a lot
better.
“Help>Slip>Franklin’s”
sounds really close to the one half
of you who have read this far heard

in Hampton last year (10/8/89).

There are no real highlights save
its tightness through the sometimes
frustrating “Slipknot.” Brent adds
excellent background vocals to
“Franklin’s” making me regret.a
little bit what I said about him
earlier. But then to shove it all the

Dexfenfluramine increases
the body’s amount of seratonin,
which is the neurotransmitter that
plays akey rolein appetite control.
It is available in Europe, but has
not been FDA-approved yet, and
probably won’t be for another 3
years.

Bromocriptine had originally
been FDA-approved to treat Park-
inson’s disease. This drug appar-
ently shuts down the body’s pro-
duction of fat as well.

Researchers didn’t think that
this was such a bad side effect for
adrug tohave, and a bromocriptine
pill has been developed for use
witha five-month program includ-
ing blood chemistry monitoring,
which costs the consumer $2000

way down my throat he sings (and
plays) a nice “Dear Mr. Fantasy”
right up until the end of the song
when he getsa little happy with the
buttons on his boards. “Fantasy”
ends the set, the two disks, and an
excellent and successful effort by
the Grateful Dead.

SHORT SHOW aeiiahie

_ Widespread Panic, Colonel Hamp~
“Byes of the World,” with Bran-'~
ford Marsalis (Mr. Renaissance).

tGnand the Aquarium Rescue Unit,
Hot Wax"
1313, 10/28/90.

“This place is packed,” said
the drummer of Hot Wax to the
bassist as they went to get a beer
after their last set. “Yeah,” he
replied,”We packed the house.”
“Let me give you a hint,” I said to
them, having just gotten a beer and
heading back to my spot, “They
didn’t come to see you!”

Hot Wax is not worthy of step-
ping on astage where Widespread

has set up. Yes they were ari open- =

ing band butthey recycled the same

to $3000.

Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a
hormone which reduces appetite.
Abnormally low levels of CCK
may be one cause of anorexia; high
levels may trigger bulimia.

The drug causes a temporary
loss of appetite when injected into
the bloodstream.

The problem with appetite-
suppressing drugs, including over-
the-counter ones like Acutrim
which are available now, is that
people usually do not overeat
simply because they are hungry.

Psychological needs to eat for
comfort or reward (or just because
food is within sight and tastes good)
are not going to be affected by an
appetite suppressant. ~

dazzled the house that Hot Wax
thought they had packed for an
intense forty minutes. Way too
short. The Unit was air tightand let
fly a variety of songs ina variety of
styles. I heard heavy country and
western influences mingling with
progressive: beats and rhythms
giving the band an eccentricity
matched only by “The Camper,”
Camper Van Beethoven. Instru-
mentation was also as odd as the
Camper’s; a dude named Matt
plucked an electric mandolin with
precision and soul. The bassist
deserves commendation for a)
keeping bassist Chip Petree’s
mouth agape their whole show, .
and, b) for not beating me into the ©
speakercabinet after I bumped into
him for the forty-third time during
Widespread’s set.

Widespread Panic, if they had
ever been in a slump, is out of it
now. Throughout the night they
jammed on and off with members
of the Aquarium Rescue Unit. The
show was short thanks to Hot Wax
taking up valuable time but while
it lasted it was excellent. “Space
Wrangler’ ” was the only weak tune
of the night besides a long, boring
jam with the aforesaid mandoliner,
Matt, but even it buried the needle
on the get-off meter. “Porch Song”

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19):
You can do anything, though it

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18):
Attention circles around dan-

Gemini (May 21-June 20):
You are much too cool for this
world. Wisdom, beauty, excel-
lence, triumph, and fame are in
your future. Just kidding.
Cancer (June 21-July 22):
Concentrate on sense of humor.
Really concentrate because you
don’t have one. Change your
underwear. Eat red meat. Melt
butter and drink it while it’s sail
scorching hot.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22):

Doors previously closed are now
bolted shut. Rejection is high-
lighted. Reputation is shot. Love
relationship is based only on a

disservice by covering “Cold Shot”

height by immersing oneself in a

ups for a “Pigeons” like I’ve never
heard and the song of the night,

good fifteen minutes. The closing
