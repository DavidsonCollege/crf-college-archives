THE DAVIDSONIAN

BACK PAGE INTERVIEW

etterman hosted

Hootie and the Blowfish on
Friday. But before ABC, the band

interviewed at Davidson.

What do you want to talk about?

Soni: Great soccer teams of the
1990’s.

How about musical influences?

Soni: Name one, everybody name
one.

Darius: Al Green, Otis Redding.
Dean: Wow. Wow was a great
band in “72.

Mark: Wham! Bow Wow Wow!
Darius: Great Video. She was one
of the hottest human beings ever to
walk the face of this Earth.

Dean: Led Zeppelin, Van Halen.
Soni: Reo Speedwagon, Kiss.
Mark: The Police, Pete Townsend.
The main thing about influences is
that it has to be understood that we
alllike alot of music, whichis why
a lot of different things can be
heard in our own music.

Dean: Our cyrrent influences are
so many. We could sit here for an
hour and list them and still go
home and say, “Oh, I forgot that

”

one.

What are your interests outside
of music?

Darius: We golf all the time.
Mark: We’re a golf rock band.
Darius: I’m the best of the four of
us.

Darius: Drinking, going out in Five
Points is a big hobby for Dean and
me.

Mark: Soni and I have dogs that we

like to play around with it. Ihave a

Rottweiler mixed with a Basset

Hound. His name is Ripken. He’s
named after Cal Ripken, the Balti-
more Orioles baseball player.
Soni: Risa is my dog; she got her
name from the Spanish word be-

cause she always makes us laugh.

She’s a lab.

When you were kids, what did
you want to grow up and do?

Darius: I wanted to be a rock star,
but when I got a little. older, I
decided I wanted to be a sports
announcer. My life-long dream
was to be the quarterback for the
‘Miami Dolphins, but I knew that
wasn’t going to happen.

Mark: I wanted to be a broad-
caster, too, but I always wanted to
bearock star. Then] wanted to be
a basketball player, but once I fig-
ured out how to play guitar, I fig-
ured that was a little more realistic.
I took a few lessons at first, but
most of what I know I learned just
from playing.

Soni: A professional athlete al-
ways had to be first. Soccermostly,
but when you're a kid, you play
every sport, so anything would have
been nice.

Dean: Sports first, but when I was

ten, I decided -I wanted to be in a
big band like Led Zeppelin, Van
Halen, or Kiss.

Where do you want to go with
Hootie and the Blowfish?

Darius: We’re happy to be where
we are, but it’s not where we want
to end up. I want us to be happy,
but never content because when
we get content, we feel like we’ ve
done everything we can do and if
we ever get like that, we’ ve lost the
point.

Mark: I want it so that we can keep
making music. Everything else we
do is based towards that goal.
Dean:‘That’s the bottom line, mak-
ing this our career and making the
career last. I’m not content with
being here, making it big and get-
ting out. I want a smooth transi-
tion, writing music for 20 years
and the touring and everything that
comes with it.

Mark: Our goal is to be on Ricki
Lake.

Darius: I’minlove with Ricki Lake.
I want to date Ricki Lake. Don't
put that in the article.

Soni: That’s how you can hook up

with her. She’ll read the article
and give you a call.

What was making the video like?

Darius: It was a lot more fun then
I thought it would be.

Dean: It was a little party. It’s like
getting 30 friends and family mem-
bers together and going out to a
barn and having fun all day.
Mark: It was like John Denver.
Darius: Every now and again, we
had to get out and sweat really hard
and put make-up on.

What’s on your minds now?

Dean: Things are great. Martin’s
on tonight, and then we’re on
Lettermen tomorrow, and thencol-
lege football on Saturday, and then
professional football on Sunday.
Soni: So there’s a lot’of good T.V.
Darius: Life is just incredible. The
only thing that sucks is that there is
a baseball strike right now.

How do you feel when people
- make fun of the band’s name?

Darius: It’s a name to be made fun
of; there’s nothing we can do about
it.

Mark: If we were serious about it,
we would have changed it long
ago.

Darius: I cringe when people call
me Hootie. That’s the worst thing
any one could do. I hate that pas-
sionately.

Hootie and the Blowfish. ~

_HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH
LIVE IN JOHNSTON GYM

Photo by Brandon Clarke

Sitting in the back of the band
bus, all four members of Hootie
and the Blowfish seemed calm.
Davidson was their first stop in
the their new tour bus ,and they
weren’t quite sure what to make
of the forty foot monstrosity when
only two of them own cars.

Beyond the jokes, the X-
Force comic books, the push-ups
while we all watched Martin, and
the funny stories about Columbia
and all of the local hang outs, a
serious side could be noted. I was

sitting with four guys who loved
life but knew also how much pain
was involved in living it/

The very title of their debut
release holds strong meaning.
"Cracked Rear View" comes from
aJohn Hiatt song. “It’s about look-
ing at life in the past, from the ;
perspective of acracked rear view

mirror. We felt that the description
applied since the album is the cul-
mination of the last four years on
the road, really just a page ripped
from our travel log and put into
song,” Mark explains.

Every song in their show told
a story, taught a lesson, or helped
them heal in some way. "Hold My
Hand" was written by Soni, who
says, “It’s a very optimistic song
which I guess is a terrible thing to
be in the 90’s. That’s what I get for
growing up in the 70’s.”

In "Hannah Jane," Darius sang
about his best friend’s wedding.
“Tt’s me acknowledging that our
relationship will never be the same
now that he has got other people to
worry about,” he offers.

Darius soul-searched in other
songs, too. In "Let Her Cry,” he
reversed gender roles to explore

; gious belief,” he explains.

‘ceed because

his own negative behavior. "I’m
Going Home" came after the re-
cent death of his mother. “I needed
some kind of emotional outlet. It
was a difficult period for me. I
kept asking God why he would
take somebody so young. It was
really confusing for someone like
me who grew up with strong reli-

With all of their music, their
direction is towards honesty.
Hootie and the Blowfish will suc-

hey are honest with
themselves, with others and-most
importantly-with their music. For
them, success will never be a plati-
num record ora fully-booked tour.
Success is trueness: crying on
stage, laughing on stage, and al-
ways knowing that there is room
for growth. Their approach is
sincere; never become vain or
bitter because there will always
be others who are greater or lesser
performers. Instead, they chal-
lenge themselves and their happi-
ness comes when they achieve
even the smallest success.

How did you meet?

Darius: The Dorm. Dean, Mark,
and I were in a dorm together. Soni
was in an athletic dorm, so we
didn’t meet him until later. He was
in another band.

Mark: Soni andI met through class.
I knew he was a drummer in a
band,

Soni: He looked up to me then. I
was his mentor.

Dean: Mark and I went to high
school together, but I didn’t really
know where he was going. We
were talking one day and figured it
out.

Are you staying in Columbia?

Everyone: Yes!
Darius: The rumors are grossly
wrong.

«

How does releasing a song work?

Dean: We sit down with about ten
people from the label and every-
one decides. They have a market-
ing strategy where they decide on

the single. If we said absolutely

“not, they wouldn’t do it, but we’d

have to have a good reason. We
know what we want, and they know
what they want; we go from there.

What do you like about the fame
right now, and what do you hate?

Darius: What fame? Maybe other
people see this fame thing, but I
don’t. Ican walk through a mall in
Columbia and not have anyone
talk to me.

Mark: I like that our music is obvi-
ously starting to relate to people.
Soni: I was at a carwash, and I had
a picture of the four of us with
President Clinton in my hand, and
you can see me, Darius, and Clin-
ton, and the guy points at Darius

_and says, “Isn’t that Hootie? The

guy from Hootie and the Blow-
fish? How did you get that?” Clas-
sic.

Do you have a pattern for
songwriting?

-obvious value.

Mark: Everyone brings in ideas
and we put songs together.

Dean: We all try to write on our
own and then we get together .
Darius: Jam. It’s great fun. It
doesn’t happen enough because
we just don’t have time.

Any closing thoughts?

Soni: I want to tell the people at
Davidson that they have a wonder-
ful school with a beautiful soccer
stadium. I wish the Final Four
would be here every year.

Mark: Spread the Hootie word.
And thanks a lot.

Paul Graham (road manager):

. There’s a certain togetherness at

Davidson that we’ve all noticed in
the last few hours. You are all in

’ this together, even though you have

different interests or different
friends, [haven’t seen that in other
places. There's a real strong sense
of togetherness here; it's a very
I amdire that
greatly.
