WDAV operating in ‘barely tolerable’ situation;
only able to use 50 per cent of its power

By MARK BARRETT
Asst. News Editor

In what WDAV’s new Radio
Director Ed McIntyre termed a
‘‘barely tolerable’’ situation,
WDAV has been broadcasting
at approximately 50 percent of
its full power capacity for the
past six weeks.

The power reduction, form
maximum transmitting. power
of 18,540 watts to approximate-
ly 9,270 watts, was made at the
request of Transco Corporation,
which owns the tower from
which WDAV’s signal is cur-
rently transmitted. Transco
complained WDAV'’s sighal at
full power interfered with their
microwave communications
from the same tower.

McIntyre explained since
WDAV was using the tower free
of charge, the College felt it had
no choice but to reduce
WDAV’s wattage. Plans are
uncertain as to when and how
WDAV’s signal will be returned
to full strength, according - to
McIntyre.

He noted that the power
reduction has resulted in fair to
poor-reception outside the im-
mediate Davidson area, but was
uncertain exactly how far
WDAV’s signal presently
reaches, ‘‘We are not
‘all of the areas we could be
reaching,’” he acknowledged.

McIntyre also announced the
station has hired a non-student
announcer and will soon add
new non-classical program-
ming.

Good reception in Charlotte,
McIntyre said, now depends on
the location of the listener, and
whether he has a good receiver
and a well-placed antenna.
McIntyre pointed out, however,
that, “Even before the power
reduction, our signal had not
been getting into Charlotte as
well as we would have liked.”

When asked about possible
steps to correct the problem,
McIntyre.said the College is
presently having a shield built
around Transco's microwave
equipment. He hopes. that will
end thé interference. He expects
the screen to be finished ‘‘within
a month at most.”

McIntyre did not guarantee

the shield would work, however,
saying,
thing we’re going to try. It’s
not asure thing. It might affect
the interference significantly,
but then again, it might not.
Radio is a tricky thing. We’
really don’t know what will
happen.”

He was uncertain what steps
would be taken if the shield was
unsuccessful in ending, or sig-
nificantly reducing, the inter-
ference.

“We're looking into a lot of
different possibilities, including
building a new tower,’’ he
added.

McIntyre said WDAV’s pro-
grams, to begin April 2, will
consist mostly of jazz and rock.
He stressed, however, that in
no way will the new programs
displace its present classical
programming, as the new shows
will not begin until after 10 pm,
WDAV’s current sign-off time.

McIntyre said the new pro-
grams came as a result of
listener and staff requests for
other types of music besides
classical. He also noted, ‘‘Espe-
cially since the demise of the
jazz programming of WRPL (a
Charlotte station), there seems
to be a market in this area for
jazz.”

The programs will be pro-
duced and.announced mostly by
students. Students working on
the shows will not be paid, and
will be required ‘to work a
certain minimum number of
paid hours before 10 pm broad-
casting classical music.

The new programs will con-
sist of seven different weekly
shows from 10 to 11 pm, and a

Sex ratio change won't mean much

As a result of a recent Trustee

decision to modify the sex-ratio

admissions policy for
freshmen, .a slightly. higher
percentage of freshmen women
will be on campus next year.
Administrators indicated
that the change to a 2 to 1 male

daily show from 11 pm until 1
am. The daily show, entitled
“Flip Sides,’’ is termed by
WDAV’s April program guide
“the jazz and rock alternative.”

Regina Scruggs, WDAV’s
new full-time non-student an-
nouncer, plans to begin work
about April 10, according to
McIntyre. She will then assume
her duties as chief announcer
which will involve 35 hours on
the air per week and ‘helping
train WDAV’s student announ-
cers.

She has an undergraduate
degree in music from Beloit

College in Wisconsin and had

done graduate work in music
theory at Northwestern Univer-
sity. McIntyre said she has
extensive experience in radio
and has been involved in a
college radio station.

McIntyre said she was hired
to upgrade WDAV’s announ-
cing quality, both through her
air time and her. training of
WDAV’s student announcers.

McIntyre also revealed that
WDAV had its first FCC in-
spection March 8 toward re-
ceiving final licensing. He. said
he felt, ‘‘We came through
rather well.”

WDAV is still operating un-
der program test authority from
the FCC, which gives it authori-
ty to broadcast until the FCC
has an opportunity to. further
examine its operations.

An FCC spokesman said
Tuesday that obtaining pro-
gram test authority is the major
hurdle in the licensing process
of a station. He called final
approval ‘‘90 percent formality,
unless irregularities are found.”

warned that the change from
2.3 to 1 does not represent a
trend to merit-based admis-
sions.

“I would say it is not a trend,
that it is just staying in line

‘with the original decision. It’s

not a change in Trustee policy
but it may be a change in
College practice,’’ said Dean of
Students Will Terry.

Cartmill reels

Bu RICK JENKINS
News Editor
A week after SGA presiden-
tial candidates John Jackson

-and Andy Miller recommended

the dismissal of Athletic Direc-
tor Thomas Cartmill, Cartmill
said, ‘‘I’m completely in the
dark and very much shocked
that they would seek a rather
important office at the expense
of someone's job without get-
ting the facts.”

Cartmill noted that. neither
candidate had talked with him
(during their campaigns) con-
cerning the state of the athletic
program.

Increased dissatifaction with
the job Cartmill is doing comes
at a time of discontent with
Davidson’s athletic program in
general, and ‘‘since Cartmill is
in charge, he is answerable,”
said recently-elected SGA Pre-
sident John Jackson.

Andy Miller, who as a mem-
ber of the SGA Athletic Com-
mittee has worked with Cartmill
this year, questioned Cartmill’s
competence. “‘His manner of
refusing is to say ‘yes’ and then
not do it,’’ Miller said of
Cartmill’s reliability on the job.
Miller said he thinks .some
coaches, student and faculty
will agree that Cartmill often
fails to fulfill his intentions.

Miller furnished one example
of a worn and frayed rope in the
weight room that he said was
not replaced until three months
after-Cartmill had signed the
work order.

Miller also questioned the
way Cartmill has handled the
athletic budget. ‘‘Another point
of irresponsibility is that in the
last three years the athletic
budget has wildly gone over its
appropriations,”’ he said. Miller
explained that while basketball
coach Dave Pritchett was here,
he overspent his appropriations
by approximately $100,000.
Miller thinks that as Pritchett’s
overseer, Cartmill can be held
accountable for this happening.

“The athletic be egal has been
ps mishandled. . .”’ Miller

Bee students, Miller ex-_
plained, have lately criticized
Cartmill for not releasing the
athletic budget. But this criti-
cism, said Cartmill, is not
legitimate because any figures
that are disclosed are done so by
College President Samuel Spen-

-cer and Academic Vice Presi-

dent Price Zimmermann. Even
though the decision to make
public Davidson’s athletic bud-
get is not Cartmill’s decision, he
nevertheless acknowledged, ‘‘I
have no objections to giving out

Update.

The basketball ticket imbrog-
lio this past winter was the
blatant instance of mismanage-
ment within the athletic ‘depart-
ment, according to Miller. Stu-
dents could pick up only their
own game ticket, upon presen-
tation of a College I.D. card,
starting at least several days
before the game. The old sys-
tem, however, permitted stu-
dents to pick up their own
tickets as well as those of
friends, so that ‘large groups
could sit together at the game.

It was a matter of conveni-
ence, Miller explained, to ope-
rate by this system. When the
athletic department decided to
change the procedure, ‘‘Cartmill
didn’t give us (the SGA Athle-
tic Committee) a solid reason
why any of that happened,’’
Miller said.

Seniors. Bill Barnett, Tim
Goodell, and Carl McPhail are
currently working to. have the
athletic program evaluated by
an outside consulting agency.
Goodell thought that the ath-
department could spend its
money more effectively.

‘‘We’re not after anyone’s
job,’’ Barnett said. He ex-
plained his position: ‘‘I am
primarily concerned with three
areas of the athletic program.
First, I am not sure that the
policies we (Davidson) are cur-
rently following are appropriate
for Davidson. Second, I am
concerned that the character
and academic ability of some of :
the recruited athletes seems to
be below that of the student
body as a whole. Third, I am
concerned that the personnel

back on par with the rest of the
College,’’ Barnett concluded.

Spencer said of the possibility
of hiring an outside consultant
to examine athletics, ‘‘It’s
something we’ve done in the
past with other departments
and could do in this instance.”

“It’s common practic—an

cer added.
