MILITARY INSTRUCTION
GIVEN BY NEW METHOD

‘Yoday if the day of the specialist.
Everyone must learn same one thing
well. So the drill here at Davidson is
following the plan ot having each ot the
officers conduct a special phase of the
military work,

Lieutenant Dwyer, the commander of
Company. A, has charge of the bayonet
exercise and is putting the men thru
some stiff drill in learning how to handle
their rifles in) bayenet combat. As’ the
bayonets are without scabbards it) was
deemed unwise to begin the instruction
with unsheathed points. Lots of spirit
is shown hy the soldiers as they come to
the position of “Com, guard.” All ate
finding this class very interesting and are
enjoying the diversion from: close order
drill. Before long itis expected that the
men will acquire the fighting attitude
and learn to be skillful with their points
and parries,

Lieutenant Candler, “B's” company
commander, is overseeing the close order
dritl, and under his | supervision — the
companies are executing the manual of
arins iff a snappy and precise manner,
More and more are they. becoming sol-
diers of military bearing with regularity
of pace and prompt obedience. to com-
mands.

Lieutenant Doverspike, the command:
er of Company C, is in charge of the
setting-up exercise. By his instruction
there are being developed some fine speci-
mens of physique. Muscles, long out
of use, have been brought into play and
are assuming the appearance of _ real
bumps of hard, pliable tissue. Some of
the men still are unable to keep the
cadence, but their number is constantly
decreasing. | “

The care and use of the rifle is being
taught by Lieutenant Sullivan, the rifle
instructor. If Daridsonian readers
could have a glimpse of the squads as
they bump their bruised shoulders and
wear out their arms in learning how to
handle their pieces in firing, what a treat
they would have! Position and aiming
drills are the program at present. Much
remains to be learned before good shoot-
in is to be developed. however.

Lieutenant McCormick, the adjutant,
has the command of Company D, and
under him this group is attaining effi-
ciency in their close order drill.

The companies follow a schedule each
day and thus are given instruction for
twenty-five minute periods by each officer.
The company commanders have reserved
fifteen minutes besides in which to be
with their respective companies for any
purpose they desire.

Under this new method Davidson will
rapidly become a military unit of con-
siderable strength and efficiency.

News was recently received by: Mr..
Robert Mayfield that his son, Harry
Mayfield, ex-’17. was gassed and is now
in a hospital in France. It was stated
that his injuries were very slight.

GLEE CLUB CONCERT
WAS A GREAT SUCCESS

The Glee Club concert last Saturday
evening at 8 o'clock drew a large crowd
to Shearer Hall, and, coming as it did,
after the football game, was very much
a success.

‘The program rendered was a delght-
ful one and furnished much entertain-
ment for its hearers. The concert was
started with “The Marseillaise” by the
club. the audience standing while it was
being sung. Well appropriate it was at
this time of great rejoicing and closer
union among the Allies, “This was fol-
lawed by a clarinet solo, “La Poloma,”
by ‘Thompson, with piano accompani-
ment by ‘Tremain. Much applause was
accorded. ‘he quartet, composed — of
Belk, first tenor; Morgan, second temas:
Shields, first bass; McGeachy, second
bass, acquitted itself remarkably — well
and in a wav which marked the men as
masters,

“Q) Davidson.” a laval Davidson song.
rendered by the club, created much ap
plause, captivating the spirit of | the au-
dience. Mention must be made of the
accompaniment of Shields and “Tremain,
alternately, at the piano, for they han-
dled themselves like veteran musicians.

The entertainment was interspersed
thruout by favorite snatches of arniy life.
and the “you got to pet up, you got to
yet up. you got to get up this morn-ing”’
clicited smiles from even the command-
ing: afticer. ~

Perhaps the farce of Cathey, the
comedian, was the hit of the evening. As
“black as an ace of spades” he was, and

his coming on the stage with a dilai-

dated mandolin case from which he drew
several bottles of yellow medicine, a zhiss
and a spoon, created the thought that a
darkey herb doctor was in our midst.
But not long did this surmise endure,
for he immediately produced a harp, and
placing half in his mouth, then, after
“vetting the tune” and placing the other
half in the glass. set forth on music bent.
The resulting “tune’ was ‘a pious hyn
and a medley of darkey songs; after
which he withdrew with a parting “jig”
dance and a shuffle of feet which would
turn a minstrel so green with envy that

one would think hin a chamelean, But
not oso fast. “Mer.” Cathey. “The
“darkey" was not to escape so easily.

The applause was nearly deafening and
the instigator’s grace so bewitching as to
ignite the risibles of the audience to
high pitch, Se after two faithful en-
cores "Mr." Cathey withdrew, never to
return as a “jig” dancer, much to his
hearers’ unfeigned disappointinent,

The fame of “Mr.” Cathey as
“darkev" was rivaled by a mock sermon
by Shields. “This farce and side-splitting
monolague was too indelibly impressed
into the minds of those present to war-
rant repetition here, Suffice it to say.
however, that this delivery was noisily
applauded and took well.

The deviation from the ridiculous to
the sober came with the rendeving of
“Recessional” by the club. ‘This: beau-
tiful song avas sung with much devout-
ness and was received in awe and sub-
limity from the first to the last note.

There was also a mandolin and guitar
trio by Shields, Inman and McQueen,
which called for three encores. the last
one heing “Over There,” rendered vivid-
Iv, and could Geo. M. Cohan have heard
it. he would have been glad that he was
its writer,

The club deserves much credit — for
this, their first concert. and each mem-
ber acquitted himself admirably, All in
all the audience was treated with a most
enjoyable entertainment, well worth the
small admission fee.

The program was as follows:

Finale,

THE UNIFORMS!

Rumor has succeeded ‘rumor ta the
effect that the uniforms iad arrived.
The majority of then were started by
the man who talks to the janitor on the
cupilo every night at midnight. “These
were furthered by Sam Brady with the
assistance of his associates in crime.
These rumors have always received wide
attention, being repeated nian times,
but with all chat there are no uniforms

The Davidsonian does wot print things
merely on rumor, so one ot its reporters
wis sent to interview Licutenant Den
nard and find out, it possible, the whys
and wherefores. ‘Vhe lieutenant ane‘

shipped ten days ago. hut that so far he
had not heard anvthing more at then,
