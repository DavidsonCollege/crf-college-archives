Williams stepping down as dean of faculty

By NARESH NAGELLA
News Editor

One week after losing its Di-
rector of Career Services, Davidson
will experience another change in
one of its top administrative posts.
Dean of Faculty Robert Williams
announced that he will retire from
that position and to return to teach-
ing.

Williams says he departs with
mixed emotions: “My feelings at
the prospect of leaving the adminis-
tration lie somewhere between Ri-
chard Nixon’s ‘You won’t have me
to kick around anymore’ and Mar-
tin Luther King’s “Free at last, free

at last, Great God Almighty, I’m
free at last.’ Enough is enough.”

He said the best part of his
decision is that he will only be say-
ing goodbye to a job, and not to his
friends in the college community.
Following a sabbatical year in 1998-
99, Williams will return to
Davidson. He will teach courses in
Russian history, the humanities, and
modern European intellectual his-
tory.

During his term, Williams has

-professionalized the faculty by ar-

ranging funding for and eventually
appointing a dozen named profes-
sorships, establishing a faculty ten-
ure committee, revising the faculty

hearings process, instituting a re-
view process for tenured professors
and for promotion to full professor,
adding a substantial number of
women to the faculty, reducing the
teaching load from six to five
courses annually, and offering fifth
year leaves of absences for assistant
professors. -

He also takes pride in having
nominated six faculty members who
have been honored as “Professors
of the Year” by the Council of the
Advancement and Support of Edu-
cation.

Williams also directed many
curricular revisions. He directed

Campus drug
policy changes

By NaresH NAGELLA
News Editor

One of the most talked about

changes. on campus. this year re-
gards the new drug policy. The
College has changed its methods of
making students aware of the its
guidelines. Also, it has strength-
ened the penalties for using or sell-
ing illegal drugs.

Resident Advisors
are being told to em-
phasize Davidson’s ©
drug policy during hall
meetings. The Redbook, which lists
all the rules and regulations stu-
dents must live under, has added
some 20 more pages addressing
drugs. And, finally, the overall
penalties for drug use have gotten
more punitive.

The pages added to the guide-
lines do not add extra College regu-
lations. They are simply a reprint-
ing of North Carolina state drug
laws, which every student must
obey.

The pages “were added because

. many students did not know they

would be subject to criminal penal-
ties and could be prosecuted (by the
state) despite the College’s atten-
tions,” RLO director Kurt Holmes
said.

Many students are wondering
what caused the shift in policy.

Primarily, the Campus Com-

mittee on Religious Life was re- *

sponsible for the stronger penalties.
Fhe committee, which is composed
of students and administrators, re-
views the policy each year. They
then send their recommendations
and changes to the college presi-

dent for final approval.

Last year, the committee felt
that previous policy’s lack of man-
datory suspension after the second
offense was too lenient.

“The council did vote in a
stricter policy,” council member and
SGA vice president Ann Harriot
Fisher said. “Any student caught
with drugs for a second time will

now be suspended
for at least one se-
mester.”
First-time of-
fenders have to go
through drug education or treatment
programs and are put on probation.

In some past cases, “there was
willful ignorance about the health
consequences and legal repercus-
sions regarding illegal drugs,” Dean
of Students Tom Shandley said.

Being a member of the college
community does not shield aperson
from state laws, fines, and penalties
regarding illegal drug use.

Regarding what might appear
as a stricter RLO anti-drug policy,
dealing with the banning of candles
and incense from all rooms, the rule
change does not have to do with
drugs. Instead, it stems from a past
incident where a candle fell over
and burned a coffee table in a senior
apartment.

RLO has instituted the ban to
avoid such fire hazards.

Finally, the College has seen
an increase in drug policy viola-
tions in the last couple of years. ‘

Both Shandley and Holmes
hope that the added emphasis about
the negative legal and physical con-
sequences of drug use will stem the
rise.

from trimesters to semesters. Mi-
nors, double majors, minus grades,
the writing center, new study abroad
programs, and the College’s first
courses in Chinese and Japanese
language instruction also began
during his term.

He says his successor will face
the challenge of finding adequate
space for the College’s teaching
needs, and maintaining the quality
of existing facilities. Other issues
include sorting out the implications
of information technology on cam-
pus, increasing faculty compensa-
tion, maintaining a proper constitu-
tional role of the faculty in an in-
