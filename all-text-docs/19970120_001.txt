SGA considers revision

of chartering process
IVCF debate sparked need for clarification

By Matruew Eiricu
Staff Writer

The SGA revisited the con-
tentious issue of the chartering of
student organizations at its meet-
ing last Tuesday when the Char-
ters and Bylaws Committee pre-
sented its proposal for revising the
chartering process.

The Senate tabled the pro-
posed changes and should vote on
the proposal this Tuesday.

The Charters and By-Laws
Committee, chaired by Sophomore
class president Ann Harriott Fisher,
revised and expanded the SGA
bylaws which outline the criteria

for receiving a charter from the
Senate.

The bylaws changes would re-
quire an organization to provide
the following information: its
name, a statement of purpose, lead-
ership, approximate membership,
“a constitution, bylaws, or other
governing documents” and “astate-
ment that the organization intends
to abide by Article I,A.2 of the
S.G.A. Bylaws and the nondis-
crimination policy of the college
as stated in the Official Record of
Davidson College.”

Article I.A.2 of the SGA By-
laws states, “All students have

Cable presents results of five-year financial

By Ann CuLp
Staff Writer

Dean of Admissions and Fi-
nancial Aid Nancy Cable pre-
sented a financial report to the
SGA on Tues-
day night with
the Financial
Aid Planning
Team'srecom-
mendations based on a study that
conducted over the past five years.

At $25,267 a year, Davidson
is not cheap. Cable and the Fac-
ulty Admission Committee have
the responsibility of making that
price tag affordable for students
admitted to Davidson. With one-
third of each class qualifying for
need-based financial aid, the fi-
nancial aid staff awarded
$13,260,470 in merit and need-
based aid in the 1995-96 year.

as expensive as Princeton and as
economical as state universities to
enroll a student body of academic
quality and diversity at Davidson.

“Other schools use perks like
giving away computers or an over-
abundance of loans and others have
a much higher endowment than
Davidson, so it is acomplex task to
attract the very most academically
qualified students here,” said stu-
dent representative to the Trustee
Admission Committee sophomore
Rives Moore.

As aresult of the complicated
problem, a variety of financial aid
strategies have been adopted.

“This is not a science, it’s re-
ally an art, and even done well
there’s a lot of unpredictability,”
said Cable.

During the 1980s, tuition costs
steadily grew while the annual rate
of financial aid alsoincreased each
year. For every 1% increase in

fees, the financial aid budget in-
creased 1.5% to keep Davidson
affordable. A committee was cre-
ated in 1988 that determined that
the tremendous growth in finan-
cial aid needed to be checked. In
1992, acommittee chaired by Pro-
fessor Homer Sutton deemed it
necessary to cap financial aid at
13.5% of Davidson’s operating
budget.

The committee predicted that
the cap would be reached in the
1997-98 year, but instead it was
reached in 1994. In addition to the
cap, it was recommended that the
college maintain its need-blind
admission policy, but no longer
could guarantee to meet 100% of
demonstrated need for each stu-
dent. A planning team was formed
to create a strategic plan to guide
financial aid. The product of the
Financial Aid Planning Team is a
report containing recommenda-

tions and concerns.

Members of the planning team
included Professor Cole Barton,
Vice President For Institutional
Advancement Toby Bethea, As-
sistant Dean of Admission and Fi-
nancial Aid Harrison Heil, Con-
troller Ed Kania, Director of Do-
nor Relations Meg Kimmel, Schol-
