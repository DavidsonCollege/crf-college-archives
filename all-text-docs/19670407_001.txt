Reynolds it
Lecture
Monday

Amiya Chakravarty, teacher,
author and authority on interna-
tional affairs. will present the
first of the year's Reynolds Lec-
tures in chapel Monday.

He is Professor Emeritus of
Comparative Oriental Religions
and Literature at Boston Uni-
versity and is currently Visiting
Professor in Religion at Smith
College. Northampton, Mass.

Chakravarty will be on cam-
pus both Monday and Tuesday
and will speak Monday evening
at 8:15 in Hodson Hall.

As an advisor. he has served
at the United Nations and was
friend and confidant of Mahat-
ma Gandhi and Rabindranath
Tagore. He also was an associ-
ate of Albert Schweitzer.

The UNESCO prize was
awarded Chakravarty in 1964 for
his travel book Chalo Jai. He
has written several volumes of
prose and poetry in the Bengali
language and recently edited
with new translations House-
Warming and Other Writings by
Tagore.

His major complaint was the
rush with which the paper is
published. ‘There's never a let-
up. That makes it sort of diffi-
cult to get the quality you want
—because you're so pushed.”’ he
added.

Asked about complaints that
the newspaper did not represent
the students. Lesesne replied
that he didn't think that his
viewpoint had represented a con-
sensus of the student body. but
that this was not to be expected.

“The student body through
Letters to the Editor has a voice.
The editorial policy of a paper is
set by the editor. not the read
ers. The editor is elected to set
policy,” he said.

“Just because it's ‘The News
And Editorial Voice Of The Da-
vidson College Student Body’
doesn’t mean it's supposed to
represent a consensus of the stu-
dent body." he added.

Lesense thought that what he
had accomplished for the college
was “to raise some issues, to
stimulate discussion.”

“The participation (of students
on THE DAVIDSONIAN) to me |
is astounding.” he said. ‘‘be-

10th consecutive semester that THE DAVIDSONIAN
has won the award.

On a scale demanding’ 3700 points for an All-

F'll coverage of news leads, depthful reporting

Americans are alcoholics. This

Discussing the problem of al-

night, Robert Davenport, dean
of students at St. Andrews, said
that ‘“‘the importance of. an in

which operates from Greens.
boro, committed itself for the
investment of $12,000 and $20.000
in local leadership projects. se-
lected and carried out by pro
gram fellows. and in summer
travel.

In instigating thé program. a
systematic examination of cer
tain information «vas made for
each member of the freshman
class. This included grade point
average for the first semester.
college board scores, hall coun
selor rating, faculty recommen.
dations and high school activi
ties which were thought to re-
veal leadership.

F.rom this information 67
promising freshmen who met
certain minimum ‘requirements
were chosen to receive a letter
of information and an applica-
tion form. Thirty one of these
freshmen applied for the pro-
gram by submitting two 400-500
word essays on assigned topics.

Of these 31 boys. there were
22 seiected bv the faculty mem
bers of the Richardson Fellows
Committee to attend a weekend
retreat for interviews and for
extensive personal contact with
a group of North Carolina men.

time director of the Richardson
Foundation of Greensboro.

These men and the 31 students
met with. the Davidson commit-
tee. composed of Dr. Charles
Ratliff, Dr. W. A. Workman, and
Dr. Locke White.

During the three day retreat
the 11 men. had the opportunity
to evaluate the students: in va-
rious aspects of life as well as
reviewing a composite folder on
each applicant. The retreat in-
cluded formal interviews: dis-
cussions, seminars and informal
talk during meals.

In discussing the weekend
George Penick said. “It was a
most exciting adventure because
it Offered contact with people in.
high offices and let you see what
they were like and what you
needed to do to achieve their
success. It was a fantastic view
of leadership!’

Franklin Anderson said, ‘‘Tt
was stimulating to say the least.
A lot of the fellows were a bit
skeptical of the idea when they
attended, but by the end of the
weekend everyone saw: the po-
tential value. of the program
and really wanted to be chosen.
I was impressed with the men
who were leaders because they
were effective in stimulating us
to be leaders.”

Early this year, the Richard-
son Foundation of Greensboro
appropriated between  $12.000
and $20,000 as an annual allot-
ment for Davidson College to
set up a. Richardson Fellows
Program here.

The. program is a three-vear
experimental project for devel-
oping leadership among mem-
hers of the freshman class.

The idea for such a program
came to the Richardson Foun-
dation and to Davidson from
