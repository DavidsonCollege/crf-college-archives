THE DAVIDSONIAN |

Celebration includes parade, dinner

By Jack Morse

Davidson — the College, the
athletic department, and the foot-
ball program — pulled out all the
stops Saturday in its Centennial
celebration. The main events in-

cluded a pre-game parade, a half-
time show honoring the school’s
gridiron greats, and a
commemmorative dinner in
Johnston Gym.

The parade — similar to the
ones traditionally held in conjunc-
tion with Homecoming many years
ago — started at 12:30 p.m. and
traveled down Main Street and Con-
cord Road, funneling into |
Richardson Field.

The caravan featured over 40
units. Cole Wyndham and Henry
Cathey, captains of the 1935 Wild-
cats, served as Grand Marshals.

More than 30 former football
captains were also present at the
parade, but they were not the only
sports figures featured.

Many mascots from teams
around the Charlotte area enter-
tained the younger fans before, dur-
ing, and after the contest.

Homer the Dragon, the Pied-
mont Boll Weevil, and the Hickory
Crawdad attended the parade: and
game, and even the popular Sir Purr
— the Panthers’ mascot — made a
late appearance.

Davidson’s so-called Fan of
the Century, Rock Deaton, rode on
a horse and buggy, and there were
several NASCAR show cars and
antique automobiles highlighting

the official stamp on 1997 as the
Centennial Season and to declare
Saturday, in particular, as Centen-
nial Day. Even College president
Bobby Vagt made an appearance in
an antique fire truck carrying the
game ball.

The excitement created by the
parade carried over to the game
itself, as the Wildcats jumped out to
a 42-0 halftime lead over Sewanee.

During an extended intermis-
sion, former football players were
honored on the field.

There were Southern Confer-

the event.

The town of Davidson was rep-
resented by Mayor Russell Knox,
who issued a proclamation to put

ence players of the year, Davidson
Hall of Famers, former captains,
and many members of the 1969
Tangerine Bowl squad, the only

“out a new story.

bowl team in school history — all
told, it was quite possibly the great-
est gathering of sports figures in
school history.

After winning 42-14 over
Sewanee, the team got a chance to
meet and greet former players at the
Centennial Dinner after the game.
Approximately 300 former players
attended the dinner in Johnston
Gym, which housed a total of 500
guests for the celebratory meal:

Both young and old shared sea-
soned stories and distant memories,
as the Centennial celebration repre-
sented a time to look back on 100
years of Davidson football.

And no one went home with-

his three-year career — freshmen

“The key to (the 1969) team
was the skill positions,” Rader said,

year’s edition looks like it could
challenge the mark.

“It’s the best team since I’ve
been here,” said Matt Matheney,
who captained the team in 1991 and
1992.

“They have more team speed,
and they look better, too,” he added,
referring to their new uniforms. “T
came in (freshman year) with 35
guys, and we were talented but we
weren’t very good. Then in my last
three years we went 15-13, and
we’re very good now.” *

One of Matheney’s best memo-

The 1969 team went to the Tangerine
Bowl, clinching the berth by beating
East Carolina 42-27 after trailing 27-0.

Mike Kelly, George Hannen, and
Mike Mikolayunas. ,

“Td have to say Mike Kelly,
who is still a close friend of mine,
was my favorite receiver,” Slade
said. “He was the best player on the
team.”

Slade’s most memorable ex-
perience from that year came in a
game that started much the same
way Saturday’s did — in blow-out
fashion.

But it didn’t end that way.

“We had a great comeback win
over East Carolina that clinched the
Tangerine Bowl berth,” he ex-
plained.

After falling behind 27-0 in the
second quarter, Slade led the Wild-
cats all the way,back to a 42-27
victory. At the time, it was the big-
gest comeback in NCAA football
history.

And it sent Slade’s squad into
Davidson history as the only team
ever to go to a bowl game. The
Wildcats faced an undeféated To-
ledo team in the Tangerine Bowl —
now the Citrus Bowl — losing the
contest 56-33 and finishing the sea-
son at 7-4.

No Davidson team since then
has won as many games, but this

ries came in the last game of his
football career, which the Wildcats
won over Centre College.

“We were down by one or two
with four minutes left,” he said. On
the gamewinning play, Matheney
was on the field as quarterback and
current secondary coach Richard
Howell ran the option.

“He stepped out of bounds
twice,” Matheney said. “Then he
ran into the end zone and the referee
signaled for a touchdown, so we
won the game.” _

Matheney started his career at
quarterback before moving to wide
receiver. He also walked onto the
basketball team for two years, and
is now a hoops assistant to coach
Bob McKillop. But his gridiron days
were the best.

“The single most important
thing I’ ve done in my life was play-
ing football at Davidson,” he said.
“There’s a bond there that you can’t
describe.”

That bond is why he, Slade,
Rader, Todd, and dozens of others
returned Saturday.

They came to celebrate a cen-
tury of football, and they were pleas-
antly surprised that the next 100
years is kicking off quite nicely.

“To come back from a goal down
was big forus,” Slagle said. “We didn’t
panic and the guys just kept playing
their positions, not rushing anything.

“We just beat last year’s confer-
ence champion and we’ ve already lost
to last year’s last place team (Citadel),”
Slagle added. “We just need to realize
that this one does not make our season,
it will help us build our season.”
