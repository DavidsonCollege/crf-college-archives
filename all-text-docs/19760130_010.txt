Just what is an ‘Eppa
Rixey’’? Whatever it is , it has
been around for four genera-
tions, and Eppa Rixey IV can
best be described as team
captain and center of the
Davidson basketball team.

Rixey reflects on Davidson scene

Described by Coach Brick-
les as almost ‘‘too nice a guy”’
to play basketball, the 6-9
senior has accomplished the
rare feat of combining the
demands of basketball at Dav-
idson with a pre-med major.

demics. You can do it but you
get C-pluses instead of B’s,
and during basketball season
it seems like all I do is
practice, sleep, and study,’’ he
said.

Recruited by 175 colleges
and universities, Rixey chose
Davidson over Indiana, Ken-
tucky, and Notre Dame and
other top schools.

“T really like the school...
especially the intimacy of the
campus. During your four
years here you get to know
everyone and it seems like a
more complete college educa-
tion.”’

Rixey has a penchant for
practical jokes when not play-
ing basketball or studying.
Much of his freshman year
was spent at the fourth floor
window of Sentelle with a
water balloon in one hand and
a bucket of water in the other.
As a hall counselor last year he
engineered a late night raid
that most coeds will remember
for a long time.

“We stole every toilet seat
from every girls dorm and
then ran them up the flag
pole. I’d have to say that was
the best practical joke I was
ever involved in,’’ he said.

As a freshman, Rixey’s
basketball career was critically
hampered by a severe shoulder
separation that required sur-
gery. The injury occured only

EPPA RIXEY in action.

‘a week before the first game of

the season and he feels that he

has completely recovered only

recently.

“It’s taken basically three
years to get over the injury to
the point where I can play and
feel confident with it,” he said.

Davidson has_ suffered
through a dismal season in
Rixey’s final year, but he is
still satisfied with the, overall
program and remains opti-
mistic about the final few
games.

“Of course I’m _ disap-
pointed, but we’ve tried hard
and it’s been one of my most
enjoyable seasons because the
team gets along so well and is
really close.

‘‘T also think we’ve got a
good shot at the Southern
Conference title. I don’t be-
lieve it’s so unrealistic...if we
get a couple of things going we
could really surprise some
people,” he added.

Rixey has played some of
the country’s top teams and
players like Marques Johnson,
Adrian Dantely and David
Thompson throughout his
Davidson career.

“After you get over the fact
that you are actually playing
against them and not watch-
ing them on T.V. it’s alright,”
Rixey. noted. ‘‘They aren’t

that different from other
‘teams--they just have more
talented players.”

Rixey holds the school re-
cord in the high jump and is an
accomplished hunter in addi-
tion to his basketball achieve-
ments. During his sophomore
year he spent nearly 300 hours
constructing an authentic flint
lock rifle.

The two people who have
impressed Eppa the most in
his four years are two who are
often the subject of others’
criticisms, Coach Bo Brickles
and Dr. Samuel Spencer.

“Dr. Spencer is wholly be-
hind the team and seems to be
totally involved in the school.
Granted, you can find fault
with anyone, especially when
all their decisions are out in
the open, but if you look closer
they have a great deal of good
things going for them.”

Rixey will either attend
dental school or go into busi-
ness with his father after
graduation.

He is highly optimistic a-
bout the future of Davidson
basketball.

“It’s gotta be a good future.
Tommy Dore, Hickert, Gerdy
and all the others have a lot of
talent and with some good
recruits this year we should
have a heck of a future.”
