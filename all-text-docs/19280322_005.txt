i \. f these men:
Unable to stand the pangs of con science | ATC! along with them. One o

which had haunted him for three weeks, an

gave the name of “Bryant,” and is said to

unknown thief and marauder on March 12th/ fit the description of the young man now be-

returned $2,000 worth of fraternity jewelry,
which he had stolen here on February 22nd
from J. F., Hundley, traveling representative
of a nationally-known jewelry manufactur-
ing firm. Detectives who have been at work
on the case for the past three weeks, were
unable to explain the sudden return of the

stolen property which they had been unable ;

to locate.

J. F. Hundley, jewelry salesman, visited
Davidson College on February 22nd with an
elaborate display of fraternity pins, rings,
watch chains and novelties. Throughout the
day and on into the evening he visited the
several fraternity houses on tbe local cam-
pus, soliciting orders for his wares. After
a busy day, he retired to the chapter house
of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity, of which he
is a member. It was after midnight before
he fell asleep, his jewelry packed away in
leather cases in a corner of the living room
on the floor beneath.

Sometime between midnight and morning
the house was entered, the jewelry cases
opened, and their contents spread about the
floor in order to enable the thief to more
carefully collect those items which met his
fancy. After what must have been an ex-
haustive inspection of the cases, $2,000 worth
of the more popular designs were removed by
the thief. Before leaving, the marauder
stopped to cut up an expensive divan and
otherwise damage the furnishings of the
house. Detectives who were employed to
locate the thief. found no clue as to his
identity.

The Davidson students, anxious to clear
the college of all complicity in the theft,
conducted a painstaking and detailed investi-
gation into the robbery. The Student Coun-
cil met throughout one entire day only to
convince itself that the thief was an outsider
and not a member of the local student body. |

Detectives were ready to give up in de-
spair last Monday morning, when one of the
members of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity
found a canvas sack, containing the jewelry,
on the porch of the chapter house. _ Mr.
Hundley, advised of the return of his prop-
erty, made a hurried trip to Davidson, and
declared that the jewelry was intact. Not a
single item was missing.

M. A. Abernethy, Southern Railway mas-
ter at Davidson, declares that on the morning
following the theft, two unidentified white
men requested him to express a suitcase for
them to Fort Mill, S.C. The suitcase being
in bad repair, however, Mr. Abernethy re-
fused to accept the parcel unless securely
tied with a heavy string. The young men
later in the morning called to tell him that
they had been unable to locate a suitable
string and that they would just carry the
