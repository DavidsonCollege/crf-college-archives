The Dauvidsonian

Drinking Finds Acceptance!':

By ED EMBREE

Staff Writer
Four out of eight Eas'ecn
colleges aad un versities polled
by THE DAVIDSONIAN have
some tpye of policy which per-
mis students to dr.nk alcoholic

beverages on campus.

The remain‘ng four colleges
and universities have rules pro-
hib:t:ng alcoholic censumpiion
which are loosely or not at all
enforced. Three of the ‘our
schools with drink:ng rules were
from the South.

A representative of the Har-
vard Crimson said that there
was no dr:nking rule whatsoever
despite the fact that a Massa-
chusexts state law states that
no one under 21 may possess
alcoholic beverages.

Hal Wilby. editor of the Am.
herst Student, stated. that offi-
cially the Amherst adm-n‘stra:
tion supports the above named
Massachusetts law but. that it
is not enforced cn the campus.

The college does noi, con.is-

cate alcoholic beverages found
-on the Campus, and beer is
usually served at school dances
over the mild object.ons ofthe
administration.

While. the fraternity houses
are owned by the college, they

‘a result'of a campaign by the

all have bars. Wilby stated that
unofficially the college admini-
strafon supported a change in
-the ex’sting state law.

Georgetown University Hoya
wr..er, Joel O'Brian comment-
ed that the university rule
agamnst alcoholic possession
and consumpt.on on campus
was recently dropped. The
change in policy followed a
period when the rule had not
ben enforced. O'Brian said
that there had been no appreci-
able damage to the dorms since
the rule change.

The editor of the George
Washington University Hatchet
also reported that the univer.
sity had recently changed its
tule. Alcohol:c beverages may
now be consumed provided
that a recognized campus or-
ganization requests permission
for serving the beverage. Al-
coholic beverages may only be
served by the caterer. Slater
Food Service. and with the per
mission of the organization’s
faculty advisor.

Liquor is kept by the male
students in their dorm rooms.
Since the fraternities dwn the.r
houses, they have not been
covered by previous rules about
consumption. The change in the

KENT GLADSTONE

Wreck Claims Life
Of Kent Gladstone

K. Kent Gladstone. 20. a
Davidson student who trans.

ferred to Guilford Coilege this
year, died early Dec. 28 in
Greensboro when his car hit a
bridge abutment.

Gladstone, a native of High
Point, lived at 1833 Banking St.
in Greensboro and was a jun‘or
as Guilford.

While at Davidson. he was a

houses, which are not covered
by the rule.

The student stated that the
rule is strictly enforced except
‘in the ‘single upperclass dorm
for Independents. He reported
that there is isolated damage
io the fraternity houses as a
result of drinking but the re-
pairs are made by the frater-
n-ties.

A general rule on gentleman-
ly conduct governs excessive
conduct on the part of Washing-
ion and Lee students in the com-
munity.

The news ediior of the Sewa-
nee Purple of the University of
the South stated that the uni-
versity maintains an unpopular
in toco parentis policy toward
darink:ing. The policy was re
cently changed by the regents
‘rom a policy which permitted
alcoholic consumption.

The reason given by the editor
for the change was that the re-
genis had held a recent meet-
ng on campus during one of the

big party weekends. There can
be no liquor or beer in the
dorms now but enforcement is
lax. said the editor, probably
as a result of the past policy.

The fraternity houses are
owned by the university but
the houses are reported. to, have
beer machines. The editor stat-
ed that on party weekends the
dean usually warns the [rater-
nities to be moderate in their
drinking and to do all drinking
upstairs in the house.

At the request of the Student
Council. the faculty will con-

Because of the decline of stu-

to be a big question in the
minds of the faculty whether
this practice still serves the pur-
pose it was intended to have."
said Bill Watson. a Student
Council member.

After talking with a number
of professors, Watson said.
“From what I have heard and
observed, the general attitude
of the faculty is that open house

offical policy of the university
is to prohib't alcoholic consump-
tion cn campus but there is
very lax enforcement of the
rule. accord:ng to the Carolina

The present policy on tickets

resolution in Wednesday night's

»The ticket policy, according to

the resolution which was sent to
Dr. Tom Scott, President Mar-

Athletic Committee, has ‘the
effect of alienating the Student
Body from the Athletic pro-

The Student Council called for

Police Continue Investigation
Of $100,000 Showboat Fire

Police are still investigating
the possibility of arson in yes-
terday’s early morning burning
of the riverboat Robert E. Lee.

Iredell County Deputy R. L.
Warren told THE DAVIDSON-
IAN this morning that there is
no definite proof of arson. “It's
just a theory,” Warren. said.

Warren said the sheriff's of-
fice is going through a list of
people connected with the boat
in an effort to find the cause of
the fire.

The fire occurred sometime
between 5 and 6 a.m. yesterday.
Damage was estimated at more
than $100.000. but there were no
injuries.

Warren said that a_ chain

‘

the landing was down and that
police found fresh tire tracks,
beer cans. a pack of cigarettes
and a door knob that had been
twisted off the building.

He said laboratory experts are
searching for fingerprints on the
cans and door knob.

dents were awakened by fire

Cornelius and Mount Mourne de-

However, the boat, a building

and the pier were burning out

This inspired Powers to voice
his opinions on the age-old prob
lem of demon rum. Needless to
say, Powers is upset over the
liberalized drinking rules at Da
vidson.

He then stated that ‘‘nothin’
good ever comes from drinking.
If you ever see any good come
from whiskey, you come by and
tell me all about it.”

The Grim Baker also offered
his views on the racial issue.
“God intended the world to have
two races,’’ Powers said, which
leads one to believe that mixed
‘marriages go all the way back
to Adam and Eve. "I was
‘brought up under the belief that
birds of a feather flock together.
Nowadays they’re trying to mix
up black birds with white birds
and I just don’t see it.”

For the most part, Powers
says it's a quiet life working

meal had started.

To cure this lack of inteltectu-

ness of many of the students,
Patterson suggested that the col-
lege allow drinking, and admit
girls to the college.

But he was pessimistic about
these changes being passed in
the near future as, he chuckled,
