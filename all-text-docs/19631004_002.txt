The Big Haul

The Davidson football teaan is not
the only group on campus that finds
itself saddled with a losing tradition.

As the turning leaves signal the
nearness of Homecoming and the be-
ginning of the Fall social season. it
becomes increasingly apparent that
the Davidson fraternities are losing
also. In this case, however, the loss is
financial—the checkbooks. not the
scoreboards, show the deficit.

The cause of this loss? After-
dance parties.

Since the bars in the fraternity
houses remain un-stocked and dry,
after-parties continue to be held off-
campus. This, in itself, is an expensive
proposition, costing each fraternity
upwards of $2000 per year.

But now a new menace has ap-
peared in the form of a growing mono-
poly which controls virtually every
combo—black or white—in this area.
The menace in question is Hit Attrac-
tions, Inc. of Charlotte, whose presi-
dent is Mr. Ted Hall. All roads lead
to Hall; contracting a combo directly
is a thing of the past.

Hit Attractions began booking
combos in this area in the Fall of 1961.
Since that time it has grown into a
big-time organization, which now
handles almost every band in North
and South Carolina. It must be admit-
ted that Hall’s organization has made
things a lot more convenient for the
various social chairmen. No longer are
arrangements made in pool halls at
the last minute. But with the conven-
ience has come additional expense for
the fraternities. And it has been ap-
preciable.

The latest move by Mr. Hall has
been to secure contracts with several
restaurants and clubs in the Charlotte
area, thus forcing the fraternities to
deal through him in order to rent
these particular places for a party. At
present, Riverview Inn, Pine Acres
Cabin, Daniels Studio, Hi-Fi Country

shrewd businessman, and the possibi-
lity is more than good that he will
soon have a similar agreement with
most of the available places in Char-
lotte. This spells trouble and more
money for Davidson fraternities.

Another related area of concern
lies in those restaurants and clubs
which are not yet under Hall’s wing.
Rent at these places has sky-rocketed
in the past three years. For example,
Lake Lynn Lodge in Concord now
charges $150. as compared with $75
in 1960. Add to this the amount spent
on food and set-ups, and it is apparent
that the resultant profit is all out of
proportion. .

Moreover, it must be realized
that restaurant-owners are not the
most cooperative people in the world
to deal with in such matters. It is vir-
tually impossible to secure a signed
contract with them. and last-minute
cancellations are not at all uncommon.
And, upon occasion, local law-enforce-
ment officers have heen known to
break up a party with some trumped-
up charge.

In short, the fraternities find
themselves over a barrel as far as
after-dance parties are concerned. Or,
compare the situation to a yise, with
Hall on one side and the restaurant-
owners on the other. We cannot help
but think that, in time, Hall will be
squeezing from both sides. The pre-
dicament will get worse before it gets
better, unless some not-so-subtle pres-
sure is applied by the fraternities in
the right places.

Since after-dance parties do not
exist (so says the Hill), it is doubtful
that the College can use its influence
to any avail. Therefore, we call on the
IFC to initiate an immediate study of
the problem and use any means at its
disposal (collective bargaining, boy-
cott, etc.) to insure reasonable prices
and to lessen the chances of a com-
plete monopoly in the future.

Wet parties may be expensive,

In the slippery course of the two-day weekend, the Grim Reaper ran wild as 97 wrecks

Athletes Top Scholars
In Financial Aid Race

BY BILL RUTH

and
SMITH McKEITHEN

Homecoming .. . alumni . . . tweeds and dry leaves: fall.is upon us, and with it

another football season. A time when every campus newspaper must herald the vic-

tories and whitewash the defeats.

The time for a pigskin in-
trospection has come; not be-
cause of three losses, and even
three resounding victories will
not ameliorate its necessity.

Football at Davidson is big
business. It is not just a coach
and a team, and any blame or
praise is not their's alone. Dav-
idson football is a large, well-
eiled perpetual motion machine
which consumes most of its fuel
in a process. of self-preservation.

This year $87,000 will be di-
vided among 59 football players
in the form of athletic grants
which are applied to tuition and
fees.

Nearly three-fourths of the
team is receiving aid of this
type. Eighteen football players
are receiving $1,500 or more
and ten are getting between
$1,000 and $1,500.

Although it might be assumed
that the amount of the stipend is
often determined by the player’s
need, their parents are not re-
quired to submit a confidential
financial statement. Grant recip-
jients are also allowed to keep
cars on campus and are not re-
quired to participate in any
kind of campus work.

Athletic grants are award-
ed exclusively on the recom-
mendation of the heed coach
and there is no screening of
these students by the scholer-
ship committee of the Admis-
sions Office after they heve
been accepted by the college.

Comparison of fdotball and
academic scholarships points out
other inegaities: There are pres-
ently 244 students receiviig aid
in the form of academic scholat-
ships. The total amount paid to

“these men is just under ‘$150,-
'@00. 4 "
. hh ae

Thus, it can be seen that four

times the sumber of students

are receiving only twice as much
money. The average football
grant is worth $1,125. The aver-
age academic scholarship, $615.

For many years the athletic
grant program was supported
by The Wildcat Club, an alumni
group which gave money to the
College earmarked for the ath-
letic department.

When the Living Endowement
program was initiated in the
mid 1950's, the Wildcat Club
agreed to ceaso its separate
fund-raising activities on the
condition that 34% of the Living
Endowement would go to the
athletic grant program.

The Living Endowement for
the fiscal year ending June 1962,
on which the 1963-64 athletic
grant program is based, was
$202,000. Thirty-four percent of
this figure is $68,680, an amount
just exceeding the total amount
given in football grants.

Where then does the basket-
ball team get its subsidy of
$18,800?

This money is the product of
an interesling condition of the

Wildeat Club agreement: The
base number of grants is com-
puted by dividing this 34% -of
the Living Endowment by the
1955 tuition and fees figure;
this number is then multiplied
by today’s cost ($1,725) to de-
tive the amount which the Ath-
letic Department can spend on
athletic grants. There is no re-
Striction as to the number of
grants finally given. nor the a-
mount eash is worth.

This year the total expendi-
ture far athletic grants is $85.,-
800, a figure considerably great-
er than the simple 34% of the
Living Endowement.

There are several questions
which might well be posed now:
Is this aid of sufficient necessity
to the students receiving it to
warrant such a large expendi-
ture? Can this expense be cut
without endangering the calibre
of football played at Davidson?
How would this money be used
if not for athletic grants?

In the next few weeks we
shall seek to answer these and
similar questions concerning
athletic finances at Davidson.

At approximately- 11:30 p.m.
on Sept. 28 a Florida-bound mid-
dle-aged couple. from Ohio were
involved in a 4-car collision that
included, among others, a car
with three Davidson College
Students and their dates. The
wreck occurred on Highway 21,
about eight miles south of Dav-
idson.

Action began as the couple's
1959 Oldsmobile sedan and fol-
lowing house trailer were struck
broadside by a car driven by
some cedarchoppers returning
home after a hard night at the
grease factory.

His north-bound 1958 Chevro-
let swerved off the right side of
the pavement in driving rain
when he apparently dozed at the
wheel. After waking up to the
tealization that the vehicle was
going into the embankment on
the right side of the highwav,
said cedar chopper spun his
wheels to the extreme left and
was able to regain the surface
of the pavement.

However, the condition of the
pavement in the rain was such
that he lost control of his car
again in the sharp left turn, and
crashed into the south-bound
Ohioans broadside, knocking
their trailer some 60 feet from
the point of impact. The trailer
was thrown into a ditch on the
left side of the road, and the
Oldsmobile, due to the same im-
pact, was left with a smashed
door and fender on the driver's
side.

The cedar chopper’s car was
thrown from whence it came—
back across the road to the foot
of the embankment he had been
heading for originally. But the
yellow Oldsmobile was left sit-
ting lengthwise across the high-
way.

It is a time-honored parable
that cedar choppers never travel
alone, but in pairs. And lo, in
honor of said custom, along
comes the cedar chopper’s mate,

LLL SS,

Ford, to smash into the hapless
Oldsmobile, again broadside,
Since this broadside blast was
upon the other side of the car,
the Body. by Fisher was now dis-
membered into the remnants of
a “skeleton by Volkswagen,” or
some more apt analogy.
Fortunately, the occupants of
the Oldsmobile, uninjured by
the first blow, removed them-
selves from their auto before
the second wreck. which oecur-
red about a minute later.
Traffic was now beginning to
stop on both sides of the high-
way to survey the damage. But

none of the arrivals could ascer--

tain any way to remove the
Oldsmobile from the center of
the road in its present shape
(two wheels actually smashed
down upon the road, and no
motor power whatsoever left in
the battered hulk).

A few persons began stopping
traffic at both ends of the wreck
to warn them to slow down due
to the obstacle ahead. However,
of the half-dozen or so cars
spread along the highway, there
was but one flashlight to signal
the cars with. This was put to
use at the south (CHarlotte) end
of the wreckage.

The difficulty of warning pass-
ing motorists on a rainy night
without any visible means of
signalling is readily apparent.

At this point enter Sammy
Going and his blue Corvair. Also
enter the people in Sammy’s car

three Queens frosh. And enter
they did—with one hell of a
bang.

Going, approaching the north
end of the wreckage, did not
see the signals, if there were
any (which no one readily re-
calls). He also smashed broad-
side into the unfortunate Olds-
mobile.

Going’s entrance did, however,
remove the Oldsmobile from the
road, and it also removed cedar
chopper number 1, standing be-
side the Olds wringing his hands
in anxiety, into a ditch full of
mud. He and the occupants of
the Corvair all escaped with
minor cuts, and with one excep-
tion the three girls withstood
the excitement and shock re-
markably well.

About 30 minutes later the
harried police, who had had one
of the worst nights in‘ the his-
tory of Mecklenburg County, ar-
rived, and with them an ambu-
lance. Names were taken, flares
were set out, and everyone not
directly connected with the in-
cident was requested to leave.

To wit, everybody left—ex-
cept for Ted Pulliam, who later
had three stitches taken in his
head, a Queens blonde who was
suffering from shock, and a
pretty near  scared-to-death
cedar chopper who said he had
a stomach cramp. He was either
faking or scared of the cops, and
probably both.

GUILTY AS CHARGED:
WALLACE DENIES NEGROES
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS |

BY RICK von UNWERTH

Two weeks ago this column was devoted to George
Wallace—more specifically to what we consider his
directed concern in the race issue. It was meant to be a
castigation of his conduct in Alabama school desegrega-
tion.

That conduct was deplorable, rosd improve-
ments and industrial progress notwithstanding.

We are not ignorant of Wallace's achievements in
other areas; we have no quarrel with Wallace’s adminis-
tration as such.

But the issue at hand is human rights—life, liberty,
the pursuit of happiness. Governor Wallace has vocifer-
ously demanded the rights of his state; then venomously
denied the righits of the individual. How does he draw
the line?

The United States Constitution guarantees equality
before the law. It purports to guarantee also that a man
is innocent until proven guilty. The American public
offers no such guarantee. A editorial in a Birmingham
newspaper, sent to THE DAVIDSONIAN in support of a
letter on this page, quietly set the Negro straight:

“The only way Negroes in Birmingham can at-
tain the position they seek is through gaining the
respect of the whites. (Guilty...) This they do not
have at present.

“This respect may be gained through assuming lead-
ership of their race by local Negroes, at the same time
shunning outside spokesmen who seek financial gain.”
A good point; a icult point.

In the same batch of clippings, these statistics were
quoted:

_ “One of every four white county (Jefferson County)
teachers has a master’s degree. One of every three Negro
instructors holds a master’s.

“Of the 1,450 white teachers, 131 have no college
degree. Every one of the 579 Negro teachers holds either
a bachelor’s or higher degree, thus the average Negro
salary is higher.”

Some Negroes, apparently, have troubled themselves
to seek an education, and to quietly return and share
their enlightenment.

How far must you go to earn this elusive “re-
spect’?

Or is the point that six thousand a year is damn good
money for a nigger?

A case can be made for moderates on both sides.
“Enemy of the South” is a fruitless designation—it is
applied to Martin Luther King, Jr. and to George Wallace
with equally poignant justification. If we deplore condi-
tions in Detroit, say, are we “enemies of the North’?
The editorial quoted above offers this suggestion:

“It is time for all to stop, step back, and appraise
Birmingham’s plight.

“By all we include the Kennedy administration in
Washington, Negro leaders, segregationists.

“Of Washington, we ask, does the end justify the
means. Are you idealists with true convictions, or do you
pursue political ambitions?”

May we ask the same chilling question of George
Wallace? And can we ask it of ourselves?

In an interview last Saturday, Billy Graham said that
“Race relations are far bétter in the South than in the.
North. There’s a love between .the races down South,” he

observed.
Fine.

But of what social use—of what benefit to himself,
his race, his Southern home—is an “Uncle Tom Nigger”?
Is that love paternal—a timely mess of greens and a pat

on a scarred nappy head?

In the new industrial South we need the Negro.

We need him trained and

ready, alongside the white

man. Birmingham—the “Magic City”—don‘t waste

him.

In demanding the rights of our several states, Gover-
nor Wallace, we concur. But—forgive an inconsistency—
grant us our rights as several citizens.

Students Reject Authority,
French Ignore Their Profs

BY SERGE RICARD
Richardson Scholar from France

Three weeks in Davidson have
already taught me much about
the college atmosphere. The ze-
lationship that I see between the
faculty and administration and
the students has really been a
revelation to me.

Let me explain why.

Take, for instance, 30 French
students who belong to the same
class in a Lyeee (French equiva-
lent of high school plus two
years of college).

The class room will be all the
year the scene of action: insult-
ing, fighting (fists are more
powerful than words), disagree-
ing (the cause of the uproar),
ete.

’ The classroom in a Lycee is a
synonym
Pranct(*> >. men
fessor or doctor (it doesn’t make
any difference to the students)

will enter and try to say a few
words, which will generally be
welcomed by insulting indiffer-
ence—or maybe different in-
sults.

If he is wise, he will retreat
and report the “chahut"” (Lycee
slang for a noisy demonstration
or boycott of a class) to the
proviseur (Lycee president). who
has always avoided heart attacks
thanks to patience.

If he is brave and still be-
lieves in education. he will sit
down and start talking to the
savages: “Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself.” ,

Now let’s give some explana-
tion for what happens in the
classroom.

French students will .never
agree with one another but on
one point: VAdministration,

for battlefield in -which .in France includes hoth
rp . ow. faculty antl administration.
ait © yetbvomithentartesthat-pree “its theepublin enteay. numnbcs

one.
Administration equals regula-

tions. And have you ever seen a
Frenchman following rules?

Look in a park at a lawn pro-
tected by a “keep off the grass”
sign—you'll see dozens of peo-
ple lying and walking on it!

According to any Frenehman,
a policeman is a social nuisance
second to the alcoholic.

The reason for the strained
student-adminigtration relatinns
which exist in many French
schools is quite simple. The Ad-
ministration doesn’t trust the
students and the students have
never experienced both freedom
and responsibility.

Truly friendly relations do
exist here at Davidson.

There is none of that suspic-
ion which I deplore in French
Lycees, no barrier between the
students and faculty and admin-
istration.

The French student only stud-
ies- at-his -epppol,, the Smerjcan
student has both studies end a
social life,

for this I am apologetic, but I
shall not fail to do so again, es-
pecially after reading von Un-
worthy.

I looked in the 1963 annual
for his name, to see where he
eame from. I did not find it.

Let him kindly segregate him-
self from me.

1 can intergrate (sic) with
Negroes, (Ive lived among
them all my life) but ? cennot
intergrate (sic) with Yankees
like him, and there aren't
enough court orders or bayon-
ets to make me.

As to the Birmingham church
bombing: my informants at City
Hall state that there were too
many sticks of dynamite for it
to have been thrown; it was
definitely placed.

The FBI has found not one
trace of a timing device, there-
fore a fuse was used. The long-
est fuses burn only thirty min-
utes, and noisily.

It is beyond the realm of pos- ;
sibility for a white man to have
entered that area, particularly
at that time, and, unnoticed, te
have placed such a bundle and
lighted the fuse.

The four girls unfortunately
killed would not have been, had
they been where a Negro would
know the children would be at
that hour, in another part of the
church. These four had gone to
the restroom.

Hf Rick von Unworthy is from
the South, all I can say is, he
doesn't deserve to be.

May the Lord have mercy on
our souls if, we are begetting
the likes of him." =~
