Library Group
Meets

Professor C. G. Davidson went
to Raleigh on a meeting of the
Committee on Co-ordination of
College Library Research of the
North Carolina Library Assoc-
iation on April 15.

The committee discussed the
possibility of compiling an in-
dex of North Carolina periodi-
cals. This index would be similar
to the Reader’s Guide, except
that it would deal entirely with
North Carolina magazines. Pro-
fessor Davidson stated that there
was a great need for an index
of this sort. However the plan
was just di d: no definit
action was taken on the matter.
Professor Davidson suggested
that all College Libraries de-
posit all of their duplicate ma-
terial in a central place for the
Purpose of exchange. However
this plan was not found prac-
tical.
