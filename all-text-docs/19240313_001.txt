While Coach Younger is scratching his
head over the problem of finding a receiving
mate for the hurling staff that is working
out daily, infielders and outfielders are re-
sorting to pep games and gymnasium exer-
cise, In the meantime every effort is being
made to get the drainage system on Richard-
son Field into perfect working order so that
baseball practice may its rightful
proportions. Recent rains and snow have
handicapped Coach Monk in his early prac-
tice, and the old horsehide sport is being
temporarily held up.

The general call aspirants not
been sounded, Jupiter Pluvius forbidding.
However, letter men from last year's nine,
and prospective hurling candidates are work-
ing out daily on the few choice high spots
and knolls. It is expected that ‘practice will
be begun in carnest by the last of the week.

Younger will have six Varsity men around
which to mould his team. Captain Boushee,
star twirler of two past seasons, will lead the
Wildcat nine and will be depended upon for
a number of Red and Black victories. He
is regarded as one of the best portside hurl-
ers in the state. His judgment is sure, his
eye is keen, his pace is even and calmly
regulated and his arm is good. The student
body has confidence in their baseball leader.

The other letter men are Teddie Coving-
ton, third sacker of last year’s squad; Sion

CHINESE CUSTOMS SHOWN

Stories of Adventure in the Hermit

Dr. Robert F. Fitch, president of Hang-
chow Christian College, who visited David-
son during Sunday and Monday, delivered
a lecture on Hangchow and its Environs, at
the Y. M. C. A. service Sunday. The serv-
ice was a combination of the regular “Y”
vesper and the night service of the local
Presbyterian Church, and was held in
Shearer Hall at 7:00 o'clock. Dr. Richards
presided and C. V. Brown led the song
service.

The lecture was stereoptican in natureathe
pictures being shown on the front wall of
the building.

In introducing his subject, Doctor Fitch
gave a few words in regard to his work in
Hangchow in relation to the founding of the
college, which took place 25 years ago.

Pictures were shown of the beautiful bay
on which Hangchow is situated. The sites
of the beautiful Hangchow Christian Col-
lege was also seen. The speaker then took
his audience to some of the old and historic
spots around Hangchow and Shanghai. He
showed the Buddhist temples, the torture
chambers which are prominent features of
the Chinese religious ceremonies in worship
of their gods.

Buildings erected centuries before Amer-
ica was discovered, with the ancient tales of
the natives in regard to their significance,
contained interesting and valuable informa-
tion to the ‘audience:

will turn out and make it a success.

made, the program will be as follows:

Girls.

might eventually be 1,000 Student Volun-
teers. The movement has since then hada
marvelous growth, not only in the United
States, but in) England and Seandi-

10,300 Volunteers, and when the other coun-
tries are included the grand total reaches
over 14,000. Over 2,000 of these were sign-
ed up in the few years immediately follow-
ing this first convention, when it seemed
that only a spark was needed among. the

Six ‘National Praternites Host To

Non-Fraternity Men at Week-End Party

Sophomores Make
Merry at Feed
In Queen City

The entire Sophomore class as a body,
together ‘with’ several especially invited
| guests, will leave this afternoon for Char-
lotte to make merry with the annual Soph
banquet, which will be held in the Chamber
of Commerce building, at 7:30 p.m. A com-
mittee consisting of I. K. Regen, H. L.
Shaw, Frank Hudson, J. A. Minter, and J.
| A. Bouvier, has perfected all plans for this,
the most riotous celebration in the annals of
the Soph classes of Davidson.

| .Guests of the class will be Professors Ar-
! buckle and Fleagle, Coach W. [.. Younger,
land Elkins, Hillhouse, McIlwaine, and Chris-
Itian, representatives of the three other classes.
| Tickets for the banquet have been on sale
| for some time, with the result that practi-
‘cally every member of ’26 has been primed
| for a week or more to enjoy himself to the
| fullest with the proposed eatments and en-
|tertainments. Cars have been provided and
us is expected that almost all loyal members
of 1926 will be on hand to get away at the
'first possible moment so as to arrive at the
Queen City in plenty of time.

The program will consist of the class his-
‘tory, short talks from student guests, class
/poems,. and addresses by faculty members,
‘with toasts all the way between. In addi-

|tion there will be musical numbers from the |

| quartet, and many impromptu numbers which
| bid to furnish humor for the occasion. Tom
Baker, the president of the class, will act as
‘toastmaster, and many healths will be drunk

sistance of good Charlotte water. After the

Pan Hellenic Gouncil Sponsors
Week-End of Enjoyment for
Non-Fraternity Men

FIRST WEEK IN APRIL

Fraternities Extend Special Invita-
tions to All Members of Three
Upper Classes

Sponsored by the Pan Hellenic Council,
the six national fraternities will be hosts to
the non-fraternity men in the three upper
classes and to the members of the faculty
and their wives at a house party on the hill
the week-end of April 5th. The small size
of the halls and the large number of men
in the Freshman class automatically limits
the oceasion to the three upper classes. Each
chapter, in alphabetical order, has gone down
the roster of the student body and the men
will be extended especial invitations by the
chapter to which their name falls.

Yet the house party is general, and every
hall will be at the particular disposal of each
and every man in the three upper classes.

Elaborate preparations are being made to
provide entertainment for the guests of the
week-end. Not only will the hails be open
but in addition the Pan Hellenic is planning
an entertainment nature on the
campus after the picture show. The pro-
jgram for Saturday, which is only tentative
as yet, will be on this order:

of some

Saturday :
Afternoon: Baseball with Oak Ridge.
Night: Little Old New York.
Campus fete.
General reception in fraternity
halls.
Though this outline may not be followed
to the letter, the Pan Hellenic will see to it
that there is entertainment suitable to the

a) moment.
