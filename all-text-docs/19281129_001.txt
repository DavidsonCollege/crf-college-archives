Six Nominations Are to be Made

ONE BALLOTT ELIMINATED

Athletic Trophy is Given Each
Year to Best All-Round
Athlete

This year the winner of the Norris
Athletic Trophy is to be voted upon after
having been nominated by the Davidson
“D” Club. Heretofore there has been no
nominations, but the student could vote
upon any member of the student body. The
trophy, which is awarded each year to the
best all-round athlete, went to the man
who hd been chosen on a selection of three
ballots, the highest six of the first ballot
being voted upon in the second, the high-
est three of the second ballot being voted
upon in the third. ‘

The change in rules amounts to an eli-
mination the first ballot. The “D"
Club will nominate six men, from whom
the highest three will be chosen and voted
upon in the second ballot, the highest man
of the last ballot winning the trophy. Sec-

for athletes other than the six nominees,
Since there is no Drovision made as to
what will be the decision if a man not
nominated by the “D' Club receives the
highest number of votes, it is judged that
he will yet be eligible.

Following is a draft of the new rules:
