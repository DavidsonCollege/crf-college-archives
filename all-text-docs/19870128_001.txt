Careers Office hosts
42 recruiters

By JIM DILLON
“Placement season,” as they
call it in the Careers Office, has

‘begun, and director Ken Wood

says he expects a record number
of companies to visit Davidson
seeking employees.

Currently 42 companies are
scheduled to send recruiters.
Wood said he expects that the
final number before the end of the

year will surpass 50.

“I expect we'll have more re-
cruiters than we’ ve-ever had in the
history of Davidson College,”
Wood said. “That is a result of us
sending well over a hundred let-
ters and dozens of phone calls in-

viting other companies to come.
here and recruit. This has been re-

warded with several new com-
panies expressing interest in com-
ing for the first time.”

~Nine companies are ions
to visit Davidson for the first time.
They are rca teat Bene-

fits Division, Bowles, Hollowell
and Conner financial investment
firm, Charter Data Systems, the
City of Charlotte, First Home
Federal Savings and Loan, Geo-
rgia State Merit system, Interna-
tional Paper, PMA Insurance
Companies and Quaker Oats.
Wood said Davidson is limited in
the types of companies that tend to
recruit at Davidson.

“There is an understandable
frustration on the part of students
in terms of kinds of companies we
attract which are mainly banks
and -financial investment. firms.
The fact is that companies repre-
senting human services and
human interest groups don't re-
cruit at Davidson, but nor do they
recruit at any other schools.”

Wood said. fewer students
were present at the Careers Of-

- fice’s placement orientation meet-

ing than in past years. He attri-
butes that to an increase in the

me

number of students going to
graduate school.

“I think there might be a trend
back to grad school,” Wood said.
“At one time the kind of jobs
available at the PhD level were
tight, and that whole thing is
opening up again.” -

Wood said Davidson is ex-—
periencing an increased interest in
internships. He estimated that 35
students are currently working as
part-time interns in Charlotte, and
approximately half are receiving
academic credit for their work.
Students interested in working as
an intern for the spring term in
Charlotte or through either the
Washington Center or _ the
Philadelphia Center in those cities
should consult with Wood as soon
as possible.

Leonard speaks on the slow Gorbachev revolution

By TOM MOORE
Former U.S. arms negotiator
James F. Leonard addressed a
question currently being consid-
ered by top government officials
around the world: his lecture,

“Can Gorbachev Be Taken Seri- .

ously?” ~ attracted a _ post-
snowstorm crowd of about 40
Thursday night in the Morrison
Room of the Union.

The answer, according to
Leonard, seems to be a qualified
es.” He cited the encouraging,
but uneven, recent progress of the
Soviet Union in areas such as its
foreign policy ‘and domestic prob-
lems such as alcoholism.

The alcohol situation in the

U.S.S.R. is “appalling,” said
Leonard. “Middle-aged males
have fallen into the habit of con-
suming great quantities of al-
cohol,” even on the way to work
in the morning. “Alcohol now has
the function of religion in the
West,” which according to Karl
Marx was the “opiate of the
people,” Leonard said. “The aver-
age lifespan of males was de-

Inside

creasing.”
The Gorbachev Administra-
tion responded by making

changes in the role of the party in -

citizens’ daily lives. Not major
changes, Leonard said, but ones
designéd to make it seem as
though the party was “no longer
controlling, but there to serve as a
model . . . they’re now preach-
ing.”

Another subtle change in the
attitude of the Gorbachev Admin-
istration is “the abandonment of
the pretense that all was perfect”
in the U.S.S.R. The government
is now exhibiting “the quality of

_ being accessible to public de-

bate,” he said.

Leonard noted the public
chastisement of a KGB official as
a sign of the government’s open-
ing up. “There had never been a
case in which the KGB was

‘criticized in public,” he said. The
official was disciplined for abuse
of power. “Up until now, the
KGB was the abuse of power.”
Not only was the action against
the official surprising, but also the

source: the head of the KGB him-
self. This is a significant departure
from past policy, said Leonard.

Also, Gorbachev has been
giving strong speeches which are
then censored by Pravda and
broadcast reports the next day.
This .is in contrast to other Soviet
leaders who kept even the uncut
version of their speeches bland
and tidy, said Leonard. ‘He is try-
ing to get the Soviet intelligentsia
on his side . . . they have been
dissatisfied but are still patriotic.”

The recent release of Soviet
dissident Sakharov was another
attempt to appeal to the educated
classes of the U.S.S.R., Leonard
said. Currently, “the technocracy
is enamored of him.”

A less successful front of the
Gorbachev Administration’s ef-
forts to “be taken seriously”

worldwide. is_ its. foreign policy

situation. Leonard divided the
U.S.S.R.’s foreign policy con-
centrations into three concentric
circles: the U.S., Third World na-

tions, and its immediate neigh-

bors.

“The Soviets Nave begun to
address Afghanistan,” Leonard
said. “They have begun to. ac-
knowledge that they have serious
problems there.” Leonard said
that the Soviet Union faces the
same situation in many ways that
the United States did in Vietnam.
They are facing the same quag-
mire situation and probably want
to get out very badly, but are find-
ing it difficult to do so without los-
ing face. Despite their problems,
“they show no signs of making
radical change.”

The Soviets have been more
successful in dealing with their
immediate — neighbors, said
Leonard, but “their most notewor-
thy moves” are in their bilateral
relations with the United States,
significant enough “to justify the
word ‘Revolution.’”

These moves include offers of
on-site inspections of Soviet mili-
tary installations on Soviet terri-
tory, which the Soviet govern-
ment worked out with an Ameri-
can nongovernmental agency. Ina
conference in Budapest, they

talked of each side pulling out
50,000 men on the West German
border within two years, accord-
ing to Leonard.

When the United States sev-
eral years: ago proposed a. “zero-
situation, which involves ©
getting rid of all the missiles on
both sides, it was attacked by ob-
servers in the West who said the
U.S.S.R. would never accept the
terms. Now, the U.S.S. R. has ac-
cepted the terms, “but now we’re
with it!”
Leonard exclaimed. “Obviously,”
he said, the arms control climate is
such that “a deal can be made if we
want it.”

Summing up, Leonard said,
“The ‘Gorbachev Revolution’ is
uneven, but it is clearly a begin-
ning.” For the moment, though,
the U.S.S.R. “will remain a prob-
lem country.”

trol negotiator, serves as Scoville
