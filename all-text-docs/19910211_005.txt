Oh No, Not Again

It’s that time of year again. The arrival.of 4 new season
seems to guarantee that Davidson will be included in yet
‘another ranking or college guide. Last summer, Fortune
magazine ranked Davidson seventh out of 66 schools in
number of graduates who become chief executive officers of
major U.S. companies. In the fall, U.S. New & World Report
- in their annual “beauty contest” rated us as the tenth best liberal
arts college in the nation. Now, this winter, Davidson has been
included in Mr. Buckley’s new conservative guide to Amer-
ica’s 50 best liberal arts schools.

Some parts of the guide are applaudable. For instance, the
editors have singled out Davidson for its emphasis on under-
graduate teaching and the strong honor system. It also men-
tions Davidson’s long and hard work ethnic.

What is bothersome with the work, however, is its political
intent. Naturally any sort of ranking is harmful; but a political
label is clearly more dangerous, Stereotyping Davidson’s

culture as conservative, “both social and political,” will hurt |

efforts by the college to recruit both minority faculty members
and students, an area the administration has been somewhat
succesful with in the past. Furthermore, the guide makes the
assumption that the hiring of African-American candidates
will sacrifice the academic quality of our institution. This
narrow-minded perspective is not only an insult to the minority
members of the faculty, but the entire faculty body.

The guide is also factually wrong: it claims that Davidson is
located twenty miles south of Charlotte. As one student clev-
erly commented there are probably a lot of conservatives in
Rock Hill searching for our school.

Our faculty members and the administration need no “ho-
lier-than-thou” lecture regarding the future of Davidson from
the conservative guide. In the past they have been instrumen-
tal in making ¢ our institution what itis. Certainly, they will be

instrumental in making Davidson what i it will be. By diversi-

fying our curriculum and faculty Davidson is preparing itself
for world that is gradually growing interdependent. Our selec-.
tion to the new guide is not a distinction - it is disgusting.

Letters

Lehman Lauds Montgomery

To the Editor:

Thank you Will
Montgomery! You defi-
nitely have a good perspac-
tive, one that is a welcome
relief from the Davidsonian.
However, you may like to
know that the U. S. Corps of
Engineers is actually an in-
tegral part of the Army (the
proper title being the “U. S.
Army Corpsof Engineers). I
agree whole heartedly thatif
mandatory service is re-
quired of our young menand
women, there are many op-
tions from which to choose.
Youhave outlined several in
your article; here are a few
more.

The Peace Corps is a
definite option for mostcol-

lege graduates, teaching in
inter-city schools or in rural
Appalachian schools, work-
ing for United Way or the
Red Cross. There is a lot a
person could doto better this
country.

I chose to serve in the
military and am currently a
Signal Corps officer with a
National Guard unit.
Granted, the military paid
for part of my college edu-
cation (for which1 am grate-
ful) but I have no qualms
about my current status (ie.
serving in‘the military) or
the possibility of serving in
the Persian Gulf. (I don’t
want to go to war but realize
that if ordered to active duty,
I will go without hesitation.)
I for one believe that this is,

at least partly, a war fought
for economic reasons, What
war has’t been essentially
econmic on one level or
another?

I also commend you for
defending those who may
appear to be in one “camp”
or another on this issue, yet
reality may be quite differ-
ent. I wasan art major and an
ROTC cadet. I am now a
military officer and an artist.
I wear penny loafers and
Birkenstocks, tye-dyes and
oxford buttondowns. Per-
haps I am simply an anach-
ronism but perhaps not.

Sincerely,

‘Mount Defines Feminism

To the Editor:

The American Heritage

Dictionary defines “femi-
nism” as “a doctrine that
advocates of demands for
women the some. rights
granted men, as in political
and economic status.” Un-
fortunately we haverecently
lost this clear meaning, and
feminism has come to mean
the female equivalent of
chauvinism.

Much to my dismay and
disgust, Davidson women
when asked tend to say, “No,
ofcourse I’m not one of those
types!” If not envisioning a
lesbian with a gun and a
button reading “I HATE
MEN” they at least picture
someone condescending to
males, blaming them for all
evil in the world, and trying
totakeoverexactly the same
dominating spot that men

hold now. This perversion

_of the definition has perhaps

come from extreme radicals
who. often dominate the
spotlight in order to over-
State a point, but in reality
these are false representa-
tions anyway.

As Davidson women, we
spend a great deal of time
and money to get a good
education in order to suc-
ceed at anything from rear-
ing kids to doctoring. If you
are putting all this energy
into it, how can any one of
you dare tell me that you are
not a feminist?

Do you want to work as
hard at your career as aman
with the same job and get
paid the some amount? Do
you feel you should have an
equal opportunity to even
apply for sucha job? Do you
think you should be allowed
to do everything a man is

allowed to do and receive
the respect he does? If you
answered yes to any of these
questions, uh-oh, guess what
that means. Madam (or Sir),
we are sorry to inform you
that you are a feminist by the
true and original definition
of the word.

As it often does, the
solution lies in the middle,
not to either extreme of
dominance or submission.
True feminists reach toward
equality. The reason this is
called “feminism” and not
“equalism”’ is just that fe-
males must strive toward the
middle Promised Land
where males already stand
firmly, and sometimes they
donotrealize we canall stand
up ther together.

Sincerely,
