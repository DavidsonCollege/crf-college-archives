THE DAVIDSONIAN. ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, APRIL 18, 1994

Dubravka tickles the ivories -

By Josh Larned

Dubravka Tomsic’s fingers
danced across the piano with tre-
mendous grace and self-assurance,
as she focused intently upon inter-
preting the works of Ludwig van
Beethoven and Frédéric Chopin to
her enthralled audience. Such su-
perb playing characterized the
Slovenian pianist’s performance
last Monday night in Hodson Hall.
Given Ms. Tomsic’s world-wide
‘renown, the performance, a rare
treat for Davidson, was the final
installment of the 1993-94
Davidson College Concert Seriés.
Tomsic ripped into her per-
formance with a brilliant rendition
of Beethoven’s “Les Adieux” (So-
nata Op. 81a in E-flat major). Her
powerful playing provided her lis-
teners with unique introspection
into the German composer’s adept-
ness at fusing together complex
melodies with distinct feeling. She

continued her interpretation of the
master by easily performing the
extremely intricate and melodic
“Waldstein” (Sonata Op. 53 in C
major). All in all, Tomsic’s ac-
complished playing gave the audi-
ence a fresh, “hands-on” approach
to these familiar works by
Beethoven.

However, as if things could
not have been any more intense,
Tomsic returned from a brief inter-
mission to captivate her audience
with Chopin’s Sonata Op. 35 in B-
flat Major. With her strength and
conviction on the piano, she con-
veyed in a dazzling rendition the
powerful emotion that underlies
and typifies the majority of the
Polish composer’s works. For ex-
ample, "Marche Funebre" was per-
formed with such solemnity and
sorrow, that the audience was ren-
dered silent in their seats until the
piece picked up with the final

Presto. Tomsic concluded with
Chopin’s Andande Spianato. and
Grand Polonaise Brillante, Op. 22.

Ms. Tomsic, a pianist of leg-
endary stature in her native
Slovenia and Eastern Europe, has
accumulated numerous awards and

accolades throughout herstunning ~

career. She won the Brussels
“Mozart Festival” International
Composition (1967), the Zupancic
Prize (1970), the Golden Lyre
(1970), the Preseren Prize (1978),
and the Gold Medal with “Odre de
Saint Fortunat” (Mainz, 1987). In
addition, she has amassed over 40
recordings since 1987 alone.

According to senior music stu-
dent Brett Palmer, “It was truly an
amazing show.” Those who missed
Ms. Tomsic last Monday night
denied themselves a special op-
portunity to witness one of the
world’s greatest contemporary pia-
nists in action.

Gare Saint-Lazare Monet paintings differ from his garden works, Tucker says

Tucker continued from page 10

used in Monet’s rendering of “in-
stantaneity” on the canvas, the
scholar asserted that Monet’s
choice of subject is quite deliber-
ate. One might believe that, since
impressionism is concerned with
painting how light reflects off of
objects, Monet does not analyze

the object itself or hold much con-
cern for the choice of his subject.
Tucker affirmed that “while his
aesthetic choices are important—
they should not overshadow the
choices he makes concerning sub-
ject.” Tucker’s discussion of sub-
ject centered on Monet’s 1877 col-
lection of the Gare Saint-Lazare—
a train station in Paris, of which

eight paintings were shown in the
Third Impressionist Exhibition.
Tucker explored Monet’s choice
of subject and how the artist chose
to confront modernity in an in-
creasingly mechanized Paris.
According to Tucker, Monet’s
painting of the Gare Saint-Lazare
in 1877 says much about the artist.
Monet as a landscape artist was

faced with the modernist world in
which he should choose a subject.
Tucker found that Monet had put a
great deal of thought into the care
for detail in his rendering of the
station, which was evident in his
filling two entire sketchbooks with
studies for his paintings. Appre-
ciators of Monet often believe his
paintings were spontaneous. and
lacked such deliberation and con-
cern for detail. ;
Tucker explained the scien-
tific and mechanistic discoveries
Which led up tothe year in’ which
Monet created the collection.
Tucker discussed the moderniza-
tion of Paris, as the surrounding

‘ countryside was annexed by the

city. Monet, witnessing such
changes, rendered a sign of the
changing aspects of his time. The
Gare Saint-Lazare paintings em-
phasized the modern use of iron,
which Tucker called “God-child
of the 19th century.” The U.S. had
just completed the transcontinen-
tal railroad, and in Europe, and
even in Japan the train was open-
ing up trade routes and affecting
the abilities for people to travel.

Monet captures the spirit of the
reconstructive years following the
Franco-Prussian War. The Gare
Saint-Lazare built during this pe-
riod, celebrates France’s return to
normalcy. :
Finally, Tucker expressed that
the painting mocked the traditional
world through the use of: chaotic,
swirling smoke. Monet depicts a
world that has “lost clarity and
meaning.” Monet joins other art-
ists of modern thought, forming
the bridge between naturalistic
painting and abstract art of the
-20th century. According to Tucker,
Monet abandons “the story-telling
and narrative nature of earlier paint-
ing, therefore creating a more po-
etic canvas.” Monet’s painting
had little to do with history, reli-
gion, or mythology, according to
Tucker, but “evokes the heroism
of modern existence.”

— Paul Tucker is a professor of
art history at the University of
Massachusetts and has written two
books on Monet: Monetin the 90s:
The Series Paintings and Monet of
Argenteuil. Tucker is currently
working on his third book.
