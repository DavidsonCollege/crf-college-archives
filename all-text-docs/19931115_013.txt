Still full of rage, bitterness & discontent, Pearl Jam delivers Vs.

By Rachel Newcomb

At the MTV music awards
earlier this year, Pearl Jam per-
formed the song “Animal” from
their new album, Vs. It was a
frenzied, agonized performance
that left the audience crying for
more. They followed by playing
an excellent rendition of Neil
Young’s “Keep on Rockin’ in the
Free World” with the man himself,
Neil Young. After the song was

- over Pearl Jam smashed their in-
struments and the microphone
stands, while Neil Young placed
his guitar calmly in its holder and
walked off stage. Smashing in-
struments is by no means an un-
common gesture for a rock ‘musi-
cian, butin this case it simply made
a generational statement.

It has been awhile since Pearl
Jam’s first album, Ten, which sold
over six million copies. Unfortu-
nately, the fact that Pearl Jam comes
from Seattle has caused many to
label their music as “grunge” and
dismiss it as part of a fad. Since the
widely successful release of Ten in
early 1992, critics and fans have
waited eagerly to see what move
Pearl Jam will make next. The
product, Vs., has been well worth

the wait. It shows a band that
refuses to change with success, a
band that hasn’t lost touch with its
audience and still firmly knows
how to make good music. If any-
thing, Pearl Jam has distanced it-
self from the “grunge” scene by
creating an album that defies cat-
egorization: Success hasn’t af-
fected their music in a negative
way at all.

A lot of the songs on Vs. have
an undertone of violence to them,
and a few are decidedly political,
but never pretentious. When Pearl
Jam write about subjects like gun
control and police brutality, they
don’t come across as sounding
preachy, just disturbed about things
they see around them. There is no
happy idealism on this album, and

. songs like “Drop” reflect the alien-

ation of a young generation con-
fronted with a confusing, compli-
cated world. “Troubled souls
unite,” lead singer Eddie Vedder
fairly shouts, “I am lost.”

The album opens with “Go,” a
tune with a driving drum beat and
bass line. In “Animal,” the next
song, Vedder’s howl of rage is
perfectly complemented by the
powerful guitar work of guitarists

ON THE SCENE

Stone Gossard and Mike
McCready. The third cut, “Daugh-
ter” is one of the best cuts on the
album. With its slightly acoustic
guitar sound cutting down on the
excess noise, it allows Vedder's
forceful, highly emotive voice to
be heard clearly. With the song’s
themes of generational conflict,
Vedder’s voice conveys a strong
sense of anger and dislocation.

"...Pearl Jam has dis-
tanced itself from the
'grunge' scene by creating
an album that defies

“Glorified G” begins with
upbeat drum rhythms and guitar
melody, as Vedder casually tosses
off the opening line, “Got a gun/
Fact I got two, that’s Okay man,
cause I love God.” His flippant
tone satirizes gun freaks and their
toys as the chorus continues, “Glo-
rified version of a pellet gun.”
“Dissident” is a tune reminiscent
of some of the songs on Ten, Pearl
Jarn’s' last album, and is good but
not especially interesting. I like
the wah-wah guitar in the song,
“Blood,” but the vocals and music

are somewhat noisy and on the
tuneless side. “Rats” is another
dark cut, Vedder’s voice chanting
low against the drums, then finally
singing passionately.

My two favorite cuts on the
album, “Daughter” and “Elderly
Woman Behind the Counter in a
Small Town? both showcase
Vedder’s hauntingly anguished
voice. “Elderly Woman” is espe-
cially poignant, with Vedder’s re-
flections on an anonymous woman
he sees behind a lunch counter.
Seeing the woman triggers intro-
spection into his own life, and there
is something profoundly sad about
the lyrics: “I changed by not chang-
ing at all/ Small town predicts my
fate.” His voice is full of emotion
as he cries, “My god, it’s been so
long... never dreamed you’d re-
turn.” The song ends with the soft
refrain, “Hearts and thoughts they
fade.... fade away.”

Eddie Vedder’s voice is dis-
tinct and passionate, stirring with

stark emotion, and Vs. showcases
this better than Ten. It is unclear
where Pearl Jam will find them-
selves in the future, and it remains
to be seen whether Vedder will
occupy a similar historical place as
other dark, doomed lead singers
(Jim Morrison). He’s got the cha-
risma, the looks, the powerful sexu-
ality on stage, and the enigmatic,
unsettling lyrics. His voice con-
tributes to the music’s distinctive-
ness on Vs. Drummer Dave
Abbruzzese’s percussion is very
strong throughout this album,
which is laced with a funk-influ-
enced sound. Unlike a lot of other
progressive bands, especially
bands from Seattle, Pearl Jam is
capable of creating tuneful melo-
dies that still express a great deal of
rage and discontent. Their music
has an edge to it, and the band
doesn’t stick to formulas when cre-
ating a song. Vs. is about as differ-
ent from Jen as it could be, and is
in fact, better.
