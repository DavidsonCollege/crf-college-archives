‘41-42 Board
Of Elections

Student Chooses Fifteen To
Supervise Elections This
Year

A new election board, destined to
supervise all Davidson elections dur-
ing the '41-"42

school was

at

year,

their meeting on September 23.
Bill
Taylor,

Members are as follows:
Sprunt, Chairman; Arch
Don Bell, Bob Rankin, Cam Wil-
son, Bill Faison, Alston Thomp-
son, Julien McCall, Hutch Booker,
Ed Hay, “Bill McLauchlin,; Doug
Clark, Chester Pearce, Paul Kis-
sling, George Marsh.

As in the past, the board has as
its objective the constant advance-
ment of fair and democratic elec-
tions of all Davidson leaders. To
further this end, the following rec-
ommendations were adopted at the
board’s first meeting, Wednesday,
September 24:

“(1) That the ballot boxes be set
up in the banquet hall of Cham-
bers, and sufficient members of the
Board be present to keep voters in
line.

“(2) That upon issuing a ballot
to a voter, the Board member in
charge shall write that voter’s name
on the ballot, fold the ballot, and
staple the fold in such a way as to
conceal the name. At th: same
time he shall check off the voter's
name on a list. ;

“(3)-That the ballot boxes shall
be located on another table from
the table at which the ballots are is-
sued, and that a Board member shall
check off the voter’s name a second
time on a second list as the ballot
is cast.

“(4) That these changes shall be
tried during the election of the
Junior Class president, and con-
tinued in the elections next spring
if found satisfactory.”

If these methods prove satisfac-
tory at the election of junior class
president, they will be used in the
elections next spring; if not, fur-
ther changes will be made ‘to in-
sure the secret ballot, and to fore-
stall any possible election disputes,

Student Body
Employs New
Methods For
Library Move

In a historic occasion yesterday
morning, students and
faculty members assisted in moving
the Davidson College library from
the old building to the new struc-

Davidson

ture south of Chambers. At the
suggestion of the librarian, Mr.
Chalmers Davidson, the student

body vated unanimously last Sat-
urday to participate in the transi-
tion, and the faculty granted-a half
holiday yesterday for the occasion.

After gathering in front of Cham-
bers at 8:25 A. M., according to the
plan, the students heard a_ short
talk by Dr. Cunningham before-ac-
tually starting to move the volumes.
Then -the president of the college
carried the first books, two historic
volumes, into the new building and

placed them on the shelves. The
library committee followed with
other valuable works, the band

meantime played “O, Davidson.”

Finally, the students, forming two
lines of about 300 persons each,
under the supervision of the O. D.
K. men, began to pass the books
along from person to person from
the old building to the new. A group
of students in the old library re-
moved the volumes from the shelves
and started them the line,
while at the other end another crew
placed the incoming books in their
permanent place in the stacks of
the new library.

At 10:15 a rest period was grant-
ed and soft drinks were served to
everyone “on the college.” Tt was
estimated that approximately all
the volumes in the Davidson library
should have made the journey dur-
ing the four hours allotted.

The first two volumes carried by
the president into the new building
have an important historic interest
to Davidson College. One of these,
Prucknero’s “Commentaries on The
Bible,’ a handsome folio volume
bound in calf skin, was the first
book ever owned by Davidson Col-
lege. It was presented by a friend
in Philadelphia a year before the
college opened and is still one of
the oldest volumes at Davidson,
having been published (all in Latin)
at Frankfurt Am Main in 1663,

The second historic voulme was
a French New Testament which be-
longed to Peter Stuart Ney, believed
by many to have been Marshal Ney
of France. Ney designed the seal
and wrote the motto of Davidson

Club Plans Varied Ac-
tivities For The Year

An item of particular interest to
the freshman-ctass"occurred at the
first meeting of the “D” Club Mon-
day night. It seems that the re-
establishment of the Numeral Club,
under the direction of Claude Hack-
ney and Ben Lacy, is but a matter
of time.

The Numeral Club, inactive for
the past year, when again organized
will be composed of those freshmen
who have earned their “1045” num-
erals in athletic events. The Num-
eral Club was started four years
ago with Claude Hackney as its
This club is the
only freshman organization on the
campus.

The “D” Club plans to sponsor a
School Day on November
ninth, All high school seniors, ath-
letes especially, will be invited to
nd exercise at the college to be
given for them. Afterward the Duke,
Davidson game will be played in our
stadium. This is only one of the
many progressive ideas that the
“D" Club will carry out- during the
course of the year.

In the near future plans for fur-
nishing and decorating a new meet-
ing place are to be put into action
by a committee led by Ed Hipp.
President Ed Lucas appointed the
