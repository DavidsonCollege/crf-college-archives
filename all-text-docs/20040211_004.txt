Seniors tie the knot in
College’s newest trend

By Sami JARRAH
Staff Writer

For several years, students have berated
Davidson’s lackluster dating scene.

Some students speculate that the problem is
the hefty workload. Others point out the in-
ability to see how romance and academic suc-
cess can combine. The smallness of the cam-
pus is often cited as well.

Recently, however, romance has taken hold
of several students, particularly those mem-
bers of the senior class.

This school year, over a dozen members of
the Class of 2004 have become engaged. Most
of the engagements are to current Davidson
students, while a few are to Davidson alumni
or people outside of the college community.

This bit of news should not be surprising
considering the fact that close to 10% of
Davidson alumni are married to other
Davidsonians, according to the Alumni Office.

Take the story of Betsy Pinchak ’04 and Ryan
Gentzler ’04. On September 1, 2003, Gentzler
invited Pinchak ona walk, a welcomed respite
from the chaotic apartment and long night of
studying ahead. As they walked onto the cam-
pus golf course, Gentzler began dancing with
Pinchak on the green by the third hole. When
Gentzler noticed the “ball” in the hole, he knelt
down to retrieve a ring. The rest is history.

Two of Pinchak’s suitemates in Hart Resi-
dence Hall are also engaged to be married and
plan to wed this summer.Michelle Hulme ’04
is engaged to Bobby Lippert ’04, and Alison
Heck ’04 is engaged to David Dupee ’04.

Lippert proposed to Heck on the balcony of
Lingle Chapel, where he met her during Thurs-

day night worship services in the fall of their
sophomore year. The couple will marry in
Houston on June 26.

The third roommate, Alison Heck ’04, is
engaged to David Dupee ’04. While Heck and
Dupee have knowneach other since childhood,
they both decided separately to attend Davidson
their senior year of high‘school.

After dating at Davidson for three years,
Dupee decided to ask Heck’s father for his
blessing in their marriage. He then proposed to
Heck at his family’s mountain cabin in Ken-
tucky. On the deck overlooking the snowy
mountains, David revealed a lit-up sign read-
ing, “Marry Me Alison.” A stunned and shiv-
ering Heck said yes.

The love is not confined to Hart. Brad
Bridges °04 recently proposed to Lindsey
Beebe, a former Davidson College student who
now attends Trinity University.

Bridges asked the big question in a big place:
underneath the arch in St. Louis. The couple
plans to get married this summer and live in
Dallas afterward.

The love doesn’t stop there. Erin Berry ’04
became engaged to Mike Anderson ’02 last
April. Anderson proposed in Duke Gardens in
Raleigh.

Berry was amazed at how quickly the cam-
pus knew of her engagement.

She said, “Within about three days, I felt like
the entire school knew, which is what happens
on a campus this small.”

Clearly, something has taken over the stu-
dents of ’04, and even they are not quite sure
how they got so lucky.

Heck said it best: “So that’s our story, take it
or leave it. We'll take it.”
