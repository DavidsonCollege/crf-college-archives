Jackson feels art is for everyone

When I pick up a brush or a pencil, I am in touch with my
ancestors, who, thousands of years ago, made muddy hand
prints on the wall of a cave and stepped back in wonder. A print
or another hand? I imagine from my own experience in the
studio that this wonder was tinged with fear.

Although the techniques and media have ecphaded and
become more complex over the centuries, the result is still
sympathetic magic, The artist is conjure-man. Each time is the
first time, and the challenge never ends.

That’s why I teach art. I believe that everyone can benefit
from a confrontation with self that is not controlled by an
internal verbal dialogue. Art is not simply picture- -making. Each
time the blank canvas or formless lump of clay is faced, the art-

With this in mind, David-

‘Davidson's emphasis is on
the head and the heart, as we

Thus, the advantages of the

Zimmerman. “Studio art. ma-
