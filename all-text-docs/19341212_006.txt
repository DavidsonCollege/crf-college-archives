BAILEY 10 HEAD
CLASSICAL GROUP

North Carolina State Classical
Association Elects Professor
Chairman

Professor J. C. Bailey, of the David-
son’ department of Greek, was elected
chairman of the North Carolina State
Classical Association, at a meeting of
that body held at the O. Henry Hotel
in Greensboro, Saturday, December 1.

Professor Bailey is to head the organ-
ization until it can effect a union with
the State Educational Association, which
it is hoped can bé arranged sometime
within the coming year.

This association was formed a year
ago under the auspices of Dr. L. F.
Hackeman, of Elon College, to stress the
importance of the classics in a liberal
education and to strive for better op-
portunities to study Latin in the public
As Dr. Hackeman pointed out,
there are many high schools in the state
which do not even offer elementary Latin
courses as a part of their curriculum.
Also there has been a growing tendency
to discredit the value of such courses
where offered

At the recent meeting the body heard
reports from the various committees
which- had been functioning during the
year and decided to continue the program
already begun. It was also decided that
the group could work most~ effectively
as a part of the State Educational Asso-
ciation, and plans were made to unite
with that body.

Miss Deneen, of the Woman's College
of the University of North Carolina, in
Greensboro, was chosen secretary of the
Association, which has members in al-
most all'of the leading secondary schools
and colleges in the state.

Inspector Makes Visit
To R.O.T.C. Department

A contact inspection of the R.O.T.C.
department was made Wednesday, Dec.
fifth, by Captain Thomas A. Austin. Cap-
tain Austin made the inspection instead
of Col. Reed, Corps Area Commander
in charge of R.O.T.C., who has been
ordered to Walter Reed Hospital in
Washington for observation.

The principal mission of this inspection
was to ascertain whether everything was
conducted satisfactorily in the Military
Department.

Captain Austin, as is customary, paid
a visit to President Lingle during the
morning to find whether he had any re
marks to make about the R.O.T.C. de-
partment.

At drill period, the battalion gave a
perade for the inspector.

Cercle Francais Holds
Meeting Tuesday Night

Le Cercle Francais held its weekly
meeting last night. This meeting held
a double interest for the members of
the club in that a play was given by some
of the members and plans were made
to visit girls’ colleges throughout the
state in the near future.

The work of Miss Jennie Thompson
and Miss Dot Johnson made this play
one of the outstanding events in the en-
tertainment of the French Club. © The
play was presented in French with the
feminine leads being played by Misses
Thompson and Johnson. It was such a
great success with the members that un-
doubtedly another play of the same na-
ture will be given sometime before the
spring holidays,

Although the plans for visiting the
girls’ colleges are at present incomplete,
the discussion of these plans will be con-
tinued at the next meeting of the club.
The visits will be made after Christmas
with the purpose of studying the work
of other French Clubs and interchanging
ideas with the clubs that they visit.

College Business Men
Hold Annual Meeting

Mr. F. L. Jackson, treasurer of Dav-
idson College, represented the College at
the fifteenth annual meeting of the Asso-
ciation of University and College Busi-
ness Officers of the Eastern States held
at Pinehurst, Dec. 6, 7, and 8.

Institutions from Maine to South Car-
olina and as far west as Ohio were rep-
resented as the convention got under
way with some hundred and twenty-five
delegates in attendance. The meeting
opened with a welcome address deliv-
ered by Dr. W. L. Poteat, President-
Emeritus of Wake Forest College. Dav-
idson, Wake Forest, and the University
of North Carolina acted as hosts to the
convention.

Mr. Arthur G. Wilkinson of the Uni-
versity of Delaware and President of
the Association made the President's re-
port at the Friday morning session. Other
officers of the Association were Mr.
George P. Hyde, Vice-President, and Mr.
Horace S. Ford, Secretary and Treas-
urer.

Mr. C. E. McIntosh, director of the
student aid program in North Carolina,
made one of the principal addresses of
the meeting in which he urged col-
leges to “come out of the old shell and
give sufficient thought to the mental and
social needs of students. Our colleges
need to remake their mental menus,” Mc-
Intosh said, “for the modern youth has
a palate which scorns the frothy sub-
stances which his dad used to consume
with relish.”

The meeting adjourned Saturday
night with a round table discussion of
various routine problems that come up
in a college business office.

SEASON’S GREETINGS
The ever thoughtful feline calls in to
remind-your commentator that this is the
last issue of The Davidsonian before the
holidays, so it would be the time to wish
all Wildcat supporters and every reader
of this marvelous paper a very Merry
Christmas and a most prosperous and

happy New Year.

Dr. J. M. McConnell
President History Group

(Continued from Page 1)

After his first visit, Dr. Freeman con-
tinued, Lee was not in North Carolina
in person, except when he passed through
the State on his way to Georgiaggin
1861, until 1870. However, Lee’s daugh-
ter, Mildred, with other members of her
family was enrolled in school here.

After the school year the family group
went from Raleigh to Warren White
Sulphur Springs, near Warrenton, where
Lee’s daughter, Annie, died and was
buried in late 1862. Because of this,
when Lee passed through the State in
March, 1860, he stopped in Warrenton to
visit his daughter's grave. L

He then left the State, passing through
Ralefgh, Salisbury, and Charlotte, but re-
turned in April to Wilmington. He was
proud of and deeply appreciated, Dr.
Freeman said, the kindness shown his
daughter by North Carolinians.

Lee's chief associations with the State,
however, were military, Dr. Freeman
pointed out. These associations were
classified by the speaker under six head-
ings.

First of these relationships, Dr. Free-
man continued, was Lee’s defense of the
Albemarle Sound in its relation to Nor-
falk, where the greatest of the Confed-
eracy’s Navy. Yards was located. The
second was Lee’s efforts to protect the
State from invasion.

As unofficial ambassador from Presi-
dent Jefferson Davis to'Governor Vance,
Dr. Freeman continued, Lee was con-
cerned largely with the maintenance of
cordial relations between North Carolina
and the Confederate‘ government in his
third relationship to North Carolina.

His fourth relation with the State came
through increased employment of North
Carolina troops in his army. This in-

crease was begun after Gettysburg, but
was more marked after May, 1864.

Towards the end of the war, Lee re-
lied heavily on North Carolina for
troop replacements, Dr. Freeman pointed
out, and also developed a large number
of North Carolina general officers. Lee
regarded General Pender, North Caro-
linian, killed at Gettysburg, as one of the
most promising officers in the army.

“Without the aid of North Carolina
and the reinforcement of his army by
North Carolina troops”, Dr. Freeman
said, “Lee could not have carried on the
campaigns of war during its last year.
And there was an extraordinary shift to
North Carolina general officers towards
the end of the war.”

Lee's fifth relationship with the State
was strategic, in which he was concerned
with the protection of the communica-
tions lines through the State. The ex-
istence of the army, Dr. Freeman said,
depended on railroad lines being kept
open through the State, and Lee es-
pecially exerted himself to secure the
completion of the Piedmont railroad, now
a part of the Southern, from Danville to
Greensboro, as it appeared that on this
line the fate of his army was dependent.

Phi Beta Kappa
Hears Rev. Chalmers

(Continued from Page 1)

Dr. Chalmers is an outstanding young
leader in the Southern Presbyterian
Church. He graduated from Davidson
in 1920. While a student here, he made
‘an enviable record in Scholarship as well
as in campus activities.

Ten men received bids for membership
into the Phi Beta Kappa at Davidson.
Two alumni, Rev. D. M. Chalmers and
Mr. A. L. Foscue, who was an outstand-
ing member of the class of 1920 in
scholarship, were invited into the
Gamma. Keys and certificates were pre-
sented to the new members.

Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest and larg-
est of the Greek letter fraternities for
scholastic achievement. It was estab-
lished at William and Mary College, Va.
and later it had established chapters in
other outstanding institutions. There
are now over 100 chapters and has an
enrollment of over 60,000 members.
