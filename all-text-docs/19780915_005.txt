ee counld is an ongoing thing
and the College sets what courses you'll
take and all that sort of thing. It’s an
ongoing continuum and you see, the
station will be here long after this
group, that group, the next group
goes.

Nobody is permanent, in the sense
that we all die if nothing else. It’s that
sense of inperpetuum, that it goes on.
And, as a public image, just as we send
out catalogues to prospective students,

Right.

with Earl Lawrimore, then Director of
WDAYV, the interviewer asks, ‘‘so
essentially what the College would like
to have is WDAV as it is now, with
increased power and increased quality
of programming?’’ Lawrimore answers,
“Yes, I think that about sums it up.
We're not talking about any radical
changes at all.” ‘

April 1977 The Board of Directors

unanimously passes a Statement of
Policy and Purpose, which states that
the station shall broadcast ‘‘a variety
of programs in keeping with the
standards of good taste and a college’s
duty to raise the cultural level of its
community.”

May, 1917 The deadline for applying -

for HEW funds forces the College to
prepare its application for high power
immediately, including a proposed
programming schedule. Martha Rob-
erts, head of the Communications
Department, and Duane Dittman,
Vice-President for Development, are
authorized to draw up the plans.

Roberts asks Barrett and the WDAV
Staff to design the projected program-

ming schedule of the new station. This

new schedule calls for an iricréase ofe2 ©:

Summer, 1977 Don Lovell named as
Executive Director of WDAV, be-
coming the first paid employee hired
by the College to work primarily with
WDAV.

September, 1977 The WDAV staff .

receives a copy of the HEW proposals,
and finds the schedule had been
changed to include 10 hours per day of
classical music.
October, 1977 On their own initiative,
the WDAV staff changes their opera-
ting schedule, increasing broadcast of
classical music from 4 to 6 hours a day.
October 27, 1977 The Trustees ap-
prove the application for an FM
license, restricting WDAV to 10
watts. The minutes of the meeting,
which were not released to the WDAV
staff, state condition 3: ‘That since
by its nature a broadcast station
operated for the College will have an
impact on the institution’s public
relations function, it is necessary that
the station and its programming be
closely and continuously supervised
by the College administration.”’

November, 1977 Spencer, in a letter
to Barrett, encloses an official copy of
the Statement of Policy and Purpose.

I think it has been more so nce we

that’s where for all of us the realization

sure to do this now (change to 50
percent classical programming.)

I really don’t think it’s weaseling at

personal opinion—I’m labelling a-
gain—it is that the College probably
did not make. the idea, of the college

What is the possibility at this point
of establishing another station as a
student station?’ Especially if ade-
quate student interest and support for
the high-power station does not
continue? :

Dr. Spencer in. July gave several
options. One, shutting the station
down. Or paying people. Or hiring

people outside the. College. Or, indeed ’
thé possibility you mentioned, of

having two stations, a student and a’

College station.
The thing I think that all implies is

He emphasizes the Board's authority
to “‘set policies and guidelines for the
operation and programming of the
station. % :
April 6; 19178: The Board of Directors
unanimously endorses the station’s
proposed May 1 schedule to Dr
Spencer, pointing out that 50 percent
of all music in the program schedule is
classical. (Not 50 percent of total
airtime. )

May 1, 1978 Regular programming
begins.
May 23, 1978 In a memo to the
WDAYV staff, Roberts‘again emphasi-
zes the Board’s authority, saying that
“at Dr. Spencer’s instructions, and
according to the WDAV Constitu-
tion, policy and executive decisions
are made by the Board of Directors.” °
She also notes that “‘it is the feeling of
the Board...that we have a strong and
appealing idea—a balance of pro-
gramming to meet a balance of tastes
and purposes.”

‘What is to a done with the
WDAV mess? According to
past chairman of the Media

Board Greg Hankins, ‘‘the Me-.

dia Board as stated in the
constitution does have jurisdic-
tion over WDAV.” Yet present-
ly, there is no active Media
Board. For at the end of last

- Board was established in 1977.
Then, communication problems
surrounding the initial move to

high power stirred controversy

between student staffers and
administration. . .° -

At that time, the Media
Board was simply not organized
enough to deal with the contro:
versy.

In addition, the Trustees,
WDAYV. staff, and all involved
with the station had. grown

power. Then he hoped the
Media Board could come in and
oversee the station.

Now in regard to ‘‘the
WDAV mess,” says Hankins,
“The Media Board's jurisdic-
tion is not clear.’’ In this
instance with WDAV, the
WDAV Board and the admini-

‘stration seem to have the final

say, instead of the Media Boerd,
