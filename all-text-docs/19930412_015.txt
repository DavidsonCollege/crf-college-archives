Women's Track Gearing

By Peter Hurtado

The women’s track and field
team took one more step towards a
great showing at the Southern Con-
ference meet in May with several
outstanding performances at the
Duke Invitational this past week-
end.

Carolyn Meadows led the way
for the Lady ‘Cats with a fine
3000m effort of 10:56, slicing six-
teen seconds off of her personal
best.

Karen Marshall ran a great
3000m of 10:47, which is just two
seconds off her season-best time.
Look for these two women to chal-
lenge at the Conference meet.

Heather Tarpley continued her
domination of the 400m hurdles
with a 67.1. Heather leads the

Why is Carat Weight One of The
(al Important Factors ?

Improper cutting may add weight to the stone,
and may also reduce the stone’s brilliance.

You should be aware that there is a “price break” between a0.99ct diamond

as “I carat diamonds’ On top of this, the cut may make the 0.99ct appear
larger than the'1.0ct, But all factors equal, larger diamonds have greater value.

Up for Season Finale

Conference in this event. Phuong
Nyugen led the way in the Dis-
tance Medley Relay with a great
3:57 1200m split. The squad of
Nyugen, Maria Whitehead,
Tarpley, and Marshall looked
strong throughout the race. The
800m corps of Nyugen (2:33), Jean
DeMoss (2:36), Laura Jordan
(2:36), and Jenn Brown (2:38) have
shown great improvement Since
their injuries.

Coach Beth Manson is confi-
dent pout the upcoming Confer-
ence meet, and hopes to have ev-
eryone healthy by May.

Both teams travel to Colum-
bia, SC for the Gamecock Invita-
tional this coming weckend, and
both seemed poised for a. strong
finish.

"Life is
Good" for
Albie Varoski

Albie continued from page 14
story for Albie. He suffered the
firstreal slump of his career earlicr
in the season. It scems that his
attitude had shifted so much to-
wards a team concept that he had
lost sight of his own game. He
endured a losing streak which
lasted over a month and left his
confidence frazzled. Since that
time, Albie has won three matches
in a row and has now positioned
himself to be a high seed at the
conference tournament. He com-
ments that this turnaround can be
attributed to a new way of think-
ing. “I’ve come to realize that the
team needs me as much as I need
the team.”

For whatever reason, it ap-
pears that Albie is back on track
and can now concentrate on finish-
ing off what he feels could be a
dream season. “Entering this year
we had two primary goals: beat
Virginia for our first victory over
an ACC team in seven years and
win the Southern Conference tour-
nament.” So far one goal has been
achieved. Davidson defeated UVA
5-2 earlier in the season, where
despite losing both of his matches,
Albie was by far the happiest player
on the team.

There is still a long way to go
before Davidson claims a confer-
ence title, and it will take alot more
than Albie playing his heart out.
But if all goes according to his
plan, you can probably expect to
hear that light-hearted, fun-loving
guy saying his favorite phrase,
“Life is good!”

ATTENTION:
MOVE YOUR
CAR!

The tennis parking lot
has to be cleared of
cars by noon (12:00

p.m.) on Friday, April
16 for the Southern

Conference

Tournament. Thanks.
