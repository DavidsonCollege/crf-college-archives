The “Y” expresses its gratification over
the pleasant time enjoyed at the little re-
ception given by Mrs. Martin on Thanksgiv-
ing afternoon. A good number were present
and all experienced a very enjoyable time.
Another one of these receptions will be held)

To those who are not familiar with the |
facts about the life of Warren Cox, 24, |
teaching in China, the following items con- |
cerning his life while on the campus of D. C. |
might be of interest. Warren was one of
the outstanding men of his class—an honor
man, wearer of the “D,” Phi Beta Kappa
and many other student activities and honors.
He was also a member of the Kappa Alpha
social fraternity. All in all, he stood for
the ideals and aims for which Davidson is
known and was a typical Wildcat.

Y.

Steps have already been taken to secure a
speaker for-the spring service—the “Y”
hopes to get one of the most noted ministers
in the country for these meetings.

Y—

On December 19th, the last Sunday before
Christmas, the vesper service will be the an- |
nual student musical program. A_ special
program will be gotten up, as in‘former
years, and Christmas music will be used by
the Glee Club and the Quartet, together with
the whole student body.

The “Y” plans to take up a collection of
old clothes next week, the proceeds from the |
sale of whith will go to the support of the
Mission at Crossnore. This admirable work
is under the charge of Mary Martin Sloop, |
sister of President Martin, of Davidson Col- |
lege, and she has been extraordinarily suc- |
cessful in building up a great mountain work
in this mission. She was the subject of a
feature article in the American Magazine

recently, as a tribute to the wonderful work |
she is doing,

“Why don’t you write?
ink well?”

“Yes, my ink’s well and my blind love
has regained its eye-sight.” |
