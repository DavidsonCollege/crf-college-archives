MORSE WORKS ON SCENERY
Frees Barber For Directing

Work on this week's produc-
tion of The Skin of Our Teeth
started sometime last summer
when Rupert Barber. director
of the play, began thinking
about the year’s choice of
plays.

Each year he reads widely
looking for technically possi-
ble works which can be cast
from the talent which exists in
various forms on campus and
in the community.

The range of plays is meant
to vary in a four year cycle
from Shakespeare to Ionesco
and the Theatre of the Absurd.

RUPERT BARBER

In addition to the three major
productions, there are a few
workshops and visiting per-
formances each year.

Looking for a story, we went
over to the Fine Arts building
earlier this week, and found a
drama class using their class
period to work on the sets. See-
ing a friend up on a ladder
trying to paint those shutters
that are supposed to blow up,
we ascended to hold his paint
while he touched things up.

“Now, how does that look?”

“Fine.”

“Well, come over here and
let’s see if we can't finish the
banister here and then the
wall... ." .

The next day we found a
very busy Mr. Barber upstairs
in the dressing rooms setting
out makeup trays. He was
most accommodating so we
settled down for a chat and a
chaw, as he said.

“Things are going pretty
well — hectic — but I'm
not complaining. Everybody
seems to know what to do and
what to say; but you can
never tell in an amateur per-
formance. I'm just going to sit
in the back somewhere and en-
joy it. ‘

“I mean in a professional
play you can expect. them to
reach a standard of perform-
ance and keep it night after
night, but here, as I said. you
can never tell,”

Work On Wilder’s Play
Was Hectic, =njoyable

He said a lot of things about
the making of the play. Audi-
tions are open to any one who
wants to take the time to try
out, although plays are usually
cast with students and any
ladies who happen to be
around.

‘That's another thing I have
to look for in a play: whether
or not I can fill the female
parts. We're really lucky
around here because there are
a number of interested and
able women. ,

“It's too bad, though. that
there are so many seniors who
come over here and find out
about the Fine Arts Building
and say to me, ‘If I'd only
known this was here I'd have
come more.‘

The dramatic flourish that
accompanied this statement
was inimitable.

“Tryouts are the most dif-
ficult part. You see, I work
mostly with inexperienced
people — did you know that 80
per cent of the people in these
plays have never even been in
a play before? And when
they're trying out I have to
find something that I can work
with and develop.

“Not only do I look for a
person who can act, but he
has to be able to fit in with
the rest of the cast. It’s very,
very difficult sometimes.

“Costumes get started very

early because my wife makes
them. She does a pretty good
job, too."’ Indeed she does, as
we noted in the dress rehearsal
Tuesday. The dinosaur, the
mammoth and the mini-skirts
especially came out well.

“And as for the sets, I get
Rob Williams to start planning
them at least by the end of the
summer. John Morse takes
care of building the set, so the
acting is pretty much up to
me, which is as it should be.
You know, so much of a play
is the director. He really must
be excited over a play and
want to do it or you run into
problems.”

Incidentally, we asked Mr.
Williams about these sets. He
said that they never complete-
ly gel. ‘but the blue set (the
Antrobus’ living room) is
based on Picasso's Blue Peri-
od: depressing and deathly.
The colors of the carnival
come from the flat, gaudy
colors of comic books. The set
is flat and more or less color.
less so the costumes will be
brilliant in contrast.

The general impression one
got was that everyone at work

on The Skin of Our Teeth was:

telaxed and cheerful.

There were stresses and
strains of deadlines and cur-
tains, but neither prevented
the play from producing an en.
joyable evening.
