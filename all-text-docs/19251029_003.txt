LUCIAN WELLS

The work of Wells in the Davidson back-
field this year has been one of bright

spots in team’s play.

Fresh, if you think this place is dead
all we ask you to do is to take a trip to
Mount Mourne; just one trip.

Roland Parker was giving his opinion of
a student's answer to the professor's ques-
tion the other day, and summarised by say-

But here he was interrupted by the profes-

cally speaking—"

Than just stick around and deceive ’em,

campus we judge that about three-|
fourths of the student body are taking |
monkey-gland treatment. : |
