Wayman complimented the fresh-

wish that the three upper classes
would strive to match it.

“These pep meetings will have to

K. A’S Pledge

After a week of "vigorous, rushing,
Davidson's Sigma chapter of Kappa
Alpha Order takes pleasure in an-
nouncing the pledging of seventeen
boys. The new Knights are Ed Man-
get, Jimmy Hill, Heyward McDon-
ald, Bob Stokes, Burke Ingrama, Os-
borne Young, John Lawson, John
Collins, Bill Nichols, Murphy Wilds,
Jack Butke, Lee Brown, Tom Belk,
Shepherd Dunn, Tommy _ Speas,
Clayton Schofield, and Vance Watt.

With the addition of these seven-
teen slicksters, the majority of the
chapter retired to Charlotte or other
{points to get all the fun they could,
while at Wilmington, Bonny Ben

and Scotty Paterson aided the Cats
no end in their battle with State.

The entire chapter wishes to thank
faculty brothers, Lt. Spencer, Dr.
Richards, Dean Bailey, Mr. Jackson
and Dr. McGavock for their attend-
ance at Saturday night’s pledge cere-
mony.

Sporting Spees

After a most successful rush
week, most. Sig Eps stayed on the
campus and vicinity to relax. Not
content to -rémattr on~ the campus,
lowever, were Price Gwynn, Hun-
ter Dalton, and “Baldy’ Behrman
who Visited the girls at W. C. and
High Point. Of course there were
the usual trips to Charlotte and
Queens.

Looking over the members and es-
pecially the pledges, the Spees find
that the prospects for the 1942 fra-
ternity footbalal team look very
good. With the combined eforts of
seasoned men from last year and the
pledges, the SPE’s should be set for
many wins this season. Also, with
the aid of some freshmen, the Sig
Eps should have a chance to suc-
cessfully defend the basketball
championship which they won last
year.

Sigmas Celebrate

Most of the brothers of the Kap-
pa Sigma fraternity stayed on the
campus Saturday night for. the
pledging - ceremony. | Afterwards,
some of the brothers adjourned to
Charlotte for a celebration.

Those Sigmas who went with the
team to Wilmington for the David-

son N. C. State football game were:
Ehly, Ben Lacy, Booth, Taylor, Wil-
liams, Simmons, and Tommy Peters.

Daniels went in the capacity of
manager, and Sutton as spotter.
Pikas Peaceful
Most of the chapter spent | the

weekend on campus after the Rush
Week excitement; but a few man-
aged-to make the trek to Charlotte,
among them Brothers Maxwell,
Shelton, Brinson, and Pledges Far-
rar, Pracht, Raynal, and the two
“Stwoops.” :

Several of the more industrious
(?) brothers and pledges spent a
good part of the weekend house-
painting.

The chapter welcomed several al-
umni members during the week,
among them Brothers John Scott,
Vernon Youngblood, and Satterfield]
