Acceptance

In his acceptance, Dr. Davidson
expressed the appreciation on the
part of Davidson College for the
generosity of the James H. Lane
Chapter of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy who gave Con-
federate flag which was presented
to the college in 1935.

In speaking of the Soutliern hero
whom the ceremohy honored, he
said: “That the picture of Robert
FE. Lee should hang in the library
of Dayidson. College—seemsto—me
Beculiarly fitting, He was not a
Carolinian, but a Virginian, not a
Presbyterian but an Episcopalian,

yet the same anti-bellum spirit
which produced Robert E. Lee
moulded Davidson College. The

same ideal of loyalty to our own
people and loyalty to the faith of
our fathers pervades this institution
as it did Robert E. Lee.”
