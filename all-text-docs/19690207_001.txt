SGA
Ratifies

Revision

By a narrow margin, the
student hody ratified yester-
day an amendment to the
SGA Constitution making the
Senate Executive Committee
appointive rather than elect-
ed by the Senate. The vote
was about 490.30.

Although the vote was
overwhelmingly in favor of
the change, only a bare maj.
ority of the SGA voted. For
an amendment to pass. at
least a majority of the SGA
must vote, and of those vot-
ing, at least two-thirds must
vote in favor.

The amendment’ was ap
proved by the constitutional
convention in. written bailot-
ing late Wednesday night and:
in the early hours of Thurs
day morning after the con.
vention had adjourned for
lack of 4 quorum.

peals.

and Dean of Students Rich

The main provisions of the
writ of order to the Senate
included the criticisms that
election bylaws are ‘‘an un
godly mess’ and that SGA
record keeping is ‘‘incom.
prehensible at best and a
farce at worst.”

Election Laws

The writ also ordered the
Senate to obey the constitu
tion, with respect to appoint-
ment, which the court says
is an executive. not a legisla-
tive power except in appoint-
ment of a constitutional con-
yention and of Senate officers
and committees.

Another main provision
ordered reapportionment of
the Senate. so that represen

by 20 percent, as opposed to
the present variance of up
to 62 percent. By provision
of the writ. the Class of. ‘69,
