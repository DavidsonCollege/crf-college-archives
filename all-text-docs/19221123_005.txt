Football Dope

Now that the gridiron season is fast draw-
ing to a close, the dopester is in quite a coma
to pick the best eleven of the year. It seems,
even more than usual, that no team has
enough good points to be of championship
calibre. Take, for example, the Asheville
Normal School of Physical Education, which
has a team with wonderful backs, but abso-
lutely no line. Whereas a line is the only
thing developed by the Martin School for
Speech Correction, the same is true of the
State School of Elocution and Oratory.

One team, from which wonders were ex-

NTO the making of. the
shoes which wil be shown
by our representativ this
seazon, there has gone the
style sense of designers in-
fluenced by the demands of
younger men. Youth wil be

nition of this fact-is back of
the ularity of the John

of collegians.

pected seems to be particularly stiff and dead,
this is the one from the National Embalm-
er's College. Probably the liveliest team and
the one always on the jump is from Doctor
Whitton’s School for Nervous Children.
The International School of Correspond-
etice’s eleven has a number of cross plays,
which they claim wonders for. The Atlanta
School of Photography has considerable snap
and flash but so far has failed to develop
anything worth while. "The most consistent
gains have been made by Madame X’s How
to Get Fat School. There is some question
as to whether the best footwork on the grid-
iron is being done by the Russian School of
Dancing team, or by the Associated Chiro-
podists’ eleven. Taking everything in con-
sideration, the survey shows that the best all-
round team is the one representing Wm.
Watson’s Beef ‘Trust Chorus ‘Training
School,

Didn't “Red” Edgerton display the “Wim,
win, and wigor” on the field last Saturday in

Joe Bostick—“Please hold this stogie while

A MERRY DRAMA

In Many Acts and Numberless

Scenes
By Ibsen Shaw Milne.

Characters: “Mack” Lennox, a rather
Prominent senior; he prides himself on the
nobbiness of his wardrobe; it is his private
opinion that he is a veritable lady-killer,

“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate #nd no less
prominent junior; in matter of dress, his
taste is more conservative and substantial;
in regard to his love affairs the old adage,
“Still water runs deep,” is applicable. -

ACT THE TENTH,
The Tale of a Sheep.

(The Freshman here introduced craves in-
formation on the subject of dress—let us
hope that he follows the advice he gets).

Mack—How's this for a poem?

Bill—(shaving) Through the encompass-
ing laher—Have a heart, I’m defenseless.

so bad after all.

Fresh—Say Bill where are you going.

Bill—Ask me no questions and I'll tell
you no lies.

Fresh—As you will—but say you are sport-
ing the glad rags.

Bill—Rags a la Jakey Smith me son,
verdad ?

Mack—Talk English.

Bill—I will.

Fresh—Say those socks look the stuff,

Bill—They are.

Fresh—Where didst get?

Bill—Charlotte, Ed Mellon’s, Interwoven’s.

Fresh—Nuf Sed.

But I’m interested in the cost.

- Bill—This pair I have on—silk and woot—
cost’me a dollar. Over there in my trunk
I've some that cost me one buck and four
bits and a couple o’ pair that set me back
only six bits. Darn good socks, too.

Fresh—Think that I/will have to get some
next time I go down.—adv.

If you asked a girl, “How old are you?”—
it wouldn't mean anything if you were a
census taker. But if you weren't it might
mean a few letters less a week in the P. O.
box.

If a man came up to you and said, “Here’s
twenty dollars”—it wouldn't mean anything
if he were inebriated. But if he were not
you would have to page Mr. Diogenes and
tell him about it.

you please see me home?’—it doesn’t mean
anything. But—

Price—Do you know why our tank is like

Hurd—No, why?

Price—Because it stands high in the com-
munity and is rarely ever full

Well, if they really must wear these rib-

J. ©. O'Brien's minstrels certainly received
a “green” reception on the eve of their per-
formance. By the term, “green” is meant the
wilful and malicious throwing of “mock
oranges.” The personnel of the minstrel
well remembering the actions of the famous
KU KLUX KLAN made haste their de-
parture and the setting sun found them ina
new voting precinct.

Decorated

Uncle Baxter who is the latest acquisition
to Uncle Sam's forces in Davidson, and who
has shown marvelous proficiency in plain and
fancy paper sticking is in line for the honor
of the D, O. D. M. C. (Distinguished Order
Dilapidated Mail Carriers). This is anJ
honor to which we all might aspire and we]
should congratulate Baxter for his promo-
tion,

The latest song hit, a plaintive little bal-
lad, entitled—"I’ve named my old cow David-
son, because she's been dry so long.”

Incomplete
A girl wrote to her brother in college
and asked him if it would be possible for him
to send her a “forward pass” so she could
go to the next game for nothing. The girl
says she is very fond of sports. She must
be!

Fresh Bachman—Man can't live on bread

Fresh Crane-—No, pass the water.

SUNDAY GOLF TAKES ON
MATRIMONIAL ASPECT

“What God has joined tdether, let no
man put asunder,” were the words spoken
in the yard of the cabin on the golf links
Sunday afternoon when Mac, the dusky chef
of Thompson's boarding house, was united
in matrimony to the preparer of victuals at
Mrs. Bramlett’s.

At 3:10 ‘they bridal procession proceeded
from the interidr of’ the cabin to the se-
lected spot under a tree and the ceremony
was begun.

The bride, who was a comely brunette, p-
peared dressed in a blue dress and with a
beautiful white rose in her hair, a pleasing
contrast to her general appearance. The
bridesmaid wore a costume of solid white
and carried out well her color scheme of
black and white.

The groom throughout the entire ceremony
appeared as the happiest of men, wearing a
smile from ear to ear, the effect of which
was felt and evidenced by many of the guests
and spectators. The guests included the col-
ored people of the town and surrounding
community.

The wedding was wit d by many of

Circle of Davidson gave a pageant entitled
“Christianizing America.” Miss Susie Brady
represented America, while Mrs, Dusenbury
took the part of the Southern church. Miss
Jean Martin represented Home Missions.
The other 12 or 15 of the cast represented
the methods for carrying on the work of the
missions, and the needs in the home mission
