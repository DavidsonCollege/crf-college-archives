CAT TALES

BY JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Sports Editor

A CHANCE TO GET SOMETHING DONE

Davidson's present athletic facilities are, at best,
only adequate. Now we have a chance to get something
done about them.

Our athletic facilities are being evaluated this year,|

along with all other areas of the school, for the Southern

Association’s self-evaluation program. The Physical Plant]
Committee has submitted its self-evaluation to the Steer-|'

ing Committee, which will decide on the final report for
the evaluation.

Heading the list of pressing needs are additional bas-
ketball and handball courts. Athletic Director Tom Scott
notes, “There is no doubt but that basketball and handball
facilities are our most pressing need. With the varsity
and freshman teams practicing most of the time during
basketball season and the IMAC having to work its sched-
ule around the practice sessions, the courts are seldom
available, except on Sunday afternoons, for students to
play on their own.

The present facilities are adequate for the varsity,
and freshman teams’ use, but, as Dr. Scott notes, “What
we need are additional courts in order to fulfill the needs
of the student body.”

Handball presents a similar problem. Davidson has
only three handball courts, and they are almost always
busy when they are open. During the winter. months, it
is usually necessary to wait in line in order to play.

Basketball and handball are the only indoor sports
available and thus the only winter sports available. Since
the facilities for these sports are almost always over
crowded, improvements in these areas are a necessity if
the athletic facilities are to be brought to a level at which
they fulfill the students’ needs.

One wonders why the improvements aren’t made
when the cost is considered. Figuring a liberal estimate
at $15 per square foot, an addition, including two basket-
ball courts, three handball courts, additional dressing
rooms and a weight room, could be made at the back end
of the gymnasium (facing the lower tennis courts) for ap-
proximately $250,000.

This sum is hardly excessive when one considers
that it would alleviate a definite inadequacy in Davidson's
physical plant and when one compares it with the $324,-
000 being spent on renovation of the Student Union
($124,000 last year plus $200,000 this year).

Dr. Scott further points out that a gymnasium addi-
tion could be opened without having to open up the en-
tire gym, thus allowing students to play, at times when
conditions aren’t crowded, without using heat and elec-
tricity for the entire building.

GOLF FACILITIES?

A third major area in which there is definite need of
students is golf. Even several girls’ schools have some
sort of golf facilities, while Davidson students have to
travel ten miles to Mooresville, pay a dollar, and then
wait in line in order to play golf. Since the college owns
the farm land behind the driving range, this area could
be used for the construction of a golf course.

Three holes could be built at first, and the surround-
ing college land would permit expansion to proceed later
as finances permit. A par three, a par four, and a par
five hole could be constructed with most of the normal
obstacles—sand traps, bunkers, water hazard, etc.—that
a golfer encounters on a regular course.

Such a course would enable a student to go out and
play two or three holes, as time permits, and thus keep
in practice without paying money and killing an entire
afternoon. Many golf playing students don’t play at Da-
vidson because of the inconveniences of getting a course
to play on.

Such a course would also help the golf team, which
has the same problem as the other students in finding a
course and time to practice.

Dr. Scott notes that such a layout could be built very
inexpensively since the school could provide the labor
and that, with just a three hole course, golf could be
added to the curriculum.

The above mentioned items are only the major and
most pressing needs in the athletic physical plant. The
evaluation list brings out many more inadequacies.

Hard surface tennis courts are needed so that stu-
dents can play in damp weather and during the winter
months when weather permits. The existing clay courts,
although fairly adequate when in use, are kept in condi-
tion only during about four and a half months of the
school year. Thus no tennis can be played during half
the year. :

Another swimming pooi is needed for the winter
months, as the varsity and freshman teams keep occupied
during the afternoon the only one we have now.
Another football practice field is needed so that the
stadium turf won’t have to be torn up in practice. Even
most high schools don't have to practice on their stadium
field.

Adequate lighting for Ricardson Field would enable
Davidson to schedule night games at home. This would
alleviate the problems of sweltering September and Octo-
ber weather and would probably help attendance.

A tin roof needs to be extended from the back of
the visitors’ stands so that the baseball and track teams
can have at least some area to work out in during bad
weather.

The majority of the deficiencies relate to the entire
student body’s needs rather than to needs of varsity
teams, although there are inadequacies in this area also.

As | understand it, the Southern Association’s self-
evaluation program, in addition to accreditation purposes,
is conducted so that its members can see their own defi-
ciencies and do something about them. :

The Physical Plant Committee has enabled Davidson
to see its deficiencies—now what?

ODDS AND ENDS

Tennis Coach Harry Fogleman is now serving as a
consultant for Spalding sports equipment, designing and
testing both tennis and soccer equipment.

A tennis racket of his design will be on the market
next fall, carrying his autograph on it and selling for $21.

Hard ngs have been caused in several instances
this spring in which IMAC umpires of referees have made
weed le calls in favor of their fraternity. Biased or
not, the umpires will make mistakes, but the hard feelings
could easily be eliminated if the IMAC would simply a

college tennis teams.

Sonny Graves has nothing to say this week.

Coach Tom Stevens’ base-
ball team parlayed their
newly discovered power and
good pitching into a three-
game win streak last week
as they downed Belmont Ab-

twice, 4-3 and 7-1.

In the Belmont Abbey encoun
ter, ‘Cat shortstop Rick Smyre
continued his late-season hot
streak by pounding out two dou

which included seven extra-base
hits.

Dave Johnson started the
game for Davidson and picked
up the win by surviving — five
shaky. innings. He tired in the
sixth and was replaced by How
ard Bryan, who pitched perfect
ball for the rest of the game.

Smyre continued his power hit

Cole pitched one of his best
games of the season, allowing

run. He struck out eight and
walked none.

Whittle continued, ‘‘Our sprint

good chance in the intermediate
hurdles, and Billy Mills should
