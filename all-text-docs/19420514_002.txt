Credit, Where Due...

Due credit should be accorded Ralph
Clontz and his assistants in their part
on the drive for the sale of war bonds
which they conducted on the campus last
week.

Of course their was no compunction
about making pledges to this eatise, but
it seems a shame that 100 per cent of the

student body could not find it posstble-

to pledge something, however small. It
always rankles to have surrounding in-
stitutions_(one_in_particular)_show bet-
ter results than ours in anything, but
especially in the matter of patriotism.
Sonfétimes we find ourselves’ urged
todaugh at different phases of work or
campus life because of the nature of the
work itself or because of some individual
With it. We often tend to
make fun of boys because they _are ready

connected

to expend energy in activities that are
really more worthwhile than the more
“socially approved” channels.

Vhis, it seems, is another evidence of
the Davidson sense of humor, which,
although it is embarassing at, times, we
hope will continue in spirit as long as the
college itself. :
+» Usually when the results are tabu-
lated it’ is found that as a whole the
students come through pretty well on
every project put before them, which is
certainly often enough, in our opinion.

Success...

We have voiced our approval of the
idea of the celebration of Mother's Day
before, but the actual event deserves even
more praise,

Plans were tastefully arranged so that
the mothers were able to take in every-

thing without rushing, and so that they

were still able to find time to visit in-
formally with their sons and the other
mothers.

We were impressed by the pulchritude
of the group of mothers in attendance,
Perhaps plans for the next occasion

should include a Mothers’ beauty con-

test. .
When asked if he looked forward to
a better celebration next year, Mr.

Payne, Alumni Secretary, evidenced his
satisfaction in this year’s program by
replying, “There may be more mothers
here to enjoy the next one, but I don’t
see how it could be any better.”

Your Navy needs trained men.
Trained men to become Naval
Officers! And your college is ready
to give you that training now.

Here’s New Navy Plan

If you’re 17 and not yet 20, you en-
list now as an Appfentice Seaman
in the Naval Reserve. You then
continue in college, including in
your studies courses stressing phys-
ical training, mathematics and
physics. After you successfully
complete 114 calendar years of col-
lege work, you will be given a clas-
sification test.

Aviation Officers
If you qualify by this test, you
may volunteer to become a Naval

Aviation Oflicer. In this case, you
will be permitted to finish the sec-

‘before you start your training to
become a Flying Officer:
However, at any time during
this two-year period after you have
reached your 18th birthday, you
may, if you so desire, take the pre-
scribed examination for Aviation
Officer“. . . and, if successful, be
assigned for Aviation training. Stu-
dents who fail in their college
courses, or who withdraw from
college, will also have the privilege
of taking the Aviation examination.

Deck or Engineering Officers

tion test and do not volunteer for
