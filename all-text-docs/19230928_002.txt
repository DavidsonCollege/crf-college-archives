NEW FOOTBALL UNIFORMS
Embody Improvements

The football uniforms of this season
are quite different from those of last
season. The jerseys are red with small
black numerals on them, while those
of last vear’s team were of a darker
shade of red and had large white
numerals which were very prominent.
The leather elbow pads are a_ very
noticeable feature of the new jersey
and dispense with the elbow pads which
had to be worn over last season’s jer-
sey. The pads in the breeches of this
season’s unform are in a solid piece
which fit. snugly over the leg and are
more comfortable than pads wrich are
in slats. The sox of this year’s uni-
form are of a solid red which matches
the jersey.

The following is a list of men who
drew jerseys, with their respective
numerals: Faison, 1; Hendrix,

Sappenfield, 3; Mallory, 5; DeArmon, |

6; Vance, 7; Cox, Phil., 8; White, H.
M., 9; Buck, 10; Patterson, 11; Hunt-
er, 12; Hunt, 13; Davis, 16; Cox, 17;
Baker, 18; .\lexander, 19; Long, 21;
Fenton, 22; Boggs, 23; Covington, 24;
Fields, 26; Shepard, 29; Black, 30;
Anderson, 31; Laird, 32; Hodgen, 35;
Summers, 36.

MANY ASPIRANTS FOR
VARSITY TENNIS HONORS

Outside of football the interest in
athletic circles of Davidson College is
turning toward tennis. This is evinced
by the large number of entrees for the
annual tennis classic at Davidson. Be-
ginning Monday the local understudies
of Tilden will vie with each other for
the honors of the school and for some
ten days the twang of the raquet will
be heard from the Gym to the Chem.
Lab.

The entry list shows a number of
names well past the half century mark,
and among these contestants is a lot of
likely looking material, From all re-
ports there is going to be a spirited
fight for the place left vacant last year
on the team by the passing of Bradley.

Three letter men are left from last
year’s team which will make the nu-
cleus of this year’s squad. These are
Staley, Price, and Beall, who, with
Hugh Bradley, made up the victorious
outfit of last year, The team last spring
made a clean sweep of Clemson and

V. M. I., beat W. & L. 4 to’2, tied V.
P. I., and in the Carolina state tourna- |
ment tied Carolina for first honors. |
The only reverse was given by Carolina |
on the local courts in a post-season |
series, 5 to 1. With these excellent
players back a successful season is pre-
dicted,

It is thought that D. C. is on the
verge of a new era in tennis from the
interest that is now taken in this sport,
not only by the students, but by those
in authority. Three new tennis courts
are to be constructed this fall and more
are to come this spring. These together
with the number of students now go-
ing out for tennis should develop plenty
of good material for future teams.

At present, negotiations are in prog-
ress for two or three matches to be
played during the autumn. If things
pan out favorably, Carolina, Trinity,
'and Wake Forest will be taken on in
This
far in advance it is not known whether
these matches can be arranged, but it
is hoped that the team will be able to
take a trip through North Carolina this
fall.

TRACK PROSPECTS BRIGHT
FOR APPROACHING SEASON.

Within a couple of weeks the call
for fall practice for the track team
will he sounded by Coach Younger and
Captain Streibich and with eight letter
men returning to form the nucleus, the |
prospects are bright for a good team. |
As the Richardson Athletic Field nears
completion with all the modern advant-
ages for a track team, the feet of the
grey-hounds of the cinder path are
itching for the “feel” of the track. |

The following are the letter men re-!

turning to Davidson: Captain C. M. |
| Streibich, high hurdles, pole vault and |
broad jump, holder of the Davidson |
| College record for the pole vault ; Man- |
ager Red McComb, who broke the |
javelin record last year; W. M. Gracey, !
who has won several first places in|
‘hurdles and pole vaults at the past-state |
meets ; Hed Koenig, who was the flash |
of the 1921 team, but was out on ac: |
count of an operation last spring ;|
Spec McConnell, holder of the college |
‘mile record; Jim Hendrix, for the
quarter mile and dashes; H. H. Linda-
mould, who showed up well with the
|weights. W. F. Galloway, captain of |
|the 1922-23 team, who ran the half
|mile, is back in school, but will prob-
ably be kept too busy with other work
to run this spring.

The cross country team will be the |
principal thing to develop this fall, for |
with the coming state cross country run
approaching, Captain Streibich. wants |
as many men out as possible when the |
| track is completed.

Chapel Hill, and Williford, will both be |
back from the last vear’s team.

In a short time the exact date for
the class track meet here will be de-
cided, The class winning the largest
number of points at this meet will be

,the line-up.

There’s a fellow named Martin down
on the P. C, squad, The only thing we
have against him is that he is “Piggy”
Martin’s brother, “Piggy” says that
he’s going down to Rock Hill to help
carry “Bubber” to the hospital.

what's become of the Wildcat’s howl.
It’s too bad that the Herald thinks

Wildcats have started out this year to
use their claws and make the other

Reports from V. P. I. say that the
Gobblers miss Wallace, Hardwick,
Wilson, Moore and Tilson. We reckon
they do miss them, Some of those oth-
ér names sound like Davidson, 7, V. P.
1., 7. Get in there and scrap ’em this
year, Wildcats.

{ps

All the dope points to a scrap to the
finish down in Rock Hill, Friday. In
four years neither the Bluestockings
nor the Red and Black have been able.
to score more than a touchdown a
game. The South Carolinians have a
one point margin. Something is due

jto break this year—but not the Wild-

cats,

The report is that “the reliable Heck-

man” is back in harness with the Wake |

Forest Baptists; Heckman has spoiled
the Red and Blacks’ joy twice already
in the annual battle on Wearn Field,
and is always a dangerous man.

Trinity has‘a squad of 120 men, in-

returned from the team of '21. In
other words the Methodists have a
ready-made team, while Coach Monk
has the chance to make one to order,

| FRESHMEN GIVEN STIFF
TRAINING IN YELLING
| Bert:
| The Davidson student body is well
‘known for the loyal support that it
vives its athletic teams and a large
| part of the training of every Freshman
lat Davidson consists in learning the
‘college songs and yells. This year the
!new men have been put through their
paces by Okey Allison and his loyal
corps of efficient assistants. Practice
began last Friday night a week ago and
lhas been continued every day since.
|The first night was merely a starter,
|but beginning on’ Monday night the
| Freshmen were put through in dead
jearnest. On Tuesday night Faison, the
lcaptain of the football team, made a
| short talk on the immense value to the
|team of real support. On Wednesday
jnight Hendrix made a talk on the same
|line and Gig Shepherd spoke on Thurs-
|day night.

| Asa result of this practice the Fresh
|have been doing as well as could be ex-
|pected. A new yell, the clap yell, has
| been learned already and several more
fare to be learned during the year.

| At present it seems as if the upper-
jclassmen are depending on the Fresh
/to do all the yelling. At the Elon game
fat least three-fourths of the noice was
imade by the new men, While it is
eminently fitting tat this noise should
he made, yet the upperclassmen could
do a little more and not hurt them-
selves. Let's all get in behind this
team of ours and give it the support
that it so richly deserves,

in the ultimate realities of the spiritual
life. It is my purpose in this lecture to

these tendencies and then to suggest to

army which is waging a desperate bat-
tle for the maintenance of faith and
loyalty and idealism. This is why I
have entitled this lecture The Fight for
Idealism in America.

“I use the term ‘idealism’ in no tech-
nical sense, that is not in a strictly
philosophical sense. In practical ethics
it is the opposite of utilitarism, in
philosophy of materialism and deter-
minism, in literature of realism or, bet-
ter still, naturalism. Necessarily an
indifferent man or pessimist or a cynic
cannot be an idealist at the same.

“The fundamental trouble with much
of the restlessness and pessimism of
the present time is a lack of courage—
courage to face the difficulties of life
jand the deficiencies of thinking.

“Tf we cannot know all within the

ihuman lock, is it not worth while to|

|know something, and yet more and
more? If we cannot attain to pure

(glory than can ever be realized? And
is it not worth while to trace love’s
| faint beginnings. in mankind, to see the
|light of love shining over the home

real hope for the future of mankind.

ious Experience, in which he practically
said to scientists and psychologists,
‘You have studied every other fact in
the universe from the scientific stand-
point except religion, and that is the
most important fact of all.” Shall we
not say, then, that in considering the
conflict which we have outlined in this
lecture, we cannot leave out of consid-
eration the most vital of all facts.”
