Lord and Lady search for hope

By LYMAN COLLINS
Executive Editor

“When you work with people as
I've worked with people you become
devoted to them naturally. It was my
business to absorb myself in them and
to make their aims my aims. We were
working not against each other but
together.”

In this manner Woodrow Wilson
Visiting Fellow Lord Caradon ex-
pressed his personal devotion to the
people he has served throughout his
long career in the British Colonial
Service.

His career has been filled with ‘the
joy of working with people you are not
governing, but serving.”

Reminiscing on the many joys and
occasional tribulations that both she
and her husband have experienced in
their year of living throughout the
world, Lady Caradon told of the
sometimes hectic life of a Governor
General and his lady.

“T always arrived after he did. I'm
reminded of a book written by a
woman in about 1942 called Pack and
Follow and this could have been the
story of my life,’’ she explained.

The leader of the country, later
known as King Abdullah, had two
wives one very dignified and
formal, the other fat and jolly. Both
women lived a harem-like life and

seldom went beyond the palace.

But Lady Caradon persuaded Ab-
dullah to allow them to come to her
home after the hospital had been
bombed in Cairo to make bandages
and pajamas for the patients there.

“They were so pleased that they
were making their contribution to the
war effort. They sat down and made
pajamas, most of them made wrong.”

“But they worked hard and they
chatted and they enjoyed it and they
were happy.”

‘‘What I’m trying to do in the
Middle East is search for solutions --
not take sides. So many people are
concerned with abusing their oppo-
nents, justifying their own positions.
I’m not interested in that.

“I believe we should be thinking
about how we can make the world a
better place, not by one great country
in the world doing it to the exclusion
of everyone else, but everyone work-
ing together.”

Both Lord and Lady Caradon

“I'm grateful for the fact that we
seem to have never-ending opportuni-
ties to go and serve somewhere
however humble,’’ Lady Caradon
said.

For Lord Caradon ‘‘the opportuni-
ties to work with individuals of
outstanding capacities like Nyerere,
Hussein, and of course Adlai Steven-
son’ has been the most rewarding
aspect of his career.

But Lord Caradon also values his
experiences with the common people

‘‘And in the end they got a
telegram from Cairo thanking them.
It was a wonderful experience,’’ she
explained.

Lord Caradon, a firm believer in
“the obligation of optimism’’, con-
tinues to work for a settlement in the
Middle East where he has worked
much of his life.

“You've got to believe that it is
possible to act effectively; otherwise
everything you do is useless, worth-

affirmed their belief in mankind.

Lady Caradon explained, ‘You can
find human beings marvelous if you
don’t shut yourself in yourself. All
you have to do is show you are keen
and interested and believe they are
good, and you will find they are
good.”

Despite the long separations and
the pain of having to educate their
children in England, Lord and Lady
Caradon have found their experiences

Faculty okays reduced load

By SALLIE SUMMEY
Staff Writer

In a meeting yesterday the
faculty decided that being
ahead of normal

sufficient reason for seniors to

progress is

take a reduced course load.

Chairman of the Curriculum
Requirements Committee
(CRC) Richard C. Burts said
he had also considered allow-
ing juniors, sophomores and
freshmen to take reduced
loads if they have more credits
than they need, and came to
the conclusion that j'this
would not be a wise thing to
do.”

‘Seniors are no different
from sophomores or Juniors,”
Burts said, ‘but in the case of

seniors, the circumstances are
different.’

He explained that seniors
are closer to fulfilling their
course requirements and are
therefore in a better position
to take a reduced load.

Burts described the situa-
tion as a senior privelege, a
‘trump to play when the
student needs it most.”’

But Burts also pointed out
that it is still possible for a
senior to fail, or fall behind in
the number of courses.

Burts stated that ‘“‘The act-
ion the CRC took today has no
relation to financial responsi-
bility. A student may °think
taking a fewer ‘number of
courses will bé easiét *firfanci-
ally, but it is not.” |

Contract renewal procedure
undergoes re-evaluation

By PAM CAMERRA
News Editor

Associate Professor of Polli-
tical Science and Director of
the South Asian Studies Pro-
gram Tonia Devon, who has
taught at Davidson for 3
years, was informed December
15 of the Administration's
decision to terminate her con-
tract because of her ‘“‘level of
competence effective-
ness.”

This action

and

has caused
many students and faculty
members to question the im-
partiality of the present
contract evaluations process.

remain the same: regardless of
the number of courses a stu-
dent takes.

Procedures for taking a
reduced load requires the stu-
dent to fill our a form stating
whether he wants to take one
or two courses, and his rea-
sons for requesting a reduced
load.

SGA’ President Thom
Young was pleased that the
ERC finally took an affirma-
tive stand. He expressed his
appreciation to the students
who supported the petition to
the CRC, even though the
decision was made before the
petition reached the commit-
tee.

‘j appreciate the students’
support. it was a‘good sign of
student interest,’ Young said.

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. and Vice President
for Academic Affairs T.C.
Price Zimmermann explained
toThe Davidsonian the evalu-
ation procedures that are used
in contract renewal cases.

Non-tenured faculty mem-
bers’ contracts are usually
evaluated every two years,

and at that time, the adminis-

tration decides whether or not
their contracts will be re-
newed.

Zimmermann said ‘'The
procedure in contract renewals
has been that the chairman of
the relevant departments and
I conduct the discussion and
investigation,» Zimmermann
said.

Senior members of the rele-
vant departments who have
worked closely with the pro-
fessor under evaluation are
asked to submit recommen-
dations or are interviewed. In
some cases, Junior members of
the relevant departments are
also consulted.

Zimmermann explained that
the three general criteria used
in evaluating faculty are ‘‘tea-
ching effectiveness, pro-
fessional standards, and ser-
vice to the community.”

Spencer added, ‘‘We are
looking for people who are
outstanding teachers, out-
standing persons, because we
want to have a distinguished
faculty. The nature and char-
acter of your faculty is the
most important: thing,ahout 4
college auu oy youvtave a
responsibility to try and build

a faculty that is as competant
as possible.”

‘No one is perfect in every-
thing,’ Zimmermann
dec.."*But the question that is
always on our mind is, ‘Is this
person the very best we can
have in this position?’”’

“One of the problems any-
one has in building an out-
standing faculty is weighing
the issue of competence versus
outstanding quality.”’

Zimmermann explained that
decisions are difficult when an
evaluation involves a faoulty
member who is competent but
who may not turn out to be
outstanding.”

“When someone is let go
there will always be some
question and there will always
be some students and faculty
that think it’s the wrong deci-
sion.”

“The question to be asked is
‘What is the large picture?’

conce-

Is this person the very best we
can have in this position?

“If we don't ask ourselves
that question continually,
we'll end up with a good
faculty but not an outstanding
one,’ Zimmermann elabora-
ted.

Some faculty and students
believe that Devon is such an
outstanding scholar. They
perceive irregularities in the
administration’s evaluatiorQof
Devon and question the par-
tiality and wisdom of the
decision not to renew her
contract.
