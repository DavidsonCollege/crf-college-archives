Chaplain Opposes Reagan’s Central America Policy

By DAVID VAN PELT

Davidson Chaplain Charlie
Summers saw the effects of war
on a Third-World nation last
month as part of a 21-member
Christian peace delegation visi-
ting Nicaragua. -

Summers saw in this émbat-
tled Central American nation
reasons to oppose the Reagan Ad-
ministration’s current policy of
aid to the contras seeking to over-
throw the leftist Sandanista re-
gime. “We have reason to talk
with this country. We should talk
with them, not fight with them.”

After a brief training and Bible
study session in Miami, members
of the Witness for Peace delega-
tion flew to Nicaragua on March
12 and spent ten days in
Nicaragua. According to Sum-
mers, Witness for Peace ts an or-
ganization formed two years ago
to encourage North American
Christians to visit Nicaragua and
report back to their countrymen
about the current political situa-
tion, particularly as it relates to the
church.

Summers said the group was
made up of — clergymen,
businessmen, retired people, and
several students, eleven of whom
were from North Carolina.

The group divided its visit to
Nicaragua between Managua, the
capital, and rural mountain com-
munities in northern Nicaragua,
according to Summers. One site
the group visited was the Logar-
tillo communal farm near the vil-

age of Achuapa, which contra
forces raided last December, kil-
ling six people.

Summers said the attack on
Logartillo, which he called

“hardly a military target,” typifies
the military tactics of the contras.
Tht insurgents, he said, rarely at-
tack military installations. In-
stead, they concentrate on moun-
tain villages and other isolated
civilian targets. Fhis makes the in-
surgents appear to Summers
“hardly to be freedom-fighters

liberating, the poor. It’s a kind of a

guerilla war of attrition,” he said.

Group members also heard from

villagers about the popular contra

method of kidnapping peasants

and marching them to Honduras,

Summers said.

After visiting Logartillo and
meeting with a variety of church
representatives and laborers in
Achuapa, the delegation spent
two days at another farm coopera-
tive called Los Hornos. Accord-
ing to Summers, “It has not yet
been attacked, but they’re expect-
ing it to be next on the list.” Some
delegation members balked at the
idea of helping community mem-
bers build a trench for protection
in case of attack, Summers said,
because they did not believe that
their purpose was to help con-
struct military facilities. Summers
said an elderly woman changed
their minds with a plea for her
grandchildren who would have no
other place to hide if the Contras
attack.

In Managua, the delegation
held interviews with church lead-
ers, businessmen, and journalists,
in order to collect opinions oppos-
ing and favoring the Sandanista

regime.
Summers said the religious
freedom he witnessed in

Nicaragua contradicts frequent re-
ports of religious persecution.

“Some people claim that there is
persecution of the church,” he
said. “We found no persecution of
the church.” Summers said the re-
ligious persecu ‘on prevalent in
Cuba has not come to pass in
Nicaragua. The Sandanistas “‘ac-
tively encourage Christians to
take part in government at all
levels, directly contrary to Fidel
Castro.”

Summers said the Sandinista
government is less repressed and
more open to criticism than other
Central American countries.
Nicaragua’s opposition paper, La
Pensa, is the only opposition
paper in Central America, he said.
“The people generally support the
government, and those who are
not as free to speak out.”

The Sandanista government
censors coverage ef war and shor-
tages, and suffered poor crop har-
vests last year; Summers feels that
the war has caused most of
Nicaragua’s problems. It’s “a
poor country and they’re deplet-
ing their scarce resources by hav-
ing to fight a war.” He said U.S.
aid to the rebels has caused the
Sandanistas by necessity to pursue
closer ties with the USSR and
other Eastern bloc countries.

The Sandanistas have effected
many benefits in Nicaraguan life,
Summers said. They have made
health care to all people and have
installed doctors in many remote
villages for the first time.

The infant mortality rate, he
said, has fallen from 25 percent

before the overthrow of Nicara-
guan dictator Somoza in 1979 to 2

percent now.
The Sandanistas have doubled
the number of school facilities and

clerisy because the Church was no
longer by itself powerful enough
to mold opinions inanation . . .”

The ideas that Sigmund Freud
introduced in the 19th century
have influenced 20th century at-
titudes. Freud compared “human
sexuality [to] a boiler room,” ar-
guing we “must allow the sexual
energy to come out.”

Freudianism, according to
Wolfe, has turned the Bible belt
state of North Carolina into one of
the national leaders “in pornog-
raphy outlets per capita.” He
added, “The typical Mountain
Dew crossroads of the Bible belt
in addition to Arby’s fast food

_ drive [through] . . . and hot wax
car wash . . . now has the village
brothel, a house of prostitution.”

He said pornographic theatres
and pornography in general are
now “a customary part of Ameri-
ca.” They represent “an astonish-
ing change especially in a religi-
ous country. And it’s due to the
ideas of Freud.”

Wolfe said Americans are
now reevaluating their attitudes
and ideas. He said we're “at the
end of the line for these trends I've
talked about. They've begun to
run out of momentum.”

He said one of the greatest
changes we’ ve experienced in the
last decade is “the wholesale

reevaluation of Marxism.” He
added there is no “intellectual
rationale” to excuse the existence
of Marxist concentration camps in
the USSR about which we are
learning from Russian writers.

Hence, new theories of power
have emerged, one of which
suggests “the moral equivalency
of the East and West. Morally the
USA and USSR are on equal
levels. You choose yourevils,” he
explains.

Wolfe said, “We're beginning
to see we're playing with fire in
the arts.” For example, some con-
temporary musicals feature 1950
costumes and music. He added
artists “hold
reaching out to a popular audi-
ence.”

He said, as the clerisy meets
the edueated audiences halfway,
“difficult” art must emerge.
“There must at least be a harlequin
in a black and white costume im-
personating a chicken or some-
thing.”

In addition, the modernism
that produced large 20th century
buildings with no main front door
is giving way to new architecture
and central front doors.

New computer technology in-
fluences our attitudes and
thoughts towards sex, Wolfe said.
“Like the energy in a computer,

to tenets yet are

the energy of sex is constant. The
difference is in the yes/no gates of
the system...” whereby the
human dictates when he uses the
stored energy. “This idea is com-
pletely foreign to Freud[ianism].”

Wolfe emphasized ‘There
must be some kind of reevalua-
tion. A new set of values are to be
created.” He added, “It 1s impos-
sible to go back to old values in
their old forms.”

“We must find new moral ap-
proximations,” he said. “Cities
are drawing up laws against por
nography because it violates the
civil rights of the people pic:
tured.” He added, “It’s impossible
to use the notion that pornography
is evil” because for the intellectu-
als that’s an unacceptable argu-
ment.

After the lecture, Wolfe said
in the twenty-first century we can
expect to see more ornate and dec-
orative work on such “items as
computers and spacesuits. He
added, “The serious arts [the
opera] will be much more popu-
lar . . . difficult but popular.”

As pornography will decline,
Wolfe said, Americans “will want
to feel culturally superior as well
as entertained.”

tripled the number of teachers.
The Sandanistas have also made
education free through college, he
said.

Summers said the poor
primarily benefit from the San-
danistas reform. “If you are upper
middle class or rich, you are not

affected by the program, and tend
not to like the Sandanistas.”

funding to the Contras for the
months pending Sandanista con-
cessions. “It’s a knuckleball. It's
an attempt to confuse people so
that he gets what he wants, which
is to get fourteen million dollars to
give to the Contras to do whatever
they want with it.” Instead of i
current policy, Summers said th
United States should de
guarantees on the use of military
power in exchange for interna-
tional economic aid.
