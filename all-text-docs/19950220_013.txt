Men’s Swimming takes Southerns

Women’s team finishes strong in 4th place

Over six months of 6:30 a.m.
practices, weekday and weekend
trips to away meets, and a two-
week training trip in Florida over
Christmas break all went into the
Davidson men’s and women’s
swimming and diving teams’ ef-
forts at the Southern States Swim-
ming and Diving Championships.

& DIVING

And it payed off. The men’s
team won the meet for the first
time in the meet’s four-year his-
tory, and the women placed an
impressive fourth in the three-day
competition that attracted 12 teams
from across the Southeast — from
Virginia and Washington, D.C. to
Florida.

The men emerged victorious
by a 132-point margin over sec-
ond-place Washington and Lee
University.

The Wildcats set the tone on
the first day of competition with
the first of two outstanding perfor-
mances from freshman Michael
Scarbo. Scarbo won the 500
freestyle in team and meet-record
form on Thursday. He also won

the 1650 free on Saturday, again
setting new team and meetrecords.

Junior co-captain Churchill
Hooffearned a victory forthe Wild-
cats in the 200 freestyle. He also
placed second in both the 500 and
the 1650.

Freshman Freddy Schnell was
also in top form. Schnell (which,
in German, means “fast”) won the
100 and 200 backststroke events,
also setting new team records in
the process. His 100 time was
good enough to qualify him for

_ Junior Nationals.

On the boards, the men’s div-
ing trio of freshman Jonathan Frost,
sophomore Michael Hart, and se-

- nior co-captain Thad Reece domi-

nated the competition in their
events. On 1-meter, Hart placed
first, Frost second, and Reece third;

on 3-meter, the order was Frost, :

Hart, and, in fourth place by a slim
margin, Reece. Frost and Hart tied
for the male Diver of the Meet
award.

But the performer of the meet
for the men was freshman Matt
Buck. Buck won both the 100 and
200 breaststroke, as well as the 200
individual medley. His time in the
100 breast was also a NCAA Divi-
sion I consideration time; this
means Buck has a shot at compet-
ing in the national championship
meet next month. He is the first
swimmer in Davidson history to
make a NCAA cut. His outstand-

ing performances earned him the
male Most Valuable Swimmer
award.

Key performances for the
Wildcats also came from freshman
Matt Lake, who placed highly in
the 200 and 400 IM and 200 breast,
and sophomore Tim Lim, who
scored in the 50, 100, and 200 free.

Others scoring points for the
men include senior Andrew
Hotchkiss in the 200 butterfly,
sophomore Bo Craig in the 200
backstroke, freshman Dave
Maddux in the 100 free, and junior
William Robert in the 1650.

On the women’s side, the
Wildcat swimmers and diver also
performed exceptionally well,
placing fourth in an extremely com-
petitive meet.

They were led by freshman
Heather Sweeney, who won both
the 200 and 400 IM and placed
second in the 200 breast. These
performances — all three of which
set new Davidson team records —
earned her the female Most Valu-
able Swimmer award for scoring
more points than any other female
competitor.

Sophomore Susanne Herring
also turned in top finishes for the
Wildcats. Herring won the 200
free and finished second in the 100
free and third in the 50. Her 100
free time reset her old team record.

Freshman Kelly Bolterstein
swam extremely well in the sprints
as well, finishing third in the 100
free and placing highly in both the
50 and 200 free.

Other key pefformers for the
women include freshman Allison
Beebe, who finished well in the
100 and 200 fly and 200 back, and
junior co-captain Katharine
Welling’s placings in both back-
strokes.

Also scoring points for the
Wildcats were freshman Katie
Palmer and sophomore Kathleen
Cook in the 100 and 200 fly, junior
Jennifer Schuetz in the 100 and
200 breast, and freshman Emily
Kuhlman in the 500 and 1650 free.

Southern States was the cul-
mination of extremely successful
seasons for both the men’s and
women’s teams.

“Tt is the culmination of all the
early morning practices, hard work,
and miles we logged on the road
and in the pool,” says sophomore
Kary Thompson.

At the individual level, nearly
every swimmer achieved personal
records; at the team level, the team
records speak for themselves:
“This is the first winning season
since 1981 for the men and the
highlight of Davidson swimming
since I have been here,” says Hooff.

“While we all swam well,
much of the credit goes to Rich,”

says Schnell. The men’s and
women’s head coach, Rich
DeSelm, has completely turned the
programs around in his two years
at Davidson.

“He [DeSelm] is amazing. I
have neverhad a coach as support-
ive and as talented as Rich,” says
Thompson.

DeSelm’s efforts payed off

_ tangibly at Southern States, as he

won the Men’s Coach of the Year
award.

And as he has put an enor-
mous amount of effort into build-
ing the programs, the Wildcat
swimming and diving teams should
remain forces to contend with for
years to come.

Cats put fortress around the Citadel

By Matt Pitzer

- CHARLESTON — All the
dice all came up sevens.

The cards all turned up aces.
Everything clicked.

MEN'S

BASKETBALL

Choose whatever cliche you
wish and it'll probably apply to the
men’s basketball team’s 70-51 win
over the Citadel Saturday night at
McAlister Field House.

Almost everything the Wild-
cats (13-10, 6-5 Southern Confer-
ence Northern Division) did
seemed just right. Their shots fell,

they grabbed the important re-

bounds, and they shut down the-

Bulldogs’ offense.

“This isthe way weenvisioned
this team being able to play,” coach
Bob McKillop said. “We’ ve really
been working on our confidence,
and tonight that confidence-was
apparent.”

Quinn Harwood led four play-
ers in double figures with 15 points.
Brandon Williams added 14, Ray
Minlend had 13 and Chris Alpert

. scored 10.

Davidson bounced back from
atough 91-81 loss Monday at home
to East Tennessee State, which was
its fourth loss in five games.

If the Wildcats had lost Satur-
day, they would have been danger-
ously close to falling into the bot-
tom half of the conference, forcing

the squad to play an extra game in
the conference tournament March
3-5 in Asheville.

Now, the Wildcats have amore
comfortable two-game lead over
fourth-place VMI with just three
games left in the regular season.

- “We’re back to Davidson bas-
ketball,” Williams said. “This was
exactly: everything we wanted to
do. This is how we want to play the
rest of the season and on into the
tournament.”

What the Wildcats did was
shut down the Bulldogs’ two lead-
ing scorers Moncrief Michael and
Noy Castillo.

In fact, their only weapon was
Matt Newman, who with 24 points,
scored almost half the Citadel’s
total.

Davidson, on the other hand,

tied a season-high by nailing nine
of 13 three pointers, including three
in a row to start the second half.

After taking a 32-19 halftime
lead, Alpert opened up after the
break with a big three-pointer.
Castillo responded with a long-
range bomb, but Harwood then hit
two consecutive threes, giving the
Wildcats a 41-22 lead.

“That gave us a big lift, gave
us the momentum again,”
McKillop said. “Chris starting the
second half like that gave us the
confidence to carry through to the
end.”

The Bulldogs quickly ran off
eight straight points, but Davidson
responded with a 10-2 run of its
own, giving up them an insur-
mountable 51-32 lead.

Although each team wound

up with 31 rebounds, the Wildcats
seemed to grab all the important
ones. “We got the big offensive
rebounds when we needed them,”
McKillop said.

Starters Harwood, Williams,
Jeff Anderson and George Spain
were all slowed by illness, but the
performances of Alpert and
Minlend more than made up the
difference.

Davidson travels to VMI to-
night for a 7:30 game.

Saturday, the squad heads
north again to face Marshall, be-
fore closing out the regular season
next Monday at 7:30 p.m. against
Furman.

“This is a great start to the
trip,” McKillop said. “We knew
we had our backs to the wall, and
we responded.”
