Woodmansee Resigns Post,
Chaplaincy Future Undecided

The Rev. R. Scott Woodman
see has announced his resig
nation from Davidson as college
chaplain.

Woodmansee, who has been
in the chaplaincy post since
1966 when he replaced present
Dean of Students Will H. Terry,
will become the minister of the
John Knox Presbyterian Church
in Marietta, Ga.

“We hate to leave this com
munity, for Davidson has been
good to us,”"’ Woodmansec said.
“Til miss the contact with the
students."

Woodmansee indicated, how-
ever, that he is “excited about
his new job as a pastora! min-
ister and that he feels his new
congregation will be very open
to new forms of Christian life.

College President Samuel P.
Spencer has asked Woodmansee
for both names of possible
candidates for the chaplaincy
and for some recommendations
concerning the chaplaincy at
Davidson.

According to Woodmansee,
who admits some frustration in
volved in the present) position,
four options for oa Davidson
campus Ministry were offore |
to Spencer.

One option allows for a chap-
lain-teacher, with the man fill

chaplain to both students and

this extent. It is of concern to
me that a class which began
its career in a More positive
frame of mind should turn sour
at such an early date.

ory (9 years) which IT remem-

tinued.

facuity and also teaching a
course or two to give him fac
ulty status. Woodmansee_ point
ed oul that this would allow
the chaplain a greater role in
decision making.

A second option mentioned by
Woodinansee involves having a
chaplain) in the community
sponsored by the synod of the
Presbyterian Church, similar to
Presbyterian campus ministers
on larger university campuses.
Woodmansee stressed, however,
that the synod has no money
for such a position to be open
ed.

A third option would be to
hire a chaplain who would also
serve as an associate or assist
ant minister at the college
Presbyterian Church. Wood
mansee pointed out that such
a position would broaden the

In an effort to assuage facul-
ty discontent and confusion con
cerning the issue of campus
governance, College President
Samule R. Spencer Jr. read a
statement at the faculiy meet-
ing Dec. 7 in which he clarified
the role of the Pres:dent and
trustees in relation to the fa-
culty.

Addressing himself to charges
that the trustees, in the newly
adopted by-laws, gave the presi
cent broad powers, such as to
suspend action by any group
on campus, Spencer said no
additional powers have been as-
signed to the office than pre-
viously existed in the oid by-
laws.

“Ii can be argued that the
iormer implied powers of the
President were greater, and
that making the procedure spe-
cific and limiting it to calling
for a review is a circumscrip-
tion rather than enlargement of
authority,” he said.

Concerning the issue of the

base for operation, allowing the
chaplain to work with both the
students and the greater com-
munity.

Furthermore, it would be
beneficial to the church = and
would allow the chaplain to
preach at times, freeing the
senior minister for other duties.

The final option mentioned
by Woodmansee is to keep the
chaplain’s position as it pre-
sently is, a post financed by
the college and under the ,aus-
pices of the Dean of Students.

Both Woodmansee and assist
ant to the president Greg Scott
emphasized that before a new
chaplain is named, Spencer and
the selection committee — will
look “long and hard" at the
options and will consider fully
what the chaplainey should en-
tail.

President chartering all organ-
izations on campus, Spencer
said that he will suggest at the
Spring meeting of the trustees
that the faculty in addition to
‘he President approve or dis-
approve the chartering of or-
ganizations.

Spencer said he will also re-
commend at the Spring meet-
ing that the faculty also be al-
lowed to decide along with the
trustees who shall constitute the
faculty. The by-laws adopted in

Turning his attention to the
issue of administrative appoint-

faculty, Spencer firmly estab-
lished the procedure that in the
case of major administrative
appointments, the Executive
Committee of the faculty will
be furnished with the opportu-
nity to decide whether it wish-
es on behalf of the faculty to

be consulted. ;

Spencer also said that a spe-
cial meeting of the faculty will
be called after every trustee
meeting in order that the fa-
culty may be briefed on actions
taken by the board.

On the issue of campus gov-
ernance, Spencer said that in
the past several years two
trends have emerged. The lines
of responsibility have been clar-
ified especially with regard to
the function of the President.

could have lavished more pains-
taking attention to the irksome
by-laws. _

One of the suggesitons that
this committee raised was to
drop the provision whereby the
SGA Vice President would be
President of the Residence Hall
Association, a sound idea that
would have been crucial, if nof
fatal to the RHA.

The truth of the defeated mo-
tion lies in the fact that none
of the sophomore senators toy-
ing with the idea of running for
the SGA Vice Presidency are
anxious to inherit the white
clephant RHA. The RHA’s new
constitution has dismissed sev-
eral of the functions that the
body has customarily perform-
ed for the dormitories. It will
no longer enforce rules or in-
flict fines. With the addition of
the new “house managers” the
RHA has been reduced to the
status of a cantankerous great-
aunt who strikes a_ rich ap-
pearance, but factually suffers
a flagging bank account.

A major fight on the Senate
floor served to attempt to abol-
ish the position of cheerleader.
Cecil Burney noted that such
innovative groups as the Kazoo
Band had reduced the need for
out-dated cheerleaders. Sopho-
more Cheerleader Jerry Godbe-
here said, “! think that cheer-
leaders add a lot to an athletic
contest; there’s always the
chance a girl will be dropped.
Nothing would be gained by
abolishing cheerleaders.”

Individual attention was the
crying need of the whole af-
fair. The Senate tackled a job

that reduced a multiplicity of
ideas and issues, the bulk of
which could have finished work
for an entire term of office,
into a single package bursting
at seams that were altogether
too easily split.

Joint candidacy for SGA of-
fices, various boards, and the
YMCA were logically outlawed.
in an effort to weed out con-
flicting authority in legislative
areas. The Senate stopped short
of abolishing joint candidacy
for the editorship of THE DAV-
IDSONIAN, on the force of the
argument that a single editor
might not be able to handle the
tremendous workload.

The powers of the current
SGA Chancellor Robert Strand
were increased substantially by
amendments of the by-laws, al-
though these new powers re-
flect only a fraction of those
suggested. Under the new rules,
Strand and his successors will
enjoy complete bookeeping priv-
ileges and the position of Treas-
urer of the SGA. Henceforth,
the Chancellor will be required
to have had accounting instruc-
tion to qualify for the job. An
amendment to provide for di-
rect student election of the
Chancellor was voted down;
the Senate decided that the
SGA President should retain
the power to appoint the chan-
cellor.

Freshman Vincent Rabil ap-
peared before the Senate with
a petition bearing 145 names
requesiing that the Senate by-
laws admit the legitimacy of
write-in ballots. Rabil waited at

the meeting four and a_ half:

hours before he was recognized.

When he began reading his
presentation, a four page com-
pendium of questions and spe-
culation about the election sys-
tem, he was silenced midway
through the second page by a
call for a vote by one eager
senator. Rabil’s amendment to
allow write-in votes was de-
feated.

The Senate rejected the idea
that the present Union Board
should be subservient to the
Senate, reaffirming its present
autonomous status. Several of
the senators wanted to ‘‘adopt”
the Union Board to exert great-
er control over matters of taste
like last year’s Groove Tube
debacle, when a movie sched-
uled at the Union was abruptly
cancelled.

Union Board member Danny
Berry said, ‘“‘The Senate was
trying to get control of the
Union Board, a move that would
have neglected the basic fund-
amental independence of the
two organizations.”

Ralston’s committee was not
the focus of criticism for the
Senate. Sophomore Senator John
Douglas summed up a seeming-
ly majority sentiment when he
said, “I think that the work
done by Bill Ralston’s commit-
tee and the subsequent Senate
action brought about some con-
structive changes.

“Aside from the quality of the
amendments, which, as I said,
were, for the most part con-
structive, the By-laws obviously
were in need of revision, and
it was the responsibility of the
Senate to make these renova-
tions, regardless of the time
which it may have taken.”
