Library Featu

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Contributing Editor

They may look old, dirty, and
worthless in their hogskin bin-
dings, but many volumes in the
Rare Book Collection may aptly
be called museum pieces.

If valued according to ‘‘Books
Prices Current,’’ a compilation
of auction biddings, the entire
collection would be worth close
to half a million dollars.

Not all the books in the Rare
Book Room are old, however,
and age alone’ doesn't
necessarily determine a book's
worth.

RARE BOOK ROOM

Artist’s conception of Rare Book Room in E. H. Little Library.

Chalmers Davidson, feels that a
good rule of thumb for deter-
mining a rare book is ‘that any
first edition published in the
United States before 1820 or in
Europe before 1800 qualifies.”
However, there are many 18th
century volumes which are
worth considerably less than
many of the limited edition
printings of the last decade.

A complete set of the large 45
volume ‘‘Dictionarie Rosionne
de Sciences des Arts"’ may very
well be the gem of the collec-
tion. Published by the Royal
Academy of Sciences of Paris in
pre-Bastille days, the set was
the world’s first encyclopedia.

Art Center Presents
Music Convocation

By HUGH HENNIS
Staff Writer

The Cunningham Fine Arts
Center will present the 13th
Annual Davidson College
Sacred Music Convocation
tonight and tomorrow night.

The Queens College Choir,
Davidson College Chorus and
Davidson Wind Ensemble will.
present “Glory to God,” a
cantata by Alan Hovhaness;
and “Faith and the Sewing
Circle,"’ a religious operetta by
Davidson’s Wilmer Welsh, in
the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church tonight at
8:15 p.m.

At 2 p.m. Saturday,
Marilyn Mason will present in
the college church an organ
recital featuring two works
using organ and electronic tape
players.

Also featured during the
convocation will be an opening
address by Frontis W.
Johnston, dean of the Honors
College, on ‘“‘The Puritan
Politics of Worship,” at 11 a.m.
in Hodson Hall.

Several workshops on the use
of electronic music in church
worship services are also
planned.

Mason is professor of music
and chairman of the organ
department at the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor. She
received Bachelor and Master
of Music degrees there and the
Doctor of Sacred Music degree
from Union Theological
Seminary, New York.

On periodic leaves from the
university she has performed
all over the world. Her special
interest is in performing works
by living American composers,
some of which she has
commissioned.

All concerts and workshops
are open free to all members of
the Davidson community.

The college library acquired
the complete set before Har-
vard did, but no one has any
idea of where it came from.
Davidson conjectured that the
encyclopedias may have been
brought to the college in the
1840’s by the Reverend Steven
Frontis, a French Professor
who arrived from Europe.

One of the collection'’s best
known possessions is a copy of
the ‘Breeches Bible’ which
was printed in London in 1615.

The nickname comes from its
quaint translation of one verse
in Genesis: ‘‘And they knew
that they were naked and sewed
fig leaves together to make
themselves breeches.”

The flyleaves of the old Bible
are inscribed with numerous
wedding and birth descriptions,
notations cf bills of sale, sums,
and shopping lists penned by
two generations of owners.

Sylvammus Urban's ‘‘Gen-
tleman's Magazine’’ was
published biannually in London
from 1731 to 1907. The Rare
Book Collection includes most
of the issues.

The magazine was similar to
an almanac including featured
book reviews, poetry, death
notices, political events, and in

favorable. ‘‘I think basically it
is a good idea to have some time
to think,"’ said John Steely.

“IT would suggest that
students could talk more with
their major professors or talk
with professors who teach
courses they would like to take.
Mostly, all we have seen is our
faculty advisors,” said Steely.

“It is a good program and I
thought meeting with faculty
advisors was the better part of
the conference. The conference
goes beyond the catalogue and
helps you get a clearer view of
what you need for the future,”
said Bill McTavish.

Many expressed their
thankfulness for a break from
school.

“My first reaction is that I
was grateful for the break. It
was psychologically, mentally
and physically good for me to be
released from the pressures of
classes,’ said Scott Lane.

One complaint aired by some
freshmen was that undecided
majors had_ difficulty in

planning for the next four years.

“I haven't decided on my
major, so taking two days to
plan for the next four years is
kind of general and not very
beneficial for me,” said Scott
Reid.

“It was helpful in planning
out the rest of this year,” he
said.

One of the advisors involved
in the two-day conference,
Professor of History Malcolm
Partin, said, ‘‘I feel favorable to
the idea of freshman
conferences. It is good in theory
and has given freshmen a
greater chance to think about
their schedule under a relaxed
situation.

- “It is easier on advisors also,
who don't have to worry about
all the other things that usually
preoccupy them,” Partin said.

“It is important to try and
provide the best quality of
advising possible and
Conference Days are worth
being tried as a means for
providing better counseling,”
_concluded Dean Terry.

later years analyzed the stock
market.

The Samuel Lindsey collec-
tion of over 100 books about
Robert Burns was given to the
library in 1950. It was described
by Davidson as ‘‘one of our
treasures."’ The collection in-
cludes many scarce limited
editions valued for their
aesthetic value as well as
monetary worth.

A pigskin edition of the com-
plete works of the Roman
philosopher Senca published in
Venice the year Columbus first
sailed west, and a 1495 edition
Thomas Becket's ‘‘Vita et
Processus" are highly valued
incunabuli (books printed
before 1500), and two highlights
of an assortment of old classics.

Other old books include an
autographed 1668 copy of John
Milton's ‘‘Paradise Lost,"’ a fir-
st edition set of Samuel John-
son's famous dictionaries, a
book of fables called ‘*Alciati's
Emblematum” which was prin-
ted in 1544, and a collection of
valuable Golden Cockeral Press
limited printings.

res Rare Museum Works

Every so often a book of
moderate value will be unear-
thed in the stacks and added to
the collection, but most of the
books in the Rare Book Room
were gifts to the college.

The library has no rare book .
fund in.its budget, though it will
sometimes purchase volumes to
complete a set it already owns.

Davidson called rare books
‘a good investment, and status
symbol” adding that they have
great scholarly and aesthetic
appeal as well.

In 1964 C. Alphonse Smith
gave his winnings from the
Irish sweepstakes to provide for
glass cases, shelves, air con-
ditioners, etc., for the collec-
tion.

Few students ever use the
room and many students when
questioned admitted they have
no idea who has the key, (the
key can be obtained from
anyone on the library staff.)

Davidson suggested that the
room's use might be increased
if faculty called attention to
rare book material related to
their courses.
