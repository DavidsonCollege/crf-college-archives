COMMENTS ON FEPC...

society will accept the Chinese, In-
dian, Italian, German, Russian, etc.;

other laws
to discrimination
upon color, will rectify the
present wrong with the mere action
of the Congress or the stroke of
a pen, Looking back we can see
the great progress» made by our
people toward tolerance and under-
standing of the Negro. FEPC itself
is a shining symbol of the progress
which has-been made toward com-
bating this intolerance. It is gratify-
ing that this issue is of major im-
portance in the political battles to
be staged this election year. At the
best, we can hope that the dis-
cussions will help those of us af-
flicted with intolerance and

prejudice to recognize the ill for

combat

based

what it is and not continue to keep
our right hand from knowing what
our left hand is doing.

Even if passed to become a Iaw

by Congress, FEPC would be a
poor attemp toward the elimina-
tion of racial discrimination, Rather
than propose that law be our
mechanism achieving such a
goal it would seem that it is our
duty, to take account of ourselves,
to reason out and examine the
prejudice that fouls sour reasoning.
This duty lies with the individual
to think through and form his own
unmolested conclusion rather than
acquiesce because it is the course of
least resistance.. After analysis and
test of otf stand will our southern
view still hold water? Ignorance
is the greatest ally of our prejudiced
minds. Education will combat ig-
norance and in turn clear our minds
to think properly upon this ques-
tion. If the students of colleges like
Davidson not this chal-
lenge and accept it then how can
our nation ever expect to cast off
the shackles of out-moded_ tradi-
tions?

ing all the m®mbers to enter,

At this meeting, Leighton Mc-

visors, and Haywood Brinegar and
Herb Meza were elected as first
and second critics. The program,
social, judiciary, and steering com-
mittees were appointed for the
coming term, The society voted
to assume the duties of the moni-
tors who usher the seniors at com-
mencement, No definite plans con-
cerning this have yet been made,

the vote being one of willingness to

assume. this duty. The election of

new members was announced to
take place next week.

The Phi Society was founded
early in the life of the school and
has grown up with the college,
Sam Maloney pointed out. This or-
ganization has been a center of
campus. life, and many institutions
of the school have had their origin
in the hands of the Phi, The com-

school, along with the governmen-

formally in the hands of the Phi
