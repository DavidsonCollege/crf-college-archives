Bazbo exploits clouds

By JACK GOLDEN
Staff Writer

The violet haze of the summer
evening made the clouds dance before
his eyes. They moved, it seemed to
him, as if guided by some superior
intellect. What message did they
mean to impact to him. The panorama
was so engrossing he completely
tuned out the lecture on social
patterns of post-war Janians. With an
unfaltering step he strode towards the
transparent wall of the teaching
module.

Yes, the clouds were calling to
him. Enthralled by their siren song he
pressed against the wall. Then he
saw it, the message of the gods: Flash
Bazbo, Space Cadet. He knew then
what he had to do.

“Bazbo, what the hell are you doing

| with those clouds,’ barked kindly old
spinster lady teacher, Miss — ———.

But our young hero was oblivious
to her remarks. His mind was filled
with only one thought: he, Ray A.

Bazbo, the most intelligent Beta-2 in
his form, would enter the Federation
Space Academy.

We return to the world of animation
for this week’s questions:

1. Name Popeye’s nephews.

2. Sherman and Mr. Peabody were
transported in time by the ————
machine.

3. What was the name of George of
the Jungle’s simian friend?

4. ‘‘Sufferin’ Succotash’’ was re-
peated many times by ———— and

5. What is the name of the Rubble’s
pet?

6. What transformed Super Chicken?

7. Name the three villains from
Underdog.

Bandwagon

AN ENDLESS FLOW of entertainment washed -
