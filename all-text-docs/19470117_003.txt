a

With the advent of Christmas Holidays,
Coach Norman Sheppard took his boys down to
the Wofford camp grounds and bit the Terriers
for a 55-30 decision. Though fairly easy victory
it was costly in man power with Earp suffering an
ankle injury and Williams developing a case of
stomach ailment, which put both men on the bench
for most of the Ga.-Tech tilt in Atlanta the next
night. Playing before a sparse crowd in the Tech
Gymnasium, the Wildcats put up a pesky and
unrelenting offensive and defensive game, but
couldn’t overcome the heighth ot Wes Paxon and
ended up on the little end of a 41-55 score.

Back at Davidson the quintet again engaged the Eagles
from Ashborough, bettering them by 58-47, then sallied
up to Winston-Salem to take on the Duke Blue Devils.
The Blue Devils came out on top by 55-47. ‘hen back in
Charlotte betore a record crowd the Wildcats chased
N. C. State ragged for the entire 4U minutes, but could
not out-do a tive point final lead. ‘Phe ending tally was
93-48 for the State cagers.
