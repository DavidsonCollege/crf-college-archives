The men’s and women’s in-
door track teams came back from
the Southern Conference champi-
onships at East Tennessee State
this weekend with finishes of eighth
and seventh places, respectively,

Sophomore Venessa Sims
placed fifth in the high jump forthe
women’s team, and freshman Josh
Cookson took seventh, overall, for
the men’s 5000-meter run.

Appalachian State ran away
with the men’s title, while the host
Buccaneers nabbed the women’s
crown.

Davidsoh’s men’s team,
coached by Gary Andrew, is led by

on the road, a shellacking of
Marshall at home and The Citadel
game.

The lower points, however,
have included a 24-point defeat at
the hands of UNCC and losses to
Furman, Georgia Southern and
VMI.

“Obviously if I had my finger
on the answer, I would have pulled
that lever a long time ago,” coach
Bob McKillop said. “The sands of
time are such that this will serve as
dramatic a wake-upcall as we could
have.”

Coaches and players have
talked a lot this season about con-
fidence and about reaching just the
right level of it to find success.
Obviously, that will be a huge fac-
tor going into the tournament.

~ With it, the Wildcats could
easily run through the three games
and lock up the automatic berth in
the NCAA tournament that comes
with winning the championship.
Without that confidence, though,
the Wildcats stay could easily be
much shorter.

After Saturday’s tough loss,
the Wildcats will try to avenge the
earlier loss to the Paladins and
create that confidence and momen-
tum to carry into the weekend.

“If you look at our season,”
McKillop said, “it’s just the subtle
things that have differentiated us
from last year. When we lose, its
just a little thing here, a little thing
there that are making the differ-
ence.”

Last year, of course, the Wild-
cats won 12 of their last 13 regular
season games, swept into the tour-
nament final and came within one
pointof reaching the NCAAs. They
then received an NIT bid, before
losing to West Virginia.

This season, they’ ve stumbled
and staggered toward the end of
the year, with the big January win
over Marshall followed by three
Straight losses, then an exciting
last-second win against Appala-
chian State. A week later, it was
the big win over The Citadel com-
ing just before losses to VMI and
Marshall. We’ve been just a play
or two away all season,” McKillop
said. “We are that close. We’ ve
had some good spurts where we
looked like our old selves... These
are mature guys. I expect them to
respond with confidence.”

senior captains Erik McMichael
and Joe Beach, who ate both dis-
tance runners.

Other team members include
sophomore distance runner Dave
Foss, hurdler Ivar Kiigemagi and
Cookson.

Says Andrew, “We had a lot
of good performances on the men’s
team [this weekend], andI’ mlook-
ing forward to improving during
the outdoor season.”

The women’s squad is led by
junior captain Marie Grisez, also a
distance runner, and is coached by
Beth Manson. The rest of the team

includes freshman distance runner.

sophomore jumper and sprinter
Lara Burkholder, senior distance
runner Carolyn Meadows and
Sims.

Both the men’s and women’s
teams practice six days a week,
and Manson agrees with Andrew
that the hard work is paying off.

In regards to the last
weekend’s results, Manson says,
“The teams ran really well... We
had a lot of personal records. .. The
teams are small, but everyone is
doing a good job and running hard.”

Moses is also very enthusias-
tic about the team’s overall perfor-
mances. She says, "We have a
wonderful team captain who keeps
usallin line, and everyone is work-
ing really hard.”
