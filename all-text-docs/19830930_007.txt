Tom Johnson:

By ALLISON WILLS

Tom Johnson seems like the typical
American — certainly not the circus
type.

But in an attempt to erase painful
Vietnam memories and two sour mar-
riages, the thiry-five year-old native
New Yorker joined the Roberts Brothers
Circus last March because he says, “this
way I don’t have a chance to get attached
to nobody. I’m on the road all the time.”

Johnson is a drifter — the circus busi-
ness’s term for the “regular riff-raff” who
join the show on the road — usually to
escape something or someone.

He and the thirty-five other members
of the Roberts Brothers Circus com-
pleted their six-month tour of the eastern
United States in Davidson Friday night
with two performances each drawing
about 200 spectators.

While humoring a circus infant and

tending the ball toss booth, Johnson
spoke seriously about his escape from
conventional American life. “All in the
world I’m attached to is my dog. In Nam,
there was so much pressure and responsi-
bility, I felt hemmed in, and I never want
to feel that way again.”

Johnson’s duties are far from glamor-
ous — setting up the tent, driving a truck,
and, of course, tending the ball toss
booth. The days are so long, and the

-Miusic
Costello

By STEPHEN MANK

At some point in his career, Elvis
Costello stopped being admired for his
uniqueness and began being respected
for his intelligence. Once the dead
ringer for Buddy Holly on the fringe of
the late 70’s punk movement, Elvis
matured under the spotlight to become
an extraordinary songwriter. His new
album is testament to his improve-
me oe aan

Punch the Clock’ is “a miniature
documentary on rock and roll. Using
bitter-sweet lyrics that ramble play-
fully through every aspect of life and
love, Elvis creates the perfect founda-
tion on which to base his catchy pop
music. Costello takes the listener from
remorse to joy to commentary on
man’s lot in life without missing a
beat.

Costello has all but retired from the
Attractions as a musician, dedicating
himself entirely to his true forte,
lyrics. His are not the lyrics of a musi-
cian who needs words to match the for-
mat. Rather they are rollicking images
that refuse to fall into the rigid confines
of stanzas and choruses. In “The
Greatest Thing” Elvis squeezes two or
three lines into what should be one.

The first song on the album, “Let
Them Talk,” is an all out funk rave-up,
in which horns add a flavor too often
lost in today’s music. Here too is an
example of lyrics that follow no stan-
dards, and more importantly, no
cliches.

Steve Nieve defied all conventions
in his wonderfully unique keyboards
which seem to wander blithely through
such songs as “Everyday I Wnite the
Book,” and “Pills and Soap.”

“Everyday I Write the Book” also
shows how close-knit the group is as a
unit. While other groups such as the
Police or Pink Floyd have become the
devices of single musicians, The At-

tractions each serve very vital and dif-
ferent roles. The independent drums,
bass, and piano integrate harmonically
against the lush backdrop of real
strings.

But The Attractions are not simply
a pop oriented band. On “Shipbuild-
ing” they readily adapt to the blues
genre while Elvis, in his delightfully
flat voice sings of a town whose liveli-

hood depends on building war ships.
The paradox of living off of death (a la
Brecht’s Mother Courage) is an im-
portant one as Costello asks, “Is it
worth it?”

Just as Elvis recalls the blues that
inspired him, he also recalls the punk
that made him. His saccharine-sweet,
light erotica can be seen in “The World
and his Wife,” in which he sings, “The

Jittle girl you dangled on your. Knee. _
‘without “mishap,

stirs “something in
your memory, and something in your
lap.”

This same theme can be found in
“Love Went Mad” in which he wishes
a girlfriend “luck with a capital ‘F’.”

Costello has no pretension of being
a virtuoso on guitar but he does make
occasional cameo appearances on the
album. Every now and then, if you lis-
ten real close you can hear his rhythm
guitar striking tinny chords in the
background. On one song he even
plays a solo.

Bass and drum players Pete and
Bruce Thomas complement each other
rather than mimic, both showing great
technical adeptness on the respective
instruments.

Punch the Clock brings back many
instruments thought to be long gone
from the modern music scene, includ-
ing piano, organ and acoustic guitar.
Most important are Costello’s lyrics,
which on this and preceding albums
have carved him a niche in modern
rock music.

The Life Of A Circus Drifter

nights are spent in cramped quarters.

It seems like an excessive price to pay
for “freedom,” and some drifters find it
too excessive. “We pick up drifters all
the time. Some find the work too hard,
and only stay for a couple of weeks,”
Johnson explained as his cigarette smoke
wafted into the afternoon sun. ‘But lots,
like me, love this life.”

He hopes to stay in the business for
the rest of his life, though he admits there
is no future in the small-scale circus busi-
ness.

With costs in the range of $2500 a
day just to stay in operation, the Roberts
Brothers Circus 1s barely surviving. Its
owner, Bob Earl, is a retired aerial artist
who opened his show ten years ago to re-
main tied to the business.

Today's audience demands more
than a one-elephant show. The goat act
and the pony routine just don’t measure
up to what we have come to expect from
the circus leaving us depressed, rather
than jubilated after the modest perfor-
mance.

While on tour, the circus trucks pull
into a small town on the morning | of the

“show ‘arid’ Spend “aii aay" putting up the

tent and preparing for the performance
that evening. When the crowd scatters
and the last program is sold, the staff
packs everything up, and if there is time,
Johnson says, “our favorite thing to do is
to go to bars and listen to people talk
about us and how weird we are.”

And the next morning, they are on the
road again gearing up for another crowd
of reserved adults and distracted pre-
schoolers.

But circus people hang on. They love
the life and each other. “Some people
call them weird and some people call
them has-beens, but they're like a family
to me,” Johnson said. ‘We take care of
each other.”

No one seems to notice that the bal-
ance artist is past her prime and certainly
too old to be attractive in an elaborate and
daringly scarce costume. And no one
complains when they have to make a
quick change from the glamour of center
ring to vending popcorn in a steamy con-
cession stand over the course of an eve-
ning.
