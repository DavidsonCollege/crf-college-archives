The Davidsonian

...faculty discuss evaluation ‘procedure

(Continued from page 1)

There is a question as to
whether evaluation forms are
the best way to gather student
opinion at all, remarked Zim-
,mermann. ~

During the meeting a news-
paper clipping concerning the
value of student evaluation was
passed around and submitted to
the PAC. The article reports the
results of a study correlating
teacher evaluation with how
much the student learned based
upon testing.

The correlation was highly

negative (-.75) and as the
experiments put it, ‘“‘Students

rate most highly those instruct-.

ors from whom they learned
least.”’

There was a concern voiced
about the role‘of the untenured
faculty in the evaluation proc-
ess and how this is expressed in
the code, said Zimmermann.

“Some junior faculty mem-
bers expressed that the untenu-
red faculty need a more defined
role. Others said the untenured
faculty role should be limited in
some respects.”

Professor of German Hans-
ford Epes pointed out that
although untenured faculty me-
mbers may not be excluded
from the evaluation process,
their input is not specifically
guaranteed by the document.

Professor of Sociology Nor-
man B. Koller noted that while
student input into the evalua-
tion process is defined, that of
junior faculty members is not.
He termed the code ‘‘a very
inhibiting document for unten-
ured faculty.”

“Some faculty members ar-
gued that younger professors
just out of graduate school may
be better acquainted with the
field,”’ said Wolf.

The suggestion that “unten-
ured faculty members may not
be as stale as some faculty who
have been here’a while was also
brought up,”’ he continued.

Wolf cited a faculty question
as ‘‘to what extent it is prying
into a private life if the college
tries to evaluate a _person’s

chairman ought to have is being

ethical and moral values?”

Some professors thought the
code was too idealistic. Zimmer-
mann countered, ‘‘You set down
your ideals and hope that
putting down what you’re striv-
ing for will help the realization
of these goals.”’

Maydole commented, “The
Code talks a lot about the high
morals of the faculty without
any spelling out of what those
high ideals are. I think that’s
dangerous. If they’re going to
talk with that kind of language,
then there ought to be a Bill of
Rights appended to it.”

Maydole continued, ‘‘The
code lays the burden of proof
entirely on the candidate. The-
re’s no statement in it about
how to go about demonstrating
that.”

Zimmermann noted that. the
code deals with intangibles,
which are very difficult to
measure,

Professor of Classics Mark I.
Davies queried, ‘‘How can you
be very precise about ethical
and moral matters?”’ -

“Some members of the facul-
ty expressed a concern that the
code should stick to procedures
and should not go into the
philosophical background of
what teaching is all about,’’
said Zimmermann.

Davies observed, ‘‘As soon as
you come out with a philosophi-
cal statement instead of just a
strict procedural outline dealing
with the evaluation of people, it
is bound to create a good deal of
tension. I think that’s very
healthy, very good.”

Kimmel cited several other
problems with the code. “‘There
are six points for evaluation,”
he said.

“‘There’s no indication of
what relative weights are given

‘to different skills and compete-

ncies.”’

“I’d like to see priorities. I
imagine they'll develop as we go
along,” he added.

Kimmel also expressed con-
cern over the role of department
chairment as outlined in the
document. ‘‘The power the

too closely invested in the Vice .
President for Academic A ffair’s
Office (VPAA) at all levels--hir-
ing, appointment, and tenure,’’
he explained.

“The department chairman
looks more like a paper pusher
than having any major influ-
ence.’

In regards to the document as
a whole, Kimmel stated, ‘‘It’s
nice to have on paper, but it’s
unworkable to have the VPAA
doing the evaluating by him-
self.

“It’s impossible to do. Even
if the VPAA didn’t have any-
thing else to do, he wouldn’t
have enough time for all that’s
spelled out, specifically faculty
evaluation.” he explained.

Zimmermann noted that
some faculty found statements
in evaluation criterion six that
were incongruous. ‘‘They are
grouped together; it’s quite
true,’’ he admitted.

Zimmerman picked an exam-
ple: ‘‘ ‘consideration for oth-
ers’ is followed by ‘building
library resources.’ ’

Other points which required
clarification during the meeting
included ‘physical vigor,’’ ‘‘in-
ternational outlook,” ‘‘support

- of established faculty policies,”

and “‘strict confidentiality.”’
“The prodecure was intended
to be broad. People are looking

_at it specifically, and rightly

” remarked Wolf.

w t's basically a good docu-
ment,’’ asserted Professor of
English Georgianna Zeigler.
“Most of the problems are of
phrasing and interpretation
which need to be worked out.

“The document tends to indi-
cate the distinction Davidson
wants to make; we don’t hire
just for professional standards,
but for a well-rounded person.”’

Kimmel approved the empha-
sis on scholastic events. He also
likes “‘the emphasis on evalua-
tion at all levels with respect to
stimulating faculty developm-
ent before and after tenure.’”’

According to Koller, ‘‘The
basis for faculty tenure and
promotion has been in the past
a hocus-pocus type of thing.
It’s good to institute a proce-
dure. It’s a step forward.”

Ten written statements of
opinion on the code have been
given to the PAC, said Wolf,
‘‘with a promise of more to
come.”’

“When the PAC gets a clear
idea of what the faculty wants,
we can sit down and discuss it,”’
said Zimmermann.

As a result of Tuesday’s
discussion, Zimmermann sees
“some things need revising and
reworking. I haven’t seen any
fundamental changes.”’ he said.

“This is the second draft of
the code,” said Wolf. “I can

promise that there will be a
third and I can contemplate
that there will be a tenth.”

Wolf anticipated that a for-
mal statement of the code will
be completed by the fall.

“It depends on how fast the
faculty procedure moves,’’ exp-
lained Zimmermann. ‘Its best
not to hurry. There’s no real
deadline we face.”

Zimmermann expressed that
“‘at some point it will be
desirable to have student and
community input.”

He projected that there will .
be a joint meeting with the
SGA, the PAC, and himself. No
such meeting is yet scheduled.

“The way people are evaluat-
ed,’’ said Wolf, ‘‘depends in
part on who is sitting in the
chair of the VPAA. We have a
new man in that position and
the code reflects his ideas.

“I think he’s straightforward
and wants to let people know
where he stands without writing
a document so narrow that
there’s no room for diversity.”

Koller commented, ‘‘It’s a
good document in principle,
with a couple of big exceptions,
but the whole thing runs on
faith in the administration.”’

Koller emphasized that ‘‘the
spotlight is on the faculty code
of evaluation. People are watch-
ing. Things are rather tentative
at the moment.”
