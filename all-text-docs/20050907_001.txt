College responds to Hurricane Katrina

Campus relief

efforts underway
By Kate Gillespie
News Editor

The immense damage caused
by Hurricane Katrina has led
Davidson to coordinate relief
efforts over the past week.

The Residence Life and
Community Service Offices are
working together to mobilize the
campus and send supplies and
funds to the Gulf Coast.

Davidson’s involvement in the
relief effort was prompted by a
challenge to local colleges made
by two DJs from Kiss 95.1, a
~ Charlotte-area radio station, who
raised $80,000 and eight full
eighteen-wheeler trailers full of
supplies in two days.

“Together with Belmont
Abbey, Johnson & Wales, and
Queens College, we challenge
our collegiate community to
raise funds and supplies for the
victims of Katrina,” said RLO
program coordinator Quinton
McKissick.

RLO responded to the chal-
lenge by organizing a donation
drive for first aid supplies, bev-
erages by the case, baby formula
and diapers, and batteries.

The drive began last Friday
and will end this Friday.

Each hall on campus, as. well
as F 204 in Martin Court, has a
collecting box in its lounge.

The Community Service
Office and the Red Cross Club
began collecting monetary dona-
tions in the Union yesterday.
Students are also allowed to
make contributions using their
Cat Cards at the Union
Information Desk.

Both RLO and the Community
Service Office hope to get a
strong response from students.

“My initial thought would be
to see 100 percent participation,
since we [Davidson College]
pride ourselves on stating we
have a large percentage of our
student body participating in
setvice,” McQuissick said. “We
are all blessed by either attend-
ing Davidson or by working at
Davidson. Any assistance we can .
offer these people will go a long

College extends admission to students
from New Orleans universities

As the Davidson community col-
lects supplies and money for vic-
tims of Hurricane Katrina, the
Office of Admission and Financial
Aid is reaching out to displaced
students from Tulane and Loyola
University.

Lauren Cunningham ’09 is the
first of these “refugee students” to
arrive on campus. Cunningham,
who is from Atlanta, had started
moving into her Tulane dorm room
on the Friday before Hurricane
Katrina hit. Later that afternoon,

Tulane’s president announced that
Tulane would be closing at 5 p.m.
Cunningham, who was initially
evacuated to Jackson State
University (JSU) in Mississippi,
didn’t realize that Tulane would
not have a fall semester until she
returned home a day later.

“My parents and I frantically

began calling schools,”
Cunningham said. “My high
school counselor also called

schools for me. She called
Davidson on my behalf, and that’s

how I’m here today.”
According to President Bobby
Vagt, there are three types of

For Gulf natives, impact hits home

By KATE GILLESPIE

Hurricane Katrina has destroyed
millions of homes and businesses
and caused an estimated 10,000
deaths in New Orleans alone since
hitting the Gulf Coast as a
Category 4 storm last Monday.

Katrina, one of the most power-
ful hurricanes to hit the northern
Gulf Coast in half.a century, has
irreversibly affected the lives of
Davidson students from Louisiana,
as well as those who have been
haunted by stories and images of
the storm’s devastation.

“People are shooting at helicop-
ters; gangs are rampant in the
streets,” said Walker Saik ’06, who
is from Louisiana. “I’ve heard sto-
ries where people have been
robbed at gunpoint, so even if
water didn’t trap people in their
homes, the fear of getting raped or
murdered has forced people to hide
inside with whatever supplies they
have.”

Saik’s family members, as well
as those of Davidson students
Gretchen Hoffman ’09 and Oscar
Hernandez ’06, were among the
hundreds of thousands of
Louisiana residents who evacuated

before the storm”hit. While some *

whose family lives about an hour

know it’s coming, it’s too late to
get everyone out. That’s the begin-
ning of the worst-case scenario.”

residents were able .to safely
escape, others were trapped in New
Orleans and areas in the direct path
of the hurricane.

Davidson faculty and administrators visit-
ed a coastal village in India this summer that
was devastated by the December 2004 tsuna-
mi and donated two fishing boats purchased
through Davidson’s tsunami relief efforts.

Their visit was part of a three-week faculty
development tour, made possible by a long-
standing partnership between Davidson and
Madras Christian College (MCC); located
outside of Chennai in southern India.

Ten faculty members and two administra-
tors participated in the tour from June 3-28. It
was the third of its kind in India and the first
since 1996.

Job Thomas, director of Davidson’s South
Asian Studies department and an alumnus of
MCC, led the tour, as he has a personal con-
nection to the area.

“My family’s there,” he said, referring to
the city of Chennai, of which Tambaram is a
suburb. His home church is in the city as
well.

December 2004 tsunami, students and facul-
ty at Davidson began raising funds to send to
the devastated region. Davidson students,
who had participated in the 2004 Semester in
India program, raised $1,000 by selling t-
shirts, and the faculty donated close to $5,000
into a special relief fund.

The combined amounts were sent to MCC,
which. bought two fiberglass fishing boats,
complete with motors and fishing nets, for a
small coastal village. The village’s old,

wooden, creaky and barely seaworthy boats §

had been destroyed by the tsunami.
The faculty and staff in India visited the

small village during their trip, and took part Mf
in an emotional boat launching ceremony, ¢

even riding out into the water on the two
bright red boats. The Davidson College logo
was emblazoned on the bow of each boat.

For Thomas, the ceremony stood out as one
of the most memorable in his 25 year
involvement in the program.

“I’m not a sentimental person,’ Thomas
