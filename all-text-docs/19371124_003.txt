John Ranson, Senior:

“I'd rather have

Hal Kemp, myself.
I believe he’s the
best. He's shown
by his radio per-
formances that he
can put on a good
: show with novel-
ties. Then he’s always got the lat-
est thing out in up-to-the-minute
arrangements. Dorsey's my second
choice. I think he really has bet-
ter dance music than Kemp, but

Kemp would put on a better show.”
