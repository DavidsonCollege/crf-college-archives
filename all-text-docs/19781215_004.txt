The current procedure of electing stu-
‘dents to the Hearing Committee tugs
candidates towards. imbecility, insults
voters, and enfeebles the Honor Code it
purports to perpetuate.
~ A troll through the dormitory halis this
week was a depressing experience. “Vote
for Bob,’ ‘he’s no slob”; “We need Jean,
- she’s teal keen.” And for those not drawn
to pithy mottos, there was the time-ho-
nored standby: “Vote for Joe Student,
Freshman for Hearing Committee”. . .
“Vote for Jane Student, Sophomore for-
Hearing. Committee”. “Vote for Jim
Student, ae for Hearing aiwhunees

We. exaggerate, perhaps, but By by
much.

Candidates stick platforms onto the
doors of the johns. One john looks tike
anothef, one platform looks like another.

“The "Honor Code is Davidson's most
precious. institution, a tornerstone of the
unique sense of community we all enjay. |
am an. honest, fair-minded. student. Elect
me to the Hearing Committee and | .will
defend our Honor Code.”.

- Daft slogans are scrawled on poster- :

‘board and pasted on the walls. They fall
and are trampled on. Election day comes,

the vote is cast, some hopetuls win.
Good sense and the Honor Code lose.
Davidson’s most cherished institution
deserves better treatment.

The current selection process is unfair

to the candidates: while popular, well-

known students need only post their

names to win, lesser-knowns, desperately
seeking name identity, must embrace
tacky slogans.

Platform originality: is almost impos-
sible.

The current selection process is unfair
to the voters, who have little substantive
information on which to make an. intelli-
gent decision.

The current selection process is unfair
to the Honor Code itself. .

At a time when. some claim that the

Code is crumbling. away, we hasten. its

' demise by electing its defenders in a

circus-sideshow atmosphere.

__.We ask the Hearing Committee and the
SGA to spare us from Bob:Slob and Keen
Jean and Joe, Jim, and Jane , Student.
Work together to give us a new, more

sensible Hearing Committee selection
"| process.

From the Ear

‘If elected, Iwill...

Last week, I pulled out my
year-old campaign platform and
compared Phil Duncan the can-
didate to Phil Duncan the
editor. I promised to increase
the size of the newspaper’s
staff, and I did. I promised to
affiliate The Davidsonian with
national press organizations
serving college newspapers and
to reintroduce The Davidsonian

into national competition with

other newspapers. I have done

so.

I failed in my pledge to invite
professional journalists to the
campus and in my promise to
solicit student opinions through
polls.

This week, I continue to
compare promise to fact.
CAMPAIGN PROMISE: Bar-
ring mechanical failures, we will
deliver The Davidsonian to the
doorstep of every on-campus
student Thursday night. .. I
will also explore the possibility
of delivering the newspaper to
college-owned off-campus
houses.

A key phrase here is ‘barring
mechanical failures.”” At least
twice this year the cantakerous
compugraphic phototypesetting

and processing equipment mal-
’ functioned before final deadline
time, delaying printing until

Friday. Somewhere in the sha-
dowy part of last spring I seem’

to remember .that:the staff.

simply failed to meet deadlines,

In the past three,.weeks I
have delegated much of. the
production and layout responsi-
bilities to younger, inexperi-
enced staff members in order to
prepare a ‘‘new generation” of
workers for editor-elect: Charles
Erwin. Though delegation to
inexperienced hands has been

partially responsible for recent
distribution delays, training the
“new generation” will improve

_the quality of Erwin’s Davidso-

nian.

Of the 30-some Davidsonian’s
this year, a half-dozen have
been distributed late. I hoped
for better.

CAMPAIGN PROMISE: Dun-
can hopes to persuade students
to send The Davidsonian to

’ parents and friends at other

schools.

An A-plus here. The circula-
tion department has undergone
a major revamping this year as
well as pushing for new sub-
scriptions; we have updated the
inaccurate mailing list which I
inherited from the past.

This week, we. will send out
250 newspapers by mail; that
brings $1,500 in subscription
revenue yearly, quite a figure
considering that our—total- on-
campus distribution is only
1,350.

Restoring the circulation de-
partment is only a part of an
effort this past year to put the
business end of the newspaper
on firm footing. The effort has
been quite successful. The
newspaper is in healthy finan-
cial shape, the business, adver-
tising, and circulation mana-
gers are underclassmen who will
stay on after December and
/provide:.the. continuity. critical
to efficient business manage-
ment.

I said almost nothing about
the business end of the paper in
my campaign promises because
at the time of the election I
know next to nothing about it.
In the past: year I’ve probably
learned and accomplished more
on the management side than in
any other single area of the
newspaper. i
