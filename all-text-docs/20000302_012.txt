DUFF splits tourney games

DUFF, the Davidson. Ultimate Frisbee
Folks, was on the prow] again this past Satur-
day, playing four different teams at the home
on the IMAC fields.

DUFF finished the tournament 2-2.

In the first game of the day, DUFF fell to
Appalachian State by the score of 13-7.

“Appalachian State is always a really
tough team to play,” remarked team co-cap-
tain Coddy Coddington.

Davidson fell again in its second game of
the day, this time to Wake Forest, by a score
of 11-10.

; “We played a really hard, long game
against Wake, and the final score just ended
up going their way,” Coddington said.

DUFF fought back with a vengeance
against UNC-Asheville, winning by a score
of 13-5.

“We definitely got better as the day went
along,” Max DuBuisson commented.

In the final game of the day, Davidson
pounded Guilford 13-2, marking the first
time Wildcats had ever beaten Guilford.

“Our zone defense was unbelievable
against Guilford, and we really came together
as a team,” lauded Coddington. “Our team

skills are improving every day, and this tour-
nament shows our improvement working to-
gether as a team.”

The consensus among team members
was that Saturday’s defense showed marked
improvement since the Furman tournament,
and the team effort appeared to be the decid-
ing factor.

“Everyone played really well as a team,”
added Dave Stroupe. “Everyone was making
good throws and catching all of the passes.”

The tournament on Saturday also drew a
record number of fans for an ultimate frisbee
tournament at Davidson—34.

“The crowd was the reason we played so
well,” Phil Reed remarked. “They energized
us and motivated us to play 100 percent.”

John Lambeth, a spectator at the tourna-
ment, stated, “It was really exciting to watch.
Ultimate frisbee is a growing sport at David-
son, and it really needs more support.”

DUFF’s next tournamentis the St. Patty’s
Ultimate Daze held on March 18-19 in Co-
lumbia, SC.

“We are looking to go down there and
have fun, and hopefully the tournament will
help us improve,” said Coddington. “We will
be playing some really tough club teams and
some tough college teams as well.”

Sophomore Mark Wells picked up two
saves in last week’s three-game series
against Southern Conference foe
Wofford.

WOMEN’S ROUNDUP

Wildcats tennis entered its contest
against the Campbell Camels on atwo-game
tear, and short of an international coalition
force, nothing could stop them.

But for the Camels, who boasted an
internationally diverse roster, that force was
with them as they defeated the Wildcat 6-1
in women’s tennis action last Friday in David-
son. :

Katie Brooks topped the Camels’
Lindsey Hughes 6-2, 6-3 in the only win for
the Wildcats. Forbes Thompson lost to
Swiss Laurence Poujoular 6-3, 6-2. Eliza-
beth Moreno lost to Austrian Katrin Gaber
6-3, 6-0. Number three singles player
Yasmine Hilu was defeated 6-1, 6-1 by

lost to another Austrian, Kerstin Stockinger
6-2, 7-6, 6-4. Another Swiss, Alexia Erb,
defeated lone senior Anna Holland 6-2, 6-4.

In doubles contests, only one of the
three matches was contested with Erb and
Poujoular defeating the Wildcats’ team of
Hilu and Holland 6-2, 6-3.

‘Davidson won both uncontested
matches, but the two victories did not count
against the final score.

Campbell tennis visits Davidson

MEN’S ROUDUP

This past Saturday, the men’s tennis
team fell to the visiting Camels of Campbell
College, 5-2.

The match began favorably for the

| Wildcats with the No. 1 doubles team of

Bret Ialacci and Alex Okulski downing the

| Camels 8-4.

“Brett and Alex looked like a confident
and aggressive team today, they came out
ready to play,” coach Jeff Frank said.

The Wildcats’ No. 2 and No. 3 doubles
teams, however, couldn’t tame the Camels.

Whit Hansen rebounded from his
doubles loss and recorded the first singles

“win for the Wildcats, defeating Swede

Inglebert Haselhoff 6-2, 6-1.

Billy Boykin claimed the only other
singles victory for Davidson, using his speed
and accuracy to win in three sets, 4-6, 6-2, 6-
0.

A roller coaster match for Chad Philips
saw him dominate the first set 6-0 but then
drop the second 0-6. Philip’s played a fierce
third set but fell 5-7.

“The pieces of the mighty jigsaw puzzle
are on the table, but right now we/can’t put
them together,” added Frank.
