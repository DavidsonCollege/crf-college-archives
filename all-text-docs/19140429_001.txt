THE NEW ADMINISTRATION.

The Presidency of the Student Body
is a responsibility as well as an honor.
n questions of serious consequence his
opinion and his standing are a.tremend-
ous factor. At all times. whether pre-
siding over the Student Council or the
Student Body. he needs tact. firmness
eaand strength. The students of David-
son College have chosen to put their
faith in Mr. Scarborough for the coming
vear. He is a.man who will guard
faithfully the principles of honor for
which the college stands. The students
awe to him and to his associate Vice-
Presidents earnest and hearty support
in evervthine which will enlarge the
efficiency and influence of. Davidson.
To the new Administration, Greeting!

HOME TALENT. °*

°
t

A wonderful drawing card are the
two words “Home Talent.” Citizens
are with honor in their own country
when it comes to displaying publicly
their powers and genius. And the school-
hovs and ¢irls of a town are a big at-
traction alwavs. The play acted by
the students of the High School last
Saturdav night, with 'the aid of a few
college students and one or two teach-
ers, was a credit to the school and to
all who took part. Such enthusiasm.
skill and ease on the stage of life will
make the town proud of her sons and
daughters, some day.

TENNIS.

Tennis has falwavs been one of the
most popular sports at Davidson. <A
racket and a pair of tennis balls is with-
in the scope of every man’s pocketbook,
and aset can he plaved when other rec-
reati re crowded out. But the op-
porttin for good tennis could be
much inibroved and increased by better
organization.

There are still two or three court
spaces available on the new grounds. A
few afternoons’ work would put them
in good shane and imorove greatly the
apnearance of this place.

With verv little expense to each, the
owners of the various courts could em-
plov a man to keen them marked and in
good condition. Better and more tennis
would result. Why not have more than
one championship court?

“A class tennis tournament at a season
when other athletics are not in the fore-
ground would stimulate as much inter-
est as class base hall or foot ball. There
is no use in having an apology for ten-
nis at Davidson.

JUST WORDS.

The weekly composition is the dread
of manv an English student, especially in
the lower classes of a college. When the
subject assigned seems a little difficult.
one is apt to think that the good derived

. from such work is not worth the time re-
quired. True, composition is just the
putting together of words; but how
much depends on the right choice and
Correct arrangement of these words!
After the thought has been correctly ex-

-| gested :

Carrier of news and knowledge,

Instrument of trade and industry,

Promoter of mutual acquaintance,
of peace and aoad will

Among men and Nations.

For the west entrance Dr. Eliot sug-
Carrier of love and svmpathy,
Messenger of friendship,

Consoler of the lonely,
Bond of the scattered family,
Enlarger of the public life.

President Wilson’s revision is:
Messenger of sympathy and love,
Servant of parted friends,

Consoler of the lonely

Bond of the scattered family.

Enlarger of the common life.

The thought is virtually the same in
both cases, but note how «much more

suggestive, concrete, and rvthmical is the fe

President's. expression.

Such choice and arrangement of
words as President Wilson's is indeed a
gift. But constant practice will do
much towards improving any stvle; and
even the greatest genius in the world

would amount to nothing without work.

WILL DAVIDSON COME TO
THIS?

An old Scottish gentleman who was
a great enthusiast. on the golf links, ang
a young man who was equally enthusias-
tic about the game, had spent the entire
dav in the field, and had had some re-
markably close and exciting games.

As they left for home the old man
remarked, while his rugged face lighted
up with a pleasant smile:

“Hey, Mon, but it's been a gran’
day!” ue
“It has,” assented the young man.

“Think Ye could come again on the
morrow, laddie ?”

“Well,” answered the young man re-
flectively, “I was to be married, but I
can put it. off.”—Lippincott’s.

TO THE VICTOR BELONGS
THE PIE, UNLESS—

About a week ago quite a fracas took
place at Georgia Tech and all because
of one small piece of blackberry pie.
During dinner, when the waiter was
serving the dessert, he happened ‘to leave
an extra_piece of pie on the freshmen’s
table. Claims were immediately put in
by two freshmen. and it was finally
agreed that they should adjourn to the
campus and decide by the manly art of
fisticuff who should take the pie unto
himself. And so they were having the
fight of their lives when the sad news
was borne to them that one of their
number, a second Judas; had masticated
that pie with the greatest calmness and

delectation. The fight was called off. EOCooooooooo‘oooo‘oCoCOCeSL
