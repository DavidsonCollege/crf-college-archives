W. P. PARKER GIVES INTER-
ESTING ACCOUNT OF WORK

The Davidson student body is the re-
cipient of a number of interesting letters
from W. P. Parker, '12, who is sup-
ported in the foreign mission service by
the student body. These letters give a
charming account of his visits and his
work. Mr. and Mrs. Parker are located
at Mokpo, Korea, where they are en-
gaged in educational and industrial
work.

He expressed a wish that he could be
back and mingle with the Davidson fel-
lows once again. He writes most inter-
estingly of his visit to China last sum-
mer, where he enjoyed talking with
Frank W. Price, ’15, concerning his
Alma Mater.

He says that they have few horses in
Korea compared with the large number
in China. He gives a unique descrip-
tion of the Chinese wheelbarrow as “the
great - wheeled, _everlastingly - creaky,
unweildy vehicles, pushed by one man
with a strap over his shoulder, loaded
with from one thousand to fifteen hun-
dred pounds.” With the many interest-
ing narratives of this trip he has related
some of his difficulties in getting his
money exchanged, and says, “If any of
you have any tears to spare, shed them
for the China missionaries who have to
use this money every day.” He gives a
good status of the currency system of
those neighbor nationalities. At Chefoo
he visited the China Inland Mission
School for English Children. There the
students from six years through the high-
er classes take fourteen subjects at one
time until seventeen, when they take the
Oxford entrance examination.

His visit to Port Arthur was an im-
pressive one; and a young Japanese lieu-
tenant manifested much hospitality.

Mr. Parker has a school of about
ninety boys. “To his more advanced
classes he teaches Algebra, Bible, and
English. Mathematics. is difficult for
the Koreans, and it is amusing to hear
the English class grapple with complex
English sounds. The English accents
are dificult as compared with those of
the Korean vernacular. Mrs. Parker is
teaching the girls to plav the organ and
also has charge of the industrial work,
as well as being director of the boys’
singing. An entertainment was held for
the students at the close of the school
term at Christmas. The thing which
seemed most wonderful to the natives
was the burning of wire in oxygen. Mr.
Parker is superintendent of Sunday
schools for heathen children.

At the annual meeting for discussion
of mission problems, it was decided that
Mr. and Mrs. Parker would, in the near
future, go to Pyengyang, where Mr.
Parker will be connected with college
work.

DR. RICHARDS PRESENTS
PRESBYTERIAN DOCTRINES

On Thursday night at the Y. M. C.
A. meeting Dr. C. M. Richards inter-
ested a large audience by his instructive
presentation of the fundamental doc-
trines of the Presbyterian Church. The
Scripture reading was from the eighth
of Romans,

The doctrine which distinguished the
Presbyterian Church from others is the
belief that the church should be govern-
ed by the ruling and teaching elders. All
of its doctrines are included in the
“Westminster Standard,” which con-
sists of the “Confession of Faith,” the
“Larger Catechism,” and the ‘Shorter
Catechism.” The Presbyterian Church
was founded upon the logical arrange-
ment of the underlying Bible teachings
which was worked out by Calvin. In
this arrangement Calvin placed first the
sovereignty of God, out of which crew
the belief in Predestination and Provi-
dence. Dr. Richards said that the church

The DAVIDSONIAN, March 15, 1916

has not been able to reconcile these with
the fact that God did not cause sin to
come into the world, but that the Pres-
byterians were waiting for the day when
all would be made known.

Dr. Richards next mentioned and ex-
plained the five chief points of Calvin-
ism: First, Total Depravity, which re-
fers to man’s complete inability to know
and serve God because of the sin which
has taken hold of his whole being; sec-
ond, Unconditional Election, which
means that from eternity God determin-
ed to save some of His people, probably
a definite number, to everlasting life, and
these are unconditionally elected; third.
Limited Redemption, that is, although
Christ’s sacrifice was suffcient to save all,
yet redemption is limited to the elect;
fourth, Irresistable Grace, which is the
regenerating influence of the Holy
Spirit; and lastly, Perseverance of the
Saints, which assures the Presbyterians
that a man, elected and regenerated.
even though a sinner, is sure to be saved.

Two results of belief in these doc-
trines which Dr. Richards mentioned
were that man would humble himself
before God, and be fearless and_perse-
vering in serving Him.

WITH OTHER COLLEGES.

From Wisconsin—One of the larges’
and best edited papers coming to the ex
change desk of THe Davinsontian is
“The Lawrentian,” of Lawrence Col-
lege, Appleton, Wisconsin. “lhe paper
claims to be “America’s Greatest Col-
lege Weekly,” coming out each week
with sixteen or twenty pages of live
news. Considering only those which
come to our exchange desk, its claim is
undisputed.

Co-Ordination Wins—By a vote of
19 to 17 the Virginia Senate last Satur-
day passed a bill for the establishment
of a co-ordinate college for women at the
University of Virginia. Much enthus-
iasm was shown in the Senate chamber
when the result df the vote on the co-
ordination bill was announced. The
students at the University of Virginia
have, almost to a unit, opposed it.

University of Louisiana — In the
1916 basket ball season the Louisiana
State University basket ball team won
thirteen out of the twenty-four games,
more than §0 per cent of all played.
‘They scored a total of 691 points against
their opponents’ 600.

A Prize Offered—A loving cup has
heen offered to that student of the Geor-
gia School of Technology who will write
a good original song for his Alma Mater.
Herc is the kind of song that they want:
“A song with dignity; one that sets forth
the ideals of real men: one that any man
at any time or place will not only not be
ashamed of but will be proud to sing and
have sung as the song of his Alma

Mater.” The cartoons of the Georgia
Tech weekly, “The Technique,” are
good.

Wake Fotest-—A new paper on our
exchange list is “The Old Gold and
Black,” the new weekly of Wake Forest.
Tt is a well edited paper, though its gen-
eral appearance differs from that of most
college papers. Concerning Wake For-
est’s Thanksgiving game of foot ball
“The Old Gold and “Black” - says:
“Wake Forest’s Thanksgiving game will
in all probabilitv be plaved in Norfolk.
Va. Manager Carlyle is in communica-
tion with several elevens just now, but
states that Roanoke is liable to sign up a
five year’s contract for the game in Nor-
folk, A. & M. and Washington and
Lee have seemingly deserted Norfolk for
Raleigh, and the Baptist-Lutheran game
ought to be a paying proposition this

all.
