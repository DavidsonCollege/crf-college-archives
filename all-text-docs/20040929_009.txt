DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

parking garage ™

This year, more Davidson students
have registered vehicles on campus than
ever before. With the increased number
of cars on campus has come a corre-
sponding requirement for places to park
those cars. The answer to their needs:
Little Dormitory.

In response to numerous student
complaints, the administration formed a
Parking Committee consisting of six
members of the faculty, the SGA presi-
dent, and the College President.

After deliberations with various stu-
dent leaders, the Parking Committee
presented their recommendations to the
board of Trustees, and their plan was
quickly approved. Their choice of loca-
tion, however, has brought with it some
controversy; the proposed location for
the new parking garage is on the site
where the E.H. Little Dormitory is cur-
rently located.

While most of the outside of Little will
look the same, the wall facing the Watts
Dormitory will be opened up, and the
entire interior will be gutted in order to
create a three story parking structure
which the administration says should
hold seventy-five vehicles. Parking will

also be permitted on the ai

roof. Furthermore, in order
to compensate for the loss
of campus housing caused
by the loss of Little Dormi-
tory, the Preyer building
will be converted into
freshmen substance-free
housing. .

The college is hoping to
begin work as soon as pos-
sible and claim that neither
inhabitants of Little nor
faculty who have offices in
Preyer should be bothered
by the construction. They
plan to have Preyer open to
house students by the be-
ginning of the 2005-2006
school year and expect that the Little dormi-
tory structure will be ready for parking by
November of 2005. ,

SGA president Mark Wilson ’05 believes
this move will be tremendously beneficial.
“Parking has been a major issue for the stu-
dent body for a while now, and it’s great to
finally be able to begin to fix that problem,”
stated Mark. “The new parking garage, ten-
tatively titled ‘the Belk Satellite E.H. Little

that the school has been invaded by
Yankees. Especially them liberal ones.
When I was here, you can bet your rear
that we didn’t have no Young Demo-
crats club on campus. Back in the day, if
you even mentioned FDR, you would
get rocks thrown at you. We didn’t have
no New Yorkers neither. We could
schedule homecoming games whenever
we damn well pleased. In fact, we used
to schedule homecoming on Yom Kip-
pur on purpose. That’s how you knew
when homecoming was. We had stuff in
the honor code about them. That’s an-
other thing. The honor code has gone
completely soft. All those old provisions
are gone. Now I can’t even tell if it’s the
honor code or the pansy code. Heck, it
was against the honor code to use ball-
point pens. Now you're allowed to use
those dang-blasted computers even.
Back in the day, we didn’t have any
stinking Belk Computer Lab. We just
had a room full of typewriters, not even
nice ones. We called it the “typin’ and
smoke room.” It was so full of cigar
smoke you could barely see what you
were typing. But it didn’t matter so
much, because back then the school was
a lot harder. We didn’t have no 24 hour
library room, cause back then, we were
so tired from our marching drills that we
couldn’t stay up past ten o’clock. Even if
we could get some extra energy, it didn’t
matter nothing, cause there were none
of these electric lights in the dorms. In
our dorms we had to sleep on cots. No

mattresses neither, just wooden boards-

on cots. I saw that these kids get real
beds with springs. Yet, these ungrateful
youngsters still yappity- -yap about every
dang,thing. I heard somebody complain-

ing that the laundry ruined their clothes.
In my day, they washed the clothes in
the river. They complain about the
cable? The only entertainment we had
was when we would make freshmen per-
form vaudeville shows. Bats in the
dorms? We had bats flying around our
rooms. One night, I couldn’t even get

onto my cot, cause there were all those
doggone bats nesting on the board. With all
that stuff goin on, we didn’t worry ‘bout re-
views or papers nearly as much as the
poindexters that go here now. Heck, our ap-
plication didn’t have no essay, which was
dang good, because part of the test back then
required you to fight in 2 years in a World
War. Speakin’ of fight. Our football team
had it. We beat the Bulldogs. No not Butler,
darn it. Georgia. And we always wore suits
to the games, especially if we brought ladies.
Ladies. That’s the one area the school is bet-
ter in now. I saw the girls in their sun-
dresses last weekend, and let me tell you,
they were lookin’ mighty pretty. In fact, we

“If you even

you”

didn’t even have girls here. I didn’t even see
a girl for the first three years I was here. I
went and ate at that newfangled Commons
and heard some youngsters complaining in
line about the food. So I pretended to trip
and smacked them across the back of the
knee with my cane. I hate hearin’ complain-
ing about the food. All we had was salted
pork and crackers at the commons. For
drink, we had whiskey. None of those fancy
fruits or vegetables, at least not till my fresh-
man roommate came down with scurvy. We
didn’t have none of this foreigner food like
quesadillas. Next thing you know, this place
is gonna be Vassar. If that’s what you want,
be my guest, but I ain’t never coming back
for homecoming unless there’s more pretty
girls next time.

Garage’ will be in a great location. Its lo-
cation next to the Watts Dormitory will
make it the closest parking option to
Chambers.”

Hector Trimble, Dean of Students and
head of the Parking Committee explained
the committee’s rationale for their deci-
sion: “Students have been complaining
about the sizable distance between Satel-
lite parking and the rest of campus. Some
people also blame the break-ins that oc-
cur in Satellite parking on its remote loca-
tion. This new parking garage should
provide for a significant decrease in a
student’s average walking distance per
day as well as more security, since its lo-
cation is on Dormitory Row, Plus, we are
going to put video cameras all over the
place.”

Some see the biggest benefit of the plan

Little Dormitory to be converted into

as the conversion of the
Preyer building, located
across Concord Road, into
freshmen substance free
housing.

The plan is said to pro-
vide those who choose to
live in substance free
housing with more quiet
hours, and an even more
isolated dormitory. “It
will be much easier for the
inhabitants of the dorm to
have the quiet college ex-
perience they need, if they
are further away from all
the loud happenings of the
rest of campus,” said
Trimble.

“It is a win-win situa-
tion. We get a new park-
ing lot closer to campus
and the sub-free freshmen
will have a more ideal dorm. And we
could sell the names of the new dorm and
parking lot to help defray the construction
costs.”

Others, however, are against the idea of
a new parking lot. Said George Michan
’08, “I came to Davidson for the small
classes, great professors, honor code, and
its beautiful oak filled campus. I didn’t
come for convenient parking. What’s
next, parking on Chambers Lawn?”

Environmental Action Committee
president Burt Edwards ’05 claimed, “If
we keep accommodating for more cars,
we'll keep getting more and more cars on
campus. It’s a never-ending cycle. Soon
we'll have to tear down the cross-country
trails or even Alumni Stadium to make
more parking lots. Eventually, the whole
campus will be one big parking lot.”
