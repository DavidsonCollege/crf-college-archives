10 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Please don’t ignore the risk

By Juvia PHitpotr

According to the American Cancer society
175,000 women will be diagnosed with breast
cancer this year and about 43,300 of those women
will die from the disease. October is breast
cancer awareness month; therefore the health
center is preaching the facts about breast cancer
so that women on this campus can know the risk
factors for the disease and how to detect it.

Many young women are not concerned with
breast cancer because they think it is a disease
that develops in older women, While the risk for
breast cancer does increase with age, young
women are definitely susceptible as well. The
biggest risk factor for breast cancer is being a
woman. With that in mind, do you know your
breasts well enough to detect a change if a small
lump were beginning to form? Early detection is
crucial in diagnosing breast cancer because if it
goes undetected the survival rate decreases dra-
matically.

In order to detect any changes in your breasts
monthly self examinations are necessary. By
examining your breasts regularly, you will know
how your breasts normally feel. The American
Cancer Society suggests checking your breast
about one week after your period; if you have
irregular periods make sure you check your breasts
at the same time every month. Symptoms of
breast cancer can include any lump, thickness,
swelling, dimpling, skin irritation, distortion,
retraction of the nipple, discharge from the nipple,
blood from the nipple, or pain. If you do not
know the proper way to give yourself a breast

exam there are pamphlets at the health center to
guide you through it. Again, checking your breasts
monthly is crucial so that you can notify your
doctor if any changes occur.

While all women are at risk for breast cancer,
some women are at more risk than others. Some
risk factors to be aware of include: a family history
of breast cancer, Obesity (weight more than 20%
above ideal weight), long menstrual history (peri-
ods that start early and end late in life), and con-
suming large amounts of alcohol. Women who
consume large amounts of alcohol daily increase
their changes of developing invasive breast cancer
by 30-40%.

Once a woman turns twenty, she should begin
having mammograms every three years. Every
woman on this campus should at least be thinking
about scheduling amammogram. One out of nine
women is diagnosed with breast cancer each year.
With that in mind I ask you to recall the statistics
presented at the beginning of this article. Think of
all the amazing women who die from this disease
each year. Next, ask you to think about all of your
female friends on this campus, and then think of
yourself. Life is such a gift and it seems a crime to
ignore anything that could help to prolong it.
According to the statistics, someone you know will
be diagnosed with breast cancer. Please do every-
thing you can to take care of your body and give
yourself a monthly breast examination check.
