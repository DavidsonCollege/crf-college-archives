Thi cagers seize A-league,
IMAC basketball “raggy”’

By the
THREE FAIRIES

Quoth Mun Dane, head-
honcho-theory maker: ‘‘This is
my theory, which is mine.
Ahem! IMAC basketball is
somewhat raggy in the begin-
ning, very raggy in the middle
and outrageously raggy at the
end.’’ Mun Dane has -proven
once more his sagacity in such
matters of prognostication.

Two of IMAC’s premiere
tampon teams, the I Felta
Thi’s, led by Chief Ragger
Mike Russ, and the Kerwood
Derbies, captained by three-
time all-American Jeff Heslop,
clashed in the friendly confines
of Johnston Gym for the
A-league title.

To reach the finals against
the unbeaten Thi’s, the Der-
bies emerged from the losers’
bracket by defeating the
stylish SAE’s, the Kathryn
Bridges-led Phi Phenomenon,
and out of de Ghetto, onto de
court, Maybe Tomorrow.

In Game One, the Derbies
were not receiving the usual
help from Ragman Russ when
Mark ‘Eddie. Haskell” Firth
came through with a clutch
technical, boosting the Der-
bies to a 30:24 halftime lead.

Ken Schmader’s attempt at
a flying sit-spin over Cliff
Knechtle’s back received only
a 5.2 from the Russian judge
and Ken was eliminated from
the competition early in the
second half.

Behind assist-men Knechtle
and Al Duncan, the Derbies
coasted to a 67-58 victory.
However in Game Two, after
hours of consultation with
Dean Smith and Phil Ford,
which forced postponement of
the game for four days, the
Thi’s reverted to everybody’s
favorite offense, the four cor-
ners, and took the title by
47-39.

The Thi’s were spurred by

Mitch Kupchak look-alike,
Kirk Combe’s 19 points. Jim
Stephenson was the unani-
mous choice for MVP, silence-
ing the critics who left him off
the regular season all-league
team.

The B-league finals featured
a return to the long-lost days
of fraternitydom, pitting per-
verse PIKA #1 ‘against the
well-groomed gentlemen of
SAE #2.

The SAE’s, coming from
the loser’s bracket, were a
team of A-league caliber had
they been willing to break a
sweat and stop worrying with
their hair.

In Game One, behind
smiling Susan Baynard’s cries
of ‘“‘“Go EEEEEE’s!”’ and
Randy Hunter’s ten big ones
(all he’s got), the fashionable
ones romped to a 47-36 vic-
tory. Several Queenies were
attracted by the prospect of
the climactic rubber game of
the match.

Alas, the ladies were denied
satisfaction, as the PIKA’a
penetrated the SAE’s flimsy
defenses for the title, winning
46-40.

At a post-game press con-
ference, nurd Rob Canning,
without foundation, credited
the PIKA victory to the
coaching abilities of Ragman
“Bobby Knight’’ Russ.

Leading PIKA scorer Bill
Tucker sampled the thrills of
victory and had little com-
ment. The SAE’s may have
lost the game, but gee, Bones,
“They sure have great tans!”’

This week’s so-ironic-it-
hurts high light was undoubt-
edly the Davidson Alumni
Association (Coaching Divi-
sion) Reunion at the ACC
tournament. We were so
happy when Terry took his
pregnant wife to Charlottes-
ville. Also, look for Williams
College to send their head

coach to the ACC coaching
ranks next year.

We fully expect a multitude
of letters in protest of the lack
of coverage of the girls’ IMAC
tournament. So this we can
only say ‘“‘Tough nookies, ugh,
we mean tough cookies.’”’ And
in conclusion, this week’s con-
test is, ‘‘who is David Kirk-
man?”’ Send all suggestions to
Box 1296, Davidson, North
Carolina. The first person to
identify this legendary per-
sonality will win an all expense
paid weekend for two to
Elmhurst, Illinois.

The Davidson golf team
began their season by compet-
ing in a tournament held at
Raintree Golf Club in Char-
lotte under Coach Tom Scott.

A strong UNC team woh the
tournament, while Davidson
finished eighth out of a field of
16 teams.

Four of Davidson’s compet-
ing golfers were freshmen,
which, according to Scott, is a
true representation of the
possibilities that exist for the
future Davidson teams., —

Low man for the team was
Sollie Foy, a freshman, with
two 76’s, giving him a total for
the tournament of 152. Jim
Heard, also a freshman,
scored a total of 155, with a 73
and an 82, placing second for
the team.

George Wilson, a senior,
scored 163, while Joe Davis
and Mike Kennedy - both
scored 172. Randy Hunter had
a score of 178.

have a good future ahead of

Freshmen golfers lead team

us, but for this season we’re
going to get better and try to
do as well as we can,”’ said
Scott. “‘I look forward to great
improvement.”

The remainder of the golf
team’s season consists of a
match with Catawba, the
Furman Invitational, and
matches with Hampden-

Sydney, Appalachian State,
Lander, and the Southern
Conference Tournament.

‘‘We will add a seventh and
eighth man for the remainder
of the season, Gilbert Cuth-
bertson and Mike Lanio,”’ said
Scott. ‘““We’re just anxious to
watch the improvement and
win the rest of our matches.”
