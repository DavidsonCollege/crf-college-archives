received the Fetzer award
for excellence in track.

Among other accomplish-

Cats Hold Lead
As Season Ends

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor
Ih spite of threats and
rumors predicting their
downfall, the "Cats have kept
the number one position in
the Southern Conference.

The ‘Cats fill the top spot
with an 8-1 conference re-
cord.

Conference action tomor-
row night will determine the
remaining seedings.

East Carolina and The Ci-
tadel will meet in Greenville
to fight for third place.

William and Maty will
tackle Richmond to preserve
their second rank.

The ‘Cats will greatly be-
nefit from their number one
ranking in the - conference
tournament in Charlotte next

‘Pit —

rematch last Saturday.
The ‘Cats expect a rough-
er contest tomorrow after-

noon.
Bo. Brickels, assistant
coach for the ‘Cats, called

Cincinati: a team equal in
strength to Wake Forest or
St. Johns,

Brickels said that the
Bearcats have a great
amount of potential, © but

have suffered all yéar from
disunity,

“We will have.the advan-
tage,” he said. ‘‘We've just
won three in a row, we're up
for the tournament, and
we're playing at home,
while they have little in
centive.”’

Brickels said that the
Bearcats played a very. phy
sical game, and that several
of their players were among
the best he has observed.

week,

They will receive a pit in
the first round Thursday
night and face the winner of
the fourth and fifth seeded
teams on Friday.

Opinions’ on the  tourna-
ment. vary throughout the
conference.

Coach Terry ‘Holland for
the Wildcats feels confident
that Davidson will make a
clean sweep of the tourna-
ment. :

‘But this position is not
shared by either Coach Dick
Campbell from The Citadel
or Coach Mike Schuler from
V.M.I.

Campbell said that the
conference this “year has
been fairly evenly matched,
and pointed to the home-
court victories most teams
have racked up.

Schuler said--that he; felt
there are-*'six téams in the
conference capable of beat-
ing Davidson."

The winner of the con-
ference championship — will
receive an automatic berth
in-the NCAA regionals, and
the opinion of the coaches
was divided as to the capa:
bility of conference teams to
compete nationally. —

‘Both Campbell and Schuler
stated that they felt that no
team in the conference would
last ih national competition.

Holland held a_ different
view ;

“Davidson can give any
team in the country a good
run for their money,’ he
said.

Holland pointed to the tight
matches the ‘Cats have given
St. Johns, Wake Forest,
Duke and South Carolina’

“We might not beat
them,’’ he said, “but we
won't give them any easy
win either.”
