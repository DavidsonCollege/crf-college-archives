THE DAVIDSONIAN

From Farewell, when I couldn’t make it).

Last winter, my B-
league intramural basket-
ball team did not win when I showed to play.
In the first round of the playoffs, we trailed
20-1 at halftime, but went on a 20-2 run
while I sat on the sideline. I came back into
the game in the final minute, and we missed
the game-winning shot. The only thing that I
could barely claim as victory came this year
in open-league flickerball when our oppo-
nent didn’t have enough people to field a
team.

In the last four years, I have traveled with
the men’s basketball team around the eastern
seaboard. I have watched the team win close
games, lose close games and evolve into the
high-powered program that we all know and
love today.

However, the best part about these tnps
wasn’t just the games; it was the experience
and the stories. After Davidson lost in the
semifinals of the Southern Conference tour-
nament in 2005, I joined six random
Davidson students in a barbeque spot in
downtown Chattanooga and drowned my
sorrow with soda. (We were all underage at
the time.)

The next year, I drove Jackie Pitzer and
Joseph B. Adams through the farms of Ohio
en route to the site of Davidson’s. NCAA
tournament game. I still don’t _Teally know

how Davidson’s mail lady, the head ‘of the
College Republicans and the sports editor all
ended up in the same car.

Immediately after crossing the state’s bor-
der, a cop appeared and flagged us down for
speeding. Right when it seemed that we
would get off with a warning, I mentioned
that we were going to cheer for Davidson in
the NCAA tournament. He looked up and
tersely said, “Ohio State is going to kill you
guys. Here’s a ticket.”

I have watched Davidson football tie an
NCAA record with three safeties in a game.
I have watched the men’s soccer team force
a tie with under five seconds remaining in a
game. I have watched the women’s soccer
team knock off the SEC in one weekend. I
have watched the women’s basketball team
advance to the postseason for the first time
ever, and I’ve seen more game-winning shots
from the men’s basketball team than I can
count on my hands. I have sat next to
Michael Wilbon at the NCAA Tournament
and told him where Davidson is. I have asked
Tyler Hansbrough whether Davidson stu-
dents had anything to do with him not scor-
ing a field goal in the second half of the Nov.
14 game.

Most importantly, I have been able to
spend the last four years with some great
friends getting to do what I love.

Thank you.

2ad to five points at 65-60, Davidson man-
ged to stop UCLA on four consecutive pos-
ssions, but the team could not put points.

SoCon At a Glance

Elon became the SoCon’s first team to lose to a
non-Division-I school this semester. The Phoenix lost
by 14 to Tusculum College. In its defense, Elon was
without several key players who were suspended for
the game.

Many people thought that UNC-Greensboro would
win the SoCon North Division, and their early win
over Georgia Tech reaffirmed that. But the Spartans

lost to lowly Wofford on Saturday. They are now third
in the division.

Davidson usually schedules Division III teams dur-
ing their exam period. This year the team will play
The Citadel.
