wuessed and out-classed the University
of North Carolina in every department
of the annual football game at Winston-
Salem Saturday, but the final score was
10-6 with Davidson at the wrong end.
‘The above tigures give some idea of the
game. but one had to see that game in
order to give justice to whom justice is
due.

lf ever a team really deserved a vic-
tory, it was that same little well-coached,
fighting team which has represented Dav-
idson College with such untold credit to
themselves and to their college. in the
1916 footba:t season. Back in the old
days there may have been Davidson
teams that were stronger, but it is hardly
conceivable that any of her teams could
have shown more fighting heart. or stood
up under such extraordinary breaks of
fortune without faltering or wavering,
than did those fifteen, wearing the fight
ing red, who represented Davidson on
Saturday.

“This team @as out weighed 10 pounds
or more to the man. and. besides their
opponents were men who had had much

RREAKS OF THE GAME

It can be’ said with justice that it has
been always characteristic of Davidson
men to admit defeat -at the hands of a
worthy rival and not to make excuses for
that defeat. The best team, however,

Returns of Election
Received By Students

Enthusiastic Meeting Is Held In
Shearer Rall.

Few “Pep” meetings before a hig
football game have ever been as enthus
iastic as was the meeting which was held
in Shearer. Halt on “Tuesday night to
Kel the returns from the National elec-
tion, “The managers ot the local pigture
show consented to transfer their show to
the hall tor the night and in addition to
the regular reels which they had sched-
uled, Dr. J. W. MeConnell very kindly
loaned some films showing the Celebra-
Gor in Charlette on May 26th, and alse
some scenes at Camp Glenn, the State
mobilization camp,

In addition, the Orchestra played i
mumber of selections thruout the meet-
ing. “Phe messages giving the retiuros

were received by means at a telephone in
stalled in the hall and they were taken
down and announced to the waiting
crowd of students and townspeople who
tilled the hall just as fast as they came
in, “Vhe time between bulletins was in-
terspersed with vells, songs, movies, and
niusic, allof which kept the audience en
thusiastic until che message was received
that Highes avas in the lead bv cight
electoral votes, and that additional infor-
mation wold not be available toy some
hours, “This message came at f230 0p.
m.. ose the meeting was adjourned to
wwalt further returns in the morning,
and it wits not until Shorsday might
that the election of Wilson was definite
hh announced, and then it was that the
students started ont te celebrate the re-
elecion of an old Davidson student, The
thanks of the student body are due to
Messrs. “Vorrence and Blac, the man
agers of the local movie show, tor their
service, tea the telephone company for
the installation of a ‘phone, to the Or
chestra for the music rendered, and to
S. ‘TP. Henderson, W. HE Neal and ‘TV.
J. Mitchell for their efforts in arranging
the meeting and plans for getting the

returns, as well as for the manner in
which they handled them as they came
in.

OUR NEXT GAME.

If the contract is closed. the prospects
for an interesting game with Wofford
are good, “The game will) furnish a
welcome break in the open schedule be-
tween November rtth and November
zoth, and will give the Red and Black
machine another chance for a victory
before its final fight against Clemson

Thanksgiving. Altho the Wofford
team lost to Citadel, they put up a
steady resistance, and were beaten only
by forward passes. Citadel's forward
passing, it will be remembered, was
largely responsible for their scoring on
D.C. ‘The Charleston papers gave
Wofford credit for putting up a hard
game and fight. “The Wofford team has
had rather an unfortunate season. They
have. lost five and won one game up un

til November ot. According to com-
parative scores, the Wofford game
should result in) a comparatively cass

victory for the fighting Red and Black.
but all who attend may be prepared to
see a steadily played game in which Dav-
idson will have to play real football to
score their fourth victory.
