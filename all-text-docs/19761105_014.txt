PDT 3 in tromp over SPES

BODACIOUS. TA-TA’S

Roundballers rejoice, for as
soon as we learn the rigid rules
of 3 on 3 competition we will
report the progress of your
tournament. However, this
week a presentation
strictly to flickerbull is in
order.

Hail, Davidson biblioman-
iacs! Here is the moment you
have been waiting for. Fresh-
men! The next sentence you

read will be as invaluable to |

your Davidson career as a Big
Orange or a perilous climb to
the Chambermaids. KA #1
beat Off Again!

This perverse act is a once in
a lifetime affair and may never
come again. The contumacious
KA #1, led by Weldon Jor-
dan’s win of the coin toss,
baffled Off Again, 14-6.

An anonymous player
whose initials are Lee ‘‘The
Grog”’ Grogan dropped touch-
down passes right and left
that would have prevented Off
Again from being beaten.

The dazed derelicts of SPE
#1 fell prey to the normally
slow of foot, slippery handed
PDT #3, 41-0. PDT #3, led by
the TD kickoff return of Stan
“Half-pint’”’ Hales, kept our
famous off campus fraternity
scoreless,

SPE #1 was disheartened

when Rick ‘‘Stone Hands’’,

Hobson let a marshmallow
pass drift through his fingers.
On the following play, Dave
“Why me?’’ Sweeney dropped
a pass in the end zone throw
so perfect it left the imprint of
a football on his stomach that
remained for several hours.

We suggest SPE #1 change
their monicker to SPE #54
(Where are you?).

Fiji #8 kicked the dust last
Tuesday under the watchful
eyes of the ostentatious prep-
pies of SAE #1. Joe ‘“‘Wimp-
out” Winkle once again failed

to catch a TD pass for the
fickle Fijis. The spike-fitted
topsiders of SAE #1 perfor-
ated Fiji #8, 45-7.

The frowzy Pika pizzle
heads showed lack of respect
for their elders by scoring their
season high twelve points
against the ornery Old Men.
However, the virile Old Men
strutted their stuff in fine

fashion to leave the pizzles all .

petered out, and on the low
end of the score, 29-12.

The Basement Bangers
pounded the lounge lizards of
PDT #2 against the wall until
submission was evident. The
resolute PDT #2 went down
hard 33-31.

EMBO, showing no signs of

_ melioration, donned their pel-

vic girdles in an attempt to

aies re

pull themselves together ag- |
ainst the frenzied SPE #2.
However, the girdles must —

have been too tight, for

EMBO waddled ‘about the |

field like legless tortoises.
SPE #2 trounced the grounded
terrapins, 58-6.

Henderson House melted
the M&M’s 12-0 in a surpri-
singly entertaining game in
which Nora ‘‘Boola-boola’”’
McNeill scored both six-poin-
ters. A special treat of ““‘Why
Don’t We Do It in the Road”
was provided by the Hender-
son House chorus.

There is still a mystery as to
what they want to do in the
road. “Blood and Guts’’ Gil-
liam was the star for the losers
and climaxed the game by

cracking her head on an oppo-
nent.

Davidson College Tennis
team and Wildcat Club will
co-sponsor the Jim Causey
Wildcat Invitational tennis
tournament at Davidson Fri-
day through Sunday.

The tournament was foun-
ded to honor Jim Causey, son
of retired Professor of Spanish

Tennis Coach Jeff Frank, ©

Causey, formerly an accom-
plished tennis player, was
injured in an automobile acci-
dent several years ago and
partially paralyzed. He at-
tends every practice now to
observe and advise Frank
about the team.

further than doctors ever
thought he would. We wanted
to have a tribute to him and to

recognize him for the tremen-

egie, the club will provide all
funds and equipment neces-
sary for the tournament, al-
lowing the participants to play
without a fee.

Frank gives two purposes
for the tournament.

“‘We want to have a tourna-
ment so the kids on our team
can have match experierice in
which they don’t play each
other,’’ he said.

“The other is just to have a
really good weekend with lots
of good tennis.”’

Besides the Davidson tennis
team and Frank, 16 guest
players from North Carolina
will play this weekend.

‘‘We went after the best
players around the state we
could get hold of,”’ he said.

Included among the guest
players are Director of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid H.
Edmunds White and Professor
of Philosophy Lance Stell,
according to Frank.

Also ‘invited are Tal Henry,
ranked in the top ten players

of the country in the 18 and
under division, Norm Schel-

lenger, the top ranked player
in 45 and older in North

Carolina and in the top five

players in the south.

The top players from the

lantic Christian teams have
been invited.

““T’m really pleased with the
people we’ve been able to get
to come to the tournament,”’
said Frank. ‘‘The quality of
tennis will be excellent.”

The tournament will consist
of both singles and doubles
play, both determined by a
single elimination play, accor- '
ding to Frank.

The first round singles mat-
ches will be held at 12:30 and
2:00 Friday afternoon, with
the first round doubles follow-
ing immediately after—about
3:30.

Saturday morning two more
rounds of singles will be
played at 9:00 and 11:00, and
doubles will be played at 1:30
and 3:00.

Singles semi-finals will be
held Sunday morning at 10:00,
with the finals at 1:00, while
the doubles will be played at
2:30.

‘I hope we don’t do too
well in the tournament, be-
cause I hope the people we
bring in from outside will be so
strong that our kids will have
to play very well to win,”’ said
Frank.

“T will be amazed if one of
our kids wins,’’ he said. —
