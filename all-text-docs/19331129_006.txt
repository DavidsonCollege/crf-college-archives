Sophomore End

Be Chosen This Week

Davidsonian Sports Editor to
Publish His Choice in Next
Issue

Appearing in the next issue of “The
Davidsonian” will be an all-State foot-
ball eleven and the names of those
men receiving honorable mention to
this team.

It will be picked by the sports ed-
itor of “The Davidsonian,” four mem-
bers of the Reporters’ Club who have
had past experience in sports writing
on “ The Davidsonian” staff, the editor-
in-chief of this paper, and the alumni
secretary, who has seen all the games
in which Davidson has participated this
year,

The players will be picked largely
on their showing against Davidson.

Each of the seven men will pick
three teams and choose a captain for
each. Players being chosen for the
first team will be given five votes,
those chosen for the second team,
three votes, and those chosen for the
third team, one vote. The man chosen
captain will receive one extra vote.

Any other player receiving one or
more votes will be awarded honorable
mention.

PREDICTS CRIME WAVE
Col. Calvin Goddard, director of re-
search in Northwestern University’s
crime detection laboratory, predicts
another major crime wave within the
next few months.

Coley Windham, playing his
first year of varsity football, has
been outstanding on the flank po-
sition. Windham has had the job
of holding down “Shrimp” Morris’
old position, and has showed up
well throughout the season.

ing with injuries of a severe nature.
Percy McElrath, center, who sustained
a sprained arm in the William and
Mary game, and Fullback “Schnozz”
Willson, handicapped by an injured
knee, should both see action.

After a short lay-off following the
contest with W. and M., the ’Cats re-
newed training last Wednesday, and
have been drilled extensively for the
past five or six days.

The last game played by Wake For-
est this season was the one with Car-
olina, on November 11. Since that
date, the Baptists have been making
thorough preparations for the coming
imbroglio. The varsity has _ scrim-
maged frequently with the freshmen,
and the first-string men have received
stiff opposition from the
yearlings, who are reputed to have
the strongest freshman team in the
state.

Following are the games played by
Wake Forest and Davidson this sea-
son:

Since 1908, Wake Forest and David-
son have played twenty games. Of this
number, ten have been won by the
Wildcats, six by the Baptists, and the
remaining four have resulted in ties.
During the last ten years, the ’Cats
have captured only one of the nine
games played, that victory coming last
year when Halfback Charlie Pearce
intercepted a Deacon pass and ran 60
yards for the touchdown. The con-

gaged during the past twenty-five

DUKE TAKES FIRST

(Continued from page 5)

Elon had been undefeated this year
in the Little Six, and it came as a
great surprise, this stand of the Quak-
ers. This ties up the race for the
Little Six trophy, which remains un-
decided until after the Lenoir-Rhyne-
Catawba game next Thursday.
