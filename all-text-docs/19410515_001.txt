Rehearsal Of
Play Is Begun

Daily rehearsals have now begun
for the spring production of the
Red and Black Masquers, “The Girl
in the Goldfish Bowl.” The play
will be presented in Chambers au-
ditorium in about two weeks, al-
though the definite date has not
been chosen. To be produced en-
tirely by the students, “The Girl in
the Goldfish Bowl” was written by
Dan Hodges of the rising senior
class.

According to Hodges, love is bad
enough as it is, but when two room-
mates fall in love with the same
girl, there’s bound to be trouble.
Then when both boys invite this
girl down for the same dance set,
there’s bound to be more trouble.
One of the fellows is right much’of
a stud, the other a gadabout. The
question is, which boy will the girl
choose for the dances? Will brains
or brawn win out? But this com-
plication is only the first of a series
which tangles everything up in “The
Girl the Goldfish Bowl.” To
complicate matters even more, an-
other girl enters the picture, a»co-
ed—blond, beautiful, and out :for
what she can get. She is the only
coed in Solomon college, and when
she gets on the scene, it’s like
throwing firecrackers in a gasoline
tank. Somebody’s going to blow
up!

in

“Betty Kerr will play the role of
the bewitching coed who realizes
that if a girl is ever going to get
any place, she has to work fast. Bill
Lyman will take the part of Tom,
wise-cracking potential Phi Bete,
who wishes he had never fallen in
love with the other girl in the first
place, while Bill Loy will have the
role of Mark, fun-loving, girl-loving,
roommate of Tom’s, who is going to
have down the hometown girl, or
else.

“To add even more zest to the sit-
uation, there is Jesse Wooten as
Ralph who finds out that a friend
by correspondence can sometimes
turn out-to be an awful heel; Ed

“I'm rather unaccustomed to the

“T’'ve always loved Davidson,” he
said, “but in spite of this, we have

“And dn whose football team were
you the fullback?” we asked. We
thought of a football player when
we first looked at Mr. Cordon’s
towering height and broad shoul-
ders.

“Oh, you don’t understand; I’ve
acquired this football player's build
only in recent years. Why, they
wouldn’t even let me carry the wa-

“So you attended the University,”
I remarked.

“Yes, and later went to Winston-
Salem where I studied voice at Sa-

Faculty Joins
In “Field Day”

Each spring when the sun has
chased the winter chill from the
air, members of the senior class
meet their professors in an all day
gathering when both sets forsake
the classes and spend the afternoon
in many different sorts of sports.
This year they. have agreed upon
May 22 as the day for this event.

The afternoon will be devoted to
competitive sports arranged by Pete
Whittle and Holt Barnwell. They
are making arrangements for games
in golf, badminton, bowling, horse-
shoes, table tennis, and soft ball.
Each year the students look for-
ward to the goft ball game.

Ed Maxwell has arranged for a
barbecue on the golf course for
seniors and faculty after the sports

Cohn Lecture
Surveys Past

David L. Cohn gave a lecture in
Chambers Auditorium Wednesday,
May 7, at 3:15 p: m. Mr. Cohn
chose as his topic, “The Good Old
Days.” *

The lecture was a resume of his
bobk with the same title. -In the
book Mr. Cohn tried to show how
the changing attitudes and desires
of the country could be determined
by looking through Sears and Ro-
buck catalogues. These catalogues |
contain only what people want to}
buy and therefore are a good indi-
cation of what people thought about
in those days. He used to be con-
nected with Sears and Roebuck and
therefore is familiar with the cata-
logue. ;

Sing Leaders

Pictured above are the men in charge of Davidson’s second annual
fraternity sing to be held tonight on the steps of Chamber's building.
Reading from left to right, they are: Jack Phillips, Student organizer
of the program; Shaw Smith, master of ceremonies for the occasion;
and Mr. James C. Pfohl, director of music at Davidson.

hibition will be held for one week

worthy in the future.

One of the illustrations Mr. Cohn
gave was in regard to musical in-
struments. Fifty years ago there
were about fifty pages devoted to
the advertisement of musical
struments. In those days everyone
felt to some extent responsible for
entertaining the crowd when _ it
gathered together. This accounts
for the great interest in musical in-
struments. Ten years later there
were only four pages devoted to in-
