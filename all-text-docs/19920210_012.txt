Croft Stone to Pursue Career in
Music After Graduation in May

By Bryan Padrick
Defining the music
of Croft Stone is no
simple task, and a typi-
cally pigeonholing re-
view would be an in-
sult. From his campus
debut at Songwriter’s
Night in Fall 1988,
through his outstanding
Midwinter’s Festival
performance with Brad
Reddick two Saturdays
ago, Croft’s original
music has rapidly ma-
tured into a distinctive
creative sound. From
his bouncy early songs
to the haunting and
Scottish-influenced St.
James’ Reel, creating
music that clearly por-
trays his individual en-
vironment has become
Croft’s tradmark.
Entering Davidson
in 1988 as a freshman,
Croft’s music quickly became

popular through performancesof -

Mr. Free, asong born out of his
NOLS experiences in the moun-
tains of Wyoming. This song,
along with the plaintive Autumn
Song, was later recorded in a
Charlotte studio Croft’s sopho-
more year. The popular two-
song tape, featuring Reddick and
drummer Michael Glaser, circu-
lated widely throughout the
Davidson campus and beyond.
Following thisrelease witha year-
long haitus from the Davidson
campus while studying abroad in

LIFE IN
HELL .

Edinburgh, Croft returns for his
senior year with an large number
of strong and original songs.

Croft has appeared frequently
atFACs, 21-Year-Old Nights, and
a variety of other campus-wide
events, including a period as lead
guitarist/vocalist for the short-
lived, but popular campus band
Pavlov’s Dogs. Presently, how-
ever, Croft has decided to move

‘forward.

On the strength of his impres-
sive musical talent and with the
supportofhis fledgling production
company, Wind River Music, upon

graduation Croft plans
to begina series of dates
in clubs and_ bars
throughout the South-
east and Mid-Atlantic
States.

Though clearly
drawing from influ-
ences such as Simon
and Garfunkle and Bob
Dylan, Croft’s music
has nevertheless ma-
tured well beyond mere
imitation of these
greats. Croft has devel-
oped a diverse and per-
sonal style resulting in
the consistent produc-
tion of intelligent and
highly entertaining
songs. Ben Gilmer, a
long-time friend and
close companion of
Croft, commented that
“perhaps Croft’s great-
est assest is his ability
to transform emotion
into music.” Certainly it is this
ability that allows Croft to com-
pose his music, as his greatest in-
fluence is unquestionably an
acutely emotional awareness of his
environment.

Fortunately, you’!] never hear
Croft’s music on Patterson Court,
as his music is meant for the care-
ful listener--not those who’drather
be elsewhere. It is this special
quality which makes Croft’s mu-
sic art, and on a campus drowning
ina stagnant pool of Grateful Dead
and other classic-rock clones, his
presence is refreshing.
