Menkhaus

Continued from page 1
six panel members advocated US
intervention. They concluded that
since anarchy broke out with the
government’s collapse in 1990
which lead to the subsequent fam-
ine, some military might was the
most likely means of installing
enough order to halt the looting
and fighting.

By 1992, “fighting over terri-
_ tory ceased to matter,” Menkhaus
said, because all that remained in
Somalia was food relief. Conse-
quently food became power and

’ the rival factions turned their, at-"

tention to areas of food entry, stor-
age, and transport. Even if the
United Nations orany reliefagency
‘had been able to forge an agree-
ment with factions, the constant
threat of the numerous teenage
bandits would thwart any safety
guarantees.

At the time Menkhaus and his
fellow members decided that in-
tervention would be most success-
ful, the State Department ada-
mantly opposed the idea. Yet one
month later “something dramatic
happened,” as Menkhaus recalled
because President Bush was mov-
ing ahead with intervention. While
the reasons for Bush’s decision
remain unclear, Somalia did pro-

vide a unique area of military in-
tervention where the risks and costs
would be low and the yields could
prove quite high.

Since November the short term
intervention goal to stop the fam-
ine has generally been successful,
with food relief reaching deep into
the country where starvation is far
worse than expected. The long term
U.S. and U.N. goals of national
reconciliation and the establish-
mentofaSomali governmentmake
Menkhaus less hopeful.

According to Menkhaus, the
goals themselves are bonafide, but
the current talk of U. S. military
removal threatens any chance for

> further progress. The only force
the Somalis respect is the United
States military and to establish a
nonshooting U.N. unit alone would
provoke a political quagmire. In-
stead, Menkhaus proposed, they
should “blur the lines” between
US. and U.N. forces to the point
where the people no longer know
the difference between the two.

The other main threat to
progress is the United States” and
United Nation’s recognition of the
country’s various warlords as it’s
main political leaders. Not only
are these “slugs” not interested in
brokering peace, they are incapable
of it, said Menkhaus.

A more feasible governing
“group would be the community

leaders, or”’silent majority,” whose Pe

voices are only just beginning to
reemerge. The intervention al-
lowed these Muslim clerics, teach-
ers, doctors, and local organizers
to feel safe. If the U.S. goes ahead
with removal these possible lead-
ers will return to hiding and the
warlords and teenagers willremain
in control.

Even without these policy
mistakes Menkhaus sees Somalia
looming dangerous. It is a country
of vendettas, where blood com-
pensation remains the norm. Also
these teenagers are only trying to
survive and will need substantial
economic rationale to induce them
to lay down their arms. Menkhaus
believes that it would be impos-
sible to disarm the Somali popula-
tion, but ifthe United States would
patrol more, its military threat

would force people to bury their |

guns.

Menkhaus concluded his talk
by stating that he is “cautiously
optimistic” about Somalia’s future.
If the community leaders can force
enough pressure on the country
then the hopes of restoring govern-
ment is a better possibility. The
Somalis are an entrepreneurial

‘people, he noted, and given the

opportunity couldreconstructtheir
nation.

NCSL

Tempore of the House, Mary
Randolph ’95 asa bill author in the
House, Seth McLaughlin ’93 and
Kyle Kinner ’93 in the House, and
by two freshmen, Brian Frances
and Kate Laidlaw, who will serve
in the Senate. Any other NCSL
members who wish to attend will
serve in the House of Representa-
tives and on Bill Committees.

The Davidson Bill is a consti-
tutional amendment to allow
greaterreligious freedom under the
North Carolina document, which
contains a clause permitting an
elected official to be disqualified
from office for “denying the exist-
ence of Almighty God.” Inthe bill,
co-authored by Kirkland and
Randolph, that clause is striken
because they believe it to be dis-
criminatory and unconstitutional
under the federal constitution.

Other bill topics include lim-
iting terms for NC legislators, ban-
ning abortions in NC, environmen-
tal protection measures, year-long
schools, and establishing bifur-
cated trials for insanity.

“T expect debate to be heated,
especially concerning abortion - I
hope it is intelligent and well-re-
searched as well,” said Kirkland.
“Above all, our purpose is to learn
the process, not just rail at each
other.” No matter whether these
measures pass or fail, it will be an
exciting week for the Davidson
students who fight it out on the
floor of the Old Capital chambers.

In an effort to include the
Davidson campus in their activi-
ties, the NCSL is planning a
schoolwide debate on term limits
to, be held early in February. The

exact date and time will be adver-
tised on flyers. The proposition up
for debate is worded positively,
stating that term limits of four terms
for Representatives and two terms

* for Senators" SHOULD BE im=""

posed. Many voters endorsed term
limits during the election in No-
vember; the measure passed in all
fourteen states in which it was on
the ballot. Consequently, the topic
_ is sure to impact our government
in the near future.
Given the importance of the

topic, the NCSL hopes that many _

students and professors will turn
out to debate one another. Not
only will everyone benefit from
heating different views on what is
best for our government, but those
attending the Legislative Session
in March will get practice debating
under the rules of the House of
Representatives of the Student
Legislature.

The Davidson delegation
meets in the Wilson Room of the
Union every Tuesday night at8:30
to debate and get organized for
Session. Any student or faculty
member who is interested in what
these students do to represent
Davidson in the state is encour-
aged to join, especially if they have
any interest in law, research, or
debate.

NCSL is a charted, funded
organizationat Davidson, and most
of the delegation’s budget goes to
pay for Session, which is $95 per
student. The state-wide organiza-
tion will meet at Guilford College
January 29-31 to debate resolu-
tions, and again in February at
UNC-Chapel Hill. At Guilford,
the NCSL will debate several top-
ics including banning smoking in
all public areas in NC, education
reform, ‘and making March
Women’s History Month.
