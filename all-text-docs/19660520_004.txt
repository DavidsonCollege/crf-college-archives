Long Iliness Compels
Retirement By Beaty

As a result of a severe heart
attack early in the school year,
E. A. Beaty will officially: re-
tire from teaching at the end
of this year.

Beaty has taught at Davidson
for 41 years and for some time
before that at the University of
Tennessee. During his career,
he has taught five languages:
Latin, Greek, German, Italian
and English.

Beaty says that he is still an
“invalid” but is ‘‘doing much

better.” He spends most of his
time reading, mainly history, at
his home in Davidson.

He graduated from Davidson,
earned masters degrees at South
Carolina and Columbia and re-
ceived his BD from Columbia
Theological Seminary. He has
spent two summers in Europe
and has studied in Rome and
at the University of Munich.

Beaty was very upset at a re-
cent article in THE DAVIDSON-

IAN which said Davidson pro-
fessors do not often participate
in politics. He pointed out that
he was mayor of the town of

Covington Discusses

New Union

Tom Covington, assistant dean
of students, will become assist-
ant. director of the Union next
year. He will fill the position va-
cated by Sterling Martin. who
_will) become assistant track
coach.

As assistant director of the
Union. Covington will be in-
. volved with Union activities,
placement and student extracur-
ricular activities in general. His
administrative relationship with
fraternities, however, will re-
main the same.

Part of the reason for the
change is a result of his work

_ with fraternities. Formerly, all
student activities except fra-
ternity activities were centered
in the Union. Covington han-
dled fraternity business from his
position as assistant dean of
Students. Now all student ac-
tivities can be handled through
Covington in his new position
with the Union.

‘“The purpose of this change.”
said Covington, ‘‘is not to absorb
fraternities into Union direc-
tion, but to enhance fraternity

forcement," was sent back to
Covington’s committee for furth-
er work.

Second Vice-President Tom
Earnhardt outlined the proposed

activities with what the Union
can provide. I feel that this ar-
rangement will be more effec-
tive.”

The resources of the Union|}
should now be more available to!
fraternities, he continued.

‘I'm enthusiastic about the
move,”” said Covington. “I feel
that we can certainly do at least)
as well as we've done in the
past, and probably much bet-
ter,”

change the present set-up in

Davidson will have no applied
math department next year due
to the retirement of Professor
W. N. Mebane this summer.

Mebane, who has taught at
Davidson for 43 years, sald, ‘‘No
one else will teach the course,
so the only applied math of-
fered will be a computer course
under Dr. (J. H.) Roberts.”

Mebane will spend his time
“traveling, fishing and continu-
ing my private surveying work.”
