COLLEGE RECORDS FALL

Records in Two Mile Run and Pole
Vault Broken

By ‘taking all three places in the high
jump and first place in the broad jump,
Duke University was able last Saturday to
nose out Davidson in one of the most thrill-
ing and spectacular track meets cver held
at Davidson. Up until these last two events.
Davidson was holding a lead of eight points,
and the outcome was by no means certain.
However, Duke was able to make a clean
sweep in the high jump and took first place
in the broad jump, thus giving them a two-

point margin to win by the score of 64
to 62.
Despite unfavorable weather conditions,

two college records were broken, and many
spectacular and close races were run, The
first of these records to be broken was that
of the pole vault, in which Billy Flinn,
Sophomore, cleared the bar at a height of
eleven feet, four inches, breaking the college:
record by one inch.

Scarcely had the first-record falien when
another old record fell into the dust. This
time, Brannon, Davidson two-miler, came
in almost half a lap ahead of his Duke op-
ponent, to set a new record of ten minutes
7.6 seconds, breaking his old record by more
than twelve seconds.

High scorer for the afternoon was Brown-
lee of Duke, who garnered 13 of his team’s
points by winning first place in the 100 and
220-yard dashes, and in the
hurdles,

Results of the meet are as follows:

Kittens Beaten by
Charlotte High, 6-0

Failure to'solve the slants of Bub Mulli-
gan spelled defeat for the Davidson Fresh-
man nine at the hands Central High
School last Friday afternoon in Charlotte.
The score was 6 to 0.

Mulligan, after a bad start in the first
inning which cost him nothing, pitched superb
ball throughout the rest of the game and
was never in danger. He allowed the Wild-
kittens only three singles, each of which
came in different innings, and struck out
thirteen batters.

Central High gathered their hits to score
four runs in the third and two more in the
seventh innings. Eight walks
Koonce were also taken to advantage by
the Charlotte nine.

Smyre at short played a nice game for the

Freshmen, handling seven chances in good
style. Alexander, Wildkitten left fielder,
turned in the niftiest play of the game when
he took Bell's lineodrive along the foul line
with his bare hand.

The Freshmen now have a record of one
game won and two lost.

child’s play. His running form is pretty to
watch, for. the very simplicity and steadi-

He will be heard from in the state meet
this year, unless we are far wrong. Bau-
com, Carolina two-mile ace, ran the dis-

non last Saturday.

DAVIDSON NINE

TROUNCES ELON |

The Davidson Wildcats gained sweet re-
venge last week by trouncing the Elon nine
on the home diamond by the score of 15
to 8. Playing under perfect weather condi-
tions, the Davidson batsmen found their bat-
ting eyes to garner 17 hits off of two Elon
pitchers and this, combined with frequent
errors, gave them an easy victory.

George Bailey hurled good ball for seven
innings, allowing the Christians only
shits. However, he was touched for a trio in
the eighth and gave way to Croker, who
finished the last stanza.

six

Ross started in the pitcher's box for Elon
but was removed after the rampaging Wild-
cats had batted around, scoring five runs.
Zeb Harrington, brought. in from shortstop,
stemmed the tide temporarily but soon the
Wildcats solved his ball, and concentrating
on three innings scored ten more runs.

Extra base knocks were frequent, with
Mathis leading the field with a double and
a triple. Mathis and Proctor divided per-
centage batting honors for Davidson, both
getting three hits out of four trips to bat.
Williams hit best for Elon with three hits
out of five to his credit.

General Electric Contributions to Health
