Every year about
this time, the eight
best teams in the
Southern Confer-
ence play in a tour-
nament at Raleigh.
This year the South
Carolina Gamecocks
were rated in first
place, for they have
won mine consecu-
tive games. This is
one of the best re-
cords a team has
had in many years.
The Blue Devils of
Duke, — defending
champions, were selected second; North Carolina third;
and Citadel fourth. The other teams selected in this champ-
ionship tourney, based on their loop records, were Clem-
son, N.C. State, William and Mary, and Maryland. It was
thought that Davidson might go, but something beyond
our control prevented that. N

By FRITZ KEESLER

Tournament officials said that the University of Rich-
mond, which came out in second place, let-it be known that
they would be unable to accept an invitation to the tour-
nament because of epidemic of mumps. This is too bad
(for South Carolina) for the Spiders have a good, team.

Many fans think that South Carolina will win the
tourney. However, North Carolina has a fine team on the
floor. Last_year Duke beat North Carolina in the finals.
but this year we hope that they will beat Duke in any
game.

Wildcats :

_ This past week the Wildcats won two conference
games. They beat both Furman and Clemson, and in these
games the team looked better than it has for weeks. Coach
Shepard’s boys used a zone defense, which seemed to
have taken the other teams by surprise and worked very
smoothly. However, the offense also looked very excellent.
The Cats have about four or five more games to play this
season, and let’s hope they can win them all, for we all
will be out fighting too. :

Intramurals

Fraternity basketball is now moving at full speed.
At the present time the Betas seem to be on top, for they
have lost but one game. There have been some good games
while others have been rough, with poor ball being played.
There is a great interest in these games, and the boys try
‘their hearts out for their dear ole Fraternity. Some of
the games have gotten pretty rough, and I have expected
several to end in a fight, but so far none have. Dumbo
seems to be one of the roughest, ones, for he likes football
better. Little Lingeberger is one of the best Fraternity
players around. He is a good shot and is as fast as greased
lightening. The Betas are out on top, but both the S.P.E.’s
and the Independents are looking good. The Pika-Pi
Kapps are gradually gaining momemtum as the season
rolls by. They played a very interesting ang} rough game
with Kappa Sigs and show excellent promise for the fu-
ture.

Spring Sports
Spring is not too far off and with spring comes base-
ball. Last year the Davidson baseball team did not have
smuch luck. They won only one game, and it is not known
for sure whether they will have a team this year or not. If
there is a team it probably won’t be very good, but it will
be fun for those who try to play.

| Also with spring comes tennis and golf. There is
some talk of a tennis team. I have heard’a lot of boys
talking about playing tennis, but you.can’t tell how good
they are until you see them play. Maybe there are some
good players around here, and if there is, let the coach
know. If there is enough interest maybe there will be a
team. Let’s hope so, for it’s a fine game.

There-will probably be no golf team this year. How-
ever, Phil Whitter says that he is going to play in the
10,000. Charlotte Open in March. Lets wish him luck
against some of the big boys.
