southern Conference Offers
Davidson Invitation To Return

By Bruce Balestier

Less than one year after leav-
ing independent status to join the
Big South Conference, it appears
that a rekindling of Davidson’s
longtime affiliation with the South-
ern Conference may be in the off-
ing.

Davidson left the Southern
Conference in 1988.

According to Assistant Ath-
letic Director Sterling Martin, the
Southern Conference first offered
the invitation before the NCAA
Convention in Nashville, and de-

sired a reply during the conven-
tion. As it stands now, Davidson
has until March 1 to decide.

The expansion-minded South-
ern Conference, which recently
announced the addition of Georgia
Southern as its ninth member,
presently is comprised of Appala-
chian State, Tennessee-Chat-
tanooga, The Citadel, Marshall,
Virginia Military: Institute, West-
ern Carolina, East Tennessee State
and Furman,

Commissioner-elect Wright
Waters revealed that, while pres-

ent Conference statute mandates a
maximum of 12 member schools,
there is sentiment among present
members to raise that ceiling to 14
schools and divide into two divi-
sions.

Waters characterized
Davidson as a “great institution”
and said that Davidson’s “academic
reputation, we believe, fits neatly”
with the other schools in the con-
ference.

He declined to comment on
other schools being considered in
the conference’s expansion plans.

Davidson Wins First On The
Road Against Campbell

By Bruce Balestier

Davidson entered Monday
evening’s matchup with Campbell
in Fayetteville with a 3-9 overall
record, 1-4 in Big South play, and
faced the prospect of falling ir-
revocably out of the Conference
title picture.

Though no doubt harried by a
voluminous crowd of 371 at the
Cumberland County Civic Center,
the Wildcats quickly showed them-
selves equal to the task at hand.

A’ three-pointer by Paul
Denmond commenced, anda three
by Janko Narat concluded, a 19-3
spurt that transformed an early 5-1

deficit into a commanding 20-8
cushion for the ‘Cats with 9:06 to
play in the opening stanza.

The lead swelled to 13 points
at 30-17 on a James Marsh basket
with 3:58 left before Campbell
scored the final 7 points of the half
to close to 30-24 at the break.

A jump hook by Detlef Musch
gave the Wildcats their biggest lead
of the second half at 41-32 with
14:48 remaining _ before
Campbell’s Rod Gourdine took
control. Gourdine, who finished
with 21 points to lead all scorers,
poured in 11 points during a 16-3
run that gave the Camels a 48-44

Radford 5-0
Coastal Carolina 2-0
Augusta 4-1
Winthrop 2-2
Davidson 3-5
Charleston Southem 2-5
UNC-Asheville 1-2
Campbell 0-4

lead with 6:20 to play.

The ‘Cats returned the favor,
however, with a 15-5 surge to end
the game.

A three-point play by Marsh
gave Davidson the lead for good at
55-53 with 1:51 to go, and free
throws in the final minute by
Denmond, Jason Zimmerman and
Narat iced the ‘Cats’ 59-53 win.

Musch and Narat each con-
tributed 10 points.

The win, Davidson’s first on
the road this season, was the team’s
fourth of the season, equaling the
team’s output of victories forall of
last season.
