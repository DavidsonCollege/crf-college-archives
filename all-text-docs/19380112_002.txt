The New Infirmary. ..

Davidson Colege, its student? freuity,
alumni, and all. connected with the insti-
ution can well be proud of the new in-
tirmary. Not only is there inst reason to
he proud of the adeauate and up-to-date
medical iacilities and the «well-iurnished
hospital rooms. but there is &ven more
reason to be proud of the iaet that the first
store in the foundation of Davidson Co)-
legeis building campaign has becn laid.

Those. who through their generons dona -
tions enabled the building of the infirmary
can fecl that they have done the College a
great serviee. a service that will be lasting
iw the future of Davidson College. To those
iriends, we express our heart-ieit grati-
tude. Our greatest appreciation goes also
to those who, through their efforts in other -
than pecuniary ionn, aided in the erection
oi the iniirmary.

Davidson College has made a great stride
in progress. Need we say more?

Poll Results...

Results of the-You_Be The Eciitor” poll
were most informative and provided us, the
staff, with a most advantageous key to what
the student body wants in its paper. How-
ever, do not expect that your suggestions
will necessarily be earried out right away
oratall. If humanly possible and advisable,
“your ideas will be incorporated into the
paper.

Without a doubt, the main want of the
papet is informal campus snapshots, ac-
cording to student opinion. And we would
be giad to oblige if only we were not on the
rock bottom of oar cue fund already.

Beginning with this issue, we resume
“Campus Comments” under a different
name, at your request. To you freshmen,

Miss Shaw gave | unstintingly of her

Anti-Nazi League...

A rather interesting and striking piece of
propaganda literature came to us via the
| mails some days ago. Entitled “The Anti-
| Nazi Bulletin,” the main purpose of that
issue seemed to be the instruction of the
Anti-Nazi League members how to success-
tullly maintain and cortinue their Anti-
--German Boycott.

For these instmictions, we quote
paragraph:

Recent Nazi-German developments in
the field of medicine include a quinine
substitute known as ‘Atebrin’ and some
new pectin preparations for the control
of internal and external hemorrhages.
Physicians and pharmacists should
guard against the use of these products.
Examine labels for the ‘Made in Ger-
many’ mark.”

Senior Slants
“The Davidson Man, Off the Campus”

last week-end I found myself

‘dumming”’ from towns where “bumming”
is hard.

Bath times the simple word Dav-
idson, worked the
magic of stopping a
car, and I’ was given
to understand that
the ride was offered
in each ease because
| was a Davidson stu-
dent. There is a
store in Charlotte
where, to get credit,
one need only estab-
lish himself as a Dav-

idson student. The same truth may be ap-
plied in many other, similar cases.

What~is this strange power-of_the. wo
Davidson, which is an “open Sesame” to
many doors? Our college has a tradition;
this means that the student bocly has a tra-
dition ‘upon it, as though it were not a
changing group but a permanent part of the
campus like the eternal old duildings. Ob-
viously there must be some basis for such a
reputation. We have received this heritage
irom other generations and’ other classes.
Now every day, especially over week-ends,
we have opportunity to verify and spread
such a name for our student body.

Every Saturday and Sunday there arc
usually at least one hundred boys off the
campus, seattered widely about this terri-
tory. Many of ahese are bumming and are
given rides by drivers, knowing them to be
Davidson men. Many are guests in homes;
all come in contaet with many outsiders who
know that chey are irom Davidsos.

What Fm getting at is this. A student is
the ‘best advertisement for a sehool. Often,
the opinion} that others form of you, deter-
mines their opinion of Davidson. In one
town I know of, our school is highly regard-
ed because of one graduate living there. In
another it suffers a rathed shoddy reputa-
tion because of one alumnus there. As you
travel about the country, you are a walking
advertisement of the type of student body
at Davidson.

Cnucomplainingly and witih scldom

her daily task, intent upon doing
only what she believed to be her
duty. A wotan of unusual culture
and accomplishment, she was many

persistentiy declined. This was in
keeping with hee high roned innate
modesty. She craved no publicity
but constantly shunned it. prefer-|

vised an “emotion meter,” which he
says measures the capacity of one's
mood for love by the perspiration
in the palm of the hand.

“The tnachine would be of little |
use to the unenlightened swain, said
Prof. C. A. Ruckmick, the inventor,
because it takes a trained psychol-
ogist to interpret the romantic side
of the readings.

The meter measures all types of
emotional disturbances, including
anger, fear, joy, and that produced
by lying. Lie detectors generally re-
ly on changes in blood pressure and
breathing, he said, but in his opin-
ion hand perspiration is more re-
