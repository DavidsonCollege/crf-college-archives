Vanishing Records
Plague Music Lab

By BRUCE CORSER
Asst. Managing Editor

Herbert Russel] Jr.. ad-
ministrative assistant in the
Music Department. has con-
firmed that the seemingly
perennial loss of musical scores
and records from the record
library is continuing this
year
“ One example he recalled in
particular was the recent loss of
an album dealing with the
history of jazz. This one collec-
tion was valued at a retail cost
of $60.

Russell said he believed that
this and other missing items
were probably sitting in
someo1:e's room. However. he
added that he thought that their
removal from the library was
probably done innocently

Russell pointed out that
cassettes or records can't be
removed from the library
because this would enable
people to reproduce them Em-
phasizing that this ‘‘all stems
back to Federal Copyright
laws. he revealed that “‘recor-
dings can't be reproduced even
by an educational institution
We have to abide by copyright
laws to keep trom being sued

Russel] then related that the
college had a fine collection ot
recordings with examples ot
type of musi¢

almost ever’

However. the library operates
on a very limited budget and the
loss of scores and recordings
necessitates the expenditure of
part of this budget on their
replacement. “Some _ records
can't be replaced anymore.’ he
continued

Another problem facing the
listening lab is the breakage of
equipment. Russel] mentioned
that once three units of listening
and recording equipment were
broken at the same time. This is
compounded by the rocketing
costs of repairs. Although the
library features 15 listening
tables. Russell said. ‘‘Our
biggest headache is trying to
keep up with the students. "

The library is used primarily
by students in Music 21. a music
appreciation course. yet many
departments make frequent use
of the lab. Among others Rupert
Barber's drama classes. some
of Chalmers Davidson's history
courses. and Honors College
students require use of the
library

What s ahead for the record
library” Russell suggested that
the “ideal set-up would be one
complete listening and recor-
ding center This set-up would
include both a language lab and
a record librars He ottered the
alternative ot either having
such 4 center in a new Union or
in the soon to be vacated library

nment and politics. and en-
vironmental sciences “I'd say
that one third of the teachers
who started in the program are
still with it.’ said Bevan

Bevan commented that
students have added a new
dimension to the program. They
enjoy talking with the teachers.
and both teachers and students
profit from the contact.

There will be two sessions
One will last from June 13 to
July 2: and the other from
July 9 to July 28. Students who
wish to participate in the
program should contact
Professor William B. Hight

The Extended — Studies
program and independent study
will be arranged much the same
as they were during the regular
school year. Bevan. speaking
about the independent study
program said, “It’s a kind of in-
tensive program for him ‘the
student): he has more time to
work on his own.’

Students who would like to
enroll in either of these two
programs should arrange for-
mal contracts with respective
professors. Bevan will endorse
independent study projects, and
Professor Randall R. Kincaid
will endorse Extended Studies
contracts.

Registration will take place
during the regular June and
July registration periods,

The Abnormal Psychology
Summer Program combines
Psychology 131 and Psychology
231. Open to a limited number of
students, the session is designed
to give the participant a prac-
tical learning experience.

“They participate in the en-
tire hospital effort. If you want
to take abnormal psychology.
that's the way to take it.”’ said
Bevan.

of the fine arts program, and
improvement of athletic

“An important part of the

to Lane. “involves deciding
what direction growth of the
college will take.”

Possible alternatives include
expansion in the direction of
Patterson Court or in the direc-
tion of the athletic practice

Lane pointed out that such
decisions served to “redefine
the Davidson community. Each
element. if changed. will alter
the social patterns of the com-

Former SGA President Ralph
Peeples presented a report on
the actions of the Student Lite
Committee (SLC) on Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Random House
regarding alleged pledging and
bidding violations.

The results of the action.
Peeples said, “is that the off-
campus organizations are being
given a chance to work within
the Davidson social system.”

While the off-campus
organizations were denied
membership to the Patterson
Court Council, they will be
allowed to participate in the
Council on Social Organizations

An important aspect ot this
action by the SLC, according to
Peeples, is that it is the first ot-
ficial recognition of the off-
campus organizations by the
college

In other business, the Senate
voted to appropriate $20 to send
two senators to the National
Student Lobby Convention in

Wine Tasting Results

Davidson College students
don't seem to be any different
from other students across the
country, at least as far as their
wine preferences are con-
cerned.

In a nationally sponsored

program of wine-tasting Parties
conducted by the Wine Growers
of California. the California
wines used in the experiment
were preferred about 85 percent
of the time over imported wines
Costing almost twice as much.
_ The results of the poll were
taken from more than 33.000
students in roughly 600 testings.
with over 150 Davidson students
participating.

All of the tastings were con-
ducted similarly. with the

‘labels of the four wines used

(two locally purchased Califor-
nia wines and two foreign ones )

being hidden. so as not to
discriminate unfairly one way
or the other.

The participants were in-
structed to rate the wines on
such catagories as bouquet.
flavor, and aroma.
