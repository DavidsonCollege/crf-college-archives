New York—(IP)—More and more the
duty of a women’s college should be to train
its students in how to use their leisure time,
Robert M. Maclver, Lieber Professor of
Political Philosophy and Sociology at Bar-
nard College, Columbia University, said in
in address before the alumnae of the college
here.

“This is a college of the fancy,” He said.
“It is dedicated to the art of living and not,
directly, to the art of making a living. It
is based on the presumption that practical
techniques for the latter purpose are best
acquired schools, and that the
looming leisure of the future makes it highly
needful to educate the young for life and
leisure no less than for the working day.

“The principle of our college is this, that

groups, the division of the eternal, includ-
ing the main group of sciences; and the di-

kind.

“The final purpose is to show the relation
of the two so that in the business of living
the student may learn the place of each.
Every student will, therefore, choose a focus
of interest in division, around which
other “courses will be centered. This
plan is specially conceived for a college for
women, because the task of adjustment at
once to the changing and the unchanging
is perhaps of special significance for them.”

Prof. Maclver chairman the com-
mission of seventeen economists appointed
last by Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler
to investigate the economic crisis, with par-
ticular reference to methods of production
and exchange.

Philadelphia—(1P)—There’s a battle of the

Co-eds are inconsistent, husband hunters ;
they “fawn and gush,” charges a male critic.

Men students are kéy hunters, fops, ill-

This all appears in the January issue of
the Owl, for which Edward W.
Groshell, man student at Temple, and Miss

League, tell what they. would like to be like
if they belonged to-the opposite-sex.

| Chesterfields are

Milder

HEN you ask a Chesterfield
smoker why that’s his brand — he
generally comes right out flat-footed and
says...‘‘It’s because They’re Milder!”’

. So we’re going to keep on doing
everything we know how to keep them

That’s why we look for and buy the
mildest and ripest tobaccos we can get.
That’s why we age them in our ware-
houses till they’re mellow and sweet.

We believe that even the shredding
of the tobacco. ..and the quality of the
paper it’s rolled in, have a lot. to. do
with the even-drawing, mild smoke that
Pptupie enjoy in Chesterfields.

You can bank on this...every method
known to science is used to make Chest-
erfield a milder, better-tasting cigarette
that satisfies.
