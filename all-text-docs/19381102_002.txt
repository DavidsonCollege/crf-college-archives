al” Davidson supporters for single cuts on
football week-ends, but doesn’t the number
of students at the Furman game last week
prove that the majority of them were just
“blowing off?”

Every time an announcement is made
in assembly about double cuts we boo and
say that the school doesn’t want us to at-
tend our own football games, but when the
week-end around that the student
hody voted as its single cut week-end, less
than a hundred boys attend the football
game. In fact, if it hadn’t been for the Band
and the Clemson students our cheering sec-
tion would have been sadly lacking.

exercise the privilege. Either show up or

Campus Comments

It is a trite remark to say that life is
made up of a series of choices. And yet, like
most trite sayings, there is a great deal of
truth in that statement. Every person is
confronted from to with situa-
tions which ‘involve a choice between two

time time

or more alternatives often in-

compatible. When you decided to come to

which are
Davidson, you gave up, at least for a time,
the possibility of going to Carolina. When
you decided to major in political science,
you had to give up the idea of taking those
courses in philosophy which you wanted so
much to take.

One choice that has always confronted
men is the decision as to wheré: their al-
legiance rightly belonged. We are told that
Robert E, Lee was offered positions of high
rank in the Union Armies and that it was
only after nights of intenSe anguish and
sleeplessness that he made the great de-
cision that his allegiance lay with the South.
And then, when he made that decision, he
threw himself wholeheartedly into the con-
flict on the side he knew was right.

I have said all this to get to say that we
here at Davidson need to take time out and
decide just where we owe our altegiance. I
think that my first allegiance, as a David-

son man, belongs to Davidson College. Then *

it follows naturally that any other organi-
zation within the claith my
support only to the extent that it contributes
to the good of Davidson College as a whole.

Now, apply this simple principle to any
situation which has arisen here at David-
son. There has recently been quite a bit of
unrest and dissatisfaction
body.

college can

our student
feel that that unrest has been largely
a misunderstanding of the circum-
stances and to a misplacement of allegiance.
A very disagreeable situation might be
turned into a very healthy one if each party
involved could only adopt an attitude of
interest in the position of. the other and a
desire to understand that position. Then a
solution could surely be found which would
be based upon genuine mutual understand-
ing and upon the general betterment of
Davidson College. Then, and then only, will
our allegiance be properly placed.

But then, when we -have found where
our allegiance belongs, we have only made
a beginning. It is then our duty to do as
Lee did: to defend what we believe to be
right, and to attack what we believe to be
wrong. When we have done that, we can be
sure; that we have built a better Davidson.

: Letters To

The Editor

Dear Bill:

Last week there appeared in The
Davidsonian a letter from one us-
ing the nom de plume “Fed Up,”
who seemed rather incensed about
the choices made by ODK on
tap day some ten days ago.

Before going to bat on this issue
I would like to explain my position.
I am a Senior who has an intense

its

love for Davidson and the highest
respect for Omicron Delta Kappa.
I am not going to sign my name
to this letter because there are some
who would immediately decide that
Iam “smooching” the latter organ-
ization, if I may be allowed to use
a colléquial slang term. Nothing,
thoughts.

In years here I have
seen seven ODK tap days and each
time have heard criticism
tapped and of the fraternity
tapping them. The personal
opinions different people are
bound to be different. Even when
we elect our highest officer, the
student body prds@lent, there is al-
Ways a minority who does not think
that he Jig the man for the
People are just like that.

Personally, | heartily agree with
ODWA that it made the best choices
and am sure that the majority of
the student body will back me up
in this. Naturally there are some
who disagree and I respect their
opinions, They have a perfect right
to them. However, I do not see why
anyone should want to air such an
opinion publicly. It cannot possibly
do any good and will only hurt the
feelings of the men at whom it is
directed, who have been
given ODK bids. I hope that none
of them took “Fed Up” seriously
or think that his was a majority
opinion,

During

deliberately set about getting the|
reaction of as many students as}
to his letter and have
found that about ninety per cent
would like to know who he is so
they could tell him to his face just
how little they think of him and
his-tactics. However, I don't blame
him for refusing reveal his
name. If I were small enough to
do such a cowardly thing, I'd keep

my name a secret, too.
—UROB.

Dear Bill:
Who does “Fed Up” think he

is? Who is he to say that “certain
individuals better get a dictionary
and look up a certain word?” Is
he the power to be on the David-
son campus? If so, why wasn’t he
one of the. seven men tapped for
one of honors that a
man at get in the
way of recognition for leadership?

And furthermore, why isn't

Dear Bill:

be in every group several always
grumbling, never-satisfied people
such as “Fed-Up” who wrote the
letter in last week's paper? Omi-

Hallowe'en, the night of spooks,
goblins, and weird tales has come

and gone almost unnoticed, It v
so far an anti-climax in compari-
son to the adventures of Orsen
Welles Sunday night that it was
swept into oblivion. It was reported
that twice as many people “got re-
ligion” as during the last appear-
ance of Halley’s comet. Of special
note were Andy Turner and party
beside the road with Footsie Cow-
an in the amen corner, and Bitts

ing the sky for another missil.

The real news, course comes
from other campuses such as
Queens where five girls fainted and
3revard where ‘four boys needed
the smelling salts; but we pick the
Appalachian boy who when _ he
found his girl sobbing on another
boy’s shoulder said, “End of time
or no end of time, tend to your own
girl; she’s mine.” ;

We are sorry but we must make
an apology at this time. We prom-
ised you that in this column this
year we would always give you the
latest and straightest dope; now a
month later we have failed. We are
still trying to find for interview
purposes the person who claims
to have doped out the fact that the

of

Davidson drum-majors were not
really mixed up at the Carolina
game—only fooling.

We always try to give credit
where credit is due, and this week
we wish to really thank Tom Mar-
chant and Henry Mills for putting
on the Furman-Davidson tea dance,
one of the best ever held in these
parts. The Greenville lassies also
lived up to the highest expecta-
tions: John Latimer being espe-
cially well pleased and much en-
vied. The Wildcats proved them-
selves a fighting aggregation which
just could not be denied with Bill
Davis accused of “hiding his light
under bushel” although he al-
most gave the coaches apoplexy.

week include Octpus Tommy

Act Forces Western Union To
Shorten Hours

“The far-reaching effects of the
Fair Labor Standards Act will be
brought home to telegraph users
on October 24th, the effective date
of the act, when the local Western
Union Office will have to shorten
its working hours” it is announced
by Mr. Gaffney, Manager of the
office.

“The requirements of the act
imposed a burden which the Tele-
graph Company is unable to meet.”
said Mr. Gaffney, “and while it is
the traditional desire of my “Com-
Pany to serve the public when it
wants to be served, we have no
alternative under Present business
conditions, but to shorten ‘the hours.

We have, however, arranged our
open hours to give the maximum
service to our customers. The
office will be open at 8:30 a. m,
close from noon to 1:30 p. m., and
close for the day at 6:30 p. m. As
an indication of the Company's at-
titude toward its employees, Mr.
Gaffney said, “I will work fewer
hours, but my weekly pay envelope
will not contain any less.”
