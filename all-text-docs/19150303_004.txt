ORCHESTRA AND GLEE CLUB
HAVE SPLENDID TRIP.

Saturday night, the 27th, che Orches-
tra and Glee Club returned from their
annual tour. “hey reported a fine trip.
and good audiences at most points, ‘The
men who took the trip were Pe C. Harp-

er, W. A. MelIwaine, T. Johnston,
C. B. Bailey, J. Eb. Faw, W. ‘G. Mor-
rison, J. b. Payne, F. Baker. W. H

Neal, C. W. Ansley; D "M. MecGeachy,
FE. P. Childs, J. B. Faison, J. Lb. Fowle,
and UL. M. Thomas.

Monday night, the 22nd, they gave a
soncert at Winthrop, which met with
quite an ovation from the audience, some
even goin so far as to sav thar it war
the hest thing that had been there dur-
ing the year. “The audience was rather
small, due in part to the absence of many
of the college girls for the holidays.

‘Tuesday night a cancert was given al
Greenville Woman's College to a small
audience. ‘The rain was the only thing
that kept it from being a great deal
larger, for those Greenville alumni cer
tainly know how to boost anything from
Davidson, and they were working fot
the Glee Club is all right. ft would be
hard to find a man who would work
harder for anything than Fred W. Gra:
ham, chairman of the publicity commit-
tee of the Greenville Alumni Associa-
tion, did to advertise the concert and to
have the members of the Glee Club en-
tertained. If the Greenville Association
is a sample of Davidson Alumni Asso
ciations all over the South, Davidson
may truly boast of having. the most loyal
alumni in the world.

Tuesday night the musical men bask-
ed in the smiles of the fair damsels of
Brenau College, and responded with en-
cores to their van lause and the cheers of.
the Riverside Military Academy Cadets.
And for an hour or so after the concert,
as at Greenville and Winthrop. they put
in their time in conversation and repartee
with their fair hostesses. The next
morning, after a narrow escape (for
particulars ask Jamie Fowle and Coach
Tohnston) they boarded the train’ for
Toccoa. where “Puss” Graves had
things in readiness for another concert
that night.

‘The afternoon was spent in joy rid-
ing about the country and in getting ex-
tra shines (some one had to get out and
push every mile or so}; then came sup-
per, as it did everywhere. The only
trouble with these tantalizing suppers
was, they say, thar they were afraid to
eat them for ‘fear of spoiling their melod-
ious voices. The concert was a grand
success, and the reception at the Graves
home after it, too. Ask Lavens ‘Thomas
about his ancestry. “UVhe farewell the
next morning was touching, but the boys
finally tore themselves loose and board-
ed No. 12 for Easley.

When they reached Easley there was
wailing on the part of some, for they had
spent their two-bits for dinner at Cen-
tral, and here their hostesses had pro-
vided bountifully for the inner man
again, and they were already full.

“Ham” Hamilton, former trombonist in
the Orchestra, plaved i in the concert that
night. A special train from Pickens
was made up for the occasion. During
the concert it was announced by Man-

ager McIlwaine that in response to a
special request the Orchestra would sing
again; this was hastily corrected to the
Glee Club, and then the Quartet march-
ed out and sang. A delightful reception
was given after the concert by Miss
Hagood and Miss Smith.

The next afternoon found most of the
members of the concert party on No. 12
hound for Davidson. The cusomary in-
itiatorv rites for the new members were
carried out in the private car specially
provided by the Southern Railway for
the Glee Club. As the train reached
Charlotte; Conductor Jim Rowland

ame in and told the Glee Club that in
all of the thirty vears which he had spent
as a conductor, he had never seen such
a gentlemanly crowd of voung men, and
complimented the Glee Club upon their
behaviour. He repeated this statement
to his brother Captain Tom Rowland.
known to all Davidson men, who again
detailed it to the Glee Club on the
Charlotte-Davidson special.

On the whole, this was one of the

smoothly now, and doing

best trips ever taken by the Orchestr:
and Glee Club, and the reputation o
Davidson has been strengthened by it
All who took the trip were very mucl
delighted with the hospitality shown
them in each place.

GYM ‘TEAM EXHIBIT
SATURDAY AFTERNOON

‘The Gym ‘Feam has always been :
feature at Davidson, and in the past she
has had not a few teams of which she
could proudly boast. “he Gym “Veam
this sear promises to develop into a vers
good one.

The team is composed of ten men, five
of whom are new men. ‘The old mer
are: Gilchrist (715), McKeithan (717).
Price (117), UVhacker (15), and Wine

(15); and the new men are: Bennett
(16), Hawkins (18). Fones, J. Kk
(17), Porter ('t7), and Young C 17).

The new men are showing daily im
provement and will make good gymnasts.
The Gym Team will give an exhibit-
ion Saturday at gp. in., in Shearer Fall
This is alwavs a very enjoyable feature
of Junior Speaking. ‘The following
program will probably be given:

Semi-circle Pyramid, Horse, Elephant
Parallels, Pyramids, Tumbling, Diving.
Spring-board, Squash Pyramid.

Despite the fact that the team is great-
ly handicapped by poor apparatus, or the
utter lack of apparatus, all may be sure
that it will do its best to give a good
exhibition and repay the audience for
attending.

The team ‘is planning to take a trip

to Greenville, 8. C., in the near future.

It will give an exhibit there and possibly
in some other places along the way. But
no definite plans have been made.

DR. MARTIN ATTENDS
DALLAS CONVENTION

Immediately following the adjourn-
ment of the Laymen’s Convention at
Charlotte, President Martin left — for
Dallas, Tex., to be present and to take
part in the program of the Laymen’s
Convention for the western part of the
Southern General Assembly which con-
vened in that city on Febrary 23 for a
three days, session; On Sunday, Feb-
ruary 2t, he occupied the pulpit of the
First Preshyterian church of Dallas.
Dr. Martin's message to the Dallas
Convention was “Our Increased Re-
sponsibility,” the subject which he so
forcibly presented at the Charlotte Con.
vention. The latter part of last week
and the early part of this week he spent
in New Orleans, meeting the Davidson
alumni of that city. He will return home
the latter part of this week.

According to newspaper accounts, the
Dallas Convention was as momentous
and as inspiring as the Charlotte Con-
vention. The meetings were held in the
First Presbyterian church, of which Rev.
W. M. Anderson, D.D., is pastor, and
which will seat about 3,000 people. An-
proximately 1,000 delegates were enroll-
ed on the first day. Such leaders as
Dobyns, Innes. Ellis, Shane and White

took part in the program.

MISSION STUDY
NINETY PER CENT.

The mission study classes are running
fine work.
The average attendance of all classes so
far has been about go per cent. The
effeet_ of the Laymen’s Missionary Con-
vention, in Charlotte, has given a new
spirit and stimulus to the study of mis-
sions, and the Davidson men are realiz-
ing now, more than ever, the supreme
importance of missions in the Christian
ife.
