THE DAVIDSONIAN,

FEBRUARY 7, 1934

Eumenean Society

Elects Officers

Richard Banks, president, J. M.
Douglas, vice-president, J. H. Ross,
secretary, and Ed Humphrey, critic,
were elected to head the Eumenean
Literary Society for the next term at
its meeting during the past week.
These officers will be placed in office
at the next meeting.

At its regular meeting Tuesday, Feb-
ruary 6, the society debated the ques-
tion, Resolved: That the United States
Should Substantially Increase the
Power of Its Armed Forces. J. A. C.
Andrews and E. S. Finley argued af-
firmatively with G. B. Squires and
Jack Branch debating negatively.

That the growth in military power
of Germany, Japan and Russia neces-
sitated an increase in U, S. military
power was the principal argument of
the affirmative. In refutation of this,
the negative emphasized that the geo-
graphical location of the United States
made the country secure enough, that
3,000 miles of water was the country’s
war insurance.

McCallie Brings Strong
Team Against ’Kittens

Saturday night the McCallie School
basketball team will be engaged in the
local gymnasium by the Davidson
freshman quintet. This prep school
five last year won the Mid-South As-
sociation championship.

McCallie comes to the campus with
one of the best groups of basketeers
in any southern preparatory school. In
1933, the same five that will be seen

here Saturday won the tournament
conducted in Nashville, Tenn., each

year by The Nashville Banner to de-
termine the championship of the Mid-
South Association of Prep Schools.
This season they hope to repeat when
the tournament is held in the Tennes-
see metropolis in March.

So far this season the team has won
12 out 16 games, with Captain
Fletcher Sims being on the sidelines
during three of these defeats, suffer-
ing with an injured leg.

Captain Sims, however, is back in
the line-up now, and will no doubt
be on hand when the Wildkittens take

the '33 gridmen, who went through
an undefeated season.
