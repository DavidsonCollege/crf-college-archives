A REVIEW .

Some’ boeks that show

ary to a visual art form
have provided us with our.
most exciting and terful
cinematic moments,

ler’s novel is located on the
Mediterranean island of Pi-
anosa, occupied by Ameri-
can troops during ‘World
War II.

The movie, like the book,
is a composite of shots, of
individual incidents, employ-
ing the frequent use of
flashbacks. ‘Continuity is
supplied through the central
figure of Yossarian.

The scriptwriter, Buck
Henry, whose credits _ in-
clude similar chores for
“The Graduate,’’ has zeroed
in on the same wave-length
as Heller.. His re-write for
the screen has captured the
same manic, frenzied pulse
that characterized the novel.

He is adept at exposing
raw “nerves while maintain-
ing a facade of black come-
dy.

The uniformly competent
acting suffers from the
butchery of film editing.

Working to enhance the
‘student life at Davidson, the
chairmen of the groups mak-
ing school social policy an-
swered their critics Tuesday
by explaining ‘heir goals
and—priorities and giving
their plans for “big week-
ends’’ and the other week-
‘ends of the year.

(Miany of those critical of
the current’ social plans
have said that the $40,000 in
the Union budget. for enter-
tainment should be spread
out more throughout the
whole year, according to
Weldon Schenck, president
of the Social Council.

“What we are doing on the
off weekends is exactly pa-
rallel to what many of these
people have suggested.

‘We figured that just se-
veral big weekends was not
enough, and that centraliz-
ing on those weekend left
much of the year blank,”
commented : Stuart Shelton,
chairman of the Union
Board.

“‘Therefore, we have—been
trying to bring, inexpensive
but not cheap entertainment
on off weekends, and to
spread out the  entertain-
ment.”’

“So far this year,’ said
Schenck, ‘‘We have had the
Josh White Jr., concert, two
all-campus dances the first

Alan Arkin as Yossarian.
*““Catch-22"" should  defini-
tively establish Arkin as
The Great American Actor.
Yossarian is not an easy
role to fill.

‘His. moods range from
manic depression to frenzi-
ed. ‘terror, while constantiy
maintaining an underlying
wisdom. Arkin accomplishes
all with ease and natural-
ness,

The real magician of the
whole production is director
Mike Nichols. With care-
ful consideration of all the
elements—the mood of Hel-
ler’s original, the chronology
of events, the capabilities of
Arkin and his  co-star—he
has whipped up’ a treat for
the eye and a challenge for
the mind.

From the opening frames
of the sun rising. over the

, austere mountains of Piano-

sa, throughout the length of
the film, to the closing shot
of Yossarian paddling to-
ward Sweden, Nichols did

not once lose sight. of his

objective.

nique as he has rejected

“These programs are
especially important in the
fall term when the fresh-
men, who are not members

of fraternities, are looking
for things to do.
Future plans include

“Your Fathers’ Mustache,”
“Brewer and Shipley,’ and
possibly some experiments,

such as a country and folk”

“We don't. want Davidson

, to be known for three week-

ends, but for’a sound social
system,"’ Shelton said.
Schenck expressed at-
tempts ‘Not to cater to any
one group. The attempt is
being made to plan a con-
tinual social program, not
just a sporadic one based on

“just several weekénds.”’

‘My problem now is -find-
ing enough weekends," said
Shelton.

One problem, he stated, is
that the college cannot pro-
ject as far into the future as
pther schoofs can because of
the limited budget.

Schenck and Shelton
brought up the claims by
some people that the big
weekends were ‘‘too big.’”’

“Big weekends allow the
people that can't get away
a chance for a good social

the basic symbolism (I’m
thinking here of the repeat-
ed scenes of Snowden’s
death) require .a° greater
elucidation than Nichols was
willing to give.

*““Cattch-22"’ is anti-war. The
real theme lies in question-
ing the panic of being alive.

Unfortunately comparisons
with ‘‘M.A.S.H."" are going
to be inevitable. But this
would be like comparing
“Richard II’ to ‘No Time
for Sergeants.”’

“Catch-22"" is an achieve-
ment of originality, depth,
and style. It misses perfec-
tion by a long shot. But it
indulges ~in some of the
finest moments on film we
have’ been exposed to in a

program,’ of said Shelton.
Some criticism as been
leveled at them for such
big productions as _ last
year’s Spring Frolics, ac-
cording te Schenck.
“Spring Frolics was as

much a _ product of itast
year’s Council as _— this
year’s,” he answered, “but

we felt that the big name
that. Chicago” had would
bring a lot of people. on
campus, so we wanted some-
thing going on at alt times.
We don’t plan anything as
big as last year’s Spring
Frolics this year.”

Answering attacks
the money spent on
dink’ acts at this Home-
coming could have been
spent more profitably  else-
where, he added: ‘As far
as finances go, Bill Spooner
did his card tricks in the
Bar for free.

‘‘None of the Union funds
went for, his performance.”
‘Poet Diane Wakowski also
performed at no cost.

“And then there were the
skydivers,” he went on. “‘I
thought they were a great
hit, and they only cost us
$175. Out of a budget of

that
“rinky-

$40,000, that isn’t much.

“Steve Baron played Sun-
day morning, and cost us
$1.50. During his whole per-
formance, the crowd varied
from: 50 to 200 people, and
I'm sure there was some
turnover in the crowd, so
‘actually more people than
that probably saw him.”

About such acts as Spoon-
er and the skydivers,. Shel-
ton said, ‘“What we had hop-
.ed to do is add the low pres-

_ Sure entertainment to the
big weekends."’

“What we want -is not
just passive entertainment—
we want fo try to lef them
(the student body) have a
good time,’’ said Schenck.

On the work of the Union
‘Board and Social Council,
College Union Director C.
Shaw Smith commented,
“What they've tried to do is
sharpen their knowledge of
groups and acts to be able
to spread enough variety on
these weekends so that peo-
ple can be selective. Every-
body’s not*supposed to do
everything, and it's a relief
to _have__some—silly—little
things, plus big acts, and all
kinds of entertainment.
