MYERS

I walked with a confident air up to the coach's office door.
My confident swagger was due to the fact that I was confident:
I know the solution to Davidson's number one problem.

Here was I, about to cross a
threshold that had made strong
hearts weak, weak hearts weaker,
and weaker hearts stop. Yet I was
cool as a cool cucumber, my hand
ready as a stock. I gloated a few
moment over my powerful position,
then knocked,

As the eye-slot in the steel door
slid back, the smell of burning
flesh greeted my nostrils. Three
beady eyes peered out.

“Go away, Buster, the coach is
in mourning.”

“My good fellow,” I began while
aimlessly polishing my nails on my
lapel, ‘it so happens I know how
Davidson can win some football

ga—”

1 was before the coach. He was
looking at me through the loop in
his combination riding crop-buil
whip. I laughingly thought to my-
self that his first words would be
“take ten laps around the field.”

“Take ten Japs around the field,”
the coach recited.

“But sir,” 1 said, “I’m not a
player. But I can Welp you win
football games.”

He put down the thumb-screw he
was playing with. I took this for
a sign of encouragement and went
on,

“As you know we've lost some
tough games this year. Lately ‘we
haven't even won a moral victory.
My plan calls for us to concentrate
on immoral victories.”

With this the coach put down
the doodling he was doing with a
seapel on a human maniken, “Go
on.”

I then warmed up to my subject.
I went over the plan step by step,
detail by detail. I brought out all
the strong points, the reason it
couldn't fail, everything. In a half
hour 1 finished, perspiring and
tired.

“Won't work,” was the only com-
ment.

Religion Poses
Difficulty At

Harvard Univ.

Cambridge, Mass. (1.P.)-——Har-
vard College's curriculum does not
present. religion as effectively or
comprehensively as it might. ac-
cording to Dean Willard L. Sperry,
head of the Harvard University
Divinity School.

“Jt is unfortunate,” Dean Sperry
declared, “that some students come
to College unaware of religion and
leave without being awakened.”

Any man who brings an interest
in religion to Harvard, he said “will
have opportunities to mature that
interest.” But he added that a stu-
dent will have to hunt for his re-
ligious instruction and inspiration,
for they will not be handed to him.

According to Dean Sperry, it
has been difficult for the faculty
to agree on a definite program of
religious instruction. He said he
believes that a course on the de-
velopment of religion in America
would be of value. Some considera-
tion has been given to a General
Education course on religion.

my trump card and thereupon went
into a plea that would have made
William Jennings Bryan seem a
mute and Desmosthenes a high-
schoo! valedictorian, Strangers had
gathered‘ around us and were weep-
ing openly before I finished.

Coach wiped his eyes on a
shroud. At last he managed. “it
might work at that. Pi try it in
the Georgia Tech game for obvious
reasons. You're a genius. Davidson

works we'll beat Tech 42-6. Only

out around. these Korean hills,” he
added.

The Goldenrod, Wayne State
Teachers College, Nebraska, is a
bit fed up with certain types, of

male dancers. Here are the types:

Harry the Hepcat—-"“He asks a
girl to dance as if he were Louis
B. Mayer asking a starlet to star
in a million dollar picture extra-
vaganza. While twirling his part-
ner back and forth like a yo-yo,
he is constantly speaking in a line
of jive jargon...”

Bashiul Bill—‘Bill feels terribly
embatassed and the only excuse he
can think of is that he just washed
his feet and can't do a thing with
them...”

Luke the Lover—“He says he
used to be conceited but went to
a psychiatrist and was cured. Now
he is the nicest guy he ever met.
If someone doesn't wise up to this
character, he is liable to love him-
self to death...”

Ballard Reports

Davidson leads all other divisions
of the Mecklenburg Red Feather
Drive in the percentage of quota
obtained,. Col. Ballard. division
chairman, reported today.

With a total of $1950 through
Thursday noon, the locat drive is
well on its way toward going over
the top. Col. Ballard reported that
several solicitors, as well as eight
of the fraternities, have not been
heard from, and these additions
should increase the total to over
$2250. The sum already collected
more. than doubles last year’s con-
tributions, Col. Ballard said.

Salem Provides
Halloween Fun

This weekend fifty-five Davidson
students will go to Salem for a
weekend of Halloween merriment.
They will leave here by bus at
ore o'clock Saturday and plan to

arrive at Salem at three, from here

they will be taken by truck to a
camp outside Salem for square
dancing and supper. At seven
o'clock they will return to Salem
for more dancing and a floor show.
We couldn't find out just where
the dates for these adventurous
young lads were coming from, but
as always with Davidson men fe-
males are females regardless of
where they come from.

All this is being sporsored by
the YWCA of Salem and is being
co-ordinated here at Davidson by
Bill Buckey, who is in charge of
social activities for the Davidson

The Bars Are Down

“Once you let down the bars on
a thing like this, there is no way
of telling where it may lead,” ob-

revealed that advice against such
a move had been given the gov-

“He personally was delegated to
relay the dissenting sympathies of
the Southern Presbyterian Church

jointed Myron Taylor his advisor
to the Vatican during World War
