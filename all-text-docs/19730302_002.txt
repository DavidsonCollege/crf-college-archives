P.E. Requirements Remain Unfulfilled

By JIM PAULSEN
Contributing Editor
According to the Director of
Physical Education Chip Stone.
160 juniors and two seniors have
not fulfilled their P-.E.
requirements.

Under the present program,
students are required ‘‘to
demonstrate or attain”
proficiency in four individual
and one team sport.

Students who have not met
their proficiency requirements
by junior year are required to
participate regularly in a P.E.
program.

“From what I understand,
when the program was set up
the students were given a year's
grace period before they would
be required to attend class for
not fulfilling their
requirement."’ Stone said.

Approximately 12 students
used this grace period to pass
their requirements.

“I am in the process of
working up a letter to send to
those other juniors, to tell them
they are required to attend
class and pass five proficiency
tests in order to graduate.”’ he
stated.

Some students expressed
dissatisfaction with the present
guidelines required for passing
a proficiency test or attending
classes with 4 limited number
of cuts.” said Blain Butner.

Concurring with this opinion.
John White felt that generally
not many people fail a P.E.
course. “However, if a student
goes to all the classes and really
tries, he ought to be passed.”
said White.

One student who has not com-
pleted any of his P.E.
requirements said, ‘I am not
trying to get out of it, but since |
have been at Davidson, I really
haven't had time.”

Stone felt that no major
changes in the P.E. program or
requirements are con-
templated.

‘‘We do plan to add some new
programs and find things that
will interest a lot of people, so
that physical education can be
enjoyed by the students.

“Qne change will be that
classes will be offered at several

times in the future. including al
night,”’ Stone indicated.

Stone pointed out that the per-
centage of participation by the
female students has been
higher than that of the males.

Eight girls have participated
in the Fall program and 14 girls
are involved in Winter term
classes.

‘Coed classes seem to be well
liked by both girls and guys. It
has worked out well and has in-
creased participation,’ he said.

At present the gym facilities

for women, especially locker
room space. are limited, ac-
cording to several girls who
participate inthe P.E. program.

“They need to think about
facilities for women, before
they even consider adding to the
program offerings. I hope they
keep classes coed and improve
the women's locker room
facilities,’ said Mary Turner.

‘*We must work on increasing
facilities for girls and trying to
develop classes that will in-
terest them,” said Stone.

SLC To Establish
Visitation Program

By HUGH MOORE
Contributing Editor

The Student Life Committee
will set up a regular program
of faculty-student visitations in
late March.

This program will parallel
one which existed in earlier
years at Davidson. Students
will be given the opportunity to
visit faculty s homes on Sunday
nights.

Of course participation by
both faculty and students will
be voluntary.

The visitation program will
be promoted by an ad hoc com-
mittee of the student Senate.
which SGA President Bo
Phillips plans for the beginning
of the spring term.

Phillips was recently asked
by Vice President for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan to con-
sider the possibility of creating

“an office for Student, Admin-
istration. Faculty Relations’
in the student government.

“I haven't had a chance to
talk to Dr. Bevan about the of-
fice. Until I know what that
idea means I do not want to
comment on it,"’ Phillips said.

But Phillips did say that he
did not want to see a committee
or office on student-faculty
relations become a permanent

goes back to the idea of coer-

with faculty,’ he explained.

“The committee's purpose
should be to create a flow of

be popular to say so, but the

Senate Shelves Service Plan,
Rugby Club Receives $150

By HARRIETT HODGES
News Editor

A motion to establish a
Student Information Service to
keep students informed about
Senate activities was shelved
in the student Senate this week.

Vince Rabil, who introduced
the motion, said that he viewed
the service as a means of get-
ting information to the students
so they would know who to see
about enacting changes they
wanted.

“There is a great deal of in-
formation that needs to be sent
out to people,’ Rabil said.

The service would probably
take the form of a newsletter
sent to all students. according
to Rabil.

Although a majority of the
senators present voted in favor
of the service. the motion failed
because of abstentions from two
senators.

Bob Edmunds, one of the two
who abstained, said he was in
favor of the Student Information
Service, but saw no need to
create a new committee to run
the service.

In other business, the Senate
heard a report on the Black
Student Coalition (BSC) by its
president, Steve Peck.

“Students should really get
behind the Black Student
Coalition and its efforts because
they have gained many things
for students,’ Peck said.

Wne example of something
the BSC has gained for students
is the chance to study abroad
with schools other than David-
son, according to Peck.

Other actions in Monday
night's meeting included a
decision to give $150 to the
Rugby Club.

Also, the Senate voted to
create ad hoc committees on
Governance and Co-Education
to be chaired by Senators Blain
Butner and Sue Schmidt.
respectively.

In another vote. the Senate

decided to require the Gover-
nance Committee to bring
proposals to the Senate before
presentation to the Board of
Trustees.

Also, an amendment to the
by-laws was passed which will
require that the chairman of the
Elections Council be selected
from among senior members of
the Senate.

In another vote. George Pin-
dar and Steve Smith were ap-
pointed to seats on the Campus
Tax Council. .

Also, the Senate heard a
report from Vince Rabil on the

meeting of the Student Conduct
Council.

The meeting was primarily
concerned with the problem of
stolen books in the library, ac-
cording to Rabil.

“The council goes along with
the idea of having students from
APO and the Honor Court go
from room to room to explain
the problem of missing books. ©
Rabil said.

The opinion of the council, ac-
cording to Rabil. is that while
taking books is against the code
of responsibility, it is not con-
sidered an honor violation.

STAIRWAY TO THE SKY

A ladder through an opening in a roof provokes curiosity as to
where it leads—to the stars, to the clouds, to nowhere—and pre-

exam daydreaming begins.
