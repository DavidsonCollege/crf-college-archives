THE DAVIDSONIAN

By Bratton HoLmes
Sports Editor

Co-Most Valuable

Jamilah Sawyer

Entering the outdoor track season, Sawyer
was the only person on the roster who had karned
All-Conference honors in an individual event
last year. She was named All-Conference in the
100m hurdles as well as the 4x100m relay.

So what could she do to help the team this
year? Repeat.

Sawyer was the only member of the women’s
team to be named AllConference at the Southern
Conference Championships this season. She
earned the honor with her second place finish in
the 100m hurdles in 15 seconds flat.

Sawyer is a good sprinter and excels in
hurdles. Her season best time in-the 100m
hurdles of :14.87 was also the team’s season best
time and was only less than two-tenths of a
second off of the school record which she set
herself last season.

She also posted the best time by a Wildcat
this season in the 400m hurdles and the second
best in the 400m.

This season she ran the 400m leg of the
Distance Medley Relay team broke the old school
record by: almost six seconds. In the 4x400m
relay, she ran on three teams that came within
three seconds of the school record.

Co-Most Valuable
Smyth Bitter

Arguably the most promising runner to grace
the women’s track roster in years, Bitter has had
an enormous inipact during her rookie season.

posted the team’s best performances of the season
in three different events and broke the school
record in two of them.

Both the 400m record and the 800m record
fell with Bitter’s arrival on the Davidson track
scene. Her other team-best time was in the 1500m.
In that event, her time of 4:46.17 was under six
seconds off of the record. It seems more than
probable that she will break that record as well
before she leaves Davidson.

Along with Sawyer, Bitter carried the relay
teams throughout the season. In the 4x400, she ran
in the team’s four best performances this season,
three of which were within seconds of the school
record. She also ran the 1600m leg of the record-
setting DMR team this season.

- Atthe Southern Conference Championships,
Bitter claimed fifth place in the 400m, making her
and Sawyer the only Wildcat runners to place in
the top six in individual events.

Best Rookie

Jill Neumayer
Another rookie mid-distance runner,
Neumayer was routinely the number two finisher
after Bitter in the 800m and 1500m events. Her
season-best time in the 800m was 2:21.71. This

- was three seconds behind Bitter’s record-breaking

season best and was .6 seconds off of the old
school record in the 800m.

Neumayer placed ninth in the 1500m with a
season-best time of 4:57.62, making her the sec-
ond fastest Davidson runner in the 1500m this
season. :

She was a critical member of the relay teams
as well. She ran on teams that posted three of the
top four finishes this season in the 4x400m, in-
cluding one that placed fifth at the Southern Con-
