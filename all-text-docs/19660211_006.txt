The Davidson fraternity pres-
idents voted at a meeting Sun-
day to express their objections
‘to two parts of the recommenda:
tions made last week by the So-
cial Life Evaluation Committee.

The second of the committee's
seven recommendations was. that
the freshman class be required
to eat in the Union both semes-
ters. One reason for this, the
report stated, was to help main-
tain a superior level of food
service. The fraternity presi-
dents were opposed to this gen-
erally for several reasons.

ASSOCIATION

“The objection to this recom-.
mendation."’ stated Frank Gib-
bes, Pi Kappa Phi president;
“was based on the belief that the

freshmen have an opportunity:

for a valuable association wth
upperclassmen, and seniors es-
pecially. I think it is necessary
for a proper integration into col-
lege. life at Davidson.”

This was the major concern
of the presidents in objecting to
this lack of exposure to upper-
classmen. They also felt that-it
would be a barrier to fraternity
unity. ‘The report seems in-
consisterit at this point in re-
moving all artificial barriers be-
tween upperclassmen and fresh-
men by recommending basically
unrestricted rush (recommenda-
tion four) and then placing this
very binding limitation on the
fratecnities,”" said Billy Clark,
president of Kappa Sigma.

CONTACT |

“It may be sort of selfish. but
I would miss the contact with the
pledges, and I don’t believe that
it is too trite to say that the
freshmen would benefit from
more contact with the seniors,”
Clark added.

The increased finaricial. bur-
den on fraternities by having no
pledges eating second semester
was mentioned, but it was gen-
erally felt that this) problem
could be worked ou‘ if it be-
came nécessary.

BURDEN

“The college is placing a bur-
‘den on the fra.ernities in order
to inake its (the college's) job
easier.”” said Jim Martin, Pi
Kappa Alpha president. ‘The
fraternities have financial prob-
lems in maintaining a superior
level of food service as well as
the college does.”

The basic problem found in the
committee’s recommendation to
have rush second semester was
the increased burden placed on
the upperclassmen and fresh-

COLISEUM SEATING

The shaded areas on this diagram of the Charlotte Coliseum indicate the areas reserved for student seating. The Athfetic De-
partment reserves approximately 900 seats in one circle section, two mezzanine sections and three middte balcony sections,
Athletic Director Tom Scott told THE DAVIDSONIAN. “We hold some extras in case the students want more,” he said. Ticket
prices range from three doltars In the circle to two dollars in the middle balcony; students get the tickets at half-price.

men. It was agreed that the
most preferable time for rush
was during orientation period
before classes started.

INFORMAL RUSH

“Dealing from the upperclass-
men's standpoint,” Clark said.
“there is always a period of
heightened activity in informal
rush for several weeks preced-
ing the formal period of rush. If
rush was at the first of the sec-
ond semester, the increased in-
formal rush would fall duning
exams.”

IFC President Jim Terry said
that he thought pre-school rush
would work out. very well. The
freshman could be an affiliate
first, semester arid then pledg-
ing could take place second se-
mester. The main thing is to get
rush over with as soon as pos-
sible.’ Terry added.

TOTAL OPPORTUNITY

The reaction of the fraternity
presidents toward the total op-
portunity bidding system pro-
posed by the committee was gen-
erally one of opposition, but the
recommendation was not formal-
dy opposed as the presidents felt
that this change was inevitable.
Clark's reaction to this séction
and-to the report in general was
that it was ‘‘probably a reflec-
tion of the spirit of the times,
what's blowin’ in the wind.”

‘The recommendation was
amended by the faculty com-
mittee from that which was
printed last week in THE DAV-
IDSONTAN.

CHANGE .

The. first. sentence of Recom-
mendation Five now reads,
“That the Interfraternity Council
submit to the Faculty Committee
on, Fraternities. Clubs. and So-
celal Life by March 1, 1967, a
workab'e plan whereby every
freshman so desiring be given
opportunity for affiliation with a
fraternity (the range of .affilia.
tion to;be considered shall be
from. what_is now meant -by ‘so-
cial affiliate’ to what is now
meant by ‘member’ or ‘broth-
er’)"*,

This- part previously read,
“That the Interfraternity Coun-
cil submit. to the Faculty Com.
mittee’ on Fraternities. Clubs
and Socia! Life by March 1},
1967, a workable plan whereby
every freshman desiring a bid
gets one.”

sonally opposed to any form of

Mrs. Nicholls Plans
Reservation Changes

This year upperclassmen will
be ab’e to reserve their pres-
ent rooms up until the general
drawings for new rooms. instead
of baing required to decide be-
fore the drawing whether to
keep thelr present room.

Mrs. Peter Nicholi3, super-
visor of Dormitories, stated that
this would probably be the only
change from last year’s system.
The procedure consists of draw-
ing numbers from a bow! to de-
termine in what order room
choices will be made. Rising
seniors will get first pick, and:
so on down through the three
classes, ’

Last year there were several
complaints of sophomores mov-
ing in with seniors in desirable

to reserve the room for the fol-
lowing year.

Most of the complaints con-
cerned Duke Dormitory. How-
ever, Mrs. Nicholls reported
that this year no sophomores or

juniors have moved into Duke|

since September.

Concerning another problem
of last year, she vowed, ‘‘Mrs.
Gillespie and I will exercise all
vigilance so that nobody draws
more than once. But a lot de-
pends on the integrity of the
students." She mentioned the
possibility of a punchboard to
replace the present system of

system as we have it now. Real-
istically, however, there is no
way around it. We must go
into this thing with a positive at-

satisfied’ with the first publi-
cation of The Misceltany last
December.

Vick also stated that the mag-

throughout the campus, espe-
cially by the faculty.

To some students’ objections
to a lack of student entries, Vick
replied that there were few
student| contributions. He stress-

Mary's Features Food,

Atmosphere, Reading

By JOE SAUNDERS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“Hey, let's go down to
Mary's.”

This oft-heard expression. re-
fers to Mary’s, (or the M and M
Soda Shop to the out-crowd),
one of the most popular places
in Davidson, and not just be-
cause it's one of the few soda
shops in the town.

Mary’s-has a certain atmos-
phere all its own — formed from
such diverse elements as pert-
petual WBT radio commercials,
stacks of magazines ranging
from True Confession to Bronze
Thrill, and of course, the shop's
famous egg-salad sandwiches.
Although not the prototype of a
small-town beanery, it meets
the demands of the most part-
icular Davidson student.

As nearly everyone knows,
Mary's is run by Mrs. Mary
Potts and Murray Fleming. part-
ners in the enterprse for over 16
years.

They do a thriving business in
all sorts of foods and sundries,
but strangely enough, the M and
M Soda Shop doesn’t sell sodas.
Their specialty, egg salad sand-
wiches, “is followed by chicken
salad. cream cheese and olive
sandwiches,” says Murray caus-
tically, as he pops two grilled-
cheese sandwiches into the toast-
er.

During chapel period: Wednes-
day and Friday and on Satur-
day night, the shop is iull of stu-
dents who. squeeze into one of
the six booths to talk or read the
magazines, ignoring the sign

problems arise again this year.
A sheet with the details con-
cerning room selection will be

rooms at the last minute in order distributed the week of Feb. 21.

MURRAY FASHIONS A MASTERPIECE
Famed Egg-Salad Sandwich

which forbodingly warns: ‘For |

Sale Only.”

Asked why the sign wasn't re-
moved, since no attention was
paid to it, Murray only sighs and
replies: ‘“‘Everybody would ask

why we took it down."’ as he *

reaches for the mayonnaise.
The shop. open from 8 a.m. un-
tl '5 p.m. on weekdays and until
9 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday,
depends on students for about 80
per cent of its business, but the
shop serves as a_ convenient
meeting place between students

‘and townpeople.

Mary and Murray have implic-
it trust in all students: They
merely ask a customer what he
had when he’s ready to pay, and
they never refuse to cash a stu-
dent’s check.

Many students have ahwvays
wondered what goes on behind
the partition in.the middle of the
room. Mary slyly admitted that
it serves as a second room for
two students, Jim and Conrad
Martin.

“**As employes emeritus. we
give them the run of the place,”
Mary quipped.

The occasional complaint. of
slow service during rush. hours
brings a dry “I do my best"
from Murray, as he mechanical-
ly continues slapping chicken
salad between two slices of toast,
never losing his composure in
the meantime.

Students may come and go:
Davidson may expand 10 times
over, of it may fold up forever,
but there will

Holbrook's impersonation. of
Mark Twain is said to be as ac-
curate as indefatigable research
can make it. Every word that
he speaks on stage is Twain's.
Every gesture is genuine, ac-

of people who knew the cele-

of his lectures.

During the course of each eve-

proceeds from the *‘humorous-

selections from  Wuckleberry
