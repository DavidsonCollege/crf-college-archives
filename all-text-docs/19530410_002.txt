Entered as second class matter at the Post Office at Davidson,
N. C., under the Act of March 3, 1897.

Union Post Office Question
Depends On Student Interest

Last fall the Davidsonian printed an editorial inquiring
what provisions had been made for placing a post office in
the College Union. This information was requested as a result
of the apparent interest on the part of many students who
sincerely wanted a post office established in the Union. Acting
upon student interest, a detailed study of the possibilities of
this service was made by the administration. It was thought,
however, that final approval should come from the
student body to show that the greater majority of the
students were in favor of the proposal. A vote was taken at
the various fraternity meetings resulting in six favoring and
five opposing the idea.

We do not believe that this was a valid count not only
because it was taken in the heat of the freshmen eating con-
troversy, but, also, due to the fact that most men were not
sufficiently informed about the matter. It is our desire in
this editorial to enumerate briefly several facts as they per-
tain to the student body and we recommend that a vote be
taken at the earliest possible date in order to arrive at a more
valid and representative decision.

Mr. Martin, in a recent letter to Dr. Cunningham has
pointed out several reasons why a post office in the Union
would particularly benefit the students.

Convenience

_ It would reduce to a large extent the amount of
time required each day for the necessary trips to and
from the town post office. If the mail service were in-
corporated in the Union, it would be on a direct
route from the dormitories to the fraternity or board
ing houses. Students hving in the village or in town
might have to walk farther for their mail, but
chances are they would be on the campus when
mail was delivered. °

Mail Service

A suitable mail service would be worked out
providing several deliveries each day. Although the
mail would have to be separated at the town post
office and then brought to the Union, there would
not be a great delay. Mail would probably be dis-
tributed during first period and would be available
at the latest by chapel in the morning. Another de-
livery would probably be made around supper.

All college and student organizational corre-
spondence as well as that for individuals would be
distributed free at the Union post office.

Finance

Boxes will be rented to the students at the flat
rate of fifty cents per semester which is somewhat
below what is now being paid at the town post office.
It is necessary that all students have a box in order
that the system function properly. Students may also
rent a box in town if they so desire.

Tentative plans would include two additional stu-
dent jobs each year to sort and distribute the mail.
This would be paid for primarily from the collection
of box rents.

Location

The post office would be located in the south-
west corner of the Union, with a direct entrance from
the south end of the building.

We believe that the student body should seriously con-
sider the advantages of a post office in the Union not only
to fill present needs but also requirements of years to come.
As the student store, the cafeteria, and better programs are
incorporated in the Union, it will become more and more a
center of student and faculty activity.

The administration has indicated that a post office could
be incorporated into the plans if the students showed suf-
ficient interest.

J. Milton.

By now most of the seniors have
filled out at least one, and prob-
ably eight or ten application blanks
for needy companies that have been
on the campus this spring. And
even those who aren't seniors have
surely signed a deferrment agree-
ment for another needy organiza-
tion, so Davidsonian readers are
not unfamiliar with the fine art
of futurity form finesse.

You know the type of applica-
tion. It’s the one they draw up
during the office Christmas party
with a space for your name and
address like this:

and like this for your, telephone
number:

But how many of us, on the other
hand, know what happens to those
forms once they have been filed
with said needy firms? I didn’t
until the other day when I stopped
by the Bell Telephone company in
Charlotte to complain about a
snippy-voiced operator who willful-
ly connected me with the Mint
Museum of Art instead of Queens
four times in a row Friday night.

It was right interesting sitting
there in the office watching the
operators playing practical jokes
on hospital and long distance calls.

But then I overheard somebody
behind a desk say something about
Davidson.

There were a couple of boys
talking, obviously employees, one
with a cigar and both with “Greens-
boro H.S.A.A.” in block letters
across their sweat shirts.

“Say Charley,” one of them ask-
ed, “looka these applications from
Davidson. Whadda we do, accept
them like usual?”

“Naw,” said Charley with the
cigar. “Boss says we gotta read
them. We just got one job, and
there’s two applications.”

No-name counted them careful-
ly. “Awright, Charley, but you bet-
ter do it out loud. You know how
I am on this reading stuff.”

As it turned out Charley wasn’t
too good on this reading stuff
either, but he muddled his way
through names, addresses and mar-
ital status, Charley looked puzzled
when he came to “Degree Re-
ceived,” under “Education.” “This
here B.S.,” he asked No-name, “‘is
that like one of them there
M.D.'s?”

“What's a M.D., Charley?”

Charley read on down to “Em-
ployment and Business Exper-
ience; Show any Bell System
work.” Charley suddenly burst out
laughing. He pushed the applica-
tion in front of No-name and point-
ed to an entry. “Looka here. Un-
der it says ‘Show any Bell System
work,’ this guy writes ‘Just press
the button.’ Y’get it? See where
he just writes ‘Press the button’?
Ain’t that a killer?”

No-name frowned, then laughed
with Charley. “Yeah, yeah, that’s
pretty good. Keep reading, Char-
ley.”

Charley came to “Faculty Opin-
ions,” slowed down, and stopped.
“Whassa matter?” asked No-name.
“Words too big for ya?”

“Naw, can’t read the writing.”
Other subtleties, too, escaped Char-
ley, not to mention No-name, in-
cluding where one applicant had
filled in “Sweetbriar” after the
question, “In which of the follow-
ing broad areas do your interests
lie?”

Having at last plowed through
both applications, Charley still had-
n’t made a choice. He turned to
No-name. “You seen the pictures
these guys sent. You got any
ideas?”

No-name assumed a judicious
air. “This first guy, he’s a square.
Y'see where he ain't got but a half-
windsor knot in his tie. This other
guy, though, he’s got a double-loop
knot — maybe even t’ree or four
loops. He’sa guy yu’wanta hire.”

This was good enough for Char-
ley, who stamped the second ap-
plication “Accepted” and threw the
first one away. He got up from
the desk and relit his cigar. ‘“‘Let’s
knock off for the day and shoot
some pool. It’s been a tough morn-
ing.”

“Okay Charley,” said No-name,
“only I don’t unnerstand , . .”

“What don’t you understand?”

“T still don't understand what he
means, ‘Just press the button.’ ”

D.C. Candidates Take Notice: Joe Has Answer

By D. H. OGDEN

The day was hot and dry and I|I ask just what that is, and why

was sitting in goomis's having my
ysual noon-hour lemonade and
chatting with Max, who was indo-
lently wiping off several glasses.

“Who do ya’ reckon owns th’
blue Cadi parked outside?” he
asked.

“Darned if I...”

“Hey, two whiskey sours — and
make it snappy,” a voice at a few
seats down from me spoke wp.

“Right...”

I saw but one fellow sitting there.
When Max brought the sours, the
fellow guiped his down and then
turned and poured the second into
something on his left. I looked
more closely and saw what ap-
peared to be some sort of metal
machine sitting on the stool next
to the stranger.

“Two more,” he ordered, where-
upon the machine shook a bit and
a light glowed on its top. “All right,
give him a side car,” our new com-
panion mumbled. He again drank
the sour and then poured the side

light glowed a second time, but a
little dimmer.

I could not withhold my curios-
ity any longer, so I rose and went
over and seated myself next to the
stranger. “Pardon me,” I inter-

Hee are pouring those drinks into
The small, sallow-complexioned,
man replied that that was Joe, and
that it was celebrating another vic-
tory. He then drank about half of
his old-fashioned and turned and
looked at me. I could see that he
would become more talkative with
plying, so I inquired furthur:

“Well — ah — what sort of vic-
tory did Joe just win?”

“It swept an election on the sec-
ond ballot not half an hour ago.
It’s sorta’ tired and wants to loosen
up a bit.” The light still glowed
on the machine, but was becoming
fainter with each drink. “I think
it wants to get a little drunk right
now.”

With a man pouring drinks down
a machine next to me, I could be-
lieve almost anything, so I persist-
ed. “That’s pretty good, but
how...”

“I know; you want to know how
Joe won the election. Everybody
wants to know how Joe won. Well,
Ill tell you how. It’s a professional
election winner...”

I ordered another lemonade.

to win an election, is hire Joe,

walked around in order to get a
closer look at Joe. At a more care-
ful inspection, the thing did have
a general appearance of being ro-
botish. Suddenly one of the things
which resembled an arm, flopped
loosely at its side. “Better slow
down — you're gettin’ looped,”
grumbled the man to the machine.

“What is this hinged door for?”
I asked, examining the piece ot
metal a little more closely.

“There is an extra hand in there
which Joe uses for shaking peo-
ples hands. See his arms?” I nod-
ded dubiously. “One has a fist
attached for pounding desks; the
other contains an extra heavy
spring for back-slapping.”

“Good idea — what's this?” I
urged him on, pointing to what
looked like a pair of white upper
and lower plates.

“That, buddy, is Joe’s big smilc
which he must wear at all times
when running for any kind of of-
fice.” He poured another old-fash-
ioned into the election - winning
machine, which shook again rather
feebly, and continued. “See these
records? He has a speech for every
kind of occasion and for every
group hidden right in this com-
partment. He can talk to the coun-
try boys or the preachers.”

THE FREE LANCE:

Local Guardians of Public

Purity

By JOHN OTTLEY

Quick To Chastise

For most of us when it appears|however, one message of dismal| tion seldom arises. If X said

the student magazine is a publica-
tion of varying delight to be read,
perhaps read again and possibly
sent home or to the girl. At times
we tend almost to take it for grant-
ed — it’s that much a part of
Davidson life.

From time to time we may have
some mild objection to a story
printed in it or something which
is intended to be funny but doesn’t
quite make the grade. This lack
of student criticism is lamentable,
but not a thing to fret about.

For a certain group here its
publication is no such simple
matter. It is to them like hand-
ling detonators four times oa
year. When the Scripts WN’
Pranks hits the streets, they
prick up their moral ears and
wait with nervous counte-
nances.

In the process of the mails many
letters arrive in this hamlet con-
cerning the magazine. The editor
usually receives many congratu-
latory notices and other assorte
fan letters. In the group there is,

tone.

It comes from a man whose words
are like Olympian thunderbolts to
certain folk around here. It is the
alarum bell, the spark which ig-
nites those alerted minds.

What's in this fateful
epistie? Is it word from the
printers that the magazine stil!
owes money to them? No, it is
a note hinting that there was
something in the fast issue
which was of doubtful moral-
ity.

For many nights lights burn late
in the offices of the grand inquisti-
tion. X has spoken and if he says
there is something off-color in the
magazine’ there is. Any of the
judges who might not have noticed
it had better read it over so they
can be of one mind when they
put the editor on the grill.

Of course it might be worth
wondering why the editor is
not queried until someone
writes the inquisition about
the issue, but in this author-
iterian paradise such e ques-

it ts, it fs.

All the members of the court
read the issue. Despite the utmost
of scrutiny they have difficulty
finding grounds for a charge. “Too
sexy,” suggests one. Another starts
to remind him that charge has been
overworked, but hesitates. —

Another thinks of a sugges-
tive poster hung on a wall
neer @ drink cooler where
many feculty congregate, but
hopes it will not be brought
into the case by the editor.

“There is a scantily-clad girl
there being stared at by a man
with more than her hometown on
his mind,” he muses but remains
silent.

“Bad for the name of the school,”
suggests another. Many agree with
the exception of an English pro-
fessor who wonders why the in-
quisition should pick a humor
issue for this charge. He remem-
bers several issues which have been
mailed out to the same public with
literally lousy stories in them even
