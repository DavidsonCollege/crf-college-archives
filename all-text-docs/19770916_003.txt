Freshmen are not the only new
faces on campus. This year Davidson
hired eight new full-time faculty
members.

With a wide range of interests and
with fresh ideas they are eager and
energetic in pursuing their academic
goals.

They come to Davidson from all
over the eastern United States «nd
one even hails from France.

Jean-Pierre Foubert

Visiting Professor of French Jean-
Pierre Foubert comes to Davidson on
an exchange program from the Uni-
versity of Montpellier. This is his first
visit to the United States.

Foubert is impressed with the
intimate atmosphere at. Davidson. He
explained that at Montpellier his
classes often had as many as 200
students, making personal contact
impossible.

“‘T can speak here with every
professor and meet with every stu-
dent I want to. It is very easy and
contacts are very good,”’ he said. ‘‘In
France it’s not the same. It’s impos-
sible to speak with the students.’’

Foubert, who brought his wife and
daughter with him,, said that he had
visited New York, Washington, Rich-
mond, and Williamsburg on his way
to Davidson.

‘New York was just like it appears
on the postcards and films in France;
it was exactly like I expected.”

He expressed surprise and delight
with the museums in New York and
Washington.

“Tt’s funny, I used to think that the
best French paintings were in France,
but they are in the States.’’

Foubert has found that France has
a great misconception about Ameri-
can cooking.

“IT thought as many French do that
American cooking was hamburgers.
But in Williamsburg I found much
American cooking was very good,” he
explained.

Foubert teaches sociology in
France and finds it very interesting to
observe American lifestyles close at
hand.

“‘Thave found that the Americans,

along with the English, are more
gracious and welcoming than the
French, who tend to be more re-
served,”’ he commented.

Foubert enjoys sailing and has been
out.on Lake Norman a few times. He
also enjoys films and said that he had
seen most of them in France but he

would see them again in order to

improve his English.

Summing up his delight with
Davideann he.saitt “Tur Davidson i can
relate.’”’

Kay Smith
“Being female and having red hair
really makes you stick out like a sore
thumb,” said Kay Smith, new profes-
sor of mathematics.
Smith, 27, did her undergraduate

work at Bucknell and graduate stu-

dies at Yale. This is her first full time
teaching position.

“T’m learning that I still have a lot
to learn but I’m really enjoying
teaching.”’

Smith came to Davidson for a
number of reasons. ‘While visiting
here in February I was very im-
pressed by the congeniality of the
faculty and their interest in students.

“I felt this was a place where I
could learn and where I could make a
contribution. I favor a liberal arts
education and feel that this is the
environment in which I can best
function.

‘Another factor was that people
seemed to know what Davidson could
and could not offer. There seems to be
a well defined sense of purpose at this
school.”’

Smith lived all her life in the
northeast and was interested in living
in another part of the country so that
Davidson’s location also affected her
choice.

“So far I have no complaints. I've
been impressed by the friendliness
and southern hospitality. Davidson
seems to be a comfortable and
pleasant place to live.”

Her only reservation was the social
problems that she might encounter.
“‘The community is very couple
oriented and for a single woman that
might be a bit of a problem.

“It’s difficult to start out new
anywhere but at least it makes you
conscious of the friendship making
process.”’

Smith was hired before the Christ-
ian tenure controversy and did not
reconsider her decision to come here.

“Davidson College is here, I think,
to raise the religious consciousness
and religious values of students and
not preach doctrime. It’s healthy to
have people with other views. There-
fore I was glad to see the policy
changed.’’

Smith is especially interested in
music. She plays the violin and enjoys
listening to classical music. She also
likes to cook and knit and her athletic
interests include swimming, cycling
and jogging. ‘‘Right now I am still
working on my dissertation on math-
ematical logic but I’m looking for-
ward to studying some religion and
philosophy.’’ She has been a Quaker
for seven year.

Robert Myers

Robert Myers, the new professor in
the Department of Sociology looks at
the world through different eyes than
most people. ‘‘I am a cultural
anthropologist,”” explained Myers.

“By studying primitive and mo-
dern people, a cultural anthropoligist
tries to put the human’‘role into
perspective. Myers is the first full
time anthropologist Davidson has
ever had.

He is not a newcomer to the
communtiy though. Born in Newport
News, Va., Myers attended Davidson
from 1964-68. ;

“‘T was here when there was still
required chapel and vespers, when
freshmen had to wear beanies and

» when there were no coeds. It’s really

different to be on this side of the desk
and call faculty members by their first
name.”

Not knowing exactly what he
wanted to study, Myers went on
Davidson’s JYA program to Mar-
burg. ““That trip really helped crystal-
ize my interest in anthropology,
because I had the chance to travel and
see a lot of different people. Junior
year abroad was one of the most
rewarding experiences I ever had.”’

Myers did his graduate studies at ~

Chapel Hill. He lived a year in the
West Indies with his family doing a
community study on the effects of
emigration.

He has taught part time at Chapel
Hill, N.C. State, and Duke and spent
last year studying genetics, biostatics
and epidemology at Chapel Hill.

“T came back to Davidson because
it’s a good school and if. you were to
compare Davidson with any other
school in the country, it would
compare very favorable.

“The people are friendly and, most
importantly, it’s a community, some-
thing you do not find at very many
other schools.

Myers is interested in all kinds of
sports including jogging, handball
and sailing. He is married and has
two sons, Andrew and Christopher,
ages 6 and 8. ‘‘We’re a close knit
family and enjoy taking trips together
or going on picnics.’’

Myers is also teaching part time at
Barber Scotia through December. He
is teaching Human Origins and
Cultural Anthropology this term and
will be teaching Anthropology of the
South, Anthropology of Medicine and
two introductory sociology courses in
winter and spring.

Randy Nelson

After teaching at the University of
Louisville, Randy Nelson returned to
his native North Carolina to fill a
position in the English Department
here.

In'his academic field, which is
American Literature, Nelson has a
continuing interest in Mark Twain
and Henry David Thoreau (whom he
emphatically explains pronounced his
name like the word ‘‘Thorough’’).

One of his pet projects is a book he
is compiling called Amazing Facts
which are interesting sidelights on
literature and history.

‘It’s not ‘so low class as mere
trivia,”’ he’said. ‘‘You can get across a

fairly deadly piece ty theory

fairly easily with some of these facts.’’
Nelson was originally a landscape
architect major at North Carolina
State University when his interest in
these amusing anecdotes convinced
him his true field was English. He
continued his studies at Princeton
where he recieved his doctorate.

‘ Nelson had alresdy been hired by
the College when the Christian tenure
controversy make national headlimes.
He admitted that the news caused
him some concern but he was confi-
dent the issue would be resolved.

‘Davidson traditionally had been a
liberalizing influence on the commun-
ity around it and I was sure it would
not keep \

Nelson’s outside interests include
swimming, horticulture, and collect-
ing old books.

He has been impressed with friend-
liness of the Davidson College com-
munity and was pleased at the “‘lack
of an adversity relationship” between
students and faculty.

‘My wife and I deliberately chose
communities,’’ explained Nelson, and
he indicated they were happy with
their decision.

For his initial impression of David-
son, Nelson concluded that it was ‘‘a
healthy place to be.”’

Louis Ortmayer

New professor of Political Science,
Louis Ortmayer concentrates his aca-
demic interests on international com-
parative studies. His specialities in-
clude German politics and Eastern
European relations in general.
Ortmayer comes to Davidson from
the Political. Science department at
St. John’s University in Minnesota,
where he taught for the past two year.

‘‘T was drawn to Davidson by the
quality of the school and by the fact
that there is more diversity here than
in staid and regional Minnesota.”

He was impressed by the interna-
tional scope of the department.
‘International Politics are much more
in the mainstream at Davidson.”’

Ortmayer completed his. under-
graduate work at the School of
Internation Studies at Denver. He
also lived two and a half years in
Bonn, where he did research for his
dissertation on German-Polish rela-
tions.-

Ortmayer expressed satisfaction
with the ‘‘strong communtiy atmos-
phere” at Davidson. A strong advo-
cate of study abroad, Ortmayer also
appreciates the importance placed on
internation education.

“When I was an undergraduate at
Yale I was discouraged from studying
abroad. I think though, that it can be
one of the most rewarding experiences
of your undergraduate years.”

Coming from St. John’s, where
there was never more that ten percent
