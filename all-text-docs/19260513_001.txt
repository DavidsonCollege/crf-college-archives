lar schedule of events to last throughout the
entire day has been planned.

Special regulations in regard to dress and
proper conduct will be enforced and a num-
ber of other secial features have been added
such as the calling of time every minute dur-

Students Vote to
Adopt Amendment
On Second Ballot

At a meeting of the student body after
chapel Monday morning, the following
amendment was added to the student govern-
ment constitution: “No student shall be
guilty of passing a bad check.” This amend-
ment was not included it the honor section
of the constitution, but will become
3 of Article 5.

Section

This change in the constitution was first
proposed by Don Stewart two weeks ago,
but in accordance: with the rules governing
amendments it was not voted upon until 10
days after, Friday, April 30th. At this time
it was again brought before the students by
Don Stewart, and, after discussion,
was duly voted upon. It was favored by a
vote of .254 to 97 against. It was announced
as passed Saturday morning, but R. W.
Graves immediately objected on the grounds
that those favoring it were not a two-thirds
majority, of those present at the time of
voting. To establish this number Don Whar-
ton arose and read statement Dean
Sentelle that, to the best of his knowledge,
407 men were present at chapel Friday, As
time was pressing, the final decision of its
validity Was postponed.

On Monday, Jim ‘Pinkney,
the student body, announced that the claims
the minority were sustained. W._H.
Branch, Jr.; took the floor and proposed a
motion to reconsider the amendment, on the
grounds that he had voted against it
wished to change his vote. This motion was
A protest by Wood Brown. that an-
other period of 10 days must elapse before
voting on it again The
amendment was strongly supported in
speech by Jim Hendrix, and the second bal-
lot was then cast. It was passed by a vote
of 302 to 66 opposed.

The amendment as adopted gives the Stu-
dent Council authority to take up the case of
a bad check, but since it is not included in
the honor section, no one is honor bound to
report cold checks. Although comparatively
few of the Davidson students pass bad checks
voluntarily,
intend to take them up when money comes
from home, these few cast had shadow
upon those innocent of this practice and upon
the good reputation of the college, and it
was thought only best and fittest that this
matter should be regulated by the Student
Council.

Davidson College Magazine, Reviewed

The latest issue of the Davidson Col-
lege Magazine, edited by the Blue Pencil
chapter ofthe Sigma Upsilon fraternity,
and appropriately named The Chameleon,
made its appearance last week and was
warmly welcomed by the many students,
who had begun to despair of receiving
any further chronicle of literary genius
this term.

Since the acceptance by the student-
body some months ago of a resignation
submitted by the staff of the magazine,
due to what they termed too stringent
faculty control, the college has been
without atiy medium through which the
promising young essayists, poets, and au-
thors in our midst might give expression
to their aesthétic and exotic inclinations.
But The Chameleon came as a God-send,
and the literary genius of the college has
been saved from a gruesome death of
suffocation.

The Chameleon has served well its pur-

| pose, provided its purpose was to stir up
be awarded. This is to be followed by the|

latent thought and provoke a fuller ap-

graduating exercises, after which the last|preciation of certain American authors,

| ism. The magazine has set a new goal

at Davidson for originality of thought, At-
tractiveness of make-up, and fearlessness
of expression.

One cannot help but admire the bold
way in which some of the contributors,
undoubtedly proteges of a certain H. L.
Mencken, made subtle and engaging at-
tacks on fundamentalism and the estab-
lish and the established doctrines. But,
some still contend that the Davidson Col-
iege Magazine was never intended to re-
flect the innovations of such magazines
The Dial, American Mercury, The
Century, and a host of other periodicals of
the like. Heretofore, socialism, commun-
ism, sovietism and other radical tenets
have been subordinated to what the con-
tributors of The Chameleon are wont to
ridicule as “Babbitism:’ The subtle and
obscure manner in which certain con-
tributors to the new. magazine hid their
new ideals under a ridiculing picture of a
‘~worid in which free thought was violent-
ly suppressed, deserves commendation
for its cleverness, but there still remains
the question as to whether it all repre-
sented what is left of Davidson literary
genius. Does radicalism denote genius in
this newer day, or is this idea of oppos-

Mrs. Lingle began her address by paying
a tribute to the Y. M,C. A. “The ‘Y’ is the
best thing on the campus,” she said, “and |
am delighted to see the increasing interest
it taking in the the
school.” After paying this high tribure to

Mrs. Lingle stated that she would not at-
tempt to “eulogize Motherhood,” “but it is
my desire,” she said, “to represent to you
boys who are present, your own Mothers who
are so far away.” Continuing, she reminded
the that “Mother's Day” had
lorigin in the minds of men and not in the
minds of the women.

Mrs. Lingle, in a charming manner re-
minded the boys who were present that it)
was no so long ago when our Mothers were
flushed with the happiness of youth and cap-
turing the hearts of the moody young jack-
anapes who worshiped at the shrine of their
loveliness. She stated that our Mothers love
boys now just as they did then, “only now,”
she said, “their love is centered. on one or |
two, yourself and your brother, if you have
one.’ “Your Mothers, when they were
searching for the man they were to marry, |
looked for good men with clean morals, and |
today they are looking to their sons, expect-
ing to-find inculcated in them the same high
ideals that marked their fathers.

In closing Mrs. Lingle assured those in
attendance that every Mother holds a treasure
for her son. And that treasure, she spoke
of as theoretically, it being an ancestral cul-

as to who would take the lead forthe next

first two innings, but in the third Elon pushed
across three counters, which feat was dupli-
cated by few minutes later, in
their half of the third, Flon went out ahead

last of the sixth, when Davidson scored two
runs, to take the lead, which she held until

Vance came to the bat.

After one man was out in the tenth, Vance
to the plate, and took mighty
swing, the bat slipping out of his hands and
going to third base, The next was a ball,
but the next was to the liking of the David-
son giant, and he poled out the longest homer
that has ever been seen on the loeal park.
The ball clearéd the Fight fielder’s head about
six feet ona line, and did nof top rolling un-—

of the field. This was the most opportune
