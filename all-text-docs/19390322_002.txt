Staff Election

For a long time the Davidson election
system of no politics has been criticized on
the grounds that the candidates’ qualifica-

“tion for the office to which they are nom-
inated are not ‘known by the majority of
the voters. This is a very justified criticism,
particularly in the case of The Davidsonian.
The most popular candidate will not neces-
sarily make the best editor, therefore in all
fairness to the office, the candidates, the
paper itself, and what it represents, only
those who are in a position to know the
respective abilities of the candidates should
be entitled to vote for the Editor, The new
system will place a premium on ability and
effort rather than popularity.

Since it is one of the most radical chang-
es proposed on the campus in years, this
idea merits the of
every member of the student body, The big

c of course, is that perhaps
politics within the staff,

serious consideration
objection to it,
there night be
and that we will be out of the frying pan
into the fire. To those of us who have spent
a large part of our time and energy work-
ing on the paper for two or more years this
argument seems entirely out of place. It has
meant a great deal to us, and every man
on the ‘proposed committee of eighteen has
far too high a regard for The Davidsonian
to allow politics or petty prejudices to in-
terfere with his casting his vote for the one
whom he honestly believes is the best man.

We Bid Farewell
If all goes well, by the time the next is-
sue appears a new staff will be at the helm
of The Davidsonian. As always, the way has

been beset by rocks and shoals, but we of
the present staff have thoroughly enjoyed
and profited immensely by our work of the
year. So it is with a mingled feeling of re-
lief and regret that we turn the job over
to our successors, Before the final word of
farewell, however, I would like to express
appreciation to some of those whose co-
operation has been so inyaluable.

The managing editors have dene their
jobs admirably, with the real interest of
the paper at heart, and a perfect blend of
efficiency and helpfulness. Our greatest
regret is that all six can’t be editor. Any of
them would be a splendid one. The assistant

editor, Terrell Porter, comes in for a big
chunk of praise. His has been a thankless

task, but without thought of gain or glory
he has performed it admirably, sitting up
nearly all of every Monday night to copy-
read every word and punctuation mark that
goes into the paper.

We have received the best of co-opera-
tion from the faculty advisor, the college
administration, faculty, and town in gen-
eral. We especially appreciate the interest
that many members of the student body
have shown. Of course it would never do
for any studefit to openly exhibit any re-
gard for the paper, or to do other than
gripe about it at every available opportu-
nity, but we have received a great many
helpful criticisms, letters to the editor, and
compliments, which at least show that the
student body is aware of the existence of a
weekly publication on the campus!

To Our Successor

Finally, may we quote an editorial to our
successor that was addressed to us in The
Davidsonian a year ago.

You, Mr. Editor-to-be, have a consid-
erable job ahead of you. The way is not
easy. The first thirty issues are the hard-
est. But seriously, here is a bit of advice
from a fellow-newspaperman out west.

“The college editor should make a slight
distinction between himself and his job.
The job is important; he is not. The editor-
ship is as responsible a position, in its po-
tential power to help or harm the college as
the presidency of the college.

The editor, unless he is a child prodigy,
must proceed thoughtfully and with due
regard for the errors of his predecessors if
he is properly to fulfill that responsibility.”

—The Daily Illinois.

And when you have finished your task.
you will feel a sentiment akin to that ex-
pressed in this little poem from our ex-
changes:

“What have you done?” Saint Peter asked,
“That I should admit you here 2”

“IT ran a paper,” the editor said,

“At my college for one long year.”

Saint Peter fittingly shook his head

And gravely touched the bell.

“Come in, poor man, select a harp,

You've had your share of Hell.”

But the best of luck to you, Mr. Editor-
to-be, and your staff. May your success be.
great and your difficulties few and far be-
tween,

Campus Comments

Since Davidson does not have politics in
the student body elections and the Student
Council is pledged to uphold this tradition a
better method electing the Editor-in-
chief of the Davidsonian has become nec-
essary, Most of the student body, not know-
ing the internal makeup and personnel of
the paper, if they are interested at all in
having the most capable man elected must

of

ask someone connected with, the staff for
information. This is especially true now
‘that the freshmen have been allowed to
vote. This is not directed toward personal-
ities or groups but seems merely to be the
best time for such comment since popular
vote has been increased.

In order to be sure of choosing without
corruption the man®*who is best fitted for
the position- logically he should be elected
hy the paper’s own staff which always has
an immediate and genuine interest in the
progress and perfection of journalism on
the campus. Under the proposed amend-
ment the eighteen most experienced in pub-
lishing the Davidsonian and therefore the
best qualified to determine its new leader
are given full electoral power. This body is
composed of three groups: (1) the
the Editor-in-chief
who have had the eligible candidates work-
ing for them, (2) the present managing ed-
itors and the sports editor (the candidates
themselves) who have just completed a year
of actual work with each other and, (3) the
six new managing editors who have work-

five

associate editors and

ed ‘under the candidates and who must co-
operate with their new Editor in continu-
ing the job as smoothly as possible.

Not that the Davidsonian has suffered
because of influences brought to bear on
the popular vote in the past, but merely as
an improved way to selections in the fu-
ture, we earnestly solicit your approval of
the proposed amendment.

Most sincerely,

PERRY SLOAN,
Associate Editor and Councilman.

Letters To The Editor

Dear Bill:

The amendment pre-
sented in chapel this morning is
something we have been waitj
for for at least four years. Eve
year there is considerable discus-
sion of the matter of staff elec-
tions for the Davidsonian, but no
one has had the gumption to de-
vise and present a workable plan.

As one who worked on the Da-
and
one who is intensely anxious to see
“A Better Davidson,” I believe this
is a real solution to our problem.

There are many qualifications for
the editorship of the Davidsonian

body are not in a position to judge.

Only those who have watched the

“All American” rating for our pa-
per every: year, we must let the
staff pick the man who can get

out that. type of a paper.

Of course, we who have nothing
to with the Davidsonian hate
to give up our privilege of electing
the editor. But we feel that if we

who can use it more intelligently,

The staff members are obviously

qualified for the job? Of course,
it has been objected by some that
there will be more politics at work
in-staff elections than student body
slefions. Aside from the fact that
the staff is not composed of the
type of worm that forms combines
and unions, there is the obvious
fact that the members of the staff
are divided almost equally among
so many different groups that it
is not at all likely that there will
be any unfair collusion.

The least we can do is to give
the plan a try. If it does not work,
we can always amend the consti-
tution again and reassume our sac-
rificed power. We are not letting
it out of our hands. We are only
delegating it to those of our rep-
resentatives who-know the most
about the situation.

A letter like this isn't really nec-
eSsary. Nobody is going to set ig-
norance over knowledge in as grave
a decision as the editorship of our
paper. But just to be on the safe

Your Film Report Card

By CHARLIE LUTHER

“YES MY DARLING DAUGH-
TER"’—Priscilla Lane, Jeffry Lynn,
May Robson, and Fay Bainter.

This picture is meant to be a
satire on the freedom with which
women live their lives today, but
it is done with such humor that
you are likely to forget its social
message. Which is just as well.

Priscilla Lane plays the daugh-

ter who reacts too completely to
her liberal mother. The mother
(Fay Bainter) used to be a suf-
frage crusader when she wasn't
having an affair with a poet (Ro-
land Young). But, now she is mar-
ried to a banker, Fay is horrified
when Priscilla camly decides to go
off on a week-end with Jeffry
Lynn. The girl’s intentions are of
the social’ experiment order, but
the situation makes for dialogue
a bowdy leer.
Granny May Robson steals the
show and Jeffry Lynn puts in a
good bid playing the part of the
young man who loves Priscilla.

Most of the week-end at the
cottage where Priscilla and Jeffry
spend the week-end will most like-
ly be cut before it gets here.

Thursday and Friday,
March 23 and 24
ee,

“TAILSPIN”—Alice Fay, Con-
stance Bennet, Joan Davis, Nancy
Kelly, and Jane Wyman.

The film deals with the girls who
slave to compete, with rattletrap
ships in the Powder Puff—wom-
en’s air race, to the multitude.
After several reel exploiting the
perils and sacrifices of Alice Faye,
Nancy Kelly, and Jane Wyman, up
pops heiress Constance Bennet,
who brings her special plane to
the derby—not for money, but to
show the man she loves that she
has courage. There is a beautiful
love story between Miss Kelly and

Edward Norris; Joan Davis and
Wally Vernon work at starchy
comedy. Alice Faye has a poor

role, but manages to survive.

Parade of Opinion

By ASSOCIATED COLLEGIATE PRESS

PARDON Long a topic of soci-
al-minded collegians and_ their
teachers, the question of Tom
Mooney’s guilt or. innocence was
settled to their great satisfaction
when California's Gov. Culbert Ol-
son freed the man who spent 22
years in prison for his alleged par-
ticipation in a Preparedness Day
bombing in 1916.

Not one of the hundreds of pcol-
lege newspaper editors raised a dis-
senting voice over Gov. Olson’s
pardon. Most of them lauded him
with many words and flowery sen-
tences, and many hailed it as the
beginning of an “era of industrial
compatability—a realization that re-
sponsible unionism, legitimately
recognized, is equally beneficial to

SUPER SNOOPINGS

By KEN LAWSON
Here comes the musicians with
a bang, bang! Never did it enter
my mind that a few short sentences

in last week's column could stir
up all the feeling, both pro and
con, that has been. expressed to
me. So for the benefit of the fol-
lowers of Pfohl, let me expound
more fully my views which were
so condensed in the Davidsonian
last week.

The reason was not that I am
allergic to music or that I do not
believe music has its place in the
development of the asthetic side
of man, because I was exposed to
musical training myself for eight
or nine years. And for the man
who is considering music as a ca-
reer desires the development
of this side of his nature for pleas-
ure in after years, I believe that
the musical department
definite purpose.

What I had reference to in last
week’s column was the large num-
ber. of men of better than average
ability who enter these organiza-
tions merely as 4n extra-curricu-
lar activity and are chagrined
about their junior year to find
that they are out for no activities
which put them in line for campus
leadership offices. If the members

or

serves a

of the, band, ete. have just as
much leadership ability as the
groups out for other activities,

which I believe to be true, then a
check on the membership in ODK
over several years based on the
Proportion of one group to another
will reveal the point that IT am at-
tempting to make.

I am in favor of the music de-
because I

partment

believe it has

a definite place in collegiate life,

but I do believe some definite
method should be worked out
whereby members of these dif-

ferent groups would not spend so
much of their time in these or-
ganizations that chances of get-
ting somewhere in activities rated
much higher in the point system
would be neglected. If you don’t
think my views are mild compared
to those of the majority of the
student body, I invite you to take
a straw vote among the leaders on
the campus the way I did before
writing this. Now that that is ex-
plained I hope my position will be
better understood.

With all the space taken up by
the clarification above, there isn’t
much room left for dope; but here
is some that was just too good to
omit: Popeye McAlpine displaying
a canine aptitude for Packards
while Karl Hudson felt the call
of the bright lights and Neal Scott

ity . . . Squirrel Erle Austin set-

In the Groove

By TOM PERRIN

CLASS Some few. weeks
back we ran a little item about the
illustrious class of ’I8 and the
fact that it has four members on
the present faculty. Well, we'd al-
most forgotten about it ourselves
when a professor reminded us last
week and pointed out that we were
overlooking a class which has still
more members on the teaching
staff. “s

The class of ’'21 is this super-
class, and it numbered among its
students boys named Schenck,
Beaty, C. K. Brown, and Cum-
ming. All qualified as B. M. O. C’s.
And, of course, all are still behind
desks here, only now they’re fac-
ing the classes. As our professor
says,.each of these actually teach-
es, while Mr. Hengeveld of the
class of "18 pulls down his class’
average, being employed in a mere
executive capacity.

CAPS . Those “D” caps or
crew caps, as Student Store Man-
ager Telford the Red designates
them, are really pretty sporty and
will probably sell well hereabouts,
particularly as an aid in thumbing
rides. But—just an idle thought—
it seems a bit odd that the fresh-
man of a year or so ago who
bought a freshman cap with fear
and hatred in his heart and who
wore it only because of dire threats
now eagerly pays well to wear
essentially the same thing.

As a matter of fact, since these

lids do look pretty smooth, why
not get something very similar for
the Frosh next year? Maybe it
would make the little wildcats
easier to handle.

BIRDIE ... Here’s one for Rip-
ley—or maybe the sports editor.
You might be interested, too.

ball practice Monday was J. D.
Hicks, star hurler. Busily flying on
its own sweet business—something
to do with spring, no doubt—was
a bird of undetermined variety. To
make a short story, one of Hick’s
flies smacked solidly into the feath-
ered critter. Players and bystand-
ers gazed in amazement as feath-
ers fluttered down and the bird
fluttered off,

ing this view of the Syracuse Uni-
versity “Daily Orange,” the Grin-
nell College “Scarlet and Black”
hails the pardon as something more
than just a victory for labor. It
claims that “it is a .triumph of
something a very great deal bigger
than labor—justice has been done
at last. The act comes as a burst of
light to a world increasingly dark-
ened by injustice and by bitter
strife.”

A neat commentary on modern-
day politics was added to its editor-
ial by the University of Iowa “Daily
Towan:” “Governor Olson of Calif-
ornia deserves full credit for being
an unusual politician. He made a
campaign promise, and he kept it.
That’s all too rare in these parts,
any parts for that matter.”
