Council Debates Duties,
Revitalization Of Clubs

Discussion. concerning the re.

Council meeting Monday morn-

B.l] Watson, chairman of the
Student Council Student Activi-

idea, stressing that-the possible
“revitalization” was “only an
inquay to determ:ne S:udent

Several council members op-
posed this, the objection being
that projects should come from
the club members’ own initia-

Watson tab‘ed further discus-

the matter further with faculty
members and club presidents.

White Investigates Use
Of Work-Study Funds

H. Edimunds White, director of
admissions and financial aid,
explained that the restriction
about students from low income
families was relaxed. as so few
colleges made use of the pro-
gram.

Special consideration is still
given to students of Jow income
families, but now the college
can use the remaining funds
for any student in need of aid.

Davidson has some students
who qualified for the aid under
the original restriction. All were
offered work-study jobs and
most are working. Other stu-
dents in need of aid have also
received some of. the program’s
funds. A student considered in
need of aid would not be offered
program funds if he held a
scholarship.

There has been some dissatis-
faction among other student
workers because the Work-Study
Program participants are paid
a higher wage.

|

The college salary is $1.00 per
hour whereas the Work.Study
Program pays $1.25 per hour.
Some students have been forced
out of jobs as priority is given
to program participants. even
though the program was de-
signed to create new jobs. It
was not intended to affect pre-
viously existing ‘jobs.

White emphasized that $2450
a year (minimum expense for
1966) is a substantial sum and
comprises a considerable portion
of many families’ income.

As long as Davidson has the
funds, students in need of aid
will receive it through campus
employment in the Work-Study
Program.

Some of the students on the
program have quit because they
have found off-campus jobs. The
employers in the program agree
that. it is worthwhile and are
impressed by the work of the
students. ;

Most of the students appreci-
ate the value of the program,
as it helps relieve their parents
of a financial burden, White
said.
