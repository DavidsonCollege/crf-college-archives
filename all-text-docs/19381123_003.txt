Question

of th Week

In line with the suggestion
made by Dr. Lingle in his an-
nouncement during chapel last
week, the Davidsonian ques-
tioned several students as fol-
lows: Do you have any special
ideas as to how the new dormi-
tory should be built?

A majority of the ones queried
favored an arrangement of suites of
two and three rooms, only one out
of five definitely favoring the single
room arrangement. The individual
answers are below:

Hugh Verner, Junior: :

My conception of the new dormi-
tory: A three story building with
stairs in the center; slightly larger
closets; showers on each floor plac-
ed ,in a room to themselves. Then,
too, the lighting facilities in Tooms
could be more up to date by install-
ing wall plugs. This would take a-
way the necessity of dropping cords
from the ceiling. Two indirect lamps
in each room would improye study-
ing conditions a great fa. I be-
lieve that these changes in the new
dormitory would make a better Da-
vidson.

“Cowboy” Moore, Sophomore:

I think that one good improve-
men over the present dormitories
would be to have several base plugs
or electrical outlets: in the wooden
baseboards around the botton of the
room, which would eliminate much
of the faulty wiring which students
must put up in order to connect
their radios and other appliances.
This would also help to cut down
on the lights going out as the re-
sult of a short circuit. This occurs
all too frequently on the night be-
fore a review. Another improve-
ment along this line would be to
have a switch at the door to con-
trol the lights. I also wish to sec-
ond the motion of “Letters to the
Editor” last week to make a dormi-
tory which will not only be a plea-
sure to live in but will add to the
beauty of the campus.

Bill Boyd, Senior:

I believe that the new dormitory
should be built along the lines of
the Tenements at the University of
South Carolina. In this arrangement
three or four boys live in a suite of
two rooms and a bath, the bath
being between the two rooms. One
of these rooms could be used for
studying and the other for sleep-
ing. This dormitory should be large
enough to house all the boys living
in town and the Barracks, It would
also be nice if it did not look like
all the present dormitories.

Louis Hite, Sophomore:

I think that a dormitory with as
nice rooms as East and West now
have, with running water in each
room, and a shower on each floor,
would be all right for a school the
size of Davidson. I am not in favor
of a suite of rooms each one holding
four boys, as it would be more dif-
ficult for four boys to get along to-
gether than two. The building
should be about three stories high,
with rooms for students in the
basement.

Jack Abernethy, Junior:

An ideal dormitory would be one
divided into two-room suites, with
one of the rooms being used for
sleeping and the other room being
used for studying. Two boys would
be a good number for each suite,
with four suites to a hall. The dorm-
itory ought to be laid out by floors,
with a bath on each floor. A dormi-
tory such as this might be too ex-
pensive for a school the size of Da-
vidson to have, but if it were at
all possible, I would like to see the
college erect such a building.

selection of the blazer several days
ago. This committee was composed

samples of the blazers arrived they

coat was selected.
