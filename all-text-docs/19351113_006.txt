Council Dances
Well Attended

(Continued from Page 1)

A multitude of beautiful girls appeared
from ports far and near; the rhythmical
and entertaining music of Jimmie Poyner
and his orchestra still echoes in the ears
many; memories of Keith Scales
singing, the good times had by all—
blending in color and beauty with last
week-end flit before one’s eyes; all made
to appear and disapepar as if by the
magic touch of the Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil.

Davidson's Homecoming Dances
gan under the sponsorship of the Pan-
Hellenic Council on Friday evening, the
8th. The night was tilled with a tormal
dance, accommodating many
seekers. The crowd began to appear quite
early in the ball room of the Hotel Char-
lotte, and grew very rapidly with the
dance ending at two o'clock.

Due to the Duke-Davidson tvotball
game, no Saturday afternoon tea Dance
was held. Saturday night an informal
dance in the main dining room of the
Hotel Charlotte was given, lasting from
eight-thirty until twelve o'clock.

Aiter the dance Saturday, many of the

known summer resorts, among them Vir-

the orchestra was Keith Scales, vocalist,
Whose selections added much to the en-
joyment of all.

The old custom of having four no-
breaks at each dance was continued, and
all tootball players who played against
Duke were admitted the Saturday
night dance as guests of the Pan-Hel-
lenic Council.

The ten social fraternities were hosts
to a large number of guests, alumni, and
visitors who thronged the campus, with
approximately twelve different states rep-
resented.

Students Pause In

Memory As Armistice
Is Observed

(Continued from Page 1)

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, the president of
the college, spoke to the student body,
reminding them of the great horrors and
losses of the war and challenging them
to find a intelligent and
Christian way to settle international con-

new, more
troversies,

He that the World War
fought with two objectives in view: to
make the world safe for democracy, and
to end all wars. Neither
goals was attained, for the world today
is much more autocratic and less demo-
cratic than before the War, and far more
war-like than ever before in the memory
of the present generation.

said was

one of these

He closed by reminding his audience
that Armistice Day is set aside as a holi-
day not to glorify War, but to seek after
World Peace.

Davidson College had one of the 550
Students’ Army Training Corps which
were established in the fall of 1918. Al!
the men-eighteem years old or over, en-
rolled in the college for that term, who
were physically fit, became members of
the Corps. Academic work was consid-

ered of secondary importance during this
period, and military science and _ tactics
Were put in the fore. After the signing
of the Armistice, the enthusiasm disap-
peared and the unit was demobilized on
December 10, 1918.

The college show that 735
students and alumni of Davidson entered
the service, not including the 223 men in
the Students’ Army Training Corps. Of
this number (959) twenty men died on
the tield of battle or in camp hospitals:

and Auburn, and reeled off great chunks
of yardage that ultimately resulted in
touchdowns. Davidson, although  dis-
heartened by bringing the ball back on
Lafferty’s long run, played one of the
headiest and most courageous games of
the season against the superior and heav-
ier Blue Devils. Although having one
punt blocked, Paul Pittman kicked them
far and wide to average over 46 yards.
Duke piled up 12 first downs to David-

of them himself. If he has to repay any
of them, he was requested to put to whom
they were owed, if they are not to be
repaid he was asked to give the way they
were obtained. The last question was if
any earnings were made by the student

Evidently he was speaking of Woody
Burns.

Physically, Duke seems
heavier than UNC but as one student
here said, ‘“Bhey haven't the spirit that
Carolina has.”

Had Lafferty’s touchdown play been
good we believe the game would have
been much closer, but whether he
stepped out or not, the spectators were
quick to realize that the officials were
probably right as is the case 99 out of
100 times. It was a bitter pill tho’.

Duke played rough it is true,
but football is a rough game. We
think the ’cats did well to stand
up against a line which weighed

to be much

194-pounds per man as against

Davidson's 176-pounds. The Duke

linesmen averaged approximately

6.1 feet in height. No wonder they

snagged those passes.

A little incident happened in Greens-
boro Friday morning which we believe
might afford a little interest although it
is of no significance.

Felix’s “ole man,” affectionately speak-
ing, was visited by an official in Greens-
boro’s boxing circles and another per-
son who wasn’t recognized at the time.

The official—after pointing to his com-
panion (a nicely dressed, clean-cut indi-
vidual with what we might call “a very
quick eye”) abandoned all formalities by
questioning “do you know who this is?”

“No, I don’t believe I do.”

The official, already picturing the as-
tonishment that would visit his friend,
casually explained that he was favored
by a visit from none other than Jack
Dempsey in person.

Dempsey smiling, extended a huge
hand in greetings and explained that he
was passing through Greensboro on busi-
ness,

“Sorry you aren’t back in the
ring to fight Louis.”

“Well—the years tell on us,”
stated Dempsey. ‘When they take
it away from us we can’t get it
back.’’

Asked about Joe Luois, Jack ex-
plained that ‘Louis is a good fight-
er” but if someone with a hard
punch and plenty of experience
ever gets in the ring with him he'll
probably go down.

The old “Manassas Mauler” pointed
out that “Braddock will give him (Louis)
a whole lot better fight than people
think. Braddock has a good heart and
he’s a good fighter.”
