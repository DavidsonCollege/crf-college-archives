Lancaster's Provides Taste of Real NC Bar-B- Q

By Rachel Newcomb
A few miles up the road in
Mooresville, Lancaster’s Eastern
N.C. Style Bar-b-que offers a wide
range of options for the barbecue
lover. Owned by Jeff Lancaster,
Lancaster’s has been in business
since December 1986 and moved
to its current location this past
December.
Lancaster’ sis housed ina spa-

Music...
Forget Seattle,

Minneapolis
Has the Sound

By Peter Arnold

Life is too short to listen ex-
clusively to one typé of music. All
ofus havea favorite grouporsound
that we like, but if you limit your-
self to only that group or sound,
you are selling yourself short and
missing.a lot of great music that is
available. In the next few issues;
willattempt to give you ALBUMS
YOUCANNOT POSSIBLY LIVE
WITHOUT. We'll try for two
albums a week until the end of the
semester. Oh, it’s way too early to
Start freaking out about exams.

Husker Du, a band from Min-
neapolis, comes to my mind as one
of the all time greats. Nobody has
duplicated the sound these-guys
cranked out for the ten years they
were together. Headed up by Bob
Mould, who is now with the band
Sugar, Husker Du came out of the
Minneapolis scene inthe early 80’s
witharecord deal from Twin Tone.
They went on to record five more
albums before splitting up.

The Husker Du sound is domi-
nated by aguitar thatis compressed
about a thousand times and a tight
drum sound similar to Stewart
Copeland of the Police. The best
album these guys recorded is Flip
Your Wig (1985). Thisalbum gives
the listener a taste of the sound that
came out of the Midwest, a heavy
sort of chaotic noise. Some of the
tracks come close to Nirvana’s
Territorial Pissings. A track that
comes to mind is “Divide and Con-
quer,” a sweet little ditty about
how screwed up our country and
governmentare. This band is most
definitely worth listening to.

To stay with the Minneapolis
scene, one can’t forget the “new
kids on the block,” Soul Asylum.
To give an idea about where S.A.
fits into the “Minneapolis
timeline,” they are the lastbig band
to emerge. Prince was the first,
followed by Husker Du, The Re-
placements and then S.A. Ihad the
chance to see Soul Asylum over
Christmas break at First Ave., a
club in downtown Minneapolis.
Besides being way too loud, the
concert was aclassic— the singer/

white checkered floor mixed with
the racetrack decor create a bright
and comfortable feeling.
Menuchoices range from bar-
becue sandwiches to entire plat-
ters, all prepared in the “Eastern
N.C. Style.” According to Mr.
Lancaster, Eastern N.C. style is a
vinegar-based barbecue that origi-
nated in the eastern part of the
state. Itis different from the sweet,
ketchup-based barbecue that is
popular in other areas of the South.

Lancaster’s secret family recipe
successfully masters the Eastern
N.C. style fora perfectly seasoned,
spicy sauce.

My dining companion had the
combination barbecue pork &
chicken platter, accompanied by
brunswick stew, potatoes and slaw.
He pronounced the barbecue to be
very delectable and also enjoyed
the hearty brunswick stew. I tried
the buffalo wings, proclaimed by
the menuas the “world’s greatest.”
They were quite savory, cooked in
the secret barbecue sauce with a

celery and blue cheese dressing. I
recommend a side order of the

pliment the wings very well.
Lancaster’s also offers fried
chicken, all types of barbecue pork,
hushpuppies, catfish dinners, sand-
wiches, andcorn dogs and chicken
fingers for the kids. Catering is
also an option. One of the good
things about Lancaster’s is the
hearty portions.’ For under five
dollars, Lancaster’s enormous din-
ners are an excellent bargain. Our

Renowned Endellion io.
Quartet to Perform at Davidson

By Ceci Combs

The Endellion String Quartet
will be performing tonight at 8:15
p.m. in Hodson Hall. This British
quartet has been touring interna-
tionally for 14 years and has re-
cently completed a successful tour
of the United States. Visiting ma-
jor European cities such as Paris,
Amsterdam and Rome as well as
South America and the Middle
East, the players have earned their

reputation as one of the finest string
quartets on the international scene.
The players include Andrew
Watkinson, first violin; Ralph de
Souza, 2nd violin; Garfield Jack-
son, viola; and David Waterman,
cello.

Affectionately known as the
“Dellis,” the foursome has main-
tained a large following at home.
They are frequent guests on BBC

Radio and Television as well as at

many chamber music festivals. The
quartet is known for its innovative
renditions of pieces by classical
composers such as Haydn and
Mozart.

After a performance, The Lon-
don Times once commented that
“their sense of spontaneous enjoy-
ment wasreflected as much in their
faces as in the lovely sounds they
produced.” This performance will
be one you don’t want to miss.

Harmony, Diversity Found in "Control"

By Geoffrey Graham .

Students have lived with
friends for far too long. It’s about
time these exclusive clusters were
broken up, andreplaced by diverse
halls with little incommon. End-
ing clusters is not enough. The
college must go farther. If we
earnestly want a completely di-
verse school, we must put an end to
all relationships based solely on
shared interests and like back-
grounds.

The school’s discontinuation

of clustering is a movement in the
right direction. The first step in an

It is definitely worth the six

the barbecue at Lancaster’s. Their

good, and the family-type atmo-

Movie Review ...

Subtlety Makes
Groundhog
Day a Blast

By Scott McLean

Bill Murray’s latest outing in
the movies, Groundhog Day, can
best be described asa happy, funny,
feel-good flick for the spring of
1993. A fter having tackled several
serious films in this column as of
late, it was a relief to see a light-
hearted picture like this one. While
this is no Ghostbusters or
Caddyshack or one of Bill’s other
big films of the early ‘80’s (and
who expected it to be), it is one’of
his better films-and is quite an
entertaining one at that.

Murray plays Phil Connors, a
Pittsburgh weatherman who heads
to a small town to do his annual
report on the Groundhog Day Fes-
tival that takes place there. In tow
are his producer Rita (Andie
MacDowell) and his cameraman
who are both upbeat and friendly
and provide anice foil to Murray’s
arrogant and sarcastic character.
In any case, if you haven’t heard
the catch of the story yet, it is that
Connors finds himself reliving the
same day, Groundhog Day, over
and over again. The fun really
starts when he decides to use this to
his advantage.

Director Harold Ramis,
Murray’s longtime partner in
crime, manages to keep the film
bopping along fairly well, though
it does seem to drag in spots, I
wasn't really bothered by that too
muchas this enchanting little ditty
kept my attention throughout its
duration - and that’s no minor ac-
complishment. Bill’shumor wasa
lot more subtle than his usuatin-
your-face style; yet, I found that
refreshing and itmade the material
seem e¢ven funnier. Andie
MacDowell was great as the
Sweeter-than-sugar Rita - her fam-
ily lives in my hometown of
Asheville, so you know I had to
give it up for my homegirl. She
knew exactly when to stand back
and give the spotlight to Bill and
when to hop right in there with
him. Kudos to you Andie! Overall
I’dsay this isa great little PG-rated
flick and I would recommend it to
anyone (namely y’all) desiring to
See a nice relaxing comedy.
