A Well-fought Fight

Once again the democratic process has had its annual
hearing on the Davidson campus and has left behind a
new set of leaders to control student activity for the com-
ing vear.

We would first like to extend our congratulations to
the victorious candidates. If they prove to be as excellent
in office as their campaign promises have led us to sus-
pect. the college should be in good hands.

To overuse an overused phrase, the proof is in the
pudding. We would certainly like to see the proposed ac-
tion put into effect as soon as possible, as advertised.

The campaigns themselves also deserve comment.

In an election vear such as this. it would be easy for
the campaign to become very ugly. There was no single
clear-cut issue in the campaign. All but one office was
contested by onlv two candidates. if at all.

In the absence of a real issue, the campus finally focus-
ed around the leadership potential of the candidates them-
selves. what they were rather than what they stood for.

It is to the credit of the candidates that they did not
allow the campaign to become a dirty one. Literature that
was distributed emphasized the positive aspects of the in-
dividual and did not attempt to run down the qualifications
of the opponent.

In a race over personalities. we had the inevitable en-
dorsements for both presidential candidates. Such endorse.
ments themselves marked a radical departure from David-
son politics of the past. But again thev emphasized the
positive aspects of the candidates.

To the winners, the spoils . . . and good luck.

Winter Of Our Discontent

~ There are few surprises. if any, in the most recent
report to come out of an SGA Senate investigative com-
mittee.

The newest report. concerned with the reactions of
the freshman class to the new social system and the gen-
eral social atmosphere at Davidson, has found that, in
essence. freshmen are dissatisfied and unhappy.

So what else is new? °

Freshmen at Davidson, and especially those from
public high schools where girls are a part of life, have
traditionally found the social life on campus sour, frus-

trating. and depressing. But then so have sophomores,
juniors. and seniors.

A brief survey of past issues of THE DAVIDSONIAN
shows that in almost every winter recent history. the
freshman class has expressed its discontent, rumors of
mass transfers have run wild, and tales of social trials
and tribulations have been commonplace. In the end, how-

ever. the majority of transfers are by those that can’t cut
it academically.

This is not to write off the social problems at David-
son. however. for they are very real indeed, and fresh-
men, not vet acclimated to the sterility, feel it most bitter-
y.

The new social system is not working, and everyone
knows it. The structure is faulty, the houses are less than
cordial. and the freshmen are understandably giving up,
and no relief appears in sight. Furthermore, with the de-
molition of the Union this summer, no center for those
outside the Patterson Court social system will be available.

_ Therefore, we urge the administration to begin consid-
ering a radical shift in the present structure. Perhaps “
more intense assignment of freshmen for more continuous
meals would be beneficial. Perhaps some assignments of
larger numbers of freshmen together would help. Per-
haps some financial incentive offered to the most success-
ful cooperating clubs would aid the situation.

_ In any event. the time has come for some definite
action concerning Davidson’s floundering social system.
We're too close to monasticism now to make any more
mistakes in our social life.

Jackson, Coalition Dream
Of Future Art, Exchange

“| dream things that never
were and say why not.”
Robert F. Kennedy

Academics are for men who
think. Education is for men who
dream. Tucked away in an ob-
scure corner of this campus is
Lingle Manor. It is here that
men are daring to do more than
think. Men are dreaming and
these dreams are becoming
reality.

On the left side of a rather
drab hallway in Lingle Manor
is the office studio of Herb
Jackscn, an art professor and
an artist. Herb had a dream,
a dream of a national! print and
drawing contest at Davidson.
He ‘jumped in head first” aft-
er his dream and now that
dream is reality.

On March 19 The Davidson
National Print and Drawing
Competition will open in Stowe
Galleries. in its first year this
competition is probably one of
the top five of its kind in the
U. S. It is the first national
competition in the Carolinas.
Somehow it surprises me that
most of Davidson is still wun-
aware of its existence.

The Davidson National is a
one man production. It was con-
ceived and developed by Herb
Jackson. He does all the work
by himself. He has an average
of 50 responses a day. He an-
swers them himself. He com-
piled the mailing list of artists.
He wrote the perspectus.

Amazing that one man should
do all the work for such an
exciting program. Not really.

Herb calls he Davidson Na-
tional “show conceived by an
artist, for artists.” The reason
for this is the nature of the
prizes. Instead of having a first
prize. there are four special
purchase awards of $400 each.
There is other money for pur-
chase of works at the artist’s
price. All works purchased will
become part of the Davidson
collection.

The dream of Herb Jackson
does not stop here. A museum
to house the collection is in the
near future. It is something to
hope for and to work towards,
and it shall not be a dream
easily realized.

The arts are becoming a real-
ity at Davidson. It seems tragic
that it has come so late at a
supposed liberal arts college.
It is here now, and I can only
encourage those interested in
art to Support the art program,
to help it grow, and to make
art a leader in the educational
reformation of Davidson Col-
lege.

Opposite the office of Herb
Jackson is the building space
allotted to the Black Student
Coalition. The Coalition, made
up of Davidson’s token attempt
at social relevency (1.5% of the
Student population, moves
quietly and effectively in this
white refuge.

These men are dreamers also,
though a bit more pragmatic in
their approach. They are spon-
soring a program that would al-
Jow Davidson students to ex-
perience a different -life style.

This program is a jointly
sponsored student exchange pro-

gram with Johnson C. Smith
University. Two weekends, Jan.
20-23 and Feb. 3-6, are the de-
signated dates for the exchange.
On the first weekend ten David-
son students will journey to
Smith to be sponsored there by
ten hosts. Ten Smith students
witl come to Davidson and ten
students here will act as spon-
sors. On the second weekend
the sponsors and visitors will
exchange roles.

The exchange includes attend-
ing Friday classs with the spon-
sor and tagging with the spon-
sor in his various activities
throughout the weekend. Ron
Gibson, chairman of the Coali-
tion, sees the program as ‘an
opportunity to view a different
life style. to be involved in a
different social environment.”

For such an exciting opport-
unity, 1 could envision a con-
stant stream of students going
to Will Terry’s office to sign up.
However, I do ‘not. Davidson
students fear leaving their com-
placent and safe white world
and venturing into a different
type of society and experience.
especially that of the black so-
ciety and experience. I can just
imagine the number of students
who are a bit fearful when they

LETTER

have to drive through one of
Charlotte's scgregated black
neighborhoods.

The opportunity vo participate
in this exchange program should
not be passed up. The learning
experience gained by participat-
ing in the exchange will far sur-
pass the sterility of the David-
son classroom. Perhaps the ex-
change will provide some Dav-
idson students with a small in-
sight into what it means to be
black in America

Yes, Davidson has a few
dreamers, and Davidson is clut-
tered with too many thinkers.
A friend in Raleigh observed
that Davidson is “a cozy, safe,
complacent, and totally unim-
ginative environment.” 1 fear
there is more than a grain of
truth in that statement.

Davidson has a great poten-
tial to change. There are men
at Davidson who dare to dream.
Though they are few, and the
odds are heavily against them,
they reach out to touch the ex-
citing. the novel, and the im-
aginative. There is a small can-
dle of hope burning in a dark,
stale community of thinkers.
This candle of hope is held by
those who dare to ask, why not?

Rolland Rejects
Guest House Site

To The Editor:

The recent announcement of
intent on the part of the Col-
lege Union to annex the Guest
House must leave the disinter-
ested observer at best confused.

It left me dumbfounded. It is
a shocking thing indeed to find
the Union, just at a time when
the tumor is about to be re-
moved, in such a curious state
of metastasis.

Yes, it is a sad thing when
such a delightfully irreverent
piece of campus architecture as
the Guest House is to be over-
run in the path of such a hide-
ous malignancy.

If an excuse for this outrage
is not to. be found, the rather
scandalous reason behind it is
at least reasonably clear.

The Union, long denied its
coveted position as center of
the campus, has takeh the event
of its eviction as occasion for
the acquisition of this role by
violence.

It will simply replace some
useful institution: the laundry
or the Guest House or the Cham-
bers dining hall.

You may object here to the
word replace. You may say,
“The Guest House patrons will
be housed under the stadium
(How strange! In a $10 million
underground apartment com-
plex or in the ticket booth?

Or perhaps on the ruins of
the handball courts.) or in Rich-
ardson dormitory (Very well if
you mean the girls can sleep
with their dates—why single out
Richardson?

On the other hand I suspect
that some official visitors, par-
ents, alumni. etc. might find the
sexual tastes of their new room.
mates somewhat disarming.) or
in the Gray House if a wom-
en's dorm is built (Sometime in
the next 15 years. Meanwhile
the girls might as well sleep in
the union director's office.)

‘ht is surprising, in fact, that
the “committee for investiga,
tion of possible sites for the
Union” did mot recommend the
whole of Chambers.

Classes could certainly be
held out of doors where the
fresh air and exhilarating fluc-
tuations in weather might stim-
ulate the intellects of gifted
Davidson naturalists.

‘And what a splendid, central-
ly located. functional structure
with adequate space for all the
Student organizations for years
to come.

Yes, the Union is spreading.
diffusing, digging in for a long
siege: and what are we to do?

Well, if chemotherapy, radia-
tion, prayer, etc. fail, I recom-
mand that the small, shrine-like
fountain on the front lawn of
Chambers be furnished with a
desk, a telephone, an hundred-
dollar-judges-chair, and three
secretaries, preferably well en-
dowed: be walled up: and upon
it on all four sides be affixed
a sign which reads:

“Director of Placement, Di-
rector of the College Union.
and a magician quite  possi-
bly...” ’
