Question

of the Week

There

has been much discussion
recently about damage to College
property. Last Friday Fred Stair
appealed to the student body for
suggestions on to with
the situation now and in the future.
One plan brought up was a rever-
sion to the old
tem. Under this plan a damage fee
would be charged each student at
the beginning of the year and after
the costs of damage to the college
property had deducted, the
fund was “pro rated” among the
students about commencement time.
The question this week is:
favor a return to the “Damage fee”
system and if so what fee would
you suggest? Have you any sugges-
tions about this situation?”

Tom Magill, Senior:

I do not favor return to the
damage fee system because I think
the ones who actually do the dam-
age should pay for it, not the whole
student body. who has to
get his pleasure by destruc-
tive means should be willing to pay
for it just the same as he would a
picture show or some other enter-
tainment.

The collection of this
ment fee, which the destructive stu-
dents should pay, now becomes the

should be glad to admit
this weakness and pay for his own
entertainment.

student

Pete Marchant, Senior:

Having been painfully separated
from $24.23 of my hard-earned es-
sential lucre, and being over-bur-
dened in my ity as Presid
of the Student Fine Paying Associa-
tion, I would like to go on record
as being heartily in favor of paying
a damage fee at the beginning of
the year rather than being undress-
ed financially in the middle of the
semester. Being very partial, on the
subject I much prefer to pay $2.00
at the beginning of each year in-
stead of $24.23 in the middle of the
semester. Besides, some of the dam-
age fee is returned. There is no
hope for the other.

t

Sherrard Rice, Senior:

Speaking theoretically, I don’t
favor a return to the old damage
fee because it tends to become no-
thing but a blanket assessment, and
is apt to make the destruction of
college property seem like a minor

offence. But since we have the
problem constantly recurring and
must handle it somehow, I can

think of no better solution than a
$5.00 damage fee, paid in at the
beginning of the freshmam year and
refunded when we graduate or
I urge this provision, how-
that every effort be made to
deduct the cost of damages from
the fees of those who caused it, and
not from the student body as a
whole.

Phil Edwards, Junior:

Since the damage fee system has
proved effectivé in the past, and
thus far no other plan seems evi-
dent, I think the plan is most plaus-
ible. This system seems rather un-
necessary and bothersome, but
when such damages as have occur-
red in the past return, the faculty
would have the damage fee to fall
back on; and there would be no
such complications as we have at

leave.
ever.

present. The usual two dollar per
year fee would be sufficient.
Gray Hunter, Junior:

I am definitely against the re-
turn of the damage fee for two rea-
sons. First, such an assessment
would not bring to an end student
riots, fact, it would encourage
them; and second, because the fee
would not bring to an end these dis-
plays of vandalism, I see no reason
why the innocent members of the
student body should pay for some-
thing they didn’t do.

in

George Milne, Junior:

A return to the “damage fee” sys-
tem would in no way stop malicious
damage to college property. Not
until the students who do this are
fixed with the sole responsibility
of their actions, and those who in
no way condone the breakage take
it upon themselves to suppress and
discourage the outbreaks, will the
problem be solved. A “damage fee”
only spreads the cost caused by a
few to fall upon many who had no

part.
Bobby Williams, Sophomore:
No, I think that the Davidson

Student Body is old enough and
responsible enough to accept the
obligations which it incurs. Our life
here is preparing us for the world
outside, and there we are résponsi-
ble for our actions. We must get
used to paying for our own neglig-
ence in taking care of our commu-

nity.
