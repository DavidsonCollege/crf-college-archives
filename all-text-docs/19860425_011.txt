defendant the benefit of the doubt, to the ex-
tent that such doubt exists. But these attacks
are so personal, against members of the
Council itself. If there are flaws in the
Codes, we should all talk about them and
change things. Fine. But the Council is not
a group of headhunters who feed on inno-
cent people. Defendants are innocent until
proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt.
We're all friends here.

Argument

To the Editors:
It’s ashame when a writer takes the time

to research a topic, present a reasonable
analysis, and support his conclusion, only
to find a response that is not researched, not
reasonable, and poorly supported. Two
weeks ago Tim Brown wrote an article
suggesting the US improve its Special Op-
erations Forces because they are necessary
and because they need improvement.
Brown supported his argument with clear
facts and a good case study — the disastrous
rescue mission attempted in Iran during the
Carter Administration. Following that at-
tempt to save the American hostages, we all
learned the screens on the helicopters used
in the mission were not the right gauge to
keep sand out of the engines. The mission
took place in the desert. There is sand in the

Ay,

desert. With respect to those who died in the
brave effort, Brown and I are concerned
that our secret forces are not as effective as
they should be.

Last week Donald Kropp responded to
Brown's article by mocking Brown’s dic-
tion, claiming Brown doesn’t know what
he’s talking about, and using logic that
would amuse a troglodyte. Kropp said
Brown can't know what he’s talking about
because secret forces are secret and because
Brown has never been to Airborne School,
“Special Ops” (ooooh, the lingo) exercises,
and Iran or Grenada. First, secret forces are
not absolutely secret. If one researches, as
Brown clearly has, one can find out a great
deal. Second, to suggest an American

should not consider himself sufficiently
knowledgeable to comment on America’s
military simply because he has not been in
the military is profane and absurd in its im-
plications. Third, I know people who were
im both Iran and Grenada and from what
I've heard, Brown's moderate recommen-
dation is well-founded.

And as for logic, listen to this. Dig up
last week's Davidsonian if you don’t be-
lieve Kropp put this in print: “Special Oper-
ations training is extremely well-planned
and organized. It has to be; real lives are at
risk.” Does the absurdity of that logic speak
for itself, or must I mention that therefore
Vietnam was extremely well organized?
