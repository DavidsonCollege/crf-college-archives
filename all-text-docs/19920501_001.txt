Honor Council Boots Harrassing Punk;
Feeling of Community Wholly Restored!

By H. J. Heinz

The Davidson Honor Council
met last Thursday evening in Phi
Hall to hear a case involving..a
Code of Responsibility violation.
Joe Schmozowsky, the defendant,
was charged witha violation of the
newly and quictly installed Sec-
tion IV of the Code Of Responsi-
bility. Specifically he was accused
of threatening and/or insulting
another student in the hallways of
the Chambers Building.

The trial began at 6:00 p.m.
and lasted until 2:30 a.m. on Fri-
day morning. Shmozowsky was
represented by John Holmes and
Jim Beam. He was prosecuted by
John Patton and Mimi Plauché.
The Court consisted of the same
people as the last seven cases, and

was steered by John Howell, chair-

man. Matt Bumstead, the secre-

tary, worked the tape recorder.
When asked how he pleaded

to the charge, the defendant re-

sponded, “Guilty, I guess.” - The
first witness the defense called ‘to
the stand was Bharat Krishnamur-
thy. Bharat testified that during
the day of April 4 atapproximately
11:10 a.m., Schmozowsky was
walking down the stairs in the
Union side of Chambers.

Bharat was immediately be- -

hind Schmozowsky. There was,

_ according to Bharat, an obstruc-

tion of some sort on the stairs in
front of Schmozowsky, and Joe
responded to this obstruction by
complaining to the person respon-

‘sible for the obstruction and walk-

ing around the obstruction/person.
The next witness the defense called
was Edwin Edwards, a “close
friend” of the defendant. Edwards
testified that Joe was a “gentle,
sensitive guy, always very friendly,
and held the. deepest undcrstand-
ing for persons different than him-
self’ (Schmozowsky). The defense
then rested.

After a fifteen minute collu-
sion, the Honor Council reconve-
ned. The prosecution opened their
case against the defendant by read-
ing the statement for which
Schmozowsky is accused of mak-
ing. “Move it, lard ass”, he alleg-
edly said to A. Hugh Jass in the
halls of Chambers on April 14, at

Davidson to Update CHAL System:
The Damn Thing ‘ll Be Able to Talk!

By Freelove Upthumpa

Leland Park, director of the
EH. Little Library at Davidson
Collge unveiled the prototype fora
new computer system which will
update, the Computerized Help At
Little (CHAL) system currently in
place. The improved computers
will each include a voice synthe-
sizer and the entire system will be
known as the CHAL 9000.

The idea stems from the film
“2001--A Space Odyssey,” which
depicts a spaceship equipped with
a HAL 9000 talking computer
system. In the film, the HAL 9000

isanextremely advanced machine
which, at times, seems quite hu-
man. The new CHAL 9000 is part
of Davidson’s continuing salute to
Professor Emeritus and College
Archivist Chalmers Davidson,
who, according to college offi-
cials, also seems quite human.
The new computers are de-

signed to proffer a bit of Professor
-Davidson’s personality. At Wed-

nesday’s demonstration, when
Park inquired after books about
Gender Studies, the computer

. muttered angrily, and then listed
works by Phyllis Schlafly end

Robert Bly. When asked for titles
referring to the ante bellum south,

the computer graciously offerred .

brary, briefly reviewed the content Tf

of each, and even threw in a few
friendly anecdotes about “them
good old days.”

The demonstration had to be

. ended after a student asked the

CHAL 9000 for books about the
Beta ThetaPifratemity. Thecrowd
stood aghastas the computer, after

the lawn.

And he said, “You know, the
first time many people get stoned
they think nothing’s happened---I
guess they expect that the walls
should turn purple. As for me, I
saw newly, yet saw nothing new.
I was aware of what was always
there, but had been held from my
awareness: the subtle echoes of the
room’s acooustics, the quick con-
fusion of thoughts and feelings
flashing through my mind. Laugh-
ter welled within me. And I be-
