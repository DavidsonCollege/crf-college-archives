By Trent Stevens

Joey Manibo represented the
Virgin Islands in the tennis com-
petition of the Caribbean and
Central American Games this past
fall in Mexico City.

But Manibo’s talents and aspi-
rations extend far beyond the ten-
nis court. This Davidson psychol-
ogy major plans to win the struggle
to become a doctor in straight sets.

Manibo is a St. Croix native
who attended three years of board-
ing school in Fort Lauderdale be-
fore deciding tocome to Davidson.
Tennis has been aconstantat all of
the schools that he has attended
since the age of 10. He claims that

tennis is “like a therapy for me.”

As a member of Davidson’s
tennis team, Manibo practices and
conditions about two-and-a-quar-
ter hours per day, five days a week.
“There seems to be a lot of enthu-
siasm,” Manibo claims about this
year’s team. “The coach (Jeff
Frank) seems to be really satis-
fii

Manibo’s commitment to ten-
nis is shared by his younger sister,
astudentat Louisiana’s Centenary
College and considered to be the
best women’s tennis player of the
Virgin Islands.

Manibo’s involvement in the
Caribbean and Central American

Games began when.the president
of the Virgin Islands Tennis Asso-
ciation called him to inquire if he
was interested in trying to qualify.
Inthe Virgin Islands, Manibo says
that he was always second or third
in the junior tennis rankings. He
qualified in a match in Miami.
From November 19th through
December 3rd, the games were held
in the Mexican capital, forcing
Manibo to miss a week and a half
of classes at Davidson.

But the games did not go as
well for the Virgin Islands as
Manibo had expected. Mexico,
Cuba, and Puerto Rico were the
three strongest teams. Manibo

Persian Exchange Student's
Family Attacked By Kurds

By Meredith Hammons

1915

The entire student body was
scheduled to attend a Laymen’s
Convention in Charlotte. The
Laymen’s Movement was an or-
ganization of lay members of the
Church. and involved men in a
myriad of professions who were
interested in.pursuing the work of
the Church.

The group only convened once
every two years and the opportu-
nity to go to the convention was
considered a privilege. The fac-
ulty strongly urged all students to
attend.

Persian exchange student,
William Sayad, received a tele-
gram from Secretary William
Bryan _ informing him that his
family was safe.

He had been concerned since
his relatives were living in

Uramiah, Persia; and the Muslim
Kurds were raiding that city. He

also received word that his family
had relocated to Tiflis, Russia.

1955
Students observed University
Christian Mission Week. This
week was sponsored by the
Davidson College YMCA and hte
National University Christian
Mission. The objectives of the

week were to present the Christian
faith as a basis for social concern
and action especially in the areas
of Southern racial tensions, South-
em economics problems, _ the
South’s role in the world commu-
nity,-and Christian role in politics.
During this week, five religious
and political leaders (Col. Francis
Miller, Dr. Addison Letich, Dr.
Waldo Beach, Dr. Lester G.
McAllister, and Rev. Harry E.
Smith) spoke in classrooms, per-
sonal conferences, afternoon semi-
nars, and bull sessions. The movie
“Pinky” which depicted racial
problems was also shown.

Davidson lost 40 men after the
firstsemester, lowering enrollment
to 805. The sophomore class lost
20 menand the freshman class, 16.
Of the 40 men, 34 left involuntar-
ily. This was a “mortality rate” of
4.5% , as compared to the usual
3%.

relates that ‘Mexico had the Davis
Cup in doubles, and we had to play
them.” Although he lost in singles
matches to Venezuela and Aruba,
he claims that he enjoyed the com-
petition. He adds, “I was justhappy
being there.” This August, if he
qualifies, he hopes to join his sister
in representing his homeland in
the Pan American Games, which
will be held in Cuba.

Manibo. says he likes the
“closeness” of Davidson, but he
admits that he used to be frustrated
by the academic prowess of other
students. He now says that “You
just work for yourself. You satisfy
yourself.” This spring he plans to

take the MCAT, and:he is.consid-
ering specializing in pediatrics in
medical school. --

But Manibo’s time is not allo-
cated to just studying and tennis.
Although he isa member of Kappa
Sigma, Manibo admits that he is
not very socially outgoing, prefer-
ring instead to engage in other
sports, such as windsurfing.

Manibo does notplan tennisas
a career, and for now he plans
continue playing at Davidson. “I’m
very. happy here,” he confides.
“T’ve been able to play tennis and
I’ve been able to get a good educa-
tion.” He will continue to focus on
these goals, he said.

If you have spent time in the
Union, Verdie Barringer’s
friendly smile has probably
greeted you. Now she has reason
to grin even wider, for her poetry
recently received national recog-
nition. In a contest sponsored by
the World of Poetry, her poem
“The Flute” won honorable men-
tion.

“T was excited!” was how she
described her emotions upon
learning her work was selected
from more than 3,000 entries.
“My certificate is on the wall at
home”.

Barringer began writing po-
etry about four years ago, about
the same time she started working
for Davidson College. She sees
this as more than just coincidence
because for her the two serve the

same purpose. Just as her clean-

does her poetry. Both allow her
to give something to others.
Likewise, the college com-
munity has played a vital role in
helping Barringer to develop her
talents. She is quick to credit
Union Director William Brown
with encouraging her to write
during her breaks and giving her
a “helping hand”. Ruth Pittard,
Program Coordinator, has also
provided assistance and Dr. Hol-
land and Dr. Abbott-of the Eng-
lish Department critique her work
and offer suggestions. Students
also influence Barringer to go
forward with her poetry, in fact it
was a student that pushed her to
