—, Romances capture schola

By MERIDETH DURDEN
Staff Writer

“Ideally, I’d like to do a study of
more active heroines, heroines who
have some gumption.’’ Maureen
Boulton pushes back her thick red
hair and discusses her writing inter-
ests. Currently she is working on a
thesis for St. Hilda’s College of the
University of Oxford, ‘“‘Lyric Inser-
tions in Narrative Fiction in the
Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centur-
ies”’.

The paper requires the study of
about forty French romances. These
romances, ranging from 350 lines to
6,000 pages, are all narratives with
lyric insertions, ‘‘which means it’s
like Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire
movies, where someone suddenly
bursts out into song,”’ explains the
curly-haired Dr. Boulton. In her fifty
thousand word thesis Ms. Boulton
analyzes these insertions and how
they are related to the narrative
structure.

With a B.A. from the College of
New Rochelle, an M.A. and Ph.D.
from the University.of Pennsylvania,
and a consuming interest in French
literature, Ms. Boulton is indeed a
“literary critic’’.

Her.husband, a historian in his
second year of teaching at Davidson,
sits across from her against a back-
drop of books. Dr. Boulton speaks of
the International Courtly Literary
Society to which they both belong.
Both husband and wife will read
papers when the society convenes in
April.

Dr. Boulton, a Canadian who was
educated at the Universities of Tor-
onto and Pennsylvania and at St.
John’s College of Oxford, studies how
the readers of courtly love literature
tried to imitate the art of the
romances they read. “It’s rather like
someone trying to imitate James
Bond,’’ Dr. Boulton alludes, as he
tries to explain the problems of
emulating court culture. Ms. Boulton

is preparing u paper on a French story
that, as she explains between sips of
tea, is almost “‘anti-court culture’.
The reading of papers is not new to
either Dr. Boulton. Both husband and
wife belong to the Davidson Faculty
Research Group. The latter consists
of about twenty Davidson professors
and their spouses. About once a
month, the group convenes and a
member reads a paper. For example,
Dr. Maydole introduced his idea of a
“Modal Logic Proof for the Existence
of God”’ to this group. And it was to
this group that Ms. Boulton read the
introduction to her thesis.
Although the thesis employs most
of Ms. Boulton’s time, writing is not
her only interest. Backed by a New
York State Teaching Certificate, Ms.
Boulton has applied for a position
with a college or university language
department. In her field of speciali-
zation, French medieval literature,
there are nine teaching positions in
the country.

Bert Houle and Sophie Wibaux, a
mime duo from the LorettopHilton
Repertory Theatre of St. Louis will be
in residency at Davidson College
Monday through Wednesday, Feb-
ruary 14-16.

The duo will perform in Hodson
) |Hall Monday at 7 pm and Tuesday in
Love Auditorium at 8 pm as well as
hold an open workshop Wednesday at
2:30 pm in the Union.

Houle and Wibaux developed
strong mime technique at the Eteine
Decroux Mime School in Paris.
They’ve enhanced what is normally
accepted as mime with an innovative
style that dramatizes myths, com-

‘“‘What is amazing is how the
players manage to apply the concrete
language of movement and gesture to |
the realm of ideas, tense drama or]
philosophical investigation,’’ accord-
ing to Giles M. Fowler of the Kansas
City Times.

“In the second act of pantomimes, |
Houle and Wibaux prove to have anfj
equally mature sense of the comic,”
he continued. :

“What these two young talented
mimes offer is a total theatrical
experience,” said Larry Lusk of the
Lincoln Evening Journal.

facination

At the recent convention of the
Modern Language Association, Ms.
Boulton was interviewed by Carlton
College and Stanford University. The
latter interview was especially satis-
fying, ‘‘as in that league it is
flattering just to be spoken to!,’’ she
smiles. However, she currently con-
centrates on reading a romance a day
for her thesis. And should anyone

" want to do an Independent Study on

medieval literature, she would be

delighted to oblige.
