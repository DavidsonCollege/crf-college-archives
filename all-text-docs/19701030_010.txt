Dwyer Critiques Works.

_ On Anthro

By - “power Pesci
Staff Weiter

Miss. Geraldine Dwyer, a
member ‘of ‘the Sociology
Départment at Davidson,
spoke’ to: an open meeting
of the Philapthropic Society
last Monday night.

She discussed two recent
books, “‘The Naked Ape’’ by.
Desmond Morris and ‘‘Afri-
can Genesis’’ by Robert
Audrey;~which have proved
immensely pepular with the
general public.

Miss Dwyer, a_ graduate
of Hunter College in New
York with graduate work at
the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, had

disparaging words: for both |

books. She said that neither
is considered a fine work by
anthropologists, which she
is, even though she teaches
sociology.

(Miss Dwyer began her lec-
ture with a brief explanation
of anthropology, which she
defined as ‘‘the study of

man;” and then she listed .

its four major subdivisions:
linguistics, prehistoric arch-
eology, ethnology, and phy-

wi

: : sical suitecicay

She then’ began the major
portione of her. talk, discus-
sion: and criticism of the
two books. She said that
both writers simply gave
the. public what they want-
ed — sex*and violence. She
said the two writers ‘‘bend
the facts to fit the public
diet.”

Her harshest criticism was
for ‘‘The Naked Ape,”’ which
she said had the most inac-
curacies. ;
rors is statement that man
went through some kind of
monkey stage, which has

been proved virtually im-
possible.

(Morris further appeals to
~to the egoism of his readers: iE
by insinuating that “Ameri-
cans and Westerners are on

If you want to console
your psyche and spend a
couple of hours in pure’ es-

world of woe, go see ‘‘The

One night at a cocktail
party, Jack meets Catherine
(musi¢ sounds, -lights twin-
kle) and the two of them
exit for a few drinks. At a
wild discotheque, they | run
into Myrna Loy and return
with her to her Long Island
estate. °

There, Jack fences: with
‘Myrna's - wacky husband
(Charlés Boyer), and the

four of them pass the night
spewing comments on the
transitory state of life and
the need for .true ove.
Well: by now, Jack and
Catherine know they've each
found their own true love.
They decide to elope after
a ten hour engagement.
Then comes the proverbial
twist in the .plot. As we've

all “known, for about sixty- °

minutes, . Catherine's
husband is Jack's employ-
er.

Bevan added that he hop-
ed fraternities would remain
on campus. “I hope they
will be elastic enough to
accept the new basis of af-
filiation,” he said.

Bevan was then asked why

-the board -of trustees made

the provision that fraterni-
ties could not eat off cam-
pus. He replied that this had
been tried before and was
unsuccessful,

“There
two reasons for this.
there is the question of con-
trol. If fraternities are off
Campus, we will lose the
sense of community desire-
able. in this college.

“Secondly there is the
matter of economics. When
this was tried before it was
not financially | successful,”
he. said.

Bevan said that it may be
possible for fraternities to
go off campus, but he doubt-
ed whether the national
chapter would invest its

‘money without knowing the

outcome of the situation.

Regarding: the financial
prospects of ‘setting up this
new system, Bevan § said,
“The college will go to any
expense to institute this so-
cial program.”

Some students were con-
cerned about the active role
taken by Presidential Assist-
ant Peter: H. Hobbie. Bevan
had said that although the
meetings of the committee
were open, only those on the
committee could take an ac:
tive role.

Those who wanted to on
serve may do-so.
Yet some who aveandiea

the _financial—subcommittee

meeting. noted that Hobbie
had taken a ‘‘very active
role” in explaining the in-

tent’ of the recommenda-
tions of the board of trus-
tees.

It was also revealed that
Hobbie is serving as_ secre-
tary of the committee.

Among these er.,

the ‘mainstream’ of the
evolutionary line and that
those considered less ad-
vanced.“are off- that main-.
stream. Miss Dwyer further °
said that Morris uses West-
ern nofms in sex as correct
and .brands all others as de-
viates while, in fact, West-
ern man is in a minority.

‘Miss Dwyer said that as
one finished ‘“‘The Naked
Ape,” he is supposed to stand
up and thank. God that he
is an American —.a Phari-
see rather than a_ publican.

The speaker’ considered
“African Genesis'’ a much .
better written and docu:

mented, book: than Morris’.

She commended -him for ~
getting one fact right —~

‘that Africa is man’s birth-

place, although she disagre-
ed with some of his other
conclusions . about apes,
chimpanzees, and the idea
that all tools are really
weapons.

Miss Dwyer did not re-
commend either book as a
good one on such questions
as evolution, aggression, vi-
olence, and man. When ask-
ed what she would recom-
mend, she promised those
assembled that she would
post a list of books outside
the Alumni Office Tuesday
morning.

After a brief pause to al-
low guests to leave, the So-
ciety held a regular busi-
ness meeting.
