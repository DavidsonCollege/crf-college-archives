Davidson Shines In Defeat

It all came to a close Sat-
urday night in Raleigh.
Davidson's dream of a trip
to Los Angeles and a shot at
the really big boys was shat-
tered when the ‘Cats came

out on the short end of a
70-66 decision against North
Carolina,

In the intensely fought con-
test, the closeout of a mag-
nificent weekend of basket-
ball. Davidson put an end to
another dream. They proved

Saturday Night,
Lefty Was Great

By DALE GIBSON
in The Daily Tar Heel
(UNC-CH)

Perhaps the classic state-
ment made at the Eastern
Regionals was this one: ‘‘I
really don’t have much to
say.”

Not profound, you say? Not
anything big, you figure?

Well, stop and consider it
came from Lefty Driesell,
that colorful and vociferous
coach of the Davidson Wild-
cats.

He was a gentleman. He
accepted the Cardlina defeat
with composure and humil-
ity.

There he was, standing in
front of the legion of sports-
writers and sportscasters, in
his blazing red sports jack-
et.

“We arc disappointed that
we lost. We think our kids
played a fine game,”’ Driesell
said with a hurt look on his
face.

Then came the ultimate.
The statement least likely to
be heard from Lefty Drie-
sell.

“We got beat tonight by the
third best team in the coun-
try and they might be the
best before it’s over. We hope
they go all the way.”

You see Driesell is a char-
acter. Cassius Clay is a char-
acter and so is Dizzy Dean.
They all tell people how
great thcy are. Diz and Cas-
sius can back themselves up.
Diz was a great pitcher and
Clay is probably one of the
best fighters ever to corral
himself inside the ropes.

And Lefty's baseball team.
Well it's very good. Great?
Decide that for yourself.

The fact is that Lefty was

ready to praise the team that
beat him and he stood up for
his boys. ;

‘I'm not but 35 and I'll be
up there in the finals one day
and I think some of these
kids wil! be there,”’ he said.

You see, all year, Lefty had
a dream. He dreamed about
the California sun and the
fun he and his boys would
have on the slats in the LA
Sports Arena.

Well. it's over now. He had
set three goals for his team.
First, win the Southern Con-
ference Championship. Sec-
ond, get back in the top ten.
Third, go to the national fi-
nals.

He came close.

He had the desire— a de-

Doug Cook
Sore, But
Improving

Sophomore Doug Cook, who
suffered a “hip pointer” in
Friday night’s game with Co-
lumbia. is showing signs of
gradunl improvement.

Cook, the team's second
leading scorer and rebound-
er, missed most of the Co-
lumbia game and the entire
UNC game as a result of the
injury, suffered in a collision
with Columbia's Roger Wa-
leszek.

Cook noted that he was
still hampered in his move-
ment by the bruise, but he
said he thought it was im-
proving.

sire he instilled in his team.
They were ready for the
Southern Conference Tourna-
ment. They were ready for
the Eastern Playoffs and by
golly, they were ready for
the Eastern Regionals. They
were beaten there though—
by a better team and he said
$0.

After the game Saturday
night, the obviously pained
Davidson players watched as
the Tar Heels accepted the
winners’ trophy.

Driesell said, “Yes, I'm
taking the loss hard. The
boys are taking it hard and I
want them to because we
were shooting for the nation-
al championship.

Saturday night, it all be-
came apparent what Lefty
Driesell is. More of the same
can be expected next season.

He is a man who took an
athletically poor little college
and built it into a basketball
giant. He had a dream and
the desire to go along with
it.

But he’s a character. He
opens his mouth a little too
much. He tells people just
how great his team is and
most folks don’t like this—
including me until Saturday
night when the real Lefty

beyond question that Wildcat
basketball compares with the
calibre of ball played in the
Atlantic Coast Conference.

The highly partisan UNC
crowd found itself with little
tu say in the first half of the
championship game with the
scorned Davidson team.

The ‘Cats put together a
vicious defense, a disciplined
offense and an overwhelming
rebounding display to domi-
nate the half and give the
Tar Heels something to think
about during the intermis-
sion.

The Heels were a better
team in the second half.
Their defense was tighter
and their board play was
stronger. They were able
to get their running offense
going, and it was clear that
Davidson would have to
fight to maintain their lead.
Not once in the entire game

did the ‘Cats stop fighting.
They fought back to cut a
nine point deficit to two
points with 18 seconds left to,
play.

But they could not pull it
off. UNC had won another in
the homestretch. It was a
hard loss for the Wildcats to
take.

Tar Heel class had outlast-
ed the ‘Cat determination.
All-America Larry Miller had
sparked UNC's big rally.
Charlie Scott had calmly
played a great game. Rusty.
Clark played a terrific tour-
nament, good enough to earn
the Outstanding Player
Award.

For the Wildcats, Mike Ma-
loy, team leader throughout
the season, earned a spot
on the all-tournament team.
Dave Moser played his usual
relaxed and effective floor
game.

Jerry Kroll played an im-
portant role in the ‘Cats’
early lead over the Tar Heels.

it’s all over now, for this year, anyway. The num-

bers on the scoreboard Saturday night seemed like a
poor excuse to end a great season, but those are the
rules. Yet, for us the players, it’s hard to believe the
season is over. ’'m sure the other players, like myself,
catch themselves asking what time practice is every
day this week.

Last weekend in Raleigh was a succession of hope

and despair. We arrived in town on Thursday afternoon
and had a hard workout that evening in‘the coliseum.
There was an air of caution and confidence during the
practice which was to stay with us through the end
Saturday night. We stayed at the Statler Hilton Motel,
which had everything from a “by appointment only”
barber shop to a private night club in the basement.
But unlike some of our other road trips we were always
thinking about the tournament, about Columbia, and
especially about Carolina.
Against Columbia on Friday night we played well
even though they had a chance to end the tournament
for us with two seconds left. Some of the Davidson
players told me I should put Bruce Metz (the Columbia
player who missed the foul shot with two seconds re-
maining) on my all-American skin team, but I couldn’t
because he played a good game before that incident.

The calling of two successive timeouts before
Metz’s foul shot turned out to be a smart tactic despite
the statement by Columbia’s coach that it wasn’t in
very good taste. To answer this, I can only quote Lefty
who said, “if it is in the rules, then it’s legal and it’s
fair. Columbia could have done the same to us if the
situation had arisen.”

Friday's victory over Columbia brought us both
hope and despair. Now we had a chance at North
Carolina but we also lost Doug Cook who injured him-
self diving after a loose ball. The importance of this
loss is illustrated by the way Doug blocked Columbia’s
7-1 Dave Newmark’s layup before he injured himself.
This is taking nothing away from Rodney Knowles
who played a great game Saturday night, but Maloy
and Cook, having played together most of the season,
know each other’s moves both offensively and. defen-
sively.

For 40 minutes on Saturday night we had some
Carolina fans very worried, especially the first 30
minutes. Here was this ‘‘out-classed team” from some
small “brain” college somewhere near Charlotte with
only a thousand students beating their big university
heros. When Larry Miller, Carolina’s All-American
forward, told sportswriters after the game that he
wasn’t worried when Davidson was leading at the half,
he begins to sound like a “Compoz” tranquilizer com-
mercial on the radio. Or don't you “take that off any-
one” either, Larry?

But despite cool, calm, and collected Larry Miller,
the North Carolina players as well as their fans knew
Davidson was there and that they probably will be back
next year. I hate to think we have to revert to the pro-
verbial “wait til next year” cliche but that seems our
only alternative. So, “Carolina, wait till next year,
we'll be back.” Signed: The Davidson Basketball Team.

Mike O'Neill, playing in his
familiar substitute position,
did all that could be expect-
ed from him. He shot well
and did a great job rebound-

Clark and Bunting.

All the Wildcats were in-

the loss. But perhaps most
affected was Doug Cook.

Playing without their num-

the ‘Cat netters took a 6-0
lead, and then with Berner's
help, toppled Kent State's
doubles team, 30, to make
it a clean sweep.

Team captain Pinky
Hatcher assumed Berner’s
number one position and
crushed KSU’s top-seeded

in two sets, 6-0, 62.

In number two singles, Da-

for the loss.

Pembroke tracksters were
able to place 1-2 in several
events, a feat which the ‘Cats
were unable to equal.

Individual winners plus vic-
tories in the 440 and mile re-
lays were not enough to over-
come the lack of depth.

Outstanding performers for
the thinclads were numerous.
In the sprints Rick Lyon won
the 100 in 9.9 seconds and the
220 in 22.2, as well as anchor-
ing the winning 440 yard re-
lay team.

Greg Cox was the most
versatile performer for the
‘Cats. He won the broad
jump, the 220 high hurdles,
placed third in the triple
jump, and ran on the 440
relay team.

Team captain Jim Mc-
Laughlin won the 3-mile run
decisively after having prev-
jously run the mile.

Other first places for the
‘Cats were scored by Wayne
Huckel in the javelin and
Frank Bass in the high jump.

The remainder of the
Davidson points were scored
by Tony Orsbon, third in the
high jump; Steve Kirley, sec-
ond in the shot put and dis-
cus: Mike Culbreth, third in
the discus; Jimmy Trus

To Adelphi Nine

By BILL TRAXLER
Sports Writer

Overwhelmed by a strong
hitting attack and hampered
by a lack of depth in pitch-
ing. the Davidson baseball
team fell to Adelphi Univer-
sity yesterday afternoon, 8-3.

The Adelphi nine. which

defeated the University of
North Carolina's strong team
Monday, picked up four runs
apiece from ‘Cat hurlers John
Riggs and Macky Reavis.
_ It was the third loss in as
many outings for the David-
son nine, but it was a hard
hitting Wildcat team which
fell to Adelphi.

Sophomore third baseman
Gordon Stade became the
first Davidson player to hit a
home run out of the team's
new field since it was con-
structed in 1966. Slade’s blast
in the first inning came after
Frank Murphy had singled
and sailed over the 355 foot
marker in left field.

The ‘Cat nine scored again
in the third inning. Reavis.
who relieved Riggs in the top
of the inning, led off the bar-
rage with a triple to left cen-
ter. It was followed by sin-
gles by Frank Murphy and
Cliff Patteron, and he scored
on Slade’s sacrifice fly to
center field.

Three runs were ali that
the ‘Cats were able to mus-

ter, as they were unable to
put a hitting attack together
late in the game. when Adel-
phi tagged Reavis for four
runs. Reavis was relieved by
freshman Wade Shepherd in
the seventh inning.
Previously this week the
‘Cats absorbed their second
loss in a row to Pfeiffer Col-
lege, this time by a 10.7
score. They had dropped a
game to the Misenheimer
squad, 7-5, before that.
Next week the ‘Cats leave
for their spring tour in Flor-
ida, playing Armstrong, Jack-
sonville and Ga. Southern.

Defensive Stars
Sign Grid Grants

Two high school football
Standouts have signed grants-
in-aid with Davidson, accord-
ing to Coach Dave Fagg.

Robert Norris, a Statesville
linebacker, captained his
team this season, and ranks
third in a class of 326. “He's
rugged,” says Fagg, ‘‘and
not many people like to play
against him.”

A Burlington end-tackle,
Steve Baldwin, will probably
play defensive end or interi-
or lineman for the ‘Cats. A
6-3, 210-pounder, he was on
the North Carolina Shrine
Bowl team last fall.

MONEY: THE STORY OF AN ENGINEER

We all know, of course, that in this age of technology
every engineering senior is receiving fabulous offers of
employment, but do we realize just how fabulous these
offers are? Do we comprehend just how keenly industry
is competing? To illustrate, let me cite the true and typi-
cal case of E. Pluribus Ewbank, a true and typical senior.

One day last week while strolling across the M.LT.
eampus, E. Pluribus was hailed by a portly and prosper-
ous man who sat in a yellow convertible studded with
precious gem stones. “Hello,” said the portly and pros-
perous man, “I am Portly Prosperous, president of
American Xerographic Data Processing and Birth Con-
trol, Incorporated. Are you a senior?”

“Yes, air,” said E. Pluribus.

“Do you like this car?” said Portly.

“Yes, sir,” said E.

Pluribus.
“It’s yours,” said Portly.

“Thanks, hey,” said E. Pluribus.
“Do you like Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades?”

turn down the offer on the
amount of time it would take
away from his class work.

‘It was my cut. situation,”
Maloy said. ‘‘We had quite a
few because of basketball and
I don't want to do anything
that would jeopardize my
status for next year.”’

Maloy also was named re-
cently to Bucknell’s all-op-
ponent team,

ing opponent.

said B. Pluribus.

“Here is a pack,” said Portly. “And a new pack will

“Thanks, hey,” said E. Pluribus.

“What clean living, clean shaven American does not?”
said E. Pluribus. '

Portly pressed a button on the dashboard of the con-
vertible and the trunk opened up and out came a nubile
maiden with golden hair, rosy knees, a perfect disposi-
tion, and the appendix already removed. ‘This is Svet-
lana O'Toole,” said Portly. “Would you like to marry her?”

“Is her appendix out?” said E. Pluribus.

“Yes,”’ said Portly.

“Okay, hey,” said E. Pluribus.

“Congratulations,” said Portly. “And for the happy
bride, a set of 300 monogrammed prawn forks.”

“Thanks, hey,” said Svetlana.

“Now then,” said Portly to E. Pluribus, “let us get
down to business. My company will start you at $75,000
a year. You will retire at full salary upon reaching the
age of 26. We will give you an eleven-story house made of
lapis lazuli, each room to be stocked with edible furniture.
Your children will receive a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as they
shall live. We will keep your teeth in good repair and also
the teeth of your wife and children unto the third genera-
tion. We will send your dentist a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as
he shall live, and thereafter to his heirs and assigns...
Now, son, I want you to think carefully about this offer.
Meanwhile here is 50 thousand dollars in small, un-
marked bills which places you under no obligation what-
soever.”

“Well, it certainly seems like a fair offer,” said E.
Pluribus. “But there is something you should know. I am
not an engineer. In fact I don’t go to M.L.T at all. I just
walked over here to admire the trees. I am at Harvard,
majoring in Joyce Kilmer.”

“Oh,” said Portly.

“I guess I don’t get to keep the money and the con-
vertible and the Pergonnas and the broad, do 1?” said E.
Pluribus.

“Of course you do,” said Portly. “And if you'd like the
job, my offer still stands.”
