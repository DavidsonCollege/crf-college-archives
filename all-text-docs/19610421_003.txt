Thinclads Aim

“Best Meet” -

BY GEORGE PEPPER
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The track team will meet a powerful VPI team here on Tuesday in one of the

season’s highlights. Coach Roger Thrift says that this is

been pointing for, adding “It will be the best meet of the season, and we'll need our

best performance to win.”

Thrift is counting on the 440-
yard run, the 220-yard dash, and
the broad jump to give David-
son the nod.

Tech will be strong in the
distances and quarter mile run,
as they have several Southern
Conference champions entered
in these events.

SWAMP RICHMOND

This past Tuesday the thin-
clads swamped Richmond in a
107 2/3-32 1/3 victory. Although
no school records were broken
in Ahe course of the meet, the
final tally is in itself an impres-
sive showing of the team’s
strength.

DOLE RECRUITING TOO

While most of our enthusiasm, praise and interest has
centered around Coach Lefty Driesell and the excellent
job he is doing to round up some good basketball players
for the next few years, we haven’t forgotten Bill Dole and
the fine job he is doing.

Dole is a man in a precarious position. He coaches a
football team that represents the smallest school in the
Southern Conference. Consequently, Dole cannot give
nearly as many scholarships as his bigger brothers, and
he often finds that he has fewer men on his squad than
some of the schools have on full scholarship.

A full scholarship is a rarity to Dole. Since he isn’t
allotted much money, he has to divide the amount into
part scholarships in order to get enough players.

Despite being the smallest school in the conference,
Davidson is undoubtedly the academic superior over, the
other eight members. More than one good football play-
er has had to be rejected due to insufficient academic
requirements.

This past fall, however, Dole proved that intelligent
lads can play football. After a slow start, Dole guided his
men to victories over VPI and Lehigh, and defeated Fur-
man in everything but the score, a 22-21 heartbreaker.

Dole’s scrappy Wildcats picked up this spring where
they left off in the fall, and turned in “the best spring
practice ever at Davidson College.”

Last Saturday’s Red-White game, which the Reds won
by 26-12, indicated that next fall will find the Cats a

some good recruiting a few years before. i

Thus far, Dole
heated this way next fali from the high school ranks.
None of these ten has a full saholarship, but all will re-

There is a note of optimism in the coach’s voice as he
talks about his newest band of recruits. “It’s a fine
group,” he declares. “Some of them have predicted 2
averages, so they're smart as well as good football play-
ers.”

Of the more outstanding of these future Wildcats, Dole
elaborated on the following names:

Steve Heckard, 6-2, 185 lb. end, from Reynolds High
School in Winston-Salem. Heckard played as a sopho-
more on the 1958 co-state champion 3-A team at -
olds, and this past fall, ne was tri-captain of the 4-A
Demons that went to the state finals, before bowing to
Greensboro. (Incidentally, present Wildcat guard Dick
Voorhees was a member of that 1958 team.) Dole plans to
use Heckard as a split end since he is tall, fast, and has
good hands. Says Dole, “Heckard will probably start as

a sophomore.”

Ashley’s finalists this past fall. Hendricks played -

for ability to detect the play, react, and then clobber the
