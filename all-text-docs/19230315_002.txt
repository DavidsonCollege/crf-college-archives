NICHES IN THE WILDCAT:
HALL OF FAME

EVERETT LITTLE BOOE, ’12.

Everett Little Booe of Davidson,
N. C., is one of the most prominent
of the many Wildcats who claim
the college town as their home
town. His Freshman year he fail-
ed to make a letter on the gridiron
but started his athletic career by
playing third base on the baseball
team and making a track mono-
gram.

The following year Tiny played
fullback and in 1910 proved a prom-
inent factor in the Wildcats’ first
victory over Carolina. He was
elected captain of the 1911 team
and played at left halfback. He
won All-South Atlantic honors.

Slip was an adept at broken-tield
running and his work as a punter
was both dependable and brilliant.
In writing of him a Southern
coach said: “There is only one
Booe, a slippery bundle of nervous
energy, dodging, sidestepping, elu-
sive, and sensational all the time,—
that is Booe. Without a peer as a
he is a brilliant little jewel that
would shine in any backfield.

ATHLETICS

On the diamond, Slip was a won-
der, catching one year and playing
the hot corner for three seasons.
After finishing at Davidson, he
played for the Pittsburgh Pirates,
‘making good at the keystone sack.

When.the Great War broke out
Booe went to the Officers Training
Camp at Fort Oglethorpe and re-
ceived his 2nd Lieutenant’s com-
mission. In the spring of ’18 he
went over to France and was at
the front during the second battle
of the Marne and the great Ar-
gonne drive. He was sent back to
America as an instructor and was
made a Ist Lieutenant just before
his discharge early in 1919.

Slip is now in business in San
Antonio, Texas, making good in
the world, as he made good on the
gridiron and battlefield.

CAROLINA DOPE

The coming of Spring brings
with it the advent of baseball, and
on.all the athletic fields throughout
the state teams are warming up for
the schedules that begin at the end
of the month.

Wake Forest and Trinity look
about as good as the next one for
champion teams on the diamond
this year. Both had good clubs
last year and many of the same
men are back. Trinity’s weak spot
is first base and the filling of that
position is causing Coach Steiner
not a little trouble. Wake Forest
has a strong man in Clarke, a form-
er Wake Forest star, who has mi-
grated to the Baptist squad. He is
a-good man in the field and a regu-
lar Babe Ruth at the bat.

Carolina, like Davidson, has a
number of vacancies to fill. Bry-
son is the only letter man back in
the box. This is the third year
for the big boy, and last summer
he won 20 out of 24 games, pitching
for Maxton. With the aid of Coxe,
a former Yale twirler, and some
promising new material, the Tar
Heels ought to be as strong as
usual in the pitching line. Monk
McDonald, a star in every sport,
will hold down short, but McLean,

mond base.

veteran second sacker has so
many tabs that it is doubtful if he
will play. Sweetman is the only
veteran in the field,

Carolina is hitting out on a new
angle this year and have a South-
ern trip planed to include Auburn,
Alabama, Georgia, Georgia Tech
and Mercer. It will be a severe test
for the champion Tar Heels.

N. C. State has all but four men

4! back from a squad that last sea-

son won thirteen and lost nine
games. Curtis and Allen will have

5) to bear the brunt of the pitching.

The only other postion that is caus-
ing the coaches any trouble is sec-
State has a nineteen
game schedule this spring.
Over at Elon a general shake-up
Perry, who has
been in the box for several seasons
will do the receiving this time;

| while Barker and Fogleman will

be the most dependable hurlers.
“The pitchers look good,” says
Coach Carboy, “In fact they ought
to be the strongest in the last five
years.” Elon will have about half
new men on the diamond.

Lindamood, taking White’s place for
Davidson, wrestled Bickford, of V.

This was Davidson’s final match of
the season, which closes without a
victory but with two creditable show-
ings as their record. Reviewing the
results of the season: Davidson suf-
fered a decisive defeat at Trinity, a
close call at Cardlina, and a near vic-
tory at V. M. I. This is not such a
bad record against teams which are
well coached by full time men and
well equipped.

Those interested in wrestling see it
as a sport growing in popularity and
predict that Davidson will stay in the
swim and give worthy account of her-
self in the coming seasons,

The 1923-24 captain-manager will
be elected within the near future, and
work on a bigger and better year will
begin. at that time. It is hoped that
several matches can be arranged on
the hill next season. The outcome of
the Athletic Association’s handling of
the question of awarding letters to
the wrestling team will be announced
at a later date.
