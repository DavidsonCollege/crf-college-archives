|Union Desk Offers
Student Blue Book

The Blue Book, a student
directory printed by the Union
Publications Committee, will be
available to students for a
limited time at the Union Desk.

The committee has prepared
||about 1,000 copies of the direc-
tory, and they are being made
available to the student body
at the publication cost of 35
cents; and to the faculty and
other interested parties at the
cost of one dollar.

j This directory is the only

information source on campus
| which lists under one cover the
student, his class, fraternity,
i|post office box, room number
and home address. The direc-
tory also contains a list of tele-
phone numbers for the faculty,
for the administration and for
nearby girl's schools.

The committee hopes that
more student interest will be
shown in this phase of the
Union’s program so that future
projects of this type can obtain
necessary support. At present
only about 200 copies have been
sold at the Union. The commit-
tee nlans to dispose of the addi-
tional copies at nearby girl's

Dr. Richards Faces Student

Questioning In WF Meeting

Dr. J. McDowell Richards Wednesday night faced a
roomful of students at a meeting sponsored by the West-

minster Fellowship.

During the first twenty
minutes Dr. Richards presented
what he called “a preface to
discussion.” This preface he
divided into two sections. The
first was a presentation of the
basic tenets of the Lowry and
Harvard Report on General
Education (1945).

According to this report,
the purpose of education
should be to “liberate a man
from ignorance and preju-
dice.” A college should teach
a man to: 1.) think effective-
ly, 2.) communicate thoughts
and receive thoughts from
others, 3.) make relevant
judgments, and 4.) discrimin-
ate among values.

The Harvard Committee also
felt that there should be a uni-
fying idea around every college.
While unable to definitely pick
what this idea should be, the
Harvard Report rejected Chris-
tianity as the unifying prin-
ciple. .

In terms of Davidson, Or.
Richards maintained that the
principles on which the
school was founded affirmed:

1.) the reality of God as re-
vealed in Christ, 2.) the
reality of moral law, i. e.
that there is a definite dis-
tinction between right end
wrong, 3.) the value of the
redemptive purpose of God.

He continued by discussing
the place of freedom on..a
Christian campus. “Commit-
ment is not fatal to freedom.
Instead, belief is a part of the
good life. A free choice comes
from belief and ultimately from
principle. A measure of belief
is necessary to maintain an
open mind.”

His introductory remarks
concluded, Dr. Richards pro-
ceeded to open the floor for
discussion.

Q. How is Davidson striving
towerds its Christian ideals?

A. It is working for its ideals

through the composition of the
faculty." These are all fine
Christian men. Moreover, the
place of worship on the campus
is important.

Q@. These things don’t re-
flect ideals. They are simply
routine matters.

A. I don’t look on these
things as being routine.

Q. Regarding asfter-dance
parties and bed behavior in

vespers, the administration
seems more concerned shout
the reputation of the college
than any moral considera-
tions.

A. I know the men in the
administration and know that
they are very concerned about
the moral implicaiions of these
activities.

Q. Aren't vespers a denial
of student freedom?

A. No, they aren't. This is a
method of exposure to Chris-
tianity. ,

Q. Granted that Bible is
merely exposure, but since
vespers is a worship experi-
ence, how can you justify
calling this simply exposure?

A. Well, 1 guess the word ex-
posure was wrong. We don’t
force one to believe in Chris-
tianity, do we?

Q. In what way is a faculty
member free?

A. He does not have the free-
dom to teach what he wants.
However, he does have the
freedom to think as he wishes
and the freedom to leave.

Q. In light of the fact that
250 students, the DAVID-
SONIAN, and a significant
segment of the faculty re-
quested that a committee be
formed to study the race
question, do you feel that
the Trustees failure to act és
an indication of ethical and
intellectual health?

A. Let it be understood that
I do not intend to criticize my
fellow trustees. I think not.
This is not a sign of health, but
of sickness.

Q. in the light of this dis-
eussion, the worth of emi-
nent practicality hes certainly
been shown: regarding the
recognition of the preference
of ROTC over the arts on the
required curriculum, Bible
over philosophy, vespers
over complete freedom, seth-
letics over academics, segre-
gation over integration.
Where then is the ideal?

A. Davidson, in not being a
totalitarian system which could
legislate given opinion and
established ideal, is left with
the paradox of the democratic
state: that the ideal must be one
of evolvement, and we must re-
sign ouselves to the faith that
the ideal will come about
gradually.

Johnston Named To| 959 Cilts To

Centennial Board

North Carolina Governor
Luther Hodges recently appoint-
ed Dean Frontis Johnston a

member of the Confederate
Centennial Commiesion which
will have charge of the work of
the Civil War Centennial in this
state.

When asked about the work
of the Commission, Dr. John-
ston commented, “So far, we
have had only one meeting in
which officers and other mem-
bers of the executive commit-
tee were elected. Mr. Hugh
Dortch of Goldsboro, N. C., was
elected Chairman of the com-
mittee.”

He went on to say, “The Cen-
tennial has not yet become of
state-wide importance, but the
Commission is going to try to
make it well-known throughout
the state.” Other members of
the Commission include such
authors and educators as Pro-
fessor Hugh Lefler, University
of North Carolina; Burke Davis,
author; and Dr. Robert H.
Woody of Duke.

Dr. Johnston's popular course
in the Civil War period is not
being given this year due to his
assumption of new duties as
Dean of the Faculty. It will be
offered next year according to
present plans.

Students Offered
Reading Courses

As during the past several
semesters, the Student Counsel-
ing Office will again offer a
Developmental Reading Course
this semester. The course which
is directed by Mrs. H. T. Lilly,
will begin early this semester,
and a fee of $25 will be charged
for admission.

The course is a non-credit
course and meets three times
per week for nine weeks. At the
end of this period, those need-
ing further aid may obtain it
without additional cost. Dr.
Ostwalt, Director of the Student
Counseling Office, stated that a
limited number of scholarships
are also available for students
who are unable to finanee the
course.

The course is not a remedial
reading course, but one design-
ed to develop, through special
effort drills and concentration,
a better use of reading skills.
The course is directed toward a
final end of better comprehep-
sion. It is offered with the be-
lief that comprehensive read-
ing, developed under conditions
which characterize the reading
habits of superior readers, will
‘gradually establish essential
reading methods.

Students who are not sure
about their reading abilities, or
are interested in enrolling in
the course are invited to con-
sult the Director of the Student
Counseling Office, Room 231,
Chambers; or Mrs. Lilly, Room
232, Chambers.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1960

College

Double The ’58 Total

Gifts to Davidson College in 1959 were more than
double the amount contributed in 1958, according to
President D. Grier Martin’s annual report to the Trustees
of the college at their semi-annual meeting here Wednes-

day.

Sparked by philanthropist-
industrialist Charles A. Dana’s
$400,000 challenge grant in
April 1958, Davidson alumni,
friends, foundations and cor-
porations provided $1,874,260
during the 1959 calendar year
as compared with $927,306 in
1958.

“This evidence of increased
interest on the part of those
who know the college best,”
stated Dr. Martin, “has now
motivated Mr. Dana to provide
$600,000 in additional gifts to
bring his total gifts to David-
son to the million dollar mark,
the largest amount ever given
the college by one individual,
except for the equity of the
college in the Duke Endow-
ment.”

President Martin announc-
ed fo the trustees that Mr..
Dana’s additional gifts and
pledges to the college include
$200,000 as a challenge grant
in the current program to
secure funds for a $600,000
John R. Cunningham Music
and Fine Arts Building; $100,-
000 for endowment to sup-
port the recently-completed
Charlies A. Dana _ Science
Laboratories; and $100,000
over a five-year period for
the Charles A. Dana Scholar: ,
ship Program.

The trustees’ agenda included
a review of progress in David-
son's long-term $11,561,200 de-
velopment program which has
provided $4,135,110 for endow:
ment and building purposes
since 1957 when the effort, as a
“Ten-Year Plan,” was first
launched.

President Martin pointed out
that, while $2,037,656 has been
raised to provide important
new buildings for Davidson dur-
ing the last three years, $2,093,-
954 has also been added to the
college endowment to help
keep Davidson's educational
program in step with new de-
mands in all areas of science
and the liberal arts.

Peesident Martin ennoune-
ed that the principal needs
remaining to be met in the
Ten-Year Program will total
at least $7,500,000, primarily
for faculty salary endowment
and other instructional costs.
“te will require,” he said,
“concerted effort on the part
of alt those who believe in
Davidson to secure this essen-
tial financial backing with-
out which the college will not
be able to maintain the role
of educational leadership
which it is in most respects
well-equipped to pley.”

One of the major actions by
the trustees was to increase
Davidson's tuition from $600 to

$700 per year in a move to help
finance salary increases as of
July 1, 1960 for all members of
the Davidson faculty. This move
comes as a step forward in
Davidson's continuous program
to provide a steadily increasing
faculty salary scale.

Together with the $450,000
faculty salary endowment
grant which Davidson received
in December 1959 from the Z.
Smith Reynolds Foundation, it
recognizes, in the words of
President Martin, that “without
a doubt, the key to the success
of a college like Davidson is its
teaching faculty.”

During their dey-long meet-
ings, the trustees reviewed
tho college admissions pro-
gram which must process
each year an ever-larger num-
ber of applications from
highly qualified students who
have, according to President
Martin, “high academic ability
plus qualities of leadership,
cheracter and personality
which make them outstanding
in their ability to contribute
to the life of the Davidson
student body and to the wider
community in their lives after
college.”

Dr. J. McDowell Richards,
who serves as president of the
Davidson Trustees and Colum-
bia Theological Seminary in
Decatur, Ga., presided at both
the morning and afternoon ses-
sions. Also on the day’s sched-
ule were a tour of the recently
completed Dana Science Lab-
oratories, a luncheon honoring
faculty members appointed to
their positions at Davidson
since 1956, and a late afternoon
coffee hour at the President's
home, with veteran members of
Davidson's faculty and staff.
