Inside Charlotte

The Charlotte Troll
Goes to Mooresville

By Rob Kelley

When | first thought of writing
another article for INSIDE CHAR-
LOTTE, we were directly in the
middle of the Gulf Crisis. Conse-
quently, Amazing Rob, the Char-
lotte Troll, was not about to guzzle
his gas down to Charlotte. Instead,
I turned my sights northward--In-
side Mooresville.

Hidden down a dark and wind-

reads: “You must be 16 or older
toplay pool.” Beyond the tables,
over the bowling pits, lie the
alleys.

Their light floods the entire
back half of the building, and is
almost too bright to look out.
Bowls thunder down the lanes,
crashing loudly into the var-
nished phalanx.

It was then that I realized:

Inside Moor Lanes, the scene is typical: Most of
them are between 35 and 40. Dirty t-shirts are de
riguer. The women wear tight, stone-washed jeans.

ing road in upper Mooresville sits a
low brick building. It hides in the
night like some druidic lodge. The
only things that might dispel are the
tiny sign near the road and the mildly
conspicuous four-foot tall lighted
letters set into “B-O-W-L-I-N-G”.

Inside Moor Lanes, the scene is
typical: a-number of non-college-
people out having a good time. Most
of them seem between thirty-five
and forty. Dirty t-shirts are de riguer.
The women wear tight, stone-
washed jeans.

Asnack bar stands to the left of
the door, the front desk to the right.
The thin carpet that covers the ce-
ment resembles the pattemed rugs
common toall such establishments.
Four pool tables cross the floor be-
fore me, with three or four pinball
machines on. the left side, eight or
ten video games on theright. A sign

gone too far,

life without bowling is no life at
all.

The gaudy shoes, the blister
you get on the inside of your
thumb, the pitiful score that is
shown via video screen to the
entire crowd.

If you miss it as much as I
do, you might want to check out
one night this dark temple hid-
den within the woods of
Mooresville.

Take Highway 115 (Main
Street) north for about five miles.
When you reach the first stop-
light (Brawley), turn left over
the railroad tracks, then right
onto the road that runs parallel
along the other side. Continue
on this road about two miles.
The building will be on the left.

Seeing Double, ‘Ete. Why Hangovers Are So Ugly

’ By Marlo Cobb. -
The effect that alcohol has on
your body depends in part on the

method of intoxication you prefer.’

Any form of hard liquor is ab-
sorbed faster than wine, which is
absorbed faster than beer, because
there are more substances in beer
besides alcohol which compete
with the alcohol for absorption
along the intestinal wall. :

ts slow the emptying of the
stomath into the small intestine,
where the mostalcohol is absorbed,
so have some whole milk orcheese
before going out. Bread will help,
but not as well because of its low
fat content. The carbon dioxide in
bubbly alcoholic drinks, including
champagne, supposedly has the
opposite effect; it speeds up the
digestive process by opening the

valve between stomach ‘nd intes-

Alcohol is also absorbed into
the body to some extent from the

stomach and colon, and once it °

leaves the digestive tract, it is rap-
idly distributed to all tissues. ~

A breathalizer works with such
accuracy because alcohol is: pres-
ent in exhaled air in the’ same pro-
portion as alcohol present in the
blood, so a numerical portion of
the alcohol content in your breath
can be easily converted to blood
content, and from there to your
level of drunkenness. :

Alcohol is broken down like a
carbohydrate. While it is being
burned as energy, it is removed
from the system as a drug. This

metabolization of alcohol is about”

the only way toremove the alcohol

from your body, since only about
5-10 percent is: excreted’ in the
breath and urine.

The problem is that not much
can be metabolized at once. A
certain “enzyme, ADH (alcohol
dehydrogenase), is necesary -to
break alcohol down. ADH is pres-
ent only in the liver, and to a lesser
degree in the testes and retina.

' ADH originally existed in our
systems to deal with-natural alco-
holic substances produced by the
body which would poison us if
they were allowed to accumulate.
ADH works slowly and consis-
tently, dealing with about 7 grams
ofalcohol per hour, which means it
takes 2 hours to deal with the
amount of alcohol in one 12-o0z.
beer. .

One by-product of this is an

accumulation of lactase in the form
of lactic acid, which is associated
with muscle fatigue and cramps.
Because.muscles cannot use alco-
hol as an energy source until after
ADH has done its part, exercise
won't get you sober any faster.

. There are various alternatives
that will speed up the breakdown

~ «OF alcohol include taking certain

drugs, or injecting fructose inter-
veineously, not very pleasant al-
ternatives to “waiting it out”.
Everyone knows that alcohol
acts as a depressant on the nervous

system. So, what about that “party.

frenzy” that hits some of us? Why
do some people seem to have taken
megadoses of caffeine ain drink:

This “high” is a symptom of
alcohol’s stupifying influence on

* the higher functions of the brain,

which~ include the. inhibitory
mechanisms which ‘control our
doing stupid things in public. :

As more alcohol reaches the
brain, other of its functions are
tampered with, we lose coordina-
tion, our vision blurs, and we can’t
concentrate on anything: We can’t
even speak correctly. .If enough
alcoholis present, unconciousness
will follow.

Another thing alcohol does is to
interefere with some pituitary and
adrenal hormones that act as diu-
retics. This causes increased water
secretion: Basically, more trips to
the bathroom.

I have been told that it is espe-
cially bad to order alcohol on air-
