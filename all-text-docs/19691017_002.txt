OCTOBER 17, 1969

Moratorium

At exactly 0513, the 18th of April, 1906, a cow
was standing at 123920’ West Longtitude, 37°58’ North
Latitude — somewhere between the main barn and
the milking shed on the old Shafter Ranch in Califor-
nia, minding her own business. Suddenly the earth
shook, the skies trembled, and when it was all over,
there was nothing showing of the cow above gro ind
but a bit of her tail sticking up. For the student of
change, the Shafter cow is a sort of symbol of our
h gentle
thoughts as cows are likely to have. while huge forces
outside her ken built up all at once in a great move
ment that changed the configuration of the earth,
and destroyed a city, and swallowed her up... if we
do not learn to understand and guide the great forces
of change at work in our world today, we may find
ourselves like the Shafter cow, swallowed up by the
vast upheavals in our way of life — quite early some

We commend the Sigma Chi’s for
the courage and initiative they demon
strated in breaking with their national
organization. The Machi’s going local
may be the start of major changes on
the Patterson fraternity court.

Most of Davidson’s fraternities have
studied the possibility of going local,
but until now everyone has been re-
luctant to be the first to act.

The standard argument against na-
tional affiliation has been that national
benefits cost more than they're worth.

For about $100—-more or less, de-
pending upen the fraternity—a stu
dent receives a membership card, a
lifetime subscription to the national
fraternity magazine, access to ritual
initiation, and the ‘‘prestige’’ of the
name. Most fraternities also grant
visiting privileges to other chapters.

The case for national affiliation has
been basically: “If we go local we'll
be killed in the rush.’ Until now,

Going Local

this fear has kept everyone from tak-
ing the first step.

What effects the Sigma Chi action
will have on the Davidson campus
only time will tell. The Machi’s, in-
deed, may be killed,in rush: Conver-
sely, other fraternities may follow
the Machi lead and disaffiliate.

To be sure, going local will not solve
the inherent evils of the fraternity
system, nor will it affect the frater-
nity’s basic strength—providing its
members with a social outlet. The
dropping of two Greek letters and a
night’s ritual will not affect the
“brotherhood” which may or may
not exist within a fraternity.

Unfortunately, no matter what hap-
pens to Patterson Court the dejection
felt by those rejected by the system
and. the more lasting and more im-
portant problem of providing those
students with a social outlet will re-
main unchanged.

The Pedagogy Of Sex

In a remarkable display of plan-
ning the ‘administration has initiated
its long anticipated (and sometimes
dreaded) series on drugs, sex and
alcohol.

It is remarkable, largely because
the College has undertaken the task
of educating a not-so-uneducated
group of freshmen on some rather
difficult subjects, and because they
have done an admirable job of bring-
ing in the experts.

The Davidson

It has:just been one of those years.

First it was the Cubs, and then the
Mets.

Now it’s us. There’s good o!’ Gordon
Slade, and Kelly and Hannen. And

Us. Davidson College. Football.
What is this?

There’s the coach about whom they
used to say, ‘he holds an Ivy League
record.’’ Now they say, ‘‘He’s David-
son’s coach.” ;

Its a long road to Orlando, but then,
nobody ever thought Shea Stadium
would be in the running today either.

When the course was pro last
year with the adoption of the rather
liberal regulations ‘on alcohol, many
persons marked it off as a failure
from the outset.

Imagine. Trying to “teach’? mem-
bers of the country-club set about the
problems of alcohol, or attempting
to offer. sex education to a group of
students who _have_alreadydiscover-
ed their sexuality. ©

The initial vision, which was not
without some past foundation, was
that the courses would be in form
of the chapel sermons of the past,
with the speaker having graduated
from Davidson and one of three sem-
inaries which maintain speakers’
bureaus.

But the realization of the idea has
been far more gratifying. It has been
realistic. It has been successful.

As far as one can go in searching
out the “experts,” the college has
succeeded in gathering a group of
highly-qualified individuals to provide
the departure points in personal be-
havior evaluations. ©

To the Editor:
The adoption of the Code
of Responsibility theoretical-
«ly symbolized the end of an
unenlightened era of dicho
tomy. This document impli-
citly affirmed the recogni-
tion by all members of the
“college community” that
we are all here for the same
major purposes. 2

And at last the picture
of the autonomous, dictorial
administration in a constant
conflict of interests with the
rebellious, irresponsible stu-
dent body was proved to be
a figment of our imagina-
tion.

Thus we merged our spirts
—E pluribus unum. A “‘col-
lege community” all dedi-
cated to the same géals.

Because of this theoretical
merger it is also implicit
in the Code that every mem-
ber of the ‘‘college commun;
ity’ is liable to the Code,
and thus is expected to con-
duct himself ‘‘with respon-
sible maturity.’

The only remnant of the
old dichotomy lies in the
first paragraph of the sec-
tion entitled ‘Philosophy of
Discipline’ in which it is
written that the non-student
members of the ‘college

Big businessmen and this
gang are two sides of a coins
Instheir fight for high profits
big businessmen hurt the
people with low wages, lousy
working conditions, schools
that oppress both students
and teachers, and the war in

The provocateurs attack
the people so everyone wilt
forget big businessmen. This
is the oldest trick in the
book.

The ultimate attack on the
people planned by these pro-
vacteurs was to take place in
Chicago October 8-11.

Built for under slogans like
“Day of ‘Rage’’ and ‘The
Time is Right for Fighting

pose of “bringing the war

tions mean planned attacks

community” are subject to
a separate judiciary than are
student members. A_ fact
which seems incongruous
but understandable.

What | am arriving at by_
this review of past history
is this: last Sunday an
“agent of the administra-
tion” (that is, one of the se-
curity officers. who is by
definition a member of the
“college community’) con-
ducted himself in an appar-
ently irresponsible manner
(part of which included driv-
ing through a hedge in an
apparent. attempt. to. run
over a dog at which he had
become angered).

As in any case there are
extenuating circumstances;
nonetheless the outward evi-
dence would certainly war-
rant investigation and if that
investigation proved the evi-
dence to be as it appears
some measures need to be
taken.

I feel personally that the
students have taken the Code
most seriously as is indicat-
ed by the small, number of
infractions «brought before
the Regulations Court.

If we were serious from
both ends when we deemed
ourselves a ‘‘college com-
munity,’ it should be inter-
esting to see whether the
non-student members of said
community are willing to
hold up their end of the bar-
gain by considering us all as
members of the same unit,
subject to the same expecta-
tions of conduct or if this
whole matter will be swept
under that
proverbial. carpet
promptly forgotten.

In practice their “affinity
groups” have made it clear
that they see the people as
pigs—that they plan to fight
everyone in sight!

Since they make the peo
ple the enemy they're up
against tremendous odds —
and they're building for this
action saying that it won't
be a success unless some of
them are killed!

This demonstration is a
last-ditch effort by these
provocateurs to divert people
from the real source of their
opression and to discredit
SDS! No one should go to it;
its a police trap!

People will see through
this trick. No dwindling gang
of cops and the few they
mislead will hide the facts.

The big businessmen who
run this country and who
benefit from the war in Viet-
nam are responsible for the

rotten conditions in the
schools, in the cities, and on
the job.

SDS_ supports — students’

parents’, and teachers’ fights
for better conditions in the

schools; and SDS_ supports
working people's — struggle

against their bosses.

We will continue to fight
university expansion which
throws working people out of
their homes: We oppose the
Vietnam war, demanding
No Nogotiation — Immediate
Withdrawal,

We are backing the de-
mands of campus workers,
building an alliance between
these workers and students.
This tiny gang of cops, fools,
and hate-the-peopple provo-
cateurs has nothing to do
with SDS.

To the Editor:

In the middle of all the

confusion a class of 290
young Davidson men are
still in Wonder as to what
the future holds in the form
of educational trivia which
must be memorized and re-
cited back to earn that in-
famous Davidson diploma.
It does not take one with
extreme insight to see that
this year’s Sophomore class
is in a crisis, and it's a
serious ‘one.
_ In the past year there has
been-a lot of talk about area
exams. Some have been con-
cerned with their objectives
but one must admit that the
talk has centered around
how to get by them in the
least painful method.

Davidson has come out
“with the idea that a- David-
son diploma should repre-
sent self-study, while attend-
“ence in class remains man-
datory. Why? One cannot
learn without lectures and
hand waving performances
of his professors!

Yet on the other hand the
greatest part of your educa-
tion, says Davidson, will
come from your own ability
at self study. Does anyone
volunteer to corrolate the
two?

What's Who's Who?

“Who is ‘Who’s Who’?” quizzed a Who’s Who,
whom I shall not name here. :

The answer is more réyealing than we might-ex-
pect for a nationwide selection-of “outstanding stu-
dents.” :

The result of the selection is a process of forming
an annual volumn called ‘‘Who’s Who Among Students
In American Universities and Colleges.”

The originator and perpetrator of the whole pro-
gram is the Randall Publishing Company of Tusca
loosa, Alabama. ; ;

That's right, it’s a profit-making venture that gives
Davidson a certain number of names to send in_every

r.

The publication has a rather
infamous history. First it aggravated
thé University of Alabama by renting
a post office box.at the university’s
postal station and implying on its
stationary some affiliation with the
University of Alabama.

The national association of deans
of men recognized the organization or
as a shady one, with the result that yy

oe
a number of the best schools in the Gan
country stopped cooperating. HA hl
sti Tho’s WI STEW AN
Bit sill the Who’s No g SWEATT

and prospered.

In the early fifties the publishers faced a law suit
for their activities. They lost the suit — brought by
the A. N. Marquis & Co., publishers of ‘Who's Who in
America” — and the Randall Company’s letterhead
now carries a note to the effect that theirs is not the
Marquis publication.

But while the College certainly should applaud
this small, struggling company’s All-American suc-
cess story, it needn’t feel obligated to aid a commercial
experiment that appears to have ‘made it” on its own

’ merits, or whatever.

That is, if the College can establish its benefits
to be worthwhile — recognfzing the commercial na-
ture of the transaction —— then it is certainly justified
in continuing to contribute its few inches to each
auspicious annual edition.

But when the College agrees to go along with the
annual selection, it does’s0 under the publishing com-
pany’s rule that each school gets a certain number of
places to fill — no more or no less.

This year Davidson was given ninteeen spots.

Even, therefore, if we attach certain ‘values to
some sort of elitist idea of picking out those worthy
of note, we are left cold knowing that too few or too
many have been included-merely to satisfy a quota. *

Maybe Davidson needs some sort of honorary
to designate those who. can’t meet the academic re-
quirements of ODK, to recognize those’who have not
held “positions of importance” in the. student body.

But do we need a small publishing company in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama to give us directions in the mat-
ter? ;
It is true that the Pavidson students’ names ap-
pear in the annual volume along with the names of
students from loads of schools in the country. The
book includes many of the country’s best schools and
many of its least-known. By the. same token, many
of the country’s better known schools are not included
— Harvard, Amherst, Cornell, Oberlin to name a few.

Finally, the purveyors of the Who's Who pro-
duction offer a backstage benefit for the chosen nomi-
nees. (The colleges ‘nominate’ and the editors ‘‘ac-
cept” the nominations.) A “free certificate’ which
serves “AS documentary evidence of this honor and
in recognition of your accomplishments.” Also, a ref-
erence placement service which according to letters
reproduced in a company brochure helped lucky nomi-
nees to gain such positions as publie school teacher,
dining hall food supervisor, FBI agent and apprentice
cattle buyer. 4 /

If this seems like deals, it’s nothing compared to
the company’s special’offer to this year’s nominees
for purchasing this yéar’s volume: “If you order right
now, you may: take ttage of the pre-publication
discount price: of: $15.00 (After publication the

Let us give area exams:
the benefit of the doubt on
this problem and look real-
istically into the examina-
tion problem. In a question
and answer period with third
and fourth Watts last year,
Dr. Polley told those attend-
ing that preparation for the

exams should be about 100

hours apiece, or a grand
total of 400 hours.

Let us look into some fig-
ures Dr. Polley must have
overlooked. With three hours
a night, God give us week-
ends, that gives us only 300
hours; 100 hours short of
that magic number.

Keeping this in mind, let's
look into the plight of those
scholarship students that
have to work in the summer
just to come back to David
son. Say they work 10 hours
aeday at construction, 7 to
5:30. |

Are these fellows supposed
to come home, shower, eat
and curl up in an easy chair
.for an exciting evening with
the ‘‘New Intelligent Man’s
Guide to Science.’’ Well, I
hope not.

Area exams were not plan-
ned with enough care and
thought. The examination re-
sult was not to increase the
desire of a student to learn,

but to see how much he

could be told that he had to
learn,

How does a college expect
freshmen to begin Passing
exams of which the faculty
has only a sketchy idea?
This points out another
Poignant fact: the faculty
voted into existence a small
riding thundercloud while it
Passed en masse the Blué
Sky Resolutions.

Students as well as faculty
have constantly _ regarded
area exams in the aspect
that they must be passed to
be a junior, not as the chance
to read material one may
never ‘get the chance to read.
Even if they were, there is
too much to be covered in
so short a time, one would
only try to acquaint not un-
derstand.

With this almost universal
attitude, area exams should
be abolished until Proper
Study, experimentation and
evaluation have proved the
merits and demerits of area
exams,

Shall we meet the issue or
shall we back away?) Isn't it
time that the faculty and
the administration see that
the Great Experiment ‘isn't
so noble anymore?
