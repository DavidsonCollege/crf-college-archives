Juniors Acquit Themselves

(Continued from page 1)

orchestra, followed by the invoca-
tion by Dr. W. H. Miley. The first
half of the 12 victims then threw
the long-dreaded burden off of their
‘shoulders. It might have been said
;|mind, but that, too, seemed quite
well exhausted after such a display
of oratory and the expounding of so
many facts (?) The orchestra then
refreshed the audience with a few
jazzy selections. The monotony was
considerably broken by this Terpsi-
corean outbreak.

The second section, after a little
hesistancy, soon started the b(a-w) II
rolling again and should be given
equal honor in the making of the
exercises so interesting and amus-
ing, because they were not lacking
either in good sounds, logical rea-
soning or in wit and humor. It
‘would be an injustice to try to point
out the individual merits. Some had
;good delivery and not so weighty
;material while on the other hand
| there were a few good subjects and
‘speeches that were not adorned with
as forceful a delivery—however,’
they all had their merits.

They ripped with Euripides and
skipt with Scipio. Few had the elo-
quence of Demothsences or Cicero,
but it may well be said that oratory
is not a forgotten art. Much to the
disappointment of the speakers, the
attendance was not as good as their
speeches deserved.

Dr. T. W. Lingle introduced each
gentleman with an appropriate re-
mark about. both the man and his
subject.

Saturday Afternoon.

Dr. J. M. McConnell presided over
the last session of Junior Speaking.
The audience was as small as usual
, to begin with, but soon became larg-
er than any other during the exer-
cises. Most of the speakers divided
their attention between the stu-
dents on the left and the judges on.
the right, it being very disconcerting
‘to talk to the occupants of the cen-
| ter section. During the intermission
; the orchestra rendered “Tulip Time”
j to the accompaniment of much floor
{tapping by the audience. After the
‘last of the speakers had finished, Dr.
| McConnell addressed a few words of
j thanks to the hearers, and expressed .
his regret that more had not come
;to the exercises. .

Those delivering speeches were:
Allison, R. T.; Poteat, J. A.; Query,
S. M.; Rogers, R. L.; Romefelt, B.
W.; Baba, N. P.; Shaw, D. C.; Story,
J. R.; Thompson, F. N.; Vance, C.
R.; Walker, J. R.; White, H.

There was one very prominent
this
speaking. It was a rare occasion
that manuscripts were brought out,
for the speakers knew their speeches
well, and there was very little hesi-
tancy in their delivery. All in all,
this speaking was the best held in
several years, and everyone had a
fine time, for with fine weather,
beautiful girls, and “more pep”
everything went according to sched-
ule.

Winners of “Reps.”

“Congratulations, old top! Fine
speech! Made a ‘rep’ on that!”
‘These were the words which cheered
each Junior as he slowly departed
from the scene of the forensic ex-
ercises, bitterly remembering how
he had forgotten part of his speech,
made a bad blunder, or was so ner-
vous he could hardly speak above a
whisper. And yet, somehow,. the:
words of the speaker comforted him
jand made him believe that, after all
he had-not done so bad. Probably
he did have a chance at the coveted
“rep.” That question is settled by
the announcement of the following
men as winners:
