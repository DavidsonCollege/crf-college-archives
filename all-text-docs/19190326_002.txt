This will be the last issue of The Da-
vidsonian that the present staff will put
out. In looking back over the year, we
realize fully that the paper has not been
what it should or could have been, yet
considering, the conditions which have
existed during the past twelve months,
we feel we have done what we could.
Plans have been formulated which
should make The Davidsanian bigger
and better under the new staff, to whom
our sincere sympathy and best wishes are
extended.

COMMENCEMENT.

taoin shrdlu cmfwyp vbgkaqj jpjip
It is just two months off. ‘To some it
comes as an event long looked forward
to; to others as a time of mere enjoy-
ment: to still others as a release from
confinement on the campus. Unfortun-
ately the majority of the student body
look on it in this last light. Why is it
that so few students stay for commence-
ment? Whoever will answer this satis-
factorily and suggest some plausible rem-
edy, will have done the college a great
service. The Davidsonian will be glad
to publish any discussion of this ques-
tion, which is a knotty problem facing all
Is it a change in temperament
of the student or a lack of attraction in

the exercises themselves?

FACULTY AND STUDENTS.

One of the most unfortnate conditions
which exist in the American college of
today ts the tendency toward estrange-
ment, and consequently misunderstanding
between Faculty and Student Body.
Somehow the student often forgets that
the professor is human, and the professor
often forgets that the student exists. The
student thinks of the professor as unfeel-
ing and uninterested in student affairs,
picturing the faculty even as antagonistic
sometimes to student interests, Conse-
quently the student assumes, and en-
velopes himself in, an attitude of hostil-
ity, which he foolishly thinks is mutual.
He tends to foster this feeling thru
campus gossip, tho with no grounds for
his statements. Thus many students go
thru college without that intimate ac-
quaintance with the professors, which is
an invaluable education in itself.

The DAVIDSONIAN, March 26, 1919

Heard in Tennis Tournament,

As cordial and intimate as is the re-] dents of fifty years ago.

‘ation between professor ahd student at
Davidson, yet there is an unreasonable
coulf between Faculty and Student Body
as wholes. ft is not a condition that has
arisen of late, but his been prevalent in
all times, and in almost all colleges. It
is not the fault-of either, Faculty and
Student Body are so set apart, that some-
how they have no free means of com-
munication with one another. ‘The Stu-
dent Body has no lawful way to’ express
its approval or dissapproval of any ac-
tions taken by the Faculty; and the Fac-
ulty has no way to find out the seatiment
or opinion of the Student Body on such
subjects. We do not presume to say that
students could = match = their opinions
against the ripened judgment of Faculty
members, yet the Student Body as a
whole has the best interests of the col-
lege at heart, and should exert some in-
fluence at least ii matters of interest to
itself,

Fess hasty judgment on’ the part of
students and more of a spirit of fair con-
sideration, would result in a co-operation
on the campus which could not help but
prove an asset to the college.

FOR THE SMALL COLLEGE.

Another argument for the small col-
lege is found in the accusation that: stu-
dents of American colleges and universi-
ties have been Germanizved through too
much specialization on the part of the
men and women who tancht them. The
accusation comes from Professor Holli-
day, of the University of Montana.

The American institutions have been
following the lead of the German uni-
versaties, and like all copving have had
all of the bad features while the meritor-
ious ones have been lacking. The spe-
cialization has made the..professors lose
sight of the big issues which underlie their
little corner of research.. “The condition
of a college which has a special teacher
to teach each tiny branch of the subject
and nothing but that is like the shoe fac-
tory of taday in which there is not a man
whe can make a whole shoe.

Besides all that the specialized profes-
sor has at his command so much techni-
cal lingo that none can understand him.
Because of this, Professor Holliday ad-
vises the abolition of all learned societies.
He says that from his knowledge. grad-
uates of today are mentally lopsided be-
cause too many young Ph.D.'s sce noth-
ing but their desire to become graduate
professors,

In recommending a change, Professor
Holliday says that men who teach should
have had considerable training in several
correlated fields in order that they give
a broad survey of the entire situation.
Surely that isa recommend for the teach-
ing in a smaller institution.

Professor Hollidav says that students
of today have lost the vision of the stu-

can be licked. Even at that, you have
got to do the job behind its back. But
wt stamp never knows when it’s licked.
Placed on a piece of mail, its one object
is to deliver the goods at a prescribed
destination. And that is exactly what it
does. “Thru storm and flood, wreck and
disaster, it hangs on and never lets go.
It sticks until it gets there."—Ex.

How many of us stick until we get
there? Circumstances of far less im-
portance than floods and disasters sweep
us off of our feet. Why? Because we
haven't the grit and backbone to Stick.
We throw up the sponge before the fight
has begun, And say. we can’t before we
have tried to see if we could.

The world ts full of men and women
of this stigma. But those whom we all
admire and want to imitate are the ones
who say to circumstance, “So you will
break me, will vou? We will see. I
am going to see this thing thru. 1 am
going to get such strength from overcom-
