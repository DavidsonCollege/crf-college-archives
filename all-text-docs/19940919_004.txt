SGA to benefit from new freshmen senators

SGA continued from page 1

made the decision to keep all six on
the Council. The top six sopho-
mores, however, had not been in-
formed when the mistake was dis-
covered, so the SGA re-ran the
election on Tuesday, requesting
that voters choose four names in-
stead of six.

The six new junior Honor
Council members are: Jason
Byassee, Lexy DeVane, Marc
LaFrance, Karl Ruch, Alexis West,
and Ed White. The four new sopho-
more representatives are: Katie
Brasfield, Ann Chandler, Jeremy
Chason, and Ashley Gribble.

SGA and Honor Council offi-
cials don’t think the mix-up is an
issue of concern, SGA President
Eric Rosenbach says, “The over-
sight of a past president will not in

any way affect the overall effec-
tiveness of the Honor Council.”
Allison Sabel, SGA Vice-Presi-
dent, says, “Since the-council is
now larger than before, there are
more members to choose from to
conduct trials, and it will be easier
than ever to elect representatives
who aren’t involved in the case at
hand.”

The SGA plans to correct the
Honor Council bylaws to reflect
the election procedures informally
adopted three years ago.

’ Elections for Independent

‘ Senators and freshman Senators

were conducted without any prob-
lems. Eighteen students competed
for the six spaces available in the
freshman Senator. The candidate
who received the most votes be-
came the president of the class, and

the following eleven candidates
were placed back on the ballot for
the runoffs Tuesday.

After the polls closed and bal-
lots were counted, the victors were
discovered: Buster Burk, President;
Demian Dellinger, Lucian Dervan,
Patricia Evans, Susannah Herndon,
and Colin Kelly, senators. Four
independent senators were also
elected: Saad Gul, President; Disco
Dan Mojonnier; Jonathon Orr and
Dennis Seavers.

New Freshman Senator
Dervan says, “It has been said that
our class had the largest turnout of
voters in Davidson’s history. This
doesn’t surprise me. I believe that
this class is one of the most unified
classes the school has ever seen.”

The SGA meets on Tuesdays
at 9:00 p.m. in the Union Confer-
ence Room.
