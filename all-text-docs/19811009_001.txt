High technology

Unveiling the new computer system

by Hunter Monroe ’84

This summer. Davidson, College

~ entered'the modem age'of computing.”

By- acquiring two Prime computers,
the College has jumped two genera-
tions of computer technology. The im-
provements over the old system are
vast and numerous.

The new system consists of a

-Prime 750 Computer for acedemic use,

and a Prime 450 Computer for admi-
nisrtative use. They are located-in the
new Computer Center behind the Post
Office.

The two sytems will be enough to
handle 32 users at any given time.

The computers will store most of
their information on disc drives. A disc
drive records memory on a stack of
large rigid discs and bears a strong re-
semblance to a washing machine.

Long term memory storage can be
done on magnetic tapes, using a tape
drive.

- Users will communicate with the.
computer using video terminals that |

will be in various locations on the cam-
pus. These terminals consist of a video
screen, a keyboard, and a little black

‘box to connect the terminal to the com-

puter.
Several printers will also be scat-

‘tered around in useful locations. A
high-speed printer, to be located in the
. ‘Computer center itself, will-print at a
Staggering Tate of 600 lines per minute.

"The old system does not compare

Z well against the new one.

It consisted of-a PDP/8f and an

NER Century 101. The NCR was the

marion bine and was used excla-

sively by the administration. Com-
puter Center Director Robert Desieno
describes both these computers as “old
and:impoverishéed.” ©

The average time for the comple-
tion of a job on the old system was
three days, while the expected run-on
time for the new system will be a mat-
ter of minutes or seconds.

The memory capacity of the new
system is about 100 times that of the
old.

The old system did not have a tape
drive. Magnetic tape is extremely por-
table and will allow for the transporta-
tion of large amounts of information to
and from other universities and com-
puter centers.

The new computer can handie
more programming languges than the
old computer did. The PDP had a poor
version of BASIC and the NCR had the
COBOL, FORTRAN IV, RPG, and
NEAT/3 ‘languages. The new. system
offers two versions of BASIC, two
versions .of .FORTRAN, PASCAL,
COBOL, and assembly language, (As-
sembly language is a very simple lan-
guage, one step away from the compu-
ter’s language.)

A Statistical -package, called
SPSS, will be useful in analyzing lagre
amounts of data.

,. Another big advantage of the new
computer’ is its use of video terminals
rather than: punch eards. The terminals

allow direct contact with the computer

by each’ user... This arrangement is

‘called . interactive computing. ‘The
