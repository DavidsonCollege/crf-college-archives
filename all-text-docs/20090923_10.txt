played well in road games at Richmond and Virginia Tech, but lost both games 3-2.

’Cats come up just short in Virginia

Two consecutive trips to Virginia last
weekend handed the women’s soccer team
two close losses, both by 3-2 tallies. While
the Davidson offense controlled the contest
against Richmond on Friday, the team faced
relentless pressure from Virginia Tech on
Sunday.

In both contests, the team surrendered
two quick goals in the first half, forcing the
*Cats to play from behind. For the majority
of each game, the players maintained con-
stant composure while occasional slip-ups
compromised the team’s otherwise solid per-
formances.

The Richmond Spiders broke the field
open less than 12 minutes into Friday’s
game, dashing into the clear 10 feet in front
of the net and ripping their first goal of the
game. A frazzled Davidson D gave up a sec-
ond score in the 23rd minute, as the home
team exploited their confidence advantage
with brisk passing.

Just when the first half seemed to turn
lopsided, the Wildcat offense turned on the
jets. Fast. It took only 12 and a half minutes
for Blakely Low ’10 to rip an unassisted shot
from 20 feet out. Her score set in motion a
180-degree shift in momentum, while the
*Cats racked up several more shots and two
corners before the end of the half.

Judging straight by the numbers, the
*Cats controlled the flow of the first half
after their early errors. They would con-
tinue to dominate it for the rest of the game.
Richmond only managed four shots in each
period, while Davidson whipped out 10 in
the first half alone. This season hasn’t been
about making opportunities, but capitalizing
on them.

The second half shined a bright light on
Wildcat offense, which pummeled the Spi-

cate Z0Und

ders with shot after shot. Halfway through
the period, Julia Calhoun °13 connected for
her first ever collegiate goal, off a header
assisted by Callan Elswick 711. It was a tie
game, 2-2.

Both teams played desperation soccer,
exchanging shot for shot in the final minutes.
But a blown whistle in the 78th minute would
secure the game for the Spiders—a foul in
the box led to a penalty kick resulting in the
home team’s go-ahead goal.

Sunday’s game handed the ‘Cats a dose
of déja vu—complete with an early defen-
sive breakdown and a late-game near-come-
back. Following another long drive up I-77,
the team entered a hostile environment in
Blacksburg, VA, against a team with a score
to settle. Davidson took a W at home last
year versus the Hokies.

The second match of the weekend road
trip witnessed two goals in short order,
again—one in the eighth minute and anoth-
er in the 38th. Again, the Cats had to fight
back from behind, 2-0. Jessie Baxa ’12, who
took over in the second half of the Richmond
game, aggressively resisted the 19 shots from
the Virginia Tech offense, 13 in the first half.
She tallied five saves in the game.

A smooth score by a Hokie forward in
minute 53 seemed to put the game out of
reach.

Kyri Bye-Nagel ’10 led an offense charge
in the 72nd minute, streaking straight up the
middle through Tech’s defensive front. Just
outside the box, she dished a pass over to the
side to Suzanne Sittko ’10. Upon seeing an
over-confident goalie come out on the ball,
Sittko redirected the pass into the back of the
net for her first goal of the year.

The ’Cats weren’t through yet. Fired up
from her first offensive statement, Sittko
took on a charitable role, sending a cross in
