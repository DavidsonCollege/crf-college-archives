On Tuesday, the college admin-
istration announced that the char-
ters of all Patterson Court organi-
zations had been revoked. The
houses will be demolished to make
way for the new
Duke Family
Medical Center.
The decision
came after a long-
fought battle
between mem-
bers of Patterson
Court and_ the
school’s adminis-
trators.

“Patterson
Court has been a
huge liability for
the school ever
since that goose
incident,” said
college president
Wendy Greene.
“It has been a
constant source
of problems.”

Administrators felt Patterson
Court had a negative influence on
the attractiveness of the college to
both current members of the col-
lege community and to prospective
students.

“Prospective students who
learned about Patterson Court’s
bad reputation became upset and
generally thought worse of the col-
lege,” said Dean of Admissions
Rodney Houser. “The students felt
that the interior design of most
Patterson Court houses lacked
pleasing aesthetic qualities.”

To date, the administration has
adopted a policy of targeting indi-
vidual houses for their aesthetic
failings. Several houses were

According to many school and
campus safety officials, Davidson’s
stray cat population has become a
problem, and the problem isn’t
going away. An outside agency has
been called in to address the prob-
lem.

“It’s a little ironic that we have
too many ‘cats’ on campus,” Dean
of Students Dwayne Richards said
earlier this week. “Despite the
campus’s strong desire to provide
an environmentally friendly
atmosphere, these ‘wild cats’ need
to go.”

Catsafe Industries, maker of the
Cat Carrier series, is looking to
help solve the campus cat overpop-
ulation.

Eddie Harden, the Catsafe rep-
resentative in charge of the
Davidson evaluation, has high
hopes for success.

“People normally think cats are
pretty cute. They're dainty and
soft, and they purr and lick milk
from bowls. People don’t realize
they go through garbage, steal
from the Union Cafe, and sell illic-
it drugs to schoolchildren. And

members of organizations to con-
form to our new interior design
policies,” said Associate Dean Jane
Romano. “The more we investigat-
ed, however, the more violations of
these rules we found. The corrup-
tion of interior design principles
was so widespread that we were
forced to shut down Patterson
Court entirely.”

The new design policies were
instated in Spring ’03 following the
‘goose incident,’ in which one fra-
ternity attempted to mount a
stuffed goose over their fireplace, a
direct violation of the existing inte-
rior design rules. Patterson Court
organizations were given three
years to comply with these new
regulations, which, according to

they do it all with a sinister smile
on their face,” he said.

Both Harden and Richards think
this may be the safest and most
effective solution to the current
crisis on campus.

“Once they run out of food
sources, they start attacking stu-
dents and small children.” Harden
said. “Three stray cats can digest
an entire adult male in about six
hours.” »

School officials have yet to make
a final decision on Catsafe’s offer,
but the debate over the cruel and
unusual treatment of the cats is a
hot-button issue on the Davidson
campus. Students and faculty alike
have expressed mixed opinions.

“I didn’t think the cats were a
problem. I kind of liked them.
They were furry and cute,” said
Jamie Troyer, ’08. “I play with
them all the time, and it’s super
fun.”

Troyer, who has a soft spot in
her heart for animals, said remov-
ing the cats will not solve the prob-
lem.

“They eat mice, don’t they? Do

‘Then I saw its eyes,

the college administration, they
have not done.

“The new design policies are
ridiculous,” said Sigma Eta Psi
member Howard Mitchell ’06.
“Not only are
they convoluted
and difficult to
understand, but
they _ actually
lead to more
abuses of design
principles.
Because the
rules are so
rigid, if students
feel the need to
exercise _ their
creative design
impulses, they
have to go to off
campus houses
or sample wall-
paper swatches
in secret. It is a
-far less healthy
way to practice interior design.”

Despite student protest, the
administration has officially decid-
ed to remove the current Patterson
Court organizations and their
houses.

“With. the construction of the
Alvarez Campus Center and the
recent renovations to Chambers
and Commons; the Davidson com-
munity has come to expect more
out of the interior design of our
buildings,” said Romano.
“Patterson Court hindered the
school’s progress in this area. By
removing the terrible influence of
Patterson Court, not only will we
beautify an ugly part of the school,
but we will also eliminate the neg-
ative influence that it also had on

and perhaps a

alcohol abuse, sexual misconduct
and landscaping.”

The proposed Duke Family
Medical Center will be a three-
story medical center designed to
help attract more potential pre-
medical students to the college.

“The Med Center should benefit
the school far more than the
Patterson Court organizations ever
did,” said Chemistry professor
Sheila Barnes. “Not only will it
provide a steady revenue from the
recent increase in students suffer-
ing from alcohol poisoning, but the
interior will be designed by the
famous French interior decorator
Jaques d’Etat.”

“Our hope is that this whole
process will get rid of Davidson’s
reputation as more of a ‘party
school’ than one committed to aca-
demics,” said Greene.

“The corruption
of interior design
principles was so
widespread that

we were forced to
shut down
Paterson Court.”

“Patterson Court is currently
located on a very prime spot of
land right in the heart of the cam-
pus,” said Mitchell. “Just like the
body, when you replace the heart
of the campus, you are altering
what makes it tick.”

President Gary Snipes expects to
