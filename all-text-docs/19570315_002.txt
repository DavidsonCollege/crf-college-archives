Plans for the newly proposed Fra
ternity Court as presented in last week’s
Davidsonian have been generally re-
ceived with interest, but with definite
reservations.

The objections raised are the expec-
ted. ones. First of all, fraternity men
naturally prefer the single units over the
duplexes, for numerous and obvious
reasons. Secondly, the failure of the plans
to provide for a chapter room or a similar
area has been pointed out.

While the main living room in the
proposed unit is considerably larger than
the total floor space in the present
houses, it seems desirable to have at least
two distinct rooms available for day-by-
day use in the houses.

This week we propose an alternate
plan which we believe would satisfactor-
ily meet the objections raised concerning
the original proposals of last week, and

would still be financially feasible.
™ s = we =

Single Units Cost $25,000

The cost of building the universally
preferred single unit houses as shown
last week would run in the vicinity of
$25,000. This cost includes individual
kitchen facilities and dietician quarters
in addition to the dining room and living
room, either one of which alone would
be larger by some 200 square feet than
the total floor space in the present house,
including both and living and chapter
rooms, ;

One of the big objections to the pre-
sented plans could be met with the addi-
tion of an unfinished basement for each
unit, which could be used as a chapter
room, and as a television and ping-pong
area if so desired. Such a basement, of
approximately’ 900 square feet, would
cost an additional $5,000.

e * *

$30,000 With Basements

So for roughly $30,000 apiece, each
fraternity could be furnished an attrac-
tive single unit, which would provide, ex-
clusive of kitchen and dietician living
area, a house with floor space almost four
‘times that of the present cottages on
Fraternity Court, and a living area of a
little over 1800 square feet as compared
with only approximately 730 square feet
now available.

With these provisions, it seems likely
that most fraternity men would jump at
the chance to see such an arrangement
put into operation.

But as it now stands, the cost of fi-

$100,000 Fund-Raising Campaign
Would Make Single Units Possible

nancing of such a program of sweeping
improvements is prohibitive. If the fra-
ternities, however, could somehow raise
the difference between the cost of a sin-
gle-unit-with-basement program and the
cheaper and financially feasible duplex-
without-basement plan, the finances
would again be within reasonable reach.

A coordinated fund-raising cam-
paign by the Davidson fraternities seems

to be a logical and practical answer.
»- ss ® # «@

$100,000 Would Do It

$100,000 could make the difference
between the two proposals. With enthusi-
astic support and a lot of hard work,
there is no good reason why such sum
could not be secured.

Quotas could be assigned to each fra-
ternity on the basis of its living alumni,

and since the money would technically-

go to the College, though earmarked for
this project, donations would be tax-de-
ductable, thus making contributing con-
siderably more attractive.

With this money secured, the plan
could be put within the financial reach
of members, of smaller fraternities by
dividing equally among all fraternity men
the total monthly rental costs on the new
court, instead of charging each fraternity

a flat sum, whether composed of 30 or:

80 men. '

Since every man would be furnished
with identical facilities, such a scheme

seems completely fair.
s s e a

$3.50 Per Man Per Month

Assuming that $100.000 could be
raised, and the remaining cost is divided
equally among a hypothetical 850 fra-
ternity men which we should easily have
in the near future, the cost for such a
spacious single unit with basement per
man per month would be roughly in the
neighborhood of $3.50. In interpreting
this figure, we should remember that
this would not be a flat increase of
$3.50 to the present dues, since fraternity
men are already: paying rent on fra-
ternity houses and boarding houses,
which would be done away with if the
switch were made.

The key to such a Fraternity Court,
which we feel would amply meet the
needs of an expanding fraternity system
for years to come, lies in the raising of
$100,000. If a such a Court finds favor
with the Student Body, a concerted and
united fraternity effort couid secure the
money.

Honors--Apex Of The Curriculum

There are many opportunities and ad-
vantages in attending a Liberal Arts
school. One of the outstanding phases
of Davidson’s program is the Honors Pro-
gram, discussed in detail on page three.

There is some feeling among mem-
bers of the faculty and relatively fewer
students that there is room for more in-
tensive work to be done on the junior and
senior levels. In the first two years, they
feel, most of the men are made to exert
themselves to meet the rather stiff re-
quirements established.

When the last two years arrive, how-
ever, there is more room for sloughing
off all but the major courses and sort of
“coasting in.” The arguments for both
sides can be presented logically.

In an effort to provide an avenue for
those students who rank high in their
class and who demonstrate more than
usual interest to work at a faster rate
and do more independent study, the
honors program was established.

In the first place, the added emphasis

on individual research and a taste of
graduate level work is invaluable for stu-
dents planning further training. The fact
that the class load is lightened consider-
ably calls for greater discipline and ap-
plication on the student's part.

Secondly, the greater part of the read-
ing and all the papers can be approached
from the participant’s particular interest
field. This prevents becoming “bogged
down’’ in the mass of material it is neces-
sary to cover.

There is much to be said for the
broad picture as opposed to the more
narrow approach dictated by reviews and
constant writs. The informal atmosphere,
extending into the professor’s home, also
produces a milieu more conducive to
good work. .

It is a program which has many in-
teresting angles. Davidson, as a sort of
pioneer in this area, should take pride
in the success it has had with Honors.
Certainly the record of graduates speaks
for itself.—F.L.H.

As we stand at this juncture
of Davidson history, can we but
be impressed that it is one of
unusual significance. Perhaps at
no time in the last few decades
have so many determining factors
culminated to make a single junc-
ture such as ours of such im-

Even the most casual observer

light of the pending choice of
a new president, the approval of
the Ten Year Plan calling for
construction of seven new build-
ings and raising ten million dol-

lars, the coming increased enroll-
ment, and the proposed change in
the fraternity plant.

If this moment carries such po-

require of those in the present
student generation? What else but

MORE HEAT THAN LIGHT?

Time Has Come To Examine

Election System With Open Mind

By BILL DANIEL

The furor that has been raised
during the past few weeks with
regard to election procedures at
Davidson College has unfortunately
. ° created more
heat than light.
We have seen
ay amendments
¥ and suggestions
; 2 come and go
Pu ey’ without thought

and understand-
i ing on our part
as students.
Daniel ‘The time has
come—not %o wait until next year
—but to discuss and analyze the
strengths and weaknesses of the
system under which we operate
while it operates. and to try to
work out improvements and
changes which will result in the
realization of established goals.

Suggested Changes

The present arrangement has
the following weaknesses:

(1) Lack of opportunity to
become acquainted with a
candidate's views and inten-
tions. In spite of our “family
atmosphere,” there are many
candidates that ! frankly do
not know.

What purpose they have in run-
ning for an office, what their con-
ception of that office is, what. they
hope to achieve if elected—all
this is left to conjecture in many
cases. One is reduced to election-
by-acquaintance or by fortuitous
fraternity affiliation.

Only the student body president
finalists have this opportunity,
and the ineptness of this is ob-
vious. What is needed is an ex-
change of questions and answers.

(2) Lack of interest on the
part of the student body as
a whole. This element can be
seen in the vote turnout eith-
er at the Union or in the
lobby of Chambers, end in the
general student attitude.

This is naturally a problem that
pervades any electoral system, but
this makes it no less of a prob-
lem on the local scene.

(3) The tack of a reolistic
approach to elections and

campsigning. For some rea-
son, to campaign is construed
as undesirable within our
tight little framework, and
conducive to “moral sin.”

Elections are interpreted as the
vox populi in one spontaneous
intuitive grasp of insight as to
who is the “right” man. By his
works ye shall know him. Unfor-
tunately again, either I do not
get around that much or the chos-
en has passed me by. This con-
ception seems utterly unrealistic.

Let us take these points as goals
or ends: opportunity to know the
candidates, a real interest from
the student body, a realistic ap-
proach to procedure, and see what
means have been suggested for
their realization.

'

Compromise Asked

Various methods have been sug-
gested. Open campaigning with
limitations (unspecified) was _re-
jected—and I feel rightly. This ap-
pears as an extreme which would
in itself create problems of con-
trol that would be all but impos-
sible to regulate. While one may
point to other schools that permit
this, for the most part their elec-
torate is composed of Independents
upon which political parties wield
their propaganda weapons. Be-
longing to no fraternal order, they
are not subject to any rigid con-

called that) is complete apathy or
conservatism. Why change? Can
anyone really complain about the
calibre of men elected in the past?

This is the type of argument
promulgated by those who ignore
the fact that perfection has yet
to be achieved and who refuse
to realize that standing still may
be stagnation as well as determi-
nation. The above mentioned
problems still remain whether we
close our eyes or not. This is not
a solution but a disease.

Present Weaknesses

Some suggestions | think
sre particularly good. For ex-
ample, in his article of March
1, Tom Morgen suggested the
possibility of “forums (at
which) the candidates would
be allowed to express their
views and answer questions
from the floor.”

This is a realistic solution and
not an impossible one. This would
be a type of campaigning that
would achieve the ends in view
and also prevent the dangers in-
herent in open campaigning. The
plan would answer the first prob-
lem mentioned; and if conducted

‘in the right manner, would affect

the second.

The first step in the right di-
rection has been made with the
successful movement of voting to

Gift Fund

our sincere appreciation to the faculty and student body for the

trol by any combine. Davidson is
far from such a situation.

This again would not insure an
opportunity to know apy one but
campaign managers. Also the free-
dom of anyone to run for an of-
fice would be seriously threatened
if parties or combines were
allowed.

the Union. Voting is no long-
er a thoughtless response to a
ballot shoved into the hand. Let
us not stop here, however, but
continue to search for the sys-
tem best suited to our needs.

But now is the time to examine,
analyze, and discuss. Let us ap-
proach the problem with an open
mind so that we might grow with,
not against, the times.

enlightenment possible so that the
future may judge our actions as
ones that made a better Davidson.

In the current proposal for a
new fraternity court, the student
body is presented with the op-
portunity to make a choice that
will greatly influence the nature
of the fraternity system of the fu-
ture, if not the entire social pat-
tern at Davidson. In view of this,
it then seems that we are chal-
lenged to make as rational and
as enlightened a decision as pos-
sible.

it appears, however, that
we are on the verge of mak-
ing this choice on a concep-
tion based primarily on the
evident need of change, but
little more. It is questionable
that this choice is in the best
interest of the future, for the
alternatives are actually no
more than a bigger super-
structure built on the current
foundation. It is this very
foundation thet is of ques-
tionable strength.

It can be conceded that the so-
cial system at Davidson is “un-
realistic.” With the official head-
in-the-sand attitude, a “realistic”
system is impossible, for only a
recognized problem can be re
solved. The problems and ques-
tionable aspects of the Davidson
social system are prodigious, but

there is no evident effort to meet,
or even recognize them.

This situation makes one de-
mand: to make a constructive ef-
fort to analyze, evaluate, and for.
mulate solutions to our virtually ‘
incoherent social pattern. It-is dif-
ficult to see why this inadequate
pattern should be maintained.

This demand can best be
realized by a competent com-
mittee combining students and
faculty in an effort to evalu-
ate the present system to its
roots. What is its purpose?
How is it functioning? What
role should the Union play?
What are the problems of
other colleges and how are
they being solved? It would
require time; but not only
does its ratio to future time
justify it, it requires it.

The administration has present-
ed the students with the responsi-
bility of gauging the character of
the Davidson social pattern. It is

highly questionable if a respon-
sible choice can be made without
total evaluation.

Those who are currently pro-
fessing an interest in Davidson
have here an opportunity to mani-
fest this interest by joining in a
tangible movement for a better
Davidson.

LETTER TO EDITOR

Candidate Should Be
Able To Air Views

Dear Editor,

The recent fervor concerning
the defeated Peden Amendment
has brought to the attention of
the students the fact that a can-
didate for a student body office at
Davidson has no chance to attract
votes in his behalf.

I am in sympathy with the
democratic goal as was sought by
the Peden Amendment; however,
I could not support it because of
the unsatisfactory restrictions that
it provided. The inevitable innova-
tion of strong fraternity cliques
would have been its natural by-
product, and I feel that such cli-
ques would have destroyed the
unique elections system of David-
son.

However, { feel compelled
to offer criticism of the elec-
tions system es it now stands.
it is absolutely impossible for
an upperclassman, or any stu-
dent, to present his name to
the electorate for serious con-
sideration without “soliciting
votes.” To solicit votes would
be to automatically defeat
himself. Vet how is a student
able to let the electorate
know that he is willing and
anxious to serve them?

As it stands now it seems that
only those students whose names
have become associated with stu-

.

Needless to say, there is con-
siderable agitation among the
members of the student body for
some changes in the elections sys-
tem. Dozens of students have
spoken to the members of the
elections board about changes
which they feel are sorely need-
ed.

The most voiced complaint
seems to be that students often
do not even know the men who
are running for office. This has
prompted many voters not to mark
their ballots under certain offices.
Others mark the ballot, but do
so completely ignorant of the
qualifications of the candidates.
Some of these choose to cast their
ballot for the man with the most
letters in his name or at a certain
place on the list. Clearly such a
situation as this needs to be
remedied.

I will agree with them that cam-

the amendment voted on_ this

though, I urge that the students,

cil, consider the possibility of a
forum and distribution of limited

posed two weeks ago and Mr.
