by a tragic fire. Funds were raised
quickly by the community to put him
back in business. The town cared.

New housing was sponsored for lower
income families, with citizens working
with the local bank, a local endowment
fund, the College, and the Federal
government to construct over 60 homes.
In so doing, the biggest part of the
housing blight in the town was elimi-
nated. Those on the steering committee
and those being assisted were friends
before this project began; they remain
friends today.

A need for day care services resulted
in a genuine outpouring or love, money,
volunteer carpenters and brick masons,
etc. We now have one of the finest day
care facilities and services anywhere.

And we all remember the gentle little
lady, who was born in this town, walking
slowly down Concord Road from her
family’s Victorian home, carrying a bag
of clothes and food. She would cross
Main Street, go down Bradey’s Alley,
and end in the heart of the black
community. There she would minister to
the needs of a family who had sick
members or who was down on its luck.
Everyone knew what she was doing.
There was no fanfare about it. She just

did it.

These acts of kindness, of knowing

your fellow citizen and his strengths and
needs, are more numerous than anyone
other than the Almighty will ever know.

Certainly this quality is not unique to
Davidson. It exists in other places. But
the fact is that it does exist in Davidson.
This community is a place where it is
possible to know most of the people who
share the proud title of ‘‘resident of
Davidson.’’ And to paraphrase the late
Senator L.Q.C. Lamar, ‘‘to know your
neighbor is to love your neighbor.’”’ You
cannot ignore or disregard the joys and
needs of your neighbors...if you know
your neighbors.

I was raised in Central Florida, a
beautiful part of this country. Yet, with
the Disney World explosion and NASA
importing literally thousands of new-
comers very quickly, ‘‘developments”’
sprang up everywhere. Plans for ‘‘Rock-
et City,” a city of tomorrow, to be built
between Orlando and Cocoa Beach, were

announced; the land was cleared, streets _

were paved without proper drainage,
model homes were constructed, and the
“re-entry’’ into the world of reality came
as fast as bankruptcy was declared, and

Town Of Davidson

December 19, 1980—The Davidsonian—7

Other developments were financially
more successful. But they became
enclaves unto themselves, not part of the
existing community. A respect for those
traditional concerns of neighbors and
neighborhoods was not forthcoming.
They were identified only a ‘‘such-and-
such development.’’ These same people
voted, of course, in the national e-
lections. Most importantly, they voted
in the local elections. And with the
absence of any assimilation into the
community proper, division came. Those
who had worked long and hard for the
good of the community over the years
were turned out of office. The “new
folks’’ were now in charge.

The land which SYNCO plans to
develop is ideal for residential develop-
ment. It is beautiful land. Yet, it should
be remembered that the town of David-
son has fewer than 800 registered voters.
This high density project will bring in
900 families, or potentially 2,000-3,000
new voters. When the entire area is
taken into the town limits, the voting
strength of those who have worked to
make this town desirable so that SYNCO
would want to develop the land could be
powerless.

This does not have to happen to

Davidson. Growth is going to come to
Davidson, and that is probably good.
But it must be slow and orderly growth.
Each year we welcome new citizens to
this town. The spirit of concern for your
neighbor can be fostered and can
flourish. Adequate time between build-
ing phases gives time for residents of the
town to make their way out to the ‘‘new
folks,” to get them involved in town
projects, civic clubs, church circles,
Scout troops, etc. It allows for the ever
expanding circle of friends, of neighbors,
to become a reality.

Edmund Burke several hundred years
ago worded the problem, the opportuni-
ty, correctly: ‘“‘To be attached to the
subdivision, to love the little platoon we
belong to in society, is the first principle
(the germ, as it were) of public affection.
It is the first link by which we proceed to
a love of our country, and of mankind.”

What kind of town will you come back
to in the year 2,000 A.D.? It can be the
same, only better. As Jamie Wyeth so
eloquently said: ‘‘Working within the
framework of a strong tradition can
produce many achievements that create
their own tradition.’’ It is a tradition I

DAV drive nets $35,955

WDAV's recent fundraising drive met and surpassed its
$35,000 goal receiving $35,955 in pledges from 1103 donors,
according to station Community Relations Director Henry Doss.

“We're particularly excited at the number of new donors—over
450,’’ Doss said.

Station Director Ed McIntyre pointed out that students and
community members put in more than 500 volunteer man-hours
during the drive.

Drill called a success

The town of Davidson’s participation in the December 6 nuclear
evacuation drill was successful ‘‘as far as it went,” according to
Civil Preparedness Director Robert Manning.

Manning said town rescue personnel performed as expected in
the drill, which simulated evacuation procedures following an
accident at McGuire Nuclear Power Plant. .

Over two hundred people participated in the drill, according to
the North Meck Newspaper. No figures are available on
participation by Davidson citizens.

No one raised substantive problems with the drill at a follow-up
meeting, Manning said. ‘‘I don’t foresee any major changes in the
town’s plan,’’ he added. _

Once the public schools decide on their evacuation procedures,
the town will write a final version of its plan. All residents will
receive information including maps, instructions, and telephone
numbers.

A few towns activated their warning sirens before official
notification from the county on Saturday, Manning said. However,
Davidson was not among them.

Kelley & Iles win Wildcat Handbook job

Juniors Barbara Kelley and
Donna Iles will be Wildcat
Handbook editors next year.
Kelley and Iles defeated Steve
Carter and Patti Long in Tues-
day’s election by a vote of 436
to 319.

Kelley and Iles said their top
priority is to meet their dead-
lines. Iles said they expect
pages to be ready for printing
by the end of the school year.
The Handbook should be com-

ities, Epes said. ‘I think it’s
commonly understood that the
faculty has a responsibility in
this area.”’

One argument in favor of a
committee, Epes said, is that
“if the faculty’s goal is educa-
tional quality they should help
determine their own make-up.”

Epes added, ‘‘a slightly inde-
pendent faculty committee (is
seen as) a further guarantor of
due process in tenure deci-
sions.”’

denial of tenure in Spring 1979

The current pages describing

ship (DCF) will be condensed,

er clubs and student activities

Included in each activity des-

was likely to have an effect on
the faculty’s decision, Epes said
there was no specific mention of
the decision at the meeting.
“It’s probably in the back of
people’s minds,’’ he added.

Concerns raised about the
committee at Tuesday’s meet-
ing included questions about
‘‘how much voice it would
have,’’ Epes said.

Some professors are afraid
the committee would disrupt
Davidson's sense of community
by asking faculty members to
pass judgment on one another.
Committee members would also
have access to confidential ma-
terials about tenure candidates.

Another concern, Epes said,

is that faculty members who
had gained an understanding of
the Administration’s priorities
in contract renewal decisions
would have to face a new set of
priorities when the faculty com-
mittee evaluated them. |

The College must also clarify
the role of the candidate’s

department in evaluation for

tenure, Epes added.

The Administration ‘tends to
favor’’ increased faculty partici-
pation in tenure decisions, ac-
cording to Epes. ‘‘There is
faculty participation now, but
this would be a matter of
putting it into a structure.”

A page of basic information
about Davidson will include

places to study, Kelly said. The

Kelley emphasized that they
would have a ‘‘great’’ cover but
added they had not come to any
firm decision about it. Iles said
students interested in writing
essays about Slater food ser-
vice, academics, or other rele-
vant topics should call them.

Lakeland, Florida, is a hall

Kelly is from Hartsville, South
