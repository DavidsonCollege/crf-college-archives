Duke Versus

Davidson

By Jason Byassee

It’s the last weekend in March.

The pleasant weather outside the
building signals the eminent ar-
rival of Spring, with its frivolities
and care-free attitudes. Inside,
things are a little different.
_ The building is the newly-
renovated Greensboro Coliseum,
home of the 1994 East Regional
Semifinals. The electricity in the
crowd and the intensity on each
face signal the importance of the
contest. It’s the “Sweet 16,” an all-
important stage in the stretch run
for college basketball’s Final Four.
The two teams that are matched
seem an unlikely pair.

Duke University, in its usual
dominant post-season form, has
just won the ACC tournament and
is the top seed in the East Region.
The Blue Devils’ opponent has
been named the tournament’s
“Cinderella” team, and nobody
outside the Davidson, NC area ever
expected them to get this far. It's
Duke versus Davidson, head to
head in the NCAA tournament.

The Wildcats are on an unbe-
lievable roll, having won fourteen
of their last fifteen games and the
Southern Conference Champion-
ship. A pair of upsets over Georgia
Tech and Illinois in the tourna-
ment has landed them a birth in the
Sweet 16, with all the media atten-
tion that results from America’s
dove for the underdog. Whatever
the sports magazines and newspa-
pers say, however, this Davidson
basketball team never considers
itself an underdog.

Neither team is downplaying
the other before the game, but the
Vegas bookies sure are talking.
They make Davidson 18-point un-
derdogs, despite the Cats’ recent
winning ways. Dick Vitale is talk-
ing, too, promising to sing soprano
on ESPN if the Cats manage to
knock off the Devils.

The stage is set and the day
has come. As the teams approach
the jump circle, even the casual
observer senses that this could be a
mismatch. What are Duke and
Davidson doing on the same court?

To be continued next week...

Carolyn Kirsch admits that
she was nervous about competing
at the NCAA Division I level.
The freshman from Heidelberg,
Germany had some doubts about
coming to play basketball in the
United States: “Inever really knew
about the competition for girls!
basketball in the states, and I re-
ally had no clue as to where I
stood as far as being able to play.
It was going to be a new experi-
ence, andI wasn’t really sure how
I was going to fit in.”

Kirsch also admits that ad-
justing to college level play was.
difficult. She was used to her role
in high school and said, “Having
to come here to Davidson and
Start all over again and try to es-
tablish myself, that was the hard-
est thing. And just trying to find
my role as a team member.”

Kirsch not only had to adjust
to.college level play, but she also
had to adapt to a new position.
Coach John Filar decided to use
her power inside and make her a
forward: “We originally thought
that we were going to have her
‘play on the perimeter, but with
her type of power game, we
thought it would be best for us to
move her inside.” Kirsch says at
first she was frustrated with the
new position: “I really didn’thave
a lot of confidence (as a forward).
I was really frustrated at the be-
ginning of the season because the
moves just weren’t there quite
yet.”

Kirsch struggled in her first
game as a Wildcat when she had
only four points and no rebounds.

Now it seems, however, that her
moves are there. She has gained
confidence as a forward and has
put together some amazing games.
Against Washington and Lee,
Kirsch had 20 points, 10 rebounds,
and 11 steals, and she played only
19 minutes. Her triple-double was
the first ever for a Davidson
women’s basketball player. She
also had two. great back to back
games against Radford and West-
ern Carolina when she scored 17
points and had 11 rebounds in each
of those games. Kirsch had 13
points and 17 rebounds on Satur-
day night against UT-Chattanooga.
“Since I’ve been starting, I’ve just
had more confidence, and I have
been so much more collected on
the court.”

The team has really come to
depend on Kirsch for her rebounds

‘ and intensity as well as her physi-

cal play. “She will run through a
brick wall for you,” said Coach
Filar. “Her game is a power game,
but at the same time, she has the
finesse about her that makes her
really difficult to stop. She has one
of the quickest first steps to the
basket, and she is very tenacious
on rebounding the ball.”

When asked about her inten-
sity. Kirsch said, “I love to play
basketball... I expect myself to do
well, and I just want to go out there
and give it all I have, ....and if I
don’t, I get down on myself.”

Kirsch has made some sig-
nificant improvements since the
beginning of the year. Coach Filar
mentioned that “her ability to read
the defense inside has gotten better
with each game. Being able to tell

when she needs to kick the ball out
and when she can go to the basket
with the ball, that’s definitely im-
proved. And I think probably the
biggest improvement in her game
has been her confidence...Kirsch
is just going to continue to get
better inside.” Kirsch may have
come with some doubts as to
whether she should be playing Di-

vision I basketball. By the looks

of her play, however, it seems as
if Kirsch’s confidence is only |
going to grow. “Finally I’m feel-
ing more comfortable playing. I
mean I love it...It’s so fun.” She
should no longer feel uncertain as
to whether she really belongs at a
Division I program. She defi-
nitely does.

Indoor track teams break several school records at ETSU

By Jean DeMoss &
Jeff George

The Wildcat thinclads trav-
elled to Johnson City this past
weekend to compete in the South-
ern Conference Indoor track meet.
As the temperature soared to 78
degrees outside, the track team
competed at ETSU’s indoor track.
Running against stiff competition,
the men’s and women’s team
boasted a number of outstanding
performances and broke several
school records.

The men posted a 3:30.1 in the
mile relay to break a school record.
Duncan Spears (51 3), James Berry

(52.1), Jeff George (53.7) and Eric

_ McMichael (53.0) brought home

the fastest indoor relay in Davidson
history with a gritty performance.
Spears (51.6) and Berry (52.5)
posted top-notch timesin the 400m.
Spears will graduate with more
than half of the top ten indoor
400m performances, including the
school record that he set last year.
_ ‘In addition to Berry, several
other freshmen had solid perfor-
mances, led by Chris Machon
(9:11) in the 300m and (16:06) in
the 5000m. Eugene Jung threw the
shot 42’9”, a huge improvement
from earlier in the season. Dave

Foss doubled in the 3000m and
5000m along with sophomore Eric
Collings. Frosh Clay Lenhart
joined them in the 5000m.
Junior co-captain Eric
McMichael ran a personal best of
1:57inthe 800m. Patrick Fernando
and George followed with solid
in the 800m. In the mile run,
freshmen Mike Coyle and Ken
Kiser competed for the wildcats.
For the women, Carolyn
Meadows (11:22) and Erin Roach
(11:28) kicked off the meet on
Friday afternoon with strong per-
formances in the 3000m. Lara

Burkholder also competed in the

long jump and flew 17 feet.
Burkholder quickly made the tran-
sition to the 55m dash and re-broke
her own record. She posted a
speedy time of 7.71. Sophomore
Annie Parsons continued to lower
her 800m time by posting a 2:46.

Deciding to stack the distance
medley relay and run fast, the
women chased the school record,
As the “ASU coach later com-
mented, “the women’s DMR
looked very impressive.” Phuong
Nguyen was the lead off leg for the
Cats. She ran a 2:28, a personal
