Recognition For Sailing

For more than two years, David-
son's sailing team has competed as an
integral part of the college’s sports
scene. They meet all the criterla that
would guality a team for a varsity
sport. Yet, the Athletic Department
refuses to recognize the team as such.

Dr. Tom Scott. athletic director, has
based his abjections to recognition on
the grounds that the team does not
meet certain nebulous eligibility re-
quirements, and that the team does
not. compete on an intercollegiate lev-
el,

The question of eligibility, invelves
one of whose standards one yges. Sail-
ing is not recognized by th thern
Conference as an intercollegiatd sport;
consequently, the team cannot com-
pete on thal level. Instead. it belongs
to a separate orgonization, the South
Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Asso-
ciation. The campus sailors meet all
the eligibility requirements for com-
patition in that organization.

But though Dr. Scott has not yet
pointed to such a requirement. the
team has agreed to meet Southern
Conference standards if it will help
them gain recognition. They have
agreed to comply with distinction be-
tween the two groups: the Southern
Conference ban against allowing fresh-
mien to compete.

lt has also been claimed that the

sailors have no coach, another require-
ment of the Southern Conference. Gly-
en, no member of the Athletic Depart-
ment works with them, but they do
have a faculty sponser who works
with them at their weekly practices
and functions as a coach. There have
been other varsity sports under the
direction of faculty members, as mem-
bers of the ROTC Department now
coach the rifle team.

The objection based on a lack of in-
tercollegiate competition has absolute-
ly no basis The team competes with
all the members of the SAISA, includ-
ing Duke, College of Charleston, Uni-
versity of South Carolina. The Citadel,
William and Mary and Old Dominion.

Now going into its third year the
teain is well established. Approximatc-
ly $500 of the Athletic Depariment's
budget each year goes to the team to
defrav costs of competing in meets.
Such financing is itself a tacit admis-
sion of the role the satlors play in the
college's sports program.

Last spring, the D Club endorsed
the idea of allowing the team to be
alassified a varsity sport and be elt-
gible to receive varsity letters.

When members of the team have
demonstrated their stability and inter-
est—a genuine seriousness for their
apport—the least that can be done is
for them to be recognized as Jegiti-
mate. not a bastard sport.

Hollins Setting Pace

As Davidson gradually steps into the
area of vurriculuim reform, another
small Southern beral arts college is
preparing to implement a sweepin
curriculum change that could wel
serve at: a inspiration tn Davidson,

Holling College is instituting chang:
es that will put the emphasis of edu-
cation on individual initiative and re-
sponsibility, in allowing Nextbitity and
diversity, Hollins is demonstrating its
confidence that iis students possess
the maturity expecied of enllege stu-
dents af an above-average school

Required courses are being virtu-
ally abolished, with the only necessary
course s humanities prograin for fresh-
men over a 12week term. instead of
requiring specific courses, students
must choose a distribution from four
different disciplines: The humanities,
social sciences, natural sciences and
the arts.

The humanities program undertakes
no such vast ideal as attempting to ex-
plore the entire Western Civilization
—rather, the small (five to 13 mem-
bers) classes study a particular prob-
tem in history or some public issue.

A second drastic change is the three-
term structure, consisting of two 12-
week terms and one four-week term.
The short term, which falls between
the two longer ones. will be devoted
to some individual project, with no
regular academic work interfering.

There aren’t even any requirements
of what form the individual will take.
It may be poetry, a research paper,
involving library work or field trips

te de on-the-spot work.

The oft-mentioned pass-fail system
will remove any academic precsure
that might interfere with the work.
Students can undertake projects that
letier grade might otherwise discour-
age, Unfortunately, Hollins did not see
fit to extend the pass-fall system to
the regular academic work that stu-
dents undertake in the L2-week terms.

One particularly valuable aspect of
the new curriculum will be its de-
emphasis on departmental lines. The
independent project meed not be in
ihe student's major. Focusing on a
single problem forees students and
professors alike to examine the situa-
tion from a number of different view
points.

in undertaking the two-year curric-
ulum study, Hollins was guided by
the basic philosophy that students
should undertake as much individual
responsibility for their own education
as soon as possible. Hence the flexi-
bility in required courses, for fresh-
men as well as upperclassmen.

A number of similarities exist be
tween Hollins and Davidson: Both are
small] Southern liberal arts colleges,
with a generally recognized stature in
academic fields.

Though differences in situation may
Make specific application of Hollins’
innovations impractical here, most im-
portant is for the college to share the
verve, enthusiasm and daring necded
for significant, far-reaching improve-
nents to be made,

Atter much discussion then,
the Project of the Americns
was formed with the specific
task “lo crente a new Amer-
tean conscience.” During ils
two year existeney PRAM has
done amazing things: tens of
thousands of dollars haye becn
Taised in its sopport; imore
than 30 students have partial-
pated in PRAM's exchange
programs; PRAM chapters
continue to geow on Latin and
U. S. campuses.

THREE THINGS

What has made PRAM a suc-
cows? Pechaps three things;
PRAM continues to be student
conceived, organized, and ap-
ersied: PRAM insists on com-
plete non-affilation with any
government or other group:
PRAM helieves In the import.
apee of peraonal Wologue and
aplilon.

This last Is nn important fac-
tor. When Latin students ob-
‘aetve a debate over Santo Da-
mingo where some PRAM vol.
untcers suppart UW. S$. interven-
tion and uthers oppose it, they
realize the true nature af the
U. S. student. they pin in une
derstanding.

Such Js the underlying philos:
gphy of PRAM, viewed within
the context of the basic stu-
dent siluation. About six weeks
ago Fred Ehlers returned to
the U. 8., again under the au-
spices of the Richardzon Faun:
dation, in order to help rairy
funds for the organization be
founded.
