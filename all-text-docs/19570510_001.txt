PARKING

POLICIES:

Rules Need New Look

By JIM MORRIS
Davidsonian Feature Editor
Davidson “motorists” are about to observe the
second semester anniversary of “Big Time Campus

Parking.”

Many points of this year's
system have been good, and
credit should go to Mr, Grier
Martin and the Parking Com-
mittee, despite the fact that
their names have been withheld
by the College for fear of “stu-
dents’ presuring them.”

Yet, there is much that is
weak and unjust about the
system. Parking area has not
been increased and much con-
fusion has arisen concerning
the fine and enforcement sys-
tem.

274 TICKETS

Statistics released by the Bur-
sar’s office are as follows:

274 viloations for a 484 dol-

lar total.

11 refunds tor 21 dollars.

564 dollars for permits. ‘

While the system is good
(“The best of any I know,” said
Mr. Martin), the high violation
rate points up the fact that
there is still! something lack-
ing.

Much of this year's trouble
has been due to the confusion
caused by the College’s not
setting down the. details of
parking policy. This was espe-
cially true in the case of the
“10 day grace period” of pur-
chasing parking permits.

The progressive fine, where-
by every additive offense costs
more, even though the rule
violated might be different, and
the “nay the fine first, and then
see if the ticket was a mistake”
idea did little to encourage
student cooperation.

POSSIBLE REVISIONS

Here are some concrete sug-
gestions and observations that
might help the situation next
year.

1, Eliminate progressive

fines. The high number of

two or three time losers
as seen by the 1.75 dollar
avearge fine paid (First of-
fenders nay only one dollar)
would indicate that this

Frosh Prose Contest
Goes To Ed Spivey

The editorial board of Scripts
‘n Pranks announced the win-
ning entrant in the annual
Freshman Prose Contest late to-
day.

“Ed Spivey won the Contest

parency. He thus receives the
cash prize of ten dollars and an
appointment to the staff of
next year's Scripts 'n Pranks.

type of punishment does
not fulfill its only justifi-
cation, discouraging  re-
occurance of violations.
2, Revise the policy toward
appealing so that a viola-
tor is not “considered guil-
ty until proven innocent.”
3. Allow more time for the
payment of fines (One
week instead of the pres-
ent 24 hours). But a size-
able deduction (25%) coutd
be used to encourage rapid
payments (36 hours).
4. Simplify the method of
appealing and paying fines.
(The parking ticket could
be printed on a small en-
velope in which the fine
or appeal could be returned
by mail.)
5. Make parking regulations
and policies clearer both
to the student body and
those people responsible
for selling the permits and
collecting the fines.
6. Deal more harshly with
tardy fine payment. (Per-
haps if the fine is not paid
within 3 weeks, parking
privileges could be with-
held for one semester.)
With the fraternity court and
its traffic problems just over
the horizon the college should
continue to strive for a practical
and more equitable parking
plan. The present is good, but
the future must be better.

FIRST MEETING OF NEW REGIME

[Council Views
Drink, Theft

The initial meeting of

the 1957-58 Student Coun-

cil Monday night provoked discussion on questions per-
taining to drinking and stealing. A Court of Control was
elected for the 1957-58 year.

Phil Lewis was elected Judge
of the Court. Other senior mem-
bers selected were Charlie
Stowe, Dave Fagg, and Fritz
Russell. Juniors chosen were
Vernon Broyles and Craig Wall
with Sam Clarke and Pete Cole-
man as alternates.

Sophomore members will be
Larry McNeil and George Hart.
Milton Gee and Jim Owens are
the alternates.

John Kuykendall moved that
the Council accept the policy of
the past two years regarding
the drinking question. The “un-
der the influence” clause will
be interpreted to mean “visibly
affected in his actions.”

Retiring senior representative
Bunny Perkinson suggested
that the council take a definite
stand on the problem of steal-
ing. He stated that he feels
students might have lost faith
in the council’s ability to stop
theft.

The council has tried every
means of discovering the per-
son or persons involved, but
has not yet succeeded. Presi-
dent Smyth hopes that it will
not be necessary to call in a

patrol. He added that the best
solution is for each student to
lock his door.

Secrecy in the trials was the
subject of much _ discussion.
One member provoked this dis-
cussion by commenting that
many members of the student
body knew more about the trials
than he did.

Bill Bondurant, Dabney
Stuart, and John Kuykendall
were appointed to investigate
trial “leaks.” A decision was al-
so made which will initiate the
naming of the student con-
victed in a case along with the
nature of the offense.

Bob Livingston was chosen as
coordinator to the National Stu-
dent Association. John Bern-
hardt and Ralph Bright were
appointed to the Finance Com-
mittee; Bill Bondurant and Tom
Cutting to the Religious Exer-
cises Committee.

Bob Huffaker, junior repre-
sentative, was sworn in to the
council because of his absence
at chapel when the new coun-
cil accepted its duties. Senior
representative Bill Fraley was
absent from the council meet-

Sigma Nu Invited;
Trustees Get Plans

A recommendation to proceed with the building of
single unit fraternity houses for a new fraternity court
and to invite Sigma Nu Fraternity to establish a chapter
on the Davidson campus was passed’ Tuesday by the

faculty.

The fraternity court question nanced by a gift designated for

is now ready to be considered
by the Trustees, who will make
the decision.

The Faculty Fraternity Com-
mittee, Dean of Students, and
the Treasurer of the College
presented the following propos-
al to the faculty:

1. (a) That a new fraternity
court consisting of houses con-

taining social room, dining
room, unfinished basement
room, kitchen, and dietitian’s

apartment, costing approximate-
ly $30,000 each, be constructed
in the area north of the laundry,
to house 13 fraternities with
room to construct "additional
houses if needed in later years;

(b) That this court be fi-

Chapin Appoints
More Leaders

Lloyd Chapin, president of
the YMCA, has announced three
new appointments on the YMCA
cabinet.

John McVay has been ap-
pointed. to the worship post
formerly held by Duck. Coving- '
ton. He will be in charge of de-
votionals during exams, cabi-
net meetings, and special ser-
vices.

Bill Bondurant will be Stu-
dent Representative on the Re-
ligious Exercises committee,
and will suggest chanel and
vespers speakers as well as rep-
resent student opinion. This
position was formerly held by
Vernon Hunter.

Replacing Cari Cooper as
chairman of religious empha-
sis programs will be Willie
Thompson. Three such _ pro-
grams will be held next year,
with one main speaker at each.
These messages will deal with
various aspects of Christian
faith, such as, doctrine and so-
cial application.

Next Tuesday night at 6 p.m.
in the dining hall of the col-
lege church ‘the old and the
new YMCA cabinets and the
board of directors will meet
for an informal sandwich sup-

Annuals To Be
Issued May 20

According to Editor Ed
Young, the Quips and Cranks
should be ready for distribu-
tion on Monday, May. 20th.

Notices will be posted in the
Union and _ announcements
made in the fraternity houses
when the yearbooks arrive.

The annual staff is planning
a new method of distribution.
Under this new system, each
student will be responsible for
getting his annual, which will
be at the Union desk.

In order to keep the distribu-
tion orderly, a roster will be
posted and each student will
check his name when he ob-
tains his annual.

Young emphasized that it
will be entirely the respon-
sibility of the student to get
jhis own annual.

this purpose and the remainder
out of endowment funds as an
investment that will net the
College about five per cent re-
turn on the investment;

(ec) That a fraternity housing
fee be charged all fraternity
men and be collected with other
college fees, thus spreading the
cost of rental fees equally
among all fraternity members
so that small fraternity groups
will not be too hard-pressed;

(d) That a qualified lady, ap-
proved by the College, be em-
ployed by each fraternity to
serve as house mother and die-
titian for that. fraternity and
that living quarters be provid-
ed in each house for such a
person.

2. That, as a further measure
to relieve pressures on fraterni-
ties to become too large, an in-
vitation be extended to the Sig-
ma Nu fraternity to establish a
chapter at Davidson.

Fagg, Price Serve
On Athletic Council

In elections last week, Dave

‘Fagg and Bill Price were elected
to serve on the Athletic Coun-
jeil. The voting on Cheerleader

was begun, but the run-off was
not completed because of. a de:
cision to have the cheerleaders
elect their own Head Cheer-
leader.

These elections ended almost
two months of voting in which
thirty different offices were
filled.

Asked to comment on the
elections this year, Tom Mor-
gan, Chairman of the Elections
Board, suggested: ‘Elections
this year show that some method
must be devised whereby more
elections may be held simul-
taneously.

“Student interest in voting
just cannot be sustained over
a long period of run-offs and
individual elections for each of-
fice. |

“In many of the class elec-
tions voting fell to 40% and
under, despite the fact that
elections were held in Chapel
hich is supposed to be the
most convenient place.”

ACP Rates Paper
All-American

In nationwide competition the
DAVIDSONIAN recently re-
ecived the All-American Honor
Rating for its journalism dur.
ing the first semester of this -
year.

The Associated Collegiate
Press at. the University of:
Minnesota conferred their high-
est classification upon the cam-
pus newspaper after judging in.
the areas of coverage, content,
and physical properties.

Using a scale ranging from
poor to suverior, the Board con-
sistently placed the DAVID-
SONIAN in the very good, ex-
cellent, and superior categories.
They considered the coverage
“very professional” and the to-
tal makeup to be the “best
seen” in comparsion with other
newspapers of its class.

Superior characterized the
feature writing throughout the
paper as well as the editorial
section. Photography received
the highest plaudits as did the
creativeness and vitality of the
DAVIDSONIAN as a whole.

Criticisms ran from the over-
abundance of details and the
“stereotyped” quality sometimes
evidenced in the news content
to the need for more color in
sports writing.

The rating is a tribute to the
editorship and leadership of
Jim Batten and this year’s staff.
