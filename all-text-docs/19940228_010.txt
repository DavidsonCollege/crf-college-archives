Bavis's top
three CDs

By Tom Bavis
Last semester, Rachel New-
comb wrote about ten great al-
bums she would take with her to
Morocco, I was pleased that many
of her choices were obscure al-
bums by famous people. For ex-
ample, she put R.E.M. on the list
for their 1983 release Murmur, in-
stead of one of the better-selling
albums from the last five years.
When I take stock of my own CD’s,
I find that name recognition and
quality have no relationship. Asa
matter of fact, I often feel it is my
duty to crusade on behalf of a fa-
vorite if I feel it has not gotten the
credit it deserves. Here are some
underdog albums, by famous
people, for which I have preached
the word.
Billy Joel—Songs in theAttic.
This collection of live oldies was
released in 1981, ostensibly to ful-
fill a one album a year contract
between 1980's Glass Houses and
1982's The Nylon Curtain. Ironi-
cally, the songs on this album spew
more energy and genius than those
or any of his other releases. The
songs, taken from his highly cre-
ative and underrated early '70s pe-
riod, are clever pop nuggets that
could even stand beside his idols
the Beatles. Whereas the original
studio versions flop along with by-
the-numbers playing, theSongs in
the Attic versions burn themselves
into the disc. For both “Say
Goodbye to Hollywood” and
“She’s Got a Way,” the Songs in
the Attic versions were so much
better than the originals that they
were chosen to represent the songs
on Billy’s greatest hits album. “The
Ballad of Billy the Kid” rises to the
highest level of musicianship, even
without the string section of the
original. For very good reasons,
Songs in the Attic was the first
Billy Joel album I bought on CD.
Joni Mitchell—The Hissing of
Summer Lawns. Joni Mitchell, a
singer who like Billy Joel peaked
in the ‘70s, has made an unfathom-
able number of strong albums.
Many of them gained due recogni-
tion when they were new. The
Hissing of Summer Lawns, though,
has traditionally been thrown the
cold shoulder by fickle fans. Asa
follow-up to her enormously suc-
cessful Court and Spark, The Hiss-
ing of Summer Lawns, like its title,
is more complex and lyrically con-
fusing. In retrospect, that is why
the album is so superlative. It
floats along jazz-laced through-
out—in a ‘90s comparison, it
sounds like a mix of Sting and the
Indigo Girls. Acoustic guitars, pi-
anos, and slide guitars paint a rich,
dreamy musical landscape as Joni
sings about who-knows-what over
the top with extended, intricate
melodies. Some of the more sen-

suous lyrics (for example, “Every.

picture has its shadow/And it has
some source of light/Blindness and

What's Missing’?
Why some bands don't play in Charlotte

By Josh Larned

Charlotte. A blossoming
metropolis. A symphony, art
museums, sports teams. Col-
leges and universities abound. A
cultural focal point in the
Carolina region for young
America. Given all of these
characteristics, it would seem
that Charlotte would be a. mecca
for musicians.

Not exactly. Ok, so Rush
played here on Friday night and
we always get our share of Judy
Collinses and Garth Brookses.
However, it’s not the mega-acts
that the Queen city terribly lacks.
Rather, it's the performers of
today (call it alternative, college
music, whatever) that seem to

take a detour for other cities. _
Personally, I can identify

with such musicians much more
than I can with Luther Vandross
or Randy Travis (no offense to
my Whistlin’ Dixie colleague).
In my opinion, Nirvana, Smash-
ing Pumpkins, Tribe called
Quest, and Big Head Todd and

.the Monsters more aceurately

reflect our generation’s defini-
tion of music. However, such
acts come around only once ina
blue moon and when they do it
seems a long time before they are
ever willing to come back.

Why? Charlotte certainly has a
large enough audience for such
music. You'd think this city
would be more accessible than a

Livingston:
characters in movies

By Matt Smith

The Davidson College Union
hosted world-renowned
intentionalist Dr. Paisley
Livingston on Monday, February
21.

Livingston’s lecture, entitled
“Characterization in Film,” con-
sisted mainly of reading the latest
draft of a lengthy paper he is pre-
paring for publication. In addi-
tion, he would occasionally pause
to comment on or clarify a com-
ment he made or an idea he was
exploring.

Dr. Livingston’s approach to
literature and film is widely known
as “intentionalism.” Those critics
and scholars who subscribe to this
approach believe that it is possible
to discern an artist’s intentions and
motivations behind his or her work.

This idea strongly conflicts with

the presently more popular notion
that it is impossible to truly know
what an artist intended in creating
his or her work.

A scholar in. his field, Dr.
Livingston’s gave his lecture at a

_ level which might have left those

less familiar with film and film
theory somewhat confused. How-
ever, he remained after the lecture
to answer any questions the audi-
ence had.

Dr. Livingston has studied at
several Ivy League universities as
well as the University of Paris. He
is currently a professor of litera-

Winston-Salem, a Raleigh-
Durham, or an Athens, Georgia.
Something ha’ gone terribly
wrong and many avid listeners,
including myself, are frustrated.
Foremost, the problem
seems to boil down to the lack of
publicity for such music. When
groups do come, it seems that not
enough people actually know
about when and where the
performances will actually take
place. Take Widespread Panic,

_for example. This group appears

to be pretty popular on
Davidson’s campus. However, it
seems that few students knew
that they were performing at the
Ritz last Thursday night. I know
of one fellow student who was
giving tickets away because of a
heavy work load and had a
difficult time doing so because
that others weren’t aware of the
show themselves and hadn’t
oriented their schedules to go see
it. I’m not sure of the attendance
at Thursday’s show, but it is
simple capitalism that if nobody
knows about a show, tickets
won’t sell, and the performer(s)
will be much more reluctant to
return in the future.

In a worse scenario, people
often do not hear enough of a
group’s songs to feel inclined to
see them in concert. One can
always consult a Creative
Loafing or even our own
Davidsonian for publicity and
information. However, without a
doubt, the most important
medium for musicians is the
radio.

Although many alternative
acts do receive air time in the
Charlotte area, such listening
time is highly limited.
Charlotte’s big stations (such as
the Fox) opt to blast Bachman-
Turner Overdrive instead of the
Lemonheads because of the
dangerous risk of losing their
hillbilly audience. This isn’t
necessarily a bad thing--I’m sure
that there are a lot of BTO fans
out there in “Metrolina” (I’m

s that something is still missing--

glad I don’t know any of them),
but there are lots of radio
listeners who feel starved for
fresher types of music.

Senior Ryan Smith, who was
briefly involved with the
Alternative Radio Coalition
(ARC) in an effort to bring an
alternative station to Charlotte,
feels that the lack of such an
outlet is highly detrimental to the
area music’scene. “There are
plenty of good bands out there,
but there’s no way that they’re
going to get heard without a
radio station,” Smith explains.
“When kids hear what they like,
they want to go to shows and
form their own bands and it all
contributes to the music scene.
However, without a good radio
station, the Charlotte scene is
pretty much non-existent.”
Smith feels that factionalism
within ARC has slowed down
the process of bringing a new
radio station to the area.

Michael Ford, manager for
Hometown Records in Cornelius,
feels that Charlotte’s deprived
music scene is the result of .
inadequate venues. “The one
thing that Charlotte lacks is a
venue between 1,000 and 3,000
people that can bring in alterna-
tive bands,” Ford says. “We
don’t have a venue of that size.
Ovens Auditorium is the only
venue that fits that description.
Many good bands, such as
Fishbone in their recent show, do
come through Charlotte, but
other groups would rather go to
Chapel Hill and elsewhere. Such
a venue would probably benefit
Charlotte the most.”

Whether a radio station or
better clubs would be Charlotte’s
solution remains to be seen.
Nevertheless, until something is
done, the area will remain a
wasteland for what is quickly
becoming the nation’s most
popular music. In the meantime,
I'll keep taking road-trips to
Chapel Hill to see my favorite
groups.
