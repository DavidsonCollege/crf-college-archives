Schenck Gives
Talk On Faith

Continues Series of Discourses
Concerning Christian
Wisdom

Continuing his lesson on Christ-

ian Wisdom, from the book of
James, Dr. L. B. Schenck taught
the Sunday school lesson in Phi

Hall. The topic of the lesson was
“The True Christian Faith;’ the
result of life full
and abundant; life with confidence

and assurance,

Dr. Schenck illustrated his point
on Chrstian faith by the views of
great men: Paul showing Christian
law and liberty with the method
of Salvation; John showing love by
faith, and James showingsthe fun-

damental note of truth as applied
to life. The book of James is a
practical epistle; proving liberty

and reality in religion.
