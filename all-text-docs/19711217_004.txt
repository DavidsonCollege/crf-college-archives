In Search Of A Chaplain

The resignation of Scott Woodmansee as college chap-
lain brings into the open some very sticky questions con-
cerning the role of the chaplain at Davidson. _

There have been many who from time to time howled
for the chaplain’s blood, not because of his ineptitude or
personality, but because of the seeming irrelevance and
uselessness of his post.

With the new-look Dean of Students office and the
apparently successful counseling services, plus the work
being done concering programs and speakers by Union
officials, one is left to wonder just what the need for a
chaplain is. Indeed, with the new individualist emphasis
in religion, the last functions of a chaplain are stripped
away.

‘The issue runs deeper than this, however. For one
thing, the college YMCA, which still serves as the students’
most effective and worthwhile work in the Davidson com-
munity, is directed and supported by the chaplain. Others
perhaps could do the same job, but the amount of time
and energy involved make such a possibility grim.

Another consideration is that Davidson, like it or not,
is still affiliated with the Presbyterian Church, and for
all practical purposes is controlled by the block vote of
Presbyterian ministers who make up a good third of the
Board of Trustees. These men, and the majority of the
college administrators and many of the faculty, feel a
definite need here for some sort of a campus ministery,
and they will not be swayed from this belief.

Thus, it seems logical to us that the college hire
another chaplain, but do so by creating a new position
with different functions and roles than the traditional
chaplaincy.

Davidson no longer needs the chaplain to handle pro-
graming or counseling or religious and spiritual develop-
ment. Such duties can still be aided by the new chaplain,
buf such should not be his major concern.

Rather, the new chaplain, as Woodmansee himself
has suggested, could serve both the church and the col-
lege community by holding the position of associate minist-
er at the church and chaplain here. The college would
therefore be paying him less, he would have ties with
both the students and the community, and neither stu-
dents or chaplain would fill the obnoxious obligation of
having to entertain one another.

If we have to have a chaplain, then let’s at least be
realistic.

A More Perfect Union

We would like to thank President Spencer for his
Statement concerr.ng the future of -the college union. It
is encouraging to note that the chief administrator of the
college is concerned with the future of the social life of
the school as well as the academic.

While we find it encouraging that the president has
made the commitment that he has, we would like to see
that commitment take a more definite form.

The status of the union in President Spencer’s state-
ment places the new union building in the same class
with the other general promises of the past.

The library which was expected to be in use this
year, coeducation, and the Honors College, in operation
for the last two years after a three year span of inactivity,
have all had the same sort of ringing endorsement from
administration officials.

It is nice that the president is willing to speak out in
favor of a new union building. It would be difficult to
imagine .a unionless campus, with no social center.

But we would ask that the president, in consultation
with his vice-presidents, students, the various building and
grounds committees, etc., set a definite date for the be-
ginning of construction on the new structure to be initiated
immediately.

The union building will still be a long way from con-
struction even when the date is set, and we don’t believe
that the campus can afford to do without for long.

Acknowledgments

Congratulations to Danny Clodfelter and Lawrence
Wilkinson on their success in the Rhodes Scholarship com-
petition. It is quite remarkable that Davidson should be
honored by- having both representatives for the state.

Appreciation to Scott Woodmansee for his years of
service to Davidson College. His contribution to Davidson
has been a welcome, if thankless, one. We wish him suc-
cess with his new congregation.

Hall Counselors Point Out
Freshmen Leaving Davidson

Loud rock music poured into
my bedroom. It was another
typical Saturday night on the
fraternity court. 1 looked at my
clock which informed me _ it
was two a.m. It seemed appro-
priate to assume all were hav-
ing a good time. I was far from
the truth.

At the beginning of the week
I stumbled across the present
movement by the hall coun-
selors to petition the president
of the college. The petition ex-
pressed ‘their concern at the
alarming number of freshman
who had already left Davidson
with no intention of returning.

They were also concerned
about the number of freshman
who were initiating transfer
processes. This freshman class
is not like my class, all talk
and very little action. They ap-
parently do not wish to contend
with the non-reality of the Dav-
idson experiecne.

Perhaps this is good: perhaps
it is bad. It may be that this
freshman class does not have
the frustration tolerance of the
classes of past years. Maybe
they just have more sense than
the rest of us.

Somehow we have all failed
this freshman class. We all
share the burden of placing
these freshman in a_ sterile
community. My class has been
here for four years and we
have not yet influenced the
people or produced the argu-
ments to bring about coeduca-
tion.

The hail counselors, the mem-
bers of this community closest
to the freshman, feel the under-
lying reason for the discontent
in the class is coeducation. Al-
though this may not encompass
totality of the reasoning, |
feel that | must agree with the
hall counselors.

The many arguments for co-
2ducation have been presented
numerous times. I shall not go
into them. However, it does
seem that if Davidson goes
coed, it will go for the wrong
reasons.

The administration's decisions
will be based on considerations
such as being able to obtain
coeds who will not lower the
academic standards and be-
cause these coeds will be able
to ‘‘pay their way.” The ad-
ministration is confident it can
find coeds who meet both of
these criteria, |

The administration places
concern for student welfare and
student needs low in its list of
priorities. They wish to build
a coeducational community out
of totally financial considera-
tions. They appear unconcern-
ed with the human aspect of
college education.

The community owes a debt
of thanks to the hall counselors
for their human concern for the
freshman at Davidson. Their
concern for the mental well-
being of the freshman, and per-
haps for the mental well-being
of us alt, should be greatly ap.

preciated.

Even more than appreciated,
their concerns should be our
concerns and they should in-
spire us to action. We should

bring down the sterile walls of
monasticism and bring our com.
munity, possibly for the first
time, into the light of reality.

Christmas brings
Goodwill Guns?

Peace on earth, goodwill to
men. Yes, its that time again.
Time again to hear ‘‘peace and
goodwill” preached about, sung
about, read in Hallmark cards,
seen in Belk’s window, painted
on giftwrap — but not realized.

I was in Charlotte this past
weekend and was brave enough
to venture out to one of the
larger shopping centers to take
some dry cleaning in. 1 passed

a toy store — one of those
shops hastily housed in a va-
cant slot in the center — and

decided to drop in.

It was the first time I had
been in a real toy store (as op-
posed to a department store
which sells toys) in a few years
and I wanted to see what Santa
would be bringing this year.

There it was, just as I walked
in. Shiny grey and imitation
wood. ‘The U.S. Fighting Man's
Best Friend — THE M-1."' Com-
plete with plastic shells to shoot
your best friend with. The same
as when I was 8 or 9. It hasn't
changed.

So on Christmas

LETTER

morning,

thousands of boys will run out-
side at 6 a.m. to play war or
cowboys and Indians, or what-
ever name kids give it now. And
they'll come back inside later
to watch cartoon Tom and Jer-
ries die a thousand deaths and
live again, and a thousand tv
badguys get hit with a 44 slug
from 10 feet and slump slowly
to the floor. No blood, no pieces
of flesh flying across the room,
just a slow slump, and a ‘‘darn
you, Matt Dillon.”

But what about the kids who
play Indians and Pakistanis, or
Irish and British, or Israeli and
Arabs — not with Mattel guns
but with real ones. I wonder if
they would like an M-1 for
Christmas?

If you've got a little brother
or a cousin and want to give
him a good present this year.
give him an hour or two of your
time. And if you really want to
see his eyes light up, give him
a refrigerator crate. If we can’t
have peace on Earth this year,
let's try building a little around
ourselves,

Australian Praises Allen
For ‘Common’ Language

To The Editor:

I am in receipt of a cutting
entitled ‘‘Offensive Colloquial
Language Forms Student Vern-
acular” and would like to con-
gratulate you on your courage
in making known something
that has been normal language
among the, ahem, ‘‘common
herd” for ages past.

Allow me to make plain some
dark words in our language.
You make known ‘“‘two tits and
an ass.” In this country the
word ‘‘ass” is spelled ‘‘arse”
but means the same thing. What
are words but the expression of
what one thinks? Is it not also
better to speak aloud what one
may think in private?

Even if we examine the Good
Book we will see words like
“piss.” Is this word verboten in
everyday language? Hardly. In
Australia, if two men say ‘‘Let’s
get on the piss’ this doesn’t
mean that they are going to
drink each other's urine. It
simply means that they are go-
ing to get on the grog. A nor-
mal colloquial expression.

If we go hack to the time of
Henry VIII we find such ex-
pressions as ‘‘buggery.” The
act of ‘“‘buggerising about”

would result in one or both los-
ing one’s head — for the act
of buggery was the act of homo-
sexuality. ,

“Shit” in Australia at any
rate, is not all that horrid.

Of course one, depending on
whom one is, that is, is horrified
by seeing such words as “shit”
and “fuck” in’ print in newspa-
pers but is this any the less
obscene in being used openly.

For the few Bobby Allen's
there are millions who say the
Same words behind closed doors
—and smirk when they say those
words—so that the Bobby Al-
len’s, the Clemson newspaper
editor, the Mary Washington
college editor and others should
be praised and laughed at in-
Stead of being condemned. _

Such words may appall and
disgust the majority but so does
the word ‘peace’, therefore, go
to it, mates, bring the world out
into the open and let it blink
in the daylight for those who
would muzzle you are those
who would be classified as
“darkness endeavouring tg il-
lumniate light.”
