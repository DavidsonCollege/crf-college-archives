Gull's Nest

Summer: The time of pennant races and quasi-expensive beer

By Bill Gullan

The summer is a time of pen-
nant races, familiar faces, exotic
places, and empty cases. It’s the
season of uncompromising love
and compromising positions. It’s
when dreams are realized or when
boredom sets in. It’s a time to
splurge and a time to save. It goes
too fast or too slow; never just
right. The girls look great, the beer
tastes good, and academia is, oh,
so far away.

Ihave no A/Cat home. Ihave
a fan in my room, so I tended to lie
in my bed like a beached whale.
That’s something one can doin the
summertime, and I sure didit. The
heat wave of ’93 hit Philly like a
ton of scalding hot bricks, and the

city moaned from under floppy
hats and RayBan sunglasses.
Atlunch downtown, the skirts
got shorter, the shirtsleeves were
rolled up, and the drivers were
frustrated. People wasted time,
waiting for that first cold beer or
the pregame show. Speaking of
wasting time, my job was just that.
I filed, typed, proofread, and stuffed
envelopes at the University of
Pennsylvania. However, I earned
beer money, smoke money, waste-
on-annoying-girlfriend money, and
savings account money. And my
resume will say, “fundraising.”
Summer is also the time for
quasi-expensive beer. Once the
GPA shock wore off, I could al-
ways count on going home with

mom to the distributor for our
family’s needs. I was always able
to convince her that, “Yes, mom,
Sam Adams and Moosehead are
cheap beers.” Also, Beast ain’t
sold in bars. Neither are Piels or
Busch.

Summer is also a fine time to
road trip. Whether it be the Jersey
shore, Baltimore, New York, or
Ocean City, my supercharged Es-
cort frequently escorted a small
yet boisterous group of drunkards
around the East coast. I did spend
a week in D.C. at a convention
with a bunch of young fascists like
myself, and was excited to find
that there are other young Repub-
licans who can dispense with their
policy debates long enough tosuck

down a few. By the way, checkout
Kelly’s Irish Times on Capitol Hill.
Great bar. To quote Robert Louis
Stevenson, “In summer quite the
other way, I have to go to bed by
day!”

Summer was not just a string
of alcoholic mornings, afternoons,
and evenings, though. Between
my job at Penn and the help I gave
my father at his warehouse, I
worked a lot. I also read actual
books and got back in touch with
current events.

I also had a girlfriend for a
while. The whole thing petered
outin early August, but when funds
runlow, nothingis better than snug-
gling up with a nice girl in front of
the tube (if you can gether to watch

baseball).

That last point brings me to
the real highlight of my summer:
the world champion Phillies (oh, I
guess they haven’t officially won
it yet).

All cockiness aside, they are
an exciting team to watch, and that
they are able to win with half the
team possessing worse physiques
than my ownisa miracle. October
will be fun for me, win or lose. It
sure beats last place (sorry Mets
fans, your team belongs in the mi-
nors).

Alas, summer has left us, or
we it. Either way, it sure was fun
while it lasted. As the sad old song
goes, “We’ll have these moments
forever, but never again.”

Biologies, cancer, back
rooms, and your education

Editors' note: The following is an
excerpt from a speech given by
Duke University President,
Nannerl Keohane, when she wel-
comed the class of 1997. This is
reprinted from the Charlotte Ob-
server,

Be intellectually bold and ad-
venturous. If you stick entirely to
subjects you already know some-
thing about and feel like you will

dowellin, you’ ll miss the opportu. -

nity to discover whole new ways
of looking at the world. You will
be like an explorer who chickens
out just before the big voyage and
decides, instead of traveling up the
Amazon or trying to get to Mars, to
play it safe and visit the town next
door instead.

The biggest cancer of an un-
dergraduate education is worrying
too early and too much about what
you’re going to do afterward. That
kind of worry consumes your time
and energies, redirects your vital
juices in perverse directions, and
slowly drives out more healthy in-
tellectual impulses.

ese &

To make you a more interest-
ing person to spend time with, both
for yourself and others, ought tobe
one of the primary purposes of
your education.

One of my favorite authors is
Michel de Montaigne, who wrote a
book for which he coined a new
title that has become a common
noun: essais. The French root of
this word means to try, to experi-
ment, to give things a chance and
see what happens.

Montaigne hit upon a lovely
image that commend to you: the
image of the “back room of the
mind.” He thought of his own

mind as a kind of tower library to
which he could retreat, filled with
quotations from wise people and
experimental thoughts and jokes
and anecdotes, where he could keep
company with himself. He sug-
gested that we all have such back
rooms in our minds, and that the
most valuable and attractive people
we know tend to be people who
have rich and fascinating furniture
in those spaces rather than a void
between their ears.

You might think of your edu-
cation as a way of furnishing the
back room of your mind.

*** *

If you succumb to the tempta-
tion to spend all your time at Duke
with people who dress and think
and talk just like you do, you will
be cheating yourself of one of the
most significant parts of a good
education. They willreinforce your
notion that the world really is just
exactly the way you think itis; but
that’s a dangerous conceit.

One of the advantages of a
great university is that there are
many different kinds of people,
with many ways of looking at the
world. You should take advantage
of that to find out what the world
looks like to them, in order to
broaden and refine your. own
knowledge of the world.

It’s easy to assume that hav-
ing different kinds of folks around
is just a feature of the place that
you are expected to tolerate, care-
fully avoiding being mean or preju-
diced. But diversity on a univer-
sity campus involves much more
than that. It is one of the essential
sources of your education; you
should value diversity and learn
from it.

The opinions section is looking for
writers who do not have witty
opinions about campus life. If you
have any sincere insights please

Brother, can you spare a dime?

You seniors know of what I
speak. Last Tuesday night's Ca-
reers meeting beheld a spectacle

which revealed tothe class of 1994 ~

what their future looked like. It is
nota pretty picture. I realized what
Ihad to offer the world, and with it
came a clearer picture of what
Napoleon must have felt like after
Waterloo; what Lee was feeling at
Appomattox; what Nixon felt like
after Watergate; or what was go-

_ ing through Pee Wee Herman’s

mind at Charlie’s Pleasure Palace
(after the cop walked in, I mean).

paralyzed for hours at a time in
grocery store aisles, trying to fig-
ure out if the 64 ounce bottle of
Olde English 800 is a better deal
than two of the 32 ounce ones.
Everything that I could put
down in a resume would be a
stretch. I never got any credit
when I went out and rubbed pop-
cornin my hair. Howam I going to
explainto IBM that the experience
taught me anything? I was the
instigator of the thing (soI’m told);

does that make me a leader? Last -

weekend I was doing cartwheels in
the middle of Patterson Court. Does
that make me creative?

_ Thavedonenothingall through
my college career, and now I have
to find a way to make it in the real
world. The way I see it, Ihave two

options: 1) I could sleep with
someone really important or 2) a
long lost eccentric millionaire rela-
tive of mine could die and leave me
all of his money. The odds of a
millionaire leaving his money to
me are much better than me sleep-
ing with anyone, let alone some-
one important. The real world is
approaching me about as fast as a
windshield closing in on a bug. I
can’t even look forward to Beavis
and Butt-Head. MTV has shown
the exact same episode for the past
three nights.

Immediately following the
senior meeting entitled “We Have
Your Eighty Thousand Dollars and
There’s Nothing You Can Do
About It” Iranintothe one comfort
Ihave. If anything has helped me
get through college, itis Geoffrey
Chaucer’s Troilus and Creseyde.

Ofcourse I’m kidding. (Sorry,
Dr. Gibson) I did what any self-
respecting 21 year-old would do. I
ran ‘straight to the grocery store,
boughta case of beer, and drowned
my sorrows witha bunch of equally
miserable seniors.

The moral of the story: run to
your richest relative and start
brown-nosing fast.
