As most of you know, Jim
Melton, a sophomore at Dav-
idson, was seriously injured
in an automobile acsident
during the Homecoming
weekend. Jim was in Me-
morial Hospital for several
weeks with both jaws broken.

Due to the expense of hos-
pitalization and several opera-
tions, Jim has a very great
need for financial help. We,
his fraternity brothers in Phi
Gamma Delta, are in the pro-
cess of contributing to help
pay some of this expense, but
our help can cover only a
fraction of the need which
must be met. _

Sometime during the next
few days one of us will visit
you about contributing to
help Jim with his expenses.
We would like to set a cam-
pus goal of $1,000, but we
went to leave it up to each
student as to how much he
can contribute.

As a further method of
help, next Sunday's Vespers
offering is pledged to help
Jim, and we hope to have a
door-to-door canvas in town
in the next few days. We
hope that you will want to
help us.
