nated as the time when the North Caro-
lina Collegiate Press Association will

ment yesterday by Aubrey Brown, in
charge of arrangements here.

The press body was invited here last
spring when Duke was host to the young
people representing newspapers, annuals
and magazines of the different colleges of
this state and the acceptance was unani-
mous.

A delightful program is being arranged
for the instruction and entertainment of
the press devotees when they come here
next month. On Thursday afternoon
there will be the registration and a re-
ception. That night a banquet is planned
at the Maxwell-Chambers Hotel. The

Directly after noon a motorcade of some
twenty cars will come from Charlotte to
transport the entire group to Queens Col-

ception. That night will find the en-
tertainment taking place at Hotel Char-
lotte, where the Observer Printing Com-

Davidson before 12 o'clock that night.

ASSISTANT CHEER
LEADERS ELECTED

Robertson and Heefner Chosen to
Assist Myers

In the final tabulation of votes for as-

sistant cheer leaders, E. S. Heefner and

Roberson were chosen to be the two who,

will assist Nelson Myers with the cheer
leading. Heefner was elected on the first
ballot held last Tuesday morning in
chapel, and Roberson was elected Wednes-
day morning on the second ballot, in the
runoff between Roberson and Coker. The
final vote was Roberson 148, Coker 116.

There were only six men put before the
student body for consideration. Last
spring around 10 men of the Sophomore
class were out at the baseball games as-
sisting Nelson Myers. This year some
did not return to school and some men
quit, leaving only six Juniors in the run-
ning, Heefner, Roberson, Coker, Croom,
DuBose,and Edleman. In the election

ed two men, Heefner being elected on

ner 169, Roberson 112, Coker 112, Croom
55, DuBose 25, Edleman 48. On the run-
off ballot the final result was Roberson

It was an

a on
all-Davidson meeting in which the presi-
dent and secretary of the D. C. “Y” led
the services. Professor Williams closed
the exercises with a prayer.

At the beginning of his talk Melton
gave a short word of welcome on behalf
of the Y. M. C, A. to both the new and
old students. He urged every boy on the
roll to use the “Y’’ and co-operate with
the cabinet in its work.

“Jesus Christ is what I am bringing to
you tonight,” stated Melton. “He then
explained his text from Hebrews, the
tenth chapter and nineteenth verse, ‘““Hav-
ing therefore brethren, boldness to enter
into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.”
Each person gave a blood sacrifice of
some animal to atone for their sins before
the crucifixion of Christ. After giving
His ‘blood for us there were no more
sacrifices because He had made the su-
preme sacrifice.

It is necessary to draw near to Christ
with a true heart and full assurance ‘of
faith after He has made such a sacrifice.
It is hard to do so, but is also a great
privilege to come to Him. After one has
come to Christ one must hold fast and
not slip away from Him as it is so easy
to do. The Apostle Paul is a good ex-
ample of one who has held fast through
everything. “It takes a man to do it,”
said Melton.

Consider one another in everything.
Try to do as Christ did—He never forgot
His disciples even to the last minute, in
spite of all His conflicts.

Speak and show your religion to others.
There are millions of orpportunities on this
campus to speak of Jesus Christ. You are
showing your religion by coming to meet-
ings like these.

Realize that your life here will be as
it is in the future. One’s conduct today
makes one’s life for him tomorrow. “Let
