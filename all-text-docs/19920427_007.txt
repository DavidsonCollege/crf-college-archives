Rebuilding Community

Wednesday evening, the Student Government Association sponsored a
forum that addressed the recent changes in the college’s alcohol policy and
the findings of the Select Committee’s report on “Rebuiding Community”.
One of the speakers was SGA president Anthony Foxx who stressed the need
for the campus to move forward and confront the community’s problems
rather than criticize legislation by the administration. “We must come to
grips with what made it necessary for Davidson to propose a new alcohol
policy, and what made it necessary for the Select Committee to issue its
report,” Foxx said. :

Foxx is right on target on the necessity of the community to move ahead
and begin tackling the problems that have faced us over the pastfew months.
Steps by Dean of Faculty Robert Williams to continue the formation of the
Ethnic Studies Department at this time is an example of positive efforts by
the administration. Williams hopes that the presence of such a program will
address many of the issues causing social tension on the campus in an aca-
demic setting. So do we. In addition, plans by the Dean of Students office
to include more cultural understanding activities as part of Freshman orien-

- tation will also contribute to a healthier environment.

Despite these positive steps and the awareness of a need to “rebuild” our
community, there remains a “pall” over the campus from the residue of the
Select Committee’s report. The organizations and individuals (such as
Patterson Court, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and the Dean of Students Office)
targetted in the report remain subject to many of the report’s inaccuracies
and attacks. The Davidsonian agrees that itis time to accentuate the positive
and move on. We commend the efforts of the Dean of Faculty and the Dean
of Student’s Office, but it is a shame that some members of the community
are still feeling the report’s negative affects.

Congratulations Seniors

Well, your life will no longer include blue books, self scheduled exams
or Patterson Court (well, neither will ours) and it is time to move on into the
real world. Congratulations, good luck and we hope you eventually find
jobs.

Professor Mills Supports
Work of Select Committee

To the Editor,

I write to share two bits
of information with you: 1)
Davidson does have a docu-
ment such as the one you
praise from UNC in your
editorial (“Committee Did
Poor Job,” March 23, 1992),
and 2) that report says many
of the same things you sug-
gest may be singular obser-
vations of the Select Com-
mittee on Alleged Intoler-
ance.

The Task Force on the
Quality of Student Life--a
committee of students, fac-
ulty, staff, and trustees--
gathered, analyzed, and
interpreted information from
September 4, 1989 until we

presented our report to Presi-
dent Kuykendall on March
30, 1990.

I urge you to read the
138-page report. Certainly,
a Davidsonian reporter, or
anyoncelse interested in how
the college is progressing in
the challenge to create a
responsiblecommunity,can
review those recommenda-
tions and compare them with
changes that have taken
place and with charges that
emerge in the report of the
Select Committee.

The voices of as many
students and parents and fac-
ulty and staff who were will-
ing to respond appear in the
Task Force report. Some of

them make claims that your
editorial implies are unique
to the “less than 2% of the
student body” the Sclect
Committee interviewed. In
the report of the Committee

‘on Patterson Court and Resi-

dence, Life, which inter-
viewed “constituencies from
each Patterson Court house
and from each dorm, as well
as representatives from off-
campus, in open discus-
sions,” for instance, these
words appear:

Formen, the stronger identi-
fication with a fraternity led
to students “blocking” to-

Figho Urges Student Consideration

To the Editor,
Last Monday night, I put up
about one hundred flyers
‘around campus specifically
‘ announcing a postoffice box
that F.L.A.G. has acquired.
The main purpose of 2968 is
toserve for an outlet for gay,
lesbian, and bisexual stu-

want to be introduced to
other students or just to
someone understanding to
talk to in the strictest confi-
dence. Within a few hours,

| more than half of the flyers

had been taken down, either
crumbled or thrown to the

dents on campus who might

bottom of stairwells, or
conscientiously placed in
campus recycling bins.

To those considerate
men and/or women whotook
those flyers down, I thank
you. It saves me the trouble
of having to take them down

myself. Unfortunately, you —

did miss afew. I’d mention
where they are, but I don’t
want to lessen my own bur-
den ofremoving them--when
the time is right.

It’s times like these that
make me happy to. be at
Davidson. I love breathing
that straight, Souther, privi-

leged, whiteair. Sometimes,
Ibreathe itindeeply, ithurts.
It makes me come to my
senses in times like these
when I have wandered away
from the herd. How dare I
think that we could accept
something different. Sllly
me! They’re just a bunch of
faggots, aren’tthey. Imean,
who really believes that
“biologically inclined” stuff
anyway? Thcy’re perverts,
all of them. What rights
could they possibly deserve?

Recently, it has. becn

_ Lane Urges Return of Humor

To the Editor,

ing, then he either has no
sense of humor or no sense
of proportion.”

Iam unsure of thesource
of this quote, but it illus-
trates an important point. In
th year or two, itseems
that everyone has taken upa
cause to champion. While
there is no harm in this--in
fact, dissatisfaction with

current conditions is a pow-

erful impetus for change--it

| also seems that too: many

unfortunate trap of taking
themselves far too seriously.

Many may counter this
with the assertion that they
like to party with friends on
the weekends, but thatis not
what I mean. I had the op-
portunity recently to peruse
the spring 1951 issue of
Scripts and Pranks. 1 found
it an amusing and delightful

publication. In- speaking
with an alumnus of that era,
I was told that it was regu-
larly filled with humorous
stories, anecdotes, and draw-
ings, as wells as creative
writing, although occasion-
ally controversial and-usu-
ally satirical, most submis-
sions were written in good
taste. (If anyone is inter-

ested in reading Scripts and
Pranks for himself, they are
located in the Davidsonia
Room of E.H. Little Library.)

1965 was the last year
Scripts and Pranks was
published in its original
form, a (usually) monthly
magazine. It has since been
retired to the inside back
cover of. the quarterly
Davidson Journal, and,
contains little humor. A
revival of this little bit of
Davidsonia, I think, would
do wonders towards helping’
us laugh together, instead of
constantly promoting our
views and opinions on this
