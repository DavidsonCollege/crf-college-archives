Story of Rape Unconfirmed

Ass’t. Dean of Students Writes Letter to End Rumors

By Alice Felmlee

For the past few weeks stories
of an attempted rape on campus
have been the talk of students and
faculty. These discussions have
occured just as the school began to
honor student requests for more
campus lighting. Thisrape, thought
to have occured either between the
Chambers Building and Sentelle
Residence Hall or behind Little
Library, is now believed to be an
unfounded rumor.

After lengthy discussions with
campus police, grounds person-
nel, community members, and stu-

however,] there is still great

assault. In a letter addressed to the
Davidson communtiy Assistant
Dean of Students, Dr. Leslie
Marsicano, stated, “As of now we
have no specific information as to

day, time, location, victim, or pos-
sible witnesses.” She urges, how-
ever, that there is still great con-
cern over the rumors and that the

case is not considered closed.

Any victims of a recent as-
sault.or individuals with informa-
tion regarding this case are asked
to speak with someone in the Dean
of Student’s Office. In no way will
they be forced to press charges;
yet immediate medical care, emo-
tional support, and academic relief
are available.

"Women at Davidson are sub-
jecttoadouble bind. Noone wants
to violate confidentiality on these
issues but we need to know when
these things happen so more
women can protect themselves,"
saidsenior Adriana Tavernise who
is an active member of Women's
Issues committees.

!All members of the Davidson
family are reminded to take pre-
cautions in protecting themselves
and their property. While the cam-
pus is safe compared to larger,
more metropolitan universities, it
is not foreign to crime. Locking
cars and bedroom doors, calling
the escort service, walking with
friends and remaining in well-lit
areas may protect you in the future.

that they are looking at this area in
order to “keep the sciences close to
each other.”

The construction ofanew Life
Sciences building would enable
the college to upgrade the Dana
Science Building for Physics.
Kelton said that he hopes Math-
ematics would then be able tomove
into Dana.

Kelton said that his commit-
tee is also carefully watching the
gradual student population growth
of thecollege. Davidson currently
plans to have 1,600 students en-
rolled by 2000. Kelton said that
“perhaps as early as 1994-’95. we
might need one new dormitory.”
He added that such a new dorm is
“certainly likely” to be an apart-
ment style building.

There are also several propos-
als for a new track to replace the
Heath Whittle Track which was
removed from Richardson Field a
few years ago to make room for an
expanded area for soccer. Kelton
said that his committee has yet to

Merrill Earnest, president of the Union Board, hopes to redefine
the role of the Union to appeal to a broader group of students.

dent to write in any suggestions or
concerns so that students can be
best represented.

The PCC, the SGA, and the
Union are planning to work in con-
junction to sponsor a campuswide
event this spring. Earnest sug-
gested a possible concert at the
lake campus but no definite plans
have been made. The combined
efforts could potentially increase
the sense of community on cam-
pus by creating an event which
involves the entire student body as
wellas faculty and administrators.

“The Union has quality pro-
gramming demonstrated by the
overcrowded 900 room for the Ti-
betan monks,” said Earnest. “An
audience of one third students, one
third faculty, and one third com-
munity is ideal.”

The newly selected Union
Board should be more effective
because some committees were
combined or eliminated. By co-
sponsoring events, committees can
make better use of funds to in-
crease the quality of programming.
Also, the Outpost offers a new

location to provide supplementary
social options to Patterson Court.
“I hope to sce the Union ex-
pand to meet the needs of more
Students. This is definitely an ex-
citing time to be involved with the
Union,” said Phoebe Dean, Union
Board Publicity Artist and Mcm-
ber at Large.

agree to one specific proposal fora
track. He said, “That is a campus
need that is being given careful
consideration.”

Kelton also said that his com-
mittee is concerned about the qual-
ity of performance spaces on cain-
pus. He said, “Love Auditorium
does not meetall the [performance]
needs of Davidson. We are look-
ing to what we can do to improve
that.”

Kelton said that when all of
these buildings might be built de-
pends on when the college can get
the money needed for such under-

takings.

Kelton’s committee is also
designing a Campus Master Plan
which will provide basic principles
to operate on in the future. This

plan is in the drafting stages, but

should be in document form by
next fall. It will establish guidc-
lines and standards about building
locations for the future of the col-
lege. It will therefore provide only
basic principles and ideas from
which the college should operate,
but will not be a concrete or spe-
cific map of what the college will
look like in the next decade.
