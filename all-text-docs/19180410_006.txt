The DAVIDSONIAN April.

Red Cross News

.

We wish to call attention to the fact
that the Musical Festival, which is to be
held in Charlotte, April 26-27, is for the
benefit of our Red Cross work. We
should bear in mind that the surgical
dressing and work for the hospitals is
only a small part of the burden the Red
Cross carries. Below is a report of work
in relief and restoration done in France
in the month of February:

During this one month, substantial
aid was given to over a hundred thou-
sand French refugees, repatriates and
other war sufferers. “This number in-
cluded about twenty thousand persons
in the devastated areas, seven thousand
five hundred repatriates in provinces and
nearly six thousand undernourished
Paris schoo! children. More than twen
ty-two thousand people were given hos
pital care during this ane month, includ-
ing thousands of repatriite children at
Evian, and about a thousand tuberculosi-
patients in Paris who were given supple-
mentary rations daily.

Work is now being conducted by the
Red Cross in ninety-cight French citie
and villages, not including the Friends’
Unit which has twenty-one relief sta
tions, or the Smith College Gnit, which
yorks in eleven villages. Nine civilian
hospitals, with a total capacity of more
than a thousand beds and forty-six dis
pensaries give care to children, tubercu-
losis patients and refugees.

Grants of money to French organiza-
tions during the month totaled more
than half a million frane, and, in’ addi-
tion, large quantities of clothing, food
and household goods were distributed.

The Red Cross now has a staff of four
hundred and ninety workers in France,
sixty-six having been added during Feb-
ruary.

Misses Juliette Bristol, Julia Sherrill,
Marie Stephens, Virginia Henkle, of
Statesville, were the guests of the Pi
Kappa Alpha’s on last Saturday.

WILD CATS’ SOUTHERN TRIP

(Continued from page §)
“winning ball thruout both games. He
developed a wild streak in the second
game, but after the second inning he was
just as completely master of ceremonies
as in the first contest.

In the first game the Wildcats hit
everything Asbury and Murphy offered
and stole bases almost at will.

The hard luck that Hengeveld ex-
perienced in the first U. of S. C. game
again presented itself in the second
game. Altho “Dutch” allowed only
four hits, Tech was presented with
enough runs in the first two innings to
put the game on ice. Pruitt also pitch-
ed well, allowing five hits. Each pitcher
fanned four men.

Ingram with a triple in the first game
and three singles and a home run in the
second was the leading hitter for Tech.
Spann was the individual star for the
“Wildcats” with a three-bagger and a
single in the first, and a three-bagger in

the second contest. Score:

OGLETHORPE GAME

By taking advantage of their oppo-
nents’ misplays and hitting Warwick at
opportune times, the “Wildcats” ended
their highly successful march thru Geor-
gia.

Currie pitched a strong, heady game
for Davidson and the Presbyterians
found a tartar in southpaw Warwick.
The Oglethorpe twirler pitched godd
ball, but received poor support.

When we take into consideration the
fact that this game marked Oglethorpe’s
entrance into intercollegiate sports, we
have nothing but praise for their team
in the great fight they put up. The fact
that Davidson won the game promises
nothing for the future. We realize
that we have a new and worthy oppo-
nent in the field of athletics. And we
feel safe in predicting, as we welcome
Oglethorpe into the circle of Southern
collegiate athletics, that in days to come
there will be many an evenly and fairly
contested game fought out in friendly
rivalry when Greek meets Greek—or
Presbyterian meets Presbyterian.

The score: R.
