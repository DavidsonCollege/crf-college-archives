Kruse’s Cubby
Women ona
Mission

By MIcHAgEL Kruse
Sports Editor

I was watching the women’s
national championship game on Eas-
ter night and a hallmate — one of the
few who didn’t skedaddle for Break
*| — walked in. :

“Girl’s basketball?” he said. “I
bet that’s pretty exciting. . .”

His words were nowhere near
the vicinity of sincere.

Well, women’s basketball, and
yes, pretty exciting. Very, actually.

- Why is it so hard for people to
accept women’s basketball as a sport
in its own right — and a damn good
one, at that — and not an undercard
to the men’s game?

Why would so many sports fans
rather watch paint dry than women
_| play basketball?

I would argue ignorance.

So consider this a lesson — a
lesson primarily pointed at the guy
who has either never been to a
women’s basketball game or only
~]| goes to gawk like he would — and
does — at a Playboy centerfold.

The first step is to make our-
selves small - really small - and crawl
inside the mind of this so-called sports
fan.

Let’s listen carefully, and then
respond.

Women can’t dunk.

First of all, untrue. Some can.
And not that beast with the unfortu-
nate gland problem in the Guinness
Book of World Records. (Don’t pre-
tend you haven’t paged through it
looking for freaks.)

Second of all, the kind of fan
who goes to a basketball game to see
dunks, and dunks only, is the kind of
fan who has trouble Understanding
anything else.

Gravity-defying, rim-rocking
throwdowns are fun, but hardly es-
sential to an exciting brand of hoops.

Women can’t shoot.

I have one question. Did you
watch both Final Fours this year?

No? WellI did. Let’s play the
compare-and-contrast game.

The high-flying men were in
Indianapolis, where:

eThe NCAA crowned Arizona
its champion after the Wildcats shot
33% in their semifinal win over Caro-
lina and missed over 60% of their
attempts over the course of the week-
‘| end.

eThe Tar Heels, not counting
dunks, shot 25% Saturday night.

The players blamed windy con-
ditions in the RCA Dome for their
pathetic marksmanship.

Now for the female equivalent
in Cincinnati, where:

*National champion Tennessee
made nearly 60% of its shots in the
title game.

¢Old Dominion’s Aubrey Eblin
nailed a half-court heave at the half-
time buzzer.

¢Stanford’s Kate Starbird, the
national player of the year, couldn’t
miss in the firsthalf, scoring 21 points
in the Cardinal’s semifinal loss to
ODU.

Still think women can’t shoot?

Fine, they can shoot, but the
women’s game is still boring.

As exciting as the men’s final
was, the Stanford-Old Dominion
semifinal was better. The Lady
Monarchs erased a 15-point second
half deficit to force overtime, where
they eventually won 83-82. The

Men’s tennis beats Furman for first time since 1973

By DaLton McLEAN
Staff Writer

The men’s tennis team edged
Furman 4-3 Saturday at Covington
Courts, swaying the balance of
power in the Southern Conference.

The win marks the program’s

first win over Furman (13-10, 3-1
SC) in a generation, and put the
Wildcats (10-8, 4-0) in a position to
win their first regular-season con-
ference title since 1973.

After defeating the Paladins and
a strong East Tenn. St. team this
week, only The Citadel, Appala-

chian St.,.and VMI stand in the way
of an undefeated season for
Davidson.

In doubles action against
Furman, Davidson wontwo of three
matches toclinch the doubles point.
Winning teams were second-seeded
duo Jon Pastel and Scott Briggs and

the third-seeded team of Tyler Epp
and Jeff Tonidandel.

Going into the singles with a 1-
0 lead, Davidson needed at least
three out of the six matches to as-
sure victory. Furman fought hard,

Easter Break was no vacation
for the baseball team, which hosted
Marshall for a three-game holiday
set March 29-30 at Wildcat Park.

But the Wildcats (13-20, 6-9

SC) made

in two years.

(on Satur-

day) were good,” said coach Dick
Cooke. “And emotionally, you

come into

Marshall 4 game, and
all of a

Sophomore Marshall Tyler, a
seldom-used outfielder coming
into the three-game set, played the
role of unlikely hero both days.

Team splits non-conference match-ups

Home, they say, is where the
heart is. But for the baseball team
—— so far this

_.. | season,
home has
been

where the wins are.

The Wildcats are a solid 14-11
at home this year, but have claimed
only one road victory in a dozen

tries. :

The pattern continued in a pair
of non-
league
outings
this week,
as Davidson fell Tuesday at UNC
Charlotte and crushed Wofford
Thursday ‘at Wildcat Park.

' Having already beaten the 49ers
once this spring, a 12-9 victory here
on March 18, the Wildcats missed a

Rain shortens
series with VMI

By MICHAEL KRusE

In today’s hitter-happy brand
of college baseball, pitching has
become somewhat of a lost art.

But in Davidson’s double-
header
against
VMI Sat-
urday at
Wildcat Park, pitching played a
key role in both contests.

Veteran Mordecai Stolk
worked
into the

ning in

and two runs, neither of which
were. earned, sparking Davidson
to a 5-4 win.

And Keydet ace Jay Adams, a
junior who was drafted out of high
school, went the full seven innings
in the nightcap, allowing only four
hits and striking out 10 in VMI’s
8-4 victory.

“Certainly, we wanted to win
two, but a split is OK,” explained
coach Dick Cooke. “They pitched
well both. games and Mordecai
pitched very wellinthe first game.”

Sunday’s game was rained
out, leaving the Wildcats at 15-22,
7-10 in the conference.

After blowing a 4-2 lead in
the-top of the ninth in the first
game, Davidson used old-fash-
ioned fundamentals to manufac-
ture their fifth win in six outings.

Rookie second baseman Drew
Williams, known more forhis slick
defense than a potent bat, came
through with a single in the bottom
of the last and advanced to second
on a wild pitch.

Williams advanced to ‘third
on a Brian Joyce sacrifice bunt,

Consistent play pays dividends for sizzling women’s lax

By WILL BRADSHAW

Winning five of their last six
games, the
women’s
lacrosse
team con-
tinued their impressive play of late
in Saturday’s doubleheader at
Richardson Field.

In the noon opener, the Wild-
cats battled Division III power
Roanoke before finally succumb-
ing, 10-9, but they rebounded at 4

p.m. that afternoon, pasting
Longwood, 22-13.

“We played well today, and we
did some nice things,” said coach
Mary Schwartz. “In the first game,
we just missed opportunities. We
gotevery opportunity to score goals.

“One of things about Roanoke
is that they have been in the Divi-
sion III Final Four a few times, and
teh’ ey
know
how . to
Wy DLE Gere wt,
games. We turned the ball over a

couple times when we shouldn’t
have turned it over. But was happy
with both games.”

In the see-saw contest against
Roanoke, the Wildcats jumped out
to a3-1 lead in the first ten minutes,
but Roanoke closed out the half
with four straight goals for a 5-3
cushion at intermission. ;

Davidson came out strong
again in the second frame,
outscoring Roanoke 4-1 in the first
15 minutes for a 7-6 advantage. But
Roanoke resporided to the Wildcat
run, pulling out the win. ©

“Roanoke they’re Division III
but they’re on top in Division III.
They win all of their games,” co-
captain Sarah Hogan said. “They’ re

-used to always winning, and hey

know what to do when they’re up
by a goal or two. But, we’re just
Starting to learn how to do that this
year.” :
The game did mark a signifi-
cant improvement over last year’s
contest between the two squads,
when the Wildcats fell 19-7.
