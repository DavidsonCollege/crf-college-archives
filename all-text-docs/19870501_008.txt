Baseball loses in Southern Conference tournament —

By MATT NEWSOM
The Wildcat baseball team
had a tough weekend as they
traveled to Asheville for the
Southern Conference Tournament
and were sent home from the dou-
ble-elimination tourney by VMI
in a loser’s-bracket game on Sun-
. day. During Saturday’s action, —
the Keydets had fallen to defend-
ing champion Western Carolina,
while Davidson was defeated by
Appalachian State. -

Davidson and Appalachian
State opened the tournament on
Saturday after rain on Friday set
the tournament schedule back one
day. On paper, the game had the
makings of a pitchers’ duel. Len
Stratton, the 1986 Southern Con-
ference Player of the Year, was on
the mound for the Mountaineers,

while 1986 All-Southern Confer-
ence Pitcher Steve Condon took
the hill for the Wildcats. Stratton
gave up only three hits over the
first seven innings, one of them
being a solo homer by Dave Tur-
geon. Condon scattered four hits
over the first four innings, with
two of them being solo home runs.
However, the Mountaineers
reached Condon for three runs in
the fifth, one in the sixth, and two
in the seventh before he gave way
to. Charlie Winborne, who
finished up the game for David-
son. Bill Masse hit his thirteenth
round-tripper of the year in the
eighth frame for Davidson’s sec-
ond run of the game. The Wildcats
were trailing 8-2 going into the
ninth when Dave DePaul hit his
twelth dinger of the year with
Brian Moure on base as the Cats’

rally caps proved effective. Rob
Zimmerman also took ASU pitch-
ing downtown; but the rally died,
and Appalachian State won 8-5.
The Keydets of VMI were not
kind to Davidson pitching either
as the two teams met in the loser’s
bracket on Sunday. The Cats used
Wilcox, Waitsman, and Win-
borne, but just couldn’t chalk up a
“W” to stay alive in the fight for an
NCAA Regional berth. Wilcox
held VMI in check through the
first four innings. giving up only
two runs, but the Keydets scored
thirteen runs over the last five in-
nings to seal the victory.. David-
son scored all of its runs through
the first six innings and were held
scoreless the rest of the way. Tur-
geon and Alan Lewis each went
three for five in the effort. The,15-
7 final score sent the Cats pack-

ing, and all but ruined Davidson’s
NCAA hopes.

There is an slim, outside shot
for the 1987 edition of Coach
Greer’s team getting an at-large
bid for the 36-team, NCAA tour-
nament. The team’s record now
stands at 23-12 with seven games
remaining. A record of 30-12 with
some impressive wins over the
likes of UNC, Wake Forest,
Duke, and possibly Georgia,
Southern Mississippi, and NC
State could improve Davidson’s
odds for post-season play.

The Wildcats were to have
started a three-Game series with
cross-town rival UNCC last night
at Crockett Park in Charlotte be-
fore hosting the 49ers this after-
noon at 3 pm at Davidson. Tomor-
row the two teams will finish up
the series at UNCC. This Wednes-

Bill Young captures conference singles title

By WHIT WILKS

The men’s tennis team wrap-
ped up its 1987 season this past
weekend at the Southern Confer-
ence Tournament held at V.M.I.
Finishing with 53 points, Coach
Frank’s squad came in third be-
hind champion Furman, 69
points, and UTC, 61 points.

The highlight of the tourna-
ment was Bill Young capturing
the conference championship at 2 |
singles. In winning the title,
Young played wonderfully, ac-
cording to Frank. He: pulled off
impressive head-to-head wins
_ against highly touted players from
The Citadel and Furman, and in
the process, ran his season record
to an astounding 27-6, tops on the

Conference Championship, Fore-

, Foreman. jan a 51 5-

team. Young was not the only Cat
to have a good tourney, as both
Michael Meyer, 5, and Rick
Hodge, 6, also made it to the fi-
nals of their flight. Meyer de-
feated the 2 seed in his flight to
reach the final and then went toe to
toe with the | seed before bowing
out. Hodge traveled the same hard
road to the finals, as he even man-
aged to survive two match points
in the semis. In the final, Hodge
was up a set and leading 5-4 when
he was struck with crippling body
cramps and forced to retire from
the competition. Frank noted that
Hodge was splendid all weekend
and that it was a crime that things
had to end as they did.

Other Cat players were Jim
Thompson at |, Sebastian Koch at

feet from the tacks, he Bete’ the -
floor. In midair, he did acomplete_
360-degree turn, all the while
keeping the ball in one hand, ex-

tended from his body, Finally; _

_ with apparent ease, he slammed it
home. Surely this pectarmence,
turned some scouts’ heads.
Whit’s Answer. A- ‘special
thanks to Rob Zimmerman and.
David Lloyd, et. al., who
explained that the “Home of the —
_ Wildcats” sith (ang Coingion
will sc

3, and Carlos Ortega eat 4.
Thompson finished a strong third
in running his season mark to 22-
11. Koch, who is only a sopho-
more, came in fourth, and Ortega
finished fifth, which means that
he won his last two matches after
dropping the opener.

On the doubles side, Trip
Caldwell and Thompson, 2, and
Meyer and Young, 3, both turned
in third place showings. The tan-
dem of Koch and Ortega finished
fifth at the brutally competitive 1
position. It should be noted that
Thompson and Caldwell had a

season record of 21-6, and this is

particularly noteworthy given the
fact that Caldwell suffered a back
injury last summer and his status

ference goal tender Jim. Kelly,
ext year promises to be a banner
year for the Cats if they can in-
crease their goal production. .
Quotes of the Week. “The
Braves suck.” Bill Masse, junior
David “right fielder, upon
viewing a Braves game on TBS in

the Union or upon reading the ac-

count of one of the Braves’ 11
losses so far this season. “He al-

until even the start of January was
questionable.

Overall, Frank noted that the
Cats won “where we should have”
but that the team was not able to
pull enough upsets as would be re-
quired to win the championship,
given the strength of the field. He
commented that there were really
three teams (Furman, UTC, and
Davidson) which had generally
comparable talent levels. Con-
sequently, the chances of winning
the tourney were much slimmer
than they would be if there was
only one other strong opponent.

The outlook for next season is
very bright, as only two players,
Meyer and Caldwell, graduate.
Doubles teams will have to be re-
shaped, and Frank feels that if this

day the Cats travel to Bulldog
country to take on a tough SEC
contender, 'Georgia. Then the
team will close out the regular sea-
son with games against. NC State,
Southern Mississippi, and Mem-
phis State next weekend.

For the Record: TUrgeon
held the all-time single season
home run record by himself for a
total of 4 1/3 innings before Masse
tied him at thirteen . . . . David-
son continued to hit the long ball.
Unfortunately, the six homers hit
over the weekend yielded only
eight runs . . Major League
scouts have been flocking to
Davidson’s games to check out

Condon, Fitzgerald,. Turgeon,
Simonds, DePaul, Lewis, and
Masse ... . Masse has _ struck

out only three times in 132 official
at-bats... ..

is successfully done, the team will
be even stronger. He looks for
freshman Tim Hagood to move
into the picture, as he performed
very well in limited play this year.
Additionally, two recruits from
Florida and one from Ohio will
strengthen the Cats, one even to
the point of potentially earning a
singles seed.

Finally, Frank noted that Fur-
man loses three seeds to gradua-
tion so he expects the Paladins to
endure a rebuilding year. That
leaves only the Moccasins of
U.T.C. between the Cats and a co-
veted Southern Conference title.
That certainly would be a nice
way to depart from the conference
in 1988.
