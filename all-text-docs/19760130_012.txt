The Joy of Eating

By BOB ENRIGHT and
MARK YOW
Staff Writers

The self selection of eating houses
by freshmen and upperclassmen tired
of Slater Food Services is almost upon
us. The following Patterson Fratern-
ity Court eating houses have submit-
ted information on themselves in
hopes of enlightening prospects.

The correspondents are members of
the respective houses. Their names
have been withheld to protect the
guilty and the biased.

ATO

ATO provides an alternative to
almost everything. For example,
sanity. What other house has mem-
bers that throw themselves into the
creek?

It all comes from the fact that ATO
is the only student-run house on the
court: all house business, including
planning of meals and ordering of
food, is done by students.

The one fortunate exception to this
is in the department of meal prepara-
tion. ATO’s cooks, Sue and Annie,
have been at the house over fifteen
years and their cooking has become
justly famous. The meal-planning
includes one fast-day per term, the
proceeds of which go to fight world
hunger, a 24-hour open kitchen, and
hot breakfast.

_Many improvements have been
made in the house this year, including
a paint job, a new carpet and stereo.
ATO has always been a pioneer of
sorts—it was the first coed house on
the court—and now is blazing trails in
the area of unusual behavior.

The membership is amazingly di-
verse—we even have some paragons
of sanity. It doesn’t matter where you
fit in, or don’t fit in.

Emanon

Far and away the largest house on
the court, Emanon has managed to
combine some of the best eating on
the court with the lowest prices.

The house is in a sense a melting
pot of all personality types on
campus. Some of the plusses of
Emanon include hot breakfasts, des-
serts at lunch, Wednesday night ice
cream parties, bridge parties, and
great cooks.

ETC

Et Cetera (ETC for short) is the
youngest eating club on Patterson
Court. It was founded in the spring of
1974 by a group of rising sophomores
who felt that the other houses on the
court did not provide the atmosphere
or quality of food they desired.

Today ETC serves food to over 62
students. This food is prepared for the
students by two of the finest cooks on
campus, Mrs. Cecilia Conner and
Mrs. Verdie Heath.

These two are more than cooks,
they are an integral part of the
warmth and hospitality that is found
at ETC. As for the food, we let that
speak for itself.

Besides serving food, we also
provide our members with an atmos-
phere for fellowship and interaction,
as well as with social events. t'l'U was
designed for and is continuing to cater
to the interests of the independent
student.

Eating houses

The membership of the house
presents a diverse array of tastes and
interests which stimulates the expres-
sion of individuality in group inter-
action.

Both men and women are welcome
and equal members of ETC. There-
fore, the membership of ETC, its
officers, and the cooks extend a warm
invitation to all freshmen and upper-
classmen who are looking for a
friendly and good place to eat.

Fannie & Mabel’s

Fannie and Mabel’s is named after
its redoubtable cooks, who have been
on the court for over twenty-four
years. This makes the food among the
finest at Davidson.

Furthermore, the kitchen is kept
unlocked for a light breakfast, as well
as for snacks throughout the day.

Among the five houses not affili-
ated with a national fraternity, F & M
features the most extensive social
program. Highlights include pre-bas-
ketball game cocktail parties, our
famous gambling casino, and the
Mike Jones stairway tumbling exhib-
ition, not to mention those good ol’
band parties.

Finally, F & M has the finest pool
table on campus, the only dunkball
court, and some newly upholstered
furniture which makes Fannie &
Mabel’s far and away the finest house
on the court.

KA

Kappa Alpha is the home of
Southern hospitality. It stresses a
strong national fraternity spirit and
brotherhood within the framework of
the Davidson community.

A well-rounded, diverse house fea-
turing a strong social life and a
competitive intramural program, KA
serves hot and continental breakfast,
lunch and supper.

PAX

PAX provides a form for many
people of diverse interests to get
together’. for fun and fine food. We
feature continental breakfast plus
thirteen full meals weekly with op-
tions for half-board.

Our socia! program includes a
variety of activities tailored to appeal
to all types ot persons. We have
ample room for expansion, and extend
welcome to all coeds.

Stop by and see why we’ve ob-
tained the reputation of being the
friendliest house on the court.

Phi Delta Theta

The Delts are very fortunate to
have the two most conscientious
cooks on campus and the food has
variety and is well-prepared.

They serve two full meals every day
(only lunch Saturday) and continental
breakfast at ten. The Delts offer what
is probably the strongest and certain-
ly the fullest social program on the
court, with the three big weekends
plus mountain weekend and notorious
others.

They are a vey close-knit body

drawn together by the friendships
and personalities ot the mempers,
which is, after all, why one chooses a
house.

The best advice for really finding
out about the Delts (or anyone for
that matter) is to talk personally with
some of the members because they are
what makes the house.

PIKA

There are many distinctions that
separate PIKA from the rest of the
houses on the court. The most
important is the food which is
reportedly ‘‘the best on the court.”

Since everybody brags, it must be
true, but if that’s not enough to
attract you, our new stereo or foosball
table may.

The table attracts a crowd of people
before, after, and during meals.

One additional distinction of PIKA
is that there is no hassle over being

national or non-national.

Girls are beginning to play an
increasing role in the house. People
visiting PIKA always comment that
our house is clean. Our new rugs and
hard-working House Manager should
be given credit for this.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon

SAE at Davidson College is a
strong national fraternity. Its mem-
bers are pledged to scholarship and
brotherhood; at all times exhibiting
those manly and noble qualities of a
true gentleman.

enlighten prospects

All pledges complete a rigorous
pledge training program prior to their
initiation into the bonds of fraternity.
The pledge program is designed to
cultivate, in each pledge, a complete
understanding of Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon.

SAE is a national fraternity...it is
not merely an eating club. Our rush
chairmen have combed the Class of
’79 thoroughly. Encouragements
have been given...in total compliance
with the regulations set down by
Davidson College.
