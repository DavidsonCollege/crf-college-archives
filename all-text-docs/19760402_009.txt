Fairies name All-American Weinies

By THE
THREE FAIRIES

College basketball has now
struggled through another
year and deferring to tradi-
tion, we have selected’ our
All-American All-Weinie
team.

Head Schnitzel for this year
is a unanimous choice, Rut-
ger’s pseudo All-American
Phil Sellers, who could be
caught in bed with a 15-year-
old girl and vehemently deny
statutory rape.

Runner-up for Most Valua-
able Weinie is Jackie Gilloon,
another link in a long line of
South Carolina sausages, by
virtue of his self-effacing mod-
esty.

Several special awards have
been designated for other
members of this year’s farters.
The Harry Krohn Memorial
Nerd Award goes by to VMI’s
Kelly Lombard, a Krohn look-
alike.

The memorial Rag Aw-
ard goes to Notre Dame’s
Adrian Dantley for his’ re-
markable ability to stay on the
rag for a record three-year
period. The Dave Meyers
Memorial Ugly Award and an
autographed tube of Clearasil
from Wolfman Jack go to Stan
“Who?” Boskovich, who bare-
ly edged out the entire Fur-
man team.

The coveted Sports Hlustra-
ted Cover Curse Award goes
to Tennessee’s footlongs,
“The Bernie and Ernie Show,”’
who made the cover in order to
lose to VMI.

Finally, this year’s Corndog
Award Committee had to tra-
vel to New York to find Corn-
bread Maxwell and his ostent-
atious foul shooting style.
Coach of this year’s squad is
Dean Smith who secured his
selection by complaining
about TV timeouts.

Honorary Weinie Sports In-
formation Director is once
again Emil Parker. We must
not neglect to mention the

second team Hot Dogs, the
five Davidsan freshmen for
their post-season antics.

We now indict eight play-

.ers, who in our four years of

direct contact with college
basketball have distinguished
themselves with their involve-
ment in the total college
experience and the world of
crime.

Of particular note is Jackie
Gilloon, who continued his hot
dog antics off the court, off the
road, through two cars,
through a hedge, and into a
tree. Drunk and disorderly,
but at least J&ick laid off the
dope that night, as others
cared to indulge.

Among the most illustrious
who have been nailed are Bo
Ellis, and our own horticult-
ural buffs Jay Powell and
Sheldon Parker. Into less
grass, but more of a dope was
Mo Rivers with his brilliantly
planned theft of a bottle of
Excedrin.

The most spectacular effort
provided this winter was the
virtuoso performance of Rich-
mond’s Tony Marshall, who in
one night managed to get
nabbed with credit cards stol-
en from teammates, his own
dope, and several other peo-
ple’s stereos.

Of those who have moved on
to the pro ranks, our two big
men are Tom ‘‘Pinball Wiz-
ard’’ Burleson and Marvin
“Tireiron” Barnes. Barnes on-
ly moved to the college all-
criminal team after a specta-
cular high school felony.

Standing 6’9”’, with a mask,
wearing his letter jacket, and
size 16% sneakers, Marvin
proceeded to hold up a bus for
$4.42 before walking directly
home in fresh snow.

Coach of this fast fingered
squad is Tates Locke, who
committed 9,863 recruiting vi-
olations, grabbed a cheerlea-
der, and got Clemson three
years probation, before seek-
ing asylum as an assistant

apparent that no one in college

sex crime, though Tom Verlin
