‘Cats Face Toughest Test Against ECU

Smith, Gridmen
Prepare For Tilt

By ROCKY CROSSWHITE
Sports Writer

Davidson's  saphomore la-
den gridders face the toughest
test of their career tomor-
row. when they go against
the Pirates of East Carolina
University at 2 p.m. in Rich-
ardson Stadium.

Coach Homer Smith rated
the game as the loughest of
his Davidson career. “If we
win this game Saturday,” ho
sald. “It wilt be the greatest
foathall victory Davidson ras
had tn a Jong time."

Smit suid East Carolinn is
a well-balanced team that is
highly skilied in every way.

“There Is nothing in the
game they (East Carolina)
don’t do well, They are ag-
gressive defensively, very
strona, and they are
coached by one of the real.
est foethall coaches |
know.”

Same football seers have
predicted Davidson hos as
much a chance of beating
East Carolina as it would of
defeating the Green Bay
Packers. “We are going. to
have to plas as hard as we
enn or-we are dead, and then
again we will have to do
something extra, ' Smith suid.

East Carolina has looked
as tough as pre-season polls
predicted. They opened theit
season by clobbering William
and Mary, whom some spocts
writers considered one of the
best team in the conference.
The score was 27-7.

The Pirates then battered
Richmond, 23-7, Both games
were played away from East
Carolina’s field at Greenville,
N. C. and most people feel
winning on the road Is the
tes? of a geeal team.

Bast Carolina runs the sin-
gle wing and is one -of tic
few teain2 in modern tanthall
to emplov this formation. The
single wing uses a sevensman
line with a blocking back,
fullback, tallback and wing-
wack. The chief advantage of
the single wing is that a Leam
can fun a variety of plays
from it, While the main, dis:

advantage Is the distance be-
tween the center and backs—
about three yards.

Piloting the Pirate attack
will be quarterback Nelson
Gravatt trom Burkeville, Vn.
Anchoring the fullback slot
will be Butch Colson, a 197-
pounder [rom Blizabeth Clr.
Last week the sophomore
back compiled [27 yards in
28 cnrries against Richmond's
Spiders.

At tailback will be Neil
Hughes. who ran for 106
yards in 18 carries and pass
ed for andther 40 yards Last
week.

‘in face of the Pirate threat,
Smith and his assistants have
been trying to iron out a fow
weaknesses and prepare for

what they call “our tough-
est game.” |

“Of course, you must ad.
just to the differeni offense.”
Smith said, ‘‘hut we are not
going te make any drastic
changes in our game.” East
Carolina has been Well scout:
ed, Smith said. and the team
Is familiar with the Pirates’
offense.

Smith said he was encour-
aged by the performance last
week. “Jimmy Poole played
one of his greatest foothall
games.” Smith said, “This
yeur Kerry Keith has been
running better than ever be-
fore,"’ according to Sports
fnformation Director John

. Rilgo. “The 295 vards gained

on the ground against Fur-
man is better than any Da-
vidson team has dene in a
long time.”

Davidson defeated Furman
hast week 45-22, offsefling a
foss jo VMI in both teams’
season opener.

Walter Greene, All Confar-
ence candidate und defensive
middle guard, will return to
bis position tomorrow.
Greene was injured eaclier in
the season. Hank Strickland,
a 6-3, 211 pound junior, will
be moved Irom tackle to mid
dle guard on defénse, while
Jef? Pflunger and Gary Hem:
rie will man the tackle slots.

Stasavich Vows
Few Surprises

Gy JIM FREEMAN
Sports Writer

East Carolina Conch Clar:
ence Stasavich promised 4
few surprises for the ‘Cats
tomorrow, including a brand
new offense and a much-im:
proved backfield,

“We will be using a new

offense,’ Stasavich said, ‘we

have used a new offense in
yvery game ro far.”

Stasavich odded that he
does not expoct his Pirates
fo do much passing, ao
fealure which may be en-
couraging to the Witdcais’
youthful defensive secon-
dary. The ‘Cats secondary
allowed VMI quarterback
Charile Bishop to poss fis
way to the Back-of-ihe-
Weck Award a few wooks
ago, but the ‘Cats backs
head improved enough to
throttle Furman’s passer
Clyde Hewell,

Stasavich praised his defen-
sive unit which he said has
developed ‘‘far beyond expec.

tation.” He also lauded his
tailback Neal Hughes. a 165-
pound senior from Asheboro.
Earlier this season the Pi-
tate coach said he foresaw
some problems at the tail-
back slot, bul as the season
progressed Hughes’ play
changed his tune.

Throughout their first. two
games (with William and
Mary and Richmond) the Pi-
rales, who use the single
wing formation, remained a
running team. In their open-
er with William and Mary,
which was dubbed by some
sportswriters az the confer-
ence ‘Game of the Senson."
the Pirates picked up only 32
yards passing but had a

ground bag of 233 yards.
Fullbock Butch Colson, a
sophomore from Elfzabnath
City, came In midway of the
first half agains! William and

Mary whon slarter George

The sophomore sub cholked
up 133 yords In 23 carries to
oslablish himeell as a seri-
ous threal to any defensive
line.

The end spots are cutrent-
Jy Stasavich's biggest hend-
aiche, he said. “The end play
has been satisfactory but not
outstanding, They have drop-
ped a few passes but hnve
blocked pretty well." Spark-
ing the end play will be Jim-
my Adkins. Paul Schnurr,
Joe Teslo and Bob Withrow,

Stnsavich, who was elected
to the Helms Athletic Foun:
dation Hall of Pame and
runner-up for the national
small college conch of-the-
year in 1960, also praised the
kicking. “Our kicking has
improved with the addition of
(Don) Tygon and (Biily)
Wrightman. who averages
39.7 yards a punt.'’

When asked how he rated
Quarterback Jimmy Poole,
Stasavich replied. “He will
be a good test for our de-
fense. Last year he gained
considerable against us and
we will be watching him."

One of those watching will
be sophomore Lackle George
Wheeler, a defensive stand-.
out who recovered a fumble
and intercepted two passes
against Richmond. Wheeler.
conference defensive player
of the week, will be among
those Stasavich will be count-
ing on to put the pressure on
Poole. “This weekend inay
prove very trying for Wheel-
er,” Stasavich said.

Although the Pirates are
Benerally favored to win to-
inorrow, Stasavich is still
maintaining a cautious front.
“They (the ‘Cats? are a real
good football team." he said.
“They have a good offense
and are well drilled.”
