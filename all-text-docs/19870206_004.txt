contemporary China.

Lieberthal, one of the top ex-
perts on-China, is a Ford Lecturer
and the Director of the Center for
Chinese Studies at the University
of Michigan. _

Lieberthal began his lecture

China and Chinese values be pro-
tected from outsiders. This con-

cal change should be. One posi-

tion was that China be united, re-.

taining their values and ignoring
the possibility of technological
advancement if necessary.
Another position was to borrow
technology from abroad in order
to catch up but still retain Chinese

need reform. Deng Xiao Ping,
after the 1976 death of Mao
Zedong, became leader of a coun-
try whose society was in a sham-
bles, had fallen behind the rest of
Asia in many areas and was under
ever-increasing threat from the
Soviets. There was a pressing
need for change.

Lieberthal said the largest
concern of sorne Chinese in light
of the need for reform was for

to do anything necessary to mold
China into technologically dy-
namic society.

Liegerthal said Deng, in his

_effort to tum China_ around,

formed three objectives: eliminate
the bureaucratic hierarchy, en-
courage individual initiative and
talent, and open China to the out-
side world to stimulate the
economy. These efforts were em-
bodied in social, economic and

political reforms.

Lieberthal said that from a
Western perspective, the reforms
seemed reasonable; but, in reality

ers.

Economically, the area of ag-
riculture experienced an enor-
mous growth period. According
to Lieberthal, China experienced
a five year period of unusually
good weather. Because 80 percent
of the population are peasant far-
mers alienated planned economy
and inclusion in the international
market the economy exploded.

Politically China faced prob-
lems. Deng took on the task of re-
habilitating the old leaders left -
over from Mao’s rule. Deng

The reforms seriously upset
bureaucratic relationships so they
are rendered ineffective. Four
main bureaucracies make up
Chinese government: economic,
propaganda, security, and the
Communist Party. The reforms
resulted in a loss of power for
propaganda, security and the
Communist Party.

Lieberthal said another prob-
lem was the reforms were under-
cutting each other. Because of
China’s_ staggering population
their stringent birth control laws
have pushed the birth rate down to

three-and-one-half births every 10
seconds. However, with the in-

e needed to work on the farms.

Lieberthal contends that
China’s future can take one of four
roads. The reforms could get out
of hand and result in a corrupt
political machine controlling the
market. Reforms could work for
the market system with the Com-
munist party controlling but from
a distance providing — the
framework within which the mar-
ket could operate. The reforms
could stagnate. Or could induce
chaos. Rapid industrial develop-
ment would result in 200 million
people needing jobs within 10 to
15 years.

Lieberthal predicts a Soviet-
type state for the remainder of the -
80’s and a major up-surge in mar-
ket economy for the 90's. j
