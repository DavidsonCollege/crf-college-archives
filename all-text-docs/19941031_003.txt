Seniors seek solution for
nameless buildings with raffle

By Mary Laura Moretz

What began as “a farce to glo-

rify seniors,” as senior Chris Hood
describes it, may soon become a
way for students to get involved in
charity fundraising and to name
Martin Court Building F.

When a group of seniors sat
around one night discussing the
nameless status of three of the
Martin Court apartments, some of
them began musing about the idea
of naming it after one of them-
selves.

The idea involves holding a
raffle among seniors to raise money
and then drawing one name to be
the namesake of the building.

Hood, one of these seniors,
says, “Originally it was a total joke,
until everyone said, ‘Hey, that’s

cool. Let’s do it.’” So they turned
the matter over to B.J. Rudell, who
discussed it with Dean of Resi-
dence Life Richard Terry.

Rudell and Terry amended the
proposal to include that the pro-
ceeds could goto acharitable cause
and eliminated one of Hood’ s origi-
nal suggestions: that the winning
student would also be represented
in a statue.

Rudell says, “It’s a great way
to express senior class pride, and
we could raise thousands of dol-
lars for whatever cause we choose,
especially if this becomes some~
thing we do again next year for the
other buildings.”

After hearing the proposal,
Terry says, “It’s a really interest-
ing and fun idea.” He added, how-

ever, that there are a few obstacles
to clear before the plan could be
considered a reality.

First, Terry and Rudell raised
the practical concern of the physi-
cal placement of the name itself.
“We have to think about what kind
of lettering and sign we would use
and where to put it,” Rudell says.

In addition, as the idea passes
through the Development Office
and other college officials, they |
must take into consideration the
effect of the plan on other donors.

Terry explains: ‘We would
hate to diminish the honor and
dignity of the tremendously gener-
ous and selfless gifts that have
gone into the naming of buildings
in the past few months.”

sey, SGA supports co-ed,

upperclass dorm by room >

By Russ Tarver

With seven oppositions and 2
abstentions, the Student Govern-
ment Association passed a resolu-
tion which would allow one
upperclass hall to be co-ed by room.
Duke dormitory would be the likely
site, since it has two bathrooms on
each hall, allowing for single sex
bathrooms.

Senior President B.J. Ruddell
explained that the hall would have

anevennumber of men and women. °
The option to live on the co-ed hall
would be presented in the resi-
dence lottery. Only those students
with the best numbers wanting this
option would live on the hall.

Those opposed to the resolu-
tion expressed concern that this
co-ed living situation would en-
courage pairing sets of boyfriends
and girlfriends, resulting in co-
habitation.

AIDS eduicator and patient to speak

By Russ Tarver

Over the past ten years,
Davidson College has lost at least
40 alumnito AIDS. College Health
Educator Georgia Ringle says that
through this information, “we can
tell that the virus is probably still
alive and well on campus. We know
through stereopositivity tests of
other small colleges that approxi-
mately one in 500 students may be

infected with HIV and not even

know it.”

This information startled jun-
ior Christopher Vargo into action.
“After interning with the
Mecklenburg County Health De-
partment last spring, I became
aware that AIDS was a serious,
very real threat for people in all
types of environments. This
aroused concern for my own envi-
ronment,” says Vargo.

At the Health Department,
Vargo worked with Mecklenburg
County Health Educator Michael
Kennedy. Kennedy talks to people
in various risk groups and discusses
AIDS prevention methods. Vargo
invited Kennedy to present his in-
formation at Davidson.

“I thought it would be a good
idea to have [Kennedy] speak. I
wanted to move beyond the re-
quired P.E. AIDS information ses-

sion from freshman year,” says

Vargo; however, this talk will be

different than usual. Kennedy will

bring an AIDS patient with him.
“T wanted to do something that

would put a face to AIDS and have
Davidson students realize that it’s
not just an abstract virus you learn
