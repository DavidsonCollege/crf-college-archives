Side Lights

BY RICK LOWERY

ACANDIDATE TOLD ME SO....

Evidently, student use of the gym during basketball |

seasons remains a problem. Earlier this year the gym
was opened three nights a week in an attempt to. lose
the existing burden on this single facility. But with the
interfraternity basketball season and varsity practice
sessions, even this plan proved inadequate.

Perhaps the time has arrived to consider construc-
tion of additional athletic facilities. The present gym-
nasium was constructed when the student body number-
ed approximately 700. At the present time, there is little
doubt that these facilities have been outgrown.

The increased size of the student body has created
a need both for more playing facilities and team locker
rooms. In my opinion, the track team, baseball team,
soccer team and tennis team at present have facilities
which are both inadequate and inconvenient. The basket-
ball, wrestling, and swimming locker rooms on the other
hand are convenient to the facilities and areas in which
they practice.

New athletic facilities could be constructed either as
an addition to the present gym or as a complete new
unit. For the sake of convenience and expense, an addi-
tion to this gym would seem most logical.

Such an addition could be built toward the tennis

courts on land used now for parking and small access

road. This building could contain an auxiliary gym to
be used for the “rat” leaguers. In addition, the building
would house several team locker rooms for visiting and
Davidson teams. Provisions for several other handball
courts could also be included.

Recently the tennis and baseball facilities at David-
son have been improved. while neither is perfect (es-
pecially baseball), an obvious improvement has been
made.

The limited nature of the gym facilities has pointed
to another area in which the physical plant of Davidson
could be improved. In light of the number of students
who make use of these facilities from the varsity athlete
to the handball player, I hope that some improvement
can be made in the picture.

BASEBALL BY STRAUSER

This year the ‘Cats find themselves in a unique
position. In college baseball there is a definite scarcity of
capable pitchers and catchers. If a graduating high school
athlete in either of these positions shows a good bit of
natural ability, he finds himself with a tempting profes-
sional offer; those who resist the temptation have no
trouble parleying their prowess into a free ride through
college. Where does this leave Davidson with no baseball
scholarships? The answer has been all too obvious for
the faithful handful who have followed Davidson baseball.

This all adds up to the unique position mentioned
above. Believe it or not, the ’Cats seem to have a pitching
staff this year. Although it’s too early to be speaking in
tongues about Coach Stevens’ mound crew, the combina-
tion of Earl Cole, Paul Briggs, Dave Johnson, Dick
Snyder, Barry Teague, Ronnie Rudolph, and Howard
Bryan could be potent.

Could be? Well, all we can talk about with any cer-
tainty is the showing against Catawba and Pfeiffer. There
is good reason to believe that Bryan may be a capable
reliever—to wit, his stint against a good Pfeiffer team.
Cole has blown hot and cold in his two appearances but
if we may venture a prediction—Cole is going to come
through when it counts. Dave Johnson has a smooth
delivery and has been known to turn in a good perform-
ance on a given afternoon. But then there are afternoons
when he can get no one out—and Johnson remains a
question mark.

Of the remaining three pitchers, Briggs has been the
most consistent deliverer. Paul’s development could be a
key to a good season. Teague, when he is good, is sensa-
tional. And when he is not good... But anyone who
remembers a day not many months ago when Barry took
the mound against G. W. will have to concede that he has
what it takes to play for anyone, anywhere. In all fair-
ness, he starts slowly and it will be at least mid-season
before the questions are answered. That leaves Snyder,
who has no varsity experience. As Eddie Earle will attest,
Dick throws as hard as anyone in the immediate area
and could supply the needed depth to the staff. He is
starting to move the ball around now and is developing
a moving fast ball that could make him an effective
starter. hi lg

Too many ifs? No more than usual, and this cou
be the year for the ’Cats to come through—despite the
‘mole tunnels.in right field.

F agg Grabs Three Firsts
To Pace Phi Delt Victory

The annual IMAC track meet finals, held Wednesday afternoon, brought back
first place to the Phi Delts after an upset ATO victory last spring. The Delts scored 38
points to overpower the field of also-rans, who were easily led by the Betas’ 24

points.

In third place following the
Betas with 14% points were the
Phi Gams, who narrowly beat
out the KA's with 14. The Kappa
Sigs beat out the Sig Eps for
fifth place. The rest of the teams
were generally satisfied to eat
the dust of the front runners
and meekly collect their en.
trance points.

The Phi Delts made the meet
a farce mainly because of the
outstanding showing of fresh-
man John Fagg. His three firsts
made him high point man. for
the meet. His throw of 138 fect
10 inches broke the IMAC record
for the discus by 13 feet. He also
captured firsts in the shot and
high jump. The second place
Betas were also led by a fresh-
man—Mickey Andrews: he set
a new IMAC record with his 23
seconds flat clocking in the 220
yard dash. Andrews anchored
the winning relay team of the
Betas and collected a third for
them in the shot.

end who is now at quarterback
for the ‘Cats, passed and ran
well, according to Dole, in lead-
ing the Whites over the Blues
24-0. Said Dole, “We would like
to have passed more but the bad
weather interfered with our
plans. I was encouraged by
Heckard's performance; I
thought he ran well.” Dole
went on to note that his new
quarterback was the only man
on the White team who wasn't
for the most part a defensive
player this past year.

The first touchdown for the
Whites came on a Heckard re-
turn of a Jake Jacobson punt.
Jacobson's kick carried down
to the 26. where Heckard haul-
ed it in, sidestepped two de-
fenders who went sprawling in
the mud, and ran to his right.
A couple of blocks developed
around the forty and several

came out of the muddy confus-
fon and was all alone for the

Halfback Steve Smith ran 68
yards for one TD and was on
the receiving end of a scoring
pass from Heckard with 12 sec-
onds to go. Gary Waldron set
up the score with a pass inter-

Dole was particularly impress-
ed by the defensive ‘play of ends

Although obviously hurt by graduation, Coach Bill Dole finds cause for optim-
ism in looking forward to another year of Davidson football. After last Saturday's

encouraged by several aspects of the game and the Spring practice session in general.

As Track Team Opens

Five-event man Alan Turner will lead the Davidson

In. the first Pfeiffer game, the
‘Cats looked as if they were go-
ing to run off with the game by
scoring four runs in the top of
the first inning. The early
splurge was capped by a long
two-run home run by center-
fielder Dick Snyder.

Davidson's pitchers, however,
were unable to hold the early
lead. Starter Earl Cole barely
escaped a shakey first inning.
only to blow the lead in the
third, when Pfeiffer scored three
runs. Dave Johnson was just as
ineffective in releif, and when he
left in the sixth, Pfeiffer held a
7-4 lead, Howard Bryan held the
home team batless the rest of
the way, but the ‘Cats were un-
able to cut down the lead.

Bumgardner is the fifth man,
and Ariail is sixth. “Frank and
Meschan are my seventh and
eighth players, and they'll see a
lot of action this year,"’ Fogle

Johnson pitched well. The bat-
ters led by Eddie Earle with
two key singles, and Charlie
Marcon with. a single and a
triple drove nine runs across
the plate, and the ‘Cats won the
six inning practice game 9-3.

Coach Tom Stevens stated that
although he was disappointed
with his team's showing against
Pfeiffer, that their defensive
play and hitting were very en-
couraging. “Our pitching seems
to be a little slow in coming
around,” he said. “We haven't
had a great deal of time to work
out, and several of the boys are
working ott sore arms. We'll be
tough when that pitching comes
around."

The Wildcats’ next game is
against Belmont Abbey at Bel-
mont next Tuesday. After that
the ‘Cats go on the annual
spring trip, leaving Thursday
evening. On the trip the ‘Cats
play last year’s NAIA cham-
pion Georgia Southern twice and
then participate in the annual
Rollins Tournament at Winter
Park, Fla. The other teams are
Rollins, Duke, and Colby
(Maine). After the tournament,
in which each team plays the
other teams twice, the baseball-
ers return home to begin con-
ference play against Richmond.
