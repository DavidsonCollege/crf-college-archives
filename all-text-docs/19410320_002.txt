CLOSING REMARKS—

And so we'come to the end of the road. At
least as far aS this paper and work connected
with it may be concerned. We have enjoyed
it all the way, even when there was lack of
news (which was too often the case) and
time was running short. And so in closing,

ebefore handing over the job to the new ed-
itor, we would like to clear the desk, its draw-
ers, and the trash can beneath it, of all debris,
ideas, facts, and plans, listing these for con-
venience in paragraphs.

(1) Many thanks to those men who have
done “behind-the-scenes” work which is al-
Ways so essential to any project. Paul Bum-
barger, assistant editor, especially deserves |

many thanks for his untiring and always ready
service in the capacity of copy-reader, chief
Bum has worked faith-
fully and well, and gotten no credit at all for it.
Likewis@d@ those junior editors who now be-
come associates and to the contributors go

staff of the Standard Printing Company in
Charlotte, whence this sheet originates, go or-
chids, too, for much patience and kind help.

’

critic, and “brains.’

(2) Add ideas for editorials: the general in-
tolerance at Davidson—among all groups, both
the high and lowly, in those with authority and
without. A general subject, but one which
has endless possibilities. There is much room
for improvement here, slow as it will have to
be. And great changes must come before any
improvement will be evident

(3) Once again a new class is about to be
created within the rising senior class—the
non-recognized seniors, men who have worked
well and done their best, and who now hold

no offices or honors.” Whatever the reason,

this class always is with us, and it is a great
pity that they may not in some way receive the
recognition which they so well deserve. In
most cases this recognition has not been
sought, nor wanted, and that is but all the
more reason why it should come to them.
College honors may mean something now—,
who knows? — but life will tell the final story,
and from them we look for great things.

(4) Phi Beta Kappa has begun a fine plan,
whereby certain freshmen and sophomores
who have maintained high scholastic averages
through their years in college are invited to
the spring banquet. This is offered as an in-
centive to further work, and as some slight rec-
ognition of past achievements, and should en-
courage underclassmen to continue their ef-
forts in order some day to possibly be honored
with the famed gold square on their watch
chain.+

(5) Keep the campus clean? This has been
repeatedly offered‘as a topic for an editorial.

, But if this fault were the worst to be found in
Davidson, then there would be no doubt as

pass the subject by lightly. A good idea, but
we've heard too much about it in the past four
years,

(6) We still think the idea of stapling bal-
lots together at the bottom to prevent mem-
bers of the Election Board from seeing who
voted for whom is a good one. And it is prac-
tical, although it might have to be worked out
more fully.

However, we had our editorial head snapped: |
off after last week's editorial, and if the stu-
dents wish their representatives on the Board
to continue to know exactly who did vote for

whom, and to pass the word about, why that’s

itor, And thanks to the student body for bear-

Once each year the time comes that we all
know as spring. Spring has many features
that identify it, birds, buds and soft breezes.
However, there is another side to it that is not
so-ofiten-conneected with spring, this-is- clec=
tions. Tt never fails, when we enter into the
season of spring we also enter into elections.
\s new men are elected to the various offices
there are the old office holders that must lay
aside their jobs and give way to the new or-
der.

Tonight we, the staff of the Davidsonian,
elected six new men to serve in our places un-
der a new editor for the coming year, These
men have worked hard tor the last two years
and now they get their reward. However, it
is not with these new junior editors that I
want to dwell; | want to “sing the swan song”
for the outgoing juniors that have done their
bit towards giving the student body a paper
for the last three years.

When the time comes to leave an old friend
there is a feeling of sadness. This is the way
that we feel towards the paper because every
Monday night during our stay at Davidson we
have been bound to the job of putting the pa-
per to press. This has created in each of us a
feeling of responsibility for the paper. Many
times there have been trying occasions that
seemed to worry us a great deal, but those
things have only made us feel closer to the
people that we have worked with—and the
sheet that we have worked on,

This column has nearly every week carried |
some thing from our hand that we have felt
might be of interest to the students or might
be a help to some one. We want now to here
say that it has been a pleasure to write these
columns and that we are giving our places to
men that we think will be not only capablé of
writing a column that will be of interest but
also of putting out a paper that will carry the
news and give the students a broadside view
of the happenings of the student body and the
campus.

They will face many hardships as have all
the junior editors in the past and they will find
times that they feel that they won’t be able to
go on. Every one has at some time or another
heard tales of the late sessions held up in the
Davidsonian office or heard of the stories that
have to be written late at night. These are
only some of the few things that they will
face. If you ever find a man saying these
things. take them with a grain of salt, because
he is not really “griping” about the work; we

to do everything! that he possibly can, else he
would not be serving in the capacity that he
has-been elected to. =

May we as the outgoing juniors of the staff
bid you, our readers, a sad farewell. We will
still be here but only one of us will be con-
nected vitally with the paper. We have en-
joyed every minute of the time spent working
on your paper and we are now sorry that the
time has come that we must give our David-
sonian office key to some other man and lay
aside our pencils to assume the role of ex-
junior editors of the Davidsonian.

The educational clinie at New York City
College is about to start a program of guid-
ance for children of elementary and_ high
school, age who find difficulties .in reading.
The clinic will analyze reading difficulties and

Thursday, March 20—‘Flight From
Destiny.” Geraldine Fitzgerald,
Jeffrey Lynn and Thomas Mit-

This movie is powerfully con-

idly true. It tells of a kindly pro-
fessor who is given six months to
live by his doctor, James Stephen-
son. He decides to rid the world
of some’ evil before going, and sets
out upon his mission by attempting
to rid the world of Mona Moris, an
unscrupulous woman who has
wrecked the happy marriage of
Artist Jeffrey Lynn and his wife.
Instead of setting a good example,
he has_ set a horrible example for
young men to follow.

Friday and Saturday, March 21
and 22—"Virginia.” Sterling Hay-

I had the pleasure of seeing the
world premiere of this picture, and
it is really tops. The scene is laid
around Charlottesville, in the heart
of Virginia. ‘The theme of the story
is the love and battle to keep the
old estates out of the “hands of

Yankees. Fred MacMurray works
hard to keep his old home in the
family. Madeline Carrol comes.
South for the first time in years to
sell her old home because she needs
the money so badly. She plans to
sell the home to Stirling Heyden,
of the North, and almost marries
him until she discovers her heart
really belongs in “ole Virginny.”
Carolyn Lee is a scream in her
lines and adds much to the movie.
The setting is ,wonderful and the
sound is very good, but it could
have been made so much better.

This is one of those shows that I

TOM CAUBLE

ON THE: FLUSH WIRE:
An integral part of college life
is the institution of the telegraph,
invented in 1837 by Samuel Morse.
As of

commonly known as “flush wires,”

feminine wires refusal,
are by far the most interesting type
of communication with, which the
college man is concerned, our dis-
cussion will treat mainly with them.
These refusals generally concern
dance week-ends, but may include
any party or function.~
The most common type of “flush”
the

ideas: (1) the element of deep re-

ineludes generally following

gret, (2) the hint or statement of
an important reason for having to
refuse, and (3) the idea of “ask me
again.”

The element of deep regret is
conveyed by various combinations
of “terribly,” “dreadfully,” “awful-
ly sorry,” and like adverbs.

The important reason for having
to refuse generally relates to the
girl’s family or her school as that
is neutral ground and will not
arouse the pangs of jealousy in the
invitor. She might be “forced to
go home” or “have to go somewhere
with her brother” or not have “any
cuts left.”

The “ask me again” idea is sel-
dom forgotten. It may be stated
as such, to-wit: “Please ~ask me
again.” Or in a more suptle man-
ner, “looking forward to seeing
soon,” “thanks much for
asking me,” or in some allusion to
the “next time.”

This type of wire may be further
subdivided into (a) eleventh hour
or (b) notice in due time.

Again the “eleventh hour” flush
is the more common of the two.
They generally roll in from break-
fast through lunch on Friday of

special cases have arrived as late
as the tea dance. Heartbreaking
it is to draw one of these “elev-
enth hour” dispatches.

a

“Notice in due time” is of course
not uncommon and allows the col-
legian a few hours to assume again
the offensive to gain a date.

Thus, “letter follows” is the es-
this type. The young

lady can later expound at length

sence of

and the unwary collegian is apt to
be all-understanding, -

A sample of the perfunctory re-
fusal or notice in due time might
tun as follows: “Terribly sorry.
Can't possibly make it this time.
No cuts left. Thanks so much for
asking me.”

Let us draw a portrait of a cir-
cumstance in which one of these
heart-rending “eleventh hour’’
flushes is delivered. Our hero is
at lunch on Friday of a dance
week-end. He is consuming his
dessert with reckless abandon.
Eagerly he finished this operation
and starts to push back his chair
preparatory" to bounding down’ to
meet the bus.

Then he spies a waiter with a
yellow envelope making his way
toward his table. The room becomes
quict..._The waiter heedlessly hits
a spoon against a glass to com-
mand quiet and makes the presen--
tion,

The envelope is carelessly torn
open (with false bravado) and the
yellow sheet withdrawn. . Deep
melancholy clouds the face of our
hero and another collegian bites
the dust.
