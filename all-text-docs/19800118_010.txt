One more thing—a total out-
rage is going on right now at
Davidson and B&BB feel it is
our duty as responsible journa-
lists to: do something about it.
We're talking about the conduct
of Yates Sealander at the wo-
men’s basketball games this
year.

It started innocently with
mild abuse and playful throw-
ing of ice but now it has gone
too far. Women’s basketball
crowds are hypnotized by his

- shrieks which are reminiscent of

those of the Fuhrer. He terror-
izes opposing players, and
oddsmakers agree he gives the
home team a ten point advan-
tage. Visiting teams now refer
to Johnston Gym as Sealander
Valley. Small children in and
around Davidson follow him in
droves, chanting only, ‘‘Chain-

saw, Chainsaw.’’ Something
has to be done. As Sterling
Martin put it best, ‘‘this is
bad.”

By the ways, Mary Liefsen
(sister of Tom) and her team
come to Davidson next Tuesday
for a big non-conference tilt.
Women’s Basketball Coach
Palmer Muench says he’s hop-
ing for a really hostile crowd
and that any abuse will be
‘‘justifiable.’” Even from you,
Yatesy. Bear. Tar Baby. Later.

Now for the Top Ten—

1. Fido and the Rear Entries
2. Cool Breeze

3. Hurtin’ 4 Certain

4. Guns of Navaronne

5. Bricklayers

6. We Know We're Peripatetic
7. Corpus Cavernosum

8. Old Men

9. True Grits

Wrestlers to face Citadel after loss

By VAN BECK
Sports Editor
The Davidson Wrestling
team, in its first competition
since the holidays, was defeated
by Campbell in a close 27-21
contest Tuesday night. The
Cats were still in contention
with two weight classes remain-
ing, despite having forfeited
matches at 126 and 142 lbs.
Decision victories were
gained by Scott Smith in the
136 lbs. class, Mike Garfinkel at
158 and heavyweight Rob King,
while freshman Tim Brotherton
pinned his opponent at 167. The

balance of Davidson’s points
came on a Campbell forfeit in
the 177 Ibs. class.

Coach Bob Estock was
pleased with the team’s perfor-
mance considering “that Camp-
bell is a pretty good wrestling
school and we gave away two
weight classes.”’ He cited Bro-
therton’s victory on a second
period pin as a good effort.

‘This weekend finds the Cat
wrestlers in Charleston for a
tournament at the Citadel. Up-
coming home matches include
Hampden-Sydney and Lynch-
burg on February 1 and 2.
