Davidson Plunders Buccaneers

By Larry Dagenhart

Just when it seems as if the
world is falling apart, we still have
college basketball. Although many
minds were focused on the Persian
Gulf situation, the Davidson bas-
ketball team managed to pull to-
gether and knock off Charleston
Southern (formerly Baptist Col-

" lege) 92-78 Thursday night.

. Appropriately, the interna-
tional contingentcame through for
Davidson, as the Cats got 16 points
each from Detlef Muschand James
Marsh, as well asa season-high 15
from Janko Narat.

Alsoscoring well were Pat Hol-
loway with 13 and Paul Drobnitch
with a season-high eight points.

Things started slowly for
Davidson, as Charleston Southern

jumped out to a 7-2 Iead on a steal
and dunk by Anthony Houston.

Fortunately, the feisty Wild-
cats quickly answered, and back-
to-back three-pointers by Jason
Zimmerman put them up 10-9.
From there Davidson never looked
back.

The ‘Cats hit 16 of their first
24 field goal attempts, a feat ac-
complished through something the
team has had trouble with until
how--kicking the ball out to the
shooters when the big men are
trapped inside.

“They (Musch and Marsh)
didn’t think it had to go to the
basketevery time,” said coach Bob
McKillop. “We were able to get
some threes on some kickouts,” he
added.

Although the Wildcats cooled
off, hitting only three of 15 over
the rest of the half, they remained
energized by a buzzer-beating Pat
Holloway jumper, and went up47-
36 at the intermission.

The 11 point halftime deficit

‘was_the_closest the Buccaneers

would get for the remainder of the
contest.

The Wildcats concentrated on
running out the clock with patient
offense and eventually got the win,
avenging a 80-76 loss to the Bucs
in Charleston on January 5.

“We're better than our record
demonstrates,” noted McKillop
after the game.

. ‘The players are developing a
sense of trust in themselves and the
chemistry is developing, “he said.

First Place Radford Defeats Cats

By Bruce Balestier

Saturday evening at the Ded-
mon Center in Radford, Virginia,
3,900 fans were witness to a guest
from anotherdimension; Doug Day
made everything in sight, scoring
30 points, including 7 three-point-
ers, 4 of them during a 21-7 run
that settled the outcome in
Radford’s favor.

Day’s hot hand, despite the
fine defensive efforts of the Wild-

cats’ Darry Strickland, turned a

45-45 tieintoa 66-52 Radford lead
with 6:43 to play, and the High-
landers held on for a 78-72 win.

Radford threatened to put the
game out of reach in the first five
minutes of the contest, feeding off
a frenzied crowd and Davidson
turnovers to take a 9-0 advantage.

The ‘Cats, aided by three-point
baskets from Jason Zimmerman
and Paul Denmond, managed to
stop the bleeding, but the High-
landers continued to lead, and en-
joyed a 21-12 edge with 9:05
remaining in the half. —

But Janko Narat proceeded to
take over the game for the ‘Cats,
scoring 13 points (among them 3
three-pointers) during a 5:17 span
late in the half to bring his team
back. Jason Zimmerman’s three
free throws with :02 left cut the
Radford lead to 33-31 at the inter-
mission. ae:
