Resident students are requir
ed to take their meals in the
College Union,

a “delegaimatdarge from the
student bods.” Watson listed
four North Carolina schoola —
Mars Hill, Pfeiffer, St. Andrews
and Catawba =- among the 92
members.

“The big piteh they made to
us,’ Watson sold, “was that if
Davidsen joined, then schools

follow, We can benefit them, but
they could benefit us little.”

Watson repeated, howover,
that it is doubtful that Davidson

Oh, aure, you've been busy, what with going to classes, doing
your homework, catching night crawlers, getting marriod,
picketing— but can’t you pause for just s moment and give
thought to that dear, dedicated, lonely man in the bly white
house on the hill? I refer, of course, to Prexy.

(It is Enteresting to note that college presidente are al-
ways called "Prexy.” Similarly, trusters are always called
“Trixio.” Associste professors are always called Ary Play
Bursary are called “Foxy-Woxy.” Studenta are called

“Al ae.'”)

ut I digress. We were speaking of Proxy, a porsonage
at once a and pathetic. Why pathetic? Well, sir, con-
sider how y apends hia days. He in busy, busy, busy.

Ho talks to deans, he talks to professors, he talks to trus-
teen, he talks to alumni. In fact, he talle to everybody Ox

t the one group who could lift his henrt and rally his
spirits. I mean, of course, the apyealingent, undearingeat,
Fingomest group in the entire callege—delightful you, the
students.

Tt in Prexy’s sad fate to be forever a stranger to your
lsughing, golden sobvea. Ho can only gazo wistfully out the
window of his big white house on the hill and watch you at

our games and apoets and yearn with all his tormented
wirt to bask io your warmth, But how? it would hardiy
be fitting for Prexy to appear ono day at the Union, clad in
on old ro blazer, and cry gaily, “Heigh-ho, chaps!

will naturally be a little shy at first, s0 you must put him ut

little sunshine into your drear and blighted life!’ Then
