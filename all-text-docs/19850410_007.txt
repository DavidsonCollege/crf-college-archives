To A Winning Season

By PATRICIA HAHN and
LEE LUTZ

The past two weeks have been
busy for the Davidson Women’s
Tennis team. With at least eight
matches left in the season, the
team’s record is now 11-3.

On March 24th the Lady Cats
travelled to Atlanta and were de-
feated 8-1 by ACC Division I
school Georgia Tech University.
The following day the team de-
feated High Point College 8-1 at
home. On the 26th, the Cats were
on the road again—this time to
meet Wake Forest University,
also an ACC Division I school.
Playing on what Coach Caroline
Brown termed “the fastest courts
east of the Mississippi,” the team
met defeat at the hands of the
Demon Deacons.

Returning home, the Lady
Cats rallied to a 6-3 victory over
East Tennessee State University.
Senior Captain Tricia Ives said,
“It was a good revenge match; we
lost to them 5-4 last year.”

Moving ahead non-stop, the
Davidson women claimed a sound
7-2 victory over Kalamazoo Col-
lege, host of last year’s NCAA Di-
vision III Nationals. Early Satur-
day morning it was on the -road
again, this time to play East
Carolina University. Mirroring
their fall scrimmage against ECU,
Davidson beat them 6-3.

On April Fools’ Day the Cats
chalked up another win against
Furman University. Tied 3-3 fol-
lowing the singles, the doubles
brought it down to the wire. The
first two doubles matches gave a

After Sow Start

Cats Are In Position

By EDWIN PAGE

Last weekend, the Davidson
Wildcats baseball team traveled to
Charleston, S.C., for a crucial
three-game series. with The
Citadel.

The Cats were riding high
after trouncing Warren Wilson
17-6 on Tuesday and defeating
UNCC 10-8 on Wednesday. The
team was led by freshman Allen
Lewis’ two homeruns (numbers
eight and nine for the year) and a
solid performance by freshman
pitcher Darryl Bego. The victory
gave the team a 2-0 record against
the cross-county rivals. A week
earlier, the Cats had traveled to
first place Western Carolina and

split two games in a rain-shor-
tened series, giving the team a 3-4
record in the conference.

The weekend got off to an in-
auspicious start Friday as the Cats
dropped the series’ first game 6-5.
But the Cats rebounded to take the
nightcap by a_ 12-4 tally.
Freshman Dave Fitzgerald col-
lected his fourth win and sopho-
more Keith Helfant got four hits.
On Saturday, sophomore Steve
Condon started for the Cats and
went seven innings, leaving with
the game tied 8-8. Helfant had
another fine day with four hits,
one of them a two-out, ninth-in-
ning homerun that broke the dead-
lock and gave the Cats a 9-8 vic-

5 ironically may have been, accord-

victory to each side. The match
now rested on the number one
doubles team of freshman Amy
McNelis and junior Caroline
Barclay. After splitting sets
McNelis-Barclay pulled out a 6-4,
0-6, 6-1 victory.

The Lady Cats had a practice
day Tuesday before resuming ac-
tion against UNC-Greensboro on
April 3rd in Greensboro. UNC-G
lost to the Cats 9-0 in the fall
scrimmage season. April 4th the
team rallied against UNC-C here,
and Sunday, April 8, the team will
match up against Presbyterian
College at 2 p.m. on Davidson's
own turf.

With several formerly ailing
members returning to the court,
the team looks forward to a con-
tinued winning season.

Despite Loss To USC

Netters Continue To Improve
Before Conference Tournament

By JOE JOHNSON

As the weather goes, so go the
Davidson netters.

In the second official week of
spring, Coach Jeff Frank’s
freshman-dominated squad
dropped only three matches in
sweeping past Harvard University
“B,” Ohio University, The
Citadel, and Belmont Abbey.
They finished the week with what

USC is currently ranked 12th in
the nation and tends to play espe-
cially well on the exceptionally
fast courts of Columbia, S.C.

The Cats played a solid all-
around match in squashing Har-
vard 8-1 Wednesday at home. The
day’s highlight was number-one
singles player Sedge Gray's three-
set victory over the Crimson’s
Paul Palandjian. The Davidson
co-captain repeatedly amazed the
home crowd with a delicate volley
and a flawless pronunciation of
his opponent's last name.

The next day saw the hard-hit-
ting Ohio team fall 7-2 despite a
sub-par showing by the Wildcat
doubles teams. On Friday, how-
ever, the Cats were nothing short
of spectacular in dismantling
Southern Conference opponent,
The Citadel, in Charleston, S.C...

without dropping a single set.
Monday's 9-0 yawner set the
stage for Tuesday's trial in Col-
umbia. Freshmen Jim Thompson
and Rick Hodge garnered David

son's only win, a 6-4, 6-2 third
doubles triumph. Hodge also ex

tended USC's number five singles
player, 1984 NCAA tourney qual

ifier Young Min Kwon, to three
sets

Look for continued improve
ment for the 14-8 Cats as the
Southern Conference Tournament
looms closer, especially in dou
bles. Since a mid-season line-up
change, the Cats are 21-9 in dou
bles.

To Control Conference Destiny

tory. Freshman Charles Winborne
pitched two scoreless innings to
get the win. For the weekend Hel-
fant was ten for 13, boosting his
average to .396.

On Monday, the Cats jumped
out to a 10-2 lead against Wake
Forest, aided by a Bill Masse
grand slam in the second inning.
Sophomore Billy | Waitsman
started for the Cats, but was re-
placed by Bego when he injured
his hand. Bego pitched well, leav-
ing in the seventh with a 10-4 lead
and two men on. Fitzgerald came
on but was unable to contain the
Deacons. The Cats escaped more
serious damage when Masse gun-
ned down a man at the plate to the

inning with the score 10-7.

Junior Scott Weaver came on
in relief of Fitzgerald but was also
ineffective. After surrendering a
solo homer in the ninth, Weaver
had two outs and only one man on.
The batter hit a looping line drive
to center. Masse charged the ball
and attempted a sliding catch, but
was unable to hang on. Weaver
walked the next batter to load the
bases and then surrendered a
grand slam that gave Wake a 12-
10 victory.

Despite Monday's disappoint-
ing result, the Cats have been
playing well of late, winning five
out of their last seven. The pitch-
ing must become more consistent,

but the Cats have a fine chance to
qualify for post-season play. Both
The Citadel and Furman have
seven conference losses while
Davidson is now 5-5. Only two
more weekend series remain on
the conference schedule and the
Cats play both at home. The team
is in the enviable position of being
able to control their own destiny.
If they win both of the remaining
series they will almost assuredly
make the playoffs.

On Friday the Cats take on a
fine Clemson team at home and on
Saturday Furman comes to town
for a double-header and a single
game on Sunday, both beginning
at | p.m.
