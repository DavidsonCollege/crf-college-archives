“Poor Richard.”

DRINKING ae “As rare as a flask at a Dav-
idson game,” is the new simile now employed
to express a phenomenon by Charlotte writers.

«During the past year, Davidson students,
faculty members, and trustees approved the
policy of reading a scatement at football
games requesting that there be no drinking at
Davidson College contests on Richardson fictd.
Prineeton, through President Dodds. politely
informed the publie that drinking would not
be ivierated on its premises.

The University of Tennessee joined in the
crusade with Davidson, to be followed by |
Duke University, if editorial policies mature.

“It is admittedly a hard problem for the
college authorities to handle, and while they
may never be able entirely to wipe out this
evily the experience of Davidson College has
been wholesome at least to the end of creating
a psychology against this disgusting Pre
on the part of patroas of its games,”
The Charlotte Obdserver.

The adea of eliminating drinking at games
was carried through under the leadership of
Mr. F. L. Jackson. We hope other colleges
will follow plans which

|\Campaigning....

Jt has been a Jong time since ‘anything has
caught the faney of the student body like the
current political campaign. So far even the
most heated arguments have been iriendly and
good natured and even the most viotent parti
sans have kept their tempers. Everyone seems
to be having fun.

As this goes to press we do not know the

‘| outcome of the meetings last night and this

evening. But we hope the speakers received
a less enthusiastic hearing than was accorded
the student campaign managers in chapel
last week.

A current criticism of the American collegc
| Student is Uhat he takes no interest in nationa!
alfairs. We teel that our stadent body in its
recent activity has conelytsively disproven that,
as much as it has disproven the old adage that
polities must be inevitably aecompanied by
mucd-slinging and ill feeling.

‘Fhat Roosevelt led by sueh a large majority
in our cecent poll is no cause for wonder.
Rather it is to be wondered at that Landon
receive any votes at all in a Southern college
such as this one. Tuck to both sides, and may
tlie best man win!

a
ind C.C.P.A. Convention. .

The N.C. © B. A. convention proved to be
very helpfal to those who attended from
Davidson during the past week.

Benetits derived from the conclave would
include the exchange of ideas, social contacts,
inereasing the general interest of colleges and
institutions in this state for one another, and
the enlightening talks by experienced news-
paper men.

‘Lights Out’....

Sinee repetition is the first, second and third
law or learning we want to again endorse our
Ipiea for better lighting in Chamber’s Audi-
torum. Hlonest. Mr. Treasurer, all we want

is a chance to see what pur speakers look

like. And we could have better lighting with
less current.

[ would like to discuss another subject at this
time.

Sportsmanship here at Davidson is a thing
seldom spoken of but always in evidence. It
has become such a part of most of us that
if 4$ praeticed almost unconsciously. It is,
one might say, a part of our campus code, and
consequently, when someone makes an infrac-
tion, no matter how slight, on this, our sports-
manship, it is at onee evident and often em-
barrassing.

A sportsman has been detined as “One who
is fair and generous " sports: 2 good loser
and a graeefui winner.’

Our football team is noted for its ever
present sportsmanship, and this past week-
end was no exception, but some members of
our Student Body, by their actions at the Cit-
adel game, did not show their loyalty to the
college and to our team in this respect.

Davidson covets for itself position of dis-
tinct— leadership- in sportsmanlike conduct
among Southern colleges and universities. Its
sportsmanship exhibited towards other teams
and other Student Bodies is an indelible meas-
ure of its greatness. The individual who by
word or action tends to bring discredit-to her
name is undesirable.

A true sportsman always realizes that the
reputation of the entire college may be tainted
by the unsportsmanlike action of one indi-
vidual.

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1936

| OPEN FORUM

Dear Editor:

The president .of the Student
Body inearred grave possibilities in
speech at the Wednesday morning
assembly, Just what its affect on
the freshman class will be is a mat-
ter for conjecture.

Not that we condone HAZING in
any shape or fofm, but a certain
amount of disciplinary paddling
seems to us one of those “essen-
tial traditions” of campus, life. It
has survived continuous and vigor-
ous opposition in all American col-
leges almost from their foundation,
and this survival is itself evidence
of a definite need.

We were all freshmen once, and
all subinitted more or less cheer-
fully, to the pranks of playful up-
per classmen. And to be. a fresh-
man. is an essential part of every-
one’s experience — to learn to take
it, to submit with grace to a tem-
porarily unpleasant situation. “Fe
who gives orders must know how to
take them.” And the duties required
of freshmen on this campus are
little more than the dictates of com-

mon courtesy and a respect for
one’s elders, The yearling who
avoids these regulations deserves

chastisement.

The first year men expect a cer-
tain amount of paddling. Some of
them will go to extremes of “horsi-
ness” and impertinence to obtain it.
The few wha seriously object, fo
this mild horseplay ‘are no more
typical of the Davidson student
body than those few upperclassmen
who would persist in the older,
more brutal form of hazing.

WE do not question the action of
the Student Council in its sentence
fo? hazing; we do not have all the
facts of the case. But the ques-
tian scems to us to be more one of
sportsmanship than anything else.
Hazing as such died out on this
campus many years ago, we, are
sure it has not been and will not
be revived. The whole matter scems
to be much to do about nothing.
For after all it is a matter of give
and take. Freshmen take it now
and dish it out for the next three
years. There is nothing shameful
about it, nothing humiliating.

There is some slight physical dis-
comfort involved, matter which
passes in a moment. Often the
sound of the paddle is drowned by
the laughter of the supposed vic-
tim. As long as Davidson upper-
classmen are gentlemen (we assume
they are) they will not abuse this
privilege through which they can
render invaluable aid to the incom-

ing class.
Don’t let the fact that some
freshman was unduly excited by

one of those famous “prayer meet-
ings” remove all means of discipline
from the upperclassmen.—D. T.

Vowles Writes Article

In the Modern Language Journal
for October 1936, appears an article
entitled “Norwegian Loan-Words,”

‘by Dr. G. R. Vowles, Professor of

German.

The editor of the Journal says, in
“Among Our Contributors:” “Guy
R. Vowles, Professor of German in
Davidson College, has been a ‘val-
uable contributor to-the Journal,
his latest previous article, ‘Vagaries
of the Modal Auxiliaries in Ger-
man,’ having appeared in the March
1935, issue.”

—last weck saw a gathering of all —
the collegiates, in North Carolina
who have sold their souls to the
printer’s devil, editors, managers,
and other public enemies. Festivi-
-lies were opened with a tea at the
Charlotte Hotel—and the funny
thing about it was, they actually
served TEAT Up on the tenth flor
they had better ideas than that.

_ —o—
Friday afternoon the ‘boys and
girls of the press-club were fed in
Chambers. In fact, everybody was
pretty well fed up before it was
over.

. —o—

From what Kernel hears, our Ed-
itor in Chief and Business Manager
must have given one Nozy Broom

}material for at least two éolumns.

They're liable to pay out all their
earnings in hush money.
—o— ;
The Observer says that 7,500 peo-
ple saw last Saturday’s massacre
of The Citadel. Why not be broad-
minded about it and include the
visiting bands under the heading
of people? That would bring the
total up nearec. nine. Everybody
who couldn't get a ticket just bor-
rowed junior’s piccolo or harp and
walked right in, They really came

out on the national anthem. Ten
people in Charlotte turned down
their radios to listen. And I dare _

you to prove that's not so.
—o—

aThe local band really went to
town on “London Bridge Is Fall-
ing Down.” Kernel suggests that a
coin be tossed to decide whether
the next new tune learned shall be
“Ring Around the Rosey”
“Christopher Columbus.”

—o—

That exhibition of drill put on by
The Citadel cadets. was beautiful
to watch. We understand there is
still a greenish cast to the local
staff. Wonder what would happen
if the platoons walked through a
couple of yards of banana skins?
Interesting thought.

Serious suggestion: Why would-
n't it be a good idta for the powers
that be’ to pick a platoon of the bet-

Despite the campus ban on stu-
dent “politicing” that seems to be
about all that’s thought of here-
abouts these days. “My fraaands!"
is a cry used here so often that.
most of us say it in our sleep. As
yet there has been no bloodshed,
but one or two more talks in cha-
pel should see Chambers floating
away in a crimson stream.

—o—

Only one thing is lacking (dis-
tressingly lacking) to make this
campus a small replica of the na-
tional political stage. That one
thing is, nobody scems interested
enough in his candidate's welfare
to be free-handed with cigars. True,
a prominent GOP did dispense a
few on the stage the other day. But,
darn it, he took them back again.

By the way, did you know that
two of our number cast ballots for
Browder in the recent poll? That's
carrying loyalty to your school col-
ors a bit too far. If Haile Salassie
ran with him for vice-president,
they’d probably carry the student
body.

The, Masquers are rehearsing “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream," with
a cast that will make history. Wait
till you see Thisbe with her long —
flowing curls, and the hero with
love in his eyes. By the way, the
casting director showed consider-
able foresight.
