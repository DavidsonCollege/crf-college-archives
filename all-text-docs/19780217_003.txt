Publications Board organizes

By SALLIE SUMMEY
Staff Writer

Davidsonian editor Phil Dun-
can and Miscellany co-editor
Patsy Daniels will lead the
student Publications Board in
the coming year.

In its meeting last week, the
board, which consists of the
editors/managers and business
managers of Davidson’s five
student media operations,
elected Duncan chairman and
Daniels secretary, chose Quips

and Cranks co-editor Steve
Cline as the media representa-
tive to the Media Board, and
discussed plans for 1978.

Duncan said that the duties
of the Publications Board -are
currently rather nebulous.

“The College Constitution a-
dopted in 1976 set up the Media
Board and gave to it some of the
responsibilities previously
handled by the,Publications
Board,’’ he explained.

“Since 1976, no one has been
certain of the role on the

program needs
more coordination

feel like they belonged?’’ Kemp
asked.

Kemp noted the constant
turnover in Davidson's Interna-
tional Education Office as one
of the major problems of inter-
national studies. ‘‘Every year

son College could do to make
students, who will be leaders of
the community more interna-
tionally aware. Otherwise,

ism,’

Publications Board—what it is
supposed to do for the student
media, how it is to cooperate
with the Media Board, and so
forth.”

In the coming year Duncan
hopes the Board can eliminate
these uncertainties and esta-
blish semi-formal operational
guidelines.

In discussion at the meeting,
the Board expressed a desire to
take a more active role in
screening of candidates for me-
dia positions and considered
sponsoring visits by media pro-
fessionals to Davidson.

All present agreed that the
Publications Board should co-
operate fully with the Media
Board and assist it in serving as
a forum where students can
voice complaints or suggestions
about the student media.

The Publications Board
meets next in mid-March to
discuss the budget proposals
each media will submit to the
Activities Tax Council.

there’s someone different in
that office. What we need is a
full tenured faculty member to
serve part time or a trained,
experienced director of Interna-
tional Education.”’

Kemp said that there was
also no coordination between
the various directors of David-
son’s junior year abroad (J YA)
and term programs.

Originally the International
Education Committee, a faculty
advisory committe, evaluated
Davidson’s programs, and
helped select students for these
programs. “The International
Education Committee no longer
serves any function,’’ Kemp
explained. ‘The responsibility
for selection, evaluation and
problems of each programs has
been handed over to individual
departments."

Awareness group planned

International student Youssef Abagui is organizing a group,
under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A.’s new Seventh Block program,
to increase the college community’s awareness about the various
points of view on political, religious and environmental issues.

“The principle of a liberal education is not. complete unless one
hears all sides of an issue. Our goal is not to push any specific
ideologies, but rather to enable students to gain a clearer insight
into their own. We hope to help the college community experience
different values of various countries,”’ said Abagui.

Some of the activities the group plans include contributing to
recycling, holding symposia on religious issues, and public
debates.

The group shows films on various religions on Friday mornings
at 10. This Friday a film on Buddhism will be shown.

An exhibit of Mid-Eastern countries with meals,
dances, is being planned for the spring.
