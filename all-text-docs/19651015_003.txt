Buttrick To Return

For Chapel,

The Rev. George A.-Buttrick,
visiting professor at Northwest.
ern University in Evanston, IIL,
will be guest speaker at Vespers
Sunday.

Buttrick, a native of England,
was for many years pastor of
the Madison Avenue Presbyte-
rian Church in New York City.
He later became preacher to
the university and professor of
Christian morals at Harvard
University.

Chaplain Will Terry says of

Buttrick, ‘‘He is keenly inter-
ested in Davidson; more than
in most places, and most con-
cerned and most upset at
times."’. His ties to Davidson

Dormitories To Get
More Telephones

Five public telephones will be
installed in dormitories on cam-
pus on or around November 5,
Mrs. Peter Nicholls, dorm su-
pervisor, reported Wednesday.
A new booth is also to be added
in the basement corridor of the
Union Building.

Four of the phones are to go
on the third floors of East, Can-
non, Little and Watts dorms
to relieve the bottleneck of calls
created because freshmen do not
have access to phones in the)
fraternity houses. The fifth
dorm booth will be in the cen-
tral portion of Duke.

A petition from a group in
Watts and some general requésts|
from freshmen, Mrs. Nicholls
said, were responsible for the
action.

“The ones in the freshman”
dorms will be public phones,"}
she went on to explain, that is, )

Whoever would have thought that the faculty
could beat the freshmen in athletics? Absurd! Well,
they did!

The faculty did edge the freshmen in the soft
ball and golf competition of last week, but only be
ause of several! rather underhanded tricks perpe
trated by the teachers.

On Oct. 7 the teachers took the field against
a non-existent freshman softball team. The reason
the freshman didn’t show was that there was no

publicity of the game whatsoever. Underhanded trick
number one!

When the faculty foresaw the embarrassment
of beating no team at all, they immediately sought
out some of the worst freshman clods of all, those
on the fourth floor of East Hall.

Everyone knows fourth East has only the kind
of guys who would drop water balloons on their bud-
dies waiting to make phone calls far below. Get
ting the worst opposition possibie was underhand-
ed trick number two!

U. T. number three occurred when the faculty
started scoring runs. Coach Driesell hit several
home runs and the teachers’ score mounted to an un-
believable total of 25.

Nine Get Approval
For Vespers Option

Nine Davidson students of the
Catholic, Jewish and Greek Or-
thodox faiths have elected to at-
tend churches of their own faiths
away from Davidson.

They secured permission to
do so under the provisions of
last spring's modification of the
Vespers attendance rule passed
by the faculty’s Religious Life
'|Committee. Dean Richard C.
Burts emphasized that the new
rule does not apply to Protest-
ants or to students considering

| changing their religious affilia-
tion.

The students who are taking
advantage of this option are re-
} quired first to inform Burts of
|the location of their church.
|Each Monday after attending
jservices they go to his office
‘and sign the regular attendance

; card.

Churches which the nine stu-

|}dents have chosen to attend are

|St. Theresa in Mooresville, St.

Patrick in Charlotte, Temple

| Beth-El in Charlotte and Holy

~~, Trinity Cathedral (Greek Or-

thodox) in Charlotte.

A picnic supper and combo
| party will highlight .tomorrow’s
post-game activities the
Union Social Committee, Fresh-
man Council, Social Council and
“Cupid Computer’ join forces
to entertain students and their
dates,

The supper. which offers ham
and roast beef sandwiches, po-
tato chips, apples and cookies,
and" the dance, which features
“The Embers,”’ are the respon-
sibility of the Social Council.

The supper will begin at 5,

cents, but Salem freshmen will
get theirs free. The dance fol-
lows, from 7:30 to 11:30 p.m.

The freshman mixer with Sa-
lem is being handled by the
Union Social Committee in con-
junction with the Freshman
Council and Davidson's hard-
working IBM computer.

“The mixer will be run just
like the others, except that this
time we've had the boys sign
up,"’ said Dave Powell, fresh-
man adviser and Union Social
Committee member. “That way
we hope to avoid complica-
tions.”

Powell said that there was
“apparently pretty much inter-
est among the Salem girls’’ and
that about 90 freshmen, about
one-half of the class, had signed
up to participate.

According to Powell, very few

Meanwhile, the surprised freshman were amass-

plished that if pinch hitter Dave Fearnbach hadn’t
clouted the game’s longest homer into the right

field trees.

Some of the “bad guys” who played were Prof.
Peter Van Egmond, Dr. Max Polley, President D.
Grier Martin, and Coaches Lefty Driesell and W. E.

Mitchell.

Some of the freshmen who participated

were Steve Faulk, Dave Fearnbach, Bobby Vagt and
