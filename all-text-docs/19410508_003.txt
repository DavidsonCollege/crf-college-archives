Atong with many other American
colleges at that time, Davidson re-
ceived its unit of the new R. O. T.
C. Since that September in 1920, |
seven hundred graduates of David-
son have received commissions as
Second Lieutenants in the U.S. Re-
serve at the average rate of 35 a
year,-and- thousands*ot others have
taken the basic* course their first
two years. Among the graduates
with commissions—some in the

the Air Corps and Marines—are one |

of what was then called the Student

Army Training Corps. At the close

of the war, the S, A. T. C. was dis-
solved, but there was some senti-
ment that such an organization

ought to continue, and so when the
R. O. T. C. Act was passed, a unit
was obtained here in spite of some
opposition on the grounds that mili-
tary training was at odds with the

high purpose of the college. Since

then: military training’ has proved
its worth. Since 1928, the local unit
has retained its yearly inspection

rating of “excellent.”

DeAt present, the R. O. T. €
is required of all first and second

missions in the infantry were grant-
ed, now a young officer at Davidson

may specialize in Infantry Air
Corps, Non-flight, and Signal Corps.
The student is welk-grounded in
military, and at graduation is fit-

ted to handle men and equipment,
make and read maps, direct recon-

naisance, combat work and  com-
munication. Next summer, due to
the emergency, the War Depart-
ment may establish a summer
camp for the further training ‘of
students.

Since its establishment in 1920,
