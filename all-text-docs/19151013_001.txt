Y. M. C. A. MEETING.

At the regular meeting last Thursday
night the Y. M. C. A. was favored with
a talk by Dr. Rolston. of the First Pres-

byterian church of Charlotte.
Dr. Rolston spoke on “What It
Means to Be a Christian.” He first

outlined the life and perfection of Christ
and showed that it was inexplainable
unless He was considered divine. Chris-
tians means ‘Christ's Ones.” A person
is not a Christian unless he belonus t

Christ. This includes not only faith hi
works. He who is a Christian must lov

Him. talk with Him. surrender himselt
to Him. He must belong to Christ al
together.

One of the most delightful events of
the trip to Atlanta was the banquet
given the Squad bv the Davidson
Alumni of that citv. Tt was under the
management of Mr. Caldwell (‘o.1).
who also acted as toastmaster. The
banquet was held in the Rainbow room
of the Rathskeller of Hotel Anslev. Whe
following sumptuous menu was served:

Crab Flake Cocktail

Cream of Tomato. au Rize.

Spanish Olives
Pineapple Fritters, au Maraschino

Stuffed Jersey Chicken

Brussels Sprouts. a |’ Francaise
Merrv Widow Salad

Pistachio Ice Cream and Assorted Cake
Coffee

After the banquet the toastmaster in-

troduced Mr. Parry. president of the
Alumni Association. He welcomed the
team to the citv of Atlanta and com-
mended them for the “bull dog” fight
thev put up against Tech.

The toastmaster then called upon
Coach Fetzer for a few remarks. Ina
pleasing manner he thanked the Alumni
for their hospitality and undivided sup-
port.

The Association presented each mem-
ber of the Squad with a complimentary
ticket to the Forsyth Theater, where an
attractive bill was rendered.

characterized for their loyalty, and those
of Atlanta-proved themselves still de-
voted sons of their Alma Mater.

Yellow Jackets Have
to Fight Hard to Win

Superior Weight of Tech Team
Tells in Third Quarter.

Tn the game plaved last Saturday,
'Vech, though expecting a reasonably
hard game, did not seem to realize just
how hard they would have to work for
their victory until the third quarter roll-
ed around,

Vhengh the Red ‘and Black team was
outweighed many pounds. to the man,
they outplaved the heavier Jacket aygre-
gation during the first half of the game,
and ‘Pech supporters began to get nerv-
ous. At the end of this half the score
stood Davidson 7. Tech o.

Daivdson’s lone touchdown came in
the second quarter when Struppa’ fum-
bled one of Walker's punts-and the ball
was recovered by Black who went 25
vards for a touchdaewn, Gray kicked
goal,

Davidson held) Tech well until) the
third quarter. In this stage of the game
the weight of the “Tech team began to
tell. and short end runs, mixed with line
bucks, and some beautiful forward
passes. resulted ins two touchdowns and
the placing of the ball within: striking
distance of the goal posts, from which
pomt it was carried over a third time
soon after the fourth quarter had open-
ed. Phis ended the scoring for both
teams as the Red and Black took a brace
and held their opponents cll the end of
the game.

Most of ‘Tech's principal gains were
made on forward passes, which placed
the ball within reach af the Davidson
goal, Davidson tried only four passes
and only one of them was successful.
Roth teams made attempts at field goals
bat none of them were successful here
either,

For Davidson, the punting of C.
Walker, the tine plunging of | Laird,
Black and Keesler were the features.

For VTech, Spence's line bucking. end
runs by! Fielder and the — playing — of
Tohnstan and Senter were the — best
features,
nthe report of the game in the At-
lanta Constitution the following will be
of interest: “Davidson lived up to the
impression that they had created of hav-
ing a fast and well developed team. Al-
though outweighed many pounds to the
man, thev foughr the heavier Tacket
eleven gamely, only losing our in the sec-
ond half when their streneth -hegan to
ehh. Davidson started off with a rush
and gave Tech supporters some anvious
moments during the second half.

“The Davidson  binch impressed
everv one with their clean and) sports-
manlike manner of plaving, the men do-
ine the cleanest tackling seen on Grant
field in many seasons. Here's hoping
that their relations with Tech will con-
tinve in the future.”

The line ‘up of the teams was as fol-
lows:

Davidson. Position. Tech.
