Davidson Sends Five Men

Chalmers, Schenck, Richardson, Bitzer |

and Manze to Represent Da-
vidson in Student Vol-
unteer Convention

The Des Moines Student Volun-
teer Convention will be represented
by a full quota from Davidson Col-
lege. Three applications in addition
to the number allowed Davidson
have been sent, but it is doubtful
whether the reservations can be!
made. There will be in the neigh-
borhood of 6,000 delegates, from
every state, and the attendance is

only limited by the accommoda-; Mr, Arthur P. Newman Has Interest-

ers whose fame is national, make
the program one of unusual interest
and importance. It has been five
years since the last convention,
which was held in Kansas City, with |
an attendance of over 5,000. The
representatives from Davidson are
D. M. Chalmers, L. B. Schenck, R.
Bitzer, J. M. Richards and G. W.
Mauze. Several hundred dollars
have already been raised for their:
expenses, and Mr. Miles has asked
the student body to give what is
needed to make up the necessary
amount. The convention opens De-
cember 31 and lasts till January 4.

“WICKED MARQUIS”
PORTRAYS WELL THE
ENGLISH ARISTOCRAT

tions. Mott, Spier and other “Inake|

We all love to read books about |
lords, dukes, and marquises, and the.
ins and outs of an aristocracy al-,
most unknown to us. They have a
certain charm, a certain fascina-
tion. The tall and slim figure hold-
ing his monocle to his eye giving
some one pleasure by merely listen-
ing to his remarks is a figure almost
lost forever to the world except in
a few scattered exceptions. Such a}
\ man is the Wicked Marquis in the
book by the same name. Though he
is unfortunate in money matters, he
holds his head high and is the very
soul of a modern Beau Brummel.
Jt takes more than money to down
the head of an aristacrat of the old)
order. And then the love stories
which hinge around the old Mar-
quis. They are delightful! E. Phil-
lips Oppenheim has given us _an-
other good book. Read it. You
will like it.

Address Students
Friday Night

ing Message Concerning
British Empire

The next meeting of the Interna-

| tional Polity Club, to be held Friday

night in Shearer Chapel, will be one
of. unusual interest for at that time
Mr. Arthur P. Newton, of London
University, will speak on the gen-
eral subject: “The Organization and
Problem of the British Empire.”
Mr. Newton is a man of marked
ability and his power as a speaker is
one of his strong points. Mr. New-
ton is sent out by the central office
of the International Polity Club for
the purpose of giving the different
organizations in our country a het-
ter understanding of the affairs of
the largest empire in the world.
This is an opportunity to get a
-broad view of Britain as seen by a
Briton, which we do not often have.

The whole student body and peo-
ple of the town are invited to hear
this lecture. The local club urges
everyone who possibly can to 11-
tend. Arrangements will be made
so that the lecture will not conflict
with the movies and thus everyone
will have the opportunity to be pres-
ent.

The members of the club are tak-
ing more interest in the work than
ever before. The regular meetings
are well prepared, well carried out
and well attended. At a recent
meeting the club elected the follow-
ing men for membership: Profes-
sor Shewmake, A. L. Wilson, F. V.
Long, W. C. Neel, C. K. Brown, J.
C. McCaskill, A. G. Oltman, A. 5.
Foscue, C. E. McGirt, A. S. Currie,
R. E. McClure, P. C. Mauze and L.
H. Spence.

in every phase of the game, the red
jerseyed warriors of Davidson were
victorious over Furman by a score
of 41 to 14 in their Thanksgiving
game.

The game, which was played in
Greenville, was attended by nearly
4,000 spectators. Among these were
a large number of Davidson sup-
porters, in fact the red and black
seemed to predominate over the
blue and white. A large number “f
Clemson students were presnt to
root for Davidson.

The Wildcats played true to their
real form for the first time since
they met Washington and Lee.
Never since that time had Black and
Johnston been able to play through
a whole game together. one or both
being absent for a part or all «f
every game. The two backs cele-
brated their return to the game by
running through their opponents al-
most at will.

Black, plaving his last game for
the Wildcats, was easily the star of |
the whole contest. His line plung-.

Furman put up a hard fought
game all the way through, and suc-
ceeded in holding Davidson to a
14-14 tie until the middle of the
third quarter. The defense of the

Hornets crumbled before the fierce} -

charges of the Wildcats after that
tinle, however, and the result was
never again in doubt. Speer was the
outstanding star for Furman, mak-
ing most of their gains and getting
loose for the longest run of the
game when he sprinted around right
end for 42 yards and a touchdown
in the first quarter.

Davidson drew first blood in the
struggle. After receiving the initial
kick-off, she was unable to make
first down and Cassell punted to
Furman's 20-yard line. On the next
play Todd fumbled and Davidson
recovored. Two line plays and a
short end run by Johnston .were
enough to put the ball across the
goal line.

Furman evened the score in the
same period, when Speer made a
beautiful run around end for a

May 7.--Laurant, the magician.

Phe lycewn management has
finally arranged the dates for the
lyceum course, to be offered for the
post-holiday season. These. num-
hers are some of the strongest of-
fered by the Redpath Rureav.

The Collcens are a clever group
of young ladies wlio offer a musical
program that will be pleasing to all.

Opie Read, recognized as one of
America's moat. iHustriows humor-

vidson, fellows, and make it a per-
manent thing on the hill.

Watch The Davidsonian for cuts
and articles descriptive of these
splendid attractions.

ALL-CLASS BASKETBALL
’ TEAM PICKED -

Class basketball was unusually
fast and clean this year, and has
developed a number of good play-
ers, Indeed, an all-class team is
hard to pick because at times prac-
tically every player showed that he
had in him a goodly knowledge of
the game. The following would
perhaps be the best line-up and
could make any 'Varsity team work
overtime:
Right guard—S. D. Brice, '21. ,
Left guard—J. P. Price, ’22.
Center—W. W. Roberts, '22.
ism forward—T. W. Hawkins,
Left forward—M. R. Doubles, ’22.
Substitutes: Crawford, '23; Or-
mond, '21, Streibich, '22.
