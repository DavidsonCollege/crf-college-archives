THE DAVIDSONIAN

TIME FOR RELAXING

Be Students Again

“For 24 hours a_ student
again!” This is the slogan of
the Alumni College which the
college will sponsor here May
2 and 3.

The Alumni College will be
simply a two-day school con-
sisting of refresher courses in
‘| various fields and will be open
to a limited number of repre-
sentative alumni. These courses
will have two purposes: to give
a representative group of alum-
ni refresher experience in the
framework of education, and to
‘%,|give the alumni an inside look
#4) at the main business of the col-
‘| lege.
1| Approximately 80 minutes in
length. classes will consist of
:| discussions on recent develop-
.|ments in various professors’
‘| fields. Alumni will interpret de-
velopments in these fields in
the light of their own experi-
ence. Professors. will also pre-
sent material intended to mo-
-ttivate later reading by the
_ alumni.

*:| Friday evening there will be

cert. in the Union. After the
concert there will be an eve-
ning with the faculty, at which
time each alumnus will be able
to talk informally with small
groups of faculty members.

| Classes will be arranged so
that each alumnus will be. able
to attend three or four of these
“capsule courses.” Places will

which the Council has faced the
many crises this year, I would
say that it has done a magnifi-
cent job. The possible lack of
concrete action is overshadowed
by the way the Council has held
together and done ‘its job.

Q. What is the main problem
facing the new student adminis-
tration?

/
A. The gap existing between
the Student Council and Stu-
dent Body.

Q@. Whet do you propose to
do when you take office?

A. I have a number of plans.
First, of course, is the progres-
sion toward an Honor Council.
Second, a definite representa-
tion of each student on the
Student Council, perhaps alpha-
betically by classes. Along this
line, I hope to hold forums be-
tween the Council and the stu-
dent body. I think the Fresh-
man Council should be repre-
sented by non-voting members. :
And thirdly, I plan to: publicize
the actions and meetings of the
Council.

be left open in each of the
classes for seniors who wish to
participate.

This program will be similar
to other highly sucdéessful pro-
grams conducted in a_ small
number of colleges. The ad-
ministration hopes that the
Alumni College will become an
annual event here at Davidson.

Trask: Toward A

Better Davidson

By GERALD WILSON
Had the traveling fraternity cartoonist who so re-
cently visited our campus drawn a caricature’ of John
Trask, it would have been accurate only if it pictured
Trask, with his feet embedded solidly on an abstract
South. Carolina, his outstretched arm draped with a
Confederate flag, clutching tightly a sword labeled

“States Rights.”

John Trask is primarily a
man of strong convictions. And
whether one agreés or disagrees
with these convictions, he must
deal with them. No one ever
has a doubt as to where he
stands.

In his political thinking, John
is what he terms a “progres
sive conservative.” He favors
new ideas when they are com-
patable with the spirit of old
ones,

But he has not fallen into
the fallacy of letting his inter-
est in national issues cloud out
his concern for local problems.
Consistently, through the medi-
um of editorials he has fought
for a better Davidson. And this
better Davidson to him means
no further increase in enroll-
ment, maintaining the present
honor standards with a new
honor council, and a system of
preferential bidding.

Contrary to the perennial stu-

dent occupation of knocking the
College, Trask has been one of
Davidson's biggest boosters.

Trask is a businessman, and
he ran this paper like a well-
ordered business. He kept up
with everything concerning the
paper, and left. nothing to
chance.

Finally, John is a practical
man. He is, in the philosophical
sense, a pragmatist. If some-
thing works, then it is almost
certain to be good. He is not
interested in abstract theory,
but only in theory as it explains
the fact.

No editor of the DAVIDSON-
IAN ever gave more of himself
to the task. And when that task
was finished last month, Trask
had only a full notebook, and
an overloaded filing cabinet
with new redundent material

. and the knowledge of a
job well done.

Ciardi Presents
Liferary Awards

. The annual Vereen M. Bell
Memorial Award for Creative
Writing, a cash prize of $75.00
was awarded to Don Stowell, a
freshman, for his short story
“Teacup Terrace.” Ed Spivey
was named runner-up for his
satirical essay, “Femmish” (the
language of women).

The awards were presented
Thursday morning in chapel by
John Ciardi, Professor of Eng-
lish at Rutgers University and
Poetry Editor of “The Saturday
Review” who has gained a dis-
tinguished reputation as a poet
and critic. Before presenting the
Vereen Bell award he addressed
the student body on the subject
of creative writing and literary
criticism.

most interesting little man,
O. Dudgeon, assisting mili-

to Davidson in 1956, has as a
hobby making charts of all the
statistics in the Supply Room.

His latest chart, which con-
sists of the sizes, from top to
toe, of the seventy-three cadets
attending R.0.T.C. camp this
summer, shows that the David-
son Gentleman is a bit larger
than the average Army man.
The cap sizes range from 6%”
to 7%", with more wearing a
7%" size. Sergeant Dudgeon sly-
ly mentioned that the biggest
head, that of Lou Spears, is
58" larger than the Army av-
erage of 7%".

Shirt sizes range from
1752x34" to 14x30"—154%x34""
being the most popular. The
average trouser size is .34x33",
but the sizes range from 36x34”
to the 27x28” pair of Henry
Samuels.

J. O. Milner’s size 14B foot is
by far the largest in our group,
but Sergeant Dudgeon reported
that last summer at Fort Bragg
he had to order a size 1SEEE for
a cadet from Chapel Hill. The
smallest in our group, a 6A,
belongs to Henry Samuels.

While offering information
on his background, Sergeant
Dudgeon described himself as a
“Mountain Witliam!” Noting
the bewildered expression on
this reporter's face, he added,
“Just a high-classed Hillbilly
from Boone County, Kentucky,
a few miles from where the
large Mammoth skeleton was
found.”

On his desk he proudly dis-
plays pictures of his wife and
their eight-year-old daughter,
“a typical Army brat!” His
wife was born in Wales and had
spent four years in the British
service prior to their marriage.
Peering out. from” behind his
glasses and a screen of .pipe

smoke, Dudgeon chuckled, “She,

outranked me then! She out-
ranks me now! I don't stand a
chance.”

of delegation of authority. The
Cadet Regimental Staff gave the
team a briefing on this phase
of the operation.

The method of issuing wea-
pons for drills also received fa-
vorable comment. Apparently
many schools do not have as
effective a check on rifles is-
sued for weekly use and others
do not have as quick a system.

The inspectors spoke highly of
the caliber of students that they
met while on campus. They re-
ferred to the fact that this
spring a Davidson sophomore
made almost a maximum score
on the Army’s RQ-5 intelligence
test.

The two-day Federal Inspec-
tion was one of the most elab-
orate ever held on campus. In
addition to the normal extensive
checking of records and equip-
ment, the briefing, and the re-
viewing of the troops during a
parade, a reception was given
