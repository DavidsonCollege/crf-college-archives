Spencer Reveals Plan

For All-Girl College

Starting with next year’s en-
tering class Davidson will ac-
cept only women as the first
step in a move to make the
college founded by hearty
Scotch Presbyterians in 1873
completely female.

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr., with his
smiling wife Ava _ standing
beside him, made the an-
nouncement Thursday af-
ternoon to a stunned audience
of faculty and student bigwigs.
He said men would no longer
attend Davidson after this
year’s freshman class
graduates in 1977.

In explaining the decision
Director of Admissions H. Ed-
munds White said, ‘“The num-
ber applying this year is way
up, and it will be about the
hardest that it ever was to get
into Davidson.

“I was afraid that the
toughness of the competition
for places in next year’s fresh-
man class would lower the
number of applications in
following years, so I con-
vinced the administration and
the trustees that the only way
to avoid a fall in applications
was to refuse to accept men.”’

White laid the blame of ad-
missions being ‘‘way up’’ on
‘‘Davidson’s Christian
heritage which is irresistible
to the prospective student and
on student morale which is
higher than I have ever seen
it.”

Director of Student Housing
Mrs. Peter Nicholls (more af-
fectionately known as ‘‘Scotty
the Body’’) said another
reason for the phase-out of
male enrollment was that the
college could not afford to

build new dorms for a
previously projected student
body of 1500 by 1980.

‘We decided to stop kidding
ourselves,’’ said Nicholls,
‘“‘and keep the enrollment at
1000 by kicking out the boys.
They've had their chance for
136 years so it’s about time the
girls had one.

‘Besides the boys have been
nothing but a pain in the
proverbial ‘you-know-where’,
what with their building lofts
and forcing me to work at
least two hours a day when my
time could be used more
wisely.”

Strenuous objection to the
new plan was made by
Professor of Religion Samuel
(‘‘Shouting Sam’’) D. Maloney
who said, ‘“‘These old women
have complicated my pre-
ministerial program ever sin-
ce they got here.

“It's hard for them to be or-
dained and almost impossible
for them to find a_ pulpit.
Besides, although they can
type, they can’t fly a plane or
run a computer, the
prerequisites of being a
modern Renaissance Man.”’

Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan, known as one of higher
education’s leading _ in-
novators replied, ‘‘Oh my gosh
Sam! Don’t you realize that
all-women's colleges are the
coming thing? I want David-
son to be right in the forefront
of this movement; that’s
where the action is! ”’

Chiming in as is his habit,
Vice President for Finance
and Development C. David
Cornell said, ‘‘What this coun-
try needs is.a good $6000
finishing school, and we're
going to provide it."’

POOLING HIS RESOURCES
Deeply concerned over John Young’s excommunication,
coming coed locker rooms and dorms, and increased canine for-
nication, College President Samuel R. Spencer, Jr. is hard at
work in his office. ‘‘I always shoot out of the side of my mouth,”

Spencer said.

Davidson Confronts ‘Perverted’ Dogs

According to Director of
Physical Plant G. ‘‘Rover”
Mutz, Davidson College is
facing a dog problem for
which it has devised a biting
solution. Mutz claimed that
“those perverted Davidson
dogs”’ flaunt their sexual
prowess and perform illicit
and gross acts in public.

When asked what dogs he
was referring to, Mutz said,
“I’m not referring to the Watt
dogs or the Little dogs, but

dogs in general.”’

Mutz stated that a Davidson
Dog Patrol has_ been

established to pick up the of-
fending stray animals and end
the dog-eat-dog routine.

When asked his opinion of
the new measures, a member
of Mutz’s staff said candidly,
“Hell, I don't really mind it,
except when the black ones
and the white ones get it on
together. There are already
too many mulatos in the
world.”’

An interested professor who
chose to remain anonymous
added that open petting of
dogs has increased tremen-
dously in the past few months.
He postulated that the loose

morality of the dogs has taken
its toll on the students. ‘I’m
very firm in my belief of this,’’
he said.

When asked his opinion con-
cerning the problem, DAVID-
SONIAN Editor Alec Hoon
commented, ‘‘This dogshit has
got tostop.’’

Editor Hoon mentioned
several points. ‘‘For example,
with 29 dogs crapping twice a
day, that’s two tons at the end

of a year, geey!
“And even worse,’’ Hoon
said, ‘‘there’s no easy

solution. However, I’ve got the
answer.

Cornell Builds Case
For Wife's Trophies

Busy hammers were soun-
ding Monday as carpenters
put the final touches to David-
son’s newest trophy case.
Located on the first floor of
Chambers, the case will hold
prizes and awards for the
college debate team.

Vice-President for Finance
and Development C. David
Cornell, who ordered the case,
exclaimed, ‘‘Davidson has
needed things like this for a
long time.”’

“I told Sam,” he continued
“that if we were to keep up
Davidson needed trophy cases
and paved driveways. We now
have both.”’

Reaction across campus
was varied, however. Debate
Team coach, and wife of Cor-
nell, Jean (“‘The Machine’’)
Cornell said, ‘‘Don’t you just
love Dave's little ises?”’

Dean of Students Will
compared the case to ‘‘a piece
of crap,” commenting that
“Davidson just never seemed
to me to be the kind of place
that wears its medals on its
sleeve.”

Cornell disclosed plans to do
more work of this sort. ‘‘What
Ihave in mind,” he said, “is a
Wax’ musetim. Sort of a ‘down

memory lane approach to in-
terest our alumni.

“Just imagine the thrill,’’ he
said, ‘‘of seeing life-size full-
color figures of famous David-
sonians, Homer Smith, What-
a-Martha, Dean Rusk. The
possibilities are spectacular.”

Cornell’s staff was ap-
parently unaware of these
plans, however.
questioned about the wax-
museum, Don Winston asked
“‘What has that fat-head done
now?”’

Nancy Rhyne said, ‘I like
Mr. Cornell.”

While admitting that his
plan was probably a con-
troversial one, Cornell
claimed to be, “‘ready for heh-
heh, any debate that might
result. After all, I'm a master
debater.”

Faculty reaction to the Cor-
nell plans was favorable.
Professor of History Frontis
Johnston remarked, ‘I’m
pleased to see the Develop-
ment people acting con-
structively. For a long time 1

“T think we ought to put Cor-
nell in wax," another
remarked. _ oe

“Whenever a doggie craps
on the sidewalk, someone
rushes out with some hot
gravy train and pours it on the
turd. Another doggie in-
variably comes along and
gobbles it up. But obviously,
this involves a high degree of
recycling.”’

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. maintained
however, that his reward ap-
proach is preferable. ‘‘I would
hide a ticket to a Davidson ath-
tic event in some pile each
morning.

“The result is almost cer-
tain. Students, faculty, and ad-
ministration would come
together in this great search in
the shit.”’

The college development of-
fice is reportedly working on a
shit-stomping diamond-finder
attachment for the shoe.

According to Mutz, the Dog
Patrol will begin activity next
week, castrating any
unleashed canines. Professor
of Biology Donald Kimmel felt
that if the Patrol were to per-
form its dirty work in open
sessions, it would be an in-
valuable learning experience
for all in attendance.

“Beginning is the spring,
the Biology department will
offer extended studies credit
in introducing canine nut-
cutting

for Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan.

Mutz concluded by saying
that violating female dogs
would also be punished. Any
bitch picked up by the Dog Pa-
trol. will henceforth wear a
red “A” around its neck.
“That's the school color, you
know.”’
