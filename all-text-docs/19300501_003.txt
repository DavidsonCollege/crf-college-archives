THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 1, 1930

Pickups and Passes
By
W. H. Matthews

The outstanding sport event of the
week-end is the State track meet Satur-
dayday at Greensboro. Carolina stands
the outstanding favorite to run their
string of eight consecutive victories in
the annual affair to nine, and there seems
little chance of stopping them. They pack
enough power to win a large number of
the afternoon’s events and place in prac-
tically all. We look for Davidson to come
through with a second place again, and
State, Wake Forest, and Duke to finish
in the order named, Don’t hold it against
us if we miss it.

The Wildcats should win two places
in both hurdle events, with Whittle
certain to win both of them. The jave-
lin may produce a first, but it is not
likely. Following McCall’s nice work
last Saturday in the broad jump, he
rules a favorite to defeat Kinzey

. again. Boots Wilson has cleared five
feet, 8 inches this season, and that
height will come close to winning the
high jump, with the great dearth of
real jumpers in the state.

Charlie Farmer, Carolina’s ace Sopho-
more sprinter practically has the dashes
sewed up, and it is not likely that David-
son will enter either Whittle or Brohard
in those events. Brohard may win the 440,
but he will encounter much opposition from
State’s entry. Neither of the Wildcat run-
ners were able to place in the half-mile at
State two weeks ago, and there is little
chance of their doing so this time.

Lafferty has. not broken four minutes,
forty seconds in the mile this year, and it
will take better time than that to win the
event, we believe. If Soup Brannon is
pushed, he should be able to turn in a
better time than even his record-break-
ing mark against Wake Forest, and: it
seems certain that he will place.

The weakness in the shot put and dis-
cus precludes any possibility of amassing
any points in those events. Pat Boyle may
place in the shot, but no one on the team
has been able to hurl the discus far
enough to hold much chance there.

The performance of the track team as a
whole last Saturday against Wake Forest
was as good as any turned in this year.
The heavy wind made conditions anything
but favorable for record-breaking times
and distances. Nevertheless, three college
records were bettered, and Whittle set a
personal record of scoring more points in
one meet than at any previous time in
his college career.

With firsts in both dashes and both

Wildcats to Meet Elon
In Second Game Tues.

Lefty Briggs Will Go to Mound for
Christians

Rounding into the home stretch of the
present baseball season, the Wildcat slug-
gers who have won seven games and lost
six, have only five more scheduled to play,
two with Duke, one with Carolina, one
with the University of South Carolina, and
the other with Elon. All are to be played
at Davidson except the game with the Tar
Heels, and one of the Blue Devil encounters.

Davidson has experienced a fairly good

season, considering the fact that two of.

Coach Younger’s leading stars have been
out with injuries. Nab Armfield has not
seen service for the past three weeks and
has missed several games. However, he is
improving rapidly and is expected to play
the latter part of the schedule. Jim Proc-
tor, who has fully recovered, played in the
Carolina game last week.

Elon is bringing a powerful nine to play
at Davidson next Tuesday. The Christians
have been having a splendid season, led by
their pitching ace, Lefty Briggs. The port-
side hurler, -who is considered one of the
best in North Carolina, helped his mates
a few days ago to defeat Wake Forest, twice
the conquerors of Davidson. Clark and Har-
rington are a real threat with the bat, and
may prove a menace to the Wildcat hurl-
ers. The fact that Davidson has already
defeated Elon once this year—in a close
game, by no means makes the Wildcats an
overwhelming favorite.

Today Davidson is playing the conclud-
ing game of a series with Lenoir-Rhyne at
Hickory.

hurdles, Whittle ran up 20 points, to
better his mark of 19 made against
State last week. His times in the 100
yard dash, 10 seconds flat, and in the
highs, 15.3 seconds, were both excep-
tionally good. He also negotiated the
220 yard dash in 22.1 seconds, which
was also rather fast for the distance.

Joe McCall bettered his broad jump
record with a leap of 23 feet, 1-2 inch.
His mark beats the present state record
of 23 feet, 1-4 inch, held by Kinzey of
Wake Forest, buf the distance will not
stand as a new mark, unless made in the
state contest.

Brannon ran an exceptionally good two
mile, considering the bad wind, and turn-
ed in a new record of 10 minutes, 20.8
seconds. This breaks the old mark by al-
most five seconds. Coble got off a long
throw of 180 feet, 2 inches, in the javelin
to break the old record and to complete
the new records made for the day.

Pepper Wins State
Golf Championship

Defeats Willis of Carolina, Defend-
ing Champion, to Win

Captain Jack Pepper, versatile leader of
the Davidson College golf team, added an-
other honor to. Davidson's athletic laurels,

when he won the intercollegiate golf tour-
nament of North Carolina at Sedgefield last
Saturday. Winning medalist honors cinched
for him the individual collegiate champion-
ship of the State. His score was 160 for 36
holes, which was played against a very un-
favorable wind. Captain Pepper, who was
runner-up in the tournament a year ago, de-
feated Meade Willis, of Carolina, the de-
fending champion, who also hails from Win-
ston-Salem, and whose best score was 167.
Captain Pepper received a_ beautiful gold
medal.

In the morning round, Pepper led the en-
tire field, but was closely pressed by Cap-
tain Chatham of Carolina, who was only
one stroke behind. But, in the afternoon
battle, the Wildcat golfer shot 37 in the
first nine holes, and 45 in the next nine, to
win the meet.

On Friday, another match was _ collected
hy Carolina at Davidson's expense by a score
of 15-3. Captain Pepper furnished a high
spot in this encounter when he came from
behind, took a birdie two on the sixteenth
hole, par four on the seventeenth, and an
eagle three on the long par five eighteenth
hole to win the last nine holes against Cap-
tain Chatham of Carolina, Chatham, how-
ever, won the match.

That statement was on the first
package of Camels manufactured
and has been on every one of the
billions of Camel packages sold
from that day to this. When it was
first written, other cigarette man-
ufacturers were giving away flags,
pictures of actresses, pictures of
ball’ players—almost anything that
would make the smoker think he
was getting something extra for
his money. The makers of Camels
believed the smoker wanted a ciga-
rette sold strictly on its merits, with
all of its cost put into quality—a
cigarette made of such excellent
tobaccos—so perfectly blended—so
mellow—so fragrant—that it would

The vast popularity of Camels is
a tribute to that four-square policy.

THE WORDS on the back of the
package still mean what they say. No
“extras,” which do not contribute
to the quality of the smoke, are in-
cluded in the price of Camels. Just
