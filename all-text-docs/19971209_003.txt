College Relations

The other shoe has finally dropped.
It’s official. Dr. William R. Ferris, Jr.,
a 1964 Davidson graduate, is the new
chairman of the National Endowment
for the Humanities.

Since the announcement in late
July that Ferris was one of two finalists
for the NEH position, his fans at David-
son and throughout the world have ea-
gerly followed the story's development.
In late August, President Clinton con-
firmed that Ferris was his choice for the
nomination, setting in motion the pre-
liminary background checks that start
the confirmation process.

The founder.and director of the
Center for the Study of Southern Cul-
ture at the University of Mississippi,
Ferris has become internationally re-
nowned as a folklorist, anthropologist,
author, and blues musician.

Bill Ferris grew up ona farm near
Vicksburg, Miss., mesmerized by sto-
ries told by his grandfather and the
cotton pickers, banjo players and share
croppers in his rural setting.

While at Davidson, he majored in
English Literature and was honored with
the Thomas Wolfe Creative Writing
Award. After graduation, he received
an M.A.

In English Literature at Northwest-
ern ona Rotary Foundation Fellowship.
While on a one-year fellowship at Trin-

THE DAVIDSONIAN _

ity College in Ireland, however, he de-

‘ cided to go back to his first love and

switched his focus to folklore at the
University of Pennsylvania, where he
received his M.A. and Ph.D.

No one has ever accused Ferris of
being stuffy. Nor do many academics
consider his scholarly pursuits overly

cerebral.

None, however, can deny the cred-
ibility of his remarkable 27-page vita,
with his advanced degrees in English
Literature and Folklore, seven fellow-
ships, 67 major grants, and teaching
positions at Yale, Mississippi, and
Stanford.

He has been recognized with 14
prestigious awards, including knight-
hood in ]’Ordre des Arts et Lettres from
the French government, the Charles
Frankel Prize in the Humanities, and

-honorary doctorate from Rhodes Col-

lege, and Rolling Stone magazine’s “Top
Ten American Professors” list.

Just as the massive Encyclopedia
of Southern Culture, published in 1989
by Ferris and Charles Wilson, has been
termed a democratic merging of high-
brow and lowbrow topics, so too is
Ferris.

While his endless list of appear-
ances includes lectures at the most pres-
tigious institutions throughout the
United States and abroad, he also makes
regular appearances at local churches,
garden clubs, high schools, and Rotary

@ Ferris

Clubs.

He has wined and dined with the
richand famous across the globe, hosted
scholarly conferences to study the liter-
ary giants of this century, and clapped
and danced in smoky juke joints to Bo
Diddley’s jackhammer rock.

A preserver of legends and folk-
lore of all kinds, he himself is a legend
at Ole Miss, and among the many high-
brow and lowbrow audiences privileged
to have made his acquaintance.

In 1993, Ferris married Marcie

Davidson alum Ferris confirmed for NEH post

Cohen, a product of the South born in
Blytheville, Ark. The two first met
when she was an intern at the Center for
Southern Folklore in Memphis, Tenn.
Educated at Brown and William and
Mary, she directed the Museum of
Southern Jewish Experience in Utica,
Miss., and now is a partner in an Oxford
antique store.

While Ferris is no doubt an uncon-
ventional scholar and professor, his true
qualifiers for the NEH position are un-
disputed talents as an administrator,
fundraiser, and consensus builder.

Recent moves in Congress to slash
arts and humanities funding will re-
quire a skilled healer to find common
ground from which to inspire bipartisan
support.

Ferris believes the time is ripe to
gain back that support. Congress has
received a mandate from the American
people to continue to fund projects in
the arts and humanities.

The endowment critics have lev-
eled charges of inequitable distribution
of funding to elitists who are out of
touch with the American people.

Ferris sees the new millennium as
“a perfect opportunity-for the Ameri-
cans to look at their own cultural iden-
tity at the grassroots level,” he said.
“The NEH, working through state-based
partnerships, could help institutions
across the country develop dynamic
and imaginative agenda in the humani-

pete

ties,”

. Ferris has a deep respect and ap-
preciation for the endowment and is
excited about the opportunity to pro-
mote its merits.

“The NEH supports education and
scholarship at every level in our nation,
which is clearly a bipartisan issue,” he
said. “As education becomes more
specialized, we must make deliberate
efforts to enable both public and private
institutions to provide programs in the
arts and humanities; seeds must be
planted in our local communities that
will foster creative vision in our future
leaders.”

Ferris points out that the most suc-
cessful people in the corporate. world
are those broadly educated in the liberal
arts, who bring imagination and cre-
ativity to their decisions.

“Top CEOs like Robert Pittman,
head of America Online, and Ervin
Duggan, Davidson Class of “61, who
heads public television, have renais-
sance minds that often go against the
grain in discovering new perspectives,”
Ferris said. “Some critics feel we can’t
afford to keep spending substantial
amounts for programs in the arts and
humanities.

“My viewpoint is that we cannot
afford to stop supporting these efforts
to preserve our identity as a nation or let
our children lose touch with their heri-
tage.”

Patterson Court Judicial
Board sanctions PiKA, KA

By SARAH OGDEN
News Editor

Kappa Alpha and Pi Kappa Alpha
(KA and PiKA, respectively) are both
currently being sanctioned for violating
“portions of the Patterson Court or Col-
lege policies for organizations,” accord-
ing to Jean Boehmler, Sergeant-at-Arms
of the Patterson Court Judicial Board.

KA was charged on Oct. 22 with
serving minors and over-serving an in-
dividual (who was taken to the hospi-
tal), which violates both N.C. State law
and the Davidson College alcohol
policy.

They were also charged with fail-
ing to register the Oct. 16 party during
which these events occurred.

The party, said KA president Carlo
Reynolds, was a “celebration of the first
round of bids’ being given out.

This is the house’s first offense of
the year.

At KA’s hearing on Oct. 29, the
Patterson Court J Board agreed to sanc-
tion the house. It was decided that KA’s

functions must be alcohol-free until Feb...

28, and that after Feb. 28, KA may only

-have “BYO” functions for the rest of
spring semester. The house is prohib-
ited from sponsoring parties - on or off
campus - with alcohol until Feb. 28.

KA must also hold educational
programs dealing with alcohol, two of
which have already taken place, and
one of which is planned for next semes-
ter before the end of Feb. For the third
program, Reynolds said that he plans to
have an expert speak on the dangers of
excessive alcohol consumption.

The house must pay a $100 fee
“for appearing before: the Judicial
Board,” as well.

“We definitely were inthe wrong,”
said Reynolds, who went on to say that
the house did try to “ameliorate the
situation’” by turning themselves in and
cooperating with the College. The J
Board findings agreed, saying that KA’s
“response to the situation should serve
as a model for other houses. The sanc-
tions reflect your appropriate move to

take (the student) to the hospital, your
efforts to be honest about what hap-

pened, and your active measures to -

ameliorate the situation.”

Reynolds said that he thought the
sanctions KA faces are appropriate, and
that ultimately this will be a good expe-
rience for the house in terms of reduc-
ing liability. “It made us question what
we stand for,” said Reynolds. “There
are other ways to have fun' besides get-
ting drunk.”

Reynolds expects the experience
to bring the house together, and thinks

, the sanctions will be good for KA’s

pledges, who will begin their member-
ships ina dry house and hopefully learn
to drink in moderation.

Reynolds stressed that the hospi-
talized student “took full responsibil-
ity” for the extremely drunken state,
and that there was no pressure for the
student to consume alcohol at any point.

“(Providing minors with alcohol)
is a very risky thing to do, as well as an
illegal thing to do,” said Reynolds, who
feels. that KA’s sanctions will act as an

“eye-opener for the whole Court.”

PiKA has been charged with vio-
lations three times this year, with the
outcome of the third case still requiring
the approval of Dean of Students Fom
Shandley. The case will not be consid-
ered public until Shandley approves the
J Board’s decision.

PiKA was charged on Oct. 31 with
its first violation of the year for lacking
‘TDers at the front door to check for
PCC Stickers and Davidson ID” and for
“improper Risk Manager behavior”
during the Oct. 24 Glam Rock party.
The Risk Manager on duty at Glam
Rock was not wearing the required red

polo shirt. PiKA was also charged with:

“handing beers over the railing at the
stairs to underage drinkers.”

The house was found guilty of the
first two charges and not guilty of the
third after pleading no contest at the
Nov. 11 hearing.

Though handing beers over the -

railing is a violation of the College
alcohol policy, PiKA was found not

guilty of the third charge, said Boehmler,
because there was no police officer on
duty at the party, which was an “ugly
situation.” The house, however, should
have taken responsibility for its own
function, she continued.

PiKA president John Hawk said
that it was difficult to control the party
in the police officer’s absence because
people wouldn’t listen without a widely
accepted authority figure present.

The sanctions PiKA was given are
a $150 fine and a mandatory “thirty
minute review session of the Davidson
College alcohol policy” with the mem-
bers of the house to discuss the “‘what
ifs’ of a party situation in terms of risk
management.”

Hawk said that a risk management
workshop was planned for Dec. 7 to
“make sure glitches are ironed out.”

PiKA was charged again on Nov.
18, this time for failing to register a
Nov. 12 party and for “permitting per-
sons less than 21 years of age to possess
alcoholic beverages” through an ab-
sence of Risk Managers.

The Patterson Court J Board heard
PiKA’s second case at the same Nov.
11 hearing where the first case against
the house was heard.

The Board agreed to fine PiKA
$100 and to put the house on probation
for 14 days, beginning Nov. 24 and not
including Thanksgiving Break. PiKA
must pay a $200 fee, as well, for appear-
ing before the J Board.

“T think we were treated fairly,”
said Hawk. “We know that (the viola-
tions) won’t happen again.”

Hawk expects the sanctions to
“raise general awareness around cam-
pus that we need to straighten up and get
our acts together,” but does not expect
the sanctions to affect PiKA’s pledge
class.

Phi Delta Theta (Phi Delt) also has
a Patterson Court Judicial Board case
pending.

Dean of Students Tom Shandley
declined to comment on the cases;
Patterson Court Advisor Jim Barber
was unavailable for comment.~

Are you having trouble getting a
start on that psychology paper? Do
you need help putting the final touches

ing Center can help you.

The Center, which is located in
the basement of North Chambers near
the Psychol-
ogy depart-
ment, is
available to
students
Sunday-
Thursday
from 2-4
p.m. and 8-
11 p.m.

Ac -
cording to
David
Santschi, a
senior his-
tory major who works at the Center as
a tutor, the purpose of the Writing

development, from English 101 to
Seminar papers and theses.

The Writing Center is normally
headed by English professor Shireen

Carroll, who is on leave for the year.
Visiting English professor Tim
Waples is presently substituting.

A total of six tutors work at the
Center, including Santschi. They are
all seniors, said Santschi, and most of
them major in subjects other than En-
glish.

Other tutors at the Center are
psychology major Susannah Herndon,
biology majors Erin Mooney and
Rhonda Rowell, English major
Lorraine Eaddie, and history major
Jackie Rasulo.

The tutors are paid, continued
Santschi, except for Herndon, who is
working at the Writing Center as part
of an independent study.

Tutoring at the Center, however,
is nota work-study job, and therefore,
funding does not come from the Of-
fice of Financial Aid, but rather from
the English department.

The average number of students
who utilize the Center every week is
between 25 and 30, according to.
Santschi.

The past few weeks have been
much busier, however, with many stu-
dents working on end-of-thesemester
papers.

Overall, “business has picked up
50 percent this semester,” according
to Santschi.
