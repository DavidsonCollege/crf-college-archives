TALES, from page 3

whom I have met only hours pre-
viously ‘in a rail station in Oos-
tende, Belgium, while fifty
drunks stare at us and spéak to us
in slurred foreign languages.

In Oostende, I met Chet who
had ona Duke sweatshirt and said
he was going to Frankfurt. Since I
wasn’t sure where to go, I tagged
along. When we arrived in Frank-
furt late at night we frantically
searched for food since we both
were starving. We found
Wendy’s open and met a U.S.
Army guy who told us that bums
spend the night there all the time,
so that’s what we did, too. Two
very drunk and crazy men, who
were also fluent in several lan-
guages, talked to us all night.

For hours the one named Mat-
thew told us over and over again
about good women, a fight he’d
been in, how much the Danish
drink, that the night wasn’t good
for me, and that we'd be asleep in
10-25 minutes. Oh what a night!
My parents would be horrified.

20 Sept. 1988. Here I am in
Queen Elizabeth Hall at King’s
College with all the other Beaver
College study abroad students! In
some ways it’s nice to be getting
started with my program, but I
really sort of miss my freedom
and independence and the flexi-
bility of my recent unstructured
European holiday (as the English
would say).

3 Oct. 1988. My final destina-
tion--YORK! The campus land-
scaping is beautiful with plush
grass and lots of trees plus a lake
with ducks and geese. BUT this is
undoubtably some of the ugliest
architecture I have ever seen in
my life!! 60’s style. Unpacking
was weird--only two suitcases
and a backpack to unpack and no
music. I’m gonna have to get a
radio or I simply won’t survive.
~ 13 Oct. 1988. The British wash-
ing machines load from the side
like dryers and only fill the bot-
tom portion with water, thus only
some of the clothes are immersed
at a time. Strange.

7 Nov. 1988. BROCCOLI!!!

Oh, it was wonderful to have
broccoli again. I’m dying for
green, leafy vegetables. (I had
gone into a Chinese restaurant in
York with a friend. We gave the
waitress the order ‘““Whatever you
have with broccoli in it.” The
British diet is not exactly bal-
anced, and in fact when you are
referred to as a “healthy Ameri-
can,” you are not expected to
regard it as a compliment.

12 Nov. 1988. Grassington,
The Yorkshire Dales. (This is the
placé James Herriott writes
about.) We embarked on a hike in
the countryside. Beautiful. Gor-
geous. Magnificent. Peaceful.
Green. Sheep. Cows. Hills. Trees.
-Waterfall into a stream. Acres and
acres of land. Miles and miles of
uncemented stone walls dividing
fields. We walked for hours on
footpaths through mud and stones
and sheep and a graveyard. We
went into an old church through a
gate which instructed you to close
and lock it back after you to keep
the sheep out!

13 Nov. 1988. There was a
BLUE SKY today!! It felt like
North Carolina with that clear
blue sky. I’m not homesick at all
though. I want to stay here for the
whole year so badly! I really do.
I’ve even thought of what I would
have to go through to stay the rest
of the year. BUT--I can’t. It’s as
simple as that. I cannot stay the
whole year. The reasons why I’m
here for only one term won’t go
away. Somehow all the reasons
seem painfully inadequate right
now when my heartand soul have
become attached to Yorkshire, to
friends I’m making here, to Eng-
land. -

17 Nov. 1988. I’m back in the
big city again--LONDON. /t
hasn’t changed much since I was
here two months ago, but I have.
This time I feel like a University
of York student coming to Lon-
don for the weekend, not like an
American coming to Europe fora
term.

18 Nov. 1988. Lunch was one
of our more memorable experi-
ences of the day. I got a “chicken
salad” sandwich which is more
accurately described as cartilage,

suffering from rigor mortis per-
haps. Pretty bad, but it made fora
good joke for the rest of the day.
(Note: When in London, do not

‘eat at cheap restaurants.)

19 Nov. 1988. We survived.
What did we survive? Oxford
Street at 5:00 p.m. on a Saturday
during Christmas shopping sea-
son after several hours of strug-
gling through Harrod’s with half
of Britain and a few other coun-
tries. Kim and I hit every floor in
Harrod’s. We conquered! We
only bought sweets. Kim and I
agree _ that
we're glad
we come to-
gether--nei-
ther of us has
gotten upset
the numer-
ous times
we’ve had to
turn around
and retrace
our steps be-
cause we
went the
wrong way.
We should
be map-read-
ing experts by now. I hate to think
how many times we’ve stopped,
pulled out the map, asked our-
selves, “are we going the right
way?” -”well, where are we?”

When we got the tube (subway)
to King’s Cross Station, we found
swarms of bobbies. with German
Shepherds. It looked like they
were preparing for a big drug bust.
Weasked a bobby about what was
going on. Two of them very
kindly and courteously (true to
their reputation) explained that
they were there to control the
football (soccer) hooligans. They
do this after EVERY football
game and there. are 11 soccer:
teams in London!

24 Nov. 1988. Well, this was
probably: the only Thanksgiving
I’ll ever spend sitting in a lecture.
We Americans thought of
Thanksgiving songs after class.
There was a handmade Happy
Thanksgiving card for me under
my door. It immediately made me
smile and I figured one of the
Americans had done Thanksgiv-
ing cards for everyone. Well,
even better than that--the card
was from my corridor mates-- ~-
British friends who knew that is
was an American holiday.

28 Nov. 1988. 1 went into York
alone today--I walked in. I really
was observant of little details. I
noticed the moulding on flat (as in
house) doors, how the houses are
all lined up without yards be-
tween them, all the Socialist
Worker posters with big bold let-
ters proclaiming “Margaret
Thatcher Murders 14 People” or

Junior Jerrilyn Wood
the Yorkshire Dales.

something similar. I paid more
attention to the street signs, Brit-
ish cars, all the bakeries and pubs
and Fish & Chips shops. All the
medieval remnants around York-
-the big gold and blue and green
clocks, emblems, the city wall,
statues, the MINSTER--Ah!, the
bookies, The Nut Centre,

Tesco’s, Marks & Spencer’s,
C&A, bus stops, etc. I could go on
forever talking about all the triv-
ial things that make York York ,
and Yorkshire Yorkshire and how
I’ll treasure these little details and

WHEN I returm, I will feel at
home because of them.

The Minster is the huge, fa-
mous Gothic Cathedral located in
York which contains the world’s
largest stained-glass. window
(which is the size of a tennis
court). It is the primary’ tourist
attraction of York and is truly
awe-inspiring. The Nut Centre -
C&A are all store names of stores
I frequented.

7 Dec. 1988. My corridor gave
a dinner party with me as guest of
honour tonight! Alistair and Anna
cooked a tender turkey, carrots,
potatoes (of course), brussel
sprouts, and plum pudding with
brandy sauce or custard for des-
sert. We had wine. Smart dress for
everyone. I got tears in my eyes
when I saw all they’d done for me-
-candlelight, farewell sign, deli-
cious food and great company!
I’m going to miss this lot SO
MUCH! (Note: Smart dress
means roughly semi-formal or
dressed up at least. The word ‘lot’
is used in this way frequently by
Brits, and by this point I was
sounding quite a bit like them.)

9 Dec. 1988. Last day at the
University of York. Everybody
left me today. The hall is com-
pletely dead tonight. It’s probably
better for me this way. I need this
time alone at the end to unwind,
pack, think, cry, be quiet, remem-
ber, think ahead, listen to music,
accept that this is it--it’s over--
I’m leaving. I miss them (friends
here) already. |

Lalmost finished packing and at
7a.m. have decided to sleep for an

KING, from page 3

“Why aren’t there more whites
here? King’s desire for a nonvio-
lent social change pertains to
everyone. I think it’s clear he has
had an incredible influence on ~
both blacks and whites. But why
wasn’t this celebrated by both?”
Graver added, however, that
she was heartened by the response
that she did get this year. “Hope-
fully,” she said, “there will be
more participation next year.”

Monday, January 16, was a day
tinged with irony. On the very day
that people marched to honor a
champion of nonviolence, race
riots broke out in Miami, leading
to 3 deaths, 400 arrests and 25
cases of arson. _ %

Montgomery maintains her
belief that, despite rampant vio-
lence in the world, a peaceful
solution to problems can be
reached. “Nonviolence is pos-
sible. Loving people is hard to do,
but in the long run it gets you

. farther.”

hour. Packing means leaving and
that’s tough--especially this time.
Ouch.

13 Dec. 1988. Edinburgh, Scot-
land. The Scottish really do have
their own accent--very sing-
songy. They seem a proud people
too. Very proud of their heritage.
SCOTLAND! I’m glad I made it
here even though I’m only getting
to see Edinburgh and only for a
few days. Definitely worth it.

14 Dec. 1988. Train from Ed-
inburgh through York to London.
I got a seat near the door as usual
and an Aussie sat across
from me. The Aussie was
really cool.. We have the
same birthday! Can you
believe that? 06 May. I‘
flipped. He didn’t believe
me, so I produced ID prov-
ing it. I really enjoyed talk-
ing to him.

The people I’ve
met on these trains! ! Great
conversations, but this one
may have topped them all.
I could’ve easily talked to
this bloke for hours with-
out boredom. He told me
about Australia--heat, wet
season, no unemployment, tons of
empty and some unexplored land.
Crocodile Dundee definitely a
stereotype--no one carries those
knives. Found out that British
drivers’ licenses are good once
you have them for YEARS and
YEARS unless you’re in an acci-
dent or something. No picture on
them either,

17 Dec. 1988. Wurzburg, West
Germany. It’s great to be with
Sarah again. It will be strange not
rooming with her at. Davidson
next term. We have talked and
talked about our study abroad ex-
periences till the wee hours of the
morning since I arrived. I have
just realized that I will probably
feel culture shock when I return to
the States in a few days. How
strange! I prepared to acclimate to
a foreign culture when I came
over in August, but I never really
thought about the fact that return-
ing to the U.S. could be strange,
but I fear it will be. Oh, well. I
adjusted once; I can adjust again.
I need to lose this mutt accent I’ve
developed though. I keep being
called Dutch, Swedish, or British
everywhere I go. I’m sure I’1l lose
it soon enough once I’m back on
home turf.

I still wish Icould stay, butIam
looking forward to seeing every-
one at home and at Davidson and
getting back into the swing of
things. I’ll have to learn how to
study again. This has been aca-
demic vacation compared to
Davidson. I knew the British sys-
tem was different--now I know
how. They don’t work. The Brit-
ish culture is mush more relaxed
in some ways, yet they take them-
selves more seriously than we
Americans do in others.

‘One thing is for sure--there’s
absolutely no substitute for living
in another culture. It’s an experi-
ence that simply cannot be gotten
any other way. I have learned so
much in such a relatively small

‘span of time. This is an experi-

ence which has permanently
changed me--made me open-.
minded about things I formerly
couldn’t be open-minded about
because I didn’t even know they
existed.
