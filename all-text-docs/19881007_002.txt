Shuttle

On Monday, at 12:37 p.m.
EDT the spaceship Discovery
and its 5 man crew safely touched
down on 7.5 mile runway at
Edwards Air Force Base in Cali-
fornia, ending the long awaited
return of NASA’s space shuttle
program.

On Thursday morning, 32 two
months after the Challenger dis-
aster and on the exact same
launch pad, the Discovery blasted
off from Cape Canaveral, Florida
at 11:37 a.m. Except for the late
departure, approximately an hour
and a half behind the scheduled
9:59 a.m. liftoff, the space shuttle
went through its flight error-free.

The flight, which cost an esti-
mated 1.6 million dollars, is the

: first in a line that will hopefully
reestablish the credibility of
NASA and the United States
space program. The next shuttle
flight, that‘of the spaceship Atlan-
tis, is targeted for November 17,
at which time a secret Defense
Department payload will be car-
ried into orbit.

Handguns

On Monday, a gunman opened
fire on elementary school chil-
dren in Mascotte, Florida. Mon-
day’s incident was the third of
its kindAfter last week’s hor-
rible shooting spree in Green-
wood, South Carolina and simi-
lar episode last year ina suburb
of Chicago,

An unidentified gunman,
dressed in fatigues, fired three
shots at an outside gym class,
seriously injuring one girl, before
quickly disappearing into the sur-
rounding woods. Despite an ex-
haustive search by the police,
both in the air and on the ground,
the gunman still remains at large.

In another incident involving
firearms, syndicated columnist
Carl Rowans was facing charges
of illegal possession of a hand-
gun, had his case declared a mis-

trial after the jury became dead-
locked at 9-3 in favor of acquittal.
A status hearing has been reset for
October 13. .

Drugs

In what has been termed by
some as “Thinking the Unthink-
able,” a hearing on the legaliza-
tion of illicit drugs was last week
held before the House Select
Committee on Narcotics. This
radical approach to our nation’s
growing drug problem, led by

Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke,

came to national attention last
April after Schmoke first pre-
sented this as a realistic:solution
to the drug problem.

Mayor Schmoke, a Rhodes
Scholar and former prosecutor
who convicted thousands of drug
offenders, said that our nation’s
current “war on drugs” is inef-
fective. He suggested that we
move towards decriminalization
of controlled substances, allow-
ing the war on drugs to be waged
by “the surgeon general, not the
attorney general.”

Politics

The League of Women Voters
has withdrawn their name as the
sponsor of the secorid presidential
debate between Michael Dukakis
and George Bush. League Presi-
dent, Nancy Neuman, said that

the League did not want to be
associated with debates in which
both candidates avoided taking
definite positions on controver-
sial subjects or tackling any hard
issues.

In his biggest test since the dis-
closure of his enrollment in the
Indiana National Guard, G:O.P
nominee Dan Quayle faced
Democratic nominee Lloyd
Bentsen in a debate of the two

vice-presidential hopefuls
Wednesday night.
On the traditional first Monday

of October, the Supreme Court

reopened its doors for a new ses-
sion with a court that has a more
conservative tilt than the last one.
This has generated some appre-
hension in the legal community as
many decisions that protect an
individual’s civil liberties may be
reinterpreted or perhaps over-

. turned by the new Court.

However, in one ‘of its first
moves, the Court refused to re-
lease North Carolina officials
from their obligation to provide
lawyers for inmates who need
help with legal documents. The
Court decided ‘that the state
should continue to shoulder this
responsibility and rejected the
N.C. appeal without comment.

Shakeup at the Kremlin

By BETH DRUMMOND and
CAROL GATEWOOD
MOSCOW: Dominating
headlines in the world news this
week was Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev’s major realignment
of the Communist Party. On Fri-
day, the Party Central Committee
dismissed three veteran members
and accepted. the retirement of

titular president Andre Gromyko

Communi:

from the ruling Politburo.

Other senior officials such as
No. 2 party leader Yegor Li-
gachev, found themselves signifi-
cantly stripped of party influence.
This radical move allowed Gor-
bachev to consolidate his leader-
ship of the Soviet Union by taking
over the presidency, making him-
self both head of state and chief of
the Communist Party.

Gorbachev has already an-
nounced plans to increase the
power of the presidency, as part of
a policy of making the govern-
ment function more independ-,
ently of the party. There is wide-
spread speculation over why Gor-
bachev moved so quickly to carry.
out the reorganization plan called
for in a ial meeting of the

-skeptical about Pino-
Party last June, but

there is little doubt that he
achieved an important break-
through in the consolidation of his
power as leader of the Soviet
Union.

SANTIAGO: There were many
public demonstrations in Chile
last week both for and against the
re-election of military President
Augusto Pinochet. Tens of thou-
sands of Pinochet supporters

step down if he is defeated. Pino-
chet has controlled Chile since a
military backed coup in 1973
ousted the leftist government of
Salvador Allende.
