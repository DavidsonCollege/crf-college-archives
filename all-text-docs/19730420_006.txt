The Davidsonian

Public Interest Group Solicits
To Mobilize Student Concern

By BRUCE MALOY
Managing Editor

‘We are trying to remedy the
shortcomings which student in-
terest groups have suffered
from in the past. working
mainly in three areas: con-
sumer protection, en-
vironmental preservation, and
corporate responsibility."

This is how Wayne James of
the North Carolina Public In-
terest Research Group (N.C.
PIRG) explained the purpose of
his organization in a meeting
Tuesday afternoon.

A question and answer sheet
put out by N.C. PIRG describes
the organization as ‘‘...a group
of scientists. lawyers. social
and other professionals working
full-time under the guidance of
a student representative body
to present citizen causes before
the courts. the legislatures. and
the public.”

Davidson students Mike
Ernst and Andy Lamas are
now trying to get a chapter of
N.C. PIRG started at Davidson

During the next week they
and other interested students
will canvas the campus seeking
signatures authorizing the ad-
ministration to include three
dollars annually in students’ bill
fees which will be turned over to
N.C. PIRG

James explained that each
time the money is collected
“students may have their
money refunded on request for
a period of about a week ©

This past Tuesday the N.C.
PIRG supporters went before
the SGA Senate to seek its ap-
proval and support

Ernst stated that on Monday
April 30 an Open End will be
held in the college Union to ex-
plain the purpose and activities
of N.C. PIRG to students and to
answer any question that they
might have.

If the PIRG chapter is
established a board of six to
nine students will be elected by
the student body to coordinate
the campus activities of PIRG.

This board will select one
member to be a representative
to the state board. which is the
governing body of PIRG.

‘| have talked to Dr. Kincaid
about students working with
PIRG as their Extended
Studies." said Lamas. ‘and he
approved of the idea

“At Duke.” continued Lamas.
“courses have been added to
the curriculum which give
credit for public interest work.
but here I expect that that most
of the work will be done as Ex-
tended Studies.”

Students at other schools
doing public interest research
have studied race and sex
discrimination. grocery store
pricing. landlord tenant
relations. advertising prac-
tices. occupational safety. en-
vironmental education. and
have lobbied in Raleigh for con-
sumer and environmental
oriented proposals

James went on to explain the
sort of projects which PIRG has

pursued in the past. “We ran a
food price survey in Durham,
comparing the prices at about
15 stores and also comparing
the national brands to the
‘store's own’ brand.

We did this by making a com-
puter printout list available to
housewives and asking them to
price certain specified products
for us while they did their
regular shopping. We took the
results of this survey and sent
it to the newspapers in Dur-
ham,” explained James.

‘We found that the cost of
enough food for a family of four
for one week could range from
$35.70 to $45. depending on
where it was bought.”

When Ralph Nader was in
Chapel Hill last fall he
suggested setting up a North
Carolina PIRG along the lines
of the groups which have
already been set up in 14 other
states

Presently. there is just one
Xerox duplicating machine
available for student use. Each
individual reprint made by this
machine in the library costs ten
cents. which is a rather stan-
dard charge for such copies

The faculty and_— ad-
ministration have access to a
separate machine in_ the
basement of Chambers which
operates at a cost of tive cents

Stephenson also announced
that. as a result of an expressed
student interest. he had= con

about’ the ‘‘possibility — of
lowering the per-copy price to

He said that he is “‘op-
tumistic’ that such a_ price

the volume of copies would

Hollins Offers Educational Experience

By VIC FLEMING
GUEST COLUMNIST

A: Hello. out there in Wildcat land
Roger Muck here. vour roving reporter.
reporting today from the campus of
Hollins Counce. that famous liberal
arts institution where ch people send
their daughters to learn ladincSs and to
find husbands.

8: Fina nusbands” A thousand girls
at a school in the mountains of Virginia.
find hushands?

A: Excuse me, Eric Neverside. Most
of them are here perhaps to let hus-
bands find them. Or something like
that. At any rate. for many years. Hol-
lins was an all-female institution

But in recent years. male students
have sprung up from nowhere. so it
seems, through graduate programs and
an exchange program called the Eight
College Consortium. Yet still. the
ratio remains fairly disproportionate.
about 30 to one.

B: And today we are going to in-
vestigate some of the aspects of such an
environment, aren't we, Roger?

A: We certainly are, Eric. We are
going to venture into the abode of the 14
undergraduate male exchange stu-
dents. By the way, they are from near-
by schools which are primarily all-

_male: Hampden-Sydney College, Wash-
ingicn and Lee. University and David-
son College, the iasi oi these to which
we are sending today’s broadcast.

This is it, Eric, Boxwood, a large
white house on a hill situated directly
across Highway 11 from the Hollins
campus. Before last year Boxwood was
the home of the family of John Wheeler.
dean of the college.

Boxwood underwent a thorough
renovation and now is made up of 14
bedrooms, five baths, a kitchen and a
livingroom.

B: Don't just stand there on the front
porch, Roger. Goon in.

A: (What if they have girls in there? )

Okay. Eric. I'm going in now Ah. yes.
here in the living room we have several
bovs and girls

Eric. they re all sitting up like
mature human beings. There are girls
here and there isn't even any BLEEP!
going on. I'd better ask about this.) Ex-
cuse me, sir. What is your name?

C: Isaac

A: Mr. Isaac. sir. what is it like to be
a mc2le at Hollins College?

C: Oh. 10S Feally no different from
being a male anywic’e else.

A: You mean the gis/S dont
just—Well, never mind. Thank you. Mr.
Isaac.

B: (Goover tothe guy with the red
hair and the moustache. Roger. )

A: (Okay.) Excuse me. sir. What is
your name?

D: La Rosa. I'm Italian.

A: Yes, certainly, Mr. LaRosa
Would you elaborate briefly on your
Hollins College experience?

D: Wow, man, it’s really been great
I've had a really good time.

E: Excuse us, Mr. Muck. Would you
let us say a few serious words to the
people out in Wildcat land?

A: Why, sure. What are your names?

F: Never mind what our names are.
People all over Wildcat land are gonna
see this broadcast, and we want to
prevent any false impressions if
possible.

A: (They're going io spoil the show,
Eric. What do I do?)

B: (Let them talk.)

A: Okay, goaticad, gentlemen.

F: Many people, so it seems, 27@ un-
der the delusion that every male who
cames to. Hollins just naturally
majors for a year in sexual acrobatics
and minors in birth control. And it is
important that this delusion not become
the prime attraction for prospective ex-
change students.

A: (Gulp!) What then?

F: I would hope that a different
educational experience would somehow

enter into the mind of the prospective
student

E: Yes. whether it be purely tor the
courses available or tor having temales
as Classmates as well as dates. the
educational experience should figure in
highly

Take me. tor instance For 14 vears
I've gone to all male schools. And now.
by experiencing the other extreme in an
academic atmosphere. I feel I might
somehow be better prepared for the
happy medium which they say awaits
us in the outside world

F: Exactly, and my advice to the guy
who 1s .20king at Hollins as one nine-

tue. ee “
month sex orgy is Forget it!” The

orgies are few and far between
_A: And what ts this that you men-
tioned about courses?

E: Hollins has a number of courses
that I could not get at Davidson. I'm
very interested in Russian studies, and
Davidson is nil in that area.

Here at Hollins. however. there are
courses offered in the Russian
language, Russian history, Russian
literature, Russian philosophy and
Russian politics. ,

F: And Hollins has fine graduate
programs in English, which is my
major, and in psychology. Of course un-
dergraduate students are allowed to
take the graduate level courses.

I have taken three graduate level
courses in English and have been very
favorably impressed. Most of my
English professors here, also, are
published authors with at least a fair
degree of regional brominence.

A: Is Hollins more difficult

Davidson, or less so?

than

E: Well, that is a hard question to an-
swer. I've done considerable more
work here than at Davidson and my
grades have reflected it. :

F: Same here. It all depends on the

. « » J
individual coufse and the professor

And also ot course the amount ot effort
one is going to put out) Some people
here are able to do tar less work and
still make better grades. Education
remains, In My opinion, what the in-
dividual makes it

A> Well. what about your social life?

KE 1 think the major change involved
there is being able to know the opposite
sex ona basis other than that of a date

F: Plus the fact. that the person who
suffered socially before is not likely to
make a radical change just because the
girls are suddenly closer. The at-
mospnere Might, probably does, cause
an individual to change a ne.

But one has to change in many ways
just to be able to cx'st in an atmosphere
like this.

A: What do you mean?

F: There are so many names and
faces to remember. And there is also
the temptation (I won't deny this) to try
and turn Hollins into something it is
not: a brothel of loose women. And lam
afraid that that would be the best way

for a Buy to insure that he never had
any social life at all.

E: There's also the fact that knowing
girls in the classroom for the first time
can be quite a shock. It takes a while to
Bet used to knowing that everytime you
open your mouth in class what you say
is subject to challenge by 20 members
of the opposite sex. .

A: Gentlemen, we are running out of
ume. Can you say a few words to sum
things up

E: No

F: No

A: What dol donow. Eric?

B: Hell if [know
