West Virginia Senator
Continues Great Issues

Jennings Randolph, Democratic sena
ednesday as part of the YMCA’

assembly

Johnson anti-poverty bill, Ran-
dotph will speak on current fed-
eral programs that seek to aid

Trustees
Meet Here
On Friday

The first bi-annual meet-|:

ing of the Davidson College
Board of Trustees will be
held here next Friday. This

will be the first year that],

the Trustees have met in
October. Previously the
two meetings of the Trus-
tees have been held in Feb-
ruary and May.

Robert Stone, assistant to the
president, gave two reasons for
the change in meeting times.
First, the February meeting
was always much longer than
the May meeting, there being
nine months of business to dis-
cuss in February, and only two
months of business to consider
in May. With the change in
meeting times, business should
be handled more efficiently
and in a much less burdensome
manner.

HERE FOR HOMECOMING

The second reason for the
meeting change is to enable
the trustees to be at Davidson
for Homecoming weekend. With
the former schedule of meetings.
many trustees were unable to be
on hand for the various alumni
activities of that weekend.

The change to a fall meeting,
with the second meeting in May,
will be permanent. Before the
meeting of the full board in
October, the Executive Commit-
tee consisting of 15 members
elected annually to act in the
absence of the full board, will
hold a meeting. ;

Stone also said that the exact
topics for discussion are not yet
certain, since the trustee re-
ports have yet to be formulated
and printed. This information
will be available early next
week.

Faculty Favors Johnson

Vote Result Clashes

With Student Opinion

A majority of 88.2 percent of the faculty supported

President

yndon B. Johnson in a faculty poll conducted

this week by THE DAVIDSONIAN. In the faculty of 61
Democrats, eight Republicans and seven Independent
voters, Johnson attracted 67 votes. His opponent, Sen.

Barry Goldwater,
Both in its opinion and in the
strength of that opinion, the fac-
ulty differed from a recent .de-
cision of the Davidson student
body. In a student poll held
two weeks ago, Goldwater won
by a margin of 24 votes, with
702 students voting. This gave
him $1.0 percent of the votes.

Johnson derived his strength
in the faculty poll from the
members of his own party, al-
though he sacrificed some of
that strength to the Republican
side of the ticket.

Sixty-one members of the fac-
ulty declared themselves Dem-
ocrats, and 54 of them voted
for Johnson. Seven teach in the
natural sciences, 20 in the hu-
manities and fine arts, 14 in
history and social sciences, and
13 are members of the admin-
istration.

voters placed themselves in

support of Johnson.

Two faculty members refused
to make a choice between the
two candidates. One balloter in-
volved in the natural sciences
declared, ‘‘The prospect of eith-
er scares me." An Independent
voter said, “I would prefer
someone else.”
tive of the humanities wrote,
“Johnson is less dangerous.
The way Goldwater shoots from
the mouth scares me." And a
fourth voter deposited his shop-
ping list, without comment.

Ballots for the poll were dis-
tributed through the faculty
boxes in the Alumni Office.
Where faculty members shared
a pigeonhole, a suitable number
of ballots was deposited. Some

The other seven DemocratSmembers of the administration

voted for Goldwater. This “back-
lash" vote (Democrats voting
for Goldwater) among the fac-
ulty saw a corresponding ‘‘front-
lash” created by the six Repub-
licans who voted for’ Johnson.
The remaining two Republicans
voted for Goldwater.

Council Will Support
Store For Used Books

By JOHN BAILEV
Davidsonian Steff Writer
The Student Council met Tues-

day night and decided to work

for the establishment of a used-
book store that would be super-
vised in conjunction with the
existing book store in the Stud-
ent Union.

Sophomore Representative
John Gresham reported that he
had spoken with Peter Nicholls,
manager of the book store-stud-
ent store, who seemed very
agreeable to the idea of reselling
used books. The new facilities
in the Union have made addition-
al space available, by selling
the used books on a 5 per cent
commission basis, Gresham con-
tends, the cost of the extra time
and personnel involved could be
defrayed. It is hoped that per-
haps this plan can be effected
by the beginning of second sem-
ester of this school year.

Student President Will Jack-

son was able to provide this
definition of gambling in answer
to questions from council mem-
bers. (The definition comes
from the minutes of the Student
Council meeting on November
15, 1961.): ‘Gambling is defined
as an organized game of skill
or chance, the main purpose of
which is the accumulation of
money. and in which more than
two people are involved.”

Jackson reminded the council
that the Wildcat Handbook edi-
tor's election will be held within
the next two weeks. He asked
that anyone interested in run-
ning for the editorship contact

mediately.

man Court Chairman John Bar-
row, reported that 40 freshmen
had been tried and subjected to
useful work projects around the
campus.

Drive Aims
For $4.50
A Student

The YMCA began its annual
fund drive yesterday with the
hope of amassing $4,475 to fi-
nance the extensive program
planned for this year. The cam-
paign, which will attempt to col-
lect $4.50 from each student,
will end next Thursday.

This year’s program, explain-
ed in a pamphlet by Buck Law-
rimore, features the Great Is-
sues Lecture Series; the Forum
Series, theme of which
is “Sex and Ethics;’’ and the
Book of the Year program.

Three thousand dollars has
been allotted for the Great Is-
sues and Forum series; the es-
timated expense for the Book of
the Year is $400.

In addition to these major ex.
penditures, the YMCA will carry
out its usual work in commun-
ity aid, tutorial work, deputa-

tions, and spiritual life.

Revision and expansion of the Reserve Officer
Training Corps (ROTC) program cleared both houses
shortly before Congress adjourned last week. The

action cleared the bill for the President's signature,
which is expected at any time.

Included in the bill is a pay raise for advanced
ROTC cadets from $27 to $40 per month.

cept a commission.

Set up by the act of Congress is a program of

one-to-four-year scholarships for students in Air

Force, Navy and Army R

C units. (A plan current-

ly established for students in Navy ROTC units was

abolished.)

Students who entered the program would be

A representa-|

In addition to expansion of the junior ROTC
program in the high schools, the bill authorizes the
establishment of two-year courses of advanced train-
ing in military sciences for the Army, Navy and Air
Force.

In order to be eligible for two-year course, stu-
dents first would be required to attend a six-to-eight
week summer training program, which would stand
in lieu of the first two years of basic senior ROTC
training. The two year courses could exist side-by-
side with standard four-year senior ROTC courses
at the same institution.

The pay raise to students in the advanced senior
ROTC programs applies to either the new two-year
programs or the last two years of the existing four-
year programs. .

While the pay raise is fixed at $40, the Depart-
ment of Defense is granted discretionary authority
to set the pay rate as high as $50 per month. How-
ever, Department spokesmen told a Senate com-
mittee during the summer that a raise beyond $40
was unlikely in the immediate future.

The bill also makes students in an advanced
ROTC course liable to call for two years of active

required to commit themselves to a minimum of
four years active-duty service. The scholarship would
entail payment of tuition, books, laboratory and
other fees, plus a monthly pay of $50 during the
school year. The estimated figure for tuition and
other costs was $800 to $850 per student and the
estimated cost of pay was $500 per student.

Enrollment in the scholarship program is limit-
ed: Army and Air Force, until four years after final
approval, 4,000. Thereafter the figure will be 5,500.
The Navy’s limit will be set at 5,500 beginning on
Sept. 1, 1965.

Summer pay is also affected by the le islation:
The bill set the monthly pay for senior ROTC stu-
dents taking summer training programs at $111.15,
while the monthly pay for students taking a summer
program to qualify for the two-year, advanced senior
ROTC program was set at $78. Travel allowance for
eligible students was increased from five cents to
six cents per mile.

Also authorized is a $300 uniform allowance
for ROTC graduates commissioned as regular or re-
serve officers. (The allowance is currently being paid
only to officers receiving a reserve commission)

REORGANIZED EFFORTS

Rival Political Groups
Campaign In Earnest

With the presidential election
less than a month away. the
two rival political camps on the
Davidson campus — the Young
Democrats Club and the Young
Republicans Club were busily
engaged in organizations and
campaigning during the past
week.

Last Friday during chapel
period’ the Young Democrats
Club held a brief organizational
meeting. Sam Grimes, last
year’s YDC president, served
as chairman of this meeting.

Approximately 40 past or po-
tential YDC members were pres-
ent. Grimes stated the club’s
solid endorsement of the John-
son-Humphrey ticket, and also
announced that the club will sup-
port Dan K. Moore’s candidacy
for Governor of North Carolina.
Grimes did admit, however, the
club is more a Preyer-Sanford
oriented group. A meeting time
of 8 p.m. Monday. was set for
the first official meeting.

At the Monday night meeting.
Grimes, from Washington, N.
C., was re-elected president for
the coming year. Derek Lindsey
was elected vice-president, with
Gary Martin re-elected as secre-
tary and Arnie Snider elected
as treasurer. Committees to

handle programs, projects, pub-
licity and polls were selected.

PROJECTS ON TAP

After a reading of the club's
constitution, several projects
were approved by the members.
A drive to remind citizens to
register and to vote will be
launched in the Davidson area.
Also, a drive to encourage Dav-
idson students from out of state
to acquire absentee ballots and
vote will be. undertaken by the
members.

On the other side of the poli-
tical fence the Republicans were
busy showing their enthusiasm
for getting out the vote. Their
meeting held Wednesday at 7
p.m. was open “‘for all those
who believe in the Republican
principle that government should
do for the people what they
cannot do for themselves."

The election of officers for
the coming school year was held
at the Wednesday meeting, and
Preston St. Clair, from Indiana-
polis, Ind., was elected presi-
dent. Elected to assist him were
Larry Noah, vice-president:
Harry McMullen, corresponding
secretary: Walter Edgar, re-
cording secretary: and Joe
Obenshain, treasurer.

Approximately 30 Young
Republicans were present for
the meeting. The club’s consti-
tution was submitted for ap-
proval; a vote will be taken at
the group's next meeting. Com-
mittees were appointed to han-
dle membership, ‘programs, pub-
licity, platforms, and the cur-
rent campaign.

A report on the state Young
Republican Convention held in
Durham last weekend was given
by St. Clair, who attended with
member Joe Beard. Several.
resolutions were passed at this
gathering, one being to urge all
college student councils to with-
draw from NSA. Another reso-
lution applauded Strom Thur-
mond for his ‘political brav-
ery’ and welcomed him to the
GOP. A plan to sell GOPeanut
Crunch was discussed at the
convention.

The Young Republicans have
attempted to place a Republican
chairman on each halt in the
dorms, and hope to encourage
all Goldwater supporters to
work for his election. The club
also plans to work in coopera-
tion with thé Republican Head-
quarters in Charlotte.

Poet And Critic Van Doren

Makes Quiet Impression

By TED GLUSMAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

He was no blaze of educat-
ed fire, no lion of literature,
but rather a quiet man, with
a soft voice and a way of
saying exactly what he
meant. He spent one day
at Davidson, reading poetry,
commenting on it, and leav-
ing those who heard him
with a feeling of having had
a heart-to-heart talk with a
wise old gentleman. He was
the year's first Reynolds
lecturer, Mark Van Doren.

Dr. Van Doren spoke first to
students in Hodson Hall Monday
evening. His introduction by
President D. Grier Martin in-

the student body, choosing
as his topic “Love Poems,”
but commenting that almost any
poem could be considered a
love poem: His readings on this
occasion consisted mainly of
samples from a series of son-
nets and a series of what he
called “Dunce Poems.’’ Student
reaction was particularly good
toward the latter, which Van
Doren described as’ poems writ-
ten without thought.”’ “‘It’s nice
sometimes,’ he scid, “to talk
without thinking.”

Again Van Doren was not phil-
osophical. but sourlded almost
as if he were having an inform-

cluded an impressive list of ac- °
complishments, most notably a |

Pulitzer Prize in poetry. As he

stood to speak; with his shock ~ ,

of white hair, and his kind
smile, the audience was inevit-
ably reminded of Robert Frost.
Later, as Van Doren read some
of his own poems, the compari-
son was again made by many
of his listeners,

The awe with which many
greeted him, however, was
quickly replaced by a warm
friendship between audience
and speaker, as Van Doren told
his audience that he was not
going to lecture, because he had
“run out of things to say.”

Instead, he chose as his topic |-

‘Animals,’ and spent the rest
of his time reading and com-
menting on poems about them.
He was never deeply philosophi-
cal, but always entertaining and
always interesting. In fact, he
presented some unique views
about animals. One that stuck
in the minds of most was that

ticated animals,” the cat and -*

the dog are truly civilized, for
they live in our houses with us:
the other animals are the real
domesticated ones.

Though Dr. Van Doren is prob-
ably better known as a literary
critic than as a puet, (his The
Poetry of John Dryden is con-
sidered the best book on Dry-
den's poetry, and his criticisms
of Shakespeare and Hawthorne
rank among the best), he avoid-
ed criticism entirely during his
stay here, preferring instead to
stick to his own poetry.

al chat with the student body.
The students, in return, were
surprised and pleased by this
informal, yet fascinating. style
of presentation.

When he finished, the ap-
plause was quiet, and rather
solemn. There was no obvious
enthusiasm, no cheering. The
thing to do was to applaud for
a moment, then go home and
think. Go home and remember
the joy this man received from
even the simplest things in life.
Remember how he was able to
share this joy with a thousand
individuals. It was, to say the
least, an impressive perform-
ance.
