Davidson's 1984 Cats
are continuing to rack
up the “firsts” in Da-
vidson grid history and
can make a major gain
on past records if they
can turn out a win ov-
er Elon tomorrow. Last
™ Saturday night, the
m Wildcats edged Wof-
ford’s Terriers, keep-
ing up with Davidson's
never-lose- to- Wofford
policy. In a series of
# seventeen games, Wof-
ford has managed one
~‘tie that is the lone

mark against an other-
wise perfect record. It was the first time this season that a
Terrier opponent had stopped the scoring punch of the South
Carolina crew, and that in itself was an accomplishment.
Though the Davidson team drove within the Wofford 20 yard-
line on several occasions, the lack of scoring punch forced the
Cats to pull out the win on the toe of Bob Talbert. It was the
first time in history that Davidson has won a football game by
a field goal, and Coach Dole couldn’t have chosen a more ap-
propriate time to try one. Of the five times that Davidson had
the ball within the 20, there were three times that Cat players
fumbled the ball, and Wofford recovered each time, once on
the one yard-line. How much does it take to make a coach
tear out his fast-graying hair?

Wildcats Meet lon In Season Finale

Asheratt Paces Cats’
Fourth Place Finish

BY LEON HOWELL

In the Southern Conference Cross Country meet in Lex-
ington, Virginia, last Saturday, VMI, participating on their
home course, turned in an easy victory. With a winning score
of 27, they finished ahead of W&L with 71, West Virginia with

71 and Davidson with 94 in that order.

'

with the best season’s record since 1907. The 1926 Davidson] ©

team which won the State Championship had a record of sev-
en wins, two defeats, and one tie, and if the Cats win the Elon

battle, they will surpass that mark with a record of seven wins],
and two losses. The 1907 club won five, lost none, and tied].

one, setting the all-time record for Davidson clubs.

For the second time this season, the Cats have the oppor-
tunity to become the first Davidson team since 1926 to win
four straight contests. After winning the first three games this
year, the Cats muffed the chance when Presbyterian pulled a
10-7 upset. After losing to Furman, Davidson got back on the
winning track and has now won three straight again. It may
take quite an effort to get that fourth, however, since Elon is
no push-over. The Wildcats remain a three-touchdown favor-
ite and will have an added incentive since the parents of
many players will be sitting in the stands as part of the Parent
Day program.

The Fighting Christians will be out to give Davidson its

first licking in a long series, and this year’s team will be one|
of the best Elon has ever thrown at the Cats. Last week Elon|&
beat Lenoir-Rhyne by the same one-touchdown margin that ||

Wofford beat the Bears. They'll be rough!
The ’54 Cats go into their last game with an impressive

list of statistics which include three wins in which their op-| aca

ponents ‘were held scoreless (V.M.I, Citadel, and Wofford).
The Cats have averaged 19.2 points per game and have held
opponents to a 7.7 average. On five occasions, the Davidson
club has scored in the double figures, with the 53-6 rout of
West Virginia marking the high point of the year.

SENIORS TO DON PADS FOR LAST TIME

Though the next issue of The Davidsonian will have a
feature on the seniors on this year’s football squad, we still
feel the need of saying a word about the boys who are playing
their last football game for Davidson tomorrow. There are
eight seniors on the team, and their absence next year will
indeed be felt. Corky King and Charlie Rankin are Wildcat
ends who will be graduating, and Harry Peterson is the lone
graduate in the tackle position. Dickie Davis, Captain of the

The next issue of The Davidson-

oring the seniors on the 1954 foot-

last game of the season tomorrow
against Elon, and a_ post-season
tribute will be well-deserved. The

season since the war, and certain-
ly they have played a tremendous
part in that performance.

BOB TALBERT

As the whooping and hollering died away at Spartanburg

last Saturday night, Davidson fans were singing the praises
of Dickie Davis and Bob Talbert, the key men in the series
of plays which brought Davidson’s only score against the

Terriers.

In the second quarter of a score-
less contest, Davis scooped up a
Wofford fumble on the Wofford
26 yard-line after Wofford had
stopped a Davidson drive and was
starting to roll. It seemed that the
little guard's effort might have
been in vain as the Cats moved to
the Wofford 7 yard-line but stalled
there.

With fourth down coming up,
Talbert came into the contest to
attempt a field goal. The try was
to be from the Wofford 15 at a
slight angle, and Talbert Booted
the ball through the uprights for
the only score of the night. It was
the first time this season that Da-
vidson had attempted a field goal,
and Coach Bill Dole’s strategy paid
off.

Davis, Captain of the ‘84 Cats,
played his best game of the cur-
rent season and was the sparkplug

;of the Davidson defense. From his

linebacker’s post, Dickie recover-
ed two Wofford fumbles, inter-
cepted one Terrier pass, and was
a demon at stopping the running
game of the highly-rated South
Carolina crew.

Talbert has received his share
of notice this season since he is
the first Davidson player in quite
a while who has been able to kick
the points-after in consistant
fashion, but Saturday night’s per-
formance put him in the spot-
light.

Playing before a hometown
crowd in Spartanburg, Bob made
the first field goal attempt of his
life. Though he had been kick-
ing extra points since his high
school days and had practiced
field goals, this was the first time
he had been put to the test in a
game.

Davidson Edges Wofford
In Real Thriller, 3-0

PULLIAM

Davidson College, famous for its scholars, came up with

an “educated toe” last Saturday night and won their sixth
game of the season as they downed the Wofford Terriers, 3-0.
Tronically enough, the boy with the educated toe, Bob Tal-
bert, is from Spartanburg, home of the Terriers. Dickie Da-
vis, senior Cat guard, recovered a Wofford fumble with less
than six minutes remaining in the second quarter, and with
only four minutes left in the first half, the winning goal was

kicked.
Davidson and Wofford gained al-
most the same amount of yardage
on the ground, although bristling
line play for both teams far out-
shadowed the usual, hard running
attacks of both clubs. The Cats had
a large edge on the passing side
of the ledger, completing eight of
nineteen for 129 yards, while Wof-
ford completed only three of four-
teen for 59 yards.
The Terriers had a first quarter
touchdown play called back be-
cause of an off-side penalty, and
never again were they able to pen-
etrate deep into Davidson. terri-
tory.
Wofford entered the game as a
slight favorite, but with the excep-
tion of the first-quarter surge
which carried to the Davidson four
yard-line, the Terriers were kept
in their own territory most of the
time by the charging Wildcats.
The Cats, driving deep into Wof-
ford territory time after time, lack-
ed that punch necessary to score
as they were hurled back by the
powerful Terrier line or fumbled

Information Given
For Greek Meets

Coach Pete Whittle has released
advance information concerning
the annual Inter-fraternity swim-
ming and wrestling meets which
will be held just following Thanks-
giving holidays.

The Inter-fraternity swimming
meet will come first on the docket,
being scheduled at present for No-
vember 30 and December 1. There
will be eight events in the meet,
beginning with the 25-yard free-
style and ending with the 150-yard
medley relay. Other events which
will be held in the meet are: the
50-yard free-style, 75-yard free-
style, 50-yard backstroke, 50-yard
breaststroke, 75-yard individual
medley, and 200-yard relay. There

the ball away.

Typical of line play by both
teams was the fact that Joe Hazle
and B. B. Stevens, Terrier half-
backs who had run rampant over
all previous foes, were held to less
than 50 yards net rushing by the
Cats.

Trying to pick an individual star
is sometimes difficult and when
the Cat line did so well, everyone
is to be congratulated. Dickie Da-
vis and Harold Davis played excep-
tiona}ly well, and Harold stopped
Lawrence on that first Wofford
scrimmage play which went almost
all the way. Henry Brown and Don
McKee moved the ball well for the
Cats. McRee, one of the fastest
runners in the Davidson backfield,
almost broke away on one occa-
sion, but was tripped just as it ap-
peared that he might go all the
way.

The Wofford-Davidson series be-
gan in 1904, and with the excep-
tion of a 7-7 tie in 1948, Davidson
has won every game (the record is
16 wins and one tie).

Saturday's contest marked the
first time this season that Wofford
had been held scoreless. The Cita-
del, only team to whip the Terriers
prior to the Davidson game, could
only take a 14-13 win over the
Gold and Black.

“LIVING IT UP”
Dean Martin - Jerry Lewis

Dole worked his boys hard this

. | week in preparation for the battle.

He is taking no chances on this
game and even drilled the squad
in ‘Tuesday’s rainstorm. The team
is in good shape and will be at full
strength for the contest.

Elon has a 5-1 conference record
and has clinched second place in
the North State Conference. The

| Christians proved to have a strong

defense by holding bigger and
more experienced Eastern Caro-
lina, last year’s North State Cham-
pians, to only 85 yards rushing and
iby intercepting five passes. The
Christians also outplayed the Cita-
del but lost the game when the
Bulldogs scored two quick touch-
downs in the final three minutes.
Elon beat ‘Lenoir-Rhyne by the
same six-point margin that Wof-
ford did, and the Christians ran up
a greater score against Catawba
than did Davidson.

Elon saw a rather poor season
last year, when they had to rely
heavily on the untried sophomore
and freshmen members of the
team, but’ now these men have
gained experience and have play-
ed some excellent football.

Coach Varney, with sixteen let-
termen, will be able to field a
complete team of monogram-wear-
ers. At the ends for the Fighting
Christians will be Chuck Michaux,
who for two years has served as a
back, and Captain J. C. Disher. Al-
though the tackle position was
weak last year, it is strong now
with six husky 200-pounders from
which to choose, Coach Varney
gave the starting assignments to
Bob Kopko and Ed Davidson. At
guards will be lettermen Chuck
Maynard and Glenn Varney, a
younger brother of the Elon coach.
Homer Hobgood, a light but fight-
ing junior, will hold down the cen-
ter spot. In the backfield, Bill
Snyder and Jerry Akromas will al-
ternate at the quarterback posi-

tion. Bob Stauffenberg will be the
fullback, and Whitney Brodham
and Paul Watts will be the half-
backs. Break-away runner Kerry
Richards will also add speed to
the Elon backfield.

In the fifteen years of competi-
tion, the Christians have been able
to score only two points against
Davidson, and the ‘Cats are favor
ed to win this one. Elon, however,
has one of the best teams that
they have fielded in many years.
