Tar Heel Presbyterians State Union of Student Seniors Reveal Su

Expect War Battle
rom Palmetto
Brethren

Both Teams Defeated Carolina by One

Touchdown—Wildcats in Bet-
ter Trim Than Usual

The Wildcats will play their sec-
ond and last game on the Hill next
Friday afternoon, when Sprunt
Field will be the scene df a battle
royal between them and the foot-
ball warriors from the Presby-
terian College of South Carolina.

The South Carolinians have an

unusually strong team this year

and have made an enviable record
for themselves in their home state.
They succeeded in defeating the
University of. South Carolina by a
single touchdown, which was also
the margin of Davidson’s victory
over the Game Cocks.

In a more recent game they suc-
ceeded in flinging a seare into the
ranks of Clemson supporters, hold-
ing the Tigers to a 19 to G score on
the latter’s home ground. The
Presbyterians have perfected the

forward passing game to a high de- |

gree and used it with great success
in this game. In fact they came
much nearer defeating their op-
ponents than the score would indi-
cate.

The Wildcats will probably enter
the fray in better condition than
they were in for the game with the
University of North Carolina. They
emerged from that conflict without
sustaining any serious injuries and
if Jack Black is able to be in i
game on Friday, they should be in
fine trim for that day’s struggle.
At any rate they will be right there
with the old pep and,whatever the
lineup, will show the South Caro-

lina Presbyterians what Davidson's |

fighting spirit is.

No line-up of the Presbyterian
College is available. The Wildcats
will probably line up as follows:

L. E., Davis; L. T., Hammett;
L. G., Romefelt; C., Brady; R. G.,
Lafar: R. T., McMaster; R. -E.,
Douglas; Q. B., Spann; R. H. B.,
Johnston; L. H. B., Black; F. B.,
’ McFadden.

Polity Club Gets Going—-L. P.

Good Chosen President

Other Officers Elected—New Mem-

bers to be Taken in Soon

Armistice day was marked in plans for this conference will please |

many ways. Not the least of these
was a meeting of the International

Polity Club of Davidson. New offi-
cers were elected and plans laid for
aggressive work. During the S. A.
T. C. period last year the work of
the club was not pushed as vigor-
ously as in former years. The offi-
cers elected on Tuesday plan to
again have some interesting and
worthwhile meetings.

The International Polity Club at
Davidson is one of many such clubs
in the leading colleges. These clubs
are established for the purpose of
discussion of relations between the
nations of the world, and of ways
of promoting peace. Books are
supplied from a fund set aside by
Andrew Carnegie for the American
Association for International Con-
ciliation. Some of the speakers are
also paid from this fund. Professor
Newton, of the University of Lon-

| Volunteers Accepts
Davidson’s Invitation

|
Annual Conference to be Held Here
the Middle of March—Many
Delegates of the Fair
Sex Expected

In response to an invitation is-
‘sued some two wecks ago by the
| Volunteer Band in behalf of the
student body, the following letter
has been, received:

North Carolina College,
Greensboro, N. C..
Nov. 10, 1919.

My Dear Mr. McClure:

I take the greatest of pleasure in
accepting the cordial invitation ex-
tended to the Student Voluntcers
to meet at your college next spring.

If it is necessary to settle the day
now, let us say the second week in
; March. .
| May I say further that in accept-
‘ing the invitation | shall expect a
large number of the students to

.tegister for the conference just as |

if they were going away to an-
other college.

1 wish to thank you for the per-
sonal interest vou have shown and
‘the Student Volunteer Band atso.

Please express my. appreciation
to the student body for making the
invitation possible. 1
that we are all looking forward to

our visit with you with a great deal

of pleasure.

Again thanking you, ] remain
Most sincerely yours,

| (Signed) Janie Klutz.

Miss Klutz is president of the
‘State Union and a live wire in the
,cause of Student Volunteers. In
‘accepting this invitation she con-
fers a great honor on Davidson and
‘in accepting the honor Davidson
pledges herself to live up to and
beyond her reputation to the best
fof her ability.

Of course such a conference will
mean much to our college. Aside
from the fact that delegates will
be coming from all over the state,
there will be worth-while speakers
who in themselves will be an in-
spiration to all. In the neighbor-
‘hood of 125 delegates are expected,
about one-half of whom will be
ladies. This fact is enough to make
‘every true Davidsonian stand be-
‘hind all efforts to make the event a
“success,

Plans are already in the minds of
.several regarding ways and means
ito properly entertain the confer-
‘ence. New features will be worked
,out and announced in due time. The
request now is that every fellow
who has a suggestion regarding the

hand same in writing to some
:member of the Volunteer Band.
These will be appreciated and care-
i fully considered.

Davidson having one of the larg-
est bands in the state, being the
| logical center from which to reach
the colleges in western North Caro-
lina, and being easily reached by
;rail from practically all other col-
leges, makes it the logical place for
next spring’s conference. Every
. student should be behind this move-
ment. Let’s make them say that
“the 1920 conference at Davidson
was the best yet!”

don, is expected to address the Da-
vidson Club in December.

New officers are: L. P. Good,
j president ; J. P. Taylor, vice-presi-
dent; M. A. Siske, secretary. An
election of new members will be
held soon.

Senior Speaking Subjects.

The subjects which have been
chosen by the seniors for the an-
nual speeches show a digression
from past predominant thoughts of
war and bolshevism, and tend ‘rath-
er toward the problems of our own
country. They range all the way
from “Ye Grande Old Days” to “in-
finity,” and Dr. Currie said that
they showed more of a tendency
toward original thought than to-.
ward abstracts of articles gotten
from the library. In regard to the
standard of speeches presented to
him this year, he said that though
he had read comparatively a few
-of those to be given, yet he found
‘NO poor ones, quite a majority be- |
ing fair and medium, and two or.
three being of very excellent com- ’
position. ;

marks, while the plucky losers,
stuck by the team to the finish and
had no excuses to offer for the de-
feat.

To pick out the individual stars
would be a hard proposition. Lowe
and Spann both ran their respective
teams in great style, taking every_
advantage. Spaugh was the most
consistent ground gainer for Caro-
lina, while Johnny Johnson bore
the brunt of the Davidson attack.

First Half.

Carolina received the kick and
returned the ball to her own 40-
yard line. On an exchange of puits
and a few successful line plunges,
Lowe finally got in a position to at-
tempt a field goal. This he accom-
plished after eight minutes of play.
Carolina 3, Davidson 0.

The ball see-sawed up and down
mid-field during the remainder of
the. first quarter. By a successful

Johnson, half back,

Carolina made a wonderful. de-
fense in breaking up the Davidson
aerial attack. Not only did the Blue
and White warriors break these
passes up, but frequently they in-

ball yards before being downed.
During the first half Carolina used
line plays almost exclusively. Her
off-tackle plays always netted sub-
stantial gains until the Red and
Black goal line was in eminent dan-
ger and then she was held for
downs. Very few passes were at-
tempted by Carolina.

Davidson relied on end runs alto-
gether during’ the first quarter.
However, in the latter part of the
second quarter, Spann began to
hammer on the line. This proved
to be Carolina’s weak point for sev-
eral times Johnson penetrated the
foremost defense on guard and
tackle plays. Davidson launched
