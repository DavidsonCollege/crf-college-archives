e

Brown examines Code

By BRUCE BROWN
SGA PRESIDENT

When the 1976 Davidson
College Constitution was for-
mulated, some matters of policy
were left deliberately unspeci-
fied. No specific procedures
were established for hiring and
firing, promotion, and awarding
of tenure to faculty members.
The recently released Code of
Faculty Evaluation represents
the first step in formulating
these procedures. Before this
document reaches its final form
it will be debated by the faculty
and approved by the Trustees.
It should also be considered and
evaluated by the students. The
importance of these procedures
hardly needs to be emphasized,
especially in the light of the
Linden and Devon “‘affairs.’’

This article seeks to provoke
discussion of two critical as-
pects of the document which
involve the welfare of the ‘col-
lege community: the students’
role in the evaluation procedure
and the college’s continuing
Christian commitment as out-
lined in the Statement of Pur-
pose.

The six general points of
faculty evaluation set forth in
the Code include “‘(1) mastery of
the field taught, (2) excellence
in curriculum design, (3) skill in
communicating knowledge and
in motivating students to learn,
(4) personal concern for stu-
dents, (5) the capacity to exem-
plify by personal witness the
intellectual and moral values for
which the college stands, and
(6) service to the institution.”
The document allows for stu-
dent participation in fadging
criteria 3, 4, and 6. Section III,
“Roles of Faculty, Students,
and Administration in the
Evaluation Procedure,’’ limits
student participation to a rout-
inely administered evaluation
form’’ supplemented by inter-
views and letters. But nowhere
does the document require the
introduction of interviews and
letters in any part of the
process. Nor will students be
invited to join in the discussion
of points 1 or 5.

In judging’ the excellence of
curriculum design students are
specifically excluded from con-
tributing in any substantive
way. This will not do. Excel-
lence in curriculum design can-
not be comprehensively judged
without considering its effect in
‘the classroom. _ : :

According to the Code, “by
the very nature of their status,
students are not in a position to
assess professional competence
or even the design of syllabi,
but they are in a position to
comment on the instuctor’s
enthusiasm, his.or her concern
for them, and whether or not
‘they feel he-or she has helped

them in understanding the
subject matter.’’ For the most
part, this view is sound; how-
ever, it does not explain the
reduction of student participa-
tion to mere statistices yielded
by some variant of the S.I.R.
form.

Students are not competent
to judge all facets of profes-
sional ability. But as the Code
points out, ‘‘Students are quick
to perceive which of their in-
structors are active profession-
als, which merely living on past
capital.’’ Students may not be
in a position to judge the total

Brown

quality of a syllabus or curricu-

lum, but they can and should be
allowed to comment upon them.
In the past students have
demonstrated their eagerness
and ability to discuss and
responsibly criticize curriculum
by creating courses, conferring
with professors on the design of
courses, and speaking out on
matters of educational policy.

Statistics without spokesmen
will be misused, not because of
the ill-will brought to bear by
any individual but because sta-
tistics do not leave room for
subjectivity. As Dr. Zimmer-
mann notes throughout the
Code the element of subjectivity
in evaluation cannot be elimina-
ted; no impersonal formulae
exist for the judging of charac-
ter, competence, or distinction.
Yet reliance upon an ‘‘evalua-
tion form’’ quashes the subjec-
tive element in student opinion
by refusing it a voice. Direct
student involvement in the
evaluation procedures will com-
plement statistical analysis and
make for a more comprehensive
evaluation.

I do not wish to imply that
the Code seeks the exclusion of
student opinion in the evalua-
tion of faculty. It does not. But
it should require the active
solicitation of non-statistical
student opinion on all points of
evaluation. A standard evalua-
tion form without a living voice
to interpret it will produce an

inconclusive body of statistics,

which may misrepresent rather
than represent actual attitudes.

The question.of interpreting
and realizing Davidson’s Chris-
tian committment arises both in
the hiring of new faculty and
the granting of tenure to the

\

old. The complexity of the issue
derives largely from conflicting
interpretation of three lines of
the Statement of Purpose:
“Davidson recognizes God as
the source of all truth. As a
college commited to the historic
Christian faith, it sees Jesus
Christ as the central fact of
history, giving purpose, order
and value to the whole of life.
Davidson is dedicated to the
quest for truth and would set no
limits to the adventures of the
mind.’’ The statement is self-
consistent, but recent events
show a contradictiction in its
application by this administra-
tion. The Code should state that
Davidson’s Christian commit-
ment does not imply a commit-
ment to religious conformity. It
makes no such statement. We
fail to see how a vocal non-
Ciwistian could be hired under
the Code as it now stands; thus,
we are not convinced that
anything in the college’s proce-
dures for hiring and the award-
ing of tenure have changed
since the Ron Linden case. The
joint statement issued in the
midst of the Linden controversy
still expresses the problems
faced by this college.

“The crucial question, then,
is whether that Christian com-
mitment can best be served by a
hiring policy which in. practice
excludes the presence of non-
Christians on the Davidson
faculty.”” We believe that the
Code, by its tacit acceptance of
a religious requirement for
tenure and hiring, will restrict
faculty recruiting, cause further
embarrassment to the college,
and foster a misleading impres-
sion of Davidson’s character.

Institutional insecurity con-
tributes nothing to Christian
commitment; the conviction
behind the commitment draws
its strength from the belief that
Christianity best defends itself
in an open and accessible forum
--not in isolation. In one ap-
proach lies all the rich diversity
which debate can foster, in the
other lies a frank confession of
weakness.

I have tried to be as clear and
succinct as possible in presen-
ting some objection to two
major points of the Code. The
Code, as it stands, is unsatis-
factory. There are other reasons
and other parts of the Code
which may and should give rise
to controversy. This document
should not be affirmed and
passed on as it stands. It
contams too many ambiguities
and entails too many problems.
Neither should it be incorpo-
rated into the corpus of the
college regulations before a full
and complete discussion has
been allowed to develop, and
adequate time has been given
for the amendment of this Code.

Letter to the Editor

Don't shaft Herb

To the Editor—

I wish to direct my comments
in response to Mr. J. Eric
Roskos on his attempt to give
readers of The Davidsonian the
impression that “Premeds get
shaft on MCAT test site” due to
an “assertion of authority’ by
Dr. Herb Jackson of the Art
department. If this was your
intention, Mr. Roskos, then you
have been most successful with
your efforts. In doing so you
have also directed unfair criti-
cism at a man who is most
dedicated to the interests of
Davidson College and its stu-

dente: a.
Dr. Jackson has not, at any

point, denied use of the gallery
to anyone for testing or other
‘‘multi-purpose’’ activities, in-
cluding the April 15th MCAT
tests. Although he controls the
organization and operation of
the type of art to be exhibited,
he has absolutely no authority
to open and close the gallery at
will, as you have mistakenly
indicated.

Dr. Jackson had intended to
have the exhibition moved aside
on April 15 according to the
wishes of those faculty in
charge of the MCAT testing,
but the occurrence of Alumni
Weekend (that same weekend)
forced an administrative deci-
sion to leave the gallery open for
the visiting alumni. As far as
your statement that ‘‘the gall-
ery was locked during the exam
period”’ is concerned, I can only
say that I was working the

normal weekend gallery shift -

from 2-5 and that the gallery
was definitely open with plenty
of excited and interested alumni
looking at the Bearden show,
the largest attraction to our
gallery all year. Had the gallery
been used for MCAT testing,
the noise of alumni registration
just outside its doors in Cham-
bers lobby would surely have
proved to have been a distrac-
tion anyway.

So it seems, Mr. Roskos, that
the problem was not primarily
due to the more than two years
of planning on the part of Herb
Jackson to secure this show of
Romare Bearden, the nation’s
most recognized black artist,
but rather that there was not
another room which could be
used as an alternative multi-
purpose room for MCAT test-

In response to your state.
ment that the gallery ‘‘was
funded and built with the inten.
tion that it would be used as a
multi-purpose facility, but it
is not used thus,”’ I must say
that the original use of Cham.
bers 100 was as a cafeteria and
not as a “multi-purpose facij-
ity.’”’ Since then it has been gen.
erously approved as the new art
gallery in addition to a mutti-
purpose room and fosters such
masters as Rembrandt, Van
Gogh, Albrecht Durer, Pablo
Picasso, and Toulouse LaTrec,
as well as other modern artists
and the special exhibition ser.
ies.

Unfortunately, such an exhi-
bition is considered a priority
secondary to the’ numerous
functions which occur regularly
and which are limiting the
Bearden show to, at present,
only half of its originally
planned operating schedule.
Such functions include its use
for the lectures series, lunch-
eons, Update mailings, alumni
receptions, dinners, dances, and
even testing programs as evid-
enced the following Saturday,
April 22, when a test similar to
the MCAT (the GRE) was held.

I am sorry that such stagnant
views as Mr. Roskos’ are rep-
resentative of many similar
verbal attacks on Herb Jackson
and his efforts to integrate
“arts’’ into the supposed ‘“‘liber-
al arts’’ structure here at Dav-
idson, but I cannot believe that
asking ourselves, as Mr. Ros-
kos suggests, ‘‘if Davidson
values more its academic repu-
tation, or its cultural status..."
has any significance to the inte-
grity of Dr. Herb Jackson.

Granted, Mr. Roskos, a prob-
lem does exist ‘in trying to
maintain such a high caliber art
gallery and in finding a place for ve
an activity room, but to place
the burden of this awkward
situation on Dr. Jackson or to
imply that he is the cause for
premeds “‘getting the shaft’’ is
uncalled for. Rather, I would
think that the students and fac-
ulty would encourage and sup-
port the efforts of a man who
has struggled to maintain Dav-
idson’s artistic significance and
to establish a greater degree of
truly ‘‘liberal’’ arts on our
campus.
