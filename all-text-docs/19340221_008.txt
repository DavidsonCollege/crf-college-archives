Soccer Draws Interest
Of Davidson Students

Considerable interest has been shown
in soccer this year. Students form
teams every day and play in the field
north of Chambers or on the fresh-
man field. The college recently “erect-
ed goal posts and laid off a field for
soccer games on the freshman field.

An exhibition game was played
Tuesday, February 13, between the
Missionaries and the Philistines, com-
monly known. as the “ Missionaries”
and the “Devils.” Audley Gammond,
captain of the Missionaries, defeated
Jim Cothran’s team, the Philistines,
by a score of, four to three. Much
interest was shown in the game by
the large number of students playing
it. This game was to illustrate how
to play soccer, which is somewhat of
a new sport at: Davidson.

Due to the rapidly increasing pop-
ularity of soccer, Captain: Pritchett
stated: “Soccer will be placed on the

THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 21, 1934

in the 135-pound class, requiring anjintramural sport program next fall.”

No-soccer-gamesbetween classes wilt
be held this year. Balls will be avail-
able for playing any time teams wish
ito play.

Many students, who have played
soccer elsewhere, are very eager to
see it developed into one of Davidson's
leading ‘sports.

Active Week Brings to _
Close Winter Program

Davidson Wildcat athletic teams
bring to a close this week their win-
ter sports schedules, with five contests
on the ticket for the three aggrega-
tions, the varsity wrestling team, and
the varsity and freshman basketball
clubs.

Tuesday night the Wildkitten quintet
met the Boiling Springs Junior Col-
lege five on the Boiling Springs court.
Friday night the freshmen meet the
Crossnore High team» and the varsity
meets the fast quintet from Erskine,
in the final game of the season for the
Wildcats.

Saturday night the Wildkittens go
into action for the last time, meeting
the Burlington High School team, and
Doc Unger’s wrestlers meet the grap-
plers from N. C. State.

rope. The conflicting parties in France
are very numerous and very strong.
There is little love lost between them.
At the same time the different ele-
ments in Austria are-in an even more
tense and conflicting situation, Situ-
ated as it is between Germany, the
center of Hitlerism, on one side, and
Italy, the’¢enter of Mussolini’s forces,
on the other, the poor Austrians with
elements of both Socialism and Com-
munism are in a terrible fix. Doumer-
gue reveals a mailed fist and tells the
French cabinet what it can do. Italy
sends troops to the Austrian border.
England tells France, Italy, and the
rest of Europe hands off Austria. Not
that they want to interfere, but only to
keep Germany out. And Mustapha
Kemal over in Turkey is building up
his defenses and organizing a compe-
tent army. The time is coming and
even now Mars is licking his chops.

versity, Charles Grant Robertson, in
his annual report to the board of re-
gents, said that the combined percent-
age of first-class brains in all classes
of Britain was four or five per cent.

university or college depended on
whether or not the institution received
its share of these. high-class brains.
Twenty per cent of the population was
sub-normal in intellectual capacity.

His réport was the result of 40 years

FIRING AT RANDOM
(Continued from page 7)
lowed Davidson teams as boys will re-
member Dick Grey’s educated toe,
Jack Black’s line-plunging, and_ the
stellar line play of Thad Brock, Buddy
Gardner, Red Baker, and Hugh Grey.

One thing of particular interest is that
Dick-and-Hugh~-Grey-and- Jack Biack
are local boys, and Thad Brock is a
product of Barium Springs. It might
also be noted that most of the first-
stringers at one time captained a Wild-
cat team. Mackorell and Flowers are
the only two men to land berths for
less than three years’ service, David-
son’s versatile Mackorell is also one
of the leading contenders for the Char-
lotte Observer’s Flaming Five.
Those who are interested in na-
ture, outdoor life, hunting and the
like, will enjoy reading the column
by Frederick Smith in the Char-
lotte Observer. His column re-
places Jake Wade's Sports Parade
every Monday morning. It usually
contains some good hunting, fish-
ing, or nature story and is always
very interesting.

Carolina romped away with the state
basketball crown by defeating the
Duke Blue Devils for the second time
in one season, This is a feat that the
U. N. C. boys have not been able to
accomplish in quite a few years. All
eyes are now turned to the Southern
Conference tournament.to be staged
in Raleigh. There’s going to be a fine
brand of basketball exhibited over
there before any team takes the title.
This department picks South Carolina
to come off with it again finally, Let’s
wait and see.
