Campus Safety: The Balancing Act

We understand Robbie Lee’s
anger and frustration with the inci-
dent that she was involved in and
the treatment she received on the
night in which it occured. As was
stated to her, there is no good ex-
cuse why she wasn’t accompanied
by the police or someone else to
help her find a magistrate early on
a Saturday morning in Charlotte.
We very much regret the fear and
inconvenience Robbie suffered
from this oversight. We have been
assured by the Campus Police that
this incident has resulted in a
change in their protocol, and they
will insure that someone will
acompany a student should the
need occur in the future.

Robbie also stated that this
office “made it clear” that we did
not like The Davidsonian article

concerning this incident. The inci-
dent itself is a matter of public
record and should have been re-

ported. We not only support that

but are thankful for it. However,
we cannot provide the

having knives that are considered
a weapon. (See pages 5,6, and 37
of the Red Book and page 39 of the
catalogue.) We make every effort
to communicate to you threats to

cess rights of both the victims and
the accused was and always will
be the case. Balancing the need for

_the community to be made aware

of threats to their safety with the

names of victims to the
newspapers or comment
about a case that is part
of on-campus judicial
proceedings. If Ms. Lee
chooses to talk to The
Davidsonian or anyone
else that is her right.
Robbie is right
when she states that
Davidson is not a para-
dise where you are al-

“Keeping secrets” is not what
was done in this case;
protecting the privacy and
due process rights of both the
- victims and the accused was
and always will be the case.

protected privacy rights of
individual students is both
our challenge and our re-
sponsibility.

Finally, it is not unusual
at larger, state universities
for a portion of the student
activity fee to be spent on
hiring attorneys to work on
specific student needs.
Their work often includes
landlord/tenant disputes
and other contractual rela-

ways safe, despite our best at-
tempts to make it so. The student
offender violated North Carolina

State law and College policy by

your personal safety whenever we
are aware of it. “Keeping secrets”
is not what was done in this case;
protecting the privacy and due pro-

tionships. However, rarely do they
represent one student against an-
other. We urge Davidson students

interested in such services to re-

quest them from the SGA via the
Activities Tax Council. —

This was a terrible, unfortu-
nate incident that is still not over
for any of the individuals involved.
We will continue to do what we
can for Robbie and the student
who was injured. We will con-
tinue our efforts to insure that other
students have the assistance they
need no matter what hour of the
night it might be. In addition to the
Campus Police, Hall Counselors,
Resident Advisors, representatives
of the Dean of Students office are
all available 24 hours a day and
trained torespond when contacted.
I hope our entire community can
learn from a situation in which
excessive use of alcohol, anger and
a violation of state law led to an
incident that disturbs us all.

Give Alternatively

If you are like most Davidson
students, your Christmas shop-
ping was completed weeks ago,
during that low time between Fall
Break and Thanksgiving when
there is little to do around here.
But you have a nagging feeling
that one item is missing. In addi-
tion to the Davidson T-shirts,
Davidson mugs, and Davidson
key rings, you sense that what
your family and friends really

want for Christmas is a Creole

pig. Luckily, Creole pigs, along
eight acres of rainforest, solar
cookers, and soybeans will be on
sale during a community-wide
gathering and gift-fair held in the
College Union from 2:00 to 4:00
on December 8th. The event, an
Alternative Gift Fair, is designed
to give a new twist to holiday
giving. The pig you purchase will
provide a renewable source of in-
come for a household in Haiti as
its offspring can be sold for profit
or used to feed the family. If you
are interested instead in purchas-
ing a solar cooker, your gift will be
sent to individuals in Ethiopia
and Kenya to be used as an energy
efficient method of meal prepara-
tion.

The Chaplain’s office, the

Chapel Committee and various. .

other student organizations, in-
cluding the Patterson Court houses
and religious groups are sponsor-
ing the third annual Alternative
Gift Fair with the theme "Give the
World aChristmas Present.” Items
such as food, medical assistance,
education, and shelter purchased
in the name of a loved one will be
sent to people in need around the
world. Shoppers receive Christ-
mas cards with a description of the
gift and its destination ready to
mail or deliver as alternative gifts.
The Alternative Gift Fair is a
great way to give a gift that will
be shared by many. An entire vil-
lage in Bangladesh will celebrate
acres of soy beans planted in their
region which will help ease the
despératé food shortage: Families
in Mozambique will rejoice in the
goats and ducks sent to populate
their farms. Even simple gifts like
-ahot meal for homeless children
in Brazil or medicine for Rwandan
orphans will help people who may
not have been expecting a Christ-
mas gift this year and bring joy to
donors and recipients alike. Other
gifts on sale this year include
wheelchairs and crutches for vic-
tims of violence in Bosnia, build-

ing supplies for community cen-

ter in a low income area along the

U.S./Mexican border, and job
training for Palestinian refugees.
The Christmas spirit can also be
shared locally with a gift of meals
for seniors at Davidson’s Senior
Nutrition Center or hours of after
school activities for Davidson
youth at the Ada Jenkins Center.

Since the founding of the Al-
ternative Gift Market, Inc. in 1980,
annual fairs have been held in
Churches, schools, and organiza-
tions across the country. The
founder and president, Harriet C.
Pritchard believes that the “‘inter-
national projects are life-giving,
life-saving, and life-extending, for
all races and religious groups.
The Markets offer shoppers the
opportunity to preserve our en-
dangered planet as well as help
the hungry, sick, and homeless
people around the world - help
themselves. Instead of shopping
for presents friends and family
here may not need or even want,
we'can give gifts of hope and new
life to a needy world" .

So, avoid the frantic crowds
of shoppers and the frustration
which often attends the holiday
season and join the Alternative
Gift Fair in celebrating Christmas
in a new way. -

am over the initial shock of liv-
ing in Corntown, I have become
more aware of my surroundings;
this has its’: downsides.. Down-
side number one: I figured out
that the glowing light which
illuminates our balcony with an
eerie glow emanates from the
largest mini-van dealership in
the Carolinas. I am bathed in
van lighting. Oh, how it hurts.
If you think that vans are
the worst thing in Cornelius —
and I understand this way of
thinking — then you don’t live
there. The traffic puts the Cross
Bronx Expressway to shame.
‘Even though the potholes of the
Cross Bronx Expressway are
large enough to house people
(and they do) and people have
been known to repel down from
overpasses to rob you while you
sit in traffic, I still prefer driving
in NYC to driving in Cornelius.
At least in New York the
lights change. If they deign to
change in Cornelius, you can’t
go anyway because there is some
woman with frost and tip hair
pretending to talk on her cell-
phone while checking her re-
flection in the mirror. Cornelius
is inhabited by people who pre-

‘phones. Imagine their conversa-
tions — “Well, first I am going

Traveling to and from
Cornelius shouldn’t be diffi-
cult. It’s justnot worth the hassle.
If I were lucky enough to live in
Davidson then I would NEVER
go to Cornelius. Conversely, I
would ride a big wheel if it were
the only way to get to New York.

Inthe past six years, 600,000
people have moved to North
Carolina. I think that they all
live in Cornelius. These are the
same 600,000 people who voted
for Jesse Helms. Thank you ever
so much. You deserve him. Of
course, there’s no art to ban in
Cornelius, unless you count
some of the “sculptures” at
Irma’s Lingerie, or the bagel art
at Bruegger’s. If you do count
these things as art, you’d be hap-
pier than I am in Cornelius.
There are not as many foreign-
ers to despise in Cornelius as
Helms might like. Surprisingly,
I did meet some Israelis in Cari-
bou Coffee. They were equally
surprised to see someone read-

that potential relationship by re-
ferring to how I would love to
visit Palestine pparently, Iam
alittle too candid with my politi-
cal views.

One of my friends, okay,
editors, said that I would prob-
ably get evicted for writing this
piece. Everyone has a dream
