OUR PEELING.

The precise analysis of our feeling in
entering upon these editorial duties is a
difficult one. It certainly is not like
that of the imaginative, glittering poct
vcho sat before a piece of statuary and
an “ebony bird” which was saying
“Nevermore, Nevermore.” But it ap-
proaches the seriousness and the respon-
sibility of him who is guiding our nation
thru perils and storms and divers kinds
of fierce annoyances. We have a great
feeling and appreciation for our college
and those things for which it stands, an4
for those “trained, devoted, and inspired
alumni” who are glorying in their Alma
Mater,

OUR DERT.

We are richly endowed by former
editorial staffs with a fund of principle
in journalism which will be invaluable
to us in giving you the paper which yor
deserve. The staff is intensely grateful
to those who have gone before us, whe
have given us the system on which our
paper is edited. And it is fitting to sa
that we believe this system does not have
its equal in the South. Again, we are
indebted to those students who work in-
defatigably for this publication. And to
the alumni, we thank you for the interest
which is accorded THe Davinsonian.

" OUR PURPOSE.

It is our purpose to maintain and in
crease the standard of THe Davinson-
IAN. In an attractively written form we
intend to publish the news of the col-
lege. We intend to draw the alumn’
closer—to make friends better friends—
and to co-operate with those in concert-
ed action to further Davidson’s interests.
And we are going to defend and main-
tain high standards of student honor and
integritv.

To do this we need the co-operation
of student body, faculty and alumni. If
you apnreciate the efforts made on the
part of the staff you are going to give
us your support.

Your attertion is directed to two ar-
ticles appearing in this issue: one con-
cerning the organization of the Rifle
Club: the other, an article in the Forum
which is voicing the standard of demrc-
racv as acainst blatant militarism. Thi-
Rifle Club movement is in vogue in sev-
eral colleges of the South. At the Uni-

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, March 28, 1917

vefsity of North Carolina there is :
‘lub of one hundred who are doing dril
work. They moved benches from thei:
Memorial Hall to begin their drill. W«
ave space, too—the Commencement
Hall,

But what is the need of this? Man:
say “Preparedness” —the same thing yot
have heard for several years. The Dav-
idson man jvho docs not volunteer at
first call is neither ‘“‘cold-footed” nor
(in football venacular) “yellow.” When
our country is in imminent peril then
the true Davidson spirit will exert it-
self. During the Civil War the sons 0‘
Davidson went to the front and fought
like men. They will do it again if nec-
essary. But is it right to infuse a lot of
military tactics into the mind of thc
student—to keep him in a high tensior
of war—at this stage of the game?
Should this be done at the cost of schol-
astic neglect, which inevitably results?
Your country has not called you. Dr.
J. M. McConnell, says that he thinks it
‘mprobable that if we go to war with
Germany that we will have to furnish
land forces. And they do not use rifles
of calibre used here in submarines nor
does our Navy attempt to puncture
armor plate with a bullet so minute.

BASEBALL.

Today swings us into a new cycle
—baseball. The fight for the champion-
ship is on. Twenty games are scheduled
—of this number cight are to be played
on Sprunt Field. The team is in fine
form and the practice has been thoro.
And the same Red and Black spirit,
which is characteristic of all of David-
son’s teams, goes out with them to vic-
tory.

Our team usually gets good support.
This season indications are that support
will be better than in former years, ‘Che
principle of support is a psychological
factor—the team is made to feel the im-
portance of the game—“pep” is incul-
cated into the team and the players are
stimulated to victory.

But there is a form of excess energy
often seen on athletic fields wisich is in-
tended to help the team—but it is of the
negative kind—a hindrance. ‘This is
guying and “horsing” the opponents. At
Davidson this is not countenanced by
the coach nor by other authorities, It
has been relegated to the relics of prep-
schoolism. Probably in high school at
one of your great games, after -yapping
at your opponents in a shameful man-
ner, you were approached by your “blue
flower"—and_ she, smilingly, informed
you that you had starred in your en-
thusiasm. Forget this clement of glory
—it does not go at Davidson.

We quote the National Collegiate As-
sociation: ‘Talking to your opponents,
if it falls short of being abusive or in-
sulting, is not prohibited by the rules,
partly because it.ought not to be neces
sary and partly because no rules can
make a gentleman out of a mucker. Ne
good sportsman is ever guilty of cheap
talk to his opponents.” This was in-
tended for thé players, but we give it
for those who might think that college
ideals ran in lower levels.

Dr. W. L. Dudley, of Vanderbilt.
once President of the S. I. A. A., says:
“The athletic field is one of the greates'
laboratories in an institution of learning
for developing personal honor, self-con-
trol, and courtesy.” Not for a moment
would you think of going into th
science laboratories and materially de
tracting the focused attention of the stu-
dent at his desk. You respect his pur.
pose in view—the training and knowl.
edge he is getting. Then your team an”
their opponents are in the same lab

Did you ever stop to think

of the direct advantages to be gained from
printing that will catch the eye and hold it long@
enough to create a favorable attitude on the part of
the buying public? Printing of the ordinary kind
has become so weatherbeaten by unlimited usage
that the impression formed in the mind of the busi-
ness man of to-day is one of continuous and depress-
sameness—a
around-more” disposition on the part of him who
wants something just a little different, if not entircly
distinctive, when compired with the current station-
ery that reaches his office.

We invite a careful and studied analysis of the
