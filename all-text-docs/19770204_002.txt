The North Carolina Public

Interest Research Group is

presently conducting its sur-

vey of off-campus students for

its upcoming housing guide.

Someone should be calling
each house within the next
week for information regard-
ing residents’ rental situa-
tions. If your off-campus
house hasn’t been contacted
by next Friday, please inform
Kathy McLendon (B 468,
-3060) so she can include ~~
in the survey.

A panel of experts on pri-
sons and their reform con-

Surv eys off-

yaneuey 13th. Present were
Richard Urbanic of the N.C.
Department of Corrections,
John Campbell, head of the
Prison Grievance Committee,
and Jeff Campbell, director of
ECO, the ex-convicts organi-
zation in Charlotte.

Each participant gave his
15-minute presentation and
then opened the floor to ques-
tions. Everyone agreed that
the priéon system punishes
instead of rehabilitating, but
the panelists disagreed on
remedies for the problems.

Jeff Campbell recommended
that all but the hard-core
malcontents be handled some-

where other than prison be-
cause of the dehumanizing
effects of confinement. Dr.
Urbanic suggested building
more facilities to relieve the
overcrowding and to upgrade
the existing units. John
Campbell advocated an in-
crease in health, recreational
and educational opportunities.

All, however, stressed that
prison should be viewed as a

‘part of an overall system of

justice that includes society as
a key link. They emphasized
that anything done in a part of
the system will have effects on
the entire system’s ultimate
outcome.

The next event in the prison
reform series will be the ap-
pearance on campus of Jessica
Mitford, author of Kind and
Usual Punishment: The Pri-
son Business, all day on

March 24th.

At the upcoming Southern
PIRG Regional Conference,
the Governing Council of the
National PIRG’s Clearing-
house and Educational Fund
will meet.

After several years of inten-
sive planning, the National
PIRG Clearinghouse was for-

mally established by the var-
ious state PIRG’s and CAG’s
attending the National PIRG
Conference at Minneapolis,
Minn., in August, 1976.

The Clearinghouse is to
serve as an information and
resource center to draw the
member PIRG’s closer toget-
her. It is presently located in
Oakdale, Iowa, under the su-
pervision of lowa PIRG whose
director has pledged his sup-
port and group’s facilities.

Each member group of the
Clearinghouse has one person
on the Governing Council,
which is in charge of the
overall organization. This
group meets twice a year to
map out general policy and
entrusts the Executive Com-
mittee, the Chairperson, Sec
retary and Treasurer—to exe-
cute their judgments as well as
make decisions in their ab-
sence.

Funding is provided by each
member PIRG or CAG in the
amount of one percent of its
yearly budget. (North Caro-
lina’s share is $300 since our
budget is $30,000). Add to
this a Comprehensive Educ-
ational Training Act (CETA)
grant for the director Marc

campus students

Baer, and the total budget is
$22,500.

This area of funding is
expected to be a source of
much discussion at the up-
coming meetings. Most feel
that the present funding mec-
hanism is self-limiting and too
small to run a national organi-
zation.

Also on the agenda is a
proposal for research and joint
action. This proposal, known
as'the National PIRG project,
would make PIRG visible as a
national entity as well as give
it the capacity to lobby on
issues with the information
gathered from the various
states.

The National PIRG project
would increase the organiza-
tion’s effectiveness, since
many problems that are con-
fronted can only be solved at
the national level. Other prob-
lems’then arise, most notably
what projects are chosen and
the possible new location of
the Clearinghouse.

Mark Dunlea of New York
PIRG is Chairperson of the
Clearinghouse. He and others.
across the continent will be at
Duke University from March 4
to 6.
