Some thoughts on The World Baseball Classic

By ALEX ARINSMIER
Guest Columnist

Did you notice?

Amid the madness of college basketball
and brackets, The World Baseball Classic
came to a close last week.

Japan defeated Cuba 10-6 in the champi-
onship game played in San Diego, being
crowned the “authentic world champion” of
baseball.

In case you didn’t know anything about
the tournament, I’ll give you the essentials.
The World Baseball Classic is a 16 country
baseball tournament with games played in
different regions of the globe. This was the
first year of the tournament, which will be
played every four years to coincide with the
Olympic Games. The main goal of the
Classic was to declare an undisputed world
champion. A secondary goal was to increase
the overall baseball fan base through nation-
al pride.

Taking a quick glance, it appears the
Classic achieved these goals. Japan won fair
and square, and the attendance for all 39
games played was 737,112. Many players
were quoted stating how they had goose-
bumps putting on their uniforms and felt
more excitement during the Classic than dur-
ing a World Series Game.

Fine. I feel all fuzzy inside now that we
know Japan is the true champion and every-
one around the globe likes baseball.
However, as I tried to watch the champi-
onship game and saw that only two Major
League players were on the two respective
rosters, a thought dawned up on me: didn’t
we invent baseball? Where are the
Americans?

Team USA was easily one of the favorites
going into the tournament. A stacked lineup
of MLB players was ready to play this

Japan won the World Baseball Classic last week. The United States didn’t fare
nearly as well, losing to Korea and Mexico.

American game of baseball the only way we
know how: hit as many home runs as you
can. We soon learned we really didn’t know
how to play the game which we invented,
and that the rest of the world is playing it bet-
ter than we are.

We barely squeaked out of the first round
of the tournament, losing to Canada (yes,
Canada) but managing to win the tie-breaker
to move on to the second round. Oh, the sec-
ond round was the true wake up call. Team
USA lost to Korea, Mexico, and should have
lost to Japan (a replay shows a bad call by
the third base umpire on a crucial play late in
the game).

Why did we lose so badly? Simply stated,
we really don’t know how to play baseball

anymore.

Sure, we can hit home runs. Lots of them.
Americans love power. It brings in the fans.
Gets you a spot on SportsCenter. As Tom
Glavine and Greg Maddux nicely put it,
“Chicks dig the long ball.”

But the rest of the world actually plays the
way we used to: manufacture runs, bunt,
move runners over, and solid control and
placement by their pitchers. We used to play
like that. Some MLB teams still do. But look
at their rosters. Hardly any of them are
Americans.

Not to say that’s a bad thing. One would
expect Major League owners to bring in the
best talent for their teams. It makes for better
baseball and a better product to fans. This is
America, the melting pot of the world, the
land of opportunity.

The only problem occurs when there is a
tournament such as the World Classic and
the guys you used to cheer on everyday are
now waving their respective countries flags
and trying to stick it to America. I was
amazed when I saw the rosters for
Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican

Republic: they were full of current and for-
mer MLB All Stars.

I had a real problem with that while watch-
ing the Classic. That whole national pride
thing swept across my body, and I fully
expected not to just win, but dominate the
tournament. I was naive, just like everyone
else.

It’s also true Team USA didn’t exactly get
full support from American MLB players or
owners. Some guys didn’t play because they
were worried about injuries, or not getting
enough at bats and hurting their spring train-
ing time. Others, like Gary Sheffield, simply
didn’t play because they weren’t being paid.
It’s also difficult when someone as influen-
tial as George Steinbrenner publicly criti-
cizes his players’ role in the Classic. But
when it comes down to it, those are just
excuses. We lost because we didn’t play well
enough to win. We didn’t deserve to. And
being an American sports fan, I feel my team
must win all the time. I mean, we’re
America.

So what does this say about America’s
favorite pastime? In this land of steroid alle-
gations, can we overcome our craving for the
long ball and produce real American talent?
Maybe. It would be great to see the emer-
gence of our own Ichiro, a guy who can get
200 hits in a season where only seven are
home runs.

That won’t really bring in fans. But it will
produce championships. It will give
American fans the thing they love the most:
a winner.

The Major League Baseball season begins
on Sunday. Fans will get over the bad per-
formance of Team USA and focus on the
new season of their favorite club. And we’re
sure to see a lot of homeruns.

But with teams like the White Sox and
Cardinals, playing traditional baseball and
winning consistently, there is hope for Team
USA in 2009. America still has the biggest
pool of baseball talent in the world.
Hopefully we can do the little things that
made American baseball great. Hopefully we
can rid our obsession with home runs. And
hopefully, just maybe, we can get back to
winning in baseball. After all, we did invent
it

Golf finishes ninth at
Furman Intellcollegiate

By Monica JAMONEAU
Sports Editor

The golf team took a road trip to Furman
last weekend and after
placing a steady 12th in the
first two days of the 37th
Annual Furman
Intercollegiate, rose three
spots to finish in ninth
place.

Action began on Friday
when Steve Mayo ’07 tied
for fifth individually with a
71 (-1) in the opening
round. The ’Cats finished
the first day of the 54-hole
competition in 12th place.
Tim Dillon ’06 shot a 73
for the day, tying for 16th
individually.

On Saturday, Davidson
shot a stroke over the previ-
ous day’s total, with 304
(+16), enough to remain in 12th.

Mayo also rose in strokes, putting up a 78
(+6) and fell to 27th place individually.
Dillon shot best for Davidson with a 74 (+2)
and found himself tied for 19th at the end of
the second round.

David Fowler ’09 and Alex Knoll ’07 both
shot 76 (+4), Michael Saari ’09 shot an 84,
and Christian Davis ’06 finished the day

Tim Dillon 06 finished
16th in individual competi-
tion at the Furman
Intercollegiate.

with 78.

On day three of the 54-hole event, Dillon
once again played strongly, shooting 73 (+1)
and ending the intercollegiate with 220 (+4).
He tied for 12th individually
and helped his team, whose
shot total was 300 after the
final round, rise three spots to
occupy ninth place overall.

Saari shot a 71, one under
par, on the last day to record
the Wildcats’ lowest score.
Mayo placed 59th out of the
85-person field, shooting an
82 on Sunday.

Fowler rounded out the
three-day event tied for 62th,
while Knoll tied for 76th and
Davis tied for 90th. Davis was
competing as an individual
and his score was not counted
with the rest of the Wildcat
team.

The Furman Intercollegiate
is played at Furman University and has been
won by PGA tour winners Curtis Strange,
Jay Haas, Mark Calcavecchia, Brad Faxon,
Billy Andrade, David Duval and Matt
Kuchar.

The Wildcats will compete in their final
event of the regular season next weekend at
the Wofford Collegiate, another 54-hole
event held in Spartanburg, S.C.
