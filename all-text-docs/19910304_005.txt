Many Thanks

As the new Editor-in-Chief.of The Davidsonian, I
would like to express many thanks to former editors,
Mark Puckett and Jay Chaudhuri. Before Jay and Mark
took control last year, The Davidsonian was produced
infrequently by a limited staff. Mark and Jay have
developed a framework through which The Davidsonian
has come out almost every week of the school year. They
have assembled a fine staff of assisstant editors, section
editors, reporters and columnists. The quality of the
paper has increased exponentially under their leadership,
and they deserve hearty congratulations for thier work.

‘Where Were You?,

The SGA hosted a Gulf Crisis Conference last Satur-
day afternoon. The funny thing is that it was supposed to -
begin on Saturday morning. Those of us who were there
at 10:00am stood around with our coffee and wondered
whether we were the only people on campus who really ._
thought enough about the-war to get out of bed on a
Saturday.

Professors Appleyard, Denham, Gibson, Kaylor,
Mahony, and Maydoleall prepared talks for the morning
information sessions. Due to the general apapthy among
the Davidson communtiy, however, these talks were left
undelivered. Fortunately for those who attended the
round table discusssion in the afternoon, these and other
professors incorporated many of their extremely enlight-

ening points into the conversation. It's too bad that only...

thirty or so other people got to hear and discuss them.

Allthose who contibuted to the conference, especially
Sarah Sadowski, deserve thanks for their hardwork.
These efforts resulted in a productive afternoon of timely,
intellectual discussion. It seems sad that, even at sucha
fine institution as Davidson, intellectual disussion can't

- get anybody out of bed.

Clark Blasts Davidsonian

Editors

To the “Editors:”

I formally retract my
previousarticle from the Jan.
28th issue of . the
Davidsonian.

Yeah, okay, you proba-
bly don’t care or can’t re-
member that piece of
journalism, Tips To Travel
By. If that’s the case, then
I’m off the hook. Why?
Because after you guys got
finished “editing,” I couldn’t
recognize if.

Alright, Ttake that back.

I did recognize it (albeit
barely), ,;which was. even
worse. Look, I’ve only been
abroad for 6 months, it’s not
like I’ve totally lost control
of my native language. So
why hack my entire article
with clumsy, needless cor-
rections and additions?
Take for example the
sentence, “Igloo building is
not an accomodation op-
tion.” [didn’t write this. Ditto
for “Thank you Beave,”“La-
dee-da,” “ad nauseum.”

Furthermore, the grammati-
cal changes did almostnoth-
ing other than to totally alter
the style.

I hate to print out the
obvious, but the title “edi-
tor” does not give you the
liberty to slash and burn your
way through my column like
you’re on a jungle safari. So
at least do me one favor and
leave this rebuttal as is.

Thanks (not),
<anis Clark ‘92

Py SA Update from Madrid

To Davidson:

I was amused by the
news story. in the Feb. 4th
issue of the Davidsonian,
indicating that American
students abroad could be-
come terrorist targets. The
headline read: “Students
Abroad Could Become Tar-
gets”. Well, whata comfort-
ing thought for all the
Davidson parents who’ve
sent junior and missy to
Europe. The article also
states that the program di-
rectors will heed advice,
sagacious no doubt, from the
State Department.

Well, wouldn’t you

mbit it, the State Depart-

ment has indeed dished out,
some advice: don’t wear pro-
American decals and such,
don’t travel in large groups,
and, intheir infinite wisdom,
they’ ve advised the students
nottochew gum. Believe it!

See, according to the sage -
- I mean|-- State Depart-
ment, Americans are notori-
ous for chewing gum, and
the act of doing such here in
Madrid could bring dire
consequences. The group
here in Madrid gotachuckle
out of that one.

Well, we're all doing
fine here in Madrid save for
a couple of reasons. The
dollar, obeying most duti-
fully Newton’s law of grav-
ity, continues to plummet.

And with it, some of our

hopes of travelling exten-
sively. Also, we’re experi-
encing a brutal winter, with
temperatures around freez-
ing regardless of the time of

‘day. One member of our

group, a Itearty Northerner,
has even had to wear socks.
Well, imagine that.

we’ ve had occasion toreada
great dramatic work, and
then attend the performance
the same evening. It’s awe
inspiring I tell you. In fact, a
certain member of our group
was so overwhelmed by a
work of art at the Prado
Museum, that she literally
feinted! I tell no lie.

And the food. A gour-
mand’s delight, a smorgas-
bord ranging from squirrel
and octopus to baby spar-
rows. Where else but Spain?

And for those of you
who’ve not answered our
letters, get with it, or expect
no gifts from here. We send
our bestand miss you greatly.

Bob and Caroline Price,
and all you racquetball afi-
cionados, knock yourselves
out. I’ve cashed in my rac-
quet for a matador’s cape.

We’reenjoying beingin -

a city as culturally rich as
Madrid. In our theatre class

Assistant Coach Ingram Responds

There are two possible
ways of dealing with an un-
pleasant situation: 1) Play
downits importance, ignore
it, and hope that everyone
will in time forget it. . . or 2)

Address it, present your side

of the story and run the risk
of igniting a fire unnecessar-
ily. My personality doesnot
allow me to ignore it and
hope that it will go away so

There has been much
criticism dealt out with re-
gard to Coach McKillop’s
handling of the final home
basketball game against
Campbell University the
20th of February, 1991. It
has been stated that Coach
McKillop displayed a disre-
gard for the two senior

members of his squad! That —

hedidnotrecruitthem, so
why should he care about
them! That he is sacrificing
seniors and juniors for the
sake of his younger players!
That he is sacrificing victo-

down the road! That the
