WHO’S THE SHREW?
Jennet Robinson explains her role.

‘Shrew’ And Companions

Describe Taming Progress

Staff Writer

If cast enthusiasm has any-
thing to do with it, “The Tam-
ing of the Shrew” should be
outstanding. At least, that’s the
impression given by the play’s
three actresses. Jennet Robin-
son, Bobbie Blackwood, and
Martha Taylor could not con-
ceal their delight when asked
about their roles.

Of course, the natural first
pauestion about roles is, ‘‘Jen-
fnet, were you type-cast as the
fshrew?” Luckily, she warned
ime beforehand that that question
was already more worn than
why would you (a girl) come
/to Davidson?” However, she did
confess to having some sym-
pathy for Katherina.
| ‘Kate’s shrewishness was
|weally sort of a defense mce-
hanism,” she said. Everybody

This year’s college blood drive,
reduced from two days to one,
will be held next Wednesday.
Donations will be taken in
Chambers Dining Hall between
the hours of 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.

Last year a total of 411 pints

of blood were given in the
spring and fall drives, an
amount which qualified the

school for the group blood plan,
which provides free blood pro-
tection for the entire student
body, administration, faculty,
and community.

In order to win such protec-
tion, it is necessary for at least
40 per cent of the student body
to give blood during the year.

The figure was barely met
last year, and speculation is that
the required minimum may not
be reached this year if the trend
toward continually lower giv-
ing holds true this year.

The decline is attributed in
part to the decreasing number
of students enrolled in ROTC
drill and physical education
classes.

For reasons of declining don-
ations and rising expense, the
drive has been shortened to one
day.

was always putting her down
and picking on her, so I under-
stand why she acted that way.
Really, Petruchio was the only
one who came to see the real
Kate.”

Bobbie Blackwood, who por-
trays Kate’s little sister said,
“Bianca isn't stupid, either.
She's really an expert at play-
ing the game with her suitors:
she can be herself with anyone
except men.”

Martha Taylor said that the
widow whom she plays is some-
what of a shrew, too, especial-
ly with the added experience
of already having been = mar-
ried.

All three of the actresses re-
emphasized the fun that the cast
was having with the play and
their high hopes for success.

Seeret Service Under Nixon
Recalls Brown Shirt Era

AN ANALYSIS
By ROBERT TOUCHTON

Asst. Managing Editor

A word used extensively to
describe the last, turbulent de-
cade comes crashing to one’s
mind when the spectacle of last
Friday's Brown Shirt meeting
(otherwise known as the pre-
sentation ceremony at Charlot-
te’s “Billy Graham Day”) is
contemplated.

That word is ‘‘sick.”

That word, which finally came
to be used as a part of the de-
cade’s numerical designation, is
apropos when one considers the
exclusion from a public event
honoring a minister of another
ordained man—a_ professor of
religion — because he questions
why some of his students
are barred from. seeing their
President.

The professor was Alexander
J. McKelway; the students were
Mack Mitchell and Jeff John-
ston.

The sad state of affairs into
which this nation has slid is
aptly illustrated by the simple
fact that McKelway, who sports
a theologian’s beard, had no
ticket yet entered the coliseum
along with the crowd while
Mitchell and Johnston, who bore
valid tickets, were barred be-
cause of their longish hair and
obvious occupation.

As he was herded from the
coliseum by a cursing guard
for simple association with col-
lege students, McKelway shook
his head and said, ‘‘Incredible!”
several times.

He was more vocal Wednes-
day when time, rather than mel-
lowing his views of the incident,
had made him more determined
of the evils of the present ad-
ministration.

“What is going on is simply
crowd control by Nixon,” Mc-
Kelway said. To assure cooper-
ative crowds of ‘‘the people”
Nixon ‘‘systematically excludes
students,” according to McKel-
way.

Secret Service and local po-
lice claim ‘“‘intelligence reports”
from the area indicated that
students and other dissidents
were planning to take over the
platform and in other ways dis-
rupt the planned niceties.

McKelway brusquely dismiss-
ed those reports with the un-
qualified statement that ‘‘this
was a hoax.” If anything, the
professor said, the reports were
self-generated, maybe by the
informers themselves.

There are undoubtedly those
on every campus who attend
various meetings and then re-
port the activities to govern-
ment officials. Frequently, the
informers suggest radical ac-
tions and then report that such
events were ‘‘discussed.”

But, says the skeptic or the
politically naive, the Secret
Service wasn’t at fault; rather

_the “redneck” local police are

to blame, right?

McKelway called the Secret
Service Nixon’s ‘‘political hench-
men.”

‘Increasingly, the Secret Serv-
ice is operating as a_ political

agent of Richard Nixon—some-
thing like the Brown Shirts of
Hitler,” said McKelway, draw-
ing on the experience of press
writers with whom he_ spoke
and recent reports from Wash-
ington on the political activities
of the S. S.

At least the Brown Shirts were
civilian supporters of Der
Fuhrer. The Secret Service is a
civil service branch of the gov-
ernment whose members’ Sal-
aries are paid by taxpayers.

When a president decrees that
he be seen by only a percentage
of the populace—the percentage
that either consider him a good
president or are too uneducated
or too foolish to know the dif-
ference — there is something
wrong with a nation’s sense of
values and propriety.

When civil service employees
become political thugs of a cal-
culating president, there is pre-
sent the harsh reality that
things aren’t as they should be.

And when respectable mem-
bers of society are hussled from
a public meeting starring their
President because they decide
to pursue the rights of those
excluded from the same event
because of their hair length or
present condition of servitude,
there is a word which describes
such an event.

That word is “sick.”
