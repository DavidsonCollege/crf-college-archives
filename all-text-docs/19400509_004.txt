SPRING SPORTS

To give credit where credit is due, we wish to inform one
and all that last week’s column was written by Master Robert
Williams, yours truly being away ona baseball jaunt through
the Carolinas.

Now that the time has almost arrived to hang up
cleats, gloves, etc., it seems appropriate to make a brief
resume of the won and lost records of the spring teams.
Led by the crack tennis team, Wildcat aggregations have
compiled what is considered a successful season accord-
ing to Davidson standards. The netters have compiled a
remarkable record, winning ten and losing only oné, that
to Presbyterian College’s nationally famous team. Among
the Wildcat victims are Colgate, Ole Miss, Georgia, Wash-
ington and Lee and The Citadel. The netmen are now on
an extended tour through the North on which they will
meet some of Yankeeland’s finest teams.

Coach Pete Whittle’s tracksters, although hard hit by the
loss_of three keymen in_mid-season, have nevertheless compil-
eda winning-record, taking
both losses being by narrow margins, Last
to The Citadel could have been
cats had been at full strength

The baseball team with a record of eight wins and
eight losses is not exactly setting the world afire. How-
ever, considering the class of competition that the Wild-
cats face, a .500 percentage is nothing to be ashamed of.
Any team that faces the class of the Southern Conference
in Duke, Wake Forest, North Carolina, and Clemson, can
hardly be expected to win consistently.

The Wildcat linksmen have also compiled a winning per-
centage. -Every-memberof the team —has.fired consistently

INTRAMURAL DOPE

Looking over the intramural situation, we find a bitter
battle between the Kappa Sigs, S. A. E.’s, and Phi Delts, with
the latter holding a twenty-nine point lead over the second
place S, A. E.'s, excluding horseshoes and Varsity competi-
tion. Horseshoes, being the final item on this year’s list, will
no doubt decide the winner. But no matter, which fraternity
wins, they can say that they’ve been through the mill, -for
competition this year has been the keenest ever, and the fra-
termty that wins will know that they-ve been in a battle.

West seems to be running away with inter-dormitory
competition. With only one sport remaining, the West
steam roller has flattened all opposition, losing but one
game during the entire year, that being the first football

game of the season. If the West boys can keep Melvin

Means in line as their ace third baseman, they look like

a cinch to cop the softball title. We wonder why Coach

Shepard isn’t using Melvin on his varsity baseball outfit.

He and Jim Owens would make a hot keystone combina-

tion.

Changing the subject slightly, have you noticed Taylor,
Solin, and “Father” Parrish playing half-ball? “This is
an entirely new sport, and according to “Ooky” it will soon
vie with softball in intramural interest. The aforementioned
three will open their half-ball soon. So.watch for the open-
ing date and be on hand for the first lesson. That’s all. . °
