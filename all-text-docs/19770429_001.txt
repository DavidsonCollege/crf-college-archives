ip Duncan interviewed College
President Samuel R. Spencer,

tions concerning the college's

den, but deferred comment or
questions concerning legal and
opinion matters, preferring

reply to those matters. On

three-way telephone « conver-
sation between Duncan, Spen-
cer, and college Counsel Larry

Larry J.. Dagenhart, Counsel
to the College and a Davidson

Trustee, explained in detail .

the College’s dealings with Dr.
Ronald Linden.

“‘The political science de-
partment, Dean Johnston and
I interviewed Linden when he
visited Davidson.

Linden’s interview

When Spencer interviewed
Linden, ‘‘I gave him the
section of the Trustee By-
Laws dealing with appoint-
ments and tenure to read as a
basis for our discussion...we
discussed the fact that he was
Jewish. I discussed with him
the nature of the college as a
community with a Christian

commitment.

“First of all, I am directed
to do that by the Trustees.
And secondly, I felt he was
certainly owed a full discus-
sion of that,’’ Spencer said.

Spencer said that he and
Linden did discuss Christian
tenure in the interview.

According to Spencer, he
and Linden did discuss Chris-
tian tenure in the interview.

Spencer explained that. Lin-
den raised questions about the
policy and indicated no agree-
ment with it.

“But,”” emphasized Spen-
cer, “Linden did not express
his objection to the policy in
the terms that he later used in
his letter.

“After those interviews the
political science department
recommended Linden for the
job. We accepted that recom-

On Tuesday, April 26, Ke-
vin Shelly interviewed Dr.
Ron Linden by phone in his
Cranberry, New Jersey, home.
This is an exclusive interview;
Linden gave permission to use
this material in The Davidson-
ian and also said that he would
not be commenting further to
any of the media until the
\American Association of Uni-
versity Professors complete

their inquiry.
Kevin Shelly: Were you aware
of Davidson’s Christian Ten-

ure Policy when you came to ~

Davidson for your interviews

at the school?
Dr. Ron Linden: ‘‘Ah, no.
Before I came down I was not
aware of it. At no time when I
was interviewing anyone in
the department was I aware of
it. Until I spoke with the
President...the information
about the stipulations came to
me from the President, not the
members of the départment.”’
S: In what form was the
information given to you?

L: ‘In the written. statement
af the college. My ‘recollection

is hazy, but typically what
happens is before a person
comes down for an interview
they send a person a package
which includes a lot of infor-
mation about the school, in-
cluding that statement. Now
this was not done in my
case....I don’t know why.
When I got there it was given
to me...I arrived on an eve-
ning and the next day was
spent in interviewing. I think
the package was given me that
first evening and someone said
to me that I might want to
take a look at the By-Laws. I
came upon the key chapter, I
think it is paragraph 5...and
then the President in his
discussions with me redoubled
that by discussing my religion
with me, and by giving mea
copy of the By-Laws.”

S: What was your initial
reaction when you came to
that section in the By-Laws?
L: “I was first of all confused.
I wondered, whether this was
just the kind of by-laws one
sees often written about a
school, that a school often has,
but which are relegated to its
library. I didn’t know whether
they were presently operative
or not. When I began to realize
that they were operative, that
was in my interview with the
President, my reaction was
‘I'm surprised’ —astonish-
ment.’’

S: Did you express that to
Spencer at the time?

L: “No, I didn’t say much of
anything.”

S: Why not?

L: “Before the interview I had
read the By-Laws, but I
wasn’t aware of what they
meant.”

S: What form did your discus-

sion with Spencer take in that ,

initial interview?

L: ‘‘We talked &bout a lot of
different things, things typ-
ically discussed in an inter-
view...my educational back-
ground, what I wanted to do
at Davidson. Asking me what
my nonprofessional interests
were, and after we discussed
fatherhood, my imminent
fatherhood, the President at
some time asked me after that
what my church background

political science job in a letter
dated February 9. He said, in
part, “It is part of my respon-
sibility to point out to you in
this letter the Statement of
Purpose of the college.

By-Law copy

“A copy of this Statement
together with a copy of the

section of the Trustee By- '

Laws is enclosed herewith. As
you know, Davidson is a
Presbyterian college founded
by churchmen and continuing
in its relationship with the
church.

“Though it is non-sectarian
in its practices it has a basic
Christian commitment and or-
ientation. I understand and
respect the fact that your
‘orientation is different.

“However, you should ac-
cept the appointment offered
to you in this letter only if you
genuinely want to join such a
community and are, as the
By-Laws state, prepared con-
scientiously to uphold and
seek to increase the effective-
ness of the college as a church-
related college.

“I owe it to you in all
fairness to repeat the admoni-
tion that the Trustees’ con-
viction about the shared com-
mitment of the permanent
tenured faculty is very
strong:...”’

Similar statement

According to Spencer, ‘‘I
say a similar statement—ob-

action

viously not the same, since I
said ‘I understand and respect
the fact that your orientation
is different’ —in every _— of
appointment,

‘‘And I send a copy of the
By-Laws and the Statement of

* Purpose with every letter of

appointment.”’

In a letter dated March 24,
Linden stated that he accepted
the appointment, but indica-
ted his ‘‘strong opposition to
such policies (as Christian
tenure) as morally repugnant,
socially anachronistic, and
scholastically unwise.”’

He continued, ‘‘...during
my time at Davidson, I will
strongly support any move-
ment to eliminate such laws
and practices.’

Spencer consults

Upon receiving this letter,
Spencer consulted legal ‘coun-
sel. “‘I myself didn’t interpret
the letter as a negation of the
contract,’’ Spencer pointed
out. ‘I asked the counsel if the
letter was an acceptance of the
terms of the contract.”

Dagenhart explained that
the By-Laws impose a duty

upon the President that he

must be certain that all candi-
dates for appointment are
aware that they must ‘‘uphold
and seek to increase the effec-
tiveness of the college as a
church-related college.’’
‘‘There is not much of an
alternative in the responsibil-
ity put upon the President by

The Student/Faculty Task
Force Concerning Religious
Requirements for Tenure met
Wednesday night to review
the case statement detailing

1. It confuses the issue of
Christian commitment with

2. It is unwise from an
academic point of view.
