Freshmen Athletes To
Receive Monograms Soon

D. C. to be Awarded to First Year
Men Making Teams in Major
Sports

At a meeting of the officers of the Athletic
Association last Monday it was decided that
the Freshmen making the team in either of
the four major sports, football, basketball,
baseball, and track, would be awarded a
monogram, a four inch D. C. This should
be a great incentive to the first year men to
work hard for places on the teams. It will
be an award for hard work and will show
the Freshmen that their work is appreciated.
The other colleges having the first year rule
all have some way to recognize the Fresh-
man teams and it is proper that Davidson
should take this step.

Prof. and Mrs, Lingle attended the
funeral of Mrs. Carrigan, Prof. Lingle’s
first cousin, last Sunday, at Thyatira
Church.

a meaning which has seemed hidden before,

our present-day questions.

Mr. Curry sees Christianity as standing
for at least five things, some of which we
have almost lost today. These are: Spirit-
ual over against material, in ‘viewpoint, in
philosophy, and in reliance; way of forgive-
ness, peace, unity and oneness with God;

economic and political justice; redemption of
the body—gifts of the Spirit. Have we

Can the Church be brought back to the true
religion, of Christ, or will the Reformer
again have to break with the Church? These

are thought-provoking questions, at least.

the State championship, this year.

Stanley Shows Power
Of Muscular Control

Variety Features Entertainment by
Muscular Control Expert

“Eleven and a half inches chest expansion
with breath exhaled, stretch neck six inches
and legs 14 inches beyond normal,” said S.
L. Stanley, physical training instructor and
vaudeville performer, and proceeded to
demonstrate it.

Mr. Stanley is making a tour of the col-
| leges of the country and kindly consented to
| give his lecture and exhibition for the bene-
fit of the R. O. T. C., in Shearer Hall. There
were no charges but a voluntary contribution
was given in return for his services.

Mr. Stanley has developed himself from
a sickly child at the age of 12 to his pres-
ent physical state by a method initiated and
perfected by himself. He performs 43 feats,
any three of which he challenges any man
in the world to surpass.

His first remarkable feat was a demonstra-
tion of muscular control of the neck. He
caused his neck to merge so completely that
it rested on his shoulders and then stretched
it six inches. He could throw practically
every joint in his body out of joint, includ-
ing hip, shoulder, wrist and vertebrae of the
spinal column,

Demonstrating muscular control of the
limbs, Mr. Stanley compared reaches .with
Captain Hearn, and in spite of the fact that
the Captain had 12 inches on him normally,
he would fot give up until his finger tips ex-
tended beyond the Captain’s.

“Put your mind:.on it” was his slogan.
“What's the use to move your muscles if
you don't know it? You'll be a flabby au-
tomaton, Quit taking pills for aches and
pains and give the old stomach some exercise
besides digestion.”

A laugh went up when in response to his
call for a belt that he could not break with

his abdominal muscles, Logan Lovelace ten-
dered an exaggerated elephant collar about
three inches across. All unconcerned he
punched a hole ,for the buckle by pressure
across his waist and burst it without ap-
parent effort. At least one man had another
sort of laugh then. It is no longer a mystery
how Samson did it nor why Stanley has long
hair.

From this he went on to show how he
could control the pulse in his arm at will, not
to mention lifting “Buffalo” McKinnon’s 260
pounds and worming away from a double
body scissors by Lindamood and Patterson,
Davidson's heavyweight wrestlers.

Mr. Stanley is of average height and
weighs only 142 pounds. “You don’t need
big men,” he says. You need men with prop-
er muscular development. Put your mind on
it. You don’t need’a gymnasium. A broom-
stick is as good as a hundred pound dumbell
if you put your mind on it and put a hundred
pounds worth of effort behind it.

Freshmen Class Will
Finish Athletic Field

Class Votes to Complete Work on
Freshman Field

At a recent meeting of the Freshman class
it was unanimously voted to complete the
work on the athletic field just in the rear of
the main field. There is only a small stretch
of land running the entire length of the field
that was left unfinished on account of a lack
of funds. Coach Younger, seeing it would
be impossible to secure any money to com-
plete the field, as a last resort called on the
Freshmen and found them willing, every
man voting to finish the field. Although it

is only a small section, to have a contractor

to do it would require several hundred dol-
lars, and the members of the present Fresh-
man class will enable them in about an hour
of good hard work from each man, to put
the ficld in decent shape. No grading or
skilled labor will be required since there is
nothing but sticks and small brush to be
removed, :

The class has been divided into four sec-
tions according to alphabetical order. The
first group, approximately one-fourth of the
entire class, will begin work Monday after-
noon at 3:00 o'clock. Tuesday afternoon
the next group will work the same amount
of time, and so on. It is hoped to have the
work finished by Thursday afternoon. No
one in the class will be excused except those
who actually take part in baseball or track.
Since there are only a comparatively few

Over One Hundred Men
Enter Tennis Tourney

Play Begins Friday and Saturday to
Decide Men to Complete Team

T. F. Staley, acting for the Varsity tennis
team, has arranged one of the most extrava-
gant tennis tournaments ever attempted at
Davidson, and announces that the first rounds
of the tournament will be held either Friday
afternoon or Saturday. Over a hundred
men have signed up to take part in the
tournament, a great increase over the num-
ber participating in a similar tournament
last spring. ‘

A tournament will be run in the three
upper classes to determine a “scrub team,”
while a team representing the Freshman class
will be chosen from the Freshmen players by
an elimination tournament. These two
teams, a faculty team, and the regular Var-
sity squad will then enter the main tourney
to decide the champions of the college. Plans
for the contest are complete, and registra-
tions are now being received. A fee of 35
cents is charged for registration. All inter-
ested candidates should apply to Staley at
once. ;
