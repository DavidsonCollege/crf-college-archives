Quiet ....

The long awaited dormitory council is
at last in the process of formation. For a
long time we have thought that an iron-
handed council inspired by such incidents
as the Turnbull and Dendy affairs would
be unfair and unneeded, but even editors
sometime see the light.

In the last part of November, way back
before the uh ruin of Rumple was heard
of, the “Y" council and the fraternity
presidents met with Sam Hay, Dr. Cun-
ningham and Dean Bailey. At that time
they were asked if they felt that there
was a problem in the dormitories and if
they had any ideas. These student lead-
ers agreed that something should _be

done about the dormitories and that a—

dormitory council should be formed.

Since then, what with the exuberance
of spring, three doors have been burnt
in Watts, a skylight has been broken
twice, once because a boy was dared to
‘do it, and several gallons of.water have
been spilt. Money needed to repair
damage is a more or less minor thing in
_ such. incidents, but sinco things have
_vone on_for years, the cost has mounted
up. It has become a well established
tradition at Davidson to tear up every
available part of the dormitories.

That is one of the main aims of the
proposed dormitory council. To set up
a tradition in the opposite - direction.
Tearing up someone else's property is
not what Davidson men are famous for.

_.Not even a freshman would think of go-—

ing down to llugo’s and burning down

the door on purpose, or- of breaking one
of the store windows in Charlotte. but
just because it's a habit, damage to col-
lege property gocs on.

The council as proposed in a constitu-
tion drawn up by Hay will consist of
31 men elected by the dormitory floors.
These men will be pledged to keep down
disturbance and start a_traditiow of
order in the dormitories. Of this num-
ber, seven will be elected to serve as the
executive committee of the council. This
comunittee will have the power to impose
fines, campus, and remove from the dor-
mitories. A president of the council
will be elected by the student body. This
constitution is being gone over and re-
vised by the student council and faculty.

It is our opinion that the dormitory
council will help, rather than hurt, fun
in the dormitories. No student is going
to expect his room-mate to be an angel.
The idea is a good one. It remains to
be seen whether the student body will
elect men who will fill their jobs, and
will give it the backing necessary for its
success.

‘to the Editor ....
Dear Ed: ©

There was a splendid cooperation
on the part of the students in response
to the Sunday night visiting of the
faculty members last Sunday, and let's
hope that it will keep up. The stuclents
themselves will get the benefit from it
in the last analysis and have really’ been
missing out heretofore in neglecting this

important contact. with the Professors

and their families. It has long been a
Davidson tradition, and one that should

never be allowed to die out.

You really find out just what a
“reg'lar feller” the Prof can be outside
of .class, and these contacts, as Dr: Mc-
Gavock pointed out, will serve as your
tie with old D. C. when you have long
since ceased to know a student in col-
lege. There must be something to this,
clse why do the old grads keep coming
back to the Hill? 1t’s something like
going back to the old Home Town and
finding old friends still there. And
the ones who have established friend-
ships with faculty members in the past
during their college days are the ones
who feel most at home today. ;

For those who have not yet called
on their professors, let me assure them
that the conversations are not “above
their heads” by any means; nor neces-
sarily on the intellectual plane. Refresh-
ments (sometimes) serve to put the most
timid freshman at ease; you can’t talk
with a mouthful of food. .

The faculty are not above telling
“tall tales” and having their own share
of amusing incidents which have occured
in days gone by. A touch of home life,
although not your own, is always good
tor a fellow when gone from home as
long as most of us are.

Davidson has always been known as
a triendly campus, and this has been
borne out by the greetings to fellow stu-
dents and to strangers. Why should not

this be applied_to .our student-faculty——an_this-mystery -explor

relations as well? Why not_ cultivate

the_ friendship of those “whom - we
study (?) under? They have. shown
an active interest in this phase of, our
relations; it seems our opportunity to
respond and make the best of our time
while here.

Education Tomorrow ....
— “Tn an hour when the shadow of.violent
death is stalking our manhood, and every
man’s tomorrow may be his last, this living.
vital present day is the day of our concern.
1954+ seems more than a decade away, per-
haps because so many will be gone by then;
only for dreamers, we say, are those years
which lie beyond the dawn. And it must
be so. Because for us there are jobs to be
done, big jobs, hard jobs, jobs upon which
depend so many lives — that is why we for-
get the future. But there are other lives,
younger than those being gambled on the
battlefield, lives for whom. the dying die.
We. speak of tomorrow’s generation, of
those young men of today who will inherit
the world.” ,

The above quotation, written by Mon-
toe Bush, 42, is especially pertinent since
the college authorities have received orders
terminating the contract with the Army Air
Forces for training students. The possi-
bility of a break in Davidson’s service makes
students_and faculty alike unhappy. The
increasing difficulty of receiving in the ser-
vices training in all fields leads us to think
that the government looks on education as
secondary to fighting.

Since it seems that civilian college
training is the only way to avoid an-illiter-
ate generation, the idea of there being no
more Davidson is one that no one connected
with the college enjoys.

Black Market

by THOMAS K. COLLINS

While rambling through the works
of the best known poets when I was
on a short-visit over to the Phi
Beta Kappa Dormitory, where they
keep such stuff so that the moths
won't eat it, I ran across a poem
which [ thought might amuse the
readers of this column more than

the smut that, has gathered crown gl

the campus since the last edition of _

the Davidsonian. Anyway, with

apologies to Edgar Alien Poe, IL

give you "THE RAVIN”

Once upon a morning drowsy, I was
feeling somewhat lousy

Lousy, yes, but not as lousy as I've
oftén felt pefore.

When YCdinbed my auburn toupee,
“suddenly I -heard-a “whoopee”

Some hoarse fiend yelling, “whoo-
pee.” close beside my bedroom
door. .

The events of

minds of every-

happen to Davidson? Where is the
prophet who can answer that qties-
tion, and their answer will be suf-
ficient and complete. Already, we

Then the silken, sad, uncertain”
rustling of my shower curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantas-

Yes, my spine felt cold and prickly,

I repeated, ‘’tis a drunk.” A drunk

Some late gentleman entreating en-

One more drink I had, no more.

Just a little drop of whiskey, but
it made_my soul grow frisky

“Sir™ said I “or Lady maybe,” this
will soon become a bore

But the silence was unbroken, and
the plumbing gave no token

And the only word there spoken,
was the whispered word “Le-
nore.”

Now for the awards: This week's

Davidson E goes to Copeland's Dive

for the way they have kept the
school going—looking out first of all
for the good of the stadents.

The spirit of the administration
in keéping the school running is
characteristic of one that has been
here for quite a while. On Septeifi-
ber 1, 1917, The Davidsonian print-
ed, “In spite of the fact that The
University of Virginia and many
other schools have cancelled all in-
tercollegiate athletic engagements,
Davidson is to have a football team

-this season.” During the Civil War

the picture was much darker than
it is today. There were no graduates
in the years 1862, ‘63, '65, and 766,
and only one in the year 1864, Yet.
Davidson ‘kept going.

When you look back at it, the
mumbling and moaning and groan-
ing that was heard after the an-
nouncement was made that Chapel
would be held at 8:30 A. M. is some-
thing to be ashamed of. Maybe it
is human nature to want to gripe
about something, but it certainly
doesn’t help matters any. Listen to
this echo from another warperiod.
February 20, 1918, “At a meeting of

the student body fast Monday morn-

drill before chapel in the morning
instead of in the afternoon... Re-
veille will sound at 6:25 A. M. and
drill will begin at 6:45 and continue
until 7:40."

The Y, M. C. A. Vesper program
last Sunday -night was something
new in vesper programs. The ves-
per speakers are usually selected
and -invited -to Davidson by Dr.
Cunningham. Beak Bradley got the
idea, that we should have a deputa-
tion~from Union Seminary, and he
followed the idea through. It might
be a god custom to start! If an-
other group like Foreman, Fulton,
and_Williams can be had, I'm sure

‘it would be a good custom to start.

Bob Lubin and the Air Corps
showmen deserve a lot of credit for
the fine show they put on—"“working
in their spare time between 5:00
and 5:05". Lubin is a real showman
~—at his bestzin the Pantomine
Act.

Bravo for the revival of that old

custom of visiting in the homes of
the faculty on Sunday night. Dr.
McGavocks talk in chapel and the

‘system worked out and printed in

the Vespers. bulletin have brought.
rich rewards.

Ed Patterson *

for having the best Boarding house
on the campus. Roses go to Jim
Lowry for obvious reasons that we
won't go into. And finally Pin-up
congragulations go just a little late
to Joe Mayo. This is Tommy. I'll be
seeing you in store cases and shop
windows all over the: nation. So,
come in and call for THOMAS
