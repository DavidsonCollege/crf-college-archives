Baskets of uneaten food lined
table after table inside of Knobloch
Tennis Center after last Saturday’s
Inauguration and Fall Convocation
luncheon, prompting students and
parents to wonder what happened
and to complain about wasted food
and money. In total, between 650
and 700 lunches remained uneaten.

The leftover food went to three
Charlotte homeless shelters.

According to Jill Marcus °86,
who owns Something Classic, the
company that catered the event, the
event was originally planned for
4,000 guests. The final count, how-
ever, ended up at 3,300 regular
lunches and 100 vegetarian bas-

10 percent overage from the
College’s estimate, a standard
practice in the catering industry.
The resulting 330 dinners, for
which Something Classic did not
bill the College, explain in part the

Free Speech Board allows students to
express thoughts, raises controversy

By KRISTINA JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Students studying, eating or
hanging out in the Union within the
last few weeks have likely noticed
Just Peace’s Free Speech Board, a
new way for students in the
Davidson community to express
themselves.

The board was the brainchild of
Mac Cowell ’06, who shared his
idea of a forum for campus dis-
course on a chalkboard or similar
medium with Just Peace, a student
organization that fosters discussion
of current affairs, social justice and
issues of peace. Last year’s Just
Peace ~ co-presidents Jackie
Javerbaum ’09 and Erin Jaeger ’09
worked with Cowell’s idea for a
year and conceived a design for the
board.

alumni. She also said that several
people, not realizing that the meal
was seated, told her that they
attended the ceremony but chose to
skip lunch because they did not
want to wait in line.

Marcus, Ross and Marsicano
also noted that student attendance
was low.

“IT would have to be honest and
say that we didn’t get student
RSVPs,” Ross said.

According to Marsicano, only
half of the student body RSVPed to
the multiple emails that she sent.
Because so many students did not
respond, the College decided to
order 300 extra meals in order to
avoid turning away anyone.

“Tt was very important to Tom to
have the opportunity for students to

luncheon

Golberger ’08 and Ross White ’09,
obtained the Board from Physical
Plant and worked with William
Brown, Director of the College
Union and Coordinator of Student
Activities, and Tim Stroud,
Assistant Director for Operations
for the Union, to figure out the
board’s location and logistics.

The board enables students to
anonymously share their views on
a variety of important topics,
including the environment and the
death penalty.

“The purpose for the board is to
spread awareness and dialogue on
campus,” Goldberger said. “[Just
Peace has] been trying to come up
with topics around which to center
the discussion that we think are
important on campus and in the
world, but also fit with our main
themes of peace and social jus-
tice.”

The controversy of the Free
Speech Board’s topics has garnered

a variety of written responses from
students. In response to the board’s
recent topic of what students can
do to save the environment, some
students wrote earnest pleas to
their classmates to conserve
resources, while other responders
wrote less serious responses, such
as “Conserve water, shower with
someone.”

Students have been so respon-
sive to the board that Just Peace
moderators have to erase it on
Sundays and Wednesdays due to
the sheer volume of responses.

One writer questioned, “Should
free speech be able to be erased?”

“There can’t be speech if there is
no room to write,” someone
teplied.

Moderators also have to erase
the board to censor comments that
are laden with profanity or com-
pletely off-topic. For example, in
response to the board’s most recent
