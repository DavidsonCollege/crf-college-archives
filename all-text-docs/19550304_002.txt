The Georgia Group

In the current issue of The Christian
Century there appears an editorial con-
cerning the reports of the annual meeting
of the evangelism and social service board
of the United Church of Canada. The edi-
torial cites with praise the unusual em-
phasis in the reports on the active mean-
ing of evangelism in the life of the Chris-
tian.

Among the statements in the reports
The Century found one which said that
“unless believers in Christ and members
of his body, the church, mean business,
lead a new life, enter the strait way, wit-
ness boldly and know the indwelling love
and joy of the Savior, any formal record-
ing of conversions will add to our com-
placency and be more of a danger than a
help.”

In a sense this statement has been
borne out in the recent surging of in-
terest in voluntary prayer groups on cam-
pus, centering in the worship service held
each Wednesday night on the third floor
of Georgia. Many of us have been unable
to understand the overwhelming interest
in this informal and voluntary group led
by one senior psychology major. Davidson
for so long has been called a religion-in-
fested campus, and for so long the stu-
dents have been so apathetic to religion
and so opposed to the very mention of a
worship service, that many have found
this new interest not short of amazing.

No one can have the answer to the
‘upsurge in the prayer group. Many stu-
dents have shrugged their shoulders and
said simply that “God moves in a myste-
rious way.” Some have beef: a little cyni-
cal, and some hopeful that ‘the new in-
terest would mean a new meaning of faith
on the part of most students.

We feel that Harry Petersen’s en-
deavor has come as an answer to prayer
in fulfilling a basic need on the part. of
students here.

Too often in college we are tempted
to overdo the intellectual search for God
to an extent where faith is stifled in
reason. We hear of the “search for mean-
ing” and the “search for truth” and all the
other searches in which the college stu-
dent is especially involved. And often we
do-not realize that our search must have
an ending, that God is beyond our reach,
and that there is a point at which our
powers become nothing and we must lean
upon the truth of a God who has said
that in faith alone can come the meaning
of truth.

The writer to the Hebrews recorded.
that “faith is the substance of things
hoped for, the evidence of things not
seen.” It is when we come to realize that
faith is not knowledge, for it must reach
beyond knowledge, that we see the worth
of the evangelism of Georgia as a needed
addition to the reasoned deliveries of
chapel services, vespers and the UCM. We
go from a man-centered theology to one
which is God-centered, and in so doing we
have the experience of a man coming
upon an oasis in the desert.

It is as Kierkegaard said. We reach the
“end of the rope” of reason, lean upon the
Reality of God, and become “like the bird
which alights on a frail twig of a tree,
which may break at any moment beneath
its weight, and yet sings its care-free song,
knowing that it has wings to bear it up;
so the man who believes in Christ, though
existing in the midst of uncertainty, is not
tossed in despair, for he knows that the
wings of faith will bear him up when all
else breaks away beneath him” Perhaps
Kierkegaard spoke to Davidson as well
as to’the world in saying “Faith begins
where thought leaves off.”

How Liberal Are Our
Liberal Arts?

The recent action of the Bell Tele-
phone Company of Pennsylvania in send-

ding some of its executives back to col-

lege to get a liberal education focuses
attention on the liberal arts, and in par-
ticular, the liberal arts at Davidson.

Our college catalog states: “Insisting
on the training of the mind as the first
task of an educational institution, it (Da-
vidson College) seeks to impart.to its stu-
dents a knowledge of the forces which
have determined the pattern of our
civilization, thereby fostering the under-
standing which gives meaning and pur-
pose to the present?”

How well are we measuring up to that
statement? Admittedly, Davidson is far
ahead of many institutions with its re-
quirements for History, Bible, English,
Mathematics, Science, and Foreign
Language. But it may well be doubted
that the institution is really giving a
liberal education to its students.

Among other books Bell executives
read the Autobiography of Cellini, the
Wiad, the Bhagaved-Gita, Brinton's Ideas
and Men, and plays by Sophocles. These
books are on practically every recom-
mended reading list issued by liberal
arts colleges, yet few of them ever feel
the touch of a Davidson student’s hand.
A student may never read a great Rus-
sian novel if he is not enrolled in ad-
vanced Literature course, and unless he
is an Economics major he may never hear
the name of Thomas Mun mentioned.

One way to break through the walls of
our self-contained departments of study
would be to inaugurate a required course
in the Humanities or Contemporary
Civilization such as the program at Co-
lumbia College and other institutions.
Such a course would give the student a
much broader view of his cultural
heritage and introduce him very early in
his college career to men and ideas which
will be important througheut his course
of study. By cutting across departmental
lines, it could show the relationships be-
tween History, Economics, Government,
and Philosophy, departments which are
greatly affected by each other.

The program could supersede the
present required History course and
might be extended into a second year to
include studies in American civilization
and institutions. There would, no doubt,
be many difficulties in implementing the
program, but the advantages to be de-
rived from it would more than compensate
for the difficulties —M.A.C.

The Paperbacks

The inexpensive, well-bound and
printed Modern Library books that have
ministered for so long to the needs of
literate but penny-shy college students,
are now coming available in less expen-
sive paperback editions.

It’s a new paperback series for Mod-
ern Library (though titles are old) and the
first ten releases are big guns aimed at
all the competition in the field. Among
the new releases (which stands exactly
7% inches tall and 4 and seven-sixteenths
inches wide and cost 95 cents) are Crime
and Punishment, The Divine Comedy, The
Republic, Gulliver's Travels and compara-
ble giants.

We stopped by the Intimate Bookshop
the other day and listened to Paul Smith
tick off the list of paperback publishers
with whom the new Modern Library books
will have to deal.

“The English started it all,” he said.
‘Phe Penguin series is the oldest of the
paperbacks we carry. Simon and Schuster
probably rates as the father of the Ameri-
can paperback business. Oh, there are
others—Rhinehart has a series and
Double-day (Anchor). Knopf (Vintage).
Meridian, Evergreen, Viking and. Dover.”

What this means to book buyers is
that almost every great work of litera-
ture is available in the best translations
for less than a dollar. Paperback titles
numbering in the hundreds range from
Homer to Faulkner and include Dumas
and Darwin and Randall Jarrell.

The paperbacks seem to make every-
body happy. The one dollar Unpopular
Essays of Bertrand Russell have sold 269
copies in a year and a half at the Intimate
—a record not approached of course, by
any hard cover in the house.

The rest of the stock likewise goes
like hotcakes. The age of the paperbacks
is on us full steam; college students never
had it so good—Dally Tér Heel.

Even Though Regrettable:

Higher Tuition Necessary To
Maintain College Philosophy

When the spring comes to David-
son, it.is more difficult than ordi-
narily to escape the infection of
Graggism — either galloping or
sedentary. When the warm sun
tends to put a
halt to intensive
academic work,
it is rather easy
to think of the
pleasant aspects
of Davidson
~ rather than of

the seamy side.

This particular
- spring has re-

Williamson = corded the an-
nouncement that in the future the
tuition will be higher than in past
years. This is indeed a regrettable
change and many of the gripes
which some students have prof-
fered are well founded. Although
regrettable, this increase in the
tuition reflects proper thinking in
the face of a tough situation. It is
undoubtedly the only realistic ap-
proach. The administration is
faced with the constant problem
of meeting expenses, and it is ob-
viously their decision that this
increase must be made or services
would have to be curtailed.

NOT AN ECONOMY
SCHOOL

Davidson is not an economy
school. And it would be a mistake
to try to make it one. The aim of
the college seems to this senior
to be something more than that
which a city college would attempt.
We are not here to earn college
credits—not even to get a diploma.
The program of the institution

By MALCOLM WILLIAMSON

seems to be to provide a four-
year experience in intellectual,
social, and spiritual associations
that will pay rich dividends for
the rest of life. This sort of pro-
gram requires more than the mini-
mum expense, and its scope should
not be narrowed even as an ccon-
omy move.

In order to provide something
more than routine classroom in-
struction, the faculty must con-
tinue to consist of men with more
than the ordinary amounts of per-
sonality and character as well as
academic competency. Although
the college may have an advan-
tage in attracting such men be-
cause of its tradition and numer-
ous contacts, it cannot afford to
offer salaries that do not compare
favorably with those in high quali-
ty schools.

SPORTS

This policy of developing the
man who is prepared to live pleas-
antly and productively instead of
the man who is simply trained to
spit out historical dates or chemi-
eal formulae involves much more
than the class room. It involves
athletics. While attempting to
avoid the difficult problem of how
to finance the major sports, Da-
vidson now needs more tennis
courts and a playable golf course.
These are sports which we might
develop to such an extent that
they could achieve for the school
the reputation which we have
missed in the three major sports.
This improvement, as will the rest,
requires money and it is necessary
if the full program of the college

is to develop.

CULTURE

The development of cultural en-
joyment is very essential to the
program of Davidson. The Dublin
Players seem to be both well re-
ceived and quite enjoyable. The
Artist Series needs to provide us
with more really first quality at-
tractions. Such a program would
be anything but an economy move.

In the above paragraphs, a brief
attempt is made to show a few of
the reasons why Davidson should
and must spend more per student
than many other colleges. It is ex-
pensive to maintain a_ position
among the best. It may be that by
offering the extras of education
and charging what is necessary to
pay for them, some people will feel
that Davidson has broken from its
heritage as a church-supported
school operated for the enlight-
ment of Presbyterian children.

Because of the higher cost, it
cannot be doubted that many good
prospects are forced not to attend
Davidson. But the philosophy of
the college has always been to pro-
wide the superior training that is
never available to all; and this aim
should be maintained regardless

of the inevitable cost. Consider-

ing this fact, a serious obligation.

falls upon each student—to make
the most of this opportunity to im-
prove and to broaden himself. A
challenge is provided every dedil-
cated faculty. member — to offer
something of himself as well as
something from a text.

What Others Are Saying . ..

About Humanities, Segregation, and Intellectuals

The Imaginative
Grasp

Nathan M. Pusey, president of
Harvard, is disturbed aot the de-
cline of the Humanities in Ameri-
can universities. In 25 years, the
number of students in Harvard
has risen by more than a thou-
sand. But Humanities students
have dropped 300 in number.

That statistic is repeated, more
or less, at most universities, this
one included. And why is that
bad? Let President Pusey answer:

A college in which the studies
traditionally called the Humanities
are weak runs the risk of being
less liberal than it should; for our
full humanity is best quickened
and developed through imegina
tive grasp of the subtler experi-
ences of individuals as revealed
through arts and letters.

The chief aim of undergraduate
education is to discover what it
means to be a man. A college
or university will be strong, there-
fore, only where those studies
flourish whose principal value is
to arouse such awareness and
where they are taught with charm
and vigor, and win respect.

—Daily Ter Heel.

Emilygration

The Haverford College sociol-
ogist, Dr. Ira Reid, speaking on
the problems of implementing the
Supreme Court Decision on segre-
gation, struck ao vibrant and
troublesome string when he spoke
of “patterned evasions.”

“Patterned ‘evasions” are not
limited to proposals to abolish the
public school systems, to attempts
to fight integration by elaborate
paper work—all the typical by-
ways being invented in quarters
openly hostile to the decision.

There is another, deeper and
deadlier “patterned evasion.” And
Dr. Reid touched briefly on that
evasion when he mentioned those
who make their tolerance of

ARNOLD

minority rights a matter of eti-
quette or “democracy.” For them,
as the sociologist said, racial jus-
tice becomes a matter of shaking
hands gracefully; or of sitting be-
side a member of a minority race
in a classroom because Emily Post
would perhaps approve. —

From Dr. Reid’s remarks, we
can gain this: Compliance with
moral obligations may become as
false, as perfunctory, as doctrinaire
as defiance.

The picture of racial justice we
lay before the peoples outside our
own boundaries will stand .on
weak legs if our actions are but
doughfaces for attitudes which re-
main unchanged.

Prejudice, diluted and concealed
by a thousand pages of Emily Post,
covered by procedures followed
only because they are “noble” or
‘democratic,” is still prejudice.

—Daily Ter Heel.

With Association
It May Be
Contagious

“Intellectual—a kind of poison
which with association may be con-
tagious.” Could the last part of
this definition be a saving grace?

Mr. Webster says that intellect
is “the power or faculty of know-
ing as distinguished from the
power to fee) and to will; esp., the

power of reasoning, judging, com-:

prehending, understanding” and
that an intellectual is one “en-
dowed with intellect.” From this
it may be said that each of us is
an intellectual.

Perhaps intellectuals are more
like plain students than plain Hol-
lins students think. And if they
are complicated ones, different, is
that really bad? The irony of the
whole thing is that we are all in-
tellectuals about something. If
you are one about basketball
strategy, why look with resentful
distrust at somone who is about
quartets or French Renaissance

literature?

Continuing in this line we each
then have something to give...
with association it may be con-
tagious. A poet writes poetry in
order to understand his own life,
and because he is human gives
insight to all human life. The
artist performs a means of release
to the viewer for pent up thoughts
and emotions, and the writer is a
translator of the thoughts and ideas
of his time, a sensitive interpreter
of moods, one who creates the en-
joyable, delightful, and sometimes
the shocking. Each of us has a
bit of the artist, the poet, and
the writer in her make-up. Each
is an interpreter and recomposer.

. Just the phrase “college atmos-
phere” implies contact with peo-
ple inquiring and interesting—
beneficial contacts which serve as
stimuli. It implies a collection of
people who are constantly question-
ing, trying to find the answers. But
a student at Hollins when she has a
question or when she thinks she’s
found an answer 1s afraid to voice
it. She may be accused of having
some intellect—an accusation tan-
tamount to vilification.

The person who can make us
feel what we haven't felt, see what
we haven't seen, and understand
what we haven't understood is a
friend. If she knows more than
we know about something, that
is an invitation to us, not an in-
dictment of us. And it is not on
indictment of her either.

RACKS

IN THE

LOISTER

By LEIGHTON MeCUTCHEN

The Human Predicament

Four yeors gone, and in retro-
spect, there is the stark fact of
ideals unrealized, of goals not
reached, of possibilities not
actualized. Who of us hasn’t felt
this frustration, whether looking
over long periods of living, or re-
thinking a single day. It seems
that we are always haunted with
the imperfection of our living;
with the rudeness of the gap be-
tween word and deed.

SOUND FAMILIAR

Certain ideals of good
scholarship come to most of us at
Jeast fleetingly during our stay
here—a well disciplined study
habit, a mastery of material, the
competent handling of significant
ideas—; all this ending so often
in the cry “I should have done
better, but...”

Or again a Y cabinet with high
goals of service and devotion
realizes abruptly that a lot of talk
has produced just more talk. Or
a student council which has some
concept of the ideal bases on which
to found a student community pro-
ducing mature individuals never.
theless is willing to take second
best because these ideals have been
broken time and again in the past
by actual student living.

Or note the feeling of decaying
incompleteness as persons realize
that again and again they have
broken their highest personal
goals, have resolved to do better,
but have foundered again; failure
to win in competition, failure to
live as we ought, ete...

WE ARE ONLY HUMAN

But mister writer, you are just

BILL SCHOLL:

expressing the human predicament.
As humans we know and desire
goals that are higher than we can
ever produce. Therefore take your
ease. Just reduce your goals and
be realistic. That will ease your
anxiety, and will keep you from
being neurotic.

Wise words those. And yet
haven't the most creative leaders
of the human race been those that
did long after this perfection, this
escape from the human predica-
ment of frustration? Some people
claim that one person actually did
live a life of fulfillment. That
one really did actualize the highest
possible goal in down to earth
flesh and blood.

WORDS INTO DEEDS

They claim that the Word—the
logos or expression of God him.
self — actually became man _ in
answer to the fruitless quest of
man trying to live out the word
in his own strength. Not only that
this one broke down the dividing
wall between ideal (word) and fact
(deed), but that he is now break-
ing down that wall in specific
instances through his men here
on earth,

Can then Christians be perfect
people? Again a sharp no. But
when these people condition their
goals and ideals by this Word made
flesh, it moves them on in. the
path of the realization of true hu-
manity. They can feel rested, and
yet vearn after perfection with a
creative fervor. Maybe this is
what “. . . reconciling the world
unto Himself means.”

MIND AND SOUL?

Once upon a time there was a
Hittle boy. When he grew old
enough in years, this little boy—
we'll call him David—went to col-
lege. Now, when he got to col-
lege, he was wise enough to see
what direction his course should
take. He knew clearly that in order
to win friends and influence peo-
ple he would have to amass a
certain amount of knowledge.
Along with this, of course, he saw
that he would have to shed many
of his former Christian inhibitions
and free himself from the
Nietzsche—termed slave morality.

Many of the things taught him
dealt with this matter of how to
— get ahead. His
study of eco-
nomics showed
that, after all
was said and
done, a man did
have to look out
for himself; his-
tory was pre-
sented, not from
a Christian
Scholl perspective, but

as a conglom-
eration of people, dates and events;
math and science taught him what
a wonderful series of cause-effect,
inter-related events had occurred
and would occur in the material.
istic age to which science held all
the answers; ROTC gave him
ample opportunity to assert: him-
self and relieve his wonderings
about basic security.

a...

All along, he was surely thank.
ful that he was being taught in
all his courses from an open-
minded. perspective, and not from
any particular point of view (this
was a Christian college). Religion

courses? Well, of course he had

them; but they were just other .

courses and, in spite of them, he
got along well.

And through the years he saw

how great a truth the intelligentsia
had—not by saying that the mind
was God-given and should be_used
to direct the whole body, but by
saying that really the mind was
all you needed, that a smart man
could do anything. His confidence
in himself kept growing. If only
he could always have self-control
by his mind! if only he were al-
ways man enough to keep out of
the slave morality, to keep from
developing deep feelings along
with deep thought. Sissies cried
when they saw children growing
up without knowing what “tree”
means, or Negroes being mis-
treated, or general exploitation of
people—he just thanked his lucky
star that he was smarter than all
that. Why take the world’s cross
when you can have your own
Cadillac? Passions, feelings—these
were to be crushed and kept under
control to the point of annibila-
tion by the mind; in the Spring,
you think of new ways of harness-
ing water power to force another
man out of business; you don’t
stop, reflect, and thank God for
water.

So this fellow—this David—
graduated. He had the ‘ability to
use the skills which he had
learned; more important, he could
manipulate people much more
easily now. He was well on the
way to being a success. Of course
some of his classmates had dif-
ferent ideas, but by and large
most of them were smart enough
to see with him thet, after all,
Protagoras had it when he said,
“Man fs the measure of all things.”
And, of course, you had to meesure
things in terms that don’t let you
go overboard for anything but
create emotional sterility by in-
intellectual rigor, terms of self-in-
terested power.

And David had a son, who of
course, followed him. Some say,
like’ David’ son, like fether.
