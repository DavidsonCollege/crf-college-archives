Davidson Exhibitions will be
displaying sculptures by one of
the Southeast’s leading sculp-
tors, John Kehoe, until January
29th.

A Professor of Art at the
University of Georgia, Kehoe
has become an authority on

Kehoe Uses Lost Wax Process
To Cast New Bronze Sculpture

bronze casting. The main sub-
ject of his Gallery Talk last
Thursday dealt with cirepedue
or the lost wax process of
casting bronze.

Kehoe is quite concerned that
the craft of cirepedue may be
becoming a lost art. He pointed
out that foundries all over
Europe which still employ this
ancient technique are closing

Irwin Allen and John Guillermin’s
“Towering Inferno” gives Fred Astaire
and Jennifer Jones something harmless
to occupy themselves with now that his
dancing career is over and her box-office
appeal has dwindled to what it always
should have been.

However, William Holden and Paul
Newman, who can act, deserve better.
Mark Robson’s ‘‘Earthquake”’ is hardly
an innocuous movie, but it does offer the
sight of Ava Gardner at age 52, and she is
a woman worth keeping our eyes on at
every stage of her life.

She looks like a great actress, which
must put her at least a third of the way
toward actually being one.

Unlike Robson, Guillermin, who direc-
ted the allegedly ‘‘dramatic’’ sequences
in “‘Towering Inferno,”’ does not seem to
have encouraged his actors to embarrass

’ themselves, although the ones among
them who are sensitive to the differences
between a good script and a rotten one
seem miserable all the same.

There are no dreadful performances in
“Towering Inferno;’’ there are at least
half a dozen in “Earthquake.” Strangely
enough, Steve McQueen and Walter Mat-
thau seem to thrive on disaster garbage;
McQueen is competent as usual in
“Towering Inferno’’ while Matthau
works a hilarious cameo turn in ‘“‘Ear-
thquake.’’

To make a disaster. movie about
devastation is to indulge in more unity of
form and content than is, strictly

Necessary.

Frenzied movies about frenzy, roman-
tic movies about romanticism, erotic
movies about eroticism, violent movies
about violence, and frightening movies
about horror I can understand, but
disastrous movies about devastation are
a bree which even my rambling
aesthetics cannot embrace.

“Earthquake” does not manage: to be

perfect even in its awfulness--unlike
another recent movie about devastation,
“Chosen Survivors,’’ which manages to
find some integrity on the level, as a
seeming experiment in badness.

At first, ‘“Earthquake”’ promises to be
the most offensive movie since ‘“The
Exorcist,” but a few redeeming qualities
mitigate the effect, and my choice for

rudest film: of 1974 must remain with

‘“‘Memories Within Miss Aggie.”’
“Ba e’’ merits an honorable
mention, however, along with ‘Airport

1975,’’ a film I am especially peeved with
because I happen to respect Gloria Swan-
son.

The worst folly of ‘“Earthquake’”’ is its
“sensurround,”’ a process which makes
the viewer’s diaphragm and ribs vibrate
and his ears ache, and accordingly
leaves him feeling sickish afterwards.

The greatest compliment I can pay to
“Raw Meat”’ is to report that when I
stood up to leave at the énd, I felt. like I
was going to have to vomit.

The suspense was so strong and the
horrifying jolts so jolting and the make-
up so convincing that the film had a
physical effect upon me, but it did this
through aesthetic means, which are very
dear, rather than physical ones, which
are cheap by comparison.

‘‘Karthquake’’ cheats by going
straight to the viewer’s abdomen and
ears, while ignoring his emotions.

‘The film is most alienating when it
tries most desperately to be involving--
when it chunks down monstrous noises
from speakers specially installed in the
theater for the purpose.

As an acquaintance of mine has ob-
served, “the projectionist doubles as
machine-gunner.’’ Seldom have I been so
tempted to walk out of a movie. ‘‘Ear-
thquake”’ isn’t satisfied with boring the
viewer, it must also make him physically
uncomfortable.

In theory I suppose most any subject
matter ought to have potential for being
done well. \

Perhaps I shoud try to conceal my
prejudices against movies about
devastation, but when I ask what kind of
director or writer could be attracted to
material of this kind, the current influx
of examples does not indicate a very
reassuring answer. i

Needs within the more unstable mem-
bers of the film-going public--of course, I
speak here of the beaten majority—
rather than within artists call forth
movies about earthquakes, plagues and
bombings, so that the resulting works are
at best dreary should come as no sur-
prise.

In “‘Juggernaut,”’ Richard Lester, the
only reputable director of late to allow
himself to be dragged into one of these

things, is almost completely over~

whelmed by the banalities of the project,
as are most of the members of his cast.
This cast is not one of your democratic
conglomerations of anyone with a name
and a latent desire for an Oscar
nomination, like the cast of ‘Ear-

thquake” or ‘‘Towering Inferno,” but a

solid and pleasant cast.

Although Allen and Guillermin do
fairly well by ‘“Towering Inferno,”’ there
is little reason to suppose they should be
working in movies at all, much less in the
disaster genre.

If they have any genuine interest in
disasters, they lack the talents necessary
to express it. In allowing every decision
to be made on the basis of what the public
wants, Allen has made a film that is false
and hideous in its center.

His vitality as a producer is rather
awe-inspiring, and one wishes it could
someday be harnassed into service of a
director with vision and talent. This,

however, is not likely to happen.

down at a rapid rate.

However, he hopes that
schools and institutions such as
the University of Georgia in
Athens will be able to preserve
the art by. building and main-
taining their own foundries.

Kehoe presented slides
during his talk which actually
showed his work being cast by
the lost wax process at foun-
dries in Italy. Some of these'‘are
on display. They are generally
hollow cast.

Kehoe. believes that the tac-
tile sense is a very important
element in the appreciation of
his. work and encourages all
viewers not to hesitate to feel
each ‘piece; to notice the tex-
ture, the temperature, the
mass; and to enjoy the work’s
three dimensionality.

What is Kehoe’s sculpture
about? They are abstract and
highly conceptual, but are they :
successful?

Kehoe’s sculpture is abstract,
it is successful in many ways,
and is highly communicative
with the viewer.

It has been said that the struc-
tural patterns of all successful
art may be found existing in
nature on a microscopic,
macroscopic, or human level of
perspective. ;

The structural key to Kehoe’s
work for the most part (this is
not always the case) is the
‘human eye.

This ‘‘eye’’ orientation [
believe gives many of his works
highly symbolic abilities to
communicate and establish
themselves to the viewer. Jt.
establishes an organic vitality
in a naturally stable and secure
design. But e are problems.

Kehoe, by basing his work on
this structural pattern is hard-
pressed to break away from a
kind of. predetermined two
dimensionality. ;

In other words, just as there
is basically only one view of the
human head--the front, the
same is true for many of the
works on display. There is often
only one or two ways to view it:
the front or the back.

I believe that sculpture as a
three dimensional art should
fully exploit its  three-
dimensionality. Kehoe has
presented us with work that
could be communicated very
well byapainting. “

Regardless of the two-
dimensional aspects of Kehoe’s
works, I think they remain
very provocative, subtJe, and
‘intriguing.
