across River Joy, through Pleasure Park,
and many other places, which all visited
with enjoyment. At each place of in-

members, suitable for that place. A
quartet composed of Hodgin, Calhoun,
Garrison and Poole, rendered a song to
represent River Joy.

After this unusual and interesting pro-
gram, Forrest Franklin made a short re-
port on the work being done at the Mill
Chapel. He explained how 11 of the
Endeavorers could aid in that work, but
the biggest help would be to pray.

more, whom he may deputize, will out-
line the work for this year, as planned by
