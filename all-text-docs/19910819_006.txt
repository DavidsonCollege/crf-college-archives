Shades of Two Worlds : Allman Brothers Light

By Jim Carswell

Back in their heyday in the late
60s and early
70s, the Allman
Brothers — pro-
duced what many
would call some
of the best beer-
drinking music
around with al-
bums like Eat A
Peachand Live at
Fillmore East.
Since then,
whether outside
listening to “Blue
Sky” on a sunny
springtime after-
noon or dancing ata crowded party
to “One Way Out,” a lot of people
have enjoyed the Allmans with a
cold Miller or Bud.

This summer the band prom-
ised a return to its greatness with
the release of a new album called

Shades Of Two Worlds. To make
it, Gregg Allman and Dicky Betts
got to-
gether
with a
couple of
the other
original
members
and a
new,
Duane-
influ-
enced
slide gui-
tarist
named
Warren
Haynes. All the talent promises a
triumphant return, but don’t rush
out for a six-pack yet.

The slick production and unin-
teresting lyricson some of the songs
really limit the album. And the
shortcomings are apparent on the

Oh, Those Lazy, Hazy,

By Joe Maris,
Davidsonian film critic

Sadly enough, the formulaused
for this summer’s lineup matches
almost perfectly with previous
formulas from previous summers.

Therefore, before I presentmy
opinionsconcerning this summer’s
movies, I would like to uncusto-
marily project what I'm sure we'll
alladore from the Summer of 1992:

Perhaps another Kevin Cost-
ner movie: Costner plays God in /,
God. ,

And, if we're réally lucky, a
movie about a man awaking from
amental disease and rediscovering
the world: Harrison Ford plays the
debilitated Jesse Helms in Regard-
ing Jesse, a heartwarming tale
abouta politician who wakes up 65
years aftera brain disorder reduces
his intelligence to that of wet rock.

See if I’m not right.
And now, a brief review of this
summer’s movies:

Naked Gun 2.5: The Smell of
Fear. The important thing to re-
member when discussing this
movie is not to make apples out of
oranges. This second installment
of the "Police Squad” extravagan-
zas promises nothing more than
age-old slapstick and offhand jokes
and it delivers nothing more than
age-old slapstick and offhand
jokes.

Naked Gun 2.5 is funny. The
jokes are no. different than any
other comedy’s jokes, but the
beauty of Naked Gun 2.5 lies in its
courage to simply be funny and
nothing else. Too many comedy

movies try to mix things like people
getting run over by trucks in a
funny way with things like people
touching each other as spiritual
brothers in a universe governed by
love. Few find the effective mix. .
Naked Gun 2.5, therefore, gets a
bucket of stars for not trying,

Robin Hood: This movie has
several flaws that most other re-
viewers have pointed out. One,
Kevin Costner was terrible as
Robin Hood. His acting was like
the’sudden aching of a hypochon-
driac when the hypochondriac
realizes that he is not showing
enough signs of pain to draw
sympathy from his peers. Lay as
much blame on the script as on
Costner, but it seemed as if Cost-
ner was always suddenly remem-
bering that Robin Hood. is sup-
posed to be witty and care-free and
notat all like the American soldier
Saviour-Hero twit from Dances
with Wolves.

Two, the ending was terrible.
Itis obvious that Kevin Reynolds,
the “director”, was a chemistry
major in school.

Three, the villain was hilari-
ous, thereby creating a problem.
One simply cannot have a decent
story about good and evil when the
hero is as exciting as a bag
of salt and the evil-doer
captures the heart of the
audience.

When the sheriff does evil
things, they aren’t so bad simply
because he issofunny. Sadly, one
can’treally side with the bad guys
because they beat up children.

The end result is that the audi-

very first song, “End of the Line.”
While the rhythm section and the
guitarists create an interesting and
enjoyable song, the lyrics lack wit
and imagination. A song that re-
views the career of one of the more
colorful figures in popular music
would be worthy of better lines
than, “When I think about the old
days / It sends chills up and down
my spine / Oh, life ain’t what it
seems / On the boulevard of bro-
ken dreams.”

Gregg Allman hasn’ tlived that
terse and tired a life, has he? And it
only gets worse, when he follows
these lines with cliches like “kill or
be killed” and “king of the hill.”
The song does have some appeal,
though, and most people will find
themselves tapping a foot or'even
grooving a bit, if they ignore the
words. Actually, the whole album
is musically entertaining, if not as
raucous as their older material.

“Bad Rain,’ “Nobody Knows,” and
the instrumental “Kind of Bird”
recall some cf the band’s best
music, though these songs are just
a bit too well produced.
Whether due to technical limi-
tations or professional sloppiness,
older Allmans music was mixed so
ythat each instrument came on
strong. Jaimoe’s drums or Gregg’s
keyboards even seem to be per-
forming within each song on their
own little stages, competing for
the listener’s ear. Buton Shades all
the sounds the band produces seem
perfectly integrated. It sounds
professional, but the Allmans are
supposed to be a little more raw.
The album's two strongest
songs are “Desert Blues” and “Get
On With Your Life.” “Blues” rocks,
so that the rather silly (though not
cliche) words don’t seem that
important. Just listen to and enjoy
this one instead of paying attention

ence has no one to pull for unless
they are sympathetic to nauseating
dialogue or are sympathetic tochild
molesters.

Robin Hood fails miserably.
The director took a weak scriptand
tried to cover its weakness by us-
ing exciting camera angles, sym-
bolic old blind men and a plethora
of heartwarming lines stolen from

‘ other movies.
Bill and Ted’s Bogus Jour-
ney: People are sure to see this
_sécond installmant of Bill-and-
Tedness no matter what any movie
reviewer Says particularily if they
have seen the first one over 600
times. In some respects the second
Bill-and-Ted movie is better and
in other ways it is worse.

On the better side, the script-
writers delicately prove thatatleast
someone in Hollywood does not
consider Dead Poets’ Society the
best movie of all time.

Bill and Ted’s confrontation
with Death, particularily in the
Parker Brothers arena of sport, is a
clever parody of Ingmar
Bergmann’s The Seventh Seal in
which the protagonist plays a pro-
longed game of Chess with the
Grim Reaper. I was most righte-
ously impressed with this rather
bitchin’ allusion.

On the worse side,
however, it is painfully
obvious that the second

Bill-and-Ted adventure had
a large budget. Otherwise’ I can
hardly justify the use of a
Muppet-like creature

effects with which Bill and Ted

or -
justify Beetlejuice type special

expose their playdough sculpted
insides. Put the better and worse
together, however, and better
comes out on top. If the first one
was entertaining, the second one
persuadingly follows suit. It cer-
tainly could have been worse.

Terminator IT: Quite simply,’

this movie is great. It is true that
Terminator II is an Armold Sch-
warzennegger movie and that it is
filled to the hilt with witty, foreign
language one-liners and exploding

semi-trucks. This movie’sstrength, ~

to it.

Do pay attention to the other
one, though. It’s just the type of
blucs the Allman Brothers do best,
from the crying guitar to the lazy
keyboards to Gregg's yearning
voice. Truly, this song would have
gone very well on Brothers and
Sisters. It’s too bad they couldn’t
make the entire album like these
two songs.

Butit’s 1991, not 1971, though,
and these guys haven’t produced
very much good music, together or
individually ina long time. If you
like your collections complete, go
outand buy Shades OfTwo Wortds_
to get their best effort in a while.
But don’t get Miller or Bud to
drink with it. The album's un-
imaginative lyrics combined with
the sugar-coating of overproduc-
tion suggest that Coors Light or
even a Corona with lime would
better complement this album.

of Summer »

however (and it has an encourag-
ing amount), comes from two par-
ticular areas.

First, of course, are the special
effects. They are simply incred-
ible, Second, the story is solid and
actually manages to confront the
nuclear issue with a side-glance
rather than with direct The Day
After depiction.

The film’s great irony lies in
the use of the best special effects
to date to confront the problems of
a technological age.
