Discrimination Taints Union
Building Entrance Policy

To the Editor:

This letter is written as a
purely personal reaction to the
confused and shameful state
of affairs at the College Union

Recently, I have had oc-
casion ot observe that there is
a basic inequity in the use of
the College Union building by
non-college youths.
Specifically, I am referring to
the unofficial but nonetheless
real policy of allowing
professor’s children to use the
facilities, while other youths,
most notably blacks, are

Signs on the outside and in-
side of the building state that
only college personnel (i.e.,
students, professors, and
college employees) are per-
mitted to use the College
Union.

This policy is frequently en-
forced when a black youth
from the town attempts to use
the building, but I have yet to

Recently, two professor's
sons came to the Union asking
for permission to use the
building on a regular basis.
They argued that the
“‘townies’’ are riffraff not fit to
use the building, whereas the
academic show a
proper appreciation and
respect for the school’s
property.

This is pure and
unadulterated hogwash. First
of all, the school population
has for too long not considered
itself part of the town of
Davidson.

They are just as much
“‘townies” as the kids from

academic community. They

have a legitimate complaint
that there is a dearth of
facilities for the teenage
youth, both black and white, in
thie town.

It should be the respon-
sibility of the school, because
of its dominant position in the
town, to provide such
facilities.

All youths, both college and
non-college, should be per-
mitted to use building in
the absence of a separate
youth center.

What this letter asks for is a
measure of consistency. It is
up to the Union whether or not
it wants to permit more
lenient admission policies.

However, if the Union
decides on its current policy of
exclusivity, let that exclusion
hold for ALL le per-
sonel, not just for those whose
pedigree has an academic
deficiency.

The outgoing president of the Board
of Visitors could be forgiven for
having misspoken himself as he ad-
dressed a luncheon audience because
up until that moment, everything had
been coming up roses as he and
others praised Davidson to the sky
during the annual meeting of the
Board of Visitors and the Ne Ultra
Society this past Friday.

This was about the only somber note
sounded during the day which had
been set aside to let some of the more
prominent benefactors of the College
return to the campus to find out what
the latest developments here were.

It was only fitting that those on the
Board of Visitors, who are supposed to
represent Davidson College in their
respective geographical and
professional areas, and those in the
Ne Ultra Society, who have bought
themselves this honor by giving $5000
or, preferably, more to the College,
met in a combined meeting this year.

But it must be admitted that despite

Davidson, the speech was pretty good.
