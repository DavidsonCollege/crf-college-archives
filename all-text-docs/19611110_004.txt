THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1961

Sincerity Revisited

Monday in assembly, President
Martin digressed to speak at length
concerning THE DAVIDSONIAN and
a recent editorial (Can Davidson Be
Sincere?, Oct. 27). He intimated that
the paper was uninformed and tried
to illustrate this in a personal defense.

THE DAVIDSONIAN prides itself
in being an informed voice on campus.
We speak our opinions as clearly and
fearlessly as possible, but only after
we have sought full information when-
ever necessary. When we haven't, we
will gladly stand corrected.

However, we feel nothing was
said Monday which we need accept
as rightful criticism. In the first place,
the editorial referred to was. not a
personal attack on the President.’ It
was not necessary that he explain his
recent illness, preventing his partici-
pation in Dr. Peyre's visit. We were
aware of his illness; it did not affect
the truth or informed nature of our
statement “No major member of the
college family introduced him (Peyre),
accompanied him or attended his
addresses.”’

We were also aware that Peyre’s
visit was originally scheduled ‘for
later in that week, and had been

Pruning Campus

In sending out forms for the
evaluation of campus organizations,
the Student Council has opened up
investigation in an area which sorely
needs re-evaluation.

Many organizations will be hard-
put to explain their purposes. They
will have even greater difficulties in
relating their activities to the goals
delineated in their constitutions. Some
will be able to report no activities at
all.

The groups which have become
almost inactive include some of the
best-known and most venerable, such
as the literary societies, and some of
the lesser-known and younger, such
as the Beaver Club. These have be-
come mere names to fill those em-
barassingly blank spaces in the Quips
and Cranks and on graduate school
applications.

We can be grateful for these
small services rendered by our dead-
wood organizations, but we would
suggest that they are capable of do-
ing more. If they are not, they should
be retired.

A B-plus For ASC

The Facuity’s Committee on
Academic Scheduling released this
semester's exam schedule and the
1962-63 calendar this week, and we
think they’ve come up with some
pretty sound arrangements.

Although they have scheduled
two very heavy class hours for the
last day’s exams, they were only fol-
lowing the advice of the student body,
which, after all, favored a full eight-
day exam period. Well, most of us
will have it.

Next year’s calendar looks good—
it seems that the days of the week
fall into line almost perfectly next
year. Orientation will begin on a
Thursday, Sept. 6. There is no conflict
with Labor Day, and there is even
room for Freshman camp, say on
Tuesday and Wednesday. If Rush
Week is held as usual, it will conflict

sk)

scheduled since last spring. He was
asked to come earlier in the week
instead when the former days became
the only time that Dr. Cunningham
and Mr. Dana and The Board of Visit-
ors could all be on campus. The Fine
Arts Building had been ready for
dedication for several weeks.

We also knew Dr. Peyre was a
guest of honor at Wednesday night’s
“dinner party’ for the Visitors. That
was part of our point. He was a special
guest but he made no address; lip
service was paid a scholar but what
benefit. did. the body derive from his
knowledge? We do not feel that a
Slater System dinner, sponsored for
the Board of Visitors, has added sig-
nificantly to Peyre’s scholarly stand-
ing, but he could have added to ours.

We still feel it will be most mis-
leading to readers of our public rela-
tions information when they are told
that Davidson had Dr. Henri Peyre
on campus. That is, unless the attend-
ance figures are also provided and
they can draw their own conclusions
about the benefits derived.

The question still remains—Can
Davidson Be Sincere?

Deadwood

Other campus groups have be-
come sluggish. This form should prick
them to action by reminding them of
their purposes and forcing the officers
to take a hard look at the club’s
record.

The Student Council can use its
position to co-ordinate the activities
of the various groups, to encourage
their activities and to suggest re-
forms. The investigation should be
able to activate and invigorate David-
son’s extra-curricular life by putting
pressure on campus organizations to
live up to their own goals.

The council should also use its
moral influence to bring about such
needed reforms as the reduction of
the influence of sucial fraternities in
certain campus organizations.

We hope that the council will not
limit its study to the areas covered by
this preliminary evaluation form and
we hope they will not stop with this
investigation. Further study and ac-
tion should follow.

L. K.

with two less days of classes than this
year.

There will be a full ten days be-
fore Christmas, with the holidays
ending on Jan. 3. There will be a
three-day semester break, including
a weekend. Spring Holidays will in-
clude two weekends, plus a week in
between. All this, and school is still
out by the end of May. Commence-
ment is June 1 and 2.

The Committee has worked out
one of the better schedules we have
Seen since we've been here. True,
there is no reading period before
either exam week. Homecoming is not
set yet. But the major students gripes
were heard, and the causes eliminated
for next year. We hope a lot of new
ones won't crop up—right now we
don't anticipate many.

Frakes Terms Tillich A “Theological Giant”

BY F. VAL FRAKES
Assistant To The Chaplain
Paul Tillich, Davidson's sec-

ond Reynolds lecturer for the
year, is one of the philosophical
and theological giants of the
twentieth century. He is read
and studied, praised and criti-
cized in both Europe and North
America. With the exception of
Reinhold Niebuhr and Karl
Barth, no contemporary man
has so influenced American
theological students as has Til-
lich.

He, probably more than any
living Christian, has won re-
spect and attention from cul-
turea despisers of religion.
Many an intellectual, who con-
fidently assumed that he had
discarded religious faith with
his knee-pants, has recognized
in Tillich a thinker with whom
he must come to terms.

LUTHERAN BACKGROUND

Tillich was born in Prussia in
1886, the son of a strict and
authoritarian Lutheran pastor.

Although Tillich later rejected
the doctrinal rigidity of his
father, his Lutheran background
has left an indelible mark. How-
ever much his philosophy-
theology combines such diverse
elements as Greek philosophy
and German nature mysticism
(Schelling), he insists that Jesus
as the Christ is the standard for
understanding the meaning of
history and for arriving at theo-
logical truth. ;

His Lutheran boyhood is evi-
dent in his belief that physical
things (the cross, bread and
wine, a sanctuary) can mediate
the presence and holiness of
God and in his appreciation for
sarcramental and liturgical wor-
ship. Tillich was not moulded by
a puritanically plain and som-
bre Presbyterianism, which has
usually suspected vestments,
beauty, and drama in worship.

Tillich served as a parish
pastor and an ariny chaplain
(World War I) before settling to
the career of teaching philoso-

phy and theology in German
universities. While teaching at
Marburg, where one of his col-
leagues was Martin Heidegger,
Tillich was attracted to many of
the moods, themes, and terms of
existentialism. His thought has
continued to be marked by
them.
RELIGIOUS SOCIALIST

Following World War I Tillich
participated in a movement call-
ed “Religious Socialism.” Its
aim was to replace bourgeoise
society with a more just one.
Tillich agreed fundamentally
with the Marxian indictment of
capitalism—it was the primary
cause of World War I, he believ-
ed— although he rejected the
utopianism, extreme collectiv-
ism, and alleged anti-religious-
ness of Marxism.

Tillich's outspoken opposition
to Marxism necessitated his
leaving Germany—he was teach-
ing at the University of Frank-
furt—in 1933. Largely through
the efforts of Reinhold Niebuhr,

Waugh’s Council Takes
Long Time Perspective

BY BOB WAUGH
President Of The (FC

There is a saying which states

in part that you cannot please
all of the péople all of the time.
These words describe conciscly
the difficulty which the Inter-
fraternity Council faces in set-
“ting up its social calendar. If
you have ever had any personal
experience with trying, for ex-
ample, to get as few as ten
people to agree on something
which is a matter of individual
taste, then you can appreciate
our problem. .

With this in mind, the IFC
has taken a long range view of
this year's social calendar and
is endeavoring, through the
presentation of varied enter-
tainment on different weekends,
to bring groups which will be
enjoyed by all students at one
time or another.

CRITIQUE SESSIONS

After each dance or concert

LETTER TO

weekend, the  Interfraternity
Council holds a critique session
to evaluate the various aspects
of the weekend. That is, how
well was the dance or concert
atiended. what was the general
redction to the attractions, ete.
1. is with this critique in mind
that we go ahead and begin
planning future weekends.

There was an error in last
week’s DAVIDSONIAN in that
we have not cetermined wheth-
er or not Spring Frolics will be
a “rock and roll” weekend and
also the IFC has not decided
whether or not there will be a
dance on Saturday night of
Spring Frolies. Ideally, we
would like to wait to get the
general reaction to both there
not being a dance Saturday
night and the “rock and roll”
element of the coming dance
weekend, before we go ahead
with future plans.

THE EDITOR

Parent Commends
Paper On Press Rating

Dear Editor:

THE DAVIDSONIAN obvious-
ly deserves an “All-American”
rating by the Associated Col-
legiate Press. Congratulations
to you and the members of your
staff. Each issue receives a tap
rating by all of The Hetzels and
is eagerly read cover to cover.
Your newspaper helps us to
understand and appreciate the
college community better.

We are delighted with the
freedom of expression which is
afforded students through THE
DAVIDSONIAN. After attending
Parents’ Day weekend and con-
sulting with the extremely
erudite and hospitable profes.
sors we understend why the
students of Davidson College are
intellectually end fearlessly
vocal,

How fortunate are those stud-
ents to be able to attend “After
Vespers Open Houses” and par-
ticipate in informal conversa-

tion with their professors.

If your weekend meeting at
the ACP convention in Miami
Beech was only one-helf as won-
derful as our time et Davidson
College, you were richly re.
warded.

Thank you for giving us a
satisfying feeling of sharing in
our son’s new community. With
best wishes to all of those who
make your paper possible,

Sincerely,
Mrs. Fred Hetzel
Washington, D. C.

VARIETY EXPLAINED

For those of you who did not
enjoy the orchestras and vocal
group presented for the Home-
coming dances, we ask you to
have patience and remember
that there are students (a little
less than half of the fraternity
membership according to the
recent count taken around Pat-
terson fraternity court) who list
“rock and roll’ as their second
choice and who will be assessed
to help pay for the Midwinters’
“rock and roll” groups.

For those of you who do not
like “rock and roll”, we ask
you to remember the Homecom-
ing attractions, the cost of which
was shared by students who do
not enjoy this type of band and
singing group.

Yor those of you who have not
enjoyed anything presented (or
planned) so far, we ask you to
speak out for what you would
like.

CHOICES DELIBERATED

No matter who the IFC con-
tracts you may rest assured that
much thought and deliberation
has gone into the choice, so
please do not “close” your mind
to the attraction before it has
had a chance to come here and
perform.

Last year, ‘The Weaverg”
were contracted, and many stud-
ents, due to their own close
mindedness and arbitrary de-
cision that “The Weavers”
would not be worth a damn,
missed what turned out to be
one of the best concerts of the
year.

Lastly we want to ask you to
take advantage of the purpose
of your having an IFC represen-
tative. Tell him whether or not
you enjoyed the features of the
weekend and tell him what at-
tractions you want to see here
as a part of your social calen-
dar.

Union Theological Seminary
(New York) invited him to join
its faculty. He remained there
until 1956 when he became gen-
eral professor to the University
at Harvard.

Tillich is a scholar of scholars
—as much at home in philoso-
phy, psychology, history, or the
arts as he is in theology. He be-
lieves that the arts (music, dra:
ma, painting) play an extremely
important role in exploring and
describing human nature and
the “human. predicament. He
has paid close attention to the
work of depth psychologists
and frequently weaves strands
of their findings into his own
theological rug. He refers to
Freud frequently in developing
his doctrine of estrangement
(Sin). }
SINGULAR VOCABULARY
Listening to Tillich lecture is
a demanding task. He speaks
with a slight accent and requires

More important, he so often uses
words or terms in a unique way,
(or in a theological lecture he
often substitutes new terms for
what he believes are worn out
nd misleading traditional ones,
i g., estrangement for Sin,
Ground of Being for God.)

For instance, Tillich uses the
word “essential” not to describe
ithe essence of a thing as it is,
but to describe the essence as it
ought to be. “Essential man”
refers to man 4s he ought to be
—in perfect unity with God. Til.
lich uses “existential” as the
opposite of essential. It refers —
to things as they evist—in eg.
(rangement (Sin) from God,
“Existence” for Tillich always
carries the connotation of Sin
and estrangement. Hench. Til-
lich refuses to make the state.
ment, “God exists.” This is for
him an “impossible combination
of words,” implying that God

definite intellectual agility. Himself is estranged and in Sin.

Amateur Antigone Success
Captures Anouilh’s Power

BY DAVE DILLARD

Some had come merely tu be entertained, to escape
boredom. Others came to see their friends on stage. But
regardless. of purpose the 250 first-nighters who filled
Hodson Hall Wednesday saw Davidson's Vagabonds cap-
ture some of Jean Anouilh’s informal, blunt eloquence in
dealing with high tragedy.

By amateur standards the Vagabonds’ Antigone
was a success. Modern dress, plain stage decor, and a
theatre-in-the-round atmosphere gave the presentation
intimate directness. Despite some shortcomings, it com-
municated.

Walter Bost played an intense, mature Creon. He
set a high standard of performance, showing remarkable
character empathy. In the title role, Luckey Husky of
Queens College created a credible ingenue of Antigone.

The conflict between Creon’s morality of Politics and
Antigone’s blind devotion a Higher Morality is developed
by Anouilh’s Chorus. Pat Douglas gave the Chorus with
an appropriate disinterested verve, remaining calm in
the face of predetermined conflict and death.

Performances by Louise Hampton as Ismene and
Smith McKeithen as Haemon showed inspired talent in
the supporting roles. The comic relief and irony evoked
by John Morefield as first guard indicated both ability
and good casting.

The intermission was not appropriate to the play.
Neither Anouilh‘s original nor the New York production
indicate the need for it. Much of the tragedy‘s potential
cathartic experience for the Davidson audience was lost
thereby. ‘

Bill Pruitt’s original interlude music gave the tragedy
added depth in total audience impact. His use of wood-
winds, French horns and tympani combined to produce
darkly sombre combinations was commendable for its
effect.

The Vagabonds showed promise of a good season to
come Wednesday. They are now an established organiza-
tion with all the trappings. They are within the system.

They have an audience. Wednesday it came largely
from Charlotte and Queens College. It filled the hall.
It was noisy, not particularly sensitive, but it was an
audience.

The ogre Director John Sneden and the Vagabonds
face now is a danger from within. It is easy to accept
uninspired mediocrity when it is acclaimed by an un-
critical audience.

Anouilh’s Antigone was a challenge accepted grace-
fully. The inadequateness of Galantiere’s translation in
achieving the blunt curtness of the French original made
the challenge even great. But the Vagabonds accepted
the challenge.

The tragedy communicated. By transcending a some-
times platitudinous sounding translation, the tragedy
communicated, even in English.

The Telephone Reviewed
An Insufferable Servant

A confidential news item came to my attention the
other day; mainly that the telephone company has been
installing little black boxes (symbolic possibilities here)
in many of its business establishments. The device will
signal all employees when the atmospheric radiation-
count rises past the danger level. ;

Knowing AT&T's vital interest in public stability
and order, | can imagine the following conversation
taking place.

“Operator, I would like to place a long distance
call to John Doe at Davidson College.”

“Your number ple-e-ese.”

“Xy 45738.”

“One moment ple-e-ese __ there doesn’t
seem to be any answ-ple-e-ese excuse me sir, I must
retire to my fall-out shelter immediately.”

the shaft.” It’s the night before — the phone rings —
you answer.
