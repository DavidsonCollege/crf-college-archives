KR. O. T. C. AND WAR...
Dear Editor:

We are for the R. O. T. C. be-
cause it makes the boys look so
nice. There's nothing like a uniform
to give that snappy look. R. O. T C.
makes the boys stand up straight
and say, “Yes, Sir.” And isn’t that
swell?

We are for the R. O. T. C. be-
cause it teaches boys what war is
like. In the R. O. T. C. they learn
to march in columns, to do right
face, and the manual of arms. They
have dress parades and play-around
with machine guns, and thus learn
about war.

We also favor the R. O. T. C. be-

WHAT HAVE YOU .

Dear Editor:

honors,

With more than mild surprise I
noticed in The Davidsonian of iast
week that Alpha Phi Epsilon, hon-
debating fraternity, had in-
itiated eleven new members. I am
not a disappointed aspirant for I’ve
had nothing to do with debate work
here, but I do wonder how member-
Alpha Phi Epsilon can be
much of an honor when ‘neophytes’
enter in such quantities.

Qualifications for entrance to the
three national debating fraternities
usually include exceptional debating
ability and long experience. The
fellows recently initiated are all fine
men, friends of mine, but prepara-
tion for the fall tryouts seems to
be the extent of the practice and de-
velopment of their ability. “

The lack of opportunity to study
the put
them into practice results in a com-
paratively small number of trained
debaters here. If a total of eighteen
Davidson students have’ received
“honorary” standing worthy of little
gold keys and the name of Alpha
Phi Epsilon, I take it that our chap-
ter is not up to par.

Scott And Trio Give
Novel Musical Stunt

Last Wednesday morning at the
chapel period, the Pan-Hellenic
Council presented an unique an-
nouncement for the benefit of the
student body concerning the presen-
tation of Jan Gf&rber for Mid-
Winters.

As Ken Scott, popular maestro of
the organ, sat at the console, the
rhythm of Jan  Garber's
suave theme song, “My Dear,”
floated out over the audience. Then
soft voices, as if from nowhere, fell

smooth

upon the ears of the already sur-
prised listeners.

An encore Tevealed this myster-
ious trio, as it/was later found out
to be, composed of none other than
J. D. Allen, Pete McKnight, and
Bill MclIlwinen, to be hidden back
the screen among the organ
pipes. Recently it has been ru-
mored that Jan Garber himself ex-
pressed the wish of signing up these
for future publicity.

Were you at one of the many
banquets between the tea and night
dances Saturday evening? If you
were, you will agree with me that
one of the things every banquet
should avoid like the plague that
it is is this lamentable custom of
having speeches, and—much worse
—group singing. Just as you spear
a choice forkfull of somethingor-
other, some alleged speaker rises
and you have to cheese it respect-
fully, with many a wistful look at
your plate, until he ‘has finished.
Now, you think, for the choice
forkful. But no. When the bite
is in mid-air, the toastmaster (may
he step in chewing gum!) waves his
arms, and you either return the fork
to your plate, or risk the embar-
rassmen which usually follows in
the wake of an attempt to sing with
a mouth full of somethingorother.
And to make it worse, you have to
smile through this torment.
