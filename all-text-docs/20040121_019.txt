SATELLITE PARKING LOT—A
conversation immediately preceding
the Wednesday night hookup of

Campbell failed to address any topic
outside of the pair’s former, flawed
love interests. The two, who had never
hooked up with each other before, en-
gaged in the conversation following a
trip to exit 36 to purchase items for a
class project.

“It was one of those talks where you
really feel like you get to
know someone,” com-
mented Stern, a biology
major and resident of
first Cannon. “I really
didn’t know Lisa before,
but man, by the end of
the night I felt like we’d
been dating for years. Or
at least a long weekend.”

The hookup-inducing
conversation began to-
wards the end of the
pair’s car ride to Moore-
sville’s Super Target to
purchase two funny hats
for a Theater 101 skit they performed
last Friday. Stern also took the oppor-
tunity to buy a bottle of hand cream
and a box of Total.

While driving back to Davidson i in
Stern’s 98 Honda Accord, the pair
broached the topic of how relation-
ships are so incredibly screwed up,
inspired by a disapproving comment
of Campbell’s regarding the 90s hit
single “All My Life” by KC and JoJo
that happened to be playing on the
radio.

“The whole trip had basically been
one long, awkward silence, so I was
really just grasping to find something
to say,” recalled Campbell, a second

“Little did I know we would strike up
one of the most meaningful conversa-
tions I’ve had all year. It was really
amazing. I mean, wow.”

Following Campbell’s general de-
nunciation of love and all matters per-
taining to love, she informed Stern of
her break up with her most recent boy-
friend. “I just started talking about Joe
[Colgan ’05] and how we'd ended
things over the break, and suddenly I
was just pouring my
heart out,” she said. “I
told Dave all about the
fights we’d had on the
phone, how Joe thought
things were getting too
serious, about his tramp
ex-girlfriend Sally, our
long, painful battle with
herpes simplex B—all of
it. He was just so under-
standing.”

Coincidently, Stern
was in the process of a
breakup himself, the
facts of which he soon
divulged to an equally sympathetic
Campbell. “Dave just went on and on
about his ex from home, and how the
whole long distance thing just wasn’t
working out,” Campbell continued. “I
totally understood what he was saying.
He was just so compassionate and
thoughtful... and his ex so had no right
to just walk in on him and that Denny’s
waitress like that. I mean, have some
common courtesy.”

By this point in the conversation the
couple had already returned to cam-
pus, where they continued talking in
the dark of their Satellite parking spot

CAMPUS VOICES

DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

Entire freshman class
relocated to Lake Norman Regional

, | REO-Longstanding rumors were con-
¢ firmed on Monday when, in response to
record numbers of alcohol-related hospi-
tal trips among members of the freshman
class, the Residence Life Office an-
nounced that all first-year students would
be moved to new housing in the emer-
gency ward of Lake Norman Regional
Medical Center.
“RLO considered the problem very
carefully and we feel this is the best avail-
,, able solution,” said area coordinator Sa-
rah Jameson. “I don’t have to tell you that

Lake Norman opened its beds to
the freshmen class this weekend.

This entry-level math class is a
great way to meet freshmen girls!

Picture this: I’m sitting in the back row
of a classroom, erudite and worldly fol-
lowing my return from my Junior semes-
ter abroad, and I’m completely sur-
rounded by underclassmen: most of them

- female, in their prime, uncertain, scared,
and searching for a firm and confident
hand to guide them. And just who might
be able to openly extend that guiding
hand? You guessed it. This every-level
math class is a great way to meet fresh-
men girls!

Some guys might recommend getting
girls through frats. Some might tell you to
join an activity, like Concert Choir or
Campus Outreach Weekly. But not me.
My secret to social success? Finite Math

The idea to enroll in an entry-level
math class struck me on the plane ride
back from Florence this December. I
wouldn’t necessarily say I did much
studying during my three months in Italy.

In my entry-
level math class, I’m king of the roost. I
barely even listen to the professor, this
class is so basic. Not that I’m that good at
math. In fact, I haven’t taken a math
course since Junior year of high school,
and that was Beginning Statistics with
Mrs. Flunger, who was deaf and spent
most of the semester in the hospital with
jaundice. But that’s what entry-level col-
lege math classes are for—an easy A. And
an easy way! To meet girls!

Getting back to the girls, they’re hot.
And they’re all really impressed with my
nonchalant attitude to this entry-level
class, clearly noting my seniority and wis-
dom. I can help them navigate the chal-
lenging textbook buying process early in
the semester, suggesting used books in-
stead of the more expensive new ones. I
can help them understand that ‘review’

study of potential test material, as many
first-year females often mistake. And

guessed it. Me!

learned a few of these things last semes-
ter, seeing as how they probably took
classes then and all... but whatever, it
takes more than a semester to get down
all the intricacies of Davidson academic
life. And let’s not forget about the trans-
fers! Oh, the transfers!

Did I mention the group projects? In
entry-level math classes you get to work
on group projects with one to three part-
ners. And you know who makes the best
partners? Freshmen girls! In fact, our
partner selections for our first project on
The Probability of Getting Heads When
Tossing a Coin are due next week. I can
only begin to imagine how many fresh-
men girls are going to put my name down
on their sheet. In fact, I can give you my
answer in a probability: A// of them!

Oh, another thing I forgot to say about
projects is that you get to work on them
outside of class, and that means going to
freshmen girls’ rooms. And that’s so hot,
because freshmen girls don’t wear as

the classroom. Especially in the winter.
Needless to say, I’m just really looking
forward to this class. Now, to all you guys
out there, no going and taking my idea

class, because that will just scare the
freshmen-girls and sketch them out a lot.

sounded like Baghdad on a hot night. We
simply haven’t had enough emergency
lanes to accommodate all of the ambu-
lances and fire-trucks. We've actually had
to redirect traffic through the tennis
courts.”

RLO made a careful study of the prob-
lem and determined that, on average,
87% of first-year students make a trip to
Lake Norman Regional during Court Se-
lection weekend, either for alcohol poi-
soning, broken limbs, or overexposure
caused by running around in a Speedo
like an idiot. Special alcohol-awareness
hall programs, free t-shirts for those who
didn’t get drunk, and extra Davidson 101
sessions were all considered as potential
solutions. Ultimately, it was decided that
the temporary move to Lake Norman was
the best possible answer.

“Our valuable first-year students will
now have instantaneous access to high-
quality medical care,” Jameson said. “It
was the most efficient and practical solu-
tion for everyone involved. And it saves
me one hell of a siren-induced headache.”

Jameson added that in addition to
ambulance pickups, less critical trips to
the hospital were putting a strain on RLO
staff members.

“The amount of time and gas money
hall counselors spent traveling between
campus and Lake Norman Regional was
becoming a big burden,” she said. “Now
that the hall counselors spend Court Se-
lection in the ER, they won't have to drop

everything and drive down to the hospital
at four in the morning when one of their
residents needs a stomach pumped. They
can just walk down the hall.”

Once the decision to move the fresh-
men to a hospital was made, Lake

Norman became the obvious selection.

“Lake Norman Regional has consistently
been Davidson students’ number-one
choice for alcohol-related medical care,”
said Jameson. “They basically know half

year students will now

our kids by name.”

The announcement has drawn mixed
reactions from the first-year students. “I
mean, I like Lake Norman Regional and
all—the nurses are really nice about it
when you barf on their shoes—but will we
have cable TV and internet access?” won-
dered Katie Jackson ’07. RLO officials
quickly assured the students that they
would have the full range of amenities,
including twice the usual number of toi-
lets.
