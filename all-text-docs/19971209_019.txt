In fact, he was utterly disappointed
that the game was not a sell-out, and he
went out of his way to throw a warning
to Davidson or

The men’s basketball team tradi-
tionally plays a few Division III teams
every season. Two years ago, the Wild-
cats faced and beat Catholic, Rhodes,
and Williams. Last winter, it was
Lynchburg, Sewanee, and Connecticut
College.

This year’s non-scholarship fod-
der: Tufts and Carnegie Mellon, whose

Jumbos and Tartans fell to Davidson this
week 89-68 and 91-46, respectively.

These somewhat curious games
with such tiny hoops schools — whose
enrollments, by the way, are almost al-
ways still larger than Davidson’s —
prompt fans of the Division I Wildcats to
ask one straightforward and understand-
able question: Why?

Why play Tufts — an all but guar-
anteed win with seemingly few benefits
— when lower-level Division I teams
such as Winthrop or Radford of the Big
South would offeralmost the same chance
for a win, but against a scholarship oppo-
nent?

“The NCAA looks at how many
teams you beat in the Top 100,” coach
Bob McKillop said yesterday in his of-
fice. “So whether you play a Division III
team or a team ranked below 200 (in the
Division I ratings), it makes no differ-
ence.”

And in terms: of power ratings,
which are. often used at the end of the
season to decide which teams receive at-
large bids, playing Division III oppo-
nents actually helps small conference
teams like Davidson because such games
don’tcount in official Division I rankings.

As far as the power ratings are
concerned, playing the Jumbos or Tar-
tans is far better than facing — and, God
forbid, losing to — a Division I cellar-
dwellar. ,

Plus, for Davidson, the issue of
academic integrity is involved. At least
in part, the men’s basketball staff tries to
put together a schedule that features some

Why Division II? McKillop has answers

tions — or at least some semblance of
admission requirements for athletes.

“I'd love to have atournament where
we play Harvard, Northwestern,
Vanderbilt, or Stanford, or Ivy or Patriot
League teams, schools with academic in-
tegrity that compares to ours,” McKillop
explained. “Unfortunately, we don’t have
that luxury.”

Problem is, most if not all Division I
schools that would agree to come to David-
son would then ask for a return trip.

“For us to fly to Palo Alto to play
Stanford, it doesn’t make sense finan-
cially to have too many of those games on
your schedule,” McKillop said.

Also, many of the nation’s top-notch
basketball schools would host the Wild-
cats in a second, but would not return to
Belk.

“We could go to Maryland, they’d
give us $20,000,” McKillop said, “but
they wouldn’t come back.”

And Davidson, in the interest of ticket
and concessions revenue, has to get its
home games somewhere — and that’s
where the Division III teams come in.
Tufts and Carnegie Mellon relish the op-
portunity to play a Division I squad, but
don’tthen demanda return trip to Medford,
Mass., or Pittsburgh, Pa., respectively.

That allows the Wildcat program to
put its money towards things like travel
expenses for the trip to the Fiesta Bowl
Classic in Tucson, Ariz. later this month.

“There are so many factors,”
McKillop said, “and one is not really more
important than the other.”

Wildcats notch No. 1,000

The Wildcats’ triumph over Carnegie
Mellon Saturday night was the program’s
1,000th victory. A win over VMI last
February was thought to be Davidson’s
1,000th, but the Southern Conference re-
figured its stats this summer and arrived at
aslightly different figure, making the win
over the Tartans the real milestone — or
so say the league’s statisticians ...

In what ultimately amounted to his,

worst effort of the season, Mark Donnelly
was limited by Wake Forest’s defense to
seven points on 3-for-11 shooting.

“He has our respect,” Wake Forest
coach Dave Odom said after his team’s
win. “He nailed us last year (17 points),
and we didn’t want that to happen again.”
... After using the same starting five in the

Ton, Donnelly, Ben Ebong, Landry
Kosmalski, and Stephen Marshall —
McKillop toyed with the lineup this week
in an effort to provide added spark off the
bench. Ton, Davor Halbauer, Donnelly,
Kosmalski, and Marshall got the starting
nod Nov. 29 against Tufts and Wednes-
day against Wake. Against Carnegie
Mellon Saturday, Billy Armstrong re-
placed Halbauer, who sat out due to sick-
Ness ...

Odom on this year’s Wildcats: “I
think this is Davidson’s best team in 15
years. I think this team beats the team
from two years ago handily.”

That squad, led by all-conference
seniors Brandon Williams, Quinn
Harwood, and Chris Alpert, went 25-5
and earned an NIT berth after being upset
by Western Carolina in the league cham-
pionship game ... Alpert is scouting col-
lege games this season for the New York
Knicks ... Williams is playing inthe CBA
for LaCrosse, Wis.

Armstrong money from stripe

After making his first two free throw
attempts of this season Saturday night
against Carnegie Mellon, Armstrong is
working on a streak of 17 consecutive
makes fromthe charity stripe. The senior
co-captain guard made 26 of 29 freebies
last year ... Wednesday’s loss marked
Davidson’s 18th in a row against Wake
Forest. The last Wildcat win over the
Deacons was a 75-72 count at the old
Charlotte Coliseum in the 1978-79 sea-
son. Over the last five years, ACC teams
hold a combined 44-2 record against
Southern Conference foes ... Necmi Ton,
the father of Ali Ton and a professional
basketball coach in Turkey’s first divi-
sion, will be in Davidson for the next two
months. He saw the Wildcats in regular
season action for the first time at the
Wake Forest game ... McKillop was re-
cently chosen as a Congressman for the
National Association of Basketball
Coaches (NABC) ... David Burns, who
scored a career-high 25 points on a pro-
gram record eight three-pointers-in Sat-
urday night’s romp over Carnegie Mellon,
had the rare opportunity of facing off
against .his namesake — the Tartans’
David Burns, a 6-3 freshman forward.
“That was kind of scary,” Davidson’s
Burns said. “I’ve never met someone
with my own name before.”

“There can be only one,” he added.

Once again, postgame praise

Late woes from page 20

ing 47-41 lead.

Another score at this point would
have done wonders in sending David-
son to its first home victory over an
ACC opponent in eight tries.

But a Jerry Braswell three- -pointer
less than 30 seconds later quieted the
raucous crowd of 5,478 and a lay-in by
Deacon rookie star Robert O’Kelley
cut the Wildcats’ advantage to a single

‘ point going into the game’s final five

minutes.
Davidson had missed its chance.
‘ “I thought we played a terrific bas-
ketball game for about 34 or 35 min-
utes,” McKillop explained.
“Then the experience and poise

' factor took its tollonus. When they had

to step up and take big shots, they made
big shots.”

Something the Wildcats weren’t
able to do.

After Halbauer’s shot gave David-
son its game-high six-point lead, the
Wildcats shot 4-for-17 from the floor
the rest of the way — and one of those
four made baskets was a meaningless
Ali Ton layup with one second remain-

ing.

“Maybe if we had made just one
shot down the stretch, stick a bit of a
dagger in them, maybe we could’ve
gone home a winner,” McKillop said..

Once again, an opposing coach of
Big Time University praised the disci-
pline and gutsiness of McKillop’s
scrappy No Name College warriors.

“We feel very fortunate to get out
of here alive,”” Wake coach Dave Odom
said. “I don’t think Davidson will lose
again on their home court this season.

We beat a very good basketball team |

tonight.”

Such kind postgame praise in the
wake of a loss is old hat for the Wild-
cats. Whether by 35 to Duke or five to
Wake, a loss is a loss.

And if Davidson has hopes and
even expectations of making its mark
on college basketball’s national scene
in the next three months — which they
do —.they must start taking advantage
of late-game opportunities and earn wins
rather than respectable losses.

“We’ve-had opportunities to step...
forward and be there in the situations
we’ ve dreamed about and worked for,”
McKillop said. “It’s on the table for us.
Now we've got to do it, we've got to
take it.”

Tufts wasn't tough for long Nov. 29 at
Belk Arena.

Davidson overcame a poor shooting
performance to defeat the Division II Jumbos
89-68.

The Wildcats made only 42 percent of
their field
goals, in-
cluding just
22 percent
from be-
yond the
three-point
line. David-
son converted just three of 18 attempted treys
in the second half.

“We had good looks the whole night,”
coach Bob McKillop said. “That is a good
statement about our offensive performance.
But we couldn't make many shots. The op-
eration was a success, but the patient died.”

What the Wildcats lacked offensively
was more than compensated for on the de-

J|fensive end.

Davidson forced 27 Jumbo turnovers
and held Tufts to just 41 percent shooting. Ali
Ton had what is believed to be a school-
record 11 steals.

David Burns scored 25 points in just 17

over Carnegie Mellon, Davidson's second
and final Division Ill opponent this season. It
was the program's 1000th victory.

raced to a

three-pointers — over the next seven min-
utes to dismantle the Tartans.

“Our goal tonight was to make as many
successive stops as possible on the defen-
sive end,” coach Bob McKillop said. “I think
we did pretty well.”

‘Burns shot 8-of-13 from the field, all
from three-point land.
