Roommate blues: all is not always peachy

By PHILLIP PRESCOTT

Many strange rituals, fetishes and
somewhat unsanitary practices are car-
ried out by almostall the students on the
Davidson campus. These individuals
are not satanic worshippers or voodoo
priests; they are your own dear room-
mates.

The following is a list of 11 funny,
bizarre and somewhat disgusting prac-
tices often indulged in by Davidson
roommates.

1.Particularly annoying to the fastidi-
ous roommate is any extremely weird
or disgusting habit, for hygienic or
other purposes, which your roomate
has. For example, one roommate (he
would not disclose his name) would
gargle his mouth with salt water toclear
his throat. Asa rule, a person should not
make this gargler laugh as the water
and mucus in his mouth will be spit on
to the mirror to harden.

2. You return from a weekend trip. to
find that your bed has been used. Most
irritatingly, by word of mouth, you
discover your bed was used for intimate
purposes.

3. You and your roommate's first
class is at the same time. Central to this
conflict is the fight over the sink, with
the loser in the sink battle almost invari-

complains that your “little” slippers
kept next to your closet (where they are
easily accessible for the bathroom or
shower) are cluttering up the room, is a
bit picky.

5. Beware of the slow awakening
roommate. This person sets his watch
alarm for 6 a.m. (that usually awakens
you, not him), then his alarm clock goes
off at 7:30 a.m. He then proceeds to
press the snooze button several times
and finally awakens at 8 a.m.

6. The roommate that constantly locks
you out of your roomcanalso bea major
problem. You continuously tell your
roommate that you are taking a shower
without yourkey and “Please don’ tlock
the door!” Sure enough, when you re-
turn dripping wet, your roommate has
left and locked the door. Protected only
by a flimsy towel, you walk up several
flights of stairs until you eventually find
an available RA. You tell the RA dis-
creetly that you are locked out of your

4. Beware of the roommate that
speaks of “your space” and “my space”!
While one should respect another’s
privacy, a roommate that unceasingly

room. This could be particularly dis-
turbing if the RA is of the opposite sex.

7. Being kept awake by your “help-
ful” roommate and your roommate’s
friends until 4 or other ghastly hour in
the morning, when you need your rest
for a big exam at 8 a.m.

8. Your roommate, an aspiring
Adonis, wears the same workout
clothes for a whole week because he
figures, “They're going to get sweaty
anyway.” You start to get disturbed
when flies start congregating around
his closet where he keeps his odious
workout clothes.

9. Your roommate, irritated by how
long it takes you to get up and turn off
your alarm, turns it off for you. This
habit of your roommate can be very
annoying, causing you to miss classes
and possibly a major test.

10. Getting locked out of your room
for the night, forced to sleep uncom-
fortably on the couchina friend’s room,
because your roommate must have
“fun” with his girlfriend/her boy-
friend.

11. Coming into the room late
one night you discover that your room-
mate has an unannounced beer party.
Your heart poundsas you watch people
drinking beer precariously close to your
precious computer, fearing with good
reason that your parents will inflict
serious pain on you if the computer is

damaged.

Creative seniors furnish
apartments with style

The senior a artments are

hustle and bustle of campus.

The administration cursed
them.

Seniors desired them.

People sleptin lounges to ob-
tain them. '

No one else can figure out
what NBB 101-B really means.

What really goes on down
there when the rest of us aren’t
looking? Devil worship?
Study? Parties to which even
the freshmen aren‘t.invited?

I wanted the truth, but I got
Tripp Helms, Jay Schmitt‘and
Matt Terrell instead.

Stewart Rawson was myste- ©

riously absent, but his helpful

roommates assured me that if —

he had been there, he would’ve
said that the best thing about
the apartments was their close
proximity to the sophomore
dorms).

These fine fellows are the
proud occupants of what they
describe as the best apartment
on campus. (That’s NBC 301-C
for any freshmen girls wishing
to bake them cookies or serve
as their maid: two services for

which they have a dire need).

The guys say that this loca-
tion gives them the best view of
the golf course. Living in. the
apartments has given them an
opportunity to brush up on
their game, especially that of
the midnight variety, when, as
Terell puts it, “you can tell
where your ballis by the sound
it makes as it falls through the
trees.”

In fact, one of their plans for
improving upon the design of
their dwelling place is to re-
move the side railing on their
balcony, so as to give them a
unique angle on hole #4.

The best thing about living in
the apartments?

“Having your own room,”
they chimed unanimously.

“It's also nice having more

than one roommate,” added
Terrell.

However, Helms, sighing
bitterly, pointed out that
living “with two people who
are stuck at age 12 is a chal-
lenge, especially when one of
them is a New Kids On The
Block fan.”

_ The worst thing about living
in the apartments?

“The beds sqeak and the

walls are thin,” Jay and Tripp
stated gravely.

A quick tour, revealed the
apartment to be spacious, with
a cozy yet classy decor.

Original art works adorn the

walls, and an empty aquarium
awaits the arrival of some cat-
fish: “the only fish we can’t
kill,” says Terrell.

By far, the crowning glory of
the apartment is Fifi, a serving
table shaped like a buxom
French maid, inherited by
Helms from his cousin.

Fifi is rumored to be the
Homecoming date of one of the
inhabitants. (We’ll let you
guess which one).

Other than her date possibili-
ties, Fifi has great significance.

In a way, she symbolizes life
in Terrell, Helms and Schmidt
and Rawson's apartment, and,
perhaps on a higher level, life

intheseniorapartmentsin gen- '

eral.

Why?

Tripp, ina profound burst of
wisdom, provided the answer.

“I find it highly appropriate
that we have in our apartment
something which someone’s
wife wouldn’t let them ec in
the house. id

The mystique is over! Fifi makes the senior apartment of Matt
Terrell, Tripp Helms, Jay Schimdt and Stewart Rawson unique.
