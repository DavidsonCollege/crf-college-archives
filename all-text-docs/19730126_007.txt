Panel Argues Prison

By VAL VAN HORN
Staff Writer

Trying to imagine an ef-
fective corrective system, a
panel of six discussed ‘‘What
Should Happen in Correc-
tions?’ in Hodson Hall Tuesday
as part of the Corrections Sym-
posium.

Frank Hall, area coordinator
of the N.C. Commission of
Corrections, thought it im-
portant to recognize that
corrections are part of a
process.

He feels that people go into
prisons who should not be there.
Hall is a strong believer in
both prevention and probation,

and Operation Regress-Recap,
a gradual process of re-entry in-
to free society after serving
time.

A lawyer from the American
Civil Liberties Union, George
Daly, said that there are four
steps to an effective corrective
system: reformation, the
realization that the inmates’
destiny is in their control, con-
servation of self-respect and the
formation of industrious free
men.

Daly feels that one of the
major problems of the correc-
tion system is that the public
does not care about the welfare
of the inmate. He used the
public opinion about the death
penalty as an example of this
attitude.

Hall's, Cone’s Solutions Differ

By HARRIET HODGES

Speakers Frank Hall and
John Cone suggested differing
solutions to the crime problem
during the Symposium on
Corrections held here January
22-24.

Hall, an official with the N.C.
Corrections Commission,
focused on the progress that
prisons can make _ toward
rehabilitating prisoners. We
want to provide them with an
opportunity to make a gradual
re-entry into society.

In our efforts to prepare in-
mates to re-enter society, we
are trying to do much the same
thing that the defense depart-
ment is attempting to do for
prisoners of war,”’ Hall said.

For the most part, otfenders
are people ‘‘who have the poten-
tial to lead normal, legitimate
lives,’’ Hall said. ‘They are
generally people with little
education, they are from poor
families, and they often have
spotty work records. Most have
known failure.”

Of primary importance in the
corrections process, according
to Hall, is prison officials’
recognition of the reasons
people are in prisons. ‘‘People
in prisons have basic needs just
like people outside. Only they
have found no way to meet
these needs.”’

During the process of
rehabilitation, the kind of
custody an individual receives
should be in keeping with the
degree of custody he needs, Hall
said. ‘‘As a man gets near the
end of his sentence, supervision
should be minimal.”’

Ideally, rehabilitation should
consist of an inmate’s return to
the community on a gradual
basis, according to Hall. Hall
pointed to programs which
allow inmates to return to
school or work in the com-
munity as examples of the type
of rehabilitation he hopes to see.

The community can play an
important part in the
rehabilitation process, ac-
cording to Hall. In helping the

inmate, organizations such as
Community Colleges, Mental
Health clinics, and Family
Planning services provide an
aid which the prison cannot of-
er.

Hall predicted a decline in the
prison population as corrections
officials realize that there is no
need to institutionalize many of-
fenders. As a result, the use of
probation and parole will in-
crease.

This will leave prison officials
with a more challenging
population of prisoners, ac-
cording to Hall. ‘‘However, this
is better than spending time and
money on a man who could do
just as well outside,"’ he said.

Unlike Hall, John Cone of-
fered no hope that prisons could
serve to rehabilitate offenders.

“Corrections officials are out
of the picture when the inmate
gets out of prison. This is not
true with community resour-
ces,”’ Hall said.

Cone, director of Project
Fisherman, a convict

rehabilitation program in
Boston. Mass., said that the
crucial question to ask was,
‘What will reduce the rate of
crime?’’ He added that this was
the purpose of Project Fisher-
man.

In finding a solution to the
crime problem, we should work
before the crime occurs to
detect problems which may
cause the individual to be an of-
fender later, according to Cone.
Cone pointed to recognition of
learning disabilities in school
children as one possible tactic.

Cone insisted that crime
exists because of _ the
‘willingness of society to let it
exist. Only by changing the
structure of the system so that
there is human concern and
sensitivity can we break down
barriers which pit one man
against the other."

The greatest threat to the
future, according to Cone, is
violence. ‘‘And prison is the
most visible institution of
violence in society today ,"’ Cone
said.

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN CORRECTIONS
(L, R) Frank Hall, George Daly, Nathan Witherspoon, Ed Palmer, John Cone and Peter Gerns lead panel discussion on corrections.

Needs And Problems

In order to give his idea of an
effective corrective system,
Nathan Witherspoon, an inmate
at a North Carolina prison, felt
that ‘‘effective’’ needed to be
defined.

Witherspoon feels that if the
public is frightened of the in-
mates, the inmates are equally
frightened of the public.

According to Witherspoon,
the major complaints of the in-
mates depend on the nature of
the crime, as felons and
misdemeanors are treated dif-
ferently.

He says that the complaints
are mostly about living con-
ditions. Witherspoon also spoke
of the sponsor program, where
someone will sponsor an inmate
and escort him to public func-
tions, outings, etc.

John I. Cone, director of
Project Fisherman (non-profit
chartered operation providing
both a ‘‘Release Treatment
Program" and a ‘‘Diversionary
Treatment Program"), says
that we ‘‘have to recognize that
the greatest public crime is the
building and development of the
first prison by the Quakers."

Corrective institutions should
be a graduated system of in-
creased treatment and care,
Cone said. He advised the
audience to ‘get involved in the
community before they are
arrested for repeating crimes
or serious crimes.

‘Every prisoner has a right
to privacy,"’ says Peter Gerns,
an area lawyer. Among the im-
provements that Gerns feels
should be made are more single
cells and the reduction of
solitary confinement.

“Society must address itself
to the inmates’ psychological
needs," he said. ‘Conjugal
visits should be allowed
because this will reduce the
homosexuality rates in prison,"
he said. Gerns also feels that
“work release is very im-

portant."
