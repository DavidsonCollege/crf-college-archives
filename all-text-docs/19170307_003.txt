REVIEW OF LAST ISSUE
OF THE MAGAZINE

The recent issue of The Davidson
College Magazine is by far the best of
this term. The only thing lacking about
the magazine is good, wholesome humor.
The stories, essays and poetry are a
above the average, but the tone of the
magazine is decidedly too serious.

This issue contains four poems, all of
which are good, particularly Cum
ming’s poem on “The Ocean Beach.”
The melody of the words is practicall:
unbroken, and the pictures are clear and
distinct.

Chambliss closes his story, “The
Lunatic,” and gives a striking illustra-
tion of what he believes would happen
to a man who would try to anply mora!
law to everv business. “Owing to
the Weather,” by Love, is a story that is
decidedly worth reading, and shows a
degree of talent very unusual in a Fresh-
man. Altho Howell, in “The Skele-
ton in the Closet.” oversteps the “‘clas-
sical writers” a little. his story is very
interesting and well told.

“Lagore and the Spirits of the Fast
and West.” by J. W. S. Gilchvist, '14
is very interesting and instructive.
Stone, in his contribution about the
early davs of the Phi Society, has added
much to this issue of the magazine. Dr.
Richards. in a convincing article, has
shown clearly “The place of religion in
the curriculum.” to he one of great im-
nortance. “War Poems.” bv S. R.
Keesler, review some of the poetry pro-
duced by the Furopean war, and shows
its powerful effect upon the world lit-
erature. Hamilton, in “Tnisheen” has
written very — entertainingly of the
scenes of his childhood,
