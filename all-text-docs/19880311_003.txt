Bush, Gore victories highlight Super Tuesday;
Panamanian president forced to resign

By KATHERINE PRICE
Headlining the news March 1-9:
Across the Nation: Vice President George
_ Bush won almost all of the Republican
Super Tuesday contests, gaining more than
half of the 1,139 delegates needed to win
the Republican presidential nomination.
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole,
Bush’s chief competitor, fared poorly with
only eight percent, as did the Rev. Pat
Robertson, in third place with less than one
percent. Bush’s victories and Dole’s de-
feats make the upcoming Illinois contest
crucial. If Dole fails to demonstrate his
support there, Bush could have the nomina-
tion locked up.

In Democratic Super Tuesday contests,
Senator Al Gore, who had concentrated his
campaign efforts on the South, gained a
major victory with a total of 340 delegates.
Close behind him were Governor Michael
Dukakis and the Rev. Jesse Jackson with
respective wins of 337 and 322 delegates,
indicating a close battle for the Democratic
nomination. Richard Gephardt had a disas-
trous showing, winning only his home state
of Missouri. Dukakis, Gore, and Jackson
lead in the number of delegates won among
Democratic contenders.
Around the World: Panamanian President
Eric Arturo Delvalle was forced to resign
last week by the National Assembly, which

has close ties to the military. Violence and

instability are rampant in the tiny country, .

as thousands of protesters demand the
removal of General Noriega, head of the
Panama Defense Forces. Noriega has been
charged by the U.S. for drug trafficking.
The U.S. continues to endorse Delvalle,
who attempted to fire the military strong-
man, Noriega.

NATO leaders met in Brussels last week,
addressing Alliance security. Of particular
concern to NATO members is the Soviet
advantage in conventional weapons. Also,

the INF (Intermediate Nuclear Forces) .
treaty was discussed.

Unrest continues in the Middle East as

clashes between Arabs and Israelis mount.
In Israel, Arabs terrorists hijacked a bus,
leading to the shooting of three Israeli
civilians by Israeli police. Israel has wit-
nessed rioting and protest from members of
the Palestinian Liberation Organization in
the occupied territories of the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip during the past few.
months.

Ethnic protests erupted in the Soviet
Union, among Armenians and A zerbaijani-
ans, resulting in the deaths of 31 people.
Tensions among the more than 100 differ-
ent Soviet nationalities present a challenge
to Communist Party leader Gorbachev’s
“glasnost” campaign.

Central American trip stresses region’s politics and religion

Assistant Professor of Political

returned from a trip to Central
America which supplemented
their teachings about the religion

and politics of the region. They.

members on the 14-day excur-
sion, which included study in
Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa
Rica.

The trip was, according to
Kaylor, an “intense experience,
carefully planned,” and meant for

-serious students; While it was not

restricted to those enrolled in the
theology course, the trip was

meant to be a continuation of it,
helping both students and profes-
sors apprehend the material cov-
ered by “experiencing [the situ-
ation] for themselves.” Accord-
ing to Kaylor, the purpose of the
tour of the troubled region was “to
try tounderstand the political situ-
ation in Central America, espe-
cially in relation to the conflict in
Nicaragua and the peace efforts,
the U.S. involvement, and the
relationship between the religion
of the area and the political situ-
ation.”

In order to éxamine both sides:
of the political issues in the three

~ ‘countriés, the group had meetings
‘with both government and reli-

gious leaders, U.S. officials and
heads of labor and business or-
ganizations. They were able to
speak to the editor of a dissident
newspaper,.a representative from
the foreign office of the Nicara-
guan government, and some
members ofa Sandinista youth or-
ganization. They spoke toaleader
of COSEP, an anti-Sandinista
labor group. i

The group was able to travel
into the countryside to meet the
residents of the small villages. It
was hoped that this experience
would allow them to better under-
stand the inhabitants’ reactions

(especially religious) to their suf-
fering. They were, according to
Kaylor, generally exposed to both
sides of the issues.

Senior Caroline Craig’s im-
pressions of the three countries
place Guatemala at the bottom in

-terms of human conditions. She

describes it as having “an aura of

pervasive fear,’ as well as ex-:

treme poverty and poor nutrition.
Nicaragua, on the other hand,
appeared less hard pressed, al-
though it has a terrible economy
and other hardships brought on by
the war. Costa Rica, she claims,
resembled the United States much

‘more than the other places visited.
*’ The villagers of all three coun- ©

tries, interestingly, were “excep-
tionally welcoming,” and seemed
flattered that Americans would
want to see them. Even those who

were suffering the most “seemed °

to hold on to hope; above all,
they’re alive,” she adds.

While the students were unable
to meet with Nicaraguan contras,
they did speak to some business-
men whose vested interest in pri-
vate property led them to support
the rebels in order to avoid the loss
of their capital to communists.
Students also met with a sympa-
thetic group of Guatemalans.

Kaylor believes that very few

Nicaraguans want the contras to
~win, because few actually believe
that a contra-established govern-
ment would be democratic. They
feel, he says, that a contra victory
would put them “right back in the
same position.”

-In addition, he says, most of the
Nicaraguans with whom they
spoke believe that the contras
cannot survive without U.S. aid.

According to senior Sarah
Payne, the hardest thing to deal
with for the concerned student is
the apparent despair of the situ-

‘ ation. No one seems to have any

plan that would help ease the suf-
fering of the people, who, she
explains, only want “the right to
choose for themselves which
course their country will take.”

“It’s especially hard to deal
with the fact that our government
is So involved in it,” she adds. She
describes the trip as a “very eye-
opening experience” which has
caused her to ask, Oe can I do
to help?”

Craig summed up. “On some
levels, the situation seems clear, if
not easy but on other levels, it’s
intricately complex. It is much
less an issue of right and wrong
than of every aspect of being
human; itcan’t be apolitical issue,
but a human one.”
