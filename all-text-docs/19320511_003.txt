TODAY

The subject of our Tales this week, dear read-
star,

ers, is none other than Davidson's dash

Fred Fleagle. Perhaps you've wondered why

his name hasn't crashed into this column be-
fore. Well, all we have to say is that it’s not
~if
dog bites a man, but if it happens the other

news—as you've no doubt heard before a
way around, it is news. So has it been with
Fleagle. Davidson's bit of “greased lightning”
had been coming in first in both the 100 and
220-yard dashes in most of Davidson's track
meets, and consequently it failed to be news
when Fleagle won. But at the State meet held
at Chapel Hill Saturday, Fred was nosed out
by Carolina’s Farmer, who has been traveling
over those very same cinders for several years,

in both the 100 and 220-yard events.

“Monk” Younger and “Tex” Tilson, who
coached Davidson’s athletic teams for the
past ten years, are back in town after five
weeks of spring football coaching spent at
V. P. I., where the two are to assume reg-
ular duties next fall. The two former Wild-
cat mentors will remain in Davidson with
their respective families until the latter part
of June when “Monk” will go to Camp Caro-
lina and “Tex” to Camp Mitchell as direc-
tors.

Coach “Doc” Unger is pleased with the spirit
shown by the members of this year’s Freshman
wrestling squad who have been reporting for
the night workouts he is conducting. However,
the wrestling coach expressed regrets that mem-
not shown

enough interest to report regularly. Unger con-

bers of this year’s varsity have

siders his chances of putting a winning team
on the mat next year great only if he can get
full co-operation from members of both this
season's squads.

All of Davidson’s athletic teams, with the
exception of the tennis representatives, will
bring their campaigns to a close for the
year this week. The varsity baseball team
is in Durham today, engaging the Blue Devils
for a return game. Tomorrow the curtain
will be dropped when the Wildcats play
Wake Forest there.

The Freshman baseball team, after meet-
ing Belmont Abbey here this afternoon, will
entertain Wake Forest Freshmen at Rich-
ardson Field Friday in its last game of the

season. nm

undefeated Freshman tennis
team will journey to Hickory to meet the
high school netmen of that city Thursday
in its final match. The varsity netmen meet
Duke University here today, but will not
close its season until next week when Fur-
man University visits Davidson for a return
engagement.

Wildkitten Leaders
Show Batting Slump

Although they slumped greatly during the last
three games, batting leaders of the Freshman
nine still had enough points left to retain their

week, but continued to lead the Wildkitten hit-
ters with an average of .481. Morris, regular
first baseman, dropped from .467 to .372 but
failed to lose possession of second place.

Johnny Mackorell, shortstop, showed the
greatest increase by getting six hits, three of
which were good for extra bases, in twelve
300 to .357, and fix himself in third place.
Mackorell also scored three times to take the
lead in this department from Bumgardner, who
failed to tally.

By hitting a homer, triple and double during
the week,-Mackorell pulled away from Morris,
who connected for a home run for his only extra
hase blow, for highest number of extra bases.

Wildkittens Lose Games
To Three Big Five Foes

Davidson's Freshman baseball team suffered
defeats at the hands of three Big Five yearling
nines on an invasion into the eastern part of the
state last week.

Carolina Freshmen crushed the Wildkittens,
12 to 4, in the first game of the trip. Frrors and
inability to hit the offerings of Lewis and Chil
dress brought Davidson's downfall. After per-
mitting the visitors three runs in the second in-
ning, the Tar Bahies came back in the third to
score nine times and clinch victory.

Zaiser of Carolina led the hitting with two
homers, a triple and a single in four times at
bat, while Morgan and Mackorell of the Wild
kittens followed close behind.

Five Old Records Fall
As North Carolina Wins
State Track Supremacy

Fleagle Stars for Davidson, Pushing
Farmer, Carolina Ace, in Both
Sprint Events

Five new North Carolina collegiate track rec-
ords were set last Saturday as an extraordinary
group of athletes from this state gathered at
Chapel Hill for their last meet of the season.
North Carolina easily took the meet with 81
points to win the state championship for the
twelfth consecutive time. Duke gave them the
competition, coming second with 49
points, and Davidson came next with 25 points.
North Carolina State had a score of 9, and Guil-
ford trailed with 2.

Brownlee of Duke proved to be the sensation
of the meet when he clipped off the low hurdles
in the remarkable time of 23.3 seconds. Leading
the field by about 15 yards, he bettered the old
state mark set by him last year. According to
many officials of the meét, it is the best time
recorded anywhere in the country this year.
North Carolina flash, stepped the
220-yard dash in the exceptional time of 21 sec-
onds flat. He also won the hundred-yard dash
in the good time of 9.8 seconds. In both events

Farmer,

FMleagle, of Davidson, showed up well, coming
in only a yard behnid Farmer each time, and
heating Brownlee, who is also noted as a sprint-
er, in the century.

Farmer led the varsity scoring for individual
points by winning the 100 and 220-yard dashes
for a total of 10, Mullis of Carolina came next
with 8 points, and Brownlee of Duke, and Hig-
by of Carolina each had 7.

The 440-yard dash was a tense race in which
Marland of Carolina edged out Fulmer of Duke,
to set a new mark of 49.4 seconds, beating the
old record by a full second. New records were
