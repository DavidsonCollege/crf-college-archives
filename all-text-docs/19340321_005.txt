A concert will be given by the Da-
vidson concert band. The details of
this musical program have not yet

been completed, but it is expected that |’

tration members will speak to several
of the local chapters. Plans are not

that the local chapters will listen to
the radio program.

first alumni magazine, will make its
appearance about the first of April, and
will announce details of the Founders’

tion will be news of the college of

OPINION OF PROGRAM

(Continued from page 1)
their products, to engage more work-
ers, and to pay higher: wages.

“The whole scheme of restoration
and recovery adopted by the Roose-
velt administration looks toward more
government supervision of private
business than we have ever had before
in this country, but as the President
himself explains, the government has
no desire to dictate, but to establish
a co-operative partnership with busi-
ness, so that all economic groups may
work together and thus maintain a
well-co-ordinated economic organiza-
tion.

“Rugged individualism may be dis-
appearing, but mutual co-operation
and helpfulness will be substituted in
its place. I believe that most modern
and thoughtful men will agree that
this is a better plan than the old plan
of bitter competition to the destruction
of any rival business.”
