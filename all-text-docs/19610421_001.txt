Fine Films Festival
Is Union Success

David Simpson, Union Film
chairman, reported this week
that attendance for the Fine
Films Festival has been “sur-
prisingly good,” although he
doesn’t believe the audiences
are not coming entirely for the
artistic qualities of the festival
program.

“Whether Davidson students
recognize it or not, these mov-
ies represent some of the “best
treatments of human nature yet
attempted,” he commented.

The first night 450 people,
“the largest crowd anyone can
remember ever having come to
the Morrison Room,” crowded
into the ballroom, more than
paying for all the festival's costs.
The average attendance since
then has been about 300 per
night.

Simpson hopes to run one
foreign movie a month next
year if there is enough interest
in these films for their real
importance. He is also consider-
ing an experimental closed fes-

Looking ahead to next year,
Dr. Goodykoontz hoped that rig-

would not cut drama’ off from

This, he said, was what killed

Most of all, he expressed the
desire to see the spirit of non-

2 Missionaries Speculate
On Congolese Adjustment

By DON SAUNDERS

’ Davidsonien Associate Editor

Two former missionaries to the Congo visited campus this week. They told the
Davidson student body that the language and culture barriers which will isolate any
Congelese student here will be the most difficult problems to surmount.

Mrs. David Miller, recently re-
turned from the Congo while
her husband stays on the field,
spoke in assembly on Monday.
She sketched living conditions
in the Congo under the Belgians,
noting that “the educated are
a minority in the Congo.

STOPPED SHORT

“The Congolese student is on
the line,” she said, “between the
primitive conditions in the bush
and the privileges of the educat-
ed. The Belgians stopped a lit-
tle too soon in bringing culture
to the Congo. They imparted a
materialistic society but quit be-
fore the people were ready for
independence.”

Mrs. Miller pointed out the
tribal customs which surround
the relationships between the
sexes. “If the Congolese come
to Davidson, it will be up to you,
the students, to teach them the
relationship you have in dating
and friendships,” she said.

After assembly, at a coffee
hour in the Morrison Room of
the College Union, Mrs. Miller
gave a fuller account of the
missionary activity in Congo.

Davidson College was one of
the ten colleges located through-

a $5,000 grant from the Union
Carbide Educational Fund. This
amount is for the support of our

The grant was presented to
President D. Grier Martin at a
luncheon attended by C. J.
Metz, secretary and trustee of
the Union Carbide Educational
Fund and the three Union Car-
bide Educational Fund and the
three Union Carpide Scholars
now at Davidson.

In making the presentation,

of students and to members’ of

seemed confident that many of
the problems being foreseen for
the incoming Congolese will
“work themselves out.”

He teld the group that “just
being on the Davidson campus”
would be a tremendous exper-
ience for the students, and hop-
ed that any off-campus trips
could be planned in advance to
prevent incident.

Both speakers were arranged
for by the Congolese Committee,
a joint faculty-student-towns-
people group which is investi-
gating the various difficulties
which may arise when and if
Congolese students arrive on
campus.
