The Advisory Council on
Campus and Religious Life
voted to uphold the principal
of self-selection for all the
houses on Patterson Court at
their Monday meeting.

This vote came as the result
of a proposal made by the
Subcommittee on Patterson
Court which has been discus-
sing possible revisions in the
present self-selection system.

‘‘The subcommittee was
formed for the purpose of
investigating Patterson Court
and to recommend to the
Advisory Council regulations
for the operation of all aspects
of the Court,’’ explained Pro-
fessor of Chemistry Felix A.
Carroll, chairman of the sub-
committee.

There has been much dis-
cussion lately because of re-
puted problems with the pres-
ent system. The subcommittee
has held hearings on the
subject and has received pro-
posals for reform from several
people.

These proposals have
ranged from one calling for
computer match-up of fresh-
men with houses to a dual-
type system in which fresh-
men_would. decide in advance
whether they wanted to be
considered by the fraternities
or the eating houses.

‘The subcommittee did
carefully consider both the
proposals for a bid system or
dual system and it also con-
sidered the opinions expressed
in the open meeting,’’ said
Carroll. |

“But in the end we felt we
could not recommend to the
Advisory Council any system
which involved a bid or a dual
system.

‘‘We also looked at the
systems proposed to us from a
wide variety of angles, not

gt concentrating none nar. __.*[mplicit in the nraposal are .

professor who accepted an
invitation to join the faculty at
Davidson, but warned that he
considered ‘‘morally repug-
nant, socially anachronistic,
and scholastically unwise’’ the
college’s policy (contained in
the Trustee By-Laws) of re-
quiring all tenured professors

o ‘‘uphold and seek to in-
crease the college’s effective-
ness as a Presbyterian church-
related college.”

The Trustees declared in
their May meeting that it had
become “‘increasingly clear
that it will be impossible for
the administration of the col-

lege to apply to the provisions
of this by-law without the im-
plication of discrimination.”

The Trustees adopted a
resolution initiating the by-
law revision process, and in-
structed their Executive Com-
mittee to refine the resolution
for the Board’s October meet-
ing.

Over the summer the Exec-
utive Committee made minor
changes in the wording of the
resolution, and recently sent
their final draft to the campus
for information and comment.

Vote uphc olds self-selection:
Council postpones decision

The proposal made Monday
contains two major changes
from the system in practice
now.

At self-selection no person
may choose to join a house at
which he has not eaten or
participated in some form of
organized social event.

‘‘One of the very strong
objections that was heard at
the open meeting involved
people who signed up at a
house who had never ex-
pressed any interest in the
house before self-selection,”’
explained Dean of Students
Will Terry.

It is hoped that this provi-
sion will eliminate to some
extent this problem.

Another change in the pro-
cedure concerns pledging the
national fraternities. All fresh-
men who are eligible for frat-
ernity membership that select
one of the four national houses
on campus may, at the house’s
discretion, be required to
pledge that fraternity.

The Advisory Council did
not feel that there had been
adequate time to examine the
proposal carefully so they
reaffirmed their commitment
to self-selection and sent the
proposal back to the subcom-
mittee for review and revision.

, It is not known’ whether or
not the proposal will be comp-
leted in time to implement it
fully this year.

Subcommittee member Bob
Morrison urged everyone to
examine the proposal as a
whole and not to criticize the
small details: :

“It’s easy to criticize. We
have a lot of critics on this
campus but not enough con-
structive thinkers. I would
like to see criticism in a more
positive sense,’’ he said.

Fellow subcommittee mem-
ber Vance Christopher echoed
those sentiments.

changes that will help both

fraternities and eating houses.
The general direction of the
proposal will help solve some
of the problems.

“But there is not one speci-
fic thing in the proposal that

will solve all the problems,” he -

said.

This action produced vari-
ety of responses around the
court.

Emanon President Gil
Cuthbertson’s response is typ-
ical of the sentiments ex-

pressed by the presidents of

[See PRESIDENTS, page 3}

many in the faculty are un-
comfortable with the wording
of this resolution. With two
others, he co-authored the
faculty recommendation to a-
mend the by-law.

“The Trustees’ resolution
requires that persons (in the
faculty and administration)
who are non-Christians must
be ‘persons of genuine spiri-
tuality’. There is no effort to
explain what that means, how
it would apply, or what a
person would have to do to live
up to it,”” Maydole commen-
ted.

‘‘There is, moreover, the

but that they alew must ‘work
with respect for the Christian
tradition’.

“Again we have ne of (howe
words which 1s vag'ue— name.
ly, ‘respect’. How, for exam-
ple, would a devout Jew live
with respect ‘or the Christian
tradition?,” esked Maydwole.

“Would he have to resnect
all of the Christian tradition,
some of the Christian tradi-
tion, these tenets, or those
tenets—which elements must
he have respect for?

“In my opinion, those are
the two main trouble spots in
the Trustees’ resolution,”
Maydole said.

SGA alters election date;
turnover set for springtime

By GEORGE MURDAUGH
Staff Writer

Beginning this school year,:
the student body will elect the
SGA president, vice-presi-
dent and upperclass senators
in an election on the second
Tuesday of spring term.

In past years the SGA
president and vice-president
were elected early. in winter
term. Upperclass senators
were elected in a separate
election later in the term,
giving losers in the first
election a chance to run for
class senator positions.

The new election process
was adopted by the Senate
last year under the leadership
of SGA ex-president Bo Bas-
kin.

Current SGA President
Thom Young feels that the
move to consolidate these two
elections in the spring term
will, make the Senate more
efficient.

_ “Now the SGA officers will
begin working right away with
the class sezatcrs-elected i=
the same election. All these

people will serve together aur-
ing the same period of time.

“With the same class sena-
tors working on projects
throughout an administration,
we can follow through better
with things like course evalu-
ations."

A spring election will also
allow maximum efficiency of
the Senate during winter term,
when many important deci-
sions are made. |

Young said that spring term
will be a learning time for
future SGA presidents when
‘busy work’’ can be accom-
plished.

“In the spring, the Senate
appoints 30 to 40 students to
various boards, and this pro-
cess takes a lot of screening
time. The main business at
five of our nine meetings last
spring was to screen people for
boards.”

He also pointed out that the
most productive time for the
president — his last two school
terms in office— will not be

used as a planning period to
outline SGA activities for the
upcoming fall and winter
terms.

Joanne Hull, chairman of
the Elections Council, said

that the election reform wil!

cut down on the amount of
work the Council hes nad to do
in the past .

“When campus elections
were spread out ali through
the year it wes coniusing. This
(election reform) will cut down
on th: nuraber of elections we
have (o prepare for.”

In the past campus elections
were held twice during both
the fa} and winter terms, and
once «luring the spring. Now
there will se one election every
term.

Currently there are no plans
to charge the term of election
for any cf the other offices
traditionally elected in the
winter term.
