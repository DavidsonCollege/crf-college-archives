Clemson Wins Opening
Series With Davidson

Inexperienced Home Nine Lose
12-4 and 21-0 In First
Games
Davidson's 1943 baseballers open-
ed the season here last Wednesday
and Thursday against a smooth and
powerful Clemson nine, which
pounded out victories over the in-
experienced Cats in both games,

12-4, and 21-0.
First Score

For the first four frames of Wed-
nesday’s game, Davidson seemed
headed for victory, having punched
across one run in the opening stanza
with Tomy Peters scoring on “Ace”
Maloney’s double, and getting two
more inthe third on- an error, a
single by Jack Loughridge, and a
double by Peters.

Meanwhile Clemson could do
nothing with the offerings of Paul
Neisler, but in the fifth inning the
Tigers bunched a free pass and
three singles to push across three
markers and knot the count at 3-3.
Jim Lowry replaced the tiring Neis-
ler at the beginning of the sixth, but
Was quickly sent to the showers by
a walk, a single, and two doubles,
which netted the visitors five runs.

O’Hair Relieves

Dick O'Hair relieved Lowry in an
attempt to quell the rampant Tigers
and retired the side, but the slug-
ging Bengals came back in the
seventh and eight frames to pound
out two singles, a triple, and a four-
base blow, which brought four more
tallies. Davidson had been unable to
touch the Clemson ace, Herb Her-
ren, further, and their only other
run came in the ninth inning on
Maloney's homer with none on.

Lanky Jim Lowry started on the
mound for the Cats in Thursday’s
encounter but was shelled from the
hill in the first frame by four Clem-
son bingles and three Davidson er-
rors, Which brought in five Tiger
runs. Tommy Peters was called’in
from centerfield to the mound and
retired the side after being pounded
for a double, a triple, and three more
tans.

Peters could do little with the
Tigers, the visitors blasting out nine
more hits and seven runs before
Neisler relieved him in the seventh
The Bengals —dikewise — pounded
Neisler, collecting five hits and
seven runs in the last three in-
nings. z

rected by Bill Lyman and Jim Chap-
man, was ‘entitled, “Look What
Liquor Done.” Its cast was made up
of Bill Lyman as the aged mother
of a worthless husband who drank
his family to ruin, played by Jim
Chapman, with Harvey Carrow as
the grandmother, Myron Sandifer
as the daughter, Dick Port as the
Villian, and Deane Watson as the
hero. It had as its moral the
theme that drink never pays.
