TREBLE CLEF CLUB
HERE THURSDAY NIGHT

The Lyceum attraction that was given
last Thursday night by the ‘Treble Clef
Club was one of the best that has been
seen here.

A very attractive and humorous part
of the program was a dramatic mono-
logue. One of the ladies represented a
number of characters and not a few
times caused the hall to roar with ap-
plause and laughter. She has a remark-
able talent for representing ‘different
characters both in appearance and voice.

Although the monologue was very
much enjoyed, music was the main part
of the program. The minds of the au-
dience were carried back to slavery times
when, dressed in ginghams and with
banjo in hand, the ladies appeared and
began singing, accompanied by the banjo,
the old plantation melodies. The mim-
icry was perfect and one had only to
close his eyes to imagine he were listen-
ing to the darkies of the ‘60's.

Popular songs were also sung. To-
ward the last of the program two ladies,
dressed in Colonial style, appeared on
the stage and sang old songs and danced
the minuette. Among others they sang
the sweet old songs, “Just a Song at
Twilight,” and “The Sweetest Story
Ever Told.” The quartet closed the
program by singing “Songs My Mother
Used to Sing,” and others.

The program was well rendered
throughout and thoroughly enjoyed.

PLANS FOR SOPH BANQUET.

Forty of the Sophs have already
signed up for the annual Soph Ban-
quet and it is expected that many more
will go. as a thorough canvass has not
yet been made of all the dormitories.
The banquet is to be held at the Central
Hotel, Charlotte, which has recently
been remodeled, and is now under new
management. February 21 has been
chosen as the most suitable date. As
usual, a special train will return to Dav-
idson after the banquet, but the regular
trains will be used on the down trip.

BUSINESS FIRM MOVES.

The recent heavy rains have seriously
undermined the foundations of the Ar-
mour Bros. & Thompson building, neces-
sitating the removal of that firm to the
old Cranford store building. The floor
of the Armour building has sagged dan-
gerously: in some places pulling the
shelving completely from the walls. The
building will be remodeled, and then re-
occupied by the same firm. The Tetton
Drug Co. building, next door, is un-
damaged.

Furman University—Tue Davio-
SONIAN welcomes to its exchanges The
