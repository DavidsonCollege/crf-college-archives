LITERARY NEWS

VISIT TO LIBRARY REVEALS |
SOME EXCELLENT seats

Upon looking over the books that have |
recently been catalogued in the library, a
person cannot help noticing the variety
of subjects that they cover.

There is a copy of “Educational Psy-
chology,” by ‘Starch; one of “Military
Man-Power,” by Lincoln Andreiss. Mr.
Licks has written a book called “Recre-
ations in Mathematics,” and a copy of
that has been added. Although we have
isgivings as to the absolute truthful-
ness of the title of this last named one,|
we hope that others than
Douglass and Currie will be found who}
will be able to vouch for it. A copy of
“Handbook of Birds,” and also a beauti-
fully illustrated two volume edition of
Seton's “Life Histories of Northern Ani-
mals,” have been added to the books on
“The Life of Com-
modore Matthew C. Perry,” by Wim. El-
liot Griffis, which is another recent ad-
dition, becomes particularly iteresting at
this time when the world is beginning to
realize the importance of Japan. All will
recall that it was Commodore Perry who,
about 1825, when commander of the
North Carolina, the largest battleship of
her time, knocked at and opened the fast |
closed door of Japan, and invited her to
join the famity of nations.

POLITY CLUB STAGES SMALL
DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE

birds and animals.

A very interesting and instructive mect-
ing of the Polity Club was held in Shear-
er Hall last week. The plans of the meet-
ing were to represent a miniature arma-
ment conference, on which five very in-
structive papers were read.

Lacy, presiding over the meeting, open-
ed with the reading of his paper. Rep-
resenting America, he set forth the ob-
ject of the armament conference, inelud-
ing Mr. Hughes’ plan of the conference.

Each in turn represented his country, *

first giving a brief sketch of its history, |
its alliances, and the benefits and effects
which the armament conference would
have it. The members taking part |
were: W. W. Moore, representing Ja-
pan; H. Ky Russell, England; L. A. Tay-
lor, China; and A, C. Summers, France.
At the close of the meeting those pres- |
ent expressed the opinion that they had,
a much clearer conception of what is |
now being done by all the nations rep-
resented at the conference.

PROFESSOR HARDING WRITES
OUR COLLEGE SONG IN GREEK

on

Dr. C. R. Harding, professor of Greek,
has composed the chorus of the college
song, O Davidson, in Greek. All men in|
his have been practicing this |
chorus for several weeks. If someone
would give the Chinese now, Davidson’s
beautiful and stirring college song would |
have gone around the world. |

On the night of January 18th the Se-

elect a student ‘councilman to fill the
vacancy caused by J. P. Price’s resigna-
tion. The following. named men were
nominated: LaFar, Sprunt, McKeithen,
Knox, and McCrary. Upon his own re-
quest LaFar’s name was withdrawn.
There was only one ballot taken, Sprunt
being elected with Knox as second man.

DAVIDSON MEN SUPPORT THE
WILSON FOUNDATION DRIVE

The Davidson students responded al-
most unanimously in the recent Wood-
row Wilson Fund drive and a total of
cne hundred and twenty-five dollars was
raised, Prof. A. Currie made a short
talk at chapel on the aim of the drive
and said that it was founded with the
purpose of propagating the ideals of
Wilson by giving prizes, similar to the
Nobel prizes, for distinguished work in
the realms of international peace and
unity.

The town of Davidson was divided up
into sections and a goodly amount. was
raised there also. Davidson is proud of

POINT SYSTEM INAUGURATED
FOR GRADUATION REQUISITE

The faculty, during the past few years,
has noticed that the average scholastic
standing has becn somewhat below nor-
mal. As a result the point system has
been introduced as an incentive to bet-
work, This system been used

ter has

jand found successful in several colleges

and universities of note.
In ths system the points are arranged

jin a scale in accordance with the prets-

ent method of grading, A grade of A,
for one term, is equal to four points;
> of B is equal to three points; C
is equal to two, and D to one, If the
grade is continued for the whole year
the pdints are doubled.

Under this system it is necessary for
a student to obtain two hundred points

in four years, or an average of fifty

DAVIDSON PROFESSORS OF |

THE FUTURE ARRIVE HERE

Signals, 19, 26, 42, 8! These were the)

jlirst sounds which were audible from|

young Hugh Morton Grey, junior. By|
this we know that he, like his worthy|
father, will don the moleskins, and his
name also will be written in the David- |
son Hall of Fame. This may seem like |
a rather early prophecy, becauSe Hugh |
Junior was only born January 10th, but
from all indications he is following in his |
father’s footsteps, and who knows but
that some day he too might control the
Red and Black Warriors. Here’s to you,
young Hugh Morton, junior!

“Now gentlemen, John Milton is one of
our greatest English poets.” Yes, when
we send our sons to Davidson in the
future they will have the same advant-,
ages which we now enjoy, for then as
now, an_ illustrous Doctor Shewmake
will head the English department. That
will be our guess, if the old proverb of
“life father, like son,” holds true, for the
son has arrived and will without doubt
be brought up in the way which has
gained fame for the present Doctor
Shewmake. On New Year's day, the
third young “Cobbler” arrived in David-
son, and has been named Charles Tiffin
by his parents, Dr. and Mrs. Edwin F.
Shewmake.

casions next week. Trinity at Durham,

{menu to be dished up on the nights of
February 7th to roth inclusive.

The Red and Black quint has won
handily both games on its home floor,
and starts on its tour of the Tarheel
State confident that it can come out on
top in all four squabbles. The local
“poison squad” meets the strongest
teams in the state in this series, which
is expected to supply the acid test to the
Wildcats’ metal.

of the squad and this is the reai secret
of the team’s success so far; whether on

Romefelt, who so ably led the initiations

last year.

Mid-day chapel exercises proved a joy
to the upper-classmen and a nightmare
to the Freshies. Many were fhe appli-
cations after the exercises were over to
assist in gathering up the hymn books,
sweeping the floor, etc’, etc. Wise they
were, for outside the four walls of that
historic building upper-classmen awaited
them galore. A battle royal ensued as
each Freshie put in an appearance. The
conflict was equal to Napoleon at Water-
loo, for the poor Fresh went down in

Boo LaFar is now the supreme com-
mander of the Ancient Order of Mystic
Whiteness, he having been given his
