IMAC Flickerballers Conclude

Initial Half Of 1973 Season

By CAPTAIN AMERICA
And
NO BUCKY

The first half of the season
has ended in flickerball and the
leagues have been divided into
four new sections of six teams
apiece, according to previous
won-lost records.

Wrapping up last weeks ac-
tion, (as there were only 11
games due to all sorts of junk),
on Thursday the Cleveland In-
dians ‘“‘flew” past an earth-
bounded PGD team, 32-24.
Team spokesman Mark

Rodgeman was heard to have
mumbled something about ‘‘sit-

ting downtown in a railway
station’’?

When asked to repeat his
Statement for posterity Rodge
replied, ‘I don't know what |
said, “I guess I forget it
already.”

Stop the press! People. lift
your trumpets in rejoiceful
halleluhahs! The ATO’s have
won not one, but TWO flicker-
ball games. The Zeroes found
the light when they won their
first game over lowly C-III
(gobble ) 33-20.

C-III and C-IV continue to
show astonishing ineptitude. |

Sailors Finish Third,

Conquer Fierce Winds

By TRACY CHARLES
Staff Writer

Thirty knot winds and two
and one-half foot swells blasted
the College of Charleston's An-
nual Fall Regatta to a start last
weekend.

Planning conditions off the
battery prevailed for most of

the day, abating somewhat
towards late afternoon.
Because of the high winds early

in the day, five boats broke
down causing the regatta to be
postponed for quick repairs.

The Davidson team's ex-
perience the week before in
Charleston waters at The
Citadel, did much to promote
their success at College.

Daryl Douglas and his crew
Mike Mayer placed third out of
seven in A division. Douglas’
extensive knowledge and use of
tactics substituted for ex-
perience inn the tidal waters.

Frank Somerville, with crew
Tracy Charles, exhibited a
proficiency not seen at the
Citadel. Somerville placed
second (out of seven) in the B
division. Somerville’s ability to
use the tides to his benefit and
his skill in surfing the boat gave
him the advantage necessary to
stay on top

Davidson placed third out of
the seven schools represented,
only one point out of second

There will be two SAISA
regattas next weekends In

singlehand competition.
Georgia Tech will host their an-
nual Fall Regatta.

Old Dominion University will
also host a regatta this
weekend. The skippers ten-
tatively scheduled to attend
these two regattas are Dave
Francisand Chris Manglesdorf.
