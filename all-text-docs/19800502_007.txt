Rusk Scholars like friéndliness, c

Culture shock. That’s what
you’d expect the Rusk Scholars
to say they experien upon
coming to Davidson from Lon-
don, England. But as Chris
Darvill, one of this year's
“Ruskies,” remarked, ‘‘The cul-
ture shock was that there
wasn’t a culture.” |

Darvill elaborated by saying
that there was not a graspable
sense of history here, as com-
pared to that in England.
There, he said, ‘“‘you have St.
Paul’s, Westminister, all a-
round you—it’s unavoidable. In
New York all we saw were
skyscrapers.”

The Rusk Scholars ‘program,
named after Dean Rusk, brings
six students from the St.
Paul’s School in London to
Davidson each spring term.
While here, they take one
course and audit one, thus
giving them time to get to know
the country and the people.

All seven of the Ruskies

agreed that the people, particu- .

larly in the South and here at

Davidson, were a pleasant sur-’

prise. Jackie Davis was amazed
at the “‘openness when you meet

people here. I can meet some- .

one, sit down, have a drink, and
in ten minutes be talking about
things it would take English
people ten years to get around
to.”

And both Darvill and Charles

iy
if

Mathias were surprised by the
approachability of the profes-
sors; in England, apparently,
there is more of a ‘‘god-to-
worm’’ feeling in the classroom
rather than the relative equality
we enjoy in relationships with
professors. ‘‘Teachers are much
kinder here,” Darvill said.
The biggest difference the
English students noticed be-
tween the American and British

cultures was the educational
system—both the way it works
and the students’ attitudes to-
wards it. The British system is
most demanding between the
ages of fifteen and eighteen,
when the students thoose three
subjects in which to do concen-
trated study. Mathias said that
during this time there is ‘‘a
great deal of pressure.” Then,
when it is time to go to college
and specialize in just one sub-
ject, it is almost possible to ‘‘sit
down and go to sleep for a
year.” -

Exams are administered only
about once every two years, and

students are allowed much more

freedom to do independent work
in their area of specialty. The
disadvantage of this system,
according to the students, is
that they are forced to specialize
early in their education, and
thus changing a major, though
not impossible, is fairly diffi-
cult.

The other major difference
the students noted was the
attitude expressed toward lear-

riticize conformity in

f

ning—on both the professors’
part and the students’. Jo
Stutter was surprised that in
courses here, there are fre-
quently only one or two text-
books assigned. In the English
system, there would be more
eclecticism, with the students
using different books in the
library to look up the material
themselves, rather than pas-
sively receiving the information

. from one source.

And the students here, Tere-
sa Clay noted, ‘have not much
intellectual curiosity.” Stutter
added that there was ‘‘no sense
of an intellectual elite,’’ and
Catherine Allen laughed that
“there aren't even any intellect-
tual ‘pseuds!’ ” Darvill noted
that we are “taught to learn,
rather than find out,” that we
‘learn facts. rather than the
reasons behind the facts.”

The Rusk scholars pointed

out a few other. minor differ-.

ences. Stutter found it “‘incred-
ible that juniors and seniors are
in the same classes with fresh-
men and sophomores,’’ and

May 2, 1980—The Davidsonian—7

Davidson

Mathias was surprised at the
early eight o'clock class hour.
“We're very civilized in Eng-
land,” he said. “We start at
nine.”

Davis was surprised at how
many students here went on to
graduate school. In Engiand,
only about 1 per cent of all
college students go on to post-
graduate study. “None of us
could understand,”’ she said.
“Most people here won’t finish
their education till age 26.
That's pushing it.”

As to life in Davidson outside
the classroom, the Ruskies were
mixed in their reactions. It's
easy to get to know people, they
say, but difficult to find things
to do with them. As Davis said,
‘‘When you've done the 900
Room and done the Peregrine
House, you've done Davidson.”

But Mathias disagreed, say-
ing there is “always something

* to do”—and he has indeed been

very busy playing soccer and
traveling to away games to
places such as UNC-G and.
Belmont Abbey. However, the
students said they did fee! a
general sense of isolation here,
and the lack of transportation
made it difficult to get around
as much as they would have
liked.

They were also distressed by
the homogeneity and conformi-
ty they found at Davidson. For
example, Clay said that several
times people had said to her,
“Oh, you must be one of the
English students. You dress so
differently.” Stutter added that
many of the students seemed to
take a great deal of time with
their appearance and yet came
out looking very similar.

And finally, the Rusk scho-
lars said they sensed a certain
lack of spontaneity in the
students here. Our relaxation
periods seem too carefully
planned out, and, Darvill,
noted, we are “reserved about
saying ‘to hell with it.’ "” They
all said that they’ve thoroughly
enjoyed their ten weeks here but
they’d “go mad if we had to
spend four years here.”
