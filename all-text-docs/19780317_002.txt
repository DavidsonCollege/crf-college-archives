Special arants received

Davidson College has received $220,000 in special er=nts from
the Duke Endowment for projects in 1978-79, ranging from faculty

salaries to solar energy.

“The continuing support of the Duke Endowment since its
’ establishment in 1924 has been one of Davidson's most important
sources of strength over the years,” said Davidson President
Sammel R. Spencer Jr. ‘‘In a substantial way Davidson today is an
embodiment of Mr. James B. Duke’s generosity through the

Endowment.

The largest portion of the $220,000 is $150,000 for faculty and
staff compensation and development. The funds will be used
primarily to offset losses in purchasing power caused by inflation,

Spencer said.

Library misses microfilm

An inventory taken over spring break revealed that a large
number of microfilms were missing from the library.

The missing reels included several issues each of The
Davidsonian and The Charlotte Observer.

“Director of the Library Leland Park commented, ‘‘What

someone would do with them without a reader, I can’t imagine.
“Nevertheless, we will probably, for awhile at least, lock all the
cases and heve students ask for access to the cases.”

...Burts accounts
for course enigma

quent rise in enrollment.

A third factor is that course
ceilings may be generally lower.
According to Burts, ‘It might
be true, but I don’t know it to
be true. It is true that in the
history department ceilings
were 40 and are now 30.”

However, Burts felt that
though ceilings may be lower,
they are not as rigid and strict.
Burts said, ‘Now the depart-
ment controls who goes in.”
Burts termed ceilings a ‘‘de-
partmental problem.”’

In an effort to counteract
these problems, Burts wrote a
memorandum to department
chairman before spring break
saying. ‘“‘Don't be surprised at
pressure during add/drop. Be
generous with ceilings. Direct
students to less popular cour-
ses.”

In conjunction with Vice
President of Academic Affairs
T.C. Price Zimmermann, Burts
also started the new procedure
for registering for labs.

Although there are still pro-
blems, Burts feels, ‘‘We've
worked out the major bugs.”

Since the procedure was insti-
tuted just prior to registration,
non-science departments did-
not know about it until after
they had scheduled their cour-
3eS.

The College is also attemp-
ing to reduce the student-

would be to spread out profes-
sors’ absences or to teach more
of the popular courses, although
with the drawbacks of the
latter, ‘‘it’s really a delicate
question” as Burts put it.

Burts also suggested, ‘‘This
is highly speculative, but pos-
sibly there should be more
directing of- when courses
should be taught by the admi-
nistration.”

However, these policy
changes would be up to depart-
ment chairmen and Zimmer-
mann. Zimmermann could not

This term. Independent Stu.
Extended Studies, 301’s
and 401’s are helping to relieve
the shortage of courses. How-
ever, this is overburdening
some professors. In the English
department, most professors
have five individual project
type courses where normally
they should have only two.

Asked if a significant number
of students will be left with only
two courses after add/drop,
Burts replied: ‘‘Based on past
experience, the answer is no.
They'll find something some-
where. I don’t think we'll find it
a real problem.

“There are still a lot of places
in a lot of good courses.”

Also Burts forsees a loo-
sening up of ceilings by the end
of this week.

In the area of athletics,
Brown said he would like to see
“a much greater emphasis on

, women’s sports and the lesser

sports. They are lacking in the
areas of nersonnel and farilitice
especially in comparison with
other major intercollegiate
sports,”’ he explained.

Brown also wants to see

improvement in the recreation

facilities for the general student
boay

Brown plans to investigate
overcrowding problems on Pat-
terson Court. He added that
‘“‘the Senate should decide
guidelines for the use of Rich-
ards and Bailey Houses before
they are vacated for the new
Commons. This should be well
thought out in advance.”

Brown also hopes to get
student input into the admis-
sions process as well as into

decisions on faculty tenure.

“Emphasis on security, fa-
culty-student relations, and
course evaluations will con-
tinne.’’ said Brown

“I plan to continue the good
work we've done so far, as well
as expand the scope of Senate
activities.”

Brown plans to establish
“clearcut and published goals”
for committees in order to
inerease Senate efficiency.

He commended past Senate
administrations for having been
‘‘very efficient.’’ ‘‘We have
‘good guidelines to work on,” he
added.

“With my experience, the
above are all realizable goals,”
Brown concluded.

campaign with the words ‘‘lea-

vation.”

could do a little better.’’
Peeples has served ir the

Senate on the faculty-student

relations committee, the Pat-

Peeples

. terson Court Committee, and

as co-chairman of the Housing
Coramittee.

Although he is no longer in
the Senate, he heads its ‘‘bad
check’’ committee.

Because the role of the
Vice-President “‘is not clearly
defined”’ in the SGA by-laws,
Peeples sees the job as that of
a ‘‘garbage collector.’’ The
Vice-President must deal with
a lot of paperwork and “‘it’s
going to take more hard work
than anything else,’’ says
Peeples.

Since he has ‘‘no large
commitments,”’ he feels that
he has enough time to devote
to the job.

If elected, Peeples would
like to place two students in an
advising post at meeting of
the Board of Trustees. He
does not foresee voting privi-
leges for these students.

Peeples also wants to pro-
mote more SGA-sponsored e-
vents which stimulate faculty-
student interaction.

On Patterson Court, he
would like to push for con-
struction of the Commons and
the release of Richards and
Bailey to upper class eating
houses in the near future.

He sees the need for frater-
nities to be given the right to

extend bids or else follow pure
self-selection because, Peeples
‘says, ‘‘I~am tired of this
wishy-washy business.”

Stiefel believes that student _
government“ should be a fun
thing.” He sees a great need to
get more students involved
and plans to do this through
the Senate newsletter and
increased visitations.

He wishes to improve rela-
tions with the trustees in
cooperation with a strong
President by continuing stu-
dent receptions.

He would like to further
investigate problems such as
dorm overcrowding and the
reason why 400 students re-
ceived less than three classes
during registration this
spring.

Stiefci wants to initiate a
letter-writing campaign by
students to inform future ap-
plicants about Davidson.

He says that the Vice-Presi-
dent should work with the
admissions office to develop
greater diversity among the
student body.

Most importantly, Stiefel
feels that he can offer ‘‘enthu-
siasm, interest, and a positive
outlook”’ to this position. De-
spite having served as Presi-
dent of his freshman class and
senator from his sophomore
class, he thinks that “‘experi-
ence is not a key factor’ as
much as ‘‘a willingness to listen
to people.”’

He emphasizes keeping a
realistic focus on campaign
goals and sees the need for
meetings between students
and candidates for future ele
tions

that’s what I’ve tried to do in
the Senate.”’

Langley cited her work in
providing rides to the airport as
an example. She also helped put
together a resource file on
Mecklenburg County for the
Union.

Langley was a member of a
committee which investigated
Davidson’s overcrowding prob.
lem ‘‘from the eating houses to
parking to the library.”

‘he final report was given to
the Trustees and played a role
in limiting the student body to
1300 and beginning plans for
the new Commons, she said.

Langley has served as Presi-
dent of her freshman and soph-
omore classes, as a junior
senator, and has chaired several
committees.

From her three years’ experi-
ence as a senator, Langley
pointed out the advantage in
“still seeing things from ground
level.”

‘“‘T realized that the most
important thing is for the
senators to be motivated and
enthusiastic,’’ Langley said.
She emphasized the importance
of the President’s delegation of
authority. ‘“‘There’s no way in
the world I can dc everything
on campus. That’s why we have

- senators,” she explained.

“If a President doesn’t try to
do everything himself, it’s
beneficial to the Senate, stu-
dents and faculty alike.’’

Langley wants to re-establish
the Inter-Organizational Fo-
rum. ‘It has proved effective in
the past and it would help
coordinate campus activities
and help us avoid working a-
gainst each other.”’

Langley noted a need for
greater student-faculty co-
operation. ‘‘When students and
faculty join forces we can get a
lot more done.”’

She referred to the tenure
issue as ‘‘a baby step forward”
and speculated another ‘‘step”’
could be made. in .the area of
faculty evaluations.

To increase student motiva-
tion, Langley named several
options the Senate might pur-
sue. ‘‘I would like to see greater
student involvement in the
advisory councils with repre-
sentatives drawn from all as-
pects of the student body.”

“There should be more stu-
dent input into the Senate,’
said Langley. ‘‘People are not
aware they’re welcome to come
to the meetings.”’

Langley has found that the
Senate visitations have a ten-
dency to be negative. She
explained that the visitations
usually collect only problems
and complaints. Langley hopes
to see more positive input come
out of them.

Langley hinted at an idea for
‘task forces for student in-
volvement.”

“The big job of the SGA
President,” said Langley, ‘‘is to
express the student voice.”

“It is especially important 1n
the role as a member of the
Council for Campus and Religi-
ous Life and with the Academic
Vice-President,’ she said
“They should know haw the

uncents feel,"’ she expressed
