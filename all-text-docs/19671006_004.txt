$2500

Over $2500 has been raised
so far in’ the YMCA fund
drive. YMCA President Dick
Lindsey said. Eventual goal
is $3000.

Over $1000 has been con-
tributed by the freshman
class. with 100 per cent con-
tributing on severat halls.

“We are grateful to all
those who gave,” Lindsey
said, ‘“‘and especially to
those who helped with col-
lection.”

The $3500 YMCA budget in-
cludes several special pro-
grams in addition to club ex-
penses. The Y purchases ma-
terials used by STEP. Stimu-
lus. and the scouting pro-
gram. as well as providing
speakers for the Great Is-
“sues program.

The Y also pays transpor-
tation expenses for Davidson
students working in local
churches.’

ROCHESTER. N. Y¥.—Do
college roommates affect
each other’s academic per-
formance?

For certain groups of stu-
dents. the answer is yes, ac-
cording to a study on Room-
mate Choice and Academic
Achievement recently con-
ducted by Robert A. Pierce,
instructor in psychiatry at
the University of Rochester
School of Medicine and clin-
ical psychologist in the uni-
versity’s Student Health Serv-
ice.

Colleges and_ universities
tend to regard the provision
of housing facilties for their
students as a service—per-
haps more for parents than
students—rather than as an
educational tool. Pierce says.

However, housing arrange-
ments do appear to have ed-
ucational implications, ac-
cording to his survey of two
groups of students and their
roommates. He found that
the students in the fall se-
mester of a class in introduc-
tory psychology tended to
achieve at a level similar to
that of their roommates. but
that there were differences
when the group was broken

thieves entered the laundry
through windows on the east
side.

The robbers “knew what
they wanted.”’ according to
Stacks. Most of the shirts
taken were ban-lon knits. he
said, and the trousers were
of “high quality.’

In addition to the clothing,
the thieves took a partially
empty crate of soft drinks
and money from the cash
register. They got about $28
on the first night and $27.25
on the second. Stacks said.

down by sex and by class.

For the overall group. only
men’s achievement levels
were significantly related to
those of their roommates.
Broken down by class, how-
ever, the survey showed that
freshmen, “‘who are for the
most part arbitrarily assign-
ed to each other, tend to ac-
commodate their level of
achievement to that of their
roommates."

Among upperclassmen, who
are free to choose their room-
mates, it appeared that ‘‘men
choose roommates who
achieve similarly to them-
selves .. . while women seem
to pay no attention to this at
all.’’

Repeating the study with
the spring semester class and

their roommates, Pierce
again found that the overall
group tended to achieve at a
level similar to that of their
roommates, as did the fresh-
men.

“But the findings that up-
perclassmen match their lev-
els of achievement even more
closely to that of their room-
mates, or choose roommates
of similar achievement lev-
els, was not borne out in the
second study,” he said.

On the basis of his find-
ings, Dr. Pierce concluded
that “among certain groups
of students. school achieve-
ment correlates positively be-
tween roommates” and that
“overachievement” probably
accounts for a fair portion of
this effect.

(An overachiever was de-
fined in the study as a stu-
dent whose class standing at
at the end of the semester or
of the academic year was
higher than his ability as
measured by College Board
scores.)

The latter conclusion was
based on the fact that of
the roommates pairs whose
achievements were most sim-
ilar, nearly half showed mu-
tual overachievement, rather
than mutual underachieve-
ment, ‘convergence’ (the
brighter student under-
achieved and the less bright
student overachieved), or “‘di-
vergence’ (the brighter stu-
dent overachieved and the
less bright student under-
achieved).

Senior Watches Rioting,
Studies Culture In China

“Hong ‘Kong is every bit
as exotic and mysterious as
the travel posters claim,"
said George Shaw.

A Davidson senior, Shaw
studied last summer at the
University of Hong Kong.

Shaw was part of a group
of 20 American students spon-
sored by Florida Presbyteri-
an College. The group flew
from San Francisco on June
26, stopping for nine days in
Taiwan and then heading for
the University of Hong Kong.

Shaw. a history major, took
a course in Chinese culture
and a seminar on contempo-
rary China. All courses were
taught in English.

Rioting broke out while
Shaw was in Hong Kong.
There was a border clash on
July 8 in which five British
border guards were killed by
the Red Chinese. A group of
leftists bombed some of the
transportation lines.

For two nights the British
declared an 8 p.m. curfew on
the city. The bombing soon
quieted down and peace re-

turned to Hong Kong. Shaw
said that “the riots were
generally overplayed in the
American press.”

Despite the rioting, Shaw
said that the people of Hong
Kong were very friendly and
courteous. He met many
youths of the city at the uni-

versity’s library and the Hong
Kong equivalent of a student
union.

Shaw said that eating with
chopsticks was fun. While in
Hong Kong. he enjoyed such
Chinese dishes as century

Peking duck.
