The lights in front of Cham-
bers and the Christmas trees which
have brightened up the Commons
are not the only decorations that
have helped put Davidson in the
Christmas spirit this past week, as
the annual hall decoration compe-
tition has caused an artistic explo-
sion of yuletide decor.

Fourth Cannon (first in the
outdoor competition and third in
the indoor) and third Richardson
(first in the indoor competition and
third in the outdoor) were the big
winners, bringing in $70 and $60
in prize money, respectively, aside
from having fantastic hall decora-

- tions.

Fourth Watts glorified the
upper classes, placing second in
the outdoor competition and fourth
in the indoor. They were the only
non-freshman hall to place in the
judging.

“T was stunned, to be candid,”

- Ben Klein, Chairman of the Math-
ematics Department and one of the
four judges, said. “They were all
good, and the top ones were spec-
tacular. I had no idea there would
be things quite that astounding.”

The contest, according to
Klein was judged by three criteria:

theme, effort, and the extent to
which the theme was realized in
the decorations. The theme for
third Rich was the Dr. Seuss clas-
sic How the Grinch Stole Christ-
mas, and fourth Cannon used the
North Pole as a theme. Another
interesting theme was encountered
on third east Belk, where the hall
residents threw all their red and
green clothes in the hall and titled
their display “After the party.”

“We deserved it [high place-
mentinthe competition],” Nachette
Carter, a resident of third Rich,
says. “We worked all day. I didn’t
go to class or anything. The whole
hall put in effort, and everybody
contributed. Everyone decided
where it could be improved.”

Carter’s hallmates Kristin
Russo, Stephanie Eichenbrenner,
and Amanda Covington said the
hall came up with the idea for the
Who-ville/Grinch theme as a unit.

“‘We wanted to do something
different, and we were just spitting
out ideas. We were going to go
with the 12 days of Christmas, but
then we came up with this [the
Grinch theme],” they said.

Fourth Cannon used a differ-
ent plan, but came up with similar
results. ;

According to Alexis Wood, a
resident of the hall, the theme was

the last part of decorating.

“Kimberly [Baird] mentioned
something about decorating the
hall. They did snowflakes, and I
said why don’t we put up reindeer.
There are eight partitions in the
hall, so I said why not put up eight
reindeer. The right half was out-
side scenes, and the other was in-
side with a fire and the big cande-
labra. Then, when the judges came
through, we got out our sleeping
bags and had Caroline [Hubbell]
read us a story,” Wood said. “The
theme [North pole] was the last
thing we did.”

The placement in the outdoor
competition was: fourth Cannon,
fourth Watts, third Rich; and in the
indoor competition: third Rich,
Basement Rich, fourth Cannon,
fourth Watts, first Rich, with spe-
cial effort awarded to second West
Belk.: These results display the
dominance freshmen women’s
halls had in this competition.

“T guess the freshmen halls

-are more cohesive,” Klein said.

“They have hall counselors whose
jobitistorally the hall. ButI don’t
really know why there is such a
difference between the men’s and
women’s halls. There was certainly
a glaring disparity. We’d walk
through the women’s halls and see
them decked out, and we’d walk
through Belk and see virtually noth-
ing.”

In addition, Jen Williams, a
resident of fourth Watts, said that
one of the main reasons they did so
well is that the hall was made up
mostly of people that were on the
two freshman halls that won last
year. . ;

“We were all really excited
about doing it again,” she said.
“And everybody really worked to-
gether on it.”

Second west, the lone male
hall to place in the contest, was
decorated mainly, according to hall
residents, by Stowe Beam and
James Baird.

“We are very proud of Stowe
and James’ room,” Saad Gul, one

of the hall counselors, said. “They
decorated together, and it was a
very good effort on their part.”

The halls all have different
ideas on how they are going to
spend their prize money.

Fourth Watts plans to spend
part of it to send Christmas cards to
troops in Bosnia and may give
some money toa soup kitchen or to
wrap or buy presents for needy
children, according to Williams.

Third Rich, after they pay for
the things that they bought, is go-
ing to have a Christmas party, ac-
cording to Covington, Russo, and
Eichenbrenner.

according to Wood.

“The competition is a lot of
fun. It helped my hall get together
and decorate for the holidays. It is
great to do something fun before
finals, and it’s also nice to come up
to the hall and relax and feel a little
at home. The girls will probably
start getting homesick a little now
and want to go home, so it will be
nice to have the decorations,” said
Amy Lindstrom, a hall counselor
on second Cannon.

The judges were Klein, Bill
Felty (Career Services), Carissa
Jakob (Chemistry), and Annette
Reagan (Dean of Students).
