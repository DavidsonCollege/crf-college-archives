DR. CANNON, OF ST. LOUIS,
KILLED BY AUTOMOBILE

Struck by Car in Front of Home.
Dies Within Few Hours.

Rev. James F. Cannon, D.D., pas-
tor of the Westminster Presbyterian
Church, of St. Louis, Mo., was struck
and killed by an automobile in front
of his own home on the afternoon of
March 12. The details of the acci-
dent are not known other than the
fact that he lived until 8 o’clock that
night.

Dr. Cannon was born in Cabarrus
county, North Carolina, January 3

He attended Davidson Col-

lege, from which he graduated in'|’ye searched the town of Davidson, P

1869. His first pastorate was the

church of Leesburg, Va., where he!

remained for eight years.- He then
served the church of Shelbyville,
Tenn., for seven years. In 1888, Dr.
Cannon became pastor of the Grand
‘Avenue Church (now the Westmin-
ster Church) of St. Louis, Mo.,
which he continued to serve until
his death. A brilliant man in col-
lege, and a zealous Christian in his
every-day life, Dr. Cannon has en-
deared himself to all those with
whom he has come in contact.

It is worthy to note that Dr. Can-
non is the second member of his
class to die within two weeks, Col.
A. R. Banks, of Cofumbia, S. C., pre-
ceding him. It may also be of note
that this class of 1869 made the
highest average of any class in Da-
vidson history, averaging about 98.

FIRM IN SPARTANBURG

J. S. Wingo is now head of the
firm of J. S. Wingo & Co., of Spar-

H. B. Elliott, ’°18, now of Char-'
lotte, visited his parents in Davidson! But still at the rainbow’s end there, go forward or we go back. Better

last Sunday. Though the campus
has long been a familiar sight to
“Harry,” he never fails to avail him-
self of an opportunity to come back.

Andrew Brown, ’17, was on the
Hill last week. He is now located
in Ripley, Miss.

Union, as they were at Davidson. |
During their stay at Davidson they
were not only among the leaders in|
class and literary society work, but
also in “Y” work and volunteer
work. A striking coincidence is that
both of them are ex-presidents of
the college Y. M.C. A.

These men have returned to their
studies at Richmond, but they leave
behind them a powerful influence
which will be felt in the councils of
the various organizations and in the
minds of the men on the campus for
many a day.

RAINBOW GOLD.

, The pot of gold at the rainbow’s foot

' Was a legend of childhood days—
‘A fairy story we took for truth—

And we followed, with a wistful

gaze,

The glittering arch to the purple

hills,
Where it faded away from sight,
But the mystic gold to our childish

es
Was fadeless and pure and bright.

But that shining goal we could never
reach—

’Twas always so far away,
And the shadows came on the dis-
' tant hills

And the rainbow tints turned gray.
But we never despaired, and we
| never could doubt, ;

And our hopes of wealth ran high,
For that pot of gold we could always:

see

When the rainbow spanned the
sky. \
t
The fancies of childhood have long’
since passed,
And gone are the dreams of old,
lies ;
The fabled pot of gold—
The goal that we strive for, but may

not win,
As bitterly we confess—
The aim of ambition’s high desires |
And a measure of brief success.

I would be true, for there are those |
who trust me; ;

I would be pure, for there are
those who care;

I would be strong, for there is much!
to suffer ; :

I would be brave, for there is much
to dare. '

I would be a friend to all—the foe—'
the friendless; |

I would be giving, and forget the

EVAPORATION.

We've all heard of fuel conser-—
vation and food conservation, but
this is the latest. The other day we
dropped into the office of a local in-
surance agent and found him busily
engaged in writing a letter, though
he took time between each dip of:
the pen to replace the stopper in his
ink bottle.

are W. G. Summerville, 16, and J. L.
Fowle, ’18. They came as the selec-

Union Seminary, for the purpose of
stirring up interest in the work of
spreading the Word of God and the
undertaking of the ministry as a
life work. As to the success of their
mission, it can safely be said that it
was supremely so.
