Case Of The Hidden $

If you gave money to the Negro
scholarship .fund drive last spring,
don't worry just because you haven't
heard anything about it. It’s resting
safely in a state of limbo between col-
lection and employment in the bank
across the street.

The money, slightly over $2,000,
is deposited in the names of Larry
Slade and Joe Murphy, two of the
drive’s leaders, and apparently these
two are planning to put it to use.
Precisely how is still an open question,
though.

The fund drive, prompted by a
challenge from Dr. W. G. Workman
last spring, was intended to raise
enough money to award a full scholar-
ship to a Negro member of the Class
of 1973. Unofficially, though, it was
to serve as a talking point for recruit-
ing Negro students to come to David-
son.

In some respects the drive flopped.
Some students who should have been
its most avid supporters. weren’t. The
$2,400 needed to meet Dr. Workman’s
challenge grant of $100 was not raised.
No money was solicited from any
faculty meniber.

The class of 1968 did not give their
Senior Class Gift to the drive, as they
had promised. And no effort has been
made this fall to collect those pledges
which went: uncollected last spring.

But there is another side, too. More
than a third of the student body con-
tributed to the fund, and more than
a fourth gave five dollars or more.
Besides being an indication of some
student support, it demonstrates clear-
ly that many Davidson students are
willing to put their money where their
mouth is.

What we need now is a little more
“mouth.” Gary Henschen, director of
student recruiting, has organized an
ambitious program to present to high
school students, including many Negro
students. Slade, in turn, plans to get
a list of outstanding Negro high school

students. Only they have never bother-
ed to mention their plans to each
other. The need for coordination and
cooperation is obvious.

Only slightly less obvious is the
need for many more students to put
their mouth where their money is.
Anybody who gave money to the fund
drive should also be willing to spend
a couple of hours visiting the pre-
dominantly Negro high schools in his
town. if his motives were sincere in
the first place.

Equally pressing is the need to
follow up on last spring’s plans to
seek foundation support for Negro
recruitment. Six months ago, it seem-
ed feasible. Why not now?

The money is across the street,
waiting to be used. And it can be used,
in a number of ways. As it is now,
it’s certainly not doing Davidson's
woeful admissions program any good.

So, Vote

We're not going to give you all
that jazz about how it’s your right and
duty to vote in the upcoming Senate
and Residence Hall Council! elections.

The fact is, we don’t give a damn
whether you vote or not.

The old right-and-duty line is a
lot of bunk. It’s just as much your
right not to vote as it is your right to
vote. If you choose not to vote at all,
that’s your business.

But consider this: at least half the
guys running for positions will un-
doubtedly be so much deadwood, if
past elections are any indication. Some
of them will get elected, too.

Now we're not suggesting that
your vote by itself will keep an in-
competent out of office. But at least
later on, when somebody’s cutting
meetings and shirking his duty, you'll
have the small satisfaction of know-
ing you voted against him.

Political Nothingness

We've been saying all along that
a lot of Tar Heel politicians are say-
ing nothing constructive this year, and
this week we came up with some evi-
dence to prove it.

In the mail the other day was a
news release from Bill Osteen, Repub-
lican candidate for Congress from the
State’s sixth district. We know noth-
ing about him except his political
affiliation and the fact that he’s run-
ning against Richardson Preyer, who
just happens to be chairman of the
Davidson Board of Visitors. And we
hold neither fact against him.

It was a typical political news re-

“ lease: up at the top an attractive red

and black heading with a sketch of
the American eagle. The candidate’s
name in bold black letters. And his
campaign headquarters’ address and
phone number in smaller print.

‘It was typical except for one thing:
the rest of the sheet was blank. A
campaign worker’s slip-up, no doubt.

We have no way of knowing, of
course, what Osteen’s release was sup-
posed to say. And we don’t really care
to know either. For if the words of
other North Carolina candidates this
fall are any indication, whatever Os-
teen might have had to say would
probably have the approximate value
of a blank sheet of paper.

Anties With Semantics

This is a year for name-calling.

Any time a candidate can’t think
of anything substantial to say—and
this fall it happens every day—he
cranks out some nasty little label in-
Stead. “Squishy soft,” “Fearless Fos-
dick,” “Tricky Dick” and “fourth-
rate political hack” are a few that
come to mind.

We wonder what would happen if
we took the time to redefine two of
the labels that are being bandied about
quite a lot this year: “patriot” and
“activist.”

What if we decided, for instance,
that a patriot was one who was not

afraid to engage in civil rights demon-
strations and other controversial acti-
vities because he felt the future of
his country rested on his immediate
concern and action?

And what if we decided an activist
was one who always takes the militant
stand—against communism, hippies,
demonstrators or anything else he
disapproves of at the moment?

Interesting twist of semantics? It
points out how the emotive content
of some common terms exceeds their
rational content. We can always hope
that people will be rational when they
vote next month.

Where Hippies Shave

From The Greensboro Daily News

Fidel Castro is up to his cigar in -
trouble again. This time it isn’t capi-
talist jackals or Yanquis or even
Russians. This time it's hippies.

What? Hippies in Havana? Si! Even
there. Teenage boys and girls are
burning the Cuban flag, tearing down
government posters, looking weird

Thanks Again

Communication between student
body and administration has never
reached such a low point that anyone
ever seriously considered storming the
president’s office or barricading him-
self in Chambers. And a chief reason
has been the attitude of the adminis-
tration itself.

The men in Chambers who run the.
college have never let their jobs inter-
fere too long with their interest in the
student. body, as we saw again last
weekend at the administration-served
breakfast in the Union.

The whole affair was a big hit, and
we thank the administration crew that
participated. The sight of the dean of
the faculty in a gold uniform and car-
rying a tray is enough to destroy any
Sunday morning hangover.

and generally exhibiting declining
morals,

Their behavior is un-Cuban and un-
Communist. They are even destroying
pictures of revolutionary leader Che
Guervara who, ironically, is something
of a folk hero to gringo hippies of the
New Left.

Perhaps a youthful rebellion is to
be expected in a country where the
prime minister has a beard and wears
old army fatigues, but Fidel Castro is
upset. To combat the hippies he has
taken some lessons from politicians
and bureaucrats in ‘the United States.

First, he would require the teen-
agers to stay in school until they are
old enough to calm down. For those
who insist upon dropping out Castro
has a General Hershey plan to order
compulsory military service for boys
between 14 and 17. That's fourteen
years old. Finally, he is appealing for
help from Cuba’s neighborhood vigi-
lante groups called “Committees for
the Defense of the Revolution.”

But why are there hippies in Cuba?
What has caused the rebellion of the
young? The other day Fidel Castro
gave the answer to a mob of vigilantes.
The young Cubans, he said, are vic-
tims of “imperialist propaganda.”

Now where did we last hear an
explanation like that?

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Beanie Rule Rapped;
Yankees Like ’Dixie’

To The Editor:

This letter will take some-
what the form of a lament
for the loss of reason and
compassion from the stud-
ent body on the fssue of
freshman regulations.

I was impressed at first by
the seeming enlightenment
of upperclassmen here. But
I see that it only took ¢
couple of water fights to pee
off the gentle veneer and ex-
pose a latent animosity.

Joe Murphy is now quoted
to the effect that if freshmen
indulge in water fights, they
should be made to wear
beanies as a punishment.

This may be the more po-
litically tenable stand, three-
fourths of the student body
net being freshmen, but it
is completely unreasonable.

I simply submit (1) water
fights were staged even in
the days when freshmen
wore beanies, (2) those fights
were much more violent, ac-
cording to the janitors, and,

hence, (3) there is no rela-:

tion between the wearing of
beanies and the occurrence
or frequency or quality of
water fights.

I therefore conclude that

freshmen wear beanies is.

not really a crime preven.
tive’ measure, and that it
should not be called puish-

ment, but revenge. Let's call
a spade a spade.

To The Editor:

re was ‘Dixie’? The
Pep Band did an excellent
job on such snappy selec-
tions as ‘Mission Impossible”
and otber songs designed to
whip the crowd to a fevor —
but no “Dixie.”

Musically, ‘‘Dixie’’ jis a
real emotion-raiser; if that
isnt enough, then what has
happened to tradition? This
is “DIXIE” — not the song
of the rednecked Wallacite
South of the carpetbaggers,
but the song of Robert E.
Lee's South; a reminder of

the beauty that once was, but
was ruthlessly destroyed by
some of the most dim-sight-
ed fools of politicians and
generals in our country’s his.
tory.

Traditions were broken last
weekend; traditions which for
the most part badly .need-
ed breaking. We were away
last year and were gladden-
ed at the sight of the “new”
Davidson upon our return.

Maybe you didn't »lay
Dixie’ last year: we don't
know. But please, as north-
ern Davidsonians we beg
you, dont give up ‘‘Dixie’’!!

Sparrow Calls
Blue Sky ‘Hoax’

To The Editor:

I get a little tired of hear-
ing all this talk about David.
son's ‘‘new curriculum.” Lets
not be fooled. There is no
new curriculum.

School this year is most.
ly like school last year.
School at Davidson is most-

Jasper Wonders
Where Spencer Is

To The Editor:

“Sam who?”
“Spencer, Samuel Spenc-
er.”

“Oh, yes. Now I remem-

ber. A real good ‘guy—head

on his shoulders, both feet
on the ground. He's in my
Bible class and. .”’

“No, no, he’s not a fresh-
man, he's president of David-
son.””

“Well, what's this presi-
dent guy look like?”

“I don't know exactly, no
one’s seen him. There was
a rumor that he was the
cause of some applause at
chapel, at least according
to the Observer.”

“‘Oh, now I remember. He's
the one who looks like a
Chicago bookmaker. Do you
think he'd give me odds on
the Furman game?"

“Forget it! The president
is too occupied to play
bookie.”

"But President Martin used
to throw frisbees and wander
about the Union and use the
laundry and drink cokes in
The Hub. What's Spencer
busy doing?"

“Well, no one knows but
he must be doing something
since he’s never seen on
campus. Wait a minute! He
was on campus last week
to get sworn in as president.”

“That's it?"

“What do you expect? He's
out raising money, talking
to trustees and getting his
name in the paper.

“You mean I'll never get
to meet him?"

“Oh, yes, at commence.
ment. He'll be the one up
front giving out diplomas
and telling you how great
it was knowing the students.’

“*Gosh-o-gee, it's really
swell having such a close
relationship. Why at a large
university you'd never get
to meet the president unless
you were a fraternity broth-
er or attacked him in print.
Here at Davidson everyone is
equal — no one sees him.
That's true democracy in
action.”

“Lower your voice! Some-
one might be snooping
around.”

“O.K., let's go somewhere
quiet and deserted where we
can't be disturbed.”

‘How ‘bout the president's
office. Just be careful you
don't trip."

“Over what?"

“Cobwebs! Only keep your
voice down!" —

“Get serious. At Davidson
a person's allowed to say
anything on his mind. That's
called ‘academic freedom’.
Why, ministers are allowed
to call down a wrathful God
to attack the CRAP report
and students are permitted
to cut up the football team,
Davidson's own Atlanta Fal-
cons.”’

“Things must be chang-
ing...”

“They certainly are. Last
year I actually met a trustee
and maybe if I'm a good
little boy. this year I might
even get to see a president
... from afar.”

Al Jasper, '69

ly like school anywhere else
in the U.S.A.

We still operate from the
basig idea that some people
(professors and authors)
have a commodity (educa-
tion) which they sell to us
students in different pack-
ages (lectures, discussion
groups, pages of reading,
seminars, adding up to cour-
ses and credits).

The ‘‘new curriculum" is
simply a new packaging plan
for an old product, with a
few optionals added to make
it sell better.

We continue to believe that
the “search for truth’. is
best carried on in seclusion
and detachment. Diploma,
grad school, corporation job
are still the goals.

We talk about breaking out
but we have not seriously
challenged these traditional
ideas. We (I mean “we in
an institutional sense) have
not asked any basic questions
about learning or the role of
the college in our society.

But this isn't a call for
more studies. While out of
school I learned something
about change and how it
happens. Davidson College
committees aren't going to
do it. I only say let’s not
fool ourselves. The new cur-
riculum is a hoax.

Revolt Of The Rednecks

“I’m going to vote for Wallace because he is the
only real alternative to the present rotten situation.”
This was not the twanged speech of a Georgia cracker,
nor the slow drawl of a Louisiana farmer.

It came from a college graduate who lives in the
suburbs of Washington. And he wuld probably turn
as red as some of his compatriots’ necks if he knew
anyone recorded his conversation.

y By now it is trite to say that George C. Wallace
is the strongest third party candidate since Theodore
Roosevelt. In the last few months, the little man from
Alabama has fulfilled his promise to shake the eye-
teeth of the liberals. ;

Perhaps his greatest victory came a few weeks
ago when the New York Times, that great gray spokes-
man of Eastern liberalism, told the world that Wallace
might poll more electoral votes than Hubert Humphrey.

Were the election held today, some observers
believe the fears of one Tennessee politican might come
true: Humphrey would throw. the election into the
House. It seems Wallace and Nixon have awakened the
sleeping giant that Goldwater never quite stirred.

No doubt the press can claim a share of the blame.
Too long have writers in New York and Chicago failed
to realize that the Southern white as well as the Negro
is a product of forces over which he had no control.

The racist cop in Baton Rouge needs help just
like the black sharecropper in Marks, Miss. But now
the rube in Iredell County can make even the New
York Times quiver. He can feel frustration just like
the black militant. But unlike the militant, the poor
white now has a spokesman whose voice is louder than
any underground newspaper, and whose impact will
burn longer than the fires of Washington.

For as Eric Severeid once said, the New Politics
is not that of Eugene McCarthy or Channing Phillips.
It is of George Wallace and the radical right. For
it is the right, not the left, that has a place on nearly
every ballot in the country. It is the right, not the left,
which threatens to outdistance the nominee of the
largest party in the nation.

Some say this is because the left is disenchanted
and has dropped out of the election. But why did it
leave? Because it was ultimately rejected by a nation
which is marching “eyes right.”

Those who say Wallace’s movement will be short-
lived have not read the signs. The effects of the former
governor will be felt, particularly in the South, for
a generation. ’

The first effect will probably be a great wave of
support to abolish the Electoral College. That body
which has long given disporportionate voice to min-
orities like the Negroes and the Irish now pays its
due to the “redneck”’.

And this is cause for alarm in many circles. For,
of course, the reason Wallace stands to do well in the
Electoral College is because his strength is concentrat-
ed among several states.

in the long run, however, the Wallace surge has
shown the world how shallow the progressivism of
“The New South” really is. For in North Carolina,
once considered the most progressive Southern state,
no olitician dares speak disparagingly of George

allace.

The American Independent Party doubtless won’t
someday replace one of the major parties. It may not
even exist in four years. But it will not have died. Like
the Progressive Party of an earlier era, its philosophy
will implant itself into the system, for better or for
worse. It’s time we prepared ourselves for this in-
evitability.

“I's All Right, But | Wish You Had Chosen A Different Base.”
