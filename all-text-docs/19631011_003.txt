FOOTBALL’S BACK...

; The sun finally was out and the game began at two
o'clock. It was the first typical football day at Davidson
this year. A little warm but still a typical football day.

Then aga
Davidson. VMI, the pre-season favorite to win the South-
ern Conference title, had been beaten the week before
by Iowa State. The Keydets had outgained a team which
is definitely considered a major college power. And Dav-
idson was probably as far down emotionally and physical-
ly as a Davidson team has been in the past few years.

When VMI took the field there was something about
the gold helmets and snappy pre-game drills that made
— like a football team that expects to win. They

idn't.

The game’s over and everything has been hashed!
and re-hashed. If you missed the action, then you missed |
a great effort by a football team which made too many |
mistakes to win but would not let themselves be beaten. |

No one man stood out for Davidson Saturday. Steve

it was such names as Bruce Dalton, Tom Simmons, Steve
Smith .and others who, although they have seen little
action previously this year, filled in more than adequate- |
ly for some of the injured ‘Cats.

Another couple of names have to be mentioned.
David Sprinkle intercepted one pass, broke up several
more and time after time came up from his corner spot
to stop ball carriers for no gain.

Pat Fisher played his usual steady un-noticed game
at fullback, but it was on defense Saturday that he shone,
time after time wiping out the interference on the power |
sweeps.

There were other defensive standouts as well as
offensive notables. And perhaps most important of them
all was Jim Terry who personally provided four of David-
son’s points with his toe

ON THE MOVE

Goalie Lyman Dillon and his fullbacks threw a shut-
out at big bad Carolina Wednesday. The line provided |
three goals as the soccer team continued its winning ways. |

Perhaps it is too early to begin thinking of national |
recognition, but right now it appears that Davidson is as
strong as any team in this area with the possible excep-
tion of Duke.

Next Wednesday the Wildcats journey to Durham
to tackle Duke University. A victory against Duke could
provide Davidson a chance to get into the Eastern region-
als.

\ Tie With Powerful VMI

Last week the VMI Keydets confidently marched into Richardson Field a 30 point
favorite, expecting nothing more difficult than an afternoon drill. Instead they en-
countered a fired-up Wildcat team and were fortunate to retreat with a tie.

Playing against heavy odds,
Davidson came up with an in-
spired team effort. VMI, confer-
ence champions, had to struggle
hard for the split decision
Coach Bill Dole remarked, “It
would be unfair to our person-
nel to pin-point individuals and
say that they were responsible
for this tie because every mem-
ber of the team contributed and
put out a wonderful effort.”

The ‘Cat defense did a great
job of containing the Keydets,
holding them scoreless in the
first half. The VMI offense was
forced into costly mistakes in-
cluding five fumbles. three of

them inside the Davidson 11-
yard line. The ‘Cats were par

When Johnson has time to spot

While tied for third place with
a 42 record, the Sigma Chis
have no real standouts. Their
record has been earned with
good team play and a competi-
tive spirit that seems to wear
down their opponents.

The ATO’s, tied for third place
with practically everybody else,
seem to have one of the fastest
teams in the league. Dick Whit-

fensive linemen, have been in-

Junior fullback Lyle Blalock
playing his first game of the
season, scored early in the sec-
ond half. It was set up by re-

Davidson 27. Blalock is fully
recuperated from his pre-season
shoulder injury and is expected
to see action in all subsequent
games.

Behind 10-0, VMI scored and

the third quarter. With 4:45 re-

Sophomore Jim Terry took
over the kicking duties and put
4 of Davidson’s 10 points on
the board by his field goal and
extra point.

A big bright spot was the
punting game. Steve Heckard
and Jim Fuller combined their
efforts for a 39 yard average in
seven kicks. This was despite
one punt which went for only a
few yards.

The major weakness revealed
in the game is the ’Cat air of-
fense. Only one of 10 attempts
was completed for a mere six
yard total. The passing game
will receive a lot of attention in
the next two weeks. Also, care-
less mistakes continue to plague
the team. Davidson lost the ball
three times on fumbles and
twice through intercepted pass-

As expected, the Davidson de-
fense proved itself more than
equal to the task of containing
the Lees-MeRae offense. In the
second half the ‘Kitten defense

tion, allowing the opposition
