Duke outruns Cats
In opening contest

By DAVE KELLER

Coach Sterling Martin’s
cross countrymen dropped
their first meet of the year
Saturday as they fell to the
ACC champions Duke Blue
Devils 44-19 on the Davidson
course.

In the race, which was by
mutual agreement five miles
instead of the usual six, the
Cats only managed to take
three of the top ten places:
Doug Horne in second with
27:05, Ed Anderson in ninth
with 28:51 and Zack Murrell in
tenth with 28:55.

Martin was pleased with his
team’s times, however, espe-
cially considering the fact that
practice had only been under-
way for a week.

Facing what can only be
called a rebuilding year, Mar-
tin is pessimistic about the
upcoming year.

“We suffered heavily with
graduation losses and the
surprise absenses of Coty Pin-
ckney and Dick Boehner, and
we have only two returning
lettermen: Horne and Steve
Justus,’’ he said.

Other members of the team
include Jay Silver, Biff Um-
hau, and freshmen George
Strobel, Jeff Morrow and Pat
Jenevein.

In the past, the cross coun-
try squad has been one of the
more victorious teams at Dav-
idson, posting 7-5, 9-3 and
10-8 records the past three
years. This year is different.

As Martin says, ‘‘This is
definitely our hardest cross
country schedule ever at
Davidson; with a young un-
tried team like this we can
only hope for a few victories
and a lot of good experience.”’

The Cats’ next action will be
the annual Stone Mountain
Road Race in Atlanta on
Saturday, and future meets
include contests with William
and Mary (Southern Confer-
ence champions for the past
ten years), Furman, the Univ-
ersity of Richmond and App-
alachian State.  —_-

The next home’neet will be

a five-way meet on October 2,
where Martin expects his team
to finish second behind Pem-
broke.

Along with cross country
this year there will be organ-
ized fall track practice. Martin
urges anyone who plans to run
on the team this spring to see
him soon.

Also, any women interested
in either running cross country
with the men this fall or
organizing a women’s team for
the, winter and spring seasons
should see Martin in his
Johnston gym office.

The Davidson College IMAC Flickerball season com-
mences Wednesday with all its thrills, chills and assorted
spills.
