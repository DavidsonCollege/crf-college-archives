(Continued From Page 5)

One student put it this way: ‘“‘Perhaps I have read a poem or a
short story, an essay by Kierkegaard, a chapter from Nietzche's
“Zarathustra.”

‘Something in my mind has been stimulated by the reading, but I
am confused, baffled by the complexity of the thought. I find
another who feels as I do, and together we find a third. We want to
talk now. We open a beer or two, and as the beer loosens our
tongues, we begin to pour out our thoughts, share our insights,
argue our differences. I contribute my insights and receive those of
my friends.

‘Together our reading of these works is infinitely richer than my
solitary reading would have been. I read a play but I cannot seem to
grasp the essential nature of the characters: I need to hear the dif-
ferent voices. I find some friends, and together we sit down and
read it aloud. We play different roles. We finish the play, and then
begin to talk about it. Soon the play takes on new life for us.

‘At the same time our friendship grows, and our own personal
relationships take on new dimensions. Having talked about religion
and philosophy and literature, we have revealed something of our-
selves to one another and found depths in one another that we did
not know existed." ‘

The kind of scene this student describes is too rare on college
campuses. Students will not begin to enjoy college genuinely until
this kind of experience becomes the rule rather than the exception.
Life closes in rapidly upon the young man or woman. Marriage, the
raising of children, the pressure of jobs, obligations to the com-
munity — all- of these things come to dominate one’s time in the
years after college.

The college years are unique in that they offer a young man
four unencumbered years for personal growth'and reflection; they
should not be unhappy years.

The college experience can be an immensely rich and rewar-
ding one if students and teachers together approach it with the idea
that learning is a communal experience, that growth comes only as
one gives as well as receives, and that the worst kind of im-
prisonment is not physical incarceration but solitary confinement
within the prison walls of the self.

College, Church Join Forces,

New Minister Will Serve Both

Davidson College and the
Davidson College Presbyterian
Church will begin a partnership
in campus ministry in June with
the employment of an assistant
minister for the church who will
also serve as minister to
students on campus.

He is Rush W. Otey III, 26,
now completing studies for the
new doctor of ministry degree
at Union Theological Seminary
in Richmond.

In a joint statement, the Rev.
John B. Rogers, pastor of the
church, and College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. ex-
plained that in past years the
college has employed chaplains.
ho minister to students and to
advise the student YMCA.

‘*Previous arrangements
have had a major shortcoming
in that the chaplain had no base
of operations,’’ Rogers and
Spencer said. ‘‘He did not
belong either to the college
faculty or to the Davidson
church.

“This new experiment in
campus ministry will secure for
the campus minister an identity
with the visible church.

‘‘Most importantly it will
provide the opportunity for an
entire congregation, not just
one man, to minister to the
students on campus,”’ the

statement said.

Rogers and Spencer noted
that the college's Statement of
Purpose says in part, ‘Since its
founding (in 1837) the ties which
bind the College to the
Presbyterian Church have
remained close and strong....
The primary loyalty of the
college extends beyond the
bounds of denomination to the
Christian community as a
whole, through which medium
it would seek to serve the
world.”

He has also had field ex-

Virginia churches.

His salary will be paid by the
college and the church will
provide office space.
