THE ie

Problem i is Davidson siden” social pit not Greek organizations

So sororiti
son College. ,Or they are not.

Or they are coming with some
rush process that works with existing
self-selection policy. Or they are not
because women here will not be able to
handle a national sorority’s elitist, ex-
clusive nature.

Or they are because women need
the equal opportunity of a nationally
connected women’s organization.

Or they are not because the en-
tire Greek system of Patterson Court
is slowly being dissolved, so what’s
the point in delaying the inevitable by
bringing more Greeks here?

What I have read and heard in the
past month disturbs me. The idea of
sororities at Davidson may excite only
certain people, but except for one or
two lone Op-Ed writers, only those who
are opposed seem to make their voices
heard.

In all but one of my classes, I’ve
sat and listened to independents attack
the current Pattérson Court system, as
well as the organizations which com-
prise it.

I’ve heard people make the logi-
cally questionable jump of, ‘“‘We don’t
need sororities, so why not do away

coming to David-

with fraternities as well?”

I’m not so sure that we don’t need
sororities, even though they will not
affect me in any possible way. They
won’t offer me an international net-
work of current members and alumni,
they won’t offer me a close-knit group
of friends (but, of course, I already
have both), and most importantly, they

STUDENT OPINION -

John Blake —

won’ t affect my social life.

And they won’t affect anyone
else’s either. The social scene at David-
son is seen by many to be inadequate.
Well, of course it is.

Most Davidson students lack the
necessary social skills to make it work
like it does at many other schools of
similar size.

I have friends in every house, ev-
ery organization, every dorm, and ev-
ery class — in every nook and cranny
that is Davidson. From people who
never leave the library, to people who
don’t know what color the carpet is
inside.

I choose my friends, and I am a
member of an “elitist” and “exclusive”
organization. Everyone chooses their
friends, and with them, the social circles
they will move in for the four years of
life we sacrifice to Davidson. The addi-
tion of another “exclusive” -club won’t
change life here that much, so “chang-
ing the face of the Davidson social scene”
should be a non-issue.

But what about this
idea of anelitist, exclu-
sive club that the aver-
age Davidson student
seems to hate so much?
I implore people to check their direction
and their surroundings before throwing
invalid words into their opinions.

Of course, Davidson as a whole
can be categorized as elitist, given the
price tag of a four-year education here.

There are people at Davidson who
are not elitist, and I guarantee you that
many of them are in fraternities. The
whole idea of elitism should be moot as
well, because it does not exist if people
do not allow it to.

Elitism is not caused only by exclu-
sive organizations. Those who are ex-
cluded and who believe themselves in-
ferior in some way to the exclusive group

create elitism, because they allow it to
exist as truth.

Davidson students fall into the trap
of low self-esteem, creating some pretty
impressive inferiority complexes, and
this is the basis for polarization be-
tween the “elitist” organizations,” and
everyone else.

The exclusivity question is a bit
more complex. Maybe women who are
opposed to having even the option of
sororities think that having an exclu-
sive organization will limit how many
activities they will be able to put on
their resumes.

Maybe it comes down to the Uto-
pian ideal that Davidson embraces so
poorly of acceptance and equity. Self-
selection for Davidson men is a myth.
That is an undisputed fact.

Of course, with the size of our
institution, it is easier to get bids from
fraternities here than at a big school, if
students are willing to take an hour a
week in the fall to visit the fraternities
and get to know the brothers.

The brotherhoods might make the
ultimate decision, but getting bids is
about selling yourself to the fraternity
on the qualities that they embrace.

It’s really not that hard, but prob-

lems arise when the average Davidson
students lacks the social skills and con-
fidence to do this. With the people we
have here, it could be the same for
sororities.

Despite what everyone has heard
(and obviously not experienced) about
sororities, Davidson’ s Statement of Pur-
pose is echoed by every Greek organi-
zation in existence.

If we, as members of the college
community, support and actively pur-
sue the goals of our own Statement of
Purpose, why: would life with more
organizations that reinforce the back-
bone of our college be any different
with sororities and fraternities?

It is the quality of the people that
give an organization its qualities. We
have the caliber of women to make
sororities work.

As for whether or not the. women
of Davidson can handle sororities, I’m
not touching that one with a 40-foot
pole. ,

I know there are women here who
can handle an exclusive organization,
both those who will join, and those who
will not.

They’re the women who read this
article and didn’t get angry.

I got a good haircut, and it’s not because of the way it looks

I believe I got a glimpse on Satur-
day of how good a slower and smaller
life can be. It happened while I got a
two-hour haircut.

Now, [have always been skeptical
as to the ability of minor experiences to
somehow relate much about larger
themes or equally capture the emotion
as larger, continuous events. Even most
authors or poets who focus on just one
day or just a couple of hours usually
describe the effects of larger trends or

‘themes and how they happen to have
affected their subject during a -particu-
lar short time.

I guess I have never seen life as
rich enough to be appropriately cap-
tured in sucha vignette-like state. How-
ever, there are exceptions to every rule,
and I was lucky enough to get a viola-
tion of this one.

Usually when I go to Raeford’s
Barber Shop, the wait is not too long
and the haircut only so-so. (Sometimes,
it’s worse —I do not usually wear acap,
but Raeford at times forces such a fash-
ion change upon me.) However, I con-
tinue to go-out of tradition and habit.

Most of the time, Raeford says
little and the whole experience is un-
eventful, save for the unpredictable re-
sult of the haircut.

But the last time I went, there were
quite a few people in front of me and I
had to wait. At Raeford’s, where the
average haircut takes half an hour, I
knew my afternoon would have been

sacrificed looking at the line of six
people.

But, after hearing Peter
Goldmark’s Convocation talk prepar-
ing us for the “new” faster, global,
economically driven world, I decided
to spend a little time in the old, closer,
slower, locally driven one that remains
at Raeford’s. As the introduction hints,
the result was pleasing.

- To kill time, I started up conver-
sations with the other guys who also
decided to spend their afternoon at the

‘barber shop. The first guy was talking

about his ‘83 Mercedes 190, which had
some 190,000 miles on it and never
gave him trouble.

I asked him why Mercedes would
not want to have planned obsolescence
on their cars, so that they could sell
more; and he simply told me they were
not like American companies that way
— Mercedes actually cared about qual-
ity and building a good product.

OK, maybe I was not going to
learn much about the “old” economy
today, I thought, for here was a guy
who I thought would definitely “Buy
American!” criticizing our country’s
most profitable industrial product.

Raeford chimed in, saying that he just
sold his Mercedes 290, which had
210,000 miles on it, for a “fine amount
of dollars.”

Well, I guess I will look at the
Mercedeses a little more differently than
as signs of affluence now. For, at least
when new, they are “durable” sign of
affluence.

The next guy I talked with simply
had a good story to tell. We started to
discuss his job as a pipe-fitter. I asked
him if it was a Union job, and he af-
firmed, telling me he received $14 an
hour during most of his employment.

He then told me how that job disap-
peared and he decided to work for the
nuclear power plants that

than Germany’s — which, of course,
has not really been constructing new
fighter planes since then.

During this conversation, a guy
came in and asked Raeford how long
the wait might be. He replied, “Maybe
one hour or so.” The man answered,
saying that he would just as rather drive
30 miles to Charlotte and go to a place
there rather than wait. (He might have
saved a total of 15 minutes, I figured.)

At that point, Raeford’s partner in
barbering, Mr. Downs, justified the ex-
istence of places like Raeford’s by stat-
ing, “Well, (the wait) is why you come
here.”’ Everybody in the shop laughed,
understanding the truth in the state-

economically driven actor should do in
the “new” world.

However, Raeford knows other
people do that and he is happy deliver-
ing a product the market says he should
not. [left Raeford’s knowing a lot more
about cars, nuclear power plants, the
state of American military technology,
and a little more about the world we are
leaving and the world we are entering.
That has never happened on my previ-
ous trips to Raeford’s and probably will
not happen any other time again.

I guess it left me a little disap-
pointed about the future. As computers
get faster, technology becomes more
and more omnipresent, and everything

becomes quicker,

were just starting on dif-
ferent rivers in the South-
east. lasked him what con-
cerns he had in working
with dangerous and un-

Atwo-hour wait at Raeford’s offers lessons ina
progressing economy.

“Raeford’s way of life”
will probably disappear.

But such is the
price we pay for progress,
which. should continue,

tested technology. Hetold
me that was exactly why
he wanted to have the job — so he could
learn how the “energy of the future”
actually is built and created.

He then went on to discuss his days
in the Air Force and compared his planes
to the new ones.

After I suggested that American
military technology need not be upgraded
given we were so far ahead of everyone
already, he actually did agree with me,
commenting on how the planes he used
in WWII were much more advanced

ment.

Moreover, it answered for me why
Raeford would not expand his opera-
tions by hiring more barbers or at least
try cutting hair faster. For instance, just
when I was there, he lost $50 in busi-
ness for not being faster. He could
easily have taken on another barber for
just a couple bucks an hour or squeezed
more cuts into the day, expanding pro-
ductivity and creating areally high profit
margin — like any good capitalist,

as long as it does provide
more jobs and keeps im-
proving things in some way. (After all,
they do not call it “regress.”’)

- However, withevery gaincomesa
loss, and I hope I related to you what we
might sacrifice for the efficiencies and
economy of the future.

If anything, the attributes of this~
“old” world reminded me of how fun
and interesting just taking life slowly
can be and caused me to rethink the
apparent “‘illogic” behind a 120-minute
haircut.
