D. P.’s Continue Studies
In Spite Of Handicaps

Geneva—Despite lack of assur-
ance of a country to live in or of
the possibility of attaining a pro-
fessional statu.. more than 2000
refugees and displaced persons are
now pursuing their studies in the
universities of Western Germany
and Austria, the U.N. International
Refugee Organization (IRO), an-
nounced here. cs

These students are part of an
estimated 6180 young people of Uni-
versity level among the refugees.
And the fact that only about one-
third enrolled this year for the
fall semester is attributed to lack
of funds to pay tuition, to resettle-
ment programs which are moving
refugees to new countries at the
tate of 1000 per day, and, in some
cases, to the feeling that perhaps
it would be better to study a trade
which more quickly offers a chance
to be accepted for immigration.
Another reason why only one-third
of the students have enrolled is
due to the limitation of foreign

students admitted to German uni-
versities, URO officials say.

. DP students first began attend-
in» German and Austrian univer-
sities in 1945, when the United
Nations Relicf and Rehabilitation
Administration (UNRRA), a pre-
decessor to IRO, arranged for 10
per cent of the quota at univer-
sities to be made available to refu-
gees. Their response was so great
—despite language, financial and
housing difficulties—that usually
there were waiting lines for the
“foreigners quota.”

The DP’s, just as do local stu-
dents, must pay tuition and pro-
vide books and taboratory supplies.
Some help comes *from national
groups whose employed members
contribute to student welfare. Other
have friends abroad who send food
paciages and clothing. Still others
get some part-time work to pay
for their expenses.

Faculty members have found that
DP students as a group attain high-
er marks than their fellows. One
professor — Dr. Walter Waffen-
schmidt, hqnorary professor of eco-
nomics ‘at the University of. Mann-
heim—recently commented that
“compared with German students,
DP and refugee students have been
very industrious and have shown
remarkably good results.’’

Recently, many countries have
offered opportunities for DP stu-
dents to proceed with their studies.
Already, 25 have been granted
scholarships in Canada and apr roxi-
mately 200 have arrived in the
United States under a program
worked out between the World
Student Service Fund and the U. S.
Displaced Persons Commission.
Under the U. S. Displaced Persons
Act, the United States has author-
ized admittance of DP students if
they have scholarships and have
funds to support themselves for one
year. It is anticipated that 200 ref-
ugees will be enrolled at 97 Ameri-
can colleges next spring.

Holland has offered 100 scholar-

ships for students who will settle]

there permanently while Australia,
Denmark, France; New Zealand,
Norway and Sweden. have given
students a chance to pursue their
studies in various ways.

G. Ls’ Job Seniority Claims

Washington, D. C.—The United
States Supreme Court has ruled
that a veteran can sve to enforce
his job senioritv claims under the
GI Bilt of Rights, even though
the year is up for which he was
guaranteed re-employment.

Justice Haroid H. Burton de-
livered the high count’s unanimous
opinion. ‘The case was ordered sent
back to the Sibth Circui. Court of
Appeals, whose judgment was over-
tuled, for further action.

The GI Bill guarantees veterans
re-employment for one year with
the same senority and pay they
would have had if they had not
been in service.

The Supreme Court’s decision
stemmed from two suite filed in
the Federal Court for the Eastern
District of Kentucky.

One of the suits was brought by
John S. Haynes against the South-
ern Railroad. Haynes was, before
his enlistment, a machinist helper
at Somerset, Kentucky. When he
got back he was re-empioyed in the
game capacity. He claimed he
should have been made a helper

apprentice, a higher-paying job, be-
cause workers lower than himself
on the seniority ladder had been
promoted to that position while
he was in service. ;

The other suit was started by
John Walter Oakley, Jr., a locomo-
tive machinist for the L.&N. Rail-
road at Loyall, Kentucky. While
he was off to war, the Loyall shop
was transferred to Corbin, Ken-
tucky. He was re-employed at Cor-
bin with seniority beginning on the
daie he went to work there. He
claimed the seniority should have
begun on the date the shop was
set up in Corbin, since he would
have gone to work at the time if
he had not been in the armed forces.

Both railroads fought the suits.
The Federal Court dismissed the
cases on the ground that more
than a year had elapsed since the
men were restored to their jobs.
The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the judgments. Now the
Supreme Court has overruled the
lower courts and sent the cases

back for further action.

THIS DAY IN TIME...

—are looking to Davidson as a
pace-maker in education in the
Southeast? Davidson, they reason,
has accomplished much, and is ca-
pable of achieving much more;
it is a good example that should

be continued and expanded.

Fortunate is the person who pos-
sesses the wherewithal to support
the development program under
way to strengthen Davidson—to
enlarge its facilities, for, as Dr.
John R. Cunningham, the presi-
dent, points out, contributions
should be considered “as invest-
ments in youth, in Christian homes.
and life, in democracy, and in the
Church and everything for which
it stands.”

Never in the history of America
has there been more urgent need of.
such investments than at this time.
Never has the need been greater
for strengthening the position of
the religious institution of higher
learning as the backbone of the
American system of education.
