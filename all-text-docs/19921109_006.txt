Longtime German Professor,
Julius S.Winkler, Dies

By Kevin Mi

Julius S. Winki PTongtime
German Professor at Dévidéon,
died at the age of 60 in his home on
November 1, 1992.

Bom in Lenoir, North Caro-
lina, he graduated from Lenoir High
School where he received honors
in music and journalism. He at-
tained his bachelor’s degree from
Ohio Wesleyan College, where he
was elected Phi Beta Kappa and
Omicron Delta Kappa.

Upon graduation, he spent a
year in Tuebingen, Germany on a
Fulbright Scholarship, and then he
went on to earn his Ph. D. in Ger-
manic languages and literature
from Princeton University.

After teaching fora time atthe
University of Mississippi and at
Winthrop College, Winkler joined
the faculty of Davidson in 1961.
Throughout his extended career at
Davidson, he served as the chair-
man of the German Department,
he was a member of the Faculty
Executive Committee (as well as
many other committees), and he
twice took Junior Year abroad stu-
dents to Marburg, Germany.

Also, Winkler served as the
faculty advisor and stalwart for the
expired college literary magazine,
The Davidson Miscellany.
i hrough his efforts, this student-
run magazine ran from the mid-
60’s to the mid-80’s, and it re-
ceived subscribers from all over
the nation. The magazine itself
contained literary works from
members of the Davidson commu-
nity as well as authors from else-
where.

Outside ofhis life at Davidson,
Winkler received numerous prizes
for his poetry, short stories and
translations. His works were
printed in many regional publica-

tain Review and Southern Poetry
Review.

His poem “‘Walker” was in-
cluded in the book Poets Pick of
Charlotte (1976), an anthology of
local poetry sponsored by the Char-
lotte Chamber of Commerce and
Queens College. His poem “Hunt”

was included in the book Contem-

porary Poetry of North Carolina
(1977), an anthology of budding
North Carolina writers edited by
Guy Owen and Mary C. Williams.
In this book, Winkler was placed
in a class that included the great
North Carolina writer Randall
Jarell.

His one book, The Ghost in
the Dog Trot, was published in
1975 by the Briarpatch Press (the
same company that published the
two books about Davidson written
by deceased librarian Mary Beaty).
It was through this book of poetry
that his extreme love for the out-
doors and fishing shined.

As all of his friends knew,
Winkler was an excellent fly fish-
erman (so good, in fact, that he
taught beginners), an excellent
golfer (a low handicapper) and an
excellent musician (his achieve-
ments in high school with the bari-
tone and the trombone earned him

the nickname “Gabe”, short for
Gabriel).
On Friday, November 13, at

8:15 in Hodson Hall, Music Pro-
fessor Jennifer Stasack will lead
an ensemble of seventy students
and faculty who will read poems to
music. Included among the poems
are a few of Winkler’s works.

Winkleris survived by his wife
Ellen, his son John and his two
daughters, Laura and Elisabeth.

Terry to tee off from 10 yards out.
But Davidson dominated the bal-
ance of the half offensively, tying
the game at 20:05 when Cliff
Castelloe volleyed in Tommy
Suter’s cross to the right side of the
goal. At 29:30, Castelloe sprinted
down -the-right sideline to steal-a
ball, took it to the corner and
crossed it to Ben Hayes, who
punched it in for a 2-1 lead.

Davidson had a number of
very good chances to put the game
away in the first half, but could not
do it. Rob Ukrop twice hit the
crossbar with headers. “It seemed
like we hit every part of the cross-
bar and the keeper,” he said.

The Mountaineers asserted
themselves a bit more in the sec-
ond half, but Wildcat goalie Alex
Deegan had all the answers. On
one of those answers, late in the
game, Deegan appeared to tackle
an App State player to preventhim
from scoring, and ASU mighthave
been awarded a penalty kick that
could have tied the game. But no
call was made, and Davidson
scored shortly thereafter to make it
3-1.

On that play, Ukrop received ’

the ball on the right side near
midfield, and streaked to his left
and down the middle. Hayes,
onsides and cutting through the
center of the box ahead of Ukrop,
yelled “Put it through”, and after a
pause Ukrop did. Hayes beat the
keeper to earn the two-goal cush-

ion.

~ The whole experience rather
agreed with Ukrop, who was, not
surprisingly, voted Southern Con-
ference player of the year. “That
was fun,” he said after winning the
game and giving Slagle the
celebratory Gatorade shower.
Ukrop was joined on the confer-
ence first team by midfielder Matt
Spear and Omli. Ukrop is consid-
eredastrong candidate fornational
player of the year honors.
Deegan, Castelloe and John
Sampers were named to the All-
SC second team. Slagle was duly
honored as conference coach of
the year. The tournament champi-
onship was his first in 13 seasons
as coach at Davidson.
A recap of the games preced-
ing Sunday’s final follows:
Davidson closed out its regu-
lar season schedule November 1 at
Marshall, in a game made more
difficult by the artificial turf play-
ing surface. The two teams were
tied 1-1 with just 22 minutes re-
maining before the Wildcats ex-
ploded, scoring five goals in just
over 15 minutes to win 6-1.
Castelloe gave the ‘Cats a 1-0
halftime lead with a tailor-made
turf goal, a low, hard, skidding
shot from 25 yards out. The Thun-
dering Herd equalized on a penalty

kick in the 67th minute, apparently
rousing Davidson from its slum-
ber. Sampers made it 2-1 with a
rebound of a shot by Ukrop, and
was credited with the goal'when a
Marshall defender found his own
goal to make it 3-1.

Ukrop scored twice and Andy
Haile once to complete the scor-
ing. Above all else, Slagle was just
happy to be done with turf games.
He called the game “a pretty good
effort by everybody. It’s so foreign
to these guys to play on turf that
I’m always glad when it’s over.”

That win earned the ‘Cats a
return engagement with the Herd
in the opening round of the South-
em Conference Tournament. The
two teams met at 10.a.m. on Friday
inthe very first game of the tourna-
ment, and one of the consequences
of the early start was that the field
was not quite ready for play. As
play began, the groundskeeper was
still painting the sidelines; by the
time he finished, Davidson had
settled the outcome, Goals by
Sampers, Suter and Ukrop in the
first nine minutes decided things,
and four goals by Haile topped off
a 9-1 win. Spear and Hayes also
scored.

Haile, known affectionately to
his teammates as “Meat”, notched
his four goals in a span of roughly
30 minutes in the second half, twice
dribbling past the goalkeeper to
score on an open net. “Meat” re
vealed after the game that the mo-
tivation for his outburst was less
than conventional; “[trainer] Scott
Applegate was yelling at me,” he
said, “and I had to shut him up.”

In the second round Saturday
afternoon, the Wildcats meta VMI
team which it had beaten 7-1 in the
regular season, and Slagle was as
concerned, as much as anything
else, about keeping his regulars
restedand injury-free. A frustrated
group of Keydets, in the process of
being thrashed in their final game
of the year, played quite physically
in the second half, but Davidson
remained injury-free and won the
game 5-0on the strength ofa Ukrop
hat trick.

Ukrop scored on apenalty kick
6:14 into the game and on a re-
bound shot, assisted by Hayes and
Phelps Sprinkle, 14:15 in to make
it 2-0 at half. He was given credit
for a goal scored by a VMI de-
fender with 28 minutes to play.
The goal was Ukrop’s 30th of the
season (a Davidson record), 75th
of his career (a Davidson record),
and boosted his nation-leading
point total to 69 points.

In the 68th minute, Hayes re-
ceived the ball at the top left corner
of the box, dribbled cleverly past
the goalie, and tucked the ball in-
side the near post witha left-footed
shot to make it 4-0. The ‘Cats got
their last one on a beautifully-ex-
ecuted corner kick play, with Omli
heading in across to the far post by
Sampers.

death, Throop’s discussion frequently referred back to one point. Tol-
erance. Even the anti-realist understands that, “one man’s values are just
as good as anothers, although one who is success oriented has more to

offer than a couch potato.”
