Two Students Robbed

at Gunpoint in Charlotte
Gunman Kills S.C. Sherrif's Deputy

By Tom Koonce

Friday, September 25 at 8:20
pm two Davidson students were
robbed at gunpoint at’ the
Bellissimo Ristorante, formerly
Hemingways, on Monroe Road in
Charlotte. The students were con-
fronted by two males as they left
their car to enter the’ restaurant.
The two men took their wallets.and
the car.

The two Charlotte suspects,
Dwayne Eric Forney and Mareece
Aldean Hughes, were later pulled
over on Dave Lyle Boulevard near
I-77 in Rock Hill, SC at around
10:40 pm during a routine traffic
stop. One of the men is believed to
have shot deputy James Brent
McCants three times - in the head,
back and side. McCants, a23-year

old York County sheriff’s deputy,
was taken to Piedmont Medical
Center at 11pm and pronounced
dead before midnight.

Thecar was recovered in front
of a Holiday Inn at 10:50 pm and
Forney, armed with the handgun,
was apprehended at 11:47 pm. The
other suspect, Hughes, was found
at 2am Saturday in a wooded area
behind the Holiday Inn.

The two Davidson students,
who wish to remain anonymous,
talked to the Davidsonian about
this incident. They said that they
had travelled into Charlotte to eat
dinner on Friday evening. After
leaving the Cajun Queen where
the wait was too long, they picked
the Bellissimo Ristorante.

They pulled into the parking-

lot on the side of the restaurant
which was angled so the parking
places could be seen easily from
Monroe Road. The front parking
space was open, so they pulled into
what they described asa very well-
lit parking-lot and a space which
seemed to be relatively safe. They
stated that they were actually very
close to the front door of the res-
taurant.

The two students said that they
stopped the car and then stayed in
the automobile, gathering their
things together before leaving to
enter the restaurant. The male stu-
dent, who was driving a gray four-
door Buick Century, got out first.
As the female student was getting

"Bonus Bucks" Faces Criticism

Pritchard Defends New Meal Plan System

By Tom Koonce

The Dining Service hasimple-
mented a new system of purchas-
ing meals for this year which in-
volves ‘bonus’ money added to a
student’s declining balance, while
also taking away the ability for
Students to deduct meals on their
meal plan for lunch or dinner. The
program, entitled ““Bonus Bucks,”
has received some criticism from
students who feel that this new
program has created’ rather than
solved problems.

‘ Carleton Pritchard, Director
of Auxiliary Services, said that he
started Bonus Bucks to give stu-
dents an opportunity to eat at any

time at either the Commons, ‘the
Union, the Outpost or Baker Un-
derground, on their meal plan. He
said, “Our major idea in develop-
ing Bonus Bucks was to allow stu-
dents greater flexibility.”

According to Pritchard,
Davidson College has been on a
three-meal plan system since 1987-
1988. After the third plan was
introduced, ten meals a week as
well as the 19 and 14 meal plans,
the following year students were
allowed to eat breakfast and lunch,
in the Union Cafe to allow for
greater flexibility.

Pritchard said that when the
grocery opened in the Cafe, it had

a direct impact on how the meal
plan system operated. Last year
students were allowed to spend up
to $3.60 on lunch and breakfast in
the Cafe, regardless of whether the
money was spent on groceries or
actual meals. .

After last year, Pritchard said
that a new program was needed
because students were spending
more money on groceries in the
Union than they were spending on
actual meals.

When asked how he deter-
mined the difference in money
spent on groceries and money spent

Union Outpost Vs. Cafe: College
Examines Student Dining Options

By Tom Koonce

The new eating alternative on
Patterson Court, the
Union Outpost, has
now been open for
two and a half
weeks. The grill in
the Outpost is run
by Auxiliary Ser-
vices and activities
and meetings in the
building are sched-
uled and run by the
Union.

The Outpost
grill is open from
~lipm-3am° on
Wednesdays and
Thursdays and from 8pm-3am on
Fridays and Saturdays. According
to Director of Auxiliary Services
Carleton Pritchard, the reasons for
these hours are that the Dean of

Students felt like these were the
hours most in demand by the stu-

dents for such a facility.

When the Outpost grillisopen
the Union Cafe is closed. There-
fore, the Cafe closes at 11pm on
Wednesdays and Thursdays’ and

the grill there closes one hour be-
fore this time. Pritchard said that
hehas “personally
not heard any
complaints” about
the _ restricted
hours in the Cafe
and the hours in
the new Outpost.

Pritchard said that
he thought over a
lot of alternatives
about how to run
the Union Out-
post. He admitted
that there will
probably be
changes, “Anything is possible, we
need to give it two or three weeks
to see how it works out.” He said
