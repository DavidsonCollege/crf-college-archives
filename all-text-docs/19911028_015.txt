FEED THE
DEFENSIVE LINE

By Bruce Balestier

Sophomore guard Pat Hol-
loway and freshman forward
George Spain each scored 18 points
Saturday afternoon, in leading the
Red team to a 64-54 victory over
the Black squad in Davidson’s
annual Red-Black scrimmage.
Junior center Detlef Musch scored
14 to pace the Black.

Holloway teamed. primarily
with sophomore Jason Zimmer-
man in the Red''backcourt; and

scored with about equal regularity
off penetration to the basket and
long jumpers. The 6’8" Spain, from
Columbia, S.C., did the majority
of his damage in one-on-one battle
with the 7’0" Musch, and shot a
sparkling 8-11 from the field. With
the departure of James Marsh to
play professional ball in Germany,
, Spain’s contributions at the big
forward spot could be integral to
the success of this year’s team.
Sophomore Scott Alford, who

missed most of last season with a
knee injury, shot the ball well (5-9)
in contributing 13 points for the
Red team, while sophomore Janko
Narat had 9 and freshman walk-on
candidate Linton Elliott 8 (includ-
ing 2 three-pointers) for the Black.

The Wildcats’ first exhibition
contest is November 9 at Cherry
Point. Their first regular-season
game is November 23 against
Alabama at Belk Arena.
