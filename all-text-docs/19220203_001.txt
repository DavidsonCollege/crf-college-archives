Although no definite arrangements
have been made, it is a certainty that the

champions.

Davidson with a set of sterling young

The motto which the club has had for
several years was, “A bigger and better

students and by the first of July last
year far more than that number had ap-
plied for registration. This year a new
motto has been chosen: “soo again—
