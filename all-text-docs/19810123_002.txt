News at a Glance

Students will be able to study next term under one of the
nation’s foremost social and political philosophers.

Dr. Carl Cohen of the University of Michigan will teach two
courses, Communism, Fascism, and Democracy and a seminar
on public policy.

Cohen has been at Davidson twice before, as a Reynolds
lecturer in 1978 and in a debate with Oxford’s Ronald Dworkin
about the Bakke affirmative action case.

“He's a very intense man and a fantastic public speaker,”
Philosophy Professor Lance Stell said, ‘‘as well as being always
accessible to studen

Stell pointed out that the ceiling of Cohen’s Communism
course is 175, so “anyone who wants to should be able to get in.”’

Cohen’s specialties are social and political‘philosophy, ethics,
and public policy. He has been a member of the National Board
and Chairman of the Michigan chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union and a consultant to the Senate Sub-Committee
on the Constitution.

Cohen’s publications include Communism, Fascism, and
Democracy: The theoretical. Foundations, Civil Disobedience:
Conscience, Tactics and the Law, and Democracy, as well as
innumerable articles. He has written extensively on Supreme
Court decisions.

Israel, Florida, California, and Peru.

The faculty adjourned their special meeting Tuesday without
voting on the Educational Policy Committee’s revised proposals
for a new core curriculum. Discussion centered around a number
of recommended amendments to the proposals.

Consideration of the proposals will continue at another special
meeting, probably next week.

Davidson has received a $345,000 special grant for the
1981-82 fiscal year from the Duke Endowment.

The grant will support the humanities, the new computer
center, road improvements, the library, women’s athletics, and
the Lake Campus.

The major portion of the grant will go to support the
humanities, which include literature, languages, hiatory,
and philosophy. These departments will receive $190,000 for
salary increases, $50,000 in endowment funds, and $15,000 to
match grants obtained by faculty members.

The computer center will get $50,000.

The grant will also help the College buy microfilm editions of
journals and build a boat storage facility at the Lake Campus.

The current grant represents only a portion of the Duke
Endowment’s support of Davidson, which last year exceeded
$1,000,000.

Washing machines and dryers are now available free of charge

for student use, according to Business Manager Robert Currie.
Until recently, only coin operated machines were available.
' The change follows a series of complaints lodged against the
laundry service last October. Several students, citing instances
of lost clothing, missing buttons and staining requested that
machines be made available without cost for those wanting to do
their. own laundry.

“The reason the machines were coin operated in the past was
to keep outsiders from abusing them,” Currie said. There has
been no abuse reported since the machines were changed, he
added.

Currie also said that the laundry is attempting to upgrade
quality control by inspecting outgoing laundry more closely.

Two segs of machines are located in the basement of Watss
dormitory and two sets in the laundry building itself.

Students who are recipients of North Carolina Guaranteed
loans should-endorse their checks at the Comptroller's Office as
soon as possible.

In addition to Michigan, Cohen has taught in New Zealand,

Solar greenhouse workshop a success

By FRANCES PALMER
Staff Writer

The solar greenhouse at the
depot is almost complete.

The Y-Service Corps sponsor-
ed a three day workshop last
weekend to construct the green-
house.

According to former Y Presi-
dent Minor Sinclair, nearly 20
people showed up for the work-
shop daily. Although most
workers were Davidson stud-
ents, ther was some help from
the community. One man from
the depot, Roosevelt Wilson,
worked on the greenhouse each
day.

Some construction is still
incomplete. Y Greenhouse
chairman Albert Connette said
they need to frame in the east
wall and then finish several

minor things. .

Reading Day Eliminated

Once completed, the green-
house will provide heat for the
Davidson Senior Citizens’ cent-
er at the depot. Located on the
south side of the building, the
12 feet by 22 feet greenhouse wil
operate as a ‘‘passive solar
design.’’ Several 55 gallon
drums filled with water will
absorb heat during the day to
heat the air inside the green-
house. This air rises and is
passed into the depot.

Connette hopes that the
greenhouse will be producing
enough heat by the end of this
weekend to heat the depot.

Connette is pleased with the
progress thus far. ‘‘It’s coming
along,” he said. He added that
it is “nice to see it’”’ now that the
greenhouse has gone from ‘‘the
paper stage to being there.”’

Sinclair said there were ‘‘no
major mistakes,’’ and he too is

Trial calendar change: Good

By SCOT MYERS
Staff Correspondent

There will be no classes on
Good Friday (April 9) this year.

Last fall term, SGA Presi-
dent David Waddill submitted a
proposal for a one-day Good
Friday holiday to the Executive
Committee of the faculty. The

‘committee approved the propo-

sal December 31.

Because of the holiday, clas-
ses will extend through Friday,
May 14. This was a reading day
in the original calendar.

Spring term exams will be
given on Saturday, Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday, May

15, 17, 18, and 19. Although
there will be no reading day,
students may use Saturday as a
reading day and still have three
exam days. The spring term
exam period will be the same
length as the fall and winter
term exam periods.

The Good Friday holiday was
proposed two years ago, but
was turned down by the com-
mittee, Waddill said. He added
that he decided to petition the
committee again because stud-
ents still felt the spring term
was too long without an inter-
ruption.

Waddill said the committee
considered several different pro-

pleased with the results. He did
say, though, that “it was
probably a little more expensive
than I had hoped.’’ This is
because wood had to be bought
to replace some that had rotted.

Wilson, who moved to David-
son in 1931, worked on the
construction for three or four
hours. He became interested in
the greenhouse project because
of the ad the Y placed in the
paper to help or just come by to
watch. “I figured I was suppos-
ed to help,”’ he said.

According to Wilson, others
at the depot like the idea of the
greenhouse. ‘‘Everybody’s well
pleased,” he said.

Wilson plans to use the
greenhouse in April. He would
like to have tomato plants,
cucumbers, and _ possibly
squash. He said, ‘I think -it’s
going to be wonderful.”

Friday holiday

posals, and he could sit in on
their discussions. But when the
committee voted he was not
allowed to attend.

Academic Vice-President
Price Zimmermann said the
holiday was approved this year
only ‘‘as a trial.’”” But Waddill
said he is certain that the
holiday will remain in the
calendar in the future because of
the strong student support will
continue to receive.

‘“‘Davidson is a religious
school,’”’ Waddill pointed out,
and should recognize Good Fri-
day as a holiday.

Commencement will be on
May 23 as planned.
