Y To Spo
or Entering Freshmen

By ZACH SMITH
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The Freshman Camp _ Pro-
gram received its final ap-
proval from the college admin-
istration and the YMCA Board
of Directors early this week.
The camp will be a gathering
of a portion of the freshmen
class in a nearby church camp
for two days prior to orienta-
tion next fall.

The formation of the camp
program resulted from a study
under the leadership of Charles
Ringe. The camp will be oper-
ated as a program of the Y, in
cooperation with the Dean of
Students and other members of
the administration, by a Stu-
dent. Steering Committee ap-
pointed by the Y cabinet.

For the first year at least,
the camp will be limited to
seventy-five freshmen, who

*

will be selected according to
the order of returned appli-
cations.

Ringe listed the two basic
purposes of the camp as “to
discover and help meet the
needs of the individual as he
enters college and to aid the
student as he confronts certain
basic issues in society and as
he seeks meaning in life.”

This will be accomplished
by addresses by faculty mem-
bers and in various discus-
sion groups under the pro-

posed theme: “Either/Or vs.

Both/And, Choices Among

Values.” Other than the

theme the program has not

been completed.

The camp will be run by stu-
dents who will be under the
direction of a faculty advisor
who will live at the camp. The
director will probably. be select-

nso

rCa

ed next week by the Y Cabinet
after consultation with the
Dean of Students. There will
also be a student director, two
assistants, a business manager
and fifteen counselors.

The counselors will be ap-
pointed in February by the
Student Steering Committee.
There will be one counselor
for every five freshmen at
the camp. A minimum of five
forty-five minute sessions,
one of which will be at the |
camp site, will be required
of all counselors.

At present, two sites are be-|
ing considered for : the camp: !
Camp Stewart, on the other eg |
of Charlotte, and Camp Grier,
near Asheville.
dates of the camp are Septem-

ber 6-8 and the cost is estimat- |

ed at being from ten to fifteen
dollars per freshmen, depend-

Shearer Funeral Rites:
Dr. Davidson Presides

But then, this was a different
sort of funeral—one full of fun,
jokes, and laughter. This day
marked the death of that re-
markable structure (some hesi-
tate to call it a building) long
noted as the campus eye-sore.
Yes, the old “Glory to God and
Lizzy Hall” had reached the
end of its days.

At 10:15 Wednesday morning
the ROTC band blurted forth
with military music, trying
mig’stily to drown out the op-
posing sounds issuing from the
church steeple. A stream of
students began to converge on
Shearer Hall, which was at
tracting students to a chapel
for the first time in many years.
Some students even detoured
from their regular P.O. trek.

DAVIDSON PRESIDES

The crowd assembled in the
upstairs auditorium.  Officiat-
ing at this service was the very

' Reverend Chalmeds Davidson.
Raising his hand for silence,
Dr. Davidson began. “I never
thought that 35 years ago when
I was here as a student I would

this noble ediface.

“At that time the faculty
was required to attend chapel.
(Applause.) I had a couple of
stories to tell about some of
these men, but I didn’t know
we were going to have a mixed
audience.”

Dr. Davidson then proceeded
to relate some of the pictures-
que history of fhis building. It
was built in 1838, one year
after Oak and Elm Row. It
began its career as a church, “a
very fine one,” Chalmers add-
ed. It was believed that the
rain draining off the eastern
slope of the room eventually
reached the Yadkin River. The
western slope drained into the
Catawba.

In this building were held all
religious services for many
years. When old Chambers was
built, many thought that chapel
would be transferred to the
grand Chambers Commence-
ment Hall. However, there was
one flaw. No heating. Thus,
Shearer retained some of its

winter chapel quarters.

BUILDING REMODELED

During Dr. Shearer's reign,
he decided to name a building
after his wife. He chose the old
chapel and proceeded to re-
model* (Chalmers would say
ruin) the building. At that time
the building assumed its pres-
ent name and shape.

When old Chambers burned,
Shearer became the academic
center of the campus. Dr.
Davidson commented that the
windows of the building were
very functional. They were very
low and allowed students to
crawl out when the professor
wasn’t looking.

SPEECH CONCLUSION

Dr. Davidson then reached
the close of his speech. “Prob-
ably there isn’t much that ever
happened at Davidson . that
didn’t happen at one time or
another im this old building. It
is steeped in the triumphs and
tragedies of the students, their
festive celebrations and their

dure.

There is a_ possibility
that Joni James will not ap-
pear for a concert for Mid-
Winters dance weekend.

IFC president Ward McKei-
then revealed that. he learned
of this last Saturday when he

{received a letter from the agent

in New York who had arranged

jfor Joni to appear here.

The letter states that she is

in London at this time, and
she doubts that she will be
back in time to appear at

Davidson for her Friday, Feb-
ruary 12, concert.

The IFC has wired the agent
jthat it intends to hold Miss
James to her contract, and the
agent is supposed to let the
IFC know definitely by Friday,
January 15th, whether or not
she will appear.

There is a possibility that she
may choose to break the con-
tract, but this could involve
legal action against her if the
IFC chose to do so. In the mean-
time, McKeithen said, “We are
proceeding as planned and as-
suming that she'll be here.”

If Joni James doesn’t appear,
the IFC intends to do every-
thing possible to secure another
outstanding attraction for the
Friday night concert.

Each Class Gets
Free Vespers Cut

The College Executive Com-
mittee approved the recommen-
dation of the Religious Life
Committee this week to exempt
each class from one vesper ser-
vice the first month of the sec-
ond semester. This move is to
eliminate the expected  over-
crowded conditions.

According to the accepted
schedule, classes will be
exempt on the following sched-
ule: February 7, freshmen; Feb-
ruary 14. sophomores; February

21, juniors; February 28, sen-
iors, This program will be in
effect only for the first four
Sundays.

Symposium Mer Harvard Business School.

Scheduled For March 6-11

YMCA for a Symposium on

Through this symposium, the
Y hopes to bring to the stu-
dents an altogether fresh con-
cept of vocations as the call to
each individual to live and
work for the highest values he
holds.

In an interview this week,
Bill Martin, Y representative in
charge of this program, em-
phasized the fact that this pro-
gram is an outgrowth of the
fact that many Davidson boys
are going into life with the idea
of “making a good living” for
themselves.

“For these people,” Martin
stated, “it is not always easy
to make their: chosen voca-
tions serve the highest valves
which they possess. This is
especially true for those who
profess Christian values.”

The program will begin on
Sunday, March 6, with Dr. Carl
Michalson of Drew University as
the vespers speaker. On Tues-
day, C. J. Wilcox, national per-
sonnel manager for the J. C.
Penney and Company, will view

Martin said that the sympo-
sium grew out of a point stress-
ed by Dr. George Buttrick in
last year’s Religious Emphasis
Week services that a Christian
should serve God in ali that he
does.

Graduating Armfield
Directs Final Issue

Dick Smith will succeed to the Editorship of the
DAVIDSONIAN when present Editor Ed Armfield grad-
uates at the end of this semester. Smith, currently Assis-

tant Editor, was runner-up
last Spring

Tom Colvin will become Fea-
ture Editor and Gene Wells,
photographer, Smith announc-
ed. Other new appointments to
the staff will be made later.

Armfield will graduate ‘to
work for his father at Reyn-
olds and Company, a stock
brokerage house. “Of course,
graduation is not a spur of
the moment decision,” Arm-
field pointed out. “The Edi-
torship of the DAVIDSONIAN
was the main consideration
making me hesitant to grad-
vate a semester earlier than
| had planned. After much

decision in the long run.”

have enjoyed the close asso-

to whom I owe so much appre-

“It seems entirely logical
that Dick should become edi-
tor. I have no reservations as to
his ability to run the news-
paper. He will do a fine job.”

Outlining DAVIDSONIAN
policies and activities for
second semester, Smith point-
ed to a continwing investiga-
tion of the cut system. The
paper is submitting a propo-
sal to the faculty committee
as requested, and will con-
tinue to work closely with it
on the issue. The possibility
of instituting « system of
comprehensive examinations
at Davidson will be explored
on the editorial pages in the
near future.

Further consideration will be
given to the segregation issue.

A poll of student opinion will
be taken and the DAVIDSON-
IAN hopes to submit this to the
Board of Trustees at the
same time the faculty presents
its opinion. A more extensive
statement of policy will appear
in the next issue.

“The mid-semester change of
editorship is, 1 believe, with-
out precedent,” Smith noted.
“Ed has been well liked and
everyone hates to see him go.
I only hope that the job we do
will equal his.”

Students Register

Registration for second sem-
ester began this week for
sophomores, juniors, and
