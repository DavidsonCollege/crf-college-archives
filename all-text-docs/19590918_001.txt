The group of seventy David-
son cadets attending the camp
were led in achieving this hon-
or by: Bob Croom of Maxton,
who was selected as the “Best
Cadet” of the 1443 who attend-
ed the six week camp. This

is also the second straight year
thet the “Best Cadet” designa-
tion has gone to a Davidson
student.

The “Best College” award
was made on the basis of com-
paring individual cadet grades
and the averages of the twenty-
seven schools. Special emphasis
was placed on individual ac-
complishments, with the re-
mainder of the grade coming
from written and practical
examinations.

One important factor was
the number of cadets win-
ning the daily “Colonel's
Orderly” competition. One
cadet is chosen each night
from the thirty-six forming
the camp interior guard. He

is designated “Colonel's

winners, had more than any
