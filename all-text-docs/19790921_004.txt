Needed: Minimum Sanction

Dean Terry’s original proposed addition to the Code of
disciplinary procedure stated that “Any student found
guilty of an Honor Code Violation will ordinarily be
suspended for a minimum of one year, excluding the
freshman year.” A minimum sanction is needed for cases
of cheating, stealing, or lying under oath. But an
automatic one year suspension seems severe. Terry is
willing to negotiate the length; everyone should
appreciate the need for such a sanction.

Terry has stated that regardless of how long the
minimum sanction is, he and the Honor Committee need
to agree upon one. Currently any student who is charged
with an Honor Code violation can choose whether to let
the Dean of Students or the Honor Council handle the
case. Once a judiciary body has accepted a case, it is
asked to do two things: 1) to investigate the facts and
‘aetermine guilt or innocence 2) it guilt is proved, impose
’ @ sanction. The Terry Proposal affects only the latter.

After the taxing ordeal of “weighing all evidence” to see
if “the proof of -violation is clear and convincing” the
determination of a just sanction is sometimes impaired
by compassion for the student involved by the members
of the Council or the Dean. Determination of sanction is
often an emotionally exhausting decision and is made
even more demanding when a defendant plays on the
human element. Pressure to succeed and please loved
ones are used by some defendants, but these pleas
shouldn't be allowed to unjustly interfere with the proper
administration of the Honor Code.

During my three years on the-Honor Council | have seen
how compassion can compromise the effectiveness of
both the Honor Council and‘the Dean of Students. We are
human. Our judgements are not always consistent. We
need a guideline, a standard to work from. A minimum
sentence would help us to do our job better.

-A minimum sanction would not take away from the
flexibility of the procedure. Cases with extenuating
circumstances will still be accomodated. Anyone
dissatisfied with the decision by either the Dean or the
Honor Council can appeal their case to the Review Board.

in the past, minimum sanctions have been rather
vague. This has sometimes resulted in inconsistent
sentences. A minimum sentence of at least two terms
must be agreed upon by both the Dean of Students and
the Honor Council. Then, after several months of using
this verbal guideline, an appropriate minimum sentence
should be incorporated into. the Code of Disciplinary
Procedure. It’s only fair.

To the Editor:

, Your editorial of September
14 concerning the Review Board
decision to postpone a student’s
suspension from Fall ’79 until
the winter term closed with the
statement, ‘‘Under these cir-
cumstances a full report from
the Review Board appears not
only justified but imperative.”
Unfortunately the Review
board cannot make public state-
ments about any of the appeals
which it reviews without the
written consent of the student
involved. In the particular case,
that written consent does not
appear to be forthcoming and
therfore, in regard to the parti-

culars of this case, we are left -

only with rumor and conjecture..

“It is for this reason I suggest
that our major concerns are the
effects of this decision on stu-
dent and faculty morale and the
possibility that the college com-
munity will view it as a prece-
dent for future sanction

The Honor Code is probably
the most important aspect of
life at Davidson, and certainly
one in which students take
great pride. The faculty and
student body entrust the execu-
tion of the Honor System to a
select’ group of its members
which they elect.. Unfortun-
ately, the dissatisfaction of
students and faculty alike as
evidenced by their. widespread
discussion of this case, demon-
strates that their confidence in
thé Review Board is not as
strong as it should be. We
definitely have a proniem of
morale. .

We must also be antecaed
with the possibility that the
decision as. a precedent for
future sanctions. The student
involved, as pointed out in last
week’s editorial, is a prominent
athlete and therefore many
people view the decision as
evidence that preferential treat-.
ment is going to be given to

athletes at the expense of the me
Honor Code. Ae anne eee

and never will be the case.
Davidson is an institution
‘dedicated to academics, and
athletics, although very impor-
tant, must come second. In this
light, a student who appeals his
suspension from the college on
the grounds that a course he
wants to take is offered only in
the term in question, would be
more justified than a student
who wants to return to partici-
pate in his sport. However,
neither of these situations pro-
vides a legitimate grounds for,
appeal. Davidson Colege has an

Honor Code which all students -

agree to live by before they
come here, and any who do not
live by that code will be
suspended from the college.
This brings us to the other
question of precedent. Can a
student’s suspension from the
college be postponed? The ans-
wer is no and here the Review
Board committed a serious er-
ror. It has always been the
understanding of the Dean of
Students and the Honor Council
that a sanction of suspension is
effective immediately and that
multiple terms of suspension
will be served consecutively. To
avoid any future confusion over
this point which heretofore was

‘considered so mundane as not.

to require codification, there is a
proposal before the Student
Conduct Council to this in
writing to the Code of Disciplin-
ary Procedure. It is true that
the Review Board has the power
to reduce any sanction to one
which they deem more appro-
priate. Unfortunately, they did
not reduce‘the sanction but
instead sought to reduce the
severity of the sanction.

In conclusion, it is obvious

that the Review Board decision,
for whatever, reason it was

made, cannot be justified. How- '

ever, the decision has been
made, and there is no reason for

anyone to expect it to be

reversed at this point. We all
commit errors in judgment, and
it is through such errors that we
grow and our institutions are
strengthened. - Whatever deci-

sion the Review Board made, I —

am sure was made with the best

intedwat of the college commun-
nity in mind. We must not let
our disapproval of this one
decision undermine our confi-
dence in the Review Board or
the Honor System as a whole.

The Answer

To the Editor:

I should like to announce the
answer to the puzzle seen
around Davidson during the
past two weeks:

American flag, capital Ww,
brand-name basketball
jshoes = Alenda lux ubi orta
‘libertas.

Correct answers did not nece-
“sarily have to be in Classical
Latin; all Indo-European lan-
guages were acceptable.

Thank you. —
