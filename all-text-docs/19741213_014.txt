Gozinyas, Tribe Named B- Ball Top

By C.A. and Y.B.

Helio there, fellow denyers
of unreality, it’s Got tone
‘again. ABC¥and@ tne NGAA

“ are proud to introduce another
exciting year of IMAC basket-
_ball, the world’s finest sport! <~

We welcome you to another
year of fights, arguments, no
conscience shooting and ab-
solutely zero defense. But fir-
st, we’d like to congratulate
the SAE’s on their second con-
secutive IMAC flickerball
title. They beat the KA’s 33-20
and if Peyton Prospere comes
back for a sixth year they
ought to do something about
his excess eligibility.

We’ve got so much info
we're going to start into it
right away without the usual
six paragraphs of in-
troductory bullshit.

The Kerwood Derbies seem
lke they’ve finally got it
together after two years of
frustration. The added depth
of Tex Collins and Rick
McKenzie should put them
among the fropt winfiers.
Veteran Brad Sebastian

“Richardson 4

scored 13 to pace a well-
balanced Derby attack to a 47-
31 victory over PAX, despite
the Human Beachball’s 12
trash points.

In an unbelievable game,
thouse A
defeated Cannon III $1-12. Can
you believe that nonsense, a
freshman team defeating
‘another freshman team by §9
points? Cannon III ought to
shoot their IMAC represen-
tative for not knowing the dif-
ference between A and B.

After they do that, they
ought to consider shooting
themselves, do us all a favor.
Sixty-nine points! Seems Can-
non ITI breeds turkeys, though
it'll be hard to be as spastic as
iast year’s Cannon III’s.
Anyhow keep up the good
work, and don’t trip on the
way to the library.

A squad by: the rather
peculiar name of Beetle Leg
looked tough defeating the
KA’s 62-46. Beetle Leg is
what’s left of the Little Big
Men plus Randy Wags and Pat
Flannigan, the Goon who took

his big salary to a contender
for the crown--instead of
scoring 50 a game for the AT
Zeroes.

Delt: II defeated ETC. 85-43
despite the zero points by
ETC.’s Mike Pappas. The
Delts look fairly powerful with
the down and-out duo of Puma
Pomeroy and Space King Tim
Barr scoring 48.

Ah yes, the Tribe appears
again. The lackadaisical yet
apathetie Cleveland Indians
nipped a surprisingly strong
Richardson I Starfukker team
(Hello, Steve Canterbury) 62-
52.

The Tribe with a host of
talent and a lot of other things
look to be co-favorites for the
throne with the Gozinya’s.
Picture yourself in a boat on a
river.

Delt III couldn’t keep up
with the remains of Hoboken
Shark as they were tubbed 54-
17. The remains, calling them-
selves Old Rooney, probably

If you’re thinking that, by
_the title, this is a take-off on
Jimmy the Greek’s column,
exactly

has been whipping ‘‘the

Greek” on all of the spreads
this year on both college and
pro football games. (If you
don’t believe me, just ask
around.)

I know a lot of you don’t
even know what a spread is,
but I will offer one definition—
the amoung of points given to
the underdog to make the
game even, in my opinion. In
the coming weeks, I will offer
not only spreads but odds on
basketball, football, hockey,
racing (primarily for Slagle)
and other sports.

Now that I have established
my reputation and told you my
set-up, this introductory ar-

ticle will be devoted solely to.

the upcoming college bowl
games. (These are subject to
change because of injuries.)

Sun Bowl—I’d just as soon
see Grand Canyon U. play
Mesa County Community
College, but we’re stuck with
North Carolina against
Mississippi State. N.C. must
get the “Porous Award” for
giving up 42 points to Army!
Even though Kupec passes for
about 60-65 percent, I make it

State by four points, as they. three

are coming off of a rougher

‘this one the “Fiasto Bowl.’
Oklahoma State has had a
very inconsistent year, recen-

on seeing American U. ‘aska--Nebraska has been

selection committee decided
against it. Tennessee was

Sugar Bowl—Florida-Nebr-

rival Oklahoma all season, but
they still have a better team

chosen because they were the ‘ than Florida, whois up and

only team left and they play in
the SEC, and also they were
the only team brave enough to
go up against Randy White.
This should not be close.
Maryland by 11. -
_ Peach Bowl-—Vanderbilt-
Texas, Tech.—Frankly, I label
this one as a WC bow! (Who
Cares), but I’ll give this game
a couple of lines anyway. Van-
derbilt is in the same condition
as Tennessee and Tech was
blown out of that hotly-
contested SWC race. Since I
don’t care, I’ll make it even
and let you pick this one.
Tangerine Bowl—Georgia-
Miami of Ohio—If Miami is as
good as the pollsters say, why
are they (9-0-1) playing a team

only two real tough games all

limb for an upset . Georgia by

Gates Bowl—Texas-Aubur-
n- , very good football
teams have been pushed into
this somewhat minor bowl by
Baylor and .Alabama. This
game, nowever, will be as
good, if not better than most of
the four major games. It

Auburn defense. It is hard to
tell how Texas feels about not.

but F will thréw if some.
bias and pick Vexas by .
over Shug’s group (I
don’t think “the Greek” will
like my pick on this one.)

Bluebonnet Bowl——Housto-
n-N.C. State—-A classic mat-
chup of offense vs. offense.
Earlier in the season , I would
have picked Houston by a bun-
die. Houston, however, just
lost to a suspect Tulsa team by,
16 points (sorry, Jay) and N:C..
State has been beating respec-

: down. Nebraska by 2.

Rose Bowl----Ohio State-
Southern  California--This
compares to the Bluebonnet
Bowl in that a couple of-weeks
ago, I would have picked Ohio
State in a romp. But things
have changed. State can’t get

into’ end zone, but A.D. can. 5 y:

it’s U.S.C. By 5.
Orange Be oa aaa |

Notre Dame-It’s too bad this | ‘
year’s game won't be as good §

as last year’s. The Tide wants
revenge and will get it.
With ‘‘Bear’’ playing 60
players, Alabama by 17.
Cotton Bowl-—Baylor-Penn
State—Is this the Baylor that
was getting beat by Texas by
50 points a couple of years
ago? Yes, and the are “sky
high.” But that won’t help
them against a_ bowl-

experienced Penn State team. §

Penn State by 8.

I would like to conclude this
bowl preview by giving
‘Screw Job’’ Awards to
Michigan, Oklahoma and
Texas A&M for not appearing
in a bowl. Also, I know many
fans are interested in small
colleges so I pick Delaware by
7 over Central Michigan for
the college division cham-
pionship.

center Tom (Reverend Big)
112. Anyone want to draw a
charge? (for added effect say

Meanwhile Delt I (note for
frosh: there are at least two
200,000 Delt teams, you’ll
never be able to tell the dif-
ference, and if you beat them
they’ll serve you for breakfast
the next day) destroyed SAE II
72-39 behind a balanced at-
tack.

In a big upset, I Felta Thi
beat Faculty A 43-42. Faculty
A, missing the services of Rah
Rah Friars and not helped at
all by the once in a blue moon
appearance of Chip Stone
(who really wasn’t there
anyhow), couldn’t cope with
Larry Urban’s six last half
goals.

Coach Kirby Combe had this
to say about the win, ‘“‘we wan-
ted this one, it wouldn’t have
mattered if Coach Larranaga
had showed up.”’

In Monday’s games, fresh-
man upstarts the Possums
nipped the Delphi Bureau 54-
53. The Delphi Bureau, pretty
much the old Ghetto, was
missing the services of center
Charles Bethea and should be

-@ prime contender. upon his

return. The Possums were
led by Mike (the: Polish
Rifle) Peshosky’s 24.

(SAE I, featuring who else
but the Ancient Mariner him-
self, Peyton Prospere, used
tight D and strong boards to
whip Delt IV 58-2. There are
possibly more Delt teams then

Pharaoh’s of the 112th dynasty
(quick, check your” Geach’
notes, library rats) and Delt
IVis nothing special.

The SAE’s are a contender
however, look for them to
be in the title picture—title pic-
ture comes on Channel 36 after
Late Afternoon Matinee.

In a great IMAC game, Six-
Pack defeated Cannon II 39-32.
The Six-Pack used a box zone
and sent Bob (I only go right)
Lauder’s deep. Saunders got
two points, a 15 footer (not
bad for a guy wearing a sling)
and Tom Fleischer scored 17
to lead the Foamy’s.

The SPE’s applied a too
tight jock to the Gnads and
cupped them 48-36. The SPE’s
fortunes don’t look as bright
as they once did, due to the
loss of Ed Yeaton to the
basketball program.

The Sig Eps did recruit Air
Ball Horton, rather dubiously
we might add, and will make
up for their deficiencies with
enthusiasm. Look for Pee Wee
Plowman to score a bunch.

Sorry if we didn’t catch your
act this week. We'll catch you
later. You B Leaguers better
be prepared for Beachball
and the Mad Thinker’s column
next week as they’re going to
write on your atrocities.

You scorers please keep in-
dividual stats so we'll have
something to report. This
column’s going big time, split-
ting like an amoeba, and
anyone who likes the B League ‘
column better than CA and
YB’s will meet an unpleasant

‘death, like terminal jock itch.
