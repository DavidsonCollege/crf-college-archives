_DAVIDSON
FIVE YEARS AGO

No very marked contrast is discernable
between the state of affairs at Davidson
five years ago and the conditions now ex-
isting.

The Wildcat eleven was defeated at
the hands of the heavy Washington and
Lee Generals. Two field goals by Silver-
stein accounted for the 6-0 score regis-
tered, The Generals threatened to score
several time, but could not. break through
the strong Wildcat defense. Captain
Hammett, of Davidson, did some fine
work in breaking up the General’s aerial
attack. Mattox, Washington and Lee
halfback, and now Freshman coach at
Davidson, was the outstanding star. He
was the only man to make any appre-
ciable gains through the Red and Black
line.

Club, Plans were formulated
and a basis for the election of reporters
to the club was stressed. These plans
were calculated to promote greater in-
terest in the work and to make the
“Davidsonian” the “best college weekly
in the South.”

porters’

The students were asked to subscribe
three dollars cach to the 1921 Quips and
Cranks fund, as insufficient funds ex-
isted to guarantee publication of a cred- |
itable annual. The proposition was
brought before the students by C. W.
Long, editor-in-chief, and it met with
the hearty approval of the entire stu-
dent body.

Davidson was honored by a visit from |
Major Mueller, formerly Captain, Com-
mandant and Professor of Military
Science and Tactics here. He viewed
the battalion parade and was pleased |
with the review.

Announcement was made that the Red- |
path Lyceum would present five num-
bers at Davidson, beginning October 11th
with Ralph Bingham, then America’s |

foremost humorist.

A i ; |
The following quotation is from an |

editorial appearing in the October 8, 1920 |
issue of the “Davidsonian”: |
“Just remember also, men, that it does
not cost anything to utter a friendly
grecting, and yet just one or two words
spoken in this way will change the whole
aspect of things. It will make the whole
day seem brighter and you will feel like
you are a real man. Try it, Freshmen,
and see if we are not right.”

YMCA Commences Big

Sunday School Program|

Christian, Sims, Kauffert and Others
Rendering Big Service in Nearby
Churches

The Y. M. C. A. has begun an extensive
program of Sunday School work in the
community for the coming year. In
previous years much good ‘has been ac-
complished through the Sunday “Schools
established and carried on by Davidson
This year G. M. Eddington will
have charge of this department of the
“Y" work.

Every Sunday some of the students
hold services in different parts of the
community, W. A. Christian with a few

jable helpers holds a Sunday School serv-

ice in the afternoon at Hobson’s Chapel.

R. D. Kauffert takes old magazines and
newspapers to the convict camp, and
holds a service for the convicts every
Sunday afternon. Save all the old mag-
azines which you have finished and some-
one will collect them to take to the camp.

A Bible class for young men has been
been established at Cornelius recently.
Roland Sims is going to teach it, and has

ja great opportunity in that field.

A class is held every Sunday morning
at ten o'clock in the balcony of the
church for Davidson students. Five
members of the faculty teach the class in
rotation. There are already about one
hundred members in the class. This
class is steadily growing and the mem-
bers are very enthusiastic over it.

FAMOUS FINANCIER

could succeed. He turned along this line to
show that many times the fault lies with the
parent rather than with the child. He show-
ed that the trouble is not in juvenile delin-
quency but in the ineff:ciency of a parent
or an adult.

“The greatest problem of the democratic
world today is that of leadership. The boy
of today is the leader of tomorrow. There

,must be a conversion of the youth of today

for the financial leadership of tomorrow. A
real man can be made of nothing except a
real boy. And a real woman can be develop-
ed out of nothing except a real girl. The
salvation of the land we love is worked out
by each generation as it comes along. The
thoughtful leaders of affairs have. said that
you will have greater problems to solve than
any other generations.”

Mr. Beck pointed out that the faculty of
Davidson College are giving their all to bring
every student through so that he may be a
leader in his community when he has finished
| school. But in the final analysis he would
have to stand on his own feet without their
assistance.

“Men in the financial world and especially
in New York want a man to work under
them who looks for an opportunity rather
than a dollar mark. I would like to suggest
four things to aid in your carrying out these
things I have set forth. First, have a plan;
there is a genuine peril for any man who
has not a definite plan in view while in his
college career. Second, the need of pur-
pose; lack of this is killing the tomorrows
of more men than anything else today. The
fact that a man can do anything really means
that he do nothing. Third, need of perse-
‘verance; tomorrow wil{ ‘be assured if today
is safe. Fourth, a superhuman passion for
righteousness. Many people are now ap-
proaching the sunset of life with nothing be-
fore them but material gains of life.”

Prof. A. Currie introduced the speaker in
a few well chosen words and also made a

short talk after the lecture which were also

a plaster cast and is not troubling him
as formerly. The flesh wound in his leg,
caused by the bone breaking through, is
healing with great rapidity. It was
sewed up at the time the cast was put on
and has been dressed daily by means of

the wound. Tuesday the leg is to be
ex-rayed to determine whether it is prop-
erly set.

Contrary to expectations, “Nick” was
not able to attend the game Saturday,
but was so well pleased with the outcome
that he was in great spirits after the
game.

After Tuesday visitors will be allowed
to visit him and it is certain that he will
appreciate a visit from any of the stu-
dents. Everything possible is being done
to make him comfortable and his condi-
tion is wonderful. However, he will be
confined for at least three more weeks.

WILMINGTON STUDENTS .

lows from Wilmington, N. C., met in Phi
