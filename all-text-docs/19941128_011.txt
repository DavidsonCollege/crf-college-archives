Dave Matthews no longer Under the Table and Dreaming

By Jon Sands

Finally getting a chance to
show their stuff on a national level,
the Dave Matthews Band released
Under The Table and Dreaming.
This album is the debut release on
their new recording contract with
R.C.A. The first of many to come,
itis packed with some of their best
songs off of Remember Two Things
and a host of other new tracks.
They chose veteran producer
Steven Lillywhite, who has worked
with other successful bands such

as U2, Peter Gabriel, and Talking |

Heads.

Under The Table and Dream-
ing, a line taken from the song
“Ants Marching,” is a long way
from their bootlegs and last fall’s
independent release. The Dave
Matthews Band has put their best
foot forward and emphasized clar-
ity and perfection from song to
song. Their last album has a num-
ber of live songs which skillfully
captured the band at their top form,
but they lacked the funds to pro-
duce an album which shares the
same quality as Under the Table
and Dreaming.

This album has brought out
the qualities of Dave’s song writ-
ing and the band’s eclectic sound
to their fullest potential. With guest
appearances by Blues Traveler’s
John Popper and his dancing Har-
monica on ‘“‘What Would You Say,”
additional energy has been added

women’s backpacking trip to the
gulley rafting trip over fall break.

Currently 34 students are tak-
ing part in Davidson Outdoors’
wilderness training course. These
students attend a two hour class
once a week and recently have
been going through wilderness
skills workshops taught by other
trip leaders.

Students who feel they have
limited free time should take a
study break and head to the climb-
ing wall, open Sunday from 2 to 5
and Monday through Thursday 7-
9, or kayak rolling in Baker Sports
Complex, open Thursday 7-9.
These facilities will remain open
through the week of December 9.

For those who feel they can-
not leave Davidson for an entire
weekend, there are two day trips
on December 3: a bouldering trip
and mountain biking at South
Mountain State Park. Davidson
Outdoors trips give you a chance
to meet people you might never
know and discover your own
strengths in challenging but fun
situations. °

to this already-great track. Songs
of note would have to be “Best of
What’s Around,” “Jimi Thing,” and
“#34.” Each song has its own
tempo and mood, surrounded by
Dave’s distinctive voice and the
combination of an alternative gui-
tar, violin, saxophone, electric bass,
and drums. It is hard to find two
songs that sound too much alike.
The band recently launched
their national tour and stopped by
Wait Chapel in Wake Forest to

thoroughly entertain the sold out
crowd. As Under the Table and
Dreaming gets more national cov-
erage, the band will be harder to
see in the small clubs and amphi-
theaters that they used to frequent.
Because they are musicians and
notentertainers, I think thatit would
a shame to go see Dave Matthews
in a large arena like the Charlotte
Coliseum. I would like to think
that people love the band for their
music and not their pathetic light

show.

Ihave heard through the grape-
vine that “So Much to Say” is
going to be made into music video
format as well as released to major
radio stations around the country.
If you want to know everything
and anything about the band, you
should hop on the internet and sub-
scribe to “Minaret Net.” They will

about the picture that placed be-
hind the disc in the CD package.
Matthews’ little sister was mur-
dered, and he dedicates the album
to her.

I have to recommend highly
this album to one and all at
Davidson and hope that you enjoy
it as much as I have. I should also
mention that if you are having

send you all sorts of good stuff on
the band.

A special note should be made

trouble falling asleep, you should
put “#34” on repeat and fade off
into sweet oblivior.

Boime on Delacroix

By Matt Melton

On Wednesday night, the well-published and critically-acclaimed
art historian Albert Boime lectured on Eugene Delacroix’s Liberty
Leading the People (1830), a history painting in the Louvre. Boime
made this famous painting come alive with his vast historical insight into
the French Revolution and his lively interpretations: of the painting’s
subject matter. As Art Department Chair Larry Ligo says, “We will
never look at this painting the same” due to Boime’s critical.probing of
its social, political, and psycho-sexual iconography.

Boime began his lecture recounting the social situation of France

. during the 1880s, when the French Revolution erupted. Traditionally

known as a social historian, Boime focused on the way that the artwork
reflected the ideologies of its time and place. He emphasized Delacroix’s
fascination with the energy of the lowerclass, describing this as a
Romantic notion of “the domestic other.”

He then addressed the sources for Delacroix’s allegory of Liberty,
a half-nude woman holding the tri-colored flag of modern France. She
symbolically leads the French lowerclass revolutionaries (laborers and
a young street urchin) through a barricade of French imperial corruption.
But Boime focused on Liberty as.a bold leader depicted with a harsh,
unidealized naturalism, far from the passive, sensuous, female stereo-
types of academic artistic tradition in France at this time. Thus Boime
elevated Delacroix’s heroic female allegory as a firm, working-class
woman, a challenge to the traditional male power structure of French
artistic tradition. Boime also discussed Liberty as the subconscious
maternal figure of Delacroix himself. Through various images and
primary accounts, Boime offered valid support what seemed to be far-
fetched social inquiries.

Boime’s critical eye and vast historical research unveiled unfore-
seen realities in this Romantic masterpiece. His attention to the details
offered new vision into the mind of Delacroix and his revolutionary ways

of seeing.
