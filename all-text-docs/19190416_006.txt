Do You Attend the World
Forum? Try it Once

Interesting Discussion On the Christian
Welfare of Our Nation.

The World Forum meeting- last
"Thursday evening was very enjoyable.
Mr. Miles’ interpretation and remarks
on the lesson were well worth the time
of the thirty-five men present. “The sub-
ject of the evening was a continuation
of the subject, “The Call for a Chris-
tian Internationalism,” discussed in a
previous meeting.

The first line of thought was that
“We must Christianize all our Interna-
tional Contracts.” Our business with the
outside world is unchristianized for it
has been conducted on the principles of
close bargain. ‘This has been shown in
the selling contracts for opium, rum,
rubber and the like. We must not only,
chridtianize our business with the out-
side world but we must reform our press,
for by it, people are influenced more than
by any other thing, “Phe Chritian na-
tions must try to mold their character
as a Christian so as to make it count for
the best in this world. The press is the
best means of showing this character. We
have no finer vehicle of friendliness to-
wards other nations than the press, Peo-
ple judge nations by the individual with
which they come in contact. “You can-
not make much headway for the King-
dom of God in the world unless you
make corresponding gains here.”

The second line of discussion was that
“We Must Actively Sprerd the Chris-
tian Message Throughout the World.”
It is only the wide dissemination and ac-
ceptance of the Christian message that
will render safe the various contracts of
which we have been speaking. Unless the
Christian message is carried throughout
the world, peace among the nations will
not hecome secure. For the message of
Christ is characteristically a message of
peace. The spreading of the Christian
message tends to maintain peace because
of its effect upon those who propagate
it. The disseminating of the Christian
doctrine and spirit throughout the world
is necessary for the further reason that
only can our denials of Christ be off-
set.

Another line of thought that was ad-
vanced was the “Negro Condition in the
South.” How approach the question and
by whom it is to be aproached. Put your-
self in the negro’s place. They resent
the very word “negro,” and wherever he
goes he has it thrust upon him that he
is a negro, How would you feel? Ne-
zroes do not want social equality, but
instead they want to work out their
own social problem. Before we can help
them we shall have to change out attitude
toward them. If the negroes were good
enough to go to France to fight, they
need some consideration,

These meetings are very instructive
and it is sincerely hoped that every man
on the hill will accept the public invita-
tion to meet with them.

MOVIES FOR R. O. T. C. MEM-
BERS BEING SHOWN.

The R. O. T. C. has taken on a new
feature. Moving picture films have been
sent here by the government. The films
are the different reels of “The Making
of a Soldier,” gotten out by military au-
thoritics at Washington. Each reel pic-
tures some different phase of the soldiers’
training, equipment etc. Last Monday
night three of these installments were
shown down at the gym. “The Soldier's
Pack.” “The Rifle Grenade” and “The
Browning Gun.” They are very instruc-
tive and interesting. 1t is expected that
some more of this series will be shown
in the near future.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, April 16, 1919
ee _________s_ Een
MINISTERIAL BAND TO HOLD|any unwilling step. There is simply the

Diamond Dust
Live Baseball News Here.

The supply of college pitchers this
season seems to be unlimited. Joyner of
North Carolina pitched a no-hit game
against V. M. L. ‘Vaylor of Virginia held
Carolina to two safeties, Philpot of Geor-
gia has not been scored on in the four
or five games he has pitched this season,
and we have reason to believe that A. &
FE. and Elon are also well supplied in
that department. By striking out fifteen
men in Monday's game, Railroad Clark
has shown he’s as good as the next. one.
Ogiethrope is also developing a star
twirler in Turk who recently pitched
four games on a five game trip, winning
three and striking out fifty-six men.

Caruso Marlette, the Elon Wither-
spoon sang first hase and coached pitch-
er in Monday’s game.

We've finally succeeded in breaking
the one ‘hit game spell, but still a few
more would come in handy.

‘The Phillies touched Walter Johnson
for more hits and more bases to the in-
ning than they averaged on either Currie
or Clark.

After Virginia disposes of Carolina
and Georgia, we'll have some idea where
we stand after taking their measure. If
‘Taylor pitches for Virginia and Philpot
for Georgia the fielders will have a hol-
iday.

Cap Johnson's timely double proven
ted the old whitewash from being applied
and Cassell’s triple broke the one hit
speli so even though the final — score
wasn't exactly satisfactory these _ hits
weren’t wasted.

We hope “Lazarus” Montgomery will
read The Davidsonian for an account of
the first game with Elon. “General Hall”
and “Politician” Wiley were also pre-
vented from giving their undivided at-
tention.

The argument always used in favor of
class baseball is that it now and then
develops a hidden genius as a dark horse.
This amiable steed is evidently suffering
from rheumatism and will arrive a little

A joint meeting with the Volunteer
