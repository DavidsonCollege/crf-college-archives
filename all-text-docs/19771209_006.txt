_ freshman ciass revoit

By WARREN SOULE
Woodrow Wilson once wrote that
hazing was a wonderful thing, if only
it were not entrusted to sophomores.
Dr. Henry Louis Smith, soon after
he became President of Davidson is
1901, instituted a vigorous campaign
for larger numbers of students. By
speeches all over the Piedmont and by
writings he impressed upon young
men of the Church the advantages of
a college education. The Class of 1906
(enrolled in the fall of 1902). was the
result of Dr. Smith’s work and was by
far the largest class in the history of
the College until then. This class was,
on the whole, older than the sopho-
mores, indeed than the regular fresh-
man of that day. It so happened also
that the Sophomore Class of that year
was numerically small--and this situ-
ation invited trouble when hazing
began.

The Class of 1905, however, hazed
the unknowing Freshmen with a zeal
seldom seen, before or since. They
lingered in groups on the second floor
of Old Chambers (at that time a
dormitory for almost half the student
body), and would pour buckets and
barrels of water, often hot, on
freshmen returning from the athletic
field (in between the present union
and Martin Science buildings). They
would wake up unsuspecting Fresh-
men in the middle of the night, tear
off their night shirts, and give them

wet charcoal or tar baths; the victims:

would have to remain in such a state
unless they could jump out of the
second floor window.

This situation invited trouble,
which brewed for several months. On
the night of tne Sophomore banquet
(February, 1903), while the Sopho-
more§ were feasting, the Freshmen
barricaded the front door of Chambers
and when they broke in the Sopho-
mores found their rooms had been
“roughed.’’ (Old Chambers was only
closed in the late spring to keep the
cows on the front campus from
wandering in.) However, they were
dismayed and angry when they were
unable to find anyone to beat. In
some manner they got wind of the
frosh mass meeting: then being held
on Main Street (at Mrs. Frederick-
son’s boarding house), and stormed
up Main Street, up to the porch of the
house, broke down the door, and went
up the stairs. They were stopped
about halfway up by threats of armed
Freshmen who threatened to shoot. It
was the decided to throw rocks
through the windows, but the Fresh-
men had taken the doors off the
hinges and nailed them over the
windows. The suggestion to burn the
building down and take up a subscrip-
tion later to rebuild it was enter-
tained. The president of the Sopho-
more Class stepped forward and
offered to make a truce with the
Freshmen. The terms of the treaty
were that each sophomore should
deliver one lick to each freshman, and
that there should be no more hazing of
that class. Suckers-that they were,
the freshmen fell for it.

The following day a ‘‘student body
meeting’’ was held to which the
freshmen were not invited. It soon
leaked out that it had been unani-
mously decided to revoke the pledge
not :-4@..do.sny hazing. which each

matriculate had to sign when he
registered, and that President Smith
had been notified that they no jonger
considered the pledge binding. The
freshmen called a hurried meeting
during supper, and decided to leave
town on the 7:30 train from Cornelius
to Charlotte, gather on Independence
Square in Charlotte, give the class
yell and sing the Alma Mater one last
time, and leave for home. Afraid of a
struggle if they left from the David-.
son station, they packed and walked
to Cornelius. When the roll was called
at the Cornelius station, only three
were absent, and they lived in
Davidson.

The news that the freshmen had
gone on strike quickly spread, especi-
ally when they were conspicuous in
their absence at YMCA night. Dr.
Grev grabbed his bicycle, and arrived
in time to stall the freshmen. The
train was an hour late, and by that
time Dr. William Joseph Martin had
arrived, riding his grey mare. He
stood in his stirrips and roared:
“You're absolutely right. Your moral-
ity is sound, and your reasoning is
good. Return to the campus, and I de-
fy with my six shooter anyone who
shall attempt to harm you. Use my
front yard for a battle ground, but re-
turn, by heaven, return!

The Class of 1906 returned to the
campus that night with the under-
standing that the class differences
would be sympathetically discussed
and adjusted without molesting the
freshmen.

Minor hostility went on for the
rest of the year, but no great amount
of hazing was recorded, and in the
next year, the Class of 1906 abolished
hazing. This class will always be
remembered for exhibiting that spirit
of college and class spirit which was
seldom equalled. Cooperation ran
high, and hazing was broken up.

Incidentally, they were the first
class to paint their numerals on the
walls of a school building.

Are the police doing everything in their power to

break up the local car theft ring? One car has been

stolen already.
