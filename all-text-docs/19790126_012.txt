I. -
State Senator Arley Harris isn’t going to vote for ERA

By CHARLES ERWIN

RALEIGH, N.C.— Arley
Harris is a politician’s politi-
cian, and that’s not to use the
word in the post-Watergate
sense. {

The 65-year-old state senator
and funeral director from
Cleaveland County said he’s
never garnered less than 80 per-
cent of the vote when it’s gotten
down to counting ballots in
North Carolina’s rural King’s
Mountain district.

In his most recent political
battle, Harris estimated he took
about 85 percent of the vote. ‘‘If
I ever get less than 75 percent
my days as a public servant are
over,” he boasted recently.

How’s he do it?

Weil, for one thing, he said he
listens to the voters in his
district and takes what they
have to tell him dead seriously.

That’s where ERA comes in.

Arley Harris has either spon- .

sored, aided and abetted, or
voted for just about every
measure aimed at halting. sex
discrimination that has been
introduced on the senate floor in
this state for years.

“Since I’ve been here we've
done everything in the world to

The Buttery and Beanery
unique and tasty sandwiches,
savory steaks, salads, and much more.

change laws that were against
women,” he explained. Harris
estimated that in the last two
years alone ‘‘probably 100”
such laws have been successful-
ly revised.

Arley Harris has liked women
for 65 years..He respects them
and wants to help them.

But he’s a stiff opponent of
the Equal Rights Amendment
and says he'll do his best to see
that it doesn’t get through the
Senate during this session.

Why? ,

“Because 75 percent of the
people.in Gaston, Cleaveland,

Rutherford, and (the other .

counties in the King’s Mountain
district) are against it. If I lived
in Charlotte it’d be different,
maybe,’’ he said.

“I don’t think the people
particularly understand ERA. I
don’t think the ones that are
for it understand it. I don’t
think the one’s that are against
it understand it. I’m not even
sure I understand it,’’ he said.

_ “I’ve got no hang-up about
bathrooms,” Harris explained.
“Even the way things are now,
you can get privacy. . . just go

in and lock the door.

“I don’t have a hang-up
about homosexuals and the
chance that they could get
married. As long as they keep it
to themselves, they don’t bo-
ther me.”’

“The reason I’m against it is
because I’m a combat veteran of
World War II, one of the
‘bastards of ‘Bastion’ and I’d
hate to think of my great-
granddaughter in a combat
zone.

“They say that won’t hap-
pen. But what's to keep a young
man who doesn’t want to serve
from bringing the case before
the Supreme Court?”

Harris doesn’t give the ERA
much of a chance in the Senate
this year. He said some of the
people who voted for it have
either died or been defeated.
Some of the people who replaced

_ them are opposed to it.

And for a politician's politi-
cian it’s just as well.

“The day I announced my -

candidacy for the Senate the
last. time, I announced in the

Shelby-Davis Store that I .

would vote against ERA and I
led the Democratic ticket in the
primary,” gleamed Harris.

Midwinters

Multi-talented Atlanta performer Cy Timmons will kick off
-Midwinters weekend Thursday night in the 900 Room.

It’s almost time for the second big weekend of the year:
Midwinters! During next weekend, there are several Midwinters
events lined up for your entertainment.

The weekend starts on Thursday with a performance by Cy

_ Timmons in the 900 Room.

Timmons is from Atlanta, where he is part owner: of the Cafe
Erehwon and a regular performer at the Tree on Peachtree. Several
Atlantans have told me that he is quite well known in the city for
his guitar/vocal style, his hilarious Berry White imitation, and his
unusual ability to do vocal imitations of flute, sax, and trombone.

According to David Huie, he may be “‘the new Josh White, Jr.”

A concert is slated for Friday night, but: the artist hasn’t been
announced yet. Because of scheduling difficulties, the Concert
Committee members, despite frantic work, said they haven’t been
able to finalize a contract.

On Saturday, the main event will be a formal dance in the
Gallery, featuring the Lloyd Hinson Orchestra. Rumor has it that<
the orchestra is quite good, with a contemporary repertoire. Here’s
your chance to dress to impress!

Of course there will also be the usual parties on the court—they'll
be listed next week.
