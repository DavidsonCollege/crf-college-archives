Walter MacDonald gave. the
general. plans of the Great Issues

mittee is receiving $1900 from
the college, $2000 from the

several years ago. .

Nationally known speakers
will be invited to talk with in-
terested students each Thursday
night. There will be discussion
groups during chapel period on
Friday mornings. The topic for
the first semester is “Emerging
Nations:" for the second, ‘Prob-
lems of the Changing South.”
In order to save money, speak-
ers will be “shared” with other!
colleges in this area.

Spratt advised the council to:
begin making plans for election|
procedure changes next fall in-
stead of waiting until spring. He!
said that some changes will have!
to be made. !

Having voted to change Home-
coming, the representatives then
broke into a discussion of whom
to have in concert Kelley said
that the fee of $23 per fraterni-
ty man would total roughly to
$17,500. leaving abou’ $4000 for
the big weekends and $2900 for
the concert weekends

Kelley listed the groups with-
in the IFC's price range and ask-
ed the representatives to bring
back to Monday's meeting their
fraternities’ wishes. The IFC will
definitely decide Monday night
as to whom they want for Home-
coming. leaving only the prob-
lem of contracts to b= signed.

Article X, as passed. includes
the following provisions.

“The campus security officer
will report the name of the in-
dividual! ‘violator, the fraternity

Facts On Class Of ‘67

BY TOM CRAIG
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The admissions office has announced statistics on the class of 1987, which will]

west and the Southweast.
White stated that the increase
was most notable in Pennsyl-
vania, which will be represent-
ed by nine freshmen, and New
Jersey, the home of eight.

Scholastically, the Class of ’67
will rank as high as or higher
than the Class of ‘66. The Scho-
lastic Aptitude Test scores aver-
age will be approximately the
same.

“Six winners of National
Merit Scholarships plan to enter
Davidson next fall," White stat-
ed. “Since in the previous seven
years of the National Merit
Scholaeship Program Davidson

has had but 22 winners enroll.| g
this is quite a record.”

The Class of 1967 is unique
in two ways. First, it is the first
class whose members may re-
ceive advanced placement on
the basis of the College Board
tests to be given in May.

Second, White emphasized,
“This is the last class entering
Davidson which will not have
been required to take the Cal-
lege Board Achievement Tests
in three subjects. As we realized
that 60 per cent of the appli-
eants had taken the tests ariy-
how, the faculty voted to require
any three.”
