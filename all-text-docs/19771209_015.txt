IMAC Report — "3 1 a

Burned-out B-Ballers bravely bound

By BAD BERNARD
AND HOGMAN

Immediately “after last
year’s championship game in
which the SAEs downed the
Phi Delts by one point at the
buzzer, players were heard
leaving the gym mumbling
about their team’s chances for
the nextyear. Well, that year is
here, and the teams and
players seem better than ever.

Returning from last year’s
SAE championship team are
several starters and a wealth
of talent moves up from last
year’s junior varsity.

The Delts have opted for a
name change, gone under new
sfront office management, and
with their signing of several
free agents from next door,
they may prove to be the
strongest team in the league.

But it is no longer a two
team race--that is not if a
Woodberry by the name of
White and a Blackberry by the
name of Piercy have ariything
to do with it.

Included in this year’s
handbook are all the statistics
on your favorite players,
teams, and coaches. Bernie
and Hogman have worked
long hours, scouting practices
and interviewing players, and
we hope you will enjoy this

handbook as much or more

than our others.

HOGMAN DANDY DOZEN

Every year we try to let
you know which players to
watch, and this year we feel we
can offer you twelve legitimate
All-IMAC preseason candi-
dates. Some are established
names and legends in IMAC
circles, while others are rela-
tively new and promise not to
be sleepers for long.

1. Andy McDonald--6’3’’
185--Could be most under-
rated player in IMAC--jumper
that won’t quit and team
player all the way. Could be
key for SAEs second straight
title.

2. Locke White--6’2”’ 175
Left DC varsity over salary
dispute possibly owns the best
jump shot in IMAC--great
penetrating guard with deadly
passes.

3. Stan Brown--6’5’” 205
strong player in all aspects of
the game--good shooting
touch, but must work on his
2.3 rpg--Davidson coach Ed

Farrell said, ‘Stan isthe type:

player a team must have to
win.”

4. Gifford Piercy--6'1" 180 a
great leaper wha could lead his
frosh hall to the promised

land--still must prove he can
be a consistent scorer against
tougher opponents.

5. Rob Murray--6’ 165 great
all-round team player and
hustler who led his team to the
finals a year ago. Jumper is
good all the way to 18 feet and
he can ignite a dynamic break
which can turn any game
around.

6. Bob Lapple--6’ 190 physi-
cal guard who was nicknamed
Dr. Dunk because of his
superb leaping ability. Good
jump shooter, but unfortuna-
tely he passes like John Ger-
dy.

7. Tim Stoll--6’6”’ 215 a
sleeper through freshman year
and then looked tough in
playground summer league
play. A moose of a man with a
good shooting touch--Could
emerge as best big manin A
league.

8. David Jones--6’6’’ 185
missed most of last year due
to injuries--a great shooter for
a big man and he is very agile
around the boards--must be
more physical and more con-
sistent.

9. Min
Accom

inclair--6’1"" 175
Piercy in what

may be the best freshman
backcourt to ever play A
league. True hustler from the

IN ACTION against Converse, Sally Bondurant laun
moves in for position. Look for a women’s basketball story next week.

word go. Has a nice shot and
gives the ball up when team-
mates are open.

10. Paul Collins--6’6’’ 190
Quick forward with moves
around the hole similar to
Albert King. Called ‘tex’ by
his teammates, the big kid can
whip outlet passes the length
of the court.

11. Mike Peskosky-6’2”’ Ap-
propriately known as the en-
forcer of intramurals--distant
relative of Maurice Lucas--has

the power game of a Dantley

and at tournament time he can
pull shots out of his boxer
shorts.

12. Tim Goodell--6’5” 200
Must combine with Bondurant
and Daisley to give the re-
bounding Es need for their
running game--possesses a
siht-jump shot and is very:
team oriented.

Possible Breakthroughs:
George Flowers, Adrian Wil-
son, Bill Sherwood, Scott
Logan, Terry McDonald, Chip
Bondurant, Mike Daisley
Bobby Lasley, Charles Taylor,
Powell Slaughter, Fly Wil-
liams, Eddie Pollock, Mike
Schafer, Bill Sellars, Bo Mc-
Grath, Chris Dodds, and
Stoney Reuning.

FIVE TEAMS TO WATCH

1. Mothership Connection
Well coached club by senior
Mike Knowles. They are well
stacked up from with (Liberty)
Belle Erdman and Jane Per-
kins (Steak and Cake) working
in the front office. Knowles
will emphasize a fast break
oriented attack and this year
he has the material to do this.
Only weakness could by incon-
sistent play from the big men.

2. SAE #1--Wilson and
Brown return from an unde-
feated ball club last year. The
SAEs were defeated earlier in
this year in 3 on 3 play and it
is hard to say what type of
effect this will have on team

morale. Bondurant returns
from Europe but he must
eventually realize that a tennis
racket is not used in round-
ball. Goodell, Daisley,
McDonald and Reuning are all
new and must blend in.

3. Hurtin’ for certin’
Highest rank ever given to a
freshman hall. To compete
someone must emerge as a
dominste pivotman. Could be
Tornetto...Porter and Merten

are physical on the boards but |

too short. Piercy and Sinclair
are tough and backed up by
Dillard and Sealander.

4. McFunk and Dr. Dunk
Team could be tough despite
poor choice of name What can
one say about Locke White,
the multi-talented guard?
Stroud and Schafer are both
tough, but Woodall and Rat-
liff must prove themselves
down under the bucket before
this team is a contender.

5. Tie between Hand Sown,
Home Grown and Tex’s KAs.
Both teams have the big men
it takes to win, but it is still
too early to predict their
outcomes.

In the B League it looks as
if the Reign of Terror (What
are these guys doing in the B
League) could be an easy
winner. Challenging them will
be the gentlemen and scholars
known as the Squatty Bodies.
To be a Squatty Body one
must be under six feet tall and
over 200 pounds. They rely on
their qhickness and tend to be
shy of the physical game
which takes place under the
boards.

One Final Note: A Bad
Bernard and Hogman congra-
tulation to Mr. George Bright
who busted the century barrier
this week as he consumed 100
beers in a mere seven days.
Way to go George and we give
you our best wishes as you
recover.
