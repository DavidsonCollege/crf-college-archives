‘Department stages =

“dream play”

‘By ESTHER BRUCE

a wanted to do a play which
would put all the emphasis
on the actor and the word.”

Judy Kelly, guest director
from the University of Dallas,
_has found just such a play in
Dylan Thomas’ Under Milk

Wood, to be performed here
January 24th and 25th. The
play lends Kelly the opportun-
ity she was seeking to “see what
actors would do with nothing

The play is somewhat experi-
mental in structure and stag-
ing. Each actor plays three or
four parts in scenes which are
constantly shifting and blend-
ing into one another. No props
or sound effects other than what
the actors themselves create are
used. =:

The play dramatized the
dream of a blind, old sailor,
Captain Cat. Kelly manipulates
the actors through a void in a
fashion which compounds and
underscores the dream aspect.
One scene melts into another
with as much speed and as little
logic as any real dream.

The script itself prompts the

changes. Kelly observed, “Like _

dreams, it has that strange
juxtaposition of reality versus
fantasy.”” She went on to ex-
plain that a scene set in thé past
may be placed next to one set in
the present which in turn is
followed by one which is total
fantasy.

Under Milk Wood also pro-

vides an opportunity for a
relatively large number of peo-
ple to work with an outsider,
another director with a different
approach. Both Kelly and the
Davidson Theater professors
took the cast size into account
when selecting the play. Tho-
mas’ play was especially good,
as it evens out the exposure and
does not focus on one star. In
this production about 15 people
play some 55 parts.

This visit is not Kelly’s first

‘to Davidson. She accompanied

her husband, Pat Kelly, in 1977
when he directed Euripedes’

Alcestis. The Kellys are able to |

spend time at Davidson because

‘ of the scheduling differences

between the University of Dal-
las and Davidson.
Kelly received an assistant-

ship to the theater department é

of Marquette, which she claims
was her best training ground.
The University of Dallas turned
to her at this point. Kelly
explained, ‘‘Dallas had always
wanted a theater department.
They invited me to come back
and found the theater depart-
ment there.”’

The Kellys met theater pro-
fessor Rupert Barber when they
three attended a colloquium on

- Directing in Modern Theater in

1963. They kept in close touch
over the years, always hoping
to work out a swap of directors

such as this one. Unfortunately, ©

scheduling difficulties arose in
getting one of Davidson’s The-
ater professors to Dallas in
return.

volunteer services benefit campus

By CATHERINE McMILLAN
What would YOU do if
someone on your hall suddenly
fainted in your room? One
freshman student had the right
idea when she called for David-
son’s student-run emergency
rescue service. Within minutes,
two student Emergency Medi-
cal Technicians were on hand.
The College has eight certi-
fied EMT’s in its volunteer
emergency rescue service. To
become certified, they took 150
hours of advance first-aid train-
ing. “The~ prez , Started se-
veral years ago by Bob roigits¢
79, has been an effective ser-
vice to both the college and

Dick Deibert, the head of the
service, ges everyone to
use it. “‘Our service is not

confined to emergencies. It’s no

campus—that's exactly why we
have volunteered our services.”

three days.

EMT's are prepared to handle
real emergencies, but they are’
also willing to give advice about
simple injuries, escort students
to the infirmary, or even sug-

gest whether a trip to the
infirmary is necessary.

The infirmary nurse is the
first person contacted in an
emergency. She takes down the
location and the nature of the
problem, and then pages the
two EMT’s on duty. One EMT
gets necessary equipment while
the other goes immediately to

‘the scene of the accident.

Deibert said the biggest
problem has been caller impa-
ticnee.-The nurse needs certain
information before s2¢.can dis-
patch the EMT’s so that they
will be prepared to handle the
call. It saves time in the
long run to answer questions
patiently. EMT's take an aver-
age of two minutes to arrive
after they have been paged.

The EMT’s are pleased with
the response of Davidson stu-
dents to the service this year.
They average 4 call every two or

‘‘We’ve treated
everything froin severe lacer-
ations to diabetic reactions to
sprained ankles,” said Deibert.
So far this year, the EMT's
have treated a cheerleader who
fell on her head, a head-on

flickerball- collision, fingers
slammed in a door, burns, and
auto accidents. ‘‘In fact,”’ Dei-
bert said with a chuckle, “last
night we got called out to treat
an intoxicated guy who fell
down the stairs.”’ Jeanne Plow-
den, one of two girls on the
squad, says, ‘I’ve only been
sent out into the community
once. That was for an elderly
person who fell out of bed.”

Is it a big demand on the
EMT’s time? Plowden frowns
thoughtfully, and then says,
‘*‘Not' too much. Sometimes
having to be on campus helps
because it forces me to study. If
we really have to leave, we can
usually work ont. a switch with

someone who's going to be here-

anyway.”

The EMT’s feel that theirs is
an important service. They
stress the fact that it is low-key

and that callers should not be ;

intimidated. “When you call,
you won’t get a half'a dozen
police cars and ambulances,”
said Deibert. Plowden thinks

' the closeness is important. “(A

lot of times a student will get
hurt and not want to call an
ambulance in Cornelius, but he
will call an EMT.”

Two EMT's will be. gradu-
ating this year. Deibert is
looking for new volunteers.
