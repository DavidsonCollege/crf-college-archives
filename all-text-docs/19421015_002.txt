Christmas Holidays . ...
a form letter to colleges of the South
requesting that they extend their Chris:.

Several of these institutions bave an-
nounced their plans to¢ comply with the
request. Davidson has as yet taken no
action on the tatter although it was
to be submitted to the executive com-
rrinee this week.
_ On the suriaee this plan has several
outstanding merits.

ODK Drive >... -

ODN announced this week its inten-
tion of sponsoring a movement to cut
down on the damage to college property
caused annually by both thoughtless and
calculating offenders, should there be
any.

The evident necessity of such a drive,
as pointed out in periodic chapel talks,
is embarrassing to any student thought-
ful of his own rights and those of his
college mates and school.

The perennially hackneyed argument
that we should be adult enough to re-
Spect the sanctity of the possessions of
others by thé time we enter college is
apparently inadequate, regardless of its
truth.

Equally hackneyed and equally in-
adequate are the appeals to the “David-
son gentlemen”, and_ the annually in-
creasing punishments and deductions

from the entirely adequate damage fee.

In the present emergency, however,
the age-old excuses of the culprits have
become even more inadequate. Too long,
as we have contended before, have the
costly pranks of campus jesters been
catalogued “thoughtlessness" and laugh-
ed off by all but the administrative de-
partment and the college repair force.

Anyone who can drop a paper filled
with news of shortage in transportation
materiel of all kinds, and particularly
labor, and who can then summon the
nerve to deliberately toss a rock through
a dormitory window, is . . . well, the
Kind of man ODK would like to convert.

To bring this point closer home, one
of the already over-taxed college staff
resigned to take a war labor job this
week. The others simply do not have
the time to chase around replacing
smashed panes and damaged doors.

Perhaps you are getting tired of hav-
ing everything put on a patriotic basis,
but until this war is definitely won we
are duty-bound to do everything in our
power. to_hasten victory. even to the
annoving extent of refraining from our
peaceful destruction. of- valuable prop-
erty.

turally be eliminated, should the idea
te adopted.

From the point of view of the students.
it wotid give those who have to travel
long distances more time at home during
their favorite season of the year. These
students would not miss the spring re-
cess. beeause of slower travel or they
would not think it worthwhile to spend
the eniice week on a train or bus for only
a iew howrs with their parents.

For the seniors who plan to graduate
in lebruary, the added week to their
last vacation would doubtless be appre-
ciated, as it would be by those who view
their college carcers with a day to-day
attitude.

Student opinion generally favors the

plan apparemiy, provided the necessary
adjustments in the academic schedule

could be made. With traveling eondi-
tions as urpleasani as they must be.
any suggestion for their rekei meets
v'th hearty approval on the campus.

Scrap .. 3

We have said very little in an edi-
torial way about the current drive for
serap metal not because we do not ap-
prove heartily of everything it hopes to
ateomplish, but because we do not see
that the students are in a position to aid
vecy materially in the effort.

There have been several suggesuons
that we advocate the donation of the
pes and chains which bound the grass

ce ceriain areas of the campus, also the.

“tL “re escape from the Martin Chem-
vonl T aboratory.

We suspect that plans have already
been made for the latter. but the pipe
and chain idea might bear investiga-
tion.
raths across the campus everyone knows

have, we suspect, lost even their nui-
sance value.

Another interesting bit of scrap which
would ‘be well worth ressurecting is the
old World War T cannon which used to
‘guard Chambers and which was last
seen in the underbrush_behind the fresh-

With The Staff

Government officials are frequent-
ly proposing new plans to help the
united nations to win-the war. Tray-—
eling is no longer convenient, since
lires and gasoline are limited and
thus space on trains and buses. This
raises a problem which has been
mentioned before—what will college
students do about their weekend
trips?

Some of us acquire quite a lot of
energy that-makes us go wild after
too long a time in one place. We
have been accustomed to burn out
this energy on weekends when off
the campus, where our play -will not

much of this wild-life energy has
been stored in us and caused the
