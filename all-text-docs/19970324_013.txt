Kruse’s Cubby:
Feedback
fodder

By MIcHAEL Kruse
Sports Editor

I seem to have garnered a
reputation as a lightning rod for
controversy.

People often don’t like what
I write and sometimes they don’t
like what I don’t write.

For example, much was
made of last week’s section. I
received a handful of voice mails
— some more civil than others
— and was confronted by a rep-
resentative from the women’s ten-
nis team. They were all in re-
sponse to what they thought was
insufficient coverage of certain
sports.

That’s OK though. It’s more
than OK, actually. I welcome
any feedback, good or bad. It
shows me that people are reading

and that people care. But I know | ;

I’m not going to please all of the
people all of the time. That’s not
my goal:

I strive to write and edit to
the best of my ability. By the
time I graduate in two years
(hopefully), I want this section to
be the best small college weekly
sports page in the country. AndI
really think we’re on our way.

Will and I have. been. part-
ners in crime for a year and a half
now. I feel we havestarted some-
thing special. But Will is step-
ping down next fall. Aaron
Dunham will take his place.
Aaron and I and our staff will
continue to do what we think is
necessary to reach our ultimate
goal.

That’s not to say there won’t
be some subtle — and some not
so subtle — changes in proce-
dure. So consider the following
a miniature mission statement
written a few months in advance.

I. Our resources are lim-
ited.

It is impressive that
Davidson can fund any Division
I teams at all, but truly amazing
that it fields more than most gar-
gantuan state schools.

Universities across the coun-
try are, due to budget constraints,
discontinuing non-revenue sports
such as wrestling or golf.
Davidson, so far, has not.

Believe me,I’dlovetocover
everything. But to do so, we'd
need unlimited space and a
sprawling corps of staffers, two
things we most definitely don’t
have.

We must, therefore, set pri-
orities.

2. Basketball, soccer, and
football will, more often than not,
receive more coverage than other
sports.

Like it or not, these are the
biggies, the crowd-grabbers, the
money-makers.

Not everybody cares about
them, but more people do than,
say, field hockey or lacrosse.

Lacrosse finds winning ways on the road

By WILL BRADSHAW
Sports Editor

After a string of games marked
by inconsistent play, the women’s
lacrosse team’ (1-3) traveled to
Maryland on Saturday and drubbed
Columbia University, 17-7, for their
first win of the season.

“It was a close game in. the
beginning, and what we did to them
in the second half is what other
teams have been doing tous,” coach
Mary Schwartz said. “We have the
skills, the form, the technique. Now
we have to work on how to win, and

that is hard teach. It has to come
from them (the players).”

Davidson jumped out to atwo-
goal lead, but then fell behind by
one. That led to a barrage of Wild-
cat goals and an 8-3 lead, but Co-
lunibia closed the first half with two
unanswered tallies.

“When we got up by so many,
I think we relaxed,” goalie Lisa
Benjamin said. “We realized you
can’t do that in lacrosse. You have
to be intense the whole game or you
won’t win. That’s what made the
difference.”

In the second half, Columbia

never had a chance. Davidson

poured in nine goals compared to ‘

Columbia’s two, and Benjamin,
who stopped 11 first half shots,
only had to turn back three attempts
in the second frame due to
Davidson’s improved defense.
“The first three games were
frustrating, because we’re a better
team than that,” Benjamin said. “We
didn’t play to our potential, but we
showed that we really can do it on
Saturday. Hopefully we’ll build
from here and get better and better.”
The team opened their official
match season Feb. 28 with a home

game against Vanderbilt. The Com-
modores escaped with a 9-5 vic-
tory. Villanova rolled into town on
Mar. 5 and handled the Wildcats,
21-4.

After the Villanova game, the
team had a few days off, and when
they returned Fleck says they made
a pact with each other to help in-
crease their on-field intensity.

“We’re having a hard time
(learning to work as a unit consis-
tently). We’re working at it, but it’s
taking a while to get to that point,”

Despite a strong outing from
senior hurler Jonathan Coulombe
Sunday, the baseball team dropped
the rubber game of a weekend
series against perennial regional
power Georiga Southern, 5-4.

Coulombe, who threw over
150 pitches, yielded just three
earned runs in his complete game
effort. He also struck out nine,
while walking just two.

“Jonathan pitched a great
game forus today,” said Davidson
head coach Dick Cooke. “He had

he kept the ball low.”

The Wildcats were trailing 3-
2 before Jeff Coker smashed a
one-out double in the eighth. Fol-
lowing an Anderson Marvin
ground-out, Brian Penny cracked
his first home run of the season,
giving Davidson (10-19) a4-3 lead.

But the Eagles (16-14) would
respond. In the ninth, Antoine
Moran singled home the tying run
and Matt Meadows followed with
a game-winning base hit to right.

Georgia Southern closer Tod
Lee struck out the side in the bot-

victory for the Eagles.

“Georgia Southern is a great
team,” explained Cooke. “They
have three pitchers (including Lee)
who will be drafted very high in
the draft. They have a chance to
make a lot of things happen this
season.”

On Saturday, the Eagles
opened the series with an 18-5
rout. Moran, Steve Walson, and
Jaime Olvey led the Eagle on-

command of all of his pitches and

tom half of the ninth, sealing the ©

slaught with three hits apiece.

The Wildcats evened the series
behind the solid pitching perfor-
mance from freshman Eric Bowers.
In Davidson’s 4-3 win, Bowers
yielded three hits in just over five
innings, and struck out six.

Gus Quattlebaum again led
Davidson offensively, hitting his
10th home-run of the season, while

Left-fielder Brian Joyce digs in at the plate against Georgia Southern pitcher Ryan Cummings during
the Wildcats Conference matchup against the Golden Eagles this Saturday at Wildcat Park.

Baseball plays well but drops rubber
game to conference power on Sunday

picking up three runs batted in.
On Tuesday, the Wildcats
battled back to defeat cross-rival
UNC Charlotte, 12-9. But Wake
Forest handed the Wildcats a 22-3
drubbing on Thursday to give
Davidson a 2-3 mark for the week.
“Obviously, we would have
liked to have won that third game
against Georgia Southern,” said

Cooke. “But we have to put things
in perspective and realize that we
played very well this weekend.
“Right now things are im-
proving. Our pitching is still in-
consistent but we’re giving guys
experience and we continue to
play pretty good defensively. We
just need to put it all together.”

Golf battles tough competition and academic schedule

By MIcHAEL KRUSE
Sports Editor

The golf team continues to face
the stiffest competition in school
history.

And while a 19th place finish..

at the 24-team East Carolina Invita-
tional last week in Greenville is
nothing to cheer about, the hope is
that the challenging docket will pay
dividends down the road.

“The competition is the best

we’ ve ever been up against,” coach
Joe Mark said yesterday, referring
to an ECU field that featured pow-
erhouses suchas Eastern Kentucky,
Michigan St., Maryland, Virginia
Tech, and James Madison.

That isn’t the only opposition
for the golfers, though, who are
forced to continually battle
Davidson’s stringent classroom re-
quirements and uncompromising
professors.

Because golf courses cannot

host college tourneys on weekends,
most matches for the Wildcats hap-
pen in Monday-Tuesday or Thurs-
day-Friday formats.

Soforthe second straight week,
the golfers were forced to play with-
out their regular five-man lineup.

Jason Lina paced the Wildcats
at ECU, shooting a three-round to-
tal of 223.

Jason Carlock followed with a
224 and Daniel Tedrick added a
234.

David Alexander and Alby
Toto rounded out Davidson’s ros-
ter.

The squad wraps up its regular
season April 6-8 at Buies Creek,
N.C., and travels to Greensboro
April 13-15 for the Southern Con-
ference tournament.

.“‘We’renot playing consistently
right now, unfortunately,” said
Mark. “But maybe we can get that
way before the conference champi-
onships.”
