College Catalogue To
Appear At Early Date

The Davidson College Catalo-
gue is now in the hands of the
printers and will be published
about the middle of February.

There are only a few changes
from the catalogue of 1935, The
change of most interest to stu-
dents is the new numbering of
courses, Students desiring copies
of the catalogue can obtain them
in the Registrar's office during
the latter part of February.

Mr. Hengeveld has announced
that the registration of the class
of 1940 is now under way. Stu-
dents knowing prospective fresh-
men are requested to turn in the
names of these men so that they
may be put on the College's mail-
ing list.

Salem Methodist
Shows Way to Avoid

Disillusionment

HISTORY PROVES TEXT

Defeat Soured Crusaders;
Fears For Misled Youth

‘the Neve Dr Ge ke jordan;
pastor of the Second Methodist
Chureh of Winston Salem,
Was the preacher at the Ves
per service on Feb. 2, his gen

eral topie being “The Choice
of an Ideal.”

The Rev. Jordan took his seripture
from the Gospel of St. Matthew and
based his sermon on parts of two
verses: “Seek ye first the Kingdom
of God,” and “Take up thy cross.”

Phroughout his address the min
ister emphasized the necessity ot
choosing an ideal which will not, in

the long run, betray one. He showed

that Giten ideals play falsely with the

owners, proving his. statement with

several examples. The Crusades, Rey

Jordan ssaid, had a high ideal, but
despite this the failure of the move
ment and the poor spirit of the lead
ers point out the fact that the ideal

betrayed its holders

In continuing this thought, Dr. Jor
dan quoted several other examples. C
I. Montague was disillusioned in the

World War and became cynical be

cause his ideal—the good that could
come out of the war—turned against
him. In Germany and Italy the peo-

ple cling to what they believe to be
the highest
niably true, Rey, Jordan stated, that

of ideals, yet it is unde-

they will eventually see that their ideal
not what they imagined it to be.
To keep from becoming disillusion-
ed, the speaker continued, one must
have the very highest of ideals, an
ideal which will not betray one. “The
only thing worthy of your soul is the

is

soul of Christ; the only thing worthy
of giving your whole to is the thing
at the center of the personality and
life the Master.”
