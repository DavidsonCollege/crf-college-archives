Smith, Thornwell F.,
rath Battery Anti-Aircraft.

"h1, private,

Captain McLendon writes of Chap-
lain B. R. Lacy, ‘06, as follows: “Phere
is a tremendous value in knowing you
are right in the sight of Him who judges
both nations and individuals; and I have
often come to the conclusion that there
is more behind our efforts than mere
numbers and weight.of guns and ammu-
nition, It would have done your heart
good to have seen our service one rainy
Sunday not long ago. Parson Ben Lacy
came down and my boys had a service
all their own out under the trees in the
rain. We sang from his little song book
old familiar songs and he read a short
passage and left us this message: {Put
not your trust in horses and chariots, but
in the Lord Thy God.’ Lacy is the most
wonderful man I ever saw. He preaches,
buries the dead, and fights day and night,
and. does all equally well. He ought to
be awarded every medal and honor ever
granted.” Chaplain Lacy was last spring
elected Vice-President of the Davidson
Alunini Association.

Chaplain T. M. Bulla, ‘07, who only
this week entered Davidson's _ Honor
Roll, was killed just a few days before
the close of the war by a German shell.
He was a nian of beautiful spirit, a min-
ister greatly loved, and widely useful.

A letter, dated November 6, received
recently by his people in Garland, N. C.,
states that W. H. Sloan, '10, who has
been in the service a year was gassed on
October 17. At the time of the writing
of the letter he was much better, though
not yet allowed to sit up or write letters.

Cc. D. MONTGOMERY.

The news has recently come that
Lieut. Charles D. Montgomery, ‘09. of
Atlanta, was struck by a shell and killed
on October 15 in battle in the Argonne
forest. Lieutenant Montgomery was
stationed at Camp Greene last winter
and became widely acquainted in Char-
lotte circles. He was ‘in the 9th Ma-
chine Gun Battalion at the time of his
death.

Only last week The Davidsonian pub-
lished a letter in its Alumni section from
Lieutenant Montgomery, at that time
not nowing of his mortality. Lieutenant
Montgomery is well known among Da-
vidson alumni, possessing a host of warm

Lfiring line.

triends. He was an active student when
in college. taking an interest in a large
number of student activities. He is re-
membered for his great warm heart, and
above all, for his nobleness of character.
The Davidsonian expresses its sympathy
toward his people in their sorrow,

N. MORTON ‘18

The Greensboro News of November
26 contained in its casualty list the name
of “T. N. Morton, °18, Oxford, N.C.
as died of disease. It had been rumored
on the campus in the carly fall that
Morton, who was in France, had ‘died
of pneumonia. The rumor was discred-
ited however by the arrival of a letter
from him shortly afterwards. The Da-
vidsonian has been. unable to find the
date of his death and the nature of the
disease. It is very probable that his
death was caused by pneumonia, due to
exposure. His was the third death from
pneumonia among last year’s graduates
who have gone into the service.

Morton graduated with the A. B. de-
gree on last May 29. On the next day
he entered the service, enlisting in the
Artillery of the Regular Army. His
regiment was stationed at Fort “Thomas,
Ky.. for several weeks, and then was
sent across later in the summer. The
regiment received strenuous training
during this time and soon was on the
Morton wrote back on Sep-
tember 29, “IL ani up where the fun is.
Things have changed and here 1 am
ever here in the mud... . It is
rather exciting to hear the shetls whistle
through the air. | have been on my job
for a day and night at the time without
rest and can get away with it. 2...
I like it very well but 1 don’t care how
fast old “Tempus fugit until the dove
of peace flies over the land.” Morton
was a soldier, with the spirit as well as
the name of a Regular. His was the
dauntless fervor, the true service, and,
finally, the supreme sacrifice, of noble
young manhood,

Morton was a favorite with all on
the campus during’ his four years, be-
ing regularly known as “TT. N.” He
was always cheerful, ever ready for a
conversation; and many were those who
sought his companionship when possessed
with “the blues.” He was fond of re-
lating his plans of becoming a great
lawyer and going to South America
when college and university days should
be over. (He chose France instead).
His classmates valued him as a student
of brilliant intellect, with a future of
greatness before him. ‘I. N.” was a
faithful worker in the Philanthropic
Literary Society. He further made for
himself a record for punctuality while in
college. His death comes as a blow to
all. The college has made in him a
noble gift to the Cause of Freedom;
and his friends shall long cherish his
memory. The Davidsonian sends _ its
sympathy to his parents and loved ones
in their sorrow,

KITCHEN POLICE

Sitting here in the kitchen, pealing a
bucket of spuds,

Wearing a dirty apron to cover my blue
serge duds,

A hundred thousand in the bank, ‘“So-
ciety man"—that's me;

*} Just because I was late at roll call, they

gave me a week's K. P.

Sitting here in the kitchen, with slops
all over my jeans;

Picking rocks and splinters out of a
barrel of beans,

My thoughts have gone a-wandering to

¢ what I used to be

Before | missed that. last post car and

they game me a week's K. P.

I think of the nights I squandered do-
ing the bar room stunt;

Gee! what a sissy 1 was—what a hope-
less, hopeless runt!

Oh, | was there with the girls, boys,
and they called me a “lady’s man,”

What would they say if they saw me
now scraping a greasy pan?

The mess sergeant’s a slaver, he gives
aman no rest,

The first cook is a villain, but | hate

the second best.

sure boys, I've enlisted to march

away to war,

they've got me here in the kitchen

doing the company chores,

Oh,

A week policing the kitchen, watching

Me, who used to order two thousand
men around,

J wonder what two thousand would say
if they saw me now,

Washing a hundred dishes ready for

‘Two months ago in a greenhouse, | held
Anita’s hand,

Told her that I had enlisted to fight
for ‘my native land,

She'd be proud, all right, if she saw

Swabbing the slimy mush pan until my

Fixing the hash for supper, putting ice
