FIRST APPEARANCE
OF REPORTS MADE

The appearance of the first monthly re
ports during, the past week brought to a}
close a season of varied expectation and |
dread within the school, bringing satisfac-
tion to some students, and demonstrating |
to those less studiously inclined a need for
greater concentration on their subjects.

Pointing out as it does the general trend |
of the individual, the chief value of this |
first card lies in its capacity as a check |
upon the . work the The |
freshmen may gain especial benefit from |
it in this way. |

of students.

Reports were mailed not only to every
man at college, but also to the parents or
guardian of each one.

Low grades received this time will act |
as “an incentive rather than as a discour-
agement.

The next reports are due to be mailed
in about five weeks, and will offer a splen-
did chance for students who have not
quite attained, as yet, the desired mark, |
to vindicate themselves. |

Wife of Dr. Vowles
Recovering Speedily

|

Davidsonians will be glad to know that
Mrs. Guy P. Vowlés, who has been con-
valescing in Statesville for two weeks, will
return to her home here Sunday or Mon-
day.

Mrs. Vowles is the wife of Dr. Guy P.
Vowles, head of the department of Ger-
man in the college. She is well known
the members of the ‘student body
through her singing in the church choir.
and social contact through entertainment
in her home, and her absence has been
keenly felt by the Davidson students.

It is very doubtful if Mrs. Vowles will
be singing before at least a month, as
she plans to fully regain her strength be-
fore she takes up her work again.

Work on Year Book
Progressing Slowly

Efforts have recently been magle by the
Quips and Cranks staff to secure pictures
of every man in the student body, but as
yet only three hundred and seventy-five
pictures have been taken. It is probable
that the photographs taken thus far will
be returned some time during the latter
part of February.

The biggest problem now is that of the
senior write-ups; only ten of these articles
having handed in to date. The
enior section comprises one-fourth of the

been

entire annual and the editor has urged that
the seniors co-operate in handing in this
work as soon as possible, in order that
work might be finished before the Christ-

Ten years ago, there were 218 miles of air mail routes with

the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from
Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.

Can you imagine this growth without electricity—without
illuminated airports—without trunk lines studded with
electric beacons?

A majority of the beacon
lights used in airport and
airway illumination have
been designed and manu-
factured by the General
Electric Company, whose
specialists have the benefit
of a generation's experi-
ence in the solution of
lighting problems.

Men of vision are building for increasing traffic of the air.
Soon, the skies will be filled with commerce.

Just as electricity is helping to conquer the air, the land,
and the sea to-day, so to-morrow it will lead to greater
accomplishments in aviation and in every human activity.
