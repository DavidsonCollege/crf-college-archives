OTHER ARTISTS BOOKED

Joseph Brinkman And Wilson
Angel Will Appear

Announcement has been made here of
the three artists who will participate in
Davidson’s 1934-35 concert series. ‘They
are Palmer Christian, organist, Joseph
Brinkman, pianist, and Wilson Angel,
singer.

This announcement of Davidson's first
concert series was’ made by James Chris-
tian Pfohl, director of music. The in-
novation is in line with the general policy
of musical expansion, which has been in
effect since Mr. Pfohl was secured last
year as director of music.

Palmer Christian, known throughout
the United States and Canada as one of
the outstanding contemporary concert or-
ganists, will present the opening concert
of the series on November 6. The
Detroit News stated that, “Palmer Chris-
tian is an artist of sensitive nature, able
to discern the composer's most fragile
and fugitive thoughts and display the
same, crystal clear, to his audience”.
After his last Chicago recital, the Chica-
go Herald and Examiner found that, “he
proved that the organist may exercise
his imagination within the limits of his
instrument and achieve expressions of
beauty that are characteristic and that
cannot be duplicated by either the piano
or the orchestra”, Mr. Christian has
made solo appearances with the Chicago,
Detroit, Rochester, and New York Sym-
phonies, New York Philharmonic Socie-
ty, and Philadelphia Orchestra. At pres-
ent he holds the position of University
Organist and is head of the Organ De-
partment at the Universfty of Michigan,
at Ann Arbor, where he was appointed
a few years ago for the express purpose
ing an annual series of recitals.

Joseph Brinkman, one of America’s
outstanding pianists, will be heard in
February, the exact date to be announced
later. He will play at Davidson just
after an appearance in New York at the
Town Hall.

Wilson Angel, bass, formerly. of Win-
ston-Salem, will appear in a recital dur-
ing the month of April. He was the
winner of the National Atwater-Kent
audition in 1931, and is one of North
Carolina’s most outstanding musicians.

Tt is possible that a symphony orches-
tra will be presented on the series also,
but no definite announcement has
made, regarding this.

All concerts will be presented in the
aiiditorium of Chambers Building, at 8
o'clock. Season tickets will be $2.00 and
$1.00 for students. Admission for single
concerts will be 75 cents and 50 cents
for students.

If this concert series proves success-
ful another will be assured for next year.

Masquers Plan
One Act Plays

Dramatic Group To Make Presen-
tations On Night Of
Oct. 23

The Red and Black Masquers will
offer three one act plays on the night of
October 23, 1934, under the joint direc-
tion of Richardson Hillier, D, I. Her-
ring, and Gordon Wood.

The following plays are to be given
at the time by the Red and Black Mas-
quers: Grandma Pulls a String, Wursel-
Flummery, and Night at an Inn.

Grandma Pulls a String is a comedy.
Its plot centers around the attempt made
by Grandma and Hildegard to encourage
the mutual love of Thorton and Julia.
Since both Hildegard and Grandma have
romantic Victorian idéas about how a
young gentleman should propose, and
their attempts to further the action fre
quite humorous. The cast is as follows:

of fifty thousands pounds, to change his
name to Wurzel-llummery? Two men,
rival M. P's are placed ine this predica-
ment. Crawshaw, the elder of the two,
becomes aware of a will with this proviso
in it, and is jeered at unmercifully by
the younger, Meriton. But when .Meri-
ton himself is placed in the same predica-
ment, his views change.

LOGAL PLAYERG
ERECT NEW SET

Scenery To Be Completed In
Time For First Play

Within the last week the Red and
Black Masquers have secured a room
over the old armory. They plan to use
this room as an experimental laboratory
in which to work on new sets and stag-
ing effects, and an entirely new set has
already been constructed under super-
vision of Dave Herring and Dick Hillier.

This set, which will be used in 4 Night
at an Jan, has been built on a prin¢iple
entirely new to the Davidson stage. /The
fundamental dea which governs thfs in-
novation is that the mind can imagine
reality in a much more delightful and
interesting fashion than reality can be
created. ‘Therefore if the essentials of
a set are suggested then the mind will
imagine the details to perfection. Sym-
bolismy rather than realism has been re-
sorted to.

The interior of an inn has been con-
structed in the following manner: The
pheavy, paneled wainscoating been
erected in its entirety. From it heavy
timbers rise up to the suggested ceiling.
the beams there no wall;
however, the presence of a wall is im-
plied by the windows and doors which
project upward from the waincoating.
Behind the wall is a backdrop colored a
deep sky blue by means of special light-
ing effects which have been worked out
for it. On the backdrop several symbolic
stars will glow fitfully, thus producing
a suggestion of nebulous unreality.

The paneling has been so constructed
that it can also be used interchangeably
with the present “brown” set thereby pro-
viding the possibility of yet another in-
terior.

In addition to work on flats there has

the construction of masks. The
