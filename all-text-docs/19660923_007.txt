SC Foes Awake;

‘Cats In First?

By BOB REID
Assistant Sports Editor
When the smoke cleared Saturday from Southern
Conference gridiron battles, the Wildcat “Dirty Thirty”

emerged as ngs of a jumbled conference hill.
With East Carolina and William and Mary grinding
out a 7-7 tie Saturday, the 'Cats are now the only South-

ern Conference team sporting a victory in the family.

All the experts pegged
East Carolina and William
and Mary to settle the ques-

tion of kingpin of the South-
ern Conference last Satur-
day as the two powerhouses
met in Williamsburg, Va.
But it looked like William
and Mary Coach Marv Levy
forgot to dress out his of-
—, as the indians chalked up only 145 yards on the
attack.

A 95-yard punt return by defensive specialist Chip
Young in the second quarter put the Indians on the score-
board, while ECC halfback Mike Ellis grabbed a punt and
raced 75 yards in the third quarter to even up the ball

game.

Meanwhile, West Virginia managed to give Duke a
few anxious moments before the Blue Devils remembered
they were in a ball game. The Mountaineers took an early
game lead, as end John Mallory snagged a 55-yard scor-
ing pass from quarterback Tom Digon. But the Blue Dev-
ils roared back, as defensive end Bruce Wiesley inter-
cepted a Mountie pass and galloped 21 yards to score.

Fullback Jay Calabrese plowed over the goal line
twice in the second quarter to give Duke a 20-9 lead at
the half. Quarterback Al Woodall and halfback Dave Dun-
away both scored on long runs to make it a blue day for
the Mounties.

Mountie halfback Steve Edwards’ 12 yard TD run in
the third was not enough to save the day, as Duke came
out on top 34-15.

Meanwhile, in Nashville, Tenn., Vanderbilt, peren-
nial joke of the SEC, smashed The Citadel! 24-0 before a
hometown crowd which danced in the aisles, over-joyed
that the Commodores had managed to win a game. Junior
quarterback Gary Davis scored twice from the one and
John Gamble scampered 98 yards on a pass interception
to break the back of little Citadel. A 44-yard field goal by
Fred Klaass rounded out the scoring.

Closer home, Furman fell to strong Parsons 20-6,
while Richmond dropped one to Dayton 28-0. VMI edged}
Villanova 14-13 to round out the conference schedule.

All conference team will see action tomorrow, with
Davidson meeting Furman at Charlotte, The Citadel bat-
tling Richmond, East Carolina hosting Northeast Louisi-
ana, George Washington meeting Virginia Tech, and VMI
committing suicide at Roanoke against Georgia.

West Virginia will host William and Mary to cap the |
conference festivities

ONLY ONE NAME PLAYER

Davidson has played only one game, but the experts
are so thrilled with the ’Cats that one of their number
has been picked to the first all star team of the season.

Jeff Pflugner, 'Cat offensive tackle, rated a starting
center slot on the fourth annual Charlotte News South-
eastern All-Name team along with such “name” players
as Billy Shadnagle of LSU, Gusty Yearout of Auburn and
Haven Kicklighter of Georgia Tech. :

In announcing his selections, News sports editor Ron-
ald Green said: “Some are born stars, some achieve star-
dom thrust upon them .. . the man with the right name
can emerge from the crowd .. . It must, by all means, be
unusual.” :

Davidson can be proud of its first student-athlete
to win All-Southeastern honors this year. Could this be
our first All-American? :

In other honors won by Wildcats, Jimmy Poole was
named Back of the Week by The Charlotte and
was named Associated Press Back of the Week in the
Southern Conference.

Pete Glidewell was cg sary AP conference Line-
man of the Week behind Don Taylor of VMI. Winning

Four Best Hands on the Team

Glidewell Catches Record

BY DALE DURHAM
Sports Writer

“It was a tremendous thrill,” end Pete Glidewell said after breaking the school
record for most passes received in a single game Saturday against George Washing-| According to figures from Da
ton. “I didn’t realize how many passes I had caught until the game was over.”

Glidewell, who played his first
game at end Saturday, hauled
down nine passes from quarter-
back Jimmy Poole to break the
old record of seven set last year
by Bill Rikard.

“I wasn’t surprised at the vic
tory,’’ Glidewell said. *‘The team
was trained hard and was phys
ically and emotionally ready.
Now that we've won a game, we
have a more optimistic outlook

for the season.”

Glidewell, a 20-year old jun-
ior from Reidsville, was moved
to his tight end slot from half-
back this year, to take advan-
tage of what Coach Homer Smith
calls his ‘‘exceptional pass
catching ability." Last season
he racked up more than 100
yards in a single game against
Wofford,

do better this year than last.

“We have better prospects,”
this year,” said Whittle. “Barry

Lowrance, Colin Hudson, Jim
Wall, Bill Hearn, John Morse
and Ed Van Deman all are look

Morse is the only returning
letterman from last year's team

which finished low in the confer-
ence, recording only one victory,
a 21-34 defeat of High Point Col
lege. This year, Whittle said,
Davidson is pre-ranked fifth in
the Southern Conference.

The harriers will launch their
season Oct. 5 when they battle
the Wake Forest thinclads at
Winston-Salem. Whittle said that
neither team is expected to be in
“prime shape.”

which consisted of the standing
broad jump, dips, bar snap, 100
yard dash, softball throw and
football punt.

One freshman, ho asked to
remain anonymous, said, ‘I feel
that our class as a whole might
be composed of a little too much
intellect and not enough phys-
ical training—possibly due to the

increased academic standards
here.”
Sophomore Tom Baker, who

served as a starter for the 100
yard dash, ventured his op:nion.
“The freshman ‘class,”’ he said,

“has its share of the outstand-
ing athletes, but it’s somewhat
out of proportion beyond that,
with more than normal of the
uhathletic type.”

The class of 1970 averaged
302.07 points per man for the
test, scoring a total of 72,798.8
points.

Those who failed to pass the
minimum standard of 290 points
are required to remain in a fun-
damentals class for the first
quarter or until they can im-
prove their score to 290 or bet-
ter.
