The Thin Skin Line

Another tournament, another Bulova wrist waleh.
Thie seems to be what the Southern Conference tour-
nament has evolved into for the Davidson basketball
plaver. We blitzed our way through thig year's three
games even more forcefully than we did lost season.

Last wesk everyone seemed to conschously con
trol their prezs statements so that it appeared any SC
team could knock Davidson off in the tourney. No one
wanted to speak the evident truth. After demolishing
Richmond for our second victory, Huckel told me he
was petting sick of hearing the repeated line that we
weren't that much better than our SC opponents.
‘We'ra supposed to beat everyone badly and that’s
what we'll do,” answered Huckel when asked if he
were worrying about Bast Carolina.

in addition to the fina] scores, I enter as evidence
io our sirong control of tie tourney the fact that
the Davidson skins played in every gamc. Everyone
knows the opposing teams can't be too good if the
skin team gets to play. East Carolina Coach Tom
Quinn complained that all he read about in Charlotte
was how good Davidson was. After the game Satur-
day, a sports writer told me that was all Quinn could
talk about. Just for wearing horrible-looking purple
and white striped warmups, the Pirates should have
lost on general principles.

The Wildcat club used the awards ceremony
after the last game as an opportunity to give Lefty
a new Thunderbird automobile. This was the first
of several moves ta keep Lefty at Davidson. Your
guess about what he’s going to do is as good as mine.
As my evident skin status discloses, ] never have been
able to figure him out.

He could get in his T-Bird and drive all the way
to College Park or he could stay and win the national
champlonship next year. Whatever, I asked him after
the game if I could drive his new car. He kind of
shock his head and made some comment about the
fact that skins don’t drive new cars. Maybe I can ride
with Dave or Doug at the wheel.

As far as I was concerned the all-tournament
team should have been the Davidson starting five.
Doug, Jerry, and Mike were put on the first team
while Dave and Wayne made the second five. This
compliments the all-conference team released a week
before which had Jerry and Mike on the first team
and Dave and Doug on the second. It's my belief that
possibly only two or three other players in the con-
ference would have a chance to start on Davidson's
team,

With tha allaverything releases that have come
out lately, I have selected the annual all-conference
skin team for the 1968-69 season. There were many
candidates in that there are always more skins around
than shirts, but 1 believe I have weighed all the evi-
dence fairly and come up with a viable crew, Several
players who looked like pre season picks lost out be-
cause they tried too hard, but better luck next year,

At the guard position J] chose East Carolina's
Rickie Williams and our own Tony Orsbon, who in-
cidentally is a repeat choice from last year's all-SC
skin team. Willianas is listed in the program at 6-2,

170 pounds but actually weighs close to 195. He's |

losing his hair but this doesn’t seem to affect
his weight. He also has a tatoo on his left shoulder
whieh savs “Mom.” This alone quabfed him for the
honor. Tony- made the team easily, With his sheoting
ercentage dropping from a mark of four-for-four
ast yeat to bwo-for-11 this vear, he took the honor
in a breeze.

At the forward position 1 found two deserving
candidates, Den James of Furman and Richmond's
Ed Surgan. After the all-skin team came out last year,
Don must have been truly unhappy because after start-
ing all last season for the Paladins, he worked hard
tnfs year and only got into eight games that J know
about. That's what I cal] a real skin comeback,

Surgan is Usted in the Richmond program as a
forward but this is where he fools everyone including
himself because he plays the guard position during
games. What cinched his selection was during the
last seconds of our game with Richmond, when J was
standing at the foul line minding my own business.
He told me, “You really think you're tough, don't
you?” I said, “No, but Ive got a friand by the name
of Steve Kirley who thinks he is.” You just don't ask 3
skin if he thinks he’s tough.

This year the center position was awarded to
Walt Ivkovich of VMI. Known as “Iky” to his friends,
Walt is one of the nicest guys you'll find on the
court. In our game with VMI, he fell down after going
for a rebound and hit his head, lost his glasses, cut
his knee, and skinned his elbow. He got right up and
apologized to Doug and Mike for hitting them with
his arm on the way down. Iky hulls front Aliquippa,
Pa.. and only being a junior, he hows real promise
a8 a Tepeat performer.

Furman’s Charles Selvy deserves an honorable
mention award, Allhaugh a starter for the Paladins
he pulled a true skin move in Furmon's last game
with Richmond. With 21 seconds [aft and the score
fied, he dribbled back vonrt and Richmosd got the
Dall and seored to win the game, Charles just might
make it next year.

Coach Churtes Parker
draws 4 ulstinclian between
minor and non subsidined
aports. “You don't have any
minur sports here, only non-
subsidized ones.”

Parker secs several pros
blems in the wrestling pro-
gram at Davidson, but funds
for equipment ate not among
them,

‘We have enough amoney
for expenses, we are a well
eguiped team. Our facilities
are fine, but we do need a
new mal which I've been ts-
ing to get for several years.
Ti gets cut from the budget
overy year.”

The most seriaus problem
facing the team is personnel.

“We don't have a recruit:
ing budget here und that
prevents us (rum attracting
seate of the top high school
wrestlers to Davidson,” Par-
kor said. “I've never asked
for a recruiting budget but
we are going to need one
soon to keep up.”

Since there are no wrest-
jing scholarships, Parker
polnts out that he has no
bold on the wrestlers who
do come on their own. “It's
a lot of hard work and it
lakes dedication to be a
wreatiing. When a boy pets:
here he finds a lot of other
things to do. If youre sot

“Right now on lbhis cpm.
