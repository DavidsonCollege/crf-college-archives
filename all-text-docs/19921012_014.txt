yard Fassett field goal kept the
Wildcats fairly close, but Davidson
simply could not regain enough
momentum to pose a serious threat.

Kevin Holzworth and Howell
shared the quarterbacking duties
for Davidson, passing for a com-
bined 152 yards and rushing for
another 112. Mike Wright rushed
fifteen times for a hard-earned
forty-three yards, and Dan Lamar
caught six passes for 65 yards. The
three turnovers, however, signifi-

chances.

“Going into today’s game, we
felt these two teams were evenly
matched, with us at 1-3 and Wash-
ington and Lee at 1-2,” Davidson
coach Dave Fagg said. ““We found
out, however, that we were not.
They beatus in every way possible
- offensively, defensively, and on
special teams.” Davidson’s record
now stands at 1-4, and the Wild-
cats must regroup and prepare to
meet Methodist next Saturday in

Soccer

Continued from page 16

Cougars, like the ‘Cats, try to push the ball up the field ina hurry, and look
to a big gun for scoring. The big gun, junior Clay Smith, had tallied 20
points in his first ten games. Alas, the offensive fireworks didn’t
materialize, especially for Charleston. The Davidson defense, led by
Omli and Tommy Suter, held Smith and his mates in check, and the ‘Cats
used second half goals from Lance Kinerk and Ukrop to win 2-0.
After a scoreless first half, Cof C put nearly continuous pressure on
the Davidson goal for several minutes early in the second half. But Alex
Deegan had all the answers for the ‘Cats in goal, including a marvelous

a goal.

With under 30 minutes to play, the momentum changed hands.
Davidson nearly scored on a pretty cross from Ukrop to Ben Hayes, and
then found the net in an unlikely manner. Stopper Lance Kinerk blasted
the ball from the right side of the field about 35 yards out, “pretty much,”
as he put it, “trying to put it on goal,” and ended up beating the keeper
with it. |
Ukrop, after a number of missed scoring opportunities, got the
insurance goal (14, 59) on a feed from Sampers with 2:04 to play.

The Cougars (6-4-1) boasted a win over #25 William and Mary y

(which tied UCLA) and a tie with #12 Furman, and Slagle was under-
standably happy to get a quality win. “These are the kind of teams we’ ve
got to beat to have a chance for a[n NCAA] bid,” he said.

Hankins /

Continued from page 16

Hundley believes Hankins’
continued success hinges on ad-
justing mentally to her early-sea-
son point total. “I don’t think she’s
really got a scorer’s mentality, but
somebody’s got to be in the right
place to score goals, and they keep
track of things like that,” he noted.

Though she has proven to bea
dominant force early in her
Davidson career, Hankins contin-
ues to place the team ahead of
personal glory. “The rankings are
nice, but the team winning is more
important,” she said.
