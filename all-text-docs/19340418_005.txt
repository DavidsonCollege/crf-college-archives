First Founders Day
Pronouced Success

Davidson's first Founders’ Day, cele-
brated last Thursday, proved a large
success from every point of view. The
day was set aside by the trustees to
commemorate the ninety-seventh anni-
versary of the founding of the college,
and students, faculty, alumni and
friends of the institution joined in the
celebration.

The principal address of the day was
made by Dr. Ben E. Geer, president
of Furman University, who was intro-
duced by President Walter L. Lingle.
The Furman president, who was until
recently a textile executive, pointed to
the past of Davidson, and then turned
to the future. He discussed the posi-
tion of the church school in the edu-
cational system of today, and pointed
out the fact that there is a definite
need for schools of the type of Fur-
man and Davidson.

Dr. J. M. McConnell, dean of the
faculty and professor of history, brief-
ly traced the splendid history of the
institution.

The band ‘concert, which was held
in the Chambers. Building because of
the cold weather,and the baseball
game with Duke, which Davidson won,
climaxed the day’s events at the col-
lege.

Alumni meetings in many southern
cities rounded out the Founders’ Day
celebration. Large crowds and a great
deal of interest were reported by the
representatives of the college who at-
tended the meetings.

Dr. Walter Lingle, commenting on
the day’s activities, said that the day
would likely become a permanent fea-
ture of the college program, and that
the Foundérs’ Day in 1937, when the
college will be 100 years old would be
a particularly large event.
