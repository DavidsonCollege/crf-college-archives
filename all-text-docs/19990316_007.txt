Women’s Month: Not just for women

By ANNE STANCIL
Student Health Advisor

If you have walked through Chambers, the
Union, or a dormitory, you have probably noticed
posters and bulletin boards advertising the activi-
ties for Women’s Month. “Women’s ‘Month?”
you might ask. “What is Women’s Month?” Or,
if you are a man you might ask, “Do I need to mark
this on my-calender?”

The Student Health Advisors want to encour-
age both men and women to attend the events this
month. We have watched movies, heard music
and had discussions, activities which will continue
all month. We stress the importance of participa-
tion from both genders, and not just women. A few
weeks ago different groups sponsored programs
on eating disorders for both men and women and
the response was encouraging. By engaging in
open dialogue, we begin to see that many issues,
suchas rape, sexuality, and body image affect both
sexes.

As a health advisor I am naturally concerned
with the overall heath and well-being of the cam-
pus. I have written articles discussing physical
health issues such as AIDS and the hazards of
alcohol. Now I am concerned with emotional
health as well. A good relationship with members
of the opposite sex is important to mental health.

Weare not speaking, necessarily, of sexual or

romantic relations, but genuine friendships and
acquaintances. Like all healthy relationships, com-
munication betweenhe two parties is important.
Communication between men and women is some-
times difficult due to inherent differences in thought
process of males and females. These differences
should only encourage us to increase communica-
tion and overcome our differences. I have had
several conversations about this issue with friends
of both genders, and many have expressed their
frustration with the interaction between men and
women at Davidson. The frustration saddens me.

Here we are, the smartest in the country,
assembled in one place and we cannot relate to one
another. We work abstract math problems and
discuss complicated novels, but we have trouble
communicating with the other gender. Why? Are
we letting these differences become too over-
whelming? Let’s all vow to change our ways and
make strides toward better communication. Hu-
mans naturally gravitate toward what is comfort-
able and familiar, but let’s take the opportunities
this month and leave our comfort zones, If you are
a man, go to the discussions about international
reproductive rights or sexuality. If you are a
woman, go to these events too, and take a male
friend along with you. Women’s Month presents
both men and women with the opportunity to open
the lines of communication and get to know our-
selves and each other better.

Maxwell’s
House of Style

By Peter Gross

I wish I were cool. I
have no rhythm, I have no
talent; I don’t have “‘it,”
whatever “it” is. I- guess
that’s why I gravitate to-
ward people who do. That’s
probably also why I enjoy
listening to musicians who
-have that intangible element
about them. . . that touch of
flair in their work that re-
minds me why I love music.
R&B specialist Maxwell is
such an artist — confident,
yet graceful; chic, yet un-
pretentious; rough-edged,
yet silky smooth. I first saw
him perform on a VHI spe-
cial a yearago. Eventhough
I had never heard of him, I
was fascinated. His voice
was impeccably pure, while, his songs had a
Hendrix-like hypnotic feel to them.

It was a relatively easy choice, therefore, to

Though the everyday Boyz IT Men and Janet
Jackson listener may not appreciate what Maxwell
has accomplished with Embrya, I do encourage
the discerning enthusiast to give hima try — whether
a fan of R&B or not. At the very least, in listening
to the album you might understand my favorite

part of it - when I listen with my eyes closed, and
get drowned in Maxwell’s velvet-smoothness, if I
concentrate really hard . . . for a brief second, I
know what it’s like to be cool. And, well, that’s
reason enough for me.
