--College selects class of 1993-

Initial pool shrinks from last year

By GARY WHEELER

Thecollege admissions staff has
mailed its acceptance letters for
the class of 1993. The average
accepted applicant was ranked in
the top three percent of his/her
class and scored a 1280 on the
SAT. Seventy-five of the 694

applicants accepted were valedic-
ai

This year’s initial pool of 2084
applicants is actually smaller than
Jast year’s figure of 2270, but
Davidson is not the only school to
‘see a drop in applications. The
‘Wall Street Journal reported that
applications were down five to
twenty percent at many of the na-
tion’s competitive colleges and
universities. The article’s title best
_ describes how colleges have been
handling the situation: “With

ies between schools, but many are

plicants, Davidson included.
According to admissions coun-

selor Mark Swift, the number of

accepted applicants is slightly
larger than last year, but next

Last year 664 acceptances were
made. The class of 1993 is ex-
pected to have 385 students, about
54 percent male and 46 percent
female. Swift also anticipates that
“less people will be taken from the
waiting list.”

This year marks the first time
that not all regular decision letters
were mailed on the same. day.

Gardner says that anxious par-
ents and students often call and
ask,”’Can’t you let me know?’”
Gardner feels that once a decision
has been reached “there is no rea-
son why we can’t let them know.”
He says that the new policy has

~ While the admissions staff has

cants have yet to decide whether
they will enroll at Davidson or go
elsewhere. With this provision in

mind, Gardner says that in aca- .

demics, leadership, performing

“could be the best ever.” _

AIDS PANEL, from page 1

stressed the position that “‘all are
frail, all will fall and all need
mercy.”

Murphy also strongly supports
making condoms available on
campus. “My first reaction is, I
can’t imagine that this is an issue.”

Miller was the only member of
the panel who represented the
opposing viewpoint. “I believe the
institutionalization of condom
machines goes against [Davidson]
values,” Miller stated. According
to him, to installing these ma-
chines would be “acquiescing to
students who are not living up to
certain standard.”

Eaton remained somewhat non-
committal in her opinion. “We [the
infirmary] have no say in policy
making,” she noted.

Lindsey moderated the ques-

tion-and-answer that fol-
lowed these statements, . Questions
discussed included: “ the
presence of condoms make it

harder to say no to sex?”’; “Is absti-
nence an option?”; “Do condom
machines condone or encourage
sex?”

Freshman Kim Gaillard said, “I
don’t think seeing a condom
makes you want to say yes to sex
anyway.”

Cole agreed, adding, “People
who are going to have sex are
going to have sex whether there is
acondom machine there or not.”

Miller, however, argued that “I
don’t think the presence of a con-
dom machine makes it easy to no,”
especially in cases where alcohol
is involved.

Walters said that she and three
other members Davidson students
had recently attended an AIDS
Education Forum. “Weare all very

intent on education as the prime

goal,” she said. She stressed the
Human Resources Committee’s
goal of “trying to surpass. this
condom controversy and get to the
real health issue.”

Abstaining from sex is “a posi-
tive choice for people,” said Jen-

Ardy:

Religion professor Trent Foley, mem r of the AIDS. discussion past acknowledged that sex is prevalent on
campus. “I think there are more Davidson students who would rather admit to an honor offense than to admit

nings. He also recognized, how-
ever, “It’s easy to succumb to the
pressure” to have sex.

“I’m all for abstinence, too. .’.
but I’m a realist,” said Cole. He
added that those who advocate
abstinence as a cure-all are look-
ing at the situation “in more ideal-
istic terms.”

Foley acknowledged that s sex is
prevalent on campus. “I think
there are more Davidson students
who would rather admit to an
honor offense than to admit they
left Davidson a virgin.”

Student Government Associa-
tion President Tripp Helms noted
that 72% of the students surveyed
favored condom machines on
campus. He said that an SGA
committee is being formed to dis-
cuss the issue and then make a
recommendation to the college
president.

Helms stated that the SGA
wishes. to avoid the “infamous
truck-stop image” that some stu-
dents think condom machines
would confer.

John Freeman, '89, a member of the newly formed Global Issues
Research Group, recently led a discussion on South Africa at the
group's weekly meeting. Supported by the Dean Rusk Program,
the group will focus upon a different topic each year in an effort to
raise student awareness and to share viewpoints. Everyone is
invited to a planning session this Thursday, Apr. 27, at 9:45 p.m.

Alumni weekend

Events included freshman cakewalk
“rerun” for ambitious alumni

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

Over 800 alumni, plus their
spouses and guests, made the trek
to Davidson this past Friday for a
huge reunion weekend.

The alumni office had been or-
ganizing Alumni Weekend since
January. Each class had a reunion
committee responsible for plan-
ning individual class events, as
well as sending out fliers to urge
classmates to attend the reunion.

Assistant to the Director of
Alumni Relations Bill Young pre-
dicted a record alumni turnout.
“More people are coming back
this year because we have an ex-
tensive program,” he said. “We’ve
added lectures by President
Kuykendall, a campus bus tour
and a rerunning of the freshman
cake race for the spirited alum-
nus.”

Young was also in charge of
planning alumni housing and
parking. Most classes have a
“class hotel” assigned to their
year. This enabled individuals to
meet for parties and independ-
ently-pianned functions. Young
mentioned parking as a likely
problem and contracted for several
shuttle-buses. to run between
Davidson and the hotels.

_ Additional activities this year
increased the need for student vol-
unteers. Young sent fliers out to

* lastyear’s volunteers in an attempt

to recruit students.
Healsospoke toall presidents of
Patterson Court houses concern-
ing a house competition to in-
crease volunteer participation.
The house that recruited the most
volunteers will receive a pizza

party, complements of the alumni
office. Spencer House President
M. K. Myatt said she volunteered
last year because “it’s a good way
to show that we care enough about
Davidson to give some of our
time.”

Volunteers usually worked two-
hour shifts during the weekend.
The alumni office asked them to
bartend, host or help set up sdme of
the many dinner functions. Some
students simply were asked to talk
to alumni and give them an im-
pression of Davidson. “The stu-
dents act as sounding boards for
Davidson today,” said Young.

The weekend offered volunteers
the: opportunity to learn what
Davidson was like in the past. It
also gave them a chance to talk
about the world outside Davidson.

Senior Valerie Graves handed
out name tags ata 50th reunion last
year. “The people were really
funny and friendly,” she said. “It
was good to see people come back
to see each other. I felt a kinship
with them because they wentto .
Davidson and someday I’ll have
the same experience.”
