that made the spectator wonder if he had-moved
about five hundred feet or so from the pla¥ing
field, or whether he should rush out and get his
bi-focals checked. The tiny teams slugged it out
viciously for some ten or fifteeh minutes with the
Concord sporters coming out on top by a 6-0 score.
The tally came just before closing’ time, when
a Concord back snagged a pass and raced 25 yards
for paydirt.
B TEAM
Davidson College’s Wildkittens dropped their first
game of the season Saturday night in Concord to an
evasive Concord High School team. Starting strong the
Kittens were quick to-draw blood, scoring early. in the
first half when Charlie Miller*raced off left tackle, 60
yards for a TD. But the Concorders were still in the
fray. Taking to the air, they completed beautiful passes,
and Davidson was again in the hole because of a lack of
pass defense. The Kittens attack was hindred: by many
fumbles, but they consistantly gained through the line.
—Elkin,;—Bingham,—Prior, Watt, Miller and little Dave
Erwin played their usual fine brand of ball, but the Con-
cord passes were too much for the’Cats and the game
ended in,;a 13-7 victory for the high schoolers.
CAGERS
Coach Norman Shepard’s cagers are whipping
themselves into shape in rapid fashion and Coach
Sheppard says his material this year “looks very
good”. ‘A list of the squad as it stands this week,
with letter men in the first group is as follows:
J. D. Ashmore, Bob Berry, Bob Flowers, Bill
Hodgin, Freeman Jones, Bob Manor, George
Peters, Ed White,. Mike Williams; Haywood
Brinegar, Bob Carson, Jim Cobb, Whit Cobb,
Malcom Earp, Tim Hardin, Dick Mills, Henry
Neisler, Bo Roddy, Bob Stephens, Bub Wilcox,
Jack Burris, and Gabby Bryant. Included in the
present schedule for the coming year are: two
games with Duke, two with N. C., two with N. C.
State, two with Clemson, two with U.S.C., two
with Furman, two with Citadel, two with Wof-
ford, and a single contest with Ga. Tech.
ARMY-NOTRE DAME
The greatest game of the last week was without a
doubt the flashy conflict between unbeaten Army and
unbeaten Notre Dame. The Irish met the situation with
grace and power and for the first time in 25 games
mighty Army trembled a bit and the touchdown twins
were not quite so sure of themselves. Johnny Lujack,
after nation wide publicity concerning his ankle mishap,
turned up in good shape, passing, running and punting
with All-American quality. Arnold Tucker showed again
that maybe a wee bit too much glory has been going to
Blanchard and: Davis for in the tight spots it was Tucker
who came through playing calm and brilliant ball. And
so the nations two mightiest. team fought to a ‘0-0 tie,

for first in National rating.

Story Prepares For
Citadel And Furman

Coach Bill’Story had his crippled

squad hard at work this week after
being drubbed the last two weeks

by. Washington and Lee and Rich-
mond. The red and black has its
eye on salvaging the last two con-
tests of this most torrid of all pig-
skin seasons. By taking the measure
of The Citadel and Furman, the
Cats can top the .500 mark and
will have a couple of wins to boast
in the Southern Conference. De-
spite one-sided scores over Erskine,
Wofford, and Hampden-Sydney,
the freshman dominated Wildcats
have yet to crack the win column
in family competition.

No New Injuries

No more injuries were reported
after the contest with Richmond
and, barring mishaps in the next
two weeks of practice;-The Citadel
should face a Davidson team af full
strength except for ‘guard Bill
Boyd who has been lost for the
season. The Cat hefties, namely,
Ed Rhodes, Ernie Stricklin, Bob
Sharpe, and Bob Strickland will be
ready to go. Story also was well
pleased with tackle play of Carl
Eborn and said that the big boy
would stay at the spot where he
gained All-Southern fame in high
school.

Sandy Carnegie will be back at
the pivot post after a sterling per-
formance against the Spiders at
tackle. However, he will have to
scrap to take the spot back from
17-year-old Johnny Richards, who
was a thorn in the side of Rich-
mond pass snatchers all afternoon.
Richards along with Eborn drew
Coach Story’s highest praise for
their play.

Backs Look Good

Carl Pahl and Mac Erwin were
highly acclaimed for their crushing
line smashes. Jim Sifford and Doug
Rice showed some clean heels” to
the Spider lineman. Sifford dis-
played more drive than he hag in
past games and this coupled with
his speed should make him a first
class ovel toter. Rice, a 153-pound
scat back, proved decisively that
he was one of. Story’s fastest backs,
and, in scoring the lone Cat tally,
showed the shiftiness of a true

Future 'Cat Prospects Bright

The Richmond game, which was
a criterion for future Cat teams,
proved that the old grads will have
something to spout about in the
next few years. In building his
Squad around only three veterans,
Coach Story has pulled something
of a grid masterpiece. In the next

K.A’s Still In First Place

As Interfrat

Going into the last week of inter;
frat ball, the K. A.s clinched the
first place slot by a win over the
S. P. E.s Jast Monday. The only
possible blight on their record is
that they may have to be satisfied
with a tie with the Phi Delts for
the choice But, having
two games still to play, the big gold
team has to take only one of them

position.

to hold the top slot with no strings
attached. These two games are
with the S. A. E.s and the Kappa
Sigs, the latter a play-off.

Also last Monday, two teams fin-
ished out their schedule. The Phi
Gams downed the Betas to keep
hold of the third place slot. They
ended up the season with 6 wins
and At the same time,
the Betas, coming out the under-
dog in the tight game, hold 4 win:
and 5 losses, It was a pretty tough
pill for the sons of Wooglin, for
they lost their last three games.

The S. A. E.s came up the lad-
der a couple of notches this past
week, winning two games, one a
14-0 win over the Betas, and the
other a bare 6-0 win over the In-
dependents. They hold a chance
of tieing in third place~ with the
Phi Gams. In the same position
also are the Kappa Sigs, who have
four wins and three losses. But
both the teams may see that hope
wrecked in forthcoming tilts with
the K.A.s.

3 losses.

Also last week, the two cellar
teams battled on the gridiron, and
it found the Independents coming
out on the long end of 2 first down
to one win.

When this sheet comes out, the
truth will in all probability be
known, but for those who want to
see how it was done, as well as for
the more uninformed, we forthwith
publish the weekly scoreboard.

RICHMOND; TEAM TOO
POWERFUL

Davidson College tasted defeat
again last Saturday on Richardson
Field at the hands of Richmond
University, 27-6. Greatly crippled
and facing a super-charged Spider
team, the Wildcats could break
through for only one score, late
in the game, when after a sustained
19 yard drive to the Richmond 11
in the last quarter, Doug Rice, 153-
pound wingback, scooted over on a
reverse,

Despite the absence of tackles
and guards, the Wildcats opened up
in the first quarter with a rolling
offensive, demonstrating some of
the best ball played by the club
thus far. Sparked by Erwin and
Sifford they drove to the Richmond
20-yard line, but took to the air
and had their second pass inter-
cepted by Wilbourne, Rich-
mond back.

T-Formation

From here out it was Richmond
all the way except for the Wildeats’
scoring drive in the last quarter.
The Spiders’ T worked like a
charm with Wilbourne, Tom Bil-
lingsley and Charlie Suttenfield
running like race horses. One par-
ticular Spider play spiked the scor-
ing punch, a play whereby the man
under the center took the ball,
started either the right or left,
then handed off behind him to a
halfback who came barreling into
the line at top speed. Wilbourne
scored the first two TDs on that
play. Billingsley scored the ‘third
on a lateral from Fenlon from
seven yards out, and Walt Bolen
passed 85 yards to Bob Johnson
on the ten who then carried over
for the fourth Spider-score. ;

With heavy injuries along the
tackle and guard. front, switches
had to be made, placing Eborn and
Carnegie at tackle to compensate
for the injured Stricklin and
Rhodes. Carnegie, former .center
and Eborn, former gnd not only
made the best of thé situation but
played their best game of the year.
Coach Story said Eborn was great
last Saturday, and “I am going to
leave him at tackle from, now on.
