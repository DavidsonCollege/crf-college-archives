PANDEINIC SOCIETY PICKS
NAME AND PRESSES AHEAD

The new Pandeinic “Literary Society
held its usual-meeting on January 12th.
Several interesting features marked this
meeting.

The first of these was the choosing of
the name, Pandeinic, which means all-
skillful.

R. R. McIlwaine opened the program
with an enlightening oration on the sub-
ject of “Memory.” Then the arguments
of W. H. Moore and V. C. Hoye were
pitted in debate against those of W. T.
Baker and H, L. Currie. Their subject
was, “The Government Ownership of
Mines.” The next interesting «feature
was the presentation of Current Events
by W. W. Moore: D. B. Walthall then
gave a very good declamation, “John
Adams on the Revolutionary War.”

The whole program was a very inter-
esting one. The next meeting of the
*andeinics will be held on February 2d,
to give time for study on exams and re-
All Freshmen who expect to
join the new society are to give their
names to Coach Moore.

METROPHILIAN SPEAKERS
‘FLARE FORTH ELOQUENTLY

views.

‘At the last meeting of the Metrophil-
ian Society the query for debate was,
“Resolved, That the Federal Government
should own and operate the coal mines,
United States constitutionality waived.”
W. G. Thomas and W. H. Matheson
proved, for the affirmative, the advant-
age of having the government own and
operate such a vital factor in American
industry as the coal mines. P, C. Hen-
derson and Guiton upheld the negative.

Following the debates, A. C Ray gave
a declamation on “The Training Camp
of the Future,” and R. P. Brown an ora-
tion on “The Average College Student
of Today.”

The society is planning a mock trial
for Thursday, the roth. A Mr. McIver
is the defendant, charged with man-
slaughter caused by his reckless driv-
ing. Regular court procedure will take
place.

enjoyed by the Eumeneans’ last Thurs-
day night.’ “A heated ‘oratorical contest
ciisuéd, the subject of the debate being,
“Resolved, That the Government Should
Own and Operate the Coal Mines.” The
affirmative was supported by Elliott, Ted
Jones and Gus Summers, while the nega-
tive was argued by Sharpe, Luckie, and
Henry Morris. The affirmative won by
unanimous vote of the judges, while the
house voted negative on the merits of
the question.

Following the debate, D. B. Walthall
favored the house with a declamation,
and D. L. Mahood delivered a very ‘inter-
esting and educational oration on
“Washington,” paying a noble tribute to
our capital city.

ean and Pandeinic Societies for the Ju-
nior-Senior debate, held in the Eu, hall

aminations on a practically new pro-
gram.

An extensive trip to some of our lead-

MILITARY LABORATORY
IS SET UP BY
R. O. T. C. MEN

A military laboratory has been set up
in one of the large rooms in the gymnas-
ium. This will be open from time to
time for public inspection, The military
instructors have placed there several of
the infantry weapons with large charts
explaining the parts and their use. Maps
on paper, tactical maps in relief and
terrain constructed on the sand table are
to be seen, There are otier things that
would make a visit to this room well
worth one’s time.

In practical work much is being ac-
complished. The Seniors are making
military sketches of a part of the golf
course. A small piece of terrain is being
thoroughly covered, to master the fine
points of sketching.

The Juniors and Sophomores are do-
ing the most warlike work, The Juniors
are learning by actual practice the art
ot placing machine guns, They are plac-
ing them not only in emplacements on
ground but,also in nests in trees. Then
the guns are being camouflaged. Wire
entanglements, obstacles, and revert-
ment models have been constructed.

The Browning automatic rifle is the
subject of the Sophomore work at pres-
ent. The use, name and place of every
part is being taught with the actual rifle
in the hands of the students. They are
acquainted with the shape, size and place
of every piece ordinarily taken apart,
away from the factory. The tactical use,
range and kinds of fire are also being
taught.

The Freshmen are being thoroughly
instructed in close order drill by com-
panies on two days and battalion close
order drill one day each week.

CHRISTIAN

ACTIVITIES

CHINA IS SUBJECT THIS WEEK
IN MISSION STUDY '

China was the topic for.discussion this
week in the mission study classes. All
of the stations and workers in each were
studied Wednesday night. The study
was especially interesting because of the
part that China has been playing in
world affairs and of her present posi-
tion in the political and social world.

Thus far twenty classes have been
formed. Classes off the campus are be-
ing formed at ‘the following places:
Louisiana, Cranford’s, Proctor’s, Smith’s,
Brady’s, White’s, and the Hotel.

Hereafter the leaders’ meeting will be
held-at 9:30 o’clock on Monday nights,
instead of 7:30 o'clock.

Next week’s study will be centered on

Korea and should prove to be equally
as interesting as the present week's
study. Because of her position and his-
torical growth Korea has been fittingly
called the Ireland of China, Japan’s
growth. and civilization has been largely
due to the influence of little Korea. De-
spite this fact, however, “Korea ‘must
have the helping hand of Christianity.

SOME FACTS ABOUT CHINA
ARE GIVEN BY R. BITZER

The Chinese constitute the largest
homogeneous mass in the world’s his-
tory, numbering more than one-fourth of
the population of the globe. They oc-
cupy, next to Russia; the largest con-
tiguous territory in the world.

More than this, China is growing at
such a rate that by the end of the cen-
tury she will probably have eight hun-
dred million inhahitants instead of her
present four hundred and twenty-seven
million. The Chinese are emigrating by
the millions each year into Manchuria,
Malaysia, and other adjacent countries.

China has, with the possible exception
of Africa, the largest undeveloped nat-
ural resources in the world. She has
hard and soft coal in every province, yet
138 Chinese use only as much coal as is
used to supply one American in a year.
The Yangtse-Kiang (where the Southern
Presbyterian missionaries are) has as
great potential. water-power as the Mis-
sissippi and all the rivers of the Atlantic
seaboard. combined—From the Inter-

talks on any Subject started, and many
of them showed real thought and inter-
est in the band.

Last of all, it was decided by a unani-
mous vote that everybody would call
everybody else in the band by their first
names.

VOLUNTEER BAND MEMBERS
“HEAR DEPUTATION
REPORTS

The Volunteers had a good number
present and a varied and interesting
program was presented at their Sunday
morning meeting. Wildman, the leader
meeting, conducted the devo-
tional exercises. He used Paul’s words,
“Let us not be weary in well doing, for
in due season we shall reap if we faint
not.” He told of the helpfulness of
keeping these words in mind when one’s
work becomes discouraging and every-
thing seems going wrong. The foreign
work must needs be disappointing at
times and he urged the use of prayer and
God’s Word as a means toward keeping
a bright outlook on life.

J. C. Wool made a talk on Hangchow
Christian College in China. It was pack-
ed full of valuable thoughts and con-
tained some fine points in favor of Chris-
tian education in heathen lands. He told
of the immediate need of several college
graduates to go to this college for three
years with the opportunity of continuing
there if the work proved appealing.

Coach Moore told of a deputation he
made with Dwight Chalmers to Char-
lotte Friday and he was very enthusi-
astic over this means of presenting the
foreign field to young people in high
schools. Rolston Bitzer told of a simi-
lar deputation to Concord last week.
Moss had a number of pamphlets deal-
ing with different subjects of Christian
wotk which proved interesting to those
who looked them over.

It was announced that at the meetings
every Sunday morning the program
would include that. foreign country
which was being studied in the weekly
mission classes conducted in the dormi-
tories by the “Y” leaders, and that this
service, at 10 o’clock, would: be an open
one to all interested in such studies.
