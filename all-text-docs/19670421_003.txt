Visiting Artist Urges Belief, Honesty

By HERB JACKSON
Editorial Correspondent
The goal of the artist is to
create a work in which he can

ce all

believe, and then being not
quite satisfied, move on to the
next problem. according to
Maud Gatewood.

MAUD GATEWOOD
“Guided By Integrity, | Continue”

Monday. Miss Gatewood de-
livered a lecture at noon on
“The ‘Significance of Certain
Painters." In the afternoon
she held a critical session in
the art studio, warning stu-
dents to be aware of their in-
fluences.

Questions such as the mean-
ing of art were raised, to
which Miss Gatewood replied.
“There is a point at which you
do not wish to find all the an-
swers, to classify or categor-
ize. It's like a love affair you
understand too wetl—it will
get boring.”

Tuesday evening, after lec-
turing during the day at the
University of North Carolina
at Charlotte. where she is as-
sociate professor of art. Miss
Gatewood returned to David-
son for a session on *‘The Role
of the Artist."’ She explained
the problem facing the creator
who is assaulted by modern
communication media.

He must be aware of what is
liappiening in the art world and
still maintain a basic integrity
that allows him to absorb.
restate, but not become deriv-

or real purpose. “‘It’s just
created insanity, a drug ex:
perience without drugs.”

Although it is hard if not im-
possible to define. a happen.
ing is involved with communi-
cations. with the creation of
an environment which should
arouse some type of feeling in
the audience to the point that
there is no longer an audience,
but instead an extension of
the characters participating.

Artistically, Williams — ex-
plained, a happening belongs
to the neo-dada: tradition in
that it is actually anti art. ‘It
tejects laws and attacks bour-
geois sensitivity.”

There is no limit to the range
of happenings, examples of
which include.a girl marrying
a Volkswagen, a boy reading
a book and then burning the
pages and a hazardous voy-
age across a courtyard of
tires. The actors need no train-
ing: the stage can be any-
where. :

The stage for Davidson's
happening will be in the drama
workshop. Williams advises
that people wishing to attend
should wear old clothes “that
are expressive of their per
sonalities’’ and feel free to fol-
low whatever impulses are
created in them at the hap
pening.

Like all happenings. the Da.
vidson one will be designed to
be irrational: it will attempt
to make participants trans-
cend their physical bodies and
enter the realm of the imag
ination.

“Its only justification.’’ Wil-
liams commented; “is that
through it perhaps you will!
experience something you
have not experienced.”

ative to the point of imitation.
In the studio. his main concern
is with the making of the
painting. but he must also deal
with the buying public in an
age when art is bought and
sold like shares of stock.

During the month of April
an exhibition of Maud Gate-
wood's work is on display in
the Cunningham Fine Arts
Building.

The honesty of her intel-
Jectual approach to the prob-
lem of art is reflected in
the bold application of paint
to the canvas. but often the
painter is better as a crafts-
man than the paintings show.

“The longer I paint, the
simpler. yet more subtle and
thus more difficult--my pur-
pose becomes,"" she said.
“What is involved is never
quite pinpointed and is con-
tinually changing: so, guided
by integrity, I continue this
pursuit."

That is to say as a creator
her perception of environment
and actual applicatioh of paint
are often superior to the un-
derstanding of color and sense

Arts Festival Theme

Is “‘What’s Going On’

By SAM DARBY
Staff Writer

The Fine Arts Festival is a
month-long celebration through
which the various departments
will attract student interest

“by performing. displaying.
talking and informing the gen-
eral populace of ‘‘what’s go-
ing on.”

Featured earlier this month
were Petre Taylor, the short
story writer who presented
the Vereen Bell award: Jose
Molina Bailes Espanoles: the
Drama Workshop production
of Endgame; a recital by
Grier Williams and Anita Bult-
an; a recital by the Woodwind
Ensemble: and a two day visit
from Miss Maud Gatewood,
associate professor of art at
the University of North Caro-
lina extension in Charlotte.

Miss Gatewood kicked off
two weeks of concentrated
festivity by presenting two
talks. teaching a couple of
classes, and in. general | sub-
mitting herself to the David.
son scene. A collection of her
paintings is on exhibit in the
Stowe Galleries. .

Tonight there will be a con-
cert by the Male Chorus in
Hodson Hall, followed by a
reception in the galleries by
the light. of Miss Gatewood’s
exhibition. Monday night Wil-
liam Watkins, organist and
choirmaster of the George-
town Presbyterian Church,
will give a recital in the Da

vidson College Presbyterian
Church.

Paul Green. a Reynolds
Lecturer. will speak and pre-
sent a slide program entitled
“The Outdoor Drama" Tues.

Quartet from Pennsylvania
State University will give a
concert.

_ Friday is the last big day
of the festival. The Annual
Student Art Auction will be
held in the Morrison Room
with Tom Covington serving

should be turned in at the
Union desk by April 24 in or-

SORE Rate -

der that the selection commit-
tee will have time to do its
work.

That night, Friday, April
28. Fine Arts Festival history
will be made with the hap.
pening that will take place on
stage and in the workshop of
Hodson Hall. Precious little
information seems to be forth.
coming. but people are asked
to wear old clothes as paint.
whipped cream flowers. pies
and things could be flying
around.

But a happening is what the
participants make it, and the
battle is half won when there

is uninhibited participation: at
least that’s what the Happen-
ing Committee is saying,

Exhibitions of painting and
sculptures by students will
continue through May in Hod-
son Hall. the foyer of Cham-
bers and thé lobby of the Un-
jon.

Members of the Fine Arts
Festival Committee are Ru-
pert Barber, Douglass Houch-
ens, Donald Plott. David
Richey, Shaw Smith and
James Purcell. The happening
is under the direction of Rob
Williams.

Clark Describes Sculpturing
As A Frustrating Pleasure

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Asst. Managing Editor

“It's frustrating - you can’t
get it to come out —- it’s. just
basic sin. no. incompetence.”
said Dr..Tom Clark of. sculp
turing.

Clark, a professor of Bible
and amateur sculptor who has
been pursuing his hobby for
I! years. is giving technique
instruction to four students.

Dave McCorkle is receiving
credit. but Ross Cornwell, Tim
Rotherme! and Locke Holland,
became interested ‘from a
museum - spectator — stand-
point.” Clark said. ‘‘They re.
ceive no credit. and I receive
no pay.”

“There is a different pleas
ure about sculpturing.”” Clark
commented, *‘a chance to do
it with your hands instead of
a brush.”

A bust takes about 12 hours
to complete. and in the first
three only the hands are used.
Usually there are four three.
hour sessions.

McCorkle has been in charge
of securing the models, Clark
said. Models have ranged from
one of the girl cheerleaders
to Herb Jackson (see picture
at right) to “Bobby. who car
ties beer cartoons for Hat-
tie’s.”

Normally. the model sits for
15 minutes and gets a five
minute break. But. Clark said,
“we require a different angle
each time. so that we can get

of space.

She is ready to admit that
smal) paintings are particular
ly difficult because they be
come set on the canvas before
she has had sufficient time to
deal with the space.

However. in the larger
works, such as “‘Drive-In."' all
the elements work. together
beautifully so that the = sur-
face breathes with life.

Maud Gatewood is not con-
cerned with the meaning of a
painting or content, but rather
the message. She disagrees
with the restriction that paint-
ings must be of something
else.

Instead, she says. their mes-
sage is their being. The mes
sage of Maud Gatewood is
her being -aware. strong and
honest.

Several of Maud Gatewood's
paintings are featured in the
brochure on the festival pub-
lished by the festival com-
mittee.

All 32 which are on display
in the Cunningham Fine Arts
Center are for sale.

the perspective.”

Clark characterized McCor:
kle as a sculptor of “real tal
ent.”” The bust of Herb Jackson
is “‘the best thing he's done.”

“They're all different.” ob
served Clark. ‘'I don't: tell
them: any special method to
use. I only try to show them
the relationships’ of various
parts of the head.

“Every person sees some
thing in his own fashion. I'm
not telling them to do an ab
stract, or to do it rough or
smooth." he insisted.

Each model is done in clay.
then baked in a kiln outside
Charlotte. Busts are left on top
of flower: pots in the kiln to
bake.

After the clay has been
baked. a plaster cast is made
of the head. in two sections.
The cast: is ‘then filled with
plaster. When the plaster in
side is dry. the cast is chip
ped away to produce the fin-
ished bust.

After the first sitting. a
knifelike “‘stick’’ is used. The
stick resembles a dinner knife.
with a spoon shaped blade.
Often. there is a wire loop on
the other end for digging out
clay.

No courses are offered as
such in sculpturing, but credit
is possible through special ar-
rangement with the art de-
partment,
