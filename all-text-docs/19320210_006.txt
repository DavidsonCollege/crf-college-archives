THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 10, 1932

RESULT OF QUESTIONNAIRE

(Continued from page 1)
111 voted against our intervention and 78 voted
in favor of it.

The League of Nations has long been a topic
of discussion in the local history and political
science classes, and it was thought wise to in-
clude this topic in the questionnaire. The col-
lege as a whole favored the membership of the
United States in the League of Nations, voting
for it 347 to 211. The Sophomores barely
passed the measure at 70 to 60.

The department of the greatest controversy
among Davidson students was covered by the
last two questions. The Reserve Officers Train-
ing Corps is included in the curriculum here,
and is required of members of the Freshman
and Sophomore classes. To the surprise of
many, ‘no doubt, R. O. T. C. met with the ap-
proval of the student body by a count of 338
to 218, even the two lower classes ratifying it.
The Freshmen voted for it at 98 to 93, and the
Sophomores at 67 to 60: Among the Juniors
and Seniors the plurality was rather large.

That R. O. T. C. does not make a person
“war-minded was voiced by a huge majority of
405 to 145,

“DOC” NEWTON BRINGS RECORD

(Continued from page 1)
that year that the Orioles established a world’s
record of winning 27 consecutive games. New-
ton hurled six of the 27 contests. Baltimore won
the Junior World Series that year.

In 1921, Coach Newton pitched for Birming-
ham of the Southern League, winning nine of
the 16 contests he hurled, and the following
year he managed the Montgomery club of the
South Alabama League. In the summers of
1923, 1924, and 1925, he was with baseball
clubs at St. Joseph, Mo., Little Rock, and Kin-
ston, Va., in the respective years,

He did not enter the coaching game until
1923, when he tutored the Jones Valley High

School in Birmingham to a championship. So |’

successful was he that he was selected in 1925
by Howard College as assistant freshman foot-
ball coach, freshman basketball mentor, and
varsity baseball tutor. The next year he was
elevated to the varsity coaching staff in foot-
ball, continuing his work with the varsity basket-
ball team and varsity baseball club. ”

Howard College has consistently won over
Birmingham-Southern, its keen rival in Bir-
mingham, so the latter-institution, after he had
had a part in two successive defeats by How-
ard, gave him a contract in 1928, Birmingham-
Southern won over Howard that year, and the
defeated institution decided that they wanted him
back. He returned to Howard and remained for
two years as director of intra-mural athletics,
varsity line coach in football, varsity baseball
tutor, and freshman basketball.

The following fall Coach Neyland obtained
him for Tennessee as a scout for his football
varsity, and also to coach varsity baseball. The
latter has been abolished at Tennessee, and had
not Davidson obtained Coach Newton he prob-
ably would have returned to the Volunteers in
the continued capacity of a scout. There was
no place open for a line coach at Tennessee,
though Coach Neyland needed an additional
man on his backfield staff, which McEver was
going to fill until he accepted the Davidson
offer. . :

football. His baseball playing ability was rec-
ognized this week when the Knoxville Smokies
handed him a contract which he signed, and
also by the fact that Philadelphia of the Na-
tional League was looking him over. Mckver
is also a basketball player, though this is by no
means hit strongest forte.

It is well known that Capt. Norton G. Pritch-
ett, professor of physical education at David-
son and the man who is largely responsible for
reviewing prospective candidates for the coach-
ing staff here, is ordinarily opposed to all-
Americans as coaches. There were three all-
American possibilities for Davidson.

In reference to McEver, however, Captain
Pritchett said that his prejudice against an all-
American as a coaching prospect was dispelled
“after lengthy conferences with Tennessee offi-
cials and professors, who regard Mac so highly
as a leader and a student of football.”

“As a rule,” continued this Davidson official,
“an outstanding athlete is frequently little more
than a splendid physical specimen, endowed by
nature with certain faculties that fit him more
for demonstration than teaching. Coaching, how-
ever, requires objective rather than subjective
skill.

“But from what I heard*from several sources
about Mac, his contribution to athletics will
continue” in~a~very— effective--way;—-other—than.
through accounts of his personal performance on
the field.” Following this statement, Captain
Pritchett talked at length about. the many good

| Both of these men reported to Davidson Mon-

|day to take charge of the remaining weeks of
ithe winter football practice, which was being
|

;conducted by Coaches Younger and Tilson.

Newton was signed up to coach baseball at
Tennessee this spring, but that sport has been
abolished there. He was consequently available
for immediate service.

McEver will spend a month at Davidson un-
til the winter practice sessions are completed
and will then return to Tennessee for the last
quarter and summer school, which are neces-
sary for his graduation. He was out of college
a year and a half because of injuries, but will
be able to complete his work in two quarters.

Coaches Younger and Tilson are to continue
on the staff at Davidson, and will have charge
of other sports during the spring. Newton and
McEver will be*here only during the winter
football training. Younger will continue his
work with the Freshman basketball squad, and
will coach baseball. Tilson will head the track
work,

as Field and Candidate Secretary. Although he
has been out of his office all the time for prac-
tically the last two months, speaking all over
the South, he is able to accept only a small
percentage of invitations which come to him.
