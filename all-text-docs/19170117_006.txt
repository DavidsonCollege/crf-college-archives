The DAVIDSONIAN, January 17, 1917

SUMMER CONFERENCE
OF STUDENTS IN THE
BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS

“Save a dollar a week” is the title of
a placard going to each student Y. M.
C. A. in the South at this time. This
is an advance word concerning the
unique gathering of students held every
Summer in the heart of the Blue Ridge
Mountains.

“Blue Ridge” is a place unsurpassed
in natural beauty, convenience and com-
fort. Located near the mountain vil-
lage of Black Mountain, and only fif-
teen miles from Asheville, it is increas-
ingly hecoming the play-ground for the
entire South. Here are the most ma-
jestic mountains of the entire Eastern
America-High Top, the Craggies, Black
the Seven Sisters, Clingman’s Dome.
and Mitchel, the highest east of the
Rockies. Mountain climbing, therefore.
as well as sight-seeing, kodaking, and
the like, alwavs occupy a prominent
place in one’s stay at Blue Ridge. An‘
abundant facilities for tennis, base ball.
vollev ball, basket ball, and swimming
complete the list.

The equipment, too, furnishes every
necessity. ‘Ihe spacious Robert E. Lec
Hall, and the numerous cottages built
by the colleges, furnish the most com-
fortable “quarters.” ‘The grounds and
buildings are all supplied with electric
lights, water works, sewerage and every
other modern convenience.

It is here that the men convene their
conference just after the close of the
college women's gathering. It is here
that the students gather for addresses
for Bible study, mission study, for round
table discussions, for enlarged concep:
tions of and thoro training in the whol.
program of religious work in the col
leges and preparatory schools. It is
here that men have often secured aid on
their life work. And it is here thru
comradeship one student with another
and with great student leaders like
Robert E. Speer, Bishop McDowell, E.
T. Colton, Dr. E. M. Poteat, Dr. O.
E. Brown, Prof. H. H. Horne, Dr. W.
D. Weatherford, and others, that men
have caught a new vision for themselves.
as well as a new sense of their responsi-
bility to their fellowmen. It is here, in
fact, that men have been inspired to do
their work.

Over ‘four hundred men were in at-
tendance at this gathering last June.
Already scores of students are planning
for the next one—June 12-21, 1917.
Many men will make good the oppor-
tunity while at home Christmas to plan
this next greater gathering.

EMORY AND ROANOKE
TO BE DEBATED

Judging from the manner of prepara-
tion of thoge interested, there will be
some good speeches given in the prelimi-
naries for the inter-collegiate debating
team on January 29th, in the halls of the
Eu, and Phi. Societies. Four men will
be chosen from each society who will
comnete in the finals in Shearer Hall
on February 12th.

The Debating Council has arranged
a debate with Emory University, of
Oxford, Ga., to be held at Agnes Scott.
near the ist of April. The subject will
be the same as the one to be used in
the preliminaries: “Resolved. That em-
ployers and emplovees of Public Service
Corporations should be compelled to set-
tle their disputes by arbitration.” Dav-
idson will defend the negative.

A debate is also to be held at Salem.
Va., with "Roanoke College, of Salem,
Vo., on April 2oth. Two questions
have been submitted bv Davidson, and
Roanoke has the privilege of choosing
the subject and side.

OUR CONTEMPORARIES.

The Sun Dial—The Senior Class at
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College has
adopted the custom of wearing uniform
collars. The other classes reporr the
appearance of the line to be noticeably
improved and all wonder why the cus-
tom was not established long ago.

College Topics—Dr. John H. Wig-
more, Dean of the Law School at Nor h-
western University, delivered the three
lectures that are given annually under
the auspices of the Barbour-Page Foun-
dation at the University of Virginia.
“Problems of the Law” was the subject
chosen by Dr. Wigmore for the three
lectures, and he divided them into the
vroblems of the past, the present and the
future.

The Vanderbilt Hustler—A new sys-
tem of grading has been announced for
all classes in the School of Medicine of
Vanderbilt. In this system only three
letters are used—P., C., and F. P. mean-
pass, C., condition, and F. fail. Al!
grades from 70 to 100 are denoted bv
P., from 55-70, by C., and from 0-55
by F.

The Tar Heel—The second annua'
inter-collegiate debate between the Uni
versity of North Carolina and Georg:
Washineton. was held in Washineto~
December 18th, the U. of N. C. uphold
ine the affirmative of the question:
“Resolved, That Congress should pas:
a law requiring comnulsory arbitration
of all controversies arising between the
«moloyers and the emplovees of rail
roads engared in interstate commerce
onstitutionality waived,” lost by a 2 t-
t decision altho they put up a strong
defense.

TIME TO LEAVF SCHOOL.

The bevy who is impatient to leave
school and begin earning money will de
‘vell to realive that a good edication ic
the most efficient tool in carving aut a
living. A proof of this is faund in the
action of a large factory in New York
which has established a school for its
emplovees, and pays them full wages
for attending its sessions in work hours.
The firm’s object is to raise the standard
of work and to eliminate the loss and
annovance caused bv the failure of illit-
erate workers to understand and follow
directions. They report that the work-
ers who have heen trained in this schoo!
shaw a gain of from 20 to 70 per cent
in efficiency.—Pleasant Hours.

POINTS ON READING.

How often a person will say, “Oh, I
have just finished a splendid book. No.
I can’t remember the title or the author,
but it was perfectly fine.” On = such
careless reading, Alan Northman, whose
hook page is one of the most distin-
cuished features of the Sunday School
Chronicle, has this to say:

“To read carelessly is worse than not
to read at all; that to read with intel-

ligence, you must fix your mind upon| HOTEL MORGAN, - - - Danville, Va.

the title of the book, which probably
means something: that, if the book is
worth anything. it is ‘bad form’ to neg-
lect the author’s name, and in this way
is worse than wicked; and that, in the
best cases, even the publisher’s name
should be carefully studied.”

Among those confined at the Infirm-
ary are J. B. Daffin, 18; J. E. Mc-
Keithen, '18: E. B. Burns, ’19, and L.
H. Patterson, the Jast named suffering
with measles. F. R. Spratt, ’20, was
recently stricken with mumps, and has
returned to his home.

Mrs. Brawlev, of Rrevard. N. C., is
now with her sister, Mrs. Withers.
