(5) This lesson can be learned from
yesterday’s fighting: that an attack with
partially trained troops and inexperi-
enced officers is a risky and costly un-
dertaking; and that intelligent direction
of forces is possible only when the com-
mander is in close touch with all the
elements of that force.

evitable stragglers, the meagre “ dis-
patches from the front, all agree that
the fighting was most sanguinary. As
the Blue waves rushed down the fatal
slopes brave men fell and braver, rush-
ing up to fill the gaps, fell atop of them,
to write in their agony in the life-blood
of their fellows. The slopes were red
with the blood of fair young manhood of
the South. They fought and suffered
and died there, together—Rumpleite and

The Imperturbable Right.

It would seem that when Phillips en-
trusted his right to Lowry, he made a
wise choice indeed. Knowing his man
through and knowing the need of a cool
mpireturbable officer on that flank—
which was expected to meet stout re-
sistance—he chose Lowry ‘to lead his
right; Lowry, veteran of ten campaigns
and 30 marches; Lowry, wearer of more
medals than a Mexican field marshal,
Lowry of the inflexible will. That the
right was well handled is admitted by
all. Out of the hurly-burly of the ac-
tion one little story of the right’s com-
mander came to your correspondent: A
Red spy managed to;creep through the
Blue lines, along which men were placed
shoulder to shoulder; where and how
did he get through?

were the Blues that the engagement did

forces from the reserve, under Colonel
Gibson, never crossed Hoyt’s Creek; ex-

a‘few patrols were sent across that
stream.

The boy was positive, but to make
sure: “Ma,” he called, “Ain’t I just nine
years old?”

“Yes, son.”

After a time he ventured, “Say, mister,
what made you think I was more than
nine years old?”

“Why,” said the stranger, “I couldn’t
understand how you could get so dirty
in nine years.”

It won’t do for a married man to say
