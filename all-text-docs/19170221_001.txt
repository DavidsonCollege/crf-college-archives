Defeated By Davidson

Red and Black Quint Adds Two
More Victories

GUILFORD GAME.

The Davidson quint defeated Guil-
ford Friday night on the Statesville floor
by a score of 19 to 18. The game was
loosely played and the floor work and
shooting by both teams was: below the
standard. Davidson started off strong
and piled up a substantial Jead in the first
half. Guilford staged a come-back in
the last period and the score was tied
time and again. With the score standing
at 18 to 18 in the last few seconds of
play, a foul was called on Guilford, and
“AI” Reese, equal to the emergency,
caged a pretty basket for the deciding
point.

For Davidson the work of Reese and
Hengeveld was of the highest order.
while Zachary and Massey played strong
games for Guilford.

Given Last Saturday

Mr. R. D. W. Connor Speaks On
An Interesting Subject

The student body of Davidson Col-
lege and the town people were given a
treat last Saturday, when Mr. R. D. W.
Connor, of Raleigh, delivered two highly
interesting and _ instructive lectures in
Shearer Hall on “The Racial Elements
Which Have Entered Into the Popula-
tion of North Carolina.” Mr. Connor

is Secrétary of the North Carolina Lit-
ears and Historical Association, and his
thoro knowledge of the subject on which
he spoke, combined with his pleasing de-
livery, made his lectures entertaining
indeed. ‘

The racial elements which Mr. Con-
nor discussed were the English. the
Scotch Highlander, the Scotch-Irish, and.
the German. In his afternoon address
he took up the first two, and at night he
spoke of the contributions of the Scotch-
Trish and German elements to North
Carolina's history. A very comprehen-
sive view of the early history of North
Carolina, with the life and manners and
characteristics of the colonial settlers,
was ably shown.

FIRST LECTURE,

The speaker showed that the popula-
iton of North Caroline is a composite
one, and we are not one people, but an
offspring of the four great elements that
influenced the settlement and develop-
ment of the State—the English, the
Scotch Highlander, the Scotch-Irish and
the German. The English were the first
settlers, and by purchasing lands from
the Indians, which they might have seiz-
ed, they laid the foundations of the col-
ony in peace and good will. These people
settled in the eastern part of the State,
particularly in the Cape Fear section.
The early struggles of these colonists
were pointed out, how they overcame the
Indians and pirates, wrested a represen-
tative government from the lord pro-
prietors, and laid the foundations of a
strong government on the English ideals
of home life, government add industry.
The English settler was a prosy, com-
mon sense individual. who possessed all
the qualities for the conquest of — the
wilderness and the founding of a com-
monwealth. The life and manners of
these people were shown, and the speaker
summarized hy stating that their con-
tribution was largely political.

SCOTCH HIGHLANDER.

THE
The Scotch Highlander offers a great
contrast to the Englishmen in character
and temperament. He is not so prosaic,
but impulsive. Their home in the old
country was vividly described, and their
peculiar ideas of government and so-
ciety, which make them a people apart.
They were great fighters. | Economic
and political causes drove them to North
Carolina, where they settled on the upper
Cape Fear. Their institutions finally
had to give way to the English forms.
and the English tongue also triumphed
over the Gaelic. These people have dis-
tinguished themselves thruout our his-
tory and have proven strong and, truce
in every crisis. The names of many illus-
trious men descended from this element
were called to mind.

Play to Scoreless Tie| Of The Week in Town

Class Football Championship Still|Social and Personal Items About

Undecided

On last Tuesday the Juniors and Sen-
iors prolonged the class football season
by playing a no-score tie. The game was
hotly contested from the start, but
neither goal was in positive danger at
any time. The ball see-sawed up and
down the field from start to finish and
exchanges of punts were frequent. The
Juniors suffered telling losses by injuries,
carly in the game, but managed to hold
their own. For the Seniors the work of
Keesler and Ratchford was of the stellar
variety. Jones, Clark and Richardson
put up strong games for the Juniors.

The line-up was as tollows:
