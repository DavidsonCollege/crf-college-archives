Honor Council hosts information sessions, —

welcomes new members

The Honor Council at Davidson is, to many
students, a thing of mystery. Is there a secret
handshake or do the members wear matching
robes? What goes on at the meetings? How do
they function? They are an influence in all of
our lives, and yet many of us are not sure of
what they do.

Fortunately, the Honor Council is planning
programs to open up their organization and
answer many of the questions: students may
have. Atthe top of the list were the elections on
Monday. The turnout for the fall was large,
with 18 sophomores running for four available
spots; eight juniors running for two spots; and
seven seniors running for one spot. The inter-
estin the Honor Council speaks volumes about
the importance of the organization on
Davidson’s campus.

The students elected three new honor coun-
cil members in yesterday’s Category I elec-
tions. Seniors chose David Moscowitz ’03,

and the junior class elected Susan Robinson
°04 and Steven Root ’04.

The Honor Council, an organization com-
posed of thirty students, hears cases of Honor
Code violations and sentences any found vio-
lators. In addition to enforcing the Honor
Code on campus, the Honor Council also
addresses the more expansive Code of Re-
sponsibility.

Soon after the newly elected members have
settled into their positions, the Honor Council
hopes to distribute an informative question-
naire to the student body. Mary Carpenter ’04,
Honor Council secretary, said, “In the next
few weeks, we, with the help of SGA, will be
conducting a school-wide poll in order to get
students’ opinions on the Honor Council and
Honor Code and Code of Responsibility is-
sues.” With the facts accumulated from the
polls, the Council will plan educational pro-
grams for the student body on the Codes and
set objectives for the year.

Carpenter said, “One of the Council’s big-
gest goals is to focus some of our energy onthe

Code of Responsibility, and on making it more
prevalent in and applicable to life on campus.”

The Code of Responsibility, part of the foun-
dation for life at Davidson, is often overlooked:
by Davidson students. Carpenter said, “Many
students don’t realize how important and seri-
ous this Code is, and we want to try to change
that.”

One way change is being implemented is
through cooperative actions with Patterson
Court representatives. “A new internal com-
mittee aimed at working with Patterson Court
houses and members has been created to dis-
cuss the role of both the Honor Code and the
Code of Responsibility on the Court,” said
Carpenter. “So many people have misconcep-
tions and miscommunications about the roles
that the Codes play on the Court.”

The Honor Council hopes that the changes
within the organization will subsequently alter
the attitudes of Davidson students, raising
awareness of how the Honor Code and Code of
Responsibility affect daily life.

Fraternities and eating houses will have the
option of either a full service kitchen or a
warming kitchen. The warming kitchen is

designed for houses intending to. have food

broughtin, whereas the full service kitchen is
for houses that hire a chef to cook in the house.

All new kitchens will feature a commercial -

dishwasher.

The planned renovations will make the
houses safer places. More advanced smoke
detectors and sprinklers will be installed
throughout each house, as well as fire-safety
compliant doors. The houses will be hard
wired for the Internet and cable and audio
systems, eliminating dangerous loose cables
in and out of the buildings.

The school is currently working to make all
houses handicapped accessible. Every house
will have amen’s and a women’s handicapped
accessible restroom, a major upgrade from the
current “one-holers” in the dorms. “The bath-
rooms in the houses are not really adequate for
the amount of people there on the weekends; I
have noticed some of the grass around them
grows particularly well,” said Holthouser, only
half-joking.

The tentative renovation timeline is based
on the 2001 standards report. Rusk has already
submitted its plan for renovation and all the
other organizations will submit a plan around
Thanksgiving break.
