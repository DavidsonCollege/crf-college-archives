After absorbing their
conference foes, the
Davidson  cagers’
chances for landing a
tourney berth appear
to be about gone. Their
conference record to
date stands at two wins
and eight losses which
places them near the
bottom in conference
standing.

One thing should be
remembered, however.
Six of those eight
losses were dealt by
State, Duke, and UNC. By GORDON SCOTT
Even the most optimistic would have given Davidson no more
than two wins from this group. The loss to South Carolina and
the earlier defeat by Clemson hurt the Cats, for these two games
were needed badly to raise Davidson stock for an invitation
to the Durham tournament. Clemson’s win was just one of those
grames—it could have gone either way, and the loss to South
Carolina wasn’t so bad in that the Gamecocks have no better
than average quintet. Nevertheless, the fact remains that losses
to these two South Carolina schools knocked the props from
under Davidson’s playing in the tournament.

A look at the schedule of games for the remainder of the
season reveals that the Cats have ten more games to play—
eight of them conference fights. We’re optimistic enough to
concede that Davidson still has an outside chance of making
an appearance in the Durham classic. Of course, it’s no small
order for a team, no matter what calibre, to win cight straight
games, but at this stage of the game, it looks ns though that’s
what it will take. Davidson is one of the few smaller conference
schools who tangle with State, Duke and UNC twice each year,
and conference standings to date show the affect it has had.
The rough part of the schedule is over. The question now is
whether Baird’s inexperienced but game’ crew can stay ‘‘up’’
enough to win from here on down the stretch. The Cats will
be favored to win the rest of their games, with the exception
of the South Carolina contest in Columbia, and there is a very
possible upset in the making in this ease.

WHERE’S THAT SPIRIT ? ? ?

During the second half of the South Carolina-Davidson
zame Tuesday night, Davidson rooters had very little to cheer
about. But there was certainly more to yell about than the
amount of cheering that went on would indicate. When South
Carolina started pulling away, the bottom seemed to fall out of
not only the team but the student body as well. At times, the
uym was 80 quiet that you could have heard someone blow his
nose on the other side of the building. It would be a sad
repetition of the past if the Davidson student body spirit is al-
lowed to fall by the wayside just because the team loses a game.
On the other hand, spirit among the players seemed to drop al-
most completely during the final stages of the game. If this
happens then the cheering section will invariable follow suit,
because in basketball, as probably in no other sport, the spirit
and fight of the participants is greatly reflected in the cheering
section. So it works both ways. Fans and players have ‘a joint
responsibility in seeing that, spirit stays at a high pitch.

‘7’ MINDED GRIDDERS BUCKLE DOWN

Crowell Little, who had previously announced that he will

experiment with the Diamond ‘‘T’’ in spring football sessions, |

lost little time in getting his backfield charges indoctrinated
with a few fundamentals of the ‘‘T’’ formation in the prelim-
inary practice Wednesday afternoon. Little put his backs
through their paces while coaches Brown, Redding, Jamerson,
and Buddy Chandler worked with the linemen. ‘The weather
was crisp and a cool wind kept the gridders dancing around to
keep warm. The boys were dressed out in heavy equipment but
there was no contact work. Chandler and Redding’ worked
with some of the linemen on blocking fundamentals and used
one of the mechanical blocking sleds. Jim Fasul charged the
sled so hard on one block that he broke one of its big springs.
Needless to say, that’s one bill the Athletic Department won't

mind paying.

THE DAVIDSONIAN .

PIKAS PACE LOOP

PAGE THREE

By C. D. STRIBLING

For his brilliant performances on
the Kardwood during the last week,
we cite Fred “Dutch” Hengeveld as
Wildcat of the week. In spite of a
losing cause “Dutch” has been the
scoring spark in many of the re-
cent games with his deadly set
shot. Tuesday night against the
University of South Carolina Dutch
was the high point man for the
Wildcats with eleven points. He
usually shoots set shots from be-
hind the foul circle and has a really
remarkable cye for the basket. Even
without-much time to get set,
Dutch usually manages to swish
through several baskets every
game. He also garners a lot of
points by way of the free throw
line. Dutch is a guard but the way
he gets in there and scraps for
those rebounds one would think
he was a 6°6” center. He looks as if
he’s vot springs in his legs instead
of muscles and he’s a quick man
on a fast break.

Dutch is a junior and # member
of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. In
the spring he is the top pitcher on
the Davidson baseball nine.

With one more year after this
one Dutch shows promise of de-
veloping into one of the best ath-
letes seen around Davidson in a
long time, Dutch is a Davidson boy
and his father is College Registrar.

Little and Charges
Begin Spring Drill

By BILL ADAMS

At 4 o’clock Wednesday after-
noon, the first day of February,
Coach Crowell Little and his staff
began an intensive Spring football
program with high hopes of laying
a sound foundation for next fall’s
football wars.

An estimated squad of from 50
to 65 boys turned out in answer to
Little’s call. Heading the list of
candidates is Captain Auburn Lam-
beth and alternate-Captain Wood
Leach with some 18 letter winners
from last year’s squad and numer-
ous rising sophomores from, this
year’s Freshman squad. Gone from
last year’s team are 17 seniors in-

cluding such worthies as Bob
Sharpe, Buddy Chandler, Carl
Eborn, Johnny Richards, Sandy
Carnegie, Charlie Rimer, Jake

Wade, Cliff Turner, and Jim Sif-
ford.

Coach Little said he plans to con-
tinue the Spring practice until base-
ball season begins. After that he
will continue to have informal prac-
tice for boys participating in win-
ter sports and unable to take part
in the regular spring sessions. A
new system will definitely be in-
stalled. Little said he plans to work

Carolina and Duke
Drop Cats Again

' Davidson’s cagers followed up a
ten day examination period by drop-
ping two games to Southern cén-
ference rivals, Duke University and.
the University of North Carolina.

The Blue Devils of Duke got
off to a fast start and took a seven
point lead in the opening minutes
against the Wildcats. Held scoreless
for the first four and a half minutes,
Davidson finally stripped the net
to get into the scoring column, By
playing heads up ball and capi-
talizing on the Wildcats’ mistakes,
the Dukes surged forward to hold
a 42-26 lead at the end of the first
half. As the second half got uwnder-
way, Davidson began to play a dif-
ferent brand of basketball and rap-
idly closed up the gap between the
scores, getting within three points
of the Blue Devils with less than
four minutes to go. The closing
minutes saw goals by all-conference
“Cup” Youmans and Groat, and
four foul shots by Hughes, while
the Wildcats were held scoreless.
The final score. Duke 69, David-
son 59,

Traveling to Chapel Hill for a
game Saturday night, the Wildcats
met with their second conference
foe in as many nights, the Univer-
sity of North Carolina.

The Carolina Tar Heels, paced
by the good offensive play of
Isantes, took the scoring lead about
half way into the first half and
were never behind from that time

on. Holding an eight point lead at

halftime, North Carolina began

that his system would definitely be

with the fullback a little behind

essentials of the split-T. Some

Slaughter and Cox Combine Talents
.¢ __|As Gamecocks Down Cats, 66-46

By CHARLIE HAWKINS

The Davidson Wildcats, fighting
for a berth in the Southern Con-
ference Tournament, suffered a re-
verse at the hands of Coach Frank
Johnson’s Gamecocks of the Uni-
versity of South Carolina Tuesday
night in Johnston Gym, 66-46, It
was a hard one to lose for Coach
Boyd Baird of Davidson and his
bays, but the game did prove that
the inexperienced Wildcats were
gaining some much-needed court
savvy.

A zone thrown up by the Pres-
byterians to stop South Carolina's
6 11" center, Jim Slaughter, was
effective for one half, but lost its
punch later in the game. In putting
two men on Slaughter, the Wild-
cats were open to shots from the
outside by the Gamecock guards.
and as a result suffered for it, for
both South Carolina guards were
snaking set shots with accuracy.

The game started off fast as Cox,
who starred for South Carolina all
sank a set shot
to put the Gamecocks ahead, 2-0.
After 4 1-2 minutes of play, the

fighting ‘Cats had spurted to a 6-3.

lead, as Hengeveld began to hit.
From here on it was nip and tuck
until: 10 minutes had clapsed and
South Carolina was ahead, 17-14,
tlengeveld had cashed in on 5 more
points, and Slaughier, who had be-

began “putting on the steam.”
Cross netted 13 and Montgomery
12. Graham and Vance led their
teammates for scoring honors with
14 and 11 respectively.

baskets apiece. A Hengeveld set
shot and a follow by Brooks put
Davidson ahead, 18-17, but it was
quickly counter-acted by 3 succes-
sive goals by the diminutive Game-
cock guard, Don Cox. A set shot
by Len Ekinoff and a pivot by
Slaughter, both of South Carolina,
were matched by Holler’s push
and Hengeveld’s sct shot as the
score moved to 22-27. A free toss
by Lazenby moved the score to

try to protect the lead and at the
