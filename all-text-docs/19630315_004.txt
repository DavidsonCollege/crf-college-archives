JOHN BAUM

John Baum, a history major,
is from Milledgeville, Ga. Last
year Baum, a member of Alpha
Tau Omega, served as Activities
Editor of the Quips and Cranks
and currently as its Managing
Editor.

First of all, what is an An-
nual and what is its pur-
-pose? Technically, it is that
publication which by means
of pictures and copy record.
the important events, hap-
penings, and interests of the
student body of that particu-
lar year.

However, an Annual can be
more than simply that. It should
enable us in later years to re-
eall with a feeling of warmth
and pride our tog few years in
college.

‘* The only way this is accom-
plished is through the use of
superb photography and imagin-
ative copy. In the realm of
photography there has to be a
realistic balance between shots
which are formal as opposed to
those which are informal or
even candid.

This blend of formality
with informality, sophistice-
tion with realism, | believe, is
a@ necessity for a memorable
Annual. If elected Editor of
the 1964 Quips & Cranks,
this will be one of the goats
for which we will strive.

As I said above, copy is the
second primary ingredient in
the make-up of an Annual. Per-
sonally, I feel the less copy the
better. However, some copy is
obviously necessary. When it is
nécessary, it should not only
contain the actual facts con-
cerning a particular event or
activity, but it should also be
written in such a way as to
arouse in us that feeling of
warmth and pride I mentioned
earlier. If this can be accom-
plished, the value of an Annual
is greatly enhanced. I will sin-
cerely try to see that that is
accomplished, if elected Editor
of next year’s Quips & Cranks.

A position such as this re-
quires experience with and
knowledge of the mechanics of
putting out an Annual. Last
year I served as Activities Edi-
tor. This year I have served as
Managing Editor. Through these
positions I have acquired valu-
able knowledge of the neces-
sary behind-the-scenes work and

‘headaches inherent in publish-
ing an Annual.

Our college days will pass and
our memories of those days will
become beclouded as the years
slip by. If elected Editor of the
1964 Quips & Cranks, I will
strive to edit an Annual which
will not only provide the means
of recalling our friends, profes-
sors, and events of that year,
but will recall them in such a
way as to make us feel proud of
having had the opportunity of
the Davidson Experience.

Terry To Speak
At Next Vespers

The vespers speaker for this
Sunday night will be the Rev.
Will Terry, Davidson College
chaplain. There are seven com-
pulsory vespers services remain-
ing in the semester and one
voluntary, the Easter service on
April 14.

Terry stated that the election
of speakers for vespers had, in
the past, been misunderstood
by a majority of students. The
speakers are selected by the.
chaplain and the Religious Life

MARTY LAFFERTY
‘Marty Lafferty, an economics
major from Concord, is the
Assistant Photography Editor of
the Quips and Cranks. A mem-

ber of Pi Kappa Alpha, Lafferty
has also worked as photographer

for the alumni office. .

What is the Quips &
Cranks? It is the annual his-
tory of Davidson College.
More particularly, it is a pic-
torial narrative, with com-
plementary copy, depicting
the life of the student both
on and off campus; his hab-
its, his activities, his en-
vironment.

Photography is the key word
in yearbook publications. You
need high quality photographs—
nothing but the best. But they
also need to have an aesthetic
quality in them to give them
meaning.

I advocate an annual which is
not only meaningful, but. artis-
tically appealing, using more
numerous full page and double
page spreads. Color should be
used wherever possible to en-
‘hance the beauty of the book.
Each section should be preced-
ed by a pictorial essay.

The old saying that “A picture
is worth a thousand words,” has
never been so true as it is to-
day. But pictures cannot and
must not be random shots. They
should convey meaning and
should maintain continuity with
the rest of the book.

An editor benefits from his
entire staff, but especially from
his photographer. It is of prim-
ary importance that the two
men work closely to produce
one result.

Could an editer be much
closer to his photographer
than for them to be one and
the same? The combination of
photographer-editor also cuts
expenses, making more funds
available for a better book.

Being a salaried photograph-
er for three years has made me
acutely aware of the artistic
talents that it takes to produce
a superb annual and gives me a
large source of information on
which I may draw.

I propose an annual of high
quality and appeal which will
rot only equal, but far surpass,
the annual of the last photo-
grapher-editor of the Quips &
Cranks, Charlie Rose.

BRUCE STEIGNER
Bruce Steigner, a pre-med ma-
jor from Columbia, S. C., has
served as Athletics Editor and
Fraternity Editor of the year-

book. Steigner, a Beta, is also

a member of Alpha Epsilon Del-
ta pre-med fraternity.

A yearbook is an organi-
zation. It is not so much
binder, copy, and pictures
as it is the product of a
group of individuals work-
ing to achieve a common
goal.

To achieve this goal, the year-
book organization must have
certain components: first, an
editor-in-chief with experience,
knowhow, and imagination;
second, a writer who can achieve
continuity of thought for the
entire book; third, skilled photo-
graphers who can competently
transfer actions and moods to
film and paper; fourth, reliable
section editors who can co-

ordinate photographers with

subjects. Each of these, as a
part of the whole, is necessary
for the production of this or
any other yearbook.

Yet the book itself, the final
product, the goal of the organ-
ization, has its own components;
there must be sections in it to
represent.the Classes, the Fa-
culty, the Student Organizations,
Athletics, and Social Life. Em-
phasis must be placed upon the
latter two in order to stress
their renewed importance to the
student as an individual. The
sum of these parts must be a
book that clearly and unambig-
uously answers the question,
“What was, what is, and what
will be Davidson College?”

t stated that there are four
components necessary for the
production of the yearbook;
the most importent of these
is the editor-in-chief, for upon
him lies the final responsibi-
Uty for every word and pic-
ture that goes to press. The
editor must have enough
imagination to plan s new
book, as well as the exper-
ience and knowhow to make
it work.

I believe that I can fulfill the
qualifications for the office of
Editor of the 1964 Quips and
Cranks; I have been a member
of the staff for three years and
have served both as Athletics
and Fraternities Editor. I have
worked closely with two Editors-
in-Chief and I believe I have the
experience, the knowhow, and,
I hope, the imagination to un-
dertake the responsibility of
that office.

WF Sets Final Plans

For State

Conclave

A state-wide Westminster Fellowship Synod Con-
ference will be held at Camp Stewart Friday night, March
15 through Sunday, March 17.

‘The. Davidson and Queens
Westminster Fellowships are in
charge of the function. It will
be an informal gathering of
about 75 people. The purpose
of the conference is centered
around an interest in social
work and how social organiza-
tions attack various problems in
society.

The group will visit Charlotte,
about 10 miles from the camp,
on Saturday. The purpose of the
excursion will be to make a
study of some the areas in Char-
lotte where social work is being
conducted and to examine some
of the problems of the underde-
veloped neighborhoods in Char-

Committee. Suggestions by stud- | lotte.

ents concerning topics and
speakers are welcomed.

-The aim of this selection is to
give students an opportunity to

The conference will also elect
a moderator, vice-moderator and
a clerk. Joe McCutchen, presi-
dent of Davidson Westminster
Fellowship, is running for the
office of state moderator; John
Crow is running for the office
of vice-moderator.

About 15 members of the Da-
vidson WF will be present. Dr.
J. D. Kelton, Chaplain Will Ter-
ry, and the Rev. Curtis Harper
will also attend as discussion
group leaders at the conference.

s ® e

The Davidson WF meeting
of March 22 will feature the last
installment of Dr. S. D. Malon-
ey's lectures on Rudolph Bult-
mann, a famous German theo-
logian. His topic, post-Bultmann-
ians, is the third in a series
which included a talk on Bult-
mann’s thought and an analysis
of criticisms of Bultmann’s theo-
logy. Local elections will also
be held at this meeting.

On March 29 Father Cuthbert
Allen of Belmont Abbey will
speak on the Ecumenical Coun-
cil in Rome to a joint meeting
of the Davidson and Queens WF
groups.

The two juniors below are seeking the office of Edi-

tor of the student humor and literary magazine, Scripts
‘n Pranks. Voting will be held on Wednesday, March 20.

HANK ACKERMAN
The present Business Manager
of the Seripts ‘n Pranks, Hank

' Ackerman is a history student

from Louisville, Ky. Ackerman
is also a member of the Publi-
cations Board and Beta Theta
Pi fraternity.

For the past five or six
years the Scripts ‘n Pranks
has been termed the ‘“‘bas-
tard” publication on cam-
pus. The question is, are the
reasons for its existence
really legitimate or not?
This question has been ask-
ed these years by the stud-
ents, administration, and
faculty alike, and they are
just beginning to forget it.

We must ask ourselves what
are the students’ needs in the
field of publications in general.
There is no doubt that the
Senior class annual, Quips ‘n
Cranks, and the student news-
paper, THE DAVIDSONIAN,
are essential to our lives as
students. But is there a need for
a magazine which tries to blend
into one, the humor and crea-
tivity of. college life?

Before the campus goes with-
out such a publication, I think
it should consider strengthening
the present, growing S ‘n P and
thus, taking a positive attitude
toward creativity, build it into
a publication which would rival
THE DAVIDSONIAN in its ap-
peal to the students.

What are the needs of the
S ‘n P now? The basic need of
the $ ‘n P is organization. But
organization of a staff is impos-
sible without serious student
backing. The Magazine Advisory
board, set up last year to heip
channel student writing to the
staff has been dormant. How-
ever, it could be effective in
working through English class-
es, Sigma Upsilon, and other
students as well.

A permanent staff is also
needed for preserving the con-
tinuity and tradition of the
S$ ‘n P from year to year as well
as from month to month.

What type of magazine should
the S ‘n P be, is an important
determination of the student
body. Should it be entirely hu-
morous, serious, or both? The
fact is that a totally literary
or serious magazine has not ap-
pealed to students in the past,
nor I doubt that it could today.
A totally humorous magazine,
perhaps, would be appealing:
but, in turn, it would not reflect
the entire abilities of the stud-
ents. I am convinced that a
blend of the two can be made,
as has been done in the past.

Good humorous literature, I
think, is the. optimum goal in
writing, but it is also the hard-
est to write. There are many
Shakespeares, Miltons, Words-
worths, and Dostoyevskys, but
are there many Chaucers?

I make no claims to an extra-
ordinary talent for writing, but
I would like the opportunity to
help better organize the $ ‘n P
staff in continuing the progress

JOHN ARIAIL

John Ariail is a history ma-
jor from Greenville, S. C. A
member of Kappa Alpha Order
social fraternity, Ariail is also
_a member of the Philanthropic
Literary Soicety, and on the

varsity tennis team.

Scripts and Pranks has al-

ways been somewhat of a

bastard publication and I
suppose it will always stay
that way. No other publica-

tion comes and goes and

changes its personality the
way Scripts and Pranks

does.

Part of this occurs because
Scripts and Pranks is attempt-

ing to play the role of two types

of magazines—literary and hu-
mour. Much of the rest of the
problem can be traced back to

the fact that usually there is no
continuity of the magazine from
issue to issue or even of the
staff from year to year. For in-
stance Editor Ackerman was the

only one on the staff this year

who had worked on it to any
degree last year.

The duality of the magazine
will have to continue unless—
as some have suggested—there
is an increase in student.fees to
allow the organization of a
separate literary magazine
which would permit Seripts and
Pranks to concentrate exclu-
sively on humour. I would be
against this because I believe
if properly handled, as it has
been this year, humorous and
literary works can make for a
much better magazine than one
which concentrates exclusively
on one or the other. The mistake
in the past—which Ackerman
has eliminated this year—is to
bring out one issue dedicated to
humour and another completely
literary. .

As to the personality of the
magazine, | would tike to see
a development of the continu-
ity which hes been started
this year. Things like a stan-
dardized masthead, a column
by the editor and continuing

features such as “What Kind
of a Man Reads ‘Scripts and
Pranks’ can give students a
sense of reading a new issue
of the same magazine rather
than a different magazine
every time we publish.

The staff situation will not be
as bad this year as it was last
because there are several regu-
lars who will be back next year
and a few rising sophomores
who will possibly join the staff.
I would like to see the staff be-
come definite rather than the
nebulous group which has here-
tofore written Seripts and

Pranks and the best way is by.

which to feel a pride of mem-

already made this year. bership—a =< magazine.

fraternity after-parties.

These parties were the subject
of discussions this week between
members of the Faculty Com-
mitt on Fraternities, Clubs, and
Social ‘Life and the individual:
fraternities. The committee
plans to complete its visits to
the individual fraternity houses
next week.

Prof. W. G. Workman, Prof.
S. D. Maloney, and Gus Burg-
dorf outlined the committee's
position Tuesday evening at
the Sigma Nu house.

McGavock explained the com-
mittee position as a pragmatic
compromise between the col-
lege’s principle of opposition to
drinking and its knowledge that
there are numerous violations
of the rule.

“We realize that in many re-
spects the stand is inconsistent,”
McGavock admitted. “But it is
not hypocritical nor does it
represent a failure to under-
stand the students. It is the best
possible compromise under the
circumstances.”

McGavock traced the evolu-
tion of the after-dance party
from what he described as
“often-time drunken brawls”
of the late 40's and early 50’s
to the present parties.

He noted that the college rule
was modified several years ago
to remove the restriction which
prohibited students from such
things as drinking in their own
homes away from Davidson. “We
realized at the time a push for
further modifications would
come,” he commented.

ty Council concert of the year will headline the Letter-
g tomorrow evening at 8, followed by the controversial

alternatives according to Mce-
Gavock. First, the college could
police tne present rule to put
real teeth in it. But this is not
done because it would merely
drive the parties underground.

Secondly, the college could
abolish the rule. McGavock
made plain that hopes for this
are unrealistic. “I believe a
vast majority would affirm to
carry the rule on in principte,”
he told his listeners.

‘Finally, we can attempt to
live with the rule, not policing
it intensively although we know
violations exist.” This final pos-
sibility represents the present
position.

Where the college's respon-
sibility begins and ends was a
question McGavock was reluc-
tant to answer precisely. “The
faculty has certain beliefs in
principle that the students.are
expected to live by,”. he com-
mented. But he stated that the
committee cannot maintain its
principles and also give fraterni-
ties permission to hold off-
campus cocktail parties or any
other functions where it is
known there will be drinking.

The rule as seen by the
committee has a deterrent ef-
fect on excessive drinking. As

tong as there ere no com-

plaints to the committee, no
action will be taken. But if
irrefutable evidence of drink-
ing is brought to the commit-
tee, disciplinary action would
definitely be taken by the
college.

“This position represents the
maximum retreat possible for
the committee,” McGavock em-
phasized. “If we back down any
more there would eventually be
pressure to allow drinking on
campus.”

Recognizing 1 conflict be-
tween the widespread social ac-
ceptance of drinking and the
college’s principle, McGavock
made a prediction. “If social
mores continue to evolve in the
present direction, we may be-
come an oasis in the desert.
(“A desert in the oasis,” Ma-
loney corrected.) Then the
drinking rule may evolve,” Mc-
Gavock continued. “It appears
we are fighting a losing battle,
but we are opposed to drinking
in principle,” he concluded.

The Lettermen are a trio who
have produced numerous popu-
lar songs in the last two years.
Following the concert will be
the traditional off-campus after-

parties by the individual frater- :

nities.
