Inconsistency plagues Wildcats

By STAN HALES
Staff Writer
That plague of inexperi-
enced teams, inconsistency,
has once again infected the

Davidson Wildcat basketball .

team, resulting in four consec-
utive losses and seven losses
in their last eight games.

A wide range of problems
have hurt the Cats, from poor:
shooting and defensive break-
downs to lack of rebounding
and crippling turnovers.

During Christmas break,

over which the Cats dropped -

games to Brigham Young,
Ohio State, and New Hamp-

shire, the only highlight was
in the Cats win over Brown
University in the consolation’
game of the Charlotte Invita-
tional Tournament, with
freshman Ernie Riegel getting
23 points, 9 rebounds, and 7
assists.

After an away loss to the
Virginia Cavaliers, the Cats
hosted the Duke Blue Devils
at the Coliseum in what can be
regarded as anything other
than a basketball game.

Beset by just about every

problem imaginable, Davidson
was never really in the game.
Again, the Cats went through

Walters returns as
Dartmouth coach

By MARK SCANDLING
Staff Writer

Gary Walters returns to the
Davidson area this Saturday
night. Coming with him are
the Big Green of Dartmouth
College, who are currently
sporting a 1-9 record.

Walters has previously been
to Charlotte Coliseum as a
player on the Bill Bradley
Princeton teams in the mid-
’60’s, and then last spring as
the man chosen to succeed Bo
Brickels as head basketball
coach at. Davidson.

Within a few weeks of
taking the Davidson position,
Walters announced one morn-
ing that his ‘‘Conscience’’ was
forcing him to return to Dart-
mouth, and honor his contract
there.

His return to Dartmouth
has not been a triumphant
one. Last year the Big Green
finished third in the Ivy
League with a 16-10 record,
and Walters was voted Coach
of the Year. This year with
two second team Ivy League
starters back on the squad,
Dartmouth is 1-9.

The team’s leading scorer of
a year ago Larry Cubas is
back. Last year he averaged
16.5 points per game from his
guard position.

Playing the pivot is the
other all-conference selection,
Sterling Edmonds. Edmonds
stands 6’7’’, and averaged
15.2 points per game last year.

The Big Green plays the
same style of basketball as
Davidson, slow and delibe-

rate. They feature a ‘‘delibe-

rate offense and a disciplined
defense.’’ Their defense was
ranked 13th in the nation last

points per game.

Walters was not expecting
to repent his success of last
season, this year. Commen-
ting on his 1976-77 team he
said, ‘‘We lack depth and
speed, and we play an extre-
mely ambitious schedule.’’
Thus for this season, his team
has not been able to overcome
these obstacles.

The Wildcats have had pro-
blems overcoming this same
obstacles, also. In many
games the Cats have been
outmanned, but against Dart-
mouth the matchups are fairly
equal. Saturday night’s game
will provide the Cats with an
excellent chance for a long
awaited big victory.

several scoring droughts
throughout the game inclu-
ding the last 12 minutes.

Second half shooting was a
miserable 3 of 33 goals from
the field. The game percentage
was around 28 percent. John
Gerdy led the Cats with 26
points, 22 coming in the first
half.

For Duke, gunning guards
Tate Armstrong and Jim
Spanarkel added 25 and 17
points respectively. Impres-
sive in the middle was fresh-
man Mark Gminski, destined
far even greater performances
than his 14 points, 12 re-
bounds, and 9 blocked shots
against Davidson. Needless to
say, he intimidated whatever
there was of the Cats inside
game as Duke rolled to a
102-51 victory.

Against Furman, scoring
droughts ruined all Wildcat
chances of an upset, and
turnovers crippled the few
rallies the home team could
mount.

However, the Cats did play
excellent defense against the
Palladins, holding Southern
Conference leading scorer Jon-
athan Moore to 14 points and
All-Southern Conference cen-
ter Jim Strickland to 10.

It was guard Bruce Grim
who did the damage scoring 21
points mostly on long jump
shots, enabling the Palladins
to win 69-58.

with East Carolina at Johns-
ton Gym, it looked like the

Cats might blow the visitors
out, but another long dry spell
of 7 minutes without a field
goal put ECU ahead 32-22 at
the half.

The Cats poured it on early

in the second half to make a
game of it, outscoring ECU
15-6. However costly mistakes
and questionable officiating
helped the Pirates to their
51-49 win.

Hawaiian Islands refresh Ta-Tas
while intramural action snowed under

By THE BODACIOUS

Staff Writers

Upon returning from the
Hawaiian Islands last night,
where we had wined and d
for three’ weeks, we were
terrified to discover that 287
IMAC basketball games had

‘ been played since our last-

column.

We would like you to know
that the snow was unbeliev-
able in Hawaii, and are sorry
we: could not bestow our
presence on campus before last
night due to the. aforemen-
tioned snow.

We would like to inform you

-of the outstanding highlights
of the recent past. First

Henderson House, 19-4. which
had been paced by Susan
Reid’s four points. This game
was played last year.

Mike “B.T.”’ Jones scored
his first point since his soph-
omore year while his team-
mate Ken ‘‘Nowhere’”’ Nor-
wood hit an impressive four of
26 from the floor in leading

B.T. Express to a 21-19 defeat
at the hands of First Richar-
dson and the last second shot
of Scott MacConomy.

Eddie ‘‘Gimme the Ball’’
Nicholson was six of 889 from
the floor for a paltry 12 points
in guiding Acme Basketball
over Smasher Stomatopods
despite the. knuckle-gnashing,

fist-smashing effort of Gary
Hart, who failed to contribute
a point.

In a more exciting, stimul-
ating game, during which the
stands were full of raving,
maniacal fans, the Whizz Kids
dissembled Five Easy Pieces,
46-45. It was a double over-
time contest. As if that was

not exciting enough, Bob
“Right-Left’’ Clarkson prov-
ided a half-time show that
caused one spectator to com-

ment ‘‘Yech’’.

Next week: Our endeavors
will be to give you an idea of
how the teams are faring and
which teams are leading the

league.
