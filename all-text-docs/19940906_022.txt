FROM THE EDITOR

MERIDETH DURDEN DOLAN, 1979

Memories

to eat

of The

I was editor

‘Davdisonian in 1979, the low- |

tech, full-fat days. I can’t re-
member many of the campus is-
sues from that time, but I remem-
ber everything we ate:

Enormous Fritos (“big
enough to dip”)-out of crackly
orange bags during our weekly
meetings in that airy attic confer-
ence room;

New Ranch-Style Fritos as
we proofread in that dank base-
ment office, pigging out with a
wonderful proofreader called
Aida Doss. She could spot a typo
30 feet away (and a dip-sized
chip from ten);

MIcrowaved apple danish at
8 a.m. as we sat in the snack bar,
lamenting the lack of ads with the
business staff. Microwave cook-
ing was fairly new—if you didn’t
eat your danish quickly, it coagu-
lated into a stiff mess; so-we ate
quickly;

Frosted Pop Tarts with the
sports staff, all knobby knees,
active verbs and furor over
Furman’s win as we sat on the
common and discussed the sports
section;

Cheesecake off white paper
plates at the Peregrine House.
Patsy Daniels (as Patricia D.
Cornwell was then called) was a
waitress there and a features edi-
tor at The Davidsonian. Together,

cheesecake and tried to decide if
anybody actually read the poetry
inserts.

The content of the paper es-
capes me, but the process doesn’t.
The meetings in hot, high rooms,
the proofing in low, dark ones,
endless sessions in that editorial
office with the one great window
and low-tech layouts using hot wax.
We all wanted the same thing: to
WRITE and BE READ. We
wanted to have our thoughts

‘beamed out across campus and

shone back at us.

In those high-fat, full-volume
days, we listened to so much Bruce
Springsteen all night that we had to
play Jethro Tull during the day just

‘to stay awake (most music played

on our eight track tape player.)

“Yes, I could drink a case of
you and still be on my feet,” sang
Joni Mitchell. But in those days,
long before low alcohol beer and
Jolt Cola, it was a case of Dr.
Pepper. Plain old, single S.K.U.
Dr. Pepper. Full of caffeine and
sugar and memories.

Now, I live in London and
drink herbal tea while I manage an

international ‘sales force. I’m at

home with my fax and my three]

children most of the:month, but I
make monthly sojourns to Paris to
work with my people there. I find
I’m living two lives (professional
and personal), wearing two ward-
robes (one silk and one silly), but
I’m doing the same thing in both
worlds. I’m building self-esteem
in the women I work with and
creating it in my kids. That’s
what I do.

And The Davidsonian. Well,
I enjoyed being editor, working
with people, meeting deadlines,
smelling. the fresh stacks of pa-
pers as they were delivered to all
the dorms. And I’m sure the ex-
perience of being editor helped
me get into Harvard Business
School.

But most likely its a memory,
a fading food fantasy: of Lucky
Charms right out of the box and
M&Ms straight out of the bag.
And a bunch of fellow revellers, I
mean writers, consuming and cre-
ating and hoping to be fed. And
read.

We were.

Moving into
the big leagues

By William Robert

The period from the mid-
1970's to the mid-1980's was a
time of internal reorganization and
growth, as Davidson adapted to
the multitude of changes from the
previous decade and transformed
itself from a small southern school
to a national-caliber liberal arts
college.

The first step in this metamor-
phosis was the opening of the new
E. H. Little library for the 1974-
1975 school year. This gave stu-
dents an expanded, up-fo-date place
to research and study. The Grey
Student Union was opened a year
later to provide students with a
casual place to relax and congre-
gate for study breaks.

Davidson increased its na-
tional exposure by offering the first

for the first time that fall. In Octo-
ber of 1980, Kimmel House be-
came a women’s center for two
years. A Davidson woman, Eliza-
beth Kiss, was awarded a Rhodes
scholarship for the first time in the
winter of 1983, and that fall, the
Phi Society changed its 140-year-
old policy and admitted women
for the first time.

Davidson continued its inter-
nal institutional restructuring and
growth. The faculty defeated a
measure to implement the equiva-
lent of a cultural diversity require-
ment in December of 1977 and
adopted its new code of professo-
rial evaluation four months later.
WDAV moved.from a student-run
to a classical station in the fall of
1978, and following students pro-
tests over the change, the entire

The late 1970's witnessed a
multitude of firsts that made
Davidson a school of national caliber.

July Experience program to rising
high school seniors in 1976. Stu-
dents demonstrated their support
for national exposure when they:

protested the cancellation of the —

Davidson National Print and Paint
Competition in the spring of 1976.
In December of that year, an en-
dowment created the Stuart schol-
arships to attract students with out-
standing academic and leadership
abilities.

Women continued to find and.

define their roles at Davidson. In
the fall of 1976, Davidson hired
Susan Roberts to be its first full-
time coach dedicated exclusively
to women’s athletics. That same
year, Catherine Landis became the
first woman elected to edit The
Davidsonian. Rusk, the first
women’ s eating house, was opened
in the spring of 1977 with 46 mem-
bers, and Cannon housed women

student staff resigned within two
weeks. Hobart Park, the college’s
literary magazine, was also estab-
lished that fall. The honor pledge
was codified into its current form
in October of 1979. In September
of 1981, Irwin and Knox com-
pleted the trio of “down the hill”
dormitories, and Vail Commons
began serving students.

The most consequential
change of this period’ came in 1983
when Dr. Samuel Spencer resigned
as president of Davidson College
after leading it through the most
metamorphic decade of this cen-
tury. The following February,
Davidson announced the approval
of Dr, John Kuykendall as the next
president of the college. He would
lead the transformed Davidson,
ushering it into a period of national
academic prominence and com-
petitiveness.
