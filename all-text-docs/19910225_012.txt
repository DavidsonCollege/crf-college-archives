THE DAVIDSONIAN CAMPUS LIVING Mmonpay, FEBRUARY 25, 1991

Spending The Day With Writer Margaret Atwood

By Jennifer Sieck

I had the great privilege on
Monday, February 18 to spend
several hours with Margaret
Atwood. I ate lunch with her, lis-
tened to her speak in the afternoon
at the 900 Room during an infor-
mal question and answer session,
and attended her reading in the
evening at Love Auditorium. |
enjoyed my day thoroughly.

She told great stories, most of
which were very funny. At lunch,
one of her first stories was about a
college roommate at Harvard who
had a pet iguana.

Mid-year, her roommate left
to cohabitate with her boyfriend,
leaving the iguana with Atwood.
The iguana lived quite happily in
the closet on a diet of lettuce.

However, sometimes when
Atwood let the iguana out, it went
under the bed which was bolted to
the floor and Atwood could not
reach it.

This was a problem as an eld-

erly woman with a heart condition
swept the room each day. Atwood
said she was afraid the woman
would literally die if she saw an
creature looking half-dragon, half-
lizard under the bed.
So, Atwood made a sculpture

An anecdote of a more serious
tone resulted from a question a
studentonce asked Atwood, which
was, “Should I go out and suffer so
that I can become a good writer?”
Her reply to the student was: “Don’t
worry--you will suffer. You don’t

You are the ones doing the work,
she said, not me. She spoke di-
rectly, yet with an unpretenious
eloquence.

Addressing diverse topics
ranging from specific questions
about her works to her perspective

Addressing diverse topics ranging from specific questions
about her works to her perspective on the gulf war to growing
up in the fifties to distinctions between Canada and the
United States, she was accessible and interesting to her lis-

teners.

of herself and put it in bed if she
wasn’t in the room and the iguana
was under the bed, along with a
sign saying “Do Not Disturb.”

This tale led to others recounted
by studentsas well as Atwood about
iguanas, other dangerous dorm
pets, and eventually onto different
and various subjects.

have to go out and look for suffer-
ing; it will come to you.”

I think that all of Atwood’s au-
diences on Monday were at ease
with her.

She told the people gathered in
the 900 Room that she understood
that they were supposed to ask her
questions and so to do just that.

Paul Simon Tour Stops In
North Carolina

By Tom Koonce

From his days with partner Art
Garfunkel, Paul Simon has made
legions of fans while having nu-
merous hit songs. Now, touring
after the release of his “Rhythm of
the Saints” album under the ‘Born
at the Right Time’ tour, Simon has
added another generation to his list
of followers.

The tour stopped at the Smith
Center in Chapel Hill on an early
February Sunday night. The crowd
who gathered for this concert
ranged from college and high
school students to adults in their
forties or fifties.

The concert started with the
Brazilian beat of “The Obvious
Child” off of his new album. This
was followed by the African
rhythm of “The Boy in the Bubble”
off of “Graceland.”

These rhythms were heard
throughout the night, with the
Brazilian beat evident in almost
every song. Simon had over sev-
enteen people in his band, most of
them musicians from Brazil and
Africa. PS
This Brazilian musical sound

led Simon to completely redo some
of his older songs suchas “Cecilia”
and“Kodachrome.” Thisapproach
was done really well and gave these
songs a fresh new twist.

This concert did not have any
spectacular stage or any special
effects. It was all music.

Simon went back and forth
through time, playing old songs
such as “Bridge-Over Troubled
Water” and “Still Crazy After All
these Years” and then going to his
recent albums with songs such as
“I Know What I Know,”
“Graceland,” and “Born at the
Right Time.”

Since many in the audience
were past their college concert-
going days, much of the crowd
remained seated for the night,
except for two sections by the side
of the stage which danced to every
song.

Simon decided to dedicate a
song to these dancers, and it was
the right choice. As soon as the
first chords of “You Can Call Me
Al” were played, the whole coli-
seum crowd jumped.to their feet.
Noticing the Enthusiasm, Simon
decided to repeat the same. song

over again, to the ultimate approval
of everyone in the audience.

After playing the African beat
of “Diamonds on the Soles of Her
Shoes,” which had a great gospel
touch of three background singers,
most of the last songs of the night
were done by Simon and only a

‘few other musicians.

These included old favorites
such as “The Boxer,” “American
Tune,” and “Hearts and. Bones.”
These songs were not heavily in-
fluenced by any African or Brazil-
ian rhythm. $

Simon simply sang them as he
has all these years, and the effect
was not lost at this concert as the
crowd was extremely quiet, obvi-
ously captivated by his moving
vocals.

Simon closed the night with
the predictable “Sound of Silence.”
This song was as touching as ever
and it was an excellentending toan
already exceptional concert.
Watching Paul Simon alone on the
stage taking bows at the conclu-
sion, one could easily realize that
they had just seen the performance
ofa true legend, whois not near the
end of his musical career.

on the gulf war to growing up in the
fifties to distinctions between
Canada and the United States, she
was accessible and interesting to
her listeners.

As I read back over apiece that
she read, “What Is a Woman’s
Novel?”, my appreciation for the
text was missing a dimension not

hearing it, especially after having
heard it read by Atwood herself.
Atwood commented that writing
should be as much or more for the
listener as for the reader, compar-
ing a text to musical notes on a
page. Writing, like music, she
believes, cannot be fully realized
until heard.

Atwood’s reading exemplified

- her philosophy.

I laughed again as I read, re-
membering Atwood’s pace and in-
flection.

I could continue, as over and
over during the day I laughed, con-
templated, was delighted, and
learned much from Margaret
Atwood.

Iowe Atwood’s daughter spe-
cial thanks because her decision to
remain in Charlotte instead of
coming to Davidson enabled me to
have lunch with Atwood. I look
forward to reading more of
Atwood’s works, with changed
eyes and ears.
