Last Tuesday, all academic
departments voted individually on
the issue of minors.

As aresult of these votes, the
Economics, Spanish, and German/
Russian departments will now add
the option of minors to their cur-
riculums.

These. three subjects join the
Music and French departments as
the only departments that have
adopted minors.

Last April, the Council on
Academic Affairs’ efforts to bring
the option of minors to Davidson
were rewarded.

In a vote that surprised many,
faculty members decided to allow
each individual department to de-
cide on the issue of minors.

This year, five of Davidson’s
19 academic departments now of-

fer the option.
Professor Malcolm Partin,
-» Chair ofthe History: Department: .
and Secretary of Faculty, states
that the’ History department has

decided to wait on offering a His-

tory minor.

The English department has
also chosen to postpone voting and
proceed slowly. Professor Cynthia
Lewis, Chair of the English de-
partment, says, “The motive for
having minors is to attract stu-
dents, and in relation to the num-
ber of students we teach every year,
we feel hard-pressed already to
meet the demand.”

Liz Abernethy, Chair of the
Council on Academic Affairs, re-
ports that in order to preserve uni-
formity, some professors feel that
if one department offers minors,
all should.

Abernathy says, “Our depart-
ment will continue to monitor the
process of minors and look into
other issues such as the addition of
new concentrations.”

In arandom departmental poll
taken last spring by The
Davidsonian, the Philosophy, Edu-
cation, Classics, and Chemistry de-
partments expressed interest in
offering a minor, although they
had not reached formal conclu-
sions on the matter.

The Council on Academic Af-
fairs remains hopeful that other
departments will soon add the op-

Students plagued by on-cam-
pus parking woes this year aren’t
the only ones complaining.

Last week marked the town of
Davidson’s first attempt to relieve
the downtown area’s parking
crunch. However, according to
merchants and residents, the town’s
new parking solution has proved
to be another headache.

On Wednesday, the Davidson
Police Department began enforc-
ing the town’s new Main Street
parking regulations, developed by
Town Administrator Leamon
Brice. According to Brice’s new
parking policy, Main Street park-
ing northbound from Concord
Road to Griffith Street and south-
bound from Griffith to Depot Street
is restricted during business hours

to Davidson merchants and their
employees so the spaces in front of
shops are left open. Anyone else,
including students and employees
of the college, downtown shop-
pers, and visitors, will be towed.

Merchants have long com-
plained about insufficient parking
spaces. The spaces which did exist
along Main Street, they said, were
often filled by college students and
employees, as well as shoppers,
leaving merchants and employees
with no place to park.

Brice says the new policy is a
response to such complaints. The
policy, he says, “was a genuine
attempt to make spaces available
for people to park in all day.”

However, just days after its
implementation, the majority of
reaction to the parking regulations
seems to be negative. For the past

would therefore not be in sync with the Union’s mission “to do

harmful in terms of self-image and self-esteem,” says Union

Video Committee andDCTV chair John Blake ’98 thought a Davidson version of the MTV dating game

Last year the game-winning
field goal split the uprights, giving
Guilford a 31-28 win over
Davidson on the last play.

This year, the tying bid fell
short and wide right, as the re-
vamped Wildcats (2-2) secured a

‘stirring 13-10 victory and won their

second game, something they were
unable to accomplish last season.

“We've always played teams
real tough and used to come up on

the short end,” said defensive end
Ben Spivey,-who had two sacks
and a blocked punt...

“That’s the way it’s been
around here for a long time. But I
think we took it into our own
hands today and tried to make the
breaks go our way.”

After the Quakers’ Kris
Radecki notched a 25-yard field
goal on the game’s opening pos-
session, Davidson countered with
a Matt Strader 1-yard touchdown
plunge.
