Eager to cash in on a good thing, Editor yonn
Todd. victimized by the fact that no one ever reads
his editorials, approached me early this week and
requested that he might write one column under the
heading Behind the Lockers.

Realizing my reputation to be at stake, I take
this chance nevertheless to tell the world, this col-
umnis...

BY JOHN TODD

“Duke is a really fine basketball team,” philo-
sophized UCLA Coach Johnny Wooden rather mat-
ter-of-factly to a group of reporters huddled around
him last Saturday night in the Charlotte. Coliseum,

“«, and I don’t think’ we are.”

Wooden’s defending national champions had
just been picked apart for the second conseutive
night by an amazing exhibition. of hardwood prowess
put on by the Blue Devils.

After taking the measure of the Bruins, 82-66,
in their owm Indoor Stadium Friday night, the Blue
Devils brought their victims into Davidson’s back-
yard and treated Charlotte fans to a 94-75 clean-up
job.

Coliseum manager Paul Buck adeptly covered
up his new red and black “DC” in the center Jump
circle, as the enviable Devils from Durham topped
anything that Davidson’s red and green Wildcats, or
any quintet for that matter, can throw at the fair-
weather Queen City supporters this year.

UCLA’s famed zone press, which Sports Ulust-
rated had recently tabbed as the defense that panics
them all, was so calmly handled by Duke that it’s
hard to believe that the system ever made the head-
lines, much less two consecutive national champion-
ships.

Sandy-haired Wooden, almost looking the part
of a defeated coach who knew it was coming, was
coolly analyzing what he had just witnessed, while
the Blue Devil band staged a post-game victory
concert outside on the Coliseum floor.

“Defense is a matter of personnel,” he pointed
out, “and the press is a defense that takes quick-
ness.

Duke just doesn’t lose its poise, Wooden ‘said,
and that was the story of the game.

AN INCIDENTAL GUEST

Davidsen-bound Charlie Scott, incidentally,
watched the game from behind the Bruin bench.

Wooden, asked if UCLA’s pre-season licking at
the hands of their freshmen team led by Scott's
former teammate, Lew Alcindor, was an omen of
things to come, acidulously replied, “Any team plays
poorly away from home.”

Glancing across the press room, he added,
“Look what happened at South Carolina.”

SIPPING ON A COKE

He happened to be looking at a quiet redhead
who was sitting ten feet away sipping on a Coke.
The young business-type was Duke’s Vic Bubas.

“Tll_ tell you what I told the team after the
game.” said the Blue Devil boss. “They learned to
play as a team and not as individuals out there.”

It-was undoubtedly true. At one point late in
the first half on a fast break, Devilish Bob Verga
sailed downcourt on a two-on-one. Suspended in
mid-air under the basket with a Bruin defender,
Verga flashed a behind-the-back pass to teammate
Jack Marin, who dropped the two-pointer with the

greatest of ease, with a tremendous roar of approval
from the sellout crowd.

Mike Lewis, a Baby Huey-type Montanan who
hardly plays like a sophomore should, yet is a
monster on both boards; Bob Riedy, with an off-the-
court grin so wide it almost flattens his face; and
Steve Vacendak, a <uave floor-leader and terrific
competitor, are only the beginning five of quite a

roundball machine.

Someone on campus remarked over the week-
end, “Lefty’s smarter than ever to avoid Duke on the
schedule this year.” Whether intentional or not, the

absence of Duke on this

year’s slate is some boon

to the embarassingly green ’Cats.

HARDLY ANY PROSPECT

Will Davidson ever schedule Duke again? An
athletic department spokesman gave no hint of any
such plans, and instead remarked that there was
hardly any prospect of such a meeting in the near

future.

Meanwhile, Wildcat fans can keep on swallow-
ing this year’s lumpy and unstable medicine from
Johnston Gym and resign themselves to watching
the Blue Devils romp from now until March.

At least the winter will pass faster that way.

Swimmers Down
CitadelFish, 58-46

After trouncing The Citadel, 58-46, in their first con-
ference meet held in Charleston Saturday, the hopeful
Wildcat Mermen prepare to take on their second Atlantic
Coast Conference foe of the young season, Wake Forest,

tomorrow.
Co-captain Jim Stokes will

be missing in tomorrow's match
with the ‘‘Wakie Wetties.”
Stokes journeys to Florida to
face somewhat different type of
competition as he will be inter-
viewed by the Rhodes scholar-
ship comimttee.

“With Stokes here we'd be
sure winners,’ promised sopho-
more swimming star Tom Irons

“It’s going to be close now.
We need depth, that’s our big
weakness. Still, we've got a dog-
gone good chance to win it.”

The Citadel match was not
as close as the score indicates.
Going into the last event, a relay
worth seven points, the ‘Cats
held a slim five point lead.
Stokes, Irons, John Helm and
Bris Rodgers won the event by
one foot, thus assuring the ‘Cats

of their 12 point victory.

“You might say Gary Peklo
won the 500-yard free-style,"’
Trons went on. “Since he lost
to that... girl. . . last week!"’

Rodgers won the 50-yard free-
style, and his teammate Helm
took second.

Irons won the 100 and 200-
yard free-styles to further pad
the ‘Cats win.

Perhaps one of the biggest dis-
appointments for Davidson's
fishmen was Jim Stokes’ defeat

‘in his specialty, the butterfly.

Again interviews interrupted the
swimming team's plans for
Stokes as he was forced to fly
straight to Charleston from New
Orleans, and the Marshall Scho)-
arship interviews, and to swim
without sleep much of the night
before.

the Pirates almost caught up

Davidson’s highly touted freshmen streaked to
a 102-74 victory over an outclassed North Greenville

squad besore stumbling over their notices in enemy -

territory. The trouncing came Tuesday night at the
hands of Duke’s Blue Imps, who halted the Wildkit-
tens’ win streak at five games.

_ The freshmen entertained the North Greenville
quintet on Saturday night in Johnston Gym, hustling
and gunning their way to an impressive showing.
Mike Spann and Dave Moser created the offensive
sparks, tallying 27 and 29 points respectively. Strong
rebounding and good ballhandling helped pave the
road to victory.

However, away from home for the first time,
the frosh saw their record tarnished by a score of
107-85. Their usual steady ballhandling was dis-
rupted by some quick ballhawks, while the Imps’ big
men dominated the boards. Mike Dickens, express-
ing the squad’s feelings, said, “They were really
strong and quick, but we didn’t play like ourselves.
We should do better against them the next time.”

Larry Dempsey and Barney Smith, with 19 and
17 points respectively, led an Imp squad which
placed seven men in double figures. Davidson’s five
starters all hit for more than ten points, paced by
Wayne Huckel’s 19. Spann and Rocky Crosswhite
chipped in with 18 and 17 points apiece.

This contest concluded the freshmen’s pre-
Christmas activity. They open after the holidays
with Furman, Jan. 1, at the Charlotte Coliseum
against Ferrum Junior College.
