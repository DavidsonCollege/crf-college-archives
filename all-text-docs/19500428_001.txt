VOLUME XXXVIII

MASQUERS CLOSE

‘THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER’

The bewhiskered figure in the wheelchair slowly surveys
the attentive group surrounding him, and announces:

‘I may vomit.”’ ;
Thus Sheridan Whitesides,

egomaniac, makes his entrance

and starts a flow of vitrolic comments that run rampant through-

out the course of “The Man Who
Came to Dinner,” to be presented
in Chambers Auditorium, next
Thursday and Friday at 8:15 p. m.

Mr. Whitesides, ably played by
Bill Trotman will dominate the
action in the Hart and Kaufman
satire but there are others who
will come in for their share of at-
tention.

tor laughs, Vance Mizelle and
Howard Proctor, comedy team
from the late “Foolies” have minor
but very effective roles. Mizelle is
the world’s greatest authority on
the cockroach, making a gift of
ten thousand of them to Mr. White-
sides,

Howard Proctor is well suited for
the part of Beverly Carlton, tweedy
Englishman, who “cheerios” his
way along in typical blimey.

Dorothy Herring adds a touch
of sophistication as she plays the
long-suffering Maggie and matches

Whiteside’s sarcasm tit for tat.
- Mary .Wells McNeil after playing
nurse to the noted author is driven
to quit the nursing profession, de-
claring:

“If Florence Nightingale had ev-
er nursed Sheridan Whitesides,
she'd have married Jack the Rip-
per, instead of founding the Red
Cross.”

Bill Pharr and Mrs. Ruth Henge-
veld as Mr. and Mrs. Stanley come
in for the brunt of the attack as
their home is taken over by the
inimitable “Sherry.”

They not only subject to an enor-
mous lawsuit, but are forced to see
their home turned into a guest
home for Whitesides and company,
plus escaped convicts, Chinese stu-
dents, an octopus, penguins from
Admira] Byrd’s Arctic expedition,
and a mummy from an Egyptian
Khediva.

Not even their children escape
Whiteside’s touch. He influences
Richard and June Stanley to run
away, bent for matrimony, and to
make his stay a totally unpopular
one he-tries to steal the Stanley
cook when he leaves.

Mary McGill, local high school
student, will play June Stanley in-
stead of Jesse Carter as originally
announced.

Ed Parker heads the stage crew
for this last Masquer’s play. Prof.
Erwin is in charge of the set con-
struction and will also act the part
of Dr. Bradley.

Mr, Whitesides is the Kaufman
-Hart takeoff on Alexander Wool-
cott, with Beverly Carlton the coun-
terpart of Noel Coward, and Lor-
raine Sheldon (played “by Ellen
Thigpen) the image of Gertrude
Lawrence.

Twin Pianists Give
Concert In Chapel

Ernest and Miles Mauney, iden-
tical twin sons of Mr. and Mrs. W.
K. Mauney of King’s Mountain,
North Carolina, were guest artists
at Davidson's chapel program of
April 24 which was held, naturally,
in the college's Chamber's Audi-
torium. The Messrs. Mauney play-
ed, for their two piano concert:
Tarentelle from a Rachmaninoff
suite; Artist’s Life by Strauss; and
Scherzoby Saint-Saems. The ap-
plause was loud and long, and the
Mauney brothers would have play-
ed a second encore had not the
time alloted for the chapel program
elapsed.

The two Mauneys showed an in-
terest in music at a very early age.
When nine years old they began
-studying with Miss Virginia Par-
sons of King’s Mountain, now Mrs.
Ivan Rosenthal of Pleasantville,
New Jersey. At fourteen they be-
came the pupils of Miss Dorothy
Baldwin of Charlotte, and Mark
Hoffman of the North Carolina Wo-
man’s -' College, making periodic
trips tq Greensboro for lessons. At
the Juilliard School of Music in
New York, where they spent the
summers of 1939 and 1940, they
were taught by Arthur Newstead.

Students Involved
In Frolics Wreck

mobile accident involving cars driv-
en by three Davidson students mar-
red the Spring Frolics week end

collar bone, occurred Friday after-
noon, April 21, at five p. m. three
miles south of Mocksville.

Three carloads of Davidson-
bound students ani dates en route
from Winston-Salem were involved
in the accident. A. K. Owen wap
driving the leading car when a
baseball from a roadside game broke
his windshield. Owen stopped to
investigate, signaling Bill Neal,
who was close behind, to stop also.

side of the road ahead of Owen.
Bob Gibson behind Neal was un-
able to stop, and his car sideswip-
ed the Buick. Gibson’s Pontiac hit
the rear fender of the Buick and
was scrapped down the right side
from the door to the rear fender.

In hitting ‘Neal’s car the right
door of the Pontiac was forced op-
en and Miss Scott thrown out,
breaking her collar bone. She was
tushed back to Winston-Salem for
treatment and is now recovering
satisfacto: ily.

Damages were estimated at $150
for Gibson’s car, $50 for Neal's,
and a windshield for Owen. Settle-
ment was mede at Magistrate's
court in Mocksville Saturday morn-
ing with no charges being made.

ed were Bob warray, passenger in

Walker Takes Honors

In Eumanean Contest

The Eumanean Literary Society's
mecting this week centered its at-
tention on a speaking contest held
among its new members and judg-
el by members of the faculty. The
judges panel consisting of Profes-
sors Boyd, Bauman, and Eberhardt,
selected Bob Walker of the Fresh-
man class as winner from among
six other contestants.

Using a passage taken from one
of Victor Hugo's compositions,
Walker showed a very powed ans
effective speaking manrer, combin-
ed with good enunciation and voice-
tone to completely hold audience's
attention as he vividly describ-
ed the horrifying thoughts and ac-
liens of a man caught in the death
yrasp of quicksand. His selection
was unanimously approved,

Other speakers and their topics
were Frank Wallace—"Non-Subsi
dation of the Basic Non-Agricultur-
al Industries’; Dave Moylan—
“Mercy Killing”; George Basen—
“The Brannan Agricultural Plan";
John Ottley—"A Christian View oi
Sexual Morality”; Pat McGeachy
—‘Why Are We Here?”; and Jenks
Jervey—"The Futility of Religion
Among Small Children.” Each of
these boys did a fine job of speak-
ing and the Eu Society feels very
fortunate, indeed, in having so many
good orators among its ranks.

After the contest, a motion was

LOFTIN, HUBBELL, GEER CHOSEN BUSINESS
MANAGERS FORPUBLICATIONS NEXT YEAR

Big’ busines is a’booming next
year. The Publication Board was
glad to announce, their appoint-
ments of next year’s business man-
agers for the Davidsonian, Scripts
& Pranks, and the Quips & Cranks.

John Loftin is in the saddle next
year as business manager of the
Davidsonian. Gene Geer takes the
seins for the Scripts & Pranks and
Bob Hubbel will hold the finances
of the Quips & Cranks well in the
middle of the road during the 1950-
Si year.

With their appointment the Pub-
lication Board extends to these new
leaders a vote of thanks for the im-
measurable amount of work done
this year in financing their publi-
cations, which was not only a yard-
stick of their past achievements but
an indication of success for the com-
ing year.

To be a business manager for
one of these publications is to in-
vite hours of toil, burdepsome re-
sponsibility, little recognition, and
a head of white hair. Hundreds of
dollars pass through the hands
of these men who plan, organize,
and budget the finances of their
publications. The trust which lies
in their hand is that of the student

body and the hondr is one which
