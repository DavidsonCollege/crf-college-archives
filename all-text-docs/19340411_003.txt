Talks At Vespers
On Ideals of Life

Speaker Urges That Lives Be

SPECIAL MUSIC HEARD

ducted by Students

Mr. M. D. Barrick, assistant pastor

the Myers Park Presbyterian
Church in Charlotte and Director of
Religious, Education of the Charlotte

Vesper ‘pn Sunday evening.
The program was conducted by Sid
Marsh and included a special number
by the Davidson quartet, composed of
Dave McLean, Frank Tucker, Hubert
Morris, and J. A. C. Robinson. Marsh
also led in a short prayer.

Mr, Barrick read the first Psalm,
which he called the story of a happy
and an unhappy man, for the scrip-
ture reading, and took as the theme
of his talk the parable of two men, one

where it was soon destroyed by the
and the other of whom
built his house upon rock, so that it
might withstand any tempest. He said
that all men are builders, building the

on which achievement is built.

The second requisite of the house of
life that its must open
outward. We must look out for others
as well as ourselves. This was illus-
trated by the of the Good
Samaritan. The philosophy of the rob-
bers who beat up the man and stole
goods was “What thine
mine.” The philosophy of the Levites
who saw the man in trouble and re-
fused to help him was “What is mine
is mine.” But the Good Samaritan
saw a man in trouble, and, although
they were racial enemies, he came to
his aid. His philosophy was “What is
mine is thine.” Our house should be
a refuge for all who need shelter.

Then the house must have plenty of
We need all the sunshine
and happiness we can get. “I have
never been able to see,” said Mr. Bar-
rick, “how a real Christian could go
“around with such a long face. I never
got the most out of life until I became
a Christian. I always figure that the
other fellow has plenty 6f worries
without telling him mine.”

The last and most important thing
that the house must have is daily com-
munion with God, God alone can give
us the guidance and help which we
need every day. When trouble comes,
it is to Him we must turn for comfort
and aid.

Mr. Barrick closed his talk by say-
ing, “The one thing I want you to
remember about this talk is that you,
and you alone, will have to live in the
house you build. Build it right.”

Sociology Head Speaks
To Ministerial Group

On Monday, April 9, Dr. Price H.
Gwynn, Jr., head of the sociology de-
partment, delivered an address before
the Ministerial Association of Char-
lotte. The title of his address was
“The Christian Home in a Changing
Social Order.”

Among other things Dr. Gwynn em-
phasized the opportunity now pre-
sented to the Church to help parents
in the solution of the perplexing prob-
lems of family adjustment. He stated
that the Christian home is threatened
by the steady secularization of mod-
ern life, and urged an intelligent fac-
ing of the issues by the religious lead-
ers.

“The next revival of religion should
start in the home,” stated Dr. Gwynn.
“Those of us who are parents should
live in the spirit of Jesus. We must
instruct our children in the principles
of His gospel and interpret His teach-
ings in terms of present-day problems.
We should teach our children the
Christian ideal of marriage and prepare
them for married life in the modern
world.”
