Driving drunk — Is it worth it?

By RAY THROWER

Every 24 hours someone’s
mother, father or child is killed by
a drunk driver in the United
States.

FACTS:

1) Half of all people involved in
automobile accidents have been
drinking.

2) An accident is three times more
likely after consuming one drink.
3) Most states consider you drunk
if your blood alcohol level is 0.10
percent (approx. 3-5 drinks per
hour). However safe limits are
often much lower. Blood alcohol
level of 0.03 percent can affect
your ability and judgment; lead
you to break the law or take un-
necessary risks.

It is estimated that 25,000
people will lose their lives each
year because of drunk drivers.
While approximately 1/2 million
more are injured, to say nothing of
the estimated 24 billion dollars in
economical losses.

It is said that on week night
one driver out of every 10 is
operating under the influence.

The Safe Roads Act of 1983
became effective Oct. 1, 1983 at
12:01 a.m. making it one of the
toughest laws in the United States.

The new law is designed to re-
duce plea bargaining and increase
punishment under a single charge
of D.W.I (@riving While Im-
paired). The new laws establish
five levels of penalties; ranging up
to two years in prison or a $2,000
dollar fine, based on mitigating
and aggravating factors present in
court.

D.W.I. can proven in one or
two ways: 1) By proving the
driver's physical or mental facul-
ties are appreciably impaired by
alcohol, drugs or a combination or
both OR 2) By-proving the drivers
alcoho! concentration is 0.10 per-
cent or more at any relevant time
after driving.

If an officer charges you with

D.W.1., he will ask you to take a
chemical test. Refusal to take any
required test will result in an im-
mediate revocation of your license
for at least 10 days and an addi-
tional 12 months revocation by the
Department of Motor Vehicles.

The present law raised the age
to buy and possess beer and unfor-
tified wine to 19, The legal age to
buy or possess fortified wine or
spirituous liquor remains 21.

The present law requires a one
year license revocation upon con-
viction if:

1. An underage person at-
tempts to purchase or purchases
an alcoholic beverage.

2. An underage person aids or
abets another to attempt to purch-
ase or purchases an alcoholic bev-
erage.

3. An underage person obtains
or attempts to obtain alcoholic
beverages by using or attempting
to use a fraudulent driver’s license
or other I.D. or another person's
driver license or I.D.

4. Any person permits his
driver's license or any other I.D.
to be used by an underage person
to purchase or attempt to purchase
an alcoholic beverage. If a provi-
sional licensee (age 16 or 17) is

convicted of the offense of driving
with any amount of alcohol or
drugs in his body, his license will
be revoked until 18 or for 45 days,
whichever is longer.

The new drinking age in North
Carolina will be 21 for all alcohol,
effective Sept. 1, 1986.

In addition to the fines, possi-
ble imprisonment and revocation
of driving privilege which the
court can and will impose on the
driver convicted of D.W.I., there
are other things that follow with
the charge. An individual could
lose their job, possibly be respon-
sible for taking the life of another
individual while under the influ-
ence and increase limits for auto-
mobile liability insurance when

they get their license reinstated.

A driver that carries the basic
limits required by the state of
N.C. with a single D.W.I. con-

victed will pay $640.69 more per
year than the driver without any
violations carrying the identical
coverages and this stays with them
for three years and affects their
