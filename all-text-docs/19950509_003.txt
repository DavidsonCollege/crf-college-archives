Chambers's chambermaids are men

By Another
investigative reporter

The legendary Chamber maids
who for eighty years have stood
mightily over Chambers lawn were
discovered Saturday to be men,
says a Startling Physical Plant re-
port released today.

The discovery was made Sat-

urday afternoon by retired Physi- ’

cal Plant worker known tohis com-
rades as “Old Flathead” after an
accident involving two milk jugs,
an anvil, anda leper. Old Flathead,
now a freelance statue cleaner, had
returned on special assignment to
wash the lovely ladies as part of the
college beautification project in-
spired by Carlton Pritchard’s an-
nouncement of plans to retire.

“Well, I was just scrubbin’ the
statue like I always do, and when I
got down around the statues crotch
area, I heard this giggling. It was
just the damnedest thing, ‘cause I
ignored it for a while, thinkin’ it
was just them voices in my head
talkin’ to me again.”

But Old Flathead was soon to
discover otherwise.

“After a few minutes, that
gigglin’ turned into full-fledged
laughter, and Icouldn’t believe my
eyes. The thing was lookin’ down
at me with a big smile on its face.
‘Idon’t think I’ m quite clean down
there, if you know what I mean,’ it
says to me. I near fell right off the
buildin’,” said Flathead.

“Well, I just couldn’t believe
my Own eyes, you know. And I
don’t, sometimes, like that time I
thought all them bowling balls was
severed human heads. That wasa
night, let me tell you.”

Later; Flathead remembered
what the hell he was talking about.

“Oh yeah. Well, I just had to
see if the thing was really alive, so
I peeled its robes back a little, and
damn if the thing didn’t have a
huge stone dong. Anda little drift-
wood in there, might I add.” The
Statue was unavailable for
comment.The Women’s Issues
Committee and the Board of Trust-

ees were called to a special joint
meeting Sunday to discuss what
action to take.

“This is just the kind of stereo-
typing that keeps women op-
pressed,” said Women’s Issues
Chairman Sarah Orsbon. “Just be-
cause a stone statue
wears a
dress, ev-
erybody as-
sumes it’s a
woman. I
think we
should call
the statues
“EO hee
Chamber
Dudes,’ or
‘The Chamber Misters.’
thing must be done.”

Trustee John Calvin replied,
“I don’t see what the problem is.
Obviously, a crazy old man had a
fantasy on top of Chambers, and
he’s not even a Presbyterian.”

Just kidding. Everyone knows
that John Calvin is dead.

The Commons aims to please, guarantees fun

By Jenn E. Wart

After The Davidsonian re-
ceived so much grief for the evalu-
ations of court house kitchens, The
Davidphonian staff saw it only fair
to evaluate the other food service
on the court, our own Vail Com-
mons. The results are shocking.
Despite receiving a high overall
rating, we discovered that all this
time the Commons have been lac-
ing the food with aphrodisiacs and
boy does this answer a lot of ques-
tions. The higher levels of sub-
stances are apparently in the all
new “alternative bar” and the yo-
gurtymachines. Not only will the
Commons food make you fat, but
horny too!

No wonder Davidson girls
hook up so much, acting like they
have years of frustration to let out,
as freshmen. Sophomore Carrie
Seymour said, “This explains so
much. Last year I ate there all the
time, and boy did I hook up a lot. I
mean all the time, with different
people, and this year I’ ve been ina
cold spell.”

The discovery has placed
Carlton Pritchard on his heels, be-
cause the obvious reason for the
inflated meal plans is aresult of the
use of expensive aphrodisiacs.

Toni Morrison denied admittance to

By Geraldo

Davidson junior and recent
Nobel Prize Winner Toni Morrison
was appalled Monday when she
received word that she was not
chosen to be a participant in the
1995 Davidson “Summer in Cam-
bridge” at Wolfson College.

“Tcouldn’t believe it. I got the
letter in the mail and it just said,
“Since you are a Junior you have
been put on the waiting list as an
alternate. The thirty other appli-
cants were just better than you.

“You know,our lounge sure is
locked a little too often during the
week now that I think about it,
maybe I'll try getting a meal plan
next semester,” said junior hall
counselor Shannon Lorance.

The use of these sexual en-
hancers is thought to possibly add
to the number of people eating
there next year, but not for every-
body.

“J don’t think I’m going to eat
there. I feel like I’m doing pretty
good as it is right now, I mean who
hasn't seen me at backstreet with
Louie O. Are you quoting this? I
must sound awful. Everyone is
going to gossip about me, or are
they already? Oh my!” said junior
Lexy Devane.

Apparently the cafeteria work-
ers have been getting a kick out of
this for some time. “I usually walk
around while the little boogers are
still eating so I can see how horny
they get, especially all those
Warner Hall girls and’KA .guys
that eat together all the time,” said
one worker who said she didn’t
have a name.

No wonder SAE didn’t mind
eating there with all of those good
looking (and apparently horny)
girls they were eating with that

Thank you for your enthusiasm.’
The first thing I did was brush my
teeth and cry.’”

Dr. Cynthia Lewis, Director
of the Program says, “Her GPA
was just not high enough. We had
to admit Sophomores with higher
GPA’s.”

Morrone best friend, senior
Maya Angelou syas, “I just can’t
believe a 2.775 isn’t high enough
for admittance. Toni is a bright
and capable woman and would be

whole time. Hell, with that as a
distraction, who could think about
rush and getting pledges.

“T’ve been eating down there
all semester and it hasn’t done me
any good. Maybe I should try eat-
ing more yogurt and reap the ben-
efits, being a SENIOR and every-
thing,” said a pensive Will Cobb.

a boon to the program. And those
sophomores. . . really.”

Operah Winfrey agrees, “I
don’t understand what is going on
at that school. Is Davidson truly a
place for individuals or is it a body
of statistics and probability? I
mean, think of the losers that got
in! That should tell you some-
thing. I think I'll do my next show

Regis and Kathy Lee.”

Most people would think this
would cause controversy, but most
people, including faculty and ad-
ministration, think the whole thing
is pretty funny and see no reason
forchange. Will Terry says he plans
on getting one himself, “Hell, I
don’t work for the college any-
more and I’m:single.”

Cambridge

When asked why her grades
were not up to par, Morrison whim-
pered, “I spent all of my time writ-
ing Sula. I know grades are prob-
ably a better indication of my ca-
pabilities, intellect, and personal
charm, but they could have at least
given me an interview.”

English Department Chair
Tony “two T’s” Abbott says, “She
was part of a very talented appli-
cant pool. Sometimes others get
overshadowed. Are you going to

Gill Holland quoted the Norton

‘I feel that I have no right to go
