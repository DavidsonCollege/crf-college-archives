DAVIDSON SUMMER SCHOOL.

The monotony of vacation quiet on
the campus was broken the first of Au-
gust by the opening of a two weeks’ ses-
sion of the Mecklenburg Summer Schoo!
or Teachers’ Institute.

The Davidson College plant has been
at the service of this school in previous
years ‘and the experiences incident to
such @ session are not new to cither the
town or a large fraction of those that
attended the Institute.

According to promise the enrollment
reached close to 190, more than 180
prospective teachers in the Mecklenburg
public schools being matriculates, as_re-
quired by the school law of the county.

The Institute was conducted by Prof.
J. Henry Highsmith, of the chair of
Education in Wake Forest. Instruction
in Primary class work was under the di-
rection of Miss Mary Arrington, for
merly assistant superintendent of educa-
tion in Franklin County.

Miss Mary O. Graham, of Charlotte.
assistant superintendent in Mecklenburg,
was present, having oversight of the ar-
rangements for the entertainment of the
school and giving general directions for
the smooth working out of the official
program. She gave instruction to classes
in: methods of reading and story telling.
Miss Bobbitt taught drawing. During
the session cf the school there were pres-
ent a number of visitors, several of
whom addressed the teachers in fectures
more or less formal. Among these were
Professor Sams. of Raleigh; Principal
John E. Rav. of the State-School for the
Blind and Deat; and Dr. T. M. McCon-
nell, who gave two highly informing
and instructive lectures on the present
European War.

stitute and morning chapel and other

The DAVIDSONIAN. August 23, 1915

hours were marked by sume -fine, even! +

inspirational rendering of standard

hymns and national songs and anthems. j

Social features were not neglected.
In the second week an elaborate program

under a class leader and “stunts” of a
varied character were “pulled off’ to
the amusement of a large audience as-
sembled in front of the west ‘portico of
the Library building. “he evening, as
far as the rain allowed, was brought to
a happy finish, or more strictly speaking.
the next evening was so rounded up, by
a water melon feast, the gift of young
men of the town, who in this way sought
to show their pleasure and interest in
the presence at Davidson of so many
young lady teachers.
