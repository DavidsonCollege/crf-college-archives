THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 30, 1930

Alumni From ‘13 States and
Forty-Five Classes Return

Former Students of College Re-
turned by Airplane, Motor and
Train for Annual Home-Com-

ing Celebration Saturday

CLASS OF 1930 LED

Members of 1866, 1871, 1876, and
1878 Classes on Campus—Three
Hundred Attend Luncheon

Davidson College alumni from 45 classes
and 13 different states last Saturday re-
turned for the annual Home-Coming cele-
bration of their Alma Mater. Classes repre-
sented extended from that of 1866 through
1932, and from 1895 through 1930 there
was an uninterrupted representation, for at
least one member of all the classes in be-
tween were at Davidson for the festivities.

Practically every known modern means
of conveyance was used by the returning
sons of Davidson. “Capt. Geo. H. Weems,
formerly R. O, T. C. commandant, but now
stationed at Langley Field, Va., returned by
airplane. A few used the train, but the ma-
jority came by motor. A few hours after the
exercises had concluded the most of the
alumni were en route to their various homes
throughout the continent, and their many
expressions of enjoyment were conclusive
proof that the day had been happily spent.

Many alumni, of course, arrived at David-
son only in time for the game, but those
on the campus early during the day and who
came by the alumni office to register ap-
proximated 200. The class of 1930 led in
registration with 18 members of the young-
est group of alumni putting their names in
the book. The class of 1912 had a dozen of
its men here; 1914 had 11; 1907 had eight,
and 1926, 1906 and 1899 were each tied
with. seven each. Had every alumnus regis-
tered, the list would perhaps have changed
slightly the classes which led.

Davidson was honored by the presence of
four of its older alumni. These included Gen.
W. A. Smith, ’66, of Ansonville, N. C., com-
mander of the North Carolina Confederate
Veterans, Who returned last fall for the: first
time since he left to enter the War Between
the States in 1864; S. H. Hearne, ’71, of
Albemarle, who has not missed a home=-
coming or commencement of Davidson since
1926; Dr. E. M. Summerell, ’76, of Mill
Bridge, and Dr. Geo. F. Robertson, ’78,
of Mount Holly.

North Carolina Jed in the state represen-
tation, naturally, but South Carolina, Georgia
and Virginia sent their largest delegations
to any Home-Coming of Davidson during
the past several years. Other states having
men on the campus last Saturday included
Texas, Illinois, New York, Maryland, Flor-
ida, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Alabama.

Alumni were here to listen to addresses
by three members of the Davidson faculty,
to enjoy an alumni*luncheon attended by ap-
proximately 300 people, to witness a scrappy
and exciting football game between V. P. I.
and Davidson, and to attend a stunt night
program. Included in the aluini visitors
were 20 members of Davidson’s 1910 state
championship team, and 14 of the 15 mem:
bers of the Alumni Council.

pionship team, had been chosen to do this.

expected, and this part of the program had

Correction

The. editor of this page corrects,
with pleasure, an error made in an
article published on this page Octo-
ber 9th, in which it was stated that
Dr. Neal L. Anderson, '85, had re-
signed as pastor of the Independent
Presbyterian Church at Savannah,
Ga. because of ill-health. The
source of information was a news-
paper, who had the matter con-
fused.

Dr. Anderson simply resigned on
the 13th anniversary of his minis-
try there in order to take up other
work on which he had long ago set
his heart.

Gridiron Heroes of Two Decades
Ago Were Center of Attention
Last Saturday—Twenty-Two
Were at Davidson

PERMANENT PLANS

Team Expects to Re-Unite in 1935
for Quarter-of-a-Century
Celebration

Davidson’s gridiron heroes of 1910 were
in the spotlight of attention at Davidson
Home-Coming Day, as they returned for
the first time for a reunion. Exactly two
decades ago they had won the championship
crown of North Carolina for the Presby-
terians, and after twenty years they came
back to their footbal training grounds, and
saw the lads of Davidson put up a great
fight against V. P. I., only to be defeated
by a monumental one-point margin.

Twenty players from all over America,
the coach and the manager of the famous
team were here Home-Coming Day. This
meant that all but two of the living mem-
bers of the squad in America were at David-
son. The only absentees were Dr. C. R.
Wilcox, ’11, Rome, Ga. and S. H. Kerr,
13, of Catonsville, Md. Rev. E. S. Currie,
12, of Haichow, China, was unable to be
here. The only deceased member of the team
is J. N. Van Devanter, ’15, who died last
year at Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Assembling -at specially arranged head-
quarters in the vacant house of Davidson’s
fraternity, the squad attended the morning
exercises in a body, went to the alumni
Juncheon together, and at the football game
sat grouped about the 1930 players’ benches.
Cheer leaders gave a yell for them, and the
stands joined by standing in honor of these
men during the cheer.

Following the football game, they reas-
sembled at headquarters, when they had as
special guests Mrs. Oren Moore, of Char-
lotte, formerly Miss Louise Murphy, their
sponsor, and Mrs. P. W. Booe, of David-
soh, at whose home they had their training
table while at Davidson. With appropriate
remarks, Coach Simmons presented them
with small tokens of appreciation. Later,
each man filled out a questionnaire, the sub-
stance of which will be later divulged in The
Davidsonian.

At night they had ari elaborate banquet
just to themselves. Coach Simmons was
toastmaster, and he allotted each man a few
minutes in which to tell of how fate had
treated him. A letter was read from Captain
Norton G. Pritchett, Davidson's professor
of physical education, informing the group
that Coach Simmons had been given honor-
ary membership in the “D” Club.

Fourteen of Fifteen
Council Members Here

Discussion of Plan for Enlargement
of Alumni Council Claims Atten-
tion—Committee Appointed

What is perhaps an attendance record for
the Alumni Council -was made here last
Saturday, when fourteen of the fifteen mem-
bers of this directing body gathered at Da-
vidson for a semi-annual meeting. Coming
from New York, Maryland, Virginia, South
Carolina and North Carolina, it was a trib-
ute to the alumni body that these men took
“time out” from their duties to meet in con-
ference to discuss affairs pertaining to the
Alumni Association.

Their attention was centered upon a dis-
cussion of a plan designed to increase the
size of the present Alumni Council, and a
proposed constitution and by-laws for the
alumni body. An exchange of ideas ensued,
with a result that a committee consisting
of H. Smith Richardson, ’06, of New York,
president, and Dr. Hamilton W. McKay,
’06,, and Dr. R. H. Lafferty, 99, both of
Charlotte, was appointed to re-draft the plan
at an early date. The principle of the pro-
posal was approved.

Attending the meeting were Mr. Richard-
son, Dr. McKay, Dr. Lafferty, Dr. G. M.
Maxwell, 96, Roanoke, Va.; W. S. Royster,
09, Norfolk, Va.; Henry T. Mills, ’06,
Greenville, S. C.; Dr. Oren Moore, ’08, and
L. H. Wilkinson, ’13, both of Charlotte;
J. Edward Johnston, ’14, Baltimore, Md.;
I. P. Graham, ’08, Cooleemee; Lunsford
Richardson, ’14, and John W. McAlister,
19, both of Greensboro; S. Clay Williams,
’05, Winston-Salem, and F. L. Jackson, ’06,
Davidson.

team, presented a gold football to their men-
tor. The group authorized Coach Simmons
to send a cablegram to Rev. Currie in China.
They also decided to meet five years from
now in a quarter-of-a-century reunion, and
perfected an organization with Dr. Kluttz
their captain, as head, and E. H. Graham, of
Goldsbora, better known as ‘Tiny” Graham,
as secretary.

On exhibition in the office of the alumni
secretary all during the day was the football
actually used in the defeat of the University
of North Carolina in 1910. The score was
6 to 0. The football had been stuffed and
shellacked, and on the outside was printed,
“1910. U. N. C., 0.; D. C, 6” This foot-
ball was on the banquet table for the feast-
ing eyes of the squad. During the day, the
men also wore badges that distinguished
them as members of the title team.
