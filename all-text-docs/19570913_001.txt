when the project is completed
it will cost. in excess. of $400,-
000. ;

The. plan is to build twelve

‘houses for the present group of

fraternities on campus: Each
house will cost about $30,000
when finished. However, the
decorating and furnishings will
be paid by the fraternities.
Mr. Martin said that the new
houses wils be ready for use
by next September. The new
court is located behind Belk
Dormitory on the hill that runs
from Main street to the gymna-
sium. A road has already been
cut that makes a half circle
from. the north side of Belk to

‘the road that runs between the

gym and Duke Dormitory.

Locations for the particular
houses will be decided at a
drawing which will be heid later
this year. Mr. Martin said that
names will be placed in a hat
and each fraternity will draw
for their particular places. This
arrangement was used when
the present court was first
opened.

There are. three designs of
the new houses. All are similar,
with variations in the design
of the porch.

Each house will havea large
living room, dining room, base
ment, and patio: In addition

42 Pre-Meds

Efforts were made to divide
the Orientation groups by indi-
cated vocation. Accordingly,
there are 42 Freshmen who are
listed as pre-meds. A dozen are
interested in either Medicine or.
Scientific work, and 28 are pro-
spective engineers.

Fourteen freshmen will enter
business, and fourteen have. in-
dicated their interest in the

ministry as their life’s work.
Twelve men are interested in
either Law or Teaching as a pro-
fession. Most of the Freshmen,
however, are undecided as to
their vocational choice.

College officials also noted an
increase in the number of boys
from the states of Texas and
New Jersey, and from the cities
of Greensboro, North Carolina,

‘and Jacksonville, Florida. Char.

lotte and Winston-Salem usually
win individual honors as the
two cities that’ sent the most
men to, Davidson, and have re-
peated this again this year.

Ten Bakers

Ten Freshmen hold Baker
Scholarships, and ten. were win-
ners of National Merit Scholar-
ships. The latter is a compara-
tlvely new scholarship, having
been instituted only two years
ago. Over 800 of these scholar-
ships are given nationally each
year, and Davidson is a leader
in the number of men who have
won this honor.

Other scholarships held by
incoming Freshmen include two
Union Carbide winners, eight
Honor Scholarships, one Proc-
tor-Gamble winner; one Curtis
B. Johnson holder, and one C.
R. Harding scholarship winner.

Members of the Class of ‘61
were introduced to the College
in a well-planned Orientation
program which also included
more informal activities such
as the Union open houses. In-
coming Freshmen also took the
usual battery of tests, a math
test, an English test, a psy-
chological test. and a physical
test.

The expected enrollment for
the entire College this year is
anticipated to be about 860 stu-
dents.
