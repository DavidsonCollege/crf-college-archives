Two movies you shouldn’t let youself miss Davidson artists perform in Charlotte
at the Living Arts Cafe and Gallery

By Setu Davis

I'd like to take this space to review two films
which I think are worth seeing. The first film, The
Messenger, is out in theatres right now, showing
for example, at the Movies at the Lake just down
the road. The second is Midnight in the Garden of
Good and Evil, and you can find it in your local
Blockbuster. So, whether or not you prefer to rent
movies or see them in the theatre, there will be
something for you in this review.

Luc Besson, writer and director of the ac-
claimed The Fifth Element, takes on quite a differ-
ent story in his new film The Messenger. In this
new film Besson presents the story of Saint Joan of
Arc, the famed French hero who was burned at the
stake for her claim of having received divine
visions. Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element, Re-
turn to the Blue Lagoon, and He Got Game) stars
as Joan. Once again working with Besson, Jovovich
displays the same abilities which served her well
in the Fifth Element. Her Joan is an enigmatic

figure whose visions are called into question by
the film.

The battle scenes in The Messenger are ex-
tremely gruesome; I dare say, they are more vio-
lent than Braveheart. Bloodied weapons and

clothes abound, alongside decapitations and dis-
memberments. While the film isn’t as moving as
it seemingly wants to be, it is -very interesting
towards the end. I won’t spoil anything, but
Dustin Hoffman makes a surprise appearance as
the most intriguing character in the whole film.

Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil
stars Kevin Spacey as Jim Williams, a rich
Savannahian, and John Cusack as a reporter from
New York. Midnight tells the story of William’s
killing of a young man. The movie delves into
everything from Georgia voodoism to the high
society of Savannah. Williams, arich Savannahian
whose parties are the center of high society, kills
his young lover out of what appears to be self-
defense. Cusack’s character is in town to review
one of William’s parties for Town and Country
magazine. During the course of the story these two
men become friends.

As the story progresses Williams becomes
more and more morally ambiguous. This ambigu-
ity isn’t ever resolved. The supporting cast in-
cludes director Clint Eastwood’s daughter Alison,
Jude Law, Jack Thompson, Irma P. Hall, and the
Lady Chablis. The Lady Chablis threatens to steal
the show at times, as she plays herself in the movie.

So as the year winds down, take some time to
run to the theatre or the video store and enjoy one
of these films.

BUT YOU STILL
HAVE A VOICE.

The creative spirit of Davidson found its way
into Charlotte this past week, as The Living Arts
Gallery and Café displayed the artwork of sopho-
more Bécca Wilson and the performances of,
among others, the Davidson Dance Troupe. Over
two nights, Thurday,

November 18 and

come perform. Julia, who heads up the Dance
Troupe, was instrumental in organizing the artists
who performed.

Becca’s art show was entitled “The Creation
of Nature in Color & Motion.” Most of the pieces
in the show were created during this past summer.
While Becca’s art adorned the walls, the Dance
Troupe performed every half-hour. “In between
their performances other students read, played, or

sang.

Friday, November
19, Davidson stu-
dents displayed their
talents in art, dance,
poetry, and music be-
fore large crowds of
both Davidson stu-
dents and gallery pa-
trons.

Both Thursday
and Friday night be-
came standing room
only as people piled
in to see the perfor-
mances and look
upon the artwork.

Neither night would have been possible with-
out the efforts of Becca Wilson and Julia Philpott.
Becca’s work was displayed in the gallery, and it
was her idea to invite other Davidson artists to

Davidson College
needs more nights
like these in celebra-
tion and presentation
of students’ artistic
abilities.

Is it too much to
hope that Davidson
College can play host
to such an event ona
somewhat regular ba-
sis? “I celebrate my-
self, and sing my-
self,” says Walt
Whitman in his fa-
mous opening to Song of Myself.

In the future, I hope, Davidson artists and can
do the same here at Davidson.
