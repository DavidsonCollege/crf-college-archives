Environmental Conference

An environmental conference will be held at Davidson March 3-7.
This week long gathering of politicians, environmentalists, researchers
and students will raise questions about the state of the environment, its
importance to us, and how everyone can help preserve it. As part of this
event, sponsored by The Dean Rusk Program through a grant provided
by NCNB Corporation, there will be an art show in the Student Union.
Both visual and written art works are welcome from student and faculty.
Paintings, drawings, photographs, poems, short stories - anything!

The main topics of the conference are Population, Resource Bases,
Native Americans, Rainforest and the Coastal Environment. These are

Recyle Davidsonians

suggested topics to focus on, but not guidelines for the artwork.
If you have a proposal or any questions, please contact Ruth Pittard -
