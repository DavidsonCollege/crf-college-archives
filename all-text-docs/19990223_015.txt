This past weekend, the men’s track
team once again defied history and ex-
ceeded expectations. This season has
been shaping up as the best track and
field season in many years at Davidson,
and this weekend showed that a new era
has arrived.

Fueled by the loud cheers, physi-
cal races, and tight turns at VMI’s
Cormack Field House, the men’s track
team posted 18 points (7th place) at the
1999 Southern Conference Indoor
Championships, held February 19-20.

It was the highest recorded point
total in many seasons, and the most
since head coach Gary Andrew’s ar-
rival in 1986. (The 1971 squad has the
highest point total ever for Davidson,

finishing in 4th place with 20 points).
Western Carolina won their first indoor
crown since joining the SoCon, scoring
159.5 points, outdistancing runner-up
Appalachian State (139.5 points). Host
VMI claimed the third-place spot with
108 points.

Friday’s events saw Michael
Albert run a Wildcat Top Ten Perfor-
mance in the 55m, finishing in :06.81
seconds. Addam Marcotte also com-
peted, running a :06.90. Albert contin-
ued to lead the sprint group during the
weekend, as he posted a time of :54.01
in the 400m. Freshman Grant Bleecher
sped to a :55.52, with John Moore just
behind him in :56.45. Co-Captain Stan
Baker completed the 400m crew, plac-
ing in :57.02. Marcotte also competed
in the 200m (:24.72), in addition to
Baker’s performance (:25.39).

| highest score Davidson has had since
p. 1992.

days, the running events began on Fri-
[day with the 3000 meters. Seniors

Jenny Klotz (11:48), Beth Brewster,

i (12:33), Katie Lannon (12:36), and
) freshman Hannah Grimes (11:48) rep-
» resented Davidson with four solid races.

a ‘Following this quartet was senior

amilah Sawyer racing the 55-meter
~ hurdle prelims. Sawyer advanced to the
© finals where she earned Davidson three
© points with her sensational sixth place
3 finish, Also advancing to the finals in
the 800 meters was sophomore Smyth
) Bitter who placed 9" overall. Freshmen
Julia Kudravetz (2:36) and Rhiannon
Ollis (2:38) and seniors Janet Aardema
(2:41) and Tab Combs (2:59) all ran a
strong 800 meters as well.

The last event of Friday was the DMR
(Distance Medley Relay), which con-
sists of a 1200, 400, 800, and 1600
meters, was run by Lucy Billingsley,

Jamilah Sawyer, Clare Frey, and Smyth
Bitter, respectively. With a phenom-
enal third place finish, the foursome not
only had an All-Southern Conference
performance but they shattered the
school record with a 12:45.16. This
third place finish brought in Davidson’s
first six points of the weekend.

Saturday’s racing was launched into
action with the 1600 meter raced by
Bitter (5:23), Billingsley (5:26), Frey

(5:28), and senior Ellen Runnels (6:20). '

Bitter, Billingsley and Frey placed 10",
12, and 13" overall, respectively.
Klotz, Brewster, and Lannon braved
out yet another lengthy race in the 5000
meters—25 laps around the indoor track.
With a time of 20:32, Klotz raced her
personal best for an indoor 5K.

Wrapping up the weekend’s competi-
tion were studs Billingsley, Frey, Ollis,
and Sawyer in the 4x400 meter relay.
The relay team earned two points with
a strong 7" place finish.

Coach Cason comments, “This was the
strongest team showing since 1992. It
was a great meet for our team. I can’t
wait until the outdoor season when our
team will continue to improve.”

The forte of Caroline Little and Wendy
Legerton, both talented freshmen, was
sorely missed this weekend. Throwers
Yolanda Kirby and Kristy Noesges and
sprinter Machelle Borders will also bring
strength and depth to the team as they
join the group for outdoor track.

For me, Roger Clemens’ story is
a story of childhood. It is a story of a
boy who needed a hero and found one
in a Red Sox uniform. It is not a new
story, but one worth repeating in an
era far removed from the days when
baseball was simply a game. I admit

from these days. ‘Maybe my image of
the early years of baseball is clouded
by Field of Dreams and Ken Burns’
documentaries.

Even $c boy com deat I'm
not sure why we need heroes, but I do
know that a six year old kid in Tampa,
Florida was caught up in the midst of

outlet. Months in a body cast can
really irritate a kid. You body itches
all the time and there isn’t a thing that
you can do about it. When you’re not
thinking about the itching in your calf
you sit around and watch television.
Cartoons, in the end, just can’t cut it.

thing to do. My dad had always been
