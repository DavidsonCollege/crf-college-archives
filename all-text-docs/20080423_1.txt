Since its inception, The
Davidson Show has proven to be a
major hit amongst students on
campus, humorously highlighting
many of the subtleties of Davidson
life that often go unnoticed. Every
couple of weeks anew episode pre-
mieres in the 900 Room and a
small television in the Union runs
the show continuously. I recently
sat down with Austin Bell ’10, the
producer of The Davidson Show to
ask him about the influence the
show has on the school.

Clint Smith: So, where did the
idea for The Davidson Show come
from?

Austin Bell: To be entirely hon-
est, it came to me in a dream; I
woke up shouting about The
Davidson Show at the top of my
lungs. It scared the [Hades] out of
the rest of the Economics 101
class. After that, I went out and
bought PVC pipe and green fabric
from Lowe’s and Wal-Mart, and
the next day, 1 had constructed the
coolest green PVC sailboat you
had ever seen. Two weeks after

Survey exposes varying opin-

ions on library

By ALissA CURRAN
Staff Writer

Davidson College’s notorious
workload drives students to work
arduously during all hours of the
day. This trend has transformed tra-
ditionally academic sanctuaries on
campus into places where social
and scholarly ambitions converge.
For this reason, the Library Space
Planning Committee faces a new
struggle in deciding whether poten-
tial renovations in the library
should preserve its conventional
role or cater to those who see it as
a social hotspot.

The Library Space Planning
Committee is researching future
renovation options for the library.
They ‘conducted a survey of stu-
dents, staff and faculty for one
week during March to understand
better the different roles of the
library for participants.

Twenty-four percent of students
and 40 percent of staff participated
in the survey, which pleased Dr.
Pat Sellers, Professor of Political
Science and creator of the survey.

“I think it provides a good cross-
section of opinions,” Sellers said.

The survey covered a wide range
of questions, which aimed at quan-
tifying trends across “high-use”
and “low-use” students, faculty
and staff.

The survey classified “low-use”
persons as those who use the
library less than eight hours per

renovation

week, while “high-use” students
exceed that length of time. The
study found that amongst students,
the average number of hours per
week spent in the library was 11.97
hours, roughly a third of the total
average time students spend study-
ing.

The survey revealed a wide
range in the role of the library for
different people at Davidson,
which will make reaching a con-
sensus challenging.

In a question that asked why stu-
dents do not use the library, 36 per-
cent of participants cited the reason
as “too many people,” while 34
percent attributed it to being “too’
quiet.”

“This really just shows that peo-
ple use the library in very different
ways,” Sellers said. “The question
is: how can we address these dif-
ferent needs?”

Though other areas of the survey
expose stark differences in the
function of the library for students
and faculty, the two groups agreed
on what constitutes the “ideal work
space:” Both listed computers,
space to spread out, quiet, comfort-
able furniture, lighting and an
informal and cozy environment as
the most important characteristics
of the optimal workspace. High-
and low-use members of both
groups also agreed on the impor-
tance of these working conditions.

Students and faculty also shared

that, I had shot and edited a pilot
for the show.

CS: I can only imagine the
class’s reaction. Is this how you
usually come up with your ideas
for the show?

AB: My ideas for the show now
usually come from situations I
observe around campus as a
Davidson student. For example,
when I went to “Waiting For Lefty”
and got panhandled as I entered, I
imagined what it would be like if
students did that in normal
Davidson situations that required
change, such as paying library fees.

When all else fails, I'll just lock
myself in a room and read Voltaire
until I'm pretty sure I've gone
crazy, and I write down the first
thing that pops into my head and
call it a script.

CS: Well, Pm sure that you’re
not the first person to do
that...actually you might be. Do
you receive funding from school or
does this come out of your own
pocket?

AB: The Union Board, specifi-
cally William Brown, pays for our
Chick-Fil-A at premieres, and due

to a fairly minor contract stipula-
tion, I am required to say that he is
the handsomest man I have ever
had the pleasure to meet at least
once per interview. Otherwise,
everything up to this point has been
done entirely without school sup-
port. Other than occasionally using
editing computers in the media lab,
we've been using personal equip-
ment and tapes.

CS: I’m sure that William will be
flattered to know that you think
he’s so handsome. So, who helps
you write the show?

AB: We have a very dedicated
and entertaining team of writers
that, come together and toss around
ideas and their execution before
each show. Ultimately, we do as
many of the more popular ideas as
we can. When that doesn’t work, I
try bribing them with candy, and if
they get too rowdy, I spike their
Kool-Aid.

CS: Sounds like a pretty unique
group of individuals. Are they vol-
unteers or did you pick them your-
self?

AB: All are volunteers, but some
