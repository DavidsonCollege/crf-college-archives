Calling Off Dances
Was Right Decision

The administration’s decision to call-off the Home-
coming festivities was the only logical alternative.

With Asian flu cases mounting by the hour, it would
be risky indeed to predict the state of affairs come Fri-
day and Saturday, Even tonight the number of cases has
reached the point where class instruction is almost in-
effective. Who knows what the situation will be tomor-
row.

By calling off the dances, the administration has
lessened the possibility of numerous complications. It
means thet many students will not experience the un-
happy plight of having their date call at the last moment.
to say that she too has the flu. It means that the residents
of Belk dormitory will not have to move into close-
quarters. Already many flu victims are recuperating in’
their dormitory rooms.

(

The manner in which the administration came to
its decision is highly commendable. Dr. Pietenpol. Dean
Bailey, Mr. Martin. and other officials met with the Stu-
dent Council yesterday afternoon to get student opinion.
Then last night. Dr. Pietenpol met with the IFC to see
how they stood on the matter. This morning a joint meet-
ing gave its backing to the administration’s decision.

In-the erid. of course, the decision was up to the,
college officials. But the fact that. student feeling was
asked for is another example of the pleasant relationship
that exists between the faculty and students.

And not to be overlooked is the most generous offer
from the Treasurer that the college will try to help meet
half for the financial obligations of the IFC in its con-
tract with the dance band.

Weighing all factors, the college had little choice
but to call off the dances.
