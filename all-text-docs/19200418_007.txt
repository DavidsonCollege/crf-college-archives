Greensboro, and although he had
‘the constant attention of specialists
ifor over eight years he never re-

covered. The funeral services were |

held at Society Hill, Thursday, the
twenty-fifth. By his special request
| his body was interred beside that
of his son.

|. He was born in York County, S.
C., and graduated from Davidson in
| 1879, after which he went to Colum-
bia Theological Seminary. All his
‘ministerial life was spent in South
Carolina, except for a pastorate of
two and a half years at Greensboro.
For some time he served as an
j evangelist in Pee Dee Presbytery.
His last charge was at Greensboro,
iafter which failing health forced
him to cease from active duty.

Mr. Wilson is survived by his
'wife, who was Miss Margaret Car-
rigan, and a son, Carrigan Wilson.
| The profusion of flowers that cover-
ed the grave and the many friends
who came from a distance to attend
the service bore cloquent  tes-
timony to his popularity as a min-
ister and a man.

Rev. George L. Petrie, D.D., '59,
pastor of the Charlottesville, church
and of many University students,
has completed 42 years of service.
On his 80th birthday, Feb. 25, the
congregation celebrated the oc-
casion with exercises simple and _in-
formal, and the finest taste. The
outstandng feature of the service
was an address by Dr. Petrie, re-
viewing not only the eight decades
of his life, but his sixty years in the

service in that field. He was re-
ferred to as “the alert, upstanding,

|| debonair and consecrated man of
God.”
