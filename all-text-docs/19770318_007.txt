The Davidsonian

Evaluation of alternative policies due

By CATHERINE LANDIS
DAVID TINKLER
and
THOM YOUNG

Davidson’s educational policy is
not merely following the national trend
toward conservatism. It never moved
that far to the left in the first place.
Instead, we’re drifting because the
move is passive. Because we need
innovative leadership in the role of
academic vice president, his role will
be crucial in determining an

educational policy.

For example, what does it mean
when you obtain a major from
Davidson College? It should mean you
are proficient in the area of your major.

But the requiremens for a major do
not necessarily yield proficiency. Most
departments concentrate upon lecture
courses in which students can go to
class, take notes, pass tests, without
truly exploring the subject. In fact, the
philosophy and religion departments
are the only two departments which
require seminars for the major.

We propose Davidson require in-
dependent thought, not just suggest it.

It is easy to point out how seminars
and independent study programs are
available if desired, then ask why make
them mandatory when all students do
not work well self-motivated. This
attitude, however, pampers students

and allows them to escape a true
commitment to their major.

Even worse, it fosters an at-
mosphere of academic inflexibility and
discourages independent thought

because of lack of time, initiative, or

encouragement.

The Extended Studies program has
proven to give some students their most
rewarding educational experience. Yet
its continuance is shaky.

Innovative educational policy
would not allow the program to be
abolished. It would seek to upgrade it.
We propose the maintenance of a high
quality independent study program.

Upgrading it would necessarily
help the quality of the 301-401 program.
English might be the best example. The
Comprehensive Exam is a joke to
majors. Instead, 301 could provide a
student the opportunity for exciting and
educational research.

The attitude does not restrict itself
to majors; it permeates throughout the
entire Davidson academic atmosphere.
Students enter Davidson and are im-
mediately encouraged by their faculty
advisors and hall counselors to get their
area requirements out of the way.

This speed does not lead to the well-
rounded student ready after adequate

exposure to decide in which field of

study he would like to concentrate.

It yields a bored, frustrated, and
confused student who has managed to
take dilettantish courses such as
Chemistry 21 or other courses which
pass his area requirement without
giving him any real knowledge.

The solution cannot be an abolish-
ment of area requirements unless we
want to threaten the liberal arts ideal.
What we should do is try to make them
match that ideal.

We propose introductory courses be
reevaluated and make them in-
formative rather than boring. The
professor’s attitude toward them would
help here. It is common knowledge no
professor likes to teach introductory
classes; the attitude does nothing to
stimulate a student.

Introductory courses should be the
most important. Now they are
threatened like bad medicine or a joke.

The other solution would be to

impress upon the student area
requirements can be extended over

four years. Students can begin im-

z

mediately taking courses they like
instead of only those they need. This
speed might alleviate a majority of
students who rightly feel their
Davidson education to be futile.

What we are taking about isa whole .
academic atmosphere. This week’s
focus is an attempt to question that
atmosphere. It is not a tangible thing.
But its influence infects students,
faculty, and administration with
stagnation.

Policies as they stand are not
questioned. Alternatives are not even
considered. Class structure is stifling,
and independent study is stifled. The
EPC hides under a code of secrecy
which leads to distrust among both
faculty and students. The pressure of
grades actively hinders ex-
perimentation.

Of course there are exceptions. We
are not warned about the exceptions.
They would get a meaningful education
wherever they were.

We are talking about the majority
of Davidson students who go through
this place. We're talking about the
educational policy for those students.
The new Academic Vice-President has
the potential power to make that policy.

We feel it is every Davidson

‘students’ responsibility to make sure

the new vice-president knows what
students want from that policy. We
propose they tell him.

No, an institution cannot make a
student think, but it can encourage it.
We do not think Davidson even tries.

Faculty support spurs center into firm program

By CATHERINE LANDIS
Editor

“Basically we’re here to
offer an alternative track for
students who have. particular
academic interests they can’t
satisfy in the regular
curriculum.” So explains Dr.
Charles-Avinger, chairman of
the Center for Special Studies.

Avinger hopes to clear up
what he fears to be widespread
misconceptions about the
Center. “I have heard things
like students do not think they
can get in without a 3.8 average.
That’s just not true.

“All it takes. to get in is
interest, imagination, and a
commitment to a goal.’ He
adds there is no minimum
grade point average. Students
enter at the beginning of a term
after talking to Avinger, then
arrange their academic
program.

The only students the
Center does not encourage are
what Avinger describes as ‘‘one
shot, one term’’ programs. He
feels a longer time is necessary.
He also discourages freshmen
as freshmen, believing it is
important for freshmen to get
the basic courses out of the way.

Avinger describes . the
program: ‘“‘There are twa
major areas where the Honors
Center can assist the student.
The, first is for the self-

ot a college for motivated student who wants to

aid Burts. ‘if we design a particular program.

e for everybody “For example Cindy

re sponsored by Newberry is working in

le requirement linguistics, Roger Brown in

n effect. solar energy, Caroline

fi epee is & Cromartie in architecture, and

zation. Stahmann in nutrition
decided this is and physiology.”

+ pitch. The second approach to the
aware of any Center is to enter one of the
“with this or any three interdisciplinary

iat anything else programs in Public Policy

said. Studies, American Studies, or

Dramatic

Literature and
Theater.
Avinger outlines’ the

programs. He says the Public
Policy Studies Program  an-
swers the ‘‘growing concern for
the ‘public interest’, for
governmental guidance on
social issues, and for efficiency
and responsiveness in govern-
ment activity which demand
that greater attention be given
to public policy analysis.”

The 1977-78 American
Studies Program will focus on a
single theme: the _ in-
terrelationships of rural, small
town, and city life in America
from the colonial period to the
present.

Avinger says ‘‘through
seminars and independent
research, students in the
American Studies Program will
examine the images, symbols,
and myths that Americans have
adopted towards these various
modes of living.’’

The Dramatic Literature
and Theater Program differs
from the others in that it is
designed for juniors and seniors
who preferably have completed
all requirements necessary for
acceptance into the junior class.

Once a student enters the
Center he follows his own
programs. The Center can
waive all area requirements.
Avinger points out, however,
“the Center has a commitment
to the liberal arts and we en-
courage our students to satisfy
the requirements.

The Center also offers what
Avinger describes as not hard
and fast guidelines.
Sophomores are encouraged to
take four out of nine courses
related to the program and
juniors and seniors, five.The

_courses can be seminars,

student is required to take at
least one of the in-
terdisciplinary seminars the
Center offers.

“The major reason for this
later requirement,’”’ Avinger
explains, “‘is to try and develop
a sense of intellectual com-
munity.”

To this same end the Center
also holds a ‘fix your own
sandwich, put a buck in the jar’
lunch every Monday where
faculty, students and guests
give presentations.

As of the December 14
faculty vote of confidence the
Center for Special Studies will
continue stable and
The Center was under EPC
evaluation as a result of the
resolution to do so in a study
done four years ago.

The result of the study

tutorials, regular courses, or
independent study. Then every

~ ended in a vote by the faculty
which expressed confidence in

the role of the Center. The
faculty also agreed to change

the name‘ from ‘Center for
Honors Studies” to ‘‘Center for
Special Studies.”

The faculty turned down the
EPC proposals to require
Center students to satisfy area,
P.E. and composition
requirements and to limit the
number of faculty appointments
to the Center.

The vote of confidence
reflects the enthusiasm of
faculty members involved in
the program. While staffing is a
problem because of depart-
mental pressure not to lose the
availability of staff, Avinger
says those that do accept are
“excited.” He described the
experience as ‘rearranging the
expertise at Davidson to satisfy
the self-developed, special
interest academic programs.”

“He smiled, “I'm not just —
teaching economics.’’
