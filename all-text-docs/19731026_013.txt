President nd t President
Nixon would never give up the
Watergate tapes, it was also a
virtual certainty that the Wild
cat football team would collap-
se in front of powerful William
and Mary

David Harper thought other-
wise. In an effort not before wit-
nessed this season by Davidson
football fans, the offensive
machine of the Wildcats started
toroll

Before the game was over
the Wildcats had amassed some
532 total yards which brought
back memories of the 777 yards
piled up against Erskine
College back in 1946.

Harper completed 37 of 59
passes for 374 yards and had the
William and Mary secondary
fighting for their lives most of
the game.

Gary Pomeroy, with 13 cat-
ches, led the Wildcat receivers,
with Walt Walker and Mike
Harding raking in 11 and eight
respectively.

Harper's arm permitted the
Wildcats to control the game far
better than at any time earlier
this season. The Cats ran 95
plays from scrimmage. The
1973 Wildcat average is slight-
ly above 71.

Although the Davidson team
lost the game, the credit due
Harper and the entire team for
the courage they displayed
against enormous odds is
tremendous.

Harriers Snap Jinx With Richmond Win

Overcoming the one point
defeat plague, the Davidson
cross-country team defeated a
powerful Richmond team, then
followed with a third place
finish in Monday’s Davidson In-
vitational. The harriers met
Richmond last Friday on
Davidson’s home course for a
six mile race.

Richmond had a very suc-
cessful recruiting year, and
three of their top freshmen run-
ners ‘were from the same high
school. But, with all the
Statistics aside, the Wildcats
went out and ran the best team
race of he season, coming out on

top, 27-29.

Sailors Wrecked At OD

By TRACY CHARLES
Staff Writer

The regatta scheduled to be
held at Old Dominion Univer-
sity last weekend was cancelled
after six schools tried sailing
the ODU boats for several
hours, but were unable to hold
them together.

New masts on all of the boats
coupled with inexperienced
workmanship on the part of
ODU caused shrouds and masts
to disconnect and fall about the
heads of the visiting skippers.

This coming weekend looks to
be more favorable for the team.
The Fall Eliminations will be
held at Davidson this weekend.

On Saturday, five teams will
vie for one of the first three
places. These three teams will
go on to the Championships on
Nov. 10.

The location of the Cham-
pionships will be determined by
the three top teams.

In an effort to get students to
attend the eliminations. the
sailing team has ordered a keg
of beer to whet the thirst of
those who want to picnic, study
and watch the races off the
point Saturday afternoon.

In addition to the beer. there
will be information on the
nature of the race course. This
will include its position and how
it is to be sailed.

These efforts are being made
for the benefits of those who

know little or nothing about’

sailing

Those who know little or
nothing about sailing are in-
vited to come, relax, learn
something about racing and in-
dulge in beer and good weather.

The races start at 10 a.m.

The most outstanding per-
formance came from Rick Bell.

Martin was also very im-
pressed with the performances
of Jeff Neikirk and Jesse Smith
who finished fourth and fifth,
respectively behind Bell and
two Richmond runners.

“Rick had his best race of the
year,” Martin commented. ‘‘He
led the entire race.”

Bell covered the six mile
course in an impressive time of
33:04.

Besides Neikirk and Smith,
Martin also cited the per-
formances of sophomore Bill
Cole and junior Rick ‘‘The
Lube”’ Deal.

‘They did a real fine job of
breaking up the Richmond
team,” he praised.

After the much deserved win
against Richmond, the Wildcats
hosted three other teams in the
Davidson Invitational. The
three teams participating were
Wake Forest. High Point and
Appalachian.

The distance was set once
again at six miles. When it was
over, Davison finished a ‘‘disap-
pointing” third, with first place
going to a much impreved
Deacon team, while Ap-
palachian copped second.

‘‘As a team, we had one of our
worst races of the season,”’ ac-
cording to Martin. ‘‘I think the
boys were suffering from
Friday’s meet and they had a
tough time running the meets so
close together.”’

Wake Forest ran a very im-
pressive race, with number one
man Tommy Rae finishing the
six miles in 31:42.

Number one finisher for
Davidson was Bell.

Presently sporting a 4-5 won-
loss record, the Wildcat
Harriers travel to Raleigh this
weekend for the North Carolina

State Championships.

After Saturday's meet, the
cross country team travels to
High Point for a Tri-meet with
High Point and Elon.

“The tri-meet should boost
our record to over 500,’’ Martin

in an optimistic tone.
