in front of very good fans and against an outstanding coach and basketball team.”

The ‘96-97 Blue Devils are loaded.”

play your game, and try to block them out.”

Notes: Blue Devils (5-2) fell to Indiana in Chase Preseason NIT Final Nov. 29 at Madison Square Garden...have looked
strong and athletic in the early going, playing stifling defense...will be even better next year, having recently secured the

TSN on the Minutemen: Offseason departures have left a once-deep team struggling to find
players to fill out practice. A fifth consecutive Sweet 16 will be harder to achieve thanitonce seemed.”

Notes: Minutemen were No. | in last season’s final AP poll and became just the ninth squad in NCAA history to post 35+
wins...lost in Final Four to eventual titleist Kentucky...led by first-year coach Bruiser Flint, who took over this summer
for John Calipari, now coach of the NBA Nets...currently 3-3, having suffered losses to Cal and Virginia at the season-

The Brown twins entered Davidson
last fall as the most highly touted pair of
recruits in the history of the women’s bas-
ketball program.

Andafter largely injury-plagued rookie
campaigns dotted by indications of their
sky-high potential and more injuries this preseason, Kerry and Jamie
are finally relatively healthy and dazzling the Belk Arena crowd with
pinpoint passing and an uncanny sixth sense on the court.

Both scored in double figures on Saturday against Columbia and

Kerry tallied 13
points, 5 rebounds,
and 3 assists, while
Jamie recorded 8
points, 10 boards,
and 5 assists.

the-back passing play on a fast break in the final minute of the first
half.

“They’ ll do things like that in practice,” said coach John Filar.
“Tt’s one of those twin things.”

How deep is this team? In the Mercer game at the Colorado St.
tournament, 11 Wildcats played double-digit minutes and no one
played more than 25.

Filar routinely gives eight to nine players more than 10 minutes.

Filar was appreciative of the enthusiastic crowd at the tournament
this weekend.

“T thank the student body for coming out,” he said. “We really
need them to be at as many games as possible.”

Still, only 219 fans showed up for Sunday’s championship game.
(Editor’s note: That number needs to be higher. Much higher.)

The coaching staff believes the Cheesbrough-Ponds Invitational
can become an annual rite here at Davidson.

“We hope that they (Cheesbrough-Ponds) will be kind enough to
continue their support,” said Filar after Sunday’s title win over UNC-
Wilmington.

Filar also commented that fourth-year assistant coach Jennifer
Roos deserves much of ihe credit for coordinating this weekend’s
events. :

better.”
