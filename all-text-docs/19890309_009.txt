The athletic Master Plan

By BRUCE NEWSOME

Other teams would love tocome
to Davidson and play since they
would be guaranteed that there
would not be a rainout. The Cats
would thus be guaranteed a large
number of home games where the
home crowd could make the dif-
ference. Only with this addition
can the baseball team be able to get
in the necessary number of games
necessary to qualify forthe NCAA
regional playoffs.

Secondly, the Knobloch
Tennis Center needs to be ex-
panded greatly. With the addition
of 12 more indoor courts, the
men’s and women’s teams could
play matches at the same time on
the same day. This addition would
also provide adequate practice
space. The enhanced practice
space would allow the women’s
team to prepare to the utmost of
their ability for their Spring Break
trip to Hawaii.

Also, the tennis team needs pro-
fessional umpires for each of their
matches. Against Old Dominion,
the Cats lost 5-4. In Blake
O’Brien’s match, he hit a winning
shot that would have given him the
match. However, the ODU player
called it out when the ball was

clearly in bounds. This blatant lie

cost Davidson the match.
A third building that is needed is
an indoor driving range for the golf

‘ team. The team presently must

drive to the Charlotte Country
Club to practice, but the bad
weather has cut down on the prac-
tice time. With an indoor driving
range, the team could practice in
bad weather and reduce their trav-
eling time to and from Charlotte.
The golf team could-also use a
full-time coach. Coach Slagle is
doing a good job, but his first pri-
ority should be the soccer team.
The -track also needs resur-
facing. After the resurfacing is

completed, an inflatable air bubble
could be placed over the track so
that the runners could train when-
ever they want. We cannot have
the track team catching cold and

’ being unable to preform up to their

potential.

Once all these additions are
made, Davidson should have the
facilities that it needs for a top
flight athletic program in the
middle of the North Carolina rain
forest.

Men’s tennis bounds into stiff competition this week

The men’s tennis team is in the middle of
its busiest week. The Wildcats will play
nine matches in as many days. The team (4-
5) faces some of its stiffest competition
during this stretch.

The Wildcats have already played several
ACC opponents. They lost the season
opener to North Carolina 8-1. They were
shut out against seventh ranked South Caro-
lina, but Coach Jeff Frank has not been
disappointed in the performance.

“Our losses have been to ACC opponents
and other very strong teams,” said Frank.
“We're playing a lot of our stronger oppo-
nents here at the beginning of the season.
We’ ve only lost to one team (Richmond)
this year that we beat last year.”

In addition to the tough schedule early in
the season, Frank also cited inexperience

and lack of court time as factors in the
team’s performance. “We have a lot of
players in our lineup that have not had expe-

rience where they are playing this year,”
said Frank. ‘“(Senior) Sebastian Koch,
(junior) Tim Hagood, and (sophomore)

striking out five Bulldogs while allowing
only four hits. Mikio Aoki and Steve

Mark Weir had a base hit-

Liebdzinski, in his first collegiate at-bat,
reached first when Embry couldn’t field his
bouncer back to the mound. After a fly out
that would have ended the inning, Davidson
put together three hits and a walk to score.
Holland’s double to center field drove in
Weir and Liebdzinski. After a walk to Iser-

‘nia, Aoki followed with another double to

score two more runs. Livesey drove in Aoki
with a single to right, and then was caught
stealing to end the inning.

Davidson scored their final run in the
fourth as Iserniaand Aoki walked to start the
inning, Livesey came through again with a
single to left as Isernia scored his second run
of the game.

Jeff Loser, Derek Twombly and Jim
Stanfill pitched the final four innings, hold-
ing Wingate to only one hit.

The Wildcats were to face Radford Uni-
versity on Friday, but the rains returned,

postponing the Cats’ next five games. The
Cats are scheduled to open a five game
homestand on Wednesday (March 8, 2pm)
against NC State, with Wofford on Friday
(2pm) and Lafayette on Saturday (12pm) for
a doubleheader and a single game on Sun-
day (12pm). All games will be played at
Wildcat Park on campus. Hopefully the sun
will shine for a change and fans will come
out to enjoy the good weather cheering for
the Cats.

Notes: The Wildcats started two freshmen
(Azzolino, Liebdzinski). Both got their first
collegiate hit...Freshman Tim Kerns singled
in his first collegiate at-bat...Ron Kmacik
crashed into the left-center field fence trying
to make a spectacular running catch. He was
shook-up on the play, but remained in the
game for two innings until being replaced by

_Danny Cotton in the fifth. Kmacik is not

expected to miss any games.

Club lacrosse loses opener

—~ @

By BEN TREGOE
A solid thumping is always good to get

your perspective back. Pfeiffer delivered .

the goods, fourteen of them, and we were
much obliged to accept them.

Although Pfeiffer is a Division III team,
the problem was not talent. The Davidson

team has plenty of skill and speed. The

problem was in organization. We were a
monastery of Vietnamese Buddhist monks
pouring gas on ourselves in the middle of
Richardson field and throwing maiches on
each other.

Davidson accumulated about fifteen pen-
alty minutes which did more to hurt the team
than anything else. For each penalty a

player has to come off the field for thirty or —
sixty seconds. Lacrosse is a high scoring ~

~ game, so giving a well disciplined team a
man advantage is like giving them a goal.

Budweiser Players of the Game go to the
managers, Kim White, Marlo. Cobb, and
Courtney Nichols. From keeping track of
the penalties to arguing with the referee,
they were the only ones to keep their cool.
Michael Malory and Boyd Miller had the
best games of the rest of the team.

The offense tallied only three goals, with
Robbie Huber scoring one, and Dave
Becker netting two. Ken Nazemetz receives
the Hit of the Game award in his lacrosse
premier.

At the final whistle is was Pfeiffer 14-
Davidson 3, This Saturday at 2 p.m. come
out and see the much improved Davidson
team take on Elon.
