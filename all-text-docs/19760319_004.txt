Clewell predicts energy shortages

By LYMAN COLLINS
Assistant News Editor
This year’s Woodrow Wilson Fel-
low and Senior Vice-President of
Mobil Oil Company, Dr. D. H.
Clewell, spoke at Davidson March
15-19. Clewell discussed several
topics during his five-day visit,
including the world role of multina-
tional corporations, free speech and
the college press.
His main topic, however, was the
‘Oil industry and its place in the world
today.

‘Oil production in the United
States peaked out in 1970,”’ said
Clewell. ‘‘Since then we’ve been
importing 40-per cent of our oil. If we
don’t start increasing our own sup-
plies, in 10 years we'll be buying 75
per cent of our oil from foreign
countries,” he predicted.

“For fifteen years the oil industry

has been saying that the U.S. was
going to be running out of oil and we
should be concerned with this prob-
lem,”’ he said.

“But I don’t think it’s as much the
fault of the government as it is the
American people who don’t believe in
an oil shortage.”

‘*‘How do you get people to look
down the road 30 to 40 years instead
of just two years to the next election?
I don’t have the answer,”’ continued
Clewell.

He explained how he felt the
government should arrest America’s
decline in oil production, saying that
America should increase in its use of
coal.

‘*We’re sort of like Saudi Arabia
and oil when it comes to coal,’’ he
said,adding, ‘‘We have a great abun-
dance of it but we use gas where in
many places we should use coal.”

Clewell also advocated the
increased use of nuclear power. ‘‘I

think we should go ahead and put
more nuclear power plants he

“Europe is doing it,’’ he explained.
The Soviet Union is doing it. This
doesn’t mean that we forget about the
environment.”

Another way to increase our oil
production he said was to open up
more areas of the U.S. for drilling.
‘There are many virgin areas, partic-

ularly in off-shore areas where we're |
getting |

now having problems
permits,’’ said Clewell.

“The oil business has taken a :

beating in the last two years,’’ said
Clewell. ‘‘We are the victim of a
public lash-out because we’re the
handiest people to blame when the
publi’ gets concerned about the rise in
prices: :

“We feel this attitude is expressed
an awful lot by the T.V. people; we
ddh't feel they give a complete
pictlre,”” he continued.

Clewell further explained that

Mobil had tried to buy time on
television to present what they felt
was their side of the issue.

‘‘We were constantly turned down.
It’s controversial and they said
they’re the only ones who can talk
about it,’’ he said.

Clewell dispelled the myth of huge
profits by the oil companies. He said
that Mobil made an average of only
1.5 cents on every. gallon sold. He
declared, ‘‘I think this reflects the
measure of efficiency of the oil
companies in that we operate on that

‘small a profit. Also you have to look

at our investments in refineries,

off-shore drilling platforms and so
forth.’’

Clewell also pointed to the $200
million Mobil pours into environ-
mental protection.

He said this money was used to
remove sulfur dioxide from smoke-
stacks, clean up tankers to help
prevent oil spills, and clean up wastes
from refineries.

He also said that Mobil is con-
stantly experimenting to improve its
methods of oil exploration.

“Only 12 per cent of all exploratory
wells yield any oil,’’ he said. ‘‘And
only two per cent find commercial
oil.”’

Although exploratory wells repre-
sent only 10 per cent of all oil wells,

-Clewell said that they were the most

expensive.
business,”’

“This is a very risky
he explained.

Clewell also scoffed at the idea of an
oil monopoly. ‘‘A monopoly causes
inefficiency. I don’t think there is a
more competitive industry than the
oil industry,’’ he said.

‘There are 25 major oil companies.
Compare that to the T.V. industry or
the auto industry. I think you’d have
a hard time finding another industry
today with 25 major companies,’’
Clewell continued.

‘You've got to have big institu-
tions though, because this is a big
country. People don't realize just how
big'this country is and how big our
government is. It has a budget into
the trillions of dollars,’’ he said.

‘But for all this we have about the
most stable government in the world.
America’s resiliency: is really some-
thing,” he concluded.
