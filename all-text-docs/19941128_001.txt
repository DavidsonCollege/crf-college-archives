When asked why some of this
year’s freshmen are not receiving
100 percent financial aid for their
demonstrated need, Dean of Ad-
missions and Financial Aid Nancy
Cable Wells says, “It’s a very, very
complicated issue.”

In the spring of 1992,
Davidson announced that it would
soon be unable to meet all need-
based financial aid demands. The
class of 1998 is the first class to be
affected by the limitations.

Trustee policy now limits fi-
nancial aid to 13 percent of the
overall college budget. “A very
few students are not having their
needs met now,” Cable Wells says,
and “most students are still getting
the help they need.”

Continuing to provide for ev-
ery demonstrated financial need
posed a dilemma for the college
budget. Cable Wells says, “Finan-
cial aid had been the fastest grow-
ing part of the budget. We were
pouring money into it, and it was
encroaching on other important
areas of the budget.”

Cable Wells says the change
“makes it hard to do everything we
want to do” in the financial aid
Office, since there are still about as
many needy students as there have
been every year for the past de-
cade.

Cutting financial aid, how-
ever, means not having to raise
tuition as much-each year. Slow-
ing the rate of tuition increase “will
hopefully keep more and more
people from needing financial aid

each year. It helps put the situation
in balance,” says Cable Wells.

Despite recent efforts,
Davidson does not meet our
needs, say some African
American students.

The Davidson Class of 1995 still remem-

| bers the intense racial tension created by an

incident in the 1991-92 school year, which
forced students to confront the issue of racism.
In the intermittent years, the campus has made
special efforts to fulfill the needs of minori-
ties, specifically African-Americans.

“I remember having to justify my pres-
ence here to myself and others. Now, I think
there is much more awareness of cultural
differences,” says senior Nikki Liverman.

graduate Tony Perez, Assistant to the Director
of Career Services, organized a weekend ori-
entation for minorities. Perez hopes that the
weekend will expand into a four-week semi-
nar, with incoming freshmen taking classes
with professors and talking with speakers about
life as a minority. This program is an augmen-
tation of the two-week program already headed
up by Dean John Eaves.

“One weekend is not enough. The four-
week seminar would encourage leadership
development, give a support group, and give

minorities a head start.” He plans to submit a
detailed request to the president Mad the fall of
1995.

Perez also scheduled a speaker on the topic

“How to Survive on a. Predominantly White

Campus” for Monday, November 14. The
speaker canceled at the last minute. The forum
will be rescheduled for next semester.

Black Student Coalition

The Black Student Coalition gives Afri-
can-Americans a place to be themselves. In
rebuttal, President Charlie Blake states that
“BSC continues to provide a social outlet for
African Americans, and:a ‘center for aware-
ness of differences.” They hosted a spaghetti
supper at the beginning of the year to attract
a diverse group of new members.

The Davidson College Chap-
ter of the American Chemical So-
ciety celebrated National Chemis-
try Week by giving demonstra-
tions at Discovery Place. They
demonstrated chemistry for chil-
dren from November 5 through 12.

A group of ten students and
four professors participated in the
demonstrations of making GAK,
slime, and ice cream for children
and adults who attended Discov-
ery Place two weeks ago. In the
Instant Ice Cream demonstration,

ice cream mix is stirred together
with liquid nitrogen. The cream
freezes, a cloud of nitrogen gas
rises from the bowl, and ice cream
remains in the bowl.

This society started this se-
mester because their participation
will be “beneficial to the careers of
its members either in graduate
school or medical school,” accord-
ing to President Theo Curey. There
are about 13 members with two
advisors, Dr. Ruth Beeston and Dr.

SGA unanimously passes resolution demanding

removal of Christian requirement for religion professors

By Meg Wolff

The SGA unanimously voted
on Tuesday to submit a resolution
to the Board of Trustees which
would officially allow non-Chris-
tians to become members of the
Religion Department.

The SGA raised this issue in
response to the discovery of an old
college constitutional by-law

which prohibits professed ‘non-
Christians from teaching religion
at Davidson. The resolution states:
“The Christian faith is not a neces-
sary qualification for professors to
teach such diverse courses as Bud-
dhist Traditions, Chinese Popular
Belief, and Modern Jewish Litera-
ture.”

Rosenbach says, “The idea of be-
ing taught Buddhist traditions by a
Buddhist monk, for example, is
just very exciting to me.”
Rosenbach encouraged the
resolution because he feels the col-
lege by-law, which requires any
professor hired by the Religion
Department to be of the Christian

part of the college’s Statement of
Purpose: “The loyalty of the col-
lege thus extends beyond the Chris-
tian community to the whole hu-
man community and necessarily
includes an openness and respect
for the world’s various religious
traditions.”

reported to the SGA on November

nated the requirement in the past.

The resolution, which passed
unanimously in the SGA meeting,
will now be sent to the trustees.
