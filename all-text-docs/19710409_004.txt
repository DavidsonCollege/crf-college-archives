PAGK FOUR APRIL 9, 1971:

Whose Guilt?

The war goes on.

Behind the Calley verdict and the inevitable re-
actions to it, behind the most recent White House and
Pentagon propaganda concerning more withdrawals
and de-escalation and success, behind all the new
facts, figures, opinions, charges and counter-charges
being tossed around in “revelant conversation,” this
one reality continues to stare us in the face—the
war goes on, and there is no end in sight in the near
future.

Much of the blame-has been levied at the mili-
tary mentality represented in the Calley trial. How-
ever, it is beginning to become more and more evi-
dent that perhaps the military is one of the most
humane institutions in our inhumane society. It is
the monster of a Frankenstein society, a monster
which can occassionaly dispense justice, while its
creator cannot, as has been demonstrated by the re-
actions to the Calley court martial. :

Indeed, the sickness reflected in the inilitary
establishment is simply the result of the pervasive
disease infecting the American people. When Calley
was found guilty and responsible, this country was
found guilty and responsible for the atrocities of war
committed in Vietnam. And the reaction of the vast
majority of Americans showed that this country is
not yet willing to face that responsibility, that we’ve
reached the point when the death of a man, even if
he is our our enemy, no longer affects us.

Such crass indifference is not excluded from Da-
vidson life. The Davidson Peace Coalition, the com-
munity’s only active organization working through
legitimate means for peace in Vietnam, has done
much to promote concern, but less than a fourth of
the college community (including administration, fac-
ulty and students) have responded. Most people will
say that the war must be stopped, but few can over-

- come their apathy to work for its end.

Yet the war goes on...

Economics 101-1

°

The strange economics of the adininistration-stu-
dent relationship, which seems to have very littte in
common at times, with Economics 101, have gone
into operation again with the latest decision on fi-
nancial aid.

It seems to be a particularly poor choice of time
to make the decision to cut the financial aid of the
incoming freshman class when one realizes that their
costs in attending Davidson will be at an all-time high
next fall.

Davidson College likes to say that it deals:in a
unique product. This may be truer than ever in the
future if the present costs are matched with the new
financial aid decisions. The products may eventually
evolve into the picture of the Davidson student that
the admissions office has attempted to some extent
to change, the upper middle class country clubber.

- One of the proudest claims in the catalog has
been that Davidson provides financial aid equal to
the financial need of ,each student. Next year that
passes by the board and all financial aid becomes com-
petitive.

High school work and performances are not a
completely reliable guide to the performance of an
individual at Davidson. Students who have been ac-
cepted off the waiting list have made very strong
contributions to Davidson and the community. These
ay the people at the bottom of the list for financial
aid,

Back to Economics 101. Davidson is marketing
itself to students. Without the entering freshman
class each year it would not take a long time for
the institution to vanish, (the Continuing College
Community might hold on a little longer).
To remain competitive in the market for incom-
ing students, Davidson has ,to overcome several handi-
caps which are rather well known to students. It
doesn’t. need the added burden of increased costs and
lowered financial aid which may influence the less
than affluent ‘to search elsewhere for their diplomas.
Hopefully the new fund raising apparatus has the
needs of the financial: aid department as well as the
Ovens-Little Library in mind. The college will need
the money for both,

Strong

Violates Rights

In ‘Groove Tube’ Ban

I§s.% sad thing to have to
write a column twice, esp-

ecially when you have to
take somewhat inconsistent
point of view the second
time around,

Several weeks ago in con-
nection with the coming of
Rennie ‘Davis I wrote a co-
lumn supporting the right
of the SGA Senate to choose
the speakers whom it de-
sires On Campus.” oe

At that time | stated that
the main issue was the right
of the senators to make de-
cisions_on_the—basis-of their
personal evaluations, rather
than ‘the desires of parts of
their constituencies.

Now Lester: Strong, Union
Board President, has used
the same Burkean argument
to justify cancelling ‘the
showings of ‘‘Groove Tube”’
on the basis that it did not
fit in with his conception of
what he should program in
the union for students.

I agree with Strong's con-
tention that election gives
the leader the right to decide
against the will of the elec-
torate on certain issues.
Yet I disagree that he in his
position as College Union
President ought to have can:
celled the ‘‘Groove Tube"’
when the sentiment of a
large portion of the student
body was clearly in favor
of the showing.

That paragraph may seem
to contain a basic inconsis-
tency, but | think it may be
resolved through considera-
tion of the difference in na-
ture between the roles of the
senate and the union presi-:

Bobby Allen

dent and board.

Strong is not in my opinion
elected to determine what
entertainment the students
will have available to th®m.

The purpose of electing a
College Union (President is
instead to have students in-
volved in the running of the
union so that it will be re-
sponsible to the student body
as well as to the adminis-
tration through the Director
of the Union.

ANDERSON

The president and board
menibers are: to procure en-
fertainment for students as
their representatives, and as
such to get what the students
wish.

In the absence of clearly
expressed desire for a par
ticular show, the board must
choose among the available
ones. But when the students
clearly want a_ particular
show, then the board should
attempt to bring it on cam-
pus.

The reason for this is that
Strong and the Union Board
have contro] over all of the
monies which are earmark-
ment in the union, which for
many students is the sole
entertainment opportunity

on campus.

It was suggested, at the
time of the “Groove Tube’’
cancellation, that some other
student organization might
pay for the showing. How-
ever, no existing group re-
presents all of the students
the’ way the union does or

” has. available funds and fac-

ilities for such a showing.
The only exception is the
senate, which, however, is
not properly involved in the
provision of entertainment
for the student body.
Strong’s-contention-on-that
Tuesday that besides the stu-
dents he also had to repre-
sent the administration, and
the trustees is nonsense. *

He was elected from and
by the students alone, the
money and facilities which
he controls are for the pur-
poses of the students, and
his only constituency is the
student body.

Strong attempted to set
himself up as the arbiter
of what students should see
when he cancelled the
“Grove Tube’’ on the basis
of his ‘‘programming  con-
cept’ (Whatever that is).
That is not a proper part of
his job.

Strong’s denial to students
of the opportunity to make
their own judgement of the
entertainment value _ of
“Grove Tube” is a denial of
that basic fact. And his limi-
ting the nature of the stu-
dents’ only collective enter-

_tainment outlet is a contra-

vention of the purpose of his
election.

Miss Blue Ridge Represents
City, Orthodontist, Florist

We got lost trying to find
Cave Spring High School and
were late for the Miss Blue
Ridge Valley Beauty Contest.
The cop on duty at the door
gave us a dirty look as we
piled out of Chris’ van: Chris,
who looked like a redneck
whose barber had been dead
several months, two Viking
hookers and their mother, a
Mother Chuckers cheerlead-
er (the Mother Chuckers are
the Hollins Frisbee team),
the other and me.

The usher showed us to
our row with a dirty look
just as the three-piece com-
bo direct from the Black
Garter Supper Club was get-
ting heavy into “A Pretty
Girl is Like a Melody.”

Then the Miss Somebody
of 1970 came out and said
how this was such a great
experience for all the girls,
and how at Atlantic.City the
girls did everything a girl

could do in a week, and how

you really got to know
your state by attending bank
openings and _ everything.
She. had a mouth. like the
grill off an Edsel. © :
Then Miss Edsel introduc-
ed the 11 lovely contestants,
all vying for the chance to

wear the crown of Miss Blue
Ridge Valley and the chance
to represent her city and
orthodontist at the Miss. Vir-
ginia Contest. One by one
the 11 lovely contestants
(who get to know and love
each other during the hectic
week prior to the contest)
came out and did her re-
spective talent thing. It was
pure dynamite.

There were four modern-
jazz-ballet-toe-tap dancers in
black sequined outfits which
showed just enough
to let the judges know they
were sexy but virginal, five
girls who sat on stools and
sang the same arrangement
of five pop songs, a girl who
recited Patrick Henry’s
speech in her brother’s tux-
edo and looked like a pen-
guin, and a fat girl who had
a lot of guts and played the
electric Wurlitzer like the
lady who plays the national
anthem at the Coliseum.

Then .came_ intermission
We took our own vote for the
winner. The vote was tied
between a girl who looked
like she was smuggling musk
mellons to Mexico and a
male tap dancer from Miss

skin-

Belinda’s.

When you're a finalist you
get to show off your grace,
poise, intelligence, and im-
agination by ans.wering
questions like ‘If your house
was afire and you only had
a chance to save one person,
who would it be?” To which
the correct reply is, ‘‘Not
wanting to show favoritism,
I would not try to save any-
one but would administer
Extreme Unction to my en-
tire family.”

Then after that eternity
while the judges are mak-
ing their final decision, THE
NEW MISS BLUE» RIDGE
VALLEY FOR 1971 IS...
BETTY LOU BENSON. And,
she accepts the bouquet of
red roses and the kiss from
the outgoing Miss Blue Ridge
and the kiss of Miss First-
Runner-Up who didn’t real-
ly want it anyway, and puts
on a genuine imitation fox
cape and walks down the
runway while Lloyd Cooter
sings and Betty ._Lou cries
and you know that those
years at Miss Belinda’s and
those braces and doing with-
out Hershey Bars for the
last.five years have all been
worth it because this is it.
