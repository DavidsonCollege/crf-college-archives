Boy Scouts

Smith and MacLaughlin Met
To Discuss Plans With
Scoutmasters

On Sunday afternoon, Oc-
tober 10, Shaw Smith and Bill
MacLaughlin met with the
scoutmasters and assistant
scoutmasters at the First Pres-
byterian Church in Mooresville
to discuss the possibility of
several Davidson boys helping
out with the scout work there.

The chief purpose of the mecting.
was ta see how many boys would
be needed for the work ard to work
out a plan and program’ whereby
the boys going up would have the
rank of assistant scoutmaster in the
troop to which they were assigned,

The main problem that presented
itself to the group was the matter
of transportation for the Davidson
boys between here and Moo:

However the need for som
help out in the work is
sO urgent that the scoutmasters in
Mooresville furnish all

agreed to

transportation.

Bill MacLaughlin pointed out
that this is a new field that the
Y. M. C. A. is working in, and that *
there are plenty of opportunities

work
to help out as there are at this time
He

to qualify

hine scout troops there. also

said however = that for
this work a boy must have reached
at least the rank of Star Scout.
Those who would be interested in
his branch of “Y" work are asked
to contact either Bill MacLaughlin

or Shaw Smith.
