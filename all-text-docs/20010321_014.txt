The women’s tennis team triumphed over
Liberty 4-0 on March 12. Due to inclement
weather conditions, the team was unable to
play both singles and doubles. But the bad
weather did not seem to affect its play.

The Wildcats needed only one hour to
sweep all matches, dropping only two games
in the process.

Two days later, the women played their
first conference match against Chattanooga.
After dropping the doubles point, they en-
tered the singles in need of four wins. They
fell short of this goal by only one match and
lost 4-3.

Excellent singles performances came from

Kelley Cantrell, Catherine Rainbow, and
Katherine Hatch.

In the third match of the week, the women
lost 7-0 to Western Michigan, a team ranked
No. 71 in the International Tennis Associa-
tion rankings.

“Although we lost, the girls showed a lot of
heart and never gave up,” said coach Jeff
Franks. “The other team set up the points and
executed, there wasn’t much we could do.”

The women took on Dennison on Satur-
day, and this time they won the doubles point
with two great performances by combina-
tions Kelley Cantrell/Gayle Jones (#2) and
Catherine Rainbow/Katherine Hatch (#3).

In the singles, junior Kelley Cantrell (No.
3), freshman Katherine Hatch (No..5), and
sophomore Catherine Rainbow (No. 6) won

their matches, bringing the score to 3-3 with
one match still in play.

Sophomore Gayle Jones gave the Wildcats
the 4-3 victory with a close win over Valeria
Muradov.

The women will play Western Carolina on
Friday at 3pm.

The men’s tennis team had a busy week as
well, beginning on Monday against Liberty.
The men stole the doubles point and took that
momentum into singles, where they didn’t
drop a single match.

Against Chattanooga on Wednesday, the
men dropped the doubles point, but the num-
ber two doubles team of Winebarger and
Gould (#2) put in a good showing and man-
aged to win their match (score).

On Saturday, the Wildcats also played the

Swimming closes season on high note

Davidson S.1.D.

Even though the men’s team amassed only
one win and the women notched three this
season, the year ended on a high note for
many Davidson swimmers. With a total of 35
personal best times set at last weekend’s
season-ending Colonial Athletic

Association’s Swimming & Diving Champi-
onships, the 2000-01 season will be remem-

bered as one of personal improvement for
Wildcat swimming.

Senior Kurt Hirsekorn got the ball rolling
on the first night of the CAA’s when he
shattered the school record in the 200 IM.
Three other school records were broken by
the men’s team during the weekend. Hirsekorn
also broke the old record in the 200 breast
with a time of 2:03.48. In the 200 fly, fresh-
man Charlie Hunter broke a four-year mark
previously held by Scott Harper. Senior Matt

Thirty-five swimmers set personal best times at last weekend’s

season-ending Colonial Athletic Association Swimming & Diving

Championships.

West’s first leg of the 400 free relay also
shattered a Davidson record. West’s 47.09 in
his 100 yard leg was .15 seconds faster than
the previous top Davidson time in the 100
free.

Two women swimmers broke school
records in the CAA Championships as well.
Freshman Sara Laws destroyed the previous
200 back mark by over two seconds, touching
the wall in 2:02.36. Laws finished second in
the event and also came within .63 seconds of
qualifying for the NCAA “B” Champion-
ships. According to Head Coach Jim Conlon,
that was the closest a Davidson woman has
ever come to. qualifying for the NCAA’s.
Fellow freshman Joanie Gidas swam the 200
breast in 2:25.00, breaking the previous school
record by almost a 1.5 seconds.

For the entire season, both teams combined
to notch 58 top-10 performances in Davidson
history. Last season, even with more swim-
mers on both squads, Davidson could only
muster 51 top-10 performances.

“This was a great year for personal im-
provement,” noted Conlon. “Every guy on
the team swam at least one personal best at
CAA’s. Even with a limited amount of women
swimming at CAA’s, I was impressed with
the number of top-10 times we were able to
record.” :

The waters may be calm now, but soon the

’ Wildcats will be back shooting for even more

records to shatter.
