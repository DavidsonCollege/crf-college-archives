Problem Into Committee

DRINKING RULE ISSUE

Student Council Shuttles

By JOHN BAILEY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Student Council Monday night sent the drinking question to a newly formed
special committee, thus delaying final action for at least “three or four weeks,” ac-
cording to Student Body President Will Jackson.

In an attempt to reach a de-
cision as to whether or not
Honor Court Chairman Hugh
Allen's suggested liberaliza-
tion of the drinking rule should
be accpeted, Jackson appoint-
ed Tommy Heffner chairman
of a committee to study the
problem. .

The controversy is one which
would allow the Honor Court
some leniency in its decisions
on enforcement of the drink-
ing regulation. On Sept. 21
Allen ask the council if the
word “ordinarily” could be in-
serted in Article 8, Section 2
of the Student Body Regula-
tions so the section would
read “Every student found
guilty of violation of this re-
gulation shall ORDINARILY
be suspended from the College.”

Jackson emphasized the dif-
ficulties incurred in changing
the regulatons and urged that
the committee give careful con-
sideration to any suggestions
it might have to offer when
called upon to report.

Fred Sackett opened the
Student Counc] meeting with
a report concerning the “still
liberal], but moderating” Na-
tional Student Association sum-
mer Congress and the regional
NSA meeting. a

He and President Will Jack-
son questioned the value re-
ceived from sending delegates
to the national Congress. Both
felt that perhaps the money
could be better spent.

Sackett stressed the improve-
ment of Davidson's position
on the regional level and said
Davidson must continue to con-
solidate its position in NSA

and try to strengthen its rela-
tions with the other members
of the region. He believes
Davidson would benefit at the
regional level.

John Barrow, Freshman
Advisor and chairman of Fresh-
man Court, told the council
that 22 freshmen had been
turned in for violations of
freshman regulations. He said
that the response of the upper-
classmen had been good and
that Jesse Sims Jed in the Joe

in the largest number of fresh-

man violators).

The council decided on the
regular meeting time of Mon-
day nights at 7 p. m. It con-
cluded its meeting by asking
that any suggestions on the
parking situation on campus
bé passed on to John Gresham,
Traffic Committee representa-
tive, or to the Dean of Stud-
ents’ office.

To Present Coriolanus

Simon Blackford, English
Richardson scholar, has been
east for the title role in the
Drama Department’s upcoming

production of Shakespeare’s
Coriolanus.
The play, one of Shake-

speare’s political tragedies, was
long neglected, and only with-
in the last few decades has it
been performed with any great
frequency. Coriolanus poses
the question, “Can one have
too much integrity to be a poli-
tician?”, and explores the rea-
sons why someone becomes a
traitor to his own country.

The director, Rupert Barber,
plans to present the production
Nov. 5, 6, and 7, a scheduling
which he believes timely,
“since that week will be the
climactic one in the current

Davidson Fellowships Plan
Agenda On Fall Program

The Westminister Fellowship
and the Methodist Student Fel-
lowship are currently begin-
ning their fall programs, deal-
ing with the needs and pro-
blems of the Christian Church.
The former will sponsor a serv-
ice project this Saturday, while
the latter will hear a concert
of liturgical jazz at its meet-
ing next Friday.

The WF's service session will
start at 2:30 >. m. Saturday.
Following the work project
will come a brief meditation
and supper at 5:30.

Charlie Raynal, WF presi-
dent, also announced the
scheduling of a program on
‘The Church in Politics,” to
be given next Friday. The 7:00
p. m. meeting will feature
guest speaker Dr. Philip B.
Secor, assistant professor of
political science. Dr. Secor will
stress the political role of the
church as a whole, as apart
from that of the individual
Christian. ;

Bill Rule, WF vice-president,
mentioned that a visiting group
from Queens College will be
present at the meeting and

Field Day Date Set

yd. low hurdles and the begin-
ning of the volleyball game.
Other events to be included
are the 100 yd. dash, the 880
yd. the 440 yd. relay, the tug

and the egg toss. The fleld day

that refreshments will be serv-
ed after Dr. Secor’s addess.
George Brown, secretary-trea-
suer, emphasized that the WF
has no formal membership and
that anyone interested is in-
vited to came. The WF state-
ment of purpose “hopes to
present .... an awareness of
the demands being made upon
an over-affiuent church by the
real needs and passions of a
real world”

The Methodist Student Fel-
lowship, having already met
twice, is looking ahead to the
Oct. 9 program, “The Cooi-
ness of God.” The highlight of
the meeting will be a concert
by the Sid Farrar Trio. The
Trio, which is composed of
Mark Hanson, Dave Hoag. and
Sid Farrar, will perform an
original church liturgy in jazz.
An open discussion of their
experiment will then follow.

According to Decker Faw,
MSF president, the chief ob-
jective of his group is “to re-
cognize the need of the church
for involvement in social con-
cerns.” To further stress this
point and to encourage attend-
ance, he emphasized, “This is
not a ‘church’ group.”

As a good example of the

MSF concern with concrete]:

realities, Faw mentioned the
recent October 2 program.
“Subsidized Athletics at David-
son.” The three speakers and
discussion leaders were Dr.
Pau) A. Marrotte, head of the
faculty committee on athletics;
Dr. William G. McGavock, pro-
fessor of mathematics; and Dr
Tom Scott, director of athletics
and physical education That
program and all subsequent
ones will be aimed at putting
“Christianity in an excitne
guise.”

The other officers, Steve Gra
ham and Don Davis, joinec
Faw in reminding all interest-
ed students that the MSF has
its regular supper meeting
every Friday night at 6 in th:
Davidson Methodist Church.

political campaign.” Nov.
will also be Freshman Parents’
Day:

The play has a large cast of
nearly 50 persons and will re-
quire about 80 costumes. Bar
ber believes Coriolanus will
be of special interest to David-
son students because of both
“its emotional appeal and the
intellectual problems posed.
It's the kind of play we hope
will generate discussion on
campus,” he added.

Dr. Grier Williams is com-
posing special background
music which will be recorded
for the production by the Wind
Ensemble.

The leading female roles
have been assigned to Mrs.
Wilmer Welsh and Mrs. Brad
Thompson.

Other major roles will be
taken by Dr. Thomas Clark,
Alex Bernhardt, Ed Dwelle,
Dave McCorkle, Smith McKeit-
han, Robert Powell, Jim Shack-
leford, and Art Slaughter.

Also appearing will be Ken
Seott, John Callendar,
Guerrant, Ed Rude, Dennis
Phillips, John Feuchtenberger,
Sam Boyte. Bob Meek, Clay
Ford, Jim Selley, Mike Fitz-
patrick, Paul Monk, Ray Kytle,
Bill Vermilye, Mike Hunter,
Neal Martin, Marvin Sparrow,
Tommy Ashford, Ted Schabel,
William Murphy, George Wat-
kins, and Michael Light.

A call will be made within
the next few weeks for extras
to play spear-carriers. Barber
also needs some volunteers to
make about 40 pairs of Roman
shoes for the production.

Two other major productions
are planned for the year. In
February, Jean Anouilh'’s The
bes’ Carnival, a light comedy
set on the French Riviera, will
be presented. The third play
has not yet been selected.

Barber also plans to continue
the workshop series. This pro-
gram features shot one-act
plays that are student-directed

Pi Kapps’ Pontoon Boat
Takes First Regatta

By TED GLUSMAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Boat prices went sky high

in the Davidson College area
as three Pi Kappa Phi pledges
jetted to victory last Saturday
in the first annual Pledge Class
Regatta. The race included a
variety of weird crafts, rang-
ing from Early Seaplane to
Late Air Mattress by way of
Contemporary Tin Can.

The conglomeration of ves-
sels took to the water at 1.
When the starting gun went
off at 1:17, those boats still
afloat raced furiously toward
the marker bouy, with the
amount of boat above water
varying widely.

Possibly the gamest crew of
the race was that band of six
strong amms provided by the
Kappa Sigs. These three gallant
mariners took second place
early in the race, and with an
amazing display of stamina.
held it almost to the finish
line. The members of this
sturdy crew at first would com-
ment only, “The water was
wet,” but after prodding, broke
down and admitted that the
reason for the conversion from
paddles to arms as a means of
propulsion was that with the
added weight of paddles, ‘the
boat kept sinking.”

Among the slow starters in
the race were the “Thinking
Three of SAE” so-called be-

wr

cause their boat kept thinking
behind the starting line. Gresh
Bayne, who piloted this amaz-
ing feat of naval ingenuity,
gave several reasons for the
slow start: ‘‘We were hurried

into starting position. The tide

was coming in.” And referring
to the fact that the boat oc-
cupied slot number 13, “The

Greek letter fraternities have
claimed as “late pledges”
twelve Davidson freshmen who

have accepted bids, and their
pledging hiked the percentage
of Greek letter freshmen to ap-
proximately 77%.

Attempts by Sen. Gaylord
Nelson (D-Wis.) to amend —
and substantially change — the
Measure were defeated by a
vote of 43-10. The measure was
then passed by the Senate on
a voice vote.

The House Committee on

minor Senate amendments to
the measure on Tuesday thus
clearing the way for
House action, which is expect-
ed at any time. As there were
only minor changes in the

trouble is expected in the
House.
