American civilian dies in Nicaragua, Secord agrees to testify

By KATHERINE PRICE
Headlining events for April 21-30:
Around the World — Benjamin Er-

nest Linder, an American engineer work-
ing on a_ hydroelectric project in
Nicaragua, was killed. The Sandinista
government blamed the U.S. for the
death, citing the U.S.-backed contras as
murderers. Contra leaders claimed that

inder died amid crossfire, and that his
death was accidental.

In Geneva, the Disarmament Confer-
ence of the United Nations, which in-
volves forty nations, appears close to
agreement on banning all chemical
weapons.

Soviet leader Gorbachev’s apparent
concession to the U.S. on short-range nu-
clear weapons last week made U.S. offi-
cials optimistic about a possible super-
power summit in Washington this fall.
Since Shultz’s Moscow meeting with
Gorbachev, however, the Soviets have
complicated the issue of short-range nu-
clear weapons by demanding that elimi-
nation be linked to withdrawal of U.S.-

controlled Pershing | missiles in West
Germany, |

South Korean president Chun Doo,
Hwan killed debate about constitutional
changes, stating that reforms would have
to, follow the 1988 Summer Olympics,
hosted by Seoul. Pres. Chun Doo Hwan’s
action sparked protest.

Senate investigative committees for the
Iran/contra affair announced that Richard
Secord will be the first witness at hear-
ings to begin on Tues. Secord has agreed
to appear without immunity. Secord is
believed to have played a “middleman”
role in the arms-for-hostages scandal. In
a related story, fundraiser Carl “Spitz”

The Palestinian Liberation Organiza-___Channell pleaded guilty to defraudin g the

tion concluded its meetings on Sunday
reunited. Reorganization of the PLO
came after Chairman Yasir Arafat agreed
to sever ties with Egypt.

On Mon., the U.S. barred Austrian
Pres. Kurt Waldheim from entering the
U.S. Waldheim is believed to have been
involved in Nazi persecution of Jews dur-
ing World War-I]. Waldheim described
the U.S. action as “intomprehensible.”

Pakistan has asked the U.S. to lease
Pakistan radar aircraft. The aircraft,
which would require U.S. military per-
sonnel, would be used by Pakistan to de-
fend its borders from Afghanistan’s at-
tacks. —

Across the Nation — House and

government of taxes. Channell impli-
cated Lt. Col. Oliver North — a key fig-
ure in the Iran/contra affair — with
charges of conspiracy.

The’ House of Representatives nar-
rowly voted 218-214 on Wed. to approve
a trade bill «amendment by Missouri
Democrat Richard Gephardt. The
amendment would automatically link

U.S. trade policies to an assessment of

fair trade practices of other countries.
The vote was viewed as a signal to Japan
to end trade practices perceived by the
U.S. as unfair.

On Wed. , a Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee vote unanimously favored tearing
down the newly constructed U.S. .em-

bassy offices in Moscow. The vote of 15-
0 followed recent discovery that the new
embassy complex had been bugged.

Rev. Jerry Falwell made bold
changes within the PTL leadership, dis-
missing top aides to Jim and Tammy
Bakker. Harry Hargrove became the new
PTL chief operations officer.

A building collapse last Thurs. in
Bridgeport, Conn. left a dozen construc-
tion workers dead, with another sixteen
workers either presumed dead or mis-.
sing. Investigators of the L’ Ambiance

may have blasted too much rock at the
Site, creating a weak foundation.

In Economic News — Japanese
Pres. Nakasone met witlt U.S. Pres.
Reagan in Washington on Wed. to dis-
cuss trading practices which led to the
U.S. imposition of tariffs on Japanese
goods. The U.S. has been concerned
with the Japanese trade surplus with the
U.s. and Japanese violations of semicon-
ductor agreements.
