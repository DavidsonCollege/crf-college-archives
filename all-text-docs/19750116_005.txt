Five

Extern Program Encourages

Off-Campus Student Learning

‘ie Extern program recently
imiiated by the Office of Ex-'
periential Programs, is only
partially filled, according to
Director Ken Wood.

Extern will provide Davidson
students the opportunity to
work with college alumni
during the spring break in fields
students may be interested in
pursuing. ;

“‘We now have 16 applicants,
and the program can handle 20,
so we are still accepting ap-
plicants,’”’ Wood said.

The Extern program is
similar to one which is now in
operation at Swarthmore
College.

“It is hoped that a program
such as this will enable
students to focus their interests
and begin to direct them toward
vocational gdals;’’ Wood said.

The candidates for the
program will fill out ap-
plications expressing their
vocational interests and
' geographical __ preferences.
These, in turn, will be reviewed
by Wood and Director of Alumni
Affairs Howard Arbuckle,

“‘We are just beginning to tap
one of our most important
resources here at Davidson,
that of the alumni,” said Wood.

Once the Extern Students
program is defined, a_par-

ticular alumnus will be con- .

tacted by letter or the school’s
Watts line concerning working
to develop an internship oppor-
tunity.

Yet Experiential Learning
Office internships are by no
means limited to the Extern
program, according to Wood.

“One program called the
Tampa Term was inspired by
work done over the summer by
Davidsonian Editor Mark
Deaton. It will involve five
students spending spring term
in a rented house in Tampa,
Fla.,’’ explained Wood.

The students will be in the
Ybor City area, a predominan-
tly Spanish-speaking section,
and will be working on a wide
range of programs including;
health, education, and welfare.

According to Wood, ‘‘the
students will be working all day
and come together at night to
share their experiences.”

They will be spending time
doing a study of the human

dimensions of a city in an effort
to find possible ways to meet
the city dwellers needs.

Another program entitled the
Atlanta-Appalachian Plunge
Program will involve 12
students and one member of the
faculty.

According to Wood, ‘This
group will spend time on cam-
pus until May 19, researching
various aspects of human
problems at the. two
geographical areas.

“At the end of this research
period the student will be im-
mersed into the stream of
human problems and with the
aid of a™ professor and his
research he will make inquiries
into possible solutions,’ ex-
plained Wood.

Wood expressed disappoint-
ment that more students had
not taken advantage of the pro-
gram.

“The main purpose of this of-
fice is to offer students who may
be in a cloistered academic set-
ting the opportunities to come to
grips with real world needs,
problems, and issues,’’ ex-

plained Wood.

“Unfortunately,’’ Wood con-
tinued, ‘‘Davidson students ap-
pear interested but seem reluc-
tant to act on these interé8ts.

‘“Many students are too tied
up with the academic concerns
to accept the legitimacy of”
some of the experiential

programs,” continued Wood.

At present, approximately 50
students are involved in indi-
vidual programs. Some are now
working at a children’s home in
Barium Springs.

“One individual is taking win-
ter term and working at a child
care center in Washington,
D.C.,”’ stated Wood.

Recently a graduate intern
from UNCC came to Davidson
to work a few days in the area of
“Career and Life Planning.”
Such a program will help
students clarify life goals and
employment interests.

Wood hopes to see the Extern

program expand to make job
placement and internships
more accessible to students and
especjally to increase com-
munication with Davidson
alumni.

mentary category. Hal McCoy,
also a junior, won solo division
acting, in which senior Carroll
Ensley also made the finals. In
duet division, Ensley teamed up
with Geof Arapian, another

“Boys in the Band.”’

_Senior Tony Martin was a
finalist in the oral_ in-

terpretation category, while
Randy Sherrill and Rick Roy
Jance made the finals in humor-

ous and persuasive speaking,
respectively.

Coaches Jean Cornell and
Rupert Barber are very pleased
with the speakers’ showing at
Catawba and throughout the
season, especially in im-
promptu speaking, in which a
speaker is given seven minutes
to prepare and deliver a speech.

The coaches hope to havel
Harvard and_ Princeton
debaters come to Davidson this
spring, and to hold a major
speaking tournament sometime
next year, which will include
both debate and individual
events.

Davidson debaters take o
Wake Forest here today. .

...lrustee Committees Serve Davidson

{Continued from page 3)

Eight board members are elected
from nominators by the Alumni

Association and the current senior class.
All of these nominations must be alumni
of the college.

Florida Presbyteries

Two trustees are elected by and from
the Florida Presbyteries of Everglades
and Sewanee. These are the only Florida
Presbyteries represented.

“Way back--probably in the early
days of the Presbyterian Church U5S.,
Florida used to be affiliated with David-
son, but now its presbyieries support
Florida Presbyterian College.

“Two presbyteries have decided to go
with dual support of both Fla.
Presbyterian and Davidson. Georgia
and South Carolina Presbyteries sup-
port Presbyterian College in C]inton,
South Carolina; and South Carolina also
maintains :relations with Queens
College,” said Hall.

‘ ‘There exist some non-voting mem-
bers of, the board, called Ex-Officio*
Members. One of these is always the
President of the National Alumni.
Currently Blaine Kelly is the President
of National Alumni. The other ~Ex-
Officio member is the Honorable Sam

Ervin III.

Occupationally the at-large trustees
are a law school professor, a civic
worker, the president of Union
Theological Seminary, a physician, the
executive director of the Presbyterian
Foundation Inc., the president of
Georgia Railroad Bank & Trust Co., and
a retired executive of Proctor & and
Gamble.

The Executive Committee

The board is made up of one
Executive Committee, and ten standing

committees. Each committee has a.

chairman, a vice-chairman, committee
members, and an administrative liason.

The Executive Committee is chair«
by the board chairman. This committee,
made up of the chairmen of the other ten
committees, meets separately from the
rest of the board to discuss and approve
various boardyactivities.

Standing Committees

The ten standing committees include
Athletics and Physical Education,
Building and Grounds, Development,
Education, Finance and Management,
Religious Policy, Student Life and
Health, Honorary Degrees, Nominating,

and Resolutions Committees.' The en-.

tirety of college policy in these areas 1s
defined in trustee meetings.

Religious Policy

In the realm of religious policy,
Davidson said, ‘‘The school is a part of
the church and therefore the trustees
have a responsibility to try to make cer-
tain that the ultimate responsibility is
discharged.

‘“My committee has played a part in
the current program involving the
College. Church with the campus. It is
our hope that Rush Otey has a large
amount of functioning support in and

through the college church.

“In this way the Church will play a
youthful part in serving the student
body,’’ said Davidson.

Christians Tenured

“For example, during discussions in-
volving tenure, the committee met
many times with faculty committees
and with students. It was our concern as
to how, within the-framework of the
College Charter, the relationship might
be made to provide for each of these
groups.”

The continued existence of Davidson
College is a primary point of discussion
for trustees, Money must be had to run
the school.

Perpetual Fund Drive .

“The prime thing we have to worry

about is that we have a lot of money to

raise. Inflation is tapering off, and there
is indeed a tabling or plateau trend in the
economy but it is at a higher plateau
than we have ever seen it.

“Operating costs have doubled. We try
to think of how to handle this in terms
holding down tuition~”

“The private institution is becoming a
smaller and smaller part of American
college education. We have to compete
with state institutions supported by
taxes for students. The future right now
looks like a perpetual fund drive, ” said
White.

Monetary Rewards

There are no monetary rewards for
Davidson College Trustees. Although
the college freely pays for their tran-
sportation, most trustees either refuse
to submit expense account reports or
they give the money back to the school
after each year.

“{ find lots of rewards to being a
trustee. First, there's a happy
association with the institution. There’s
a happy asSociation with persons: ‘in-
terested in that institution. It is a reward
to think about the degree to which you
feel you’ve made some contribution.

“I find it rewarding to think about the
role of a Christian liberal arts college
and being affiliated with that college,”
said Hall.
