THE DAVIDSONIAN

Alumnus Comments On
Hitler’s Latest Coup

Rew J. H. Caligan Reviews
Taking of Czechoslovakia
By Nazis

Rev. J: H,
Davidson

Caligan, an alumnus
of College who at
present residing in Nice, France,
writes graphically of the effect that
Hitler’s seizure of Czechoslovakia
is making upon Europe. Rev. Cali-
gan toured the ill-fated republic
several months before it ceased to

is

exist.

Rev. Caligan expresses the shock |
that he felt as he read the head-
lines “Hitler in Prague” although
he and all of Europe knew that
the was inevitable. When
he visited there last summer he
noticed that Hitler’s gloved hand
was already tightening its crushing
hold on the prosperous little coun-
try. The propogandist agents were
already there stirring up coals with
threats and intimidations.

Czechs Certain |

The Czechs, however, were un-
waveringly certain that they would
win out against the Nazis. To them
it was inconceivable that Hitler
would ever enter Prague as its
In questioning some of the
inhabitants Rev. Caligan reports
that he soon found the contempt
that the citizens of this old capital
felt for the ruthless policies of the
Third Reich.

Caligan’s party saw the expressions
of the whole Czech nation as an

FOOTBALL. One of these per-
iodic educational storms that brings
to the public more noise than light
has hit the University of Pittsburgh
—and has all of the U. S. college-
town talking.

It all started over the announced
simon-pure amateur policy of the
and the resignation of
famed Coach Jock Sutherland (sup-
pesedly because of the new policy).
Students struck, meetings were be-
ing held, and statements flew back
and forth in the college and the
professional press.

So far as the college press is con-
cerned, collegians view the whole
thing as another step in the long
march to de-emphasize big-time
intercollegiate football. Here's
cross-section of opinion that will
give you an accurate idea of the
current trend of thought on foot-
ball and amateurism:

al facilities may rise and fall, and
students merely shrug their should-
ers in their lethargy. When there
