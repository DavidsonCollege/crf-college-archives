Clara Bow in her cinematic interpreta-

tions of the modern fAdpper has given the'|,

world a much needed word. Already the
term “IT” has come to denote, in sporting
parlance, that intangible quality—person-
ality, color, individuaiity, call it what you
like—which eventually wins the lasting
adoration of the sporting public.

Babe Ruth strikes out ina pinch with the
bases loaded; “Red” Cagte is thrown for
a fifteen yard loss on Navy's twenty yard
stripe; “Big Bilt” Tilden falls before the

‘smashing drives of Henri Cochet at For-
est Hills—and yet. the deafening roar of
applause reaches the same high note of
resonance as if Ruth had hit a home run,
or Cagle, made a -thrilling dash for a

touchdown, or Tildet had won the world’s |

tennis title in straight sets.

Only to sports writers, intimate friends,
and those who regard athletics as a pro-
fession comes the opportunity to meet
and know intimately the athletes in the
various sports. What of the enormous
army of fans whose closest contact with
the athletes must be made from the field
scats“Al a big league ball park or from
the side lines of a football stadium? Fan-
dom, at large, knows little and cares less
of the personal lives of the players off
the field.

Then, by what strange process of trans- |
mutation is it possible for certain individ-
uals to raise theiriselves from the ranks of
similarly clad teammates and so impreés
that great mass of humanity that their
every action, in fact their mere appear-
ance on the field, is met by vociferous
outbursts of acclamation?

There is not an outstanding athlete in
any sport but what is a master in his own
department or at his own position. In pro
fessional sports they are the most skillful
that money can assemble; in amateur
athletics they are the most capable that
coaches can develop—but it is my conten-
tion that it was not, for instance, just the
remarkable hitting and all-round play of
Ty Cobb that has endeared him to the
hearts of countless fans. Red Grange wap
a master of master halfbacks but did this
alone make him the idol that he was
and is? .

No, there is-soniTe Magnetic appeal, some
colorful) mannerism, that transcends
words, which clicks with the fans and the
lucky possessor of 1T is predestined to
take his place among the immortal stars.

Take Babe Ruth’s personality away
from him-and he would cease to be the
great drawing card that he is. He would
become a Hornsby, the only man who
may yet approach the Babe in the slug-
ging field. But Hornsby lacks IT—he is
devoid of the knack of self-exploitation.
His style of play is mechanically perfect—
he is content to perform in his habitual
brilliant, steady, methodical manner —
but he will never remotely approach the
Bambino as a magnet at the turnstiles.

Some day he may wear the crown that’

Ruth now possesses—but the diadem will
never rest as jauntily upon his head as it
now reposes upon the shiny pate of the
Sultan of Swat.

The American public toves shownman-
ship. Our very. lives, in this modern age
of miracles and absurdities, verge on the
spectacular, Few branches of athletics re-
main a novelty tot he vast majority of our
population. Countless other diversions
now vie with sports as attractions of
popular interest. Certain fire and dash,
something extraordinary, must attend a
sporting event to entice public patronage.

Promoters of. professional sports and
coaches of college athletics realize this
salient fact. Hence the slogan: PLEASE
THE PUBLIC. Ten years ago pitching
dominated baseball. Home runs were few
and far between. ,The national pastime
had become a monotony of strike outs
and low hit games. advent of the live-
ly ball and the abolition of freak pitch-
ing deliveries revolutionized the sport,
made hitting predominant, and revived
and increased public interest. Why? Be-
cause every game is pregnant with pos-
sibilities. Excitement is most intense; the
final outcome .always in doubt; the ele-
jment IT looms ever present in the form
lofa timely barrage of base hits.

There are two phases of football tech- |

nique that always make the fans cheeer
and whoop it up. There are end runs and

forward passes. A play around the. end |.

gives the spectator a much greater op-
portunity to follow the ball than'a plunge
off tackle or through center. One sees
component parts of-action that are usual-
ly hidden in mass plays directed at the

CUSTOMARY DRILL
FOR JUNIORS HELD

On Friday, October 4th, the Seniors of
the R. O. T. C. unit put the Juniors:
| through their paces. This drill took place
in front of new Chambers building.

The custom of the Seniors drilling the
Juniors on certain days has 'been in ef-
fect here for seyeral years. It is for the
purpose of familiarizing.the officers with
their new duties; suchas giving com-
mands and instruction td\the new men.

Each Junior was given a chance to
put the others through the close order
movements and also the manual of arras.
Errors were pointed out and corrected by
the Seniors who took charge of the units
and gave a good demonstration of how
it should be done.

receiver at the armory had given up hope of
finding anything and had “signed off.”

Profiting by this past experiment, the

line. It matters little whether a forward
pass is complete—it's the thrill of watch-
ing the pigskin Ay through the air that
brings the stands to their feet. Sensing
this the larger. colleges have built: their
offense around forward passers and end
runners. Why? Because the, open style
of play is the more spectacular. [t gives
the player with IT a much greater oppor-

tunity to “strut his stuff.”
Sports fandom has “endowed certain
athletes with all the attributes of an

Apollo-like deity whose duty, irrespec-
tive of his routine play upon the field, is
to see that the afternoon is untowched by
This “taken-for-granted” at-
titude on-the part of the fans is plainly
evinced by the stimulating, flutter of ex-
citement that grects the football star on
his team’s entrance into the stadium: or
expressions of delightful expectancy and
the chorus of: “Now, we'll see some
action” as some slugger takes his position
in the batter’s box.

The spectator, either consciously ér un-
consciously, seems to expect something
unusual to happen in such instances. Quite
eften they are disappointed—but, at other
times, the idol “comes through” and there,
is plenty to see, plenty to remember,
plenty to go home and talk about.

And so, whether it be brilliant red or
pale violet, the fans response to a bit of
color—a flash of [T—cannot be denied. If
fandom is to thoronghly enjoy the con-
test the game must be full of thrills inter-
mingled with frequent dashes o* individ-
ual showmanship.

Peyhaps you have often heard’
query: “Going to the game today?” and
the swift reply: “No. I wouldn't walk
across the street to see THAT team play.
Why, there isn’t an interesting man on it.”

The opinion is shared by thousands of
others. The teams boasting IT are the
ones the fans come miles to see.

In the words of the poet:

“He grabbed the bat,

He swatted the ball,

The fielders gazed in wonder—
That's all—Homer !”

“PRESCRIPTIONS”

“SABBATH” IS TOPIC
OF MINISTERIAL BAND

“Observance of the Sabbath, and Its
Meaning For Us Today.” was the topic
discussed at the open forum meeting of
the Ministerial Band last Sunday after-
noon in Shearer Hall. “Although no defi-
nite conclusions were, reached, the mem-
bers, finding the topic interesting and
worthwhile, are going to look up infor-
mation on the subject and continue the
discussion at our next meeting,” stated A.
B. McClure, viée-president of the organi-
zation, and the presiding officer in -the
absence of President F. D. Miller.

The various ways of breaking the
Sabbath in the present-day were dis-
cussed, in particular the growing practice
of the operating of picture shows and
baseball games on Sunday. The question
of studying and recreation on Sunday was
also taken up although no decision was
reached. According to McClure, a vote
will probably be taken next meeting atid
the the organization will reach a definite
conclusion as to what constitutes the
proper observance of Sunday.

About thirty ministerial candidates at- |

tended the mecting, although there are

over seventy enrolled in the college. How- |
ever, some of the men studying for the

ministry were out on deputations.

SCHEDULE PLANNED

It has been the custom in past years,
under Captain Pritchett’s direction, to
hold a series of inter-class sports through-
out the year. This year year as usual a
schedule has been mapped out in each
sport. :

The two major inter-class sports are
track and basketball. During the first
week of November, an inter-class track
mect will be held. By that time these
track men will be in the pink of condi-
tion, having trained for several weeks.
The Seniors are. under the leadership of
Lafferty, Juniors under George, Sopho-
mores under Wilson, and Freshmen under
Gorham and Kuykendall. Work«has al-
ready been started on basketball prac-
tice, also. Pritchett is coaching the Sen-
iors, Rusk the Juniors, Johnson the Soph-
omores, and Goodson the Freshmen.

Concerning the other sports, the box-
ing teams will get into training shortly,
volley ball games will take place in the
late fall, and as for inter-college campus
football, Captain Pritchett hopes to in-
tesest students in this popular pastime... -

. This year, as was the case last year,:

fthysical conditioning exercises will be

15, when the initiation of new members
and the clection of officers will take place.

Philanthropic

The Philanthropic Literary Society held
its weekly meeting Tuesday night; the
first of October. The feature of main in-
terest included the reading of two prize
essays, which were written by old mem-
bers years ago, when prize essays were
accorded highest distinction.

The first was read by J. W. McCutchan.
It was a story of mountain life in North
Carolina, combining exquisite description.
and wonderful narrative talent. The other
was read‘by W. T. Ratchford. It was an
excellent argument discouraging the plan
of the Allies to close their commercial re-
lations with Germany.
