Duke Professor Closes
College Lecture Series

Seven Men Have Spoken to
Davidson Students During _
Academic Year

ELLWOOD SPEAKS LAST

Committee Believes Year Most
Successful

With the address Monday eve-
ning by Professor Charles A.
Ellwood of Duke University,
the College lecture series for
this academic.year was termi-
nated,

Seven men have been brought to
Davidson this year by the lecture
committee; they are Mr. Alexander
Sprunt. Prof. Walcott of Long Is-
land University; Dr. Robertson,
President of Goucher College; Prof.
John Crowe Ransom of Vanderbilt
University; Rev. Herbert Johnson
of Winston-Salem; Prof. Barr of
the University ,of Virginia, and
Prof. Ellwood of Duke University.

The committee in charge of the
lecture series composed of Dr.
Shewmake (chairman), “Dr. C.K.
Brown, and Professor Lilly, feels
that it has been most successful
this year in securing such a note-
worthy group of speakers. Plans
for next year have not as yet been
formulated, but it is the objective
of the comnnittee to secure equally
as distinctive a group of men. There
is a possibility that Louis Unter-
meyer, the famous modern poet,
‘willgpe secured for a lecture series.

In order to: secure a diversified

group of speakers, the committee
receives’ its suggestions from the
Professors in those departments in

which the lecturer is a specialist.

and that it might have been averted
if either Great Britain or France
had conceded some of their African
colonies to Italy.

° Dr. Eliwood expressed his sur-
prise to find Switzerland becoming
militaristic in ideals.

He.said that Germany had chang-
ed greatly since the days of Iim-
perialism and that the people had
become very serious, grim, and sad.
Hitler is a man of | considerable
force who apparently understands
the German people and tlidir prob-
lems. He stated that he was aston-
ished to find the German people
submitting to Hitler's dictatorial
tule; but that Germany had been
faced with having and accepting
either Hitler's
or Communism,

National Socialism

He found Sweden to be a sort of
haven from the radical movements
rampant south of the Baltic where
a “new deal” that lies between cap-
italism and communism has been
developed. This movement they call
“controlled capitalism,” and it con-
sists of co-operative production and
merchandising with the right given
to the government to compete in
any field of industry with private
enterprifes. He said that he had
found Sweden to be the one Euro-
pean country enjoying real pros-
perity and possibly the only country
in the
budget.

world to have a_ balanced

He summarized Is lecture by
saying that.the maladies of Europe
were principally in the attempt of
each nation to isolate itself from
the others with the resulting dis-
trust and fear,

Dr. Ellwood spoke to the student
body at the chapel period on Tues-
day morning, March 17, on “The
Relation of Sociology to Religion,”
and later addressed a group‘of stu-
dents from Dr. Gwynn’s and Dr.
Hood's classes on “The New So-

on Tuesday night, March 9.

The main feature of the program
consisted of two talks, one by Bill

The most interesting part of the
first speech was a. description of
the native funerals in’ which the
mourners ‘and pall-bearers carry
the corpse in roundabout ways to
the burial ground. They go up
eross roads and around the block
(if they can be called “blocks”) in
spirits oO
the track and keep them from
haunting the dead person,

Woodward talked mainly about
the religion and dress of the inhab-
itants of the Philippines.

Each speaker held the floor for
twenty minutes. After this an open
forum was held in which questions
were asked and impromptu speech-
es made.

At the next meeting officers’ will
