~~ “Representation

2 «Jt is unfortunate, but the indications are that the
alumni do. not want the trustees who run the school
to-be in any way confused with the students who peo-
ee line with the automatic addition of students
to the boards of trustees at other institutions, it would
seem.that Davidson students might be equally (yepre-
sented on our board of trustees. oe
wr, 2The. hope for such student representation now
seems-to rest with the trustees themselves. In the
fraternity issue this year they have shown that they
can be more open to change, or radicalized more than
many of the present students on campus.

.. . Now.we must hope that they are more receptive
to change on this point of representation than, the
former, students who make up the alumni board
nominating committee.

Tt is unfortunate ‘that the alumni cannot see the
merits of the case after they are separated from the
Davidson campus. If the alumni will not elect recent

faduates (Tom Earnhardt) or even nominate present
sttidents, it lies with the trustees and trustee bylaw
changes to offer student hope for representation.

For Want Of A Buck...

-.,«»]t seems almost ludicrous that, at a time when the
college: needs desperately to work for student ap-
proval and support, the administration has again sac-
rificed. student concern and student’s rights for want
of a few more bucks. We are speaking, of course, of
the continual postponement of the drawing for dorm-
itory:. rooms. go

. The concern of the administration over the col-
lege’s financial situation is quite justifiable. However,
a such a concern comes before the college’s' re-
sponsibility to its students, a drastic shift in priorities
is in order.

~ The delay in room drawing is a nuisance to both
the students and to housing officials. The nearer
exams loom, the greater the anxiety becomes among
_ students and the harder the job of housing officials

becomes.

Moreover, if the drawing is postponed much long-
er, it will be necessary for students to choose their
rooms while trying to study for exams and writing
end-of-the-term: papers.

“It’s too late to urge that the administration con-
sider the 2 ibe that students are facing due to
the delay. The harm produced by such procrastination
has already been ‘done. :

We can only say now that we hope our admini-
strators will remember in the future that concern
ee students must come ahead of concern for the

_The Gordian Knot?

~~"Yet another example of-the growing lack of con-
cern: for student needs is seen in the new registration
,;procedures.-being instituted next week. Not only are
‘the students going to be inconvenienced by the new
method, but faculty members, already overworked in
‘many instances by the usual end-of-the- year work,
will also feel the irritating pinch of the proceduce.

We commend the Office of the Registrar for at-

tempting to clear up the confusing mess that normal-
ly gS era a registration. However, we cannot
‘agree that the solution to these problems which has
‘been offered in the form of the new registration pro-
cedure is at all suitable.

“i. In the first place, there is simply not enough time
given to the students to work out their schedules
' satisfactorily. There are just two days allotted for
selection of courses and consultation with advisers,
and only two hours given to each student to tramp
around campus to obtain his precious ‘course cards’’
from professors. ep

Also, this whole ‘procedure puts more work on
‘the students and the faculty in setting up courses
and classes for next term; than is necessary. Indeed,
the new: system has the possibility of becoming as
‘confusing and as hectic as the mass registrations at

In short, it appears that the ‘new look” registra-

_tion,. while. practical for administrative peatone, is
‘unresponsive to students and their problems and is
not the solution that is needed.

Davidson Experience Lies

"Twixt Hell And Heaven

It is a fairly common as-
pect of the human condition
that a good thing is never
recognized until it has been
lost to those who bardily
come to ‘appreciate it. As
one who is about to leave
these hallowed hails, I would
like to forward the idea that
this is true of Davidson.

The perfection the

are numerous things at Da-,

better phrase, iis called the

Granted, it takes ‘the bet-

a fact not ialtogether lament-

ters of the world without
having to pay the awful

try to hide the fact, the stu-

ity. Seratch the surface of

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Galbraith Used Old Text

To the Editor:

On Monday, the Reynolds
Lecture E@ries brought the
renowned Harvard professor
and economist, John Kenneth
Galbraith, to the Davidson
College campus. That night
he delivered ta lecture on
“Foreign Policy: The Next
Reform.”’

This speech was quoted
verbatim, (except for a few
of his dry, ‘New England-
ish,”’ witty side remarks),
from his canticle entitled
*‘Plain Lesson on A Bad Dec-
iade,’’ which was published
in ithe winter issue, 1970-71,
of Foreign Policy.

I will \jadmit thiaitt probably
a vast majority of the audi-
ence had not read the article,
but I hope we paid him $1200
for more than a  persenal
recitation of an article which
we lall could have read free
in the periodical room of the
library.

In the light of this experi-
ence, which I'am sure is not
an isolated incident, I feel
that we must seriously re-
consider our whole ‘‘lecture-

series’’ policy.
This week we expended
much more than we were

paid back, an action even
Mr. Gialbraith would admit
is bad economics. In the fu-
ture, will we go on wasting
our money?

To the Editor:
Parts of the mew curric-

ulum have been in effect for ~

three years, but much of the

‘Blue Sky program has nev-

er been realized. Since both
faculty amd students hiave a
stake in the intellectual en-
vironment of this college, I
urge that we clear the smog
of power struggle and con-

centrate on ‘a crucial . prob-
lem.

The problem is how to in-
sure that curriculum quality
and academic excellenee do
not dissipate in the rapid
rush ‘to supply ia wider offer-
ing of educational ‘alterna-
tives.

Curriculum changes in the
past three years have moved
away from the traditional
liberal arts program of ia re-
quired .core of courses in
many areas. Area require
ments remain, but with elec-
tive options.

The Honors College—is es-
tablished, foreign study ex=
panded and Career. service
envisaged, Exchan ges with
other schools have opened.
Pass-fail “options now exist
to encourage dabbling.

But some complain that
the curriculum is still’ rigid;
that it is rigid with respect
to evaluation. I grant that it
is more difficult to gauge
how much is learned from
independent. study than it Ys
to ‘test students on tthe con-
tent of a course, but this
does not give reason to ac-
cept shoddy work by those
pursuing independent study.

Two other opportunities are
possible. Davidson cian with-
draw from the educational
system. Professors, liaborato-
ries, libraries and programs
are educational services for
which ‘the student piays the
going rate. He, receives no
grades or degree, but he
gets ian education.

The other alterniative is to
continue as 1a degree gnant-
ing institution without grades
or with grades that do not
rigorously discriminate | jin
quality of performance.

Whether evaluation stand-
ards ,are stiff, lax or non-ex-
istent, students desiring an

ate study, followed by years
of initiation into the profes-
sions? To those who are frus-
trated by Davidson, ia perus-
al of the above should be a
frustration im itself: they
ain't seen nothin’ yet.

In a.few years, then, I
have little doubt, doctons,
lawyers, etc., willl look back
on their time spent here as
“the best years of their
lives.”

How else can one feel about
years spent in beauty, with
friends of nare quality and
leisure possibilities never to
be enjoyed agai. Some may
even regret that they didn't
‘approach the serious ques-
tions a litthe more seriously,
when they had the chance.

Although we are by no
means im Heaven, we are
certainly ‘at a good remove
from Hell. It's a shame that
more of us don’t recognize
the fact sooner: The outside
world looks challenging, but
pretty cold.

“

education will get it.

The second alternative does
not free ithe student from
cniticism, since one of the
functions of ‘a professor is to
stimulate students through
criticism. It does free him
from the pressure of playing
the siaitus game.

The third alternative con-

fers ‘a graduate status of
dubious worth.
The first alternative  in-

creases the value of ithe sta-
tus conferred ‘and the proba-
bility that the less motivated
student will emerge “from
Davidson with the education

‘ he came to get.

To the Editors

During ithe past six years
of Jim's illness, not a day
has passed that we haven't
been strengthened by ‘the in-
terest, love, and prayers of
you loyal friends. And now,
added ito all this, you have
made us the recipients of the
Fund for this
year. It is € very humbling
experience ‘to be loved in
such a beautiful way by
so’ many wonderful people,
and, undeserving though we
may be, we accept this ex-
pression of your devotion
with hearts filled with grati-
tude. ‘However, in doing so,

‘we feel deeply indebted to

you. Therefore, it is our hope
thatywe may not only make
you ‘aware of our sincere ap-
preciation, but also mepay
you in some form or other
for Caring ‘as you have done.
