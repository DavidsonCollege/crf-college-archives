It looks as if the gods were

guess up the flue. We still hold that
the Wildcats would have made a much
better showing against these W. & L.
and V. M. I. grapplers had they not
been without the services of Potter
and Sprunt. They put up a whale of
a good fight against superior odds,
however, and deserve a hand for their
spirit. Those two Virginia schools
have always had a reputation for put-
ting out good wrestling teams.

Those sharpshooting lads from State
came to town just before exams and
took the local quint into camp. Not,
however, until the 'Cats had forged
into the lead and held it for some few
minutes.,., The students seemed to be
slightly riled over the decisions in some
cases, but no blood was shed, so it
passed at that.

And speaking of tiiose sharpshoot-
ing Terrors from State, that team’s
stands during the past week have
made this reporter sit up and take
notice. The Raleighites have a smooth
combination there, and there’s no
question about it. Their close but sure
victory over Carolina, while it was
somewhat of a surprise, was something
to write home about. This year’s con-
ference race may be close yet.

To Carolina go our congratulations
for their splendid luck in getting Carl
Snavely to coach their 1934 grid edi-
tion. They should go places with a
man like Snavely behind the helm. He
has made a good record at Bucknell,
and seems to fit in with the Chapel
Hill bunch. Well, it looks as if all
North Carolina is holding the big time
coaches now. It would make the ole
boy terribly sorry if Davidson should
come out and lick a couple of certain
North State teams in 1934!

From all appearances they should
put up a mighty fine showing next
season, and should make
feltuin a general way. They have a
hard schedule ahead of them, but with
eleven lettermen from this year’s
team, and a fine group of reserves and
ireshmen coming up to fill in the va-
cancies in the line, there’s not much
left to hope for. You can quote this
reporter as saying that the Wildcats
will go places against the big boys.
Watch that Mackorell next season.
And he has plenty of support, too, both
in the backfield and in the line.

With the spring showing signs, it
looks like we might take 4 looksee at
thealightclad boys. (Who said spring? )
It appears. as_if some Wildcats would
be out ahead when the judges gather
on the cinderlanes this spring. Tle
Wildcats are headed for a champion-
ship year this season, in. the humble
opinion’ of the scribe. With Frazier,
Oakés, Merchant, and Morrow in the
distance events, Evans and Faison in
the dashes, and Lee, Pittman, Rhyne,
and Cochran in the field events, things
look good. The hurdles are well cov-
ered, too, with Pratt and McPhail tak-
ing the obstacles.

We owe an orchid to Schnozz Will-
son, before we commit a grave error
and forget. Recently, our readers will
remember, .he was picked for the
award of the Tim Pharr gold foot-
ball, given each year to the best block-
er on the football team for the sea-
son. Congratulations, Eb!

The Seniors walked off with the
volleyball trophy recently, when they
completed a_ perfect standing. The
Sophomores took a fairly close sec-
ond, losing only two games. One of
these was to the fourth-year lads, a

themselves

plenty close contest, too. Good team
these Seniors had.
It looks like the younger ’Cats

haven’t been able to get started as yet
on the courts, taking™it on the nose
twice in a row from the boys from
Charlotte. Maybe it’s just as well,
since it will show the ’Kittens they
haven’t an unbeatable combination.
They have excellent possibilties,
though, so don’t fool yourself.

The Wildcats were outclassed Mon-
day by a fast Wake Forest quint,
headed by a certain Mulhern, who is
certainly one classy player, if you
should ask us. He was the whole
Wake team. The Davidson boys were

In two basketball games just pre-

Newton and McEver face what. is
probably the hardest schedule that a
Davidson team has had in the past
several years. They have the best
prospects for a fine team that they
have ever had since coming to David-
son. Eleven of the forty candidates
are lettermen, and many of the others
are competent reserves. The freshman
team sends up some good line pros-
pects, which is the type of material
needed,

The triumvirate of backs which
made a name for itself in North Car-
olina last fall, Mackorell, Wingfield,
and Hutchins, are all on hand, and
Verble, Pittman, Yarboroughg Pearce,
and Bumgarner will be there to re-
inforce them. Legare, reserve back
who suffered a broken leg in the game
with Wake Forest, will not be able
to report for the spring practice.

This is the first year that teams
from Davidson and the University of
Tennessee have met in an athletic
way. Interest will be added to this

meeting by the fact that two of Da-

ing Tennessee men.

Wildcat Wrestlers
Lose toW & L, VMI

Sprunt, Potter, Lost to ’Cat Mat-
men in First Matches

In the wrestling: matehes which took
place just before the holidays, David-
son’s weakened grapplers took on two
strong Virginia teams, and were dis-
astrously defeated by both Washing-
ton and Lee and V. M. I.

In the meet with W. & L., the Wild-
cats were unable to take even one
match, hindered as they were by the
loss of two varsity wrestlers, Sprunt
and Potter. The boys from W. & L.
took every match to win by 30 to 0.
Blackwelder put up the closest fight,
but his opponent won on a time ad-
vantage.

A few days later, still without the
services of Potter and Sprunt, the Da-
vidson team went up against a strong
Cadet aggregation, and again were at
the short end of a lop-sided score, as
the V. M. I. boys took every match
but one, to win 25 to 5, Captain
Charlie Fort was the only Davidson
man to score, throwing his man to
tally Davidson's only points.

Potter, who has been out on account
of a strained muscle, is expected to
be back in the competition before
long, but it is doubtful if Sprunt, who
suffered a broken bone, will be able to
wrestle for some time, if at all this
year.

Best-Blocker Award

By a recent vote of the Davidson
coaches, Elbert Lane “Schnozz” Will-
son, Jr., of Athens, Tenn., was award-
ed the Tim Pharr medal, gold football
given each year to the man on the
Wildcat squad who shows himself to
be the best blocking back for the sea-

Willson, a senior, is a member of
the Pi Kappa Alpha social fraternity,
and president of the Athletic Council.
He has played in the fullback position
for the two years since he came to
Davidson from junior college, and ac-
cording to the coaches has showed a
good brand of football throughout.

The award has been made for the
past two years, being awarded by Rev.
Tim Pharr, of Cass, W. Va., who for-
merly attended Davidson, and was a
member of the football team. The
award was won last year by Bruce

Wake Forest’s Demon Deacons took
an early lead over the Davidson Wild-
cat basketball “team here Monday
night, and though the ’Cats rallied bril-
liantly in the last half, turned them

| back 34-25,

The victory practically decided the
fight over who should take the cellar
in the North Carolina Big Five race.
Although the ‘Cats led at one time,
it was only for a few minutes and
the Deacons, inspired by the fast shoot-
ing of Mulhern, soon stepped into the
lead,

The ’Cats staged several spirited ral-
lies during the game, but apparently
the lead acquired by the Deacons dur-
ing the first half proved too much for
them to overcome.

Harris and Ross of Davidson played
an outstanding floor game and were
the main threats of the ‘Cats’ attack,
while Jim Morgan starred on the de-
fense.

For the Deacons Mulhern and Swing
were the principal stars, Mulhern lead-
ing the scoring with 20 points to his
credit.
