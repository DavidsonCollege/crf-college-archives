Baseball Suffers on Losses

By Will Cobb

The Davidson baseball team
has found itself in a five game
losing streak following last week’s
competition. This skid immedi-
ately followed a three game sweep
on the road versus Furman.

Following this sweep,
Davidson traveled to Rock Hill,
SC to face former Big South rival
Winthrop College. After 7 innings
of play, the Eagles and the Cats
found themselves in a tie game at
4, butin the topof the 8th Winthrop
took a pitch over the left field wall
for the game winner and a final
score of 4-3. Freshman Brian Cole

pitched the whole game, giving up -

4 earned runs on 8 hits with 3
strikeouts and 1 walk, Brett Boretti
kept up his hot hitting by going 3
for 4 with 2 RBIs. The Cats would
then face Wake Forest for the third
time this season at home the fol-
lowing day.
The Cats’ luck versus ACC
- squads this year did not improve,
falling 14-5 to the Demon Dea-
cons. The game sat at 1-1 going
into the fifth inning, but the
Deacon’s bats lit up and put the
. game out of the Cats' reach. Brian
Krehmeyer (1-4) took the loss de-
spite giving up only 3 earned runs
on 5 hits in 4 1/3 innings. Senior

Rick Bender took a big step toward
the Davidson hitting record, going
3-4 with 2 home runs and 4 RBIs.

» Davidson would meet yet another

ACC team, Duke in their next
game.

Against Duke, the Cats were .

hit hard, hanging relatively tough
until the 7th inning when Duke got
hotat the plate, piling up a grimac-
ing 7 runs to extend their lead to
12-2. Davidson didn’t quitthough,

going onahomerun tear with three ©

2-run home runs by Jeff Andrews,
Clay Hall, and Jazz Freitas in the
next two innings to pull within 12-
8. But the rally stopped there as
Duke tacked on one more insur-
ance run, leaving the final at 13-8.
Brian Cole took the loss at the
mound. The team would then shift
back to Southern Conference ac-

,tion to face Georgia Southem at

home, the #1 team in the confer-
ence.

The Cats headed into the
double header having to face All-
American Todd Greene, NCAA
Division I’s 3rd all-time home run
hitter, along with pre-season all
conference pitcher Jim Carragher.
In game 1, Davidson took an early
lead, going up 3-0. The Cats got
started in the 2nd inning as Drew
Fassett knocked a pitch to right
