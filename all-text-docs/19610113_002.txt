A Plan: Student Evaluation

Dr. George B. Watts retires this
year.

Dr. Watts, professor of French, has
a professional reputation second to
none on the Davidson faculty.

Not content with reputation, he is
also a fine teacher.

At 70, he looks 60 and has the vigor
of a man of 50.

He is a dynamic personality, a dy-
namic teacher. He is certainly a mem-
ber of that mythical 95 per cent that
takes a dynamic interest in the en-
tire curriculum.

But Dr. Watts is 70 and around
here you have to retire at 70.

Maybe he wants to retire, but that's
beside the point. The point is that age
is a relative thing. Milton was reading
Greek at eight; Grandma Moses was
90 when she began painting.

Davidson has a few professors far
on the sunny side of 70 who should
have been put out to pasture long
ago. Hard and fast rules sometimes

hinder rather than help.

So what/s the solution?

We would suggest at least
solution -— and this would apply npt
only to when aging professors should
be retired, but to when poor profes-
sors should be fired.

Why not let second semester sen-
iors evaluate professors in their ma-
jor course? No one knows better than
a student who has taken courses in a
department for four years which pro-
fessors in the department are getting
their courses across.

We don’t suggest that seniors, in
effect, should be given the power to
do away with teachers who supposed.
ly are not doing a good job. We feel
strongly, however, that the students
are most closely associated with fac-
ulty members in their primary func:
tion — teaching.

‘After all, the dean of faculty and

other members of tne administration
don't attend classes. We believe that
they ‘necd a little help in deciding
who's doing his job and who isn't.

A Beer, A Gallon of Gas

“| deem it the public duty of every

man to devote a certain portion of

his income for charitable purposes;
and that it is his further duty to
see it does the most good of which
it is capable.”

Thomas Jefferson

Jefferson doubtless, would scoff
at ‘us.

Davidson's 1960 Christmas Gift
Fund, according to YMCA President
Jim Richardson, stands this year at
an all-time low total: about $2100.

It’s through no fault of the YMCA;
an ambitious publicity campaign and
fairly energetic solicitation were car-
ried on before Christmas.

The faculty can’t be blamed. Pro-
fessors set a record in Gift Fund con-
tributions; a major part of the total
is from the faculty.

One student wrote a check for fifty
dollars.

But by and large, Davidson's no-
toriously self-indulgent student body
(average dance weekend cost: well
over three thousand dollars) played
a close-handed game with Gift Fund
solicitors.

The Gift Fund total less than half
the goal set by the YMCA.

But we have a second chance.

Solicitation will be reopened after

‘examinations in an- all-ous drive tp

better our 1960 Christmas showing.

If every Davidson student gives
the price of one pack of cigarettes,
the total will jump to about $2400.

If. in addition, every Davidsonian
sacrifices the price of one hamburger
to the Gift Fund, the total will hop
to just under $3000.

The sacrifice of a beer, a gallon of
gas — well, you get the idea. Some
minor self-denial by Davidson's over-
privileged collegians will mean a ma-
jor benefit for Madras Boys’ Town.
A sacrifice we'll soon forget will mean
a gift those kids ir: India will never
forget.

Surely it’s worth it,

We can afford to double this year’s
Fund, perhaps to triple it.

‘If we remember. If we care. If
we’re willing to chase down a solici-
tor with check in hand. If we're will-
ing to stage — Christmas in January.

The “Radiator” Plan

Davidson’s famous ‘“Ten-Year
Plan,” rapidly nearing the half-way
mark, has proved a spectacular suc-
cess.

The Dana Science Laboratories,
Richardson Dormitory, the Cunning-
ham Music and Fine Arts Center, in-
creased endowment and faculty sal-
aries — all are the result of ambitious
planning and energetic work on the
part of Dr. D. Grier Martin and his
administration.

Significant — and visible — prog-
ress has been made in almost every
phase of the eight-point program
launched in 1957.

But one important project remains
to be tackled.

It’s the call for “a program of dis-
tinguished visiting professors” who
would reside on campus for a semes-
ter or a year, teaching and speaking.
Other excellent schools have spon-

sored such programs with great suc-
cess; notably Amherst where visit-
ing professor Robert Frost once dy.
scribed his job “as being a sort of
poetic radiator.”

The only progress we've see
toward such a program at Davidsop
is a somewhat cautious statement re-
cently in an administration report:
“A system of visiting distinguished
professors — leaders in all fields of
liberal arts education — could serve.
as a stimulus to the kind of scholar-
ship and intellectual growth which
makes a campus attractive to out-
standing class room teachers.”

Could? In our opinion, there’s no
doubt about it.

The Reynolds Lectures are an ex-
cellent innovation. But three days of
Archibold MacLeish are not enough.

We need some intellectual “radia-
tors” — and the sooner, the better.

ESD

The ROTC’s Harsh Proposal

The ROTC department is consider-
ing a change in its drill attendance re-
quirements as follows: any cadet who
cuts drill will have five points sub-
tracted from his final semester grade
unless he is on a college sponsored
trip or has a medical excuse from
classes for the entire day.

The proposed change has been
made because many cadets are taking
most of their ROTC cuts at drill in-
stead of in the classroom.

We agree with the ROTC depart.
ment that it is necessary to have men
present if one is going to conduct
“leadership laboratory.” But the pro-
posed change will enact too severe a
punishment on anyone who cuts drill.

The department is overestimating
the value of drill if it feels a cadet
cannot miss it one time during a se-

mester. We think the average David-
son student is proficient enough to
overcome an absence from the repeti-
tion of the manual of arms and pa-
rade practice. .

Since the main problem is the ab-
sence at drill of MS I and MS Il ca-
dets, we suggest that the ROTC de-
partment limit the underclassmen ca-
dets to five cuts instead of the pres-
ent eight. Since these students us-
ually take at least two class cuts a
semester, they could then take only
one drill cut and the existing problem
would be remedied. :

Enough hostility now exists in the
Student body against ROTC require-
ments without aggravating the situ-
ation by adopting this unnecessarily
harsh proposal.

Discretion Still Needed
In Drinking, Trask Says

By GEORGE TRASK

(Editor's Note: George.
Trask is First Vice-Presi-
dent of the student body.
He has devoted a great
deal of attention to the

student regulations as a
member of the Council
committee on the student
‘body constitution.)

After many years of ration-
alization and hypocrisy the
student body has finally giv-
en up alt attempts to enforce
the “under the influence”
clause of the Student Body
Constitution.

Until the recent amend-

ment every student was
bound by duty and every
member of the Student Coun-
cil and the Honor Court was
bound by honor oath to re-
port violations of this clause.
It has now been repealed,
leaving a situation and im-
plications of which I believe
most students are unaware.

In the first place I must
emphasize that the amend-
ment affects only student-
body regulations, that is, the
set of rules self-imposed and
self-enforced by the students
themselves through their
constitution.

FACULTY

The faculty has in no way
changed its position toward
drinking, meaning that the
ages-old faculty rule against

returning to school ‘under -

the influence” still remains
in effect.

Actually, then, all students
have done is to inform the
faculty that from now on
they are not going to turn
over to the Honor Court a
fellow student if he returns
to school tipsy from down-
ing one too many at Hattie’s.

This situation has existed
for as long as 1 have been at
Davidson and probably for
many years before my arriv-
al. Everyone knows that the
chances of being caught “un-
der the influence” are very
slim, primarily because no-
body, no student at least, is

going to report him. The

amendment merely makes

the student attitude official.
ENFORCEMENT

Difficulty of enforcement
is the main reason for re-
moval of the “under the in-
fluence” clause, I believe. In
a student body where drink-
ing is practiced by well over
50 per cent of the members
and condoned by almost all
the rest, the Student Coun-
cil agreed unanimously that
even they themselves were
unwilling to uphold a rule
which prohibited a student
from returning to his room
after drnking alcoholic bev-
erages.

In fact, it was the Student
Council who initiated the
proposal resulting in striking
out the “under the inf'u-
ence” clause.

Moreover, by admitting
their own lack of support for
the clause, the Student Coun-
cil felt that they were com-
promising their honor pledge
to uphold student-body reg-
ulations, thereby weakening
the entire honor system.

The vagueness of the
phrase “under the influence”
has made this consideration
important. It has allowed so
much freedom of interpreta-
ti.n that no Student Council
o° Honor Court member
within the past three years
+s r-purted a violation of
1 + clause.

RUNNING AINAY

In fact they have actually
been running away from sus-
pected offenders, soothing
their consciences with such
ralionalizations as ‘well, I
really didn’t see him,” or “he
may ‘just have a fever or the
the”

I have no doubts whatso-
ever tnat the Student Coun-
cil, Honor Court, and most
other members of the stu-
dent body aim to keep David-
son an alcohol-free campus.

Left as a student regula-
tion is the potent rule impos-
ing a penalty of dismissal
from college against any

LETTERS TO THE EDITORS

Byrd Labels Alma Mater
A Dated “Funeral March”

Dear Editor:

There is one noticeable
Jack on our campus that it
seems could be remedied
easily enough with a little
desire from the right peo-
ple. The absence of an alma
mater is what I am speaking
of.

Oh, | know that some-
where in our archives
there is a song thet is
called the Davidson aima
mater, but what good is it
it it is never heard?

I daresay that 75 per cent
of our student body does not
know the first verse of that
little ditty, or is even sure
of the tune. I think it is rath-

er pathetic that at athletic
games and other school gath-

erings the Davidson alma
mater is never sung.

My suggestion ts this:
discard the old-fashioned
and outdated song we have
now and have a new one
written. We need some-

thing with original words,
and above all, with a tune
thet is catchy enough to

student “guilty of drinking
alcoholic liquors or having
the same in his possession on
the campus.”

It works: several students
have been dismissed in re-
cent years under its provisi-
ons.

MORE COPS

I further have no doubts
that the faculty, if it so de-
sired, could enforce vigor-
ously its rule prohibiting a
student from “. . . being un-
der the influence of an. al-
coholic beverage while with-
in the town limits of Da-
vidson .. . " simply by hir-
ing a half-dozen more Cop
Linker’s and kicking out any
student who puts his foot on
the campus with alcohol on
his breath.

This solution seems hardly
likely however as the size of
the student body would un-
doubtediy dwindle until only
a nucleus of feetotalers re-
mained. 4

Far more likely neverthe-
less is the possibility that
the faculty will attempt some
sort of tightening of controls
over the student's off-cam-
pus drinking habits.

Lack of student support
and enforcement will be a
definite handicap to effec-
tive control, however.

Without offering any ar-
guments either for or against
the practice of drinking, I
do believe that it is becom-
ing every year a more near-
ly universally accepted so-
cial custom. In approaching
the drinking problem the fac-
ulty is going to have to take
that consideration into ac-
count.

On the other hand the stu-
dent body has no reason to
rejoice over any newly-cre-
ated anti-prohibition meas-
ures as a result of their con-
stitutional amendment. Ma-
turity, sound judgment, and
discretion are needed lest
someone suddenly find him-
self on the outside looking
in futilely pleading, “well,
I thought we could drink on
campus now.”

raise o few goose bumps.

I don't believe this student
body is so sophisticated that
it can’t get sentimental once
in’ a while. The funeral
march we have now should
be thrown out in favor of a
song the student body will
want to learn and be proud
to sing.

FOCUS:

Dean Bailey's Father, 90,

Tolerates No Nonsense

By ERVIN DUGGAN

Dean John Bailey’s ninety-year old father — vis-
iting now in Davidson — is a white-haired, white-
mustached version ‘of his son a bit smaller, perhaps
— with the same alert eyes behind rimless spectacles.

He has a booming voice, a big laugh, @ sharp,
energetic manner. ;

He's a natty dresser, he wears a dark suit, always
—with vest.

A retired minister from Summerton, S. C., the
Reverend J. C. Bailey’s penchant for no-nonsense
preaching has bécome legendary.

(Once called upon to pray, he rose with char-
acteristic aplomb, snapped, “Lord, give us strength
to fight the devil. Amen.” — and sat down.)

When he reached his late eighties, his prodigious
energy became a problem: his sons made him stop
driving a car.

“They were afraid I'd kill myself or kill some-
body else,” he says, “so now I'm dependent on other
people for my rides.”

We visited him Wednesday.

“Sit down close to me, young man,” he said
when we entered. “I’m deaf in one ear and can‘t
hear with the other.”

We discussed education: the decline of pedagogi-
cal spankings, an early teacher of his (“Why, we all
hated him — because he made us learn.”) Princeton
Seminary ... and Davidson, from which he holds an
honorary degree.

“Davidson. You've got a fine institution, so
take advantage of it. Study! Don’t just walk up and
down the halls. Why, someday you may be Secre-
tary of State!”

“Now, don’t nut me on the spot about how much
1 studied.” He laughed again. “I didn’t make A’s!”

The conversation moved to current events—: the
race issue, politics, John F. Kennedy:

“Well, I’m no politician. My allegiance is to the
governor of South Carolina and then to the president
of the United States.

‘1 don’t believe in asking religious questions to
any candidate. Of course, a strict Roman Catholic has
a civil as well as a religious allegiance to Rome.

“But | don’t think that'll cause Kennedy any
trouble. He doesn’t seem to be too hot about his
church, from what I’ve seen.”

He handed down opinions in a rapid-fire volley,
lacing his talk with anecdotes, gestures, frequent
laughter.

On religion— “Religion never moves in a
straight line. It has up and downs, low points and
then revivals. We've got more people in the churches
now than ever before in its history — but that does-
n‘t mean everybody going to church is converted.”

On Oral Roberts: “That man is a mystery to me.
Of course I believe in faith healing — I’ve seen peo-

le recover that the doctors gave up for lost — but
his thing of coming up and breaking your crutches
is beyond me. I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody.
But it’s-none of my business.”

On morals: “I’m a teetotaler as far as whiskey is -
concerned. I’ve seen people bound hand and foo’ by
liquor. A terrible thing. People nowadays are serving
it in their homes. I hope you didn’t know that but
it’s the truth.”

On North Carolina: ‘Far inferior to South Caro-
lina, but the longer I stay, the better I like it.”

The afternoon passed too quickly. Soon we were
shaking hands .. . .

At the door came his last comment. “I’ve certain-
ly enjoyed talking to you, young man” — there was
a gleam in his eye — “But please don’t quote anything
| Said!”

h And the Reverend Dr. Bailey strode back into the
ouse.

NOSMO KING REPORTS...

Students Use Heads
As Exams Approach

Frantic student activity in preparation for exams
has rendered another Nosmo King Report inevitable.
The pollster has risked life, limb, and two reviews to
bring the campus up to date on dramatic occurrences
around the D. .

ee 8 #

...Atense development has crippled the campus
as dormitory provisions for more urgent activity have
been usurped by an increasing number of students
who are using them for study carrels. Many a student
is on the edge of his seat as bad feelings mount, espe-
cially in the freshman dorms and in Duke, where fa-
cilities are limited. One solution to the problem seems
to be the use of “Study Carrel” labels on out-of-order
units, to provide for better supply economy and for
maximum use of materiel.

... The situation threatens to turn the student body
into a tribe of head hunters.
.. . I predict stringent Student Council legislation in
the near future to protect the student body from fric-
tion between hunters and hoarders.

... This may also call for a revival of “Better Heads
for a Better Davidson” a movement from near the
heart of the student body last year. Members of the
Board of Visitors might be encouraged to bequeath
large sume to provide memorial heads such as the
Woodrow Wilson Memorial Head which has been a

ermanent fixture on 4th floor East since 1912. A new
innovation will, of course, be fake facilities for study-

ing. ees

... ] predict a rumor of mono at Salem will stimulate
a mass exodus from the campus this weekend as
Davidson men make a last ditch effort to avoid exams.
Hoof-and-mouth is reportedly available at another
nearby campus. Incidentally, indigestion has been par-
ticularly successful at the Infirmary during the last
week.
