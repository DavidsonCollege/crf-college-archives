GREENSBORO HIGH ELEVEN
GETTING READY FOR SEASON

McFadden to be Head Coach, Losing
Six Old Men—Greensboro, Gas-
tonia, Winston, Lincolnton and
Charlotte Squads to be Trained by
Davidson College Men.

Greensboro, Aug. 12—J. M. (Rooster)
McFadden, Davidson College football
star, will coach the Greensboro High
Seuo0! football squad. this- fall... The
local squad will start regular workouts
on August 17th. The 1922 squad will be
minus six letter men of the 1921 aggrega-
tion but Greensboro fans are sure that
Coach McFadden will be able to build
up a fast eleven, although somewhat
lighter than usual high school grid en-
tries of Western Carolina.

Rivalry among the Western high
schools during the coming pigskin sea-
son will be unusually strong. No less
than a half a dozen Davidson College
graduates, several of the class of I921

will have charges on the gridiron this

season and most of them will be pitched
against one another. McFadden, men-

|ed with the

tioned above, will run the Greensboro

High machine. “Doc” LaFar, smashing
guard who was McFadden’s captain last
year will be head coach of the Winston-
Salem High School entry. Bethea, back-
field man on Davidson’s squad will coach
the, Lincolnton squad. Lowry, also of
Davidson, will assist in training the Gas-
tonia Highs machine. Simmons, once a
Davidson head coach, may coach the
Charlotte preps., as the Queen City fans
are hot in after Mr. Simomns for their
coach and it is likely that he will give
in to them. So with five or more prep.
school machines moving against similar
coached elevens, all of which may use
the same principals, it will be a hot old
time for some body in November and
October and fans are sure to get their
‘money’s worth when they attend such
games.

- Greensboro’s training for the coming
season will be started at Camp Hicone
on August 17th.

The gridiron aspirants will report on
the morning of that day for a 10-day
period during which particular attention
will be given to drilling them in the
rudiments of the game and getting them
in physical condition for actual work on

\ the field.

Coach McFadden will arrive August
16th, ready for the opening of training.

He will be assisted at the camp by Wil-

liam York and C.. W. Phillips, both ex-
perienced football men.

THE “Y” BELONGS TO YOU;
USE IT

Now that vacation days are coming to
a close we think of returning to school
and meeting all of our friends whom
we left last June and also the new men.
We trust each of you have had a pleas-
ant summer and that you will come on
the opening day with renewed energy.
Davidson seems to be better equipped
now than ever before, and we know that
we are going to have a wonderful year.

The Y. M.C. A. is planning a banner year
and we wish to get started right at the
beginning of school and. serve you
throughout the year to the best of our
ability. The “Y” belongs to you and we
want you to use it. :

The Blue Ridge Conference was a suc-
cess in- every way and we are proud of
our splendid delegation that represented
us there.

We hope that you wil arrive with a
determination to get everything possible
out of college this year. Let’s all pull

together as we have heretofore and co-

operate with all the organizations on
the Hill and by so doing we will be as-
sured of a happy hard-working student
body.

You who are coming for the first time,
we want you to feel that the “Y” is your
big brother. Come with a desire to de-
velop spiritually, mentally and physical-
ly. Now, we old men want to be here
at the opening of school so that we may
help the Freshmen to become acquaint-
surroundings, and _ start
them off with the true Davidson spirit.
