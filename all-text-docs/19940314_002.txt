Students
elected for
campus
councils

By Katherine Hash

The faces of many campus
organizations are changing as new
officers and members are elected
to fill positions on numerous com-
mittees and councils. Elections for
positions on the Council on Cam-
pus and Religious Life (CCRL),
the Honor Council, Reach Out, the
Review Board, and the Student
Conduct Council (SCC) were held
last week. ioe

Junior Andrew Smitherman
and Sophomore Ashley Tabb'were
elected to serve on the Council on
Campus and Religious Life. CCRL
is an advisory board which meets
at least twice a semester to make
decisions on campus life issues—
i.e. the alcohol policy, Patterson
Court,

Junior Alison Woodward was
elected to represent the Junior class
on the Honor Council after three
run-offs.

Reach Out’s newly elected
president, junior Elizabeth
Fleming, and vice-president,
sophomore Smita Donthamsetty,
will be heading the efforts of the
umbrella organization which co-
ordinates 18 campus and commu-
nity service programs and provides
service information and opportu-
nities for students. Fleming has
plans to “create a service network
between Reach Out, Patterson
Court houses, and other campus
groups.”

Senior Scott Newnam and Jun-
ior Josh Neubauer were elected to
the Student Conduct Council. The
SCC is an advisory council to the
president which deals with matters
related to student conduct and dis-
ciplinary actions, including
changes in the Code of Responsi-
bility, disciplinary code and the
Honor Code. :

Course guide controversy

By Court McBryde

Sophomore Jamie McConnel
and junior BJ Rudell are taking the
initiative on behalf of the Student
Review Board in an effort to pub-
lish Davidson’s first course guide.

However, their quest has
raised controversy and questions
among Davidson faculty, admin-
istrators, and students.

What is the course guide?

The course guide would be
distributed to students at the be-
ginning of the academic year. The
incoming freshman class would
receive books by mail, before they
register for classes.

The book would be acompila-
tion of data received from student
responses to the course evaluation
questionnaires. The course guide
would provide information on
courses offered for the fall semes-
ter and the professors teaching
those classes. McConnel and
Rudell then hope to continue the
publication for the next year.

How much would it cost?

McConnel’s initial estimated
publishing fee for this book was
$12,000. He went before the Ac-
tivities Tax Council (ATC), which
delegates funds for student organi-
zations.

The ATC gave McConnel
$200, which was then approved by
the SGA, to reimburse him for the
multiple copies of questionnaires.
However, no other funds were al-
located.

ATC chair Jason Bertsch says

“that although the council did not

grant McConnel the money he re-
quested, “it seemed like the ATC
generally supported the idea.”

Bertsch says that McConnel
will wait for the number of re-
sponses to the questionnaires and,
depending upon the feedback he
receives, will apply again for the
money.

In April the ATC will revise
the budget for the 1994-1995
school year. Bertsch says the ATC
will not be able to completely cover
the high price of publication. Fund-
ing for the book will have to come

from other organizations on cam-
pus.
What is McConnel’s
position?

McConnel started the quest
for the course guide; Rudell joined
him after hearing his initial pro-
posal to the Student Government
Association. McConnel says that
as of last week, 489 responses to
the questionnaire had been col-
lected, and by “the end of the week-
end we will have over 500.”

Rudell says a lot of people see
the course guide as “causing a rift
between professors and students,
but neither Jamie nor I see it that
way.” Rudell says there are some
courses that may not be as strong
as others and incoming freshmen
need to know about the difficulty
and pace of other classes.

McConnel learned from Dean
of Faculty Robert Williams that
tenure faculty only look at their
own course evaluations once ev-
ery six years. Rudell says, “This
book is not for faculty. It is not
,intended to harm anyone.”

One concern McConnel ex-

presses is that “a lot of people have
nottaken the evaluations seriously.
It is important for students to un-
derstand if we only get 600 re-
sponses, then [the guide] won’t
measure what classes are really
like. The effort must come from
both sides,” McConnel says. “We
need more responses to make this
work.”
Where do the concerns and
controversy lie?

McConnel had to present his
proposal to the Media Board. Dean
of Students Will Terry is amember
of the committee and says the board
understands McConnel’s motiva-
tions and thinks his aims are good,
but the board is concerned with
several issues.

Dean Terry says the price is
extremely high, and “we think their
kind of survey is really tricky. We
feel some anxiety about the Media
Board’s responsibility.”

“We are not in the business of
censorship,” Dean Terry says, “but
with a mass amount of critical data
and heavy weight of negative com-
ments, they didn’t have enough

response to give a fair response.”

“Personally, this issue con-
cerns me. If it is not done very
scientifically and with enormous
care, it could undermine the aca-
demic integrity of this college,”
Dean Terry says.

SGA Vice President Allison
Sabel says there are several pros
and cons to the proposed guide. “It
would allow students to learn about
courses and professors from other
students’s experiences.” However,
Sabel worries that if a student re-
ceives a bad grade from a profes-
sor, his or her response cannot be
considered completely valid or
objective.

SGA President Eric
Rosenbach says he commends
McConnel for his initiative, but
the questionnaires are based on
“numbers, not comments,” and the
professors’ situations needs to be
taken into consideration. “It’s a
good start for something that could
happen in the future,” Rosenbach
says.

Kaylor publishes nationwide Bible
study guide for Presbyterian women

By Ashlyn Dannelly

This year, more than 200,000
Presbyterians nationwide will read
a book written by Davidson reli-
gion professor and department
chair David Kaylor. °

Dr. Kaylor wrote the 1994
Horizons Bible Study for Presby-
terian Women, entitled Who is the
Christ?

According to Kaylor, the book
includes “passages of scripture,
interpretation, and commentary for
study in monthly meetings.”
Nearly 250,000 copies of the 90-
page book have been printed in
English, Spanish, Korean, and
Braille.

Kaylor says the book is aimed

Take Back the Night marches March 29

By Kristin Garris

The fourth annual Take Back
the Night program and march will
take place Tuesday, March 29, at 7
p.m. in the 900 Room.

In April 1991, the first annual
‘Take Back the Night at Davidson
was scheduled as part of the
Union’s Solidarity Week. Now it
is organized and sponsored by the
Committee for Women’s Issues

and is held during March — Na-
tional Women’s History Month.

Speakers during the event re-
late how their experiences of sexual
assault have affected their lives,
including relationships with oth-
ers and their own self-perception.
After the program, a procession
will weave its way through the
darkest parts of the Davidson cam-
pus.

The event is designed not only
to promote awareness of sexual
assault and to educate the Davidson
community. But also to empower
the speakers and other survivors of
sexual assault. In sharing their
experiences, survivors help others
realize they are not alone in their
pain. Statistics show that one in
every four college women are vic-
tims of rape or attempted rape.

at Presbyterian
women’s groups,
#} because “histori-
71 cally, the women
have had more or-
ganizations for

er

‘ worship. The
Dr. David men have been
Kaylor less likely to do’

so... however,
they are encouraging men’s groups
to use the material also.”

The guide relates the teach-
ings of Christ to modern issues.
The book's topics are based on
scripture from the epistles.

Kaylor was asked by the Pres-
byterian national organization to
write the book. He was chosen

because one member of the author
selection committee read his book
on Paul’s covenant community.

He will also appear in a video
made by the Presbyterian Church
which serves to “introduce groups
studying the book to the author.”
The ten-minute video includes an
interview with Kaylor and shows
scenes of the professor discussing
religious topics with his Davidson
students. The video also details his
life as a religion professor at
Davidson.

The video will be shown at
local churches and at conferences
where women leading their church
groups in studying Kaylor’s book
will view it as part of their training.
