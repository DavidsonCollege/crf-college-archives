Is Scholarship Keeping Creativity Down?

Creativity and Learning should
be intimate lovers. Correct me if I
am wrong, but at Davidson College
they seem to get along as well as an
abusive couple. Scholarship, ‘round
these parts the nickname of Learn-
ing and the husband of Creativity,
often keeps down Creativity, the
youngest in a large family who used
to use her gifts to escape and-attract
attention. I say “used to” because
Creativity has become inclusively
individual and can no longer attract
enough attention to make her so-
cial, at least in the classroom.

So what would happen if this
couple were to seek education coun-
selling? The counsellor, most likely
schooled -in the. Sensitivities, all
those schools: of thought that par-
ticularize for posterity, would ap-
peal to Scholarship’s side. The
counsellor may nod to Creativity’s
side with a comment such as, “Per-
haps your thoughts should be just
that, cultivate them and maybe in
time they will cross paths with your
(in)significant other’s.” Creativity
would most likely storm out of the

room in disgust crying out in vain to
the taken-hostage Muses of antiq-
uity. Her first marriage with that
conglomeration of foundational arts
and sciences, what some of us would
call high school, was not much dif-

when staggering through one novel,
text book, or theory after the other
without a word of her own. From
time to time, through reviews, pa-
pers, and finals, Scholarship will
actually make a request of her show-

she will not explore. Rather than
learning how to think, she will learn
how to know. These are generaliza-
tions, for not all classes or profes-
sors are like this, but this is what I
have noticed in my own experience

No, that’s not necessarily true, but

In wake of the recent fatal
shooting of Carolyn Sue Boetticher
last Tuesday evening by Charlotte-
Mecklenberg police officers Don
Belz and Shannon Jordan, yet an-
other outcry has gone up against
the police. More people are ques-
tioning what they perceive to be
an increase in excessive force by
the police. December 29, 1993,
Wendy Thompson was shot and
killed by Officer Mark Farmer,
and on November 19, 1996, Of-
ficer Michael Marlow fatally shot
James Willie Cooper. None of the
three, Boetticher, Thompson, or
Cooper, were armed; all three were

that is what they are expected to do.
But no matter how well one may
have done in the past, one error or
misjudgment effectively erases any
good record. Errors by the police
department are much more conse-
quential than a ball being called a
strike, but they are still human.
Police officers have an incred-
ibly difficult and stressful job. They
must make split-second decisions
in life-or-death matters. They have
to be suspicious of every car they
pull over because they never know
who awaits them behind the wheel.
Police officers would not be the
most loved people regardless of re-

did earlier this year?

Before jumping to conclu-
sions, one has to look at the cir-
cumstances in which the fatal
shootings took place. When Th-
ompson was pulled over, she had a
blood alcohol level of 0.25 per-

cent, three times the legal amount. |-

Maybe these incidents are le-
gitimate reasons to become suspi-
cious of the men in blue — good-
ness knows they were all night-
mares. But they are only a few
isolated events. I have not studied
the police very much, but I believe
that the overall reputation of po-
lice officers has been tarnished
due to the high publicity that is
given to all suspicious encounters
between the police and the citi-
zens they are sworn to protect.
Police officers are much like
umpires in baseball or referees in
any sporting event because they
have a relatively thankless job.

when do you usually interact with
them? Unless you are related to one
or live next door to one, you prob-
ably speak to them after you get
caughttrying to drive home inrecord
time or after you’ ve suffered a trau-
matic experience, such as a bur-
glary or mugging. Thus, they are
often associated with negative ex-
periences, and this does not do won-
ders for their image. They are not
looked upon like heroes as firemen
are.

How many Davidson students
would ever want to be a police of-
ficer? How many would be willing
to try to apprehend bank robbers
with automatic weapons blazing as
the Los Angeles Police Department

ficers felt their
lives and/or the lives of others to be
in danger, and they reacted. The
results of their actions were ter-
rible and have caused great pain
for the victims’ families. Those
officers must now live with know-
ing that they killed another human.
No good has come from these inci-
dents for anybody. —

I’m not trying to take sides. I
was not there. I do not.know ex-
actly what happened or what was
going through the minds of the
officers or the victims at the time.
Neither am I saying that all police.
officers are saints, because there
are some bad cops out there. But it
is not fair to characterize all cops
as bad because of the actions of a
few.

a class in which diagnostic testing
is anessential, in-class essays should
get the axe in humanities courses.
Instead, why not a weekly or bi-
monthly twotothree page “thought”
paper that would concentrate on
any point taken from class or read-
ing that particularly struck the bright
young student’s mind? Because of
such assignments, I can honestly
say that I feel that I learned consid-
erably more last year at the Univer-
sity of Vermont than this year at a
deceptively 11th-ranked Davidson
College. After graduation, when
you’ re toasting it up, Davidson will
