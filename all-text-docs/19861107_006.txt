Friday, November 7, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Hope lies eternally dormant in
the human heart, said a keen ob-
server from another part of the
world, But the sheer intesnsity of
the haiku master’s optimism takes
one’s breath away. One almost
welcomes adversity:

“Since my house

Burned down, I now own

a better view of the ae
moon.’

— Masahide

The poet’s sight does not only
settle on nature to discover her
garce and sublimity; he also ob-
serves teh darker side. Even a

man-made apparition can be the

subject from which to draw a les-
son:
“The people, we know. . .
But these days, even scarec-
rows

Do not stand upright.”
~ — Issa

Is the poet capable of discern-
ing only the grim, the sober and
the’ solemn? Here again, we are
surprised:

“Oh moon, why must you in-
spire ry

My neighbor to chirp

All night on a flute.”

-.— Koyo :

Yet, it is in the solemn that the
haiku masters. really excel. Some
of ,the finest lines on death are
worth quoting:

“The leaves never know

Which leaf will be the first to
fall .

Dees the wind know.”

— Soseki

As in all literary forms, the
translation can ‘never retain the
flavor of the original. In the
Japanese version, the haiku is full
of literary quotations, allusions
and double meanings which
would not only be virtually impos-
sible to translate but could not be

understood even if a proper trans-
lation were made available.
