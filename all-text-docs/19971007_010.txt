THE DAVIDSONIAN

Op-Ep

Urban Plunge a suspect

or anyone interested, we are plan
Re a new alternative for those
who have no home to goto this fall.

It’s called the Prep Plunge. We're
inviting the grungiest street kids to our
own utopian Davidson Campus. They're
responsible for finding their own way
here. But once on campus, we'll hand
them an American Express card and keys
to a shiny new Honda Accord.

They’ ll be paired with one of many
Davidson students who volunteer to act as
their guide. This guide will promptly
escort them to South Park and help them
pick out the general attire of a Davidson
College student, so they'll “blend.”

No department stores for our home-
less pals, only the best from Gap, Banana
Republic, and J. Crew. Equipped with
their new ensembles, they’ ll be expected
to participate in all the rigorous aspects of
Davidson life, including classes, bar time,
and even the Court. (Don’t fear for their
safety — they'll be paired with people
who will point them in the direction of a
good hook-up.) oe

These transformed homeless teens
are sure to assimilate perfectly in their
new environment. Then we’ll send them
back with a lot-more compassion and
empathy for the people in business suits
shooting them dirty looks.

If you think this is a pointless and
perhaps degrading program, maybe you'll
take a new look at the Urban Plunge.
Preparation for the Urban Plunge first
involves pairing a female with a male
partner who will hopefully provide pro-
tection from rapists or any other attackers.

The group will then take a trip to the
thrift store to buy clothes trashy enough to
blend with the homeless. On Tuesday or
Wednesday, our pioneers will cease to
shower and shave to attain in a matter of
days the scruffy appearance that comes
from successive days and nights spent on

the streets. Never mind that cute hair cut
and healthy glow. When the clock strikes
midnight, our Davidson Cinderellas will
be magically transformed to a desperate
group of homeless young adults.

On Friday, they will then board a
van — maybe even the Vamanos Van —
for their almost free ride to Washington,
D.C. Once they arrive, each male-female
pair will meet their personal homeless
contact. Now they’re ready to spend the

next two days living the life of the home-
less.

Although this program has endured
for many years, obvious safety risks have
never been resolved. Not to degrade the
male members of this trip, but how can
they be expected to provide protection for
the pair? It seems very unlikely that a
person could rationalize with a psychotic
individual or defend themselves from an
armed or physically superior person.

The danger is enhanced by the fact

that the students are discouraged from .

carrying weapons, which directors say
could actually increase danger.

Furthermore, these students will be
hindered by a lack of sleep, proper nutri-
tion, and a fear they probably have never
experienced. 1

With this huge risk to the safety of
the participants, we would hope to find a
valid point behind the Urban Plunge.
Unfortunately, though, we do not.

This program cannot provide the true
experience of a homeless person when the
students know their comfortable, stable

home awaits their return.

They will not learn anything we do
not already know. You don’t have to
sleep ona sidewalk to know that it is hard.

You don’t have to skip showers to know .

you'll smell. You can watch the news and
know the dangers of the streets.

Not only are these students failing to
authentically experience homeless life,
but they also fail to help the homeless
people in any way. They may even harm
them in the process. The students must
beg alms to support themselves. These
alms would otherwise go to those truly in
need.

Taking from those less fortunate and
deceiving anyone violates the integrity
Davidson College claims to uphold.
Would the time, effort, and money put
into this program not be better ‘spent ac-
tively helping homeless people?

This game of make-believe is a bla-
tant show of disrespect to those who actu-
ally live on the streets. The Urban Plunge
has reduced the experience of
homelessness to roughing it for a couple
of days.

Our students merely experience the
comparatively easy aspects of street life.
While many homeless teens desperately
support themselves through prostitution
and drug sales, Davidson students will not
be forced to resort to such dire méans of

‘survival.

We don’t wish to offend those in-
volved in this program. It is probably an
experience they will never forget. How-
ever, the benefits of the Urban Plunge do
not outweigh the risks. Our own experi-
ences working in shelters and soup kitch-
ens enabled us to safely understand the
desperation of the homeless while at the
same time directly helping them.

Just remember, when all the Plung-
ing is done, we’ re still at Davidson and the
homeless are still on the streets. '

umans tend to be self-righ
teous about whatever they do.
Self-righteous thoughts,

words, and actions create the majority
of problems which exist within the
College community. I wish to bring up
the terms “open-minded” and “closed-
minded” because
I have a personal
problem with la-

Self-righteousness at Davidson?

one should be getting drunk because
they value themselves on how many
drinks they can down.

There are those people who are
proud to go to a school with a national
reputation who think that everyone
should be studying more so that
Davidson can
reach No. 1
(what a day that
would be!).

with one-word
definitions.

I have met ;
“closed-minded” people who think that
their life choices should be everyone's
life choices. Ihave met “open-minded”
people who are not “open-minded” to
“closed-mindedness.” Is there any dif-
ference between the two people?

We all have sat in classrooms
where certain professors project their
egotistical beliefs onto us — that their
class is the most important and that
their field is the Truth because they
have a certain knowledge of their field
of study. They point to themselves
instead of what they are supposedly
teaching.

Are they preaching academic doc-
trine for us to swallow or are they
pointing to the sources of knowledge
which truly aid in our overall educa-
tion? Does anyone else feel cheated in
their “education?”

We experience religious tension
on campus. There are those who wear
their “belief banners” so that dll may
know The Truth. There are also those
who wear banners professing their elit-
ism of non-faith. Is their any differ-
ence in self-righteous behavior between
the two people?

We see self-absorption daily in
ourselves and in others around us.
There are those who think that every-

There
are those who
think that every-

one should be “working out” because
their bodies are rock-hard. There are
those people “saving the world”
through “community service” who
think that everyone should commit
themselves fully to campus volunteer
organizations. “Community service”
is more important than listening to a
close friend in need, right?

There are even those who have
already thought through every single
word I have written and will say out
loud, “I had these thoughts before I
even reached puberty!”

Excellent. Let go of your pride
and share your thoughts in next week’s
Davidsonian. Would you rather voice
yourself or sit back and be a boring
(yet paradoxically silent) critic?

To all the self-righteousness, all
the pride, all the contradictions of
people who have their lives “mapped”
out - don’t analyze my writing style.
Look at yourself and evaluate.

Who are you, besides a person
who is quick to judge others? I'll tell
you who you are: you are a beautiful
person who is capable of looking past
yourself and loving others. How can
you love yourself enough to truly love
others?

You know the answer.

ndependents, do you have is

sues that you want addressed

by the SGA? Do you want an
explanation for a certain program
on campus?

Do you just want to vent?
Well, here is your chance.

Your newly elected indepen-
dent senators — Will Ragland,
Molly Allan,
J fo) e
Hayworth,
Lisa
Worthington,
Brent Ferrell, and myself — in
order to best represent your con-
cerns, are starting an Independents
Roundtable in Vail Commons and
would like to personally invite all
of you to attend.

The Roundtable will meet ev-
ery Wednesday from 11:30 a.m.-
1:00 p.m. beginning the week after
fall break.

The Roundtable will aid us,
your representatives, in represent-
ing your concerns to the SGA to
the best of our ability.

First, it will be an excellent
opportunity for you to share a won-
derful Commons meal (ha ha) with
your representatives, and voice
your concerns about Davidson life.

Second, the Roundtable pro-
vides a good forum for us to ex-
plain to you what the SGA has
been working.on and what ideas
we have to improve Davidson life
for independents. __

When I was running for sena-
tor, I was. struck by how many

Independents Roundtable:
A chance to be heard

students were unsure of the role of
Independent senators.

Many were not aware, for ex-
ample, that there are six indepen-
dent senators.

Many also expressed their
doubts about the ability of the SGA
to actually effect change.

This Roundtable is a prime
opportunity
forus to show
you what we
can and are
doing to help
you.

Finally, and most importantly
to me, it allows you to meet us ina
personal and informal setting so
that you will feel free to approach
us at any time with any further
suggestions or comments.

I hope to get to know every
independent at Davidson, and this
will help facilitate that goal.

This Roundtable has a lot of
potential, and we are excited about
it. Yet it will only work as well as
you want it to. To have an open
dialogue requires people who are
willing to bring ideas to the table.

We sincerely hope that every
independent will set aside at least
one lunch period from his or her
busy schedule and join us in an
open and informative discussion.

Even if you just want to stop
by for a few minutes and give us
your ideas, that would help us
greatly.

As Jerry Maguire would say,
“Help us help you!”

Three types of drivers: bad,
‘Tain’tin Texas no more.’

ou know those people who

are always on the road

when you are? Those
people whose driving skills are so
poor that éven an aged ro- |
dent could out perform
them? My dad classifies
these people into two
groups.

First, there’s Bubba
and Dwayne Jr. in the faded
Chevy half-ton with a gun rack on
the back and the “Beef: It’s What’s
For Dinner’ bumper sticker. Bubba
and Dwayne Jr.’s wardrobe
can vary anywhere from

They seemed to feel that since

we were both operating vintage ve-
hicles, we were going to pull over
and have anespresso or something.

when you see them.

Then there’s that in-

credibly long silver Cadillac
that is on the road each Sunday
afternoon with three to four blue-

- haired ladies chatting vigorously

with the lone surviving husband
struggling to drive in a straight line.

This Caddy never exceeds 20,
and there is always the obligatory
seat belt dragging behind making
sparks.

These are the people with
whom we live and drive. These are
the people we cannot stand.

On a recent evening I popped
in. my Best of Rogers and
Hammerstein CD and began a jaunt
into Charlotte to visit my sister.

This little journey is one of my
favorites, but the time I spend on the
highway perpetuates the disdain I

feel for my fellow motorists.

Idon’t know whatthey were insinu-
ating with those hand gestures —
maybe they just admired the NRA
sticker.

I am officially logged into the
computers at the Raleigh DMV asa
North Carolina resident, but my
Texas upbringing — and more im-
portantly my Texas driving skills
— are still firmly intact.

_ Maybe it is the fact that the
other travelers on Interstate-77 are
unimpressed with my vintage auto-

- mobile, or maybe they don’t like

the way I dance in my car.

Maybe they are not used to my.
tendency to test the boundaries of
the speed limits. Whatever their
issue with me may be, these are not
especially friendly people.

I am highly disenchanted with
this whole “Hi, /’m the lady in the
massive green Buick next to you ,
and not only are my sunglasses big
enough to serve tea on, I’m
going to cut you off now”
scenario.

Get the word out, people:
the blinker is not there for
mere decoration.
It’s OK to go five miles
over the limit and even more_ac-
ceptable not to stop and stare at an
unfortunate motorist who has pulled
over to deal witha faulty trans-
mission.

I'd like to see one or two
sport utility vehicles along-
side those mini-vans with the
wood paneling every once ina
while.

One more thing, that light isn’t
going to get any greener, even if
you water it, so get moving! That
bad boy is green and I’m ina hurry!

I’ma woman who likes to work
a highway, and these prissy drivers
are getting in my way and on my
nerves.

I would like to encourage ev-
eryone to take time out of their busy
study schedule and take a joy ride
on I-77.

Let’s set the standard, people.
Keep your eyes on the road and
your foot on the pedal, I’m not
knocking North Carolina or its resi-
dents, only their driving. Well, OK,
that and this vinegar-based barbe-
cue-sauce,. but we’ll go into that
later.
