The Davidson sailing team»

unexpectedly will host one set of
the South . Atlantic  In-
tercollegiate Sailing
Association (SAISA)
eliminations. this Saturday,
April 12.

The regatta results will deter-
teams
which will compete in the cham-
pionships of the SAISA, the con-
ference to which the Davidson
sailing team belongs.

The eliminations were to have
been held this past weekend at
the University of Virginia.

Several teams, including
Davidson, attempted to sail in
very strong winds at Virginia on
both April 5 and 6. However,
three of Virginia’s six boats
were dismasted by the powerful
gusts, so that only three boats
remained to accomodate the
teams from five schools.

Consequently the
eliminations were postponed
until this weekend. The David-
son team volunteered to host

The Davidson College Golf
Team placed ‘‘somewhere near
the middle’ in the North
Carolina Collegiate golf tour-
nament played Mon. and Tues.
at the Pawtuckett Country
Club, according to coach Tom
Scott.

The tournament, the third
this spring for the Davidson
Golfers, was won by Tom Bar-
nes of Atlantic Christian with a
two day total of 149.

The team title was taken by
the University of North
Carolina with a two-day total of
610 while UNC-Charlotte was
second with 614.

The Collegiate was the third
tournament this spring for the
Davidson golfers. In their two
previous outings, the Red Fox
Tournament played in Charlot-
te and the Furman Invitational ;
the Cats finished 15th out of 15
teams and 24th out of 25 teams,
respectively.

Both tournaments were won
by the University of East Ten-
nessee, one of the top teams in

On Monday, Senior Bob Reni

had the low round for Davidson
shooting a 77. Senior Richard

Anderson was. low man on
Tuesday with a 79. Randy Hun-
ter (75), Bill Coleman (76),
Craig Culbertson (77) and Mike
Lanio (78) are the other: mem-
bers of the team.

Thus far, the team has come
up against some extremely
tough competition. -‘‘All the
teams we’ve faced thus far
have been tougher than us,”
Scott said.

He cited the loss of two of last
year’s top six, Grant Whitney
who transferred to Wake Forest
and -Jerry Horne who trans-
ferred to the University of Geor-
gia, as one reason for theteam’s
lack of success thus far.

“This year, we have an
altogether new club,’”’ said
Scott.

In addition, Scott stated that
not having scholarships to offer,
coupled with not having a
course nearby hurts the team
considerably.

The team practices at the
Country Club of Charlotte which
is a 40 mile round trip for an af-
ternoon’s practice.

“Not only is this a great
distance to travel, said Scott.
“But, in terms of time, it’s a
great demand to maké on any of
the boys.’’

The team is usually able to
practice twice a week.

For the present, Scott hopes
to. give the team “‘lots of tour-
nament exposure. We’ve had
much tough competition thus
far; this is invaluable ex-
perience.”

The, team meets. defending
Southern Conference champion
Appalachian in Charlotte-next
Tuesday, and will play in the
Southern Conference Tour-
nament April 21-23 at the Coun-
try Club of South Carolina.

Scott hopes that added tour-
nament exposure and practice
will have the team ready. “I’m
looking to a 4th or 5th place
finish.” said Scott.
