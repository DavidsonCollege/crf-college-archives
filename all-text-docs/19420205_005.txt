Mr. J. Paine
Interviewed

Former Davidson Student
Makes Address

The DaVidsonian assignment card

published every week by ye assign-

ment editor, Slyme Lyman, this
week really messed us up. Went
down Friday to get the sad news
at the usual time, and there was

nothing there; went down Saturday
to double check, and still nothing
there. Thinking for once we were
numbered among the lucky few, we
set off on a week-end

ot good

cheer with a light heart. But the
vods willed otherwise; on checking
the P. O. drill

I. M., we found the following mes-

by after Monday

sage: “Check by the alumni office
and get an interview with Mr.
Paine. Must be in by 6 ‘P. M.”

Looking at the postoffice clock, we
found the time to be exactly 4:15.
One hour and forty-five minutes to

bring home the bacon in. Bursting

into Mr. Paine’s office, I had already [>

wasn't the only one present. Greatly
flustered, I began apologies, at the
same time edging for the door.
“What can I do for yeu?” came
Mr; “Mir,

will be through in a minute.”

Paine’s cheerful voice.

“Thank you, sir,” 1 replied. I'll
just run down the hall a minute,
and come. back.”

Again [I became vaguely

aware of the presence of a third
party. Now it was someone else.
1 had waited too long For the
first time, I became conscious of

the importance of the job this man
was holding. This time, I sat down
respectfully to wait.

In ‘a few minutes, the visitor left,
and Mr. Paine turned to me, pleas-

antly with a “What's this about an
interview?”

“If you don’t mind, sir.’ This
from me, timidly.

“Well, shoot.”

“First, your birth and education.”

be of interest to know that this is

ing the war even-before the national

capital. As for my education, I went

to Davidson, graduating in 1916.” |

“Do you have any hobbies, sir,”
I asked

“Yes, fishing.”

A brilliant idea struck me

“Do you have any good - fish
stories that you like to tell?” T
asked, chuckling.

Quick as a flash, he came back.

“No, I can't compete with Dr. Me-
Connell.””. We hurriedly moved to
other grounds.

Introduction
Dr. Love was introduced by Dr.
Cunningham, and, many references
were made to the friendship of the
two men when they worked togeth-
er at Louisville Presbyterian Semi-
nary. Dr. Cunningham introduced
Dr. Léve to the students of David-
son as a splendid student of the
Bible
Dr. Love spoke first of the Te-
lationships between Davidson Col-
lege and the Seminary. He referred
to the fact that Dr. Cunningham
vas president of the Seminary for
a number of years and told of the
faculty members and students who
had formerly attended Davidson.
The text which was chosen as the
theme for the evening’s adress was
taken from the last swords of the
twelfth. chapter of’ Corinthians. Dr.
Love suggested that the words
which the apostle Paul spoke to the
people of Corinth should be taken

and an excellent teacher

as a motto for daily living. “A
more excellent way show I unto
thee.”

are constantly seeking better ways
