Clinton promised he would balance the budget and
protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the
environment. He claimed that “Dole’s tax scheme
would blow a hole in the economy.” He responded
to ethical charges by Dole: “I don’t want to
respond in kind for all of these things. I could. I
could answer tb all of these things tit for tat. But I

Dole attacked Clinton about “ethical problems in
the White House today” and said that people .
have lost faith in government because politicians
are not delivering promises. He accused Clinton

_ of having “scandals on a daily basis.”
accused the President of misrepresenting him on
taxes, Medicare and balancing the budget. He
also called for more debates, especially
concerning the economy. Answering a question
about Presidential leadership, Dole said, “I keep
my word. My word is my bond.” About Clinton,
he said, “The President doesn’t have any ideas so
he is out trashing ours.”

Homelessness and affordable housing

By Abe Artis
Guest Writer

Public housing was conceived
by the legislative and executive
branches in the hopes of providing
clean, safe housing for those who
could not otherwise afford it. When
first initiated in 1937, it was very
successful, and many people who
lived in the projects went on to
purchase their own homes. In 1951,
residents of North Carolina’s Rob-
ert S. Jervay Place(a public hous-
ing project) said that their neigh-
borhood was drastically improved
by the new projects. But over the
years, public housing has gone into
a steady and miserable decline.
Jeryay has deteriorated so much
that it is now slated for demolition.
Congress and the President have
both reevaluated the effectiveness
of public housing in its current
incarnation, and have come to dif-
ferent conclusions as to. possible
solutions to the problems faced in
some projects. Most Republicans
believe public housing should
cease being directly provided and
overseen by the government.
Democrats largely favor a plan of
revitalization and correction, while
leaving fundamental responsibil-
ity in the hands of the federal gov-
ernment.

In essence, the GOP proposes
to privatize and dismantle the De-
partment of Housing and Urban
Development(HUD), which over-
sees the public housing projects.
Public housing would in effect
cease to exist, and some of the
budget would be transformed into

individual rent vouchers with
whichimpoverished families could
supposedly find housing on their
own. The rest would be converted
to block grants used for the com-
munity. Proponents of the GOP
vouchers claim these vouchers
would promote independence; a
way out of the “cycle of depen-

dency.”

However, this solution is short
sighted. The Republicans assume
that the private housing industry
could dispense better housing more
efficiently than the government.
But slums and dilapidated housing
exist at least as prevalently in the
private sector as in the public. Ina
1993 survey of all American house-
holds, the U.S. Census Bureau
found that 4.9% had no working
flush toilets some time in the last 3
months, and 7% were uncomfort-
ably cold for 24 hours or more the
winter before the survey. A HUD
special commission found about
6% of public housing to have the
same or worse conditions. Rent
vouchers could easily become sub-
sidies for private sector slumlords.
And if the federal government re-
linquishes any direct supervision,
the ability to make direct change is
nullified. :

In contrast, most Democrats
advocate policies(some of which
have already begun) of public hous-
ing renewal, not elimination. In a
June 1996 report, HUD summa-
rized the major initiatives to be
undertaken.

“ Replacement of the worst
public housing developments with
less dense, economically integrated

for their actions.”
