DAVIDSON DEBATERS
MEET FORA TAN

Debate Question of Conscrip-
tion of Wealth as Well as
Men in War

On Monday night, a debating
team composed of Tony Harlow
and Bob Hewitt, sophomores from
the University of Florida, debated
against John Reisner and Sherrod
Rice, sophomores on the Davidson
debating team, on the question: Re-
solved: That Wealth As Well As
Man-Power Should Be Conscripted
In Time of War.

There was no decision to the de-
bate, but
were heard by a very receptive aud-
ience. The Davidson team upheld
the affirmative side of the question,
while the Florida team —attacked
from the negative.

First Speaker

The first speaker for the affirma-
tive was Rice. He began with his
definition of the wealth that is to
be conscripted in the affirmative
plan. It would be a capital levy
on accumulated surplus wealth; it
would be a tax to the government
that would be paid in cash. Dur-
ing the World War there was ex-
cessive profit; 20,000 millionaires
were made as a result of this profit.
The cardinal points of Rice’s speech
was that this conscription of wealth
would wipe’ out debt, would cancel
excess profit, both government and
individual, in time of war, and
would be-fair, just, and democratic,
taking not “bread out of the mouths
of the poor,” as the negative stated,
but conscripting only the surplus
of the rich. Reisner began by stat-
ing that “one of the greatest pow-
ers of capital levy is the prevention
of war;” by the employment of this
plan there will be less chaotic con-
ditions. Other points brought out
by Reisner were that were the plans
adopted, a war could be paid for in
cash, in answer to the negative’s
question, “Can enough income be
raised?” that the wealth having
been correctly evaluated, it can be
collected, and that the plan will
not change the present economic
system, as the collection would be
made by the existing agencies of
the government. ’

Negative Attack

The negative’s main point of at-
tack was the definition of wealth
that the affirmative took; they de-
fined wealth as a forced contribu-
tion, and distinctly stated that the
affirmative plan was not a forced
one. They gave figures to break
down the affirmative argument that
there were great profits during the
World War, and stated that, since
the affirmative definition of wealth
included corporation surplus, they
might notice that 80.per cent of all

Dr. Frazier Hood, Professor of |
Psychology at Davidson, is an en-
thusiastic cabinet worker, and a
“whittler” ofall kinds of wood.

It all began in 1920. Dr. Hood ar-

rived at Davidson with his Vir-
ginia accent, and psychological
training. He made his residence at

Dr. Foreman’s present home. Dr.

Hood requested a carpenter to
come around and fix up his new
abode a bit, but. for some reason

the carpenter delayed a_ consider-
able time. So Dr. Hood purchased
a hammer, saw, and other funda-
mental carpenter's implements, He
then proceeded to “piddle” around
the house, nailing and patching.
This proved to be so fascinating
that the—Psychologist quit his old
hobby of golfing, and continued to

J. B. Ivey & Co.

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who
said they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated
they personally prefer a light smoke.

Miss Jepson verifies the wisdom of this pref-
erence,-and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain
harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
“It’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.

Helen Jepson tells why

LOVELY PRIMA DONNA OF
METROPOLITAN OPERA SAYS:

**“A season of opera and concert
means my voice and throat must
be consistently in perfect condition.
Therefore, although most of my
smoking is done while I am on
vacation, it is all important to me
that I be careful in choosing my
cigarette. I smoke Luckies because
I enjoy their taste and because
I feel it is wiser for me to choose
a light smoke for my voice.”
