Sigma Chi Disaffiliation
Dissention Splits

BY STEVE ROADY
Staff Writer

The Sigma Chi vote to end
its national affiliation last
week did not come without
a fight. In fact, the matter
is still the cause of some
dissention within the house.

Junter Keith Everett and
Bob Buchanan, a senior, this
week discussed the reasons
behind the action, which
came in the form of a 37
14 -vote (with four absten-
tions) to disaffiliate.

Everett cited several rea
sons for the acti$n. The ‘‘so
cial acceptance” clause in
the national Sigma Chi con-
stitution amounts to discrim
ination. against blacks, he
said, and many brothers
have long been opposed to
it.

In addition, the national
office has in the opinion of
some brothers, Everett said,
been less than honest in its
dealings with local Sigma
Chi chapters (including Da
vidson’s chapter) who have
pledged blacks.

At the Sigma Chi national
convention this summer, said
Everett, 10 amendments to
the Constitution were propos
ed, all of which Davidson's
chapter backed, and all of
which were “defeated.

The alumni, _ chapters,
were mainly responsible for
the defeat of these liberal
amendments, said Everett,
as most of the undergradu-
ate chapters voted for them.

The happenings at the
Convention prompted Everett
and Sigma Chi President
Jerry Kroll to begin draw-
ing up this fall a series of
agendas for meetings to re
view the situation. It was
this series of meetings that
ended with the vote to go
local.

Although emphasizing that
the discrimination . question
provided the main impetus
for action, Everett stated
that th@~belief on the part
of some brothers that a na-

‘| tional fraternity was unreal-

istic for Davidson served al
so to sustain the disaffiliation
momentum.

Buchanan agreed that the
discrimination question was
the major source of local
discontent, but he defended
the “less than honest’ ac-—
tions by. the National office
in its dealings with chapters
which have pledged blacks
by asking ‘What are you go-
ing to do in the face of gov-
ernment interference?”

Buchanan doesn’t objéct to
the
clause ‘‘as long as it’s fairly
applied.”

“social acceptance”

The minority regards the
vote as unfair, said Bucha-
nan, because “‘bull pledg2s”
and social affiliates were al-
lowed to vote in add'tion to
initiated brothers. And al

though 2/3 of -those voting
chose to disaffiliate. less
than 2/3 of the initiated
brothers voted to disaffiliate,
he said.

Buchanan also contended
that several brothers voted
to disaffiliate in order to pre
serve house unity,
though’ they
would-have preferred to keep
the charter. ‘I would say
that there are around 20
boys: down there who want
the charter to remain on
campus, and that’s what
we're going to try to do.”

even
themselves

He pointed out that those
who wished to remain affili
ated had presented a com-
promise whereby individual
Sigma Chi's-could have dis
affiliated from the national
office but remained .at the
house.

But this proposal, although
approved by a special com
mittee, was defeated by a
vote of the brothers. Those
who favored going local
asserted that such a plan
would only result in the re
vocation of the local chapter,

since national technically
doesn't allow social affilia
tion.

Buchanan disagrees with
this thesis, stating that he
talked to a province Sigma
Chi official who said that the
local chapter would not have
its, charter revoked if such
individual disaffiliation took
place.

Everett, on the other hand,
asserted that Kroll had been

informed directly from the
national office that the
charter would be revoked

if the compromise were put
into effect.

Everett and Buchanan al
so differ in their outlook on
the future of the former

Sigma Chi house at David-

House

son. Buchanan would say

only that he was pessimistic

for the future while Everett
stated that Davidson's first’
local group plans to go all

out in rush and hopes to form

“a selective
club.”

At 10 a. m. Wednesday
morning, as a part of David

been declared, (2) whether
the South Vietnamese gov
ernment is a desirable alter
native to the Viet Cong, (4)
whether we can achieve our
objectives through military
means, and (5) whether we
are in fact preserving more

On these five counts,
Brinkley condemned the war
in Vietnam. We _ have,- he
said, turned down several
peace initiatives proposed by
the North Vietnamese. He

Dr. Thomas A. Williams,

“something new: love, open

Dr. Robert Lennox, In
structor of Education, quoted
a petition signed by over two
thousand American psycho
logists which said, ‘‘War is
not innate.’’ Lennox claimed
that social engineering can
redirect the —distructive im

he said, would grant a large

Area Exams Before EPC

By GRAY WILSON
Staff Writer

The controversy over area
exams gained momentum
this, week as students pre
sented their opinions and
suggestions to an open ses
sion of the Educational Po
licy Committee.

Danny Clodfelter, expres
sing the general concern of
the sophomores over the
exams, submitted and then
read his two-page statement
to the committee, occasion
ally stopping to explain or
outline a point.

This proposal was the re
sult of a sophomore rally
held last week. It requested
specifically that the Class of
‘72 be exempt from having
to pass the area exams and
that the Class; of ‘73 be re
quired to. pass only two of
the four by graduation. At
tached to the proposal was
a list of 122 signatures.

A variety of other alterna
tives to the exams came
from the floor. Suggestions
included electing regular
courses or long term papers
in place of the exams. The
career-service program and
the honors college were also
offered as possible
tutes for the
ments.
