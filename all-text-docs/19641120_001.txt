Marshall went on to say that
there were 576 parking spaces
on campus for the 300 cars
which used them, exeluding the
ROTC and laundry = spaces
which can be used at night. The
main problem, as he saw it, was
one which the students created
for themselves. He referred to
the fact that students drive to
the library. drive to the Union,
drive to lab, and drive to the
fraternity court for meals while
“it only takes seven and one
half minutes to walk from the
SAE house to the library, the
most widely separated points
on campus.”’

When asked why the area next
to Richardson Dorm couldn't
be turned into parking space,
Marshall said that it is consid

Frank Graham Talks

Informally

Dr. .Frank Porter

former President 0!

North Carolina, former

the Univer-

sity ol
United States Senator, and at
present a representative to the
United Nations, spoke last week-
end the Davidson College
Board of Visitors.

In: an informal
the Board's Friday evening din
ner, Graham stated his views on
the proper role of the United
States in. aiding the underdevel-
oped nations of the world.

The United States should help
these nations in their quest for
a better life, “‘not just because
it is the Christian thing to do,
but for our own survival,”’ Gra-
ham said.

“We have an opportunity for
greatness in sharing our free-
dom and food with the hopeless
and disadvantaged.” Graham
declared, but he warned that if
we do not meet the challenge of
the underdeveloped nations, out
of them might come “‘an explo-
sion that would break through
this thin crust called civiliza-
tion.”

A native of Charlotte, Gra-
ham was graduated from the
University of North Carolina in
1909. He returned to UNC as
professor of history in 1915, and
became President of the Consol-
idated University in 1930. He
served in this position until 1949,
when he was appointed to the
US Senate to fill out the unex-
pired term of the late J. Mel-
ville Broughton.

After his senate term Graham
served in several advisory posi-
tions with the federal govern-
ment and as a representative
for the United Nations. He medi-
ated the dispute between India
and Pakistan over Kashmir un-
til the two countries began di-
rect negotiations with each oth-
er.

Graham remains U. N. repre-
sentative for India and Pakis-
tan over Kashmire until the two
countries began direct negotia-
tions with each other.

Graham remains U. N. repre-
sentative for India and Pakis-
tan and has in recent years be-
come a strong defender of the
United Nations. He now lives in
New York City.

Graham has spoken at David-
son several times in the past,
and was awarded an honorary
Doctor of Laws degree by the
College in 1931.

YMCA Fund Drive
Falls Short Of Goal

The YMCA fund drive ended
this week with a total of $2900
collected from students accord-
ing to campaign chairman Eric
Nichols.

YMCA cabinet members are
still soliciting contributions
from members of the faculty
and administration. Nichols
speculated that the total income
from the fund, including ‘‘sev-
eral hundred dollars still ex-
pected,” will reach $4100. This
is $325 short of the proposed
budget for 1964-65.

“As a result,’’ Nichols added,
“there will not be another
‘Book of the Semester’ as hop-
ed for the second semester.”
The book selected for the cur-
rent semester is John Brain's

President D. Grier Martin commented on David-
son’s goals in the next decade as he addressed the Dav-
idson College Board of Visitors last weekend. These
goals, if accomplished, will bring many changes to
Davidson, while allowing it to maintain its basic integrity
as a small liberal arts college for approximately 1,000

men.

tin expressed a desire that this
trend continued. and he suggest-
ed several changes that could
be made or programs that could

NO IMMEDIATE PLANS

None of these programs have
been definitely arranged or set
up. They are now in the in
cubation stage. Some of these
goals will be realized probably
in few years, while
others will no doubt remain. on

time now, and it hoped that
they can be begun now,” Martin
commented.

Aithough specifics are — not
available on this program, Mar
tin told of his hope that. grad
uate work leading to a masters

field of interest history, Eng
lish, science, ‘etc. spending
his final year at Davidson in
learning the teaching aspects

of the subject. The need for
qualified teachers and _profes-
sors, especially in the South.
would be lessened by this pro-
gram.

LIBRARY EMPHASIZED

Martin also expressed hope
that the resources of the libra-
ry can be quadrupled, as this
will be necessary if advance
study programs can be initiat-
ed. He commented that’ the
overall budget and the libray
budget have both been increas-
ed considerably in recent years,
and that it will have to continue
to increase to fulfill this goal.
“Understandably, some more
money will have to be found
somewhere,’ he remarked.

The Board was also told that
a continuation of the advanced
placement tests for incoming
freshmen will continue, and
more and more students will
probably be graduating in three
years. A special summer school
program in certain fields may
be offered for the freshman be
fore he enters Davidson, and in
this way a capable student
could enter Davidson as a soph-
omore. This program also could

A prediction that the foreign
study programs would be ex-
panded with increased nambers
of students sending their junior
year abroad was made by Mar-
tin. With the great enthusiasm
ond success of this year’s pro-
gram Martin felt that it is

by Martin as a strong possibil-

every indication seems that it
will.

The faculty also will be study-

McGavock: No

By LOUIS LESESNE
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Dr. W. G. McGavock,
professor of mathematics
and chairman of the faculty
committee on athletics, ad-
vocated Wednesday night
that athletics at Davidson
be completely desubsidized.
He spoke at the Open End
program to more than 60
students in the lobby of
the College Union.

McGavock gave a brief back-
ground on the historical aspect
of Davidson athletics, with spec-
jal emphasis on football, dis-
cussed briefly the scholarship
program and the purpose of
collegiate athletics; and then
dwelt at length with several
courses of action open to David-
son, should it attempt to make
necessary changes in the ath
letic program.

NOT AGAINST ATHLETICS

At the very outset, McGavock
Stated, “I want it understood
I'm not against athletics nor
do I want them destroyed. Rath-
er, there have been certain
changes brought about which
make an examination of our
policies necessary." He also
made it clear that he was. speak-
ing as an individual, and his
views were no official pronun-
ciation of any authorities.

In tracing the historical for-

DE-EMPHASIZE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL

Mce-

17-year

tunes of Davidson football
Gavock considered two
periods: from the late 1920's to
World War II, and from
World War II to the
During the pre-war period, Dav-
idson had creditable
against teams that are now
Southern Conference members,
compiling a record of 23 18.

RECENT RECORD

With the post-war era. how-
ever, Davidson found itself be-
ing dropped by many schools
building big-time programs,
while Davidson was subsidizing
on a relatively small scale. The
result, according to McGavock,
is that “in the last 17 years, we
have a record of 19-63 against
Southern Conference teams, win
ning only 21% of these games.
Against non-conference foes the
record is 39-32; however, this
is against teams like Wofford,
Lehigh, and Lafayette, rather
than Duke, UNC, and NC
State."

McGavock said Davidson
now experiencing the same
phase which it underwent di
rectly after the war. except that
now it is Southern Conference
schools that are dropping Dav-
idson. For instance. he cites,
“We have never played West
Virginia. George Washington on
ly once; and VMI is cancelling
their contract after next year.
As a result, scheduling games

is

has become more and more dif-
ficult.”
ON SCHOLARSHIPS

On the subject of scholarships
McGavock sees the present
system as very inequitable. He
pointed out that in awarding
academic scholarships, the
amount is based on need, and
many students at Davidson have
only honorary scholarships, be
cause of the financial status of
their families.

“In contrast, consider,’’ Mc-
Gavock conrtinued, ‘‘that a good
football player can come from
a wealthy family, make low
scores on his College Boards
have poor grades, and still be
given $1800 for playing football
at Davidson. In addition. of
the 30 scholarships at Davidson
worth more than $1500, all are
athletic. All in all, the system
seems to me to be very unreal-
istic.”

Speaking briefly on the pur-
pose of collegiate athletics. Mc
Gavock noted that several reas-
usually advanced
which were not applicable to
Davidson. Among these ‘are
making money, as a means of
contacting alumni, and publi
city. Rather, the basic purpose
should be for “the develop-
ment, enjoyment, and participa-
tion of the students of the col-
lege.”

CHANGES OUTLINED
Using this tenet as the basis

ons were

for any reforms that might be
McGavock listed 10
which had been sug
gested: of these, he rejected
seven with no discussion, and
spent the rest of his talk con-
sidering three of the more real
istic ones.

The first suggestion was that
several more football scholar-
ships be added and leave the
rest of the athletic program
unchanged. However, McGav
ock stated that this would be no
solution to the problem, for the
base of the problem not
found in mere lack of scholar-
ships.

One outstanding
Davidson's academic standards
which surpass those of other
Southern Conference schools,
making it more difficult to at
tract high caliber athletes.

McGavock next discussed a
second and more popular pro-
posal: to desubsidize football
and subsidize basketball *‘to the
hilt." In light of recent bask
etball success, this might seem
to be the most reasonable solu-
tion. However, McGavock re
minded his audience that it
would be unreasonable to as
soume that the basketball team
could continue outstanding
record indefinitely.

McGavock suggested that an
even more serious drawback in
this solution would be that “‘it
would mess. up conference re-
lations, making the problem of

scheduling very. difficult, espe
cially ‘for the minor sports.”

According to Southern Confer-
ence by-laws a member is not
required to field a subsidized
football team; but according to
Athletic Director Tom _ Scott,
who was in the audience, in a
query sent to Lloyd Jordan,
Southern Conference commis-
sioner, Jordan stated that he
was of the opinion that “David
son would be asked to withdraw
if it did not have a subsidized
football team.”

DESUBSIDIZATION

McGavock’s third proposal,
which he openly supported. was
complete desubsidization of al!
sports and joining the College
Athletic Conference. According
to McGavock, “The CAC was
founded in 1961 and is definitely
on the rise.

“It composed of schools
with which Davidson would be
proud to be associated. Mem-

is

bers are Sewanee. Center,
Washington and Lee, Southwest
ern, and Washington at St.
Louis,” he added.

One of McGavock’s main sell-
ing points was the high caliber
of schools belonging to the
CAC. He noted, “Of the top
three liberal arts colleges in the
South. Davidson, Sewanee. and
W&L are usually mentioned to
gether. I think a natural rival-
ry with these schools would de
velop within a very short period
of time.”
