Davidsonian Staff Reports

Davidson’s Ben Hayes, a so-
phomore from Winston-Salem,
was named the Big South Confer-
ence Soccer Player of the Week

a 2-0 conference win over UNC-
Asheville October 19.

The goals were his third and
fourth of the season, and gave him

Davidsonian Staff Reports

The Davidson women’s tennis
team turned in a pair of strong
tournament showings during the
lasttwo weeks tocap offa busy fall
season. The Wildcats dominated
their own Davidson Tournament
October 18-20 and then had sev-
eral fine individual performa nces
at the UNCC Tournament last
weekend.

At the Davidson Tournament,
East Tennessee State and Western
Carolina of the Southern Confer-
ence and UNC-Greensboro could
offer little challenge to the Wild-
cats. An abbreviated 6-2 victory
over UNC-G, an 11-1 thumping of
ETSU and a 12-0 thrashing of
WCU gave the team a cumulative
record of 29-3.

Even coach Caroline Brown-
Price was surprised at the ease
with which her team won its
matches. “Literally, we dominated
play, which was surprising,” she
said. “Butupon reflection, we really
had improved that much,” Price

attributes that improvement to a
competitive fall schedule, and the
effects of strength training under-
Beth Manson and mental training.

’ The tournament the following
week at UNCC featured some of
the top teams in the Southeast,
including top 20 team Kentucky.
Once again, the team played to the
top of its game. Said Price, “We
had strong performances every-
where; there were no disappoint-
ments.”

Davidson # 1 player Cyndi
Hess won the Ist Flight Consola-
tion Bracket. Her only loss of the
tournament came to the eventual
champion, an Estonian exportplay-
ing for Virginia Commonwealth,
and Hess was the only person to
take a set from her. In Flight 2,
freshman Kimberley Nance suf-
fered a 3-set loss in the Consola-
tion final, but played what Price
called the best tennis of her young
career.

Freshman Rebecca Billingsley

ing the title with a 6-1, 6-1 whip-
ping of her Furman opponent. In
the Flight 4 Consolation, senior
Mary Faith Mount emerged victo-
rious with a 6-3, 6-1 win over her
foe from UNCC.

The doubles play also sparked
praise from Price. She called the
Davidson showing “the best
doubles we’ve played, period”
during her 8-year tenure as coach.
Sophomores Tasha Ruth and Bar-
baraGrooms made it to the Conso-
lation Final of the First Flight be-
fore losing, and the entire team
received acknowledgement from
the other coaches and players for
their fine play.

Davidson’s fall season will
conclude next weekend in individ-
ual competition at the Sectional
Tourgament at N.C. State. Sopho-
mores Hess and Jennifer, Beahm
and freshman Kimberley Nance
have been nominated to represent
Davidson there.
