Anyone who thought the
Davidson men’s basketball team
would have a slow game after
Saturday night’s highly emotional
blowout of Tennessee-Chat-
tanooga would have had a legiti-
mate concern. Unfortunately for
Western Carolina, Davidson
played with a vengeance rather
than a letdown and dominated the
Catamounts to the tune of 92-71
Monday night.

The win over Western
Carolina moves Davidson to a 10-
4 record on the season, equaling
last year’s number of wins, and a
perfect 3-0 in the Southern Con-
ference. Davidson leads the early
race for the conference crown and
is the only undefeated team in the
conference. :

The keys to the game for
Davidson were defense and mus-
cle. Davidson, using both zones
and an aggressive man-to-man de-
fense, took Western Carolina out
of their offense midway through
the first half and never let them

back in the game.

Physically speaking, in addi-
tion to sending two Western
players to the sidelines with minor
injuries, Davidson pinned a 38-32
advantage on the boards, a margin
made much closer than it really
was by a surge in Western re-
bounding late in the game when
Davidson's starters were on the
bench watching their teammates
get a chance to play.

Senior Gerry Born played
another outstanding game. In ad-
dition to leading Davidson’s ef-
forts under the boards with 10 re-
bounds and scoring 14 points,
Born sparked a nine-point run by
the Wildcats in the first half with a
three-point play and a layup. This
run allowed Davidson to break
away from Western and gain a 27-
14 advantage with 9:13 remaining
in the half. Davidson controlled

on.

The first half ended on a rather
spectacular note when junior Ace
Tanner was fouled in the process
of dunking. The basket counted

Women beat Meredith

By MIKE ADAMS
After building a 33-20
halftime lead, the Davidson

women’s basketball team fought
off a second half comeback to win
59-46 at Meredith College.

The Lady Cats used a strong
defense in the first half in building
their 13-point lead. They mainly
used a 3-2 zone, but they took
Meredith’s women out of their of-
fense with a tough man-to-man
defense toward the end of the half.
The man-to-man created several
turnovers and contributed to the
double digit lead the Cats held at
halftime.

Lady Cats

By PAM HARMANN

The Davidson women’s bas-
ketball team firmly defeated
Methodist College Wednesday
night 68-57. This means the Lady
Cats now have a winning record of
5-3.

As far as Wednesday goes,
during the first half Davidson shot
a cold 16 percent from the floor.
Though the shot selection was
good, the inside shots were weak
and off balance due to the oppos-
ing center.

Davidson came out strong the
second half when down by three
points, took the same shots and
made a much improved 52 per-
cent. Junior co-captain Heather
McKee led the scoring with 18
points, followed by freshman
Lavetta Dawkins with 16 points,
and juniors Jen Artman and Pam

half and quickly closed the 13-
point gap. The teams stayed fairly
close for the first 15 minutes of the
second half, until Davidson pulled
away for good in the last five mi-
nutes.

Junior forward Heather
McKee, who grabbed ten re-
bounds while scoring ten points,
said, “Good shot selection and
good defensive rebounds in the
last minutes caused us to pull
away.”

The Lady Cats were led by
junior Jen Artman, who scored 23
points mainly from _ outside.
Freshman Lavetta Dawkins had
14 points and ten rebounds for
Davidson.

and Tanner stepped to the line for
two shots due to the official call-
ing an intentional foul. Tanner
connected on one of the two shots
and Davidson took a 47-29 lead
and a great deal of momentum into
the locker room.

The second half saw the
Wildcats expand their lead to as
much as 29 points with everyone
getting a chance to play. Davidson
cruised to an easy win due to
another fine team effort. Senior
Pepper Bego played aggressively
all over the court, taking full ad-
vantage of the opportunity to start
due to an ankle injury to junior
Chris Heineman. Sophomores
Jeff Himes and Todd Scott also
gave inspired efforts, scoring nine
and eight points each. Tanner pro-
vided solid excitement every mi-
nute he played, piling up 15
points, including four dunks, and
a lot of turnovers at both ends of
the court.

Despite all the fine play from
sO many members of the team,
Davidson has the tremendous start
in the conference race that they
have due to strong rebounding
from Born and the tremendous
leadership of sophomore point
guard Derek Rucker. Rucker
played a nearly flawless game
against Western, scoring a team
high 20 points, handing out seven
assists and making three steals in
what was actually a short game for
him (29 minutes). When Rucker
plays well, the rest of the team
usually follows. Even when
Rucker has a bad night, his com-
petitiveness and composure allow
him to make his teammates play
better. As the conference race
moves onward, Rucker will need
to continue to play well for David-
son to maintain the torrid pace
they are on.

Conference titles are won on
the road and the road calls for
Davidson. The Wildcats will face

win second straight

Harmann with 13 and 10 points re-
spectively.

Davidson played a strong 3-2
defense, caused 22 turnovers,
biucked eight shots, and did ex-
tremely well on the defensive
boards. Rebounding was led by
Harmann with 12, Artman with
ten, McKee with nine and Daw-
kins with eight.

Coach Patty Daley feels that
“‘we are learning how to keep our
composure and keep to our game
plan — even under pressure. This
is the experience we will need to
be successful in close games.”

This is exactly what the Lady
Cats did against Methodist. Al-
though down by three points at
halftime, they played an excellent
second half and never gave up.

‘They flustered the Methodist

women enough to cause many tur-

novers and went on to a significant
win.

Even though the women’s
team is having such an excellent
season, there are a few points that
need improvement. Daley feels
the man-to-man offense is still a
little rusty. Each player needs to
be confident with the ball and able
to take it to the basket. Hopefully ,
as the season progreses the players
will feel more confident with the
offense.

Daley’s outlook for the rest of
the season “‘is very positive. The
growth so far has been tremend-
ous. We have a highly versatile
team. I look for us to continue our
growth and improvement which
will hopefully produce the first
winning season and due recogni-
tion in years.”
