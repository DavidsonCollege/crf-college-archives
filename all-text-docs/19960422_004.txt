ficers, number of members, and
any amendments made to the
group’s constitution.

The Charters and By-laws
Committee evaluates applications
and passes all organizations’ re-
quests for charter renewal to the
Senate either with or without com-
mittee recommendation. Finally,
a Senate vote either grants or de-
nies charter renewal.

- Usyally, this formal procedure
is completed uneventfully, and all
charter requests are granted. How-
ever, last week the SGA renewed
the charters of only 14 of the 15
student organizations requesting
renewal.

After lengthy debate initiated
by sophomore Senator Eric Sapp’s
motion thatthe SGA renew IVCF’s
charter without the Charter and
By-laws Committee’s recommen-
dation, the motion was tabled until
next Tuesday’s meeting.

According to Sabel, “This is
the first time in my four years on
SGA [that an organization has not
been recommended for charter re-
newal].”

SGA by-laws recognize that
“All students have equal rights and
responsibilities under the Davidson
College Constitution” (Article I,
A2) and the Davidson College
non-discrimination policy reads,
“Davidson College ... administers
all educational and employment
activities without discrimination
because of race, color, religion,
national origin, age, disability, sex,
or sexual orientation except where
exemption is appropriate and al-
lowed by law.”

Committee members felt that
aportion of the InterVarsity Chris-

tian Fellowship Constitution at
Davidson College which sets forth
leadership restrictions and require-
ments conflicted with these poli-
cies.

Specifically, IVCF’s consti-
tution mandates that “To be con-
sidered for leadership in this orga-
nization individuals should dem-
onstrate lives...free of patterns of
gossip and slander; drunkenness;
sexual immorality, including the
practice of homosexuality, or the
inappropriate practice of hetero-
sexual activity outside of the mar-

_Yiage context; selfish ambition;

hatred; lewdness; and 'the like.”
(Article V, Section 1)

Student opinion on the issue is
clearly divided. While some stu-
dents and senators see IVCF’s
policy as blatantly discriminatory
on the basis of sexual orientation,
others view IVCF’s leadership re-
quirements as a matter of religious
conviction, and argue that IVCF’s
freedom of religious expression i
protected by law. :

Macon Stokes, a junior and
the President of IVCF, believes,
“This is an issue of a religious
organization’s ability to hold and
abide by its own religious convic-
tions. Itis my hope,” he says, “that
when people dispassionately view
all the facts of the entire issue, they
willcometothe same conclusion.”

Stokes explains, “As a Chris-
tian organization, one of our pur-
poses is to make disciples and
present the gospel to the campus.”

Although stipulations exist
concerning IVCF’s leadership, the
constitution states that “member-
ship and participation in this orga-
nization is open to all student and
faculty members.” (Article IV, Sec-
tion 1)

No official membership list
exists, but Stokes estimates that
between 90 and 120 students main-

Anthropology professor receives
Guggenheim, “most prized recognition
of superior scholarship in America”

By NARESH NAGELLA
Assistant News Editor

Rosemary Zumwalt, chair-
person of the: department of
anthropology,will get to shape a
piece of history dealing with some-
thing she cares about deeply.

She has received Davidson’s
first Guggenheim fellowship. It is
an award that Dean of Academic
Affairs Robert Williams calls,
“Perhaps the most prized recogni-
tion of superior scholarship in
academia.”

The Fellowship will allow
Zumwalt to study how the founder
of anthropology, Franz Boas,
shaped its modern form through a
personal relationship with students
and scholarly letters.

Zumwalt commented, “A

Guggenheim is something I never
thought I'd get. It’s like a cloud in
the sky — unreachable. I feel very
honored.”

The Fellowship will allow
Zumwalt to spend her next year,
her sabbatical year, to travel
around the country to visit ar-
chives and read original letters of
Boas and his students.

She will work in the Ameri-
can Philosophical Society Library,
Columbia University (where Boas
taught), in Washington’s National
Archives, and at Vassar Univer-
sity.

She hopes to research Boas’
influence on other notable figures
such as Margaret Mead, Ruth
Benedict, and Alfred Louis
Koeber at these places.

She calls this aspect of her

work the most “serendipitous” be-
cause it entails finding Boas influ-
ence on other people,

She says, “It’s like a puzzle,
since you have to find the pieces .
and fit them together. “

While the actual research will
take about one year, Zumwalt’s
planned book will take much longer
to publish.

Of Boas, she says, “I sense a
personal connection with him. All
anthropologists probably feel a kin-
ship with him.”

Clearly, Zumwalt is up to her
challenge, considering her task a
labor of love. She states, “T’ll enjoy
the challenge of the task. I’m happy
to have the opportunity to study a
man so important and to be able to
grasp the excitement of his times.”

tain more than passing involve-
ment in the group, through partici-

_ pation in weekly meetings and

weekly small group Bible studies.

Until last semester, no spe-
cific mention of the practice of
homosexuality was made in the
group’s constitution. However,
after an incident last year in which
an abstinate homosexual student
was discouraged by an IVCF staff
member from submitting his ap-
plication for IVCF leadership,
Davidson College administration
asked IVCF to outline its leader-
ship requirements “so that what
was [a tacit understanding of reli-
gious faith by IVCF leaders] be
made specific,” says Stokes.

Itis this constitutional amend-
ment which concerns the Charters
and By-laws Committee as well as
many students.

Rob Knight, a sophomore,
identified himself Tuesday evening
as the homosexual student who
had desired to apply for an IVCF
leadership position last year.
Knight stresses the nature of his
involvement in IVCF at the time,
saying, “I was a highly involved
and very motivated member of
IVCF so [being informed that he
was ineligible for leadership in the
organization] came as a big sur-
prise to me.”

AtTuesday’s meeting, Warner
House Senator Stephanie Morgan,
a senior, agreed with the recom-
mendation and voiced her reserva-
tions with what she saw as a con-
tradiction in renewing the charter
of a discriminatory organization,
which would effectively make
IVCF a part of the SGA, when
SGA by-laws clearly prohibit dis-
crimination by the SGA Senate.

Senior Carol Steele agrees.
“TVCF should not be given a char-
ter. If the SGA does [renew it],”
she says, “the school is in effect
condoning discrimination.”

Knight says that in his mind,
“the IVCF constitution and the by-
laws of the SGA are obviously in
opposition [and therefore] they can-
not co-exist.” In addition, Knight
states, “IVCF is not a religion, itis

a religious organization,” which
can continue to practice accord-
ing to their religious beliefs re-
gardless of whether their charter
is renewed by the SGA.

However, Stokes stresses that
“we're not singling out [homo-
sexual] behavior,” and that prac-
ticing homosexuals are not the
only individuals prohibited from
becoming IVCF leaders. Stokes
says that the official qualities for
leadership reflect “how we under-
stand a life in pursuit of Christ....
We wouldn’t want someone who
hated homosexuals in leadership.”

Junior Andy Morris, who has
served as a Bible study leader for
three semesters, ‘adds, “We want
[as a leader] someone who loves
everyone regardless of what they
do.” Morris notes that love is not,
however, synonymous with ap-
proval.

Despite these arguments, not
all students are convinced. Fresh-
man Meredith Judy asks, “This is
an educational institution. How
can we deny any individual the
opportunity to explore all aspects
of student life?”

Yet student support for IVCF
does exist. Following Tuesday’s
meeting, Sapp said that he viewed

the SGA’s hesitancy in renewing

IVCF’s charter as “telling a reli-
gious organization, ‘If you don’t
change your beliefs to what we
believe, your charter will be re-
voked’.” As the President of Fel-
lowship of Christian Athletes, a
religious student organization
whose charter was renewed by the
SGA last week, Sapp says that
FCA has no “written require-
ments” for FCA leadership.
Senator Sarah Terry, a jun-
ior, says, “To me, IV holds a posi-
tion which they base on Biblical
tradition and understanding.” The
issue as Terry sees it, is one of
freedom of religious expression,
and she explains, “I feel that IV
does not violate any of the re-
quirements for granting the char-

In terms of the SGA’s final
vote on the status of IVCF’s char-
ter, the technicalities of SGA by-
laws may prove to be the decisive
factor in the charter renewal issue.

Tom Shandley, Vice President
of student life and Dean of Stu-
dents, says, “It’s important for stu-
dent government to make sure not
to violate the protected rights of the
organization.” Addressing the Sen-
ate at Tuesday’s meeting, Shandley
urged senators to determine whether
IVCF is protected by law. “You
don’t have the right’ to break the
law,” he said.

ter.

Counsel Bart Landess notes that

the charter requirements and re-
strictions stipulate “nondiscrimina-
tion as to membership. From what
Iunderstand,” he says, according to
the Davidson College 1996 Student
Organization Handbook, “‘charter-
ing doesn’t have a leadership dis-
crimination clause.”

In fact, in listing the guidelines .
for the “determination of an
organization’s eligibility for a char-
ter,’ the 1996 Handbook states:
“Membership in the organization
must be open to any member of the
student body.” No requirements or
restrictions concerning leadership
are mentioned.

Yeteven this presumably clear-
cut matter of policy gives rise to
different interpretation. Sophomore
Anthony Macaronis states that in
his view, “To be a leader of an
organization you are implicitly a
member.”

SGA President Warren Buford
says that “the SGA has the power
and the responsibility to give orga-
nizations charters,” but notes, “If
we don’t [grant an organization
charter] the College President has
the ability to override our decision.”
However, Buford says, “I think
[next] Tuesday’s debate will shape
and clarify some of the issues and
concerns.”
