THE DAVIDSONIAN

Episcopal Bishop

The Rev. Thoma Fraser, Jr.
Bishop Coadjutor of the Diocese
of North Carolina, will conduct

program. Opinions of both the
faculty and the students in the
course are still only tentative,
Since the real value of the pro-
tam can only be found after
the entire course has been com-
pleted.

Nost freshmen in the pro-
gram, it seems, agree with
Rhodes in these respects. In a
sample poll of students, every
one Said that the program had
progressed about as well as
could be expected. The point
that most agreed on was that the
course should extend no more
than two years.

Rhodes outlined briefly the
second year program and made
a few general observations about
it. The faculty group teaching
this course of study during the
sophomore year has been work-
ang since last summer to prepare
for the first classes in the fall.
The syllabus of this year’s work
will not be quite as detailed and
will not contain as many direct-
ed questions, since a year's ex-
perience will enable next year’s
students to be more in control
of the reading materials.

The basic alms and princi-
ples governing the second part
pt the course will remain the
seme, however, and similer
but not duplicating patterns
of study will be used. The em-
phasis will be placed on
Europe and North Americe
from the Rensissance to the
beginning of the twentieth
century. with particular stress
en the political, historical,
religious, philosophical, esien-
tifle, and literary trends of
the period,

year’s work,” said Rhodes, bas

in the program to a bare mini-
mum. He feels the professors

Fine Arts Festival
Schedules Talent

The theme for the 16th annual
fine Arts Festival, which will
begin April 8, is ‘The Inter-
relation of the Arts.”

Professors Frank Engle and
Charles O. Delaney will be on
campus in connection with the
festival.

Engle,*a professor of fine
arts from the University of Ala-
bama, will arrive Monday, April
8. Bringing paintings, sculpture,
drawings, and ceramics for ex-
hibition here, he will speak on
“The Dichotemy of Art” at noon
Monday to the art classes. He
will also be present at an infor-
mal studio party in Hodson Hall,
Where he will speak on “What
the Artist Finds Meaningful.”

Delaney will arrive Thursday,
April 11. A Davidson graduate,
he is on the music faculty at the
University of Mlinois. Delaney
will’ show the inter-relation of
photography, music, and poetry
by presenting a program of
slides of the Georgia marshes,
accompanied by his own musical
composition, both of which were
suggested by the poetry of Sid-
ney Lanier.

Student activities in the areas
of art, music, and scenery in
Student plays will be judged,
and prizes will be awarded. Also
a musical program with Dr.
Grier Williams and the Wind

promised that this constant re-

would continue as long as tie
program remains in effect.

The freshmen who were poll-
ed claimed that one problem was
“getting to know” the different
professors. Each professor's
grading system, his method of
discussion, and his knowledge
of the topic are all different;
but they are important to know
in order to profit from the dis-
cussion groups.

Some students disagreed as
to the value of the program
compared to the other basic
freshmen courses. One stud
ent claimed the work was

Well, both of these events will
occur a week from tonight be-
ginning at 8 p.m if Union
President Ben Cole has his way.
This is the night of the Union’s
first spring party, which will fea-
ture a pie-throwing contest and
perhaps Miss Mansfield, who has
been invited.

The gale affair will have the
atmosphere of 8 carnival, with
plenty of decorations, con-
tests, and prizes renging from
packs of cigarettes to hard
bound books, record albums,
and teddy bears. And the best
pert of it all will be a chance
to hit the dean of students (in
fun, of course) end other
faculty members with cream-
of-tartar pies.

An entire room wilt be re-
served for the pie-throwing, and
it will be actually more of a
show than a contest. Anyone
may enter the room where the
drama takes place for a mere
penny and may throw three pies
for a dime at whoever happens

to be the unlucky target of
wrath at a particular time.

There will be at least six differ-
ent targets in the room during
the party, which lasts until 12
p.m.

Definite ones that have al-
ready agreed to the pie massacre
include, in addition to Dean
Burts. Dr. Sam Maloney, Chap-
lain Will Terry, and a surprise
guest who will have no choice
but to pose for the throwers.

But in case anyone is anfti-
cipating foo pleasant an eve-
ning watching hated profes-
sors or despised colleagues get

plastered by pies, there is a

slight catch which deserves to

be mentioned.

After the room is filled with
spectators, four names will be
sea from among them who
must also pose as targets for the
hurlers. Girls and professors
‘who have stepped in to watch
the fun will not be excluded
from becoming a possible target.

There is a chance that stud-
ents will miss the sexy Jayne
Mansfield, however. Cole stress-
led the fact that even though a
letter had been sent to her

“Hf | had it to do over again,

Look at it this way. I like the idea of doing challenging
work. That’s why | volunteered for Special Forces. So
you can see why I felt pretty good when the Army assigned
me to Europe! Here I really feel I’m doing something for
the cause of my country in these important times. How
many jobs can you think of that start you off with this
kind of responsibility? My wife’s here, too, and she loves
it. We get a chance to travel. We meet the people, learn
new languages, customs. And there’s a pretty active
social life on post, too. But above all, I’m an officer with
a job to do and with responsibilities to shoulder. I like
it that way, and I have a hunch that my leadership train-
ing and experience will help me out whatever I do. Take
it from me, if you’re already half-way towards your
commission, see it through. It’s a good deal. I know.”
