Means to an end

Solidarity Week. Black History Month. Earth Day. Africa Week. The Year
of the Woman. AIDS Awareness Week. International Night.

As commendable as it is to recognize groups and causes by allocating time
for appreciation, one must question the merit of concentrating that appreciation
into a limited time period. Once the day, week, or year is over, what has changed?

Certainly our education about black history should be continuous, and not
merely a month-long process. AIDS Awareness unarguably deserves more than
a week. And as the slogan says, “Every day should be Earth Day.”

But here we have a dilemma: How can awareness be maintained constantly?

Think of Independence Day. Do we forget that America fought for its
freedom against England and became a champion of individuality and hope
every day other than July 4? Of course not — the Fourth of July is just the day
on which we honor that history. The spirit of America’s freedom is so ingrained
in our culture and such a part of our lives that it is never forgotten or minimalized;
in fact, we value it so much that we choose to celebrate it on a certain date once
a year. ¥

So, in order to insure the constant building of awareness and appreciation, the
respective aspect of the culture must become an integral part of society.

Is this happening, or would awareness be maintained without these dedica-
tory times? In other words, can a person be held accountable for knowledge of

. the present need at this point in our nation’s cultural development?

At this point, no. The purpose of Solidarity Week, the Year of the Woman,
etc., is to show that so much more could be done. For centuries, there has been
asilent celebration of majority history, and events like Africa Week highlight the
lack of actual attention we pay to extremely important, yet margainalized,
elements of our society. :

When they end, we cannot go back to business as usual, but we must move
forward and advance the awareness past the limitations of a calendar of events.
Solidarity Week will become Solidarity Month, Solidarity Year, and eventually
— ideally — actual solidarity.

We must use this ‘affirmative action” to better ourselves, our campus, and
our nation. We must work toward atime when tributes like these are unnecessary.

Let’s clear some things up

To the editors,

Iam glad that my article
received such a response. I
am only sorry that some
people were not mature
enough to do anything other
than leave anonymous in-
sults (I thought we were all
more grown up than that).
However, to those of you
who called me, or anyone
who thought about my ar-
ticle and what it actually said
instead of getting all emo-
tional — thank you.

I do need to start this
second article with an apol-
ogy. There was a typo in the
title which I did not intend. I
meant the title to be stated as
a question, but as a joke with
a friend who is a biology
major, I removed the ques-
tion mark. Then I forgot to
put it back. I am not saying
that I have changed my ar-
gument, but I did mean for
there to be a question mark
after the title, and I am sorry
it was left out.

Talso need to clear up a

|couple of misconceptions

that seemed to appear about
my article. First, I never
claimed to prove Creation-
ism; in fact, the word was
never even brought up in my
article. I do not feel that I
have to present another sci-
entifically acceptable solu-
tion to a question if I am
simply stating that the one
we have now is majorly

flawed. I am also not deny-
ing that itis called the theory
of evolution. Itis not taught
as theory, however, but as
fact. That is the whole point
of my last article. The
“theory” is taught as fact
and the problems with the
theory are left out when it is
taught. To me, that is not
scientific. To quote from
the Campbell biology book
(the book used in some intro
biology classes _ at
Davidson): “Evolution re-
fers to the processes that
have transformed life on
Earth from the earliest form
to the vast diversity that
characterizes ittoday ...evo-
lution is the most pervasive
principle in biology, and a
thematic thread woven

throughout this book.”

Later this book goes on to
discuss the “theory” part of
evolution: “The conclusion
that life has evolved is based
on historical fact.” Now I
don’t know about you, but
that does not sound like it is
being taughtas just atheory.
There is a great deal more
describing the accepted
“truth” behind evolution in
this book. I think that any-
one reading pages 420-436
will reconsider the argu-
ment that evolution is only
taught as a theory.

A number of people
concentrated on my argu-
ment about the Second Law

of Thermodynamics, and I

heard a large number of de-

cent arguments against it. I

also had an enlightening con-

versation with Ken May, and

he gave an interesting argu-

ment, questioning some of

my sources. To the question

of my not stating all my

sources or not addressing all

the arguments in their en-

tirety, people must realize

that lam not writing a paper.

I am writing an article, and

therefore I cannot go into

incredible detail on each ar-

gument. The arguments that

I gave were all counter argu-

ments to evolution. I will
admit that some are better
founded than others. How-
ever, I do not,think that.

of anes be dleprived.

- Thereis always some chance

that they are right. Sure,
Eric, but just because an ar-
gument is possible doesn’t
make it right. I will grant
that I may have come across
as too sure of my arguments,
but that has been my point
the whole time. Evolutionis _
being taught as fact by our
books, our society, and most
of our teachers just because
it is possible and we don’t
have anything better. Iknow
that some teachers present
evolution truly as just one of
the theories; hats off to those
teachers. That is exactly

See Evolution on page 8

Keep it up, Crazy Cats

To the editors,

Allof us hear and know
the Crazy Cats. They are
very good people. They are
well intentioned. They are
about their classmates and
their schoolmates, male ath-
letes and female athletes, fall
sport, winter sport, or spring
sport. We hear their voices
of support, and this inspires
our team. It creates an envi-
ronment of excitementin the
Belk Arena for all of us. In
team competition, like bas-
ketball, where you have the
opportunity to play offense
and defense, a major part of
our objective is to discon-
cert our opponent. We are
thankful and grateful to the

Crazy Cats for lending their
support in that process.
The opposing arenas in
this conference are dens of
verbal abuse and taunting
from every nook andcranny.
You would have to share a
seat with us on the bench or
watch and listen to a replay
of any game to understand
the kind of abuse that we
receive on the road. We do
not condone that kind of
behavior nor do we encour-
age our own fans to support
us in such a way. We be-
lieve that we have some-
thing very special and
unique here at Davidson.
However, we do be-
lieve that getting an oppos-

ing team’s attention is part of
the process of giving your
team ahome court edge. We
understand that our fans want
to see an excellent perfor-
mance and applaud such ex-
cellence. We also recognize
that our fans want to see the
Davidson Wildcats win, It’s
not adesire to win at all costs,
but at the cost of investing
one’s heart, soul, lungs,
voices, and hands to that very
vital process of support. Very
clearly, we want fans, not
spectators. Thank you, Crazy
Cats, for being such great
fans.
Sincerely, “%
Davidson Men’s
Basketball Team
