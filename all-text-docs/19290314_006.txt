THE DAVIDSONIAN

Blue Ridge Program: For
This Year Offers Much

Few Student Conferences of the past
have been in position to announce such
World statesman, T. Z. Koo, Interpreter
speakers as Fletcher Brockman, Christian
of the Orient to the West and inimitable
in his presentation of the heart of the
Christian message, an@ Dr. Henry Crane,
perhaps the most accepable speaker today
to students of the “astern coileges and
universities. Two speakers of this caliber.
will be announced later.

The Guidance Motif Dominant

Certain major life adjustments con-
front students during their four years
in college. They must decide what they
are going to do about vocation, girls, re-
ligion, the church, education, etc., which
proves a baffling experience. Most are
puzzled by the difficulties involved. Many
make their choices blindly and disastrous-
ly. Decison is often forced without ade-
quate consideration of all the facts, either
because they are not available or for lack
of time. A need voiced by students every-
where is for sympathetic and able guid-
ance in these areas,

What student would not welcome the
opportunity to spend a period in intimate
daily contact with a group of outstand-
ing older Christian men skilled in coun-
selling? That is just what Blue Ridge
is prepared to do this coming summer.
With adequate provision for personal con-
ference, forum and group discussion, in-
spiring presentations and ample time for
quiet meditation, in the seclusion of the
mountains, an almost unparalled opportu-
nity is made available. The best skilled
leadership to be found is being drawn
from colleges and universities both North
and South. For the vocational counsell-
ing service there will be a group of coun-
sellors selected from Southern colleges,
who will give their whole thought and
time to the personal needs of individual
students. This part of the program is
being planned and carried through by a
group of college deans under the Chair-
manship of President H. W. Chase, of
the University of North Carolina, Dean
Francis F, Bradshaw has been secured
as expert leader of this group in the field
of counselling, and associated with him
will be Mr. Harry Bone, of Columbia
University and Union Seminary on cam-
pus life adjustments and Dr. English
Bagby, well known expert in the psychol-
ogy of personality. These three leaders
with the group of twenty-five choice coun-
sellors selected from the more important
institutions in the South will provide a
service quite unique in the quality of its
personnel and the service to be rendered.

High Grade Bible Study

Rare, indeed, will be the privileges of
those who attended the conference this
year in their opportunity to expefience
such interpretations of the Bible as will
be provided under the leadership of Dr.
Bruce Curry, of New York, Dr. William
J. Hutchins, of Berea College, Mr. Harry
Bone of the National Council of Y. M.
C. A.’s, Dr. J. M. Culbreath, of the
Methodist Board of Education, and Dr.
H. M. LeSourd, of Duke University, This
has been arranged in answer to the strong
ly expressed desire on the part of students
for opportunity to gain an inspiring ac-
quaintance with the Bible.

Interest and Technique Groups

Running through the Conference will
be a number of smaller interest groups
delving into such questions. as students
themselves may choose for discussion in
relation to the application of Christian
Principles to problems on the campus and
in the community. The latter half of the
conference will be devoted in these same
groups to the discussion of the kind of
Programs that can actually be carried
out through the Christian
back in the colleges. Such leaders as
Harry Bone, Dr. R. E. Baber, Dr. W.
W. Alexander, Mr, Harry Comer, Dr.
William J. Hutchins and others of. like
caliber will be the resource men for these
groups.

Association

Recreation

This phase of the Conference will be
in charge of competent athletic directors
who will help organize the sports, tennis,
basketball, swimming, rowing, track, hik-
ing, etc. The afternoons will be complete-
ly devoted to these activities or to such
recreation as the delegates themselves
may chose. Tournaments will be arrang-
ed, in which the delegations with suffi-

cient number can participate.

Sings :
One of the most pleasurable features
of the Conference comes each evening af-
ter supper when at the “lobby sing” stud-

ents share each others college songs and
join together in both popular songs and
old favorites. It is in an informal expres-
sion of this nature that fellowship is en-
riched and a warmth of friendship devel-
ops between men from the many different
campuses represented.

These are some of the values that will
go to make the annual Student Confer-
ence at Blue Ridge a memorable event
in the lives of those discriminating stud-
ents who chose to invest two weeks of
the next vacation period in one of the
most inspiring and altogether satisfying
experiences that comes in a lifetime.

Jubilant Freshmen

Discard Class Caps

By a special edict of the Court of Con-
trols the freshmen have been allowed to
discard their caps. The announcement
was made in chapel Saturday morning.
Immediately, the crowd of excited fresh-
men rushed out on the campus and walk-
ed about without the little emblems of
fresh-hood for the first time since their
advent to the college last September.
This is the earliest any class in the last
few years has been allowed to take their
caps off, most classes having to wear their
caps until two weeks before the close of
the college year. ,

OVENS SPEAKS ON
RETAIL BUSINESS

Speaking on the posibilities of retail
business as a life calling, David Ovens,
general manager of Ivey’s Department
Store of Charlotte, declares that business
is in a stage of monentous transition from
private ownership to trusts controlled
by boards and not by individuals.

Mr. Ovens, who the juniors will re-
call as the main speakers of their fresh-
man banquet, stated that the law of the
good in business life. Business success
wild, the survival of the fittest, holds
is dependent on the man’s applicable
knowledge, code of cthics, and driving
power.

The talk was interspersed with rich
humor throughout. One of Mr. Oven’s
most forceful statements was that the
business field is not overcrowded. He
gave example after example of businesses
which could not be carried on on acount
of a lack of efficient men to head them.

ue Ge DEPUTATIONS _
GO TO CHARLOTTE

The Y. M. C. A. has tlfis past week
sent out two deputations and conducted
a Come Clean Campaign in the Char-
lotte public schools. Saturday morning
six men left Davidson for Banner Elk,
N. C.,, visiting McRae Institute where
they made several talks. This school is
under the supervision of L. K. Pritchett
of the class of ’28. The men making the
trip were R. O. Flinn, W. E. Hill, B.
F, Brown, J. D. McCall, G. H. Green,
and M. C. McQueen. They returned
to the campus Monday night.

W. H. Bailey went last Sunday to

and to members of the Y. M. C. A.

Much Improvement

Shown by Athletes

According to Capt. N. G. Pritchett the
winner of the Body Building contest, will
be announced Friday night at the Athletic
meeting to be held at Shearer Hall and
a loving cup will be presented to him.

It is interesting to note that six men
showed an inmprovement of over six
inches and of these six, four of them ex-
ceeded seven inches. Although all the
men have not been measured, the aver-
age. of those measured up to date is 5
5-8 inches. This exceeds, by far, all ex-
pectations of Capt. Pritchett. There are
only four men who did not slow an im-
provement of at Jeast four inches.

All of tne men who showed the largest
amount of improvement had taken, be-
sides the daily prescribed exerecises under
their own direction using the apparatus
obtainable in the gym.

Former Davidson Man
Big League Sensation

Pat Crawford, Baseball Star,
Making Good on Giants

The young sensation of the Giants,
Pat Crawford, first played baseball.at
Davidson College in 1920. Crawford
became captain and star of the David-
son team before his graduation in 1923.
While at Davidson Crawford was not
only a star in baseball but was one of
the best basketball players ever to
come to Davidson. He was leading

played at guard. Although he never
made: the varsity he was awarded a
service letter in football for his faith-
ful and conscientious attendance to all
the practices.

Crawford, besides his athletic
achievements, was very prominent, be-
ing president of the Y. M. C. A. his
last year at Davidson and connected
with many campus organizations.

While at Davidson Crawford played
in three different positions, right field,
center field, and first base. Since
playing professional baseball Crawford
has played at first and third base.

During his, first year in college Pat
fielded perfectly and held a batting
average of .282, which was next to the
leading hitter at Davidson that year.
For the other three years of his career
his fielding average was .990, and he
improved rapidly his batting average.

After his graduation he*coached for
a while, and, then -played baseball in
the Sally League, then in the Ameri-
can Association with Toledo, and is
now training with the New York
Giants. Crawford has been favorably
commented on by none other than
John McGraw himself.

Alumni Association

The Davidson Alumni located at Rich-
mond, Baltimore, New York, and Boston
are being addressed this week by Ernest
Milton, the executive secretary of the
General Alumni A¢sociation of Davidson
College. Over 250 Davidson men are*lo-
cated in or near these cities and all have
been invited to the dinner-meetings. The
alumni located in New Jersey, Connecti-
cut, and Rhode Island have also been in
vited to the meetings nearest them.

Alumni associations are already located
in Richmond, Baltimore and New York.
A meeting of the Philadelphia Alumni
was held last year but no association was
established. The Davidson men of Mas-
sachusetts are holding their first meet-
ing, and because so many of them are only
temporarily located in the state no at-
tempts will be made to establish a perma-
nent organization.

Dr. J. W. McConnell left Tuesday to
attend the New York meeting, having re-
ceived a special invitation from that body.
This meeting was held March 13th,
which is the Founder’s Day for Davidson
College.

PROSPECTS OF TRACK
ARE NOW PROMISING

Strong in High Jump and Vault
—Weak in’ Dashes and Hurdles

It is yet early in the season to esti-
mate the strength of the track team,
but the prospects are that Captain
Pritchett will develop a good team in
his first season’s work with the Wild-

}cat trackmen. Dumas and Gardner in

the high jump, and Brock, Bailey, and
Smith in the pole vault are doing well.
Currie and Whittle in the sprints, Jen-
nings in the 220-yard dash, Leftwich
and Regen in the shot-put and discus,
are all going strong and promise to be
point winners. It is hoped that a good
distance team can be picked from Neal,

Fresh track candidates are hard at
work each afternoon. As yet the pros-
pects for a strong team are dark, as
they are especially weak in the dashes,
pole vault, high jump, and hurdles, the
other positions being in fair shape.

Wilkinson, McAlpine, and

K. Curtis, millionaire Philadelphia news-
paper and magazine publisher, has pre-
sented a ‘Christmas present” of $500,000
to Temple, it was announced at the an-
nual Christmas party of the Temple Fac-
ulty Club.

The sum donated represents the largest
individual sum ever given Temple, thus
giving Mr. Curtis the title of largest sin-
gle contributor to this institution for
the third time. In 1921, Mr. Curtis pres-
ented $25,000 toward the erection of
Conwell Hall, while in 1926 Mr. Curtis
gave $100,000 in the Russell I. Con-
well Fund Campaign, heading the list of
subscribers in both these drives.

Mr. Curtis’ gift, according to President
Beury, will be used to start the erection
of the third or skyscraper unit of the
Temple building project at Broad street
and Montgomery avenue, as soon as plans
are drawn,
