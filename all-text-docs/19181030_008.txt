The DAVIDSONIAN, October 30, 1918

W. P. PARKER WRITES TO
DAVIDSON STUDENT BODY

The following letter has been receiv-
ed from the missionary, William P.
Parker. Mer. Parker is partially sup-
ported by funds collected at Davidson
College in behalf of his work.

He writes most encouraginuyly of his
work. Every Davidson man should be
deeply interested in his work and give it
his hearty support.

Pyengyang. Korea, Sept. 17, 1918.
Dear Fellow Workers:

We returned from anoual meeting the
first part of July, and stayed here till
August 1. At that time we went down
to Sorat Beach, a missionary resort some
ninety miles from here on the west coast
of Korea, and spent the month of Au-
gust there. We did not do much study-
ing as we found we were both pret,
well tired out. but spent most of the
month in gertings «a rest... Wee are al
three much benefited by Gur stay there.
and feel much better fitted for our fall
work. Mr. Vhwing, of China, con-
ducted a series of Bible studies at Sorai,
and these were a great help in our spirit-
ual life, and have been an inspiration tor
further study. We are so busy. with
other things that we do nat get the time
for Bible study that we ought to take,
and we have resolved to do more of 1
in the future than in the past, With
regular scheduled work it is impossible
to find one time to suit all, so our study
for the most part. must be private. Jers
has grown a great deal, and is fat ard
well as can he, except for a slight cold.
and her nother is in much hetter healtl.
than last year. God has certainly been
good to us, and we feel His presence
ever with us in our work here,

The Academy opened September 2,
and the College opened the next day, se
we have been very busy ever since our
return, Besides, We have had to move.
While at Sorat we received news that
Dr. Baird was to be married, and that
he would have to have his whole house
again, so we made plas to move over
to Mr, Bernheisel’s and do co-operative
housekeeping with him, As vou may
know, Mrs. Bernheisel. is at home
at present with her little daugh-
ter, on account of. the fatter’s health.
They hope to return next February, but
even after their return we plan to keep
onoat Mr. B.'s till our furlough next
June. Dr. Baird is expected back in a
month or so. He was.married in Au-
gust. “This move makes our sixth since
we've been married : and we cach moved
three times when single, so we are get-
ting used to the process. However, it
does not improve with time, and we will
be most happy when we can get a home
of our own, ‘Till that time we will prob-
ably have to move at least once. a year,
as now we get furloughed missionaries’
houses, Everybody has been very kind
in letting us go into their houses, but we
will appreciate getting settled all the
same,

A few boys have dropped out from
school, but the attendance is good, and
some new students have entered at this
time, tho as a rule we only receive boys
the first of the school year in April. Mr.
Mowry’s return has been greeted with
joy by all. He is a great favorite with
the Koreans and has won his way into
the hearts of them all. He will take
some of the burden of the work off of
some of the rest of us, tho Mr. Bolling
Reynolds’ removal to Kunsan has given
Mr. Mowry the work Reynolds carried
‘last year, Mr. Narahashi, our Japanese
science teacher, is back also, and seems
to be completely recovered. He could
not do any work last spring. During
the summer lost his second son from
tuberculosis, and this has been very hard
on him. We hoped to obtain two more
Japanese for teachers, but have not been
able to obtain them yet.

our new president, is doing some teach-
ing also.

And so we are all back into traces
again, and we are all glad to be there.
J wanted to write you early in the
month, but there has been much to do
and time has gone very fast, so even now
I will not try to write you more at
length, but will have to let this outline
of our work do instead of a long letter.
We hope that all of you have had a
good summer, and that God is blessing
you in your work. Pray for us continu-
ally, We know that you do pray for us,
and we do feel the effect of your prayers.
Remember the revival that we are long-
ing for thruour Korea, and pray that it
may begin avith us and spread thruout
the church. Mr. Buchman is expected
in Korea again this fall, and expects to
visit Pyengyang then. Pray for — the
meetings he may conduct here and at
other stations.

With all best wishes, [ am.

Youts in the service,
Wo, PARKER.
