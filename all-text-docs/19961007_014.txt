Kruse’s Cubby

In what is supposed to be
baseball’s most sacred season - the
postseason - the Baltimore Orioles’
second baseman Roberto Alomar
planted an unforgettable and
unexcusable stain on baseball’ s too-
often tarnished image.

In the final week of the regu-
lar season, the smooth-fielding,
heavy-hitting Alomar disputed a
strike call by hawking a loogey in
plate umpire John Hirschbeck’s
face.

After the game, Alomar added
insult to injury by saying
Hirschbeck had become “bitter”
ever since his 7-year-old son had
died from a rare brain disease.

Alomar’s punishment: a five-
game suspension at the beginning
of next season, allowing him to
play on the crucial final weekend
of the regular season and in the
playoffs before serving his time in
relatively meaningless April con-
tests.

Despicable. Pathetic. Spine-
less. Say hello to Major League
Baseball’s figurehead regime.

As muchas I loathe Cleveland
hothead Albert Belle, I will say this
in his defense: if he ever spat on an
umpire, MLB's powers-that-be
would suspend him for life on the
spot.

The same cannot be said for
Alomar, who has traditionally been
a good boy.

But track record can count for
only somuch. First offense murder
is still murder.

Alomar, free as a bird for now,
homered to clinch the American
League wildcard slot the day after.

The superstar, despite being
booed and jeered mercilessly by
Indians fans at Jacobs Field, then
came through in the clutch with a
two-out, game-tying single in the
top of the ninth against the Indians
in Saturday’s Divisional Series
battle and then smacked a game-
winning homer in the twelvth to
oust the defending A.L. kings from
the postseason.

Great player. Horrendous role
model.

In an attempt to cleanse his
suddenly rotten name, Alomar is-
sued a written apology last week
and donated $50,000 (actually, a
rather insignificant sum for a guy
making multi-millions) to the re-
search foundation for the disease
that killed Hirschbeck’s son.

Too little, too late.

Hirschbeck, whose nine-year-
old son also has the disorder, for-
mally forgave Alomar on Satur-
day.

But forgiving is not the same
as condoning. And Alomar’s ac-

He should not have been on
the field to get the Q’s into the

:} playoffs in the first place, and he
should not have been om the field to
b@rthe Tribe. Period.
‘| And the sad truth is that

‘Roberto Alomar, a perennial All-
Star who should be known for his
sure hands, superhuman range, and
popat the plate, will now be forever
remembered as the guy who spat

Women’s soccer pummels Mocs

Team leads conference despite three straight non-league OT heartbreakers

By WILL BRADSHAW
Sports Editor

It must have been like kissing
your brother. Three times the
women’s soccer team (5-7, 3-0)
took regional top ten teams to the
brink, and three times they fell in
overtime.

“Thave nothing but an incred-
ible amount of respect for them,”
UNC Greensboro coach Jack Po-
land said after his team dropped
the Wildcats 4-1 in overtime on
Wednesday. “They deserved to
win. They took us out of what we
wanted to do, and I hate like hell
for them to come out on the short
end.

“(Davidson’s) a good team.
Forty-eight hours ago they were in
overtime with (N.C.) State (a 1-0
loss). You just can’t play back to
back OT’s against teams with
athleticism. You’ve got to get it
done in regulation. If they had taken
advantage of their opportunities,

then they’dhave wins against State
(sixth in the region) and Greens-
boro (fifth).”

In Raleigh on Monday, the
Wildcats outshot the Wolfpack (6-
2-1) 14-13 in regulation play. But
State dominated the extra period,
outshooting Davidson 13-0 and
winning on Stephanie Sanders
rocket with just over four minutes
left in the extra period.

“We learned wecan compete,”
defender Kelly Schmidt said, “but
we don’t want to just compete any-
more. We want to win and we can.
We know we can.”

The team came home Wednes-
day to battle UNCG (8-2). In the
29th minute of play, Amy Kanoff
wrapped a corner around the front
post. Spartan goalkeeper Paula
Domitrovits mishandled it, and the
ball dropped in for a 1-0 Wildcat
lead.

It looked like Davidson was

. going to hold on for the win, but

Spartan striker Ali Lord had other

ideas. Off a pass from Raila
Maisonlahti in the 75th minute,
she dribbled a defender, cut back
in a crowd at the six, and knotted
the score at one with a bullet past
Wildcat keeper Allison Noznesky.
In the 113th minute, Kim
Rosenberg deflected Joy Scott’s
shot slipping it by Noznesky.
Thirty seconds later, Lord got be-
hind the Wildcat defense and fin-
ished her second goal of the night.
Katie Kantanen completed the
scoring inthe 117th minute, punch-
ing the ball into an open net after
Melissa Moser and Noznesky col-
lided chasing down a loose ball.
“We’ve played two top 25
teams into overtime in three days.

I want to be in that position. But in -

neither case does the result show
the play inregulation,” coach Kevin
Hundley said after the Greensboro
game. “We must learn whatit takes
to step up and win a game like this.

“One of our goals was to beat
atop 25 team, and we struggled the

first two (Clemson and Maryland,
both 4-1 defeats) because we fell
behind. We learned from that, and
we’ve improved since then, but to
win at that level you’ve got to do
something else. You’ ve got to score
some goals,” he stated.

They traveled to Georgia (7-
3, eighth in the region) on Friday
for another tough game. Again the
Wildcats were unable to pull off
the upset falling 1-0 in overtime.

“Against Georgia, as opposed
to the other two where we were
unlucky not to have won, we de-
fended the whole game. Allie
(Noznesky) had one of her best
games ever to keep us at 0,”
Hundley said. .

But Davidson took out their
frustration on visiting conference
foe Tennessee-Chatanooga (2-8,
0-4) on Sunday, outshooting the
Mocassins 43-0 and winning 6-0.

“Our focus turns to confer-
ence now. We want to win,”
Hundley said. “It’s like I told the
team before the game, this could
be nothing but a win. We had to
win. Whether it was ugly or a work
of art, whether it was by one goal
or ten”

Ginny Dye started the scoring
for the Wildcats, getting her fourth
game-winner in the 11th minute.
She added another goal in the 31st
minute. Leila Wormuth (45th
minute), Kelly Rennick (52nd),
Rhina Roberts (80th), and Jennifer
Scott (83rd) scored the other goals.

“We feel confident that we
can go for all wins after this,” Rob-
erts said after the UTC game.
“We're really focusing on confer-
ence play right now.”

“The thing I got out of these
games is that I have no question of
our character,” Hundley said of his
team. “To come back and play
each game at the same level even
after the disappointment is a huge
plus, and it’s not something you
know until you get into battle.

“In Georgia’s program it said
‘Davidson, who plays everyone
tough.’ That’s still true. We’re not
going to roll over for you even if
we get down, and that’s all I can
ask. Hopefully we’ll get some
breaks and win one of these
games,” he added.

They’ ll get another chance on
Wednesday when Mecklenburg
County rival UNC Charlotte comes
to Richardson Field.

Pastel challenges best at the ITA Clay Court Tourney

By Kerry Bropuy

Junior Jon Pastel, last year's
Southern Conference tennis player
of the year, challenged the nation’s
top college players at the ITA Na-
tional Clay Court Tournament
Sept. 14-29 in Baltimore.

Pastel’s outstanding perfor-
mance in the tournament began
when he beat Samford's Peter Calitz
in three sets. His winning streak
continued as he defeated UNC's

Tony Thomas in another grueling
three-set victory.

Pastel’s next challenge was
Illinois' Cary Franklin, whom he
topped in straight sets. A fourth-
round win took him into the main
draw of the ITA tournament.

Pastel’s success continued in
the main draw when he bettered
Notre Dame's Jakub Petrowski.

His run cametoan end against
a Mississippi St. player from
France, who proceeded to the tour-
nament finals.

Pastel’s presence in the main
draw placed him among the top 16
collegiate clay court players in the
tournament. His showing capped
off an exciting summer during
which he beat top players from

~ Harvard, Dartmouth, Colgate, -

Princeton and Florida St. at the
ITA tournament held in Princeton,
NJ. .
According to fall results, Pas-
tel ranks 19th in the region, but his
standing has mostly likely im-
proved to as high as tenth.

“I think the combination of
his summer ‘experience and this
recent tournament put him in con-
tention for an outstanding 1996 |
season,” said head men's tennis
coach Jeff Frank.

Indeed, Pastel susied some

_ tough three-set matches against the

nation'selite. Pastel’s stamina was
even more impressive than his no-
table wins, considering he suffered
from Patellar Tendinitis through-
out the event.
