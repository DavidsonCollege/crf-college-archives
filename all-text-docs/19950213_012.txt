Looking back at 1994

The country music year in review

One year ago last week, I
pulled ona brand new pair of boots,
sat down in front of this same com-
puter, and tried to give you a list of
songs to remember in 1993. Well,
1994 just rolled by, and here I am
again, with the same boots (a little
less shiny), staring at the same
blinding screen.

So, what has Nashvegas
granted us this year? Did Radney
Foster bring us another “Easier
Said Than Done?” Did Clint Black
belt out another “State of Mind?”
Well, no, not this year. My heroes
of 1993 took a back seat to both

veterans and maverick newcomers
to the country scene.
1. Garth Brooks, “Callin’ Baton
Rouge”

At the top of the list this year
sits, not surprisingly, Garth Brooks.

This is not the Garth of cross-genre
musical fame. This is the Garth of
“Cowboy Bill” and “Friends in
Low Places.” In ‘Callin’ Baton
Rouge,” I hear Garth singing as
Garth should. He took on the origi-
nal singers, songwriters, and musi-
cians of New Grass Revival (in-
cluding Bela Fleck on banjo) and
created the most driving, intense
country song of 1994. I can’t be-
lieve I used to wonder why Garth
turns a dime.

2. David Ball, “When the Thought
of You Catches up with Me”

A woman once broke David
Ball’s heart. He once lost months,
maybe years, crying over her. He
nearly lost himself in a river of
depression — but at least he wrote
a great song about it. Congratula-
tions to one of the year’s most

promising newcomers.
3. Diamond Rio, “Love a Little
Stronger”

Diamond Rio once again so-
lidified their position as the best
band in the new country move-
ment with “Love a Little Stron-
ger,” as well as their recent hit,
“Night is Falling in my Heart.”
Both songs betray fantastic musi-
cianship and incredible vocal ar-
rangements.

4. Lyle Lovett, “Sonja”

Though Lyle stands on the
edge of country music, he still holds
a great place in my heart. As long
as a goofy lookin’ Texancan marry
Julia Roberts, hope still exists for
me. Every song on / Love Every-
body could make this list, but
“Sonja” stands out even on an al-
bum full of masterpieces. If touch-

ing lyrics and subtle (and often
shameless) humor mark a great
songwriter, then Lyle stands head,
hair, and shoulders above the rest.
5. Patty Loveless, “Here I Am”

Patty once again graces my
list, becoming the only repeat of-
fender this year. She matches
1993’s touching ballad, “Holding
onto Nothing but the Wheel,” with
this year’s equally moving “Here I
Am.” Patty’s honest, beautiful
voice, tasteful performances, and
great songwriters maintain her po-
sition (in my mind at least) as the
reigning queen of country.

As for the upcoming year,
expect great things from newcomer
George Ducas. His latest release,
“Lipstick Promises,” is steadily
climbing the charts. Also, expect
Clint Black to begin a reassess-

ment of his music. He’s been
slowly slipping into mediocrity
with each album, but he’s not dead
yet.

When Hemingway saw his
career collapsing around him, he
mustered every fiber of talent and
wrote “The Old Man and the Sea.”
Let’s hope Clint can follow suit.

Enjoy the rest of the year and
“keep it between the lines.”
