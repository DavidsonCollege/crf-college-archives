EDIPFORIAL

Owing to various reasons this will be
the last issue of the Davidsonian till
after Christmas. ‘Vhe staff would gladly
get out another issue, provided they were
excused from exams; but the faculty fails
to look at it from the same point of view,
so being human, we will have to undergo
the ordeal also,

“The staff wishes the best of luck to
every man during the exams week after
next, and hopes every one will get thru
safely. We also wish a very Merry
Christmas arid a Happy ‘New Year to
every one of our readers. May you have
the happiest vacation ever.

It's hard to lose a game, especially a
Thanksgiving game, but we believe Da-
vidson can take a defeat with as good a
spirit as the next oné. Our abbreviated
season of four games has done credit to
the institution, as the follosving scores
show:

Davidson, 20; W. and L., o.

Davidson, 14; Carolina, 7.

Davidson, 0; Remounters, 0.

Davidson, o; Clemson, 7.

‘Totals: Davidson, 34; Opponents, 14.

Prospects are always uncertain, so far
ahead, but we are confident that the fall
of 1919 will prove to be one of David-
son's best.

We take this opportunity to express

the greetings of the student body to
“Bob” Miles, our new “Y" secretary.
We're behind you, Mr. Miles, and hope
vour stay will be a pleasant one.

A REGULAR NUSINESS COURSE.

Outsiders have inquired as to whether
Davidson has any elementary business
course. such as bookkeeping or account-
ing, and have commented upon the fact
that such a course is invaluable to a
young fellow .on leaving college. The
present war time accounting course has
nroeved to be as popular as any on the
Hill. and is a subject which every young
man should have some knowledge of.

We strongly advocate that such a
course should be inserted into the regular
college curriculum.
whether it is wise to leave all such prac-
tical subjects to the business schools, as
the average college man never attends
such institutions. An elementary course

It is a question)

The DAVIDSONIAN, December 4, 1918

in accounting will not necessarily. make RECEPTION GIVEN IN HONOR

Davidson less a literary college, and the
advantages obtained from such a valu-
able subject more than offset the depart-
ure from the general run of literary sub-
jects.

Parents have wanted such a course
taught as well as the students. If a man
is taught how to take care of his prop-
erty, he has been taught something worth
while. We believe the whole student
body joins with us in requesting this, and
we hope the authorities will consider se-
riously the continuing of accounting in
the regular curriculum.

TILE NHAR FUTURE.

[t seems to be a custom in the army
never to know what may turn up in the
immediate future. ‘That has certainly
been our fix for the past two montis,
But thru all the uncertainty no one can
deny that the §. A. ‘°P. C. has on the
whole been of immense value not only to
the students, but to the college itself.

During these last days and those im-
mediately following the mustering out,
there will be a natural tendency toward
demoralization and reaction, which will

‘prove a menage to every college in the

country. ualess the old men take some
definite stand for law and order. Wed-
nesday the proposition was put squarely
before the upper classes, and it rests pri-
marily with them as to what will be the
moral status of the student body this
pring. :

A man is his own keeper, to a certain
extent, physically, mentally, and morally,
but when he flies off at a tangent at the
raising of every restriction, he shows a
pitiful lack of common sense, which can-
not help but result in regrets. Fellows.
for the love you have for old Davidson,
look at the situation in an open state of
mind and give it your honest thought.
We know if this is done that nothing
will go wrong in the student body this
year.

As to returning to college in’ the
spring, all we ask is that every man look
at it in a common sense point of view.
We don't appeal to anyone to come to
college so as to be a leader of men. A
college education may help a man to be

such, but will not necessarily make him

one, as many of the qualities of leader
ship are inborn. “This old world would
be in a bad way if it had to depend on
some college graduates for leadership.
But we appeal to your common sense.
Just a look will show that any man in any
profession today without a college educa-
tien is severely handicapped. As some
one has said, a greater premium is placed
upon education new than in any time in
the country’s history. We possibly can't
realize it now, but have you ever thought
why it is that fathers without much edu-
cation will work themselves to death ‘to
send their boys to college? We wish
every man would read the article appear-
ing in the Forum by Dr. Smith of W.
and L. Fellows, it's worth your while
to think this all over carefully.

NOTICE.

Your subscriptions to the United War
Work Fund will be received by Mr.
Jackson in his office during the specified
hour. Do your best.

A Yankee paper gets this one off on
the Goober State: “A soldier from
the “Cracker” section of Georgia, after
secing the first movie ina Y. M. C. A.
hut, remarked to a friend, “Mighty fine
picture; but 1 was so blamed fur back
I couldn't hear a word they said !"—Ex.

A certain British soldier's letter runs
thus: “I am sorry I can not tell you
where I am, because .I am -not allowed
to say. But I venture to state that I am
not where I was, but where I was before
T left here to go where I have just come
from.”—Punch.

OF DR. RICHARDS.

On ‘Thanksgiving evening avery
pleasant, informal reception was given
in the Library building by the Davidson
congregation, in honor of Dr. Richards’
tenth anniversary with the Davidson
church and in recognition of his useful
service to the community in this ten
years’ interim. Preparations for the re-
ception were carried out in secrecy, and
the whole occasion was made a pleasant
surprise for Dr. Richards, A purse of
$200 in gold, with an increase in salary,
was presented him late ‘Thanksgiving
afternoon. At the sitne time the news
of the reception was “broken” to him.

The reception was niarked by a large
attendance. Vhe Library had been beati-
tifully decorated within by Miss Shaw
with the national colors and cut flowers,
beautiful chrysanthemums, roses, and
narcissus. Upon entering one passed
down the receiving line of members of
the Church Session and their wives.
After greetings were passed by all, Dr.
Martin, master of ceremonies, took
charge. An itteresting program of talks.
lasting over an hour, followed.

Dr. Martin first read a leter from Dr.
Shearer, who was unable to be present.
Mr. Knox, senior member of the Ses-
sion, gave a prolonged narration of Dr.
Richards’ work as pastor of the David-
son Church. He was followed by Dr.
Harding, who told of Dr. Richards’ suc-
cessful preaching. Dr. Grey then read
a number of statistics, describing the
marked increase in contributions and ad-
ditions to the church under Dr. Rich-
ards’ pastorate. “Chere have been 296
additions, through fetter and profession,
in this period of ten years; but, owing to
Davidson's unstable population, the pres-
ent membership does not show this great
increase.
has been a. like rise.

Last on the program of the evening
was a tuk by Mr. Jackson on the
growth of the Sunday school.

After the speeches the reception as-
sumed the form of a social. Refresh-
ments of ice cream and cake made by the
good ladies of the congregation, were
served. ‘The occasion was greatly en-
joyed by all present, and has afforded a
new stimulus to the congregation.

A LETTER FROM CAPT. J. C.
HARPER.

Washington and Lee University,
Students Army Training Corps,
Lexington, Va., Dec. 22, 1918.
Editor of the Davidsonian,
Davidson, N.C,
Dear Sir:

In the latest number of the David-
sonian just received, |- notice on page
three a tew lines entitled ‘When Kaiser
Bill) Receives,” the subject matter of
which is to the effect that when General
Pershing gets to Berlin, his first remark
will be. “Bill, we are here.” We up
here have a different opinion. Our idea
is that he will say, “Now we are here,
present your Bill.”

Best wishes and good luck to all at
Davidson and our heartiest congratula-
tions on this year's football record. 1
would have deserted the army and gone
to Winston to have seen the game. 1
never missed a single Davidson-Carolina
football game from the time I was a
freshman until the war took such a
claim on my time, that my little excur-
sions were limited.

Loyally yours,
James C. Harper, ‘15.
