Ralphy,”
didn’t wanna weke up the fellow
lecturin’ to us. “there aren *t any
heroes anymore."

“Damn right,”’ he said. “Princess
Caroline’s — married, Elvis air't

shakin, 'n’ Groucho isn’t slouching
around. ananen: ya see that girl
over there? Ringer for Fairah Dripler-
Minor. Cool, huh?”’

“That's exactly my point. All you
can think of are media people, images.
Nobody. you can reach out and grab.
No real flesh and blood heroes.’’

We were talkin pretty loud and the
fem next to us in the quiana blouse
was givin us evil looks, thinkin mebbe
the nois’d prompt the fellow to ask a
question in our direction, so we
clammed up and I mulled it awhile
while doodlin pale blue dunes and
spent-wing coachmen cross the foppa
my notes.

Between the demise of the extended
family and the rise of the tube, local
heroes had been swallowed up. Nu-
clear families don’t allow for black
sheep uncles that fish all weekend,
drink and whore all night and write
for a brash little paper in the off
hours. There was room for his type in
the big family that lived in the same
town; room, tolerance, respect, and
love. But everybody's gotta be re-
spectable and hardworking in a
middle class nuclear family and how
would TV package such a fellow
anyway? No room for rascals here.

Let’s take time to consider the hall.
It’s a good institution for many
students (Cathy Landis, The David-
sonian, Volume LX VII, Number 3, p.
4), but let’s ask some fundamental
questions. If virtue is knowledge, can
be virtue be taught? Why are Hostess
Twinkies cream-filled? For that mat-
ter, what is so sacred about horizontal
halls?

We would like to commend the
editor for her intellectual investi-
gation of the “Freshman Hall Con-
cept,’ but implore her to look deeper.
As she so astutely observed, ‘‘The
security that the hall provides...be-
comes a security blanket in which
students turn (sic) to avoid challenge
and stimulation.’’ Obviously inse-
curity leads to growth. Why not
foster growth by eliminating horizon-
tal halls?

Vertical halls, as an alternative
would nurture that insecurity for
which we grope. Imagine stepping out
of your room into a 23-story free-fall
and landing at the other end of the
hall. Why stop there? We could

construct swinging halls; you would .

guy who's on thé damn tube? And if
he’s on the tube he'll end up on the
mags, starin out atcha as you go
through the supermarket lines. Rogue
uncles, eccentric aunts, devoted ma's
and butt bustin’ pa’s don't have a
snowball's chance in hell. not with

Sports figures used to be safe, but

floor, the walls or the ceiling. Mobile
halls: the ultimate in insecurity. You
would never know where your hall
might be when you return from class.
For the highly motivated student,
hardened criminals could be chosen
for hall counselors, insecurity phones
installed, exploding johns designed.
We could release sharks at the
Freshman Regatta, plant landmines
in the outdoor classroom, electrify
handrails, have our homecoming
theme based on a Stalin purge or
annually sacrifice a virgin from the
Freshman Class to the volcano god.
Fortunately, being a progressive
institution, Davidson is already bles-
sed with three maximum insecurity
devices. Our infirmary and our police

force do their utmost to make us feel
insecure, and how much more could
ARA Food Services do? —

We can at least make options
available. By forcing freshmen to
decide which alternative they want
before they even understand their
choices, we are effectively instilling
the kind of insecurity needed. to
cultivate unimpeded growth.

Too long has the horizontal hall
gone without question; water won't
even drain off after water fights. We
need to conduct a thorough evalu-
ation to make sure we establish a
system of greatest value to the entire
college community.

Wake up freshmen |!

To the Editor:

Iam. writing this letter to address
the freshman class. Why did the
meeting called by SGA President
Thom Young this past Tuesday for all
freshmen have only. 40 students out of
the class of 40Q.attend? Why was
freshman participation in the Patter-
son Court open houses on Monday
somewhat sparse? Why don’t more
freshmen go to the discos and band
parties on campus?

As an upperclassman, I sense the
lack of freshman involvement is
because freshmen are studying during
many of these activities. I understand
that Davidson's workload is deman-
ding and that as freshmen you wish to
establish youselves academically, and
this is admirable.

But I would like to suggest to you
that studying all the time is not the
best way to achieve academic success
at Davidson. Indeed, the more you
get involved in other activities, the
better you will do in you studies. If
you do nothing but study, it is bound
to affect you emotionally, physically

~and socially. And as you are affected

detrimentally in these areas, your
studies will be hurt as well. All your
frustrations will be bottled up inside
you with no way to-let them out.

But if you get involved in various
fun and interesting activities, you will
have a chance to spend your excess
energy, to express yourself, to vent
your frustrations and to divert your-
self from purely academic pursuits.

Then, with a clearer mind and a better |
disposition you will be able to study
better.

Naturally, involvement will leave
you with less time to study, but I
suggest that this, too, may be
beneficial. If you know that you have
all day and night‘to study, it is much
easier to waste small bits of time
doing nothing. This loss of time is
unnecessary. But if you must sche-
dule studies around various activities
you will use your study time more
efficiently. You'll learn.to do more
work in less time and thereby will
become more effective students, aca-
demically and otherwise.

So get involved, freshman. class,
and it will help you with your studies.
And at the same time your Davidson
experience will be much more plea-
Sant, since you will be living as
well-rounded, whole person.
