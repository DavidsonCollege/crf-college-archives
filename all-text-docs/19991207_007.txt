What is health? Is health the same as happi-
ness? When we speak of someone being healthy,
do we mean simply that their bodies are strong and
stable and their minds balanced?

The answers to these question might strike us
as obvious. Or the asking of these questions might
seem absurd. Health is having-a body that’s
working and a
mind that’s bal-

piness means and leave public discourse on the
subject to those with nothing else to do?

My answer, inadequate though it may be, is
that these questions are neither usless nor left only
to the individual to answer. -They aren't useless
because individuals do not exist in isolation from
one another. Your health and happiness are not
your own,

This theme has run through most, if not all, of
the efforts that the Health Advisors have made this

semester. We may

These answers may be satisfying. But they're
not sufficient, because though they may illustrate
one idea of health, they don’t cover all ideas of
-health. Nowhere, in either the questions asked or
the answers given, was any notion of the soul
mentioned. For someone who believes in the
existence of a soul, perhaps due to religious con-
viction, these answers would be far from satisfy-
ing. They might add a third element to the
formlulation of health, saying, “I’m health when
my body is working and my mind is balanced and
my soul is good.” Or they might abandon the body
and the mind as the place of health, choosing
instead to say that it is in the soul that healthiness
alone lies. These notions of health might affect
conceptions of happiness.

Does the fact that there are varied opinions as
to the nature of health and happinéss mean that
asking such questions is useless? Should one
simply discover for onesself what health and hap-

I’m speaking about this issue because I see all
too often today that we know that we live in a
community, but we say, “Ill pursue my happiness
and you pursue yours and all will work out.”
In the ancient world victims of leprosy were
exiled, a practice illustrated in the novel Ben Hur.

This is just one example of the marginilization of

the “unhealthy” by society. It may be tempting to
say that this practice is far behind us--and yet, one
could argue that the same dynamic still does oper-
ate on many different fronts. We still see hostile
views towards AIDS victims, something which
the AIDS awareness demonstratio n was intended
to combat.

Maybe the truth is that we are all unhealthy in
our ways. Maybe, just maybe, we’re here to help
each other through the days that are dark and the
problems that besiege us.

Theatre Department pre-
sents an evening of Brecht

Quietly, the three wives sit at their tables,
combs in hands. Quietly they brush their hair,
Stare into space, looks of either emotional resigna-
tion or deep sadness on their faces. Clothed in
black dresses, quietly they sit.

This setting greeted the audience as it filed
into the Black Box Theatre for An Evening of.
Berthold Brecht. The night was filled with two
One acts by the German playwright directed by
professor Sharon Green.

The first one act performed was “The Jewish
Wife.” The dynamics of the act are unsettling.
Three women, who are and aren’t the same woman,
sit at individual tables and perform similar actions
and say similar things. What is the story in “The

Jewish Wife?” Though the play isn’t staged in a
convential manner, it seems that it tells the story of
a husband and wife living in Nazi Germany. The
wife is Jewish, the husband, it seems, isn’t. The
husband was played by Bill Neville, while the
three wives were Kristine Grayson, Rosalie
Esteves, and Molly Shaw. Brecht’s construction
of “The Jewish Wife” is unconvential, but how-
ever you look at it, the performances by Bill,
Kristine, Rosalie, and Molly were nothing but
good.

The second one act was somewhat more
convential. Entitled “The Informer,” it details the
anxiety of a husband and wife (Rosalie Esteves
and Ed Ellington) who are worried that their son
(Bill Neville) or their maid (Rachel Stoddard) will
“inform” on them. While their personal drama
plays out in their living room, the audience sees
