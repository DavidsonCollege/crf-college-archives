‘WE'LL DQ ALL RIGHT’
Brickels Hits Trail
For Top Prospects

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Sports Writer

While head basketball
coach Larry Brown is still
playing for thes professional
Oakland Oaks in the Amer-
ican Basketball Association
playoffs, assistant coach Bo
Brickels is carrying out the
hectic task of recruiting.

Brickels left Tuesday on a

- trip to Indiana. while Brown
“has been recruiting in Cali-
fornia, wit; planned trips to
Utah and Idaho. The coaches
have been. concentrating on
the Mid-West areas and Cal-
ifornia.

In_ Indiana, particularly.
many basketball prospects
are involved in spring sports

and are unable to visit cam-
puses. Brickels, therefore, is
making a. special effort to
personally see these pros
pects.

Brickels compared the pro-
blem of personal contact to
fraternity rush procedures.
As ai recruiter, ne must
break the barrier between
himself as a coach and the
recruit as a player. Once the
barrier is broken, then he can
cornmunicate on a personal
level with the player.

As to the type of prospects
Brickels is, seeking, he said
that “quickness is the first
quality we look for. We feel
that we can teach him de-
fense and teamwork once hr

Davidson Signs
Another Brown

Davidson students r :y be seeing a little Brown--

along with the Wildcat red for the next few seasons,
both on the bench and the court.

Head basketball coach Larry Brown, after being

in his new position for less than a week and spending .

less than a day in his campus office, announced last
week that Ray Brown Jr., a 5-10, 155-pound guard
from New Orleans, has signed a grant-in-aid to play

basketball for Davidson.

“I can’t tell you how happy !
announcement,” Coach Brown said. “Ray

am to make this
is a solid

college prospect despite his height, and we feel that
he'll make a fine college guard.” ;

Brown’s choice of Davidson over ‘the many other
schools that recruited him was simply a case of the
Wildcats claiming one of their own. Brown's’ father,
Ray Sr., served as backfield coach in football and
freshman basketball coach for Davidson from 1948

to 1951.

“Ray’s a very fine basketball player,” said Bo
Brickels, Davidson’s new assistant coach. Brickels,
who had the distinction of recruiting Brown for two
schools, Rice and Davidson, said that Brown is “like

an extra coach on the
he’s coming to Davidson.

playing floor. Fm glad that

Among the many schools that contacted and re-
cruited Brown were Marquette, North Carolina, Vir-
ginia, Tulane, Vanderbilt, Rice and Texas.

Brown starred at Newman High School in New
Orleans, a school with a senior class of only 72 that
went to the Louisiana state play-offs with a 26-4 re-
cord last season, as Brown captained the team.

Averaging 22.5 points a game and playing flaw- -

lessly from the floor, Brown was named to the first
team all-district and first team all-state squads this
past year. As a junior he averaged 18.2 a contest and

made second team all-state.

In addition, Brown was named as the district’s
most valuable player this past year.

Bomber Aiming At Hundredth Win
As Freshman Hurling Staff Shines

Coach Tom Stevens’ Da-
vidson baseball team still has
eight regular season games
left to play, and already the

" Wildcats have won as many

games as in both the past
two seasons.

The batsmen, who present-
ly stand at 6-12-1 going into
today's doubleheader at the
Citadel, have also scored
more runs this year then
in either of the last two
seasons.

Stevens, often referred to
as “the Bomber’ by his
players and associates. feels
that the season has already
been somewhat of a success.
“We'e already won some
good games, and should have
won several other close ones.
We could easily have a win-
ning record now if we'd have
gotten the breaks.”

“This team is much im-
proved over the last few
Davidson baseball teams,”
Stevens said. ‘We're hitting
better, and our pitching is
coming along real well. For
a team as young as Ours,
we're doing a good job.”

Young is the word to des-
cribe the Wildcat stars so far
this season. The pitching
staff alone bears this out, as
all of the victories have been
recorded by either freshmen
or a sophomore, Wade Shep-
herd.

The freshmen moundsmen
have been especially advan-
tageous to the baseball im-
provement. Rick Pipan, Mar-
shall Case and Mike Frye
have combined for five of the
team’s six victories, and
have added some hitting as
well.

Case, for instance, knock-
ed in the winning run against
East Carolina last Saturday
while Pipan was limiting

the Pirates to just seven hits.

Another freshman star has
been catcher .Harold Wilker-
son. Wilkerson, .although in a
batting slump, has done an
excellent defensive job and
has handled the young pitch-
ing corps like a veteran, ac-
cording to Stevens.

Gordon Slade continues as
the leading batsman. still
hitting around .400. Bob
Meadows leads the team in
runs batted in with 11, while
Slade and Case have the only
Wildcat home runs.

gets here.”

Brickels declined to name
players in whom he {is inter-
ested, since the announce-
ment might jeopatdize the
players. However, he is look-
ing for a goed big man. and
he feels confident that he
will be able to field a balanc-
ed group of recruits.

In meeting the challenge
of recruiting. Brickels said
that it is “hard to be opti-
mistic, but it’s also hard
to be pessimistic." He feals
that the staff fs ‘making pro-
gress cach day. and that Dav
idson’s basketball. program is
sull “headed in the right di-
rection.”

Dr..Tom Scott. Davidson's
athletic director; echoed Bric-
kels in saying that a lot of
progress is being made. Ac
cording to Scott. many of
the big prospects are still on
the line, and Davidson has
as good a chance as any
body to get them.

“A lot of the better boys
won't sign unti) May.” Scott
pointed out. ‘‘They're con-
sidering a lot of colleges,
and have yet to make a de-
finite decision. There are
still an awful lot-of great col-
lege prospects left."

Scott also pointed out that
Steve Kirley, Brian Adrian
and Eric Minkin all were
late signees, not deciding
to attend Davidson until al.
most after the school year
was over. Minkin didn’t sign
with the Wildcats until well
into the summer.

“We might be a little bit
in back of some of the othe:
colleges, but we've made ex-
cellent progress," Scott con-
tinued. ‘‘We've gotten a very
favorable response from high
school prospects since the
coaches were named."

According to Scott. a num-
ber of good high schoo! pros-
pects will be visiting the
campus in coming weeks.
For example, four of ‘the nu-
tion’s best prep stars will
visit Davidson tomorrow.

“Despite the obstacles that
we had against us. I think
that we're going to do all
right."" Brickels said. ‘*With
a man like Larry Brown as
head coach. a kid is bound
to give us a second look.”’

sion of the conference. How-
ever, a sweep of the double-
header would put the Wild-
cats in third ahead of the
Bulldogs.

Also, two wins would leave
Stevens just one victory short
of his hundreth win at Da-
vidson. “I would like to get
there, and I think that this
team can do it,"" Stevens
said.

The difference between the

‘team this year and last is

obvious in the _ statistics.

‘Mr. Brains’ Sparkles,
Shows How It’s Done

By RUSS MERRITT

If Larry Brown can be as
successful with Davidson bas-
ketball as he has been with
the Oakland Oaks of the pro-
fessional American Basket-
ball Association, the Wildcats
may be well headed toward
another championship.

Brown, who last season
Jed Oakland to the league
finals with his floor play and
timely scoring. is once again
pacing his squad in the ABA
play. offs.

The Oaks won. the regular
season championship behind
the teadership of Browh, the
team captain. Brown broke.

the league record, which he
himself set last season, for
assists, passing off to teem-
mates for points 546 times
this year for an average of
7.1 a game.

On a team featuring the
likes of Rick Barry and
Doug Moe, Brown came in-
to the play-offs this year
not known as a prolific scor-
er. having finished fifth in

average. However. in the
seven-game scries with New
Orleans this week. Brown

PE’s Pull Softball Upset

By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor

If anyone heard a couple
of booms recently around
IMAC circles, he shouldn't be
alarmed. It was nothing more
than two of the year's big-
gest upsets.

The Pikas provided the
shocker in volleyball, knock-
ing off the favored Delts to
take the IMAC crown with
an undefeated record, while
the SPEs upset the softball
pre-season picks, the heavy-
hitting Kappa Sigs.

The volleyball competition
was a two team race from
the beginning. as the Pikas
and Delts were the only un-
defeated teams after the
first week of games.

They finally met head-on

above .200.

Also. the improvement in
the pitching records is note-
worthy. This season has seen
all five pitchers with earned
‘run averages lower than
5.00. while last season only
two hurlers were below that
mark. Also, this year’s ver-
sion of the Wildcat pitching
staff has already recorded
more strikeouts than the
pitchers last season.

The most important part of
the schedule is stil] ahead
for Davidson as the Wildcats
have yet to play six more
conference games, including
those today. A win in each
of these games would place
Davidson in éxcellent posi-
tion to advance into the con-
ference play-offs.

Besides the conference con-
tests, the Wildcats are sched.
uled to play Belmont Abbey.
a squad which beat Florida
and lost earlier in the sea-
son. to Davidson, and ACC-
leading Clemson.

In games this past week,
the Wildcats became the only
conference team to biemish
the otherwise perfect league
record of the Furman Pala-
dins. After losing in the first
game of a doubleheader on
the Davidson field by 9-1,
the Wildcats held on for a
§-§ tie in a game called for
darkness after eight innings.

In that doubleheader, the
Wildcats had a scare when
Case, the pitching ace so
far this year, was hit in the
arm while at bat. However,
according to Case, ‘“‘my arm's
real sore, but I don’t think
that anything is broken. I'll
be able to pitch again soon.”

The Bomber has already
seen a great deal during his
13 seasons with Davidson.
Perhaps this year he'll see
his hundreth win.

last Wednesday afternoon.
the Delts being 10-0 and the
Pikas 9-0 at the time of the
confrontation. :

The Pikas beat the Dehs
two games to none, 15-12
and 15-10, and differences
in) the personnel and manner
o- play of the two teams
makes analysis of the out-
eome very interesting.

The Delts featured the
best: set of spikers in the
league in Tony Orsbon, Way-
ne Hickel, and Rocky Cross-
white.- On the surface it ap-
pears . that this strength
would have been enough to
win.

However, the real secret to
the victory lay in two other
factors, the number of men
played and the set-up men.
The Pikas proved that the
team with the best set-up
men wins the championship.
Fred Kastner, Bill Pierce,
Tom Poston and especially
Fred Lowrance were consis-
tent in their set-ups and al-
lowed the Pika spikers, Joe
Lansinger. Tom  Hendren,
and Mark Affeldt, although
Jess spectacular than the
Delts. to spike with authority.

The Delt set-up men were
inconsistent, nullifying the
power of their spikers. In
the second game the Delts
lost when they removed their
best set-up man, Cliff Pat-
erson, and the Pikas prompt-
ly reeled off seven straight
points, Patterson was rein-
serted, but it was too late.

The other factor in the
Pika victory was that they
played eight men compared
to.the Delts' six. The extra
men facilitated in the saving
of spikes, at which Billy
Pierce did a fantastic job.
There were often holes in
the Delt defense because of
their use of only six players.

Behind the Pikas and Delts
in the final finish came the
Sigma Chis, the Sigma Nus
and Kappa Sigs, all with
8-4 records.

Pete Norton was the out-
standing spiker for the Ma-
chis. with help from Jerry
Krolt and Jeff Pflugner.
Herb Clegg was the best of
their set-up men.

The Nus relied mainly on
tenacity and ability to keep
the ball in play. They play-
ed nine men and were very
good at picking up spikes.
Steve Hayes and Calvin Mu--
phy provided adequate spik-
ing. but the Nus were weak
on set-ups.

The Sigs main problem
was also set-ups. Doug Cook,
Bill. McKensie, Mike Kelly,
and Mike O'Neill were: all
good spikers, but there was
no one to set them up con.
sistently.

It was rumored before. the
softball season began that
SPE pitching ace Bob Dun.
ham would be hampered by
the slow pitch rule. However.
Dunham, the only fast-pitch
hurler of any repute on cam-
pus, silenced the Sig guns
with the aid of a strong wind
from centerfield. on just
five hits as the SPEs won a
squeaker, 3-2. Craig Garner
scored the winning run.

The win threw the SPEs
into the midst of the title
picture along with the usually
powerful Delts and the sur-
prising ATOs. The Delts
after yesterday's games had
won three contests, scoring
a total of 50 runs, while the
ATOs had also won three,
including two one-run wins.

The Sigs. despite their loss
to the. SPEs. won three also,
including a 15-0 wallopping
of the Nus.

The KAs won two of three
games. while the Machis
took both of their contests.
The Pikas lost two of three.
and the SAEs split. 4 pair

there is at it.

One of Brown's. greatest.
