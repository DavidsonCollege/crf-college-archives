LITERARY VALUE OF BIBLE
DISCUSSED AT “Y” SERVICE

“The Bible as a Literary Masterpiece”
was the subject of Professor Erwin’s
talk at the “Y” last Sunday evening.

After stating that the Bible was taught
in many colleges today only for its liter-
ary worth, Professor Erwin showed that
such teaching was justified, first, be-
cause of its value as history. By citing

__instances he showed that the Bible was
not the history of Israel alone, but that
it was an account of the history of man-
kind from the beginning of the world
down to the era of Christ; a record of
civilization.

Leaving the historic worth of the Bi-
ble, Professor Erwin turned to its liter-
ary value. After mentioning that the
stories of creation and of the flood were
very similar to stories of those incidents
in other languages, he said that in addi-
tion to this the Bible contained a great
biography and drama in the book of Job.
It also contains almost every other form
of literature: the oration, in Paul’s
speech on Mars Hill; the short story, in
the books of Esther and Ruth; and the
world’s only great religious poetry in
the book of Psalms. :

The last topic that Professor Erwin
took up clearly showed the influence of
the Bible on the English language. He

_told of how, being translated by di-
vines, none of whom were prominent
scholars, it is recognized as being not
only the greatest Book in the world, but
the greatest translation of any book.
Translated at a crisis as it was, the Bi-
ble became the constant companion of
every Puritan and it obtained its hold
on the English people at that time, for
then the Puritans were coming into
power, led by Oliver Cromwell, and they
have been in power ever since. The Bi-
ble became the literary model for great
writers from that day to this; Bunyan
copied its style; in it Milton found his
inspiration, and even in this age Lord
Dunsaney admits that he tries to copy
the style of the King James version. Pro-
fessor Erwin said that. today there is
even a rhetoric based on the Bible and

finally “that throughout the world the
Bible is Recognized as The Book.
The serv was closed with a cornet

solo by George Dupuy and a prayer by
Professor Erwin.

FOUR COLLEGES VISITED BY

SECRETARY D. M. CHALMERS
’ Last week Dwight Chalmers, acting
Y. M. C. A. secretary for North Caro-
lina, made short but interesting trips of
one day each to N. C. State College.
Wake Forest, Trinity, and Carolina. ;

With A. S. King as secretary, N. C.
State has a strong “Y.” Possibly its
strongest feature is its Bible Study
classes. The attendance at these is ex-
cellent, averaging about 90 per cent of
the student body.

At Wake Forest five lively B. Y. P. U.
Societies are doing quite a bit of the
work which would ordinarily fall on the
“Y.” The social program there is a
very active oné? Last Monday a train-

lege spent the day at Wake Forest, it
being observed. as Social Day.

Although Trinity has no Bible Study
classes, the morning watch, which is well
observed, proves to be beneficial.

With a budget of $6,000, and a “Y”
building -being erected, Carolina expects
to do some good work this year. Her
first deputation team will be sent out
tomorrow.

Both Trinity and Wake Forest are
planning to secure secretaries for next
year. Wake Forest plans to erect a
“Y" building soon.

One of the first things that Dwight
noticed: at Wake Forest was the Char-
lotte Observer account of the Wake For-
est-Davidson football game on their of-
ficial bulletin board with the words,
“Please do not remove” underneath.

It is hoped and believed that Secre-|
tary Chalmers’ trip will not only stimu-
late the organizations which he visited
to undertake greater things, but that the
local “Y” will be benefited by new ideas
which he received from them.
