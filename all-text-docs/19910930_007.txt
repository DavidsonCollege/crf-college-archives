Kiss Me Kate:
Coming Soon To Hodson Hall

By Meg Kendall and
Leigh McKeever

Following fall break, Davidson
will be celebrating the 100th anni-
versary of the renowned playwright
Cole Porter with the production of
his 1948 musical Kiss Me, Kate.

After studying at both Yale
and Harvard, Porter begana career
that spanned seventy three years
and countless plays, films, musi-

cals, and songs. His more popular
productions include Around the
World in Eighty Days, a joint pro-
duction with Orson Welles, Les
Girls, Anything Goes, and Red,
Hot and Blue!

Kiss Me, Kate, based on the
play by Bella and Samuel Spew-
ack, was the longest running musi-
cal of its time in New York with
1,077 performances to its credit.

By 1965, the script had been trans-
lated into eighteen foreign lan-
guages. It was the first American
musical to play in Vienna, Ger-
many, Iceland, Poland, Yugosla-
via, Italy, Belgium, Hungary,
Switzerland and Czechoslovakia.

Critics welcomed Kiss Me,
Kate with open arms. Robert Gar-
