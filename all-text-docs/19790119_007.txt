Watson-McKuen concert a hit

By BILL PEEPLES
Senior Features Editor

A packed house is the grea-
test compliment one can credit
to a performance. Love Audito-
rium was filled to the bursting
point Friday night, where blue-
grass fans flocked to hear Doc
Watson and fellow artists.

Watson is the Ray Charles of
bluegrass-music..He is blind;
but his sixth sense, the sense of
music, is among the most acute
the world has produced.

In an age where
rock, and new m forms
appeal to minorities
and age groups; Watson and
company comprise the musical
bastion of the nation’s majority
group, citizens of Anglo-Saxon

The music and lyrics that’
accompanied settlers from the

British Isles became suppressed -

in the mountains and backwa-
ters of the new nation. Over
time styles changed and instru-
ments from other cultures e-
merged, such as the dulcimer
from Germany.

The- banjo, commonly at
red to as the only instrument
that is uniquely American, was
yet another addition. Whereas
bluegrass is considered by some
to be the product of conserva-
tive hillbillys, it is, in fact,
representative of many cul-
tures, with that of Great Britain
dominating.

Recent change has also come
to bluegrass, enabling it not
only to survive but flourish.

John McEuen, of the Dirt —

Band, reflected this change at
the concert.

Alone on stage at the begin-
ning of the perforniance, McEu-
en played his=

lad about a boy who wins a
fiddling contest in Georgia. He
also played selections from such
Dirt Band albums as ‘‘Dream”
and the “Circle” album.

mance, McEuen and Watson
were joined on stage by fiddler

The group added more vari-

numbers as ‘‘Blue Suede

Welsh to give Spanish
organ recital Tuesday
By J.W. ARETINO
Davidson Staff Writer
“Art postulates communion, and the artist has an imperative need
to make others share the joy which he experiences himself.”
—Igor Stravinsky

Tuesday evening, January 23, at 8:15 in the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church, gifted organist and Davidson music professor!
Dr. Wilmer Hayden Welsh will offer a unique recital consisting
entirely of Spanish organ music.

Dr. Welsh has just returned from a sabbatical leave in Spain
where he traveled to numerous cities, devoting special study to
organ music of the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. His work in Spain
will be reflected in a book he is writing for undergraduate students
studying organ.

Welsh’s decision to present a recital was based in part on studies
with Juan-Alfonso Garcia, a modern Spanish organist and
composer.

Garcia is somewhat of an authority of ancient Spanish organ
works and an important composer in his own right. A work by
Garcia if featured in Welsh’s program.

Spanish organ music presents an interesting merging of Christian
and Islamic cultures. Musical notation is characterized by
‘‘tablature,”’ or numbers representing keys, a trait unique to Spanish
compositions. :

Ornamentation, such as turns and trills, is a feature exemplifying
Islamic influences. Visual color, rhythm, and vivacity are captured
musically in a freedom of style and elasticity notably Islamic in
origin.

Welsh’s program begins with a short introduction of slides, and a
piece by Antonio de Cabezon, a blind composer, organist, and
harpsichordist who played in the courts of Charles V and Phillip I.
A work by Diego Jimeniz, ‘‘Batalla in the Sixth Tone,” promises a
special treat.

The recital is free and open to the public—an evening of beautiful

music performed by a talented artist.

“Donkey” appeals to all

By LINDA HOOPES®

Davidsonian Features Editor

Children have an amazing
perspective on the world—they,
seem so intent on what they’re
‘doing, and they see everything
in black and white, not the
muddled grays of adulthood.

The Dancing Donkey was
written for children and pre-
sented by the New Schoolhouse
of the Arts in collaboration with
the Davidson College Drama
Department. It appealed to the
children, and to the “‘child’’
inside many of the adults who
saw it.

The performance began with
the Very Special Orchestra”’
—four musicians playing won-
derful songs on xylophones.
These songs and all the others
in the musically-oriented play
are written by the cast. -

The play itself was, purely
and simply, fun! The ‘‘Scoun-

drel,’”’ played with’ cunning de-
vilishness by Rusty King and
Joel Shirk were, in reality, good
guys underneath.

They were adoringly admired”
by the two giggly, fair but
empty-headed damsels (Mary
May Oliver and Julie Webber).

Billy Badd and Ernie Pugg,
the scoundrels, steal the won-
derful dancing donkey (Cindy
Faulkenberry, who did an ama-
zing job dancing in a huge
donkey’s costume) of the friar,
played by Tom Bessellieu.

The simple plot was easily
understood by the children, who
cheerfully added their com-
ments and opinion to the perfor-
mance.

The ending, of course, was
happy. The friar got his don-
key, the girls got the guys, and
the audience, got to watch the
children having.a wonderful
time. —

Clothes reveal character

UNIVERSITY PARK, PA
(CPS)—“‘A woman wishing to
be known as a feminist,”’ coun-
sels Dr. Rebecca H. Holman, an
assistant professor at Penn
State University, doesn’t neces-
sarily even have to open her
mouth.

Holman, in a study of “the
language of clothes,’’ found
that the clothes the woman
wears will frequently do an
adequate job of getting ~~
point of view across.

Holman showed 200 male iis
female Penn State students
seven pictures of the same

model, dressed in seven differ-

photos, and was asked to
respond to 33 statements de-
scribing the woman pictured.
None of the seven styles, Hol-
man adds, were “revealing or

of the model in jeans, sweater,
and corduroy jacket showed a
woman who was a leader, and
one who was interested in
