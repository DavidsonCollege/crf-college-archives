The secretary-treasurer race was also
close. Alderman, Arrowsmith and Rader
fell by the wayside on the first day
Kiesewetter, Barrow and Crooks held
63 per cent of the-votes.

On Thursday Crooks was barely elim-
inated, and Kiesewetter led Barrow by
only one vote—135 to 134. Kiesewetter
won by a narrow margin on Friday, end-
ing a very close the
week between himself and Barrow.
Kiesewetter, captain of the freshman
basketball team and a member of Phi
Gamma Delta social fraternity, is from
Riestertown, Md.

The entire election, in the words of
“Skip” Brown, retiring Student Body
president, was “marked by keen compe-
tition and close races, even the race for
presidency being» almost unpredictable”
until the last balloting.

like a Philistine going up to worship
in the temple at Jerusalem. This strange
feeling has been completely eradicated
as the weeks have passed and I deeply
appreciate the way the men on the cam-
pus have received me, In coming back
next year I look forward to the con-
tinuation of friendships already formed
and the establishment of new ones. Any-
thing that has been accomplished this
year can be attributed to the Y. M.
C, A. Cabinet and the splendid codpera-
tion of the students in the work of
the Y.

“No organization on the campus has
served the students in the past as has
the Y, and no organization has the pos-
sibility in the future of holding so great
a place in the lives of the men. To
make this possibility a reality each man
will have to do his share. The work
this year has not been perfect, nor near-
ly perfect, and any suggestion from any
man of the campus will be welcomed.”

Prof. Erwin Talks
To Radio Audience

Says Literary Activity Impeded
By Careless Reading

With his usual cheery “Good evening;
ladies and ‘gentlemen,” “Skip” Brown
introduced the weekly radio program last
Thursday evening at 8 o'clock.

The program opened to the stirring
strains of “O Davidson” by the entire
concert band. The band then rendered
a concert march by Olivadoti entitled
“Hall of Fame.” This number was fol-
lowed by selections from the light opera,
“H. M. S. Pinafore,” by Sullivan.

The outstanding feature of the pro-
gram was a ten-minute address by Prof.
E. J. Erwin on the short story. Speak-
ing on behalf of the short story, Profes-
sor Erwin said: “We let ourselves fall
too easily into careless reading after
starting in the correct_literary direction.
The short story is one of the finest types
of good literature, and if the stories are
good literature, they will prove great
assets to every reader.”

The concert band then played “Scots,
Wha Hae Wallace Bled,” the Scotch na-
tional anthem, and “Lights Out,” by Me-
Coy. With “O Davidson” as a back-
ground, “Skip” Brown then identified
the spot of origin of the program and
invited everyone to tune in again on
the program at its regular time next
week.
