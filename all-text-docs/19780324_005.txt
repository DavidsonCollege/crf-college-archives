Baseball potential
creates optimism

By MIKE LINS
Staff Writer —

Spring has arrived with its
characteristic warm, sunny
days, blue skies, flowers bloo-
ming and birds singing. With
Spring’s arrival, the familiar
‘‘crack’’ of the bat echoes
through the air as the Wildcat
basebail team eagerly begins its
fifty-game season.

Coach Palmer Wench opti-
mistically expects a successful
season since he claims this
year’s team is ‘‘the best since
I've been here, and possibly the
best Davidson baseball team in

many years.

The reason is that we lost
only three seniors last year,
giving us twelve experienced
players returning, and we have
taken in eleven very capable.
freshmen. I feel that we are
strong in all facets of the game:
pitching, fielding, hitting and
base-running.”’
Pitching:

throw his wicked curveball.

aeception has consistently
fooled batters and has, resulted
in his perfect 2-0 win-loss
record so far this season.

Joining: Purcell on the star-
tingrotation is junior Ron
Caron, a strong throwing
saitiew: who has started for
the gats sincé*he was a fresh-
man. Junior Ken Norwood, a
‘‘smart’’ pitcher, has moved
into the starting rotation after
having keen a relief pitcher last
year.

Freshiyan Bill Duke, the
newest uiduver of the ’Cat
starting tain, throws harder
than any of the ’Cat pitchers,
and may be th@ fastest pitcher
in the Dads ere. As
he gains exper‘cuce’ in college
pitching, this freshman will be
difficult to beat.

Long relief pitching comes
from freshman Joby Merten
(record 1-0) and Dave Tornetta
while short relief pitching isi
done by Mike Lins (record 1.0)’
and John Madden. Also on th
staff are Freshmen John Young
and Rod Hanna.

Defeuse:

Muench says, “‘our team will
only go as far as our defense
takes us,’’ and so the success of
the pitching staff relies upon
good defense. So far this sea-
son, the ’Cat defense has proven
itself to be consistently strong.

Sophomore catcher Bob
Lapple, who was All-Southern
Conference last year, is behind

the 'Cats. His rifle arm consis-
tent throws out opposing base
runners whenever they foolishly
attempt to steal a base. Bac-
king up Lapple is freshman
catcher Yates Sealander.

At first base again this
season is junior Sid Osborne.

Senior co-captain Rick Blink-
horn, whose experience and
fielding expertise knits the ’Cat
infield together, starts at
second base. Freshman Blain
Sanders backs Blinkhorn up at
second.

The short-stop position is
being very capably shared by
freshmen Cam Zurbruegg and
John Porter (a high school
All-American). Both have dis-
played impeccable fielding so
far this season.

Tim Goodell plays thftd base
for the ’Cats, while being
backed up by freshmen John

‘‘Eddie”’ Haskell and Jeff Ray.

The infield has displayed its
defensive ability by turning
nine double plays in nine
games, which ties the number
turned all last year (in forty
games).

The ’Cat outfield also dis-
plays great ‘defensive prowess
with Jim Richards in left field,
Stan Brown in center field and
Tim McDowell in right field. All
three have good speed in cover-
ing the outfield and each throws
dangerously well.

In fact, this season, Stan
Brown alone has thrown out

[Gregg Strader]

three opposing runners at the
plate, while Richards and
McDowell have each contribu-
ted with crucial throw-outs.
Hitting:

‘he ’Cat battery combines
both power and consistency.
Brown has already slammed
three home runs and ten. RBI’s,
while Lapple and Goodell each
have hit two homers.

McDowell leads the team in
consistent hitting with a .393
batting average, followed by
Zurbruegg, Lapple, and
Osborne, all of whom are hitting
over .300.

With such consistent hitting
to get men on base, the ’Cats
have the opportunity to be
aggressive base-runners. The
team has stolen an impressive
31 bases in ten games. Richards
leads the team with eight stolen

bases, followed by McDowell
with six.

Outlook for the Conference:

‘This year the Cats have the
potential to be contenders in the
Southern Conference. Their
present Conference record is
2-0, having swept VMI in a
double-header last week.

The toughest teams to beat
will be Western Carolina and
The Citadel. Both of these
teams were very strong last
year, but this season the.’Cats'
are proving they have the team
capable of contending with any
Southern Conférence opponent.
