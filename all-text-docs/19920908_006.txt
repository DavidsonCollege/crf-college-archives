Community Mourns Loss

Last Tuesday, the Davidson College community lost an important member
with the passing of Mary Beaty. Beaty, who Dr. Leland Park described as “part
of the very fabric of this college and this town” served the community not only
as the assistant director of the library, but also as the chronicler of Davidson
~ College and townhistory. At herretirement last May, Park, the Library Director,
honored Beaty with a faculty resolution, part of which is reprinted below. This
community will greatly miss the work and caring nature of Dr. Beaty.

“Because you have followed Seneca’s bidding that “I am glad to learn in
order that I may teach,” and :

Because you have so expertly taught us in the library classroom as well as
in the scheduled classroom, and

Because you have lovingly chronicled our corporagé lives in the town and
gown, inspiring both our appreciation for things past and our reslove for things
to come, and

Because you have shown kindness and patience as well as instruction to the
secker, become an example others who have burdens to carry, and given
exquisite meaning to the term “A Daughter of Davidson”, we, the Faculty of
Davidson College, do now proclaim in your own native tongue, “Ave Maria,”.
Hail Mary!”

‘Fan Behavior Was Embarassing

Last Saturday the Davidson socéer team visited Wake Forest to play the
sixth-ranked Demon Deacons. Even though our Wildcats fell short of upsetting
Wake, Davidson was represented well by the team’s hustle and skill. Unfortu-
nately, certain Davidson soccer fans did a much poorer job of representing our
school.

As members of any athletic team will attest, fan support can provide a huge
boost. And while it was wonderful to hear more cheers for Davidson than for
the hometeam, a distinction needs to be made concerning. appropriate fan
behavior. It is sad that certain Davidson students would have to be told how to
cheer, but their behavior on-Saturday was, as George Bush would say, “beyond
the pale.”

The language and the terms used aren’t necessarily appropriate anywhere,
but to use them publicly inNhe presence of parents and other supporters, was
nothing short of vulgar. At a time when fans should have been proud to be a
Davidson student, many people spending their time trying to apologize for
their classmates’ behavior, These fams.did a disservice to anyone who is
connected with the Davidson College community. Unfortunately many people
now have an image of Davidson which is tarnished by the unsportsmanlike
. abuses hurled by a handful of inebriated underclassmen.

Support for soccer and other Davidson athletics is laudable, but in our rush
to support our classmates, let’s not forget that our actions, just like the athletes’,
represent the school. The kind of cheering heard on Saturday doesn’t want to
be heard by anyone, most of all the athletes. Our teams give us a lot to be proud
of and we ought to support them in a positive manner.

c

ana you.

Liberal Bias Strikes Again

To the Editor,

Over and above my in-
credulity at the lack of equal
time for political discussion
in the opinions section of
The Davidsonian issue num-
ber 1,-I am aghast at the
ignorant and sensationalist
garbage put forth by Mr.°
Kirtley as “REASON.”

#10) The President of
The United States holds NO
power to overturn Supreme
Court decisions. Besides, if
only “20 [to] 35 percent of
Americans (misogynistic
fundamentalists) believe” .
thatoverturning Roe v. Wade
“is a good thing”, pro abor-
tionists will have no trouble
passing their legislation in
the Congress if “Roe” is nul-
lified.

#9) Webster’s New
Collegiate Dictionary de-
fines Fascism as: “‘ a politi-
cal philosophy, movement
or regime. . . that exalts na-
tion and race above the indi-
‘vidual and that stands for a
centralized autocratic gov-

_| ernment headed by a dicta-

torial leader, severe eco-
nomic and social regimenta-
tion, and forcible suppres-
sion of opposition.” Dan
Quayle.a dictator? central-
ized government? (Clinton
and health care), economic
and social regimentation?
(Democrats and taxes, wel-
fare). Sounds more like the
Democrats to me. Ifitwasn’t
for Quayle on the Senate
Defense Committee we
wouldn’t have the “badly

bungled NASA experiment”
Patriot Missile, which saved
many Israeli, Saudi, French,
British,’ Egyptian, and
American lives, including
newspaper reporters!

#8) Let me tell you
about unfair, Ten years after
nothing, Anita Hill is sup-
ported by democrats to lie in
front of a Senate Judiciary
Committee for political pur-
poses. Now she is making
$10,000 a pop on the lecture
circuit. Remember what
happened to Supreme Court
nominee Ginsburg?
Where’s the magnifying
glass on Al Gore’s marijuana

history; I won’t hold my

breath. Willie Horton was a
convicted felon who, while

‘on furlough personally

signed for by Gov. Dukakis,
committed rape, robbery,
assault with a deadly
weapon, and. murder; and
that’s leaving out the graphic
details of torture and wit-
nesses. .

#7) ‘The nuclear threat
is over? Consider a scenario
put forth by syndicated col-
umnist Lars-Erik Nelson
(Washington bureau chief of
the New York Daily News),
in which hetraces the sale of
teftover nuclear warheads to
dictators such as Saddam
Hussein’ from “newly inde-
pendent Soviet Central

Asian republic(s)” strug- —

gling to-survive. U.S. his-
tory proves the folly of hasty
post warcutbacks in defense.
#5) Dan Rather is acrybaby

who once refused to report
the news because a football
game preempted eight min-
utes of his broadcast.

#4) How can any presi-
dent be held responsible for
mind reading a maniac who
doesn’t know the difference
between a region of Kuwait
and the entire country.

#2) The President of
the United States has no
power to levy taxes or bor-
row monies on behalf of the
federal government; it is
purely a legislative duty.
Youare wrong in saying that
the President is a hypocrite.
Fact: over 50 percent of the
federal budget is spoken for
in the form of entitlements
and mandatory spending
before the budget proposal
process even begins. How
do you suggest a president

_ balance the budget when he

can trim less than half of it?
With these constraints the
President’s current budget
proposal is still 40 to 50
billion dollars . less than
Congres’s.

Furthermore, Bush’s
balanced budgetamendment
also calls for spending caps
and bureaucratic reduction.
Tell me why; "in a recession
in which some employees
have willingly taken pay cuts
to keep their jobs, Congress
has voted itself pay raises?
And tell me why tax cuts
will inflate the deficit. The
capital gains tax cut is a

To the editor:

The Davidsonian’ s first
editorial saddenedme. With
our facing numerous cri-
ses—starvation and death in
Somalia, civil war in Yugo-
slavia, devastation from
Hurricane Andrew, an im-
portant Presidential race this
November, and myriad oth-

ers—you focused on the
problems of the college’s
new alcohol policy. Many
Davidson students exhibit
deepconcem aboutthe larger
world beyond this institu-
tion. I would hope that in
future issues you will ad-
dress subjects that indicate
that we, as well educated

individuals, are sensitive to
more critical problems than
those that affect Patterson
Court. :

Roberts Questions Kirtley

To the Editor,
Julian Kirtley’s “Top
Ten Reason Not to Vote for

Bush” was thought provok-

ing. After reading it I
couldn’t decide whicly was
more of acliche — the argu-
ment or the

“Lettermanesque” form he -
put them in.’
Sincerely,
Harrison Roberts
