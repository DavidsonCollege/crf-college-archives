Years At M&M Soda Shop

By BILL BARNES
Staff Writer

Twenty-three years ago last
Monday, Mary Potts and
Murray Fleming opened the M
& M Soda shop. They still run
it today and look as if they will
be forever. They’ve enjoyed
themselves immensely all
along, so much so that though
twenty-three years sounds like
forever, Murray will tell you
that “‘it hasn’t seemed like any
time at all.’’

Murray and Mary worked
together in what is now the
Hub before they bought the M
& M, where they set up shop as
a standard Davidson pit stop.
There they’ve remained and
though the old fraternity
plaques which used to hang
over the booths are gone,
Davidson College posters clut-
ter the walls.

Students will still stop in for
a break at the M & M, but not
as often as they used to and
very rarely just to sit and talk.
“Students aren’t as friendly as
they used to be,’”’ Murray will
tell you. But he and Mary

“ThiS last Saturday,”’ Mary
told us, “‘we had a great time;

all sorts of people came —

back.”

They have stories about past
years at the college that’ll
make you laugh. The M & M
has served as Saturday night
dinner-spot, off-campus
fraternity house, and alcohol
deposit when students left un-
finished. bottles with Murray

and everyone dropped in to
chat and it Was common to
ring up your own change on
the register.

Mary and Murray have
some excellent memories of
the old days. There’s nothing
they like better than seeing old
students back for a visit.

President Ford’s Omnibus .

Education Bill will enable
students to examine their own
confidential cumulative recor-
ds.

The section of this bill
dealing with student records is
intended to make this in-

pearing to be well founded.
The goal for the year was to
improve on the number 14
ranking that the school
received last year.

In ’73, professor Jack H.
Howe of California State
University co-ranked David-
son 14th along with-Colorado
College and Albion College on
the basis of outstanding per-
formances given in ex-
temporaneous speaking, im-

“But anyone who leaves
home at college age is going to
do what he damned well
pleases,” says Murray. There
were ways of getting around
rules.

Murray doesn’t miss the
years behind him too much,
though, with Mary, he’d like it
a little more, you get the im-
pression, if the college took a
little responsibility for student
actions.

Those days seem to have
gone, though, along with the
fraternity plaques on the wall,
freshman beanies and com-
pulsory chapel. It’s not often
any more that you meet
people over an egg ‘salad and
large orange at the M & M.
Murray and Mary are still
there, though, ready and
willing to speak to anyone. It’s
been twenty-three years now
and it looks as if they’ll make
it fifty.

Mary Potts and Murray Fleming celebrated Monday the 23rd
anniversary of the opening of the M&M Soda Shop.

Student files generally will
include scholastic records,
scores of IQ, aptitude, and
psychological tests, and also
admissions material and
recommendations.

The bill has been described

by many people as too vague

These recommendations

The law “should benefit the
Students, but, as it stands,
some problems could be coun-
ter-productive for students,
more harmful than helpful.”
Terry explained, ‘The

‘problem is not with the re-

cords, but with recom-

mendations, both to and from
us.’’ ;

“Will people still feel free to
write good, recom-
mendations under these cir-
cumstances?”

“This could create serious

problems for students,’”’ Terry
advised. ;

not yet have a definite policy
on opening student records,
