Why all the tie-dyes?

Do sixties fashions belie sixties attitudes?

By LISA GERRARD

A few years back, students who wore tie-
dyed t-shirts, torn blue jeans and “Jesus
sandals” were few and far between on the
Davidson College campus, men with long
hair stood out and hardly anyone wore
friendship bracelets. But styles have
changed and what was once considered
radical and a statement of individuality has
become the vogue. ”

Mixed reactions accompany the new
trend in fashion. More conservative dress-
ers like senior Robert Smalley are amused
at their friends who were wearing Duck
pants.and oxford button-downs last year,
but who now opt for cut-off blue jeans and
t-shirts. Those who were “hip” when hip-
pies weren’t cool wish the fad would fade;
in the meantime, Spencer House has a tie-
dye Friday Afternoon Club and the college
Student Store continues to sell its own
psychedelic t’s.

The look used to be radical -- a statement

of individuality very few dared, or desired,
to make. The connotations were sometimes
good: free spirit, social activist, at peace
with life. But sometimes they were bad:
“Dead Head,” druggie,’ incense-burner,

> hippie.

Senior Hannah Harrell says you know
times have really changed when you go to
the library and the guy coming out is wear-
ing at-shirt that’s almostas loud as his Polo
cologne is strong. The images seem some-
how incongruent, like the “southern gen-
tlemen” of Kappa Alpha playing Grateful
Dead at their parties.

According to senior David Ordoubadian,
some of the people who have been wearing
tie-dyes for years have packed them up
until the fad blows over. Senior Caroline
Hoffman says that she doesn’t wear the
friendship bracelet she has because “every-
one else has one.” The trend has created a
whole new breed of tie-dyers, introducing
what-sophomore Curt Perkins -calls_the

“weekend tie-dyers” or “party tie-dyers”
whoare trying “to achieve a unique fashion
Statement not surpassed by a computer-
generated one.”

Like many of the students who were
abroad last year, Hoffman was surprised to
seé so many tie-dyes when she returned to
Davidson. Harrell, who was with Hoffman
in Germany last year, says their freshman
year was different because “the few people
wearing pony-tails and tie-dyes really
stood out and had more in common: You
can’t associate the clothing with a type of
person anymore.”

Although the fashions have embraced a
Sixties dress, students say that there’s no
real revival of the Sixties attitude. “It’s
cute,” says Hoffman, “but there’s not very
much depth to it.”

Ordoubadian says, “Wearing tie-dyes
used to represent people who were willing
to break from the mainstream. It used to be

if you.saw someone witha tie-dye he was.a

Dead Head (listened to the Grateful Dead)
and that theme implied a lot; people as-
sumed a lot.”

It’s good that the styles don’t have to be
associated with drugs anymore, Harrell
says, but “sad for the people who might
want to make a difference in the way they
dress.” She remembers those who wore tie-
dyes as being very “laid-back,” but also
concemed about social issues and faithful
to Amnesty International.

Four years ago, the small, struggling club
averaged about 5 or 6 members at its meet-
ings. This year, Amnesty seems almost as
popular as the tie-dyes, as early meetings
have averaged 50-60 people.

Ordoubadian says that the popular “new”
look and the interest in Amnesty slide right
in with the times. “You see itamong a lot of
the music world, which is really going back
to the Sixties feel in their interests and way
they dress. Everyone is turning to the Six-
ties or the image of the hippies,”

hear the confessions--but no
longer--you’ve heard them all
before. And sometimes you beg
God to make your living partner
bald so you won’t ever have to
pull hair out of the sink (or your
carpet) again.

All this and more can be yours
if you go about dorm-life in error.
Face it, you’ ve got to share your

student, so you may as well like
him. Not all rules work for all
roommates, but the following are
some hints to help get you through
the rough times (e.g. when you're
walking up and down the hall ina
towel looking for a master key):

1) Use codes. A lot of roommates
simply have trouble because of a
lack of timing and observational
skills. For instance, when you
finally get the best-looking guy in
your class to come over to help
you with your biology homework,
the last thing you want is your
beloved roommate to come in and
share the experience.

Any previously agreed upon
sign left on the door (a big “X” on
the memo board, string tied
around the doorknob, or in areal
emergency--taping up a sexy .
black and white Calvin Klein ad)
will save you frustration and dis-
cord. Codes also work well at
partiés. A slight wave or triple-
sneeze (depending on your acting ©
skills) can.mean, “I am bored to -
death, come get me out of this
conversation.” Make sure your

roomie notices and you’reas good
as saved.

2) Always cover for your room-
mate. There are just seven simple

_ words to remember when your

roommate is partying on the
Courtand the parents call, “I think

- (fill-in roommate’s name here) is

at the library.” You probably owe
your roommate a favor anyway
for using a code used at.the last

party.
“personal space” with another ~

3) Always take phone messages
from the opposite sex. Abso-
lutely, positively, always “take a
message” when someone calls
your roommate and she is not
around. But whatever you do, if
it’s a guy, get his name and num-
ber. If she comes back and you
say, “Someone called for you, but
I forgot-to get “his” name,” she’s
going to be annoy You’re
messing with her social life. Few
roommates can overcome a blow
like this--so don’t let it happen.

4) Only sign up for classes that
meet at different times. No mat-
ter how well you get along with
your roommate, you probably see
too much of him. Atcollege, time
alone is rare, but essential. The
only thing worse than signing up
for scheduling your classes to-
gether is signing up for the same

Classes. Both are definite “no-

no’s.” You’ ll never have the room
to yourself (and have to abuse hint

~ #1) and you will walk everywhere ~

_ together; classes, post office, the
~ Court. But worst of all, you will
be expected to share your sink at

~roommate’s bed are not only

the same time. Either change your
roommate or change your major,
but don’t schedule your classes at
the same time.

5) Be blatantly honest from the
beginning. Don’t lie to avoid
“hurting your roommate’s feel-
ings.” If you’re not interested in
her album containing pictures of
all the children she ever baby-sat,
tell her. Your true feelings will
only come out later when she
brings it out for the 26th time
to show you her all-time fa-
vorite child. In your frustra-
tion, you'll probably say

benefit of the doubt.” When your
roommate eats the last piece of
pizza in the refrigerator (and
you’ ve been looking forward to it
all day), go on with your life.
“Don’t worry, be happy.” If it still
bothers you, tell yourself that she
was probably thinking about that
pizza for two days. You, there-
fore, would have done her harm if
you had eaten the last slice.

8) Have a sense of humor. What
more is there to say?

There were actually 10 hints,
but “Consistently complain about
your schedule” and “Shop for
your Own groceries” were de-
leted--just- follow them out of
faith. The article is already too

long and they weren’t as funny as
the rest anyway.
