Whicn prompts us to make a plea

the powers that be: Let'’em stay

Lest this appeal be interpreted as a
‘frivolous ‘salute to our welcome
guests. let us hasten to add that such
a suggestion is made in compleie ser
iousness.

While the Davidson gentleman {finds
the idea of: a coeducational Davidson
understandably foreign, after vears of
thinking of the school as ‘‘a small lib-
eral arts college for men.” the phrase
itself is something of a contradiction.
For a liberal arts education to be
gained in four years of the presence of
only one sex seems impossible.

The college catalogue explains that
Davidson “emphasizes those studies,
disciplines and activities which liber-
ate men physically, mentally and
spiritually.’

But an integral part of an educa-

tion is found in a man's relations with
the opposite sex. The two-day dance
weekend erammed full of concerts.
afterparties and lakeside picnics. i-
not en effective means of .cultivatin:
an-effective relationship with 2 _
Nor is the Saturday night jaunt to 2
nearby girls’ school. consisiing of four
hours spent at a movie or drinking
beer.

The complaint of Davidson being a
suitcase college is indeed justified.
but what alternative does the student
have? Aside from the infrequent on-.
campus social events, there are no
outlets for developing satisfying
friendships with the opposite sex.

Were Davidson to become coeduca-
tional. such unexciting events as study
dates. or working on thé newspaper
could become real opportunities to
know a girl as she really is, not how
well she dances and what color her
hair is.

Davidson has the physical possibil-
ities to become coeducational. The
college owns more than enough land
to the north of the present campus
to build a girls’ campus.

For the Davidson Gentlemen to be-
come truly liberated, we repeat our
plea: Let ‘em stay.

Reform By Whom?

An announcement coming out. of
last week’s faculty meeting indicating
long-range plans for study and event-
ual revamping of the entire curricu-
lum could be a milestone in David-
son's history.

While other schools have been mov-
ing ahead in fields such as independ-
ent study, Davidson has been content
to boast of a Humanities program
formed four years ago and an honors
program restricted to a small per-
centage of majors in a department
who maintain fairly high averages.

Both programs are good, but they
alone are not enough. Davidson must
step out boldiy for more changes.
Improvements made earlier this year
by the History and German Depart-
ments, expanding the number of
seminar: courses and making the ma-
jor with honors program open to
more students. serves as a step in the
right direction.

One aspect of the proposed curri-
culum study which concerns us is the
role students will play in the examina-

tion. Since the committee which will.

direct the study has not yet been ap-
pointed and few definite steps have
een taken in that direction. we can-

not say with certainty what the ad-
ministration expects in the way of
student response.

However, we are certain that stu-
dent opinion will be welcomed by all
faculty members, whether committee
members or not.

Students have always been quick
to press for liberalized rules dealing
with student conduct and individual
responsibility. These goals are entire-
ly. in keeping with the goals of a liber-
al arts college. But they alone are not
enough.

Any reforms in the curriculum will

undoubtedly also be taken in the. di
rection of more student initiative and
responsibility. For such changes to be
made with no student participation
would be ridiculous. But if they are
so made, it will be because of a lack
of interest and initiative on students’
part. ;
__While we have no way of knowing
what the eventual outcome of the
project will-be. since it will necessar.
ily be a long-range one, we urge
Students to begin now considering
and discussing what are the reforms
neéded to make Davidson a first-rate
academic institution.

From The Ivory Tower

There is an old myth thaf the mem-
bers of academe are locked away in
an ivory tower of intellectualism.

_which protects them from the cold.
hard facts of life in the real world.
The myth asserts that intellectuals
are too concerned with the theoreti-
cal and the abstract to become in-
volved in the petty day-to-day mat-
ters of the world.

Dr. J. G. Martin helped to destro
some of the authenticity of that myt
when he threw his hat into the ring
this week as a candidate for the Meck-
lenburg Board of County Commis-
sioners.

Whether or not one agrees with
Dr. Martin’s Republican candidacy or

with his political views is not of im-
port here. Party labels and political
persuasions are generally not deter-
mining factors of the effectiveness of
groups such as the Board of Commis-
sioners.-It is generally more depend-
ent on a group of men with a moti-
vating concern for finding solutions
to community problems.

What is of more importance to
Davidson is this evidence that a mem-
ber of the community has stepped
down from his imaginary pedestal and
shown the area outside of this hamlet
that he is willing to become involved
in the sometimes dirty business of
politics to bring about a more decent
community.

_ Spring Frolics ‘66 will be a very wet weekend.
with extremely hazardous driving conditions devel-
oping Thursday night and continuing mostly through

noon Sunday.

Some 700 Davidson gentlemen with the help
of their dates will consume at least 300 gallons
of legal alcohol worth some $5,000. Each couple
will travel during the weekend an average of 150

miles on the highway,

LIVING ARRANGEMENTS

Dr. Peterson stresses tha: on
27 issues. ranging from poor.
instruction to academic freedom
to peace demonstrations. the
number of siudents involved
never went higher than eight
per cent of the various student
bodies. And that top protest fig
ure was about dormitory and
other living arrangements such
as women's hours in men’s dor-
mitories. Almost as high a per-
centage of students complained
vociferously over regulations

CIVIL RIGHTS

But Southern civil-rignts work

“he  ca'atively few colleges

-eparied. says Dr, Peterson.

So much for the much pubdjic

zed poor quality of Faculty and

inc ‘publish or perish’” issues
as spurs to mass student ac-
won.

But. ne points out, “there
obviously are substantial num-
bers of students willing to make
known publicly their antagon-
ism to ex.sting situations—espe-
cially those -situations where
there is a perceived moral con-
tradiction er hypocrisy. And
there is every indication that
numbers of student activists
have been multiplying in the
past five years.”

In fact: Dr. Peterson says.
“the current surge of student
unrest and active protest must
certainly be among the most sig-
nificant developments in high-
er education. perhaps in Amer-
jean society, of the mid-1960s.
As a cultural phenomenon, as a
social force. it warrants being
understood."

INTELLIGENT STUDENTS

Like other researchers before
him, Dr. Peterson finds that
the highly intelligent student is
the. most likely to protest.
Rather ironically, he points to
the “relative peace’ at teach-
ers’ colleges and technical in
stitutes.

But especially in large uni
versities of over 10,000 studen:s
—such as Berkeley—the intelli-
gent student meets  largé
classes: faculty disinterest. in-
tense competition for grades—
and resultant widespread cheat-
ing — control of personal life.
and suddenly it's all a “rat

race’ and the protests are on.

What next? Will the protests
grow or diminish?

Like the authors of' the recen>
faculty committee report at
Berkeley. Dr. Peterson believes
they «ill grow. He is eyen quite
specific.on what the protests

i ge about. For example. he
cays. :‘vaf selective universities
that have no: witnessed Viet

‘Nam protests. the. likelihood ‘s
“quite good that they will in ‘the

yery, near furure.”’ Catholic
colleges are. much more likely

to ave organized complaints

abo:: inflexible curriculums

ahan are independent universi-
ties? If-there is a chapter of the

Students for a Democratic So-
ciety on campus, the probabili-
ty of student ferment is greater.
“Vier Nam will be the top pro-
iest issue in the immediate fu-
ture. as it already is this aca-
demic year.
CONCERN FOR POOR

However, “once the hot war
4s over, there is likely to be an
upswing of active student inter-
est in two broad areas.” The
first, whicn has already begun
in the cities of, the North and
the East, will be a concern for
the ‘‘excluded’’—efforts to im-
prove the conditions of the poor.
the dispossessed and the power-
less.

After that will come new in-
terest in reforms in higher edu-
cation. “Restrictions on the per-
sonal behavior of students will
continue to come under heavy
attack.’’ says the 58-page study
‘Ie is not clear that there is
any great. moral revolution cur-
rently: in progress.”

“More importantly.” Dr.
Peterson cohcludes, “all man-
ners of policies and practices
which tend to be at odds with
the best possible teaching.
which prevent a genuine com-
munity of students, and which
subvert opportunities for acti-
vities judged to be personally
worthwhile will increasingly
be targets of student agitation.“

The number of agitators may
remain relatively small. but
who is to deny that revolutions
have always been started by an
active and vociferous minority?

will either pretend they do not exist or make these

Attitudes like these

cause most students to

chant that. old refrain (cause it’s not for knowledge
ete’’} just for pure spite when they don’t really mean

it.

WHY WE CAME TO COLLEGE...

No one will deny that the focal point of the col-
lege experience should be the development of the
intellect. But there is a place in a campus commu-
nity for a little organized hell-raising. The same
forces that impel brilliant students to develop their
intellects also require more violent physical out-

lets.

To grow into effective men, most males must
assert their masculinity in forms their society may
officially condemn. Somehow this energy must be

the

expended in a manner satisfactory to

anti-so-

cial impulses and without bringing down the law in

the community.

This revolt, often against authoritarianism, is
frequently a forerunner of creative ability and pro-
vides the energy which maturation will channel. To
smother this fire with a tough drill or a puritanical
administration is to encourage this energy to re-
appear in a more violent form.

In short, the more violent recreational outlets
of Davidson gentlemen—i.e. alcohol and sex—are
legitimate activities and concerns for the campus
community. That college should be foremost an
intellectual endeavor is true, but life in a campus

community involves more than this.

The Davidson

campus should be a community in conflict or dia-

logue.

In such a community there is no area of

student lives that should be free of critical exam-

ination.

_ Our objective should be a more mature and
vital student intellectually, physically and socially.
To deny facilities and dialogue for these more vio-
lent physical outlets is to hinder this objective un-

necessarily.

MORE BULL

tiful nymph in some idyllic glen on a_leisurely
day in the warm green spring. Too bad most of
us have to run from one place to another to get in
