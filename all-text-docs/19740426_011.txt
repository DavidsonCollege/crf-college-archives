After weekly searching,
C.A. and Y.B. have finally
found the IMAC scores,
believe it or not. We kid-
napped Chip Stone’s secretary

and Chip was forced to tell
Bowie Kuhn to give the scores

The drop point was the back
porch of Terry Holland's
house where a greasy looking
detective named Callahan
gave the scores to Ganja, the
wonderdog, who ran lickity

fortunately, that is not what puts winning numbers
on a scoreboard.

In order to qualify his claim, Scandling refers to
the wrestling team’s performances over the past
few seasons. Now, I am not going to quibble with
him about his first two seasons, but his last two
have not produced much as far as team results are
concerned.

He then claims that scheduling is the answer. But
if you want to win and have to schedule high shcool
teams to do it, I do not think you accomplish
anything.

His argument seems to boil down to this: scholar-
ships imply expectations of winning; he (and I
assume the wrestling program) do not want this
pressure: therefore, keep scholarships out of
Davidson intercollegiate athletics. Q.E.D. ;

My answer, then, would be to first, find out just
which coaches want scholarships and give them
some. Next, figure out why the coaches who do not
want scholarships feel this way. If it is because
they are scared of the expectations that would be
upon them, then get someone who is not afraid.

It seems quite obvious to most people that
scholarships are a necessity to keep up with the in-
tercollegiate athletic race. If we fail to meet this
need, then we are going to suffer heavily in the
coming years in places where we least expected to
encounter problems.

Scandling made the point that ‘‘although
everything seems to be working against us, I still
feel that we (the wrestling team) can compete
respectably.” I guess he and I must have a

i cy as to our definitions of respectable.

Don’t get me wrong. I am not against wrestling. I
think they should get the same benefits as other
sports. I just feel that scholarships would certainly
be an asset to them also.

For those who just want to have fun, we have club
sports and intramurals. So let’s not take the soul of
athletic competition out of intercollegiate athletics
at Davidson.

Oh, One More Thing. . .

This last note is to correct Scandling’s mistaken
impression about the functions of the Wildcat Club.
According to Executive Director Sandy Carnegie,
the organization only raises the money that will be
used in the athletic program. The coaches, ad-

ministration and trustees decide how the money

will be allowated!

split back to Duke 222 and
dropped them off.

He was rewarded with a jar
of peanut butter. Or would you
believe the IMAC office door
was unlocked?

In the first round of tour-
nament action, 4th East and
Delt II both forfeited them-
selves into oblivion. How
anyone can forfeit a tourney
game we don’t know, however
they did.

In live action the fighting
Beavers of 4th floor Richar-
dson decimated KA2 by an
unknown. (The goofy umpire
didn’t write down score.)

Anyhow, we're waiting for
the Beavers to split a double
header one of these days.

Also in the first round
Richardson II beat PAX 13-12
in an extra inning affair (soun-
ds like a soap opera).

The Gozinyas whipped
Vatican II 4-2 and were led by

Richard ‘‘Microman’’ Hen-
drix and Jim Prince.
The surprising ATO’s snuck

past SAE I 4-1 in a defensive
battle. The ATO’s spring
training in Tiajuana must
have paid off. John Stanfield
and pitcher Brad Tipler led
the way for the battling
zeroes.

The first round’s big upset
was the defending champion
Kerwood Derbies’ surprise
victory over I Felta Thigh.
The 6-3 upset was led by Billy
(Graig Nettles) Lynn's two
homers and Doug Ey’s circuit
clout.

The 3M Corporation shut out
Cannon IV 10-0 while Stick and
the Sticklettes ended CLAP’s

cinderella dreams with a 13-0
thrashing. Cornelius Lint And
made the fatal error of retur-
ning to earth to play in the
play-offs. They should have
stayed in orbit folks.

C-V stuck their co-occupants
in C-I with an early departure
in the tourney by nipping the
boys from below 10-8.

KA¥#1 showed why baseball’s
considered a southern type
sport as they continued to
shine, beating the Cannoners
10-zip.

Powerful Arcadia turned
back the Derbies 84 behind
shortstop Juan ‘‘nothing
gets by or through"’ Sanchez
and catcher Andy “‘try to steal
on me and I'll beat your ass”’
Dorr.

Also in the Quarters are the
MG's, Beaver, Gozinyas, Ar-
cadia, Q-12, PDT#1, and 3M
Corp.

C.A. & Y.B. are going to go

with Q-12 to take it all with
maybe some competition from
Arcadia or the Delts.

Anyhow we would like to
congratulate Larry Hardaway
for being elected new D.C.
“dog catcher’. Also we'd like
to welcome ‘“‘the Circus” to
the basement of the Union;
although it is young, it sucks
too. Where is ‘‘the Jungle’,
“tthe Gods,”’ and the darned
Foosehall table.

So as Spring Frolics ap-
proach be sure to get your
float ready, and yourself
ready too. And you freshmen
(you too Y.B,) remember that
the Humes department has
conviently scheduled their
term paper due next Monday
after this calm week-end.
Such foresight.

As C.A. & Y.B. throw

caution to the winds we say
two more weeks to go and then
...summer school. Hoo Boy!
