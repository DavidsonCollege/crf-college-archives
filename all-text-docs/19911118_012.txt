Freshmen Players Could Contibute Immediately McKill a

George Spain
Spain, 6’7" and 235 pounds,
comes to Davidson from Spring
Valley High School in Columbia,
S.C., where he averaged 12 points
per game on 68% shooting from
the field last season. The left-
handed Spain has an odd-looking
"shot that is nevertheless effective.
His aggressive play inside should
translate into plenty of timeat both
the center and power forward posi-
tions.

center.

The other contender for the
strong forward spot is 6’8" junior
J.D. Heuer. Weight work has made
Heucr a bulky presence inside, but
he isalso gifted with shooting touch
to twenty feet. His perimeter abil-
ity makes him an option at the 3
spot, though his lack of speed cre-
ates defensive matchup problems
for Davidson there.

For the third straight year, the
7°70" Musch will start at the center
position. Musch averaged 9.9
points per game in each of his first
two years at Davidson and im-
proved his game this summer play-
ing on a German team that toured
through Europe. His strength,
hands and shot-blocking have
improved remarkably over the past
two years and continued improve-
ment should make him the class of
the Big South at the center spot. If
Musch can score consistently in
the post, the Davidson guards and
small forwards should reap the
benefits with open jump shots.

The final piece to the team is
freshman Franco Ferroni, of Rim-
ini, Italy. The 6’7" Ferroni is ru-
mored to be an offensive threat
from every position but the point,
but has not yet been allowed to
practice with the team. The
NCAA’s inquiry into a possible
rules infraction involving Ferroni’s
Italian club team has dragged on
_ for several weeks, but it appears a

ruling on his eligibility is immi-
nent. McKillop says that “Franco
could be the most versatile of our
frontcourt players.”’ The addition
of Ferroni would give the Wildcats
additional depth and scoring punch
from both the post and the perime-
ter.

This year’s Wildcats will fea-
ture an aggressive man-to-man -

~defense that denies every pass.

* that defense caused numerous turn-
overs which led to fast break bas-

Frank Harris

Harris was named all-New
York City last year after a senior
seasonat Riverdale Country School
in which he averaged 29 points, 7
rebounds and 4 assists per game.
Harris’ outside shot lacks effec-
tiveness, but he is a fine ballhan-
dler and penetrator, and can finish
the play inside. The Wildcats’ depth
at the guard spots makes a starting
role unlikely, but Harris should see
time at both guard positions.

kets. Constant defensive harass-
ment, combined with excellent
conditioning, could make the dif-
ference for Davidson late in games.

The ‘Cats motion offense,
predicated on frequent screening,
cutting and ball reversal, demands
constant switching by the defense
and causes breakdowns that result
in easy shots. Holloway and Narat,
in addition to Zimmerman, must
sink the open outside shots for the
offense to be effective.

Last year’s freshman-laden
team struggled to find its bearings
early in the season and lost a
number of close games. McKil-
lop’s assessment that “the great
thing about freshmen is that they
become sophomores” is simplis-
tic, but indicative of the greater
maturity which the sophomores
will bring into this year. The three
returning sophomore starters,
Narat, Holloway and Zimmerman,
should make better decisions in

their second seasons, and Musch.’

should be improved at center.

Davidson is among t the most
talented teams in the Big South,
rivaled’ only by Radford and
Coastal Carolina. The Wildcats’
depth gives, them a number of
scoring threats at every position.
Perhaps the key to the season,
though, is what kind of contribu-
tions the team can get from the
power forward spot. If McKillop
can get consistent offensive pro-
duction from Drobnitch,.. Spain,
Heuer or Horton, the Wildcats will
be very difficult to stop.

The improved Wildcats should
be able to outdistance depleted
Radford and Coastal teams to fin-
ish firstin the Big South. This year,
Davidson’s final season in the Big
South, provides an unrivaled op-

"portunity for the Wildcats to return

to the NCAA Tournament-for the
first time since 1986.

Davidson’s difficult schedule
includes the home opener against
‘Alabamaand trips to Wake Forest,
N.C. State and South Carolina and
two games against cross-county
rival UNCC. The ‘Cats should
finish 16-11 (11-3 in the Big South)
and represent theconference in the
NCAA Tournament.

Franco Ferroni

Ferroni arrives at Davidson
after a distinguished club career in
Italy in which he led his team to
five Italian Championships. Healso
played on the Italian Junior Na-
tional Team that won the Euro-
pean Championship in 1990. Fer-
roni is a versatile player who can
score from inside and outside and
play four of the five positions.

Big South

~ Continued from page 1]

In addition, Big South Rookie
of the Year Joe Spinks (11.6 ppg)
also returns. Spinks was the lead-
ing rebounder in the conference
last year with 9.4 per game. The
guard spots, however, are some-
what more of a question. Leading
scorer Rod Gourdine (19, 1 ppg)
graduated, leaving ’' sophoimére
Jamie Lee and junior Steve Martin
to run the offense.
UNC-ASHEVILLE

The Bulldogs lost their two top
scorers from last year’s 8-20 (4-

10) team; center Brent Keck and ©

guard Darryl Sanders combined
for nearly 27 points and 10 re-
bounds per game last year. .

But they do return three start-
ers, among them point guard Jeff
Lippard (7.3 ppg and 6.3 apg), and
could receive a boost from 6’5"
forward Derek Borden. Borden sat
outlast year after transferring from
Virginia Commonwealth. 7°2"
junior center Scott Barnes, who
hails from Perth, Scotland, could
take Keck’s place in the pivot. He
transferred from Brevard. :

The Bulldogs will be severely °

testcd by an extremely difficult
non-conference schedule. They
travel to Syracuse, Florida State
and Clemson.
LIBERTY

The Flames returnall five start-

ers from last year’s 5-23 team,
including team MVP Mike Cole-

‘ man. Coleman, a 6’7"senior cen-

ter, led the team in scoring and
rebounding a year ago (15.8 ppg,
10,1 rpg). 6’10"sophomore Julius
Nwosu, a Nigerian import who
averaged 10.9 points and 6.8 re-
bounds last year, returns at for-
ward.

Sophomore Matthew Hilde-
brand, who averaged 4.9 assists at

Linton Elliott

Elliott, who hails from San
Francisco, Ca., made the team as a
walk-on. He isa very good outside
shooter who is a constant threat
from three-point range. Elliott is.a
hard worker who has aclear under-
standing of his role in the offense.
He stepped up in the first Red-
Black scrimmage toscore 8 points,
including a pair of three-pointers.

Apologies to Linton Elliott--

the point guard spot last year, re-
turns, but could be spelled by jun-
ior Cordell Robinson, who trans-
ferred from Southern California
for reasons unknown. A trio of
sophomores, Chris Toomer, Brett
Anthony and Willie Roach, will
fight for time at the 2-guard.
CHARLESTON SOUTHERN
The Buccaneers lost four start-
ers from a team that struggled to
stay out of the cellar last year, so
the, outlook is, bleak,,677," senior
forward Bernard Nelson is the only
returning starter and one of just
three lettermen who return from
last season’s 4-10, 9-19 team.
Nelson averaged 10.8 points and
6.5 rebounds a game in 1990-91.
Juniors Willie Ellis (7.3 ppg)
and Jason Romano (injured for
most of last year) should handle
the guard spots for the Bucs. Inter-
nationals Christian Wober, of
Austria, and Falur Hardarson, of
Iceland, are among seven fresh-
men who will be forced to contrib-
ute immediately.
WINTHROP
_ The Eagles struggled through
an 8-20, 5-9 campaign last season,
‘but the future seemed hopeful since
all five starters were to return. A
un at the conference title seemed
realistic. But the loss of starting
point guard LaShawn Coulter to
grades and starting forward George
Henson to eligibility problems
makes such a possibility remote.
Henson may be ruled eligible
toplay in January, and even a me-
diocre Winthrop season may hinge
on his return. —_
Sophomore guard Carlo Wilk-
ins, junior forward Eddie Gay and
junior center Mark Hailey all re-

turn to reprise their starting roles,

but the losses of Coulter and Hen-
son will likely be too difficult to
overcome.

Freshman Mike Fayed might

‘be given the point guard slot in

Coulter’s absence,

that they received from a number
of fans who were at the game. I can
be very clear in stating that I will be
much more sensitive to that in the
coming year.

Davidsonian: Which teams will
vie for the Big South champion-
ship?

McKillop: Coastal Carolina be-
cause of their history of success,
Radford because of their wealth of
experience, and then I think all the
rest of the teams in the conference
present problems for us.

The parity that exists in the

“eonference is there between a

number of teams. I would think
that-in almost every game in the
conference this year there is not
going to beaclear-cut pattern as to
who’s going to win and who’ snot
going to win. ~~

Davidsonian; How will the Big
South’s automatic -bid into the
NCAA Tournament affect your
program?.

McKillop: Right away it’s a cata-
lyst forrealizing adreamthatmany
of our players have had since they
came to Davidson and since they
dreamed. about playing, college
basketball. .
wu he change, of getting an.im-
mediate bid, the respect that con-
notates and the tangible nature of it .
have really spurred us on to work
extremely hard in the preseason as
we prepare for the actual first game.
-There’s a lot of excitement as
we look to the season and we look
to the conference. With this being
our second year in the Big South
Conference, some rivalries that
have. developed have created a
sense of excitement that did not
exist last year,

Last year was kind of a hope
that a lot of things had to work
exactly right forus to getan NCAA
bid. This year, it still is a dream,
butit’sa much more tealistic goal.
It’s a dream that stands before us,

Davidsonian: What types of
changes, if any, will you make
with this year’s squad to prepare
fornext year’s entry into the South-
ern Conference?

McKillop: I don’t know that we
can focus on next year while trying
to play for this year. However, I’d
be less than candid if I did not tell
you that we will follow very closely
their [Southern Conference teams’]
scores and the success they ‘have
on recruiting trails. :

We will be trying to gather as
much informationas possible’ with-
Out intruding on our current focus
as we prepare for next year as well,
