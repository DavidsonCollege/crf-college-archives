To The Faculty:

Why Soph Rush Won't Work

We write this editorial reluctantly,
with a little sadness.

We have always been in sympathy
with the spirit of Sophomore Rush;
we heartily approve of its goals.

Last spring this newspaper conced-
ed that Sophomore Rush was an ac-
tuality. We urged that both the ad-
ministration and the fraternity sys-
tem begin immediately preparation
for the implementation of the new
program. As far as we can see,
neither group has done anything sig-
nificant.

Furthermore, we have changed our
minds. Last spring, we were skeptical,
but we were willing to give Sopho-
more Rush a try. Now we have come
to the conclusion that it is not worth
trying.
~ You have been pestered for three
months now with objections to Sopho-
more Rush. From the standpoint of
the fraternity man, some of these ob-
jections are valid. It will now cost
more to be in a fraternity. Several of
the smaller houses may not be able
to absorb the expense. This leads to
a second objection: two or three fra-
ternities are likely to fold.

We admit that this will accomplish
‘one Sophomore Rush goal—the num-
ber of Independents will be increased.
But we would hesitate to “strengthen”
the Independents with men who are
disgruntled and bitter because they
could not afford to stay in their fra-
ternities or because their chapters
were forced to resign their charters.

But these are objections to the sys-
tem; these are factors that will hurt
the fraternities, and many faculty
members evidently aren’t too con-
cerned with how badly the fraterni-
ties are hurt.

What about the system itself? Why
won't it work? Why won't it achieve
its goals? We have four answers.

1. It will not work because at least
60 percent of the student body is des-

perately opposed to it. Sophomore
Rush was conceived and nurtured by
a handful of dedicated people. This
handful and a reluctant administra-
tion can't make it work when 600
men are fighting it every step.

2. “Dirty rushing” will run ram-
pant. Sophomore Rush advocates scoff
at this argument, but they underesti-
mate. the dedication of some fratern-
ity men. A boy who is willing to sac-
rifice a summer job, summer school,
or a trip to Europe to spend three

Firm, Dignified And

The Student Council 1s delivering

the goods as we expected (see last

week’s editorial, “The Court’s Last
Chance”). At this week’s meeting, the
council members. in decisive and un-
animous action, voted to combine the
offices of Freshman Adviser and the
judge of the Court of Control.

This action will put new life into
the Court, since it will now be in prop-
er perspective as an integral part of
freshman orientation. To use the
Council’s terminology, the Court will
be “firm, dignified and rigorous.”

The Court will not be a guidance or
advisory board. It will present the
freshmen with the freshmen regula-
tions and will enforce the regulations
with vigor. With the ‘“don’t-walk-on-
the-grass” regulation tossed aside, the
Court stands with a meaningful set of
regulations. These regulations deserve
enforcement. With the Freshman Ad-
viser guiding the Court, it will move
to acquaint the freshman with David-
son traditions and to instill in the
freshmen respect for these traditions.

The Court will be dignified because
it will be pursuing worthy objectives
in a worthy fashion. With the Court

months just preparing for one week
of rush isn’t likely to let up during the
“off season” before Sophomore Rush.

About 40 or 50 members of each

freshman class will be rushed for a
year instead of a week. This rushing

may not be quite as strenuous as

Rush Week, but it will be concerted,
and will be a serious block of effective
studying on both upperclass and un-
derclass levels. There is absolutely no
way of enforcing any prohibition of

rushing over a year’s time.

3. The freshman’s social life will
be severely limited. There is no way
of getting around the fact. C. Shaw
Smith and the Union Committee have
grandiose plans for exchange dances,

better facilities, more Chinese Check-

er Boards, etc.

‘ But, gentlemen, when the weekend
comes, students want to get away
from Davidson. They don’t want to
stay cooped up in David Ovens Stu-
dent Union with a checker board and
a girl - who - didn’t - have - a - date-
for - the - weekend - so - she - came-
to - Davidson.

You say Sophomore Rush will
strengthen the Independent group?
Why, freshmen will be so glad to
pledge a fraternity that the ratio of

fraternity members to Independents
may very well increase.

4.-Sophomore Rush will not put to
an end impositions on a pledge’s time.
There is a growing attitude among

fraternity members that “if we can’t
have freshman pledging, we'll give
those sophomore pledges all kinds of
hell.”

Childish? Sure, but that’s beside
the point.

You argue that the more mature
sophomores won't stand for this non-
sense? Fraternity men answer you
bluntly, and with alarming truth:
“They'll stand for anything to get that
pin.”

These are our reasons for believing
that Sophomore Rush will be a weak
and ineffectual system.

And what do we offer as an altern-
ative? We make no offer.

We leave it up to you. Draw us up
a program that you feel is sane, but
fair to the fraternity system which
has been one of Davidson’s most
prominent assets since the turn of
the century.

The fraternities can either accept
it. or reject it and accept Sophomore
Rush.

Rigorous

under the supervision of the. Fresh-
man Adviser, the freshmen will look
upon the Court with respect.

The Council’s actions should quiet
the disgruntled liberals, even though
they will not have their advisory com-
mittee. On the other hand, these ac-
tions will please the supporter of the
firm, strong Court because they sup-
ply just that — a workable firm,
strong Court. |

The Council's deliberations on the
Court of Control are not yet over. It
expects to discuss the Court for at
least one more week and possibly for
two. The Councilmen still have sev-
eral items to work on in the Court
program, principally, its duration,
penalties for violations, and the feasi-
bility of Court chapel sessions.

Indications are that the Council will
recommend a longer period of dura-
tion and stiff penalties for violations.
The Council may also take the Court
out of chapel entirely. These policies
will complete the Court program and
will insure a mature, well-rounded
Court of Control in coming years.

We congratulate the Council on
their careful, thoughtful deliberations
and their solid actions.

Also Has Support Abroad

A stronger foreign policy
seems to be anticipated by sev-
eral Richardson Scholars be-
cause of the change in admin-
istration of the United States.

In a poll conducted by THE
DAVIDSONIAN this week, elev-
en of the fifteen Richardson
Scholars were asked, ‘What
will be the reaction in your
country to Kennedy’s becoming
the next President of the U.
s$.2"

Most of the eleven students
interviewed thought the news
of Kennedy's victory would get

a positive reaction when it
reached their homelands.

KENNEDY'S FATHER

Steve Wood from Surrey,
England said that “many peo-
ple didn’t like Kennedy’s father,
so they probably prefer Nixon.
I prefer Kennedy myself since
I like his social ideals. You
Americans are bound to get so-
cialization of some kind some
day.”

“Personally, ’'m for Nixon,”
Richard Dawids from Denmark
| remarked. “so I'm disappointed
‘over the election. I left home
before the camnaign really had
lity is f but I. think the major-

ity is for Kennedy.”
i
“NEW F.O.R.”

Kristian Juel thinks the re-
action in Norway as a whole
will be positive. “Many people
at home see in Kennedy a new

reasons. The socialists and the
liberals will rejoice and the
conservatives will be more re-
served,” Jucl added.

Although Uel Schnewlin hesi-
tated to evaluate which candi-

date was favored most in Swit-

zerland, he said, ‘In some cases,
I noticed that the older gener-
ation rather preferred Nixon
as more conservative, while
many of my own age group
chose Kennedy, because he is

jon in Austria. .

in many respects an unusual
leader. . .”

FOREIGN POLICY

Four Richardson Scholars
from Austria, West Germany,
Holland, and Colombia empha-
sized the impact the new ad-
ministration. will have in the
field of foreign policy.

Wolfgang Mayerhofer said,
“I think it is the general opin-
. that we are
looking forward to a change in
America’s foreign policy, not
in principles but in, practice.

“We're looking forward to
seeing in Kennedy a_ strong
president, a man who can stop
Khrushchev's insulting and ag-
gressive behavior. . .”

GERMANS POSITIVE

Arnold+ Kroner from West
Germany thinks the reaction in
West Germany will be positive,
“although the present govern-
ment would have probably pre-
ferred Nixon, because Nixon
looks more uncompromising in
defending -every foot of free
land (for example, Quemoy and
Matsu).

“Also, Nixon doesn't want to
négotiate with the Russians, if
the Russians don‘t show first
good will," Kroner continued.

“But public opinion probably
has been more for ‘Kennedy, be-
cause he seems to be more ac-
tive than Nixon. The German
people would like to see the
Americans take the offensive
in the struggle . between the
free world and Russia, and not
like it is now, that the US.
always defends only against at-
tacks from Russia.”

CATHOLIC VOTE

According to Kroner, many
Germans .would rather see a
Catholic as President than a
Quaker because “the Presbyter-
ian Church is not very popular
in Germany.”

“Holland will certainly sup-
port Kennedy,” Johan Strating
stated. Since two-thirds of the
seats in the House of Represen-
tatives in The Netherlands are

Faculty Group, IFC
Receive Letter’s Sting

Dear Editor:

The students concerned about
Sophomore Rush seem to think
a sacrifice made by them to
appease the gods of the alter-
ation will put life back on the
usual mad first week of school,
This is logical, since the IFC
hasn't got the courage to make
itself useful in any such situa-
tion.

There is another way, how-
ever. This is via someone (or
group of ones) acting as a
fieson between faculty and
students. {t would seem that
the faculty fraternity commit-
tee would fill this role. Un-
fortunately, it wes the reluc-

Roosevelt, a man who was ex-
tremely popular in Norway
though mainly for emotional
tance to take eny section that

a this committee showed, that

resulted in the acceptance of
sophomore bids.

If this committee is to justify
its existence, as it should have
last year, it will come up with
a feasible way of effecting
Sophomore Rush; or some one
of the other plans.

held by Catholics and Social-
ists, Strating inferred that Ken-
nedy’s religion and the fact
that he is “more to the social-
ist side than Nixon” would lead
over two-thirds of the Dutch
people to favor Kennedy.

“LOST PRESTIGE”

Another student from Hol-
land, Hans Mensink, said, “Since
the United States has lost pres-
tige in the world and since the
world situation during the past
year... has been getting worse,
the general feeling in Holland
is in favor of a change in the
administration of the U. S. in
favor of .. . Kennedy.”

Concerning Colombia, Luis
Quintero explained that during
Eisenhower’s adm in‘istration
Latin America has expected bet-
ter co-operation of the U. S.
Government in the growth of
the two countries.

“Unfortunately,” he said, “no
particular care has been taken.
Many people in Colombia hope
Kennedy’s administration will
be really concerned about our
economic development.”

Anders Trydell from Sweden
commented that elections in
Sweden this fall have drawn at-
tention away from elections in
the U.S., and he was wary of
predicting how the sentiment
in Sweden would lean.

Per Leander, also from Swe-
den, pointed out how little an
“everyday Swede cares about,
the election” by giving a fongue
in cheek analysis of the effect
in Sweden.

HAIL AUNT MARY!

“So now it’s over, the pivotal
event of the year! And the time
for the groaning and lamenta-
tion in Sweden has come. All
the supporters for Mrs. Nixon
hid their ‘Pat for first lady’
badges, and in their despera-
tion they decided to stay at
home all day.

“But as nearly half of the
population wanted ‘Jackie for
first lady of the Universe,’
there were people enough to
start the daily ice-bear hunting
and common immoral life at 10
a.m. when their most savage
signs of happiness had subsid-
ed.

“And their joy had such pro-
portions that they invited the
Pat-supporters to come out from
their hiding - places. However,
the Viking nation is still split.
May it be united in the ‘Caro-
line for first baby" movement!

‘Hail Aunt Mary! Hail Uncle
Sam!”

TANNER’S THESAURUS

Sleep, Girl,

Have New Meaning

By JIM TANNER
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Whenever an individual en-

ters any particular realm of
endeavor, he finds that each
different realm has its own ver-
nacular. This vernacular may
be composed of entirely new
words, or it may simply consist
of new meanings for common-
place words.

Davidson is a Realm of En-
deavor. Davidson men are En-
deavorists (even if you leave
out Saturday. night). Thus Dav-
idson has its own vernacular.
(No, that doesn’t mean it smells,
Irving). It is similar to the sec-
ond of the two types mention-
ed at the start of this master-
piece.

Davidson's vernacular is
quite subtle; outsiders cannot
grasp its hidden meanings,
its secret inflections. The
words sound like plain old
ordinary run - of - the - mill
commonplace humdrum sim-
ple everyday vunspectacular
- « « (pant)... words. But
they sren‘t.

So awright, awreddy, what am
I building up to, you ask. (Go
on, ASK). Here it is, kiddies:
gather around the flickering
campfire, or frosty pitcher, or
whatever, while I regale you
with a selection of words that
have changed in meaning for
me!

HOME —a place that gets
more attractive every day.

SLEEP—a verb synonymous
with fail.

GRADES—(usually preceded
by the adjective bad) a means
of determining how much sleep
someone gets: good grades, no
sleep.

BROTHER — any one of a
group of perhaps fifty compar-
ative strangers to whom Jife-
long devotion and loyalty has
been sworn.

MONEY—. . . come again?

TIME, FREE — ... come
again again?

REVIEW—has a direct rela-
tionship to sleep: hours of
sleep are inversely proportion-
al to number of reviews.

STUDY —an act performed
dutifully by the admirable few
who can survive without eat-
ing, sleeping, going, anywhere,
or having any fun.

GIRL—something there ain’t.
never hardly any of.

CHURCH — a place where

everyone congregates when the
mood strikes them.

MEALS—what are crammed
down in the morning and after-
noons, enjoyed at supper, and
drunk on Saturday night.

IMPOSSIBLE—due tomorrow.

UP THE ROAD—a place, not
a direction, where Saturday
night’s meals are usually pur-
chased.

There are many more such
words—words that will never
be the same. This is not good.
The average human being is
not strong enough to withstand
these mental rearrangements.
Hence most Davidson graduates
spend the rest of their lives
screaming “No! I'll fail!” at the
mention of sleep; trying to dis-
cover what having money is
like; drinking their meals; and
trying to make up for years
spent without the companion-
ship of “what there weren't
never hardly any of.”
