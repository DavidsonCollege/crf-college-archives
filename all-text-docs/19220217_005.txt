CAMEL QUALITY

We worked on Camels for years before we put them
on the market. Years of testing —blending—experi-
menting with the world’s choicest tobaccos.

And now, EVERY DAY, all our skill, manufactur-
ing experience and lifelong knowledge of fine tobaccos
are concentrated on making Camel the best cigarette
that can be produced.

There’s nothing else like Camel QUALITY. And
there’s nothing else like Camels wonderful smoothness,
fine tobacco flavor and FREEDOM FROM CIGA-
RETTY AFTERTASTE.

That’s why Camel popularity is growing faster than

A better cigarette cannot be made.

We put the utmost quality into
