man Joe Beach in 47th place, and
sophomore Greg Fisher, whoended
his season well with a 48th place
finish.

Though the men’s team was
disappointed with their perform-

ance, coach Gary Andrew had -

nothing but positive comments.
“We’re still a young team, and the
Whole team wasnotin perfect shape
all the time. For some, today was a
season PR. For the others, we’ll
just go from here. We still have
lots to work on towards the future,
but I am very proud and satisfied
with our performance today.”

Andrew’s leadership and train-
ing techniques landed him the
Coach of the Year award for the
women’s team in the Big South
Conference. Further accolades for
the women included a silver tro-
phy for their extraordinary efforts,
Plaques for Beach and Marshall
for their all-conference finishes,
and the Runner of the Year award

the ‘Cats other score. Quarterback
Kevin Holzworth led aneight-play,
58-yard drive, the climax of which
was a seven-yard touchdown pass
to Tim Carrigan. Holzworth re-
lieved Howell early in the third
quarter and remained for the rest of
the contest.

Fagg focused more on the excep-
tional performance by Hampden-
Sydney than on the ‘Cats play.
“Weknew they were awfully good,
but we made a mistake by compar-
ing them with Guilford and Emory

and Henry.”

He'went on to praise his team for
“hanging in and fighting hard.
They’re [Hampden-Sydney] just
an exceptional football team.”

“The bottom line is that we didn’t
execute today and that’s what wins
football games,” Holzworth said.’

“We had some mistakes and they
capitalized on them,” Mills added.

Fortunately for the ‘Cats, they
are off this weekend before bat-
tling Bridgewater College at home
on November 16 toend the season.

“In two weeks we'll be ready,”
Howell promised. ““We’ vehad bad

times before, but we’ll bounce

back.” -

15-13, 15-7 victory over the schol-
arship-laden and more athletic
49ers was a shocking upset.

The ‘Cats ran out to a 9-2 lead
in the first game with remarkably
fluid play, before the sleeping
Forty-Niners suddenly awoke.
UNCC strung together 12 consecu-
tive points to take a 14-9 lead, and
it looked like the beginning of the
end for Davidson. But’ just as
quickly, the momentum shifted
again. With junior Rachel Th-
ompson serving, the ‘Cats ran off7
Straight to steal the game 16-14.

It was a similar storyline in the
second game. Davidson jumped to
an 8-4 lead with the hitting of Mimi
Plauche and Janet Delery before a
UNCC run negated the advantage.
The 49ers assumed a 10-9 lead by
setting up their more athletic hit-
ters for kills, and seemed ready to
win the game and go on to win the
match. Again, though, the ‘Cats
countered with a streak of their
own. Saving digs by Mimi Plauche

the 49ers in the. Davidsun Fall
Classic two weeks ago.

“T was afraid the team would
suffer aletdown and come in over-
confident after we beat UNCC 11-
1 last time,” said coach Jeff Frank.
“Butas Albie[Varoski] and Holt’s
[Vaughan] three set wins show, we
were ready to play.” ,

Varoski struggled against
UNCC’s number one player, Stan
Cocke, who has always played well
against Davidson. Varoskidropped
the first set 7-5, but dominated the
next two sets 6-1, 6-2 to finish his
fall season with a 7-3 record.

“Last year someone like Kur-
tis Zabell never could have beaten
aplayerlike Cocke,” said Varoski.

Freshman Holt Vaughan was .

the only other Wildcat to have a

difficult match. Vaughan dropped

the second set 5-7, after winning
the first6-3. Vaughan recovered to
win a close third set 6-4... Frank
was also pleased with the play of
Russell Briggs atnumber 2 singles.

ButFrank also emphasized the
tremendous depth displayed by the
Wildcats in the expanded format

wins. “Not only does the fact that
three new doubles teams won show
our depth, but it also: shows our

strength in doubles,” said Frank. °

“T’m. very happy with where our
doubles is at this point in the sea-
son, and we ae only get bet-
ter.”

Frank was ecstatic with the
play of the team this fall and right-
fully so. The team was undefeated
in dual match play and won two of
the three tournaments it played in.
“This has been a storybook fall,”
said Frank,

cal of the team’s play. The players
were confident and tough. I hope
we can carry this into the tough

Rugby Program Developing

By. Bruce Page
In thé late 1960's, Davidson Col-
lege Kugby was a powerhouse in
the North Carolina Rugby Union,
but Davidson didn’t play a full
season of rugby from then until
1989. Since then, however, rugby
has been growingasaclub sport at

Davidson, and has again become a

force to be reckoned with. In fact,
the.team won a trophy at the state
tournament two years ago.
‘Seniors Tim Harris and Mike
Malloy run the team this year.

Twenty-seven playerscomprise the

-1991 roster, but since 15 are on the
field at the same time in a match,

“the squadis looking formore play-

ers to scrimmage during practice.
Presently, the team has representa-
tion from every fraternity and the
independent ranks, and has play-
ers from éach of the four classes.

Open practices are held
Tuesdays and Thursdays at
4p.m.on the Upper IMAC Fields.

on after that. Wagner made a
sprawling dig that helped the Wild-
cats to a 7-3 lead. Amy Howard’s
dink service ace made it 9-3, and
Anderson’s angle kill made it 10-
3. Plauche mashed one for a 14-4
cushion, and Davidson closed out
the match 15-7.

Afterward, the team was re-
luctant to leave. A throng of play-
ers and parents gathered on the
court to celebrate as the workmen
pushed in the bleachers around
them. Hawkins often says that the
secret of her team’s success is that
the wholeis greater than the sum of
its parts, and it was never more
evidentthan in the winover UNCC.
Thescholarship players on the floor
for UNCC were, on the whole,
bigger and faster and jumped higher
than their Davidson counterparts.
But the 49ers lacked the team unity
and chemistry that was Davidson’s
defining characteristic.

Tuesday night’s match with
UNC-Greensboro will immedi-
ately follow the men’s soccer game

- with UNC-Asheville, and will be
the final appearance at Belk Arena
for seniors Plauche, Hathaway and .
Knight. Free pizza and Coke will
be given away in the hopes of
drawing 1,000 fans. The confer-
ence tournament begins Friday in
Asheville.

Styles gives her team balance.
While “Holt leads by example,
Mimi is much more verbal on the
court.” She calls Knight “‘one of
our sparkplugs,” the kind of vocal,
hustling player that makes the team
“greater than the sum of its parts.”

What has set the three seniors
apart more than anything, though,
is how much fun they have playing
together. Says Knight, “I laugh
harder when I’m playing volley-
ball than anywhere else. I wouldn’t
trade these years with them for
anything.” Make an effort to catch
the end of an era Tuesday night at
Belk Arena.
