AND THEN SHE PASSED OUT

Bobby Glenn had gone to see his best
girl. They were sitting on the sofa, a
nice comfortable sofa before a roaring
fire. She was beautiful, as all girls should
be. An embarrassing silence was broken
by a heavy sigh, he seized her lily white
hand, and looking into her beautiful
brown eyes, whispered, ‘Darling, I love
you. Won't you take charge of my kit-
chenette?”

Avoiding his gaze, she shook her head
as a sign of refusal, not darnig to trust
her voice.

At this he leaped to his feet, rushing
out into the hall, grabbed his hat and
strode towards the door, but at the
threshold he paused, “And tomorrow they
will be dragging thé river for my dead
body.”

“Oh, Bobby, not that,” she cried.

_ “But they won't find it,” he finished,
“for Iam going home to bed.”
