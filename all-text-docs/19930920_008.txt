Yasir Arafat, Yitzhak

Rabin, and their facial hair

By Tony Tuntasit

In a concerted effort to con-
form to the Opinions editor’s re-
quest for “writers with sincere in-
sights,” today I’ve decided to dis-
cuss a very pertinent world issue:
The Israeli and Palestinian Peace
Accord.

As I was watching the Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and
PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat shake
hands over an agreement that tem-
porarily settled disputed territory
in Israel, Icouldn’t help but notice
that Yasir was sporting a nice gruffy
batch of stubble while Yitzhak
looked as if he was one of those
world leaders that fell in the cat-
egory of the perpetually non-fuzzy.

This seemed to be a problem
for Rabin. He seemed a bit intimi-
dated by this, and while shaking
hands, could only muster a meek
smile to Arafat’s “I’ve got more
facial hair than you, ‘peach-fuzz!’
HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!” wide-
toothed grin. Yasir was confident.
Yasir was the man.

Abundant facial hair(on men)
has long been a desired trait
amongst men and women. The
ancient Neanderthal culture often
measured a man’s stature in soci-
ety by the length of his beard. The
longer the beard, the older the man.
The elders usually had the long
spindles of grey hairs while the
younger guys hada puny foot-long
stubble. And the hairy guys usu-
ally got the women:

NEANDERTHAL MAN:
Woman! Here! Come'meto cave!!
Do the pterodactyl!!!

BETTY: Oh Billy, you know
we’re only friends.

NEANDERTHAL MAN:
(Burps) You do it with Spencer.
What difference me and he?

BETTY: Well, you know,

Spencer, he’s just hairier, you
know? He’s got hair on his face,
ears, bellybutton, nose and even
on the bottom of his feet! Now
that’s sexy. And besides, I don’t
want to jeopardize our relation-
ship.

NEANDERTHAL MAN:
(Scratches) Uh, OK.

Eventually, excessive facial
hair became an evolutionary no-no
and with Yasir Gillete’s ingenuity,
man had his first razor: two very
sharp rocks.

After several severe bouts of
razor burn, chaffing, and epidemic
shortages of Old Spice, technol-
ogy soon improved, and finally
men could shave and trim their
facial hair in styles recognizable
today, like the goatee, the beard,
the plain moustache, the Amish
look (see Witness) and, of course,
the Don Johnson cool guy five
o’clock shadow.

Isuppose that facial hairmakes
a guy look older. People tell me
that I should grow a goatee so that
I look don’t look so much like a
kid.

Unfortunately, my facial hair
refuses tocomply. Itdoes gives me
enough hair so that I look un-
washed, “Hey Tony, you got a bit
ofdirtunder yourchin. Hee! Hee!”
but nothing significant.

But what’s the big deal about
having alot of facial hair, anyway?
Does it mean that you’re more ofa
man? Nah. Will women dig you?
Who knows with women? Are
you going to be more popular?
Probably not. All it means is that
you have to get your butt out of bed
at the wee hours of the morning

and try to coordinate your actions-

so that you don’t end up walking
around campus with wads of toilet
paper adhered to your cheek.

Everyone's favorite seven little no-no's

Being a senior has few perks,
but the biggest one is having cable
TV right in your very own living
room. There is not one minute in
the: 1440 per day (who says En-
glish majors-are crummy math-
ematicians?) when there is abso-
lutely, positively nothing on. I

“mean, sometimes I’m forced to *

watch the Inspirational Channel (a
dream come true —televangelists
24 hours a day reminding me that
I’m going to rotin Hell) or MTV (a
dream come true — millions of
reasons for me to not mind Hell so
much; look at all the company I’1l
have).

Speaking of Hell and eternal
damnation, recently I saw a blend-
ing of the two worst channels of
cable. No, Robert Tipton is not
banging his head while a hot babe

Semester in Exile

Frampton takes a beating

I heard through the grapevine
thatthe sophomore class has a little
joke about me. It goes something
like this: “I must be cool because I
can drink as much as Frampton.”
In response, I just want to point
out, that, on a good day, the sopho-
more class sucks.

Now, I don’t really mean that.
Nor did I mean that the freshmen
are a bunch of dorks. However, I
have a policy taught to me by the
illustrious humorist, David Thomp-
son. I never apologize for my
articles, so I guess I do mean all of
that stuff.

Anyway, before class at
UNCC the other day (and no I did
not pull for the 49’ers in the soccer
game) I stopped to talk to one of
the fraternities signing freshmen
and sophomores for their annual
tush. The frat boys were very
helpful, telling me I looked like I

‘might make a good frat man. Then

they handed me a little book de-
signed to inform potential brothers
about the fraternity system.

Really, though, it was a guide
for thase interested in joining a.

house, providing them with infor-
mation designed to lead them into
the proper fraternity. I figured I’d
do the same thing for the freshmen.

The format isa little loose, but I’m
sure everyone will figure out how
this thing works.

Do you think you are God’s
gift to the fairer sex? Look for a
KA bid.

Do your career goals involve
selling insurance in Duluth? You
should be a Sig Ep.

Forget yourname sometimes?
Phi Delt.

Forget your name for chemi-
cal reasons? PiKA.

Have an affinity for hats with
farm equipment logos? SAE is for
you.

Feel guilty if-you go a whole
week without talking to your

from sophs

mother? Hey, you’re a Squid.

None of the above? Go FIJI.

Moving on...

(Folks, I’m having a really
hard time coming up with an ar-
ticle that doesn’t talk about beer,
so you’ll-have to forgive me if I
wander.)

Do you ever wonder why the
people at Dow Chemical Com-
pany named their all-purpose
cleaner “Fantastik” with a “k.”
Probably some type of code thing,
or maybe they just can’t spell too
well.

_ Now let’s get on to what I
really want to talk about, and that
is the general state of the opinions
section.

Under the fine leadership of
Alex Crumbley, who, seriously,
does a wonderful job, the section
has sunk to what one teacher re-
ferred to as “its lowest point in
years.” 4

What I want to know is why
that is.

It’s certainly not Alex’s fault,

See Framp on page 9

in tight leather rubs on him. I’m
speaking of MTV’s special on the
seven deadly sins.

For your fun and entertain-
ment, I’m now going to examine
my conscience in front of God and
everybody. Feel free to do the

Nathan
Seay

same.

The first deadly sin I can re-
member is sloth. I committed this
sinall the time as akid. My friends
and I would spend all day doing
nothing but hanging upside-down
from trees. But I don’t plan on
climbing atree fora while. Evenif
I wanted to, I don’t think my arms
could pull my butt up there. TV is
a much better way to blow off
things like school and church. Sloth
is not a problem for me.

Envy isup next. I’m fine with
this one, too. I have no desire to be
one of those people like Brett
Easton Ellis who gothis first novel
published at age 19 or Shaquille
O’Neil who is earning millions of
dollars at my age. Covetousness is
pretty much thesamethingas Envy,
butithas to do with people’s wives.
I don’t think this sin is fair. Het-
erosexual women and gay men
have a definite advantage at this
one.

But I’mnotjealous of Richard
Gere for marrying Cindy Crawford
or Billy Joel for marrying Christy
Brinkley. No, I prefer to be a poor,
struggling college student.

I like the fact that women
would rather face a slow, painful
death than have a five minute con-
versation with me. It builds char-

acter.

Number three is Gluttony. I
wasn’t sure what this was until I
watched the MTV special. Itseems
that gluttony is a synonym for
bulimia. I pass this one with flying
colors. You should see all the food
that I leave on my tray in the com-
mons. I only vomit up what I’ve
consumed after I drink to excess.

Lust? Next question, please.

Number six is Anger. The
two or three people who know me
can attest to the fact that I’m a
harmless tree-hugger. I’ve almost
had a mean thought a few times,
but I’ve never wished misfortunes
upon anyone. No, I really would
be grieved if Rush Limbaugh
choked on a big chunk of steak.
I’ve only felt compassion for
people who don’t know how to
merge into the interstate as I’m
stuck behind them for hours after
almost winding up in their trunk.
No, Anger is not part of my vo-
cabulary. :

The last and greatest of the
seven deadlies is Pride(we all know
where the Marines are going now,
don’t we?). Now this one is by far
the easiest to prove my innocence.
If you’ve ever seen me at a party,
you know that there is not one
ounce of pride in my body. Be-
sides, could anyone with pride put
their name on top of this newspa-
per column? I’ve done a bang-up
job on Pride.

I see a lot of parallels in my
life to Jesus’. I denied pride just
like Jesus did when Satan offered
him the world. Yeah, I sure am
good at not being proud.

I feel much better now. I
haven’t committed a single deadly
sin. I may be a failure in this life,
but at least I’ll inherit the earth or
something.
