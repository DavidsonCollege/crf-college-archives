The Davidsonian: what good is it?

By JIM ENTWISTLE
Editorial Page Editor

A few months ago, I came across a
letter in our office from an alumnus
who wished to cancel his subscription
to The Davidsonian. His reason, in
essence, was that he “‘got all the news
about Davidson from the Update.”

My first reaction to this letter was
one of mild indignation that anyone

tor

considered The Update to be an
adequate replacement for The David-
sonian. Obviously, this alumnus had
not been reading the student paper
closely. enough to discern the readily
apparent differences between the two
publications.

Yet, soon I realized that perhaps
this alumnus had a valid point. In
recent months, the two Davidson
newspapers had been providing simi-
lar services. Both had been primarily
covering events at Davidson in a
straightforward, factual manner with
little emphasis on providing an inter-
pretation of those events. But, pro-
viding just “‘pure’’ news coverage is
the role of The Update, not The
Davidsonian.

This is certainly not a slight
towards The Update. Let’s face it,

The Update is basically a money-
raising tool for the college.

By furnishing coverage of the

positive and the pretty at Davidson in
The Update, the administration hopes
that alumni, trustees and parents who
read that paper will be impressed
sufficiently to contribute to the
college.

The Update is often criticized by
students for providing only an overly
optimistic view of what goes on at
Davidson, and I’ll be the first to say
that it would be reassuring to know
that alumni and trustees were reading
about the negative and not-so-nice at
Davidson.

Yet, when The Update is recog-
nized for what it primarily is, a fund
raising instrument, it is possible to
understand its tendency to accentuate
the plusses and overlook the minuses.

The point is that The Davidsonian
should provide more than just news
coverage, but frequently in the past
has allowed itself to fall into this

Drinking stance criticized

To the Editor:

With respect to the editorial,
Protect our drinking rights, and
especially the statements, ‘‘If we
want to get drunk and pass out that is
our business,’’ and ‘‘If we want to
come into the 900 Room nude that is
our business also,”’ I wish to take a
stand.

I recognize the possibility that
there has been a failure of proof-read-
ing (unfortunately, no newspaper is
entirely free from such failure), and
that something has been omitted or

distorted. I also find it conceivable
that the statements were written with
the date of publication, April 1, in
mind. If the former is the case, one of
the most regrettable lapses of proof-
reading has occurred; if the latter, I
hope that few readers were taken in.

If, however, as I believe is the case,
the statements accurately represent a
serious attitude, I hope that we as a
community can prevent its spread
and can find a way to insure that it is
not translated into action. Getting

To the Editor:

i find that I can-tolerate tiger
itcompetencies but I find that I can
net tolerate a major fallacy when it
concerns something near to my very
way of life. This letter is in reference
to your article in the March 17 issue.
Your reporter Brenda Boyle was
either grossly misinformed or simply
lackadaisical in her article about the
recent National Intercollegiate
Squash Tournament.

Her first error is that the N.C.A.A.
does not ‘recognize squash. The
association which runs this tourney is
not affiliated with the N.C.A.A. Her
second error is that I was the initiator
of Davidson’s participation in

intercollegiate squash. I went to the

quite a bit of time $etting publicity
and support for o®* campaign
northward, I am sure that you
understand my position. Our story -
appeared on local television and was
fully endorsed by Tom Cartmill. In
fact, our success in Annapolis is due
largely to his efforts. I hope that you
can understand my annoyance at this
omission as I spent the entire winter
term preparing for this tourney.

To the Editor:

Last Saturday Davidson College
students proved what many people
have believed all along. The students
here can consume and enjoy alcohol
without losing control of themselves.

The people that attended the Union
Party on Saturday afternoon res-
pected the rules of the college and the
Union, and except ‘for the minor
incidences: that occur whenever a
group of that: size gets together, we
felt that ng one’s right to ‘enjoy the
afternoon was infringed.

We want to thank the Davidson
College community for being the
courteous and fun loving crowd it is.

“pure news” rut.

The current staff has worked hard
and effectively to make the paper
more than just a news digest; to turn
it in a forum which the many
controversial and crucial issues con-
fronting our school can be discussed
and debated.

How has this change been imple-
mented? By providing news analysis
in addition to news reporting, by
having several opinion columns in
each issue and by presenting a
FOCUS which each week examines an
aspect of the college in depth and
from all angles.

Yet, these innovations are not an
end in themselves. The end is to
transform the student newspaper into
a tool which will take up issues that
need attention and will become a focal
point for the development of solutions
to these problems.

In recent weeks, the paper has been
criticized several times for providing
inaccurate coverage of the news.
These assertions have been true.

In our haste to develop The
Davidsonian as a forum, we have
allowed some shoddy reporting to get
into print, for which there is little
excuse. Yet, these errors were primar-
ily aggressive mistakes resulting from
an eagerness to make the student
body aware of what is going on
around them.

This paper is also sometimes put
down for being excessively negative.
In the past, there has been a tendency
for The Davidsonian to overlook
some positive notable achievements
in the college community.

But these achievements are over-
shadowed by the fact that the student
body is getting the short end of the
stick in several crucial areas of college
policy and if the student newspaper
needs to be negative in order to make
the students more aware, the The
Davidsonian’s negativism actually
serves a positive function.

Izt.our attempt to develop The
Davidsonian into,a forum for the
discussion and consideration of cam-
pus issues, there has been tendency
for an elitism to develop, i.e. a certain
group of people write most of the
stories and columns.

This isnot because a select few
want to exercise complete control over
the newspaper, but because few
people are willing to devote the
necessary time and energy that
working fer The Davidsonian re-
quires. Thiire is a real need for greater
student participation in the paper, so
that those with some experience can
devote their time to the necessary
tasks of editing, proofreading and
layout. ay

The Devidsonian, hopefully,
reaches most members of the college

‘community each week and because it
does, it has the greatest opportunity
of any campus organization to exert a
positive influence over the future of
Davidson College. Excuse me for
sounding trite, but the student news-
paper has the potential to develop
into the ‘cutting edge”’ of the college
community.

How can you as an individual
student help bring this about? If you
have the time and/or inclination,
come work for us.

If not, the take an hour each week,
read The Davidsonian, reflect on what
we have to say and then let us know
what you think.
