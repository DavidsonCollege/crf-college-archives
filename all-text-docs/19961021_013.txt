Will’s World
Be a fan

By WILL BRADSHAW

Sports Editor

All you have to do is turn on
the television.

Maybe it’s fall and the
Golden Domers are roaring in
South Bend. The students will be
standing... all game. During ev-
ery timeout every will begin do-
ing “the Lou,” Notre Dame’s ver-
sion of the Tomahawk chop.
Faces and chests will be painted
every week, whether it’s snow-
ing or not.

Or maybe it’s winter time,
and basketball dominates the air-
waves. It could be Temple,
Tulane, UMass, or Durham’s
own Duke Blue Devils. It doesn’t
matter. The pictures are still the
same. Students with nets on their
heads, jumping around and mak-
ing such a racket that opposing
team’s can’t hear themselves
think. Coaches pull their teams
away from the fans during
timeouts in a futile attempt to be
heard. You hear about students
camping out for weeks for first
pick of the tickets.

But, you won’t see anyone
pitching a tent on Davidson grass,
and don’t hold your breath for
painted faces. Because unless it’s
basketball season and we’ ve got
a chance at the Big Dance, you
probably won’t see any red and
black fans. ©

But why not? Why are our
fans so apathetic?

At the beginning of the
women’s soccer game against
rival Furman on Wednesday
there were three students, and
twelve fans in the stands.
TWELVE! And most of them
were from Furman. So much for
an intimidating crowd presence.

Last year when the team
traveled to Furman the fans threw
things. They yelled, heckled, and
generally made life miserable for
the Wildcats. Starting defender
Natasha Vasavada said “it was
terrible.” But at least this time
they would be at home. Some
difference.

The loudest person in atten-
dance was a Paladin-backer sit-
ting all by himself in the visting
bleachers. He was audible
throughout the game in the
pressbox, which is perched atop
the home stands on the other side
of the field, Imagine what he
must have sounded like to the

players. And imagine being a|

player on a team whose home
fans make less noise than one
guy.

Iknow you have work to do.
| We all have a lot of work to do,

and maybe you don’t,care much
about sports, but, I’m going to,

chance that you do because you
have read this much of this ar-
ticle. So I challenge you to’ be

rowdy. Paintaface ortwo. Come:

out and support'the athletes who
put themselves on the line every
week for this school. Let them
know that we’re proud of what
they do. At least let them know

Rusby crushes Western Carolina

The Davidson rugby team won
in impressive fashion on Saturday
against Western Carolina, punish-
ing the Catamounts, 36-0.

Matt Burkhardt began the on-
slaught by scoring a try on a long
run and converting the kick, giving
Davidson a 7-0 lead. Wingman
Jason Cody followed by beating
several Western defenders around

the end and then cutting back in-
side to push the ball into the try
zone.

An impressive passing se-
quence led to the third Wildcat try.
Eight-man Michael Schenck took
a pass out of a maul from second-
rower Will Baldwin and flipped it
to flanker Thayer.Long. Long
tossed the ball to fly-half Hank
Ackerman, who passed it to wing
Christian Baker. Baker took the
pass, evaded some would-be tack-

lers, and eventually found a score.

“That was a great exchange
we had,” said Long. “The passes
were right where they needed to be
and Christian finished it off well.”

Ackerman scored the next
Davidson tty, scooping up a loose
ball around midfield, breaking
away from the -pack and racing
uncontested to the try zone.

The Wildcats, up 26-0 at that
point, continued to roll as Schenck
tallied another try. Long capped

the Wildcat victory, catching a
tipped line-out pass near the Cata-
mount try zone and pushing across
the line for the score.

“Our ‘D’ was tenacious to-
day, and we totally dominated the
scrums,” said prop Mike Lassiter.

“We tackled well, pressured
them on defense, and controlled
the ball on offense,” said coach
Paul Kenney.

“This was a great team ef-

fort,” added coach Blaine Segal. .

While women’s soccer con-
tinues to struggle with scoring,
the team has re-defined stingy,
allowing four goals in regulation
in the last seven games, dating
back toa Sept. 30 matchup at N.C.
State.

And they’ ve done that in one
of the more difficult stretches of
the season, playing highly re-
garded UNC Greensboro (1-4 L,
OT),N.C. State (0-1 L, OT), Geor-
gia (0-1 L, OT), UNC Charlotte
(0-0 T, OT), and UNC Asheville
(1-2 L), in addition to ever-dan-
gerous conference rival Furman
(2-1 W), and UT-Chattanooga (6-
0.W).

“Tt’s not just the defense.
We’ ve gotten better as the season’s
gone on,” coach Kevin Hundley
said. ‘“‘We’re comfortable taking
different roles, and it’s pleasing
that the team as a whole has really
worked to get better.”

“Our transition play has been
really good lately,” goalkeeper
Allison Noznesky continued. “I
feel like things have really crys-
tallized. It’s not a case of can we
do it (shutout the oppostition), but
am I going to havea bad break day
where the ball rolls through my
legs or something.”

Despite their improved play,
the (2-4-1) record in those games
has left the team frustrated.

“We're starting to play really
well together but we’re not get-
ting wins. You feeI’o much better
when you go back and you’ve
won,” sweeper Katherine
Cornelius said. “It’s tiring to con-
tinue to go home and say we lost,
or we tied.”

“We have to go into games

confident we will score even if we
haven’t been scoring. We have to
keep on shooting and trying, and
we have to keep up our defense all
over the field. I wish there was
some magic key.”

Even if the Wildcats haven’t
been able to find that magic key
against non-conference foes, they
have woninconference. That trend
continued against Furman on
Wednesday night under the
Richardson Field lights.

“Tt was a good hard game, and
both teams played well,” Furman
coach Brian Lee said. “It was im-
portant because we’d slipped up
and lost two already. Now all they
(Davidson) have to dois beat Geor-
gia Southern (at home this Satur-
day) and they win (conference).”

After five minutes, both teams
had engineered a shot, but then
Davidson took over the game. They
held the Paladins without a shot for
the next 60 minutes while crank-
ing out 19 of their own.

Ginny Dye opened the scer-
ing in the 25th minute. Rhina Rob-
erts dropped a through ball behind
the defense, and Dye ran onto it.
She collected it, and touched it past
onrushing Paladin keeper Jen
McNutt.

Midway through the second
half, Roberts carried the ball into

the box, but had it knocked free by -

a hard tackle. It popped to Dye
who was taken down, and the Wild-
cats were awarded a penalty kick.
Amy Kanoff deposited it in the
right side of the goal for a 2-0
cushion.

The Paladins struck back off
Liz Bielefeld’s re-start ftom the
left flank in the 73rd minute. She
hit a high knuckling shot that froze
Noznesky and slipped into the back
side of the goal. But, the defense

stifled all other Furman attacks to
hold on for the 2-1 win.

“Furman is a big rival, and
this was the last conference game

in the first round. It makes a state-

ment to win,” Dye said. “We prob-
ably could’ ve finished a few more
chances, but we’re still undefeated
in conference which was our goal.”

But, the scoring problems re-
surfaced Friday against UNCA.
The Wildcats outshot the Bulldogs
20-8, but fell 2-1.

“T thought it was one of our
better games as far as playing at-
tractively,” Hundley said. “Wecre-

ated some of our better scoring | |
opportunities, and they-came off |’,
good plays as opposed to their’
mistakes or luck. Our ees P
just let us down.”

at one.

Men run well in N. C. Cross Country Championships

By AARON Dtinniana

The men’s cross country team
continued its recent success Satur-
day afternoon at the N.C. Intercol-
legiate Championships in Char-
lotte. Although the Wildcat run-
ners finished 12th among 13 teams
competing in the Green Division,
the team still turned ‘in a strong
performance:

Fifteen Davidson runners

competed in re race, the most in
coach Gary Andrew’s:11-yearten-
ure.

Josh Cookson led the team
with a third-place overall finish,
posting the third fastest time
(26:01) ever by a Davidson harrier
on the McAlpine-Greenway
course. The next four finishers for
the Wildcats were freshmen Will-
iam Isenhour, Brent Ferrell, Victor
Tailbird, and Pat Burchett.

Three of those runners.

(Isenhour, Fertell, and Tailbird).
joined Cookson on the all-time

Davidson performance list with
their times on Saturday. Andrew
attributed the good times to the flat
McAlpine-Greenway course.

“After running on hilly
courses, we had some pretty fast
times,” he said. “We would have
done better in the standings on a
hilly course, but the guys ran great.
I’m really happy.”

“The flat course gave us a lot

of confidence and was a lot more’
fon, ; aided Isenhour. “Everybody. ' ;
is improving.” *

Duke took first in the race, ‘
followed by Western Carolina. |”

With this week’s Alumni In-
vitational in doubt, the next race \
for Davidson will likely, be at the
Southern Conference Champion- ,
ships at Western Carolina in two:
weeks. The top nine runners on
Saturday will represent Davidson
cat the final meet.
