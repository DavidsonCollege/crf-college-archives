As Union director Smith received the Alumni Service Medal, where,
atthe award ceremonies, college officials said of his ability to “use alight
touch to get to serious things,” that he was able to give students
something extra.

Smith said in a 1990 interview with the Davidson Journal, “I always
-wanted to do something for students. I just didn’t know what would
come ofit. Ireally enjoyed not having to discipline and not having to give
grades.”

Smith often said of the students of the Union,” coming to the Union
fora burger and having a life-changing experience. Looking forabridge
partner and finding a partner for life.”

Smith received a master’s degree from UNC-Chapel Hill, and was
past president of the Association of Collegé Unioiis-International who,

would receive for their work.

These ‘monitors’ would report
violations of the policy to an Alco-
hol Enforcement Committee com-
posed of five members: an admin-
istrator (the Dean of Students or
his designate), a faculty member
from a pool of five appointed by
the President, and three students
from a pool of eighteen appointed
by the PCC and SGA.

This committee would handle
all violations of the Davidson
College alcohol policy. The pol-
icy also calls for the committee to
report its decisions on a monthly
basis in The Davidsonian.

Davidson College did nothave
an alcohol policy until 1988, but
drafted one in that year because of
the change in the state drinking
age. Since then the climate in the
Trustees and faculty has changed
because of increasing evidence of
alcohol abuse on campus.

The second draft list eight ac-

tions that need to be taken “to
change both the drinking patterns
and the social milieu.” They are:
1)Baker Sports Complex should
remain open (including the equip-
ment room) from 7 a.m. until 12
midnightsevendaysaweek. There
should be provisions for planned
activities at the sports complex on
a regular basis.

2)The 900 Room should provide a
relaxed, creative recreational at-
mosphere for snacks as well as
drinks. The hours for this service
should be kept sacrosanct.

3)The dining service should pro-
vide regular hours late at night in
the Vail Commons from 12-2 a.m.
each night. -

4)The College Union should be
open twenty-four hours a day with
limited Snack Bar service until 2
a.m.

5)Immediate attention should be
given to building a College Union
or the renovation of Johnston to

provide a more appealing social
life for students.
6)A study of Davidson’s social
patterns and habits, the relation-
ship between drinking habits and
academic and co-curricular per-
formances, and a strategy for
changing the cultural norms of the
community should be undertaken
by “experts.”
7)The college’s social program
needs to take irifo account the
spontaneous, nature of students’
search for activities and social ex-
pression.
8)The creation of a joint planning
committee, composed of the Un-
ion Board and Patterson Court
social chairmen to plan campus-
wide events, needs to be organ-
ized.

Academic Dishonesty: A Sign of the Times?

(CPS) By Karen Neustadt
Fiercecompetition for jobsand
higher grades and poor leadership
models have created a fertile cli-

‘mate for cheating, say college and

university officials who are grap-
pling with new ways to deal with
an old problem.

Worried educators say some
of today;s college students, ex-
posed to a painful recession in a
get-rich-quick society and numbed
by scandals such as congressional
check-bouncing, are asking them-
selves: What’s wrong with cheat-
ing? -.

“* “Oneof thereasons that (cheat-
ing is) increasing is the perception
that the students’ future job oppor-
tunities are closely linked to how
will they perform in terms of
grades,” said Robert Dorff, faculty
senate chairman at North Carolina
State University.

“When pressure mounts, some
feel that pressure and respond by
cheating,” he said, adding that
today’s faculty membersare being
urged to be more creative with
testing procedures to make cheat-
ing “less enticing.”

Not only is academic dishon-
esty growing, but there is more
discussion about it than ever be-
fore. “Both of these forces are
coming together and making it a
more apparent problem,” _Dorff
said.

One New Jersey student
doesn’t see cheating as a problem.
In fact, he’s making a tidy profit
off of the current GPA paranoia.

Michael Moore, a Rutgers
University journalism ‘student,
recently raised eyebrows with his

* 86-page book, titled “Cheating 101:

The Benefits and Fundamentals of
Earning the Easy *A’,” that details
methods of cheating, including
hiding notes in the holes of torn
jeans and using foot signals to
convey answers on multiplechoice
questions.

Moore reported, in an article
in“CampusCrime”’(January 1992),
that he has sold 1,750 copies of his:
book ($6 each) to students at
Rutgers, the University of Mary-
land and Ohio State University.

reaction from the schools were not

into the light.

Educators often refuse toadmit
the amountof cheating that may be
going on in their classes, said one
source, and may not want to know
the hard facts.

In 1987 and 1988, the Ameri-
can Council on Education, in con-
junction with the University of
California at Los Angeles asked
students about their cheating hab-
its inacomprehensive survey, “The
American Freshman.”

About 37 percent of the stu-
dents surveyed in the fall of 1988

: said they had cheated.on.a test.in

highschool, an increase form about
30 percent the year before. About
57 percent said they had copied
another student’s work, while about
52 percent admitted doing so the
year before.

That was the last year any ref-
erence to cheating was included in
the survey.

“We don’t plan on bringing
them up (the questions) again,”
said Ellen Riggs, aresearcher with
the Higher Education Research
“The general

the most positive. Some advised
students not to answer the ques-
tions.”

Michael Moffatt, associate
professor of anthropology at
Rutgers University, said his inten-
sive study of cheating left him
shocked and “in a funk.” He said
he received only a lukewarm re-
sponse from his colleagues.

“T found that 33 percent (of
students) had been involved in
considerable cheating. Thatmeans
cheating in three to 25 courses
with an average of eight courses,
and 22 percent had never cheated
in ‘college. The ‘in-betweens’
cheated once or twice,” said Mof-
