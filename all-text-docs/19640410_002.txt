A Search For The Means ...

/

Some students submitted. But for
many others the Student Council-
Honor Court room search was con-
ducted in their absence and without
their knowledge.

The joint action bv Council and the
Court was prompted by the discovery
recently that nearly 800 volumes have
been missing from the college library
over the past two years. Student
Council first learned of the situation
after a search of dormitory rooms
during the Christmas holidays. Ac-
cording to Student Body President
John Spratt. “a sizable number” of
the missing books turned up in stud-
ents’ rooms.

That the Student Council and Hon-
or Court felt compelled to act is un-
derstandable. But even the loftiest
objectives do not justify the substi-
tution of expediency for proper pro-
cedure. The searchers simply used
that method which would recover the
most books in the shortest length of
time.

The blitzkrieg struck at a large
percentage of dormitory rooms on
campus. Whether or not the occupants
were present was given no considera-
tion. The goal had been set: missing
books were to be returned even if the
search involved .rummaging through
the rooms of students who were not
only innocent but also free of suspic-
ion.

Improper tactics have been charged
in the past. Last fall students were
worried “by the rumor that the Hon-
or Court planned to search all cars
and rooms for alcohol before Home-
coming.” Honor Court Chairman
Howard Arbuckle quashed the rumor
and defended the court in the Nov. 1,
1963 DAVIDSONIAN, although ad-
mitting that the court had no search
powers:

Arbuckle emphasized — that
court members are not policemen
sent out on periodic patrols—
even if they did have the authori-
ty to search rooms and cars. They
are not out to “get” anyone;
there never has been nor will be
“a big crack-down,” the court
does not feel it is -slack in its
duties if students are not oc-
casionally kicked out of school.

Only after suspicion has arisen
does the court attempt to dis-

Calling A Spade A.

Members of the Student Council
and Honor Court both take the same
oath that they “will be honor bound
to report any violation of the Honor
System or any other provision of the
Constitution which comes under
(their) observation ...” But the rule
the members of the two groups were
so intent on enforcing in their March
26 raid was not a student body regu-
lation or part of the honor system.
Rather they sought to enforce a facul-
ty regulation which levies “a fine of
one dollar for taking a book from the
library building without charging it
out on a circulation card.”

Part of the trouble the Student
Council and Honor Court are meeting
in the library book hullabaloo is a
direct result of the groups’ failure or
refusal to recognize the problem for
what it is—stealing.

cover possible violators of the
Honor Code or the Student Body
Regulations.

This excerpt raises several ques-
tions for the Honor Court chairman.
In November the Honor Court rep-
resentative made no claim to the right
to search automobiles or rooms.
Nevertheless the “right” was dogged-
ly asserted in the March 26 raid. Fac-
ulty regulations mention searches at
only one point—in reserving ‘the
right to search anv vehicle on th
Davidson Campus.” The Student Body
Constitution carries no provisions for
room and automobile searches. Do
the Honor Court and Student Council
assume this “right’’?

Almost half the rooms on- the
campus were searched for books: had
the individual occupants of each of
the rooms searched attracted suspic-
ion to themselves? No, rather half the
community was harassed by an at-
tempt to locate a few guilty parties.

We oppose indiscriminate searches
such as that conducted: March 26. We
do not relish the thought of searches
of any nature. And yet, we admit that
in certain situations, such as the li-
brary problem, a search is the only
answer. Realizing this fact, we urge
that steps be taken to protect individ-
ual rights and to prevent abuse of the
innocent.

The rights and duties of the Honor
Court. and Student Council with re-
gard to searches should be clearly
stated in the Student Body Constitu-
tion. In addition, guidelines should be
established for conducting searches.
These basic rules should be printed
in the Wildcat Handbook in the same
manner as the Honor Court trial pro-
cedure.

Stipulations should include:

@ No room may be searched un-
less one—preferably all—occupants
are present,

@ No room shall be searched at an
unreasonable hour.

@ The area involved and the ob-
ject sought shall be carefully stipulat-
ed prior to the search.

@ No search will be permitted un-
less there is a reasonable basis for

suspicion.

and is caught, he is fined one dollar.
Only when an attempt is made to re-
move the college’s identifying marks
does the Honor Court consider a theft
to have been committed.

What value does a book have?
Surely the value, for the most part,
lies in the information it provides, in
the service it offers. Anyone who in-
tentionally removes a book without
the permission of the library is appro-
priating the use and, consequently,
the value of the volume for himself.
There can be little doubt that this
fulfills the definition of stealing—
“to take or appropriate without per-
mission, dishonestly, or unlawfully,
especially in a secret or surreptitious
manner.”

The intentional, unauthorized re-
moval of volumes from the library is
in direct violation of the Honor Sys-
tem. Justice demands not only mercy
and understanding but also firmness.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Tilley Claims Moving
Vital In Prof’s Career

Dear Editor:

In a letter of the DAVID.
SONIAN for 13 March _ Bill
Ferris questioned the departure
of several members of the Dav-
idson faculty. I wish to reply to
Mr. Ferris's letter, for though
I think he is to be admired for
his concern—and to be com-
mended for raising questions—
I also think he is mistaken in
his reasoning and in his facts.

The mistake of reasoning—a
post hoc ergo propfer hoc—lies
in concluding. from the depar-
ture of professors critical of the
College, that their criticisms
brought about their departures.
The conclusion does not follow.
Many quite critical professors
have remained at Davidson for
years; I am sure that the Ad-
ministration considers their cri-
ticism indispensable—as of
course it is.

The mistake of fact lies in
Mr. Ferris’s phrase, ‘conflicts
with the Administration.’’ I am.
not aware of conflicts between
the Administration and myself.
(1 believe that only one of the
professors Mr. Ferris mention-
ed entered into such conflict.)
What Mr. Ferris seems to over-
look, and what may not be ap-
parent to many students, is that
moving plays a large part in
academic careers.

Two years ago I knew almost
nothing about small colleges.
I came to Davidson—of whose
very existence I had previously
been unaware—to examine a
small rural college for myself.
I have Jearned a great deal, and
I have had a truly delightful
time; but I never intended to
stay more than a few years, and
as it turns out two years must
be long enough.

So much has been said of cri-
ticism lately that I should like
to make my own position clear.

I never contemplated staying.

permanently at Davidson, be-
cause (among other reasons) it
is a men’s college: it is rurally
situated; and its library is not
suitable for research. These are
not criticisms, but facts. They
are objections, not to Davidson,
but to my staying at Davidson—

and these are quite different
things.

It is true that I have some
criticisms of Davidson—who
does not? It is true that I should
like to have done more at Dav-
idson than I have been able to
do. If I had been able to do
more, I should gladly have
Stayed for a year or two longer.
But I have not been able to
make the contribution I wished
to make; there is much to be
done in the academic world: it
is best from every point of view
that I depart.

Meanwhile the obvious reason
for the departures Mr. Ferris
mentions is the promotion of
academic careers. I suspect
that nearly every one of the
professors on Mr. Ferris’s list
left Davidson for a_ higher
salary, a more responsible posi-
tion, a more congenial kind of
teaching, or a more prestigious
institution, (The same motives
bring other professors to Dav-
idson.)

In general, and despite many
exceptions, the more desirable
an academician seems, the
more likely he is to depart. This
may seem unfortunate: but ex-
cept for places like Harvard,
Chicago, and California it is the
way of the academic world.

The right question, then. is
not, Who leaves? but, Who
stays? For if the general level
of its faculty is maintained, a
few departures will not change
Davidson College.

_AN URCHIN'S WAY,

Honest Expression In Sex

BY DUNCAN DO. NEWCOMER

The Sex Revolution—like the Industrial Revolution
—is late in the South, but hardly from a lack of natural

resources. Rather the Bible
South’s chastity belt.

How long. how long will the
old citadels of piety withstand
the new crisis of passion? Not
long at all if piety and passion
are felt to be mutually exclu-
sive.

Sex—as Seripts ‘n Pranks edi-
tor-emeritus Hank Ackerman
says—is being demythologized.
The myth that the virgin bride
is the only bride is felt by many
to be as irrelevant to love and
marriage as the myth of the
Virgin Mary is to knowing
Christian love. The myth that
sex is only for baby-making be-
gan to falter about the time bi-
planes went out and D. H. Law-
rence came in preaching that
love—all facets—was the salva-
tion of man, And the Freudian
myth that sex expression is in-
nately good and repression na-
turally bad went out when the

honest Radcliffe sophomore
said something about feeling
guilty.

As the myths fall new mean-
ing is found in sex. Our genera-
tion is the demythologizer; our
generation is the discoverer.
This is good. It is our contridu-
tion to society.

Our generation’s approach

to sex is good, for if is hon-
est. There is no sham when

Belt has long served as the

today’s student says sex musf-

be a part of a real relation-

ship. To us sex must be a

meaningful expression of the
whole, homogenized person—

body and spirif. To us sex Is

mutual discovery of self, a
way among ways of being.

Sex is part of the identity

crisis and to it our generation

applies as an ethic the virtues
of self-awareness and the
vices of selfishness. Our view
of sex is good because we see

sex as part of life—not a
third-floor, dark-room, thrill.

Sex as expression involves
the possibilities of virtue and
vice. For it is subject to the
general ethic of all self-expres-
sion—honesty and beauty. It in-
volves more than self and is
subject to the ethic of mutuality
—consideration and concern.

Sex is an easy escape. Yet
when sex is lived by the ethic of
concern then it becomes a dif-
ficult path .to living, a path
worth. its rewards.

The citadels of piety need not
fear the crisis in passion. For
passion. is a part of the whole
man and our gencration wants
it as such. Sex as an assertion,
of being is no challenge to
piety.

U. S. Foreign Policy For Cuba:
Flexible Reality And Hard Myth

BY MICHAEL L. HARRINGTON

It takes no expert to observe that the world situation can change and does
change very rapidly in a few years and even in a few

Luis Manrara, Executive Di-
tweotor and President of the
Truth About Cuba Committee,
urged that the United States
adopt the so-called ‘‘hard line’
policy of total economic bdlock-
ade and recognition of a rival
government-in-exile toward the
present Cuban Communist gov-
ernment.

Senator William Fulbright
has recognized a changed
world situation and charged
that. the United States was fail-
ing to adapt,so the new condi-
tions by ‘‘clinging to old myths
in the face of new realities.’’

The failure of the Cuban pro-
fessional classes to protest and
resist the murder of constitu-
tional democracy by Batista in
1952, and then to discern and
reject Communism under Cas-
tro in 1959, was well-noted by
Manrara. And Manrara’s ‘‘mea
culpa”’ could be a delicate warn-
ing to politically secure persons
everywhere in the Western
Hemisphere.

American foreign policy to-
wards Cuba must be acknowl-

edged a failure if its end was
to eliminate Communism in
Cuba. The invasion attempt,
which failed so ignominously at
the Bay of Pigs for lack of an
air cover, showed the United
States obviously committed in
the eyes of everyone except its
UN representative and top of-
ficials, engaging in denials and
double-talk as ridiculous as that
practiced by Fidel Castro af-
firming-denying his Communist
affiliations. It is evident now
that the trade blockade of Cuba
has fallen apart, in some degree
due to U.S. inconsistency.

While the reasons for the fail-
ure of our military intervention
and trade embargo are many
and varied, it nonetheless re-
mains that: American foreign
policy has failed to make one
jota of progress in ridding Cu-
ba of Communism.

Senator Fulbright rightfully
suggests a third alternative of
wary co-existence with Cuba.

Manrara, gets his worst grade
in claiming that there is neith-

months.

er individuation or difference in
the Communist bloc. He might
have meant that Communism is
ultimately concerned with world
domination, but this at best is
only a superficial analysis. The
lecturer equated the policies of
Lenin, Stalin, and Krushchev
as being one in the same and
denounced the present Sino-So-
viet rift as being a transparent
hoax.

What Manrara missed, is that
Communism has been a mask
for Russian imperialism in
Eastern Europe and a mask for
Chinese imperialism in Asia.
These two brands of imperial-
ism, seemingly the same on the
surface, have finally come into
conflict because of fundamen-
tally different immediate ob-
jectives.

It is quite possible that in
time the Soviet Union will modi-
fy its imperialistic ambitions
and that Communist Cuba will
evolve into a different state
from its present one. And the
United States must be prepared
for both eventualities.

Russian Uses Soft-Talk On
Young Wildcat Capitalists

(Editor’s note: From Swe-
den, Lonnroth attends David-
son on a Richardson Scholar-
ship.)

BY JONAS LONNROTH

In spite of his somewhat ted-
ious chapel talk Secretary
Anatoli Myshkob from the So-
viet Embassy was to me one of
the most interesting personali-
ties that. have visited the cam-
pus this year and certainly the
most exotic one intellectually.
As when a minister speaks, it
was hard to know what to be-
lieve and what not to believe.

In addition to his appeasing
words, his manners were those
of an expert snow bird. Most ob-
vious were his repeated grop-
ings for words that he did not
need. Of course, this could also
have been his Young Pioneer
spirit to learn as much as pos-
sible.

One of the purposes of having
an embassy is to spread good
will, and Myshkob's endeavor
to do this was about as perfect
as I have ever heard a
Communist make. But his
office prevenied him from real-
ly showing the aggressive side
of a red among blues,

Perhaps it would take invit-
ing an American Communist to
campus to have somebody pre-
sent the red-hot arguments
against western capitalism of
today and yesterday, and dem-
onstratively dump God and
Private Property on the same
garbage-heap. Whatever one’s
purpose is, I think it-is of vital
importance that Western stud-
ents be confronted with the ap-
parent jungle of Marxist-Lenin-
ist thinking. It is frustrating and
fascinating, also a little con-
tagious.

We all hear a lot about Com-
mies and Comsymps but until
presented a real live specimen
we won't have a chance to know

LIKE Rocks.

the thoughts and facts that form
the mental foundation for the
Communists here and abroad.

The American right-wingers
and many anti-communist pro-
pagandists, such as the Cubans
that were here Tuesday night
‘in spite of all their “research,”
certainly do not provide a sat-
isfactory analysis.

To sum up, having had a
Barchelon-type Communist, it
would be a kick to see another
Scriven, not a blue-eyed blond
one, but one dipped in red, air
his views in the otherwise stale
political climate on campus.

If we are really lucky, some-
body might even form a little
Marxist clique so that the world
would be represented more
evenly in Davidson. Think of
all the nice, everlasting de-
bates we could have, Perhaps
even some of our freshman
friends would be motivated
enough to show up. Yep. that
would be fun.
