By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

Davidson College named Bo
Brickels as its new head

hours after former mentor
Terry Holland resigned.
The announcement was
made informally by college
president Samuel R. Spencer

Brickels, who had served for
five years under Holland as

he can do the job.”’

That Brickels has the sup-
port of the team was eviden-
ced Wednesday afternoon
when they voted unanimously
in favor of him at a team
meeting.

“It has been a long time and
I was beginning to wonder if I
was ever going to get the chan-
ce to do the iob.”” commented

the silver-haired coach. ‘‘This
game has been my life and my
dream has always been to be
the head coach.”’

But Brickels was quick,
even during this highly
emotional period, to express
his gratitude and appreciation
for the opportunity to have
served under Holland.

“It was really a fortunate
experience to have worked for
Terry,’’ Brickels said. ‘‘He is
a great guy as well as coach. It
has just been a super’ five
years.”’

He continued by saying that
Jim Larranaga will stay on
and continue as an assistant
here. Brickels praised
Larranaga is presently away
termed the school ‘‘very tor-
tunate’’ to have him.
Llarranaga is presently away
on recruiting assignments.

Speaking of recruiting,
Brickels mentioned that ‘‘we
are very close to signing some
people that will really help our
program."’

Brickels spoke of his hap-
piness regarding the op-
portunity to be a headcoach.
But he said that it was more
than just being the man at the
top.

“It is really something that
every coach dreams of and I
am no exception,”’ he said. ‘I
am not sure what it is like."

“I have been waiting for the
chance. Seven years under
other -people is a long time.
Sometimes you wonder if it is
going to pass you by.”’

Brickels also considered the
fact that most schools are.
going for younger men in
coaching. At many times, this
had raised more apprehension
in his thinking.

B:t he has forgotten, at
least temporarily, all the
anxieties that came before his
appointment. ‘“‘It is just a
great opportunity and I am
just overwhelmed that the
college has accepted me,”’
Brickels stated.

But one of the influential
factors that made him certain
that this is the place where he
really wanted to be a head
coach was the _ people
associated with the program
here, especially the players
whom he was instrumental in
recruiting.

_ “The people here have
made me enthusiastic,’’ he
claimed. ‘“They made me cer-
tain that this was the place for
me. We have guys that want to
play and want to win. I really
feel that I know them and that
is very important for a team.”

Brickels is a native of the
Midwest, but considers this to
be Lome.

‘‘T have the greatest respect
for the college and its of-
ficials,”’ Brickels pointed out.
“This is a super place to live
and I certainly did not want to
leave. This is home.”

Brickels will begin his new
duties immediately, but will
continue with the important
task of recruiting first.

Student Self-Study Report

By BRUCE CORSER
Managing Editor

The student component of
the once-per-decade _ In-
stitutional Self-Study of
Davidson College is now com-
plete and in the hands of the
faculty.

Written by the Self-Study
Committee of Students, the 33-
page report was prepared at
the request of the faculty
Steering Committee for a
comprehensive ‘‘set of
analyses and recom-
mendations concerning those
facets of college life to which
students can bring a unique
perspective.”

The report is based on
general guidelines which the
Steering Committee
suggested as being worthy of
evaluation. These guidelines
were then subdivided into
more specific topics and
assigned to individual com-
mittee members.

Aided by the responses to
questions contributed to a
master (84 per-
cent of the total distributed
were returned) and individual
research, each member wrote
up an analysis of their area of
concentration.

The student committee as a
whole then reviewed each in-
dividual report deciding which
recommendations it felt were
warranted. These recom-
mendations and suges

As a result of this review,
Blain Butner, SGA president
and an editor of the student
report, observed that ‘‘the en-
tirety of our document is a
consensus of at least a
majority of the committee.”’

History and Purpose, Students
and Student Government.

Butner noted that the Com-
mittee of Students ‘tried to
cover every area and issue
which needs to be evaluated or
changed. However, because of
the scope of the entire Self-
Study, we were unable to
analyze in depth everything

The report itself will even-
tually be incorporated as a
part of the faculty’s Self-Study
and will aid the Steering Com-
mittee in its deliberations.

Following is a summary of
some of the more significant
recommendations.

In the realm of educational
program, the Committee Of
Students recommended that
Davidson examine the of-
ferings of various calendar
structures and determine and
implement the one most ap-
propriate for the College.

STUDENT COMMITTEE
Mark Connors--Counseling and Advising
Pat Morgan--Student/Faculty/
Administration Relations

Alec Hoon--Publications

Jim Goodloe--Stadent Government

Dubose Porter--Honor System, Hearing
Committee

John Hornickel--Governance

Blain Butner--Chairman

Eric Wather--Editor

Katie Early--Security, Health Care, Athletics
Women Students

The report also advocated
that the P.E. requirement for
graduation be evaluated to

determine its function and
worth to students.

The Committee recom-
mended that the Drop/Add
period be extended to five
weeks on a trial basis. Also the
analysis maintained that em-
phasis be shifted away from
the single. three-hour
examination as a final and

major evaluation of a
student's capabilities.
For exceptional par-

ticipation in non-academic ac-
tivities the committee ad-
vising awarding credit so as to

encourage students to seek in-
extra-

volvement in
curriculars.

Another recommendation
concerned the need to update
the advisement procedures
and personnel in the pre-
professional areas.

The student portion of the
self-study noted that the
Davidson student should be

faculty meeting this week.

The grading proposal calling for the deletion of a failing
grade from the grade point average computation once the
course has been repeated and passed was defeated by such
a wide margin that it is unlikely that it will come up for con-
sideration again within the next two vears.

free to set up a study abroad
program in any college or
university in the world that is
academically creditable. Also
an equitable grading system
and course credit transfers
from foreign study should be
instituted. According to the
report the expansion of the
scope of international studies
should include the option of a
sophomore year abroad
program.

Another significant recom-
mendation related that the
requirement for awarding
faculty tenure on the basis of a
professed Christian faith be
abolished. However, in order
to maintain a _ church-
relatedness, there should be
an increased emphasis on
those organizations based on a
Christian stewardship such as
the YM/YWCA.
