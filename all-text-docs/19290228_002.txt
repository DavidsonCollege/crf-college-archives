A Vovational Guidance

Just at this time when stress is
being laid upon the choice of one’s
life work there may be a monotony
caused by frequent repetition of in-
vitations and exhortations to attend
the meetings held for the benefit of
every college man and to apply for
interviews with these prominent
men who are being brought here
one considers that there are approxi-
through the Y. M. C. A. But when
mately one hundred and fifty men in
the student body who are undecded
as to the manner in which they shall
spend their lives, and when one sur-
mises that another large group has
stated a preference toward a certain
vocation and is wavering between
choices, the great importance of the
movement may be recognized.

The Vocational Guidance Insti-
tute has.come to play a great part
in American institutions throughout
the country and Davidson’s ranks
with the very best of them. . When
it is seen that an entire month is
devoted to the enterprise, and when
one notes that the foremost men in
their respective fields in the South
are secured to guide the men in their
considerations, the magnitude of the
enterprise is evident.

Our purpose in speaking of this
movement is to stress the importance
of a whole-hearted response on the
part of the student body. Hear these
men; confer with them privately;
and let them help each man deter-
mine the best use of ‘his life.

PATHWAYS

A tendency to leave the walks
and make new paths over the cam-
pus on the part of nearly every up-
perclassman is proving “ruinous to
the grass as it is gaining its ver-
dency. True that the mudwalks are
disagreeable during rainy weather,
but new paths should be cut with
hesitation and perhaps there might
be a disposition to replace the pres-
ent ‘pathways with concrete walks—
unless there be the fear that the
natural beauty of the campus be des-
troyed. Anyway, those returning
from the evening movie might use
the walks instead of widening and
deepening the path from the church
‘to Phi Hall.

THE FACULTY SCORES

Appreciation for the splendid en-
tertainment afforded by the Faculty
in honor of the Senior Class and
guests last week-end was voted by
the honored group, in the form of
a resolution, but-we want to ex-
‘press here not only approval and ap-

" preciation but also the hope that the
affair be made an annual event—if
the Faculty be so disposed. Suchy

- a great success as the affair proved

a continuance of the custom and call
for a unanimous response by the
underclassmen if they are so favor-
ed.

AN AWARD FOR SERVICE

The New York Southern Society
has designated Davidson College as
one of the fifteén institutions where-
inthe Algernon Sydney Sullivan
Award established in honor of the
president, may be
made, The award consist of a bronze

Society’s first

placque, a suitably engraved certi-
ficate, and a volume on the life
of Mr. Sullivan. It may be bestow-
ed annually upon one man of the
erating class and those who re-
ceive it “shall have demonstrated
their worthiness to typify that spirit

gt.) of brotherly love which. was the cor-

nerstone of the life of Mr. Sulli-

Cane:

The object of the New York
Southern Society in establishing this
award, which was awarded for the
first time at last Commencement,
is to perpetuate the influence of a
life which exemplifies the highest
type of manhood and to enccurage
in others the characteristics which
made Algernon Sydney Sullivan be-
loved of all who knew him. The
award is based on a quality which is
described as a “desire to he of ser-
vice, to help our fellows in combat-
ing the daily problems of life.”

Interest in the success of this ef-
fort to raise the standard of com-
munity life can but express our ap-
preciation for the opportunity thus
provided by the Southern Society
whereby Davidson may conier re-
cognition upon those men who, in
generous unselfishness consistently
contribute to the uplift and better-
ment of humanity.

The award, further information
concerning which may be obtained
in the Library, will be made at Com-
mencement.

PUTTING THE SPEAKING
BACK INTO JUNIOR
SPEAKING

Following the Senior Class revel-
ty by exactly a month comes the
Junior’s turn to celebrate their col-
legiate position with the traditional
Junior Speaking.

Upper-classmen remember that
they have heard a rumor to the ef-
fect that in years gone by it was
compulsory for every junior to make
a speech for the occasion and that
the winner was the king of the day.
But within the time in which: the
present members of the student body
have been here, this custom of com-
pelling the junior to make a speech
has been changed to forcing him to
make a cash donation.

Consequently the oratorical con-
test within the class has been chang-
ed to an effort for each successive
class to attempt to spend more
money than the one before. But
within the past two years the juniors
have rebelled against this custom
and attempted to cut expenses and
build up the oratorical side of the
event. Last year there were four
juniors competing in the contest ;
the year before, three.

It s up to the present Junior class
to make as great a success of the
oratoricals as it does of its publi-
cation and social events. On ac-
count of the fact that there has been
an unusual number of social events
scheduled for the spring, Junior
Speaking will not be anticipated as a
social event so greatly as it has been
heretofore. The other activities of
the occasion should therefore have
a great deal of stress, so as to make
the week-end a success.

‘With the number of men in the
Junior Class who. have formerly
shown their interest in oratory there
should be a group large enough to
necessitate preliminaries for the con-
test,

to be certainly ought to encourage

WANTON WILES

By Dave Anderson

This week we look into the past—
to incidents during the infancy of Da-
vidson College.

When Davidson first opened, on Me

When Davidson first opened, on
March 1, 1837, tuition was fixed at
ten to fifteen dollars per session. The
price of board was $6 per month, and
stayed at that low figure for many
years. There were three small dormi-
tories accommodating a total of 48
students by putting four in a room.
But the ‘enrollement was 67, so the
overflow was permitted to build shacks
for their own use, with the privilege of
selling them at the end of their course.

The College was run for a while on
a Manual Labor system, by which all
the students were required to work,
and received from $9 to $15 per session
for three hours of work per day, This
system was discarded after about four
years’ trial, because of the unwilling-
ness of the students to do the required
work, and their pranks which retarded
the work. Many tools were broken
or hidden for the purpose of getting a
temporary rest from work. One story
goes that, since the workers were en-
titled to come home when the bell rang,
they tied a pig to the bell-rope and
gave him just enough corn to keep him
busy until they were safely at work.
Then the pig did the rest.

On one occasion in about 1848 a ram
was caught and placed on the chapel
rostrum. One of the professors en-
tered, and on seeing the ram turned
to leave. But the ram had large horns
and knew how to use them, so the pro-
fessor was ejected rather hurriedly.

In 1854 a serious break occurred be-
tween the faculty and students. A dis.
turbance was raised one night on ac-
count of some assigned math problems
that were almost impossible for thein
to work. When the three professors,
who composed the faculty, approached
to determine the cause, they were met
with a shower of stones. One of the
professors, Major Hill, a graduate of
West Point and‘ an officer in the Mexi-
can War, routed the students when he
displayed his Mexican sword. One
student was suspended as a result, but
the others protested the action, Fail-
ing to reach any agrement, and not
liking the discipline required by Major
Hill, many of the students left collere
not to return. But the institution was
unshaken and the regular curriculum
was continued with apparently no in-
terruption. :

But speaking of exams and com-
mencement, the students were all re-
quired for several years to stand an
oral examination before the Board.
And commencement took place the
second week of August. Maybe they
were the good old days, but give me

written exams, if necessary, and June
first.

DR. MARTIN

The Charlotte Observer: The name
of Dr. W. J. Martin .president of Da-
vidson College, figured twice in the
Paper last week. The first time was in
connection with his retirement from the
active duties as president of that in-
stitution. He has made request at the
commencement last June that he be
relieved of the burdens of the presi-
dency and this request had come up
for action at the regular mid-winter
}meeting of the trustees. The reluc-
tance of the board to enact sevérance
ofthese relations was manifested
in its determination to hold
his services as a member of the fac-
ulty, meantime giving him a year's
leave of absence that he might benefit
by a tour of Europe. Dr. Martin has
not only seen Davidson College “come
back,” but he was an important factor
in the renaissance. It was through his
influence that many large donations
have gone into the Davidson treasury
and that the “enabling acts” through
which the college was rehabilitated
after destruction of Chambers Hall
were established. Dr. Martin has en-
gineered Davidson College into em-
ployment of the best days in its his-
tory. He has helped it to reach the
crest of the hill and to a forging for-
ward on level ground. Dr. Martin, as
official and as man, is held in high
esteem not only by the Davidson of-
ficials and student body, but by a host
of college friends scattered all over the
South,

In spite of the astronomical dimen-
of the Rockefeller, Ford and
modern fortunes, some of the
ancients had an amount of wealth not
at all to be sneezed at. For example,
take Croesus, king of Lydia, Nobody
knows how rich he was. But his name
became synonymous with fabulous
riches. An idea of his wealth may be
gained from the account in Herodotus
on the propitiatory offering he sent to
theeoracle at Delphi to get a favorable
prognosis for a war he intended to
wage against the Persians. H is bid for
success consisted of a pyramid of 117
bricks of solid gold, weighing 400
pounds apiece. The whole was sur-
mounted by a golden lion weighing 800
pounds. In addition, there was a col-
lection of bowls of gold, silver, neck-
laces and money. At present-day cal-
culations the total value of this gift to
the gods amounted to $200,000,000. But,
apparently, it wasn’t enough; for Cro-
esus did not obtain the victory’ he
craved. Certain of Croesus’ relatives
seem to have been quite as well off as
he himself. Pythius, one of his dis-
tant kin, is pictured as giving Xerxes
a token of his esteem in the form of
money to the amount of $24,000,000.
When Xerxes hesitated, Pythius as-
sured him that it were a mere trifle
that he happened to have on hand.
Solomon} in whose days “silver was as
dross” in Jerusalem, had an income
equivalent to $20,000,000 a year, which
puts the Hebrew king in the Ford
class. Diodorus estimates the wealth
of the Pharaoh Rameses IIT at $10,-
000,000,000 in the buying values of this
day. So, if the poor were always with
us, the rich were not far behind.

Contemporary Thought

KEEPING IN TOUCH

McGill Daily: As men get on in
years they tend to grow grey and con-
sort with only the few select cronies
who have drifted down the same long
path of years.

So the older students in any univer-
sity tend to herd together and lose in-
terest in those who are springing up
around them to follow in their foot-
steps for better or for worse as they
are guided by the example of the old-
er men.

This superior attitude of the senior
in the college is due to no real fault
on his part. It is due to a negative
rather than a positive quality. He
stands apart and awaits the younger
man to make his bow. Often as not
the younger man is so obsessed with
his new surroundings that he fails to
notice the senior, or again the fresh-
man sees the older man as a hero who
has passed examinations year after
year and as one wrapped in a halo of
loftier air. Thus in awe the freshman
stands aside to let the senior pass and
regards him as one in another world
who is not interested in the fresh-
man’s affairs, his tribulations and his
victories. a

Now this is all wrong. The fresh-
man must learn to regard his senior
as a brother in arms, who has served

Frank Hall.

a term and is ready to ‘give a little ad-

vice gleaned in the vale of trials. The
senior must make up for the fresh-
man’s reticence and welcome with a
ready smile, which may be tinged with
the paternal feeling.

At any rate the senior cannot af-
ford to miss meeting the freshman and
the freshman must not fail to meet the
senior. For the sad thing about col-
lege life is that the lads have their day
and all too soon become seniors, a
few among a swarm of mere boys
fresh from the preparatory schools.
These latter engulf the scene of the
senior’s earlier exploits. The seniors
stand aloof, fall out of the old accus-
tomed ways, and leave the ancient
halls of learning feeling that in their
last year their Alma Mater has grown
away from them and that never more
shall exist that feeling of harmony
once so strongly filled their hearts.
So passes the senior a sadder and a
wiser man, disillusioned, wondering if
it was all worth while. Of course it
was, but that attitude of mind will
never make a boasting graduate or one
who will come back-to revisit the uni-
versity in after, years.

Why? Because he grew apart from
the ivy-clad walls before he was
forced to leave. ‘The illusion of being
cherished by the Alma Mater was dis-
pelled, He left alone. Why should
he return—also alone?
