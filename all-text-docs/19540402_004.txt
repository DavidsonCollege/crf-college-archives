SENIOR SKETCH No. 4

Finklea:

By BILL MOFFETT

When the faithful unfolded their
Dally Workers one Friday morning
three weeks ago, they found on
the front page a letter answering
the current subscription drive. Un-
signed, it read in part as follows:

“We are students in a small
southern college whose policies are
determined by contributions from
Wall Street imperialists and re-
actionary religious fanatics who,
under the guise of liberal educa-
tion, seek to cram down our
throats policies and practices of
decadent American imperialism—
all in the name of liberty.

“Everyday we fair-minded and
peace-loving youths of America are
being impressed by the Pentagon
puppets and Wall Street war-
mongers into the Army to serve

as instruments of imperialistic ag-| .

gression...

“Your journalistic truths are dis-
played only sporadically by our
fascist librarian who seeks to de-
prive us of the true benefits of
the free press .

“We hope our ione subscription
has aided your valiant efforts to
spread the Real Truth.”

Through outstanding work on
the part of Davidsonien reporters,
it was revealed today that the
author of this bold letter was none
other than Jack Finklea of Fior-
ence, Gouth Carolina, presently a
settiior at Davidson College!

When confronted with this
amaiing discovery by a member of

Commissar of Cell 69, “I stand

Communist Party at Davidson, “Cell
60, is definitely growing by leaps
and bounds. “There’s a terrific
dissatisfaction and unrest among
the workers.”

“But,” continued a _ reporter,
“How can you have a legitimate
workers’ cell? Isn’t it true that
your members come exclusively
from the upper bourgeoise?”

Finklea vehemently denied this
accusation, declaring that “Com-
rades like Ralph Maynard give our
cell an indisputably proletarian
complexion.”

He admitted that meetings of
Cell 69 have for some time been
held in the Polynesian Room of
Hattie’s Grill. Although refusing
to divulge the procedures of the
gatherings, Finklea said that the
members joined in reading to-
the faculty’s Un-American Activ-
ities Committee, the bleary-eyed
Finklea replied adamantly, “I stand
behind the fifth.”

Later, in an exclusive interview,
Finklea told reporters that the

gether from “the works of our be-
loved fathers in the faith, Marx
and Lenin.”

“We have great hopes for the
future,” he continued. “Already
plans are being made for a gigantic
peoples rally on May first. Com-
rade Crisp will deliver the special
address to the cement pourers at
the new dorm construction, and I
will lead the Peace Parade to the
library—that magnificent’ debris of
artistic fossils—efor a demonstra-
tion against the tyrannical boys on
the spreading of Real Truth by our
Russian brothers.”

Proudly gloating over the suc-
cess of the new organization in
forcing the resignation of Dean
John C. Bailey, Jr., whom he re-
ferred to os “that notorious sup-
pressor of student opinion,” Fink-
lea indicated that bigger and bet-
ter things are to be expected from
Cell 69.

“Comrades, unite! We have the
whole world to gain; we have only
our diplomas to lose.”

should and can be made with the

Cothmunists and that American in-
tervention is not absolutely neces-
sary; secondly, they will assert
that we cannot possibly attempt to
hold the line against Communist
forces all over. the world, and that
the security of Indochina is not so
vital to us that we should send
American forces to that theater.

I submit that the second argu-
ment proceeds on false premises,
and I believe that any military
analyst of the day would agree
that Indochina is a vital position
in our defensés against Communist
expansion. With full position of
Indochina the Communists could
easily move westward into weak
Thailand, and thus menace Burma
and India; and they would have a
spearhead into the Southwestern
Pacific area, which Includes
Malaya (which already is ex-
periencing a great deal of trouble
with Communist rebels), Australia,
New Zealand, and the Philippines.
It is difficult to see how anyone
could realize that the security of
this whole territory would be en-
dangered by Communist domina-
tion and still maintain that we
should not take the necessary
steps to prevent it.

As for the first possible argu-
ment stated above, it should be
obvious that any truce negotiated
with the Communists in Indochina
now would have to be on terms
named almost entirely by them.
The Communists know the French
are getting fed up with the end-
less fight there; they will surely
hold out for such terms as will
give them what would actually
amount to a victory. We should
realize by now that the Commu-
nists would not stop with the
domination of Indochine. Their
plan calls for world domination,
and every move they make is cal-
culated to put more and more ter-
ritory under Communist rule.

In short, any truce in Indochins
at the present would merely be

Munich appeasement of 1938, and
if we do not realize this we will
be deceiving no one but ourselves.
If the Indochinese problem can be
solved satisfactorily by mere U.S.
financial and material aid and/or
astute diplomacy, the “whole free
community” will be much better
off. But if intervention by U. S.
troops becomes necessary to save
the situation there, I do not see
how we can afford not to take
such a step. As Secretary Dulles
said, “united action” on the part
of the Allies against the Indo-
chinese Communists “might in-
volve serious risks. But these risks
are far less than those that will
face us a few years from now, if

we dare not be resolute today.”

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Artist Reuben Rubin |"

Speaks Informally

Mr. Reuben Rubin, internation-
zee famous artist, lectured in-
Wi | formally on painters and paintings
in the College Union Ballroom at
4:00 o’clock this afternoon.

Born in Galatz, Rumania, in

|) 1893; Mr. Rubin went to Jerusalem

in 1912 to study at the Bezalel Art
School. After a year there he went

~~ | to Paris, continuing his studies un-

til the First World War inter-
rupted them.

In 1918 he resumed his study of
art in Cerbauti and Bucarest, tak-
ing an active part in the Zionest
movement in those cities.

After this, "he returned to Pales-
tine and settled on the sand dunes
of Tel Aviv.

Rubin is one of the trustees of
the board of the American Fund
for Israel Institutions. When the
new State of Israel was created,

turn to other solutions of the prob-
lem found in a true amateur pro-
gram entered into with colleges,
which are genuinely homogenous.

Even the Wildest Club goal of
“batting 500” in football is entire-
ly unrealistic when seen in the
light of the overall athletic goal.
The Southern Conference has prac-
tically no school which is compara-
ble to us in size and composition
of the student body, in academic
standards, in curriculum, and final-
ly in the amount of athletic sub-
sidization.

This leads some to conclude that
we should alter some of our dif-
ferences to be more compatible
with the characteristics of the
group. It would seem to this writer
to present a far more courageous,
more prudent, and more justifiable
stand to begin honestly and much
more diligently looking for col-
leges which have the same basic
aims and programs as we.

No athletic program can suc
ceed withdut competition. It is im-
portant also to provide competition
on the same general level so as to
insure workable agreements as to
policing practices that will be fol-
lowed, eligibility requiremenis
that will be comparable from col-
lege to college, and to secure con-
tinuance of trust among member
colleges.

This move will doubtless prove
unpopular with the modern ex-
ponents of commercialized foot-
ball, but as Mr. Tom Robinson on
Tuesday put it (paraphrased),
“Speak out on a subject about
which you feel strongly when your
conscience says you should, even
though it may be an unpopular
stand.”

Mathew Brady Portraits

Now Displayed in Union

Occupying the spotlight on the
display board of the College Union
this week is a collection of por-
traits by Mathew Brady, a noted
Civil War photographer. The ex-
hibit, which comes to Davidson
from the Ansco Film Company, is
being sponsored by the Davidson
College Camera Club. Andy Simons,
president of the club, said the dis-
play will remain in the Union
through Sunday, April 3.

FEENEY IS PRESIDENT

STUDENT GROUP...

(Continued From Page Two)
they could also help to spear-
head any program for the ad-
ministration among the 800
lost souls on this campus. If
the noise for accepting @ pro-
gram comes from members of
one’s own group, It has a fot
better chance of being ac-
cepted then’ one which is
crammed et us with little or
no explenation. ..

The need for this group is ur-
gent and immediate. Rumor al-
ready has it that the administra-
tion is not going to decide whether
the freshmen will eat all year in
the Union until this summer, when
all the books have been balanced.
If such a decision is made without
consulting those who are most di-
rectly affected—the students—then
we may as well kiss good-bye to
any stadent-administration rapport
or singleness of purpose, which ex-
ists now on shaky ground.

This group should have leaders

and it should exercise the fead-

ership which has been sedly
neglected and unexploited
among the student body. These

_men would have the responsi-

bility of presenting concrete,

reasonable recommendations
te the administration, and also

“of aligning the students be-

hind the plens which are con-

sidered to be mutually accepte-
ble and helpful to both groups
of the college. With smert
leadership and the support of
us other kindred souls, it
could well be a large step in
the direction of positive stu-
dent government.
