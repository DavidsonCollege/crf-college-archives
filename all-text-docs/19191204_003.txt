sided and Oltman led the singing.
“T Love to Tell the Story,” “More
About Jesus,” the “Battle Hymn of
the Republic,” and “He Leadeth
Me” were sung heartily. Dr. Ar-
buckle offered a helpful prayer; S.

cornet duet. Mr. Miles invited the
visitors to attend the Sunday even-

BIBLE CLASSES WONDERFUL
ASSET TO CAMPUS LIFE

——

Practical Christianity, the impor-

tance of Christ’s teaching in man’s

social relations with his fellowmen,
has been the topic studied by the
Bible classes this fall. Every man
who has carefully studied this sub-
ject has strengthened his character
by learning how to adapt Christian-
ity to the problems of every-day

life.

This branch of the Y. M. C. A.
program has the special advantage
of being both systematic and per-
sonal. Each active member has had
access to a copy of “The Social
Principles of Jesus,” which has been
the basis of discussion. As a rule
every: fellow his felt free to ex-
press himself on the important is-
sucs. -

The attendance has been good, as
will be seen by the records below:

MOVIES GALORE.

Jacl: Pickford and Marguerite Clark
Furnish Spiendid Entertainment. |

The college has been unusually
fortunate this week in that two
movies have been shown instead of
one. Thursday night the Civic!
League .presented Jack Pickford
and Louise Huff in “Seventeen.”
The picture was a good one and un-
usually well acted, especially as re-
gards that jewel of a “little sister”
who always managed to be a third
party whenever anything was going’
on. As the picture principally con- |
cerned itself with the tragic love!
affairs of a 17-year-old boy, it was
peculiarly suited to a college audi-:
ence and repeatedly brought down,
the house in howling applause. The!
only regret’ is that it did not follow '
Booth Tarkington’s book a bit more
closely. .

This picture was followed on Fri-:
day night by the regular “Y” pic-;
ture with Marguerite Clark. starring |
in “The Goose Girl.” The picture:
was a baffling maze of court’ in-.
trigue and conflicting love affairs.
Perhaps the most striking feature.
was the freedom and utter impar-
tiality with which one of the minor!
characters bestowed right and -Ieft!
hand salutes. The jovial King!
Philip with his expert. swordsman- |

And then, best of all, was
not ‘Marguerite Clark there? And,
who can describe anything about’
Marguerite Clark? It was certainly, |
as all agree, a fine picture. It is rare

—| indeed that one finds two such ex-

cellent pictures coming together.
