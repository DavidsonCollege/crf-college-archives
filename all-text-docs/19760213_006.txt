Freshmen flood Patterson,
100 jam Court waiting lists

By MEG CAMPBELL
Staff Writer

Last Thursday night fresh-
men participated in self-select-
ion of eating houses; this year,
however, the results were fdr
from normal.

“Fewer people got in houses
this year than in the past,’
said Dean of Students Will
Terry. ‘“‘Even though I don’t
know the exact figure, the
waiting lists are long.”’

For the first tme since the
transition on Patterson court
from fraternities to eating
houses, approximately 100
freshmen have been placed on
waiting lists.

“A lot of this is determined
by the size of the senior class
each year,” said Terry.

Terry and the Patterson
Court Council knew before
self-selection that there would
probably be an overflow. The
results of a survey distributed
to freshmen by Terry indica-
ted full facilities--even though
not all surveys were turned in.
‘‘The lesson we can draw is
that we are developing a larger
student body without the
other resources to take care of
their social needs,”’ said Terry.

Jeff Neikirk, chairman of
Patterson Court Council, said
one problem is that the court
was designed for a school of
1000 students. Presently Dav-
idson has an enrollment. of
about 1300. Another major
factor was the strong rush put
on freshmen by _ several

houses. In anticipation of this
overflow, all eating houses
were asked to increase ceilings
to the maximum.

“T can say with some degree
of certainty that a lot of the
houses are full, even too full,’’
said Terry.

The houses are full, and as it
stands the waiting freshmen
will have to continue eating
with the Slater program.

The possibility of reopening
Rusk House has once again
been suggested. Neikirk, how-
ever, does not see this in the

- immediate future. ‘‘Presently

Rusk House is being used as a
training table for football. It’s
a good idea, although some
have complained of the waste
of facilities for six months of

the year.

‘The house is also used for
alumni receptions maybe once
every couple of weeks. There
are: ample facilities elsewhere
that could be used for recept-
ions, but the football staff
needs a place the size of Rusk
for a training table.”’

Conjecturing on ‘‘if’’ Rusk
house was opened to relieve
the overflow, Neikirk said that
with a capacity of sixty or
seventy everyone could possi-
bly fit in.

‘‘We want to in planning our
social life not to stuff people
into houses. The Student Life
Committee felt long ago that
70 was the optimum number
both socially and for economic
solvency,” said Terry.

Outside Perspectives

The editors of the Williams College Record have gone on
record opposing smoking in classrooms and other campus
facilities. They cite warnings made by the Surgeon
General of the United States aganst the use of
‘‘carcenogenic elements,’’ which destroy not only the
health of the smoker but that of othrs in the room too.

While affirming the right to smoke in private, the
editors noted that an increasing number of professors are
banning cigarette smoking during classes. Students may

‘also request that other students do not smoke in class,
thus protecting their own health, and smokers are general-
ly courteous enough not to smoke if requested.

Williams’ College Council failed to adopt a resolution
that would have prohibited all classroom smoking,
although the faculty of Williams has passed a smoking
ban for faculty meetings. Like Davidson, Williams has
designated areas for smokers in the library, and Williams
might also be able to separate smokers from non-smo-
kers in the larger dining halls as well.

Senate reforms electoral procedures

By STEPHEN BELL
Senior News Editor

At its meeting Tuesday
night, the SGA Senate passed
a resolution that, ‘“‘No review
which counts more than a
daily quiz shall be given
during the last three days
before the end of regularly
scheduled classes.”” The reso-
lution, introduced by Senator
Ed Sibley, passed by a unani-
mous vote.

The Senate’s resolution will
be sent on to the faculty more
as a recommendation than as a
demand. Said Bo Baskin,

the end of fall term classes and
the beginning of fall exams.
There was some complaint
about this in the Senate, but
the greatest complaint was
aroused by the fact that once
again there will be classes on
Good Friday.

By a vote of 10-2, with three .
abstentions, the Senate
passed a resolution that there
should be no classes on Good
Friday. Commented Baskin,
“Tt was such an overwhelming
vote, I’m sure it will have an
effect on the Executive Com-

some reforms of its elections

board was established to ad-

the strict filing deadlines

more appointments were
made; Bo Hunter was re-

The committee will aim at

just at one all the time.

“That’s the sort of thing we
