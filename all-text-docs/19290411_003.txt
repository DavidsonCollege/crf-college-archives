The Ministerial Band held a very in-

being no business of great importance the

Arbuckle, of the Davidson faculty, who
was the speaker of the afternoon. Doctor
Arbuckle took the subject for his
talk the fifteenth chapter of John, stress-
ing in particular the phrase in the eighth
verse, “Bearing much fruit.” In his own
original and interesting way, Doctor Ar-
buckle told of two apple trees that he
had, one a Northern Spire, which bore
a half dozen good apples and the other
a splendid King David, which bore a
great number of fine apples.

Conquering the Cascades

NOW falls every month in the
year where the Great Northern
crosses the Cascades. Steep, tortuous
gtades increase the difficulty of the
railroading problem. Nature has stub-
bornly resisted man’s effort to conquer

the range.
In January, 1929, the

tunnel was opened. Man, with elec-

tricity as an ally, had
quered the Cascades.

The eight-mile bore was
driven in three years—a

record impossible without electric
power. And electrification has been
extended to the entire 75-mile route
through the mountains.

The conquests of electricity on the
land and on the sea, in the air, and

underground, are making practicable

con-

the impossibilities of yesterday. As
our vision encompasses wider hori-
zons, electricity appears as

a vital contribution to future

industrial progress and human
welfare.
