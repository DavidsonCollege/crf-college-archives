Making The Grade,

With ‘Honors’ —

Before the Honors College was put into opera-
tion in the fall of this year, many students were prone
to joke “Is there an Honors College?” and if the
answer was affirmative, thé question came back,
“then where is it?”

Unfortunately, the question ‘Is there an Honors
College?” continues to haunt many students both in-
side and outside that mystical institution.

The point was brought home to many students
by the recent letter to members of the Honors Col-
lege stating that they would be expected to do
“honors” work in at least one of their courses or
honofs projects.

For those not familiar with the lingo of that
select group, the letter means that at least one ‘‘A”
is expected out of members of the Honors College
per term if they are-to continue in the programs.

The penalty for not making this “A” is a bit
vague though members of the group would probably
use the term “unstructured.”

This new requirement is a disappointment for
several reasons. For one thing it implies a rigidity
not indicated in the outline of the Honors College
distributed to students last spring. Making certain
grades are not a prerequisite for membership in the
college we had been told.

But even worse, the new requirement reexposes
the Honors College student to.the rather capricious
academic evaluation system existing at Davidson. The
guise of a hia ere structure only thinly veils the
system in effect for the student body at large, and
in light of the “honors” requirement the veil appears
“more diaphanous than ever. ;

We readily admit that in theory the admissions
process for the Honors College should find students
motivated to the point that little evaluation need be
made of their work as long as it is properly guided.

We also admit that any selection process may
make mistakes and that some method needs to exist
for recognizing these mistakes and correcting them.

Yet in the eyes of many students the present
method does not-seem to be the one they expected
to find in the Honors College.

We hope that while the Honors College is still
developing as a relatively young campus institution,
it will remain flexible enough to avoid the rigidity
students want to escape by entering it.

If such will be the case, porneps student alarm
at the ‘present requirement will prove unjustified.

Pricing Competition

It. is now official, applications to Davidson this
year are dramatically below their levels of previous
years. Either high school senjers are finally beginning
to wise up or Davidson needs to examine itself for
some real problems.

H. Edmunds White has noted one factor. which
may be major and that is of increasing college costs.

While Davidson is priced below several other
institutions in the state, costs are still high.and seem
to get higher every year. There could be a real
danger that Davidson might price itself right) out of
the student diversity it hopes to attract. . ..

We would like to urge our new Vice President
in charge of finances to Seriously consider this pro-
blem because more than anything, Davidson is its
students. *

- New and imaginative solutions to the financial
problems. of higher education need to be found be-

fore Davidson loses the quality of that most’ valuable’

of its resources.

I'm courious. As an alum-

1) What are the three most

3) What is my role, if any,

I’m convinced there is a

Lach Student Decides
Mis Own Dorm Policy

Intercollegiate Press

Early this year there was
a great deal of speculation

about the University of Min-

nesota’s thennew policy
which allows. students _to
have guests of either sex
visit them in their dorms at
any hour.

The 24-hour policy is in ef-

fect for the majority of the ..

Twin Cities campus dorm
residents this year. Studies
made available this fall in-
dicated that few parents op-
pose the policy — which is
neither as wide-open ° as
Many assume, nor is it put

to maximym use by  stu-.

dents.

4,038

Nearly two-thirds of the
students living in
dorms live under the 24-hour
option; about 80 per cent of
these students are under 21
years old and have parental
permission. Almost  one-*
third have chosen _limited
visitation and some two per
cent opted for no. visitation.
None. of the University’s

eight dorms operates en-
tirely under one option. In-
stead, units within each
dorm operate separately un-
der the policy chosen by its
students. For example,
Frontier Hall, with 10 units,.
has seven with 24-hour visit-
ation, two- with limited vi-
Sitation, some none at all,

it, which was unique in its
total involvement with my
life and the life of my Ameri-
can society, :

I have ¢o tell you about
it because it fs one of the
few real educational pro-
grams around. It carries in
its design more than what
is considered classroom, edu-
cation, something more than
words,

The education I want to
share with you comes under
the .title ‘“‘Urban-Black Se-
mester Programs.”

The usual classroom rap
of power, violence, sex, civil
rights? Yes, I received lec:
tures on thesé topies and
more, but my invoivemient
was not limited to leétures
and book lists.

Each student worked from
four to six hours a day un-
der black léadership as a
volunteer in’ a community
organization. This phase of
the program brought into
reality what I had read and
intellectualized.

I gained new perspectives
for my own understanding
of’ the white-black polariza-
tion, by experiencing the
black community as teach-
er. The. program _ provided
the setting for an atmo-
sphere of reciprocal hearing
as the struggle continued
for understanding and mean-
ing between people.

The combination of the
three phases — intensive
lectures and reading con-
cerning the black. experi-
ence, community invalve-
ment, and reflection semi-
nars — made this a time of
cohesive learning. School
that made sense. Life.

But still, ‘‘What did it all
mean?" People ask me that
all the time and I think the
question is valid, and yet, “it
is not one TI choose to answ-
er to you. I choose rather
to answer myself.

My own accountability to
the blatant racism that is
being perpetuated in our
country is my responsibility,
and only I- know what pow-
er I have to affect change
within my own community.

It matters not so much for
you to know what part I am
taking in the struggle, as it
matters. for you to. know
what part you are taking.

So I hear you saying —
“Why does she ever bother
to write this article, # she
chooses not to tell’ about her
personal involvement of the
present?”’ I bother Hecause
the Urban-Black Semester
Programs helped me get my
head together, arid begin to
see the power that I could

_ use to stimulate change.

I write because I believe
in this type of educational
experience for those people
who are seriously motivated
to *‘do something.”

It’ provides the sensitivity
necessary for understanding
the complexity of racial pol-
arization and the self-prepa-
ration. n&cessary for a new
racial reality in America.
