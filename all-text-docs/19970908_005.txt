THE DAVIDSONIAN.

By ANDREW PRESTON
Staff Writer

Andrew Preston of the Davidsonian recently
: spoke with Patterson Court Council (PCC) presi-
dent Hallie Pitkin. She described her plans and
hopes for the upcoming school year.

The Davidsonian: What goals does the
PCC have for the upcoming year?

Pitkin: The PCC hopes to create a safer
environment on the Court this year. Since the
houses on the court serve alcohol, we must
follow the regulations or constraints that a bar
would follow. If we act like a bar by providing
alcohol to students outside of our eating house or
fraternity, we need to perform like a bar in the
enforcement of our policies.

D: Are there any major changes in the alcohol
policy this year?

P: One major change is that all students who
purchase PCC stickers will have to sign a waiver
stating that they accept all liability or risk while
on the Court. The other change is that the
policies we already have will be adhered to much
more strictly. If we enforce these policies effec-
tively, we can retain the freedom and responsi-
bility we are allowed by the College, rather than
forcing the College to create further regulations.

D: How are the houses on the Court reacting to
this stricter environment?

P: Most of the fraternities and eating houses
really support the policies, whereas in the past
many of them simply followed the policies be-
cause they had to. There is a much greater
understanding of why we need to enforce the
policies than in the past.

D: Have there been any newdevelopments with
the possi-
bility of
bringing

t °
Davidson?

P: Actu-
ally, we
have re-
cently re-
ceived
confir-
mation
that 19 of the 26 national sororities from the NPC
[National Pan-Hellenic Council] are interested
in starting a colony in Davidson. Of those we
will select five or six to visit the campus. Then,
depending on student interest, we will invite one
or two of those to begin a colony at Davidson.

with Hallie Pitkin

D: Are there any expected changes for specific
eating houses or fraternities this year?

P: There will be quite a few changes in the self-
selection process for the eating houses this year.
Freshwomen will be allowed to cluster up to four
people, so that they will be ensured that some of

sororities

their friends will be in their eating house. Also,
the whole self-selection process will be much
more fotmalized. In the past the process has
been based on a gentleman’s agreement.

D: Are these chariges due to problems in the
past with the self-selection process?

P: Yes. These changes are a response to the fact
that many freshwomen in the past have been
upset when they don’t get into the eating house
of their choice or the eating house that their
friends get. Many freshwomen don’t understand
the selection process, and feel that they will be
automatically accepted into their first choice.
There will also be a meeting on September 24 to
inform all freshwomen about the self-selection
process.

D: Are there any other changes within the PCC
this year?

P: Weare hoping to coordinate more interfra-

ternity events. The executives from each frater-
nity are expected to meet in October to discuss
ways to promote interaction between fraterni-
ties. And, of course, we rave anew PCC advisor,
Jim Barber.

D: What is your general attitude toward the
PCC as you begin the new year?

P: Iam very optimistic. Our Council seems
supportive and enthusiastic, and Jim Barber is
energetic and holds a positive outlook. It should
be a very productive year. ;
