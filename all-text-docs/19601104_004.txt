“It's an appointive job which

the trips. You're intended to
break about even after the year
is up.”

About half of his work
took place in New York City
where he carried on corres-
pondence, planned meetings,
attended conferences, and pre-
pared literature. At one point
Cooley worked with a North-
ern group supporting Negro
sit-ins in the South and with

, committees concerned with
mnon-siolence Negro organiza-
tion groves in schools,

“One interesting thing about
my capacity as Youth Associate
‘was. that I was ‘a non-govern-"
gaental organization observer
at the U.N. and. was able to
sit in on their sessions,” Cooley
said.

Cooley also visited local and
state U. C. Y. M. councils and
training conferences in Arkan-
sas. Tennessee. Massachusetts.
Virginia. Texas, and Minnesota.

A highlight of the year’s work ,
was attending the European’
Ecumenical Youth Assembly in
Lausanne, Switerland in July.
This was actually a European
assembly of about 1200 young
European church workers, but!
over 150 Americans from the
United States and Canada. along
with a number of delegates from
Asia and Africa, attended the
Assembly as a means of making’
the Assembly truly ecumenical
and to help the Europeans see
themselves as others see them.

The European churches in

the world situation today, the
task of the churches in a
changing Europe, and the re-
newal, mission, and unity of
the focal church were the
three themes pursued at the
assembly.

Priest Expounds
Catholic Doctrine

Father Cuthbert Allen, Vice-
chancellor and professor of his-
tory at Belmont Abbey. spoke
to the Westminster Fellowship
last Friday night on “The Im-
plications of a Catholic Presi-
dent.”

A question-answer period was |
preceded by a few remarks by!
Father Allen on ‘current mis-
‘conceptions about the Roman
Catholic Church and its doc--
triné. He pointed out that the:
never been established in any
country, stating that the Church
is ‘supranational.’

Although he admitted that
there was close cooperation ,
between the Church and state
in Spain and Latin America, he
claimed. that the only establish-
ed churches have ‘been in such
countries as England and Scot-
land.

Father Allen was asked about
the alleged entry of the Catho-
lic Church into Puerto Rican
polities in the last few weeks,
and replied that the reports
have undoubtedly been distort-
ed and that the religious and
political situation in Puerto
Rico is such that it justifies ac-.
tion of this kind.

Concerning the ‘American.
heirarchy,” Father Allen stated’
that none of the American bish-
ops or other church officials
were interested or concerned
enough with politics to try to
interfere, if Senator Kennedy is
elected.

POETRY’S ESSENTIAL

He thinks poetry is essential
in this age of technology and
juke boxes — as essential as
science for everybody.

“The scientific revolution

changed everything. our rela

tion to the world. the way we
see the world. One of the re-
{sults is that now the knowledge
of a fact and the feel of the
fact have become disassociated.

“Now, for the first time in
history, it’s possible for a man
to know something with the
mind and yet not understand
it as a man.

“As a result, for instance, we
;get a serious discussion of us-
jing the atomic bomb. The Chi-
(nese say atomic warfare is in-
‘evitable. and our two political
jcandidates say it’s at least pos-

tration camps — but it didn't

when it. played in Germany, the
people were affected for the
first time. They left the thea-
ters stunned.

“The inevitable conclusion is
this: poetry, the kind of
.knowledge which poetry con-
veys, makes it possible to
know the emotional reality of
an experience.

TRUTH WITH PASSION

“It’s just as Wordsworth de-
scribed it: Poetry is ‘truth car-
ried alive into, the heart with
passion.’"

He repeated the phrase for
emphasis, leaning forward in
his chair.

“I not only think poetry has
a place today; it has a place
equally important with the sci-
ences. The absence of poetic
sensibility is one of the reasons
for this disssociation of know-

“Frost is a great poet. too:
on a level with Emily Dickin-
son. And if Eliot‘isn’t great,
I don't know what greatness
is.

AMERICA’S INFLUENTIAL

“This is a time in which the
work of American poets has be-
come the most influential poe-
try in the world. Pound and
Eliot have had a tremendous
influence.”

The questioning turned ab-
ruptly to national politics, and
MacLeish, a ‘Jeffersonian lib-
eral” and former speech-writer
for Adlai Stevenson, declared
himself for Kennedy.

“There's no question about
his intelligence, his force. I feel
he knows his own mind. He
won't farm out his problems as
Efsenhower has done, nr ‘will
he ask advice as much as Ad-
lai Stevenson would have.”

NIXON’S LICKED

A reporter asked if he
thought Kennedy would win.
MacLeigh laughed.

“If I ever saw a man who
knows he's going to be licked,
it's Nixon.”

He likened Kennedy to
Franklin Roosevelt, whom Mac-
Leish knew during the last
years of his administration.

“Kennedy has charm, though
not more than Roosevelt, who
was the most charming creature
I’ve ever known. He has vital-
ity and leadership — whatever
that is — as Roosevelt had.”

“SUPINE COWARDICE”

The poet compared Roosévelt
and Kennedy as both having ‘a
primary interest in means” ra-
ther than a more philosophic
bent such as Stevenson’s.

“When Roosevelt came to of-
fice, this country was sodden
with fear, terror and the most;
supine cowardice. Roosevelt got !
it moving again; Kennedy may
have that power.”

Asked if the country was now
in the same condition of “su-
pine cowardice” as when Roose-
velt came into office, he re-
plied, “No, but we're pretty

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1960

To have the Sun, symbol of
kingship, on the Midheaven is
precisely a configuration that
portends elevation to high rank.
Despite the fact that the Re-
gressed Ascendant appears in
opposition to regressed Saturn
in the 7th house, this merely
denotes minor obstacles before
reaching a desired goal.

If we chart Nixon’s purely
sidereal solar return (P.S.S.R.)
and attempt an interpretation,
we find Uranus in the Midhea-
veh. This portends the uhex-
pected and the unpredictable.
Solar and transiting Neptune is
on the Ascendant, implying
disillusionment .and disenchant-
ment for Nixon.

SLIGHT HOPE

From the point of view of do-
mestic life, Nixon’s solar return
quotidian (S.R.Q.) is excellent,
but. this hardly indicates elec-
tion to high rank. Here again
we observe the grave aspects

IFC Proposals

who rate two colleges virtually

Sun Says Jack Will Win

connected with the transit of
the malefics in mutual opposi-
tion, close to the solar and natal
Sun.

On Kennedy's PSSR chart we
note the solar Venus and Sun
straddling the Ascendant. This
configuration, involving’ the
Sun, is precisely what we should
expect to find in the charts of
those chosen for high positions.

JUPITER REIGNS

Finally, Kennedy's SQ horo-
scope reveals that if he were
living some place east of Wash-
ington, D. C., Jupiter would be
precisely in the Midheaven,
which would indicate success
and achievement.

Also in Kennedy’s SQ _ horo-
scope, the solar Mars on the
Ascendent is at its maximum
strength, which is a token of.
victory against immeasurable
odds.

Kennedy's lunar and anlunar
{returns before clection show
'Kennedy’s demilunar return oc-
;eurring with the Sun (Kingship)
precisely on the Ascendant, al-

equal, would not come to Dav-)beit in conjunction with Nép-

idson unless they are willing
to saerifice social life
pletely.

Finally, the IFC believes that
the freshmen's grades would
actually suffer because there
would be no incentive to make
the C or C-plus average needed
for initiation. Also, almost
every fraternity has incentives
to scholastic achievement and
improvement as well as requir-
ed study and individual atten-
tion for pledges. ,

The faculty considered the
proposals for some time on
Tuesday but came to no con-
clusions because they ran out
of time and some of the new
faculty members as well as
some of the others wanted time
to consider the problem before
making any decision.

A number of motions con-
cerning various aspects of the
situation were considered but
none passed. The motion to re-
turn the proposals to the IFC
was not even seconded. The
problem will be considered at
the next faculty meeting, which
will either be a called meeting
later this month or the regular
December faculty meeting.

Cole said, “The best way to
maintain Freshman Rush is to
do two things, (1) for upper-
classmen to take less of the

com-

{ tune.

Careful study of these paired -
charts will reveal that the
weight of evidence is in favor
of Kennedy, for his are the
only charts in which the regal
Sun plays a dominant part.

Therefore, John Fitzgerald
Kennedy will be elected to the
presidency on November 8,
1960, unless the universe is in-
volved in a shocking and vio-
lent upheaval some time prior
to this date.
