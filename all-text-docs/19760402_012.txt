Chorus presents climactic program

By JAYNE REICH
Staff Writer

The BrankoKrsmanovich Chorus
of Belgrade gave an exhilarating
performance in Love Auditorium on
Monday night that I wished more
people in the college and community
had had the good fortune to attend.

Their music ranged chronologically
from the 14th century to the present
and included a variety of styles and
nationalities, notably an ‘Alleluia’
by Tchaikovsky, ‘‘Salangadou’’--a
Creole lament, a Negro spiritual,
some Russian folk songs, ‘‘Missa
Criola’’--a modern Spanish piece, and
two Renaissance compositions sure in
French and Italian.

The first two parts of the program
in fact included only two Yugoslav
arrangements. I particularly liked
“Stycheron to Stefan Dechansky,’’
written in unmetered live in the 14th
century, and sung in Old Servian by a
male soloist with the chorus presiding
the background.

For the ‘‘Missa Criolla’’ sung in
Spanish, a variety of instruments

were used including guitars, accor-
dion, bass, clarinet, and several *
percussion instruments. The compo-
sition, performed in numberous parts |

all intermingling, provided a climactic +

ending before the intermission.

For the third part of the program
all 52 singers returned to the stage in
intensely colorful beautiful national
costumes. The costumes represented
all of the states within Yugoslavia,
and the colors and textures set the
mood for the lightheartedness of the
rest of the performance.

The audience seemed to respond
more excitedly to this second nation-
alistic segment. Though afterwards,
Bogdan Churchin--a member of the
chorus--told me he thought the ap-
plause had been quite steady
throughout. He himself preferred the
classical part of the program and said
that they rarely performed the
national songs at home in Yugoslavia.

Nevertheless the Kolo music , (for
the traditional Kolo folk dance--very
lively), the folk tunes, and finally a
suite of choral and instrumental
selections roused the audience into

Bandwagon

warm applause and finally a standing
ovation.

The Chorus, named after a Yugos-
lav hero, has toured throughout
Europe and is currently at the end of
its sixth American tour which began
in January-consisting of 80 perfor-
mances in 95 days. Before the gray
returns home they will sing at the
United Nations headquarters and in
Carnegie Hall.

The members of the Chorus re-
presented a wide variety of profes-
sions and fields of study. Some had
sung in the first American tour in

1961 and for other younger members
this was the first. They seemed quite
relaxed during the reception following
the perfomance and there seemed to
be a sincere exchange of mutual
appreciation with those in the audi-
ence who were able to go to the
Morrison Room afterwards.

Apparently the Chorus has had a
successful tour as they have been
asked to return to the United States
next year. If all their performances
have been as fine as the one on
Monday night then I can see why.
