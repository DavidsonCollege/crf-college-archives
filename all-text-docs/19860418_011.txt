Take your pick: Yankees or Mets in Series

By EDWIN PAGE

Well, baseball season has finally
come, and, undetered by my less than
sterling prognostication in the NCAA’s,
Tm ready to try again. Don't bet your
money though, because last. year I
thought that the Braves would contend.

In the National League East, every-
one is picking the Mets and I have to
agree. Gary Carter and Darry! Straw-
berry were the number five and six home-
run hitters in the league with 32 and 29 re-
spectively and George Foster added 21.
In addition, Keith Hernandez hit .309,
sixth in the league. The offense alone is
enough to make them contenders, but
they also have Dwight Gooden who is al-
most a guarantee of 25 wins alone.
Gooden allowed only two runs on open-
ing night, but the scary part is that two
earned runs is a below average game for
him. Last year, he posted an amazing
1.53 ERA, best in the majors.

The Cardinals won the pennant, but
nearly everyone on the team had the best
year of their life. They will win again if
Willie McGee hits .353, Tom Herr drives
in 97 cuns, John Tudor has ten shutouts,
and someone on their pitching staff can
win 21 games in place of Joaquin An-
dujar, but ['m not counting on it. The
Cubs’ pitching staff fell apart like a cheap
suit last year, and it’s hard to win with
minor leaguers on the mound. They will
be better, but old age is catching up on
them and will keep them from the pen-
nant. The rest of the division, Montreal,

Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia will be
finish out of the picture.

In the West, I was prepared to pick
the hated Dodgers until Pedro Guerrero
went down with a knee injury and took
the Dodger offense with him. They still
have the best pitching in the league, but
you can’t win if you can’t score. Unless
Guerrero heals quickly, the Dodgers will
be playing golf in October. The team that
will profit from the Dodger misfortune is
the rejuvenated Cincinnati Reds. Pete
Rose has had them playing good baseball
ever since he became manager late in ‘84,
and this should be his year. Dave Parker
returned to his late 70’s form last year
when he hit .312 with 34 homers and 125
RBI's. The Reds shored up their pitching
over the off season with some shrewd
trading, and they look to be the favorite.

The Braves should be improved over
last year’s excuse for a team. They ac-
quired a good catcher in Ozzie Virgil and
a proven manager in Chuck Tanner,
which were two glaring weaknesses last
year. Their young pitching is the big
question mark, but its hard to be worse
than last in team ERA as they were last
year. They should break .500, but not by
much.

The Padres lost their manager, Dick
Williams, right before spring training,
and their two main power hitters, Steve
Garvey and Graig Nettles, are getting
old. They will fade early, and the Giants
will be the Giants as usual. Houston

won't win because God hates indoor
baseball.

In the American League West, the
Royals are the best bet in baseball. Al-
though they had the second worst team
batting average in the league last year.
their pitching staff is clearly superior to
any in their division. They also have
George Brett, whose .335 average. 30
homeruns and 12 RBI's would have
won the MVP in any year but °85. If Brett
stays healthy and the young pitching
staff, especially Cy Young Award win-
ner and World Series MVP _ Brett
Saberhagen, can avoid a letdown, the
Royals should cruise.

The Angels were the Royals’ chief
competition despite the worst team bat-
ting average in the league. Manager Gene
Mauch simply found a way to win
whenever his team stayed close. The
Angels were an amazing 30-13 in one-
run games last year, but I can’t see them
having that kind of record again. Chicago
may be the only team with a real chance
to chase the Royals. If Ron Kittle remem-
bers that he can really hit and Floyd Ban-
nister can regain the form that once made
him the most feared left-hander in the
league, the White Sox could be in it come
September. Oakland could surprise with
young slugger Jose Canesco, Dave “King
Kong” Kingman and Andujar. The
Twins and Mariners fall under the same
wrathful eye as the Astros.

The AL East is still the best division
in baseball, although its dominance may

Cats squeak by N.C.State University

be on the wane. The Yankees, Blue Jays,
and Tigers all have very good chances to
make it to post-season play. Boston and
Baltimore might have a chance else-
where, but the competition is too strong.

The Jays have everything you could
want in a team except a proven manager.
On pure talent, they are probably still the
best team in baseball, but Bobby Cox's
departure and the fact that they won last
year will conspire them and keep them in
second. The Tigers are a team to watch
now that they have shed the defending
champion monkey from their backs.
They, like the Jays, have pitching, speed
and power, and they will be hungry after
last year’s embarrasing third place finish.

However, as much as I hate to say it, I
think this is the Yankees’ year. Don Mat-
tingly played like a Hall of Famer last
year with a .324 average, 35 home mins
and an astounding 145 RBI's while play-
ing excellent first base. In addition the
Yanks have Ricky Henderson, who is far
and away the best leadoff hitter in the
game today, and another fair player
named Dave Winfield. If the New York
pitchers show up for the season, the
Yanks should be there at the end.

In October, you'll be hearing “New
York, New York” a lot because it looks
like another subway series is on the way.
It will be close, but even the Yankees
won't hit Gooden and the Mets will walk
away winners.

Last week, Davidson was
knocked out of first place in the
southern division of the Southern
Conference when they were
beaten in two out of three games
by Furman. Meanwhile, Western
Carolina won three straight games
over The Citadel to bolt into a one
and a half lead over Davidson.

The Cats still finished the
week with a 3-2 record by picking
up non-conference victories over
Catawba and North Carolina
State. The win over State allowed
the Cats to notch their second
Straight 20 win season. David-
son's record now stands at 9-6 in
the conference and 20-9- 1 overall.

In the victory over Catawba,
the Cats used a seven run sixth in-
ning to destroy the Indians 11-3.
Senior Scott Weaver got the win
as he pitched five strong innings to
run his record to 3-0 on the year.
Senior Chip Knox picked up the
save by allowing only one run
over the final three innings.

The Cats started their scoring
in the first inning when sopho-
more Bill Masse scored on a sac-
rifice fly by sophomore Alan
Lewis.

Davidson scored three more
Tuns in the fifth inning. Junior
David Turgeon’s double scored
Masse and senior Keith Helfant
who had both walked. Weaver
then smacked a RBI single to cen-
terfield to score Turgeon giving
the Cats a 4-1 lead.

In the sixth’ inning the Cats
broke the game open. With one
out both sophomore Chris Stuart

and Masse walked. Helfant then
brought both of them home when
he doubled down the leftfield line.
Lewis followed Helfant with a
single which put runners on first
and third base. Turgeon then
smashed a three-run home run
over the leftfield fence giving
Davidson a 9-2 lead.

Weaver continued the hitting
barrage as he doubled to right-
field. He moved to third on a wild
pitch and scored on an RBI fiel-
der’s choice by sophomore Rob
Zimmerman. The Cats scored
their seventh run of the inning
when sophomore Roy Vilardi,
who had singled, was brought
home on a double by junior Dave
Depaul.

For the game the Cats had 15
hits and were led in hitting by
Weaver, who was a perfect four

for four, and Turgeon, who had a
double, a home run and five RBIs.
On Friday, the Cats opened up
the series against Furman with a
thrilling come-from-behind 10-7
victory over the Paladins. David-
son used a seven run seventh in-
ning to pull out the victory.
Trailing 7-3 going to the top of

the seventh inning, the Cats rally
was started by Stuart when he
singled. Masse followed with
another single and Helfant walked
to load the bases with no one out.
Stuart scored the first run when
Turgeon ripped a single to
leftfield. Lewis followed Turgeon
with another single which scored
Masse. Helfant scored the next
run when junior Dan Simonds
walked on a 3-2 pitch with the
bases loaded. Weaver then tied
the game at 7-7 when he hit into a
fielder’s choice which scored Tur-
geon. With one out, Waters put
the Cats ahead when his single
scored both Lewis and Simonds.
Waters scored the final run of the
inning when Vilardi hit an RBI
single to the outfield.

Junior pitcher Steven Condon
picked up the complete game vic-
tory to run his record to 8-0 on the
season. He got off to a rough start
when Furman scored five runs in
the first three innings. He settled
down and allowed only two hits
over the final four innings. He
finished the game with seven
strikeouts to run his season total to
a team leading 49, second in the
Southern Conference.

In the second game on Friday
the Cats pitching fell apart as Fur-
man used six home muns and five
doubles to take a 17-7 victory.
The Paladins had 18 hits for the
game as they pounded three
Davidson pitchers to score at least
one mun in every inning. Their
biggest inning was the fourth
when they scored seven runs on a
pair of doubles and two home

runs.

Davidson's biggest inning
was the sixth when they scored
seven runs on five hits. The key
hits in that inning were a three-run
home run by junior Mark
Thompson and a three run double
by Turgeon. Davidson managed
only six hits for the game as Fur-
man’s pitcher Mark Burdin

The Cats face their
toughest challenge of
the season this
weekend

pitched a complete game.

On Saturday, the Cats’ pitch-
ing woes continued as they lost by
the score of 10-3. Furman used 14
hits and 10 base-on-balls to their
advantage as they scored three
runs apiece in both the second and
fourth innings.

Davidson's bats also went
cold as they could manage only
single runs in the second, fourth,
and eighth innings off of five hits.
The biggest hit for the Cats was a
solo home run by Masse in the
eighth inning. No one for the Cats
had more than one hit.

* However, Davidson came
back strong against N.C. State on
Monday afternoon as they beat the
Wolfpack 12-11. The Cats
pounded out 15 hits off five State
pitchers. The Cats’ big inning was

the third when they scored six runs
on four hits to erase a 6-3 deficit
and take a 9-6 lead. The big hits in
the inning were back-to-back
home runs by Masse and Helfant.

Masse's home run was a three-run

blast which cleared the fence in

leftfield. Helfant followed Masse

with his shot to right.

The Cats connected on four
home runs for the game. Weaver
hit a three-run home run in the first
inning to give the Cats an early 3-1
lead. Thompson accounted for the
last three Wildcat runs when he
brought home Lewis and Weaver
with a homer of his own. Leading
hitters for the Cats were Weaver
and Masse with three hits and
three RBIs apiece and Thompson
who had two hits and four RBIs.

The Cats face their toughest
challenge of the season this
weekend. First they travel to
Clemson, S.C., on Friday to take
on the Clemson Tigers. Next they
go to Cullowhee, N.C. to face
Western Carolina in two games on
Saturday and a single game on
Sunday. In order to win the divi-
sion and be host for the Southern
Conference tournament, the Cats
must win all three games. This is a
very tall order because Western
has won six straight conference
games. However, earlier this sea-
son Davidson swept three straight
games from the Catamounts when
they played at Davidson. If the
Cats can win only one game they
will still make the playoffs for the
second year in a row.
