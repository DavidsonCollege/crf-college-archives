Signing Their Own Warrant

In one swift, unexpected
move, the Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity destroyed the con-
ciliatory relationship that
existed, however tenuously,
between itself and the college
administration by voting to
conduct an early rush.

The repercussions of this
have been immediate and
severe in the judgement of
the Sig Eps; many people
regard it as just another
example of the Sig Ep men-
tality, which dictates fighting
the college plan at every
possible turn.

This is unfortunate because
it seemed to us that the college
was finally willing to quit per-
secuting the Sig Eps, if they
would only operate within cer-

tain guidelines, which
previous to October 31 they
agreed to in principle.

However, by a vote of 28-14
they shredded any faith the
college had in them by
backing out of _ their
agreement to conduct rush ac-
cording to the college plan.

They have decided to run
their own rush. What the
college will do in response to
this is uncertain at thi: point.

What can we say; only that
the Sig Eps bring it all on
themselves.

We Have All Been Here Before

Despite the advance

publicity and the importance
of the issue itself, less than 25
students bothered to attend
Monday night’s Open End on
football.

The Open End was designed

as an opportunity for students

Students Have The Right

We would like to see several
students, more than the
student body president only,
be allowed to attend and par-
ticipate in meetings of the
Faculty, but not have voting
rights. Such attendance
would not extend to
executive session, but we
would hope this would not be
abused and become a mecha-
nism to exclude students.

Student fear of the potential
of executive session may at
first appear unfounded, but in
relation to the adamant
faculty opposition to student
attendance it becomes a
measure of the distrust and
lack of communication
permeating the governance
situation.

Faculty opposition seems to
be premised upon the belief
that students lack the ex-
pertise to decide questions
such as educational policy;
yet students do not wish
decision-making capacity in
faculty meetings, but the right
to speak only.

Without direct student input
into faculty discussions there
is no assurance that student
viewpoints will be considered.

As to the importance of
student input and student
ability to provide it, both
points are the foundation for
student representatives to
faculty committees.
Realistically, it is within these
committees that basic
decisions are ,made, and

students; ; 90, thesgbodies are

now able to vote.

The Governance committee
has agreed that student in-
volvement in the Educational
Policy Committee has been
advantageous and ought to
be continued. Still, students
may not attend faculty
meetings.

Another faculty contention
in opposition to student at-
tendance is that the faculty is
an integral body and should
not include non-faculty in its
deliberations. Yet the faculty
makes decisions which affect
the entire community, and
there are allegations that
these ‘‘deliberations’”’ do in-
justice to the concept.

We cannot see why a
professor would be hesitant to
voice his views before stu-
dents. We believe that student
presence would enhance the
quality and responsibility of
remarks and contribute to a
more rational, efficient
meeting.

We also would like to see a
decision reached in gover-
nance forthwith. Two years is
long enough to master the in-
tricacies of the problem, to
reach a position, and to un-
derstand opposing positions.

It is past time to settle our
differences and leave them
behind, to be less dependent
upon structural mechanism to
resolve differences, to move

‘to those problems affecting

the entire community. It is
simply a .matter..of going
there. ry . wore

ge

we henaty

to contribute significant input
as to the direction in which the
athletic program progresses.
Not only were President Spen-
cer and Vice-President Bevan
present, but the new athletic
director Thomas Cartmill flew
down from New York to par-
ticipate in the Open End as
part of a three day visit. Yet,
few students bothered to at-
tend.

We were especially disap-
pointed by the extremely poor
representation from two
specific groups: the Senate
and the football team.

Over the past several years,
the Senate has been in the
vanguard of the movement to
change the emphasis in
athletics (especially football).

Yet once the basic decisign
has been made and
presumably all the glory of
fighting for the just cause
over, their interest disin-
tegrates.

This is a sad commentary in
two respects: 1) that the
Senators abandoned their role
when many more decisions
need to be made; and 2) that
they made no effort to be
present to hear the opinions of
their constituency, the other
students.

With regard to future
decisions, Spencer, Bevan,
and Cartmill were present as
much to hear student opinion
on several key unresolved
points as to present and ex-
plain the revamped system.
For example, no definite
decisions have been made on
all the schools to be scheduled
over the next three years.

College officials were in-
terested in getting student
opinion in order to schedule in
line with the wishes of the

. Whole , community. --¥et--no.

Senate members (except But-

ner, Rabil, and Phillips) were
even present to represent
their constituencies and voice
an opinion in such matters.

As for even knowing student
opinion we doubt if that is the
case, for here was a chance
to hear what others were
thinking in an open forum,
and the Senators ignored the
opportunity.

Where exactly this leaves
the Senate as a body we do not
know. It is probably just
another reminder of how
inadequate it really is.

_ We were also disappointed
in the lack of interest shown
by the football team. As we in-
dicated before, there are
scheduling decisions yet to be
made where the opinions of
the players themselves are
important. The ad-
ministration was making a
genuine effort to get a
schedule suitable to the
players, and they didn’t even

show up to express their
viewpoints.

Here also was an excellent
opportunity to have all their
questions answered and the

decisions explained, but they
ignored it.

It is unfortunate that more
publicity could not have been
given to the presence of Cart-
mill, (Incidentally, Cartmil]
appeared very impressive to
us. He seems genuinely in-
terested in building a first-
rate athletic program on all
levels.) but this does not ex-
cuse the poor attendance.

If the attendance is a
n
bellweather of student son,
timent, then it looks like we
are in for a return of more of

that .“‘I don't give a, damn”
