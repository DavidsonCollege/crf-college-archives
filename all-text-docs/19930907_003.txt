Davidson hires
twenty-four

new professors

By Sally Stone

Davidson’s enormous fresh-
men class do not repesent the only
new faces to be seen on campus.
Twenty-four new professors have
joined Davidson’s faculty, filling
posts in nearly every department.

Hailing from various corners
of the United States and beyond,
eleven professors have accepted
full-time positions, while the other
thirteen are considered “visiting”
professors for ¢ither a semester or
for one year.

~ Some ofthese faces are newer
than others. For example, Sylvia
Newman, this semester’s Visiting
Professor of French was hired just
last. Monday; but. many students
may recognize Jonathon Berkey,
Assistant Professor of History and
Humanities, from his appearance
on campus last semester and as the
spouse of history professor Vivian
Dietz.

The English department added
the largest number of professors.
They are: Sara Beasley, Shireen
Carroll, Rosalyn Jones, Anne
McClintok, Amy Pawl, and
Stephen Sandy, as the McGee Pro-
fessor of Writing.

Joining the history faculty are
Berkey, Garrett Fagan, and Jon
Wertheimer. Murray Simpson
joins the economics department;
and Shelley Rigger became part of
the political science department
and Susan Roberts will join her in
the spring. Daniel Cerutti and
Stephen Williams are the two new
psychology professors; and Nancy
Fairley isthe lone newcomer in the

’ anthropology department.

Inthe foreign languages, Kaori
Hatayama became Davidson’s
Japanese instructor; Burkhard
Henke joins the German depart-
ment; and Sylvia Newman recently
became a French professor.

Two new professors were
added to the music faculty. They
are Hugh Floyd and Richard Prior.
The biology department also
gained two members with the ad-
dition of John Schmidt and Ronald
Ostrowski. Lastly, Todd Will be-
came the latest member of the
mathematics faculty.

Limited housing
frustrates upperclassmen

By Court McBryde

Ever since last year’s lottery
there has been much controversy
among students concerning the
present housing situation of the
1993-94 school year.

This year there are sopho-
mores, juniors, and seniors living
inthe Duke dorm. However, there
were twenty senior women who
were unable to receive housing in
either the senior apartments or
Duke. As for men, there are many
juniors who remain in Belk, some
for the third year, while sopho-
more women arein Cannon, Watts,
and Sentelle.

Junior Tommy Sutor and his
roommate Mark Hemby are living
in Belk for the third year and are
not happy about the situation, ac-
cording to Sutor. Although the
number of junior men: living in
Belk for the third year is unknown,
Sutor said there are a lot of them
and Belk was one of their last
choices to live.

Sutor thinks providing rooms
for women in Belk would give
junior men the opportunity to live
in other dorms. He says the prob-
lem they are having with housing
can be attributed to “RLO’s poor
planning and unpredictability of
the size of the freshman class.”

Belkdorm has not alwaysbeen
a male dorm and Richard Terry of
‘the Residence Life Office com-

"mented that the RLO is discussing,

co-ed options.

According to Terry, the RLO
is aware of the disappointment and
anger of the senior women unable
to get a room in Duke. Terry
explains one reason for this prob-
lem is the “offspring of the reten-
tion policy.” In the 1993 Lottery
Handbook the room retention
policy states that anyone, except

rising sophomores, can request by
April 2 to retain their room. How-
ever, this request can be denied if
the sex of the hall changes.

Two women retained their
rooms in Duke which limits the
number of rooms in Duke that are
available to seniors. “This policy
is not set in stone and can be re-
viewed. It is an older policy that
not many people have complained
about,” Terry explained. Terry
also commented that it is not pos-
sible tomake every new room avail-
able to everyone once the lottery
ends.

Senior Karen Marshall was
one of the women who did not get
a senior apartment or a room in
Duke and is now living in Pax.

She said that, to her, Duke
has been known as a dorm for
those seniors that do not get an
apartment.

There were only four men that

_ wanted a senior apartment and did

not receive one, but were able to
obtain housing in Duke. There are
two floors of men and one floor of
women in Duke. “It seems unfair
and weird to have two floors of
men when only four senior men

did not get an apartment,” said

Marshall. .

Terry expressed his concern
about both issues andwould appre-
ciate and welcome any sugges-
tions students have to resolve these
problems, “I hope students will
come to me with suggestions.”

Housing for upperclassmen
this year was 100% filled, even
with the addition of Lingle Man-
ner as a new residence hall. The
house across from Richardson
dorm, originally erected as a din-
ing hall, houses transfer students
and upperclassmen off the wait
list.

Davidson Village Inn

By Mary McCrory

When Rebecca Clark attended
Davidson eleven years ago, the
Guest House filled up just as
quickly as it does now. Seeing the
number of visitors in town for
Parent’s Weekend, Homecoming,
and Alumni Weekend convinced
her that the community had a real
need for more accommodations.
Even after moving to. California,
when she heard that local busi-
nessman Ed Harris was consider-
ing opening an inn, Rebecca Clark
was still interested. She and her
husband are now the innkeepers of
the Davidson Village Inn, currently
underconstruction on Depot Street.

Construction on the brick
building isnearingcompletion, and
they hope to open for business by
November 15. The Inn also plans
to have an open house on Decem-
ber 1, when the town begins its
Christmas celebration.

The inn will offer different

- amenities than the hotels and mo-

tels in Cornelius. The Clarks and
managing partner Ed Harris hope
to create a more cozy atmosphere
by serving afternoon tea and cof-
fee by the fire in the lobby. The 18

set to open in December

rooms will have four poster beds
and will be decorated in rich col-
ors. Besides standard rooms for
$85 per night, the inn will offer
suites with queen size beds and
kitchenettes including microwaves
and small refrigerators for $94.
Also, for those staying in town for
Thanksgiving or Christmas, the
rates go down to $50 per night.

_ For anyone looking for a
unique gift, the inn will make gift
certificates available and will also -
have special “Romantic Weekend”
packages which could include any-
thing from a bottle of champagne
in the room to fresh flowers, fruit,
and candles to a dinner at Le Trois
Faisans next door. Primarily, the
innkeepers want to cater to what-
ever their clientele might require
and are open to requests.

Already the inn has a few ad-
vance bookings, and the Clarks are
optimistic about the business. “A
few freshman parents have even
called to make reservations for
graduation four years from now,”
she said, surprised. The innkeep-
ers expect to be very busy on week-
ends, but also wish to attract cor-
porate business during the week.
