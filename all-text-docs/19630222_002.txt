Progress And The Committee

Sometime in the future, when a
student of Davidsoniana reviews the
history of the college, he will undoubt-
edly credit the institution with two
major accomplishments for the first
semester of the 196243 school year.

The first was the deceptively un-
obtrusive admission of a Negro as a
student of the college for the first
time. Davidson showed that it can
shed a tradition when it is proven
that that tradition is motivated by
something false and brittle.

The second accomplishment was
the new cut system, giving the stud-
ents unparalleled freedom and re-
sponsibility with regard to attending
classes. It now appears that the stud-
ents have maturely used their new
* freedom in all regards.

It is significant that the ground-
work for both of these achievements
was done under the auspices of that
oft-abused institution known as the
committee. In both cases. a committee
deserved the lion’s share of the ap-
plause. Committees may be ruled-off
pigeonholes. Committees may be used
as fronts for small ambitions. But this
time two committees came through
with the goods.

It should come as no surprise to
discover that committees, particularly
two, hold the keys to progress in the
coming semester. The Committee on
Religious Life and the Committee on
Fraternities and Social Life are now
considering aspects of required relig-
ious services and the drinking regula-
tions, respectively.

The issues the committees are
considering are similar in several re-
spects. Both are concerned with vital
areas of the college program. The
student body, as a whole, has made
its opinions about the issues clear.
Finally a major campus organization
has made a commitment in each case.

The seriousness of each problem
has been more than. met by the efforts
toward understanding on the part of
the students. The results of these ef-
forts are now in the hands of the com-
mittees. Clearly a word no less than
“trust” should be used to signify what
the students have brought to the com-
mittees.

Clearly then, we have a right to
expect that an adjective no less than
“major” will be used to’ describe the
ultimate accomplishments.

The Oath In Committee

Another committee. this time a
trustee committee, now holds the fate
of the faculty recommendation on the
oath in its hands. It appears that the
outcome will be a compromise of

. some sort.

One so-called ‘“‘compromise” that
appears likely to be enacted is making
the oath part of. the private hiring
process. This is called a compromise :
because one of the main objections to
the oath is its public administration.
But will it really change anything to
take the vow underground? Does this
mean that the faculty is willing to vow
in private what they won’t in public?
More important, the coupling of this
with the hiring process will leave no
room for the qualified dissenter on
the faculty. In any case, we hope that
the faculty and administration will
not cease their efforts until the oath
is abolished.

When a college goes out to re-
cruit professors, it is hard enough to
find the combination of a good aca-
demic background and a real ability
to teach. But you add the quality of
belief to these two, a quality that
many believe should be intensely per-
sonal, and you have narrowed your
field considerably,

There is something to be said
from the point of view of religion too.
By making belief a prerequisite of job
advancement. aren’t you lowering
Christianity to the level of a skill?

A story we recently heard is par-
tially applicable here. A bishop had a
sink that needed working on and had
a choice of two plumbers. One was an
excellent plumber but had the repu-
tation of being a devout atheist. The
other, a good Christian soul, was a
bad plumber. The bishop chose the
better plumber.

Needed: More Family Meetings

Unbounded enthusiasm is prob-
ably the most important ingredient
of success. It would seem to be the
case on this campus, a place where
success is frequently dependent on
student response. Indeed. we suspect
that many programs are begun with
little else especially when we realize
that voluntary programs just. don’t
make much sense to most students.

But we hope the freshmen. turn
out en masse to support just such a
program this Monday in the Union
from 9 to 10 p.m. At that time the
Union will attempt to hold a massive

Noted In Passing...

Denis Baly, the Danforth Lecturer
who visited the campus last week, had
an interesting opinion about required
religious services. He said, “I think
you should only require attendance
at a program that absolutely no one
should miss. But if the program is that
good, you won’t need to require at-
tendance.”

* s

Baly said that the trustees at
Kenyon College, Ohio unanimously
abolished compulsary religious serv-
ices a few years ago. Attendance drop-
ped off sharply the first year but,
through stimulating programs, it has
been built up again.

faculty-freshmen get-together. This is
certainly preferable to the impersonal
handshaking routine both groups in-
dulge in at the beginning of the year.

More important though is that, if
successful, such social affairs could be
extended to include all the classes in
the student body. In spite of conversa-
tions in Chambers and visiting after
vespers, there is still a gap in student-
professor relations. The energetic at-
tempts of Messrs. Shaw, Cole, and Co.
to use the Union to fill this gap de-
serve applause. And response.

Now Kenyon students are trying
to get rid of their limited cut system. .

It was interesting to note how fast
the Freshman Council dropped the
idea of making formal criticism of the
Union's food service as soon as the
second semester began.

Sounds as if someone put a pill
of forgetfulness in the fraternity

gravy.

One thing that required chapel
teaches us is Stoic resignation.

Notice that most people sat all
the way through the Stan Ruben
Concert.

NSA Can Help You Save

BY DUDLEY SALLEY
NSA Student Travel Representative

If one has already read Gadsby and Lord of the Flies
and done everything everybody else is doing, then. one
is no doubt going to the Continent this summer, and if
so, one should make some definite plans now rather than

‘Catch-22'... A Nightmare
Or A New Way Of Life?

BY BILL TROTTER

CATCH-22 (463 pp.)
JOSEPH HELLER SIMON
AND SCHUSTER, DELL
Hardbound ($5.95), Paperback
(S.75).

There is a catch of course
... Yossarian can be medically
excused from combat flying, but
first he must be diagnosed as
crazy ... but then, no one who
wants to be excused from com-
bat flying is crazy. This is a
part of the ruling. which gives
Joseph Heller's run-away sen-
sation of a bodk its title. The
characters strongly suspect that
Catch -22 does not exist in the
rule books, but that doesn’t mat
ter, because the world is set un
to enfsrce it anvwav. Another.
one of the rule's nrovisiars is
that the military have the cig tt
to do anything they can't be
stonped from doing.

CATCH-22 should be hanne 1.
It’s a dangerous book. No intel-
ligent person who reads it can
ever be the same again. It is a
dangerous book because it ques-
tions every aspect of author'tv,
of bureaucracy. of the military,
in fact, of just about every m1.
jor feature of modern society.
And the terribly doncerous
thing it does, is make them all
Jook as ridiculous as they are.

This book is more thar ‘st
a remarkable novel; it ic a
way 6f life. Philip Toynbee
has gone so far as to call it
“the greatest setirical work
in English since Erewhon.”’
Cleser to home, our own Dr.
W. F. Goodykoontz, center of
the devoted circle of Helter
fans on campus, proclaims the
work to be emong the fine<t
masterpieces of our time. He
has read it three times.

It would be impossible to at-
tempt to render the madly intri-
cate and super-imposed plot
structure into anything other
than its own terms. In general,

the novel is the story of Yossar-

ian, a young man flying as
bombardier in an American
Army Air Foree squadron in
Italy during the last year of the
War. His colonel continues to
raise the number of missions
the men must fly, resulting in
the slow mental and physical de-
terioration of their souls and
bodies.

From this normal-seeming
framework, Heller creates a
world of screaming madness,
junatical laughter, complex and

‘impossible situations which be-

come agonizingly real through
his skill as a writer. |

Ke writes pas‘ionately, — in-
tencely to the point of almost
“hhee'nes forec. his characters
dane avd beliow and howl
acress th pagrs—the action
rages with unflagging temo.
and the book hits hard, and hits
low. The reader soon forgets
that this is fantasy. surrealism,
soon stops trving to keep track
of the shifting and arbitrary
time-continuum, and begins to
accept this world as real.

Somewhere in the pages of
the book, the reader discovers
to his terror and amusement,
that it is real... that Heller has

shown us our society in a fun-

house mirror which focuses our
sight on the madness, the fool-
ishness, the ludicrous incon-
gruities, which lie beneath the
outer surface. The book juxta-
poses time, events, and char-
acters; themes recur and vanish
like melodic threads in a vast
symphony; the work is contra-
puntal, and all the elements of
its fugue reach a stunning cli-
max in the last fifty pages.

The predominant tone of
the book is humorous, and
Heller's humor is infinite in
tone and variety—it ranges
from blasphemous, savage, de-
vastating satire, to gentle and
tender irony. {t is bawdy, out-
rageous, and raw. tt is not a
polite book; but it is a pro-
found one.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Martin Hits Criticism
Of LaHarry Handling

Dear Editor:

Two reports in THE DAVID-
SONIAN on the visit of Mr.
Nitish LaHarry of India require
comment.

The article on page one criti-
cized the “Administration” for
“talking with him about the
many accomplishments of Dav-
idson” and the editorial criticiz-
ed the “Administration” for re-
questing several students to ask
prepared questions of Mr. La-
Harry.

Mr. LaHarry was brought to
Davidson a little before 10 o’-
clock Monday morning by Mr.
C, W. Gilchrist, .an alumnus of
Davidson and a director of Ro-
tary International. Mr. LaHarry
asked whether there could be a
question and answer period fol-

lowing a brief talk. I indicated
that this would be entirely sat-
isfactory but that we had not
had this type of assembly pro-
gram recently and that the ques-
tions might not come immed-
iately. He then asked if we
would have distributed several
questions which he prepared.

The only reference to David-
son’s accomplishments was by
Mr. LaHarry who said, “I under-
stand that Dean Rusk and Wood-
row Wilson were alumni of Dav-
idson,” to which I promptly re-
plied that Mr. Wilson was here
for only one year. It is perhaps
understandable. that a persun
from Asia would not compre-
hend the importance of his
“error.”

D. Grier Martin

‘terms ..

As the ending approaches,
Heller suddenly strips away the
humor, and for page after page,
shocking, drutal realism  re-
places the fantasy, realism hand-
led surrealistically, creating a
fantasy like a nightmare. In a
series of stark incidents, Heller
reveals the seriousness of his
hilarity. There is a message in
his madness.

His message has been sum-
med up flippantly by himself:
“This is a world where the keep-
ers are as looney as the in-
mates... “ Heller is grinding
an axe, openly, and without
apologies. For it is the heavy
axe all sensitive people must
carry in a world where brutality
and regimentation pass for
normalcy.

One by one, the author levels
his sights on capitalism, on
bureaucracy, on military stu-
pidity and narrowness, on pre-
tentious morality, and with
ruthless, inescapable _ satire,
blows them to pieces while the
reader watches, enthralled, de-
lighted, and aghast. CATCH-22
ought to be required reading for
all. politicians, educators, min-
isters, and, above all, for all

‘young men faced with military

service, especially as officers.

The real danger of the book,
and perhaps the most liberating
function it performs, is that the
reader finds himself beginning
to see the world in Heller's
. begins to see just
how bombastic and foolish so
much of it is, remembers that
Heller also shows how laughter
and decency can escape the ma-
chinations of a blind society,
and begins to wonder just how
much of it he can get away with
himself.

From
Harvard

Cambridge, Mass. — (1.P.) —
A new dormitary plan, to im-
prove freshman advising and to
increase informal give-and-take
between freshmen and faculty,
advisers, and intellectual and
civic leaders, will greet the
Class of 1966 when they arrive
in Harvard Yard this fall.

For advising and for informal
intellectual activities, the 15
freshman dormitories will be
organized into five units, each
with about 200 to 250 freshmen
as members. A Senior Adviser
will direct each unit, with the
assistance of hall proctors and
faculty associates.

Each unit will have its own
common room, as a center for
informal discussions and meet-
ings, and each unit will have its
own program of activities. Of-
fices are provided for the use of
non-resident: advisers. Many of
the discussions will center on
two subjects of perennial im-
portance to freshmen — the
choice of a major field of study
and the choice of a career.

The resident Senior Adviser
in each unit will act as an as-
sistant dean for the students in
the unit. The reorganization has
been designed to improve the
advising of freshmen as well as
to increase informa! intellectual
activity during the freshman
year.

The student council desires to help Davidsonians in
this venture make their contribution to the gold drain as
insignificant as possible and has made available the less
expensive Educational Travel programs. The programs
are coordinated with European student unions, are co-ed,
and non-profit making. They range from general tours
designed to “contrast the miraculous spirituality of Mont-
Saint-Michel and Chartres with the brilliant sophistication
of Paris and the Riviera’ for $750, plus transportation in
little letters, to “Hobo” itineries for about half that if one

likes Dutch cheese.

There are several university-sponsored special

Study groups. The one

in France combines two

weeks of family living in Normandy with another
four in more formal studv at the Sorbonne in Paris.
In Florence a Bucknell University group will stay
in a near-by villa for six weeks to study the art and
architecture of the Renaissance citv and of other

parts of Italy.

Several other universities offer study-travel pro-
grams to Music and Art Festivals, and in the fields of
European Communications and Politics and Economics.

If, however, one desires to do something everybodv
else is doing only moreso, the NSA has a 41-day expedi-
tion to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, which
should make one something of an oddity, and place him
in great demand for speaking engagements with local
Rotary Clubs and we-love-everybody rallies, ‘as well as

on the

DAR black list. (It is possible that quality points

may be given for this as Eco 1984.)

There are also groups off to South America,
Greece, and Israel, and one off to everywhere all at
once called the “Whirlwind.”

NSA publishes the Handbook on Student Travel, a
guide to student hostels and general price concessions
available to students in 28 countries. Work, Study, Trave!
Abroad is also available. The annual publication is a
comprehensive guide to individual travel, educational
tours, summer sessions and seminars abroad, scholar-
ships, work camps, transportation, and sundry quaint
customs. The Traveling Student is a listing of intra-
European charter transportation.

The NSA is also the issuing agent for the Interna-

tional Student ID cards, which if they weighed more
would be worth their weight in gold in free admissions

and discounts.

A film’s tone depends on its
subject, its treatment, or a com-
bination of these. In JULES
AND JIM, next week’s movie
feature at the Union, French
director Francois Truffaut has
created a lighthearted comedy
out of a potentially sad tale.

Jules, an Austrian, and Jim, a
Frenchman, are Bohemian com-
rades sharing their money, rec-
reation, and girl friends in the
carefree Paris of 1912. Their
communal relationship is ended
when Jules falls in love with
and marries a passionately im-
pulsive French girl, Catherine.
Jim, with similar taste, covets
his companion’s wife, but keeps
himself respectfully discreet.

World Wer 1 forces the two
men into opposing foxholes,
and each fears he may have
killed the other. They both
survive and plan a reunion.

Jim visits Jules, Catherine,

and their daughter in Ger-

many. There he discovers that

Catherine has taken several

lovers but that Jules is satis-

fied as long as she remains
with him. Not to miss the
bandwagon, Jim begins (with

Jules’ knowledge) his own af-

fair with Catherine. The dis-

solution of this novel arrange-
ment is the subject of the
final portion of the flim.

This story might read like 2
chapter from “Young Doctor
Malone Tours Europe,” but un-
der the spontaneous and en-
thusiastic handling of Truffaut
JULES AND JIM emerges as
tragedy turned gaiety or drama
turned fantasy. The whimsical
results are as delightful as ado-
lescent affairs could possibly be.

Yet the pace is at times exu-
berant to the point of structural
weakness (e.g. comic incidents
may get more attention than
their relation to the subject war-
rants). Such a lack of unity is
prevented by three excellent
performances that blend the
director’s enjoyable extremes
into a plausible range and
strength the unexpected cli-.
max of the story.

Throughout its giddy develop-
ment JULES AND JIM retains
a comic flavor and, though the
final event questions the light
abandon of our smile, its humor
is genuine. Truffaut has at-
tempted a unique and happy tilt
to the eternal triangle, and he
has skillfully achieved it.
