IFC Poll Questions
Current Rush Policy

The Interfraternity Council is conducting a poll
among all fraternity members and pledges next week
as part of its current study of the rush program on
campus.

In their recent meetings, both the IFC and the fra-
ternity presidents have been discussing possible alterna-
tives to having Rush Week the first week of the semester.
The poll will solicit opinion on various delayed rush pro-
grams.

Fraternity pledges will fill in the questionnaires
at their meetings Tuesday night, IFC President Bob
Waugh reported. Other fraternity members will be given
the poll at the reguiar Thursday meetings.
