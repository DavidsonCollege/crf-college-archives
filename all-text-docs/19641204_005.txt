BELLS TOLL FOR DOLE

Bill Tate, Wake Forest’s football saviour, recently
said of his occupation as a coach, “The only basis on
which you are a success in this business is winning.”

One may or may not agree, but such a philosophy}
has transformed a Wake Forest team that was little more}

than a joke last year to a winner of five games and a

team capable of beating anyone in the Atlantic Coast}

Conference.

| don’t know whether or not Davidson’s problem has
been the coach — time will tell. But it was evident that
something had to be done. Davidson can win and I think
we will win.

it had been evident for some time that a change was
forthcoming and that somebody might get hurt. It may
have been necessary, but I can’t help but be sorry that
a nice person like Coach Dole had to be hurt. |

That he is generally liked by almost everyone is no |
misrepresentation — any criticism of him I’ve ever heard |
has been of his coaching or his recruiting program. I’ve
never heard anything against him personally.

As a personal representative of Davidson, he was a
credit to the college . . . but he didn’t win.

finished yet.

LOOSE ENDS...

The Student Council and Athletic Director Tom Scott
worked out an arrangement yesterday whereby the gym
will be kept open for student use on week nights for the
entire year. ;

Evidently, all campaign promises aren’t hollow—Bill
Council promised in his platform last year to try to ob-
tain such an arrangement and was instrumental in work-

ing out the plans with Dr. Scott. Both deserve credit for
fulfilling a need that has existed for a long time.

Offensive halfback Steve Smith and defensive end
Pack Hindsley recently received honorable mention on |
the All-Southern Conference football team. I guess it is
a result of not playing but four conference games, but
both should have made All-Conference, especially since
an offensive team and a defensive team were selected.

There isn’t a pm gl defensive end than Hindsley
in the conference, and it’s hard to justify omitting the
conference’s leading ground gainer from its all-confer-

ence squad. :

All-Conference teams have been chosen since 1933,
but guard Dick Johnson, who made the squad in 1936,
is the only Davidson player ever to have received the
honor.

Smith and quarterback Steve Heckard did make the
Scholastic All-Conference team. A “B” average is neces-
sary for nomination to the squad and Davidson led the
conference with 18 nominations.

Conference basketball teams have dropped 8 of their

10 games against outside opponents so far—it looks like
they'll have trouble maintaining the 49-35 record they
compiled against non-members last year. |

Rated fourth in the nation by the AP poll, third by)
UPI and Basketball Magazine, and as best in the land by |
Sports Illustrated, the Davidson Wildcats are getting their
full share of recognition this winter.

VMI won't play us in football anymore, but they are |
probably glad they did this year. The Keydets’ Thanks- |

Bones Provides Show
In ‘Cat-Deac Contest

Maybe the new rule benching
coaches was a restraint. But
Horace (Bones) McKinney show-
ed few inhibitions Tuesday night
as he watched his Deacons drop
an opening lead and then the
game to Davidson's Wildcats.
95-88.

Tall, lanky Bones was raring
to go: as the Davidson ROTC
color guard marched onto the
court to present the colors, the
Wake Forest coach entertained
his team by mimicking the ama-
teur soldiers with the McKinney
“double time."’ mumbling all
the while ‘Let's get this thing on
the road.”

While his plump cohort—huff-
ing and puffing—remained seat
ed on the edge of tue bench, the

| quasi cheerleader was _ yelling,
“He kicked the ball... . come
on... come on. ... defense,
defense .. .”

But as ‘‘defense, defense”

failed to keep the ‘Cats from
taking the lead about midway
through the first half, Bones
shouted to his high scoring star
Bob Leonard, ‘‘Come on, Rob-
ert, rock and roll, gol doggit.”
muttering more snarling phras-

es with each cali of the offi-|
cials.

His only distractions were two
exchanges with spectators:

After one of the seemingly in-|
cessant bad calls, a Davidson!
matron shouted to the dismayed |
McKinney: “‘Simmer down, old |
boy, everybody gets a bad call)
every now and then.”

Retorted the coach, noticing
her front-row seat: “Did you
pay to come in here?”

Moments later, in the midst
of another: furious utterance, the
coach detected a shout from yet
another Davidson fan: ‘‘There's
nothing wrong with that call.”

Wheeling about with eyes
flashing, McKinney bellowed:
“You wouldn't say that if you
were watching the ball game!"

Only once did the Deacon!
coach display his most energet-
ic trademark: with flaming de
termination he threw his towel}
straight up, glaring as it drifted}
back down.

Then realizing the laughter
from behind him, he turned|
around, flashed a quick sheepish |
grin, and sat down slowly. With |
five minutes left, Davidson had}
a 14-point lead.

Coach Bill Dole, after 13
seasons as head coach for

the Davidson Wildcats, re-

his position last Fri-
day afternoon.

Dole, who has not. had a win-
ning season since 1958, report-
edly tendered his resignation
under pressure. The action was
preceded by several weeks of
' speculation in the press about
Dole’s future; the coach re-
peatedly stated that he would
not resign. Announcement of
the resignation came shortly
after Dole met with Athletic Di-
rector Tom Scott and President
D. Grier Martin.

:

“The college has accepted
Coach Dole’s resignation with
| regrets and full appreciation for
his services during the past
years.’’ announced Dr. Martin
“The college has made provi
sion for Coach Dole to continue
a member of the Davidson
education department

Dole said, “I have enjoyed

my 12 years at Davidson, and I
am proud of the boys I brought

{to the school who are now doc-

tors. lawyers, ministers, and

successful businessmen.”

“I am not sure of my future
I would like to remain in the
coaching field, but I have no
definite plans.”

A columnist for a South Caro-
lina newspaper quoted Dole:
“What I want now is an as
sistant’s coaching job. I am not
naive enough to think, with my
record at Davidson, they'll be
jumping. over any barrels to
give me a head .coaching job.

“‘Head coaching jobs are giv-
en on records and people seem
to believe in them. They don't
hire on whether a man has the
capabilities or not but on how

|} many games he has won or lost.

I know that so I know I'll have
to make an adjustment and be-
assistant coach some
where.

“T think I could help any staff
as an assistant. I love football
coaching. It's my way of life

| and I really don’t know any oth-

er. An assistant coaching job,
therefore, is my only alterna-
tive."

Dole, 55, came to Davidson in
1952 after successful coaching in
high school and at East Caro-
lina College. He has a lifetime
record of 151-111-9, but he has
been unable to produce a win-
ning Wildcat squad since 1958.
Since that date his coaching
mark has been 15-33-3, and the

‘Cats have won only one of
their last 13. games in the
Southern Conference.
Davidson's comparatively
small number of available schol-
arships has been cited often by
Dole as an hindrance to devel-
oping a winning team. The total
of 40 scholarships allotted foot-
ball is smallest of any South-
ern Conference teams, and Dole
felt that it was not large enough

to produce a strong competitor
in the conference.

On the other hand, there had
been criticism of Dole for “‘not
making effective use of what he
had." It had been charged that
his recruiting program was not
maintained at a high level. An-
other complaint was that some
of the best ball players on the
squad were not being pushed to
give their best effort.

Wide Search Begins
For Dole Replacement

By SAM BOYTE
Davidsonian Sports Writer
The search is now on to

find a replacement for Da-
vidson’s former head foot-

ball coach Bill Dole.

“It's wide open.” said Ath-
letic Director Tom Scott, “‘and
we're receiving applications.”

Approximately 40 men. includ
ing both high school and col-
lege coaches, have applied for
the position. A majority have
had experience as_ assistant
coaches at various colleges.

Scott is pleased with the re-
sponse: “There are some fine
men applying. It'll be a problem
choosing among all the applica-
tions.”

“Personally I'd like to keep
it open a couple of weeks and
then start screening in order to
give everyone a chance to ap-
ply.

“Some men in whom the col-
lege is interested will be con-
tacted regardless of whether or
not they apply for the job.”

All of the applicants are to

be examined carefully before
a decision is made. The. appli-
cations are. being handled con-
fidentially in. order to avoid
embarrassment to some who
are applying without. notifica
tion to. their present schools

and to those who will eventu-
ally be rejected.

Among possibilities frequent-
ly mentioned is present assis-
tant. Tom Stevens who made

Swimming Hopes Look Bright

“Yes,” commented swim-
ming coach Dwight Shue, “I
definitely feel that barring
unforeseen happenings we
will have a_ stronger
swimming team than last
year’s, even though we'll be
relying a great deal on soph-
omores.”

Shue went on to say that since
only one ran, Bud Fry, on the
1963-64 team was a senior, the
tankmen will be able to begin
the season on Monday, Decem-
ber 7, with a certain amount

of experience.

Concerning individual mem

tain to be a tough match for
the Wildcats.

The tentative lineup is:
