felt that Davidson’s high admis-
sion standards and excessive work
load make socializing difficult.
Another student pinned the prob-
lem on the campus’s isolation. He
argued that many students don’t
have cars and the town doesn’t
offer much entertainment. _
Still another panelist blamed

Patterson Court. She asked: “Why -

ask someone on a date when you
know that you are going to bump
into them on the Court? Alcohol
and loud music don’t facilitate
good conversation. If you meet
someone at a party on the court,
the relationship is doomed.”
After those questions, the fo-
rum opened up to the audience for
discussion. Some of the panelists

and many Ltd 4 the audi-
ence attributed Davidson’s strange
social scene to its small size. They
argued that, because there are only
about 1,500 students, everyone
knows everyone else’s business.

A female panelist claimed
that a date is interpreted by peers
as an immediate serious relation-
ship: “There is no such thing as a
get-to-know each other phase here.
You are either hooking up or seri-
ously involved.”

Another panelist said that
people at Davidson are too con-
cerned with what their friends think
ofthem. Mrs. Kimmel then asked:
“But isn’t hooking up more gos-
sip-worthy than going on a date?”
Most panelists agreed that is wasn't.

Audience members were
quick to offer various solutions to

satisfies few

the dating problem. Dr. David
Staton of the Student Counselling
Center suggested computer dates
be set up for the entire campus at a
band party . Audience members
suggested that coed dorms for
freshmen would improve gender
relations by facilitating brother-
sister relationships. Others sug-
gested that if all of the campus ate
together, dating situations would
improve. Another person had the
idea for a personals section in The
Davidsonian.

The forum provided an open
arena for speculation on
Davidson’s dating scene and the
participation was phenomenal.
However, there were so many dif-
ferent perspectives, the audience
agreed it was nearly impossible to
find the heart of the problem.

Guest speaker reveals prejudices of the Met

Museum continued from page 10

they offered nothing more than
replications of rooms of the ex-
tremely wealthy.

Duncan expressed that the
rooms were not arranged art his-
torically or even chronologically,
but instead presented a hodge-
podge of what a particular sponsor
owned in a replica of the room in
which the works were originally
shown.

Art works were often judged
not upon their aesthetic value, but
for the “sole reason that someone
owned them.” As a result, in
Duncan’s opinion, the art histori-
cal significance was “overshad-
owed by ownership.”

On some occasions, Duncan
revealed that entire ballrooms and
living rooms were reproduced to
display asponsor’s work. Duncan
notes that many museums simply
“present socially privileged mo-
ments of the past. . .in the luxuri-
ous rooms of noblemen.”

Duncan cited an incident at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in which a Jewish member of the
board was denied the seat of presi-
dent of the museum. After form-
ing his own private gallery, they
were able to lure him back as a

sponsor by making him an honor-
ary president—on one condition:
a wing be established in his
memory, a massive pyramid which
Duncan felt is “suggestive of an
ancient tomb for some great pha-
raoh.” The interior of this ostenta-
tious wing was to contain seven
chambers, a replication of the seven
rooms in which the paintings were
stored in his home.

Politics. Money. A Public
Museum. According to Professor
Shaw Smith, Duncan “reads mu-
seums as a production of class in-
terest.”

Duncan did cite some attempts
to accomplish what the museum
expresses as its ultimate aim. She
noted that industrialist J. P. Mor-
gan, while serving as president of
the Met from 1907 through 1913,
perceived how the museum could
serve as a “democratizing force.”
The former owner of US Steel once
said, “A man has two reasons for
doing things: a good one and a real
one.” Duncan suggested he felt
that museums were subscribing to
that belief.

Morgan thus envisioned “a
more civilized, moral, and peace-
ful museum,” which could be of-
fered to the “self-improving” citi-
zen. The Met thus began to be

arranged historically and could
actually be used to educate. Alas,
his ideals did not remain for long,
as the elite continued to “advance
the cause of WASP supremacy.”
The museum subsequently ceased
to function as “civic ritual space,”
but served as “territories of promi-
nent families.”

According to Professor Smith,
Duncan presented a lecture which
“encourages good questions.”
After the lecture, inquired, “Well,
aren’t we elitist? Where do college
students, professors with PhDs, and
art critics fit in? What exactly
would this egalitarian ritual space
offer? How would this be accom-
plished?”

Posing Carol Duncan with
these questions, she responded, “I
don’t have the answers. Halfofthe
answer comes from recognizing
the problem and being able to ask
those questions.”

Professor Ligo notes that
Duncan exposes the “democratic
myth in museums” and reveals how
sponsors “glorify themselves as
royalty.” In exposing the demo-
cratic myth in museums, Duncan
revealed the democratic myth in
general, leaving the student to walk
away from her lecture asking the
same questions about our society.

Censorship abounds in the arts

Censor continued from page 10

its inseparable relationship be-
tween the Lord and Jesus Christ,
has instilled within modern soci-
ety a direct connection between an
image and the ideal. This link al-
lows for further prejudice when
approaching the visual arts. As a
result, works are often evaluated
as something that they aren’t.

To demonstrate how these el-
ements combine to censor art,
Smith provided the audience with
slides of particular.works by.noted
artists (that he wittily pointed out
can also lead to a misinterpretation
of the real work). For example,
Manet’s “Olympia,” which depicts
aconcubine and her servant, dem-
onstrates how the artist can act as
censor for the viewer. Due to the
artist’s discretion, nowhere is any
male counterpart (save that of cer-
tain viewers) even suggested in
this painting.

In addition, Smith compared
the current Davidson College tele-
phone directory toits Lichtenstein
prototype, in order to unveil rea-

sons for why one would feel a need
to censor such material. Senior
Molly Johnson aptly pointed out
that the low-cut dress and the long,
red nails of the woman on the di-
rectory might be offensive tosome,
despite the fact that there may have
been little intent on the part of the
artist to upset the viewer.

Similar comparisons were
made among other works in an
effort to examine further tenden-
cies toward censorship. Particular
works by Caravaggio and Robert
Mapplethorpe (both controversial
pieces for their time) pointed out
that the artist often challenges the
viewer to redefine his or her atti-
tudes towards particular subjects.
Rather than rejecting the content
of a painting at first glance, Smith
implored his audience to try to
understand the artists’ intent in re-
lation to individual perspectives.

Smith’s discussion left the au-
dience with a fresh attitude to-
wards evaluating the visual arts.
Moreover, he suggested an inno-
vative approach that allows for
further individual reflection.
