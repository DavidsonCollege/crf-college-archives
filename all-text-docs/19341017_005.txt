Don Bailey, who was issued a bid pre-
viously, was taken through the formal

ceremonies of the Chapter Thursday

active member. After the initiation,

Bailey was requested tb give a five min-
ute talk on a subject’of paramount im-
portance, “Terpsichorean Activities As
Observed at the Famous Ritz Club in
Charlotte”. Pleading that he had no ex-
perience and an insufficient knowledge of
the subject, he announced his intentions
to retire but wes prompted by the older
members to give a detailed account of
the Ritz Club social functions on Satur-
day nights.

In regard to the plans of the Alpha
Phi Epsilon fraternity, R. H. Smith, Jr.,
president, stated, “a committee has been
appointed for the purpose of drawing up
concrete plans as to the method Alpha
Phi Epsilon will pursue in becoming ac-
tive and interesting during the coming
year”, A tentative schedule of the trips
to be taken to universities and colleges
throughout the States to be taken by
members of the debating team will be
drawn up in the near future.

A brief talk was made by Walter
Sprunt, Jr, on the “Public Speaking
Course” taken during the past summer at
the Columbia University Summer
School. He explzined the correct. eti-
quette applied by leading orators and de-
bators as taught at Columbia University.

Two other short impromptu speeches
were delivered by Bob Coit and Mims
Rogers on the outstanding books and
magazines read during the summer, A
detailed account of several books on
Philosophy composed Coit’s”’ talk while
Rogers gave a concise resume of the new
book, Stars Fall on Alabama, which was
published recently, ;

All the students members of Alpha
Phi Epsilon fraternity attended the feed,
presented by the Chapter. The feed,
which took place after the regular busi-
ness of the Chapter had terminated, con-
sisted of sandwiches, cakes and other
dainties.

ceptional ability and interest in public
