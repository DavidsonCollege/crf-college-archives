THE DAVIDSONIAN

_OPINIONS,

MONDAY, APRIL 7, 1997 1b

It’s been said that art imitates
life and that life imitates art. As far
as I can tell, these are both pretty
much true.

A more far-reaching and uni-
versal truth of the human condition
often goes unstated: idiots imitate
idiots, boneheads imitate
boneheads, and the banal imitate
the banal. Now you might be say-
ing that I’m rude for saying this, but
we all know it’s true.

Consider bell bottoms, polyes-
ter, wearing a white glove on one
hand, ““Where’s the beef?’”, jackets
covered in zippers, parachute pants,
super-fat shoelaces (untied, of
course), Dungeons & Dragons, glam
rock, grunge, “Whoomp, there it
is,” Joe Camel, suburban body pierc-
ing, Top 40 music, No Fear, and the
popularity of Beast Lite when
Stroh’s is roughly the same price
and a far superior brew.

Anybody who’s ever seen two
dozen pledges — or any clique,
including groups of independents
— wearing their hats sideways or
saying the same dumb phrase over
and over or any other dumb stuff
just because one of them started
doing it can testify to this truth.

Another example is the great
masses who converge on video
stores to get the hot movie of the
week. I worked in a video store for
a couple of years, and I can’t tell
you how many times I’d have some

dumb customer asking me, “Do you
have anything good?” or “What’s
really popular right now? Are there
any copies in?” Hell, when you go
to a video store and find that every
last copy of The Glimmer Man and
Tales From the Crypt: Bordello of
Blood is checked out strictly be-
cause they’ re new, you’ ll agree with
me for sure.

Of course, I’m not immune to
this syndrome, and aside from body
piercing, grunge, No Fear, and the
foolish decision to guzzle Beast Lite
instead of Stroh’s, I’ve pretty much
done everything mentioned above.
I’m sure that you’re familiar with
all of these too, so don’t try to act
like you haven’t succumbed.

Now if you think about some
of the events on campus lately, I’m
sure that you’ll find quite a few
instances. Just in case you’re not
too perceptive, let me give you some
examples.

I spent 1994 at the University
of Tennessee and had plenty of Tri
Delt and A-D-Pi friends. Watching
them practicing being cool sothey’d
be accepted by the sisters and then,
once they were accepted, running
around saying, “Delta Delta Delta,”
always put a snide grin on my face.
And that’s all I have to say about
that.

Another wonderful example of
trendiness and banality is the sec-
ond annual battle for IVCF’s char-

ter. As far as I’m concerned, all

‘parties involved—except for the

Dean of Students office and some
other school officials—are guilty
as charged of ‘playing follow the
leader.

Now I won’t get into the intri-
cacies of what it means to be a
fundamentalist, but it takes quite a
bit of willpower to accept blindly
what you’re taught, regardless of
the fact that biblical literalism
doesn’t make too much sense. Just
trust me on this one—I’ve been
there, and being in the position of
buying into a worldview that seems
blind and illogical but claims abso-
lute truth is a pain in the ass. Need-
less to say, I’ ve tossed this view out
in bits and pieces over the course of
the past few years.

The other side of the coin is just
as blind and banal; however. When
you have a student government that
is willing to throw religious free-
dom into the pisser because it means
recognizing unpopular and unattrac-
tive beliefs as true religious ideals
and not hatred, there’s a pretty seri-
ous case of the imitation principle
going on. When you have more
than a couple of SGAers saying,
“Yes, I know about religious lib-
erty, but I disagree with their be-
liefs, and so do plenty of other
people, so they must be invalid, and
if religious beliefs are invalid, we
don’t have to recognize them as

legitimate religious beliefs,” guess
what syndrome you’re witnessing.
Ofcourse, the most heartbreak-
ing aspect of the debate was what it
revealed about how skewed the pri-
orities of SGA’s older members are.
The discussion lasted well into
Twenty-One-Year-Old Night, and
I didn’t see anybody leave the Con-
ference Room to join us—the few,
the proud, the apathetic—in the 900
Room until the meeting was over.
Another banal brouhahais cen-
tered around religious controversy.
This year, there haven’t been too
many arguments about them, but
the crosses and the strife that they
inevitably cause is yet another shin-
ing example of people with too much
time on their hands imitating people
with too much time on their hands.
At’ Easter for the past three
years, concerned campus Christians
have erected their crosses to reach
out to the lost heathen among us. It
has never really struck me as a par-
ticularly loving or effective form of
sharing one’s faith, which is prob-
lematic since Jesus claimed that
loving your neighbor is the most
important principle of living.
Every year, though, people
erect the wooden monuments, and I
suspect that it has something to do
with the fact that they have heard
what a good idea it is by people
whose other brilliant claims to fame
have included the angry declaration

that evolution shouldn’t be taken so
seriously, the Statement Veteran’s
Day should be observed since Mar-
tin Luther King’s birthday is ob-
served and since veterans are a hell
of a lot more important than MLK, |
the cry that cheerleaders are our
greatestresource and should be hon-
ored more, and an earth-shattering
essay stating that the racial problem
in America is because MLK is dead,
as opposed to the possibility that it
might be caused by hundreds of
years of the oppression of one race
by another.

The people who protest the
crosses’ existence are just as dumb,
though. Sure, the display is an
eyesore, but saying that people have
no right to put it up makes about as
much sense as saying that Huckle-
berry Finn should be banned be-
cause you don’t like its language.

There are also plenty of non-
Davidson examples, such as the
Heaven’s Gate morons’ mass sui-
cide a couple of weeks ago and the
County Commission’s decision to
stop funding the Arts and Science
Council to stop the spread of homo-
sexuality in Charlotte. The deci-
sion was aptly made on April Fools’
Day.

This week, take a good look
around, examine everything closely,
and see how widespread my prin-
ciple is. Hell, you might even find
it in yourself; I know I have.

Much about the college expe-
rience deals with learning about
other cultures and figuring out the
validity of stereotypes. However,
as Hindus on campus, we have

The Truth about Hinduism

After worshipping God with form,
the Hindu progresses to perceiving
Him as formless. :

Third, many people find the
prominent vegetarianism practiced
among Hindus to be strange. They
wonder if it has a basis in the fact
that Hindus believe “they might be
eating a relative or ancestor that
reincarnated into the animal.” The

Many peoplealso believe Hin-
duism is based on “mythological”
stories. For example, there. are
books in the library titled “Hindu
Mythology.” These books char-
acterize the two major Hindu ep-
ics, the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata, as folk stories on
par with Paul Bunyan or Johnny
Appleseed. We consider these sto-

those who wish to gain
a more accurate un-
derstanding of it.
First, on the sur-
face, it appears Hin-
duism is polytheistic.
However, we believe
in the existence of one

ries to be historical
“events. If the story of
Christ were portrayed
in a similar manner, it
would be considered
sacrilegious. Overall,
Hinduism is an inclu-
sive religion. There is

God who is multifac-
eted and all-pervasive. Because of
His omnipresence, omnipotence,
and omniscience, we worship nu-
merous gods who represent these
many qualities that would fall un-
der that original conception. For
example, Brahma is the creator,
Vishnu is the preserver, and Siva is
the destroyer. In addition, numer-
ous other deities represent such
traits and goals as knowledge,
wealth, and good fortune. Yet our
basic belief is that these gods col-
lectively symbolize one God.
Second, many people think
Hindu idol worshipping to be
primitive. However, the worship
of idols is symbolic of the personal
relationship a Hindu devotee shares
with God. Idols also serve as the
object of contemplation in the ini-
tial stages of meditative practice.

practice actually stems from the
belief that Hindus believe that God
has a presence in everything and in
all forms of life. A divine respect is
given to all creatures. To butcher
them when it is unnecessary is
viewed as inappropriate. Mahatma
Gandhi’s belief in non-violent re-
sistance stemmed from this.
Along these lines, people mis-
understand the respect Hindus give
to cows. This special status is due
in part to Krishna’s affection for
cows and in part to the role cows
have played in the sustenance of
Hindu societies. Quite simply, they
have provided milk, transportation,
and fertilizer since the beginning of
Indian society. There were an inte-
gral part and source of life for com-
munities, and that contribution is
recognized by respecting them.

no mandate for devo-
tees to convert others to it. Those
who do not believe in it are not
believed to be condemned or
doomed to a hellish fate. On the
contrary, a good Hindu is taught to
respect other religions and even
believe in the divinity of other
messengers of God (like Christ,
Mohammed, and Buddha).

We hope you have learned
about some of the similarities and
differences between Hinduism and
the other major world religions.
While the topics we discussed in
no way give a complete view of
the religion, we do hope it in-
formed people enough to know
the basics. We invite everyone to
come to the religion forum tomor-
