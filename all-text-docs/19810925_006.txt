Work-study positions
on the decline

by Boe Young ‘83

The College employs 160 word-
study students this year, 34 students
fewer than it employed last year on the
work-study program.

The maximum number of hours al-
lotted to students per week rose from 10
hours last year to. this year’s levels of
12.5 hours for freshmen and: 15 hours
for upperclassmen.

The number of “regular work” em-
ployees whose financial aid comes from
the College as a loan rose from 71 to
107.

As.a_result-of large Congressional

budget cuts in stsudent aid programs,
administrators have been forced to use

College funds to fincance a large per-

centage of loan and work-study pro-

grams.

_ According to Admissions Director
John Griffeth, the buudget cuts: forced
significant changes in the operation oft
he aid program.

In the past the College has assisted

-students with all of their financial needs.

The three tiered assistance program in-
volves scholarships, direct loans, and
work-study. .

Formerly virtually all loan money
and nearly 80 percent ofall work-study
finances were supplied by the govern-

ment. With the budget reductions the -

Loans that the College received was sig-

nificantly reduced while the work-study

program was placed ina “non-growth”
Status.

Consequently the College had-only

enough funds to finance upperclassmen.
A new loan fund for.freshmen had
to be created out of a College money
pool called the Endowment Scholarship
Fund. The Endowment Scholarship
Fund is made up of endowments and in-
vestments. Money from the fund had to
be allocated to the work-study program.

The old Union Snack Bar disap-
peared over the summer and the College
Dining. Service created a Union Café in
its place. Dining Service Director Carl-
ton Pritchard said the café is the most

exciting project he’s worked on at Da-.
vidson. THe most obvious change from '

the old Snack Bar is that now customers
serve themselves instead of ordering ev-
erthing over the counter. Café manager

- Nancy Heisel said the self-service sys-

tem moves people through faster, so
lines, do not get as long as they did with

.the old stystem. M' Pritchard said under:
the new system customers receive their

grill orders more quickly.

The café features new food as well
as a new service line. The café offers an
assortment of Sealtest ice creams,

due to lack of work and overcrowding in

~ her department. Another sophomore,

-- Jenny O’Briant voiced the same com-

plaint of being underworked. Yet both
felt that their work load will increase as

school progresses.

Despite the financial squeeze,
Griffith emphasized that the College has
been able to maintain the same scholar-
ship to self-help ratio as last year.

He added that it is a great “burden”
for the College to continue to use the
Endowment Scholarship Fund for fresh-
men loans and work-study.

sherbets and frozen yogurt. Nancy said
she expects to get bienders for shakes
and fancy fruit drinks: She arranges to
have a different luncheon special every
day. The Dining Service is going to re-
decorate: the café sometime before
Christmas. Nancy said the decorations
will reflect the café’s name, or at least
bring in some bright color. She said she
welcomes student input into decorating
plans and also menu selection. ;

- The Union Café has different hours
than the Snack Bar did. The café opens
at 9:30 am and closes with the Union.
Mealcards may not be used after 4:30,

- however.

Managing the Union Café is Nan-
cy’s first job out of college. She gradu-
ated in, Food Systems Management
from the University ‘of Missouri last
year.
