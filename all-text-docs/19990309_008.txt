It wasn’t supposed to turn out this
way for the Wildcats.

But it did.

In the quarter finals of the South-
ern Conference tournament, Davidson
lost 82-77 to Western Carolina, the worst
team in the Southern Conference. The
Catamounts (7-20) entered the game
with only three previous wins against
Division I teams with the most previous
win the night before, also coming in
upset fashion against the higher seeded
Wofford Terriers.

Davidson had faced coach Phil
Hopkin’s squad twice during the regu-
lar season and each occasion ended
with aromp. On January 16, Davidson
won 96-59 and the Wildcats again turned
back the Catamounts, 73-55, in early
February.

These losses did not mean any-
thing to the hot shooting Western play-
ers on that Friday afternoon.

Dondrell Whitmore and Michael
Plavich paced the Catamounts with
smooth ‘strokes from behind the arc.
They combined for 44 points, 30 of
those coming from three point baskets.
Whitmore, a forward, hit four of his five
three point attempts. Plavich continu-
ally bailed out his teammates, throwing
up desperation shots which always
seemed to find the net.

“(Davidson’s) zone actually al-
lowed us torun some clock, and Michael
Plavich hit a couple of big ones for us,”
said Coach Hopkins. “He had struggled
the last couple of games, but he hit some
big shots today.”

Coach Bob McKillop’s squad
again struggled to complete the entire
forty minutes of the game. The final

Press RELEASE

Jason E. Prince, a Davidson stu-
dent leader and varsity swimmer from
Boise, Idaho, is a USA Today “All-
USA Academic All-American.” Pic-
tures and profiles of Prince and the
other 19 winners appeared in the Thurs-
day, February 25, edition of USA To-
day. nationwide.

Prince said, “It’s a tremendous
honor to be recognized for those things
I’ve enjoyed doing at Davidson — ser-
vice, studies, and sports. I’m excited
about the recognition it'll bring to
Davidson, and looking forward to meet-
ing the other winners.”

The Award

The winners were to gather in
Washington, D.C., on Thursday and
Friday for an awards banquet and a
“Presidential Roundtable” discussion
with university presidents and past USA
Today winners about the state of higher
education. The winners represent
(among other institutions) Carnegie
Mellon University, Wake Forest, Yale,
Columbia, Harvard, Duke and the Uni-

game of the season seemed reminiscent
of earlier losses against Colgate and
College of Charleston, where the Wild-
cats were unable to put the opponent
away.

Leading 63-54 with 9:43 left on
the clock, Davidson appeared to finally
have the game in hand, but they did not
score for the next four minutes allowing
the confident Catamounts back into the
game.

This game is just another example
of us not being able to put the finishing
touches on games this year,” said Coach
McKillop.

As ateam Western shot 54 percent
from the field to hold off Davidson.
But Western’ s horrible free throw shoot-
ing down the stretch gave Davidson an
opportunity. The Catamounts led 75-
69 with 52 seconds to play, but only hit
5 of their last ten free throw attempts.

Their miscues and Davor
Halbauer’s three wizardry allowed the
Wildcats two opportunities to tie the
game in the final seconds. Down by
two, 79-77, Ali Ton drove the length of
the court for a lay-up on the righf side of
the hoop. The left-handed Ton missed,
forcing Halbauer to foul Casey Rogers.

Rogers made one free throw giv-
ing the trailing Wildcats one more shot
to force overtime. Ton took a three
point shot which fell short ending
Davidson’s season.

Junior Landry Kosmalski
struggled to give a reason for the sur-
prising end to the season.

Maybe we were a little surprised
and maybe a little tentative.”

Though he totaled but four points "

and a. lone rebound in the first half,
Kosmalski went on to lead Davidson
with 20 points and nine rebounds.

week in training and team leadership
roles. He has been elected by team-
mates as co-captain of the team for the
past two years, and swam a career best
time in the 400 individual medley less
than two weeks ago. He has also served
as vice president of the athletes’ execu-
tive committee of United States Swim-
ming, an organization which represents
more than 197,000 competitive swim-
mers from the novice to Olympic lev-
els. He has also served as editor of that
. Organization’s journal, “United States
Swimming Athletes’ Quarterly.”

His swim coach, Rich deSelm, de-
scribed Prince as a charismatic, out-
standing communicator who is very
devoted to what he chooses to do. “That
combination of characteristics makes
him extremely pleasant to work with,”
said deSelm. “He’s very well respected.”
Prince is majoring in English, with plans
to pursue a career in law “looking to-
ward civic leadership roles.” In other
words, he said, he could end up in
anything from politics to the non-profit
sector. “Wherever I’m most useful is
where I want to be,” he said.

A Solid Character

Professor Susan Roberts, who has
served as a mentor to Prince, described
him as humble and unassuming. She
also cited the creative way he has
blended his academic and extracurricu-
lar interests. She explained, “In my class
on ‘Parties and Interest Groups’ he chose
to study and write about an interest
group active with exceptional children,
which is a group he serves outside the
classroom. That’s the happiest combi-
nation of what we'd like to do at
Davidson, to inspire students to take
something in the academic arena and
use it for community service.”

Roberts was referring to Prince’s
role in founding the Davidson Special
Needs Mentoring Program, which pro-
vides mentally and physically handi-
capped students at North Mecklenburg
High and Mooresville-High with the
opportunity to socially interact with
Davidson students. He wrote about that
experience in an application essay for
the USA Today honor, describing his
efforts to involve 70 other students as
program volunteers, and talking about

his touching, personal relationship with
the individual student he serves.
Prince is fluent in Spanish and has
done volunteer work in Charlotte’ s His-
panic community. He has also written a
policy paper for a Davidson political
science class about the availability of
legal aid to illegal aliens, particularly in
Idaho. He showed that, though many of

_these aliens have the right to declare

legal residency, a particular clause in
the law prevents them from doing so.

A Bright Future

Though he’s quite honored to be
selected by USA Today, Prince isn’t
resting on his laurels. He still hopes to
obtain a further fellowship so he can
attend Cambridge or Oxford to pursue a
master’s degree in literature. But win or
lose, Prince is eager to continue his
studies. He concluded, “Maybe the
scholarships would help me clear the
hurdles ahead with a little more ease,
but not winning them won’t stop me
from clearing the hurdles. Scholarships
are perks, but not necessities.”
