THE DAVIDSONIAN

People should be allowed to
kill their own children, so long as
those children are infants. After
about age three, a child can reason-
ably be expected to think as a com-
plete person thinks. Before that
age, he is not a true person but only
a biological entity. Also, at that
age, the child has yet to develop
enough life experiences to make
him fear death, and those around
him will have very few memories of
him. Thus grief will be kept to a
minimum if he is killed.

I propose that infanticide be
legalized in the United States. I
support the establishment of cen-
ters which, at the demand of the
mother, will perform the infanti-
cides. Such centers should be rea-
sonably staffed by competent per-
sonnel who understand the advan-
tages of infanticide. To be well-
informed and competent, those who
would work in and use the centers
should understand a few points
about infanticide.

Infanticide is a viable option
for parents who, after the child has
lived a few months or years, deter-
mine that the child will be disad-
vantaged in life. Such parents in-
clude those from poor neighbor-
hoods, those who have participated
in incest, and those who would be
forced to give up education in order
to raise the child. With a painless
dose of a heavy drug, the child

Liberty shines where light has
arisen. ;

Davidson’s motto refers to the
meaning of education. Education
leads to truth, truth leads to enlight-
enment, and enlightenment leads
to rational understanding and free-
dom from the burdens of
misperception. Is that correct, or
does truth lead to a 3.8 which leads
to medical school which leads to a
six-digit salary?

Call me an idealist; you will be
speaking the truth. I have lofty
beliefs which will most likely be
exposed for the dreams that they
are once [receive my first poverty-
line paycheck. I hope, however,
that I still hold some of this ideal-

ism when I have children and en-
courage them toattend a liberal arts
school.

Many people spend their col-
lege careers studying and stress-
ing, complaining about workload
and canceling plans. They study
furiously in the library but rarely
take a break to give time in other
ways.

We are here to study, to learn,
and to make good grades. But our
specific education is liberal arts,
which means by definition that we
are here to learn in many different
capacities, and about many differ-
ent things. In order to receive a full
education, one must step out of the
bounds that are created by our syl-
labi and attempt to establish some

could be spared the burden of living
a disadvantaged life. Particular at-
tention would be paid to those teen-
age parents who realize, after a year
or two, that their child is a drain on
their social lives and income. Such
parents would be happy to learn that
the infanticide of one child would in
no way affect their ability to have
another. Imagine the sheer happi-
ness of these young people when
they realize that infanticide can work
for them! They
couldberid of the
child, with little
to rest on their

memories as an older child. Hence,
the loss of the child would not
psycho-logically scar his parents,
whereas the death of a three-year-
old would. One caneasily see, then,
how unobjectionable infanticide is.

Some might pose a legal argu-
ment to my proposal. Infanticide
might incorrectly be labeled mur-
derby those of the legal profession.
I will show how this is not so. Mur-

gross body reactions. Problem-solv-

children. To mislabel mere body
functioning as life takes away some-
thing that is uniquely human. One
could just as easily label a kitten as
a human life form! It breaths, cries,
eats, and makes waste. It cannot do
math or have feelings. Thus, it is
not human, and nei-
ther are infants.

fanticide centers after reaching age
three. Ethical reasons prevent the
consideration of older children for
the practice. A three-year-old, for
instance, has enough mental devel-
opment to be considered a “per-
son.” He has a memory and can
interact with those around him while
growing and adapting to his envi-
ronment. He can feel pain. Al-
though a two-year-old can also feel
pain, he often doesn’t understand
what causés it. Therefore, he is less
developed as a person than a three-
year-old. Furthermore, since an
infant would have lived for a short
time, the young child would not be
present in as many of his parents’

sort of an identity.

Some people at Davidson re-
sist this identity. They pick one that
they have seen before, for that is the
safest. They do what is expected of
them, but they rarely reach out be-
yond the parameters that parents or
friends or personal expectations
have set.

In the last three years, I have
witnessed a disturbing trend at
Davidson — people here are be-
coming less and less involved. In
many situations, I see talented
people giving up opportunities to
give Davidson a taste of our total
potential. -

Often involvement in an activ-
ity or organization at Davidson is a
sacrifice.

However, at Convocation
Wednesday several award winners
proved that in order to be involved
one does not have to make sacri-
fices. As awards were handed out,
Ilistened to the lists of accomplish-
ments read about each one. They
are athletes, scholars, presidents of
organizations, and people I see out
every weekend.

I admire these people greatly,
for they did not sacrifice but lived
up to their potential. We do not all
have it in us to give time to three or
four major activities, but we were
all admitted to this school for a
reason — because we are in some
way talented.

Upon graduation, we will all

termination of another’s life. One
must then define life to arrive at a
conclusion concerning murder.
Although its definition may be hard
to grasp, human life can be assumed
to mean coherent thought processes
coupled with feelings and problem-
solving skills. In this way, human
life is distinct from animal life, and
intentional ending of said human
life is murder. As we can plainly
see, infanticide is not equal to mur-
der. A two-year-old child’s thought
processes cannot be described as
coherent. Certainly, a wild waving
of arms and crying does not consti-
tute coherent thought! And, al-

have regrets. Many will wish that

they partied more, studied more, o:

made more friends. But most will
wish that they had done smalle

things — helped build a house for a
needy family, tutored a child who
could not afford to hire one, written
a creative piece for Hobart Park,
gone waterskiing at the lake cam-
pus, taken a piano class, seen more
theater productions, hung out at the
outpost coffeehouses, seen more
bands in the 900 Room, run the 5K,
or played aclub sport. Underclass-
men will have the same regrets as
they leave for the summer. Bu

most will leave Davidson this May
with little more than a beautiful set
of grades, drinking stories, or li-
brary memories.

Academics are our priority, tha
is obvious. But in order to get the
most out of them, we should look
beyond them and put them in per-
spective.

In failing to do so, one studies
with no idea of what they are study-
ing. Words and ideas are meaning-
less without a context in which to|
put them.

So as we all venture off into
the surreal sunset of post-Davidson,
we should hang a left (or right,
whatever you chose) off the caree
center superhighway, set our back-
packs aside, and and pick a daisy to|
smell. Too many may be noxious,
but life without them is boring and|
incomplete.

cal time-frame should be consid-

. ered, that a child should be legally

eligible until he can survive without
the aid of his mother. In that sce-
nario, a child’s life processes could
be legally terminated as late as six
years after his birth. A seven-year-
old child could, hypothetically, sur-
vive on his own at age seven. He
would be old enough to work and
could be taught to drive a car. Al-
though unlikely, the child could in-
deed make it on his own. The exact
legal age would be determined
through our court systems. My
guess is, though, that the legal cut-
off age would be around six years.

However logical the preceding

argument may seem, I simply can-
not bring myself to support it. For
my conscience to be clear, I must
know that the child has no coherent
thoughts or true feelings at the time
of his death. I find it difficult to
believe that a five-year-old child
could not solve problems, think
coherently, or have true feelings.
At that age, he could talk and other-
wise communicate with others.
Certainly, not only the biological
life of a potential person should be
a criterium for infanticide. For
moral purposes, thought processes
should also be considered. I find it
hard to believe anyone would ob-
ject to ending the “life” of one who -
is not truly human and cannot think
as acomplete human thinks. Those
children who can think and have
true feelings should be spared. .

Infanticide should be legalized
inthe United States. In determining
infant eligibility, biological subsis-
tence should not be the only crite-
rion. Those qualities which make
us uniquely human should be the
basis for any limit on age concern-
ing infanticide. Since human chil-
dren do not display human traits
until they reach about age three, all
children below three could be le-
gally terminated. A biological ar-
gument could be made allowing
five-year-olds to be killed. Human-
ity, though, would not stand for it.
Neither will I.

Year of SGA

I was elected in February as
President of the SGA, with some
big shoes to fill, and with my stance
being that I'd stand for all of you
with a smile. Appointments of the
committee and council chairs were
taken care of with success, and we
have chosen people with a lot of
motivation to better the school. We
administered the Priorities Poll to
rate studentissues, and the poll went
over pretty well. The results help
with the committees and councils,
and the Rides program (the
Vamonos Van) rolls on. We need
more volunteers to drive (gimme a
call), and we plan on making it a
major means of reliable transporta-
tion next year. Our Council on
Academic Affairs is working with
pass/fail dates, and we’ ll have class
evaluation booklets to help you with
course selection next year.

A Majors Fair was put on to
help those struggling over what
subject(s) to concentrate on, and
SGA Day, the Phonathon, and our
leadership retreat were all successes.
Chartering organizations was once
again controversial, but we pulled
through it pretty smoothly, keeping
the issues at hand. Some of the
things that we worked on, but
couldn’t change, were: reserved
books, smoking policies, and rec-
ognition of Veteran’s Day.

Some of you wanted us to look
into the prospect of having all course
books on reserve in the library, so
that you wouldn't have to pay 30
bucks for a book that you read 10
pages out of. This idea, although
really nice, is financially impos-
sible. The fact is that the bookstore
dogsnit gouge us swith their prices,

but that it’s the publishers who put
high price tags on their products.
We also looked into the prospect of
smoking in the 900 Room during 21
year-old night , and found that an
all-campus no smoking policy for
public buildings (except those where
the majority were in favor of smok-
ing, such as fraternity houses) was
passed by the administration a few
years ago. With the ventilation
system in the Union, even if you
smoked on the second floor in the
900 Room, the smoke would get
pumped to the floor. The hours of
Baker, particularly on the week-
ends, are being looked into next
year, as well as a kiosk for all-
campus communication. The rec-
ognition of Veteran’s Day did not
pass, but an official vote for ISA
did. I am personally looking into a
playground for the College, and toi-
let papet is brought up with our
committee with Residence Life.
So that’s the semester in re-

- view. It’s been good, but there is a

lot of room for improvement. I
invite you to get involved with the
SGA - run for an office or sign up
with a committee or come in for
interviews for positions. We’ve got
sign-ups for Faculty committees
right now, and will be talking to-
morrow about the ATC allocations.
If you represent a body that asked
the ATC for money, want to hear
and be heard, or find out what’s
going on, please come at 9 p.m. to
the Conference Room. Also, [know
that I run around a lot, but I will
always make time to listen, so pull
me aside. I hope this has made you
more aware of what we do, and how
wecanhelp you.) + -
