FRIDAY, MARCH 13, 1953

On the rare occa-
sions when a Davidson
team wins a trophy for
some outstanding ac-
complish ment, the
hardware which does
not become the per-
manent property of
the winners is custo-
marily stashed away in
the trophy cases in the
f lobby of Johnston
Gymnasium. But the
newest addition to the
Davidson collection is
* not to be found within
the confines of the
Gym. The present lo-
cation of this gold-plated tribute to Davidson athletic prowess
is on a shelf behind the counter of the Broken Anchor Cafe,
which is just about two good stones’ throws away from the
D. C. campus.

it was due in large part to the generosity of Anchor
proprietor Bryant “Sig” Sigmon that Arnold Whisnant’s Card-
board Village boys came off with the championship in the
recent Morganton, N. C. semi-pro basketball tournament. Sig
was good enough to pay the Broken Anchor brigade's ex-
penses for four round trips to Morganton, and he had the
added gratification of seeing his club do better than any
team of Davidsonians has done in a while: Come off with an
undefeated record.

Captain-Manager Whisnant (the Anchor team was a sort
of loose organization and wouldn’t say who was the head man,
but Whiz seems to be the big organizer), one of the elite over
in the Village, is a Morganton native, and when he heard of
the tournament sponsored by the City Recreation organization,
it seemed like a good chance to win some publicity for the
plutocrats of the campus (four rooms to every apartment). So
Whiz lined up the formidable combination of George King,
Adrian Bowen, Lindley Beardsley, Jimmy Smith, Don Menzies,
Moose Lazenby, and a few others, and was off to the races
some two and a half weeks ago.

Right away the Anchor team went to work in a winning
style. They polished off the dormitory team from Fritz Hall
of Lenoir-Rhyne in their first night of play by a 64-52 count,
with Jimmy coming through for a 20-point total.

Smith eased up to 21 points in the Anchor quintet’s sec-
ond appearance on the Morganton High School hardwood, as
they disposed of Shelby Mills 65-52. Don Lazenby put 16 in
the basket that night.

As they went into the stretch, proprietor Sigmon’s team
found themselves paired with the State Hospital of Morgan-
ton, and did away with this crowd fairly easily, winning 64-50.
Lazenby came through with 16 again that night.

For March 20 Opener

By MOODY SMITH

Tennis Coach Dick McKee

has been hampered during the

past two weeks in holding practice sessions by the current in-
clement weather, but has nevertheless had his squad working
daily in the gym to get in shape.

So far McKee does not know
what his starting lineup will be,
but a safe bet would be that the
six singles matches will see Lacy
Keesler, Johnny Bremer, Joe Dud-
ley, George Snead, Corky Clark,
and Leighton Green in action.

Keesler, Bremer, Dudley, and
Clark were regulars in singles play
last season, while Snead played
regularly in doubles only. Leighton
Green showed flashes of his real
ability on occasions, but was used
only as a substitute in both singles
and doubles matches. Much of the
success or failure of the team this
year, however, may depend on
whether the scholarly Texan can
hit his stride.

Opener Next Week

The team plunges into its 1953
schedule next week as they begin
a week-long, five-match swing
through Alabama, Florida and
Georgia.

The netmen will then return
home for a five match home stand
from March 30 through April 5.

The slate for the busy first two
weeks of the season runs as fol-
lows:

Starting on Friday, March 20,
Davidson plays Jacksonville State
Teachers College at Jacksonville
Alabama. Saturday the Cats tangle

Hengeveld Playing
With Service Team
‘In Far East Theatre

Lt. “Dutch” Hengeveld, class of
‘61, who was a set shot artist on
Davidson's 1950-51 basketball
team, is still engaging actively
in the hoop sport with a service
team in Japan. His team won the
championship in divisional and
regional play, then went on to take
top honors in the Central Tourna-
ment at Tokyo.

If his team can go all the way in
the Far East league, Dutch’s team
will be sent Statewide to Ft.
Meade, Maryland to play for the

; |all-service championship early in

April.
Dutch writes his father, College

= | Registrar F. W. Hengeveld, that

he is averaging about 20 points
per game, and that in his league a
man plays the whole game until

._ the is “fouled out or knocked out.”

If Hengeveld is sent back to this
country for tournament play he
would probably not return to Japan
but be assigned to a unit in this
country until his discharge time

comes up in July.

Golfers Working
Hard For Opener
On Holiday Jaunt

By FLOYD FRENEY

The Davidson golf team begins
its season with a two stop South-
ern tour. March 21 finds the Cat
golfers teeing off against an ex-
tremely strong Rollins team on the
Floridians home course. The link-
sters complete their swing south
with a match on March 23 at Flor-
ida State.

Bad weather has hampered the
linksters from rounding into top
form. At present the race is still
wide open for first line positions.
Coach Elgin White will probably
choose his lineup from such sea-
soned performers as Captain kew
Barnes, Graeme Keith, Tom Abel,
and Lawrence Erwin, and new-
comers Joe Jenkins, Mickey Can-
non, Ed and Tommy Douglass,
Hobby Cobb, Alex Hodgin, and
Larry Parrott.

The complete schedule is as fol-
lows:

March 21 — Rollins.

March 23 — Florida State.

March 27 — Furman (home).

March 28 — Duke (home).

April 1 — Ohio University

(home).

April 4 — Florida (home).

April 6 — Clemson.

April 7 — Wofford.

April 13 — Furman.

Michigan State Tough

Monday, March 31, the Michigan
State College team arrives here
for the opening match on the home
courts. Last year the Michigan
Staters were one of the four teams
to beat Davidson during the regu-
lar season, the others being Duke,
Princeton and Harvard, after the
latter had been defeated by the
Cats twice early in the season.

Harvard’s tennis squad will ar-
rive in town for two matches on
the following Wednesday and
Thursday. Friday and Saturday
will s¢ée Davidson playing Sewanee
and Dartmouth respectively.

Of the eight teams Davidson
will face in this two week period,

all except Michigan State and Har. | :

vard are new to the schedule this
year, and more or less unknown
quantities. At. present the Mich.
igan boys and the Crimsons ap-
pear to be the toughest of the op-
position.

Continued rains and cold t.
ther have combined to postpone
the interfraternity track meet still
another week. Dates for the track
event have now been moved up to
Monday and Tuesday of next week,
interfraternity sports director
Pete Whittle said yesterday.

The wet weather has also forced
the postponement of the Red-Black
football game which Coach Bill
Dole was planning to end the sea-
son with this Saturday afternoon.
Now it appears the game will be
played Monday or Tuesday of next
week.

And, as if this were not enough,
the current monsoon season has
laid Coach Dole up in bed with
a case of flu. If he doesn’t recover
sufficiently by next week, the clos-
ing practices of winter football
may have to go on without him.

Along the interfraternity line,
Coach Whittle has announced that
the volleyball season will begin
soon after school opens again after
spring holidays. Several teams
have already begun practice for

KAs Place Two On All-Star
Fraternity Basketball Team

The league-champion KAs placed
two men on the first string of the
1953 all-interfraternity basketball
team picked by the players this
week to dominate that mythical
quintet. Another man placed on
the second team to make it three
out of ten for the KAs.

Adrian Bowen received 31 votes
in the balloting, and thus doubles
as captain of the all-fraternity
five. The ATOs Linny ‘Baker and
the Phi Delts’ Ted Oldenburg re-
ceived 30 apiece, and the KAs’
George King was close behind
with. 28. Tom Shaw of Sigma Chi
made the first five with 24 votes.

was next in the balloting, placing
him first on the second team. Oth-
ers on the second squad were Bill
Bivins, Phi Delt; Lindley Beard-
sley, Pika; Tyler Berry, Sigma
Chi; and Harry Peterson, SAE.

Receiving the Honorable Men-
tion notice were Larry Champion,
Phi Gam; Charlie Hasty, Betas;
George Lippard, Kappa Sig; Tim
Gilley, ATO; Fred Stowe, SPE;
and Clark Reed of the Campus
Club.

The election of the team is han-
dled through the several interfra-
ternity sports managers and Coach
Pete Whittle, supervisor of the
interfraternity sports program.

Davidson will be represented
in the meet by fourteen com-
petitors in six weights. The ve
ber of local entries has dwin
from twenty-three who had nein
ally planned to enter competition
as flu and studies take there toll.

Prominent among the list of
those who will be unable to com-
pete is Johnny Buxton who is in
bed with the flu. Johnny took
third place in his 147 Ib. class last
in the Southern Conference meet
at VMI. Buxton won 2 — lost 1
in copping his conference third
as-he was defeated by the defend-
ing champion in his first match.

Craven At 136 Lbs.

The top prospect from the David-
son entrants will be as usual Cap-
tain Gene Craven at 136 lbs. Gene
made ‘a fine showing last week up
at VMI where he won three and
lost only one to take third in the
conference in his weight.

This will be Craven's last ap-
pearance as a Davidson grappler
and his presence will be sorely
missed next season. Gene has been
an outstanding wrestler in all com-
petition in his college career with
a second fast year) and a third
in conference title matches.

Davidson Athletic Director Paul
K. Scott revealed that there was
a good group of entrants and that
the matches should be better than
fast year’s event. Several of the
high schools of the vicinity have
submitted entries as have several
YMCA’s and independents. The
weight classes range from the 114
Ib. group up to the heavyweights.

Bill Weick, former NCAA and
National AAU champion in the
157 lb. class, will show his talents
again this year. He will be work-
ing in the 160 Ib. class in this
match. When Weick Won these na-
tional honors he was _ represent-
ing Iowa State Teacher’s College,
but he comes with the Army grap-
plers this year.

Stiff Competition

Weick will meet some stiff com-
petition in the person of Steve
Gabriel, former Appalachian State
Teacher's star. Gabriel won the
160 Ib. class last year in this
tournament and is a strong con-
tender to repeat this honor.

WHITTLE, FULCHER
AUTHOR CHANGES IN
SPORTS FRAT RULES

Davidson's track coach, A.
Heath “Pete” Whittle, has com-
bined brain power with Professor
H. E. Fulcher of the College phy-
sics department, and the net re-
sults of these men and their ideas
changed the rules requirements
for the high jump tests for mem-
‘bership in the National Sigma
Delta Psi Athletic Fraternity.

Whittle and Fulcher came up
with the idea that the high jump
test for membership in this na-
tional fraternity should be judged
according to height and weight,
and after submitting this proposal
to the National Fraternity Secre-
tary, Dave Matthews of Bowling
Green University, it was voted up-
on and adopted.

Whittle’s New Scale

The scale runs from a height of
43" to that of 6'3", with weight
also becoming a determining fac-
tor on how high a man should be
able to jump in order to pass the
test. A man 6'3” tall and weighing
160 pounds has a test level of five
feet, three inches to jump, while
a man weighing 190 or over in the
same height bracket would only
have to jump five feet.

This new scale submitted by
Coach Whittle has been highly
praised by the National organiza-
tion of Sigma Delta Psi, and the
secretary ordered all local chap-
ters to put the new scale into use
at once.

The adoption of this new scale
of height and weight is a high
honor for Whittle, who says that
such a scale could not have been
worked out without the great help
given by Professor Fulcher.

Coach Whittle is the only mem-
ber of Sigma Delta Psi on the
Davidson faculty or coaching staff.
Undergraduate members are A. C.
Gregg, Don Lazenby, Gene Pierce,
and Bill Shipley.
