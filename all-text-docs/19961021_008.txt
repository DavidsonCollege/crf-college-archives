Tupac Shakur: A Baptism and Trial by Fire

Darkness. An evolving, ever-
changing void which stretches
through the vast, nebulous con-
fines of space. From this abyss, the
four natural elements came forth.
Namely, earth, wind, water and
fire. However, as time went on, the
first three elements dissipated into
oblivion and the element known as
fire remained. Fire. What is fire?
All of a sudden, it came to me like
a blinding light, a flash of insight.
Fire is the conviction to maintain
and persevere when they call you
- whatever they’re going to call you.

The former sentiment exem-
plifies the late rapper/actor Tupac
Shakur. For during his 25 turbu-
lent years of life on this planet,
Tupac Shakur was persecuted by a
wave of controversy which would
follow him continuously for the
duration of his life. However, for
all of the drama which surrounded
Tupac, one cannot deny that the
man was honest and truthful about
the reality of the life experiences
and expectancies of inhabitant’ s in
America’s inner cities. In doing
so, he always stayed true to him-
self and his mission of producing
music regardless of the of the rep-
rimands, jibes and insults he re-
ceived from the naysayers and his
critics. He was America’s prime
agent provocateur. And that is a
nice term, considering that he was
portrayed as a thug, an opportunist
and a media manipulator by the
press. For all the criticism Tupac
received, he still called things as he
saw them. The man never pulled
any punches. No retreat and no
surrender. Tupac was a man who
answered to no one but himself
and was not above responding to
his critics about when they ques-

tioned his opinions. I respect this
and I respect him for his solid take
onthe sensitive subjects that people
often consider taboo.

One should not be surprised
about his take on life. Sometimes,
people may see evidence of certain
goings-on and tend to sweep is-

descent. His life seemed to mirror
his craft or vice versa. There were
constant media coverage, brushes
with the judicial system and ru-
mors of bad blood between com-
peting rap recording firms from
the East and West coasts. But that
was all it was. It was bad press

the power came from the fact that
many of these same people identi-
fied personally with his music. He
unwittingly became a public fig-
ure to whom many a person could
relate, since their daily struggles
were finally being adressed by one
of their peers.

world may have been a dark jail
cell where his mother (a member
of the activist Black Panthers) car-
ried him while being incarcerated
for taking part in a protest in the
early 1970s. I believe this first
foray into real life, may have in-
nately set the stage-for the trou-
bling times that were yet to come.

Maybe he was becoming
aware of his situation in society at
large, for the lyrics in his albums
touched on the harshness of life in
poverty-stricken areas. As time
progressed, his lyrics became more
brash about issues such as black
male genocide, politicians’ insen-
sitive views towards the hip-hop
culture, harassment by the police
and the numerous other plagues
that haunt Americans of African

from an overzealous media whose
sole objective was to obtain good
ratings and sell newspapers. Tupac
took his time.in the spotlight with
a grain of salt, but not without
responding to those people who
sought to debase his character. The
model, Tyson Beckford summed it
up in arecent VIBE article,” There
is something seemingly threaten-
ing about black men . . . once you
get to acertain level, [ people] start
messing with you.”

It must be said that Tupac
Shakur was not a saint. Yet, de-
spite his difficulties, he had raw
talent and potential. He never as-
sumed that he was a spokesman
for the younger members of an
ignored subculture of minorities.

ahs sane 8 The fire was with him from the tty
revolutionary multimil-
group in Fern), time he was born. Hon eau
his first sub- ing tracks
conscious and _al-
glimpse of the bums, was

himself dropped on Sept 13, 1996.
A few days later, Tupac gave up
the ghost and died of heart failure,
after struggling to return to the
land of the living. Comments came
in fast and furious. Words express-
ing pain and sorrow to others who
simply professed nonchalance.
Many of us have seen the negative
side of Tupac, but he did have a
sensitive side. Too many times we
tend to focus on the evil. His re-
flective side is present in his lyrics.
“Dear Mama” is his most intro-
spective piece. In this song, he
pays homage to his mother and is
thankful for the time and responsi-
bility she spent caring for him and
his sister. The lyrics follow:
Mama I finally understand/
for a woman it [ain’t] easy trying

to raise a man/ you [ always were
committed ]/A poor single mother
on welfare/ Tell me how you did it
/ There is no way I can pay you
back/ But the plan is to show you
that I understand./ You are appre-
ciated. “Dear Mama”

Then there is the sorrow he
expresses for a young mother who
is trapped by her circumstances:

Now Brenda never really
knew her mom/and her dad was a
junkie putting death into his arms/
It’s sad because I bet Brendadidn’t
know/Just [cuz] you’re in the
ghetto/ doesn’t mean you can’t
grow.” “Brenda’s got a baby”

These next few lyrics ex-
presses a lament for his male coun-
terparts who died in violent cir-
cumstances:

How many brothers fell vic-
tim to the streets / rest in piece
young [brothers]/Is there aheaven
for a G?/Be a lie if I told you that
I never thought of death/ My
[brother], we’[re] the last one’s
left/ And life goes on. “Life goes
on”

And life does go on. A few
days after his death, he was cre-
mated. The man, who constantly
lived within the fire and fanned the
flames of controversy, was finally
consumed by the element which
spawned him, But the fire has not |
been extinguished. Somewhere
out there, a flame is being lit in his .
memory.

Hopefully, some of us will
learn from his death. In the mean-
time, for those people who are con-
stantly under fire, always remem-
ber: fire is the conviction to perse-
vere and excel when the nay-say-
ers call you whatever they’re go-

I have watched the recent de-
bate between Sabine Heller and
Saad Gul, Fahd Gul, Yasar Ishaq
and Vinod Thomas with great:in-
terest. For me, it is a situation in-
volving many variables. I am a
feminist and a Middle Eastern Stud-
ies major.

For a long time, I played the
apologist and denied women’s re-
alities in the Middle East because I
was anxious to dispel Western ste-
reotypes about the region. (Oh, if
you are antsy about the placement
of Pakistan within the geographi-
cal category of the Middle East, I
am doing so for my own purposes
in this article. I understand that all
may not agree with this and I un-
derstand why.)

At first, I was a bit surprised
that nobody wrote in to defend
Sabine Heller. But it really isn’t
surprising when I think about it. In
effect, if) you defend Ms. Heller,
then you defend western feminism.
If you defend western feminism,

another region. If you defame cul-
tuté,

believe this? I don’t. Defending
Ms. Heller is easy. Her point was
simple: women face subjugation in
most of the world; we should be
mindful of this oppression.

If you would like to know
what feminists in Pakistan struggle
against, you don’t have to go there.
Look no further than Fahd Gul and
Yasar Ishaq. Their description of
the “respect” given to women in
Pakistan is as follows: “Public
transportation has seats reserved in
the front for women. . .having trav-
elled extensively around Pakistan,
we can recall. . . having to step off
the bus because there was not
enough space for the women.” Is
this equality? Is this respect? No.
This is a policy based on an
androcentric notion of man’s
strength and woman’s weakness.

I would never claim that sex-
ism does not exist in the modern
industrial West. I understand that
the Mssrs. Gul, Mr. Ishaq, and Mr.
Thomas feel the need to increase
awareness of their respective coun-

rant. ¢

In John Blake’s Defense

Iam writing in regard to the
Union Board’s recent cancellation
of the mock game show “Singled
Out” on DCTV. Once again, we
have managed to let political cor-
rectness get the best of us. The
decision was just plain silly for a
number of reasons.

First let me say that I don’t
care if the show is run or not. It’s
not a big deal. However, on prin-
ciple, I think we are embarrassing
ourselves by suggesting that we
don’ thave enough decency tohave
good, clean fun.

This is a good example of a
common Davidson fallacy. . .think-
ing too much and intellectualizing
an innotent social event so that all
common sense in the matter is lost.
Abraham Lincoln once said, “If
you look only for the evil in man,
you shall surely find it.” This ob-
servation applies to our situation.
It is certainly good to be sensitive

. » to the feelings. of others, but there
:is a distinct: difference between -

hate to say that, but I can’t help but
think it regarding this issue, and a
lot of others on campus. It seems
like over-intellectualizing and po-
litical correctness cloud our com-
mon sense.

Nothing is more representa-
tive of Davidson than our Honor
Code. In order to gain certain free-
doms, we must have a general trust
in each other based on an optimis-
tic view of human nature. This
works because intelligent and ethi-
cal people respond well to free-
dom and generally live up to what
is expected of them. If we expect
that we can’t control ourselves,
what are we saying?

Let me address the opinion
that “Well, there’s always one that
will get out of control and do some-

thing stupid to embarrass them- —

selves.” I like to call this the “Vil-
lage Idiot” hypothesis. There’s one
idiot everywhere you go, and ev-
eryone has been that idiot at some
point in theirlives. You eithershrug

self, or let acute tension progress to
neuroticism, schizophrenia, and
eventual homicidal behavior. I’m
only kidding (It’s important to point
this out, since the people I’m speak-
ing to may not get the joke, other-
wise).

I must also question the “little
less than half of the Union Board”
who abstained from voting. Why
are you on the Union Board, to
begin with?

This is not at all meant to shun
the Union Board. Many factors
play into such decisions, and since
I haven’t the foggiest about the
background of this argument, I
must give them the benefit of the
doubt. I must say, however, that it
will be a very pathetic day in
Davidson history when we can’t
hold amock game show with some
degree of decorum.

Why can’t we laugh at our-
selves?

Am wrong to have such con-
fidence j in Davidson students? ay
