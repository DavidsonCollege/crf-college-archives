Nomad's
Horoscopes

If today is your birthday, then
you'll probably tell everyone
anyway, just so you can get some
groundless attention on the first
day of school, you little dork.
Happy Birthday, you're thatmuch
closer to death.

LEO: Your pathetic existence
takes a turn for the worse. The
acne on your back grows into
several swollen boils that no li-
censed dermatologist will even
consider lancing.

VIRGO: While Jenine suggests
that since Virgo is one: of the
most highly intelligent signs of
the zodiac, you should pull
through with much aplomb, she's
wrong. If you're a freshman guy
lucky enough to be born under
this lovely sign, it will remain
applicable until the senior women
start to get desperate.

LIBRA: Your constant search
for balance winds up fruitless
this week. Geta life, and give up
on this quest for astrological equi-
librium.

SCORPIO: "Come armaged-
don,come." "Me withoutclothes,
well, a nation turns its back and
gags." Don't eat your friends on
Sundays in November.

SAGITARIUS: What the hell is
the deal with that half man-half
beast sign thing you people have?
The stars suggest that it repre-
sents the bestial nature of hu-

manity, buthey everybody sucks,

735

—'so don't go’ thinking that you're

something especially rotten,

ANSWERS

CAPRICORN: Remeber
Bowser from the hit series Sha-
Na- Na? Rumour has it that he's
been seen zipping his fly while
leaving your house.

AQUARIUS: You shall spend
first night back surrounded by
desperate and pathetic members
oftheclass of 91 who can'thandle
life away from Davidson, and
wind up hooking with sopho-
mores.

PISCES: Cookoocachoo, I am
the walrus.

ARIES: Michael Landon's death
has left an inestimable void in
your already worthless existence.
Just remember, even though
Charles Ingalls was a pretty nice

in the Morrison
Room.

dad, Willie and Nellie Olson had
the rich parents, and all the cool
stuff.

TAURUS: "The flowers came
back, and I hushed."

GEMINI: Years from now, your
best friend from youth shallreach
high office, and when you wave
him down inacrowdhe will look
right at at you and quote a king:
"I know thee not, old man."
