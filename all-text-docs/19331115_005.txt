Ha CASKIE NOQVELL 22

Praise his name! And any other
expression that you wish to throw in,
because Johnny Mackorell, shifty Da-
vidson field general, virtually assured
himself of a berth on the all-state team
by his scintillating play in Davidson’s
26-6 licking of the Citadel eleven.

Displaying offensive pyrotechnics,
the like of which have been seldom
seen on staid Richardson Field, the
Wildcats shellacked their Bulldog foes
soundly, in the annual classic between
the two teams. It was their thirteenth
meeting, and the ’Cats really put it to
’em, and got a sugar-coated revenge
for Citadel's 7-6 victory of last season.

To give away orchids this week
would undoubtedly break the old boy,
but special mention should be given
some Davidson players, and also some
Citadel performers, who really put that
game on the map as a classic among
classics. There was “Little Joe” Wing-
field, the dapper young halfback who
was everywhere at once, and nowhere
at all when the Bulldogs went to nab
him. Let us not forget Dewey Hutch-
ins, and his two runs to touchdown;
Big Jim Morgan, potential all-state
candidate, who nabbed one of Mack-
orell’s accurate tosses for a 21-yard
gain, and Baxter Yarborough, who
showed up well in his first appearance
on a college gridiron.

In the line we had the brilliant play
of Captain Rives, McElrath, Potter,
Windham, and Siewers. The whole
team did its bit in a fine exhibition of
blocking, when Mackorell two-stepped
his way to a 74-yard touchdown run,
The work of Ogilvie in the Citadel
line is decidedly worthy of mention,
and the pile-driving tactics of Fergu-
son and Quarterman was good foot-
ball in the best leagues.

The long-awaited. punting duel be-
tween Mackorell and Quarterman
turned out to be a honey. The South
Carolinian, declared by many to be
the nation’s greatest punter, got off
several beautiful kicks, but one boot
that was blocked placed his average
below that of Mackorell, as the local
field general was consistently booting
those good old _ forty-five-yarders,
which are the safe and sane method
of picking up yardage.

With the Citadel game, as we have
mentioned before, Mackorell is being
played up for all-state honors. The
press picks Hendrickson as possibly
the outstanding quarterback of the
Southern Conference. And if the all-
-southern elevens were picked on a
basis of all teams within that area,

and not just conference teams, the
name of Mackorell would head the
list for the quarterback post. Give
me the Duke line, and a_ backfield

composed of Mackorell, South Caro-
lina’s Earl Clary, Citadel’s Quarter-
man, and. Washington and Lee’s Saw-
yers, and it would be just too bad for
Southern California, Purdue, and the
other big boys.

Well, so much for Wingfield, Hutch-
ins, and Mackorell, Inc.’s, nice lacing
of the Citadel. And now let us turn
to the freshman team, who turned in a
smooth piece of work when. they
turned back the Wofford freshmen,
32-0, in a game played last Friday on
Richardson Field. Coaches Laird and
Peabody put their entire squad on the
field, and when Peabody, the younger,
made two touchdowns, Wofford was
a goner, and Garrison, Corbin, Quick,
Shemwell, and Cook simply tore the
Terrier line to shreds to score at will.

Next week the Davidson Wildcats
go up against the William and Mary
Indians at Williamsburg, Va., for the
first meeting of the teams in some
years. Both schools have good teams
this year, and a keen contest should
result. This column chooses Davidson,
as we propose to show you below.

V. M. I. beat Virginia 13-12, and
Virginia licked Randolph-Macon, 32-0.
Then William and Mary beat Ran-
dolph-Macon, 12-0. Therefore Virginia
is 20 points better than William and
Mary, and V. M. I. is 21 points the
superior, Davidson is then 27 points
better than William and Mary as the
locals thrashed V. M. I., 6-0. On the

Class Quints Begin
Annual Tournament

The annual basketball tournament
between the four classes of Davidson
College was begun on Monday, No-
vember 16. The class winning this
tournament has a goodly number of
points added to their total. The class
having the largest number of points at
the close of the year will receive a
reward,

The tournament inaugurated itself
with the Seniors engaging the Fresh-
men. The schedule is so arranged that
each team will have two games with
every other team on the Hill.

The coaches for each team are:
Seniors, Fred Smyre; Juniors, Court-
ney Ross; Sophomores, Mack Holland;
Freshmen, John Lafferty.

All games will be played, it is hoped,
before the first regular varsity sched-
uled game.

In the opening game, the Freshmen,
led by Knorr and Gaw, knocked off
the Seniors, 24-22.

a close victory over the Wildcats,
27 to 29. :

Although Davidson's sensational

sophomore runner, Earle Frazier, led
the pack in the fair time of 16 minutes,
38 seconds, and was followed closely
by Ellis Oakes, the power of the Tar

Heel boys was shown when they
placed the next four men to gain a
lead in the seoring which could not

be overcome.

The harriers were greatly hindered
in the running of the course by the
soggy condition of the ground, caused
by a hard shower shortly before the
meet, A slight rain was falling during

the seeming slowness of the running
time.

This is the first defeat of the season
for the Davidson team, since they tied
Duke, 28 to 28; won over N. C. State,
19 to 39, and decisively defeated Wash-
ington and Lee, 20 to 43.

The order in which the runners fin-
ished, with the points scored by each,
is as follows: Frazier (Davidson), 1;
Oakes (Davidson), 2; Williamson (Car-
olina), 3; Curlee (Carolina), 4; Sul-
livan (Carolina), 5; Sullivan (Carolina),

Next) week-end the
is slated to go north up to Charlottes-
ville, where they will meet the Uni-
versity of Virginia harriers. The Cav-
aliers have run thus far the Navy
cross-country team, which beat them
by a good margin, and, in a triangle
meet, V. M. I. and W. & L., both of
these teams showing up as stronger
than the Virginia boys.

FIRST ’KITTEN WIN

Wofford Fresh Threaten Only
Once

Held scoreless in the first half, Da-
vidson freshmen broke loose in the
second period to defeat the Wofford
yearlings, 32-0. Davidson had a de-
cided edge the first half, outplaying
Wofford in every department in the
game, but seemed to lack the necessary
punch to pass the 15-yard line.

The only scoring threat offered by
Wofford came when, after a kick to
the ‘Kittens’ 43-yard line, a pass was
intercepted by the Terriers and the
ball placed on Davidson's 18-yard line
However, this threat was stopped
when Cook intercepted one of the Ter-

riers’ passes to give the Davidson
freshmen the ball on their own 25-
yard line. The next play, which
caused much excitement in the Da-

vidson stands, had Gracey, the center,
passing the ball to the quarterback,
who returned it to Gracey to send
him on a 65-yard gallop to Wofford’s
30-yard line, After four tries at the
line the ball went over to Wofford on
her own 25-yard line. The half ended,
when after a series of kicks Davidson
had the ball in mid-field.
