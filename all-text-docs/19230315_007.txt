REV. DR. DUNCAN THOMAS ’06
ACCEPTS A CALL TO A
LARGER FIELD.

Word has come to Davidson that
one of her alumni has been the re-
cipient of a decided honor by being
called to the pastorate of Braden-
town, Florida, from his temporary
position at Fitzgerald, Ga. This
is Rev. Dr. Duncan Thomas, whose
name will strike a chord of pleas-
ant memories in the minds of some
of our old students. He preached
his first sermon in the new place
during the early part of February,
and his hearers were so struck by
his display of intellect, his spirit,
and pleasing personality that they
hesitated not one moment in send-
ing him the call which resulted in
bringing him to Bradentown.

The college is always glad to
hear of what her off-spring are
doing. She is watching with deep-
felt interest each one as he goes
through his life and any item of his
activities is always received and
read with enthusiasm.

Throughout the years there has
gone out from Davidson a constant
stream of young men eager to
work with and for their fellow-
men. They have been called into
professions, without number, not
the least of which is the preaching
and teaching of God’s word.

In the fall of 1906 there came to
this institution a young man, Mr.
Duncan Thomas, from his native
haunts of Virginia. Hecame from
a family well-known in the world
of Christianity, and he had before
him a line of ancestry who were
all workers of God.

Arriving at Davidson, Mr.
Thomas immediately became ac-
tively engaged in college life and
activities. Asa star on the varsity
squad he took part in the decisive
defeats of the University of Geor-
gia, Georgia Tech, N. C. A. & M.,
V. M.I., Auburn, Annapolis and all
the other old-time rivals of the
Red and Black.

During the spring of 1909 and
1910, Duncan occupied a very im-
portant position on the track team.
He ran the middle distances for the
college and during the meets of
1909 set an All-South record in
both the ‘quarter and half-mile
runs. This superior ability of Mr.
Thomas’ seemed to transmit itself
to his team-mates and it was the
chief causes of Davidson’s high
stand in those days.

He also helped in putting out one
of Davidson’s best college an-
nuals at the close of his Senior
year when he was business mana-
ger and editor-in-chief.

After finishing Davidson, Mr.
Thomas went to Union Seminary
from whence he graduated in 1915.
From then on his work among the
churches has been worthy of con-
siderable note, but it is only now
that he is receiving his real due.
He has accepted the call of the
Presbyterian church of Braden-
town, a field where we are sure the
abilities of the new pastor may be
manifested. The Presbyterians of
this town are to be heartily con-
gratulated on securing the services
of one so highly gifted as Dr.
Thomas. With the best of wishes
from his host of friends and the
blessing of his alma mater, he took
charge of his new church on March
4th.

March 12th, 1923.
Editor-in-Chief,
The Davidsonian,
Davidson, N. C.
Dear Sir:

Have just finished reading the
last issue of The Davidsonian and
thought I would tell you just what
I think of it.

Of course, being an old Davidson
man, anything pertaining to the
college is of interest, but leaving
out that connection, I think it is the
best gotten up weekly I have ever
seen. The contents are well edited,
cleverly written, and diversified to
make it complete. It is the one
medium to keep the Alumni in
touch with the active happenings
of the college, and I have heard
many Of them voice the same opin-
ion as to how well pleased they
were with it.

Back in the good old days of
1915 when the paper was organized
it met with much opposition, and it
is indeed gratifying to see how
successfully it has turned out.

With best wishes for continued
success, I am,

Yours very truly,
JAS. H. CARSON, ’16.
SENIORS HOLD SMOKER
AND MAKE MANY PLANS

The Seniors are getting gay in
their old age! In other words, as
time rolls by and graduation draws:
near, the more elderly members of
the student body, those who wear
the derby and sport the cane, are
planning big things for their re-
maining existence as honored Sen-
iors and their longer existence as
alumni,

At the Senfor Smoker held last
Saturday night after the movies,
the class attended to important
business and discussed the idea of
appointing a secretary for the class
to hold office after his college days
are over. Each member of the
present Senior class will be expect-
ed to write the secretary a letter
discussing plans for advancement
of the Alma Mater. The secretary

will in turn send copies of each
letter to the members of the class.
In this way. the class expects to re-
main organized and acting.

Plans for a Senior farewell ban-
quet at Myer’s Park Country ‘Club
were also discussed. If present
plans are carried out, the Seniors
will rate ace high with their full
dress and one “Fire” apiece.

Leonard Dick made a report for
the Court of Control in regard to
its activities. He said that every
man who had been before this
board had spoken his approval of it
and expressed the opinion that he
has been helped by it.

The Seniors fhen elected the fol-
lowing officers : H. K. Russell, Class
Poet; W. J. Cooper, Hitsorian; Joe
Baldwin, Commencement Orator;
and R. L. McLeod, Dispenser of
Class Gifts.

The Seniors are planning a big
rush as a fitting climax to cap their

four years of eventful life,
TD.

THE FORWARD LOOK

Last Monday morning saw the first
of the student body elections for the
coming year. Other elections will fol-
low before long. ‘The election for
student body president will come soon,
A writer in the Forum recently urged
that we consider carefully the qualifi-
cations of all nominees for the par-
ticular .office for which they are sug-
gested. It is hoped that the Fresh-
men will pay particular attention to
this, and that the upperclassmen be
careful too, Popular men will prob-
ably be offered, and of course pop-
ularity is one desirable qualification,
but popularity alone won’t enable 1
man to lead our student body or our
Y.M. C. A.

Fellows, let’s be careful and not
let our feelings run away with our
reason, ‘The men chosen for these
officers will determine largely how
things will run here next year. Only
men of real high ideals and courage
in standing up for them are worthy
of our votes.

Vote, and think clearly before you
vote. The Junior Class has sufficient
good men. Let's not pass the best
ones by for weaker ones.

CANDIDATES STAGE BATTLE
(Continued from Page 1)

There seems to be no reason why
the Wildcats should lack for pitchers
this year. Besides the three letter
men who can toss a mean pill, Potts,
McLaughlin, and Bub Johnson are
showing up well on the mound. ‘These
Freshmen all carry good records from
prep school and with a year or so of
training ought to furnish ample ma-
terial for the Red and Black hurling
staff.

Behind the bat Brice, Black, and
McDonald are running a close race.
Here again, a couple of first year
men are pushing a wearer of the “D”
for a place on the battery.

In the infield only one man has
returned from the ’22  team—Pat
Crawford, captain for the season.
Pat never misses one at first base,
so that post is well taken care of,
Kugler and Smith are other promis-
ing candidates for a place at the first
corner of the diamond.

Second base probably will be in
charge of McCoy, Robins, or Bach-
mann, all of whom are doing well.

A berth at short-stop is being hotly
contested between Simpson, another
man of some experience, and Sappen-
field, fast little quarterback on the
Freshman eleven last Fall.

Covington and Long are the most
outstanding figures around the third
sack. ‘Ted showed some real form
last year and is running true again,
while Long’s work is more than sat-
isfactory.

In the outfield there is a lot of good
material, but the three positions seem
to lie between Richards, Vance, Ol-
ford, Marrow, and Wells. Soine of
these men are handling the willow
over home plate in ‘ly Cobb style, a
good indication that Davidson will
have plenty of pinch hitters.

Practically every man trying out
for baseball will be given an oppor-
tunity to demonstrate his ability on
lext Saturday afternoon, when a prac-
ice game will be held on Sprunt Field.
This game will no doubt be a deter-
mining factor in the selection of a
nine for the first game of the season,
on March 30th, when Oak Ridge in-
vades local territory,

In spite of the fact that only five
letter men are out this season, Coach
Buck and Captain Pat are pleased

with the large number of experienced
men who are available for the squad,
and anticipate a sukcessful season.
Dutch Hengeveld, college registrar,
is assisting with the coaching—as-
sistance of no mean value, since Dutch
was a winning pitcher in the South-
ern League for several years, and
later successfullly coached the David-
sonians. &
Manager Elliott had the interest of
the students at heart when arranging
the schedule, for out of 21 games
slated for the season, eleven will be
played on Sprunt Field. That means
every student will have a good oppor-
tunity to see the Wildcats in action on
the diamond and to get in behind the
team and support it.
