Committee examines club sports:
teams seek recognition, funding

By JIM ENTWHISTLE
Staff Writer

The role of club sports in the
college community is currently
being examined by a commit-
tee headed by the Assistant
Dean of Students, Mary Lou
Dietler. This committee was
established last spring as an
ad hoc committee from the
Dean of Students Office in
response to concerns that had
been expressed by students
involved in club sports.

“The various clubs are ex-
periencing very real prob-
lems,” asserted Dietler, ‘‘be-
cause the college has never
recognized them or assigned
them any priority in the
scheme of things around
here.”’

In addition to the question
of the status of the clubs, the
other main concerns center
around funding for the sports
and the use of college playing

fields.

The Athletic Department is
supposed to provide $1200-
$2000 a year for the club
sports, to be divided between
each club depending on their
financial needs. Jeff Morrow,
Rugby Club President, said
that he has been receiving

$150 a year from this fund, but:

Steve Crane, co-president of
the Hockey Club, complained,
‘‘For the past three or four
years we haven’t gotten any
funds and we haven’t been
able to get any accounting
from the college as to where
the funds are going.”’

The Hockey Club did re-
ceive $330 this year which will
go towards the purchase of
protective equipment and the
rental of a full-size rink so that
the club can play competitive-
ly.

A lack of communication
seems to be the problem

concerning the use of college
fields by club sports. Tradi-
tionally the rugby club has
practiced on the lower soccer
field, but after conflicts devel-
oped with intramurals and the
women’s field hockey team,
the ruggers began to reserve
the field for several hours a
week.

“Reserving the field didn’t
seem to make any difference,’’
Morrow said. ‘“There seems to
be no contact at all between
the intramural program and
the Athletic Department.’’
The college is currently con-
structing two more playing
fields next to the baseball field
in an attempt to alleviate
scheduling conflicts.

Funding discrepancies and
practice field conflicts are but
two of the many aspects of the
club sports that will be exam-
ined by Dietler’s committee.

NC PIRG moves into action

By ANTHONY EVERMAN
Staff Writer

After four years at David-
son College, the North Carol-
ina Public Interest Research
Group has begun to reap tang-
ible benefits from its initial
goals. Now NC PIRG is
providing action and not just
information.

Relevant to college stu-
dents’ daily lives was PIRG’s
publication of the Tenants
Handbook. It is: particularly
useful to those students who
are living off campus and have
been subjected to the whims of
irresponsible landlords for the
first time. ;

The handbook suggests that
maintenance of a property is a
two-way street. John Hedrick,
state chairman of NC PIRG,
stated that the handbook
showed that ‘‘tenants ae
owners should know their o
and each other’s responsibili-

ties.”” The new handbook is a
means of doing just that.

A major concern of PIRG is
in the area of nuclear power.
According to Hedrick, they
are ‘‘cautiously optimistic’”’
about making some headway
toward obtaining “some new
hearings on the subject from
the Utility Review Commit-
tee.”’

To inform the populace of
both sides of any question is a
primary desire of PIRG.
PIRG claims that ‘‘on the
issue of nuclear power, the
public gets only the sides of
the utilities.”

PIRG considers it should be
its duty to make sure that
‘the people understand the
drawbacks of nuclear power
and the potential of finding
other sources of energy.”’

PIRG is interested in labor-
atory procedures at Research
Triangle Park in Durham. No

adequate standards have been
issued in regard to safety of
equipment. An example of the
effects of these oversights was
seen when a lab worker was
exposed to a cancer-producing
agent. PIRG has filed a com-
plaint with the EPA on this
matter.

From a follow-up report on
the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, PIRG
has discovered great inequal-
ity in OSHA’s treatment of
various businesses. OSHA
gave an inordinate amount of
attention to small business-
men and fined them for most
violations of safety regula-
tions while giving random
minimal fines to some larger
corporations and .ignoring
most of them.

According to Hedrick,
“OSHA is the case of a good

be-re-examined by schools all
over the country because of
the increasing student partici-
pation and fan interest in this
level of competition. The com-
mittee here is taking a close
look at how various other
schools have dealt with this
sudden interest in club sports.

Dietler’s committee, now
under the auspices of the
Council on Campus and Relig-
ious Life, consists of Thom
Cartmill, Chip Stone and
Sterling Martin from the Ath-
letic Department, Dr. Koller
representing the Council on
Campus and Religious Life,
two SGA representatives and
the presidents and treasurers
from the football, ice hockey,
rugby, lacrosse, water skiing
and soccer clubs.

The result of the commit-
tee’s work will be a report to
the Council on Campus and
Religious Life containing in-
formation on past problems
concerning club sports and
recommendations for the fu-
ture. A deadline of December 1
has been set for this report so
that it can be presented to the
Trustees and so that when
next year’s budget is devel-
oped, guidelines as to how
much money should be allo-
cated to club sports will be
available.

Since the past status of club
sports has been so nebulous,
the committee is starting from
scratch in tis attempt to deal
with the situation. The first

step_was to have each club
president provide background
on the club’s sporting philoso-
phy, long range goals and
current needs.

Another elementary step is
the process of defining exactly
what a club sport is, whether,
it must compete athletically to
come under this heading and
whether organizations such as
the Outing Club and Chess
Club should be included.

Another major issue is the
question of to whom the club
sports are accountable. The
Athletic Department has ask-
ed for a definite policy on this.
Athletic Director Thom
Cartmill said, “I really don’t
care whether it is decided by
Mary Lou’s Committee to
place the clubs under my
department or not. I would
prefer basically to have them
under student control since
the clubs and varsity sports
have divergent aims and be-
cause some aspects of the
clubs, such as the playing of
games on Sundays and the use
of alcoholic beverages at their
games are not compatible
with intercollegiate sports. I
can understand and accept
these activities, but it is a
different philosophy from the
varsity sports program.”

Tim Sellers, Club Football
president, said that club
sports possibly could end up
under the SGA. “‘What we’re
