This Year And The Next

The Quips and Cranks, official death
certificate for the academic year, has
now been released, and we may sit
back and watch as the “continuing
college community” (or more recently
the “greater academic (w)hole”’) settles
into typical summer rigor mortis.

Your editors, however, cannot re-
sist a few post mortem comments on
the significant events, successes, and
failures of the year just passing.

PROMISES

There were several events during
the past year that deserve special at-
tention because they hold special
promise and significance for the fu-
ture of the college oyer the next dec-
ades.

Chief among these has to be listed
the hiring of John Bevan to be David-
son’s vice president for academic af-
fairs. This man, if reports of his past
successes are’ accurate indications of
his future in academic reform, could
initiate great improvements in David-
son’s educational system.

Reactionary comments by David-
son’s more flagrant conservatives to
the contrary notwjthstanding, the Blue
Sky Report has led to many signifi-
cant and much to be desired changes
in the academic system at this col-
lege. More changes. are in order
though, and a freer spirit of innova-
tion such as that found at Florida Pres-
byterian ‘where Bevan has’ served
might actually make Davidson a lib-
eral arts institution worthy of its pres-
ently distorted and bloated image.

Along these same lines and of al-
most equal significance was the estab-
lishment of the Honors College. While
the worth of this institution also re-
mains to be proved sometime 4in’ the
future. it seems a valuable step in
improving the often pedantic atmos-
phere of education at Davidson.

Perhaps just“as significant an ad-
vance for Davidson during the past
school year was the establishment of
WDAV—perhaps. We must reserve
judgment on this matter because the
effect of the radio station will, also
be known only in the future.

As President Spencer pointed out
in his remarks on the inaugural broad-
cast, WDAV will have ‘primary impact
on the college Only in the manner ™
which it influences the Davidson edu-
cational system. While this point was
somehow missed or ignored by tie
others. who burned up the-rest of the
first ten minutes of air time, It Is a
point which cannot be disregarded

MOODS

To judge the mood of the campus
as it might or might not have changed
over the past year is more difficult
than to review past events, but signs
are encouraging.

It is time that Davidson ceased to
be known as a “safe” place to send
one’s son. Rather, this school should
be highly dangerous in the sense that
one could here be exposed to new and
even radical ideas which view issues
on the basis of merit rather than pop-
ular support. No longer should it be
‘possible for Davidson to be deemed
safe even by the D.A.R. io

In isolated instances the “official”
picture was more encouraging than
ever before (but in isolated instances
only). Spencer’s flag-lowering resolu-
tion, his statement to members of
Congress and the faculty peace vigil
all, seemed signs of growing concern
with extra-campus issues.

Hope-inspiring signs of greater ac-
tivism among students were obvious
over the past year. The two moratori-
um observances, the joining of -the
National Student Association, protests
over the President’s. actions in Cam-
bodia and Southeast Asia in generai,
and mest recently the ROTC protests
were very encouraging signs.

But the campus is far from radical-
ized, for to balance these apparent
changes in mood there were numer-
ous indications of apparent moods
that seemed ’to push the campus back
for every step it might have made for-
ward.

Part of the Sigma Chi house disaf-
filiated from its national’ office last
fall, and that was a good sign. But

B.C.

now the house is again firmly in na-
tional control—a bad sign. Peter Hob-
bie led the largest anti-rush campaign
ever, a step forward, but 84 percent
of the freshmen pledged fraternities
(a step into the past). Students. or
many of them, were enraged at the
injustices at Kent State, but similar
violence at Jackson State was virtu-
ally ignored.

In short, the past year has shown
that the minority of students trying
to liberalize this campus face an al-
most hopeless battle with entrenched
conservatism and apathy. We wish
them luck.

‘SETBACKS

It is unfortunate that official ac-
tions deserve all too much of the
blame for stifling constructive change
at this college. What are. concerned
students to think when, for instance,
the faculty refuses to eliminate com-
pulsory examination requirements and
further tightens its rules on taking
class attendance?

What are concerned students to
think when the faculty operates with-
in a Code of Responsibility at the
same time that they are killing a pro-
posal for 24-hour open dorms? Or.
what are students to think of a Board
of Trustees who affirm i ra for
coeducation “in principle’ but leave
that principle with its accompaniment
of girls somewhere in the misty. fu-
ture by refusing to take steps to make
the principle a reality?

Students just might begin to won-
der (as the growth of ad hoc commit-
tees over the past year would indi-
cate) exactly how they can work to
stop this undesirable course of events.

DELAYS

But in spite of a few promising
signs however gossamer and many
discouraging signs however concrete,
significant changes are still pending
here at the college. We look to action

over the summer and next fall to
bring important progress to David-
son.

Perhaps the greatest problem which
will be hung over from this year to
the next is that of fraternities. We
refuse to‘add further to the literature
on the subject other than to say that
the Student Life Committee. (SLC) is

studying the matter. According to
Spencer they. are to propose nifi
cant changes for campus social lite
to the Board of Trustees next fall. We
look to the trustees for positive ac-
{atoyad, :

Also still in abeyance are the three
commission reports on Social Life, Ex-
tra-Campus Responsibility, and Church
Relationship. In these. areas too ‘we
wait for significant action from the
trustees.

The Code of Responsibility with its
associated courts system is also due
a review. In this area too the SLC is
contemplating action. At present there
are both students and faculty who
like to claim that the Code is not
working. We number ourselves among
their opponents. In both positions cer-
tain changes in the Code are recog-
nized as necessary, and again we look
to’ the trustees for specific action.

Finally there is the problem of
‘campus governance. Davidson’s con-
stipated bureaucracy is in desperate
need of change simply because it is
not acting as it should.to produce
needed changes in other areas of the
school. This too is a problem expect-
ed to confront the trustees next fall.

A REQUEST

In short, the past year has been for
Davidson one of some progress and
indications of future progress as it is
hoped all years can be. It has been a
year of some-significant setbacks as
no year should be. And it has left us
with a host of problems begging for
immediate attention.,

We ask the trustees for the atten-
tion these issues deserve. No one can
be working more within the “system”
than that. But no one can get further
out of the system than a group whose.
urgent needs are ignored.

To the Editor:

1 must admire and com-
mend Professors Jackson,
Kaylor, and Gaige for the
sort of approach they have
taken in their anti-war dis-
cussion and protest. The na-
ture.of the protest is a new
turn in protests that is the
most healthy thing I've seen
in a long time.

The normal or old style of
protest can not really be
seen as attempting to better
a situation at all. This old

Because of our lack of

guard their property.

If the thefts were, in fact,
committed by students, it
is a pity that such warnings
are necessary at an institu-
tion that predicates its con-
duct on an honor code.

form that I am referring to

bal attacks on those who dis-
agree with the protest.

I can not see how it is
possible to influence others
in the country to bring
about an end to the war by
insulting their way of life,
their society, their cultural
and moral standards, and
their treasured institutions.

A person can not be very
easily influenced to see

one’s point of view by call-
ing him a fascist, a bigot,
a chauvinist,.a reactionary,
or even a hated member of
“the establishment” or an
effete honkey. ;

The new turn taken by
Jackson, Gaige, and = Kay-

Uncle Percival’s
“Wart Remover

‘ By David  Siveatt
The Bitter End?

The Frenchman Maillard reports, ‘“‘It is always the
violence of the oppressor that unleashes the violence
of the oppressed.”

Violence is not essentially intertwined with tumult
and brutal blows and human bodies
writhing in agony. Violence is equal-
ly as real, more pervasive-and more
iniquitous in its quieter forms.

There is violence here.

For decades Davidson has had ef }
the idea that every problem could :
be solved by rules and “good will’.
This superficial idealism, refusing to <u
recognize the qniet violence, paves
the way for violence to break out - ;
in retaliation. . ph

Today, administrators and faculty Say!

members are stunned when students SWEATT
reward their “good will” and their
“we-only-carry-out-the-rules” answers with revilement
But that is because they have never examined the real-
ity, because their ideals are based on a superficial
idealism.
__ What is worse than the pap doled out °to students
in such condescending gestures as “open meetings” is
the possibility that these guys actually believe that
they are saying something. :

Pull back the veil of smiles and gentle tones, and
the meetings turn out tobe just a sop, a bribe to buy
time and hope that the students will forget about the
whole thing. In the case of the Ad Hoe Committee
many of us are seniors (not playing our role—seniors
are supposed to be completely apathetic) and it is: ob-
vious that if things could be put off long enough they
could .be put off forever. Unfortunately for students
this strategy of attrition has been a complete success.
_ And so the hypocrisy goes on: students fall vic-
tims to the quiet violence of committees that are “only
enforcing the rules.” The rules may be stupid, even
insane, but they are enforced with the utmost moral-
istic dedication. :
_. It’s not criminal to make mistakes, it’s not even
immoral. And it is axiomatic for men to believe that
they have always been fair, just, and all that other
jazz. But at the cost of other peoples’ lives?

The fog of uncertainty that surrounded the first
year of the Spencer administration has been. burned
away by the events of this school year: drug trials.
open dorms, the scuttling of the Ad Hoc Committee.
and most recently by the strictures placed on the per-
formance of a student’s play.

It is apparent now, even to those who long defend-
ed the new administration from its critics. that the
students don’t have a president of the College.

It is the “Continuing College Community” that has
a president, deans, and administrators here. The Col-
