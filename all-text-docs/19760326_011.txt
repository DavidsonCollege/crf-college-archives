Fifth National filled with possibilities

By PAUL WELCH
Staff Writer

For two thirds of the academic
year, it is almost possible to walk
through the Cunningham Building
and ask yourself, ‘‘Is there no interest
in graphic art on this campus?”’ Then
spring arrives, and the Art Depart-
ment decorates its caverns with visual
delights.

The fifth annual Davidson National
Print and Drawing Competition is

just that: a delight. For the first time -

in four years, I missed the opening on
Sunday, but since then I have spent
about three hours just wandering
through it. I have yet to exhaust the
possibilities.

Possibilites...there are pieces in
this show to tantalize with endless
ambiguity. There are experiments
with the shape of space like David
Mocarski’s ‘‘Container Structure
Number One’”’ and Lydia Okumura’s
“The Appearance.” Pieces like these
fascinate me becauselit seems that
their primary concern is not pictorial
content but the physical space which
that content encloses or is enclosed
by.

The concern with space is closely
connected with perceptual qualities.
A print like Gary Stephan’s “‘If-Then:

Barnet’s ‘‘Dawn.’

F” uses textured paper and a micro-
scopic difference in physical height to
create an effect which is sculptural.
That big orange mass somehow seems
to thrust itself out of a two-

dimensional frame as if it were a block -

of granite.

Doug Moran’s ‘‘End Cap’”’ uses
stripes of masking tape to develop a
similar feeling in the viewer. This
mixed-media piece affected me as a
rug or tapestry might: I wanted to
move it away from the wall to look at
more than one side at once.

In works like these two and others,
traditional perspective is altered to
create visual paradoxes. Which way
does the door open in Railey Macey’s
“Exit’’? Surely not in two directions
at once...but that’s the way it looks.

Among my favorites in the group of
works that play tricks with,.the eye
and mind are an untitled piece by
Balewski (catalogue #10), Richard
Hamwi'’s ‘‘Again Number One’’, and
“Street Corner’ by Bruce McCombs.
I also liked John Catterall’s ‘Painted
Wall Five.”

In more traditional areas, I fell in
love with two women and a landscape,
not necessarily in that order. The
women may be seen in Hoover’s ‘“‘Our
Lady of the Sacred Cats’’ and
’ The landscape is.

LAST NATIONAL? Herb Jackson and Laura Grosh at
Sunday’s opening of the fifth Davidson National

that of Gordon Mortenson’s delicate
woodcut, “Late Summer’’.

I responded negatively to very few
pieces in this show. Notable among
my un-favorites were Sarah
Lambert’s charcoal, appropriately
titled ‘‘No’’, and J.D. Boyd’s intag-

environment as does Michael

Schnorr’s “Coyote.”

There also seems to be a strong
verbal element involved. Many of
these works use printed or hand-
written words as elements of
composition. Look, for example, at

“CORNER” by William Graham.

lio, ‘‘Domestic Scene’’. Just what is
that dog getting ready to do,
anyway?

The first response provoked by
many of these works is laughter. For
a good giggle, look at McClearly’s
“Berry Me Not on the Lone Prairie’,
or Macaulay’s ‘‘Parthenon, East
Face.”’

Besides being humorous,
Macaulay’s work is an example of
juror Marcia Tucker’s concern for art
as process rather than technique.

As I understand it, this‘;concern
elevates the act of constructing a
work to a position above that of the
means and materials used. Process
pieces may integrate materials

directly from the artist’s or subject’s

The Davidson National will be open from
7:30 AM. to 10:30 P.M. weekdays,9 AM to

5 P.M. Saturaays, and 2 to 5 on Sundays
in Cunningham Fine Arts building .

Gloria Mahnke’s ‘‘Birdleg’’ and
Steven Cortright’s ‘‘Probability.”

The juxtapositon of visual and
verbal elements creates problems for
the viewer/reader not unlike those
raised in this review.

As H. H. Arnason has noticed,
‘‘the two experiences (reading and
seeing) are essentially different and it
must always be recognized that the
words of the interpreter are at best
only an approximation of the visual
work of art.”

What this pseudo-intellectual con-
clusion is trying to get you to do is
thus essentially self-defeating. Stop
reading this review and go look at the
Davidson National. And hurry. It
may not be there next year.
