Illegal Rushing Prompts PCC
To Threaten Fines On Houses

By MIKE TANNER
Asst. Managing Editor

In a meeting of the Patterson
Court Council (PCC) Monday
night, a resolution was passed
giving the council the authority
to levy fines on the court houses
if they violate the spirit of the
council by-laws and the new
social system in their approach
to recruiting freshmen.

The fine for such violations
was set at $100 per freshman
involved in the violation.

According to PCC President
Jim Thompson, the primary
reason for the resolution was to
invest the council with
the responsibility as the
authority to investigate
activities of the houses that it
feels may cause inequalities in
the eourt’s dealings with
freshmen.

“This is a means to insure
that the freshmen have an equal
chance in deciding to join a

its full enrollment a significant
number of students will be
black men and black women.
Critical in this recruitment are
the ability to attract black
women and the support of
presently enrolled black
students.

BSC: With no_- specific
information or commitment in
terms of actual numbers, there
is a question as to what the
Administration considers a

‘‘significant’’ number of black
students.
FACILITIES -- BSC: The

facility for the coalition should
expand in proportion to the
increasing number of black
students, as should its budget.
The facility will cease to exist
when black students and the
Administration feel that it is no
longer necessary.

FEC: Agreement seems to
have been reached that as more
black students are enrolled
there should be less necessity
for separate meeting facilities.
In the meantime, present
quarters shall be retained and
maintained.

Peck: It seems to us that as
the number of black students
increases there would be more
need for a house and more
facilities. Contacts within the
school are limited due to
prevailing social attitudes, so
there will always be a need for
organizations such as the BSC.

FACULTY - BSC: Several
black faculty members within
the next two years, appointed in
consultation with the BSC.

FEC: Chairmen of the
departments where
appointments are to be made
for the next academic year
have been asked to search out
black professors they would
recommend. Ordinarily, black
students will have the
opportunity to visit with black
condidates to the faculty. We
will look into the many avenues

of visiting, adjunct, and
exchange professorship
arrangements.

BSC: We find it hard to
believe that no qualified black
faculty members have been
found and feel that no really
concerted effort has been made.

Peck: We wonder whether the
idea of having black professors
of other schools come here was
an effort to keep from having to
take action ourselves. These
are still not Davidson faculty. A
lot of people don’t realize the
importance for a black student

to have a black professor to
discuss academic problems
with.

SOCIAL LIFE -- BSC: Social
programming has been
blatantly neglected. There is a
need for social privileges with
black colleges in the area.

FEC: Arrangements will be
explored for coordinating and
funding programs with
neighboring black schools. and
there will be increased efforts
at being more sensitive to the
needs of black students in
planning student social events.
The real change in social life
depends primarily on the
presence of more black
students on campus.

BSC: The suggestions place
most of the responsibility on
other institutions. Although we
feel such programs’ and
relationships may be profitable
to the schools involved, we
believe that Davidson should
play a more definite role.

ACTIVITIES TRANSPORTA-
TION -- BSC: A car pool for use
by only student organizations,
at least one vehicle within the
oresent school vear.

FEU: The principle of a
Student activities car has been
approved by the SGA Senate
and final action awaits the
working out of details.

Peck: There's a misun-
derstanding about the
idea of who gets priority in the
use of the car. Our original
proposal was that all students
would use it; it was the SGA’s
idea that the BSC would have
first preference.

The FEC’s report includes an
appendix which contains the
draft of an exchange with
Morehouse College. a sample of
letters being sent out to recruit
black faculty members, and a
letter from Dean of Students
Will Terry to Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
pevan concerning black social
ife.

There is also the proposal for
the purchase of a student car
and a report from Asst.
Director of the College Union
Peter Sterling on his recent
visit to Johnson C. Smith
University.

Bevan, who compiled the
report for the FEC, felt that the
college is further along in its
efforts to meet the special needs
of black students because of the
BSC’s requests.

‘The Administration said
they'd present us with another
installment,’ Peck noted.
‘We're hoping they'll make
things a lot more concrete.”

... Pass-Fail System

(Continued From Page 1)
can’t do C work he ought not to
pass,’ said Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan. Since the pass-fail
option was created at Davidson,
only a handful of students have
not passed.

In addition to Extended
Studies which is graded on a
pass-fail basis, juniors and
seniors can take a maximum of
one pass-fail course each term.

This adds up to a possible
maximum of three a year or
four including Extended
Studies. Courses in a student's
major may not be taken pass-
fail.

Most Upperclassmen who
have taken courses under the
pass-fail option agree that it
was beneficial. The basic
concensus is that the option
enables the student to
concentrate on two courses, and
so make better grades in them
while at the same time
avoiding the worry of a grade in
a pass-fail course.

None of those questioned
were experiencing difficulty

maintaining the C average
necessary to pass. Most
students use the pass-fail option
to fulfill area requirements or
to take a course which they
might otherwise be afraid to
take.

An average of 70 students per
term have taken courses pass-
fail over the years. The number
has ranged from a low of close
to 50 to a high of around 90.

A study conducted at the
University of Iowa found that
better students (3.0 or above)
take significantly more pass-
fail than those with GPA
between 2.0 and 2.5.

It was also found that lower
level courses are taken over
twice as much as upper level
courses.

Bevan calls pass-fail ‘‘a good
option because it presents an
alternative to the grade.”

Frederickson agrees, adding,

“that it encourages a student to
try new things."

But if a student plans to
attend graduate school, he
should be careful how many
courses he takes pass-fail.

house, without all of the rushing
and bidding complications,’
Thompson said.

Thompson went on to say that
the fine was not automatic.
That is, if the PCC feels that a
house is violating the by-laws,
then it will be discussed within
the council before deciding
what action should be taken.

“This is not so much a threat,
but rather we hope that it will
act as a deterant to infractions
and thus insure equal and
unilateral cooperation between
the houses in their social
functions, especially with the
freshmen,’’ Thompson said.

Much of the discussion
centered around the recent
actions taken by Sigma Phi
Epsilon (SPE) in rushing
freshmen. The PCC felt that
this type of behavior conflicted
with the self-select system and
thus the philosophy of
Davidson's equal-opportunity
social system and that such
actions by houses in the future
should be discouraged.

Thompson made it clear
however, that Monday's
resolution does not effect any
previous activities by the
houses.

The apparent problem with
the resolution, concerning
specifically SPE and their off-
campus status. is the
enforceability of actions taken
by the PCC.

When asked his feelings about
the resolution, Random House
President Dan Thorne said that
in light of the SPE’s off-campus
situation, he doubts that the
PCC has any jurisdiction over
their social functions.

SPE is an_ off-campus
national fraternity which eats
on campus together with Phi
Gamma Delta (Phi Gams), in
Random House.

Thorne pointed out that while
SPE is on campus and acting as
a part of Random House, they
abide with Random House in
honoring the policies of the PCC
in their social functions.

‘‘When Random House partys
on campus, SPE and Phi Gam
do it as Random House and
cooperate fully with the PCC,”
Thorne said.

Thorne pointed out that on
campus, the PCC could enforce
its new resolution, but once SPE
leaves campus, they are a
national fraternity responsible
for their own socializing which
in effect, should be their own
business.

“To ask Random House to be
responsible for SPE's off-
campus activities or even to
penalize SPE on campus as a
part of Random _ House,
inasmuch as they abide by the

rules, is ridiculous,’ Thorne
said.
“The PCC is asking the whole

house to be responsible for the
actions of its members when
they aren't members,”’ he
added.

Career /Service

Fees Reduced

Fees for participation in the
Career/Service program have
been reduced, Program
Director Randall R. Kincaid
Jr. announced. ,

Students earning one credit
through Career/Service will
now pay one ninth of the tuition
portion of the comprehensive
fee plus an administrative fee of
$75. Formerly, students paid a
$150 or $200 administrative fee
plus one ninth of the tuition.

Those Career/Service
participants who earn no course
credit will pay only an

administrative fee of $75,
according to the new policy.

There has been no change in
the fee for students earning two
or more course credits. They
will pay the tuition portion of
the comprehensive fee.
