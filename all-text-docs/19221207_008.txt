pensing cabbages at 10 cents each. There

FRESH TEAM DEFEATS
CLEMSON FRESH, 20-7

By playing rings around and overrunning
Clemson, 20-7, the Wildcat Freshmen closed

the South Carolina Agriculture College on
Turkey Day. This victory brought to a suc-
cessful close the first schedule that the Da-
vidson Fresh have ever attempted, a sum-
mary of the past season revealing three vic-
tories, one tie ,and two losses.

The Clemson rats opened the game with a
rush and before the visitors had steadied
themselves, managed to push over a touch-
down, making the extra point with a suc-
cessful drop-kick.

But then the tide turned. The Wildkittens
came back with pep and the unexpected, in
the form of Captain Baker intercepting a
pass and ambling 65 yards for a touchdown,
and the half closed with the score standing
at 7-all.

This seemed to take the starch out of the
South Carolina rats, and Captain Sappen-
field, opening the third period with a flash-
ing series of forward passes, quickly car-
ried the ball within striking distance of the
South Carolinians goal, where Laird rushed
it-over for the second touchdown.

Davidson’s third touchdown came when
Baker, in the final period, fell on a blocked
punt behind Clemson's goal line.

A deplorable accident occurred on the
kick-off when Doughton, Davidson’s 1eft
tackle, had his leg broken when he was cut
from the-side. He was sent to the Presby-
terian hospital in Charlotte where an opera-

#| tion was found necessary. It will be several |
#| weeks before he will be able to return to
i#i| the campus,

DAVIDSON FIVE
YEARS AGO _

The Davidson Wildcats on last Saturday
held the heavy Remount Team from Camp
Greene to a scoreless tie. ‘The day was per-
fect for football and a large crowd of service
men turned out to see the struggle. The game
was featured by the defensive playing of
Davidson.

Much disappointment is felt on the campus
on account of the Clemson game being
played at Clemson College instead of Char-
lotte.

The sorrow of the student body at losing
Mr. Moore, the “Y” secretary, was shown
by the record-breaking attendance at Shearer
Hall last Sunday night.

A Davidson College alumni association has
just been formed. in China, according to a
letter from Frank W. Price, ’16. It will be
of interest to his many friends to know
that he is on his way to America now.
