Sanguinary Sapiens

The front of smoke lofts so high

as God’s Breath descends upon her lands.
Her breath claps the brilliance of orange, yellow, and
red.
With all the beauty Autumn bears,

She forebodes a period of death
Her organic wonders disappear

till one remains as the Autumn leaf that runs no-
where.
