Phi and Eu Societies
have a long history

By Towner Blackstock

It’s hard to know what to say
about the Phi and Eu Societies.
Most Davidson students drift by
the original 1849 Literary Society
Hallson the old quadrangle of cam-
pus with nothing more than a ca-
sual thought. Most of us have our
minds set on getting to class, fin-
ishing that paper, or getting to bed
after that traumatic all-nighter. Eu
and Phi Halls stand like museum
relics, showpieces of history for
gawking tourist-like parents to visit
as their children finally graduate.
But there’s much more there than
what most folks get the chance to
see.

The Eumenean Debating So-
ciety and the Philanthropic Liter-
ary Society still exist, and even
meet regularly in their original
upstairs meeting rooms.

But what to say about these
two groups? Originally founded
in 1837 by Davidson students, they
served “as a means of improve-
ment:not to be secured in the regu-
lar college work,” according to the
Eumenean minutes.

Since “college work” boiled
down to sheer rote memorization
of classical languages, mathemat-
ics and, in the latter two years,
some sciences, students had nary a
chance to think for themselves in
class. So society activity took up
the.slack, .according,.to the .Pre-
amble of the Phi Society, provid-
ing for “the study of rhetoric, logic,
andethic” and seeking to inculcate
“ahigh regard for virtue and truth.”

They also provided a source
of friendship and mutual aid among
“those we feel interested and deem
worthy of our esteem.” To this

end, membership in each group
came by invitation only, and all
business was strictly secret.

Inthe twice-weekly meetings,
students accepted topics for pre-
sentation the next meeting. Some
would debate the topic, while oth-
ers would write formal papers or
deliver speeches. Topics included
political and social issues ranging
from the justice of the Mexican
war to “is female education of as
much importance as male educa-
tion.”

To support this rigorous self-
education, the societies built im-
pressive libraries. Phi’s grew to
1,000 volumes by 1846. The col-
lege library grew much more
slowly, since the curriculum did
not require the kind of intense re-
search the literary societies did.
Only in 1886 did the three libraries
merge for a total of 10,000 vol-
umes.

Phi and Eu that year published
the Davidson Monthly, featuring
original articles and works, and
laternews. Renamed the Davidson
College Magazine in 1897, it con-
tinued under society sponsorship
until superseded by the college-
funded Davidsonian in 1916.

The societies frankly domi-
nated every aspect of campus life.
In addition to debate, speaking,
and writing, they acted as student
government associations. Occa-
sionally, they even expelled mem-
bers from the society, and even
from the college (for plagiarism,
and with the ex post facto support
of the faculty).

In this way they provided the
roots of our current honor system.
But like today, not everything

Almost ignored by today's students, the campus once centered around events held in Eu Hall.

worked out so smoothly. Rivalry
led to division, such as the time the
entire Eu membership threatened
to leave if they did not get as many
dorm rooms as the Phis. It also led
to unity, when in 1854 both mem-
berships did leave in protest of a
fellow student’s expulsion.

Over the years, the societies
lost their secret aspects, and lost
some prominence as social alter-
natives increased around the cam-
pus. The train eventually stopped
in town, and faculty discipline re-
laxed enough to allow greater stu-
dent freedoms. Fraternities arrived,
six strong in 1896, and the curricu-
lum expanded to include opportu-
nities for formal writing and de-
bate.

The functions of the societies
slipped away tocollege-sponsored
groups like the SGA, Honor Coun-
cil, various publications, and the
Union. Even the Commencement
ceremonies, once entirely orga-

nized by Eu and Phi, finally fell
under college control. With these
functions went membership, with
numbers dwindling since the thir-
ties to the point that each group
went defunct at one time or an-
other.

Today, Phi continues to meet
on Sundaysat nine. Usually mem-
bers read works along agiventopic,
and occasionally sponsor presen-
tations of original works by stu-
dents and faculty members.

Eu was revived just a couple
of years ago, and held a prospec-
tive meeting last Thursday. Lately
they’ve been known for their “cof-
fee houses,” evening times when
anyone can drop by Eu Hall, have
a drink and talk about books, is-
sues, or whatever. Keep youreyes
open for each group’s flyers around
campus advertising their events.
And just so you know, Eu is the
one closest to Main Street; Phi is
the one closest to Chambers.

One hundred and forty-three
years have passed since Eu and Phi
Halls were built with funds raised
by the Eumeneanand Philanthropic
Societies. Like ‘neo-classical
American temples, the Halls stand,
reminding us of what things once

‘were like, and how Davidsonis not

always so much different as it is
grown up.

Thesocieties themselves have
been displaced as the direct tenets
of our honor and integrity, but that
spirit lingers on and pervades our
entire Davidson experience.

Campaign for Davidson well on way to $150 million mark

Campaign continued from pg 1

$45 million to enhance the physi-
cal facilities of the campus. As the
number of students increases, so
do the number of needs. Baker
Sports Complex was one of the
first majorimprovements afforded
by the Campaign, new student
housing and a new college Union
may be later developments.

The campaign hopes to diver-
sify and enrich the student body
with $25 million for scholarships
and student support programs.
“Since the campaign began,” Jamie
May says, “73 new scholarships

have been created.” Another $25
million will be put towards
strengthening academic resources
by improving the library, attract-
ing visiting scholars and lecturers,
and enhancing junior/senior year
options.

The last $15 million will goto
strengthen the Annual Fund.
Briefly, the Annual Fund finances
approximately 11% of the yearly
operating budget. The Annual
Fund takes care of the difference
between what students pay to at-
tend Davidson and whatit actually
costs to educate them. .

Although 82% of the $150

million has been raised, this does
not mean that Davidson can go on
a spending frenzy anytime soon.
Some of the money is pledged and
therefore will not be expendable
until the pledges are paid, which
usually takes 2-3 years. Even
money that is not pledged is not
usually available for immediate
use, since many donations go to
the Endowment.

The Endowment is similar to
a trust fund, because the school
only spends 5% of its endowment
earnings (which come from invest-
ments). The other 95% of the
earnings are reinvested in the prin-

cipal, enabling the Endowment to
grow as costs rise.

Currently Davidson has four
different firms managing the En-
dowment as effectively and with
as little risk as possible. This kind
of conservative planning only gives
Davidson between $9-$15 million
cash to spend per year, even though
so much money has been donated.

Vast amounts of money come
from parents and friends of
Davidson College, but foundations
who are aware of the excellence of
the faculty and student body here
also contribute. According to Toby
Bethea, Vice President of Institu-

tional Advancement, “President
Emeritus Sam Spencer really
brought foundation awareness of
Davidson up to par, and people
like Dr. Kuykendall have enhanced
it.” The largest contribution so far
was the Duke Endowment at
$7,976,000.

The Campaign for Davidson
is obviously a milestone in the
history of Davidson. In a recent
survey of college fund-raising con-
ducted by Claremont McKenna
College, Davidson ranked second
only to Williams College in mon-
etary gifts to private schools for
the fiscal year 92-93.
