Professor Clinton McCann re-
tums to Davidson after twelve
years and joins the religion depart-
ment as a visiting assistant profes-
sor. McCann graduated from
Davidson in 1973. This term he is
teaching an introduction to the
New Testament, and a course on
the history and religion of ancient
Israel.

McCann grew up in
Greensboro, North Carolina, and,
after graduating from Davidson,
attended Union Theological
Seminary in Richmond, Virginia,
where he received his Doctor of
the Ministry degree in 1977, and
his Master of Theology degree in
1978. He has recently received his
Ph.D. in biblical studies from
Duke University.

He and his wife, Nancy, co-
pastor three Presbyterian
churches, and have served in this
capacity since 1978. They have
one daughter, Jennifer, who will
be four next month. McCann’s
personal interests include jog-
ging, team sports, and spending
time with his family.

He notes that perhaps the most
noticeable difference in the
Davidson community since his
time here is the admission of
women in 1972, which he views
as a definite change for the better.

He sees. the. Davidson students as.

being conscientious, _—-welll-
rounded, and one high quality.

vestigates women writers in En-
glish 135, and educates freshmen
on the art of composition, in
another English course.

In coming to Davidson, Mills
felt that“... the faculty, par-
ticularly in the English depart-
ment, (was) intelligent, and also
very warm... ” She finds the
campus beautiful and the E.H.
Little Library to her liking, small
and accomodating. Mills finds
that Davidson students challenge
you in a good way. She sees them
“|. . (challenging) teachers to be
good students.”

Mills is originally from nearby
Statesville, North Carolina, and
attended Agnes Scott College in
Atlanta, Georgia for three years.
She is a graduate of the University
of Texas in El Paso, where she
also received her master’s degree.
She received her Ph.D. from the
University of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill.

Mills and William, her hus-
band of twenty years, have three
boys ages sixteen, fourteen, and
five. Mr. Mills, a 1964 graduate
of Davidson College, is a
businessman and serves the public
as a county commisioner in Iredell
County. Mills enjoys reading,
gardening, and cooking, of which
Mexican food is her specialty.

campus activities as well. She is
the newly-appointed advisor for
the International Committee, a
task about which she is quite en-
thusiastic. Working with Jack
Perry, she has helped to initiate
the International students into the
DC campus and, with Perry, has
organized a “4:30 Forum” to meet
on Thursdays for the interaction of
American and International stu-
dents. For the second year she is
the coordinator for the Focus, a
limited pre-orientation program

for entering freshmen. For a
month in the summer, students
take English composition, math,
and speech courses and gain an
edge useful upon entering DC in
the fall. Miller is also active with
the RACE committee and the
Task Force on Racial and Ethnic
Concerns. As a related project,
she is working on the formation of
a black professional liason group
to provide a useful network for
students. Miller has also helped
coordinate a tutoring program
having its center in the dean of stu-
dents office. Students who need
help in their work can come to the
dean’s office and find the proper

thropology.

He also has several plans for
the Department of Anthropology
and Sociology. He said, “Our de-
partment is beginning to rethink
the definition of our major.” He
continued, “You will see changes
in next year’s catalogue.” New
professors are also under discus-
sion.

Jones specializes in an area of
anthropology called
Mesoamerica. This area includes
Mexico and Northern Central
America. His primary interest in
this area is the Maya Indians. He
has spent several years studying
them in the country of Belize on
the Carribian coast of Central
America. He has also done field
work in archeology. At the pre-
sent he is working on the history
of the Maya Indians under
Spanish Colonialism.

Jones is originally from
Florida, where he attended
Florida State University. He
began studying music and later
switched to anthropology. He
graduated cum laude with a B.A.
in 1963. In 1967 he received his
Master’s degree, and in 1969 he
received his doctoral degree both
from Brandeis University in Mas-
sechusetts.

Jones became a member of the
faculty at Hamilton College in
Clinton, New York in 1968 and
remained there until 1985. He was
chairman of the Department of
Anthropology from 1968-80 and
again from 1983-85.
