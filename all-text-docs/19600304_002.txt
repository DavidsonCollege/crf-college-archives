Comprehensives: A Davidson Need

Education is not a hop-scotch af:
fair. It is a process.

It is not the memorizing of partic-
ular subjects for one semester and
then forgetting them. It is a unity
of learning.

At Davidson we often fall into
the fallacy of making our education
a one semester affair. We memorize
for a grade and then forget.

t
THE DAVIDSONIAN ‘wishes to
propose what we think will help to
make a Davidson education a learn-
ing process instead of an advanced
course in memorization—comprehen-
sive examinations.

The idea of comprehensives is that
a student, in the spring of his senior
year, will take an exam covering his
major field. His graduation and his
final standing would depend on the
outcome of the exam.

Knowing that he will be required
to take such an exam at the end of his
senior year, a student would be moti-
vated to master the material present-
ed to him instead of just grasping it
long enough to spout it back on a
review or semester exam.

The idea is practiced at many of
the better colleges in the nation. Re-
ports from these schools acclaim it
as highly successful.

William C. .DeVane, dean of stu-
dents at Yale where comprehensives
are a part of the academic program,
comments that they encourage the
student, “‘to pull the knowledge of his
major field together and solidify his
understanding of it.”

THE DAVIDSONIAN therefore
proposes the following:

Sophomore Rush:

The clash of the old and the new
—freshman rush and sophomore rush
—is fast coming to a showdown. In
the absence of organized reasons one
way or the other, we offer what we
hope to be an objective analysis of the
situation and the factors at stake.

On the one hand, a sophomore
rush system would have the following
effects:

1. It would give incoming fresh-
men a full year instead of a short
week to appraise college life, aca-
demic and social. A man who
pledges after examining the system
for a year is more likely to be an
enthusiastic member, one who joins
a fraternity because he thinks that
it is best for him. The ones who do
not join will increase the indepen-
dent group and provide more stim-
ulus and competition for the fra-
ternities.

2. A year of mutual examination
will vastly increase the chances that a
‘sophomore and the fraternity who
pledges him will both have a more
accurate idea of what each is getting.

3. Freshmen seeking a common
group will develop class spirit, and
there will be more healthy interclass
competition.

4. The absence of compulsory
fraternity activities in ene’s fresh-
man year will provide more oppor-
tunity for him to become a part of
valuable extra-curricular activities,
such as drama and debate.

5. The fraternities will seek to
provide a better impression as a
group; over the course of a year, this

1. That a system of comprehen-
sive examinations be initiated at
Davidson, starting in the departments
that already have honors work and
which would be better prepared to
administer such an exam.

2. That a student be required to
pass the examination before he can
graduate. The standards of the test
should be set reasonably high so the
exam will become a climax to one’s
college career and not merely routine.

3. That an outside board of exam-
iners be called in to administer the
exams. This would not only motivate
the student to master areas in his
major field not stressed in classroom
work, but would also keep the faculty
on its toes.

The matter of senior theses is
often discussed along with compre-
hensives. Opinion on such a paper
varies.

Many have found it successful. To.
quote Dean DeVane again, “It (a
senior thesis) is a maturing instru-
ment of great educational value.”
However, others feel that the value
of such a program at-the college level
is- doubtful and does not justify the
amount of time spent on it.

We feel that at the present theses
should not be required of all students,
but only of those advanced students
in honors work where the department
deems such a paper valuable. This is
done in several departments at pres-
ent.

With this as a start, perhaps the
educational system at Davidson will
advance to a level where such a paper
for all students will be considered
feasible.—J.H.

Pro And Con

will result in a better fraternity and
a better system.

On the other hand, sophomore
rush may provide the following ad-
verse effects:

1. Freshmen who find it diffi-
cult to adjust to college life will no
longer have a big brother or a
housemother to counsel them.

2. Many men, during four years at
college, find fraternity membership
quite valuable and meaningful. Why
deprive him of one-fourth of this ex-
perience?

3. The contact between seniors
and freshen will lessen. Seniors
will be too busy with their activities
to make a conscious effort to know
the freshmen, but the latter often
find the relationship to be an inspira-
tional one.

4. A redefinition of “dirty rush-
ing” will be necessary. Sophomore
rush might conceivably turn into
a year-long Rush Week.

5. Since freshmen will have a year
to pick out the fraternity of their
choice, the problem of increased
homogeniety in fraternities may be-
come more acute.

The Interfraternity Council will
make the decision in a few weeks. We
hope that every student will spend
some thought on the problem, for it
is only by an unselfish examination
of motives that the value of the fra-
ternity system be increased.

THE DAVIDSONIAN will offer
editorial comments on the problem in
next week’s issue.

Dear Sir:

It seems lamentable to me
that Davidson has many of what
psychologists may call frustrat-
ed students. It seems even more
lamentable that she has among
her faculty one of a rare spo-
cies, a frustrated professor; and
one at that, who is frustrated by
the power of those big, bad
Greek letter fraternities.

One might conceivably
wonder why. It could be be-
cause he was never in one,
or because he hasn’t been of-
fered en honorary member.
ship, or because he thinks
they are sapping the intetlec-
tual strength of his students.

This frustration could oe, too,
because he is afraid of them,
or jealous of them, or even
because he hasn’t been able to

make his “influence” felt with-
in their midst.

Whatever the reason, he is
frustrated.

The shame of the matter is
that this disturbance is
spreading among his disci-
ples, and they, too, sre be-

coming frustrated.

His freshmen are having the
knowledge, for which they are
paying dear life to try to get,
denied them while they are sub-
jected to expostulations against
the fraternity system by his
friends.

All in eff it seems rather
ridleulous to me.

The situation has, however,
given Davidson something she
didn't have before — a rebel
without a cause. Poor thing.

To The Student Body
Dear Friends:

I received in today’s mail a
fine letter from Lt. Col. Wil-
liam L. Adams, Jr. of your Dav-
idson College, together with a
Bank Draft for $3,300.00.

1 understand this is the re-
sult of your Annual Christ-
mas Gift Fund Drive, and thet
it is to be used for The

Bangkok Christian Hospital.

In the name of the hospital, I
wish to acknowledge receipt of

sharing on your part.

We realize the sacrificial giv-
ing that went into this gift, and
we know you will be fichly re-
warded for caring for people
on the other side of the world
from you.

As we understand the ob.
ject of your gift, we heve
used your gift to order and
purchase ® new operating
room table for a new operat-
ing room building that will
soon be built for our hospital.

The cost of the new table
comes to approximately $2,700.
With the rest, we will order a
new operating light, thus com-
pleting one unit.

We will place a plaque on
each, stating that these are the
gift of the Student Body of
Davidson College.

Thus, you can think thet
each time this unit is used—
and that may well be several
times a day—that you heve

a part in healing the bodies -

of people in Thailand.

I also want to thank Lt. Col.
Adams for his share in this gift,

“A SESSION EVERY NIGHT”

Colviz: ge

ligious Jazz Gives

Sense Gf Awe, Wonder, Humility

By TOMIAY COLVIN
Davidsonian Feature Ediisr

During the past five year
there has develoned a wide-
spread interest in the relation-
ship of religion and jazz.

This interest reached its high
point only two weeks ago when
the Contemporary Jazz Ensem-
ble appeared on the hour-long
“World Wide 60,” a new tele-
vision series produced by NBC.

WESLEY IN JAZZ

The jaz ensemble presented
Ed Summerlin’s jazz setting of
the Wesley Morning Orders of
Prayer, a work that has been
receiving nation-wide attention.

This approach to religion
through jazz is startling to most
people, yet ‘many have also
found something of value here.
This week’s Christlan Century
states: “We can expect the old
reliables who disapprove of
everything to whell out the old
epithets and shout blasphemy.
They can easily be dismissed:
the communion of saints is bet-
ter served by those who let the
Spirit blow as He wills.”

SPIRITUAL ORIGINS

Actually, there is nothing
new in the realization that
there may be some relationship
between religion and jazz. The
roots of jazz are firmly en-
trenched in the religious music
of the Negro of the late 1800's.

Much of jazz is taken directly

from the old spirituals. In fact,
in 1938 a Carnegie Hall concert
entitled “From Spirituals to
Swing” met with great success
and inierest. And morc recent-

Jy. Sunday is “spiritual day” at

the Newport Jazz Festival.
SATCHMO LIKES IT

Several weeks ago I talked at
length with Louis Armstrong
about religion and jaz. He
braced my convictions by an-
nouncing, “Religion and jnzz
have always been together.
They belong together.”

On another occasion Satch
was reportedly asked if he was
interested in religidn and God,
to which he replied, “He and I
‘has a session every night.”

POPE LIKES I(T

Even the Catholic Church is
seriously interested in this sub-
ject. There are many prominent
jazz critics who are “higher-
ups” in the Catholic hierarchy.
And recently, even the Pope
has come out in favor of relig-
fous jazz (bless his soul).

The case for religious : jazz
has been well summed up by
the Rev. Al Kershaw, who
achieved wide fame by winning
$32,000 by answering questions
on jazz on “The $64,000 Ques-
tion.”

KERSHAW LIKES IT

“While it (jazz) came from
the Negro, it spoke to the feel-
ings of human beings every-

aS HAPPENING
THE WAY IT DID BEFORE

where. Human beings might be
different in where they live,
what kind of home and job
they have, and how they are
treated, but if they are senst-
tive persons, there is a common
response to sorrow and to joy,
to death and to birth, to injury
and to happiness. Jazz became
an anthem of the brotherhood
of_sensitive men.

‘DEEP MEANING

“I would say simply that jazz
has deep religious meaning for
the following reasons:

1. Jazz helps us be sensitive
to the whole range of existence.
Far from offering us rose-color-
ed glasses to distort the reality
of life as sweetness and light, it
realistically speaks of sorrow
and pain, as well as of joy and
delight.

“AWE, WONDER”

2. Jaz gives us a sense of
awe, wonder, and humility at
the depth of agony and height
of majesty which life presents.

3. Jazz stimulates us to feel
deeply ahd truthfally. It helps
us to know who we are, persons
who do feel deeply. It frees us
to accept our feelings and to
value the understanding that
they provide.

4. Jazz, in opening to the
depths of feeling, opens to us
also the understanding of our
dependence upon a Providence
beyond us, not of our owa mak-
ing.”

Bangkok Christian Hospital.

It was his loving interest and
concern for a small Thai boy
that started his interest in our
hospital. Thus, if it hadn't been
for him, in the Providence of
God, this gift wouldn't have
been possible at this time.

1 also wish to comment that
the executive secretary of our
mission in Trailand, known es
the Commission Represente-
tive, is a graduate of David-
son, and a classmate of your

May I again thank each one

Dear Editor:

For several years I have been
an interested reader of THE
DAVIDSONIAN. I have been
‘yuite surprised at the reversal
of editorial opinion since the
beginning of the second semes-
ter. As the wife and mother of
Davidson graduates, I want to
express what I think about in-

From Bangkok, Charlotte, And D. C.

tegration at Davidson College.
it is easy to confuse relig-
lous fanaticism with Christ-
lenty. | cannot think it is eo
Christion “must” fo admit
Negro students to e small
private college, and | cannot
think of any adventeges that
the college itself would de-
rive from their admittance.

It would seem to me that the-
acceptance of the few who
would be qualified would not
outweigh the problem|s in-
volved. And may | timidly sub-
mit that it is possible for an
act to be Christian, yet unwise.

For example, it would be
Christien for a woman slone

in her cer to be a good Se
meritan and offer a lift to
en unknown men apparently
in distress. Yet it would be
an exceedingly foolish thing
to do.

Davidson appeals to me be-
cause it is a small college
whose students come from the
same general background and
culture. Isn't that fact essential
for happy association and life-
long friendships?

TOIL AND TROUBLE

Tn True Calvinist

Ire, 1 Submit.

BY JOHN STONE

it
eo e¢ 8

There is a distinct factor which distinguishes David-
son College from many other institutions of higher
learning. This is the relationship of the College to the

Church.

One of the stated aims of education here is that
the spiritual growth of the individual should not be
neglected along with his intellectual growth.

To this end, therefore, the College has provided for
both religious instruction and corporate worship in the
life of the students and has encouraged other voluntary
organizations such as the YMCA and the various church-

related fellowships.

The students sometimes do not, in what ma

be

their somewhat natural perversity, appreciate these
attempts, exhibiting upon occasion conduct which is in
violation of good manners and proper respect; they
disregard the rights of others.

Of course, in true Calvinist ire, I submit that such
actions are destined to bring down the wrath of God
on the head of the offender.

The disruptive aspects of this misbehavior are, in
my opinion, of only secondary importance in view of
the fact that it causes those students who choose to take
their God seriously to seek- religious expression else-
where, sometimes outside the Church.

1 do not mean that misconduct in vespers and
chapel alone are responsible; it is, rather, a prevailing
atmosphere of anti-religious and anti-intellectual feel-

ings that are at fault.

These forces then turn in fidicule-upon the Thing
which they have created; they ought instead to first

remove the cause and then
tion might be rectified.

1 do not wish to seem

the presently existing situa-

to be the apologist for that’

group of uncritical fundamentalists which holds cer-
tain unorthodox views, the group which has a some-
what questionable relationship with the Church and
conventional dogma. This group has, by its activities
created problems on campus which have caused grave
concern in high administrative circles.

But I do feel that one of the chief causes of the
chapel and Vespers behavior problem lies in the attitudes
and actions of the student body. 1 can see no valid

reason why these attitudes

and action should continue.

Martin Discusses
Vocational Symposium

By BILL MARTIN

“What do you do for a
living?”

All of us will eventually be
asked this question. Will doing
something for a living be a
fair estimate of what our jobs
mean to us? Each of us pro-
fesses a system of values, even
ff it’s only “me first.” Our
daily work, to be meaningful
and effective to us as individ:
vals, must express our highest
values,

For the Christian, the diffi-
culty in expressing his highest
value in his job les in the
thorough secularization of daily
life. The concepts of work and
vocation have become divorced
in our minds. Our jobs seem

to have no relation to our spirit-
ual values.

It is the purpose of the
YMCA Symposium on Vocation
to present this problem to the
student in the form of the fol-
lowing four questions for the
individual:

1) What is the highest value
I profess?

2) How, if in any way, do I
or will I serve this value in my
chosen vocation?

3) Is there a conflict between
the value I profess and the
practices I must follow in order
to be effective in my vocation?

4) How do I resolve the con-
flict; or if I cannot resolve it,
can I choose between my values
and effectivcness in my voca-
tion and still make my life
really count?

During the week of March
6-11 these four questions will
be faced by men from the fields
of business, politics and law,
and science.

The YMCA hopes that each
student on the Davidson cam-
pus will lend his support to the
Symposium by participating in
the program in vespers, chapel,
and in scheduled informal dis-
cussion with the speakers.
