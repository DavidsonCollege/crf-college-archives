Local Entrepreneurs Obtain
Tuxedo Business, Begin Sale

By TOM BRUCE
Contributing Editor

Sophomore Jack Wilson sees
new possibilities for the free en-
terprise system in his campus
tuxedo bonanza, a cautious ven-
ture that may reaffirm David-
son as the land of opportunity.

In a surprising series of moves
last week, Wilson acquired the
entire stock of Charlotte’s Ben
Tuble Tuxedo Rentals.

‘‘We carted off about 40 tux
and 78 dinner jackets plus about
150 shirts, hundreds of cumber-
bunds and literally thousands of
suspenders and studs,” Wilson
said. ‘

The sale was initiated by
Laundry Manager C. W. Stacks,
in a meeting at the Charlotte
Health Spa.

‘‘Mr. Stacks was lounging in
the sauna when he started talk-
ing with a probate accountant
at the Spa. The accountant said
that Mr. Tuble was in a deep
coma, not expected to recover,
and that he wanted to dispose
of his stock right away.

“Mr. Stacks said that he
might be interested, and he ask-
ed me to act as a sort of mer-
chansider,” Wilson said. “I
agreed and Mr. Stacks decided
to close the deal.

“By the‘time Mr. Stacks saw
the accountant, Mr. Tuble had
died, so we just bought out ev-
thing,” he said.

‘Everything’ includes several
tubular racks, years of business
records, a fat quantity of per-
sonal correspondence, Mrs. Tu-
ble’s ancient family Bible, and
of course the clothes.

Wilson has set up a rather in-
timate salon in his room in Belk
dormitory. At any given time,
there are two or three students
gathered there waiting to romp
through Wilson’s extensive col-
lection of sizes.

Wilson said that because he
had gotten a good bargain with

the probate officials, he was
selling the full tuxedos for $15,
which is about 75% of the typ-
ical rental charge for one night’s
use.

“The white dinner jackets are
going for $10, or with the com-
plete accessories, $15,” Wilson
said. “I had about 12 buyers
during the first weekend of
sales.”

Wilson declined to say how
much Stacks had paid for the
wares, but he admitted that
they would make a decent prof-
it if they wetfe able to sell all
the outfits.

‘‘We might have some trouble
with some of the odd pieces,”

The student senate this week
endorsed a proposal which call-
ed for the location of the SGA
and DAVIDSONIAN offices in
the basement of Chambers, be-
ginning in the fall of 1972.

The proposal, written in the
form of a letter to the president
drafted by Student Body Presi-
dent Ralph Peeples and DA-
VIDSONIAN Editor Rich Wil-
son, expressed the need for the
offices of these two organiza-
tions to be centrally located in
relation to the rest of the cam-
pus.

Peeples and Wilson felt that
the Jackson Court site for their
offices which was proposed in
the Union report was too far
away from the center of activ-
ity.

The student leaders also felt
that it was essential that the

Wilson observed, ‘‘and then

he said.

Down at the College Laundry
there is a lot of speculation
about the enterprise. A lighted

register reads ‘‘Think Formal

Sophomore Jimmy Shepherd,
tending the revolving clothes
rack, stated, ‘‘Mr. Stacks had
Jack in mind from the first. He
has all the qualities of a good
salesman. He’s stubborn, very
forceful, and quite aggressive.”

‘‘He’s a real pusher for what
he believes in,’ chimed in Mrs.

offices of their respective or-
ganizations be located near
each other, since their func-
tions are interrelated.

However, much of this week's
meeting was devoted to what
Peeples called ‘‘house-cleaning
business’, that is, the swearing
in of new senate members and
the nominations for various fac-
ulty committees.

New senators sworn in Tues-
day were rising juniors John
Knox and Whit Witworth and

committee appointments includ-
ed rising senior Steve Suflas
and rising sophomore Peter Al-
ford to the Committee on Ath-
letics, rising sophomore Rowan
Crews and rising junior Bo Phil-
lips to the Committee on Coun-
seling and Guidance, rising jun-
iors John Douglas and Tom
loanes to the Committee on Li-
brary Planning and rising jun-
ior Dan Thorn to the Library
Committee.

Also at the meeting Mike
Scott submitted a proposal ask

ing for $30 from the Senate to
order and distribute coeduca-
tion buttons. This proposal trig-
gered a rather complex senatc
battle which ultimately led to a
discussion of the right of Scott's
committee to exist and of just
where the SGA’s_ repsonsibili
ties lie.

The outcome of this was the
atknowledgement of the com-
mittee’s purpose, namely to
publicize the coeducation issue,
and the awarding of $60 instead
of $30 for the buttons.

Slater Service To Relocate

In Three Court Eating Clubs

By BRUCE MALOY
Staff Writer

The demolition of the College
Union building this summer
means that the eating clubs on
Patterson Court will have a new
neighbor next year.

ARA Slater food service will
be moving its operations to
three houses on the court, ac-
cording to unit manager Ron
Scott.

One house will be a snack bar
—modified cafeteria. The cafe-
teria will serve breakfast, lunch,
and dinner while the snack bar
will be open during the day and
evening. The exact hours for the
snack bar have not yet been
determined. —

Since this house will be simi-
lar to the cafeteria-snack bar
towards the front of the Union,
it is possible that present snack
bar will be open later this year
to determine the most popular
hours.

Another of the Slater houses
will be a delicatessen-modified
cafeteria. The delicatessen will
have all sorts of sandwiches,
sliced meats, and a pickle bar-
rel as well as a charcoal grill
for premium items such as
steaks.

The third house is planned as
a buffeteria to be set up along
the same lines as the present
Sunday buffet. Students will be
able to get all they can eat for

a set price.

“Next year the board plan
will be based on coupon book-
lets which will be the same as
money,” said Scott. ‘‘The stu-
dents can buy a coupon booklet
for the year which will be di-
vided into weekly segments.”

Scott pointed out that under
this plan students who do not
eat breakfast or who are gone
on the weekend will not be pay-
ing for meals that they don’t
eat.

“T don’t think that people who
eat three meals a day will suf-
fer, since they usually eat less
at each meal than people who
eat only one or two meals a
day,” he said. ‘‘This has been
our experience in other ARA
Slater units.”

When asked which facility he
preferred as far as food service
is concerned, Scott answered, ‘I
prefer the three houses over the
present facility since this will
allow us to give more variety
and higher quality in the food
service.”

One problem of moving the
food services is that there are
only two vacant houses on Pat-
terson Court and ARA Slater
must have three houses. Unless
two of the houses merge on
their own, a house to be vacat-
ed will have to be chosen. Dean
of Students Will Terry outlined
the factors which will be con-

sidered if one house has to be
singled out:
1. Standards of food service;
2. Fiscal responsibility;
3. Condition of
ings;

the furnish-

4. Care and handling of the
house;

uo

. Co-operation with other
houses and the system;

6. Internal cohesion;

. Stability of membership
(fluctuation in the number
of members).

~~]

“Each house will be encour-
aged to write a brief saying why
they should remain on the court
and individuals from each house
will be asked to appear before
the Student Life Committee,
Terry said. ‘‘There will also be
a questionnaire to determine
freshman opinion of each house
on the basis of how each house
responded to them,” he said.

”

Members of eating clubs and
national fraternities who were
contacted held varied opinions
of what Slater’s move would
mean to them. Most felt that
two houses would merge, so
they weren't worried about
their own houses being evicted.

Emanon President Jim
Thompson helieves that the
proximity of the ARA Slater
houses to eating clubs will help
the freshmen to mix better than
they do now.
