THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS . MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1993

Stressed? Bored? Road trips may be solution to your problems

What did I do last weekend? I
piled into a van with seven other
people and drove about nine hours
to Baltimore to see my first Major

League Baseball game. Why?
Because it was fun.
When! wasin Wurzburg, Ger-

many last spring, I remember dis-
cussing with several students from
Davidson what we missed about
America and what we would im-
mediately see, do and eat upon
arrival. Several of my friends en-
visioned how much fun it would be
to take a road trip once we were
back in America. Since two of the
guys involved in the conversation
were from Baltimore, they sug-
gested that we pilgrimage to
Camden Yards to see an Orioles
game. Since that sunny day in
May, I had never really given that
conversation much thought...until
two weeks ago, when they re-
minded me they had bought eight
tickets, and I was expected to ac-
‘company them. I suddenly real-
ized how different my “Davidson
mentality” is in comparison to my
“Europe travel mentality.” Since
we had initiated the plans while I
was still very accustomed to trav-
elling, it seemed very logical and
natural to travel on the weekends.
I have to admit, though, that last
week I felt hesitant and apprehen-
sive about the trip. Several thoughts
Starting bouncing around in my
brain: I have a paper due Monday,
300 pages of reading, and I know
I'll be literally attacking my alarm
clock next week when I hear that
annoying morning greeting. De-
spite my anxieties, my curiosity
and interest in the new and excit-
ing conquered my feelings that I
should stay at Davidson.

I won’t bore you and write a
travel log of my trip, but I would

like to share a few amusing anec--

dotes. To begin with, the over-
sized white Ford beauty of a van
was not exactly overloaded with
modern technology. In fact, itcame
offthe a line as I was being

delivered in the hospital —1972!
Two interesting tidbits about the
van: though we left all the win-
dows open during the entire trip,
the gas leak in the floor created a
small amount of tension and fear
for the passengers that we might
asphyxiate, and (2) since there were
no seats in this vehicle, we had to
improvise and recline on sofa cush-
ions. So far, I bet a lot of you are
cringing at our travel conditions.
In reality, it was hilarious. I felt
like I was participating in a nine
hour mobile party. Have you ever
seen people trying to dance when
they can only stand half way up?
(Come find me if you’d like to see
the proof on film).

Unfortunately, our trip was:

delayed due to a very innocent
blunderour driver made. Yousee,
though Steve is from Baltimore
and has driven on this interstate
many times, somehow, after we
stopped for a break, he entered the
highway going southbound, and
didn’t realize his mistake until he
saw a sign welcoming us back to
N.C.!!!! A couple of hours later I
had dozed off and was awaken by
the screams of little kids chasing
us and trying to tear our Orioles
decorations off the van. I’m still
not exactly sure what we were do-
ing in this random neighborhood
in Virginia, but my deduction is
that, yet again, someone made a
wrong tur. When we finally ar-

re:

rived in Baltimore, Tim Sobon
decided to hop out ata red light and
dance in the street to display his
pleasure that we had arrived safely.

That night we had an incred-
ible feast: “All You Can Eat” Mary-
landsteamed crabs, which like D.J.
had claimed, are worth the road

trip alone. One thing I learned last
year in Europe is how many inter-
esting people I could meet if I
would just make a little effort to
initiate a conversation. Everyone
seems to have a story worth hear-
ing. For instance, we met 60 year
old Bill, at our outside restaurant,
who showed me how he can rip off
the legs and strip open a crab in 30
seconds. (It took me at least 2
hours to accomplish what he could
in 12 minutes)!

At Camden Yards, I ended up
literally bumpinginto a friend from
home who Ihadn’t seen in 2 years.
He was going to a special party,
where one needed a ticket to enter
and partake in the free food and
drink. I then proceeded to sweet
talk Karl (the ticket taker) into
letting us sneak in, so that I could
visit with my friend. After finding
out that] was from Kentucky, Karl

my very soul.

At least psychiatrist Peter D.
Kramer, a staunch defender of
Prozac, wouldn’t seem to mind. I
stole the following quote from
Newsweek: “When one pill at
breakfast makes you a new per-
son,” writes Kramer,“ it’s difficult
toresist the...visceral certainty that

who people are is largely biologi-
cally determined.” To this, I an-
swer with a hardy flatulency of,
“Sowhat?” I don’tsee the idea that

m “biologically determined” by .

my parts (which is a strange para-
dox) as a valid reason to nuke my
neurocortex. Never mind that I
have learned so much from my
struggles, or never mind that there
isso much reason to feel bad about

our modem world. It has been
decided by our heroes and gods
that in our contemporary society
that the purpose of life is to be
happy. As far as I can tell, that
excludes love, remorse, melan-
choly, and many other ofourmuses.

I owe an old friend who com-
mitted suicide, a Leon Solomon,
many thanks for the following ad-
age: “Life is not a joke.”

belief hold uptosome scrutiny? If
what we hear in the classroom
makes us doubt, what will happen
when we leave Davidson and life
shoves those contradictions at us
without explanation? How will
we fare then?

An open mind and an open
heart are the best avenues to a
strong spirit. I can recall so many
conversations I’ve had, ‘standing
with folded arms and closed ears,
not even willing to acknowledge
even the possibility of my.

opponent’s beliefs having any
truth. But in a time of real despair,
I began to listen hard to what
people, professors and students
alike, had to say about other reli-
gions, or the lack thereof. Instead
of diving deeper into the turmoil of

faithless floundering, I. emerged

with direction and conviction, cen-
tered on what I know is the right

path for me. That was my first two .

years. With my time left, I intend
to adhere to that path and to help
others stay on theirs.

Moulding my faith has, I’ve
discovered, been the essence of

my education. I’ll go about my
Studies and complete my major
(hopefully) like everyone else, but
P’llleave here with something much
more important than just knowl-
edge. What I’ll leave here with
will sustain me forever, will help
me when my four years of facts
leave me stranded.

Davidson provides us with
many opportunities, but the most
important, I think, is the chance to
find out who we really are, and
where we stand in the universal

scheme of things. Once we know-

that, the rest is easy.

ing 15 years in the Lexington Fed-
eral Penitentiary for robbing abank.

Anyway, the game was really
enjoyable, and Larry, the very eld-
erly, helpful ticket man for our
section was tickled when we were
displayed waving our cheesy ESPN
banner on the tremendous fifty foot
wide scoreboard screen. I think
our enthusiastic behavior during
the game made his evening.

Except for the fact that I was
pretty tired, the ride home Sunday
night was alsoalotof fun. Through-
out the night, I tried to block out
the music and catch a few hours of
sleep. Iremember the driver ques-
tioning in alarm whether large
amounts of steam should be escap-
ing from the engine. We exited,
and somehow I stumbled out of the
van at 4:00 a.m. at a gas station
while the engine cooled down. I
remember hearing a very rough
looking woman police officer yell,
“Ts dat a ‘flamen?”

At around 8:30 a.m. I awoke
and saw people bouncing and
grooving to the great sounds of

Phish. I new why the adrenalin
had already started to flow quickly
through their veins — we were
almost home and we all had Mon-
day morning classes to attend.

Boy, have I been tired today;
but I still think it was worth it.
What I’m trying to say is that
Davidson can be a lot of fun, but it
is also very refreshing to get away.
My first two years of Davidson
seem to blur together. All I can
seem to remember are classes and
lots of beer at Patterson Court. I
know the court is a great place to
see people and socialize, but when
that begins to lose some appeal,
hop in a car, and explore some-
thing interesting in the area. Last
weekend I visited a city Ihad never
been to before, bonded with my
friends, met many interesting
people and enjoyed myselfas much
as any trip I took last year in Eu-
rope.

If you’re discontent or bored,
you really don’t have an excuse.
Get out and do something, and
discover the wealth and interesting
sights our country has to offer.

"Mr. Charlie" is an old term

per outwitted the rich landowner,
boss, or husband. The essence of
the story rests on the fact that the
overlord does not even know that
he has been made a fool of.

"One important result of this
indirect mode of operation is that
members of the dominant group
are denied an essential part of life-
-the opportunity to acquire self-
understanding through knowing
their impact on others.

"They are thus deprived of
‘consensual validation,’ feedback,
and a chance to correct their ac-

tions and expressions.

"Put simply, subordinates
won’t tell. For the same reasons,
the dominant group is deprived
also of valid knowledge about the
subordinates.”

The above explains our last
article a little better. The term Mr.
Charlie has been in existence for
Goddess knows how long, whites
just have not heard it. But every-
one has heard the word nigger.
And as for experience, until the
Davidson postmaster, certain stu-
dents and staff call you a nigger to
your face, you will never know our
experience.

the words “tired” and “starving.”
Our ascension to new paradigms
leaves others with less than a pair
o’ dimes. We whine about parking
spaces while they’re struggling for
sleeping spaces. We rest on pad-
ded couches as they’re cowering
in awkward crouches. They have
spent significant portions of their
lives (for what portion is insignifi-
cant) in pursuit of items and con-
cepts we consider trivial.

Oops, I hope I’m not disturb- -

ing your comfort! Even if we do

~ manage to pry our eyelids open,

we are generally incapable of em-
pathy. We may get a knot in our
stomach, but we wake up the next
morning fully recovered.

This is why the Inverse Com-
mittee invites you to join us No-
vember 7 for a very good (if not
always pleasant) night. We will be
spending the night acknowledging
the plight of the homeless and glo-
bally impoverished. We will be
sleeping in front of Chambers, not
inanalley. We will be surrounded
by friends, not strangers. We’ll be
safe and clothed, too, but more

_ importantly we will be much closer

comfort zone

to the denial of luxuries experi-
enced by impoverished persons,
and thereby, though we can’t un-
derstand, we’ll be forced to recog-
nized their struggles.

The homeless aren’t just lazy
bums, but rather the unfortunate
by-products of an impersonal soci-
etal machine. If every action has
an equal and opposite reaction, then
perhaps we can consider that the
same force which has propelled us
toward ease has knocked these
families and _ individuals
gloomward.

On November 7 we will ini-
tiate discussions and bring presen-
tations and introduce individuals
who don’t have the option of re-
turning to pre-arranged housing on
November 8. We don’t pretend to
solve problems by spending the
night on a well-kept lawn, but we
hope we are provoking thought,
compassion, and ultimately active
solutions.

I’m guessing you’ restill pretty
cozy, though, right? If you are the
slightest bit grateful for your com-
fort, meet beked thestepsofCham- _
bers.

Sincerely,

Ethan McCutcheon '97
