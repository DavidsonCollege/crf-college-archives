“NIGHTMARE ALLEY”.

A thrilling (?) story of carnival
life. The producers seem to be able
to work in a little bit of almost
everything in the course of the pic-
ture. This is not surprising since
Hollywood usually finds it hard to
stick to any one subject. They suc-
ceed in taking an ordinary carnival
barker all the way up and then all
the way down. He works his way
up and becomes the key man in a
mental telepathy act .Then he gets
connected with a woman who drives

him to drink,

“CRY WOLF”

Why worry, what you will see
in this picture? Either you have an
exam theynext day and wont’ be
théte or you don’t have an exam
the next day and will be at home.
Even if you do happen to wander
into the local theater, you will prob-
ably be thinking of more important
matters and won't be very interested
in the content of the picture.

“DEEP VALLEY”

Libby, a shy mountain girl with
a stammer in her speech, lives in
constant fear and frustration with
her parents im the rugged: Big Sur
mountains, south of Monterey in
California. Hate and suspicion domi-
nate the drab Saul Ranch and it is
a wretched existence for all, Mother
has feigned ilinessfor—years and
stays upstairs. Father vents his rage
and hatred on the barren soil. Over
this dilapidated farm hovers the
Big Sur and the wild beauty of the
coast,

Close by a road gang is pushing
a new highway through the rocky
country. Barker supervises the
shovel-gang and Barry, a tough
member of the outfit, is serving
