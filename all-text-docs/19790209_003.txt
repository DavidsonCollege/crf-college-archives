Complete text of
subcommittee report

The Professional Affairs
Committee requested us to “‘ad-
dress ...the following questions:
What was the intent andpurpose
of the original faculty action
authorizing self-scheduled ex-
aminations? What exceptions,
if any, were envisioned at that
time? What has been the extent
to which faculty members have
used the system since that
time? What other practices
have been used and to what
extent? What problems have
been experienced in the admini-
stration of self-scheduled exa-
minations? Ought _ self-
scheduled examinations to be
retained and why? How can ex-
amination practices be made
more uniform?

The subcommittee prepared a
“Questionnaire on Examination
Practice at Davidson” and dis-
tributed it to the entire faculty
last spring. A total of 66
responses were obtained by the
end of the term. There were 88
faculty actually teaching i in the
spring term.

A summary fo the informa-
tion obtained from the ques-
tionnaire follows: Of the 226
courses reported on, 41(182) did
not have a final examination, 19
(8.52) had a take-home exam,
18 scheduled the exam at a
single time, and 148 used
self-scheduled examinations. Of
those using the self-scheduled
examinations in 18 courses the
exams were distributed by the
professor and 130 were distribu-
ted by the distribution center.

Thirty-nine of the faculty
were of the opinion that the
honor system holds up well
during the exams, seven said
almost always, four didn’t
know, 11 worry about it and
only one dissented. Thirty-four
said the principal strengths
were flexibility for the student,
and about a dozen each cited
increased chance of honor viola-
tion, early preparation of exam,
and red tape as weaknesses.

The overall judgment was
that 29 liked, seven disliked,

and six can live with the system
hut 12 preferred scheduled
vxams. No more than two
faculty members favored the
same modification in the sys-

tem. No member of the faculty ©

requested an opportunity to
meet with the subcommittee to
present additional information
or opinion, although several
talked informally with individu-
al subcommittee members.

Additional information about
the use of the system was
obtained from the registrar,
who provided us with copies of
the report of the person in
charge of examination distribu-
tion.

Problems found in the admin-
istration of the self-scheduled
exams include: failure ofstudent
to get envelope to faculty on
time, failure of faculty to get
envelopes to distribution center
in time for suitable arrange-
ment, necessity for lots of
student help in distributing
large numbers of exams in a
short time, necessity of hiring
someone to supervise the distri-
bution, necessity. of maintain-
ing security both of untaken

and completed exams, difficul-
ties of getting the last few
students to return exams.

In other words, anything that
can go wrong, does. Still the
reports of smooth operation are
the rule.

In order to sample student
opinion each member of the
sub-committee telephoned eight

to ten students seleeted at |
random from.those students ©

with telephones listed in*the
college directory. Each student
was asked how well the honor
system seemed to work during

_ exams and whether self-sched-

uled exams were liked or dislike
and why. A couple of students
said that. they had heard occa-
sional rumors of cheating but all
the students indicated that they
believed that there was almost
no cheating. The:students were
unanimous in being strongly in
favor of self- scheduled examin-

ations.

A search of the Faculty
Minutes from 1969 to 1975
revealed the following about
self-scheduled exams:

A proposal for self-scheduled
exams was considered by the
faculty on January 21, 1969 and
rejected.

On October’ 6;--1969, Vice-
President Bevan presented a
self-scheduled exam program
from the EPC: The faculty
approved the program by a 2:1
margin for a two year experi-
mental period beginning with
the Winter Term, 1970-71. Quo-
ting from the minutes: “It is the
understanding of the faculty
that procedures...should be de-
vised by the Academic’ Vice-

President, Registrar, EPC, and _..

other faculty as elected by the
faculty or appointed by the
President.”

On March 23, 1971, Registrar
Burts reported that the self-
scheduled examinations had
worked well in the Winter
Term.

On June 1, 1971 the faculty
approved a revised statement of

- Academic Regulzitions ipon the”
‘recommendation of the EPC.

The Regulations include Section
IV entitled ‘‘Reviews and Exa-
minations.’” This section was

not revised but approved as it °

had been before.

There is no further mention of
self-scheduled exams through
Spring 1975.

Apparently we are still in the
experimental period for self-
scheduled exams since no record
could be found of additrional
faculty Rudy and approval. We
have no way of knowing what
the intent and purpose of the
original faculty action was, nor
can we find that any exceptions
were spelled out or intended at
that time. Our guide is therefore
the Academic Regulations.

The present academic regula-
tions on Examinations are the
same regulations that were in
effect before the self-scheduled
examinations first began in the

Winter Term of 1971. In June

1971, the entire academic regula-

tions were revised and approved
by the faculty but the section on

uled exams are not mentioned
but ‘scheduled examinations”

are (in paragraph IV-B-9).) It

was apparently felt that these
regulations were in keeping
with the spirit of self-scheduled
exams. We agree with this
concept and therefore interpret

‘the regulations as being appro-

priate to self.
scheduled exams.

Several faculty members
have suggested to the commit-
tee that we abolish the self-
scheduled exams and return to
scheduled exams. Considering
that a large majority of the
faculty appear to be in favor of
the self-scheduled method and
the students were unanimous in
their support of it we have
rejected that suggestion.

Several other faculty mem-
bers have suggested a ‘‘dual
system’’ under which each lec-
ture hour would be scheduled to
have an exam at a specified time
(9 AM or 2 PM as now) but
under which each professor
would decide for each course
whether the scheduled examina-
tion would be held or whether
self-scheduled exams would be
allowed in that particular
course.

This ‘possibility was discusses
but it was felt that the disad-
vantages of this dual system far
outweighed the advantages.
Therefore, we recommend that,
after our extended successful
trial, the faculty reaffirm its
approval of the _ self
approval of the self-scheduled
examination system with cer-
tain clarifications and modifica-
tions.
RECOMMENDATIONS:

A. The EPC recommends that
the faculty reaffirm its approval
of self-scheduled examinations.

B, The EPC recommends
that the faculty adopt the
following policy statements for
the administration of self-
scheduled examinations:.

“4. Am examination is

recommended for all courses for '

which exams are appropriate.
‘'i3@: All examinations are to
beligiven only on the days
designated as examinationdays.
That:is, not on the last day of
classes and not en the reading’

dayitiAny exception must be*
approved: by thedean of the :

Faculty. Any “review” sched-
uled: for more than’one hour in
the-last few days of: classes '-is

really’ an exam and therefore i is’

not allowed.

3. Faculty members are
authorized to distribute and
collect their own examinations
during the regular self-sched-
uled periods. Occasionally, a
colleague could perform this
task for the faculty member but
the primary responsibility
lie with the professor who
teaches the course.

4.The Dean of Students
office assumes responsibility for
collection and distribution of
the self-scheduled exams not
handled by the individualfaculty
members. (Effective SpringTerm
1979)

5. The Dean of the Faculty
is authorized to require that

7. The type of examination
should be clearly stated in the

8. The Dean of Students is
dirécted to add or modify rules
governing student conduct for
self-scheduled examinations so
that honor violations are dis-
couraged and honorable beha-
vior is-encouraged. Such rules
should be widely publicized-for
both faculty and students: For
example, the student might be
prohibited from studying ‘after
she or he has actually picked up
the examination, and studying
might be prohibited in examina-
tion areas during examination _

Faculty to request pay hike

By CHARLIE HAWKINS
Staff Writer.

When faculty representatives
meet with College Trustees
during the weekend of Feb. 23,
they are expected to ask for an
immediate ten percent wage
hike. Ady professors say they
feel: faculty salaries are so lwo
that they threaten the academic
quality of Davidson.

“It's critical already,’ com-
exander MKelway, President: of
the Davidson chapter of the
American Association of Uni
versity Professors.

“What we're pretty sure of its
that neither the ecministration
enough,” he added.

In a report to the ical’ the

AAUP claimed that current
salaries are 18 percent less than
in 1966-67 after being adjusted
for inflation. Academic Vice-
President Price Zimmermann
explained that the greatest
erosion of salaries occurred in
the mid 1970’s when the infla-
while. faculty salary increases
hovered around six percent.
“We're all: the victims of
inflation ‘and the failure of the
government to control infla-
tion,” said Zimmermann.
