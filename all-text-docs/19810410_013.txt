Freud and music: A tripartite discussion

1. Drums il. Guitar

| am the pulse, the mating thrust | am the clown prince

there is life in my heads, my shells, the flamboyant front man

“Nigger.” my shining cymbals the fame, the groupies— they are mine!
Our stomachs still turn. lam the anvil of my art ¢

Musty sandals and uncalloused feet fall into step.

Not knowing how to dress, we march

Brandishing our “HAIG IS A WAR CRIMINAL” signs, you try to deny my violence MN. Organ
Our pale skins reddening. nooooooo, baby—
But Consumer Rights, Alan Bakke and Afro Sheen to deny violence is to deny life

When Bach fed me, it was
“to the glory of God alone”
| have found God useful
for my purposes

commercials divert the camera's eyes.

In our world the poor earn seven thousand dollars

And can afford potato chips and Cadillacs,

Everyone’s best friends are black,

And Marxist equalit’s a Christian fad.

Mortgage rates and inflation afflict both black and white,
Only clouding the issue.

And we ;

Catch ourselves humming “You Light Up My Life.”

So we soak our feet, tired of Bob McNamara’s wasted tears and
Eldridge Cleaver’s black power.

Tired of a movement shortfused by too many leaders left unkilled.
Paralyzed, we now understand charity only hides
repression,

“Consciousness-raising” manipulates,

And the Peace Corps exports our great white hopes.
Sowesipourimported beer 92S
And turn to the sun and the atom to seek the first cause.
Rehearsing our song of solidarity.
