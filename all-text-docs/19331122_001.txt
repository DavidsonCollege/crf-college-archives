Dr. Lacy Concludes
Annual “Y” Services
With Talk Tonight

“Being a Man” Is General Topic
of Evangelical Program Start-
ing Sunday

ATTENDANCE IS LARGE

Speaker Is President of Union
Theological Seminary

Dr. Ben R. Lacy, president of Union
Theological Seminary, in Richmond,
Va., who was Chosen by the Y. M.
Cc. A. to conduct the fall evangelistic
services, concludes his series of inter-
esting and profitable talks to the Da-
vidson student, body tonight at 7:00
o'clock in Chambers Auditorium.

Dr. Lacy opened the services Sun-
day morning, November 19, when he
occupied Dr. Moffett’s pulpit at the
church service. His text was “The
Orthodoxy of the Devil,” and the
Sctipture reading was taken from the
entire second chapter of the Epistle
of James. The brilliant speaker began
his discourse by saying, “The devil has
an orthodoxy and knows that there
is a God, but this belief profits him
nothing. We, too, have an orthodoxy
and it is more valuable to us than any-
thing else. Creeds are the roots of
our lives and therefore are essentially
necessary in our life.”

The speaker then gave four charac-
teristics of an orthodox Christian: the
belief ni one God, the living of a
clean life, the giving to the fatherless
and the widowless, and the leading
of men and women to Jesus Christ.
He took each of these topics in turn
and showed how they were necessary
to a follower of Jesus Christ. The con-
vincing preacher concluded his sermon
by saying, “You can be orthodox like
the devil, or you can be orthodox in
divine love.”

“Being a Man” was the general
thought whieh Dr. Lacy developed at
“Y” vespers Sunday night and contin-
ued during the meetings on Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday. “To be-
come a man,” Dr, Lacy stated, “you
must first have faith in God and in
His Kingdom. You must believe that
God is real and a personality, and you
should be conscious that He is near
you always. Set yourself to believe
in His Kingdom and that we can be
builded into the Kingdom of God.”

Schenck

Four officers of Davidson R. O. T. C.
unit were extended bids to member-

and Blade, national military fraternity,
on Saturday, November 18.

are considered for membership. In
addition, they must possess certain
other qualities which include honor,
obedience, courage, leadership, loyalty,

measured up to the requirements for
membership and there will be in the
near future a special parade to deco-
rate them with the pledge ribbon of
Scabbard and Blade.

These men have not only shown in-
terest in military work, but have also
taken part in other activities on the
campus. Captain Cochran is a mem-

probably be other bids issued later in
the school year.

in athletics, scholarship, and leadership. They are both members of
the football team, were recently elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and are
members of O. D. K., honorary leadership fraternity. W. M. Thomp-
son is the president of the Davidson Y. M. C. A., and his brother,
W. T. Thompson, is editor of the‘. Y” Handbook. They are both ac-

the first period and again in the third.

The game was inaugurated by a bril-

line and weaved his way through the
Indian tribe for a 70-yard run to place
the ball on the Braves’ 25-yard line.
Two runs by Wingfield and a pass by
Mackorell to Wingfield put the ball on
the Indians’ 10-yard stripe.

A penalty inflicted on W. & M. put
