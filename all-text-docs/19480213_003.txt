'CAT TALES

By MAC HART

The Wildeats took a cue from that Yankee weather man
we got und put over a snow job on South Carolina’s Game-
cocks last Tuesday night in Charlotte, Their 25-point edge
cume as j surprise to everybody except the ’Cats who had
their eyes on bigger things—in Durham. Not only was it sweet
revenge for the 15-point drubbittg the Gamecocks gave us on
their home court, but it put us right in line for a tournament
bid. We now hold a better than .500 average in conference
play and it will not be diffieult to keep things that way from
here on out. We have six conferetice meets lett, and can count
on at least four of them to help on the Durham Road, Clem-
son is already behind us once bya 60-44 count and should not
have proved too difficult for the “ats iast night. We might
even mess around and beat UNC’s Tar Heels when they come
come to Charlotte the 24th.

Our victory over the Gamecocks is just one example to
show. What an important cog Mike Williams is in the Wild-
cat engine. Nobody doubted that his absence with a sprained
ankle in the earlier South Carolina fray could account for the
15 points between us and a win. There was a 45-point dif-
ference in the two scores this time. Of course, the Gamecocks
were off. It was their lowest score of the season, and not even
Carolina beat them that bad. Then too, the ’Cats were hitting
on all cylinders. They couldn’t miss. They were especially
deadly from the foul line, a department they have been weak
in here lately. ;

South Carolina’s Coach Frank Johnson called Mike and
Buddy ‘fas fine a pair of basketball players as there are
in the conference.’’ We already knew this, but it makes us
feel good to hear it from worthy opponents. Well might the
Gamecock mentor compliment this pair, for the ’Cats held his
two giant centers—Al Adams, 6’ 6’' and Jimmy Slaughter,
6 9’’—well out of the scoring. Al rated All-Conference center
last year at Raleigh, and his understudy Slaughter is no
novice.

With just two weeks left in the season, it will be interest-
ing to see if Cheek will maintain his scoring lead in the, big
three. As of the South Carolina game, he has a total of 223
points. Whit Js 80 points behind him with 193. Mike, with
about a seven-game handicap because of two sprained ankles,
has 183, but is climbing steadily. At twenty points a clip, he
may give Buddy a race for the lead yet.

Mid-Winters brought a lot of new faces and ‘‘new looks’’
to the campus, but none so permanent and so good-natured
as that of Ray Brown, Caoch Charlie’s new backfield assistant.
Ray arrived on the Davidson seene Monday, and is expecting
his wife and 1l-month-old daughter, Georgia, any day now.
Ray is a recent gridiron ace at Virginia, He also tried his hand

at baseball, track and basketball, and will help Coach Whittle

with the track team this spring.

After a long rivalry with Coach Charlie, Ray says, he got
tired .of getting beat, und decided to join up with his former
opponent. He played against Coach Jamerson’s high school
teams in Memphis, and again at Virginia, he butted heads
with the Tar Heels when Coach Charlie was.on the Carolina
staff. If you can’t beat ‘em, join ’em, as the man says, We
want to take this opportunity to weleome Ray and his family
to Davidson.

Snow does lots of thinks to basketball games and players.
The following incident, taken from the Charlotte News, shows
that our neighbor Catawba has got some of that old school
spirit that we sometimes think is exclusive with Davidson, It
seeems that Catawhba’s basektball outfit headed out through
the snow for Newberry, 8. C., to play the college by the same
name, They were traveling in two cars, but one of them
couldn’t make it through the drifts and had to turn back to
Salisbury. The remaining members of the team were un--
daunted, however, when they discovered that they were left
with only five men to play the game, They went ahead and
touk the court and made a creditable showing until new
troubles developed. :

One of the five fouled out, and it seemed that they really
were on the spot. The Catawbans were still undaunted, though.
They hurriedly slapped some togs on their manager and went
on to a 60-43 win over the. South Carolinians, This is worthy
of avhand, at least, from the authors of the Wildcat spirit.

Matmen Lose To
State, Carolina

The Davidson matmen seemed to
run true to form in both their
Southern Conference matches on
the home mats last week. Meeting
both the Tar Heels from Carolina
and the Wolfpack from State, the
‘Cats went. down to overwhelming
defeat by the respective scores of
24-3 and 29-3. In both matches the
able grappling of Kannapolis's Jim-
my Jung was the only highlight of
otherwise bad days for the wearers
of the Red and Black. Jung ac-
counted for all-our combined two
match total of 6 points by gaining
decisions over Wilson of Carolina
and Morgan of State In both
matches, incidentally, Jung came

within a hairs breadth of pinning
his man.

The bout with State before a
large Midwinter Dance audience

marked the appearance of a new
"Cat grappler, and the reappearance
of an old ‘Cat standby. Jack Bar-
nard, husky 175-pounder, took the
place of Bill Moore who. suffered
@ recurrence of an old service knee
injury in the Auburn match, and
Bill Fesperman the

wrestling wars after several weeks
layoff with a bad neck injury, Both
these ‘Cats, although suffering de-
feats, turned in noteworthy per-
formances, Fesperman grappled in
a thrilling nine-minute, duel with
Smith, in which the State matter
came out on top only “by the nar:
towest of margins, 7-6. Barnard,
likewise, turned in a_ scintillating
performance, as he gave the State
football star, Wagoner, more than
he had bargained for. State’s other
claim to football fame who per-
formed on the mats, was Charlie
Musser, who met and defeated
“Bull” Alexander in the unlimited
class. Alexander turned in a spark-
ling performance and almost tarned
the tables on the State gridiron
great.

returned to

After Jimmy Jung had won a
hard fought decision over Wilson in
the 121-pound class, the ‘Cats fell
down and lost the remaining seven
matches successively. Jung had al-
most pinned his opponent on three
occasions, when the period buzzer
sounded, and it was fortunate for
weary Wilson who limped to the

‘Carolina bench after nine minutes

of Jung's manipulating and ma-
neuvering. The Kemp twins, Lem
and Phil proved to be too much for
the ‘Cats to handle as they pinned
two. reliable ‘Catmen. Lem turned
the tables on “Bull Alexander” in
the spectacular time of 0.53 of the
first period, while Phil pinned Grif-
fith in 2:58 of the same period.
Mott Stubby Evans and
Chuck Kirby were decisioned by

Price,

Wingate Downs
Wildkitten Five .

The Jayvees were defeated 60-
49 Tuesday night by the Wingate
Junior College five in a somewhat
less impressive game thar the fol-
lowing Wildcat game. Big John
Shannon led the Wingate attack
an@ racked up 25 of the 60 Win-
gate points. The big center droppeé
them in with the greatest of ease
and couldn't be stopped. Davidson's
Ed Hopper took top honors with
11 tallies; Neisler and Brinegar fol-
lowed with eight each, Bo Roddey
scored seven for the Jayvees, three
for. the Wildcat team. Dutch
Hengeveld and Ed Hopper also saw
action with the varsity team in the
South Carolina encounter.

The next Jayvee game will take
place Saturday night at seven
o'clock in the “New Gym.” The Kit-
tens meet the Phifer Junior Col-
lege five before the varsity-Citadel
game

Carolina’s Gunton, Fisher and
Thompson in matches that could
have gone either way. In the un-
limited class, the Davidsonians ran
into some, tough luck when Bill
Moore, the Blacky, Kentucky ex-
marine, had to default his match
Bond after he was ahead on
points, 5-2, »

Valentine Day will prove to be
no day of rest for the weary ‘Cat
grapplers. They will travel to Dur-
nam to face the Blue Devils of
Duke University.
