Dramatic Club Holds
Trials For New Play

“Dover Road” Will Be Presented

by Masquers
Tryouts for the Red and Black
Masquers’ new production, “ Dover

Road,” were held Wednesday, April 18.

The original plan of the Masquers
was to produce Sheridan’s “The Ri-
vals,” but due to the length of the
play, the short time, and the number
of actors required, the choice of play
was changed to A. A. Milne’s “ Dover
Road.”

This change was not known until

the last moment, and the tryouts were

_ handicapped by the fact that the con-
testants were not familiar with the
play. However, the tryouts were a
success because of the large number
of contestants and the.new talent re-
vealed.

“Dover Road” is unusual in that
there is no one leading part, but all
the characters play important roles.
The character about which the play
centers is that of Latimer, played by
Nate Wauda, who performed in
“ Candida.”

The other characters are as follows:
Dominic—Dick Hillier; Nicholas—Billy
Higgins; Leonard—Stuart Henry; Eus-
tasia—Kalista Hood, and Ann—Adele
Arbuckle.

All the players except Hillier and
Higgins have participated in previous
Red and Black Masquers’ productions.
The play will be presented in approxi-
mately three weeks.

Fee for Senior Gowns

Must Be Paid Today

According to John Hunter, chairman
of the Senior Caps and Gowns Com-
mittee, the fee of $2.35 for these robes
must be paid by tonight at the latest.
This fee may be paid to any member
of the committee, consisting of John
Hunter, chairman, Joe Drake, and
Rawling Pratt-Thomas.

“Tt is absolutely essential that this
money be paid a tonce,” Hunter stated,
“as the gowns will not be sent until
a check is received for the full amount
by the company making the robes.”

The rest of the senior assessment,
$3.45, may be paid the latter part of
May. This assessment will pay for
the class gift, the senior class spon-
Sor’s picture in the Annual, and a senior
smoker.

Kimbrough and Goldiere Secure
Leave of Absence

Two prominent Davidson professors,
A. V. Goldiere of the French depart-
ment and J. T. Kimbrough of the math
department, will be away on a’ leave
of absence next year in order that
they make take up graduate study in
their respective subjects.

Professor Goldiere, who has taught
French at Davidson since 1922, first
entered college at Dartmouth, but dur-
ing his sophomore year at that school,
war with Germany caused him to en-
list in the A.E.F. However, he was
later assigned to the United States
Army Ambulance Service which served
as a part of the French army in Paris.
After serving from May until October,
1918, he was stationed with the tenth
French. army of occupation on the
Rhine. It was while serving in this
capacity that he was one of six se-
lected from his company to study
French at the University of Caen, in
order that a better spirit might be cre-
ated between the French and the
Americans.

After.the war, Professor Goldiere
returned'to Dartmouth, where he grad-
uated in 1920. Two years of post-grad-
uate work at Yale, where he studied
the Romance languages and majored
in French, followed. Professor Gol-
diere then began his work here at Da-
vidson, although he has taken summer
courses at the University of North
Carolina, University of Chicago, Sentro
de Estudios Historicos at Madrid, and
the French Institute at Penn State.
He acquired his Master of Arts degree
in 1928,

Professor Goldiere plans to teach at
summer school here this year and then
he will leave with Mrs. Goldiere for
New Haven, Conn., where he will work
for a degree of Doctor of Philosophy

Dr. Gwynn Optimistic Over Plac-
ing Applicants

Placement of Davidson students in
schools this year is rapidly being com-

fessor of education and chairman of

At the present time vacancies are to
be had for positions in high or prep
schools, teaching science and mathe-
matics, Spanish and German, or

received a vacancy for a high school
principal and a band director. These
positions have come from all over the
South.

To underclassmen who have in mind
teaching as a profession, Dr. Gwynn
points out several facts. First is that
more and more prep schools are de-
manding work in education courses as
a prerequisite for positions and that

invited to attend.

Soon

The 1934 graduating class will,
at its t, formally
present a gift to the school, The
class has decided to give either
