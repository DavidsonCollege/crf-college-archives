Letters To The Editor

Salvaged Honor Code Receives Support,
National Sanity Requires Nixon Ousting

To the Editer:

I am writing in regard to
Mr. Blakley’s column on the
honor system. This past
week's column is such a poor
piece of journalism that I
seriously question whether
Mr. Blakley should be given
the responsibility of writing a
column which merits space in
print.

Specifically, Mr. Blakley’s
statistics on cheating under
the honor code are blatant
fabrications which no thinking
person would use to sub-
stantiate his argument.

Since I was a_ transfer
student, I have been at David-
son only two years, but I have
always observed the honor
system to be_ working.
Someone who has attended
another college can rapidly
recognize the difference in
Davidson students, and the
fact that they do believe in
the honor code.

The honor system is cer-
tainly one of the unique ad-
vantages of Davidson College
which makes this a superior
school.

I do not deny that book theft
from the library is a problem,
but it is a problem that we as
students can handle, by
reminding others to check out
their library books. I have not
yet encountered any students
who were ripping off library
‘books

I doubt that few support Mr.
Blakley’s attitude or beliefs. I
hope and, in fact, feel certain
that Davidson students will
continue to value and uphold
the honor code.

To the Editor:

Please recommend to Mr.
Alan Blakley that he send a
copy of his column published
in the Jan. 18, 1974, DAVID-
SONIAN to some of the larger
research firms around the
country. Surely whatever
mysterious source Mr.
Blakley has access to for

Stout of

gathering his figures in the
areas of lying and cheating
would fascinate these firms as
much as it did me.

What: new math gave Mr.
Blakley the mystical figure
that told us,‘‘...if every guilty
person were taken to trial the
honor court would be in
session for the next 24 years
and seven months?”

And just how “his sources”

percent of the Davidson

hand, for then Mr. Blakley
would be in violation of the
honor code which he signed
before entering Davidson to
the effect that he would report
violations he
knowledge of.

Or could it be that he is one
of those found laughing at that

reminder? I hope he enjoys his
joke.
As to Mr. Blakley’s

statement that ‘‘considering
that the average Davidson
professor doesn’t read the
current literature in his field,
your basic plagiarist can and
does get away with anything,”
perhaps those professors un-
der whom Mr. Blakley has
studied should take note.
Meanwhile, I would be happy
to offer the names of some
professors whom I am _ sure
would be able to quickly
dispell this misconception.

It seems amazing to me that
anyone who has such a low
opinion of the honor system
has survived almost four
years at Davidson. Perhaps
some other members of the
senior class can work to bring
a new effort into the Davidson
community to salvage the
honor code which Mr. Blakley
has apparently abandoned.

I feel that I must write this
letter as a public expression

Proposed Calendar Leaves

Vacationing Turkeys Cold

I want to invite everyone to
go see “The Day of the

Turkey’’, a really great family
.Movie.

Second, did you know that
next year the average David-
son student (2.7) will not
receive a Thanksgiving
Vacation with his tuition?

Day, think of all the
that will be saved from amen
ciless death.

Now, take 3 ounces of
Bevaium sauce and baste a 2
pound Davidson yearling ; mix
until you smell a 4-1-4 rising,
and serve until your guests
think they taste turkey.

If that doesn’t satisfy your

of my concern for the
American nation. I sense the
continued development of a
sickness in this nation which is
led and exemplified by its
government.

This sickness of legalized
suppression a truth, legalized
injustice, the religious
~ this legalization has ob-
tained must find a cure or the
nation as the upholder of the
Deistic principles of the Con-
stitution and the Declaration
of Independence will become
like the regimes of Soviet
Russia and Chile.

They have ‘‘Watergate Af-
fairs’’ every day and they
always ‘forget about the
event of the past and get along
with the affairs at hand.’’ We
cannot do this and are not
doing this.

It is more evident to me
every day that for this nation
to return to health it is
necessary to impeach Richard
M. Nixon from the office of
President.

Then we can assess to what
degree this nation is dented

up.

I am not satisfied with the
silly pytty he is filling the
dents with now. It keeps drip-
ping out.

The only way to remove the
dents is to take a hammer and
pound them out.

To the Editor:

An acquaintance of mine
who is attending Davidson
took the liberty of mailing me

entary issue of
DAVIDSONIAN.”’
Specifically, the issue dated
January 1, 1984.

I must say, I was quite
amazed at this ‘‘publication.”’
As the initial shock wore off
and I wiped the tears from my
eyes, I allowed my roommate,
who resides in Charlotte, N.C.,
to gaze at your paper. He im-
mediately denied any past
knowledge of Davidson.

After everyone on our floor

appetite, toss out this prime
ingredient for family har-
mony.

Take all the money you
would normally spend on a

Dinner for 1,200 -

Thanksgiving

and now let it buy all the
hatred, lust, decadence,
debasement, corruption, and
war that it is worth.

When you have secured all
of the latter items, collect
them in a mixing bowl and
beat relentlessly until
liquified; spread evenly over
% of the western world (if you
want, heat at 450 degrees and
serve red hot).

Disregard the thought that
some families regard T-Day
as a day as sacred as Christ-
mas. No war and no hatred

had gaped at your features,
we all decided that “THE
DAVIDSONIAN’” is a raunchy
paper. Keep up the good work!
So, now you may truthfully
call your paper a ‘‘widely read
publication” (among various
other names). Rest assured
that we at Purdue hail your
efforts. But try a bit harder
next time, huh?

Two points for the 1974-75
Academic Calendar; personal
foul on the Davidson student
for thinking he was getting a
ving Day Vacation
next year. Bevan at the line
shooting until he makes one.

Good night. I’m going hom
to hide my Christmas vacation
under my collection of old
“Life’’ magazines. By the
way, “‘The Day of the Turkey”’
is rated ‘‘G’’. So let’s all go see

it as a group - all for one and
four one four, etc.

East Vets Relive
Uneventful Era

Someone had posted a sign
on the bathroom door saying
that the seniors who used to
live on this hall would be
coming up tonight for a party
and that everyone was invited
and to expect anything.

So by eight o’clock everyone
was standing by, waiting for
the explosion. Twenty leaders
back. together. Drinking beer
just like a few years ago,
shouting a person’s name
when they see him.

Bruce, my MEIUN. What do
you say? How are the old
burgers Bruce? How about a
quick Myers?

While most of the current
Fourth Sentelle crowd look at
what is taking place, only one
or two and a hall counselor
join in with the veterans.

Noone wants to talk about
new things, so talk goes back a
year, maybe three.

Seen Allport? Give me a
plate job, Kittrell. I heard An-
dy was coming back. Who

‘ called Iones?

Just because no one came
back, the reunion didn’t seem
any less important.

So you heard from med
school, huh? Tell the Phan-
tom.

_ Soon everyone remembered
what things were like, how the

hall looked and smelled. It had
the same feeling because the
same people were around.

But thinking about the years
in school made the changes in
everyone seem very clear.

So you figure every year
from now on will bring this
many changes, even though it
never seemed that way
before.

People who changed and
had watched your changing.
Yell at Cannon for a while.
Then somebody by and
smiles with pity at what’s
going on and leaves soon.

“Yeah, but: there’s never
been anyone around here like
us. We were together, man.
We really knew everybody.”

Somebody should get some

pictures. You just wait till
tomorrow, we'll beat West
Virginia.
And you write something.
Let everyone know about
Fourth East. Just make it fun-
ny, we don’t want anymore of
that bullshit.

The value of the year

Do something anyway.
Write about your friends.
Anybody got any pictures?
Some pictures of friends who
can see things that I do not,
and will let me write about

. them anyway, ....
