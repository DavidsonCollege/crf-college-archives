“If mental illnesses are recognized early
on, the illness can be treated effectively,” said
DeWitt Crosby, the Student Health Facility
Counselor. Crosby and Health Educator
Georgia Ringle have been working with the
student health advisors—Liz Bil-
let °04, Zoe McCoy ‘04, Rory
Adams ‘04 and Julia Philpott
*02—to coordinate Depression
Awareness Week. Running since
Monday, the educational week
will continue through Friday and
will include the National Depres-
sion Screening Program, fresh-
man hall programs, and a show-
ing of Good Will Hunting.

Fraternity placed on probation

while being president is that I’m powerless.”

He hopes that the punishment will change
the perspectives of the members of his house
as well as others on the Court.

“In a way, social probation could have
been easier on us. This [being dry] offers a
challenge to see if we can have arush without
alcohol. It’s a new direction for at least our
house.” ;

The ruling not only makes Kappa Sigma
ineligible to serve or have alcohol at any
function, but also keeps them from sponsor-
ing any party or function at other houses that
serve alcohol. .

So far, though, the fraternity has not had to
cancel any planned activities, said West, who
feels that it is important to stay on course as
much as possible. The house will, however,
have to change strategies and activities
planned for rush season and pledging.

“We’re going to have to find other sources
of fun,” said West. “It’s a challenge to see if
we can be responsible enough.”

Other members of the Court also accepted
the ruling as a fair judgment and some saw it
as a good way to show the school that Patterson
Court does not need alcohol to operate.

"From a legal standpoint, I understand the
punishment because the school must uphold
its own policies, but at the same time, I’m
very sorry Kappa Sig has gotten in trouble,"
said Pi Kappa Alpha President Michael
Clifton.

“This ruling showed that the court can step
up its self-government,” said White.

Others were more stern in their assesment
due to the severity of the violation.

“Kappa Sig has tested the boundaries in the
alcohol policy before. It is a fair punishment
because the J-Board,.a delegation of its peers,
decided it,”, said Matt Arbuckle. “They are
fortunate. It could have been much worse.”

symptoms of depression are

GETTING A DEPRESSED FRIEND

1. Be persistent. Many people do not
follow advice the first time but will after
it is suggested a few times.

2. Follow up with the person - both to
find out if they got the help they needed
and if it was helpful.

3. Be as specific as you can in your
suggestions - for example, by suggesting
a specific person to talk to and even by
helping them get there.

4. Don’t take it personally if they don’t
do what you suggest right away - show
interest in the outcome, not just if they ,
did exactly as you suggested.

5. Try to reduce the feelings of being
weak orinadequate by letting them know
it’s not their fault.

6. Be optimistic and hopeful about their
getting help - because their own opti
mism is diminished.
