PROFESSOR FULTON
COMPLETES NEW BOOK

Prof. M. Gi. Fulton has completed
the editorial work on a new and enlarg-
ed edition of the poems of Irvin Russell
‘This consists of a number of hitherto un-
collected and unpublished selections.
These poems were obtained chiefly thru
the kindness of his sister, Miss Mary
Russell, of Los Angeles, Cal. An in-
teresting. discovery has recently — been
nade of a series of nearly seventy letters,
covering the periods from the summer
of 1875 to the end of 1878, which he
wrote to a young lady in Indiana.
These contain a great deal of valuable
information of his life and literary
schemes as well as interesting accounts
of life in Southern Mississippi. and of
politics in that section during Recon-
struction times. ‘These letters will ren-
der possible a much fuller biographical
sketch of Irvin Russell, who, altho lit-
tle known and appreciated in the South,
is one of her most distinctive and char-
acteristic writers.

Mrs. Wright; of Winston-Salem, is
visiting Mrs. McMillan.
