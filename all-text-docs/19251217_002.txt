THE DAVIDSONIAN, DECEMBER 17, 1925

Campus football still holds sway over
those who do not go out for any other sport.
There have been several big games between
rival floors, dormitories, counties, etc. The
rules for this ancient sport have never been
revised since last year, yet the games con-
tinue, though not without argument.

Cage Men Meet
Salisbury “Y” on Local

Floor Tomorrow Night

Monk Has to Cut Squad Several
Times as Game Draws Near

Varsi

Tomorrow night the varsity . basketball
team will line up for its second game of the
season. All of the players are in fine shape
after the Concord game, and everything
points towards a snappy encounter. The
same men will start4who played in the initial
game.

Salisbury “Y” is an unknown quantity to|

the Davidson students, since it has not ap-
peared on the schedule during the past few
years. It should be of about the same cali-
ber as Concord “Y.”

These two pre-season games give Coach
Monk a wonderful perspectus of the men’s
ability. Anderson and Laird are playing a
stellar game as usual and form a_ good
nucleus for the team. Wilson, Huie, Harri-
son and Simpson are the other main per-
formers. Wilson with the advantage of
reach over Anderson, has been chosen to

jump center while Anderson goes to guard. |

After the tip-off, however, these two will
exchange places. Anderson was high point
man last season and is one of the best shots
in the state.

Andy Hewlette, who is expected to show
good form this year, is out for the present,
having an indisposed diaphragm. In other
words, his tonsils have recently been lifted.
After Christmas he will be back in condi-
tion. “Andy is also suffering with an injured

THe captain has been eiccted, managers
chosen, letters awarded, and football is all
over until February, when the annual spring
practice is begtri.

er next year. His playing was exceptionally
brilliant many times during the past season,
and promises to be even more so in the sea-
son of 1926. He also has those qualities of
leadership that are essential for a man to be
a real captain to his men.

It must be a hard job for the Athletic
| Councll to select a football manager for the
| coming season. McIlwaine, Woods and Car-
roll have been out for three years and have
worked hard. MclIlwaine was elected and
should prove to be a fine manager since he
{is competent and also a hard worker.

Twenty-one letters were awarded to those
fighting Wildcats who had played in enough
| Sames to merit the wearing of the coveted
\“D.” Six of these will probably never again
| put on the ol’ red jersey and trot out on the
field to fight for Davidson.

That banquet in Gastonia must have been
| quite an affair. Imagine the best high school
| team in the state, one of the best college
| teams, and 35 active and energetic alumni of
| Davidson, all together and pulling for ald

| In the practice game with the Freshmen
{last Saturday the varsity cut loose in the
last half and walked away with the first year
men. The score was rather close at the

second period, the varsity were far ahead.

. The Freshmen have some good material
out for the team, more in proportion than
had the football squad. The team promises
to be better than the Fresh team of last
year, but to be an optimist and predict a
| successful season at this time of the year is
| foolish.

During the dull and quiet season between
football and basketball, the minor sports are
receiving quite a bit of attention. The box-
ing and wrestling squads have increased
noticeably and many good men are out for
positions on the two teams.

half, but after the first few minutes of the|

Ata meeting of the Athletic Council last
Wednesday night, R. H. McIlwaine was
named manager of the Davidson eleven for
the season of 1926. Hebe takes the place of
E. K, Regen, who managed the squad for

|the past season. The selection was made

| from the three Junior assistant managers of
football for this year, McIlwaine, W. S.
Woods, and M. L. Carroll.

| This position of responsibility and trust
| was awarded to McIlwaine after three years
of diligent and faithful work. The selection
was made after careful consideration, as
one member of the Athletic Council put it,
“The only fair way to properly decide on the
manager from these three is to put their
names in a hat and draw one of them.” All
three men had done efficient and noteworthy
work,
