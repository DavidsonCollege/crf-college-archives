Otts Lecturer

Tolbert
interprets the
scripture

By Christy Block

“The Bible is definitely not
speaking by and for itself.” 1994
Otts Lecturer Mary Ann Tolbert
explored the pertinence of the
reader in interpreting scripture dur-
ing two talks delivered last week in
Eu Hall. The Otts Lectures, cour-
tesy of the J.M.P. Otts legacy, have
brought distinguished scholars to
Davidson to address issues of reli-
gious life and Christian faith since
1893.

Mrs. Tolbert, Professor of
New Testament and Early Chris-
tianity at Vanderbilt University,
delivered talks entitled “When
Resistance Becomes Repression:
the Location of the Reader” and
“Who speaks for the Bible: Au-
thority and Power” as parts of her
“Feminist Hermeneutics of the
New Testament” speeches.

During the second of these
talks, Tolbert discussed the prob-
lems of asserting one biblical in-
terpretation over another, which
inevitably occurs when views of
Jesus, his words, and his purpose
are discussed. Views on this topic
are inherently biased and tend to
back up personal political, eco-
nomic and social agendas with a
“divine mandate.” According to
Tolbert, to interpret the Bible for
oneself is “dangerous,and power-
ful” because it calls for thé exclu-
sion of other interpretations.

Tolbert questions the “ul-
timate authority” of the Bible in
church doctrine because she knows
of no direct command from God
for a Bible. Tolbert casts doubts
on the integrity of the church fa-
thers who assigned books to the
Bible which justify “unethical” acts
such as slavery and the oppres-
sion/submission of women.

New Union Board seeks more students

By Phoebe Dean

“You can’t kick it if you ain’t
got feet,” declared the new Union
Board at its first meeting last
Wednesday. That slogan publi-
cizes Union committee sign-ups
on March 1-10 and reflects the
new Board’s desire to involve more
students in its decision-making
processes. -

Sixteen different committees
are responsible for Union program-
ming: Concerts, Davidson Out-
doors, Intimate Performances, 900
Room, Films, Publicity, Video,

Campus Forum, Gallery, Literary
Arts, Speakers, Women’s Issues,
Artists Series, F-Crew, Outpost,
and Cultural Events. Committee
meetings are usually held once a
week but may be held more or less
frequently depending upon sched-
uled events.

As committee members, stu-
dents have the opportunity to voice
their opinions about the kinds of
activities they would like to bring
tocampus. They can participate in
planning and publicizing the events
they create.

Brainstorming by last year’s
committee members resulted in
Solidarity Week 1994, a lecture by
Chinese pro-democracy leader
Chai Ling, and a Davidson Out-
doors spring break sea kayaking
trip.
c “What I really liked about be-
ing on the Concerts Committee,”
stated freshman and new Artists
Series Committee Chairman Brad
Best, “was that it gave me leader-
ship experience. I learned a lot,
working with The Samples, and I
enjoyed feeling that I was doing

something for other people.”

The Women’s Issues Com-
mittee has slated fifteen events for
March (women’s history month),
including forums, speakers, dis-
cussions, and a self-defense work-
shop.

The commitment of this
committee’s members makes the
variety and quality of its program-
ming possible.

Do you have ideas? Join a
Union committee. Sign-up sheets
will be posted in the Union Con-
versation Pit until March 10.

Activist Chai Ling talks al

By Russ Tarver

It was difficult to believe that
the soft-spoken young woman
standing at the podium in the 900
Room last week was number four
on the Chinese government’s most
wanted list in 1989.

Chai Ling escaped from the
Tiananmen Square massacre of
June 4, 1989 in Beijing, China,
with the help of strangers who kept
her and her husband hidden in a
crate for over 100 hours. Chai
Ling is the student leader of the
democracy movement in China;
however, if she were to return .to
that country she would be executed.

Atwo-time Nobel Peace Prize
nominee in 1991 and 1992, Chai
Ling led thousands of Chinese stu-
dents in their protest of the com-
munist regime controlling their
country. On June 4,-1989, more
than 300 peaceful demonstrators
were killed in the Tiananmen
Square massacre, during which
unarmed Chinese students and citi-
zens were surrounded and attacked
by Chinese armed forces during a
peaceful demonstration.

Chai Ling said that her group
merely wanted a chance to have “a
public discussion with the govern-
ment ... equally.”

Sponsored by the Davidson
College Speakers Committee, Chai
Ling began her presentation en-
titled “The Road to Freedom” with

a news documentary detailing her
background in communist China,
her eventual rise to power as a
student leader, and the horrors she
faced in that position. After the
video, those in attendance were
silent as the accomplished free-
dom fighter said, “I wish it never
happened... wish my family could
still be with me.”

Chai Ling explained the birth
of the student movement by de-
scribing misconceptions about her
country that she was told as achild.
She said she was raised to believe
that the people in China were equal
and lived “the greatest life on
earth.”

She described her gradual rec-
ognition of the truth about her
country’s system of government
by saying that “more and more, we
got our education, went to college
... we soon realized that [the com-
munist ideal] was not reality.” Such
revelations began the democracy
movement.

She said that the demonstra-
tions were initially peaceful until
the Chinese government began
using military force to end the
movement. She noted the irony of
the massacre occurring in a coun-
try where everyone is supposed to
have an equal voice: “It is not right
for the government to send tanks
and troops to massacre its own
peacefully demonstrating people.”

Women's Issues celebrates women's month

By Mary Laura Moretz

Women’s History Month will
“set aside a special time to pro-
mote awareness of various
women’s issues,” says Kristin
Garris, former Committee for
Women’s Issues chair and coordi-
nator of this month’s events. The
Committee for Women’s Issues
has filled the month of March with
events to honor the annual Na-
tional Women’s History Month.

According to Garris, the ac-
tivities focus. on “specific issues
such as rape awareness, self-de-
fense, health concerns, political
issues, and academic study of femi-
nist work.” Almost every week-
night in March offers one or more
events, including an assertiveness
training workshop, a forum en-
titled “Exploring Sexuality,” a ca-
sual discussion of the feminist im-
age, the annual “Take Back the
Night,” and various speakers ad-
dressing women’s roles in the
world.

Even the Union movies
planned for this month fit into the
women’s theme as they help stu-

dents examine women’s roles in
popular culture. Fried Green To-
matoes plays March 9 and 11. The
Color Purple shows March 17.
Garris works in conjunction
with the new Women’s Issues
Committee chair, junior Sarah
Orsbon, and with faculty advisor
Dr. Elizabeth Mills. The commiit-
tee of thirty active members meets
about once a week for speakers,
movies, candid discussions with
female faculty members, or study
groups of such books as Our Bod-
ies, Our Selves. Future plans in-

clude bringing men into some
women’s discussion groups for
honest interaction.

Orsbon feels Davidson’s
awareness of women’s issues
should not stop at the end of March.
“There are needs for women on
campus that have not been met
through other forums. With the
Union, the administration, and the
faculty, our committee fills some
of the support gaps.” Yellow cal-
endars of events for the next few
weeks can be found around cam-
pus.

Chai Ling lectured about the massacre at Tiananmen Square.

When pointing out the accom-
plishments of the Tiananmen
Square incident, she said, “After
1989, we see that nobody really
believes in the communist ideol-
ogy anymore.” She used the fall of
the Berlin Wallin 1990 to expound
upon the sudden global rejection
of communist philosophy. In clos-
ing, she explained that the U.S.
could help China by using “their

leverage of political and demo-
cratic pressure to try to push China
toward constitutional reform.”

Chai Ling has been in the
United States for three and a half
years. She was awarded a scholar-
ship to Princeton’s Woodrow Wil-
son School of Politics upon her
arrival. She is still trying to bring
her father, brother, and sister to the
United States.
