The Evolution Of Davidson, Part VI

Davidson Blind Harbor
White Cane Mutinies

By ALEC HOON

Having just returned from an en-
counter with one of the most in-
credible minds I've ever felt, by com-
parison I now feel at a loss to say any-
thing about anything...Dick Gregory
was that amazing. Nevertheless, as it
is now my appointed hour, I will try to
present to you some of the pearls of
wisdom (or ignorance?) that I have
garnered from my existence at David-
son; all the while begging your pardon
for my awkward prose, and hoping
that you will be able to see beyond to
the perceptual world of ideas and
beliefs.

What has been the nature of my
evolution? It has been from the early
ego-tripping freedom to go out, get
drunk or visit the What-a-Woman, and
stagger back to East (now Sentelle)
Dorm at whatever hour and feel no
parental ire (as they were 500 miles
removed), to the sobering realization
that such escapades must be just a
passing fad in my development. It has
been a time of changing values: from
pro-Nixon kill-the-fucking-slant-eyes
God-is-on-our-side Episcopalian to
non-believing skeptic. And in the
fashion of a true disciple of don Juan,
I have begun to ‘‘see’’, for what that’s
all worth.

But somehow I doubt whether any
of you give a flying about my ex-
periences and evolutionary develop-
ment. It is all such a personal thing,
which can have little if any significan-
ce to anyone but myself. All I can say
in response is that while my personal
experiences may be totally
irrelevant, if your experiences have
provoked similar thought patterns,
then we have found a common
wavelength to communicate on. And
if we are to survive intellectually and
emotionally, then communication
must be our sustenance. To com-
municate in some fashion is all I now
seek.

_ As the Grateful Dead so aptly sung
it, “The trouble with you is the trouble
with me, you got two good eyes but
you just don’t see.” That very per-
ceptive statement captures well my
feelings about Davidson. (In the word
“Davidson”, I do not mean the
physicality of this place, but rather
the people here. Davidson College has
meaning only insofar as it serves as a
forum for the interactions of the
minds of those inter jected here. )

Davidson is blind. All too often
people (myself included) become so
emmeshed in the particularities of
their own struggle that they lose all
perspective, ironically, of them-
selves. In the classroom it is that god-
damn grade, the almighty dollar of
learning, that assumes all im-
portance. As many have noted, how
much one has learned is a function of
the relative elevation of one’s GPA.

When will Davidson realize that
knowledge is not in a numerical grade
(and stop awarding Phi Beta Kappa),
and maybe not even in the classroom
itself—that it can only be found where
the mind learns to assimilate various
stimuli into some idea which is more
than the sum total of all the inputs,
and to get satisfaction in such an en-
deavor.

terrupts itself to listen to the wisdom
of a Dick Gregory.

Outside the classroom, the quest for
knowledge is even more tragically
frustrated. When the 1 p.m. end-of-
classes bell sounds, Davidson hurries
either to the library or to the
pleasures of grass. In both pursuits
little if anything is gained.

In the library, where the products of
some amazing minds await ready for
the taking, few bother to search them
out. Regurgitation of a few facts is the

When the 1 p.m. end-of-classes bell
sounds, Davidson hurries either to the li-
brary or to the pleasures of grass.

Unfortunately that time will only
come when Davidson does not get up
in mass at 11 a.m., halfway through
an incredible lecture by Buckminster
Fuller to go to their scheduled classes
and yawn through 50 minutes of a
yearly repeated, stagnant disser-
tation. (But afterall, one is strongly
urged not to miss class: remember
the 98@ rule!) Or when Davidson in-

key. Davidson is seldom challenged to
examine the truth of what it reads
(who is to blame?), but only to
memorize. .

Davidson's pedagogical approach is
so out-dated that regurgitation is all
that is necessary. I’m at fault for
taking the easy route, but is it my
fault alone? If I were a little more
stimulated or if 1 thought that a little
more insight would be expected from
me, then perhaps I would have lear-
ned something rather than briefly
assimilating it. But who cares, I got a
B+ didn’t I. I got a B+ and I can’t
even tell you what 1/5 of the material
in the course was about.

With dope, the veritable assissin of
youth, Davidson also goes down, with
equally pitiful consequences. As an
occasional sensory stimulant and re-
laxant, grass can be useful and
pleasurable (and far less harmful
than booze); but when it is used so ex-
cessively that it becomes the only
means whereby Davidson can cope
with itself, then it becomes tragic. Un-
fortunately, oftentimes Davidson
relies on dope as such a cr utch.

However, what disturbs me most
about Davidson is that it refuses to
utilize the common experiences and
feélings of the people here to establish
any knd of meaningful com-
munication. Davidson opens itself
only to superficialities. Rarely will
anyone confide to others his secret
pleasures or anguishes, for fear that
such an admission is symptomatic of
being fucked-up (or worse).

Life which should be fun (‘‘the best
four years of life’’), becomes merely a
few fleeting periods of elation, over-
whelmed by longer periods of manic
depression because Davidson feels so
painfully alone. Feelings are a barrier
rather than a bond. During:such rare
occasions when feeling or emotion
spontaneously bubbles forth, it is
quickly squelched as Davidsoncalous-
ly laughs at such weakness, so that the
shell around the psyche is further har-
dened. Need I give specific examples?
Who hasn’t said something deeply
felt, and not been cruelly laughed at.
Or who hasn’t wanted to do

something, and refrained for fear of
being mocked.

In its fear and bewilderment,
Davidson looks to its idols: those who
typify the outward trappings of suc-
cess-the guy or girl who is a “campus
leader” or ‘“‘stud” or whatever is a
source for emulation. In the process
the different person is lost in the
scramble to assume the mold. And the
idols are then trotted out as what a
college students should be - in Who’s
Who, ODK, at alumni functions, etc.
What a joke! What makes them
suitable specimens for the holy
pedestal of honor? Why not pay
tribute to the unique individual who
shows feeling for others in his own
unostentatious fashion.

Only when Davidson begins to sear-
ch out feeling can it truly call itself an
“institution of higher learning”. For
learning must be the gateway to un-
derstanding and living in|peace with
the rest of the world. And the only way
that such an idealistic goal can ever
be actualized is when people break
down their walls and admit others into
their world. Certainly no easy task.

Where does this high and mighty
diatribe into what should be (but
which probably never will) leave me.
A friend once characterized himself
as being an optimistic cynic. I think I
could find a place under such an um-
brellic description. I have learned to
“see’’ past my own relatively secure
life and future (from Davidsonian
editor to the University of Pittsburgh
Medical School) to the discontent and
unhappiness of many of those around
me. (I often wonder whether such is
beneficial, for it only brings me down.
Yet where I am now I cannot help. I
can’t nor ever will be able to go back
to the period of my life when my
awareness of others was nonexistent
because I was so wrapped up in what I
was. I see now, and it brings me
down.)

This is the wellspring of my cyn-
cism - When I see things that are
wrong, and feel that they will never be
corrected. To the person with the
dedication and the ability to be a fine
doctor, who will never be given the
chance because he didn’t have the in-
tellectual prowess to make those all-
important grades. To the person who
through no fault of his own was berid-
den with such an childhood
from lack of parental love that he will
be incapable of ever extending or
feeling the pleasures of love. And to
the person scarred with an “‘ugly’’ ex-
terior, who must feel the brunt of
society’s preoccupation with external
beauty.

Is there any hope that these things
will ever be changed? At times - like
when Davidson reaches out through
the Y program to work in the com-
munity or when Davidson gives 300
pints to the blood drive - 1 feel some
small degree of optimism. But we
have so far to go...
