Santana and Dylan bring back the glory days without the glory

By Rachel Newcomb

It’s nice to attend an outdoor
concert on a clear summer night.
Enjoying the sunset and the warm
weather from the parking lot be-
fore the concert really puts you in
a great mood for the upcoming
show. Unfortunately this was not
the case with the September 17th
Bob Dylan/Santana concert at
Blockbuster Pavilion. You could
fee] the beginnings of fall creeping
in, and the sky had been an omi-
nous, depressing shade of gray all
day. Finally, a torrential down-
pour followed us all the way to the
Pavilion. I had seats underneath
the roof, but that didn’t stop me
from getting completely drenched.
All weather complaints aside, I
was ready for a great show to pull
me out of a bad mood. In the end,
I had mixed feelings.

Bob Dylan has been touring
incessantly for the past few years.
He has a reputation for being very
unpredictable in concert, and I’ve
heard people complain of going to
see him and not getting their
money’s worth. I feel lucky to
havebeen able to hear him live; but
I must say I wasn’t floored like I
was at the Neil Young concert a
month ago.

“Dylan opened the set with a
song from his new album that I

enjoyed, He stood nearly motion-
less on stage, looking up from time
to time from his guitar. I don’t
remember the exact order of the
songs, but his next few selections
were definitely some of his more
popular hits. One thing Dylan
seems fond of is changing the ar-
rangements of his musicso that the
songs aren’t easily identifiable at
first. “Stuck Inside of Mobile With
the Memphis Blues Again” opened
with a different arrangement andit
wasn’t until he began to sing that I
recognizedit. He then played “Just
Like A Woman” and the classic
“All Along the Watchtower.”
Dylan next played “She Be-
longs to Me” and “Tangled Up in
Blue,” two of my all-time favorite
songs. I was pleased that Dylan
clearly enunciated the poignant
lyrics of “She Belongs To Me:”
“She’s got everything she needs,
she’s an artist, she don’t look back/
She can take the dark out of the
nighttime, and paint the daytime
black.” “Tangled Up in Blue” was
barely recognizable at first, and
almost sounded like a high-speed
version of the song once Dylan
Started singing. I liked it, though.
Forhis last song, Dylan sang “Blues
in Spanish Leather,” and for the
encore, “Ballad of a Thin Man.”
The back-up band was very

TB

And Thats’ Very Scary.

After decades of decline, the increase in new
tuberculosis cases is alarming. And anyone can get it.
It’s one of the world’s most communicable diseases
because it’s spread from person to person through the
air. The good news is that with medication given in
time, it’s completely curable. The problem is getting
people tested and treated. Especially those who can’t
afford it. Their problem becomes your problem. Because
we all breathe the same air.

good, and they knew the material
very well. They were obviously
able to follow any twists and turns
Dylan took during the course of his

performance. Although I’ve heard | bs
people say that Dylan mumbles his

lyrics, I was able to understand
most of what he had to say. I don’t
have a copy of his new album yet,
but the songs he played from it
were both creative and musically
fresh.

His voice surprised me at how
raw it was. Granted, Dylan has a
very distinct voice, but it sounded
rougher and more strangled than it
does on his albums. The main
problem I had was that I felt Dylan’s
set lacked energy. Everything
seemed very routine, and although
his guitar and harmonica playing
were excellent, he didn’tseem very
excited to be playing. I guess from
aman whoplays 120 concert dates
ayear, this isto be expected. Maybe
a vacation is in order.

Carlos Santana learned
“mariachi” violin and guitar at a
very young age while living in
Mexico. In the early 1960’s, he
moved with his family to San Fran-
cisco, where he honed his musical
skills and formed the Santana Blues
Band. Since then, he has been an
innovative and prolific artist. It is
hard to describe Santana’s music;

IS BACK.

it draws from a strange combina-
tion ofinfluences ranging from the
bluesto Latin music. Without ques-
tion, he is an amazing guitarist.

P’veneverbeena huge Santana
fan but I enjoyed the concert im-
mensely. The set design was the
most interesting I’ve ever seen. A
huge mural, filled with folk-art
paintings of colorful people, cov-
ered the back wall of the stage.

Little paintings were everywhere— ,

in front of the many drum kits, the
keyboards, etc.

The Santana band wasbig and
cheerful. They made up for some
of the energy that Bob lacked. I
won’tsay much about them except
that I was extremely impressed.
Santana’s musicis very distinct—
aunique mix of skillful guitar play-
ing, Latin music, jazz, and blues. I
plan to start listening a little closer

to his music from now on.

For the most part, I enjoyed
the concert. I felt very grateful to
have had ‘the opportunity to see
Bob Dylan live. There is no doubt
that he is one of the most influen-
tial song-writers and performers of
the past thirty years. With his
eclectic lyrics and enigmatic per-
sona, he is definitely a living leg-
end.

I wasn’t overly satisfied by
his performance, but it was a de-
cent show. Santana, on the other
hand, succeeded in bringing me
out of the bad mood that the rain
had put mein. With the exception
of a few rambling songs, it was a
very well put together set. All in
all, it was a once in a lifetime
opportunity to see two musical leg-
ends in the same concert. I can’t
say I was disappointed.
