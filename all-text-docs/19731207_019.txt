THE HODGE GETS NAILED
Sophomore wrestling star Pete Hotchkiss is about to be pinned
by the cutest grappler on the mats, none other than Davidson
junior Betsy Norman. Hotchkiss commented that it was the
most enjoyable beating he had ever received. That is a real
tribute to Ms. Norman, as he has been clobbered many times.
With studs like him, it is no wonder the wrestlers are having

their problems.

Cagers Sell Donuts
For New Uniforms

Basketball is taking on a
new look this year. Due to
dissatisfaction on the part of
team members and finally an

Dunn, a
plemented to supply the Wild-
cats with new uniforms.

The cut and couteur of these
uniforms is to be decided by
head play designer and color
coordinator Larry Horowitz,
just back from ‘‘the coast”’.
Horowitz designed the Staten
Island Fairies’ bared-look this
past year.

In hopes of combining
freedom of movement with the
appeal of the Fairies’ plunging

(and often distracting)
neckline, Horowitz has chosen
a David Bowie motif,

His caped prancers will sport
a thigh long diversionary cape
(opening up a new dimension
in the defensive movement)

and a peek-a-boo jock.

Various ideas concerning
fund raising have been con-
sidered and Mike Sorrentino,
head of the Fund
Campaign, has been left with
the final decision. “‘I plan an
extensive doughnut sale’
commented the astute New
York business financier.

“We have an order with
Krispy Kreme for 1,056,000
glazed doughnuts to kick off
our campaign,” stated Sorren-
tino.

When he performed a few
simple mathematical
calculations, Pete Kyle in-
formed Sorrentino that, con-

““¥es” he explained. Sorren-
tino’s went on ‘to’ say) “We

foresee no problems in con-
vincing the student as a body
to cough up.

‘“‘Probably the most ef-
fective units in our campaign
are our salesmen,’’ Sorrentino
added. Heading up the sales
force is T. J. Pecorak, with
Sheldon ‘‘Boom-Boom’’
Parker as back up man.

Pecorak’s qualifications for
the job are unquestionable: at
6’11” and 300 lbs. his sales
pitch can be, at times (usually
in alleys and deserted hall-
ways) quite convincing.

His favorite target is some
skinny freshman under 5’2’’.
Pecorak's usual approach, he
says, is simple and to the
point: “Hey buddy, how would also
you like to buy 300
doughnuts?”’

Sorrentino has not restric-
ted the campaign entirely to
the sale of doughnuts,
however. Other options are
half-time shows at the
Coliseum and bake-sales.

The entertainment effort
will be led by John J. Falconi,
one of New York City’s most

sought after socialites.
“JJ” is taking suggestions
as to acceptable and socially

redeeming forms of en-
tertainment, such as a ‘‘pretty
legs” contest in which both
teams would have a chance to
Senses
>a
comer for the female audien-
ce.

The team foresees no
problems in obtaining suf-
ficient funds for their uniform

, but should their cam-
fail, Sorrentino stated,
“I have a fundamental belief

that Santa will pull'through.”’

College T. To Construct
$6 Million Fieldhouse

In a surprise press con-
ference held yesterday at the
19th hole of the Charlotte
Country Club, Thomas Cart-
mill, the new athletic director-
designate, teed off on a star-
tling fund drive for a new $6
million athletic complex.

Cartmill stated that the
building would be four stories
high and cover nearly two
acres of land. It will include a
complete indoor field house
which will be the new home of
the ‘‘Parful’’ Wildcat basket-
ball team.

Cartmill stated, ‘In ad-
dition to the field house, there
will be championship facilities
for both swimming and
wrestling. Each of these spor-
ts will have separate
fascimiles for practice and
competition.”

One of the most desirable
features will be the 12 indoor
tennis courts which will be
available only for varsity ac-
tion and the personal use of
high level administrative of-
ficials of the college.

These courts are of the
latest design and will be of
such quality that there is
rumor of a major professional
tennis championship being
held here after the complex is
completed. The courts will be
grass.

The indoor track facilities
are supposed to be of the finest
quality in the country. Sterling
Martin was excited about the
construction, calling it one of
the finest moves in Davidson
athletic history.

Along with the practice foot-
ball field, many other
facilities will be located on the
four new gymnasium sections,
one exclusively for the varsity
basketball team.

All other practice facilities
will be available for student
use.

The ground floor will be
athletic offices and locker
room facilities. All athletic

will be covered at
this position. There will be a
dining facility on this level

The upper two levels will be
the new basketball stadium. It
will have a seating capacity of
17,500 and will also be
available as an ice rink for
future hockey matches.

The basketball complex will
be flanked on one side by the
new swimming and wrestling
facilities. The swim team will
have an olympic size pool and
separate dining area.

The i team will
have the latest equipment for
their sport. Seating capacity
at each of these arenas will be
5000.

On the other side of the
basketball court will be the
new tennis courts. The center
court will be completely
separated from the other
courts and will have a grand-
stand to seat up to 7500. En-
circling this part of the facility
will be the indoor track.

,Cartmill stated that he felt it
was time for the ad-
ministration of this institution
to “‘get on the stick as far as
athletics are concerned.”

He insisted that the

funding
of this project would be the top —

priority of the college for the
next several years.

He outlined the following
three plank proposals as to
how the facility will be fun-
ded:

I. Student tuition will be in-
creased on a pro rata basis ac-
cording to how much one par-
ticipates in the intercollegiate
and intramural athletics.
Those who participate the
least will pay only an extra
$2500 per year. The maximum
increase per student will be
$5000.

II. The amount of money
that the Wildcat Club can
raise toward this project will
be quadrupled by finds from
the Living Endowment. A
grant from the Duke En-
dowment will match the
amount.

III. The final area will be a
rescheduling of the football
and basketball programs so
that the gridders will play
Ohio State, Southern Cal and
Notre Dame, all at the homes
of the opposing schools, and
the Charlotte Invitational
Tournament in Peoria, Ill. will
be increased to eight teams in
a double-elimination holiday
festival. Teams which have
agreed to compete during the
1975-76 season include UCLA,
N.C. State, North Carolina and
Soaring Rocky Mountain

Community Colleg

Tickets ‘le the e festival will
be priced at $15 per person for
the first three preliminary
rounds. The tournament will
become a single-elimination
affair after the first three
rounds when there will be four
teams remaining in com-
petition.

Tickets for the final two
days, which will include the
championship and consolation
games on the final day of the
five-day event, will be sold for
$12 per person.

Cartmill said he hoped to
make $600,000 on the basket-
ball tournament and another
$50,000 from the grid clashes.

Sandy Carnegie, the direc-
tor of the Wildcat Club in-
dicated that he thought they
would be able to raise $250,000
which, when quadrupledby the
college and doubled by the
Duke Endowment, would add
up to $2 million.

Thus, Cartmill expects to
have the complex paid for in
five years or so.

Construction is set to begin
as soon as the architect
designs a suitable dome for
the facility. Buckminster
Fuller, famed architect will
make a special trip in the
spring to consult with ar-
chitects on the possibility of a
geodesic dome.

Fund Bails Out
Sinking Shipmen

In the weeks of the effort to
encourage and strengthen
minor sports here at David-
son, the Wildcat Fund, in con-
junction with the Athletic
Department, has allocated an
additional $150,000 to the
sailing team.

Having operated in previous
years on a G-string, Com-
modore Daryl Douglas and
other team members are
toying with various new op-
tions now open to them. With
the goal of better and more
competitive racing (and win-
ning) in mind, two proposals
proferred by the members are
now under serious con-
sideration.

The need for a ‘‘crash boat”’

in two Coach Walker’s Boston
Whaler during the Fall
Eliminations last year (see

story, Issue #3).

‘We are concerned with our
image as a square-shooting
team,’’ commented Douglas.
“We are going to buy a
destroyer.’’

In an aggressive attempt to
improve the Cat's often
lagging record, a destroyer
has been requested to serve as
committee and crash boat in
future regattas.

When asked how the
destroyer might figure in up-
coming races, Douglas com-
mented, ‘‘With our talent and
depth we could really blow the
opposition off the lake.”’

Although difficult to
maneuver in Lake Norman,
tactics would be planned to
run the destroyer closely in
front of the opposing teams’
boats. ‘‘We could really suck
them up’’ Douglas explained.
