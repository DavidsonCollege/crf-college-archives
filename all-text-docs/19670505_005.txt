Expansion. growth, and
change are the key words as-
sociated with Davidson's ‘new
action’ IMAC for 1967-68.

“The purpose of the IMAC is
to allow each student an outlet
for participation in a sport,”
said track coach Sterling Mar-
tin, adviser to the IMAC, in
explaining proposed expansion.

program to what it should be,”
explained Martin. “We have the
faculty’s support because they
realize that the intramural pro-
gram is the only outlet for com-
petition for about 65 per cent of
this student body. They defi-
nitely want to see our program
grow.” ;

Probably the bigges: change
scheduled for next year is a
proposed intramural handbook
which will contain schedules of

_ the events, the constitution of

the league, rules, and an explan-
ation of the program for fresh-
man. Martin calls it an ‘“‘on pur-
pose"’ book,

‘‘We want to give the impres- b

sion that our program has a
purpose and is headed in a defi-
nite direction,’ said Martin.
Also the Council plans to cre-
ate a publicity office to com-

new system of giving individual
trophies will reduce this.”

“The biggest problem now is
the ideology behind the pro-
gram,” continued Sherrill. ‘We
want this program for those
who are not participating on a
varsity sport team.”

Sherrill favors eliminating all
athletes from all IMAC compe-
tition while they are participat-
ing in a varsity sport.

More sports stressing individ-
ual competition are scheduled
for next year. Fencing, badmin-
ton, decathlon, karate, bicycle
racing, bowling. and water polo
are the sports now being consid-
ered as possibilities for next
year.

The biggest factor in the Coun.
cil’'s proposed growth will be an
enlarged budget. After working
within a 600 dollar limit this
year, the Council has requested
a budget of 4,000 dollars for next
year. .

“We have got to have more
money if we want to build this

cation,"’ said newly elected pres-
ident Doug Rhymes. ‘“‘We hope
the handbook and some public-

_ jty can make our program look
’ more organized.’

Also scheduled for next year
is the initiation of a visiting
speaker program patterned after
this year’s karate program.

The Council plans to begin giv-
ing trophies fot each individual
sport champion such as a flick-
erball champion instead of only
one overall trophy.

“Our league has turned into
an interfraternity league instead
of an intramural program," said
Martin.

“We want the IMAC to reach
those students who otherwise
wouldn't be able to compete,”
said retiring president Jack
Sherrill. “The teams now are
too trophy conscious, and the

also to the clarification of the
eligibility requirement as the
biggest headache facing the
Council. Some clear-cut rule is
needed, Martin said.

“The school needs to decide
what it wants out of the pro-
gram," related Martin. ‘Per.
sonally, I favor the program
being designed specifically for
the non-varsity athletes.”

While Martin and Rhymes fa-
vor an expansion of the program
to more sports, Sherrill feels
the Council embraces enough
activity now.

“I cannot see that expansion
to more individual sports will
help,”* he said. “There is enough
for anyone now in the fraternity
houses and in the Union with

ping pong and pool. I am sure
that the bicycle racing will be
good, and I believe that a golf
tournament should be held both
in the fall and spring. Other
than that, I think there is enough
to do now.”

Sherrill said he thought better
coordination of activities was the
Council’s chief accomplishment
this year.

" “Everything ran smoothly this

year,” he said, ‘‘mainly because
of the interested representatives.
Also, Sterling was the first rep-
resentative of the Athletic De-
partment to serve on the Coun-
cil. The coaches helped us out
quite a lot, especially Coach
Charles Parker and Coach Tom
Stevens."

Martin pointed to the hard
work and leadership of Sherrill
as a chief reason for this year's
success. ‘‘He got the program
off the ground and led it all
year.”’

Martin, Rhymes and Sherril)
all pointed to the freshman
league as the area in need of
the most improvement. The
same separate league status will
be followed next year.

Martin said he hoped the pro-
posed handbook would better re-
late the program to the fresh-
men.

“Our biggest problem was the
lack of interest among the frosh
representatives," and Martin.
“Also this was the first year that
the frosh stayed together for a
whole year and we were not or-
ganized enough to cope with the
new problems. We'll be greatly
improved next year.”

“There is a great need for
improvement in our overall pro-
gram, and we've made a start
in the right direction. We want
to expand slowly enough so that
we won't spread ourselves too
thin,’ Martin concluded.

this with a 26-8 wipeout of the
winless Independents.

The. Phis continued their win-
ning streak with an 18-6 cool-
ing of the SAE’s Tuesday. The
E’s explanation was that they
used up all their power. the day
before when they wipe out ever-

The Pi Kapps climbed out of

week and squeezed into an
eighth place tie with the Nu’s

romped over three teams and
lost to only two this week as
they finally developed a winn

After losing to the Betas,

their season-long hard luck and
whipped the ATO’s, 7-6, for

Jimmy Robinson slammed in
five Pi Kapp runs on three hits,

The Pi Kapps then took on

Belmont Last Opponent
For ’Kitten Fuzzballers

The Wildkitten tennis team
with only one match remaining
has almost completed a rugged
spring schedule. The netters’
only victory came against Bel-
mont Abbey.

Last Friday, the netmen were
upset by the same Belmont Ab-
bey squad, 7-2, at Belmont. Biil
Horton. playing his best match
of the year, crushed his oppon-
ent, 6-0. 6.2. William Brown got
Davidson's other point with a
straight set victory.

Previously in the week, the
‘Kittens met Page High School
of Greenshoro. Central 4-A
champions of last year. and
were defeated. 8-0. The match
was actually closer than the fi-
nal score indicates. Bob John-
son and Horton narrowly lost
three set. matches.

On April 22, the frosh defeated
Belmont Abbey. 5-4, for the sea-
son’s first and only victory. Hor-
ton, Brown, Ken Crews, Gene
Linton and McCrea Ewart all
added victories. The match was
not decided until the doubles
team of Linton and Ewart won
6-4, 5-7, 7-5.

On Saturday afternoon of
Spring Frolics, the frosh proved

_ sluggish and were crushed, 9-0,

by Woodbury Forest.

In review of the season Coach
Frank Spence pointed to the loss
of Randy Jones as one of the
main reasons for the squad's
lack of depth which is the big-
gest weakness of this year's
team. :

“Several matches this year
were extremely close and the
teams we faced with more ex.
perience won."’ said Spence.

Spence pointed Yo the Shelby
and Belmont Abbey matches as
examples of Davidson's “lack
of overall depth and individual
experience.’’

“We were very close to vic
tory in both of those matches,"
said Spence, “but we could not
quite pull them out.”

Spence also felt that perhaps
this year’s team was not quite
as strong as frosh teams in re-
cent years, but he said that
there are still: several players
on the team who will help the
varsity next year. He singled
out Horton and Jones as men
with ‘‘potential who should not
fail to prove valuable varsity
competitors.”

The frosh close their season
with a match against the pow.
erful Duke frosh at Durham
next week.

Jennings Stars For Netters

BY DON SEWELL
Assistant Sports Editor

David Jennings. playing con-
sistently strong tennis, has
played a large role in the suc-
cess of the Davidson netmen
this season.

Through his first 15 matches,
Jennings has compiled a fine
14.1 mark, contributing greatly
to the 14-4 overall record for
the varsity team.

In two of Davidson's losses
this year, Jennings was the only
player to win his singles match-
es. These victories came _ in
matches against South Caro-
lina and Clemson.

Throughout the season he has
maintained his undefeated re-
cord in Southern Conference
competition. He has also com-
bined with Geordie Mueller to
achieve an undefeated confer-
ence mark in doubles competi-
tion. He and Mueller are 9-3 for
the season through the first 18
matches the team has played.

Nickerson Proves Appearances Err

The last place you would ex-
pect to see Clark Nickerson is
on a pitcher's mound. “He just
doesn't look like a_ pitcher,”
said Sergeant Paul Poteat, the
freshman coach. ‘He is not
very tall, and is sort of skinny.”’

But nobody seems to have
told Nickerson what pitchers
are supposed to look like. And
so, even though he had never
pitched in organized baseball
before, he reported when the
first meeting for the freshman
team was called. At the end of
the season, he claimed a per-

,

fect 3-0 record.

“To tell the truth, at first I
was a little scared to put him
in,’ said Poteat. “He had no
real fast ball, and only a little
curve."

“So I started our other pitch-
ers, John Riggs, Cliff Patterson
and Gordon Slade, in the early
