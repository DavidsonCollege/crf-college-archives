ON THE SPORTS
FRONT

Senior outside hitter Mimi
Plauche calls the first match of her
freshman year the most significant
volleyball victory of her career. In
that match, Winthrop won the first
two games and took a 14-2 lead in
the third, but Davidson won the
that game 16-14 and went on to
win the match in 5 games. “Ever
since then,” says Plauche, “we’ve
been on our way.”

The four-year careers of sen-
iors Plauche, Holt Hathaway and
Christy Knight come toanend this
week; the Wildcats play their final
home match Tuesday night at 7:30
against UNC-Greensboro, and
close out their season over the
weekend at the Big South Tourna-

come to be synonymous with
Davidson volleyball itself.
Hathaway, KnightandPlauche
arrived at Davidson in 1988, and
quickly became leaders ona young
team only recently removed from
clubstatus. Foreveryone involved,
the chemistry, bordering on clair-
voyance, between Plauche and
Hathaway was immediately appar-

Faced with a tougher schedule
the following year, the team took
its lumps with a 12-21 mark, but
Plauche, Hathaway and Knight
continued to shine and improve.
They were, of course, the leader-

31-6 team, the winningest in

they have lifted, year by year, the
Davidson program to another level.

\Beach Wins Big South X-C Title,

Leads Wildcats to Second Place Finish

By Richard Wharton
The Davidson women’s cross-
country team roared through their

‘conference finale this weekend

with a second-place finish at the
Big South Conference meet held at
King’s Grant Country Clubin Sum-
merville, South Carolina. The ‘Cats
were led by senior Kathy Beach,
who sped across the finish line in
first place. “I went through the first
600 meters with another runner
who sort of kept with me, but after
that, she faded and no one else
challenged me for the rest of the
race,” Beach said. In fact, no one
else even came close. Beach led
for all three miles, finishing witha
record time of 18:29. Beach’s time
was her overall personal record

Wildcats Top Sixth-Ranked Demon

By Tom Price

The Davidson men’s team
pulled off the biggest upsetof their
season on Sunday as they surprised
the sixth-ranked Wake Forest
Demon Deacons1-0.

Senior Lance Long scored the
winning goal on a penalty kick
mid-way thru the second half. The
play resulted when a “hand-ball”
foul was called ona Deacon player
inside of the goalkeeper box. The
win improves the ‘Cats record to
8-9-2.

Hampden-Sydney Thrashes Wildcat

By Chris Hood
“Hampden-Sydney beat us in
every single way you can beat
someone.”

Head Coach Dave Fagg summed
up accurately Saturday’s 56-14
Parents’ Weekend mauling of the
‘Cats by the Tigers with this state-
ment.

Hampden-Sydney rushed for 386
yards and six touchdowns and
added 227 through the air as their
potent offensive attack kept the
‘Cats off balance all afternoon.
Davidson amassed 333 total yards,
but four interceptions were too
much for the ‘Cats to overcome

offensively.

By Bruce Balestier

With an unsightly four-game
triumph (15-10, 15-4, 12-15, 15-4)
over last-place Campbell Tuesday
night, the Davidson volleyball team
easedintoa 1st-place tie with UNC-
Asheville, and claimed the top seed
in next weekend’s Big South
Conference Tournament. The ‘Cats
will again take on Campbell when
the first round of the Tournament
gets underway Friday in Asheville.

The Camels entered Tuesday
night’s match winless in Big South
play, and just 8-16 overall, and
were clearly no match for the

(PR) for a Sk course.

Following captain Beach’s
lead, sophomore Karen Marshall
ran to a fifth place finish with a
19:18 time. Together, the two ex-
ercised great stamina and strength
to achieve All-Conference per-
formances. Moreover, the two set
the Cats up for their successful
team finish.

Coming in third for the team
was freshman star Elizabeth
Bishop, who with Karen hopes to
continue the ‘Cats’ success next
season. Bishop ran a 20:44, falling
into 15th place, another strong fin-
ish for a fine runner. Behind her
was Sophomore Amy Bertram,
who overcame an injury-plagued
season to come up with a season

The two squads played an ag-
gressive, physical match in which
both teams had excellent opportu-
nities to score. Davidson’s. best
chances came early in the second
half when the ‘Cats were able to
keep the ball in the Deacon half of
the field.

The constant Davidson pres-
sure was finally rewarded when
Lance Long received the penalty
kick. Long waited and let the
Deacon goalkeeper commit to the
right side before placing the ball
into the left corner.

“They are the best team we’ve
played this year,”
Fagg said. “Their
quarterback
(Dwayne
Bowyer) is as
heady andcoolas
anyone I’ve seen
this year...and
they have a great
coach (Joe Bush)
and a great sys-
tem.”

“There’s not

PR time of 20:55 and a 25th place
finish. Bertram used strength saved
up from a low mileage season for
her strong finish, and is eagerly
awaiting the Regional meet, where
she hopes to best her previous
record time.

Fifth for the ‘Cats was sopho-
more Jean DeMoss, who closed
the door on the competition with a
38th place finish and a strong
showing of 21:50. Sophomore Lisa
Sitek finished it out for the Cats,
overcoming a week of illness with
a 22:13 time over the 5k course.
Overall, the team’s top five scored
84 points, proving their strength
and stamina were ample to end
Davidson’s era in the Big South
with a high finish.

Wake Forest greatly increased
their offensive pressure during the
game’s last ten minutes. They had
several excellent opportunities to
score, the most memorable came
at the six minute mark when the
Deacons had three consecutive
shots.

Goalkeeper Alex Deegan

saved the first shot, but itdrew him
away from the goal. Stopper Matt
Spear moved into the goal. and
headed the second shotaway. The
third shot hit the cross bar and
Davidson was finally able to clear

back Richard Howell. “They did a
really good job steadying us; they
were prepared
for us.”

reserves took the floor in game

setter Lorie Logan. Bitter thrilled

the home crowd with an ace for
Davidson’ first point of the game,
and helped the ‘Cats to an early 4-

The Davidson men’s team,
running almost an hour later, gave
it a good, solid effort. Team cap-
tain Ted Richardson finished first
for the Wildcats with a 14th place
finish and a time of 27:23 over the
8K course. Freshman dynamo Eric
McMichael came in 22nd with a
time of 27:42, and sophomore
Richard Wharton finished third for
the Cats in 25th place, running a
27:53.

Fourth for the Wildcats was
