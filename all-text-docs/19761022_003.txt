Stereo enhances
airwaves;
to increase range

By CATHY LANDIS
News Editor

With the installation of a
new solid state, 10-watt exci-
ter, modular design transis-
torized transmitter, WDAV
has gone stereo. Installed last
Tuesday and Wednesday, the
station sent its first stereo
Sunday night at 12:00.

Already Golden detects
changes since Sunday’s first
broadcast. He notes a signi-
ficant increase in the broad-
cast radius, a cleaner, more
efficient signal, and more
space in the studio offices; the
new transmitter takes up one-
fourth of the space than did
the old one.

Golden also notices negative
changes in that the trans-
mitter is more susceptible to
rumble caused by equipment

and picks up background
noise. Golden feels most peo-
ple will not notice the distur-
bance, and those who do will
be able to fix it at their end.

Future innovations include
increasing the effective rad-
iated power to over 18,000
watts. This move now awaits
FCC approval accepted within
the year.

Contrary to rumor, the in-

creased power will not lead to»

replacing student DJ’s with
professionals hired by the col-
- lege. Golden says the rumor
started two years ago when
the college first decided to
increase WDAV’s power. At
the time the college talked
about firing all students and

hiring professionals.

Golden says, ‘‘I don’t know
if that was ever even taken
seriously.”

According to Golden the
college, as of now, plans to use
students as DJ’s.

WDAV, however, plans
staff changes of another kind.
Ideally the station wants few-
er, yet better qualified DJ’s
with what Golden calls a ‘‘pro-
fessional demeanor. People
whowill approach their job
seriously rather than those
who just want their voices to
be heard.”’

Toward that goal the sta-
tion has begun to ‘‘train
freshmen like they’ve never

- done before. The station also

plans to increase student ,in-:
volvement in behind the
scenes production”

The staff now consists of
35-40 DJ’s all with third-
class licenses. Paul Sealy,
from WSOC in Charlotte, acts
as chief engineer, and holds
the only first-class license on
the staff.

One promised innovation
which has yet to be released is
the inclusion of ABC News in
the station’s programming.
The news will go on the air
only when the Physiéaf Plant
Department connects the an-
tenna. The station put in the
request a month ago.

Golden comments, “It’s a
bit of a sore point with me, but
I understand. The Physical
Plant is inundated with work.
It’s just a matter of too many
things to do and not enough
time to do it in.”

Symposium on Galapagos

By JEFF SICH
Business Manager

The Galapagos Islands are
unique and have excited the
interest of scientists and tour-
ists alike. ‘The characteristic
pattern of all visitors is ‘I
want to go back’,’’ said David-
son biology professor David
Grant. ‘‘However, it’s not that
they would like to return but
that they intend to return.’’

It is this feeling of unique-
ness and personal excitement
that five professional biolo-
gists will try to convey ina
“Symposium on the Natural
History of the Galapagos Is-
lands” to be presented Mon-
day, October 25 in Hodson
Hall. The participants include
Grant and Professor Tom
Daggy, both of whom visited
the Islands this summer.

Invited to participate are
Janice Coffey, associate pro-
fessor of biology at Queens
College in Charlotte, George
Folkerts, professor in Auburn
University’s department of
zoology-entomology and Glen

Woolfenden, biology professor
at the University of South
Florida-Tampa.

“The symposium will stress
the uniqueness of the islands,”
Grant said, ‘‘and the fact that
even in professional biologists
there is a very impressive
feeling to be gained by seeing
the islands and discussing
those feelings with others. It
is hopeful that the Symposium

will carry a little of that.’’
The Galapagos Islands lie

astride the equator about 600
miles off the coast of Ecuador.
The islands, volcanic in origin,
represented a biological unit
speartaed from the mainland.
Its flora and fauna, derived
from the mainland have had
thousands if not millions of
years to evolve. Two-thirds
of the resident birds and all
the reptiles are peculiar to the
islands.

“The panelists represent a
broad sprectrum of interests
and expertise in biology.”’
Grant then continued to lay
out the contents of the Sym-

posium which will include a
geological background of the
islands, botanical aspects the
evolution and diversity of the
bird population and the class-
ical Darwinian inhabitants,
such as the iguanas and
tortoises.

“Dr. Daggy will try to make
the transition from plants to
animals in the presentation
with an entomological view-
point of the talasiia. I myself
will handle the noninsect terr-
estrial invertebrates,’’ said
Grant, “including spiders and
also the marine habitats lead-
ing to a discussion of the
mammals found there.”’

“Everyone who has studied
biology understands the im-
portance of the islands in
understanding the theories of
evolution. To stand in the
same places as Darwin
stood—and realize that within
twenty to twenty-five years of
his looking at the life there the
theories had crystallized into
the Origin of the Species.’’,
Grant thoughtfully said.

Media board investigated

By AMANDA HALL
Sports Editor

Following last week's app-
roval of Article XII of the
College Constitution by the
entire college community,
plans are now being pursued
for the establishment of the
Student Media Board. This
board, as described in Article
XI, will serve to govern
student publications.

The SGA (Student Govern-
ment Association) Senate est-
ablished an ad hoc sub-comm-
ittee to investigate and to
establish guidelines for ap-
pointments to the Student
Media Board October 11. It is
uncertain whether the Board
will be in effect by the 1977
publications elections.

The sub-committee, co-
chaired by Hans Watford and
Percy Badham, is to~investi-
gate the problem of appoint-
ment and to recommend pro-
cedural guidelines for the
board, according to a decision
made in Senate meeting of
October 11. iss

The board will have nine
members — two from the ad-
ministration,,appointed by
College President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr., one faculty
member chosen according to
faculty by-laws, three stu-
dents chosen according to
SGA by-laws, and three at
large members from the col-

lege community chosen by the
other six members.

“What in effect we’re doing

‘is setting up the SGA By-

Laws to determine how to
choose the three students.
They (the sub-committee) are
eventually going to come up
with a decision rule to put into
the SGA By-Laws,” said SGA
President Bo Baskin.

The sub-committee will
make procedural recommenda-
tions to the board once it is
established, according to Wat-
ford.

‘‘There are two schools of
thought in the committee,
whether all members should be
from within the media com-
munity, or all should be
completely separate from the
media,’’ he said. ‘‘I think it
will be a compromise.”’

“We need the editors’ ideas,
but we don’t want a conflict of
interest,’’ said Watford. The
Media Board will have the
power to remove an editor
from office.

“It’s pretty obvious to ev-
erybody that we need in-house
people who know what’s going
on,’’ he said.

The Media Board will set up
procedural mechanisms for
selecting an editor and for
removing one, along with
drawing up standards of res-
ponsible journalism, according
to Baskin.

“That requires not only fair-
ness of mind, but knowledge
of newspaper and Miscellany,
or whatever,”’ he said.

Baskin is not certain the
Media Board will be establi-
shed in time to act during the
1977 publications elections.
Watford and Badham have
requested a one-week exten-
sion for their committee,
which will keep the SGA
Senate from acting, on the
recommendations until mid-
November.

The Board will then need to
draw up its procedural guide-
lines in time for the elections.

“It’s possible it will be set
up by election time,’’ said
Baskin. ‘‘In the past we've
always had a screening pro-
cess; if the Board will be set up
by then it will serve that
purpose, if not, the editors
will. They’ve always done it in
the past.”’

“This first go around of .the
Media Board is the most
important one because they
will by setting up the substan-
tive and procedural rules,”’
said Baskin.

A consensus among student
editors is that the Student
Media Board should be res-
ponsible to the students that
the various student publica-
tions serve.

However, creating a gover-
ning body for student publi-
cations with power to remove
editors has frightened some
members of the student media
who have been used to opera-
ting with less restraint.

“T must honestly admit that
including only students who
are also student editors on the
Board might create certain
conflicts centering around
their vested interests,” said
Publications Board President
Matthew Covington.

‘‘T agree with Bo that the
first construction of the Media
Board is important. To serve
all the goals that this first
board must serve, I see it
necessary to include at least
two persons involved in stu-
dent media among the six
students who may. potentially
be on the board,’’ added
Covington.

*‘What I'm interested in
having on the Board is some

who can act in a diplomatic
fashion,” Baskin said.
