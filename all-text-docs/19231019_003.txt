| grounds will be the scene of the contest.

The P. C. Freshmen are an unknown quan-

have the P. C. fighting spirit and will play |
‘a hard game. |

The two games the Fresh have played |
| have not been the kind that bring out every- |
|thing in a team. Their first game with |
| Charlotte High, was ragged and rather list-

less, showing that they hadn't had a chance |

{to develop team work. The second game |
with Furman, showed a decided improvement
and evidence of good coaching. There was
one thing lacking—the final punch. Several
times they were in striking distance of the
goal line, only to be halted abruptly after a
swift march down the field.

Coach Rawson has been working his men |
hard, early and late, picking out and clim-

have been a few changes in’ the
line-up. Henry Sapp is still holding down
full-back and his bullet-like
mighty good, to say nothing of his broken-
field runifing. Goodykuntz has taken Andy
Hewlett’s place at quarter and seems to be
going good. Kelly Johnson and Leggette
are showing up well as halves.

The line is about the same, with MeCon-
nel and Jim King alternating at center. Bo-
hannan has been shifted to end and seems to
feel perfectly home there. Varnadoe,
Christian, Lincoln and Johnson look good in
the line.

nation that should stand out as the Christian
nation of the world, and pointed out why the
United States should a na-

MR. TOM SKEBILL LECTURES,

ON THE NEW RENAISSANCE
Mr. Tom Skebill, an Australian soldier—

idson for a lecture on November Ist. His
subject will be, “The Renaissance in Eu-
rope.” This will-be interesting to those who
discuss foreign affairs.

Mr. Skebill served his country as a soldier
through-out the World War, from which he

poet-lecturer, is scheduled to appear in Dav- |

the Romans, who gave us our
knowledge of law and government; and the
Jews, who gave us our religion. Of these
the Jews was the most important gift, as all
others depend on religion.

Professor Fleagle stated that we are as
much in need of religion today as the people
were in the days of Christ. He said that
there is not any more religion in the world
today than there was in the days of the
lesson.

Several years ago letters were addressed
to one hundred Americans, all of different
professions and trades. These hundred men |
represented. the average American. The
question asked them was: What is the Most |
Outstanding Characteristice of the Ameri- ,
can People. Out of the hundred, 46 Said |
that service to their fellow man was the out- |
standing trait. 27 said that material suc- |
cess was the outstanding trait. The third |
largest answer was that search for truth |
and justice was the outstanding character-
istic |

The questionaires were sent out to get an
idea as to how well the American nation is
fitted to be the leader as a religious nation. {
No other nation can show that they possess |
the traits that men stated the American |
people have.
