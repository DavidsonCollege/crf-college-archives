IMAC Elects Thurman;;|
Gams Lead In Softball |

‘BY DON TYLER

The IMAC met in the
College Union last night
and elected officers for the
coming year, They are:
President Mike Thurman,
a member of the Phi Delta
Theta; Vice-president Tom-
my Hunter, a Kappa Alpha;
and Secretary Pat Hubbard
of Alpha Tau Omega.

It seems that not only will the
Phi Delts have next year's
president, but they also have
a good chance of winning the
IMAC championship this year.
So far they are in first place
with only softball, tennis, and
volleyball remaining this year.
As of now they are in fifth place
in the softball standings with a
record of two wins and one de-
feat.

The Kappa Sigs are in a
three way tle for second place
with the PiIKA’s and the Sigma
Chi‘'s with a record of two wins
and no defeats. The Phi Gam's
are in first place at the present
time having won three games
and lost none.

One of the major questions to
come before the IMAC is the
classification and points given
to various sports. Under the

CAT TALES

BY JOHNNY CLARK

Davidsonian Sports Editor

A NEW MEMBER?

East Carolina College will again try to gain admit-
tance into the Southern Conference when the league’s
Faculty Committee on Athletics meets May 1 in Roanoke.
The Greenville, N. C. school has been trying to get in

since it left the old North

State Conference, now the

Carolinas Conterence, three years ago, and the odds on
making it next month seem pretty good.

__ President Martin has written the president, athletic
director, and faculty committee representative of every

member school to say that
East Carolina, and that our

Davidson favors admitting
faculty representative, Dr.

Paul Marrotte, will vote for their application.

And as far as | can see,
they shouldn’t be let in.

there isn’t any reason why

E.C. has 6,000 students, more than every member
school except West Virginia and George Washington,
and with eight athletic teams, its athletic program is
strong as or stronger than those of several of the South-

ern’s membership. It is now

an NCAA member, and as

an NAIA affiliate it won two national championships in
swimming and one in baseball from 1957 through 1961.

Football is also strong.

The Pirates lost only one

game last year, whipping the ACC’s Wake Forest 20-10
and winning a minor post-season bowl game.

E.C.’s athletic facilities

seem more than adequate:

They include a new 16,000-seat football stadium with
area for expansion, a new $85,000 track, and a 6,000 seat
gymnasium now under construction.

The southern half of the league (Davidson, Furman,
Citadel) would have scheduling problems decreased with
E.C.’s admittance, and Greenville is a convenient loca-

tion for the northern schools

to play on trips to Davidson

and South Carolina. The addition would increase North
Carolina’s interest in the Southern Conference and thus

help Davidson.
Weighed against these

favorable factors are the

liabilities of the school’s association in the mind with the

old name of “E.C.T.C.” and

the reluctance of some to

expand the conference past nine members.
E.C. easily meets all the requirements for member-

ship eligibility,

chief of which are recommendation of

three members, subsidized athletics, NCAA membership,
favorable geographical location, and participation in six

sports (football, basketball,

baseball, track, and two

others). It must also be recommended by the Conference
Athletic Directors Association, who consider athletic
facilities, athletic budget, and contribution to conference
prestige, all of which are factors in which E.C. rates

favorably.

It seems evident that East Carolina would be an
asset to the Southern Conference, which, except in the

area of basketball, is pretty
hope they make it.

much in need of assets. I

Frosh Falter, Fumble
In Losing To Prepsters

BY BILL BRIGGS
For the past four games the freshman baseball team seems to have been missing
something. In particular, 4 of the first 68 men to bat for the freshmen missed some-
thing—the ball—to record 44 strikeouts for opposing pitchers. The team missed
hits also—getting none in the first game and only six in the next two. But things
are improving.

Race To 91-54 Win
Over Richmond

BY WAYNE LANE

The Wildcat track team
routed the Richmond Spid-

saw individual scores soar
as the thinclads brought

‘|| their dual meet record to

voint effort from David

Fleagle in 1933.

dominating the jumps the ‘Cats

events. Wallace won the discus
with a toss of 123°11'°. the jave-
lin with a throw of 148'11". and

Brown won the high hurdles in
16.2 and the broad jump with
a leap of 20°5°’. He also placed
in the high jump, the pole vault
and the hop, skip. and jump.

Billy Mills won the pole
vault with a vault of 11°6"° and
the hop, skip. and jump with a
jump of 40°11". He also picked
up a third in the high hurdle
and a ‘second in the high jump
to contribute 14 points to the
winning cause.

John Barrow took the 3 mile
run in 16 minutes 13 seconds.
Rufus Adair jumped 5°11" to
take the high. jump and later
placed second in the discus.
Steve Gill took the 440 with a
time of 51.7 and Denny Phil-
lips won the mile in 4:33.3 to
round out the individual win-
ners for the ‘Cats.

The trackmen completed a
sweep of the meet by taking

A quick glance at the record
is’ deceptive. One might draw
the conclusion that the team is
not playing up to Davidson
standards. The first three
games saw the opposition score
38 runs to Davidson's 2: how-
ever, the squad bounced back
strong from the first three de-
feats to almost beat Ashley
High of Gastonia. In this last
outing the freshmen more than

victory, but still lost 13-0. Bry-
ant Hinnant led the team in
batting (! for 3). Hinnant,
whose season average is .500,
and who leads the team in that
department, unfortunately has
a higher batting than fielding
average. Against Hunter Huss
he managed 1 for 6 from the
field.

Faced by such dire circum-
stances Coach Roger Thrift

man PE classes for material.
