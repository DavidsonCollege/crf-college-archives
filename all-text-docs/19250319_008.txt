| Miss Kalista Hood, who attends St. Mary's
jin Raleigh, is spending the spring holidays
| at home.

| The Young Matron’s Club met on Monday
| afternoon at the home of Mrs. H. B. Elliot.
| Delicious refreshments were served.

Last Friday afternoon Mrs. E. J. Erwin
held an informal tea in honor of the sister
of Mrs. Daugherity, who has been visiting
here for the last week.

On last Friday evening the Senior C. E.
Society gathered in the basement of the
Presbyterian Church. Interesting and en-
livening games were played and thoroughly
enjoyed by all until the refreshments were
served, when all games were forgotten in the
contest to discover which one present was
the best Eskimo. The prize will be awarded
to Riggs’ McConnell at the next social.

Again on Monday night the basement of
the Presbyterian church was the scene of a
joyful gathering. The Intermediaté C. E.
Society held a most interesting program of
games, songs, andstump speeches, by which
the evening passed all too soon. Delicious re-
freshments were served.

in their studios or otherwise intimately en-
gaged upon the work which made them
famous. It is not a treatise on sculptors, but
a series of life stories of the sculptors them-
selves. It is informal, chatty, and otherwise
removed from the formal review.”

Salt Water Poems and Ballads, by John
Masefield.

“This is a new issue of the one volume of
Mr. Masefield’s work which, in the opinion
of many of his admirers, contains the very
best of his poems of the sea. It is illus-
trated with a large number of pictures in
color and in black and white by the well-
known English marine artist, Charles Pears.”

Psychology and the Christian Life, by Rev.
T. W. Pym.

“Recent developments in the realm of the
new psychology have called for a new state-
ment of its application in the field of Chris-
tian faith, This Rev. Mr. Pym has very ably
and very completely done. It is not so much
speculative and theoretical as a_ practical
treatment of the subject. We have here a
pioneer book in the art of applying the new
psychological methods in Christian life.”
Orator’s Manual, by George L. Raymond.

“It is undoubtedly the most complete and
thorough treatise on oratory for the practi-
cal student ever published.”—The Education
Weekly, Chicago.

The anthology issue of The Davidson Col-
| lege Magasine, which came off the press last
| Saturday, is the one purely literary publica-
|tion of the students for this year. It con-
ltains a wealth of poems, essays and stories
jon widely varying topics by about 20 differ-
;ent authors. In contrast to last year, when
four numbers were published, this year the
one number will contain the choice works of
the literary material submitted for publica-
tion.

The editors selected six stories, nine essays
and 17 poems to appear in this anthology is-
sue. It is the opinion of the students, who
had copies of the magazine delivered to them
in their rooms Saturday night by Business
Manager L. L. Deck, and his assistants, that
it far surpasses any other similar publication
put out in years. It is, as the word an-
thology signifies, a choice collection of lite-
rary work,

| First should be mentioned the poem And
You Shall Say, by E. P. O'Connor, which
was published in Poets of the Future, a col-
lection of college verse published at intervals
by The Stratford Co., Boston, Mass. The
editor of this collection gave honorable men-
tion to three other poems, 4s We See It, by
P. M. Patterson; A Wish For ’26, by C. F.
Smith, and The Sanctuary, by A. M. Martin,
appearing in The Davidson College Maga-
sine,

,; The six stories from the body of the mag-
azine are true types of the short story art.
A. F. Simpson, in The! Last Shot, tells a
story of the Old South with an appeal to
lovers of its traditions and history. It is
written in a clear and vivid style. Mr. Hydz
Remodeled, a story by R. W. Walker, ‘is
based on a double personality plot. It is a
hard one to deal with but Walker makes an

interesting and unusual story out of, it. S.

Criticism of Anthology Issue of the
Magazine is Submitted by Covington

W. Brown, in The Man Who Went Beyond,
W. C. Deden, in Omar, and H. C. Lawson,
in Worthless, have written stories of excep-
tional merit.

The essays, some short and some long, are
all good. However, The Hummingbird; by
R. T. Kimsey; The Next War; by L. D.
Wharton, and A Ramble Through the Uni-
verse, by R. W. Graves, are of especial
worth. The Next War is a brief rebuke to
America for having accepted the phrase
“next war” as a fact. The Hummingbird
shows the author’s thorough knowledge of
the bird’s habits and life and is interesting as
a nature study. Although not as readable to
the general public as the other articles, 4
Ramble Through the Universe could not have
been written but by a student of astronomy
and is worthy of careful reading.

The 17 poems interspersed among the
stories and essays add greatly to the tone
and interest of the magazine. Most of these
are short, the only one as long as a page be-
ing A Moth That Would Seek a Star, by E.
P. O'Connor. This is a fantasy of charm.

The Cap and Bells contains this year, in-
stead of a collection of jokes, four humorous
stories and seven poems, thus raising the
literary tone of the department. It is vastly
more attractive and enjoyable than the for-
mer joke columns. Touchdown, the only story
which was claimed by its author among the
four, is funny from beginning to end, due
partly to the local touch.

The editors and contributors have done
well in publishing this magazine which should
rank high in the collegiate literary world.

Credit should be given to L. L. Deck, the
business manager, who now has the magazine
on a sound financial basis.| He has this year
paid off last year’s debt and has put out this
issue without any deficit.
