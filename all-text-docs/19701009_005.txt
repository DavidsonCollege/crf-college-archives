HOME VIOLENCE BAD

Ed. Note: The following
statement, “The Folly of
Undisciplined Radicalism,”
is taken from a letter mall-
ed by U. S. Senator George
McGovern
student interns on August
31, 1970. The statement was
delivered to the Senate on
September 1, 1970.

The recent bombing of the
Math Center at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin, which
claimed the life of a young
researcher, is one of a series
of violent acts: which under-
score the folly of undisci-
plined. radicalism.

Bombings tn various parts
of fhe country: have come
with alarming frequency in
recent months. .

These tactics and othe
wild rhetoric that has afflict-
ed. some __ revolutionary
groups are apparently based
on-the—-notion that—the ends
justify. the means.

But the bombers, and
other irresponsible advocates
of violence, threaten all that
is decent in our society.

They sometimes claim to
be operating as anti-war
agitators. But We cannot end
violence abroad by _practic-
ing it on each other here
at home.

Indeed, the tactics of vio-
lence only ensure a self-de-
feating counter-reaction that
leads not to peace and jus-
tice but to conflict and re-
pression.

I regret that some radicat>.

youth leaders have lost con-
tact with both reality and
their own professed
ism.

Radical theoreticlan Tom
Hayden’s recent remarks to
the. National Student Asso-
clation Congress, as report-
“ed in the Washington Star
of August 19, 1970, Illustrate
the point.

In glorifying the recent
kidnapping of a California
Judge which led to his death
and that of three other peo-
ple, Hayden endorses the
very barbarism that he_-pro-
fesses to despise.

In claiming that Panther
leader Huey Newton was re-
leased from prison because
of the guerrilla “kidnappers
of Uruguay and Brazil, Hay-
den has gone beyond the
limits of either reason or
honesty.

Newtén was released not
because of Latin American
kidnappers, but because an

American court gave him

the beneficial protection of ;
our judicial systém, and
found error: in his trial.

The ‘great weakness of
many American radicals
such as Hayden is that their
vision Is limited only to the
dggakness of our society:

sEven though their own
freedom depends on _ the
American legal and political
System, they use that free-
dom to proclaim the worth-
lessness of the system. that

makes their protest possible:

At the same time, they
naively imagine that the re-
voluntionary socie

Thus, the American. radi-
cal all too frequently wears
one set of blinders that en-

ness of: our society, white

JOE _SMITH

another sét of blinders en-
ables him to see only the
virtues of the, Utopian al-
ternatives he reads about in,
radical literature.

Normally, he is comforted
in his blindness by the afflu-
ence and relative security
provided by the system he
condemns.

What I personally resent
most about some American
radicals is their willingness
to jeopardize the chances of
constructive change. by
flaunting their own foolish
and destructive tactics.

They have invited the $o-
called hard hat reaction to
the peace effort by such an-
tics as displaying Vietcong
flags, disrupting courtrooms,
shouting obscenities and
other obnoxious patterns of
conduct.

Instead of building a
broader base on the nearly
universal hunger of man for

peace, they seem determined
to isolate the peace move-
ment from any kind of .effec-
tive relationship with other
human. beings.

This kind of reckless poli-
tical action may- be enjoy:
able for affluent youth cut
off from the real word, but
it is a grave «injustice, to
those who seek an. end to the
war and misery.

“Phe irresponsible militant
“doing his thing” ata peace
rally or in a courtroom is

undermining those dedicated

to the long, hard effort to
influence public opinion to
ward peace and justice.

The Jerry Rubins and the
Abbie Hoffmans have done
all right for themselves do-
ing their own thing. They
have made themselves into
nationally known personali-
ties complete with lucrative
fees. But they have dis-
credited in the public mind

legitimate efforts for peace
and justice. .

I_ repudiate the tactics of
the Jerry Rubins and the
Abbie’ Hoffmans. And I re-
pudiate the foolish words of
Tom Hayden, ‘spoken in
praise of the California court
tragedy, and. the Latin Ame-
riean kidnap’ killers,

Their antics betray the
hundreds of ‘thousands of
concerned people, young and
old, who have worked and
talked and walked for peace
and justice, They betray the
thousands of people young .
and old who work for candi-
dates dedicated to a better
soceity,

They, betray those in pub-
lic life who have invested
their lives in the cause of a
mote humane and peaceful
society. And, they betray
their own hopes for a more
harmonious world based on
the bratherhood of man.

Academia Must Handle Alienation

This year's Cause for Con-
cern scems to be the rise of
anti-intellectualism in the
land, From all segments of
the college there are hints
that the alienation of - the
academic community from
the society in which it oper-
ates is more than an ex-
tension of the town-gown con-
troversiies which have oc-
curred all over the world
for centuries.

The seriousness of the sit-
uation having been admit-
ted, solutions are immedi-
ately forthcoming. All of
them are based on the as-
sumption that what we have
here, .to paraphrase St:
Luke, is a failure to commu

nicate.

‘Some argue chat all that
is necessary for the amelio-
ration of ‘Davidson's. pro-
blems with ‘the alumni and
society in general, is to
make sure that everyone
knows that the violence and

‘destruction whigh they see

on the the evening news are
not. happening here. Others
expand this argument to in.
cludé the reassertion of the
importance of reason on the
the campus, Professor Jack-

son amending it to maintain
that the search for Truth at .

Davidson is in the public in-
terest.

Although it is encouraging
that the leadership of the
college regards outside hos-
tility as a problem worthy
of note, the proposals out-
lined above are totally in-
adequate to deal with it.
Good public relations, how-
ever valuable they may be
in our neverending efforts
to beef up the Living Endow-
ment, is of little consequen-
ce in solving the problem un-
der consideration, for it fails
to cope with the principal
cause of our difficulty: the
presence on this campus, as
on many others, of overween-
ing moral and intellectual ar-
rogance.

There is a great, deal of
talk here, both in and out
of class, about the problems,
facing Mankind. ‘The — sub-
jects of racism, _ poverty,
war, and .th€  fuination- of

here, precious little is ac-

easier to cope with sodiety
as. an abstraction than it is
to deal with it as itt is: a
melange of personalities,

Those who are not fortun:

of the academic community
are lacking in breadth of
vision which higher: educa-
tion can give, a natural con-
sequence of that condition
of life known as “making
ends meet,"’ It would seém
to be an obligation of the
educated man, given this
situation, notyonly to assert

the purity of reason in his
academic womb, but to seek
to widen the horizons of
those outside and. to under-
stand them.

The tired cliche. about
‘making the system work"’

is one of the most re.
vealing indicaters of aca-
demic’ arrogance, for _ it

implfes that the system only
works . if it~ produces the re-
sults we desire. But this at-
titude of giving democracy
“one more. chance, its “fail-
ure” bringing the withdraw-
al of the young, is not hard
to understand when one con-
Siders that the slow, painful,
and not always rewarding
task of consenus-building is

“shard work. Elitism is much

easier and much more psy-
chologically satisfying.

The problem. which the
academic community — has
with the outside world can-

‘not be solved institutionally,

for it is the result of the
actions and attitudes of
those within the communi-
ty. The tragedy of the pre-
sent alienation of the univer-
sity. is not that it will draw
some sort of reprisal from
the outside, but that it will
deprive society of talented
people willing to accept the
frustrating, yet crucially
important task of democra
tic leadership.
