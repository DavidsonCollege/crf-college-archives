Johannas Likes

Cars and Truman

By MIKE MYERS
Charming, I think, is an undesirable word to tag on a boy.
Yet no other adjective better. fits Johannas Miedema. foreign

student studying at Davidson.

Johannas’ personality is over-

powering. his broad smile contagious, and his friendliness leaves
you with mixed emotions of warmth and humility. I've never

had an easier time talking to any-
one,

As we sat chatting on the library
steps in the blazing Indian summer
sun, Johannas’ thoughts drifted
back to his native Steins, Holland.
I learned Steins is in the northern-
most portion of Holland, ten miles
from the coast. “I'm going to miss
our lovely winters. Ice skating is
one of my favorite pastimes, but I
told him about Reynolds Colesium
and the skating done there.

Johannas immediately perked up.
“Now «isn't that just like Ameri-
cans. Ice skating indoors in the
summer! I was in New York five
days and never have I seen such
people as you Americans or such
a place as N. Y. Nothing but iron,
steel, and glass—yet not so pretty
as Paris.’ I couldn't argue with
him.

I hated to ask such an un-
original question, but I knew
it would come sooner or lIater..
He replied without a minute's
hesitation. “What impresses
me most about America is the
cars—everywhere cars, In Hol-
land it is the cycle. I can’t
even drive. I guess the stu-
dents here think I am a smoe.”
Now where did he get that
word?

Johannas left his father (farmer
and potato exporter), mother, and
two younger brothers in Holland to

come to Davidson for a year's
Study of economics, history, geog-
raphy, physics, and English. Then
he will take up his number 1! pleas-
ure, camping, and travel around
the world, His reason, in his own
words, is “to meet people, make
friends and improve international
relations so 1 won't have to meet
them later with weapons.”

Monday he did something I
was too lazy to do. He went
to Winston to hear Truman
speak and was impressed with
the president’s unostentatious
manner. Then Johannas bash-
fully added he also went up to
see a Swedish Salem girl he had
dated homecoming.

The tall blond Dutchman. is
grateful to Sigma Chi fraternity for
sponsoring him here in Davidson.
He has no plans upon his return
to Holland, but he wants to event-
ually live in America. ‘*When I
get back home maybe the army
will have an invitation for me.”

I hope not, Johannas.

The foreign affairs intern pro-

gram, which will begin in Septem-
ber, 1952, will include 50 members

selected through a screening pro-

cess designed to secure a highly

qualified group of people who show
promise of developing into top ad-
ministeators for
years to come.
As the case last year, the de-
partment will select trainees for
the foreign affairs intern program

from the register of those who

pass the Civil Service Commission’s
junior management assistant ex-
amination, This examination will be
announced by the commission in
October. Applications must be on
file with the Commission by No-
vemher 13 so that the applicant may
be. certified to take the exdmina-
tion when it is given, in all parts

of the country, on December 8. It

is of the utmost importance that
students who wish to be appointed
in the department file for, and take,
this junior management assistant
examination. The Civil Service
Commission will send announce-
ments to John P. Dillon, in the
college placement office and, in

_| addition, the ‘announcements will

be posted in all, first and second
class post offices.

Students wishing to be considered
for the foreign affairs intern pro-
gram must also be nominated to
the Department by the Department
of State nominating board which
has been established by the facul-
ty.
Dr. Cunningham has appointed a
Department of State nominating
board at Davidson: consisting of
Chairman E. O. Guerrant, Frontis
W. Johnston, and A, G. Griffin.

Selections made by the nominat-
ing board must be received by the
Department not later than Decem-
ber 1, 1951, that is, about one week
before the junior management as-
sistant examination is given. The
Department has found that the cor-
relation between those nominated
by their colleges and those passing
the junior management examina-
tion is very close, so that students
selected by their college boards

have an excellent chance of being |”

selected for the foreign affairs in-
tern program. Students should get

Hin» touch with their faculty advisers

or the chairman of the nominating
board as soon as possible and ask
to be considered for nomination to
the Department of State.

Foreign affairs interns will re-
ceive nine months of specialized
on-job training which will include
courses at the Department's
Foreign Service Institute, periodic
conferences and seminars, and both
observational and work assign-
ments in the, various operating di-
visions The foreign affairs intern is
given the unique opportunity of ob-
serving how the Department of
State seeks to discharge its re-
sponsibilittes for promoting the
national interest and welfare
through the conduct of business
with the more than 70 nations with

the challenging

which the United States has com-
mercial and politica. relations. The
intern will find the answers to his
questions from the people who are
in positions of responsibility, and
perhaps most important of all, will
discover, through actual experience,

suit his training and aptitudes.

Camera Club
Wants Members

The Davidson College Camera
Club has changed its regular bi-
weekly. meetings to Wednesday
nights at 7:15 p.m., instead of its
former Tuesday night meetings.

The Camera Club cordially in-
vites everyone who is interested
in photography, or who would like
to learn the hobby, to attend its
next meeting this coming Wednes-
day night, October 24, at 7:15 p.m.,
in the Physics classroom, north
end of Chambers.

The club’s dues are nominal, and
they go towards buying more equip-
ment for the Club’s darkroom, !o-
cated in the basement of Watts
Dormitory.

Allan Macy is president for 1951-

Dear Editor:

It was with extreme skepticism
that I read the announcement on
Chambers bulletin board today,
stating that all student body mem-
bers would be required to wear
blue blazer sport coats and black
knit ties for their picture in Quips
and Cranks.

Some Joke

Surely, 1 thought, it was some
sort of joke that Bill Adams was
playing on the student body. He
couldn’t mean what he said, I knew,
but I was oh, so wrong for this very
same morning an announcement
was made in chapel to the same
effect.

Now, I’m not sure what Bill had
in mind when he made this de-
cision, but I can assure him that
whatever it was, it doesn’t meet
with the whole-hearted approval by
the student body.

Perhaps if this were a mili-
tary school or a reform school
or even “boys town,” this ar-
rangement would be appro-
priate, but not here at David-
son. I for one, don’t want to
look like a convict in my an-
nual picture, simply because of
some idiosyncrasy of the edi-
tor.

What does he plan to do, put
a number under each picture
so that we can distinguish one
inmate from another?

It is my opinion that the clothes

52, and Andrew Simons, Jr., is] boy wears are a means of show-

secretary-treasurer. The faculty
sponsor is Prof. John Pietenpol.

As in the past, the Club will spon-
sor a monthly contest, the “Photo
of the Month,” which is selected
from entries submitted by its
members. The group also has an
exhibit during Fine Arts Week, held’
near the end of school.

ing his individuality and possibly
his personality. But when it gets
to the point where a student can-
not wear the type coat or tie he
wants, for his picture in the an-
nual, something ought to be done.

1 would agree with the editor on
one point, this type of picture
would add uniformity to the an-
nual. Indeed, it would be quite ap-
pealing to thumb your way through
an annual where everybody looked
alike except maybe for the way
he combs his hair! !

Not the Place

Seriously, though, I want to say
that I don’t think our annual is
quite the place for this uniformity
of dress, What about the rest of
the student body?

Sincerely,

injury. Knee ailments made the
running of Guiton and White vir-
tualy ineffectual, and on defense
they were woefully impotent. White
showed last ‘week that he has
snapped back in fine style, but

Guiton remains on the sidelines.
Finally, the injury Little
feared most—that to his lone
experienced quarterback, Jack
Ruth, has come. An ankle
twisted in Monday’s practice
may keep the chunking junior
out of action Saturday. It’s not
so hard to take, Little con-
