student Integrates
Themes Of South
Korea Into His Work

By DAVID MCPHERSON

The work of Se-Hoon Oh rep-
resents an auto-biographical inves-
tigation of the artist’s childhood
experiences in a small South Ko-
rean town near Seoul.

Most of the works are investi-
gations of dream-like scenes in
which the boundary between ani-
mate and inanimate objects dis-
solves.

An important piece interms of
fusing the artists identity with that
of the landscape’s is “‘Conversa-
tion with the Mountains.”

Se-Hoon depicts the crooked
peak of Kwan-Ak mountain which
he would often talk to as a child.
Heuses flat, brightly colored forms
tosymbolize the organic irregular-
ity of the mountain and surround-

ing landscape.

Se-Hoon depicts
the.crooked peak
of Kwan-Ak
mountain which
he would often
talk to as a child.

- Another work which suggests
the artist’s communion with his
surroundings is entitled “Streets of
the Village.” This work recalls the

melting psyctiological landscapes

of Arshille Gorky in works suchas
The Liver is the Cock’s Comb
(1944).

“Se-Hoon uses dripping firms
to create a surface which appears
to be growing through its soften-
ing and merging of form. “Pa-
chul-bu”, aterm thatroughly means
maid, portrays a woman clad in
baggy work pants.

The figure emerges from a
warm undulating darkness, and Se-
Hoon tempers any sentimental
intimacy of the woman with short
jagged brush strokes. Even in this
figure the weather-worn toughness
of an Earthly form emerges.

Se-Hoon’s work borrows from
a variety of modernist traditions,
perhaps the most noticeable of
which is Surrealism. Despite this
debt, he is able to invest these
traditions with an artistic vision
which is intensely personal. :

It is this vision which makes
Se-Hoon’s work rare in compari-
son to most student works which
often adopt stylistic forms but fail
tO Conviliciligly transform them for
their own use.

His vision has not found a per-
manent stylistic model, but the
search has produced interesting
results. The confidence with which
Se-Hoon knows himself and his
abilities are promising signs for a
young artist.

Se-Hoon's exhibit is currently on

What Your Blood Pressure Means

I couldn’t give blood last
Wednesday. I waited 45 minutes
in line to be told that my blood
pressure was “too low”.

As I looked at the nurse in dis-
belief, I realized that I wasn’t quite
sure what the concept of “blood
pressure” actually meant, and why
it meant wasted time for me. I
knew it had something to do with
“systolic over diastolic,” but I
wasn’t sure.

For the curious, blood
pressure is the pressure under
which the blood is pumped through
the circulatory system.

Blood pressure varies among
~individuals and even from hour to
hour in the same person, depend-
ing upon their activity level and
their level of nervous excitement.

A sphygmomameter is the
instrument with the arm cuff that
they use to take your blood pres-
sure. Blood pressure is measured
from the brachial artery of your
arm. (Remember, arteries are the
vessels that take oxygenated blood
away from the heart.

Blood pressure is generally

higher in arteries than in veins.)
When the cuff is put over.the bra-
chial artery and tightened, itcom-
presses the artery. Meanwhile,the
nurse is listening to your arm
through a stethoscope.

When the sound of a pulse can
np longer be heard, she or he slowly
begins to release the air in the cuff
and blood begins to flow back
through the artery.

A sphygmomame-
ter is the instrument
with the arm cuff
that they use to take
your blood pres-
sure.

When the pulse is first heard
again, the nurse looks at the sphyg-
momameter’s gauge, where the
mercury has shot up a tube to a
certain height. The nurse then rec-
ords this reading as the systolic
pressure.

Meanwhile, air is being con-
tinually let out of the cuff, and at
the point where a pulse can n¢
longer be heard, the reading on the
gauge is recordedas diastolic pres-
sure. Systolic pressure is the pres-
sure at the time of a heartbeat. Itis
the maximum blood pressure on
the arterial walls. Diastolic is the
minimum pressure, representing
the time between heartbeats when
the heart is at rest.

Review / Restaurant

Normal systolic pressure is
somewhere between 120-150 mm.
Hg. (mm. ofmercury onthe gauge).
Normal diastolic pressure is be-
tween 80-100mm.Hg. “Low
blood pressure” is defined as sys-
tolic < 110, and diastolic < 70. Itis
associated with exhaustion, weak-
ness, dizziness, and feeling faint.

Temporary low blood pressure
can occur due to shock from in-
jury, surgical operations, diabetic
coma, and insulin overdose, and
also when giving blood.

In other words, I would have
hada much higher chance of faint-
ing had I given blood last Wednes-
day than someone whose blood
pressure appeared normal that day.

“High blood pressure” is de-
fined as diastolic > 90 mm. Hg. It
is associated with hypertensive
heart disease and stroke. There are
many causes of high blood pres-
sure, among them “organic” fac-
tors such as kidney disorders and
thyroid and pituitary gland dis-
eases.

External factors include a diet
high in saturated fat, salt, and alco-

hol. High stress, a sedentary life-
Style, and obesity also can contrib-
ute tohigh blood pressure. Hered-
ity too, can be an important factor
in determining whether a person
has high or low blood pressure.

there is only one, our decision was
not a difficult one.

Located just off Main Street
very close to the post office, The
Backstreet Café offers basic stan-
dard food. :

We split an appetizer of Pick-
and-Peel Shrimp ($7.50), mainly

because it was the most expensive -

appetizer on the menu because The
Davidsonian was picking up the
tab. Eventually a very small plate
of tasteless shrimp arrived with an
equally tasteless cucumber dip.
. For $7.50 we had expected a.
Bucket O’Shrimp, served on  sil-
ver platter by one of Queen Eliza-
beth’s personal footmen.
For the main entree, my fellow
editor tried the Chicken Breast
Sandwich ($5.95), which boasted
Jack cheese, cucumber sauce and
steak fried. It was declared pass-
able, but the sauce was tasteless,
Every restaurant hasa chicken
breast sandwich, we noted, and

better than most.

I decided to raise my choles-
terol level by ordering the Spinach
Omelette filled with Fresh Fruit,
which turned out to be a fairly
_ generous omelette filled with fresh

spinach.

Overall, the food
is passable and the
service fairly
slow.

But it was nothing I couldn’t
have made in my own kitchen in
about ten minutes. They used no
special sauces or spices to liven up
the plain spinach filling.

And though there fruit did ac-
company the meal, it was merely a
few slices of banana and a few
slices of apple, which reminded
me of what my mother threw in my
lunchbox when I was late for
school.
