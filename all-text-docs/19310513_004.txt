Book Review

The Christian Belief in Immortality in the
Light of Modern Thought. By James H.
Snowden. The Macmillan Company, New
York. (Library New Book List.)

The vast accumulation of knowledge in re-
cent years, the liberality of thought given
Scripture, and the tolerance of varying inter-
pretations—all the product of the scientific
era in thought and thought method—-have
called forth a frank discussion, scientifically,
of the vital question of immortality.

The doctrine of life after death is time-
old, and belief in it has so long been shared
by the majority of mankind. Pagan and
Christian alike, though differing in concepts
of the present life, have universally accepted
the continuation of the soul’s life in the fu-
ture world.

But just what and where is the soul?
Ancients have ascribed it a definite place in
the brain, agnostics have of course denied its
existence, while modern thought construes it
as personality itself, the Ego in man.

Dr. Snowden’s book is a presentation of
the grounds of belief in immortality on nat-
ural, religious, and Christian grounds. On
natural grounds, the soul, the essence of per-
sonality, is a continuing entity, existing be-
fore and after this life. Considered in: that
light the soul has Simply lodged itself in a
physical body, working in conjunction with
and guiding it. What reason is there to
believe that its existence will be cut off with
the physical body containing it?

The most powerful objection to immortal-
ity, says Dr. Snowden, is the dependence of
the soul on the body as though the two came

into. existence and perished together,~-But

this concept is undermined. by the fact of
the soul’s mastery over the body.. When a
telegraph instrument stops sparking the op-
erator does not stop thinking.

The religious argument for immortality
is its deep-rootedness in man’s nature, It is
an instinct in man’s heart prompted by his
recognition of the incompleteness of the soul
and of the world.

The Christian’s strongest argument for
immortality is, of course, the Bible. “Let not
your heart be troubled: ye believe in God,
believe also in me. In my Father’s house are
many mansions: if it were not so I would
have told you. 1 go to prepare a place for
you.” This and Christ’s other allusions to
“another home” coupled with natural and
normal religious faith in a hereafter consti-
tute the foundation of the Christian belief.

Material. and symbolic proof of a here-
after was presented in Christ’s own #esur-
rection from the grave. The agnostic’s cry
that his resurrection was illusory to the

disciples is convincingly refuted by Dr.|
Snowden. in his chapter on “The Christian |
Grounds of Belief.” “Such illusions and de- |
lusions can grow up only in minds that al- |
ready have some obsession or possession, in
their favor they demand original soil and |
propitious circumstances. Nothing of the
kind but quite the contrary existed in the |
case of the disciples. While Jesus ‘had spoken |
to them of His resurrection, yet they seem |
not to have understood Him, and no such |
expectation was in their minds. His death |
was a disaster wholly unexpected by them
and was at once followed by the utter col- |
lapse of all their hopes.” The disciples, espe-
cially Thomas, had to be convinced of
Christ’s rising, such was their doubt.

The feasibility of immortality is demon-
strated in chapter 8 in which Dr. Snowden
states that the doctrine has won the assent
of scientific minds, that it has been con-
firmed by spirit communications, that it has
stood the test of the great war and is prac-
tical for every-day life. The conviction can
be strengthened by intellectual reasoning,
but actual belief is born and nourished in
the heart. The Christian’s stand is faith. The
alternative of immortality is pessimism.

Dr. Smowden’s book, which won the
$1,000 prize offered by “The Churchman”
for the best paper on the subject, is a mas-
tegful and scholarly exposition. The author
quotes frequently from poets.

way to get spirituality is to get it by your-
self, but Mrs. Glasgow thinks the spiritual
atmosphere of this campus refutes this be-
lief. She related the story about one of her
friends who decided to be a minister. When
he was reminded of the trials he would face,
he answered, “Who wants an ‘easy job?”

The speaker said that control is another
thing that shouldbe developed, because peo-
ple without it are unreliable. She quoted the
passage, “He that ruleth his own spirit is
greater than he that taketh a city.” Com-
paring a wild, spirited horse that is use-
less ,to a strong, well-trained, useful horse,
Mrs. Glasgow ended by asking her hearers,
merely harmless strength. Consecration was
affirmed as another factor necessary in a
four-square man, She explained the differ-
ence between morality and spirituality and
stressed the moral, mental ,and physical side
of life’ She told how David Livingstone’s
true worth was proven by his decision to
remain in Africa when his life was in dan-
ger. Giving the example of a small boy who
informed his mother during the World War
that if he were old enough to go to fight, he
wouldn’t, because there would be lots of
other things he would want to do. She added

it urge him on, and lay continuing and last-
ing and joyful stress on the subject which
will make him go deeper into it than the
mere page of his book.

“This thing will make him see all the
imagery and symbolism of his math smatics,
the vast underlying movement and currents
of history, the living and pregnant power of
words, rather than the drudgery which ‘is
all too common to these things. These things
will add immeasurably to the subject, and
will give it those things which will last.
Hard to judge in terms of grades, or units,
I grant you, but far more important,” added
the speaker.

“T would,” Dr. Rondthaler concluded,” that
at the threshold of each new adventure in
education for every man, this ‘spirit of im-
agination kindled’ would stand, urgent, rich,
earnest, sincere, pointing the way on to the
real and important things to be learned.”

Immediately preceding the public address,
the formal initiation of the new men was
held, and at the close of the speech, a ban-
quet for the new initiatives and old mem-
bers was laid in the banquet hall of Cham-
bers Building.

Men honored with membership in this
fraternity included Dr. Rondthaler, himself,
of Winston-Salem, and Profs. K. J. Fore-
man and C. K. Brown, and Lieut.-Col. W.
R. Scott, members of the Davidson faculty.
The following students were also initiated:
