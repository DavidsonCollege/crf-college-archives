ers of the old tottering gym.

no matter who he is, has the mentality of an

knows a lot more about his woris than the
tirst man to criticize. He does his best, and
he is human.

, Brain Polish...

A former Chiet Justice of the Supreme
Court of Maine, himscli a graduate of a
great university, onee said: “in the case of a
large institution. more boys go through the
i_ college: while in a small college, more col-
lege goes through the boys. The persona!
‘actor is the maior clement in every college
education. .

“To rub a brain with other braims,” said a
sage. “is the very best form ot polish.” and
the quality of this polish will depend upon
the quality of the individuals with whom a
student comes in contact. The type of man
—protessor or tellow student) with whom
he will associate is a prime consideration to
cvery prospective student and his parcats.

Your Talent...

You may be a one-talent mani, but.a taree-
——tilent man, ora tiveatalent man, but if you

fellow students they may never Know. it, or
even suspect it.

‘In times ‘yot so long past, Davidson stu-
dents had an opportunity to display their
tafents in a svunt night, a highlight of stu-
__ deat acuivicy. Now no such opportunity
exists. In tdst schools and colleges today
this same idea is carried ou in some form
or other, The latest trend, an offspring of
the broathway musieal comedy. is the col-
lege musical, through which a great deal of
talent has been diseovered.

Nothing as extravagant as these periorm-
ances could ever be attempted a1 Davidson,
but there is certainty enough dramatic and
musical talent fo merit something of the
sor. With the backing of Red and Black
Masquers and the dramatic frateraity,

Alpha Psi Omega, the old “stunt nite” could
certainly be revised and the student body
given an oppertunity to exercise its talents.

“LITTLE MAN — WHAT NOW?”

It comes at least once a ate life of every
college man, usually-at the beginning of his
last semester. Suddenly
the realization bursts |

upon him that the easy -
going routine of eat-
ing. Sleeping. studying. |
and playing is soon to
be no morez that he'll
have to punch, a time-
clock which doesn al-
low three cuts instead
of catthing that first
period class; that his
iniendships, bound together in a community
t
|

of similar interests, will soon be broken up:
that, in brief, the old stage on which he has
been saying his lines will be pulled down
to make way for a new one with diferent
scenery and a new role.

It is usually then that he begins to look
hackward over his college career and tries
to evaluate his accomplishments. Thev may
have been many, they may have been few.
\With apologies to Percy Marks, he may
have been a ‘big frog in a little puddle” or
a tadpole in the occan. But regardless of his
eminence on the campus. he stil undergoes
a shuddef of stage fright whieh eomes,to
every actor when he contemplates a uew
performance. Will the audience demand an
after-curtain appearance, or wil the show
told up?

ti is then that the average college man
realizes the mistakes he’s made, the things |
he should have done, the channels into
which he shoiildchave directed Nis talents.
It’s too late, and:he turns a questioning.
glance on a Future which still remains dark.
What will it bring him? Time can only tell.
But mixed with his dismay and uncertainty
is a tempting desire to pull his younger fel-
low students to one side and say to them:
“Work hard and play hard, but take advan-
tage of every opportunity college life offers
you, for its tough to realize it’s just about
all over.” °

SUNDAY SCHOOL
ATTENDANCE INCREASES...
Dear Dick.

The month of January with its
examinations is ordinarily — filled
with more work than usual for
Davidson students. Vet the attend-
ance at the Sunday morning Stu-
dent Sunday School class has stead-
ily increased, resulting in average
attendance of nearly 100 during the
four Sundays of January. This
splendid attendanee is due ehietly
to two reasons. One is the faithiul
and perststent efiort on the pari
of Marion Bryant, president of the

enlighteaing talks givens by Dr.
Gwynn, who has been teaching for
the past four Sundays. He has taik—
ed on the threats of Nazism. Ias-
cism, and Communism to Christian
liberty. concluding with a testimony
of his own personal faith in Christ.
Tas etass has heard him with in-
tense intefest? and great profit, and
we are grgtefil to him for taking
time trom his strenuous duties to
talk to us.

We are told thal more talks tha:
are Umely and helpful will be given
during the next semester. There
are still great numbers of students |
who are failing to attend these ¢
services, and it is hoped that this
article will help to impress upon |
them their loss in not attending. — {|

The cfiort will be made this se-
mester to secure an attendance of
3a). and L-for one believe it can

be done

A list of study hints for students

who are tiréd of feverishly rushing :

through belated assignments has
been prepared by Prof. Warren T.
Powell, head of the department of
student counseling at Boston Uni-
versity. They include:

1. Work under pressure; set a
deadline inside of which work must
be accomplished.

2. Make yourself rise above petty
distractions; when they come, ac-
cept them, then go back to your
studying without losing your stride.

3. Assume that you are liable for
an account of all you are study-
ing.

4. Maintain an alert questioning

A New Deal — A story is going
the rounds to the effect that a gov-

fights murned

ernment investigator visited a farny

in order’ to list all the property and
put a valuation on vt. He had a little
book of instructions telling him
how to estimate the value of all
the different classes of animais and
articles. Im the course oi his sur-
vey he encountered a creature
which apparently was not listed in
any of the categories, although the
thing resembled a goat. Perplexed,
he wired Washington for special
instructions, as follows

A few hours later he received this
reply from Washington :

“We are of the opinion that the
animal you describe is a, farmer.
and has no value.”

being described this ume comes
from “God's country.” the hills of
Fast Tennessee. He has been at
Davidson more years than I care
to say and is known by every mem-
‘ber of the student body. He in
turn, knows the names of Davidson
students but has diificulty in re-
