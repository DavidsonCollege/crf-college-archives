LOCK YOUR

DOORS

To the editor:

Welcome to the land of intellectual
fantasy. A virtual Camelot of gothic
structure. A place where lights burn til
sunrise as brilliant young minds battle
for the gallant knight adorned in tweed
jacket and tie.

Every banker’s son and debutante
daughter sparkles on their own stage as
they grapple with the complex structure
of the academic world in such an inno-
cent way. All seem so bound by study
and the inviolable “honor code” that
reality will never-enter the fortreess un-
til graduation, But the walls of David-
son’s fortress do not exist, and the honor
code no matter how noble, (if not
laughed at by outsiders) is summarily
ignored. I say émphatically, that Reality
cannot be ignored! ‘] am‘an outsider. So
you assume I am ignorant of the stipwla-
tions of the honor code. I know enough
of Davidson rules to say with conviction
that the honor code breeds a false sense
of security. For example, a student is
seen stealing a test to review for a late
test he must take. The guilty student is
sent to the honor council who. passes
ther judgement. All very proper and ju-
dicial. The integrity of Davidson is up-
held. All is well in Camelot. But let’s

take the honor code a little further, if
each student is bound to report dishon- ::

est acts committed by another student
then you shouldn’t have to lock doors or
keep up with your wallet because any
assault or robbery will certainly be seen
and reported. But what about the “‘pea-
sants” of the real world? The people
who don’t belong to the family of Da-
vidson.

The walls of Davidson unlike those of
Camelot, consist of Concord and Moo-
resville highways each lined by a two
foot wall (not very stout barriers, except
to very small people). WAKE UP
FOLKS! Davidson is an educational
fantasy/nightmare (depending on the
time of day and the weight of the book)
but you have to realize the honor code is
only functional with the Davidson stu-
dent. LOCK YOUR DOORS! You can
enjoy your college career without the
sobering reality of rape or burglary to
mar your life. Use the honor code with
all its nobility to its written limit, and
your common sense to its fullest extent.

Sincerely,
a commoner

To the Editor:

On 19 October 1982 during the reg-
ular Military Science lab, the Davidson
ROTC Department hosted a Range Fire.
The Davidsow ‘envite
tributes to the conteptual development
of a leader. Such events as the Range
Fire contribute to the practical develop-
ment of an officer’s expertiese, “the
management of violence.”

nt often con-:

Cadets from Davidson and Catawba
Colleges ‘received instruction on famil-
iarization and operation of the M-60
machine gun and the .45 caliber pistol.
Cadets then fired live ammunition at sil-
houette targets from these weapons and
the M-16A1 rifle, the primary weapon
of the infantry soldier.

Cadet 1LT Paul Griffith, Officer in
Charge of the Range Fire, insured that
all training was conducted safely and ef-
ficiently. .

Submit

Dear editor:..

Hi Carl. Hi Ed. Gosh, I sure was upset
to hear that you guys have so much crea-
tivity on hand and no avenue through
which it can be seen, heard, or what
have you. There must be no end to your
frustration.

Of course, the Davidsonian re-
sponded to the huge public demand; |
understand that there will be a literary
supplement in two weeks.

Gosh, that sure is spiffy news. Still,
with all the work you guys have there
would probably have to be ten literary
supplements to cover it all.

Well I have the solution to your prob-
lem. Did you know that Hobart Park is
accepting submissions from now until
November 8? What’s more, we are
committed to meeting all of your crea-
tive needs. If you don’t write poetry, but
rather an original computer program for
generating art, send it in. Of course poe-
try is great, along with prose, artwork,
photography, intaglio, whatever you
think is worth “public expression.”

Remember, guys, the deadline is No-
vember 8. That leaves only two weeks
for that literary/artistic genius to be he-
ralded throughout the Davidson com-
munity. Hey, if you do submit, either
mail your wotk to P.O.: Box 4167, Or
drop it by:Canon 209. va

Selah!

To the Editor:

Before it’s too late, I want to express
a concern over the planning of the new
athletic facility. Duncan Fraser's recent
article in The Davidsonian points out
the various sections of the facility and
what sports would be located in each,
including track, tennis, gymnastics,
basketball, volleyball, and racquetball.
What? No squash courts?

Perhaps the planners and architects
don’t realize that squash courts and rac-
quetball courts are quite different. You
simply can’t play a.real game of squash
on a racquetball court, There are squash
players in Davidson, students and facul-
ty alike, all in love with one of the fas-
test, most enjoyable, and fastest-grow-
ing racquet sports in the world, yet all
stifled because Davidson has no squash
courts.

I'd like to know if the Office of
Development has looked into the possi-
bility of squash courts in the new facili-
ty. I'd hate to see a 5.5 million dollar
project neglect to do so.
