We knew that we were in the

right place when we bought our

tickets — a framed picture of us
atop his motorcycle sat on the ticket
table. We-were freshmen then,
new roommates, and we had just
seen Renelvis for the first time.
Now we are seniors, and Saturday
night we went to see him for the
last time.

The 50’s dance is often over-
looked by those who think they are
too cool. They are missing out.

Where else can you find the
English Department dancing in
leather jackets? President

Kukyendall doing the Macarena?

Elvis lives!

Dean Shandley wearing sunglasses
at night? A Filipino Elvis
impersinator who sings in not only
English but Greek?

He didn’t sing in Greek on
Saturday, but he still gave us a
great show.

Born in the Philippenes,
RenElvis sings the hits of the King
like Liberace would sing the blues.
But you don’t notice the incongru-
ity of his accent while you watch
him sing in his gold and white
outfit and blinking-light belt. You
don’t compare him to Elvis. You
love him for who he is.

We loved him so much fresh-
man year that we called his fan
club number. Ren himself an-

swered and was thrilled that we
were fans. We soon got a RenElvis

package in the mail — included
with membership was at-shirt with
a RenElvis decal and a tape of his
greatest hits. An information
packet included the names of all of
his fan club members (Carrie is
#9).

Rarely do you see so many
different facets of the Davidson
community come together. Pro-
fessors dance with their sons and
daughters, elementary school chil-
dren compete in the dance contest,
high schoolers flirt, and college
students help run the show. And
when the Filipino King comes out
on stage, the entire crowd goes
crazy.

RenElvis does it like no one
can.

La Macarena: Right, the crowd goes crazy. Left, Sefiora de Espaiiol Magdalena Maiz-Peia baila

Abandon all reason,

Faculty art exhibit explores fascinations with the past, the mina, and the insane

The faculty art exhibit at the
Van Every Gallery provided me
with my first exposure to art at
Davidson. Debra Fisher, a
printmaker and new member of
the art faculty, presented her works
in the Van Every gallery. I really
connected with her prints which
involve a deep and personal ele-
ment.

Symbolism plays a key role in
her art, with religious themes in-
volving life, nature, and death.
Each work had a spirit of its own to
which I could relate.

Her main exhibition, Print/
Book Installation and Mixed Me-
dia Works, encompasses the pas-
sage of time through visual memo-
ries of people close to the artist. I

saw her work as a look to the past,
surrounded by pain, love, and
peace.

As I moved into the next sec-
tion of the gallery, I was intro-
duced to the sculptures of Cort
Savage. His works in the Silence
and Stillness and The Sleep of Rea-
son exhibitions impressed me by
his use of kinetics. His sculptures
give a sense of timelessness and
peace which contrast with his use
of physical movement. He puts
compassion into his work andcom-
pares form with continuity.

’ Savage uses such materials as
apiano, the wings ofa finch, bronze
drawings, and placement of sand
to appeal to the senses of the viewer,
not only visually but also audibly.

I then entered the painting
world of Herb Jackson, a world
composed of radiant color and ex-

pression. His series of Small Oil
Painting are personified with feel-
ing. He feels that his paintings are
a metaphor for life. Their
unpredictability and failure lead to
new beginnings.

He starts with nothing and as
he creates the painting, he commu-
nicates with it until it eventually
resolves itself.

Jackson says that his works do
not necessarily mean anything in
particular, but they do have vari-
ous layers and scraping shown in
the art. I saw his works as visual
interpretations of his mind, truly
stunning and internal.

As I left the exhibit, I was
overcome with a greater apprecia-
tion of art and its place at Davidson.
I encourage others to take the time

‘to view these works and respond to

them in their own way.
