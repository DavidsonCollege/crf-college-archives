School no longer
recycling? Rumor
proves unfounded

It’s often said that nothing travels at the
speed of gossip. That certainly seemed true
last week when the rumor that Davidson is no
longer recycling swept through the campus at
an almost unnatural rate.

“T heard they just leave the bins out so
people think they’re recycling, but they really
just throw it away with the garbage,” said one
of the many concerned students who con-
tacted the Davidsonian.

College President Bobby Vagt was puzzled
when he heard the rumor.

“TI certainly hope that’s not the case,” he
said, pointing out that the school budgets
$22,000 for its recycling program.

“I know one load over the summer had to
be thrown away because it was contaminated
with non-recyclable materials. Maybe that’s
what they heard about.”

A call to Barbara Zaoinz, the Assistant
Director of Building Services, sorted out the
matter. ““That’s news to me,” said a startled
Zaoinz. ;

“T personally checked the 20 recycling bins
around campus and they are being used and
used correctly. My staff continues to collect
recycling from all buildings.”

Zaoinz added, “We even expanded the
program by placing paper bins in classrooms
in an effort to capture more paper from end-
ing up in the trash. Last month we recycled
5,330 pounds of cardboard...double the
amount of any previous month.”

Soenvironmentally-conscious students and
visitors can rest easy — contrary to popular
belief, recycling at Davidson is still alive and
well.

More renovations

in the works for
Chambers, pipes

Construction, from page 1

will add a door directly facing the E. H. Little
Library and create more access to Richardson
Plaza.

There are plans to replace much of the
brick on Richardson Plaza with grass.
Holthouser and his team believe that “green
is good.” They are reducing the number of
diagonal walkways by four and have pledged

to plant three trees for every tree that falls or

has to be removed.

When renovation is complete, Chambers
will feature 97 faculty offices, 35 classrooms,
three lounges and many other spaces. The
project is expected to cost around $20 mil-
lion, which comes from endowments, not
student tuition.

There are also plans underway to upgrade
the utilities on campus. In August 2002, an
electrical substation will be positioned on
campus to minimize the chance of power
outages.

There are plans to build a new steam plant
and install new steam pipes as the need for
becomes greater due to the increase in the size
of the campus. A chilled water plant was built
to centralize the air conditioning of the col-
lege. This will greatly minimize noise pollu-
tion around campus. It will also increase the
efficiency of distributing chilled water.

Underground work is heavy as electrical
and telecommunication lines, and steam and
water pipes are being built. Brick pathways
are being built to replace asphalt pathways,
under the logic that brick is porous and allows
for water to get to the soil underneath. The
project is estimated to cost around $14 mil-
lion.
