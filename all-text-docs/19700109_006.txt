Rusk To Begin

Managing Editor

Dean Rusk, a Davidson
graduate and former Secre-
tary of State under two
presidents, has accepted a
position as a professor of in-
ternational law at the Uni-
versity of Georgia in Athens.

His acceptance came after
two weeks of controversy
among the University of
Georgia Board of | Regents
over his nomination. They
eventually approved his ap-
pointment by a nine to four
vote.

The controversy was _ initi-
ated by Georgia Governor
Lester G. Maddox and by
