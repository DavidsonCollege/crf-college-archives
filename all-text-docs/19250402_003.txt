Williamson—“This cold weather chills me |
to the bone.”
McConnell—"You should wear a hat.”

Fresh Guthery—"Dearest, do you think
you could ever love a fellow like me?”
She—"If he wasn't too much like you.”

One day as I chanced to pass,

A beaver was damning a river;

And Goat Harris, who had run out of gas,
Was doing the same to his flivver.

Prot.—"There now, Mr. Lawson, just keep
that in mind and you will have it in a nut-
shell.”

A bit of blank verse by Charley Hunter :
“Gather your kisses while you may,

Time brings only sorrow;
For the flappers who flap so freely today,

Are the chaperones of tomorrow.”

“This is quite the cow's hips,” said Pinkey
Johnson, as he bit into the boarding-house
steak,

“Gentlemen,” quoth one of our well-known
Profs., “for the next lesson, “begin where
we leit off today, and get down to where we
will start the following time.”

Franklin—"Number, thunder, you had het-

He—"What do you think, girlie, I'm out
for spring practice!”

She—"Oh, Charley, ain't that lovely. How
far can you spring?"

Root-—"This picture is entitled ‘Fleas.’ "
Beer—"‘No doubt by one of our famous
modern etchers,”

Hunt—"Where'd you buy the new. suit
cases ?”

Joyner—-"They're not ‘suitcases; they are
my new pair of shoes.”

Grandpa—"What did you draw, just now,

liegle Emmalina ?”

Emmalina—"I started to draw a_ picture
of you, but it didn’t look exactly like you,
so I put a tail on it and called it a dog.”

Suggestion to Simp Bryant: The way to
get more cheering out of the students is to
give them root beer before the game.

No, no, Isabel, they won't let half-sisters

“Rastus, ['m sorry to hear you've buried

“Boss, I jes had to—she was dead.”

The melancholy days have come,
The saddest of our annals;
It's far too cold for B. V. D.'s,
And for too hot for flannels.

J. Doy Young, after waiting for all these

years for the opportune moment, made his

regret, however, that Mr. Young's immediate

exit is being considered on account of the
high price of seats at the New Broadway

Davidson was very fortunate in getting
