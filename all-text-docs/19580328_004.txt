ifree to express their opinions,

GEORGE RAMSEY

If given the opportunity to
edit the DAVIDSONIAN next
year, I will try to present each
week an inclusive, informative,
attractive panorama of David-
son College.

This will include an alive, un-
biased reporting of news on the
front and back pages, a provoc-
ative editorial page providing
an open channel for expression
of student opinion, and an ac:
curate, readable sports depart-
ment.

NEWS

The keynote of the paper will
be clear, accurate concise news
accounts that reach into every
corner of the campus. with the
accent on coming events. I fa-
vor continuing the frequent
luncheon interviews with prom-
inent members of the faculty
and administration, a very preg-
nant source of real news.

“A picture’ is worth a thou-
sand words.” Through knowl-
edgeable use of photographs
the newspaper editor can make
the difference between a
“dead” page and one that
jumps out at the reader. I
strongly favor wide use of the
camera to report the campus
scene.

EDITORIAL POLICY

On the editorial page the DA-
VIDSONIAN will reflect a defi-
nite stand of the editors on
vital campus issues, and on
those non-campus matters which
warrant attention. The Letters
to the Editor shall continue to
voice the feelings of the student
body.

while only 10% placed the sec-

LAURENS WALKER

There must be blood in the
veins of a newspaper and air
in its lungs before it can call
itself a good paper.

A newspaper must be the in-
formant, the companion, the ad-
visor, the defender, and the
confessor of its readers. It must
be alive and thinking. It must
propose action and be willing to
act on its own. Finally, a good
newspaper must be willing to
stake its very existence on the

belief that it has the right to/-,

be heard.
