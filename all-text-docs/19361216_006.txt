Weak Frosh Lose To

Strong Senior Team

In the first contest of the inter-
class basketball series a strong sen-
ior team swamped the hapless and
unorganized freshmen by a 50-17
score.

The Centennials were led by Cap-
tain Bankhead with fourteen points
while Faison and Anderson each
accounted for 10 counters. Joyner,
although playing only part of the
game, led the losers with 7 points
followed by King and Rhegsdale

with 4 each. The seniors took the
lead from the beginning and were
never pushed as they scored almost
at will. They will offer stiff com-
petition for the juniors and sophs
and will be right in the race for the
class championship.

NOTE: Dr. Crane, '07 in irg

A. Chr $s Gift Fand
“First of all, I wish to express

sincere and hearty appreciation to

the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet for
warm response to the request that
the students’ ex

their
ntributions this year
go toward the completion of the
for the light plant at Mutoto

Station

C

funds
for lighting the Morrison

Bible School and the hospital

“Some years ago the need for
a light plant at Mutoto became so
acutely apparent, a careful survey
was made of the available water

r was hoped that a

1 plant could be erected whic

would furnish both lights and water
aati However,

certain factor.

The Hospital at Mutoto, as in
l Mission
\trica, provides a work that chai-
lenges the full

Hospitals in

efforts of Dr. and

Mr -y Smith, with the native
int (nurses). This building
is no | ing facilities whatever
nda few kerosene lanterns, the
doctor and nurse having to find
t Wer at night with a

Klight. With the funds now on

hand, together with the students’

ion, it~may be possible not

only to provide the lights for the
Hospital and Bible School, but a
small X-ray equipment for the Hos-
ital as well

“It is only to. add that
er loyal Davidson alum-

necessary

ssion will join with me

gratitude to the students

r gift this year to Africa.”
