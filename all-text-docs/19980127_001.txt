SGA President Jesse Coleman
Burk, a.k.a. Buster, has never done any-
thing according to precedent.

Just look at his wardrobe — an
animated, sometimes blinding, array of
colors and patterns.

Just listen to his voice-mail mes-
sage — a vintage Buster-esque Elvis
rendition.

And just watch him run an SGA
meeting — by his own admittance, the
formalities of parliamentary procedure
are not his strong suit.

So it’s no surprise that Burk, who
will deliver a State of the School Ad-
dress tonight as his term enters its final
weeks, ran Davidson student govern-
ment in his own way over the past year,
straying from the more rigid style of his
predecessors, Bill Gullan and Warren
Buford.

“Warren was a very determined

individual,” Burk said in an interview.

last week. “He knew what he wanted to
do and he accomplished his goals. As
well as with Bill, but I think to a lesser
degree.

“I didn’t follow an agenda that had
been set months in advance. That’s
neither good nor bad. That’s just differ-
ent.”

Shortly after he was elected, Burk
told the Davidsonian that “helping and
asking people’s opinions” allowed him
‘to continually earn campus political
success, pointing to his role as class
president his freshman and sophomore
years. 2

Indeed.

“T think that Buster has been a very ~

thoughtful president,” said senior Mat-
thew Hobbie, who will soon step down
from his post as Union Board president.
“He takes everyone’s view into ac-
count.”

“T have marveled at his facility at

moving a meeting along,” President
Bobby Vagt said, “pushing disparate

“opinions here, urging compromise

there.”

“He was very much a people’s
president,” added Ann Harriot Fisher,
who served as vice president under Burk
and ran for president in the most recent
elections, which were held yesterday.
“He was so open to listening to what
everybody else wanted to do.”

Added Junior Class President Chris
Tuttle: “He’s very accessible and very
friendly. He goes. around and asks
people what they think.”

What Burk certainly didn’t do,

though, was emphasize particular per- *

sonal aims or policies. Rather, he sim-
ply attempted to listen to student senti-
ment — and then go from there, wher-
ever that would potentially take the
SGA.

The efficacy of such a strategy
was questioned throughout Burk’s tim
as president. :

. “He. was very open to people’s
ideas,” Hobbie said, “but I didn’t think

there were very. many of his own.”

“The common man motif is great
to run on and it works,” said Indepen-
dent Senator Jesse Smallwood, a sopho-
more. “But when it comes to legisla-
tion, something else is often needed.”

Tronically, though, the byproducts
of Burk’s laissez-faire attitude —
whether actually intended or not —
may prove to be his administration’s
greatest legacy, as it thrust the power
back into the SGA Senate, its various
committees, and ultimately, the stu-
dents.

“The committee system has been
really successful,” Burk said. ‘That’s
been exciting.”

Last semester, the Solidarity Com-
mittee painted the construction wall by
the Union. And COMA — Council on
Minority Affairs — is organizing the
upcoming Diversity Week celebrations

after five or six years of relative inac-
tivity.

In short, Burk, precisely by not
setting a specific point-A-to-point-B
agenda, created a more open SGA.

“He had a lack of direction, but
that’s what he wanted,” said Senior
Class President Tim Saintsing. “It gave

senators more control. Each individual '

senator was setting the agenda.
“His policies, or lack thereof, made
me realize that you can still get the job

Salute to a term well spent

done with individual senators. He threw
a lot of power to the senators, which I
think is an awesome thing. That’s what
his administration brought about, and
I’m appreciative of that.”

As Dean of Students Tom Shandley
said, “Buster, in my mind, is an enabler.
He has enabled a lot of other people in
student government to rise up and take
on leadership roles.” :

“It’s not my SGA,” Burk ex-
plained. “Somebody might take that

attitude, but it’s not mine. I’m not like
a CEO, mote like a head producer. It’s
not like I did all this stuff.”

But the Burk administration did
accomplish many of its tangible goals.

The Vamanos Van, originally
Buford’s idea, came to fruition this year.

The Kiosk, a place to hang flyers
in a more organized manner, will likely
be built after Burk is already out of

Diversity Week to facilitate interaction beyond boundaries

By Scott GEIGER
Staff Writer

Into the second semester of its
most active and promising year, the
Committee on Minority Affairs
(COMA) is sponsoring Diversity Week,
Jan. 26-31.

Although COMA has been anSGA
committee for five years, this is the first
year Davidson College will celebrate
Diversity Week with events ranging
from a movie night to an International
Café at the Outpost to a Diversity Fo-
rum with Assistant Chaplain Brenda
Tapia.

“The committee has worked long
and hard to address the needs of the
Davidson student body,” says Allen

Lee, Chairman of COMA, “and we
hope that Diversity Week will begin to
find the answers to the questions that
we all have.

“It is imperative that all members
of the Davidson family realize how
important it is to effectively utilize the
diversity we have on this campus.” Lee
also would like to clarify that Diversity
Week is not just about race or ethnic
blood but also different sexual orienta-
tions and the entire spectrum of socio-
economic backgrounds that coexist on
the Davidson campus.

An event called “Dorm Storm”
kicked off Diversity week on Monday
at 9 p.m. Dorm Storm involved groups
of three or four volunteers meeting with
each hall.

The Dorm Storm hall meetings
were expected to last approximately 15
minutes, during which the volunteers
listed and explained the schedule of
events for Diversity Week.

Today, Jumpin’ Java takes a twist
as International Café takes cover the
Union Outpost. The night will feature
an open microphone for those who wish
to read poetry or give their thoughts on
the many facets of diversity. Also,
international coffees will be available
at no cost.

Wednesday promises to differ
somewhat from the rest of the week. On
this day COMA will ask students and
faculty to step outside of their comfort
zones to take up the Campus Question,
“How do we improve interactions be-

tween different worlds (such as ethnic,
sexual, racial, and social)?”

“Many times we overlook or ig-
nore the difficulties we have with
people,” says Lee. “Beginning Wednes-
day and every day thereafter, we want
the student body to start to overlook
these difficulties and begin to politely

‘question and observe, because we all

have something to learn from one an-
other.”

COMA hopes that the Campus
Question will help initiate discussion in
halls and classrooms.

Wednesday’s Ask Yourself...
hopes to pique student minds as a prepa-
ration for Thursday’s showing of “The
Color of Fear.” The film begins at 8
p.m. at the Union Outpost and is spon-

“He fulfilled every single campaign promise he had. He just told us that he was going to listen to everybody. And-he did.”

Refreshments will follow the film, along
with a discussion led by Assistant Dean
of Students and Director of Minority
Student Affairs Ernest Jeffries.
