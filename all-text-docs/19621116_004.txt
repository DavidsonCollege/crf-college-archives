; “I wanted to see what it was like at a small college,” says Dr. W. H. Tilley, Dav-
idson’s newest addition to the English department.

in 1962 he organized a
group of professors in an or-
ganization whose basic prin.
ciple was that “no two mem-
bers could be of the same dis-
cipline.” Although he likes
the variety large universities
offer, he feels that they often
limit themselves by a lack of
communication between their
departments.

So now he has come to David-
son to see what the small col-
lege has to offer and how it
works. When prodded for some
of his first impressions, he said

“Let me start by saying I
came here to find these things
out and certainly haven't made
up my mind yet. However, I
have. made some tentative ob-
servations. Small colleges seem
to be strong in the field of pre-
medical, pre-ministerial, and
pre-law courses of study, but
weak in fields of the arts and
scienees. This lack of variety

the student in making decisions.

“At large universities, on
the other hand, there is a
much greater variety of things
going on; constantly new
ideas are being formulated,
and new things are being
done.

“Therefore the large university
seems to attract the creative
minds. There is a hunger on
this campus to have contact with
the world where ideas are be-
ing made instead of just being
passed on.”

But, taking a different point
of view, Tilley has yet another
interesting opinion about edu-
cation at Davidson: “Education
has become a ‘commodity,’ not
just an interest of the cultural-
ly elite as it used to be. So we
have the problem of mass edu-
eation and. the problem of how
to educate the culturally elite
to a greater degree of excel-
lence than the ordinary student.

Approximately fifty students attended an eleventh
hour pacifist rally in front of the Cunningham Fine Arts
Building last Sunday night, precipitated by William F.
Goodykoontz, Davidson English professor, and ten David-

|
|

son students.

The participants first appear-
ed in costumes as deformed or
wounded persons. Goodykoontz
appeared, also suitably disguis-
ed, and stated the purpose of
the rally. Various poems, por-
tions of stories, and a part of a
play were read. These, pointed
up the futility and evil of war.

The rally dismissed and re-
convened inside the Fine Arts
Building, where the crowd
dwindled to about 30. The read-
ings continued. Eventually as
the crowd grew smaller, Goody-
koontz invited the onlookers
to take part. The rally finally
broke: up at 12:45 p.m.

The audience was originally
attracted by a weird crowd of
apparently deformed figures,
milling about in front of the
Fine Arts Building. Eerie
strains of music accompanied
their appearance.

The group of spectators
watched for some ten or fifteen
minutes. when Goodykoontz '‘ap-
peared. With a pasty face and
great black hollows under his
eyes, he too presented some-
thing of an unnatural figure.

Goodykoontz recalled the day
when Armistice Day emphasiz-
ed peace. He spoke of an Ameri-
can officer who served in World
War L This officer, John Me-
Crae, wrote a poem which
Goodykoontz briefly quoted. “If
ye break faith with we who die,
we shall not sleep.” The speak-
er seemed to feel that we have
not kept the faith.

One outstanding portion was
presented. by a character dress-

ed as an army officer but with
an ape’s face. He presented cer-

tain scenes from novelist Aldous

Huxley’s book, Ape and Es-
sence.

Reading both the stage di-
rections and the actor’s parts,
he presented an effective fig-
ure, jumping up and down
and screaming “Disloyal!”,
“Unpatriotic’, and “Filthy
communist.” He held Einstein
on a teash, symbolizing the
use of science by the base
elements in man.

Another striking presentation
appeared in the form of a. set
of Siamese twins, joined from
shoulder to foot. They read a
poem, “I Sing. of Olaf” Olaf, a
peaceful citizen. is drafted. He
protests and is forced to fight.
On his refusal to fight, he is
thrown into prison and_ dies
there.

A one armed student read
portions of Catech-22, a recent
novel. He read of a bomber
flight during World War II.
While returning from the mis-
sion, the plane ran into some
flak. One of the crew was seve-
rely wounded. The book was de-
scribing the wound rather close-
ly when its message was effec-
tively underscored. One of the
onlookers, apparently unable to
stand the gory detail, fainted.

The odd hour of the rally was
such that it might be held on

“the eleventh hour of the eleven-
th day of the eleventh month.:
This was to emphasize the criti. |
cal import of the rally’s mes-
sage.

Fulbright Committee

Interviews

Eight Men

Eight Davidson students were interviewed for Ful-
bright scholarships by a faculty committee on Nov. 7.

History major Danny Carrell
was interviewed for graduate
study in the United Kingdom;
English major Bill Denham for
graduate study in France; Span-
ish major John McElfresh for
study in either Spain, Colombia,
or Mexico; history major Bob
Murdoch for Ecuador; and math
major J. B. Wilkins for study in
Germany.

Students winning this schol-
arship will receive expenses for
one year’s study abroad, includ-
ing transportation to and from
the country.

English major G. T. Aberna-
thy, classics major Knox Aber-
nethy, and history major Neil
Nichols ‘are applying for teach-
ing assistantships in India. This
field was added to the Ful-
bright program this year.

The faculty committee of
Professors G. L. Abernethy, W.
P. Cumming, J. O. Embry, and
J. A. McGeachy will consider
this interview as well as the
student’s academic record, emo-
tional stability, personality, rec-
ommendations, language quali-
fications, and leadership poten-
tial in determining the merit of
each application.

Calvin Candid Camera
Films Anniversary Flick

BY DAVE PUSEY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

For a momént it appeared as if they were either putting in drink machines in
else repossessing the furniture of those venerable estab-

the literary society halls or
lishments. _

But it turned out that the
large vans were mobile filming
units, and the cryptic PRTVC
emblazoned on their sides stood
not for “Pepsi's Right To Vic-
timize Collegians,” but actually
“Protestant Radio and Tele-
vision Center.”

Why this filming activity? All
part of a three-film TV series
being prepared for the 1963
celebration of the Sesqui-Cen-
tennial (150th Anniversary) of
the Presbyterian Synod of North
Carolina.

Why the filming at David.
son? Naturally because we
are one of the Presbyterian
Church’s star attraction in this
synod and because our begin-
nings and importance to the
North Carolina Presbyterians
were almost simultaneous.

Besides, what better illustra-
tion of Presbyterianism could
be given to the viewing public:
martyrdom (Don’t laugh—when
was your last review?), toler-
ance (Davidsonians even upset
their morning class schedules to
hear a rabbi expound on bones
and bugs in Baghdad.), and “as
sure-as-death-and-vespers” pre-
destination (although there is
some uncertainty as to who'll
be at quarterback for the next
play, in which direction white
ducks will come back pressed
from the laundry, and what hor-
rible fate awaits those who haz-
ard visits to the infirmary).

What was filmed at Davidson?

Various campus scenes, many of
them shot last Sunday, when
sweatshirts were scarce and
shirt-tails were generally tucked
in. There was a short filmed
message from President Martin,
and also some shots of a fresh-
man Humanities section.

The’ $151,000 mobile unit
was from the Protestant Ra-
dio and Television Center in
Atlanta, which is producing
all program material for the
Synod. It is headed by DOr.
Ernest J. Arnold, a former
vice-president of Davidson,
while the actual film work is
directed by the center's vice-
president, Car! Degen, former-
ly director of “Meet the
Press” and many other NBC
network productions.

Despite the ponderous array
of equipment that must be un-
loaded for each location shot,
Degen proudly stated, “We can
cap, cover and get moving in
twelve minutes after the last
scene is shot.” Such speed is
presumably vital, since Degen’s
budget probably doesn’t cover
tickets they might get from
conscientious campus cops for
not having a college registra-
tion sticker.

The three TV documentaries
(historical, educational, and
future) are tentatively planned
for broadcast in March, April
and May of 1963. In addition to
the TV programs, similar radio
programs are now in production.

Perhaps this public airing of
the true Davidson will help to
counteract all those rumors
which we know are going to cir-
culate about “Davidson, that
school for jocks,” after we do a
little shaking up of the basket-
ball world this winter.

Vespers Address

The Rev. James O. Speed, Jr.;!
