students (Joseph Cook, Blair Hark-
ness, Rebecca Hunter, and Anne

faculty members about noise lev-
els in versely affecting

By Tom Price

This past Tuesday night Matt _

Bumstead was elected chairman of
the Davidson College Honor Coun-

cil. Bumstead, a junior religion
from. Nashville, Tennessee, as- ,

sumes the post immediately and
will serve through next Spring.

_ Bumstead, whoserved last year
as the Council’s secretary, was first

elected to the Honor Council in the
Spring of his freshman year and
has sat ona total of seven trials. As
Chairman, Bumstead will sitonall
ing a trial’s proper and orderly
progression. The chairman insures
that the Council’s questioning is
relevant and fair.

Catherine Milligan, a junior

like it was an adequate amount of
time” to conduct this investiga- «
tion. He said, “The charge wasn’t
to do a total and extensive investi-
gation, we hadamore narrow view
of what this was about. If the com-
mittee had spent a lot longer, the
issues would have died down. The
situation mandated swift action on
the part of our committee.” Hasty
said, “With limited time and lim-
ited scope of the report, we did a
pretty thorough job.”

Kuykendall said of this com-

mittee, “They have obviously done
us all a service by being a willing
ear.” He said, “They had the lati-
tude to make“ recommendations.
The assumption was to give us

some ideas.” He added that these -

recommendations were not bind-
ing on people in responsibility.
The committee’s report, en-
titled “Rebuilding Community,”
States in the introduction that the
document does not attempt to re-
view the “positive activities and
contributions which could be as-

cribed to individuals and groups
discussed” in the report. It states
that the document instead “focuses
on...perceptions and problems” and
its purpose is to “call for action on
issues which are a cause for com-
mon concern.”

John Patton said that after
hearing from various students,
faculty, and staff it was hard to be
positive and that the committee
ended up with a "real negative

Committee Recommends
Severe Sanctions For SAE

By Tom Price

The Select Committee on Al- .

leged Intolerance directly ad-
dresses the conduct of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity- in its
report to the President. The Com-
mittee reported on campus atti-
tudes toward the fraternity, listed
allegations against the fraternity,
and then later in the report, recom-
mended sanctions against the
house.

The portion of the section

-weitten about SAE begins, “Most

cases of harassmenton the campus
which were reported to us led back
tothe Sigma AlphaEpsilon house.”
The committee said that many
perceive the house to be “a frater-

nity of wealth, influence, and un-
touchability.” Also, they said, “The
‘brotherhood’ appears to espouse
a code of silence which places
loyalty to the fraternity above the
rules of Davidson College.”

The committee listed 12 alle-
gations against SAE and said that
“in no case has any. individual
accepted fully responsibility for
any of these actions.” They went
on to say, “This committee con-
cludes that their abuses differ sig-
-nifican

gree
campus.”

In the recommendation sec-
tion of the report, the committee
said, “The President should direct

those-of other groups on

both-in kind and in de-

the Dean of Students to suspend .
the fraternity from all Patterson _
Court activities, including rush-
ing, initiation of the Class of 1995
and pledging of the Class of 1996,
and parties (social probation), until
July 1, 1994.” Other recommen-
dations included the appointment
of three SAE alumni “to monitor
the activities of the fraternity dur-
ing the suspension period and sub-
sequently” and a public apology
from the fraternity “for its behav-
ior this year.”

Steven Lilly, the President of
SAE, believes that the commit-
tee’s report “deals unfairly with

Patterson Court Presidents
Comment On Report's Findings

ByCindyEbbs

On March 11, 1992, a Report
to the President of Davidson Col-
lege by the Select Committee on
Alleged Intolerance entitled
“Rebuilding Community” was
published and released to the
Davidson Community. The presi-
dents of-each house on Patterson
Court were contacted and asked to
express their views and percep-
tions on the Report in general, the
Report regarding Patterson Court,
and the specific allegations and
recommendations regarding the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity
described in the Report. Those
who responded are David Wright

of Phi Delta Theta, Sarah Way of

Connor House, Travis Hinson of

the Black Student Coalition, Zama
Neff of Spencer House, Stuart
Hardy of Pi Kappa Alpha, Mandy
Aycock of Warner Hall, Chris
Malanuk of The Kappa Alpha
Order, Susan Wallace of Rusk
House, and Steven Lilly of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon.

David Wright, on behalf of Phi
Delta Theta, “applauds President
Kuykendall’s effort to understand
Patterson Court.” However, he
does not see the recommended
reforms of the self-selection proc-
ess as “appropriate,” nor does he
“see the need for them.” He feels
that if this proposed process were
instituted, national fraternities on
campus would be facing a “slow
death.”

Wright also stated that the
recommendation to suspend SAE
for two years, prohibiting the ini-
tiation of pledge classes, also “is a
prescription for a slow death for
the SAE Fraternity.” Wright be-
lieves that “some [of SAE’s] ac-

‘tions do warrant punishment,” but

the recommendations given by the
committee are “extremely harsh.”
Wright also stated that it would be
more productive to have SAE as “a
working member of the commu-
nity.”

Wright stated that the Report
is “shocking and extremely for-
eign to all of the members of Phi
Delta Theta”. He believes that “‘in-
