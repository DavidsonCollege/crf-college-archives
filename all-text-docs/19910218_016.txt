THE DAVIDSONIAN CAMPUS LIVING MONDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1991

S.G.A Weekend Overemphasizes Getting Drunk?

By Kim Munsterman

Ask Davidson students to de-
scribe their first memories of
Davidson College, and many will
reminisce about their experiences
as prospectives at SGA weekend.

One sophomore remembers the
special dinner for prospectives in
the Commons and “the feeling of
being told we were all accepted to
Davidson;”’ a junior woman recalls
naively asking directions from
Pika’s porch to Richardson!

Although some. students
deemed their memories “not ap-
propriate for print,” all those who
have attended a past SGA week-
end vividly remember their first
impressions of Davidson and their
initial acquaintances, many of
which have become lasting friend-
ships.

Approximately 100 prospec-
tive students will again experience
a Davidson weekend first-hand on
Thursday, March 7, through Satur-
day, March 9. The weckend, ac-
cording to Barbara Bixby, admis-

sions counselor, is “torecruit many
of the most qualified applicants.”

As in past years, prospectives
will be given opportunities to meet
Davidson students, to attend
classes, and to sample the week-
end social life.

Yetthis year, say studentcoor-
dinators, the focus will be some-
what altered as a result of prob-
lems from other SGA weekends.

many prospectives as they at-
tracted.

Senior Kristi Kessler, also an
SGA coordinator, adds, “Our goal
is to give them a really well-
rounded picture of life at Davidson.
I realize that Patterson Court is
definitely-a part of it, but-it’s not-
the only part.”

This SGA weekend, which will
emphasize a broader view of cam

will give students an alternative to
the 10 PM - 2 AM drinking that
typically occurs.

“We are not trying to mis-
guide or misinform them,” Davis
explains. “We're trying to show
all sides of Davidson.”

Reflecting -upon-their SGA
experiences, some students would
agree that the emphasis on drink-
ing was a bit overwhelming.

Sophomores Jennifer McClean and Laura Long were both disappointed
in what McClean described as a weekend during which "many people

seemed to be solely focused on getting trashed."

Sophomore Carla Davis, SGA
weekend coordinator, explains that
often SGA weekends are domi-
nated by drinking and Patterson
Court parties."

Lastyear students spentall their
time waiting for beer to come up
from the basement, and never got
tosee the real Davidson,” she states.

Many of the incidents on the
court may have scared away as

pus activities, will featurean Inter-
national Night, a comedy club, a
cook-out with three houses partici-
pating, and a campus-wide con-
cert.

Says Davis, “We wantto show
the whole Davidson community
working together -- freshmen, up-

perclassmen, fraternities, and in- .

dependents.”

lights?

Is there a sticker on the
mirror telling you to turn off the
water to conserve water? Well,
there should be! With the help
of the R.L.O., members of the
Davidson Environmental. Ac-
tion Committee were able to get
these stickers put up in bath-
rooms all over campus in an
effort to take action to conserve
water and energy and to save
our earth. This is just one of
many changes you may be see-
ing around campus these days.

Another change is in the
seniorapartment toilets. Plastic
bottles filled with sand were
placed in the toilets in order to
displace water, reducing the
amount of water used in each
flush.

Bottles could only be put in
the senior apartment. toilets
because of the nature of the
plumbing system in the apart-
ments, which differs from the

of Davidson or not, but it’s an

Sophomores Jennifer McLean
and Laura Long were both disap-
pointed in what McLean described
asa weekend during which “many
people seemed to be solely fo-
cused on getting trashed.”

But, McLean continues, “The
people were so friendly that it re-
ally made me want to come here.”

On the other hand, freshman
John Franklin recalls having “a

great time at the social functions
and at the weekend as a whole.”

He claims that his experience
greatly influenced his decision to
attend Davidson, as he had initially
been leaning toward another school.

. Similarly, freshman Bailey
Foster says, “My parents made me
apply to Davidson, but after SGA
weekend I was pretty sure I wanted
to come here.”

The future of SGA weekend
will be determined by the success
of this year’s changes.in the week-
end’s overall focus.

If problems from the past reoc-
cur, the tradition of SGA weekend
could be greatly altered.

Davis and Kessler seem opti-
mistic about their plans and have
talked with each freshman hall to

ensure cooperation.

States Bixby, "Admissions will’
always have a need for some kind
of recruitment weekend, but there’s
no guarantee that the format of the
weekend won’t change in the fu-

ture.”
