Ken May

It’s good to be back

You should have seen me at the
end of last spring. After a sopho-
more year chock full of pre-med,
labs, late nights, and gallons of
Mello Yello, I was a goner. I was
overworked, overstressed, my
brain was friedover-easy, and most
importantly, I was overjoyed to
leave Davidson. So thorough was
my discontentment, that I was all
ready to transfer to another school.

Not knowing’ whether
Davidson or myself was to blame
didn’t really matter. Everything
was wrong and something had to
change ... bigtime! Thus, I de-
cided to study abroad, perhaps as

much to “bail out” of Davidson as
for the experience itself.

Before I left, I had a long chat
with my advisor, Dr. Williamson,
about my health, happiness, and
future at Davidson. ~

He said something to me of
profound insight, whichat the time
I completely discounted.

“Ken, you may not feel good
about this place now, but I'll bet
some time away will make you
really grow to appreciate what
Davidson is all about.” Sure, and
the moon is made of green cheese
too.

But I'll be darned, here it is a

Name:. Sara Lyn Goodman
Year: Senior

Major: French

Hometown: Oklahoma City, OK

Abroad experience: Junior year in France.

Ken May thinks that going abroad leads to a greater appreciation
of Davidson. After a year in France did you find you appreciate
Davidson more?
I don’t know if I appreciate it any more but it was good to go. |

Now that President Kuykendall has announced his resignation,
what do you think Davidson should look for in a new president?
An open-minded person willing to lead us into a new century.

In your opinion, should he or she be Presbyterian?
I could care less as long as they do a good job.

Tell me, what’s wrong with The Davidsonian?
I don’t know. I never read it — except for the Opinions page. That's
the only page I read.

Have you made any big plans for Valentine’s Day?
Ihave a date with my boyfriend.

How do you feel about graduation? Are you scared or excited?
I’m excited. I’m just ready to get out of here. I’m sort of in a
nonacademic frame of mind which isn’t good when you have to write
a thesis.

Any additional comments?
Keith Davis, stay away from my window!

The Bavidsoniameeds a cartoonist.
Until some creative soul volunteers to
rovide us with weekly, witty humor, we
shall be forced to print hideous attempts
at artistic editorialism such as:

those crazy frat pledges
make fools of them-
Ives in the library?

College is so
cool!

Help us. .

year later, and I’m back. And Big
Doc Williamson was right. This

school really has taken on a new

light upon returning.

Don’t get me wrong. Leaving
Davidson for a while was 'the best
thing I ever did. Like everybody
else who goes abroad, I met, saw,
and experienced so many new
people, places, and ideas that I’m
forever changed.

Going to the University of
Edinburgh gave me the opportu-
nity to do many things I never
could have imagined doing here:
to be anameless face in a crowd, to
attend lectures of several hundred

students, to get lost on the way to
class, to cook for myself or starve,
to do my own laundry, to be alone.
That was allso cool and frequently
I find my thoughts drifting back to
freedom of it all.

It’s interesting though. The
more I experienced the differences
of my new school, the more I be-
gan to appreciate the experience
that Davidson offers.

As my semester in Scotland
came toaclose, my eager anticipa-

-tion for returning to my old school

grew.
All those things I had to get
away from, I couldn’t wait to get

back to. Friendly familiar faces on
the way to class, new intellectual
challenges, old friends, and that
warm homey feeling of our quaint
campus. You all know what I
mean.

It’s funny the way things work
out, and in ways you’d never ex-
pect.

Davidson is a special college,
and often a hard one to deal with. I
guess you just need to step away
every once ina while to reacquaint
yourself with what it’s all about
and why you're here. I’m glad I
had the chance to get away, but
boy it’s good to be back!!

Starving

Sweethearts

I spent $37.95 on cards at the Hall-
mark store Friday. No denying,
I’m a card freak. I can’t leave a
card store empty-handed. But only
at Valentine’s do my expenditures
on cards exceed my grocery bill.
Now you probably think I like
Valentine’s Day. Why else would
I drain pocketbook and pantry to
celebrate the occasion? The truth

I want a Valentine. But this year
will be yet another verse in the

more Valentine’s Days, I figure
I'll look like a gigantic bon bon
myself. But who cares? It’s not
like I have a Valentine to impress.

spent so much money on Valen-

Russell Stover anymore. Guess

shoveas many of those babies down
