Students explore majors, summer opportunities, future possibilities

By Scott Windham

Students who are unsure of
career plans and are trying to de-
cide between many different-ca-
reer paths can receive advice and
assistance at the Office of Career
Services. In addition, underclass-
men considering options for a ma-
jor, summer job, or internship are
highly encouraged to use Career
Services’ facilities, according to
director Carol Jordan.

Jordan typically schedules
over 700 career counseling ses-
sions per year with Davidson stu-
dents and recent graduates. After
completing a resume with the help
of Career Services staff members,
students sign up for a session with
Jordan to polish and strengthen
resumes, discuss options for sum-

merand semester employment, and
consider career plans. A session
typically lasts between thirty min-
utes and one hour.

It is not necessary for a stu-
dent to have a concrete idea of
what he or she wants to do for a
summer, year-long, or long-term
job, but it is advisable for them to
have a general awareness of their
strengths, interests, and goals. Jor-
dan emphasizes that success often
depends largely on the student’s
willingness to follow up on infor-
mation and ideas gained through
counselling sessions.

Exploring options, she says,

is the key to success, especially for
students who have only a vague
idea of career interests. For this
type of exploration, Jordan highly
recommends mentorships, intern-
ships, and informational inter-
views. Students can take advan-
tage of these opportunities by vis-
iting the Office of Career Services,
the Office for Experiential Pro-
grams, the Dean Rusk program,
and other departments on campus.

Jordan also employs several
testing devices to assist students in
making career-related decisions.
She often uses the Strong-
Campbell career interest inventory

Senior class meeting broadens horizons

By Sally Stone

Seniors took one step closer to
graduation Thursday night, Janu-
ary 27 when the Career Services
Office held the spring Senior Class
Meeting to offer guidance and sup-
port to the class.

Over fifty students attended
the brief meeting in the Multi- Pur-
pose Room. They first heard from
Kristin Atkins and Rod Carter,
chairpersons of the Senior Class
Gift Committee, who announced

an upcoming forum to decide on
the senior class gift and to generate
broad support of its commission.

Careers Office director Carol
Jordan began the meeting with
words of support and encourage-
ment as she stated, “If you haven’t
found what you want to do yet...
that’s great” because the careers
office has the means and ability to
assist students.

She reminded seniors to uti-
lize on-campus activities like in-

$1,200 for only five meals a week.
To supplement this number of
meals, many members are forced
to eat in the Commons.

For the most part, flexibility
characterizes the women’s houses.
Junior Liz Flemming believes that
Connor House is “very willing to
accommodate problems.” Sopho-
more Katherine Hash says “Rusk
has long lists of flexible options
for seniors, and underclassmen pay
full board unless they have a class
or work conflict.”

The women’s houses all offer
breakfast and have food out and

available for random snacking.
Unfortunately for the men, they do
not enjoy as many eating privi-
leges within their fraternities.

All of the houses on Patterson
Court encourage their members to
eat full board, which enables the
house to have better meals.

Senior Josh Larned does not
eat at his fraternity anymore, be-
cause the “food isn’t very good
and I still have to pay $430 for
beer.”

If you are still questioning the
quality and quantity of food, the
flexibility in meals, and the cost of
your board, then perhaps you
should rethink Vail.

dressed the engineering and emo-
tional expressiveness of the Pieta
by revealing the results of his ex-
tensive research in discovering se-
crets and disturbances found in the
sculpture. For instance, Steinberg
spoke of the Virgin’s body struc-
ture and youth, the technical as-
pects of Christ’s body and position
on Mary’s lap, and the symbolic
Eucharistic meaning of the sculp-
ture as a whole.

Born in Moscow, Steinberg is
the retired holder of the Benjamin
Franklin Chair in art history at the
University of Pennsylvania. His
areas of expertise in art include
Michelangelo, Picasso, the archi-
tecture of Borromini, and the na-
ture of post-modernism.

controversial The Sexuality of

Steinberg’s credentials reflect
his intelligence and talent as an art
historian. A member ofthe Ameri-
can Academy of Arts and Sciences
and of the University College in
London, he was also the first art
historian to receive an Award in
Literature from the American
Academy and Institute of Arts and
Letters. In addition, he received
the top writing award bestowed by
the College Art Association: The
Frank Jewett Mather Award.

noted that the careers office could
help seniors if they design their
own search.

Scott Windham and Margaret
Goode reinforced Jordan’s advise.
Both emphasized the on-campus
events, distinguishing t etween the
different types of interviews and
information sessions.

Windham alsoadvised seniors
who were planning for the coming
years to think one to four years
ahead, not forty years. He further
stated, “Do what you love and the
money will follow.” —

in conjunction with the Myers-
Briggs personality profile to mesh
a student’s current job interests
and personality traits.

In addition, the highly infor-
mative SigiPlus computer program
is an excellent indicator of per-
sonal values, which are another
highly important criteria for choos-
ing acareer. Jordan points out that
while these three inventories are
useful for making discoveries
about oneself, a career counseling
session is equally important for
interpreting and combining results,
verbalizing plans and ideas, and
considering options.

Senior Cynthia Brooks, an Art
History major from Devon, Penn-
sylvania, recently took the Myers-
Briggs inventory. Although each
incoming freshman takes the
Myers-Briggs, scores often change

over a student’s career at Davidson.

Brooks comments that the test
gave an accurate profile and was,
for her, an affirming process. The
inventory indicated, forexample, a
strong correlation between Brooks’
preference for art and her person-
ality traits. Myers-Briggs does not
necessarily eliminate certain op-
tions, but indicates which career
fields might be undesirable or less
productive for a student.

For example, a student with a
high score for introversion might
struggle in a job which demands
constant contact with groups of
people.

Brooks adds that the inven-
tory gave her new ideas of fields
she might be interested in pursu-
ing, and gave her a different per-
spective on her own interests and
personality traits.

best fulfill this purpose. A new
Union in this location would be
close to most residence halls,
Patterson Court, the Commons,
athletic fields, Chambers, and the
library and would attract the “pe-
destrian traffic” en route to those
destinations.

The new Union would take
over the various activities and of-
fices currently housed in Grey. The
committee recommends thatitalso
house an ATM machine, a copy
machine, 24-hour computers, laun-
dry distribution point and/or
laundromat.

Input from campus groups has
indicated that “food is critical to
the success” of the new Union so
the committee recommends that
the new Union operate a pub/cafe
serving a variety of favorite foods
at almost all hours.

Large open areas for “gather-
ing” and well-lighted study areas
both with sofas and chairs are also
important parts of the committees
conception of the new Union.

The committee did not agree
with MPC’s recommendation that
the current union building Grey
become an “Union Auxiliary.”
MPC suggested that Grey could
serve as a place for students and
faculty to “hang out” during the
day, but the committee is opposed
to MPC’s pointed separation of

According to McMillen, the
Union Planning Committee wants
to “encourage all interaction in a
central location at any time of day
or night” in order to “strengthen
the college’s sense of community.”

MPCsuggested that the book-
store stay in Grey in what would be
the Auxiliary Union, but the com-
mittee strongly opposes this idea.

The bookstore is for many pro-
spective students and their parents

an important part of the college’s
image and ought to, according to
the committee, make a statement
about the school’s identity.

The committee would like to
see the bookstore in its own space
in the new Union where it could
become an integral part of the cam-
pus, generate more revenues, and
possibly become the setting for
poetry readings, book signings, and
live music.
