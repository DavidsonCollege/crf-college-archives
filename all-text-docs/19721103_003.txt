‘School For Scandal’ Begins
Four Day Showing In Hodson

By JOHN CASSELS
Asst. Features Editor

-If you have lately noticed
students bending deep at
the waist, women making deep
curtsies, powdered wigs, knee
britches and long velvet coats,
don’t think that you are the
victim of time-warp.

Rather you have caught a
glimpse of the characters of the
Drama _ Department's first
major production of the year,
“The School for Scandal.”

Richard Sheridan's 18th
century comedy of manners is
being presented in Davidson's
Hodson Hall tonight and

tomorrow at 8:15 p.m.

in 1777,’ said director. Rupert T.
Barber Jr. ‘‘It's currently

having a successful run in New
York."

The play actually has two
plots: ‘‘one of the group of
slanderous gossips and the
other of the young woman who
married an old man, coming
together in the exquisitely
written ‘Screen Scene’ a
masterpiece of English
literature,"’ said Barber. ‘‘The
play has wit and charm and is
extremely funny. Many of the
traits Sheridan was lambasting
are, unfortunately, with us
today--making the play bite a
bit still,’ he said.

cast and crew have had to adopt
the styles of polite society of the
18th Century.

Mrs. Rupert T. Barber Jr.
has designed and sewn the
costumes for the production
with assistance from Susan
Englander, an exchange
student from Mary Baldwin.
Mrs. Barber also remade cos-
tumes from *‘She Stoops to Con-
quer” that ran about six years
ago which will also be used.

Several other girls have been
involved in preparing the
costumes, according to Barber,
since ‘‘buttons, bows, and lace
have to go on after the costume
is actually made.

“This takes hours with every
man's vest having 10-14 buttons
and every coat having at least
10 buttons and four yards of
lace,’ Barber said.

Powdered wigs are worn by
the actors and make-up is being
handled by Drama 21 students
as a lab under the direction of
Barber.

Since the play takes place in
18th Century England, the
department has tried to suggest
a British accent without going
beyond the audience's
understanding.

Beyond’ the _ technical
production of 18th Century
comedy, Barber said, ‘‘The
production is staged in a style
reminiscent of the 18th Century.

‘‘Hodson Hall has been
converted into an elegant
theatre with a stage and a deep
acting area in front of the
curtain with proscenium doors
built in to facilitate the flow of
the multi-scened comedy,” he
added.

The entire production is
presented in the soft mellow
glow of simulated candlelight,
a chandelier and footlights.

Reiss Lectures Here On Justice

By HARRIETT HODGES
Staff Writer

Piedmont lecturer Albert J.
Reiss Jr. focused on the
fragmentation and
deterioration of American
justice in his talk here Tuesday.

Reiss said that the trouble
with American justice is that
‘*We no longer have any kind of
consensus about what standard
should be applied.

‘Historically we have been
able to justify justice by saying
that) someone should be
punished for a particular act,”
he said. This is no longer
possible, however, Reiss said.
He pointed to the conflicting
opinions about capital
punishment as an example of
the lack of a standard of justice.

Although the popular notion
of justice is that it treats
everyone fairly, this is far from
the truth in the United States,
Reiss said.

“The system discriminates
on a class and status basis. The
rich are less likely to get
arrested and less likely to get

charged," he said. ‘‘In the
American style of justice we do
rip off the poor.”

Reiss pointed to a

deterioration of our basic
principles of justicé as a reason
for the state of American
justice today. *‘We have eroded
that principle in just about
every way possible,” he said.
The use of bail as a means of
detention which discriminates

against the poor exemplifies
this fact, Reiss said.

Other evidence of this erosion
of American principles of
justice can be seen in the
bargaining which takes place in
our courts, Reiss said.

“The prosecutor and the
defense make a deal and decide
what to do with the defendent
without consulting the
defendent,”' he said.

We have started a system in
which we assume that clients
are guilty and make deals to get
them off. It is not uncommon for
us to institutionalize deceit in
this country,"* Reiss said.

Another trend of the
American system of justice has
been the lessening of the
citizen's role in the process,
Reiss said.

‘There used to be a system in
which ordinary citizens had
active roles as jurors. But, the
jury system will become
obsolete if the rate continues to
fall,’ he said.

As a result of this movement
away from participation of
citizens in the judicial process,
*‘We become increasingly less
aware of what goes on-in the
system,” he said.

Reiss suggested several ways
to help remedy the state of
justice in the United States
today. The overload in the
courts could be decreased by
“decriminalizing victimless
crimes such as_ drunken
driving.’ Reiss said.

He emphasized that a
centrally coordinated system of

justice is needed if we are to
improve the American style of
justice.

Reiss is a_ professor of
sociology at Yale University.
He has written several books on
criminal justice in the United
States.

Used Book Store
Begins Next Term

By LARRY MIMMS
Staff Writer

A Davidson College Used
Book Store will probably begin
operations during the winter
term according to SGA Senator
Jim Goodloe, developer of the
used book store plan.

This statement came after
the SGA had approved a 5 year
loan of $500 to the APO service
fraternity, as organizational
capital for the establishment of
a beginning book inventory.

The APO under its president,
Chris Allison, agreed to
organize and operate the
proposed Used Book Store, in
lieu of its previous service
project, the seasonal second
hand book sale.

This planned second hand
book store would provide a
permanent’ place where
students can sell their used
textbooks, and would make

returns of North Carolina and
its immediate surrounding
states, Connette said. Detailed
coverage will also be provided
for the North, also.

There will be from three to
five televisions in the Union for
viewing from 7 p.m. until
everyone leaves. Several kegs
of beer along with coffee and
doughnuts, will be served.

It is tentatively planned for a
musical group to play in the bar
from 8 p.m. until midnight.

lower prices. This bookstore
would have the advantage of
sale and purchase of texts
throughout the year.

‘We hope to begin collection
of second hand _ books
immediately in preparation for
the winter term,"' Goodloe
said.This store will buy and
offer for sale only those
reference books and textbooks
which professors have said will
be used in the upcoming
quarters.

‘Perhaps other books will be
sold at a later date,’’ Goodloe
added.

A questionaire distributed
among faculty concerning their
ability to list the books from
which they will be teaching one
quarter in advance was
answered positively, especially
in the areas of Social Science,
Math, and Foreiegn Language.

“It is necessary that the
professors give us a list of books
that they will use so that we can
obtain the second-hand books
which will be in demand for that
quarter,’ Goodloe explained.
‘‘Buying policies will be
determined from those lists."’

The use of a room in Belk
basement underneath the
present student store has been
secured to house the used book
store.

No objections to the new store
were voiced by Peter Nichols,
manager of the student store. In
fact he expressed the hope that
the new store might help him
cut down on reorders of books
and help save on shipping
expenses.
