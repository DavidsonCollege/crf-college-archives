Dear Mom and Dad,
You'll never believe what a great place it is here
at Camp Davidson. All the guys on my hall are real

activities. We went swimming in Lake Mormon yes-
terday and had a mixer with the girl campers last night
(Me and Joey snuck outside to shoot off fireworks).

We have arts and crafts classes every day. We
also have sports and science. We made some ice
cream and sang songs in Chemistry class yesterday!
Boy that was fun! (Joey wanted to throw it at the
girls.) My counselors also showed a new kind of
fingerpainting. They called it ‘abstrakt’.

They’ve got a new golf course here, too! Me and
Joey are practicing so we can beat Dad when we get
back to the Club. Maybe Dad can come down here
and play on Parents’ Weekend. Make sure to tell him
not to drive on the grass. Mr. Silver gets real mad
when people do that. Mr. Barrel says that pretty soon
we'll get a new gym and that it might even have in-
door tennis courts. The whole family could play ten-

Welcome To The Camp

They have a real nice rifle range, too. | wanted to

years and wear a uniform. There’s no dress code at
Camp Davidson, but it seems that almost everyone
wears a shirt with the name of another camp on it.

The mess hall is real nice, too. There’s enough
room to fly a kite in there. The food’s not too good,
but they make great jello (Joey says its good for
throwing at girls).

Almost forgot! They do my laundry too. And now
they even paint our rooms. No more messy do-it-
yourself painting. Our counselors are just like big
brothers. And Uncle Will, he’s my Biiiigggg brother.
And of course, there’s Aunt Sue.

They're taking real good care of me at Camp
Davidson.

Love,

Dennis
P.S. Send plenty of brownies!
