Open Forum debates Davidson divestment controversy

By JIM DILLON
A recommendation on David-
son-s policy regarding investment
in companies who do business in
South Africa was scheduled to be
presented to the Board of Trustees

this morning by the finance com- .

mittee who held an open forum for
students, faculty and staff of the
college to voice their opinions re-
garding the policy yesterday in the
900 Room. ~
Ralph Holt, chairman of the

committee, stated that the forum.
would have an impact on the com-
mittee’s recommendation al-
though he declined to comment on
what that recommendation would
be. ;

“Our policy is of an open
forum,” Holt said. “We certainly
hope to come up with a solution to
what is certainly not a simple
problem.”

Holt noted that although the
committee would definitely make

that recommendation may be that
further study on the issue is neces-
sary and that the board has a
number of alternatives to consid-
er.

The committee heard ‘state-
ments from 20 people. Thirteen of
the speakers advocated divest-

panies doing business with South
Africa while seven suggested that

the apartheid problem. All 20 in-
dicated that they thought apar-
theid was wrong. Twelve of the
speakers were students, and eight
were faculty and staff members.
Five of the speakers were black.
Each speaker was allowed three
minutes .to present his view
though some went over the iimit.

French professor Alan Singer-
man spoke first, quoting statistics
on the South African situation. He
noted that “a strong majority” of
the Davidson faculty had advo-
cated divestment of college in-
vestments and added that “there is
no other significant action we can
take.”

College chaplain Charlie
Summers cited the Bible as evi-
dence for divestment, adding that
the Presbyterian Church has
called for selected phase divest-
ment and has indicated that the de-
nomination is “moving in a way
toward total divestment.” Sum-
mers said that by divesting David-
son would express its “‘church-re-
latedness.’

Administration silences Chamber's buzzers

By NELLE McCORKLE

Vice President for Academic
Affairs and Dean of the Faculty
Robert Williams decided to elimi-
nate the Chambers buzzer that sig-
nals the change of classes for a
one-month trial period following
an Executive Committee of the
Faculty recommendation.

The buzzer, which currently
sounds at 10 minutes before and
on the hour, is expected to be

Williams said his decision to
test silencing the buzzer emerged
from faculty suggestions. “It was.
brought to my attention by a
number of faculty members, par-
ticularly new faculty, that the
bells were . . . annoying, obtru-
sive, and possibly unnecessary
and that they smacked of high
school,” he said.

Williams called the use of

immediately, Williams said. The
Chambers bell, located on the
building’s roof, will continue to
chime at the same intervals as the
buzzer; Davidson College Pre-

sbyterian Church bells ring on the

quarter hour.

that “active divestment is a once
only statement” whereas retaining
investments with such companies
allows stockholders to have some
influence on the nation.

Senior Lynn Michie spoke of
her summer spent in Namibia (for-
merly Southwest Africa) which is
currently occupied by South Af-
rica. She related the story of a
mother whose two sons were
forced into hiding. “The time is
now. to do something.” she said.
“It’s past time, and so I urge di-
vestment.””

Sophomore John Engel
equated divestment to “Pilot's
washing his hands of the crucifix-
ion.” Engel argued for the
economic growth of the college
and said that no compromises
should be made to a recent surge
of activism on campus. He said
that such activism was the result
of “McCarthyism of the 80’s”
which insinuates that all who do
not support divestment are racists.

Senior Bill Bugg began by.

stated divestiture would actually
