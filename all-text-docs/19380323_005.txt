Captain Howard McFadyen and es-

New Type Purchased

Beginning with the first issue-
entirely new and. different héadline
type, bought by the paper in co-
Operation with the Standard Print-
ing. Company, topped the Davidson-
ian stories. In order to take some
of the burden from the shoulders
of those in charge Fitzhugh Dade,
a member of the senior class, was
appointed assistant editor. Dade
has been in charge of copy-reading
throughout the year.

On October 11, a poll conducted
by The Davidsonian revealed that
ae majority of the students favored
Roosevelt and his policies, but were
against his serving a third term.

Just about this time a feud broke
out between The Davidsonian and
The Scripts ‘no Pranks over the
tnagazine’s chief boast (which later
proved futile) that it could name;
the artist who decorated the town
water tank.

Question of the Week

The Question of the Week. a
column which has proved popu-
Jar with the student body, made its
first appearance in’ the issue of
October 20. Metropolitan newspap-
ers had issued a feature of this type
previously, but as far as the editors
know, The Davidsonian was the
first college newspaper to publish
the column.

October 27 saw the Phi Beta
Kappa-Omicron Delta Kappa issue,
.first eight-page edition of the year.
Pictures of the students bid to
both societies were published: and
a large replica of the ODK key
was printed im blue ink on the front
“page.

Homecoming Issue

of Scripts ‘n Pranks, The Davidson-
dan presented its homecoming issue,
featuring tales of the gala affairs

On November 17, Dean M. EF.
Sentelle wrote a letter, published ine
The Davidsonian, exhorting the
students to give their support to
the new measure advocating prohi-
bition of all drinking at Davidson
dances.

The November 24 issue carried
pictures of Teeny Lafferty and
Bailey Williams on the front page
as a preceding feature of the an-
nual Turkey Day classic to be play-
ed the next day between the Wild-
cats and Wake Forest.

Subsidization Issue

The meeting of the Southern
Conference about two weeks after
the Thanksgiving issue, which, was
principally occupied with discussion
on subsidizaton of athletes, caused
quite a bit of comment from the
student body in the form of letters
to the editor and editorials.

Editor Vowles took up hali the
Christmas holidays counting the
votds in the “You Be the Editor”
poll which appeared.in the next. is-
sue, and which reveated"that “King

the new infirmary, the Davidsonian

United States.
