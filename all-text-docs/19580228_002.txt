Does The Honor System
Need Some Mechanical Changes?

Through the years. Davidson's
honor system has proven itself by the
clear fact that it has worked. Because
it has worked we have been able to
present a solid front to all critics.

In some other colleges and univer-
sities the honor svstem is a mere tool
that the administration uses for propa-
ganda. At Davidson, fortunately, the
honor system is a reality. It is put to
practice and it works. It is a student
institution, run by students. respected
bv students.

Basically. our honor system is:

I will not lie.

I will not cheat.

I wilt not steal.

1 will report the one who does so.

Honor never changes. Honor today
is the same honor as in 1837 when
Davidson opened. While it is true that
honor today is the same as a hundred
years ago, we here at Davidson tend
to take our system for granted—main-
ly because it works so well.

THE DAVIDSONIAN feels. there-
fore, that in the light of recent ‘trends
that something be done to revitalize
the honor system. We. therefore. pro-
pose the adoption of the following
four-point plan:

l. Creation of an Honor Council
separate from the present. student
council. This would involve a separa-

tion of powers now vested in the stu-
dent council. This new Honor Coun-
cil should be composed of nine stu-
‘dents, appointed by the student coun-
cil with the advice of a faculty-student
committee. (See editorial in DAVID-
SONIAN on February 7.)

2. Little interference from the
faculty and administration in the de-
cisions of the Honor Council. If the
honor system is going to be a student
affair. then let the students make the
final judgment upon the accused. On
the other hand. since the faculty must
reserve the right to reverse decisions,
then let them do it in the light of tre-
mendously important new evidence.

3. More conscious emphasis
should be placed upon the system.
This could be done in three ways: by
the individual professors in: the class-
room:. by the president of the Honor
Council before the entire student body

at the beginning of each school year '

and by citing case histories to make
the point: and by a thorough indoc-
trination fo new students.

+ The strengthening. of secrecy
surrounding trials and witnesses. At
present it is not difficult to pick up in
the halls or bull sessions many details
concerning a trial. Often these rumors
are false and serve to do harm. Stricter
secrecy is absolutely necessary to gain
the active cooperation of the students.

We're Missing
Something Big

Osmond Barringer returned to the
campus last week to make a talk to
Sigma Pi Sigma physics fraternity.
The fascinating vigorous man of 81
years is credited with: making the
first experiment with X-rays in the
United States in 1896 while a student
at Davidson. ,

The witty old man was full of
stories and facts about the college's
history, and he made it very clear the
formal, frozen-faced pictures appear in
dusty annuals are no indication of the

tions we cannot afford to make —

enemies of near-by residents.

And yet, in spite of all this, anyone
listening to Mr. Barringer would have
difficulty in concluding that this
“modern generation’’ was very mali-
cious or even very full of mischief as
compared to some times in the past.
As a member of fact, he would cause
one to think, somewhat nostalgicly,
that these youngsters might be miss-
ing out on something.

Discussion
Groups

By ED ARMFIELD

A recent survey of Davidson
students with regard to the
present Honor System revealed
many different opinions and
evaluations of the system.

This group, judged to be an
accurate cross section of cam-
pus life and opinion, agreed to
the man with the principle of
the Honor System, but beyond
that it would be difficult to
make other generalizations.

Pete Kellogg, rolling over in
bed, seemed to sum yp the cam-
pus feeling by saying, “It is the
best way to run the Student
Government ideally—if it is en-
forced.” Pete went on to sug-
gest that “what the Honor Sys-
tem really means should be put
over to the Student Body more
clearly.”

As did some of the others in-
terviewed, he felt that the ma-
jority of the students do not
have a clear idea of the Honor
System now.

Bob Shoffner was also em.
phatic-in stressing the need for
student enlightenment on this
often misunderstood issue.
“While the Honor System is
now strong enough, I believe
that a clearer understanding by
the, Student Body is needed.
More interest in Student Gov-
ernment would help to bring
about this greater understand-
ing.”

There was a great deal of di-
ference in the opinions of those

the present system. “The penal

ties for violations of the Honor.

System are not too harsh be-
cause the individual knows what
is expected and what the con-
sequences for violations will
be.” was Chris Bremer’s opinion
of a controversial point.

John Poindexter, supporting
the. modification of penalty
presented his argument that,
“the Honor System should help
the boy, but. in college, where
the only penalty is dismissal,
it hurts the boy immeasurably.
Also, a lesser penalty (extended
campus) would make the student
feel more prone to ‘come
clean’ on all matters.”

Just as sure of his feelings
was freshman Charlie Hunter,
who. said of the Honor Eystem,
“I'm proud of it myself. If
anything were done to lower
the standards it would hurt Da-
vidson College. Because s our
Honor System is one of the
strongest points of the school I
would be opnosed to any change
or modification of its present
form.” A mathematician might
think of Charlie's evaluation as
a rule that says “the standard
of the college is directly propor-
tional to the standard of the
Honor System.”

Marshalf LaFar was just as
enthusiastic in supporting the
present set-up. “I think it is ef-
fective, so long as it is en-

forced,” he said. Marshall then
pointed out that the Honor
System is good as long as no
innocent persons are hurt. His
opinion was that secret trials
strengthen the system while pro-
tecting the individual.

This matter of secret trial was
another point of disagreement
within the Student Body.

Gregory Grana looked up from
his books long enough to

speak out for an official outlet:

of the facts in the trial of a vio-
lation so that idle gossip over a
cup of coffee will not falsely
persecute or ostracize an_ in-
dividual who is in fact in-
nocent.

Bob Shoffner also felt that
the student body was en-
titled to more particulars dur-
ing the actual trials.

“Although rumors will cir-
truth will
eventually get out,’ was George
Hart's rather philosophical
viewpoint of this problem.
George stressed the value of a
working Honor System in the
building of sturdy character.
“Within the Limits of my experi-
ence;” he said, “the Honor Sys-

‘tem has proven itself successful.

Dave Garvin pictured the sys-
tem as “workable—but not
working.” Although he was re-
luctant to suggest a remedy, he
thought that a Student Govern-
ment with a Party System might
tend to put an end to the apathy
which handicaps the situation

now.
Newly elected Phi: Beta Kap-
pa David Bradford recognized
the present system as “worka-
ble” and urged the retention of
secret trial and maximum pro-
tection for indiyiduals, even in
cases of suspensions in which
there is a shadow of a doubt.
There are, this survey showed,
a great number of misconcep-
tions in the Student Body re-
garding our Honor System. One

person characterized it as a re-
versal of our country's judicial
system because, “contrary to
United States tradition, at Da.
vidson a man is guilty until he
proves himself innocent.”

In conclusion, it seems that
the student body. is pretty well.
satisfied with the “status quo.”
The problem is that too few of
us have, a working understand-
ing of just what constitutes this
“status quo.”

By CHARLES HELMS
There aren’t supposed to be any pets in the dormi-
tories, but there have surely been some coons and possums
kept in Duke. This coon in the telephone booth scared
the willy out of several people (yours truly included), and
the word is that Charlie Massey didn’t care for Cop's pos-
sum. Who would at 1:00 A.M.?

Sunday night’s vespers

sermon was characterized by

Gerald Wilson thus: “twenty minutes of Berle, and six
minutes of Barth.” But Barth was never so fond of proof

by analogy.
One of the speaker's

analogies was certainly un-

fortunate (maybe naive), but how could he know how
capable was his audience of flagrant ifreverence and bad
taste during a worship service? And then there are some
rather unoriginal fellows who still think it is funny to

whistle at everything.

There are still some hard feelings toward the P.T.
department; one student complained: it took me three
years to get into shape to pass the test, and then they lost

it; guess Pll have to take it

for three more years,”

A sophomore (who had better remain anonymous) re-
marked recently, “there’s only one thing consistent about
Davidson College, and that’s the book store—it’s never
open.” But it ought to be said that we think this is really

more amusing than just.

The student council, the executive committee, the

judiciary committee, and the entire faculty were not the

only ones who had trials this. week; the Phi Delt pledges
also had one, and Don Lamm and Milton Tankersly were
found guilty. The Sigma Chi and Phi Gam pledges have
also been active in meting out “justice;’ remarkably
enough this includes George Hart and Dave Fagg who were
overpowered and sentenced.

They say it was quite a sight: walking into the head
and finding Heg Anderson asleep in his bed.

Said one senior after going through several place-
ment interviews: ‘Yes, they have been helpful, I’ve de-
cided I want to be employed.”

One more word: beware the Tuesday Knights on Tues-

day evening.

Spirited life that accompanied them. /

He told of one boy who robbed a
grave on a wager with a fellow stu-
dent. He told of a group that greased
the railroad tracks causing the train to
remain in Davidson for a full day. In
that venture they carried a boy with
a broken leg down to do the dirty
work from a stretcher because they
guessed rightly that he would never
be suspected of the crime.

He told of breaking into the Caro-
lina Medical College one night to cut
off the finger of a cadaver to use in
the X-ray experiment. He also revealed
that the famous expirement was for a
long time kept secret lest the experi-
menters get thrown out of school for
using the lab without permission and,
‘worst of all, on a Sunday night.

As Mr. Barringer reeled off anec-
dote after anecdote about past life
and times it was almost impossible
to keep froin making comparisons
with today’s scene, particularly since
the snowball incident is fresh in the
memory.

No one with an objective point of
view can condone such mob action as
there was in the snowballing. Nor
can such flaunting of the authority
of the police and of the college be
approved. Such injury to property
is senseless, and the danger involved
in obstructing a driver’s view can be
great. For the sake of public rela-

Beginning this Sunday night; stu-
dents will have the opportunity to dis-
cuss topics of both campus and na-
tional interest with various profes-
sors. These discussion groups are be-
ing held in the professor's home at
nine o'clock after Vespers, under the
sponsorship of the YMCA.

Here. is a wonderful opportunity
for all interested students to talk in-
formally with men who know their
subject in their related field, of in-
terest.

Too often there is the complaint
that students don’t get a chance to
shoot the bull with professors on seri-
ous and important subjects. Here’s
°a good chance.

An Editorial By
Herbert Hoover

We must not be misled by the
claim that the source of all wisdom
is in the Government. Rather must
we pin our faith upon the inventive-
ness, the resourcefulness, the initia-
tive of every one of us.

The way to greatness is the path
of self-reliance, independence, and
steadfastness in time of trial and
stress.

BEFORE SPRING ELECTIONS

Election Reforms Proposed

By DON CARMICHAEL

Premised on the “happy fam-
ily” view of the student body,
often characterized, by apathy
and determined more by per-
sonal popularity than ‘by a con-
sideration of the candidates’
qualifications and positions, our
elections should be changed in
many ways and can, we feel, be
changed in several ways this
year,

OPEN FORUM

We plan to initiate an open
forum which will allow  presi-
dential candidates to defend and
clarify their platforms and to
present themselves informally to
the student body, while it avoids
such disadvantages as being of
expense to the candidates or do-
ing violence to the “happy fam-
ily” myth by the sordid process
of campaigning.

The two primary factors in-
fluencing elections at Davidson
are objective considerations,
such as the qualifications and
positions of candidates, and the
popularity of the individual can-
didates. In all student publica-
tions elections, but especially
for our purposes, in the Scripts
'n Pranks election, the personal
popularity of the candidates
should be an_ inconsequential

consideration. This office can
and should be determined by a
consideration of qualifications.
We feel that this does not occur.

SET UP BOARD

We suggest that for the pur.
pose of eclecting the editor of
the Scripts 'n Pranks a board
be set up consisting of the
senior staff members of the
magazine and two members of
the English faculty. Rising
seniors would submit themselves
as candidates for the editorship,
setting forth their qualifications
for the job in terms of past
writing experience, stating their
views of the purpose and com-
position of the magazine, and
submitting a sample of their
creative work.

The board would then evaluate
the qualifications of the candi-
dates and select an editor. Such
a board would be distinctly
more qualified to make the selec-
tion than is the student body.
It would have had past experi-
ence with the level interest of
the candidates. It would have a
more accurate opinion of their
talents. It would know the can-
didates on a more equal basis
than does the student body,
composed of seniors, and it
would be more disinterested in

matters of fraternity prestige.
COMBAT APATHY

Finaily, much student apathy,
especially that late in the elec-
tion period, is due to the seem:
ingly endless string of elections.
The Student Government By-
Laws specify ten election cycles,
several involving three or more
candidates. Due to the restric-
tion of nominations of editorial
candidates for the publications.
there is never a duplication of
candidates, and these elections
could well be run off simut-
taneously, thus reducing the
number of election cyctes to
seven, without endangering the
endeavors of the perpetual rin-
ners.

The offices of Vice-President
and Secretary-Treasurer in the
Junior and Sophomore Classes
seem to be honorific and might
well be combined without any
effects. This combination should
strengthen interest in class elec-
tions, an especial point of
apathy.

VITAL FACTOR

It is our hope that these
changes will be seriously con-
sidered, for we. feel they will
promote a larger, better in-
formed, more interested student
body vote, the vital factor in a
meaningful election process.

WELL, [ JUST LEARNED
SOMETHING, CHARUE BROWN.,

By JOHN BERNHARDT

“Now, just what do we want
for this job? Do. we want to elect

somebody who is active, or do

we want somebody with some
ideas?” The voice fights through
the confusing smoke in the
room. And the practical politi-
cians meditate over the aspiring
campus big wheels whose fu-
tures will be decided by the
answer to this question.

“There’s no question about it,”
Joe says finally, exhaling a
dense cloud of smoke. “Every-
body knows him, and thinks he's
a good guy. Nobody else has a
chance.”

“But, don't you see, he’s al-
ready giving up meetings to go
to meetings? If he takes on any
more, he'll never get anything
done on the jobs he already
has.”

KNOWS EVERYBODY

“There’s nobody else in the
fraternity that has the chance
he has. He knows about every-
body in school by name, and
who he’s pinned to, and what
courses he's having trouble
with.” Another cloud of smoke
from Joe.

“He's working hard at that, all
right. I don’t think he ever
worked that hard on any of his
committees.. All fall he takes
life casy and gets a reputation
for being a good guy. Then,
come spring and he seems to be
nothing but concern over the
school. I guess you've got to
hand it to him—he's a smooth
politician.” The voice fades

away into the haze.
ELECTION SEASON

This is Davidson today, ready
for the charge through the haze
down some uncertain road.
Grab your coonskin caps, boys.
and follow the crowd; election
season is about here.

A wise word to the freshman
novitiates might be appropriate
here. They should be made to
understand that now is the time
to bring in all the coneern and
the constructive activeness that
they have not evidenced for half
of their school year, They should
be shaned into yes-men who
agree that we are all out for
our own prestige, and that use-
fulness is only a facade thrown
up around two months of the
year, :

FIRST TASTE

But T can't do this cynical
clarifying, for I have been too
much a part of this to be any-
thing but a realist about activ:
ities here, I drifted, accepting
anything interesting that came
my way.

Today, finishing out my senior
year I am spending more time
on extra-curriculars than I am
on studying or enjoying tife.
From this I am gaining very.
little for the time spent, and to
this 1 contribute nothing more
than my inert form as a plug in

the massive machine which is
Davidson.

SERIOUS FRESHMEN

Two suggestions I will make
here to the serious freshmen.
Plan your work so you can get
well into something, to concen-
trate on it and do it justice.
Don't spread yourself too thin.
So you can’t do anything con
structive. In other words, don't
make the mistakes I have.

The elections board has some
excellent plans for cutting out
superfluous positions on the
campus. If fraternity politics and
Machiavellian subterfuge can be
eliminated, if the clear voice<
do not fade out completely, the

« haze about our elections may be
removed.
