they are justas much a part of the
student-bedy as is each one of_us,
as it is for us to recognize and ap-
preciate the need and benefit of their
maturity. They enter just as whole-
heartedly into, and get just as much
a kick out of participation in any
and all of the school’s activities as
any of the rest of us.

We tip our hat to our “Card-
board Villagers.”

In the same air of expectancy
with which the Renliners watch as
the “air-lift” planes fly in over. theia
city; so the inhabitants of the vil-
lage watch as that well known bird,
the Stork, circles and comes in on
its down-wind leg.

Having kept a record breaking
schedule up to this point, there
are promises of many more flights
to be made in the future. The first

, landing is scheduled to be made ear-
ly in November at apartment 103,
