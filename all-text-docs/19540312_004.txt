SPARKS HEADS YMCA
BOYS WORK PROGRAM

By DICK MOREHEAD

The Boys’ Work Committee of
the Y is capably run by Homer
Sparks, Davidson’s own Gil Dodds.
“Sparkie’s” background, present
and future, are full of activities,

‘interests, and

unusual | ex-

A periences with
boys’ and Y
work. For
three years, he
has worked in
a summer Y-
*» MCA camp in
Anniston, Ala-

Sparkes bama, the me-
tropolis where he spent the 21 best
years of his life. He has been as-
sociated with the school Y for three
years, his last two as chairman of
boys’ work. His main interests also
lie in this field as, after doing a
bounded duty to his country, he
plans to enter graduate school in
final preparation for a career of Y
work, especially in the realm of
boys’ activities.

A man of varied abilities, Homer
has used his talents in several fields
of campus life since first coming
to Davidson. He is co-captain of
the track team and served as cap-
tain and “pacer” for the cross
country team, illuminating David-
son’s athletic record with a second
place in the Southern Conference
in cross country. He was com-
mencement marshal representing
Phi Lit. Society last year, and is
this year a member of the Y Cabi-
net, Scabbard and Blade, D Club,
ODK, the anti-McCarthy movement,
and vice-president of the Kappa
Alpha social fraternity.

Boys’ Work Committee

The boys’ work program is not
one with which the student body
is entirely familiar. Some have
seen, on occasion, the basketball
games played between the halves
of varsity games. Some others
know that football and basketball
games among the boys of the
community are played in season.
The boys’ work program this year,
however, has endeavored to go be-
yond this one sphere of activity.
The main emphasis has been
placed on boys’ groups as clubs
instead of athletic teams alone.

Following this plan, a group of
boys are set up as a club and
during the process of the school
year, carry out a program which
includes mental and physical as
well as spiritual growth. The pro-
gram is set up along national Y
lines adopted by Gra-Y and Jr. Hi
Y orgsnizations. The local boys’
work covers age groups from nine
to sixteen years of age, ranging
over the area from Huntersville
to Mooresville ahd encompassing
boys of varied background, in-
terests, and achievements.

There are five groups under the
Y committee, three in the white
school, two in the colored school,
each headed by members of the
student body on the committee.
The student leaders are all of
varied vocational interests, rang-
ing from industrial psychology
majors to pre-meds who mostly
predominate. Of the original
sixty who signed up for this work,
twenty-four have actively par-
ticipated. Their leaders meet often
with Chairman Sparks to discuss
and criticize committee work,
building an experienced nucleus
for next year’s boys’ work activ-
ities.

The youngest age group at the
white school is under direction
of freshmen Bunny Perkinson and
Baxter Cochran. They have had a
football and a basketball team so
far, and are planning for a soft-

ball team in the spring. During
the basketball season, this team
played Concord and Kannapolis Y
groups fo were both power-
houses. In the true tradition, they
“didn’t scratch,” but in the words
of their coach: “There are great
future prospects, with a possible
Dick Groat in the making.” This
club will be continued through the
school year with hikes and weiner
roasts planned for spring.

The second group is led by War-
ren Buford and Creighton Peden.
They, too, have had a football and
basketball team which has been
continued for the last three years.
Due to opposing powerhouses, they
are planning to revamp the ath-
letic policy with hopes of getting
in a smaller conference of “beata-
ble” teams.

The third and oldest group is
under the direction of “Coach”
Cooper. This team of Jr. Hi boys
copped the county championship
in basketball this year and have
progressed tremendously. These
boys are planning to organize as a
club later this year, carrying on
unified activities under Cortez’s
guidance.

colored school is in its first year

of organization. During the first],

of this year, chairman Sparks spent
a good deal of time helping the
boys in phys. ed. classes and be-
coming acquainted with them.

Then about two months ago, a}

group was started in the 3rd to
6th grade range under Smitty
Johnston and Kiki Lewis. This
group, the pride and joy of the
committee, turned out en masse
(35) for the first meeting and have
continued to show an avid interest
and amazing progress in all sub-
sequent activities. The school prin-
cipal, Mr. Harris, has given his
full cooperation, putting school
facilities, the gym, and his time
at the committee's disposal.

The second group under Leon
Howell and Reece Middleton is
formed and operated on the gen-
eral ideas of the other groups with
the main emphasis on club work.
Coaches Scott and Whittle have
made most of this club work possi-
ble through their interest, work,
and constructive plans.

This committee is filling a
unique and much needed place in
the community as it with the possi-
ble exception of Scouting, is the
only organization working with
the boys of the community, giving
them a place, leadership, and en-
couragement to develop their in-
dividual talents, whether they be in
the realm of social or athletic
activities. As experienced by their
leaders, these boys have learned
to work and cooperate as a team,
losing their varied individuality in
unified group work and sports.

raised. As for the idea that the amount, if successfully raised
by the Wildcat Club, would be raised by the amount that the
college usually puts into the program, in a never ending
cycle seems to this writer to violate the whole spirit of David-
son alumni interest. .

In ahy case, no matter what position the reader holds,
we would like to re-emphasize the closing statement of the
Trustees’ recent statement which reads as follows: ‘‘We would
call upon the student body, the alumni, and the faculty to
give their loyal support to the athletic director, the coaches,
and the athletic teams of the college to the end that success
may be attained and that intercollegiate sports may again
make their proper and vital contribution to the life of the
institution.”
