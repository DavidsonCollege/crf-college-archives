Foreign
Policies

By Rene DeV. Williamson

German Foreign Policy

It has been characteristic of Ger-
man foreign policy over the years
that it showed at once strength and
weakness. More than in most
countries, German diplomacy has
had to take account of the inter-
nal situation. Even before the
World war, the Reich was pro-
foundly divided, Local - feeling,
based real cultural differences,
was strong; a very

on
short historical
period produced the usual antago-
nism between capital and labor, and
a sharp cleavage between Protes-
tants and Catholics has
with genuine unity. These
divisions were accentuated by
existence of many Germanic groups
living under foreign flags and a
central geographic position expos-
ing the country to interference by
neighboring AS result,
German foreign policy fre-
quently served domestic rather than
external ends. Bismarck, for
stance, united the North and South
Germans by fighting war with
the French, and pre-war economic
imperialism had the desire to pla-
cate German capitalists as one of
its main objectives.
Versailles was imposed on a nation
that was lacking in unity and there-
