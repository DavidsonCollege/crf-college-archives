IS THE PLACE

LOCAL POLITY CLUB
IS BEING PLANNED

Tn 1910 there was established in Bos-
ton a World Peace Foundation which
had for its obtct “the purpose of edu-
cating the people of all nations to a full
knowledge of the waste and destructive-
ness of war, its evil effects on present
social conditions and om the well being
of. future generations, and to promote
international justice and the brotherhood
of man: and generally by every practical
means to promote peace and good will
among all mankind.”

As a part of the program. of the asso-
ciation a number of prominent men are
secured to lecture at many of the col-
leges and universities of the country. In
addition, there has heen formed a= stu-
dent club movement in which there are
organized at various colleges clubs for
the study and discussion of the subjects
coming under the scope of the work of
the foundation. Among the colleges
which have already organized these clubs
are the following prominent institutions

Player Pianos and Player

Rolls, Victor, Edison and

Columbia Talking Ma-
chines and Records.

Strings for all instruments
and thousands of copies
of Sheet Music.

of the country: Amherst, Columbia,
Cornell, Georgia, Harvard, Michigan,
Pennsvlvania, Princeton, South Carolina,
Virginia, Yale.

Plans are now being made for the or-
ganization of such a club at Davidson in
the near future, definite arrangements
for which will be announced later.

INTERESTING HISTORY.

A very interesting letter has been re-
ceived hy Miss Shaw from O. C. Wil-
liamson, a former student at Davidson,
in which he states that at his home they
have the first Bible which was used in
chapel exercises here, and also one of the
tools used in building Chambers build
ing. Mr. Williamson has written about
this matter on account of seeing a notice
of the collection which is being made by
the Blue Pencil Club, and he has kindly
offered to add these articles to this col-
lection,

Mr. Williamson is now principal of
the Laurel Hill High School, Laurel
Hill, N. C.. and the reports from that
county show that he is making quite a
success in his work. He has recently
heen elected president of the Scotland
County Teachers’ Association.
