P. E. PIDDLINGS

Recently a band of Davidson “Young Turks” real-
ized the futility of venting their “time-worn criticisms
against such hallowed bits of Davidsoniana as the ROTC
Department, fraternities and Cop Linker and turned their
barbs to another ivy-choked institution—the physical ed-
ucation program.

‘Through devious means and a host of influential con-
nections, THE DAVIDSONIAN obtained an exclusive in-
terview with an anonymous authority on the physical ed-
ucation department, whose comments proved more than
enlightening.

“First I'd like to say,” our source replied, "that in
the words of that noted philosopher and thinker Plato,
or was it C. W. Stacks, strong mind in a strong body go
hand-in-hand. Everybody knows this. The P.E. program
builds these strong bodies.”

“Take a typical P.E. course,” he continued. “The fel-
lows go down to the gym, work-out and get lots and lots
of exercise. Everyone know you can really get in shape
working-out less than an hour a time every other day.”

“Of course, it would be different if the student just
loped along in these classes. But no sir, that’s not the
case here. Everyone really works hard. The coaches seem
real enthused about the program, organize the classes
well, instruct on the fine points of the games, and really
take an active interest in the program. Of course, things
would be different if these men did not seem so inter-
ested.”

“Another good quality of the program here,” he
added, “is the way the schedule is so well-organized. At
some schools everything is run haphazardly. The classes
are too large, and students just come in and goof around
for the rest of the period. But not here. Things are dif-
ferent at this school.” ,

Leaning Sack in his fat cushioned easy chair, our
source pulled out the keys to his Edsel and set them on
‘his desk, between a “Goldwater for President” button
and his “We love you, trustees” inkwell. Thumbing
through the pages of “The Lefty Driesell Story”, he con-

ued.

“Since the program is so well-run and the students
benefit so much from it, I think it is only fitting that the
department limits the number of free cuts to five. I re-
alize the classes meet three days a week, just like most
academic courses, and that the maximum number of P.E.
cuts is three less than the maximum cuts allowed in a
three hour subject on the Hill, but I feel this difference
is justified.”

_ When asked to explain his arguments for the justifi-
cation, our contact quoted at length from the works of
Aristotle, Mao The-tung and C. W. Stacks for his prem-
ises.

Our source saw nothing wrong with withholding a
degree from a student who fails to complete the P.E. re-
quirement while the school still offers no academic credit
for those worthwhile liours at the gym.

“Physical training has traditionally been a part of a
liberal arts background,” he said. “You wouldn’t grad-
uate a candidate who had not completed his science re-
quirement, or his math requirement, or his language re-
quirement. Then why graduate a boy who has failed to
complete his P.E. requirement? Surely P.E. is just as im-
portant to a college graduate as math or English is. Every
well-equipped doctor, lawyer or businessman needs to

know how to wrestle, play handball and lift weights as ("

much as he needs a knowledge of language or science.”

The source said he is opposed to allowing 11 free
cuts in physical education. “Just because students get 11
cuts in every other three-hour course does not meari they
should get the same number of absences in this valuable
study.”

“If the department allowed 11 free cuts in physical
education, most people would cut the limit. If the stu-
dents were absent 25 per cent of the time, they would
not gain as much from the body building excrcises. Ev-
eryone knows you've got to work-out often to get and
Stay in shape. No one would stay in shape if they loafed
one-fourth of the time.”

“Of course, this argument would not be valid if the
students were not offered a substantial P.E. course. But
since everyone knows the P.E. program here is so vital
and worthwhile, we won’t even consider the arguments
against the cut situation.”

Setting aside his copy of the “Lefty Driesell Story,”
the source picked up “Adventures of a Super-Sid” and
continued.

“Yessir, we have a first-class program here. The
classes are well-organized and small enough so that our
enthusiastic coaches can devote all their time to training
these students in physical training and games. The stu-
dents can get much from them in the way of physical
training and instruction in s a7

“It’s perfectly logical that the classes meet three
times a week and allow only five free cuts, and that P.E.
should be a requirement for graduation. Why in the words
of C. W. Stacks .. .”

“Of course, if all these things were not true, I'd say
there might be some call for change, like maybe enlarg-
ing the number of free cuts or maybe offering some aca-
demic credit as long as the students have to go to the
classes anyway. But no siree, there’s nothing wrong with
our program here. We have a first-rate.set;up. We have
a fine, fine P.E. program—here at Elon.’

MIDSEASON STARTER

O’Neill Clinches Top Slot

for the chance to show what he
could do as a regular. In that
game, his first start, O'Neill
netted 19 big points. It was a
fitting start to an ever lengthen-
ing string of outstanding per-
formances.

Coach Lefty Driesell found his
‘Cats faltering in late Decem-

up of the starting lineup might
provide the change that could
pull his team through the close
ones. O'Neill was working hard

him his chance.

weeks of the season. The longer
I was used as a substitute the

more I worked, trying to earn-

that starting spot,’’ O'Neill said.

Hetzel’s Early Points Pad
Warriors’ Western Waltz

By YATES FAISON
Assistant Sports Editor

GREENSBORO — Fred

Hetzel has been playing

more and enjoying it in di-
rect proportion to his in-
creased duties as a San
Francisco Warrior. And the
secret of his newly-found
success may be the result of
a movie and a diet.

Hetzel has been used this year
by Warrior Coach Bill Sharman
mainly as a first- and third-
quarter starter, alternating his
overall forward duties with Tom
Meschery. Hetzel explains this
by citing his ability this year
to score early. “Early in the
game,”’ he said after Monday
night’s game with the Boston
Celtics here, ‘“‘we try to get the
better early scorers to contrib-
ute their points at the start and
then count on Rick (Barry) to
do the scoring as the game goes
on.”

The value of the movie was
apparent about two weeks ago
when Hetzel and the Warrior
coaches noticed something he
had been doing wrong. “I
found,” said Hetzel, ‘that I was
pushing the ball. not getting
enough backspin on it. Also, I
discovered I was not getting
enough arch on my shots." Since
that time Hetzel has hit over
50 per cent of his attempted
shots. ,

Hetzel was extremely disap-
pointed that he could not be a

first of his. two spectacular
games against West Virginia. In
the first, played in Charlotte,
O'Neill dazzled both the fans
and his Mountaineer opponents
with his soft touch from the
floor, his rebounding and his
foul shooting. When the tension
of the double overtime game
finally lifted, the sizzling sopho-
more had 28 points, including 12
of 13 from the free throw line,
and his Wildcats had edged out
WVU.

He followed this game with
strong performances against The
Citadel, VPI. and Wake Forest.
ringing up 13, 11 and 22 points
respectively. The games set the
stage for his return engagement
with West Virginia.

Playing on the Morgantown
hardwoods, which he described
as the roughest court he had
ever played on. O'Neill made
the game an encore of his first
performance. This time he was
eight for eight from the line. and
again he scored a scorching 28
points. His ‘Cats were on the
short end of the score, but with
O'Neill's help, they nearly engi-
neered a great comeback.

The final score was. 86-83. but
no one who saw or heard the
game could help being impress-
ed by O'Neill's coolness and his
soft touch. His performances
since his first start leave little
doubt that he deserves the first
team spot completely.

Driesell has called O'Neill the

—

best shot on the team this sea-
son. He has been living up to
this praise by hitting nearly 50
per cent of his shots from the
floor. His free throw percentage
is around the 80 per cent mark.
O'Neill's smooth and soft shot
is beautiful to watch and deadly
accurate.

He does not amaze people with
his speed or his jumping ability,
yet he is a real ball hawk and a
first rate rebounder. His team-
mate Wayne Huckel said, ‘He
is great at blocking out for posi-
tion on the boards. He gets a
lot of rebounds without needing
to jump very high.”

O'Neill leaves little doubt
about his defensive ability eith-
er. Looking again to his two
games against WVU, both games
he has guarded Dave Reaser,
West Virginia's leading scorer
for the season. In the first game
Reaser put in only 10 over the
hands of O'Neill and in their
second clash he was able to net
only seven.

Since he played several games
as a substitute before he began
Starting. O'Neill's overall aver-
age is only 19.8 points per game.
But as a starter his average is
over 17 ‘a game, making him a
team leader.

Another teammate, Dave Mos-
er, said. “Having Mike in the
lineup really helps a lot. He
adds rebounding strength and
gives us improvement all
around.”’ Huckel added. ‘‘I knew

its his improvement in part to a

diet-exercise program during the
summer arranged by Sharman
and aided by Meschery. But he
hastened to add, ‘Of course
there’s nothing like experience
to build confidence.”

Hetzel’s improvement can be
seen in his shooting percentage
as compared with that of last
season, which was also ham-
pered by a finger injury. His
1965-66 contribution was a poor
37 per cent, but this year he is
hovering around the 50 per cent
mark after finding himself and

According to members of the
Warriors’ traveling press, one
of the big factors in the Celtics’
handling of the Warriors was
the height and strength disad-
vantage which Hetzel would
have helped to balance.

Although most of the Greens-
boro fans were interested in
watching the performance of
former Duke star Jeff Mullins,

he could prove himself if he got
the chance. He gives us an ex:
tra outside scoring threat."

O'Neill himself commented on
the rest of Davidson’s season:
“We can beat West Virginia.
Our overall record is now such
that our goal is to win the South-
ern Conference tournament de-
fending our championship. I
think we will win the tourna-
ment.”
