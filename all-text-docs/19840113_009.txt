Hissam Leads Wrestlers In A Rebuilding Season

By STEVE BYERS
Wrestling Coach Vince Arduini des-
cribes the upcoming season best when he
says, “It’s going to be a struggle.” With
only eight wrestlers on this year’s team,
any dual matches are almost guaranteed
losses.

ment team.” There is one thing, how-
ever, of which Arduini can be certain.
The team’s fortunes ride on the back of
senior Tom Hissam.

Last year Hissam finished third in his
weight class in the Southern Conference
tournament and third in the NAIA Dis-

Junior co-captain Mike Keeley views
the season in an optimistic light, though:

this season. But he is not a one-man
team. Senior John Breidenstine and
Keeley are being counted on for victories
and leadership, and the other five
wrestlers all have the ability to contrib-
wie.

Arduini sees the team’s schedule,
which runs from Jan. 11 to Feb. 25, as
demanding, with Elon, Washington and
Lee, and the University of the South
being especially tough. Although the
team will be rewarded only through the
individual awards which — Hissam,
Breidenstine, or Keeley may receive,
Arduini remains proud of the team’s
commitment to the sport. In his second
year as head coach of the program, Ar-

duini admires his current group of
wrestlers and the inherent pressures
which they must overcome to succeed.

Davidson’s wrestling program is
hampered in many ways: lack of scholar-
ships, grueling physical demands of the
sport (not the least of which is having to
make a certain weight by a certain time),
and the omnipresent academic pressures
of Davidson on top of all else. Eight
wrestlers may not be many, but it is a tri-
bute to Arduini and the program that
there are eight guys willing to give so
much of themselves with little hope of
team success. In other words, support the
wrestlers when they have a match at
home. They deserve it.

Lady Cats Now 0-7

By DAVID RESNIK

They may be down, but they're not
out. Davidson's basketball
now has a record of 0-7, but coach Pat
Daley said her team has remained en-
thusiastic and continues to improve.

The team played no games over the
holidays and came back for two days ol

women's

practice earlier this week. The Ladycats
played at Coker last night and have a
home game at UNC-Asheville at 7 p.m.
tonight.

Daley said her team is concentrating
on individual and group improvement,
and she hopes they will continue to im-
prove as the season progresses.

This week’s Athlete of the Week is
Kenny Wilson, who was also named
Southern Conference Player of the
Week. Over Christmas break Wilson
led the Wildcats to a comeback win
over Furman and a one-point upset of
the University of South Carolina.
Against USC he scored 29 of the
team’s 53 points.

In a 61-56 loss to rival UNC-Char-
lotte Monday he pulled down five re-
bounds and was the game’s high scorer
with 23 points, including eight straight
points which sparked a second-half
