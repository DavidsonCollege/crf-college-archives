Altho some hundred Auburn students
journeyed with their team to Atlanta to
see Auburn beat up D. C., history shows
that the whole student “body and their
faculty were needed. Coach Fetzer took
only twenty-two men, but they proved
sufficient to take Auburn's measure fer
a made-to-order licking 21-7. For it
war-time general of a war-time eleven
Spann proved a regular von Hindenburg.
Auburn’s line, some twenty pounds per
man heavier than Davidson’s, was hard

to pierce, but Spann’'s aerial attack a ta’}

Zeppelin, his submarine burrowing thru
the Plainsmen’s line and = the cavalry
charges like those of war-horses “Burns
and Flowers. incorporated,” were too
much for Auburn. ,For Auburn, Diicote
was the particular star; most of her
gains may be charged up to him. The
workings of Spann, King, Burns and
Flowers on the offensive. and Shaw.
Grey, Elliot and Crouch Brothers on the
defensive, were mainly responsible for
Davidson's victory. Grey's punting and
the running back of Flowers gave Dav-
idson about 20 yards on each exchange
of punts. A fumble by Donohue, re-
covered by King gave Davidson her sec-
and touchdown. When the whistle blew
ending the game. Auburn bade the South-
ern championship a’ fond farewell.

= table to stop the Baptist’s rush and were
scored oo twice, tho managing to win
out in the last quarter. “Phe game with
Wake Forest Saturday, even with the
ddds_ tavoring Davidson, should) be a
fight worth seeing. Davidson's line-up
will probably be the same as that in the
Auburn game. Davidson will be out
for blood, so watch out, Baptists!

Wake Forest’s team will) probably
line-up as follows: — Bowers, left end:
Gary, left tackle; Williams, left guard;
Blankenship, center: Croon, right guard ;
Savage, npht tackle; Feezer, right end:
Pace, A. quarterback > Rabenhorst, lett
