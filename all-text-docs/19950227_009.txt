THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1995

“The opinions being expressed
are not necessarily the views of...”
We have all heard this disclaimer
used by radio and television sta-
tions alike. The editors of The
Davidsonian have printed a similar
one concerning the Opinions sec-
tion. I often wonder if this would
be a good opening to my articles.

We live in a time when being
black forfeits your right to indi-
viduality. A black person commit-
ting a crime is just that, a black
criminal. He is not seen as Jeffrey
Dahmer or David Koresh, the sick
individual who killed many people.
Clarence Thomas is the black Su-
preme Court justice. O.J. Simpson
is the black, ex-football player ac-
cused of murder. J.C. Watts is the
“black Republican. Ike Bailey is the
black editorial writer. Simply put,
if you are black, you are black. If
you are white, you are far more
individualized.

Individuation: “The act or pro-
cess of individuating, especially
the process by which social indi-
viduals become differentiated from
one another; the distinction or de-

termination of the individual within
the general or universal.” Being
placed in the public eye is a pecu-
liar spot for most African-Ameri-
cans. The moment something is
said or done, you are seen as a black
person first and almost never as an
individual.

My greatest difficulty lies in
trying to be an outspoken writer
and not to be seen as a spokesper-
son. I am forced to be African and
American. I am forced to be Ike
Bailey the black man and not Ike
Bailey the individual. When I get
responses to my articles they seem
to be more focused on the African-
American race and less on my indi-
vidual position. People have told
me to shut-up about all that “racial
stuff’ that no one wants to hear,
and I have been told to continue

Building Community

William Raspberry’s speech
was arefreshing, non-partisan look
at America’s problems. Instead of
demonizing either political party,
Raspberry spoke about the politics
of victimization and how special
benefits accorded to various pro-
tected groups divide society. He
commented on how public offi-
cials, instead of focusing their at-
tention on problems, portray their
opponents as enemies. Raspberry
identified the basic problem facing
public life: how people villanize
those who disagree with them to
avoid meaningful dialogue. His
diagnosis was on the mark but pre-
scriptions for building community
were lacking.

How does one build a liveable
neighborhood? This is a difficult
question, one Raspberry avoided
answering directly. Certainly there
is not a precise formula or recipe
for building community. But by

' taking certain actions, a commu-
nity can bring itself together:
Acknowledge that government
must not play an artificial, central
role; institutions do not make a
close community.

Rather than stress differences
among groups, show how these
differences are unimportant when
building community. :
Use the power of elected office to
articulate values that have been
lost in ideological struggles: trust,
respect, self-control, responsibil-
ity. Policies should uphold these
values.

Promote a climate where small,
locally owned businesses can
thrive. This means reducing taxes
or regulations when possible. Lo-
cal businesses are the backbone of
any healthy community, for these
merchants know their customers.
Design communities to maximize

interaction among residents. An

article in the Sunday Observer ad-
dressed this urban planning in con-
siderable detail.

Have corporations provide seed
money for community initiatives,
such as programs to bring high
school students from around a city

to discuss issues they encounter in
their schools. A high school might
-agree to start an exchange program
with a school from another part of
a community.
Urge suburban churches who have
abandoned their outreach roles to
put their resources in poorer areas
of the community. A church from
one areacan “adopt” achurch from
another area. This instantly bring:
two networks together. :
These solutions are ideas that
Ihave personally seen address com-
munity needs and bring people to-
gether. Many of these solutions
are institutional. By using effec-
tive public policy and their “bully
pulpit” to call for change and praise
those who build community, lead-
ers Can promote conditions where
community matters to people.
Clean, safe streets, drug-free neigh-

borhoods, economicdevelopment, -

and parks are all the results of
institutional change. But for all its
virtues, mere institutional compe-
tence does not build community.

What is most important in
building community is achange in
attitude. Families and local groups
determine their own strength; gov-
ernment determines only the con-
ditions in which these groups ex-
ist. Community arises not from
leaders and programs but from the
selfless actions of ordinary people
acting locally. This is why build-
ing community is so difficult—
this local initiative cannot be gen-
erated at will. Solutions proposed
by the business community and
government are only successful
when peoplewant to build com-
munity, when there citizen leader-
ship along with attempts to change
conditions.

As Carl Holman, former presi-
dent of the National Urban Coali-
tion, said, “City services and strat-
egies can prevent decay only in
neighborhoods that have confi-
dence in their own future.” Real
community is possible only when
a sense of place matters enough to
residents that they take action on
their own.

because it makes African-Ameri-
can life here easier. Does Bill
Gullan or Ken May have the same
problem? Are they seen as the
white editorial writers? Orare they
seen as the boisterous editorial
writers?

This does not mean I want to
forfeit my blackness in order to
become an individual. I should not
have to make sucha choice, I want
to be seen as an African-American
student who writes, and not as the
African-American representative.
Yet I know that this is not possible.

Irealize my need for individu-
ality, yet I know I am a part of the
“Undifferentiated Blob” (a term
used by Cornel West). My friends
urge me not to turn white, and I am
told not to be too black. What can
anyone do in such a situation? I

want to be black first, but not black
only.

If seeing my struggle for iden-
tity helps you see the bigger pic-
ture, then this process is worth-
while. If seeing me as the A frican-
American editorial writer allows
you to see ourstruggle more clearly,
then I can accept this. But you
must always remember, to know
me is to know an African-Ameri-
can; to know me is not to know an
entire race.

W..E. B. Dubois’ notion of
double-consciousness says it quite
clearly: “The Negro is a sort of
seventh son, born with a veil, and
gifted with second-sight in this
American world, a world which
yields him-no true self-conscious-
ness, but only lets him see himself
through the revelation of the other
world.

It is a peculiar sensation, this
double-consciousness, this sense
of always looking at one’s self
through the eyes of others, of mea-
suring one’s soul by the tape of a
world that looks on in amused con-
tempt and pity.”

Rappaz kan bring

da werld tagetha

Just like any other musical
genre, some rappers produce gar-
bage and others produce worth-
while music. It’s equivalent to the
difference between Milli Vanilli
(What did that name ever mean,
anyway?) and Boyz II Men. But
look at the spelling of that: Boyz II
Men. What gives? Why do some
rappers, like Boyz II Men, mis-
spell their names and song titles?

What does it prove? Are they in

need of copy editors? Do they
simply need a seventh-grade typ-
ing course?

From Eazy-E’s album It’s on
(Br-DBre) 187um Killa come the
following song titles: “Exxtra Spe-
cial Thankz,” “Any Last Werdz,”

“Boyz N Tha Hood (G-Mix),” and .

“Down 2 Tha Last Roach.” Per-
haps Eazy was concerned that the
letter “z” simply receives too little
use. Perhaps Eazy thought he was
being more creative than all the
other rappers by spelling “the” with
an “a.” Perhaps Eazy finds it dif-
ficult to distinguish between let-
ters and numbers.

Finally, my tour of rap’s great-
est grammarians concludes with
Onyx. Not only does Onyx follow

the same principles of spelling as
Eazy-E, sometimes they can’teven
find the space bar on the keyboard.
Take the title track
“BACDAFU*UP,” or the second
song, “BICHASNIGUZ.” Orother
spellings to rival Dan Quayle:
“ATAK OF DA BAL-HEDZ.”
Really it’s very original, especially
the no-spaces part, which reminds
me of the last chapter from Joyce’s
Ulysses. Certainly that’s what
Onyx meant also.
~ On second thought, I find
myself wondering if I’m simply
being too bitter. Maybe rappers
have a greater purpose for their
spelling mistakes. Or maybe they
are just human. Everyone, rappers
and non-rappers alike, has the abil-
ity to misspell. When we begin to
search for those things we share in
common rather than dwell on
things like grammar and spelling
which are divisive, only then will
we experience harmony and unity.
Eazy, Onyx and their fellow
rappers are not bad spellers —
they are visionaries, They are try-
ing to bring about understanding.
Or maybe, just maybe, rappaz
kant spel.

No
woman,
no cry

Over the past couple of years
I have noticed a very disturbing
trend in my life; I pretty much
never hook up. At first, I thought

‘it might have something to do with

me, but after talking with some of
my friends I realized they were
having similar troubles. So, forthe
good of us all, I setabout to find out
just what in the world is going on.

I started at the beginning of
the hook process, Court parties.
This has been the stalking ground
of guys like myself in search of
young, drunken co-eds to bring

back to “the cave.” The parties,

though, haven’t changed a bit.
They’re as lame as usual, but not
really any worse: And, believe it
or not, enticing women back to my
room hasn’t been my problem. The

/ difficulties occur once we get there.

I mean, I can bring girls home, but
I can’t close the deal. I can hook
the fish, but I can’t get her in the
boat. I can get my ball on the
green, but I can’t sink my putt. I
can... oh, you get the picture.
So the trouble comes in the

room, Whatchanges there? That’s
easy, it’s the music, In the good

~ ole’ days .we’d get back to my

place, sit on the couch, and I'd hit
play on my already programmed
CD changer.

Here’s a sample. We'd start
of with something like “we’ve got
tonight, whoneeds tomorrow, we’ ll
make it last, why don’t you stay . .
.’ (who can argue with the wisdom
oof Bob Seager?). Then my stereo
would break into alittle “Tonight’s
the Night.” It worked for Rod
Stewart, and it worked for me.
Follow that up with some Joe
Cocker, preferably “Love Lifts Us
Up Where We Belong” (my loft),
and its a done deal. No more.

Nowadays when I get a girl
back, all they want to listen to are
bands like Pearl Jam, Nirvana, or
anything with “rage, anger, and
emotion.” Since my CD collection
hasn’t grown since the tenth grade,
I don’t have any of that stuff. It’s
a fact. I’ve missed the boat on 90s
music so much that I couldn’t catch
up if I were Mark Spitz. Being the
desperate guy that I am, however,
I try to compensate. Bad idea.

Ifit’srage and angerthey want,
it’s rage and anger they will get.
My usual selection is Michael
Jackson’s "Beat It." He seems
pretty angry atsomething, wouldn’t
you agree? Unfortunately, I have
never gotten more than 15 seconds
into the song before my compan-
ion informs me that I am the big-
gest loser north of the South Pole.
Then she leaves.

Pat Benatar was right all along.
Love is a battlefield. I guess that
makes me France. Oh well, I’m
getting used to it. All you guys
who are still spelling “fish” with
an “f” had better get used to it too.
