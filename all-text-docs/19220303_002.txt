Court Gossip

Last week the Wildcats returned from
the first 100 per cent trip ever taken by a
Davidson basketball team. They won
every game on foreign courts,. beating
two of the best teams in South Carolina.

—Wildcats—

This year’s basket tossers have won
three-fourths of their -games:—Only-one
team has made more géals from the floor
than Coach Hengeveld’s “Arsenic Ag-
gregation.” That team was Guilford.
Elon and Trinity bested the Wildcats on
their own courts by superior foul shoot-
ing.

—Wildcats—

Total points, Davidson 378; Opponents
300.

—Wildcats—

In the spring a young man’s fancy
lightly turns to thought of—Baseball.
Get out the old spiked shoes and worn
glove and help Coach Hengeveld put out
another winning combination.

—Wildcats— ° ~,

The Wofford-Davidson game in Spar-
tanburg was an example of the old Da-
vidson pep and fight. The score was tied
no less than seven times during the fray.
Wofford led at the end of the first half
by five points, but the Wildcats staged
a comeback and led at the close of the
game by five points.

—Wildcats—

To Coach Hengeveld is due most of the
credit for the smoothness with which the
basketball team works and also their
never-say-die fighting spirit. Hats off to
our All-American coach who is a true
Davidson man in every respect.

—Wildcats—

Let’s get in behind the track team this
spring and help Coach Grey win the
state honors. The prospects are bright
and the proper support will help bring
home the bacon.

WILDCATS CLOSE

FINE SEASON

(Continued from page 1)
Wofford Game.

After trailing the Wofford Terriers
for three quarters of the game the Wild-
cat quint, led by Cap Pat, unloosed a
whirlwind attack and annexed the sec-
ond straight game from the Methodists
30-25 in a fast and peppery contest at
Spartanburg last Wednesday night.

Seven times during the fray the count
was knotted, but by accurate passing
and sure shooting the Presbyterians
forged ahead and trimmed the Method-
ists by a quintet of counters.

The Wofford quint started off strong
and held the Wildcats down during the
initial period, holding the long end of a
13-8 count at the intermission. The 13
proved to be the Terriers’ jinx and the
Wildcats pawed and clawed their way
through the Terriers, piling up 22 points
to 12 during the second spasm. The
Poison Squad was at sea on the small
floor during the first half but in the final
period they hit their stride and left the
Terriers hopelessly in the rear. Cap Pat
led the attack during the final session
and coming up the floor he caged four

baskets, bewildering the Terriers by his

floor work, Playing running guard, he
ran through the Methodists’ defense and
shot the sphere through the meshes time
after time. Besides Pat’s offensive work
in the second half, which the Wofford
quint was unable to stop, Warhoss
Mauze at center played a pretty game
for the Red and Black. Collins and Dil-
lingham were the individual stars for
the losers, each garnering eight points
apiece. -

The Terriers showed splendid team
work but were unable to keep the Red
and Black inside their defense and as
a result the Wildcats were able to pile
up the score. Although the teams were
scrapping every minute, only four fouls
were called on Wofford and seven on
Davidson. . Warhoss converted two of
these into counters, while Lindsey rang
up five.

The entire Wildcat quint played fine
basketball, showing skill in passing and
speed on the floor. Curtis Ormond, at
forward, played a steady game and add-
ed four tallys to the Presbyterians’
score. Warhoss and Pat each dumped
in five from the field, but Warhoss with
two foul goals to his credit gained high
point honors for the evening. Beall and
Mallory also showed up well at the other
forward position, while Junebug played
a good game at guard.

« Wake Forest Game.

“We have met the enemy and they are
curs.” The immortal words of Commo-
dore Perry were never more appropriate
than they were last Monday night, when
Dutch . Hengeveld’s Battling Poison
Sauad triumphed over Wake Forest by
the count. of 36-27. The game was the
roughest and yet the fastest played on
the local court this year.

There are “breaks” in every basket-
ball game, and Monday’s was no excep-
tion. The Wildcat’s guardian angel was
on the job, and even the most ardent
Red and Black rooter will have to ad-
mit that Davdson got her share of the
breaks. But any crew that can hang up
a nine-point victory over a team that has
the scalps of Elon, Guilford, State and
others hanging in their trophy room,
must have something in its system be-
sides horseshoes and four-leaf clovers.

Slashing, driving and battling with a
determination that has resulted in the
best team in the history of the school,
the Wildcats went wild. Captain Pat
Crawford went worse than wild, tearing
up the floor with the speed of a fiend,
ringing up spectacular shots from all
corners of the floor and smashing into
every play that gave promise of result-
ing in Wake Forest counters. The pre-
mier guard in the state hung up six field
goals.

After being on the, short end of the
count for the majority of the_first half,
Davidson made a desperate rally, tying
the count 18-18, The score was tied five
times in this half. The second session
started much like the first, Crawford
keeping the Wildcats in the running by
“meshing” three long ones. Ormond
then chipped in witha trio of field goals
and the count stood 30-27 with three min-
utes to play. Ole Warhoss Mauze then
awoke from his lethargy and carried on
right nobly, making six points and put-
ting the game on ice.

season... When they started they seemed
to be unstopable, but both had difficulty
in locating the goal. Carlyle also played
well, making 17 points. Nine of these,
however, were from the 15-foot line.
Ormond and Mauze, in addition to
Captain Crawford, rendered. the most
spectacular performances for Davidson.
Davis also fought like a demon but was
put out of the game on personal fouls.

in the realms of college debating.

Davidson and Randolph-Macon have
met in forensic struggle on two former
occasions. The first of these debates
was held in 1920 at Ashland, Va., and the
judges awarded the decision to Ran-
delph-Macon. The.second debate was
held last spring at Davidsonyjand David-
son received the decision. The winner
of the coming debate will, therefore, be
the winner of the series between the two
colleges. In order to make it as fair
as possible to each college the debate
will be held in neutral territory.

METROPHILIANS STAGE A
MOCK TRIAL
OF INTEREST

The largest crowd ever seen at the
Metrophilian Society was present at the
last meeting to witness a mock tral.
Defendant P. C. Henderson was charged
by the plaintiff, J. R. Abernethy, with
having made the false statement that the
said plaintiff had “never cracked a book”
at Davidson, and the defendant was be-
ing sued for slander to the amount of
fifty thousand dollars. The attorneys for
the defense were Fred Smith and Bern-
hardt, while Parks and Wooten repre-
sented the plaintiff. Prof, A. Currie pre-
sided over the court and Sheriff Kimsey
had difficulty keeping order until he
had marched one offender up to the
judge’s bench. and fined him ten dollars
for disorderly conduct.

There was very little trouble experi-
enced in getting a competent jury, al-
though one would-be juryman was dis-
gharged for having failed to pay his last
year’s taxes. None claimed kin ~with
either plaintiff or defendant, and those
asked were able to prove they were over
twenty-one. The jury was impanelled

by the clerk, John Adams, and the trial
began.

The plaintiff maintained that the de-
fendant’s false words had caused him
(the plaintiff) great mortification, and
loss of caste among his fellows, and had
brought about his father’s. disinheriting
him. The defense based its case on the
truth of the defendant’s words. Wit-
nesses were freely used by both sides.
When all the evidence was in, Judge
Currie charged the jury that if Hender-
son’s statement was true, he was thereby
acquitted; if untrue, it was up to the
jury to determine the amount of dam-
ages. he jury brought in the verdict
that the defendant’s statement was true,
and Henderson was automatically ac-
quitted.

PI KAPPA ALPHA HALL IS BE-
ING GIVEN A NEW DRESS

The local chapter of the Pi Kappa Alpha
Fraternity has just finished a complete
renovation of their chapter hall. AlI-
though the hall, previous to the refinish-
ing, was not in bad condition, it has now
been made one of the most beautiful
halls on the campus.

The upper woodwork is ‘finished in
white enamel, contrasted with the ma-
hogany finish of the panelling below.
The ceiling is papered in white, while
the upper part of the walls are covered
with paper of a light bluish tint. The
paper between the lower panels is on
the order of brown tapestry. The hard-
wood floor was scraped, filled and var-
nished. New electric light fixtures, rugs,
and draperies, have been ordered to
complete the new furnishings.
