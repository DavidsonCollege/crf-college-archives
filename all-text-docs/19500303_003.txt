Humanities Hold Key
To Our Future, Says
Princeton's Dodds

Princeton, N. J. —(I. P.)— De-
ploring the decline of liberal edu-
cation in the nation’s universities,
Dr. Harold W. Dodds, president of
Princeton University, recently said
that “if widespread knowledge and
appreciation of the humanities dis-
appear, our modern civilization can
only return to a new dark age of
sordid, animal existence.”

President Dodds declared that the
College of Liberal Arts and. Scien-
ces remains “our most promising

soci:! agency for combatting °}

worm’s eye viéw of life.’ He’ at-
tacked the faulty teaching of the
humanities as suffering from har.
ening of the intellectual . arteries
and said a liberal education. is the
“golden theme” which fits man to
be a competent leader in the broad
area of human affairs.

Dr. Dodds said that Colleges of
Liberal Arts and Sciences in the
country’s universities are divided as
to methods and objectives, with a
future more uncertain than that of
vocational and professional schools.
“Yet it is through the liberal stud-
ies that one comes into association
with the uncommon and the great
in our intellectual inheritance,” he
said.

Dr. Dodds pointed to literature,
art, history, and philosophy as ex-
pressing a nature which is basically
and exclusively human. He declar-
ed that “politics, economics, and so-
ciology can never ignore this fact.”

Wisconsin Students

Kir Views of Faculty
Procedure on Exams.

Madison, Wis. —(IP)—A recent
discussion by the University of
Wisconsin’s Committee on Univer-
sity Functions and Policies center-
ed on Chapter 4 of the Committee’s
voluminous “report card,” which
has aroused nationwide interest
since its publication last fall. The
committee found that in size of
teaching sections, “you just can’t
win.”

“Sometimes the University is
charged with such great size that
the individual receives no attention
and other times with wasting mon-
ey on many small classes.” The
committee felt that in the Univer-
sity now there are a number of
lectures that are too large, the size
of quiz and laboratory sections in
large courses is reasonably satisfac.

Alexander Questions
‘Y' Program Progress

Are you familier with the pro-
gram of your YMCA? The YMCA
is keenly aware of the problem this
question involves.

Recently the hall prayer mecting
leaders conducted a discussion on
the work of the YMCA designed
to accentuate both positive and ad-
verse criticism. Randy Taylor, cabi-
net leader in charge of spiritual de-
velopment, carefully compiled the
student opinion as recorded, which
was presented to the cabinet as a
whole. The details were scrutinized
thoughtfully by the Cabinet but
particularly revelatory was the gen-
eral feeling that the student body
did not know enough abont the “Y".

Possibly there are two extenuat-
ing reasons: first, the YMCA is
not yet physically in the center of
student body life; second, the pub-
licizing of an organization as com-
plex and extensive as the YMCA
bas its limitations.

One of the principal limitations
is the propensity of students to ex-
onerate themselves of all blame. Be-
ginning with this issue, the DAV-
IDSONITIAN is carrying an article
every week on some phase o!
YMCA work. Students are invit-
ed to find out more about their
YMCA’s activities by looking for
this article and reading it intel-
ligently.

Library Featuring
New B Books: on hats

The Davidson College J.ibrary
has received within recent days a
number of new’ books which are
proving popular witli student read-
ers. Among these books are sever-
al on the subjects of Art, which is
this month's display in the Refer-
ence Room, and Music.

If you are lookipg for laughs as
well as an understanding of the
problem of what others think of the
United States, try, “Out of the
Crocodile’s Mouth” a collection of
Russian cartoons depicting life in
America as seen through Russian
eyes. The collection which is made
of cartoons appearing in the Mos-
cow humor magazine “Krokodil’
is edited by William Nelson and
although only recently released has
been acclaimed by critics as one
of the finest books of its type ever
printed. It is a wonderful presenta-
tion of “misrepresentation.”

In the field of serious Art, the
[ibrary has added what has been
termed by many “one of the great-
est achievements in the field of art
publication,” “The Paintings of El
Greco.’ El Greco is the most mod-
ern of alt the Old Masters and this
publication is a truly monumental
edition, designed to do ample jus-
tice to his importance. This volume
contains plates of all the Master's
principal works, together with one
hundred detail reproductions, mostly
in their actual size. Thus for the
first time El Greco's works can real-
ly be “seen.”

ST. LOUIS, VETERAN FOOTBALL
EXPONENT, DROPS GAME FROM
SPORTS LIST AFTER INQUIRY

St. Louis, Mo. (IP)—Saint Louis
University, which participated in
the first intercollegiate football
game west of the Mississippi in
1888, has dropped football “for the
immediate future,” according to the
Very Rev. Paul C, Reinert, S. J.,
president.

“The University is unwilling to
submit to scholastic compromises,”
Father. Reinert’ declared in an-
nouncing the decision. “Experience
seems to show that today if a large
university is to meet its highly
specialized football rivals on an
equal basis, it is almost imperagive
that scholastic sacrifices be de-
liberately accepted.”

Pointing out that “the propor-
tions that college fooball has as-
sumed today demand that an insti-
tution place its program on a rigo-

rous business basis,” Father Rein-
ert ‘said: “In a private institution
of higher learning which in view
of present economic trends is forced
to husband its funds with the ut-
most diligence, any channeling
of resources from essential academic
objectives of general and profes-
sional training’ into areas of
secondary importance such as inter-
collegiate football could not be justi-
fied.”

Action was taken following a poll
of alumni leaders, regents and
deans, faculty members, and = the

Heads Heart Ass'n;
Describes Ailments

New Haven, Conn, —- The gen.
eral public must be taught the
truth about heart disease so that
individuals will “not be frightened
according to a Yale
University doctor.

Dr. Harold M, Marvin, President
of the American Heart Association,
an Alimnus of ‘Davidson College,
asserted that medical investigutors
have learned that so-called “heart
attacks” are nat fatal or disabling
except in a small percentage of
cases, that high blood pressure is
not the terrifying condition it was
once thought to be, and that thou.
sands of men and women with heart
disease are leading. active _ lives
without discomfort,

“An intelligent understanding,”
Dr. Marvin said, “would lead thou-
sands of lay people to participate in
the work of local groups, where
they are sorely needed, After all,
this battle against our greatest
health problem must be fought by
all the people, not just by the doc-
tors; unless thousands of citizens
give their help we cannot hope for
an early or decisive victory.”

Dr. Marvin, who is also Asso.
ciate Clinical Professor of Medi-
cine at Yale, discussed the fight
ayainst heart’ disease on the weekly
radid program “Yale Interprets the
News,” over Station WTIC.

Althoygh deaths from heart dis-
ease have been on the increase, Dr.
Marvin looked upon the overat:
picture as “far more encouraging”
than one might expect from the
death rates alone. aN

The Yale heart expert described
the five types of heart illnesses that
are frequent enough to be consider-
ed health problems. They are: (1)
congenital heart disease — the king
that is present at birth, and ac
counts for two or three percent
of all heart disease; (2) the type
caused by syphilis, responsible for
six to eight percent; (3) rheumatic
heart disease, accounting for 90 per
cent of all heart disease in childhood
and early adult life; (4) the type
caused by high blood pressure; and
(S) the kind caused by hardening

Former Davidsonian|Sindent Government

Counters Immaturity

Salem, Ore. (1?)—Student gov-

ernment is an ‘integral aid in the
business of administering college.”
declared Rev. Robert H. Sweeney,
vice-president of the University ot
Portland, in a recent address be-
fore delegates to the Oregon Fed-
eration of Collegiate Leaders as-
sembled on. the campus at Wibl-
liamette University.
- Every college needs dynamic stu-
dent government, he said, not to
replace the
sional staff, but to work with them
and develop leadership among the
students. Rev. Sweency said that
“stodgy educators” are. wary of
strong student government. because
they have the suspicion that stu-
dent judgment is always going to
be immature: He went on to say
that the very way to get immature
jndgment is to expect it.

The ogligation of the college,
Rev. Sweeney explained, is to pro-
duce not only good business men,
professional men, teachers anil
technicians but -“men and women
who are imbued with enlighten-
ment of leadership.” He feels that
“any administration not aimed at
leadership should not be in the
business.”

cries.

Congenital heart disease and the
kind caused by high blood pressure
are not increasing, Dr. Marvin stat-
ed. Syphilitic heart disease has ‘de-
creased in recent years and there
are indications that rheumatic heart
disease also is slowly declining.

Dr. Marvin explained that arter-
iosclerosis — hardening of the ar-
teries — occurs largely in advanced
ages, The average age of American
people has increased “almost wun.
believably” since 1900. More and
more people are living to 60, 70, 75,
or even 80 years,

“At these ages one must expect
death to come from one of the dis-
eases or conditions common to later
life, and of these, hardening of the
arteries is the commonest,” he
