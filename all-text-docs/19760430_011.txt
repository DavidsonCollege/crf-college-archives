Small sports boast recruits,
bring power, depth to Cats

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor

Football and basketball re-
cruits usually capture the
headlines but this year David-
son’s smaller sports programs
have yielded a large number of
talented recruits.

Swimming coach, Pat
Drake, has taken the peren-
nially passive swimming pro-
gram and hopefully given it
new life. Drake is fairly confi-
dent that around eight swim-
mers will have opted for
Davidson by the May lst
deadline and feels that number
may increase.

This is the first time David-
son has actively recruited
swimming talent.

Drake feels that the recruits
will enable Davidson to field a
more competitive team next
season.

‘‘Some of the recruits will
provide good depth and I’ve
got about five more that are
like Jonathon Washburn who
holds several school records.”

Definitely coming next year
is Mike Verwest from Fort
Meyers, Florida who is pri-
marily a distance swimmer.

His high school times in tha’

500, 1000, and 1650 yard
events would all be Davidson
school records.

Also coming is Mark Tom-
merdahl who excels in the
Butterfly and Intermediate
Medley events. In addition his
long distance times are better
than Verwest’s. _

With next year’s influx of
talent Drake looks forward to
a good season with more
teams of Davidson’s calibre on
the schedule.

better and I would say that
we'll be getting closer to VMI,
Appalachian, The Citadel, and
William and Mary.”

Davidson’s Southern Confe-
rence Championship tennis
team loses only a single senior,
John Mitchell, next year but
will also lose the services of
two sophomores and a junior.

As a result, tennis coach
Jeff Frank will need some
good recruits for depth in
1977.

Four players are definitely
coming next year. Lard Cast-
elein from Holland, Jeff Cyle
of Princeton, New Jersey,
Rick Johnson from New
Canaan, Connecticut, and Jeff
Flair from Chapel Hill, North
Carolina will all be counted on
heavily to fill the void.

Academic standards pose:

serious problems for coaches
trying to bring talented athle-
tics into Davidson. Also the
lack of scholarships weakens a
coach’s bargaining position
and Frank feels that David-
son’s stand with the Southern
standards poses serious prob-
lems for coaches trying to
bring talented athletes into
Davidson. Also the lack ‘of
scholarships weakens a

coach’s bargaining position
and Frank feels that Davidson
stand with the Southern Cen-
ference will determine his need
for scholarships.

“T think we need to see some
scholarships given if we’re
going to stay with the
Southern Conference. But if
we get out of the conference I
feel certain we can get by with
the existing program.”

Chip Stone’s soccer pro-
gram suffered a _ dismal
season last fall but the situa-
tion looks somewhat. brighter,
with the recruiting of several
potent offensive players.

Stone has recruited several
All-League and All-State
players from New York and
New Jersey. Grey Weir and
Barry Sathjen, both from
Bronxville, N.Y., are an out-
standing striker-goalie combi-
nation that played together in
high school.

Coach Stone feels that the
incoming freshmen will help
his team in a number of ways.

“These guys all rate now *

with anyone on our team and
they will push our starters a
little harder. In addition, they

will give the team’ greater’
depth,” he noted.

By BILL WINKENWERDER ss The Citadel then rallied for
Staff Writer three runs to grab a 5-2
margin. In the final inning

The Davidson Wildcat base-

ball team finished its season
10-22 by whipping Guilford
13-10 and losing to conference
opponent the Citadel 3-5.

The Wildcat batters un-
loaded their artillery on Satur-
day as they shelled Guilford
pitchers for 17 hits, four of
which were home runs. Stan
Brown led the way with two
homers and‘four RBI’s. Jim
Kaulius and Jim Richards also
had home runs.

Joel Tew went the first six
innings on the mound for the
Cats but was replaced by Tim
Barr who earned the victory in
relief.

The team finished its season
Monday night in Charleston
against the Citadel but was
unable to bring home a win.

The game, however, was
close as the Bulldogs needed a
three run rally in the sixth
inning to pull ahead for their
victory.

The Wildcats went ahead
1-0 in the third inning on Ed
Willingham’s solo homer. The
Citadel then came back to take
the lead 2-1 in the fourth.
Brown’s fifth home run of the
season in. the top of the sixth
knotted the count at 2-2.

Brown tripled and Willingham
singled to bring him home to
make the final score 3-5. Barr,
who pitched all nine innings,
took the loss.

Willingham, who has hit
nearly .500 for the past
twelve games, also had a
double in the Citadel game
that gave him a Davidson
single season record of eleven.

Coach Palmer’ Muench
named the Wildcat’s slow
start and the early season loss
of pitcher Barr as two main .
factors that hampered the
squad.

“After the first eight
games, we played close to .500
ball. But the real turning peint
was losing Tim Barr. We just
didn’t have the stoppers with
our pitchers. I am satisfied
with the progress we made
however.”’

Next year the Cats will have
a strong nucleus around which
they can build as the entire
infield returns along with
starting pitchers Barr, Ron
Cannon and Alan Alig. In
addition, Muench indicated
that recruiting “looked very
good”’ so far with the possibi-
lity that three all-staters will
be’coming in to fill positions.
