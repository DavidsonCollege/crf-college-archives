Helprin Balances Two Worlds In Winter’s Tale

By ANN MEADOR
Winter's Tale, by Mark Helprin. 680
pages. Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich.
$14.95.

Stories which involve flying white
horses and searches for the perfectly just
city tread a thin line between the adorable
and the repulsive. In Winter's Tale au-
thor Mark Helprin maintains a precarious
balance between the two, succeeding for
the most part because he makes no dis-
tinction between fantasyland and gritty
New York City. They are the same —
sure the horse flies, but he usually flies
only a city block at a time. By the end of
the novel we say, “Now, that was impos-
sible, but at least it took place in a real
city.”

Winter’s Tale is the epic-proportion
story of Peter Lake, an altogether mysti-
cal character who lives from the tum of
the 19th century to the beginning of the
third millenium. It is by following his life
that we follow the growth of New York
City; this book justifiably has been called
a biography of the city. Peter Lake takes
us everywhere — from the grime of the
Bowery to vault-like Fifth Avenue man-
sions, from the early 1900s to 1999 and
the dawn of what the characters hope will
be “the Golden Age.”

This search for a “Golden Age” per-
vades the novel; it is the sort of optimism
which is difficult to stomach and ulti-

mately dull to consider. But Winter's
Tale somehow transcends this preoccu-
pation with transcendence. Helprin’s
skill as a graceful storyteller makes this
gobbledegook palatable, so we end up
plugging away just because the story is
So entertaining.

Helprin’s characters are Dickensian
in name and action: Pearly Soames is the
most degenerate of gang leaders, and Be-
verly Penn is a ravishing, if consump-
tion-tortured, young woman. The rich
are very rich, and the poor live in the
basements of hovels.

The book's most moving sections
take place at the Lake of the Coheeries, a
tiny town up the Hudson which exists on
no map, we learn. Winters there are un-
believably cold, but the inhabitants never
worry about it. Like the block-jumping
horse, the cold of the Lake of the
Coheeries is a blend of the possible and
the impossible. Helprin describes it as
nonchalantly as he describes an office

building, yet the cold is inherently amaz-

ing. We must let this frustrating am-
biguity fall by the wayside, because it
can potentially obscure the strength of
the narrative.

Of the many bands to emerge from
Athens, Ga. in the past few years —
not that anyone is counting — Love
Tractor offers a new sound and a fresh
addition to “the Athens sound” (i.e.,
R.E.M., Pylon, and the B-52’s). As
their name suggests, the band cares lit-
tle for rock hype, and they are con-
cerned only with putting out good, lis-
tenable music. Their latest record,
Around the Bend, features guitar com-
positions which, with a close listen,
are truly entertaining.

The band has excellent technique.
On the first cut, “Highland
Sweetheart,” the band introduces a
ringing guitar theme — Love Tractor’s
trademark — and layers it with rhyme,
voice and basslines. You can’t slam
dance to it, but the first bars of any of
their songs usually get a crowd mov-
ing. Love Tractor’s music makes for a
must-see concert. They will play at F
