more interest were shown in the sport than this year, it should
be dropped from the intramural schedule. It appeared to be
a drudgery for some groups to field a team every afternoon,
The Athletic Department recognized the fact that interest
was at a low ebb when it refused to issue softball equipment
for practice before the volleyball season was completed. tt
used as its reason the statement. that if such equipment was
issued, the students would become so involved in softball
practice that they would not finish the volleyball tourna
ment. If this be the case, then why should they be made to
play the game. Intramurals are for the stuilent’s pleasure.

Could: itebe possible to push the track meet back a week
or-so, thus giving additional time-to-practice softball? -hr-this
way volleyball could be dropped. We realize that to push the
track meet back might interfere with the track season. but it
would give the fraternities a better chance to round inte
