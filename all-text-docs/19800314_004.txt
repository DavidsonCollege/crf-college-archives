Davidson’s progress passes
by the rusty old well

By A. T. MILLER
Staff Writer .

_ The old well doesn’t work
anymore. Four graceful arches
of ivied brick shelter the marble
font. In the center of the
fountain a short bit of threaded
pipe sticks up rudely. That’s
where the water used to come
out. The rusted foot pedal lies
flat and through with pumping
on the concrete floor. I used to
lie on that floor, too, and study
with my legs propped up on the
arches or the fountain. When
my eyes got tired I could look
up at the trees or watch the
shadow patterns of clouds on
the wide lawn or the changing
sunlight on_the brick-stone
buildings. Some bugs might
crawl on me or/a dog come by to
check things out or the wind
blow and make the stone cold.
People would stop, too, to talk
and have a drink.

Vereen Bell awards: memorial to imaginative graduate

By AIDA DOSS
~~ Features Editor
“Tf it. was in the Saturday

Evening Post you knew it had

to be good.”

So said English Professor Gil
Holland, speaking of the short
stories of Vereen Bell, a 1932
Davidson graduate. The name
may not be well-known now in
fashionable literary circles, but
in the mid-thirties and very
early forties, Bell was an up-
and-coming young writer, the
sort of talent that made editors

‘and perceptive readers keep
watch on him out of the corner
of their collective eye. He had
published between twenty and
thirty short stories and two
novels before he died when his
aircraft carrier was sunk in
World War II.

After Bell’s death, his family
and friends established the an-
nual Vereen Bell Memorial
Award for Creative Writing in
his memory. The award carries
a first prize of $50, and a second

of $25, for the best single piece « .
or collection of writing from an .

upperclass Davidson student.

A ‘separate prize, the R.
Windley’ Hall Award, will be
_ presented to the freshman who
has submitted the best piece or
collection of creative writing.
There will be a first prize of $40
and a second prize of $20. The
deadline for both contests is 5
_p.m., Monday, March 24, and
entries may be given to any

humiliation.”

Staycomb and part in the
middle with an axe.”

“Tell mouse about his won-
derful possibilities” Mouse will

Sweep up ashes in dust-pan.

After graduation, Bell at once
began to support himself by
writing short stories. The stor-

ies, almost ail of which dealt

with dogs, love, and hunting,
frequently appeared in the
pages of Colliers and The Satur-
day Evening Post. They were
likeable, popular, and as Hol-

land put it, “Once he'd (Beilj

started a story you couldn’t
stop reading it from the first
paragraph on. He was a master
of characterization and sus-
pense.”

Bell’s-first novel, Swamp
Water, published in 1941, was
set in the Okeefenokee Swamp
of southern Georgia (the road
leading into the swamp is now
known as the Vereen Bell

Highway). The novel received
favorable reviews, including the
following brief comment in the
New Yorker:

“A good, rousing yarn, effec-
tive not so much for its plot,
which involves a killer hiding in
a swamp and a boy who meets
him while looking for a lost
hound, but for the swamp itself.
It is the Okeefenokee Swamp in
Georgia, lively with alligators
and water moccasins, dark,
scary, easy to get lost in. The
boy, his old father, his young

stepmother, and his girl are

likeable folks, too. Even the
killer is a pleasant enough
fellow. A capable job. all
around.”’ (New Yorker, Feb-
ruary 22, 1941).

The movie version of Swamp
Water will be shown at David-
son this spring.

Bell’s second novel, Trial By
Marriage (published in another
edition as Two of a Kind), did
not receive the same critical
acclaim, but is notable anyway

for the blurb at the top of its
title page: ‘‘Duff understood
dogs—but not women.’’ ‘‘A
good old country story,” said
Holland.

Bell continued writing short
stories even after his induction
into the Army. His last pub-
lished story dealt with the
relationship between a pilot and
fighter jet in the Pacific Ocean.
Bell died when his escort air-
plane carrier went down in
Gambier Bay during the Second
Battle of the Phillipine Sea,
October 25, 1944.

Over the years, Davidson has
seen a number of distinguished
writers present the Vereen Bell
Award, including Robert Frost,
Archibald MacLeish, Donald
Hall, Robert Creeley, Robert
Bly, and James Dickey. This
year’s judge will be Maxine
Kumin, poet and novelist, who
won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973
for her book of poetry Up
Country.

People still stop and talk, on
the twoblock mainstreet with a
mile to the-farms. The well may
be through with pumping, but
everything else goes on. The
well is ignored by most now,
anyway. The past has just
gotten a little too old for a while
around here.

The Piedmont bank is bran-
ching into Charlotte while con-
dominiums grow by the lake.
The little girl in the ballerina
costume cuts the ribbon on
Sadler Square and the College
dreams of 1987. More and faster
are beginning to sound pretty
good. Even the Village Store
bought itself a Copeland House
not long ago, and the Peregrine
nested with a chain. The Knox’s
keep on building and it’s got to
be a New South, even in
Davidson.

We can’t be too sentimental,
now; change is inevitable. That
may be so. A lot of people tell
me so. I’m just not so sure that
growth and change are synony-
mous. Maybe we could stop the
new for a while and change the
old a little. We could fix the old
well for starters.

The intersection of Concord
and Main at the center of town
tells all. From the north come
the CB radioed glasspack pick-
ups and beertoting wilddrive
cars of the mill and factory
workers, pausing, just legal, at
the swaying stoplight. From
the south come the dusty-tired
old lady sedans of the sixties
and the harried-mother young
family stationwagons. These
stop and wait patiently -nd
sometimes a bit too long at the
dirty stoplight before resuming,
their steady pace. From the east
come vehicles of efficiency and

_ elegance, impatient with having

to come through town. They
pause in bored deference to that
law, then with graceful turns
they quickly and quietly leave
the scene. There is no road from
the west. The curtain of stores
hides the railroad tracks and the
blacks don’t ride through town.
