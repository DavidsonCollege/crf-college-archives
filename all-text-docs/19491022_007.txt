PIKAS 24—PI KAPPA PHI 0

Jack Fanjoy put on a one man
show in the Pika’s victory over the
Pi Kapps as he caught S$ passes and
scored 3 touchdowns. L. A. Park.
accounted for the other score on
a pass play. Lenton did all passing
for. Pika. Billy Houck provided the
Pi Kappa Phi's offense, It wa-
‘strictly an offensive game with
Pika having the edge in first downs
by 5 - 4. Ie was Pika's third vic.
tory against one loss. Pi Kappa
Phi has yet to win.

SAE 12—CAMPUS CLUB 0

The SAE's continued their win
ning streak by downing four times
beaten Campus Club. The Campu-
Club has yet to win and yet to
score a single touchdown. Running
from a trick T-.formation, the
SAE’s scored twice early in the
game and coasted the rest of the
way. It was Ken Goodpasture who
accounted for one of the touch
downs and another pass play ac-
counted for the other, First down.
were in favor of SAE’s.

K. A. 14—PHI-GAMS 6

Monday afternoon the undefeat-
ed K. A.’s were pressed to the
limit by a spirited Phi Gam crew.
It was not until the second half
that either team reached pay “dirt.
The K.A.'s scored. first on a “dou.
ble sleeper” play that was beauti-
fully executed. Bill Bird faked an
aerial to Charlie Mitchell on the
right side line and fired a long
pass to the galloping Tucker on the
left who raced the remaining eigh-
teen yards for the initiad marker.
The Phi Gams gave the K.A.'s
a taste of their own medicine and
pulled a nice sleeper play. them-
selves, This was a Clark.to-Crawley
aeriel that put the Phi Gams back
in the game. With the score tied
and fifty seconds to go, the Phi
Gams had the ball on the K.A.
five but failed to store on two
passes and a run. The game went
into an extra half that was K.A.
all the way. “Glenn Davis" Bird
hit “Stump” Asbury for the marker,
and, due to the booming kick-offs
of Hal Haynes, the Phi Gams were
their goal by a
charging K. A. line. The game was
K.A. all the way from this point on.

BETAS 18—KAPPA SIG 0

Also on Monday afternoon the
very strong, undefeated Beta team
crushed the previously undefeated
Kappa Sigs, 18-0. The sights of
Earl Smith remained in perfect
line this week as he repeated last
week’s feat and hurled all three
passes that hit for Beta talleys.The
first aeriel was latched on to by
Hankins, and the second by Joy-
Chuck Elliot made ai circus

catch of the last pass to end the
scoring for the day. It was a spec-
tacular catch. The Betas also show-
ed a nice running offense from
scrimmage, The game was rough,
both .sides running and blocking
hard, but the Kappa Sigs were un-
able to stop the power of the Beta
machine.

PI KAPPA'S 12—SIGMA CHI 6

The Pi Kaps and Sigma Chis
started the Tuesday afternoon foot-
ball slate with an exciting game.
The Sigma Chis led the Pi Kaps
up till the Jase five minutes of

‘play when a Houck to Carr “sleep.

er” play pulled the game out of
the fire for the Pi Kaps. “Choo
Choo” Houck kept the Sigma Chis
at bay all day with his accurate
aeriels, rousing running, powerful
punts, and pass interceptions, The
Sigma Chis looked very good on of-
fense also, but they could not ac-
crue enough points to defeat the
Pi Kaps in the last three minutes.
The pass combination of Kelton
to Sellers clicked for the only Blue
marker. Kelton also looked good
on several offensive running plays.
The game was a thriller for the Pi
Kaps, and a heart-breaker for th

Sigma Chis, . ‘

Towel Totin’, Bucket Swinging

{Foursome Keeps Footballers Going

By DAN McKEITHEN

Although life for the football

‘player is never too rosy, there are
,

a certain group of unpublicized in-
dividuals who attempt to make
football as pleasant as possible for
the players. The group to whith
the ‘reference is made are the man-
agers of the team, While the job
of making things run smoothly on
the field is left to the team, the job
of making things run smoothly off
he field is left to the managers.
‘The managers of our own Red
nd Black machine are Senior Man-
agers Rucker Dudley and Bill
loublose, and Junior Managers Phil
Mitchell and Dave “Shorty” La-
Far, Although it might be noticed
that all of these men are members
of the Kappa Sigma social frater-
nity. it is general knowledge that
a man from another frat might be
able, with a little pull, to go out
for a managerial post. However
when one knows of the many duties
which managers must perform he
usually leavts such a job, to the
Sigimas.
‘Phil does quite a bit more than
run out on the playing field with
a bucket of water and Rucker does
not spend all of his afterrioons
watching practice with a towel
around his neck. It adds up to a
little work when one has to be a
private valet to each hulking mons.
ter on-the squad, Not only is he a
general errand boy, but he might
also be labeled as equipment. care-
taker. Shorty and Bill have spent
more enjoyable moments than
those that were spent cleaning
three inches of mud from the cleats
used in thé State game. Once in a

—

while the players turn up with
dirty equipment; the managers
must remedy this. As a sideline
these boys get to take out knee-
pads for cleaning of the pants and
then are allowed to replace these
pads before games.

Around game time the managers
deal in such merchandise as
Oranges, ice and chewing gum.
There are also numerous other little
duties that go along with a college
football game. The managers often
wonder how the players can bring
in so much of the playing field
with them. It’s a never-ending
proposition, that managing and
everything else that goes along with
it,

Here's a hand to the hardwork-
ing managers, a vital cog in the
