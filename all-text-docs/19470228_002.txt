Letters To The
Editors...

Dear Editor :-

With the appearance this week of the
revised second issue otf the SCRIPTS 'N
PRANKS, there will be some people who
will regard it with keen interest as. to
whether it would be wise to continue the
publication or not. Of course there will also
be those who have already formed their
ideas concerning the Fate that should be
allotted to the publication — a one way trip
across the River Stynx..

In writing this letter I am aware that
the arguments which I set forth do not just
apply to the magazine alone but to all of
the publications here on the campus. All
that I ask of the reader is that he keep his
mind clear of all prejudices and open to all
that which I say. For those that refuse to
leave their little “Ivory Towers.” all that I
can possibly say is that I extend to you my
deepest sympathy,

Please take note that within this let-
ter I express my own reasons for the
continuance of the college magazine,
SCRIPTS 'N PRANKS, which are purely
unselfish. ones, and are in the interest
soley for the betterment and improvement
of Davidson College. They are six, and as
follows:

First, the college magazine is of a
general nature, including both serious and
humorous material. In this Way, it opens
its doors to all students who are able to
write and affords them the opportunity of
writing for a publication material which
would not be suitable: for a newspaper
such as the Davidsonian.

Second, the SCRIPTS 'N PRANKS
is sent to a hundred or more colleges and
universities all over the United States thus
furnishing the college with invaluable ad-
vertisements which it would not. obtain
otherwise.

Third, this publication serves as a
proving ground as does the Davidsonian
for writers who wish to be accepted into
such literary groups on the campus as the
Enmenean and — Philanthropic Literary
“ocieties and finally the opportunity of
Securing a seat in Sigma Upsilon.

: Fourth, by having one’s work accepted
and printed by this magazine a certain a-
mount of pride in his work, incentive for
greater achievements, and self assurance
is installed within the very man.

Fifth, This Fhesitate in putting forth,
byt to those for whom T am writing this I
fee! certain that they will clearly see my
n~vnt, This is that a boy between 19 and
25 vears of age has a great amount of
stpred up exuberance which must be spent
before taking his place in this world asa
e*#'7en and father of the next generation.
This exuberance will quite often be on the
horderline and may at times step over
t'-+ tndefined fence between the conven-
tional and the unconventional. ‘

«~ Sixth, the experience to be had by
working on a staff such as this one will

prove to be invaluable to anyone who plans
to enter into either the writing or printing
field or even if the student looks forward
to being a salesman, For those who fall into
this last group we recommend the business
staff, because in one’s seeking ads, he

comes into contact with outside people and |
makes the acquaintance of business men.
whose friendship would prove to be of |
great value to him if perchance he decides’
on making his living in this vicinity. In
this way also he learns how to conduct him-
self and make use of diplomacy which any
Susiness requires and which is not ‘possible
to be learned in a classroom,

The above six reasons seem sufficient
to me for the continuance of the magazine
or any other publication on this campus.
To discontinue such an organization would
Se totlower the standards of any institution
Secause upon graduation the men would
have little or no knowledge of the out-
side world and having to start from scratch
would mean a long and arduous climb up
the ladder of success.

We: feel confident that you and your
readers will heartily concur with us in our
desire to continue publication. However,
if there be any constructive criticism of
the SCRIPTS °"N PRANKS, that you
know of, please do not -hestitate to drop
‘1s acard or let any member of the staff
know because this magazine is for you, the
students and faculty of Davidson College.
Yours sincerely,

Doug Sink. .

Mr. Dave Richardson
\ssistant [Editor
Dear Sir+-
As regards your editorial in THI
DAVIDSONIAN of February 14, 1947
! would like to express a few of my views.
l‘irst I must say that this is my first year
here, and some of what T want to say is
based on what others tell me.
The. Davidson basketball tean: made
the tournament in 1943 when the en-
rollment was only 699, not quite your pro-
posed 1,000. If we were to want to increase
to this number for the sake of getting a
good team, it still wouldn't be comparable to
a number ofthe other teams in the South-
ern Conference. The school has gotten
good teams before with a-small student
hody and [| see no reason why we can’t do
iL again,
To increase the student body to such
anumber causes us to realize that the dor-
mitory space is sadly insufficient. Here |
might take space to say thanks to Mr.
Dudley Camper, who, alongside of your
editorial, pointed out one of the great
drawbacks of the increased enrollment.” |
think that there are very few of the ones
who are really interested in learning some-
thing up here that won't agree that it is
very hard to do the studying required
here ina room with two others. Supposing
some of the 1,000 here now are not here
fot all the education offered them, this
makes a good reason for all the noise that
is complained about in*most 6f the dormi-
tories. nt
This is without a doubt part of the
reason, and it should put the problem. be-
fore the “powers that be” as to whether it
is worthwhile to graduate 250 to a class or
to educate 125 to a class.
Your little saying about “send your
hoy to Davidson and we'll send your boy
hack” doesn’t seem to-have the circulation
that the good name of the education vou
reecive here has. | come-from Texas and
never heard any such rumors about bovs
own there, but certainly did hear only
‘rood about scholastics, :
I think that if you would stop, and
consider you would have to agree that our
“Solomon” has been streatched to its limit
in the library facilities. Have you never
walked into the library at night when you
had a hard time finding a place to sit
down? Have you never waited days to
get a.chance at a parallel hook which the
ofher 100 or_more taking the course
keep continually busy ?-Or perhaps I should
ask have you been in the library this vear ?
There are more arguments which 1
could take up, but won’t now as to avoid
heing verhoselv horing. ”

Sincerely,

Breezin’

BY BOB RIERSON

Last week an editorial appeared
in the Davidsonian that announced
the resignation of the Editor-in-
Chief of this sheet, Edward C. Sut-
ton, The reasons for and cireum-
stances of his resignation are there
in print for all.to, see so that it
would be only waste space for me to
repeat what has already been
printed. But there is no reason why
T should not pay my tribute to Ed,
to try in some insufficient measure
to pay back the great favor that he
gave me, or at least to acknowledge
it. Also I should like to put across
the fact that Ed is a swell guy and
a good editor in case there are some
who are not aware of the fact.

Ed has bucked uphill all year try-
ing to keep the Davidsonian going
with little or no help at times. He
has very often been deserted by all
but a faithful few, among which
group I cannot include myself, no
excuses offered. He deserved a
better fate, and- perhaps he would
still be editor if’the production of
the paper could have gone more
easily. But having to publish a
paper almost single-handedly takes
plenty of time away from studies,
and, as he said, his medical aim had
to come first. But he still put out
a good paper despite all the difficul-
ties. He is to be commended by the
student body, one and all, for a
job well done.

As for the chance he gave me, it

appears to me to be evident with

every letter typed. I hope my al-
leged readers will forgive me for
this personal reference, but it has
an end in view which, I hope, will
be clear. Yours truly was only a
slugging reporter on this sheet (and
perhaps should have stayed so!)
when Jim Jackson had to resign be-
cause of the press of his studies.
Sut offered me the job which would
provide very good experience, ex=
perience that & probably would
never have gotten but for that.
This being my last year at good old
D. C. (I plan to transfer to more
specialized surroundings next sum-
mer), I could not have gone up the
ordinary paths to editorship. Know-
ing this and aware of the fact that
I was not even a junior, Ed gave
me the job, nevertheless, and I can
never thank him enough. The only
way to learn to write is to wear
out the seat of one’s britches in
front of a typewriter, so I got my
chance. I’m sorroy that the swell
gang of fellows here at Davidson
had to be the guinea pigs, but some-
body had to suffer. Besides it’s
easy enough to lay the paper down.

But now to avoid getting sticky
and tiresome, I'll just sign off for
this time, I hope you get the point,
Ed, because what has been said here
is sincere, even though badly put.
So long and good luck to ya, Trout-
head, a great big welcome and the
same kind of luck to you, Jim. See
you in the columns!

The Operating Table

To the parents and kin of the David-

Who venture on deals of spectacu-
lar sin,

The table is able to broadcast this

fable,

That a word to the wise and a wink
to the stable,

Is sufficient to curb and otherwise
mar,

The weekend trips both near and

afar,

Of the dealers’ described who have
made themselves known,

By actions_alike to those of “The
Bone.”

This hill country club-has oft had
its members,

Halved into groups of dealers and
limbers,

And in this very column the groups

will be bared,

It seems that Don Watt of aerial

With wolfish gleam in his practiced
eye,

He whispered sweet nothings and
patted her back,

When suddenly deep from the floor
she swung,

On the dismayed Watt profile a
shiner was hung.

Among the more daring of the seek-
ers of glory,

Of keeping their names from the

Down Fraternity Court

KAPPA SIGMA

After an unmistakle week end of
revelry, it is uncovered that one
Martin Waters shared the acquaint-
ance of Mr. John Law. whose resi-
dence is some fifty feet down a
side road approximately a mile
from the Charlotte city limits.
Waters, a speedly operating Casa-
nova from way back (about seventy
miles-—an hour) was taking a de-
vious route to Gaffney when John
perchanced to bring his telescope
upon him. The aftermath, we are
not exactly sure, but rumor holds
it that with recent accumulated
funds, Charlotte will have a new
paved highway.

Gregg Thompson reports an un-
eventful—movie~at~ Winston-Salem
while Bitter Bingham, returning
from the Briar Hoppers’ Saturday
nite hoe-down, laments of being
flushed by the miner’s daughter
(shaft No. 27) in West Virginia.
Save for Torch Turnbull, who won’t
let on why he keeps whistling “Love
on a Greyhound bus,” other Sigmas
were seen at the ball game in Ra-
leigh or taking in the midnite triple
“A” Dominoe production at the
local cinema.

S. A. E. FRATERNITY

“Shaming the Betas in basketball
and snow-slinging was about the
height of activity this past week,
The general trend over the week
end was the pursuit of stable pleas-
ures as enjoyed by pledge brother
Sid Bruce, who takes exceeding joy
in thumbing to South Carolina with
a wardrobe consisting largely of
articles that could best be described
as “something borrowed”—period!
It’s tears in the beer for brother
John Coddington, now wearing ex-
tra fraternity hardware which still
retains traces of the last dear
touches of “Pudden” McKoy.
The magnetic powers of Gieens-
boro drew brother Ford Little, and
never-say-die pledges’ Hideous
Hemby, “Junior” McAllister, and
Bill and Bob Little en masse to
W. C. for what has been officially
termed a quiet time.. Jim Harris
took in hometown Wilmington, pre-
ferring the simple, uneventful life
to such rare moments as Midwin-
ters, while Dick Port dropped in
on the folks in Winston-Salem to
run over a few bars of “Memphis
in June.”

PHI GAMMA DELTA

Like Ivory Soap, the entire chap-
ter was 99.97 per cent pure last
week end. Brothers Maloney and
Ilyea rejoiced over the success of
Y. M. C. A. deputations of recent
months. After a quiet pig dinner
in Charlotte Saturday night, Broth-
rs Patrick, Bealls, Vance, Aldred,
Brown, Fairly, Hudnell, and Ragan
returned. to the campus to spend
Sunday in attending vesper serv-
ices. Brother Richardson journey-
ed sedately to Rock Hill to visit
his father, Rey. Donald W. Rich-
ardson, D. D. “Spotless Frank”

Strait, “Sober James” Poag, “Vice-
less Ed” Newton, “Holy Dick”
Blanks, and a Paul” Jenkins
visited Winthrop College, but re-
frained from participating in the
midwinters dance for fear of the
possibility of being led into im-
morality. Leaving the dance at
11:45, they indicated the disap-
proval with which they looked on
such degeneration of the younger
set.

And now may the grace of true
brotherhood rest and abide with
you all. Amen.

PHI DELTA THETA

In one of the largest weeks of
dealing on record, men of N. C.
Gamma covered the Carolinas and
Georgia in goodly numbers. Par-
ticipating in Operations Converse
were Brothers Witherspoon, Hoop-
er, McGehee, Guthrie, Wilkins, J.,
Wilkins, W., and Palmer. Brothers
Newell, Starnes, and Oglesby were
off to Atlanta’s famed Peachtree
St. Brother Starnes mumbles of
Bees and Butterflies. Chapel Hill
was__the._destination.ef Brother
Johnson although authoritative re-
ports say the 200 pounds of bone
and muscle was detained ‘en route.
Brother Willingham was seen on
the Duke campus some seven milés
off his course in former days. Bro-
ther McLean visited Lenoir and
courted Winthrop style, while
Brothers’ Tate and Golden were
holding down Morganton. Brother
Knight painted Tarboro aflame and
Brothers Long, McGeachy, and Col-
son report that all is well in the
Queen City. As usual Brothers
Bernhardt and Cameron were grac-
ing the campus of W. C. up Greens-
boro way.

PI KAPPA PHI

With dances over for another
month, the Pi Kapps sat back and
relaxed. Of course the “Dealers”
took off as usual for their various
haunts. Brother Evans to Chapel
Hill, Brother Robertson to Duke
to see Billy Rose. Aren’t you sorry
about Friday now Bill? Brothers
Higgcenbotham and Thad Barringer
went to Winthrop Saturday to see
their flames. Thad didn’t have
enough so he took off for Char-
lotte Sunday night. Brothers Lan-
der, Delaney, Rush, Sinclair, Bum-

‘barger, Houck, Harden, Campbell

and Everett “dealed” in the Queens
area as usual. Brothers Cline and
Edwards made a last minute trip
to Hickory. Why, we don’t know!
Brothers Jéhnson, Dobson, Cox and
Sasser again brought some more
“horrible” stories back. Best bet
of the week, ... Go to Mooresville
with Brother Cline and see the
“Show.” Happiest man of the.
week—Brother Reid “Tootie”
came to Davidson the week
end.

Cinema Comments

By Doug Swink

MONDAY AND TUESDAY
MARCH 3-4

“THE STRANGE WOMAN”

This is a story of the life and
leve affairs of a violent, ambitious
and vain woman called Jenny. The
scene is in the 1840 puritanical
town of Bangor, Maine. Beautiful
Hedy Lamarr as Jenny is the cal-
lous, _self-seeking female “who
meets her just deserts in the end.”
Miss Lamarr is supported by
George Sanders, Louis Hayward,
and Gene Lockhart. As the West-
ern Committee of the Daughters of
the American’ Revolution _ said,
“Ethical and social values are en-
tirely lacking.” Thus “The Strange
Woman” comes in the middle of
review week.

WEDNESDAY
MARCH 5
“GENIUS AT WORK”

When a radio program~-of un-
solved murders dramatizes one
story--which-eomes-so-close to the
‘ruth that The Cobra, the sadistic
perpetrator of several crimes, final-
‘y betrays himself and is eventually
apprehended. The cast includes
Lionel Atwill, Anne Jeffreys, and
Wally Brown.

THURSDAY AND FRIDAY

MARCH 6-7
“BACHELOR'S DAUGHTERS”

A comedy of manners concerning

four young department store girls,
Gail Russell, Claire Trevor, Ann
Dvorak, and Jane Wyatt, who, seek-
ing love, fame and fortune, pool
their assets and buy a large sub-
urban estate to provide a wealthy
background for meeting the right
kind of people. They adopt Adolph
Menjou and Billie Burke as -their
parents. Eugene List plays. the
part of a pianist. This is one of
the few musician roles which have
been well woven into the plot, be-
cause when he plays there is a
natural and understanding reason
for his doing so, and the action
does not come to a complete stop
in order for him to display his tal-
ents. His playing, however, is thé

highlight of the picture.

SATURDAY

MARCH 8

“SHADOW OF A WOMAN”

Having searched through all of
the files that are available to me.
there could not be any information
gained from them except the fact
that the following two stars head
the cast, Andrea King and Helmut
Dantine. Judging only from the
name, we have come to the con-
clusion that there must be a mur-
der somewhere in the plot and the
solving 6f that murder must be
centered around finding the woman

to whom the shadow belongs.
