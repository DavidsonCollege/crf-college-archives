Spring break brings
adventure and service

By CoLin EAGAN

Ah, spring at Davidson. For many, the
change of season represents midterms, pretty
flowers, and, of course,spring break. Though
the weeklong vacation is typically viewed as
an opportunity for relaxation, many students

‘this’spring sprung not for:suntans, but’séf-~

vice.

Need a Break Alternative?

“Tt was a totally new experience,” reflected
KK Baird’04 on her recent, not-so-common
spring break activities. Baird was one of over
52 students who participated in the Alterna-
tive Breaks program at Davidson. The pro-
gram, which hosts service-themed trips in the
fall and spring, sent students to five locations
this spring break, including Detroit and New
Orleans. Program Head Taylor Herbert’01
suggests that the purpose of an Alternative
spring break lies far from kicking back and
relaxing. “The ultimate goal of these trips is
touse the trip experience as a catalyst in order
to direct participants into lives of social ac-
tion and service,” he explained. “The core
components of a good break are exposure to

Anyone who’s ever faced the prospect of

often the Achilles” heel of student organiza-

usually needed. At Davidson,.the Activities -
Tax Council (ATC) has control over student
organization funding — or at Jeast, it should.

a challenging and novel situation to the par-
ticipant, direct service at the site, strong inter-
actions with members of the community, and
thoughtful reflection about the situations en-
countered and one’s role in it.”

Baird and ten others traveled with Alterna-

tive Breaks to Detroit, where they worked

with the Save Our Sons and Daughters pro-
gram, begun by mothers who have lost their
children as a result of gun violence in the city.
Here, Davidson student vacationers learned
tactics and strategies for combating urban
violence in schools, and worked at length
one-on-one with local students, discussing
peace and how to achieve it. “It. was a great
experience,” reflected Baird, “gettiag to see
what goes on in an inner-city school, and also
being able to talk to the students and hear
them share their feelings about violence. It’s
really hard to describe in words—it was just
an amazing experience, and I would recom-
mend Alternative Breaks to anyone who is
considering going on one.”

Beach-Verhey puts faithto __
work as Lilly program director

By RICHARD VINSON
Editor in chief

Davidson College recently named Visiting

. Professor of Religion Timothy Beach-Verhey

the director of its new Program for the
Theological Exploration of Vocation.

This fledgling office is the culmination of
the Lilly
Endowment’ s four-

grantto the college.
As program direc-
tor, Beach-Verhey |
will administer a
broad array of new
initiatives designed
to help students,
faculty, alumni, and
the larger Davidson
community explore
the relationship be-
tween faith and
work.

A self-described
student of practical
ethics, _ Beach-
Verhey expressed
the belief that the

an acute need in

wana ithe pore recently appointe d the

y: P adminstrator of the Lilly Grant
gram] grows out of
the recognition that

people today, with the dominance of the
marketplace, have lost their ability to talk
about their lives with a deeper sense of mean-
ing,” he remarked.

People may communicate and think about
that sense of deep significance through reli-
gious or other core beliefs, but, as Beach-
Verhey confessed, “I have a strong sense that
everyone is searching for connection and
meaning.”

on Senate’s Special Projects fund

Recent problems have stripped the ATC of
some of its authority and made the SGA a
faster, easier source of funds. In order to
correct these problems, anew committee will
be formed to study the relationship between
these two organizations.

The SGA has traditionally been more than
happy to dip into its Special Project Fund to
help out new or struggling organizations. This
well-intentioned practice, according to SGA
President Joey Harris, has had some unin-
tended consequences. Many organizations
have fallen into the practice of applying di-
rectly to SGA for-funds, bypassing ATC
altogether. However, the funding guidelines
specifically state that groups should not ap-
proach the SGA for funds unless recom-
mended by the ATC.

Randy Skattum, the ATC chair, believes
this practice arose out of confusion over ATC
procedures. ATC conducts two main alloca-
tions, Spring (for the fiscal year) and Fall (for
“new ideas, new investments”), at which
student organizations present budget propos-

als. The ATC then makes recommendations
to the SGA, which has the final say. Many
students are under the misconception that the
ATC’ role is limited to these two meetings.
(The ATC also meets on demand throughout
the year.)

Unaware students took to applying directly
to SGA for money from the Special Projects
fund. In doing so, many organizations dis-
covered that SGA was a far easier source of
money. SGA doesn’t demand a written pro-
posal and budget; ATC does. Furthermore,

. SGA deliberations are conducted in the pres-

ence of applicants, whereas the ATC deliber-
ates privately. iePes

Skattum likened this to an “Ask Mom, Ask
Dad” situation, where one parent (the SGA)
is more likely to say yes. “Why go to the
ATC,” he asked, if an organization can avoid
scrutiny and paperwork by simply applying
to SGA? Harris also pointed out that the
ATC is more rigorous in analyzing student

see ATC. page 4

The new program, then, will focus on re-
storing some of the vocabulary that describes
and enables that search. More specifically, it
will encourage students and others “‘to talk
and to think self-critically” about how. that
search applies practically to one’s vocation.

Professor of Religion John Kuykendall re-
called that some of these concerns. were fore-
most in the minds
of the committee
that drafted the
grant proposal.
Kuykendall acted
as “convener,” of
the committee or-
ganized by Presi-
dent Bobby Vagtto
explore the possi-
bility of securing
one of the Lilly
grants.

They began
working last year
and met on a
weekly basis for
most of the second

semester to prepare
the proposal. The
program that
emerged from their
work emphasized
exploration of vo-
cation on three lev-
els. “I think of it as
three concentric
circles,” noted Kuykendall.

First, the program is intended to “discover
able and committed Christian people who are
willing to consider the ordained ministry,”
Kuykendall explained.

This emphasis corresponds to one of the
stated goals of the Lilly Endowment, to en-
