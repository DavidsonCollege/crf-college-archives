Article IV, Section 7 of the

Draft Laws: Thorn
In A Senior’s Side

By JIM COOLEY
Staff Writer
(First of two articies)

Many Davidson seniors are
wondering where they will be
and what they will be doing
next fall. The problem is not
a sudden epidemic of inde
cision but the . uncertainty
which a new draft law and a
recent memorandum by the
National Security Council
have caused among college
students across the nation.

Senate bill $1432, passed by
Congress last June, was not
remarkably different from
the law which it replaced,
but there are several points
that are of particular con
cern to draft registrants.

The most important reform
was a provision which enables
the President to alter the
present ‘‘oldest first’’ policy
of drafting used by the na-
tion’s 4100 local draft boards.

Aside from volunteers and
those delinquent with,the Se
lective. Service, the .lacal
boards pick draftees who are
single or married after Aug.
26, 1965, and who are be-
tween the ages of 19 and 26.

Executive order presently
decrees drafting of the oldest
within thig category first.

Thus, all the 25-year-olds are
drafted before anyone age 24
is called, and all the ‘25-year
olds born in January are tak-
en before any of those born
in February.

Under the new law Presi
dent Johnson could reverse
the policy to the youngest
first. If such were to hap-
pen, the graduating student
would be placed in the high.
est priority group (19-year-
olds) for one year. If he were
not drafted within this pe-
riod, he would drop back into
his regular age group and his
probability of being drafted
would be greatly decreased.

The new law stipulates that
the President may not end
undergraduate deferments
unless the armed forces
manpower needs so dictate.

The most controversial sec-
tion of the draft law concerns
draft violators and those pro-
testing against the draft. In
a:memegrandum dated Oct.
26, Lt. General Lewis, B.-Her’
shey, director of the Selective
Service, instructed local
boards to draft immediately
anyone who interfered with
military recruiting on cam-
pus; who burned, tore up or

refused to carry his draft
card; or who attempts to dis-
rupt the drafting process in
Selective Service offices.

which you can adequately
