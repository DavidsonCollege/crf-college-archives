Men’s tennis has
outstanding fall

By WHIT WILKS

The ‘Wildeats have concluded
their fall schedule, and Coach Jeff
Frank is pleased with the results.

Having lost numbers 1, 2, 4, 7,
and 8 from last season’s squad,
Davidson was facing what ap-
peared to be a rebuilding year.
After dominating their two dual
matches and performing well in
two tournaments, “reloading”
appears to better describe the
young 1988-89 team.

Davidson defeated Catawba 7-
2, with both losses coming at the
bottom of the doubles ladder, and
destroyed UNCC 14-1. In the
UNCC contest, 10 singles and 5
doubles matches were played as
the Cats turned in an exceptional
team performance.

The Washington & Lee Invita-
tional included Ohio University,
James Madison, Davidson, and
the host school.

Sebastian Koch won the top
singles flight, losing no more than
three games any set. Addition-
ally, Koch (voted the tourna-
ment’s outstanding player) and

freshman Dale Voeks got to the
finals of the top doubles flight
before falling.

Tim Hagood got to the finals of
the third flight doubles, while
Kurtis Zabell and freshman John
Beyer won the second flight
doubles.

In the Don Skakle Invitational, ‘

the field included UNC, Wake
Forest, Duke, N.C. State,
Richmond, Presbyterian, and
Davidson.

Blake O’ Brien and Hagood de-
feated teams from Wake and
Duke on their way to reaching the
finals in flight #2 doubles.
O’Brien, Hagood, Voeks, David
Jaspersen, and Mike Von

_Bodangen all won two of three
“singles rounds.

Frank has been very pleased
with the fall campaign. The up-
perclassmen have provided lead-
ership for freshmen, who in turn
have handled collegiate tennis
very well to this point.

Frank can only hope that the
solid play carries over into the
spring season.

What are calories and

how do you burn them? [ty

INFORMATION ON
CALORIES
(cited from The Weekend Ath-
lete’s Fitness Guide by Peter

Verney):

1. Your body uses about 1600
Calories a day for normal func-
tions such as breathing, sleeping,
and digestion.

2. You require additional Calo-
ries for day-to-day activity, i.e.
occupation, recreation, exercise.

3. Your daily calorific intake
usually exceeds your body’s re-
quirements, even after counting

Walking Stairs-200

Rowing (Sustained)-660-800

Brisk Walking-435

Rowing (Sculling/Race)-840

Basketball-600 -

Running-900

Biking (Recreational)-250

Swimming (Recreational)-300

Biking (9 m.p.h.)-415

calories burned in exercise. If you—Fitness Tip of the Week:

take in more calories than you
burn, you will gain weight.

4. Every extra 3,000 Calories
equals an approximate increase of
one pound in weight. In other
words, if you reduce your intake
by 430 Calories a day, you will
lose one pound after a week.
Remember, though, if you are
trying to lose weight, lose it
gradually. It took a long time to
put on the weight; it will take
awhile to lose it again.

Rowing (Easy)-300

Many people think that if you
quit exercising, your muscles will
turn to fat. In a recent Charlotte
Observer article by Gerri Kobren,
entitled “Exercise Has Its Own
Mythology,” Dr. Robert Zeigler
dispels this myth with fact:
“Muscles and fat are two different
kinds of tissue, and one does not
turn into the other.”

According to Zeigler, muscles
shrink when you stop exercising.
When you stop exercising, you
burn less Calories, causing fat
cells toexpand. “You may look as
if muscles have ~ been trans-
formed, even though that’s not
what happens,” he adds.
