HOMESICK
One thing college men always believe is
that it takes a heap of lovin’ to make one
feel at home.

SHAKE, RATTLE AND ROLL
When Elsie and I were playmates
Closely by her porch we stayed.
I mixed the mud for wondrous pies,
That flat on aboard were laid,

Domest’cally, she rolled ’em.

When Elsie and I were playmates
She had the men simply wild.

A MERRY DRAMA:

In Many Acts and Numberless
Scenes

Introducing “The Freshman,” or to speak
campus wise “Fresh,” a verdant member of
|'26, who constantly craves information. It
is our resolution that he shall be informed.

Characters: “Mack” Lennox, a rather
| Prominent senior; he prides himself on the
inobbiness of his wardrobe; it is his private

opinion that he is a veritable lady-killer.

“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and no less
|prominent junior; in matter of dress, his
taste is more conservative and substantial;
in regard to his fove affairs the old adage,
“Still water runs ca is applicable. *

THE HIDDEN JOKE
Act the Eighth

HOW IRRITATING

Here’s to the chigger,

he bug that’s no bigger
Then the point of a good sized pin.
But the point that he raises
Itches like blazes,
And that’s where the rub comes in.
Mac—Boys open up your ears and listen
these pregnant lines—
Bill—Not so bad, eh, what, as Psmith

to

| would say.

Mac—Behold, you are gaining in wisdom
and apreciation.

Bill—But speaking of irritating things, I
wish that you’d buy yourself a pair o’ shoes.

| Your continual use of mine is irritating.

Mac—I would if I knew what to buy.

Bill—Buy yourself a pair o’ Clapps. Get
a pair with toes a bit square and not too
many fancy findangles; they’re wearing
them plainer this year. Wouldn't risk any
soft toes, they might last the season
through and thenthey might not. The dope
is that blacks and tans are about equal in
favor.

Mac—All true but suppose I can’t afford a

| Clapp?

Bill—A Clapp will be much cheaper in the
} long run and no mistake, but if the first
|cost is all important. you might try a
Thompson, they’re good shoes without a
doubt and yet their cost is not excessive.

Mac—and, might I ask, who sells Clapps

|
.Bill—Mellon’s of course, and likewise

| they handle the Thompson.

Adv. (To be continued next week)

Her daring cyes made rival dames
Seem so, pallid, tame and mild.

How she rolled’ em! —

When Elsie and I were sweethearts,
She had a naughty habit.

As I brought forth my Durham sack
Of reaching o'er to grab it.

And she roled ’em!
Professionally, she rolled ’em!

Now Elsie and I are married.

I buy her silk hose by the box.
She ignores my protestations quite,

And most down to the very clocks
Still she rolls ‘em!

Entrancingly, she rolls ‘em.

One of the two things a young girl thinks |

about is the man she might go with next.

There is a college man who never does
Nor smokes nor chews, nor swears;
Who never gambles, never flirts,
And shuns all sinful snares—

He’s Paralzycd.

There is a college man who never does
A thing that is not right;
His gir! can tell just where he is
At morning, noon and night—

‘GIBBS AND PATTERSON

SPEAK IN MOCKSVILLE

A deputation from the Volunteer Band
was sent to Mocksville on Sunday, March
18th. The men who made this trip were
L. B. Gibbs and. P. M. Patterson. The gath-
ering to which these two spoke was the
Christian Endeavor meeting Sunday even-
ing.

Gibbs spoke on the ‘general need of Mis-
sions and of workers, the progress that
has been made since the beginning, and why

|it is the duty of everyone who feels the call
/to go.

The great field of China was Patterson's
topic, with which he is so familiar, having
been born there and living there until a few
years ago. He impressed the conditions now
prevailing there and showed what China
| would be wrhout the Gosnel. He spoke
also of China’s recources, many of which
are yet untouched.
