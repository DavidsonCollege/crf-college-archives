ON THE
SPORTS FRONT

With the decision this sum-
mer to hold selected home soccer
games on Richardson field, and
the subsequent paring down to
three lanesof the A. Heath Whittle
Track to make room for the nec-
essary extra grass, the Davidson
Track and Field teams suddenly
found itself among the ranks of.
the homeless. The dilapidated
Whittle Track, though a poor
excuse for even a high school
track, had at least been suitable
fortraining and low-caliber meets.
Now, though, the teams find them-
selves facing the prospect of at
least an entire season without
anything resembling an adequate
training facility. -

The decision to expand
Richardson Field for soccer was
made to accommodate the bur-
geoning numbers of fans turning
out to see Davidson’s rise to na-
tional prominence; the Davidson
Soccer Stadium, with its one long
set of bleachers, simply could no
longer adequately handle the
number of fans wishing to see
high-profile games. That expan-
sion also forced the construction
of a new football practice field
(located behind Baker Sports
Complex), since a Soccer game
could not reasonably be held ona
field chewed up by a week of
football practice.

Ironically, though , the whole
affair could ne peared
ible boon one ‘Wack teams! For
while they will almost certainly
be forced to do without a home
track during the upcoming spring
track season, the College is now
forced to build a new track, pre-
sumably afi 8-lane, composition
(rubber) track appropriate for a
Division I program. In fact, soc-
cer coach Charlie Slagle even has
a theory, which seems feasible,
about how the logistics of such a
construction could be worked out.

In Slagle’s scheme, the new
track would be built on what are
now the Upper IMAC fields, with
the new women’s soccer field in
the center. What is now the
Davidson Soccer Field would
become the new IMAC fields,
with the bleachers being moved
up to the ' ‘women’s soccer field.
The men’s soccer team would
simply play all of its home games
at Richardson Field. Simple. -
Of course, the construction
of a en. track is a

Swimmers Start Practice,
Prepare for Another Season

By Seth McLaughlin

Swimming and diving at
Davidson has a proud past but has
been virtually non-existent since
1982. Indeed, as recently as 1981,
Davidson compiled an
11-2 record and was
one of the powers of
the Southern Confer-
ence. Only recently,
with thecompletion of
the Baker Sports Com-
plex and Cannon Na-
tatorium, has interest
in aquatics been re-
kindled.

This year
Davidson will once
again field a competi-
tive Division I team
for both men and
women. The team will
be led by Davidson
Aquatics Director Ron
Morrow and Assistant
Coach Trish Smith (a
1991 graduate). Morrow brings 18
years of coaching experience and
loads of enthusiasm to Wildcat
Swimming and Diving.

Morrow hopes “to provide a

competitive Division I situation
for athletes who want to swim at
Davidson.” While he notes that
Davidson “can’t compete with the
big boys, such as Stanford and

Texas,” the Wildcats can certainly
make a name for themselves.
Indeed, the opportunity exists
for the Wildcats to serve notice to
area teams, with meets against

Football Preview:
Clinch Valley at
Davidson College

By Chris Hood

At first glance, Davidson’s
home football opener against
Clinch Valley on September 14
appears to be a cakewalk for the
‘Cats.

After all, this is the Highland
Coraliers’ first season of varsity
football and all but four members
of the squad are freshmen. Never-
theless, Wildcats Head Coach Dave
Fagg is approaching the contest
with cautious optimism.

Clinch Valley has a veteran
coach in Bill Ramseyer, and one of
Ramseyer’s assistant coaches is
Caroll Dale, the school’s athletic
director and a former NFL All-
Pro.

“These folks are obviously dead

serious about their football,” Fagg
said. “We don’teven want tocome
close to thinking that this is less
than a physical, real, real well-
coached football team.”

Until they receive a game film
from Clinch Valley’s 13-8 winover
Tusculum Saturday, Coach Fagg
and his staff will know little more
about their foes than the informa-
tion on the team’s roster.

What is impressive about Clinch
Valley’s roster is the tremendous
size of many of the players.
Davidson will certainly be facing a
larger team when it takes the field
September 14. Fagg’s main con-
cern is that the size deficit facing
his troops will overshadow the
Wildcats’ advantage in experience.

UNCC, Georgia Tech, Georgia
Southern, and Emory slated this
season. Morrow hasalso succeeded
in bringing the Southern States
Swimming and Diving Champi-

onships to Davidson this year.
According to Morrow, this is a
“huge meet” and the first of its

pete with 45 travelling members
but Morrow is not against having a
larger squad. He may have just
sucha group; as many as 64 people
had expressed an interest in swim-
ming and diving before practice
was slated to begin.

Morrow hopes to have even
more people involved. “Being that
this is the first year, everyone has a
chance,” he says. “If you have any
swimming background, we can
train you to compete.”

Practice started for the team
September 9th, but those interested
can come at any time. The team
practices Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays from 2:30 - 4:30 in the
afternoon and Tuesdays and Thurs-
days from 6:00 - 8:00 in the morn-
ing. That’s correct; from six until
eight in the morning. That just
goes to show the Davidson ideal
(so obvious during exam periods)
that anything worth having is worth
working for. Morrow and Smith
believe in that ideal- (after all,
they’re getting up even earlier than
the team) and are committed to the

NCAA Changes Rules

New NCAA regulations limit the amount of time spent per week
in varsity athletic activities to 20 hours per week, with amaximum of

at- | 4 hours in one day, and at least one day off. Included in those 20 hours
be | are practice, competition, required weight training/conditioning, re-

| quired film reviews, meetings initiated by coaches about athletic
| matters and other “athletically related activities.” All varsity athletes

must meet with Compliance Director Ray Ingram to become familiar
with the new regulations.

Livesey Drafted
by New York Yankees

By Jack Handey

When the New York Yankees selected Davidson third baseman
Steve Livesey with their 35th Round pick in June’s Major League
Baseball amateur draft, it marked the fifth straight year thata Davidson
baseball player has moved on tothe professional ranks. In fact, the Yan-
kees organization has become a gathering place for Davidson baseball
alumni. Former Wildcat Bill Masse’s .365 batting average at Class AA
Albany leads the entire Yankees organization, and ex-Wildcat Rob
Eenhoorn, a New York-Penn League (Class A) All-Star a year ago, is
presently playing for the Yankees’ Class A farm team atPrince William. _

Livesey rebounded from reconstructive knee surgery to hit .246 for
Davidson in 1991, including 4 homers, and drove in 28 runs. Remarka-
bly, he also stole seven bases in nine tries, The Yankees’ selection of
Livesey was, as Yankee great Yogi Berra once said, “deja vu all over
again.” New York also drafted him after his senior year of high school
in 1986, but Livesey elected tocome to Davidson. Livesey was assigned
to the Class A Oneonta Yankees of the New York-Penn League.
