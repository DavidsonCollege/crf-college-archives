Bruce and the Black Anglo-Saxon Punks Psycho-a family film

Remember this summer? Re-
member the broiling sun, the
cold women, the phone bill you
couldn’t pay and (above all) the
boring tunes by groups like the
Cars, Kansas and Charlie Dan-
iels that made the radio sound
like the ‘‘Time Magazine Record
Hour.’’ Well, the Talking
Heads and Bruce Springsteen
have brought us very palatable
cures for those Summertime
Blues.

musically creative. release I’ve
heard this year. Brian Eno,
David Byrne and the Talking

musical element of American
Black music, added their own
psycho-electric sound and _ for-

polyphonic weapon aimed at
changing our narrow concep-

In the majority of his recor-

acted only as producer, but here
the rock pioneer has co-written,
sung and played on every song.
His presence adds complexity
and fine synthesizer parts to the
music without diminishing the
unique sound of the Talking
Heads. All of the tracks offer a
sensuous feast of rythmic sound
that surround some very good
lyrics. Most of this music could
be thought of as ‘‘subversive
soul’’ or ‘‘punk funk’ (yes, a

new wave P-funk!) but a couple
of the songs fit into a less
conven sense.

‘‘Listéhing Wind’’ sounds
African and it tells the story of
frustrated mojique who wants
to drive Americans out of ‘his
country (but where is it?) ‘‘Born
under Punches’”’ and ‘‘The
Great Curve”’ have lyrics that
relate only impressions of
meaning through the use of
many overlapping vocal lines.
The intense psychedelic sound
of ‘The Overload’’ rounds out
this group of songs that deal
mainly with the perils of being
involved everyday with the
human race. [emai in Light

most pop/soul music seem silly

The Comedi Inn will not go so

which is considered ‘‘sacred

Comments
And
Justifications
Anticipating possible questions, we

offer the following comments and justifi-
cations for some of the changes that are

being proposed.

1. The use of competency require-

ments as opposed to course require-
ments is expanded by the inclusion of
mathematics. This change is recom-
mended because students currently may
complete a Davidson degree without

taking. courses in mathematics or de-

monstrating a proficiency.

Additionally, the committee recom-
mends a strengthening of the foreign
language proficiency requirement by
requiring completion of a fourth term
taken at Davidson. After long* discus-
sions with members of our foreign
language departments and after a careful
examination of staffing and enrollments,
the majority of the committee are
convinced of the practicality as well as
the desirability of this recommendation.
Members of the language
consulted believed that under the pre-
sent arrangements students often do not

“ acquire eno ugh language competence to

constitute the ‘critical mass’’ that would
most likely insure a continuing interest
in the language and facility in its use. To
meet another culture on its own terms, in

_its own language, is an educational

experience so basic and so pervasive in

its ramifications that the committee feels
it is well worth the sacrifice of a possible
elective. The committee also believes
that the institution of a fourth course
will cause students to maximize their
preparation in language and avoid
repeating the beginning course, as now
they all too commonly do. As the
President’s Commission on Language
Study has noted, the United States is no
longer in a position to dictate to the
world on its own terms. We must
increase our efforts to build bridges to
other societies, nations, and cultures. If
Davidson must assume the educational
leadership in equipping them for their
future roles.

2. Although our proposals would
require that students take only two
courses in Area I, we feel that the
requirements have actually been
strengthened. Note that students may
not use courses taken to satisfy the
composition requirement to satisfy the
Area I requirement. Currently, students
may use two composition courses in
fulfilling Area I requirements. More-
over, the fourth course of the foreign
language requirement most often will be
a course in literature. The committee
believes also that a liberally educated
person should have had at least ‘one
course in the literature of: his own
language.

3. The proposed Area II requirements
differ from current requirements in two

‘major ways. First, students will be

required to take one course in philoso-
phy. The current requirements allow a
student to take three in religion. Second,
at least one course taken to satisfy the
religion requirement will be a course
which deals primarily with the Christian
faith. Currently students may satisfy
the religion requirements without taking
such a course.

The committee feels that students
should be introduced to systematic
thinking about the nature of reality and
about human values. The committee also
feels that the College’s philosophy and
statement of purpose require at least one |
course in the Christian faith.

4. Because a mathematics literacy
requirement has been added, Area III
distribution requirements have been
reduced to two courses. A student may
continue to satisfy this area requirement
by taking only one course in a natural
science.

5. Area IV requirements have been
made more specific. The committee feels
that every student should have a basic
knowledge of Western history. A know-
ledge of one’s basic cultural heritage is
the first step in expanded self-awareness
and the best hope for a common ground
of intellectual experience with fellow
students. The committee has concluded
that today’s world demands an under-
standing of basic economic principles.

The following declaration by Ben W.
Lewis (American Economic Review, -
May 1970, LX, No. 2) sums up the
committee’s view: ‘‘An understanding of
economics by all who participate is vital

‘to the functioning and preservation of a

self-governing society.’’ Most Davidson
undergraduates do in fact perceive this
need, which the committee feels is
urgent enough to require that all
students ,take a course in economics.

6. The committee believes that at least
some acquaintance with the non-West-
ern world is an essential part, of a liberal
education today and that a non-Western
course be required. The course should be
one that provides students with an

awareness of the pluralism in the world

and a familiarity with other cultures.
When a similar proposal was brought to
