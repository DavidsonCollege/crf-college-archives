SERCH and COMA merge to face minority issues

By Randy Hartwell

Ina move largely initiated by
SGA president Eric Rosenbach,
Students for the Establishment of
Racial and Cultural Harmony and
the Council On Minority Affairs
will, under an SGA resolution,
begin to coordinate activities un-
der a larger umbrella organization
with the purpose of establishing
racial and cultural harmony.

“They are two very similar

organizations with similar goals,
and there’s no reason why they
shouldn’t work together,”
Rosenbach says.

Under the new structure,

. COMA, whose seven voting mem-

bers are appointed by the SGA, will
concern itself with policy making,
while SERCH, a student organiza-
tion open to anyone, will provide
student programs to supplement that
policy.

SERCH President Jo Burrows
thinks the reorganization will be
very effective. “The better com-
munication will give it [the new
organization] more clout,” Bur-
OWS says.

COMA members will begin
to attend SERCH meetings, and
SERCH members can offer input
at COMA meetings. But
Rosenbach stresses that each will
still remain a separate organiza-

tion. “They’re not losing their
namesake or their identity,” he says,

COMA co-chairs Anni
Kirkland and Tasha Jenkins are
excited about the rejuvenation the
new stucture will provide. “We
want to gather what students feel
the issues are—we want to repre-
sent as many interests as possible,”
Kirkland says. “Anyone can come
to COMA meetings, and we en-
courage that; right now, we’re in

the information gathering stage.”

To find this information,
Kirkland and Jenkins have already
met with the Admissions office,
RLO, and FLAG and will continue
meeting with other organizations
soon. With the reorganization,
SERCH and COMA will become
stronger-felt presences on campus.
“Tt will make it more real for stu-
dents,” Jenkins says.

More Movies at the
Lake: theater adds
four more screens

By Sarah Teachworth

Davidson College students
who didn’t believe that Cornelius
could possibly become more en-
tertaining are in for a shock. It’s
happening. Movies at the Lake is
adding four more theaters onto the
original complex, making a grand
total of 12 screens.

Cinema executives believe
that they have enough business to
sustain the extra theaters because
the nearest theater is in Statesville.
Construction on the building has
already begun and is scheduled to
continue until late December or

early January.

Management does not expect
increases in ticket or concession
prices to defray the costs of the
new facilities. You can still see a
current flick for $5.50 (or $3.75 for
matinees). And for those in the
know, students can purchase movie

~ vouchers for only $4.00 at the

Union desk. These vouchers are
good for any movie at any Eastern
Federal theater.

The only difference in the new
Movies at the Lake is that in the
future, it will be even more diffi-
cult to decide which movie to see.

Davidson students will soon have an extra four movies from which to select.

Women’s group supports survivors of sexual assault

By Beth Bacon

Date rape is happening on
Davidson’s campus, according to
Nance Longworth, who works part-
time at the Davidson counseling
center. She leads a sexual assault
Support group that meets every
Wednesday night for approxi-
mately an hour.

Despite small beginning three
years ago, 12 to 15 women at-
tended regularly last year. The
group is now in the building pro-
cess again, as only three women
regularly attend meetings. “I en-
courage women to take advantage

of this,” says Longworth. “It’s a
non-pressure, low-key situation.
You can come and sit and say
nothing if you want.”

She says that the first step for
women interested in attending is to
call the counseling center to set up
an individual appointment in order
to see if the group is “what will
work for them, because walking in
the door for the first time is the
hardest thing,” says Longworth.
She suggests bringing a friend to
the first meeting.

others won’t understand or think
that “you made it yp.” The support
group provides a “community with
a lot of fostering.” There are both
talkers and listeners who together
“work through problems and make
sense of everything.”

Hackett was raped at the age -

of 14 and didn’t tell anyone about
it until just last year. She now says,
“Don’t hide if you are a victim
because there are other people who
can help you. In hiding you do
more harm than good,”

Hackett says that at the begin-
ning of last year, the group dis-
cussed whathad happened tothem,
worked through the event, made

sense of it, and realized it was not
their fault. By the end of the year,
they had moved on to talking about
relationships and deciding what a
good relationship entailed. “It [the
support group] helps us take an
awful event in our lives away from
the focus.”

been the best thing for me in deal-
ing with it,” she says. “It’s hard to
understand unless you’ve been
through it, and we want to encour-
age anyone to come because it’s
really supportive.” She says that
the healing process is “like a tran-
sition from victim to survivor.”

“T think it makes us stronger...
just dealing with it. It’s a great
release,” Hackett says. The group
allows those who attend to “grow
and figure out a lot about them-
selves.”

“One of every four women is
asurvivor,” says Longworth. This
includes survivors of sexual as-
sault, abuse, rape, and date rape.
According to statistics, freshmen
women, are at the greatest risk of
being sexually assaulted.

“I wish people would be more
open,” Hackett says. “There are
ways to deal with it. You don’t
have to hide it.”
