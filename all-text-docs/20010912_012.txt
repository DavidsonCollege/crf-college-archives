The third-ranked Davidson Wildcats saw
their nation-leading 18-game win streak come
to an end in sweltering heat on Saturday,
when the No. 8 Jacksonville Dolphins
trounced them 45-3.

Junior quarterback Paul Nichols had his
‘worst game as a Davidson starter on Satur-
day, completing just 12 of 32 passes for 86
yards and throwing a career-high five inter-
ceptions. The Wildcats’ last loss came on
September 25, 1999 to Emory & Henry.

An impressive group of Davidson support-
ers, including many parents and college presi-
dent Bobby Vagt , made the trip to Florida as
Davidson hoped to tie the fifth-longest win-
ning streak in Division I-AA history.

The game, hyped in the Jacksonville pa-
pers because of Davidson’s record, began on
an ominous, note when Dolphin defensive
man Jeremy Kearson intercepted a Nichols
pass midway through the first quarter and
returned the pick for an 81-yard touchdown.

Jacksonville ends Davidson win streak, 45-3

After Dolphin Linj Shell took Nichols’ sec-
ond interception in for six, Nichols was inter-
cepted yet again, this time by Dolphin Matt
Marshall, who also returned the pick for a
touchdown.
Marshall’s
interception put _
the Dolphins up
21-0, equaling
the total num-
ber of points al-
lowed by the
‘Cats in the first
quarter all last
season. The
three intercep-
tions along with
two rushing touchdowns accounted for the
Dolphins’ 35 unanswered points in the first
half--all but sealing a Jacksonville victory.
The Wildcats’ lone score came in the open-
ing drive of the second half as kicker Daniel
Hanks capped off a 57-yard drive with 35-

yard field goal. The 35-point half posted by —

ning and regroup.”

the Dolphins proved too much to overcome
as the ‘Cats suffered their worst defeat in
three years. ‘

The Wildcats will indeed look to regroup

Homecoming game. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m.
in Richardson Stadium.

I walked into my hall lounge Saturday
night to check the score of the Tennessee/
Arkansas game, and it was there I first found
out that Jacksonville ended our football streak.
[heard the bad tidings from a girl watching a
tennis game and doing Spanish homework.
She hadn’t heard the news from a player;
she’d bothered to listen to the game live via
the internet.

I was naturally shocked to hear the news of
the football team’s first loss in 19 games. My
surprise soon fell, however, to an impressed
awe of our school’s devotion. At 10 p.m. on
a Saturday night I saw a girl doing Spanish
homework because she spent part of her day
listening to our football game taking place in
Jacksonville, Fla. Enthusiasm for something
on this campus beyond books or beer? I'll be
kerschnickered.

School spirit manifests itself in a myriad of
ways at Davidson, and more often than not
the fan support is felt and not seen. Saturday
night I wondered how great it must feel to
walk on a football field two states away and
know that perfect strangers at my school
support me at that very minute. Naturally the
physical presence of fans lights the prover-
bial fire under the ass, but win or lose David-
son athletes boast support.

We’ re acompetitive breed here in our little
bubble; about one-fourth of our student body
participates on the varsity level, and 90 per-
cent of the leftovers play club or intramural
sports. Somewhere between academia and
athletics we find time to live and support
friends in their endeavors.

I am entreating the students at this school
to remain stoic and supportive in the face of
adversity. At few other times in your life will
you need support from friends and fans. I
urge y’all to carry this sense of camaraderie
to the field and the stands—even if Spanish
homework needs to be done.
