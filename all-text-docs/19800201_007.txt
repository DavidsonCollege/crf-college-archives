Suppressed Desires and Amicable Parting start Midwinters off

‘It’s a challenge to direct
students being a student my-
self,” said junior Julie Webber,

“especially when one of them.

has previously directed a work-
shop production.’’ Webber is
director of Amicable Parting
written by George Kauffman
and Leueen MacGrath.

The play involves a married
couple who are in the process of
getting a divorce. Both charac-
ters are theater people; Bill
Reynolds, played by Jack Hall,
is a playwright and his wife
Alicia, played by freshman
Marni Crosby, is an actress.

“The couple who wrote the
play are a playwright and an
actress who at one time had
marital problems,”’ said Web-
ber. ‘‘I’m assuming that the
play is sort of autobiographi-
cal.”

Set in modern times, the play
is.a situation comedy with
many one-liners.

Esther Bruce, also a junior, is
directing Supressed Desires by
Susan Glaspell. ‘‘It’s also a
situation comedy taking place
in the late 1930’s,”’ said Bruce.

“The story concerns a woman
who is interested in psycho-
analysis and analyzes every-
thing her husband does. Her
sister comes to visit and also
takes an interest in psychoanal-
ysis. The husband decides to do
something about his predica-

ment,’’ said Bruce, ‘‘and his
wife gets a taste of her own
medicine.’’

Freshman Eric Fichtner
plays the husband Stephen
Brewster. In their first David-
son production, freshman Tere-
sa Strawser plays the wife
Henrietta, and junior Julie Gi-

bert is her sister Mabel.

.. Both plays will be held in the
Workshop Theater and run
about’ a’ half hour each with a

short intermission between. --

Tickets are $1 for students,

Speed reading course contributes
to more effective learning

The Baldridge Reading and
Study Skills Program has en-
rolled seventy-seven Davidson
students—not through pro-
mises of War & Peace in one
sitting, but through a viable
system of improvement tech-
niques.

This year’s four-week, $95
program began about three
weeks ago. At the first session

instructor Debora Erie esta- -

lished and recorded individual
reading speeds; students have
since doubled, tripled, and in
one case, even quadrupled
word-per-minute reading rates

through a technique called mul-

ti-word reading.”’ This concept
involves reading phrases in-
stead of reading word by word
and is most effective when com-
bined with three other tech-

niques: ‘‘surveying,” “‘struc-
turing,’ and “annotating.”
Students ‘survey material
by glancing through it and
getting an overall picture before
reading closely, especially if the
material is technical in nature.

‘‘Structuring’’ and ‘‘annota-
ting’’ involve organizing and
note-taking. The program also
focuses on study schedules,
tests and examinations, re-
search papers, and vocabulary
development.

Although most students ad-
mit that these techniques are
not new to them, they are
nevertheless satisfied with the
program. As one put it, ‘They
make you do everything you’ve
always been too lazy to bother
with. It’s no miracle tech-
nique—you have to work. But
you can really tell a difference.”

Riding program stabilized and expanded

By AIDA DOSS |

Two years ago it didn’t exist.
But thanks to a lot of shoveling,
lifting, building, and grooming,
it does now.

The Davidson College Riding
Program, founded in the winter.
of 1977 by Kathy Woodward,
Katherine Whitney, and several
others is becoming one of the
most popular physical educa-
tion courses available. Virginia
Dummit, a senior who has

worked extensively at the sta- -

bles, said she was “surprised
and pleased’’ by the interest in

“hiorses and riding which was

expressed at the beginning and
which has continued to support

the program. Between forty and .

sixty students participate in
horseback riding each term,
with slightly fewer in the winter
when bad weather can make
riding unfeasible.

The first two horses were

bought from a school in Virginia.

and a third was donated. An

one mile this side of Hunters-

ville) were lent by Jim How-
ard, who owns a lumber com-
pany in Huntersville. In addi-
tion, Howard built a ring,
installed an electric fence to
keep the horses in their pasture,
helped clear cross country trails
for riding, and donated hay, a
tractor, and wood shavings
from his lumberyard for bed-
ding the horses. “He even gave

us & manure spreader,” laughed
Dummit.

The program has expanded to
the point that there are now

eleven horses in the barn, a

larger pasture, and a dressage
arena as well as a regular riding
ring. Dressage is a specialty
within the art of horseman-

ship— “it’s the ballet of riding,”
said Dummit. “It involves de-
veloping the horses gymnasti-

cally and developing communi-
cation with the horse to the
utmost.” The dressage arena is
rectangular in shape with a very
low, five-inch fence, lending it-
self to “gymnastic exercise and
precision.” The regular .riding
ring, enclosed by a higher
circular board fence, is used by
beginners and those taking
lessons.

The money to run. the stables
and the physical education pro-
gram comes exclusively from
the horses, who ‘‘earn their own

keep.’’ Lessons cost approxi- °

mately $40 per term, all of
which directly supports the
maintenance of the horses and
stables. Community riding pro-
grams in the summer have
helped boost revenues, as have
the sales of several donated
horses.

So far, the program has
supported itself, but the College
may soon assume more re-
sponsibility. ‘‘In the begin-
ning,” said Dummit, ‘‘the Col-
lege seemed sceptical about the
viability of the program. Now,

however, we feel we've proved

ourselves and the College recog-
nizes that.”

The next big step for the
program is a projected move to
the lake campus. Such a move .
would be beneficial for several.
reasons. First, it will be on

and ‘third, it will allow for
expansion, i.e. several barns
