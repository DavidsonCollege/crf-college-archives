SGA sets out to tackle drunk am |

By ADAM HICKEY
Staff Witer

At last Tuesday’s SGA meet-
ing President Bill Gullan formed a
committee designed to investigate
and reform the tendencies of
Davidson students to drive under
the influence of alcohol.

Gullan received inspiration for
the idea after working on the ad-
ministration-sponsored Alcohol
Policy Review Task Force last
spring.

To follow up the decisions of
the Task Force, Gullan then formed
acommittee to investigate the prob-
lem.

Because of exams and other
academic pressures, the commit-
tee did not become active until
now, revived by a dictate from
Gullan.

Gullan is specifically con-
cerned about the tendency of stu-
dents to leave campus after mid-
night on weeknights when Court
houses may no longer serve alco-
hol.

Gullan says he is personally

aware of instances where students
have chosen to leave campus for
bars and taverns which, according
to North Carolina state law, may
serve until 2 a.m.

Gullan recommended to the
Board of Trustees last spring that
the campus rule be changed, but
the Trustees voted not to extend
the serving time.’ '

With that option blocked,
Gullan now hopes to amend other
campus policies and practices in
an effort to curb the problem.

“The first order of business
for this committee . . . [is] to find
out how much drunk driving oc-
curs at Davidson College,” says
Gullan.

“From there we’re going to
analyze where and when it does
occur. Then we can find where the

- deficiencies causing this are.”

Gullan hopes the investiga-
tion alone will raise awareness to
the point that some students will of
their own volition choose to re-
frain from driving while intoxi-
cated.

mines the scope of the problem, it
will recommend possible reforms
such as offering on-campus activi-
ties at later hours and expanding
the rides committee in an effort
either to keep students on campus
or transport them safely.

The committee will meet for
the first time this week. “The rec-
ommendations will be out by the
time my term ends,” Gullan says,
though he is unsure if the commit-
tee can affect change as quickly.

The committee is composed
of seven students who represent
various classes and social affilia-
tions.

All committee members vol-
unteered during Tuesday’s meet-
ing and are elected officials of the
SGA.

Any student, however, who
would like to participate is wel-
come to join the committee, which
will be chaired by Gullan.

Though he hopes the commit-
tee willremedy the problem, Gullan
says, “The fact that people drive
drunk is just a fact of life we have
to live with.”

New committee works for
campus beautification

By Amy WHITMIRE
Staff Writer

Atthe SGA meeting last Tues-
day, SGA President Bill Gullan

formed anew BeautificationCom-

mittee in order to find ways to
make the campus look more aes-
thetically appealing.

Talking with former Dean
Rusk Program Director Jack Perry
inspired SGA President Bill Gullan
to do something about the appear-
ance of the campus. According to

Gullan, Perry said the cross-coun-
try trails are “abysmal.” Gullan
admitted that he couldn’t speak to
the state of the trails, but he said he
was inspired to look for other areas
to improve.

The committee plans to study,
for the purpose of recommending
to the Physical Plant, the trustees,
and the administration, problem
areas of the campus and find loca-
tions that can be improved. Com-
mittee members might also lead an
effort to beautify the campus by

picking up trash, particularly on
the Court after weekend parties.
Matthew Hobbie, a sopho-
more SGA senator who is a mem- *
ber of the new committee, stated:
“T think the committee is impor-
tant. I am personally annoyed by
the amount of trash I see around

‘campus and look forward to doing

anything I can to help.”

Gullan, the committee chair,
announced plans to find out stu-
dents’ opinions about the beautifi-
cation efforts in a future meeting.

experience and many do not hold
PhDs, they are paid less.

These recent hiring trends en-
acted to compensate for over-en-
rollment may have negatively af-
fected Davidson’s ranking in the
areas which comprise the “Faculty
Resources”
speculated.

However, Williams also said
that “the faculty have gotten good
raises” over the last ten years. “We
would like to do better in the area
of faculty compensation, but there

_ certainly wasn’t a drop,” he said.

Williams also stated that “‘vir-
tually 100 percent” of full-time
faculty hold PhDs.

category, Williams —

the top colleges,” Williams said.
“We think we are doing a very
good job.”

The other category in which
Davidson dropped is “Financial
Resources.” According to Kelton,
this category is divided between a
measure of educational program
expenditures per student and other
factors.

Under the former category are
the areas: instruction, student ser-
vices, academic support, and ad-
ministration,

The latter includes: research,
scholarships, public service, op-
erations/management.

Kelton said that when dealing
with statistics such as those used

‘by USNWR “a small difference

{in numbers] can make a huge dif-
ference in ranking.”

Kelton said the report can be a
springboard for the administration
to examine areas which may need
improvement. “As weanalyze this,
we may find there are some areas
we should be paying attention to.
We will have to look how other
schools have changed in relation
to how we have changed,” he said.

Kelton speculated that
Davidson’s lower ranking in the
category of “Financial Resources”
may not be the result of a decrease

in spending on its part.

It may be, said Kelton, that
other schools have had to spend
more money, as their operating
costs rise significantly because of
their location.

To operate a school in New
York City simply is more expen-
sive than to operate one in a rural
area, Kelton said. Kelton cited this
as one of the reasons many schools
have “higher annual budgets” than
Davidson.

Davidson students aren’t re-
ceiving an inferior education this
year as compared to last. “This
doesn’ t reflect any negative change
in the quality of a Davidson educa-
tion,” said Kelton.

In fact, in a survey of college
presidents, provosts, and deans of
admissions asking which schools
have “an unusually strong com-
mitment to undergraduate teach- -
ing” (from USNWR) Davidson
ranks tenth behind schools such as
Carleton and Swarthmore, num-
bers one and two respectively.

President Kuykendall said,
“Tt’s a pleasant thing to be included
in such good company.”

edition of U.S. News and World
Report.
