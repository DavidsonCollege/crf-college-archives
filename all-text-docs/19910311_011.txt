"Two Suns" Leads Davidson
Senior Alan Jones To Jazz Fame

By Andy Hackett
Senior Alan Jones, best known
in a musical capacity as pianist in
Davidson’s Jazz Ensemble, may
soon become known to the Char-
lotte area jazz/new age radio audi-
ence as a top new talent, due to
recent exposure of his original ma-
terial on the airwaves of thecon-
temporary jazz station WFAE.
Jones attended the North Caro-
lina School of the Arts intending to
concentrate on the cello, but fledg-
ling interests in jazz and experi-
mental electronic music led him
back to the piano, his first instru-
ment. Withinashort time, he earned
the spot as pianist in the school’s
big band.
Jones’ further forays into the
electronic arena continued when

he arrived at Davidson. Early last
year, an independent study in elec-
tronic music yielded the original
pieces compiled as “Electric Jour-
ney”, his self-produced demo tape.

This past fall, Jones began corre-
spondence with WFAE. Reproduc-
ing some of his songs on digital
audio tape, he submitted hischoice
compositions to the station’s pro-
gram directors.

Jones’ tenacity and. good ma-
terial has recently paid off; his
pieceentitled “Two Suns” has been
selected to enter the regular rota-
tion of the FAE program “Lights
Out” (Sunday-Friday, 10 p.m. to
12 a.m.).

“Two Suns” imparts an extrater-
restrial mood; Jones himself envi-
sioned “cold, dark space between

desolate planets...and out of the
void, a piano enters‘and develops
the theme.” His influence can be
subtly detected in his work--the
dramatic flair of Vangelis, the
understated melodicisms of Pink
Floyd’s Rick Wright, and the
atmospheres of synthesist Kitaro
are evident. Jones also sites key-
boardist Lyle Mays and Peter
Gabriel as influences.

Jones would like to pursue his
musical interest in the future; and,
given his ideas and experimental
tendencies, he could one day offer
something new to the musical
scene. Jones concludes, “I think
that, to be truly creative, one must
be aware of today’s technology,
yet transcend it and concentrate on
one’s art.”
