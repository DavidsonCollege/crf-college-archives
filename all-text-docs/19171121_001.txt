Davidson’s Share Wake Forest Humbled
is Oversubscribed By Red and Black

Splendid Total Made By Student/ Overwhelming Outclassed Despite
Subscribers to Fund. Weight. Score 72-7.

The Davidson Red-Skins left their
hunting grounds Saturday and took the
war-path to the city of Greensboro and
these completely massacred the settlers
from Wake Forest. ‘Fhey returned to
their wigwams and hung the scalp of
Wake Forest to the ridge pole, beside the
scalps of Auburn and V. M. 1.

The final score was 72 to 7—that is
as far as the scorer could count. For
the first few minutes of play, neither
team seemed to have the advantage, then
the Davidson warriors drew out and left
the Wake Forest teany as victims of x
steam-roller that could not be stopped.
Davidson politely asked Wake Forest to
excuse her dust.

The Y. M. C. A. War Fund cam-
paign was completed at Davidson last
week. Never before in the history of the
college was there such a universal spirit
of sacrifice as was manifested in this
campaign. Davidson's share was $2,000.

To organize for the canvass of the
student body about thirty-five prominent
men were collected for a meeting Wed-
nesday night. At this meeting they
were informed as to conditions and in-
spired to do their best. Seventeen
couples were formed who were to sec
every man in college the next night and
solicit his subscription. As the mecting
broke up it was announced that the re-
sults would be counted at it o'clock the
next night. The students responded
nobly to the appeal and the amount
crept steadily nearer the goal, $2,000, as
each additional couple came ino and re
ported. At 20 minutes past 16, when
the last team arrived and reported, a
cheer broke out. for it was seen that
Davidson had exceeded her — assigned
amount by $18. Several additional sub-
scriptions have been received since that
time and with the $160 subscribed by the
faculty, the total sum) subscribed now
amounts to $2,303.75.

‘The people of Davidson have not fail
ed to do their share in this campaign.
The amount raised was $660; $160 of
which will go to the students’ fund. Thi:
sneaks well for Davidson and shows that
she deeply feels the spirit of the times.
