The Y Student Service Corps
and Davidson Senior Citizens
are planning to. build a solar

- “the demand: of students out-
runs the supply of spaces.” The
program should be expanded,.
Spencer proposed, to fill this

. need.

Knowledge of non-Western
cultures will be essential since
the United States in increas-
ingly in a position of ‘‘shared
power” and “even dependence”
on other nations, Spencer said.
Earlier, the College had chosen
to concentrate in-depth on one
non-Western area by establish-
ing the South Asian Studies
program. In the future this

- approach should by comple-

mented by broader courses,
‘Spencer said. He cited the
growth of nationalism in Africa
as an example of one such
“broad” course.

In the area of language
study, ‘‘what we really need is
some imagination,’’ Spencer
said. He suggested new ap-
proaches to foreign language
instruction such as the. Berlitz
immersion technique or ‘‘a dou-
ble course for two terms.”’
Courses could make better use
of the language lab, he added.

Spencer explained in the in-
terview that he has no definite
proposals for the language pro-

' gram~but was “raising ques-

tions for the EPC to deal with.”
One third of all Davidson stu-

dents participate in a foreign.

study program before..they

‘the nuni:

bab NO third. "The increase
. in not unrealistic, Spencer said,
~ since the extent of foreign study

has increased phenomenally in

-. thie past, from one tenth of the

student body 20 years ago to
the present ratio.
Funding for language and

mental and corporate sources.

said. ‘It would simply allow us

Spencer compared his:  propo-
sals to the new Computer
Services Center project. In both
cases, institutional committ-
ment to the project depended on
full faculty support. Once the
faculty was committed to a new
curriculum, the Administration
would find thehecessary re-
sources and additional staff, he
said.

These are not short- term
proposals, Spencer said. Their
purpose is to ‘‘spark discus-
sion.” In the long run; he
added, ‘‘I think we’ll need more
proposals.”

The next 20 years will pro-
bably be as unpredictable as the
last 20; Spencer concluded.
Davidson's “good fortune” in

planning for the future, he said,
is that ‘‘the fulfillment of our
responsibility as a good college

coincides with our self-inter-

est.”
