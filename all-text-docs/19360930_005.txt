GREAT IMPROVEMENT
SEEN IN STUD STORE

During the past summer when
the rest of us were loafing, Hal
Overton and Stewart Barnes, the

managers of the student store, were
busy. They, with help of Davidson
workmen, have put a brand
addition on the back of the store.
Besides this they dug themselves
in and painted the interior of the

new

old store, which, with the increased

store-room, gives Our store a brand

room brought about by new

new appearance. In this store-room
are kept the empty bottle cases and
other unsightly objects which lit-

tered the front room formally. Also
the large packing case that used
to occupy a whole corner of the

store is kept back out of sight, leav-
ing room for more cold drinks to
be kept. Besides the improvements
already brought about by this addi-
tion there left room for

improvements in the future which
