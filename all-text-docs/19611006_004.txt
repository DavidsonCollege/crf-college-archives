“We are living in a religiously pluralistic society. and we need to understand and
appreciate the beliefs and practices of religious groups different from ours.” This
is the reason for the Contemporary Religions Course as stated by Dr. Max Polley,

course instructor.

“In this one-semester course.
new to Davidson this year,” ob-
served Dr. Polley, ‘we will ex-
amine the essential doctrines
and practices of Judaism. Rom-
an Catholicism. and many Pro-
testant denominations, including
Methodist. Presbyterian. Baptist,
Lutheran. Assembly of God,
Latter Day Saints, and Jehovah's
Witnesses.

To aid in this examination,
the class uses literature written
and prepared by men from the
religion or denomination under
study at the time.

Visits by representatives. of
ihe religion, usually men well
versed in the intricacies of their
beliefs.. also supplement. the
ordinary classroom procedures.
These visits are sometimes. :re-
paid by the class,-as illustrated
by “field trips” made in con-
junction with their present
study topic of Judaism.

Dr. Polley explained. “Rabbi
Samuels. from Temple Israel.
the conservative synagogue in
Charlotte. ahd Rabbi Gerber.
from Temple Beth-El. the re-
form synagogue in Charlotte,
made recent visits to the class to
talk and answer questions on
their positions in the Judaistic
faith, °

“Last Friday, the class visited
an evening service at Teniple
Israel to observe the ceremony
of Bar Mitzvah, and this Friday
we'll visit Temple Beth-E! to
observe the same ceremony as
conducted ijn the reform synago-
gue. Later in the course we will
make similar visits, for example,
attending a Catholic mass.”

‘Come Fly With Me’

BY WILLIAM WALKER
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Davidson students who are interested in aviation

will soon be able to take a

ground school course which

has proven 98% effective for passing the written exam-

The course is open to all stud-
ents including those who have
had flying experience but who
need to pass the FAA exam to
get their pilot's licenses. The
forty-hour course will cost
$40.00 and will be held on Mon-
day and Thursday nights in the
ROTC department during the

| first semester.

TAPES AND FILM
There will be a test at the
end of each phase of the ground
school, and a final exam at the

Wednesday, Oct. 11, at 8:15

ternity, will hold its first open
meeting of the year.

Henley Hurt, AED president,
and Bob Waugh, vice-president
and program chairman, working
with Dr. W. O. Puckett, have

change in another girl's room.| invited two representatives from
, d the Bowman Gray School of

Medicine at Wake Forest to lec-

This will begin a series of

swimming-dancing after-} meetings open to the entire

and featuring
speakers from the entire eastern
U. S. At each.of the meetings,
medical-scientific films will be
shown which are expected to

appeal to all students, pre-medi-,

cal and otherwise.

Hurt and Waugh stress, also,
that the fraternity especially
invites interested freshmen
and sophomores, even though
membership in AED is restrict-
ed to juniors and seniors.

During the first part of No-|

vember, the present twenty
members will initiate 15 to 20
upperclass pre-meds whose
grades have qualified them for
admission.

The course will be conducted

«flying at the airport include
Piper-cubs, Piper tri-pacers, and
Cesna sky hawks. Prices for
flying range from $10 to $17
per hour.

“Eventually, we hope to start
a flying club at Davidson if we
get enough people,” said Pep-
per. “Sgt. Locklear owns an air-
plane, and there is a second-
hand Piper super-cruiser we
would like to get.” Pepper said
that whether they could get the
plane would depend on the
number of people who were in-
terested in the flight club.

COUNCIL VESPERS
POLICY

The Student Council, at its
Monday night meeting, re-
‘affirmed its decision of last
year to uphold good conduct
in vespers. This move is, so
far, only a statement of
policy, since the council

plans to report no names un-
less the conduct at future
vespers services deteriorates.
This reaffirmation was pre-
cipitated by the vespers be-
havior this past Sunday.

the Committee on College

Blazers held a meeting during chapel period with the

[southern representative of

a New York company that

' specializes in blazers. The idea of the meeting was to get

some basic ideas on the type

and cost of blazers available

and to see what would be most appealing to Davidson

students.

Due to the growing interest
of students, the committee was
established last spring to inves-
tigate the possibility of class
blazers. The committee feels
that blazers would be an excel-
lent way of improving college
and class spirit.

The committee plans to meet
with two other companies be-

fore deciding what steps, if
any, might be practical in the
re-establishment of blazers at
Davidson.

The committee hopes to have
some recommendations on the
idea within two or three weeks.
At that time, a poll may be
made of classes to sound out
the feelings of the student body.

C. Shaw Smith, Director of
the College Union and one of
the advisers to the committee,
emphasized that the student
body would make ‘the final de-
cision on blazers. “We are not
attempting to dictate the tastes
or interests of students, but to
present all the facts on the idea.
Any student suggestions will be
welcomed by members of the
committee.”
