THE DAVIDSONIAN

Question

oO the Week

Since the announcement last week

in chapel of the revision of the cut
system, discussion of its merits has

been on every tongue. Here are
the statements of several represen-
tative men on the campus when
asked, “What do you think of the
recent revision of the cut system?”
Don Hott, Senior:

I'm all for it. I had a week's sick
cuts taken off the books and the
limit raised, it did lot of

responsible for its added freedom,
and we should remember that when
we are inclined to have a demon-
stration such heretofore has

Leonard Menius, Senior:

I am in favor of the new cut sys-
tem. I think that the number of cuts
allowed should be on an ascend-

more cuts because the upperclass-

and also
because it offers a reward for three
of good hard work. How-
I think that the main thing
that" was” wrong With the Old sys-
tem was that overcutting was not
penalized enough, not that we were
allowed too many cuts.

Frank Hall, Junior:

In my opinion the present revised
cut system is a great improvement
over that in force at the beginning
of the year. Nonetheless, I feel that
it could improved

which is a mere-matter of two cuts

number of hours carried by the stu-
dent any such

Jim. Kerr, Sophomore:

stated that the cuts were granted
only for the benefit of those who
needed them in case of illness. This
was apparently based on the as-
sumption that seniors got sick al-
most twice as often as freshmen,
for the former received fourteen
to the latter’s eight! This has been
rectified to the contentment of all,
and sick cuts-are no longer counted
against one’s unexcused cut record.
Notwithstanding, I feel that those
