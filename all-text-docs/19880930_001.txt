Terry holds forum on
weekday parties

By GARY WHEELER
A forum on “Parties at Davidson” was
held in the Art Gallery on September 20.
Dean of Students Will Terry opened by
expressing his concerns about “the prolif-
eration and intensification of weekday
parties.”

More particularly, Terry is disturbed at °

the number of fraternity sponsored parties
spreading to the residence halls.

After Terry’s introductory remarks, the
topic was opened for discussion. Party is-
sues discussed were:
¢ Whether the amount of weekday parties
has increased with the semester system.
The effect of weekday parties on ab-
sences this year;
¢ How much parties take away from other
activities on campus..
¢ What implications- administrative re-
strictions on weekday parties might have.

Patterson Court parties are registered in
the Dean of St
‘hall and peri house parties are to be
registered | the Residence Life Of-

fice. So far this year there have been nine
weekday evening parties registered by fra-

competed eating ea courte of Unda Fale
tite mab

Office, and residence

Court. Residence halls and perimeter hous-
ing have hosted ten week-night parties.

This far into school last year, there were
nine week-night parties registered through
the Residence Life Office. (The Patterson
Court party figures from 1987 are notavail-
able).

The issue of whether or not absences
have increased is not clear, because profes-
sors are not required to take attendance.

Senior John Sellers; who admits to at-
tending “a lot” of week-night parties in the
past, expresses his regret on “passing up
other weekday events; not so much study-
ing, but missing out on other things like
good speakers and performances. . . I just
want the freshman to know that there will
always be weekday parties, but you don’t
always have the chance to see something
like Macbeth on campus.”

Sophomore Alan Rosselot does not see a
need for college restrictions on week-night
parties, saying that it would “create-a con-
troversy that doesn’t need to happen. Col-
lege students are mature enough to know
when to study and when to party. People
are going to party no matter what, whether
it’s on the Court or in their rooms.”

Carleton Pritchard hopes that the
new Campus Network computer
system will “broaden the use of
the student meal card” and “ex-

” pand services presently available
- to the student body.”

The system, installed last week,
is now operating in the Vail
Commons and the Union Cafe.
Students who subscribe to the

’ college dining service have been:

issued a temporary “CAT card”
that will allow access ‘to the new

system. ae

Each card has a magnetic strip
on the back side. The strip is en-
coded with the students name,
identification number and meal
plan (10, 14 or 19 meals per
week).

When a student enters the

3 Commons or purchases a meal in

the Cafe, a dining services em-’

Junior Tim Sparks addresses the campus forum on parties,

the computerized card reader.
The reader then sends the infor-
mation encoded on the strip over
phone lines to the mainframe
computer located on the west
balcony of the Commons. The
amount of meals left for the week
along with the student’s identifi-
cation number is sent back to the
card reader where it is displayed
on the digital terminal screen.
‘The system’s capabilities are
not limited to keeping track of the
student meal plan. According to

“Pritchard, the system will be

implemented in several other stu-
dent services across campus;
hence the name “Campus Net-
work.”

Pritchard plans to install the
_ system in the student store and the
uses for the new cards in the li-
brary and the Athletics Complex.

New payment method introduced

a sum of money into a CAT card

account.

.. Students will then be able to use
the card just as they would money
in all:services outfitted with the
system. Meals in the Commons,
food items in the Cafe, books and
supplies in the student store, and
laundry bills could all be paid for
using the card.

This creates a new option for a
student meal plans. Instead of
purchasing a 10, 14, or-19-meal
plan, students can deposit money
to use for meal purchase.
Pritchard expects most students to
stay with the traditional meal
plans because it “makes it easier
to budget their money week-by-
week.”

Most students react positively
to the new system. Junior Bruce
Newsome likes the fact that “it
