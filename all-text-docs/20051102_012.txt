Depending upon the result of a UNC-G

either the No. 1 or No.2 seed and will
take on either Georgia Southern or
Wofford this Saturday, both of whom
have conference records of 1-6. The
game is a good opportunity to cheer for
the team as they make a run for the
SoCon title.

To my relief, the NBA starts this week.
My advice is to go watch our basketball
team’s exhibition game against
Concordia at 6:30 p.m. and then come
back and catch a bit of the Spurs and
Cavs. The champs will be playing
Lebron’s team in what should be a good
early season match-up. Even though
Spurs had a 1-7 preseason record, I’m

"picking them to win at home.

Sooners lose to Texas: Conspiracy?

Oklahoma has won seven championships
since 1950. It’s held the conference title 39
times. Four Sooners have taken home the
Heisman Trophy and the last time they lost
more than two games was over five years
ago. In a preseason poll, Oklahoma was

ranked an intimidating No. 3, and fans -

believed that yet another Big 12 Conference
banner would be hung in Memorial Stadium
for all young Sooners to see and venerate.

The hopes and dreams, however, came
crashing down this year as Oklahoma lost
resoundingly to rival Texas for the first time
since 1999 and brought their record to 2-3.
Now, after three more games and three more
wins, their record has improved to 5-3 over-
all, but the season isn’t over yet.

What can account for this deterioration of
a team that last year went 12-1 overall and 8-
0 in the Big 12? First, I thought: It has to be
graduated seniors. I mean, Jason White has
gone on to bigger and better things, Jammal
Brown, Vince Carter, Mark Clayton,
etcetera, all very good and all absent from
the Crimson roster. But Oklahoma players
are always good, and I can’t believe that the
AP poll would fail to take into account the
loss of superior players. So, I went to the
Sooners website,
looking for clues.
Then it hit me.

In his seventh
season as coach atf
OU, Bob Stoops
has taken three
Conference titles
and one brilliant
undefeated season
in 2000, and he’s
generally
the Sooner squad
into a juggernaut
of football domi-|
nation. In 2004, he ©

So what’s so different about 2005? This
season, the worst in five years for OU, has
been a year of change in many arenas outside

Conspiracy against the American people featuring Stoops (right) and Roberts (left).

Roberts is just five years older than Stoops.
They both have brown hair, pale eyebrows,
and a goofy smile. A little plastic surgery,
and these guys are interchangeable.

Obviously, somebody pulled a switch.

Roberts, former lawyer and native of New
York State, is now coaching. the Sooners.
Stoops, husband to Carol and loving father
of Mackenzie, Isaac, and Drake, is making
judicial decjsions under the guise of a con-
servative Republican Chief Justice.

Stoops wouldn’t be the worst judge ever.
He’s used to making tough decisions, and he
graduated from the University of Iowa,
ranked an underestimated No. 60 in U.S.
News and World Report’s Top Universities
list. It’s no Harvard, which is Robert’s alma
mater, but unlike the Chief Justice, he did
play varsity ball at his school for four years.

Roberts had a very short career in football,
and though he played at Notre Dame
Elementary in Michigan City, Ind., in 1968,
he was considered slow. With this modest
background, he’s definitely less inclined to
succeed in his new position than Stoops.

The Somebody who initiated this substitu-
tion is just as blatantly obvious as the swap
itself. Who could possibly have enough
power and enough of a motive to want to do
this? It’s not an accident that both Roberts’
appointment and Oklahoma’s loss to the
Longhorns occurred recently. The pride of
the Lone Star State and
huge Texas football fan,
President George W.
Bush, must have called in
some pretty big favors. I
don’t know how he did it,
or how he got Stoops and
Roberts to play along, but
I’m not ruling out brain-
washings and mind-alter-
ing drugs.

You might call me
crazy. You might say that
I’m drawing conclusions
with completely unrelated
facts and irrelevant data.
You might even say that
Oklahoma’s season will
turn around in the last
three games and that I’m
blowing three losses in
the first five games out of
proportion. Well, we’ll see.

Have you ever noticed how much new

Wildcats split games to end season

By JAMIE WILL
Staff Writer

The field hockey team com-

peted twice this past weekend in
its last two regular season
matches leading into the
NorPac conference tournament.
This past Saturday, at
Davidson’s Belk Turf field, the
Wildcats defeated NorPac rival
Longwood 1-0 on an Emily
Davis ’06 goal in the second
period.
Despite Longwood having
seven penalty corners, com-
pared to Davidson’s four,
Davidson kept Longwood off of
the scoreboard, with goalie
Rachel Kiselewich ’07 posting
her first career shutout.

Although the first half ended
in a 0-0 tie, after the break the
Wildcat offense came out
strong and got the home team

minute. Davis’ eighth goal of the season, the
game-winner, came on the fifth assist of the
season from Kayli Maxwell ’08, who drib-
bled into the circle and crossed the ball to
Davis for the touch-in goal.

The ’Cats outshot Longwood 12-8. With

The ’Cats beat Longwood 1-0 and lost to Lock Haven 3-4.

this victory, Davidson improved its record to
5-9 overall and 2-4 in the conference head-
ing into the final regular season match
against Lock Haven.

Lock Haven, a strong team boasting a 13-
5 record heading into competition with

Davidson this past Sunday at
the Belk Turf field, held on to
defeat the Wildcats 4-3.
Davidson ended the regular
season, with a 5-10 oVerall
record and a 2-4 NorPac con-
ference record.

The match consisted of 20
combined penalty corners
awarded by the officials, and
both teams used them to their
advantage. On one of these
comers, Britti Himelfarb °09
scored the first goal for
Davidson and her third of the
year, with 17:42 on the clock.
With the goal, she cut Lock
Haven’s lead in half at 2-1.

The repeated efforts to come
back would not be enough for
Davidson as Lock Haven
would go on to score two more
goals to Davidson’s two, keep-
ing the lead intact. Kelly
Brennan ’07 and _ Ginnie
Friddell ’08 contributed the
other two goals, both unassisted, for
Davidson, and keeper Kiselewich had five
saves.

Davidson now heads out to Berkeley, CA,
for the NorPac conference tournament, set to
take place Nov. 3-5.
