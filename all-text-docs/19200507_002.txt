THE DAVIDSONIAN, May 7, 1920.

RAINS GO DOWN IN DEFEAT
AT HANDS OF SOPHS.

DAVIDSON REPRESENTATIVES
AT R. O. T. C. SUMMER

In a regular up-hill game, ‘the
Sophs overcame a three run lead
and proceeded to pound out an 8 to
4 victory over the Seniors. The
Seniors got hog wild in the opening
stanza and pounced on Robert's
delivery for a trio of counters. The
Sophs fighting doggedly however,
finally evened things up in. the
seventh,

The features of the contest was
the all round playing of “Sandy”
Erwin. This spry youth from
Bailey, knocked out a triple that
decided the contest, and then caught
a hot liner, relaying it to second, to
first, completing a neat triple play
and incidently killed an attempted
Senior‘rally.

Cathey had the Sophs guessing
during the earlier stages of the
game but his support weakened, and
towards the last easy chances went
for safeties. Roberts had a first
inning as wild as a March hare, but
calmed down after that, and had the
“Brains” eating out of his hand.

LAST GAME OF SEASON GOES
TO FURMAN, 3 TO 1.
H Lads Fail to Hit at Opportu-
Omnities, ‘Team Fields Well.

The last game of the season
witnessed the defeat of the Red and
Black team at the hands of the
Baptists in Greenville by the score
of 3to 1. The game was a fast and
very pretty one, barring the tricky
tactics of Furman.

“Buck”

It has never been the policy of
Davidson to kick or offer an alibi
for losing a game, but on this oc-
casion she has just grounds. The
Furman pitcher continually scratch-
ed the ball by means of tacks in his
belt in order to use What is termed
an “enemy bal,l’ and is far from
considered good

i

While it not only aided him it handi-
capped our pitcher in his delivery.
This is not the only complaint that
can be made against Furman, but
why state more? The opinion of
the whole Davidson team is that
Furman should be completely drop-
ped from her schedule hereafter.

Currie pitched excellent ball and
under ordinary conditions should
have won, Padget by means of his
“feak” delivery alson twirled a very
good game. For Furman Nixon
starred with the stick, getting three
hits out of four up. For Davidson
Crawford and Ratchford put up the
best brand of ball, each getting two
hits.

ELON AND TRINITY ‘
BOW BEFORE
DAVIDSON TENNIS TEAM

Our tennis team returned to the
Hill Monday grandly and rightfully
bearing the “Veni, Vedi, Vici” ban-
ner. For while our baseball team
was losing two hard luck games to
Tech, and out tract team being bare-

ly nosed out of second place in the,

state meet; Hawkins and Spence
were conquering Elon and Trinity
across the tennis net.

The team left here Tuesday and
arrived at Elon Wednesday morn-

sportsmanship.|ing. In the afternoon of that day

Olx—3 5 3

Hawkins and Spence defeated Gray
and Newman in two consecutive sets
of doubles. Immediately afterwards
Spence repeated this feat against
Holland in the single. The follow-
ing day the boys journeyed to Dur-
ham where they met the fast Trin-
ity pair. Here in two close and
hard fought sets our couple de-
feated Cornwall and Shinn in dou-
bles. Then Hawkins beat Shinn
two out of three set in singles, and
Spence in his turn did likewise with .
ornwall.

Fellows, our team has beaten two
of the best teams in the state and
intend to give Elon a drubbing that
we can see next Wednesday. We
want this pair in Atlanta next
week, to enter the Southern meet.
We yet have a chance to reak ven-
gence on Tech, if we will only give
Spence and Hawkins a chance to
show them up. Tennis men, we
congratulate you on your victory,
and wish you the same success in
the future.

Miss Mary Lafferty and Miss
Hunt were among those who visited
Mooresville last week.

Miss Rosa Shumaker went to
Charlotte last week on business.
