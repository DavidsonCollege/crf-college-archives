One cannot dismiss these young
people with a shrug that it’s “too
bad” because these young people
will tomorrow decide the fate of
America. The way they think will
be the way America thinks. Their
failure will be America’s failure.

However, thank God, this picture
of America is not entirely gloonty.
Fortunately there is among those
applying for employment a very
considerable minority that whereas
they have many of the lacks of
the larger group such as readin’,
‘ritin’ and 'rithmetic, do, however,
possess manners, courtesy and evi-
dence to the personnel examiner
qualities of moral stamina, a will-
ingness for hard work and a sense
of personal responsibility. This
minority also appears to have ex-
perienced a moral and physical dis-
cipline entirely different from the
great majority.

Personnel departments through-
out the land became intrigued with
this minority because they realize
that leadership and executive ma-
terial must possess integrities of
discipline, mind and soul. Research
developed two facts: firet, that the
great majority of this minority
come from the small, liberal arts,
Christian colleges; and, second, that
the vast majority of the leaders in
American life have alway come
from euch colleges.

The magazine Good Housekeep- :

ing recently issued an annual re-
port of several pages concerning
these small colleges, more than 100
in number, each one of which en-
joys high academic standing and
was on the final accredited list of
the Association of American Uni-
versities.

This report proceeds to evi-
dence that one of the greatest
tributes that can be paid to the
soundness of the small, liberal |
arte, Christian college education
is the achievement of the peo-
ple whose names are enumerated
in a long list beginning with
Presidents Thomas Jefferson
and James Monroe down to the
present day. Included are the
names of the leaders in every
walk of life—educational, politi-
cal, business, scientific, judi-
cial, et cetera.

The graduates of the small col-
leges listed in the 1949 edition of
“Who's Who in America” out-
numbered the alumni listed of the
large universities in the proportion
of three to one.

Size and Religion

In view of these astonishing sta-
tistics one immediately - wonders
why it is that the vast majority of
leaders in American life have come
from small liberal arts, Christian
colleges. It cannot be because their
educational equipment is exception-

institutions have more money and
therefore greater facilities, more ex-
tensive curriculums, and pay more
money to their teaching staff.
America is finding out the sad fact,
however, that all these things do
not necessarily mean a better edu-
cated boy or girl. Research leads us
to believe that the supremacy of
the small, liberal arts, Christian’
college lies mainly in two things
—its smallness and its religious
basis.

There is so much to be learned
in college not contained in books.
The smallness of the liberal arts
college enables the student to be-
come better acquainted with the
instructor, The fewer students to
the professor, the more knowledge
and benefit to the student. The
small college gives to each of its
students an opportunity to come
into individual relationships with
unusually significant personalities
and get the benefit of their instruc-
tion, inspiration and association.
This is the most precious gifts these
institutions have to offer.

The Christian college does
not have a liberal arts course
that differs materially from that
in any other college. The dif-
ference is that. along with its
teaching, the Christian college
aims definitely at developing in
each student a Christian life
and character. Naturally, some
colleges are more Christian
than others, but all have the
same goal—the development of
intelligent, trained, all-around,
well-developed Christian leader-
ship. There is nothing of which
the nation stands in greater
need.

I like most of all this religious
influence that is thrown around the
students in these Christian colleges.
'Exclude religion from education,

no foundation upon which to build
moral character. Without religion
we cannot have morality; without
morality we cannot have social
safety; without social safety we can-
hot have civilization. It was a
businessman, James Hill, the great
builder of railroads, who said the
small Christian college is the hope
of America, Character is essential
to statesmanship and. these colleges
are vital factors in the development
of sterling character.

The members of the faculty of
these colleges are godly men and
women consecrated to their task of
creating Christian boys and girls
and educating them for the highest
type of citizenship, The students
must attend chapel which is at
least spiritual in character; the
Bible is taught in all of these col-
leges, and’ in many of them at least
one year of Bible study is required
of every student.

from the mint of the United States.
This coin has engraved upon it,
“In God We Trust’—the reason
being that our forefather founded
this country on God. They wanted
to worship God in their own way
and believed other men should have
the samegright, but they intended
that all citizens should worship God.

Most of our great state universi-
ties comprising hundreds of thou-
sands of youth of America have
no stich requirement. On the con-
trary, we find ourselves in the pe-
culiar position that through an ex-
traordinary tolerance and considera-
tion for all religions, God has been
ruled off the campus of our state
institutions. |

Without religion in education our
boys and girls will amount to little
in this world or the next. Educa-
tion is a flame when borne in the
hands of the faithful, but a fire-
brand when carried by the heretical.
Only by strengthening the Christian
colleges can America have the
leaders it needs to survive.

Kind of Leaders Needed

What kind of leaders does Ameri-
ca need? We need leaders in pub-
lic life religiously educated but
practically trained, good but not
dumb, honest but clever; Christian
leaders who have studied economics
as applied to human behavior and
consequently realize that the en-
slavement of a people when done
economically has the same results:
as though some tyrant had done it
physically.

Education Overhauled

We need leaders in our educa-
tional life to see that the educa-
tional system in our public ele-
mentary and high school institu-
tions is overhauled. Colleges have
been blamed too long for educa-
tional delinquencies that should
have been corrected in the grade
schools. Someone has well said
that we need leaders who believe
that an education should first of
all enable one to satisfactorily per-
form all the duties ofrlife, to be a
competent mother or father, main-
tain a home, do a job of work as
well as it can be done and. view
public affairs at least with com-
mon sense and exercise his fran-
chise to do something about them.

After all, the greatest purpose of.

education is to enable man to a
along with his fellowmen.

Student Body|Exemption Tests

Well-Varied

Business and medicine are the
most popular professions among the
student bady at Davidson College,
according to statistics released by
Registrar F. W. Hengeveld.

Almost 200 students are in-
terested in a business career,
while more than 135 are con-
templating careera in medicine.
The ministry and music were
also among the leaders in the
27 professions listed.

Some other interesting statistics
revealed in the report show a total
of 828 students registered at the
Presbyterian college from 25 states,
one territory and one foreign coun-
try. North Carolina is represented
by well over half, 457 of the stu-
dent body, with South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida and Virginia lead-
ing the’ out-of-state contingents.

Davidson has 16 religions
represented in the student body.
More than 450 of the students
are Presbyterian, with the
Methodist, Baptist, and Dutch
Reform faiths having the next
largest representations.

Largest class on the campus is
the freshman with 277 members,
followed by 211 sophomores, 180
juniors and 152 seniors.

self admitted, “Ours is a small na-
tion... one can see right

convinced that in this age when de-
ceit is apparently a virtue, and ig-
norance, the only sin, we have
necessarily chosen for our partner
one who will find it. hard to de-
ceive us, despite our ignorance.

Undoubtedly it will be good, and
perhaps it will be our salvation,
when a maturing America has shed
the swaddling clothes of inconsis-
tency and indecision, to have as a
friend, one who has openly stated,
“For good or bad we have taken
a stand... We don't want to be
pushed around!” around. ”

Sixty-three per cent of the 339,000 students who took
the Selective Service College Qualification Tests last spring and

summer made a score of 70 or

better, Major General Lewis B.

Hershey, Director of Selective Service, reported this week, and he

also reminded college students that
the deadline for submitting applica-
tions for the December 13, 1951 test
is approaching.

The new series of tests will be
given Thursday, December 13, 1951,
and Thursday, April 24, 1952, by |d
the Educational Testing Service of
Princeton, New Jersey, at more
than 1,000 different centers
throughout the United States and
its territories, The blanks may be
obtained by the registrant at any
local board office.

General Hershey stressed the
importance of all eligible stu-
dents taking the test, and indi-
cated that those who do not
have test score results in their
cover sheets may have a “very
difficult time indeed” in con-
vincing their local boards that
they should be deferred as stu-
dents. Application blanks for

‘the December 13, 1951, test
must be postmarked not later
than midnight, Monday, Nov.
5, 1951. Applications for the
April 24, 1952 test must be
postmarked not later than mid-
night, March 10, 1952.

To be ehgibie to apply for the
test, General Hershey pointed out,
a student must: (1) Intend to re-
quest deferement as a student (2)
be satisfactorily pursuing a full-
time college course; (3) must rot
previously have taken a Selective
Service College Qualification Test.

The criteria for deferment as a
student is either a satisfactory score
(70) on the Selective Service Col-
lege Qualification Test or satis-
factory rank in class (upper half
of the freshman class, upper two
thirds of the sophomore class, up-
per three fourths of the junior
class). Seniors accepted for admis-
sion to a.graduate school satisfy
the criteria if they stand in the
upper half of their classes, or make
a score of 75 or better on the test.
Students already enrolled in grad-
uate schools- may be deferred so
long as they remain in good stand-

ing. These criteria are guides and
the local board are not bound to
follow them,

General Hershey remarked that
when the Selective Service college
deferment plan was first announced
last spring objection was heard that
the plan gave preferred treatment
to the comparatively small number
of “bright boys” who could afford
to go to college. He said he be-
lieved that virtually all of the op-
position on this ground has been
dissipated, since there is now a gen-
eral understanding of the fact that
the purpose of the plan is to select
those most fitted to pursue college
educations and that a large propor-
tion of college students are “work-
ing their way through college,”
either partly or wholly. He cited
a recent survey made by the United
States Office of Education which
showed that fewer than 25 per cent
of college students are solely de-
pendent upon their parents.

AED Plans Trip
To Bowman-Gray

Today the Alpha Epsilon Delta
pre-medical fraternity sponsored a

trip to Bowman Grey Medical’

School in Winston-Salem, Approxi-
mately twenty-five boys left this
morning at 9:30 and returned this
afternoon at 5:30.

Attended Clinic

The pre-meds were the guests of
Dr. Parker Beamer, Director of
Admissions of Bowman Grey, and
of the graduates of Davidson who
are now attending medica! school
there. The group observed a regu-
lar day at medical school and also
attended a clinic staged for their
benefit.

For lunch the group split up and
ate at the boarding houses of the
two medical fraternities. The visit
proved very enlightening and in-
teresting for the future med-stu-
dents and acquainted them with the
life at medical school.

For Experience First

All the boys who went on the
trip were not necessarily applying
at Bowman Grey, but went along
primarily for the experience. This
and other programs that AED are
putting on are for the purpose uf
familiarizing the premedical student
with the life that he will face upon
graduating.
