THE DAVIDSONIAN

v

Davidson Arts

Artist Ce Scott Exhibit
Visually Challenges Viewers

By Sara Carlson
“Art needs to stimulate me

insome way,” CeScottbelieves.
“The stimulation does not nec-
essarily have to be pleasant for
me to respect the art.”

Scott’s three-dimensional
pieces now on display in the
Chambers Gallery challenge the
viewer to interact with and di-

_ gest.the work. She forces the
viewer to pause, lift a curtain,
bend down, read, and look twice
and a third time. It is impos-
sible simply to stroll through
this show; itdemands full atten-
tion.

Scott will perform in tan-
dem with her work in the Gal-
leryon Wednesday, at8 o’clock
in the evening. She plans to
speak informally about aspects
of her art following the perfor-
mance, —

“She’s dealing with
women’s issues that haven’t been
dealt with before,” local artist Laura

Well, one could say that I’ve
spent the last two weeks recover-
ing; rather than writing about it,
from the barrage of music that I
lived through during the month of
August.

Two festival tours recently
passed through the Southeast that
sent my brain spinning in a loop.
The H.O.R.D.E. Tour (Horizons
Of Rock Descending Eastward),
or Hippiepalooza as deemed by
Davidson alumnus’ Fudd
McKinney, stormed through. the
Southeast in early August with
dates in Atlanta on the 7th and
Charlotte on the 8th. In addition to
the H.O.R.D.E., the Lollapalooza

Grosch said. “‘She’s one of the

most brilliant artists I know.”
This mixed media collection show.

festival, created by former Jane’s
Addiction frontman Perry Farrell
last summer, made its second an-
nual swing through North Caro-
lina with stops in Raleigh on Au-
gust 18th and Charlotte on the 25th.
I was extremely psyched to see
both shows because of the vastly
different scenes at each.

The H.O.R.D.E. Tour was the
choice of the two for me, simply
because of the acts involved. The

tour brought together the likes of .
Blues Traveler, Spin Doctors, Bela ‘-

Fleck and the Flecktones, Col.
Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium
Rescue Unit, Widespread Panic,
and Phish. Unfortunately, Phish
played only in the Northeast por-

addresses issues of racism, sex-
ism, reproductive rights, and
beauty misconceptions. Her
last show, at the Christa Faut

‘Gallery in Davidson, prima-
rily confronted religiousissues.
Scott believes these difficult
issues are better addressed in
three-dimensions.
Each piece is complex, utiliz-
ing Scott’s experience in di-
verse media. Many of the as-
semblages include dolls, mir-
rors, fabrics, nails, and texts,
accentuating her background
in painting, drawing, jewelry
making, print-making, and fab-
rics. “People leave this show
affected. It seems as if the
work makes them think; itstuns
them,” gallery guard Carey
Morton said.
While the nature of her up-
coming performiance is under -
wraps, it promises to be just as

challenging and rewarding as the

tion of the tour, but they were re-
placed in the Southeast by Bela
Fleck.

‘ The show in Charlotte opened
with the Col. and the ARU. Their .
segment of the show featured the
customary amazing musicianship
of Jimmy Herring, JeffSipe,O’Teil

_ Burbridge and Matt Mundy, but

the impression laid outby the band_
was unfortunately lost in the poor
sound quality. Apparently, I later
discovered, the ARU was being
used. as the soundcheck for the
other bands in the show.

That could possibly explain
why I enjoyed the Spin Doctors as

The World According to Zappa

Hiya Shindiggers! This being
our first of a series of articles,
perhaps it will be helpful to briefly
introduce this column. Our goal is
to expand the horizons of the
Davidsonian , and consequently
your mind, at least musically. We

will vent our frustrations in a posi- ~

tive way, trying to expose you, the
reader, to:various types of “under-
ground” or otherwise little known
music. While neither of us claims
to have any formal musical knowl-
edge, we do know what we like.
_ We also know that music, espe-
cially crap like Slaughter and Ex-
treme, is not good just becayse
:John Boy or Billy says it is. How-
ever, this idea isa “two way street.”
Our approval of a group or album
does not imply social value or

worth. We are like Siskel and
Ebert in that we hardly ever agree
with each other, so how can we be
expected to agree with you? Our
purpose is to present different
music to a community which (in
the dormitories anyway) has be-
come horribly oversaturated with
the same old music being played

- over and over again.

This week’s installment will
focus on Frank Zappa. (Yes, the
guy who on Dack’s wall is pic-

_tured taking adump.) We’ve de-

cided to write about FZ because
he, as many others, often suffers
from problems resulting from
people’s perceptions of him. “He’s
a weirdo,” “He’s ugly,” “He’s too
liberal,” or just plain “He sucks”
are the most common responses to

the mention of his art. However,

not many people have heard any-
thing by Mr. Zappa, Esquire (ex-
cept possibly “Valley Girl”), so
how can people make these preju-
diced comments based totally on
hearsay. Afterall, he has released
more than sixty albums, mostly
rock but also including jazz and
classical works, since his first in
the mid-1960s. He has been re-
sponsible for a vast amount of
musical mastery through his own
work and by his launching of many
greatcareers. In addition, Frank is
funny guy, and many of his songs
are scathing insults directed at cor-
ruption in our society (usually poli-
ticians or televangelists). Finally,
