Drama Workshops Series

By WINDY MARCH
Staff Writer

“Accidental Judgements,
Casual | Sl4ughters,” a one-
act play written and directed
by junior Lee Fowlkes, was
presented Wednesday night
by the drama department,

Fowlkes has iad experience
in drama. He has, ‘for ex-
ample, taught a drama work-
shop. for high school

» students.

A previous play of his was
produced while he was in
high ‘school. ‘Accidental
Judgements,” he said, was
written last) year and = re-
written this year as part of
an independent tutorial
course in play-writing.

The play is a tragedy, with
three’ characters, set in a
men’s boarding school. Two
students, close friends,
played by George Graff and
Robert Banta... Dave Wells
did an excellent job as Mr.
Hoyt, the headmaster.

anfouncement, President
Charles E, Odegaard said he
based his present decision on
a thorough consideration of
gpinions he has received dur-
ing the past six months from
Students, faculty and staff.
Odegaard said that in these
responses there appears a
broad. consensus on two re-
durrent themes: the desire to

eep the ‘“Daily’’ on the
ampus as a ‘University aided
publication and the desire to

ee the ‘‘Daily’’ from the
ominant influence of any
me group or groups of indi-
Viduals.

“Experience of the past

read.

In other action, rising Sen
ator Robert Dawson announc-
ed that the Educational. Af-
fairs Committee has agreed
to allow the library to re-
main open until one or two
a.m.

Dawson stated that he had
spoken to Assistant Librari-
an Leland Parks who said
that the new policy would go
into effect as soon as provi-
sion had been made for a
janitor to work for one or
two extra hours.

were

‘

overabundance of scene
changes. The reason for this
might be that Fowlkes is
attempting to portray in one
act a long story which de
pends for its success on the
full development of three
characters.

Because of this, .develop-
ment of character and action
tend to be abrupt, through
nothing essential to charac-
terization is left out.

The sound sysiem was ef-
fectively .used to convey the
impression of a busy school,
including the voices of Mad-
len Marinaro and Bryan
Adrian.

This play was part of an
extensive. drama workshop
program sponsored by the
drama department this quar-
ter, including several plays
produced and _ directed by
students. Next week’s pro
ductions will be two one-act
plays by a young Polish
playwright, who, according
to Dr. Rupert Barber Ae

The’ two plays will be in
the Morrison Room Thurs

ed by George Draughon. will
star Bill Rolland, Jeff Lough-
ridge, and Gil Terriberry.
“Out at Sea,” directed by
Peter Lutken, will star Bill

Five Freshmen

Only five members of the
present freshman class. at
Davidson will not return here
next year, according to Dean
of Students-Wilt-H-Terry-:

“Five freshmen have talk

ring,’ said Terry ‘‘If* there

are any more I don't know

about them.”

Terry went on to say that
“two or. three’ freshmen
have left already this year.

This figure is balanced by
two freshmen who have come
to Davidson sincé the start
of the year--one at the be-
ginning of the winter term
and one at the start of, the,
