SLATER SYSTEM KITCHEN SCENE

Item 15: “standard watertight garbage cans’ ? ?

Slater Service Serves
Gross Health Violations

BY BILL FOSTER AND TOM LOFLIN

Every year the freshmen greet their first semester at Davidson with. howls of
anguish over the food served in the Student Union’s cafeteria by the Slater System.
Freshmen are required by the college to eat for the first semester with Slater: but

since most of them pledge fraternities and begin to eat at the houses the

second

semester, their cries soon are muffled by mouths stuffed with fraternity food.

Do the freshmen. really have
a complaint, at least as far as
sanitation in the college cafe
teria is concerned? ‘Tuesday
night at about 10 p.m., after the
Richmond ball game, THE DAV
IDSONIAN attempted to find out
by an investigation the
Slater kitchen.

Paul Black, the Slater snack
bar manager, halted the inves-

tigation after about ten minutes

by demanding that reporters and

photographer leave the kitchen. |

“You haven't got any business
back here,"’ he declared angri-
ly.

When reminded that the pub
lic had the right to inspect kit
chens of restaurants in _ this
state, he said, ‘‘Come back when
somebody is working back here.
You haven't got any business
back here when no one is
around.”’ Black was himself
‘around’ in the kitchen at the
time, fixing short orders.

But before Black halted the
inspection, reporters had man-
aged to inspect extensively:

In a drawer at the end of a
serving counter dead bugs were
found collecting.

A big roach crawled over a
vegetable peeler in the kitchen
before the eyes of reporters. The
device obviously had not been
cleaned for some time: a residue
of caked food had collected in it.

Two trays of cake had been
left out overnight. The cake was
completely exposed. Section 6,
Item 16 E2 of Laws, Rules, and
Regulations Governing the Sani-
tation of Restaurants and Other
Foodhandiing Establishments in
North Carolina states that “If
open dishes and pans containing
food are stacked, food shall be
protected with wax paper or
foil.”

Garbage cans both inside the
kitchen and outside the building
were not covered. This is a vio-
lation of Section 6, Item 15 of the
codes: “Garbage shall be col-
lected and stored in standard
watertight garbage cans provid-
ed with tight fitting lids so as to
exchide flies, rats, and ani-

Silverware had been left out
overnight on the serving line in

violation of Section 6, Item 14
of the code

A large crack was found in ihe
floor of the kitchen and was full
of mud and slime. This is a vio

lation of Section 6, Item 1 of the

code.

Reporters saw an individual
being served by Black .in the
kitchen. Food — establishments

which serve customers in the
kitchen violate Section 6, Item
16 E2 of the code.

Back in the storeroom, 2 large

can of shortening was left
covered in violation of Section
6, Item 12 of the code.

Despite the fact that report-
ers could find evidence of
flagrant violations of rules in
about ten minutes of investiga-
tion, the cafeteria received an
A rating during its last food
inspection in November.

THE DAVIDSONIAN has re
ceived many complaints from
freshmen who were required by
the administration to eat their
meals in the Union cafeteria
during their first semester here.
Some of these are as follows:

One found a dead roach under
a piece of cake he had been
served, and an upperclassman,
who used to eat in the cafeteria
of his own free will, found a bug
in his salad.

Another freshman saw a
roach crawling along the serv-
ing counter. A server also saw
the bug and exclaimed, ‘Look,
there goes a roach!"’ A cook
answered her, “‘Is that the
first roach you have ever
seen?”’

A freshman reports that he
has seen ants crawling over
tables in the cafeteria on
matiy occassions, and that he
found some chewing gum stuck
to his coffee cup. Another first-
year man told THE DAVIDSON.
IAN that he could not remem-

un

ber the time he had ever gotten

Trustees Review State

Oath Report Due From
Education Committee

The 48 Davidson trustees will gather this Wednesday
for the first of their two 1964 meetings. Probably the
most important consideration will be President D. Grier
Martin’s report on the state of the college. In this sum-
mary, which includes information from reports submitted
to him by all college departments and from his own
sources and observations, President Martin recommends
whatever measures he thinks necessary for the college.

of those coming or going have
not been released as of yet. It
is known, however, that Drs.
Earl MacCormac, T. O. Pinker-
ton and Max E. Polley will not
serve on the faculty next year.

Reports are to be given by the
four major trustee committees:
education, building and grounds,
finance, religious and social
life, church and alumni rela-
tionships. The three-man edu-
cation committee has been given
the problem of the faculty vow
and has worked extensively with
the faculty on this question.
They will meet Tuesday and
probably will make recommen-
dations to the general trustee
meeting Wednesday.

Hugh M. Cannon
Due Here Monday

Hugh M. Cannon, chairman of
the Department of Administra
tion of the State of North Caro
lina, will be on campus next |
Monday for speeches and con
ferences with students.

Also to be discussed by the
trustees will be a new state
ment of purpose of Davidson
College,.in the making for two
years by a joint faculty-trustee
committee, This statement
ready has been approved with
no dissenting votes by the facul
ty this fall.

A native of Lancaster, S. C., |
al Cannon was graduated from |
Davidson in 1953 where he re
ceived a Rhodes scholarship for
study in England. While at Dav
}idson he was president of the
| YMCA, and of Phi Gamma Delta |
social fraternity, a member of
Omicron Delta Kappa and Phi
Beta Kappa honorary fraterni
ties, and was selected for Who's
Who In American Colleges and
Universities.

A three-page report on the in
famous National Review survey
has been sent to the trustees by
President Martin. This matter
may also come up for discus
sion.

The trustees meet on Wednes-

Davidson, ‘‘Ranger’ Smith, has}
said on several occassions that

dence that they at times nibble
the food, left out unprotected at
night.

The fact that flies are not con
trolled by the Slater System in
the college cafeteria is no secret
to anvone who has ever walked
in the dining area for a snack
or a meal during the season for
those insects, Appearances are
that roaches and rats are not
controlled either.

The state code, and common
sense, demands control of such
dangerous pests.

Plans have now been drawn
to convert the dining area down-
stairs in the Union into a larger
and more convenient facility for
everyone. The area vacated by
the student store and game room
will allow the installation of a
new snack bar and the addition
of several private dining rooms, ;

The problems of the kitchen,
according to a statement made
to a reported by Dean Richard
C. Burts last semester, “‘have
been known to us (the college
officials) for about ten years.”

However, the administration
will more than likely continue
to require all summer school
students and first semester
freshmen to eat with Slater.

ODK To Distribute
Questions Monday

Members of Omicron Delta
Kappa leadership fraternity will
distribute personally to all the
members of the Senior Class
Monday night the recently com-
pleted questionnaire dealing with
the Davidson curriculum.
Seniors will have approximately
a week to complete this ques-
tionnaire and return it to the
member of ODK that gave it to
him.

As Joe Howell, chairman of
the Delta Circle of ODK, will
point out in chapel Monday, it
is hoped by the members of ODK
that this questionnaire will be
given ‘‘sincere thought. and con-
sideration” by each senior.

The results of this question
naire will be analyzed by the
student and faculty members of
ODK and will be presented to
the trustees later in the spring
in the form of definite recom-
mendations concerning the con-
tent and requirements of the
present Davidson curriculum.

fers from a lack of wildeat com
panionship. As a representative
of the Student Council, John
Spratt will discuss the problem
with head cheerleader Dan King.

Along a more serious vein
the Student Council in its Mon
day night meeting decided that
definite action must be taken on
those who evade library fines
by returning the books to the
shelves themselves and to those
that take books without check-
ing them out. This problem has
become worse with books re-
quired by large numbers of peo-
ple.

John Spratt, reporting on his
meeting with the Student-Facul
ty Conference Committee, in-
formed the Student Council that
next year, because of the rela-
tively low tuition, an additional
$15 per hour would be charged

of all upperclassmen taking
more than 16 semester hours,
with the exclusion of ROTC.

This change will be incorporated
on the pink cards next year. Also
announced was the Executive
Committee's consideration of a
new campusing policy.

The Student Council was in-
formed of the fact that the
Academic Scheduling Commit-
tee had worked a reading per-
jod into the future schedule.

the Freshman Council, the Stud-
ent Council decided to take a poll |
