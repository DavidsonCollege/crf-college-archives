__, With the end drawing near to
his first year as manager of the
Student Store, Peter Nicholls re-
viewed for THE DAVIDSONIAN
some of the additions and changes
that had been made in the store’s
operations.

The biggest change was the in-
corporation into one unit of the
previously-separated textbook and
Knovel Knook lines. Textbooks
‘are now available throughout the
year at regular store hours; earli-
er they could be bought easily
only at the beginning of the se-
mester during limited hours of

the day.
DISCOUNT

At the first of the school year,
‘students observed that the 10 per
‘cent discount they had received
earlier for textbooks no longer
existed. The student council at
one point studied the matter.

Nicholls explained that the dis-

count had been a two-year experi-
ment by the college.’ “The new
facilities present an extra cost to
the college. Now they have to light
the store, heat it, and staff it—
and my salary isa full time sal-
a

ry.

“With this in mind, they took
the 10 per cent off to see how it
would work out. There was noth-
ing definite about whether they
would or wouldn't go back.

ADJUSTMENT

“In July after the profits and
losses of the year have been de-
termined, they can decide wheth-
er they’ll be abie to make any ad-
justment in the sale of texts.”

Robert A. Currie, business
manager of the college, affirmed
the substance of Nicholls’ re-
marks. “We'd like for the student

general operations fund of the
college, rather than into the
scholarship fund as before. The
ambition of the college is to bal-
ance services to the students and
faculty with the costs of tnese
services, hoping the store can pay
its own way.
AUTONOMOUS

Nicholls is fairly autonomous in
his control of the store’s business.
Within reason, he says, “I can put
any mark-up I want on an item.
A lot of the items in the paper
section are marked lower than

. they would be in other schools.

* “This is a policy we’ve had here
for some time before I came, whiclr
I would not plan to change,” he
said. “Eventually we hope to get
lower prices on the necessities,
with a regular mark-up on luxury
items.”

The store served as host three
weeks ago to a Doubleday Faculty
Book Gair. “We had in 630 books.
66 were distributed to the facul-
ty and the faculty of North High.
We sold about 290, and we have

concurrently was a half-price sale
on selected Harper paperbacks.
“We had about 125-150 books

rt to pay less for books if the opera-
° tion makes that possible.”

He noted that in the last few
years, profits from the book
stores have been directed into the
-

left.”

Responding to the opinion of
motor bike owners who have
stated that motor bikes on the
Davidson campus proper would
not create a nuisance, the of-
fice of the Dean of Students has
‘announced changes in the cur-
tent policy of allowing no mot-
oreycies on campus.

Bob Jones, Assistant Dean of
Students, emphasizes that the
Traffic Committee is lifting the
restrictions on a trial basis only,
and that a decision will have
to be made with cegard to the
next academic year.

The bikes are now being kept
in Alex Bernhardt’s yard, and
it was Bersshardt who instigated
a movement in favor of the
policy change.

The statement of the Dean's
office is as follows:

The prohibition of motor bikes
is lifted for the remainder of
the current semester with the
following restrictions:

Why do riots rage in Lat-
in American student com-
munities? Why do Amer-
icans have such a poor im-
age south of the border?
What can be done to correct
this image?

These are ail questions which
nine students in the Project for
the Americas’ hope to answer
in their visit to Ecuador next
summer. They are scheduled to
leave June 10 for a two month
trip, travelling throughout the
country, and returning Aug. 10.

MIDDLE CLASS

Fred Ehlers, origmator and
leader of PRAM, outlined the
general purpose of the expedi-
tion during Wednesday night's
Open End. “We ate aiming.”
he said, “for the middle class
in Latin America. They have
had the least contact with pco-
ple from the Un%ed States."

He explained that the U. S.
Government has made contact
only with the upper crust of
Latin American societies, the
leaders. The Peace Corps is do-
ing a fine job, but only for the
lowest class. This leaves the
large middle class no means of
knowing the Unted States ex-
cept what they read and see,
ruch as the Selma crisis.

“Therefore.” continued Ehl-
ers, “‘we ate going to live en-
tirely within the middle class,
the students and small business-
men and their families.”

He pointed out that the riots
which spring up throughout
Latin America against the
United States are started by
and composed of middie class
people. “I have changed my
mind about the United States
since com:ng here and talking
and living with tsudents,” he
added.

STUDENTS

Ehlers then introduced the
party of students who are i
make the trip to Ecuador with
him this summer. They are B
A. Atken, Doug Pratt, Dav:
Walker, Glenn Withrow, anc
Erskine Sproul, all of Davidson
the four girls from schools ir
this area are Betty Craig and
Jan Galloway of Charlotte Col-
lege, Judy Learned of Queen:
College, and Diane Furr of Sa-
cred Heart.

questions, and the usual silence
passed, the forever volatile sub-
ject of ir¢egration arose. Danish
Richardson Scholar Kurt Ped-
erson asked why the group did
no: have a Negro.

Ehlers s:epped in to explain
that the students at J. C. Smith
had been invited to join and
were wanted very much, but
thal their minds were occupied
with the integration problem
in this country.

He added that the presence
of a Negro w:th the group would
have done a great deal of good.
since the’ only ones seen in
Latin America are e2ther enter-
‘ainers or athlezes.

INDIVIDUALS

Finally there was displayed
an inceresi in what the indi-
v.dual member of the Project
wished to get out of his trip.
Ine infamous avid Walker, re-
rowned for his actions in get-
tng to know people in Europe
and Canada, answered, “My in-

and a PhD from the University
Princeton Senrinary, cum laude
of Basel, magna cum laude.

Dr. Wayland J. Hayes has
been appointed Visiting Distin-
guished Professor of Sociology

for the first semester 1965-1966.

Tr. Hayes holds his BS de-
gree from the University of Vir-
gima, and his MG and PhD
from Columbia University. fle
has taught at Vanderbilt Uni-
versity since 1928 and is now
Professor Emeritus.

Dr. Hayes ‘s the author of
‘everal books and of numerous
articles and is 9 past president
of the Southern Sociological
Soicety.

Dr. Hayes will teach special
courses in Amer‘can Social Or-
gar2a.ions (Societogy 61) and
n Public Opinion (Sociology 62).

Members of the faculty who
will be returning in the coming
sear will include Dr. Francis

_ Ghigo and Dr. T. 0. Pinkerton

who accompanied the group of

‘students from Davidson par-

Ucipating in the Junior Year
Abroad program.
Dr. E. R. McCormac (piilo-

dents riot down there. What
kind of driving force do they
have that we do not?”

“T intend,” he continued, “‘to
meet these people wherever I

can, in taverns and eating
places."

In response to the same ques-
ton, Betty Craig answered, "I'd
like to find out the place of the
Lain American co-ed, what she
thinks and how she acts. What
does she want out of life."

DATING

A surprise question of the
evening, but not so much of one
when you look at who asked it,
came from Mackey MacDon-
ald, “Will you girls date the
Ecuadorian boys?”

Judy Learned answered, “I
don't see why not, if they ask
me." Ehlers interjected that the
customs in Latin America are,
of course, different, and that
the girls would probably only

might meet a boy at a party.
INTEGRATION

Paul Simpson brought the dis-
cusssion back to the integration
problem by asking the group
how they would answer ques-
tions about the racial strife.
Again Judy Learned answered,
“TI couldn't try to justify it, be-
cause I am ashamed of it. I'll
just have to admit it."

As the time approached for
the girls to leave for their
schools, Ehlers ended by say-
ing that PRAM is not going to
try to ‘‘sell the United States,
‘but to present a true picture."
The group is going to have to
admit both the good and the
bad about this country. It is
their job to get to know the
people with which they come
into contact.

In other business, Powell in-

Faulty Pay Telephones
Scheduled For Repair

Davidson's pay telephone pro-
blems should be pretty well
cleared up by May 3, according
to Harry Mann, district man-
ager of Southern Bell in Char-
lotte.

Additional equipment has
been ordered under a high pri-

ority heading to remedy the,

situation. The equipment to be
installed in ‘the switching cent-
ers will provide the addition-
al circuitry needed for proper
service.

This equipment according .o
Mann, which should be install-
ed and operation by May 3,
should remedy the inability to
get dial tones. It should also

clear up the complaints of lost | ;

dimes. Mann urges that anyone
still losing money or having any
other complaints notify the
phone company so the. specific
phone can be checked.

Asked about the poss:bility of
more phones for the dormitor-
ies, especially freshmaf dorms,
Mann said that additional
phones, which operate on 4
guaranteed return basis, would
have to be approved by the
school officials, as far as both

Field Will Present
Reading Of Poetry

Edward Field, winner of the
1962 Lamont Poetry Selection,
will appear tonight at 8 pm.
in the Morrison Room of the
Union.

Wield will read from his re-

discussion in an informal at-
mosphere.

The Academy of American
Poets presented their award to
Field ‘for the discovery and
encouragement of new poetic
genius.”

Critical comments on_ his
Poetry from 21 literary sources
reveal a varied range of re-
sponse from interested shock to
fervid excitement..

Said. Mark Van Doren, “Your
books is one of the best I have,
read in many years.”

William Carlos Williams com-
mented, “You gotta, to write
’em, have the words and you've
got ‘em. You. gotta have the
feeling among the words and
you got it... I'm certain
you’ve got the stuff: clean,
straight writing that knows (or
you know) what a poem could
be made of. I am much im-
pressed.”
