Court advisor: Students
will pay for damages and
are on social probation

By Matt GarFIELD
Managing Editor

The students who admitted to vandalizing
Patterson Court houses in February will pay
for damages and be placed on social proba-
tion. ;

Patterson Court Advisor Grahaeme Hesp

CoHo, and Rusk and

Warner Hall’s kitchen was broken into
twice, and the kitchen door was kicked open,
resulting in serious damage to the door.

CoHo’s kitchen was also vandalized,
though not to the extent of the other houses.

An investigation by sophomore Beau
Dasher ‘04, Patterson Court Council Ser-
geant-at-Arms, determined that the students
acted alone, rather than with the encourage-
ment of any houses. In light of the report,

. administrators decided not to press charges

against any house with which any of the
perpetrators were associated.
“We looked into a couple of situations, and

decided there was nothing there that tied it to _

any individual organizations,” said Hesp.

Floors and tables at Sig Ep were littered
with broken window glass and food, and the
new pool table was covered with canned
beans and feces on the morning of Feb. 14.

At Rusk, vandals covered floors and tables
with starch, syrup and cereal. Food was
dumped out on the floors, and the decorations
for Rusk’s semi-formal were damaged. Later
that weekend, 13 cases of beer were stolen
from a locked cabinet in another break-in.

PCC officials and school administrators
now have turned their attention to preventing
similar acts of vandalism from occurring
again.

“Tt may be that [vandalism] is a common
occurrence... but I don’t accept it as com-
monplace for students at Davidson College,”
said Vagt. “I’m not trying to make archangels
out of every student, but I do respect the
propriety of the ones we have here.”

Houses have begun locking their doors
more carefully, and PCC is considering
launching a program next spring to educate

new house members on community stan-
dards. But the best deterrent to vandalism,
said Hesp, is awareness.

“Obviously, it can happen again,” he said.
“I think if we all act as this community that we
profess we are, and let people know that
behavior like this won’t be tolerated, then it
shouldn’t happen again.

“We can’t be there 24 hours a day. That’s
where general community standards come
in.”

Asked whether publicizing the punishments
could serve as a deterrent to would-be van-
dals, Jeffries said: “I don’t really know
whether putting sanctions out there (in pub-
lic) would deter people. I don’t advocate
doing that from an administrative standpoint.”

Sig Ep President Jimmy Swansbrough,
whose house was damaged most severely,
said house presidents should take the lead in
educating members about proper behavior.

“As presidents, we should know the senti-
ments of our houses,” he said. “We’re in a
very precarious position in that we assume
liability for our houses. It starts with us.”

But in his view, students can’t do it alone.

“Treating others with civility has always
been a problem, especially when alcohol is
involved. PCC should be the first step in
changing that. The faculty and administra-
tion should play a large role as well. They
shouldn’t just leave it to the students. We try,
but we’re not completely mature yet.”
