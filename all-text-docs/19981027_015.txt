While the Wildcats football team
was trouncing Randolph-Macon, the
women’s soccer team was also putting
theirown memorable mark on the home-
coming weekend. The ‘Cats easily de-
feated Southern Conference rival East
Tennessee State University (5-11-1) 5
to 1, improving their overall record to 7
and 11 and an impressive 5 and 3 in the
conference.

Davidson dominated the match
from the outset, scoring their first goal

test. The goal was scored by Junior
Kelly Rennick. Rennick headed the
ball in the goal off a corner kick by
Junior Amy Balsinger. Davidson main-
tained its 1 to 0 lead until the 29:39
mark when Junior Ginny Dye scored on
an unassisted breakaway. Davidson led
2-0 at the half.

In the second period, Dye contin- *

ued her scoring attack with her second
goal of the game, 15 minutes into the
half. Dye leads the Wildcats with six
goals this season.

Not to be outdone by her team-
mates, Freshman Natalie Cox scored at
the 54 minute mark off an assist by

fellow freshman Carolyn Stumpf.

ETSU managed a goal nearly 74
minutes into the game, but the effort
was too little too late. Davidson’s ex-
cellent offensive production combined
with the solid play of Davidson goal
keepers, Chesley Garrett and Winnie
Corrigan, put the game out of reach for
ETSU. Corrigan and Garrett have split
goal tending responsibilities through-
out the season, and their statistics are
virtually identical. Garrett leads
Corrigan by seven in saves for the sea-
son, 65 to 58, while they have identical
goals against averages (2.33).

Also, sophomore -Carrié Porath
topped off the victory with the ‘Cats’
fifth goal of the game with less than a
minute remaining. The goal was
Porath’s second of the season.

Davidson's trouncing of ETSU
was exactly what the team needed after
suffering a heartbreaking 1-0 loss to
rival UNC Charlotte (10-5-1) last
Wednesday. The Wildcats fought
UNCC to ascoreless tie for over an hour
and Corrigan and Garrett combined for
nine crucial saves. However, at the 63:39
minute mark, Stephanie Bumier of
UNCC scored the game’s lone goal on
a one-on-one breakaway. The Wildcats
were outshot 8 to 0 and lost the game |
to 0.

The Wildcats last regular season
game is this Thursday, October 29th, at
4pm against UNC Asheville. The South-
ern Conference Tournament begins on
November 3rd, the time and place will
be announced in the near future.

crushed

their ri-

val with a potent blend of defensive
strength and offensive firepower. The
Wildcats outshot ASU 12-6 in the first

period en route to a shot advantage of
14-9 for the contest. Jennie Gold scored
twice for the ‘Cats on four shots, and
Lisa Holthaus scored on her only shot
of the game.

Though’.Davidson has only four

victories on the season, coach Jen °

Halliday feels confident as her team
prepares for the upcoming Deep South
tournament. Two of the team’s four
victories have come in the last two
weeks, with the ASU victory and a 1-0
win against Davis & Elkins; also, the
‘Deep South is familiar territory for the
‘Cats, who won the tournament six years
in arow from 1990-1996.

“Our transition is much better and
we're playing the entire field now,”
Halliday said. “We're peaking at the
right time.”

The tournament begins this Satur-
day, October 31st.

Entering into Belk Arena on the
afternoon of Sunday, October 25, one
couldn’t help but feel the excitement
over the match between the Appala-
chian State Mountaineers and the
Davidson Wildcats. The Wildcats and
the Mountaineers were the top teams in

tering the match, so both teams were
ready to vie for the top honors in the
conference. Belk Arena saw a great
number of Wildcat-fans in the stands,
from volleyball alumni to students.
Great vocal support for the Wildcat
cause came from the group of Davidson
hecklers in the front row, decked out in
various forms of headware from Viking
helmets to Waffle House caps.

The Wildcats walked onto the court
ready to play. In the first game they
scored early and often, throwing the
strong Mountaineer squad back on its
heels. The Wildcats made short work
of the first game, winning it 15-5.

The second game was a much

tougher endeavor for the Wildcats. The
Mountaineers swept out to an early 5-1
lead. Asthe game progressed the Moun-
taineers stretched their lead to 7-2, then
8-2, and finally 9-2: Wildcat Head
Coach Lisa Marston called a crucial
timeout. The Wildcats began an offen-
sive tear, scoring repeatedly while hold-
ing the Mountaineers scoreless. With
Ginny Quis serving the Wildcats tied
the game at 9-9. After a set of sideouts
the Wildcats took the lead with Mara
Mordini serving. A service ace by Gina
Lawrence later in the game extended
the Wildcat lead to 12-9. The Moun-
taineers were able to regain the serve
and get as close as 12-11 before the
Wildcats finished out the game at 15-
11. Second game comebacks have be-
come acommon theme for the Wildcats
this season. Many matches have turned
on the second game this year, and
Sunday’s match was no different.

’ The Mountaineers played well in
game three, but the Wildcats played

better. The Mountaineers took an early,

2-0 lead which the Wildcats quickly
stole, grabbing a 5-2 lead of their own.
The Mountaineers responded with some
aggressive play, retaking the lead at 6-
5. After a Sideout the Wildcats regained
the serve and eventually, the lead, on a

kill by Gina Lawrence. The Wildcats
would not relinquish the lead, winning
the match on an extended volley that
had the whole arena standing in amaze-
ment and apprehension. Game three,
and the match, ended at 15-7 in favor of
the Wildcats.

Head Coach Lisa Marston and her
team were happy after the win which
placed them alone in the top spot in the
Southern Conference. Coach Marston
said that her team “showed great com-
posure in winning the second game.”
She also said that “they were aggressive
when they needed to be and smart when
they needed to be.”

Several individual efforts led the
Wildcat attack. Brooke Bentley led the
team in kill percentage while she and
Mara Mordini each had 9 kills a piece.
Gina Lawrence had 8 kills and 5 blocks
in addition to her one service ace. Jen-
nifer Ortega, with 7 kills and 8 blocks,
had an all-around solid match. Janet
