COL. ADAMS PLANS
FLIGHT TRAINING

“T hope to get us a flight detachment,” stated Lt. Col.!
William L. Adams in an interview with Davidsonian re-|

porters. “We are on the approved list (for a detachment),
but we must see first what Congress does with our budget.
This training would be limited to seniors.”

Elaborating on this flight

plain that usually a man begins

something, is moved on, and it
is left for someone else to
finish the job.

Q. “What other plans do you
have for the future?”

A. “We want to go into the
battle group set-up. The regi-
ment is on its way out of the
Army. We want to align our
set-up with the Army's.” He
mentioned further that there
would probably be two BG's,
with companies as needed. Also,
the number of Cadet Colonels
would probably be increased
from one to three. '

The majority of those polled revealed that they
had dated for the week-end, although several in-
dicated they “wished they hadn’t.” 135 indicated that
they usually attend both the Friday and Saturday
night dances; however, the upper classes accounted
for most of the 32% who did not, with the Senior
Class going to the dances the least.

All the “benefits” of a dance week-end are not
free, however. Well over half of those polled in-

$100 Tuition Increase

‘For Professors’ Raise

By LAURENS WALKER
Davidsonian Managing Editor

By a unanimous vote Wednesday afternoon, the Board of Trustees increased
tuition for the College from $500 per year to $600 per year.

Funds resulting from this increase will be primarily used to raise faculty
salaries. The new salary schedule is printed on page two.

The Trustees, however, took
a long step to guarantee any
qualified student an education
at Davidson by increasing the
funds available for grants in aid
by $24,000 annually.

This brings the total money

available for scholarship aid ir contacted by the committee,

each year to $150,000.
RICHARDS APPROVES

J. McDowell Richards, Presi-
dent of the Board, stated after
the mecting that he “felt the
tuition increase to be a good
thing, in the light of the in-
crease in student aid.”

He continued. “No boy should
be barred from Davidson Col-
lege by finances.”

The Presidential Nomination
Committee reported to the
Board that they had no name to
present at this time. Dr.
Richards, when _ interviewed,
commented that the committee
was making definite progress,

Forum Announced .

Davidson’s YMCA _ has an-
nounced the inception of a pro-
fessor-student forum _ series
which will begin on March 2,
and continue to the end of the
semester.

Under the plan, Davidson pro-
fessors will conduct meetings in
their homes, discussing a wide
range of topics of local and in-
ternational importance.

The program, with sophomore
Jim Richards at the helm, will
be administered by a standing
committee of over 25 students.

Faculty members will discuss

“It is true that the weather

“Therefore, each eleven.

we have extreme weather.

“The atomic explosions have
no effect on the weather. The
only ‘possible relation weather-
men know of is that atomic ex-
plosions might introduce new
particles into the atmosphere to
serve as nuclei for raindrops,
hail, and snow. Otherwise, no
correlation has been discovered.

“An average increase in the
atmospheric temperature would
be disasterous, inasmuch as ice-
bergs would melt and the level
of oceans and seas would rise
and inundate coastal lands.”

He added, ‘For the long-range
thinker, the best real estate in-
vestments are’in the piedmont
and not the coast!”

and that he felt that the “Col-
lege would have a President by
mid-spring.
NO OFFICIAL CONTACT
“No one has yet been official-

though several men have been
unofficially sounded out as to
their possible feelings should
they be selected by the commit-
tee.”

Richards was asked what
seemed to be the major problem
in finding a suitable nominee.
“Thus far," he answered, “the
committee has not been able to
get together on a single name.’”

He' continued that both men

- men “not known at all” were

Cunningham some nine months
