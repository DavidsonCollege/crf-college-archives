Survey examines parallels

between race and major

How does diversity affect our academic experience?

By Ros HE prick
Staff Writer

Davidson is historically successful at keep-
ing certain institutional statistics low. GPAs are
one. The percentage of minority students on
campus is another.

For many it’s a perennial and frustrating
conclusion: Davidson lacks diversity, and in-
complete diversity means an incomplete col-

Out of 458 people in the graduating class of
2002, there were 69 minority students. Four
departments graduated no minority majors:
Classics, German, Philosophy, and Theatre.
Anthropology and Sociology had the high-
est percentage of minority graduates with
42.9 and 41.7 percent respectively. Minori-
tles made up less than 10 percent of the
graduates in English, the largest depart-
ment on campus. Data courtesy of Dr. Laura

lege experience. Many point out how the lack of
diversity on campus hinders our learning. And
yet how many ask how the diversity we do have
enhances it?

A survey recently conducted on campus in-
vestigated the intricacies of diversity, specifi-
cally with respect to majors. How does the
diversity of our institution reflect the diversity
across majors? Which majors are disadvan-
taged? And which are enriched?

The survey, which was distributed to ap-
proximately half of the student body by politi-
cal science professor Dr. Pat Sellers’s Pubic
Opinion class, included 52 questions on arange
of issues, including those concerning students’
race and their majors. When the survey data is
compared to similar data obtained from
Davidson’s Office of Institutional Research
regarding the class of 2002, certain patterns
emerge, perhaps hinting at a correlation be-
tween race and major.

Out of 458 people in the studuaiing class of
2002, there were 69 minority students. Four
departments graduated no minority majors:
Classics, German, Philosophy, and Theatre.
Anthropology and Sociology had the highest
percentage of minority graduates with 42.9 and
41.7 percent respectively. Minorities made up
less than 10 percent of the graduates in English,
the largest department on campus.

Looking at individual departments yields
interesting results. The philosophy department,
for example, graduated seven majors this
spring, all of them white males. The campus-
wide survey drew responses from five Philoso-
phy majors, all white. This congruity might
well.be attributed to coincidence, but the num-
bers become more interesting when compared

RLO clarifies housing lottery
rules at SGA meeting

Marsicano explains

current method

vs. ‘pure lottery’

By AMANDA PENNOCK
Senior Staff Writer

If you weren’t on campus last spring, or
simply didn’t hear the commotion, some of the
class of 2003 had a rude awakening when they
discovered that the allocation of Martin Court
apartments is not done by a “pure” lottery.

Due to an unclear explanation of the RLO
process, a number of rising seniors were not
given their top choice for housing in the Martin
Court apartments, more commonly known the
senior apartments, even though their lottery
numbers were high enough for this to happenin
a “pure” lottery.

However, RLO does not use a “pure” lottery
— that is, a lottery system that depends entirely
on the lottery numbers randomly assigned to
students. The senior apartments are assigned to
a “real-world atmosphere” — meaning that no
building on Martin Court may be mostly of a
single gender or mostly from a single Patterson
Court organization.

While variety takes top priority, RLO also
looks atthe “patterns of behavior’ of students in
assigning them to apartments. For example, if a
student has a record of dorm vandalism or
multiple noise violations, he or she would likely
not be placed in close proximity to a student
who has a history of noise complaints.

Senator Susanne Francis ’03, invited Dean
Leslie Marsicano and Leslie Urban to address

 theissues that were raised by student senators at

the Oct. 30 meeting.

Marsicano said that a new, clearer explana-
tion of the assignment rules and methods for
Martin Court had been created to clear up the

issues for the class of 2004. Marsicano and
Urban debated with students for much of the
meeting about the merits of having a “pure”
lottery versus the current method.

Marsicano explained that only about five
percent of students did not get their first apart-
ment choice due to behavioral patterns, which
was originally the main topic of concern for the
senators. Using this statistic, she explained that
switching to a “pure” lottery would make it
worse for the other 95 percent of students, and
that the people who would gain from this system
are those who cause the most trouble for RLO
