By MAIMORY BROWN
Earle Frazier truly brought his first
year of varsity track competition to
a climax in a blaze of glory by chalk-
ing up to his name two record runs
in the state meet at Chapel Hill Satur-
day. He, along with Miller Cochrane,
brought to Davidson three of the nine
state records that fell during the course
of this contest.

Frazier was-clocked in the mile
event -at 4 t 22 d
which is only 11 seconds above the
world mark for this race, Looks
as if Davidson will have a bright
Olympic prospect for 1936 in the
person of this ace sophomore dis-
tance runner. Under the careful
tutelage of Captain Pritchett, genial
Wildcat athletic director, this
trackster’s progress has been most
unusual, as can be seen by the con-
stant way in which he clipped time
off the school record in every race
he ran during the season just cul-
minated, and we have profound
confidence in the ability of ‘Coach
Pritchett and his assistants, feeling
sure that if the potentialities are
there, which certainly seems to be
the case, they will be used to make
this man one of the best distance
coursers in the nation.

The way in which Earle handled Mc-
Rae, Tar Heel star, and Byrd, Blue
Devil champion,, Saturday afternoon,
proved that real competition agrees
with him ideally. It is always more
to beat a man who is reputedly supe-
rior to yourself, and that is exactly
what this favorite of Felix has done.

His two-mile time established in
this state affair is one which should
stand for several seasons. Five sec-
onds is no mean slice to cut from
a record in any state, and partic-
ularly in North Carolina where
track teams have always been
above par and the records are all
good, The fact that Frazier was
able to travel this course in such
excellent time after having led a
fast field in the one-mile event is
all but miraculous.

Miller Cochrane also deserves plenty
of credit for his excellent putting of
the iron ball at the Tar Heel camp. At
the first of the season discus throwing
was apparently this man’s best event,
but when it becante evident that N. C.
State’s Primo Canera, Milan Zori,
couldn’t hold his distance down to less
than 150 feet in the steel plate event,
the Wildcat captain decided to set
things on fire with the shot; and that
he has done. The graduation of this
ian in Juné will leave an unusually
large gap in the Wildcat squad; one
for which there are no highly pros-
pective fillers at present.

The Wildcat nine seemed to be
entirely forsaken by Dame For-
tune during its season’s final cam-
paign with Wake Forest last Fri-
day and Saturday. The first game
was dropped in the eighth stanza
when the Deacons staged a three-
run rally, and the second saw the
Baptists trail until the final inning,
when they garnered enough scores
to win from the ’Cats, 11-10. These
encounters brought to a close what
might be termed a very disastrous
season, but the pitching of the Da-
vidson -outfit-was-sadly weak, and,
the loss of Captain “Shrimp” Mor-
ris proved to be a real backset.
Those of us who remember
“Shrimp” and the wonderful spirit
he displayed, not only on the ath-
letic field but in all phases of school
life, can readily understand why he
would have meant a great deal to-
ward the success of the baseball
team this year. An attitude like
his would give pep to any aggrega-
tion.

All of the sports have ended theiz
schedules, and it looks as if Felix and
I will have to sweep the sidewalk, roll
up the awning, and lock the safe until
next fall when we shall be back with
four well-manicured ‘claws and the’

Lead Batting Averages

Davidson brought a somewhat hectic
baseball season to a close last week,
losing to the Wake Forest Demon Dea-
cons on Friday and Saturday, The
scores in both games were close, but
the Deacons managed to eke out a vic-
tory in the first game, 5 to 3, and in
the second, 11 to 10. Davidson dropped
a game earlier in the week to N. C.
State, 22 to 10.

In the first Wake Forest game, Da-
vidson remained in the lead until the
seventh inning behind the masterful
pitching of Julian West. West, how-
ever, was removed from the game due
to a shoulder injury, and the Deacons
piled up three runs in the last’two in-
nings to take the contest. The sec-
ond game was also taken from the
Wildcats in the last inning when Wake
Forest used three hits and two free
passes to forge ahead.

Davidson has played sixteen college
games this season and hasbeen vic-
torious in but three. Two of these
games were taken from Duke and the
other from State. Other practice
games were played with teams from
neighboring communities,

The Wildcats opened the season with
Michigan State on March 26, losing to
the Spartans, 16 to 6. Since then they
have played Carolina three games,
State four, Duke four, and Wake For-
est four, A successful season wag pre-
dicted for Davidson because of the re-
turn of many players from last year’s
championship team, but the Wildcats
have fallen far short of living up to
these expectations. The team was dealt

Centennial Nine Closes
Season After Few Wins

Bringing a none too successful fresh-
man athletic year to a finish, the yearl-
ing baseball club concluded its season
with a record of four wins against ten
losses.

The baseball season was not eéntire-
ly without its rewards, however, . for
several promising stars were uncov-
ered, Quick, shortstop, and Dickson,
catcher, both as hitters and fielders,
have done well, and two pitchers,
“Lefty” Porter and Jack Somerville,
may make Coach “Red” Laird’s bur-
den lighter when he goes about build-
ing next year’s varsity baseball squad.

Other players deserving mention are
Corbin, .Gracey, Howard, and Ar-
rowood, Quick leads off in the list of-
Latting averages with an average of
452, and is followed by Corbin with
373, Dickson with .350, and Howard
and Arrowood with averages of .295
and .294, respectively. Shemwell, bring-
ing in 16 runs, scored most frequently,
and Dickson, gathering: 20 hits, led the
team in the hit column.

The Kittens’ batting average as a
whole is .211, which stands up favor-
ably compared to their fielding per-
formances. Too frequent errors marked
their games all season and prevented
the pitchers from making better rec-
ords.

Porter was the master in the hurl-
ing department, pitching half of the
team’s four victories. His greatest feat
was that of allowing Belmont Abbey
only three hits, a complete shutout
after the third inning. Gracey pitched

‘| the Wildkittens to another victory over

Belmont Abbey, and Somerville, pitch-
ing a win over Cornelius High, turned
in other performances which merited
more than the support given him in
the field. d

Teams defeated by the freshman
nine are Belmont Abbey (twice), New-
ton High School and Cornelius High
School. Individual batting averages for

Davidsonian’s Athletic Honor
Roll Selected For 1933-34

Mackorell, Frazier and Morgan
Most Outstanding Members
on List

Looking back over the 1933-34 ath-
letic year at Davidson, certain Wild-
cat reyresentatives stand out in our
minds as having done special service
toward the betterment of various team
records during the play of their sched-
ules. These men have been placed on
“The Davidsonian’s” roll of honor for
sports, and their names appear in the
box above this column,

Last season’s gridiron record was one
of the best inm-many years at) David-
son, and during the campaign of this
football aggregation many stars were
revealed, but five men, in our opinion,
showed the most consistently good
work for the entire season. Such stal-
warts as Perey McElrath, Julian West,
“Tubby” Hand, A, J. Potter, Jim Mor-
gan, and Brewster Grant deserve men-
tion for their service, but those chosen
for particular honor are: Johnny Mack-
orell, unanimous choice for the myth-
ical all-state teams, and mentioned for
a backfield position on the all-American
eleven; Charlie Rives, captain of the
33 outfit and a member of some all-
state selections; “Schnozz” Willson,
winner of the Tim Pharr blocker’s
medal; Joe Wingfield, leather-lugger
superb, and alternate captain of the
‘34 team, and Dewey Hutchins, also
alternate-captain of next fall’s squad.

Courtney Ross leads the basketball
list by virtue of his high scoring hon-
Charlie Harris wins a position for
his excellent performance all season on
the hardwood, and Mack Holland, win-
ner of the team spirit trophy, gets the
other selection from Davidson's Wild-
cat five. Jim Morgan showed excel-
lent form at times during the cage sea-
son, as well as John Lafferty and Coley
Windham,

Earle takes the forefront
among the track stars, with a season’s
record filled with too many unusual
performances to mention; Miller Coch-
rane, captain of the ’Cat tracksters,
takes second place in this sport, with
John Lee, Ras Evans and Fred Mce-
Phail occupying the other berths.

The baseball aggregation contributes
Jack Jenkins, sophomore pitcher;
Frank Mock, captain; Jim Morgan,
star outfielder, earning his third letter
of the school year in this sport, and
Julian West, moundsman. Fred Smyre,
Teal Rogers, Woody Burns and Johnny
Mackorell are in line for mention as
outstanding members this year's
nine. t

In the minor sports, Jimmy Halver-
stadt looms brightest with the state
singles tennis title to his credit. Johnny
Lafferty, who went to the doubles
finals with the Davidson No. 1 racquet-
wielder in the state toruney, also gets
a position on the roll.

‘Cat Place Third
At Chapel Hill. As
Many Records Fall

Nine State Marks Are Broken in
Meet, Three by Davidson
Men

FRAZIER IS STAR

Cochrane Breaks Shotput Rec-
ord; Carolina Wins

The Davidson Wildcat trackmen cul-
minated their 1934 season last Satur-
day by taking third place in the state
intercollegiate track meet, which was
held at Chapel Hill.

Three out of the nine state records
established during the meet fell to the
Wildcats, Earle Frazier won the mile
casily to set a new state record of 4
minutes and 22 seconds, and later ran
the two-mile event in 9 minutes and
43.1 seconds, to clip 5.3 seconds off of
the old mark. Miller Cochrane heaved
the shot 46 feet and 3-8 of an inch to
cop another state record for the ‘Cats.

Cochrane also*took third place in the
discus throw. Ras Evans of Davidson
placed second in the 220-yard dash and
third in the 100-yard dash. Gammon
took second in the high jump and Mc-
Phail cleared the 120 and 220-yard
hurdles to take fourth place in each
event. Oakes of Davidson placed third
in the half-mile, while Lee fied with
two Carolina’ men for second place in
the pole vault.
