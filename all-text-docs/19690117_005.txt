Signatures And Letters

If you have ever arrived early at a Davidson basket-
ball game to watch the freshman team destroying
Gaston College or some other local powerhouse, you
may have noticed the crowd at one end of the court.
where the varsity players sit before going in the lock-
er room to be taped. The crowd consists mostly of
sons and daughters of long-time Davidson fans who
come early to get our autographs, talk to us, see if
we are real, or just gawk at us.

Now some of this column may sound conceited or
chauvinistic, but justifiably or not, the Davidson bas-
ketball players (especially those who start) are idolized
by many a school-aged tyke. Besides the autograph
hounds that meet the players during the freshman
games, certain players (mostly the handsome ones)
receive a good amount of fan mail.

Because of our number four rating nationally, the
starters and even some of the other players are recog
nized in public. At certain times this could tend to be
disastrous. Still in this world of numbers and IBM
cards, it’s ego-elating to have someone know your
name. It tends to make three years on the bench
worth it.

I've always wondered what the people who do bother
to get our autographs do with them. Although many of
scribbled-on programs probably end up under the
broom of a coliseum janitor, I'm sure some of our
names are put carefully away in some drawer to re-
appear later as a flaunt in the faces of the neighborhood
gang. I can just see the face of some young fan
when he gets older and finds a previously treasured
program when cleaning out an old chest. He'll prob-
ably laugh and think, “And who was Rock Crosswhite?”

The girls are really the most interesting to listen
to when they ask you to write your name. A 12 or
13 year old girl will come up to you all the time brush-
ing her hair in place with her.free hand, and hand you
something to autograph. This will be anything from
the back of the ticket stub to an autograph book to a
stuffed animal. I remember once autographing a
stuffed dinosaur which must have weighed 20 pounds.
The bright-eyed girl clutching it couldn’t have weighed
too much more.

Several of the older girls will be a little more bold
and ask you to write some cliche and sign your name
to it. You may ask Wayne Huckel about certain high
school sophomores who get carried away and kiss him
after he signs their book.

Fan mail really creates the most humor. Obviously
the starters get most of this attention. Davidson, being
a one post-office town, makes it easy for letters to find
their way to the players. A simple name and Davidson.
N. C., gets the cherished letter to someone's idol.

Again the letters come mostly from girls in their
early teens. Huckel and Jerry Kroll probably receive
the greater part of these. The girls usually want to
know what players are interested in and mainly, if
they have a girlfriend and what she looks like.

Huckel received a letter last year from a girl in
Greensboro who said she was 19 years old and single.
The letter included the girl’s measurements, her ad-
dress, and a picture, which looked strangely like a
current movie star. You'll have to ask Wayne if he
ever answered that note.

Mike Maloy gets a good deal of mail from 15 and 17
year old girls. Being in the national spotlight as an
All-American candidate, he has received fan letters
from across the nation. A girl in Detroit wanted to see
him after the Michigan game.

Doug Cook and Mike O'Neill get their share also.
One girl wrote to Doug and told him that she was do-
ing a school report on basketball and wanted some
information. She included a self-addressed stamped
envelope for a return.

Dave Moser received a letter last year from some
little boy who included a crayon drawing of Dave
dribbling a basketball. It was really fairly good and
Dave put it on his bulletin board.

Occasionally the skins (substitutes) get fan mail but
ironically, most of these letters ask questions about
the starters. Fox DeMoisey received a note from some
girl who wanted to know if Kroll had a girlfriend be
cause he was her favorite, or if Huckel had a girl be-
cause her girl friend liked Wayne. Fox has received
a number of heartbreakers but -he takes them stride.

The rest of us receive notes at certain times. Usually
these come from boys writing letters for a seventh
grade English assignment or something else. But
every once in awhile some thoughtful girl or boy will
write us as if we were playing.

Two weeks ago, a 12 year-old girl wrote me saying
that her father told her he was a skin when he played
at Davidson, She said if I was a skin like her father
then 1 was her favorite player. It made my whole

day.

Taylor’s 84 points paced a

he hit on 34 of 44 from the
field and 16 of 18 from the

VMI and William and Mary.

This year's team draws
heavily on the underclass
men on the team, as all but
two members of the start-
ing team are sophomores.

The flu has kept several
men at less than top condi-
tion and necessitated a for-
feit against the Wolfpack.
Among those out with the
flu is Coach Charles Parker.

An additional problem ham-
pering the 15 man squad is
the lack of size and weight.
Senior Kerry Keith, at only
190 pounds. has been forced
to face opponents outweigh
ing him 40 pounds in the un-
limited class.

In addition every team
member is wrestling one
weight class higher than he
should, resulting in weight
disadvantages.

The bright spot of the team
so far has been sophomore
Jack Jacobs. He won the
only points in Davidson's
32-3 loss to William and Mary
and has been impressive in
the other two matches.

In the Keydet match Frank
Rader, at 177, led the Wild-
eats with a pin. 123-pounder
Art Cromartie won a decision
and Ron Williams gained a
tie in his match in the 26-10
