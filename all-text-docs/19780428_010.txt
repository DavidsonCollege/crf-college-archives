Cat pride spurs comebacks

By MIKE LINS
Staff Writer

Two last inning rallies
brought new life into the Wild-
cat baseball team this past week
as the two comebacks led to two
very important victories over
The Citadel and James Madison
University. The two victories
demonstrate the team’s efforts
to salvage what has been a
somewhat disappointing season
for the Cats (the Cats are now
14-23 overall).

The first victory came in the
first game of a double-header
against The Citadel, who was in
third place in the Southern
Conference prior to this week-
end. The Citadel led 2-0 for
most of the seven-inning game,
since the Cat hitters could not
crack the strong Bulldog de-
fense. Junior Ron Cannon
pitched for the Cats and held
the Bulldogs to only two runs.

The Cats finally got the
breaks: they needed in the
seventh when a hit, a walk, and
then a crucial error by The
Citadel shortstop loaded the
bases for the Cats. This brought

the Cats’ leadoff hitter Tim
McDowell to the plate with two
outs.

Tension mounted as the out-
come of the game rested on one
man’s hitting ability. The
weight of the situation could
not have been carried by a more
versatile hitter since McDowell
rocked smoothly into a waist-
high fastball, smashing the ball
out of the park and leading to a
stunning 4-2 victory for the
Cats. The Bulldogs then
bounced back to defeat the Cats
5-4 in a hard-fought second
game.

The Cats’ 4-6 Conference
record prevents any likelihood
that they will contend for the
Conference title this year. How-
ever, their victory over Citadel
marks a decisively important
victory, since it moves arch-ri-
val Citadel beyond any possibil-
ity of winning the title either.

The other big victory this
week came in the second game
of a double-header against
James Madison University.
Earlier in the season, the Dukes

they also won the first game of
the home double-header against
the Cats. So the Cats felt they
had a score to settle by beating
the Dukes.

The hard-fought game pro-

entered the seventh inning with
Madison ahead 5-3. The Cats
then loaded the bases with one
out, bringing power hitter Stan
Brown to the plate. Brown
smashed a long fly ball to
centerfield, where _it was
caught, but only after scoring

one run and moving
5-4. Then freshman shortstop
Cam Zurbruegg came to the
plate and smacked a two-run
double which won the game for
the Cats. Junior pitcher Ken
Norwood got credit for the win
for the Cats.

Cattes capture fourth place,

By LISA JOHNSON

With a sigh of relief and
stomachs which looked as if
they had eaten three cans of
tennis balls each, the girl’s
tennis team returned to David-
son after an eventful weekend of
tennis. Their spring season was
finalized by capturing fourth
place in the Small College
Division II State Tournament
held April 20-23 in High Point
and sponsored by the home
team, High Point College.

Individually the girls did well
and the final scores were excep-
tionally close. Kirk Cameron,
playing number one for the
Cattes, lost in the finals to Vicki
Williams of High Point College.

Hope McArn managed to
gloriously defeat all of her
opponents and win the number
two singles position.

Anne Stanback received a
tough draw and was overcome
in the first round by the top
seed for the number three spot,
Marie Reilly, also of High Point
College. But Stanback made a
strong comeback and won her
consolation division.

Mary ‘‘Ugly”’ Gilliam and
Nancy Brown, playing at the
fourth and fifth positions, both
advanced to the semi-finals

before being defeated,

Andrea Murphy lost in the
first round to the girl who
eventually won the number six
singles, but Murphy also won in
consolations.

The singles competition was
vigorous, but with two players
in the finals, two in the semi-fi-
nals and two winning consol-
ations, Davidson fared well.

Cameron and McArn were
conquered in the doubles finals
by the number one girls from
High Point. Gilliam and Brown

were also defeated in the finals’

by Crawford and Finn of Meth-
odist College. The number three

doubles, Grace Morgan and
Anne Stanback advanced to the
semi-finals before being over-
come.

Davidson placed fourth in the
tournament, behind High
Point, Methodist College and
Guilford College, but the girls
were only one point behind
second place Methodist and a
mere one-half point behind
Guilford, indicating the intense
closeness of the tournament.

Their season ended at 8-6,
and the girls wish the Varsity
boys much luck this weekend at
Furman in the Conference tour-
nament.

3 more cagers sign

By EMIL PARKER
Sports Information Director
Davidson College is enjoying

a good recruiting year in bas-
ketball and the Wildcats’ three
latest signees--Eric Sorensen,
Greg Berlacher and Brian
Rowan--all have a lot in com-
mon.

Sorensen is a 6-6, 205-pound
swingman from Peters Town-
ship High School in McMurray,
Pa.; Berlacher, a 6-4 guard from
St. John’s High School, in
Toledo, Ohio; and Rowan, a 6-7
forward from St. Francis High

School in Toledo.

All three have signed national
letters of intent with new
Davidson coach Eddie Bieden-
bach, joining previously an-
nounced 6-9 Jamie Hall from
Penn Hills High School in
Pittsburgh.

Outstanding basketball skill
is not their only common cha-
racteristic. All three are doc-
tor’s sons and have expressed
interest in pre-Med majors.
Berlacher’s father, Dr. Franz J.
Berlacher, is a cardiologist in
Toledo. Rowan’s father, Dr.
Charles E. Rowan, is a general
practitioner in Toledo. And
Sorensen’s father is a dermato-
logist in McMurray.

““‘We think these are three
good players and all of them can
make strong contributions to
our program,”’ Biedenbach said.

“‘Berlacher is very sound
offensively and defensively. He
could be a help to us right away.
Rowan is a quick forward who
can run and jump. He will give
an added dimension of quick-
ness and speed. Sorensen is a
very dedicated player who is
also strong, a good shooter and
handles the ball very well.’’

Berlacher averaged 16.5
points and led St. John’s in
steals as a senior, earning
all-city and all-state honors in
the process.

Rowan was also an all-city
and all-state selection as he
averaged 15 points, 12 rebounds
and made 57 percent of his field
goal attempts.

Sorensen, who played in the
Dapper Dan Classic at Pitts--
burgh averaged 18 points and
13 rebounds for Peters Town-

ship High.
