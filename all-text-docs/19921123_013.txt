Zimmerman:

This Time it 1s
a 'Good' Album

By Wyman Rembert
Nota ‘Hot Item’ is what they
said at the Central South Blvd

Camelot Music store. They have3 ,

left of the 8 they got originally.
The Pineville-Matthews Camelot
has sold out of all 1 copies they
have gotten each week for the past
two weeks. It entered at #51 on the
Billboard charts for the week end-
ing November 21st. But, fear not,
some people have good music taste.
The Camelot ‘superstore’ on East

Independence has sold all 50 cop- :

ies each Friday for the past two
weeks.

What are you talking about,
you ask. Well, Bob Dylan’s (aka
Robert Zimmerman) new disc,
Good As I Been To You, of course.
Itsure ain’t Bon Jovi’s new album.
They’re nice and have mass ap-
peal, but I think I outgrew them
when I was 15 or 16. [hope I never
outgrow Bob. It’s kind of like
Simon and Garfunkel; I can see

myself listening to.their music 30~

years from now in my Lay-Z-Boy
with my cardigan, my bald spot,
and my pipe.

His music doesn’t have the
mass appeal that Bon Jovi or Ma-
donna have, so I doubt many of
you will rush out and buy this disc
as I did. I hope that if you are not
already a fan of his, that you will at
least take the time to listen to some
of the album if. friend says that he
or she has it. Who knows, you may
find that you like it. What can I say
to make you buy it, or at least listen

to it? Come on, man, try it. It’s

.good for you. No, really.

If you’ ve ever felt moved by
some poem or short story in one of
your English classes, high school
or college, then chances are you

Madonna’s new book, with
. the subtle title of Sex, caused quite
astir in many circles when ithit the
book market in October. The book
will not offend you if you are into
orgies, homosexuality, menage a
trois, bondage, beastiality, and ex-
plicit sexual language. The book
looks like a spiral binder with a
metal cover and back piece. In the
book, there are pictures galore, that
do not leave much to the imagina-
tion, and some spell-binding, inge-
nious, and thoughtful narrative. The
pictures explore many of the realms
of sexuality, including homosexu-
ality, and orgies, etc. The book
also sold out remarkably quickly,

are the type of person who has a
good chance of being moved by
Bob Dylan’s music. Maybe this
isn’t the right album to start off
with, but you gotta start some-

‘where.

After seeing him sing on TV
a few times in the past few years
and seeing him in concert in Char-
lotte two years ago I was skeptical.
If you keep up with him you know
what I mean. The mancan mumble
with the best of them. I was only
able to understand some of what he
was singing/mumbling when I saw
him in concert because I was fa-
miliar with the songs. With songs
one has never heard, who knows
what to expect.

I figured I would be lucky to
catch even half of what he was
saying on this new disc. Happy!
Happy! Joy! Joy! I was pleasantly
surprised to find that I could make
out almost all of his lyrics on this
new disc. Only a few lyrics are

indiscernable. Part of thisis.dueto .

the fact that it is entirely an acous-
tic album. No backup singers. No
drums. Nothin’ fancy. Just Bob,
his guitar, and sometimes his har-
monica. Just good acoustic music.
If you’ve seen Miles Mowry
play at the Commons, the 900
Room, or the Outpost recently and
found that you like acoustic music,
then I think you’lllike Bob Dylan’s
new album. Granted, his voice
doesn’t sound as good as it has on
most of his past discs, but hey, the

guy’s getting old. He must be at =¥,

least Fifty by now!

Pete Hamill said “Dylan’s art
feels, and invites us to join him” in
a review of Dylan’s 1974 album,

(especially with its extremely ex-
pensive price tag) and a second
printing is not going to be offered
due to the expense of the “tamper-
proof” packaging. After person-
ally viewing the book, primarily
negative thoughts came to my
mind, and I see several issues at
hand here.

First of all, is Sex art? This
“art” issue has always plagued’me
about many pieces of alternative
art, which is, I guess, is politically
correct term to use. If the photos in
Sex are art, then any type of por-
nography is art. I do not see this
book as art, in any form, and ifitis,

O woe is me! After many
months of looking forward to see-
ing Francis Ford Coppola’s adap-
tation of Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel
Dracula, I, having been teased by
those tantalizing trailers, came
away from the opening night of the

' film more than alittle disappointed.

Touted as one of the highlights of
the winter movie season, I think
that perhaps this “cinematic
extravanganza” was doomed by
the hype surrounding it from-the
beginning; but then again, why
shouldn’t we expect something
great from the director of “The
Godfather” trilogy and a cast that
boasts such talent as Anthony
Hopkins and Winona Ryder? This
flick should’ ve had sparks flying
out of the screen and stuff. You
will see great special effects, but I
think just a little too much of the
$42 million spent on the project
went for razzle dazzle and not
enough went towards a script that
would do justice to Stoker’s novel.

The film opens with a histori-
cal background on the mortal
Dracula (Gary Oldman) who re-

as

,, Hype of Dracula

turns from a battle in 1462 to find
that his beloved bride has died.
Upon hearing this he beats upsome
priests, trashes his chapel, and re-
nounces God (We are supposed to
believe that this is why he turned
into a vampire, which just goes to
show you: Don’t get on God’s bad
side).

« Flash forward 400 years to
London where we see a young law
clerk by the name of Jonathan
Harker (Keanu Reeves) preparing
to go to Transylvania to settle a
real estate transaction with a spe-
cial client. Guess who? Anyway,
Harker goes to Dracula’s castle,
way up in the dark, dank, moist-
strewn Carpathian mountains, with
danger lurking ‘round every cor-
ner. Ooh, it was just too spooky for
words.

_ Harker finds that his host is
more than justa little weird and his
castle is hiding several interesting
little secrets (like Dracula’s harem
of beguiling blood-sucking beau-
ties). Unfortunately for Jonathan,
he gets all in the Count’s Kool-Aid
and doesn’t even know the flavor
(translation: the boy was in

=-Ruins the Movie

Dracula’s business), so he is “de-
tained” by a beauty at the castle
while Dracula heads off for Lon-

‘don to find his dead bride who he

believes has been reincarnated in
Harker’s fiancee, Mina (Winona
Ryder).

Iread the book three times and
thought that I was frustrated and
disappointed over the film. I’ve
come to realize that anyone with
half a brain should be able to see
that beneath the glitter surround-
ing Dracula, there is no gold.
Reeves was miscast in his role as
the Englishman, Harker, and every
time he spoke it seemed almost
comical. It was obvious that he
wasn’t just struggling with the
English accent, but the partas well.
I kept expecting him to say, “Yes
way, Ted!” or something like that

Ryder also seemed uncomfort-
able in her role, but she is more
professional and more talented than
Keanu soshe managed to pull it off
better. Iwas much more impressed
with newcomer Sadie Frost’s per-
formance as Mina’s flirty friend
