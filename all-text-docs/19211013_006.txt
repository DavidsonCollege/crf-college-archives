TO GEOLOGY STUDENTS.

Dr. William A. Price, 1909, was on the}
hill for a few days last’ week. While|
here he lectured to the class in Geology |
on the importance of the study. After
his graduation here in 1909, Dr. Price)
went to Johns Hopkins where he re-|
ceived his Ph.D. degree in Geology in|
1413. He was then Professor of Geology |
in the University of West Virginia, un- |
til the late war. During the war he|
worked under the direction of the |
Bureau of Mines in manufacturing muni-
tions until June 12, 1918, Then he enlist-
ed in the army as a private. He was dis-
charged on December 11, 1918. He is
now a first lieutenant in the Reserve
Corps. Late in the summer of 1918, Gen-
eral Pershing called for six geologists
and Dr. Price was one of those called
but the armistice came before the ar-
rangements were made for his transfer.
Dr. Price is now doing exploration work
for the Standard Oil Company in Mex-

MR. JOHN McINTIRE, '94, PASSES TO
GREAT BEYOND.

A recent death of interest to the
Alumni is that of John McIntire of the
cJass of 1894. He is remembered by his
college mates for his unusual wit and
popularity. His Junior oration was a
masterpiece of oratory and gained him
“much distinction at the time. For the
past 11 years Mr. McIntire was division
sales manager for the state of North
Carolina, of the American Multigraph
Sales Co. He made a splendid success
in this business and was very highly
thought of by the officers and men of
the company. Two years ago, this
October, he married a western girl, Miss
Maude Camp, of Indianapolis. About
a year ago he was operated on for gall

stones.. His sickness continued and
developed into form of progressive
paralysis. Last January his relatives

brought him to his home in Wilmington,
N. C., hoping that the change in climate
and proximity to his family and old
friends might be beneficial. His case
however was hopeless and the best his
relatives could hope for was to make his
passing as easy as possible. He was told
by his family physician an old David-
son class mate, Dr. Andrew Harris, that
he could not recover but he still fought
and would not give up.

However, the grim reaper came at last
and John McIntire was called away to
a greater life above.

He was a member of the Kappa Alpha
fraternity, was affiliated with the ma-
sons, and was an ardent and active
rotarian. -In Indianapolis he was on the
Rotary Entertainment Committee and
had previously been president of the Dal-

Columbia Seminary this year. He will | ties for told-timers to get together and}

evening of enjoyable entertainment for|
a large audience of students and towns-|
people, |

Eustace, who Sir Edward Pelham, a|
rich mining capitalist, has selected as|
a husband for his daughter Nadine goes
with them from England to America on|
a mining trip. |

Out in Nevada, Nadine meets Mayard}
Delaval and falls in love with him. One}
afternoon while they are out riding Na-|
dine is snake-bitten, Delaval admin-|
isters the first aid remedy to her. When
they do not return to the hotel Sir Ed-
ward and Eustace go to seek them. They
are found in a cottage to which Delaval
Because of a misunder-|
standing Sir Edward tells Delaval to}
take his daughter in marriage and, with-
out waiting for an explanation, he and
Eustace immediately leave for Canada.

Delaval and Nadine are married. The
next morning Nadine has only a faint
recollection of the events of the preceed-
ing night. Because of her seemingly
cool indifference ‘towards Delaval, he
secures a divorce.

Nadine goes to Washington, where
Mr. Hopper, a millionaire, falls in love
with her. Her father comes to Wash-
ington and finds her there. Wishing to
prevent her marriage to Hopper he
wires for Delaval to come, who arrives
the day before she is to marry Hopper.
She finally decides that Delaval is her
true “knight” and, to the satisfaction of
all except Hopper, marries him.

Music furnished by Buchanan, Hol-
lingSworth, Steele, and Northrop added
greatly to the program.

Because of the football game in Char-
lotte next Saturday a picture will very
likely be shown on Friday night.
