Freshmen are to wear Fresh caps at all

|form of athletics (golf excepted), or
| when wearing an R. O. T. C. uniform;
|they shall be required to learn college
jyells and songs and to sit in a body at
athletic games (unless with guests); and
they shall not make themselves con-
spicious by giving yells for their class
or by painting their numerals about the
;|campus or town. It is also understood
|that the age-old tradition of Freshman
|meekness is not to be broken by any
member of this particular class.

The Vigilance Committee members
have the right to report to the Student
Council any disorderly student, who will
be dealt with as seen fit by that body.

sor Brown securing a number of them

mer,

Despite the threatening weather, a
large, representative audience heard
Professor Brown in his first lecture to :
a Davidson assemblage.

After the lecture had been finished the
local chapter of Sigma Upsilon gave a
delightful reception at the S. A. E. hall,
Dr. Brown and Mrs. Pharr being the
honor guests.

Dr. Brown is a member of that fra-
ternity having joined at another school,
so the remarks he made were of especial
interest to the members. Mrs. Pharr
rendered several vocal selections, which
added much to the enjoyment of the
guests. ;

Delicious refreshments were served,
which completed the program of the
meeting.
