Flickerball Teams Vie

By CAPTAIN —_e

NO aucKy

The flicker ball season moved
into gear last week and the
teams are starting to show who
is good and who is rotten. As
usual the rotten teams vastly
outnumber the good squads.

Last Wednesday saw four
teams start on their way to win-
ning their division.

A solid PAX squad opened
their year by beating upon the
hand me down SAE No. 2. A No.
2 behind a fraternity team’s
name usually stands for success
for the opponent, unless the con-

frontation involves a POT team.

SAE No. 1 meanwhile showed
why there is an E No. 2 team as
they pounced on a not-too-bad
PGO bunch by a whooping 90-6
score. Back from Germany
veteran Peyton Prospere led
the Emanon rout.

Em No. 1 showing talent and
depth at every position, and led
by their own inimitable Calvin
Allen trounced the hapless
ATO’s 67-13 in a game that just
ie not go by as being over mat-

The At Zeros can find solace
only in the fact that they did not
choke another close one. Where

Sailors Expand Team,
Initiates Learn Ropes

By TRACY CHARLES
Staff Writer

In conjunction with the
Physical Education directors,
the sailing team has expanded
its ranks to approximately 50
prospective sailo

This program will provide an
opportunity for the members of
the team to teach what they
know to the new people in a
practical way. In this manner,
everyone learns from ex-
perience and from making their
own mistakes and may
progress at their own rate.

This approach to their
education gives the sailor
freedom and in turn a great en-
thusiasm towards what he is

doing.

Sailing is not part a sport con-
fined to the fall and spring ter-
ms. Galesville, Md. was the site
this past August of the Jet
Nationals.

This competition, held yearly
and in a different location each
year, serves as a challenge to
the most proficient skippers in
the country.

Daryl Douglas proved to be
one of the craftiest, most skilled
and most aggressive of all 104
sailors as he walked away with
a first place trophy in one of the
fiveraces. -

Placing consistently high,
Douglas came out eighth at the
end of the last day of races.

Racing this fall looks equally
as promising. There has been a
great deal of skill shéwn by the
new P. E. prospects.

Freshman Chris
Mangelsdorf. sailed at
Christopher-Newport this past
weekend with Dave Francis, a
skipper from last year’s team,
in one of the term’s first SAISA
regattas. Hervey Froehlich
and Gary Lane crewed for
Mangelsdorf and Francis.

Davidson placed fourth out of
five teams. Francis placed
second in the A Division and
Mangelsdorf fourth in B.

are you now, Steve Canterbury?
Em No. 1 is one of the top teams
around, however.

To round out Wednesday’s ac-
tion, the Staten Island Fairies
nabbed a close forfeit win over
the shorthanded Tennis Bums.

“The Bums will be tough if
they can get their players
together”, says player-coach
Jeff (Golden Wheels) Frank.

On Thursday a new freshman
power, rare in a complex sport
such as flickerball, was
unleashed. C-I led by shifty
Walter Crouch dealt the ex-
perienced SPE’s a _ crushing
blow, scoring late in the game
to win 12-7. Here’s a team that
should get better game by
game.

The PKA’s flexed their
muscles a little as Jim Boyd
and Lester Abberger led a
potent offense to a 30-18 triumph
over a young C-IV team.

Unfortunately for the PKA’s
they lack the depth this year to
beat the big teams.

The oddball crew of Miles
Glorius was up just enough to
get past R-I 19-17 in the closest
game of the day. The game even
had a safety for the MG’s as
their defense led the way.

After insulting the N. Main
Gozinyas last week C.A. must
apologize - a little anyways.
They can play alright I guess.
With beer awaiting each unit on
the sidelines, the Goz. found it
in themselves to soundly thrash
C-Ill 47-0. They have much
class to go with their little
talent.

Last Monday saw R-I decline
to show up and get pummeled
by the jock-full Delts.

Fag Tweedy and Tommy Cur-
tis will lead this power house to
the championship, yet again. A
lot more teams would be better
off by watching ‘‘Star Trek”’ in-
stead of getting kicked in by the
Delts.

Meanwhile in an intra-fresh
person battle the male
chauvinist pigs, R-III handed
out a 33-0 lashing to the rather
inept gathering of people titled
the Wimpettes Plus. Do not let

the ‘“‘Plus’’ mislead you folks.

Other freshman games that
day saw S-IV behind Marvin
Lehr, Jerry Stallworth, and
Billy McClean build up an early
lead and coast to a 24-19 victory
over cross-lawn rivals C-IV.
These guys could cause trouble
for most teams, but inex-
perience is the key.

C-I showed they were no fluke
as they jumped all over the
Altoona Aardvarks 28-0.

The AAs should stick to
building banners as all their
class is in their name.

Tuesday saw a real good
blood battle between the SPE’s
and PAX. In sudden death the
PAX people made a 25 yds. in 4
downs while the SPE’s could
only get 10 in their allotted time.
A real fine game, and a big win
for PAX.

The Staten Island Fairies
trying to revamp new faces into
their lineup, had some
a the PKA’s before

and George Loy
showed the way to a 45-21 win.

So after a week of flickerball
it looks like this:

Leage 1 has North Main
Gozinyas at 1-0 along with
powerful Em No. 1 also at 1-0.

League 2 shows C-I and PAX
both tied at 2-0 and this could be
areal scramble.

League 3 has the Fairies at 2-0
with S-IV just behind at 1-0.

League 4 with SAEs and R-3
both at 1-0.

League 5 shows Miles Glorius
at 2-0 while the slumbering
Delts await a team to play at 1-
0.
