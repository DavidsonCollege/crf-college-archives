BAND COMPLETES
SUCCESSFUL TRIP

Excellent Programs Rendered in
Five South Carolina Towns.

The Davidson Band concluded a
most successful trip Saturday, April
the 17th. The musical productions
of the Band were highly praised
everywhere, and many newspapers
have given enthusiastic accounts of
their performances.

Not only did the trip prove a
musical triumph, but a financial suc-
cess as well. This was due in large
measure to the efficient work of the
business manager, C. A. Dunn.

An additional feature of each per-
formance was a number of selec-
tions by the College Quartette, com-
posed of Carr, Freeman, Phillips and

ong. By far the biggest hit on the

rogram was the saxaphone solo hy

uie, who was encored five times
at one performance. Carl Cathey’s
original production, “Bits of Hu-
mor,” added fun and spice to the
whole affair.

The towns visited were Rock Hill,

pee eee oe nenenens—ep |Fort Mill, Lancaster, Kershaw, and

*1B

Chester, eachof which has a better
opinion of Davidson because of our
and’s fine work.

D. R. Freeman, leader of the band,
is largely, responsible for the won-
derful results that have been ac-
complished in the last few months.
Under his leadership, combined with

the hard work of each band mem-,

ber, our band has become a real as-
set to Davidson College.

HOTEL MANAGER
WRITES LETTER OF
PRAISE FOR BAND,

Dr. W. J. Martin, President,
Davidson, N. C.

My Dear Sir:

I had the pleasure of entertaining
the Davidson College Bani at this
hotel yesterday and perhaps it wiil
not be amiss to let you know that in
my ten years’ experience in the
hotel business, I have never enter-
tained a better behaved, quieter or a
more gentlemanly set of young men.
It was a pleasure to have them and
[ can assure you that they reflected
credit on themselves and their in-
stitution by their deportment.

They gave a very creditable per-
formance and played to 9 capacity
house in Lancaster.

Yours very truly,
(Signed) W. T. Williams,
Manager.

GLEE CLUB ENTERTAINS
STUDENTS OF
DAVENPORT COLLEGE

The College Glee Club left Tues-
day afternoon for a short trip to Le-
noir, N. C., to give a concert at Dav-
enport College. There is something
peculiar about this club and it is be-

ond the manager’s ability to solve
it. If they have a good audience,
something inevitably mars the pro-
gram; if. the program goes off
smoothly, something gets wrong
with the audience or rather the au-
dience “isn’t.” In this case, the for-
mer is usually due to some unavoid-
able delay in the train schedule, the
club was held up for a number of
hours, putting them in Lenoir at
8:30 p. m. A very good program was
rendered taking everything into
consideration. The audience was
very inspiring, but the lack of sub-
stance was equally depressing. Due
to a misunderstanding, the soloist,
Fred Justice, did not go with them.
Those making the trip were: Vance,
Carr, McCaskill, Matthews, R. L.
McLeod, F. N. Thompson, Phillips,
Shepard, Thames, Crane, MeGeachy,
Long, G. D. Sample, Cathey, and
Tremain.

DR. LINGLE LECTURES

ON FRANCE

At the last meeting of the Book
Lovers’ Club Dr. Lingle gave an
address on the educational and
political conditions in France. Hav-
ing frequently visited this European
country he was in a position to add
many interesting facts from per-
sonal observation. The ladies met
in the Phi hall recitation room, and
so the lecture was held in a real
French atmosphere.

The Club at its next meeting is
to be entertained by Mrs. Hamil-
ton. Plans for the new annual pro-
gram will be discussed.

C. J. Mattison and L. K. Boggs,
of the Clemson track team, are old
Davidson men who for one reason
or another “fell from, grace.”

Mrs, Dr. Lingle has left for a lec-
ture tour through Florida.
