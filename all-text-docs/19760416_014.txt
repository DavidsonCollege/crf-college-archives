Davidson ail but clinched

decisive 5-4 vicory over power-

ful Appalachian State.

Riding a nine match win-
ning streak, Davidson com-
bined a strong performance in
the singles competition with a
clutch victory in the doubles
by Steve Johnson and Steve
Holman to pull out the impor-
tant win.

Johnson’s and Holman’s
7-5, 6-3 victory in the number
three doubles staved off a
strong comeback by Appa-
lachian that had cut a 4-2
Davidson advantage to a 4-4
deadlock.

Appalachian used several
foreign players during the
match as usual, but they were
ineffective in the singles. Chip
Bondurant defeated Adnan
Khan 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in the
number one match and Brian
Cooper downed a scrappy Phil

’ Secada 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 in the

number five singles.

Cooper’s match was some-
what marred by a series of
questionable line calls in the
first set and an umpire was
used during the last two sets.

Holman and John Mitchell
continued to play excellent
singles as they won 6-1, 6-2

and 3-6, 6-0, 6-2 respectively.

In the other singles matches
Mike Barnhill lost a tough 7-5,
6-7, 4-6 decision to Davis
Bobb and John Trout was
defeated in the number six
singles. Barnhill had match
point twice in the second set
but was unable to put his
opponent away.

The victory gives Davidson
a 5-0 conference record and an
excellent shot at the confe-
rence title. Victories over East
Carolina and Richmond this
Friday and Saturday would
give the Wildcats an unde-
feated season in the Southern
Conference and leave them in a
strong position for the Confe-
rence tournament at Rich-
mond.

Frank sighted an earlier
Davidson victory over Har-
vard as providing momentum
for the Wildcats.

"The Harvard win was
great for team confidence and
after we took Furman 5-4 we
were gone. Now we’re beaten
the defending champs and
we've got a real good shot at
the title.

”Farlier in the season when
you looked at our young team
there was no way you could
pick us to win it all but the
kids have really dedicated
themselves and done the job,”
Frank noted.

Earlier in the week David-
son downed a strong Atlantic
Christian College Squad 7-2
and then traveled to Lexing-
ton, Virginia for matches with
VMI and Washington and
Lee. Davidson destroyed the
Keydets 9-0 and breezed by
W&L 7-2.

Frank was very pleased
with the teams showing in
Lexington especially against
Wa&L.

“‘We proved we were very
tough physically as we won
several matches in the third
set. Also we played on hard
courts and it was a great
confidence booster going into
the tournament which will be
played on hard courts.’
