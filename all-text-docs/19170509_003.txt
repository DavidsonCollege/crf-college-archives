NEW SONG PRACTISED
AT MUSICAL HOUR

The musical hour between 5:30 and
6:30 last Friday afternoon was a distinct
success. ‘Lhe newly organized band,
under the leadership of “Eddie” Childs,
gave a concert in Shearer Hall. The
concert was attended by a large number
of students and townspeople. “Tho it
was only its second appearance, good
music was furnished that would have
done credit to an older band. Never
once was there any hesitation or delay,
but one selection followed another in
rapid order.

As the band came on the stage it was
given an ovation by the students. Many
selections were rendered, always cheered
repeatedly by the enthusiastic gathering.
The “pep” displayed showed that the
new band is not to be a temporary or-
ganization but is to take a regular place
in the college life at Davidson.

The new Davidson song made its
initial appearance. Long delayed, it has
at last been brought forth. Copies ot
the song were distributed thruout the
audience. After it had been played over
several times by B. E. Shields, composer
of. the music, the students, gathering in
the front seats of the hall, sung it to-
gether. Several times it was gone over.
By reason of its stirring words and
swinging air, this battle cry made a
favorable impression on the crowd.

As a fitting close to the afternoon's
performance, “Dixie” and “The Star
Spangled Banner” were rendered. As
the band struck up the tune of our Na-
tional Hymn the whole assemblage rose
to its feet and sung with spirit the last
selection,

Below is a copy of the new Davidson
song:

O DAVIDSON!
(Battle Cry—A Song)
I.
© Davidson, you are the best old col-
lege in the East or West,
You've got the stuff, men, and that’s
enough then,

For you'll win in everything.

Oh when that Red and Black machine
is out to fight and lookin’ mean,

‘Then I am happy as for you [ sing:

Chorus:
O Davidson, we will down them, down
them every one,
O Davidcon, we will conquer, e’er the
day is done;
Down with (Carolina) as through their
lines we run,
(A. & M. then,
(with Virginia,
(then with Clemson,
Win for the honor of old Davidson!
2.
O Davidson, you're more than worth all
the colleges on earth,
You play a fair game, you play a square

‘ game.

And you win in everything.

You're next to none, and when I see you
going on to victory,

Then | am hanpy as for you T sing:

Chorus:

Music by B. FE. Shields, ’20.
Words by FE. H. Hamilton, ‘20.

nounced. You have a training carps a’
Pennsylvania with an officer of — the
regular Army assigned as instructor
The most important service men ca‘
render their country now is to stay at
their university and put in all the time
nossihle under a military instructor in
preparing themselves for probable serv-
ice. There is no reason whatever for
