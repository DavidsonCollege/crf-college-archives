SIMPLIFIED SPELLING,

By a vote of the Staff, it was decided
that simplified spelling would be used in
Tie Davipsonian after this issue. “Phe
entire list of the simplified words will
not be used, at least at this time — but
only the ones which are coming into gen
eral use and which are now found in
many of the leading national publica-
tions.

The attitude of almost everyone
toward reformed spelling is that which
is expressed by the President of the Uni
versity of Minnesota, when he — says:
“Tntellectually | believe that simplifica-
tion of our spelling is necessary; emot-
ionally Uo rebel against the change.”

We feel that there is danger in trying
to force this change too quickly—before
the minds and eyes of a people are ready
for it, but now with several years of
foundation work along this line, we feel
that college students at least should be
ready to take the advance step and use
the new spelling in their publications.
No persons should be more ready to ad-
just themselves to a necessary change. .

The simplified spelling is endorsed by
leading educational authorities through-
out the country, as well as by men ‘espe:
cially notable in practical affairs, and
such is the weight of authority in its
favor that it must come into universal
use eventually. We are glad to be an
added agency in bringing about — this
much needed reform.

PHI SOCIETY HALL.
TO BE REPAIRED

A committee recently appointed by the
president to improve the Phi Society has
let the contract to J. R. Dunn & Co.,
of Charlotte, interior decorators.

The inside walls will be scraped and
refilled, and when finished will be a
buff color. The ceiling will be white.
while the woodwork inside and outside
will be painted. The chandelier, which
took first prize at the first Warld’s Ex-
position in Paris and was given to the
society by an alumnus, will be wired for
electricity, which will add much to the
attractiveness of the hall. The work is
to begin at once.

J. G. Poole, from Mooresville. ha
just onened up a shoe repair shop below
the Henderson House, where the marke
of Mr, Gibbs was recently situated.

VARSITY BASE BALL
WARMING UP

‘The prospects for a winning base ball
team grow brighter each day, as Coach
Fetzer, assisted by Coach Kluttz, put
their proteges through their daily paces
at Sprunt Field. The indications are
that the team this year will be composed
of speedy, fast-fielding players whose
constant aim will be speed and then
more speed. Daily drills in running the
bases are given the Varsity men with
especial attention to development of
speed and wind for the circuit run. The
infield has been working lately with
Saunders, McKinnon, Wood and Black,
and this combination seems to have the
“pep” necessary for a Davidson infield.
Hengeveld, Brown and Walker have
been playing the outfield positions.
Burns is playing in the position of scrub
catcher, Faires first base, Johnson sec-
ond, Boswell and Bill Keesler shortstop
and Younger third. Scrub outfielders
are Sam Keesler, McAskill, Miller

A short six or seven-inning game is
played every few days, to enable the men
to get used to real pitching, and to en-
able the pitchers te become accustomed
to serving them up to real hitters. Law-
son, Shaw, Monteith and Currie’ take
turns dealing out the slants, and all seem
to have a look-in for the Varsity jobs.
final selection at this time is impossible
for any position, but one thing is certain
Davidson is going to have an able, speedy
team this year.
