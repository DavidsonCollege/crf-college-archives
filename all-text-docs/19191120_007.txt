Who, What and Where Among the Alumni

Dr. H. B. Arbuckle a Chemist
of Wide Reputation

Is An Alumnus of Hampden-Sidney
—Came to Davidson as Pro-
fessor of Chemistry in
1913-Greatly Liked

by All Students '

Howerd Bell Arbuckle is an alumnus
of Hampden-Sidney College, having re-
ceived from that college the degrees of
A. B. and M. A. After leaving Hamp-
den-Sidney, he became professor of
Latin and Greek in the State College of
Florida. He then went to Johns-Hop-
kins as a post-graduate student and re-|
ceived the Ph.D. degree. A little later
he wai professor of Chemistry and Bi-
ology at Agnes Scott College. While
at Agnes Scott, he was president of the
Georgia section of the American Chem-
ical Society; was a councillor of the
American Chemical Society ; was a mem-
ber of the executive committe of the
Association of Southern Colleges and
Preparatory Schools: and was president
of the Georgia Association of Johns-
Hopkins Alumni.

In 1913, Di. Arbuckle came to David-
son as professor of Chemistry. The
average student is apt to forget that
the genial and unobtrusive professor is
also a figure of national reputation as
a chemist, having added one to the list
of known elements.. So completely does
he seem wrapped up in the work of mak-
ing the ground principles of chemistry
interesting and intelligible to his classes
that not every student remembers the
fact that Dr. Arbuckle has not only a
very complete knowledge of the discover-
ies of other scientists but has himself
added to the sum of the world’s in-
formation. Yet those who have studied
under him feel that, at least co far as
they are. concerned, his work as an in-
structor is even more valuable than his
work as an independent. scientist.

Though he is an adoptive, and not
a natural son of Davidson, we are proud
to claim him and to honor him as a mem-
ber of the Davidson faculty.
