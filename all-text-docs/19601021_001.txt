Sixty - Three Weekends: |
That's Cop's New Record

By ERVIN DUGGAN

Davidsonian Associate Editor

Sixty-three straight dance weekends. Three a year for twenty-one years.
That’s how many Cop Linker, Davidson’s campus policeman, has seen.
weekends are just routine, he says. Just a little change in schedule, a little more

work.

A dance weekend means
patrolling the parking lots, the
soccer field, the stadium and
the dark corners of the campus
more carefully.

Why?

It's law enforcement. He's
looking for amorous couples in
parked cars.

OBEY THE RULE

“I’m not trying to make ro-
mance unpopular,” Cop . Linker
says; “It's the natural thing to
do. But we've got to obey the
tule,

“You won't find that rule in
the handbook. It’s just under-
stood.”

And so Cop tours the campus
in the wee hours, nudging ro-
mancers away with a honk of
the horn of ‘his battered pick-
up truck.

“The most I usually get is

about a half a dozen, and the
average is about three.

HE'S EMBARRASSED

“I'm always embarrassed to go
up to a parked car. Most boys
think I get a kick out of seeing
how many I can catch, but I'm
always hesitant.

“Usually I tap my truck horn
and flick the lights, then drive
on, slowly. If they don’t move
I come back, and then maybe
there’s some talking done.

“Freshmen of course are the
ones you get the most kick out
of. You have to tell them we
don't allow mixed car. parties
on dance weekends. I say
‘About bedtime, sonny,’ and
sometimes they ask, ‘Well,
where can we park?’ Doggone!
That's already supposed to be
settled. ~ wis,

Roundtable Committee

Election

The Student Union Roundtable Committee will
sponsor a mock presidential and gubernatorial election
in the student assembly Monday morning, October 24.
Preceeding the mock election will be eight-minute
speeches by Republican Tom Colvin and Democrat Char-

les Rose.

curate vote,” said Ed Johnston,

though. I get the impression
they're kind of shaken by the
experience. Some of them hide
their faces.

“I get the impression that a
boy feels like if he’s going to

call it — entertainment.

UNUSUAL POSITIONS

“Why, Saturday nights you
find them parked and they're
sound asleep, worn to a frazzle. |
That's what I don't understand. |
Of course, you find them asleep |
in some very unusual posi-|

Davidsonian Staff Writer

surprise replacement for the

|Hi-Lo’s on the entertainment schedule for Homecoming

| JONI CONTACTED
|

| Cole was able to contact Miss
James’ agent and to arrange for

|will be backed up by the Duke
| Ambassadors.

The weekend began its hec-
tic whirl today as 750 dates ar-

‘J.B.’ Cast

And Polley

Slate Chapel Reading

The Vagabonds and Dr.
a worship service on October

Max E. Polley are planning
27 at chapel period in

ae |

which certain members of the cast of “J. B.”’ and Dr.
Polley will carry on liturgical dialogue.

Dr. Polley will read parts of
Job, and members of the cast
of “J.B.” will read selections
from the play which correspond
to verses in the Book of Job.
In Archbald MacLeish's “J.B.”,
characters parallel those in the
Book of Job. J.B., Mr. Zuss,
Nickles, and Sarah represent

Obstetrics and Gynecology at |J0b, God, Satan, and Job's wife.

The Vagabonds will present
“J.B.” in the dome of Cham-
bers on October 26, 27, and 28.
The Vagabonds will use the
“book version” of the play in-
stead of the re-written Broad-
way version.

“The ‘book version’ empha-
sizes the course of women,”
Hansford Opes, Co-ordinator of
the Vagabonds said. “These wo-
men relieve the tension by
making candid comments on
the situation. This isn't hum-
or, but it gives a different per-
spective to the play.”

The action of “J.B.” alternates
