Felix has been rather weary and for-
lorn for the past few days as a result
of thinking about the thirteen Wildcats
who sing their “swan song” with the
Deacon contest tomorrow.

He cheers up, however, when he thinks
how marvelously these men are going to
perfoym in the Turkey Day classic, He
likes to believe that the Wildcats, with
this group of Seniors getting their last
crack at the Deacons, will pile up at
least a three token margin over

the Baptists.

That's the real spirit of confidence
that every team’s mascot should display,
but I'm afraid my loyal comrade is over
estimating his boys somewhat. I do
agree with him about two-thirds of the
way. A twe touchdown victory for Dav-
idson seems to me a very sane prophesy,
even though the majority are inclined
to anticipate a toss-up.

Tomorrow will be the last time for
Wildcat fans to witness certain features
that have characterized the play of the
Newtonites this season, The Mackorell-
Morgan pass combination, Wingfield’s
spectacular punt returning, Siewers’
Freddie Crawford-like way of getting
down under punts, and the thrilling type
of play that has been displayed in every
contest, are a few-of the things that
have made the supporters like to watch
Davidson on the gridiron this fal}.

Tentative plans have been made for
several alterations in the Wildcat. grid
schedule for next season, and dame ru-
mor hath it that Army and William and
Mary will be replaced on the Davidson
card by the Universities of Virginia and
South Carolina. These two teams from
neighboring states should furnish very
interesting competition for the Felines.

At the University of Georgia, where
the members of the are
recognized by their black derbies, they
have a custom that the fourth year men
parade on the field with the band dur-
ing the half of every home game. Whis
is somewhat similar to a practice that
used to be indulged in here at Davidson.
The cheer leader would march the mem-
bers of the Freshman class over the tield
in a snake dance while the teams were

CALLIGAN WITH ALLSBROOK

It was stated in “The Davidsonian”
several weeks ago_that Woody Calligan,
a graduate of Davidson in the class of
‘31, is with Johnny ‘Long's orchestra.
This was a mistake, as Calligan is with
Bill Allsbrook’s orchestra, and now. has
the job of arranging the numbers of
that band.

While at Davidson, Calligan was with
the “Southernaires” of Davidson, and ar-
ranged the numbers that the band played.
Allsbrook’s orchestra is now playing in
Washington, and in December they will
go to the Paramount Grill in New York
City.

Mr. and Mrs. Fred Fleagle visited in
Davidson during the week, with Prof.
and Mrs. F. K. Fleagle. They are now
making their home in Wilson, N. C.

Schedule For Season Has Not Yet
Been Completed

With football season nearing the clos-
ing whistle and winter's grim grip en-
circling us the thoughts of those aspir-
ing to a berth on the basketball team
have turned to the dribbling ball and
the small white basket which will judge
their defeats and victories—inthe_com-
ing season. Coach “Red” Laird an-
nounced Monday that’a number of can-
didates have been participating in a reg-
ular night practice and that ‘the squad
for the coming year will be rich with
material,

Five varsity men will be available
this season from last year’s cagers. Two
of these men “Big Jim’ Morgan and
Colie Windham will not be out for prac-
tice until football season is oyer. Char-
lie Harris, Courtney Ross and Hugh
Yelverton, all lettermen, have been .re-
porting regularly for night practice and
are Wapidly regaining their last season's
form.

Dick Cathey, Ken Knorr, Maurice
Peabody, “Lefty” Porter and Bill Quick,
who were the mainstays of last year’s
freshman team, are expected to aid ma-
terially in building up this season's five.
Sam Bernardo, Joe Johnston and Colin
Monroe, members of last year’s squad,
have been reporting regularly for night
practice.

The schedule as yet has not been
completed and is not available for this
week's publication. Efforts are being
made, by those arranging the Schedule,
to have a trip in Georgia and if games
in that state can be secured there will
be no other out of state trips. All the
teams represented in the Big Five have
been scheduled by the Wildcats.

For the past week practice has been
held at night but in order to make the
time of practice more convenient to
those on the squad it has been changed
to the afternoon.

Day against old and bitter rivals when
Duke plays N. C. State at Durham, Car-
olina invades Charlottesville to play the
University of Virginia,
meets Wake Forest on her own Richard-
son Field.

The most historic of these rivalries
is that of Carolina and Virginia, who
have played the longest unbroken series
of games in the records of southern
football. The Cavaliers hold a good lead
in this series, having won twenty-one,
lost fourteen and tied three of the thirty-
eight games which have been played.

However, Virginia has made a rather
poor showing this year, and, due to their
victories over strong conference teams,
the Tarheels are highly favored to win.
If Carolina does score a victory over
Virginia, they will stand a chance of be-
coming Southern Conference champions,
providing only that the University of
South Carolina wins over Washington
and Lee in a game which will also be
played on Thanksgiving. The Game-
cocks’ chances of defeating the unbeaten
Generals are considered extremely small.

Juniors in a close 25-22 affair and the
Freshmen again showed their lack of re-

Coaches for the class teams include
Colin Monroe, Hugh Yelverton, Dick
Parker and Charlie Harris, coaching the
Seniors, Juniors, Sophomores and Fresh-
men respectively.

rst meeting of these two famous
es on the gridiron has occasioned
h interest. Duke is considered the
rite, but State managed to tie Caro-
lina earlier in the season, while Duke
lost to them "by a one touchdown mar-
gin.

State also has the added incentive of
knowing that a victory over Duke will
advance them to second place in the Big
Five standing, while a victory for Duke
would not change the ratings. The Wolf-
pack almost succeeded in beating Duke's
powerful 1933 aggregation, and is always
regarded as a dangerous foe by the Blue
Devils. It is certain that Coach Ander-
son will have his charges in shape to
do their best against Duke, in the hope
of redeeming a rather disappointing
season.

The Davidson-Wake Forest game will
determine whether the Wildcats will oc-
cupy the Big Five cellar alone, or wheth-
er they will have the company of the
Deacons.

Counts Chickens Early

Last summer while acting as bouncer
in an Asheville dance hall, Pat Swan
promised a Davidson student that the
Wake Forest Demon Deacons, whom he
captains would trounce the Wildcats
this year 40-0.

Mr. Stewart Barnes, of the Sophomore
class is the gentleman, and he has a
signed statement given him by the Bap-
tist leader, which is convincing proof of
his commital.

He also told Barnes that he would be
safe in saying that only Duke would
defeat the Deacons in their Big Five en-

Stronger In Upper Weights, Four
Meets Will Be Held On
Campus

The Davidson wrestling team is now
well underway in its practice for the
1934-35 season. Regular workouts be-
gan about two weeks ago and all men
are fast getting into shape for the inter-
collegiate meet which will be held in
the near future; two before Christmas.

A good bit of interest has been shown
and a large number of men have an-
swered the call this year to make the
squad the largest in several seasons.

Three lettermén ‘from last year: Cap-
tain Charlie Fort, L. J. Blackwelder,
and Lawrence Quarterman, as well as
most of last year’s squad, are back in
the ring again. Looking good in prac-
tice so far have been Hodgin, Siewers,
and Allan. Frank Owen, on the squad
two years ago, has also returned to
school to add to the number already out.
According to Coach Unger, the squad
this year is strongest in the upper weight
classes.. Probable plans are to use Cap-
tain Fort in the unlimited class.

Tentative plans for meets with V. M.
I., Duke, Carolina, State, Washington
and Lee, and High Point Y.M.C.A. have
been made. Negotiations are now going
on for meets with several neighboring
Y.M.C.A.’s.. The majority of the meets
this year will be held on the campus;
four straight to be held in the local
gym.

HOGAN OUTSTANDING

Davidson Threatens Once In
Fourth Quarter

A bewildered Davidson freshmen foot-
ball team, which did not wake up until
the second half, dropped a one-sided
contest to the yearlings from North
Carolina State College in a game played
on Riddick Field in Raleigh last Fri-
day afternoon, The Wolflets tallied
three times in both the first and second
stanzas and added another in the final
period, piling up a 46-0 count.

Davidson received the opening kick-
off and Lafferty returned it from the
goal line ‘to the 20, Hogan punted to
Berlinski who took the ball on his own
33 yard mark and reeled off 28-yards
before being hauled down on the ’Kit-
tens’ 39 yard stripe, beginning his team’s
first touchdown march. Fullback Hoek
slipped through center for five and then
Berlinski flipped a pass to Berry, which
was good for 25 yards and a first down,
placing the oval on the 9 yard marker.
On the next play State was penalized
15 yards for holding, but Hoek more
than made up for this by dashing around
his own right end to the 5 yard mark.
Lawler picked up 3 at center and then
Hoek crashed over for the score. Gadd
place-kicked the extra point.

All during the remainder of the first
half State, led by Berlinski, Entwistle,
Hoek, and Kuzma, ‘continued to roll up
the yardage and scores, tallying 40 points
before the rest period came. Being
forced to punt only once, they were on
the offensive most of the time. Frequent
jaunts of from 5 to 20 yards produced
five more counters, Hoek scoring once
more, Lawler once, and Kuzma twice.
Ed Entwistle was the key man in the
attack. Besides registering numerous
comparatively short gains, he gathered
intone Wildcat kick-off on his own 15
and zig-zagged his way 8 yards up the
field before being brough down from be-
hind on the 1 yard line by Barrow. Dav-
idson’s only first down came in the sec-
ond quarter when Lafferty cut off right
tackle for seven yards after a pass, Ho-
gan to Brown, had picked up 5.

The second half opened in a driving
rain, which continued to fall all during
the afternoon, turning the field into a
soggy and muddy pond. This seemed to
aid the ’Kittens who completely checked
the State attack in the third period and
played on practically even terms with
their adversaries. However, early in the
final frame the winners slipped over an
additional counter as the result of a se-
ries of line plays led by halfback Mein.
Davidson's only threat came in the
closing minutes of play. The ’Cats recov-
ered a State fumble on State’s 25 yard

line and, after a line play failed to gain.
