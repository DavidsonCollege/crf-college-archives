nition of the Davidson College campus, it twas announced
by the Student-Faculty Conference Committee through
the Student Council at its meeting, May 4.

Student Council President Will
Jackson qualified the definition

pused students using the Lake
Campus will be required to

and from the lake (via the ac-
cess road to Highway 21) with

NSA Stays
Say Fall’s
Opponents

The referendum to keep Da-
vidson in the National Stu-
dent Association should pass
easily, according to the ma-
jor combatants in last fall's
wrangle.

Former Student Body presi-
dent John Spratt was confi-
dent’ when asked about the
vote, and he stated that he
had no doubt of an affirma-
tive poll for NSA. He said
that he felt there would be lit-
tle campaigning and that let-
ters to the editor would prob-
ably be the only form.

Spratt also, expressed the
view that the resolutions pass-
ed at the recent NSA Region-
al Convention would be an
aid in increasing conserva-
tive support of NSA. The
most important resolution is
one that will regulate NSA's
politica) stands on US activi-
ties.

Pat Freeny, a main oppon-
ent of NSA in the fall, stated
that he would not participate
in any conflict over the prob-
Jem.

Student Body President Will
Jackson was available for the
following statement: ‘“USNSA
has continuously made posi-
tive—if not spectacular—con-
tributions to this campus dur-
ing the past year, and in-
creased use of NSA programs
and facilities is planned for
next year.”

no stops in between.

Jackson read a letter from
Tougaloo College that expressed
the thanks of that College to
Davidson for the support given
in the Mississippi school’s drive
to maintain possession of its
charter.

The letter included the assur-
ance of Tougaloo College that
it would continue its efforts,
and it stated that the bill to re-
tract its charater has already
“hit innumerable snags in the
legislature.”

The 1964 Freshman Court,
which punishes violators of
Freshman’ Regulations, w as
chosen by the Council. It is to
consist of three seniors: Jerry
Rogers, Vernon Anderson, and
Mac Mays: three juniors: Joe
Davis, Jim Rollins, and David
Meschani; and one sophomore:
Barry St. Clair, Freshman Ad-
viser John Barrow will serve
as chairman of the Court.

Jackson stated that many Stu-
dent Council members included
ideas on election reforms in
their respective platforms. He
expressed a desire to begin put-
ting these ideas into effect and
appointed a committee consist-
ing of Fred Sackett (chairman),
Chuck Matthews, John Barrow.
and John Gresham.

This committee is to corre.
spond with other colleges during
the summer ,in an effort to
gather new and useful ideas for
better elections.

The Council was reminded to
contact all organizations desir-
ing charter renewals and have
them fill out the necessary form.
It was also asked that all pro-
fessors desiring books to be
placed on the summer reading
list please turn these in as soon
as possible to Andy Little.

Fred Sackett asked that each
fraternity be approached for the
purchase of a $10 John F. Ken-
nedy Memorial Fund ticket.
John Barrow volunteered to pass
to the dean any suggestions put
in his hands concerning orien-
tation alterations.

GertBahanna Will Speak
On Miracles At Assembly

After millions, men, moon-
shine, and miorphine, Gert Be-
hanna, Tuesday's chapel speak-
er, still couldn't find happiness.

Sent to Smith College, Mrs.
Behanna soon left it for her
first marriage. Her first mar-
triage was against her father's
wishes for “he had wanted her
to have a string of college de-
grees.”

In her second marriage she
turned to alcohol. As she puts
it, “I sank into chronic alcohol-
ism on a very high economic
level.” Her third marriage was
no less eventful. She turned to
drugs, trying suicide by barbit-
urates.

During her convalescence
from the suicide attempt, she

realized ‘‘there was no way to
come but up, and there was no-
body there but God." Through
some friends she had casually
met at a dinner party and an
Episcopal minister she had a
religious experience ‘impossible
to put into words—a spiritual
shower bath.”

Several years ago under the
pen name of Liz Burns she

wrote a best seller, The Late
Liz. In this book she tells of the
horrors through which she went.

Mrs. Gehanna’s topic for chap-
el is “Today’s Miracles."* She

Seniors Rebel Against Traditional Gift i

By TOM LOFLIN

A senior smiles with a su-

at least his regrets, when
the fall term traditionally
arrives at Davidson.

another nickel out of me!"’ But
when this statement is made, it

COLONEL WHEATON POINTS TO NEW ‘HOME’

He and his family leave for Vietnam on June 28

Wheaton’s ‘Normal Tour’
Begins Again With Vietnam

By BOB ADAMS

Entering the army in
June, 1945, with a commis-
sion from West Point, Lt.
Col. Paul R. Wheaton has
served what he casually de-
scribes “a normal tour” for
an officer of nineteen years
active duty.

To argue facts with a career
officer is approaching the im-
possible, but to take issue with
Wheaton's opinion is another
matter. Airborne and Special
Forces duty lie beyond the defi-
nition of a ‘normal tour.”
Wheaton volunteered for and
served in both elite combat
components.

In addition, Wheaton com-
manded a rifle company in
the 2nd Infantry Division in
Korea and served as a Regi-
mental Staff Officer in the
tast years of that conflict.

After the Korean combat

duty, Wheaton spent four years’
duty in the Pentagon both as
intelligence officer and as per-
sonnel manager for the infantry
branch.

Three years as ‘“‘numero uno”
in Davidson's ROTC department
would not in itself be a man-
date for change in tha: depart-
ment. Wheaton, however, is a
man who can recognize need
for improvement and then take
the initiative to affect revisions.

Under his leadership two
major additions to the ROTC
curriculum were added: the

flight training program and
the special forces unit, both of
which are utilized on a volun-
teer basis. Believing that
practical participation is the
best instructor, Wheaton has
emphasized getting the cad-
dets “into the fleld’’ to experi-
ence maneuvers and tactics
for themselves.

Wheaton has been pleased by
the response of the freshman
and sophomore cadets to the
tactics problems. Equally sig
nificant to him is the fact that
“The number of cadets going
RA (Regular Army Commis-
sion) has doubled to tripled in
the past few years."

The students are not the Col-
onel’s only concern in the RO-
TC department. Wheaton _re-
quires his officers and NCO's
to take off two afternoons a
week for their health if not re-
laxation. Preferring golf twice
a week, Wheaton paired with
Major Hampton to defeat by
‘luck and a birdie on the 8th"
seniors Bill Pridgen and Jimmy
Lewis in the faculty senior. tour-
nament last Wednesday.

This year the Colonel's re-
sponsibilities have included not
only supervising the department
and teaching seniors but also
the planning and coordinating
of all operations at Fort Bragg
in preparation for this sum-
mer’s ROTC camp. Seniors can
readily assert the formidable
scope of that.

Wheaton, however, will not
direct operations at camp this
summer. The Department of
the Army has ordered him to
assume residence in Dalat,
South Vietnam, as senior ad-
visor to the South Vietnam
Military Academy.

Dalat( about 200 miles north
of Saigon. will" also be “home”
for Mrs. Wheaton and the young
est three of the Colonel's four
children. The. family will begin
residence in the Asian hot spot
on or before June 28.

Also reassigned and not re-
turning to Davidson next fall is
Maj. David R. Hampton, com.
mandant of cadets, who will en-
ter the U.S. Army Command
and General Staff College at
Fort Leavenworth, Kan. Maj.
R. W. Pierce, MSI instructor,
will also be reassigned to other
duty, but his orders have not
yet been received.

Underachiever’s Fate
Produces A Deadlock

The Davidson College faculty voted Tuesday to abolish the system of Academic
Probation but became deadlocked over the underachievement program and decided
to resume the meeting later. .

President D. G. Martin set
next Tuesday as the date,

Another major change is that
students will be allowed to take

as much as 19 semester hours

of work (including ROTC) at
any time regardless of grades.

“You can see how this will
demand a more mature atti-
tude on the ‘part of the student
and greater responsibility for
his work,”’ commented Dean of
the Faculty Frontis Johnston.

No student will be permitted
to carry less than 12 semester
hours (Not including ROTC)
without the permission of the
Executive Committee.

Any student whose perform-
ance in the classroom indicates
he is not making a serious ¢f-

fort to do an acceptable quan-

tity and quality of work may be
required to withdraw from the
College. by the Executive Com-
mittee of the faculty.

Changes were made. too, in
requirements for re admission,
“designed to. make the student
get as much of his work behind
him as soon as. possible,” ac.
cording to Johnston.

Entrance into the sophomore
year will require 25 semester
hours, 22 quality points. En-
trance into the junior year: 58
semester hours, 55 quality
points. Entrance into the senior
year: 91 semester hours, 91
quality points. Requirements for
graduation remain unchanged:
124, semester hours, 124 quality
points. —

Prior to entrance into the jun-.

ior year, the following addition-
al requirements must be met:

—AU college entrance defi-
ciencies must have been re-
moved.

~All freshman requirements
for graduation must have been
completed, including specifical-
ly at least six semester hours

Paper Cops Top.Honor

THE DAVIDSONIAN has once again won an 2f-American
honor rating from the Associated Collegiate Press.

The highest obtainable, the rating is given to only about
10 per cent of the college newspapers judged.

The ACP issues ratings twice a year, and the current
rating is based on THE DAVIDSONIAN issues from the first
semester of this year. THE DAVIDSONIAN was especially
commended by the ACP for the appearance of its front page.

The ACP judges are all professional juornalists. They not
only give each college newspaper a special rating, but also
suggest ways in which the newspaper staff can improve its

publication.

GIVE SIGN ON CONCORD ROAD

t’

anymore: t's
conduct.”

But not so fast, there’s the
little matter of the Faculty-
Senior Class picnic. Another
buck. “What!” screams the
senior. “A whole buck, but |
won’t even go to the, uh,
thing. | see the faculfy enough

in classes, have for four years.

And those ! don’t know now, |
don’t care about. The old nose
won't do any good now.”

Tough: it's still a buck. ‘‘But
I won't pay it: it nas nothing to
do with graduation, and I won't
go to the picnic.”

The answer comes from Fred
McGuirt, the class president—
“Don't pay it. don’t graduate.”
So he pays it.

Now that’s not all. The college
will order invitations for those
who want to invite tenth cous-
ins and kindergarten friends
(nothing like an old friend to
share the big ‘moment) to his
commencement. Ten are free,
after that its a dime apiece.
That may not be too bad, a
greedy senior can haul in a lot
of loot with fifty strategically
sent invitations.

Say you don't have any friends
and no cousins? Well, fill out the

ungentlemanly

form anyway—the Bursar’s of-
fice must have a card from you
saying you don’t. want to order
any invitations. ‘‘Darn red tape,
worse than the Army.”

And then came the revolt
by the majority of the Senior
Class. Unheard of at David-
son? Well, It happened in a
class meeting several weeks
back. And it just might be
that the forces of reaction and
tradition on the campus had
better look into the thing lest
student revolts themselves be-
come a custom.

Walt MacDonald, who had
been appointed by McGuirt to
study proposals for the Senior
Class gifts, got up with his list
of suggestions. He read off such
things as a portrait of Dr. C. J.
Pietenpol, who once served as
president of the college: a mu-
ral of Davidson in 1900 for the
Davidsoniana Room in the Li-
brary; lights for the Reserve
Reading Room in the library;
lights for half the outdoor ten-
nis courts; and books for the
library (which are, it has been
pointed out by some malcon-
tents, a definite need).

Then, just to be nasty, some
smart guy in the back got up

and suggested, or actually mov-
ed, that the fee for the class
gift be reduced to one dollar
from the traditional $2.50.

The motion upset both Mc-
Guirt and MacDonald, who
were members of the famed
Ditto-Mice. They were supposed
to be running the show this
time, and all of a sudden here
was a fellow who wasn't saying
‘‘ditto.”’

“Let's vote on the gift we
want to give first.” pleaded
MacDonald. ‘‘and then decide
how much we want to spend.
That way we can know better
what we'll want to give."

But suddenly there was more
than one rebel, Most of the peo-
ple sitting in the rear of the au-
ditorium and a few scattered
others began to stomp their
feet and shout for the motion
initially proposed to receive the
first. vote, Gentleman and for-
mer Student Body President
John Spratt stood up and. an-
nounced matter of-factly that
Robert's Rules of Order make
it mandatory for motions to be
considered in the order in which
they have been presented.

“We're not using Robert's
Rules of Order here,’ barked

McGuirt.

Then Jimmy Lewis had to get
into the disordered mess by
standing up and suggesting an-
other gift be added to the list
of proposals—a sign on Concord
Road to announce Davidson Col-
lege to the world who passed
that way.

MacDonald and MecGuirt
had their way; the nature of
the gift was voted on first.
Lewis’ proposal won. (’’'We
should be able to get a pretty
good sign for $25," he sug-
gested.) The ilbrary books,
just to show the Davidson sen-
lor knows what is wrong with
Davidson, finished a fairly
strong second.

Then the class voted over
whelmingly to cut down the size
of its donation to a dollar a per-
son. And then for a perfect cli-
max, it was moved and approv
ed that the sign on Concord
Road would bear no mention of
Woodrow Wilson.

There are yet ominous tones
for the future. One rather dis-
tinguished iunior leader vowed.
“We may vote the gift out all
together next year.”’.

That would save another buck.

of credit in Bible, English.
mathematics, and a foreign lan-
guage.

—A minimum of four semes-
ter hours of credit must have
been earned in Basic ROTC. un-
less the student has been offi-
cially excused from taking RO-
TC.

The specific ruling on the
abolishment of AP has yet to be
rewritten following revisions at
the faculty meeting, but in es-
sence the student will be com.
pletely on his own as to meet-
ing the readmission require-
ments, either during the normal
school year or. dl@ring summer
school. If the requirements are
not met, the student will not be
advanced.

Action has not yet been taken
as to when this new ruling will
go into effect, and it certainly
will not be effective before next
fall.

In place of AP. at the end of
each semester and of each mid-
dle semester grading period, any
student. who failed to complete
12 semester hours and 12 qual-
‘ity points for the grading period
under consideration will be no-
tified in writing that his. .aca-
demic achievement is unsatis-
factory and that he must report
immediately to the Dean of Sta-
dents for counseling and for
such additional action as may
be considered advisable for the
improvement of his academic
standing.

The freshman six-weeks grad-
ing report will be done away
with entirely.

With the abolishment of AP
will go of course all its restric-
tions, but again the date and
course of this abolishment is as
yet undecided.

As the faculty committee con-
tinued to read its report, revi-
sions and amendments began
piling up. according to Presi
dent D. G. Martin. Finally after
a number of faculty members
had been forced to leave be-
cause the meeting was running
late into the afternoon, the fac-
ulty became deadlocked in a tie,
vote on one more amendment.

It was suggested that Presi-
dent Martin act to break the
tie, but Martin said_later that he
did not feel that he would be
‘acting in the best interests of
the College by deciding an im-
portant issue as that without the
advice of a number of well-in-

pan

formed faculty members who
had left.’’
It was moved and passed. to
