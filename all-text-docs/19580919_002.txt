Davidson Splits Its Seams

The cots in the gym are a sore
subject in Chambers Building. No-
body in the Administration is quite
sure just how Davidson happened to
turn up with some 915 students to
begin the new year.

Mr. Martin blames it on a long
series of circumstances. (See Page 1).
Others use the cliches “poor guess”
or ‘bad luck.”

Actually the cause is not half as
important as the fact that Davidson
is bursting its.seams. Students return-
ing from fir$t day classes reported
rooms packed. One history class met
with 95 present, an English professor
called a role with 60 names on it,
and men sat on the floor in a Bible
class which numbered over 50.

It would be unfair to make too
sweeping a generalization from these
random instances. However. the men
sleeping in the gym, the crowded
classrooms. and the size of the fresh-
man class, are indicative of a trend
which seems unstoppable. Even now
the traditional picture of Davidson as
a small college offering much individ-

ual attention in the classroom is fast
fading.

The crux of the entire problem is |

the Trustees decision, made in 1957,

to increase the College’s enrollment

to one thousand. At the time of that
decision the governing body of the
College made it clear that the new
students should not be added until
the facilities were available to ade-
quately take care of them.

Obviously, ‘this has not been done.
Not a single student above the pres-
ent number should be added until the
size of the faculty has been increased
and at least one new dormitory built.

According to the Administration's
long range plan to gradually increase
enrollment, the College will: open its
doors to 930 men in 1959.. This would
be an increase of fifteen of twenty
over the 1958 initial enrollment.

The DAVIDSONIAN urges the Ad-
missions Committee. President Mar-
tin. and other members of the Ad-
ministration to junk this plan and
close the doors to any increase in size
until the facilities are available.

Good Intentions,
But No Plans

Educational planning at Davidson,
to be distinguished from the collec-
tion of money and the erection of
buildings. has been at a standstill
since Dr. Cunningham resigned in
1957. Leaving aside the question of
its condition before then, we may
legitimately ask whether it has be-
gun again.

In his Tuesday morning interview
with the DAVIDSONIAN staff (see
front page), President Martin went on
record in favor of an adequate facul-
ty, a good curriculum, and increased
faculty salaries. He did not unveil
any concrete specific plans for get-
ting us to any of these destinations.

It could not have been otherwise,
and no one Gan blame a man who has
just stepped into a job for not im-
mediately making changes that would
require. months of careful planning,
especially at an institution that re-
sists any real reforms with stubborn
tenacity.

Furthermore, deficient leadership,
past or present, is not the only ele-
ment that goes to make up the Da-
vidson version of “dynamic conser-
vatism.”” Our king-size Board of Trus-
tees is by its very structure incapa-
ble of giving more than semi-annual
attention to the college’s problems.
Our faculty and administrative staff
are nearly one-half Davidson gradu-
ates. many of whom think mainly in
terms of the school as it was twenty
or thirty years ago. And the regional
community of parents and alumni
voices no demands that cannot be
satisfied with assuranees fhat David-
son will continue to be ‘‘a safe place.”

In short, the people who are re-
sponsible for the future of the col-
lege are set firmly in an attitude of
“no sweat.” This is perfectly sensi-.
ble—as long as we can remain con-
vinced that we have reached perfec-
tion. Despite occasional maladjust-
ments, we are organized and equip-
ped to operate from day to day on
such a policy.

But for anything better than re-
tention of a stale status quo. we had
better start planning now, or we will
end up with a campus crowded with
beautiful new buildings in a country
club atmosphere, but lacking in any
educational advantages.—C.H.C.

YMCA Begins
New Year

“Worship, study, and positive ac-
tion” — these are the three paths
which the Davidson College Y.M.C.A. _
has set out to pursue in its dedica-
tion to a fuller personal commitment
to Jesus Christ.

It is the third of these that must
receive the greatest concentration of
attention relative to previous years if

force in the college community.

This positive action will be most
powerfully accomplished only by per-
sonal employment by the chairman of
each Cabinet post of each student
who has indicated an interest in the
work of the respective post. Never in

the memory of the present college
generation has this facet of Y activity
been exploited to a degree to even
justify membership solicitation.

The leaders of the Y have always |
been quite capable, and the signal
callers for this year should rank with
the best. The capabilities of these men |
will lie dormant, however, unless they
are borne out in actions: whereby
these leaders serve as the coordina- |
tors between the core of the Y and
every man who desires te contribute
his time and ability to the program.

To say that the effectiveness of
the Y is dependent om the participa-
tion and stewardship of the college
community is but repetition of an old
truism. But this truth speaks to the
Davidson community in that not only
must the Cabinet members personal-
ly seek to reach out for the service
of interested students, but these stu-
dents must put themselves within
reach by fully accepting the respon-
sibility which they assume when they
“pledge up” with the membership
solicitors, and respond to the call for
their service.

There is a great challenge here
to every person affiliated with the col-
lege community in his capacity as
“chief” or “Indian.” The DAVIDSON.
IAN will reserve any due praise un-
til the challenge has been accepted
and a vibrant program of dedicated
effort and worthy achievement over-
comes Apathy.—G.W.R.

Orientation Week Should Profit From Experence

Office of the Dean of Students
in conjunction with the Fresh-
man Adviser, introduced the
class of ‘62 to the academic, so-
cial, spiritual, and physical life
of the Davidson student.

In a series of tests ad-

Dr. Ostwalt.

appraise what. has been called
scholastic aptitude or general

A Co-operative English
Test, which consisted of

two sections on grammar
and one section on reading,

These tests have a number of

Massa's In Cold, Cold Gym

By TOM KERNAN

My good friend, Godfrey
Cringe, and I were aggravating
our palates with Slater Service
coffee the other day when that
well known  gentleman-dandy,
Roger Tweed, hove into view.

“— and even squirrels, but
not me, a. gentleman and a
scholar,” he was mumbling in
an aggrieved tone.

“What's your gripe about Da-
vidson’s rodent population?” I
asked.

“I was saying,” he replied,
“that even the squirrels have
a place to: live, but not Roger
Tweed, friend of fashion and
good taste. Those fiends have
placed me in the gymnasium;
its like being in the quarantine
ward on Ellis Island. Yes, they
can’t find so much as a hole
for 2 fellow to room in.”

frey.

Rush Week

By ED ARMFIELD
Davidsonian Managing Editor

The Davidson Rushing Sys-
tem despite the fact that the
IFC, under the leadership of
Vernon Anderson, has run it
with a minimum of snags and
inconveniences, has been the
subject of much discussion, pro
and con.

One freshman, somewhat
dazed by it all, called the sys-
tem, “the most unfair and un-
reasonable way possible to
foree a premature and often
unwise choice.” Others have de-
fended it just as vigorously as
this man condemned it..

INSINCERITY

The most obvious disadvant-
age of the early and very short
rush week is the almost impos-
sible task of learning the true
character of a boy or group of
boys in such a short time. It is
a system which leads to insin-
ecrity often to the point of mis-
representation. Those arguing
for a rushing system stretched
out over a longer period of
time feel that a “front” could

in the gym has done to my

would weep. from shame if he
could see my wardrobe now.”

“How are the other fellows
down there getting along?” I
asked.

.

“Oh, we're a plucky lot.” he
answered. “but I don’t know
how long we can stand it. Peo-
ple have been quite helpful,
though. The Y sent a team down
the other night to lead us in.a
prayer meeting and they left
some helpful tracts for us to
tead. The administration sent
each of us a form letter about
the situation; we’re quite hope-
ful that something can be
done.”

‘IT hear that the—the (here
Godfrey paused apologetically,
searching for the right word..
—the, uh—aroma down there
isn’t too pleasant.”

“Don’t,” begged Roger in a

weak voice, “don't mention it,
please.”

At that moment, a small:
freshman approached our table,
weeping hysterically.

“Why it’s Wilson Quiver,”
said Roger, “he lives in the gym
too. What have they done to
you, Boy?”

“Look.” wailed Wilson, and
he tore open his shirt, reveal-
ing his narrow chest to our hor-
ror.stricken gaze. Across the up-
per portion of his abdomen was
stenciled the following poig-.
nant message: PROP. D.C.A.A.

“No,” I gasped, “how could
they.”

“They did it while I was
asleep.” he moaned and. broke
into another fit of crying.

“This is too much,” said
Roger,, “this time the Athletic
Department has gone too far.”
And he strode toward the door
with the air of a man intent on
making heads roll, or as might
befit a gym dweller, making
them bounce.

Another disadvantage in the
present system is that it pro-
motes a “hometown fraternity”
situation, in that freshmen oft-
en join a fraternity alrehdy
having boys from their home-
town not necessarily because
he is sure it is the best, but
merely because he is not yet
well acquainted enough with

“bullsessions” for freshmen
lasting late into the morning
is quite unnecessary.

Those speaking in favor of
the present system point out
that the first week rushing in-
terferes at a minimum with aca-
demic work. which is para-
mount here at Davidson.

It. is also thought by some
that the present system “equal-
izes" fraternities to a certain
degree. However, this line of
thought seems difficult to de-
fend, although it may well be
true.

SOCIAL LIFE

As far as the rushee is con-
cerned, the main advantage to
the present system is getting
into a fraternity early and thus
bolstering his sdcial life.

No matter how we feel. every
fraternity man has a voice in
fraternity affairs through his
IFC representative which
should be exercised, as the ma-
jority opinion will dictate what
course future Rush Weeks shall
follow.

mine the quality of the
freshman class on a ne
tional scale, and each stu-
dent may obtain his own
results in a couple of
weeks.

This period helps the fresh-
men to feel at home in an en-
tirely different environment.
Each freshman has a chance to
meet his fellow classmates and
upperclassmen before the pres-
sure of studying begins.

As one freshman said,
“The Orientation Program
has covered the make-up
and functions of the vari-
ous departments and or-
ganizations, and it has con-
veyed the Davidson spirit

to its new arrivals.”

Each year we profit from the
past year’s experiences. Inno-
vations this year included a
better scheduled Orientation
Week, an activities fair, and
fewer speeches.

Improvements for next year
call for better organization dur-
ing the physical proficiency
tests to aid everybody in find-
ing his way from station to sta-
tion in the gym, restricting the
number of upperclassmen at
the Davidson-Queens Dance, and
a program whereby the fresh-
men can become better ac-
quainted before the upperclass-
men arrive.

Salmagundi

By JOHN TOUMARAS

Now that rush week's over and classes have gotten
underway, I suppose that Davidson will settle down to
its traditional norm of lethargy, apathy, and indifference.
But it need riot! We upperclassmen have an obligation
to attempt to create a better Davidson and to make our-
selves heard by the trustees and administration. The
freshmen have an obligation to themselves to sharpen
their imagination, become more aware, and strengthen

their personality.

Although Davidson College is a fine institution, it
has its problems. Jf you upperclassmen will bear with
me, I would like to enlighten the freshmen about some of

them.

One primary trouble spot is the recent decision to
increase the enrollment. This one decision has led to a
host of problems, among which are inadequate dormitory
facilities, over-crowded classrooms, over-worked profes-

sors, and inadequate library
ing planned, but when will

We need more professors! The history department
has been shy a man for two years. The philosophy, so-
ciology, and political science departments each contain
only one professor. They need help! The Spanish and psy-
chology departments have only two professors. One his-
tory class contains as many students as a professor's load
would normally be. Every department is overworked, and

every student will suffer.

There are other problems, however. The cirriculum

LETTER TO EDITOR

Reader Sees Irony

In Local Rush Week

Dear Editor:

This has been religious em-
phasis week. It goes under an-
other name, but it has all the
characteristics of a real religi-
ous observance. What other
week brings out such sacrificial
service from such a large num.
ber of students; calls forth so
many hours of allegiance to a
single cause?

For a full week the up-
permost thought in all our
minds has been fraternity.
Everything hes been done
for, or at least in the per-
spective of, “the good of
the brotherhood.” More
work, talk, thought, and en-
thusiasm have been devot-
ed to this concern than will
be given in any other
month to any of the so
called religious activities
on campus.

What is a persons’ god but
that to which highest allegi-

ance is given? Who are we kid-
ding when we say that we are
devoted first to the church,
when our time and efforts say
that the fraternity is number
one on our list?

Pechaps we should not be
surprised at the situation,
for what is it but a mani-
festation of our deep self-
interest? The fraternity is
designed to benefit prim-
arily its own members. tt
is not outgoing. The church,
though admittedly far be
low its own professions, is
intended to be concerned
with those outside itself. So
naturally we are more in-
terested in the fraternity.
We “get the most out of
it.’

It is ironic that a “church-
related” college has a fraterni-
ty-related student body, After
this week, who can deny it?

Fraternally.
