Chapel Conduct Again

Looking back over several years of edi-
torial pages of ye olde DAVIDSONTAN, we
see that a matter of concern to thoughtful
fillers of these columns has been Ghapel con-
duct. The question has been approached from

every angle. Indignant students, along with |
: : ° |
the editors, have broached the subject from

many points of view, always aiming at im-

proving conduct.

Anybody reading our pages over a period |
of time (that’s taking lot for granted) |
and having no other contact with our chapel *}
exercises might get the idea that ‘‘Little |
Monster’’ and his 1 bunch of
Slackers compared with the Davidson stu-
@ent body. We are pictured as being irrev-
erent during worship services, impolite and
~eyen openly rude to visiting speakers and
our own professors, Juvenile in our anties,
and so on, ad infinitum.

These writers have pleaded with us to
remember that we are ventlemen, and as
such, courteous and. reverent. They have
played on our sympathies, picturing for us
the agonies suffered by the poor frustrated
fellow student who is trying to put some-
thing across to us. One writer tells us about
the embarrassment he had to endure when
news of our treatment of suest—artist
got home ahead of him.

All in all, we have been told, our con-
duct has been scandalous. We have been re-
minded that Mondays and Wednesdays,
faculty days, should be observed soberly
and with a minimum of audience partieipa-
tion. Friday is YMCA day/and should be
received according to the type of program
the ‘‘Y” Presents. Tuesdays and Thursdays
are student days and after the brief faculty
devotional, the student body is at liberty
to do anything it wants to with the rest of
the program.

Why Editors Die Young
Subject: Davidsonian Story,
To: Bob Hollister, Managing Editor:

I have investigated all leads concerning
the possibilities of getting a story of the
Davidson Community Chest Drive.

T have seen: (1) Hugo. (2) Mayor Beaty.

These are the facts that [ can tell you,
as they told them to me.

There was nothing that either could tell
me about the chest in general.

There was not going to be a drive, as far
as either of them knew, here in Davidson.

No

citizen

of Davidson was actively
working on this project.
Anything that Davidson does will be

handled through Charlotte.

There’s nothing here for a story.

I hope you will understand, and have
compassion,

Letters to Editor

SENSE VS. NON-SENSE
Dear Ed: : :

“The Seeretary of the Department’ of
Information of the Central Goverment sat
up straight in his chair, for he had conceived
an idea which he believed would increase the
interest in the Department’s instrument of
communication “*The Nation's Report.’ THe
deemed this action advantageous, beeause,
though the report was made easily accessi-
ble to all, it’s reading was not compulsory.

To launch this program of revitalization,
the Secretary printed in a Report feature
‘The Citizens Speak,” a letter from a citi-
zen of a Status state. (Though strictly
speaking, the citizens of the Central Govern-
ment could be divided into three separate
groups: the Status states, the Neo-Status
state and the Non-Status, it should not be
forgotten that all were citizens of the same .|
Central Government, irrespective of their
minor ‘status.’’)

The letter printed was an atiack, strong-
ly exaggerate(l, on the Neo-Status, and was?
penned by a staff member of Report (prob-
ably. written to start the program rolling).
This letter stirred up considerable -contro-
versy among the citizens of the government
who read the letter, and as a result another
letter was_printed in the following issue,
from a ‘citizen. of the Status.’ This letter
followed the vein of the previous one in that

POLITICS
Jim Riddervold

The obvious and basic difference
between the Democratic and Re-
publican parties is not one of high
ideals, but instead one of division
between labor and capital. To ex-
pand this statement just. slightly,
the Republican party is one which
caters to the interests of big busi-
ness and capital, while on the othet
hand, the Democratic party is one
Which caters to the interests of the
poor and oppressed worker. Now
the average man, the one who puts
the president in the White House,
must decide in certain periods ot
time the type of government that

is needed at that point in time.
Today an expansion of business
through government aid is neces-
sary. The poor and oppressed work-
er is no longer poor nor opressed.
Quite to the contrary he has been
given complete freedom and is at
the

present riding on crest of a
wave of prosperity. It is through
this rise, phenomenal to say the

least, that prices have risen along
with wages. Expansion by the busi-
interests

ness is not able to keep
pace with this rise. It is time that
the needed control of this rise be
applied. When a jar is overflow-
ing, a lid must be applied... Now

business, the control of. this racing
labor movement, which racing I
might add, is to the detriment of
the business interests, will come in
the form of legislation advantageous
to big—business:

Now why this interest in big busi-
ness? It is an obvious question and
one which can be answered with
a minimum of flag waving. (The
cynicism which prevails “on this
campus will not allow one to men-
tion too much about one’s nation).
This is a capitalistic-nation, Capi-

For nearly thirty years there has
been a growing agitation for a,two-

as 1920, the more progressive Sou-

vote to Republican candidates, and

But for all their loyalty to the
Democratic Party in) years past,

what have the Southern Stutes reap-
ed in exchange? Can anyone point
to vast appropriations by any Dem-
\dministration to the South
such as those that are

ocratic
constantly
being heaped upon the States of the

North and West? Has a Presi-
dential candidate of one of the
two larger parties ever carried on

an extensive campaign in the South

similar to those that Truman and
Dewey conducted in the West re-
cently? Even Franklin Roosevelt,
whom most Southerners idolized,
seoited at the poley of the Solid
South. This, in spite of fact
that Southerners four times ‘wave
him their unswerving support, in
some States casting as much as

ninety-seven percent of their votes
for him.

This r, however, the story may
be different. The young, virile, for-
ward-looking generation of South.
erners today has come to see the
folly of throwing away their—votes
to a candidate who does not so-
licit them, appreciate them, or —
except once in the last forty years
— need them for his victory. The
time is at hand when the South will
not cast its’ hundred and twenty-
seven electoral votes blindly for a
Democrat. The day dawning
when the modern, revitalized South
will sell its its support
to the highest bidder, just as the
North and West do. When that
day dawns, then all the nation will
know that the South has come in-

tion has

risen from a weak and
powerless colony to°a great nation
of strength and power through the
benefit of government aid to big
business. Now the obvious answer
to this statement is, that big busi-
ness has abused this advantage.
When these abuses have become
over bearing, a man has been elect-
ed to the Presidency Who, under
the title of “liberal,” has instituted
a program of reform to the benefit
of the poor and oppressed worker.
When this liberalism has run its
course the balance again shifts, This
Process is continual. Panies and de-
pressions have been precipitated by
this balance not shifting at the
right-time-nor quickly~enough. Tf,
then, we

are to avert the promised

shift the balance back in favor of
the big business interests. We must,
