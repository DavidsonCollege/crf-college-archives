Outdoor basketball court proposal fails in SGA

Tie vote kills resolution Tuesday, but Rudell will continue to pursue the cause

By Jay Jennings

During an animated SGA
meeting on Tuesday, the Student
Government Association rejected
the resolution for new outdoor bas-
ketball courts proposed last week.

The, new basketball courts
would have replaced 20 to 25 park-
ing spacing in the tennis court park-
ing lot, but would have provided
an adequate outdoor athletic outlet

for students. SGA President Eric
Rosenbach says, “parking and the
alcohol policy are two issues which

’ spark controversy.”

The vote ended in a tie; a ma-
jority vote is necessary for a reso-
lution to be passed. Senior Class
President B.J. Rudell plans to bring
the resolution up again in two
weeks, hoping that it will pass this
time.

Thanks to the efforts of the
Student Government Association,
the Patterson Court Council, and
the Student Union, the entire
Davidson College student body
was able to spend Saturday hang-
ing out at the Lake Campus, eat-
ing great food, listening to the
music of the Steel Drum Band.
Other musical performances in-
cluded the Liquid Pleasure con-
cert on Saturday night and
Davidson's own jazz band, which
played Friday evening.

Students also got the oppor-
tunity to meet with professors ina
social setting at the jazz mixer
outside Chambers on Friday and
at the 50’s dance in the Commons
on Saturday.

The planning of the Fall Fes-
tival began last year when stu-
dents—like SGA Vice-President
Allison Sabel—began proposing
ideas for social alternatives for
freshmen before: they were al-
lowed on Patterson Court. “We
wanted to initiate a campus-wide
event that would be a non-alco-
holic way for everyone to meet
more people and have fun,” she
says.

Vail Commons was respon-
sible for catering the jazz mixer
as well as the 50’s dance. Sub-
way and the SGA provided a de-
licious lunch of hot dogs, ham-
burgers, veggie subs, chips, cook-
ies, and drinks for students who

The removable basketball
court surface would not cost the
college any money during the first
year of use, but would cost $5000
each additional year.

Rudell says, “The cost of the
court is only a fraction of the total
sports budget and would not hinder
other athletic programs.”

The existing outdoor courts
were built for use by summer

camps, not for Davidson College
students. Kamil Shah, an avid
basketball player, says, “The
present courts are too slippery, have
too many obstacles, and have bent
rims. We need new courts.”

Jo Burrows, the Connor SGA
representative, says that “there is
not enough interest on campus for
a basketball court,” and thus felt
obligated to reject the resolution.

David Wick, Sophomore
Class Senator, says, “I look for-
ward to having new basketball
courts, but I do not think that the
proposed area is the best sugges-
tion.”

The basketball court issue has
not died, and if strong feelings
exist, students need to share their
feelings with their SGA represen-
tative before Tuesday’s meeting.

spent their Saturday at the Lake
Campus.

The weekend definitely
seemed to be asuccess and boasted
terrific attendance at all of the
events. On Saturday morning,
freshman halls worked together to
race their homemade rafts in the
freshman regatta, whichconcluded
in a victory by 1st West in their
kegmobile.

Fall Festival also combined a
campus-wide social event with a

fundraiser for Davidson Day Care.
The 50’s dance in the Commons
on Saturday night raised proceeds
which totaled over $3500, all of
which will be donated to Davidson
Day Care. This provided a way for
Davidson students to help out those
less fortunate than themselves
while still having fun.

When asked about the success
of the first Fall Festival, Sabel said,
“T am so excited that both the fac-
ulty and the students cared to come

to something like the mixer. This
is the first time’*we have done
something like this, and it prob-
ably won’t be the last.”

Special appreciation goes out
to all the hard work and careful
planning done by those who made
Fall Festival areality: UnionCom-
mittee Chair Rosie Molinary,
Patterson Court Chair Josh
Worsham, and SGA officers Sa-
tah Beth Hamlin, Jennifer
Palazzalo, and Allison Sabel.

New apartment building still working out quirks
“We needed three weeks to do what we had only one week to do.”

The construction on the new-

Martin Court F, is complete, but
the building’s maintenance prob-

On September 1, Rebecca Pe-

find their kitchen flooded with

refrigerator. The next day, RLO
responded quickly, sending Physi-
cal Plant workers to take out the
wall and replace it with dry wall.
How do these women feel
about Martin Court’s newest apart-
ments? Peters says, “Some things
were not done as wellas they should
have been.”-She contends .that the
problems are only “little things”:

room doors are not flush, making
them hard to close and lock; apart-
ment doors are not opening, caus-
ing residents to use their windows;
the fire alarms are “always going
off’; there is no cable, though
residents already paid for the ser-
vice.

Susan_Pfahl, the staff archi-

edges these incidents as problems.
She says that the dilemma with the
outside and inside doors remains
unresolved.

The door latches are hard to
open because they must comply
with the ADA regulations for
handicap access. Pfahl says some

smoking

The message, “Watch this
space! This room is being con-
verted into a modern classroom for
Bibliographic Instruction. If you’ re

looking ‘for a place to smoke, try
the 24-Hour Study Room,” covers
the windows of the third floor
smoking lounge.

The E. H. Little Library staff
decided during the summer toclose
the smoking room in order to pro-
vide the library with a classroom
for teaching library skills to’
Davidson students.

Library Director Dr. Leland
Park says the smoking lounge
stands as the only room in the
library that can electronically
handle lighting control and projec-
tion facilities.

Last year the library staff held
information sessions for over 1000
students. The staff complained
about the lack of a central place to
conduct teaching sessions. ~

“The smoking lounge was a
small room that was never used
heavily,” says Park. Park explains
that students who smoke should go
to the 24-Hour room in the base-
ment of the library.

“The 24-Hour Room, group
study rooms, and. the smoking
lounge have always been open for
smoking,” says Park. The 24-Hour
Room was originally designed as a
dual purpose room for smoking
and studying.

“I sympathize with smokers,”
says Park; however, this is a sensi-
tive situation with strong arguments
on both sides. “I must look after
everybody’s opportunities and
rights,” says Park. :
