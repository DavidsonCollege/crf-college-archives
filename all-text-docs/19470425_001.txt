Dr. Ricks is one of the most dis-
tinguished men in fraternity circles
today. He is a native North Caro-
linian and about eighty-three years
old. After receiving his degree
from the University of North Caro-
lina, where he was a founder of the
Alpha Tau Chapter of Sigma Chi,
he became one of the ablest young
lawyers in the east. However, after
a few years he abandoned his law
practice to enter the theological
school at Vanderbilt, where he was
instrumental in the founding of Al-
pha Psi Chapter of Sigma Chi. After
graduation he became distinguished
in the Methodist ministry until a
number of years ago, when he was
retired because of his age. Dr.
Ricks was at one time Grand Prae-
tor of the seventh province of Sig-
ma Chi, and in 1941 was: elected
grand consul of the fraternity. Al-
though his term at this post has
expired, Dr. Ricks has continued to
work unceasingly for Sigma Chi
and fraternity men in general. He
has been instrumental in founding
more chapters of Sigma Chi than
any other person, and visits the one-
