Week in Washington : :
House Republicans unveil

spending cuts in budget

By ANDREA SHORT
Washington Week correspondent

House Republicans an-
nounced on Wednesday their first
substantial proposals to reduce
government spending. Fifty days
after the Republicans stormed
Capitol Hill with their Contract
with America, House Republicans
unveiled their first detailed budget
cuts. A form of mid-year review,
the cuts, known as recissions, are
an in-progress review of the cur-
rent budget year. Republicans are
challenging President Clinton’s
$1.1 billion cuts with a plan that
would shave government spend-
ing by $10-15 billion.

Five House committees an-
nounced their recommendations
last week, and more cuts are ex-
pected when the remaining com-
mittees finish their deliberations.
Programs and agencies affected
by the Republicans’ proposals
would include: certain education
programs, Head Start, job training,
and aid to homeless children and
veterans. Although the Republi-

cans’ suggestions would hit social —

programs the hardest, they also
targeted aid to newly independent
Soviet republics and the United
Nations peacekeeping force.

The most drastic measures

proposed, however, would elimi-
nate certain education programs

‘entirely. Programs that provide

immigrants with high school
equivalency degrees and financial
aid for college, education for home-
less youth, and the drug-free
schools initiatives would be dis-
carded.

One of the most controver-
sial changes demanded by Repub-
licans involves the school lunch
program. Educational and Eco-
nomic Opportunities Chairman Bill
Gooding of Pennsylvania is ex-
pected to announce his committee’ s
recommendation to end federally
supervised school lunch programs
in favor of a block grant to the
states. Under the Republican plan,
federally subsidized school lunches
and the Special Supplemental Nu-
trition Program for Women, In-
fants, and Children (WIC), would
be collapsed into one block grant.
The states would then decide how
to allocate the funding; the only
mandate would state that 80 per-
cent of the monies benefit impov-
erished children’s nutrition.

The committee’s ranking
Democrat, William Clay of Mis-
souri, however, believes this
change could “potentially starve
hundreds of thousands of children
and imperil the health of their moth-

ers.” The school lunch program
alone serves nutritionally sound
breakfasts and lunches to more than
25 million children daily. Under
the block grant, the federal gov-
ernment would not require free
lunch programs or ensure any nu-
trition standards. Representative
Gooding, traditionally a strong
advocate of the school lunch pro-
gram, defended the new plan, say-
ing, “by cutting out layers of regu-
lations and paperwork, and by al-
lowing states far more flexibility,”
the program could be run more
efficiently.

Clear progress in cutting the
federal budget is paramount to es-
tablishing Republican credibility.
A major tenet of the Contract with
America, spending cuts form the
backbone of the GOP’s promise to
lower taxes. Most political ana-:
lysts predict that the Republican
majority will be enough to push
the recissions through the House
easily. Surviving the Senate will
prove a more difficult fight, but
success is also expected there. If
neither house makes a substantial
change inthe drastic education cuts,
however, President Clinton seems
likely to veto the legislation.

Dean Rusk

Economy, Chechnya, health tarnish

By GRAHAM Ernst
Dean Rusk adjunct reporter

In his annual address on the
state of the nation last week, Rus-
sian President Boris Yeltsin pre-
sented a strong defense for invad-
ing the breakaway republic of
Chechnya and promised that po-
litical and economic reforms would
continue as planned. However,
Yeltsin faces problems that reach
deep into his political policies and
personal life.

First, the Russian economy is
struggling to compete in interna-
tional markets with an extremely
weak ruble and relentless infla-
tion. Yeltin’s horrendous approval
rating of 6 percent is often attrib-
uted to the floundering economy.

Second, the civil war in
Chechnya has strained Yeltsin’s
relations with his own military and
with Western nations. During his
address to Parliament, Yeltsin
called for “resolute measures” to
reform the military. Defense Min-
ister Pavel Grachev and Yeltsin
have been at odds since the
Chechen invasion began resulting
in large numbers of Russian sol-
dier casualties.

While the United States and
other NATO countries urge Yeltsin
to negotiate a peace settlement in
Chechnya, a report released by the
President’s Commission on Hu-
man Rights this week said that
24,000 Chechen civilians have died
in the two month war with govern-
ment forces. Unfortunately, many

speculate that accurate figures of
civilian casualties easily exceed
30,000.
Finally, Boris Yeltsin’s alco-
hol abuse and health have been
scrutinized since he was filmed
exiting his limosine staggering,
clinging onto aids for support, and
slurring his speech. This is not the
first occasion where Yeltsin has
arrived intoxicated to a function.
Last year he slept through a
meeting with Irish government
officials because he had celebrated
abirthday party onhis plane. There
are reports that Yeltsin’s alcohol-
ism has gotten worse recently as he
has removed aides who attempt to

s

sin
=] moderate his consumption.

Yeltsin has chronic back prob-
lems and cirrhosis of the liver.
4 Eventhough the next presiden-
tial election is not scheduled
until 1996, Alexander Rutskoi
] and Vladimir Zhirinovsky are
campaigning to position them-
] selves as front runners should
Yeltsin be unable to serve out
his term.
7 Yeltsin’s state of the nation
address was significant in that
he assured the world that he is

ise] in good health for the time be-

f ing, and that, parliamentary
elections will take place in
December of 1995 as sched-
-o | uled. Furthermore, he prom-
wiiy_ised not to impose on the free-
*] dom of the press despite the

4 sketchy reports that leaked out
fof Chechnya in the opening
days of the war.

Yeltsin stands on shaky
ground in Russia. He is running
out of allies and responds by re-
verting to an inner circle of suspect
advisors. As a result, it will be
extremely important for the world
to monitor developments in Rus-
sia in the next year with concern
and vigilance.

NOTES

SC attorney general supports battle flag
Columbia, SC— The confederate battle flag should remain
atop the South Carolina Statehouse unless the legislature
takes it down, the new Attorney General said Friday, revers- |
ing the opinion of his predecessor. Attorney General Charlie
Condon asked the state Supreme Court to dismiss a lawsuit
challenging the flag or allow him to prepare a new brief
outlining the state’s revamped position.

Dole drives mayor bananas

Izmir, Turkey— A Turkish mayor who doesn’t like Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole banned the sale of Dole bananas
in his town, claiming Friday that the Senator owns the fruit
company.

Turks accuse Dole, R-Kan., of being anti-Turkish and
blame for an attempt in Congress to deny U.S. aid to Turkey
for refusing to allow relief supplies for Armenian refugees
to pass through the country.

Dole Food Co. has no connection to the Senate majority
leader, said company spokesperson Tom Pernice.

Nashville Arena too close

to church to serve alcohol

Nashville— City officials in Nashville have just found out
that “Bible Belt” is more than just a name. After one year of
construction, officials have recently discovered a horrific
truth that will halt work on the city’s new $120 million
entertainment and sports arena.

The arena is 15 feet to close to the First Baptist Church
for alcoholic beverages to be sold in the arena, according to
acity ordinance that requires establishments that sell beer to
be at least 100 feet from a church or school.

The city is searching for ways to get around the restric-
tions. :
