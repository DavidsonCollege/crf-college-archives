Two Other Cities Added
To Northern Alumni Tour

Staunton, Va., and Philadelphia Will
be Included

The alumni secretaries have about com-
pleted all their plans for a Northern tour,
which. has been augmented since first an-
nouncement was ‘made of the proposed trip,
by the inclusion of Staunton, Va., and Phila-
delphia, Pa., in addition to the mectings at
Richmond, Va., Washington, D. C., Balti-
more, Md., and New York.

Alumni in Staunton learned of the plans
of the local office and wrote in requesting a
meeting, stating that the alumni would like
to meet together, whether an organization
resulted or not. The gathering in Philadel-
phia will be along the same lines, since many
of the alumni in that city are attending med-
ical schools, but it was decided to call them
together, and discuss Davidson with them.

Messrs, Branch and Milton, the secretaries,
will both attend the alumni meeting in Rich-
mond, Va., and while Mr. Branch is present
at a meeting in Staunton, Va., on Thursday,
March &th, Mr. Milton will be holding one
simultaneously in Washington. Mr. Branch
will return to Davidson from Staunton, while
Mr. Milton will complete the tour of six
gatherings.

These six meetings will reach over 150

alumni of Davidson, and letters which have
been received at the alumni office indicate
that the men in these various cities are inter-
ested in local organizations, and will attend
in large numbers. The New York group is
the only one which is organized at the pres
ent time.
