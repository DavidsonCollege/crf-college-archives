Two Students Directing
Boys At Barium Springs

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Associate Editor

There are not many peo
ple who can be full-time stu
dents and raise a family of
eight at the same. time.
Charlie Baker and Bill Wil-
liams, however, are trying
to do it.

As students they are both
Davidson seniors headed to
medical school next year.
Their job since November |
has been to serve as house-
parents for a house of eight
at Barium Springs Home for
Children, a Presbyterian-af
filated complex of homes and
recreation facilities about a
mile outside Statesville.

“I think we are fortunate
to have this opportunity,”
said Williams, who served as
a- counselor at Barium
Springs two summers ago.
“We are the youngest house
parents here. Most of them
are 50 years old or older.”

“Sure, we miss out on
some things at Davidson,
like the basketball games,”
said Baker, “but we don't

really miss them. During my
four years at Davidson, this
is the best experience I've
had.”

Kaufmann Sees
Crisis In Morality

By STEVE CROSS
Staff Writer

Dr. Walter Kaufmann,
professor of philosophy at
Princeton. University, will de
liver a Reynolds Lecture
here Feb. 17-18. on “The
Crisis in Morality."

At 8:15 p.m. Feb. 17 in the
Morrison Room of the Col-

lege Union he will discuss
“The Birth Pangs of Hones
ty." In assembly at 10
a.m. Feb. 18, ‘‘Existentia
lism and Responsibility’’ will
be his topic.

Kaufmann is the author of
six books and the translator
or the editor of several
others in the area of existen
tialism, philosophy of reli-
gion, and the thought of
Nietzsche and Hegel.

He was born in Friedburg,
Germany, in 1921, and grew
up in Berlin. He graduated
from Williams College in
Williamstown, Mass., in 1941
as a Phi Beta Kappa.

He served with = great
distinction in the Second
World War and later re-

ceived his PhD from Har
vard University in 1947. He
soon secured a teaching posi-
tion at Princeton University,
which he still holds.

His books include ‘‘Nietz-.
sche: Philosopher, Psycho-
logist, Anti-Christ*', “‘Criti-
que of Religion and Philoso-
phy.’ “From Shakespeare
to Existentialism; ‘Studies
in Poetry, Religion, and
Philosophy,”’ ‘Religion from
Tolstoy to Camus,’ ‘The
Faith of a Heretic,’’ and his
latest work to date, ‘Hegel:
Reinterpretation, Texts, and
Commentary.’

Results

of the century, said Dechert.

Rather, the increasing abi-
lity of computerized systems
to handle tedious organiza-
tion of social data will en-
able men to move into more
complex community-related
jobs where there will exist
a greater need for personal
contact.

Among other applications
of this cybernation trend,
Dechert sees the possibility
of the increasing personaliza-
tion of education.

He said he believes that
the existence of the improv-
ed data techniques which
are able to provide a wealth
of personal information on
each student wil! make this
personalization possible.

have certain duties, such as
setting the table, cleaning
the house and washing the
dishes. They are socially ma-
ture beyond their age. This
takes some of the load off
us.”"

Their most regular duty is
cooking breakfast. ‘Charlie
worked as a cook last sum
mer,’ said Williams, ‘‘so
he’s pretty good. It's really
hard for me to get up
though, because this is the
first time in four years I've
eaten breakfast regularly.”

Their study time is reduc
ed considerably. “On = an
average night we get to stu
dy about. an hour and a
half,"’ said. Baker. “We try
to make them study as much
as possible too.”

Baker noted one problem
which i8 particularly bad
“One of the guys is a basket.
ball player who is a lot big-
ger than me,”’ he said. Baker
is five feet five.

Mother Williams and
Mother Baker, as they are
affectionately called by the
kids, seem to be quite well
liked. ‘“‘They're okay,” said
one boy. “‘They take us a
lot of places. But they make
us study too much.”’

“They're not too

Voluntary ROT
Passes At Yale

DICK ANDERSON
Asst. Managing Editor

The faculty of Yale Col
lege has recommended to

the Yale Corporation

equivalent to their board of
trustees that ROTC. stu-
dents no longer receive

credit for taking courses in
the program

This recommendation | is
subject to renegotiation with
the Defense Department of
the school’s ROTC contract,

Coeducation Week Devised

To Lure Male Ap

Sarah Lawrence College
will have a  coeducation
week, Feb. 17-22, to give

male guests from other col
leges a chance to learn at
first hand about the style
of" education and special pro
grams at Sarah Lawrence

Invitations have been is-
sued to 20 men’s colleges in
the East, Midwest and South,
asking students to come to
the campus for the week,
attend classes and take part
in social and entertainment
events and discussion
groups.

Sarah Lawrence plans to
accept as. many as 65 to en
ter in September, 1969, Pre-
sident Esther Raushenbush
announced last week. The
deadline for applications
from men has been extend
ed beyond the Feb. 10 limit
for transfer students.

“The experience of the 20
men students who have been
enrolled at the college dur-
ing the past year has shown
that the Sarah Lawrence
style of education is effec.
tive for men as well as
women,"’ Raushenbush said.

“Sarah Lawrence is known
for its emphasis on indivi-
dual curriculum design, with
no required courses, no pre-
requisites and individual

reports in place
grading,

evaluation
of competitive
Raushenbush said.

It is a college of 600 with
small classes and much op
portunity for independent
study. The curriculum in-
cludes the arts as an integral
component, and field work
and community service are
also emphasized.

“The trend toward coedu
cation makes this a most ex.
citing time for education,”
Raushenbush continued, ‘be
cause it opens the gates for
the widest educational op
portunities for men and
women. So far as I know
there is no men's college
with quite the same curri
culum design as Sarah Law-
rence.”

The men students who are
presently enrolled at Sarah
Lawrence, all transfer stu
dents, are studying urban
and community affairs, crea-
tive writing, literature, psy-
chology, physics, music and
chemistry. They previously
studied at Columbia, Am-
herst, Wesleyan, Princeton,
Washington University, Bos-
ton University and City Col-
lege of New York.

Men are not new at Sarah
Lawrence. After Worid War
II men were admitted into

,

licants

the undergratuate program
and since college's early his
tory, men have been gradu-
ate students there. This is
the first time the college has
recruited male applicants.
A recruitment committee,
appointed by the president
and the president of Student
Council, is soliciting applica

Spencer Opens
Gym To STEP.

Regulations on the use of
the college gym have been
modified to allow members
of STEP to use the facilities
in their tutorial work

Members of STEP began a
campaign to gain access to
the gym_ several months
ago. After they carried out
a three-week survey of the
number of people actually
using the gym, President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.
agreed to open the building
to STEP for a one-month
trial period.

of ROTC.

“The primary considera.
tion was practicality,’’ said
Dean John’A. Wilkinson, who
is dean of the undergradu
ate school at Yale. ‘Form
erly we required 40 semest
er courses for the Bachelor's
degree.”

“However, we recently
moved to a requirement of
36 courses,’ Wilkinson con
tinued, ‘and since the Army
requires two courses and the
Navy four, we felt that there
would be no extra hardship
involved for the student.”

Wilkinson said that the re.
evaluation of ROTC credit
was part of a continuing
process of looking at ‘“'pro-
fessional’’ courses, including
some in the Music Depart
ment, the Architecture De
partment, and physical edu
cation.

“ROTC is essentially a pro
fessional course,"’ Wilkinson -
said, ‘‘and after we search
the faculty minutes for 1916,
when our course was first
brought in, we found that
only a slim majority was in
favor of ROTC while a strong
minority objected. for the
same reasons we do today.”’

The faculty resolution al-
so recommended that the
title of professors be taken
away from the ROTC. in-
structors, since these officers
should not have the acade
mic authority associated
with professorships.

ROTC has never been re
quired at Yale.

“ROTC is like singing in
the Whiffenpoofs (the Yale
glee club) a_ perfectly
fine . activity, but one that
we don't think merits any
academic standing,’’ said
Dr. Arthur W. = Galston,
chairman of faculty's course
of study.

The Yale Corporation
usually accepts faculty re-
commendations on the sub-
ject of academics.
