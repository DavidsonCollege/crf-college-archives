Police Charge Two

about parties on campus and asking for
someone named “Cindy.” At one point,
according to Campbell, the man asked if
she and Miller wanted to see his Hallo-
ween mask. He showed them a rubber
face mask, she said.

Campbell and Miller persuaded the
man to leave. When he did, Campbell
locked the door and notified the police.
The man, police allege to be Wardlow,
remained in the hall after leaving the
room, Campbell said. Blackwell re-
turned while police were questioning
Wardlow, according to Campbell.

Police Sergeant Wayne King arrested
Blackwell and Wardlow. According to
campus security officer Johnny Griffith
Blackwell flushed a watch down a toilet
at the Mecklenburg County jail facility.
He said officers discovered two gold
chains hidden in Blackwell’s socks.

Kellam discovered two of her chains
and her watch missing Thursday morn-

( continued from page !)

ing. She identified the chains taken from
Blackwell as her own, Griffith said.

Police reports and witnesses’ ac-
counts allege that Blackwell and
Wardlow had wandered around Knox for
some time before their arrests.

According to sophomore* Laeta
Kalogridis, a first Knox resident, one of
the two attempted to enter her room after
she had encountered them in the hall be-
tween I and 1:30 a.m. She said he re-
peatedly requested to talk with her. Fi-
nally, she told him “no, and goodnight,”
according to the statement she gave the
police.

Then, Kalogridis said, “I didn’t call
the police, [which is] about the most
idiotic thing I’ve ever done in my David-
son career.” She said she heard the two
talk with others in the hall for about 30
minutes, at times making sexually
suggestive remarks about “Davidson
girls.” .

Symposium To Study MRT

(continued from page !)

Imaging process. According to Brock-
way, X-rays operate on a density princi-
ple, in which the thickest parts of the
body absorb the greatest radiation and
appear most clearly, Brockway said.

Thus, thin objects such as body tis-
sues appear faintly on X-rays. Instead,
he said, Magnetic Resonance Imaging
operates by manipulating the body’s hy-
drogen protons. These protons rotate,
creating an electro-magnetic field. The
MRI process sends a radio wave through
the body to knock the protons out of their
electro-magnetic field, according to
Brockway, and obtains a picture of the
object by gauging the response of the
electrons.

The MRI process, Brockway said, 1s
“very new.” Though he said the technol-
ogy was introduced in the mid-1970s,
and companies such as IBM, G. E. and
Inter-Magnetics produce and develop it,
the only Magnetic Resonance scanners
now available for use by patients is at
Charlotte Memorial Hospital.

Director of Nuclear Medicine at
Charlotte Memorial Hospital Dr. Ed-
ward J. Gaston will give the second lec-
ture concerning the practical applications
of the MRI technology.

After a reception and dinner from
5:30 p.m. to 7:15 p.m., the symposium
will resume with a lecture by economics
Professor John Rapoportat from Mount
Holyoke College. He will address the
economics of advanced technology in
medicine. According to Brockway, the
use of MRI “isn’t very wide-spread be-
cause they are so expensive.”

He said a small Magnetic Resonance
scanner costs between $900,000 and
$1.1 million, and a large one costs ap-
proximately $2.5 million. Constructing a
room to house the complex apparatus it-
self, Brockway said, costs between
$500,000 and $1 million. Though a
single MRI picture costs approximately
$400, as opposed to $25 for a regular X-
ray, Brockway said an MRI picture’s
value exceeds the price. For a serious in-
jury, he said “its not a question of choos-
ing between one or the other. Even for
people who don’t have the money, it’s no
question.”

The final lecture, beginning at 8:15
p.m., will feature Davidson philosophy
Professor Lance Stell addressing
“Biotechnology and Bioethics.” The
issue of MRI, he said, provides the occa-
sion to “examine the way in which tech-
nological knowledge can raise moral
questions.”

Many people, he said, can feel
threatened by the “supernatural” tools of
medical technology. It can increase pub-
lic perception, he said, that “the control
of our destiny is slipping away.” How-
ever, he noted a “heartening” tendency
among today’s doctors to consult with
patients and be responsive to their
wishes.

The symposium is the third in a series
of six presented by Davidson’s “New
Liberal Arts Program” which began in
1982 with a $250,000 grant from the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation . The sym-
posium is open free of charge.

Sophomore Allison Gabay told
police a black male opened her door
twice between 1:30 and 2 a.m. Accord-
ing to her statement, Gabay asked the
man what he wanted. He told her, she
said, he was looking for a student named
Cindy Travis. She told him that no one
by that name lived in the dorm. After the
man left, according to her statement,
Gabay looked unsuccessfully for Travis
in the directory.

Around 11 p.m. Wednesday, sopho-
mores Dan Simonds and Dave Turgeon
encountered a “suspicious looking guy”
outside Knox dorm, according to Tur-
geon.

Turgeon said the man was leaving
Knox with a box radio. He said they did
not know the man and had not seen him
around campus. Turgeon said they ques-
tioned him, but “everything he said we
knew he was lying through his teeth.”

As the man left, Turgeon and

Simonds followed him, Turgeon said.
the man began to run when he noticed the
students behind him. Turgeon said he
and Simonds chased the man into the
trees behind Fannie & Mabble, where
they lost him.

They recovered the radio, Turgeon
said, and reported the incident to secu-
rity. Turgeon said they located the owner
of the radio in Knox Dorm.

Police have not linked that incident to
Blackwell and Wardlow.

Kellam said she would start locking
her door. “T think that people here think
they live in a security haven,” she said. “I
hate that it took this to make me start
locking my door.” She added that only
one other resident was present on her sec-
ond Knox hall during the time her room
had been entered. ‘Anything could have
happened, and no one would have known
about it,” she said.
