College Matters Discussed With
Educational Experts .

Despite the fact that President Wil-
son is exceedingly bus¥ at this time,
owing to the critical situation in Mex-
ico. and the question of the repeal of
the Canal Tolls, which among many
other important matters, are requiring
his close attention just, now,. President
Martin, through the kindness of Senator
Overman, succeeded in securing a short
interview with the President on last
Thursday, March 26.

After waiting for about. thirty min-
utes, President Martin» was - cordially
greeted by Mr. Wilson, who laid aside
heavier matters of State to recall. pleas-
antly for a few moments his college days
at Davidson and to enquire about the in-
stitution as it is at present. He spoke
of President Martin’s father, whom he
‘familiarly called “Colonel” Martin and
of his two sons, showing that he still
intimately recalled even the small mat-
ters. of his college days. He also ex-
pressed regret that ill health had com-
pelled his withdrawal from Davidson
at the end of his freshman year. - This
is a’ clear explanation of the:facts,<on-:
nected. with his leaving, which is a
matter that has not been fully. under-
stood by every’ one béfore. After a
word about Mrs. Wilson’s brother, Pro-

also a Davidson Freshman and a class-
mate of President Martin, a hearty
handshake and a miitual expression of
good wishes, the' visit was over.

) It was only a short interview, but
characterized by directness, simplicity
and _ cordiality. | President Martin, ‘in
speaking of Mr. Wilson, said: “Mr.
Wilson is to me better looking than his
pictures, though they: are. exceedingly
like him.. He gives you the impression
of strength, with much of it held in
reserve.”

Interview With Vice-President
Marshall | {

By invitation, President Martin join-| Coff

ed the Charlotte: delegation which called
upon Vice-President Marshall, and. in-
vited him to speak at the celebration of
the one hundred: and thirty-ninth anni-
versary of the signing of the Mecklen-
burg Declaration of Independence, on
May 20.. Among those in. the’ party
were United States Senator Overman,
Secretary of Navy Pech, and Con-
gressman Webb. Mr. Marshall met
the delegation in the Vice-President’s
room:in the Capitol, where in an, infor-
mal way the invitation was extended,
first by Secretary Daniels, who stood
up for the Mecklenburg, Declaration
and the 20th of May in great shape.
then by each of the party in turn, as it
was only by their combined efforts that
his acceptance was secured. But the
matter was finally clinched hay of
.. the arguments. used by President Mar-
_ tin. was that the Commencement: Ex-.
ercises of Davidson would close on the
night of May 19 and that the student
body and commencement visitors would
be present in rlotte in large num-
bers to greet and hear him. After the
interview with the Vice!President, the
party accepted the invitation of Secre-
tary Daniels to lunch at the Army and
Nevy Club, where they had both a fine
1 pate and a good time.

Games for Coming Week

April 1—Guilford at Davidson.

April 3—Trinity at Davidson.

April 8—Trinity at Durham.

Hak-a-rak-a-boom-a-lack! The base
ball season has been ushered in, and dur-
ing the past few days the Varsity has
been daily getting in better shape, and
Coach Cook is satisfied that the Red
and Black Machine will come out on
top ere the season has closed. The games
so far have shown that the only thing
lacking is good, consistent, timely hit-
ting, and Coach has_ been devoting
more time to this part of practice than
previously. The fielding has been above
par, particularly that of the infield.

In the Oak. Ridge game Davidson
outplaved. them=at every stage of the
‘game, but simple Kad. no luck. Several
tisky-chances: were taken on bases that
would, have been safe if the field had
not been wet. It is true that Mayberry
certainly had a<good bunch of players,
and they all had good wings. . The
Buffalo Leaguers did not come up -be-
cause, of inclement weather. Too bad
we didn’t get a chance to defeat them.

he: same is true of Gastonia game.

Trinity Series.

By next Wednesday Davidson’ will
have played three games with the strong
Methodist team from the “Bull” City.
From the games they have already
plaved and the “dope” that can be gath-
ered, they have a far better team than
they had last year. They have a fast
fielding and good hitting team. On
March 25, in their games with William
and Mary, they simply walked over this
strong team to the tune of 10 too. On
the day following the University of
North Carolina only defeated this same
team_I too. On the next day, March
26, Trinity lost to the University of
ermont 2 to 0, on poor base running.
although outplaying -that. team. On
March 28 Trinity walloped the Baptist
14 to 2.

Now the team will have to Zo some
to beat this strong bunch of players. But
Davidson can do it. Plenty Pep is the
word! When plaving them on the Hill
let every student come out and back up
the Red and Black Machine; ves, “root,
root, root, for the home team!” and they
can’t help but win.

The following men were taken to
Gastonia to play Trinity: Stough, Cray-
ton, Watkins, Witherington, Somer-
ville, Osteen, Currie, Anderson, Pa:
nella, Kluttz, Keesler, Walker, Chris-
tenbury, Manager Roberson, Assistant
Manager Malloy and Coach Cook..

CAROLINA CANCELS.

The University of North Carolina
manager has just wired Manager Rob-
erson that the game that was to be
plaxed in Charlotte on’ April 21 will
ave to be cancelled, as they have too
‘many games off their Hill already. The
Davidson manager says that he is al-

most certain that he can arrange another
game with them for some day in Aprii.
