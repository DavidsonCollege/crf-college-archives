THE DAVIDSONIAN — OPINIONS MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1993 7

A Few Last Words ~. . Unless
Something Really Big Happens

When first began writing this
column, I wasasked to write mostly
for a freshman audience. I was a
little unsure about the overall tenor
I wanted to project. While I felt a
real need to discuss aspects of the
College deserving of scrutiny, I
wanted to avoid the negativity that
is the hallmark of too many publi-
cations of all kinds. Another fear,
and one which proved to be un-
founded, was that I would run out
of things to discuss. A person
could make a life-long career out
of responding to the events which
transpire on this campus.

I guess I expected a lot of
things when I began writing for
this paper—some of those expec-
tations have come to fruition and
others have not. I’ve always tried
to focus on the things with which I
was involved, and perhaps one
thing I did not expect was my
eventual tiring of wanting to dis-
cuss those things atall. After serv-
ing on committees searching for
answers to inflammatory ques-
tions—issues like the alcohol
policy, or race and gender rela-

tions, or the direction of Patterson
Court, or admissions recruiting
goals, or more broadly, just how
much influencecollege authorities
ought to have over their students in
the early 1990’s—well, after all
that, I’ve decided that I’ve said my
piece.::It?s time for another per-
spective, for someone else to write
about the issues facing Davidson
students, and I have a feeling Aléx
Crumbley will do that and more.
The transition in the Editorial Board
provides a good jumping-off place
for me. In this last column, I am

taking advantage of one last chance
to go on the record ona few dispar-
ate issues.

On Patterson Court:

Last week, Kirby Shealy wrote
in Deep Thoughts his belief that
Patterson Court ought to remove

itself from the business of food
service. The houses on the Court
would exist as many fraternities
and sororities accross the nation
do—as social clubs. Parties, ser-
vice projects, and overall intra-
house interaction would remain
unchanged, but students would eat

_with other students, regardléss of

social affiliation. I think it’s a
wonderful idea, and one whose
time has come, for it affords stu-
dents the opportunity to socialize
with friends who may not share the
same social affiliation, much less
the same gender. And for those

In Black and White...

What Constitutes Being

Pretend you’re a stranger on
campus and you’re people-watch-
ing in the Union. You see two
groups: the members of one group
are all white, except for one who is
black. The black per-

dialects. Not all of them are going
to hang out exclusively with black
people.

The problem is that people in
general, including Davidson folks,

who want to eat en masse with
their brothers or fellow eating house
members, a Commons-type atmo-
sphere provides ample right and
room to do so. To that end, I don’t
buy the argument that house unity
would suffer; rather, as Kirby
pointed out, houses potentially
would have to deal less with apa-
thy and rampant absenses from
meetings. Kirby is on to a good
idea, and one with which most
house members would probably
agree, except for maybe the sopho-
moremembersof houses, for whom
everything is oy new and won-
derful.

It seems patently obvious to
me that Patterson Court needs to
try something new. I need only
point to the standing room success
stories of Back Street and the Pub
to demonstrate that the Court is no
longer the pre-eminent social at-
traction at Davidson, which it un-
deniably was my freshman and
sophomore years. The idea Kirby
articulated last week is aleast worth
considering, and if it’s wrong in
the minds ofa majority of students,
I hope someone else will publish
another innovative idea.

On Religion:

Last year, I wrote in one of :

these columns that DCPC failed to
attract many College students. I
was on the CCRL at the time, and
I’ve always regretted not making
that belief more of an issue. In my
mind,an 11:00a.m.churchservice
for which people are expected to
dress up is not much of an alterna-

tive to sleeping late and driving to

blacks and whites alike. Those

who go to a pre-

son, by his clothing,
manner of speech, and
interests, seems to fitin
with the rest of the
group. The members
of the second group are
all black. Is your reac-
tion to the black person
in the mostly-white
group different from
your reaction to the
black people in the all-
black group?

The goal of this
scenario is to bring up
the question of what

Guilty Before

By Marilyn Ambroise

What does the judiciary sys-
tem have to offer African-Ameri-
cans? For many, namely, African-
Americans, this is not a rhetorical
question. Upon the results of sev-
eral cases that involved African-
Americans, chaos evolved about
the justice system. African-Ameri-
cans are not really sure about what
the justice system has to offerthem.

Yes, of course, African-
Americans are educated, too! They
know what is stated in the United
States Consti-

Caucasian Americans? Ideally, I
would like to answer “‘yes” to the
former serious questions, but real-
istically, I cannot.

The most recent and national
evidence that I have to support my
argument is the Rodney King inci-
dent. In this situation, (for those of
you don’t know), an African-
Amcrican was beaten by Cauca-
sian policemen whoclaim thatthere
was no alternative to the beating.
The beating was video-taped by a
Samaritan, and for months you

written with the equal consider-
ation of African-Americans. In-
deed, the words were chose very
carefully by the forefathers of this
country to suggest the inclusion of
African-Amcricans, but past and
current evidence has shown other-
wise.

Yet another example is the
“The Pledge of Allegiance” which
reads, “I pledge allegiance to the
flag of the United States of America
and to the republic for which it
stands, one nation, under God, in-
divisible, with liberty and justice
forall.” Liberty and justice for all?

Who are we
trying to fool here?! Were Afri-

the policemen were acquitted.

Of course, there were many
Caucasian males and females who
tried to justify the verdict. Iam not
surprised because these are the
same individuals who warm their
children of “big black men.” And
these are the same type people who
were on the jury. The only thing is

that they were not selected for jury
duty.

My point is that just becausc
we have a constitution that uscs
idealistic words, and a justice sys-
tem that is sct up in an idcalistic
fashion, does not guarantec Afri-
can-Americans anything. Keep in
mind that the judge in the case was
a person before he came a judge;

I was sure that the backbone of the

because it would break tradition
and decrease unit pride and mo-
rale. But then remembered some-
thing I had heard years ago.

I was transported back to first
grade, Shorecrest School, 1980. I
recalled lots of voices, reciting in
unison: “T pledge allegiance to the
flag, of the United States of
America . . . one country ...
indivisible . . . with liberty and
justice for all.” For all. Period.
Remember the pledge? It’s what
most of us were brought up saying.
It’s what we learned, and it seems
like it’s what we’ ve forgotten. Not
just for whites or blacks. Not just
for males or females. Not just for
heterosexuals. For all.

So I can’t tell you that we
shouldn’t have homosexuals in our
military. Ir doesn’t make sense.
