Community Almost Doubles
Its $1,000 Goal

The Community of Davidson al-
most doubled the goal set by con-
tributing $1,800 to the National War.
Fund drive held here during the
past two wecks.

Davidson students, caught rather
hard-pressed after the Home-com-
ing week-end, gave $80.00. The
drive is still going on, and more con-
tributions are expected.

The National War Fund makes it
possible to support seventeen sepa-

rate War and Relief agencies in one
big drive, eliminating the necessity
of numerous small solicitijigs that
only tend to get in the way and in-
fluence people against drives in
general. :

The contributions will be distri-
buted among the following organi-

_ zations: War Prisoners’ Aid, Unit-

’ War

ed” China” Relief,” United” Service
Organizations, Greek War Relief,
“Russian War Relief, French War
Relief, Belgian War Relief, Polish
Relief, - Queen Wilhelmina
Fund,
Seaman's Service, Czechoslovak Re-
lief Fund, United Yugoslav Relief
Fund, Refugee Relief Trustees, U.
S. Commission of Care of Europ-
ean. Children, and Friends of Lux-
embourg.

These many deserving relief funds
must be met by the American peo-
ple, who alone are in a position to
do so.

~ Visit To

By CLAYTON SCOFIELD

Holding our food like men, we
tripped down to the local cinema
last night, eyes shining in anticipa-
tion of the colossal production on.
We stalked up to the box office,
planked down thirty cents, ($.30),
and stumbled into the semidark-
ness, hoping to find a seat on some
polished board.

Lightning flashes across the
screen; black bats flutter hither and
yon. A lone mansion appears on
a far -off hill. Rain beats down on
a lonely figure, in the foreground
of the desolate scene, who gazes
hopefully at the, darkened house.

The noise of the rain, lightning,
bats, and dramatic music- suddenly
stop to allow an ear-splitting scream
to pierce the silence. The light-

see the door swing inward away
from his sinewy hand.

He walks in, and looks up into the
face of an enormous butler (always
played by Boris Karloff) who stares
ominously down his hawk nose at
our hero. The door suddenly slams
shut; our heto snaps around with
gun drawn. Quick as a flash, he
whips back, but the butler has dis-
appeared.

Our hero advances to the foot of
a large staircase, and noiselessly as-
cends--the stairs, which branch into
two separate cases. Stairs to the
right, stairs to the left. Between
the staircases he notices a huge
