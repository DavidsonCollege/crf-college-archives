NUMBER 21

Students hold minors forum;

By CATHERINE ANDERSON
News Editor

Wednesday afternoon,
students and two faculty
members gathered in the 900
Room for an open discus-
sion on the issue of minors.
“T thought that the students

were extremely supportive,
and I was very disappointed
that more faculty didn’t show
up, especially considering
Warren’ s invitation the week
before at the faculty meet-
ing, and also considering the
fact that we called a number
of them and posted flyers

just about everywhere in
Chambers. We were a little
disappointed that they didn’t
show more interest in our
efforts,” says Junior Liz
Abernathy, Council of Aca-
demic: Affairs Co-chair.

“T think the interaction
between students went well,”

says Rick Onkey. “We were
trying to create a contact
between students and fac-
ulty, but since only two fac-
ulty showed up, that was dis-
appointing.”

SGA President Warren
Buford agrees. “I think it
wentreally well. It was great

to see so many students who
had a vested interest in bring-

ing minors to Davidson, and /
students who brought unan- >

swered questions [to the fo-
rum]. I wish a larger group
had been there to listen,” he
says. “I hope it helps,” he
adds, :

“The forum proved that
students need to continue ap-
proaching faculty ... It’s
[now] going to come down
on our efforts and energy,”
says SGA Vice Pres. Clair
Freeman.

For all students, recent changes in
the college atmosphere have made
Davidson more accepting . The Self-
Study on the Student Experience,
though, cites many areas in need of
improvement, especially in those con-

homosexuality.

The Self-Study states that in 1990-
1991, there “were acts of homophobic
intolerance directed towards openly gay

activities apart
from Patterson Court, an integration of
courses which deal with the issues of
human sexuality into the curriculum,
more public forums dealing with is-
sues of human sexuality, and the en-
couragement of religious organizations
to address forthrightly their views on

included death threats, food throwing,
and the writing of homophobic graffiti
on posters in Chambers.

Since then, the creation of the stu-
dent organization, Friends of Lesbians
and Gays (FLAG) has greatly promoted

open-mindedness towards issues of
sexuality. FLAG’s Sexuality Forum
and successful fashion shows have
helped heighten awareness about the ©
presence of gay students and has nur-
tured a sensitivity between people of
any sexual persuasion.

“Move Along — It’s
only a Penis!” read one of
the protestor’s signs in front
of Charlotte Repertory
Wednesday night. A group
of 150 protestors marched
the streets in support of An-
gels in America, the contro-
versial play by Tony
Kushner. Loudly chanting
protests, 12 Davidson stu-
dents joined the march with
signs blazoned with every-
thing from “Thank God for
Angels” to “Clip the Right
Wing.”

The controversy began
with Reverend Joe Cham-

GUAR

bers, who has previously at-
tacked Barney the Dinosaur
for being a bad role model
for children. Chambers and
his followers, the Concerned
Charlotteans, object to a
nude scene in the play and
believe the play’s subject
matter to be offensive. His
preachings have stirred up
the Charlotte community and
caused a flurry of letters to
the Charlotte Observer for
and against Angels in
America.

Also, Chambers has ac-
cused the play of breaking
North Carolina’s indecent
exposure law. This plea re-
sulted in the threat of the
police arresting the actor if

Because of the contro-

Wednesday to pull the play
if the scene was performed
as written. The actors man-
aged to receive an injunc-
tion that would protect them
from arrest for ten days, af-
ter which they would dis-
cuss the matterin court. With
this protection, the actors

Citing his plans to retire

Bachelor’s degree in Psy-

sor of Psychology in 1959.

Kelton says that it was
the “heavy demands of the
Campaign for Davidson”
which increased the
Assistant’s representative
role, thus allowing
Kuykendall more flexibil-
ity in his schedule.

As the Executive As-
sistant, Kelton represents the
President’ s Office on a host
of various internal and ex-
ternal committees and coun-
cils. He also “coordinates
meetings and activities of
the Board of Trustees,”
“serves as liaison to the
Southern Association of
Colleges and Schools,” and
“performs other duties and
functions as assigned by the
President,” this according to
the official job description.

In short, Kelton has
acted as the right-hand man
of the president. “Or left, I
don’t know,” he adds,
chuckling.

Asked if he advises the
president, Kelton re-
sponded, “T tell him what I
think, yeah,” but he was
quick to point out that the
job is not part of a hierarchy
which places him between
the president and others. “I
