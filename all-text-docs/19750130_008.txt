As Midwinters Takes Its Toll

By MARK SCANDLING
Staff Writer

The Wildcat Wrestling. Team
went. through an extremely

** : demanding schedule in the past

week. The team had four mat-
ches, and emerged as victors in
only one.

The team defeated Lynch-

-burg Baptist College. .The

wrestlers fell to Campbell
College, VMI, and the Citadel.
The team’s record is now 2 and
5.

Campbell 34-- Davidson 15

Davidson made the long trip
to Buies Creek to meet last
year’s NAIA Division 7 cham-
pions. The Cats managed to win
only three matches against
Campbell.

Mike Dosal picked up a forfeit
at 118, and then wrestled an
exhibition match, which he won
14-4.

Mark Scandling won his 150
Ib. clash by the score of 8-4, and
Jack Summe pinned Camp-
bell’s 300 lb. heavyweight.

Both Glenn Ballard and Rob
Jacobs wrestled in close mat-
ches, only to end up on the short
end of the score.

VMI 24-- Davidson 15

The wrestling team spent Mid-
Winters at VMI. In the first of
three matches last Saturday af-
ternoon, the Cats dropped a
close match to VMI.

Brion Jacobs penned his op-
ponent, and then Jack Ballard
and Rob Jacobs followed him

Since F’'m writing this article

huge difference, but still not
enough to dethrone the
Gozinyas. With or without Com-

with wins. The string of vic-
tories put Davidson ahead 12-3.

Mike Smith was pinned in the
177 lb. clash, but Bob Bennett
kept Davidson’s hopes alive
when he won an 8-7 decision

Jack Summe was pinned by
VMi’s buzzsaw in the unlimited
match, and Davidson fell to its
fourth defeat.

Coach Parker felt the Cats
should have won the match, and
he pointed out the crucial mat-
ches were 150, 158, and 167.

The losses in these weights
doomed the Cats.

Mark Scandling lost his first
match of the year by a score of
8-6. Bob Price and Ralph
Holloway lost one_ point
decisions and VMI tied the
score at 12 all.

had a 24-7 lead.

This lead was cut to 24-19, as
both Mike Smith and Bob Ben-
hett were pinned.

Jack Summe picked up a 4-2
decision to save the victory for
the Wildcats.

The Citadel 40-- Davidson 0

The third match of the day
was a disaster for the Cats. The
Cats were shut out for the first
time in fifteen years.

Captain Rob Jacobs termed
this match ‘‘as one to forget’’.

The grapplers take on the
Catamounts of Western
Carolina University tonight at
7:00 in Johnston Gym.

Coach Parker is hoping to win
the final four matches of the
year and end up with a winning
record. Parker feels that
“strong performances could
make the goal possible’’.
Tonight will be the first test.
