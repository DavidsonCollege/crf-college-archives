Graduat
beats othe

By ANN GARNER

Ah, yes, graduation. Pres-
ently., it looms over our heads
as the culmination of our
halcyon undergraduate days.
Yet, the aura of the new
graduate must fade as he faces
the inevitability of the future
with two alternatives: finding
a job or delving deeper into the
realms of academia in grad-
uate school. -

Many graduates feel that
their experiences in extracurr-
icular activities was the most
advantageous aspect of com-
ing to Davidson.

“Of course there was a
compromise, for Davidson
cannot offer a vast selection of
courses,’’ said Mark Deaton
"76. “But I figured that I
could do more there with a
greater access to different
organizations.”’

Deaton, after attending the
University of California at

Berkeley for ten months on a.

Rockefeller fellowship, is now

“There were a lot of juxta-
positions at Berkeley from
Davidson. Yet, I had prepared
myself well for Berkeley in
that through my courses and
work on The Davidsonian, I
learned to write and organize
my thoughts well.

The development of writing
skills also proved to be advan-
tageous for John MacArthur

legislative correspondent for
Senator Heinz in Washington,
D.C.

“One of the most important
things is to come out of school
with some degree of confidence
in your ability to express
yourself well on paper. It was
a pre-requisite for my job.”’

John Munce ’'76 echoed
these sentiments: ‘‘Let’s face

it, a diploma is just a pieced of
paper. What I did at Davidson
was to develop my speaking
and writing skills and my
understanding of the way
institutions work.”’

there,” Munce added. ‘From
then on, I have had to
translate my experiences there
to what I do now.”

Woods advises iIntrormation
gathering, not job hunting

By CATHERINE LANDIS
Editor
Want a job? It’s not easy.
According to Ken Wood, Dir-

After Davidson

ector of Experiential Prog-
rams and placement, the most
important thing students
should do is start early.

Wood's philosophy is stu-
dents should divorce job hun-
ting from information gather-
ing. He says, “‘Too many
students are uptight about
making a decision about these
careers. First they should
think of things which excite
them, look at what they have
enjoyed in the past.”

“The first jobs out of Dav-
idson will be determined by
enthusiasm and _ interest.
That’s how careers get built,’’
he continues.

Wood believes a student
should start thinking about
his career before he becomes a
senior. He suggests extern

means toward decision-mak-
ing and gaining contacts.

Along with experience,
Wood adds information gath-
ering to. the process of getting
a job. ‘‘Identifying the per-
sons who will hire you,”’ he
says. ‘‘Find out as much as
you can about the organiza-
tion'so you can show them
how you can help them.”’

Wood feels the resume is the
least important part of the
process. He suggests a propo-
sal rather than a resume.
“What it shows is you’ve done
your homework.”

He concludes, ‘“Talk to peo-
ple who are doing interesting
things. Don’t ask the typical
questions about the job mar-
ket, what’s available, etc, Ask

and internship programs as_ the question, ‘What do I
well as summer jobs as a_ want?’”’
Grad schools cut applicant numbers
By CATHERINE LANDIS So how does one get into graduate scholarship or financial aid. sure you follow directions carefully.
Editor school? Hight outlines a seven-point 2. DETERMINE to which schools Some universities require recommen-

It is not as easy to get into
graduate school as it used to be
according to Dr. William Hight,
Student Counselor. He says, because
there are so many students applying,
most graduate schools are doing one
of two things:

1. Restricting initial admission, or
2. Letting students enter, then letting
them knock each other out.

“Graduate schools just don’t want
to be caught with a large number of
Ph.D.’s that they can’t get rid of
because of the lack of jobs,’”’ Hight
says.

«Hight cites one example of the top
job market. Last year the Davidson
english department advertised an
opening. They received 300 applica-
tions. One member of the department
said that ten years ago the depart-
ment could have thrown out 275 of
those applications. Last year, how-
ever, 295 were really qualified.

“I'm as pessimistic as I can be so
the student will know what he’s up
against,’ High comments. ‘‘But if a
student really wants to go, I say go
ahead.”’ Hight’s policy is to present
the facts, then let the student make
am hie own mind.

procedure:

1. DECIDE whether you want to go
to graduate school. This includes an
evaluation of whether you are a
competitive student or not and whe-
ther or not you can afford it. If you
cannot afford it you must determine
whether or not you could qualify for a

you would like to apply. Find out as
much as you can about those schools
by talking to people in the program,
reading the catalogues, reviewing the
application process.

3. WRITE the university for an

dations, some prefer not to receive
them; some desire an interview,
others are bothered by one, etc. If the
university requires recommendations,
rake a list of those whom you ask. If
the university loses one, you will
know whom you asked.
5. TAKE the appropriate tests (test-
‘ing registration forms and informa-
tion are in Dr. Hight’s office.
For a Ph.D.—GRE

IF the university looks favorably
n an interview, set up an appoint-
nent. Medical schools, for instance,
rely heavily on it; most law schools do
not. Go into an interview with at least
two good questions to separate your-
self from the mass of applications.
7. WAIT.

Dr. Hight feels getting into grad-
uate school is an individual matter. ‘‘I
don't think any one school has
absolute standards for admissions.
They look at the package."

He continues, ‘Students may have
to do a little more searching now that
those did in the past. But life is worth
a little reflection.and research ”’
