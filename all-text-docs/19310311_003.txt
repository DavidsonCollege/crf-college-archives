MEET TO BE HERE

Charlotte is Expected to Bring
Well-Trained Team

The Wildcat. cindermen will combine
forces with the Wildkittens in a pre-season
meet with Charlotte High Saturday after-
noon at Richardson Field. All three teams
will probably take advantage of this com-
petition to feel men out and find out the
best combinations of strength. It is known
that Charlotte has a powerful track team,
both from last year’s left-overs and new ma-
terial this year. Coach Galen Elliot has had
them out getting into shape for about four
weeks already and they are showing quite
good form for this early in the season.

Captain Pritchett will have his varsity
squad in fair shape by that time as a ma-
jority of the varsity men have been out for
over two weeks. The sprinting department
is in good shape for this early in the season
as they have already been in one meet at
the Tin Can at Carolina. Fleagle, McCail and
Kuykendall will probably enter the 100 for
the varsity, while Fleagle, Kuykendall, and
McCallie or Little will enter the 220. The
high and low hurdles will have George, Little
and McCallie taking care of them. McGe-
hee will run in the 440 and ‘possibly Mc-
Callie. Neal, Drake and Gwyn will enter
the 880, while Earle and Howard will more
than likely run the mile. Brannon and Mur-
phy will be in the two-mile.

In the weight department, there will be
Boyle, Knox, and Bost in the shot put; Hall,
Bettis and possibly another will be in the
discus throw. McCall, McCullough and Can-
non will take care of the javelin throw. The
Wildcats will be represented in the high
jump by George, Allen, McKinnon and Bet-
tis; in the broad jump there will be Mc-
Call, George, and possibly Flinn. The pole
vault will be entered by Roane, Stroud, and
possibly Flinn.

The Freshmen seem to be strong in the
sprints and distances only. They have Haly-
burton, McMillen, Moffett and Davies for
the shorter distances. Morrow, Woodside
and Drake seem to be showing up better in
the long distances. Nothing is known about
the field men as none have shown up yet.
One of the purposes of this early meet is
to show up just such material as is needed.
Gilmer, however, looks as if he will develop
into a good pole vaulter in the future. Out-
side of him not much Freshman material
has shown up in the field division.

Many Men Try Out
For Freshman Nine

For the past three weeks the crack of
wood meeting leather has been consistently
heard around the athletic field, and many
aspirants to the Freshman baseball team
have been noted. Coach Laird has devoted
his time largely in attempting to determine
what positions the men are most capable

Spring Practice Closes

The end of the football game last
Saturday brought to a close all foot-
ball practice for the fiscal school
year, and all uniforms and equip:
ment have been cleaned and stored
away for early practice next year.
In spite of unfavorable weather
conditions, spring practice this year
has been unusually strenuous, with
the result that reorganization at the
beginning, of next fall will be made
easier. itis expected that fall prac-
tice will begin the latter part of
August or the first of next Septem-
ber.

Reds and Blacks Tie
In Final Grid Game

Spring football training was brought to a
close at Davidson College Friday afternoon,
when the Blacks played the Reds to a 7-7
deadlock. The contest was featured by the
unusual uphill fight displayed by the Blacks,
who were considered the underdogs, to end
the game in a tie.

The Reds were the first to score. Their
marker came in the second quarter when
Don McQueen intercepted a forward pass
by King and by ‘some shifty running raced
45 yards for a touchdown. McQueen also
place-kicked the point after touchdown. The
Blacks tallied in the third period, when King
broke loose on a 30-yard sprint around left
end, after the Blacks had recovered a Red
fumble. Tjhe extra point was kicked by King.
Another threat by the Reds was_a 44-yard
drive which ended on their opponents’ 24-
yard line, when the Blacks put up a stubborn
defense.

McQueen of the Reds and King of the
Blacks were the outstanding performers, with
Micky Bradshaw and Buddy Gardner also
doing some spectacular work. Rieves, Red
guard, also showed up well.

to fill, but as yet not even a tentative line-up
is available.

The usual scarcity of pitchers is not as
prevalent as in former years, though no un-
usual material has as yet been discovered.
Koonce, Hudspeth, and Lineberry are show-
ing up best, while Holland, Sneed, Burks,

Varsity Baseball Team
Taking Daily Workouts

Lack of Experienced Pitchers Will
Be Greatly Felt by This Year’s
Team

Although varsity baseball practice has pro-
gressed well into its third week of activity,
Coach “Monk Younger isn’t taking any
chances ef losing any of his players because
of sore arms; under no circumstances has
he allowed any of the baseball aspirants to
cut loose with any hard balls, especially is
this true of the pitchers who as yet are not
doing much more than lobbing the ball to
the catcher.

Hitting practice has been in progress now
a little over a week with all of the pitchers
seeing action by merely tossing the old pill
over the plate as easy as possible and letting
the batter hit it as far as he may. Each
pitcher throws to about five or six batters

and is then relieved by some other aspir-
ing pitcher; this is done that one man might |
not tire his arm so early in the season,

As yet there has been no infield practice
Coach Younger is giving the infielders plenty
of exercise before he turns them loose on
the diamond to chase grounders. However,
the outfiglders have been. put to it rather |
hard,. for Coach “Monk” is limbering up |
his pitchers by letting them knock out flys |
to the outer garden.

As was predicted some time ago, David- |
son’s weakness this year will be in-the pitch- |
ing staff, as last year’s two outstanding pitch-
ers, Kugler and MelInniss, graduated last |
spritg. The team this year will have an |
abundance of southpaws in ‘Thompson, |
Pearce, and Baily. Last year Thompson suf- |
fered the entire year with a sore arm, but}
he hopes to be able to use it to advantage |
this season, as he gave it a rest during the |
entire summer. In Pearce, Coach Younger
has a pitcher who has plenty of¢ontrol and
has a good fast ball, although he had hard |
luck in the games he pitched last season,
he should develop into a very good pitcher, |
Baily, the third member of the left-handers, |
has a tendency to wildness, and last year this |

caused him no little trouble, but if the can | ;

overcome this handicap he will probably see
some action this season. Probably the most
outstanding right-handers on the squad are
Croker and Cathey. Croker did very little |
pitching last year, but should see some serv-
ice this season. Cathey, pitched here some |
years ago, but did not make a letter. He |
has a good delivery and seems to have plenty
of control and he will probably do some
pitching this year.

As there has been no infield practice held
as yet, it is very difficult to say who will
play these positions, but without doubt Cap-
tain Armfield will hold down the catcher’s
job with Proctor at first base, Goodson on
second. In the shortstop position there are
three men available in Bernhardt and Mc-|
Millan, both lettermen of last year, and |
Mills. In all probability Bernhardt will be |
shifted to third base, leaving Mills and Me-|

Saturday will give Davidson fol-
their first chance to see the Da-
track teams, both freshmen and
in action. In fact, the meet here
will open the spring sports scheduled on

vidson
varsity,

the campus, and be just another sign that
spring is just around the corner. (It cer-
tainly is a long way to the turn, how-
ever.)

Charlotte High School, the third mem-
ber of the trio of teams which compete

lhere this week-end, is this year as strong
las usual, from all advance notices.
Queen City boys always boast one of the

did the meet Saturday will be far from a
walk-off for the varsity. It was carded
primarily as a warm-up engagement for
both the regulars and the yearlings, and
should answer admirably to this purpose.

Dean S. V. Sanford, the speaker for
the Athletic Night program, is one of the
outstanding authorities on athletics in the
South. He is one of the founders of the
Southern Conference and presided over
the body for ten years as president. He
is at present a member of the executive
committee of the National Collegiate Ath-
letic Association, and is activély connected
with athletics at the University of Geor-
gia. The Athletic department is indeed for:

| Millan at short. Of these two Mills is the

faster and he is also a good hitter, but Mc-

| Millan is probably his equal when it comes

to fielding. Both of these: men will see serv-
ce,

In the outfield Covington and, Mathis are
looking good, as is Bradsher, who played
with the Freshmen last season. J. G. Mor-
rison, and his brother, J. D., are also show
ing up well out in the gardens.

Pepper games are still in) progress and
are being used mostly for limbering up pur-
poses, but there is a great deal of interest

jin this part of the.sport. Sliding practice

is also being carried on and before long we
won't surprised to hear of a practice
game in progress.

be

tunate to secure such a man for the ex-
ercise Tuesday.

The program includes, besides Dr. San-
ford’s address, the award of certificates
to lettermen in football, wrestling, and
basketball, and of gold footballs to the
gridiron men, Footballs will also be pre-
sented to several alumni who have shown
special interest in Davidson athletics. In
acdtion to these, there will be the award
of the gymnastic trophy, individual de-
velopment ward, and possibly one or two
other cups and trophies.

A number of entries have already beén
received for the high school track meet
here March 21st, and Davidson authori-
ties are expecting one of the largest fields
that has ever turned out for this meet.
Captain Pritchett says that the whole
afternoon’s events will be run off in a
smooth and orderly fashion, and that
there will be something happening all the
time. A well-conducted meet is highly en-
tertaining and in the past these high
school affairs have produced some strong
competition. It is likely that this year will
be no exception.

A “Believe it or Not” happening which
occurred at the last year meet has re-
cently been brought to light. It seems that
the Raleigh team was late in getting here,
and as the entries for the 880 yard run
took their posts, the Raleigh boys were

The inclement wether has held back the
work of ‘the baseball team a good deal,
and so it has been hard to get any definite
line on the prospects. The general con-
census of opinion seems to be that the
team this year will be as strong or strong-
er than that of last, if the pitchers come
through. The infield should be improved
over that of last spring, the outfield
should be as good, and the pitchers are

an enigma.

The Varsity won't go into action until
Spring Holidays and the first home game
is not on the card until April 9th. De-
votees of the Nation’s pastime will have
to wait almost a month before they get a

| glimpse of the Wildcats in action.
