* Broad Jump of 20 Feet—Hender-
son Wins Both Dashes

Saturday morning the Sophomores took
first honors. Their representatives made a
total of 51 points. Second and third places
in the meet were won by the Juniors and
Freshmen with 35 and 22 points respectively.
No places were made in any event by the
Seniors,

On account of the javelin breaking, this
contest had to be cancelled. “With the ex-
ception of this and the pole vault, every
other event of a regulation track meet was
run off. C. C. McMillan, of the Junior class,
furnished the surprise of the morning when
he made a running broad jump of 20 ft . 2 in.
And this without having ever before been
out for track. In an unofficial attempt Mc-
Millan jumped 22 feet. He will train with
the Varsity squad the remainder of the sea-
son.

Tom Baker copped second place in both
the mile and two-mile races for the Sophs.
Henderson, of the Fresh class, showed him-

Wildcat Golfers Enter

Tournament at Atlanta

Earnhardt, DeArmon, Jones and
Reeves to Represent Davidson
in Southern Meet

The golf team, composed of Earnhardt,
DeArmon, Jones and Reeves, left Tuesday
for Atlanta to enter the golf tournament
staged by the Southern Intercollegiate Golf
Association. This tournament is sponsored
by Georgia Tech and is to be held at the
East Lake Country Club links, reputed as
the best in the South.

Thursday the medal play for the cup will
be held. The foursome from Davidson
should present a formidable appearance since
each man is a player of known skill. As
their opponents, they will find teams from
such colleges as Vanderbilt, Georgia Tech,
University of Alabama, University of Ten-
nessee and University of Georgia. Should
the Davidson foursome fail to win the cup,
even a creditable showing will be of great
advantage to Davidson’s athletics. On Fri-
day the individual play will begin and at least
two of the Davidson golfers should rank
around the top.

This is the second tournament of its kind
to be held, the first being held at the Uni-
versity of Tennessee last year. It will ap-
parently become an annual affair and it is
up to Davidson to put teams on the field
that will uphold Davidson’s reputation and
come away fighting if not victorious.

The-object of the tournaments is to pro-
mote interest in golfing throughout the
Southern colleges and to furnish competition
in this sport for these colleges. It has been
entered in fine spirit by most of the South-
ern colleges. This year marks Davidson's
first representation at the tournament.

Mrs. Paisley, who has been quite ill for
some time, is improving.

Mrs. J. M. McConnell, who has been visit-
ing in Charlottesville, has returned to Da-
vidson.

Lanier’s Pitching Fools Davidson
Fresh and Walks off with 8-2
Victory

The Davidson Wildkittens bowed to the
Charlotte High School aggregation in a
keenly contested game on Richardson Field
last Saturday. afternoon to the tune of 8
to 2.

The Wildkittens started off the game with
a flash that led all spectators to believe that
the Charlotte team would be swept off their
feet by a large margin, but those who had
done so were forced to change their opin-
ions in the sixth inning when the Highs piled
up four tallies to their credit, giving the
Freshies, a good scare and showing them that
the game had not yet been won.

Each team scored only five hits during
the entire nine innings. All hits were singles
except the one three-sacker that was poled
out by Schwartz in the ninth, scoring a man
who was on first.

Lanier, the winning pitcher, struck out
seven men, while Hampton, for Davidson,
struck out five. Kiser, who weft in for
Hampton in the eighth inning, blanked two
men,
