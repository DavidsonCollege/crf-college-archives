Ravenel’s Play Approved,
Restricted To Writing Class

By STEVE CROSS
Copy Editor

Despite fears of an ad-
verse reaction from the
Trustees and the Presby-
teries of the church, a con-
troversial play written by
Will Ravenel will be per-
formed in Hodson Hall for
members of Ravenel's crea-
tive writing class only.

No date has been set, but
according to Ravenel, the
actors have been ordered to

go “ahead and memorize
their lines.

The play is built on the
physchological problems a
present-day Jesus would
have adjusting to modern
life.

Ravenel added that Assist-
ant Professor of Drama
Rupert T. Barber had pre-
viously declined to let it
be staged there, although he
said he personally liked it,
because he felt that adverse
controversy would hurt the
drama department.

Reportedly, Dean of the
Faculty Frontis W. Johns-
ton made the decision to al.
low Ravenel to produce the
play. The general public
and students outside Charles
Cornwell's English 170 class
will not view the play.

At a meeting of the Union
Board ‘Monday night, the
problem of whether to open
the Morrison Room to the
use of the players was de-
bated.

Several members of the
board, led by Terry Hirst,

Cecil. Burney,’ and Rich
Cowart, expressed their de-
sire to prevent the play
from being censored.

C. Shaw Smith, director
of the college union, ex-
pressed reservations about
the play. He told the board
that he had nothing against
the play itself, but that he
feared that it might be mis-
understood.

Smith said he could not
support the'play ‘‘the way it
was presented, because it
could be misunderstood
among some _ constitutents
of the college that I feel it's
important to be considerate
of. ‘

“And if others have to
answer for us, it’s only fair
for them to be a part of
the decision.”

Board members Rich
Cowart and Terry Hirst
proposed a two-part resolu-
tion in favor of the play's
being performed in the
Union. Hirst said at the
meeting that the purpose of
the resolution was to al-
low the Union Board to
stand in favor ‘‘and let the
burden of rejection fall else-
where."'

The resolution stated that
the Morrison Room should
be available to Ravenel, and
that the Union Board would
in no way “bar or censor”
him,.but also that the Union
Board was not a sponsor of
the event, that Union per-
sonnel would not be requir-
ed to take part.

A second part—of the _re-

e

solution expressed general
support of academic freedom
at Davidson College ‘within
the classroom and in (the
college's) public lectures,
programs, and other produc-
tions.”

The board passed _ both
parts of the resolution, and
voted to send a copy of
them to the President, the
Dean of the Faculty, and
the Dean of Students.

Asked what action he
would take on the resolu-
tions passed by the board,
Smith said that he would
like to support them and
that ‘I wish we could scrap
the word veto."

After three years of pre-
paration WDAV will begin
broadcasting at 2 p. m. to-
day.

The broadcasting system
is known as a “carrier cur
rent” system, which means
that each building where the
signal is to be received
must be linked to the cen
tral transmitter by a broad
cast cable.

But the station plans to
begin immediately to work
for a license from the Fed-
eral Communications Com-
missjen to broadcast as a
regular educational #M
radio station, according to
Ed Dobbs, station manager.

“On Friday we'll only be
transmitting to
mitory,’’ Dobbs explained
“But we will have a_direct
hook-up: to the..sound system
in the College Union which
will allow anyone who
doesn't live in Belk to come

over and listen to our sta-
tion.”

He said that all _ other
dormitories on campus

would be able to receive the
broadcasts by ‘the end of
school, “hopefully before
June.””

Currently the
transmitter has 20 watts of
power, enough for all the
dormitories, and broadcasts
bn a frequency of 640 kilo-
hertz. Transmissions can be
received about 100 feet out
from each building, but can-
not be received anywhere
off campus.

Plans for the radio sta-
tion took formation in the
fall of 1967, when Dobbs was
named by the SGA to in-
vestigate the possibilities of

Station's

Senate Asks

Class Break

By GRAY WILSON

Asst. Managing Editor

The SGA has petitioned
the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee (FEC) to sispend
classes for three days next
week so that students can
express their concern over
recent developments in in
ternational, policy and do-
mestic unrest on the cam-
puses.

_ SGA President Ran Coble
met with the FEC. yester-
day to discuss three petitions

Ombudsman Panel Would

Settle Student Grievances

The student Senate is in-
vestigating the possibility of
creating an ombudsman to
facilitate the communication
of student grievances in a

more organized and effective *

manner.

“Ombudsman” is taken
from the Swedish term for
a public official who checks
government activities which
may infringe. on the rights
of the “individual, but the
broader usage on American
campuses refers to a quali-
fied student advisor on legal
and business matters.

The plan at Davidson in-
volves the appointment of
two ombudsmen by the SGA
from the student body who
would act to organize and
channel student complaints
into a common source.

Every week a panel, com-
posed of the two ombudsmen
and a representative from
the faculty and the adminis-
tration, would meet to dis-
cuss the grievances and to
make recommendations
through correct channels.

The ombudsmen would

have no policy-making pow-
ers nor would they be finan
ced by student funds. Service
would be strictly voluntary.

The ombudsmen would be-
come ex-officio members of
the Senate, but they would
exercise no voting privileges.
Their responsibility would
center chiefly around keep-
ing the SGA informed of their
activities and progress.

It has been suggested that
Davidson College has enough
options and open channels
for student gripes as it is,
and the limited size” of the
institution makes such an
office unnecessary.

Freshman Bill Alexander,
who has been working on this
project for the Senate, be-
lieves the ombudsman can
benefit students at Davidson
by sounding out the general
campus feeling on certain
questions.

Alexander sees the advan-
tage of the ombudsman in
his ability to act more quick-
ly and efficiently than other
groups, such as the ad hoc
committees which spring up
constantly.

He remarked that faculty
members may also petition

the Ombudsman Panel with
any grievances they may
have.

Alexander added that Col-
lege President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. supports the idea
all the way, and that he is

open to any recommenda-
tions.

There are ,125 colleges
across the United States

which now have an ombuds-
man, and his status jranges
from a lawyer paid, by stu-
dent funds to a professor of-
fering practical advice.

The ombudsman has been
a popular innovation, espe-
cially on large campuses,
where administrative errors
are difficult to trace. The
liberal student body presi-
dent at N. C. State University
is pushing for an ombuds-
man on that campus next
year.

Stonybrook College in New
York, with an enrollment of
8,000 students, employed an
ombudsman who discovered
so many flaws in the admin-
istration framework that
classes were suspended
three days te completely re-
structure the school.

adopted by the SGA in its
meeting Wednesday night.

The FEC: is expected to act
on: the requests today.

The first proposal, present-
ed by Bobby Allen, asks
that the faculty encourage
individual professors to work
with their classes to make
arrangements for the rest
of the year which would per
mit students to participate
in extra-campus activities
regarding the Cambodian ia
volvement and nationwide
Student protest of the war

Allen “believes this ap-
proach is advantageous be-
cause it is in accordance
with the policy of the fac-
ulty to leave most of the de
cisions concerning classes to
the-discretion of the individ-
ual professors.

The second proposal was
submitted by Cecil Burney for
Robert ‘Pyeatt, and it calls
for the moratorium on clas-
ses, May 27-29, for the same
reasons.

The last petition, proposed
jointly by Danny Clodfelter
and Cecil Burney, suggests
that the SGA be allowed to
keep the American flag on
campus lowered at _halfe
mast for the rest of the year
in recognition of the stu-
dent deaths at Kent State
and Jackson State.

The SGA has also planned
a survey of opinion in the
student body and the David-
son community.

Three statements will be
circulated: One denounces
U.S. policy over the war,
another supports passage of
the Cooper-Church Amend-
ment, now pending in the U.
S. Senate, and the last one
expresses confidence in the
actions of President Nixon.

The petitions will be col-

lected and sent to Sen.
George McGovern, where
they will be forwarded to
senators still uncommitted
on the issue.

EPC Debates How To Mix Honor
System With Self-Scheduled Exams

By RICH WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor
Can the honor system

bear the strain of self -
scheduled exams?

This will be the question
which the Educational Po-
licy Committee (EPC) will
consider next Monday. 4

According ‘to ‘Danny Clod-

felter, student representa-
tive on the EPC, the fac-
ulty HPC members feel that
the adoption of self-schedul
ed exams will increase re-
liance on the court as well
as cause administrative dif-
ficulties for it.

“The main issue which
the faculty must decide is

Wackman, Sengal Organize
ROTC Protest For Tuesday

Freshmen David Sengel
and John Wackman have
sent a letter to Colonel Vir-
gil P. Foster, professor of
military science, notifying
him of their intention to
“stage a peaceful demon-
stration near the ROTC drill
field,"’ on Tuesday.

“We are calling for a stu-
dent boycott of ROTC drill
on that’ day,’’ the letter
said. ‘‘The purpose (of this
demonstration) is to ex
press our increasing concern
over the national adminis-
tration’s policy of war."

Although the letter does
not explicitly state that they
would like to hold the de-
monstration ‘inside the gates

of the drill field, Wackman
said that was the intent.

“If they won't let us in
through the main gates,
we'll find some other way
to get in,”’ he said.

Both Sengal and Wack-
man said they have been
talking to ROTC students
asking them to consider the
boycott. They also said they
hoped some would drop out
of the ranks during the drill.

“Since federal inspection
will be held on that day, we
want to impress the high
government officials that
there are students here at
Davidson, many ROTC, who
object to *the war,” said
Wackman.

not only «the self-scheduled
exam proposal itself, but
also the condition of the
honor system as a whole,"
said Clodfelter.

Both old and new mem
bers of the’ ‘Honor ‘Court
have testified at ‘EPC meet-
ings in the past two weeks
in order to express their
feelings on how the proposal
will affect the Horior Sy-
stem.

tthe Honor Court mem-
bers said they felt - that
doubts about the proposal
could be rectified by the ac
tions of an agressive court
as well as a good selling
and education job among
the student body,"’ he said.

“The basic concern of the
faculty however is the ex-
change of information be-
tween those who take the
same exam at different
times.

“The problem seems. to
rest on whether the students
are concerned enough to
make the honor — system
work,”’ he said. ‘I hope that
at Monday's meeting we will
reach concensus on the
honor system and its rela-
tion to. the  selfscheduled
exam proposal.”

Former Honor Court
Chairman Ken Crews ex
pressed his favorable out-
look on the — self-scheduled

exam proposal. “I feel this
would be good for the honor
system,”-he said.

“It would increase the re-
sponsibility of the court as
well as that of the students.
I feel this would be a
healthy development for the
campus.

Sengel said that they sent
the letter to Foster because
they felt ‘‘that was the
courteous thing to do."

“We aren't trying to pull
a surprise attack or make
it look like we're battling
them,’ said Wackman.
“We just want to have a
silent demonstration to ex-
press our objections. All
those who want peace will
be there.”

The letter said that the
demonstration’s purpose was
not ‘“‘to interfere with the
ROTC program or infringe
upon the rights of any mem-
bers of this academic com.
munity.”

“If the honor system does
truly work, —self - sched-
uled exams shouldn't strain
it too much. And if the sy-
stem fails, then we'll have
to find something to re-
place it."

Crews saitt that he saw no
reason why the /honor  sy-
stem should not be challeng-
ed, . ,

“Although I think we need
to take the risk,’’ he said,
“in my opinion I don't think
the honor system will have
trouble surviving."

Concerning the doubts of
the faculty, Crews said that
“they were afraid of the
added burden which would
be placed on the students
given the opportunity and
the pressure.

“However, this can only be
applied to a minority of the
Student body,"’ he said.-

Students
Vote For
Early Exam

A recent questionnaire
* concerning an academic
calendar for the 1970 - 71
school year received only
a 49% response from the
freshman and sopohomore
classes.

However, the results show
a marked preference for
having the final spring term
exam fall on or before June
Ist.

Second in preference was
the desire for a long spring
break, of at least one week.

The questionnaire was di-
vided into two parts.

The first part asked for a
numerical ranking in order
of preference for six sug-

gestions — such as “‘last
exam by June Iist,"’ “long
spring break,’ and ‘avoid

split winter term.”

The second part listed six
possible. 1970 - 71 calendar
combinations, and _ again
asked for a numerical per-
ference ranking.

The most preferred
calendar combination, by
quite a margin, was the one
including the last exam on

June Ist, a long spring
break, and a_ split winter
term.

The questionnaire was

circulated in, response to a
Faculty Executive Commit-
tee request. The results will
undoubtedly be a significant
factor in its 1970-71 calen-
dar deliberations.
