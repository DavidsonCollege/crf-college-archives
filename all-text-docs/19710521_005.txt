Dornitary Suit Filed

Clifford Farrington, a sophomore at Rutgers University,
has filed a suit against the’ university over what he terms
“inadequate facilities’ in his dormitory.

Legal Services attorney Richard Fisher, who will repre-
sent Farrington, conducted a survey of the dormitory situa-
tion at the request of the student government association and
reported that grounds for a complaint do exist. °

Among Farrington’s complaints are ‘‘an. absence of ef-
fective security and possible hot water injury to students due
to inadequate shower facilities.

UNC Housing Policy Attacked

The Residence College Federation has urged the Dean
of Student Affairs of the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill to extend off campus living permission to sopho-
mores and junior transfer students for the coming academic
year.

Steve Saunders, chairman of the RCF, called for an end
to ‘forcing people to live in our residence halls, Our residence
program should attract the students.”

Saunders contended that the present policy will have ‘‘dis-

astrous results if it is applied next year.”

Students Fund MOPAC

Students at Washington University and St. Louis Univer-
sity have overwhelmingly voted to tax themselves to support
the Missouri Public Action Council (MOPAC).

Based on the model of Ralph Nader’s organization the
MOPAC will represent the public interest in such matters
as consumer protection, environmental quality, racial and
sexual discrimination,
of health care,

The two universities .will be the principal coordinators
and funders of MOPAC,

Centre Changes Board Plan

Centre College will initiate a continuous service in their
Student cafeteria without the use of meal tickets in the fall
according to the Centre Cento.

Students will not be limited to three meals a day but
they will be required to pay for each meal they take in the
cafeteria. Saga Food Service, which runs the cafeteria, will
provide unlimited access for students throughout the day.

“LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Expedient Trustee Decision

Succeeds Due To Apathy

To the Editor:

The recent Board of Trus-
tees decision concerning fra-

ternities and social life on

campus has raised the heat-
ed controversy that could be
expected from a vibrantly
active and ‘aware campus
community that we have
here.

Those who disagree with
the action (besides those
who are directly involved,
namely the fraternities)
merely wrote iit off to the
further ineptitude of an ad-
ministration that conducts
surprise registrations and ex-
tended admissions deadlines
and iassures us that we will
all have rooms next year... .
someplace.

Those who agree with the
system agreed with the ac-
tion because they had gotten
what ‘they had wanted and if
‘a few people disagree, ‘‘Well,

. that can be expected with_7

any new system.”

These attitudes again show

the apathy of this extremely
educated community to what
will effect it most. This
willingness ito contem)
what is going on around us
makes us the dupes, the suc-

~kers, and any other vernia-

cular phrase that denotes
one who is gullible, for any

College Should Consider
Students Before Efficiency

Davidson is fast becoming
a school where the student-
administration ratio is more
favorable than the student-
faculty. ratio. .

Over the past year at least
12 mew faces have enter-
ed the college administration.
Office space has grown so
much ‘that two classrooms
have been made into offices.
Exactly when this process
will stop is still unknown.

First and most obvious is
the 10 per cent rise in tui-
tion. This will hurt many of
us and may cut down on any
thing extra someone might
want to do. This is accom-
panied by the fact that
scholarships will no longer
meet all financial need. The
have-nots now are being hit
on both sides.

A second consequence is a
10 per cent cut in the athletic
budget. Major sports such as
football, basketball, or ten-
nis will not suffer and right-
ly so. :

The ones who will suffer
will be the student-run acti-
vities such as sailing, rugby,
or. the club sports, In addition
any new sport which wanted
to come on campus will have
to wait or be funded out of
students ‘pockets. These in-
clude a crew or club foot-
ball. This type of activity is

often wheré the average stu- .

dent can) get thé fullest en-

joyment from. athletics.

A third major area to be
affected will be the already
overworked faculty. Depart-
mental sercretaries to help
professors who could be
spending more time with stu-
dents or in the community
will not be forthcoming.

No new members outside
of replacements will go in-
to departments such as poli-
tical science, biology, or psy-
chology. Raises for many
faculty members will be de-
layed or cut out altogether.
In this area both students
and faculty will suffer.

It seems that right now
ideas of efficiency and a
strong administration have
come out ahead of concern
for the student and provid-
ing a good college life.

Next year’s freshmen will
spend at least three year’s
without a Union. They will
be counseled by a_ faculty
member who has a double
obligation to both students
and faculty.

Tuition raises show no signs
of slacking off despite the
new fund raising team which
will enter the field. All in all
a pretty. bleak picture.

Davidson still will have
many advantages, but the
catalogue and public rela-
tions department can de-
scribe them more skillfully
than this writer. It seems

as though the college has
gone too far and too fast in
its changes.

Perhaps the administration
should pause and look at
what it has done.’ Maybe it
should listen to the grumb-
ling of those outside of the
Senate and other similar
bodies.

The question of whether the
student or efficiency is more
important will have to be
solved, The student had bet-
ter win if Davidson is to

survive.

blunder that distinguished
administration may make.

Let us review what we had
before and compare it to
what we have now. Before
we had a college sanctioned

and for all practical purpos--

es college enforced social
system of fraternities. This
always excluded 5- 15 per
cent of our student body
from the only type of social
life that was offered. This
was wrong and unfair, that
point is not being disputed.

Now we have a_ college
sanctioned and enforced so-
cial system: This is an ex-
periment in ‘social systems
that is designed to pioneer
the field and make a lasting
contribution to society.

In this experiment there
are approximately 200 un-
willing participants. This 20
per cent has been offered .no
choice in the matter. Sound

familiar? How can any new
system succeed when 1/5 of
its panticipants are forced
to take part? Have not the
fraternities the same rights
as anyone else?

Yes, this is a question of
rights. We needed a new sy-
stem that would give every-
one the opportunity to parti-
cipaite. Presently individuals
have the right to go else-
where, but any group does .
not.

What will be done next in
the name of expediency I
iam afraid to speculate on,
but I am sure of one thing,
that this smacks of utter and
complete administration con-
trol over everything that can

_effect this student body.

\\ This is not power with con-

sent but, power for them to

do what they feel is right.

Galbraith Wrote Speech
Specially For Davidson?

To the Editor:

Bill Mayfield is to be com-
mended for the discovery
that Professor Gailbraith's
Visit to the Davidson campus
occasioned.

This discovery, set forth in
Mr. Mayfield’s letter in
THE DAVIDSONIAN, May
14, is the commonplace ob-

. servation that some of us are

greater frauds than others,
r more accurately, some of
us sare so foolish as to ex-
pose our fraud to the public.

Profé$sor Galbraith accept-
ed the invitation to give a
Reynolds Lecture at Davidson
in May, 1971 in January, 1970.

It is possible, though not
very probable, that he wrote
“Foreign Policy: The Next
Reform’’ for ‘this purpose.
It is not uncommon for col-
lege professors, as with a
few other groups, to get as
much intellectual mileage
out of their efforts a possible.
Therefore, when two of Gal-
braith’s friends started a new
publication,

y,’’ and invited him to write

Well, we waited for the room drawing.

“Foreign Poli-

the first “‘guest editorial,’
it is conceivable that he
merely used the speech he
had prepared especially for
Davidson College.

It is, of course, much more
likely that the order of events
was reversed.

A bit more research by Mr.
Mayfield would have uncov-
ered the fact that the same
speech-article is reprinted in
Galbraith’s latest book,
Economics, Peace and Lau-
ghter,, and a modicum of
knowledge about these mat-
ters would enable one to
predict, with little fear of
being wrong, that when an
aspiring young professor of
Potitical science ‘‘writes’’ his
“Readings in Foreign Pol-
icy,’’ the speech-article, or
article-speech, will be re-
printed again.

Getting excited about the
latter issue has the advant-
age of leaving the throwing
of .stones to people who do
not live in glass houses.
