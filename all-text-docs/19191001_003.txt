MINISTERIAL BAND HEARS
TALKS BY SULLIVAN
AND HUNTER.

At 6:10 o'clock on last Sunday even-
ing the Ministerial Band held a very in-
teresting meeting. The attendance was
good.

Sullivan and Hunter made the two
talks of the evening on subjects which
were of interest to all present, “The
Need of Ministers” and “The Supply
and Demand of Ministers.”

| In treating the first of these subjects,
Sullivan pointed out first, the need of

‘ministers to save lost souls, and second,

ithe need of the minister's uplifting in-
, fluence upon human society. He showed
‘that every good work in either home.
community or state life could be traced
hack to the. minister. On these two
needs he based a call to the ministry.
“The harvest truly is plenteous, but the
laborers are few.”

Hunter spoke on the “Supply and
Demand of Ministers.” He showed
that in this age there was a greater need
of ministers than ever before. Since the
war all other religions are making in-
i creased effort to win followers, and
Christianity must in this critical time
make a renewed effort. He pointed out
the fact that now there are two hun-
dred and fifty-four pulpits vacant, be-
cause no one can be found to fill them.
that over one thousand missionaries are
needed on the foreign field, four hun-
dred of these, men, and that in the home
field one hundred men are needed to

supply new churches, which are being
founded. He also said that this short-
age in the ministry was causing an over
-burdening of the pastors, an unfed
jchurch and a lagging in the Kingdom
of God. As a concrete instance he told
of a Davidson alumnus who is preaching
four times every Sunday and is covering

a pastorate of nine hundred square miles.
He closed with an urgent appeal that,
in view of these facts, more of the’
Christian students at Davidson should.
enter the work of the ministry. |

GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT |
FELT OVER INABILITY OF
BOB JONES TO VISIT
DAVIDSON.

Bob Jones, the famous eyangelist, was
expected to make an address to the stu-
dent body Monday morning at chapel.
the regular Sunday evening service hav-
ing been postponed by the unanimous
consent of the students. It was Avith
real regret, therefore, that it was learn-
ed that he could not come to Davidson
Monday. !

Mr. Miles hopes to get the evange-
list later on in the week, if possible.
Bob Jones has made a great impression

We announce him as the youngest mem-

We wish to call attention to the

printer’s error made in last week's issue. |
The smaller heading of the article on;
Dr. Harding should have read “Has:

Rendered Longer Service Than Any
Other Member of Faculty" instead of
“Larger Service.”

In the same article it should be “thir-
ticth consecutive year” instead of “thir-
teenth.”

When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and Trust
Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to
“go to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then
a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in
touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen
his strong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good.
Drop us a line and ask us to give you full particulars.
