ended a ten-year championship

drought by capturing the South-

OUR FRIENDS, THE S. CONFERENCE

Last Friday in Natural Bridge, Virginia, the
Southern Conference held its annual meeting.

Two proposals of some importance were voted
on, and the results of these are about what you’d
expect from one of the two conferences in the na-
tion that still insists on determining their season
basketball champion in three days.

Three years ago the Southern Conference, in a
rare state of mind decided to initiate a small reform.
To prevent schools from holding some athletes out
of competition in a year when talent is abundant,
and bringing these holdouts back to play in lean
years, the Conference passed an “anti-redshirting”’
rule on December 14, 1962.

In essence this rule said that an athlete had four
years of eligibility, expiring four years from the date
of his matriculation. This rule was to go into effect
with the Class of 1967. :

Last Friday at the meeting, Richmond offered
a proposal to repeal the anti-redshirt rule, which had
not yet been enforced (since the Class of 1967 hadn’t
been playing varsity ball long enough to be held out
any).
Instead of repeal, however, Richmond got some-
thing just about as good. With only West Virginia
and Davidson voting no, the Southern Conference
decided to delay the redshirt rule until the Class of
1968 would be affected.

The problem was referred to a committee to be
investigated. In the meantime a small, but sound re-
form that was drawn up and passed in 1962, still
has not been put into effect in 1965, and at best
won’t be used until the fall of 1966 — although pro-
bably it will be delayed again.

The second stroke of genius the Conference
came up with typifies even more their “mental
maturity.”

Last fall the football coaches voted to recom-
mend to this conference meeting the setting up of
a minimum college board score for all athletes re-
ceiving a grant-in-aid.

The ACC has a rule putting a floor of 750 on
the college boards in order for any athlete to receive
money.

Well, last Friday the Southern Conference vot-
ed on the same sort of thing, the football coaches’
proposal which put an 800 minimum on college
boards for those receiving grants-in-aid.

But this vote was defeated too. The conference’s
committee on academics (the Schools and Colleges
Committee) felt many deserving boys (deserving,
but dumb) would be prevented from receiving
scholarships.

Again this logic leaves me cold. If defeated for
anything the 800 point floor should have been vot-
ed down because it was too low. :

Davidson's representative Dr. Paul Marrotte vot-
ed to establish minimum, but like his other
vote on redshirting, for no avail.

1 guess what really takes the cake is that these
same Conference bubble brains, so intent on block-
ing any new, acess J adventurous reforms, re-
fused to mention a word about possible reform in the
anachronistic basketball tournament set up.

The only mention of this annual farce was a line
in the budget:

SMITH

And Johnny Giles Bites The Dust

By TOMMY COX
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Last Saturday in the annual spring
football scrimmage, before an unheard
of pre-season Davidson crowd of 1500
spectators, the first string offensive
and defensive team, the Reds, sound-
ly trounced their understudies, the
Whites, 40-0.

If the measure of a football team
were its spirit, Davidson’s “new” team
under Homer Smith would probably
realize a hidden dream of the David-
son community — a national football
contender.

Although they lacked some of the
savvy, the click, and surge of _——

we're right on schedule. The boys re-
ligiously did everything they were
told. The main thing was the way they
held on in that heat.”

The Red team dominated all as-
pects of play, rolling up 375 total yards
to the White’s 72.

Jake Jacobsen, a “pleasant sur-
prise’ to Smith, his staff, and the stad-
ium crowd, accounted for 215 of these
yards with pin-point passing. He com-
pleted 14 of 23 attempts, itself a sur-
prising air attack for Davidson teams.

Jacobsen’s favorite receiver was

Lefty Driesell Inks
Two Roundballers
For Next Season —

Head Basketball Coach Lefty
Driesell has announced the sign
ing of two highly-regarded prep
stars for next year’s freshman
team. They are Mike O'Neill of
Valparaiso, Ind., and Wayne
Huckel of Cranford, N. J.

O'Neill. is the first of this
year's recruits to sign. The 6-5

| senior has been named to Coach
‘and Athlete

Magazine’s All-
America team and has been
courted by some 70 institutions.

O'Neill is described by Drie-
sell as a “real good outside
shooter."

Coach Terry Holland, who
saw him play, noted, ‘‘He should
fit into our system perfectly,
as he played the same position
in high school, the wing, that
he'll probably play for us."’ Hol-
land added that O'Neill is
“strong and a good jumper.”

Such impressive attributes
helped the Hoosier to an out-
standing senior year as he fired
in 18.4 points per game and
grabbed a total of 343 rebounds.
In addition, he shot at a near-50
per cent level of accuracy and
demonstrated his team play
with 127 assists.

O'Neill ranked in the top five
per cent of his class. He plans
a career in medicine.

The latest acquisition is
Huckel. He was named to the
first unit of New Jersey's All-
State team and, like O'Neill,
was sought by a multitude of
colleges. He narrowed his
choices to Dartmouth and David-
son before choosing to come
here.

Huckel, who stands 6-1% and
weighs 183 pounds, was signed
by Coach Warren Mitchell. He
scored a career total of 892
points, finishing up with 483
tallies for a 19.2 average his
senior year.

He also led his team with 196
rebounds and connected on more
than 40 per cent of his shots
from the field. ‘

“Wayne is a good defensive
ball player,"”’ said Driesell. He
also characterized his latest
prize as “real aggressive and
strong. ‘‘He is also an outstand-
ing student and is interested
in a liberal arts education," the
coach noted.
