sororities pending
Faculty, students apprehensive

President Bobby Vagt has yet to
announce whether or not sororities
will be invited to Davidson College.

He is projected, at the earliest, to
make his decision public Dec. 15 at
this semester’s final faculty meeting.

Prior to that meeting, staff will
hold two faculty forums to debate the
issue.. Students have noticed sorority
advertisements on their halls recently,
however.

A leaflet with “Check out these
sorority programs!” handwritten
across the top has shown up in several
dormitories over the past few-weeks.

The programs, specifically, are
substance awareness and education,
eating disorder, and rape prevention
programs from Chi Omega and Kappa
Kappa Gamma sororities.

The focus on these organizations

indicates that Chi Omega and Kappa
Kappa Will be the actual sororities
invited should President Vagt allow
them.

Vagt, busy on trips to Russia,
Atlanta, and.New York City this past
week could not be reached for specific
comment on the issue.

History professor Jonathan
Berkey expects the faculty to be able
to voice its opinion to Vagt at that
meeting. ;

Berkey, aCampus Committee for
Religious Life member, who voted
against sororities expects a sincere and
throrough debate.

“There should be alot of opposi-
tion and certainly that opposition
should be expressed quite vocally.” he
said.

The faculty can pass motions or
resolutions about the issue, but Vagt’s
decision will ultimately be the only
one that will allow sororities on cam-
pus or keep them off. |

Pipe problem causes
late-night excitement

By Jessica GOODSON
News Editor

On Nov. 22, at 1:00 a.m., Duke
residents woke abruptly to the inces-
sant pound of a manhole cover, buf-
feted by a geyser of steam. Students
poured onto the lawn behind Duke to
behold the gusher.

“The toilets wouldn’t flush and
the sinks ran dry,” senior Tim Saintsing
said. “I thought Duke was going to
blow.”

According to Mechanical Shop
supervisor Jerry Archer, water had
leaked from a valve nipple into the
tunnel that carries steam into Duke,
flashing to steam itself as it hit the
scalding pipes.

The force of the steam escaping
repeatedly blew the manhole cover
off its shaft. Maintenance mechanic

Joe Crisp responded to the call, cutting
off the steam and patching leaks
promptly, as a throng of curious stu-
dents looked on.

The water pipe is equipped with
a strainer on entrance to the building,
and the valve nipple which periodi-
cally cleans the strainer rusted through,
causing the leak. The nipple was re-
placed, and Archer said—notto worry
— most of Davidson’ s water pipes are
copper, which do not rust so easily.

Some students — although ini-
tially captivated by the confusion —
tired and left the scene.

“I was amazed that people were
standing with their mouths open watch-
ing a manhole cover thump and hot
water vapor rise,” junior Kurt
Fesenmyer said.

“Tt was an entertaining evening,”
said Saintsing.

Patterson endowment
established for Econ

College Relations

Friends, colleagues, and former stu-
dents have established the Patterson En-
dowment in Economics in memory of
Professor Ernest Finney Patterson, pro-
fessor of economics at Davidson for
more than two decades and an active
fighter for the welfare for. those less
economically fortunate.

Timed for the 40th Anniversary of
“Pat” Patterson’s arrival at Davidson in
1957, the Endowment will commemo-
rate his career as a teacher and social
activist by providing funds for projects
consistent with his personal ideals.

The endowment will subsidize stu-
dents engaged in research projects in
economics and support an annual de-
partmental award to a junior or senior
student who has demonstrated accom-
plishment in economics.

In honor of the establishment of
this endowment, Professor of English
Tony Abbott has edited a collection of
_ Professor Patterson’s poems. Called

Poems for the People because of their
subject matter and their direct and im-
mediate emotional appeal to the reader,
this collection of 30 poems includes a
Foreword by Professor Charles Ratliff
‘47, longtime professor of economics
and close friend of Dr. Patterson, and a
handsome cover drawing of Ernie
Patterson by Tom clark ‘49.

“These poems crafted for the
people, “ Ratliff said, “are by one who
crafted his life for the people.”

Many of them are set on the farm in
Rising Star, Texas, where Patterson grew
up during the 1920s and the early years
of the Great Depression. :

A copy of Poems for the People
will be given to donors who contribute at
least $100 to the Endowment.

Contributions earmarked for the
Patterson Endowment should be mailed
to Professor Clark Ross, Chair, Depart-
ment of Economics, P.O. Box 1719,
Davidson, N.C., 28036.

Checks should be made payable to
Dayidson College.

Town celebrates Christmas

9th Annual Christmas in Davidson
brings Village charm — and Santa

By Mary LEE
Staff Writer

“Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer,
had a very shiny nose...”

Village charm could be felt late
last week during Davidson’s 9th An-
nual Christmas in Davidson celebra-
tion.

Three evenings of festivities, mu-
sic, storytelling, carolling, entertaining,
and Christmas spirit began Wednesday
at an Opening Ceremony on the Village
Green. A special guest — Santa Claus
— arrived by fire truck.

Every year since 1989, the town of
Davidson celebrates three nights of
merrymaking during the week after
Thanksgiving.

Theevent has grown so much since
its beginning that the number of car-
riage and hay rides have been increased
to accommodate the larger crowds.

“The event promotes a feeling of
community and Christmas spirit,” said

Irene Blackwell, who is a member of
the Downtown Davidson Organization
(DDO), which is presenting the event
along withthe Davidson Parks and Rec-
reation Department.

“It has evoked enthusiasm from
the very beginning and is community-
wide. The College, industries, churches
and merchants all participate.”

More than 35 merchants and non-
profit groups.participated at Christmas
in Davidson 1997.

Shop owners opened their doors
every evening from 6:30 p.m. to 9:00
p.m. to provide free refreshments,
planned entertainment, and night shop-
ping.

Along with Santa’s appearance on
the fire truck, the Doggie Holiday Fash-
ion Show on the Village Green Thurs-
day was also a favorite. Town and area
residents entered their pooches in a dog
show, only with a twist — the pets were
decked out and-judged in holiday cos-
tumes.

“One dog was dressed in a butter-
fly costume,” Rebecca Clark of DDO

* said.

“He jumped up and down and
looked just like a butterfly.”

Many corporations contributed to
the event’s success, including BB&T,
Davidson College, Duke Power, First
Union National Bank, Ingersoll-Rand,
Jaspers Restaurant, Kennerly Develop-
ment, Metrolina Warehouse, Revell
Manufacturing and The Village Store.

“We are also especially apprecia-
tive of town employees,” Clark added,
“for stringing up the lights and banners
throughout town.”

If students would like to partici-
pate next year as entertainers or per-
formers, they should contact the David-
son Parks and Recreation Department.

“Most of the entertainers get paid,”
Clark said, “so:if you have juggling or
musical talents, you could make some
money for the holidays and experience
some of Davidson’s Christmas spirit.”
