THE DAVIDSONIAN

Wildcats’ season of heartbreak

By Micuaet J. Kruse

Say this for coach Tim Landis and
his Wildcat gridders; One thing they
don’t lack is consistency:

When they win, they win big —
41-25 over Maryville, 42-14 over
Sewanee, and 43-0 over Hampden-
Sydney — but when they lose, they do
so in ex-
cruciating
fashion
and they
do it in the
fourth
quarter — or, as it turned out this week,
overtime.

The football team lost its seventh
game Saturday at Richardson Field,
posting a 10-0 lead in the first quarter
and then stumbling the rest of the way
en route to a disheartening 13-10 OT
defeat at the hands-of-an- upstart
Bridgewater squad.

“We didn’t execute,” Landis said
inasomber press box. “And we weren't
doing a whole lot on offense.”

At least not after the first 15 min-
utes. The Wildcats got on the board
with 6:46 left in the opening quarter, as

Brian Langley booted a career-best 38-
yard field goal to give Davidson an
early 3-0 lead.

And with 1:43 left in the period,
the Wildcats upped their advantage to
10-0 ona 30-yard touchdown pass from
Tommy .Dugan to fullback Eric
Ferguson.

It was Dugan’s eighth scoring toss
of the fall, as the Wildcat signal-caller
hit Ferguson in stride on a beautifully
thrown ball. ;

After that, though, it was all Eagles,
as the Wildcats blundered their way to
an anemic 24 yards and four first downs
in the second half. :

Bridgewater (2-8) finally broke its

scoreless drought with 10:17 to go in,

the game when Michael Padgett split
the uprights with an ugly but effective
20-yard field goal.

Padgett’s three-pointer was set up
four plays earlier on a 52-yard bomb
from_Bridgewater quarterback. Brith
Osinkosky to wide receiver Robert
Ziegenfuss.

On the ensuing Davidson drive,
Shaun Tyrance — who replaced starter
Tommy Dugan at quarterback midway
through the third period in an effort by
Landis to jumpstart the stagnant of-

Bridgewater’ s offense took advan-
tage of the turnover, putting together a
five-play, 13-yard touchdown drive.

‘Marcus Webb took it in from two
yards out and Padgett’s extra point knot-
ted the game with 6:48 remaining.

In overtime, the Eagles struck first
on a booming 37-yard Padgett field
goal.

Davidson’s possession, an inef-
fective three-and-out, resulted in a
missed 43-yard attempt by Langley —
and the Wildcats’-seventh loss in 10
tries this fall. .

“It’s difficult because I felt like we
had control of this game,” Landis said.

“T thoughtwe could keep plugging
away and geta score in the third quarter.
We really needed to come out of there
with 17 or 20 points. We just didn’t get

it done.”

“For our kids to do this on the road
like that, I’m just so grateful,”
Bridgewater coach Michael Clark said.
“T challenged them (at halftime).

“T’m just grateful they responded.
“For a lot of reasons and for a lot of
people, this was a great game.”

But not for anyone on the David-
son side of the field, as the Wildcats’
season of heartbreak continued.

S. Fla. an unprecedented challenge

Now is no time to pout for the
tough-luck football team.

Division I-AA non-scholarship
South Floridalooms. The Wildcats will
face the Bulls — looking to conclude
their inaugural season on the gridiron
with a win — in Saturday’s season
finale at 7:00 p.m. in Tampa’s
Houlihan’s Stadium.

Football
Notebook

South Florida’s 87-player roster
includes ‘54 freshmen, 15 sophomores,
15 juniors, and three seniors. Seven-
teen of those first-year collegiates turned
down at least one Division I-A scholar-
ship offer. Among the veterans, there
are 10 transfers from Division I-A pro-
grams.

Brett Avery came to USF from
Rutgers, Chad Barnhardt from South
Carolina, Kevin Bouis and Trevor
Hypolite from Kentucky, Glenn Davis
from Purdue, Keith Williams from
Memphis, Brian McNulty from Michi-
gan St., and Clif Dell and Brian Erb
from Florida St. .

“They’re good, real good,” Wild-
cat coach Tim Landis said after
Saturday’s loss.

“They’re the best team we play
this season by far.”

While Davidson’ s chances of clos-
ing the. season with a win are slim to
none — and probably closer to none
than slim — the game will still repre-
sent an opportunity for the Wildcats to
create a sort of bowl-game-like atmo-
sphere on a fun-in-the-sun trip.

Also, the crowd will certainly be
the largest for a Davidson football game
this season — and probably in decades.

South Florida sold 17,000 season
tickets before its 1997 campaign ever
began. Houlihan’s Stadium, which seats
up to 74,000 for the NFL Tampa Bay
Bucs’ games, has a capacity of 46,500
for USF contests.

“We'll go down there and play our
hearts out,” Landis said.

Sapp stars in home finale

Senior wide receiver Eric Sapp
finished his home career with a stellar
effort, pacing the Wildcats’ receiving
corps with three catches for 44 yards.
“He’s had a great year,” Landis said.
“It’s been tremendous for him because
he played very little his first three years.
He’s not the fastest guy out there, not
the strongest guy out there, but he’s got
abig heart.” ... Saturday's game marked
the final home game for Davidson’s 12
seniors. Middle linebacker Shreve
Ariail, fullback Ellis Boyle, defensive
tackle Brian Brown, offensive line-
man Brian Cowan, offensive lineman
Mike Cowles, defensive tackle Ryan
Gist, linebacker Chris Hess, offensive
lineman Joe Mahoney, cornerback
Sandy Neblett, Sapp, center Chip
Stewart, and defensive lineman
Marcus Williams were all honored in
a pregame ceremony ... Wildcat punter
Jeremiah Parvin, who has averaged
38.5 yards a kick in this, his rookie
season, unleashed ‘a career-best 59-
yarder with approximately 13 minutes
left in the second quarter that literally
died on the Bridgewater one-inch line
... Saturday’s. leading tacklers for the
Wildcats: Ariail with a dozen, safety
Chad Wright and Hess each with 10,
androokie standout Bo Henderson with
9. Wright had Davidson’s only inter-
ception.

Oh so close

The Wildcats’ seven losses have
been by 14, three, 10, three, seven, five,
and three points. That’s an average
margin of defeat of 6.4 points. Four of
those losses, not including the OT loss
to the Eagles; have come in the final
1:26 ... Saturday’s 13-10 loss to
Bridgewater represented the first over-
time affair in the 100-year history of
Davidson football. The NCAA institited
the no-tie rule two years ago ... Going
into Saturday’s contest, junior tailback
Lorenzo Moll stood seventh on
Davidson’s all-time rushing chart with
1,420 yards on 341 attempts. Moll
gained only five yards on six rushes
versus the Eagles ... Fullback Eric
Ferguson, with 23 yards on seven car-
ries Saturday, moved into 10th place in
the Wildcat rushing annals. The star
sophomore from Maggie Valley, N.C.,
dubbed early in his career as the “Maggie
Valley Monster” by Davidson Radio
Network play-by-play man Frank
Santore, now has 1,146 yards on 239
rushes ... Quarterback Tommy Dugan
is fourth on the passing list. The redshirt
junior entered Saturday with 3,584 aerial
yards, having completed 275 of 557
passes in his Davidson career ... Quote
of the week: Landis as he left the press
box Saturday afternoon: “OK, I’m go-
ing to go hit my head against a wall for
a little bit.”

Florida’s best athletes. Linebacker Demetrius Woods,

There was nothing snake-bit-
ten about this loss.

It was a game the Wildcats
clearly should have won, but lost
because of their own inadequa-
cies, not some football god who
has a personal vendetta against
them.

After utterly dominating the first
quarter, the Wildcats went into a
debilitating funk from there on out,
gaining an embarrassing 24 yards
in the second half while watching
Bridgewater inexplicably tie the
game at 10 in the fourth quarter
and then use overtime to earn only
its second victory of the season.

Quarterback Tommy Dugan,
who generally made good deci-
sions in the passing game Satur-
day, released a handful of ill-ad-
vised pitches running the option.
Overall, Davidson fumbled the ball
seventimes, losing just two of them
due to several fortunate bounces.

“We've been running the op-

No snake bite in this one —
Wildcats just made mistakes

tion for four years,” Landis said,
“and | don’t remember ever having
five or six balls on the ground like
that.”

The Wildcats also committed
a dozen penalties that cost them
94 yards. Aholding infraction killed
Davidson's last drive in regulation
and a false start penalty in over-
time extended Brian Langley’s
game-tying field goal try from 37
yards to 42 yards — an important
five yards considering Langley’s
38-yarder in the first quarter barely
made it over the crossbar.

“If we don’t have that five-yard
penalty, the ball probably goes
through,” Landis admitted. “We’re
not good enough to come out and
make those kinds of mistakes.”

The type of which there were
many Saturday. ,

“We just let one slip away,”
Landis said.
