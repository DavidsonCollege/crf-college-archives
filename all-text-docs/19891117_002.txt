one, the ability to expand and improve
our physical education and intramural
programs, as well asour commitment to
Title IX and the women’s programs.

And, beyond that think obviously all
the sports need expanded facilities and
better facilities, with the exception of
ones that are going to be able to use this
particular facility.

But the Baker Sports Complex only
points out how some of the other sports
do need facilities and right away.
Obviously they are not going to be done
immediately.

The Davidsonian: Would you like to
elaborate upon any other long-term
goals?

Holland: I think that in the long term
the main thing we will have to be con-
cerned about is that Davidson finds its
niche in the athletic world. Certainly
there are a lot of pitfalls in competing in
intercollegiate athletics, particularly in
the Division I level, and we like to think
that we can bea leader in that regard, as
opposed toa follower.

The Davidsonian: Will football con-
tinue at Davidson?

Holland: Well, we are certainly expect-
ing it to. I think Division II is the proper
level for our football program at the
present time. And it’s going to takea lot
of hard work. I don’t think there is any
question about that.

I think what this year’s team and the
coaching staff did is phenomenal under

and certainly the number of players
who left the program last year and the
small numberof players whocame back
this year.

But the student body response,
people coming out for the team, as well
as the students’ cheering them, cer-
tainly made a difference this year.

The Davidsonian: Can we compete in
Division III in football and compete at
other levels in other sports?

Holland: Yes. You are allowed to‘com-
pete in Division III. And, I think again
that is where Davidson should be, at
this particular time in its history. We
can compete in the Division I level in
other sports. We are going to have to
continue to improve, again, all our fa-
cilities and everything else to maintain
that stance.

The Davidsonian: Now that we have
the natatorium, will: we’ soon have a
swim team?

Holland: We do have the natatorium
and it.is certainly a first-class facility
that was built mainly because we would
like to havea swimming program here
for both men and women. 23

The Davidsonian: How do you feel
about the Complex? Do you think it will
increase enthusiasm among students
and alumni?

Holland: I think it has to make every-
one feel good about what Davidson is
doing. And again, the key to itis that we
continue to doit in the right way; in the

efforts to make sure that everybody has
a chance to use this facility.

The Davidsonian: What do you think
about the ticket policy?

Holland: Well, you know the ticket
policy right now is a tough one because
we’re starting from scratch, trying to
come up witha ticket policy. All we can
do is look at other schools and try to de-
termine what's been done at other
places and what we think will work
here.

And I think Sterling (Sterling Martin,
Interim Athletic Director) and the
people in the athletic administration, as
well as the college administration, have
donea good job of listening toall parties
and have tried to formulate a policy that
is best for Davidson. But nobody’s
going to know until we’ve had a chance
to live with it for a few years.

The Davidsonian: Will you share:
thoughts and feelings about retiring
to Davidson?

Holland: Well, you know, people ask
me that quite often. But with a whole
year of Virginia basketball ahead of me
it’s hard to think much aboutit. I’ve got
to focus on the task at hand there. Cer-
tainly, my feelings last summer when I
took the job have not changed.

We are looking forward to returning
to Davidson and the people that we
knew, as well as the college that we
respect and love. So, I’d have to say we
will be looking forward to it in the
spring. Right now my main job is to
coach the basketball team at Virginia.
