A large percentage of such
classes are lecture courses in
which there is little or no ac-
tive student participation. But
there are also a good many that
do not fall in this category.

Of the 210 classes this year,
5% of them have an enroll-
ment of forty or more, with one
of these in excess of ninety stu-
dents. Eighty-nine percent have
an enrollment of thirty or less;
58% are under twenty; and
26°¢ of them are under ten. In
this type of break-down, last
year’s classes are almost identi-
cal with the present situation.
The difference lies in the fact
that many of the 1958-'59 class-
es have a few more students per
individual class.

Another difference is that
this year, four classes have an

"Man Must Have A
Purpose” -Graham

Man must have a purpose in
life. one to which he is dedi-
cated completely. Otherwise his
life will never find meaning
or fullfillment. “Why not let
that purpose be Jesus Christ?”
In Chapel. Wednesday morning
Dr. Billy Graham put this ques-
tion to the Davidson’ student
body.

Dr. Graham told. the student
body that by conversion he
means a spiritual and moral
change attending .a change of
belief with conviction. He
warned the students that Rus-
sian youth are passing through
a conversion. which is bringing
about a dedication among them,
a. dedication to the purpose of
establishing a new world with-
out the Kingdom of God as its
foundation. He asked the Stu-
dent Body how it thought

America could-hope to compete} that

‘however: the number and scope
of the outer state visits. have
been greatly increased. Outer

will include: A three day trip

City area: a five day tour

and_a recruiting trip of a week

jin Plorida. -

In addition, Dean White hopes
that it will be possible to ‘de-
velop a tour from Birmingham
to New Orleans, and also a tour
of the _ Cincinnati-Louisville
area. A trip to the Virginia
schools in the Norfolk-Rich-
mond area has been discon-
tinued because of the closing of
the schools .in that area.

In the. local areas, the trips
include visits to the schools,
visitation with the individual
students who are interested in
Pavidson and visits. in particu-
Jar. with the Guidance Counsel-
lors of the various high schools.

The purpose of these trips is
to acquaint the public as a
whole with Davidson College
and to meet with high school
students who are interested in
attending Davidson. The fact

their national system of demo-| least in part, of this program. It
is, however, difficult. to evalu-|

cracy much less to the Christian
religion upon which America is
established. He gave the answer:
“You must be converted!”

“To stand up to the threat
against our nation we must
reach this state of dedication
without knowing how to reach
it. The way is through a su-
pernatural power given to us
by God. I don’t know much
about God but what I do know
has changed my life. I cannot
prove that the Bible is com-
pletely true — no man can do
that because there are things
in it which only God's infinite
power can understand and ex-
plain. You must have faith to
accept it. And I promise that
if you accept it you will find
a fulfillment and a purpose in
life that you have never known
before.”

He closed by telling the stu-
dents that in order to be con-
verted they must come before
God “as a little child” —
humbled by the realization that
they have been wrong and de-
sirous of a chance to worship

God with new faith and dedi-

cation.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

New Dean Discusses
Overcrowded Situation

Dr. Frontis Johnston, newly appointed dean of the
faculty, stated last Tuesday that some of Davidson’s 1958-
‘59 classes were definitely overcrowded, but went on to
bring out that such crowded conditions were about the
same last year. He also stressed that although many of
the present classes were not of ideal size, they could
not rightly be considered to be overcrowded.

one hundred. None were in this
division last year.

There are two predominant
reasons for this slight but ap-
parent increase: the increased
enroliment, and the unexpected
loss of a few faculty members.
These include Dr. Johnston
from freshman history and Mrs.
Caroline McBrayer of the psy-
chology department.

When asked what will be
done in the future concerning
this situation, particularly with
the anticipated student body of
a thousand, Dr. Johnston replied
that it was certainly his hope
and expectation that the faculty
will be increased in number in
the future. He also ‘stated that
the chemistry and possibly the
psychology departments will be
strengthened next semester.
