Theatre, Music collaborate in ‘Company’

ELiZABETH HyLAND
Staff Writer

This spring, the Davidson The-
atre and. Music Departments jointly
present Davidson’s biennial musi-
cal, “Company.” “Company” is a
Tony Award-winning play, written
by Steven Sondheim. Directed by
Ann Marie Costa, this production
features a full orchestra of student
musicians conducted by Dr. Bill
Lawing. Jaquelyn Culpepper leads
the musical direction.

“Company” is a grand-scale
collaboration between departments,
the first in 20 years, and is also the
first to take place in the Duke Fam-
ily Performance Hall. A full or-
chestra provides a rich, lush sound,
allowing for the singers to show the
nuances in Sondheim’s work.

Set in modern New York City,
“Company” follows the love life
of the main character, Bobby, and
his interactions with his friends and

lovers. It is set in modern New York
City. Costa feels that “Company” is
“well suited to both Davidson stu-
dents and community members due
to its exploration of relationships,
family and marriage.”

“Every student shall be honor
bound to refrain from stealing.”
Though most Davidson students re-
member reading these words at the
start of freshman year, some stu-
dents may be wondering how many
people really abide by Davidson’s
esteemed Honor Code.

About two weeks ago, Chris--

tina Brown *11 reported her car

ued by saying that they had initially
looked at over fifty shows before
deciding upon “Company.”

The play appealed to them for a
multitude of reasons including the
fact that it would be the first Sond-
heim production performed at Da-

‘vidson. Costa explained that with

this play, “Sondheim gives you an
acting piece; we had in mind that
we’d like to do something that
showcased the talent of the cast.”
The strength of the cast’s acting
and singing prowess is further

ing company and finding out that
my car hadn’t been towed, I called
the cops to report my stolen car,”
Brown stated. “I don’t lend my car
to anyone, and I had my keys on
my person all week. What makes
things worse is that I have no way
to tell when it was stolen so it could
have already been sold for parts by
the time I found it was gone.”

The Davidson campus has seen
several other cases of theft in the
past few weeks, though many stu-
dents have expressed disbelief that

14 actors.

In “Company,” unlike larger
productions with ensembles of
dancers and choruses, “all 14 peo-
ple have really strong solo roles,
and it’s a lot more demanding be-
cause they have to sing, dance and
act,” Costa said.

The play does not only demand
a lot of work from the actors but
also from the orchestra. Lawing

Thefts leave campus uneasy

Davidson students might be the of-
fenders. Officer Ronnie Hersey re-
minds students that even if an act
is done by a friend from another
school, “students are responsible
for guests’ actions.”

Campus Police stated that over
the course of the past year, stu-
dents have reported over $7,000
in property damage resulting from
ambiguous and possibly criminal
behavior. This figure includes van-
dalism of two vehicles and the theft

Tution rises
despite

budget cuts

ALEX KOWALESKI
Staff Writer

The total yearly cost of a Da-
vidson education will increase

_ from $42,950 to $45,030, or
’ 4.8 percent for the 2009-2010

achool year. This increase is
composed of a $1,645 tuition
jump, and an additional $435 in
combinedcharges for a double
room and full meal plan.

According to President Tom
Ross, the economic recession
and a sharp decrease in the
value of Davidson’s endow-
ment necessitated this increase
in tuition, despite efforts to cut
expenses.

Davidson’s revenue comes
from three sources: tuition, do-
nations and a payout from the
endowment equal to five per-
cent of its five-year rolling av-
erage. Donations and auxiliary
revenue make up 18 percent of
the college’s revenue, with dis-
tribution from the endowment
covering 24 percent.

Tuition pays for the remain-
ing 58 percent of expenses.
However, between June 30 and
Dec. 31 of 2008, the value of
Davidson’s endowment fell by
28 percent. The economic situ-
ation may also leade to a de-
crease in donations. These fac-
tors necessitated the increase in
tuition.

Due to the adverse econom-
ic conditions, Davidson is tak-
ing significant steps to reduce
expenses and thereby minimize
the increase in tuition. The 2009
fiscal year budget has been cut
by 2.5 percent, and the 2010
budget will include a three per-
cent reduction.

Combined with a freeze
on “hiring, salaries and wages
at current levels, these actions
have allowed the school to min-
imize expenditures,

Despite these efforts, Presi-
dent Ross wrote in his Feb.
2009 letter to parents regard-
ing tuition that “the college is
facing escalating costs that are
beyond our control in energy,
health care and information
technology.”

In total, however, the col-
lege has been successful in
managing costs, and the 4.8
percent increase in tuition is the
lowest percentage in six years.

According to President
Ross, spending and revenue de-
cisions always put students first.
“The priority is to not allow the
economic situation to affect the
student experience,” he said.
