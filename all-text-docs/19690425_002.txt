‘Copping Out’ On Co-eds

It appears that the strong voice
for coeducation expressed earlier this
vear has faded away, if the response
to the upcoming exchange with Ran-
dotph-Macon is any indication.

The visiting ladies so far have been

welcomed about as warm neartédly

as the Black Death of 1664.
In general. two complaints have

Time Lapse
Reporting

We goofed last week. miserably.

It is what every editor fears hap-
pening. what he has a nightmare
about. what he most dreads. THE
DAVIDSONIAN ran the announce-
ment of Daylight Savings Time a
week early.

We apologize.

But we couldn't help laughing a
bit, either.

The Presbyterian Church reported
the largest attendance in ages at Sun-
day School as students, thinking it
was 11 a.m. when it was actually 10,
showed up an hour early for church.

The Union Cafeteria could not be
convinced that DST was not in effect,
and proceeded to close up at 8 a.m.
despite protests from hungry stu-

ents.

And in a perverse sort of way, the
staff finally received some vindication
in the knowledge that students do,
after all, read THE DAVIDSONIAN.

Because of which, we'll be more
careful next time.

P.S. DST doesn’t really begin this
week, either. It’s all a communist
plot, and couldn't really be real, be-
cause, as one North Carolina farmer
noted, “With that extra hour of sun
a day, all my crops will be burned up.”

been lodged against the plans for
the coed week. First, that the publici-
ty for the week was poor. and second-
ly, that the week is going to be a
great inconvenience to the students.

Seemingly the answers to these two
charges are simple.

To the firs, tt can be said fairly
that the sentiment in favor of a co-
educational set-up of some sort has
ranged from great to overwhelming
all year. It was only natural that the
committee wotild assume a large re-
sponse to be inevitable.

The second charge reflects a rather
childish attitude. It was necessary that
one group of students (i.e. two dormi-
tories) move out during the week so
that the girls could be housed on
campus. To house them off-campus
would spoil a large part of the- co-
educational experiment.

Certainly the students involved in
the move will be inconvenienced. But
the effect of one week of mild incon-
venience will certainly be more pleas-
ant than the effect of a refusal to
house the girls after plans have reach-
ed such a final stage.

The complaint of Richardson oc-
cupants is partly understandable,
since they must move out for dance
weekends, too, but that of residents
of Little is not. Their protest has
forced the planning committee to
place the girls in two very old and
shabby dormitories.

The effect of that refusal has only
served to enhance the popular theory
that students here have degenerated
into selfish and country-clubbish up-
per middle-classers who care only for
their own well-being.

In short, the response to the week
has indicated that coeducation is no
longer in very great demand at Da-
vidson, for it would upset the bal-
ance of the current social system.

A Salute To The Colonel

The colonel is moving on. After
five years at this institution and over
thirty years in the Army, Colonel
Frederick B. Outlaw, USA, is reenter-
ing the civilian sphere.

Gruff, half scowling, the colonel
presents a fearsome aspect to the un-
knowing freshman. Paid by the Army.
Assigned to Davidson College. Some
men would treat it as “just a job.”

But the colonel has always made
it his business to act primarily not
for the Army, not for the College,
but for the individual. This is not to
say thaf he acted in opposition to the
Army or the College, but that he
placed the highest value on the stu-
dents he counseled and assisted.

He adapted instructions to best meet
the needs of the students. He demand-
ed top performance of his instructors.

The Right

Cornell University President James
A. Perkins is to be commended for
the stand which he took after gun-
carrying students occupied a univer-
sity building for 36 hours.

Perkins told a convocation Monday
that further occupation of buildings
would not be tolerated and that no
more guns would be allowed on the
campus.

But it was the manner in which
he spoke, rather than the content of
his speech, which is particularly ad-
mirable, for his address represented
not administrative hostility to the stu-
dent takeover, but a genuine concern

He was flexible in helping students
work out programs that fit their needs,
inflexible in his determination to go
to bat for his students whether the
issue was insuring a student his com-
mission after a drill day prank or
appealing seniors’ assignments to in-
fantry.

Colonel Outlaw, himself a graduate
of a liberal arts college, stands out
in our view as a man who gives the
lie to those who paint men of such
military position so unfavorably.

There may indeed be such ogres in
the military, but the colonel has shown
himself to be a man of humane in-
stincts, devoted to fairness and ser-
vice to others. He is a man {o be ad-
mired. We hate to see him go but
wish him well wherever he goes.

Response

and open willingness to communicate
with the students.

Police were called to the campus
only when it was discovered that the
100 students emerged from the build-
ing with rifles, but no action was
taken, since the guns were not loaded
and thus no laws were broken.

The manner in which the adminis-
tration, especially Perkins, handled
the Cornell situation could serve as
an example to be followed by other
campus officials acress the country.

A willingness to share ideas com-
municates much better with a hostile
student than club-swinging policemen.

Delapidated Dorms

In Watts, the wood is so rotten it
won't hold nails.

In Duke, it is necessary to walk
through the showers on third floor
to get trom one side to the other.

In Richardson, you can’t depend
on the clocks working, but on the
other hand, unless you live in either
Richardson or Little, there aren’t any
clocks.

Windows in Belk look as if they
haven’t been cleaned in a year.

It’s easy.enough to go on, chronicl-
ing how in instance after instance
the dorms are decadent. Watts had
a sign up earlier in the year saying,
“Watts is YOUR slum. Keep it clean.”

A student at the University of Ten-
nessee in Knoxville related recently
the psychological change a physical
change in living conditions can pro-
duce.

During the first year at UT, he had

lived in an unfinished dorm. School
had begun before work on the new
building was complete, and the build-
ing was a bit on the dull and bare
side. Conduct matched the conditions:
water fights constantly, and perpet-
ual damage.

‘The next summer the dorm was
completed, and in the finished build-
ing, damage dropped significantly be-
low the previous year’s level. The
whole atmosphere changed, and stu-
dents took care of their accomodations
when the accomodations were worth
caring for.

Plans to renovate the dormitories
this coming summer are quite wel-
come, but let us hope the plans go
far, for there is much to remedy.

Davidson may be an Ivory Tower,
but ihe story is something else on the
nside.

From Our Wire Services

LITTLE RICHARDSON, N.
C.—Early this morning seces-
sionist forces in the break-
away provinces of Little and
Richardson seemed to be
gaining the upper hand in
trench warfare with the fed-
eralist student government
forces.

The secessionist movement
had begun when the federal
student government had tried
to ‘ram those females down
our throat,” according to an
angry Little resident.

He was referring te an im-
minent invasion of female
marauders (see picture) from
distant Randy-Mac province.
Federalist agents were sus-
pected of collusion with “the
enemy.”

Feeling that their inalien-
able rights had ‘been hit be-
low the belt, representatives
from Little and Richardson
sent formal protest to the
federal officials, but met with

Student Hits Area

To The Editor:

The area exums pose a
very real problem to the
class of ‘72 and future class-
es. If anyone is to take the
proposed bibliographies seri-
ously, there is a great deal
of work to be done by the
student in preparation for
these exams.

I feel, as doés perhaps the
faculty and the administra-
tion, that the circulation of
petitions demanding the im-
mediate suspension and re-
study of the area exams are
motivated, at least partially,
by the awe of the area ex-
ams.

The motivation. however,
should not interfere in the

disappointing results.

Insults were exchanged.
Peter Hoppie, ieader of the
federal forces, was quoted as
rumored to have said that
“They probably won't share
beds’ with their wives, eith-
er,” but declined to explain
his stand.

Little and Richardson, in
the interest of fair play, of-
fered several “‘positive alter-
natives” to the use of their
land for accommodating in-
vaders.

The Little and Richardson
residents, obviously thinking
that they were being singled
out to receive the greatest
benefits, offered a “share
the wealth” plan whereby
invading females could be
housed in all the surrounding
territories.

Nearby Watts province, the
scene of violent slum riots
and rent strikes in the sum-
mer of 1966, offered to com-
ply. provided no one had to

evaluation of the criticism of
these exams; if the points
are well taken, then they
should be acted upon.

The area exams are, ad-
mittedly, an innovation at Da-
vidson College. The idea has
generated two antipodal view-
points, both adopted a priori;
the truth of the matter is that
the real value of the area ex-
ams is questionable and can
be determined only by the
careful analysis of perform-
ances of students who have
successfully passed them.

This puts the exams on a
rather “experimenta:”’ basis,
and, needless to say, it is
quite possible that such an
experiment could prove very

The plan was overturned
however, since it might have
put a strain on the provincial
Constitution’s proviso on
the ‘Doctrine of Post Mid-
night Evil.”

As the situation stood in
the early morning hours to-
day, Little and Richardson
seemed to have forced the
student government's hand,
and even provided them with
a face-saving out.

A plebiscite in neighboring
East and Cannon provinces
granted the invading female
marauders with territory
enough to sustain their needs
for a week.

Although the compromise
was viewed as ‘‘appease-
ment to the barbarians’ of
the sort which spelt disaster
for the Roman Empire, Lit-
tle and Richardson hold-outs
seemed willing to accept the
stop-gap measure.

costly and very disastrous to
an entering freshman.

A proposal such as the one
given by THE DAVIDSON-
IAN seems much more suit-
able.

The proposed program still
embodies the objectives of
the Blue Sky Committee,
but it does not break so
strongly with traditional
methods of education at Da-
vidson as does the idea of
area exams—i.e., it suo-
stantially reduces the ex-
perimental nature of the ed-
ucational policy along with
the costs involved for the
“guinea pigs."

ROBERT
PYEATT

Dear Beverly Axelrod:

The rhythms of the Return of fhe Black Man are
crashing through the shallow noise of modern litera
ture today, bringing not something new, only a re-
turn of self-conscious expression. But what is new is
that for the first time large numbers of whites, naive,
and often insensitive, are reading black literature.

reasons for this are obvious. Compare “Sout
on ie with any book on the white bestseller list
last year. The sterility and emptiness of what passes
for literature in our material middle class white
world contrast with the existential immediacy and
vital force that Eldridge Cleaver unleashes, making
“Myra Breckinridge” an insipid daydream and “The
Money Game” a poor joke.

Don’t take your standard contemporary reading
equipment when you go to read “Soul on Ice.” It re-
jects with contempt. much of what Myers Park and
Scarsdale hold dear and doesn’t look back for the
warped shallow cursing: “convicted rapist.”

It plunges into the prison crucible that settled
Cleaver and Malcolm X and makes you realize that
everywhere is a prison for the ghetto black man. He
has been operated on, his soul incised and frozen
dead until some future time when the vault will be
unlocked and men will be healed.

Much of black literature is the contact and con-
flict with enviroment that whites can read and ap-
preciate, perhaps just glimpsing what it must be like,
but cannot understand. . ; ;

There is just too much difference in the lives
that whites and blacks have lived, too many barriers
to communication. The experience of a black man in
relation to black women is too difficult for us who
have not lived it to penetrate.

And black literature is of the total human con-
dition, probing personal depths that the white can
grasp and know the pain of isolation and the feat
of empty gestures.

Cleaver’s section “Prelude to Love — Three Let-
ters” to Beverly Axelrod is beautiful and universal.
He has the deftness and personalness of Erich Fromm
in “The Art of Loving’ and the same underlying
spiritual reality.

“The Autobiography of Malcolm X” and “Soul
on Ice” are the two greatest works of black literature.
But a white person who wants to read black litera-
ture should probably start with “Invisible Man,” “The
Fire Next e,” “Notes of a Native Son” before he
reads them.

“Malcolm X” and “Soul on Ice” are the epitome
of black consciousness to this point and immersion in
this at first does not give one as complete an under-
standing as reading widely in black literature first.

Don’t begin these books with the unthinking as-
sumption that property is sacred. They deny the
sanctity of property and assume the sanctity of the
individual. The status of man belongs only to man
and can not be transferred by suburb and television
to possessions.

One reason that black students on white camp-
uses rapidly become militant is that most of these
black students come from black middie class back-
grounds, which is a world unto itself, largely cut off
from Folsom Prison and Roxbury.

When they come to the white campus they are
suddenly different, a difference they have never
known before. They are plunged into the same cru-
cibie with Malcolm and Cleaver, they are suddenly
in a shadowy ghetto environment, suddenly on the
fringes of the society they inhabit where before they

‘were in the middle.

For the first time they are cut off, estranged, sur-
rounded, struggling for a whole existence. This makes
them militant, inflexible in their demands, immanent-
ly concerned about where they are and where they
are | gaing, Fpee unwilling to Accept the patronizing

rol of those who are not immediat
with their lives. ely concerned

Black literature challenges the preconceptions
we have accepted all our lives and is a liberating ex-
perience for the chained. and straight-jacketed pro-
ducts of affluence. It will have a great effect on the
shape of man’s collective acts.

Brinkley Raps Reporting Errors

To The Editor:

I know it is not reasonable
to expect untrained and inex-
perienced reporters to meas-
ure up to the standards of
professional journalism and
I recognize that DAVIDSON-
IAN readers who have *hem-
selves been interviewed know
that reports of interviews
may in crucial details or in
overall emphasis fail to re-
semble the interviews.

Because, with others, 1
have felt victimized by mis-
representation in the past, I
have not for several years
consented to having remarks
attributed to, or quoted from.
me unless I had seen or had
read back such remarks.

My lack of consent has
not, of course, prevented this
from happening.

In the latest instance a re-
porter came to me several
weeks ago seeking informa-
tion about the Davidson AA-
UP and I directed him to the
chapter president and said
that while I was not willing.
to say anything for attribu-
tion or quotation, I was will-

ing to discuss chapter activi. .

ties and prospects as back-
ground information which
might guide asking the most
helpful questions of the chap-
ter president.

Since that time no DAVID-
SONIAN reporter has inter-
viewed the now past presi-
dent, but instead there ap-
pears today a story appar-
ently based entirely on dis-
cussion with me.

{ regard both the breach
of confidence and the inac-
curacy as failures of journal-
istic and morat judgment.
Since, however, the entire
story mentions no person
other than me, | should like
fo correct some detalls:

(1) Although the chapter
authorized a committee to ex-
plore such matters as inter-
institutional cooperation, ex-
tra - campus responsibilities,
public service and desegre-
gation of the faculty, the
chapter has not taken any of-
ficial action on these matters
even if individual members
of the chapter have made
contributions to other groups
independently investigating
similar matters.

(2) While I might speculate
on the possibility of collective
interest and recommendation
concerning various matters
now under review by vari-
ous presidential commissions
and special committees, I
would make no presumption
concerning such groups re-
leasing their findings.

Such groups are charged
fo report to the President
and | assume it will be Pres-
ident Spencer who will de-
cide whether it would be ap-
propriate fo publish the find-
ings.

Anyone might assume that
matters of deep concern to
AAUP members might evoke
their collective recommen-
dations, especially after an
intensive review of past poli-
cies and consideration of al-
ternatives.

(3) Of course, the present
religious tests for faculty ap-
pointment—which do not now
require a formal oath of be-
lief—continue to be a matter
of concern to many, and are
appropriately being reviewed
by the Commission on
Church Relation.

What I specifically called
to the attention of the report-
er was the fact that a na-
tional committee is reconsid-
ering the AAUP 1940 state-
ment on academic freedom
and tenure and there is sub-
stantial support for a new
statement of minimum con-
ditions of academic freedom
to replace a present provi-
sion which permits church
related institutions to impose
any religious tests they may
adopt so long as they are
made explicit at the time of

initial appointment.

(4) There is no doubt that
AAUP studies of faculty com-
pensation have made a very
significant contribution to the
improved economic status of
the profession across the
country.

In recent years Davidson's
compensation improvement
program has maintained or
improved Davidson's relative
position among institutions of
higher education.

The reduced rate of im-
provement last year, related
to the implementation of ele-
ments of the new curriculum
and a reduction of the nom-
inal teaching load to bring it
to the level of better institu-
tions and improve the col-
lege’s competitive position
with regard to teaching load,
does lower our relative stand-
ing in compensation.

Unless the rate of improve-
ment returns to or exceeds
the national average (last
year 7.5%), the college will
fall behind other institutions
with more aggressive ratcs
of improvement.

(3) In recent years Dav:d-
son's AAUP membership hus
usually been a substantial
majority of the faculty.

National dues for those
earning over $12,000 pér year

have recently been raised to
$25, and we have had some
decline in membership re-
newals; but national mem-
bership continues to increase
favorably.

Since all faculty members
benefit from the achieve-
ments and work of the organ-
ization, some would say that
support of the organization
is a professional obligation,
but it has long been true that
at institutions where the fac-
ulty is well compensated and
Benerally satisfied with the
local situation, there is not
much chapter zeal for aiding
the rest of the profession not
so favored.

Maybe these details will
not seem enough different
from the story to warrant
such length, but to those at-
tentive to such matters, an
essential qualifier or the tone
of emphasis makes a good
deal of difference indeed.

{ do hope that DAVIDSON-
'AN reporters wilt come to
recognize a distinction be-
tween a background discus-
ston and an interview.

For my part, I shall be-
come evefl more cautious in
talking to anyone who might
be preparing a story for THE
DAVIDSONIAN.
