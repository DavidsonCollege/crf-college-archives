Stella: A movie well worth seeing

BY CURT BICKERS

In the tradition of “Ordinary
People,” “Steel Magnolias” and “Air-
port °77,” the movie “Stella,” starring
Bette Midler, tries to delve into deep
and meaningful interpersonal relation-

ships. It offers an opportunity for overt
and unnecessarily sentimental out-
bursts by the obviously “Harlequin Ro-
mance” target audience.

“Stella” might appeal to you if you
enjoy the sight of Bette Midler’s rotund
body swaying as she tries to dance se-
ductively ona bar-top. (Remember, she
isa professional. So kids, do not try this
at home). The movie also might appeal
to you if you enjoy sitting in tark and
weeping uncontrollably or if you just
enjoy pelting those who do with black
Jujufruits.

“Stella” is the story of a wise-crack-

ing bartender whochooses the road less

traveled. She decides to raise her

daughter Jenny alone, with no help

fromny’s wealthy father. Stella and

Jenny share both good times and bad

times. They -struggle financially
et

throughout the movie, but their love
always appears to see them through.

As Jenny blossoms into adolescence,
Stella makes the hardest decision of her
life, which is to send Jenny to live with
her rich father. Stella realizes that she
cannot provide everything her daugh-
ter needs.

This decision leads, naturally, to an
emotionally charged confrontation be-
tween the mother and daughter. Tears
and beer bottles fly as Stella and Jenny
try to reach an understanding.

Stella realizes that she has to let her
daughter fly freeand be her own special

Pardon me, but I have to run to the
Union for more tissues. I’m back. That
is much better.

Bette Midler is supported by John
Goodman, playing against type asa fat,
drunken slob who portrays Roseanne’s,
oops, I mean Stella’s, loser soulmate.

Trini Alvarado, who plays Jenny, gives

re Oe
go aS
a performance that provides an incon-
sequential and brief relief to the unend-
ing hell of this movie. She does the best
she can within the script that I envision
being written in crayon on a‘ cocktail
napkin.

The third member of this monumen-
tal acting triumvirate, Midler, displays
the subtlety usually reserved for
warthogs and runaway locomotives.
She might have been a more sympa-
thetic character had it not been for her

incredibly blatant attempts at manipu-
lating her audience into spasms of tears.

Bette Midler seems to have decided
that movies like “Down and Out in
Beverly Hills” were not suited to her tal-
ents. Instead, she has chosen to make
movies like “Beaches” and “Stella” in
which she tries to “tug at the heart-

strings.” Really, Bette, you play the buf-
oe dite

foon much better than the tragic, yet
plump heroine.

So if you have $5.50 to throw down
the drain and two hours during which
you would permit yourself to be sub-
jected to this type of torture, maybe
“Stella” is a flick you should try to see.

If you really want to go to the movies,
see “Driving Miss Daisy,” or “Flash-
back.”

If you want to blubber, Stella i is the
movie for you.
