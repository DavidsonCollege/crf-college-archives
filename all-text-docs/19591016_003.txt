still in September the DAVID-
SONIAN posed this question:
Will the ‘Cats crumble if in-
juries should shift the load
from the capable shoulders of
seniors Charlie Benson and
Dave Warden?

The 1959 football season has
;reached the midpoint. Condi-
tions seem to indicate that the
jlatter part of Coach Dole’s
| warning may loom accurate.

The words “unscrupulous” and “mean’’ just don’t
quite fill the bill in describing the Spiders. They are
admittedly a tough, hard-hitting ball club, possibly the
best Davidson will play this season. But there is a dif-
ference between hardnose football and the out-and-out
dirty variety. When a team is penalized 145 yards in one
game, it’s not they were offside an inordinate number
of times.

We've seen this before. Last year, after Richmond
had edged us 27-22 on Richardson Field, the local Pest
gridders came to classes looking like they’d been on
the losing side in a knife fight. Ss

One of the chief perpetrators of the extracurricular |
activity in the line was an end named J. P. Vass. Vass

been at least partially answered
in the affirmative.

The Wildcats have not won

last week Charlie Benson's
knee injury was | severely ag-

block in the Richmond game.

This week Coach Dole gave
some frank answers to pertin-
ent questions thrown at him in
a sports staff interview.

Q: Could you at this time
make an estimate as to what
kind of record we'll end the
season with?

Q: Just how serious is Ben-
son’s loss?

A: He was our offense. The
offense centers around the op-
tion play. Tee Redding is a fine
passer but he can’t run the op-
tion, although that is certainly
no reflection on him. Morton is
a smart boy and a fine athlete
but you can’t learn to be a
quarterback in six weeks. Look
at it this way: We haven't had
an offense since the P.C. game.
Benson was healthy in the Ca-
tawba game and in the first
half against P.C. (Davidson

scored 63 .points in those six
quarters), He was first hurt in
the third quarter against P.C.

injury? Do you know when

is. His leg ig in a cast now.

matter of time. :

Q: What changes do you
plan to make in the next

A: I caii’t. say just now what
specific changes we'll make. We
will change our offense to some
extent. We'll try to run more.

you have a chance to beat?

see a sure win anywhere.

Benson, We May

A: We've always — lettered

have five boys who could let-
ter playing varsity ball. We've
always been hurt for depth
here but this year without
freshmen we're in worse shape
than ever.

Q: Hasn’t tne ruling hurt
other small schools in the con-
ference?

A: Well, it's hurt them some,
but Furman brought in 45 boys
on scholarship last year and
55 this year (Dole has around
ten freshmen receiving aid)

Q: Do you expect any
change in the ruling?
A: No, of course not. The

big schools voted it-in and it's
to their advantage to keep it
in. The big schools aren’t in-

terested in the little schools.

Q: Do you foresee any ac-
tion on our part as far as the
conference is concerned?

A: I can't say anything about
that. High administration de-
cides on our policy. My own
personal opinion is that if
scholarships don’t. go up we'll
have to affiliate with church-
supported schools like Wofford
and. Newberry and P.C. We'll
have no other alternative. But
then, we would still be in al-
most the same situation. They
would be playing boys who
barely have “‘C” averages. Our
standards are so much higher.

Q: Is your problem that
you don’t have enough schol-
arships or that you can’t get
your boys in?

A: Both.

The ‘Cats caught highly re-

first game last Saturday and
sloshed to last-minute victory
on a murky afternoon. Star
center forward Mike Laugh-

goal to break out of a 2-2
tie with only a few seconds
remaining on the clock.

Davidson drew first blood in
the initial quarter when winger

Tom Price rifled a shot into

Davidson with a perfect 5-0
record.

In. the meet Wednesday, the
brilliant’ individual perform-
ances of runners from both Vir-

ginia Tech and Catawba were
over-shadowed by the superior
depth of the Davidson team.
Virginia Tech's Louis Catagno
la and John Finch took first
and second places with times
of 23:17 and 23:21 respectively
for the four miles. Catawba’s
Richard DeVictor took third.

From then on it was al-
most all Davidson. David Gil-
mour and Bill Eckbert came
in fourth and fifth with times
of 23:30 and 24:02 to lead the
Davidson team.

Coach Heath Whittle was

after the meet Wednesday.
“They're coming along,” he
said. “Yes sir, they're doing

competition that weve had.
Catawba beat us last year,
you know. I’m real pleased
with our progress.”

Coach Whittle praised Vir-
ginia Tech's Castagnola, who
finished first. “He'll give a lot
of trouble in the conference
meet,” Whittle commented.

Davidson meets High Point
and Furman in a triangular
meet here next Friday. Coach
Whittle says
definitely a conference conten-
der. “They have a good weil
balanced team, But High Point
might beat them. High Point
beat Catawba pretty bad the

scholarships over there, too.
We should get our roughest
