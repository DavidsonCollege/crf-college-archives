Wildcat rugby
dominates N.C.
collegiate tourney

By Warren Buford

Coming off a second place
finish in the East-West competi-
tion and a week of solid practice,
the Davidson Wildcat rugby club
had high expectations for their per-
formance during Parents' Week-
end. Indeed, these expectations
were met. In front of a large of
fellow teammates, friends; and
parents, Davidson claimed first
place in the second annual North
Carolina Collegiate Rugby Tour-
nament by defeating Wake Forest
and Western Carolina.

On Saturday, Davidson
squared off against arch-rival Wake
Forest. The demon Deacons’ ag-
gressive play and high level of
competition forced the Wildcats to
take over the game. Leading. the
charge by scoring the first of five
Davidson try’s was sophomore
Scott Young, who finished off a
spectacular run by diving on top of
the ball in the try zone for five

. points. Rugby club captain Simon

Priestley added the conversion
along with two trys during the af-
ternoon.

As usual, Priestley toughed it
out in both games and played out-
standing rugby. Joining Priestley
with outstanding honors is the en-
tire Davidson team. Commendable
hustle goes to players Frank Killian,
Chris Smith, Jeremy Potter, Tom
Shelburne, Mike Ingram, and Mike
Kestler, all of whom played the
duration of both games.

Kessler, who has worked hard
as President of the Club, summed
the importance of the victory in a
few words: “Our determination
along with fan support has helped
us to compete at the highest level.
This victory has proven our domi-
nance in North Carolina rugby.”
The next home game for the Wild-
cats will beon November 19 against
Duke.

Madawg’ lostto KA early in the
playoffs, forcing them to travel the

flickerball championship versus SAE 36-20

hardroad throught the losers’ bracket

to win. Each of the five games they .

won were tough and close.

“After we lost the first KA
game,” Krause said, “that kind of
took a lot of air out of our heads. We
knew from there on out it was going
to be an uphill struggle. We knew

our backs were up against the wall,
and we just had to come up with the
wins.”

And win they did, reaching a
goal that the team had made their
primary objective for their senior
year. After playing together in so
many games and practices over the

four years, not winning the title prob-
ably would have represented a. huge
failure for the team.

“Our senior goal all along was
to win the championship,” Krause
said. “We expected to win it. We
would have been extremely devasted
if we hadn’t.”

Volleyball
progresses
during
season

By Rich Glen

Recently, the Davidson Col-
lege volleyball team has started to
come on:strong. Last weekend the
team played two matches, one
against Western Carolina and the
other against University of Ten-
nessee at Chattanooga. The West-
ern Carolina game ended in a 3
games to | loss for the Wildcats,
but the Western Carolina game
showed how.much the team has
improved this year. “We played
our best game of the year against
Chattanooga, “ says Coach Carolyn
Blake. The team ended up winning
the match’ 3 games to none. On
Friday the Wildcats were home

’ against Georgia Southern and were

victorious in that match as well. _
“We won in five games but we
really should have won in three or
four,” said Amy Bourgeois ‘98 who
returned to the line-up after a six
week battle with mononucleosis.
The Wildcats record stands at
9-21 and their conference record is
3-7. However, the team has been
playing much better in the second
half of the season. Coach Blake
added, ‘“‘We are really starting to

Moser scored once. Liz Schaper
led all goalies with an average per
match of only 1.68, which de-
creased even more with her perfor-
mance in the tournament.

With this being the first year

that the conference held post sea-
son play for the women, it was a
big step for women’s soccer in the
Southern Conference. In the past,
the womenclosed their season sim-

holding a tournament, it gives the
teams something more to work to-
