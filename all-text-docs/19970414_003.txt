vice under twenty years. This plan,
as Krentz sees it, would be more fair
because it rewards seniority.
President Kuykendall said in
an interview that he will take a
proposal to the Trustees at their
meeting this month. Also,
Kuykendall said, “Ireact negatively
to the idea that the advisory council
did not have enough information.”
Several professors worried that

adopting the plan would damage
faculty morale.

They view the benefit as part of
an “implicit contract,” said Profes-
sor of Psychology Cole Barton, at
the forum. Fellow psychology pro-
fessor John Kello concurred, say-
ing he concluded from the forum
that many professors saw the ben-
efit as a “psychological operating
contract.”

Professor of French Alan
Singerman said that adopting the
proposal may cause some faculty

members’ “feelings [to be] hurt be-
cause the commitment made to us
by the College fifteen, ten years ago
has not been kept.”

He questioned whether the
“loss of good will” among the fac-
ulty would justify the dollar amount
which would be saved.

Kello said that the benefit had
a symbolic value as well as a finan-
cial one. “This is not just another
expense item,” he said.

nis Appleyard says, “There is a na-

Three world religions were
represented at the World Religions
Forum on Tuesday night at the
Carolina Inn.

Deepa Kamath represented
Hinduism, Saadia Bhatti Islam, and
Matt Rich spoke on Christianity.
‘The purpose of the evening was
not to strike religious discord, but
to respond to the question “What
does the particular faith mean to
those who are practicing it?”

Once each person spoke on
the history of his or her faith, a
question-and-answer session fol-
lowed. The forum’s discussion
was “based on personal knowl-
edge rather than academic,” ac-

enjoyed the forum. “It was a ter-
rific outlet to discuss different
views. I learned a lot about differ-
ent perspectives.”

Kamath organized the forum

World Religion Forum recognizes diversity

as part of a spotlight on world reli-
gions. There was also a display in
the Union Gallery.

“Early this semester, I wanted
to start a Hindu fellowship pro-
gram,” she says. “Out of that dis-
cussion came the idea of the Reli-
gion Forum. My mainconcern was
that I wanted to inform people about
the misconceptions of world.reli-
gions.”

People practicing Judaism and
Buddhism were also asked to speak,
but were not present at the forum.

“T was alittle disappointed that

‘“There’s a lot of diversity, but

Judaism and Buddhism could not
be represented. That is a conse-
quence of going to a school that is
not very diverse,” says Kamath.
On the other hand, Holbrook
believes that the forum was suc-
cessful because it allowed him to
discuss the diversity that is some-
times hidden at Davidson.

are not talking about it,” he says.

The event was sponsored by
the Chaplain’ s Office and the Dean
Rusk Program. ~

ture of an implicit contract,” but
from his service on the council last
year, he understands why the cuts
have to be made:

He also says the obligations of
that contract are not necessarily
clear. “It depends on how you inter-
pret it,” he says. “What does ‘sub-
stantial tuition benefit program’
mean?” If one interprets that to
mean providing 70 percent, he says,
then the contract has not been bro-
ken.

Legally, the benefit is not a
contractual issue, because, like all
benefits, it is not written into any
employee’s contract.

Krentz, who is against the pro-
posal, says itis “hard to know” how
the adoption of the proposal would
affect morale.

He says that one of the keys to
success for Davidson is “having
faculty who are accessible and seri-
ously interested in their students.”

While not prophesying any ca-
tastrophe in faculty-student rela-
tions, he does say that “anything
that makes anyone less dedicated to
the institution is a potential dan-
ger.”

“The passage of the proposal
will undermine at least a little the
sense that the College is behind the
faculty,” Krentz says.

Associate Professor of Reli-
gion Trent Foley agrees that the
adoption of the proposal may cause
some faculty to question the
College’s dedication to them.
“Some faculty may say, ‘I give my
life to this school ... I bend over
backwards to do everything the
school asks of me.’ I can see some
faculty getting burned out and ask-
ing, “‘What’s the point?’”

Dees delivers message of tolerance and love

Director of the Southern Pov-
erty Law Center (SPLC) Morris
Dees “uses law like a sword,” said
Associate Professor of Sociology
Janet Shannon in her introduction
to his lecture on Wednesday night
in the 900 Room.

Dees displayed his strength in
his speech, pointing out numerous
cases he argued in courts through-
out the U.S.

Because we are “still judged
by the color of skin instead of by the
context of skin,” there are many
reasons to distrust the justice sys-
tem according to Dees.

Yet, “during all my years of
work, I have learned that there is
actually more we have in common
than white divides us,” says Dees.

Dees has fought a reverse dis-
crimination case in Georgia, a hate
crime case in Oregon, and many
others.

“If America is so great because
of its diversity, then why can’t we
all get along? Why are we so di-
vided? Why so many hate crimes?”
asks Dees. “Our nation is great
because of our diversity, notin spite
of it.”

now are going to be in the minority.

There is going to be an enor-
mous amount of readjustment and
the probability of riots is severe.
We have got to learn tolerance,”

says Dees.

The answer, Dees says, lies in
love. “Until we have love between
our brothers and sisters to share, we
cannot bridge the divide,” He says.

“We think love is a simple
word, but to really love somebody
means to do it despite their differ-
ences.”

Kuykendall all pointed out that this
is a particular benefit enjoyed only
by those employees whose children
will be attending college.

Kuykendall says that “morale
is complicated ... Itis at once a very
real and very intangible thing.”

Those employees who will not
enjoy the benefit may not be sad-
dened that resources are being di-
verted from a benefit they will never
use.

They may gain more generous
benefits in other areas.

At the forum many professors
seemed disappointed that the full
tuition benefit for dependents at-
tending Davidson was being re-
moved.

Council chair and Professor of
German Hansford Epes said the 100
percent reimbursement was re-
moved to mitigate parental pressure
to force an unwilling student to at-
tend Davidson because it was
cheaper.

The council also thought it
unfair that students who could gain
admission into Davidson were re-
ceiving a more generous benefit
than those who could not get in.

Representatives from the coun-

‘ cil also pointed out that the pro-

posal would allow dependents at-

tending other schools to apply schol-

arships and financial aid to the 30

per cent of tuition for which they

would be responsible. In the past,
any outside monetary awards were
subtracted from the percentage cov-
ered by Davidson.

But the council representatives
also conceded that most faculty
children would not qualify for fi-
nancial aid, though many children
of staff would benefit from the
change.
