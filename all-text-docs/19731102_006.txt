Grosch Show Opens

Interreacti

A Review

By ROGER MANLEY
Staff Writer

Laura Grosch's show in Stowe
Galleries this month provides a
rare opportunity for the relative
and inherent qualities of three
mediums of expression, pencil
drawing, lithograph, and acrylic
painting, to be compared and
readily analyzed.

This is possible because
several of the subjects, various
plant forms all, are repeated in
each of the three mediums.

Thus it is possible, for in-
stance, to see a Boston Lettuce
rendered in a large drawing,
the same lettuce rendered in a
larger lithograph, and again the
very same lettuce presented as
a still larger painting.

In each case the visible
technique remains basically the
same: the images are built of
pure colors applied in minutely
spaced lines which overlap
variously.

Where different colors cross
they interreact to produce
modeling, which in this case is
highly sculptural- we are made

aware first of the mass of the
object depicted, and then of
shape and color, and lastly, if
at all, of surface textures.

There are exceptions, notably
the relatively small drawing en-
titled ‘‘Pear Blossoms’’ but
generally the natural surfaces
of the objects are surrendered
to the cross-hatching technique.

The dominant technique
does not seem to work
equally well in all three
mediums. Indeed, largely
because of the great degree of
magnification involved in pain-
ting with the striping tool
Grosch used, the three pain-
tings seemed the least suc-
cessful of the works exhibited.

This might not have been so
apparent had the paintings
depicted subjects other than
those already represented as
drawings or prints, on the other
hand, the weakest painting,
“Fern’’, is not represented as a
drawing or a print.

I think the lithographs are
best. They display a cool,
almost electric quality (the

‘‘Asparagus’’ litho vibrates).

Unlike the drawings, in which
Grosch has confined each color-
area with a thin outline, the
prints have an open and
emergent quality, and the
colors more often mix rather
than starkly overlap.

The drawings, also, imply a
greater spirit of freedom than
do the paintings. The individual
lines have direct and
calligraphic characteristics not
found in the uniform and
unyielding lines of the pain-
tings.

The lines which unify and in-
teract in the drawings and
lithographs become rigid and
over-powerful in the paintings.

Grosch composes classically.
There is little imbalance and
the presentation is straight-

forward. Her use of background
(which, to contradict myself,
does cause exciting imbalance
in her litho ‘‘Amaryllis on Adire
Cloth’) as an integral part of
the fairly strict structure of
some of the works is_ in-
teresting: the sense of depth
normally implied by
background is here actually
denied by it.

Where the backgrounds form
a part of the content of the ob-
jects, the plants become limited
in space in a way unlike those
plants depicted against blank
backgrounds.

Altogether, it is a good show.
Laura Grosch's perceptions and
sense of form are strong, even if
her choice of techniques seems
at times a bit too over-riding.

by anything. Period.

The third member of the
resident household is Agnes’
live-in sister Claire, portrayed
by Kate Reid. The antagonizing
and often verbose alcoholic,
Claire enjoys berating Tobias
and inciting the others to anger
and verbal intoxication.

But briefly the story. Tobias
and Agnes with sister Claire
live in an upper class house
surrounded by all the jewels of
an upper class life.

Into their peacefully neurotic
existence intrude Harry and
Edna, Tobias’ ‘‘best friends in
the whole world,’ who timidly
proclaim ‘‘We were all alone. . .
and then nothing happened, but
... WE GOT FRIGHTENED.”
Coupled with this bizarre en-
trance is the advent of Agnes’
and Tobias’ daughter Julia,
home from her fourth broken
marriage.

From this point, the plot is
very simple: six people,
clustered into one house are for-
ced to face the very serious
communal crisis of duty to
one’s family versus respon-
sibility to one’s ‘‘best friends.”’

The plague which Harry and
Edna carry infests everyone
(with the possible exception of
Claire) to the extent that they
can no longer cope with each
other.

Albee leaves it at that. Edna
and Harry do leave quietly, but
that is it. We have been presen-
ted with a grim reality, the sor-
didness of superficial existen-
ces and empty communication.

Arousal, but no supplication.
Awareness but no solution,
Albee.

‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’

Shimmers

A Review

By FRANCIS TOWNSEND
Asst. Features Editor

After seeing Rupert Barber’s
new production of ‘‘A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream,” one is
reminded of the statement
which begins ‘‘A Tale of Two
Cities,’’ that it was the best of
times, the worst of times.

Certainly any consideration
at all of the student apening of a
play, really a dress rehearsal,
may be premature, but there is
a surprisingly uneven texture to
the whole effort. Such a
wavering quality may be as a
result of the unevenness of the
play itself.

Often, however, it seems that
actors and director saw which
scenes and characters im-
mediately came alive, and were
content to let the rest falter and
die. The scene in Act IV with
Theseus, Egeus, Hippolita and
the rest of the entourage nearly
died such a death.

But alongside of such wearied
interludes stand moments of
dazzling execution. Patsy Ar-
nold's consistently charming
performance of Helena, the ver-
sion of Pyramus and Thisbe, the
play within a play performed by
the rustics Hal McCoy, Frazier
Marsh, Bill Morris, Scot Reid,
Joe McMillan and Paul Welch,
provide some of these momen-

With Enc

Hal McCoy in particular
delivers a refreshingly well con-
trolled and perfectly timed
burlesque as Quince. The whole
scene is one of the really
magical instants of the play.
Most of the true magic of the
plot is done similarly well.

Graham. Smith's Puck and
Charles Palmer’s Oberon both
provide delightful renditions of
the point and counterpoint of
Fairy Land, god and sprite. A
large portion of the credit for
the graceful Fairy episodes
should be given to Carol Barber
for the costumes,and Mike
Ramsey for the set design.

The multi-leveled set with its
ability to change its character
along with the movement of dif-
ferent characters on and off the
stage, marvellously metamor-
phoses from the particularity of
Theseus’ Palace, to an Athenian
forest and finally to some
diaphanous middle ground
fairies.

In most instances the
costuming of the actors is the
only element needed to alter the
entire atmosphere of the stage
from one locale to another.

The production does at times
shimmer with magic, but then
the lapses are only made the
moreobvious. A serious problem
which becomes evident is an at-

hantment

tempt on the part of certain of
the cast, ‘to slight the im-
portance of the language of the
comedy, a tendency which
shows itself in two symptoms.
The one, perhaps of lesser im-

portance, is an apparent desire
to ignore the metric form of the

play. The comedy is written in
verses of iambic pentameter,
and no elocutionary acrobatics
can eschew that fact.

Certainly to hear a cast speak
in jingles for two hours would be
maddening, but to hear it
trying desperately to avoid
those five persistant iambs can
be similarly annoying. There is
a happy medium.

More blatently exasperating is
the frequent inaudibility of
many of the actors, and a great
deal of overly rapid delivery. It
is difficult to appreciate or
laugh, without hearing. Once
again, however, these problems
may be explained by the cir-
cumstances of an opening night
and a dress rehearsal.

Suffice to say that despite all
the vicissitudes of the produc-
tion, the evening with Puck,
Oberon and the young lovers
could be an enchanting one.

Go and see “A Midsummer
Night's Dream,” andlook forthe
magic , with Shakespeare it will
be always there for those who
want to find it.
