Making it happen

Campus rallies to support the earth

By SetH CLiIppARD

On April. 22, 1997, people
across the country will be taking
part in an event known as Earth
Day. This will be the 27th time this
event has been celebrated. In some
areas, people will petition members
of Congress to support legislation
that helps preserve and protect the
environment, while others will stage
powerful demonstrations against
corporations whose practices pose
an immense threat to the future
sustainability of our environment.

The point of all this is to get
people to wake up to the situation
humanity has brought about. That
is, to realize that the earth and all it
contains cannot suffer the abuse we
have given it — just as each indi-
vidual cannot and should not be
subject to life-threatening devasta-
tion.

Senator Gaylord Nelson was
concerned about the direction we

were headed regarding our use (or,
rather, abuse) of natural resources
in 1963. (Yes, even then there was
alarm.) So, over the years, he
worked to raise the country’s aware-
ness about the necessity of conser-
vation as an integral part of progress.

By creating aday in 1970 where
environmental concerns took top
billing on the national agenda, he
hoped to reverse the currents of
environmental destruction that had
already grown into rapids. In his
words, “Earth day achieved what I
had hoped for. The objective was to
get a nationwide demonstration of
concern for the environmentso large
that it should shake the political
establishment out of its lethargy
and, finally, force this issue perma-

nently onto the national political .

agenda. It was a gamble, but it
worked.”

Indeed, it did work. An esti-
mated 20 million Americans took
part in the first Earth day.

Davidson will continue to give

life to this event on Tuesday, April
22. Earth Day will be held on the
Union patio from 11 a.m.- 2 p.m.
There will be food provided and
live music performed by various
students.

More importantly, there will
be representatives of both on-cam-
pus and off-campus groups that
share aconcern for the environment
or are working for its preservation.
Among these groups are the Sierra
Club, Carolina Raptor Center, the
County Waste Reduction Dept., the
Economics department, Recycling
Committee, Environmental Action
Committee, and Catawba Lands
Conservancy. Students, staff, and
faculty will have the opportunity to
learn more about various environ-
mental issues, get involved in these
groups, and learn what can be done
to keep the earth in shape.

Remember, Earth DayIS ev-
eryday. The earth is our home, so
let’s keep our feet off the coffee
table.
