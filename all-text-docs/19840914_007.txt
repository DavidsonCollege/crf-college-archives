the wheel,” Griffith said.

While Yon thinks the committee may
contact other schools, study the history
of blacks at Davidson and present specif-
ic recommendations to the Tnustees in
February, Griffith remains somewhat
less definite. “We have no hidden
agenda,” he said, pointing out that the
committee’s course of action has not
been officially determined.

“We need to meet and come to a con-
census,” Griffith said. Convenient
times, structure and similar concerns are
now the focus. Griffith views his role and
Jackson’s as one of organizing “a com-
prehensive unbiased investigation of the
presence of minorities at Davidson Col-
lege.”

Yon is enthusiastic about the com-

mittee, he said, because it will not only
be advisory in nature, but it may influ-
ence action by the Trustees.

In addition to Griffith, Jackson, and
Yon, members to date include spanish
Professor J. Alberto Hernandes-
Chiroldes, psychology Professor John
Kelton, SGA President John’ Laughlin,
Associate Dean of Admissions and Stu-
dents Paula Miller, senior Janet Stovall,
Dean of Students Will Terry, senior
Atondra Williams, French Professor
Lauren Yoder and Vice-President of
Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty
T.C. Price Zimmerman.

According to Griffith, the president’s
plan calls for four students (president of
the SGA or another student chosen by
him, and a representive each from the

How To Get An Absentee Ballot

If you want to vote in the
November election and live too far
away from the precinct where you usu-

ally vote, here is how to obtain an ab-
sentee ballot.

You must be 18 to vote. Contact
the Board of Elections in the county of
your legal residence (the library has

phone books from all over the country)
and find out the requirements for ab-
sentee voting.

If you are not registered to vote in
the county of your legal residence,
many election boards allow registra-
tion by mail.

Dean Announces New Policy On Drug Use

take. First, we are employing a part-time
drug counselor. Any student who is re-
ported for use of drugs or who behaves in
an anti-social manner as a result of al-
cohol will be referred to the counselor.
After an initial interview, we will try to
determine whether this is a one time oc-
currence or an habitual thing. If the latter
is the case, we will require six to eight
sessions with the counselor for which we
will charge $10 per session.

If an incident occurs again, the stu-
dent will be evicted from college hous-
ing, continued counseling will be re-
quired, and parents will be informed. A
student who continues to use drugs will

be asked to leave school — normally for
two terms. If, after returning to college,
drug use continues, the student will be
suspended indefinitely.

“A student involved in selling drugs
will be asked to leave the college for an
indefinite period at once.

“In developing this approach to this -
problem, we have tried initially to be
therapeutic rather than punitive because
we believe that is in the student’s best in-
terest and conforms to the spirit of the
college. We hope we can count on your
support in this matter.”

The survey asked for demographic
information, student opinion, and the ex-
tent of the respondent's use of alcohol
and illegal drugs. The students selected
for the poll were chosen randomly from
the student body population. The sur-
vey’s margin of error is positive or nega-
tive 5 percent. The survey’s level of con-
fidence is 95 percent. These two statis-
tics mean that 95 out of 100 sample sur-
veys would reflect the true value of the
population, if the entire student body
were surveyed. The percentages could
vary by positive or negative 5 Percent
from their stated-values.

When asked to describe experience
with drugs, student response was as fol-
lows: 58.1 percent had not used drugs at
Davidson, 15.2 percent had ex-
perimented with, but didn’t “use” drugs,
12.1 percent had used drugs rarely, 8.1
percent had used drugs occasionally, 3.1
percent frequently, and 3.6 percent regu-
larly. The drug most often used was
marijuana, according to the survey. 92.3
percent of the respondents who said they
had used drugs said they used marijuana.

Class members helped write and con-
duct the poll. Kazee and sociology Pro-
fessor Janet Grigsby reviewed the ques-
tions to ensure they would produce reli-
able data. It was understood from the be-
ginning that the Public Opinion class had
“complete control” of the survey admin-
istration and the data, according to
Kazee.

Terry was given only the “frequency
distribution,” or response percentages,

which provided him a “picture of at-

been no way to single out particular
groups of students as drug users with this
information,” he said.

Kazee noted that the class made sure
there would be no retribution if a student
admitted to drug use. Measures taken to
ensure the confidentiality of the re-
sponses have been respected by the ad-
ministration, Kazee said.

Terry said he was “a little relieved” to
find out that the extent of the problem
was not greater. The poll results did not
alter Terry’s perception that there was a
growing drug problem on campus, he
said.

Terry said he sees the drug problem
consisting of both drug use by many stu-
dents and drug abuse by a few students.
He felt the problem of drugs on campus
must be addressed to help the individuals
abusing them. He added that he believes

drug use creates an unpleasant atmos-
phere in the college community.

Campus security officers have not
been asked to step up efforts against
drugs, Terry said. They have been asked
to be alert to drug selling, he added.

The result of the poll has been that
“we are just going to require people who
can’t handle things to get help,” said

Terry.

Of the students surveyed, 3).6 per-
cent strongly agreed or agreed that drug
use was a serious problem. Also, 48.6
percent of the respondents agreed or
Strongly agreed that the administration
should work harder to enforce regula-
tions against drug use. 33.5 percent of
the respondents agreed drug use had in-
creased while they have been at David-
son.
