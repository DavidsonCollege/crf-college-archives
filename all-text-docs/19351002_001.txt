P. HARLAN TO HEAD
HONORARY COUNCIL;

Jackson, Tenn., Man Chosen
President of Honorary
Fraternity Body

FRATS MEET BI-MONTHLY

Delta Pi Kappa, Publications Club
Is Dissolved

The Honorary Fraternity Council
elected Paul Harlan as president at a
meeting held in Chambers Building last
Wednesday night, September 25.

Harlan, of Jackson, Tenn., is a member
of the Senior class, editor of the Wild-
cat Handbook for the past year, Presi-
dent of the Forensic Council, President
of the Eumenean Literary Society, mem-
ber of the Student Council, Secretary of
the Y. M. C. A. Board of Control, a
member of Alpha Phi Epsilon, a member
of the I. R. C, agnember of the Red
and Black Masquers, a member of the
Y. M. C. A. Cabinet, Associate Editor of
the Davidsonian, and a member of the
Phi Gamma Delta social fraternity.

The schedule of meetings was among
the other business transacted at this
meeting. This schedule appears on page
five. Ten fraternities will hold meetings
the first and third week of every month
and ten will hold meetings the second
and fourth weeks. Every organization
will meet twice a month with the excep-
tion of the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet which
meets every week. There will be no meet-
ings on Thursday nights due to,the meet-
ings of the social fraternities which are
held at that time.

The Honorary Fraternity Council took
action in abolishing the local publications
fraternity, Delta Pi Kappa, because of its
inactivity within the past few years. In
accordance with this program, each hon-
orary fraternity will be given a sufficient
length of time to prove its worth to the
Student Body and to the school. If any
honorary fraternity fails to measure up
to the standards of the Council, it will
be abolished by that group. The Council
possesses this power of abolition.

The representatives of the Honorary
Fraternity Council are the presidents of
each honorary fraternity on the campus.
A list of the representatives is as fol-
lows: Phi Beta Kappa, to be elected;
Omicron Delta Kappa, Carleton Chap-
man; Sigma Upsilon, Carleton Chapman;

Former Davidson Man

Receives 0.D.K. Award

Robert Thornwell Coit, Jr., a member
of the last spring's graduating class, has
just been awarded the National Omicron
Delta Kappa Scholarship.

This award is given annually to the
man chosen by the national organization
of O. D. K. from applicants ¢rom the
thirty-six colleges and universities in the
United States. having of
O. D. K., so this is truly a great honor
both to Coit and to Davidson.

Coit came to Davidson with a fine rec-
ord from John Marshall High School in
Richmond, Virginia, and continued his
good work here at Davidson. During his
four years here, he participated in many
activities on the campus, and was elected
to Omicron Delta Kappa, national hon-
orary leadership fraternity, and to Phi
Beta Kappa. Upon his graduation, he re-
ceived the Sullivan Award, given each
year to that member of the graduating
class who has, by his influence and wogk
on the campus, rendered the most unself-
ish service.

Coit is this year continuing his study
at the Medical College of Virginia, in
Richmond, where his scholarship will be
applied,

Dr. Meyers Addresses
Students at Vespers

Dr. Charles Meyers, pastor of the First
Presbyterian church in Greensboro, was
the guest minister at the college church
hour last Sunday evening, September 29.

Dr. Meyers chose as his text Nehemiah
5:15, “And so did not I, because of the
fear of God.” What a man will not do,
he said, is sometimes more revealing than
what he will do. Excerpts from the text
follow:

Righteousness undoubtedly has its neg-
ative side, and there are certain things
that a Christian gentleman should re-
solve not to do. First, I will not be un-
truthful. To lie is the worst, and the
lowest of sins. A commandment against
lying is included in every code of ethics
formulated since the world began. John
says that “a lying tongue shall not enter
into heaven.”

I will not be unfaithful. “Stick-to-it-
iveness,” and “plain devotion to duty” are
the rarest of qualities. Fidelity is the
essence of character. The final test of
a man’s success in college or anywhere

Alumni Association Solicits
Funds For Anniversary Gift

Journal Asks Former Students to
Select Gift Towards Build-
ing Program

As the time for the celebration of the
one-hundredth birthday of Davidson Col-
lege draws nearer, added: attention is be-
ing given to plans for the parts various
interested organizations will take in this
observance. Ranking high in importance
among these is the anticipated gift of
the alumni.

In a poll being conducted by the
Alumni Journal, each member of the
Alumni Association is asked to contrib-
ute to the extent of his ability toward
making this gift one worthy of the asso-
ciation, and to vote on the nature of the
gift to be given in its name. The inside
cover of the Journal for the month of
August, 1935, is devoted to a presenta-
tion of this problem, with the proposed
gifts listed in order tha: each alumnus
may indicate his choice. In an article be-
ginning on page 3 of the same-issue of
the Journal a discussion of each of the six
proposed gifts is given, together with a
list of other needs of the college which
may appeal to some voters. _

The first need gone into is that for
an alumni scholarship system, whereby
local chapters of the Alumni Association
would endow scholarships to be given to
boys from their various communities in
order that they might attend Davidson.

The second is the need for a new
church on the campus, the vitality of
which is evidenced by the fact that the
college is no longer using the antiquated
building now standing, but has aban-
doned it in favor of the college chapel.

Third, the need for a new field house,

Music Department To
Have Heavy Schedule

Davidson College musical organizations
will have one of the heaviest schedules
of any group on this campus during the
coming year.

All three groups will be used in the
weekly radio programs will
broadcast on Thursdays, from 4:30 un-
til 5:00. In the
band will present a program of college
songs, and in the following week, the
orchestra an dglee club will take part.
The programs will also be interspersed
with sport flashes, campus news, and oc-
casional short talks. -

Prospects are also bright as far as
tours are concerned. The band will play
for the North Carolina Music Teacher’s
Clinic in Greensboro, Oct. 18, and will
take a ten day trip during the spring
holidays. This tour will probably extend
southward through Atlanta and Chatta-
nooga. The orchestra and glee club will
take a five day trip as they did last year.

The college band took its first trip
when it played for the State-Davidson
game in Greensboro. There, the band
presented an half hour broadcast over
WBIG and performed during the game.
At the half, the “D” and “S” were
formed and Julian Helms, drum major,
twirled a baton equipped with two fire
brands, the first of its kind ever to be
made,

Prof. Pfohl is especially pleased this
year with the glee club prospects. This
organization will be used in a number of
radio programs, and also in all Sunday
evening church services. The glee club
will make its trip in the spring with the
orchestra.
