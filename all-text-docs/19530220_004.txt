The years aroun 1895-32 were
hot years for the scientifically con-
scious world. The question of the
day was the question of all time:
was evolution of the species a
possibility? A man named Chartes
Darwin thought so. He had develop
ed selective hreeding of sheep and
cattle to a fine art .. . heredity
could be selective, he proved. He
then spent the better part of his
life and wealth searching Buenois
Ares and the Galapagos Islands
for some trace or clue of this miss-
ing link between the foscles and
modern man in his evolution the-
ory. But Darwin never definitely
found the answer.

The truth was the answer hadn't
yet been born. Darwin was 95 years
too early and thousands of miles
off base.

Monk McGill first saw daylight
in Fayettevile about 1930 (no exact
records of his youth were kept.)
The people of Fayetteville were
amazed at how quickly it caught
onto human habits and as a joke
entered him in a school. He's been
there ever since. This year, with
the grace of Hengeveld, he grad
uates with a polit and eco major
but not after sparking up the
campus for four long years.

Be with Monk for five minutes
and his hobby will speak for itself.

breath, He’s never at a loss for too soon. I think we've found your

paragraphs and his record of talk-
ing 9 straight minutes under water
goes without challenge. The topics
vary directly with his gaze and in-
directly with the patience of the
listener.

“Yet you can’t help but like
Monk”, is the way he so quaintly
puts it. “I just wish everyone could
have the wonderful opportunity
Horace Ball has had.” Monk goes
on to say his roomate, Horace, has
just one fault... “He tries to
keep up with me socially, and it
just can't be done.”

When Monk isn’t reading sex-
books, being the “best catcher in
the soft-ball league”, or winning
‘worst I. D. card’ contests, one can
find him sitting in a group of S.P.E.
pledges spinning yarns about you-
know-who. In a few minutes one
might pick up such tid-bits as the
time he caught his foot in a subway
as it was pulling out in New York
last year, or the time at White
Lake he dived off a.boat with a
friend to swim to shore before he
remembered he couldn't swim. He
still can't. Next he might be coaxed

into telling about his early danc-,*

ing and voice lessons, or with a
choke in his voice recall the death
of Gargantua. He never misses a
Cheeta picture, but is a bit jeal-

ous of his accent (“obviously put-,

on”). Talking to Monk was one of

Last, and far from least, you get
a look at the Davidson Spirit from
a point of view inacessible to the
undergraduate. It's not that you
forget the bad things about David-
son; they remain as a challenge to
Students and Alumni alike. But
from the perspective of a year’s
absence, you re-evaluate what
Davidson has, and what she has
given you, and you come to the con-
clusion that the good things about
Davidson compensate for her
faults. You get a feeling in your
chest you aren't supposed to have,
since in this day and age, a young
man isn’t supposed to be senti-
mental. I planned to leave Davidson
at 8:30, the other Saturday morn-
ing, but didn’t get away until 11:15.

Yipes! I've got to scrub the deck,
