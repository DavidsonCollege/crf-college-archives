Cc ne day two, weeks ago I de- .

didn’t think it would be a big deal to -

wear it to classes, meals, etc. Well, it
wasn’t, except for a few small groups
who thought I was strange, a super-
freak, or a clown. Having heard a few

laughs and snickers behind my back, I .

am writing this in response.

Come on! Where have you been
all your lives? Why is Davidson so

caught up in following the styles and ©

‘ standards of the South? How boring!
If everyone dressed alike — which is

what the preppy look seems to propo- ©

gate — we’d all be clones. Seriously,
how many aligators and topsiders can
you count in a day? Why would « ariy-
one want to wear the same ‘style of
shirt with the same logo as a million
other preps? Whatever happened to
variety?

The South is not where the styles
and attitudes are at. I think the South
is a cultural backwash compared to
the West and the North. Styles here
are decades behind the West. The
prep look, remember, is from: the
’50’s. The style is also evident, in
Beach Music, the teeny-bopper an-
thems of the ’50’s.

I hope you readers. will not as-
“sume that I am making a general accu-
sation against anyone wearing Izod
shirts or topsiders. I am addressing in
particular those who laughed at me
for wearing Pakistani clothes. It
seems to me that anyone making auto-
matic judgements about another’s
clothing — i.e. wierdo, hippy —
would do well to get a grip on reality.
You sure won’t find reality trapped in
idealistic surroundings of our tradi-
tion-bound school.
