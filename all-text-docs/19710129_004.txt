Seeing The Light

Many thoughts come to our minds in reviewing
the recent student body elections, and being editors,
we could not resist sharing a few of those with our
Teadets.

First, a comment on the quality. of the campaigns.
This year, as has not been the case in several recent
years, the candidates were motivated by issues about
which not only they but also the entire student body
was concerned.

The reality of the issues including social reform,
‘the efficacy of ea fer cae ot and editorial po-
licy of THE DAVIDSO
put forth serious platforms with serious proposals to
- answer serious student questions.

In most instances the response of the candidates
was gratifying. As a whole, the platforms were pleas-
antly realistic and well considered.

Unfortunately, in a few instances the candidates
did not deign to deal with issues solely and mounted
campaigns more immature than one might expect
from a college student.

These campaigns bordered on personal attacks
against incumbents and opponents. Such instances
were rare, but they are ones we hope will not be re-
. peated at Davidson.

And now a comment on the election results. Be-
cause of the intensity of the feelings stirred by the
recent social reforms and because many of the anti-
reform sentiments seemed to have the greatest back-
ing, few at Davidson could have predicted the over-
whe ig victories by candidates not normally identi-
fied as “profraternity.”

It goes without saying that your editors and es-
pecially the Editor-in-Chief were quite pleased with
the results of the balloting.

Yet it seems to us that the student body should
feel equally gratified at these results. Basically they
niean that the institutions in question will continue to
develop properly and under the most capable leader-
ship. ;
: In all of the races in which a big issue was made
of the fraternity system, the voters elected the candi-
dates with the greatest experience for the position.

The campaigns as it turned out did not hinge
on one issue but on the qualifications of the candi-
dates. The voters rejected the emotional appeal and
with it rejected the amateurism which threatened
several positions when candidates tried to ride the
emotional appeal into office.

For thus validly selecting candidates by compet-
ence, the voters are to be congratulated.

No More Vietnams!

“It’s quiet. Too quiet. I don’t like it.” These words
lifted from hundreds of the worst jungle, war, and
cowboys and Indian movies ever made might well
descriine the situation on American campuses since
the beginning’ of the school year.

It may be that we are feeling’ the calm before a
storm, but we certainly hope that such is not the case.
Or it may be, as one student here recently suggested,
that the days of the neurotic student are passing and
that rising students are silent only by virtue of being
psychotic.

Seriously, however, there seems to be little evi-
dence that events in South East Asia have become
sane enough that we bye Bae ignore them as the
silent campuses seem to be doing.

In spite of the Cooper-Church amendment, it has
been revealed recently that ‘pistol-packing squads of
American “helicopter salvage” experts dressed in
their civvies have been found prowling around the
Phnom Penh airport. Their“presence has been only
ag a ee explained.

et such inadequate explanation is possible only
as long as the public will pu oe with it. Perhaps now
would be a good time for the campus to ‘make a little
noise and try to pry:the truth ‘about the situation out
of the Defense Department.
A little noise now would certainly be better than
a lot of Cambodianization a few years from now.

The Job Interview Game
“- And How To Play It

“Hello there, you’ must
be...’ The young execu-
tive type calls out, simul-
taneously extending a hand
to shake.

You complete his sentence
by pronouncing your name
in a moderately _resonant,
‘‘radio’’ voice and shake his
hand firmly, making sure to
look him in the eye and
flash a toothy salesman
smile to prove your confi-
dent competence.

Suitably introduced, you
are ready to begin a game
in which you are 4 pawn
and your partner is king.
‘The game is known as the
Placement Interview.

The first phase, called
foreplay, consists of shoot-
ing the breeze on your home-
town, whatever you might
have in common with.the in-
terviewer, or any other in-
nocent. topic. This phase is
fairly standard but from
there the game can take
many directions.

Dozens of dippy facts
about the particular com-
pany are often delivered in
dead earnest: ‘‘Ace is the
largest trucking company
this side of the Chattahoo-
chee!"’ ‘‘Money ‘Back Bank
offers more check colors

than any other bank in the.

Yubangee area!"’ As though
you care...

Insurance companies can
be. counted on to play up
their role tn “helping peo-
ple solve problems” and
sometimes seem to be more
charitable institutions than
money-making businesses.

But somehow a Davidson
education doesn't motivate
one. ‘to. seek employment
selling life insurance, tow-
els, or toothpaste despite
companies’ big ‘hames.

(Banks account for more
than a third of the recruitors
visiting Davidson and de-
_serve special attention in
| this survey.

“What makes you _ think
you can he a bank-
er?’ is the general gist of
the question usually popped.
Unless your major is econo-
mics, the implication — is
more specific, ‘‘how do you
expect us to hire you with
that major?”’

Being ‘a _ conversation

game, Placement Interview
success depends not only on
your paper’ qualifications
but also on your ability to
shoot (or shove) bull. It can
be a matter of the right line
for the right company.
‘ It’s reminiscent of rush;
you find out what they want
and convince them you've
got two of them.

But it’s a buyer’s market
these days. Companies can
pick and choose. If you were
hooked by the liberal arts
line, your job opportunities
may be sunk by those Caro-
lina business administration

majors. ;

The main reason the ma- °

jority of Davidson graduates
go on to further study may
not be competence after ail;

but incompetence. Most of
us just aren't trained to do
anything useful. And most
prefer further study to im-
mediate milatary service.

All this is intended to com-
municate not so much cri-
ticism as reflection.

After. several bank repre-
sentatives emphasize the
necessity of dropping ‘‘ideal-
ism" for cold, hard business
amoralism, you may well
decide your life. work isn’t
to be a branch manager.

But as '71 is a bad time to
look for work, you play the
game.

It all makes you want to

Students Rowdy
At Bloomfield

Intercollegiate Press

Bloomfield College, which
had relaxed in recent years
Strict ‘‘in .loco  parentis”
Standards for student
conduct, has been forced by
the current conflict with
neighbors “and the town to
seek a middle ground be-
tween rigid control and per-
missiveness.

“Like most’ colleges,
Bloomfield began to treat
its students as_ responsible
adults about five years ago,"
said Dr. Paul Sherburne,
dean of students. ‘‘In place
of control, the college now
has to develop means of
guidance if it wants to ful-
fill its responsibilities to the
students.

“Obviously, the present
difficulties with the town
gave this process a higher
priority for us. (But it’s
something we would- have
had to cope with eventual-
Var!

Dean Sherburne has added
a new responsibility to the
duties of undergraduate re-
sident advisors. Starting
this year, they will inform
resident students about town
ordinances governing. their
behavior.

‘In the past, the dean ex-

plained, resident ‘advisors
concerned ‘themselves only
with college orientation —
helping new students with
academic and personal pro-
blems. ‘‘The college has al-
ways recognizéd its respon-
sibilities in that area,” he
said.

>

“We are now faced—with
the necessity of reminding
them that they are citizens
of Bloomfield and informing
them of the duties that in-
volves."’

Town ordinances, which
prohibit undue noise after
11 p.m. and generally at-
tempt to define limits of Be-
havior jin a quiet, residen-
tial community, are what
Dean Sherburne wants stu-

dents to know.

“The problem never exist-
ed in the past, because the
college's rules were always
stricter than the town's" ‘he
said.

Bloomfield College was
once a Presbyterian Semin-
ary and ,until recentiy, re-
mained a smalt school with
strong traditions. But in the
past 10 years, the student
population and its programs
have grown and diversified.

Dean Sherburne warned
that ‘the college may revise
its attitude toward students
who. violate municipal or-
dinances. ‘A college sets
standards of conduct which
reflect its needs. When a
student engages in conduct
deleterious to the college,
it must sometimes sever the
relationship with that stu-
dent,’ Dean Sherburne said.

“Theoretically, it makes
no difference to a school if
one of its students is arrest-
ed for disorderly conduct. It's
his business. But in the cur-
rent situation, political fac-
tors may indeed make it de-
leterious to the college.”

Mean Sherburne said se-
veral committees within the
college will attempt to de-
fine what forms of civil mis-
behavior can have a harm-

_ful effect on the college.

‘And, he indicgégd, students
convicted of breaking local
ordinances, may face dis-
ciplinary action by the col-
lege.

He said, however, the col-
lege has‘ no intention of try-
ing to enforce local ordin-
ances. ‘‘We have no need
for a rule that restricts
noise after 11 p.m. on‘é Fri-
day night."

If we did, we’d make one
and enforce it. That rule
comes from the town and the
town “has to enforce: it.

‘We can only inform our
students of the law and trust
their maturity and good
judgment in the present sit-
uation.”
