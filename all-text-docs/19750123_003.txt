(Ed. Note: This article is the first in-
stallment of a two-part series con-
cerning admissions and financial aid.)

Davidson College officials have
decided to readjust the admissions and
financial aid policy in light of the grim
economic forecast for fiscal year 1975-
76.

College administrators will have to
locate at least $200,000 in extra revenue
to finance the revised 1975-76 financial
aid program.

“If we could get a $200,000 increase in
the scholarship budget, I would be
delighted, ”” remarked Director of Ad-
missions and Financial Aid H. Edmunds
White.

“There will be some increase in the
endowment, but surely not enough to
cover our financial aid needs,” con-
tinued White.

White was not sure how much money
would be needed to cover financial aid
costs for 1975-76. Also, he was not sure
how the needed revenue would be ob-
tained.

“It’s obvious that we have to have it,
and I think we’ll get it. I believe we’ll get

a substantial increase in scholarship ,

aid.

“I think the Trustess will try hard, as
they have in the past, to give a high
priority to financial aid,” continued
White.

The Board of Trustees will meet at
Davidson on February 21 to discuss the
1975-76 budget.

Besides asking for a financial aid
budget increase of $150,000 to $200,000
during the upcoming budget hearings,
White has announced two important
policy changes.

First, as compared with the Class of
1978, ten to fifteen fewer applicants who
require substantial financial aid
packages will be denied admission to the
Class of 1979.

““We’re also going to increase our ex-
pectations of all students’ summer ear-
nings by $100,’’ said White.

“‘We must have within the next three
weeks at least tentative figures that will
enable us to- make budgetary
decisions,’’ said Spencer.

A problem basic to any financial aid
program concerns the method of
distribution of financial monies, ac-
cording to Spencer.

“‘One of the basic problems is a policy
decision as to whether to try to meet the
full need of a limited number of students
or the partial need of a greater num-
ber,” he said.

Based on the 1974-75 expense budget of
$4,400 per individual, an enrolled
student who requires total financial aid
receives the following aid package:
$2,500 in financial aid; $1,000 from a
loan; $500 from a campus job; and $400
from the student’s summer earnings.

In 1974-75, only 15 students received
scholarship aid of $2,500 or more. Listed
in this category are two’ seniors, six
juniors, no sophomores and seven fresh-
men. (See Chart).

“For every total need case you
eliminate three to five half-need cases,”’
remarked White. As Spencer men-
tioned, decisions as to which type of |
financial aid policy will be elope
“must be made.”’

College administrators indicate that
the structure of. any financial aid
program is grounded on various value
assumptions.

“It is obvious that Davidson caters to
a group of financially elite,’”’ remarked
Vice President for Academic Affairs
Johm M. Bevan at the Tuesday meeting
of the Budget, Building and Grounds
Committee.

Bevan indicated that Davidson would
be unable to admitt students from low in-
come families if the college policy con-
cerning admissions was altered.

He argued that Davidson is able to of-
fer grants of substantial aid to some
students because a large percentage of
Davidson students require no financial
aid whatsoever.

According to Davidson ad-

ministrators, various agencies such as
the College Scholarship Service (CSS)

Further, the Financial Aid office will
offer a higher percentage of loans and
jobs rather than scholarships to stu-
dents next year as opposed to this year.

Although White has stated that at
least $150,000- $200,000 in increased
revenues is needed to meet 1975-76 finan-
cial aid expenditures, he has not yet
provided other administration officials
with a definite budget projection.

College President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. urged the Admissions and Financial
Aid offieials to provide him with’ con-
crete figures concerning the financial

aid budget.

suggest guidelines for financial aid
policy.

“Every year for many years, the CSS
has provided colleges with financial
tables estimating parents’ expected con-
‘tributions toward college expenses,”
said White.

‘‘Three years ago, the CSS tables were
way too tough; they expected from the
parents far more than they could
possibly contribute.

“To adjust parents’ pontrieiinaa toa
fairer level, we met with many other
colleges in Chicago to draft a new set of

guidelines,’’ continued White.

No college is obligated to abide by the
CSS guidelines.

In calculating parents’ expected con-
tributions in 1975-76, Davidson ad-
ministrators are again disregarding the
CSS tables.

“The premise that we operate on is
that we expect the parents to con-
tributed what they are able to contribute
plus sacrifices. :

“‘The CSS now has come up with tables
which expect less from the parents than
most financial aid officers think is
reasonable and than most colleges can
afford,”’ said White.

The CSS 1974-75 tables were read-

‘justed because of projected inflationary

trends in the economy. For parents, the
amount of money available for expenses
(above regular living costs) have
greatly decreased, admits White.

Admissions officials to Davidson have
not yet decided on the financial aid for-
mulas which will be used for the 1975-76
academic year.

“We will arrive at some compromise
of the CSS tables,”’ said White.

As noted above, some definite
decisions concerning the composition of
the Class of 1979, have already been
made.

The 10 to. 15 border-line admissions
cases who will be denied entrance into
the freshman class will most likely be
white males who require substantial
financial aid grants.

“‘We want to treat studens equitably
in relation to each other, but-we want to
preserve the college’s resources so next
year’s class’ tuition doesn’t go up.

“We have a policy of giving special
consideration to sons and daughters of
alumni, to football and _ basketball
players, and to member's of. minority
groups when comparing border-line ad-
missions cases,’’said White. ~

According to the Davidson Self-Study

Report, the statement of purpose which

ghides admissions officials reads:

“Davidson must always seek students
of character, of general as well as
academic ability, of loyalty to the ideals
of the college, and of promise for future
usefulness.”’

Financial aid officials at Davidson
award funds on the basis of financial aid
needed.

“I believe very strongly that when
there is a situation of limited funds,
scholarships should be based on need,”’
argued White.

Not all financial aid officials accept
White’s position on scholarship aid. ‘‘I
will debate the director of admissions
from Vanderbilt University on this very
issue in February,’’ remarked White.

Alumni scholarships totalling $116,000
are granted to about 150 students who do
not qualify for competitive scholarships.

The McConnell and Dana ‘Scholar-
ships are granted on the basis of merit,
but the amount awarded to recipients of
these scholarships is based on financial
need.

in the 1973-74 academic year, the ex-
pense budget for the Office of Ad-
missions and Financial Aid totalled
$129,441.

The expected expenses for the current
year are $132,800. The proposed budget
expenses for 1974-75 are $135.630.

_When asked of his philosophy on
financial aid and admissions .
White replied, ‘‘We have to start with the
fact that we have a limitation of funds.
The only way we could avoid that is a fan-
tastic increase in the endowment ear-
marked for scholarships or a fantastic
raise in student bills.

“Davidson, being relatively small,
doesn’t have; what I would call a
heterogeneous student body, but we do
want people who will be interested in
various areas and who will. make con-
tributions in various areas.”’
