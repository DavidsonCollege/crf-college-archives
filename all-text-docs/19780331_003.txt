Hankins visualizes literary magazine

by CLAY MACAULAY
Staff Writer

With the folding of Inklings,
a number of students are dis-
cussing the advent of a new
literary magazine this spring.

“All we have now are floating
ideas,’’ said Media Board
Chairman Greg Hankins, “‘but
a number of people in private
poetry groups have indicated
their interest to me in having
one.”

Hankins added that the Un-

ion Poetry Committee also likes.

the idea.

Inklings, which published on- —

ly works by freshman class
members, printed its final issue
in the Spring of last. year.
According to Professor of En-
glish Georgianna Ziegler, Ink-
lings was costing too much, and
interest was low in the project.

She pointed out, however,
that the R. Windley Hall award

National and world news

‘will continue to be given to the

most creative freshman writer,
and said that some back issues
of the publication were available
through her office.

Hankins visualized the new
publication as being less formal
than Inklings or The Miscel-
lany, by describing it as ‘‘a
tabloid with a broad base.”

Hankins hoped this broad
base would allow more writings
to be published and would

Israeli cabinet tinoke Begin

Israel: Prime Minister Begin
received the full backing of his
cabinet upon his return from thie
U.S. and talks with President
Carter last week. Begin and
Carter failed to reach an agree-
ment on key Middle East
questions during the Washing-
ton talks.

Tuesday Begin announced his
willingness to resume peace
talks with Egypt, promising a
more conciliatory position to-
wards the Palestinians. Defense
Minister Weizman is expected
to be sent to Cairo to reopen
negotiations.

Lebanon: While UN peace-
keeping troops carefully move
into Southern Lebanon, scat-
tered PLO attacks continue. So
far, the guerrillas in the area
have resisted all attempts for a
cease-fires. While PLO leader
Arafat has agreed to support
UN peacekeeping efforts, it is
not sure how much control
Arafat has over the guerrillas in
Southern Lebanon.

Venezuela: President Carter
began his week-long Third
World Tour Tuesday talking to
Venezuelian President Andres
Perez. The major issues to be
discussed will be human rights,
energy, and South American
politics.

Carter will be received Wed-
nesday in Brazil, and then

proceed to Africa. Carter’s over-
all objective will be to im-
prove U.S.-Third World rela-
tions, as well as gain support

Panama Canal: The Senate
ratification vote on the second
part of the treaty has been set
for April 26. This part. of the
treaty deals with the actual
return of the Canal to the

Washington— After ' striking
coal miners ratified a new
three-year contract last Friday,

union and industry officials put
an end to the 109-day coal strike
by signing the contract Satur-
day night. Among the provi-
sions of the contract are a 39
percent increase in pay and
fringe benefits for the union
through 1981, a revised health
care program allowing fewer

. free benefits to the miners and

their families, and an abdication
by the union of its demands for
a “right to strike’’ at local
mines by simple majority vote.

“subdue the chicken factor’’ in
many of the writers at David-
son.

Poetry is not all that is to be
published in the new tabloid;
short fiction essays, and even
critiques of other poetry are also
planned. “We would even like
to print pictures of art work and
photos of expressive scenes, but
I’m not too sure how it would
work out,’’ said Hankins.

The Poetry Committee, Han-
kins, and others hope these
“floating ideas’’ will materia-
lize, and that the new literary
publication will be a reality by

the end of spring term. Hankins

has talked with Davidsonian
Production Manager Amanda
Hall about possibly doing the
type setting for the new project,
and pointed out that negotia-
tions have been made with
Davidsonian editor Philip Dun-
can about the possibility of

using the Davidsonian typeset-

Hankins’ main concern, how-
ever, is funds for the project
and student support. ‘For it to
be a success we would have to

_ include a broad base of writing

which would involve a number
of people,” said Hankins, and
added that he hoped to talk
with the Publications Board on
March 15 about possible funds
for the magazine.

The hope of the people behind
the project is that it will
encourage students to publish
their work.

“A lot of students at David-
son College are closet poets, and
I believe that if the students feel
it is worth the time and effort to
write it down, it is not that
much more egotistical to want it
published,’’ Hankins con-
cluded.

Conservation effort
Saves paper Cups

By ROGER BROWN
Staff Writer

Davidson students have
saved close to 100,000 paper
cups since early in winter term.
The effort simultaneously has
raised close to $1000 for CROP,
an organization which attempts
to alleviate hunger and mal-
nutrition overseas.

The cup drive is a product of
the arrangement between stu-
dents and Slater Food Services.
Slater Director Ron Scott a-
greed to begin using paper cups
rather than plastic since waste
paper is degradable, and he also
agreed to give a share of his
savings for each cup saved.

During the fall term each
student eating at Slater used an
average of 3.4 cups per meal, or
a total of about 15,000 each
week. The cups not only repre-
sented an enormous waste, but
also cost the food service $1.29
each—almost $200 each week
just for cups. With the current
arrangement, CROP receives 1
cent per cup saved, and Slater

‘College funds will not be
‘used for this purpose. ‘The
college is not going to get into
the retirement business,’’
Currie added.

The funding for the project
will be private, consisting of
capital from investors and a
regular mortgage loan from a
financial institution, Currie ex-
plained.

retirement project

“The project must be well-or-

ganized and well-capitalized,”’
commented Spencer. ‘‘Prentiss
is to organize a corporation to
build and operate the commu-
nity.”
“There will be about 100.
apartment units along with
complete dining services. Nur-
sing facilities may also be
established, but they will run
independently from the retire-
ment center itself,’’ Spencer
concluded.

saves about $25 each week.

Jim Haynes coordinated
much of the planning and
publicity for the drive. ‘I was
uncertain at first about how
students would react, but the
response has been great. We've
been saving about 10,000 cups
each week and have reduced the
average number per person to’
just a little over one each meal.”

Haynes has two primary
concerns: “‘I want the support
to continue growing. A lot of
people still use three cups at a
meal, and many have never
started bringing their own
glasses.

Also, I would like to see other
organizations on campus push
the idea.”’

Some support has been
shown by participants in the
CROP meals and at the Depot
luncheons; Haynes hopes this

' support will broaden. He sug-
gested that eating houses cut
down on the use of paper plates
and cups.

Also, using waste paper for
homework would be a start
towards reducing waste.

Steve Holman, another or-
ganizer; commented, ‘‘As much
as anything, we're trying to
create an awareness of the
problem of waste and the poten-
tial that we as consumers have
for reducing the amount of
garbage we impose on the
environment.”’

Holman has also worked for
the glass end paper recycling
which began recently.

The cup drive has shown that
innovative ideas and coopera-
tion can have an impact. As
Haynes said, ‘‘Many conserva-
tion schemes have such minimal
effect that they won’t hold
water; 100,000 paper cups will.”
