IFC Hears

By Freshman Couneil |'

The major business of the In-
terfraternity Council Monday
might was concerned with the
changes in rush regulations pro-
posed by the Freshman Coun-
ceil.

In regard to the request for
freshmen to hitchhike after 11
p.m. in upperclassmen's cars,
the IFC established an under-
standing that upperclassmen
may give rides to freshmen to
the campus after 11 p.m.. pro-
viding that the ride is not pre-
- arranged.

The IFC clarified further the
rule concerning transportation
of freshmen's dates to campus.
The council agreed that fresh-
men dates may ride with upper.
classmen’s dates as long as the
arrangements are made between
the girls concerned and not by
the Davidson freshmen and up-
perclassmen.

The freshmen may also apply
to the IFC Transportation Com-
mittee to approve arrangements
for transportation of their dates
in extenuating circumstances.
This comes under the old trans-
portation rule and questions and
requests should be made to Stan
Brown (Duke 136) and Dave Per-
tin (Belk 460).

The Freshman Council request
vo delay acceptance of bids until
a few days after Christmas
break could not be acted upon
to the Interfraternity Council as
this rule was set up by the Fac-
ulty Committee on Fraternities,
Clubs and Social Life.

In response to the last re-
quest of the Freshman Coun-
cil, the IFC will have represen-
tatives at Freshman Council
meetings in the future to answer
any questions which should arise
concerning rush regulations.

In discussing homecoming
decorations, the council said

Goal

Davidson's ‘‘Great Guys” con-
tributed more than. $1,300 to the
YMCA's annual fund drive to
put the Y over the top in this
year’s goal of $3,500.

Some 120 YMCA _ volunteers
participated in the drive which
actually began last weék with
the placing of ‘Are You a Great
Guy.” signs in conspicuous’
places about the campus.

Yesterday's activities began
with the placing of leaflets un-
der the doors of all rooms, ex-
plaining the Y's activities and
goals for the year.

Banners and posters were dis-
played in numerous spots around

campus. Yesterday's chapel
was used to remind students of
YMCA Day.

The funds raised wil! be used
¢o support both student and com-,
munity work, including the
YMCA Forum, Great Issues,
Book-of-the-Year, Freshman
Camp and the Gift Fund.

Each student was asked to
contribute $5 toward the $3,500
goal. Contributors were given
a YMCA membership card en-
titling them to use any YMCA
facilities in the United States.
Contributors also wore GG
(Great Guy) buttons which
could be seen in abundance be-
fore the day was over.

LOGAN LOSES TRADITIONAL COOLNESS.

“God, I'm Happy”

Logan’s ‘Wanda Foreaw’

Causes Pandemonium

By ALLEN WEBB
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Near pandemonium broke
out in Duke Dormitory Sun-
day afternoon when senior
Bill Logan learned that
Charlotte radio _ station
WIST had named him the
winner of $1,240 in its
“Name the Girl on the Bill-
board” contest. .

Naturally Logan was the hap-
piest one of them all and some-
what surprised too. Although he
did not think he would win, he
had tuned in precisely to hear

Anti-Communist Tells *
Of Spread Of Marxism

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Dr. Karlis Leyasmeyer is sort
of down on Communists. At
least he seemed that way Wed-
nesday night at Open End, when
he called the rise of Communist
power “the greatest tragedy that
human history has experienc-
ed.”

Dr. Leyasmeyer has had some
personal experience with Com-
munism. After barely escaping
from the 1917 Revolution in Rus-
sia, he was driven from his
homeland of Latvia by the Nazis
and Soviets during World War IT.

Since coming to this country
he has been a leading anti.Com-
munist speaker, and his visit to
Davidson certainly proved him
to be a dedicated and persuasive
crusader,

Expressing grave concern
about the possibility that the
Communists will finally emerge
victorious, he outlined their poli-
cy of infiltration and takeover
of underdeveloped countries and
encirclement of industrialized
nations.

“We are not sure whether we
will win in Asia, and Africa is
not much better.”

Claiming that “the situation in
our own hemisphere is much
worse.” Leyasmeyer continued,
“Tf Brazil is taken over by the
Communists there is no question
that the rest of Latin America
will go the same way.”

The lecturer then described
the original economic views of
the Communists, stressing that
““there is one trouble (with Com-
munist economic theory), and it
it this: Environment as such
cannot produce basic changes in
human nature.”

Thus, Lenin. saw that Marx's
idea that; commusism is inevit-

°

able was wrong and the Rus-

slan leader realized that the
Communists must guide history
along their lines by the use of
dynamic, trained men to foster
revolution and implant Commun-
ist ideology in the minds of the

people.

According to Leyasmeyer,
“Lenin certainly discovered the
paramount importance of ideas.
This has been our great trouble:
We think we can buy people,
while the Communists win their
minds.”

He noted: ‘“‘The moral disinte-
gration among leading circles”
is the major factor making the
take-over by the Communists a
real threat. “The situation is
hopeless unless there comes a
radical change.’”’ He saw re-
ligion as the only hope.

Numerous complaints
about poor food and service
continue to hound Harry S.
Hill, cafeteria manager, as
he faces one of the biggest
catering weekends of the
vear, with four separate
luncheons to serve tomor-
row.

The cafeteria, which is re-
sponsible for catering on cam-
pus whenever there is room,
has been asked for luncheons
for an Alumni Leaders confer-
ence and a cenvention of for-
eign language teachers.

In addition, it must prepare

spectators, and a box supper

the announcement of the win-
ner.

The station had inittated the
contest in August as a promo-
tional stunt with the display of
the nameless girl's picture on
billboards all over Charlotte. A
fetching blond, reclining while
wrapped in a towel, she attract-
ed the eye of many a pedestrian
and motorist.

Logan named her “Wanda
Foureau’’ (wan duh fore oh), the
phonetical name for 1240, the
call number of WIST. He mail-
ed in this entry in mid-Septem-
ber along with the names “Char.

lotte Wister” and ‘Charlotte
Wistener.”’
Logan admitted that the

‘Common Girl Names” section
in Webster's had helped him in
creating this name as well as
an advertising jingle on WIST
itself.

Because he thought the station
management would want as
much advertising mileage as
possible, he concluded that a
name involving the station, its
call letters or call number
would have a greater chance. of
winning.

After calling WIST Sunday
afternoon to verify the announce-
ment, Logan telephoned the
good news to his father in Jack
son,, Ala. His reaction. ‘Well,
that’s really good, son. Have
you got any other news?" Thus
the elder Logan assumied the
tole of the traditionally cool
Davidson Gentleman and left his
son to exclaim, “God, I’m hap-

py!”

In a telephone conversation
Wednesday, WIST Program Di-
tector Ed Dean described Lo-
gan's winning entry as ‘most
imaginative’’ and “kind of un-
usual.’” He sald that among the
nearly 8,500 entries only four
were really very good. One
Tunner-up he cited was “Anita
Station.”

“I am very disappointed I did
not get to meet the girl I
named,"' lamented Logan this
week, but he does have $1,240
to console him. Most of the
money is already spent, how-
ever. He will apply it to second
semester expenses and he hopes
to have a small amount left

over.

Fraternities ToEvaluate
Relationship To College

By WALT DRAKE
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Davidson’s 12 social fra-
ternities will receive a ques-
tionnaire next week pre-

ared by the new Social
ife Evaluation Committee.

Each of the fraternities will
be requested to file a written
report, due on Nov. 22, express-
ing the attitude of their mem-
bership toward the place of their
fraternity in the life of the col-

and guests who are on campus
for the football game and who
whl eat lunch at the Union.

Since Slater's is experiencing
a severe shortage of help, the
college has pressed its mainten-
ance crew into overtime werk
to assist with these luncheons.

Faculty and administration
members have joined students
in criticizing cafeteria condi-
tions. Family members have
also been especially critical of
the snack bar.

One student said that on Sun-
day night. when he was at the
snack bar, French fries were
being served in cardboard boxes,
there was only one kind of soft
drink being served, the coffee
was not hot, and the selection
of pastries was very poor.

Two students reported seeing
a rat dart across the floor at

the sndck bar last Thursday
night. The girl who was work-
ing there said, “He probably
went into the dining room;
that’s where he usually goes.”
Another student complained
about bad meat served last
week: “There was only one
choice of meat, steak. My ‘steak’
had fallen off the bone, and the
meat tasted and smelled bad.
Several other students and 1

complained to Mr. Hill, who told’

us he thought the meat was all
tight, and didn’t even give a
hint of an apology.”

Three weeks ago. Hill prom-
ised the students that there
would be at least two new meat
dishes at every meal.

Other students have reported
that trays continue to collect in
the dining room when students
have finished eating. One sopho-

more complained in particular
that there have been trays in
the dining room at breakfast
which were left from the night
before on several ocasions re-
cently.

There have been numerous
complaints about the food and
the quality of food. One com-
plaint referred to the fact that
at several lunches this week
there has been only one type of
dessert, and that rolls, when
they are served, are never
heated. Another remark noted
that trays are often dirty, and
stuck together by food.

Several sophomores and. jun-
jors claim that the food and
service is much poorer than
it was last year. They particu-
larly complained about slow-
moving food lines.

One of them noted that there

In their answers the fraterni-
ties will be expected to present.
their attitudes toward the pres-
ent relationship between frater-
nity life and the academic life
and extracurricular activities of
the college.

They will also be asked their
attitudes toward national affilia-
tion, what specific benefits they
hope to offer new members,
what type of students they con-

are now only ;two cervers on
the lines, while last year there
were nearly always three. In
addition, many claim that the
student workers are especially
slow because they spend time
talking with students in the
lines.

Other upperclassmen com-
plained that, unlike last year.
no peanut butter or honey is
ever served, and there is very
rarely but one kind of salad
dressing.

Hill promised some _ sopho-
mores over three weeks ago that
his menus would be posted if a
bulletin board were put up, and
that he would have fresh fruit
on the serving lines as an alter-
native to desserts. Those sopho-
mores pointed out this week
that neither of these has been
done.

sider as most desirable for
membership in their group, what
system of election to fraterni-
ties they advocate, and their at-
titudes toward “‘black-ball” sys-
tems, selective bidding, and open
bidding.

The fraternities will also be
asked to include in their reports
their opinions of the new de-
layed rush system.

The answers’ to these ques-
tions can be written by a frater-
nity member, a committee of
members or the entire fra-
ternity. The only stipulation is
that it be approved by a major-
ity of the fraternity before be-
ing submitted to the Social Life
Evaluation Committee.

Professor Anthony Abbott, a
member of the committee, was
quick to emphasize that ‘‘these
are not loaded questions or ques-
tions that imply there is any-
thing wrong with fraternities.
This is in no sense a kind of ulti-
matum to the fraternities to
justify themsegves or perish.”

Rather, Abbo.: explained, the
committee hopes to assemble as
much relevant information as
possible about the fraternity sit-
uation on the Davidson campus.

Abbott commented that
through this questionnaire the
committee hopes to be able to
understand the official viewpoint
of the individual fraternities.

He noted that last year’s Fra-
ternity Evaluation Committee
was criticized many times for
being composed of so many anti-

fraternity men and having no

official fraternity statements.
The Social Life Evaluation

Committee was organized last
spring. Four students and five
faculty, and administration mem-
bers were appointed to the
committee by President D. Grier
Martin “to observe and evalu-
ate the results of the recom.
mended changes” in the frater-
nity situation at Davidson.

The committee is required to
report its findings and recom-
mendations to the faculty in Feb-
ruary. The findings will be con-
sidered when the faculty makes
its decision on whether or not
to keep the delayed rush system,
to adopt sophomore rush. or to
revert to the first-week-of-school
rush system in 1967.

Another project of the commit-
tee is already in progress. On
Sept. 28 the faculty received a
questionnaire from the commit-
tee asking for their observation
of student conduct in classes
during the first week or ten days
of the semester as compared
with the conduct in recent years.

Thirty-nine faculty members
indicated that they saw an im-
provement in class attitude and
work of the students in what
was in previous years the period
of fraternity rush. Eight profes-
sors indicated that they did not
see any improvement. Other re-
sults of this poll have not yet
been analyzed according to Dr.
W. G. Workman, who heads the
committee.

However, one student member
of the committee indicated that -
some of the faculty members
who were very anti-fraternity
