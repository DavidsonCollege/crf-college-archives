THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 18, 1924

Six Important Vacancies
In Student Organizations

T. B. Brown, Jr., business manager ot
the 1925 Quips and Cranks, is not return-
ing to school this fall and so this most

important office on the staff is left
vacant.
Brown was clected business manager

last spring when the class of '25 organized
their staff and only at the last monient
decided not to return. He will spend the
winter in making a trip around the world
instead of returning to graduate.

The position left open is one of the
most important on the staff and requires
a great deal of work. The class will find
some difficulty in finding another man
capable cnough or with the necessary
time to spend on it. However, a new man

will be appointed or clected immediately.’

L. L. Deck has been appointed busines.
manager of the Davidson College Mag-
azine to succeed John M. Selser, who
will not return this year. Other yacan-
cies are manager of the Glee Club, cap-
tain of the wrestling team, vice-president
of the Athletic Association and athletic
editor of the Davidsonian.

NEW HOTEL IS FORMALLY
OPENED
(Continued from page 1)

The establishment of a hotel fills a need
long felt both by the students of the college,
and by the citizens of the town. Heretofore
it has been difficult for visitors to find ac-
commodations while here, but it is thought
that. the hotel will relieve this condition,
and thereby help the progress of the town.
Mr. Cranford states that special attention
will be given to banquets, and that in the
spacious dining room they will be able te
care for all class, fraternity and other ban-
quets,

‘Prospects Bright for
Successful “Y” Year

Harry Price Makes Plans to Secure
Prominent Speakers for Vesper
Services

The Y. M. C. A. is looking forward to
a most successful year. Each member
of the cabinet is at work and with the
hearty co-operation of the student body
great good can be accomplished.

The speaker for the vesper service next
Sunday evening will be Dr. Albert Sidney
Johnson, pastor of the First Presbyte-
rian Church in Charlotte. Dr. Johnson
needs no introduction to the students of
Davidson as he has always proved a loyal
supporter of the college and has visited
the campus on many occasions. He was
given the honorary title of Doctor of
Divinity by the college in June, 1923. An
added feature to the vesper services this
year will be special music. A quartet
will
service Sunday night.

The president of the “Y,.” Harry Price,
has many plans he hopes to carry out in
connection with the work. As he stated
at the intsallation service last spring
“Davidson can bea place where men are
not satisfied with a form of Christianity,
but where men are willing to be radical-
ly Christian.”

As vice-president, R. W.-Oeland is in
charge of the personal work. This is a
great but one which cannot

ular department that some of the best
work is accomplished.

He has also arranged to have some spe-

yond the bounds of the campus, and

Summer Presents Many
Improvements on Campus

Landscaping and Other Improve-
ments Add Beauty to Grounds
n of Davidson College

Davidson has a campus she can justly
be proud of, a carpet of grass tinder a
canopy of shade trees. It is a combina-
tion that is hard to beat and gives the
campus the aspect of a woodland iawn.

And Davidson is proud of her campus,
which has few rivals in the South, and
each year efforts are made to improve it.
One of the most notable improvements
in the past year are the aristocratic pil-
lars at the corner of the campus and
the president’s home. These pillars are
the gift and lasting memorial of the ciass
of 24.

The stones of old Chambers have been
made once more useful and ornamenta!
and now constitute a wall along the side
of the campus fronting Main Street.
This wall enhances the beauty of the
campus to such an extent that one would
have to witness the change in order to
appreciate it. It gives the campus a fin-
ished appearance instead of the appear-
ance of gradually merging into the mud,
of the street. Now one can step from a
dry campus, down stone steps, onto the
clean pavement of the street; and the
mud may grit its proverbial teeth in vain.

And what of the mud on the campus,
for so many decades the bane of every |

WORK BY ENDEAVORERS

The first meeting of the Christian En-
deavor Training Class for the new
scholastic year was held in Shearer Hall
Sunday afternoon at 1:15. Approximate-
ly 30 students, including a dozen new
men attended the meeting. W. E. Mil-
ton, president of the class presided.

The president gaVe a short account of
the history and work of the class, wel-
coming the new men into the fellowship
of the old members. Following the open-
ing song service, led by L. L. Deck, and
the introductory remarks, the regular
planned program of the hour was begun.

The program consisted in reports by
old members in regard to Christian En-
during the summer, the
new-men-—also- telling in brief of their
connection «with C. E. before entering
Davidson. The reports revealed the fact
that the members had been active in the
work during the vacation months, or-
ganizing new societies and helping soci-
eties in the towns and cities from which
the students come. Much valuable ex-
perience was gained by practical work
during the summer, which will be
brought before the class during the year.

The program for next Sunday will con-
sist of a model deputation in which G.
M. Eddington and W. T. Covington will
be the speakers. All men interested in
C. E. work are cordially invited to join
the class.

Officers for the ensuing year are W.
|E. ,Milton, president; A. H. Hollings-
worth, Jr., Vice-president; J. M. Calhoun,
secretary; and W. T. Covington, treas-
urer,
