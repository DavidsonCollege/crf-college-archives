New director takes over Slater

By TIM WHALEN
Staff Writer
ARA Food Services announc-
ed Tuesday that they are trans-
ferring College food service
director Barry Cheatham.
ARA District Manager John
Packer said that Wes Good-
man, formerly an operations-
analyst with the ARA service at
R.J. Reynolds in Winston-Sa-
lem, has replaced Cheatham.
Cheatham has not yet been
reassigned, according to Pack-
er. The transfer was not definite
until Tuesday, but had been
under consideration at: least
since October, Packer added.
“We felt it (the change) was

better for all parties concern-
ed,” Packer said. He would not
comment further on the reason
for the transfer.

Cheatham said he would
withhold comment on the trans-
fer until he is reassigned.

Cheatham has been David-
son’s food service director for
two years. Business Manager
Bob Currie said, ‘‘I appreciate
very much the work Barry
Cheatham has done. He’s a
conscientious person with many
good qualities. We wish him
well in his career.”

Goodman has worked for
ARA for seven years. He said
he was at Gardner-Webb Col-

lege, Brevard College, and
UNC-Asheville before working
at R.J. Reynolds.

Goodman said his emphasis
in his work here will be on
service. ‘‘We’ve got to clean up,
upgrade the menus,” he said.
He would like to have a greater
variety of dishes and a better
assortment of fruits.

Goodman also plans to in-

crease student involvement in -

the food service. ‘‘I want the
students to talk to me. I like to
get out and talk to them and
find out what they want,’ he
said, adding, ‘‘I can’t solve all
the problems overnight, but I
can try.”

Ivey cites inadequacies in Slater food service

By ENNY O’BRIANT

The future of ARA Slater at

Davidson is still unclear.
_Davidson’s food service will

move into the new Dining

Commons in September.

Slater, the College’s food
service for over 20 years, will
submit a proposal next week for
the 1981-82 school year. The
College has not sought bids
from other food service compan-
ies, according to Business Man-

»,ager Bob Currie. Currie would
not say whether or not the
administration will ever accept
bids from other companies.

On December 2, the SGA
voted unanimously to support a
proposal that the administra-
tion should “actively seek bids
from other food/management
companies or attempt to estab-
lish its own in-house food
program.”

Freshman Senator Lentz
Ivey is concerned with the
quality of Davidson’s food serv-
ice. Ivey doubts that the Col-
lege could find a new food
service before September. “The
process of selecting and evalua-
ting food companies and their
services is a complex proce-
dure,’’ he said. ‘‘If the College
continues to postpone serious
consideration of other propos-
als, I do not feel that a food
service changeover for the 1981-

82 school year will be possible.”

Ivey, who has worked as an
ARA caterer in South Carolina,
feels that ARA Slater at David-
son is ‘‘definitely lacking in
consistency of quality’’ compar-
ed to other services. He also
questions whether Slater offers
a balanced diet to students on
either of the meal plans.

Ivey and other SGA members
are also interested in raising the
meal card allotment. Although
Snack Bar prices went: up this
year, the amount one can

purchase with a meal card at the
Snack Bar did not.

Ivey has met with Currie on
several occasions. He said he
has given Currie a list of

hman Senator Lentz Ivey.

approximately thirty-five
people or companies to contact
if the Colleg were to decide to
take bids from other food
services. Ivey also presented
Currie with information con-.
cerning national trends in food
service programs.

Ivey has proposed that the
administration reevaluate the

_ Davidson food program and

accept bids from other compan-
ies. ‘‘We may find that our food
service is adequate,’’ Ivey said.
“But then again we may dis-
cover that a better program is
possible.”

Students test vaccine,
become guinea pigs

By LISA DRAINE
Staff Correspondent

One hundred fifty Davidson
students will soon have the
opportunity to help test a
bacterial vaccine in a clinical
experiment.

Participants will be injected
with the vaccine after a prelim-
inary blood test. A second blood
test a moht later will complete

- the experiment. Each volunteer

will receive $30 for participat-
ing.
Dr. James Proke of Charlotte

Memorial Hospital is conduct-

ing the experiment with the
help of College physician Wil-
liam Williams. Injections will
be administered at the College
infirmary.

Parke chose Davidson as the
site of the experiment because
the student body is an acces-
sible group of healthy adults.
“As a group Davidson students
would be a lot more understand-
ing and would be able to see the
benefits (of such an experi-
ment),’’ Parke said.

The experiment will test var-

ious subtypes of the polyvalent
pneumococcal vaccine. Pneu-
mococcus is a bacteria which
causes several illnesses, includ-
ing pneumonia and meningitis.
Pneumonia is the fifth leading
killer in the United States.

The polyvalent pneumococcal
vaccine currently on the market
contains 14 types of polysacch-
aride, a multi-sugar compound.
T effectiveness of the group 9
polysaccharide is now in ques-
tion, according to Parke.

Parke said that five subtypes
of group 9 have been discover-
ed. He is “trying to find which
ist best subtype of group 9 to
put in the vaccine.”

The 150 participants will be
divided into six groups of 25,
each group receiving a different
group 9 subtype in their injec-
tion. Parke said he will then be
able to ‘‘compare which of the
pneumococcal subgroups gave
the best serum antibody re-
sponse.”

' Parke sahid he hopes ‘‘to gain
information that will allow re-

Faculty members express concern over computer finances

~ by DONALD CALDWELL

dation (NSF) to help pay for software,

mately $500,000. Again, as for imple-

student input.

All we have now is

News Editor

Several faculty members are uneasy
over College plans to buy a new
computer, a purchase that: the faculty
approved as a body last October.

Much of the concern centers on
financing the project.

“We're hearing that a purchase is
imminent. But there has been no
announcement of a majr grant to pay for
it,’ German Professor Hansford Epes
said. ,

Epes, who is chairman of the Profes-
sional Affairs Committeee, added that
he is concerned part of the cost for the
computer may come out of existing
funds rather than new money.

The College has applied for a $250,000
grant from the National Science Foun-

some hardware, and the cost of training
professors and students to use the new
facility.

This, however, will not cover the full
cost of implementation, which Computer
Services Director Robert DeSieno has
not yet estimated. ‘‘it’s very difficult to
give an accurate figure at this point,’’ De
Sieno said.

DeSieno noted that the present com-
puter facility in the basement of the
Chambers building will be too small for
the new hardward. Moving the computer
center will entail costs that cannot be
presently estimated, thereby adding to
the difficulty of setting a precise total
figure, he said.

“I anticipate that the costs of hard-
ware and software will run .approxi-

mentation costs it’s hard to say.

DeSieno hopes to receive a decision
from the NSF by April. He estimates
that Davidson hs a 20 to 25 percent
chance of receiving the funds.

Another faculty concern is access to
the College’s present computer. ‘There
has been a reduction in the availability of
the computer,’’ Economics Professor
Clark Ross said. ‘‘This stems perhaps
from a greater concern for security.”

Senior Mark Thomas complained that
stiudent access to the NCR Century 101
computer, used primarily by the admini-
stration, has been reduced in recent
months. He also said tht students had
not been consulted adequately in the
development of the expanded computer
program. ‘‘There needs to be more

indirect input through professors.”’

Thomas sees a great interest among
students in the computer field. “‘In past
years there has always been a group of
students interested in using the com-
puter. This year, though, the interest
surpassed the capabilities of the PDP-8

in terms of memory.” “I think many
students have grown frustrated with the
present computer's limits, but interest
should pick up again when the new
computer is in place next year,’’ he said.

The administration announced last
Friday the creation of an ad-hoc com-
mittee of the faculty to work with
DeSieno in planning the integration of
the computer into the curriculum.
