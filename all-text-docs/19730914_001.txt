College Approves Plans *

For 5 New Dormitories § ie

By TOM AINSWORTH
Contributing Editor

In order to relieve the
worsening housing situation on
the campus, Davidson College
has formulated and approved
plans for the construction of
five new living units to be ready
by the Fall of 1975.

Dean of Students, Will Terry,
who is also the chairman of the
Committee on Future Campus
Housing, confirmed the fact
that the units would be built on a
tract of land located to the
Northwest of Patterson Court, a
site previously chosen by the
committee.

Although only a _ rough
estimate of the total cost, 1.6 to
1.8 million dollars is the figure
which Terry considers
necessary to complete the new
housing.

“We have had three meetings
with the architect and he is now
in the process of determining
the cost to see whether or not we
can afford the housing,’’ said
Terry.

Since the buildings will
provide no revenue for the
college, ‘‘they will have to be
self-liquidating through fees,”
he said. ‘‘One of our problems
will be seeing what we can
justifiably charge the students

who will live there, while trying:

to k these buildings from
being for the rich. ”

In answer to the question of
where the money to fund the
project would come from, Terry
said that it was ‘‘my
understanding that the college
would have to borrow it from
someplace.”’

College Business Manager,
Robert A. Currie indicated that
“‘once an estimate is made, Dr.
Spencer and Mr. Cornell would
determine if campaign funds
could be used.”’

Currie also indicated that an
underwriter firm, J. Lee Peeler
of Durham, was helping the
college on the financial aspects
of the mie Project.

On the physical side of the
construction, Grover Meetze,
Director of the physical plant,
doesn’t foresee any problems.

“The only thing we'd have to
do would be to put in a new lift
station for the sewage down on
Patterson Court,’’ Meetze
indicated, ‘‘but we would have
had to put one in anyway as that
area down there develops.”’

As to the units themselves,
each would be able to hold
approximately 50

en, or about 250
students in all.

The architect selected for the
job is Paul Rudolph of New
York, whose architectural
accomplishments include
Wellesley College’s Fine Arts
Building, the Arts and
Architecture Building at Yale,
and office buildings across the
country.

His plans were selected by the
committee from over 23
applicants. When asked why he
decided to do the project,
Rudolph replied that he “‘liked
all sorts of building problems."’

The floor plan, according to
Rudolph, calls for‘‘a series of
apartments, actually a series of
living clusters, with
kitchenettes, designed for
casual living.’’

The plans are really
exciting,” commented Terry.
“They show some _ real
appreciation for what the
students themselves said they
wanted in a_ housing
questionnaire that went around
last year. The main reason we
chose Mr. Rudolph was the
interest and sensitivity he
displayed to what we wanted.

The inspiration for the design
of the buildings, according to
Terry, was the architecture of
Phi and Eu Halls on the
Davidsoncampus. .

When asked last Tuesday if he
had established any cost
estimate for the buildings,
Rudolph stated that ‘I haven't
established any fixed amount as
y' add

These new living units should
immensely ease the housing
shortage on campus with the

NEW SECURITY

Over the summer the College installed new lights in an attempt to
improve security precautions. Grover Meetz, Director of the
Physical Plant, painstakingly decided on the final style.

Davidson Halts‘Marine World’

By TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor

Visions of killer whales afloat
in mammoth salt water tanks
dominated the summer of ’73 in
North Mecklenburg County as
Davidson was asked to welcome
the multi-million dollar Marine
World.

Proposed by Traffic and
Planning Associates in Hickory
the site of the projected
amusement park was on the
peninsula of Lake Norman just
outside the Davidson town
limits west of I-77.

Marine World developers
unveiled plans for the facility
early in the summer, provoking
heated debate among residents
of Davidson, Mooresville and
Cornelius.

Even in the face of obvious
opposition from the Davidson

Citizen’s Association, the
enterprisers remained firm in
their plans to go ahead with the
Marine World.

The final obstruction came
last week when the Town of
Davidson refused to commit
itself to provide sewage
treatment for the park. Marine
World developers formally
withdrew their petition for re-
zoning of the 64-acre site on
Lake Norman on which they
held purchase options all
summer.

“If there are no petitions for
re-zoning of the property in
question. it will remain zoned
‘family residential’ ’’ explained
H. L. Mcintyre, Mecklenburg
County Zoning Administrator.

The enterprise would have
encompassed a far wider scope
than an ordinary amusement
park. A yacht club, rows of
boutiques and exclusive shops,
numerous restaurants on the
Davidson Landing along the
lake, and chapels and theatres
were also planned. Still another
phase of the project would have
been a convention center
composed of high-rise hotels
and an exhibit hall.

The central feature would
have been the sea creatures
and amphibians that were to
have been imported from all
over the world. At a town
meeting in July Ralph Quinlan
of Lincoln County, who runs a
Marine animal training center,
compared the project to those
located near St. Augustine,
Fla., and San Diego, Cal.

He claimed that Marine
World would have been the
most expensive and beautiful ot
those operating at the present
time.

The park would have
employed 50 adults year round
and about a hundred students
during the summer.

August the Marine World
developers negotiated with the
college for the rental of a
dormitory to house the working

students during the summer.

A Mecklenburg GAZETTE
poll of 85 readers revealed that
53 were against re-zoning while
32 were in favor of it. Among 183
members of the Davidson
Citizen’s Association, 158
indicated that they favored
denying the Marine World
planners the zoning changes
they sought.

Those favoring the Marine
World overtures, including
Congressman James G. Martin,
most often mentioned the
economic impact that Marine
World would have in Davidson.

Their adversaries argued on
several fronts. Seven special
problems related to Marine
World were the expected 80
percent increase in vehicular
and boat traffic, the need to
widen the access ramps to I-77,
and the real possibility of a
dangerous increase in the noise
level in Davidson proximate to
the World.

Fears that undesirable
businesses, such as bars and
hamburger stands would spring

up uncontrollably also figured
a in opposition to the
rk.

Development Earns

Davidson College has won a

The award consists of $1000,

award is s by the
United States Steel Foundation.

The giving to the college’s An-

Fund rose 41 t from a
total of $286,430 in 1970-71 to
$406,388 in 1971-72.

This trend continued last
fiscal year with an 8.8 percent
increase in annual gifts

boosting the amount to an all-
time high of $425,631.

This is particularly

significant since the $7.5 million
