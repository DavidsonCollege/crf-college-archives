with the ball. The squad will be cut. just
before Christmas in order that the best
players can be more thoroughly coached.
One of the nearby high schools will be
met next week in a practice game. Moores-
| ville will probably be played on the 16th of
|this month and the team will play Charlotte
| here either just before or a short time after
|the Christinas holidays. These games will
| be of great help in rounding the team into
| shape for the regular schedule.

| The first game on the regular schedule
| will be played on February Ist, when Wake
| Forest comes here to encounter the Wild-

|kittens. Duke will be played here a few
days later. The state trip will include five
games. Oak Ridge, N. C. State, Wake

| Forest, Duke, and Carolina, will be played.
| Most of these teams will come here for
; games during the latter part of February.
;This is a comparatively stiff schedule and
| will show exactly how Davidson stacks up
| with other state teams. The schedule, as
|announced by Manager Christenbury, is as
| follows:
| February 1—Wake Forest at Davidson.
February 4—Duke at Davidson.
February 10—Oak Ridge at Oak Ridge.
February 11—Wake Forest at Wake For-
est.
February 12—State at Raleigh.
February 13—Duke at Durham.
February 15—Carolina at Chapel Hill.
February 18—Oak Ridge at Davidson.
February 19—N, C. State at Davidson.

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

One of the sport writers in the state |
selected Coach Monk, Younger and Bob,

| Fetzer to coach the all-state team that)

was picked. That sounded good to us,
and we are glad that this recognition is |
made of the genius of Monk Younger.

A revised pick by one of the state pa-|
pers is not in accordance with our idea |
of an all-state team, but they do have |
a paragraph at the end which is a tribute |
tothe all-round ability of Monk Younger. |
We quote as follows: |
|

Which brings to mind Mr. Grange’s re- |
cent transaction of $300,000, Wonder who
is blaming him now for entering pro-
fessional football? It seems as if he is
using it only to amass a fortune. At the
tate of $82,000 in eleven days of profes-
sional football it would seem to us that
Mr. Grange is about ready to retire from
the game.

Suppose he should break his leg or arm
in one ofthe games. That would be more
than mere tough luck, in our estimation.

“Lives of gridders all remind us
We can print our name in blood
And departing leave behind us
Half our faces in the mud.”

changed to “We can print our name in
money.” That thought is generated by

from an ice
possessor.

carrier to a small fortune

There are several batches of fel-

the outside contests are nil. It means
that they all will be ready for the battles

Don’t forget the battle of books about
that time, too.

It is said that Fresh McCullum and
Westbrook are having a contest to see
which one can excel the other in the
standing broad grin.. Watch them care-
fully and see which one is leading the
next time you meet either onthe campus.

Davidson is proud of Pat Crawford and
his state champions. Pat never made his
letter in varsity football, but for four
long years he trudged out every after-
noon, never to have his ambition realized
in that sport.

As they have said before, though, some
of the greatest coaches never played
football in their lives. Zuppke is the
greatest demonstration of this. Laval,
coach of Furman, never knew what it
was to be in a varsity game. It shows
that they get the fundamentals and have
the ability to give that knowledge to
others.

The best high school team in the state
and one of the best college teams in the
state are to be guests on that occasion.

Every year Gastonia comes to the fore-
front and cements the close bond of feel-
ing existing between Davidson and the
alumni association there by giving the
Wildcat letter men a banquet., And they
don’t fail to feed, they tell us. We'll tell
you more about it next week—if we are
able after it is all over.

High School Champions

Gastonia High Wins State Title |
After Being Coached by
Wildcat Players

On last Wednesday, December 2, Coach |

Pat Crawford, of the Gastonia High School, |
invited the coaches and certain members of |
the varsity squad of Davidson, to come over |
and help them prepare for their coming bat- |
tle with Sanford for the state championship.
Those going over were Coaches Younger
and Tilson, “Brassy” Baker, Lucian Wells, |
and Joe McConnell. Tilson, Baker, and Mc-
Connell spent the afternoon helping Craw-
ford with his line, while Younger and Wells
worked with the backfield. They all eyipyed
their workout with the Gaston boys very |
much, and were glad to help Pat Crawford. |

The battle for the state championship was
fought Saturday at Chapel Hill. The Gas-
tonia team, rapresentatives of the west, went
into the fray in perfect condition. The
Sanford boys were outweighed by Craw-
ford’s chargers, but they expected to make
up for this in fight. The game was a thriller
from start to finish, but it could readily be
seen that Gastonia had the advantage. The
winners earned a clean victory, and made
eight first downs to none for their opponents.
Early in the second quarter Schneider tackled
Gregson behind his goal for a safety. Gas-

tonia’s touchdown was not made until the last
quarter, when Frederick drove through the
Sanford line for the marker. Henderson,
for Gastonia, and Frazier, for Sanford, were
the stars of the game.

This is the first time that Gastonia has
ever won the football championship of North
Carolina. Pat Crawford, coach of the team,
is an old Davidson man who graduated with
the class of '24. Crawford was quite a star
while at Davidson, making his letter in base-
ball and basketball.

It is suggested that Charlotte do some-
thing in this line occasionally. Something
of this nature would draw Charlotte and
Davidson closer together, and would in-
dicate that Charlotte is back of Davidson
to the limit.
