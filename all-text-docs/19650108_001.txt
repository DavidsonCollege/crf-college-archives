Former Professor
Dies In Charlotte

The Rev. Charles Malone
Richards, long time Davidson
professor, died Christmas in a
Charlotte hospital.

Dr. Richards was born in
Léberty Hill, S. C., in 1871, the
son of the Rev. and Mrs. J. G.
Richards.

Dr. Richards was graduated
from Davidson in 1892 and from
Columbia Theological Seminary
in 1895. The next year he was
ordained as a Presbyterian
minister, and he served as an
active pastor until 1926. His
pastorates included a country
circuit in South Carolina and
the First Presbyterian Church
in Statesville.

He became a part time pro-
fessor at Davidson in 1917
while serving as pastor of the
Davidson College Presbyterian
Church. In 1926 he became a
full time professor of Bible.
After his retirement in 1944, he
served for 15 years as a supply
preacher to many churches
without ministers.

Dr. Richards was awarded a
Doctarate of Divinity by David-
son College and a Doctor of
Laws degree by Hampden-Syd-
ney College. He was a member
of Kappa Alpha Order, ODK,
and Phi Beta Kappa, and was
included in Who's Who in
America.

Funeral services were con-
ducted on Monday, Dec. 28 at
the Davidson College Presby-
terian Ohurch. Burial followed

Historical Implications of the
Elections of 1964.”

As part of the YMCA's Great
Issues Program, Link will ex-
amine the election in light of
problems such as the growth
of liberalism since F. D. Roose-

velt and the future of the Re-

publican Party.

After graduating from the
University of North Carolina in
1941 and obtaining his PhD
there in 1945, he taught at North
Carolina State College for a year
and at Northwestern University
for 11 years. In 1958-59 he was

DRAWS COLD RESPONSE

Gasper Analyzes Latins

Dr. Edmund Gasper swept through the bavidson campus last Tuesday in some-
thing less than a blaze of glory. His reception was somewhat reminiscent, in fact,
Dugan last month, who commented, “This is the dead-

of that given to poet Allen
est place I've been.”

Gasper spent a day at David-
son, speaking in chapel. talking
with faculty, and participating
in a forum-style discussion with
the father of Project for the
Americas (PRAM), Fred Ehlers.
A look at Gasper’s record im-
mediately establishes his posi-
tion of authority on. Latin Ameri-

Unfortunately for the David-

no degrees in public speaking.

accent. Gasper accumulated a

speaking in a dull monotone

Gasper's reception Tuesday
evening was. if possible, even
more unenthusiastic. Fred Eh-
lers commented. however, that
the two-way discussion was
“very interesting.’’ He admitted
that Gasper was no speaker, but
stated, ‘“‘In my opinion, he’s a
tremendous expert. He said
things the students have to rea-
lize.” Ehlers also felt that the
student body hadn't given Gasp

to sleep.

“They go to hear a bad speak-

talk. Gasper suggested to him}
that the US needs less material-}

and a greater ‘cultural exchange.
“A kind of cultural Peace Corps”
was the way he expressed it.

Council Members Vow
Stricter Enforcement

By FRANK FLEMING
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Davidson students in Thursday's referendum adopt-
ed the newly-proposed drinking rule change by a vote
of 360 to 15. The referendum provides for the adoption
of the following amendment to be added to the end of
Article VIII, Section 2 of the Student Body Constitution:

“For the purpose of enforc-
ing this regulation with specific

|| regard to the possession of al-

coholic liquors, the trunks of
autmobiles shall not be cover-
ed by the term ‘campus.’”’

The amendment, having been
proposed by the Student Coun-
cil on Dec. 15 and read aloud
to the student body on Dec. 17,
will. go into effect as of Friday,
Jan. 8.

Will Terry Outlines His View
Of ‘Modern Christian College’

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

College Chaplain Will
Terry forsook his familiar
quips Wednesday night as
he talked seriously with stu-
dents and faculty about the
definition and purpose of
the modern Christian col-
lege. He spoke in the
Union’s Open End, first out-
lining the experts’ opinions
of a Chrisitan college, then
giving a profile on the
American student.

A Christian college, he said,
is an institution “grounded in
the realization of the personal,
creating, loving God of Abra-
ham, Isaac, and Jacob," and
“terminating in Jesus."' It sees
man as a being of “freedom,
responsibility, and love."

The college incorporates
Truth, the mutual ideal of both
the Classical and the Chris-
tian traditions, into its purpose.
It does not, added Terry, give
“mere information’ nor a ‘goal
of intellect," but gives the
student “confidence in his des-
tiny.”

To attempt to define the
Christian college specifically,
Terry first said what is it not,
and then what it is. A college
is not Christian merely “be
cause of its publicity, because
it has required chapel, because
it is connected with a Christian

church organization or because
its faculty is Christian.”’ It
not permissive or ‘“‘wishy-
washy"’ or judgmental. It does
not have the same function of
the church.

Rather, it teaches an integrat-
ing faith in Christian ideals,
confessing Christ's ‘supreme
value in history.’ The aim and
spirit of Christ are incorpor-
ated in its policy. It is a‘school
of higher learning forming a
Christian academic community,
with its goal being the search
for Truth, the knowledge of
God in the universe."

The member of such a com
munity is, ina sense, an evan-
gelist, continued Terry. It is
the school's duty to educate, in
order that it might produce not
only ministers, but also church-
men, who will actually “chal-
lenge the church from the
pew,"’ to invigorate the faith

Terry then described the re
lationship between students and
faculty on the Christian cam-
pus by what he called “com-
radery.'’ He. said that the two
should work together in the
Christian gpirit, sharing “as
colleagues, not as antagonists.”

“The faculty,’’ he said, “are
the key to the Christian col-
lege; they hold the most in
fluence over the students.”’ They
must be “proficient in their

is

field, have a Christian commit-

ment, and a feeling of respon-

sibility for their students.’ Lo-

calizing, Terry said he would

encourage attendance at chapel
and vespers for the faculty as
well as the students—an act of

communion.

Regarding required attend-
ance by students at chapel and
vespers. Terry recognized points
for and against, but ended by
saying that the services central-
ize worship, establish rapport
between students and faculty,
and, what is more, are a part
of the total curriculum of the
college.

Moving into his outline of the
American student, Terry brught
up the role of fraternities in
the Christian campus. He re-
marked that if the ideals of
brotherhood and féllowship
were upheld, the fraternities
would be an integral part of
the Christian college.

If the fraternity
“uplift rather than tear down,”
its role on campus would en
rich the student body and the
but if it founded
on prejudice, racial or other-
wise, it cannot be a part of a
Christian college.

sity of Pennsylvania professor
Philip Jacobs, Terry profiled

that the modern student comes

from a generally common mold,
and college does little to change
this mold.

He is characterized by “self-
centeredness, disinterest in so
cial problems, and a need to
believe in something." How-
ever, this need to believe is
too often satisfied by deism, and
not by a definite faith, which
the Christian college tries to
teach.

Few students today, said Ter-
ry, “are able to integrate reli-
gion and life."' Their early relig-
ious training is a remote mem-
ory, probably sweet but not of
any great consequence in their
lives.

The student's moral code is
usually guided by convention,
or what his actions will do to
his image. His basic patterns
have already been established,
and college usually does not
alter them

In a brief question period,
when asked whether the Chris-
tian college could compete with

the non-Christian Terry  re-
plied: “In the South, David
son is now competing very
well, although in the future,

it is evident that the state uni-
versities will make the largest |
advances. The same is true in

the North where such schools |
as Haverford and Swarthmore |

are leaders academically among
schools of their same size."

fied the meaning of the amend-
ment by explaining that the
phrase “ trunks of automobiles”
will include “only the trunks
of standard passenger cars.
Therefore, for the purposes of
enforcement of this regulation
the Honor Court does not con-
sider such automobiles as sta-
tion wagons to have legitimate

Bates commented, “Anyone
with some question about this
regulation and its application to
him or to his car should check
with the Honor Court or Coun-
efi,”

President Will Jacksn ex-
plained that the rule legalizes
only the possession of alcohol
trunks. However, “actual
drinking in a trunk would still
be illegal."

EARLIER PROPOSAL
The entire question involving
the drinking rule goes back to
October when several concern-
ed students recognized the
problem of increased drinking
on campus. An earlier proposal

to correct this was rejected in
a Dec. 17 referendum because
of its ambiguity, absurd loop-
holes, and interpretative weak-
nesses.

in

However, further co-opera-
tion between the faculty and
Council led to a plan which
legalizes the trunk as a place to
store alcoholic beverages. Their
intended purpose is that such
a rule should discourage the
possession of alcohol in the
dormitories or fraternity
houses. As a result, it should
curtail actual drinking on
campus.

POLICY STATEMENT

Accompanying the amend-
ment is a new declaration of
policy in which the Council and
the Honor Court are pledged to
“support and enforce”. the new
regulation, even to the extent
of “searching dormitory rooms
or fraternity houses.”

The Council asks the co-ope-
| ration of the student body in
| complying with the rule. “Since
an alternate storage place for
liquors has been provided,
there should be no excuse for
keeping alcohol anywhere else.”
Thus, the Council and Honor
hope to minimize any
