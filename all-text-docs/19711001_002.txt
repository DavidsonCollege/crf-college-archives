Better Computer
System Possible

By DAVID ARANT
Staff Writer

Officials in the Davidson com.
puter center indicate that the
college is now considering ex-
pansion of their facilities along
the lines of a terminal system.

Jerry A. Roberts. chairman
of the computer center, reports
that the college is now looking
into the possibility of having a
terminal system on campus
which would link the computer
to various classrooms on cam-
pus.

The National Cash Register
Company demonstrated a term-
inal system September 14 in
Chambers Building which re-
portedly impressed major col-
lege officials.

Citing the advantage of the
terminal system, Roberts ex-
plained computer outlets loca-
ted throughout the school would
make the computer system
more accessible. By placing the
terminal in the chemistry or
physics laboratory, the student
could have immediate use of
the computer's services in mak-
ing calculations.

Roberts says another advan-
tage of the terminal system is

that it could be hooked up '
a computer center such as the
Research Triangle in Wake
County which would provide ac:
cess_to a large number of prv-
grams in this computer center.
“The time will come when «+
will have terminals,” Rober s
said.

Until that time, the college
will continue use of the Cer:
tury Computer in the basemer’
of Chambers Building which 's
available for the use of the
students and faculty afternoons
and evenings each weekday.

Kenneth R. Carmack, head 0!
the Data Processing Services.
Says that assistance in opera-
tion is available in both the
afternoon and evening.

When asked about the types
of problems the computer han
dies, Roberts said, ‘‘Our only
limit is in our ability to analyze
the problem, so that the ma-
chine can follow it.” To show
the variety of systems the com-
puter can handle, Roberts said
he is now programing the
computer to respond with the
time of .sunrise and sunset of
any day of the year when the
latitude and longitude of the
location is fed in.
