sociation, Writes Letter

QUESTIONS ASKED

Alumni Secretary Will Compile
Data and Report to President,
Who is Member of Nomi-
nating Committee

The office of the Alumni Secretary
is now being flooded with letters from
Davidson alumni all over the country,
who are writing in response to a letter
mailed out Monday to the entire alum-
ni constituency by Dr. Hamilton W.
McKay, ‘06, president of the Davidson
College Alumni Association, who wrote
the Davidson men in regard to the
next president of the college.

Dr. McKay told them that he had
been appointed the nominating
committee by virtue of the fact that
he was president of the Alumni Asso-
ciation, and that he was addressing a
letter to them with the idea of obtain-
ing ‘a cross-section of alumni opinion,
which would enable him to crystallize
his own, as well as be of benefit to the
committee.

direct questions asked.
“What type Of man do you want as
next President of Davidson? Do
you want a minister? Do you want
‘an executive and business man? Do
you want primarily an educator?” He
urged them not to adopt the policy of
“letting George do it” and then criti-
cise the action of the committee and
board of trustees afterward. 2

Toward the close of his communi-
cation Dr, McKay asked the alumni to
name the men they would like to see
nominated, and ‘stated that both their
opinions and suggestions were to be
treated confidentially.

All of this information is being sent
to the Alumni Secretary, who is filing
the letters, and will later compile and
tabulate the information received.

Emery Flinn, ’19, Receive
Noteworthy Recognition

Fidelity Union Trust Company
of Newark, N. J., and Flinn
With Miami Bank

Two comparatively recent — alumni,
Leopold Chambliss, ‘18, of Newark, N.
J., and Emery Flinn, ‘19, of Miami, Fla.,
have been signally honored by financial

lications carried photographs of the two
Davidson men.

retary and treasurer of the Fidelity Union
Trust Co., of Newark, N. J., has been
promoted to the position of assistant vice-
president in charge of new busines and

at a recent meeting, added two new offi-
cers, and one of them was Mr. Flinn,
who was elected vice-president to be ‘in
charge of the securities and bond depart-
ment.

Chambliss was one of the originators of
the personal solicitation for trust  busi-
ness. He organized the original trust
new business unit for the Guaranty Trust

tion.

Mr. Flinn has likewise had a varied
experience since leaving Davidson as a
graduate in 1919. He was also in the
United States ‘Army, in the artillery de-
partment, returning to the college after

his discharge to complete his work. Fol-
