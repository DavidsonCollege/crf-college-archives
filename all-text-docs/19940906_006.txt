Fo those of you who do not Ike Bailey rectly because of past and present Gull’s Nest:
know, affirmative action is the term discrimination; it does not solve Bill Gullan .

used to describe the process of
recruiting minority students and
workers, or. the actual
preferencegiven to a minority in
certain situations. It can mean
anything from “lowering stan-
dards” to admit or hire a minority,
to simply making minorities more
aware of opportunities around
them.

Affirmative action:

against, and because of that dis-

minorities who attend schools like

problem.

Yet, affirmative action is im-
portant. It does not directly solve
any problem, but it has probably
sped up the process of solving it. It
has done this by making it a little
easier for those highly motivated
minorities; in other words, it has
evened out the race a bit. It allows

neither stops the bleeding.
Affirmative action was éstab-
lished not only because of present
discrimination, but for past dis-
crimination as well. It recognizes
the fact that for a long time minori-

this discrimination has taken away
lots of economic opportunities,
which have translated into a major
disadvantage in educational and
employment opportunities. It rec-

we all run the same race, that some

Yet, it does not come close to

Will someone please tell me
what to do?

A: seven years old, I had my
career path all planned out. I would
work hard in elementary school
and when] got old enough to grow
a gruffy beard I would take the big
test and become the best darned
bus driver Shorecrest Preparatory
School had ever seen. And on
‘ Tuesday I'd fly saucers to Neptune
and dig for pterodactyl bones in
Peru.

Today,. when career choices
dictate the classes I enroll in and
how much money I can expect, to
make, I have come to a rather dis-
turbing discovery: I wish I were
seven years old again.

I’m at that age where people
expect me to know exactly what
I'll be doing after I end my many
years of higher education. And
they always ask me these mind-
boggling questions which usually
lead to stimulating conversation:

OLD MAN: (Smiling wist-
fully) Son, what are you going to
do when you grow up?

ME: (Rolling my eyes) Well,
I’mnot really ina position to make
a definite decision right now. I’d
like to keep my options open. Who
knows, I might become a nuclear
physicist and win the Nobel Prize
in Cadmium.

OLD MAN: You don’t have
the foggiest idea, do you?

ME: No sir.

OLD MAN: Get out of my
sight, you retard.

Choosing -a career requires
hours of meditation. The wrong
occupation can leave you trapped
in a desk job wishing you could

-. staplegun the Xerox sign to the
boss’s forehead.

A recent USA Today survey
stated that 56% of American pro-
fessionals wished they couldswitch
jobs with Moe, the wiry 9th Street
sweeper. To put it simply, choos-
ing the-wrong career can lead to

unhappiness, alow sense of fulfill-
ment, a high level of stress, and
rickets.

This pressure drives me crazy.
So, how do you choose the right
career? A person, who will remain
nameless simply because I’ ve for-
gotten his name, once told me to
make a list of jobs that I would
definitely not like to pursue.

Okay, I would not like to
teach middle school because pre-
pubescent kids annoy me. Well, I
certainly feel better. Of course the
best way to get back at those punk
little rug rats is to make their class-
room experience absolutely mis-
erable. And you know what - that
explains a lot.

Another career planning op-

tion is to take the Myers-Briggs
Personality Test. . I took the test
and scored well above my usual
Davidson marks. I’m an Intro-
verted Sensing Thinking Perceiv-
ing person which means that I’m
quiet, reserved, observant, and des-
tined for a career in animal hus-
bandry.
5 Actually, an accompanying
guidebook showed the careers suit-
able for the various. personality
types but unfortunately I can’t re-
member any of my career possi-
bilities because I was more con-
cerned ‘about the typical college
life of an ISTP: “Dates once a
month or does not even try at all.
Likes frogs.”

The best advice for career
hunters is for them to trek on down
to the Careers Office right across
from the Student Health Center. In
this well furnished, white, south-
ern plantation-style building,
they’ve got.job guides, alumni
guidebooks, graduate school list-
ings, a battery of tests, and friendly,
helpful people who can help you
doalmosteverything. Except make
you seven again,

Davidson, Harvard, and Howard.
In other words, it helps those who
are taking those same difficult steps
that any hard-working, white
American is taking. It helps those
qualified, highly intelligent people
who would have eventually found
a way to make it through anyway.

But in most cases, it does not
help those who need it the most:
the poverty stricken, illiterate, and
almost helpless—those people that
are in such poor conditions di-

to help those that
need help the most. It does not
make completing a rigorous aca-
demic workload easier. It does not
make the pressures of doing a job
any less difficult. What it does is
give-one an opportunity that might
not have been there without this
action.

‘So, excuse me if I don’t sheda
tear for those of you crying reverse
racism. If you really felt the ef-
fects of racism, then maybe you
would have something tocry about.

Overdose of O.J.

So here I am back at school, get-
ting psyched up for a brand new
school year, entering the Commons

line for my very first breakfast at |

Davidson College. Mmm, mmm,
good. I’mtryingto putall thoughts
of the wonderful summer behind
me, and actually, I’ mdoing a pretty
good job of it. That is, until I spy
the new addition to the food array:
little containers of O.J.

Oh my God, I scream as my
tray crashes to the floor. Not those
two letters! Please not this! You
can burn out my eyes with red-hot
pokers but please not those ini-
tials!

Is it just me or is everybody
really sick of all this O.J. Simpson

crud? It seems like all summer my —

ears were bombarded with this clue,
that piece of evidence, and yet an-
other show-stopping DNA test. I’m
seriously ready to puke. And what
brought this onslaught of tripe, you
say? The mass media is surely a
prime culprit, always armed and
ready with the latest update.

But is it really all their fault?
Maybe not. Maybe the media is
just an accomplice, the hit man for
a far deadlier foe. Yet what hor-
rible monster could be so corrupt?
How about us, American society?
What if we’re the guilty party in
the O.J. fiasco? .

I mean, it’s great that an ex-
sports hero is being tried for two

A; B,C.

On yeah, it's great to be back.
You've just gotta love excessive
humidity and excessive homework.
I love sweating before, during, and
after a shower. I love my rights as
a smoker being gradually stripped
away. I love trying to return things
at the bookstore without a receipt.
I could go on forever, but my
little hassles mean nothing. Youse
(aclassic Phillyism) need the scoop
on Davidson and life in general,.
and I've decided to give it to you in
an A-to-Z format:
A is for alky
which you'll all become

‘if you put down your books and

break out the rum.

B is for Baker,

so clean and so huge,

but what they should do is build us
a luge.

C is for Commons,

you feel like a horse

because you're back in a stall
before the main course.

D is for the Dean,

he's outgoing and cute,

but this new alcohol policy should
go down the chute.

E is for the Eagles,

they're out of control,

and they'll be the winners of this
year's Super Bowl.

F is for flunk-

though we hope for the best,

we'll probably be failing our very
first test. ae

G is for "Good Stuff"

the freshmen all get,

: but there ain't enough Pert Plus to

even get wet.

H is for Howdie,

my roommate and bud;

I won't get much sleep ‘cause the
guy is a stud.

1 is for interesting,

which my classes are;

I'll try to do well but won't get very
far.

J is for jealous,

‘which is how I now feel,

because freshmen find girls that I
_ like and they steal.

K is for klutz,

like me when I walk;

I waddle and tumble if I just try to
talk.

L is for Little,

we're having a ball

‘cause I'm the best hall counselor
and second's the hall.

M is for Mondays,

they put an end to the fun;

parties are memories and
homework's not done.

N is for Nazi,

I regret that they're here;

just watch their response to smok-
ing and beer.

O is for Observer,

it comes in the morn;

at least journalistically it's a step

"above porn.

P is for Pika,

the best on the court,

where we have a great time and
drinking's our sport.

Q is for Quagmire,

who lives right above;

ask him about his new hall and new
love.
