THE DAVIDSONIAN

A Look At Basketball

A new star has risen in the not too clouded constellation at
Davidson. While a small, but enthusiastic, contingent backed

the Cat hoopsters, Joe Milner, tall agile freshman from Atlanta, |

played his role like a veteran and pushed in 22 points Tuesday
night. By the end of the half, his performance had marked!

Those on the team are tired of being one of the few aggrega-
tions with a losing record.

Then Swimming

In what was probably one of the most thrilling sporting
events of the year, Eastern Carolina nudged the “Cat fish” in
the last event here Saturday. With several of the athletes on
the sick list and for the first meet, their performance was out-
standing.

Although the squad misses three event star Al Ormond,
who graduated last year, several new men are coming along
well. Curt Ormond seems to have his cousin's touch in the back-
stroke and will help. Rivers and Spears will dominate the}
sprints, while John Edwards ought to be back to his record
breaking form soon.

In the meets that are forthcoming, none are runaways in
either direction. If there is any one big weakness on the|
squad, it is the lack of depth. But it can be overcome as the
season progresses.

And Wrestling

Busiest outfit of all over the weekend was the wrestlers
who met three of the South’s best here in Johnston gym. Al-
though they lost all three, there were some fine matches in
each division. With these, the toughest, matches behind them,
the grapplers expect to get on the winning track against UNC |
this weekend. |

Snider, Griffin, Wright, and Westervelt all had fine mo-
ments during the meet and the prospects are bright for the
rest of the matches.

An Indictment And Challenge

All fall those of us who have professed to be sports en- |
thusiasts went to all manner of trouble to attend the football |
contests. Even the freshman were made to sit together and
cheer as a body. However, as winter comes on and the ath-
letic activities move inside, it has become too easy for us to
remain in our rooms and stay away from the indoor sports en
masse.

Granted that due to the number and nature of the ac-
tivities, the attendance is naturally going to be smaller. But}
it shouldn’t be pathetic, as it has been recently. Here is an
opportunity for us to enjoy some outstanding sporting events
and back the participants who deserve the same support given
football. What are we going to do with it?

SALUTE TO DANNY MILLER

By JOHN JOHNSTON

thall coach at Davidson for the

past three years, resigned his post December | and ended
an outstanding basketball career

completed his schooling nine years
later, receiving his masters degree
University of
North Carolina,

After his release from the Navy
in 1945, he accepted a position in
the personnel department of a
Winston-Salem hosiery mill and
played semi-pro basketball there.
In June of 1946 Danny took over
the reigns of Wingate Junior Col-
lege's team, where he gained his
reputation as a standout coach, His
teams compiled an amazing record
of 169 wins against 39 Josses during
the six years at his first coaching
job

In Davidson's opening game this
season, it was two of Coach Mil-
ler’s proteges; Hobby Cobb for the
“at's and Darrell Floyd for Furman,
that were the high -forers. At Win-
gate Danny introduced Floyd to
college basketball and developed
the abilities of the nation's leading
scorer of last year.

Danny came to Davidson in 1951
and started a team building pro-
gram that produced better teams
and better records every year. Un-
doubtedly, with the help of the
new material, this would have been
his best season.

gret that the school learned of
Coach Miller's acceptance of a job
as sales representative of National
Container Corporation, for he is
recognized not only as a good coach
but also as a person who has done
much for the cause of basketball in
this area. His most recent project
has been the promotion of the Car-
rousel Tournament in Charlotte
this month. As assistant director he
was in charge of securing teams to
play in the tournament.

Before leaving “Coach” wanted
to say, “I appreciate all the kind-
ness and courtesy extended to me
by the students, faculty, and admin-
istration in my career at Davidson.
I wish to thank each one for all
the assistance they've given me.”

Good luck to you in the future,
Danny Miller.

Cats take on Guilford here on December 15.

In Charleston, % C. this week,
the team engages the College
of Charleston tonight and the Cita-
del tomorrow night. After three
games under their belts, this “big-
ger and better’ squad should be
ready to give an exhibition of its
power

Like a powerful fleet automobile
with carburetor trouble, the Wild-
cats in their first three outings,
while sputtering and stalling at
times, have given definite indica-
tions of being a truly outstanding
unit as soon as the fuel mixture is
adjusted.

In the first game of collegiate
ball ever played in the awesome
Charlotte Coliseum, December 1,
Furman took advantage of the first
half lethargy to take such a com-
manding lead that the improved
second half Cat play was of no
avail. Led by Fred Fraley, the real
star of Thursday's encounter, and
All-American Darrel Floyd, who
jtossed in 33 points, the Purple
Paladin literally ran off with the
game. Hobby Cobb led the DC
charge with 18 points. Final: 86-66.

In Knoxville Saturday night, Dan-
ny’s boys ran into SEC power, Ten-
nessee, and come out on the short

end, 77-64. However, according to |
all reports, the Cats, after another |
slow half, bore down in the second

canto to narrow the UT lead from
its commanding 25 to 9 at one point.
Cobb, hitting for 18 again, did a
fine job of cleaning the backboards
in the battle with All-SEC star,
Carl Widseth. Harding chipped in
with 19 to bolster the cause.

On Tuesday night here at David-
son the initial entry on the win-
ning side was written in a wild
and woolly 96-90 victory over Ca-
tawba. Led by Hobby Cobb’s 29
points and 27 rebounds, Joe Mil-
ner’s emergence as a college player
with 22 tallies, and the ever steady
Ray Harding and his 22, the Cats
staved off a late game rally to pull
the game out.

Catawba was sparked by a dead-
ly shot in its frosh star, Donnie
Hunt, who got 26. Perhaps the
most interesting aspect for the lo-
cals, outside of the play of Milner,
was the first appearance of Dave
Hollinsworth into action, In an ex-
citing display he combined tip-
ends, push shots, rebounds, sleight-
of-hand, and defense into a picture
that predicted bright things from
him also. Not to be overlooked is
the performance of yet another
freshman, Semi Mintz, who leaves
little to be desired.

After being stunned by East
Carolina in their first meet, the
Wildcats bounced back Saturday
afternoon against The Citadel at
Charleston. Since this is the Bull-
dogs’ first meet, nothing is known
about them, except to expect a
very close -match. In the meet with
them last year Davidson won in the
final event, the 400-yard relay.

“It is very difficult for a team
