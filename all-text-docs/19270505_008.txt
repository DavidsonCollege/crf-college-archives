THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 5, 1927

“Y” Plans Mother’s .
Day Vesper Service

A special Mother’s Day service has
been planned for ”Y” Vespers, Sunday
night, May 8th. This program will be
the third service of the year conducted
by the students, the Christmas program
and one of the first services of the year
being conducted by them. Bill Christian,
the retiring president will be in charge
and the principal ¢gpeaker of the hour will
be Harllee Branch. It suffices to say
that with these men leading the meeting
will be well worth while.

Special music is being planned by the
quartet and it is possible that others will
aid them. That it will be held in the open
air, weatHer permitting, will be another
attraction of the meeting. Chairs will be
provided at the rear of the “Y” Hall to
accommodate the students and towns
people. wa ¢

This is the second open meeting
held this year. The first was Easter song
service held during the holidays. This
meeting was nicely attended in spite of
the fact that many of the students were
off the campus. As the weather grows
warmer our religious fervor is inclined
to become cooled but, fellows, there are
just two or three more“ meetings to be
held this year and let’s come out and
make them the best ever. Especially
let’s come to this meeting in remem-
brance of those mothers whom we have

her condition was not thought to be
serious, her death came as a shock to her
many friends and acquaintances. The
funeral services were held Monday morn-
ing, May 2nd,

The funeral services were conducted by
Dr. James Taylor, of Washington, D. C.,
pastor of the Central Presbyterian
Church, who was Mrs. Brown’s pastor
for many years. He was assisted by
Rev, Edgar Woods, pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church, of Salisbury, who
was Mr. Brown’s pastor before he came
to Davidson. The service was held at
the home and the interment following at
the Davidson cemetery. All college ac-
tivities were suspended at eleven o'clock,
the hour of the funeral,

The pallbearers were Professors A. V.
Goldiere, H. T. Lilly, J. P: Williams, and
O, J. Thies; Captain George H. Weems,
Lieutenant R. C. Beckett, F. W. Henge-
veld, and H. M. Arrowood, the president
of the student body of Davidson. The
entire faculty, many students, and num-

Besides her husband, Mrs. Brown is
survived by her father, mother, three
sisters, and one brother, all residents of
Washington, D. C. Her brother, Jim, is
a student at Davidson at the present
time. This is his first year here. Rela-
tives from Washington were unable to
arrive before her death.

Mrs. Brown came to Davidson several
years ago and filled a position as a teach-
er in the public schools of the town.
She met Mr. Brown here and they were
married only seventeen months ago. She
was twenty-five years old at. the time of
her death.

Mrs. Brown was well known to all the
citizens of Davidson and to a great many
of the students here. She was also
known in other parts of the state, having
spent’ part of last year in Chapel Hill

at the University. Due to the short ill-
ness before her death, her friends, the

townspeople, and the students were
greatly shocked by the news of her
death, All extend to Mr. Brown their

deepest regrets and sympathy in his be-
reavement.

Davidson Freshmen
Lose to Duke Imps

Duke Fresh baseball team frocked the
Wildkittens Friday in a one-sided slug-
ging match, winning by the score of 21
to 5. The Duke team, playing on their
own grounds, outclassed the ,Davidson
Fresh in both fielding and batting.

Errors in the infield featured the rag-
ged playing of the Wildkitten nine. A
total of ten errors was amassed by both
the infield and outfield. All these were
well distributed between the whole team.

Hampton started in the box for Da-
vidson and remained for only a short
stay. In the second inning of the game,
the Duke batters ran wild, hitting timely
to make eight runs out of three hits. Men
on base from errors were easily scored
by these hits, one of which was a three
base hit, another a two base and the oth-
er a single. Kugler and Henderson were
also placed on the mound for the David-
son Fresh.

Keeping up the steady pace they start-
ed in the second ,jinning, the Duke team
totaled a score of twenty runs. Five runs
in the fifth was second “high score” for
the Blue Stockings. ;

Parish led the hitting for the Davidson
nine with a double and a single out of
three trips to the bat. Williams, Miller,
Gladstone and, Prevost each hit ‘one
apiece.

Several Duke men feature the day with
long, extra-base hits. One home-run, a
triple, six two base hits and many singles
were hit off the Wildkitten. pitchers.
Hawkins, an outfielder, was the most
consistent hitter for Duke, connecting
with four hits out of five times at bat.

LITERARY SOCIETIES.

Eumenean

Eu Society opened their meeting last
Thursday night, with a debate, the sub-
ject of which was, Resolved, that’ the
present method of holding Junior Speak-
ing should be abolished. The members
of the affirmative were Murray Chris-
tian and Dick Flinn.
posed by Bill Dobbins and Tom Preer on

They were op-

the negative.
After the debate a reading was ren-
dered by Mac King. Hugh White enter-.-

tained the society with a recitation of
Gunga Din, by Kipling. At this meeting
a joint committee, composed. of members
of the Phi and Eu societies was named
to petition the faculty that credits be
given for the work in literary societies.
In years past the societies held an en-
viable place of influence and importance
on the campus. Of late years this posi-
tion has gradually declined until the in-
terest in the work of the societies has
not been sufficient. The cause of this
decrease cannot be definitely determined.
It is possible that the increase in inter-
collegiate debating and in athletics has
drawn the interest of the student body.
It .is hoped, however, that if credit is
given by the college for the work done
in the societies that an increase will take
place in the results obtained.

It was also agreed at this meeting that
a joint “feed” of the two societies will be
held in the near future.

Philanthropic

Phi Society installed the officers elected

for the following year at their meeting
Thursday night. Henry Powell received
the office of President; Frank Hall, Vice-
President; Boyd, Secretary; Charley Mc-
Crae, First Critic; and R. C. Grady,
Treasurer:

A debate was heard between Hamilton
and Phillips, and current events were
read by John Crinkly.

In ‘the second annual South Carolina State
Tennis Tournament held recently in Charles-

ton, L. M. McCutchen and Dick Carr, Da-°

vidson stars, were finalists, opposing Jack
Mooney and Col. Waite Johnston, of Fort
Benning. Mooney is the holder of the singles
championship in the state and Colonel John-
ston is an old hand at the game, and the Da-

vidson team rushed them through four stren- |

uous sets to lose 6-8, 6-2, 7-5, 6-2.
Playing on even terms with Mooney and
Johnston, the Davidson -pair broke through |
from six all in games, to win the first set. |
Both were lobbing wonderfully well, and |
their tactics were a match for the two vet-
eran netmen. McCutchen’s frequent over-
head was roaring through his opponent’s de- |
fense for frequent points, and Carr con- |
tributed an invaluable steadiness and a good |
service. The Davidson team came from
behind a 0-3 disadvantage to win the Ast |
set at 8-6, but the experience and accuracy
of the veterans was always present, and the
older pair soon got going. Despite the speed |
and extraordinary power of McCutchen and |
Carr, the more experienced pair won the
second set at 6-2. Y
The Davidson pair came back and made a
strong bid for the third set, but lost this set
at 7-5, The score for the last set was 6-2.
McCutchen and Carr played a fast game
throughout, and furnished many thrilling
moments for the gallery. The drive and
force of the collegians was overcome only by
the experience of the veteran tennis stars.
