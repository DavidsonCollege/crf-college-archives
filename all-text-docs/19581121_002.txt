“Soft Sell” Or Leadership
Quo Vadis YMCA?

Monday's interview (see page one)
with YMCA President Vernon Broyles
left us with the impression that a once
effective campus organization now
falls far short of its standards of old.

President Broyles answered ques-
tions continually in vague generali-
ties which revealed, tacitly, that his
leadership of the YMCA was mostly
general in nature.

No organization can function well
with this type of leadership. From
what we can learn, the Y is scarcely
functioning at all. The’ membership
drive is not completed. only one mem-
bership program has been held — in
Short the “soft sell’ and the casual
touch seem to reign omnipotent.

If membership drops much
further, as it probably. will if the
“soft sell” is continked, and the lack
of dynamic leadership continues, the
YMCA could. within this student gen-
eration, become “just another organi-
zation.”

Nothing could give us more cause
for concern. No other organization on
the Davidson campus is as needed as

a well run Y with a meaningful and
fruitful program.

Having worked previously with
the YMCA. we realize the difficulties
involved in keeping it in “high gear.”
However, even considering these dif-
ficulties, we do not feel that even a
good effort is being made to over-
come these probiems.

If the effort is not made this year,
and made soon, the YMCA will be in
something worse than a poor position.

Fortunately, the picture is not to-
tally bleak. The “Great Books Pro-
gram.’ mentioned elsewhere in these
columns, is a step in the right direc-
tion. if it reaches fruition. The YMCA
has good potential leadership, both
in its cabinet and at its head, if it will
take strong hold of the situation and
act.

We can only watch and hope, but
we believe that the present situation
and future of the YMCA is the most
important problem currently facing
student leadership.

Something must be done. We trust
that it will be.

A Modest

Proposal

A venerable Davidson institution
‘which we greatly admire—but which,
we fear, has fallen into hard times —

is the library’s Permanent Reserve
shelf. Except for a number of dusty,

crumbling volumes published a cen-
tury ago (which would fall apart if
exposed to public handling), only a
very few books are kept there as a
part of the staff’s policy of vigilantly
defending student. morals.

Included on our Index Librorum
Prohibitorum are the Kinsey Reports,
James Joyce's Ulysses, James Jone’s
From Here To Eternity, Philip Wylie’s
Generation of Vipers, and Boccacio's
Decameron, plus several more whose
titles we must refrain from mention-
ing in these pages.

Considering the amount of danger-
ous material in the stacks which is
still directly accessible to the libidin-
ous student mind, this list is embar-
rassingly short. Any high school li-
brary has a better-enforced system of
protection.

Indeed, there are signs that the
library's resistance to literary tewd-
ness is about to collapse completely.
Only recently, an order was sent in
for a copy of the notoriously salacious
novel Lolita, after improper coercion
by certain teachers of literature.

The DAVIDSONIAN feels that a
reversal of this trend is imyerative.
The Permanent Reserve shelf should
be enlarged to fill the new wing, and
the stacks should be combed for con-
traband writings, which could then
be kept under lock and key. Only by
such drastic measures can we main-
tain our reputation and shield the stu-
dent body from the temptations of
the world, the flesh, and the devil.

the possibilities of initiating on this

much potential in the realms of intel-

lectual stimulation, understanding,

and sheer enjoyment.

The program would be patterned
after that which is scheduled each
semester at Franklin and Marshall
College. In this series, the members of
the student body who wish to par-
ticipate — and for the program to
be successful, a majority must take
part—read a selected contemporary
book. Several such selections have
been Whyte's The Organization Man,
Packard's The Hidden Persuaders,
and James McBryde Dabbs' Southern
Heritage.

Following this reading, the author
of the book is brought to the campus.
He then gives talks on his work, par-
ticipates in panel discussions, and is
generally open to questioning con-
cerning his ideas.

Such a program would provide the
Davidson student an opportunity to
shed the shackles of required reading
for a while and pursue to a greater
degree than is normally possible the
study of a subject of contemporary
importance.

As mentioned above, the partici-
pation of a large section of the stu-
dent body is essential to make this
program vital. By such widespread
participation, variant views will focus
on a single subject and the possible
conclusions which may arise from
such concentrated effort are almost
unlimited.

Too often, among the required
reading lists and parallel assignments,
we fail to find the relaxation and
pleasure that is abundant in reading.
As it is put by a writer in the fresh-
man literature text, “One forgets the
delight in the obligation, the elo-
quence in. the remembered pressure.”

Several groups on the campus
have already found the pleasure to be
derived from unrequired reading and
discussion. In the program here out-
lined is an opportunity for the entire
student body to enjoy this pleasure.

The DAVIDSONIAN soundly en-
dorses this Contemporary Author
program, and urges the students to
prepare for an adventure which might
have. fruitful consequences in the dis-
cipline of the mind for unrequired
reading throughout life.—G.W.R.

LETTER TO EDITOR

Calls For Debate Of Ideologies

(Editor’s Note: Letters to
the Editor should be typed,
double-spaced, and addressed
te the DAVIDSONIAN, Box
218. Space limitations make it
imperative that writers limit
their letters to two hundred
words.)

Dear Editor:

I, a “most sensitive come to
the edge of the bottomless pit”
fellow wish to present an
idea, which if followed up, will
result in a program which will
bring out some of the hidden
criticisms of those of us who
are not religion, philosophy, or
English majors and will pro-
vide a medium through which
various existing schools of
thought on religion and life may
meet for serious discussion and
debate.

TWO SCHOOLS

I think that there are at least
two general schools of thought
existing here at Davidson,
“liberal” and “conservative.” I
consider the “liberals” to be
those who have offered the
“what does it matter anyway?”
question, those who are pro-
foundly concerned with the gen-
eral problems of man but who
are not sure that Christianity is
the only answer. and those that
are considered either by them-
selves or others to be “hell

raisers.” I consider as “con-
servative” the Biblical funda-
mentalists, most of the David-
son pre-ministerial students,
and those who consider them-
selves to be good and righteous
before God but as superior and
chosen among men.

SINCERE INTEREST |

My idea is to form two
groups, liberal and conserva-
tive. and have them meet in
unaccrediated seminars and de-
bates. Each group will be re-
sponsible for its own organiza-
tion the only requirement for
membership being a sincere in-
terest in the program and a
willingness to participate active-
ly in one of the groups. It would
be the duty of each group to
present its side of the issues
debated in an intelligent man-
ner, which would involve re-
search by some of its members.
Perhaps interested professors
could participate and suggest
material to study. ;

Frankly I feel that we here
at Davidson have formed little
bands of thinkers which have
been non-communicative with
each other. We call each other
hypocrites and are intolerant
of each other. Consequently,
when we leave school, we go
our, own ways without knowing
what the others have said. We
blind ourselves to those people
and ideas from which we could
learn much. Each of us is in-

° ° ° e

complete in the experience of
life. Each of us has a part which
he can contribute to the other.

ALL CAN BENEFIT

1 don't think that we will
solve the tremendously pro-
found problems of the world,
nor do I believe that we will
always end in compromise, if
we follow through with such a
program. Yet I firmly believe
that all can benefit by coming
to a more intelligent under-
standing of our own positions
and the positions of others. I
think that the pre-ministerial
student will come to understand
more reality, and consequently
learn more about the nature of
a great number of the problems
that he will be facing in his
ministry. I think that we will
eliminate much pedantry and
prejudice which impede genu-
ine faith and true understand-
ing.

I realize that my presentation
above is certainly not a master-
piece and that my definitions
of liberal and conservative are
perhaps too radical and misrep-
resent those who would be con-
servative. in some issues and.
liberal in others. I am sure that
there are other problems also.
However I think that the gen-
eral idea is explicit, and with
my idea open for revision, I
await a response.

Unlimited Cuts Proposed;
1958 Labor Victory Cited

Allen Wells
Joe Markee

Dear Editor:

In principle, we agree whole-
heartedly with a recent DAVID-
SONIAN editorial recommend-
ing unlimited cuts. In fact, we
think this principle should in-
clude__vespers.

lt the earlier part of life
one must be controlled and
coerced by his parents be-
cause he is not yet able to
know what is best for him-
self. He must get a founda-
tion for the fater years of
life when he is completely
on his own.

In this later phase he will
have no parental reclusion. The
whole world will give him ad-
vice, and he must use what of
that advice he deems best, suid-
ed by his background and past
experience.

However, between these
times there must be a phase
of gradual transition. Empha-
sis should be placed on guid-
ing him (positive), but not
paternally coercing him (neg-
ative). In this period he must

PEANUTS

be mature enough to respect
leadership and to think for
himself.

If a college man must be
forced to go to class (or church),
he shouldn't be in college, and
there are plenty of eager stu-
dents who could use his place
to advantage.

Sometimes, though, one ob-
serves the Davidson man in
chapel or vespers and won-
ders if the student has
reached the age of maturity,
of which the simplest criter-
ion is decent conduct.

It seems that the faculty and
students at Davidson are at an
insipid stalemate. |The admini-
stration will not relax some pa-
ternal regulations because the
student demonstrates his imma-
turity; the student is some-
times frustrated by this father-
ly attitude and acts immature-
ly

Where the “original sin” lies,
we don't know, but think we
do know who must take the ini-
tiative. If we act as men. we
may demand a man's preroga-
tive.

Dear Editor:

I should like to respond to
your editorial in the November
14 DAVIDSONIAN on the out-
come of the recent, election.

This election was not a vic-
tory for tiberal Democratic
policies, nor was the outcome
due to any “obsolete” Repub-
lican policies.

lt was clearly a labor vic-
tory. Of the thirty senatorial
candidates who were backed
by labor, twenty-three of
them won. The unions con-
vinced the masses of people
that the cure-all economic
policies of labor will make
everything bright again for
the working man.

T do not think that the results
of this election have caused
any “sober thoughts among Re-
publicans about the future of
their party.” For it remains to
be seen how the people of this
country will feel after a few
years of labor control.

Conflict A Tale Of

Strife At The Stud

By JOHN TOUMARAS

“Hello, Fernirino, this is the Frog . . .” What really

did happen in Chicago?

Overheard Conversation on Procuring a Grilled

Cheese:

“I was over at the Stud the other night. All I wanted —
was a grilled cheese. It wasn’t crowded, only two of us;.
the other was waiting for an order. There were two count- .
ermen. One was busy. He was filling the milk machine.
The other? I’m not sure what he was doing. Something to
do with counting coffee cups. I didn’t want to bother
him while he was concentrating, so I waited.

“And I waited and waited and waited. Finally I
walked over to him and said ‘Hey, gimmea grilled cheese,
no mayonnaise, lightly toasted.’ feeling awful about dis-
turbing his cup-counting ritual. He looked up at me with
glassy eyes, reached for an order pad and a pencil, and
threw them at ime. ‘Here, you want it. You order it.’ And .
I wished then that the gods would smite him.

_ “But I was hungry, so I wrote, very neatly, my order,
spelling out each word fully so that there would be no
mistakes. I hate mayonnaise and mashed-flat cheese sand-
wiches. Again I waited, and waited, and waited. Finally
He took my order and rang for the cook. Feeling indig-
nant, I said, ‘If it’s not like | ordered, I’m not going to
take it. He replied, ’ A cheese sandwich is a cheese sand-
wich. You ordered it. You'll take it.

“Meanwhile, in the kitchen, the cook, oblivious to .
all this, was busily making my sandwich. I saw him make
a well-known movement (well-known to mayonnaise

* haters). I yelled, ‘Hey, no mayonnaise!’ He looked up

sheepishly, then crumpled a piece of bread in his hand,
and murmured an apology. Ten minutes later, an anemic
looking grilled cheese, no mayonnaise, lightly toasted was
placed before me. I inspected it carefully.

‘Is it to your liking, sir?’

“But I was hungry. I paid for the sandwich. I ate it.”
No kidding, fellows, this really happened.

THE PHILOSOPHES

{Fraternities Are
Now Meaningless

By DAVID ROBINSON

“I'm certainly fond of your
new house.”

“We like it, too, sir. Sorta
keeps down that hollowness we
used to feel. Why now we've
got this thick carpet which
hides the bareness of the floor,
ceiling sound-proofing to muf-
fle the roar of wind in soul, all
this massive, important-looking
furniture to fill every corner,
and these newly-shined trophies
to catch your eye and dull your
heart. We’re mighty happy, as
you can see.”

And a dimly-sensible disturb-
ing echo shrugs _ irresistibly
around the room, midst trophy
and chair, creating a cool draft
beneath the richness of the
rug, enveloping each who dares
to intrude with a demand of
his birthright in return for
ornamentation and prestige.

Fraternities are a uniquely
consistent feature of the Da-
vidson campus, with their ob-
vious lag of the spiritual to
the physical, and the smok-
ing = flax seemingly only
awaits the acolyte’s snuffer,

And yet we speak of spirit,
we spend a whole Rush Week
speaking of spirit, we claim to
be more than the sum total of
our member entities. But we
cultivate the use of outward
compulsions to maintain our to-
getherness rather than promote
the exercise of that inward li-
berty of expression which we
fear would bring about the dis-
integration of that which we
are trying to build up, but
which is nonetheless integral
in the end product which we
conceive as our goal.

Our activities as fraterni-
ties are so intertwined in ex-
ternalism and so-called bio-
logical drives as to render us
virtually incapable of ever

coining to understand those
with whom our initial em-
pathy is not too strong, or of
engaging those factors which
make us men in meaningful
relationship with others.

What we do speaks more
loudly than what we say, and
yet what we say bespeaks dual-
ism, failure, hope,and hypo-
crisy. If we would eliminate this
particular dualism, if we would
fulfill that hope which must
rather widely reside in us, let
us move into the establishing
of activity and opportunity in
which brother will come to un-
derstand brother.

Let us risk outward failure
by resting enterprise upon
the freedom of man to freely
participate with a large por-
tion of his total self, as we
endeavor to gain more of the
involvement of the total self
in fraternity. Then the spirit-
val will accompany the physi-
cal in a group significantly
more than the sum of its
isolated parts and yet exist-
ing in its parts and never
Prior fo its parts.

A dualism such as that to
which we have committed our-
Selves by past action demands
our best efforts towards its
resolution because of the vio-
lence it does to man and to
man created in the image of
God.

in shedding this particular
hypocrisy, we may abolish
Rush Week and its garble
and use an alphabetical ap-
portionment system to per-
petuate our twelve eating
clubs.

Or, significantly better and
truer to the nature, needs, and
desires of the Davidson student.
we may display that capacity
which we implicitly claim for
ourselves during Rush Week in
establishing opportunity * for
meaningful interchange.

More specifically, we may
examine the idea of fraternity
retreat as a means by which to
involve those faculties of men
which, with exercise, will create
a spiritual dignity equal to and
Supporting our physical pres-
tige.
