BY BOB RIERSON

A month or so ago there appear-
ed within the confines of this edi-
torial page a so-called letter to the
editor which bemoaned the condi-
tions for study in the dormitories.
It was pointed out that something
should be done to relieve the situ-
ation for the poor unfortunates who
are so misbegotten that they have
to engage in the distasteful occu-
pation of study, in this case, in their
own rooms. The claim was broach-
ed that an undue amount of varie-
gated chatter, epithetizing (oh,
Mr. Webster!), smashing yelling,
crashing, selling, mashing, and
kelling (it takes a light stretch
of the imagination for that one)
went_on that would be better con-
fined to other areas. Now this cor-
ner is not the place to go into a
detailed derogation of the writer’s
views on the subject, but I do
believe that the person was a bit
in error in his views when it is
so evident on all sides that during
the period from seven to eleven at
night, perfect peace and calm reign
in the halls for the benefit of all
those interested in getting some-
thing out of college.

In order better to prove my
point, might I take a typical case
that I have in my files? I shall
not’ mention his name, but he is
number D-4608752, if that will help
anyone to recognize him., This
Number D-4608752 lives on the
ground floor of Georgia Dorm right
in the middle of the hall, and so is
subject to all air wave disturbances
that might occur“in-any section of
his hall, not to mention the painful
tortures that assail his poor ears
from the room upstairs. On this
particular night that we look in,
Number ~D-4608752 is unusually
busy, having been assigned two
reviews to study for on the next
day and having only four hours in
which to dispose of the material
before him. He hurries back from
supper and seats himself in front
of the pile of notes before him,
ready to begin his tortuous path
through the thousands of words de-

maiding his attention. He leans
back, fixes his eye, and—-suddenly,
the door crashes inward’and a very
behemoth of a roommate strides
into his presence. This unwelcome
fellow obtrudes himself upon the
luckless Number D-46—(oh, call
him Oscar or Elmo or Ezra or what-
ever you will!) upon the luckless
Murgatroyd for a painful half hour
and then tramples out to the movie,
leaving holes in the wall where he
interspersed his song with harmless
taps.

Oswald breathes a sigh of relief,
only to be greeted by a shouting
conversation carried back and forth
between half of Watt sand the sec-
ond floor of Georgia which con-
tinues for some forty-five minutes
on the subject of which of the gladi-
ators should follow the vociferous
instructions of the other. When this
is finished, Herbert has fifteen min-
utes to devote to silent
study before the show lets out, and
the returnees conduct a _ 10,000
decibel session right outside his
door. After thirty minutes of this,
he timidly opens the door and begs
a bit_more silence of the conver-
sationalists, but h@ jis greeted with
an outraged stare and a drop in
temperature of some 25 degrees.
He lets his proud tail feathers
slowly droop and withdraws to the
sanctity of his quarters. About
this_time a track meet has devel-
oped between the two occupants of
the room overhead, so Juno folds
up his notes like the Arabs and
silently goes to bed, unable to with-
stand the eternal din any longer.
Whether he passed his reviews or
not is a question for you to decide.

tured after all!

Three Chosen
For Pub Board

Elections for next year’s Publi-
cations Board were held on Monday,
April 28, and for the first time this
year the winners were decided on
the first ballot. Bob Phillips,
editot of the Davidsonian, Bill
Simpson, editor of the Annual, and
Lenoir Kessler, business manager
of the Annual, were elected, win-
ning over Dan Tyler, business man-
ager of the Annual, Bob Cline,
business manager of the David-
sonian, and Jim Gribben, editor of
the magazine,

Board Duties

The Publications Board is com-
posed of two men from the faculty
and three men elected from the
publications. The Board governs
the policies of these campus pub-
lications and all matters of finance,
content, and number of issues. They
have the power to remove any busi-
ness manager who is not deemed
satisfactory and replace him with
someone else. The Board meets
several times during the year, the
meeting being called by any mem-
ber who has anything in particular
to discuss or anything upon which
the Board must take action.

ternity. Jim is also a member of
the “D” Club, having earned his
letter playing second base on the
1946 Wildcat baseball team. He
was almost a sure-shot for this
position again this year, until he
broke his ankle in an early season

scrinmmage.

Jim says he has had no experi-
ence as a cheerleader, but that he
is going to do his best to learn the
tricks of the trade before next fall.
He also gave a statement that is
well worth noticing. “The best
cheerleader in the business can’t
do any good without the whole-
hearted support of the student
body. If the students will give out
with their best support, then the
cheerleaders won’t feel that they
are working in vain. I want the
fellows next year to put out louder
and better yells and to be proud
of themselves for doing it.”

Governor Arnall could be de-
scribed as an optimistic proponent
of liberal democracy. He-is no
Senator Claghorn, but definitely
something distinctive among South-
ern politicians. In spite of his lib-
eralism,-he claims to be a true
Southerner who hopes to draw his
section up to a level with “the im-
perial East.” He is an idealist,
yet a conscientious worker who
desires for his nation a positiop
of lealership and respect in the
world.

Seminary

Eminent Professor of Bible
and Philosophy to Vacate
Position

Announcement of the election of
Dr.. Kenneth J. Foreman to the
chair. of Doctrinal Theology at
Louisville Theological’ Seminary,
Louisville, Ky., was made last week
by President Frank H. Caldwell of
the Seminary. The election is sub-
ject to ratification by the board
of directors at its annual meeting
in May.

Dr. Foreman, a native of New
York State, is known throughout
the South as a religious writer
and an outstanding preacher and
teacher. He will succeed Walter
A. Groves, who resigned January
1 at the Seminary to become presi-
dent of Centre College. After grad-
uating from Davidson in the class
of 1911, Dr. Foreman took further
training at Princeton University
and Seminary, Union Seminary—in
Richmond, and Yale University,
where he earned his Ph.D. In 1922
he joined the faculty at Davidson
as a professor of Bible and Ger-
man and in 1924 became. professor
of Bible and Philosophy, a position
which he has held since that time.

Louisville Seminary is a school
of 75 to 100 theological students
under the auspices of the North-
ern and Southern Presbyterian
churches.

As yet a successor to Dr. Fore-
man here at Davidson has not been
announced.

Watch for the day, the 10th of May!
PI KAPPA PHI

Those who went to Salem seem
to have had a fine time. Among
those present were Brothers Willie
Campbell, “Moe” Hardin, Ken
Clary, Robert Cline, Bud Edwards,
Walter Walker, John Walker, Er-
nest Hunter, Jim Elliott, and Bob
Huntley. “Boom” Jr. stayed here
last week end except for a few
minutes spent in the Mooresville
underworld. Higgie Sr. and Jr.
recuperated from last week end and
the Barringers went to U. S..C.
looking along the way for a car
they might have forgotten on pre-
vious trips. Pedro Sinclair went to
Wilmington and Fitz the Faithful
went to Warrenton to see Tootie.
Brother Charlie Reid cheeched
around Charlotte mostly. He,
Brothers Bill Robertson and Lan-
der, all with dates, spent some time
at the Lander’s river cabin—the
details are unavailable. We are
sorry that May Day at Queens has
interferred with our plans for the
party with the Kappa Delta soro-
rity here next week end.

KAPPA ALPHA

First we want to extend a wel-
come to all the alumni who are on
the campus today for the Kappa
Alpha Homecoming to unveil a
memorial plaque for the brothers
killed in the war. Brother Gracey
is to be congratulated for the good
job he has done in arranging this
occasion.
