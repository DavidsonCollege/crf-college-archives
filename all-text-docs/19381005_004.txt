What's the use of having two potential All-Americans in one

He is as cool and
level-headed a player as any coach could wish for. He beat Davidson

The world’s sporting eye will turn this week from King Football
to America’s National pastime—Baseball, and the World Series.
The Yankees against the Cubs, or should it be said the Yankees
over the Cubs. With such an array of talent like Joe DiMaggio, Lou
Gehrig, Bill Dickey, George Selkirk, and Red Rolfe, the Cubs will
have to do some fancy stepping to win the coveted world cham-
pionship. The Yanks have a decided edge in pitching with Red |
Ruffing, who has won more games than any flinger in the majors,
Lefty Gomez, who is coming back to old time form and a crew
of fine relief tossers. The highlight of the series should be a pitch-
ing duel between either Ruffing or Gomez and Diz Dean, Cubs’
talkative pitcher. And while on the subject of baseball, it was too
bad that Hank Greenberg, Detroit’s big firstbaseman, failed to set
a new home-run mark.

SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE!

In last week's column the soccer situation was discussed. Evidently
some action was taken to aid them, but one thing—when they were given
the right to use the intramural field for a practice ground—is out of the
question. Why should a group of 25 men take away grounds where

always been used for those members of the student body not participat-
ing in sports. The t@ims have two good fields, Richardson and the
Freshman grounds. Why not let the rest of the school have something?
Of course the field on the south side of Chambers Building could be used
and everything would turn out all right.

DAVIDSON vs. ERSKINE

Davidson rules as top heavy favorite for the first time this year
in their coming game with Erskine’s Seceders. The Wildcats should
take the boys from Due West, S. C., in easy fashiotf“as no injuries,
with the exception of Bob Johnson, reserve guard, reported. Bill
Beaty and Captain Dave Warden, who did not see action against
Duke will be ready to go again, and with the rest of the squad in
fair condition, things should be different. The Seceders have not
fared so well, losing games to South Carolina, Catawba, and Pres-
byterian. Their only score came in the Catawba game. Erskine,
like Davidson, is hampered by the lack of reserves and depend upon
about 15 men to play the full 60 minutes. The game, however,
should prove an interesting one with Davidson bidding for her sec-
ond ‘victory and the Seceders trying to break a string of defeats.
Davidson's running attack, which has not been on the brighter side
so far this year, will have a chance to prove its worth against the
light Erskine line. Head Coach McEver, on the other hand, is

taking no chances and is pushing his forces hard in preparation
for the tilt.

Duke’s powerful Blue Devil
eleven pfoved to be too much
for a light but game Davidsen
team as they whipped the
Wildcats 27-0 on Saturday af-
ternoon at Durham. Eric Tip-
ton and Bob O'Mara bore the
brunt of the Duke attack while

Bill Davis and Archie Steed
did most of Davidson’s ball
handling.

Davidson, outweighed by Duke's
heavier line and backfield, fought
gamely, but were clearly outclassed
from the start. The Blue Devil
backs constantly smashed the 'Cat
line as they saved their passes for
future games. Davidson's running
attack was never able to gain, but
for a brief time passes carried the
‘Cats forward until a Duke inter-
ception ended this threat on the
Devil 47-yard line.

Duke's first score came as the
climax to an 80 yard drive down
the field in the first quarter. Rob-
inson dashed through tackle for 19
yards and the six points. Ruffa
then scored the only conversion of
the afternoon. O'Mara went over
from the one yard stripe for the
second six pointer to end a 39 yard
march. Nine plays later Blue Devil
linesmen blocked Steed’s attempted
punt from behind his own goal
line and Graham, 'Cat tackle, fell
on it for a safety and two points
for the Dukes.

The third quarter ended as the
Duke team advanced to the David-
son- 10 yard marker. After a short
punt by the ‘Cats, Duke again
scored whéin Wesley McAfee pick-
ed up seven yards and a_touch-
down over tackle. The last score
came late in the last period as
O'Mara passed to Marion over the
Davidson goal line. Davidson halt-
