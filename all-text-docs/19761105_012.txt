Davidson all the way. The
Cats’ offense continued to
move .the ball on the ground,

pounded on Quaker fumbles to
shut down Guilford drives.

the Cats went ahead for good
on Pete Legler’s stunning 51
yard run. McCarthy's pass to
Page Walley for the two-point
conversion was complete, and
the Cats led 14-6.

After Gary Stokes recov-
ered a Quaker fumble on the
Davidson 33 yard line, the
Wildcats drove for the score,
