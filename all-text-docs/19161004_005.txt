THE FORUM

THE YOUNG MAN'S ENEMY

Mr. Edison says, in speaking of the
degeneration produced by narcotics and
cigarettes: “Unlike most narcotics, this
degeneration is permanent and uncon-
trollable. J employ no person who
smokes cigarettes.”

When I read these words of Mr. Edi-
son, this thought came to me: What
chance have we cigarette smokers at
Davidson College—with our dips under
our arms—of securing a position with
the great inventor? Were we to apply
to him for a position, a college diploma
would doubtless count, but there is
something else that counts morc—wheth-
er or no we are a cigarette smoker.

Upon this same score Mr. Henry
Ford says: “If you will study the his-
tory of almost any criminal, you will
find that he is an inveterate cigarette
smoker. Boys who smoke cigarettes, as
a usual thing, go with other smokers to
the pool rooms and the saloons. “he
cigarette draws them down. Hence, if
we can educate them to the dangers of
smoking, we shall perform a service.”

At the North Carolina Agricultural
and Mechanical College any one who is
detected smoking cigarettes three times
is expelled. [am not committing: myself
as to whether or not we should have such
a law here at Davidson; but certainly
we should do something. If nothing
else, we could inaugurate a campaign,
the purpose of which would be to edu-
cate all to the evils of the cigarette.

Let's hear from others on the subject.

A NUISANCE

Mr. Editor, ! wish you would write
something like this in Tre Davinson-
SAN next week. Before | came to Dav-
idson I read in the catalogue about the
Honor System that was in vogue here.
And yet the first night after [| got here
I had some new springs taken off my
bed, and since then T have had one elec-
tric light and three books to disappear.
I can’t see where this is any different
from stealing. | don't want to seem
Fresh, but I don’t see the Student Coun-
cil is so strict on cheating as I hear they
are,-and yet they don’t control this
cheating.. It looks to me like both
should come under the Honor System.
If I could afford to lose lights and
books, I would not mind it, but T can't.

« CAESAR.

Plain writing this. There are some
at Davidson, and we are glad to say
that they are in a small minority, who
do not seem to consider that the taking
of lights from another's room or from
the hallways is stealing.

Let’s help the Student Council ferret
out a rogue or two-of this nature and
we will rid ourselves of this nuisance.

TO THE ALUMNI

A lack of vital connection between the
Alumni and the Student Body has been
noticeable in years past at Davidson.
We believe that the columns of The
Forum supplies this needed link between
Alumni and Student Body. For that
reason you are urged to use these col-
umns. No matter what the nature of
vour communication may he, send it in.
and the editors will be only too glad to
print it.

A PRESCRIPTION OFFERED.
First Student:

on that review.”

idson. I like the place very well; but
this work is something else.”

Such, in substance, was the conversa-
tion of two Freshmen as recently over-
heard by another student. Well, your
case is not bad. Take a dose of hard
work exch day, and, that you may not
lose any of its good effects, take oc-
casionally a portion of perseverance.
The writer has withstood the attacks of
the faculty for three years by using a
prescription similar to the one suggested,

Don't become discouraged, new men,
if your efforts fail to produce the result
that you had expected. Your work will
become easier to you as time passes and
you become more accustomed to your
work.
