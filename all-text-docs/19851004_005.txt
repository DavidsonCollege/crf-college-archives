Friday, October 4, 1985 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Artists Series welcomes Davidson native for first concert

By BILL BUGG
The Charlotte Symphony Or-
chestra, directed by Leo

Driehuys, performed works by
Mozart and Beethoven Wednes-
day night in Love Auditorium to
begin Davidson College’s 1985-
86 Artists Series. The concert fea-
tured clarinetist Daniel McKel-
way, a native of Davidson.
Driehuys opened the concert
with Mozart’s Overture to Don
Giovanni, K. 527. The opera,
Don Giovanni, is a rendition of
the ancient legend of a man who,
upon slaying the father of a young
woman he wanted to seduce, is
dragged to hell by the ghost of the
victim. The first part of the Over-

ture introduces the themes of the
opera, but the material of the sec-
ond part is not repeated.

Daniel McKelway performed
the second work of the program,
Mozart’s Concerto for Clarinet in
A Major, K. 622. Mozart was
largely responsible for going the
clarinet the prominence it now has
among woodwind instruments.
He wrote three major works
featuring the clarinet, including
the Concerto for Clarinet.
McKelway played with confi-

‘dence and great control in illus-

trating the instrument’s capacity

to blend well with strings
Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7

in A Major, Op. 92 was the eve-

ning's final work. The symphony
first performed in 1813 as a Uni-
versity of Vienna benefit concert
for soldiers wounded in a battle
against Napoleon, drives with
preat force toward survival, to-
ward life, in the face of a great
enemy. Leo Drihuys handled the
great work brilliantly, allowing its
force and drive to affect the lis-
tener.

Driehuys was born in the
Netherlands, where he studied
piano and oboe at the Royal Con-
servatory of Music. He made his
conducting debut with the Nether-
lands Opera in 1961, and was ap-
pointed conductor of the Gelders
Orkest in Amhem, Holland, in

1970. In 1977, Driehuys was ap-
pointed music director of the
Charlotte Symphony Orchestra.

McKelway: A Profile

Clarinetist Daniel MeKelway,
20-year old son of Adelaide and
Religion Professor Alexander
McKelway, performed Mozart’s
Concerto for Clarinet

After beginning to play the
clarinet when he was eight years
old, he continued his clarinet

studies at the North Carolina

School for the Arts. He is cur-
rently a junior at the New England
Conservatory, where he is study-
ing under Harold Wright, princi-
pal clarinetist of the Boston Sym-

had too much success simply to cut off and
start over. It’s and evolutionary process
rather than a revolutionary process, as I see
it.

On the side of servantood, it’s a little bit
more complicated because that’s not so eas-
ily quantifiable. We can tell how we're
doing on the side of scholarships. We can
tell by the quality and productivity of our
faculty, the quality and productivity and
comparative accomplishments of our stu-
dents. But, on the servanthood side, I think
it is an obligation of all of us in the college
who are in the positio of teaching and ad-
ministering to remind our colleagues in the
college who are students of the obligations
that they have to the larger society. I’m not
hesitant to say to somebody, “Hey, haven't
you thought about this or that avenue of ser-
vice,” and I do that without pause: And a
number of other folks at the college do the
same.

Also, as a part of scholarship, we re-
mind ourselves of the changing world
around us and of the places in that changing
world where people with a Davidson educa-
tion can make a difference. That is not al-
ways to say be a missionary or a doctor or
some “serving” vocation. It is to say every
one of us who graduates from Davidson
College will find himself or herself in-

volved in the life of a particular community
for the rest of our lives. In many of those
communities the Davidson folks are the
backbone. They are the ones who are de-
pended upon because of their interest in
folks, because of their personal integrity
and because of the talent they have to keep
that community going in a positive direc-
tion.

For me one of the most impressive
things about this job is the incredible wealth
of talent that is invested in such a positive
way in towns and cities all around the coun-
try. You never really know how much a per-
son has learned to serve, but then somebody
pops up who was in your class twenty five
years ago and all of a sudden here is a per-
son who has taken on the Red Cross or a
particular housing project in some commu-
nity. And the churches seem to be popu-
lated with Davidson folks who somewhere
along the way discovered that the religious
aspect of life is one of great significance and
therefore take leadership there are well.

I don’t know what we will do in these
years ahead that will be different in regard
to either scholarship or servanthood. But, I
think that I will feel myself a failure in my
efforts at Davidson if we don’t see con-
tinuity with that rich heritage as we move
toward the future.

phony Orchestra.

McKelway’s third concerto
appearance, his previous two
being with the orchestras of the
North Carolina School for the Arts
and the New England Conservat-
ory. He was a winner of the 1984
Young concert Artists Interna.
tional Auditions and the 1983 Na-

Search.

McKelway made his
Washington, D.C., debut last
Febuary, and will make his New
York debut this January at the
96th Street Y. His musical ambi-
tions are to combine teaching and
performing, particularly as a sol-
oist and chamber musician.
