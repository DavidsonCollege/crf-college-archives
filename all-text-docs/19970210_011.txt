THE DAVIDSONIAN

ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1997

To the beat of the rhythm of the night

By MArGaret LumPKIN

As I neared Johnston Gym last
Friday evening, I could hear the
beat of hundreds of drums before I
set foot on the steps in front of the
building. The very walls shook
with a confused but irresistible beat
that rattled my bones as I hurried
inside. This was the drumming
circle; the kick-off event to Solidar-
ity Week, which runs through Feb-
ruary 14.

Inside the already warm gym, a
large crowd was gathered around a
small central stage where Arthur
Hull, a master drummer and leader
of the circle (who bears a strong
resemblance to Dr. Abbott in the
English department), swung wide
his arms in welcome at the swarm-
ing mass of late-comers. It truly
was acommunity event; while there
were more students than Davidson
townspeople present, I saw young
and old, black and white faces, all
intent on their drums, their hands
making the rafters shake above our
heads. I hurriedly picked out a
medium-sized barrel drum and
made my way to the group.

Hull let us beat our drums silly
for a while, guided by the deep bass
of two master drummers seated on
the stage, keeping the beat with
larger instruments.

Then he led us through a series
of rhythms, dividing us into groups
and having us “‘answer” each other
in turn.

The experience was exhilarat-
ing; first one half of the crowd
would silence, with the other beat-
ing a powerful rhythm. Then, in
full force, the other half would join
back in, making us realize justhow
powerful we were as a combined
group.

Hull, as the master of ceremo-
nies, explained how eachdrum was
a different voice; the frame drums,
the barrel drums, the deeper bass
drums, and all the other percussion
instruments together created a
unique symphony. The metaphor

was obvious; each of us has a voice,
and each contributes to the commu-
nity — both the Davidson and the
global community — in a vitally
different way.

As we became more comfort-
able with our instruments and with
the “global” rhythms running
through our hands and bodies, our
voices became more integrated into
a symphony of sound. No longer
was this the cacophony I had come
upon, panting, running up the stairs
at 7:35 p.m. This was real music.

I left that evening exhausted,
with red painful hands (and a slight
headache), but with a heart full of
the rhythm and spirit of the global
drum
