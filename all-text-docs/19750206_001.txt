Meredith Hall reported to the
SGA Senate.on the status of his
counseling at Davidson at the
Tuesday meeting. Reports were
also. heard’ from” Karl

Goodhouse, Bo Hunter, Rick .

Roylance, and Martin Eakes.

Hall is required to report to
the Senate every term as part of
his contract to provide coun-
seling services funded by the
SGA Senate. ‘‘The emphasis in
the SGA program is to improve
the quality of relationships at
Davidson, something that ap-
pears to be lacking otherwise,”’
said Hall.

Hall contrasted Hits views on

Night Exam Plan
After EPC Rejection

The Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC)
proposal for implementation of
night exams in the self-
scheduled exam period by a
vote of 3-2 Monday.

The committee then voted
unanimously to take the
proposal before the faculty

\without recommendation. A
student will be allowed to
present the proposal.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs and EPC Chairman
John M. Bevan indicated his
lack of favor for the proposal.
He said that the eight exam
periods now scheduled were
sufficient without ‘the addition
of two evening periods.

The proposal calls for two
exam periods to run from 7 to 10
p.m. on the first two days of the
examination period.

Class of ’76 Student Govern-
ment Association Senator Mar-
tin Eakes expressed his disap-
pointment with the EPC vote.

“The whole goal of self-
scheduled exams lies in making
the scheduling of exams as
flexible as possible for students.
I think night exam periods
provide a significant increase in
flexibility,’’ Eakes said.

*“ Bevan suggested that a three-
day exam period with two night
exam periods, one each of the
first two nights, would be an ac-
ceptable proposal to him.

“That’s not the issue,” Eakes
responded. ‘‘What’s - magic
about the number eight? If you
have the people to administer
the exams, there’s no
problem,”’ Eakes said.

Bevan’s proposal provides for
eight exam periods, either two
periods during each of four days
or a three-day exam week with
two night exam periods.

Eakes felt that such a
proposal would not be ac-
ceptable to the student body.

“We asked specifically about
that alternative in a student
referendum last year, and 80
percent of those responding
voted against that proposal.
Students have made their

defeated a

position perfectly clear on
that,’’ Eakes maintained.

A proposal for night exams
was defeated by the faculty last
fall, and the same proposal was
tabled by the EPC last spring.

Mrs. Donald L. Kimmel Jr.,
administrator of: the exam
distribution center, favors a
trial night exam period.

“Besides receiving the ap-
proval of Mrs. Kimmel, we
have already.secured a_suf-
ficient number of student volun-
teers to help with exam
distribution.

“With such support I see no
reason why~we should not in-
stitute night exams, ”’
remarked EPC _ student
representative John Taylor
(’76).

Faculty representative on the
EPC expressed _ several
dissatisfactions with the night
exam proposal.

““Students have ample time to
write their exas under the
existing system.

“T don’t think most students
even have three exams to ake,
so why should we add on ad-
ditional examination periods at
night?”’ asked one EPC faculty
representative.

“The faculty has bent over
backwards to help students. If
night exams. are _ instituted,
faculty members will feel
obligated to remain in their of-
fices from 7 to 10p.m. to answer
student questions concerning
the exams.

“I don’t really believe studen-
ts would take advantage of the
night exams. The satisfaction
show that those who take two
exams in one day usually do so
on the last day of the
examination period’’, said
another faculty member.

In a SGA campus poll con-

ducted last year, 92 percent-of’ |
the student body voted in favor .

of instituting the option of night
exams.

A similar percentage of the
student body expressed the
desire to sustain a four-day
examinaton period.

views of the administration.
Hall indicated that the ad-
ministration tended to see his
role as counseling students with
drastic problems, while he felt
that students should be seen
before a problem reaches a
drastic status. ©

Hall later mentioned that an
entire hall from a freshman
dormitory had consulted him on
the quality of life at Davidson. ,

“T think it’s pretty impressive
that a whole floor approached
me in a commonly held view
that these people’s personal and
social lives were pretty rotten,”’
Hall said.

“People are more demanding
about every aspect of their lives
now. They want to be able to

come here and feel that they‘’re
growing as people. They are ex-
pecting more, -and many feel
they’re not getting it.

“This is pretty consistent
with a number of people I’ve
talked with at Davidson. Many
feel a loss of confidence in that

they don’t feel that they’re

developing anything socially at
Davidson.”’

In a purely statistical sense,
Hall has seen 138 different
people so far this year. He in-
dicated that the majority of
people see him from one to
three times, while some have
been in as many as 14 times.

Karl Goodhouse reported on
other developments on coun-
seling at Davidson.

en

February 6, 1975

‘‘In the area of human
sexuality there is a course in the
planning stages.’’ Goodhouse
added that Dr. Amelia Dockery
has been overloaded in her
duties as psychologist so far
this year, while Dr. W.
Gateman Workman has seen
only seven people this term.

Dockery and Workman are
employed by the college ad-
ministration as is Hall for the
equivalent of one day of coun-
seling each week. Hall works
one additional day funded by
the Senate.

Bo Hunter reported on the
Budget, Buildings and Grounds
Committee meeting. It was an-
nounced that extra expenses
will be met next year by in-
creasing tuition $300 and dorm
fees $50.

“Expenses are being cut by
eliminating the public lectures
program and by cutting in-
ternational education to a bud-
get of $8000,”’ siad Hunter.

Hunter added that other
minor cuts were also being
made. Dick Gregory was

- brought to campus to speak

from public lecture funds last
year. William F. Buckley Jr.
was a Reynolds lecturer.

Senator Rick Roylance repor-
ted on actions by the Buildings
and Grounds Committee.

_ Roylance stated that Chambers

will not be locked, a pay
telephone will be installed in the
lobby of Johnston Gymnasium,
anq that landscaping is being
taken care of between Duke and
the library.

“From now on, the library is
going to be padlocked so that
the only way to get out if you are
locked in after hours is to set off
an alarm at an emergency
door,’’ Roylance said.

Senator Martin Eakes repor-
ted on the status of night exams.

“The Educational Policy
Committee decided not to ap-
prove night exams. They added
that we could take it to the
faculty unapproved, but it
would probably get shot dow:
pretty badly,’’ said Eakes.

In other actions, the Senat:
