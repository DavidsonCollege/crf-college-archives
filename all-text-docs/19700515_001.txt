Dying Fraternities Thrive On College’s Indifference

AN ANALYSIS

By RUSS MERRITT
Associate Editor

(ED. NOTE: This is the last in a series on ‘“Fraterni-
ties in Crisis.)

“If you and I want to form a fraternity of bow-legged
men, it is our priviledge to do so. Our bow-legged
fraternity does not infringe upon the rights of the
knock-kneed men, because they, too, are free to form
their own groups.” “

In other words, the fraternities: argue that man
is by nature a social being and desires to belong to
an intimate in-group to fulfill his sense of belonging.

Furthermore, the fraternities contend, on a col-
lege campus intimate friendships with people of the
same ideals are impossible without fraternities.

Another argument that fraternities use to defend
their policies is that, after all, man does have an in-
alienable right to select his ultimate friends, and thus
a grolip has the right to perpetuate itself in such a
manner as it desires. Selection of new friends, and
ultimately fraternity members, is a demonstration‘ of
taste, not superiority.

In reflecting upon these pro-fraternity arguments,
one observation stands out above all the others: fra-
ternities through these explanations are defending
an exclusive, selective, and by its very nature snob
bish and undemocratic system. Even in these defenses
the idea of selection and exclusion within an institu-
tional system is a basic and accepted assumption.

And it appears to. be the major fault found in
such fraternity systems. The psychological problem
of institutional rejection, feelings of alienation, and
the consequences can be indeed overwhelming, as

any psychologist will contend.

Another fault of the present fraternity system
is that “brotherhood”: as used by the fraternities in
their rush speeches, etc. is only an empty phrase.
This “brotherhood” concept is recognized by most
fraternity members as something far from actuality,
while it increases feelings of bitterness among those
rejected by the frats.

A third criticism of the Davidson fraternity sys-
tem lies in the realm of what it does to the college
itself. For instance, past student body president Peter
Hobbie cited before the Social Patterns Commission
last year that no senior Independent that he knew of
would send his son to Davidson.

Also, it is reported that many students have
chosen other schools over Davidson because of the

fraternity system, and many alumni no longer give
contributions to the school because it continues to
house a discriminatery system. ss

As long as Davidson operates even nominally
under a Christian ethic, then the Christian perspec-
tive should also be considered.

The Christian ethic, first of all, demonstrates a
respect for persons, a characteristic often lacking
on the fraternity court. Second, along with showing
each person respect, Christian doctrine teaches that
each individual should be accepted as such — an
individual — and should be accepted for his individ-
ual worth. Unfortunately, fraternities all too often
fail to follow these principles. +

So what are the alternatives to what now exists

(See FRATERNITY, Page Four)

Spencer Endorses
Suspending Class

As early as 1894, 54-non-fraternity members pe-
titioned the college administration to abolish fraterni-
ties from the Davidson campus. Since that time more
anti-fraternity movements have evolved, the strongest
of which is still in progress.

Yet because of indifference and lack of action
on the part of the college itself, the fraternity sys-
tem remains to a.great degree unscathed and appar-
ently secure in its present dying form.

There are numerous arguments that the fraterni-
ty system nationwide and at Davidson has used to
defend its cause. Perhaps an analysis of these argu ~
ments would best clarify the fraternity attitudes.

The college curriculum stated the National In-
terfraternity Council several years ago, leaves a vac-
uum for the college student. Without social clubs
such as fraternities, the student exists in a sort of
Void, a one-sided academic wasteland that -fails to
Satisfv his needs.

Expounding ‘upon this, the national IFC, in the
words of dts president Claude Teagarden, argued that

Hopes For CRC

Reversal Come

To Dead End

By JOE SMITH

Associate Editor

The Ad Hoc Committee for
the Protection of Students
has made its final appeal
to several faculty commit-
tees, but with no
result,

In its efforts to promote
a change in admission and
curriculum policy, the Ad
Hoc group met with the°Cur-
riculum Requirements Com-
mittee (CRC) in an open
meeting on Thursday, May 7
and with the’ Admissions
and Financial Aid Committee
on Tuesday, May 12.

The open meeting resulted
in what members of the ad-
ministration called ‘‘good
dialogue,” but brought no
substantive change in policy.

“Tt was.sort of like a
Youth Fellowship meeting,”
said senior John Shott.

“We would bring up pro-
posals and the committee
members would say it was
a’ good idea and smile and
that would be it. There were
no promises of action at
alley

There being no substantive
action taken on either cur
riculum or, admissions, it is
doubtful «that the Ad Hoc
Committeeé’s activities have
succeeded in expediting the
six case, usually involving
ROTC contracts, which
brought it into being.

Commenting on this, Ad
Hoc Committee chairman
David Sweatt noted that,
as our original reason for
existence is concerned, 1
consider that our efforts have
failed.” a

In the meeting with the
Admissions and Financial Aid
Committee, Sweatt and senior
Hugh~—Baskin —presented—a
proposal for reform of pre-
sent policy with regard to
readmission of a _ student
who leaves school to termin-

apparent —

ate his ROTC obligation.

The proposal stated that:
(1) Students who leave the
college in good standing
academically and _— socially
should be guaranteed read-
mission, provided that they
inform the college of their
intention of returning well
in advance of reentry.

) (2) The creation of a’‘sep-
arate committee, consisting
of the Registrar, the Dean
of Students, and an advisory
group of students, to deal
with controversial readmis-
sion cases.

The committee agreed with
the intent of the proposal,
although the majority opin-
ion, solicited informally, fav-
ored the treatment of read-
mission cases by a subcom-
mittee of ‘the admissions
committee rather than an
independent body.

William Hight, chairman
of the admissions committee,
noted that half of the com-
mittee dealt with financial
aid while the other half had
no specific duties, this being
a good source for a new sub-
committee.

Hight said that some ac
tion would be taken on the
proposal at an undisclosed
future date.

At Open End Monday night
College President Samuel R.

suspension of classes for a

“‘\ feel this would be a good

“The faculty might consider
this proposal if it has enough

Infirmary’s Records Procedure
Raises Major Question Of Privacy

By STEPHEN ROADY
Staff Writer

A procedural difference be
tween Dean of Students Rich-
ard C. Burts Jr? and College ~
Physician Dr. William A,
Davis over the availability
of infirmary records has rais-
ed a question involving the
privacy of the student
college-doctor relationship.

Dr. Davis reports into a
Dictaphone the visit, com-
plaint, and treatment of each

organize
thoughts on “the
vigil.

Professors R. David Kay-
lor, William E. Jackson, and
Frederick R.’Gaige were an-
gered by the meager re-
sponse of faculty, but en-
couraged by the support of
students and black people in
the town.

They collected 1251 signa-
tures on the petition to Nix-
on. Over 600 Davidson stu-
dents signed, as did 350
North Mecklenburg students.

In the town, 200. blacks,
as against 100 whites, , in-
cluding 75 Davidson faculty,
as well as Mooresville and
Davidson residents signed.

Gaige ran off three Xerox
copies of the petition. One
copy goes to each of North
Carolina’s senators and one
to Jackson’s ‘‘good friend”
Charles Jonas. ‘The original
has been sent to President
Nixon.

Although all three profes-
sors said“they were, impres-
sed by student support, they
were disappointed that few
faculty members showed up.

Reportedly, some _ profes-
sors were “‘fed up” with dem-
onstrations. Gaige said ‘’This
just raises the level of frus-
tration, possibly causing vio-
lence.” Kaylor called it “‘an

irresponsible excuse.”

The three were impressed
with political science pro
fessor Jon Fuller’s response
Although he agreed with
Nixon's’ action, he reported
having “meaningful dialogue”
on the subject

All three leaders felt that
Student-faculty barriers were
down.

Kaylor said that he talked
with some of the 88 students
that spent Thursday night
by the’ post office until far
into the night, and that he
felt the demonstration had
been a “learning experience.”

Gaige was optimistic about
the black-white. relations that
developed during the three
days.

Many blacks, besides sign-
ing the petition, demonstrat-
ed in the picketing of the
post office.

The three. professors ex-
pressed hope that some of
these relationships could be
further developed. It was,
Gaige continued, probably the
first chance this year ‘‘to
tap support from _ outside
the .college community.”

Kaylor said. that the vigil.
led to ‘“‘dialogue rather than
violence.” 4

Many students who did not
participate -still wrote their

a triplicate copy of the re-

corded information, sends
one copy to the Direotor of
Student. Housing, one cepy

to the College*@haplain, and
keeps one copy in the Dean's
Office.

The permanent cards, along
with the erased tape, are then
sent back to the infirmary.

Dr. Davis contends that the
procedure needs to be mod
ified. “I think that there are
many instances in which the
student needs to know that
the information will be kept
confidential,” he

In the Dean's defense, he
comments that “there are

Says.

affect his - aca
performance, and in
those instances the Dean is
not only entitled to but needs
this information,”

However, he — continues,

v\hen the health problems
do not affect the student's
academic performance, “‘his
health matters ought to be

between himself and the
doctor.”*

Dean Burts argues that all
the infirmary records are
necessary? to the optimum
functioning of his office. He
says that the information
makes him better able to
respond to personal inquiries
from professors and others
concerning the students.

Burts further maintains’
that “Davidson is a close-
knit residential institution
with concerns beyond strictly
academic ones. In this re-
gard, it is highly appro-
priate that we have profes-
sional information about the
student covering numerous
aspects of his life.”

The information, says the
Dean, “is not sought with
any harmful intention. As far
as I know this information
has never been unwisely
used.”

In reference to the prob
lem posed by the divulging
of delicate health matters,
Burts states that the infir-
mary information is profes-
sional information and_ is

a

not broadcast.

He added, however, that
“if there are-certain things
hich: Dr. Davis feels should
be kept off the record, then
he should keep them off the
record.”

ed here. Yet Gonly six have-

enrolled.”
Spencer said that Davidson
attempted to recruit blacks

through a number of differ-.,

ent sources including the Na
tional Scholarship Fund for
Negro Students, and the Na-
tional Merit Achievement
Tests.

“Letters were not only
sent to the black National
Merit finalists and semi-fi-
nalists, but also to those who
had achieved reasonably high
scores,” he said,

To improve our recruiting
coverage the college hired
Calvin Murphy tast summer
fo personally visit prospec-
tive black applicants.

And this year we had a

weekend of activities here
for those blacks who seem-
ed interested in Davidson,”
he_ said,
_ Spencer ‘cited few social
opportunities, small — size,
southern orientation, and
rural location as unappealing
factors which dissuade many
blacks from enrolling.

“However, we do need a
black member on our admis
sions staff,” said Spencer.
“Jobs have been offered to
two people so far, but these
men are hard to come by.”

Spencer also noted that
blacks are being sought for
other personnel openings. He
said that when openings do
occur, blacks are the first
considered.

Concerning student dissent

said, “‘Any dissent

the rights of the individual
in every case.”

There are two methods by
which this suspension — is
brought into effect. Either
a case is brought up before
the courts or the college
president may personally
handle the matter.

Turning to the subject of
self-scheduled exams, Spen-
cer said that the proposal
is presently before the Edu-
cational Policy Committee.

He noted that the Honor
Court has expressed grave
doubts to the committee
about possible honor viola-

flons under the proposed
system. =

Incoming Freshman Class

Will Include Six Blacks

By GRAY WILSON
Asst. Managing Eidtor

As of this week, six black
applicants: have definitely de-
cided to enroll at Davidson,
in the freshman class next
fall,

According to H. Ed
munds White, Director of
Admissions, the six have al-
ready sent in their deposits,
while eleven other accepted
black applicants have with-
drawn.

Of the twenty-three appli-
cations submitted, only five
were rejected. One applica-
tion is still pending, and
White said it would prob-
ably be \jaccepted.

Several other incomplete
applications were filéd which
could not be considered for
lack of transcripts or neces-
Sary test scores.

The applications ranged
over a small geographical
area, coming mostly from
South Carolina, North Caro-
lina, and Virginia.

In comparison with statis-
tics on black admissions over
the past four years, this next
year shows an increase of
about four students.

Of the 30 applicants last
year, ten were accepted and

two decided to come. Be-
ene 1966 and 1968, no more
than ten applications

received from blacks each
year with an acceptance of
three or four and an enroll-
ment of one or two students

were

Black students are actively
recruited by White, Calvin
Murphy, Bobby Allen and
other students. In
athletes and sons of alumni
are also actively sought by
the school.

All ‘of these groups show
generally lower academic
qualifications than other ap
plicants, according to mem-
bers of the administration.

There has been some crit-
icism of the admissions pol-
icy on blacks. Last week
THE DAVIDSONIAN receiv-

wed a letter which asserted

that one particular black ap
plicant had been rejected
for dubious reasons.

Asked to comment on this
case, White said: “It is the
committee policy and it is
a part of my _ professional
ethics not to discuss the de
tails of any particular ap-
plication. One obvious reason
for this .is that recommend-
ations are given to us in con-
fidence, and the decision

addition, -

must be treated that way.”

He added, “The decision
on the applicant specifically
referred to by letter was
made by the full admissions
committee.”
