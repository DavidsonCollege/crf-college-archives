The Davidsonian

April 22, 1977

By JAKE DARBY

_ “The Madwoman of Chaillot’’,
premiering on April 27, is a tre-
mendeus change from the American
plays that have been presented at
Davidson in the past year. _

The author, Jean Giraudowx, a
diplomat by profession, was a mem-
ber of the French ministry of foreign
affairs. He studied in Munich and in
America at the beginning of the
twentieth century. Through his trav-
els he became obsessed with the quest
for cultural advancement through the

exchange of ideas between nations,
particularly between France and Ger-
many. When World War I broke out,
he fully pursued his writing hobby
and eventually turned his novels into
plays with the guidance of director
Louis Jouvet. His main impetus for
writing was to express the frustration
he found in his career for settling con-
flicts.

“The Madwoman of Chaillot’”’ is a
chariot for many of Giraudoux’s
sentiments at the time of the German
occupation in France, although he
never wanted to single this event out

as his only theme. He also put into
the play his impressions of the more
universal conflict between the sensi-
tive and the strong.

In the play, Giraudoux portrayed
the world as a conglomeration of two
societies: the eccentrics and the
moneygrubbers. The eccentrics, led
by a madwoman who runs a café,
represents all the old customs and
cultures which make up France. The
moneygrubbers are invaders of the
old customs, who have respect for no
culture except for that of money; they
sacrifice their ideals for profit. The

from equating the eccentrics to the

Wanted to make a more general
statement concerning any conflict
between idealism and profit. Dr.
Barber felt that because of this, the
Madwoman is a timely play for this
period, in which we are constantly
dealing with the rape of our natural
resources as the price of progress for
big businesses, international power
structures bearing down on the small
business, the conquest of the indivi-
dual by the masses.

To quote Jacques Guicharnaud,
“Not only is the spectator meant to
sympathize with the hero, he is meant
to identify with his very being in the
universality of his metaphysical con-
dition. The invention of an imaginary
mask, a special language is meant to
emphasize the hidden meanings by
turning the attention away from the
perceived universe.”
