ATC Seeks To Balance Organizational Budget

(continued from page |)

Cooper criticized the ATC’s deci-
sion-making process. “The whole thing
is really bureacratic,” he said. “Most of
the opposition came from [committee
member] Dean Terry. He didn’t discuss
things with us at all. He made flippant re-
marks throughout the whole meeting. He
didn’t really talk to us one-on-one.”
Cooper praised Ester Kim for her part in
ATC affairs “Ester has been really

great,” he said. -

Not all campus organizations are crit-
ical of ATC allotments. The SGA re-
ceived $5,500, $1,000 less than it re-
quested but $1,000 more than it received
last year. Though the ATC cut a $500 re-
quest to help fund SGA Weekend,. the
SGA “can work within the budget they
gave us,” SGA President John Laughlin
said.

Kuykendall Speaks

(continued from page !)

“But this belief has implications for
everyone else who intends to be engaged
in the enterprise of making a college too.
For you (thé students), Davidson must
not merely be an extension of home or
high school, or a prologue to graduate
school, or life’s calling... This is
Davidson.”

“The excitement will be,” he said,
“in trying to discover precisely what this
Davidson is supposed to be and be-
come.”

Kuykendall said he would avoid the
basic error of “the comfortable illusion
that where I am is where I have been in
the past.”

“I am left — at least until July 1 — in
a state which feels very much like a vac-
uum. I watch, I listen, I read, I ponder —
but the impressions are mediated rather
than immediate.”

He asked for tolerance of his answers
of “I don’t know,” and the “Dutchman’s
shrug,” which-he might give in response
to specific questions about Davidson.

Two students asked questions about
racial and religous minorities on campus.

Kuykendall said the College could be
more aggressive in attaining its goals to
improve racial relations on campus, and
pointed out that some of the goals of
“Project °87,” proposed by the Black
Student Coalition, would be difficult to
achieve. He said his experience in the
study of religons and in the Presbyterian
Church would help him deal with prob-
lems with religous minorities on campus.

Kuykedall attended a reception after-
wards, and visited The Davidsonian of-
fices.

Kuykendall will take office July 1.

“I’m happy with what we got,” said
Amnesty International President Hunter
Monroe of AI’s $600 allotment, $200
less than requested but $200 more than
last year. “We weren’t happy at all last
year.” Monroe said last year’s appropri-
ation forced AI “to cut back on our most
expensive thing, our speakers.”

Kim is in the process of notifying
campus organizations of their allot-
ments. The SGA will then vote on the ap-
propriations at next Tuesday’s meeting.
Though some organizations are consid-
ering presenting their cases against the
allotments at the SGA meeting, Kim said

that another presentation would probably
have “‘little-effect” on the SGA vote. The
reason for this, she said, was that several
SGA members are also on the ATC.

The nine-person council includes
SGA Vice-president Beadsie Woo and
Senator Mark Sandy, Business Manager
Robert Currie, Will Terry, Union Direc-
tor William Brown, Kim, and three at-
large represenitives, Thomas Evans,
Stuart Gordon, and Rod Holman. Kim
does not view the presence of SGA mem-
bers on the ATC as a conflict of interests.
“We try to be as objective as possible,”
she said.
