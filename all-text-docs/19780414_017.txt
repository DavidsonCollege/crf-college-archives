Gridders play tough

By MIKE BRITT
Asst. Sports Editor

For the second week in a row
the Davidson Club Football
Team displayed an impenetr-
able defense, shutting out a
strong Robbins Community
team 12-0 Sunday afternoon on
the practice football field. The
previous Sunday coach Ron
Rosenburg took his gridders to
Winston-Salem where they
downed a scrappy team from
Wake Forest 6-0. Here, too, the
defense shone.

In two contests this spring,
the ClubCats have held their
opponents to a total of less than
50 yards rushing and 30 yards
passing. They have allowed
only two first downs per con-
test, have intercepted 5 passes,
and have caused 6 fumbles.

The defensive line has been
anchored this spring by ‘Bad
Bear’’ Sachtjen at the nose-
guard position while Cortez
Cooper has performed well in
the secondary. Sachtjen has
amassed two sacks and a fum-
ble recovery while Cooper leads
the team with two intercep-

tions.

Offensively, rookie quarter-
back Dave ‘‘Calcagni’’ Thomas
has been a real bright spot. He
has passed for one touchdown
and rushed for another. Fooling
the entire Wake defense, he
scored the only points of the
game in the Clubbers’ first
contest by calling a bootleg play
and virtually walking into the
end zone.

The running game has also
shown potential with Rosen-
burg, Rick Bateman, and Russ
Folger ‘sharing time in the
backfield. Rosenburg leads the
team with 97 yards on the
ground. Bateman,though, has
averaged 6.4 yards per carry.

The ClubCats next game will
be this Sunday against Western
Carolina on the practice football
field.

Golf team lacks consistency

By MIKE KENNEDY
Staff Writer

Last week, the golfers travel-
led up to Marshall University
for their annual invitational golf
tournament. This tournament,
called the Collegiate Masters by
some, sported an incredible
banquet, a notable speaker by
the name of Bill Campbell, and
an impressive field to match,
including second ranked Ohio
State (whose alumni include
Jack Nicklaus and Tom Weis-
kopf), who eventually won the
event.

Ignited by a sparkling 72 by

Sollie Foy, Davidson started

the event well. But in keeping
with the team’s lack of consis-
tency, the Cats fell to 13th
place, remaining ahead of the
University of West Virginia.

This past week, the Wildcat
baseball team lost six consecu-
tive games, dropping their ov-
erall record to 10-15. The losing
streak started as the Cats
embarked on a busy week of
away games, playing six of
seven games on the road.

The Cats started the streak in
a closely-fought 3-1 loss at
Wake Forest, but in spite of the
defeat, the Cats showed some
signs of brilliance.

Stan Brown got three hits in
four times at bat, while John
Porter hit two for three. Al-
though the Cat defense made
only two errors in the nine-in-
ning game and senior Tim
Purcell held the Deacons to only
one run in the first six innings,
the Deacons pounded four hits
in the final two innings to win
the game.

The Cats also lost a close 1-0
defensive battle at Lynchburg.
The team was shut-out even
though they had the bases
loaded twice during the game.
Brilliant defensive play was
exhibited by centerfielder
Brown, who threw out two
Lynchburg runners at the plate.

‘The long week of games on
the road took its toll as the
Cats were disgraced in a 21-0
loss in the first game of a
double-header with Madison.
However, in the second game,
the Cats fought back, losing
10-7 in a more closely matched
hitting contest.

The worst part of the losing
streak for the Cats came in the

two losses at home to Southern ©

Conference leader Appalachian
State. In the first game, the
Cats played well in all'but one
inning, where ASU scored eight
runs that led to the 9-5 defeat of
the Cats. In the second game,
the Cats fell behind in the early
innings, but fought back to an

334 S: Academy St.
Mooresville, NC.

3 round total of 232; Scott
Gilmore followed with 234 and
L.D. Simmons next with 238.
Bringing up the second half
were Jim Heard’s 244, Mark
Polhill’s 245 and Bill Baird’s
247.

This week the team "played in
Charlotte in the sixth annual
North Carolina Golf Champion-
ship at Raintree Country Club.
The Cats entered this tourney
expecting a good finish, for this
UNCC hosted event had a less
notable field than in the team’s
earlier encounters. The Cats
once again, however, never
quite managed to put it in the
hole and fared a mediocre eighth
of 15, a finish similar to the
previous two years.

Sollie Foy was once again the
team leader with a consistantly
strong 75-76: 151. L.D. Sim-

8-10 score going into the sev-
enth inning.

In their final time at bat, the
Cats loaded the bases with only
one out, but were unable to
bring in the runs needed to win
the game. These losses to ASU
give the Cats a 3°38 Conference
record. However, the Cats still
have a glimmer of hope at
winning the Conference since
both The Citadel and Furman
have three losses. "ASU is now
6-0 while Marshall is 5-1.

The one bright spot in the
Cats’ week was the impressive
19-4 victory at home over
Catawba, which snapped the
Cat losing streak. Freshman
pitcher Bill Duke hurled all nine
innings, holding the Catawba
hitters to just four hits with no
earned runs. Duke's record is
now 3-4 and he has a 4.56 ERA.

While Duke stopped the op-
posing batters, the Cat hitters
pounded the Catawba pitchers
for sixteen hits, forcing Cataw-
ba to use four different pitchers
in the nine inning game. Right-

mons, trying to rebound from
what has been, thus far, a
dismal season, fired a 78-79: 157
for second place honors on the
team. Jim Heard and Joe Davis
both had 159, Scott Gilmore's
164 and Bill Baird’s disappoint-
ing 165 rounded out the scores.

The climax of the season
comes next week when the Cats
travel to Florence, South Caro-
lina for play in the Southern
Conference Championship.
Marshall appears to be an odds
on favorite for the champion-
ship, and Davidson will have to
put on their best performance of
the year to be incontention. The
team is still very optimistic
about their chances. When L.D.
Simmons was asked about the
coming event, he responded ‘'I
really feel the team will peak
about then. We’ll have to. I
know I’m up for it.”

fielder Tim McDowell stood out
among the Cat hitters, going
four for~six at the plate,
including three doubles and one
homerun. McDowell now touts
a strong .360 batting average.
Catcher Bob Lapple who is
batting .322, also had a good
day at the plate, smashing three
doubles in five times at bat.

Another bright spot for the
Cats this week was that Jim
Richards moved his stolen base
record to 15, which breaks the
old Davidson record for stolen
bases. The old record was
thirteen stolen bases, set by
Tim McDowell last year in a
forty-game season. The fleet-
footed Richards has already
broken the old record in a mere
nineteen games.

Since the long road trip is
over, the Cats hope to continue
breaking out of the slump which
last week's travelling brought
upon them. The Cats need to
play well, since they play
Conference contender Furman
