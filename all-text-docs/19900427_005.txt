Questioning the
Honor Code

THERESE GYAUCH '90'

Four years ago, I used to drop
my backpack on Chambers lawn,
leaveit there for several hours un-
attended, and return to find itand
its contents intact. Four years ago,
Ikeptall my textbooks in my carrel
at the library. Four years ago, I
could be confident that if I lost a
book or other belonging some-
where on campus it would be
turned into the Union Lost-and-
Found or the Dean of Students
Office. Not today. I have experi-
enced four thefts of personal be-
longings in the last two years. This
isasad commentary onthe Honor
Code. As a senior, I am disillu-
sioned. What has happened to the
integrity of the Honor Code? Is the
classroom the only arena in which
students think they must apply
the Honor Code?

Ibelieve that I am not the only
person asking these questions.
Think about the number of signs
you have seen this year in the col-
lege laundry asking people to re-
turn:clothes that do not belong to
them. (Certainly mistakes occurin
clothes pick-up, but not as many
as I think are evidenced by the
signs.) Whataboutthe clothes that
seem tO disappear from the-stu-
dent laundry room in Watts, too?

Can ‘you namie friends and ‘class-*

mates’ whose ‘books have ‘been
stolén? I'know ‘three individuals
whocollectively have had over one
hundred dollars of textbooks sto-

I have experienced
four thefts of personal
belonging the last two
years. This is a sad
commentary on the
Honor Code.

len. Ask yourself why there seem
to be so many more signs in the
library than there were four years
ago which remind students that it
isan Honor Code violation to take
books out of the library without
checking them out. ;
There are those who will ar-
gue that part of the problem is the
presence of more outsiders on the
campus. Thecollege and commu-
nity do interface, and we cannot
control visitors’ behavior. Still, we
mustnotallow this fact to deter us
from examining issues related to
the Honor Code. In agreeing to
attend Davidson College, students
agreed toabideby the HonorCode.
If this is not true, then why does
‘our admissions office require ev-
eryapplicant toexamineand write

_ about our Honor Code as part of

the application process? Many so-
lutionsto problems with the Honor
Code depend directly on students
and faculty. They must decide to
present the Honor Code as a cor-
nerstone of Davidson life.

I believe that the Honor Code
still worksinthe classroom. Ihope
that I am not being naive. Person-
ally, I have had no experiences
which demonstrate that the integ-
rity of the Honor Code there has

collapsed. Still, | am concerned.
The other day I heard a fifth-year
senior mention that he had begun
to hear about some professors
choosing to proctor their reviews.
Rumor? Perhaps. Is faculty’s trust
waning? Is somebody suggesting
that there are now reasons to
wonder about how seriously stu-
dents treat the Honor Code?

Onacouple of occasions when
I have simply forgotten to sign a
pledge on assignments because |
was hurried, it has bothered me
thatnocommentor follow-up was
initiated. Granted, I simply forgot
because of my haste to turn in an
assignment. Butsuppose that] had
been trying to signal a professor
that I needed todiscuss a violation
(my own or someone else's) but
was scared to come forward? Un-
less the use of a pledgeis practiced
uniformly, does it really signify
much?

In some classes, students are
not required to write out’ the full
honor pledge on tests and assign-
ments. Should this be the case?
Four years ago, I would have ar-
gued, “No!” Today, I think writing
“pledged” on work is insufficient.
Students need to be reminded fre-
quently of the full meaning and
impact of the Honor Code. Asking
students to write it on every as-
signment reinforces that Davidson
‘College stands firm inits commit-

“ “Like myself, Dr. John William-
“son (chairman of the biology de-
partment) expresses his concern
that students are taking the Honor
Code for granted thésedays. When
asked ‘to sign the full pledge to
reviews this spring, many students
could not write it. What does this
say about our students? Doesitsay
that there is a lack of emphasis on
and a lack visibility of the Honor
Code? We must seek answers to
these questions now.
Finally, let me suggest that we
also need to consider the Code of

In Defense of the "Little Things"

I grew upin Pittsburgh during
the years when the Steelers were
winning Super Bowls. Iremember
very distinctly walking into my
fifth-grade classroom on the day
after the Steelers had won the 1978
Super Bowland seeing a boy inmy
class named Kevindancing around
the room chanting “The Steelers
are Great! Yeah! The Steelers are
Great! Yeah!” He bounced over to
akid named Jimmy and said, “The
Steelers are Great” as a prompt for
Jimmy to say “Yeah!”

But instead, Jimmy said “I
guess so; I didn’t watch the game.”
The look of complete and utter
horror on Kevin’s face at that
moment is something I will never
forget. He was speechless. Finally
he recovered from the shock
enough to exclaim, “How could
you not watch the Steelers win the
Super Bowl!” Hearing this, the
entire class turned around to stare
at Jimmy as if they had just found
out that he had been selling our
country’s defense secrets to the
Russians.

At this point I was getting a
little nervous because I had not
watched the game either. I had the
feeling that there must be some-
thing inherently wrong with me
that would cause me to commit
such a heinous sin.

Looking back, I guess I
shouldn‘tbesurprised at the depth
to Which the Steeler-love attitude
had been ‘instilled in Kevin. At

“school we'd had “black ‘and'gold
-hfririt' to“ keep morality’and hard’

“ dénits’ minds: yy

days” in which all the kids would

° deck themselVes outin theSteeler’s

colors: Welearried the Steeler Fight
song (sung to the tune of the Penn-

~'sylvania Polka) in music class.

There were billboards around the
city praising the Steelers. People

-talked about the SteelersontheTV

news and the radio. Discussions
about the Steelers popped up fre-
quently in conversation. People
were known tosell theircars tobuy
tickets to go to the game.

Kevin's room was plastered
from floor toceiling with posters of
Mean Joe Greene and friends. His
mother had bought him a Steelers
bedspread, lampshade, and waste-

and then have them reinforced, by
our culture’s nudging us repeat-
edly, innumerous ways, through-
outour lives. A little thing, suchas
being taught the Steeler fight song
in music class, will not transform
ourvalues, butincombination with
all the other little things it will
cumulatively change our attitudes
about how valuable football is.

Kevin would have said that
loving football is normal. But a
Spaniard would say thesameabout
loving bullfights, an ancient Greek
about loving javelin throwing, a
Balinese about loving cockfights.
All of these loves are determined
by culture.

lam not writing about Jimmy
and Kevin merely to amuse you
withcharming anecdotes from my
childhood. Iam writingabout them
because there have been many
times, in the past four years espe-
cially, that I have felt like Jimmy
did when he did not endorse the
values of the Steeler culture.

I don’t see anything wrong
with being a Steelers fan. Itis one
of the more harmless instances of
cultural coriditioning. But it is a
result Of cultural conditioning, as
are many of the attitudes we hold.
In order to evaluate our attitudes,
we must first examine where they
come from. What reinforces them
throughout our lives?

If we, like Kevin, merely ab-
sorb the conditioning without

‘being aware of what it is doing to

uS,'theh will be extremely difficult
fot us to break out of this mindset
‘long enough to see what the mind-,

‘setconsists of and torecognize that
we have developed it from a com-

Sexism results from
innumerable forces

which act on us the

Steeler forces acted on

isan extension of the Honor Code,
a further attempt to emphasize
honesty and accountability in stu-
dent lifestyles. “Borrowing” of

not happen. Think. Does any of
this activity demonstrate mature,
trustworthy behavior? Is good

community encouraged by it? Who .

benefits by destroying property
and showing disrespect to others?

An Honor Code which ex-
tended throughout all campus life
drew me to Davidson College.
Today I believe its integrity is
endangered. Now is the time to
reexamine ourselves as individu-
als and as a community, or this
college will loseanelementof itself
that has always distinguished it
from other institutions.

basket, His father taught him to
play football in the backyard from
the time he was a toddler, and had
taken him to see football games
even before that.
Peoplecommonly equated the
Steeler’s winning a game with the
demonstration of Pittsburghers
superiority over the rest of human-
ity. Such virtues as courage, dedi-
cation, hard work, heroism, and
even family loyalty (for some rea-
son “We are fam-a-lee,” as in the
Pointer Sisters song, became a
popular pro-Steeler chant) all
found their ultimate expression o:
the football field.
And because we were all so

used to this fascination with foot-

ball in general and the Steelers in
particular,noonereally questioned
where the attitudes came from.
Nobody said “Hey, wait a minute,

what are the reasons we value’

football?”

Valuing athletic prowess is an
example of how we absorb atti-
tudes and values from ourculture,

attitudesare notisolated incidents.

‘Sexist attitudes contribute to
women’s losing their self-respect,
to women bearing the brunt of
poverty, to women’s over-depend-
ence on men, to wife-beating, to
women being under-valued, to
women’s depression, to women
being humiliated, to rape, to
women working in menial jobs, to
anorexia, to women being op-
pressed systematically and repeat-
edly. These incidents are the inevi-
table result of societal trends which
prevent women from being val-
ued, dehumanize women, and
restrict women to narrow roles.

We will notbe able to get rid of
these incidents until we get rid of
their causes. Getting rid of the
causes is problematic, however,
because their causes are abstract
attitudes. But I can’t fight against
abstract attitudes; I can only fight
against specific reinforcements of
those abstract values. So I find
things such as gender-exclusive
language or evaluating women’s
worth based on their appearance
orstatements that wedon’tneed to
study women’s history because
women haven't done much that’s

fimportant. And I try tofightagainst
these specific things.

But often other students say,
“Oh, those are just little things,
they don’t matter.” Many of them
are little things, but they do matter
because their cumulative effect is
reinforcing the abstract values; just

_ as my music class being taught the
Steeler fight song was a little thing
that ‘was one of many little things
which cumulatively reinforced an
attitude that the Steelers were im-
portant. rf

Often, students can’t. under-
stand whyall theangerl feel against
all these forms of women’s oppres-
sion is directed at them just for
hanging upa poster of a womanin
a bikini, “It’s just a poster,” they
say. “Don’t take it so seriously. It
doesn’t make men go out and
commit rapes.” Butit,likesomany
other repeated “little things,” helps
cause the attitudes that help cause
rape, and so the end result is the
same, onlyitis much moredifficult

bination of outside sources, that it
is not natural. And if we do not
question our ownconditioning we
too will be capable of nothing but
anuncomprehending stareatany-
one who does not wholeheartedly
embrace our values or our percep-
tions.

With football, the results of this
blind acceptance are seldom dam-

“aging. If, on the other hand, we

blindly accept all the attitudes
society imposes usin matters such
as sexism, the results can be ex-
tremely destructive.

Sexism results from innumer-
able forces whichacton usinmuch
the same way pro-Steeler forces
acted on Kevin. These forces in-
clude school, the media, parents,
music, and associations with high
principles.

Kevin's becoming a die-hard
Steeler fanatic was not an isolated

- incident; it was the predictable

result of a lifetime of societal con-
ditioning. In the same way, the
situations that result from sexist

to recognize.

My frustrationisintensified by

living among students who donot
question the sexist values because
they are “normal.” We are all ac-
customed to them. Wehave grown
up with them from the time we
were given baby dolls if we were
girls and Tonka trucks if we were
boys. I feel like saying, “No! It’s all
wrong! Our entire mentality is all
wrong and we've got to do some-
thing to fix it!”
_ But until we start challenging
both thesexist attitudes that we've
grown up with and all the “little
things” that consistently and cu-
mulatively reinforce them, the big
things won't change.

If I have focused too much of
my anger about attitudes on par-
ticular situations, that was not my
intent. But I’m asking you to try to
understand where thisanger comes
from, totry to beaware of the “little
things” that bring about the atti-
tudes that hurt women, and to
make some effort to change them.
