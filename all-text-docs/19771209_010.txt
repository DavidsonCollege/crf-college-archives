Christmas comes

in poetry reading

By AMANDA HALL
Managing Editor

North Carolina poets Cal Atwood
and Margaret Booth believe the great
literature of Christmas should be read
aloud. Singer Laura Bennet, on
guitar, dulcimer and mandolin, is
ready to bring old and new carols to
life.

The three performers, calling them-
selves the Traveling Troubadours,
will make a special appearance in the

900 Room of the College Union at 4:00

Sunday December 11 to present “A
Christmas Wassail,’’ a unique Christ-
mas readers theatre including both
literature and music.

The group -will examine the mea-
ning of Christmas through prose and
poetry ranging from a sixteenth

century Christmas greeting and ex-
erpts from Charles Dickens’ A Christ-
mas Carol to works by such modern
writers as Dylan Thomas And Louis
Untermeyer.

Bennet will accompany the presen-
tation with some of the most beautiful
carols chosen especially for their
lyrics.

The Traveling Troubadours will
focus of five major themes in their
production: the symbols of Christ-
mas, both religious and not, cynicism
about the holiday, the origin of and
continuation of the tradition of gift
giving, Bethlehem and, in the final
four poems, the meaning of Christmas
to Modern Man.

Hosted by the Poetry Committee of
the College Union, ‘‘A Christmas
Wassail”’ will last approximately 60
minutes and is free to students and
the public.

Know your library, °

By ANN SHAEFFER
Staff Writer

Dr. Mary Beatty is the reference
coordinator and associate director of
E.H. Little Library. She is personable
and enjoys working with both stu-
dents and faculty.

Dr. Beatty is a native of Davidson.
She attended Agnes Scott College for

her undergraduate work and went on

to receive her Ph.D. in Classics from
the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.

She was hired by Westhampton,
the female counterpart of the Univer-
sity of Richmond, where she taught
Latin and served as head of the
ancient language department.

In 1973 Dr: Beatty decided to
return to Davidson, and accepted the
post of reference coordinator.

Her position is a new one, created
as part of a five-year program to
expand reference service, and funded
partly by the College and partly by a
grant from the National Endowment
for the Humanities and the Council on
Library Resources.

Dr. Beatty’s job entails not only
preparing handouts and helping with
individual projects, but close coopera-
tion with classes as a whole:

Last year alone she visited ove;
forty classes, explaining the available
resources pertinent to that particular
class’ assignment. She is especially
interested in aquainting the freshmen
with the resource materials available
in the library.

For example, there are specific
reference manuals for sciences, lan-

Grades

|. Beatty tells students

guages, etc., besides the general
sources, such as the Readers Guide.

Dr. Beatty believes it is extremely
important that the students have a
working knowledge of the library, and
she spends much of her time showing
students where to find particular
source material.

As assistant director of the library
for the past year, Dr. Beatty has also
been involved in expanding the
library’s resources.

She is working to add to the
library’s collection those books which
she feels will most compliment the
current curriculum.

Also, Davidson has now coordi-
nated its resources with those of the
libraries at Duke, Chapel Hill, and
North Carolina State at Raleigh, thus
making available sources which Da-
vidson could not otherwise have easy
access to.

In her spare time, Dr. Beatty
enjoys reading and gardening, but
most of her time is spent in job-rela-
ted work. She is particularly interes-
ted in the field of biliographic control,
which explains how knowledge is
organized within a particular field.

The reason for her dedication can
perhaps by explained by her deep
commitment to the idea that every
student shoyld be able to maximize
his research efforts while at David-
son.

Also, her job allows her to maintain
the academic side of her career while
maintaining a type of non-academic
contact with the students which
cannot be found as easily in a
student-teacher relationship.

It’s hard going

What does the 1979 crop of freshmen
think about the workload at David-
son?

Even in the cold of winter weather,
any freshman is bound to get heated
up over a discussion of grades.

Not everyone agrees, as a random
and totally unscientific sample of
opinion revealed.

“Too much,”’ “enough to kill you”’
and “‘incredible’’ were typical labels
given to the difficulty of the courses
at Davidson.

One astute student, when asked
how hard his courses were, refuses on
the grounds that ‘I’ve been working
so hard my mind isn’t fun
properly anymore...’

‘PT S65 mans ‘Yat psec alae

end of the quarter’’ remarked one
student.

‘Others questioned the eal educa-
tional value of a high workload.

“They try to condense too much
material into such a short period of
time that you can’t absorb the
fundamentals of the subject,” they
said.

Of course, there is a minority view
on everything. One freshman claimed
that there was not’ enough work to do
at Davidson. ‘They ought to assign
more between Thanksgiving and the
Christmas break.”

It is to be pointed out that this
speaker kept his fingers crossed
throughout his entire statement.

One final statement seemed to
