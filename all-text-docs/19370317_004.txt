SPOTLIGHT SHINES ON
SPRING SPORTS

> YATES EAISON
CAT-NIPS

As the final blast of Coach Me-
Ever’s whistle echoed over Richard-
son Field last Saturday afternoon,
about forty weary trudged
from the field and trooped into the
dressing room. Half of this num-
ber were gay, but tired; the others
were just tired. The had
beaten their arch-rivals, the Grays,
in a game as dear to each as the
traditional Wake Forest game is to
the combined forces,

The Red team was far superior
on paper to its rival eleven—but
only on paper. The Grays resented
from the first, the superior attitude
taken toward them. They wanted
to make it hot for their foes — and

boys

Reds

they did.
After the Reds won the _ first
game, there followed a_ scoreless

tie, and two wins for these under-
dog Grays. This is the Grays’ count
—the Red said the count was tied.
All depended on the final game!

The game is described elsewhere
on this page, but space is too limited
to describe this great battle.

Grays Fight

The Reds boasted such names as
Teeny Lafferty, Bailey Williams,
Dave Warden, Fred Dennis, Bob
Abell, and others, but Frank Har-
rison, Chubby King, Tubby Hand,
George Richmond, John Sadler and
the rest-of the Grays paid no at-
tention to names. They gave Laff-
erty and Williams and Co. a tough
time of it.

Fall Prospects

Spring practice may appear only
an out-of-season series of practice,
but people who know will tell you
football teams are made in the
spring, not in the fall. Of course,
we will miss Dick Johnston, John
Lee, Ed Armfield and Tom Corbin,
but when autumn rolls around the
Wildcats will be just ahotit as
strong as this year if not stronger.

Baseball is now nearing the open-
ing of its Pitchers
been limbering up—“‘warming the
ole soupbone”’ — for about two
weeks, and, as soon as the weather
pertnits, they will start their spring
task of trying to throw the balls by
the batters.

bd Baseball Slants

Prospects point to a strong de-
fensive team, while the hitting re-
mains a question-mark. From out-
ward appearances it appears the
starting line-up includes: first base
—Swede Johnston; second base—
Okie Bank; shortstop—Bill Quick;
third base—Asbury Howard; out-
field—Teeny Lafferty, Jim Dick-
son and Fielding Clark. The bat-
tery will be made up of either J.
D. Hicks or Herman Yearwood and
a toss-up for catcher between Joe
Kellam and Doug Neal.

Track Meet

The inter-fraternity track meet
this week should be an interesting
affair. Last year this event was
sponsored by the intra-mural de-
partment for the first time. This
is one of the best ways the track
coaches can get a line on freshman
prospects and some hitherto un-
known upper-classmen are often
discovered by Coach Whittle. Some
of the longer distance events are
cut down to take into consideration
the lack of proper conditioning of
the contestants.

“D” Club Change

Little notice has been given to
the change, but the “D” Club has
made a splendid change in its ini-
tiation. Formerly the men who rep-

season, have

resented Davidson on the athletic

field were forced to undergo the
ridicule and jeering of the under-
classmen (especially freshmen) :
This was no proper reward! Now
they will be recognized in a cere-
mony more fit for the occasion,
with the distructive public horse-
play omitted.
Golf Tourney

While all other sports are going
froward, why not have a campus
wide golf tournament? «It seems
everyone is taking more and more
to the old Scotch game, so the in-
terest should be high. Then let the
eight men in the quarter finals
compose a team to meet an eight-

TO FORM SECOND TEAM
Challenge Matches To Be Held

This Week
The 1937 Davidson golf team is
rapidly rounding into form with
Charlie Ross, Bill Snow, Hinson

Maples, and Jimmy Westall leading
the contenders at present for: four
respective positions. Captain Ralph
McClelland and Raymond Pittman
hold fifth and sixth berths.

Play to decide who would com-
pose the team took place over the
Carolina thks in Charlotte last
week. Jimmy Westall pulled the
biggest surprise in nosing out Cap-
tain McClelland for fourth place.
Challenge rounds this week may
alter the present standings however.
Other active threats are Hoke Rob-
inson, Yates Faison, Stuart Barnes,
Jack Tillotson, Tom Mullen, and
Tom Henderson. Players ranking
five through eight will compose a
“B" team the number five man al-
ternating with the varsity four.

The Wildcats take on Hampden-
Sydney in their initial engagement
Tuesday on the Carolina course
in Charlotte. Matches with Catawba
and Richmond to played next
week were unexpectedly cancelled.

The men are now in hard train-
ing to better last record
which was the best in years. Only
one letterman was Jost and so the
‘Cats have an excellent opportunity
to come through with another good
season. Following their match with
Hampden-Sydney the golfers entrip
for Tennessee, Georgia and points
south to face some of the best quar-
tets in the east during the spring

be

season's

holidays.

The tentative schedule for the
season is as follows: March 1 to 13
—varsity tryouts, 72 holes of medal
play; March 23—Hampden-Sydney
College in Charlotte at 2:00; March
26—University of Tenn. in Knox-
ville; March 27—Vanderbilt; March
20—Georgia Tech; March 30—Jun-
ior College of Augusta; March 31
—U. of Georgia in Athens; April 1
—Emory U. there; dates undecided,
but in April: N. C. State; Texas,

and Southern Intercollegiate in
Athens; April 29—N. C. State in
Raleigh; April 30—State Tourna-
ment in Raleigh; May 1—Carolina
there; May 4—The Citadel in Char-
lotte; May 7—Tin Whistles Coun-

Quarter Final Matches of Var-
sity Tourney to Be Played
Off Soon

Captain Carl Carlson and Bron-
ston Kenney, seeded one and two
respectively, stroked their way into
the quarter final round of the var-
sity tennis tournament last week

without being extended in their
early round matches. Jimmie Rein-
hardt, Lloyd Fe uchtenberger,

“Bones” Woodward, Harry Framp-
ton, and Wilson Northcross also
made the round of eight, while the
remaining berth will be filled by
the winner of the Wade Boggs-Ed
Cloyd match. i

The only major upset of the

tournament was the defeat of Perry
Sloan, seeded number five, by Lloyd
Feuchtenberger in a gruelling three
set match. After each man had
captured an 8-6 set, Feuchtenberg-
er showed his stamina by coming
back to annex the deciding set 6-1.
Sloan conquered Lloyd in the fall
tournament ‘but was unable to re-
peat Friday.
Wilson Northcross definitely es-
tablished himself as a tournament
threat by trouncing George Jones
6-2, 6-2, in one of the best played
matches thus far. Both men were
considered good ‘varsity material,
but the smooth stroking and steady
playing of Northcross against his
freshman team-mate of last year
established him as the dark horse
of the tournament,

“Bones” Woodward and Jimmie
Reinhardt annexed easy victories

cross, and Feuchtenberger vs. the
winner of the Boggs-Cloyd match.

will be played the last of this week.

Eight Yearlings Try Out For
Links Team

Prospective members of the Wild-
kitten golf team are swinging away
on Davidson's links, preparing to
put up a hard fight for the
places on the team.

Several freshmen responded to a
call for prospective members issued
at chapel last Friday. The team will
finance its own trips this year,
Frosh numerals will be awarded to
four members,

Beginning on April 5th, there will
be a 36 hole medal tournament to
determine the four members of the
team. Prospects look good as the
candidates prepare for this tourna-
ment.

One match with Oak Ridge has
already been for the
team. They also hope to arrange
for matches with Salisbury, Win-
ston-Salem, and Greensboro high
schools. Charlie Ross, one of the
varsity lettermen, has charge of
the frosh this year. The eight men
who have already come out for the
team are Bill Burch, George Coates,

Many Veterans Return; New-
comers Wage Fight For
Positions

The Wildcat baseball team is com-
ing along nicely and will probably
be better than last year’s, accord-
ing to Coach Flake Laird.

There are several candidates for
nearly every position and some
hot fights will be waged before the
Starting lineup for the first game
is announced.

The catching post will be well
taken care of by Joe Kellam and
Doug Neal, veterans of last season.
Herman Yearwood is the only let-
terman on the pitching staff, but
will be reinforced by J. D. Hicks
and Parker Connor from last year’s
frosh nine, Fielding Clark, convert-
ed outfielder who looks like a
prospective hurler, John Armstrong
and Charlie Parker. At first base
Swede _ Johnson has been looking
good, but Coach Laird is planning
to give Teeny Lafferty, veteran cen-
terfielder, a trial here. At second
base Shorty Bankhead and ‘Sam
Hemphill are the leading candidates.
Bankhead was a regular last year,
while Hemphill was a star on the
frosh team. Captain Bill Quick,
Eddie Steere, and Elwood Moyer
are on the inside track for the
shortstop position. Asbury Howard
seems to have things pretty much
his own way at third base. Last
year’s regular outfield is back again
composed of Fielding Clark, Teeny
Lafferty, and Jim Dickson, but
Laird is giving Clark a trial on the
mound and Lafferty a shot at first
base. If they come through at these
positions their shoes will be filled
by Parks Hand, John Rudisill, Dick
lindsey, Jim Terry or John Irwin.
The team looks strong defensively
and Coach Laird is now searching
for some power at the plate. Eddie
Steere has been hitting nicely and
if he keeps it up will be shifted
to the outfield. The team will be
well balanced with regard to left
and right handed hitters.+ Those
who swing from the port side are

COUNT EVEN AT HALF

Coach McEver Announces
Football Clinic to Be Held
Twice Weekly

The Red team of the Davidson
spring football squad defeated the
Greys in a thrilling game Saturday
by the score of 18 to 6.

The Reds scored early in the
game when Bill Beaty snagged a
pass from Teeny Lafferty for a
touchdown. Very soon the Greys
came back to rack up their lone
score of the battle. Their six points
came as a,result of a beautiful for-
ward-lateral pass combination. Mc-
Call, center on the Grey team, took
the tail end of the forward-lateral
and was downed on the three yard
line. Little Frank Harrison then
hurdled through the air for the
touchdown to tie the score 6-6.

There was no more scoring by
either team until the third quarter
but the remainder of the first half
featured long runs by Lafferty and
good defensive work by both
teams.

In the last half the Reds over-
powered the strong defense of the
Greys to push over two more
touchdowns. One time the ball was
carried over by Lafferty and then
Dennis plunged through for the fi-
nal score of the conflict. The score
remained at 18-6 until the end of
the game.

The third quarter was notable be-
cause of long driving -gains made
by the Red team, Dennis did some
fine blocking and Lafferty did some
beautiful running behind his good
interference. McCall of the Grey
team was valuable because of the
great number of passes which he
knocked down and intercepted.

No extra points were allowed
during the game. Fine blocking and
