THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 1, 1933

Silver Screen

Wednesday, March 1—The Woman Accused
—(Paramount)

Nancy Carroll has the leading role in this
Liberty-Paramount prize story. The picture
is taken from the story, “The Woman Ac-
cused,” that ran in the Liberty Magazine,
which was composed by ten of the leading
authors of the day. The story was good,
and the picture has the possibilities of be-

ing an interesting cinema. Cary Grant plays}

opposite her in this mystery thriller.

Thursday, March 2—Blondie Johnston—
(Warner)

Joan Blondell, as a new kind of gold-dig-
ger, is a commander of man, but when she
meets the commander of woman, portrayed
by Chester Morris, things happen. Fast
moving with the attractive Joan Blondell at
her best. 2

cee ~~
Friday, March 3—Hello Everybody—(Fox)

The famous Kate Smith, star of the radio,
plays the lead in this story of a girl who
saves her village from “Big Business.”
Sally Blane and Randolph Scott (a Char-
lotte, N. C., boy) supply the romance. It
is the singing of Kate Smith that*makes
the picture worth seeing. The popular mu-
sical hit, “Moon Song,” was taken from
this picture. Wait until you hear Kate sing
it. A dance routine that Kate does will bowl
them over into the aisles.

Saturday, March 4—From Hell to Heaven—
(Paramount)

The beautiful Carole Lombard heads the

cast of this picture. She is ably supported

by Jack Oakie and the good-looking David
Manners. It is the story of people who stake
their souls on sixty seconds. They are peo-
ple in mental torment. Carole Lombard is
good in the race track scene.

Monday, March 6—Child of Manhattan—
(Paramount)

Nancy Carroll, the beautiful baby-faced
redhead, plays the role of a modern Cin-
derella in a dance hall. John Boles is the
striking prince. He marries her, and she

thinks it is only a grand gesture-on~his|—

part. However, it turns out that he really
loves the gal. The situation seems highly
unbelievable at times, but good acting by
Nancy Carroll and John Boles makes it a
good performance. It may be classed as
good entertainment.

Tuesday, March 7—Topaze—(M-G-M)

John Barrymore chose this role above all
others because it was most to his liking. It
is the story of a professor who loses his
job and, innocently enough, becomes en-
tangled with crooks. Learning their motive,
he “outcrooks the crooks.” And not only
that, but won the villain’s girl. The picture
is different. John Barrymore’s acting is as
good as always. Myrna Loy and Gloria
Stuart give him excellent support. The
high comedy of Barrymore makes the pic-
ture delightfully entertaining.

A riot which followed the refusal of stu-
dents at the City College of New York to
accept faculty censorship of The Ticker,
student newspaper, resulted in the suspen-

sion of eleven students.

Davidson Will Be Represented by
Five Varsity and Three
Freshmen

Leading the long procession-of stars to
the spectacular Southern Conference In-
door Games at the University of North .
Carolina March 4 is the flying Earl Wid-
myer of the University of Maryland, who
at—the—Millross_ games_recently outstepped
Wykoff, world’s outdoor record holder.

Widmyer is slated for a briliant race
when he meets Lynn, Clemson’s Southern
|| Conference outdoor champion, and Brown-
lee of Duke, who has also been credited
with 9.8 for the 100-yard dash, and who
is scheduled for still another brilliant duel
with Eli Finkelstein, Washington and Lee
hurdler. Brownlee holds the Conference out-
door low hurdle record and is co-holder of
the indoor record with Finkelstein. This will
be their first meeting and an epochal one
in the indoor games, for Finkelstein was
injured and out of competition last year.

Clarence Jensen of North Carolina and
Captain Billy Lauck”of Virginia are stated
for another fine race. Jensen holds the in-
door mile record, and Lauck is the Confer-
ence outdoor record holder.

Of the other prominent stars who will
participate in the games are: Wellford, Vir-
ginia record holder in the 440-yard dash;
Fulmer, Duke’s. brilliant quarter-miler and
broad jumper, who was a member of last
year’s Conference championship relay team;
and Higby, Carolina’s broad jumper, who
hopes to stop Fulmer.

North Carolina will be the defending
champion in the big: meet, which will also
carry non-conference, freshman and schol-
astic divisions. Every Southern Conference
institution has indicated that it will be rep-
resented. Duke and Virginia look like espe-
cially likely teams to dethrone the Tar
Heels, but Maryland, Washington and Lee
and other teams look: very strong.

Davidson will be represented this year in
both the varsity and freshman events. At
the present time, it appears certain that at
least eight men will be sent to represent
the Wildcats, five of these varsity and three
freshmen. In the 60-yard sprint, Fleagle,
