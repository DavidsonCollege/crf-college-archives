Stolpen initiates Jewish group

Small Jewish population to find unity through JSO affiliation

By Manpy Curtis
Executive Editor

A Shabbat dinner and service
on September 15 at Temple Beth
EL in Charlotte marks the first
activity of the year hosted by the
newly established Jewish Student
Organization.

Senior Roberta Stolpen
founded the organization in an ef-
fort to unite Jewish Students at
Davidson and to provide social
activities with other Jewish stu-
dents at colleges in the area.

With the help of College Chap-
lain Rob Spach and junior DeVere
Kutcher, Stolpen has communi-
cated with Queens, Pfeiffer,
Belmont Abbey, CPCC, Winthrop,
Wingate and JCSU to make this
project possible.

According to Stolpen, the
small Jewish population at

Davidson has made it difficult to
coordinate various activities as a
group.

For this reason, Stolpen con-
tacted other colleges in the area to
arrange for different social engage-
ments centered around different
Jewish holidays and events.

Although the Jewish Student
Organization has scheduled the
activities based on Jewish events,
Stolpen says all students and fac-
ulty are invited to “participate as
religiously or not religiously” as
they choose.

Establishing the organization
and getting four initial social ac-
tivities off the ground have only
been part of the process of recog-
nizing Judaism at Davidson.

In addition, Stolpen has
worked on getting a Davidson
College write-up in theHillel Guide
to Jewish Life on Campus, associ-

ated with the National Jewish Foun-
dation. Like any college guide
book, the Hillel Guide is a guide
for prospective college students
especially interested in organiza-
tions, activities, and other oppor-
tunities available for Jewish stu-
dents. Davidson will appear in the
1996 edition of the Hillel Guide.
While the percentage of Jew-

ish students continues to increase, .

Stolpen hopes the write-up in the
Hillel Guide will give Davidson
the coverage that might encourage
more Jewish students to look at the
college as a possibility.

Other upcoming events spon-
sored by the Jewish Student Orga-
nization will include a Break the
Fast luncheon for Yom Kippur and
a Hanukkah candle-lighting and
party. Stolpen encourages all stu-
dents and faculty members to at-
tend.

Faculty invites changes and
welcomes new professors

By JOANNA JOHNSON
Assistant News Editor

As Davidson welcomes 434
freshmen this year, 15 visiting pro-
fessors and five regular appoint-
ments will also join the college
community.

Clarissa G. Jakob, Assistant
Professor of Chemistry, earned her
B.S. from Presbyterian College,
and her Ph.D. from University of
South Carolina. .

The subject of her graduate
work included protein crystallog-
raphy to determine the structures

of protein molecules to design new
pharmecuticals for cancer. Jakob
decided on Davidson because it
“offered me a unique opportunity
to do two things I really enjoy:
teach and do research at the same
time.”

Mark T. Stanback, Assistant
Professor of Biology, is himself a
Davidson graduate and completed
his Ph.D. at the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley.

Stanback feels that the respon-
sibilities of professors at Davidson
“allow a balance between teaching
and research.” He is especially

and M.D.s was a major student
complaint. But this semester, a phy-
sician will be in the Student Health
Center from 1:30 until 4:30 Mon-
day, Wednesday, and Friday.

Staton points out that this is
important because “a person will
have the opportunity to develop a
relationship with the physicians
we have.” Dr. Edward Campbell,
Dr. William Johanson, and Dr.
Frederick Vorwald of Lake
Norman Family Medical Center
will each work one day a week,
allowing students to see the same
face.

Students will be able to get the
doctor’s diagnosis directly rather
than relying on PA referrals before
seeing students.

Last year’s pool of 10 to 12
physician averaged only 10 to 12
referrals a month, with over 3,000
student visits for the school year.
This extremely low ratio will hope-
fully be improved by the change.
Another student complaint about
lack of female physicians is still an
issue, but female PAs will still be
on duty for the comfort of women
students.

Another major change comes
in new student evaluations that

Staton will conduct in the effort
“to create a tighter feedback loop
to the people we are servicing.”
This again is in response to student
requests, and Staton hopes to “‘in-
crease accountability” for the ac-
tions of Student Health Center staff.

Staton emphasizes that these
changes, while a direct response to
student concerns, are also a result
of an ongoing program already in-
stituted to improve student health
care on campus. A blend of oppor-
tunity and concern helped to create
the current changes.

The college’s contract with
The Davidson Clinic, former con-
tractors of the Student Health Cen-
ter, ran out at the end of the 1994-
1995 school year. “This gave us a
direction,” says Staton. “The stu-
dents spoke, and we. responded,
investigated, and changed.”

The Student Health Center
took bids from different health care
facilities, and eventually reached
the current agreement with Lake
Norman Family Medicine Center.

Staton feels that students are
getting a much improved level of
health care for a lower price. But
he cautions that this is not the end
of improvements to the facility,
and is now filing a report in re-
sponse to the student complaints
brought out last year.

An independent committee
conducted a study which helped to
spark some of the immediate
changes. :

interested in vertebrate field zool-
ogy. For his doctorate, he studied
Eastern Blue Birds, and since then
has focused on Hornbills in Africa
and studied the relationship be-
tween bird reproductive behavior
and hormone work.

Ramon A. Figueroa, Assis-
tant Professor of Spanish, gradu-
ated with a B.S. from the Univer-
sity of Massachusetts, and is com-
pleting his doctorate from the Uni-
versity of Minnesota.

Already having taught at
Davidson as a visiting professor
last year greatly influenced his
decision to return. “The students
here are so great, which was a great
incentive to stay.”

Annie Ingram, Assistant Pro-
fessor of English, was a visiting
professor at Davidson last year and
is now in a tenure track position.
Ingram earned her Bachelor of Arts
degree from Stanford, her Masters
from the Monterey Institute of In-
ternational Studies, and her Ph.D.
from Emory.

Margaret R. McCarthy, As-
sistant Professor of German, earned
her B.A. from Connecticut Col-
lege and is awaiting her Ph.D. from
the University of-Rochester.
