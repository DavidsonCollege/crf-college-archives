DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSO N, N. C., SEPTEMBER 2, 1922.

No. 1.

Salutation

I am glad to extend a hearty welcome
to the college, to old and new students
alike. The college exists for your best
interests. The faculty and the admin-
istration jointly place themselves and
all the resources of the college at your
disposal for the training the college was
founded to give. I hope you will find us
helpful, sympathetic, easy of approach.
The president, as well as every teacher
and officer, counts it a pleasure to coun-
sel with any student over any problem
of interest to the individual. It will, I
am sure, be your own fault, as I'am sure
it will be a mutual loss, if you do not
freely take advantage of the opportu-
nity to go over your problems with your
older friends. I have faith to believe
that the college is manned by men of
such character that they will gladly dis-
cuss with you any matters of a personal,
spiritual or religious nature as well as
matters of material interest. Ours is a
Christian College and designed to give a
Christian training to yield a Christian
service in whatever vocation the student
may choose to cast his life. May you
each one all through the year increase in
wisdom and stature and in the Grace of
God. If you are faithful in duty such ad-
vance will be assured.

WM. J. MARTIN,
President.

FIRST STEPS FOR FRESHMEN

When you get off the train at David-

son a representaive of the “Y” Reception
Committee will speak to you and show
you the way up. First, you go to the
Treasurer’s office where you pay your
fees and deposit 25 cents for your room
key. Then to the Registrar’s office you
go where you fill out certain blanks and
get asigned to classes.
shown up to your room, and after that
you are at home. Any one will direct
you to the different class rooms. Don’t
be afraid to ask reasonable questions
and practice the habit from the first of
speaking to every’ one you meet. The
upper classmen have-a beautiful custom
of “tipping their hats” to the Professors.

Elsewhere you will find a list of board-
ing houses with prices and managers, as
complete as could be obtained. On the
bulletin board will be notices also. You
will have no difficulty in arranging for
your board after you arrive. There will
be a student manager for each boarding
house.

Don’t fail to get into some sort of ex-
_|ercise beginning the first day. This is

admittedly the best prevention of that|.

disease that will get a fellow now and
then—homesickness. Don’t live by your-
self. Don’t go to walk alone: there are
a dozen mén in your class that would
like-to go with you. Be sociable but not
“fresh.” Aspire to make fast friends,
but do not try to make them fast or you
will surely fail. |

If the college is not managed just as
you think it should be remember that
there may be certain viewpoints that

you have not become acquainted with

during your short stay.. Nothing gains
the confidence, respect and good will of
strangers quicker than a happy disposi-
tion and kind expressions.

New Professors

The old students will find three new
faces among the faculty when they re-
turn

ne Pettengill received a call from the
North and left us after a year of service.

We found him a cultured gentleman, well

equipped for his work. We regret to
lose both him and Mrs. Pettengill, and
their two boys.

In German we are fortunate to have
one of Davidson’s honor graduates of
the class of 1910, Rev. Kenneth J. Fore-
man, B.A., of Davidson, M.A., of Prince-
ton University, B.S.T., and ties lass |
Princeton Seminary, ha during the
last year he was engaged in post-grad-
uate studies as a Fellow of the Seminary.
Mr. Foreman expects ultimately to go
into the foreign missionary service.- He
comes back to us well equipped both by
extensive study and by experience as a
teacher. He will, in -addition to the
German, teach two sections of Sopho-
more Bible, which will now be taught in
four sections. This work in the Bible
will be in the New Testament.

In Spanish we will have as assistant
Professor {6 work With Prefecsar
Fleagle, Mr. Augustin V. Goldiere, B.A.
of Dartmout College, and post- gradyate
for two years in Yale. He comes to us
highly recommended and will prove a
great help in a hitherto over- crowded
department. 7

For Public Speaking and Debate, and
to assist in Freshman English; we have
secured Mr. Russell H. Wagner, B.A., of
Monmouth College, Iil., and post-grad-
uate student in Cornell University. Mr.
Wagner has had considerable teaching
experience including the last three years
in Adrian College, Michigan, as teacher
of Public Speaking, Debate and English.
The authorities of both Monmouth and
Adrian Colleges speak in the highest
Mr. Wagner. He will have
two sections of Freshman English, will
have each of the six sections of Fresh-
man English for one hour each week in
Public Speaking, largely a laboratory
course.

Mr. Wagner wil also offer to Juniors and
Seniors and elective three-hour course in
Public Speaking and Debate. Students
who really desire this course will be al-
lowed to adjust the courses as already
selected to make its inclusion possible.
Lt is desired to limit the numbers admit-
ted to this course to 25 or 30. Mr. Wag-
ner wtll have charge of the training of
all men who represent Davidson College .
on the platform either as-orators or de-
baters, whether speaking at Davidson
or away from the college. He will be
deeply interested in the work of the
Literary Societies and will be glad to
help in any way by counsel or service to
secure a greater success in their work.
