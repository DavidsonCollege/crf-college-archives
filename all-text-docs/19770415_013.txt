All-Stars chew Big Red but choke

By BAD BERNARD
and H@&MAN

The IMAC All-Stars led by
Rob Murray, Mike Peskosky,
Adrian Wilson and Dick. My-
rick lost a heartbreaker to the
Big Red Team, 93-89, in the
first annual Bad Bernard-
Hogman Charity game. Tim
Bowker paced the second
stringers with 27 points while
Locke White and Brian Coffey
each added 20.

Twenty-five dollars was
raised for muscular dystrophy
and after discussing the cause
with some of the basketball
coaches, we have decided to
send the money directly to a
poor, sickly youngster in Gray
Georgia by the name of Al

UNNNNHHHHHH!!!!

Wood. No telling what it
might do for him.

The game was _ highly
mediocre until late in the
contest when the flashy Mike
Knowles stole the show.
Decked out in white Chucks
with no socks, the lanky junior
almost won the game for'the
All-Stars. Unfortunately, he
was playing for the Red Team.
Danny Hock, Carter Todd,
and White combined for 18
fouls in just 23 attempts and
set a new record for fouls in
charity competition. Eat your
heart out Guiness Book of
World Records.

It has been a most exciting
week in the world of IMAC
softball. Still the big news is

Runners take 11th

By DAVID HULL
Staff Writer

The Davidson track team
finished 11th in the 18th
annual Davidson Relays, but
outstanding individual per-
formances were turned in by
Jarry Taylor and Carl Mc-
Phail.

Taylor won the hammer
throw with a toss of 135’2”’. It
was the second straight year
that he has won the event.

McPhail captured the 400
meter intermediate hurdles
with a time of :55.24. As a
result of this year’s addition of
several new events measured
in meters, this was a new
record for the event.

The Relays were won by
Pembroke with a score of 75,
followed closely by Appala-
chian and Carson-Newman.
Davidson scored 20 points to
place in the middle of the
pack.

Coach Sterling Martin com-
mented on the annual meet: ‘‘I
felt the event itself was the
biggest and best yet. There
were 27 teams and a total of
550 individual competitors.

“The quality of the competi-
tion was extremely high (eight
new records were set for the
event) due to the addition of
such teams as Duke, Pem-
broke, and Indiana (Pa.).”’

Martin felt the Davidson
team, as a whole, did well but
the competition was extremely
stiff which prevented the
Wildcats.from scoring more
than 20 points.

In the women’s competi-
tion, Nora McNeill won the
100 meter dash (:13.47), Berk-
ley Mann placed second in the
high jump (4’9’’), and Kathy
Wilson finished second in the
long jump (14’4’’).

The lady Wildcats placed
second in {R€competition with
53 points. Duke captured first
with 88 points.

Davidson’s next meet is
with the Citadel on Saturday,
April 16 in Charleston, S.C.
Coach Martin feels this will be
an extremely tough meet and
strong individual perfor-
mances will have to~be relied
upon heavily.

that no one on campus has &
been able to beat Off Again.
The young men from Off
Again, led by Gary Barnes’
home run, which has still not sas
landed, and the Phantom four- #
man, won their sixteenth }
straight consecutive game in a
row without a loss.

The Cannonballs, last
week's #5 team, nipped Rock
and Roll Sunoco, 11,7, and @§
then two days later lost their ©
first game of the season to the
up and coming Jungle Queen.
The Queenies have a human

In women’s. softball it
appears that we will have no
winner this year since all the q
teams are gradually being dis-
qualified for forfeits. It seems
with all this warm weather the ¢
girls are afraid that their

game will not be televised as }

not want all the TV viewers to ¥.-

we have. ‘

But, we do have a three hole §

There have been some great
volleyball battles in the gym
for the last six weeks but
unfortunately we still have no
scores to report. More on that
later.

It’s simpler and faster than putting on your eye
