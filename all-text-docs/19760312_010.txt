necticut University on Friday
and Saturday and one loss was
to Catawba yesterday.

The Davidson wrestling
team’s 47-6 victory over the
College of Charleston gave the
team a 5-5 dual meet record,
and it sent the wrestlers into
the Southern Conference Tour-
nament on a winning note.

Only four wrestlers entered
the competition, but three of
the four placed in their respec-
tive weight classes.

Mark Scandling, Ralph
Holloway, and Jack Summe
all placed fourth.

Mark Scandling lost in the
semi-finals of the 150 pound
weight class, but bounced
back to win a consolation
match before losing a 1-0
overtime decision to an old
rival from the Citadel.

Ralph Holloway lost to the
number one seed at 167 in the
opening round. Holloway won

two more matches, and then
lost a 6-2 decision to his
opponent from William and
Mary.

Jack Summe lost in the
semi-finals and then reached
the consolation finals, where
he lost 8-0 to the heavyweight
from Richmond.

The three fourth place fin-
ishes in the tourney, and the
5-5 dual meet record are the
best showings for a Davidson
wrestling team in three years,
and it leaves some optimism
for next year. The team will
lose only one senior, and hopes
to acquire several freshmen to
fill in the weak spots.

ting the game out of reach.
The final verdict was a miser-
able 4-19 defeat.
Davidson dropped a closely
contested 1-2 decision to Con-
necticut in the first half of
Saturday’s doubleheader. Tim
Barr started on the mound and
went the entire game giving
up only one earned run.
However, there was no hit-_
ting to support Barr’s pitching”
effort as Wildcat batters scat-
tered hits and could only score

LA CROIX

a single run.

In the second game, the
Wildcats probably played the
poorest they have thus far this
season.

Mike Hall opened at pitcher
and did not have a good day,
but the Davidson defense was
responsible for much of the
damage, as numerous fielding
errors led to several uneces-
sary runs.

Hitting was also weak as
the Cats were unable to score
any runs. The final score was
0-15.

After having Tuesday’s
home game with Heidelburg
College cancelled because of
rain, the Wildcats travelled to
Catawba on Wednesday and
lost 2-7.

Joel Tew was the starting
pitcher again, but he was
unable to control his game and
left after three innings. Tim
Barr replaced him but also had >
difficulty with the Catawba
batters.

Ed Willingham showed the
only hitting power as he
smashed a hard double that
brought in a run.

According to’Coach Palmer
Meunch, the Wildcats have
lost their first four games
primarily because ‘‘the pitch-
ing is not coming along as well
as expected. Also, nobody is
hitting particularly well now.”

Davidson will have the
chance to get untracked
against Pfeiffer again today,
and with a home doubleheader
against Marietta College on
Saturday.
