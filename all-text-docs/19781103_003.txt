The Davidsonian

Commons design proposed.

By BILL WILSON
Staff Writer

Physical Plant Director Gro-
ver Meetze and the develop-
ment firm of Marvin Associates
have assembled a tentative
design and site for the College
Commons, the proposed eating
house for freshman and inde-
pendent upperclassmen.

However, Meetze cautions
that these plans are only possi-
bilities at the present time.

The tentative design of the
building calls for an immediate
seating capacity of about 300,
with an additional dining shell
being built which could be
furnishéd and operative as soon
as the need for a larger capacity
arises.

With building: costs — increa-
sing at the rate of 1 percent per
month, Meetze feels that it. is
imperative that future needs be
incorporated into the present
design.

Presently the most likely site
is between Bailey and Richards,
the adjacent houses which cur-
rently serve freshmen and inde-
pendent upperclassmen.

The plan calls for the two
houses to be moved farther
apart to make room for the
Commons.

These houses would then be
used for eating houses for

upperclassmen.

Rather than resembling the
other twelve houses on Patter-
son Court, the Commons will be
built in a more ‘contemporary
style.

Meetze—hopes_to_utilize the
natural grade to construct par-
tially submerged kitchen and
service areas at the south end of
the building.

The dining area would look
out onto the middle of Patter-
son Court and would be glassed
in with a dining patio adjacent.
This plan would also include the
creation of an artificial lake in

the. middle of the Court, with
landscaping around it.
Meetze feels that the pro-

posed site is ideal from the’

standpoint of the logistics of
student activity. However, the
final decision depends on the
costs of the relocation of Bailey
and: Richards and the rerouting
of the power line which runs
through Patterson Court.

As of now, the building will
cost an estimated $2 million.

' Meetze believes that an archi-
tectural firm will be selected by
Thankegiving, and, after that,

(CPS)—As tuitions costs conti-
nue to rise, students are often
left wondering where all the
money goes. One expert has
spoken up to say that he knows
that, though faculty and staff
salaries account for about
three-fourths of a school’s bud-
get, the money doesn’t seem to
be going to faculty members.
Howard Bowen, economics
professor at Claremont Gradu-
ate School, has charted average
faculty wages and benefits from
1903-04 through 1976-77. His
figures show that, although
salaries have come a long way

the project ‘‘will be off and
rolling.” Actual construction

should begin by July, and the

building is scheduled to be
completed shortly before the
incoming freshman class arrives
in 1980.

Although these plans a are not

definite, Meetze feels certain _|

the Commons will be an innova: .

tive, vital building.

“The Commons will not be an
ordinary cafeteria,’’ he says,
concluding, its design ‘‘may be
a first” for the Davidson cam-
pus.

Faculty earnings drop

from 1903’s average $1500, real
wages have been declining in
comparison to other occupa-
tions.

-. Bowen warns ‘that if the
disparity continues, faculty
earnings in ten years will be 9 to
18 percent below those in other
occupations and, in 20 years, a
full third below.

The overall effect of the
declirie, Bowen says, is-tikely to
entice the most able academics
into other, more lucrative fields.

Bowen computed the salaries
in terms of 1967-value dollars.

hot,” commented Collins.

Collins continued, ‘‘We’re not
looking for New Yorker type
stuff. We’re out for stuff that
will appeal to students.”’

Faculty response has also
been favorable. According to
Collins, at least three faculty
contributions have been re-
ceived, and Art Professor .Russ
Warren has promised the maga-
zine some of his prints.

Collins said he hopes the

magazine can spark debate by

publishing five essays so far.

He explained the magazine
will print ‘‘some articles that we
feel will provoke opposing
views. We think of the maga-
zine as a platform for students’
ideas and thoughts.”’

Collins said the main obstacle
at present is selecting a printer.
“We have appointments to go
down to Charlotte and interview
three printers. Were trying to
get the kind of paper that will

Affirmative action is gasping

WASHINGTON, D.C..(CPS)—
A new survey shows that
despite many schools’ pledges
to increase minority enrollment,
affirmative action in higher
education admissions programs
is barely alive. A National
Association of College Admis-
sions Counselors survey of over
1,000. four-year schools found
that although 69 percent of the
schools said they have an
affirmative action policy, most
of them didn’t have formal
procedures for admitting more
‘minorities.

For example:

—84.5 percent of the schools

have no'goals for the numbers

of minorities they wish to
admit.

—-57:4:percent do not budget:
monies for minority student
recruitment.

—90.6 percent have the same
admissions requirements for
minorities they have for other
students.

85.8 percent give minority -’
enrollees no extra, time to
adjust. to college life before

“reasons.

The report, outlined in Hi-
gher Education Daily, also
pointed out apparent inconsis-
tencies in the importance of
standardized test scores to mi-
nority admissions. While al-
most all of the schools said
there is no difference in admis-
sions requirements for minori-
ties, 85.4 also said test scores
are not a major factor in
minority admissions decisions.
This ‘‘seems to indicate that
either the. institutions. contra-
dicted themselves. or aptitude
test. scores are not .a major
factor in determining admis-
sions for any students,’’ the
report stated.

Statistically , minority repre-
sentation in colleges has risen
_only 4,7 percent between’ 1969
and 1977 to its current 13.1
percent, while minorities are
16.1 percent of. the overall

Hall said the magazine will
choose a printer this week. ‘‘It’s
not really a problem,’ we just
haven't gotten one. yet,” she
remarked.

The magazine will be stan-
dard magazine size, 8’’ by 11”.
Collins estimated the first issue

will probably be 32 pages. Hail .

said the magazine will come out
five to six times a year, that is,
about twice each term.

“We'll have to check with the
Media Board, but what we want
to do is put one copy under each
door in the dorms and mail
copies to alumni as part of our
big subscription drive,’’ said
Hall.

The Media Board will also
determine the yearly procedure

for selecting the editor of the °

magazine. Probably upcoming
January elections will not in-
clude election of next year’s
editor of Hobart’s Park.

“The reason there won’t be an

election in January is not that.

a baby magazine and it needs

solid continuity this year;’’

‘Collins.demurred, ‘‘All of

mendations. I'd just as soon not
comment on that at. this:time.”

However, Hall continued,
“We've talked about it and. we'd
like to either have in-house
elections or appoint. There
should be no problem since
every editor, other than Greg
and Lyman and me, is a junior
or sophomore.

“It depends on what the
Media Board says. So far the
Media Board hasn’t: been orga-
nized enough to come to us,”
concluded Hall.
