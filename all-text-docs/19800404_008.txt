. And then suddenly, much to
our surprise, we see something
which is alien to all which is in

(ATO) as well. A tall bearded
fellow was one such creature, a
delightful young SPE known
affectionately as the Fiddling

his feet move and sing Cole
Porter songs. We asked this
petite oaf what sort of livestock

an underground domed coli-

served the purpose of keeping

the SPEs from penetrating the
Davidson athletic program. We
made our way inside, and guess
who was cheerleading? None

other than Joe Lambourghini .
and Rick (call me Dick) Kelley..

Both had bpen working out

, extensively in preparation for

holding up their Guernsey fe-
male counterparts on their SPE
shoulders. Their altruistic com-
ment was, “We cheer so that

others might play.”

Later on, we were fortunate
enough to be invited to the SPE
alumni weekend by Simple Si-
mon. Simon said (ha! ha! Simon

' Well, it was time to leave

now—it had been enlightening
‘and above all nauseating. Cap-
-tain Perk made the final. deci-.

sion to leave sinee he feared that -
our crew ‘might contract that
dreaded disease, SPE-D. Beam
us up, Merts, and then. obliter-
ate this place.

In response to pressure from
the top and because we feel like
doing it, we decided to say
something about IMAC this
week. The softball and volley-
ball campaigns are well under
way and IMAC czar Sterling
Martin seems pleased. As Ster-
ling put it, “The softball and
volleyball campaigns are well
under way and frankly, I’m
pleased.’’ In volleyball, Net
Result is the team to beat with
“Sweet Lou” Ortmayer, ‘‘Disco
Dave” Shi, and Peter ‘‘Dr. K.”
Krentz leading the way. They
will be challenged by FIDO,
-which numbers in its ranks the
ever-present Andy (I like Val-
entines) McDonald. Another
team to watch is the Penal
Spikes. These freshmen are
pated by the longitudinal Cliff
Tribus, winsome Walter Lee,
Mike “Mr. Flash’’ D’Urso, and
John (I like to nick around in
the showers) Carroll.

In softball, we see no clear-
cut favorite but feel that KAs,
SAEs, Fijis, PiKAs, or some
other team will probably go all
the way. The Masterbatters
have at once the sickest name
and best aggregate set of hands
of any team in the league. Other
than that, we can only hope
that all you softballers will .get
your feet in position and make
things happen.

It’s time to go now so see if
you can figure out this last
paragraph. Bear, Ben, Sam,
Barfin’ Bob, Earl, and Squid.

your knife in my room. Susan,
let’s play hoops next week.
Later.
