The Korean Revolution

Missionaries Unjustly Accused. Our
Missionary Safe, Soon Starts Home.

Pyengyang. Korea, March 29, 1919.
We have had a month full of excite-
ment since I last wrote you, and many
things have occurred to make our
hearts sad, though there seem some in-
dications that better things are coming,
and we are learning more and more to-
“have faith in God.” You have doubt-
less read of the Independence Move-
ment in the newspapers, and full ac-
counts seem to have gotten out, so much
of what 1 might say would only be old
to/you, and | will not go into any long
details. Our admiration for the Ko-
reans grows daily; they are truly a
wonderful people, and we cannot un-
derstand their long suffering patience
in any kind of persecution or suffering.
1 am certainly not undertaking to say
whether their move was a wise thing
or not, but they have shown determina-
tion, and have been most orderly on the
whole; and with one or two exceptions
(which we are not sure are exceptions)
have not resorted to any violence until
exasperated by violence used on them—
and even this only in a few cases, as
the leaders have always given strict or-
ders that. no abuse or violence was to
be used in any way. .

‘Taking the funeral of their former
emperor, which was to take place in
Seoul March 3. as an occasion, the Ko-
reans prepared beforehand many copies
of a “declaration of independence”
which were read at meetings held
throughout the country on March 1.
This declaration was signed by thirty-
three men, three or four of our strong-
est church pastors and leaders being of
the number, and the others composed of
prominent Koreans, for the most part
not Christians. After a memorial ser-
vice held at the meetings the declara-
tion was read, and then the people
marched out with Korean flags—also
prepared beforehand — and went
throughout the city shouting ‘“Hoorah
for Korean Independence!" This was
Saturday; on Sunday the churches were
ordered closed, and no services could be
held. For a few days in Pyengyang
like demonstrations were made, but they
were stopped by the police and soldiers
with untold cruelty towards the people
and many arrests, so that in Pyengyang
city there have been no demonstrations
of any great magnitude since. But the
movement spread throughout the coun-
try, and in two or three weeks time
there was hardly a place of any size that
did not have similar gatherings to the
ones here. These were all put down,
and in very many instances the cruelty
of the soldiers in firing on the people
and beating and cutting them up, was
horrible to tell. In = many country
places the persecution seems to be di-
rected against the church and others are
let alone. though, a& you see from the
signers, the movement is by no means
confined to Christians. In Seoul and
Pyengyang and other big cities the. larg-
est Korean shops have been closed, and
in Pyengyang now all the Korean shops
are shut up tight. Otherwise things are
fairly quiet just now.

As missionaries we were not consult-
ed beforehand, nor did the Koreans
bring us in in any way, knowing, ap-
parently, that we must remain neutral.
In some of the Japanese papers we: have
been accused as the leaders in all -this,
but any such statements have all been
denied later on. Our pupils all at-
tended the meetings on March 1, and
most of them were arrested sooner or
later, but at present only a few are left
in jail; indeed, most of them were let
loose the same day they were taken.
But this was not only true of our
schools, but of the government schools
also, and all had to be closed for a
time. The government schools opened
rather unsuccessfully for a short time,
but here in Pyengyang, at least, they
had to close again, as the pupils had no
mind to study. Christian schools have
been closed, with one or two exceptions,
since the beginning of the trouble. We
hope to open up at the beginning of the
new term in April. .

From what the papers have said, I
think the government is realizing that
they have made mistakes, and they will
doubtless introduce changes, and there
may be hope that the Koreans will have
more to say in the government later.
Of course, we cannot advise nor mix in

saw overseas service as chaplain during
the world war. .

A belated honor was awarded to W.
F. Hall, of Statesville, who was called
to the rostrum and informed that he
had been awarded the Davidson “D”
for championship on the tennis courts.

Members of the class were then called
before the rostrum and the presentation
of diplomas took place, Dr. Lingle pre-
senting each graduate with his diplonia,
with a few words of congratulation, and
a warm handshake.

During the announcements made just
previous to the delivery of the valedic-
tory by E. A. Woods, first honor man,
Dr. Lingle announced that the board of
trustees, at a prolonged mecting, had
recognized the loyalty of those members
of the faculty who had stood by David-
son in the years past. despite recent of-
fers of more attractive salaries — else-
where, by increasing the salaries of each
member of the faculty, and he further
announced that he was in favor of con-
tinuing this practice in the future.

Dr. Lingle read a touching letter to
the graduates from Dr. Martin, presi-
dent of the college, who is at Pass Chris-
tian, Miss., recovering his health. The
letter was as follows:

The Graduating Class of 1919.

My Dear Fellows:

Of all things that I have been com-
pelled to omit during my illness, I re-
gret nothing more sincerely than my ab-
sence at this hour when it would ordi-
narily have been’ my great pleasure to
present to each of you the diploma of
Davidson and declare you winners of
your degrees,

I am deprived of the opportunity of
wishing you, both for the college and
for myself, a hearty “God Bless You,”
as you go out into the wider fields of
the world.

We shall miss you from the campus
but we shall follow you with interest
and earnest prayer.

Remember you have been trained to
serve and not to selfishness, and my car-
nest prayer for each one of you is that
you may attain the true leadersiip
through unselfish service.

May God bless you ,cach one, and
keep you perfect in all your ways.

Faithfully Your Friend,
WILLIAM J. MARTIN.

Dr. Lingle also announced that a new
professor of English had been secured
for Davidson, the new man being Prof.
Kk. F. Shewmake, at present associate
professor of English at the University
of Virginia,

The class of '19 presented a clean-
cut, earnest appearance that — promises
well for them in the great world college
which they have now entered, and their
record in college, according to the mem-
bers of the faculty, is one that presages
good marks on the report cards of the
world, when they are called for, exam-
inations in life's greater tasks.

Dr. McCracken, in opening his ad-
dress, prefaced his actual talk by a few
remarks concerning the interests that
bind Pennsylvania and the Carolinas to-
gether. He mentioned that 142. years
ago, LaFayette had ridden from the
Carolinas to Pennsylvania, and that a
little later, Colonel William Davidson,
a native Pennsylvanian, came from
Pennsylvania to fight for freedom in the
Carolinas. He recounted how LaFay-
ette’s most. distinguished professor.
Francis A. Marsh, was summoned to
the college from the south, and how the
first president of LaFayette, George
Junkin, gave his daughter as bride to
that stalwart Presbyterian soldier,
Stonewall Jackson.

He told of southern students travel-
ing to Easton as they did to Princeton,
“drawn there by our common Calvin-
ism,” and said that at his own inaugura-
tion, the college was glad to adopt as
an honorary son, a native of Charlotte,
loved throughout the country and equal-
ly at LaFayette, although head of a rival
institution, Dr. Edward Kidder Gra-
ham.

Dr. McCracken declared that al-
though it was his first visit to the physt-
cal Davidson, the college was no stran-
ger to him, as he had viewed it from
the angle of Presbyterianism while he
was in Missouri. He regretted the in-
tangible veil between the two Presby-
terials and declared his hope that they
would soon be united in one great com-
mon cause.

He then took up his talk on “Defin-
ing the College Man,” and drew illus-

tration after illustration from the great
war. The speaker declared that men
are being measured differently at the
present time than they were years ago.
He said that the aim of the average col-
lege man might be likened to the objec-
tive of a military unit. He'told of the
difference in training during the late
war to that of other wars, and the
higher state of discipline necessary to in-
ure men to the necessity of advancing
slowly behind a barrage fire than was
required when they rushed their objec-
tives.

He drew a contrast between the ma-
chine-gun method of attack and the
common dirt trench that made the best
defense known during the war. as dif-
ferent and widely divergent methods of
attaining an objective. Dr. McCrack-
en declared that the objective of the col-
lege student is graduation and that the
members of the class of ‘19 had now ob-
tained their objective. He defined the
objective of the college, to develop the
best possible manhood. Dr. McCracken
said that the war had caused a re-rating
of the college man, making him more
self-reliant, quicker te think and more
alert in every way.

After a thorough dissertation of the
lessons tanght by the war, the timing of
the advance, the choosing of an objec-
tive and similar matters, Dr. McCrack-
en closed his remarks by an expressed
wish and belief that the men of the class
of “19 will attain their objectives.

NEW MEN HONORED BY

ALPHA DELTA SIGMA.

At a recent meeting of Alpha Delta
Sigma fraternity the following men
were initiated: E. G. Lilly, R. D.
Hall, Emory Flinn and W. M. Currie.
This fraternity is a local organiza-
tion, the membership of which is made
up of men who have represented the
college in an intercollegiate debate or
oratorical contest with other institu-
tions.

Its purposes are to stimulate interest
in public speaking and to arrange con-
tests both within the college and with
outsiders. A review of the year’s work
showed that the efforts of the members
in debating had been successful in up-
holding Davidson’s record in debates
with other colleges.

The other games had to be called off
on account of government regulations,

Basketball.

Mr. Miles, the “Y" Secretary, agreed
to handle this department, and soon af-
ter Christmas began work on his new
squad. Class basketball enabled him to
get a line on the prospects and to find
where they needed the hardest work.
Until the return of the prodigal “String-
bean” McAskill there was not a single
letter man to help with the practice.
His appearance added a little “scrap”
to the bunch and started things going
right. Before the close of the season
“Pup” Hall also received his discharge
and helped out in the last few games.

The first: game, played against the
Camp Greene quintet, was very encour:
aging. ending in the one side score: of
54-14. On the trip the Red and Black
met the heaviest opposition seen in many
years, Some of their opponents had as
many as five or six letter men returned
from the army. Although the mimber
of games won was not as large as usual,
the playing was entirely satisfactory and
gives promise of an invincible squad next
season, “The men winning letters in this
branch were McAskill (captain), Dav-
enport, Hall, Harrington, Schenck, and
Chalmers.

Baseball.

‘This team had a slight advantage over
the others in that there were cight let-
ter men returned this spring. Practice
was begua as carly in’ March as. the
weather would permit and> bv the time
they met the Phillies in) Charlotte on
March 29, the team was fairly well
rounded into shape, “Phe big victory of
the season was the defeat handed the
University of Virginia. ln this game
Clarke held his opponents to three safe-
ties and disposed oof thirteen) by the
strikeout method.

The old horseshoe got lost on the
trip and out of four extra session: games
only one ended in’ our favor “Phe
pitching of Clarke was the feature of
the season. In the fifty innings pitched,
two hundred and three men faced him
and only twenty-cight hits were regis-
tered. The big right-hander thus held
his opponents to a batting average of
137, The men winning “D's” were
Boswell (captain), Miley, Miller,

Spann, Ratchford, Sample, Richards,
McArn, Johnson, Cassell, Currie, and
Clarke.

There was the story of the negro °
troops coming across the Atlantic in a
transport. A submarine was — sighted.
The six sharp blasts from the whistle
shrilled out and the order was given to
the colored troops to fall in on the deck.
The negroes stood in line at attention,

waiting, silent and scared, while the
passengers gathered in the saloon. Then
the silence was broken by one big black
man in the rear rank who, in a small,
quavering voice asked: ‘Does any nig-
ger here want to buy a gold watch and
chain?”
