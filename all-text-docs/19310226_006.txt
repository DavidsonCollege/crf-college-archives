John Erskine Criticizes
Present Day Censorship

English Professor at Columbia Uni-
versity Speaks in New York
Against Literary Censorship

New York—(IP)—The most dangerous
form of literary censorship in the United
States is not legislative action prohibiting
certain forms of literary expression, but the
taboos placed on the author by the public
and the editors and moving picture man-
agers who select what the public shall read
and hear, Dr. John Erskine, professor of
English at Columbia University and author
of “Helen of Troy,” told the New York

Advertising Club at its weekly luncheon last
week,

The author today has to choose between
reaching a large audience and reaching an
audience which will understand what he is
attempting to say, the Columbia professor
said.

“The largest audience is reached through
the talking pictures,” he said, “the next
largest hrough the magazines, and the small-
est through books. However, the most per-
manence is found in books, and I think you
will find that there always will be books,
even if the author has to publish his own,
regardless of the development in the talk-
ing picture field.”

The real danger today, Dr. Erskine said,
is that the American author will, because

of the influence of magazine and motion
picture editors, become merely an entertain-
er. The American public, he said, does not
like to learn the truth about America, al-
though it enjoys reading foreign books tell-
ing the truth about Europe, because, “we
always are willing to believe the truth
about a foreigner.”

The minute an American magazine reaches
a circulation of more than a million or so,
Dr. Erskine said, the editor begins to think
his readers are all of a standard type, to
which he must cater.

“How the editor arrives at the conclusion
as to what type of matter his readers enjoy,
no author has yet been able to figure out,”
said the author.

The opportunity to the author is greater
today than ever before, he said, but the
temptations to do inferior work also are
greater.

FACULTY ENTERTAINS
(Continued from page 1)
the Yankee villain, and Miss Orrie Steele,
the old black mammy. The musical element
was supplemented by four students, E. K.
Eumurian, pianist; W. W. Caligan, banio
player; Dus Enochs, lyric tenor, and Brad-
ford McLean, black-face tap dancer.

At the conclusion of this half-hour play-
let, the guests retired to the banquet hall
below for supper. The hall had been beauti-
fully decorated for the occasion, white trel-

lis work being used on the posts, with a
smattering of green vines to lend effect.
This color scheme was continued in the
table decorations of green and white.

Supper was served by the faculty mem-
bers and their wives, attired in their pretty
colonial costumes. These costumes gave a
beautiful effect to the whole scheme. After
supper, the guests were offered other enter-
tainment, and the party was concluded about
11 o’clock.

Mrs. Lewis B. Schenck headed the social
committee which planned the entire affair,
and associated with her in various capacities
were Mrs, W. L. Lingle, Mrs. Geo. B. Watts,
Mrs. Price H. Gwynn, Mrs. Emily Cullum,

Mrs. Jno. A. Otto, and Mrs. W. N. Mebane.
