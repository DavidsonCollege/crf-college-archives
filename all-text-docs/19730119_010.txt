By DAVID MELTON

The Davidson Rifle Team
hopes to improve its dismal
record this week-end in Gains-
ville, Florida.

The Wildcat marksmen will
square-off against the Univer-
sity of Flomda, Auburn and
Georgia Tech.

The Cats are still looking tor
their first victory in four starts.
The losses have come at the
hands of Clemson in a _ pre-
Christmas match and_ to
Presbyterian and Appalachian
last week-end.

Coaches of the team, Captain
Abel White and SFC Charles
Glenn, feel that this vear is a
“rebuilding year”’.

The members of the team
that will make the trip to
Florida are Jim Fagan, Clark
McChesney. Pete Goodman,
Bob Miles. and Bob Turnage.

Fagan. the leading scorer and
only returning letterman on the
team said, **Most of the team
has never shot before so we're
using this vear to build our
scores.

He also added that “the last
several years have not been
very prosperous tor the rifle
team. and so this vear we're at-

tempting to promote interest
and gain experience within the
team in order to re-establish
our position at the top of the
conterence standings.”

with the team, from what I
have heard."’ He has not thus

mention that, ‘‘This was a very
promising year. Dave Weaver
and Bill Allen are both retur-
ning, along with two foreign

“I think there will be a great
deal of competition among our
players for the positions,”
Frank added. ‘This will make
for a very exciting year.”

Frank said that he has wan-
ted to come back to Davidson
and the tennis program since he
graduated.

“I recognized all that Coach
Fogleman has done for this
school,”’ he said. ‘‘He built a

strong and prominent
program.”
“IT am_ dedicated to

developing tennis even further

Scott said that a coach would

the Wildcats on the scoreboard
but still behind by a six point
deficit.

However. in the 131 lb. match,
Davidson co-captain Rob Benton
put his man on the mat for a fall
in the second period to even up
the score.

Fellow captain Rusty Win-
chester ‘out finessed” his op-
ponent in the 142 Ib. class to
keep the Cat streak going and
Davidson now was in command
11-8, according to Parker.

In a very close match, John
Scandling lost a close decision
in the 150 lb. category, but
Davidson's Webster dominated
his opponent for a four point win
to keep Davidson ahead by one
point.

In the 167 class, Wildcat John
Kennelly dropped an _ 8-1
decision to Catawba's Cun-
ningham to give Catawba a
slight edge.

Unphazed by this, freshman
Raipn Holloway dropped his
competitor in 3:02 in the 177 Ib.
bout.

With Davidson ahead by a
scant 21-20, Cat Charles Dorsey
lost by decision but Davidson
won it in the end when big Bill
Garrett. wrestling in the heavy
weight class. won with an 11-1!
decision to give the Cats a scant
victory over Catawba.

The only other team the grap-
plers have encountered this
season was the North Carolina
Intercollegiate Match at Chapel
Hill.

Parker was pleased with the
win over Catawba and is now
getting the team ready for
Friday night's meet with Wash-
ington and Lee.

“The meet should be both
very interesting and very ex-
citing,’ Parker said.

Both Parker and the team are
hoping for a large turnout at
tonight's match to be held in
Johnston Gymnasium.
