DR. FRASER HOOD SPEAKS AT
ROCK HILL.

Makes Two Addresses and a Ban-
quet Talk.

Dr. Fraser Hood, our Professor] '

of Psychology, by invitation of the
Anderson Motor Co., of Rock Hill,
spoke to its one hundred or more
representatives from all over the
United States on October 13 on
“The Contribution of Psychology to
the Problems of Salesmanship.”
This address was so impressive that
Dr. Hood has been asked to furnish
copies for publication in several
automobile journals as being the
first speech of its kind applying
psychology to the selling of auto-
mobites.

Dr. Hood also made a very inter-
esting talk at the banquet given for
those attending the three-day con-
ference of the Motor Company.

While in Rock Hill, Dr. Hood was
requested . to speak to the young
ladies of Winthrop College. This
he’ did at their chapel service, his
subject being “Psychology in Life.”

ASSISTANT MANAGERS
ELECTED.

A meeting of the Athletic Asso-
ciation. was called by the president
after chapel Tuesday, October 12.
for the purpose of electing assistant
baseball and basketball managers.

There were four students who
had previously been nominated by
the executive committee of the as-
sociation for assistant managers;
they were:

L. W. Dick, George Cornelson, J.
I) Price, and D. P. McGeachy.

Since there were no further
nominations, upon the suggestion
of the president the first two candi-
dates were named as assistant man-
agers for the D.C. quintet, and the
second two for the Davidson nine.
They were unanimously elected to
office by the student body.

How It Works.
(Or a visit to our Laundry.)

We woridered how they did it, so
we sauntered down to see. The
process is indeed marvelous and
Pwonderful to behold.

First, the clothes are run thru the
De-buttoner, When the — clothes
come out of this machine they are
carefully examined and if any but-
tons remain they are run thro again,
After it is certain that all these hard
obstacles are removed the clothes
are passed thru the Ripper and
Mangler a truly marvelous pre-
duction of mechanical genuis which
does all that its name implies. From
this contraption they go to the De-
colorer and from there to the Stun-
er and Streaker which is also one
of the seven wonders of Davidson.
They are then passed thru the Dis-
torter and pushed thru the Wrinkler.
The clothes are now moistened, tied
in knots, and packed into small
packages whieh can be had by giv-
ing your phone number backwards
to the manayrer.

First Fresh “Do you drink any
thing ?”

Second Fresh. “Yes, anything.”
