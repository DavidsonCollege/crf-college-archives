P. G. SUTTON ELECTED PRES-
IDENT OF THE ATHLETIC
ASSOCIATION.

In the elections held in chapel
Monday morning, P. G. Sutton was
elected president of the Athletic As-
sociation. He comes to this high
office with a brilliant record in the
athletic circles of Davidson, and is
admirably equipped to fill this new
office in a manner that will reflect
glory upon himself and the asso-
ciation of which he is the president.
It was Pig lron Sutton who helped
to make the class of ’20 all-class
football champions away back in
1916, and in °17 he made the Var-
sity baseball team, and the coveted
“D". The scrub football team of
1918 was materially strengthened
by his position on it, as was the
Varsity baseball team in 1919. Of
course we can safely say that the
new president ofthe Athletic Asso-
ciation. will put everything he’s got
into the baseball team of 1920, and
come in for a big share of the suc-
cess which it is bound to attain.

For the benefit of those who have
not labored up the three flights of
Chambers to President Sutton’s
apartments, let us say that it will
be well worth your while. You will

see there the clock which ticks the |

knell of classes day by day, the bell-
cord by which their deaths are pro-
claimed to the world, and the man
“who is responsible for your arising
at 7:15 and a large part of your out-
goings and in-comings each day you
are at Davidson. At home, Presi-
dent Sutton is a delightful host, and
may favor you with a demonstration
of sewing a button on a soft collar,
as he did The Davidsonian’s report-
er who called to interview him. In
‘all things he lives up to his motto—
“Conservative’—but this does not
mean pepless. From ringing the
bell to discharging the duties of
president of the Athletic Associa-
tion, Sutton is full of pep—an effi-
cient, quiet, forcible pep, the pep of
great leaders. .

A. L. CURRIE IS CAPTAIN
OF THE BASEBALL TEAM

Election Held in Chapel Monday
Morning.

The captain of the baseball team
for 1920 ts Buck Curric. When we

look at Currie’s record we see that}

his name appears among many kinds
of college activities. In his Fresh-
man year he made the Varsity base-
ball team, and when a Sophomore
he was a star in Varsity baseball,
and we have no doubt that Buck
Currie will make a successful cap-
tain.

In announcing his policy regard-
ing his administration of the 1920
baseball team, Captain Currie says:

“ft believe in moderately intensive
training, and putting the men on
their own responsibility to stay in
condition; but there is no chance
for any man in poor condition to
make the team.”

According to Captain Currie, the
prospects for Davidson's baseball
team this year are
better than last year, except as
regards a pitcher. Because The Da-
vidsonian believes that Captain Cur-
rie is all right, it predicts for the
baseball team and its new captain a
brilliant record and added glories to
old Davidson from the diamond.

Physical Examination Shows Da-
vidson Men in Good Trim.

The physical examinations for the
R. O. T. C. were resumed last week
by Dr. J. W. McConnell. Those ex-
amined were for the most part
Freshmen, although a few Seniors
were put through the mill. The ex-
aminations began last fall, but were
postponed on account of the forced
absence of Dr. McConnell.

As yet only about 75 per cent of
the men have been examined. Those
remaining will probably undergo in-
spection at the end of this week. On
the whole the physical condition of
the men is very good, only eight per
cent being found unfit physically for
the RB. O. T. C.

Volunteer and Ministerial Bands
Hear McClure on Convention

Joint Meeting Recipient of Much
Informetion About Vol-
unteer Work

Sunday afternoon the Volunteer
and Ministerial Bands united to hear
R. E. McClure present the great
outstanding thoughts of the recent
Volunteer Convention. Unfortun-
ately only a meager summary can
be given here.

John R. Mott sounded the key-
note of consecrated service: “No
pursuit is secular to which God calls
young men.” God calis and uses
consecrated men in many different
walks of life. The army on foreign
soil cannot exist without the sup-
port of the “folks at home.”

This broad view of a life of serv-
ice makes the selection of one’s life
work much more serious than the
erroncous view that} man’s only
great field of service is in the min-
istry. It throws a fellow back on
‘prayer as the only means of deter-
| mining that life work for which God
created him and in which he can
best be used. True prayer is only
the prayer of one who is fully sur-
rendered to God’s way of answer-
ing it.

Such a call to service demands the
full consecration of every man who
aspires to the name of Christian to
the task of attaining, insofar as in
him lies, the “evangelization of the
world in this generation.”

MR. GEORGE E. WILSON RE-
TIRES FROM BANK PRES-
IDENCY.

Bank Progresses Remarkably Un-
der His Management.

The Charlotte Observer in its
issue of the fourteenth refers ed-
itorially to the retirement of Mr.
George [2. Wilson, 1867, from the
presidency of the Merchants and
j Farmers Bank of Charlotte.

The record of progress made by
the bank under Mr. Wilson’s pres-
idency is one of the remarkable
incidents in Charlotte’s financial
growth, surplus and profits having
| scored an increase from $89,707.68
to $363,370.36, the sum disbursed
among — stockholders, meantime
having amounted to $368,500.00 in
dividends. When-> Mr. Wilson as-
sumed presidency of the bank its
stock was valued at $145 a share.
it is now more than $280. a share.

Doug Fairbanks There With the
Goods

“Um not from Maryland, but [’d
make a mighty good ‘watch-dog’.”

“Oh! I feel I'm about to faint!”

“Well, why don’t you?”

In “The Man From Painted Post,”
“Doug” Fairbanks, assisted by leap-
vyear’s cupid, proved himself as gal-
lant and successful in taming a rare
specimen of the fair sex as in bronco
busting and pulling that two-gun
stunt. .
| Such a variety of action cannot be
beaten for simply passing away the
time. But that is not all, for an in-
jtelligent audience, whose time is
worth more than the killing, can be
satisfied with nothing short of the
best. But how obtain the best?
Why not try the plan so success-
fully used in getting the best for the
library? If you have ever seen or
heard of a good show, dig up its
title, number of reels, name of film
company; whenever you sce a real
good.one be sure to jot down this in-
formation in your hand-book and
when you have an opportunity, do
your best to get it thru the Y.

the curative properties of the bark, it
was given the name we know it by to-
day—quinine.

In their cfforts to cvangelize the
heathen scattered through the vast
arcas of northwest South America, the
Jesuits also discovered a tree that grew,
more or less, in all those regions, the
sap of which was splendid for stopping
the Now of blood from a cut. This was
also gathered by them and in time made
known to the civilized world, and today
in Europe still bears the name ‘Friars’
Balsam,’ and in Latin-America of ‘Bal-
samo Catolico,’ or Catholic Balsam.

In more modern days it was a Prot-
estant missionary, laboring among the
natives of the Niger River delta, in West
Africa, who discovered the valuable
properties of the stones of the fruit of
the oil palm. The natives were in the
habit of throwing away most of the
stones, a few being cracked and the ker-
nals removed, after pounding and cook-
ing off the oil-bearing fruit surrounding
them, because they were sweet and good
to chew. The inquisitive missionary ex-
amined these edible kernals, and found
them very oily, so much so, that he tried
to persuade the traders to buy them, and
have the oil extracted. The traders,
however, thought this merely a mission-
ary'’s crazy idea, almost as foolish as
trying to Christianize the natives, and
would do nothing about it; but the un-
daunted missionary sent some of the
kernels to Europe for testing.

It was found that the kernels con-
tained large quantities of oi! that was
valuable for a great many purposes,
edible and otherwise and a trade in them
begun at once. This has grown so fast
and to such a size, that today, it is sec-
ond only in importance, and in some
places more important, than that of
the fruit itself.

It also was not long before another
use was discovered. It was found that
the nutcake from which the oil had been
pressed made a splendid cattle food.
Everyone knows that oil is fattening
and palatable, and evidence of the
wholesome effect of the kernels on the
cattle was shown by the sheep of the
natives which greedily ate all they could
find of this waste. The use of the nut
cakes greatly increased the value of oil
palms.—Ex.

parliament in the North ard another in
the Sonth of Ireland; the two could es-
tablish whatsoever unity they desired.
Eacli of the two parliaments would have
taxation powers equivalent to those of
the State legislatures of the United
States. The income tax and the excess
profits and supertaxes would be levied
imperially. The Irish parliaments would
control all local matters and all ma-
chinery for the maintenance of law and
order except the higher judiciary and
the army and navy. The custom and ex.
cise services would be retained by the
imperial parliament, but when Ireland
was united it would be open to the im-
perial parliament to consider whether:
united lreland would have control of the
customs.

This plan differs from all other plans
that have been proposed and we can
see no good reason why any one should
object to it. Every good reason for
home rule is just as potent for two par-|
liaments as for one. Great Britain can-
not and should not permit Ireland to set
up an independent government, but it
can and should give to the people of

MEDITATIONS FOR THE NEW YEAR

May this day and all the days of the
New Year bring to you and all those
who are dear to you the sunshine of
happiness.—Richard Brooks.

To work to help and to be helped, to
learn sympathy through suffering, to
learn faith by perplexity, to reach truth
through wonder—behold! this is what it
is to prosper, this is what it is to live—
Phillips Brooks.

Put out of your thought the past
whatever it may be; let go even the
future with its golden dream and _ its
high ideal; and concentrate your soul
in this burning, present moment. For
the man who is true to the present is
true to his best; and the soul that wins
the ground immediately before it, makes
life a triumph—Ozora Stearns Davis.

Resolved, to live with all my might
while I do live; resolved never to lose
one moment of time, but to improve it
in the most profitable way I possibly
can; resolved, never to do anything
which I should despise or think meanly
of in another; resolved, never to do
anything out of revenge; resolved, never
to do anything which I should be afraid
to do if it were the last hour of my life.
—Jonathan Edwards.
