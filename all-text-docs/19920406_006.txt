Beyond Birkenstock:

Hey, The Birks Are Back.....Read On and ENJOY!!!

“Biologists have discovered . .
what appears to be one of the
largest and oldest living creatures
known to science. This subterra-
nean monster is about as massive
asan adult blue whale. Its life span
compares with that of the giant
sequoia. It is a mushroom.”

The Charlotte Observer

April 2, 1992

Well, Birkies . . . science has
finally done something useful.
Apparently during a break from
creating toxic waste or plastic patio
furniture, a particular group of
scientistsin upstate Michigan iden-
tified a monster of a mushroom
bigger than five football fields.
Quite a find, huh? (And, for all of
those who may be interested, this
one is non-hallucinogenic.)

Now, you’re probably think-
ing of some gargantuan fungus
ripping up trees and throwing boul-
ders. You know, something for
Godzilla to contend with, now that
Mothra has passed away-- some-
thing like the Blob. Or maybe
Evander Holifield would take this
thing on for the world title, since
Mike is otherwise occupied (he
can’t getaway rightnow). No, no
... enough humor for a moment.
This innocuous giant is no match
for a garden tiller, much less Don
King. In fact, the scientists who
made the miraculous discovery are
declining to pinpoint the exact lo-
cation for the mushroom’s own
safety (besides, they say it’s deli-
cious).

Although the train of thought
might suggest it, we’re not bring-
ing this poor, innocent mushroom
into the harsh, fluorescent glow of
media scrutiny for no discernable
purpose. Neither are we trying to
note with irony how something
that has lived undisturbed for 1500

years probably hasn’t got a snow-
ball’s chance in hell of lasting two
more years if its whereabouts be-
come generally known (a couple
of weeks ago, some well-meaning
morons scrubbed priceless prehis-
toric paintings offacave in France;
they thought they were cleaning
graffiti.)
No, what we

size (whether deserved or not) has
fundamentally shaped the way in
which our civilization is organ-
ized. Bigger is necessarily better.
Bigger guns, larger ships, more
magnificent buildings . . . what-
ever it is (especially in America,
but not exclusively) it better kick

about St. Mary’s of Topeka?
Basically nothing. The Kansas
diocese probably makes most of
the decisions and the Vatican only
intervenes to collect the poll tax.
What does all this have to do
with the Big Mushroom? A lot.
Are you beginning to see how
mushroom-like
these things be-

thought we’d dwell on
today has more to do
with the size of the
fungus than with its
tenuous existence.
Have you ever noticed,
whatever it is . . . if its
the biggest whatever,
you'll see it in the pa-
per or on CNN. The
venerable 24-hour
news network takes it
as its sacred duty to
report every 2000
pound peanut butter
sandwich that some PR
firm in Georgia slaps

come? Well, it’s like
this. The mushroom
is so large that it
doesn’t even care if
some scientists take
abig chunk of itand
sauté it in a good
white wine. We
should mention that
the fungus’s ability
tolose a large chunk
and continue on
about its business is

speaking) an advan-
tageous survival
tool.

honestly cares if the

same phenomenon is universally
present. Remember that film in
your high school science course
that took the time to mention “THE

BFD. Think about it, and you’ll
see how common this fascination
with size really is. Quick ... what
attribute is Dolly Parton best known
for? Certainly, its nother consum-
mate acting skill in Sylvester Stal-
lone movies. And our most con-
vincing example . . . that’s right,
John C. Holmes. We don’tneed to
beat this thing into the ground. Its
just an observation.

OK, the point. It seems to us
that this human fascination with

some butt. You think it was an
accident that the Pentagon is the
largest office building in the world
(we think)? Its the largest because,
by implication, we are the best and
thus need a bigger building than
anybody else on earth.

What do you do if you want to
establish the legitimacy of your
religion... that’s right, builda BIG
church. -Now think, what’s the
biggest church you’ ve ever heard
of-- yep, that Vatican-based thing.
Here’sa fine example of the addic-
tion to bigness endemic to society.
How exactly does the infrastruc-
ture of the venerable Roman Catho-
lic Church break down? Well, the
Pope bone’s connected to the Car-
dinal bone . . . the Cardinal bone’s
connected to the Bishops’ bones .
.. and onto infinity. Anyway, our
question is this: how much do the
Pope and the Vatican really know

Rude Notes and Random Scribblings

It's Our Responsibility to Act Accordingly

Students have in the last sev-
eral week looked to others to place
the blame for “unavoidable”
changes in the alcohol policy. They
have scapegoated everyone from
SAE to Dean Terry to Dean Wil-
liams. One popular group to har-
ass is the Charlotte news. Why do
they care so much about Davidson
anyway? For that matter, why
does anyone care? The answer is
the government.

Earlier this year the national
government approved a change in
its policy regarding federal funds
allocated to private and public

‘colleges and universities. To en-
force their imposed drinking age
on college campuses they designed
asystem under whichcolleges had
to make a good faith effort to rid
their campuses of underage drink-
ing. Now, I am not sure how this
money is allocated to Davidson
College, however, the word on the
street says we get some.

By drawing attention to our:
drinking, breaking bottles and
windows in our houses, leaving

cups all over the Court, we are
defeating our own cause. We cre-
ate a scene which can very easily
be seen as a problem, even if we
see itas every day college life. Itis
unfortunate that the SAE problem
arose at this time when you con-
sider that many of the allegations
hovering around that house involve
drinking, but this is not there fault.
The college has begun to abuse a
privilege they take as a right.

We are underage drinkers,
most of us, and it is illegal in every
state in this country to drink alco-
hol. It does not matter if you see
your drinking as a matter of con-
venience or civil disobedience, you
are breaking the law. As an insti-

tution Davidson can not condone’

this behavior, no matter how much

we complain about the proposed

changes.

The solution is not anger but
action. We must control our drink-
ing as a group. We must show
Kuykendall and his insurers that
we can handle ourselves. This
campus will go dry if widespread

abuse continues.

But, what does that mean,
abuse? Certainly, it brings up the
problem of alcoholism but it car-

ries another meaning. Asa school
we must stop going to class drunk.
Going to class with a hangover can
be handled, for a hungover person

In human .sys-
tems, like Davidson

College, redundancy is just waste..:

The likelihood thatanyone is going
to come along and kill the Regis-
trar is very small (probably nonex-
istent). So why areall those people
in that office? Well, you might
reply, FOR GREATER EFFI-
CIENCY. Uh huh... we gotta
bridge we’d love to sell you. How
many of you have experienced that
famous Davidson efficiency?
Trying to get a transcript before
Friday is the real “Davidson expe-
rience.” Or try putting meals on
your CAT card without walking
back and forth across campus three
times.

The same efficiency that pro-
duces YOUR GOVERNMENT is
also at work on YOUR CAMPUS.
Who do you think pays the bills
around here anyway? The tuition
increases at leastnine percentevery

is no more difficult to deal with
than one who has stayed up all
night studying. However, a drunk
student disrupts class.

Another problem lies in the
numerous fights that take place on
the Court. These do not give the
administration the confidence they
are looking for in us. We must
show that we can handle ourselves
in a social manner. As the man
says, we must learn to handle our
liquor. It should be the responsi-
bility of the house holding the party
to break up the fight not by kicking
one or both of the opponents in the
groin, but by calming them down.
Take therm outside if necessary;
send them to satellite to fight it out
alone, but don’t let things get out
of control.

Essentially, the problem lies in
our hands. If we can keep the
faculty out of our faces, if we can
keep the cameras off campus, then
we can keep our privilege. We
must show that we intend to be
responsible for something we can
not take for granted.

nine per cent better every year?
What do we deserve, another fac-
ulty secretary, or another faculty
member? Let’s include “making
copies” in the job descriptions for
professors. Stop thinking and get
back to work! (Of course we’re
being facetious.) Thanks to David
Campbell, we can conclude that,
in twenty-one years (given a 9%
increase every year), our children
will be bringing this tuition bill
home, annually: $1,039,761.55.
Whoo!

In addition, the infighting
produced by redundant depart-
ments and bloated staffs suggests
that personnel reductions proba-
bly wouldn’t hurt anybody that
much (are you listening Trustees?).
A cursory look at the catalog and
wecounteleven people with “dean”
in their title. So who’s the “Dean
of Deans” around here? There was
atime when there was one school,
one dean. Is this just title inflation
running rampant (thanks Dr. Hol-
land)? We have a situation where
one dean signs onto areport highly
critical of another (and you know
who you are). The way w2see it,
accountability on either side seems
incredibly muddled. Let’s clear
“em all out and start over with half
asmany. (We’llkeep Dr. Kuyken-
dall). And this could apply to all
levels of school administration.

Maybe then we could go one
whole year without increasing tui-
tion, and perhaps attract back some
of the middle class students that
made the name Davidson worth
something. So you see, it all goes
back to that mushroom. A seem-
ingly innocent, yet surprisingly
insidious fungus has become our
paradigm for a creeping, expen-
sive, and largely. useless social
trend toward bureaucratization and
waste. Let’s unload some ballast
before the ship sinks.
