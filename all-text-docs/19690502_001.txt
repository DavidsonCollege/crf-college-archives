Hobbie commented to the
Senate, “I dont see how

need for cars to the need to

Coed Exchange Week Dissolve
From Lack Of Student Support

By DAVID GRISSETT ~

Asst. Managing Editor

The Coed exchange week
between Davidson and Ran-
dolph-Macon College was
cancelled Tuesday afternoon
because of a lack of applica-
tions for participation from
Davidson students. |

The exchange week had

been scheduled — for
week, May 5-12.

“We have no other choice
but cancel or ‘at least post
phone coed week," said Jon-
ny Jewett, Chairman of Coed
Week in an interview late
Tuesday afternoon. ‘The sole
reason is that we couldn't
get enough students to go,”

Resolution Action Stalled;
IFC To Open Investigation

Only one committee has
taken any direct. action in
response to last week's Stu
dent Life Committee resolu
tion on fraternity hazing.

The resolution, which con
demned actions on the parts
of individual fraternities dur
ing Greek Week activities,
called for action from the
Interfraternity Council, the
Jurisdiction Committee and
the Committee on the College
Union, Fraternities and
Clubs.

The judicial board of the
IFC is the only group ‘that

Spencer:

The college may come out
in the black on a budget
which predicted a deficit of
about $50,000 when adopted
last year, President Samuel

R. Spencer Jr. said this
week.
“When the budget was

made up in the spring of
1968 for fiscal ‘69, which is
the current year,” explained
the president, ‘‘it included an
anticipated deficit of about

$50,000.
“Because of savings we
have been able to effect as
we have moved along this

has responded, although the
Committee on the College
Union, Fraternities and Clubs
met and decided to abolish
itself.

The IFC judiciary conduct
ed one trial of a Greek Week
offense this week, and plans
to conduct a series of inves
tigations into the alleged ac
tivities.

“Whether the result be a
conviction or not,’ said
IFC Vice President and Ju
dicial Board head Dave Was
serman, “‘we do believe that
the action now under way
will alleviate the problem
next year,”

The hazing activities in
question were condemned by
the Student Life Committee
after an article appeared in
the April 11 edition of THE
DAVIDSONIAN describing
specific acts of hazing.

The Committee on the Col-
lege Union, Fraternities and
Clubs voted last weekend to
seek a revision of the facul-
ty constitution which would
dissolve the committee.

Accoraing to a_ printed
stateraent, the committee
members felt that its func-
tions were covered by the
Student Life Committee, and
since the SLC is an elective
committee and has wider
functions, the committee said,
the lower, appointive com-
mittee should be “‘the one

resolution,

Jewett said,

He said that though the ini
tial number of applications
by Davidson students for
coed week had been 110, this
number had dwindled to the
eighties and could easily
have gone lower.

“It would be essential that
Davidson students fill a dorm
at Randolph-Macon, and we
just don’t have that number.’
he said.

Jewett made the point that
the Coed week committee at
Davidson made extensive at
tempts to stir up interest in
the program by letters, post
ers, and talks on the project
ed week. “We postponed
deadlines for —applicatiots
too, but to no. avail,” he
said.

On The Inside

Money that could have been used for a sym-
posium — $650 in fact — is going back to the
college at the end of the year unspent, while
$300 is being reserved for a trip to a summer
student government convention.

All of it happens without the knowledge or
concurrence of the Senate, which has sole power
to appropriate student funds.

As the student

government concludes the

third consecutive year in which it has overbud-

geted

and underspent,
delves into the maze of student finances.

Past editors and staffers take a-humorous look
