iStudents’ checks
plague merchants

By STEPHEN GOLD
Staff Writer

Bad checks are giving Davidson College students an
untrustworthy reputation in the Davidson-Mooresville com
f munity, and soon students will be forced to carry more cash}
; says Chairman of the SGA Bad Check Committee Bill Peeples}

In an affront to the Code of Responsibilities, students are now
more than ever writing checks that fail to clear the bank and
-businesses in the area are becoming concerned.

The bad check problem has been around since students were
originally given the privilege of writing checks without
identification requirements. The administration never became }
alarmed at the average of three bad checks per term, and would
pay the students’ bills, until the students could pay the
administration back.

But starting in January, 1977, when King Sirloin in
Mooresville. received five bad checks, ‘‘the situation became
more intense,’’ Peeples remembers.

By the time spring arrived, the SGA deemed it necessary to
take appropriate action against the sudden rise in bouncing
checks, and a standing committee, the Bad Check Committee,
was formed.

Committee alters extended studies

By AMANDA HALL
Managing Editor

The Educational Policy
Committee (EPC) has pre-
sented a proposed revision of
the Extended Studies Policy
to the faculty for vote on
Tuesday.

The Proposal recommends:

1.That every department of-

fer an Independent Study or

Tutorial listing open to stu-
dents in any class or any
major.

The Committee’s reasons:
Many projects now underta-
ken under Extended Studies
might appropriately be given
departmental names, thus
making a transcript more ac-
curate. Further, departmental
control of independent pro-
jects might result in better
supervision of both teaching
load and project quality.

2. That Extended Studies for
juniors and seniors be abo-
lished (301 and 401), and that
each department or program
submit to the Educational
Policy Committee any sug-
gested revision for major re-
quirements.

The Committee’s reasons:

The 301-401 programs are
already under departmental
control, as they should be. The
program, as now mandated,
seems to ask a consistency
among departmental require-
ments which may place un-
warranted limits upon pro-
grams which the departments
now require of their majors. It
is not the intention of the EPC
with this recommendation to
reduce the number of courses
required for graduation.

3. That Extended Studies for
freshmen and sophomores be
continued for projects and
semifa?s” tiian av i0tfall
within departmental frame-

works. Extended Studies pro-
jects will be evaluated only on
a pass-fail basis, and students
may register for no more than
one such course per year.
Faculty members may assume
responsibility for no more than
three such projects per year.

The Committee’s reasons:

Under the Extended Studies
Program, worthwhile projects
and seminars have been taken
which do not fit neatly within
departmental structures. The
Committee feels, though not
without dissent, that such
opportunities should be avail-
able within the constraints of
faculty time and faculty ex-
pertise. In expectation that
such projects will be super-
vised outside of departmental
constraints, the Committee
recommends that grading be
on a pass-fail basis. -

4. That the catalog lists the
following:

Interdisciplinary Study:

Courses and seminars of inter-
disciplinary study for which

no available departmental lis- .
ting is appropriate. The course ~

or seminar proposed must be
approved in advance of its

‘ offering by the faculty spon-

sor(s), the departments in-
volved, and the faculty.

The Committee’s reasons:
Such a listing will encourage
the development of interdis-
ciplinary courses, but will
assure that any such course
will have the approval of the
faculty. |

The EPC prefaced the pro-
posal by saying:

In reviewing portions of the
curriculum, in particular the
Extended Studies program,
the Committee on Educational
Policy has been emphatic on
three points ; 1. the desirabi-
lity of indcpeiden. scady"Oe-
tions available to all students;

2. The insistence that all an independent project as an

faculty sponsors of such pro-
jects have both the time and
the expertise to sponsor a
project suitable to a liberal
arts curriculum; and 3. the
placing of the initiative for
work upon a motivated stu-
dent, not on one who may,

College slices NIH

By PHILIP DUNCAN
News Editor

On the advice of the col-
lege’s legal counsel, President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. has
authorized a cutback in a
Federally-funded _ internship
program for Davidson stu-
dents at the National Institute
of Health in Bethesda, Mary-
land.

Spencer

Spencer has limited the pro-
gram’s budget to $9500 in
order to avoid the requirement
of signing certain government
forms which must be initialed
by_the college if tne budget ex-
ceeds $10,000.

In the past, the college has
signed the contract for up-
wards of $30,000.

College Counsel Larry Da-
genhart explained that those
government forms ‘‘would ap-

“pear to require aty affirmative ~-

action program in hiring and

easy grade.

Both Academic Vice Presi-
dent and Chairman of the EPC
Price Zimmerman and former
EPC member and Chairman of
the Extended Studies Com-
mittee Hansford Epes expect
the proposal will go into effect
in September.

other areas. They would ap-
pear to require that Davidson
do some things it might not
want to do or might not be
able to do.”

The internship program,
which is coordinated through
the Office for Experiential
Programs, allows students to
work and research at the In-
stitute during a term or a
summer and receive $1000 to
$1200 from the government for
their efforts.

Dagenhart further ex-

_ Plained the college's reluc-

tance to sign the forms re-
quired by the government.
‘The forms are broader than
the law and subject to the
interpretation of government

.agencies,”’ he said.

He indicated that the lang-
uage of the forms is sometimes
unclear and that the cutback
decision is a reflection of
“honesty and uncertainty’’—
honesty because the college
does not want to submit itself
to any type of affirmative
action program, and uncer-
tainty over the intent behind
some of the language in the
forms.

“‘As lawyers we take a con-
soso ct swine: these mat-
ters,’ Dagenhart said.

“Traditionally we have not
change (curriculum) in the
middle of the year,’’ said
Epes.

“Normally the departments
let majors continue in the
program they started,” Zim-
merman explained. Epes ex-

program

Director of Experiential
Programs Ken Wood says that
15 students have participated
in the program since it began a
year and a half ago, and that
all have found the internship
to be a valuable personal and
educational experience.

The NIH has interviewed
and accepted more than a -
dozen Davidson students for
this year’s internship program
but Wood says that with the
$9500 limit no more than nine
students will be able to par-
ticipate in a given year.

Wood fears that the cutback
may even jeopardize the entire
program.

“The people who head this
program at NIH have com-
municated with me their chag-
rin that we have limited the
program to $9500.’’

He explained that the NIH
must take into account the
administrative costs of mak-
ing several trips a year here to
interview students ‘‘and if
they can think in terms of
interviewing and selecting a
very few, it may not be in their
best interests to continue.”’

Wood recognizes the col-
lege’s reluctance td submit to
any form of government en-
croachinent, but believes that
