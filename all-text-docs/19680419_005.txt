Tale Of ’Cat Nine -- Defeat;
Topped By USC, Belmont

By BOB DUNHAM
Sports Editor

The Wildcat baseball team
continued this week in its
seemingly endless search for
a victory, as it fell to South
Carolina and Belmont Abbey.

According to ‘Cat cdach
Tom Stevens the team was
simply unable to put all of
the elements of winning
baseball together at the same
time.

“We have good pitching at
times,’’ said Stevens, ‘and
at others we have good bat-

=>
s?

ting and fielding. But we
can't get all three to work
together."

Yesterday's contest with
South Carolina found the
Wildcats playing good de
fense, but unable to put to
gether good hitting or pitch
ing ‘attacks.

“We had seven _hits,”’
Stevens said, ‘’but they were
scattered. We left eight men
on base. and you just can't
win unless those men score.’

South Carolina tore into
the ‘Cat pitchers in the 5-2

East Carolina,

The Davidson tennis team
took to the road early this
week and returned home
with victories over East Car-
olina and North Carolina
State.

The Wildcat netters swept
both matches by wide mar-
gins, as they dumped ECU
7%-1'2 and the Wolfpack 8.1.

The East Carolina match
Monday was halted by rain
fall during the final doubles
contest. With each team
holding wins in one set in
that match, the rain forced
the split match.

Coach Harry Fogleman
said that the ,Pirate squad
was much rougher than he
had expected, and that team
members were ‘‘very sur-
prised" by the difficulty of
the match.

Tuesday afternoon, the
team swept all but one match
from N. C. State in Raleigh.
The victory upped the Da.

vidson team record for the
season to 14-1-1.

. Fogleman commented that
Dan Hearon, who is still re-
covering from a back injury
suffered in a match with
East Tennessee State, play.
ed quite well in the Wolfpack
match.

Woody Faulk drew consid-
erable praise from Fogleman
for his play in both matches.

In looking forward to the
Southern Conference tourna
ment next month in Lexing-
ton, Va., Fogleman is not
overly optimistic, and said
that it would be a very tough
tournament.

He has chosen his first two
doubles ‘teams for the tour-
nament. Berner and Hatcher
will take on the number one
doubles competition. while
Hearon and Faulk will pair
for the number two compe
tition.

triumph. Southpaw Clark
Nickerson started the game,
but lasted only three innings
before Stevens pulled him to
put in.Macky Reavis.

The Gamecocks picked up
nine hits in the contest and
took advantage of the few
Wildcat errors to pick up
their scoring.

Davidson picked up one
run in both the eighth and
ninth innings. The first tally.
came with pinch hitter David
King's single, while the sec.
ond resulted from a USC wild
pitch.

Monday afternoon the ‘Cats
put together a good hitting
attack, but under a faulty
field they fell to Belmont
Abbey 13.6.

“We really should have won
that game,"’ said Stevens in
commenting on the game in
which Davidson lost a_ six-
run lead. *‘We hit well enough
to win, but once again we
couldn't. get the whole game
going at once.”

King took the Belmont foss
_in relief. as the Abbey team
blasted the ‘Cat nine with 10
runs in the last three in
nings.

Davidson's record now
stands at 1-16, with the most
important conference games
left. .

“We can still take the con
ference,” said Stevens,
“since we have played only
one conference game, but
we're having player troubles.
so it will be rough.”

16 Teams Ready To Run
In Tomorrow’s Relays

By KENT RHODES
Sports Writer

Cinders will fy and un-
doubtedly records will fall to-
morrow afternoon as Rich.
ardson Field becomes the
site of the tenth annual
Davidson Relays.

Davidson, Pembroke and
Cumberland loom as the fav-
orites to take the team title
in the relays which will in-
clude competitors from 16

schools of the Piedmont
area.
Davidson coach Heath

Whittle, coordinator of the
relays, said that this year's

competition should provide .

“the most interesting meet
we have hosted.”

The Wildcat trackmen will
be led by high-scoring indi-
viduals Greg Cox and Rick
Lyon. The team also expects
to pick up a high javelin
finish from Wayne Huckel.

Cumberland has two top
teams in the 880 relay and
the shuttle hurdles. The lat-
ter is a new event in which
one runner runs a 120 yard
high hurdle leg, tags another
runner who runs the opposite

direction over the hurdles,
and so on for four men.

The Cumbertand cindermen
are the defending champions
in the relays, which David-
son has won seven years in
the last nine.

Other top performers are
expected from Catawba and
Mars Hill. Bill Griffin, last
year’s winner in the shot
put, will lead the Catawba
team, while Mars Hill hopes
to top his performance. Ca-
tawba also has an extremely
tough sprint medley relay
team.

Other schools competing
in the meet are Carson-
Newman, Elon, Lenoir

Rhyne, Appalachian State,
Wofford, Presbyterian, High
Point, Atlantic Christian,
University of North Carolina
ait Charlotte, and Western
