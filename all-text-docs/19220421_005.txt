THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 21, 1921.

A Patriotic Girl.
Red hair.
White teeth.
Blue eyes.

Don’t ever count your chickens before
your roommate.

The Secrets of Success.

“Push,” said the button.

“Make light of everything,” said the
match,

“Stick to it,” said the glue.

“Never be led,” said the pencil.

“Be up-to-date,” said the calendar.

“Take pains,” said the window.

“Let’s stick together,” said the three
flies as they lit on tanglefoot.

A wild lunch—animal crackers.

Sears Roebuck, Montgomery Ward, or
the Baltimore Bargain House catalogs
haven’t any difficulties at all. Just look
at the new Davidson College catalog.

A college paper is an ideal invention—
The college gets all the fame,

The printers get all the money
And the staff gets all the blame

Pests.
An 8:30 class. :
Six unexcused absences,
Students who ask questions just as the
whistle blows.

Life says, the present day “flapper”
can dress on $66.33 if she only dresses
her hair.

Why doesn’t the faculty add a course
in cow punching for the Juniors to ma-
jor in?

Tears there were in the potatoes’ eyes,
The celery hung its head—

Sadness reigned in the pantry that night,
For the mother of vinegar was dead.

Get a Barrel.
Here lies the remains of Jimmie Polk;
He thought red phosphorus was a joke,
He put it in his jeans by chance,
And blew the bottom out his pants.

Navigation.
Bitzer—How you like my new shoes?
Barr—They’d be alright if you had a
good looking girl to break a bottle of
champagne over them.

' How Sad.
Vampish vestal virgin beguiles guile-
less Gamble. ‘

Is Wasn’t the Commissary.
Bishop entered his room late one night
last week, just as the lights went out.
“Darn that wood alcohol,” he said.

There were several contributions made
to the “Mighty Hoag” gallery of famous
students this week. Among them were
Sam Story, Hunky McLeod, Rolston Bit-
zer, and Spratt Moore.,

Blythesome Bob.

It is rumored-on-the campus that a
very prominent Senior from first floor

Spring Opening

Watts has formed an entangling alliance
with a blythesome young lady. What
about it, Bob?

Pat Miller certainly has quite an at-
tractive personality—even the wild and
wooly grizzly bears are strangely at-
tracted by him.

Heard In Chemistry Lab.
Fresh McGregor—“‘How much does a
gram of magnesium weigh?”

The Height of Hard Luck.

Last Saturday morning Fresh Moss
was heard asking a prominent lady of
the town how much an engagement ring
would cost. Saturday night Fresh Moss
was observed on his bicycle headed for
Queens. It has been found out later that
his girl had gone home for Easter and

he did not get to see her at all. He re-
turned to ~Davidson Monday sorely
downcast. Cheer up, Moss.

| ACT Il—The Reckoning.

Scene: The same room, third floor Georgia,
Lack. The time: 9:15 a. m., and thereabouts.
“Mack” Lennox is lolling lazily in the rock-
|ing-chair; he puffs a Camel held in one of
those “see you next weeks,” a smile overspreads
|his handsome (?) face. Apparently he is
content with the world and the inhabitants
| thereof.
| Enter “Bill” Carroll, his room-mate.

C.—Well, how's Mary?
| L.—Sweet as a peach.
| one in a thousand!

C.—Though she’s spilt the beans?

L—She might have, but if she did she

picked ’em up, let those lovely eyes of hers
them a bit—and lad—they’re just
peaches and cream. Bill, why don’t you—-—-

C.—Wait a week—hold steady! None of
| your tmoralizing on what I should do—did you
stop at Mellon’s? fz

L.—Did I? (Points to pile of bundles on
| table) Tl say I did. He's got some line
| too—niftiest,I ever saw. Here let’s see (opens
bundle)

C.—Why so many shirts? You must be go-
ing into competition with Ikey Morris.

L.—Nope—such good things I couldn’t re-
sist. See that white one! The one with the
attached collar; well it was only two fifty.
Those——

C.—They look good to me.

L.—Those blue pin-stripes were three-fifty—
some nifty garment for your old Uncle Ned,
eh—hau’ some for three but thought that I’d
try these.

C.—What’s in that little bundle?

L—Wait and see. (He opens, bundle.)
Ain’t they pippins? '

C.—I'll say they are—you ain’t quite gonner
strut your stuff. What’s the dope?

L.—tThey’re new, the latest out; just hit
Broadway last week—fancy open-knit ties—if
they aren’t snappy French is a crip.

C.—The tax? :

L.~Two bones and four bits—Berkely make
-—and say boy, ain’t they the stuff? (Adv.)
