‘Wu speaks out against human rights violations

Wu tells poignant tale of political struggle, unjust imprisonment, and hard-fought freedom

By Apam HICKEY

Harry Wu’s poignant tale of
political struggle, unjust impris-
onment, and hard-fought freedom
brought Love Auditorium to its
feet Monday, November 13.

Originally arrested in 1960 as
a political dissident, Wu related
the 19 years he served in a laogai,
or Chinese forced labor camp, and
how he emigrated to the United
States in 1985, where he continued

his education in engineering at the

University of California-Berkeley.
Wuthen worked at the Hoover
Institute, where he pursued a study
of the forced labor camp system in
China.
“IT hope laogai becomes an
English word, just as you can now

find ‘gulag’ in the dictionary,” he
said, urging audience members to
remember that the evils of Nazi
concentration camps are repeated
today in Chinese prisons.

While Wu condemned human
rights violations of all kinds, he
focused specifically on the forced
labor system in Chinahe witnessed.

Posing as an American busi-
nessman, Wu told of his mission to
China in cooperation with CBS
and how he taped government of-
ficials offering him the use of
cheap, forced prison labor to work
in his fictious factory. The docu-
mentary, which aired in 1991, in-
furiated the Chinese government.

So did his later work with the
British Broadcasting Company,
which led to an exposé of the gov-
ernment practice of selling organs

Discussion elicits
energetic dialogue on
Million Man March

By KirsTEN RECKNAGEL

Describing an experience “too
powerful to imagine,” four
Davidson students who partici-
pated in the Million Man March in
Washington, D.C. last month
helped lead an open and animated
discussion about race, equality, and
the Million Man March last
Wednesday at the BSC House.

Organized by Krissie Johnson,
Special Events Chair of the Black
Students’ Coalition, the forum,
titled “The Million Man March:
Where do we go from here?” fea-
tured moderator T.X. Green and
student marchers Carlos Bowen,
Damon Colbert, Shakeem Lane,
and Karim Lawrence.

The program began with an

interview session, during which
Green asked the four panelists to
share with the audience their most
memorable experiences and les-
sons from the march.

Highlights cited by the march-

ers included the sense of unity and _
peace that pervaded Washington’s .

Mall, where hundreds of thousands
of black men gathered in late Octo-
ber to re-affirm their values, re-
solving to strengthen their com-
munities.

Atone point during the march,
Louis Farrakhan asked the men to
hold hands with each other. The

panelists agreed that this scene, a .

sea of black men holding hands
and sharing love, left a lasting im-
pression.

Lawrence mentioned the im-
pact of séeing “brothers who have

obtained from executed prisoners.

As a result of his work Wu
was blacklisted. He was unable to
obtain a visa until March of 1995,
and he was able to do so only
because his name as entered on his
American passport was unfamiliar
to the Chinese.

Wu was recorded by surveil-
lance equipmentat the border, was
recognized, and was arrested
‘shortly thereafter on charges that
included, among other things,
misrepresention to the Chinese
government.

Wu said his trial lasted four
hours; he was found guilty and
sentenced to deportation.

Wu protested the sentence and
was jailed under house arrest for
66 days until he was released and
allowed to return to the United

States on August 24, one day be-
fore First Lady Hilary Rodham
Clinton announced she would at-
tend the upcoming Woman’s Con-
ference in Beijing.

Wu alluded to a connection to
the two events when he thanked
Clinton for taking a stand for hu-
man rights.

Though the lecture was for the
most part very sobering, contain-
ing such moving moments as Wu’s
recollection of the death of his
mother and estrangement from the
rest of his family.

However, Wu’s sense of hu-
mor emerged often, such as when
he gave a description of what he
did for entertainment during his
jailing: singing Elvis Presley’s
“Love Me Tender” and telling his
guards (who were forbidden to

speak to him) of O. J. Simpson, the
Chicago Bulls, and Rodney King.

During his imprisonment, Wu
said he requested two of his favor- °
ite books: Herman Melville’sMoby
Dick and Ernest Hemmingway’s
The Old Man and the Sea, from
which he takes the motto: “Man is
not made for defeat.”

Said Wu of how his experi-
ences have changed him, “I passed
the line between life and death
several times. So now I define life
and death in different ways.”

Wuclosed with gratitude, say-
ing, “I am honored to be a part of
the United States and that Ameri-
can people care about me.”

The lecture was sponsored by
the Public Lectures Committee and
was funded by the Wearn Lecture-
ship.

Million Man March panel discussion held at the BSC.

gold teeth holding hands with busi-
ness men... Everyone’s status was
equal.” Green agreed that the
marchers’ discipline, peace, and
respect were felt intensely by those
present in Washington. However,
he remarked, “CNN can’t tell you
that ... CNN won’tshow you that.”

After the initial interview ses-

sion, Green shifted the program’s
focus, encouraging the audience to
ask questions of the panelists as
well as of other audience mem-
bers. Questions, comments, and
ideas were voiced by nearly all
present, and although the subject
matter was often controversial and
sensitive, the dialogue.was charac-

terized by respect.

Intended to provoke thought
and encourage communication, the
Million Man March forum did just
that. The BSC-sponsored discus-
sion continued for nearly two hours,
fueled by the genuine interest and
energy of its leaders and audience
members.
