participated in thrée-a-day
practices which emphasized ball
control, passing, and physical
conditioning.

Joel Shirk, who along, with
Kevin Robbins and David Her-
rington is a tri-captain for this
ypar’s team commented on last
season ‘Last year was disaste-
rous. Coach Kremser in his first
year in college demanded so
much of us‘physically that we
became mentally and physically
drained, and thus incapable at
playing the way I think we were
capable of. Also, our schedule
pitted us against nationally
ranked opponents.”

Herrington notes that, ‘The
schedule .is more reasonable this
year. We're trying to play more
North Carolina schools without__
compromising the competition.
There has been a recent influx of
new coaches, players, and en-
thusiasm throughout the
state.”

Shirk concluded that, “‘Ideal-
ly our schedule would be com-
prised of three groups; those
matches we feel confident of
victory, those matches that
could go either way, and those
matches that would require a
superior effort by everyone to
insure victory.”’

Shirk said of this year’s team,
“Our weakness is that we're a
young team. Over one half of
our team are freshmen. This will
become a strength in future
years, however. Overall, indivi-
dual skill is much higher this
year.”’

Herrington continued, ‘‘One
of our strengths will be our

short passing game and ase
to control the ball.”

“ Another strength is that we
finally have some players that
will make things happen on the
