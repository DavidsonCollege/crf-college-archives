Netters approach tournament 20-6-

By MARK SCANDLING

Davidson’s Tennis team
dominated the Southern Con-
ference in the late 60’s and
early 70’s, but the most recent
championship team was the
1973 team.

The Davidson netters enter
the Southern Conference
Tournament this weekend as

slight favorites. The team
sports a 7-0 conference record,
and is 20-6-1 overall.

Coach Jeff Frank is opti-
mistic about the tennis team’s
chances, yet he realizes it
could finish no better than
third. The main reason for a
poor finish is that the David-
son players are used to playing
on the slower clay court, « but

Citadel drops Cat trackmen
championships fill weekend

By DAVE KELLER
Features Editor

The Wildcat trackmen
ended their regular season
with a record of 2-4 Saturday
when they fell to the Citadel
87-76 in a dual meet held here.

The meet was close from the
start, but in the end the
Citadel’s greater number of
first places edged out David-
son’s greater depth.

**We had to have our best
performance to win--everyone
came through, but a few
disappointments probably
cost us the meet,” said coach

Sterling Martin.

The Wildcats had seven
first places in the meet, seve-
ral of them surprises. Doug
Horn was the only Cat to take
two firsts, as he won the
steeplechase in 10:48.3 and the
880-yard run in 2:00; he also
placed second in the mile.

In the field events, first

the tournament will be played
on the faster hard surface
courts.

Some of the close matches
the team won on clay surfaces
could very easily be lost on the
hard surface courts.

‘*We are coming to grips
with the hard courts now,
due to eight days of practice
on them,”’ Frank explained.
‘‘We cannot prepare much
more, our performances will
depend on our confidence, and
not the style of court.”

Frank hopes to have four
number one seeds in the
tournament.

He expects John Mitchell,
Steve Holman and Brian
Cooper will be seeded first in
their division. According to
his coach, Holman has the
best chance of winning the
championship, for he beat
each of his conference oppo-
nents in straight sets this ,
year.

The number 3 doubles team
of Holman and Steve Johnson
should also be a number 1
seed. The number 1 doubles
team of Boswell and Bondu-
rant will be seeded fourth, yet
Frank feels these two sopho-
mores have the best chance of
winning in doubles.
