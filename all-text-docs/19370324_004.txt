Once again vacation time nears—
though it lasts but a week. What
are you going to do? Are you go-
ing to spend your time inside or
outside? I mean to ask you wheth-
er you plan to spend the day asleep,
the night for activity, or are you
going to get outside for golf or what
you prefer?

Here’s just a thought from the
corner. Why not decide now to
take your golf clubs home, your
tennis racquet, whatever
prefer for exercise in the spring.
The “ole wim, wigor, and wital-
ity” will be be all with you when
you return.

No Sponsor

I’m now going to bat on a ques-
tion that has arisen. Did you know
that practically every officer or
leader of any importance on the
campus has a sponsor in the an-
nual but the captain of the foot-
ball team? In almost every. college
or university the football captain
is one of the first to get a sponsor
but here he is overlooked.

This phase of activity—the var-
sity football team is one of the most
promi t and r ted org
tions on the campus. Outside of
what namé*he makes. for himself,
the captain receives little reward
for his, four years of bruises and
work for the college. Why shouldn’t
he deserve a sponsor too?

The inter-fraternity track meet
was a big success again this year.
Johnny Sadler was the big individ-
ual noise of the meet. He won,
the century, the two-twenty, tied
for first in the hurdles and broad
jumped, Other outstanding winners
were: Bruce Edgerton, Chubby
King, Bailey Williams, Al Cum-
bie, Milton Crisp and Tom McAlI-
pin. Much interest was aroused
and who knows but some future
cinder star may have dis-
covered,

been

Why now can’t a campus‘wide
golf tournament be run in addi-
tion to the annual fraternity team
competition. The golf course is
swarming with players so why not
give them a chance to match skill

. (and luck) against one another. A
moderate entrance fee could be
charged and, thus purchase a suit-
able trophy for the winners.

Athletic Situation

While many students go home
Easter, most of our spring sport
teams are on the road. The base-
ball team will be definitely whittled
into shape when it comes back. The
golf team is definitely, up to par
and will give a good account of it-
self before the year is out.

The tennis set-up is stilled mud-
dled. The tournament is not near
completion yet and the season is
already under way.

A movement—and a worthy one,
has been started to remove the
present situation whereby double
cuts are given to a student attend-
ing football games off the cam-
pus. This is a funny situation where
the students are penalized for sup-
porting the college team in their
games on enemy soil.

Why not age the student:
to carry the Wildcat spirit away
from the campus by following and
backing our teams. Certainly, the
Present system doesn’t encourage
this as a practice. One such trip
costs a student two-thirds of the
cuts allowed for a whole semester.

When next this paper is publish-
ed a new hand will guide this page
and write this column. However,
in this, my swan song, I would like
to thank publicly such fellows as
Bill Marquess, Perry Sloan, Ken
Lawson and the others who have
helped so much. I’ve attempted to
be fair in giving credit where cred-
it was due. Special thanks are due
to Fred Smith for co-operating in
giving you pictures of our sports
celebrities. Again I say, if you
have enjoyed this page at all, we
feel we have done our job and can
lay down the task with a feeling
of satisfaction.

RIFLEMEN NEAR CLOSE
OF SCHEDULED MEETS

Kunz, Thieling, ling, Warlick, Pharr)
and McLean Shoot in
Hearst Meet

The Davidson College rifle team, |

under the leadership of Major Bal-
lard, is nearing thé end of its sea-
son. Only one more match is |
scheduled, which is due to be shot |
sometime soon after the holidays. |

Last week the team fired the last |
position in the Hearst Trophy
match, This match has been going!
on for a month now as the members |
only shot one position each week.
The object of this lapse between
each position was so that the mem-
bers would be rested and would
have plenty of time, to do their best
shooting. The scores of the match
were as follows:

1—W. E. Kunz, with 185 points
out ofa possible 200. 2—Thieling
with 182, 3—Warlick, with 175.
4—Capt. Pharr with 174. 5—David
McLean with 155. The four posi-
tions in which the participants had
to shoot are standing, kneeling, sit-
ting, and prone. All men shot very
well in all, but standing, according
to Captain Pharr.

This year’s team is being paced
by W. E. Kunz, a freshmen from
Tennessee, and Thieling, last year’s
captain. These two are about even
in their scores so far, and the last
match may decide the winner of
medal, for the best shot. Says Pharr,
“Kunz is a mountaineer from Ten-
nessee, and his ability as a rifle-
man came from the constant prac-
tice he received, while participating
in the family feud against the Coys.
Kunz became an expert shot and
could crack off a Coy at 500 paces.”

Show Promise

Coach Laird Expresses Opti-
mism Regarding Team

With the arrival of spring on the
Davidson campus has come daily
Practice for the twenty-odd .play-
ers hopeful of making Coach Laird’s
first-string nine.

The team is coming along well
for the little practice it has been
able to get and the genial coach
seemed to be in an optimistic mood
regarding the season's outlook the
other day. There are no injuries
to speak of on the squad with the
exception of Shorty Bankhead’s
arm, Shorty was in a wreck last
summer and pulled some shoulder
muscles which are still giving him
trouble when he throws. However,

| it is being treated daily and the
| doctor holds out hope that the short

one will be able to use it by the end
In the event that his
wing does not respond to treatment
Sam Hemphill will take over the
keystone position. This substitu-
tion will make little difference to
the team defensively, but will hurt
somewhat. Last year

| Shorty was lead-off man and man-

aged to get on base with surpris-
ing regularity.
Rudsill Looks Good

First base is still a toss up be-
tween Swede Johnson and Teeny
Lafferty and Laird said that his
mind could, not be made up until
after several games have been play-
ed. In the meantime -ahot-battle
is being waged for the position va-
cated by Lafferty in centerfield.
John Rudisill, stocky slugger, is a
leading candidate for this post, but
will have to reckon with Parks
Hand, Dick Lindsey, Jim Terry and
John Irwin.

Eddie Steere joined the list of
hurlers several days ago when
Coach Laird decided to give him’ a
chance on the mound. He has a
good fast ’un and the coach has
been giving him considerable prac-
tice in throwing to the bases, which
seems to indicate that he is plan-
ning to use Eddie. At shortstop
and third base Bill Quick and As-
busy Howard have practically
cinched positions and are work-
ing fogether nicely in practice.
Laird’s main problem now ‘is to
strengthen the hurling corps and
find some sluggers.

The Davidson trackmen opened
their cinder season Saturday on

Pikas and KA’s Follow Lead-

’ Meet Friday

PRELIMINARIES TUESD’Y

tury race in 10.9 seconds to set a
