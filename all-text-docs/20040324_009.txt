RLO charged with hazing

Freshmen forced
into mandatory,
humiliating activites

BELK—Sources reported Monday that
the Davidson College Residence Life Of-
fice (RLO) is under “serious investigation”
for hazing activities. RLO may face formal
charges as early as next week for subject-
ing first-year students to a variety of-ac-
tivities described as “discriminatory,”
“humiliating” and “stupid.”

Derek Freeman ’07, a first-year student

from Orlando, Florida, was the first to- ~

bring forth charges. “I was sitting in
[Sigma Phi Epsilon’s] house meeting lis-

A freshman is hazed ~

tening to the PCC anti-hazing talk, and it
all seemed so familiar: Then suddenly it
hit me—we’ve been systematically hazed
by RLO since day one.”

According to various sources in the
first-year class, within hours of arriving at
Davidson, freshmen are forced to endure
“agonizing” rituals to which upperclass-
men are not subjected. Examples of haz-
ing include being forced to pose for “idi-
otic” photos, participate in‘embarrassing
games, and stand in really long lines.

“The Freshman Olympics were so hu-
miliating,” moaned Jack Lennox ’07. “I
completely fell on my butt during Crab
Soccer, and there was this really hot girl
who just completely cracked up. I felt so
dissed, but what was I supposed to do? I
thought that I just had to endure what
RLO put me through to prove
myself worthy of Davidson. But
now I realize that it was hazing,
and I have rights. Maybe I’d
have less trouble getting a date if
all those girls hadn’t seen me
trip during the shoe race.”

The hazing doesn’t stop at
Orientation, according to Katie
Tiernan ’o7. “I couldn’t believe it
when they said that freshmen
lived on separate halls from the
rest of the students. We’re
clearly being treated in a sub-
human manner—especially
those of us they stick in Rich.”
Tiernan pointed out that various
freshman-only activities, like
“pointless” weekly hall meet-
ings, demand an “unreasonable
period of time” from freshmen
and thus also qualify as hazing.

“We're also the only ones who
have to attend those stupid
Davidson 101 classes,” added
Kelly Davis ’07. “The college
website says that if we’re co-
erced to attend meetings that
upperclassmen aren’t required
to be at, that’s hazing. So why

ing 06. “To simultaneously cherish diver-
sity and keep all of these white guys
around is quite an accomplishment.”

Added Fielding: “Although you’d think
with all these white guys we'd at least have
a decent Baseball team.”

For their part, the admissions office
maintains Davidson couldn’t be more on
the right track in terms of diversity.
Brooks has even announced plans for an
ambitious new dormitory to be built to
house Davidson’s minority students. Lo-
cated prominently on the north-Cham-
bers lawn in front of Little, the building

will come replete with a state-of-the art
exterior lighting system and enormous,
clear-plated windows. “It’s just our way of
saying we appreciate what you bring to
our school,” said Brooks, who has already
re-directed campus tour routes to cross
directly in front of the i impressive new
building.

“I’m bothered when people get caught
up talking about ‘Web pages’ and ‘realis-
tic portrayals or diversity on campus,”
Brooks continued. “People who do this
are treating diversity on campus like it’s a
number or a statistic. The fact is these are
real people we're talking about. Smiling,
photogenic people.”

are we the only ones being forced to an-
swer questions about whether we're com-
fortable with masturbation? If that
doesn’t cause ‘severe emotional stress’ I
don’t know what does. RLO has a lot to
answer for.”

Sofirces at RLO have defended their
practices, saying that the Davidson “fresh-
man experience” is a valuable part of a
student’s first collegiate year. “The Orien-
tation activities, Davidson 101 classes and
freshmen hall programs are all designed

to welcome our new students,” claimed
area coordinator Kathy Lee King. “Any
humiliation they may experience as a re-
sult is strictly an added bonus. I mean,
come on, they're /reshmen.”

Y studying for GRE

HART-—Senior Ben Clampton has clearly

_ been studying for the GRE, sources close

to the Hart 319 resident reported Tues-
day.

“We knew something was weird when
he came in yesterday,” commented room-
mate Zeb Stevens’04. “He said he’d been

mounte-bank about the précis of a tome
rife with pleonasms. All I could say to that
was ‘wha’?” :
Tensions escalated when Clampton de-
clared himself “regent plenipotentiary” of
the living room, exclaiming, “Gevalt!
What gemiitlich-bereft Grand Guignol is
this? Would it kill us to own something

puce?” Although he hates to “niggle over
nugatory,” Clampton demanded at dinner
that his roommates “mitigate their masti-
cating,” whereupon he relegated their
television set to the position of “techno-
logical incunabula.”

His improved vocabulary has also been
noticed by Clampton’s girlfriend, Mary
Spence’04. “Ben said my shapely poste-
rior was altogether callpygian, especially
when I engage in tarantism,” said Spence,
“which I guess is nice.”

Clampton later described Spence as
both “libidinous and lubricious,” noting
that he really hopes the couple can engage
in “post-collegiate concubinage.”

In the mean time, his roommates can’t
wait until he finishes the GRE. “Christ,”
commented roommate Brad Duff04. “I
mean, what the hell.”

Clampton declared that if his room-

mates don’t stop. being such
contumavious cockalorums he might well
be forced to absquatulate.

“There are those who say I’m loqua-
cious,” Clampton noted.

“But I just call it an insatiable love of
the sesquipedalian.”
