chaplain. Spencer said that in
the past the church shared
programming costs, but the
College paid the assistant min-
ister’s entire salary.

The College is now negotiat-
ing with DCPC to finalize the
job description, which must be
approved by the Executive
Committee of the Board of
Trustees, Spencer said.

“I hope by November 1 we
can be on the way to looking for
someone (to fill the position),”
Dean of Students Will Terry
said.

In the area of athletics, the
Trustees reaffirmed a 1973 pol-
icy statement which places all
Wildcat Club funds under the
jurisdiction of the Athletic Di-
rector.

Fund-raising for athletics
should not decrease general
support of the College, the
Trustees stated. Therefore, the
Wildcat Club should seek sup-

port from “non-contributors or’

marginal contributors’’ and co-
ordinate all its fund-raising
efforts with the Development
Office.

The campus Advisory Coun-
cil on Intercollegiate Athletics
gave a report to the Trustee
Athletic Committee about the
visiting committee’s evaluation
of Davidson athletics (see The
Davidsonian, Sept. 19).

Council Chairman: David Shi
said there was ‘‘no reaction—no
decision’ concerning the report,
only a ‘‘very general discus-
sion.”’ Spencer said the Trustee
Athletic Committee will present
a written report about the
evaluation when the Board next
meets in February.

Shi said he thinks the Trus-
tees will concentrate this year
on fund-raising, especially on
Athletic Director Eugene Bing-
ham’s plans to raise money for
minor sports. Shi predicted no
changes in ‘‘the major pro-
grams” in ‘‘the near future.”’

the new Vice President ‘‘should

cause of an alumnus’ “‘built-in

In the filling this important
position, Spencer said, the
Trustees agreed that finding the
“right person is more important
than the time factor.”’

The Development Depart-
ment reported to the Trustees
that the College has received
$1,017,000 in gifts since the last
Trustee meeting in May. Of
these, $270,000 were individual
gifts, $250,000 were foundation
grants, $397,000 were unit
trusts and gift annuities, and
$100,000 were bequests.

Most of the other financial
issues were ‘‘housekeeping re-
solutions,’ Spencer said. For
example, the Finance Commit-
tee will select a new debt
managing firm for the endow-
ment, according to Business
Manager Robert Currie. The
College is seeking ‘‘a little more
active management of the debt
portfolio,’’ Curry said.

The Trustees also heard re-
ports on proposed curricular
changes, the new computer
center, and recommendations
for modernization of the Biolo-
gy Department, Spencer Said.

Educational Policy Commit-
tee (EPC) Chairman Price
Zimmermann outlined the com-
mittee’s proposals for changes
in the core curriculum. The EPC
will publish its proposals next
week,

Director of Computer Ser-
vices Robert DeSieno described
his plans for the creation of the
new Davidson computer center.

And Associate Dean of the
Faculty Nicholas Burnett’s re-
port on ‘proposed new direc-
tions in biology’’ provoked
some ‘interesting discussion”
among the Trustees, according
to Spencer.

Last year, an evaluation com-
mittee recommended that the
department place more empha-
sis on molecular biology. This

The reason for the campus
interest in role-playing fan-
tasies is, according to Univers-
ity of Minnesota sociologist
Gary Alan Fine, tied to a desire
“to move away from passive
intellectual activities, notably
television.”

Fine spent 18 months re-
searching D&D and four other
fantasy games, and found the
appeal in the ‘‘science fiction
sub-culture’”’ was the opportun-
ity to live out fantasies they

TSS, which was first identi-
fied in 1978, is caused by
bacteria which collect in the
vaginal tract. A tampon, by
sealing off the area, makes it
more conducive to bacterial
growth.

CDC officials are now work-
ing to determine if the ban on

tampons.
TSS can also be contracted

would necessitate ‘‘enormous
outlays of money,’’ Spencer
said, particularly for the pur-
chase of equipment. Burnett
will develop more detailed plans
to lay before the Trustees at a
later date.

Each Trustee also received a
report on admissions, Spencer
said, which shows the College
‘‘running well ahead [of pre-
vious years] in terms of the
number of prospects for the
class of 1985.’’ The report was
not discussed due to lack of
time.

The Board of Trustees will
meet again on February 26 and

The people who participate in
the games, he discovered, ‘‘tend
not to be the sorority or

Eighty-five to 95 percent of
them are male because, Fine
speculates, the games involve
‘“‘typical male fantasies like
picking up a princess and

carrying her off.’’

Compensating for the eroding
effects of inflation on salaries is
largely outside the College’s
power, according to Stair, for
the roots of the problem lie in
the federal government's fiscal
policy. What the College must
do is ‘‘find new ways to get
more bang to the buck,” he
said.

Stair said the College also
needs to bring in more money
through the Development De-
partment. ‘‘We are concertedly
seeking -a vice president for
development who would give
top staff leadership for the 1987
Program and development in
general,’’ he said, referring to
the search for a successor to
former Vice President for De-
velopment Duane Dittman, who
resigned in July.

Increases in alumni giving
are ultimately dependent upon
the College’s making students
aware of its needs while they are
still on campus, according to
Stair. “Alumni giving begins
with. students,’’ he said, “be-
cause alumni are nothing but
graduated students.”

Stair takes a wait-and-s
attitude towards evaluating
athletic policy. Noting that the
College has a new athletic
director and several new coach-
es, Stair said, ‘‘let’s give the
present arrangement a chance.”
He described questioning of
Davidson's commitment to play
Division I-AA football as un-
timely.

Stair is eager to see the
faculty's reaction to the Educa-

coming report on academic pol-
icy. He believes periodical eval-
uation and reform of academics
ensures the College of a ‘‘dy-
namic curriculum.”

Stair does not favor admit-
ting a Davidsonian representa-
tive to Trustee meetings. Since
the by-laws of the Trustees ~
specify who is invited to meet-
ings, Stair said, a change in
procedure would “‘call into ques-
tion’’ present governance pol-
icy.

At last week’s meeting the
Trustees also elected two other
officers. Ben Craig, chairman of
the board of Northwestern
Bank, was elected vice chair-
man, and Larry Dagenhart, a’
Charlotte attorney, was re-
elected secretary.
