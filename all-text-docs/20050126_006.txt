Fishy service but excellent food at 131 Main

By VIRGINIA GREGORY & ANDREW SCHAPIRO
Restaurant Critics

The menu of 131 Main mixes old classics
and innovative twists.

We began the meal with two appetizers,
both of which proved to be far from run of
the mill. The grilled California artichokes
with remoulade sauce were cooked to per-
fection with a healthy dose of olive oil to
enhance their flavor. The salmon with toast
points and aioli, which is smoked in house,
was enough to serve four people and had no
trace of the overpowering fishy flavor that is
often associated with smoked fish.

Above all, the menu explains, 131 Main
prides itself on the freshness of its ingredi-
ents and the fact that everything is made
from scratch.

These high standards pay off, especially in
the entree category. The Baby Back Ribs,
like all of the pork on the menu, are import-
ed from Denmark, proving that quality ingre-
dients result in a delicious product. The chef
smothers lean meat with a slightly sweet,
smoky sauce, and it literally falls off the
bone.

Our filet, which was equally tender, had a
wonderful flavor that was enhanced by the
hickory wood used in the grill. While we
asked for it to be prepared medium, the meat
first arrived sanguine red. The mistake was
quickly corrected and the meat returned ten-
der and steaming. Pan-fried flounder was
just one of the many fresh fish selections,
and the thin, flaky white fish was nicely
complemented by a crisp, breadcrumb crust.

Servers at 131 Main are extremely flexible

about substituting side items, which allowed.

us to sample some of the more unusual selec-
tions on the menu. The wild rice salad (a
chilled mixture of rice, raisins, pecans, red
onions, and a tangy Indian dressing) was per-
haps the most unique. Its zest was a welcome
change from traditional -carbohydrates, but
the temperature contradicted that of the filet
it accompanied. Furthermore, we were sur-
prised upon receiving the bill to find that the
cost of this special was more than we antici-
pated for a dish with only one side item.

One standout was the tender spaghetti
squash with fresh marinara sauce, which was
a great low-carb alternative to actual pasta.
More traditional choices included a loaded
baked potato and Potatoes Colcannon—a
fancy name for garlic mashed potatoes driz-
zled with olive oil.

We capped the meal with an enormous
slice of key lime pie piled high with whipped
cream and a crumble topping. The tangy
lime filling was nicely balanced by the sweet
whipped cream and the pecan crust was far
superior to the basic graham cracker variety
found cradling many pies.

We were fortunate to be seated upon
arrival without a reservation, though we
attribute our luck to an early weeknight din-
ner. The restaurant was full when we left,
and sometimes diners wait an hour or more
for a table. 131 Main has clearly asserted
itself as a mainstay in the area, particularly in
that it lacks competition from other quality,
new American establishments. Calling ahead

By BosBy DEMuroO

Southern bluesman Corey Harris came out
with his fourth CD, “Mississippi to Mali,” in
November of 2003, looking to study the link
between traditional Southern blues music
and African blues.

The CD is an attempt to convey the link
between these two forms of blues, as Harris
actually goes between Mississippi and Mali
to play with American and African musi-
cians.

The idea behind the CD came from Martin
Scorsese’s PBS Series, “The Blues,” on
which Harris appeared. Harris, an estab-
lished bluesman on Rounder Records, has
released three other CDs up to this point, in
addition to embarking on a tour with Ben
Harper.

Harris plays on this CD with famous
African musicians such as Ali Farka Toure
(considered the father of Malian blues), as
well as Sam Carr, Bobby Rush, and Sharde
Thomas.

Thomas is a 12-year-old fife and drum
player and the granddaughter of African
blues legend Otha Turner. Turner passed
away one week before he was to record on
Harris’ CD.

The CD has received positive reviews
from critics nationally, citing Harris as the

bridge between traditional Black American _

music and the music of Africa.

The CD itself is somewhat experimental.
Many of the tracks are non-traditional, and
seem to feature more elements of African
music than they do American blues.

Tracks like
“Big Road
Blues,” “Mr.
Turner,” and

“Station Blues”
are reminiscent
of, and contain
elements con-
cerning,
American blues.
A majority of
the CD, howev-
er, is devoted to
specifically |
African ele-
ments of the
music.

Pieces such as
“Back Atcha,”
“Tamalah,”.
“Nijarka,” and

“Coahoma” all the album mixes African and American blues.

contain very

interesting and entertaining elements of tra-
ditional African music, such as the fife, njar-
ka (a one string violin), and various percus-
sion elements.

for reservations: would be wise.

The atmosphere was understated, and it’s
simplicity hinted at aspirations to develop
the restaurant into a chain. Exposed brick
walls, copper oil lanterns, and thick white
molding everywhere, however, relate to 131
Main’s Southern roots.

Overall, the atmosphere is calming with-
out putting anyone to sleep. A sea green wall
with mirrors along it divides the dining area
from the large bar, thus keeping the noise
level bearable.

Many of the lacquered wood tables are
booths and all are well lit amidst a general
dimness, conducive to a relatively private
dining experience. Each table is well-
appointed with a large wooden peppermill, a
metal domed sugar bowl, and a fat peach-
colored candle. Black cloth napkins are a
nice alternative to the standard white. After a
moment’s debate, we determined that the
buttonholes sewn into the corner of each
napkin promote their use as bibs for messy
dishes like the ribs.

While the food and atmosphere at 131
Main impressed us, the-service managed to
make our meal there somewhat unpleasant.
A truly memorable meal relies as much on
friendly and efficient service as it does on
great food. Sometimes, as during our
evening at 131 Main, a server can act overly
intrusive and spoil what was meant to be a
relaxing or intimate evening.

Shortly after a blonde woman had intro-
duced herself as our server and taken our
drink order, a man informed us that he would

taining a relaxing vocal, guitar and “djembe”’
(an African percussion instrument) accompa-

be taking over our table. 131 Main seemed to
have no bussérs, only servers.

While ours seemed well-informed at first,
he interrupted the meal often, unnecessarily
asking us repeated times how our meal was
and if we needed anything else. Our appetiz-
er plates were pulled out from under us, lit-
erally, as we were still eating. Though our
server was kind enough to leave the plate of
smoked salmon until our entrees arrived,
only one of us had utensils left to eat it. By
the time we were ready for dessert, drinks
had become the joke of the evening. One of
our glasses of water was practically taken
out of the hand to be refilled. The server
asked multiple times if we wanted coffee to
“wash down” the key lime pie. He then
informed us that the secret ingredient in pie
was real key lime juice. We could not help ©
but wonder what alternatives exist.

In addition to the items that we sampled,
the menu boasts a wide selection of sand-
wiches, salads, and other entrees. Every
night there are a number of specials, many of
which include fresh seafood. A seasonal veg-
etable plate is also available as a vegetarian
option.

With respect to beverages, there are a
number of fresh-squeezed fruit juices as well
as two decadent dessert martinis. The restau-
rant also serves a decent selection of wines,
many of which can be ordered by the glass.

131 Main is located in a newly-developed
subdivision off Highway 21, between exits
28 and 25.

compilation rather than a natural musical
progression. While Harris himself states that
“the listener must decide ... rather than be
told and led down the path by the narrator,”
this recording seems unclear as to its connec-
tion. Natural musical development or not,
Harris’ fourth album “Mississippi to Mali’’ is
an entertaining blend of music from two dif-
ferent worlds. For blues fans, and even those
who enjoy eclectic music, Harris’s music is
well-deserving of a listen.

Although it is somewhat difficult to, at

first, enjoy the music, a deeper listening to
this non-traditional (by our standards) blend
leads to an enjoyment and appreciation of
cross-cultural connection through music. -
. Overall, Harris’s fourth CD is a step away
from his past and a step towards bridging a
gap across two continents, separated musi-
cally for hundreds of years. As more and
more African musical elements come to the
forefront of American musical culture (and
vice-versa), and this “musical diaspora”
reaches greater proportions, Harris leads the
way.
