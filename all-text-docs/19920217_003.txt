Tel-Aviv Native Akov Speaks Out On Israeli Perspective

By John Murchison

David Akov, a native of Tel
Aviv who attended high school in
Raleigh for one year while his fa-
ther was on sabbatical in the U.S.,
spoke on the Israeli view of the
Middle East today. Akov currently
works at the Israeli Consulate
General in Atlanta.

Akov said that one of the most
important issues to Israel is recog-
nition. Currently, no Arab nation
recognizes Israel’s existence ex-

cept Egypt, which officially rec-.

ognized Israel in the Camp David
Agreements of 1979. Akov said
recognition is important to Israel
as a matter of pride, and that is a
necessary step towards negotia-
tions with other countries. He felt
that if the current Arab-Israeli talks

are successful, more Arab nations
will recognize Israel.

Akov also stressed the histori-

cal importance of the current ne-
gotiations between the Arab na-
tions and Israel. He said that this is
the first time that the two sides
have ever had a real chance for
progress. Akov feels this current
situation was made possible by the
decline of the Soviet Union and the
events of the Gulf War.
Akov said that the decline of the
Soviet Union as a superpower was
crucial to the success of the Gulf
War. Akov felt that when the
Soviets were more powerful, they
would never have allowed acoali-
tion of the U.S.and Arab nations to
form and:start a war in the politi-
cally important Middle East.

Speakers Ask Students
to Use Their "Condom Sense"

By Jeff Oller

The Dean of Students Office
and the campus awareness group
SHOC (Student Health Options
Committee) sponsored a lecture
last Wednesday: given by Kim
Sagur;a workerat ACCESS (AIDS
Coalition of Charlotte for Educa-
tion, Service.and Support) and
“Duke”, a gentleman who is HIV
positive, in conjunction with Na-
tional Condom Week.

Kim Segur started by identify-
ing the four ways to acquire AIDS.
Unsafe sex of any kind, infected
needles, tainted blood transfusion,
and a transfer of mother to child
with either the child being born
with AIDS or being infected with
breast milk. She asserted that
everyone will know someone who
has died of AIDS within a very
short period of time.

Duke is 37, and has known for
about five years that he is HIV
positive. He does not have AIDS
and he is quite healthy now.. He is
a salesman who travels all over the
nation and.into other countries. He
found out that he was HIV positive
when his partner at that time tried
to donate blood and was found to
have AIDS. Duke was then tested
and received confirmation that he
was indeed positive also.

Duke said he has experienced
terrific familial support, although
he does notadvertise thatheis HIV
positive. Duke asserts that he has
HIV; HIV doesn’t have him.

~ Inresponseto questionsraised
by the audience, Duke madeitclear
that, while the small insurance plan
that he is under, which services

small businesses such as his, pro-
tects him, many others who are
HIV positive or have AIDS are not
protected. Those that are infected,
he said, are afraid to change jobs
because they might lose insurance,
and their managers might find out

and refuse to continue employing

them.

Both Duke and Kim Segur
stated that it was important to
understand that a victim’s ability
to cope and survive with the HIV
virus and with AIDS is greatly
dependent upon the attitude of the
victim.

Kim Segur said, “‘Attitude has,
I think, a tremendous amount todo
with fighting AIDS.”

HIV can lie dormant for up to
fourteen years, and Duke knows of
a friend who has lived with full-
blown AIDS for over three years
now. An AIDS victim is in danger
of dying from diseases that healthy
people fight off every day. Tuber-
culosis, PCP, pneumonia and the
common cold are among those
diseases. An AIDS patient can be

-.put on a medication called AZT, «

which will notcure thé victim, but
will slow the disease’s process.
ACCESS is a member organi-
zation, which means that the
members vote on all issues and are
not controlled by outside influ-
ences like government. One can
become a member for a $5 fee.
ACCESS was formed to provide
additional help to those who are
infected with HIV and those who
have AIDS. ACCESS works

‘ towards helping those stricken to

care for themselves. Furthermore,

recruiting job somewhat less challenging. In addition, there is the
possibility that marquis teams like UCLA would come to play Davidson
during the regular season to get a look at the site of the Final Four.
The tournament also might lure several accompanying events to
Davidson. In 1991, the National Soccer Coaches Association of Amer-
ica’ssymposium, led by present U.S. World Cup coach Bora Milutinovic
and 1990 coach Bob Gansler, was held in conjunction with the Final
Four. According to‘Slagle, the Intercollegiate Soccer Association of
America has shown interest in holding its Senior Bowl all-star game at

Davidson the same weekend.

Akov also said that the Gulf
War itself was important because
it was the first time Arab nations
had formed a coalition against
another Arab nation. He said that
this was a shock to the Middle
East, and that it caused the Arab
nations toreconsider if Israel is the
real enemy in the Middle East.

Akov said Israel had hoped
that its neutral role in the war would
have brought changes in Arab-Is-
raeli relations. He specifically
mentioned the Arab boycott of
Israel. This boycott covers prod-
ucts made in Israel, companies that
trade with Israel and then compa-
nies that trade. with those coun-
tries. Akov also pointed out that
Israel imports its oil from Mexico,
even though the countries around

ACCESS is working towards
combating the national hysteria
concerning AIDS and AIDS vic-
tims.

Both speakers assert that con-
doms need to be readily accessible
to those in school of all ages.
Condoms are available free, no
questions asked, at the Student
Health Center. Georgia Ringle
points out that, statistically speak-
ing, there are Davidson students
who are HIV positive.

One may receive a free, an-
onymous AIDS test at the Meck-

lenburg County Health Center. A |

person seeking the test does not
give his or her name, but is instead
given a number. It is illegal for a
private doctor to give an anony-
mous test. Confidential tests are
available from the doctor for a
price, or they are free from organi-
zations. Confidentiality is some-
times broken, however.

Both speakers believe that
AIDS is one hundred percent pre-
ventable with intelligence, and that
safe sex is essential. Abstention,
they said, is ideal, but in a real
world, safe séx is necessary. Both
implored students to use latex
condoms with water-based lubri-
cant and to be sure that they know
how to use them correctly. Duke

said, “Sex is not something you |

should have to die for.”

it are the most oil-rich nations in
the world. Akov said although
these changes haven’t materialized
yet, he hoped that there might be
some progress with the current
negotiations.

Akov said that another devel-
opment which concerns Israel is
the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Akov said that many of the mostly
Moslem republics will probably
become part of the Middle East.
Akov felt that these countries will
have to decide between becoming
a secular, pro-west nation like
Turkey , ora more fundamentalist
nation like Iran. Akov said that
this decision would be closely
watched by Israel, since several of
these new nations currently have
nuclear weapons.

Finally, Akov addressed the
issue of the West Bank. He said
that one thing that many people do
notunderstand is that Israelis have
much right to settle there as Pales-
tinians do. Healso pointed out that
the majority of Israel’s military is
a reserve force, and therefore the
importance of the regionasa buffer
zone could not be undervalued.

Akov said that the extra time it
takes an invading army tocross the
West Bank could decide whether
or not Israel would survive. De-
spite the importance of the'land to
Israel, . Akov felt that a solution
could be reached.
