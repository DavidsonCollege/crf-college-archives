Greek Week Activities — A WS
“Not A Howling Success") a

By DICK SMITH
Davidsonian Managing Editor

IFC President Vernon Anderson admitted in a DA-|
VIDSONIAN interview early this week that the past
Greek Week was “not a howling success, but I would
say that it is a definite step in the right direction.”

He went on to clarify his
position, saying that “it is al-
most an impossibility to expect
the fraternities to do a com.
plete about-face in one year.
The promise made by last
year’s IFC to the administra-
tion was made under a good
deal of pressure, you remem-
ber. In many respects it was a
bit unrealistic, but it showed
the right attitude and an aware-
ness of the problem.

“The Council this year
agrees completely with the
promise, and did everything
it could to uphold it, but
strictly speaking, it would be
an impossible task. And in
the same strict sense, we may
have broken our word to the
administration, but as a mat-
ter of fact, it is pleased with
the progress this year, and
realizes how high the goal

Annual Publication
Set For Mid-May

The Quips and Cranks edi-
torial staff will send the final
copy and last pictures for the
1959 edition of the yearbook to
the printers within two weeks.
According to Editor John Cald-
well, a date of publication by
the middle of May, before
exams, was assured the staff by
a representative of the Observ-
er Printing House of Charlotte,
printers of the annual.

The date of publication is
now completely dependent, up-
on the printers. At present the
completion of the lay-out awaits
only the pictures of spring
sports. At least three-fourths
of the material has already
been turned over to the print-
ers and the first proofs should‘
be received shortly. Proofs of
some pictures have already
been sent by the engraver.

The staff anticipates no dif-
ficulty in meeting the proposed
publication date in May. Al-)
though no definite plans have!
been laid, distribution will.

was set for first-year accom
plishment.

“Much of the noise and ap-
parent ignoring of the IFC
policy was the work of individ-
ual pledge classes, under their
own initiative. We can’t do a
thing about that. I suppose it
might be possible to supervise
every  pledge’s activities
throughout the week,but there
I think we would be getting in-
to a question of school spirit.
After all, much of the spirit we
have is developed through the
fraternities, and to curtail all
activities, constructive or not,
would be a blow to school
spirit.

“t would say that, making
the same progress we have
made this year in, say, the
next two years, we can ex-
pect a first class Greek Week

Anderson stated with no res,
ervations that “The IFC realized:
its responsibility to the school
and to the fraternities. The
members also realized that
questionable situations were
bound to come up, and conse-
quently were on the lookout
for violations .of spirit of the
program, rather than violations
of the letter.

“None of the former vio-
lations were turned in to the
Council; | wilt admit, how-
ever, that there is a possi-
bility that some should have

Montgomery To Initiate
“Great Issues” Series

Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky wired the college this morning
that he would be unable to open this semester‘s “Great Issues Series” as previously
planned. Commitments on the floor of the Senate made the trip impossible at this

time. The Series will open instead on Tuesday, March 24, with Dr. Robert H.
Montgomery of the University of Texas as the keynote speaker.

This is the second and final
Great Issues series of this
school year. The first was ini-
tiated in the fall and was con-
cerned with “Great Issues in
Politics.”

The present series is to con-
sist of three programs. The first
being today’s speaker, a promi-
nent national figure. The sec-
ond is to be a series of talks
by an academic economist and
the third, a debate between a
representative of labor and a
representative of management.

The academic economist
will be Dr. Robert H. Mont-
gomery, Professor of Eco-
nomics at the University of

Texas. Dr. Montgomery will

speak on the subject “The

impact of Science on Cul-
ture’ on next Tuesday, Merch

24, at 8:00 p.m. in the Ball-

room of the Student Union.

On the following afternoon,
Wednesday, March 25, he will

again be in the Union Ballroom
for an open forum and will dis-
cuss the topic of the previous
evening with students and oth-
er interested persons.

Dr. & F. Patterson, Asso-
ciate Professor of Economics,
fermed Dr. Montgomery as
“ene of the most stimulating
speakers that | have heard;
he is very dynamic ... and
humorous yet speaking on a
serious subject.”

On Thursday morning, May 7,
Mr. Edwin S. Dillard, a repre-
sentative of management, and
Mr. Boyd Payton, a representa-
tive of labor, will both give a
short introduction in chapel.
That evening there will be a
debate between Mr. Dillard and
Mr, Payton in the Ballroom of
the College Union. The subject
will be the “Unionization of
the Textile Industry.”

Mr. Dillerd received his
bachelor’s degree from the

University of North Carolina
and eight years ago was made
president of the Old Domin-
lon Box Company. He also
holds many other important
positions and is on the board
of directors of various firms
throughout the Southeastern
area. .

Mr. Payton began working
for the Celanese Corporation of
America in 1926 and in 1936
helped organize 11,000 fellow
employees into a local union of
the Textile Workers Union of
America. He has been very ac-
tive with the TWUA since that
time and in 1953 he was ap-
pointed Southern Director of
that union.

Dr. Patterson stated that he
hoped that Davidson students
and faculty would take an ac-
tive interest in the series and
feel free to criticize and com-
ment about it.

The second mock quiz ses-
sion, simiter to the one con-
ducted by Dr. McCutchan on
Tuesday night, wes set for
this afternoon in Room 310
Chambers at 4:30. This after-
noon’s session was to have
been on a team competition
basis with Charles Chastain
and Bobby Livingston serving
as captains of the two teams.
The first question asked o

contestants Tuesday night was,
“What is the significance of
each of the following dates in
March—March 21, 24, and 27?”
Among other questions asked
in the hour and a half brain
teasing session was, “If you hadi
had a torus for breakfast what
would you have eaten.?” The
answer, of course, is a dough-
nut,

One faculty member, who
asked not to be: named, said:
that he enjoyed the questioning
of the panels on the third go-|
round because, “By then I
knew some of the. answers.”

‘Russia may not be as ag-
gressive now as under Stalin
because they are better off.
They have something to lose
now. You're too quick to worry
about war, my lads."

As he spoke, Attl@e lounged
in an easy chair, his crossed
legs extended far to one side,
his head resting against the
high chair back. Except. when
talking. he puffed incessantly

on a pipe that drooped from}

the side of his mouth.

His comments turned to the
Near, Middle, and Far Esst.

“I was very satisfied with
the Cyprus agreement,” he
said concerning the ‘recent
English, Cyprus, Greek settle-
ment.

“Nasser is trying to diplo-!
matically straddJe the fence. He |

doesn't want to fall under the
Commies or the West.

“| think India has done a
lot since gaining independ-
ence,” stated the Earl, who
was largely responsible in
the negotiations for Indian
autonomy. “They have some
. fine. new schemes and have
managed to do a good deal
in the villages. The energy
that once was centered in an
irrational nationalism is now
being turned into more con-
structive channels.

Attlee then discussed the
British attempts at socialism

“Nationalism is going very
weil but it is a slow process
since there must also be a
change in atmosphere. We
have to progress when we
want it; we go by rule of
thumb, not by a blueprint
laid down by Karl Marx.

“We're doing nicely in con-
trolling the atom for industry.
However, we're not in compe-

hit the moon; we don't care.

On education, the Earl
said, “1 don’t think the West-
ern education should be com-
pletely technological. The
trouble is at first you under-
rated Russia; now you over-
rate her.”

A true politician to the end,
Attlee refrained from givin
his opinions on segregation in
the South and the race riots in
Nyasaland and Rhodesia. He
gasped “Oh, no!” when asked
if he would comment on the
American political situation.
