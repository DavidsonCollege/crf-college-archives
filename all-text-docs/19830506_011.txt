St. Komedus Laughs On Laughing

By BILL BARNETT

I was thinking the other night about Aristotle’s con-
ception of God as “thinking on thinking.” He presents
this view because he considers thinking to be the most
perfect act possible. What if he is wrong? What would be
the ramifications of a God who was “laughing on laugh-
ing”?

Worship services would be radically changed. First,
the minister would read from the Bible, both Old Testa-
ment and New. A typical reading might be Proverbs 1:1,
“Take my wife. . . please!” or perhaps an excerpt from
Jesus’ Monologue on the Mount. Then he would perhaps
have a responsive reading:

MINISTER: “The road to heaven is narrow!”

PEOPLE: “How narrow is it?”

MINISTER: “It is so narrow, the mice are hunch-
backed!”

Then he would begin his sermon. “You know, a
funny thing happened on the way to church this morning

“There would be a huge upheaval in academia. Since
the absence of God is evil, all literature would have to be
funny. Tragic plays would be banned. The sciences
would suffer great setbacks, and math would probably
be dropped all together. I mean, can you imagine trying
to make a fourth derivative funny?

Actually, God revealed himself as laughing on
laughing toa 14th century mystic. St. Thomas Komedus
was expelled from his monastery when, in 1356, he
broke his vow of silence by breaking out into uncontroll-
able laughter. He later revealed the events of the mystic
experience which led to his laughter: “Yea, and then was
I] embraced by the seraphin of the Rubber Chicken, and
was sanctified with marks of the Bunny Ears. Then was
there a drumroll, and a mighty voice of thunder rang out
‘He-e-e-e-re’s God!"”

Of course, as soon as he began preaching his new
theology, the church attempted to excommunicate him.
However, he and his followers were so much fun to have

around that no one had the heart to carry through with it.

This sect grew rapidly until it was dealt an almost
fatal blow during the Crusades. An entire army of
Komedians were wiped out in a single blow. During
prayer before their first big battle, they laughed so hard
they fell off their horses and were massacred by the in-
fidels.

Their influence lingered on for a while. Tales were
told of how they had laughed in the face of danger, and
an attempt was made to replace the gargoyles on Notre
Dame with clown faces. After this movement failed
(ruled out by the impracticality of painting all that
stone), their numbers gradually decreased. Today, there
are only a few very dedicated members. They hold great
meetings, at which time they try and convert the masses
by sharing their laughter. As their meetings get funnier
and funnier, and orthodox church services get more and
more boring, perhaps they will succeed. Of course, they
never despair in their task, because he who laughs last
laughs loudest, and they know who that will be.
