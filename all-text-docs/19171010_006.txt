The DAVIDSONIAN October 10, 1917

Lyceum Performance
Delights Audience

First of Five Performances Was
Given Moday Night.

From the character of the first ap-
pearance of the Piedmont Lyceum, this
attraction promises to be exceptionally
good this year. Last Monday night the
Kuehn Concert Company opened the
season with a musical treat. This com-
pany, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Kuehn
and two assistants, gave a pleasing per-
formance of classical music, both instru-
mental and vocal. Especially pleasing
was the singing of old familiar songs
such as “I Am Roaming,” “Suwane
River.” “My Old Kentucky Home.”
Mr. Kuehn at the violin was unusually
able in his plaving, while his wife proved
herself a capable and talented pianist.
The singing also was good, Miss Bergh
possessing a clear and cultivated sopran:
voice.

This attraction was one of the highes‘
class on the lyceum circuit, and David-
son music lovers were indeed fortunate
in hearing the concert. A large crowd
greeted the performers. ;

One interesting fact about the per-
sonnel of the company is that one mem-
ber is a German, another a Canadian, a
third a Pole, and‘a fourth an American

This is the first of five performances.
A second will be given at an early date.

MAGAZINE SOON
TO COME OUT

The Magazine is not dead. Despite
reports that the Magazine would be dis-
continued, the editor is at work on a
forthcoming issue, and looks for a better
Magazine this year than ever before.
The first issue will come out the early
part of next month. All contributions
to this issue should be handed in as near
October 15 as is possible. Especially
does the editor wish to urge all men
with an aptitude for writing, and par-
ticularly Freshmen who are interested
in this kind of work, to write something
for the Magazine.

The Magazine this year has two aims
in view: first, to increase the life and
variety of its contributions; and second,
to interest more men in writing for the
Magazine. Under the first head the
Magazine intends to introduce several
new departments. One of these will
probably be devoted to short sketches and
dialogues of a few hundred words each.

Under the second head the Magazine
intends to adopt a plan somewhat simi-
lar to that of the Reporters’ Staff of
Tue Davivsonian. All men interest-
ed in writing will be organized into a
staff, topics for stories and essays will be
suggested, and every effort made to en-
courage the men in their writing. It is
hoped that many men, and especially
Freshmen, will join with the Magazine
in this endeavor. If you are interested.
