Jackson’s disp
nonliteral experience in art

By JAYNE REICH
Staff Writer

Herb Jackson treats a show
of his works somewhat like a
novel in which the pieces, like
chapters should be sensed
together as well as indivi-
dually.

His recent prints, drawings,
and paintings are being shown
through December 4 at Dry-
den Galleries in Charlotte. It
is well worth the effort to see
them for the impact they make
as a whole; the show itself is a
work of art.

Herb prefers to call his work
nonliteral as they do not re-
quire any judgmental analy-
sis. They simply call for
personal absorption of the way
in which he has chosen to
arrange his media.

I find the variety of exper-
iences that I.can derive from
his works enhanced by their
subtle complexity.

For instance, in the series of

most recent paintings (inclu-
ding ‘‘Egyptian Spirit’) an
overall covering of pumice
creates most of the movement
on the large canvases. How-
ever, the rich tonal underpain-
ting and occasional appear-
ance of line allow them to be
appreciated from any distance
and in part.

Most of the textured pain-
tings I found more exciting
viewed at closer range except
for ‘“Thalassa’’ and ‘‘Crosscur-
rents’’ which have larger areas
of contrast.

Also ‘‘Mombasa’”’ —a dip-
tych painted most recently
with emphasis on linear form.
I found a more restful piece to
look at with no sacrifice to
depth or impact of its parts.

Herb says he takes discov-
eries he makes from his pain-
tings to his drawings and vice
versa. I find I want to return
to his drawings again and
again because of the conbina-

DOAN MAH AAA AAA,

If the name Frank Bliss was
mentioned to a typical Davidson
student, he would probably think of
the man at the head of an English
class. But Dr. Bliss is equally at home
behind a camera, as anyone can
readily see after viewing his exhibit of
prints currently hanging in the Union
lobby.

He first came into contact with
photography when his children were
young. As any proud parent would,
he desired to record the youth of his
children, but he quickly passed this
“picture taking” stage; now he makes
photographs.

The difference between taking pic-
tures and making photographs is
important to him. Dr. Bliss is no
longer a passive recorder, now he
actively edits and selects not just
what he will photograph, but how it
will appear in the final print. By doing
this he puts his own personality into
the photograph.

Dr. Bliss’ favorite medium is the
black and white print, although some
color work does appear in the Union
exhibit. A self-proclaimed realist, Dr.

estows happiness in film

He often photographs texture and
objects, and the way light affects
them. Dr. Bliss says, “I love. light.”’
The conflict (or the harmony) of light,
and shadow is a dominant theme in
his work. Often, he walks around his

subject several times searching for
just the right angle that will produce
the effect he is striving for.

Sometimes his photographs require
some effort on the part of the viewer
to realize just what he is looking at.
For instance, one print in the collec-
tion appears to be just an empty
sidewalk. Only after looking at it for
awhile does he realize that across the
sidewalk is the shadow of a cross.

For Bliss; photography is. a close-
up art. The pattern or texture of a
small section of bark may be as
fascinating as the entire tree. Many
times the answer to the question:
What is it?, is less important than
the play of light upon a surface. It is
important to him that he is not so
overwhelmed by the magnitude of the
forest that he misses the beauty of a
single tree.

The portrait is another favorite of
Dr. Bliss’. The same sharpness and
contrast that appear in his other work

neath is often a trying task.

tions of airbrush, craypas,
watercolor, and pencil.

Line and shading are com-f

bined almost mystically in the
prints as well, even though the
colors in some of the etchings
seem less personal.

A visit to Dryden Galleries
is a chance to come closer to
understanding developments
in the awareness of the artist.
Herb describes the series as
composed of transitional pie-

ces in which he is looking for

new elements, holding on to
others.

In the ones he calls break-
throughs he discovers some-
thing totally new to be in turn
explored and possibly carried
on into another series.

Go to the show prepared to
look the way you listen to
music. Lie down, nose up to a
painting. I hear that the
gallery keeper will even
change the lighting if you ask.

Year after year, Will Terry

Terry has found that his major
