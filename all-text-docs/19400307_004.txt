Baseball Candidates Begin Drills

Coach Shepard has issued a call for his diamond candi-
dates and preparatory work began Monday for a stiff 20-
game schedule. The ‘Cats will open the 1940 campaign with

a game Saturday. March 23rd, against Clemson. Presbyterian

will*be met on the next Me nday, erskine Tuesday, Richmond
Wednesday, and Colby Thursday, making five games in six
days—a really tough stretch- for early season. The chiet

problem facing Coach Shepard seems to be finding some po

tent sluggers. With Hic te Hand, and Steere, last’ year’s lead-

ing extra-base sluggers, gone, the hitting question becomes a

serious one. The boys who hit will likely be the ones to play.

: Not one of the nine positions is cinched; an open bat-
tle is being waged for each. Either Edmondson or Fitz-
gerald, two veteran iniielders, will probably be at the
catcher’s post this. year, with Cagle and Williams offering
competition. Carter, a lanky soph, and Niven, last year’s
first sacker, will fight it out for first base. Letterman
Hunter and Yarborough, a sophomore, are the leading
candidates for the keystone sack. Owens, another soph,
and either Edmondson or Fitzgerald will be at the short-
stop post. The third base position is wide open. Coach
Shepard will probably shift one of the infielders named
above to the hot corner. The outfield posts are also
big question marks. Verner is the only letterman report-
ing. Bob Smith, Daffin, and Morris are up from the frosh
nine of last year. Taylor and Latta, reserves of last
Spring, will probably see some service. Pitching duties
will be handled by Captain Hayseed Thomas, letterman
Dave McLean, and reserves Reinhardt and Ficklen.

Golf And Tennis

Davidson’s golf team Opens its 1940 schedule with Hamp-
ton-Sydney in Charlotte, Tuesday, March 19.) Then, on a trip
into Florida, beginning on Friday the 22nd, the linksmen tangle
with Georgia, Florida, and Pegram, Jimmy Coop-

Lhe Citadel,

er, and Sharpe are the returning regulars from last year’s
successtul team. The remaining place will in all probability
go-to Abels, MeReynolds-orLryant. However, the four mak-

ing the Florida trip will be:-the low men over a 72 hole qualify-
ing route which must be completed by, Saturday the 16th.
Co- Captains Tenney and Hunter will lead their tennis
team into action Thursday, March 21st, against Michigan
State on the home courts. Friday they journey south on a
four day trip for matches with Georgia, Emory, and Geor-
gia Tech. Tenney, Hunter, Turner, and Shore are the re-
turning lettermen from the crack team of last year. The
leading candidates for the other two positions are Sproull
and Plyler. This spring Davidson’s courtmen face per-
haps the stiffest schedule in tennis history here. Such
teams as Pennsylvania, Virginia, N. Y. U., Catholic U.,
ae and W. & L. wiil be metyon a trip to New York

Spring Practice Action

Coach Chet Chapman and players look on as Ed Hipp and Don
Bell, block Elmer Knoeller in spring football drills. This two on
one blocking is. typical of the work which is being carried on in
these practice sessions. All threeymen are tackles and are counted
on heavily for next year’s edition of the ‘Wildcats. Knoeller and
Bell won their letters as sophomores last winter, while Hipp saw
some service. The drills, which have been going on for four weeks,
will be brought to an end this Saturday with an inter-squad game.

Fundamentals Stressed
This year’s Spring practice has

been devoted chiefly to the funda-
mental principles of football. Block-
| ing, tackling, timing of plays..and
|other small but important details
{have thoroughly rehearsed an ef-
| fort to develop a smooth and well
| rounded attack for next year’s bat-
| tles.

The returning many of last
year's team and the rising of sev-
| eral promising freshmen has helped
to make next outlook far
| brighter than the last year’s team.
| Spencer and Sharpe will take care
of the tailback position for next
year’s team. Both boys have a lot of
experience and are expected to al-
ternate next year. Yoder has con-
tinued to show up well in practice
and will handle the blocking back
position next year. Bolin and Fred-
|ricks have been alternating at the
three back position during Spring
| practice. Lacey, Hackney,.Maloney,
| Shannon, Simonds ‘and others go to
|make up a fast and well balanced
| backfield for next year's team.

Fra 't Tourney
Ends In Tie

In the last basketball game of the
inter-fraternity tornament, the S.
A. defeated the Kappa Sigs
22-12, to enter into a three way tie
for first place with the K. A.’s and
the Phi Delts. Bob Wood and
George Ficklen played best for the
winners, while Phipps and Hunter
were outstanding for the losers.
This three way tie will not be play-
ed off. The fraterity standings end-
ed up in a rather singular manner, .
for after the three first teams there
were five quints tied up in the
second slot:

K. Sigs Lead Bowling

In the bowling tournament, the
Kappa Sigs continue to head the
fraternity competition. In a recent
game they downed the Pikas as
the Coopers combined to roll up 2
high score. There now remain only
three more matches to be played:
the Pi Kapps bowl the K. A.’s, the
Phi Gams meet the Phi Delts, and
the Kappa Sigs bowl the Phi Delts.
The Phi Delt-Kappa Sig match
should prove interesting as both
teams are leaders in the race.

Volley ball as intramural compe-
tition will be started in the near
future. The inter-fraternity and in-
ter-dormitory matches will be alter-
nated, and an attempt willbe made
finish this sport before the
Spring holidays. Meanwhile intra-
mural competition is being cargied
on in the line of gymnastics. Points)
