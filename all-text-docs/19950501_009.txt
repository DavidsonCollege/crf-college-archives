It’

Holt Vaughan

-Holt leaves us with one last, parting sentiment-

s hard to prepare for

Today was a significant day
for me. For you, it probably was
your typical Wednesday: wake-
up, go toclass, and go back to sleep
fora while. For me, I did all of this
stuff until I went to practice, tennis
practice that is. At first, it seemed
fairly normal. I hunted for my
three rackets under my soiled shorts
and socks that hadn’t been washed
for days. I routinely tested the
tension to see which racket was the
tightest. I threw off my mildewed
flip-flops and slipped into my Wil-
son Pro-staff tennis shoes. - I
grabbed my cheesy Davidson ten-
nis water jug and checked for the
fungus growing inside that so of-

ten happens when you don’t com-.

pletely drain it the day before. Jon,
my hitting partner, prances in the
locker room like he always does,
talking his normal smack, and of
course I smacked right back. After
stretching those worn muscles for
the umpteenth time we grabbed a
bucket of balls that we had hit over
athousand times before and headed
down to the courts.

The whole time, I tried to keep
the work-out normal. Jon and I
discussed our doubles foes for the
coming weekend, fed each other
specific drills, encouraged each
other, and gave each other advice.

“Stay down,” he would tell
me.

“Stay down,” I repeated to
myself. Amazingly, even after 16
years of playing day after day, hour
after hour, on that same shot, I still
could forget things as simple as
staying down.

As I hit the same shot again
and again, I eyed the rest of the
team wandering their way to the
courts. Scott, like always, was one
of the first to practice. Today he
was with Dan who must have got-
ten out of his labs early. Then
came Dave, speaking the same non-
sense that nobody could ever un-
derstand. Today it was something
about Mary Baldwin or something.
I don’t know. Then the rest of the
team, one by one, each bringing to
mind a certain individual trait.
Finally, about ten minutes later,
Coach Frank comes running down
with the phone in one hand, bark-
ing orders at Brice with the other.
Of course, we all know that Brice
hasn’t taken an order from any-
body in the 30-something years of
his life.

Today, Coach took special
interest in “Tiny Tony” by hitting
him. volleys on the back courts.
Meanwhile Caroline, the women’s
coach, was running around franti-

cally trying to help set up for the
Southern Conference tournament.
Shortly after, the women start to
meander down. Kimberly and
Nicole are gossiping like always
about some guy. I hear Carrie
mention to the team that she bought
two new bras over the weekend.

“Same old, same old,” I think
to myself.

Today, since it was the day
before a match, Coach instructs us
to practice whatever we want. So
we all separate into our groups and
work on individual drills. Bill is
nice enough to sacrifice his sore
back to serve to me. And finally,
Albie comes prancing down the
stairs without a shirt, immediately
giving me grief about anything he
could think of. Things just don’t
seem to change.

The two hours fly by. Before
I know it I’ve practiced every
stroke, every serve, and anything
else I could think of. I was ready
for my match the next day. Coach
then called us all together, going
over our schedule for the next day.
He tried to scare us into actually
believing we might have a tough
match even though every one of us
knew it was going to be a slaugh-
ter. That’s.our coach, though.
That’s his job.

And then he said, “I’ll see you
tomorrow.”

So, likealways, I gathered my
things, still trying to think of the
immediate concerns like picking
up the rest of the balls. I put a
cheap shotinon Ted, exited through
the gates, and started climbing the
stairs. I was thirsty, soI grabbed a
paper cup from the stack and filled
itup. And then, as if straight from
a great Western flick, I downed the
shot of water like it was bourbon
and wiped the remains from my
mouth with my other hand.

The women were still practic-
ing. Coach was still talking to a

few of the guys, and I was done.

Not only was I done for the day,
but I was done practicing tennis for
my career. It was a humbling ex-
perience. It’s an experience of
doing something every day for your
whole life — something that you
love more than anything in the.
world, something that has helped
form your personality, confidence,
and identity.

Now, someone tells you you
have to stop. You have to move on
to something else. And you have
to listen to them.

It’s something you know is
coming in whatever you do but

then when it does happen, you don’t
realize it until afterwards, or maybe
it’s just that you don’t want to
believe it’s happened.

Sure, life goes on. It’s just a
game, a chapter of your life. I
knew the chapter was coming four
years ago when I first got to
Davidson. I could have told you
what day, what time, and what
place, but I never could have told
you how I was going to react or
handle it. It’s something you can’t
prepare for. It’s just something
that happens.

Alll can say is how strange of
a feeling it is. That last day of
anything is so strange because even
though everything seems so nor-
mal, the same people, same action,
and same scene, you realize that
you will never forget the details of
that day. You will never forget
what the weather was like, and you
will never forget the tension/of
your racket. Your mind takes pic-
tures without you even knowing.
And the funny thing is, you don’t
see the pictures again until months
or sometimes years after they hap-
pen.

That’s when you realize what
life is made up of; just a bunch of
memories of the last times you do
things — even tennis practices.

. Korean radicalism |

In the summer of ‘90 I dis-
tinctly remember a girl asking me
after a nice tennis match on a Sun-
day afternoon, “Is it that bad?”
after hearing that I was from Seoul,
Korea. It was a perplexing ques-
tion, and I was not quite sure how
to answer her. So, almost immedi-
ately, with a dumbfounded face, I
asked her, “How do you mean?”

Until the ‘88 Olympics, Ko-
rea practically did not exist in a
global sense. People would have
heard of Japan and China, but prob-
ably never would have heard of
Korea. Soon after the liberation
__ from Japanese occupation in 1945,
the Korean War broke out in 1950,
a battle symbolic of a typical Cold
War struggle during which com-
munism seemed to be emerging as
athreat to democracy. Then, from
the 1960’s to the current time,
Korea achieved an economic
miracle of rapid growth and indus-
trialization. As the world became
further aware of its existence,
media’s attention mainly revolved
around something as conspicuous
as a mid-day burning sun, the sa-
lientradical student demonstrations
throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

These massive student dem-
onstrations were targeted against
the government and the U.S. as
well. The students felt they had a
duty to fulfill for Korea: to insti-
tute a true democratic government.
. Schools had to close down or pro-
fessors would have been lecturing
empty classrooms. Students, ex-
ploding with anger and frustration,
stood on the streets with bloody
bandannas holding provocative
signs. Roads were blockaded as

soon as the word came out that a
demonstration was going to begin.
Thousands of students waited for
their leader to make his speech.

The excitement, like a chemical ;

reaction gone wrong, mushroomed
rapidly, ready to explode. For the
police, tear gas was their main
weapon instead of emotional. pas-
sion. I remember coming back
from school, when all of a sudden
a powerful stench would hit my
senses. By the time I got home my
eyes would be swollen red and my
throat throbbing in pain.

I could never understand how
those students stood up against that
horrible gas, continuing to swing
their bats at the police, scream their
slogans, and ultimately to carry on
their mission: to topple the corrupt
government. . The radicals would
choke and gasp under the wet tow-
els covering their faces without
ever once stepping back. As the
government’s actions became more
aggressive, the students became
more radical.

In October 1989, some stu-
dents raided U.S. Ambassador
Donald Gregg’s house: Students
throwing firebombs at the ruling
party’s headquarters was not an
unusual event. Their anger seemed
infinite. Their courage burned like
fire not knowing when to stop.
Some took that imagery a step fur-
ther and committed suicide by
lighting themselves on fire, shout-
ing until the last bit of life was left
inside them.

In actuality, however, it was

not that drastic all the time. Per-—

ceptions like that girl’s, who prob-
ably thought Korea was going

through a revolution, was rooted
from the media’s limited ability to
show only the extremities.

Often, people were obstructed
from going to work because of
road blockades by the students
which always caused a chain reac-
tion in too crowded public trans-
portation in other areas that were
not affected by the demonstration.
Nevertheless, although people
frowned at those radicals, they

- never condemned their actions.

The general public, like the stu-
dents, understood the importance
of that “mission.” Korea may have
grown economically, but it never
went through any political or so-
cial reformation.

The government remained
behind its times as a military dicta-
torship which sought to repress
and destroy any opposition. Cor-
ruption among high officials ex-
isted without shame. Forexample,
former president Chun Doo Hwan,
without hesitation placed all his
relatives in high positions in the
government. Park Jung Hee, who
was ultimately assassinated by his
own friend, changed the constitu-
tion so that he could appoint the
electoral college, enabling him to
winelections with 99% of the votes.
Park outlawed any kind of union
activity, or any kind of organiza-
tion which opposed the govern-
ment; a special institution was es-
tablished to lock up all radicals
without any legal representation.
The list of oppression went on and
on.

However, oppression was not ©

bound to last. Through the contin-
ued efforts of the students, other

civilian political leaders, namely
Kim Young Sam (the current Presi-
dent), Kim Dae Joong, and most of
all the strong will of the people,
Korea ultimately struck down at
least part of the corrupt govern-
ment.

It was not an achievement
made overnight like a revolution.
Enduring a harsh and long period
of oppression, democratic senti-
ments steadily grew like a snow-
ball effect to a destructive ava-
lanche of protests which even the

military leaders could not resist. I -

think it is important to note that it
was a steady change requiring
countless sacrifices along with
strong will and determination.
Currently, Kim Young Sam,
the first elected civilian President,
has brought about numerous re-
forms to uphold his life-long prom-
ise to the Koreans. He has effec-
tively established measures to pre-
vent corrupfion. He has proposed
and passed legislation that force
public officials and citizens to re-
port all of their income. Before
there were many leeways for one
to hide briberies and evade taxes.
Kim Young Sam eliminated them.
Inaddition, acouple of months
ago there was a big crack-down of:
a group of tax officials who had
been slipping tax money into their

own pockets. Before, if the police
had found evidence of such activ-
ity, it could have been erased from
the record with a large sum of
money.

Also, Koreans are more edu-
cated to understand democracy.
Before, they did not understand
what were their rights and what
were not. A general notion, “‘cor-
ruption rules society,” had deeply
grown into the Korean psyche. It
will probably take more than a
generation tocomplete that reform.
Koreans, under the threat of North
Korea, had to unify themselves
and many times give up their rights
as citizens to achieve the economic
success they enjoy now. In that
sense, the military leaders had
caused fruitful results for Korea.
There was, however, a valuable
cost to it: Oppression.

What the girl in the introduc-
tion thought was a revolution was
actually a.natural reaction to op-
pression. After its economic boom
phase, it is perhaps time to look
back and correct the mistakes be-
fore making further progress.
Without doubt, Korea has great
potential and it will be interesting
to see how much Korea advances
and what kind of role it will play in
the international scene soon once
their internal affairs are solved.
