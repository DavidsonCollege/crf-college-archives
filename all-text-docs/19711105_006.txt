Pack Topples Booters 4-1;
‘Cats Prepare For SC Finals

By A. W. TURNER
Asst. Sports Editor

With the regular season be-
hind it, Davidson’s soccer team
is now looking toward its sec-
cnd consecutive Southern Con-
ference championship.

The championship game will
be played at the home field of
the Southern Conference north-
ern champion. That team will
le either East Carolina or Wil-
liam and Mary. William and
Mary has a record of 3-7, while
Ikast Carolina }, 7-3-1. The two
meet tomorrow at Greenville,
N. C. to decide who will meet
the Wildcats.

Then the Southern Conference
championship) game will be
piaved either at East Carolina
on Saturday, Nov. 13 or at Wil-
liam and Mary on Friday, Nov.
12.

East Carolina is the favorite
to win, and if the Pirates do,
they will be out to avenge a 2-1
setback at the hands of David-

son last week.

Coach Harry Fogleman is ex-
pecting East Carolina to win,
and if they do to give the Wild-
cats a tough game. “They have
a very fine team,” he said.

Davidson ended _ its regujar
season on a sour note, dropping
a 4-1 decision to N. C. State.

Fogleman was disappointed,
saying, ‘Neither team. really
played as well as it was cap-
able of playing.”

The ’Cats defense made two
costly mistakes which led di-
rectly to the Wolfpack’s first
two goals. Davidson was never
ahead throughout the game.

However, Fogleman was opti-
mistic about the coming cham-
pionship contest. “We still have
a chance to win the big one,”
he commented.

The N. C. State game was a
big one for Davdison, because
if the ‘Cats had won, they
would have been in the = run-
ning for one of the two South-
ern representative spots in the

“A 44-22 in Tuesday's all-star

game.

NCAA soccer championships.

Early in the week, Fogleman
had noted that Davidson would
be among the top teams up for
consideration along with Clem-
son, Maryland, South Florida,
and others if the team could
beat the Wolfpack.

After Tuesday’s loss, there is
no chance that the Wildcats
could get a_ bid.

Fogleman added that he was
very pleased with the turnouts
at the home games.

“We were averaging around
400 people a game,” he said.
“It's really good to see that
many spectators at a soccer
game.”

The Wildcats go into the
Southern Conference chamipon-
ship match with a 10-2 record.
Both defeats came at the hands
of Atlantic Coast Conference
teams, N. C. State and Duke.

The 10-2 mark is one of the
best in Davidson history.

Injuries to two key runners
and a general slump helped to
end the Davidson cross-country
team’s season on a sour note,
and that note is liable to be
the tune the Wildcat harriers
sing in the Southern conference
meet next Monday.

The ’Cats lost to High Point
College last Monday by a 17-38
margin, and according to team
captain Howard Boyd ‘nobody
ran well.”

“The whole team ran_ kind
of flat,” said Boyd, ‘‘and our
injuries hurt us.”

“Joe Shibley has a_ pulled
groin muscle, and Paul Mitchell
has some bruised cartilage in
his knee, and is wearing a
cast,” said Boyd.

Neither runner competed in
last Monday’s meet at High
Point, and while Shibley will
probably run in Monday’s con-

Skippers To Host Regatta

The next major regatta the
Davidson sailing team will par-
ticipate in will be the one they
sponsor themselves.

The Wildcat skippers will
host the SAISA in a regatta on
Lake Norman Nov. 13.

Unlike the past few Davidson
races, this will not be the
SAISA championship. The cham-
pionship will be held at The
Citadel the following weekend.

This Saturday, the skippers
will take on the Lake Norman
Yacht Club in a hometown riv-
als contest. They had intended
to go to the College of Charles-
ton to compete, but were not
able to secure transportation.

The team has not fared es-
pecially well thus far into the
season, racing in only two re-
gattas and placing poorly in
those. They took seventh out of

seven at the University of Ten-
nessee and “fifth of seven at
Clemson.

“We just didn't send our best
men,” said team captain Allan
Lundy. He said the team’s best
skippers were presently Dan
Johnston and Jimmy Hunter.

“We intend to concentrate on

winning out regatta and the
championship,” Lundy _ said,
“the rest is merely practice for
the finals.”

There are not official stand-
ings in the SAISA: the team
that wins the championship re-
gatta is declared the conference
winner,

ference meet, ‘he has lost out
on a lot of practice, and won't
be in tip-top shape,” according
to Boyd.

Both Boyd and cross-country
coach Sterling Martin are pes-
simistic about the ’Cats’ chances
in the conference contest.

“We're outgunned in the con
ference race,” said Boyd, ‘‘and
the only team we really had a
chance to beat--Richmond — is
not going to run, so we. will

probably get sixth place in a
Six-team meet"

The High Point loss finished
Davidson's season with a_ 3-9
won-lost chart, an improvement
over last yera’s 1-14 record.

High Point placed five men
in the first six finishers, with
ticky Bell coming in fourth for
the ‘Cats. Following Bell for
Davidson were Rick Mullen,
Ricky Deal, Howard Boyd, and
Ron Clark.
