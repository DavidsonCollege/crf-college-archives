Mountain Boy!’

{ really don’t feel like writing a straight editorial this
» Week, and perhaps you don’t feel like reading one either.
instead, I'd like to give you an inside look at the people

who work for The Davidsonian (two at least) and how they

go about “getting the story.”
. One of the prime realities of working for The
Davidsonian is frustration. People have reviews; what you
thought would make a great story turns out to be based
on exaggerated rumor; your typesetter passes out giving
blood; and people complain, and complain, and
~ complain.
' {last week was” probably the most frustrating of all.
Things went so badly we were forced to print only 8 pages
instead of our usual 12. And even then we got complaints.
~ . | get a phone call the night after the paper comes out
Thursday afternoon.

“Helio, is this Mark Barrett?”

“Ves. ” ya

“Well, f-— you.”

Thanks. ae

Someone wakes up my roommate, Ne ditor John
Siman, to tell him the same thing m eloquently.

Chastised by such cogent and well-reasoned criticism,
John and | started roaming the campus Thursday looking
for ways to improve the paper. We met pseudo-vegetarian
Laura Perry in the Union, and when she said she wanted
to eat steak, we knew we were on to something big.

The three of us raced to The Davidsonian Action News
Team Mobile Unit (my car), determined to make it to the
Jack’s in Concord before we were scooped by the Update.

Although going into a four wheel drift getting onto
Concord Road slowed us down a little, | had the Mobile
Unit up to 80 before leaving the city limits. We passed our
first car in front of Will’s house.

Already picking up the newspaperman’s -attention to
detail and obsession with fairness but perhaps not aware
of the urgency of the situation, Laura soon noted, “Mark,
don’t pass cars on the double yellow line. You’re scaring
the hell out of me.”

Drawing from my years of experience in the business, |
replied, “It’s pretty safe when you’re going 80. Everyone
else is just standing still.”

After passing about five cars illegally and going by a
car stopped at a stoplight on the right hand side, | was
forced to slow down slightly by Concord traffic. But | had
picked up speed again pretty well by the time we passed a
patrolman parked by the side of the road. The blue lights
started flashing, and | noted, “This is a bad thing.”

The patrolman glanced at my driver’s license, then
asked, “Do you have any idea how fast you were going?”

“No. ”

“Let’s go sit in the patrol car.’

While John and Laura, sure that | had lost my license,
were debating which of them would get use of my car, |
quakingly told the patrolman that | was surely going too

fast, and that speeding was “a pretty stupid thing to do.”

He had caught me doing 55 ina 35 mph. zone.

After looking at my license again he replied, “Are you
really from Cherokee County?” (Cherokee County, my
home, is tucked far away in the mountains of North
Carolina.)

“Yeah, why?”

“| used to serve on the police force there. Haven’t ever
met anybody from Cherokee down here. Do you' know . .

We talked about home for two or three minutes, then
the patrolman said he would only write the ticket as 50 in
a 35 so that | wouldn’t lose my license. | shook his hand
and apologized again, but then we started back an home.
| had mowed his landlord’s_ grass and one of his cousins
was a friend of mine. ©

He interrupted me. “I just can’t give a ticket: to a

mountain boy,” he said.
“By the way, where were you headed?”
“Jack’s.”
“Well, vial missed the turn, go back two blocks and

General Davidson

To the Editor:

I am sure that there are
others, but the only monument
to General Davidson that I

know is at Hicks Crossroads, at _

the intersection of Beaty’s Ford
Road and Brown’s Mill Road
just south of North Carolina
Highway #73.
Last fall I had to climb the
fence to find out what it was.
It seems that it would take

just a little care and a few

flowers to make this an attrac-
tive memorial to the general for
whom your college is named.
Is there no student organiza-
tion that’s interested?

MD Bike-a-thon
& Bluegrass Band

To the Editor:

Have you seen comedian
Jerry Lewis on campus this
week? His message to Davidson
is no laughing matter. Lewis
leads a national fund-raising
drive to find a cure for a wide
range of crippling diseases
under the general category of
Muscular Dystrophy.

MD is primarily a hereditary
disease that causes degener-
ation of the skeletal muscles
and sometimes those of the
heart, eventually resulting in an
inability to walk. Breathing
difficulty often accompanies
MD, and heart failure and
infection usually bring death by
the agé of 30.

MD’s symptoms first appear
in late childhood, but often are
not evident until the late teens
and early twenties. There are
essentially no effective cures.
One ‘of the disease’s most
painful effects is the loss of a
young family member or friend.

Davidson’s SAE’s will spon-
sor a Pride Ride for MD on
Saturday, April 26 at 2:00.
Starting from the Main Street
parking lot, the ten mile course
will terminate at the Lake
Campus for plenty of sunshine

and a late afternoon cookout.
After the last leg .of the course _

back to Davidson, it will be
time for some foot-stompin’
bluegrass music at Rusk house.
The band will feature Elizabeth

‘and Frank Bright’s talented

father, Fletcher, and friends.

ATO Madness

To the Editor: ’

Last night ATO initiate-
ed its Project to Exploit Little-
Known Contemporary Cultures
(dubbed by PELKCC by the
opposition). Each member of
ATO participated by trying to
mold their minds to think and

therefore begin to act like an

undisclosed neighboring cul-
ture. With a few days of
preparedness training after sup-
pertimes behind them, ATO
members donned khaki pants,
relatively expensive pastel-col-
ored sports shirts, add-a-beads,
and make-up.

More revealing than any sce-
nario is the following passage
from the soon-to-be-published
book by the ATO members
called An Index to Little-
Known Contemporary Cultures:
Add-a-beads. 46-50. Unortho-
dox stringings. 78-92.
Top-siders. 46, 50. Marxist
interpretation. 1-14. The essen-
tial breed of cattle. 16-19.
Cheaper imitations. 101-78.
Queens College Visitors. 95.
fold-out. 95-95. make-up. 101-
78. [see also veils. 20. }

More revealing than any dry
index is the following hastily

sketched scenario, written by

our Writer There.

Well, two streakers caused.
Spills were prohibited. The

unusually ATO habit. nap:

kins. bonfire as big as. Make-

up first-time. Unrecognizable
women going in groups of
seven.

Well...Wait:.:What’s this?
Hold on folks. I’ve just been
handed the official findings of
the study group. They follow
this uncut.

Findings: Eating fast, re-
pressing burps, carrying big red
cups, wearing restrictive neck-
wear and clothes that bind.
All this. adds up. To one who
reacted, “I can’t how
people could live like this full-
time.” Another observer noted,

“With running in the nude as

the only release, it’s no wonder.

Well...the music...the horse-
shoes...the whole tribe... Yes
