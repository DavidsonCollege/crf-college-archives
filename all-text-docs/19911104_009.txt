Ten Really
Useful Ways
Davidson
Spends Your
Tuition

Tam genuinely distressed when
I hear people complain about the
tuition costs at Davidson; it ap-
palls me that students can ignore
all the positive changes that the
administration makes on campus.
Every day I am made aware of
another new benefit that students
can €njoy. is 8

Therefore, in order that we
should not fail to appreciate these
changes, Ihave comprised a list of
ten Really Useful Things that 1991
tuition fees have provided.

1) The most obvious benefit
has been the printing of 500 very
trendy and easy to wear CHAL T-
shirts. Not only does Davidson
educate her students, she also pro-
vides them with clothing. These
machine-washable T-shirts were
made available to all students, and
have proved to be the fashion item
for 1991, :

2) To accompany these T-
shirts, Davidson also provided
students witha color-coordinating
bandana, courtesy of the school
laundry service. These cheerful
accessories have brightened the
wardrobe of every student, and

have become a fundamental part |

of the Davidson student uniform.

3) It is so reassuring to realize
the extent that the administration
cares for the students. The provi-
sion of brand-new toilet roll dis-
pensers in the dorms proves this
fact. The “Generation 2 Twin”
dispensers ensure that no unfortu-
nate student’ can ever be left
stranded again because the toilet
paper ran out. I am glad that the
administration finally realized how
serious the problem with the old
dispensers really was.

4) The addition of Kelloggs
cereal dispensers in Vail Commons
has also made life easier for stu-
dents. We no longer have to worry
about having to find the cereal we
want amid the confusion of differ-
ent boxes. Nor do we worry about

The shop, then called the Norton
Brothers, charged 15 cents for a
haircut.

In the mid 1950’s, the name
changed to Norton & Son. Ken-
neth Norton took over the business
in 1969 when his father passed
away, and re-named the shop
Norton’s Barber Shop, as it re-
mains today.

Since that time, Norton has
maintained a steady business in
the Davidson community. Todaya
haircut runs anywhere from $5.50
to $10.

\Norton lives with his wife
Bettye in the country, 20 miles
from Davidson near Landers. They

Norton, are of growing up in
Davidson with the festivities of
Homecoming weekends, studying
music in the old Shearer’s Hall
(now Cunningham Fine Arts Build-

. ing), and watching the marching

pep band parade down Main Street
before football games.

Norton has witnessed signifi-
cant changes in the College over
the years, the most obvious being
racial and sexual integration.
Additionally, when he was grow-
ing up, Main Street had more shops
on it, including six or seven mom
and pop grocery stores, a meat
market, a theatre, and the Barber
Shop.

Director of the Wildcat Club and
member of the class of ‘50, goes to
Norton’s, as do his son Sandy Jr.,
class of ‘73, and his grandson
Prosser.

Norton plans to retire in 19
months. He says he will stay busy
at home working on his hobbies,
which include ceramics, painting,
stained-glass windows, and gar-
dening. He plans to work part-time
ataplant farm and possibly sell his
artwork.

While he does not know ex-
actly what will become of the
Barber Shop, he hopes to sell it to
one of the six barbers in Davidson
to carry on the business.

To Transfer or Not To Transfer?
A Freshwoman Ponders The Question

By Anna Watkins |
Lately, it has come to my at-
tention that many students’ have
been considering transferring to
another school. A large majority of
these possible transferees are fresh-
men, To what extent and how seri-
ous these contemplations are, I’m
not sure, but the fantasy of student
life at another school is calming
and comforting to some students,
especially to the freshpeople.
~ I, myself, have had this school
switching itch. On a short term
basis, going to an easier; less-pres-
suring school seems like a dream,
the perfect life, especially after
talking to my friends at Emory in
Atlanta, UGA, and Duke. I just
love hearing them say how they
are going out every night, hardly
ever have homework (one hour per
day being an imposition), and are
almost making straight A’s.
No, I don’t want to compare
GPA’s, and I must be the only one
of my friends who parties almost
less at college than I did at home.
The parties and social life are cool
here, but it would be very difficult
to party a lot with no worries.

What happened to the Animal
House type of college life? At this
point, that self-disciplined, you-
know-better-than-that side of me,
the side that probably got me here
in the first place, speaks up and
reminds me to think of life after
college. What does the ‘afterlife’
hold for me? Do I really need to go
to parties? (Do I need to get a
life?!?) Does it really matter if my
friends never know how hard I
work? :
This question brings us to
another rather egotistical worry--
How well-known is Davidson? I
probably wouldn’t have known
about Davidson if my grandfather
had not attended school here. My
friends’ schools are well-known
academically or at tedst socially.

Now don’t get me wrong;
Davidsonisexcellentand surpasses
mostschools, butIcan’tignore the
fact that lam bothered when some-
one presumes that Davidson is a
two-year junior college in thenorth
Georgiamountains. (Those people
are ignorant, right?) My irritation
is soothed, though, when people
who know Davidsanare (naturally)

impressed with my Davidson de-
termination.
Another not so academic as-

" pect of the stress factor here is the

size of the student body. This again

is more of a ‘freshman thing,’ for
we freshmen are just now realizing
that almost everyone looks famil-
iar, and there is not really anyone
who we haven’t met, heard about,
orseen, yet. This factcan be irritat-
ing socially and romantically.

If one has a good(?) weekend
that consisted of a few late night or
drunken follies, almost the entire
campus will know some version of
one’s weekend frolic. This game
of gossip can be embarrassing to
many.

The small size here also leads
to the high percentage of students
who retain their HTH’s, home-
town honeys. (I'll write about the
HTH factor another time.)

Davidson’s size does have
good attributes, though. The small
class size is a given plus in the
academic area. Inaddition socially,
groups cannot afford to be exclu-

Illicit Body

Movement at Night

Things like this happened at
Davidson. Even though the charter
did not prohibit such actions, the
Presbyterian Church did and so
frowned the Trustees. Yet, frowns
and sins hindered the students little.

Perhaps ithappened something
like this:

One person had the idea, and
needing the expertise of others,
slipped the idea to another and to
another until word had crept to all
of the reliable people. The Com-
mencement Hall in Old Chambers
would fiteveryone. Yes, that would
do. But we will need wax for the
floors. Yes, and light as well. It is
agreed then? Nightfall.

And then they would split to
their respective charges. Some for
wax and some for certain instru-
ments headed for their rooms. A
group of students waited patiently
until the horizon veiled the sun,
then headed outside. There, one
found the policeman and engaged
him in conversation. The others
went down Main Street, “bor-
rowed” the six tops of the oil street
lamps, gave a loud whistle to the
diverter, and slinked back to Cham-
bers. No wax?. Well, cornmeal.

That. will do, I presume.

And while two students acting
as natural as snow in summer
watched for faculty, the sin began.
Ladies were ushered in, the oil
lamps were lit, the floor was corn-
mealed, the instruments tuned, and
the Underground dancing began.

In June of 1931 the Trustees of
Davidson College respectfully
denied the request to abolish its
ban on dancing. They stated that
“The General Assembly which is
the highest court of the Presbyte-
rian Church, has from time to time
made deliverances calling upon its
members to refrain from dancing.
A number of controlling Presby-
teries have expressed themselves
asemphatically opposed to having
dances at the College.”

So, in 1938 the Faculty posed
the question, ““Whatreally is danc-
ing?” They decided that dancing
was Round Dancing while Square
Dancing, though “dancing” wasin
the name, really was a folk art. So,
when one “square dances”, one
does not dance, but rather engages
in art. The first blow was struck.

On December 24, 1943 the first
legal dance was held in Davidson
Town. The, ¥ ictorettes, a club for
ladies, sponsored the dance in the
High School Gym for the Air ca-
dets.

April of 1944 was the first
Davidson College sponsored dance
in the same High School Gym. On
February 9, 1945 the Alumni
Gymnasium, now the College
Union, marked the spot where the
students of Davidson College took
those first legal dance steps to-
gether. And what the College has
joined together, let no one make

asunder.
