Dr. Tong's new book provides two-
sided view of reproductive rights

By Randy Hartwell

Few topics provoke such
fierce debate as the deeply per-
sonal issue of reproductive rights,
but Dr. Rosemarie Tong,
Davidson's Samuel E. and Mary
W. Thatcher Professor of Medical
Humanities and Professor of Phi-
losophy, has jumped right into this
heated subject with her new book,
Controlling Our Reproductive
Destiny: A Technological and
Philosophical Perspective.

Co-authored by Williams Col-
lege biochemist Larry Kaplan,
Controlling Our Reproductive
Destiny explores froma scientific
viewpoint the wide range of pro-
creative and/or contraceptive pro-
cedures currently available, includ-
ing artificial insemination, abor-
tion, in vitro fertilization, and ster-
ilization. It then philosophically

examines each option's inevitable
social, legal, and ethical ramifica-
tions.

Tong says her latest book is
the result of “an attempt to bring
humanists and scientists together
to understand each other’s
mindsets.” She says that her par-
ticular situation inco-authoring this
book “was interesting, with
(Kaplan), a conservative Jewish
male, and me, a feminist philoso-
pher female—our differences pro-
vided a system of checks and bal-
ances for each other.”

Tong hopes that the book will
aid in solving infertility by making
people, especially women, aware
of the many options. However, in
it she warns against relying too
heavily on the new technology;
“It’s a double-edged sword,” she
says. She and her colleague deter-

mine that the various break-
throughs do indeed “increase hu-
man freedom and well-being,” but
itis only through constant reevalu-
ation on both scientific and philo-
sophic levels that they will truly
benefit society. i
_ Tong is also the author of
Women, Sex, and the Law, Femi-
nist Thought, Feminine and Femi-
nist Ethics, and Ethics in Policy
Analysis. Controlling Our Repro-
ductive Destiny is currently avail-
able from M.LT. Press.

Natural Born Killers succeeds in unlocking the beast within our minds

NBK continued from page 8

its glorification of criminals to
make money. When Micky finally
kills Wayne Gaye, he proclaims,
“I’m making some kind of a state-
ment about you and what you rep-
resent, although I’m not sure what
it is.” Stone is, though, and gets a
little carried away with his clips of
Lyle Menendez and Tonya Harding
at the close of the film.

On a deeper level, the film
raises some interesting questions
not only about the role of the media

but about the American lust for the
grotesque. It is easy to berate the
tabloid TV industry for its focus on
shocking crimes, but after all, how
many Americans sat glued to their
TVs as the white OJ mobile sped
down the highway, half-ashamed,
yet secretly hoping he really had
done it?

The media is not to blame; it is

simply an industry. As Americans, °

we all niust begiri toshoulder some
of the blame for the violence in our
society. Many of us like to label
criminals as psychotic or insane,

thereby distancing ourselves from
them. Why do nine out of ten mur-
ders in the industrialized world
occur in the U.S.? Do we really
have a much higher incidence of
mental illness? Perhaps there is
some greater malaise that plagues
us all, its symptoms only kept at
bay by our fragile distinctions be-
tween good and bad, us and them.

Natural Born Killers was pain-
ful fozme to watch, not because of
the gore, but because I found my-
self liking the violence. It was ex-
citing when Mallory blew away

ing out in the mud, were spending
the entire time wondering how they
stood on what could be called the
Woodstock Questions — “Should
Crosby Stills and Nash have...?”
“Is corporate sponsorship ruining
the spirit of...?” “If you could have
been to the first one instead of...?”

In hindsight, Woodstock ’69
and Woodstock °94 possessed
some timeless, interesting paral-
lels, most noticeably mud, gate-
crashers, and spirited perfor-
mances.

The extravagantly paid Nine
Inch Nails put on a particularly
wild show, with Trent Reznor roll-
ing about in unnatural ways as he
screamed his song “Down In It.”

On the radio, the term “alter-
native” grew ever more ambigu-
ous as Lisa Loeb’s sleeper hit
“Stay” and Collective Soul’s an-

noying debut single “Shine” got:

airplay until the lasers almost
burned themselves right through
the radio stations’ CD’s.

The surprise cinematic hit
Forrest-Gump- gave rise toa
soundtrack that many could not
resist. Like the movie, the Forrest
Gump soundtrack featured snap-
shot images of the ‘50’s, ‘60's,
and’70’s using such pop classics
- as “Hound Dog” and “Turn! Turn!
Turn!”

MTV hadas busy asumimer as
the radio stations and amphithe-
aters. More than ever, many of the

most popular videos also possessed
some artistic merit.

Soundgarden’s “Black Hole
Sun” provided an apocalyptic vi-
sion of suburban life. “Sabotage,”
by the Beastie Boys, satirized “70’s
detective shows so well, many may,
have found themselves checking
their local cable listings for Starsky
and Hutch reruns.

The most amazing of all was

_ Nine Inch Nails’ “Closer.” Any-

one who has seen its frightening
images of pig heads, sinister old
men, and singer Trent Reznor’s
body spinning in mid-air knows it
is one for the ages.

That video, like the summer
in which it debited, was, if nothing
else, hard to forget.

I was envious. I, too, wanted to
live freely and guiltlessly. As some-
one who supports gun control and
opposes the death penalty, this was
aslightly sickening admission. And
then I realized I had been perfectly
manipulated by Stone. His goal is
not to repulse us by the violence
but to attract us to it so that we
might be repulsed by ourselves.

Dear Terry
Buffington,

"Someone who cares"

Dear Terry,

lama freshman, and I can’t
get along with my roommate. We
come from such different back-
grounds, we don’t agree on any-
thing. Should I try to move out?
Sincerely,
Distressed

Dear Distressed,

A problem at home is the
worst kind of problem. Where do
you go if you can’t stand to be in
your own room?

The first thing you have to do
is be tolerant. Agree to disagree
on some things, and compromise
on things that directly affect your
happiness as roommates (i.e. us-
ing the stereo, ‘bringing. friends
back, sleeping hours.) Some of
your best friends will never agree
with you, but friendship can over-
come that if you look for thé good
qualities in a person.

If you try, really try, to see
past your initial problems, you
will almost certainly find com-
mon ground. If you give it some
time and still are unhappy, talk to
your hall counselor before you do
anything drastic. There’s no point
in making the situation worse.

Love, Terry

Dear Terry,
Twas really insulted by some

to reveal your identity so I can
direct my anger at someone.

Angry,
Concerned Citizen

Dear Concerned Citizen,

Whenever someone criticizes
you, the first thing you should
always do is say, “I understand
you.”

So let me say, I understand
you. You are a “concerned citi-
zen’ with little to do but moan
and complain about this and that.
That’s fine. Laccept you for your
faults, and I would hope you can

with my advice, then write in; I'll
print your letter.

But please don’t waste pen
and paper with destructive rather
than constructive criticism. Re-
member, one suggestion is worth
athousand complaints, you mind-
less prick.

Love, Terry. .

Please write to Terry! Letters
should be addressed to:
