COP OUT TONIGHT

‘Pistol Packing...
Eveready Eye’

By I. V. LEEG
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Edgar N. Linker is his name.
For nearly two decades his wisdom and insight has
consoled, counseled, and protected the Davidson gentle-

man; but—

Three times a year he be-
comes an ominous voice behind
a flashlight—tonight is one of
these times. No bush, shrub
(thorny or plain), tree (tall or
short), football field, baseball
diamond, deer path, or tennis
court (clay or grass), will escape
his vigilance: take notice all ye
“levers of the great out-of-
doors.”

Preceded only~by the warm
glow of his pipe. he will be ser-
ving notice on all who tend to
hesitate in one place too long
(“Now we don't want you folks
to catch pneumonia. do we?")

Later, sitting high in the
watehman's truck he will meet
the resourcefulness of the
Anglo-Saxon male with the good
humor and sharp wit that
dominates his character.

More than one “stalled” car,
in former weekends, has been
activated by a puckish push from
his pick-up.

Why all. this violent suppres-
sion? “Well—for one thing,
there's hardly space for the;

empty cars to park, much less
the other kind—if you see what
I mean?”

Good luck hunter and hunted,
may the better man win; but
our money is on the pistol pack-
ing philosopher with the Ever-
ready eye.

Dr. Johnston Favors
"Educator -- President’

“If I had all-power to name a new President of the
college, i don’t know-witu i would uameé.” confessed
Professor Frontis W. Johnston.

“But,” he added, “I. do have a type of man in mind,
{ could pick a man from the people 1 now know.”

‘DAVIDSONIAN reporters in
an interview with the history:

a man: “I could, but I'm not
sure it would be wise.”

Dr. Johnston was asked to
elaborate on what his “ideal!
choice” would embody. He put
two qualifications on the man.

Turning to questions about

concern now is adding a new

COURT OF CRITICS

By BOB AUSTIN
Davidsonian TV Critic

The weight of the western has been felt at David-
son as Have Gun, Will Travel (9:30 Sat.) and The Rest-
less Gun (8:00 Mon.) are rated in first place on the cam-
pus. However, on the lighter side The Bob Cummings
Show (9:30 Tues.) has gained a very large following.

Playhouse 90 (9:30 Thur.) is perhaps the most pop-
ular dramatic show in its dealings with items or plots
that would appeal to the more educated mind. In the
field of the mystery or adventure series, The Adventures
of McGraw (9:00 Tues.) has attained first place in this
category. This program may bz riveled by Mike Hammer
(10:30 Sat.) whose debut was liked by many.

Each of the stations in this area have been able

to secure some of the old favorites for the late shows] ~

thus making them more enjoyable. All in all, Television
can provide some excellent entertainment for the stu-
dents’ free time.

Q@. “Would you accept the
Presidency of the College if it
were offered?”

A. “That’s in the realm of the
purely hypothetical, that’s out
of the realm of probability.
How do you know what you
would do?”

What The Reverend Charles
Lynnwood Brown would dol
seemed evident. He talked very
much like a man with his hat
in the ring.

The questioning took on a
more general nature as two
members of the student body
joined the group.

Q. “What type of man would
you like to see become Presi-
dent of the College?”

A. “A man who would be
sensitive to the intellectual cur-
rents. Someone sympathetic to
educational standards of excel.
lence . . . . appreciative of Da-
vidson College's long connection
with the Church and a Chris-
tian interpretation of world af-
