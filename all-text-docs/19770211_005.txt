The Davidsenian

Littleoffers multi

By LELAND M. PARK

‘Got a term paper on the horizon?
Want a good deal? And have you seen
the ads (certainly not in The David-
sonian!) with the handy-dandy offer
of a term-paper-writing service?
Makes you wonder.,.pause...but then
of course, it is patently dishonest, and
frankly, not what getting an educa-
tion at Davidson College is all about.*
Besides, this ‘‘service’’ you read
about (but of course didn’t consider)
costs mightily.

May I suggest something else to
consider? Did you know that over
$4,000 has been spent getting mater-
ials for every term paper you will ever
write at Davidson College!? and all
you have to do is ask for it...it’s there
waiting on you. This is a rough ledger
sheet on the cost of a ‘‘Davidson
Produced’”’ term paper. The figures
are accurate, not contrived, right
from recent invoices:

Letters to the Editor

Encyclopedia $312.50
(you always read a general article on
your topic to get the overall picture
before narrowing the focus)

Periodical Indexes to locate journal
articles:

Reader’ Guide . $200.00
(volumes for 4 years at $50 each)
Social Science Index $696.00

20 volumes you locate in the card
catatogue probably. cost about $3

- each to process for circulation; does
not include cost of purchase

Cost of purchasing the twenty books
used $323.80
A recent report said the average
book price is $16.19; which is fairly
close to Davidson’s cost experience

Check on a review of a book by a
particular author $110.00

Woman takes stand

To the Editor:

Okay, the decision has been made.
The Council on Campus and Reli-
gious Life has voted to recommend to
President Spencer that Rusk House
be given to the women’s group for an
eating house for next year. Though
I’m opposed to seeing such a house
started, I will try to accept the
decision with a smile on my face and
with as little bitterness as possible.

The issue is no longer whether a
women’s eating house should be
allowed on campus. That has been
settled. Now, a much bigger question
has arisen:WHAT IN THE SAM
HILL IS SELF-SELECTION? By
allowing a group that admittedly
promises to practice sexual discrimi-
nation to open a house on Patterson
Court, the.Council has violated not
only the spirit but the letter of
self-selection. The Council now
proposes to amend the Patterson
Court by-laws so that unisex houses
will be totally legal. That is like
removing the stop sign instead of
ticketing the offender.

Now that the Council has decided
to ignore the principles of self-selec-
tion, I would like to see either this
Council or the Patterson Court
Council draft a new set of by-laws
that will establish:

1. definitive criteria for the
organization of new houses .on
Patterson Court (Must one have a
““cause’’ to start an eating house?)

2.a policy for the admittance of
upperclassmen into eating houses
after the selection process in the
freshman year

3. official regulations for fraterni-
ties and other unisex eating houses in
regard torush, ‘‘encouragenfent,”’
bids, etc.

4. and finally, a definite outline on
the legality of any unisex eating
house to exclude members of the
opposite sex.

Now that self-selection as I
understand it has gone completely
down the drain, I want someone to
tell me exactly where I do stand.

Total Cost of Materials ‘‘Just

I add “‘just for you’’, because while
the materials are for everyone to use,
when they are put together in the
combination of articles, books, re-
ports, etc. to support your particular
topic, the grouping of these materials
is literally ‘‘just for you”. And this
hasn’t cost you a thing; it’s here
waiting on you.

The obvious follow-up comment, of
course, is ‘‘it’s there, but it’s hard to

tuclipnous resources

put it all together.’’ Granted, but *

there is a procedure, a methodology if
you please, which can make this
whole process easy, logical, and
manageable.

The best way to get started on a
project like this is for your professor
to ask the Reference Coordinator, Dr.
Mary Beaty, to give a short talk to
your class on what is available in the
library on the area your class is
studying. She’ll draw up a biblio-
graphy just for your class...which will
save you a lot of gear-up time. All
that’s required is that she be invited
to the class.

Following her talk, it’s a good idea
to start your research with a short
visit with the reference librarian on
duty at the library. Tell her what
you’re writing on, what your focus
will be, and what you have done so
far. The reference librarians are
employed to help you...that’s why
they are there. Ask them to help you.
A brief visit at the start of a research
project can usually save you hours of
time as well as possibly uncover
materials you didn’t know existed at
all.

After you’ve covered these two
bases, you can start researching,
organizing and writing. There are
hints on how to organize the research
material and how to write a paper
easily. Drop by for a visit with the
reference librarian on duty for some
suggestions; or if you want to get up a
group for a ‘“‘term paper workshop”,
let us know. We'll work one up for
you.

The College Library —‘‘
for you?”’—plenty.

what’s in it

Emanon repays loan,
now financially sound

To the Editor:

It has come to our attention that
there is a rumor, as it may be called,
on campus. The rumor we speak of

, concerns Emanon. While it is true

that most rumors, as this one, are
based in fact, it is also true that most
rumors become somewhat bent with
time and telling. This letter is to give
the facts.

Clark cynical about Police

To the Editor;

This epistle is intended as a
warning to all the insomniant
pedestrians out there. On the night of
Saturday, January 29, at 11:30, I was
peremptorily requested to alter the
course of my automobile- specifically
to the side of the road- whereupon I
received a speeding ticket from a
Mecklenburg County Law Enforce-
ment Officer. I had been clocked at 58
mph in a 35mph zone on Main Street
or thereabouts (the kind officer

entered a lesser violation on the
ticket, thereby supposedly rescuing
me from the throes of a suspended
license).

I would gece appreciate using
The Davidsonian as a forum for the
expression of my utmost contrition.
My sin was, I must admit, undeni-
able. I was on my way to the 7-11,
hoping to nail any and all children or
students who might either dart across
in front of my auto or play in the
middle of Main Street in the delight-

ful 12 degree air. (Though the officer
didn’t mention it, I am now sure that
he knew, somehow, of my homicidal
intentions.) Fortunately, I was
apprehended by the Officer before I
could splatter anyone.

Moreover, I gratefully received a
cathartic $25 fine... Duly chastised, I
became convinced, instantly, of the
valuable public service performed by
the Officer in punishing my haste and

malice. In a way, I was strangely
honored that He would take time from
his other Duties to set me straight...

I have since regained control of my
moral sensibilities, and have realized
the importance of more responsible
driving habits in the tricky midnight
Davidson traffic. However- and here
the cavaet comes into play-now that I
have become part of the Criminal
Element of this country, I am
statistically liable to revert to my
former bloodthirsty tendencies. So,
(and this goes for ail of you out there)
if ever you are strolling down the
middle of, or even close to, Main
Street late at night,... and I spot
you,... you may be in big trouble.

I'll be waiting...

The rumor speaks of the financial
situation at Emanon. The facts
concern the same. When we returned
to school this past fall we found a debt
of about $5500. For several reasons
we were to learn of later, the house
was in the red this amount. We
obtained a loan and paid the debt.

For the past five months we have
been in the process of paying off our
loan. Mr. Currie has worked with us
closely and helped us a great deal. We
thank him for his help now as we are
almost finished with our task. By the
end of this school year, sometime in
May, the loan will be completely paid
off and Emanon will be in the black
once more.

One might imagine how such a
financial difficulty could cause diffi-
culties and problems within a house.
It is true there have been cutbacks
this year, involving most aspects of
house life. There have been minor
problems, but for the most part the
effect has been very much the
opposite. The members of Emanon
have pulled together. There is a new
spirit and unity. It is a very
encouraging picture.

We might add one more thing. This
letter is, for the most part, directed
toward freshmen. We remember when
we were in their position concerning
self-selection and had decisions to
make. We hope such decisions are
much easier made when all the facts
are known.
