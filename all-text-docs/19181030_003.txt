“TREATING” AN
EXTRAVAGANT HABIT

Douglass Fairbanks says that the
greatest American evil today is the
“treating habit.” The typical Ameri-
can spends in a few hours in treating
what it takes him three days to earn. It
is all very well to be liberal, he says,
but this is the time to conserve, to think
before you spend, to lend every possible
penny to the government in order to
bring peace again to the world.

“Doug” Fairbanks is a great booster
for War Savings Stamps. He says that
they can’t be beaten as an investment,
but that all patriotic Americans should
buy them for the encouragement it gives
the boys who are doing the fighting.
They must be encouraged to victory and
nothing will keep them optimistic and
feed their American enthusiasm more
than to know that the people at home
are saving and buying in memory of
them. He calls on all good Americans
to buck up, to get together, to put their
hands in their pockets and come across
or go across.

FRATERNITY HALLS CLOSED
FOR PERIOD OF THE WAR

The fraternities at Davidson have
been hard hit by the new government
ruling, that all fraternity houses would
be closed after October 20, and no ini-
tiation of new members could take place
after that date. No meetings are to be
held, except strictly business meetings.
and these not very often. The fraterni-
ties at Davidson are not allowed to have
houses off the campus, and it has been
the custom to rent a hall annually for
their use during recreation hours. These,
however, are now idle, and will continue
so until after the war.

GUARDHOUSE LOCATED IN
SOUTH WING CHAMBERS

The people of Davidson are soon to
witness a new sight—a sentinel walking
post on Davidson campus.

As guard duty is one of the soldier's
main duties, he must learn it thoroly.
For this reason a guard will be posted
on the campus as soon as the rifles come
and the men have learned to use them.

The sguth wing of Chambers’ build-
ing will be used as the guard house. Post
No. 1 will be located around the guard-
house. The remaining posts will prob-
ably run in a circle around the barracks.
No, 2 running from the east side of the
Library along the walk in front of the
barracks to the east side of B company

‘Land off for four.

barracks. Post No. 3 will probably ex-
tend from the east side of the Library
along the road in rear of barracks to the
east side of B company barracks.

Sentinels must memorize the twelve
general orders for sentinels as prescribed
in the Manual of Interior Guard Duty,
and also the two special. orders for Post
No. 1. A copy of these will be found
on the bulletin board,

A sentinel is on duty for two hours
While on duty he is
not allowed to sit down, smoke, or talk
to anyone except in line of duty. He
is in complete charge of his post and i:
responsible for the conduct of anyone or
or near it.

Two sergeants, three corporals, and
nine privates will be detailed for guard
duty each day.
