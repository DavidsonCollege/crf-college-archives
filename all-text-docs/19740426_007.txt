Civil rights activist and comedian Dick Gregory will speak in
Love Auditorium at 8 p.m. Tuesday, April 30.

I have two standards for a
good movie. One is that it
must take my mind off myself
and involve me in itself. The
other is that it must make me
like it.

Richard Lester’s ‘‘The
Three Musketeers’’ passes
only the second half of the test.
As a friend of mine said of a
recent production of ‘‘Much
Ado About Nothing’, ‘‘How
can anyone be mad at a
Shakespeare play in which the
actors throw confetti at the
audience?”’

No confetti is thrown in
‘The Three Musketeers,’’ but

losing sight of the romantic
potential which Alexandre

Damas’ novel has for the
screen, Lester has turned it in-
to an engaging farce.

‘The Three Musketeers 7

He has had more success
with the farcical elements
than the romantic, which
depend heavily upon his
nonexistent ability to direct
actors.

His mixed bag of a cast

(Jean-Pierre Casel, Richard —

Chamberlain, Geraldine
Chaplin, Faye Dunaway,
Frank Finlay, Charlton
Heston, Christopher Lee,
Spike Milligan, Oliver Reed,
Simon Ward, and Michael
York) is probably no com-
mercial compromise on his
part; they are the type of per-
formers he has always liked
Rather surprisingly, Lester
has not allowed any of them to
embarrass themselves, ex-
cept Faye Dunaway, and even
she is not aggressively bad.

beginning to tire of the Big Mac, out
came the Quarter Pounder. The “‘quar-
ter pound’’ is deceptive; simple con-
version makes it four ounces. Still, the
patty is thick enough to be seen without
peeling off the bun, and I enjoy it
almost as much as the crumbly ham-
burgers my mother fixes.

Most people here don't seem to know
it, but there is a McDonald's in Concord
a block from FOOD.

Hardee’s is the most popular chain in

Hardee’s: The Huskee (88¢) has four
ounces of meat in it. So does the Junior,

Belmont. It is more than worth the
drive.

Last Saturday, Frank Farmer and I
went there on a blind tip, and were at
once awed by the line outside. It was at
least a hundred yards long, but unlike
the convocation lunch line, it was

moving.
After 15 minutes, we were
the door, to where the floor
arrangement had all the charm of a
skating rink; all the noise and bustle of
a state fair employees’ cafeteria.
Within the 500 seat dining area, we
were assigned to corral G, stall 6.
Corral G, as in A through M, held more
people than all the restaurants (and I
use the term loosely) in Davidson com-

“‘Whole order’’ plates cost from $3.25
to $4.50, and we made the mistake of not
getting the half order. Out came the
seafood platters, each holding at least a
cubic foot of food - go see for yourself if
you don’t believe me!

In addition to crabs, oysters, shrimp,
and the token scallop, we each received
the following species of fish:

Flounder 2

The film has some won-
derful ies for ac-
tors, but only Simon Ward
among the romantic leads
manages to make good use of
them. Geraldine Chaplin and
Faye Dunaway try very hard
without success.

Among the comic relief per-
formers, Jean-Pierre Cassel is

(Raquel Welch) who can har-
dly believe his good luck. I’m
not sure that Milligan can act
but I laughed nearly every
time he made an appearance.

The film is best for its comic
and decorative elements.
George MacDonald Fraser’s
screenplay contains such lines
as the one which Porthos says
while he, Athos, and Aramis
are running to the site of
another duel: ‘I wish
someone would tell me where
in the hell we're going.’’ And,
when the Duke of Buckingham
becomes aware of the Queen’s
plight, ‘‘Hurry, then. We must
bustle!’ D’Artagnan: ‘‘Come,
Planchet. We must —
‘bustle’ .”” Planchet : ‘Oh good.
I love to bustle.”

The director and his cast
have been richly inventive. Af-
ter Constance escapes from

dow of exactly the right size.

starts to unlace the bodice.
When Welch disappears, he
gives a plaintive sigh and set-
tles back to sleep.

But the film is best when it is
its most decorative. Opening,
closing, and climactic sequen-
ces are the easiest for a direc-
tor to do well. “The Three
Musketeers’’ has a striking
opening sequence of sword-
play photographed with some
sort of trick photography -
