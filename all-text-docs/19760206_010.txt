The Wildcat swim team
trounced the Citadel Bulldogs
56-39 in a home meet yester-
day and boosted their season
record to 3-6.

Swimming coach Pat
Drake, who was very pleased
with the meet, said ‘“‘We had
so many first places, and
everyone had really good
times. I had thought that it
was going to be a very close
meet.’’ Two records were
broken in the contest, and a
number of Davidson swim-
mers bettered personal bests.

Sophomore Mike Knowles
had two first places, in the
1000 and 500 yard Freestyle
events, and swam on the
winning freestyle relay team.

John Frederick, who was also ~

on that winning relay team,
swam to a first place in the 200
Freestyle race and broke his
personal record.

One of the busier swimmers
of the contest, Marshall
Brown won first place in the
200 yard Butterfly and second
in both the 1000 and 500 yard

Freestyle events to set three’

personal best times. Skip
Barkley also broke personal
bests while taking first in the
200 yard Backstroke and 2nd
in the 200 yard Individual
Medley.

Although he only took se-
cond place in the event, Jona-
than Washburn set a new
school record in the 200 yard

Breaststroke at 2:22.3; the.

Citadel’s Miler won that event
and set a new pool record at
2:20.8. Washburn also took

first in the Individual Med-
ley.

The Bulldogs, a young team
with lots of depth, are having
to reorganize this year after a
two year lay off fo Citadel
competive swimming.

The Wildcats lost their last
two events, getting crushed
by Furman’s all-scholarship
team on Friday and barely
losing to Georgia Tech on
Saturday.

Coach Drake, commenting

Tom Miller (foreground) reloads on the firing line

on some of this year’s oppo-
nents, said ‘‘Next year I hope
to get a more competitive
schodule. This year we had
five fairly easy meets and
seven really tough ones; next
season I hope I can reverse
that situation.”

She added that ‘‘Southern

Conference swimming is good’

and getting better. We want
to stay competitive in the S.C.
but we’re also going to branch
out.’”’

Rifle team shows potential
for success and expansion

By WAYNE CROSS
Staff Writer

Although one of the more
obscure teams on campus, the
Davidson rifle team is the
college’s only truly coed team
and probably has more poten-
tial for success than any other
in Davidson athletics.

So far this year the rifle
team has competed in three
matches, winning the first
against North Carolina A. &
T. by a score of 1137-1106 and
then dropping the next two to
William and Mary and the
Citadel, 2470-2578 and 1366-
1190, respectively.

“William and Mary, Citadel
and VMI are our toughest
opponents,” said team coach
Captain Jerry Flannigan.’’
They have a bigger budget
than ours, and more experi-
enced personnel.”’

Captain Flannigan also
pointed out that all 2000 plus
cadets at the Citadel are
required to try out for the rifle
team, giving the Bulldogs the
cream of the crop for their
team.

Captain Flannigan said that
he purposely scheduled three
away matches first because

contests on the road are the
hardest to compete in. ‘This
way we eliminate the away
matches and, in the bargain,
gain experience which should
help us at home,”’ he said.

Ben Simms, Tom Miller,
and Pete Goodman serve as
the backbone for this year’s
team, but Captain Flannigan
allowed that coed Katherine
Whitney was the most im-
proved shooter on the team.

When asked about having a
girl on the team, Flannigan
readily admitted that Kather-
ine required special accomo-
dations when on the road,
which usually works out quite
well. In fact, when the rifle
team was at the Citadel, she
got to stay in a room in the
guest house between a visiting
ambassador and a two-star
general. Katherine is not the
only girl on a rifle team in our
area, but as yet she has not
competed against any other
girls.

The scoring system for a
rifle match is somewhat com-
plicated: each person on the
team shoots at a twelve-bull’s-
eye target in each of the three
positions prone, sitting, and

standing. A shooter gets two.

practice shots and ten scoring

Coach Drake lamented the
fact that, since Johnston
Gym’s diving facilities had
to be removed, the Wildcats
had to forfeit 16 points at
every meet for diving. She
said that she hoped to find
some place for the divers to
practice before a new facility is
built.
points every meet, and neither
do I like asking the opposing
coaches not to take the
points,’’ she said.

shots per target; this the
twelve-bull target. With ten
points per bull and ten scoring
bulls per target, the shooter
can score a maximum of 100
points per target or 300 points
per match.

The team score consists of
the combined five top scores
by the team, maximum of
1500 points. This is the scor-
ing for a ‘‘quarter round
match.”

Captain Flannigan says
that there is an opening for
one more shooter on the team,
as he would like to bring the
team up to ten members.

This Saturday the rifle team
travels to South Carolina
State in Orangeburg. Follow-
ing that isa make-up match in
the Western Carolina Confer-
ence Tournament, and mat-
ches at Furman, ECU, North
Carolina A. & T., the Citadel,
and maybe VMI.

Captain Flannigan is very
optimistic about the team’s
potential. ‘‘The team is very
much improved, and I’m look-
ing forward to the last half of
the season. The way we’ve
been shooting, I think we’re
going to beat some people who
are not expecting to be bea-
ten.”’
