Students on trustee committees?.
SGA President Rosenbach pushes for more representation

By Courtauld McBryde .
During Tuesday’s SGA meet-
ing, President Eric Rosenbach pro--
posed a plan to obtain student rep-
resentation on the Board of Trust-
ees’ Committees. The SGA will
vote on the proposal of a formal
resolution next week.
The Trustee Committees
There are seven Trustee Com-
mittees: Admissions and Finan-
cial Aid, ACD and Educational
Policy, Athletic Policy, Buildings
_ andGrounds, Finance and Budget,
Institution and Advancement, and
Campus Life.
Currently Rosenbach sits on
the Campus Life Committee, and
Vice-President Alison Sabel holds

a position on the Athletic Policy
Committee. Rosenbach conducted
research regarding student repre-
sentation on Trustee Committees
of other colleges and universities.
He concluded that “Davidson was
the only school that did not have
student representation on the
Trustee Committees. You can see
just how antiquated the Trustee
system really is.”
The Proposal

The SGA will propose repre-
sentation on all seven Commit-
tees, but “we'll most likely get
four out of the seven,” says
Rosenbach. The proposal consists
of three ideas: a two-year term for
each student Committee member,

who would be chosen by presiden-
tial appointment; those students’
terms would start i in | January of the
sophomore year; “this J anuary
would start with a junior-sopho-
more combination plan, according
to the proposal.
The future of the proposal

After the SGA votes for the
approval of the formal resolution,
a proposal will then be made to Dr.
Kelton (assistant to the president)
and President Kuykendall.

“T think it’s good for students
to be informed about the Trustees’
business and for Trustees’ to be
informed about students’ business,
but how that is best worked out I’m
not sure,” says Kelton.

Ken Wood to retire after 20 years

By Susan Warren

In order to take a more active
role in preserving the environment
and in helping the community, Ken
Woodis leaving Davidson. Wood,
Director of Experiential Programs,
is retiring after 20 years at
Davidson.

When Wood came to
Davidson in 1974, he was in charge
of the Experiential Programs,
which then included outdoor pro-
grams (now Davidson Outdoors)
and international internships (now

coordinated by the Dean Rusk pro-
gram). His job evolved to include
career options for seniors.

Five years ago Wood renego-
tiated his contract with Davidson
to concentrate on Experiential Pro-
grams, which is what he came to
Davidson to do 15 years-earlier.

The Charlotte internship as-
pect of Wood’s job will be taken
over by Meredith Harris in the
Careers Office. However, Wood
is going to be at Davidson this
entire year and emphasizes that he

has not yet retired. He is still eager
to talk with any student about job
and internship possibilities.

After retiring, Wood says he
plans to travel with the Student
Conservation Association, where
he will go on three month trips to
explore nature, He plans on taking
a “more activist” role in environ-
ment, wanting to be as “alive as
possible.” He describes his up-
coming retirement as” growing
old—with an emphasis on grow-
ing.”

After. the SGA votes, “we
(Kuykendall, Kelton, and
Rosenbach) will discuss all op-
tions to resolve this issue ... we will
endorse whatever seems appropri-
ate,” says Kelton.

The new resolution will be
presented to the Board of Trustees
at their next meeting on October 6

- as an amendment to their by-laws.

The proposed resolution will be
tabled for vote until the next Trustee
meeting in January.

“T am hopeful that things will

. work out with the trustees. I hope

that student representation will start
January even though the students
won’ t officially be members at that
point,” says Rosenbach.

Director of Experimential

Programs Ken Wood

SGA passes basketball court "

Courts continued from pagel

but “what happened in the last few
weeks has not taken away the fact
that people want basketball courts.”
He also says that he wanted to
synthesize everybody’s wants and
needs. He proposed the new site in
an effort to keep everyone happy.
Student Response

Many students are extremely

pleased with the new resolution.
The field on which the courts will
be built is undeveloped, facilitat-
ing construction. The basketball
players will finally have a place to
play, and students won’t have to
give up precious parking spaces.

SGA passed the resolution
with little debate. Junior Senator
Nick Troiano urged representatives
to accept the resolution, pleading
with them not to get bogged down
with details. “It’s a good idea, and
the money is already there.”

Jo Burrows, SGA representa-
tive from Connor, opposed the
original resolution. After the com-
promise, though, she supports the
new resolution: “It’s a great idea
as long as the site is not being used,
and this one isn’t.”

Sophomore class President
Warren Buford agrees. “We have
appeased a majority of the people,
and laid a firm foundation with the
athletic department to discuss our
needs in the future.”

One senior is pleased with the
expansion around her apartment
building. “I would rather look at a
basketball court than pile of mud.”

__ Opposition to the
New Resolution

Some seniors are not so opti-
mistic. Julie Dawson, a resident of
Martin Court F, says that “they
didn’t really ask us our opinion. I

wish that they had told us that this
was going to happen. I guess we
really can’t Judge until they put it
u ”

e Many are worried about noise
and the proximity to the parking
lot behind the building. Senior
class Senator Chad Lloyd spoke
for the senior class during the meet-
ing, asking Rudell to be sure that
the interests of residents of build-

. ing F were recognized.

PiKA representative Bill
Gullan sees the new site as point-
less. The original reason for the
new courts was for people to have
a place to play when Baker is
closed. As of now, the courts will

not be lit, so students will only be
able to play there when Baker is
open ~*~”

He is also worried about con-
tinuing expense: “The yearly
$4500 maintenance is too high.”

Buford, however, encourages
students to talk with their senators
with any problems. “If it becomes
a problem, the SGA and the ath-
letic department will discuss it with
students.”

The Role of SGA

Rudell was thrilled with the
debate sparked by his proposal.
“This is what SGA is all about,” he
says. “After all the dust is settled,
we can be happy that it all worked

out the way it did; and if it wasn’t
for all the debating and SGA re-
search, we wouldn’thave been able
to meet students needs. Hopefully
this will be the first of many reso-
lutions that can directly impact the
students.”

| Outpost,

Cafe closed
weekend
evenings

By Courtauld McBryde

Students are found searching
for places to eat on Fridays and
Saturdays, as Campus Services
decided to close the Union Cafe
and the Outpost between the hours
of 7 and 11 p.m.

In response to the change, the
Union Board formed an ad hoc
committee consisting of Kristin
Richardson, Katherine Ross, and

- Morgan Perry. The committee

came to the SGA meeting on Sep-
tember 22 seeking support for a
plan of action.

A letter addressed to Carleton
Pritchard, Director of Auxiliary
Services, was approved and backed
by the SGA. The letter stressed the
lack of on-campus dining facilities
during those four hours: “Consid-
ering that the house on Patterson
Court do not serve dinner on these
two nights, a large percentage of
the student body is left with no
campus food service.”

The SGA and Union Board
stand hopeful and eager to reach a
compromise with Pritchard. Perry
says, “Pritchard decided that he
was losing money. It’s a sticky
Situation.”

One junior class member
agrees with the SGA and Union's.
‘discontent, saying that “students

should have an dining option on-
campus so that if students are drink-
ing, they don’t have to drive to get
something to eat.” 5
