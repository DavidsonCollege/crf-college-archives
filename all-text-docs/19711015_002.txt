Reflection Pervades

Conservative speakers, liberal
speakers, workshops and _inti-
mate discussions highlighted
Moratorium Day 1971 on cam-
pus Wednesday.

A film and a conscientious ob-
jector workshop kicked off the
day’s activities at 10 a.m.

At 1:30 p.m. on the Union
porch, Ron Young, the Youth
Director for the Fellowship of
Reconciliation and member of
several other peace groups,
sharply criticized the govern-
ment’s reasons for continuing
the war, saying that they “
don’t hold up any more.”

His argument was threefold,
the first being that the Nixon
administration has repeatedly
used the contention that the
North Vietnamese are unwilling
to negotiate.

Young cited, however, that as
early as Sept. 1, 1967, the North
Vietnamese in Paris have pro-
posed peace plans. the most re-
cent one calling for a withdraw-
al of all United States troops
by Dec. 31, whereby an im-
mediate cease fire would take
effect and POWs would be re-

leased parallel to troop. pull-
out.

Secondly, he called the gov-
ernment’s use of the POWs

themselves as a cause for pro-
longing the war ‘‘absurd,” since
doing so only increases their
number.

Finally, Young dispelled the
pretext of American _ involve-
ment as related to keeping the
national self-determination in
South Vietnam, since the Thieu
regime, he said, was “. . . not
a popular government” as seen
by some 50,000 political prison-
ers being held by the Saigon

government.
Michael Thompson, a YAF
representative, spoke in Love

Auditorium at 7 p.m. with quite
a different objective in mind.
Supporting the government’s
Vietnam policy, Thompson _in-

dicated an effort by American
newsmen to discredit American
involvement in Vietnam, a
greater number of anti-war lit-
erature being put on_ book-
shelves, and a general lack of
knowledge by the American
public on the war’s issues as
causing the widespread feeling
of opposition to it.

His personal reasons for sup-
port of the government's Viet-
nam policy were many. He not-
ed the strategic value of the
country in relation to stopping
the spread of Communism, thus
revitalizing the old domino
theory.

Probably his most notable
reason was that the Vietnam
war was not a civil war but
clearly an act of outside ag-
gression by North Vietnam, who
he feared would stage a mas-
sive retaliation invasion once
American troops withdrew. *

Following Thompson. the
principal speaker of the even-
ing, Sister Elizabeth McAlister
of the Harrisburg conspiracy
trial related some of the
more disturbing events of the
government, which she saw as
intensifying.

The first was Nixon himself,
whose wage price freeze and
announced China visit she be-
lieved to be only a ‘*. . . smoke-
screen to put the war into the
background.”

Next came the Supreme
Court, which to her, would
eventually become favorable to
most of Nixon's policies from
his own appointees in that

The two most important prior
ities which she saw the Ameri
can government concerned with
were law and order plus war
and death, and the consequen-
tial loss of various civil liber-
ties in doing so.

“I guess what I'd like to make
clear, is that I am not interest-
ed in overthrowing the govern-
ment, but rather in changing
the attitudes and priorities of
the people,” she said.

the distribution of an eight-page
report on the fee compiled by
Todd Eades.

Eades recommended favoring
the fee with four reservations.
He exempted board fees from
the comprehensive fee. He also
requested that a definite amount
of money per student be budg-
eted for the Activities Fee and
the Social Fee.

He included the stipulation
that these two fees not be a
lesser amount per student dur-
ing the first year of the com-
prehensive fee than in the im-
mediately preceding year.

Senate action added three
more qualifications. They ask-

ed that the definitions of resi-
dent and non-resident students
be discussed and re-drawn.

Student Body Vice President
Bill Alexander indicated that
this definition should make some
provision for the single David-
son student who lives off-cam-
pus.

The senate also specified that
a break-down of fees per-student
covered in the Comprehensive
Fee shall be submitted to the
senate vearly.

Finally, the senate asked that
the administration deliniate the
procedures by which new cate-
gories can be included in the

fee.

Student Body President Dan-
ny Clodfelter then appointed a
committee to meet with John
M. Bevan and C. David Cornell,
the two college vice-presidents.
to discuss the matter at length.

The committee will be com-
posed of Bill Alexander, Todd
Eades, David Foerster, Bill
Ralston, and Bo Phillips.

The Senate By-laws on the
Finance Committee have been
amended by a senate vote to
allow the committee to conduct
its business independently, re-
serving the right of the senate
to discuss the committee’s re-
commendations when necessary.
