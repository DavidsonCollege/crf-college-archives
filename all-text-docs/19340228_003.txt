REV. SPAUGH TALKS
AT Y.M.C.A. VESPERS

Speaker Discusses Three Greatest
Choices in Life

“Mental and spiritual mismating is
the cause of much incompatability
among married people,” said the Rev.
Herbert Spaugh in his address at ves-
pers last Sunday. He added that men
and women should consider their men-

tal, religious and physical relationship)

in marriage, as these three were the
basis of a successful marriage.

Mr. Spaugh is the pastor of the
Myers Park Moravian Church of
Charlotte, and is well known to the
people of this section of the state. His
subject, “Choices,” was of especial in-
terest to Davidson students at this
time, since it was a fitting beginning
for the talks on vocational guidance
which are to begin this week.

Mr. Spaugh talked on the three
greatest choices which come into the
life of a man: the choice of a voca-
tion, the choice of a wife, and the
choice of a religion,

We are here now preparing either
to choose or to follow out our choice
of a vocation. In selecting the min-
istry for a vocation, Mr. Spaugh ad-
vised first, a more thorough knowledge
of the business world. He said that a
young man who expected to take the-
ological training should first get out
into more practical lines of business
and industry. He should acquaint him-
self with the conditions under which
others work and live, in order that he
may have a better understanding and
keener judgment to aid him as a min-
ister. All professions and vocations
should be familiar to him if he expects
to render the most service to mankind
as a minister,

In choosing a wife, Mr. Spaugh said
that many things must be considered.
Both husband and wife should take
into consideration the necessity for a
well-balanced relationship mentally, re-
ligiously, and physically. Mr. Spaugh
spoke from his experience of ten years
as a pastor and one who had been
especially interested in the relation-
ships of marriage. He said that the
first couple he married were soon sep-
arated, which resulted in the plan of
devoting at least an hour to talking
with each one of every couple who
came to him to be married. He sug-
gests books on problems of marriage.
So far, he said, every marriage since
has been lasting and successful.

In discussing the choice of a relig-
ion, Mr. Spaugh did not speak of re-
ligious beliefs and differentiating be-
tween one denomination and another,
but talked of the broader principles
included in all Christian religions. He
contrasted the present-day attitude
which, he said, is expressed by an ar-
ticle in a recent copy of “The Ameri-
can,” entitled “Why Be Honest?” with
the idea so well expressed by the poem
. reading, “Let me live in my house by
the side of the road, and be a friend to
man.”

Many Trees Damaged
By Heavy Sleet Storm

Superintendent—of—Grounds—F,—D,
Hobart stated today that trees on the
college campus had been damaged con-
siderably Suriday night by the accu-
mulation of a heavy coat of ice on the
branches,

All over the campus at frequent in-
tervals throughout the night could be
heard the crack and roar of giant limbs
unable longer to support their heavy
load of ice.

The campus took on a wintry as-
pect as fallen debris and broken trees
littered the walks and lawn. Minia-
ture lakes and pools were formed
everywhere as a result of the heavy
deluge of the previous day. Pipe lines
were found to be clogged and several
walks almost entirely obliterated.

Expert tree men were called in im-
mediately to survey the extent of the
damage and are now removing the
fallen limbs and repairing the damaged
trees, A statement from the treasurer
of the college, F. L. Jackson, reveals
that no insurance was carried on the
trees,

Keys Are Selected For

Pan-Hellenic Members

The Pan-Hellenic Council met on
Thursday, February 22, to discuss plans
for the Bowery Ball and the purchase
of keys for the members of the coun-
cil.

The date of the Bowery Ball has not
yet been definitely decided upon, but
it is certain that it will be in the latter
part of April. As yet there have been
no arrangements made with any or-
chestra, but it is hoped ‘that a well-
known one will be secured.

Also at this meeting it was decided |’

that keys would be bought for the
members of the council. This year will
be the first time that keys have been
bought for the Pan-Hellenic Council.
The keys will be of average size, about
an inch long and three-quarters of an
inch wide. The general shape of the
key is rectangular with a curved top
and bottom. On the face is a Corin-
thian column with olive leaves en-
graved-on-each-side-of it and a“ D” at
the top of the column, “Pan-Hellenic
Council” will be engraved at the base
of it, while on the reverse side of the
key will be the owner’s name and the
fraternity he represents.

Davidson Pastor Talks
At Ministerial Meeting

Program for the Month of March
Outlined

The Davidson Ministerial Band met
Thursday, February 22, with Dr. H.
M. Moffett, pastor of the Davidson
College Church, as the principal speak-
er. He talked on the direct approach
the Ministerial Band should make to
the Davidson students who aren't
church members or active in religious
activities. He expressed the necessity
for a successful minister to have a
keen knowledge of character and
physiognomy, which is acquired by the
direct contact with people. He hoped
that the Y. M. C. A. and the Minis-
terial Band would combine, stating that
both deputations would be strength-
ened,

W. J. Livingston gave the program
for the month of March, in which the
band will hold services March 11 at
Myers Park Presbyterian Church of
Charlotte. On March 18, the band will
hold another Sunday night service at
the Davidson College Church with J.
W. Morgan giving the principal talk.

At the last Sunday night service
held at the Davidson Church, the main
talks were given by E. J. Humphrey
and D. P. Bailey. Humphrey talked
on the subject, “Faith in the Resur-
rection,” and Bailey on, “The Mean-
ing of Christ’s Death.” B. L. Rose read
the scriptures, and A. M. Cunningham
and H. T. Morris played several cornet
duets.

Last Sunday D. R. Brandon, vice-
president of the Ministerial Band,
preached at the First Presbyterian
Church of Gastonia.

Davidson Scouts Will
Organize Relief Drive

The President of the United States
in his address to the Boy Scouts. of
America several days ago asked them
as their “Good Turn” to the nation
to gather up in each community all
the possible material that can be used
in the relief of human want. The Da-
vidson Boy Scouts are now canvassing
the town in an effort to d6 their part.
Edwin Hodge, local scoutmaster, ‘re-
quests the following of the townspeo-
ple: :

Anything which members of this
communty are not using in the line of
household articles, furniture, mat-
tresses, etc., can be placed to good ad-
vantage in the homes of those less
fortunate. All possible material in-
cluding clothes, bedding, and particu-
larly household goods, are welcome.

This collected material is to be
turned over to the proper authorities

advantage -of all concerned.

DAVIDSON THEATRE
TO SHOW‘CAROLINA’

Play Written by Carolinian Will
Be Feature of Week

This week brings to the theater-
lovers two of the best of the current
movies, of entirely different character.
The first, written by a man of Caro-
lina and filmed partially in the Caro-
linas, will appeal to all, and the other
will appeal to those who love fun and
comedy.

Wednesday and Thursday, February
28 and March 1—Carolina

This is the first of the two mentioned
above. Lionel Barrymore and Janet
Gaynor are starred together in it, as
she takes the part of the young Yan-
kee girl and he takes the part of the
proud old Southerner, who meet in
the Carolinas after the war and have
such different ideas. It is the touch-
ing story of the old South, very clev-
erly done by all those concerned, and
it should not be missed. Also in the
cast are Richard Cromwell, Henrietta

Crosman, and last, but not least, Stepin
Fetchit.

Friday, March 2—Hips, Hips, Hooray

The latest and probably the best of
all the funny Wheeler.and Woolsey
comedies. In this they are at the top
of their art, and as for what was said
at the head about this one, I will even

say that I think everyone will like it.
The situations in which they find them-
selves are screaming, and they have
found many new ones to place them-
selves in. There are many musical
scores which are very good, which
would be expected with Ruth Etting
in the cast, Thelma Todd and Dorothy
Lee complete the cast to this comedy,
which should be very good.

Saturday, March 3

No feature has been billed for this
date, but it is probable that “Heat
Lightening” will be added, a delight-
ful comedy.

Monday, March 5Man of Two

Worlds

Francis Lederer makes his appear-
ance to the American public in this
interpretation of Eskimo life. He has
the part of the native helper of the
English explorer, J, Farrell McDonald.
Falling in love with a picture of Elissa
Landi, he returns with the white men
to their country, where he finds life
to be not just as he thought it, and he
returns to his own country. With him
in this picture, he brings Steffi Duna,
from his native Czecho-Slovakia. The
Picture is good, but somewhat unap-
propriate for Lederer’s first appear-
ance.

Spanish Organizations
In Joint Meeting Wed.

Characteristics and Customs of
the Spaniard Discussed

“Spanish Life” furnished the topic
for the program at the joint meeting
of the Spanish Club and Sigma Delta
Pi, national honorary Spanish fra-
ternity, Wednesday night. Fred L.
Smyre, president, presided, and Jack
Williams, Jr., acted as program chair-
man, pro tempore.

Edward J. Humphrey's subject was
“Popular Amusements in Spain.” He
brought out the fact that there seem
to be two main diversions in Spain,
dancing and bullfighting. The fact that
theatrical representations have always
been a popular form of entertainment
among Spaniards was brought out by
the speaker, The Spanish Zarzuela is
the forerunner of our modern musical
farce. Religious festivals are so char-
acteristic of Spanish life that they may
be included in this category.

The topic, “Spanish National Char-
acteristics,” was discussed by Fred Mc-
Phail. He mentioned dignity as the
first chief characteristic. Courtesy was
another quality referred to as typical
of the Spaniard. It is generally con-

ceded that the Spaniard is lazy, but
McPhail explained this by calling at-
tention to the fact that the sunny skies
of Spain are partly responsible for the
languid attitude of the people.

President Smyre announced that he
