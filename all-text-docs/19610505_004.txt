son at the end of this year.

Elliott, after one year at Da-
‘-vidson, will return to the Uni-
versity of Chicago to complete
his dissertation, a theological
analysis of the work. of Her-
man Melville.

“I am excited about being
able to go back because of the
intellectual, cultural, and so-
cial stimulation that Chicago
offers,” he said. Elliott may al-
so accept an assistantship
there to teach a course com-
bining religion and art.

Daniel will go to Winthrop
College next year to teach in
what he regards as a more
permanent position. In return-
ing to Davidson this year, he
replaced Professor of, Philoso-
phy George L. Abernathy,
presently on leeve of absence.

Daniel will be in the philos-
ophy department at Winthrop,
which will be expanded and al-
tered considerably in the next
two years. He will also teach a
philosophy of science course,
which he stated Davidson
should include in its curricu-
jum.

tributed in the particular area
around ‘Luluaburg Station.
where nine of the missionaries
are Davidson graduates.

ly. Presently there are 300,000

By midnight the bar was

12:05 two of the three were
eliminated, and Porter Haly-

son's first King of the May-
hole amid wild applause. His
court consisted of the two
runners-up, Chip Derrrick and
Bob Hartness.

The DAVIDSONIAN was
able to obtain the reaction of
only one member of the col-
lege administration, Cop Link-
er. “I think it’s all right,” he
said. “It gave the boys a

! chance to let off some of the
Spring pressure.” “The May-
hole Dance may be a new tra-
dition,” he continued. “I'll say
we've certainly never had
anything like it before.”

“COLLEGE SPONSORED”

The DAVIDSONIAN was
unable to determine the
source or instigators of the de-

i monstration. Cop Linker, how-
| ever, seems to think it must
‘have been a “College-spon-

sored thing. They dug the
hole,” he observed.

Industrial Dynamics:
Town’s New Industry

By FRANK

STAFFORD

Davidsonion Feature Writer
Industrial Dynamics, Inc. started moving machinery

men,

“We do not manufacture a
product as such,” explained F.
H. Pittenger, manager of the
shop. “This is a job shop. We
give quotations to anybody to
make any part that lends it-
self to press application.” At
the: present time, the shop is
working on an order for the
government.

According to Mayor F. L.
Jackson, permission has
been granted for the shop to
remain in the old post office .
building for 2 period not to
exceed six months. Jackson
explained that ‘the location
was “an institutional area’
which was not zoned for in-
dustry, but exception was
made because the shop “got
hold of a big order.”

Plans have been made to lo-
cate the shop permanently on
Griffith St, which is between
Davidson and highway No, 21.
Mayor Jackson revealed that
plans to extend the town lim-
its to include this location are
already underway, and town
cations for water and sewer
engineers are readying specifi-
line bids. - oo

The shop is independent, in
that it is not part of a larger
chain of shops. Pittenger stat-
ed, however, that it was
owned by a Mr. Twyman from
Detroit, who “does have other

into the old post office on March 31 to become the new-
est industry in the town of Davidson. The industry is a
metal stamping shop, utilizing some four punch
plus milling and casting machines,

presses,
and employing five

interests in a variety of other
things.” ~

Why did Industrial Dy-
namics chose Davidson for
its location? “One of the
main attractions was the
college,” Pittenger said. “It
is nationally known, and has

become even more so re-
cently.” He also explained,
“Phe Charlotte area, from
all forecasts, seems to be the
growing area to get into.
There's lots of water, trans-
portation, climate’s good—
just all the plus factors that
attract business.”

This is the industry that has
been “under cover” for a long
while. Everyone knew that an
industry was coming, but no-
body, (not even Mayor. Jack-
son) knew who it was except
one man who negotiated with
the company. When asked
about the secrecy, Pittenger
agreed that they had ‘“‘been re-
luctant to put out much publi-.
city. Until something exists,”
he said, “talk can produce too
many different ideas. It.is bet-
ter to wait until the fact ex-
ists.”
