W. C. Plunkett, Sophomore:

Indeed, I favor fully this plan for
the use of our gift fund money. We
all give more liberally when we
can see and feel its results. Further-
this plan seems more non-
denominational than previous ones
and we non-Presbyterians
don't feel that we are deserting our

This plan appeals to me more

than any other in the past years.

such a worthy cause. After all
charity should begin at-home.

Bob Elder, Sophomore:

I think that the YMCA has found
an excellent cause to donate the
Christmas Gift Fund to this year.
The building of a community cent-
er and the grading of an athletic
field for the negroes of Davidson
ought to appeal to those who would
rather have their money spent on
something where they can see the
results,

David Vosburg, Sophomore:

In my opinion the YMCA has be-
gun a gift drive that will show
the students where and how the
money is being used. Unlike the
gifts of former years, we will be
able.to determine the benefits ar-
rived from this project. Surely the
students of Davidson College should
back this movement and give to
those less fortunately situated. I
sincerely believe that each student
will give open heartedly for such
a cause. A little help by us will
be a great help toward our com-
munity.
