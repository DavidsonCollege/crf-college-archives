NORTHWESTERN SOLVES
HOUSING SHORTAGES

Northwestern University has con-
sistently postponed action on its
building: needs, beeause of contin-
uing high construction costs, but
the proposed new men's dormitory
and commons was recently placed
on the “must” list in view of the
critical housing shortage for men
students on this campus. At pres-
ent, about 600 men are living in

metal huts erected on various sec-
tions of the campus.

The new dormitory’s bedrooms
have been styled to make maximum
use of storage space, floor to ceil-
ing, with built-in chests and lockers
of light wood to match the ingene
iously designed desks in the center
of the room.

NANCY COPELAND

Veteran Stage Performers
Appear in Supporting Role

Nancy Copeland and Woody McKay, both veterans in Red

and Black Masquers’ productions, are playing two of the sup-
porting roles in the Masquers’ version of ‘‘John Loves Mary,’’
which will be presented November 21-22. Nancy, whe will be re-
membered for her many brilliant leading and supporting roles

in past Masquers’ productions, has
been with the organization for the
last five years. She attended Queens
Collewe in Charlotte where she ma-
jored in psychelogy. Her experience
in dramatics includes not only her
performances in Masquers’ plays
but also one season in summer
stock. In the summer of 1948 Nan.
cy appeared in plays at the Pris-
cilla Beach Theatre in Plymouth,
Mass. In the part of Lily, Nancy is
looking forward to playing her first
character role. Lily is a former
night club performer whose chief
accomplishment is walking on her
hands. She is a proud and somewhat
defiant girl with a sympathetic
strain predominating in her more
relaxed moments. However, when
her cockney temper is aroused,
which is easily done, she is quite
uninhibited in expressing herself.
Appearing in the role of Fred
is Woody McKay, a member of the
junior class from Lexington, N. C.
Woody, a English major takes part
in varied extracurricular activities.
He is manager of the basketball
team, a writer, on the sports staff
of “The Davidsonian,”’ and a mem-
ber of Kappa Sigma fraternity. His
previous dramatic experience ‘con-
sists of parts in several high school
plays and a supporting role in last
year's Masquers’ production, “Ar-
senic and Old Lace.” Fred, the part
portrayed by Woody, is a calm,
non-chalant chap, who has a knack
for getting out of entangling situa-
tions.

- It might be of some interest to
note that Davidson’s charter states
that “it shall be unlawful for any
person... to exhibit any slight of
hand theatrical, or eqiestrian per-
formance, dramatic recitation, rope
or wire dancing .. .”” Thus, each
play presented by a college sponsor-
ed organization has been, in a sense,
itlegal,

It was in the Fall of 1897 that the
first big dramatic, production was
presented on the Davidson College
campus. The play, “The Widow,"
which was sponsored by the Scc
and Buskin Club, was apparently
successful, although no actual re-
port can be found. However, this
precedent was not to remain a prac.
tice. In March 1898, the faculty pro-
hibited further dramatic productions
stating that “for a college under di-
rect control of the Church, ama-
teur theatricals are hardly advis-
able.”

It was not until 1920 that a dra.
matic society became a permanent
organization on the campus. This
society, which was organized by
Professor E. J. Erwin of the Eng.
lish department, was called the
Dramatic Club — six years later
the name was changed to the Red
and Black Masquers. Since then it
has presented an average of two
plays a year. The present faculty
advisors for the Masquers are Pro-
fessors E. J. Erwin, H. T. Lilly,
and C. G. Davidson.

Pensacola Novelist
Visits Sigma Upsilon

Sigma Upsilon, Honorary’ Liter-
ary Fraternity,’ held its regular
meeting on Monday night, Novem-
ber 7, at the Beta Theta Pi Frater-
nity house.

Under the direction of President
John Lyles, routine business mat-
ters were taken care of and the
guests were introduced. The group
welcomed Mr. and Mrs. Robert C.
Palmer of Pensacola. Florida, and
parents, of Rob Palmer, of the Sen.

ior class. Mrs. Palmer is the au-’

thor of several historical novels of
the old South.

Program chairman, Charles Da-
vis, introduced the readers for the

evening, and turned the program.

over to them. Mr. Lacy McLean
presented his essay on various po-
litical platforms, depicting with a
note of sarcasm the “vital” points
of such compacts. Charles Davis
then read his poem “Reverie at
Natchez", a flashback to ol? man
tiver. The next reading was done
in excéllent fashion by Dr, Cum-
ming as he presented a short stony
account of an incedent in the occu.
pied section of Berlin. Dr. Chalmers
Davidson completed the program
with his reading of his own, “The
Literary History of Mecklenburg
County.” Dr: Davidson in this
booklet takes us back to the very
beginning of literary productions
in and around Charlotte. It is well
to note that dignitaries of David-
son College received top priority in
this ‘work which is soon to be pub.

Beaver Club Selects|Neophytes Accepted
Committee to Write |in Eumonean Tryout

First Constitution

This is a significant year for the
Beaver Club because during the
last meeting, it was decided that
the club should have its laws, ideals
and purposes written out and drawn
up in the proper form. As a result,
a Constitution and By-laws Com.
mittee was appointed to peruse the
history of the organization and
draw up-an_ appropriate: constitu-
tion: the first since the founding of
the: Beaver Club. This committee
will be aided by the legal advice of
Professor Pinkney. Several other
innovations were adopted at that
important meeting including the ap-
propriation of a seal and motto. It
was agreed to require monthly dues
of the members in order to finance
a spring function and other activi-
ties. Previously, no dues wére paid
except a two.dollar initiation fee
which was found to be inadequate
to cover the needs of the club. Be-
sides ‘presenting the new member
with thé Beaver Club key the or-
ganization will also include a certi-
ficate of meinbershit, with its gift
to new members.

The Reaver Club has the main
purpose of entertaining visiting ath-
letic teams. Besides this duty, how.
ever, it sponsors such activities as
last year’s Winthrop Day Dance
and Queens-Davidson Freshman
Dance. Annually, the club sponsors
the Senior Auction held every
Spring. A chapel program sponsor-
ed by the Beaver Club will be held
sometime following the Thanksgiv-
ing holidays. The exact date has
not been determined, as yet. The
organization also plans to hold a
clothing drive for the benefit of

European Refugees. This drive has
been a success previously and it is
hoped that this year’s effort will
meet with as great a ‘response from
the student body. ,

Auburn Lambeth, this year’s Bea-
ver Club president anticipates a
very active season for the club this
year which will maintain its repu.
tation as one of top undergraduate
organizations on the campus.

ENGINEERING SCHOOL
INCREASES CULTURE

To provide a broader general edu-
cation for engineering students

Institute of Technology has adopt-
ed new curricula for all its degree
franting departments.

The Eumaneans accepted five
new members, including four

Freshmen and one Junior, into their
literary society last Monday night,
November seventh.

“Chuck” Kirby, the president, be-
gan by leading the members in a
brief devotion, composed: of scrip-
ture reading from the sixth chapter
of Matthew and a short prayer. Fol-
lowing the devotion, roll was call-
ed, to which each member answered
with a quotation from some. famous
writer or orator.

The program then began with
cach of the new members reading
one or more original compositions.
“Death of a House” and “Chainber.
maids” were presented by Bill Trot-
man, a Freshman, Dick Thorpe and
David Adams, also Freshmen, read
their papers entitled “On The Air”
and “Uncle Jeff" respectively.
There was also an interesting short
story by George Bason. “Shorty”.
LaFar, the new Junior member,
read a paper on ‘The  Estab-
lishment of the Textile Industry in
the Southern Piedmont.’

After hearing these — essays,
poems, and short stories the socie-
ty listened to criticisms by Jack.
McClaney, who acted as gencral
critic for this meeting. He criticized
the conduct of the listeners, as
well as comments made by the
speakers. Later followed a discus-
sion led by Hartley Hall, ‘of pro.
grams for future meetings. The
meeting was then closed after a
consideration by the members of
the persons they hope to bring into
their literary circle in the near
future. .

Student Concert Is
Slated Monday Night

A program of music will be pre
sented Monday evening at 8:15 o’-
clock in Chambers Auditorium by
students in the Music Department.
This will be the first of a number
of such programs to be siven. dur-
ing the school year.

Included on the program will be
music for voice, piano, and organ.
The concert will be open to the pub.
lic and students and faculty are in-
vited to aitend.

Students who will perform Mon-
day evening are: William) White-
sides, tenor; Jack Mills, Rob Pal-
mer and Dudley Pendleton, bari-
tones; Perry Daniels and Paul Lav-
erty, pianists; and Henry Bridges
and Paul Jenkins, organists.

‘Cop’ Linker “Tolls The Knell Of Parting
Day” And Then Watches “Jocund Day
Stand Tiptoe on The Misty Mountain Top”

Any night as you go down to the
street you can usually see a group
standing around in front surround-
ed hy a big cloud of smoke, A clos-
er view will show that this cloud
comes from a pipe in the center of
the group and on the other end of
this pipe is the chief spokesman of
the gathering.

If you haven't already guessed,
this is Cop Linker, the campus night
watchman. There probably are very
few students who know him by
any other name but Cop. His name
is Mr. E. N. Linker and he has
served with the college in his pres-
ent capacity for the past ten years.
Cop comes on duty every night
about eight, o'clock, and he can be
found in the vicinity of the street
most any time till five in the morn.
ing.

Anyone up in the late hours wil!
see him making his rounds through
the dormitories and punching his
clock at the stations throughout the
buildings. Light sleepers have sure-
ly often heard him patroling through
the halls in his never-hurried pace.

Cop is one of the most interest-
ing. people on the campus and his
ten years at Davidson have provid-
ed him with many tales to tell. He
can carry on a never.ending con-
versation with anyone who cares to
stop and chat with him at any time.

He’s probably best known by
the late-comers-in who hasten to
gain the safety of their rooms with-
out arousing his attention. Some
have unfairly charged him with
meeting the busses and giving a
breath check to all incoming stu-
dents. Also it has been said that he
checks every car as it arrives back
on the campus. But these are absur-
dities. No onc has ever been stop-
ped by Cop Linker who has not
in some way acted extremely out of
the ordinary.

Another of the chief problems
that he finds is that of subbing for
the campus electricians. Whenever
a fuse is blown someone yells for
Cop Linker to get some lights in
the dormitory,

And then there are the ever-pres-
ent chores of unlocking rooms for
those who lock themselves out and
chasing dogs from the dormitory.
Once last year a couple of muts
were locked in the armory in the
basement of Georgia and were caus.
ing no small amount of racket.
This went on for some time until
someone called the Cop to relieve
the situation.

Cop says the students today are
nowhere near as rowdy as those
who graced the campus before the
war. This might be questioned by
any number of students, and we

can only wonder what kind of crea.
tures those pre-war Davidsonians
must. have. been. He said it was
nothing to walk down the halls of
any dormitory and be wading thru
several inches of glass. It seems
the students thought little of toss-
ing their empty bottles down the
hall at whatever or whomever hap-
pened to come into view — the
stud must have lost a fot of money.
We can also be thankful for beer
in cans,

The campus guardian also busies
himself keeping solicitors and un-
wanted characters off the campus.
There are more of these who wander
on the campus than the student
usually knows about. If any strang.
er cannot show that he belongs
here or has a good reason for be-
ing here, it is Cop Linker who sees
to it that he soon leaves.

Cop is never aroused or riled up.
He manages to keep calm through
all scrapes, and he has pointed out
that in his job this is a necessity.
He has never had any trouble with
a student and keeps his same easy-
going appearance no matter what

happens. ¢-—

If you don’t have much to do
some night, just step down to the
stud and you'll find a pleasant mo-
ment in a session with Cop Linker.

Premedical Society
Kids ‘Core’ Program

Davidson’s Chapter of © Alpha
Epsilon Delta, National Pre-meédi-
cal Society, is expected to Have 4
greatly enlarged program schedul-
ed for this year, President Tom
Jackson stated yesterday. It was
further revealed’ that the society
hopes to have several outstanding
doctors and scientists as guest
speakers and will continue to have
medica’ films twice a month — to
which all premedical students are
welcome. The fraternity also in-
tends to give precuniary aid to the
overseas relicf organization; CARE.

The fraternity inaugurated — its
expansion program by Initiating
sixteen new members in the Science
Building Monday ‘night. ‘Those ini-
tiated were required to have at least
a B average in premedical scholar-
ship. The following men were
initiated into the organization: 5S.
C. Alexander; R. E. Brooks; R.
C, Burroughs; D. E. Cowan; W. A.
Covell; David C. Davis; R. W.
Hubbell; C. W. Hughes; 5S. B.
Joyner; J. T. Monroe; R. C. Pal-
mer, Jr.; Edward C. Parker, Jr.;
William W. Pate; R. B. Patterson;
R. C. Patten; and Eugene M. Re-
gen, Jr.

It was also announced that the
next meeting would be held on
Monday, November 21; at which
time the program and scholarship
committees will be appointed.

Last year the fraternity was ac-
tive,in the Blood Bank Drive
which was promoted by Dr. Puc-
kett and as a result over sixty pints
of bldod were donated by the stu-
dent body. Other aims of the or-
ganization are to promote excellence
in premedical scholarship and to
emphasize the importance of pre-
medical study. Last year this pro-
gram was greatly benefited’ by the
very enlightening talks given by
Drs. Pritchett, Hansburger, and
Staye. It is hoped that many other
outstanding speakers, such as these,
will address the club this year.

Whether Report

Roys, who said it’s never fair
at Davidson? Today, Wednesday,
was the sixth day with no rain.

There are several reasons for
this ideal weather, First, during the
middle of last week. two air masses
of cold, dry air moved into this
area and then a strong high pres-
sure arca supplemented this cool air
with a continuation of the iair skies.

Todav some scattered rain has
been reported in South Carolina
and Georgia but it is not expected
to bring. very much unsettled
weather as it moves northward
across this state tomorrow.

Colder weather with fair skies
will in most probability spread over
this area on Friday and continue
with much the same kind of sveath.
er as we experienced last week end,
