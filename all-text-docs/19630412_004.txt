Gorson’s Speech In Assembly:

Liberalism Versus. Consevati

He was a liberal speaking at a conser ative school of the South. So he paid the

The myth that there is a

FRIDAY NIGHTS: “All the Fish You Can Eat”

They begen to hit Him with
many missiles containing sar-
castic warheads. A Charles:
tonian {real deep South, suh)
spread a brand of Sovthern
sarcasm that hung heevily in
the North Carolina air when
he thanked our damn Yankee
guest for having the solution
of all our problems hese in
the South, even owen prob-
fems such 4&3 “race riofs in
Cleveland have not been solv-
ed.” He then hinted so very
faintly that the Southern cys:
tom of segregation just might
be the solvtion to race prob-
lems everywhere.

But Gorson was joined by a
staunch ally. Jim Monsonis, the
notional secretary of Students
for Democratic Society, and they
‘continued on through fourth
period to yield food for thought
about many topics to go along
with the coffee.

They reemphasized their
test-ban theary under close ques-
tioning from several of the 45
Lo 50 students present. Monsonis
said that the Arms Control Dis-
armament Agency set up under
Eisenhower had evaluated Rus-
stan forces to be primarily of
the deterrentneture rather than
offetsive.

He. also said. “It's to Russia’s
economic interest 10 disarm: it’s
hot to our own; thorefore we
don't. Personally I trust a coum
try or porson when it is to their
economic interest 1o do a thing,”

‘As 9 tinal though? for con-
sideration Monsonis made s
staternent Fhat might shock
most sleepy gringos, “Every-
one agrees there will be o
revolution in every Latin
American country.in the next
decade except possibly in
Costa Rica and Venezuela. The
fact that concerns me Is which
side the U.S, will be on—the
forces of revolution or the
forees of reaction.”

Gorson heiped him point out
that the new governments in
rach country would have only
two power blocs 10 look to for
help, ane that if we did not help
them, then Russia would.

Not everyone. of course. even
after thinking, ean agree with
all of the “Yankee” and liberal
ideas the two guests put forth.
But thore were nevertheless a

- 00d many ideas to be gleaned

from the two.

They may have been liberals

had some secds of speculation

_ HOW TO GET EDUCATED
ALTHOUGH ATTENDING COLLEGE

In your quest for a college degree, are you becoming # narrow
apecialist, of are you being educated in the broad, classical
sonse of the word? —

Thia question is being asked today by many serious observers
~ineluding my barber, my roofer, and. my little dog Spot—
‘and it would be well to seck an answer.

Are we becoming exporta only in the confined aroa of our
majors, or does our knowledge range far and wide? Do we, for
cxumple, know who fought in the Buttle of Jenkins’ Ear, or
Kant's epistemology, or Manck's constant, or Valsalva’s maneu-
ver, or what Wordsworth was doing ten miles above Tintern
Abboy? |

If we do not, we nre torning, alas, into specialiate, How
then can we brouden our vistas, lengthen our horizongs—be-
como, in short, educated? .

Well gir, the firet thing we must do is throw away our curri-
cula. Tomorrow, instend of going to the same old classes, let
us try something now. Let us not think of college as a rigid
discipline, but ss n kind of vast rendemic amorgasbord, with
all kinds of tonpting intellectual tidbits to savor. Let's start.
munpling tomorrow.

We will begin tho doy with o stimulating seminar in Hittite
artifacts. Then we will go over to marine biology nnd spend a
havpy hour with the sea slugs. Then we will opan our pores by
drilling » spoll with the ROTC. Then we'll go ovor to journalism
and tear out the front page. Then we'll go to the medical school
and qutogtnph some casts, Then we'll .go to home economics
and hive lunch.

And between elusses we'll smoke Marlboro Cignrettes. This,
lat me emphasize, ia not an added fillip to the broadening of
our eduention, This is an essential. To loarn to live fully and
well is an important purt of education, and Marlboros are an
important part of living fully and well, What a sense of com-

pletencxs you will get from Moslboro’s fine tobaccos, from

darlboro's pure‘fitter! What Muvor Marlboro delivers! Through
thut immaculate filter comes flavor in full measure, flavor with-
out atint or compromigo flavor that wrinkled care derides,
flavor holding both its sides. This triumph of the tobacconist's
