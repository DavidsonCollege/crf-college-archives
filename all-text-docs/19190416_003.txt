EU. SOCIETY.

The meeting of the Eumenean Lit-
erary Society was held at the regular
hour in the Eu. Hall Saturday night,
April 12. A full house listened with
interest and enjoyment to the speakers.
The subject for discussion was: Re-
solved, “‘Vhat the Rhine River Should
be the Boundary Line Between France
and Germany.”

‘The affirmative was upheld by Bitzer,
Liston, Summers and Bailey. ‘hey de-
fended their side vigorously
principal points: That the extra strip
of land, rightly belonged to France by
conquest; that it would develop the
French resources; that it should be giv-
en France as a reparation for the losses
incurred during the war,

The negative, composed of Robson,
Hyland, Knight, and Long, started off
in excellent. style but their opposition
and argument was smothered during the
latter stages of the debate. They argued
that France did not. need this extra
strip of land, and that it would cause
continued disputes between the inhabi-
tants. The house decided in favor of
the affirmative. The committee did like-
wise.

Lowry ended the exercises by deliv-
ering a spirited declamation on “The
Cure for Anarchism,” by Lyman Am-
mon.

The debate was featured by the sev-
eral misunderstandings and the word
fights which followed, when “Bull” Lis-
ton claimed to be misrepresented. <A
hurry call was sent for “Pitts,” but the
disturbance settled peaceably. Bitzer
proved to be an M. A. when it came
to counting on his fingers, This was
his favorite pastime. Robson was not
on the winning side, but he presented
what seemed to be a funny paper to the
house, which afterwards proved to be
a map. One would think that Summers
was holding a “Royal straight flush,” by
the cunning way he shuffled his notes
when he attempted to take the “full
house.” Although Knight has a dark
name, he turned to a ghastly white from
stage fright while on the floor and it is
hard to tell who proved to be the best
reader, he or Long. The last named
gentleman almost. meets the require-
ments of a Keith comedian. Bitzer, sav-
ing up his energy. blew the lights out
with his eloquent rebuttal. The snbject

by three}.

for extemporaneous debate was:  Re-
solved, That in Japan They Suck ‘Their
‘Thumbs Instead of Chewing Gum.”
The affirmative was upheld by Mr, Cum-
mings and the negative by the acting
president. “lhe affirmative won, and in-
cidentally saved himself a 25 cent. fine.
The usual fines for disorder were im-
posed on the front row for being engag-
ed in a conspiracy to create annoying ap-
plause.

PHI. SOCIETY.

Due to the good work ‘of the Phi.’s
janitor who ran off to Charlotte. with
the keys, this society was forced to sus-
pend action for the time being.

UNIFORMS BEING ISSUED;
RIFLES EXPECTED DAILY

About. half of the cadets were. issued
their full line of clothing, with the ex-
ception of shoes and overcoats, last- week.
Another small shipment came in Satur-
day and a larger shipment is expected
to arrive any day. “The Professor of
Military Science and Tactics was de-
sirous of obtaining smooth russet leather
shoes but the unfinished leather ones
like those issued in the S. A. ‘T. C.. were
sent instead. The shoes were issued
Monday. ‘The overcoats will not be
given out until a decision ‘s reached as
to whether or not the boys will be per-
mitted to keep them. Tf not, there is
no use of issuing them for this warm
weather.

The rifles. with the rest of the ord-
nance equipment, including ammunition,
packs, etc., are expected to arrive this
week,

ANOTHER GAME IN
CHARLOTTE THIS WEEK.

Monday morning Manager Cunning-
ham announced that Davidson had been
asked to play in Charlotte Wednesday
of this week as one of the features of
the neighboring city’s big celebration in
honor of the returning 120th Infantry.
Charlotte will secure the second team
and ix good brand of baschall will no
doubt be displayed. It is hoped that this
team will be Virginia, as this will give
us two chances at the famous aggrega-
tion from the Old Dominion State.

SUNDAY SCHOOLS EXCELLENT
BIBLE CLASS STILL POOR

The attendance of the Bible classes
last Sunday was poor. ‘The first floors
of Georgia and Watts had no meeting
at all. Rumple still leads with an at-
tendance of 29. North Wing Chambers
16, Georgia 13, Watts 13, South Wing
Chambers. 8.

Total attendance at Sunday — schools
was 233 with 19 teachers, “This shows
quite an improvement over last Sunday's
attendance.

SOPH. BANQUET.

The Soph. banquet will be given next
Thursday, the seventeenth, in Charlotte,
at-the Selwyn Hotel. Manager McKel-
din has been working hard on. the ar-
tangements, and has all his plans com-
plete. Thirty-five or forty men will at-
tend. Coming the day of the Virginia
game, an early departure from David-
son is planned.

The banquet should be a very fine af-
fair. Music has been secured for the en-
tire evening. Cop Johnson is the toast-
master of the occasion. There will be a
guest from each class. Professor Reed
will be the faculty representative. The
purpose of the banquet is to bring the
class together and arouse class pride and

‘spirit. All men will be excused from

recitation class the next day.

Dr. Richards Addresses
Y. M. C. A. On “Pep”

A Man Must Be Characterized by
Christian Zeal to Succeed.

Sunday night saw a very good attend-
ance at “Y" vesper service in’ Shearer
Hall. Dr. Richards made a talk -on
“Pep.” He took the illustration. of Joash,
the king ot Isracl in his interview with
the dying Elisha. “Phe prophet told: the
king to smite the ground with his ar-
rows in token of the defeat of Syria.
Joash smote three times, and stayed. He
did not passionately hate the Syrians, as
he should have done, and showed his
lack ot “pep” by smiting only three
times, “This lukeswarimness cost him his
kingdom, So itis with many of us, We

need to be set on fire with a passionate

desire to serve Christ. But how are we
to be set on fire foe him? One kindles
a fire by lighting it from another fire.
Blue Ridge is such a place, where there
are many people on fire for Christ. Uf
there is such a man among the student
body, we should cultivate his acquaint
ance. But there is a far greater center
from whence to get this passion and that
is from Jesus Christ himself. Why not
go to him?) He js always here.

Let the fires in Him catch on to vou.
Don't be like Joash, passionless against
what is wrong: but keep on smiting,
fighting against the evil influences
ardund you. Get close to Christ.

It seems that Babe Sherrill met his
Waterloo m the water battle in front of
Rumple last Monday night,

Probably due to. his disappointment
on the athletic field Sunday night.
“Handsome” Black is wearing a band-
aged hand.

The old adage: “It never rains but it
pours,” was entirely fulfilled list Friday.
Vhe rain came down in sheets, North
Chambers contributing her share, while
classes were cut by the wholesale,
