Then, also, “Love finds Andy

Joe Stukes and Jim Boyce would
appear to be the women haters of
Davidson. It’s O. K. fellows but
it’s surely a lot of fun: learning the
hard way. Now, Alf Scarborough

There is nothing very more ex-

someone would tell Jim Reid and
Ghram McGee of this fact.

that out of 2,000 girls at the W. C.

You didn’t have that much trouble

the shortages of war time, they
thought that it would be wise to go
together instead of each frat giving
a dance by itself.

Eminent Physicians Will Lec-
ture for Matheson Foundation

From the very beginning, David-
son College men have been promi-
nent in the field of medicine. The
first graduating class of fifty-five,
in 1840, included eight men who
went from to Medical
College and later became respected
and honored physicians.

Since that early date students,
in. an unbroken chain, have begun
an education at which
was destined to lead them to this
great field of Since 1886,

service.

courses

There has been’ no time from
that day to this when the college
could not point with pride to her
distinguished sons who stood at the
very front in the practice of medi-
cine. Always she has. striven to
hold before her students the high
ideals of this noble profession and
picture to them the great _opportuni-
ties for service in. this field. It is
no accident that among those who
have benefited their day and genera-
tion in the medical world are names
such as: J. G. Ramsay, 1841; R. L.
Beall, 1851; J. A. Hodges, 1879; R.
J. Brevard, 1867; J. F. P. Robinson,
1876; John Whitehead, 1875; John
P. «Monroe, 1882; J. D. Nesbit; 1881;
W. S. Boyd, 1882; J. M. Faison,
1883; and William F. Faison, 1886.

In later years the number of can-
didates for the medical career has
grown ‘steadily until it represents
the largest group on the campus (in
the normal peace time student body)
committed to any one of the so-
called professions. The kind of, pre-
paration they receive at Davidson
and the standing of Davidson men
in the advanced medical colleges of
the country have been. the frequent
subjects, of. commendation and ap
proval.

It is therefore, not passing strange
that five of the eight distinguished
medical men who were the guests
of Charlotte yesterday and today
are products of Davidson College.
Their combined periods of study
here cover twenty-one years. There
was! in their records during thote
years the promise of
service to mankind.

Dr. James P.. Matheson, under
whose will the Matheson Lecture
Foundation, created in 1937, has
scheduled the series of lectures
which brings about these eminent
scientists to the’ Carolinas, was
graduaed from Davidson” in the
class of 1899. One of North Caro-
lina’s most widely known and be-
loved physicians, the influence of
his life and character is thus ap-
propriately perpetuated in the Lec-
ture Foundation. 'Atways steadfast
in his devotion to his Alma Mater,
Dr. Matheson generously provided
for the college in his last will and
testament.

Dr. Watson S. Rankin, born in
Mooresville, N. C., was a member
of the Davidson College class of
1901. He is now Trustee and Di-
rector of Hospital and Orphan Sec-
tion, Duke Foundation, Dr. Jno. W.
Moore, born in McConnellsvilte,
S. C., and now Dean and Professor
