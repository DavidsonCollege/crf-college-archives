' Thecollege has had several ‘pipedclipeipen
transfer in; Wood said the college was
hoping to have 50 male freshmen next year
and 10 transfers.

Some female students charge that unfair
advantages are being offered the “Queen-
ers.” The men reside in the only air-condi-
tioned dorm on campus, are said to commit
vandalism with impunity and all but a few
are on full basketball, tennis or academic
scholarships.

Tad Adams, a sophomore transfer from
the Citadel, said of the men, “Basically
everybody is a presidential scholar or has a
basketball or tennis scholarship, with a few
‘independents.’” Adams, an “independ-
ent,” said that despite everything, “the
reception has been really good; everybody
has been really nice.”

Female students wanting air-condition-
ing must buy the unit themselves and then
pay $90 for installation.

“Last year,” said sophomore Missie
Howard, “you wouldn’t walk across cam-
pus and see beer cans strewn all over.”
Also, a large statue of a rhinoceros dis-
played outside a campus building was re-
portedly painted red and yellow and then

, Cation at
Queens Col-
lege is going
“extremely
smoothly”
or not at all
well. The

college, which decided in August 1987 to

admit males to its College of Arts and

Sciences, now has 50 of them out of an

enrollment of 750.

According to Betsey Wood, associate
director of admissions, Queens went co-
educational “because the market for a
women’s college was ridiculously small.
Surveys of high school seniors found that
only two percent would even consider a
women’s college. We wanted to maintain
our standards.”

Current Queens upperclassmen, who
entered the college expecting an all-female
environment for four years, were told of the
decision to integrate barely a month before
returning to school last year.

“They don’t really know how to handle

Many feel they have been “lied to” con-

cal. Both have made acquain-
tances otherwise rarely possible
outside of the classroom.

As Asians make friends and
intermingle with Americans,
they notice culture differences.
They particularly remarked
upon the importance of the indi-
vidual in American culture.

“A lot of emphasis is placed
on the rights of individuals,”
says Nusrat Khan of
Pakistan. “At home
the rights of the indi-
viduals are somewhat
repressed and family
decisions are accu-
mulative decisions.”

“Everyone’s opin-
ion is given so much
importance in class,”
adds Mukherjee.

This individualism is ut al-
ways good when it is promoted
by a desire to succeed based on
materialistic values, says
Sharma.. “Everything is meas-
ured in materialistic values,”
she complains. “Dignity and
self-esteem dre not as important
as having a home and two cars.”

Is there a noticeable differ-
ence between American and
Indian women? Worah thinks
SO. .

“There is a basic difference in
attitudes about what they want
to do after college. In India they
may plan a career but they are
quite conscious that they will
have children and might even
have to put off the career.

good to be independent and self-
confident. Women in India: are
Starting to think like women
here.”

Another positive difference is
the American system of higher
education, primarily because
tests are periodic and students do
not have to. depend upon one
exam at the end of the course to
determine their grade. Instead of
cramming before that exam, as

was the case in their native coun-
try, students find it more benefi-
cial to absorb concepts through-
out the term rather than memorize
facts several days in, advance.
Davidson’s academic rigor has
also made international students

develop time-management skills,

In addition to noticing differ-
ences, Asians are making at-
tempts to share their particular
culture with the college. Efforts to
educate have been made primar-
ily through the annual Interna-
tional Festival. Students in native
dress set up booths displaying
items native to their country and
sell food. The Chatlotte Hindu
Center’s dance troupe has per-
formed Indian traditional
folkdances with the participation

ter Mukherjee is directing an In-
dian play entitled “The Proces-
sion” mostly cast by Indian stu-
dents.

The college itself boasts a
broad curriculum in South Asian
Studies. Begun in 1970, it offers
such courses as Indian art, Bud-
dhist traditions, Sanskrit, self-in-
structional study in Hindi and a
seminar on Gandhi. There is also
the opportunity to spend a term in

India. The Dean Rusk Progtam in

International Studies and the cul-
tural diversity requirement in the

college curriculum are measures
which also seek to increase stu-
dents’ international awareness.
The South Asian Studies pro-
gram has also benefited Indians
raised in the United States. “It has
allowed me to rediscover the
place I’m from,” says Pandya.
The senior has lived in the United
States since the age of two.
According to Pandya, Ameri-
can students are very inquisitive
about Indian culture, an opinion
not shared by all Asians. Pandya
adds that perhaps Americans are
more comfortable speaking with
her since she is more Westernized

than those who have come di-

both Indian and American cul-
tures and says that she is able to
relate to the concerns felt other
South Asians.

It is interesting to remark the
variation in views held by In-
dian students and those Indians
raised in America. Views on
marriage are one example, Pan-
dya’s views on marriage inter-
estingly clash with the opinion

held by Sharma. While the for-

mer disap-
proves of ar-
tanged mar-
riages, Sharma
says they may
sometimes be
preferable. She
advises not
waiting “too
long” for mar-
riage. “Family
is more ¢ important than $20 an
hour,” she believes. She defi-

nitely wants to raise her chil-.

dren in India. :

Jay Chaudhuri, whose father
came to United States from
India, was surprised to find such
a large body of international
students at the college, some of
whom come from his father’s
hometown--Calcutta.

“It gives me the opportunity
to speak Bengali at leisure,” he
says. Since he travels to India
every several years, he com-
ments, “it’s promising to know

The lack of public transporta-
tion in Davidson poses a problem
for those who come from metro-

’ politan cities and are used to buses

and subways. Says Worah, ©

“You’re not able to go out as
much as at home or as much as
other students can.”
