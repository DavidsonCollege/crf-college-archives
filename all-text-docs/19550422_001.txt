Tonight, Davidson’s magnificent
new Belk Dormitory will see serv-
ice for the first time. It is un-
fortunate, Mrs. Little remarked
earlier this week, that the build-
. ing will not be opened by members
of Davidson’s proud male popula-
tion, but by mere women—two
hundred and seventy-one of them,
in fact.

Only the third and fourth floors
of the dorm will be used this
weekend, it was announced, but
these will be filled to capacity;
most of the larger rooms on the
fourth floor will contain three and
four girls per room. Boys wishing
to call for their dates are asked
to use the back entrance of the
building.

the baccalaureate sermon will be
delivered by Rev. Mr. Wilson in the
College Church, From 8 to 11 p.m.
that evening the faculty homes will
be open to seniors, parents, alum-
ni, and friends.

The Academic Procession will
begin at 10:15 a.m., Monday, May
30, and Graduation Exercises will
start at 10:30 a.m. in Chambers.
The address will be given by Dr.
Compton.

Dr. Sanger fo Speak
Ai AED prone

Next week, on April 27, Dr.
Paul W. Sanger from Charlotte
will talk to Alpha Epsilon Delta on
the artificial artery that he and
his associates invented recently.
This will conclude AED's meetings
for the year.

Dr. W. O. Puckett of the David-
son College Science Department
delivered a very interesting lec-
ture, “The Regeneration of Limbs,”
at the regular meeting of Alpha
Epsilon Delta which was held in
the Martin Science Building Wed-
nesday night, April 13.

Using the amphibian salamandar
as an illustration, Dr. Puckett
showed how the cells of the sala-
mander retrogress into'a less ma-
ture state after a limb has been
lost. In the regeneration the cells
go through a process of dedifferen-
(tiation which is closely related to
the process through which cancer
is formed.

New officers for AED were
elected before the lecture for the
1955-56 school year.

Dick Pyle, an outstanding rising
senior from Del Ray Beach, Fla.,
was elected president. Dick is a
member of the Phi Gamma Delta
social fraternity and has been a
member of AED for one year.

Larry Parrott, a Beta from
Charlotte, was elected vice presi-
dent. Linny Baker is the incoming
secretary; Harry Brownlee, the
treasurer; Arthur Martin is the
fraternity historian.

YRC HOLDS MEETING;
ELECTS OFFICERS

The Davidson Young Republi-
cans Club held its annual formal
meeting Wednesday night. Marcus
Hickman, President of the North
Carolina Young Republican Fed-
eration, was guest speaker; of-
ficers for next year were elected.

Outgoing president Mac William-
son is to be succeeded by Tom
Hall; Tom Firor will be vice-
president; Frank Robert, secretary;
John Maultsby, treasurer,

The group plans their next
caucus within two weeks at which
time other Davidson students and
Democrats may join the politicos
in the smoke-filled chamber of the
Green Room.

Panty Raid Scares
Queen's Hierarchy

Last Saturday night at 6:30 p.m.,
Queens College had a called meet-
ing of the student body to discuss
a very serious problem. It seems
that some of the members in high
places had been alerted to expect
a return of the barbaric Davidson
expedition that invaded the girls’
school] a year ago.

Dr. Walker, their illustrious
president, just returned from New
York, called the girls together in
a compulsory meeting to ask their
complete cooperation against the
rioters from the north. (Needless to
say, it being Saturday night, every-
one was present at the meeting.)

The president urged and pleaded
with the girls not to “encourage”
the Davidson gentlemen or arouse
their excitement to a higher pitch
than it already was. Dr. Walker
had received a warning from one
of the Davidson hierarchy after
the somewhat disturbing episode
among the dorms a week ago
Thursday night.

Slightly worried, the young
ladies from our sister school to the
south hastened back to their dorms
to prepare for the ruffians by
gathering their various unmen-
tionables, turning on the lights,
and throwing up the windows.
Much to the ‘relief’ of the girls
and the administration the David-
son hoodiums did not make their
sppearance. (Too bad, fellows, they
were looking for you).

Masquers to Give
‘“Journey’s End’’

By 8. F.

MARTIN

To bring the dramatic season to a close this year the Red

and Black Masquers will present R. C. Sherriff’s

“Journey's

End,” next Friday and Saturday, April 29 and 30. Under the
direction of Professor Raymond W. Tyson, this promises to be
one of the outstanding presentations of recent years.

“Journey’s End,” was first pre-
sented on the London stage where
it ran successfully for several
years before it was brought to the
United States. After its immediate
success on Broadway the road com-
panies of “Journey’s End” toured
through the early thirties result-
ing in an immediate smash hit
throughout the country.

“Journey's End,” has become a
milestone in the progress of con-
temporary drama and its pertinency
lies in the universal presentation
of men at war and the nobility of
human character.

The action for all three acts
takes place in a British Army of-

o

ficer’s dug-out a few yards from
the front line trenches at the St.
Quentin Front, March 1918. In the
first scenes of “Journey’s End,”
the shriek and whine and detona-.
tion of shells puts the setting into
its true perspective as a haven
in a fiendish world of destruction;
and the last scene, during the
beginning of a German drive, punc-
tuates the action with thunder.
The tautest scene in the play
is trench warfare at its most
hazardous. Lieutenant Osborne
(Fred Summers), an elderly, sensi-
tive schoolmaster, and Lieutenant
