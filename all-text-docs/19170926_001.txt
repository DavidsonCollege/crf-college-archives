REPORTERS TO BE CHOSEN |
FOR STATE CLUBS

Plans are being formulated for the
organization of a press club for each
State represented here. Dr. Harding.
chairman of the Press Committee, is
taking the initiative in this regard and is
enthusiastic that a permanent and strong
coterie of clubs he organized. The pur-
pose is to keep the world in touch with
Davidson.

The plan discussed at a meeting in
the Bible room Friday evening is for a
number of students to get in touch with
their weekly county papers and the lead-
ing dailies and report Davidson news to
them. The newspaper correspondents
here are relatively few. This organiza-
tion will push things and the great ac-
complishments and current history of
Davidson will be given considerably
more space in the journals thruout the
South and West. Of course not all the
students will enter into this work. but
it is expected that a good many will do
this patriotic work in the interest of the
college.

Will Soon Be Ready.

With the approach of the opening ot
the class basketball season prospects are
brighter than last year. In addition ta
the old court in the Y. M. C. A. build-
ing, there are two new ones ins the
gymnasium building which is ‘nearing
completion. Goals are soon to be erect
ed in the new courts, which are, with
this exception, now ready for plav.

As far as can be judged from present
indications, the Junior class has — the
strongest representation. Of last year's
team four men have returned... C.
MecAskill, A. S, Potts, R. D. Hall and
T. R. Alexander. The Senior team is
the heaviest looser from failure of men
to return. [. D. Therrell, D. G. Worth,
J. D. Sprunt and C. A. Mountcastle
will be badly missed. However, from
the fifty. men back they may be able to
produce a winner. The Sophomore
team has a good number of its men of
last vear and bids fair to be a strong can-
tender far the cup. The Freshman
class should put out a good aggregation
as they have a large number of men
from which to draw. It it, however, too
early to make any predictions as to their
individual ability.
