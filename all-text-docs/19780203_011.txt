Rock Review

- Sex Pistols revolt”
against status quo

By ROBERT PAYNE

Punk Rock has been the suBject of
more articles than anything in rock
since Newsweek and Time Cover Boy
Bruce Springsteen. And like Bruce
Springsteen, punk is already being
labelled as ‘‘the next big thing.” °

In the seventies rock has become
the establishment it once loathed.

though, the next big thins
Last month the Sex Pistols open
their U.S. tour in Atlanta., All the
media were there. There yropel
contingent of punks—one even had a

safety pin in his cheek —it had all the
makings of an “‘event.”’

The Sex Pistols were good, even
exciting, but the crowd didn't re-
spond in kind. Some of the audience
had come just to gawk, some to
listen, but thé crowd did not get
involved in the music, the audience
was mostly upper middle class (albeit
‘‘Hip’’) and most of them simply
could not relate to Johnny Rotten
leering and snarling: ARRRGH! I am
an anti-christ, I am an anarchist. I
don't know what I want but I know
how to get it. I. want to destroy
passers-by cause I want to be
Anarchy.

I think its sheer inaccesibility will
prevent punk from becoming the

“next big thing” in record sales in the
U.S.. Punk simply doesn't have mass
appeal.

However punk will probably have a
tremendous influence on mainstream
rock. As silly as this sounds, rock’s
history has been as dialectical as
anything Hegel ever thought.

And if punk is the antithesis, what
will be the synthesis? Or whom will
Peter Frampton start spitting on his
audiences?

Who knocks but once

One of the people from my small
high school pulled out a chair beside
me at a library table the other night.
We do not see each other nearly as
much as I had thought we would
before school started this year, so
these library encounters af® usually a
welcome opportunity to discuss the
old names and the old places.

But not that night.

I had a major test early the next
morning which I had only begun to
study for fifteen minutes earlier. No,
study is the wrong word. I had little
to study from. I had done my
homework on a pay-as-you-go plan
and was in the act of realizing that |
would indeed pay.

“What’cha studying,” he said.

‘“Spanish,”’ I said. :

There was a pause.

“You know, some people say that
Rogerson is harder than Hlibtschuk,”’
he said, trying to be sympathetic. He
takes Hlibtschuk. I take Rogerson.

‘I know, some people will say
anything,’’ I said, impaled
momentarily on a vocabulary word 1
didn’t know which seemed to be
cropping up in every third sentence.

There was another pause.

‘Ken Rogers died yesterday,” he
said with a change of expression, a
deepening of the eyes. “Of a heart
attack.”’

At first I did not realize what he
had said and then I did and there was
a tightening in the chest and I did not
know what to say.

DAVIDSON

“He was in your class, wasn’t he?”’
he said,

“‘Umm...yes,”’ I said quietly.

There was a long pause, a hesitant
pause.

The Spanish book dropped.

I remembered things. Ken in a
letter jacket, erect and eyes flashing,
talking about pride in a football pep
rally. Ken the campaign manager for
the losing candidate, himself all too
pleasantly persuasive to be belived.

‘Another
Window

By CHARLES ERWIN

Features Editor ;

I wanted to feel outrage. People my
age should not die. Let death be for
the good old people, for the Mister
Goudys who have lived long and
fulfilling lives.

The romantic ideal of dying young
before the body weakens and the mind
becomes frail is all'wrong. Dying
young does not leave someone a hero,
it only leaves them dead. Cut off from
the sorrows and the pleasures and the
growth of life.

It is sad
