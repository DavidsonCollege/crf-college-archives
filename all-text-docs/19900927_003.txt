Davidson Fraternity Members
Will Go to Bat for Habitat

By TINA SMITH

Members of the Davidson
College chapter of Kappa Sigma
fraternity will literally go to bat for

the Davidson Habitat for Human-

ity on Saturday, September 29. The
fraternity members will play their
second annual 100-inning softball
game to raise awareness and funds
for Habitat. The game, which is
expected to last 15 hours, begins at
7a.m.at MoorParkin Mooresville.

Habitat is a non-profit organi-
zation that provides affordable
housing to: worthy, low income
families. Qualified families physi-

cally aid in the building of their
home with the help of local volun-
teers. Sophomore John Rowe,
assistant service coordinator for
Kappa Sigma, said that “Davidson

has many needy residents who can

benefit from the work of Habitat

for Humanity. Profits from the |

game will help buy land, supplies
and tools for the local chapter.”
The game is part of Kappa
Sigma’s support of community
activities. The fraternity concen-
trates on local projects to help its
members understand the impact of
giving in a particular community.
Kappa Sigma also coordinates the

Mothers Against Drunk Driving
(MADD) Run and helps to bring
donations to Jubilee House, a resi-
dential Christian organization in
Charlotte.

“We emphasize service as a
building tool for brotherhood,” said
Kappa Sigma service coordinator
Doug Long.

“Tt’sa good way for us to get to
know the freshmen and do some-
thing fun which requires almost
total house involvement,” related
Rowe. “The softball game itself is
a lot of laughs. It’s not serious
competition and both spectators

and players have a great time.”

Professor Looks At Narcoterrorism

believes the money is misdirected.
“Everything goes to the military,”
she said. “But that won’t eliminate
the problem at the source. No one
addresses the socioeconomic con-
dition of the farmers. To be effec-
tive, aid must be aimed at a combi-
nation of lawenforcementand crop
replacement.”

Sendero Luminoso is unique
among world terrorist organiza-
tions. Founded in 1970 by a Peru-
vian university philosophy profes-
sor, Abimacl Guzman, the move-
ment has never been linked to
outside governments or organiza-
tions. For more than a decade it has
carried out a vidlent, clandestine

‘rebellion in Peru unlike any seen
thus far in the western hemisphere.
Guzman still leads the group in its
drive to overthrow the existing
order, purge South America of its

Western influences and restore the
land to some sort of Communist
rule by its native inhabitants.
Guzman’s followers include a large
number of intellectuals, as well as
Peru’s long-neglected Indian and
mestizo population.

Tarazona-Sevillano explained,
“Their movement is a fusion of
modern communism with Peru-
vian heritage. They use terrorism
and sabotage to avenge the wrongs
visited upon their ancestors, and
view their movement as a cell that
will spread to bring true justice to
the world.”

In the middle 1980s, Sendcro
Luminoso, which is totally self-
supporting, made alliance with the
cocaine syndicate to increase their
income for expanding their move-
ment. Though these two groups
have different objectives and idc-

-Ologies, they share a mutual en-
emy--the Peruvian goverment

Their impact is an expensive bur-
den for anew democratic govern-
mentalready besieged by complex
problems.

More than 16,000 Peruvians
have dicd in the 10-year struggle
between the government and Sen-
dero Luminoso. And the infusion
of cocaine money is making it an
even more deadly war. Tarazona-
Sevillano estimates that the organi-
zation now comprises about 20,000
armed fighters and hundreds of
thousands of sympathizers.

In addition to her new book,
Tarazona-Sevillano has written
articles for publications such as
The Christian Science Monitor and
the Ailanta Constitution . In the
‘summer of 1989 she wasa visiting
scholar at the Hoover Institution at
Stanford University. At Davidson,
she teaches seminars on the drug
wars, international eco-politics and
law and terrorism.

Davidson Combines
Athletics and Academics

bly, the grants will come to men’s
sports (besides basketball) when
the moncy is available. Now that
those grants belong to Davidson’s
women’s sports, the impact has
been immediate.

It has been a difficult road
recently for Davidsonathictics, one
filled with the obstacles of our

small sizcand lack of scholarships.
Buta few well-placed scholarships
(to draw quality student-athletes to
Davidson) have combined with
Davidson’s ever-prescnt work
ethic to produce an inordinate
amountof success. And if we only
continuc on that road, it scems
likely that even greater success
lics ahead.

Literary Magazine to
Change Approach

at Davidson. “We're looking for
anything that might be reproduced
in a magazine, whether it be
photo’s, paintings, drawings or
sculptures which could be photo-
graphed. I want to use Hobart
Park to recognize all good work
Davidson produces, whether we
can publish it or not--we will defi-
nitely sponsor an exhibition of the
entries we receive.”

All three editors have idcas to
improve the quality of Davidson’s

literary magazine and broaden its

scope to include more of the-col-
legecommunity. Willthcy beable
to realize them? Perhaps.

However, they realize they will
have some difficultics. Says Clay,
“T know we have a lot of work to
do. But I think it will be worth it.
After all, at a liberal arts college,
the quality of the student magazine
should be a reflection of the qual-
ity of the students.”
