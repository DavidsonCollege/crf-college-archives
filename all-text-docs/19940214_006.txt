cleared away.

A number of Davidson writ-
ers have tried to bring problems,
like the one of racism, to light. But
more and more, I am beginning to
think that this is an exercise in
futility. Along with such articles
seem to be all of the committees on
this campus which endorse aware-
ness of this or that social ill.

What is the good in all of this
probing? What does it come to? It
comes to this: a sickening revela-
tion that we like things the way
they are. The last thing the house-
wife has in mind when she turns on
trash television is changing her
life. But now, the greatest horrors
have become vaudeville in the
Great American Relish of talk show
smut. How badly were they
burned? How many crimes were
committed? Ooh, delicious.

It seems that this was not al-
ways so. Communication began
because of a need to inform. The
need to inform is grounded in our
Constitution. It was decided that

Reverend.

Wiaite at home over Christmas
break, I hung out with some of my

younger brothers’ friends. I’m not
going to start complaining about
how boring my break was because
of the screwed up schedule
Davidson had planned. I think that
the subject has already been given
enough attention. I don’t need to
write further about it. (Unless, of
course, I can’t think of anything to
write about some other week.)

Anyway, one of my brothers’
friends (we’ll call him Josh be-
cause that’s his name) informed
me that he was an honest-to-gosh
reverend. I became immediately
intrigued. How could this man
who resembles Charles Manson
and drives his very own personal
school bus have become a rever-
end so fast? Just when I was start-
ing to feel really old, he told me I
could become a reverend, too. I
lost interest. After all, I could
become a bartender, but you have
to pay for some guy you made fun
of in high school to teach you how
to make all those fancy-wancy
drinks with umbrellas in them and
stuff. I was sure that there had to be
some kind of catch (i.e., it wasn’t
free).

On the contrary, as my new-
found friend informed me, dona-
tions were optional (i.e. it was free).
My heart leapt in my chest. Could
I become a minister for no cost or
other obligation? He gave me a
post card to fill out. That’s all there
was to it. (I had to pay for a stamp.
I knew there was a catch.)

So, to make a long story not as
long as I could have, I am a minis-

‘ter in the Universal Life Church

right to know these things. The
underlying idea is that knowledge
of the truth would call people to act
in certain ways. Thank goodness
for Paine’s Common Sense. Truth
was the foundation for hope. But
these days, hope isn’t doing so
well.

Hope has never been so dis-
couraging. It might even be less
unsettling if there were no hope.
Then it would make sense why our
culture is aroused by the perverse,

such a bad state. In that case, hope
would be a good thing. It would
inspire, and give cause to try. But
things are not so good.

We have hope. And it’s ter-
rible.

We can change things. For

example, we can turn off the tele-

vision. But we don’t want to. We
now have to reconcile ourselves to
the fact that we really don’t want to
change things. It seems to me that
the teenager stuck on the couch all

ing soap operas and talk shows is
emblematic of the American con-
dition. For example, how many
times have you made suggestions
to a friend who has asked for ad-
vice only to have them gleefully
reject each suggestion? When did
it become so good to have no way
out?

It became good to be hopeless
when the meaning ofhope changed.
Where hope once signified possi-
bility, it now uncovers our worst

Ihave such a purpose. Itis not
my point to say that no one cares,
and boy, now we’re really in a fix
and really hopeless. No, hope is
still there; it’s not as fickle as that.
Nor do I think we need yet another
committee, like maybe a Lack of
Concern Awareness. Committee.
That would be another silly goose
step at pretending the real problem
isn’t there.

Caring isnot awareness.
Awareness is watching the news
(who is anything but indifferent to
the news?). Caring is letting some-
thing change your life forever. The
real problem, it seems, isthat people
either feel they cannot change or
they do not want to. I think both of
these are negative.

It is my purpose to say that
people largely have stopped car-
ing. This is not something to be
ignored and shrugged off as just
the way itis, and until people actu-
ally start caring again, they are not
going to do anything to change the
world, much less themselves.

based in Modesto, California. (In-
sert California joke here. If you
can’t come up with one, I’m sure
that Whistlin’ Dixie guy can help
you out.)

Now, this is a special church.
Even asa reverend of ULC, I don’t
have to give up my Catholic affili-
ations (much to my mother’s un-
bridled relief). My understanding
is that this is pretty much an “any-
thing goes” church, (much like
some people believe schools such
as Williams and Amherst to be).
Let me quote from the dogma:
“We believe only in that which is
right and everyone has the right to
determine what is right for them-
selves.” That sounds simple
enough, right?

Now I have the actual legal
right to put the title "Reverend" in
front of my name. I’mnotkidding.
At least I can fall back on some-
thing if I never get around to mak-
ing my resume. The world always
needs ministers. And Davidson,
you lucky school you, there is a
real live reverend in attendance at
this school right now. If I ever get
a chance to be on the Inspirational
Channel, I’1l make the school proud
and mention my alma mater on the
air.

I don’t want to enter into any
kind of competition with the school
chaplain or anything like that. It’s
just that sometimes you need to
take your spiritual crises to a fel-
low student. And boy, doI know a
lot about spiritual crises, I’ve had
more of them than Rosanne Arnold

We should wear wings.

I wrote last about using your
education while at home. This
week’s topic will be how to use
your education while here. I think
I’ll narrow the topic to being in a
basketball crowd, though, because
our team is giving their all and
coming up big, and we must step it
up a notch in terms of support to
make this thing work.

Descartes really doesn’t come
into play at a basketball game, be-
cause you would cheerat the wrong
things. You would get all excited
about the fact that our team exists
in the physical world and lose sight
of the fact that Mark McGuire just
missed a ten-footer. We’re gonna
call this “tough love,” because
Philadelphia boobirds have taught
me that negativity motivates; so,
‘we must command excellence from
our team and not be satisfied with
just the fact that they exist.

Actually, our classes do not
teach us much about how to act at
Baker. Perhaps Speech 101 teaches
us how to be heard and how to
gesticulate; and Bio teaches us why
the guy next to me smells; but the
non-academic knowledge is what
we will have to rely on when it
comes to being clever.

Back in the day, Princeton stu-
dents, accustomed to being behind
by 20, would chant, “That’s alright,
that’s OK, you’ll be working for us
someday.” Snobbiness aside, we
need cute chants and general

rowdiness. When I watch Duke
play on ESPN, aside from the per-
functory scorn with which Duke
should always be viewed, one has
to respect the “Cameron Crazies,”
who jump up and down the whole
game and heckle the other team
into oblivion.

Just last night, I saw some
fans at Missouri wearing antlers.
Thinking that was cute, I remem-
bered that their nickname is the
Tigers. So much for the antler
thing. We’re the Wildcats...we
could wear wings!

Actually, let us not take a
page from the book of an over-
enrolled state school. What we
need is a clever, personal, insult-
ing chant for every school in our
league. We could start by saying
something about the fact that VMI
has somehow avoided the whole
gender controversy. We could at-
tribute that to the fact that their
alumni, watching the games, have
been trickedinto thinking they have
women enrolled already (and
they’re on the floor, suited up). I
think you get the picture.

What we need is creativity,

enthusiasm, and originality. In all:

seriousness, our team is giving a
great effort and we should go out
and support them as much as pos-
sible. Who knows? Maybe we’ll
play Princeton in the tournament
and we can tell them who they’ Il be
working for in four years.

How can you tell in a brief en-
counter if someone is racist? In
most cases it is not a clear-cut
issue. After reading Joan Miller’s
letter to the editors about an exas-
perating experience at Dover’s Su-
permarket, I have decided to re-
spond.

Just in case you did not read
her letter, I will briefly explain:
Ms. Miller, an African-American
woman, attempted to be waited on
at Dover’s, but after standing at the
counter for five minutes, she real-
ized she was being ignored. For
the simple reason that these two
employees were white, she imme-
diately assumed that the problem
was racially motivated.

I agree that one could inter-
pret that they were ignoring her
because she was African-Ameri-
can, but couldn’ tit also be possible
that they were having a bad day or
just plain busy? Ms. Miller did not
indicate that they ever made one
remark oreven opened their mouths
to indicate they did not like Afri-
can Americans.

I debated about writing this
article because I did not want to
alienate the Davidson African-
American. population, but I feel
that Ms. Miller may have been
hypersensitive to the issue. I agree
that there are many racist people in
this world, but why does she auto-
matically have to assume that these
employees hold something against
her race? Maybe this is the way
that these incompetent workers
treat all their customers. (When
someone is not working on a com-
