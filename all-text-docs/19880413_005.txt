Seven Samurai teach villagers the value of self-reliance

By FRANK LORD
The Seven Samurai. Directed by Akira
Kurosawa. Starring Toshiro .Mifune and
Takashi Shimura. 1954. Shows in Love
Auditorium at 8PM on Saturday 4/9 and
Tuesday 4/12. Admission is $1.50

Eastern films in general and Japanese
films in specific do got get much exposure
in this area which is sad because there are
many great pieces of cinematic art that have
come out of Japan. Of the great Japanese
directors, Akira Kurosawa is perhaps the
most universally admired. His career has
spanned many years and had included such
masterpieces as Ran - his most recent film
- and this weeks Cinema Classics offering:
The Seven Samurai.

Set in Medieval Japan, The Seven
Samurai is the story of a small village of
farmers who discover that a group of brig-
ands have decided to come and steal all
their food as soon as their crops are har-
vested. Convinced that they are unable to
defend themselves, the townspeople set out
to find a group of Samurai to defend their

‘town from the attackers.

The first part of the film is the story of
their attempts to find Samurai who will be
willing to risk their lives for the town’s de-
fense without the benfit of any kind of
reward. Because the town is a small farm-
ing community, the have great difficulty in
finding the necessary men. However, after
mnay attempts, they do finally succeed.

The second part of the film takes place
in the village as the crops are harvested and
the Samurai prepare for the defense of the
town against the brigands. The final, most

"as the rythym of the cuts

spectacular, part of the film is the battle the
pits the townspeople and the Seven Samu-
rai against the invading brigands.

The basic theme of the film is one of
self-reliance. In the beginnig of the film,
the townspeople see the brigands and
Samurai in general in the same category as
catastrophes of weather and disease. That |
is to say that they feel helpless in the face of
events and forces that seem to be beyaond
their control.

They, therfore, seek aid in the form of an
equally powerful force - the seven samurai.
Gradually, over the course of the film, they
find that they are not so helpless as they
once thought and slowly learn to fend for
themselves. '

Like many great films, the basic narra-
tive of the Seven Samurai is only half of
what makes it a great film. The technical
structure of the film is a least as interesting
as sits plot. Though, by the time the Seven
Samurai was made, the revolution in theuse
of montage - best exemplified in Sergei
Eisentein’s film The Battleship Potempkin

‘of 1925 - and in the use of deep focus cine-
matography - accomplished by Orson
Welles in his landmark film Citizen Kane of
1941 - had already passed. Kurosawa uses
these developments. to make a visually
stunning epic. The mon-
tage of the final battle
scene - which encom-
passes almost a third of
the entire film - leaves

Kurosawa makes eloquent comparisons be-
