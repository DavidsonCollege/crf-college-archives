able to sing. As good as her word,
Susan's fairy godmother waved the
shimmering wand three tinies, and
the cold gray room on top of the
castle was transformed into a soft
blue and crimson ballroom, with
murals on the walls, and a stringed
instrument in front of each picture.

Susan blinked her cyes and re-|
gained her breath, but then remem-
bered that she was dressed in rags,
and was ashamed to be in such a
beautiful room looking like Cald-
well’s hero with nothing but a torn,
dirty dress to wear, So she asked
her fairy godmother for some pretty
clothes, like Zola’s heroine wore.
when she wore any clothes at ail.
At once, she found herself in a
long blue satin dress, and gold
slippers that shone almost as
brightly as her fairy godmother’s
magic wand.

Susan was overcome with de-
light, but being no mean dilettante,
she knew that she had two more
obligations to Fill. and knew as well
that one wish would satisfy them
both. For Shaw's sake, she used
her final wish. “Please, Fairy
Godmother, may [ have. three real
peopte to help me enjoy this happi-
ness” Without a further word, the
starry wand encircled the room
three times. and when it had come
to rest, there, by the murals, sat
three real people, one with a vio-
lin, the second with a clarinet, and
the third with a ‘cello. Susan now
possessed everything that she
could ever have wanted; she started
to thank her fairy godmother, but
in a blinding flash of light, her
godmother disappeared as quickly
as she had come.

The little girl did not know just
what to make of all this, but since
she had read all of Lewis's fairy
tales, she knew that Sooner or later

kept in a more or less proper per-
spective. Our athletic program has
been quite properly relegated to
a relatively secondary role in the
total life of the college. As a result
of this fact our athletic teams over
the past several years have been
consistent losers. Because of our
unwillingness or inability to com-
pete with other. schools on an equal
footing. we have managed to come
off only second best in major inter-
mural competition. But Davidson
students and alumni ave just as de-
sirous to win as any other com-
parable group of Americans and
herein lies our’ danger. If this de-
sire should- become dominant at any
foreseeable tithe in the future, then
we can look for a corresponding
campromising of our general acad-
emié excellence, with a resulting
increased emphasis upon a program
of activity which bears a_ lesser
relation to the ideals and aspira-
tions which Davidson stands for.
To this possibility two solutions
immediately present themselves:
cither Davidson can give up a sport
such as collere football entirely,
or, as’ am alternative and perhaps
more satisfying course of action;
our sports schedule can be so ar-
ranged that we play teams which
are generally our equal in caliber
of ability. To implement this second
possibility Davidson could with-
draw from the Southern Con-
ference and enter a league such
as the North State Conference,
which contains teams with which
we could compete on a more fa-
vorable basis.

This then is the situation, as t
ce it. Either Davidson ean retain
its. high standards of academic at-
tainment and maintain its athletic
program in its proper. place, or else
the school can fall prey to the
same ifls which have overtaken

THE

Time Queries: Is Youth Silent
Or Does World Fail To Hear Cry

‘(Ed. Note—After Time maga-
zine published a survey of the
attitudes and condition of
American youth today, the Da-
vidsonian considered it of such
importance to merit the sum-
mary below.)

Youth today is waiting for fate
to show its hand. It waits quietly
without the manifestoes and posters
of the Vlaming Youth of the 20's.
Its chief concern is the “Korean
business” and a lot of other busi-
ness that may follow,

Ik believes war with Russia is
unavoidable, but is taking that fact
with a great deal more calm than
it did earlier in the Korean war.
Its members admit freely they will
avoid the draft as long a» possible,
yet active pacifism is not a dom-
inant part of. its thinking.

A good secure job ix avout all it
really wants, It plans no world-
shaking ventures, but just wants a
good job with a big firm and a
comfortable sarburban home. “Lt’s
fathers did ‘too well. Any moment-
ous tasks it shoves off on the gov-
erment””

Youth has accepted life with-
in the well-padded structure of
organized society, but lacks a
desire to do any of society's
organizing.

Modern youth are no longer in-
dividuals nor -have. individual ideas.
They are parts of small groups.
Alone they become’ bored and un-
happy.

DAVIDSONIAN

Almost of itself it has picked
up the right ideals from an
American tradition older than
its parents.

Its novelists with characteristic-
ly orthodox liberalism evince the
feeling that life is short on reward
and long on treachery,

Educators complain that their do-
cile note-taking students have no
militant beliefs, They can only be
stirced to comment on race rela-
tions and world government, but
then with no absorbnig concepts.
It -believes in democracy, but not
aloud.

It feels the need. for a faith,
but isn’t sure where to look for
one, God is still a vaguely comfort-
ing thought, but has become more
of a factor in their: thinking. More
go to church, though partly be-
cause Of increased youth enter-
tainment programs there.

Believing he is serving because
of a government miscue, the young
soldier wants most of all t@ come
home. He does not go in for heroics,
is short on ideals and self-reliance
and is in for personal security’ at
any price. He lacks flame, but su-
perior fire-power helps him do a
creditable job.

The best thing to be said is that
American youth has learned it
must try to make the best of a
hard and difficult situation, It does
not feel cheated or biame anyone
as it was blamed for “failure”
World War IT. It blames life, but
isn't cynical because it never hoped
for much.
