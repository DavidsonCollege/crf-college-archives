SGA issues

a minors
resolution

Proposal prepares to go
before faculty for vote

NARESH NAGELLA

The quest for minors has en-
tered Round Two of its struggle to
gain faculty approval.

Tuesday, the SGA unani-
mously approved the Council on
Academic Affairs’ revised pro-
posal for the institution of minors
into the official curriculum.

The new proposal would make
minors optional for departments to
offer, constitute 5 to 7 courses in
the desired subject and require a
2.0.GPA forall students wishing:to
minor. It would also not ‘allow
students to pursue two minors or
minor with a double major.

The-changes allow for depart-
mental flexibility in creating a mi-
nor and would not require depart-
ments to offer a minor.

The proposal is now before
the Educational Policy Commit-
tee, where it will undergo a one
month review.

The EPC wants to make sure
the new proposal is significantly
changed and will check with peer
institutions that have minors about
the administrative costs and suc-
cess of such a program.

According to Senior Rick
Onkey, who attended the EPC
meeting, the EPC “sensed a lack of
student support for minors. De-
spite the SGA vote, many teachers

had not heard personally from stu- .

dents on the issue.”

Director of Career Services
Carol Jordan states minors would
let “the student make himself or
herself more unique and competi-
tive (in trying for jobs) and will be
to that student’s advantage.”

-The CAA proposal responds
to those worried that minors will
dilute the liberal arts experience
by saying, “‘The core requirements
for graduation already encourage
students to explore a variety of
courses in different disciplines.”

Sophomore Psychology: ma-.:
jor Brian’ Weddell favors minors’:

saying, “I already will enough
courses in Spanish and French to
get minors in those areas, but in-
stead I can only list them as unof-
ficial ‘concentrations’ on my re-
sume.”

The EPC should vote on the
proposal sometime in the middle

‘of March.

If it passes there, it will be up
for formal and final approval dur-
ing the April faculty meeting. If it
survives that vote, minors would
be available for students to pursue
beginning next semester.

SGA President Warren Buford
states, “If students want to have
minors, they better become vocal
about it to faculty members. With
student wide support, the measure
can get passed.”

CANNING THE KEG

The days of kegs will soon be over — the Self Study Sub-committee on Student Life found
that they are too risky. See more self study results on page 2.

Some call it the “end of era.”
Others are calling it “safety pre-
cautions.” Everyone agrees it will
be a major change in the way
Davidson parties on Patterson
Court. :

As a priority recommenda-
tion from the recently released
self study states, “The college
‘should ban the use of common
containers, including kegs, for any
student social function on cam-
pus.”

The self study says a “double
standard” is being set by allowing
kegs on Patterson Court but ban-
ning them from all other areas on
the campis.

In addition, all seven national
fraternities ban the use of kegs
and spending of chapter funds on

Dean Shandley states the change
as one “about safety and health,
not about abolition or abstinence,”

At the forum, a North Caro-
lina Governor’s Council report was
cited. This reported that it found
Davidson to be the only college in
the state to allow kegs at parties.

John Cowan, PCC president,
indicates his concern for the cur-
rent policy and assured the change
was not totally an alcohol control
tactic by the administration, but an
issue of insurance.

He says, “The insurance prob-
lems began to worry almost every-
one on the council. Even if we all
say that we would not sue (in the
event of an accident) it is no guar-

Stating, “Considering that most
of the college’s policies relating
to the court aren’t enforced any-
way, I don’t think it this will make
that big of a difference.”

Junior Suzy Spressert, Rusk
President, says, “I think thateven-
tually the school is going to have
to make some major changes. I
understand that we’re going to
have to move to BYOB in the
future ... but I don’t think we’re
ready for that until we do (further)
research,”

Despite the mixed student re-
action, it seems most will simply
have to prepare for the change.

Georgia Southern won both

Davidson’s swimmers recorded
many personal bests.

Senior Katharine Welling ech-

“The meet went really well,”
