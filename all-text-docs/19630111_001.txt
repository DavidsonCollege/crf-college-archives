Award For Composition

Ending three months of anticipation, notice reached Davidson’s Professor David |
F. Richey recently that he was the recipient of this year’s Rheta Sosland Award.

The competition, now in its
third year, seeks to encourage
the composition of chamber
music for the string quartet.
Under the auspices of the Uni-
versity of Kansas City, the win-

Good Nus: They |

Give Most Blood

Sigma Nu Fraternity won its
eighth “bleeding contest” Dec.
10-11 in the Red Cross biannual
blood drive.

The fraternity had 88 per cent
of its members contributing in
the drive. ATO and Beta Theta
Pi..were runners. up. One of
these three fraternities has won
every time the contest has been
held.

A plaque is given to the fra-
ternity with the highest per cent
of its members contributing, and
that fraternity is allowed to
keep the plaque until the next
drive. With its seventh win last
spring, Sigma Nu was given
permanent possession of the old
plaque for having won it more
times than any other fraternity.

When asked how his fraterni-
ty won the plaque, Sigma Nu
President John Oehler replied
that it has “sort of become tra-
dition” for his fraternity to con-
tribute blood and that the fra-
ternity considered the drive “a
very worthwhile project..”
Oehler also noted that Blood
Chairman Bill Davis rounded up
the members for the drive.

The spring blood drive will
probably be held in April. How-
ever, no definite date has yet

been set.

and is honored at a performance
of his composition by the Mid-
America String Quartet.

The quartet is in its tenth
year as a professional organiza-
tion, and is composed of the
top musicians of the Kansas
City Symphony. Thursday eve-
ning they will perform his win-
ning entry, String Quartet No. I.

Born in Abilene, Texas,
Richey studied piano under Miss
Craig Lasley. From Abilene he
went to Oberlin where he re-
ceived his Master of Piano de-
gree. Following two years in the
service, he returned to Oberlin
for one year.

Plans Internship

The State of North Carolina
will conduct a Summer Intern-
ship Program in State Govern-
ment from June 17 to August 23.

The program will provide an
opportunity for twenty  out-
standing college students to
work in fifteen agencies of the
state government. The student
interns will discuss the political,
social and economic problems
of North Carolina in evening
seminars to be held twice a
week and in weekly luncheons.
State officials and _ political
scientists will speak at these
seminars and luncheons.

Besides providing college
students with a chance to learn
something about the state, this
program is intended to help at-
tract superior students to ca-
reers in state government.

He told the Council that more
definite developments would
probably come out of the meet-

on Fraternities and Social Life
next week.

After finally meeting with the
committee for the first time in
December, Carrell was very
pleased with the outcome. “They
were very cooperative in the
meeting with us,”’ he exclaimed.

Although he refused to com-
ment on any specific details
concerning the meeting last
month, Carrell seemed very
optimistic over the prospects
for the upcoming meeting.
“We'll get down to brass tacks
this time,” he stated.

President D. Grier Martin
commented, “I was delighted to

sidering the competition he

Scholar are these: that the can-
didate exhibit both quality of

emphasis is accorded to physical
prowess “as shown by fondness
for and success in sports.”

Carrell announced the Stud-
ent-Faculty Conference Commit-
tee meeting on Thursday of this
week, but received no sugges-
tions for topics to be discussed.

Carrell also appointed a com-
mittee to revise the statement
that is signed by all incoming
freshmen. It is a student's state-
ment of intent to abide by the
regulations of the college and
is kept on file by the Dean of
Students.

Five members were absent
from the meeting—the Coun-
cil’s last in this semester.

Dr. Guy R. Vowles,
Former Prof, Dies

Funeral services for Dr. Guy
Richard Vowles, 79, former Dav-
idson professor, were conducted
yesterday afternoon at the Col-
lege Church.

Vowles, who died Tuesday in
a Charlotte hospital, was a pro-
fessor of German at Davidson
from 1925 until his retirement
in 1953. At the time of his death,
he was living at 504 Lorrimer
Road in Davidson.

A native of North Dakota,
Vowles took his AB at Yankton
College. Selected for a Rhodes
Scholarship, he studied at Ox-
ford from which he received the
BA and MA degrees. He taught
at Fargo College until 1922.

One professor expressing

exams. “It’s too early to really

One problem the new cut sys-
tem leaves unsolved was under-
lined by English instructor J.
G. Gross. “Only four out of 20
students showed up for my 2:30
class the last day before the
Thanksgiving holidays. This sort
of problem creates an awkward
situation sinee discussions in
following classes depend on ma-
terial presented in those pre-
ceding. This problem is not re-
lated to this new cut system,”
he hastily added. “I'm pleased
with the cut system's operation
so far.”

Monday,

President Martin, who served
as 1961 chairman of the Rhodes
Scholarship Committee meeting
in Atlanta, held the position
again this year. Invited to serve
by Dr. Courtney Smith, Ameri-
can Secretary of the Rhodes
Scholarships, Martin was leader
of a seven-member committee.

This committee selected final
winners from District II, com-
posed of Tennessee, Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, and Florida.

When President Martin was
asked in THE DAVIDSONIAN
interview about his part in help-
ing select Danny Carrell, he
answered, “I couldn't push for
Danny too hard because of pos-
sible adverse effects .. . he won
on his own ability.”

Six of the committee mem-
bers are Rhodes winners
themséives; it is customary
that the chairman is not. Two
candidates come to the final
elimination from each state,
and the district selects not
more than four winners. Mar-
tin’s committee selected four
this year.

The interviews were held in
Atlanta on Dec. 15, but the com-
mittee and candidates met on
the evening of Dec. 14 for din-
ner. This meeting was President
Martin's first contact with the
other candidates.

At 9 a.m. Dec. 15, the final
competition began. The per-
sonal interview plays the most
important part in determin-
ing the selections since all
candidates reaching the finals
have nearly equal qualifica-
tions in leadership, scholastic,
and athletic ability.

Each boy was given a twenty-
minute interview although this
was not a strictly enforcetl
limit. Some candidates took
