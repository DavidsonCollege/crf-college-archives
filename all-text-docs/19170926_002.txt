“There is no place, however remote,
where one does not find the enterprising
German.” —Bryce.

We take this privilege of welcoming
the editor of Quips and Cranks. Lilly
is going to give us a good annual.

The sympathy of the student body
zoes out to N. S. Richards, '20, in his
accident. We hope to soon have him
‘out again.

Whether you do or do not like the
present tendency of the college curricula
universally, read in the September Scrib-
ner's “College Studies and College
Tests.” by President Hadley, of Yale.

“The great heart of mankind ever
heats in sense and sympathy with the
weaker.” Isn't this a fine saying of
John Galsworthy'’s—the man whom the
critics are having little mercy on now?
Strengthen your ideal of the man or na-
tion who is true to his ideal by reading
his play—Mob. You will appreciate
his dramas if you have not been intro-
duced to them already. They are in
the library—Get the habit.

A few nights ago a friend called
around and we had a heart to heart con-
fab about affairs of college life. This
fellew, who is a close observer of col-
lege and dormitory spirit, draws the con-
clusion that the Rumpleites are one set
and that the student body lives in the
other dormitories. He seemed to think
that the students in Rumple were segre-
ating themselves and that their habitat
was restricted to their dormitory only.

lf this is right, we hope that those
fellows will become a part of the stu-
dent body. This can be done in the
estimation of the accuser by a more gen-
eral mingling with the residents of the
other domiciles. You can do this and

is hoped that a sufficient number of in-
stitutions will make a sacrifice in some
way so that this fund may be initiated.
This Fund will go to Army Secretarial

ork.

This plan is being considered, and
after a consultation with Dr. Martin,
Mr. Thomas will probably bring it be-

fore the student body.

The magazine was, when the class of
1918 entered, a seven-issue publication.

Then its subscription was practically re-

stricted to the members of the Literary
Societies—hbeing edited and financed by

them. Later it was made a student body
publication and only four issues in a
collegiate year.

Think about this before you vote
either way (should it be brought up) in
a student body mecting. It will mean
probably no magazine at all if it is not
gotten oul as usual. Let us not have a
compromise even of two issues. Why?
Because the career of the magazine has
been a checquered one—having had
numbers of ups and downs in its his-
tory. Now it is on a solid basis and it
should continue. Because the college
world is in an unnatural, unnormal state
already. Because there are those of lit-
erary talent and aspiration who would
not get the training that is due him. A
man will often write for publication
when he will not write for the waste
basket or the letter file. Because you
will not get to know the men in college
as you would—by this, you would not
appreciate their work—for you would
not know that they did any. Because
the magazine staff will become unorgan-
ized. The men composing the present
staff are men of experience and can give
us a top-notch magazine. Probably they
have gotten ideas and experience from
the preceding staff. These plans, to-
gether with their own, they would be-
queath to the succeeding staff—thus, as
it were, the genius remaining in the
family. Tf a magazine is not gotten out
this year there are all odds against
there not being one next year and on
and on. When you do want to get out
a magazine you will have a green, raw,
staff who probably would issue some-
thing of which you would be ashamed.

President Wilson has said for school,
college and university athletics to be
continued. Isn't the inference that he
desires that all aspects of college activi-
ties should run in their normal channels ?
Men get training in literary pursuits as
well as they do in athletics—and_ train-
ing is the function of athletics. Let us
contend for our magazine.

STOP! THINK! then SPEAK!
METHODIST MEETING

CLOSED THURSDAY NIGHT

The meeting which has being con-
ducted in the local Methodist church
last week was unexpectedly brought to
a close on Thursday night. It became
necessary for Rev. W. L. Hutchins, of
Newton, N. C., who was assisting Rev.
Mr. Jenkins, of the local church, in this
meeting, to return to his parish.

Rev. Mr. Jenkins, the pastor, expects
toa recommence the meeting again some
time during October.

HISTORICAL COMMISSION
PRESERVING RECORDS

The North Carolina Historical Com-

yet keep up the reputation that Rumple/ mission has asked for a copy of the photo-

is still the place where “ye studious

boys” live.

It has been suggested by the Y. M.
C. A. to L. M. Thomas, editor-in-chief
of The Davidson College Magazine,
that a part or the entire amount of the
funds for the publication of the maga-
zine be donated to a Y. M. C. A. War
Fund. The idea in this embraces other
college and universities in its scope. It

graph of the Davidson men at the first
Officers’ Training Camp, at Fort Ogle-
thorpe. This picture will be preserved
and put on display in the Hall of His-
tory as a part of the war record.

Tt seems that this board is at work
getting what details and data and rec-
ords of our part in the World War.
Nothing will be of so much value to
historians and future generations as this
conserving of history as it is made.

Mean more than money to you. If
you’re a Beau Brummel Tailored man
you’re going to get the glad hand
every day——everywhere.

There’s No Use Talking

CLOTHES certainly do help make the man. Get
“off” the ready-mades. Have your clothes tailor-
ed expressly for you---get exactly what you want
without question or quibble.
