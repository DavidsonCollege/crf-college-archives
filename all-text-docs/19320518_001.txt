All Three Events of This Set Will Be

The annual tinal dances of the Pan-Hellenic
Council will be held the nights of May 31 and
June 1. These will naturally be the last set to
be under the supervision of the council that has
reigned for the year 1931-32.

The music will be furnished by
than our own local boys, E. B. Robinson and |
his North Carolinians. However, this orchestra |
will, for these dances, be one of eleven. pieces |
instead of the usual ten pieces, for Robert Orr,
of Asheville, who was with the old Sunnyland
Serenaders of last season, will be with them |
these twoo nights. This is of particular  inter-
est to the upperclassmen who will recall that |
Orr was the trombone player and could not
return to school this year because of his health,
It might be fitting to also mention here that
he will return next year and continue his usual
courses. Gene DuBose, Hed
vocalist, will be there to entertain in said man
ner. The North Carolinians have grown rather |
popular during the past few months, giving sev-
eral programs over station WBT in Char-
lotte, key of the Dixie Broadcasting |
System, and also playing for quite a few dances |
