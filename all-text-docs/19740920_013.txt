Frances Beaver, manager
of the laundry, feels that the
laundry can do a good job for
coeds. She handles most of the
women’s clothing as delicates,
washed ‘separately from the
men’s ‘and in home-type
washers.

Beaver said that there is one
free washer and dryer in the
laundry for student use during
business hours.

“In about two years, we
may go to just linens and
shirts and coin-operated ma-
chines, but are trying to phase
out gradually, as long-time

employers retire. We also
have two coin-operated ma-
chines to be installed in Belk,”’
she said.

Both Currie and Beaver said
that the laundry was still ad-
justing to having so many
students. Both also said that
they are anxious to help and
want the students to feel
satisfied with the laundry.

Currie and Beaver said that
the laundry may go over
totally to coin-operated

machines in a central location .

if there is continued demand

for them, but that would take ©

time. .

They also said that a cen-
tralized location would be
necessary for free machines
to permit the necessary super-
vision.

The Mountaineers use
basically a ground control of-
fense utilizing the triple op-
tion, but they can still throw

the ball. Occasionally they ff

will try to throw deep off of the
halfback option, trying to cat-
ch the defense unaware.

, The Wildcats warmed up for
Appalachian last Saturday in
a scrimmage with Newberry
College. The coaching staff
was not pleased with the way
the team responded in a game
situation.

“We didn’t play well, but
I’m not discouraged; it was
not for lack of talented players
or. inadequacies in the
system,”’ said Farrell.

“We had been working on
certain things in spring and
pre-season practice, and we
forgot those when we got in a
game situation.”

The potential for a good
Wildcat attack is present,
however, and at times during
the scrimmage, it showed.

Halfback Larry Hardaway
and offensive lineman Jim
Kleinfelder were singled out
by Farrell for their per-
formance during the scrim-

eon occasion, the whole of-
fensive line showed great

progress,” he added.

Gary Pomeroy and .Foney &

Mullins were injured during
the scrimmage, but both will
