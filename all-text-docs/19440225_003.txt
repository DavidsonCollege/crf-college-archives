The Cats Jeave for Raleigh this weck after spending two
weeks of misery abroad. Starting off the season with ten re-
liable players, the Cats received some heartbreaking losses.
Losing five of the ten ball players including Ed White and Dick
Chesson, they have staggered through the last two weeks with
five men playing nearly forty minutes a game. With three
freshmen in the starting lineup at the first of the vear and four
later on they have managed to win 16 out of 22 ball. games.

When they meet V. P. I. in the conference tournament Thurs-
day night they will have the wholchearted backing of the en-

tire student body— Regardless—af whether they win at—lase].

they will have had a very good season considering the circum-
stanees. They are our Cats. so,let’s support them.

Reminiscing

A great many people this year have liked to rem-
inisce and say that this year if it hadn’t been for the
war. old D. C. would be right up there in front in the
Southern Conference. Not only in basketball but in
football, track and tennis this would have been our
year. While it is a good thing to do, bringing back
stars like the Peters boys, and the rest of the sensa-
tional sophs, I think it only fair to send a bunch of
orchids to the boys who played football and who have
almost completed a successful basketball séason. The
football team would have won two or three games this
year if certain schools had not broken their word and
brought in players. So while we remember and think
of what it would have been like during peaceful years,
let’s also remember to praise these lads who have
frught against overwhelming odds all year and have |
done darn well. '

Up at Chapel Hill two weeks ago the Cats very appropri-
ately acquired the name, of “Roving Orghans”. Could it be
