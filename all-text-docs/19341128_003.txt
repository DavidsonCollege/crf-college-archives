TWO SPEAKERS
ADDRESS GROUP

Gamma Sigma Epsilon Hears
Program Given By Weeks
And Batte

Last Tuesday night at nine o'clock in
the chemical building, Gamma Sigma Ep-
silon, local chemical fraternity, held its
first meeting since the initiation of the
new members.

The program consisted of a paper by
K. D. Weeks on the tobacco industry, in
which he discussed its history, use, and
matters pertaining to the chemical nature
of tobacco itself, and its by-products.
Of particular interest was the brief dis-
cussion of nicotine, its chemical proper-
ties, and its comparative toxicity. This
was followed by a rather lengthy dis-
course on chemical warfare by Jim Batte.
This discourse consisted of a subdivision
of the different types of compounds and
mixtures used in said subject. In his dis-
cussion Batte used quite a bit of infor-
mation acquired during his period of
study at Edgewood arsenal last summer.
He-also related several practical and in-
teresting experiences encountered while
at this camp. It was clearly evident
from this talk that the United States
is more than adequately prepared chemi-
cally in the event of an emergency. This
discussion evoked quite a few interesting
questions from other members of the fra-
ternity present.

A short but important business meet-
ing followed this very enjoyable program.
Discussion of monthly dues, deputations
to nearby institutions, and the mineral
exhibit were the highlights of this busi-
ness meeting.

Due to changes made at the last meet-
ing, Gamma Sigma Epsilon will meet
at nine o'clock on alternating Tuesday
evenings instead of Monday, the previous
time. The next meeting will be held
Tuesday December fourth.

Weekly Program

Presented By Band

Friday evening.

ber “O! Davidson!” After this the band

more’s “Men of Ohio,” and “The Iron
Grip” by Haines,

Mr. F. L. Jackson, treasurer of the col-
lege, then reported on the conference on

held here during the earlier part of last
week, The presidents and business offi-
cers of twenty colleges in the two Caro-

cluded the broadcast.

Mrs. Cumming Speaks
To Group Of Students

An intimate talk which revealed a
number of the lesser known works and
qualities of the great American man of
letters, Nathaniel Hawthorne, was given
before advanced English students by Mrs.
W. P. Cumming last Friday morning.
Mrs, Cumming, for a number of years
a diliggnt student of Hawthorne, was in-
troduced by Dr, E. F. Shewmake.

The speaker revealed that she had for
many years lived in the very town where
Hawthorne spent most of the days of his
life and she had taken advantage of every
opportunity to study his works and his
life. Declaring that Salem, Mass. is a
“city of the past”, Mrs. Cumming told
a number of apt and amusing incidents
about the town and the odd personages
there.

Hawthorne, an introspective, recluse
for many years, lived in the quiet town
of Salem and there he wrote some of his
best literature, steeped in the environ-
ment of Puritan tradition. The great
author recorded every thought and ob-
servation of his and later transmuted
them into living works. These and other
interesting points were brought out by
the speaker.

Mrs. Cumming seemed to take particu-
lar interest in Hawthorne’s juvenile pub-
lication which he modeled after the
“Spectator” of Addison and Steele; he
even adopted their name for his journal.

Around "TOWN

tained Friday night at the home of Mrs.
R. S. Burwell.

giving holidays. They will spend the

Mrs. John T. Rhett.

Prof. and Mrs, William McGavock will
have as their guest during Thanksgiving
Mr. McGavock’s sister, Martha, who is a

A Thanksgiving program was given at

Adams is the teacher.

The Kill Kare Klub was entertained
at its regular meeting Thursday evening
by Miss Grace James.

nus of Davidson College.

Miss Sarah Withers, who is teaching
in the Garner High School, will come to
Davidson Wednesday to spend the
Thanksgiving vacation with her parents,
Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Withers.

Students Will Be In
Charge Of Vespers

The Y. M. C. A. is planning to make
an innovation at the regular Y Vesper
services next Sunday night. An especial
effort will be made-to give the students
a service in which they will all join.
With this aim in mind, the regular speak-
er will be dispensed with next Sunday
and the worship will be entirely in the
hands of the students.

The program will be a worship service
developing throughout a certain theme
which has not yet been decided on.
Hymns of a type calculated to appeal to
students will be sung from the Premier
hymn book to the accompaniment- of
both the piano and the organ. There will
also be scripture readings and a short
talk, both along the lines suggested by
the theme.

This type of program is being tried as
an experiment in an attempt to make the
Y. M. C. A. Vespers mean more to a
larger number of the student body. It
is thought that a variation in the regular
program might help in creating this in-
terest.

NORTH-BOUND NOTES

The Mooresville bumming ordinance
has recently been repealed by action of
the city government. It was previously
forbidden to bum within two hundred
yards of a filling station, among other
regulations, This rulé was rescinded to
facilitate the passage of Davidson stu-
dents to and from the city.

Some amusing excerpts from the New
Englander’s “Spectator” were read to the
class by the lecturer and inasmuch as she
has herself written a small book on the
subject of Hawthorne’s journals the
notes were particularly compelling to the
students,

Lack Of Interest Disbands

Old Philanthropic So

Retiring President Expresses
Hope That Society May
Be Reorganized

After almost ninety-eight years of ex-
istence, the Philanthropic Literary So-
ciety has disbanded. The reason for this
is the lack of interest and not enough
new men.

The first meeting of this society was
held June 22, 1937, in one of the rooms
in either Oak Row or Elm Row. There
were five men present at this meeting,
but by the end of the year, there were
about thirty members.

Two years later the motto, “Verite
Sans Peur,” was adopted. Several years
later, after many efforts the “Phi” hall
was built and dedicated on February 16,
1850. This hall still stands on the cam-
pus. The chandelier which hangs in the
hall is a duplicate of that one under
which Napoleon III and Eugenie de
Montigi were married.

Until a short time ago, Literary So-
cieties were the most important extra-
curricula activities on the campus, hav-
ing charge of all the publications and of
commencement exercises. Everyone be-
longed to one of the two societies. These
took the part of student government,
having a system almost identical with the
honor system of today, except they used
fines instead of suspension.

The. Philanthropic Literary
has had a continuous existence except for
a few years during the war between the
states.

There is a slight hope held by the pres-
ident, Cameron Deans, that the society
will be able to reorganize sometime in the
future.

Civic League Holds
Sale For Milk Fund

Canvas Of Dormitories Realizes
Forty Dollars For League

The Davidson Civic League held its
semi-annual rummage sale for the benefit
of charity last Saturday, November 24th.

This sale, one of the features of Dav-
idson life, consists of the gathering of all
kinds of clothing from every available
source and selling them at some down-
town store. The clothes are cleaned and
pressed free of charge by the Davidson
Laundry and repaired by a committee of
women before being offered for sale.

A group of seven boys composed of
Cc. B. Chapman, J. W. Dickson, F. S.
Furness, J. S. McMullen, J. M. Smith,
L. C. Vass, and W. M. Wicker gathered
clothes from all the dormitories. A good
supply of shoes, coats, shirts, ties, and
suits from the students helped to make
the profit from the sale this year the

Two deputations, one to Queens-Chi-
cora College and the other to Mitchell
College, were sent out by the “Y” this
week. Don Brailey was leader of the
Queens deputation, and Warner Dubose
was speaker. Warren Babcock furnished
a cello solo for the deputation, accom-
panied by Kenneth Scott at the piano.
At Mitchell College, in Statesville, Don
Brandon and Bob Coit closed a series of
four deputations the purpose of which
was to review a book by Dr. E. T.
Thompson on the history of missions in
the southern United States.

The first round of the “Y” ping-pong
tournament has been completed and the
winners are beginning the second rouhd
this week.

Due to the expense incurred by main-
taining the pool table and accessories at
the “Y,” it has been suggested that a
pool tournament be put on, each con-
testant contributing a small entrance fee
to defray maintenance expenses.
