Friday, October 11, 1985 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Who's On First ?

By ANDY BARRON

Last April I gave my predictions for
the 1985 baseball season in this very col-
umn. It doesn’t seem like six. months
have already gone by; but that is the na-
ture of the national pastime, to rush past
its fans in a blaze of glory.

Few seasons in the recent past have
been as entertaining to fans as the 1985
gan. There was something for every-

ne. Career milestones? Reggie Jackson
hit his SOOth home run, Rod Carew got
his 3000th hit, and Tom Seaver and Phil
Niekro got their 300th victories.

Underdogs? St. Louis, universally
ignored by pre-season prognosticators,
had the best record in baseball.

Hot hitters? Wade Boggs his .368 and
Willie McGee hit .353 to win the Ameri-
can and National batting titles, respec-
tively. , 5%

Power hitters? The American League
had 22 players hit 25 or more home runs;
the National League had 9.

Pitching? In addition to the unbeliev-
able heroics of Dwight Gooden (24-4,
1.53 ERA), John Tudor had 10 shutouts
in his 21-8 record, Orel Hershiser went

19-3, Ron Guidry went 22-6 and Bret
Saberhagen finished 20-6.

The 1985 season also had Pete Rose.
Rose collected his 4,192 hit in his long,
illustrious career to become baseball’s
greatest hitter of all time. By passing Ty
Cobb on the hit parade, Rose accom-
plished the greatest feat in baseball since
Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth’s home run
record in 1975.

While the

162-game season has

ended, the new extended version of the
play-offs remains. The league champion-
ship series have been extended from a
best-of-five to a best-of-seven format.

The good news this format brings is
the possibility for four extra games; the
bad new is that if the World Series goes to
a seventh game, it will be on Oct. 27th.
That’s an awfully cold time of year to be
playing baseball, especially in Toronto.

The tremendous success of last
week’s college football poll encourage
me to take a poll of baseball play-off pre-
dictions. As expected, the forecasters
were divided on who would win the
World Series. Generally the reasoning
behind the predictions were better than
the actual prediction.

Physics Professor Robert Manning
said Kansas City and St. Louis would
reach the World Series because “I hate
Los Angeles, both the place and the
team, and I don’t like the thought of a
Canadian team winning the World
Series.”

As usual, die hard fans refused to be-
lieve their team, or teams, were out of it.

Junior Mike Gross is ‘still predicting
subway series with the Yankees winning,
even though things look bad now.”

Junior Jay Wilkins made this poll
complete predicting the Braves would
win. No baseball poll in the south is
legitimate without someone saying the
Braves would win.

All in all, St. Louis was the clear fa-
vorite- in the National league among
Davidson’s baseball seers. Toronto re-
ceived more votes in the American

League than Kansas City, albeit, not
many more. World Series predictions,
however, were sharply divided. Anyone
who said Los Angeles would triumph in
the National League said the Dodgers
would also win the series. Almost no one
said Kansas City would win the series,
though many did think the Royals would
lose in the series. On the whole, David-
son fans picked St. Louis to beat To-
ronto, or vice versa, in the World Series.

Before I give my predictions, I'd like
to offend some people by leaving their fa-
vorite player off my All Star teams. As I
see it, the American League All-Stars
are: Don Mattingly of New York at first
base, Damaso Garcia of Toronto at sbc-
ond, Cal Ripken of Baltimore at
shortstop, Geroge Brett of Kansas City at
third (George would probably share third
with his good friend Wade Boggs of Bos-
ton), Carlton Fisk of Chicago at catcher,
Harold Baines of Chicago (outfield),
Ricky Henderson of New York (out-
field), Phil Bradley of Seattle (outfield),
Bret Saberhagen of Kansas City for a
right-handed starter, Ron Guidry of New
York for a left-handed starter and Dan
Quisenberry of Kansas City at relief
pitcher.

In the National League, my infield
would be first baseman Keith Hernandez
of New York, second baseman Ryne
Sandberg of Chicago, shortstop Ozzie
Smith of St. Louis, third baseman Mike
Schmidt of Philadelphia and catcher
Gary Carter of New York.

The outfield has four picks because I
can’t cut out any of these four players:

St. Louis Cardinals to win Series in six

Pedro Guerrero of Los Angeles, Dale
Murphy of Atlanta, Dave Parker of Cin-
cinnati, and Willie McGee of St. Louis.

For pitchers I would pick Dwight
Gooden of New York as a right-handed
starter, John Judor of St. Louis as a left-
handed stafter and Jeff Reardon of
Montreal for relief pitcher.

As far as the play-offs go, I agree
with soccer coach Charlie Slagle that
some team will be ahead in their series 3-
2 and end up losing 4-3, thereby being
denied a trip to the World Series by the
new play-off format. An I-70 series,
Kansas City versus St. Louis would be
nice, (I-70 being the interstate that links
these two cities on opposite sides of Mis-
souri). Kansas City is hot, Toronto is not;
but the Royals have no offense. Despite
the Royals beating Toronto in their sea-
son series (7-5), Toronto will fulfill my
April prediction by winning the series 4-
1. If there is a team likely to fulfill
Slagle’s ominous prediction, it is Kansas
City. Once their pitchers give out, good-
bye Royals.

St. Louis has hitting, speed, pitching
and a ball park suited to their style of
play. Los Angeles has pitching. I can’t
imagine Los Angeles stopping St. Louis’
volatile offense over a_ best-of-seven
series. St. Louis in five.

Toronto and St. Louis are similar
teams with similar styles. Yet the Na-
tional League thrives on pitching, while
the American League’s forte is hitting. In
the World Series pitching beats hitting.
The new champions of baseball will be
the St. Louis Cardinals in six games.

Blue Devils overpower Wildcat field hockey team

By EDWIN PAGE

Slow starts have plagued the
Davidson women’s field hockey
team all year, and Tuesday against
a powerful Duke team, the Cats
once again failed to get out of the
blocks in time. On a day in which
they could ill afford anything but
an all-out effort, the Cats were
doomed by their early lackluster
play.

Duke controlled the game
throughout the first half. The en-

tire half was played right in front
of the Davidson goal. Every
Davidson run was shut down at
midfield by the Duke halfbacks
and turned back toward the
Wildcat goal. Davidson goalie
Nana Lay was under constant
siege throughout the half while at
the other end the Duke goalie got
lonely.

The stickwork and passing of
Duke were impeccable as they
dominated play. By the end of the

first half, Duke had racked up five
goals and the outcome was al-
ready evident. Davidson coach
Patty Daley felt the Cats were in-
timidated at the outset. “We didn’t
do the things we are capable of
doing,” Daley said. “We worried
too much about them and didn’t
focus on our own game.”

As they have done several
times this year, Davidson righted
themselves at the half and came
out looking like a much improved

team. Duke’s wealth of talent was
still evident in their play, but the
Cats began to muster a little of-
fense of their own. Some of the
drives that had been stifled at mid-
field all day began to get through
as sophomore Janet Bitter and the
other Davidson forwards pres-
sured the Duke halfbacks.

While Duke continued to con-
trol the ball the majority of the
time, Davidson mounted several
legitimate challenges on the Blue

Devil cage. Duke pushed two into
the Davidson goal during the sec-
ond half, but it was a far cry from
their domination of the first
stanza. Overall, the Cats simply
failed to play their best hockey
against the finest team they have
faced this season, making for a
predictable outcome.

Next Wednesday, the Cats
take on Appalachian State at 4
p.m. at Davidson.
