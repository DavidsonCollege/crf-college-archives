‘By Warren Buford

After two weeks of practice,
the rugby team took to the field for
their first games of the season Sat-
urday. Traveling to UNCC,
Davidson split two games against
' the 49ers, losing the first 12-6 and
then winning the second 17-7.

Co-captain Simon Priestly
said, “‘ourteam went outand played
greatrugby. Although many of the
players were new, and slightly in-
experienced, we still made a great
showing for Davidson.” Priestly
scored 13 points on the day for the
Wildcats.

Joining Priestly in playing well
was co-captain Tom Shelburne,
who made some excellent and
clutch tackles. Dave Derrick, Rob
Vogelbacher, and Sean Harvey also
had played well. Freshmen who
played well include: Barrot Ross,
Hank Ackerman, Pete Schulze, Ben
Wall, Westley Hart among others.

“The games on Saturday
should be a good indication that
Davidson will have a dynaminte
rugby season,” said rugby presi-
dent Mike Kessler. Make sure to
come and support the “ruck-n-
rollin” rugby team when they tackle
Chapel Hill Saturday for Home-
coming.
