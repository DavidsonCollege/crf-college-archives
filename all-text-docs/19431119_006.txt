ment. -(Eyes always~ played by
Boris Karloff). Our hero (whom
we shall Percival, because that is
not his name) chooses the left stair-
case. As he reaches the top step,
another ear-splitting scream rings
out. He turns just in time to see
two hairy arms close tightly about
the head of a lovely maiden on the
other staircase! Then all goes black
—it’s a pre-view.

that: Whitey has been down, and
We know that Whitey has been
squeling, but Whitey couldn’t know
that). nh

To continue . . . Whitey senses
the tension in the air. He rushes
over to Duke and falls on _ his
knees, pleading vehemently for his
life. Duke Stands above him, flip-
