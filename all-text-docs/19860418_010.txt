Women’s tennis puts forth tremendous effort

By EDWIN PAGE

The women’s tennis team had
a busy and trying week on the
courts as they played fiye matches
in the course of eight days and lost
all but one of them.

Last Wednesday, the team
traveled to Wake Forest. Coach
Caroline Brown had hoped to pick
up at least two points from the
Deacons, but the Cats were
thrashed 9-0. Freshman Marion
Stone put up the best fight for
Davidson as she won her first set
and went up 4-0 in the second be-
fore eventually falling.

On Friday, the Cats squared
off against UNC-Greensboro in
the only win of the week. Playing
without usual number one player
sophomore Amy McNelis, the
team nevertheless rolled to an
easy 7-2 victory. Stone, playing at
number one singles, lost and the
number one doubles team of Stone

Davidson

By SUSAN WILKINS

After an important weekend of
away conference matches, the
Wildcats played two easy non
conference matches this week to
raise their overall record to 197,
just (Wo victories shy of equaling
last year’s record of 21-10

The Cats went into their three
conference matches 1-1 and came
out 4-1. beating East Tennesee
State, Virginia Military Institute
and Western Carolina this past
weekend. Coach Jeff Frank said
that Davidson played extremely
well, proving that although young
the Wildcats have the guts to win.

In the first match (all were
played at VMI) Davidson was up
against ESTU. ETSU is an ex-
tremely good team and should get
a high seed in the conference tour-
nament. Davidson played superb
tennis to win 6-3.

All the singles matches, ex-
cept at the number five seed, went
into three sets, proving the two
teams were evenly matched.
Davidson junior Michael Meyer
was the only singles player to win
In straight sets over his opponent.
Frank says that Meyer is playing
close to the top of his game, and
beginning to overpower his oppo-
nents.

Also playing well in singles
were junior Hayes Dallas and
senior Craig Hall. According to
Frank, Dallas won a great match,
playing smart tennis to beat an op-
ponent whose strength was unbe-
lievable. Hall, coming back from
a shoulder injury, started slowly,
but managed to work his way back
into the match to win.

The Wildcats next played
Western Carolina, winning easily
9-0. Meyer once again played
well, demolishing his opponent 6-
0, 6-0. Number one sophomore
Jim Thompson, coming off a three
set loss, won easily 6-4, 6-1.
Other winners were freshman

and freshman Jane Price also lost.
Everywhere else, the team

dominated. At number two,
senior captain Lolly Johnson
cruised to a 6-1, 6-1 victory.

Junior Debbie Podolin won 6-2,
6-2 at number three, and freshman
Martha Johnson also won at
number four. Price won easily 6-
3, 6-4 at number five and
freshman Alice Stubbs added
another point with a 7-6, 6-2 vic-
tory. The numbers two and three
doubles teams of L. Johnson/
Stubbs and freshman Flora Robin-
son and junior Stephanie
Townsend added the sixth and
seventh points to close out the
match.

On Sunday, after receiving
news that they would not be al-
lowed to participate in the South-
ern Conference tournament, the
team took the court against
Emory, a team that they had

beaten 7-2 just over a week be-
fore. Stone won at number two 6-
3, 6-1, Podolin, playing at
number four, won 7-6, 7-5, and
Price closed out the singles play
with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 victory to
make the score 3-3 going into dou-
bles play.

Davidson, however, could not
pick up another point as they lost
all three doubles matches giving
Emory a 6-3 win. It was the first
time Davidson had lost to Emory,
and it marked only the second loss
in Division III play in four years of
competition for the Cats.

Tuesday, things continued to
go badly for the team as they
traveled to Furman. Davidson-
Furman matches have been very
close over the past few years, and
Brown was expecting a 5-4 score
one way or another. Instead, the
team found itself on the wrong

side of a 7-2 score. The only
Davidson points came from Lolly
Johnson at number three 7-5, 6-2
and from Price at number six 6-2,
6-1.

On Wednesday, Brown tried
to shake up the line-up against
UNCC by pulling out her numbers
one, two, and four players. Lolly
Johnson, playing number one,
won easily 6-1, 6-3. Price, moved
up to number three, won 6-3, 6-2,
and Stubbs won at number four, 6-
4, 6-2. Martha Johnson, junior
Libby Sanders and freshman
Angela Rudert at numbers two,
five, and six lost to make the score
3-3 after singles play.

Once again, the Cats could not
pull out the match in the doubles
winning only one point courtesy
of Townsend and Robinson who
won 6-1, 6-4 while playing what

ups conference record to 41

Sebastian Koch at the number six
position, 6-2, 6-0; Dallas at the
number two position, 6-1, 6-0;
sophomore Bill Young at number
three, 6-3. 6-1; Hall at
number four, 6-2. 6-2. Davidson

and

also swept its doubles matches.

After playing WCU at9a.m.,
Davidson had to play VMI at 2
p.m. The Cats came back strong
to win again 9-0. This match, al-
though not close, was closer than
the WCU match.

Young gave the Wildcats their
only singles scare, dropping the
first set 3-6 before coming back to
blow by his opponent 6-1, 6-2 in
the next two sets. Thompson won
6-4, 6-1; Dallas won 6-0, 6-0;
Hall won 6-1, 6-1; Meyer won 6-
2, 6-0; and Koch won his singles
match 6-2, 6-0.

In doubles, the Cats have been
improving and it showed against
VMI. The number one team of
Dallas and Young dragged out
their first set, so as not to
humiliate their opponents, and
lost it 5-7. They settled down to
business in the next two sets, win-
ning 6-0, 6-1. The other doubles
teams had no pity on the VMI
Keydets; Thompson and Caldwell
at number two won 6-3, 6-3,
while Hall and Meyer at number
three won 6-1, 6-3.

This past Monday, — the
Wildcats were at home against
Pfeiffer, not a very strong team.
Frank took this opportunity to let
some reserve players for David-
son get in some playing time.
Caldwell played at number six
singles, moving Meyer and Koch
up to numbers four and five re-
spectively. In doubles, Thompson
and Caldwell played at the
number one postion, while Young
and Meyer teamed at number two.
Koch and sophomore Carlos
Ortega, who usually do not play
doubles, came in at the number
three spot. i

Sophomore Bill Young hits a forehand

As expected, everyone won;
most fairly easily. Thompson won
his first set 6-2, but dropped the
second 4-6. He then toughened up
and won quickly in the third set 6-
2. Dallas won 6-3, 6-1, playing
lots of short points to win. Young,
a very consistent player, won 6-4,
6-1.

Meyer, playing at number
four, devastated his opponent 6-0,
6-0, playing power tennis and en-
joying it. Koch, at number five,
went up quickly in the first set 4-1,
before dropping two games. He
corrected some minor problems in
his groundstrokes and bounced
back to win 6-3, 6-1. Caldwell, a
magnificent doubles player,
played magnificent singles to win
6-0, 6-2.

In doubles, Caldwell and
Thompson won a scary first set
and then a easy second to win at
number one 7-6, 6-1. Young and
Meyer won 6-1, 6-3 and Koch

teamed with Ortega to win 6-2, 6-
2.

Davidson traveled to Belmont
Abbey on Tuesday for another
easy match. The Cats only loss
came at number one singles — a
tough position against any team.
Thompson played well, but lost 4-
6, 6-2, 2-6. Frank went with the
same line-up against Belmont
Abbey that he did against Pfeiffer,
and everyone else won. The final
match score was 8-1.

Davidson has a tough match
coming up against Furman, the
number one seed in the confer-
ence. Frank hopes to do well, but
says that if the Cats cannot win he
hopes for each individual match to
be close, giving Davidson added
confidence going into the South-
ern Conference tournament.

In the tournament, Davidson
expects to do well. Young and
Meyer both have undefeated re-

Brown called their best match as a
team.

Despite the loss, Brown
praised the team as putting forth a
“tremendous effort.” That David-
son gave UNCC such a close
match playing without three of its
top six players is a testament to the
depth of talent on this year’s
squad.

Reflecting on the week,
Brown said, “We made a trade-
off. We’ ve been turning a lot of at-
tention to an examination of the
women’s program. We are seek-
ing a clarification of the situation
and that takes a lot of time, effort
and energy. Starting Sunday
night, the bottom fell out. Against
Emory and Furman, we worked as
hard as we could. That was the
best that we could have played at
that moment. We just didn’t have
enough energy.”

cords in conference matches and
should be seeded high. Young is
the defending champion at
number three position. Frank says
that Davidson has traditionally
done better in the tournament than
during the season, so if this season
is any indicator, the Wildcats
should play superbly.

If not this year, then next.
Next year the conferences’ strong
teams will have lost a lot of
players, while Davidson will only
lose Hall. Davidson also is re-
cruiting the top two players in
South Carolina, and with sopho-
more Rick Hodge and freshman
Blake O'Brien back after injury
and illness kept them out this year,
the Cats look to be strong conten-
ders next year for the conference
title.

Davidson travels to Furman
this Friday, returning home Mon-
day to play Johnson C. Smith in

their last home match. The match
starts at 2 p.m.
