DAVIDSON STUDENTS TO
ATTEND CONVENTION

All of the students who can possibly
do so are urged to take advantage of
the opportunity to attend the Laymen’s
Convention in Charlotte on February
1@, 17 and 18.

On Wednesday the students are to at-
tend in a body and it is desired that the
Davidson delegation be as large as pos-
sible. The registration fee of one dol
lar will not be charged any of the stu-
dents and they will be admitted to all
of the sessions, a special place being re-
served for them.

On account of the small number of
men who agreed to go down on Wednes-
day morning a special train could not
be arranged for. However, if enough
of the students arrange to go in a body
at that time they themselves can make
arrangements for a train for the trip
through the student body officials.

All of the Davidson students are re
quested to meet at the Second Presby
terian church on Wednesday morning,
immediately after arrival of the train,
and go ina body to the convention hall.
where a place will be arranged for them,

Mr. Jackson went down to Charlotte
Mondav to complete the arrangements
for the attendance of the Davidson st
dents at the convention and to arrange
far sleening and cating quarters — for
those whe will be present. An arrange
ment was made whereby the students
can get meals and ‘a raon at $1.75 per
dav. For fell tefermation on the sub
tect cither Mir. Farkcan f. P. Williams.

sign up and attend, since this will- be
the principal event of the vear for the
Sophomores and all of the members of
the class should show an active interest
in it.

Six speakers have been selected by
Toastmaster, McKay, but’ since all of
them have not definitely accepted, it ts
impossible toa publish the list just now.

ulty will be held in a short time.

Davidson Quintette
Breaks Even In Series

Wins In First Game With Charlotte
But Loses Second.

FIRST GAME.

Last “Thursday afternoon at 4 o'clock
the Davidson basket ball team met the
strong team from the Charlotte Y. M.
C. A. and defeated them by a count of
37 to 25. The game was hard fought
hy both sides throughout, “The David-
son hoys were in excellent form and by
superior passing and teamwork they held
the lead throughout the game. One of
the features of the playing: was that it
was clean sport; there were very few
fouls in the whole game. For Davidson
Hengeveld plaved a star game at center,
while the work of Somerville at— for-
ward and Walker at guard were com-
iendable. ‘The work of the whole
team owas splendid. For Charlotte,
Stewart at forward and McClintock at
guard, starred.

‘This is the second time that the strong
team from Charlotte has been defeated
this vear, and the local team) deserves
uch credit for their work, It avas the
fires pame that has been plaved on the
Hill for same time, and it is hoped that
there will be some more good ones play-
ed here this sprinu. Line up:

DAVIDSON LOSES SECOND GAME.

Ina hard fought game of basket ball
Charlotte defeated Davidson Saturday
sicht by the score of 7H to 9g, before a

large audience in the Charlotte Y. M.

C. A. gymnasium. “The Charlotte team
wis determined to get revenge for their
defeat last ‘Thursday, and used the very
hest material to he found in the city.
‘The entire game was fast and) snappy.

and although Charlotte kept the tead,

the Red and Black quintette -plaved a
hard and steady game until the referee’s
whistle ended the contest.

The fact that the game was plaved
at nieht was of a great disadvantage to
Davidson, as the team has practised and
olaved entirely by dav light, which ac-
counted for so few goals being made.

Davenport and Stewart for Charlotte
plaved star ball, while Reese and Childs
plaved a goad eame for Davidson.

Tt is honed that the tie can be nlaved
off coon: at present the nlace of the con-
tect has not heen arreed upon.

Those an the trim were Somerville,
Reece, Childs Howell, Carson, Henge-
veld and Walker.

On January 18 the Executive Com-
mittee of the Alumni Association met
with Dr. Lafferty, its president, in
Charlotte, and formulated plans for es-
tablishing alumni associations at Wil-
mington, Asheville, Fayetteville | and
Greensboro. A member of the faculty.
probably the college President, will en-
deavor to meet with these associations
and address them at intervals in order
to keep the old’ students in touch with
college affairs.
