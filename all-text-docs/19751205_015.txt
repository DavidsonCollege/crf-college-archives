the davidsonian

Some people go to Davidson
football and basketball games
to watch the game. Others go
to watch the cheerleaders.

The Davidson cheeleading
squad is more than entertain-
ment. They are an organized
team of individuals who take
their job seriously.

“T hate to see people think
of the traditional stereotype of
a cheerleader that says if
you’re a cheerleader you have
an inferior mentality,’ said
one member.

Led by their captain Carol
Connors the squad consists of
Shaune Robertson, Howard
Payne, Susan Baynard, Bob
Schermer, Kathy Wilson and
Bill Vaughn, Jane Perkins and
Dick Boehner, Andrea
Murphy and Ed Crossland.

All but two of the girls have
been cheerleaders outside of
Davidson. None of the men
have had previous cheer-
leading duties.

The squad attends all of the
home games and many of the
away games. They practice a
minumum of three times a
week before every game.

In August six of the mem-
bers attended a cheerleading
camp at the University of
Tennessee at Knoxville. Along
with teams from other schools
they underwent a week of
intensive training.

They worked continually
from 8 a.m. until 9 p.m. in the
hot, muggy Knoxville
weather. ‘‘We were sore,’’ one
member commented, ‘‘but
camp was definitely worth it,
especially to those who have
never have been cheerleaders

before,” she added.
As tangible proof of the

+

Davidson fans hard to please

Cheerleaders accept difficult task —

team’s progress they carried
away two ribbons for perfor-

mance, one homorable men-

tion and one excellent, in the
nightly rating sessions.

With all of the effort that
the squad puts into cheering,
some members feel that the
Davidson student body is
behind them ‘‘only when we're
winning.” He added that it

keep on cheering. We realize
this and so we still try whether
or not anybody in the stands
do.”

The squad works with a
budget of approximately
$1200 with a $250 uniform
expense. Most of the money is
spent on travelling to games
away from school.

Cheerleading is played down

takes a great deal to please the
average Davidson fan.

During basketball season
the crowds usually don’t need
to be led in cheers. But the
Davidson fans are fairly tradi-
tional. The squad learned
many new cheers at camp but
cannot get the students inter-
ested in any but the older
cheers. ‘‘We’d just like the
students to participate more.”

The hardest part of cheer-
leading that the team has
encountered thus far has been
to keep on cheering when the
team is loosing. ‘‘But we're
supposed to be the ones to

at Davidson. Yet the squad is
enthusiastic about the prog-
ram. “Everyone on the squad
really enjoys what they’re
doing, and ther’s a lot of spirit
in the group. Everyone feels a
kind of responsibility to the
school.’

Most of the members cheer
in order to have fun and to get
some exercise. “‘When we get
out there we really don’t want
to perform; we just want
people to get involved.”’

What do they have to say to

. the Davidson Campus, to the

world? One member answered
simply, ‘‘Rah!”’
