“By October, I
_ began to realize that I,
_ too, was really enjoying
myself in Paris. Yes,
perhaps I should have
. gone somewhere else,
~ and yes, I still do won-
_ der what I was doing
. there, but I was happy.
My realization of my
enjoyment occurred
@« (quite suddenly and
" « unexpectedly —I had
fallen in love with

“Noche de Campanas. One
night, all of the bells in the
churches in the old part of
Madrid rang at once. It was
drizzling, and I followed a
procession of people with
umbrellas as we wandered
from church to church,
guided by the sound. Some
bells clanged like kitchen
pots while others rang
deeply and sonorously.”

“Just as the jet-lag was dissipating
_ and I began to pick up the habit of the mid-day sies-
_ ta, I received an email from the program director seek-
ing a student willing to tutor English to a three
year-old Spanish child several times a week.
I don’t know what it was that compelled
me, a quasi-Spanish-speaking, totally
lost and stuttering fool, to respond to
the message.”

“After visiting the famous
mosque in Djenne, hiking
through the Dogon country,
bathing in a waterfall and
taking a pirogue ride
across the Niger River, I a
am glad now that I am ani Fi : Sean
back home with my bio-
logical family, but I don’t
know any other country
other than Mali where I
felt so at home-away-
from-home.”

That word has been
yelled at me fre-

“My quently this fall,
second usually accompa-
: night in nied by little chil-

dren running and
pointing at me. To
translate for you,
‘umlungu’ is Zulu
for ‘white person.’
The term is not
degrading or insult-
ing, but a surprised
announcement of an
uncommon sighting.
The greetings and
smiles I receive as I walk down the street remind me of
Davidson’s friendly atmosphere.”

Bolivia, while
we were at a bon-
fire, the tiny little boy
plopped into my lap and
fell asleep. For reasons I still
don’t understand we began a
relationship unlike any I’ve
ever experienced.”
