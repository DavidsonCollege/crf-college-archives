Women's Basketball Gains Experience
In Scrimmage Against Belmont Abbey

By Stuart Smalley

A somewhat unprepared
Davidson women’s basketball
team met its first intercollegiate
competition in five years Tuesday
in an informal scrimmage’ with
Belmont Abbey.

Though somewhat over-
matched and suffering noticeably
from a lack of practice, the Wild-
cats turned in a scrappy perform-
ance, losing 22-11 and 18-13 ina
pair of ten minute quarters at the
end of the scrimmage.

The team had experienced less
than a weck of organized practice,
since several members of the team
played fall sports (and coach John
Filar was occupied as assistant
volleyball coach), and it showed.

They looked ragged through-
out the evening, commiting nu-
merous turnovers and looking
somewhatconfused on offense, but
that was to be expected. Adding to
their problems was the fact that
they playeda Belmont Abbey team
that wasan NAIA Sectional Cham-
pion a year ago.

During much of the scrim-
mage, Davidson could do little to
stop the Belmont Abbey offense.
The Wildcats had trouble contain-
ing the Belmont Abbey post play-
ers, and their sagging defense left
the Belmont Abbey guards open
for baseline jump shots.

Nonetheless, there were bright
spots for Davidson. Onecame with
9:45 remaining in the penultimate

quarter, when senior Skye
MacLeod’s two free throws gave
the Wildcats a2-0 advantage, their
first lead of the 1990’s.

They held the lead for some 6
minutes, even pushing it to 7-2
when senior Faison Nuckolls
scored on an offensive rebound
with 7:00 left. But the full-court

press brought Belmont Abbey

back; they converted numerous
steals into easy baskets, and ran
away with a 22-11 win.

The final period saw the ‘Cats’
first comeback of the decade.
Belmont Abbey jumped out to a6-
1 lead, but Davidson crept back
into the game. After Katrina

O*Neill’s putback basket made it ”

6-3, Courtney Robertson tied the

Hess Makes Sweet Sixteen
At ITCA Southeast Regional

Davidsonian Staff Reports

Number one player Cyndi
Hess, in one of the finest individ-
ual performances in) Davidson
women’s tennis history, won two
matches to advance to the third
round of the highly competitive
Rolex ITCA Regional Champion-
ship last weekend in Greensboro.
The ITCA Regional in Greensboro
was one of eight regional tourna-
ments across. the country. that
matched the finest players in each
region in individual competition.

The 12 individual seeds in the
tournament were garnered primar-
ily by players from ACC programs
and South Carolina, many of them
in or near the national top 25. The
finalists in the singles draw of 64
and the 32-team doubles draw
advanced to the ITCA National

> Championship to be held later this

year in Minneapolis.

Hess’ two wins marked the
first time a Davidson woman had
ever advanced beyond the first
round of the tournament. In the

- first round, she whipped Kim

Touhey of East Tennessee State,

_ 6-2,6-0. She thrashed Alex Simm

of Louisville by an identical score
in her second round match. Hess
finally fell to defeat in the third
round, losing by a6-2, 6-3 score to
8th-seeded Angela Bernal of North
Carolina.

and Tasha Ruth both suffered first ..

round setbacks at the hands of Duke

' players, while Wildcat freshman

Kimberley Nance lost to 12th-
seeded Elisha Portnoy of .UNC.

Barbara Grooms advanced to the
second round when their UNCG

ret.). They lost in the secondound
toa Clemson doubles team ranked
in the top 20 in the nation. The
other Davidson doublesentry, Hess
and Nance, lost in the opening.
round to a top.20 team from Duke.

pressed with Hess’ performance,
and also saw the value of the tour-
nament as a learning experience
for her players. Price character-
ized theeventas “a fun challenge.”

game witha fast-break three-point
play. MacLeod’s two free throws
gave the ‘Cats a 10-8 lead with
2:15 left, and the game went back
and forth into the final minute,
whenalate run by the Abbey sealed
the 18-13 outcome.

Still, Filar was content. with
the scrimmage. Considering the
lack of practice time and the very
youth of the program, not much
could have been expected from
their first game.

But Davidson did turn inva
consistently intense performance,
prompting Filar to say that he was
“pleased with the effort.” Nuck-
olls led the Wildcats with 10 points
and 9 rebounds;, MacLeod also

. scored 10 and grabbed 7 boards.
