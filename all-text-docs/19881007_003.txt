Area Restaurants

Homecoming is a traditional time to go out to eat for both students and alumni, and the booming .
development around Lake Norman has given Davidsonians an opportunity to eat anywhere up and
down the scale of formality.

wants chicken, someone else wants
seafood, and. someone wants beef.
Before you throw your hands up in
the air and mutter something about
McDonald’s, consider the Lotus Res-
taurant in Mooresville as a possible
answer to your problems:

Not only does the Lotus serve a
variety of entrees, but they are pre-
pared to suit your style. Meals range
from Mandarin, Szechuan, and
Hunan to Cantonese type dishes and
may be flavored from hot and spicy to
mild. A cup of egg drop soup (person-

Aside from the pleasant dining at-
mosphere and good service, another
Lotus attraction lies in a reasonable
price list. Dinners range from 6.95 to
9.95, and just in case you’re running
short on cash, they will even accept
your personal checks!

Finally, for those. students previ-
ously_unacquainted with. this dining
establishment, the Lotus’s location is
easily accessible from campus. Sim-

115.Once you enter town, takea left at

Follow this road for approximately
two miles until it forks, (you will be

“If you don’t take me to Lizzie’s, some-
body else will,” reads the phrase printed on
matchbook covers and check stubs. We

hope someone does, for the entire experi-

ence is well worth the money.

Empress of China
- Just minutes from campus,
the Empress of China offers a
popular oriental menu featur-
ing Cantonese, Mandarin,
Hunan, and Szechuan foods.
The cozy two room dining
area is traditionally fur-
fies nished, complete with gilded
. arches and decorated shades.
Strangely enough, the piped-

in music is not oriental but of

the “elevator music” variety.
Dress is casual, but one would not
feel out of place in “Homecom-
ing attire.” The atmosphere is

quaint enough for two, yet open

enough for larger groups.
The menu consists of soups

(about $1.25), appetizers (from

'$1.25 to $4.75), and a large vari-
ety of dinners (prices ranging «

from $6.75 to $9.95). A dinner for.
two, including soup, egg rolls,

- wine, and two main courses, was

'

about $25 + tip. For the discrimi-
nating palate, Empress of China
also offers vegetarian dishes and
American dinners. Alcohol is
served to those of age (I.D. will be
checked). Portions are large, so be
prepared to eat. Overall, the food
is tasty and plentiful, althoug# it
could have been hotter. Both
lunch and dinner are served.

In terms of service, waiters and

waitresses abound--you may find
yourself constantly bombarded
with the question, “Is everything
alright?” Although very prompt,
they are not overly polite. In fact,
if you wish to take home left-
overs, you have to box it yourself.
Nicely dressed people may find
this a problem.

All in all, two thumbs up.

Norman’s

Yes, it’s a hotel/motel, but the
Holiday Inn in Comelius also
offers Norman’s Restaurant
which you should consider when
making Homecoming plans this
year. If you'll be getting dressed
up and want to eat a lot of good
food for .a reasonable price, this
could be the place. .

Although there are several en-
trees on the menu, the best: bet
(and best value) is the prime rib
buffet, only $13.95. For this one

price you get cheese and crackers, .

hot rolls and butter, salad bar,

cold shrimp and clams, a chicken

entree, a seafood entree, several
vegetables including baked pota-
toes, and at least three desserts.
While the exact selection varies
somewhat from day to day, there
is always a wide variety and lot of
it. It’s all-you-can-eat, so tell your
date to plan ahead and not eat

anything all day before going in
order to get more than yom
money’s worth!

The atmosphere in the dining
room is semi-formal, which is to

say anything in the range of

“Homecoming attire’ would be-
appropriate. It’s quiet enough to
carry on an intimate conversation
with your date, yet the buffet style
relieves you of the responsibility
of remembering which course
goes with which fork.

As far as bars, the Holiday Inn
has its own version, Pour Nor-
man’s, another hot spot you might
wish to check out.

Inn is really one of the best and
most reasonably priced “fine din-

it’s practically as close as our own

movie posters. But if you sit to
