Pops plans June retirement,8
brings gym tradition to end |

By MARK SCANDLING
Staff Writer

Norman Emerson who is
better known as ‘‘Pops”, has
only been at Davidson for four
years, yet when he retires in
June, another tradition will
have ended.

“Pops”’ is that little old man
who checks for student ID’s at
the football and basketball
games. He also runs the
now-controversial basket
room, and during the summer
months, he heads to work on
the athletic fields with the
other four members of the
close-knit gym maintenance
staff.

After finishing construction
of his own house in Hunters-
ville in 1972, Norman came
out of ‘‘semi-retirement’’ and
started working in Johnston
Gym. Right from the start,
the students nicknamed him
“Pops’’.

Over the past four years, he
says he~has- met a lot of
‘wonderful young people’’ and
he has made lasting friend-
ships.with many of them.

He and his wife have be-
come really attached both to
the college and the town of
Davidson. He said, ‘‘We like

Davidson, it is a beautiful
friendly town. Our hearts are
wrapped up in Davidson.”

Davidson athletics, espec-
ially basketball, have also
secured a place in Pops’ heart.
Both he and his wife are avid
fans. He added that his wife
‘would crawl to be able to see
a game.”’

Pops figures that Davidson
is on its way back to the top in
basketball, for he believes it is
getting the right combination
of “wonderful coaches, good
players, and student sup-
port.’’ He also figures to be
around to see the return to the
top.

Being at Davidson has giv-
en Pops to devote more time to
his love for music. He reg-
ularly attends the concerts
held on the campus. However,
his love of music is not
restricted just to listening, he
also plays the saxophone.

Bach and Beethoven are his
favorite composers, and he
spends many hours sitting in
the basket room with sheet
music before him. In the near
future he hopes to team up
with Dr. Dockery and give a
public performance.

For now his public perform-

benefit of the purists of the
sport, the tally was 46-19,

In regard to trivialities, the
Campus Nasties proved to be
a misnomer when. 2nd

and Barbie ‘‘Where’s the

havoc in their first outing as
officials.

As far as we know, they
were the first girls to don the
black and white for an IMAC
contest. Their job was credible
and they received no com-
plaints with the exception of
the fact’ that they did not
know from which line the
teams were supposed to kick
off.

Due to the significance of
this historical event the score
of the game almost escaped
notice. The bouncing bullies of
3rd Little swept the flitting
fu-fus of 2nd Watts-under the
rug; 12-0.

ances are restricted to playing
with the Wildcat Pep Band.
His job prevents him from
playing at campus games, but
he tries to play with the band
at all of the Coliseum games.

When Pops retires on June
first, he says he ‘‘won’t be
ready to hit the rocking chair
for a long time.’’ He has a
four-acre lot to clear and
landscape, he has his music,
and he is now developing a
new interest in stained glass.

Most importantly he has
got his friends and interests at
Davidson, and he warmly
remarked that ‘‘as long as God
gives me my health, I’ll con-
tinue to take part in the
activities and sporting events
at Davidson.”

Davidson Booters drop pair

By DOUG SCHUESSLER

A lack of concentration
continues to plague the Wild-
cat soccer team as it dropped
its fourth and fifth consecutive
matches this past weekend.

The double loss also dealt a
severe blow to pre-season
hopes of a possible Southern
Conference championship, as
both defeats came at the
hands of conference foes.

The team opened its two
game road trip against a tough
William and Mary squad. The
lack of offensive pressure by
-Davidson strikers kept the
Cats on defense throughout
the match.

Defensive mistakes led to
three W&M scores as David-
son fell by a score of 3-0.

Sunday’s match versus
VMI was considerably more
encouraging. The offense,
which had totalled only. one
goal in their first four mat-
ches, suddenly came to life.

Ten minutes after the open-
ing kick-off striker Dave Pat-
ton rifled a shot from thirty
yards into the.right:corner of
the goal. The 1-0 lead, how-

ever, did not stand up for
long. Mental lapses resulted in
two quick VMI scores.

Moments later the Cats .

received a big break when a
third VMI goal was called
back for offsides. The half
ended with VMI in front by a
score of 2-1.

Twenty minutes into the
second half VMI once again
took advantage of mental
mistakes by Davidson defen-
ders and netted their third
score of the match. The Da-

vidson offense immediately
bounced back with intense
pressure on the Keydet goal.

The pressure finally paid off
as winger Paul Schleiffer
slammed home a breakaway to
close the gap to 3-2. However,
a total of 29 second half shots
on goal failed to produce the
tying score as VMI squeezed
out the victory.

The Cats open their home
season against the University
of North Carolina (at Char-
lotte) on Wednesday, Oct. 6.
