Board Redefines Student Conduct

By RICH WILSON

At a special meeting June
22, the board of trustees re-
affirmed the Code of Re-
sponsibility and approved
the governance report on
student conduct, which call-
ed for the establishment of
a Student Conduct Council
and a restructuring of the
judiciary system.

Dealing first with the Code
of Responsibility, the trus-
tees said that the code was
a sound statement of the
philosophy and standards of
student conduct.

b.

However, they felt the
lines of authority from the
trustees to persons and agen-
cies on the campus were not
Clear, and that the enforce-
ment structure was unwieldy
and faulty.

The_ trustees therefore
concluded that major por-
tions of the code should be
reaffirmed, but that the
parts dealing with policy-
making and judiciary func-
tions be redesigned.

Taking the first step
toward redefining the entire
system of college govern-

ment, the board transfered
the policy-making function
for student conduct from the
faculty to the president and

to a newly-established Council

on Student Conduct.

This council is composed
of the Dean of Students, who
will serve as chairman, the
Coordinator of Student Acti-
vities, eight faculty members
(some selected from the four
areas and others elected at
large), the Student Govern-
ment President and Vice
President, the presidents of
the four classes, and two

upperclass students who are
not members of the senate
and who are elected at large
by the student body.

The council is empowered
to amend the standards set
by the Code of Responsibility
by a majority vote, provid-
ing the proposed amend-
ment does not contravene
trustee policy.

In such a case the college
president would suspend
operation of the amendment
pending review by the trus-
tees or the trustee executive
committee. If the board does
not act on the amendment
within 30 days, the amend-
ment will become operative.

The council will also ad-
vise the college administra-
tion on matters of policy re-
lating to student conduct
and disciplinary proceedings,
and may recommend changes
in the enforcement’ me-
chanism and procedure.

To simplify the judiciary
structure and proceedings,
the trustees made the Dean
of Students the threshold for
all conduct disorders.

Upon receipt of a formal
complaint, the dean investi-
gates to determine whether
further proceedings are war-
rented. If so, the dean draws
up a formal statement of the
charge and holds an admin-
istrative conference with the
student involved.

The student charged has
the option of having his case
decided by the Dean of Stu-
dents, who would determine
the santion needed or sug-
gest counseling.

Terry Illustrates Judiciary System
By Examining Hypothetical Cases

Professor Smith on Sept. 27
reports to Will Terry, dean
of students, that Jack Harris

is guilty of plagiarism.

Professor Smith brings the

Student's paper as well as
the other documents which
indicate that the boy used
information he didnt foot-
note,
After making an investi-
gation of these documents,
the dean determines that fur-
ther proceedings are war-
rented.

He then prepares a formal
statement of the charge set-
ting forth the nature, time
and place of the violation
charged, and serves it on
the person. Included is a
note from the dean setting
forth a date, time and place

are guilty of plagiarism,”

says Terry. “This is a ser-
ious charge and I am pre-
pared to give you a maxi-
mum sanction of suspension
for one or two terms.

“Let me fell you that you
have two alternatives: you
may allow me to handle the
matter, or you may go to
the Hearing Committee,”
Terry says. “In order for me
to handle the case, though,
you must admit the charge.”

Jack Harris thinks for a
few minutes, and then says,
“I guess I’m guilty, but I
want you to handle the case.”

Terry then proceeds with
the conference. He asks
Harris to present evidence
of mitigation or extenuation
of the violation admitted.

Following the presentation
of the evidence, Terry must
make a decision whether he
should dispose of the case
through counseling or
through imposition of a

In this particular case
Terry doesn't feel counseling
appropriate so he imposes
a sanction of definite sus-

pension for the remairder

of the term.

Terry then promptly noti-
fies Harris of the decision
and then prepares a digest
of the preceedings at the ad-
ministrative conference.

Upon receipt of the dean’‘s
decision, Harris’, feels that
Terry was too hard on him.
Harris writes a written notice
to the secretary of the Re-
view Board as well as to the
Dean of Students and asks
for an appeal.

A date is set. Equipped
with the dean's digest and
a verbatim reproduction of
the entire proceedings of the
administrative conference,
the Review Board hears the
arguments of Harris.

The Review Board then
decides whether Harris is
guilty and whether the sanc-
tion is appropriate. In this
situation they uphold the
dean's findings, and notify
Harris.

Since the Review Board
upheld Harris’ suspension
for a definite period of time,

Harris has the right to ap-
peal to the president.

Upon receipt of Harris’
wish for an appeal, the pre-
sident reviews all previous
testimony and may hear
oral arguments for Harris.

The president then decides
whether the sanction is ap-
propriate. He does so and
notifies Harris that he is

college court hearing, his
case would be prosecuted by
an elected student solicitor
and decided by a student
Hearing Committee.

Composed of nine seniors,
six juniors and three sopho-
mores elected at large from
the student body, the Hear-
ing Committee has authority
to enforce one of seven sanc-
tions: warning, censure, fine,
probation, restitution, definite
suspension, indefinite sus-
pension.

Whichever option the ,stu-
dent chooses, either the dean
or the Hearing Committee,
he can appeal! their decision
to a Review Board composed
of three faculty members
and two senior students.

The Review Board would
examine the case of the
student to determine if a
judicial error had been made
or the sanction was not ap-
propriate.

It can either affirm the
previous decisions, call for
a re-hearing, dismiss the
charges or reduce (not in-
crease) the sanctions.

The student could _ ulti-
mately appeal to the college
president, but the president
would only consider the ap-
propriateness of the sanc-
tion in the total context of
the case.

Accurate records will be
kept of all proceedings, and
these records will be kept
separate from any academic
records. Where the decision
is acquittal the records
will be destroyed immediate-
lv. Where the decision is sus-
pension they will be destroy-
ed after 10 years, and for a
lesser sanction, after five
years.

The new system also pro-
vides for a codification of
college regulations by the
college president and his
staff. These regulations will
deal with general matters
such as parking and the use
of college facilities.

Answering the question as
to whether the dean can
function as a counselor and
a disciplinarian, the trustees
allow'the dean of students to
disqualify himself from any
judicial proceedings where Y

Lost Pages Cause Delay

The delay im the distri-
bution of the 1971 Quips and
Cranks was apparently
caused by the loss of some
page layouts through the
mail, according to Tim
Timmons, editor of the year-
book. ;

‘We tad sent part of the
layouts up to the American
Yearbook Company in Mary-
Jand where the yearbook is
printed, but they never re-
ceived them,” said Tim-
mons.

The yearbook will be mail-
ed directly to the student

body |from the publishers as
soon as Whe books are fin-
ished.

“We had hoped that the
company would tave been
able to compensate for the
time, but evidently they had
a very tight schedule of pub-
ications,"’ said Timmons.

“I talked to our regional
representative, but he wasn't
very encouraging about pros-
pects for an early mailing.
He just dold me that the
books would be mailed some-
time during the summer,”
Timmons; said.
