Chasing away the

winter blahs

By JOHN EARLES

Does the return to work after
an extended Christmas vaca-
tion leave you cold? Do you
reminisce about the times
when you could spend the day
relaxing outdoors and watch-
ing Bowl games? If so, January
Chill Chasers may be the solu-
tion you have been looking for.

Sponsored by the Davidson
College Union, Chill Chasers
offer a variety of short courses
to members of the Davidson
community. —

The courses range from
stress management to begin-
ning juggling and serve to
bring together different ele-
ments of the campus in an ex-
change of information and
goodwill.

Since the program began in
1982, offering only six courses,
Chill Chasers have proven in-
creasingly popular. Last year,
over 400 people took advan-
tage of at least one course, and
this year’s selection of 25
courses offers an even wider
selection.

Union Program Coordinator
Ruth Pittard believes that the
success of the project is due to

leaving people satisfied.”

Another reason for the popu-
larity of the program could be
the ever-changing variety of
courses. This year, English
Professor and Pulitzer prize
nominee Tony Abbott will lead
a discussion on the poetic proc-
ess. In addition, certified gra-
phoanalyst Nancy Otterbach, a
Davidson native, will offer a
course on handwriting analy-
sis.

While other popular courses
include discussions on self-
management, the year’s most
requested program was
Grounds Supervisor Irvin
Brawley’s instruction in the
basics of shag.

In the opinion of Amy Burk-
esmith, the coordinator of the
Visitor’s Center and the indi-
vidual in charge of recruiting
community and _ business

"members to the program, Chill

Chasers serve as “a goodwill
effort on the part of the campus
and community” tolivenup “a
time of year when things get a
little bit dull.”

If the winter blahs have been
getting you down, maybe a
