Pre-Medical Staff Initiates
Simulated Interview Plan

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Staff Writer

“Along with a good grade
point average, a good interview
is one of the most important
factors in gaining acceptance to
med school,” said Pre-med Ad-
visor James Fredericksen.

In an effort to help pre-meds
have better med school inter-
views, Fredericksen initiated
the concept of the practice in-
terview for junior pre-med ma-
jors

“We just can’t overlook some-
Ciuing that might make a differ-
ence,” he said. ‘“‘How a person
handles himself in an interview
is extremely important. It can
mutke or break between 60 and
75 peicent of the applican

actual med school session. Two
faculty members and a senior
who has already had a med
school interview form each of
the six interviewing committees.

The interviewing committee
notes each students’ perform-
ance and at a later date will
advise him of their evaluation
in an effort to help him im-
prove.

The hope is that familiarity
with the interviewing procedure
will enable the student to relax.
Adrian Lng, a senior on one of
the committees said, ‘‘Not many
do poorly cn an interview if
they are relaxed.”

Juniors who have been through
the practice sessions feel that
it should be a great help to
them.

“I'm sure that there will be
a lot less pressure on me now
when I go for my interview next

fall,” said Mike Collins, ‘‘I’'ll
have an idea of what to ex-
pect.”

Fredericksen also feels the in-
terviews are successful. ‘‘I
think the idea is working out
very well,” he said. ‘‘Experi-
ence is the important thing...
they won’t be so apprehensive
next time.” ,

Some of the questions asked
were ethical, others personal.
One student was asked his opin-
ion of abortion, and many were
asked why they wanted a career
in the medical profession and
what they planned to do if they
didn’t get into med school.

If the program is judged suc-
cessful it may be expanded,
Fredericksen indicated. Possib-
ly Davidson alumni who are
currently medical students or
practicing physicians would be
added to the interviewing teams.

“After Church”

By THOM NICHOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

The Senate met Tuesday night
and took action to get the SGA
into the business of parking
regulations and out of funding
social activities.

After long and heated debate,
the Senate approved a proposal
for transferring parking regu-
lations from the Physical Plant
office to the Senate.

The plan, still to be accepted
by the business office and pres
ident, retains most regulations
now in effect. One controversial
change is the proposed raise of
the cost of a parking permit
from $2 to $3.

Student Body President Ralph
Peeples said that he and Vice
President of the Student Body
Rob Cunningham had reserva-
tians about the raise, and indi-
cated that strong student reac-
tion could easily produce an

Professor of Philosophy George
L.. Abernathy, former chairman
of the Faculty Committee on
Graduate Fellowships, said that
Imavidsen graduates are having
to settle for less prestigious
guaduate schools. In this year’s
senior class there are very few
departmental graduate fellow-
ships.

Of the 66 students who applied
to medical school this year, 36
have been accepted. Of these 66
applying, 52 are pre-med ma-
jors, and 32 out of the 36 ac-
cepted by medical schools are
pre-med majors. Of these 10
seniors with other than a pre-
med major, three were accept-
ed to medical school. Four jun-
iors applied to medical school
and one was accepted. Addi-
tional seniors miay be accepted
by medical schools in the near
future. Chairman of the Pre-
Med Department James M.
Fredericksen has suggested to
those who are not accepted by
medical schools to apply to den-
tal schools.

The proposal was amended to
delete provisions for a new fin-
ing system which detailed spe-
cific fines and involvement of
the Dean of Students.

Peeples admitted that the
compiomised plan did not ex-
acuy “‘thaill him”, but that it
Was a ‘‘step in the right direc-
tion.” He praised the work of
the traffic committee, however.

“The SGA had to get involv-
ed in parking because the pres-

ples said.

ity funding.

Representatives to the coun-
cil will be elected from each
dorin within two weeks of the
beginning of school, and will
have sole authority for distrib-
uting SGA aud RIC social
funds.
