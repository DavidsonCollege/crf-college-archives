Dr. Davidson's Speech Warns

Against Loosing

Dr. Chalmers Davidson's speech in
chapel Tuesday morning got straight
to the point on this matter of increas-
ing the size of the Davidson student
body. A summary is on page one of
this paper.

But aside from what he said, it
is significant that he said it. Too often,
faculty members and students are
afraid to “stick their neck out” on
any important, controversial subject.

Dr. Davidson's speech was not on-
ly a boost in awakening the student
body to the advantages of a small stu-
dent body, but it was also a healthy
step toward getting the college lead-
ers to assert their personal opinion
in public for all to hear.

We have been particularly grati-
fied, moreover, at the bold way in
which Dr. Pietenpol and Mr. Martin
have made it clear that they favor
keeping Davidson at its present size—
and without any “ifs.” These two col-
lege leaders, and now Dr. Davidson.
have gone on record in favor of keep-
ing Davidson a small college in the
range of 850 students.

They are against increasing the
enrollment as a matter of principle.
Of course. if increased enrollment
must come, then let it be accompanied

Crisis In
The North

Knifings, assaults, hoodlumism,
rape, and suicide are just some of the
words that describe recent violence
in the schools of the city of New York.

Even though the facts that slip
through the “Paper Curtain” from the
north in the daily newspapers are
carefully worded, there seems no way
to cover up the ugly scars that New
York incorrigibles are making on the
city’s public school system.

Despite the fact that our local pa-
per often buries such items on the
inside pages, most southern papers, as
well as The Wall Street Journal, U. S.
News and World Report, and The
Christian Science Monitor have given
these stories the full airing that they
deserve.

People in the south will not soon
forget that onlv five months, ago crack
Army troops were flown into the capi-
tal of Arkansas to enforce at the point
of bayonets the enrollment of nine
Negro students. Today. and three mil-
lion taxpayers’ dollars later. guards
still patrol Central High School.

The core of the trouble in Little
Rock and in New York City is the
same: forced mixing of the races in
‘the public schools. But here all
similarity ends. While the problems
in the two cities are the same. the
methods used to bring peace and quiet
afe. vastly different.

Indeed. while the occupation troops
keep peace at Little Rock. violence
continues in New York. Because of
this, many southerners are confused
as to why Gotham does not receive
the same treatment as did Arkansas.
To this question, Senator Herman E.
Talmadge of Georgia said last week:
“The people of Georgia are deeply
sympathetic with the citizens of
Brooklyn... It has been suggested

by a relative increase in the student-
faculty ratio. books in the library,
endowment; and all other factors on
which colleges are judged.

But the important thing to note is
that there are important men, high in
administrative and faculty circles,
who favor no further increase in the
number of students regardless of any
increased resources.

These people, and the DAVIDSON.
IAN too, favor keeping our present
enroliment level. At the same time we
want to increase the faculty-student
ratio, the endowment, and other fa-
cilities. We favor consolidating the in-
tangible benefits. of a small liberal
arts college by seeking higher stand-
ards and increased financial support
rather than seeking more students.

Dr. Davidson's speech was a wel-
comed change from the usual plati-
tudes of chapel speeches that are de-
signed to hurt no one’s feelings.

The benefits of Davidson College
and her way of life are too valuable
to be considered lightly. The Trustees
who are responsible for the decision to
increase the enrollment should recon-
sider their action of two years ago.

Davidson has a good thing. We
hope it won't be thrown to the wind.

send federal troops to Brooklyn . .
in the same manner that he did to
force a new social order upon the
public schools of Little Rock, Ark.
The people of Georgia reject such un-
constitutional interference in purely
local affairs as a solution to any prob-
lem... "”

No doubt Senator Talmadge was
hardly surprised at seeing the tables
turned. It is still important, however,
that we note that troubles arising
from mixing is not exclusively south-
ern.

In fact, the figures will prove that
more racial violence and tension exist
in the North than in any other section.
Nevertheless, the northern press con-
tinues to throw moralistic stones at
the south. Perhaps they would better
spend their time cleaning their own
back yard.

From here, it seems as though
there is enough violence and trouble
in the nine hundred and forty-two
New York schools to keep the entire
police force busy. And if they ever
calm: down matters within the school
buildings, then there is plenty of work
for them to do on the outside where
the six hundred and forty suspended
incorrigibles stalk the streets.

An Editorial By

Samuel Johnson

In the bottle discontent seeks for
comfort. cowardice for courage and
shyness for confidence.

To this, Walter Winchell has add-
ed: ‘Likker, however, always gives
false promises. It gives neither com-
fort. nor courage and confidence. It
gives hangovers, mental deterioration
and physical disability. Therefore, if
you want a drink, take one. If you
need a drink, you're sick!”

By GRIER DAVIS

As a: war-searred veteran of
ten consecutive dance weekends,
I have been asked to make.a
few pertinent observations
about this great tradition.

Having reluctantly agreed to
do this hack work for the news-
paper, I. nevertheless, felt the
necessity of making certain sac-
rifices for the arts, however low
this particular art might be.
Therefore. | have foregone the
opportunity of dating in order
that I might treat this subject
with a greater degree of de-

; tachment.

Davidson College is located

; conveniently distant from all

points of interest. that is to say,
safely distant from all the good
things little girls are made for
—ah, I mean, made of. This
has always been a bone of con-
tention with the Davidson stu-
dent body. |

Consequently. three times a
year, the Davidson Gentleman
condescends to reveal his true
inner radiance. thus producing
a@ mass migration to the ‘center
of this gracious warmth. David-
son College. a

freshmen and for the newer mi-
grants, to point out some of
the varieties of those fine feath-
ered friends who visit our cam-
pus tri-annually.

The White-crested Kingfisher
is normally found closest to Da-
vidson. for the Queen must catch
a King. It is interesting to note
that this bird is considered par-
ticularly sacred to Southern
Presbyterian Sunday School
teachers.

The Cool Catbird is famous
for its fantastic mating dance.
and it makes its summer habitat
near the beaches. The Peacock,
though somewhat aloof from
human contact, is justifiably fa-
mous for its tail feathers.

The Ruby-breasted Goldfinch
is similarly proud of its rich
plumeage, whereby it is able
to travel Jong distances on
many such migrations. It can
be distinguished by its cry, “me.
me, me, me.” Though this bird
appears to be very distant when
in flight. it can be induced to
come down to earth.

The Large-breasted Loon is
easily identified by its protrud-
ing frontal feathers. but it is
not noted for its mentality. The
Bleary-eyed Swailow is a night
bird. existing almost entirely on

liquids, and unable physically
to face the light of day.

The Black Bat, regardless of
its characteristic blindness, is
often seen on the campus. It is
not actualiy a bird but a mam-
mal: and, although it can be
metamorphosed into a dark
horse it usually turns out to be
just a plain horse.

The Lap-winged Bluebird is so
colored because tt is unable to
fly and cannot migrate here with
the others.

The Fork-tailed Flicker is no-
torious for its unpredictable
course of flight. It may actually
be seen mating with several dif-
ferent species during the night;
and, in the day, it is usually ac-
companied by a Cuckoo.

The Morning Dove can usual-
ly be found around the golf
course in the early morning. It
prefers to build a nest of
blanket-like down, and its cry
is an indistinguishable cooing
sound.

The Horned Swift is seldom
seen except coming to and go-
ing from the campus. Its chief?
habitat is the woods. and it is
easily recognizable by its tufted
horhs which seem to vacillate
in size.

It. is my hope that this cate

LETTER TO EDITOR.

NEW EXAM SCHEDULE PROPOSED

Dear Editor:

While exams are still fresh
in our minds, I feel a criticism
of the exam schedule is in
order.

There seem to be two main
weaknesses in the system, one
—a student may have three

exams in a row which due to
conflicts can’t be changed and
too many students have two
exams on the first day of the
testing period.

FATIGUE
The first situation hinders in

YALE RECORD AWARD

Peanuts Tops Again

The Yale Record, dean of the
country’s college humor maga-
Zines. has announced that its
1958 annual award for “Humor-
ist of the Year’ will be be-
stowed on cartoonist Charles
M. Schulz. creator of the inim-
itable newspaper comic  fea-
ture “Peanuts,” which appears
(every week) in the DAVIDSON
IAN.

UNANIMOUS VOTE

Courtlandt D. B. Bryan, chair-
man of the Yale Record. said
that Mr. Schulz was selected for
the honor by a unanimous vote
of the 36 members of the com-
bined Editorial, Art and Busi-
ness Boards of the magazine.
Formal presentation of the Hu-
mor Award will be made to Mr.
Schulz at the annual Record
banquet. to be held in New
Havem, Conn., on Wednesday,
February 19.

This isn't the first honor that

his laughable “Peanuts” have
won for Charles M. Schulz. In
1956, the National Cartoonist
Society named him “Cartoonist
of the Year.” Last September.
original drawings of the news-
paper cartoons were the sub-
ject of a “one-man” art exhibit
at the Rhode Island School. of
Design. in Providence, R. I.. and
similar exhibitions have since
been held in Pittsburgh, Pa..
Des Moines, Iowa. and other
cities. .
CONGRATULATIONS

We extend congratulations,
not only to. Mr. Schulz for this
latest recognition of his work,
but also to the editors of the
Yale Record, for the excellence
of: their judgement. And we
can't help wondering what good
ol’ Charlie Brown and _ little
Linus would say if they knew
they'd been rated tops by such
discriminating judges as real
college men!

preparation, and also causes fa-
tigue which inhibits the mind
from functioning clearly. Also,
there is a definite pressure ele-
ment.

A student with the above situ-
ation is ailowed to put his mid-
dle one off until spring holi-
days, but this seems unsatis-
factory since the first semester
material is then no longer fa-
miliar. and since it also entails
the professor’s making out a
new exam,

FREE PERIOD

I suggest. therefore, that a
student be allowed to take his
middle exam during a free per-
iod during exam week at a time
approved by the professor.

The second situation is un-
derstandable since. with last
minute reviews, term papers.
and so forth, students, par-
ticularly freshmen, cannot ade-
quately prepare for two exams
on the first day. Since there are
free periods during the exam
week, it seems as if, only one
exam should be scheduled on
the first day.

FEWER DAYS?

There has been talk of con-
densing the present exam per-
iod into a fewer number of days.
I feel. however that the eight
day period is necessary for the
students to do their best work,
providing the above changes are
made...

logue may be of some help,
especially to the neophyte Da-
vidson Gentleman who has not
yet. mastered the art of exuding
this radiant wit, charm. and
grace.

In closing. I might add a few

words of advice for him. Just
remember first of all that one
may catch these birds only by
the correct application of the
well-known salt; and lastly, bare
in mind that a bird in the bush
is worth twe on the dance floor.

[ON CAMPUS

By CHARLES HELMS

Re. Tuesday’s chapel talk: Dr. Chalmers Davidson
was very kind to us in his remarks about enrollment,
(spiritual awareness, good manner, etc. of D.C. students).
When questioned later, he admitted that as a matter of
fact it was a case of having good manners individually
and terrible manners collectively (this is probably still
charitable, but certainly somewhat more realistic). Per-
haps some of our chapel speakers would agree with this
latter. Who can ever forget the freshman holding a news-
paper in front of his face and rattling it noisily?

The witty professor quoted some Scripture concern-
ing his talk in chapel: “If there be any virtue, if there
be any praise in them, think on these things.”—and
further suggested that we not stop at thinking but that
furthermore we let the trustees know how the. student
body feels. Dr. Davidson, simply expressed “what oft
was thought, but ne'r so well expressed.”

The progressive nature of our sister educational in;
stitution (?) is amazing; the administration has forbidden
the students to see the performance of “Damn Yankees”

in Charlotte.

Charley Lampley ran right smack into this mid-Vic-
torian wet blanket recently. On the night that he pinned
his girl (Piggy) at Queans, she came in 2 minutes late.
This resulted in her being campused over the February
14-16 weekend (which everyone knows is Mid-Winters at
Davidson.) But scrappy little Charley didn’t take this ly-
ing down; he organized a petition with over 250 names on
it including such notables as Ross Smyth, John Trask,
Coach Parker and Mrs. Moore. Good luck. Charley.

In the Homecoming issue of the DAVIDSONIAN,
Bob Lathan wrote satirically of dance weekends; an ex-
tremely blase. anonymous senior expressed a highly cyni-
cal view of the troublesome affairs; and the gist of Bob
Jones’ column was that “women are no damn gand” Oh.
viously our lack of sophistication is showing, but we look
forward to dance weekend. we like girls, and we have

a good date for Mid-Winters.

Student, Faculty
Creativity Urged

By JOHN BERNHARDT

To paraphrase Mark Twain's
comment on his old man, “When
I was a sophomore, I thought
the school didn’t know what it
was doing, but now that I'm a
senior, I'm amazed at how much
it’s learned in two years.” In
fact. I'm amazed at what it’s
learned in one month, for since
my last article ("Mired in the
Past"), everyone of my specific
illustrations has been corrected
or shown to be mistaken. That
is excellent, for the willingness
of a school to change to meet
the needs of the students is
something of a measure of its
alertness and quality.

“SO LITTLE”

This. still leaves the general
problem, however. unsettled.
Why does so little thought fre-
quently go into the four years

of education a student mects”

here? How can he be “edu-
cated” in a subject if he isn't
acquainted with what people
are thinking about that sub-
ject today?

Furthering knowledge is not
usually the aim of the student,
but it should certainly be the
aim of the educator. The only
way to further it as well as
merely passing it on is investi-
gation and research, and in the
process of active investigation
both the professor and, eventu-
ally. his students become more
interested in their subject.
Creativity and original ‘investi-
gation make for sharper think-
ing.

FACULTY RESEARCH

Also. schools are judged, in
academic circles at least, by the
work they turn out as well as
the graduates. and books and
papers published by the facul-
ty show this original work. Re-
search by the faculty is neces-
sary for a full education.

Not being an _ irredeemable
utopian, I will add that condi-

tions here are not. the best for
tesearch. Professors are work-
ing hard as it is, and we stu-
dents aren't doing much to en-
courage their interest. The stu-
dent; faculty ratio is 10:1, which
the trustees should consider be-
fore demanding further in-
creases in enrollment. Although
the figure is not at the danger
point, it is certainly high enough
to setiously damage both the
calibre and the quality of teach-
ing and research.
GRANTS

The toad might be eased by
having large lecture classes for
subjects which are mainly lec-
ture, with breakdown into small |
discussion groups to provide
needed explanations and discus-
sions. Perhaps student help
might be enlisted in checking
Papers, with the professor giv-
ing the grades. Research grants
for the school or the individual
professor shduld be sought out
and encouraged, with shifts in
the teaching load to assist. If
the school has any surplus alt-
er building. it might sponsor
some investigation itself.

For students,. the, emphasis
might be shifted from memoriz-
ing facts and theories from notes
for the sake of na grade. to be:
ing curious and looking up the
answers. As long as investiga-
tion is a goal of education, and
as long as students will work
only for a grade, more empha-
sis might be placed on extra
work in the library for extra
credit. Extra credit for extra
work should. be both fair and
stimulating.

ORIGINAL THINKING

Another technique is the use

of “thought questions” on all
tests. The questions requiring
original thinking should not be
graded too heavily, for the sake
of those who depend on mem-
orizing, but they should gradual-
ly make the students think as
well ss memorize, if they are to
be educated.
_ With an increased emphasis
on creativity, originality, and in-
vestigation, clear thinking and
active interest should improve
the standard of the school. The
work need not be harder, but
through this change in empha-
sis the understanding and the
interest should actually de
crease the amount of drudgery
for the students.
