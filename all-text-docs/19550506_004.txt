R.O.T.C. Field Day Held;
Co.F Tops Competition

Spirit ran high on the drill field ‘Tuesday as the ROTC
Corps staged its first annual Military Field Day.

Company F, commanded by Cadet Capt.‘Lambe, swept to
the overall laurels with a total of 34 points, taking firsts in
three events. Company. D, under Cadet Capt. Davis followed
with 26 points, and Company A, led by Cadet Capt. Averyt,

was third with 24 points.

The inter-company competition
featured both individual and group
events, which ranged from a tug-
of-war and relay races to grenade
throws and command voice com-
petition. ]

Planned and directed by the
cadets themselves, the events pro-
ceeded with a minimum of con-
fusion, and a noticeable quantity
of company esprit de corps. Cadet
officers presided as judges over
all events.

In figuring the final results, a
tirst place counted 5 points, while
a second was good for 3 points,
and a third for 1 point.

pany A, 2) Company B, 3) tie be-

President Anderson, who
promised in his campaign speech

‘to eliminate as much as possible

of the secrecy surrounding Student
Council meetings, has announced
that he plans to hold regularly an-
nounced meetings every two wecks
starting next fall. They will be
open to all students.

A Davidsonian reporter wi!) also
be present at all meetings to write
up the activities of the Council
for publication. Although Student
Council trials will still be closed
to the student body, as much in
formation as can possibly be re.
leased, will be published.

According to Anderson, the over-
whelming majority of votes in
favor of the recent student peti-
tion to continue subsidized ath-
letics indicates that the Student
Council should back such a pro.
gram. The Council will attempt to
maintain not only the present
policy, but increase the publicity
and promotion of the Davidson
sports program, he said.

The first meeting of the new
Student Council will be held on
May 11, Wednesday evening at
seven o'clock, in the Blue Room

ATIENTION !

It has been part of the gentle-
man’s code of living here on cam-
pus that no implements are to be
taken out of fhe Union. Since last
November, however, 55 stainless
steel holders (for drinking cups)
have been I@st and numerous cof-
fee cups and silverware have
periodically disappeared. In keep
ing with the traditional gentle-
man’s agreement, it is hoped by
the Union staff that such losses,
usually caused through careless-
ness, will be minimized in the fu-
ture.
