Battalion Drill Hour
Changed to Afternoon

Daylight Saving Causes Return to
Old Regime.

Beginning Tuesday, April 2. drill was
held in the afternoon instead of in the
morning as was the custom for the past
month. This change was made neces-
sary by the Daylight Saving Bill which
went into effect at 2 o'clock Sunday
morning. The first call each afternoon
is sounded at §:10 p. m.; assembly at
5:15; recail will be sounded at 6:15.
All those going out for baseball will be
excused from drill during the baseball
season. A list of these names will be
posted later. “The supper hour has also
been changed from 5:30 to 6:30 on
Sundays, and from 6:30 to 7:00 during
the week.

SMENTS ON
CAMPUS ABOUT GYM

IMPROVE

While the subtle powers of nature are
fitting the campus with the gay green coat
of spring and other vesture appropriate
for the. season, that part of the college
ground which heretofore has been a sort
of a back yard is being beautified so as

_ to correspond with and be a real part of |:

the campus. The ground is now being
leveled and walks are being made. The
matter of trees. and shrubbery will be
decided on later. ‘Fhe need of such im-
provements was apparent as soon as the
new gymnasium was finished, and plans
were made to improve the grounds to
suit the building. “The Senior class gift
which will be placed on these grounds
will also add to their attractiveness.
The gift is to be a flight of concrete
steps descending from the terrace be-
tween Chambers building and the new
gymnasium, on each side of which there
will be an electric light standard similar
to those on the library steps but some-
what larger. When all these improve-
ments are made this hitherto uninviting
region will be one of the most attractive
parts of the campus.

JOINT MEETING HELD ON
LAST SUNDAY EVENING

The regular monthly joint meeting of
the Christian Endeavor, Ministerial and
Volunteer Bands was held in Shearer
Hall at 7:20 o'clock last Sunday night.
J. W. Clark led in the discussion of the
subject, “Lessons from the Risen
Christ’s Forty Days.” He began with
a warning to the church against any for-
mal celebration of Easter. He said that
we should celebrate Easter every Sun-
day. TMs weekly celebration is im-
portant because the surety of the resur-
rection of Christ is the basis of Chris-
tianity and constitutes the most funda-
mental difference between Christianity
and other religions. The resurrection of
Christ put the capstone on the plan of
salvation and places Christianity upon
the basis of faith. A lack of response
on the part of the members was notice-
able.

Next Sunday is Consecration Sunday,
and the subject is, “The Christian Duty
and Privilege of Bible Reading.”

Concert Company.

The fifth and last entertainment pro-
moted by the Piedmont Lyceum Associa-
tion took place last Saturday night. “Phe
Fridericks Concert Company will be re-
membered with pleasure by all those who
attended this number, Even those who
were feeling blue, because they were
not spending Easter at home (and their
name was legion) were cheered up by
the performance.  ‘“Vhey forgot about
“Her” new hat, which they would not
see, not to mention their new suit, which
“She” would aot sec, from the moment
the performers appeared.

Mr. Aage Mridericks, a masterful vie
linist, who has toured Denmark, Bel
gium, Austria, France, Russia and Eng
land, held the audience spellbound as he
The rough-necks were hypno
tized by his wizardry and those who
know and appreciate music were fasci-
nated by his perfect artistry.

Miss Spence's representation, given
in costume, of an ladian Song Cycle,
wis enjoved by all. It carried a mes
sane and eharm all its own. She sang,

Far Off 1 Hear the Lover's Flute,”
“The Land of the Sky-blue Water.”
“The Lover's Flute Call” and ‘Phe
Moon Falls Low.” ‘hese were greatly
enjoved by the audience as was proves
by the continued applause. Appearing
second time she sang, “Phe Open Se-
eret.’ “Phe Little Trish Girl.” and
“Love's Old Sweet Song.” “These also
caused the college ‘boys to send up an
applause that made old Shearer Hall
tremble.

Miss Ake, the accompanist, played
“Rondo Capriccioso,” which was greatly
enjoyed. Her work at the piano, from
beginning to end, was a success.

Mr. Powell Hale, a perfect tmper
sonator of old women and young boys.
can not be too highly praised for his de
lightful performance. Among the selec-
tions piven were, “The Pessimistic Aunt
Nappy.” “If You Were a Dog Lake
fim.” and “The ‘Tramp's Story of Ua-
written History.”

‘This closes our Lyceum — entertain-
ments for this scholastic year. Let's give
15 Rahs for our managers, Williamson
and McDonald, for their good work for
us this year.

Dr. J. B. Woods Talks
At Y. M. C. A. Meeting

Calis Attention to General Meaning
of Word “Sport.”

The last meeting under the direction
of the retiring Y. M. C. A. cabinet was
held last “Phursday. evening. « Dr. J. .B.
Woods, who has been a medical mis-
sionary to Tsing-Kiang-Pu, China, since
1894, made an interesting talk on the
subject, “Reing a Sport for Christ.”
Opening his talk by calling attention
to the general meaning of the word
“sport.” Dr. Woods called special at-
tention to the meaning of the word in
the popular sense such as is fotind in the
athletic world. He said a sport played
the game according to the rules and put
his heart into it. He emphasized the
fact that there was a need for every
Christian to be a better Christian and
for us all to be “sports” for Christ.
The retiring president, J. LL. Fowle,
introduced the newly elected president,
IG. Lilly, to the association, and after
speaking a few words of encouragement
and wishing the incoming officers suc-
cess, he closed the meeting, with prayer.
Che old and new cabinets met inmedi-
ately-after the meeting was dismissed.
