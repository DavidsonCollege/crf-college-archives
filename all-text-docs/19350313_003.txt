THE DAVIDSONIAN,

MARCH 13, 1935

EDITION OFFERS
JUNIOR HISTORY

Members Of Third Year Class
Prominent In Many Phases
Of Activity

“Every dog has his day!” And_ this
edition of the Davidsonian is dedicated
to that honorable portion of the student
body known as the juniors.

Early in the annals of Davidson Col-
lege history the junior class celebrated
this dedication by Junior Speaking. And
now this form of assertion has been
transformed into the dance set retain-
ing the name held in former days when
the three-year men orated before friends,
families and sweethearts.

On September 12, nineteen hundred
and thirty-three, one hundred and nine-
ty-eight promising greenhorns strolled
through the portals of Chambers Build-
iftg to register as members of the class
of '36. The class historian stated, “The
first year consisted of heavy laundries
and numerous errands.” But these hum-
ble duties were soon replaced by deserv-
ing dignity.

With approximately three-fourths of
its journey complete, we pause briefly
to glimpse into achievement of its life
of yesteryear.

First, a brief glance makes manifest
the eminent position of the juniors in
athletics, scholarship and extra-curric-
ular activities. View our prided grid-
iron, diamond, tennis, mat, cinder path
and basketball teams; many three-year
men fill important positions.

This writing must speak for the class
as a whole for individual honors are
numberless. But as the year wanes,
there are. men who stand out for one
reason or another, be it on the honor
roll, on the athletic team, or in some
other phrase of worthy endeavor. Jun-
iors point with pride at the pre-eminence
of their classmates in gridiron compe-
tition. For their fellow students form
the nucleus of. our future football team
with Henry Cathey and Cole Windham
acting as co-captains. “Woody” Burns,
Six Johnston, John Lee, Paul Pittman,
Midge Verble, Baxter Yarborough and
others represent next year’s
hope.

Jack Jenkins, junior twirler, will fea-
ture the pitching performance for the
baseball team. “Woody” Burns, base-
ball letterman, will probably hold down
his position at first base. Arthur Haake,
“Hank” Loftin, John Partridge, and
Don Stewart will try for places vacated
hy last year’s seniors.

Martin Barnett and Carlyle Lewis, of
last year’s tennis team, will probably
play again this year. George Hornbeck,
transfer from State, is expected to cap-
ture a place on the squad.

Rhodes Elections’
Schedule Changed

Word has been received here that an
important change has been made in the
date of appointment of Rhodes Scholars.
Instead of in early January, the elec-
tions will take place December 12th or
14th in the individual states, and the
district meetings will be held December
16th, 1935.

This means that all applications must
be in the hands of state secretaries No-
vember 2nd, and that Davidson candi-
dates must be named by the faculty
about the middle of October, consider-
ably earlier than during recent years.
For this reason seniors and juniors who
are interested in the scholarships should
make their plans early. ree

Many misconceptions regarding the
scholarships are prevalent among stu-
dents. Students interested are urged to
confer with members of the faculty com-
mittee on the Rhodes Scholarships, and
to read Oxford of Today, by Crosby and
Aydelotte.

Warner DuBose, Albert Stutts,
And Harold Sugg Witness
Weird Accident
By H. G. Succ

Of the 50,000 spectators that lined the
glistening sands of Daytona Beach to
watch Sir Malcolm Campbell and_ his
Bluebird in a play with speed and death
were three lucky Davidson students who
stopped over on a debating trip to watch
the try for a 300 mph run.

Unbeknown Warner DuBose, Al-
bert Stutts and Harold Sugg at the time,
Campbell grappled with death in the
cockpit of the mighty Bluebird during
the weirdest accident of his- 30 years’
driving career. Gathering speed for the
test mile in the middle of the 1114-mile
course, Sir Malcolm had 233
mph, his foot to the floor.
