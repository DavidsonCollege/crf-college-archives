Carlton Pritchard retires

Richard Terry to take over Auxilliary Services

By Jennifer Kerns

Director of Auxilliary Ser-
vices Carlton Pritchard will retire
on April 1. Richard Terry, current
Director of Residence Life, will
assume Pritchard’s position.

Pritchard supervises the man-
agement of dining services, the
bookstore, the laundry, and the
Campus Network multi-purpose
card. “This card compares with
the cards of other big universities
as an all-campus card,” he says.
Fourteen years ago, Pritchard
served as the first manager of Vail
Commons.

Terry understands the impor-
tance of creating budgets and long-
term plans, but emphasizes his
desire to continue working with
students. “I realize that as Director
of Auxiliary Services, there will be
less intense student involvement;
however, I intend to provide stu-
dent services and development.”
During the next three months, Terry
plans to meet weekly with Pritchard
to familiarize himself with the job.

As Vice President of Student
Life, Dean Tom Shandley will head
the search for a new Residence
Life Director. Although Shandley

will make the ultimate decision,
students will likely serve as mem-
bers of the search committee. The
school will place ads in the
Chronicle of Higher Education,
hold conferences, and scout job
centers. Kurt Holmes will act as
RLO Director until the new direc-
tor takes over in June

Terry says, “It will be very
easy to fill this job. Because of our
Honor Code, there are fewer disci-
plinary measures than at other col-
leges. Also, we have a healthy
budget and a commitment to high
standards.”

The sale of cigarettes on campus?

Gullan writes proposal to have smokes sold in Cafe again

By Jay Jennings

Cigarettes have not been sold
on campus for five years, but a
resolution being brought to the
SGA next week will attempt to
change this. Some students recog-
nize the irony of the timing, after
the ban on smoking in school build-
ings has just been passed.

The proposal will attempt to
get cigarettes either sold at the
Union Cafe, the Outpost, or in a
vending machine in basement
Chambers. .

This would provide a conve-
nience for student smokers, al-
though they still could not smoke
in school buildings. :

PiKA Senator Bill Gullan,
who wrote the proposal, pointed
out that students often need ciga-

rettes on the weekends after con-
suming alcohol. A cigarette ma-
chine would prevent students from
driving tonearby stores late at night
while under the influence.

Freshman Senator Demian
Dellinger called the resolution “ri-
diculous,” saying that students
should buy their cigarettes before
they start drinking.

Thad Reece, aself-proclaimed
anti-smoker, says, “I can’t see how
smoking machines will effect the
amount of contact I have with
smoke. It simply would be a con-
venience to people I know. Thus,
I cannot see any reason to object to
the resolution.”

Matt Rone took a different
tone when asked about his response
to the proposed resolution. He

says, “It seems kind of pointless to
discuss such an issue considering
the recent efforts to ban smoking
in certain areas on campus. Why
sell cigarettes in a building you
cannot smoke in? I’1l continue to
go to Dover’s.”

Cigarettes were removed from
the Union Cafe five years ago.
There were two main reasons: the
price of the cigarettes was not com-
petitive with competing sellers, and
students and parents were against
the sale of cigarettes on campus.

The SGA tabled the proposal
for one week to allow some changes
in the language of the resolution.
This also gives time for students to
express their opinions to their SGA
representatives before the Tues-
day SGA meeting.

Grades sent out quickly:
blame postal service for delay

By Amy Whitmire

The Registrar’ s Office utilized
a new software program last se-
mester which sent students their
grades faster than ever before. This
new software scans grades instead
of forcing them to be entered into a
computer by hand.

Last semester, even after a
glitch in the program occurred, the
Registrar’ s Office was able to mail
students’ grades four working days
after professors turned in the stu-
dents’ final averages.

In the future, they will at-
tempt to mail grades to students
three days after the faculty turn
them in. The old process took 10
days.

Registrar Polly Griffin says,
“We were pleased to be able to
mail grades so much sooner than
ever before. Grading and grade
processing are complex functions
which our new technology has
improved dramatically. One of the
results is quicker turnaround time
in grades.”

Because students take their last
exams so close to Christmas, the
holiday season interferes with
exam grading. Self-scheduled
exams delay grading since students
take the tests in a staggered fash-
ion. .
The Registrar’s Office is re-

quired to give Davidson faculty no
less than five days to grade exams
and turn in students’ final aver-
ages.

The faculty’s five days begin
the day after the last exam period,
but the grading period was inter-

rupted by Christmas and New
Year’s holidays for the faculty.
Professors delivered final grades
to the Registrar’s Office on Janu-
ary 3, the fifth day that college
employees worked following ex-
ams.

New PC officers elected

By Patricia Evans

New Patterson Court Council
President Steven Shames looks
forward to a productive and event-
ful year.

Shames, Treasurer of Phi
Delta Theta, will work with
chancelor-elect and Warner Hall
President Elizabeth Anderson to
review current problems on
Patterson Court in 1995.

Connor President Jill Dyer
now serves as Sergeant-at-Arms.
She will head the judiciary and
judicial board review committees.
Junior Brian Cole, President of Phi

_ Delta Theta, is now treasurer of the

council.

Presdident of Kappa Sigma
Burt Arrington will chair the
newly-formed rules committee

which will review the rules and
laws of the court.

Shames says that the new
council has “a huge agenda. It is
going to be a big year. I don’t feel
that the PCC has tradtitionally been
an influential body on campus, and
it represents [a majority] of stu-
dents. We hope to re-vamp some
of the by-laws, form a broader
membership of the council, and
create more committees.”

Former President Josh
Worsham feels confident that the
new council will serve the Patterson
Court community well. “It looks
like one of the most energetic
groups that we have ever had.”

“Tt’s going to be a big year,”
says Shames. “I think that we will
