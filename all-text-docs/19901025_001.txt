Poet Sanchez Evokes. Emotion —

By KIERNAN SLATER

A standing ovation completed
’ the eleventh hour presentation on
Thursday, Oct. 18. This enthusias-
tic response was directed towards
Sonia Sanchez in praise of her
dramatic poetry reading and shar-
ing of her personal philosophy.

Sanchez’s wide-spreadappeal

excludes her from the limiting title
of Afro-American feminist poet.
She supports the equality and
mutual respect among people.
Assistant Chaplain Brenda Tapia
said, “I was touched by the univer-
sality and even more the spiritual-
ity [of Sanchez.”

' Following the eleventh hour
_ presentation, Sanchez attended a

' luncheon at the Black Student —

Coalition house. The BSC hon-
ored' Sanchez with a key-shaped
plaque symbolizing her continu-
ing welcome tothe BSC house and
DavidsonCollege,
‘The students gathered after
lunch for an informal talk with
Sanchez during which, according

to BSC president Lindsey Mills,
“many emotions were expressed.”
Mills found Sanchez to be a “di-
versified poet, expressing an op-
pressed, African-American and
feminist point-of-view.”
‘Sanchez concluded her day in
Dr. David Long’s southern litera-
ture class. She discussed with the
students many of the works they
have read this semester, specifi-

“cally Zora Nealle Hurston’s, Their
Eyeswere Watching God. Dr. Long.
found Sanchez very effective say-
ing, “She found a perspective,
especially on racism, thatIcouldn’t
stress ina class studying the juxta-
position of black and white litera-
ture.”

Week Focuses on
Alcohol at Davidson

By JENNY SCARBOROUGH

Davidson took part in its first
Alcohol Awarcness Weck in a
variety of ways, including non-
alcoholic court parties, Icctures,
films and pledges from students
and staff to avoid consuming alco-
hol for a weck.

The activities were coordinated
by the Chaplain’s Committce and
the Residence Life Office, who
said the goal for the weck was not

to make judgements concerning
alcohol consumption on campus,
but to promote responsible deci-
sion making with alcohol. Dircc-
torof Residence Life Richard Terry
said Davidson’s decision to have
an awareness weck coincides with
the discussion surrounding the ncw
Patterson Court alcohol policy.
Activitics this Friday include
Jazz Band “Dry” in the 900 Room,

Collins Plans for
Court Renovations

By CHRIS HOVELAND and
WALTER PRICE

Besides the usual excitement
on Patterson Court, the anticipa-
tion ofhousc renovations has stirred
‘up members of the eating houses
and fraternities. On October 15,
Physical Plant Superintendent Bob
Collins met with house representa-
tives to discuss plans for housc res-
torations.

Thecollege agreed tothe house
renovationson the advise of Collins
who told The Davidsonian that the

-college should either “fix ‘em up

or shut ‘em down.” The condition
of the houses has deteriorated over
the last fifteen years due to the lack
of maintenance and the inability of
the houses themselves to meet the
changing needs of their members.

The financing for this project
is provided by the Student Life
Reserve Account. Although the
condition of each house will affect
theamountof funding, Collins has
allotted “in the neighborhood of

$35-40,000 per house.” In addi:

tion, houses will be expected to use

their own funds for extra altera-

tions.

A student committee was
formed by Collins to determine the
needs of the houses, The commit-
tee and Collins worked together to
lay out a general floor plan which

o

included changes in apartment and

Storage space. The plans for reno-
vations for all houses include attic
fans, fluorescent lighting, power
outlets for bands, additional cn-
trances from porches and basc-
