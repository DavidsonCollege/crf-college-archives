Tonight at theArmory-Auditorium
in Charlotte, Rubinoff, famous
maestro of the violin, and Fray and
Braggiotti, piano duo, are being pre-
sented in concert by the Junior
Chamber of Commerce of that city.

For the past few years Rubinoff
has been a favorite on radio pro-
grams. He first came into promi-
nence by his appearance with his
orchestra on Eddie’ Cantor's pro-
gram. Since that time he has kept
his orchestra intact, until recently
he began a road tour with Fray and
Braggiotti which will carry him ov-
er the entire eastern and central
part of the United States. Rubinoff

The program for tonight is des- |
ignated as “a concert presentation

of modern music.” Rubinoff will

present such popular favorites as

Kreisler’s ‘Old Refrain” in addition

ettas and also various
numbers. One novelty for which
this duo has become famous is the
taking of a simple melody, such as
“Yankee Doodle,” and interpreting
it in the manner of Bach, Chopin,
Handel, and other music masters.
