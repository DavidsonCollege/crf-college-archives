Cat sailors grab conference fourth

The Davidson College Sail-
ing team recently whisked
through three regattas in,a
week, including two held over
1000 miles apart on the same
day, to close out what Team
Captain Dave Francis called
the most successful sailing
season in three years.

Saturday, April 17 wit-
nessed the Wildcats sailing in
both the Southern Atlantic
Intercollegiate Sailing Asso-
ciation (SAISA) Champion-
ship Regatta at Charleston
Harbor, South Carolina and in
an intersectional regatta at
Ohio State.

Davidson finished fourth
among the 14 SAISA confer-
ence schools, with only the top
six teams actually sailing at
Charleston. The University of
South Carolina won the
conference, followed by the
College of Charleston, the
Citadel, Davidson, Old
Dominion, and the University
of Virginia.

Francis, with Laurie
Bingaman as crew, skippered
the A-boat while Chuck
Barrineau and crew Tommy
Lee sailed the B-boat.

Francis said the unfamiliar
boats and strong tides
prevented a better showing for
the Wildcats, but added tha
the fourth spot finish com-
prised Davidson’s strongest
finish since a 1973 third place.

“We beat all the schools in
our division of the confer-
ence,’’ said Francis. ‘‘All the
Northern Division schools
(Davidson, Old Dominion, and
Virginia) got hurt by the
strong tides in Charleston
Harbor--we’re just not used to
sailing against tides. Citadel,
College of Charleston, and
South Carolina sail against
tides all the time. They were
used to them and did not get
hurt like we did,’’ said Fran-
cis.

Francis said that the tides
presented problems mainly in
timing, particularly in timing

the start of a race so as not to
cross the starting line prior to
the beginning of the race.

At the Ohio State Intersec-
tional Regatta held the same
day, A-skipper Stuart Camp-
bell, with Dave Love as crew,
and B-skipper Greg Eason,
with crew Alice White, sailed
30 races during the two-day
regatta, finishing 13th out of
the 15 teams in attendance.

Francis commented on the
low finish. ‘‘Intersectional
regattas attract teams from all
over the country. The compe-
tition is tough.

“Also you have to remem-
ber that the two skippers at
Ohio were our third and fourth
skippers--the other two were
at the conference regatta.

“But the regatta was
valuable. We gained a lot of
experience and we learned a
lot,’”’ said Francis.

Returning home the next
Sunday, the sailors picked up
an easy victory at the Annual
Team Race with the Lake
Norman Yacht Club.

In team racing, three boats
per team sail in a best of seven
race contest. The finish of all
three boats is important, with
the team totaling the lowest
from all three boat’s final
places winning that race.

Dave Francis skippered and
Eleanora Collins crewed
Davidson’s first boat; Greg
Eason and Alice White sailed
the second, followed by Stuart
Campbell and Dave Love in
the third.

“We wrapped it up in four
races,’’ said Francis. ‘‘We
were more used to the boats
and the strong wind worked to
our advantage. We did not
have to work too hard to beat
them.”

Francis and Collins finished
first in all four races, including
three ‘‘horizon jobs’’. The
term ‘‘horizon job’’ comes
from ocean sailing, wherein
the lead boat finishes ‘Over

winelonett i,

their best season in years.

the horizon’’ ahead of the
second boat.

Francis expressed pleasure
with the improvement of the
team over the last two years.

‘‘The last two years have

been rebuilding years. At the _

beginning of the 1974 season,
I was the only real sailor on
the team. We had lost a lot of
seniors the spring before and
had to start from scratch.

“Chuck, Greg, and Stuart
had not had any real racing
experience previously. Now,
we are all sailing consistently
better.

ROUND THE HORN. Sailors have more fun, especially during

“T am the only person in the
top eight on the team who will
graduate this year. We will
have more depth and experi-

ence next year than we had
this year. We'll be competitive
next year,’’ concluded
Francis.
