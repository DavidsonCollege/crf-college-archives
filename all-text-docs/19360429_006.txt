To the Christian Students of David-
son College:

When the Great Conimander 4s
ready to give you your orders, He
will not stand in person: beside your
table saying, “Follow Me,” as He did
to Matthew. Nor will He strike you
down with a great light, like Paul.
Rather, He will use the surrounding
circumstances and your common sense
—perhaps, a reminder like this.

Do you see a great malady threat-
ening all human kind, waging war on
society and on the souls of men? Mal-
adies cry for remedies—likewise for
treatment. This depression, which is
primarily spiritual, can be cured by
one remedy only, the Gospel of Jesus
Christ. Maladies and remedies placed
side by side do not offset each other.
Remedies must be applied by a person.

History tells us that

when Christopher Columbus’ sailors

took tobacco back home with them

everybody hailed it as one of the first

new pleasures in years.

Today tobacco gives more pleasure

to more people than ever before.

Many different claims are made for

tobacco, but most everybody agrees

on this...

Smoking is a pleasure and the

cigarette is the mildest and purest

form in which that pleasure can

be enjoyed,
