That Evenin’ Sun Go Down fit“

COACH DOLE is hungry for a victory here tomorrow. |’ ee all
His Wildcats have lost 11 of their last 13 games. This
would be an excellent time to snap out of it. Homecom-
ing, somehow, always means a little bit. more to the
players. ce

AS FAR as we're concerned the Richmond game must |
be won. If Davidson loses—whether or not the boys play’
a “good” game but are victims of a bad break—we don’t
think they’ll win another one this season. Shades of 1959!
If we win, and there’s an even chance we will, the three
remaining games hold new meaning. VPI is beyond. 4
reach, but Furman and Lehigh are not.

Tapping The Signals

HAVE YOU ever wondered what Kent Tucker is |
shouting when he calls the signals? The sound is di-DA-
dit and it-means Roger in Morse Code. Accent is on the
secoad syllable. Coach Dole has used it for seven years.
By varying the speed of the signal, our quarterback can
produce an offbeat rhythm, giving the Wildcat line an

against Carson-Newman last

Saturday as the ‘Cats rolled up
a 4-0 victory.

As a freshman and sopho-
more, Laughlin lettered as a
wing on the Davidson teams,
but last year Coach Marrotte
shifted Laughlin to center-
forward to utilize his remark-
able scoring abilities.

As a junior !ast year Mike
gained a position on the All-
South All-Star squad at center

Says Coach  Marrotte,
“Laughlin is about the fast-
est man on the squad and is
certainly one of the best drib-
blers we have ever had here
at Davidson. His ball hand-
ling is something near phe-
nomenal.”

The school scoring record in
soccer was established in 1958
by a student, Wiecher Bergsma,
from the Netherlands, who
scored eight field goals and
nine penalty kicks in eleven
games.

Clearing the hurdles with research

At Gen Tel, we've made a running start toward solving
many of tomorrow's communications problems.

For instance, scientists at General Telephone & Elec-
tronics Laboratories are working in the uncharted area
of the spectrum where radio waves take on the character-
istics of light. They have atready developed an experi-

system that may one day make

possible the transmission of tao million messages on

2 single tadio beam in free space.

As @ mejor communications company with world-wide
connections, Genera! Telephone is helping to advance
the science of tots! communications around the globe.
Our stepped-up research in the basic sciences is but
one example of the way General Telephone & Electronics
Combines the talents of many people and the facilities
of many companies to meet the future communications
needs not only of America, but the whole wortd.
