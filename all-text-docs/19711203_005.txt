Pressures Stifle
Joy Of Learning

~ Returning to Davidson after a
vacation always brings to mind
the same question: Are we real-
ly beginning a new term here
or are we merely continuing an
exercise in futility?

Futility or hopef®ssness or
uselessness. These all seem to
be strange words to apply to an

educational community. Educe-

tion should contain the elements
of joy and excitement. How
many students were really anxi-
ous for the term to start? I
doubt the number would be
more than a few.

Academic pressure causes
changes in how one deals with
the world. People become an-
happy and tend to try and hide
from anything that would bring
a little relaxation. ‘‘It must get
done” is the only thing that
matters. Relationships with
friends become strained. Most
everyone is anxious to get away,
and very few are anxious to re-
turn.

If Davidson is supposedly an
educational community, then the
word community must add some
extra meaning, something more
than just the pursuit of aca-
demic matters. It must mean a
closeness of the individuals in
that community and a sharing
of one’s self with others. It must
be a closeness brought about by
an understanding and a respect
for the humanness in all! of us.

The problem is that people
do not care about each other.
All they care about is grades or
their papers or their tests or
some other sterile academic
exercise. The difference be-
tween an academic exercise and
an educational exercise is that
the latter involves a sharing
with other individuals.

Sharing involves much more

Thornton Rebuts Patterson’s Historicity

To The Editor:

So interesting is a letter from
Prof. E. F. Patterson to the
Charlotte Observer, published
Nov. llth, and entitled “CHECK
TAIWAN'S PAST” that I am
submitting a copy of it, in case
the Davidsonian would care to
air two differing viewpoints
about Formosa.

If lack of space prevents this,
I will send a Xerox copy to
anyone requesting it.

By checking the World Book
Encyclopedia which is brief and
to the point, and also the Ency-
clopedia Brittanica 1957 edition,
1 find a notable number of er-
rors in Dr. Patterson’s historic
run-down.

He states ‘“‘but in 1947 they
rebelled against the pillage,
rape and murder of the inhabit-
ants by the Nationalist troops.”
There is no reference to this.
Dr. Patterson's referance is the
New York Tims, of March 27th,
1947.

Such evidence is not credita-
ble. The New York Times went
out of its way to brain-wash the
American public to the effect

that Castro was an ‘‘agrarian
reformer” and the George
Washington of Cuba.

Either the New York Times
was totally corrupt in helping
Castro to power, or it was in-
credibly stupid. It certainly has
no status in the field of historic-
al evidence.

Formosa (called Taiwan by
the Japanese while they ‘‘own-
ed” it) was mostly occupied by
its aborigines who were not
Chinese. In the 16th century

Portuguese and Spaniards at-
tempted colonization. In 1624
the Dutch built a fort and stay-
ed around 37 years.

When the Manchus prevailed
over the Ming dynasty, Ming
adherents under Formosa’s na-
tional hero Koxinga ruled For-
mosa as an INDEPENDENT
nation (not a province of China).

The grandson of Koxinga
ceded the island to the Manchus.
The. people had no choice. It

was ceded in 1895 to Japan by

the treaty of Shimonoseki. The
resident Chinese objected AND
DECLARED A REPUBLIC but
the Japanese took possession by

force. The Japanese, after the
Cairo conference in 1943, sur-
rendered it to the NATIONAL-
IST CHINESE.

In Sept. 1923 Mikhail M. Gru-
senberg, alias Michael Borodin,
a Russian communist, arrived
in Canton and from that date
began the discord and erosion
of the Nationalist movement.

Russian Communists played
upon every event, at times join-
ing the Kuomintang Nationalist
movement, even fighting with
it against Japan, but always
with the view of taking over
for communism.

This Russian conspiracy kept
Chiang from unifying the coun-
try, and in time, as is usually

tthe result of any coalition wtih

communism, the Nationalists,
fighting war lords, Japanese
and the communist party, lost
and withdrew to Formosa.
Nobody has a valid claim to
Formosa. Most thinking people
will agree that if the popula-
tion of Formosa could choose its

leader and its form of govern-.

ment, it would not choose the
kind of masters and the form

of bloody slavery that is com-
munism.

No populace knowingly votes
to live behind Berlin Walls, Iron
Curtains and Bamboo curtains.
Man's lust for power is such
that no one can say what is in
store for Formosa.

Let us hope it is not the fate
of Tibet and Cuba.

To The Editor:

In the interest of truth, I
must set the record straight as
to the only error to be found
in Cecil Burney’s article about
the abortion of THE DAVIDSON
REPUBLICANS (‘Morey And
Crew Execute Blistering Repub-
lican Coup,” THE DAVIDSON-
IAN, November 5, 1971).

The error is that Bill Esk-
ridge, a junior, was grouped
with ‘“‘Morey’s arch-conserva-
tive cohorts.” Bill ‘was, in fact,
a key member of ovr group~

than just an exchange of in-
formation. It involves an ex-
change of feelings, of experi-
ences. My greatest learning ex-
periences have occurred when I
have to put my feelings and
my beliefs out in the open for.
others to examine and to ques-
tion.

The examination and ques:
tioning went beyond the realm
of academics. It came to a
point of questioning who I real-
ly was as opposed to who I
professed to be. Very few of
these learning experiences have
occurred at Davidson. ;

Davidson has an academic en-
vironment. This is not in ques-
tion. What is in question is the
validity of Davidson as an ed-
ucational community. As an ed-.
ucational community Davidson
is severely lacking.

The sterility of this education-
al community is echoed in its
emphasis on reading great vol-
ume of material, and then pro-
viding little or no outlet for ex-
perience to supplement this
reading.

The sterility is echoed in the
student fear of writing papers.
Papers should be means of ex-
pression and exploration of one’s
views and feelings on a parti-
cular subject. Papers are a
drudgery and cause great an-
xiety for most students.

The sterility is echoed in the
lack of interest in the arts at
Davidson. Artistic expression
involves the exposition of part
of one’s self to the world. Few
desire the chance for this ex-
pression and few are interested
in experiencing this expression.
Artistic expression is a form of
sharing. Too few people on this
campus wish to share their
humanness with others.

Perhaps it is not that hope-
less. There are people on this
campus interested in Davidson
as an educational community.
They go about sharing with
others in a very quiet manner.
These are the people who can
help Davidson be more than just
another small college in the
South.

Still I could not help but feel
the futility of it all as I walked
across an empty, wind-blown
campus on the Sunday beginning
Thanksgiving break. I realized
that I actually enjoyed David-
son more when no one was on
campus and school. was not in
session, and it seemed a little
ludicrous to feel that way.

‘Burney Column Corrected

which worked to form an open,
representative, and broadly-bas-
ed Republican organization on
the Davidson College campus,
and was in no way associated
with the Morey group.

I would like to publicly thank
Mr. Burney for his analytical
as well as accurate reporting
of the meeting (except for that.
error) for the truth is always
welcomed.
