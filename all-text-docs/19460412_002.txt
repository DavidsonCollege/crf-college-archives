Elections... .

One of man’s greatest failings is that
he too frequently criticizes his fellow man,
usually behind his back. Being far from
perfect, we are quite often guilty of that
here at Davidson. However the condemn-
ing feature of it here is that the objects of
our cristicism are campus leaders who we
have put into office, or whom we have let
somcone else put into office.

Yes, you've guessed it! Elections are
here, During the past two weeks some three
hundred men have been casting their votes
in the lobby of Chambers every morning.
And in all probability a large per cent of
those voted: just as a matter of routine in-
stead of a seriously considered duty.

In our election system the feature about
which we boast so much is the absence of
politics. However, this has been in one-way

sented to the student body. In fact, a num-
ber of students have been heard to remark
that it was a very poor state of elections
when so many students didn’t even know
the candidates running for office. Of
course, a partial answer to-this question is
due to the fact that a large number of for-
mer Davidson students who returned to the
college at the beginning of this semester
haven't had enough time to get to know the
ramainder of the student body, and. visa
versa. Thus many of us find ourselves in
utter confusion when we try to vote. Con-
cerning those who have already been elect-
ed to the various offices, what about in-
troducing them to the student body? And
in future elections why not introduce the
candidates to the student body with a word
about each one? It would save a lot of time
and confusion on election day,

At present the only way-in Which a vot-
er can learn of the qualifications of a
candidate is on his own initiative. If you
have not done so already, look around, see
what goes on, ask those who are in a posi-

Our Alma eMater....

and Davidson is no exception. True we do
have an excellent fight song, which we
have been using for quite a number “of
years, and which we definitely want to con-
tinue to use.

However, “down ever foe” and “through
their lines we run” doesn’t sound exactly
appropriate to sing at commencement exer-
cises. That is the reason for wanting to
adopt an alma mater song for the college,
and “All Hail, 0; Dayidson!” seems to fill
the bill.

Several years ago red Waring compos-
ed an alma mater song for Davidson,
“Davidson, Our Alma Mater”, but that
proved a little inefficient for our use. Dur-
ing, Davidson's centennial year, the present
almaamater song was composed, It’s an ex-

A Current Topic .. ...

The present student attitude here at
Davidson seems to indicate that there is
some feeling: of dissatisfaction in regard
to our dances. This is particularly true a-
mong those who have recently return-
ed to school—those who have—been ex-
posed to Davidson Dances before the war.

For many years there was much
agitation in the student-body to be allow-
ed to have the dances on the campus,
instead of in Charlotte. Now that it has
come to pass that we can have our dances
on the tampus, there must be some rea-
son why everyone is not in accord with
the present set-up. Surely it can’t be that
“the other side of the fence looks
greener”.

To the contrary, this attitude seems
to hinge around the fact that, with the
permission to have dances here at David-
son, the rules governing the lodging and
hours of the dates are too strict. Realiz-
ing, of course, that the college is re-
sponsible for the dances and that there
must be some regulation; nevertheless,
the time limit for bringing the dates in
after the dance seems somewhat unrea-
sonable.

If the girls must be required to stay
in an assigned place with a definite hour
for coming in, could not the time limit
after the dances be lengthened one hour?
This would mean that the curfew on
Friday nights would be at three-thirty,
and Saturday nights one-thirty. It is
rather difficult from the students’ point
of view to believe that such a request as
this would be too radical for dances at
Davidson.

Other requests such as the one above
have been made to the faculty since the
Midwinters Dance Set. One in the form
of a petition signed by the members of!
the Panhellnic Council. Another, when a
faculty committee and certain representa-
tives of the student body had-a discussion
on the dance situation. I, for one, should
like to see some difinite action taken by
the faculty on this matter before the
Spring Dances.
