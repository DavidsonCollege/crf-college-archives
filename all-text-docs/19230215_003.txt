Had you ever stopped to think that
The rooster, like a lot of men,
Can crow to beat the deuce ;
But when you crowd him for results,

You find he can’t produce?

The Hooting of Jane McChew
(With apologies to Service)

A group of the girls were whooping it up in
the Grecian candy store;

The nickel piano was pounding out the latest
Broadway score;

Back of the bunch, with a hot nut fudge,
sat Dangerous Jane McChew,

And watching her eat was her favorite snake,
the lizard that’s known as Lou.

When off of the street where the rain beat
down and into the jazz and glare,

There hurried a maiden fresh from a date
with very disheveled hair;

She seemed like a girl that was down and out
and her looks were beginning to fade,

But she stopped at the counter and called for
a box of the finest candy made.

And we tried to tell by her perfume’s smell,
in vain whence this flapper flew,

But we ate her fudge and the last to eat was
Dangerous Jane McChew.

A MERRY DRAMA
In Many Acts and Numberless
Scenes

Introducing “The Freshman,” or to speak
campus wise “Fresh,” a verdant member of
'26, who constantly craves information. It
is our resolution that he shall be informed.

Characters:. “Mack” Lennox, a rather
prominent senior; he prides himself on the
nobbiness of his wardrobe; it is his private
opinion that he is a veritable lady-killer.

“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and no less
prominent junior; in matter of dress, his
taste is more conservative and substantial;
in regard to his love affairs the old adage,
“Still water runs deep,” is applicable.

Act the Fourth
The Dope Sheet

Fresh—Say, how long is it going to rain
up here, cold as all-forty, too?

Bill—Son, when thou hast been here as
long as I, thou wilt not wonder but will be
content with thy lot.

Mac (he has been reading)—Say, boys,
listen to this will you—

(Bill and the Freshman are taken tn-
awares so they have to endure it.)

Women are very perverse and contrary,
They will contradict you flat;

Oh, women I'll call the devil and all,
There’s no denying that!

But, woman, oh, men, is beyond our ken,
Too angelic for mortals below;

How little they know of woman

Who only women know!

Bill—Keep quiet now will. you? (Mac
subsides.)

Fresh—It’s still cold but Junior Speaking
will soon be here and that means new clothes
—what’s the dope.

Bill—Was down to Charlotte the other
day and saw the advance sheets of Hart,

| Schaffner and Marx.

Fresh—What did it feature? _
Bill—The dope is that Norfolk’s and other

#| sport models will be pretty generally worn,
#i|the conservative coat being conspicuous by
i | its absence except for the older men. Gray
#|/and tan mixtures will predominate with a
# | liberal sprinkling of the tropicals in worsteds
| and mohairs.

Fresh—Who handles Hart, Schaffner and
Marx hereabouts?

Bill!—Mellon will have a complete line.

Fresh—Reckon that I will have to drop

Song of the freshmen after receiving the
|dear letters from the Registrar last week:
To school I came with hopes all high,

My heart was beating fast —
But now I find it’s do or die—
I’m dying on the grass.

On the grass outside the library,
There on the campus green—

And I looked while she worked the‘slot ma-|
chine to see what gum she’d chew,

While watching her as his face turned pale |
was the lizard that’s know as Lou.

“Light of my life, Mazda!” he whispered.
“Sole of my sole, Fiber!” she replied.

| tion presents this year.

spoiled by soreness re-

with Vicks often gives
surprising relief.
