THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 12, 1923

OPEN LETTER TO THE
CLASS OF ’22

Dear Classmates:

No doubt your experiences have been
Many and varied since we were together
about this time last year; and your thought
occasionally dwell on the good times we had
together at our old Alma Mater. In fact
my experiences one year ago were more
pleasant than they are today and for that
reason I feel that it is advisable for me to
forsake the profession of teaching and go
to Union Seminary next year.

Getting to the business of the moment,
though, I believe we would all enjoy a trip
to Davidson this year for Commencement.
From all accounts '23 is going to put things
over in fine stple this spring and I doubt if
there’ll hardly be room for us since this is
not our year for a reunion, but I do believe
a reunion will be worth>more to us this
year before we are all scattered. Our reg-
ylar time for a reunion comes in 1927 but
you know time works changes and I believe
weAvill enjoy a reunion this year more than
we will at any other time. Now we must
have a vote on this question, so I want to
ask each of you to drop me a card at-your
earliest convenience and let me know about
it. My .address is Hartwell,

Meanwhile remember our pledge to Dav-
idson. Remember we are 100% behind ath-
letics, the Davidsonian, and the Student Gov-
ernment and to show our love for the old

Georgia.

effects of such conditions on nations of the
past and the probable effects on America if

Relationship to the League.. He showed that

L. D. Elkins was the last orator. His
subject was Lincoln’s Heritage. The race

The Reel Stuff

Donna, featuring Pola Negri. Athena she
has been seen before on the American screen
this is her first real American picture. The
cast of Bella Donna includes Conrad Nagel
and Lois Wilson.

Pola Negri is at her best in the portrayal
of such characters as Bella Donna, a notor-
ious woman who marries an English engi-
neer, Nigel Armine, played by Conrad Nagel.
When they go to Egypt the spell of the
tropics completely transforms her, and when
she meets Baroudi, a desert chieftan, played
by Conway Tearle, she forgets her hus-
band’s love and clings to him passionately.
When he suggests that she gain her free-
dom by poisoning her husband she readily
agrees. Nigel narrowly escapes death,| and
when he learns the truth their separation
follows. Then comes the supreme ELLA) pean EOE

of the story—Bella’s return to Baroudi only
to find herself scorned, her agony on seeing
her husband cared for by the woman he
really loves (Lois Wilson) and her vanish-
ing into the desert in the face of a fierce
sand storm. In these scenes Pola Negri is
at her best, and thrill after thrill is pro-
voked by her wonderful artistry.

On April 28th, Robin Hood will be shown
here. It is an Allan Dawn production, and
has run a full season in New York, showing
every day to a crowded house. This fic-
ture is considered to be Douglas Fairbank’s

supreme achievement.
