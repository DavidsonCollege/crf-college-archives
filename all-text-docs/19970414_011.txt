THE DAVIDSONIAN

Temple of the Dog —

One fan sniffs through Hayes Trotter’s senior art
exhibit, finds good food, good company, drool.

This is what I just happened to
see at Hayes Trotter’s Senior Art
Show, an exhibit.centered around
dogs, one day. I remember the day
clearly: a crisp breeze flowed from
bright blue skies after a heavy rain
the night before. The moist ground
and renewed grass made my walk
over adelight. I often stopped to dig
my toes into the soil, getting joy-
fully dirty in the practice of zen
total digging. I ran through some
puddles to make my feet present-
able for the VAC, slowing down
around the tired tulips outside to
sprinkle them with more water.
‘Someone was gracious enough to
open the door for me.

Immediately I was torn be-
tween radiant Competition and In-
credible Hunger, but the green dog
in the latter triumphed over
Competition’s hue — or was it the
brooding block of cheddar? Jn-
credible Hunger made my tummy
burn and my heart growl. I didn’t
know Sunshine could produce so
many Cheez-itz.

On my way to Desire, I gave
Restraint a soft pat on the nose and
took out a tissue — to blow my own
nose. His open ears told me he:soon
would be holding his snout at least
level. Back to Desire, I'll admit my
own drool missed the bowl and
stained the carpet when I saw that
button. I was Pavlov’s second con-
ditioned best friend.

Effortlessly I missed Desire’s
natural fur and warm eyes because
his long, strong tongue sucked me
into his abysmal mouth. That’s
when I noticed his dull canines and
well-loved bowl.

The Wager made me look at
my own tags and how tightly they
grasp me. I’m glad my father’s my
father and I’m myself.

that box; I didn’t even have to check.
The dog’s gentle tongue and soft
noseconvinced me of it. Plus Nila’s
original orange made me think of
sunshiny recesses.

Trying to walk past Competi-
tion to view Anonymous, Competi-
tion shot some splinters into my
skin. Ouch. No more dull canines,
but they were dull to each other.
Now more than tongues were thick,
so were coats, and muscles — bulg-
ing, flexed. I prayed that last collar
would stay on. Premiers, U.S.
Opens, and X-Outs rallied with that
sea of envy.

Yet they could notace the prac-

tice ball and the fur underneath them,
just as the sea of envy could not
reach the ocean’s floor.
Anonymous reminded me that
dogs have innocent tails and big,
stable paws, huggable bodies and
attentive ears, active hind legs and
determined eyes. They got it all.
Nothing less. If I forget this, I plan
to curl up in Jmpatience’s cheeks.
Upon leaving I snatched a muf-
fin and slurped up some water from
the fountain, leaving the remnants
on my face. Dogs seek the natural,
unaware of fat grams. They eat the

‘real thing. Yum. Thanks for the

home cooking Hayes.

Get Pumped: How to Make $25

My Visa bill started this grand
adventure. I realized quickly that
after 1 emptied my bank account, I
still needed $127.16 to break even.
Perhaps I shouldn’t have flown to
San Francisco that one time, or
maybe the shopping spree at Target
was a little excessive (thanks any-
way SGA Shuttle). The fact of the
matter is, I have six weeks before
my job at the Physical Plant kicks
in, 46° on declining, no meal plan
and no income. What’s a girl todo?
I reevaluated my resources and ap-
praised my net worth to be a neat
pair of plastic Target pumps, a fairly
clean health record and eight pints
of blood flowing through me. Un-
fortunately, because my Target re-

ceipt had been confiscated by a
rather rude Wal-Mart employee in
a failed attempt to return a half
empty jar of apricot facial scrub,
the Alpha Plasma Center (332-
1510) was my only option that didn’t
involve aluminum cans on the side
of the highway.

Linda, R.N., greeted me witha
preliminary interview which in-
cluded being weighed-in, answer-
ing rather personal questions about
my sexual activity and checking for
visible piercings and tattoos. With
my mouth firmly shut and my shirt
tucked in (I didn’t figure my tongue
stud, navel ring, or that itty-bitty
star on my lower back really
counted), she assessed that the glass
of water and two Advil I had for
breakfast was not sufficient and
gave me a peanut butter sandwich. ©
On to phase two.

I sat in the waiting room dis-
cussing the currentrumors surround-
ing Bobbi Brown and Whitney
Houston. According to a man with
five teeth, they’re both “smokin’
the shit,” and that’s why she’s been
more mellowed out lately. My new
found friends and I moved into the
main room and were hooked up to
ourown humming white centrifuges.
I’m not going to beat around the
bush on this, they stuck me with a
BIG needle and it hurt. However,
the momentary pain dissolved when
I realized that one of the seven big
screen TVs was carrying semi-pro
wrestling. Next thing I knew The
Undertaker was the new World
Champion and a pint of my blood
had been sucked, spun, separated,
and injected back into me (minus
