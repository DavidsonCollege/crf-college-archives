which time Edgar walked off
the floor.

When asked for a reason for
this action Edgar replied, ‘‘Be-
cause the club was under the
unit rule and I was being con-
sistently out-voted, and therefore
five votes were being cast in
favor of proposals that I could
not conscientiously vote for as a
representative of the Davidson
club. I left the convention to
show -my displeasure.”

When the amendment passed.
Clark withdrew his candidacy,
and Beard was elected without
opposition.

In the closing minutes of the
convention when a resolution
supporting the controversial
“Speaker-Ban Law” was intro-
duced only three delegates from
Davidson remained on the floor.
All three voted in favor of the
proposal, but Edgar, one of
those absent, had this to say
about the situation:

“I do not feel that the action’

taken by the Young Republicans
at the Charlotte convention, es-
pecially in regard to the ‘‘Speak-
er-Ban Law.” conforms to the
beliefs of the Davidson Club.

“IL fully believe that at the
meeting on Feb. 10, the action
taken will be repudiated. In oth-
er words, the club will adopt a
resolution opposing the Speak-
er-Ban Law.”

Such action was taken at the
meeting this past Wednesday
night.

Regarding the political views
of those present at the conven-
tion, Edgar commented, ‘It was
right interesting to note, after
talking with the various candi-
dates for offices, that when I
questioned them on their ideal-

MH

ogical beliefs I got such answers
as, ‘I am a Libertarian conser-
vative’ or ‘I am a true consre-
vative’ or ‘I am a true conser-
the reply. ‘I am a Republican
first.’

“From these personal obser-
vations it would seem that quite
a few people have not learned
the lesson of November, 1964,
when too many people consid-
ered themselves conservatives
first.and Republicans second.

“Tt is my personal opinion
that persons holding such views
are inconsistent with Article II,
section four of the constitution
of the North Carolina Federation
of Young Republicans, which
states that ‘The objectives of
this organization shall be to
support the principles, objec-
tives, and platform of the Re-
publican party throughout the
state of North Carolina. . .

“Nowhere does the word con-
servative appear in place of the
word Republican. I fully be-
lieve that there is a place in the
Republican party for all shades
of political opinion — conserva-
tive, moderate, or liberal — not
just for one group.”

Carolina Speaker Ban Law.
In other business Fred
Sackett, speaking for the Coun-
cil’s elections committee, said
that he would present proposals
for changes in election pro-
cedure at the next meeting.

Sackett offered, however, a
general outline of the commit-
tee’s coming proposals.

The committee, he said, hopes
to finish the elections in a
period of five days this year.

The committee also considered
providing more campaign mater-
‘jals such as poster board and
platform sheets after charging
each candidate a one-dollar fee
to help defray the costs of elec-
tion materials.

Sackett added that the com-
mittee would suggest that candi-
dates not be allowed to run for
both the Honor Court and Stu-

tion. A vacancy was created, dent Council office at the same

time. This was permissible last
year.

Modern Jazz
At Vespers Sunday

Modern jazz will be featured
at Vespers in observance of the
World Student Day of Prayer
this Sunday night.

The unusual service will be-
gin with a jazz prelude and end
with a jazz postlude; both
hymns will be accompanied by
a jazz trio consisting of pianist
Sidney Farrar, who wrote the
music for the occasion, drum-
mer Dave Hoag, and Mare
Hansen on the string bass.

Presiding will be George
Kuykendall, who wrote the
three parts of the theme of
“Crucified, Dead, and Buried,"
Aiding in the music will be
soloist (Rufus Ha‘lmark.

Instead of the usual sermon
introductions to three speech-
es, “The Sickness Unto Death,”
“Thus Spake Zarathustia,”” and
“The Dream of a Ridiculous
Man,” respectively signifying
man’s alienation in the modern
world, his rejection of now
untenable bases for faith, and
what he finds to replace these.

Such use of jazz in church
services, while new at Davidson,
is not unknown in the large
cities of the United States and
Europe where jazz has not only

been used in Protestant cere-
monies but also in Roman

Catholic Mass.

eo o¢ @

These proposals drew much
critical comment from the rep-
resentatives.

Billy Clark questioned the ex-
cessive use of campaign mater-
ials asking, “What are the val-
ues of slogans all over the
john?”

Sackett allowed that such,:

slogans and posters “added to
the interest and color of the
elections.” .

Will Jackson pointed out that
in previous years it has be-
come difficult to enter a toilet
stall “without scraping the plat-
forms aside.” He suggested thai
the committee considered iimit-
ing the posting of platforms to
specific areas or the dorm rooms
alone.

Jackson admitted that there
was value in posting platforms,
“but cramming them under
doors and posting them on the
walls in every head was not the
way to do it.”

Tom Frist suggested that plat-
forms be posted only in the
basement of Chambers on one
board. This, he felt, might elim-
inate some of the mess and
still fulfill a necessary function

David Walker flinched at the
proposal to charge a fee to de-
fray costs saying. ‘All I've got
to my name is two dimes and
one of them is defaced.” This
outlay of money, he felt, might
keep some persons who would
like to run for office out of
the elections.

The problems of fraternity
bloc voting were also discussd.
Billy Clark said that he “hated
to see fraternities vote against
a candidate.

Johnny Gresham asked if set-
ting up a party system might
mot correct this problem.
Sackett felt that such a move
would merely aggravate the sit-
uation, referring to possible in-
ter-party bitterness and a pit-
ting of what he called the six
“out’’ groups. .

At last week's meeting Bill
Council asked if the bookstore
inventory might be improved to
include books for personal read-
ing. Jackson reported this week
that he had talked to Peter
Nicholls, manager of the book-
store about this idea, and that
Nicholls hed said that he did
Rot want the bookstore to be
in competition with such places
as The Hub.

Bill Council was the only
Council member absent from
this meeting.

Referring to what calls a

Crawford Discusses
Academy Honor Code

Surprised by the exist-

ence of serious honor code
violations, Johnny Craw-
ford, a Davidson junior who
spent a semester at the Air
Force Academy, concludes
that there was no ring or
organized group of dishon-
est boys at the Academy,
“just a bunch of guys who
got into something they
couldn't get of.”
He blamed the pressures of
grades and regulations more
than anything else -for causing
the boys who bought exams
to do so. Once they had, they
were trapped until they were
discovered.

Crawford asserts the honor
code itself seems to be ‘more

a police force than something

the cadets could be proud of”
in that it bound .boys too tight-
ly to a code which would be
respected without the numer-
ous regulations and penalties.

It causes the cadets, who
are honest and would be even
without having honesty impos-
ed upon them, to feel some-
what uncomfortable abbput
constantly watching t h e m-
selves to avoid commiting some
unintentional violation of it.
In other words, the cadets

Mrs. Peter Nicholls, super-
visor of dormitories, reports that
room accommodations for dates
are not so crowded as during
Homecoming, and everyone
seems to be settled. After one
dance weekend they have ob-
served that the girls are more
prone to leave things than to

When the formal dance was
held in the gym the game was
necessarily scheduled away,
but now the schedule will be
set regardless of social plans.
Driesell also commented that
the games were not scheduled
necessarily to keep players
away from parties and social
functions.

Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts observed that there was
no particular increase in discip-
linary problems on dance week-
ends, except for infrequent re-
ports of noise at fraternity par-
ties. He did comment on the
lack of a set curfew on girls
staying in the dorms like most
other schools.

Burts feels the school should
take an increased measure of
control over this situation and
discontinue the policy of yield-
ing to the students’ wishes.

According to Burts, since the
school accepts responsibility for
accommodating the girls, it also
should assume a degree of con-
trol over the on-campus situa-
tion. He pointed out that since
the dorms have been opened to
girls, the social life has seemed
to evolve more and more to off-
campus parties.

when it seemed that others committed at any time during

canot confess and expect for-

Coach Smith believes that the
most important result of this
affair is not the dismissal of

‘are not allowed too much emy of those boys who knew
human error out there. about the selling of the exams,
but who did not tell any auth-
ority.

Accoring to the honor code
at the academy, the student
must report any boy who breaks
any part of the cide or he is
lable to dismissal himself.

According to Smith, an un-
undisclosed number of boys did
know about the dis-honest ac-
tions of their fellow cadets,
yet they did not tell, thus mak-
ing themselves, according to
the honor code, as dishonest
as their fellow cadets who
were directly involved in the
buying or selling of exams.

By not dismissing these boys,
although they were clearly lia-
ble to dismissal, the academy
has set a precedent which
Coach Smith believes will stand.

They were not dismissed, it
! is surmised, for practical rea-
; sons, and now that this pre-
cedent has been established,
it seems that it must surely
honor code which would do
away with the articles requir-
ing boys to report their fel-
low students. (Davidson has
a such resuirement in Article
VU, Section 4 of the Student
Constitution.) ‘

:  Davidson’s new ‘head foot-
ball coach, feels this clause is
somewhat impractical as it is

, against human nature for one

to inform on his friends. He

points this out by offering the
illustation of a child's being
taught by his parents not to

“tattle” almost from infancy.
By the time one is an adult,

or nearly so, he has come to
regard informing or tattling
as wrong. Any rule requiring
him to inform on a friend, no
matter how noble a purpose.
is against his instinctive and
moral precepts.

Coach Smith's philosophy on
the subject of an honor system
and its value can really be
summed up by the following:
“] believe you become honest
by practicing honesty, and an
honor system gives the students
a chance to become honest by
practicing honesty.”

Crawford feels that the boys
who were hurt most by the
cheating, other than the ones
who ware directly involved,
are those leaving school for
academic or personal reasons
at the same time as the ones
who are dismissed. By leav-
ing with the boys who were.
dismissed the innocent have
put themselves under sus-
picion at home, even though
they know they had no part
in the scandal.

Also hurt were boys who
flunked out because others

who bought exams made high-
er grades that they normally
would have. (The academy is
on a strictly competitive basis.)

Finally Crawford believes
that the Air Foce Academy
should perhaps, adopt an honor
code iike that of Annapolis
where the “fourth point’, or
the provision obligating a stu-
dent to tell on fellow students,
does not exist. This, he fee!s,
makes the cadets feel more
comfortable under the honor
system and would prove much
more practical.
