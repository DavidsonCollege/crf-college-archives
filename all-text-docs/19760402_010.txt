Netters stop Ohio,
doubles improving

By BILL WINKENWERDER
Staff Writer

The Davidson College ten-
nis team brought its record to
9-5-1 with two convincing
victories and a disappointing
defeat in the last week of play.

The Wildcat netters crushed
Ohio University 9-0 in a match
played at Davidson Friday.

Coach Jeff Frank seemed
pleased with the overall play,
but was reserved in his com-
ment. ‘‘We played better
doubles, but primarily we just
have a better team.”

The Wildcats suffered a 1-8
setback in hosting North Car-
olina State University on Sat-
urday.

The Wolfpack netters domi-
nated the match with both
strong singles and doubles
play. The only bright spot for
Davidson was number four
man Steve Holman who won
his match 6-1, 6-3.

Coach Frank appeared dis-
appointed in losing by such a
wide margin, but alluded to
the perennial problem David-
son has against ACC compe-
tition. ‘‘They have scholar-
ships and that makes a diffe-
rence. They are just a much
stronger team.”

The Wildcats bounced back
to thrash Pfeiffer 9-0 Monday.
Number one singles player
Chip Bondurant played well in
whipping Knug Van Nostrand
6-3, 6-3.

Davidson hosts an always
tough Harvard team Thurs-

day. ‘‘We have lost to them
the last two years. We will
have to play well to win,’’
emphasized Frank.

A win in Saturday’s match
against the Citadel is neces-
sary for the Wildcats to have a
chance for the Southern Con-
ference championship. The
meeting against conference-
preseason favorite Furman
Monday is also very impor-
tant.

“Our singles have been good
so far (Mike Barnhill 10-4,
John Mitchell 10-5, and Steve
Holman 11-4(, but our doubles
have been slow to come
around. We seem to be im-
proving, however,’’ com-
mented Coach Frank.

‘‘Last year we came on in
our doubles at the end of the
season and I think we will this
year, too,’”’ he said.

Batters split VMI doubleheader

Wolfpack capitalizes on Cat errors

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor

Duvidson’s baseball team is
slowly coming out of its hit-
ting slump but was plagued by
errors last week as they split
with VMI in a doubleheader
and lost to N.C. State.

Despite a poor overall re-
cord the Wildcats were able to
improve their conference re-
cord to 3-1 in their first game

against VMI, winning 5-4.
Joel Tew looked strong as he
went all the way on the mound
for Davidson and Freshman
Tim Goodall hit a three run
homer to provide the winning
margin.

In the second game, a se-
venth inning rally fell one run
short as the Wildcats cut a 5-1
deficit to 5-4. The final out
came with two men on base
and dropped the Wildcats to

3-2 in conference play.

Mike Hall started on the
mound but had to be:relieved
by Alan Alig. VMI scored
three unearned runs in the
fourth inning as Davidson
committed two costly errors
and Hall was forced to take
the loss.

Coach Palmer Meunch cited
lack of hitting power in the
second game as the reason for
the loss.

“Our hitting has been get-
ting better, especially in the
last -week, but in the second
VMI game we didn’t hit well
until our last inning rally.”

Rick Blinkhorn continues to
lead the team in batting with a
strong .372 average. Stan
Brown is the only other Wild-
cat batting over .300, hitting
at a .327 clip.

As a team Davidson had
displayed very little fire power
and has a dismal .220 team
batting average.

In a game played Monday
at Raleigh, the Wildcats suf-
fured through a rash of eight
errors and gave up five un-
earned runs in losing to the
Wolfpack 5-2. Muench is
pleased, however, with the
overall progress of the team.

“Our pitching is coming
along real well with Joel Tew
starting to come around after
a slow start.

‘‘Ron Cannon started his
first game against State and
did an excellent job. He went
the distance and surprised me
with the way he pitched,” said
Muench.

Tuesday’s game with league
leading Furman was rained
out twice and will be resche-
duled for later in the season.
The Paladins are currently 3-0
in the conference and are
picked by Muench as the team
to beat.

He also believes that David-
son will be able to make a
strong bid for the title. -

“*T think our chances are
very good now. We won't have
quite as many games each
weekend and hopefully I’ll be
able to use my top two or three
pitchers all the time. Also as
the hitting improves we're
getting better team balance.”’

Muench’s team is very
young and he is encouraged by
the improved play of his
freshmen.

“The freshmen are helping
us very much. Tim Goodell is
playing good defense at cat-
cher and getting key hits. Tim
McDowell at first and Jim
Richards at short stop are also
playing fine defense.”’
