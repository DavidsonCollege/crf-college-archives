She Ravidsanian

Mad Maehine Turns Poet

The lights blink, and suddenly the typewriter
comes to life and types: “HIS SECOND YELLOW YEAR
BEHOLD IN LOVE.”

Davidson's IBM 1320 is writing poetry—at least
that is the claim of sophomore Don Hoyt, who has
been working on the program for five months.

While he admits that the computer has not yet
produced any immortal lines, he hopes that even-
tually it will produce poems that make “at least a
little bit of sense.”

Hoyt began writing his program last semester
while taking Dr. Jerry Roberts’ Math 21 course, an
introduction to computers. ;

“Since then I’ve gotten more than a little extra
help from Dr. Roberts,” Hoyt admitted. “The prob-
lems involved in a program like this are just tremen-
dous. Even the simplest operations, which people take
for granted, such as providing each word with the
proper amount of space in the line, require complex
instructions when working with a computer.”

Hoyt explains the program as consisting of three
basic steps: .

—The computer reads from cards a list of words,
in this case the words of Shakespeare's Sonnet No. 73
(“There's no particular reason for the choice; I just
needed a list of words.) Each word is coded for length.
stress, and part of speech.

—The computer “memorizes” the words. .
—The computer fetches the words from its “memory
and strings them together into a line of ‘poetry.’

“Actually,” Hoyt explained. “there are several
programs in existence now. One of them puts any old
words together, so that the resull is non-sensical free
verse.”

Hoyt grew tired of nonsense and he began
working on a program that could compose meaning-
ful lines. With this program he types in a series of
numbers which provide the machine a pattern. A
zero, for example, stands for a noun.

“T've had the best success with 1220171220. This
is the pattern of the sentence found in most typing
texts, ‘The quick red fox jumped over the lazy brown
dog.’ The computer will typically hand me back a re-
sponse like:

“HIS SECOND YELLOW YEAR HANG IN HIS
YELLOW BLACK LOVE THOSE STRONG BLACK
DAY SEEST BY THOSE FEW SWEET NIGHT.”

Many people ask how the computer knows which
word to choose so that it will fit the meter or the
syntax’ of the line. Hoyt answers, “It doesn’t. It just
keeps choosing words at random and if the coding for

that word happens to fit, then it uses it. If it doesn’t,
then the computer just keeps on looking.”

Others question Hoyt's seriousness. He smiles
and says, “Oh, I’m deadly serious. The computer
even signs its own work. At the end of every com-
position it types: THE IBM 1620.”

‘No, really, I don't expect the computer to write
great poetry. I'm just interested in seeing what I can
program it to do. Not only have J learned a great deal
about programming, but I’m being forced to take a

Speaking for the court.
sophomore Stagg Newman
said that regulations in the
old constitution are still in
effect, and that the penalties
range from removal from the
dormitory to suspension.

‘We are asking to be self-

governing.”’ explained New-
man. ‘‘and if we are, we
must be able to enforce our

Drinking Change Sparks

Trustee Disagreement

By BOB REID
Pssociate Editor

Trustee opinion on drinking
on campus seems divided in
the face of the proposals of
the Committee on Rules and
Punishments (CRAP).

A random sampling of
trustees revealed a_ wide
variation on the issue. “I’m
old fashioned." -said The
Reverend: John Redhead of
Greensboro. "I've known too
many men here in Greens
boro who started drinking in
college and are miserable to.
day as a result.”

But Dr. Readhead's col-
league. The Reverend B.
Frank Hall of Wilmington.
differed on the subject. ‘I
think it's mere realism.’’ he

said concerning the propos-
als. “I have never been able
to reconcile telling a man
what he must do and training
him to make moral decis.-
ions. Prohibition denies the
right of moral decisions."
The issue of on-campus
drinking was again raised
this month when CRAP pro-
posed modification of the col-
lege’s position to allow limit
ed drinking on campus.
According to the present
faculty regulation, drinking
or possession of intoxicants
on campus may be punished
by suspension from the: col-
lege. But since the student
regulations prohibition was
lifted two years ago, no stu-
dent found guilty under the

Senate Approves
Judicial Bylaws

By DANNY WHITE
Steff Writer

The Senate Thursday ap-
proved the judiciary section
of the proposed student by-
laws after Honor Court
chairman Bill Williams sug-
gested several changes. in
the original draft of that sec.
tion.

Williams told the Senate
that he hoped the Honor
Court would not become an
“adversary court’’ but a
court whose primary func-
tion is simply the pursuit of
the truth of a specific case.

Accordingly, Article VI,
Section 2, dealing with the
defense adviser, was amend-

ed to say that the defense
adviser would act only as an
adviser to the defendant and
not as a legal counsel and
therefore would not in any
ease be required to testify
against the accused.

Article IV was passed by
the Senate with Williams’
Proposed amendments with
only one dissenting vote, that
of sophomore senator Rich-
ard Howard. John Passmore
was absent,

faculty rule has been sus.
pended. .

But if there are to be any
real changes in the college's
stand, the trustees must
grant their approval. And
not all trustees want to do
this.

“With all the problems
I've seen resulting from
drinking. I cannot in good
faith condone any change in
the rule,’ said The Reverend
Eugene D. Witherspoon of
Belmont ‘Practically all
marital problems I've
handled have resulted from
drinking."’

“I'm scared of liquor,” he '

added. “I'm dealing with a
boy right now whose family
is on the rocks for this very
reason.”

Mr. Peyton Woodson, pres.
ident of the Occidental Life
Insurance Company, and Jim
Bradley, a Davidson gradu-
ate now studying at Univer-
sity of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, will be the main
speakers.

, This is not a career day,”

according to Rick Harrell,
director of the program. ‘‘It
is an opportunity for  stu-
dents who are interested in
business as a career to find
out what they can do as busi-
nessmen and to talk about
these problems,”
* Harrell said that over haif,
of Davidson graduates go on
to business careers, and that
many of them feel that they
are ‘running away": from
the problems of the world.

“This is not just for stu-
dents who know they will go
into business.”’ said Harrell.
“Since so many Davidson
students end up in business,
they should all look into it.”

Student
Fined
Tuesday

A Davidson freshman con-
victed Tuesday in Mecklen-
burg County Recorder's
Court of trespassing on a
runway at Charlotte’s Doug-
las Airport said Wednesday
he would not appeal.

Jim Bradley, fined court
costs of about $14, said he
had neither the time nor the
money to appeal Judge Win-
fred Ervin's decision.

Similar charges against
three other freshmen were
dropped because of lack of
evidence.

The trespassing incident
took place April 9 when the
four, returning from Win.
throp College, stopped at the
airport to watch the planes
land.

Bradley said he was con-
victed on the testimony that
he was standing on the grass
near a runway with a police
officer.

Junior Ashton Trice has

Trice said that the main

was to give the student body

sons outside the college.
such as the alumni.

“IT don't think THE DAVID.

WAS KEATS THE BOB DYLAN

OF HIS DAY?

Who was the greatest of the English Romantic Poets—
Byron, Shelley or Keats? This question has given rise to
many lively campus discussions and not a few stabbings.
Let us today try to find an answer.

First, Keats (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is com-
monly called.) Keats’ talent bloomed early. While still a
schoolboy at St. Swithin’s he wrote his epic lines:

If Lam good I get an apple,

Sol don’t whistle in the chapel.

From this distinguished beginning he went on to write
another 40 million poems, an achievement all the more re-
markable when you consider that he was only five feet
tall! I mention this fact only to show that physical prob-
Jems never keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for
example, was lame. Shelley suffered from prickly heat all
winter long. Nonetheless, these three titans of literature
never stopped writing poetry for one day.

Nor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil
with the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping
Nell Gwynne’s pigtails in an inkwell. (This later became
known as Guy Fawkes Day.) He left England to fight in
the Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and
well, but women were never far from his mind, as evi-
denced by these immortal lines:

How splendid it is to fight for the Greek,

- But I don’t enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to

cheek.

While Byron fought in Greece, Shelley stayed in Eng-
land, where he became razor sharpener to the Duke of
Gloucester. Shelley was happy in his work, as we know
from his classic poem, Hail to thee, blithe strop, but no
matter how he tried he was never able to get a proper edge
on the Duke's razor, and he was soon banished to
Coventry. (This later became known as The Industrial

Revolution.)

One wonders how Shelley’s life—and the course of Eng-
lish poetry—would have differed if Personna Super Stain-
less Steel Blades had been invented 200 years earlier. For
Personna is a blade that needs no stropping, honing or
whetting. It's sharp when you get it, and sharp it stays
through shave after luxury shave. Here truly is a blade
fit for a Duke or a‘freshman. Moreover, this Personna,
this jewel of the blade-maker’s art, this boon to the cheek
and bounty to the dewlap, comes to you both in double-
edge style and Injector style. Get some now during “Be

Kind to Your Kisser Week.”

But I digress. Byron, I say, was in Greece and Shelley
in England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to
grow. Who does not remember his wistful lyric:

Although Iam only five feet high,

Some day I will look in.an elephant’s eye.

But Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,
touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This
too failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies man, took up with
Lucrezia Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley.
Shelley, a more domestic type, stayed home with his wife
Mary and wrote his famous poem:

1 love to stay home with the missus and write,

And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.

Mary Shelley finally got so tired of being bitten that

she went into another room and wrote

tein.

Upon reading the manuscript, Shelley and Byron got so

scared they immediately boo!

ed passage home to Eng-

land. Keats tried to go too, but he was so small that the
clerk at the steamship office couldn’t see him over the top
of the counter. So Keats remained in Rome and died of

shortness.

Byron and Shelley cried a lot and then together com-

posed this immortal epitaph:

Good old Keats, he might have been short,
But he was a great American and a heck of a good sport.

Truth, not poetry, is the concern of Personna, and
