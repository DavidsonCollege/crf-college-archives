About time to take a look at the Wildcat track team, now
that they have opened their season with a one-sided triumph
over. Maryville College’s team. It appears that Coach Heath
Whittle has well-balanced squad, with no shining light.
Members of the team are predicting an undefeated season,
and, looking over the schedule, we see no reason why this
shouldn’t be.

Bob Kellogg, Jack White, Dave Spencer, and Blanton Wil-
Hiamson each copped two first places and ten. points for the
Wildeat cause.’ Kellogg romped home to wins in the 880 and
the-anile, while White scored in the 100 and 220 yard dashes.
Spencer won the javelin and the broad jump, Williamson got
no competition in the two hurdle events.

In the weight events, the Wildeats appear especially
strong. “In the shot-put-Knoeller-and—Bell-ranked- first—and
second, Yoder, Freeze, and Knoeller finished in that order in
the discus. Another clean sweep was marked up in the broad
jump-when Spencer,.Jim Cowan, and Chase Brenizer finished
far ahead.

Hither And Yon

' Banks McFadden recently copped 25 points in one of the
Tigers’ track meets ... And that despite the fact that Clem-
son boys were handing out the dope that he had low blood
pressure and wouldn’t be able to take part in any athletics . ...
Yankees drew $41,000 in four exhibition games en route North,
Chicken fced*to the Champs, who pay their third base coach
310,000 a year just to tell Keller, Dimaggio, and Company to
tag all the bases ... The opening game at Crosley Field in
Cincinnati is already a complete sell-out... But a record along
these lines—-for professional sport at least—is being set by
the Washington Redskins. Today, six months before the pro
football season starts, 7,500 tickets have been sold to Red-
skin games... A

paper man can be had... Eddie Shokes, Duke first sacker,
blasted a 475 foot drive into the hedge in right field against
me of the oft-beaten Yankee invaders—and that’s no bull . . +
Wonder why those teams don’t stay up there in their own
league. Maryland and Virginia routed the University of Pitts-
burgh 14-0, 19-5 on straight days ... The Wildcat netters did
quite a fine job in ticing Kalamazoo’s crack team... The bat-
tle of the year will be the Davidson-Presbyterian College
match to take place soon...

Rea Tenney, playing in the number one and two spot, is
as yet undefeated ... Worth reading is the recent story in
Collier’s about Nurmi and Maki, the two great Finnish dis-
tance runners. Maki once lost a race by a stride because
Nurmi had given his instructions to run the distance in a
certain time and Maki was afraid to disobey his master’s
