The Student’s Store has gone all year
without any words trom Tire Davip-
SONIAN, and we think that it is high time
that,something was said, not merely for
criticism but with the hope that the
managers will get off of the dime and
show a little improvement in the spots
Where it is most needed. However, criti-
cism does no good if there is not some
sort of corrective suggestion to go along
with it. It is now becoming the opinion
of one and all that the “stud” ain’t what
she used to be. Now, we all realize that
this is war and that things can’t be got-
ten that we had before the war. This is
not what. we are asking for. We merely
want the stud returned to the level that
it was on last fall and no more. We are
not continual gripers, but it is just plain
carclessness on the part of someone, and
we will not mention who, when the cool-
ers are empty and the store room is full
of drinks.. Also, It would be very nice
to be able to rely on its being open at one
time or another, Now
to find the doors open even if there is
nothing to be found after getting inside.
Seriously, it is high time that something
be done and we think that it is tp to the
managers to do it.

By BILL SMITH
Yes, the Student Store has gone all year

without words from the Davidsonian, and it
is perhaps time something was said.

Only a few moments before this paragr aph
was written | was informed by the staft of

The Davidsonian that the above paragraph
has been gathering’ dust in the socalled
Davidsoiian office for some weeks, waiting

to be printed when they could think of noth-
ing else. It seems to me that
sonian is reduced to sorry

Through the cloud of degeneracy that
surrounds’ Phe Davidsonian, things, other-
wise healthy, only appear degenerate to their
sickened gaze. One need only to compare a
last year’s Davidsonian with this issue to see
just what | mean.

I can see that true copstructive criticism is
fine, but the above ae Was written with a
fine disregard for facts. The Student Store
offers exactly what has always
with the exception of a few

been offered

articles which cannot be secured due to the ,

war. [t is true that some of the time the
store must remain closed, yet repeated pleas
have been made for clerks so that we might
remain open continuously, but to no avail.

The Student Store is appreciative of help-
ful criticism because the store is for the stu-
dents, but a more carefully considered criti-
cism should be forthcoming,

It has been suggested that we pay higher
salaries for clerking,s and this we would
gladly do except for the fact that the budget
won't permit it due to the~cost, of students
breaking bottles and forgetting to pay for
what they take from the store, which the
store assumes.

It might be well to add that what profits
thefe might be from the store goes into a
fund which is used for the improvement of
the Davidson campus or some other worthy
cause, so actually the money is returned
to the students.

It has also been suggested that we secure
a full time man to run the store. This would
be fine, because that would be less expensive
for us than the present student clerk system,
but he who suggested it failed to tell us
where’ we might find such a man.

In closing I still maintain that those who
criticise should be weHeainformed on what
they are criticizing, so that it will be true
and constrictive.
