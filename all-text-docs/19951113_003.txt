Speaker encoura

Stressing “public policy, not
public chaos,” Dr. Ralph da Costa
Nunez brought his vision of how to
help the homeless to the 900 Room
on November 8.

The event was cosponsored
by the Public Lectures Committee
and the Homelessness Committee
of Reach Out. It fell in the middle
of “Reach Out Into the Streets
Week,” the group’s annual service
drive.

“A decade ago I don’t know if
we could have done something for
a 19-year old [mother with chil-
dren].... Today, there is a window
of opportunity. The thing is to
make public policy and go through
it,” said Nunez.

With a conservative blue suit,

Strong messages of optimism, and
a string of statistics quoted from
memory, he won the support of the
audience of roughly 50 people,
coming off more as a businessman
making a specific proposal than a
social reformer pleading for
change.

Holding a doctorate in politi-
cal science from Columbia, where
he now teaches, Nunez is president
and CEO of the not-for-profit cor-
poration Homes for the Homeless,
which he describes as a “transi-
tional welfare program,” which
operates.out of New York City.

Nunez served in government
for over nine years, worked as the

_ head of public housing for New

York City, and has labored in the
private sector for an additional nine.
He is author of the book Hopes,
Dreams, and Promise: The Future

Dr. Ralph da Costa Nunez
discusses homelessness

What is the basic difference be-
tween what your program is try-
ing to do and what the private
sector is doing now?

We're looking to give people not
just independent housing, but to
make them independent of assis-
tance.

Where do you place the blame for
the current state? Is it the Reagan
policy?

Yep.

So it’s the fault of the Republican
party?

I wouldn’t blame the Republican -

party. I would blame Ronald
Reagan personally, because he sent
the message that did this.
Last fall, when a massive number
of Republicans were elected to
office, what was your first reac-
tion?

It wasn’t negative. I said, “This is
good. It’s time to look at the other
side of the equation. It’s time to
break the stalemate.”

Some might say your message is
liberalin goal, but conservative in
approach. Do you agree?

Everybody says it’s conservative
in approach, but I don’t think it’s
liberal in goal. I think it’s logical in
goal. We all want everyone off
public assitance, we all want to
reduce dependency, but we have to
take a hard right turn to do this.
Are you a Democrat or a Repub-
lican?

I am a New Democrat; I am a
moderate. I’ve spent a lot of time
working with the Bush adminis-
tration, and I’ve spent time with
this administration.

What in your life has caused you
to become involved in the
homelessness issue?
Seventy-five percent of the home-
less in this country are kids, and
there’s no reason to leave children
in this state of poverty — it’s not
such a hard thing to change.
What personal things?

It’s three elements. First, I teach at
Columbia, so I understand there’s
a need for public policy on this

issue, and I know what that public
policy needs to be. I’ve spent nine
years in government dealing with
issues on kids and the homeless
issue in a very big way in New
York City, I know what govern:
ment can and cannot do. And I’ve
spent nine years in the non-profit
sector, and I know what the non-
profit sector should do.

Did working in government frus-

trate you? Did you become very |

dissallusinoed?

No, not at all. It encouraged me.
You see that there is opportunity
Sor government to be productive?
Absolutely.

You don’t think beareaucracy
stands in the way?

There’s beauracracy, but you know
what? You can go right around it.
It doesn’t have to stand in the way.
After 18 years in a “war” which
some would say has made little or
no difference, to what do you owe
your optimistic attitude?

I’ve seen the difference. I’ve seen
things work. I’ve seen things fail,
but I’ve seen many more be suc-
cessful. I know that there is oppor-
tunity. :

Are there any special images that
you can remember that motivate
you?

Whenever I see a class of young
mothers graduate in their caps and
gowns, whenever I see, suddenly,
the “I can do it!” look in their face.
Do you get emotionally involved
in your work?

Nope. I stay a step above so I can
always make the right decisions. I
“vicariously” experience it. When
I read that a thousand kids went to
summer camps, when I read that
eight mothers started junior col-
lege, or that we put this year 400
mothers to work, that’s my reward.
Do you ever get discouraged?
Nope. If you lose optimism, you
lose the vision. If you lose the
vision, you lose the pie.

How do you counteract the apa-
thy that you say.is so prevelant?
I tell them what the issue is: it’s a

of Homeless Children in America.

His message focused on what
he termed “the fastest growing seg-
ment of the homeless population:
families.”

According to Nunez, the pro-
file of the average homeless fam-
ily has changed from what it was
ten years ago: a35-year old mother
with two to three adolescents and
work experience.

Today’s family is led by a 19-
year old unwed mother with two
young children and a sixth grade
education.

The presence of such families
on the streets has risen 100 percent
in the last decade, said Nunez.

Labeling it the “biggest pub-
lic policy mistake in America,”
Nunez asserted that homelessness
is not a housing issue, but rather an
educational one.

He called for “residential edu-
cation employment training cen-

_ ters,” which would replace the tra-

ditional shelter as a residential en-
vironment where parents would
learn the skills needed to raise chil-

dren and the values, education, and-

experience necessary to join the
work force.

His plan would be funded pri-
marily by the federal government,
with some assistance from the pri-
vate sector. Large “campuses”
would be established to house the
homeless families, who, he claims,
would be self-sufficient roughly
two years after entry.

He estimates the cost as
$25,000 per family per year, al-
most double $13,000, which is the
average cost of assistance given
today to an unwed mother fitting
Nunez’s profile.

Dr. Ralph da Costa Nunez spoke in the 900 Roomlast Wednesday.

children’s issue. Nobody in this
country is interested in having kids
on the street. Nobody’s interested
in having kids grow up only to end
up in jail. They [people] have to
shown the face of the issue.
Some would describe Davidson
as “very conservative,” almost
complacent. What would you say
to students like us in a small com-
munity, who come from upper-
middle class homes, who don’t
touch the problem?

You’re. going to touch this prob-
lem. You’re going to touch this
problem indirectly. If you don’t
work with these kids today, you’ re
going to pay for them tomorrow:
you’ re going to pay forjails; you’re
going to pay for health care facili-
ties; you’re going pay for mental
health facilities; you’re going to
pay for all kinds of poverty pay-
ments.

So whether or not you touch
it, whether or not you see them and
work with them now, you better
realize that, directly or indirectly,
they are going to have an effect on
your life.

ges war on poverty

He justified the cost, stating
the level of services needed is much
higher than that currently given.

Nunez criticized proposed leg-
islation which he feels would re-
move the “safety net’ of public
assistance and force even more
people into poverty.

Blaming President Reagan as
the man responsible for the current
state, he urged listeners to vote
carefully in the coming years.

After 35 minutes, Nunez an-
swered questions for an additional
half hour.

Nunez left listeners with a
strong call to action: ““You’re go-
ing to have to fix it,” he said di-
rectly to students.

“Without full commitment,
the war is destined to be lost... .
There is a moment of opportunity,
but it’s now!”
