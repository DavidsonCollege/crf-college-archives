Thanks, President Martin

The day they named D. Grier Mar-
ten president of Davidson College he
came up with one of those statements
that mark a man for what he really is.

“T couldn't believe they weren't
crazy,” he said. ;

President Martin is that kind of
man. Humility more than anything
else has characterized his 10 years in
the college’s hottest seat.

When they offered him the job,
Martin said he would turn it down if
it wasn’t for the fact that he felt that
he had the support of the whole col-
lege community. He would have, too.

It’s just lucky for Davidson that he
didn’t. For in the last 10 years the
college has grown in stature, slowly

Look-Alikes

There may be no other place in the
world like Davidson, but there is a col-
lege in Ohio that shares a few of our
distinctive features.

The College of Wooster is small.
relatively isolated, and Presbyterian
related, and up until a few weeks ago
it was hunting for a new president.

Wooster had a trustee committee
conducting the search just like us,
with a student committee something
akin to ours helping out. Trouble was,
when the new man was finally named,
he wasn’t the one that the student
group had recommended, unanimous-
ly.

‘The students were coldly ignored
by the trustees.” said one Wooster
student we know. “It was a mere ex-
ercise in student futility.”

Thank goodness Davidson is not
going to be like Wooster in that re-
spect. Or is. it?

at first, recently by modest leaps and
bounds. The endowment is up, the
physical plant is up, faculty salaries
are up, a new curriculum is in, and a
new code of responsibility is on the
way. }

Yet the man who is probably most
responsible for it says he really didn’t
have all that much to do with it after
all.

The rest of us know different. Ad-
mittedly, President Martin was-cast by
necessity into the role of money-raiser,
a role that often kept him away from
the college and its day-by-day prob-
lems and triumphs. But it is to his
credit that even though he was some-
times removed from the scene, he had
the wisdom to name able, progressive
stand-ins.

Since he announced his retirement
last winter, editorial writers all over.
the South have praised him for his
contributions to Davidson and higher
education. We won’t try to match
them.

We can judge him, however, from a
standpoint that no other editorial writ-
er possesses—that of the student—and
from that standpoint, too, President
Martin rates mighty high.

For if President Martin has been
anything, he has been a friend of the
student. For 10 years he has kept an
ear open to their complaints and an
eye open for their well-being. It’s no
wonder that practically every student
who has gone through Davidson has
felt a kind of closeness to him.

We only regret that President Mar-
tin will not be president for another
10 years. If the next president is haif
the friend and gentleman D. Grier
Martin is, we will consider ourselves
unusually fortunate. :

Spartans Or Students?

The open dorm experiment last
weekend may have drawn a disap-
pointing number of female guests, but
if for no other reason than the faculty
members it attracted it should be
rated a success.

Actually, not. that ™- -v professors
showed up either, F those that
did, there was the ci. for a good
look at two of the college’s dorms,
from the inside. For at least one or
two faculty members, it was a first.

By and large, Davidson professors
do not know what is inside Dormitory
Row. One professor who has been
here for years said his visit to Richard-
son last Saturday was the first time
he had ever been inside one.

We just wish that he would step
over and take a gander at the inside
of one or two of the other student liv-
ing quarters. We think he might be
surprised and not a little bit disap-

Walter Seeks Answers;

pointed and disgusted at what he
would see.

The dorms here are lousy. The three
freshman dorms, built in the 1920's
but appearing straight out of the last
century, are enough to make any ar-
riving freshman want to pack up and
go home. And the others, despite their
relative youth, aren’t much better.

The rooms are bleak, the lighting
poor and the bathing facilities: inade-
quate. The only thing those long halls

* ,are good for are hall soccer and fris-

bee throwing. It’s as if the architects
thought they were designing the build-
ings for Spartans, not students.

Maybe if some more faculty mem-
bers would come and take a look at
what we are living in they would be
startled enough to join us in a plea
for new dorms or at least some reno-
vation.

ONE LAST SHOT.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Approach To Richardson Scholars
Should Be Flexible,

To The Editor:

Since virtually all the rest
of the Richardson Scholars
already have expressed their
views on the foreign stu-
dents’ program in a joint
letter to the editor, I should
like to make known some of
my personal experiences
and opinions.

There is a genuine agree-
ment between the Richard-
son Scholars that the finan.
cial conditions of the pro-
gram are extremely favor-
able. What the majority of
the group seems to be con-
cerned about, is the acade-
mic aspect. Let me suggest
that the dissatisfactions that
eccur, may be due more to
unrealistic expectations on
the part of individual stu-
dents than to any shortcom-
ings on the part of the pro.
gram.

Personally I came _ here
with the expectation of find-
ing, not a European-type
university, but an American
college, with all its compara.
tive advantages. My expec-
tations were great, and it is
a pleasure to me to assure
that they have all been met.
It has been an invaluable

experience for me to get
away from the one-sided
university-studying I have
been used to, and partici-
pate in a liberal arts -pro-
gram, with opportunity of
widening my range of know-
ledge and interests. This.
apart from the thrill of liv-
ing in a new and unexplor
ed environment, is what. I
want to cite as my most re-
warding experience.

As for the academic re-
quirements for foreign stu-
dents, they are as flexible
as one could reasonably, ex-
pect. The only regulation is
that we have to choose one
course in some way pertain-
ing to American culture, a
fair enough requirement.
presuming that we are all
motivated to learn about
America. Apart from this
one limitation, we are at our
complete liberty to choose
the courses we want and
how we conduct our studies.

I- would like to make a
few specific comments on
last week's letter from my
fellow Richradson Scholars.
They make the contention
that they were not informed

of what would be expected -

of them in the classroom.

Personally I received a col-
lege catalogue and a stack
of documents. where on at
least two different sheets I
found reference to the parti-
cular regulations concerning
class attendance etc., fol-
lowed by the statement:
“All foreign students are ex-
pected to conform in good
spirit to these regulations.”
I find it hard to believe that
I was the only one who re-
ceived this information .

Finally, the 11 Richrdson
Scholars call for ‘‘a greater
opportunity for the indivi-
dual students to use their
cultures to diversify the aca-
demic environment.” I. am
sure the intention is good.
but the authors of the state-
ment do not seem to realize
that. if we do not today di-
versify the academic environ-
ment, we are to blame. We
participate in classes, eat in
freternities, all student acti-
vities are open to us. The
opportunties are there, the
rest is left up to us - and to
coming years’ foreign stu.
dents.

ROTC Logic Riles Chandler

To The Editor:

Mr. Uamil has clearly
stated his defense of requir
ed and voluntary ROTC in
his letter in last week's
DAVIDSONIAN. I think his
defense is sincere, but I can-
not accept it.

| Davidson Provides Few

ED. NOTE: This is the
last of three articles by peo-
ple who are leaving David-
son. The writer this week is
presently completing his
freshman year.

By JOHN WALTER

I am leaving Davidson
College at the end of this
school year, and I have

more than once been ques-
tioned as to the reasons be-
hind my decision.

Indeed, a highly qualified
faculty, a favorable student-
to-faculty ratio, an impres-
sive record of alumni
achievements, and a friend-
ly atmosphere seem to quali:
fy Davidson College as the
ideal liberal arts institution.
However, the question which
lies at the heart of my de-
cision to leave is whether
the college adequately pre-

pares a student for the not-so- |

ideal world which he must
face immediately after
graduation.

One factor to Davidson's
credit is that there is little
threat of interference in
one’s academic pursuits.
The student who knows what
he wants from life and what
he expects to put into it does
find himself in an ideal sit-
uation. He is limited here,

then, only by his personal
motivation.

Yet, what happens to the
average student who has not
yet formulated his own set
of values and his future
plans? An institution should
offer more than an academic
education. Davidson's stated
goal is to “develop men of
humane instincts.'" However.
if I were to graduate with
such an attitude. I would
want to know why or how.

Davidson, for me, has not
provided the answers. For
example, an education
should offer the student a
personal (not merely acade-
mic .or historical) under-
standing of the religion that
was thrown at him long ago.
I do not feel that 1 could
even begin to cultivate this
understanding at an_ insti-
tution so isolated from a re-
presentative humanity. This
aspect of education cannot
be found in the classroom,
nor on a plot of land inhabit-
ed by one thousand males of
similar backgrounds.

My solution to this pro-
blem, although I may prove
myself wrong, is the well-
known
“education factory,’ Ohio
State University, a city of

JOHN WALTER
.~.. Mo regrets, but...

42,000 students represent-
ing countless backgrounds,
is my choice. ,

Granted that each student
is treated as a number by
the administration and that
many of these numbers
perish without ever being
noticed, but the university
promises a diversity and in-
security that the mature
student needs. It provides
an atmosphere that can be
as stimulating as it is de-
pressing.

True, there isn't the

friendly atmosphere and one
may feel overwhelmed by
humanity, but is this not
characteristic of life? Is it
not better to experience this
insecurity now, so that with
a true education-real-world
as well as academic we can
more realistically seek the
answers we all look for?

I believe this course of ac-
tion makes more sense, and
therefore I have chosen the
‘education factory’’ over the
‘ideal’ liberal arts college.

Let me say, in conclusion,
that I do not regret at all
my year at Davidson, for it
has helped me bring into
sharper focus my life’s goals
and the manner in which I
hope to achieve them. Fur-
thermore. I do not intend
this letter as a recommenda-
tion to other students, for as
{ have said previously, the
man who knows where he
fs headed is limited at Da.
vidson only by his own abili-
ties. For those individuals.
Davidson is the ideal institu-
tion.

For me, however, only
the broader horizons of a di-
versified education, an atmo-
sphere of varied experiences
and personalities, wil) suf-
fice.

“The Army is based on
the rule of law,"’ Mr. Hamil
says. This is not true. The
Army is oased on the rule
of rank: that is, soldiers
obey the orders of their of-
ficial superiors and order
their official inferiors. There
are few exceptions to this
tule. -

Mr, Hamil'’s logic is as
faulty as most of his pre-
mises. “I think one’s atten-
dance in ROTC can help
crystalize such important
ideas as the use of force in
the solution of problems.” I
suppose he would argue that
every underclassman at Da-
vidson should spend one day
a week in the county jail
to help crystalize his ideas
about the prison system and

the morality of solitary con-
finement and hard labor.

Mr. Hamil has not shown
the place of ROTC in a li-
beral arts college and he has
not countered the argu-
ments of the ROTC program's
critics. But he has brought
up the best argument
I have ever found for abo-
lishing the ROTC program
at Davidson: “. . . most of
those entering it (ROTC)
are attempting to escape
something.” It disgusts “me.
to think that Davidson Col-
lege can sponsor a program
whose primary appeal to the
student body is taking the
easy way out.

Scholarship No-Car Rule
Lampooned By Simmons

To The Editor:

It is becoming increasing-
ly apparent that students on
scholarship will not be able
to have a car on campus
next year. Not being on
scholarship myself, I feel
that I can offer an objective
appraisal of this situation.
1 fully agree with the scho-
larship committee's deci-
sion, in fact, I think that
they should go further. I be-
lieve that students on scho-
larship should be required to
buy clothes from J. C. Pen.
ny’s or Sear's Bargain Base-
ment. They should be given
a strictly regulated allow-
ance by the college to spend
on luxuries such as soap,
toothpaste, records, stamps,
ete., etc.

I have learned that the
scholarship committee is
considering alternate met.
hods of ‘transportation for

scholarship students. Realiz-
ing that there are those who
will always oppose any vi-
gorous, creative venture like
this I would like to make
several alternate solutions
myself: 1) a subway could
be installed from Davidson
to Queens with scholarship
students getting reduced
rates. Perhaps our token Ne-
gro could be the driver. 2)
a moving sidewalk from Da-
vidson to Queens — perhaps
a little more expensive but
more scenic. 3) a “boycott of
Hood Norton's Barber Shop.
When the rednecks from
Charlotte (Hurt’s Rent-A-Ru-
be) come to support Hood,
our scholarship boys will
have more opportunities to
hitch-hike rides into Char-
lotte.

Greg Simmons ‘69

Says German

To The Editor:

“Agreeing with Skagestad.,
he (Dr. Kelton) said that ac-
ademic requirements for ‘a
Richardson Scholar are flex-
ible.” (From: “Foreign Stu-
dents To -Give Suggestions
In Assembly.” THE: DA-
VIDSONIAN, Friday, May
10, 1968).

I can only agree with Dr.
Kelton and Finn Peter Ska-
gestad if I explicate the
terms ‘academic’ and
“flexible” in a certain way.
It is true that a Richardson
Scholar has to fulfill only
two requirements when he
selects his courses. We had
to take four courses per
semester: one of the alto-
gether eight classes had to
have some relationship with
American history, politics
or culture. Having met these
requirements we could prac-
tically choose among all the
courses offered.

But the Richardson Scho-
lar is nevertheless academi-
cally confined. His academic
background is very different
from that of his classmates,
and his academic future will
also be another.

To him “ academic”
means fitting somehow ad-
vantageously into his own
education. What is academic
to the American Davidson
student is not necessarily
academic for him.

Davidson College is a good
school. For some there
might even be evidence that
it is hard to improve the col-
lege for the American stu-
dent, but I think it is easy
to improve Davidson for the
foreign student.

Post

By BOB REID

Only this, 1 think, can
make the academic (in the
student's sense) really flex-
ible. Being in a foreign
country and having conver- |
sations with a type of peo-
ple one has never met be-
fore is-bound to awake new
interests, interests that
make one want to read ma-
terial which will be assign-
ed ity no course.

If ‘academic’ means
“that which furthers educa-
tion,” he has been confined
more than necessary. The
system was less flexible
than possible.

A. pass/fail-scheme will
do. Two graded courses will
also do.

Why no auditing of
courses with checking of at-
tendance? This way, ‘I feel,
the Richardson Scholar is al-
so academically better off.
For those who want to con-
tinue their education in the
United States and will be
able to transfer their grades
no change is necessary, of .
course.

I would like to add that
this is by no means a per-
sonal complaint. I was lucky
to find professors who kind-
ly made it possible for me
to combine at least to some
extent classwork with what
I felt I should do for my fu-
ture academic career. But
those were personal arrange-
ments. Why not take and ex-
tend the philosophy behind
these and make it the offi- .
cial policy?

The Passing Of An Era

When the last teary-eyed senior leaves the stage
at graduation, Davidson College will have lost more
than another class. It will have seen the close of an
era.

Fewer than half the student body can remember
the days of compulsory vespers and the Sunday night
rush to Mary’s, the days when chapel was really held
three days a week, when fraternities really controlled
the social life of Davidson.

And, of course, the college is losing more than this:
an able and respected president, other members of the
administration, the old calendar and curriculum.

But the change is deeper than this. It involves a
change in attitude and perspective on life. During the
1964 election, the student body here held a mock
election. The winner? Barry Goldwater.

Then a few weeks ago, Time Magazine held its na-
tionwide mock election. And the winner at Davidson?
Eugene McCarthy. What was even more amazing was
the results in the voting by issues. An overwhelming
percentage favored de-escalation in Vietnam. Only a
handful (41) favored riot control as the primary solu-.
tion of the urban crisis.

The wonder in all this is whether or not this change
of heart is genuine. Are Davidson students really more
liberal, or have they decided that liberalism is now the
vogue?

I don’t think so. The success of the boycott, I
believe, proved this. When Davidson students actually
went out of their way to avoid patronizing Ralph John-
son, they demonstrated that they were honest in their
convictions. Davidson has truly seen the passing of an .
era.
