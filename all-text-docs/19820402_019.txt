Once upon a time there was a bass
player named Tina Weymouth and a
drummer named Chris Frantz. They
played in a band called Talking
Heads. Then this rhythmic couple de-

their friends, and with Tina’s sisters

of the Tom Tom Club, and the album

students shot up the soul charts short-

Beyond the realm of credibility? Nah.
Just wait until you hear the record.

est lyrics in a truly ingenuous manner.

Probably the most interesting, and
certainly the most commercially suc-
cessful song on the LP is the relaxed
but bouncy “Genius of Love.” In re-
sponse to the question “Whatcha gon-
na do when you get out of jail?”
comes-the hip but awkward voice pro-
claiming “I’m gonna have some fun.”

- “What do you consider fun?” “Fun,
natural fun.” The lead singer com-
bines the innocent knkowledge of De-
bra Harry with the breathy coolness of
the leader of the Chirelles: The song
then progresses to a catalogue of soul
stars. (Bootsy Collins, Kurtis Blow,
Bohannon, Bob Marley, etc.). The
song has one line which epitomizes
the feeling throughout.the album —
“Who needs to think when your feet
just.go?”

The lyrical singing and very smooth
playing, is, complemented by, a spa-
cious production sound. This aspect
of the recording emphasizes the light-

ness of the album, and is evocative of ©

summer, even though the LP was re-
leased last winter. The songs are
breezy without being flippant, and:
smooth without being slick. Thus de-
