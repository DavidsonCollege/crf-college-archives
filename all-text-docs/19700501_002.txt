Nixon On Draft

It would be absurd to think injus-
tice is mitigated when spread abroad
equally, and such was the initial re-
action to President Nixon’s executive
order ending the granting of occupa-
tional and (if congress approves) stu-
dent deferments.

But certain effects of the Presi-
dent’s action deserve commendation.

For one thing the President has
acted to eliminate an artificial moti-
vation for seekirlg higher education
through his removal of colleges and
universities as sanctuaries of protec-
tion from the draft. The result will
probably mean a pause in the rise of
college enrollment, if not a drop off.
(But graduate schools did survive the
ending of graduate deferments, so it
is likely the effect will not be too se-
vere on undergraduate institutions.)

It is indeed unfortunate that the
plan submitted to Congress would
still allow student deferments to those
committed to taking ROTC. While a
core of “civilian” college-educated of-
ficers helps keep the Army bearable,
students should not be forced into
ROTC as the only means of avoiding
the .draft. .

One af the most ‘unjustified ex-
emptions is that remaining-for min-
isters and ministerial students. We

Out of all the smoke and confusion
of the open meeting between stu-
dents and members of the faculty and
administration, several issues emerged
in much clearer form than they had
before.

Most dramatically there was the is-
sue of graduation credit for work done
in the 1968 summer session. Both
sides in the dispute had valid points
to make.

On behalf of the administration. it
must be admitted that the rules say-
ing that no such credit would be given
were to be found in material avail-
able at the time.

The problem would have been in
putting all the rules together. One
Tule says that a student with 58-72
semester hours of credit at the end
of the summer would need 16 courses
for graduation. A second rule says
that summer school work would count
in terms of semester hours. Thus a
student could do extra work (but not
exceeding the 72-hour Iimit)~and still
need the same amount of courses to
graduate as before.

On behalf of the students, howev-
er. it must be said that the rules were
not stated in conjunction thus making
the correlation not as obvious as it
might seem.

Furthermore there was a rule which

wonder Why the President did not
strike down this well-known but legal

@Rratt dodge along with the other oc-

cupational-educational deferments. It
seems clear that non-religious moral
objections to war should have as much
consideration: as religious objections.
It is not clear why the religious ones
are preferred.

Politically, the executive order
seems a bid for support for a volun-
teer army. Assuming the President is
sincere in his opposition to conscrip-
tion in peacetime —an assumption
very few are willing to grant the Pres-
ident—it is only natural to end unfair
ways of avoiding this “presently nec-
essary evil.” :

Perhaps when the college age group,
those in the population who are the
brightest and most opposed to the
draft, are directly confronted, the po-
litical machinery will start to move.
, We do not condone the draft. It is
an unnecessary evil used to fight an
unjust and immoral war. It has little
if any excuse for continuing. But we
also do not condone exemption from
the draft for a select few who are
smarter or better-born than most. We
hope that by the ending of this ex-
emption the President; has struck a
fatal blow at the peacetime draft.

Out Of The Haze

said that transfer credits would in the
future be counted as 3.3 semester
hours equalling one Davidson course.
It would have been easy to confuse

- this rule as having applied to the sum-
mer session in 1968.

Two faculty members admitted that
they may have made this inaccurate
assumption at the time. A question
also exists as to whether the complete
rules or merely a summary were dis-
tributed to the students.

Thus it seenis quite clear that sig-
nificant doubt about the problems ex-
ists—enough doubt to warrant a fa-
vorable reconsideration of the student
cases involved by the Curriculum Re
quirements Committee (CRC).

If the aims of education are to be
furthered it must be realized that the
students involved felt that their edu-
cation would be enhanced by an op-
portunity to graduate early. While it
may be too late to help members of
the class of 1970 at all, prompt action
might still significantly benefit those
present rising seniors who were in-
volved.

A further point to come out of the
meeting was that students could ben-
efit the CRC by their presence on that
committee. Students would be able to
help faculty members become fully
aware of the concerns involved when
grievances come before the CRC.

Fee For All

“Justice delayed is justice denied,”
the English used to say. This aphor-
ism appears to be singularly applic-
able to the College’s handling of a
current laundry fee dispute.

The College has a rule stating that
every student is required to pay a
laundry fee—currently amounting to
$110 per year—unless he has been ex-
cused by the Dean of Students. It
seems that a trio of students who are
presently living off campus felt such
an excuse to be implicit in a Septem-
ber conversation with the Dean, at
which time permission to room off
campus was granted.

One of the main selling points the
students used in the conversation was
the fact that living off campus would
be cheaper than living on campus, and
the avoidance of the college laundry
fee was specifically. mentioned in this
regard.

However, upon receiving their first
set of college bills in the fall, the stu-
dents discovered that they were being
charged the fee after all.

The students, who in fact have yet
to use the college laundry this year,

B. C.

attempted to meet with the Dean on
several different occasions during the
winter and spring terms, only to-have
him break each appointment. . They
were finally able to see him this
month, at which time they received
a definite ‘‘no’’ answer to their re-
quest to be relieved of the laundry fee
obligation.

The students are carrying their case
to the Court of Appeals.

It hardly seems fair that students
should be forced to maintain an insti-
tution such as the laundry from which
they do not benefit or attempt to ben-
efit. The condition seems even less
fair in the case of a laundry whose
inefficiency and paternalism are a
source of complaints to even on-cam-
pus students. :

But aside from the basic question
of the fairness.of the College rule in
this instance, there exists the disturb-
‘ing feeling that justice can be thwart-
ed by delay. We therefore sincerely
hope that the appeal is taken up a
good deal more quickly than was ‘the
original attempt to petition the Dean
of Students.

Bryan Defends Courts;
Boyd Justifies ROTC :

To the Editor:

I am not absolutely cer-
tain what Mr. McLean was
attempting in his interview
of several members of the
College courts (THE DAVID-
SONIAN, April 17), but what-
ever it was, I fear he failed
most grossly.

If he was attempting to
embarrass * the gentlemen
with whom he conducted his
interview by inappropriate
and almost insolent ques
‘fions such as, “Do you be
lieve that Davidsoh can still
have an efficient ‘commun
ity court’ system?", then he

failed because of their adept
and courteous answers.

The questions McLean has
asked are totally beyond the
purview of any man not sec
ond-sighted. But he received
his answers, if not his pound
of flesh. (Our courts do not
operate that way.)

I fear that Mr. McLean
would have us to believe that
they do, however. At least
he would like us to believe
that. we cannot trust them.

The main thrust of the ar-
ticle was not in the interview
itself, but in the accompany-
ing note. But we will say to
that, that this newspaper
cannot do anything furthér
to damage adjudication at
this college than it has done
already.

It can only serve to re-
mind its readers of a situa-
tion which it created—almost
entirely out of whole cloth.
The events themselves were
quite true, but the interpre-
tation placed upon them was
at once misplaced and mere-
tricious.

If, however, it was Mr.
McLean's purpose to accen-
tuate the need for reform I
must agree. Nonetheless, I
rebuke him still, for, as one
member indicated when. he
entered the court, this is
not a political matter, but

one which: judges must set-

tle themselves.

All we need is some good
will and that is a quantity
strangely lacking in these
supposedly liberal halls.

To the Editor:

It never ceases to amaze
me how individuals who con-
sider themselves ‘'‘liberal”
(i.e., open-minded) can justi-
fy their demands that ROTC
at Davidson must be discon-
tinued.

It is one thing to attack
ROTC because you person-
ally do not agree with its
purpose, or that you think it
is “immoral,” or whatever.
But it is quite another to say

Reporter Raided

To the Editor:

Dear Sir:

In response to’ frequent
questions and comments on
the mural I painted in the
Davidson College Union, I
am: making the . following
statement: There are no

words nor parts of words to
be found in the mural.

Because its content is pure-
lv non-ob‘ective, there are
also no objects included in
the composition.

Any other statements as to
the mural’s content or mean-
Ing are false and have de-
veloped over the last few
years as part of a mythol-
ogy about this painting.

Tl have great affection for
tne painting, and would hope
that in the future new stu-
dents and visitors to the
campus will be allowed to
approach it on their own
terms without being preju-
diced by the present inter-
pretation.

PERcept

By PAUL E. ROWLAND :

The Poripous And The Published

2: ee ee

B. F. Skinner is a megalomartiiac, -of ' sorts.

In Walden Two Dr. Skinner does not claim to be
God, a Kennedy, or even a Nixon; but he does have
delusions of grandeur: he thinks he can write decent
fiction. Lots of people have the same delusion, but
somehow they don’t allow their mistakes into sixteen ,,

printings.

Perhaps Skinner took the same correspondence
course in creative writing as Ayn Rand (of Fountain-

head and Atlas Shrugged fame). If
so, it would be interesting to know
how much they had to pay for pass-

ing grades.

At least Miss Rand’s characters
have features—even though all the
good guys have metallic faces made
of sharply defined angles and all
the bad guys have fat, free-form

figures.

NG
ROWLAND

At least one can see Miss Rand’s characters going
about their mechanica] -motions while Skinner’s ab-
stractions sort of float around doing things such as
‘nodding rapidly.” Now just how does one nod rap-

idly?

The very idea of nodding rapidly just doesn’t be-
come the nature of Frazier, the deus in machina who

guides our narrator
wonderland.

through this 300-page visit to

At least Miss Rand’s books copsain some semblance
of an interesting plot, and where her story is lacking
at-least she manages to throw in a little sex to keep

things interesting.

Skinner’s book can get along without sex—or rath-
er it could have if it had had even a modicum of sus-
pense; you know what will happen from the first pages

of the. thing.

At least Miss Rand’s works are cleverly contrived
so that there are occasional profound ties, but the
only quotable thing Skinner says is. in the vague voice
of Frazier who announces, ‘You can hear my mind
creak in the pompous cadences of my prose.” ;

(Physician, heal thyself.)

All this leads me to groan, ‘‘Why did the greatest
psychologist of the century write something so aw-

ful?”

“To suggest a utopian society based-on his analysis
of behavior,’ the naive answer. But if that was the
intention why not publish a straightforward essay set-
ting down his recommendations?

Profit motive, perhaps? That hardly seems likely
since the excellence of his nonfictional works makes
all his writings “must reading” for anyone interested

in current psychology.

Of course, without the novel form Skinner would
have missed the pleasure of setting up Professor Cas-
‘tle as the all-purpose straw man to be cast as dogma-
tist, reactionary, and chauvinist; but was such an ob-
vious, vindictive maneuver worthy of a respected.
psychologist’s treatise on utopia?

Should Dr. Skinner, or you, gentle reader, care to
write Walden Three, I highly recommend the prologue
to Don Quixote which not only exposes Skinne’s pomp-
ous ploy of numereus literary and music allusion, but
also presents the goal of anyone who would write to
communicate rather than just to publish.

Erupts Into

Controversy Over Cups

To the Editor:

On Earth Day observ-
ances at Davidson were
small and undemonstrative,
and only one of them seem-
ed to move people at all.
Some members of ECOS
distributed one paper cup
at each meal to everyone
who ate in the Union,

‘ The goals of this small
exercise were to make peo-
ple aware that it was Earth
Day, and to show them that
they needed only one cup
per meal. Normally the
Union uses plastic cups and
normally almost 3000 are
consumed per day. On April
22 only 1100 cups were con-
sumed and they were paper.

The cafeteria and“its daily
functioning offer us an ex-
cellent example of a small
and common problem of
solid waste disposal.

These were two aspects
to the problems of the cups
after we accept the fact
that it is much cheaper for
the Union to use the cups

‘because of the great scar-

city of dishwashers.

One aspect was the sub-
stance of which the cup was
composed—plastic, and plas-
tic is forever. It simply will
not decay.

The other aspect was or
is the amount of consump-
tion. No matter what
kind of cup you use, the
voracious Davidson student
will consume four of it—and
the consequent volume of
things you’ have to dispose
of becomes frightening.

The Union will begin us-
ing paper cups shortly. The
problem is far from solu-
tion, and the students who
complained about the ex-

‘ercise on April 22 showed

this vividly.

At breakfast one  fresh-

man bitched because he
had to interrupt his feed-
ing to walk the ten feet to
the milk dispenser to refill
his cup.

Dan Johnston complained
on the Wailing Wall because
the individual was not given
the right to choose to take
one cup and because he had
to drink coke in the same
cup from which he had
drunk milk. The freshman's
case is obvious — walking
ten feet is better than con-

* suming an extra. cup need-
lessly. It is no inconvenience

, to use only one cup and

“his irritation showed very
simply that he is spoiled.
Dan's case is more subtle.
He is certainly «correct in
objecting to forced limita-
tion of consumption. This
does nothing but anger peo-
ple. Control must come
from within.

But for this one day we
had to make our Point and
the most effective way to
do it was the way we did it.
Some people have stopped
using so many’ cups, but
there are still those who
use four and five at every
meal. ‘A simple sign would
not have sufficed to call the
problem to their attention.

Another speciously legiti-
mate Sripe against the ex-
ercise was that it was too
narrow. The “real'’ pollut-
ers are big business and in-
dustry. oe is basically
true—but not fully. The real
Polluters are mindless con-
sumers,

The enormous problems
must be solved at higher
levels, but there are a great
many problems which are
no more spectacular and no
more complex than the one
with the Union and the cups?

People care too much about’
petty and demeaning | con-

~veniences — the kinds

plastic cups and disposable
containers (which aren't
really disposable) offer. It
is consumption without
thought of the conse-
quences, Certainly packag-
ing methods will have to
change, but until then, we
must voluntarily limit our
consumption,

One other thing that was
dismaying was the number
of people watching the CBS
special on the environment
at 10:00 that night—zero.
The TVs in the lounges of
Belk, Watts, Little, East and
Cannon were all tuned to
stupid pablum shows.

People just don't
enough to inform

care
them-

. Selves. It's sad and frighten--

To the Editor:

This letter is ‘to cast..an
affirmative vote for the idea
of Earth Day. Pollution is
an imminent danger and rec-
ognition of the problem is
long overdue. '

However, as a great Ger-
man philosopher said, ‘‘No
man must have to.” I refer of
course to the militant ecol-
ogists in the cafeteria who
rationed drinking cups at
meals on April 22.

IT say “militant” because
of the forced’ participation.
required of students eating
at the Union. Forced partic-
ipation is abhorrent (remem-
ber required chapel, upper-
classmen?),

Accordingly, I must pro-
test the tactics employed by
the junior ecologists of Da-
vidson College.
