For seniors Roger Farabee,
John Jackson, Jimmy Prappas,
and Carol Robinson, the wait-
ing and hoping has just begun.
The four were selected last week
to represent Davidson in na-
tional competition for the pres-
tigious Thomas J. Watson Fel-
lowships. .

The fellowships, which carry
a stipend of $8,000, are desig-
ned to allow college graduates
“of unusual promise” to travel
abroad for a year studying a
project of their own choosing.
Although the scope of possible
projects is almost limitless,
they must be “‘realistic, imagin-
ative, and personally signifi-
cant.” This year’s four no-

minees, narrowed from a group
of seventeen by the. Graduate
Fellowships Committee, de-
scribed their proposals this
week.

Farabee, a Music major,
hopes to become an apprentice

to organ maker and restorer
Jacques Steinkens in Zeist,
Holland, who does ‘more re-
storation of quality than anyone
else in the world.’ He will study

~the design and construction of

antique pipes with Steinkens
and then tour Germany, Fran-
ce, Italy, and Spain, viewing
other antique organs and com-
paring their design with that of
organs in Holland and the
United States.

Farabee explained that there
are many different types of
-organs, each built to be used for
a particular type of music. But
in the United States, Farabee
said, ‘‘We try and play it all on
one organ. Instead, we need to
understand the organ that the
music was written for and the’
limitations of the particular
instrument.’’ He hopes to con-
struct an organ that will play a
fairly wide range of music while
still maintaining quality crafts-
manship.

Prappas wants to study the

effects of the 1974 Cyprus coup
which left 200,000 refugees on
that island displaced. Prior to
the coup, Cyprus had been a
“united republic; now it is a
federated state with two gov-
ernments--one Turkish and one
Greek. In addition to inter-
viewing government and mili-
tary officials about how an equi-
table settlement may be rea-
ched, Prappas plans to spend
time in both representative
Greek and Turkish Cypriot
villages, to see ‘‘how they com-
pare on a human scale and how
whatever settlement is reached
may affect them.”

Prappas, an American Stu-_

dies major in the Center for
Special Studies, speaks Greek
and plans to learn Turkish so
that he will be able to talk to
knowledgeable people in Lon-
don, Brussels (NATO head-
quarters), Athens, and Ankara,
Turkey. He said that the Cy-
‘priot situation is a ‘‘current
“topic’’ and pointed out that
since the downfall of Iran,
Cyprus has taken on increasing
significance as a strategic mili-
tary base. Also, both Greece
and Turkey have a vested
interest in the outcome because

both are members of NATO.”

A third proposal comes from
Robinson, who plans to study
therapeutic and rehabilitative
programs for children with neu-
rological problems at. the Max
Planck Institute in Munich. She
believes ‘there is a vast amount
about sach problems which is
unknown and many areas where
little work has been done.”
_ Robinson is interested in a

concept that she said is not

given much attention in the
United States today—that the

such a hypothesis should prove

Jackson hopes to divide his
time equally between the three
countries, studying the differ-
ent options open to govern-
ments, and then determining
which plan or combination of
plans would werk best in the
United States. He plans to go
into legal aid and public defense

currently studying neurophy-
siology in the Center for Special
Studies, hopes to visit other
research centers in England,
Switzerland, France, and Italy.
She eventually hopes to use her
biological research to help chil-
dren with specific problems.

Jackson, a psychology major,
hopes to visit England, Ireland,
and Norway to examine their
legal aid systems for the poor.
Jackson described the different
governmental programs offer-
ed. “In England, private indivi-
duals and firms are paid by the
government to provide free
legal counsel. In Ireland, the
government hires lawyers who
work full-time with legal aid
services and have no private
practice. And ‘Norway uses a

ships is an interview with

and Dean of Students Will
Terry commented on this year's
nominees, saying, “We're very
pleased and believe their pro-
jects and personalities will

All four have said they are

their chances. In the words of
Prappas, ‘I feel good, but it's
crazy to think you're going to

ODK gives seniors chance

to practice interviews

By JEAN SORACCO
Features Editor

For many students the
thought of an interview ‘is
terrifying. The Omicron Delta
Kappa Circle of Davidson,
which recognizes leaders in
various sectors of campus life,
has planned an interviewing
program as a free service to
students.

One reason for planning the
project is to make ODK a more
active group on campus. The
most important reason though
said Andy Miller, President of
Davidson’s ODK Circle, is to
give students who aren't in-
volved in the pre-med and

pre-law programs experience in
an interview situation.

ODK is setting up the mech-

- anics of the interviews. Each
person who signs up will have
two interviews during the three
weeks between Thanksgiving
and Christmas. Each inter-
viewing Committee will have a
faculty member, a student who
is a member of ODK, and a
townsperson or staff person of
the college.

The interviews will last twen-
ty minutes with a ten minute
evaluation at the end. Present
at each interview will be a
qualified evaluator such as Ken
Wood and N.C. Fellows who are
trained in observing-and giving
feedback. -:

An evaluation sheet will be
given to the student. Hopefully
the tips the student réceives in
his first interview will improve
the student's performance in
the second interview.

Only seniors wil] be able to
participate in this trial pro-
gram. If it is sucessful, the
ODK will repeat the program in
the spring for juniors and
sophomores.

Interested students should
sign up before the end of fall

” term. The only prerequisite is

that each student fill out a
resume listing his experiences °
and giving the committees ideas
on the type of interview to set
up so that it will be a practical
one.

Resumes will be due the
Tuesday after Thanksgiving.
Interviews will be held two
nights a week at the Honors.
Center, and each student will
be notified of his times.

Miller hopes for a lot of
interest in the program so that
the program can become a
practical service for all stu-
dents.
