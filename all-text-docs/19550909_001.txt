DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1955

FRESHMEN EDITION

No Successor Named
Yet By YMCA Board

The Reverend Samuel Hays Ma-
gill, General Secretary for the
Davidson College YMCA during the
past two years, has resigned his
position. His resignation will be
effective sometime before the end
of the calendar year. No successor
has been designated as yet by the
YMCA Board of Directors, but
should one be named soon, Magill’s
resignation will become effective
around November 1.

His future position,

his resignation, Mr. Magill said, “I
am leaving with a great deal of
regret, but I felt that I could not
turn down the new position of-
fered to me.”

Mr. Magill joined the Davidson
YMCA as its General Secretary in
August 1953. Outstanding achieve-
ments during this period at David-
son include the University Chris-
tian Mission and the passing of the
new YMCA constitution which
made membership voluntary. Other
important achievements were the
commissions established to study
Christianity in its relation to the
various fields of life and promote
an intellectual understanding of
Christianity, the setting up of a
summer placement bureau during
his first year at Davidson, and the
increased number of freshman
activities, which included the
YMCA Freshman Council and fel-
lowship groups.

Yale Divinity School conferred
the B.D. degree on Mr. Magjll in
1953. Prior to his study there, he

Grail and the Golden Fleece, hon-
orary leadership societies, elected
him to membership in recognition
of his accomplishments.

Church, and is a native of

Tom Scott Assumes
Athletic Office Duties

Tom Scott has assumed his duties
as Director of Physical Education
and Athletics at Davidson College.

The former University of North
Carolina basketball coach has
moved his family to Davidson from
Chapel Hill. They have been there
since he completed his doctorate
of education requirements at Co-
lumbia University in June.
| Dr. Seott is already working on
ja system of budgeting and policy
for the Davidson athletic depart-
ment and has announced some
plans which appear on Page 3.
| “We shall have a good program

in physical education for all stu-
dents,” he affirms. “And the inter-
collegiate program should be a
part of it for boys who are better
qualified and have more zbility.

“Davidson has a fine staff of
young coaches, and I hope that
we can continue on the same type
of sports schedules that the college
has had.”

A coach himself since 1930, Dr.
Scott will take an active part in
Davidson coaching.

“I plan to help Danny Miller with
basketball and probably coach the
golf team,” he says. “In any other
sports I'll help out any way I can.”

He coached high school sports at
Moundridge and Halstead in Kan-
sas, and was physical education di-
rector for the Morehead, Minn.,

270 Freshmen
Arrive onCampus

Davidson College welcomed the Class of ‘59 to the campus
yesterday. Some 270 freshmen reported for a five-day period of
orientation and registration. The following is an article written by
special request for the Davidsonian by John Child, Freshman
Advisor.

By the time this edition of The Davidsonian comes off
the press the Class of '59 will find itself in the midst of this
much talked about period called “Orientation,” and no doubt,
will feel somewhat overstuffed with endless words of welcome!

This period, by its very nature Becerra 309 bn

has at times tended to become}
rather confusing with its maze of |
activities. Therefore, during |

the past few years, all items of
business which could satisfactorily
be taken up at a later time have |
gradually been eliminated in an)
effort to “streamline” the program
and give it more meaning and di
rection

This fall several new features
have been added to such essential
ones as physicals, tests, and ex-
planations of student life and activ
ties. One of these is the basis on|
which your class is divided into}
its groups. Instead, of alphabetical-

1953, was more than $900,000. This includes completely equipped rooms, lobby, offices, and the
ROTC facilities. With the addition of Belk, the 795 rooms provided by the dormitories will furnish
two-to-a-room housing for almost all students. Davidson thus begins its 119th school year with a building
program that has seen a large part of the college built or replaced in the past 15 years.

dent Counselors and Faculty Coun-
selors in Davidson College’s 1955

students and professors are being
directed in their work by John
Child, Freshman Adviser, and Dr.
Samuel R. Spencer, Dean of Stu-
