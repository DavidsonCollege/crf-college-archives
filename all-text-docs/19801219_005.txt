Cats play well at First Union Tourney

By CRAIG WHITE
Sports Editor

“I’m really pleased with our
play. We’re getting better and
better and we’re. going to be a
team to be reckoned with.”’
With\ these words of praise,
Davidson Coach Eddie Bieden-
back summarized the super-
lative play of the Wildcats who
mildly upset Big Ten Wisconsin
67-63 and fell to 12th ranked
Texas A&M during the First
Union Invitational Tournament
last weekend.

Friday night, against Wis-
consin the key word was
“‘tempo”’ as the Cats played the
type of game they wanted —
a controlled, transition game of
patiently looking for the best
shot possible. At times, David-
son’s guards ran the ball for fast
breaks against the Badgers, an
occurrence not seen since the
Wofford game in late Novem-
ber.

Davidson’s tempo play forcéd
three of the Badger’s starters to
foul out, including Wisconsin’s
all-time fourth leading scorer
Claude Gregory who managed
only two baskets. And although
the Cat’s defense allowed Wis-
consin center Larry Petty a
game-high 25 points; the con-
centration on defense in prac-
tices paid off this past weekend.

A good indication of the Cats’
scrappy yet errorless defense is
the fact that the Badgers only
shot six free throws; in contrast
Davidson’s deliberate offense
allowed the Cats to shoot 29 free
throws, of which 25 were good.

One difference in play this
year has been the ability of the
team to maintain its composure
in pressure situations. Even a
newcomer to major college bas-
ketball, junior transfer Tommy
McConnell -made three crucial
free throws to keep Davidson
ahead in the late going. Free-
throws in pressure situations
was perhaps the determining
factor down the stretch. With
3:17 left and Davidson up by
three, senior forward Todd
Haynes connected on two free
throws while junior Jamie Hall
hit all six of his free throws in
the last minute and a half.

Wrestling season is in full swing.

Todd Haynes was named to
the First Union Invitational all-
star team for his outstanding
shooting and court play.
Haynes racked up a team-high
23 points against Wisconsin.
Earlier this week Haynes was
named Southern Conference
Player of the Week. Perhaps the
most pleasant surprise of the
first game was the consistent
play of 6-5 freshman guard
Kenny Wilson who had several
power moves inside against the
tall Badgers and connected on
six of eight field goals.

After Saturday’s champion-
ship game, Texas A&M Head
coach Shelby Metcalf glowingly
commented, ‘‘This was probab-
ly the best game we've played
this year. I want to compliment
Davidson. I thought they were
a fine group of young men.

That Haynes is a smart ball
player.’”” The Cats needed more
than the team-high 16 points
from Haynes to contend with
12th-ranked A&M’s muscle as
the Aggies cooled: off David-
son’s winning streak 76-62.

A&M’s big man Rudy Woods
had his best game of the year
with 24 points and 10 rebounds.
Davidson just couldn’t penet-
rate the Aggie’s well-tuned
defense as the Cats shot 40%
from the floor. Rebounding over
“The Wall” of Texas A&M’s
front line was also a problem.

Biedenbach added, ‘‘We got
down 10 to 13 points and it was
hard. We’re still searching for
the best and right combination
for certain situations and in cer-
tain games.” If the last two
games are any indication, he’s
getting pretty close.

Davidson defeats UT-C

Davidson withstood a strong
second-half comeback by the
University of Tennessee at
Chattanooga to win 93-84 last
night in Johnston Gym.

The Cats had a 47-25 lead at
halftime but an effective UTC
full-court press combined with
phenomenal offensive perfor-
mance cut the lead all the way
down to 88-81 with 1:45 left in
the game.

The UTC Moccasins’ then
lost their momentum and foul
shots by Davidson’s Ken Wil-
son and Tommy McConnell

clinched the win.

The Mocs’ pressure defense
got them into foul trouble as
three Moc players fouled out
and the team as a whole
committed a whopping 35 fouls.
Davidson converted on 34 of 51
of the resulting free throws. The
UTC press only resulted in 15
Davidson turnovers, most of
which came in the second half.

Todd Haynes led all scorers
with 23 points. Davidson center
Jamie Hall also turned in a
strong performance with 15
points and 13 rebounds.

Richie D. goes in for a shot.

By BAD BERNARD
and BONEHEAD

Yuletidings to you old egg-
noggers. Merry Christmas and
Happy New Year. And now for
the traditional Bad Bernard and
Bonehead Christmas Story.

This year’s story takes place
in the hamlet of Mt. Mourne
with the Hohenzollern family.
Young Cleo Hohenzollern, a
young neuter of age six, was
anxiously anticipating the Mt.
Mourne Fire Department
Christmas party. The Hohen-
zollerns were a poor family and
little Cleo had never been to a
party before, especially a
Christmas one. It was rumored
that there might be gifts for
some of the children.

Young Cleo would lay awake
at night hoping that he might

be one of the select few who’

would receive a shiny new toy.
“Gee whiz, I hope I get some-
thing,’’ Cleo would say to his

- poor father of little income and

few pieces of money.

The big day grew close, and
Cleo the child was very excited.
He got so excited he would
often urinate at night all over
himself. His mother, Beatrice
Hohenzollern, thought the pro-
blem would go away, but she
was wrong; it got much worse.
Now besides not being able to
control his bladder, he often
found himself regurgitating his
meals. One night in particular
he had just finished eating his
Morton’s frozen ravioli TV din-
ner and he got sick all over his

little sister’s freckled face. She
then in turn got sick and threw
up all over the table.

Before the Hohenzollern
parents could stop it there were
large chunks and small chunks
of half-eaten ravioli all over the
place. In between the chunks
there were little lines of saliva
connecting the pieces. You
know those little orange lines
that are so gooey, and if you
follow one of those lines it leads
back to the little girl’s mouth
whence it came.

And then you wonder how
such a pretty girl could barf up
all that stuff, and you know she
did it ‘cause you can still see
some of it on her lips and smell
it on her.

Now think of the last time
you puked all over the place.
Maybe it was in elementary
school on your little desk, or
maybe once after you took
drunk for a couple of days, or
maybe you plan to throw up
tomorrow night. Don’t try to
get out of it, you know you have
tossed your cookies at least
once in the past, everyone has.

But regardless of whether or
not you threw up, your are not
in our Christmas story and little
Cleo, the poor boy, is, .so let’s
get back to him. Young Cleo
survived this tragic episode
only to be killed on the after-
noon of the Christmas party by
his friends who threw little
rocks at him until he died.

There are several morals one
can draw from this story. One,

puking is not that bad; after all,
young Cleo would have rather
thrown up again than be kilt by
his little schoolmates. Two,
don’t get so excited about
Christmas parties; and three, if
you enjoyed this ‘article you are
sick and someone should bite
off your head and puke in your
neck.

And now on with the IMAC
report, we hope you liked our
story. In the B League this past
week there were a pantload of
games. The Green Hornets ran
by the Squat and Leave Its,
61-13, and the Rock ’n Roll
Sunoco pounced on the Beaver
Retrievers, 5-4 in a low scoring
contest.

In other games of merit the
Taints closed in on the Mule
Erection team, but it was too
late as the Mule shot at the
buzzer, 51-50. The Shirts clob-
bered the Skins last Thursday
at 7:30 on court 2, 103-41, and
the Brown Excretions eased
their way past the Anal Sphinc-
ters, in a long one (four over-
times) 88-87.

There were several other
games played but we would
have had to walk all the way
back over to the gym to, get the
scores, and it was cold outside
and all I had on was my Arizona
State sweatshirt, and my cohort
just had on his green flannel
shirt with the hole in the left
sleeve (you know the one).

And now a special feature, a
letter from some of our fans.
