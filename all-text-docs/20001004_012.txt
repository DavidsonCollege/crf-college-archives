Aaron, you ignorant slat How anyone
with one iota of sense could support the left-
wing, Tipper-marrying, gun-banning,
internet-inventing, no-talent hack Al Gore is
beyond me.

- Let’s do a little examination of my major

running around the country with that thing he.
mistook for a girl in a. Gronkes stupor one
night.

And now here comes Gore running around
like a chicken with his head cut off screaming

‘ about how he has all these proposals and

issues with Al
Gore. First in
the line-up?

So, I guess, the stop-and-think exercise

The only reason I éan think of that Al Gore
got hooked up with this girl is that he was
drunk one night at Harvard and went to some
“social club” (or'whatever those uppity folks
call their fraternities) and got cornered by this

Why George W. Bush is a flat out idiot - forces

Once again the time of year has come when
America shows its brightest, truest, and ugli-
est colors. That time of year: election time.
And the front-runner of the freakshow:
George Dubya Bush. I mean, this guy is an
idiot, and he forces our wonderful country to
stoop to his level of
crying and moan-
ing.

Let’s just inves-
tigate the vision of
the utopian
America Dubya
would have us liv-. -
ing in if he were
elected. First of all,
we would all be
brainwashed,
close-minded, ho-
mogeneous conser-
vatives. Those of
us with money and
brains would keep
our money and our
brains, while we cut
our own taxes, stole
from the poor, and
implemented any type of education or social
program that would insure our offspring’s
position in society and our servants’ position
in our kitchens. And don’t worry, those of us
with money and brains wouldn’t be scrub-

body! I’ve got the solution.”

It’s exactly as if Gore were that one moron
who exists in every class here at Davidson.
Picture it. It’s 8:30 in the morning, you’re
recovering from the Thursday night Depot
romp, trying to resist the urge to pass out cold
and that one idiot has got his hand up giving
his unrequested and irrelevant opinion on
something.

You know the people I’m talking about,
and if you don’t then you ARE that guy. Ok,
everyone knows what you’re doing. Don’t
do it. Every professor and every student here
sees right through you. Whatever you thought
was so insightful that you needed to share,
probably isn’t. I know-that it pains me greatly
to hear you speak, and by doing so, you make
the whole class stupider for having listened to
you. ’

bing our own toilets either.

Next, we would certainly find ourselves
shackled by the religious conservatism that
has marked little Georgie’s campaign and has
plagued the Republican Party for years. I’m
sure Mr. John Pitt ’04, who found it so neces-

sary to tell me why |

his vision of amore
lackluster Outpost
would be beneficial
tosociety, would'’be
happy to support
the repression ‘of
any religious ideas
that make us un-
comfortable, justas
Bush would sup-
press those ideas

his ‘own religious
view.

In addition, just
as Mr. Pitt would
limit religious ex-
pression at the Out-
post, so too would
Bush limit an
American’s choice on abortion. Whether or
not it is acceptable, heinous, or unthinkable,
the current pro-choice stance of the govern-
ment is the only option given the founding
ideology of this great nation. America was

1 Gore is a a flat out idiot - candidate lacks “logic: filter”

‘Gore has the same jaoblatn: no logic filter.
Both Gore and the comment-whores fail to
actually assess

workable or not.
And even if, by
some miracle of
God, they stop and
think about what
they are going to
say, they wouldn’t
know the difference
between a deep in-
sight and their
Cliff’ s Notes-esque
mental flatulence.
So, I guess, the stop-
and-think exercise
for them is point-
less anyway. Just
be silent Mr. Gore.

The polls. Oh,
sure they all say that
Gore and Bush are
neck-and-neck. That’s just what the liberal
trash media want you to think. Their polls aré
all misleading and based upon false informa-
tion.

Just like that Princeton Review rating that
says that Davidson students are number one
for studying the hardest. Uh, huh. Right.
Sounds nice doesn’t it.

a wide variety of subjects. We can choose
what television station to watch, what gaso-
line to buy, what candidate to vote for. But
never are we forced to take one course of

Bush’s blatant ignorance of the beauty of our
Constitution and the very strands of freedom
woven in its fabric is simply disgusting.

Really though, the real issue here is one of
intelligence. We can elect a conscious, expe-
rienced statesman in Al Gore, or we can elect
asputtering drug user who slid his way through
college on his father’s name.

So I charge you, the reader, with the moral
and social responsibility of voting for a man
who has the brains, the drive, and the honor to
be president. I.urge you to vote for the
candidate that, unlike many of the class of

stones for rubber bullets.

This argument, though, is susceptible to
debate. It depends on the reader. For this
reason, I admit: rage there is. Israeli troops
have killed fifty-one Palestinians, and that:is
reason enough. Still, there is a lack of objec-
tivity. CNN reported that Israeli security
forces advanced on the rock-throwing pro-

testers, firing rubber-coated steel bullets at
the crowd. The violence stepped up, with.

Molotov cocktails joining the hail of stones
from the Palestinian side.
It is what we expect, so we gloss over it.

‘But rubber-coated steel bullets? That’s .

not a Nerf product. That’s as lethal as live
ammunition. Most people don’t realize that.
I hesitate to draw too strained.a comparison,
but rubber-coated steel bullets are something
akin to the infamous water hoses of the Civil
Rights Movement.
sprayed with water; they were bowled head
over heels down the street.

The crisis has its genesis in a visit to the

Temple Mount by Ariel Sharon, leader of.

Israel’s conservative Likud Party. The Temple

-Mount, known as Haram al-Sharif, the Noble

Sanctuary, to Palestinians and the rest of the
Arab world, includes the Western Wall and
two mosques—al-Aqsa and the Dome of the

‘Rock, Islam’s third holiest site.

The violence erupted shortly after Sharon’s

Protesters were not :

visit. Here’s what he had to say: “T believe
that we can live together with the Palestin-
ians. I came here to the holiest place of the
Jewish people in order to see what happens
here and really to have the feeling of how we
need to move forward. There was no provo-
cation here.”

Noton the surface anyway. Delving deeper,
we must question Sharon’s motives. Why
did he visit the Temple Mount in the first
place?

‘ Why do politicians do anything? Sharon
was trying to solidify support in his election
constituency. The coalition government of
current prime. minister Ehud Barak is un-
stable at best, and the Likud Party is looking
to become the opposition no more;

PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and Pales-
tinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi both
warned against Sharon’s visit, worrying that
it would spark protests. To return to the Civil
Rights Movement analogy, it would be like

_the Imperial Grand Wizard of the KKK tour-

ing the National Civil Rights Museum in full
regalia. Sharon knew what he was doing.
Perhaps he simply did not anticipate the mae:
nitude of the crisis.

Please read critically. The world is a big
place, and most of us (myself included) have

‘seen little and understand less. Just don’t take

this crisis, or anything else, at face value.
