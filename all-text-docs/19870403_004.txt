The 1987 Rusk Scholars have
been in America for four full
weeks, and seem have
quite well. :
The six Britons will be attend-

ing various universities in Eng--

land next year, and are spending
spring term here taking two class-
es apiece pass/fail. All graduated
from British secondary schools

last year and have been on break
since then.

Martin MacConnol noted that
Americans seem to be “bigger and
more fit” than the average British
student. “You also all look so
old.” MacConnol wasn’t doing
much in the way of observing such
American phenomena as he was
being interviewed; he was
simulating being blind for the day
for his psychology class.

Jane Ewbank spent eighth
grade in Washington D.C. as her
mother taught English at Geo-
rgetown University and the Uni-
versity of Maryland, and missed
“corn chips, cherry Lifesavers,
Oreos and American supermar-
kets. In American supermarkets,
everything smells good, is prepac-
kaged, ‘there are six types of ev-
erything,” she said enthusiasti-
cally. “The soft drink aisle goes

- from here to tomorrow.”

Peter Dzendrowskyj admits
that his name isn’t typically En-
glish, but rather lamely excused it
away by saying his family was
from Australia. (Actually, it’s a
Polish name.) He plans to spend
today being blind for psychology.

Julian Mylchreest commented
on Davidson students’ ability to
work all day, then “throw a
switch, and there’s a party. Every-
thing is to extremes.” He sees
most Davidsonians viewing
Davidson as “an oasis of intense

pressure in the countryside,” al- —

_ like that at all.

most being somewhere where it
wasn’t intended. He can’t figure
out why Americans seem to eat so
much..

Holly Carter decided to come
here because “it is a good way to
lap up another culture that is paral-
lel to England. The best way to
understand a culture is to live and
work in it,” she said.

hat almost invariably found on her
head. Roughton, like many of the
scholars, has been struck by
American hospitality. She ex-
pected superficiality “but it’s not
I actually feel
guilty now about English reserve.
I don’t think that Americans in
England would get the same re-
ception we have.”

“People go out of their way to
help you here,” Carter agreed.
She also commented on contrasts.

between U.S. and British educa-’

tion. “It’s so different here, the
way you carry on the classes,” she
said. “In the seminars, people will
just talk and someone will say
“Hey, what’s the deal?’ It’s very
laid back.”

The concept of the liberal arts
education also seems foreign to
the scholars. “I’m so used to
specialization,” said Carter. “I’ve
spent the last two years studying
English literature. We get into
more detail,” but lose the diver-
sity.

“If you choose French, you do
only French,” said Ewbank. “Far
fewer go on to grad school.” The
structure of English schools tends
also to be less tight than David-
son’s. “You learn what you want;
it’s very much up to you.”

The Rusk scholars seem to be
taken with “Americanisms” they
have noted so far. “Shit happens,”

the blindfolded MacConnol said
cheerily after accidentally pouring
a milkshake up his nose.

Roughton found her first few
- days here depressing, but “things

are looking up” since she was es-
corted to Charlotte to get a denim
jacket. She finds Davidson’s set-
ting a bit limiting; “There aren’t
people our age around who aren’t
with the college,” she said.
Fraternities and sororities are
not seen in England. Carter is im-

pressed by the initiative and re-

sponsibility of the members. “In
England you have the (student)
union, and a small group of people
run this, and the rest of the stu-
dents join.” Here, “each house
sets up these parties, goes out and
hires the caterers... . It’s re-
sponsibilities that Americans pick
up that I’m not sure the English
would,” she said.

Mylchreest noted that the
fraternities are valuable as “pres-
sure valves, but a little cliquish.”
They’re “not different, but they
don’t quite tie in” with his initial
impression of Davidson in that
Hes aicule to break into a
group.”

Brendrowalsy) commented
that most Britons have “no com-
prehension of the size of America.
You can drive for ten hours (in
England) and go from the deep
south all the way to Scotland.” —

MacConnol stated that many
Americans view Britain “as a
country with a past but without a
future.” “I’m quite happy with
England as a second-rate country,
but I wish they’d (Britons) admit
it,” he said.

Ewbank also sees the oppo-
site: “Americans are seen as hav-
ing no past but a lot of future,” she
said. “The school the boys were at
was founded not long after Ameri-
ca was discovered.”

Americans tend to be “struck

“| by London as glamorous,” Carter’

says, and tend to think that all
Londoners are highly educated,
regardless of the reality: “It
doesn’t matter how they talk,” just
so long as they have a British ac-
cent, laughed Carter.

Carter affirms that England
“doesn’t want to be the 5lst
state,” but noted that the majority
of the Rusk Scholars see British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
“as Reagan’s lap dog.” Most Bri-
tons hold realistic views about
England’s world status. It’s “Rule
Britannia” for some, mostly’
young right wingers and older
people, she said.

“It’s not like we’ re completely
different,” said Roughton.

] “We've absorbed so® much of
America.” She noted that there-

was a bigger difference in going to
France, just across the English
Channel, than it is coming to the
U.S. “It’s not quite like going
abroad.” —
Dzendrowskyj says that he ar-
rived here with a “shightly anti-
American” bent due to.unpleasant
experiences with American
tourists back home. His view has

changed: “I suppose they’re the
same way when they’re here,

though,” he said. He noted that

Davidson wasn’t quite what he ex-
pected (Reagan, religion, and Re-
publicanism). “Most people

aren’t as I envisaged,” he said. -
~ Also, he expected less rain than

the region has received recently.
“Americans don’t know much
about England,” said Mylchreest.
“They have set ideas; it’s a power
that’s gone,” even that it rains all
the time. “The U.S. is a world
leader, but they don’t like anyone
else’s opinions; they box them-
selves off.” act
There is a fair amount of hos-
tility in England toward the U.S.,

he said, because of the trade situa-

tion. “The U.S. is seen as inter-
vening” and buying up British
companies left and right. “They
are seen as good guys, but with

too great a sense of their own im-

portance,” he said.

In the field of humor, also,
Americans are different,
Mylchreest. “American humor is
much more direct, more blunt. I
think that few American come-
dians are able to transfer over.”
He said that English humor tends
to draw on the typical and the ev-
eryday as its source. j

Dzendrowskyj spcinided his
remarks with references to Monty
Python routines. “They’ re very
popular in England. ... That.
and “Fawlty Towers” (a shat -run
British sitcom starring John
Cleese) are the epitome of British

humor.” He also said that Benny

Hill's variety show, while popular

in the United States, was just a
passing fad in England.

As far as American television
goes, Carter likes “Cheers,” par-
ticularly Sam and Diane, “but all
the other regulars make me want
to throw up.”

Dzendrowskyj said that “Top
Gun,” while drawing , young
women in search of Tom Cruise,
was not too popular an import.
Much more successful, he said,
are “Platoon” and “The Mission.”
Australian import. “Crocodile ©
Dundee,” also the U.S.’s biggest
imported film ever, was very
popular.

“Shit, like, ‘Animal House,’”
Roughton laughed, quoting her
friends at home and doing a fairly
good Belushi. she said that many
of her friends viewed America as
the land of the Blues Brothers and
Animal House.

Carter took exception to the
portrayal of England in such
popular American TV series as
“Brideshead Revisited”: “Ox-
ford’s not really like that,” she in-.
sisted. “Americans tend to see
England as either very quaint or as
the height of aristocracy.”
_MacConnol sees. Douglas
Adam’s “Hitchhiker’s Guide to
the Galaxy” series of novels as
“quite accurate” in its portrayal of

-England. He claims to have

brought his towel, but Carter ad-
mitted she was lacking hers.
Dzendrowskyj brought his, but
Mylchreest hadn’t read the book.

Petanque: Not bowling
with French accent

_ By JENNIFER HOFFMAN >
Forget all notions of pins,
spares, and strikes — petanque is
up a different alley all together.
Thierry Rousset, foreign ex-
change student from Lattes, Fr-
ance, has brought this sport to
Davidson where it is gaining in-
‘creasing popularity. i
Rousset cites the game’s sim-
plicity as one of its most appealing
qualities, making it fun even for
the beginner. Another plus is that
it requires very little equipment:
one wooden marker, two or three
metal balls with various identify-
ing stripes for each player, an
open patch of land, and two to six
people.
Preparation involves ‘ea uins
a circle approximately one and a
half inches in diameter at both
ends of the playing field. Standing
within this circle, a plaver from
the team chosen to go first throws
the small wooden ball or “boot” a
distance of six to ten yards. That
player then throws his first metal
ball, aiming for the wooden
marker. Next, a player from the

opposing team throws, attempting

to get his ball closer to the mark
than the first team. If he is suc-
cessful, his opponent tries again.
If he is unsuccessful, he and his
teammates continue to throw until
one of their balls lands closer or}.
until they are out of balls. Play al-
ternates back and forth according
to whichever team’s ball lies

least distance from the target.
When both teams have thrown ali
of their balls, the team nearest to
the marker wins, receiving one
point for every ball of theirs which
is closer than the nearest ball of

‘their opponents. The second game

begins at the opposite end of the
field. A team must accumulate 13

‘points to win.

_ Although the rules are simple,
petanque packs plenty of chal-
lenges. Any method: of throwing
is acceptable, but the “expert”

_ Style involves an overhand toss
with just the right amount of back-

spin. As player Ranjit Rawlley put
it, it requires “finesse.” The more
advanced players rely on complex
