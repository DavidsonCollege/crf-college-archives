Richie Havens. and Don
McLean bring their distinctive
styles of folk music to Davidson
for what may turn out to be a
surprisingly pleasant two
evenings of music for this
Spring Frolics.

Though their basic sound is
different, both musician’s
essential approach is based on
self-sufficiency, acoustic in-
struments and one-to-one en-
tertaining with the «audience.

Says Havens, ‘‘People may
come to hear me because of the
music, but they don’t just
identify with the music--I want
them to find out about them-
selves.”’ ‘

Havens, McLean spotlight Frolics ’75

Both performers began their
musical careers playing in folk
clubs: Havens in Greenwich
Village and McLean in upper-
state New York.

It was in these environments
that they learned their trade,
eventually convincing the
audiences that they learned
their trade, eventually con-
vincing the audiences: that their
music was more _ interesting
than their booze.

Havens generally takes his
performance material from the
compositions of today’s most
respected popular songwriters.

On his newest album he in-
terprets Dylan, McCartney,
Dave Mason, and Curtis
Mayfield songs among others.

Reflecting on his music,
Havens said, ‘‘Sometimes when

a new song is recorded people
will listen to the star who’s
singing it, not the song itself. So
when I sing it they listen to the
words for the first time and its
like a new song for them.”

Using a minimum of sidemen,
accompanying himself with his
rhythmic and forceful guitar
technique (for which he uses an
unorthodox open E-tuning)
Havens relies mainly on the
strength of his own personality
to get the music across.

McLean’s style has been
influenced by numerous in-
novators including the
Weaver’s , Pete Seeger and Lee
Hay.. as well as Josh White,
Woody Guthrie and Buddy
Holly.

He feels it is the duty of every
performer to keep _ these

pioneers in the public con-
sciousness.

Consequently, in concert he
sings songs such as Hank
Williams’ ‘‘Love Sick Blues,”’
Josh White’s ‘‘Where Were you
Baby, When My Heart Went
Out’’ and Buddy _ Holly’s
“Everyday,”’ in addition to his
original material.

Havens career began in 1962
at the height of the folk music
revival.

“I began hearing Len
Chandler, Dino ‘Valenti, and
Paul Stookey,” he says. ‘“‘They
inspired me to try singing.”

He began to receive serious
attention outside the Village
when his first album, ‘Mixed
Bag”’ was released.

Perhaps his most famous
concert appearances have been
at Woodstock and in London’s
Hyde Park prior to the opening
Blind Faith concert.

McLean became an overnight

sensation in mid-October of 1971

when his single, ‘‘American
Pie’’ topped every national
record chart, selling an in-
credible two million copies.
‘“‘Time,”’ ‘‘Life’’ and
‘‘Newsweek’’ wrote of his
genius and compared
‘American Pie,’ to Dylan’s
‘‘Subterranean Homesick
Blues.’’ For'a one year period,
McLean sold out major halls
throughout the world. 2
The concert grind took its toll
as McLean, the artist, became
increasingly uninspired. In
1973, he gave up writing and
performing and retired with his
wife to an old house in upper-

state New York. Since then he
slowly but steadily regained
confidence in his writing and
performing abilities.

McLean was apparently
encouraged to learn that Lori
Hieberman’s ‘‘Killing Me Softly
With A Song’’ (which became
an international hit by Roberta
Flack) was inspired by one of
his performances at the
Troubadour in L.A.

With an old friend, mandolin
virtuoso Frank Wakefield, he
returned to playing small clubs
like the Cafe Lena in Saratoga
Springs.

More important he has begun
to compose ‘again, or as he put
it, ‘‘my muse has returned.”
The result is a new album called
‘Homeless Brother.”

“Rolling Stone’’ magazine
described the L.P. as a
thoroughly appealing album
that properly showcases his
impressive strengths--sincerity,
good humor and a lovely naive
romanticism...It.erases any
memory of his depressing

comedown from the
phenomenal success of
“‘American Pie.”’

Centered symbolically».

around hobos, the album tries to
conceptualize the loveless
condition of these homeless
brothers, and by extension, our
lives.

As it turns out, the’ music
format for Spring Frolics is
radically different from the
English rock show rumored
earlier, yet it promises to be an
exciting and possibly intimate
weekend of music none the less.
