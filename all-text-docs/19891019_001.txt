Reform or revolution?

By Suzanne Craymer

Davidson students and
faculty explored the changes in
Gorbachev’s Soviet Union on
October 10 through 12. The
speakers stressed economic
issues and military concerns. In
addition, the conference evalu-
ated the growing tensions
within the Soviet Union as
Gorbachev's ‘reforms take
hold.

Stanford University pro-
fessor Alexander Dallin gave
the opening address on Tues-
day, October 10 at 11 a.m. He
identified Gorbachev's re-
forms, which started in 1985, as
a “slow unravelling of the sys-
tem.” Under Gorbachev, the

Concluding the three day-
long conference, “Gorbachev's
Soviet Union: Reform or Revo-
lution?” last Thursday, Robert
Williams, dean of faculty,
stressed the need for humility
in attempting to understand
_ the “dramatic and far-reaching
‘developments in the Soviet

Union under Gorbachev.”
_ ° Williams stated that the
extent of the reforms in the
Soviet Union alone have taken

Soviet Union begana shift from
centralized Stalinist commu-
nism toa more pluralistic soci-
ety. This change provides So-
viet citizens with moreindivid-
ual rights. Dallin, however,
identified violent riots as a
possible negative outgrowth of
the new freedoms given to citi-
zens. “The biggest failure is the
economy, he said. “It isn’t
working.”

The conference continued
on Wednesday with Igor
Khripunov, first secretary in
the Soviet Embassy in Wash-
ington. Khripunov shocked the
audience. with his viewpoint
on Soviet foreign affairs. “We
are damn serious about

the world by surprise. Thus

trying to predict where the re-
forms wi he Soviet Un-
ion isan extraordinarily diffi-
cult task.

“If we could not forecast
the reforms, how can we fore-
cast their fate?” he challenged.

He suggests that develop-
ments in the Soviet Union are
best viewed with an. open
mind. “A liberal arts education
should teach students to apply
a breath of knowledge to new

reshaping our foreign policy,”
he said, “We have done many
things in the past that we re-
gard as mistakes.” One event
which Khripunov highlighted
as harmful to the Soviet Union
was the continued manufac-
ture of chemical weapons after
a ban in 1960. He also con-
demned_ the Soviet Union’s
conduct during the 1983 peace
talks with President Reagan.
Khripunov regretted that the
talks had not lasted longer.
Compared with past events,
Khripunov called Gorbachev's
policies “a revolution.”

“If we could not forecast the reforms, how can we forecast their
fate?” asked vice president of faculty Bob Williams in his conclud-
ing remarks at this year’s NCNB sponsored conference on the
recent changes in the Soviet Union.

Wildcats wallop Methodist 52-0!

Football team revels in the feeling of winning, and winning big

By GIGGY MAXWELL

The Packers of the 60’s. The Steelers of
the 70’s. The Bears, Forty-Niners and
Redskins of the 80’s. The Wildcats of
1989.

The Wildcats of 1989?

You'll have to excuse the visions of
grandeur, but as a faithful four-year
follower of Davidson's gridiron ex-
ploits, Saturday’s 52-0 thrashing of the
Methodist Monarchs was a win of dy-
nastic proportions.

William the Conquerer never won By
52 points.

Ok, so no one is going to confuse
“Methodist’s football program with
Clemson’s. In this, their innaugural
season, the Monarchs have been shut
out in five of six games. Their roster is

‘

almost completely made up of fresh-
man and sophomores, ‘much like
Davidson’s roster four years ago.

But for this week none of that matters
to the Wildcats, who finally have the
oppurtunity to enjoy winning, and
winning big.

The Wildcat offense, which had been
battling a scoring drought all season,
erupted in a deluge of points that made
the scoreboard resemble Jose Canseco’s

_odometer. It might have been worse
had a slick clock operator not managed
to transform 12:52 remaining in the
fourth quarter into pS in the blink of
an eye.

As has become the Wildcats trade-
mark, offensive yardage was again
chalked up primarily on the ground as

TB Ralph Isernia (14 carries, 73 yards)
and FB Brian Kelly (9 carries, 60 yards)
led an attack that accumulated 246
yards rushing.

The attack was so balanced that three
different Davidson runningbacks
scored, with Isernia and TB Bryn Robin-
son netting two apiece. A fourth back,
Travis Hinson, scampered in for his
Own score On a 27-yard interception
return while playing in the secondary.

TE Tony Lambert caught two passes
for 70 yards which accounted for the
majority of QB Peter Hughes’s 120
yards in passing.

The defense also played well for the
third straight week, asitrecorded seven
turnovers and notched its second shut-
out of the season. In fact, Methodist was

having so many problems moving the
ball, that, atthe half, Davidson had actu-
ally been penalized for more yards (72)
than the Monarchs could manage in
total offense (71).

In the second quarter, when the game
wasactually still in the balance, one key
play stands out that-put the ‘Cats into
overdrive--and it wasn’t evena play on
the field. As the yellow flag (signifying
a late hit by DB Mike Carney) de-
scended on the Methodist sideline, the
entire Methodist bench descended onto
Mike Carney. At the time, Methodist
was driving in Wildcat territory and a
score would have reduced the Wildcat
