Junior Spends Fall in Africa With Field Studies School

By John Rowe

My sophomore year,
I really needed to 'go
somewhere completely
different; the decision
to spend my fall semes-
ter in Kenya was one of
the easier ones in my life.
I travelled to Africa with
the School for Field
Studies wildlife manage-
ment and conservation
program with twenty-
nine other students, but
the lessons and experi-
ences I hold most dearly have little
todo with game management. The
three months that I spent in Africa
were amazing, and I wish that I
could relive every second there
from day one.

Our camp and the ranch that
surrounded it meant the most to
me. The camp was extravagant
compared to the lifestyles of most
Kenyans. When say extravagant,
I mean thatour outhouses, or choos
in Swahili, had seats and that our
shower water was warm some of

the time. The camp was also sur-
rounded by much wildlife; giraffe
and monkeys wandering through
our courtyard during class time
would always jolt me into the re-
alization of being in Africa. There,
even the most basic activities held
a certain excitement; going to the
choos in the morning, I would of-
ten spark the curiosity of a family
of monkeys living ina tree outside

my choo window. We quickly

learned to appreciate the small
things around us.

No matter when
or where someone
spends time abroad,
that person will gain
a new and different
perspective on life.
Forme, the people of
Kenya had the most

profound effect. Even in the face. .

of extreme poverty, the Kenyans
retained an intense generosity,
compassion, happiness, and love
of camaraderie. Otieno, a Kenyan
who spent much time with us,

Jones Travels To Israel for Christmas Break

By Susan Sheffield

Meg Jones, a junior religion
major, spent her Christmas vaca-
tion in the place Christ was born
and raised.

Ona student study tour of the
Mideast sponsored by the Univer-
sity of lowa Campus Ministry, she
visited several historical sites, such
as Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Naza-
reth, Galilee and Jericho. The spiri-
tual feeling of being in an area of
such significance was amazing: “I
thought my insides were going to
burst.... One night I was listening
tothe prayers being sung out, These
~ were powerful sounds that vibrate
to your soul. I would get mad
when a car would come by and
honk becausei it would drown them
out.”

However, this wasno ordinary
30 cities in 15 days tour. The
mission of the journey was to give
the students a clearer factual basis

for their thoughts on the Middle .

East conflict. America’s near-
blanket pro-Israel policies are the
bulk of what form our citizen’s
opinions. This ‘program, admit-
tedly slanted toward: the Palestin-
ian plight, allowed the students to

Foreign Ministry Department. As
Meg summarized his speech, she
was taken aback by some of his
statements in
edge of human rights abuses di-
_ rectedat Palestinians, specifically

that, “Israel is a democratic sale

t of her knowl-

where everyone expresses himself
freely.”

Other points that he made: one,
Israel wants no monetary support

from any nation. Two, the Jewish

state would rather suffer criticism
than to lose its homeland. Three,
Arab countries like to have the
Palestinians visible and suffering
inorder to garnet worldsympathy,
so they will not absorb the refu-
gees. According to Meg, he never
did elaborate on why their meth-
ods of control over the Arabs were
so harsh, though asked several
times,

ample, one man spoke of the work
permits for which he must apply
every three months in order to cross
into the eastern side of the city
safely. Furthermore, he only re-
ceives 700 shekels a month at his
job. Ifhe were a Jewish man in the
same position, he might be able to
afford his 2,000 shekel a month
rent.

~ Despiteall thatshe saw inGaza,
Meg was able to remain objective
about the Israeli people. A visit to
the Yad vaShem Holocaust Mu-

-seum reminded her of the atroci-

ties of the 1930’s and ‘40’s.

_ Nonetheless, she was saddened
by the observation that she and
several others on the trip made,
that in several of the descriptions
of oppression of the Jewish people
the word Palestinian could be
substituted.

All Israelis are not in favor of
the occupation of Palestine. One

-group, the Women in Black, stage

a silent protest every Friday on a
busy intersection in Jerusalem.

Even the soldiers havg no idea
about the complexity of the situ-

“why they can’t have peace,” says

Meg.
Everyone she spoke to wanted
an end to the conflict, but how
could they achieve it? Partition,
relocation of the Arabs, orco-exis-
tence are the obvious choices, but
what would happen? “This trip

taught the group a new way of
looking at life; he thought that we,
“crazy Americans” had lost sight
of the whole picture. ‘In other
words, we had forgotten the basic
art of living life simply, an art that

cannot be learned by spending just
three months there, but that can be
admired.

Since trips to the shower were
rare and trips to the choo all too
frequent, the friendships within our
group sprung from tales of diar-
rhea and body odor. The twenty-
nine of us, including Davidson
juniors Heather Tarpley and Lara
Teal, learned to tolerate each
other’s foibles and live together
twenty-four hours a day for three
months. We suffered through many

‘” things, including our cooking of

such creations as giraffe burgers,
rice with the consistency of grits,
and meatballs made of zebra meat.

Thesesmall problems strengthened

our friendships which, in turn, en-
hanced our appreciation of the sur-
rounding country:

Going abroad offers an im-
mense opportunity that nobody
should miss. Whether the time is

graduation, it does not matter; it is
all what you make of it.

A Brief History
of Davidson's Literary

Societies:

By Towner Blackstock
Students of today’s Davidson
College would hardly recognize
the Davidson of 1837, then just a
budding school of three professors
and about sixty students.

Imagine a place with a two
story chapel instead of Cunning-
ham Fine Arts Building, three
dorms (Oak and Elm, with a third
long gone), anda professor’ s house
where the current well is located.

There were no sports, no fraterni- —

ties, no town (yet), no girls, andthe
closest city was over twenty miles
away during a time when there
were no trains or Cars.

Asclasses went, everyone took
Latin, Greek, algebra, and geome-
try for the first two,years, with
some sciences tha in during
the last two. No one had any
choices as to what class to take,
and all of the classes were com-
pletely rhetorical, meaning you spit
out what you read and didn’t think
for yourself. To the eyes of any

modern student, the Davidson of .

1837 wasa stifling place... and the
students of 1837 would probably

have agreed,

“After about a month on cam-
pus, they created the first of two
literary societies. These groups

nineteenth century. They were the

fraternities of the day, with secret

functions, anda sometimesrowdy,
but deeply honorable, reputation.
Davidson’s societies were no ex-
ception, and their legacy continues
to this day.

The Eumenean Debating So-
ciety (known at first as Polemic)
was founded in April of 1837, and
the Philanthropic Literary Society
first met in June. According to
Eumenean minutes, they were
started “as a means of improve-
ment not to be secured in the
regular college work.”

The Preamble of the Phi Soci-
ety describes such improvementas
“the study of rhetoric, logic, and
ethic... ahigh regard for virtue and
truth,” and the growth of ‘closer
bonds of friendship” with “those
we feel interested and deem wor-
thy of our esteem”. The rhetoric
bit certainly doesn’t sound like a
fraternity, and for sure, they hardly
seemed to act like one from the
accounts of their meetings.

Meetings were held on Wed-
nesday nights and Monday morn-
ings in the basement rooms of the
college chapel. Usually a topic
would be assigned the previous

‘meeting, anda few members would

be selected to debate the topic,
while others would have to turn in
formal papers or deliver a speech.
These topic ranged from “‘is fe-
