Tech took the second from the
Wildcats by a score of 5 to 0, This
was an uneventful game as regards
spectacular plays and hitting. The
Jackets hit in bunches and in the
first and the third innings scored
their runs. Asbury for Tech pitch-
ed a good game and kept the Red
and Black followers scoreless. Both
the fielding machines worked nicely
and both teams put through several
double plays. Cassel at short played
a good game for D. C., handling sev-
eral awkward chances easily. Miley
pitched a good game and the score
would have been less had not his
support committed several errors.

ech started the bloody work in

bagger by Turner.

First, our relation to other countries
would be hindered. Second, we
would be changed to a nation am-
bitious for military training. Hough-
ton had plenty of life in his speech
and gave a good argument.

The rebuttals were spirited and
showed good preparation.

The judges then gave in their de-
cision that the Eus had triumphed
and that Bray for the Phis and Bit-
zer for the Eus were the medal win-
ners.

COMMENCEMENT

the Senior class.

Instead of the Davidson seal the

and the class numeral underneath.

Every man is urged to get his a!-
loted number of these invitations,
and at least send his parents or
some alumnus one.

Students should send out all of
these invitations and have the larg-
est crowd at the nineteen-twenty
commencement that Davidson has
ever seen.
