Services
In Review

By J. S. Blain
Led by Dr. Donald W. Richard-

son, November 14-16, the YMCA
Fall Services were proclaimed a
great success by all concerned.

While he was on the campus, Dr.
Richardson visited at» the various
boarding houses, and; on Wednes
day morning, had breakfast at the
Guest the
the ‘Y’ Cabinet and several faculty
members. He met with the
cabinet in its meeting on Tuesday
evening, and held
ences in the afternoon with students
who desired to talk with’ Him.

The opening address
in Chapel on Tuesday morning and
the text was the fourth chapter of

House with members ot

Was mad

Luke. Using this story of Jesus
temptation in the wilderness, Dr.
Richardson urged ‘the students to

seek the permanent things of life,
and not to “live by bread alone”.
He pictured the three men, Karl
Marx, Adolph Hitler, and Jesus
Christ, “as standing at the cross-
roads of the world, each’ with a
book in one hand and with the
other hand beckoning to the peo-
ple of the world to follow. Pointing
out that’ Christ is the only person
around whom true religion is cen-
tered, he said that only Christ can
be followed with ny degree of hope
in eternal life.

Tuesday night's message was on
“Being a Christian”, and empha-
the necessity for Christ-like
living by every person. Our charact-
er, said Dr. Richardson, is the re-
production of our ‘thoughts about
God, and our duty is to glorify
God by living in His light.

On morning, Dr.
Richardson said that the question
today’ is not whether we have reli-
gion but rather what kind of relgion
do we have. The characteristics of
the true religion are its reasonable-
ness, its practicability, and its spir-
ituality. Christianity as a religion is
real, reasonable, practical, spiritual,

and eternal.
The sermon Wednesday tight
was on the “Romance of Chris-

tianity.”. Many of us find this ro

mance “in  “mountain-top exper-
but the real test is in find

ing it in the routine of daily life.

iences’,

The romance of religious life is
not in believing but in doing the
will of God. This is co-operative

enterprise, for “not even God can

do our best without our best to

help him”.

Pikas-Pi Kaps
To Have Dance

To Be Held At Myers Park
Country Club

Friday night, December lst, will
be a big night in the social affairs
of the Pikas and Pi Kaps. On that
night all will be at the Myers Park
Country Cub for dancing with Fleet
Green and his orchestra.

As yet plans are rather indefinite
but the opinion of all the Pikas and
P: Kaps is that they will have a
gala occasion. A crowd of opproxi-
mately fifty is expected to attend.
This Pi Kap-Pika function in the
pre-Christmas has been a
tradition at Davidson for the past
several years, and if the success of
these functions is any _ indication
of the success of the forthcoming
one, a good time should be had by

season
