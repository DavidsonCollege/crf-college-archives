Davidson Does Dallas, et al
Concert Choir, Jazz and Wind Ensembles tour during break

By DIANA BOHRER
People can engage in five basic activities
ona bus.
—Sophomore Amy Burton
on the Spring Chorus Tour

Three of Davidson’s musical organi-
zations, the Concert Choir, Wind En-
semble, and Jazz Ensemble, took their
annual tours during spring break, per-
forming a total of fourteen times in seven
states.

Music professor Vladimir Morosan
conducts the Choir, which consists of
both male and female choruses. This
year's tour of Texas, Louisiana,
Alabama, and South Carolina was a suc-
cess, he said, because “there was a
growth process” in the choir.

He added that the concert in Houston
was the one he would remember best be-
cause “‘a special atmosphere” prevailed
that evening that was “difficult to put into
words.” Davidson students, alumni, and
parents showed up for most of the con-
certs, which made the performers feel
welcome.

Living with music for a week pre-
sented a unique opportunity for the sin-
gers to come together “‘as a musical fam-
ily,” Morosan explained.

While travelling, Morosan revised a
manuscript for publication. As sopho-
more Amy Burton pointed out, there are
five activities that one can engage in on
the bus: reading, writing letters, talking,
card-playing, and sleeping.

Sophomore Laura McDonald, who
sings and accompanies the group on
piano, agreed with Morosan that the
eight days of working, singing, and
travelling together fostered “a feeling of
unity” among the choir members becuase
it was a chance to get to know one
another at least superficially. “I read a lot
on Baroque music,” she recalls, “‘and I’m
still enjoying my sunburn.”

“| think the most memorable things
were the concerts,” senior Neal Biggers
said. “I never forget the one in Dallas.”
Although not a choir member, Biggers
accompanies the Choir on several pieces.
He enjoyed the challenge of visiting a
different church every night and compar-
ing “the different organs I got to play.”

Music Professor William Lawing,
who conducts both instrumental ensem-
bles, said that this spring’s trip to Vir-
ginia, Maryland and Delaware was “as
good as any tour we’ ve had, from a musi-
cal standpoint.” Because the distances
between cities are shorter in the East than
in the West, the musicians enjoyed free
time in Baltimore, New York City,

Washington, and Williamsburg. Lawing
found that the Balance between perform-
ing, resting, and visiting was helpful to
the players. Like Morosan, he was “ex-
tremely pleased with the growth that oc-
curred during the week.”

Since every concert but one was in an
ensemble member's hometown, their au-
diences contained many close friends
and relatives as well as some past music
students. On their free day in New York
City, players went dancing in Greenwich
Village, saw Cats and A Chorus Live on
Broadway, and heard the New York
Philharmonic Orchestra. According to
senior Jeff Nielsen, the free day was the
only day all week that the group encoun-

tered rain. Nielsen said that the National
Aquarium and Harbor Place, a restored
waterfront, were among the most
memorable sights in Baltimore. Senior
Melissa McKeithen’s fondest memory of
the trip was the mini-skirt contest she en-
tered in a club in New York City.
“People were really closer on this
tour than ever before,” Jon Lawry,a vet-
eran of five tours, commented. “By far

it’s the best tour we’ve done.” Lawry
headed up the group’s “second annual
limerick-writing extravaganza,” as he

describes it. Lawing praised this year’s
poems, saying, “Both the quality and the
wit were outstanding although they can
never be repeated in public.”
