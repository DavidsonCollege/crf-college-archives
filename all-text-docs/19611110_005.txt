THE LAST GAME

play av S omoee OVER for thirteen Davidson football
afternoon when i
the end of the Wofford game. the final gun sounds

Thirteen seniors will take off the old pads for the |
last time, and hang up that famous piece of athletic |
equipment that David Dakin made so popular for the
last time.

Some will be glad; some won't. But regardless of :
each man’s personal feelings when he finishes his foot- .
ball career, all will have something in common. All of
them have put in four hard years of work for Davidson |
College. All of them have sweated, knocked heads, re-
ceived innumerable bumps and bruises, and put in long
hours of practice trying to be a better football player. |
And yet, it sometimes séems that all of this has been}
for nothing. If Davidson beats Wofford tomorrow, it
will be only the third time these seniors have tasted
victory on their home field.

But the work was not wasted. For most, playing!
football earned them a college education. For all, it
instilled a true feeling of team spirit and created the
healthy desire to win. They have been a part of the most
tangible aspect of the Davidson Spirit:

And so tomorrow is the day when thirteen shed their
football suits for the clothes of Dr. Ernie Patterson’s
cruel world. We believe they’re better men for it.

We salute Booker Clark, Jerry Sheffield, Jennings
Snider, Bill Whittington, Lou Zirkle, Bill Salzer, Bill
Shumaker, Dave Lovette, Cecil Holcomb, Bruce Usher,
Duncan Morton, Lynwood Mallard. and Bob McAllister.

Thanks, fellows. Davidson College is indebted to you

for a job well done.

NOTES

THE WOFFORD SERIES began in 1914, and since
then Davidson has won 19, lost 4, and tied 1. Wofford
won last year, 6-0.

°S° RUMORED that Lefty Driesell wants to play
Cincinnati in basketball next year. The Bearcats defeated
Ohio State a year ago for the national championship.

HATS OFF to Joe Martin and his cheerleaders for
the fine job they have been doing this year in stirring up
school spirit. They plan to continue their work during
basketball season, and will even be selling tickets in the
dorms to the Wake Forest opener in Winston-Salem

on Dec. 2.

THE CRYSTAL BALL (29-18)

DAVIDSON wants to break even so bad they can
taste it. And we believe they will. Wofford is good, but
an inspired Wildcat band playing their last game of the
season should be too much for the Terriers. Pick David-
son, 21-13.

The fact that The Citadel is Southern Conference
champion should give Florida State just enough incentive
to beat the Bulldogs, who should suffer a let down after
last week's title clincher. Pick Florida State, 7-3.

Richmond could really bring the conference some
prestige if they won tomorrow. But that’s just about the
biggest if I can think of. The Spiders play number two
nationally-ranked Alabama, and the Tide isn't going to
stop rolling this week. Pick Bama, 28-7.

Other predictions: Furman 21, East Carolina 7; VMI
20, Buffalo 6; Wake Forest 14, VPI 0; Penn State 14; West
Virginia 7; and Army 28, William & Mary 6.

Visit Duke

Booters
This Monday Atternoon

BY BILL PRIDGEN
Davidsonian Sports Writer

This afternoon the Davidson soccer team met a
newly formed Appalachian team here. The ‘Cats were
heavily favored in the match.

Monday afternoon the booters
travel to Durham to meet one
‘of their toughest opponents of
the season—Duke. Earlier this
year, the Blue Devils whipped
N. C. State, 10-0, a team that
tied Davidson, 3-3, here last
Thursday.

mented on the Duke match by
saying, “Using comparative
scores, they should beat us 8 or
9 goals. In everyone's (coaches,
referees, press) opinion, they
have the best soccer team in
these parts.”

The Wildcats. will carry a
record of two straight victories
over the Blue Devils to Durham.
In 1959 they toppled the Devils,
1-0, and last year they clipped
the Methodist men here, 3-2.

This past Tuesday, Davidson
‘Jost a heartbreaker to Pfeiffer,
_%2, on the Falcons’ home soil,
Trailing 2-1 in the second half,
the scholarship-rich Falcons
rallied for the win, their ninth
of the season. The 'Cats are now
4-2-1.

Joe Kelly and Allen Jones
booted goals for the ‘Cats. Kel-
ly and Fred Schoen are the
team’s leading scorers.

Fogelman tabbed the Pfeiffer
match “a well played match by
both teams,” and he added that
his team could easily be unde-
feated right now if a few extra
breaks had fallen somewhere
along the way. The ‘Cats have
outscored their opponents, 24-
13, and have lost only one match
Wy more than one goal—to
UNC, 0-2.

the Wofford Terriers visit Richardson Stadium on Char-

wtte-Mecklenburg Day.

Coach Bill Dole’s men cur-
rently have a 3-4 record follow-
ing a 31-30 heart-stopping vic-
tory over William & Mary last
weekend. Leading 31-14 in the
fourth quarter, the ‘Cats sur-
vived a last minute barrage by
the Indians, who gambled for
two extra points instead of
kicking for the “sure” one and
a tie. But the Davidson defense
arose to the oceasion, and the.
‘Cats had themselves a confer-
ence win. which enabled. them to
escape the cellar.

There were many heroes in
the William & Mary win. but
the following stood out in, par-
ticular: Earl Cole, who threw
for two TD's: Alex Gibbs, who
| caught one of Cole’s TD passes
and who threw one. himself. to
} Jerry Sheffield: Dave Lopp, who
| scored two TD's: Booker Clark.
who recovered a limely fumble
and who played his usual bang-
up game; and Bruce Usher. who
booted a 19-yard field goal and
the four deciding extra points.

Wofford combines a_ strong
aerial game and a devastating
ground game for their offensive
machine that has scored 162
points in 8 games: This offense
has enabled them to compile a
5-2-1 record, with wins over
Elon, PC, Newberry, E. Tenn.
St., and Catawba. Their losses
were to Howard and. Furman,
and they tied Lenoir Rhyne on
opening night.

Quarterback Tommy Ellis
the big wheel in the Terriers’
offense. He hurled two TD
passes in the Lenoir Rhyne
game, and he outclassed Fur-

is

man’s highly touted Bill Canty
in their game, which Furman
won by the slim margin of 12:7.

Halfback Bob Roma is a
powerfu. runner, who romped
84 yards for a TD against Fur-

“man and who tallied 3 times

last week against Catawba.

Dole plans no radical changes
for the club's final game. How-
ever, several. injuries against
William & Mary may force him
to make: some personnel adjust-
ments. Defensive end Jennings
Snider was injured. and is not
expected to see action. Also de-
fensive halfback Bob Cordle was
reinjured and may have to sit
this one out.

Probable starting lineups, of-
fensive and defensive, are as
follows:
