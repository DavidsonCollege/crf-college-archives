g Devon case:

PAC plans no investigation

By PAM CAMERRA

“As iar as the Professione!
Affairs Committee (PAC) is
concerned, the Devon case is
closed unless Dr. Devon herself
wishes to make a complaint,”
said Chairman of the PAC
Albert Wolf, Professor of
Physics.

‘The College Administration:
decided in December not to
renew the contract of Assistant
Professor of Political Science
and Director of South Asian
Studies Tonia Devon. In recent
weeks, students and faculty
have expressed concern over the
subjectivity of the Administra-
tion’s evaluation of Devon.

Last week six students asked
the PAC in a letter to conduct
an ‘‘immediate and thorough
investigation”’
case.

The PAC met Wednesday to
discuss the students’ letter and
the possibility of conducting an
investigation. The statement
released at the end of the
meeting explained that the PAC
could not take further action
presently on the Devon case.

of designated testing period

By LYNN PEACE

Vice-President of Academic
Affairs T.C. Price Zimmermann
stressed Friday in a memoran-
dum to the faculty that final
exams are to be given only
during the designated period.

All exams will be scheduled
between February 27 and
March 2, except in courses with
“special circumstances.”

Zimmermann pointed out se-
veral “unfortunate irregulari-
ties’’ in scheduling during the
fall examination period.Some
exams were given on the last
day of classes, on Reading Day,
or beyond the established per-
iod.

According to the memoran-
dum, the number of professors
using self-scheduled examina-
tions varies from term to term
and ranges from 54 per cent to
65 per cent.

Zimmermann suggested if
the faculty is dissatisfied with
the self-scheduled exam sys-
tem, the Educational Policy
Committee should be asked to
study examination practices
and recommend a change.

Some professors do see prob-
lems in the self-scheduléd
examination system.

rirst, self-scheduling pushes
the honor system “‘to the nth
degree,’’ according to one pro-

fessor. This is due to the very
nature of a ten-week term and
the heavy emphasis placed upon
finals. He said the honor system
works well for 90 per cent of the
students, but indicated that it
is easy for a professor to focus
upon the exceptions.

A second issue is that of
flexibility for the individual
professor. Professor of History
David G. Rice emphasized that
‘‘there need not be just one
mode of test-taking.”’

He views the final evaluation
of a course as ‘‘the business of
the instructor only. He is
responsible’ for setting the cri-
teria, monitoring fulfillment of
the criteria, and certifying that
the criteria have been honestly
met.”

Third, the self-scheduled
examination system requires
that a professor turn in a copy
of his final before the course has
actually ended. He is forced to
anticipate how much material
he will cover in the last days of
class.

A fourth problem is the
three-hour time limit. Not all
professors desire to give a
three-hour exam. Some pro-
fessors have resorted to opera-
ting a modified self-scheduled

systent ruin uitir offices.

In comparison. to other
schools’ exam systems, Profes-

sor of Philosophy Lance K.Stell
finds that Davidson’s system is
“highly desirable’ and ‘‘de-
serves support.”

The faculty had mixed reac-
tions to the tone of the memo.
Stell found it ‘“‘a good strong
statement”’ on the necessity of
following exam period guide-
lines.

Rice, on the other hand, saw
an indication of ‘‘a basic lack of
understanding of human needs
for flexibility for both faculty
and students.”’

Another opinion was that the
memorandum might have been
‘“‘a bit more diplomatic.”’

college constitution,’ said
Wolf.

Paragraph II of Article X
concerns the reappointment of
non-tenured faculty. It states
“If a faculty member on proba-

tionary appointment alleges

'that a decision not to reappoint

him was based significantly on
considerations violative of aca-
demic freedom, or considera-
tions violative of stated policies
of the college in respect of non-
discrimination on the basis of
race, sex, or national origin in

employment practices, or per-
sonal malice, the allegation will
be given preliminary considera-
tion by the Professiona: Auairs
Committee which will seek to
settle the matter by informal
methods.”’

“The allegation,’’ it contin-
ues,‘‘shall be accompanied by a
statement that the faculty
member agrees to the presenta-
tion, for the consideration of the
faculty committees, of such

She explained that if a house

from the freshman or junior
waiting lists hefore they would
choose from the sophomore list.
