Dr. Brown to Talk
Friday at Banquet
of Ministerial Band

Short Talks by Student Members
to Feature Feed Also

The annual feed of the Ministerial
Band will be held tomorrow night at 9 :30,
in the basement of the church. A snappy
program has been planned to give a good
time to all. Dr. C. K. Brown is sched-
uled for a pithy talk. There will also be
a few short talks by the student members.
Every man who is a ministerial student,
regardless of whether or not he has at-
tended the regular meetings of the band,
has been invited by card to be present.
Cards were supposed to have been handed
to F. D. Miller at}/109 West before: last
Tuesday night withi the information as to
whether or not he would be present. If
any one finds at a late hour that he might
be able to go, a plate may be arranged
by seeing F. D. Miller today.

At the meeting gf the band Sunday aft-
ernoon, Professor Beaty spoke to the
band, giving the members practical sug-
gestions of preparation. Himself a
preacher, he was qualified for aiding the
potential preacher. As a continuation of
the advice given by Dr. Foreman last
week, on the importance of reading, Pro-
fessor Beaty showed the importance of
writing and composition.

Dr. C. R. Harding will speak to the
Ministerial Band Sunday afternoon at
2:30. A special subject will be treated.

Response to Honors

Course is Meager

From the number which are talsing the
Honor Courses, made available by the
board of trustees last year, the response
of the students for the year is meager.
Only four men, according to the available
report, are engaged in this college work,
done on the graduate plan.

H. S, Davidson is taking an »Honors
Course in Chemistry; R. B. Hayes, of the

senor class, is taking one in Physics; two

seniors, G. A. Fry and Reid Graham, are
taking Honors Courses in Philosophy.

The Honors Courses are open to all

members of the two upper classes who

have met “certain requirements in their
scholastic work during their first two
years. The student works alone, under

the weekly direction of the head of his

department, with an examination jat the
end of the. term.

Tryouts for the debating team will he
held on December 4, 5 and 6, and the
teams will be picked at this time. The
question for the tryouts has not been de-
cided upon.

The fresh team will have two debates
this year; following an old custom, one
will probably be the Carolina freshmen.

There are only five varsity debaters in
school: W. L. Dumas, W. K. Pritchett,
R. M. Christian, C. R. Pritchett, and W.
B. McGuire, Jr. W. K. Pritchett -vill

FACULTYY MEMBERS HAVE
NEW HOMES

During the summer several of the fac-
ulty members moved to new homes. It is
rather confusing to the students to know
just where to visit them, and accordingly
a list is given here with which to locate
them.

Dr. Guy R. Vowles has moved to Sloan

Washington, Oct. 3—(1P)—The num-
ber of institutions for the higher’ educa-
tion of the negro race in the United States
more than doubled, and enrollments  in-
creased more than six-fold during the past
10 years, according to the report recently
issued by the Bureau of Education of the
Interior Department.

In 1917, according to the report, there
were 31 negro institutions offering college
work, while in 1927, of the 79 institutions
included in the survey, there were 77 en-
gaged in college work.

The enrollments in the 31 institutions
10 years ago amounted to 2,132 negro stu-
dents, as compared with 13,680 attending
institutions surveyed in 1917—an increase
of 550 per cent.

The annual income of ‘the negro uni-
versities and colleges in the United States
also has gained at a rapid rate. In 1917
it totaled $2,283,000, while in 1927 the
annual income was $8,560,000, or an in-
crease of 275 per cent.
