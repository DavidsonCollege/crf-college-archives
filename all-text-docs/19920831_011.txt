1992: The Year Of The Woman

National media pro-
claimed 1992 “The Year of the
Woman.” Eight months into it,
American women and men cannot
ignore the immense power women,
specifically political commenta-
tors, political candidates, and po-
litical wives wield in the races for
Congress and the presidency.

From Hillary Clinton to
Marilyn Quayle, from Barbara
Boxer to Carol Moseley Braun,
political w readily capture
headlines and imaginations. But
why this year? Why this election?
What do the women of 1992 have
that previous generations have only
dreamed of?

We’ve got numbers.
More women than ever before are
running for office. Dianne
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, Cali-
fornia democrats leading their races
for Senate; have the opportunity to
carry California out of its cultural
and economic crisis and into glory

as the only state in history to elect -

two women to serve in
Washington’s prestigious “Boy’s
Club.” Their election would liter-
ally double the number of female
faces in that traditional institution.
Illinois democrat Carol Moseley
Braun runs a good chance of being
the first woman of color to enter
the Senate, offering a personal and
political perspective never before
seen on Capitol Hill.

We’ve got attention.
Even President Bush, unable to

criticize democrat Bill Clinton, al-
lows his aides and speech writers
to dig into Clinton’s wife. Pat
Buchanan’s ridiculously conser-
vative address to the Republican
convention was loaded with anti-
feminist and (many would agree)
anti-woman rhetoric. Not that
women are cowed by these feeble
blasts. Barbara Bush, rather than
appeasing the fundamentalist
camp, publicly disagreed with
Buchanan’s policies, and by de-
fault, the policies of Dan Quayle.
Hillary Clinton, hardly a wall-
flower, responds with humor and
biting wit to cach attack by those
more comfortable with women
locked into kitchens and nurseries
than clocked into work.

We’ve got empathy.
Mary Fisher’s heart-wrenching
plea for AIDS education and re-
search funding atthe GOP national
convention was based on her expe-
rience as a wife, mother, and long-
time Republican. Anybody alive
last fall remembers the face of Anita
Hill, harassed, ignored, and ridi-
culed by the all-male panel of moral
judges, too concerned with appear-
ing racially open toremember feel-
ing honestly human. The words of
these women have touched the
hearts of all who heard them and
inspired many to takeaction against
gross unfairness.

We’ve got cynicism.
Americans want change in gov-
ernment, and women in office may

Top 10 Reasons To
Vote Against President Bush

By Julian Kirtley

#10) He will overturn
. Roev. Wade. O.K:, weakest argu-
ment first. This isn’t a weak argu-
ment because there is a chance that
Bush won’toverturn Roe v. Wade;
he most definitely will. This is a
weak argument because between
20 and 35 percent of Americans,
(depending on who conducts the
poll), believe that this is a good
thing. True, most of these people
are misogynistic fundamentalists,
but unfortunately, they do vote. If
you are a member of this highly
vocal minority you might as well
quit reading now. None of my
other arguments are going to make
much sense to you either, as they
hinge on the philosophy that indi-
vidual freedom is actually a good
thing, and besides, I’m going to

use a few big words.

#9) Dan Quayle. Why
beat this dead horse? I'll tell you
why. The problem with Dan
Quayle is that he makes so‘many
bone-headed mistakes that people

accurately, that he is controlled by
dangerously right-wing elements
within our government. Quayle’s
main governmental function, aside
from presiding over a few badly
bungled NASA experiments, has
been his leadership of America’s
so called “Council on Competi-
tiveness”. The sole function of this

organization is to lobby against.

environmental protection. Iknow,
it’s hard to believe, butcheck it out
for yourself. Bush, like everyone
else, knows that Quayle is a bozo,
but he believes that dumping him
from the ticket now would just be
admitting that the first presidential
decision he made, the choice of a
running mate, was one of the worst
decisionsever made by aU.S. presi-
dent, so Quayle stays on. Quayle
jokes aside, if Bush is re-elected,
Quayle will be one irregular heart-
beat away from the power to de-
stroy the world. Scary monsters,
boys and girls.

#8) Bush is a Political
Sleaze-Ball.

This man, who in -

be change enough for many to re-
gain confidence in institutions
riddled with scandal and petty poli-
tics. Men and women alike want
America out of debt, out of inter-
national disgrace, and-into secure
Standing as a great nation. For
two-hundred years we’ve given
men a chance to form the politics
of the nation; now it is the turn of
women. Seventy years after a suc-
cessful fight for the vote, women
are fighting for heretofore unfath-
omable opportunity in government.

Most importantly, we’ve
got enthusiasm. As the number of
women in local and state politics
increases, the number of political
role models for young women in-
creases. While some people may
think women are crazy to choose
to enter the vicious and sometimes
deadly arena of male politics, oth-

‘ers realize that new perspectives

and new voices are needed to keep
politics vital.

The trick of 1992 will be
to maintain momentum. We must
stretch “The Year of the Woman”
into “ The Decade of the Woman”
into “ The Century of the Woman”

.. until being a woman in govemn-
ment is no more surprising and
noteworthy than being a woman at
home, a woman in the boardroom,
a woman in the fields, or a woman
anywhere.

accuse Clinton of running an un-
fair campaign, rode into office on
the coat tails of Willie Horton. He
has his Lee Atwater or Mary
Matalin use vicious racist or sexist
attacks on his opposition, then per-
sonally disavows the attacks and
makes them say “sorry”. The next
day, another such attack comes
forth, and the cycle starts over
again. George Bush has vowed he
will say or do anything to get re-
elected. Does that mean he will
probably lie about taxes again?
You betcha. Bomb Iraq again?
You betcha. Ask for a campaign
contribution from personal friend
Deng Xiao-P’ing? Oops, I’m get-
ting ahead of myself.

#7) Bush is a Cold War-
rior. O.K., maybe Bush’s policies
had something to do with the col-
lapse of European communism and
maybe they didn’t. The fact of the
matter is that the end of the cold
war caught Bush totally off guard.

an “effort to create and foster a
freshman experience that is un-

with another year of living on a

still agree, and I find myself
strangely thankful for the endur-
ing attitude of the College regard-
ing the freshman experience.

Deep Thoughts... By Kirby Shealy

In light of last year’s up-
roarious episodes of rightcous in-
dignation from week to week in
this, the South’s foremost college
weekly, I have decided to write a
column which refuses to get caught
up in the surging emotions of this
campus. We Davidsonians are a
most opinionated lot and we tend
to get right upset when one of our
fold turns his or her attacks toward
some idea or cause that we hold
Close to our hearts. By the third or
fourth week of school, Davidson
will become “The World” to all of
us (perhaps because we don’t read
the paper or watch the news nearly
enough). Little things that merely
inconvenience us now— the new
alcohol policy, nothaving a shuttle
service to and from the apartments

every fifteen minutes, etc._— will,
in a matter of weeks, swell into the
most traumatic and heinous crimes
against humanity in the history of
the planet. ~

Very few of us really |
know what living in the real world
is like. Unless you have spentsome
time abroad or you have lived on
your own during the summer, you
haven’t quite tasted true indepen-
dence. What I mean to say is that
you haven’t truly been tested as a
human being unless you have to
find your way from the subway
Station to your hotel in a country .
where the people don’t speak your
language and everyonearound you
looks like they’d kill you as soon
