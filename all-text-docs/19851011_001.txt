Police close party to prevent damages

By DAVID WILLIAMS

What began as an “excellent”
semi-formal in the Chambers Gal-
lery last Saturday night had, by
early Sunday morning, turned into
a small nightmare for the women
of Rusk House.

Campus Police Officer Ray
Thrower, hired by Rusk House to
patrol the party, said that at about
1:05 a.m. he “noticed that the
crowd was getting a little rowdy.”
He said: “There was quite a bit of
alcohol consumed; much was on
the floor.”

Thrower called Sergeant
Wayne King to the scene and dur-
ing this time “a fight broke out.
Officer King and I considered it a
real fight. We asked [the two men
involved in the fight] to quit. They
would not. We pulled them
apart.”

For five minutes King and
Thrower analyzed the situation
and decided to close the party.
“The main reason we closed it
down was that we feared that
someone would get hurt,”
Thrower said. He added: “Two or
three tables were torn up. If we
could keep anything else from get-
ting damaged, we would.”

Paintings by Art Professor
Herb Jackson, some of which had
been valued at over $17,000, were
also hanging in the gallery during
the party, and police feared that
the paintings could be damaged.

Members of Rusk House were
then mystified when, according to
Rusk Social Chairman Fran
Houck, Officer Thrower “turned
on the lights and told everyone to
leave. He asked the band to leave.
He told me _ that [President]
Kuykendall was on his way” to the
gallery. “We thought it was un-
necessary to wake him up,”
Houck said.

Thrower defended his action
of bringing Kuykendall to the
scene. “I felt like the members of
Rusk House did an excellent job
as far as overall security and pro-
tecting the paintings,” he said.
“But standard operating proce-

dure when something like this
happens is to notify the Dean’s
Office. We could not get a hold of
Dean Terry or the two other
deans. At the last point, we called
President Kuykendall.”

Another reason that Thrower
and King called Kuykendall,
Thrower said, was that: “We
couldn’t get the students to leave.
We needed someone to help clear
them out.” Thrower added that he
and King spent nearly twenty mi-
nutes clearing students from the
building.

Approximately five persons
were present in the Gallery when
Kuykendall came to the scene.
“When he arrived, there was noth-
ing but a sticky floor,” Houck
said.

The main reason we
closed it down was that
we feared someone
would get hurt.

While Kuykendall was look-
ing at the condition of the gallery,
someone reported to Thrower and
King that King’s Cushman Police
Scooter, which was parked di-
rectly in front of Chambers, had
been turned on its side.

It was first reported that sev-
eral thousand dollars damage had
been done to the Cushman. How-
ever, Campus Police indicated
later that damage was estimated at
around $50. Rusk House has of-
fered to assume responsibility for
the costs of repairing the
Cushman. However, Rusk is ask-
ing that those who are responsible
for damaging the Cushman turn
themselves in to the police.

Rusk President Lisa McNeilly
said: “I have no intention of sec-
ond-guessing the police. I ap-
preciate their efforts to keep the
party under control. [Closing
down] the party was what they

judged to be necessary.”

McNeilly stated that she wrote
a letter on behalf of Rusk House to
President Kuykendall, which
apologized to the president for
being awakened because of the in-
cident. “The letter was on his desk
by 8:30 Monday morning.”

McNeilly also expressed that
Jackson’s paintings were being
carefully guarded during the
party. “We hired students to
watch the paintings for | heur and
1-1/2 hour shifts. Also, we kept
tables between the paintings and
the crowd.”

McNeilly emphasized that
Rusk had been looking for a place
off campus to hold the semi-for-
mal, which could not be held in-
side the Rusk House because of
the size of the expected atten-
dence. “Dean Terry suggested

that we have i it om. campus, and we |

talked over his suggestion.” Other
alternatives for the location of the
party were Vail Commons,
Johnston Gym, and the Tennis
Center. “Perhaps if we had had it
in the Commons, this [incident]

wouldn’t have happened,”
McNeilly said. According to
McNeilly, however, the Com-

mons requires organizations hav-
ing parties at the Commons to at-
tend and pay for a 7:30 p.m. sea-
ted dinner, “and our social budget
could not afford it.”

Dean of Students Will Terry
issued the following statement
concerning the incident on Tues-
day:

“There are people on the cam-
pus who are always looking for
reasons to condemn student be-
havior, particularly their social
life, and who wish to make more
of such an occasion as the Rusk
party than it deserves. I regret, if
for no other reason than that it is
grist for that mill, that the party
degenerated at the end of the eve-
ning.

“Tam sorry the President had
to be called since I was out of town
and could not be reached. Security
believed the mood of the party

was changing, and that led them to
believe that an administrative pre-
sence was desirable. I will not sec-
ond-guess them because I have
great confidence in Officers
Thrower and King and believe
they acted in the best interests of
the students in closing down the
party and calling the President. It
is always a severe disappointment
when certain Davidson students
do not conform to their usual good
judgment and reasonable standard
of behavior.

“My impression is there was
not enough effort made to control
the serving of alcohol and that is a
serious omission that led to the de-

terioration of what had been a fun
party. Students must accept more
responsibility in this area. We
cannot tolerate situations where
the safety of individuals and prop-
erty can be threatened because of
lack of control.

“I would like very much to
have the names of those students
whe were rude to security, those
who were fighting and those who
refused to follow the request of
Messrs. Thrower and King. It
should be clear that the gallery
will not be used for any but the
most sedate affairs in the future,
and evidently the Rusk formal is
not a sedate affair.”

Freshman Beth Drummond is surprised by a roving
reporter.
