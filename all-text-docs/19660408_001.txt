Due to the recent ‘‘brown-bag-
ging” haggle in Charlotte a
stricter crackdown of liquor law
enforcement could hamper off-
campus alter parties during
Spring Frolics.

A decision handed down by
Mecklenburg Recording Court
Judge William T. Grist on March
22, stated that any consumption
of alcohol in a club — public or
private — is illegal.

This decision prohibits ‘“brown-

concealed in any way, into an
establishment as well as ruling
out any locker system in which
a ‘“‘member”’ stores his liquor at
a public place for his own con-
sumption.

The decision, backed up by a
statement issued from State As-
sistant Attorney General James
F. Bullock. is based on several
antiquated liquor laws still on
the North Carolina law books.

According to these laws, the
1923 Turlington Act, revised by

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., FRIDAY, APRIL 8, 1966

the 1947 ABC Act, liquor must
be bought at ABC stores, trans-
ported to one’s home with its
seal intact and consumed or
served there.

In its application to Davidson,
the law leaves little opportunity
for students to drink legally.

According to one officer of the
Mecklenburg County Police
force, ‘‘home’’ for the college
student would be his dorm room,
and drinking in dormitories is
prohibited by a faculty regula-
tion.

The county police officer also
stated that “any liquor stored
in one’s automobile, in the trunk
or elsewhere, whether the seal
is broken or intact, is also illegal
according to North Carolina state
law.”

There will be no strict crack-
down on. the liquor laws “in the
very near future,” oné member
of the local ABC law enforce-
ment staff told THE DAVIDSON-
IAN. He went on to say that ‘‘the
statement concerning a stricter
enforcement was an opinion of

the attorney general.

‘However, what has been con-
sidered legal for years will not
be changed without giving the
public adequate advance notice
in local news media.’

Little resistance to any drink-
ing at fraternity parties is to be
expected from owners of places
where parties are usually held.

Hattie Morgan, owner of Hat-
tie’s Cabin, stated that ‘‘It will
be a private party and up to the
individuals involved. I'll take
steps at my place of business to

enforee the liquor laws, but not
at private parties.”

One administration official at
Davidson told THE DAVIDSON-
IAN that “‘as long as parties are
kept under control, they pro-
bably won't be raided. If people
are discreet, nothing will be done
by any law officers.”

He went on to say that ‘‘under
present faculty rules, it is un-
likely that anyone will be sus-
pended from school if someone
is caught drinking at an after-

party, unless he is ao an
extremely ungentlemanly man-
ner.”

Bil! Bondurant, college attor-
ney, reported that rarely does
any big trouble occur during
dance weekends. ‘Usually, only
one or two students are stopped
during a dance weekend, and
those for relatively minor of-
fenses.”

According to the AUC enforce-
ment officer, any future crack-
downs will be carried out by

Knox said that since there are

Recommendation Asks

A Complete Abolishment

The faculty, in action at its monthly meeting Tues-
day left standing until May a proposal by Davidson's
Religious Life Committee to abolish required Vespers.

According to Dean of Faculty Frontis Johnston, the
postponement was due to a faculty practice concerning
policy matters, whereby the faculty has to be informed
48 hours ahead of time “to give them the opportunity to
think it over and study it.” To have acted immediately
on the issue, said Johnston, “would have been con-

' trary ito both practice and the Committee’s expecta-
tions.’

In addition, Johnston announced to the faculty a pro-
gram to study and revise the entire curriculum at Dav-

‘TOTALITY OF DAVIDSON LIFE’

Committee Challenges Fraternities

By KERN PARKER
Davidsonian Asst. Managing
Editor

The Social Life Evaluation
Committee this week issued a
report challenging Davidson fra-
ternities to “redefine their very
nature, ‘‘broaden their scope,”
and become more conscious of
their responsibilities.

The committee presented the
report in response to its instruc-
tion to “state what role is ex-
pected of fraternities and other
social clubs on the Davidson
campus.”

With this statement the com-
mittee essentialy completed its
task of analyzing and evaluating
Davidson social life. It had pre-
viously presented a set of recom-
mendations for rush, among
them 100 per cent affiliation,
second semester rush, and re-
quired freshmen eating in the
College Union cafeteria for the
entire school year, which were
adopted by the faculty in late
February.

SOCIAL SYSTEM

In its latest report the evalua-
tion group stressed that it was
necessary to consider Davidson's
social system not separately, but
in its relation to campus life as
a whole: “concern for the to-
tality of Davidson life’ must be
the background and ultimate

concern in a discussion of any
one aspect of that life.

After establishing this back-
ground, the report deals with
problems centering in two ma-
jor areas, ‘‘frequently labeled
with the emotionally charged
terms ‘rejection’ and ‘antl-in-
tellectualism’ but more simply
and objectively viewed in terms
of the lives of students who are
so included.”

In dealing with the first of
these problems the committee
agreed that ‘‘the college's aban-
donment to fraternities of re-
sponsibility for many areas of
campus life has shown little con-
cern for the well-being of these
students who are not fraternity
members.”’

RESPONSIBILITY

They further agree that the
college has a responsibility to
each of its students, and should
offer them opportunities for full
participation in the life of the
campus. They assert that the
fraternity system, although au-
tomonous in many respects, ex-
ists on campus by invitation of
the college and become a part of
the structure of the college. Thus
the fraternity system shares the
responsibility of the college to
its students.

Because of these considera-
tions the committee ‘feels little

reluctance in asking (of the
fraternities) that they collective-
ly find ways of providing to any
student who may desire them,
many of the opportunities which
they offer.

EATING CLUBS

The committee adds that it
does not expect ‘“‘to hold fra-
ternities solely responsible for
the welfare of all students’;
along this line of thought it ad-
vocates a study of the uses and
potentialities of the College
Union, with particular emphasis
on the responsibility of the
Union to the students who eat
there. It also recommends the
addition on campus of open-
membership eating clubs.

The report emphasizes that
such changes as eating clubs,
“designed to make the externals
of existence of those not invited
into the fraternity systems, will
be effective only if accompa-
nied by a change of attitude by
the fraternities."

The committee expresses the
hope that the fraternities will
‘learn to see in individuals po-
tentials which may often be
overlooked because of present
criteria of acceptance." The
members of the group feel that

the individual students, the fra-,

ternity system itself, and the
college as a whole would benefit

by such a change of attitude.
SECOND PROBLEM

In dealing with the second
problem, the effect of fraterni-
ties on students who are in-
volved in the system, the com-
mittee admits the ‘‘impossibility
of isolating fraternity member-
ship as a contributing factor to
undesirable aspects of the ethics
of students.”

The report adds, however, that
“the effect of the interaction
of the individuals making up a
given fraternity may often be to
reinforce and intensify certain
value patterns which are, of
course, not peculiar to fraternity
members.”

The committee emphasizes
that it is not attempting “to
lay on fraternities the major
share of blame for observed dis-
crepancies between student
values and those values which
should be fostered at a college
such as Davidson.”

CORRECTION

“Insofar as such discrepancies
do occur,” the report continues,
“the blame can undoubtedly be
widely distributed. We are in-
terested, however, not in blame,
but in correction—and here fra-
ternities and other student
groups can play a_ significant
role.”

The committee sees the idea!

role of the fraternity system in
this context of increased par-
ticipation in campus life.

They recognize as valuable the
present contributions of the fra-
ternity system (organized so-
cial life, advantage of close as-
sociation with others, opportu-
nities for leadership and develop-
ing a sense of responsibility to
others), but they ask the fra-
ternities to go beyond these con-
tributions.

PARTICIPATION

They ask that fraternities
think of themselves as part of
the structure of the Davidson
community, not as social or-
ganizations apart from that com-
munity. The report lays particu-
lar stress on increased fraternity
participation in the academic
life of the college by such meth-
ods as encouraging participation
in worthwhile extra-curricular
activities, in sponsoring .speak-
ers or discussions, and the like.

The evaluation group recom-
mends that the fraternities
choose their policies on the basis
of what will be beneficial to the
college as a whole, not to the
fraternity system alone.

OBLIGATION .

For, the report continues, the
fraternities are ultimately a part
of the college. Because of this
fact, the committee feels no

reluctance in asking them to
‘broaden their scope” and ‘‘to
relinquish some of their long-
standing rights of selection.”

The fraternity system, as an
integral part of the college com-
munity, shares in the obliga-
tion to improve the quality of
campus life and has the respon-
sibility to help realize the col-
lege’s goal of ‘nurturing the
whole man."

The committee members con-
cluded their report with the
statement; ‘‘All we can do is ex-
press our belief that fraternities
and the College are not foes,
and that fraternities can make
even more important contribu-
butions in the future than they
have in the past.”

EPES’ COMMENTS

Professor H. M. Epes, a mem-
ber of the group, called the re-
port “‘more a guideline than a
specific proposal.”

“At present we're just experi-
menting,” he said. “We're ex-
tending these genera] ideas to
the fraternities and are going to
see what they can come up
with.”

‘We believe that actions along
the lines we have suggested will
be of benefit both to the college
and the fraternities themselves,
Epes concluded.

Mike Harrington: who served
as associate editor on the 1965-
66 DAVIDSONIAN staff will

der of the year.

out the best DAVIDSONIAN yet.
Several members will be work-
ing on newspapers this summer,

will be invaluable next year.”

with him at its next meet-
ing May 3.

The Religious Life Commit-
tee’s report, as well. as calling
for the cessation of vespers, sug-
gested in two appendices several
ways of “maintaining tangible
expressions of Davidson's com-
mitment as a Christian college."’

“The committee has come re-
luctantly to the conclusion that
vespers is not accomplishing the
purpose for which it was origin-
ally intended,’ reads the re-
port. “Vespers does not have
the support of students,” and
it is no longer ‘‘a genuine ex-
pression of Christian commit
ment on the part of the indi-
vidual or the institution.”

To maintain Davidson's com-
mitment, the committee recom-
mended: (1) continued and im-
proved ‘‘weekly chapel pro-
grams centering on religious
themes,”’ (2) a restructure- of
“the organizational! pattern for
the implementation of the re-
ligious program of Davidson."
and (3) more ‘‘voluntary pro-
grams of religious activities”
supervised by a Committee of
Religious Policy and a Commit-
tee of Religious Program and
Activity.

The committee's resolution
reads: ‘'That compulsory ves-
per services cease at the end
of this academic year and that
a comprehensive program of
religious activities as suggested
in this report become the ex-
pression of Davidson's Christian
commitment.”

Although he hinted at ‘‘sig-
nificant changes in curriculum,”
Johnston said that he didn’t
“have a particular goal in mind.
We'll start from scratch, re-
study the whole program, and
devise what seems to be more
up-to-date and desirable. I don't
have any details as yet. but
eventually it will be a major
consideration for the College."

In other business, the faculty
granted Saturday. April 16, as
a holiday; voted on honorary
degrees; and heard a report
concerning the trustee commit-
tee on revision of trustee by-
laws.

Faculty Suspends
Classes For Frolies

Classes will be suspended next
Saturday during Spring Frolics,
as the faculty approved Tuesday
an earlier proposal by the Aca-
demic Scheduling Committee.

The action came as a result
of a student-directed move to

equalize the number of Monday-
Wednesday-Friday and Tuesday-
Thursday-Saturday classes.

The Committee had earlier

scheduled 46 TTS classes, to only
45 for MWF.
