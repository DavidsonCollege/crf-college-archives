WHAT PRICE GLORY?

As Basketball, Swimming, and Wrestling enter the home
stretch, and as the first faint indications that there will be
spring bring thoughts of baseball and track, a certain core of
athletes are engaging in spring? football practice.

With nothing more exciting than an intersquad game to
spur the activity, it is hard to generate a great deal of en-
thusiasm for this period of drudgery. Yet each of the footbal!
participants displays an unusual dedication. to his task. It has,
been brought forcefully to his attention that this is the all im-|
portant period that will determine the results come next fall.

Blocking, tackling, and timing are garnered in these ses-
sions that will pay off in touchdowns and victories next season. |
And with the fall session a short time of preparation at best, |
these men realize that outstanding performances now will tag
them as worthy of starting positions during the season.

Beyond the sharp thuds of bodies making contact, beyond
the sweat and toil of this time of training stands a vision that
each player holds before him at all times, a vision that con-
stantly reminds him that those that are to gain the glory must
pay the price.

TATUM’S TACTICS

Jim Tatum and his big move to UNC took the emphasis
of sport’s pages from basketball here in the Carolinas for a
few days. Enthusiastic Carolina alumni were excited as they
featured their Alma Mater once again becoming a national
football power. This conception was not shattered by Tatum
when he said in a statement that was later qualified, “Winning
is not just important. It’s everything.”

As his long awaited return to the scene of his own under-
graduate days became a fact, the Maryland “Diamondback”
was not as disturbed as one might imagine. ‘“‘We do not feel
his leaving means the end of the University of Maryland.
Rather it may be a second beginning. It may mean a pause in
athletics which will give us time to develop more of the
academic fundamentals for which the university exists.’ The
Tatum era was one “in which our accreditation was partially
threatened because of an overemphasis on athletic scholar-
ships.”

At the receiving end the “Daily Tar Heel’ hardly wel-
comed him with open arms, “Let's not think either that it will
fail to take its toll on the academic health of the school. Let’s
not believe that Jim Tatum . . . will play the game any more
for the old college try here than he did at Maryland. He will
play to win and win alone.”

The subject of all these spontaneous outbursts of criti-
cism, which even reached “Time’’ magazine, was unusually
noncommittal until the proper moment. When the co-editors
of the “Tar Heel” were on the verge of losing their positions
to a student petition, Tatum gained prestige and a tactical vic-
tory by defending their right to voice their opinions and re-
questing the petition to be withdrawn.

No matter how you view Tatum and the type athletic
regime that he embodies, (personally I am very happy that
we are removed from the remotest danger of athletics domi-
nating the college picture) it must be admitted that in all his
years of utilizing strategy to gain victories, this one move may
have been his most influential and timely.

Coach Clements announced
this week that equipment will
be issued for baseball practice
on Monday, Feb. 20. All men
who are not excused for par-
ticipation in another sport at
this time are expected to re-

drills, Captain Billy Morris
will conduct the opening drills.
Conditioning, light batting
practice, and fielding funda-
mentals will be stressed in
these early workouts.
Prospects are bright for a
repeat performance of last
year’s fine record. The infield
remains intact, the outfield
is almost the same, and only
the pitching staff builds anew.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 10. 1956

The most colorful and probably |
| the best basketball team seen here
in the past four years edges toward
the end of the season with two big
games here tonight and Saturday

night. The Generals of Washington
| and Lee perform on the local hard-
| woods tonight at 8:15 as the Cats

an improved squad in to attempt to
turn the tables on last time’s 93-70
defeat

In W&L Davidson meets a team
that has the nucleus of an outstand-
ing unit but their schedule has
produced few victories. Coach
Scott: termed their victory over the
Generals the best game of the year
for the Cats. It will take an equal-
ly bright performance to duplicate
the feat. The hopes of a good po-
sition in the tournament are riding
on the outcome of this event, along
with the V. M I. and W. & M
games which are to wind up the
season.

College of Charleston represents
one of Davidson's easiest victories
of the year, but all indications are

that they are fielding an almost
entirely new starting outfit ‘and
should give a much better battle.

This game, which will be preceeded

by Jayvees, will be the next to last
appearance of the Cats in Johns-
ton gym this year

After apparently snapping their

lethargy, a natural result of a busy
season and exams, against Guilford
last Tuesday, the Cats should be
ready to head down the home
stretch and hit the tournament
with the idea of making more than
a token appearance

On the third of
Wildcats of Davidson
Tribe of William and Mary and
were defeated 85-75. The Cats
started very slowly and missed a
lot of shots. Meanwhile William
and Mary was blistering the nets,
and after 5 minutes the score was
22-9 in favor of the Tribe. Hobby
Cobb. hit three straight, Richard
Weeks three, and Joe Milner one
to bring the score to 29-23, the
closest the Cats ever got. William
and Mary still ripped the nets and
at the end of the half the score
was 47-29, The Cats were kept alive
in the first half by the dead-eye
shooting of Richard Weeks, who
dropped in 12 points in that period
The red-hot club of W & M had
a 52.3 field goal percentage in
comparison to 37.1 of Davidson. In
the second half, the Wildcat hard
wooders made numerous floor mis
takes, and with 8 minutes and 30
seconds gone they were behind
69-49. Big Dave Hollingsworth dis

afternoon and Emory will do the

place on campus. Once again,
Coach Carroll Hambright who. has
to divide his time between foot-
ball and the tankmen, has come
up with a winning aggregation,
Although the squad has exper-
ienced a somewhat up and down
season, individual performers have
been brilliant. Tommy Rivers and
Ed Spiers have dominated the 50
and 100 yard dash events, with
Rivers setting a new pool record.
Bill Carrell has also set a new re-
cord, flashing the 200 individual
medley in 2 minutes, 31 seconds.
Lack of depth has hurt the record
of this year’s squad (as compared
with the brilliant 7-2 last season).
But there are promising frosh in
the present setup that should be
ready to fill in admirably next
season. Coach Hambright asserts
that “the entire team has done a
fine job and we hope to finish the

TOMMY RIVERS, WILDCAT OF WEEK

By CHARLES McGOWAN

The sports staff pays tribute
this week to Tommy Rivers, who
has: done an outstanding job for
the “Catfish” this season. Rivers
was not picked beeause of an out-
standing performance last week,
but because of outstanding — per-
formances throughout the entire
season

The most amazing thing about

Rivers is that he came to’ Davidson
without any competitive experi-
ence at all, but yet he was a steady
point-getter from the very begin-
ing of his freshman year. Coach
Hambright says that Rivers is the
most consistent man that. he has
in that he exeells in many differ-
ent events and can always be de-
pended upon for points

Hard work, a strong desire to
better himself, and the will to
win characterize Rivers. He exem-
plified all these characteristics in
the Citadel meet in which he swam
the last leg of the 400 yard free
relay. When Rivers entered the
water his opponent already had a
one-third length lead on him, but
he caught his opponent and passed
him in a truly remarkable effort
to win. He displayed these same
characteristics in a similar per-
formanee at Washington and Lee
later in the season.

Not only has Rivers been a con-
sistant poeint-getter, but he has
broken the record for the 100
yard dash twice during the season.
He broke Speir’s record of 56.3 sec.
and Citadel when he splashed the
100 in 56.2 sec. In the meet with

TOMMY RIVERS

V. M. I, Rivers broke his
record by whipping away the 100
in 55.8 sec. Hambright says that
