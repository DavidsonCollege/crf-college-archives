Special Opportunities for
History Study at Oxford

Degree Awarded in One Subject
—Not in Several Different
Courses

No American student who has found
the study of history attractive and who
feels inclined to “specialize” in it ought
to fail to learn something of how history
is and may be studied at Oxford. Such
information should go far to confirm -his
decision about a specialty and to cause him
to reaize the desirability, either through
a Rhodes Scholarship or otherwise, of
pursuing this specialty at Oxford. The
American student knows, or soon learns,
that the normal thing is to aim at the
B.A, degree and that the B.A. degree is
awarded at Oxford in one definite sub-
ject, instead of resulting from the com-
pletion of a certain number of “courses.”
The student of history, therefore, in a
majority of cases, will seek his B.A. in
the Honour School of Modern History;
and a graduate of an American university
need have no fear that he will duplicate
things which he has already “had.”

The Rhodes Scholar as a rule may ex-
pect to receive Senior standing. With
this standing, he is not obliged to pass
any entrance or intermediate examina-
tions. He may thus begin at once his
studies for the final examinations, or
“schools,” working, with the guidance of
his tutor, along lines determined by stat-
ute and by regulations of the board of the
faculty of modern history.

The basis of the study is dual. The
student must give his primary attention
to the History of England and to General
History. The difference is that all of the
former must be studied, whereas, in the
case of General History, special knowl-
edge is demanded of only a relatively
short period. This arrangement appears
based on the principle that all of a thing
should be mastered where circumstances
permit, but that, where from the nature
of the case this is less possible, mastery
of a part is better than superficial knowl-
edge of the whole. In addition to this,
the wide choice possible in the matter of
a period allow the student to consult his
special interest. The earliest, and one of
the longest, of the periods is 285-604.
The last, 1789-1878, is the shortest and
also the most popular. In the case of the
History of England, there is a dual sub-
division. The continuous Constitutional
History of England to the present day
must be studied, careful “attention being
given to documents and a knowledge of
Constitutional Law being also required.
The continuous Political History to 1885
must also be studied; and again room is
given for the special interest of the stu-
dent, this time by the requirement that
proficiency must be shown in some aspect
of Political History such as biography of

statesmen, literature or art, religious
movements, foreign relations, and the
like.

The study of English and General His-
tory must be supplemented in the first
place by a knowledge of political and de-
scriptive geography and in the second, in
the case of those who seek the highest
honors, by a careful study, with reference
to original authorities, of a special sub-
ject. The latter requirements is still an-
other case of opportunity for the student
to consult his special interest. There is
a list of a dozen or more of these special
subjects, and it is even possible to secure
consent for the study of a subject sug-
gested by the student. The American
student may well be interested in the
American Revolution and the Reformation
of the Federal Constitution 1760-1788, onc
of the listed subjects. Others, picked at
random, are St. Augustine, the Crusades,
the Italian Renaissance, British Colonial
Policy 1830-1858, Political Economy, and
Representative Government.

Finally, in addition to the above men-
tioned subjects, a study must be made of
Political Science and of Economic His-
tory with Economic Theory, though those
who do not aim at the highest honors may
omit one or the other. In the last place,
if a student knows well French, German,
Italian or Spanish, he may have an op-
portunity of displaying his proficiency
and of receiving credit for it. :

The School of Modern History has at
Oxford perhaps the best established tra-
dition after “Greats” (Classics). It of-
fers opportunity of an excellent general
education .which should appeal not only to
the specialist in history but to those in-
terested in public affairs, politics, eco-
nomics and the like.

The Rhodes Scholar with Senior stand-
ing may well “do schools” at the end of
two years. He may then in his third
year decide on one of. several courses
open to him, of which special mention
may be made of the B.Litt. Degree. This

‘is a research degree which makes it pos-
sible for a Rhodes Scholar to undertake
research into some question in which he
may become interested. If he can in-
corporate the results of his study into a
satisfactory thesis, he will receive the

National Volunteer
Band Meets In Mich.

Glenn Fry Made Member of Na-
tional Council of Student
Volunteer Movement

Glenn Fry, representing the North
Carolina Student Volunteer Union, be-
came a member of the National Council
of the Student Volunteer Movement at a
recent meeting of that council.

The council met in Kalamazoo, Mich.,
jointly with the National Council of the

Student Christian Associations, being
guests of Kalamazoo College. The gath-
ering was royally entertained in the

Michigan city of celery and pop-corn.

The problem of greatest concern to the
council was the “toboggan slide” decrease
since 1920 of those students in American
colleges who volunteer for service on the
foreign mission field. To this situation all
the efforts of the council were directed.

The wording of the declaration card
was changed from “It is my purpose if
God permit, to become a foreign mission-
ary,” to “It is my purpose if God permit,
to become a Christian missionary abroad.”
After years of dissatisfaction the new
term brings a richness of meaning to the
statement of purpose.

The educational policy has been chang-
ed and a miracle has been accomplished in
the union of the movement with the Y.
M. and Y. W. in a combined program of
Christian world education. Together they
made a searching analysis of the approach
to student thinking.

The conclusion reached was that stu-
dents are seeing America as a non-Chris-
tian country and that the other nations in
their development show that they do not
need a new religion. They are asking,
“Would Ghandi be a better man if he
were a Christian?” So all three move-
ments are uniting to teach students the
worthwhileness of the Christian message
and the missionary enterprise.

All reports seem to vertify the fact that
a new antl vital religious genius has seized
these’student movements. In these days
when the scientific attitude of seeking
God at the end of the microscope holds
sway, the International Missionary Coun-
cil went back to Jerusalem to Jesus and
found for us a striking and convincing
statement of the Christian message. Many
Christians view this meeting as having as
much significance in the religious world
as. the League of Nations in the political
world. It means that a new day has come
in student religious attitudes when a
crowd can be gathered on a hill overlook-
ing Kalamazoo and read together the first
four chapters of the Acts in a quest for
the meaning of the “Experience
Power.”

methods now proposed to accomplish the

first aim named is to create a more rev-
erent personal attitude in the student
toward the morning devotional by making
him feel that he has a real part in it.
There will be an attempt to get closer
relations between faculty and students by
urging a good attendance of the faculty
each morning. (It was suggested in stu-
dent discussion of the proposed petition
that the faculty would attend more fully
for the purpose of observing results of
the new method).

The members of the “Y” cabinet will,
from this date until Christmas, be in di-
rect control of the period. One member
will serve each week, and be responsible
for a different chapel leader each day dur-

degree. Other Rhodes Scholars will- take
the full three years for “schools;’’ but
“schools” will be and ought to be the
aim of the great majority.. In a few spe-
cial cases, the D.Phil. degree offers op-
pottunity for advanced research. It is
in general necessary to put in all three
years in order to obtain the degree. The
applicant is likely to meet with effective
discouragement unless he has a definite
course of study in mind; and he is in a
much better position if he has already
begun work on it.

Rhodes Scholarships are, of course,
open for any. field of study offered at the
University of Oxford, and are tenable
for three years. Men who are between
the ages of 19 and 25 and who have
reached their Sophomore year in college,
may, at their convenience, apply either in
the state in which they reside or in the
state in which they attend college. A per-
sonal interview with a committee of selec-
tion is necessary, but no examination is
required. Since there are but 32 appoint-
ments annually, each state holds an elec-
tion two years out,of three. © Anyone who
is interested may obtain further infor-
mation from their college or from the
American Secretary to the Rhodes Trus-
tees, Frank Aydelotte, president of

Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Penna.

CHAMBERS BUILDING
NEARING COMPLETION

Working a crew of more than 50 men,
several of whom were Davidson students, ;
Blythe & Isenhour, general contractors of
Charlotte, who have built Watts, East |
and West dormitories as well as the right
wing of Chambers, have pushed the con- |
struction work forward on the new left |
wing and center from the excavation work |
that presented itself at the close of school |
to the present point of construction.

In the left wing all the concrete has |
been poured for the three floors, the work-
men are now completing thi$ proces on
the .roof; the floor struts are being put |
down, the tile walis that break the build- |
ing up into rooms are being put up, and |
the basement is being cleared for con-
crete. This wing when completed will |
house some of the overflow from the
completed right wing, all the sciences with '
the exception of Chemistry, and a few of |
the classes that due to the present lack of |
room have beén forced to use temporary |
quarters, |

The work on the center has not prog: |
ressed so rapidly but steelis on hand for |
the roof and soon the concrete work will |
be started again in this, section in_prepara- |
tion for the roof. The center when ‘com- |
pleted will contain a large dining reom |
for alumni receptions and other gather-
ings and the auditorium. The seating ca- |
pacity of the latter will be around 1,200
and if the present plans of Dr, Martin are |
carried out a very fine pipeorgan will be |
a part of the equipment that he is buying |

pleted wing. |

Although the outside work will soon be |
completed and the building from the ex- |
terior will appear completed, a great deal
of interior work will have to be done be-
fore the building is complete. To quote
the contractor, “This will take the time.”
However, making due allowance for de-
lays, it is hoped that the New Chambers,

c
heart and core of Davidson, will be ready

at this time for the center and uncom- |:

Interest Shown In

R. O. T. C. By Cadets

R. O. T. C. Pointing For Fourth

Successive of Distinguished
Rating

Davidson is looking forward to a

| good and successful year for military

training in 1928-29. For the past three
years the local unit has won distin-
guished rating. As this is the highest
honor that the War Department can
confer upon a military organization,
students have become intensely inter-
ested in obtaining a very high degree
of efficiency in military science.

There have been increased efforts to
induce every student to take pride in
their respective organizations and to
have some interest and earnestness in
their R. O. T. C. work during the
year.

The new cadet captains in each com-
pany for the coming term are as fol-
lows:

Company A—R. O. Glynn.

Company B—W. C. Archie.

Company C—R. M. Gant.

Company D—W. M Regen.

In order to have a successful and
most profitable year in’ military tac-
tacs, co-operation of each student is
required, and it is only with this co-
operation that Davidson will win dis-
tinguished rating again this year.

FINISHING TOUCHES
MADE ON FRAT COURT

With the finishing touches being put
on the fraternity court this week the
houses located there will be complete.
They have been externally complete
\from the beginning of school, but due
‘to delay in shipping of hardware it
_was only the first of this week that all
of the inside fittings were put in.
There still remains quite a bit of
work to be done to the grounds sur-
rounding the court, such as grading
the grounds and planting grass seed so
that there will a luxuriant sod there
next fall. Work on the court was be-
gun last spring around commencement
time and many predicted that the
houses would never be ready in time

Synod To Meet For

Discussion of Plans

In a statement made in the latest
Christian Observer Dr. Wm. J. Mar-
tin, president of the college, announced
that a meeting for the Synod of North
Carolina would be held at the First
Presbyterian Church, in Greensboro,
tomorrow, September 28, Thé purpose
of the meeting is to discuss the prob-
lems of the church education and
schools in the state and to study the
report of Dr. Brown, who has been
working under Dr. Henry H. Sweets.

The meeting is called’ at 10 o'clock,
a.m, Every one is invited to be pres-
ent who is in any way interested in
the church’s educational program.

for the opening of school.

The appearance of the court is much |
better than many had expected. . In |
| fact many of the ones who were op- |
|posed to the change last spring have
}expressed themselves as more than |
| satisfied with the situation as it now |
jis. The eleven houses are all of sim- |
ilar design, being colonial in style. |
The brick for the houses was chosen |
to harmonize with the brick in the |
New Chambers building, and
Richardson stadium. The houses have |
| slate roofs, which go well with the red |
!brick and the white woodwork on the |
outside. The inside walls are of terra
|cotta, with ivory finished woodwork. |
The floors are red oak, treated once |
with shellac and twice with wax.

Every house in the court varies in |
floor arrangement and general appear-

are heated by a.céntral heating plant
located under one of the houses. Three
face Stadium Drive and the other
eight are arranged in the shape of a
horseshoe with the end of the shoe
opening on Concord Avenue. A
crushed rock road runs in front of the
houses on the horseshoe and each
house is connected to the road by a
stone dust walk. The final plans of
the college include planting shrubbery

in between the houses and_ several
landscaping plans to beautify the
court,

tofore it has been necessary to de-

velop a bass player, this year there
even appears a candidate for this post.
A drum and bugle corps will be de-
veloped which will alternate with the
band on the weekly parades. In case
the number warrants, there may also
be a secondary band.
