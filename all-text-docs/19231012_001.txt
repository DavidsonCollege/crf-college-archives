AN EXCEPTIONAL EXAMPLE

Walt Holcombe Scores Teachings in
Modern Colleges

Preaching to an audience that filled
the large Wesley Memorial Tabernacle
in Atlanta to overflowing several weeks
ago, Walt Holcombe. widely known
Methodist evangelist, used the David-
faculty as an exceptional example
consecrated college instructors in
these days of arrogant and impious
denials of the divinity of Christ and of
the immortality of the soul.

Evangelist Holcombe had taken his
text from the second chapter of Revela-
tion, wherein the evils and dangers of
false teachings are emphasized. From
that he launched into his excoriation of
“those who claim to be teachers, preach-
ers and apostles in our country today.”

He referred several times to an ad-
vertisement which had previously
peared in an Atlanta paper over the
nature of Davidson College,
caption, “The Faith of Our

naire circulated among several thousand

Memorial to Former Chambers

The Executive Committee of the Board
of Trustees of Davidson College met at
Davidson, Tuesday, October 2d, and con-
vened in session from 9 a. m. to 1:30
p. m. Six of the eight members of the
board were present at the meeting.

The first action of the committee was
to hear the reports of Dr. W. J. Martin,
president of the college, and Mr. F. L.
Jackson, treasurer. The most interest-
ing item in the report of Mr. Jackson
was the announcement that $560,000 of
the present Six Hundred Thousand Dol-
lar Campaign had already been received
in pledges. The campaign officials have
their main headquarters in Atlanta at
the present time, and from that point
will cover Georgia.
