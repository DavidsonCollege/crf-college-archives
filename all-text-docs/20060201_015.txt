came ready to swim
fast. They were able to
meet the challenge and
claim a victory at the
end,” said Brad Poole

The teams earned 11 first place victories
on the road to their overall win. The women

decisive win over VMI.

“Our guys team was able to come out
strong and keep the momentum rolling to
claim a victory over VMI,” said Poole.

second, respectively, in the 200 fly.

With the help of teammates Robb
Broughton ’08 and Jamie Hopkins ’07,
Broughton and Stegger joined the 400 med-

ley in a first place finish.

“We had guys swimming in some events
that they wouldn’t normally swim and they
were able to find a way to get their hand on

the wall first,”
said Poole.
The men
swept the 200
breast, with
Wildcats plac-
ing in the top
three positions.

captured _ the
200 free with

able to pull it out in the end, which made for
an exciting finish,” said Brough.

last regular season meet Saturday at James
