Cars Everywhere, But None For Blacks

Recent controversy over a
student activities vehicle has
threatened to stir Davidson
from its long winter's nap of
complacency.

Many considered the role of
the Black Student Coalition as a
sign that the natives were
getting restless again.

The social life -of black
students has been the point of
stress in recent arguments,
discussions, and SGA meetings,
much to the chagrin of all
concerned.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Patterson

To the Editor:

The Patterson Court
Council's resolution concerning
the pledging activities of an off-

campus fraternity is
Capricious, arbitrary, and
discriminatory.

(1) The resolution is

capricjous. The Patterson Court
Couneil is a spontaneously
formed, voluntary asso-
ciation of individuals who
claim to represent their
respective eating clubs. As such
it has no duly promulgated
authority to impose fines on
eating clubs, let alone impose
restrictions on the activities of
off-campus fraternities.

The Council is not recognized
by, nor does it in any way derive
authority from, the Board of
Trustees.

And yet, via the proposal
made by Thompson Monday
night, the PCC has supposedly
conferred upon itself the power
of: (a) Acting as official
interpretor of the committee of
18 report; (b) Interpreting that
report and rendering policy
decisions on matters unrelated
to the report: (c) Imposing
fines and taking disciplinary
action against those eating
clubs which do not conform to
the will of the council ( i.e. Jim
Thompson has conferred upon
himself the power of judge.
jury, prosecutor and supreme
lawmaker in all matters related
to the social system).

(2) The resolution is
arbitrary. Thompson's
resolution states that an eating

club is responsible for the
actions of its members.
Consider the following

proposition. A Phi Gamm Self-
Selects Delt. Phi Gamma Delta
as an off-campus fraternity
pledges a freshman _ in
‘‘violation’’ of the PCC's
resolution. The Phi Delts are
subject to a $100 fine because a
Gamm eats at their house.

Consider the more general
arbitrariness of Thompson's
resolution which says that the
PCC can take disciplinary
action against any house which,
in the opinion of the PCC, does
not abide by the committee of 18
report.

Furthermore, a house can be
penalized if, in the eyes of Jim
Thompson, it does not concur
with the ‘‘general philosophy”
of the Council.

(3) The resolution is
discriminatory. The arbitrary
nature of the PCC’s resolution
opens the way for blatant
discrimination. According to
Thompson, if a member of a
fraternity which pledges
freshmen self-selects Emanon

of students to cars, blacks are
often left on campus, between
the rock and the hot place.

But there are other groups
which need, or could benefit
from, the proposed auto.

Foreign students need a car
to improve their social life.
Stoics, midgets, and
vegetarians would relish an
improved social life.

Ugly people need a better
social life. But various polimics
over who might use this car on
which weekends have
generated more heat than light

on the issues of a student car
purchase.

From dialogue so far, one
might think this car would be
the only one Davidson owns. It's
not. Cars of all shapes and
colors are in abundance here.

President Spencer drives a
new Chevrolet which the college
buys for him.

Mr. Cornell tools around in a
new yellow Ford, school-owned
of course. After balancing the
College budget this summer,
though, Mr. Cornell did buy a
Lincoln Continental of his own.

Court Council Hit
For Its Arbitrary Judgement

(Thompson's house), he
(Thompson) will not levy a fine

on Emanon since, in his
judgment, the dirty-rush-
fraternity-man would not

represent the general sentiment
at Emanon House (which in
Thompson's opinion is quite
positive).

In other words, Thompson is
not only the supreme
lawmaker, but he reserves the
right to enforce his. laws
selectively (i.e. dump on those
houses he doesn't like, e.g.
Random House).

As far as we are concerned,
Thompson and his cohorts can
pass as many arbitrary,
capricious and discriminatory
resolutions as they like, for as
the ‘Academic and Governance
Regulations” state Section Ila,
Article (l)c, paragraph ‘‘3"':
“The sole method...by which
sanctions may be imposed for

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

violations so determined...shall
be a provided in the following
set of procedures to be known as
the ‘The Code of Disciplinary
Procedure.’

“(A) Only that student
conduct duly determined under
the procedure provided in this
document to have been a
violation of: (1) The Code of
Responsibility...and (2) Duly
promulgated college
regulations, is subject to
disciplinary action.”

In effect, any attempt by the
PCC to enforce its resolutions
will be a violation of the
‘‘Academic and Governance
Regulation" which according to
the Vice President for
Academic Affairs is the ‘‘one
source of all the Davidson
College academic and
governance regulations. "’

Bill Alexander ‘73
Davidson College

Terry Holland, local
basketball king, is given a car
to use by Ford, a tradition
begun years ago.

There are other cars here, but
nobody's sure who controls
them. Russ Strong has a white
station wagon at his disposal.

And Mrs. Sarah Penland
holds the keys to two campus
activity cars. These are
designed to implement school
programs, and in theorv could
be used for legitimate student
activities.

Getting the keys from Sarah
is another story. It's like
looking for hen’s teeth or trying

toenda war. ;
The old Buick of Grier Martin

was sold to Dr. Bevan for his
personal car. This was an
activity car, which fell into
disrepair.

In addition, there are trucks
and cars at the gymnasium
designated for use by officials,
coaches, staff. and basketball
players.

Why all the pressure to buy a
car immediately, when the
school owns a fleet of cars
which might serve the same
purpose? .

And in the atmosphere of
what has come to. be
administrative power politics,
who is the real villain of our
story?

Dr. Bevan has offered this car
as a solution, but it could be the
source of many new problems,
instead.

If the great priority for a
student car is actually student
welfare, then it is justified. A
car could be used to transport
students and guests to local
airports.

e issue of cars has been re-
opened, this time by blacks who
want more social organization.
It is possible though, that the

scheduling of groups and
individuals would prove to be an
overwhelming chore.

It could be quite arbitrary.
And it could be more trouble
than it’s worth. Much more
important, however, is the way
a student car figures into the
proposals of the Black Student
Coalition.

In 1970, Davidson offered this
burgeoning group a car solely
for their use. It was refused.
Obviously administrators were
pandering- and the Coalition
wanted no part in a payoff.

It now appears that history
will repeat itself. A car for
social use was the last proposal
on the BSC list.

The programs before it were
crucial for Blacks. They
involved significant change in
curriculum and response in
policy direction.

They required enthusiasm
and understanding in the
Academic Vice-president. Dr.
Bevan began by implementing
the last and least significant
one.

Black students here have
never asked for a handout. By
the same token, they have been
refused what they deserve.
They are correct to demand
more than a car.

in typicai  high-handed
fashion, though, Davidson
administrators hope to buy off
the blacks by giving them a car,
an old house, and a pat on the
head. =

Controversy over this has
obscured the more important
programs of education and
culture proposed by the BSC.

Those who would instead give
students a car, and particularly
to black students, are guilty of
the basest form of patronization
and personal manipulation.

Black Students Attempt To Clarify Aims

To the Editor:

The Black Student Coalition
received on Nov. 15 the
Administration's response to
the proposals presented to it on
October 15. The Faculty
Executive Committee agreed at
that time to present to the BSC a

list of concrete and concise
statements in response to
definite areas of action and
commitment being undertaken
by the Administration. The
members of the BSC
deliberated thoroughly on the
contents of the committee's
statement and has found it, for

the most part, vague and non-

conditions here at Davidson. We
noticed several good ideas and
have encouraged the
Administration to be more
specific as to how these
programs will be put into action
through cooperation of the
Coalition and the Admin-
istration as well as_ the
entire Davidson College student
body.

We recommend that the
students read the list of
proposals in order to more fully
understand the situation. Many
students have misinterpreted
what they have heard due to
their incomplete knowledge of
the contents of the proposals
submitted to the administration.

The BSC will hold an open
end tonight to further clarify
misconceptions and inform the
student body of the situation at
present. Further information
will be posted in the
announcement sheets.

We are certain that most of
the students of Davidson
College realize that putting
these few proposals into effect
will benefit not only Black
Students but. all students. We
thank those students who have
expressed their agreement with
our proposals and have pledged
to help us achieve their
realization. We urge the rest of
the student body to join us in our
efforts.
