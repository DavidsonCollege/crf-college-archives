Rambling notes .. . Catawba col-
lected a total of 19 hits and 24 runs
against the ’Cats and their meeting
last week. That sounds like major
league baseball. Due to ineligibil-
ity, one of the best ball-hawks on
the campus is out pf the Davidson
lineup. Russ Hellekson, who can
play almost any position on the dia-
mond, won't be able to play until
next year because he attended an-
other school last year. Davidson's
fine net team has lost only one
mateh so far this year—that being
an upset at the hands of Emory.
They have been on the winning
side for eight times. Bailey Wil-
liams came pretty close to break-
ing the college record for the dis-
cus in the South Carolina meet —
he tossed the oval a distance of
136 feet, 8 1-2 inches.
