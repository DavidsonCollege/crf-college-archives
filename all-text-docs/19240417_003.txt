“Johnny” Smith—“If you ever marry one,
it'll be that kind.”

“Fresh” (on bus)—"May I sit by you?”
“Buffalo” McKinnon—“You're welcome io
try.”

Soph—“I got in a big fight last week and
was badly hurt in the combat.”
Fresh—“What part of the body is that?”

We observe that McAlpine is wearing ad-
hesive on his chin. He better watch these
girls when he kisses ‘em or he will get hurt.
We knew a man once who got his tongue bit
off the same way. To quote from the well-
known poet, “Duke” Walthall:

“T used to date

Sweet Mary Young;

I quit because
She bit my tongue.”

Hoffman wins the collapsible soda-straw
for being dumb. He forgot that Lab. didn't
meet on Wednesday, and when the Prof.
didn’t arrive, after five minutes he rushed
madly back to his room shouting ‘Hooray!
I got a cut.” Almost as bad as Mr. Jackson.
He left his roll book, so when he got to class
he said: “Everybody that is absent will
please say, so, so I can check up on the class.”

Our weekly song hit: “She was a boot-
legger’s daughter, so he knew she had the
stuff.”

Him—‘I can hold my breath for two
minutes.”

Her—“Gosh!
strong.”

You must be awfully

Tommy—"“How much French have you
had?”

McIntyre—“Four years.”

Tommy—‘“How's that?”
-McIntyre—“One year Fresh—three years
Soph.”

“Have you an opening for a bright young
man ?”

“Yes, and don’t forget to close it when
you go out.”

Fresh Varnadoe says that they had an old
hen on their farm and they fed her on saw-
dust. When she hatched a dozen eggs eleven
of the chicks had wooden legs and one was
a woodpecker.

He says that it gets so hot down in
Thomasville that one summer they tied their
old mule to a crib of pop-corn, and the pop-
corn began popping and flying around the
mule’s ears, and he thought it was snow and
laid down and froze to death.

Well, that’s possible—Varnadoe lives so
far back in the country that he has to go
the last mile on a grape vine.

Women are like street cars—never run
after them for there will be another along
in a minute.
12 o'clock but they are lots faster.

Shiek—“Did you ever go to the zoo?”

Very slow and old-fashioned girl—No. |

Why?”
Shiek—“You ought to go, you'd enjoy see-
ing the snails go whizzing by.”

No, no, Ichabod, Joan of Are was not
Noah's wife and Scotland Yard is not a
playground,

A Londoner looking over a country estate
was startled by a peculiar screeching sound.
“I say, old chap,” he asked, “what is that?”

“An owl.”

“Thunder, I

Bill Murray—“Gimme a cigarette.”

Buster Gray—“I thought you said you had
quit smoking.”

Bill—‘Well, I've reached the first stage—
I've quit buying.”

Freshman (looking over a musical pro- |

gram)—"I wonder who composed the in-
termission ?”

Tramp—‘Will you give a poor man a quar-
ter for a bed?”
Lady—“Let's see the bed.”

Prof.—“What three words are used most
often on this class?”

Dave Phlegar—“T don't know.”

Prof.—"Correct.”

In connection with the Chaff column‘;

The Peanut Parcher wishes to announce
the opening of its annual Beauty Contest.
Each student will be allowed one vote. At
present there are five men in this race to de-
termine Davidson's ugliest man, and ahot
race is expected. These contestants are:
Dick McMillan, Vic Brown, “Snaggletooth”
McCrary, Nappy Davis and Irving Johnson.
We feel that these men are all worthy of the
distinction of being Davidson's ugliest men,
and all are well-known on the campus. Mc-
Millan holds the school record for broken
mirrors; Brown has long been recognized for

having the nerve to appear in knickers with |

those legs of his; McCrary has been jilted
oftener than any man in school; Davis is one
of the best tiddledy-winks players on the
campus; while Irving Johnson is the man
who never made a good milkshake in his life.
Besides this, Irving is being backed by Skit
McConnell, the laziest man this side of Den-
ver,

All votes are to be turned in to the Peanut
Parcher and the winner will be awarded a
hand embroidered pick-axe at the close of
the contest. Pick your man and back him
to the limit; everyone is eligible—even pro-
fessors—and considerable rivalry is expected.

DAVIDSON ADMITTED TO
FEDERATION OF COLLEGES

(Continued from page 1)
explain Student Government and the Honor
System. Friday evening a trip was made
to Trinity and N. C. State by bus, and Fri-

| day night a dance was given for the delegates

in the college “gym.”
The convention was occupied Saturday
morning with a discussion on athletics, spe-

‘cial attention being given to baseball, stu-

dent managers, athletic council, coaching
problems, and commercial athletics. The
members went on record in favor of allowing
college baseball players to play unorganized
ball in the summer. This decision will be
brought before the S. I. C., in an attempfito
bring about a similar action on their part.
Saturday evening the following officers
were elected for the coming year: President,
Tom Ballentine, University of Kentucky;
vice-president, Hoey, N. C. State; secretary-
treasurer, Morton, V. P. I. The University
of Florida at Gainesville was selected for the
1924 convention. ee

The Davidson delegates are decidedly en-

thusiastic over the results of this conference!

and hope to try out in the near future a num-
ber of the ideas brought forward, ‘which
they believe will be of immense profit to this
school.

COMMITTEES DISCUSSED

AT C. E. T.C. MEETING

A very interesting and instructive meeting
of the C. E. Training Class was held on last
Sunday afternoon. L. L, Deck led the song
service and W. E. Milton was in charge of
the program,

The members voted to unite with the Vol-
unteer Band in a joint sunrise prayer meet-
ing on Easter morning.

Four major committees of Christian En-
deavor were fully discussed: the Léokout,
Social, Missionary, and Prayer Meeting
Committees. The group was divided into
four teams, each team discussing a commit-
tee. The leaders of the four groups were:
Hollingsworth, Purdy, Lynch, and Bowie.
Aftera thorough study of these main com-
mittees, very interesting talks on the duties
and importance of minor committees were
made.

Freshmen Coach Signs

| To Manage Abbeville

Coach Rawson Accepts Player-
Manager Position With South
Carolina Team

Coach C. W. Rawson, mentor of the Wild-
| kitten teams of 1923-24, has signed up as
;manager of the Abbeville club in the Caro- |
|lina league this season. Coach will report |
for duty on May 15th, not leaving Davidson |
| until after the Freshman nine mets M. P.
|C. I. here on the 6th.

| As player-manager Coach Rawson will
serve in a double capacity. He will in all
probability direct his outfit from behind the
plate, for in that position he has played stel-
lar ball for the University of Georgia and|
| various professional organizations. He was |
with the Columbia team of the South Atlan-
tic league when it won the pennant in 1919
|and defeated Atlanta in a post-season series.

’ The work that Coach Rawson has done |
with the Freshman football and basketball |
teams shows his unquestionable ability as a
leader and coach. And his success with the
eleven and with the quintet is alone equalled
by his good influence and popularity with the
boys.

COLGATE TENNIS SHARKS

(Continued from page 1)

gate man carried the hard-fought
| match 6-3, 4-6, 6-2.

In the No. 2 singles Jim: Trotter went
down before B. J. Rockafellow, 6-2, 6-3.
“Jim” waited for the fight to be brought to
him and though he put up a valiant fight, his
strokes failed to bear the sting that would
have forced the Easterner to a loss. Staley
on the contrary pounded the flannel sphere
for all he was worth but managed to get
}only the second set out of his match with
A. L. Devine, the Colgate captain; score,
6-2, 4-6, 6-3.

Mae Beall found W. H. Story easy meat,

away

running the younger lad into a 6-1, 6-2 loss.
“Mac,” through his placements and slow
drop, registered the only™yd and Black win
in the solo matches,

Young and Rockelellow kept Price
Staley on the defense of the first doubles
encounter. The Wildcat duo fought every
step of the way, both making wonderful re-
coveries, but the Colgate men played well
together and won the match 6-1, 7-5.

Mac Beall, teamed with Jim Trotter, out-
steadied and outplayer Devine and H. P.
| Bromfield after losing the first set, 3-6, 10-8,
16-2, The visitors sent most of their shots
at Jim Trotter and Jim made some returns
that showed he had not lost his old power.

This was the second meeting of Colgate’s
Southern tour. The Red and White racket-
cers defeated Wake Forest 4-1, and after
leaving Davidson take on Washington and
| Lee, University of Virginia, William and
| Mary, George Washington U., Navy, and
| Penn Military. They hope to come back
|again to Davidson next spring.

Irvin Johnson—“We've been selling
these pills for 30 years and we've never
had a complaint: What does that prove?”

Selser—“Dead men tell no tales.”
