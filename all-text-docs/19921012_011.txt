own bed and his own color.

Back to Harlem. Gator isn’t
just asking for money anymore.
Now he’s asking for the color TV,
so he can “watch the Mets game”.
Yeah; right. But sweet mom gives
it to him anyway. So he comes
back again. This time he gets vio-
lent, throwing things and scream-
ing; “give me money!” Reverend
(dad) comes home, hears Gator,
and in one of the most powerful
scenes in the movie, shoots gator
in the abdomen, places the pistol
on an open bible, and sits down in

his easy chair. Harsh.

. Gator is dead, Angela is back
in Bensonhurst, and Flipper is back
with his wife. It appears as though
the rest of the company gets sent to

the cleaners while Flipper.comes .

out smelling like a rose.. Not so.

Projecting to the future, we see -

Flipper walking out of his apart-
ment. He is accosted by a prosti-
tute. At first taken aback, Flipper
then grasps the girl’s head to his
chest in a fatherly embrace and
screams “No!” as he realizes that
he is holding his daughter. That’s
how it ends.

It’s hard’ to say what Spike
Lee is trying to tell us here. Paulie
is starting where Flipper left off.

Gatorisdead, and Flipper’s daugh-
ter is following in his footsteps.
What does it all mean? Mary and
I have come to the conclusion that

‘we're really notsure. We can’t say

that this film is against mixed rela-
tionships, because we never found
out how Paulie ended up.

It’s not a film against Italians
or Blacks, because both were por-
trayed in positive and negative

_ lights. Maybe Lee is telling us that

life really is just an inescapeable
circle of suffering. Actually, Mary
and I did come to one conclusion:
Dan Quayle would probably not
like Jungle Fever. C-Ya. '

harm is done.

Bleek is not the only ostenta-
tiously selfish character, however.
“Giant,” played by Spike Lee, is
Bleek’s manager, anda poor one at
that. Unfortunately, he is a worse
gambler thanamanager. Inascene
in which three gambling-ring thugs
decide to pay for Giant’s debts in
flesh, there is a moment in which
they question how exactly they
will do this since Giant is a
“brother.” One thug answers,

- “Break him like he’s an Afro-

American,” and they thereby break

all his fingers. Spike Lee, as writer

and director, demonstrates the im-

- possibility of race consciousness

to take precedent over self-inter-
est.

Ina violentand moving scene,

Spike Lee reaffirms the value of ©

friendship and loyalty. Giant has
his face beaten in by two thugs
again for not paying up on his
gambling debts. It seems as if
Bleek knows this is coming, but
since he was consumed in an abso-
lutely smoking solo, he doesn’t

react in time to save his friend.

After the tune ends heruns out
of the jazz bar, and there sees his
friend badly hurt. He tells the
thugs he had the money for them,
but they say it’s too late. Bleek
makesacourageous stand, but they
were too much for him. His career
is ended in that devastating mo-
ment.

Mo’ Better Bluesisessentially
an Afro-american film, and out-
side of the theme mentioned above,
which is universal in nature, ele-
ments cannot be separated from
this culture. There are many refer-
ences to the Harlem Renaissance
of the 20’s and 30’s, and Lee may
actually be calling for this kind of
response from Black America.

Time and again we see post-
ers, albums, music of the late great
John Coltrane, one of the greatest
saxophonists of all time, and a
prophet of jazz. Lee uses a quote
of Coltrane’s to end the movie
which refers to music as the Love
Supreme. We hear the music of
Miles Davis, and Bleekevennames
his son “Miles.” All these ele-
ments reinforce the great heritage
of Afro-american history in the
world of jazz music.

Lee criticizes his own culture
for its lack of support in these
endeavors. Bleek, in a drunken
argument\ with his saxophone
player friend Shadow, complains
that you never see any Blacks in
the audience, any of their own
people, always people of other
races. Shadow argues that you
must create a music which has an
appeal to the Black audience.

Lee makes an attempt to show
that the’ever-present dialectic be-
tween the audience and the per-
former has a resolve: jazz music, a
great contribution of Afro-
american culture, not only asserts
the legitimacy and power of that
culture, but has a universal appeal
as well. Good music, as this is,
goes beyond the self-aggrandize-
ment of the player. On first listen-
ing to jazz, there is little question
as to its cultural source, but its
intellectual aspects and the beauty
of its unique sound takes a step
beyond the issue of race. These
qualities are what make the music
The Love Supreme.

activity.

The men don’t understand herava-
ricious ‘sexual appetite, and con-
sole themselves in Freudian inter-

pretations and sex addiction prog- -

noses of Nora.

Nora self-consciously takes
these cues to heart and trots to the
local sex therapist, who assures
Nora of the normalcy of her sexual
desires and needs. After a Thanks-
giving dinner, a burning Malleus-
like nightmare, and a rape scene
(because Nora doesn’t want tohave

love made to her; she wants “to be
fucked” (Jamie Overstreet)), Nora
confronts the possibility of losing
the man she truly loves (ironically
Jamie), and decides to do the mo-
nogamy thing once and for all.
She vows celibacy for at least
a while, which elicits Jamie’s ob-
servation of the archetypical prob-
lem of female sexuality: Nora goes
from one extreme to another -
there’sno (sexual) in-between! The

slut-saint dualistic nature of fe-—

male sexuality proves itself to be
true once again. But Nora doesn’t
care; ultimately, she leaves Jamie,
because he wanted a wife and she
wanted control. Besides, she’s just
not a one-man woman.

laundry.

T-I think the message Spike Lee
was trying to send is that people
need to “wake up” and take a look
around. Aside from racism, there
are a great deal of intraracial prob-
lems that need to be taken care of.

R-Word, we as a people need to
“wake up” and deal with the prob-
_ lems concerning ourselves. Right
now we are walking in a daze. I

don’t just mean African-Ameri-
cans, butall Americans, especially
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW!

T-And for all you ratings buffs, I

give this movie four stars. Did you

actually think I would dis Spike?

(Dis= the dismissal or disrespect

of another human being.

lang Dictionary, 1992

R-No, I didn’t, because I gave it
four stars also. Yo Rock, now
what were you saying about the
SEX,

Lee’s entry for the Encyclo-
pedia of Male Understanding of
Female Sexuality can be looked at
as comparatively sexually liberat-
ing. Nora guiltlessly likes and par-
ticipates in sexual activity, and has
mastered self-satisfaction. The film
interestingly tropes various works
of theater and literature, strikes the
viewer with clever caricatures and
photo-montage interludes, and ig-
nites arousal of all sorts through
the interaction of. its African-
american-only players. But the
frosting-sweet taste of the film’s
entertainment value pulls out a

_moment too soon to cover the ran-

cid aftertaste of its biting inner
layers.

Whistlin' Dixie

Matt Bumstead

On September 15, a great
chase began in country music; al-
most instantaneously, another
great chase came to an abrupt halt.

Confused?

Let me putit this way, Garth
Brooks’ fifth album on Liberty
records, entitled The Chase, .has
just hit stores. Billy Ray’s cam-
paign for the spot at the top of
country just got snuffed.

Today’s country music em-
pire could be nicknamed “the
house that Garth built”. And, sadly
for the man who has made our ears
Achy and Breaky - Billy Ray
Cyrus, for those of you who have
been comatose - he has come to

" puthis house in order. Sorry, Billy
Ray, there’s only room for one at

his boots.

Garth Brooks has stayed so
firmly at the top of country music
that he has been put in a class by
himself, and he is now consider-
ing doing something that would
only be a fitting end to his mete-
oric career.

Retire? Are you kidding?
With over twenty million copies
of his first three albums sold, the
number one selling recording art-
ist of any format in 1991 is think-
ing of hanging it up? °

Well, he’s got enough dough
to last a while; and he’s got Taylor
Mayne Pearl Brooks, his infant
daughter who has stolen his heart,
and maybe his passion. Besides,
he could be the first artist (maybe
ever) to retire when he or she is at
the top - before that inevitable
downhill slide begins to take over
hiscareer.

All this aside, I’ll believe it
when I see it.

He has now been the top coun-
try act for two solid years (and the
top overall for one). Everyone is
still wondering, “When will he be
overtaken?” Alan couldn’t do it,
andneithercould Clint. Billy Ray?
Sorry, but there’s just not enough
there.

The Chase can be Garth
Brooks’ project. He knows it will
have to end, but he also knows he
is still the biggest entertainer in all
of music. And, whereas he is
considering retiring, he’s gotta

.know that he can do whatever he
wants with this one. It.can be his
tory lap after a world record,

the top; and you were stepping on .

Garth Brooks Ends
The Chase for #1

unthinkable race.

Garth Brooks - The Chase
Liberty Records

When I heard the first single
offthis album, “We Shall Be Free”
(which is co-written, along with
four other songs on this release,
by Brooks), [knew that the course
of The Chase would carry Brooks,
and consequently, country mu-
sic, through uncharted territory.
The song is backed by a gospel
choir and a steady gospelesque
arrangement, complete with
pounding piano and a beat that
makes your hands clap them-
selves. The song is not country -

“but Garth finds a’ way, through

his country vocals and a few
twangy guitars, to make it coun-
try. What it is - and it is not alone
on this album - is Brooks’ effort
at social commentary. “When
the last thing we notice is the | .
color of skin/When the first thing
we look for is the beauty within .
.. then we shall be free.”

Another social message

comes in “Face to Face”, the

middle verse of which is about
date rape - “And with a finger
your can put his fists away/when
you’re face to face.” The song is
written by the same man who
wrote Brooks’ first megahit “The
Dance” (sortofachangeof pace).
It works well, but don’t be misled
by the billing by USA Today as
“this album’s ‘The Thunder
Rolls’”. My only complaint (and

-in a week or so, I’ll no longer

nofice it) is that the instrumenta-
tion on this song, for which drive
and force are as essential to the
effectas they were in “The Thun-
der Rolls”, is a little too quiet to
knock the listener over the way it
could and should. Play this one
on surround or ambience and you
can take care of it.

Brooks chooses to perform
three previously recorded tunes -
the soft and warm “Night Rider’s
Lament”, the jazzed-up, grinding
version of Patsy Cline’s““Walkin’
After Midnight”, and a swagger-
ing, loose-belted rendition of
Little Feat’s “Dixie Chicken”. All
three are strong, but “Walkin’” is
the weakest, and perhaps should
have been substituted for a fresh
