DR. WHALING DELIVERS LEC-
TURE.

which did so much to instill in the man
the ideals of his noble ancestry. Then
upon graduation from Princeton he went
to the University of Virgina and to
Johns Hopkins for further pursuance of
the work to which he seemed most in-
terested and best adapted.

Then in the third place, Dr. Whaling
spoke of the reaction of his training and
environment, Even as a. student of 17
here at Davidson, Woodrow Wilson had
his singular ideals and his character was
singularly formed. He believed and was
always anxious to stand up for his be-
lief, that a man could be as true a Chris-
tian and do as noble a work for God on
earth in public and civil life as well as
in the Church alone. He was recognized
on the campus, says Dr. Whaling, as the
political leader, At the end of his days
of training Wilson hung out his shingle
in Atlanta, where he practiced law for
almost one year, with a firm name of
Wilson-Renick. Dissatisfied with this
realizing that he was not intended for
the legal profession, he became a profes-
sor in a female college, which the speaker
referred to as a glorious work, but not
in Woodrow Wilson's line. He found
himself, however, as professor of political
science in Princeton Universitv. Here
it was not a question of how many men
would be in the class, but rather how
would the lecture room accommodate
those anxious to attend. From here, Dr.
Whaling tells us, Wilson was: “kicked”
to the Governorship of New Jersey, to
the Presidency of the United States, and
now he stands as supreme dictator of in-
ternational politics. This is just the re-
action of the training of the youth of 17
here at Davidson College.

Dr. Whaling terms his last force in
action as Divine dynamic. No man ever
moved the world and held the destinies
of nations in his grasp, who did not
realize himself as one supported
and sustained by the Supreme Architect.
So then, does our President realize this
fact, just as the one who said, “I am
what I am by the grace of God.” The
speaker refers to him as one of the great-

make it a better one. Davidson men have
Entire New Line of
their college than any college men. ‘There
is not a true Davidson man who is not
willing and anxious to do something to
help his Alma Mater. ‘The trouble is
he does not know exactly what to do
and suffers from a lack of co-ordination
with the others in his efforts.

Now if a Greater Davidson Club is
formed you will have others to help you
and aid you in your plans. ‘Che word
“Greater” is used to mean more than
greater in size, It means greater in that
you will help make it nearer the ideal
college. It means greater in that it will
have a greater influence and scope of
work; do more effective work then ever:
better spirit will exist on the campus,
with a development of greater loyalty
and respect for the college and a larger
student body.

The Davidsonian stands for a “Great-
er Davidson,” and so does every loyal son
of Davidson. We are proud of her, of
what she has done in the past, of what
she is now and is doing, and it is the
purpose of the “Greater Davidson Club”
to make us even prouder of what she
will be in the future because she will
be greater and her achievements will be
greater.
