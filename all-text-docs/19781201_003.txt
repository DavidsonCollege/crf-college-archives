College and student officials.
go slow on 100-watt proposal

By DONALD CALDWELL
Asst. News Editor

Student Body ‘President’
Bruce Brown expressed quali-
fied support this week for a
100-watt student-operated ra-
dio station.

“The SGA would support
a new station but we first have
to have some expression of
widespread student interest.
This is just a first step. But it
must be there in order to justify
expenditure of funds on a
station.”

Brown continued, ‘‘We aren’t
interested in providing an illu-
sion of interest. It needs to be

the Senate will organize a task
force to look into finances,

vided the interest is genuine.

“There is no need to whip up
interest that's not real. But if it
is genuine then the college
administration has made it clear
that it will accept the propo-
sal.’’

Terry added, “As a Media
Board member, I think we
should have.a very clear role in
mind for the station and where
the lines of authority run. That’

Grover Meetze, Director of

College President Samuel

“I’ve been very much impressed
with the work that Bill Little
has done.”

Although the Commons i is to

Hobart’s Park cuts costs

The editors\of Hobart’s Park, Davidson's new literary magazine,
have decided to have the magazine printed by Moreland Hogan,
the editor of the Mecklenburg Gazette,’ instead of a Charlotte

printer.

Hogan can print the magazine at half the cost of the lowest

previous offer, and the location.of his press, in Davidson, will be
much more convenient for the staff.

This move entails

‘the date of the first issue from

December 8 to early in the last wéek before Christmas break.
According to Amanda Hall, one of the editors, the first issue will

be well worth the wait

“In this issue we'll have one excellent long short story, a lot of

poetry, some political writing and

essays, a photographic essay,

College President Samuel
Spencer considers the 100-watt
station a viable possibility gi-
ven student support. He added,

-however, that. other options

should not be overlooked.
“Besides a 100 watt station,
there is the possibility of an FM
side band as well as of a carrier
current. I feel the latter is the
best way to go. This would not
require FCC licensing."’
Spencer. noted that an FM
side band, which had been
considered briefly, would be too
expensive to implement. The
side band alternative. would
require students wishing to

listen to the station to purchase

special receiving equipment.
Former WDAV Station Man-

‘ager Carrington Thompson, *

who first aired the 100-watt
proposal four weeks ago at a
student rally, disagreed with

Spencer.
' “A carrier current station is
not a viable alternative,”’ he

said.

“I'd very much like to see a
100-watt station although it
would require FCC. licensing:

“Another possibility would
be a cable FM station. Like a
cartier current operation, it
would not need FCC approval
though it has high fidelity,”’
Thompson stated, “but it would
be expensive installing cable
outlets in each room.”

Thompson stressed the need
for clear guidelines on the
station’s governance before any
further progress on the proposal .
takes place. He called a Nov-
ember 22 statement by the
