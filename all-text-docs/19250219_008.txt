| The Editor of the Richmond College
|commenting on the recent suspension of
l three Smith College girls for smoking
| says, “The main objection to college girls
| smoking is that they look so distressed
in the majority of cases. However
graceful she may be by nature, she be-
comes artificial, constrained, and awk-
ward when smoking. They give them-
selves away by not knowing what-to do.
They do not know whether to swallow it
or exhale it through their nostrils. Too
many college girls fail to realize that
they cannot compete with the popular
little stenogs who are capable of finger-
jing cigarettes with as much ease as the
i keys of their typewriters, in any in-
Stance if parents wish their daughters
,to learn the art they should not send
them to Smith. College.” rf

Two thousand of the’Stanford: alumni
who are veterans of the World War, may
pool their bonus policies for the con-
struction of a memorial hall at the uni-
versity.—Yellow Jacket.

{ A Davidson chapter of the Red Cross or-
| ganization was organized in the Civi League
hall at Davidson last week.

Davidson since the war period has been a
branch of the Charlotte chapter of Red Cross,
but recently Davidson and Cornelius united
to organize a new chapter and have already
signed as members 175 persons from Dewese
and Lemly districts of Mecklenburg county.
One hundred and fifty members were needed
before national headquarters would give Da-
vidson a charter. Davidson will receive its
charter in a few days.

This chapter will probably be the smallest
chapter in the entire Red Cross organization.
Under the following officers it is sure to be
of great service to this district: Chairman,

Davidson lost to Clemson, 28-26, in a
hard-fought game.

The Davidsonian was reduced in size
because of the flu epidemic.

A four-game trip into Virginia was
cancelled because of the flu.

A letter signed, “E, Pluribus Unum,”
comes out in the Open Forum with a |
justifiable kick because the Elon game |
was called off as “it would be harmful |
to stand in a well-ventilated gym and |
cheer your own Red and Black team on |
to victory.” Nevertheless chapel was!
held the next morning and an _ hour’s |
lecture given to the battalion. “Why
not a Bulletin Board in place of chapel?” |
