oR. PIERCE HARRIS

Dr. Harris To Present
AshlinWhite Lectures

The Ashlin White Bible Lec-
tures, which have been held yearly
since 1043 in memory of the Rev-
erend Robert Ashlin White, D.D.,
beloved former pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church, Mooresville,
N. C., will be given next week
from October $1 to November 5.

The guest lecturer this year is
Dr. Pierce Harris, Pastor of the
First Methodist Church, Atlanta,

Dr. Harris is an outstand-
ing leader in his field.

Because of the inability of Dr.
Harris to be present for Sunday
services because of his own busy
pastorate in Atlanta, the Trustees
of the Lectureship have secured
for the opening day of the 1954
Lectures the Rev. Robert Ashlin
White, Jr., Assistant Minister of
the First Presbyterian Church,
Winston-Salem, as the lecturer for
the Morning Worship, and the Rev.
Costen J. Harrell, D.D., Resident
Bishop of the Charlotte Area of

Sigma Upsilon Elects
Eight New Members

Eight new members were elect-
ed to the Sigma Upsilon fraternity
at the meeting of the group on
October 21. Those students who
were chosen are Frank White, Joel
Conarroe, Jason McManus, Tom
Dove, Maurice Crouse, and Jim
Kuist. Dr. Lee Copple and Dr.
George Labban, of the Davidson
faculty, were also elected for mem-
bership. .

Sigma Upsilon is a national lit-
erary fraternity which stresses
creative writing and a raising of
the intellectual level on the cam-
pus. It is made up of members of
the faculty and student body who
have a serious bent toward creat-
ive writing.

Davidson's Blue Pencil chapter
was founded in 1015. At chapter
meetings members read literary
works before the group and offer
constructive criticism of the work
of other members.

Negro Community Hut
is Almost Completed

Oy FRANKLIN BLOODWORTH

The final results of the 1953-
84 College Gift Fund are rapidly
mounting as work on the Negro
Community Center, the job chosen
by the student body last year’ as
its Gift Fund Project, is brought
to completion.

The Community Center serves as
a center of Negro activities for all
ages as well as the center of all
Y.M:C.A-sponsored activities for
the Negro Community.

Under the direction of Hunter
Strader, some $3,750 was donated
by the students and faculty last
Christmas for the moving and ren-
ovation of the Community Center.

Vast improvements have been
made on the building since that
time. First of all, $800 of the
money was used to buy a new lot,
60 by 180 feet, which was needed
because of the necessity of mov-
ing the building from its former
location. It took $40 to have the
land cleared and another $800 to
move the building to its new lo-
eation.

The major portion of the Gift
Fund, around $2,000, was spent
for the complete renovation of the
Center. This included a new coat
of paint, improvements in the

framework of the building, and

the adding of two new bathrooms

and a new storage room.

New electric light fixtures and
electric outlets were installed, and
the whole building was rewired.
A second-hand electric stove re-
placed the old wood-burning stove,
and a new gas furnace, costing
$100, was installed.

Still left to be bought with the
remainder of the Gift Fund are
an electric refrigerator and a set
of folding chairs and tables. Later,
a juke box is to be installed.

Plans for ¥Y. M. C. A.sponsored
activities at the Center this year
include a teen-age club and a pro-
gram of adult education. The Com-
munity Post of the Y. M. C. A,,
which is in charge of these activi-
ties, is headed by Dolph Allen.

All students and faculty are in-
vited to see the Center, which is
completed except for some more
work to be done on the floors. The
building is located on Graham
street, in the Northwest section of
town.

Already this year several stu-
dents have given their time to
help work on the project. Any
others who are interested in com-
munity work and would like to
participate are requested to get in
touch with Dolph Allen or Mr.
Magill.

Editor Loy, full of new ideas
gained at the meeting of the As-
sociated Collegiate Press Confer-
ence this past week, said that this
year Quips and Cranks is “seeking
to present a true picture of the
year 1954-1955 at Davidson, neg-
lecting neither the aims of the
administration nor the students’
responses to these aims.” The an-
nual intends to present “just as
true a picture ten years from now
as in the year 1954-1955”.
Concurrent with these purposes
is the adoption of a new contem-
porary format design which will
make the 1954-1955 Quips and
Cranks outstanding in appearance
as well as in content.

Bristol's Dr. T. A. Fry
To Speak At Vespers

The Vesper speaker for this Sun-
day will be Dr. Thomas Albert
Fry, Jr., pastor of the First Pres-
byterian Church in Bristol, Ten-
nessee.

Dr. Fry attended the Georgia
School of Technology from 1936 to
1938, and graduated from David-
son College with an A.B. degree
after transferring here in his jun-
ior year. He then went to Union
Theological Seminary in Rich-
mond, Virginia, where he earned
his B.D. degree in 1943.

In 1949 he received a degree of
Master of Theology from Union
Seminary, and the degree of Doc-
tor of Divinity was presented to
him by King College in 1952.

Dr. Fry has held several pas-
torates in Virginia, North Caro-
lina and Tennessee. He came to
his present one in Bristol in 1950.

D.C. Hits Air Waves

Miller And Whitman
Speak On Eastern
Problems, Progress

BY JOHN HARMON

Dr. Alvah L. Miller brought his
experience and knowledge of the
Near East to an interested group
of about 70 Davidson students and
faculty members in the ball room
of the College Union on Wednes-
day evening. Dr. Miller, who for
19 years was General Secretary of
the YMCA in India and for 15
years head of the YMCA in Jerv-
salem, delivered a forceful and in-
telligent lecture concerning the
oroblems facing the Near East to-
day and the importance of our con-
sideration of them.

He is one of the few Americans
who have first-hand information
on the Arab-Israeli dispute, per-
haps the most serious of all the
oroblems. Dr. Miller had the
unique advantage of having con-
tacts with both parties involved in
the events and decisions which
eventually broke into armed war-
fare in Israel. He also had the
privilege of being a_ personal
friend of T. E. Lawrence of Ara-
bia and of Count Bernadotte, who
was the United Nations mediator
of the Arab-Israeli conflict until
his assassination by Zionist extre-
mists.

In his lecture, Dr. Miller empha-
sized the strategic importance of
the Near East to the United States,
There are many new states emer-
ging in this part of the world as a
result of World War II, and these
states are looking to America —
Some with fear, some with hope,
some with suspicion, some with re-
spect—and are watching closely to
determine whether the world lead-
ership of the United States will be
a success or failure.

The types of government adopt-
ed by these new states will depend
largely upon the result of observa-
tton by intelligent and influential
leaders in Near Eastern affairs.
It is significant that 48 per cent
of the world’s oil supply is located
in such countries as Arabia, Egypt,
Iraq, and Iran.

Several of the tremendous prob-
lems with which the Near East is
confronted are leadership, educa-
tion, health, and the interminable
ArabJewish dispute.

During the open discussion per-
iod after the lecture, Mr. Arthur
Whitman, the new head of the

ROTC To Present Static
Display Of Equipment

A static display by the David-
son College ROTC department will
occupy a prominent position dur-
ing Homecoming festivities. This
display, to be featured in front of
the College Union, is to allow par-
ents and alumni to see the equip-
ment and facilities of the military
department. In addition to the
ROTC cadre, cadet officers will be
present to asgist in the conducting
of the display.

instruction And Competition

Rifle instruction and dismount-
ed drill have occupied the last two
drill periods. Instruction on the as-
sembly, disassembly, and nomen-
clature of the rifle by cadet of-
ficers and non-coms brought this
phase of the military into drill
period for the first time. This de-
velopment is in line with the ov-
erall policy of allowing cadet of-
ficers to operate the corps.

F Company, commanded by Ca-

det Captain Lambe, and C Com-
pany, commanded by Cadet Cap-
tain Canon, are currently .in the
lead in company standings. One
interesting aspect of this’ compe-
tition among the companies is that
the top company at the end of the
next two drill periods will re-
ceive free cuts for the following
drill.

Brice Receives Commendation

Jim Brice, a sophomore member
of the corps, has been commend-
ed for his excellent work in the
PIO (Public Information) work of
the unit, particularly for his “Ser-
geant Sketches” in the Davidson-
ian.

“spit and polish" to get ready for
an inspection by Colonel Settle,
Commander of the North Carolina
Military District on November 23.

Le Cercle Francais held its first
regular meeting of the year on
Tuesday night, October 26, at the
home of Professor and Mrs.

formal dance will be held from

mediately following Saturday’s
game will be held in the middle

mitting.

Eollowing one of the fastest ris-
es ever witnessed in the musical
world, the May group continues
to feature their familiar fresh and
clean approach. After their recent
waxing session with Capitol Rec-
ords, a prominent music critic de-
scribed their style as “a tidal wave
of fresh musical expression.”

Soon after the organization of
the band only 22 months ago, it
became evident that they were
much wanted for various engage-
ments throughout the country.

When Billy May found that he
would be unable to travel with
his group, he was wise to choose
such a capable assistant as Sam
Donahue. Born in Detroit, Sam
early excelled in athletics, playing
varsity football, baseball, and bas-
ketball while attending Redford
High in the Motor City. Although
at first music was merely a hobby,
it was soon to crowd sports from
his mind and become his major
interest.

After his band, organized while
he was still in high school, had
held the spotlight for some time
at the Coral Gables Ballroom in
East Lansing, Michigan, they be-
came quite well known throughout
that region. Yet Sam realized that
this local popularity meant very
little when viewed on a national
scale. He then decided to accept
one of the big band offers and in
1938 joined the Gene Krupa outfit.

In 1940 Donahue and his tenor
saxophone joined with Harry
James and later that same year
played with Bennie Goodman. Fea-
tured coast-to-coast with these
three top bands, he had become
the outstanding tenor-man among
saxophone players in the entire
nation.

Soon after the outbreak of
World War II, Sam was drafted
into the Navy and there formed
a band which was soon well known
among service men in all the for:
eign theaters. Probably best known
for his entertainment in the form
of competitive shows with Glenn
Miller and Count Basie, he was
widely acclaimed as the United
Kingdom's number one foreign
band favorite.

After lending his talents as chief
arranger for all navy bands during

{|the Korean War, he returned to

civilian life to become assistant
leader of the Tommy Dorsey band.
From this musical group he went
to his present job of handling the
Billy May band on its current
tour.

April Ames has also risen sur-
prisingly fast in the musical realm
and has been quite successful in
her vocal career thus far.

Reading Classes To Start Monday

By CLAGETT TAYLOR

The Davidson College Remedial
Reading Clinic will begin its fall
series of classes Monday, Novem-
ber 1, in room 231, Chambers
Building.

This clinic is an outgrowth of an
experiment in remedial reading in-
struction conducted last spring by
Dr. Jay H. Ostwalt of the Student
Counseling Office. Mrs. Henry Lil-
ly will be the instructor of the
classes this year.

The program has a two-fold pur-
pose: to speed up slow readers
and also to make substantial in-
creases in the reading rates of
those who already have high
speeds. Type I, a course for de-
ficient readers, includes special
training in all basic reading skills
such ss vocabulary, thought analy-
sis, and speed. Type II, which is
Office in room 231, Chambers

Building.

for advanced readers, gives a ser-
ies of speed training exercises such
as lengthening eye span and timed
exercises. -

Students attend three classes a
week either on Monday, Wednes-
day, and Friday or on Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday during
either third or four periods. The
fall program of the clinic will run
from November 1 through Decem-
ber 16 and then continue on from
January 4 through January 15.

A second series will be run
sometime during the second semes-
ter.

The course charges are $25.00
for Type I and $10.00 for Type I.
All necessary: technical equipment
is furnished by the college.

Last spring the clinic purchas-
ed new equipment valued at al-
most $1,000 to use in the project.

Probably the most expensive and
most used piece of equipment is
the tachistoscope, a slide projec:
tor which flashes digits and phras-
es on a screen at exposures up to
one one-hundredth of a second.

Before beginning the reading
program, each student is given an
eye test to determine any visual
defeats which might hinder his
reading. Reading tests to determine
each person’s rate of reading and
his comprehension of what he has
read are given at the beginning
and end of the program.

Dr. Ostwalt believes that this
addition to the student counseling
services will put Davidson's coun-
seling program on an equal with
the best found in the south. Any-
one with questions concerning the
Remedial Reading Clinic should
inquire at the Student Counseling
