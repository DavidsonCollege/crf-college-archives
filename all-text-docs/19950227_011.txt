THE DAVIDSONIAN

The Davidson College Department of
Theater and Speech’s production of The
Heidi Chronicles by Wendy Wasserstein
ended its six performance run yesterday,
and Ann Marie Costa can relax. Chronicles
was her directorial debut at Davidson, and
as a new professor, she surely felt the pres-
sure of expected excellence. Well, Profes-
sor Costa, it was good.

The Heidi Chronicles tells the story of
a woman named Heidi Holland and her 25-
year search for happiness and how that defi-

nition of happiness changes as she and the -

times change.

More than anything else, the music had
ahand in shaping the experience. Before the
show began, Carole King was belting out “I
Feel the Earth Move,” which cunningly re-
flected themes inthe play. Aretha Franklin’s
“Respect” played behind a 1970s women’s
support group meeting. The characters paid
respects to John Lennon in a 1980s scene
with “Imagine” on the hi-fi. And Heidi sung
Sam Cooke’s “You Send Me” to her infant
daughter in 1989, just as her lover Scoophad
sung it to her at his wedding in 1977. While

the performances were great, it is the music
that lingers in my mind.

' Kathryn Schlee’s costume design was
subtle—never did the actors’ clothes scream
out the era; rather, the costumes allowed the
script and the actors to establish the time.
The set, as well, was not reflective of any
certain decade. It’s orange-peach tones and
angular construction gave the cast a neutral
area that they could manipulate as needed.
Set designer Joe Gardner did surprise us
with a revolving stage, though. (Perhaps he
also could have designed a way to conceal
the stage hands manually rotating it.) Ronnie
Higdon’s lighting was simple yet effective,
and again allowed the cast and the script to
craft something of their own.

What they crafted was a show Davidson
is not used to: a quiet exploration of human-
ity. No French bourgeois, no cracked-up
bishops, no buried children, no nudity. Just
people like you and me who feel like their
“world gets narrower and narrower,” as one
character says. The cast did a fine job of
filling this narrow space, and never let the
normalcy of the script deprive it of energy.
As Heidi, junior Amanda Davis was charm-
ingly stand-offish, always remaining some-
what bitchy without losing her heart, and

always allowing the other characters to up-
stage her when they should have. A lesser
actress would have stolen the show and its

meaning altogether.

albums such as Lincoln, Flood,
and Apollo 18, whole clusters of
people jumped in rhythm, knock-
ing their neighbors about in oblivi-
ous abandonment.

In between songs John F.
talked about life, the universe, and
whatever else came to mind. When
the group promised a new song,
they had a short discussion about
music theory (“Is the fourth major
or minor?”) before launching into
“Particle Man” “with the collec-
tive sorrow of every band onearth”
since they’d decided to play it in

the minor key. John L. didn’thave .

any qualms about correcting his
band-mate during the song by
pointing out, “fifth is major” which
was received with a sheepish, “oh.”

One of John F.’s suggestions
was to starta conga line to go along
with the horn-driven “No One

obre

Knows My Plan” which, he said,
was “‘a lot more fun when it works.
Also, those of you in the back
might be in the front by the end of
the song.” The crowd was willing
to comply although the line didn’t
improve its position much.

As Ethan McCutchen (one of
the. people I went with) pointed
out, it was refreshing to watch a
band that didn’t take themselves
very seriously. How could they?
Their style of music is fun and
entertaining. I can’t think of a
song that isn’t performed with this
in mind. I love this band, andI was
not disappointed in the least when
Isaw themlive. Even people who’d
never heard They Might Be Giants
before enjoyed the show and I’m
not surprised. It is an indication of
greatness.

School Daze, a parody on the
experiences of black students at
Davidson, proved to be an insight-
ful and provocative presentation
for those who attended the: Thurs-
day night show in the 900 Room.
The short skits, performed mostly
by members of the BSC, gave its
audience a glimpse into what was

like to be a minority on a small

college campus.

What was particularly signifi-
cant in the School Daze: presenta-
tion was the discussion which fol-
lowed the performance. For one of
the first times in my experience at
Davidson, I witnessed an open fo-
rum in which racial relations could
be discussed, with amazing can-
dor, by both white and black stu-
dents.

The conversation began de-
bating the term of “Afro-Ameri-
can” as a means to refer to black
students.
term was inappropriate and mis-
leading, and I felt Joy Sparks took
the edge off when she pointed out
that “in trying not to be offensive,”
many people were, in fact, “of-
fending.” Tasha Jenkins supported
this statement when she advised
people to “curb their sensitivity,”
which Adrienne Nixon responded
that “the differences [between
black students and white students]
are there, and they should be cel-
ebrated.”

The question was posed to the
panel as to why they had chosen to
come to Davidson, knowing that

Many of them felt the

they would form such a small per-
centage of the college community.
Jenkins pointed out that Davidson
provided a fantastic academic op-
portunity, which should not have
been overlooked in favor of at-
tending an institution where there
would be more of a racial balance.
She also argued that it’s difficult
when applying to a school to rec-
ognize what a 4% minority actu-
ally translates into when applied to
the number of black students. The
course catalogue, she demon-
strated, was misleading, making it
seem as if there was more of di-
verse mix of students at Davidson
than are actually present.

Jason Burt argued that it was a
challenge for a black person to
come to Davidson, but it was a
challenge that was to be appreci-
ated. He added that if “a black
person can make it through
Davidson,” he could make it
through anything. Nixon declared
that in coming here, she hadn’t
made social life her priority. “It’s
the education,” she declared, “ it’s
the experience you can share being
surrounded by other intelligent
people. It’s not who you party
with on the weekends.”

When asked as to how black
students were received at this col-
lege, Karona Sanders replied
frankly, “alotof peopledon’t know
how to react to me. So they ignore
me,” to which Joy Sparks added
that she had come to Davidson an
outgoing person, and was surprised

by how she felt other students had
tended to “hurry past, walk next to
the wall, and [not] make eye-con-
tact” with her. Other students on

the panel agreed with this senti-
ment and voiced the feelings of

segregation and exclusion they had
felt since coming to Davidson, all
which seem to culminate in the
universal question: “Am the only
person who feels isolated: here?”

Towards the end of the dis-
cussion, Dr. Fairley expressed her
theory that white students are “sub-
tly pressured” by other white stu-
dents when they get here, so that
even whites who are “comfortable
being around people of color” are
discouraged from doing so. Dr.
Fairley believes that these types of
attitudes cause Davidson students
to “miss out on an informal educa-
tion,” which included “getting to
know people as they are.”

Inclosing, Dr. Fairley stressed
that the racial situation at Davidson
was not unique, but was a national
issue, with which we will have to
face eventually.

Indeed, our sheltered commu-
nity here is only a bubble through
‘which we perceive the world, and
in order to fulfill the expectations
of our generation, each and every-
one of us should strive towards
greater understanding of one an-
other.

Rather than fear what makes
us into different people, we should
explore how ourindividualities can
bring us together.
