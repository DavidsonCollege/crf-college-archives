Rev. C. Grier Davis,
Speaks at Vespers

The Reverend C. Grier Davis,
pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Asheville, N.C., will be
our Vesper preacher this coming
Sunday, April 17.

Dr. Davis was born in Wilmar,
Arkansas in 1906 and graduated
from Davidson in 1927 with an
A.B. degree and went on to study
for two years at the Princeton
Theological Seminary. From there
he went to Union Theological Semi-
nary in Richmond and in 1931 re-
ceived his B.D., Th. M. and Th. D.
degrees.

His first church was the Grace
Covenant Presbyterian Church in
Richmond, where he remained un-
til 1933 when he was called to the
Second Presbyterian Church in
Norfolk, Va. In 1938 he left Nor-
folk and went to the First Pres-
byterian Church in Asheville,
where he is now the pastor.

In 1943 both Davidson and Tus-
culum colleges conferred upon him
the Doctor of Divinity Degree. Dr.
Davis is at present on the Board
of Trustees of Davidson as well as
Montreat College and King Col-
lege and serves on the Board of
Directors of the Mountain Retreat
Association and several other
boards. In 1989 he was moderator
of Asheville Presbytery and in
1952 was made moderator of the
Synod of Appalachia. He is a radio
preacher on The Presbyterian
Hour and a contributing editor of
the Presbyterian Outlook.

Record Number Visits

Europe This Summer

This year will see an all-time|dent group enjoys its own private

record number of students visit-
ing Europe.

Students still interested in join-
ing a chartered college motor tour
of Europe this summer will find
a few spaces still available with
the University Travel Club of New
York.

When the remaining spaces are
booked no more students can be
accommodated because of lack of
critical trans-Atlantic transportion
and suitable European hotel space.

Remaining tours depart New
York on June 29th and 30th. All-in-
clusive cost, including trans-Atlan-
tic tourist class steamers, is $1295.
Air optional for additional $225.
Arrive New York from Europe
September 3rd, and September 7th.

April 10th is deadline for sign-
ing up. For brochure and details
write University Travel Club, 33
East 48th Street, New York City.

The University Travel Club’s
popular tours are for bona fide

Students only. Groups ure limited

to 30 students.

Covering the highlights of u stu-
dent’s “dream trip” in Europe, as
well as interesting off-beat “finds”
that are Europe’s charm, each stu-

Dr. Davis has two sons, the
older of which, Grier, Jr., is a

‘member of this year’s freshman

class.

semble under the direction of Mr.
Paul Peterson from Salem College
in Winston-Salem, will sing during
the Vesper service.

specially chartered modern bus
throughout the tour.

Besides an experienced univer.
sity graduate tour leader escort
from New York, each student
group enjoys the services of its
own multi-lingual tour conductor
throughout Europe and a multi-
lingual bus driver, as well as local
English-speaking sight-seeing
guides.

Private charter buses have
proved the most comfortable and
convenient way of doing Europe.
They allow a freedom of move-
ment not possible any other way.
Another advantage is enabling stu.
dents to see the maximum in ths
lmited time available during thé
brief summer vacation.

while the S.P.E.s, SA.E.s, A.T.0.s
and Phi Delts have 1-0 records.

The S.P.E.s are defending cham.
pions and are favored to repeat
this year, led by the pitching of
lefty Bob Stevenson. The S.P.E.
outfield is considered one of the
best in the league, and they are
definitely the team to beat.

The tennis matches began this
week with the singles competition.
Of the twenty-two entries, ten
boys drew byes in the opening
round. The tournament will be
played in straight elimination, with
points being scored by the in-
dividual players according to the
number of matches they win. The
doubles will be played in a simi-
lar manner after the completion
of the singles.

impossible catches look easy in
centerfield position. His power at
the plate and his defensive ability
have attracted the keen interest of
several major league scouts, but
Bill’s present plans do not include
any pro ball. He has an excellent
opportunity to enter a very
promising business career upon his
graduation, and judging from his
B average, there is no doubt that
Bill will do as outstanding a job
in the business world as he has
done on the athletic field.
