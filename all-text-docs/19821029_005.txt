Poetry
Workshop Here

By SUZANNE DICKEY ’84

Two North Carolina poets, Kate
Blackburn and Robert Grey, editor of
the Southern Poetry Review, visited
Davidson this week to participate in a
poetry workshop and to present their
poems in a reading sponsored by the
Union Literary Arts Committee.

The format of the workshops brought
Ms. Blackburn and Mr. Grey together
with students and faculty to examine
specific poems written by students and
submitted to Blackburn and Grey sever-
al days beforehand. The poems were
critiqued and handed back at the ses-
sion, then there was a group discusssion
and criticism. Most students found the
discussion helpful, and for many it was
the first time they had work critiqued by
notable poets.

The reading took place at 8 p.m. in the
Union. Robert Grey read his selected
poems first. He began with several
poems concerning the theme of Hallo-

ween, and then read several poems
whose themes came from common ob-
jects that were associated with an event

or feeling, objects such as radiators and ©

bicycles.

Kate Blackburn, who will have sev-
eral poems published in the volume
Four North Carolina Women Poets that
will be printed in December, followed
with her poetry which concerned my-
thological themes.

Fraternities
Report Declining

‘Memberships

CPS—After nearly a decade ot
steadily increasing memberships, fra-
ternities at a number of colleges areound
the country are reporting a disappoint-
ing drop in the number of new pledges
last spring and this fall.

Greek membership nationwide is
still up over the low levels of the late
sixties and early seventies, assures Jack
Anson, executive director of the Na-
tional Interfraternity Council.

Membership figures for this ‘year
won’t be available until the spring, but
if the situations at colleges as diverse as
Wesleyan, Loyola-New Orleans, and
the University of Nebraska are any indi-
cation, there are soft spots in greek re-
cruiting.

“We sure hope it’s not (heading
downward),” Anson says, “but you
never know. In 1965, the average size
of a fraternity chapter was 50 members.
But in the early seventies it had dropped
to a low of 34. For about the last ‘ten
years, it’s been increasing again, and
now we're back to an average of 50
members per chapter.”

But on individual campuses, some
chapters are worrying their growth peri-
od may be ending.

“We've seen kind of an up-and-—

down period the last few years,” says
Martin Cunniff, president of the Inter-
fraternity Council at Loyola-New Or-
leans. “In 1979-80, membership really
went up. Then it dipped a bit last year.”

Cunniff says only 12 people showed

up at rush this fall.
“At Wesleyan University, greek
leaders are blaming a low rush turnout
on increasd academic competition.

“Freshmen are inundated” with
school work, says Chuck Wyatt, presi-
dent of Wesleyan’s Psi Upsilon. He be-
lieves many students have delayed
pledging until they get control of their
studies.

Some of the other Wesleyan frater-
nities have also noted drops in the
numbers of pledges this fall. In re-
sponse, some plan stepped-up publicity
efforts and second-semester rushes this
spring.

Rides
Committee
at Work

The rides committee is offering its
services to Davidson students again this
year. The committee has two main func-
tions: to operate the rides board and to
arrange trips to the airport for students
before each break. ;

The rides board is located on the wall
by the Union desk. The board gives stu-
dents the opportunity to advertise for
both rides and riders. Different colored
cards separate the wanted rides from the
wanted riders. These cards are placed
on the board according to states and re-
gions.

~ Rides 16 the airport are available at the
end of each term and before Christmas
break. People who need rides and peo-
ple who can drive can sign up in
Chambers Lobby from Nov.1! to Nov.
