feeling to the drums. Adam Clayton
finally played with his bass sound,
working with distortion and other
effects to an interesting end. Edge’s
guitars cover a staggering range of
sounds — everything from his clas-
sic echo to cutting distortion and
underwater bubble noises. If any-
thing sets the album apart, it’s the
atmosphere added through suppos-
edly random noise. It gives the
music a depth most mainstream
bands don’t address.

I’m not sure that Pop lives up
to Bono’s claim that U2 created of
a.new type of music, but I do think

they have a knack for exploring
different sounds and applying them
to their style of songwriting. If
you’re married to the idea that a
band has to be consistent through-
out their career, either sonically or
thematically, you probably won’t
like Pop. But if you’ve followed
U2 through each of their facelifts
and like watching the procedure,
buy this album.

If I’m hyper-critical it’s be-
cause I want U2 to earn their place
in my heart. I wantto be able to look
past the glitz of their new-found,
electronic (and arrogant) identity
and say, “I don’t care. They make
incredible music.” So far, they’re
doing pretty well.
