On Monday, August 30th the Corella
and Bertram F. Bonner Foundation of
Princeton, New Jersey announced that it is
giving Davidson a gift of $4.92 million. |

This gift, the largest single contribution
to a scholarship fund in the college’s his-
tory, will permanently establish the Bonner
Scholars Program on the Davidson campus
and will count toward the $150 million goal
of the five year Campaign for Davidson.

Along with this gift the Bonner Foun-
dation has challenged Davidson to raise $1
million to be used for a scholarship program
for twenty students in each entering class.

“We plan to raise this additional money

which will supplement the Bonner
Foundation’s generous gift through
Davidson alumni, corporations, and other
foundations,” said Toby Bethea, Director of
Institutional Advancements.

Bethea cited the school’s very success-
ful Bonner scholar program as the main
reason forthe foundation’s gift. Davidson’s
Bonner program is now entering its third
year. In addition to Davidson six other
institutions received similar gifts.

They are: Berry College, Concord Col-
lege, DePauw University, Emory and Henry
College, Spelman College, and the Univer-
sity of Richmond.

Those involved in the Bonner Scholars
programs devote ten hours a week to com-

munity service with special emphasis on
working with children as tutors and men-
tors. They also attend orientations and work-
shops focusing on service and leadership on
campus and in the community.

Bonner Scholar Elizabeth Fleming '95
who volunteers at the Florence Crittendon
Home says, "Through the service work I've
done with the program, I've learned that we
all have gifts we can give our community
and we can all make a difference."

Davidson’s Bonner scholars program
provides need based scholarship support for
students who are willing to perform com-
munity service as part of their college expe-
rience. The gift will provide aid for 75
students.

Freshmen class
exceeds expectations

By Mandy Curtis

The largest class Davidson has
ever seen arrived August 26 to
begin freshman orientation. 452
new students from 40 different
states and 15 foreign countries
spent their first days at Davidson
in lectures, meetings, and mixers.

The anticipated number of stu-
dents in the class of ‘97 was 420,
and as of last June the Admissions
Office had heard from 471 stu-
dents planning to enroll in the fall.
However, the number decreased to
the final enrollment of 452. The
Admissions Office did not go to
the waiting list this year as has
been done in the years past.

The male to female ratio is
almost 60/40 in the new class.
According to Dean Terry, the gap
between men and women is “larger
than we projected.” However, with
more women than men in the class
of ‘96, the overall balance of the
student body has been retained.

The large class was difficult
to house this year, according to the
Residence Life Office. 63 fresh-
man came to school knowing the
name of not one roommate but of
two. This year there are 21 triples,
four rooms of women and 17 of
men, in Belk, Little, and Cannon.

Some classes have also been
affected by the number of fresh-
men. According to Dean Terry,
the biggest problems have been in
biology and math, which sopho-
mores and juniors have needed to
fulfill requirements. Terry said
that because all upperclassmen get
picks ofclasses in the spring, many
freshmen have not been able to get
a. few of these required classes.
“There has been a problem in sci-
ence, where you can’t raise the
ceiling due to the number of lab
.. Spaces,” said Terry.

Davidson is gradually increas-
ing the total enrollment of the stu-
_ dent body; however, the class of
‘97 does not affect that increase.
According to John Kelton, chair of
the Enrollment Committee, the
College has projected an increase

to 1600 by the year 2000.

The size of the new class was
not intended to hasten the process,
and next year’s class will be
smaller.

53 of the freshmen were vale-
dictorians of their highschool class;
50% scored between 1200 and 1300
onthe SAT; the average highschool
class rank wasin the top 5-10%. In
the class there is an all-state violin-
ist, a published novelist, a nation-
ally ranked figure skater, many
varsity athletes, and over 40 senior
class presidents.

“My impression is that they
are a very good group of people,
very enthusiastic,” comments Dean
Terry. Kelton remarks, “We’re
delighted. We give Admissions an
A+ for recruitment.”

In the President’s Welcome
address to the class of ‘97, Dean of
Admissions, Nancy Cable Wells

presented the freshmen. Accord-

ing to Wells, “Each of them is
ready for the rigor and the joy of
academic challenges and personal
growth that lies ahead of them at
Davidson.”

Ben & Jerry's finally to open on Main St.

By Mary McCrory

Chocolate chip cookie
dough...rainforest crunch...cherry
Garcia...chunky monkey... Fla-
vors like these have been the rally-
ing call of discriminating ice cream
consumers everywhere. For years,
Davidson students in search of a
Ben and Jerry’s store had to drive
into Charlotte to have Vermont’s
finest on a cone. Soon, however,
Ben and Jerry’s ice cream will
only be a short walk away.

No date has been set for the
opening of the store at 202 South
Main Street yet, but owner Phyllis
Schultz hopes to open “as soon as
possible.” She will not give any
date for the opening, because much
work is left to be done on the store
tocomply with strict county health
codes. Schultz, who also owns the

two Charlotte stores, has been in-
terested in the Davidson area for
some time. “I liked having my
stores be part of a community, and
strip centers don’t offer that,” she
says.

Her new store will occupy the
space where Tinkham’s Curiosity
Shop used to be, but Schultz con-
sidered other locations, too. Be-
fore property on Main Street be-
came available, she considered
buildinga kiosk in front of the Post
Office.

She was reluctant to go
through with such a plan, because
not everyone was pleased with it.
“There was controversy over giv-
ing up that park-like space,”
Schultz explained. Luckily,
Tinkham’s became vacant at just
the right time. “It isn’t just a sum-

mer ice cream place,” she says
about Ben and Jerry’s,"We like to
think of it as an ice cream café.”
Although ice cream will be preva-
lent, thestore will also offer freshly
baked cookies and brownies, as
well as hot chocolate, espresso,
capuccino, and coffee.

Tuts WEEK

Enriched
LOL enjoys
sixth summer

By Leigh Rawdon
Love of Learning had yet an-
other successful summer program.
The 1993 four week program held
in July saw not only a well planned
and valuable experience for its stu-
dents, but also witnessed tangible

benifits which included an en-

dowed scholarship for graduates
to attend Davidson, a significant
financial gift from Nationsbank, a
visit from a Washington Post col- .
umnist. 1
Davidson College trustee W.
Olin Nisbett II and his wife Marian
established a four year scholarship
available for one Love of Learning
per graduating class. The $300,000
endowment provides the first
Nisbet scholarship for Jermecia
Beachem who grew up in Char-
lotte but spent her last two years at
Scarsdale High School in New
York working with the STEP pro-
gram (Student Transfer Educa-
tional Plan). Beachem credits the
Love of Learning program with
preparing her “to do college level
work, ... dealing with home sick-
ness, and living witha roommate.”
On July 11, Nationsbankspon-
sored a Sunday afternoon packed
with barbeque, music, and team
building activities for Love of
Learning students, family, and —
staff. The picnic on Chambers
lawn provided an opportunity for
Nationsbank to present $250,000

to the program designed to prepare
