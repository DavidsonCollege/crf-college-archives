True talent:
Moonlighting for the
Names Quilt

By Matthew Eirich

The annual Faculty/Staff tal-
ent show, as suggested by Stew-
ardship Coordinator Meg Kimmel,
was “very much likea quilt.” There
were serious performances and hu-
morous acts; some played the pi-
ano, others the guitar or mandolin;
somé people sang or read poetry,
and someone juggled ... his chil-
dren.
entertaining performances was
held on Thursday evening in Love
auditorium to benefit the AIDS
Memorial Quilt project.

To bring the Quiltto Davidson,
the college applied to the AIDS
Memorial Quilt project headquar-
ters in San Fransico. The college
also had to promise to raise at least
$10,000 (with a goal of $15,000)
for various AIDS-related organi-
zations in the area and to conduct

AIDS education on campus, ac- .

cording to Sherry Malushizky,
Assisstant Director for Programs.

The talent show was the brain-
child of Rev. Brenda Tapia, head
of the Love of Learning program
‘and assistant chaplain. “The talent
show allows the faculty and staff
to work together and have fun,”
Tapia said, adding that the show

This eclectic grouping of

has always been a very “‘success-
ful” fund-raiser.

The show, with the theme
“Panels of Reflection,” began with
an introduction and a humorous
story about his recent trip to China
by Master of Ceremonies Ed
Kania, the Controller.

Dean of Faculty Robert Will-
iams and his wife Ann sang three
songs to the accompaniment of
Williams’ guitar.

Chaplain Rob Spach, Ruth
Pittard, Catherine Turner, and
Katherine Cooke recited selected
poems of Wendell Barrett.

Dr. John and Glenda
Wertheimer took the stage to per-
form the Spanish love song
“Germa,” which means “‘gem” in
Spanish. The Wertheimers dedi-
cated the song toachildhood friend
of Glena’s who died of AIDS.

Following the Wertheimers
were the Giduz Family Jugglers, a
rather literal title as the audience
was soon to learn. The group con-

‘sisted of Bill Giduz from College

Relations, his young daughter and
his 11-month old son, Luke.

The act began with Giduz
swinging his daughter over his back
and onto his shoulders. The audi-

ence was gripped with nervous at-
tention as Giduz swung his daugh-
ter around and erupted in applause
when the trick had been success-
fully—and safely—performed.

The audience was to receive
no relief from the tension, how-
ever. Giduz next swung his daugh-
ter in front of him from side to side
until he did an “around the world,”
spinning his daughter a full 180
degrees.

Giduz then put his daughter
aside and picked-up his son Luke.
He first performed a balancing act
holding Lukein his right hand away
from his body. Luke looked out
into the crowd happily as he seemed
to float above the stage.

Giduz proceeded to tell the
audience that he was going tojuggle
his son, an announcement which
heightened the crowd’s attention
tenfold. Juggling two balls with
his right hand, Giduz held Luke
close to his stomach with his left
hand and dramatically switched
the Luke to the right and the balls
to the left.

For the finale, Giduz produced
a wooden board and a cylinder and
balanced himself on it intending to
juggle three bowling pins. He then

invited his daughter to climb on
putting her feet on the board in-
side his. They shortly gained
their balance and Giduz success-
fully juggled the bowling pins.
The Giduz Family Jugglers left
the stage receiving a boisterous
round of applause.

International week concluded
on Saturday with its centerpiece:
‘the International Festival. Stu-
dents, faculty, and Davidson resi-
dents came together to celebrate
the heritage of over 23 countries.

Activities at the festival ranged
from getting a picture taken in an
Indian sari to getting one’s name
written in Pakistani. Anyone who
attended the events received expo-
sure to music, food, and informa-
tion from around the world.

Aparna Iyer, who performed
an Indian dance in the 900 Room,
said “Every international student
has twosides, and the festival gives
us an opportunity to show the other
side.” Without the festival, many
people do not realize that the per-
son living next door could have
unseen talents from another cul-
ture.

Ruth Pittard, liaison to the in-
ternational students, believes that

this year’s festival was the “best

ever” as compared to the previous
11 festivals. More countries were
represented than ever before, anda
tremendous number of people at-
tended the event.

Junior Alfredo Urbino said the
festival was similar to “going ona
discovery trip because of the expo-
sure to all the different cultures.”
Senior Amanda Grant agreed about
how fun the festival was and said,
“I cannot believe that I waited until

minutes

senior year to come.”

This year’s festival was
ogranized by the Union Board
Cultural Events Committee
chaired by Jenny Everett. She
explained that “‘the festival took a
lot of work, but it went smoothly
and everybody seemed to have a
great time.” Although Interna-
tional Festival has passed, the
Cultural Events Committee has
many more events planned to
quench your international desire.

Bravely following the Giduz
family was faculty assistant Kristi
Newton, singing the gospel song
“Daystar.”

Dr. Michael ‘Poimzacn played
three songs from his native Cypress
on the mandolin.

Doris Hermann, an interna-
tional student from Germany, was
the only student to perform in the
show. Hermann performed “I Don’t
Know How to Love Him” from
Jesus Christ Superstar accompa-
nied on piano by Dean Williams.

Dr. Donand Meg Kimmel were
the next performers. According to
the program, they were to do “dra-
matic reading of several poems.”
This was a tongue-in-cheek descrip-
tion; they were absurdly serious in
order to be funny. Nowhere was
this more apparent than in their fi-
nale, .a rendition of “I Got You,
Babe” by Sonny and Cher. They
delivered the song in such an abso-
lutely serious manner that it became

Music Review

It’s no Monster hit

by Tom Bavis

R.E.M.’s new album Mon-
ster should silence any remaining
skeptics—for a few more years at
least—who snottily predicted that
the kings of American rock were
losing it. Less than two years
after the release of their over-
whelmingly calm and beautiful
Automatic for the People, R.E.M.
has made the exact opposite al-
bum. Monster rocks at least as
‘hard.as Document, and is as shab-
bily recorded at many points as
Dead Letter Office. Michael
Stipe’s singing is as indecipher-
able as it is on Murmur. And,
most importantly to the album’s
sound, guitarist Peter Buck took
the helm in the studio, serving up

as many layers of distorted guitars
as My Bloody Valentine or Sonic
Youth.

’ But, alas, Monster as a whole is
not superlative compared to the rest
of the R.E.M. catalog. What the
band gains in admiration it loses in
song quality. I must disagree with
Rolling Stone’s claim that “there is
not a throwaway in the bunch.”
“Crush With Eyeliner,” anexcercise
in the raw power of distortion, has
nary a melody nor catchy rhythm in
earshot. The same sad fate falls
upon “Circus Envy.” In many pre-
vious R.E.M. songs that had these
symptoms, like Document’s
“Oddfellows Local 151,” Michael
Stipe’s words could usually distract
