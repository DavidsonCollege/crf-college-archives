‘David Ethridge hopes to use
grant money to study the effects of
drought in India, Sudan, and Indo-
nesia. Inspired by his summer
experiences in India, where he had
a chance to see the awful:condi-

created in the small villages,
David decided to try for a Watson

drought’s effects on subsistence
farmers in three very different

Clara Broniec first became
interested in the work of the Aus-

she spent her junior year in Ger-

an artist, but an ecologist and

While she has danced since ‘the

abroad in Montpellier, France that.

she first became interested in
undertaking such a project, for it
was then that she was exposed to
