Cochran Selected |
To Pursue Course

Famous Davidson Athlete Chosen
From Seventy-Five

Miller Cochran has had another laurel
placed on his head. This time by the
Air Corps of the United States Army,
which recently chose him as one of the
twenty men most worthy to coritinue in
the aviation course at Randolph Field,
Texas. From seventy-five men that en-
tered the course six months ago, twenty
were selected to, continue the study
which holds as its‘ goal a position as offi-
cer in the United States Air Corps.

While in Davidson, Miller made him-
self known in many fields of endeavor,
the most noteworthy were track and R.
O. T. C. As a member of the class of
34 Cochran set’ the school record for
both the shot put and the discus. These
records were followed by his breaking
the state shot record,

In the Reserve Officers Training Corps
he was a cadet captain. For the whole
of his senior year he acted in the ca-
pacity of the captain of the Davidson
Military Band. This position is a great
honor in itself, and worthy of keeping
his name in the minds of Davidson stu-
dents for years to come. However, all
his work as captain of the band is over-
shadowed by his brilliant record as an
athlete.

At the end of the year’s training Mil-
ler hopes to enter the regular army as
an officer. This will only be possible
if the present enlistment in the army is
increased and thus make it necessary to
accept more officers into active service.
If, however, the opportunity of entering
the army is available at the end of
this training, Cochran will enlist to serve
for at least a two-year périod, or he
may devote his life to the work as an
officer in the Army Air Corps.

Miller Cochran has been in the train-
ing school about six months, occupied
with a course that requires one year to
complete. Miller is now half through
with the instruction and probably the
end of the next six months’ period will
find this son of Davidson an officer in
the greatest air service in the world.
