JACKIE COOGAN COMING
IN HIS BIGGEST FILM

With more than $400,000 spent on the
construction of the sets alone, Jackie
Coogan’s latest picture, “Long Live the
King,” his first under the $1,500,000 Metro
contract which was given him recently, |
ought to fulfill all?the advance reports |
which were broadcasted throughout the!
country at the time this picture was in|
the making in Hollywood,

That it is an unusually lavish and beau-
tiful production is substantiated by the
fact that it contains several exact dupli-
cations of famous European structures.
One is of the famous castle of Neusch-
wanstein in Bulgaria, a landmark in!
European architecture, another of the
world-renowned opera house at Dresden,
Germany, and still another of the beau-
tiful Cathredral in Herzegovina, the
shrine of millions of Eurepean visitors.
A special research staff sailed from)
Europe for Hollywood at the time pro- |
duction was begun with exact designs
and plans for the duplication of these
famous structures.

“Long Live the King” is an adaptation ,
of Mary Roberts Rinehart's famous |
novel of the same name. It was directed
by Victor Schertzinger from the con-
tinuity by C. Gardner Sullivan and Eve
Unsell and photographed by Frank Good
and Robert Martin. William Van
Brincken was research expert and J. J.
Hughes art director. The picture was.
produced for Metro under the personal
supervision of Jack Coogan, Sr.

fact that in 1873, Thomas A. Wilson, a stu- |
dent in the college, was withdrawn from
college on account of inattention to duty.
Woodrow Wilson completed the year at Da-|
vidson, averaging 91 1-2 in his studies.

Several stories are told of Wilson's ath-
letic record. Wilson, playing on the Fresh-
man team, loafed on the paths and was
caught at the plate, thereby losing the game.
The coach did not appreciate Wilson's indif-
ference and attacked him as harshly as have
his political assailants in later years. In an-,
other game, Wilson, by a spectacular catch
of a line drive won the game.

Although at Davidosn only a year, Wilson
never forgot the little Presbyterian college. |
Seventy Davidson students went to Wash- |
ington to his first inauguration in 1913, and |
along with the students of Princeton, Johns |
Hopkins and Virginia were assigned a place |
near the head of the college section. As |
soon as he saw the Davidson banner, the |
President rose and stood at attention until |
‘the Davidson contingent had passed. |

On May 20, 1916, when President Wilson |
spoke at the Mecklenburg Day celebration |
in Charlotte, he visited his alma mater jor

SENIORS HIT THE ROAD

DURING EXAM WEEK ;

There comes a time in the life of every
Senior when he longs to lay .aside the
quill and scroll and journey afar to the
land of his nativity.

It came to pass in the Ides of January,
about the time of the biennial examina-
tions that Eugene the Regent said
Victor the Brown:

“Come, let us depart from this place
hence. Three days’ journey west shall
we go, toward the setting sun. Let us
continue by way of the flivver-path till
we come to Tennessee, the land of fair

| horses and fast women.”

And so they traveled thus, by way
Atlanta and Chattanooga, where a bliz-
zard overtook them. Whereat they took
for themselves haven in a pullman until
they should arrive at their destination.

The women were fast but the war-
riors were faster and unscratched they
arrived again at their fortress and domi-
cile about the time of the Kalends of
February.

And it came to pass about the same
time that the wanderlust hath smitten
doughty warriors from South
And so the duke of Walthall
and Sir’ Galloway set out for the land
of the peach tree. By land and water
did they travel, across rivers with many
a Ford until they came to a palmetto
tree. There, at Columbia they embarked
on the ship of the double rail and did

continue their journey until that a ripe}
peach fell on the track and did wreck the}

train. ’
Whereat they alighted and tarried for
a fortnight. After which they reembark-

ed and with reverse English did retravel |

their backtrack until the spires of David-
son bade them alight and make merry.
A certain other was at the same time

| afflicted with a desire to visit Agnes
| of Scott.

This gallant courtier set him
out and anon he arrived at Atlanta by
devious ways and means. Thereat he
was seduced by the School of Technol-
ogy. Bunt single-handed he beat them
off and continued his way to the house
of Scott.

He was welcomed by Agnes and re-
mained four days in the vicinity of the
neighborhood making much merriness.
Then continuing his quest he came to
Asheville in the land of the sky and near
unto Montreat. And at Montreat he

‘ly for it strengthened a man’s heart. And
after a few days and a night this pilgrim
also returned and took up his abode in
the barracks.

And yet another did venture forth up-
on the asphalt trail in the days of the
Ides of the first month, yea until the
Kalends of the second month did he
stray afar. The scion of the house of
Hudgins did turn his footsteps north-
ward toward the pole star until he came
to Richmond in the heart the old
dominion, For two days and nights did
the redoutable Perrin walk two-score
miles and ten without sleep or repose.
He captured him a lizzie of tin and ere
the setting of the third sun was in his
native city of Ri¢hmond. And he dwelt
in the house of his father a fortnight
and a day.

And this pilgrim returned and there

BAH JOVE MAKES HISTORY IN
RUMPLE DORMITORY

Quite a disturbance occurred in the
cast side of Rumple the other day when
several of the inmates of that quaint
old dorm came into the hall and were
about to be floated out. On account of
that dorm being so subject to fire, and
there also having been various prophecies
that it would be burned cre long, even
the the institution
fearing the same, it was thought Wise to

some of leaders of
install a systém of sprinklers, whieh, in
case of fire would automatically set into
action and extinguish the flames, and
those students halls had an
idea that the sprinklers were being tried
out for the first time. Glad they were
to know that the authorities of the col-
jlege had such an interest at heart. to
authorize the installation of these mod
perm means of fighting fire.

But vit so happened that water was
flowing freely through the veins of the
cumpus, and in fact the tall tank had
}overflown, proving a super-abundance of
| water, a thing most unusual aroundhere.
It also happened that “Bah Jove” Rogers
jhad taken very strenuous exercise, hav

ing gone’ around the golf course once,
and since he was feeling so tired and in
extreme need of a bath he proceeded to
take one. He turned on the water full
blast. Now every one knows that he is
a slow thinker. He even staid on Eng-
lish IIT exam until seven o'clock, an ex-
am which any should be able
finish in oo minutes at most. So he
could not get his brain to work quickly
enough to see that there was a steady

stream of water flowing out into the
hall and down to the second and first
floors, It was “Bah Jove". taking a

bath, and not the new automatic sprink-
lers which was flooding Rumple and giv-
ing it the once over.

I ROGER BACON

| 1214-1294

English philosopher and man

of science. Studied at Oxford

| and the University of Paris.
Wrote the Opus Majus, Opus

| Minus, Opus Tertium, and

| many other treatises,

|
if

More than a million dol-
| lars a year is devoted to

research by the General
| Electric Company in
| order that the giant—

| electricity—may be
made more and more
useful to mankind.

For this he was
‘sent to prison

Roger Bacon may not have invented gun-
powder, as has been claimed by some biog-
raphers of the famous Franciscan friar, but
he exploded some of the outstanding errors
of thirteenth century thought. Because of
his advanted teachings, Bacon spent many

years of his life in prison.

In an age of abstract speculation he boldly
asserted the mathematical basis of all the

sciences.

But even mathematical calcula-

tion, he showed, must be verified by ex-
periment, which discovers truths that spec-

ulation could never reach.

In the Research Laboratories of the Gen-
eral Electric Company, Bacon’s principles
are followed in every experimental investi-

gation.

The gas-filled electric lamp and

the electron tube were worked out on
paper, but it was experimental verification
of the underlying mathematical theory that
made electric illumination, radio broadcast-
ing and X-rays what they are today.
