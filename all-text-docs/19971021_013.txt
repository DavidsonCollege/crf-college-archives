The campus atmosphere: for four weeks, soccer was No. 1

‘You walked to class and your

hair would stand on end’

This is another in an ongoing se-
ries commemorating the fifth anniver-
sary of the men’s soccer team's miracu-
lous run to the 1992 NCAA Final Four
at Richardson Field.

For four magical weeks in No-
vember and December of 1992, little
else mattered.

For once in this school’s history,
academics — even in the heart of the
stretch run, with finals rapidly approach-
ing — took a decided back seat

In this bastion of apathy, an envi-
ronment practically defined by ho-hum
support of athletics, the men’s soccer
team, for the most fleeting of moments
in the scope of the College’s 165-year
history, was absolutely, positively No
I.
the
eighth-ranked liberal arts
college in the nation,
home to 22 Rhodes
Scholars, was sweptaway
by the soccer squad’s
most unlikely run and
thrown into a state of soc-
cer-centric delirium — a |

Davidson,

lotte Observer termed
“December Dementia.”

No Wildcat team
had ever been to a Final
Four before and no Wildcat team has
ever been since.

As coach Charlie Slagle put it in
August, “Here's little Davidson in a
place they shouldn't have been in the
whole scheme of things.”

Truly, this was a once-in-a-life-
time opportunity. And Davidson, town
and college, treated it as such.

“There have been a lot of exciting
things to happen at Davidson College
over the years,” Main Street barber Ken
Norton said. “This is certainly one of
the biggest.”

“The sense on campus, it was
amazing,” said Matthew Spear, a
midfielder on that team who now works
as the vice president of Integrity Sports
Marketing here in Davidson. ‘You
walked to class and your hair would
stand on end. People looked at you
different. Théy were supportive — no
one was jealous — but you sensed that
you were being watched.

“And for us, that was brand new.
We were student-athletes. We'd never
been considered athletes solely. But at
that point, we were athletes solely.”

“Everyone was enthused,” added
10-goal-scorer John Sampers in a re-
cent telephone interview from Upper
Montclair, N.J. “It was electrifying —
a moment that would be difficult to
repeat.”

If not impossible.

Upon beating North Carolina St.
in the national quarterfinals Sunday,
Nov. 29, in Raleigh, 150 extra tickets

- part of Davidson’s unexpected share
as a participant in the sold-out event at
Richardson Field — went on sale Mon-
day at 7:30 a.m. at Baker. Thirty stu-
dents spent the night outside the ticket
office. The hot commodities were gone
in 45 minutes.

“The soccer team has given stu-
denis something to get
behind and a chance to
show off how supportive
we are,” Kelly Thomp-
son, one of those who
spent the night, told the
Davidsonian.

The overnight rush
for tickets set off a week
of nervous excitement
and anticipation, as the
campus began counting
down to the Wildcats’
semifinal meeting with
San Diego on Friday.

The brothers of Kappa Alpha, of
which 10 of the team’s 11 starters were
members, unknowingly began a
Davidson tradition by spending the wee
hours of Thursday morning painting
big red paws from Exit 30 all the way to
Main Street and then around campus.

“It took us until 5 a.m.,” sopho-
more KA Lee Sutton told the Observer.
“But it was worth it.”

Meanwhile, thanks to the power-
ful Davidson mind and some green paint,
a group of self-appointed student prog-
nosticators did some Interstate-77 sign
revisions — the “Davidson College:
Home of the NCAA Soccer Champion-
ships” sign suddenly read, “Davidson
College: Home of the NCAA Soccer
Champions” instead.

“The place went crazy,” said Rob
Ukrop, who led the nation in scoring in
1992 with 31 goals and 72 points.
“People put banners up everywhere.
Everyone was wishing us good luck.

Everything was electric.

“And it was people who you had
no idea were soccer fans. But it never
felt like a bandwagon. There was a
sense of community.”

“Professors I never had came up to
me to wish me good luck,” Ukrop con-
tinued.

While many particularly hard-
headed professors refused to let the
overwhelming soccer mania interfere
with their academic schedules —
Sampers, along with several other Wild-
cats, took an exam Friday morning —
some saw ample reason to cancel, or at
least readjust, class time.

One ‘of them, English professor
Anthony Abbot, told the Davidsonian,
“It seems only fair to rearrange our
classes in light of this historic event.”

“It was unbelievable,” Slagle said,
“andI’ve been here a lot of years. There
were signs in windows. There were
people who were just really pumped up
about this whole thing.

The campus was abuzz.

“T think we lost a little bit of our
home field advantage because our guys
had to say thank you so many times to
people wishing them luck.”

So Slagle took his team to the

Hampton Inn, where the Wildcats spent
Thursday night. “We just needed to get
away from campus,” Slagle said.

“For four weeks, Davidson be-
came one,” miracle-maker goalie Alex
Deegan said.

“The whole campus was rallying
behind something. It gave people hope.
The other students actually felt like
they were part of it. It made it great-for
the student body behind this average
Joe group. You could just feel the
excitement in the air.”

And what is often forgotten is that
Davidson’ athletic department and soc-
cer program was hosting this event —a
taxing responsibility in itself.

In addition to accepting congratu-
lations and well-wishes from the entire
community, “we were also setting up
for the Final Four, the biggest event
Davidson had ever hosted here on cam-
pus,” Slagle explained.

“I was getting in excess of 120
calls a day from people. About the
tournament, wishing us luck, whatever
it was. It was a zoo.”

In a way, Davidson threw its own
suprise party.

“I’ve never seen anything like it
since then,” said Ryan Northington, a

mere rookie: who booted what turned
out to be the decisive penalty kick against
Coastal Carolina in the Round of 16.
“You can’t avoid sounding cheesy.
Everyone was so united.

“There was justa great atmosphere,
even among people who could care less
about soccer. It was one of the most
amazing things that has ever happened
to me.”

Davidsonian-columnist Matt
Bumstead, looking back on the campus
atmosphere surrounding the Final Four
in his Jan. 25, 1993 column, wrote:

“For days on end, we couldn’t
study; we couldn’t even sleep at night
without first counting the days until our
Wildcat soccer team would again take
us on the best ride of our lives...

“For four weeks, the angry de-
bates over racism, sexism, alcohol, and
politics cooled off and took a back seat
in casual discussion, where attention
was turned instead to Rob Ukrop’s bi-
cycle kick, Alex Deegan’s heart-stop-
ping saves against Coastal and possibly
the greatest sports happening in
Davidson history — our trip to the Final
Four.”

Players point to that virtual fan-
player oneness as a major driving force
behind. the team’s remarkable
postseason success.

“Our fans have been just amaz-
ing,” midfielder Phelps Sprinkle said in
the press conference after the loss to
San Diego, a game attended by 8,150
people — nearly 7,000 of whom were
cheering for the Wildcats.

“They’re one of the main reasons
we've done so well. We've had a lot
more fan support than almost anyone
we've played.”

“You could even consider it kind
of like a 12th man,” all-conference de-
fender Craig Omli said recently from ~
Winston-Salem.

“Even in the game we lost, I've
never had that sense or feeling (of such
support), There’s nothing that’s touched
that since.”

“Walking on the field —
Richardson Field— 8,000 people there,
probably 7,000 screaming for us — is
justa great feeling, something I'll never
forget,” Spear says in the closing frames
of Homeward Bound, the video that
vividly recaps the Wildcats’ run.

“There was so muchenergy, [could
not have gotten tired that night running
a marathon. I hope people listening to
this can experience that amount of en-

£tgy, that amount of encoura ement...
