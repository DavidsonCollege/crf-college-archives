THE LIBRARY HABIT.

We heard a Senior remark a few days
ago, that if he was again beginning his
college course, he would make it a strict
rule of his work to spend a certain
amount of his time each day in the
library and reading room. This is by
no means an exceptional case, but man
after man will make this statement after
four vears, and it is worth our while to
seriously consider the reasons why this
is true.

The college has a well equipped
library, with an exceptionally well
selected number of books, and every
condition would seem to be such as to
induce men to use the privileges offer-
ed. But the library records show that
a great number of men are not taking
advantage of these opportunities, and
like the present Senior class, many men
will want to turn back and start anew,
when they realize too late the mistake
which has been made.

It is easy to make the mistake of put-
ting off this reading until the years of
the upper classes, and then to find the
time so crowded with .other things that
no time can be found for extra reading.
The habit should be formed in the first
two years, and there will then be no
difficulty about the last two years.

Several books can he found in the
librarv which, in a general way, will be
a guide among the large number of
books offered, and no better time can be
spent than in reading one or more of
these. so that the lines of reading fol-
lowed may be those in which the reader
has especial interest.

Tt will be a good rule if each man
will visit the library at certain intervals
and see if he cannot find baoks there
which interest him, and the information
and pleasure obtained in this way will be
worth as much as any one “ticket” offer-
ed in the reeular course. As well, the
“library habit” will be formed, which
will he of service throughout life.

WILMINGTON CLUR.

On Wednesday night. the 13th, the
thirteen students from Wilmington or-
ganized a Wilmineton Club for the
double purpose of fellowship and desire
to add something to the interest that the
peonle of Wilmington have in Davidson
College. W. C. Rourk was elected
president; Jno. Thames, secretary; and
Dalzel Sprunt, treasurer. A committee
was appointed to make arrangements for
a “feed” to be held in the near future.

fast game.

On Monday afternoon the Freshmen
were in turn defeated by the
team, the score being 39 to 25. The
Tunior team, although light, has shown
itself capable of holding its own against
the others, and worked together well
throughout. For the Juniors the stars
were Young and Price, and for the
Freshmen, Hall again made a_ good
showing.

Offcers for the four teams have been
elected as follows: Senior, Hoyt, cap-
tain; Dumas, manager. Junior, Nes-
hit, captain; Mattison, manager. Soph,
D. Sprunt, captain; Hengeveld, man-
ager. Freshmen, Hall, captain; Potts,
manager.

ORCHESTRA AND GLEE CLUB.

The Orchestra is getting into shape
rapidly now. It has been practicing
hard for some time, and will be in con-
dition soon to give a first-class concert.

The Glee Club is also doing well.
The material this year far exceeds any
that has been out for some years, and it
bids fair to develop into a Glee Club
superior to any that has gone from these
old walls.

The Orchestra and Glee Club are
planning to take a trip South some time
next month. The date has not yet been
decided on, but they are anticipating a
verv pleasant trip.

They have secured a cancert at
Queens College for Thanksgiving night,
which they are looking forward to with
pleasure.

Next March the Club takes its long
trin. Tt will probably go towards Ashe-
ville, stopping along the way at several
of the towns. There will be several con-
certs given on the “Hill” during the
session.
