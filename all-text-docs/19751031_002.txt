eeize searches for energy savin

Power consumption proves

‘a real headache’

By CHARLES KENNON
Staff Writer

In the face of what could be
a long cruel winter, Davidson
College has acted to minimize
the effects of any possible
energy crisis.

“In the last five years the
College’s energy costs have
more than doubled,’’ accor-
ding to Director of the Physi-
cal Plant Grover C. Meetze,
dr.

“Now energy policy and the
budget go hand in hand. In
addition to increase in fuel and
electricity rates we have had
substantial rises in our energy
consumption,’’ Meetze conti-
nued.

He cited the E. H. Little
Library and the use of more
lighting around the campus
as being responsible for most
of the increase in the college’s
electric bill.

“As a general statement the
new library is a large in-
crease--an increase in overall
load and hours of operation,”
said Meetze.

‘‘But that isn’t the whole
picture. The lighting in the
library is designed to heat the
building. So there isn’t a
larger demand on the steam
plant, and that’s a savings.
Its at the cost of the power bill
but its a savings during the
winter.”

According to Meetze, the
new union hasn’t been a major

new expense, ‘‘because there
has been little additional oper-
ating cost overits days asa
library. The air-conditioning
was already there and other
costs, such as lighting, are
about the same.”

Over the past several years
Davidson College has installed
new lights to better illuminate
the campus at night. This has
added to the electric bill but
Meetze explained that the
college kept them from
costing much more.

“We bought a large number
of lights at a good price and
then we had our own people
install them. We put them in a
half the normal cost of a
contractor. Also, we have
low-level lighting that is both
attractive and less expen-
sive,”’ he said.

Meetze admitted that ‘‘po-
wer consumption is a real
headache.” He indicated that
the school is embarking on a
long process of searching for
ways to cut that consumption.

“We're spending the bigger.

part of this year investigating
methods of reducing power
usage and costs.

““We’re looking at every
building, especially the library
to see if we can cut the number
of footcandles used there.
We've cut out some of the
lighting on Richardson Plaza.

“Now we are looking into a
new sodium-filled lamp made

Energy to burn: E.H.Little Library calls for drastic increase in

by General Electric. It gives
off an orange glow and is more
efficient than the normal mer-
cury vapor lamps.

‘“‘We are going to start
metering individual buildings
on campus, something not
now done. I’d like to see
students help study ways to
get better use from Chambers.

‘‘We can’t turn it off with
the language lab, computer,
and study rooms but I’m sure
something can be done to use
it more efficiently.

“For areas on campus not
used too often I’d like to see a
four-hours-on, four-hours-off
power schedule adopted.
There are.a lot of little things
we might do that could add up
to substantial savings. Now
we are trying to get informa-
tion so if the situation worsens
we can make recommenda-
tions to cut expenses,’ Meetze
reiterated.

Davidson College has made

. arrangements to replace the

current heating fuel, natural
gas, with fuel oil for this and
coming winters.

Natural gas comes primarily
from Texas and allocations in
Eastern states for this winter
are going to be cut by a large

percentage. The college had a
gas contract that had “inter-
ruptable rates,’’ meaning that
the supply can be cut off.

Meetze anticipated this
problem and stated that his
plans would hopefully ‘‘out-
guess the future.”

‘‘We will have oil this
winter, although dorms will
again be rationed. Still, if
there is a crisis this school
won’t close down, and I’m
confidant for next year despite
the tenuousness of our na-
tion’s oil supplies.”’

Meetze and his staff have
had meetings with represen-
tatives of Duke Power Com-
pany to get electrical distri-
bution points moved nearer to
campus.

This would cut the line lose,
or power lost from the process
of transferring the voltage
through various transformers.

It would also facilitate the.

metering of individual buil-
dings to see if some areas are
éonsuming a disproportionate
amount of power.

The energy situation has
forced a slow-down of certain
projects around campus, inc-
luding that of air-conditioning
more dormitories.

‘‘We've asked for money to
do this, and the Duke Foun-
dation is one possible source,
but we haven’t decided when
we'll go ahead if the money
comes.

‘‘We haven’t decided which
dorm to air-condition, but
Duke is a good possibility.”

Meetze explained that he
was conducting some long-
range planning for possible
alternative sources of power.
He is working with members
of the physical plant on a
research project involving
solar panels.

“I’m running a study of
existing hardware and meth-
ods of improving it. There are
a lot of flat roofs on campus,
especially the library, and
solar energy could be utilized
to heat hot water there, among
other things.

‘“‘I’d like to be ready to
implement a profitable system
if the situation warrants and
technology develops ade-
quately. We don’t have any
solar panels now, but I know
some firms that sell glass and
it is concieveable that we could
build our own,”’ he concluded.
