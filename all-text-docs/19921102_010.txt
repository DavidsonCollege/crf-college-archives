Production of Rashoman
Entertains Full House

By Chris Hoveland
The Theatre Department pre-
sented five shows of

Rashomonover the past two week-
ends. The players in last Thursday
night’s performance demonstrated
talent and vitality to a responsive
full house in Hodson Hall. Dr.
Joseph Gardner designed and di-
rected the play, with technical di-
rection and lighting by Ronnie
Higdon. Freshman Karl Ruchcom-
posed and performed the music
(on electronic drums), and Katie
Schlee designed the costumes.
Rashomon, written by Fay and
Michael Kanin, takes place in the
Orient before the Rashomon Gate,
where three characters, a priest
(Scott Lenhart), woodcutter
(Jonathan Brooks) and wigmaker
(Bobby Ramsay) question the truth
behind the testimonies of several
characters’ involvement ina treach-

erous incident. The facts of: the
case remain open-ended, but in
essence, an infamous bandit (Ed
Cunningham) attacks and binds up
a Samauri warrior (David
Tweedie), thereby forcing him to
witness subsequent sexual involve-
ment between the bandit and the
warrior’s wife (Amanda Davis).
The warrior is killed. Thereafter,
the question of whose honor is lost
to whom is answered through self-
interest-tainted responses of the
involved characters. As we shall
see, each character’s assessmentis
hardly worthy of its claim to truth.

The bandit presented his side
ofthe story first. Cunningham was
the perfect man for the role, cap-
turing all the mannerisms and an-
tics involved in portraying the
bandit’s violent yet comic disposi-
tion. The bandit, quite proud of his
image as looter and sexual con-

MOVIE REVIEW:
Celluloid Hero: Four Thumbs Up

By Will Lazenby and Mary
McCrory

The job of movie reviewer is
not an easy one, but we somehow
managed to sweat through another
week. This week’s pick: Hero
starring Dustin Hoffman, Geena
Davis, Chevy Chase, Andy Garcia,
and Joan Cusak.
Mary; So, Will, dazzle me. What
did you think?
Will: Well, other than the unreal-
istic plane crash scene, I thought it
was pretty good. :
M: Yes, actually, I was not expect-
ing toenjoy it, but Idid.’ To me, the

best thing about this movie was the
way it really challenges how you
look at truth and the way the media
can pervert it. Geena Davis has a
particularly good scene where she
examines her role as a journalist as
she accepts a major award. In her
acceptance speech, she comes to
the conclusion that her job is just
one endless dig for a bigger and
better story, withoutany regard for
the feelings of others.

W: Ironically, her best story is
right under her nose. Bernie
LaPlant, a cynical con-artist, res-
cues her and 53 others froma bum-

quistador. presents his view of the
incident as one of bravery (in an
exciting and well performed sword-
fight with the warrior), and vio-
lently aggressive promiscuity. He
concludes his presentation of the
“facts” with an indifferent retort to
the raped (but she enjoyed it) wife:
“In your whole life, it may be the
only thing you remember.”

The wife then tells her story as
she had presented it before court.
Davis had a difficult role which
required that she play the love-toy,
the assertive but self-pitying fe-
male, or the unfaithful wife (de-
pending on who was telling the
story.) Witheach story, itis hard to
believe she is the same wife — she
does a fine job of presenting her
overly manipulated and emotion-
ally diverse character. Her mother,

ing plane. This from a guy who
tells his son that life is layer upon
layer of bull, and whose motto is to
“look out for number one.”

M: I like Bernie LaPlant the char-
acter, but I was not as impressed
with Dustin Hoffman as Bernie
LaPlant. It seemed like sometimes
he lapsed back into “Rainman”
mode, with hisconstant mutterings
tohimself. It’s hard to know if that
was Dustin Hoffman’s fault, or the
fault of the script.

W: Geena, on the other hand,

MOVIE REVIEW:
Consenting Adults--

Should Get A Clue

By Scott McLean

Well, just as I was beginning

to think Id finally seen the end of
the “Basic Instinct” wanna-be

a flicks, another one has managed to

rear its ugly little head in theaters
around the country. Slickly pro-
moted as the next big picture to
feature a barrage of psychological
mind games (it even uses the “Ba-
sic Instinct” theme music in its
advertisements), Consenting
Adults fails to stimulate anything
but your gag mechanism. With a
Story line that caves in onitself and
no outstanding performances by
any of the cast members to save it,
this one is bound to be short-lived
at the box office for sure.

The initial premise presented
to us is not bad at all: an upscale
Atlanta couple (Kevin Kline and
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonie) are
lured into a nightmare by their
seemingly perfect new neighbors.
However, bad acting and a script
that delves into absurdity dooms
this pic. Eddie and Kay Otis are
the neighbors, aliving-on-the-edge
couple whose vitality rubs off on

Kline and Mastrantonio’s charac-
ters putting some “oomph” back
into their stale marriage. I don’t
know who the hell plays the parts
of Eddie and Kay, but I suspect
that the guy was probably a
stormtrooper in the Star Wars tril-
ogy and the girl did a stint in an
episode of Moenlighting. In any
case as the bond between these two
couples grows, Eddie suggests to
Kline’s character that perhaps they
should engage ina little wife-swap-
ping activity. Kline, who youcould
tell wanted to borrow a little more
than just a cup of sugar from his
neighbor, “consents” after some
arm twisting. Unfortunately, that
was Kline’s second mistake - his
first being the fact that he agreed to
do this movie.

I spent much of the movie
wondering why Kline and
Mastrantonio would stoop so low
as to be in a movie like this one -
actually I can believe Kline would
be in it, but it just goes to show you
what lengths folks will go to dur-

ALBUM REVIEW:
Harvest Moon: Neil

Young's Long-Awaited
Sequel to Harvest

By Rachel Newcomb

“Old Man, take a look at my -

life/24 and there’s somuch more,”
Neil Young sings on his 1972 clas-
sic album Harvest . Now, at age
46, Young has released Harvest
Moon, an album which echoes the
themes and musical motifs of Har-
vest. In the past twenty years,
Young has been a prolific artist,
producing albums whose styles
range from country-folk to rock.
During the 1980’s, Youngreleased
several experimental albums that
failed both commercially and criti-
cally, buthishighly acclaimed 1990
and ’91 albums Ragged Glory and
Freedom proved that Young had
not lost his edge. His most recent
release, Harvest Moon,showsNeil
Young in top form, still skillful at
writing and arranging music.
Harvest Moonisa break from
the clamorous live intensity of last
fall’s Weld, and is full of acoustic
folk-rock with emotional, expres-
sive lyrics. Neil Young has re-
cruited the same musicians who
appeared on Harvest, including his
band “Stray Gators” and such mu-
sical luminaries as James Taylor.
Musically ;Harvest Moon is strik-

ingly similar to 72’s Harvest, yet
Young has changed since then and
his growth as a person and as a
songwriter is reflected in his songs.
The album opens with “Unknown
Legend,” a folk-country ballad
which commends the anonymous
struggle of a working-class wait-
ress. “From Hank to Hendrix,” the
next track, pays homage to the
history of rock and the connection
Young feels with his own music.

The album is not without its
political moments. Gone are the
angry tirades against racism such
as Harvest’ s“ Alabama” or“‘South-
ern Man.” Instead, Young’s politi-
cal convictions reflect the current
era. Neil takes.a quiet yet firm
stance against the spoiling of na-
ture in “War of Man” and in the
impressive live cut “Natural
Beauty.” |

Harvest Moon isa fitting title
forthisalbum. Thesongsare much
more mature than those on Har-
vest, and reveal a Neil Young who
has experienced a great deal of life.
“I never tried to burn any bridges/
Though I know I let some good
