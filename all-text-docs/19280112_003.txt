Glee Club Wins Senna Place in State

Contest For College Clubs At Durham

On December 11, 1927, thirty-one men of
the Davidson Glee Club, including Professor
Cullum, the director, were transported by
means of a bus and an automobile, to Dur-
ham, where, the next evening, they repre-
sented Davidson in the annual State Glee
Club contest. The first honors of the con-
test were awarded to Duke University, they
having one more point than the Wildcat
singers.

The contest was sponsored by the Dur-
ham Chamber of Commerce, which paid the
entire expense of all clubs participating. All
the singers were entertained at the Washing-
ton Duke Hotel.

Prior to the contest, on the evening of
December 12th, all the participants were en-
tertained at a banquet, given in the Memorial
Hall at Duke University. At this time
speeches were delivered by representatives
of the various Durham civic organizations
who were active in helping to sponsor the
affair. The music for the occasion was ren-
dered by the Duke University Quartet.

An interesting feature of the occasion
was a mass meeting of all the clubs, directed
by Major Price, of State College.

The Glee Clubs entering the contest were
representatives of: Duke University, Guil-
ford College, State College, and Davidson.
The University Glee Club was barred by a
recent ruling of the National Association,
that a student must be prepared and Jéad the
club in person, during the contest. How-
ever, Carolina had representatives present.

The judges were: Mrs. Potter, of the
Raleigh Public Schools; Mr. Spookey, of
the High Point Public Séhools, and Dr.
Crosby Adams, of Montreat.

During the retirement of the judges, music
was rendered by the quarters of the various
contestants, The Davidson quartet was com-
posed of Proctor Thompson, J. S. Gray,
Johnny Foster and Bob Lowrance. .

The judges announced as their final de- |
cision, that Duke had obtained, by the score
of one point more htan Davidson, the right
to represent North Carolina in the Southern
District Contest of the National Association.

Two New Degrees

Offered By Duke

Durham, N. C., Jan. 7 (CP)—The an-
nouncement was made here today by Dean
W. H. Wannamaker, of the complete re-
vision of the courses in civil engineering
and the offering of two new degrees, Bach-
elor of Science in civil engineering and
Bachelor of Science in electrical, engineering
those completing these revised courses.

While the revised courses are effective for
the class of 1932, the present Freshman and
Sophomore classes in engineering may be-
come eligible for new degrees under certain
conditions.

The minimum requirement for either of
the new degrees is one hundred and thirty-
eight semester hours of work,:most of which
is prescribed. About forty semester hours
are devoted to the major engineering group.
The need of engineers to have knowledge of
‘economics and business law is recognized by
requiring six semester hours of work in the
department of economics and political
science,

For the past year the engineering depart-
ment has been actively interested in revising
the curricula so that the engineering courses
offered at Duke might represent the best
ideas in engineering education. Over 138
engineering colleges have been studied in
this process of change.

in the work of the Master. If these men will
only drop by and talk it over with the secre-
tary or with any of the cabinet, it is felt
that some work may be given ‘them, and in
that way they will soon have an active part
in the “Y’s” work. Don’t put it off, if you are
one of these fellows, but have it arranged
now.
ee | SS
The series of Vocational Guidance meet-

| ings will start about the 1th of February,
| under the direction of Julian Lake. There
| will be many new ideas to be gained from
| these meetings, and in every way they prom-
| ise to be a fine opportunity which should be
|of great help to many men.

The leader of the Spring Evangelistic

services has been decided upon in the choice |

of Rev. Sam Glasgow, of the First Presby-
terian Church of Knoxville, Tenn. If it is
possible to secure the services of this well-

|

known preacher ,the meetings will be ar- |

{ranged for the early or middle part of
March. More definite news will be given
later.

total of twenty scholarships. These aids are
to be distributed under the charge of Edgar
Tufts to boys who are able to do the work
in the school and who can make good use of
the training. The amount needed for one
student a year is one hundred and fifty dol-
lars. If fifty dollars*of this amount can be
obtained, the boy can work at the school and
earn the rest or its equivalent and thus attend
the institution. ‘Phus the Davidson sub-
scriptions will enable some twenty boys to
attend the Banner Elk School for one year.

The student body of the school is made up
of mountain béys. Being located in the most
wild and out-of-the-way place among that
section of the Carolina mountains, there is
very little opportunity for the children to
obtain the advantages of even an elementary
education, much less a chance for the privi-
leges of higher training. Therefore, the
giving of aid of the value mentioned above
to twenty boys by means of some persona
sacrifice is indeed a worthwhile deed.

oMr. Tufts, by means of personal letters
to the Y. M. C. A.tand bulletins to Jim Ap-
pleby and Hugh Arrowood, is endeavoring to
keep Davidson in complete knowledge of the
progress of the mountain work, and anyone
interested in a more complete and detailed
account of the events at the school can get
the information from the above mentioned
sources.
