Cats swim to two victories

“We are a better team than
we were last year,’’ claims
Davidson Swim Team Coach
Pat Miller.

Considering last season's
record of 11-4, some might
have cause to doubt her, but
Miller has several reasons for
optimism concerning the pros-
pects.

Returning swimmers are
Mark Tommerdahl, who is the
current holder of the Southern
Conference record in the 200
fly as well as being the owner
of six school records, Jonat-
han Washburn, who placed in
the top four in three events in

the conference championships

last year as well as being the

possessor of nine school rec-
ords, and Marshall Brown,
who placed fifth in the 200 fly
in the championships last win-
ter.

among the returnees, Miller
has had the squad working as
hard as ever. Most of the
swimmers have been working
out on their own since the be-
ginning of school, but team

practices consisting of two
hour-a-day sessions did not
begin until November 1.

To keep in top form during ™

Christmas* the squad will
work out in Florida, swim-
ming 15,000 yards a day.

The team will compete in
fifteen dual meets this year as
well as the conference champ-
ionships in February. ©

Very few of the meets will be
em in Johnston Gym, how-

er, because of the inadequa-

cies ‘of the Davidson swim-
ming facility. The college pool
only has four lanes whéreas
most schools have at least six,
plus it does not have any
diving equipment. Therefore,
any school that swims against
Davidson in a meéet here,
automatically receives sixteen
points before the match
even begins. As Mier noted,
‘*We just can’t give sixteen
points to good teams like The
Citadel and Furman."

With East Carolina no lon-
ger a member of the Southern
COnference, Mer sees a much
tighter race for the champion-
ship. ‘‘A few points could
separate first and fifth place,”’

she observed, but added that
the Wildcats have an excellent
chance to improve upon their
sixth place finish of last
swimming meet. .

The swimteam captured a
victory at home and on the
road last week, defeating Pf-
eiffer College 69-43 in Tues-
day's meet at Davidson, fol-
lowed by a 66-46 win over
UNC-W Saturday.

Women cagers top Catawba
in pressure-packed contest

The women’s basketball
team finally got on the win-
ning track yesterday by def-
eating a tough Catawba team
oo: The girls are now 1 and

Catawba jumped out to a
quick lead, but were never

points as a result of consistent
play.

The Wildcats tied the game
at 61-61 with only three min-
utes remaining, owing to the
clutch free throw shooting of
Sarah Womack, who was 7 for
7 from the charity stripe for
the night. ‘

Also aiding the comeback
was Cindy Mrison who domin-
ated the boards late in the
game, and the fact that four
players scored in double fig-
ures. Co-Captain Sally Bon-
durant was also credited with
an excellent’ game, sinking
several from the top of the
circle.

Co-Captian Beth Tanner
stated the key to victory was
the fine ball-handling, resul-
ting in fewer turnovers.

Last Thursday, the girls
lost a heartbreaker to UNCC
in Johnston Gym 58-57. The
cagers had the game pulled

from their grasp when they
49ers managed a bucket with
only ten seconds remaining in
the game.

The game was highlighted
by a comeback which saw the
girls erase a 16-point deficit.
Instrumental in the comeback
was Tanner, who scored a
career-high 26 points. Sarah
Womak helped with 15 points.

The girls lost their first
game to Converse 55-51. The
first half was completely dom-
inated by Converse, but the
girls managed to pull together
in the second half, despite
having only practiced three
days following Thanksgiving
break. High scorés for the
Cats were made by Tanner and
Womack with 13 points a
piece.

The next game for the
women will be home against
Campbell at 7:00 in Johnston
Gym.

Wrestlers grapple

with tough season

The wrestling team lost its
opening match with Catawba
College on December 6. The
team was substantially weak-
ened by sickness, and Coach
Charles Parker was forced to
use newcomers at several pos-
itions.

The key match was the
177lb. bout, Scott Phillips
took a 6-0 lead into the third
period and was pinned.

Catawba went on to win
30-21.

Freshman Pat AMKinsey en-
joyed an auspicious debut,
pinning his man after thor-
oughly dominating the 134lb.
match. Anthony Dantilipo, at

- 167, also pinned his opponent,
“ while Heavyweight Rob King

won a 6-0 decision.

Pete Johnson, Kevin Cald-
Rich Riech all lost close decis-
ion. :

On the 10th, the team
wrestled in the Catawba Tour-
nament, in which six area
schools participated. Two men
were entered in each weight
class, and several Wildcats
were awarded individual hon-
ors: MKinsey, Phillips, and
King took 2nd’s, Reich won a
3rd, and Johnson and Senior
captain Glen Ballard won4th
places. Everyone entered won
at least one match.

The team’s prospects look
very bright, for there is exper-
ienced leadership, depth, and
an influx of talented freshmen
on the squad.

Captain Ballard exudes a
quiet confidence, ‘‘I don’t
think we'll lose too many
matches after Christmas.”

The Wildcats’ first home °
match is set for Jan. 14th,
when they face Elon,
