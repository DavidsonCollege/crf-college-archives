A glance at the season statistics show the potency of

the Wildcat passing attack. With seven men doing the
passing, they have completed twenty passes for a total
of 270 yards against only two interceptions. This-is-an—
average of 13.5 yards per completed pass, or five yards
per pass play. Net yards rushing for the team is 283
yards on 88 plays, an average of slightly over three
yard per play.

In the vards-gained-rushing column, Erwin leads with a total

of 84 yards, followed up by Sifferd with 53. Best average is Cart

Pahl’s wtih a five-vard. per try average in his one game, with
Elon. Buek Williams is runner-up with a 4.5 vard average
Erwin, Sifford and Anderton all have a three-vard average

Doug Rice has uncorked one complete pass out of
three but it gives him a 26-yard-per-pass average.
Jimmy Sifford has the best percentage of passes com-
pleted with an average of 5.8 yards per. Burt Ander-
ton’s good ones go for an average of 18 yards each.

Before those of you who ever get as deep into the DAVID-

last week’s column. Due to certain unavoidable diffieulties—

At Davidson, easy wins sometimes seem to be as hard
to get as games with State or William and Mary. From
here, Wofford looks like an easy win, in spite of the
fact that they drubbed Hampden-Sydney and lost to

; Catawba only on bad breaks. Two fumbles inside their

! own ten cost them the tune of a 14-0 Catawba decision.
Don't forget, too, that Wofford is still smarting under
the 54-0 licking the ’Cats handed them last season.
They'll be out for revenge.

Is it necessary to remind the studefht body that it is not in
the Davidson tradition to cheer when an opponent on the ath-
letie field is penalized? We are just proud enough to think that
we don’t need penalties to win our ball games. We don’t like
the idea of capitalizing on the other fellow’s ‘‘mistortune.’’? A
Davidson man considers that it is the official’s job to regulate
the game and that he is best qualified for the job. He is neither
bully enough to cheer the opponent's penalty, or to protest
his own.

INTRODUCING
JIMMY SIFFORD

By CHERRY STRIBLING
One of the most improved mem-
bers of this year’s edition of the
Wildcat team is speedy wingback
Jim. Sifford. In the three games
played so far Sifford has ‘shone out
in the Davidson backfield like a
beacon light.

Jim hails from Albemarle, North
Carolina avhere he played football
and basketball, being elected cap-
tain of the football team in
third year of competition. Twenty
years old, Sifford is a veteran of

18 months service in the Navy. A
quiet spoken, well-liked student,
Jim is a member of Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity.
