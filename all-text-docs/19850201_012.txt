Wildcat Sniglets: A Davidson Lexicon

Not long ago a book entitled Sniglets appeared,
claiming to solve a real problem in American
vocabulary. A sniglet is a word for something that
needed a name but previously did not have one. Their
classic example: what is the crusty stuff at the top of a
ketchup bottle? Flen, they answered. A necessary

service this was, but the sniglet makers overlooked fair
Davidson.

ANN MEADOR
