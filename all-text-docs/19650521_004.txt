PRAM Ambassadors
Ready For Latin Jaunt

“We: Inave almmast all the mon-
ey: the students have completed
their six weeks of training class-
es and are ready to go. I think
they will ably represent the real
United States to the Latin Amer-
icans,” said Fred Ehlers, Rich-
ardson scholar from Ecuador
and originator of te Project of
the Americas (PRA&M).

PRAM will send eight stu-
dents to Ecuador this summer
in initiation af am exehange pro-
gram between the United States
and Ecuador: The students will
leave Miami on June 12 and re-
turn around August [2 via Ecva-
toriana de Aviacior.

Money for the project has
been raised by students through
the YMCA BDaster Gift Fund, a
special fund of the IPC, the Sen-
ior Class Gift, and other stu-
dent projects plus funds match-
ed by grants from the Richard-
son and Martim Cannon Founda-
tions.

Ehlers, surveying last minute
preparations for the trip, said,

John L. Burns, Robert L. Comp-
ton, Bruce A. Dalton, Jr., Pat-
rick S. Fisher, Dale F. Keller,

“Tl am very grateful to all the
students for their support of
PRAM and this cultural ex-
change program and want them
to know that titis could not have
been possible without the tre-
mendous aid; both in money and
time, that they have given.”

The students will live in pri-
vate homes iir Beuvador and at
the University of Quito during
their stay and’ will travel ail
over the country giving lectures
and discussing topics of interest
to the Ecuadbrians. Their view-
points will be nompartisan, as
there is disagreement among
members ‘of the group on these
basic issues. They will carry a
large selection of slides depict-
ing all phases of life in Amer-
ica from the very high to the
very low economie levels, and
descriptivé material about the
United States, its government
and industry.

In addition to commenting on
the summer exchange program,
PRAM will devote much time to
starting chapters in other col-
leges and universities in the
United States.

“It is my hope that PRAM
will expand to many other
states and become a_ national
organization,"’ said Ehlers, but,
“Davidson College will remain
the center of this organization.”

Private sources have chal-
lenged the trustees of Da-
vidson College to raise $50,-
000 in a matching fund for
a $100,000 improvement of
Richardson Stadium.

Davidson Colfege Director of
Publicity Taylor Blackwell stat-
ed, “There has been announced
to this office a challenge grant
to improve the field pending.
It has been pending for a couple
of months.”

“There are certain details
and public relations that have to
be ironed out if this gift is from
an outside benefactor that would
have to be worked gut with that
benefactor.”

President D. G. Martin was
out of town and unavaliable for
comment on the gift.

Athletic officials have greeted
word of the windfall with joy
but some lack of certainty about
just what is to be done..

“Im just very pleased that
the money has been givem™ said
foottall coach Homer Smith. He
indicated that the footiull staff
was: interested in improving the
appearance of the field:

“Pm sure the director of pub-
licitw would like to have some
impnovements in the pressbox.
The football field itself is in
fine: shape. We have a good
locker room. The only thing we
as coaches are concerned about
is ttte appearance of tie field.
I \orow that it will be a much
prattier field.”

Athletic Director Tom Scott
apologized for his Jack: of knowl-
edge about the details of the
gift, saying. “I don’t know.
You'd have to ask Dr. Martin
about that. He seems to be
able to get the money he needs.”

“Dr. Martin mentioned some-
thing about getting 950.080 on a
matching grant, but Fve got to
talk to him to find cut what it's
to be used for.”

Outgoing chairman of the Ath-
letic Council andi trustee repre-
sentative to that committee, Dr.

Tom Sparrow, commented on,

the gift, “I think some arrange-
ments were made, but I don't
exactly know what. I don’t re-
member all of those details.
“The council has recommend.
ed for a number of years the

-_~

financing of some improvements
in the lighting, dressing rooms,
and adding some more show-
ers.”

Dr. Scott noted that the coun-
cil has had several proposals be-
fore it for several years. “I
guess Dr. Martin is just going
back and getting some of our
requests from four years ago.”

He explained that the fall
meeting of the Athletic Council
four years ago had focused at-
tention on atlding lights to the
stadium as well as making sev-
eral other improvements.

**We played:-Furman one after-
noon early in September when
the temperature was 94 de-
grees.”’

$100,000 IMPROVEMENTS

‘Stadium Repair Pending

“It’s a wonder to me that sev-
eral of the players didn’t die,
but fortunately just a few got
sick from the heat.”

He said that they recommend-
ed then the installation of ade-
quate lights so that these early
games could be played at night
when the heat would not be so
severe,

He estimated the cost of light-
ing the fleld at $25,000.

Dr. Scott also pointed out,
“We could have a pretty little
field out there. We need to add
some red and white. It’s just
gray concrete now.”

He said that improvements to
the press box are needed be-
cause WBT radio is planning to
carry the Davidson football
games next year and because a
number of the teams that Da-
vidson plays have radio net-
works that carry their games.

Being an Army officer is a challenge. Officers must be
leaders . . . able to take responsibility . . . get impor-
tant jobs done.

It isn’t easy to win a commission as an Army
officer. But if you are taking the Basic Course in
ROTC you're well on your way—provided you can
measure up to the high standards required for admis-
sion to the Advanced Course.

As a student in one of the 247 colleges and univer-
sities offering senior ROTC training, you are in a
privileged group. There’s no better way for any
college man to get the training and skills needed to
be an Army officer than through the on-campus pro-
gram created specifically for that p ROTC.

Here you learn to be a leader... to develop the

If you're good enough to be an Army officer, don’t settle for less.

qualities that add a vital plus to your academic
training . . . qualities that will pay off for the rest of
your life in whatever career you choose to follow.
There are other advantages too. Pay, at the rate
of $40 per month during the Advanced Course plus
allowances for summer training and travel. Fellow-
ship and social activity. The chance to work with
modern Army equipment, and perhaps to qualify for
Army flight training if it is offered at your school. And
then gold bars and a commission as an Army officer.
Why not talk to your Professor of Military Science
now. Let him know you're interested in signing up
for the Advanced Course. Then if you are offered an
opportunity to join, don’t pass it up. It’s the program
that’s best for you...and best for your country.
