for Debate With |
University Frosh’

The Davidson Freshmen debates this spring
will be held first with Carolina. There is a
possibility of the Duke University debating
team coming in and forming a triangle. How-
ever, in either case, Davidson will have two
teams, one affirmative and one negative, with
two men on each team.
debate here at Davidson.

The preliminary debates, in which the sub-
ject for discussion will be, ‘Resolved, That
Congress Should Enact a Uniform System
of Marriage and Divorce Laws,” will be held
on March 13th. The Freshmen intercollegi- |
ate debaters will choose their subject at a
later date. The Freshmen debates will take |
place about May Ist.

Some good debating is promised by the
Freshmen team, and an interesting discussion
is expected for and against the subject for
the preliminary debates. Regular practices
have been held by the Freshmen team and
each member is preparing himself well for
the coming preliminaries in March.

Spanish Club Holds
Initiation for Eight

The Spanish Club of Davidson College
held its initiation on Tuesday night, Feb-
ruary 14th, in Shearer Hall. Eight men
were taken into the society at this time.
These men were: S. L. Gant, J. T. Mat-
thews, Louis Hart, B. F. Brown, A. G. Ran- |
dolph, Archie Carr, Jack Pepper, and D. F, |
Cannon. The initiation proper was followed |
by a “feéd” and general get-together period. |

The members of this club are first recom- |
mended by the professor and then must be |
passed upon by a committee of students ap- |
pointed by the president of the club. Elec- |
tion to the society is based upon proficiency |
in the Spanish language, attained by real |
effort and interest in the class. The present |
officers’ of the club are: President, John
McKnight; vice-president, Ralph Glenn; sec-

the God of love, for He sent to us Jesus
Christ to impart this love to man. God's
love gives us what He possesses; it is a self-
imparting love. God made Himself known
by partial revelations to various men until
“in the fullness of time” He made a full
disclosure of Himself in Jesus Christ.

We must think of Christ as our Saviour
rather than as our Redeemer, because a man
who has no sense of sin will not feel indebted
to Christ merely as a Redeemer. Some men
think that their sins are an inheritance, a
thing that has been handed down to them
from their forefathers, and that it is im-
possible to escape from them, Jesus did not
look on sin as an inheritance. No man in
the world is able to save himself from sin.
He fights a losing fight every time, because
evil is stronger than the will of the strongest
man. Sin is the power of the devil that
operates in the spiritual world, and the only
way to overcome sin and the only power
sufficient to counteract it is the
Christ revealedvas Saviour,

State and National Offices

\

The seventeenth annual conference of thie |
North Carolina Student Volunteer Union |
met at Duke University on the 17th, 18th |
and 19th of Februarye © Colleges throughout |
the state were represented ; many of the dele-
hates. being natives of foreign countries, so
that the conference had somewhat of an in-
ternational aspect, this being especially so in |
the talks that were made by native-born
Chinese, Korean, Japanese and African stu-

Davidson College was represented by ,
13 members of the local Volunteer Band. |
Among the representatives of Davidson was |
Glenn Gry, who, for the past year, has heen |
president of the North Carolina Union. Up- |
on the expiration of his term of office at|

| the recent conference, Glenn was chosen as |

council member of the National Union from|
this state in recognition of his service’ as
president of the State Union. Another of
Davidson’s representatives who has played a
large part in the affairs of the North Caro-
lina Union was J. M. Andrew, who has just
given up the editorship of the “Volunteer,”
the organ of the State Union, and which,
under the retiring editor’s hands, has become
the leading publication of its kind in’ the
country. Davidson was also honored by hav-
ing John Bradley placed on the committee
of missionary education.

The theme of the conference was ‘the
Challenge World College
Youth Today,” and the whole program bore
out this theme.

As was previously mention-

dents in regard to missionary work in their
countries and following them were discussion
groups. The closing address was made by
| Dr. Edmund D. Soper, dean of the School

of Religious Education at Duke University,
in which he spoke on the unique and distinc-
tive elements of Christianity. The confer-
ence was fortunate to have four speakers on
the program who spoke at the International.
Convention which met in Detroit last De-
cember.

Entertainment was provided bountifully
by Duke University for the delegates and
who went from Davidson wish to ex-
press their appreciation for the many kind-

entertainment was a Korean play that was
presented with a Korean taking the leading
role. It might be said here, too, that one of
the sights of the conference was Johnny
Preston, of Davidson, who was born in Ko-
rea, and his two Korean friends with whom
he attended a Korean dinner in Durham,

Those who went from Davidson to the
conference were Glenn Fry, J. M. Andrew,
W. K.. Forbes, R. T. Morrison, Shelby
Vance, John Pope, Robert Turner, John
Preston, Brice Miller, G. F. Houck, Jack
Matthews, and Ben M. Drake.

N.C.C.W. Proctor System
Changed by Girls’ Vote

At a recent mass meeting of the students
of N. C. C. W., it was decided to try a new
proctor system in the dormitories.

By the old system, two proctors were elect-
ed for every hall at the beginning of each
semester, working with a house commitee
composed. of the house president, vice-house-
president, and all the proctors,

The new plan which has been suggested
and is to be used is to have every girl except
members ‘of the senate serve as proctors for
a length of time which will be determined by
each house president, according to the num-
ber of girls in her dormitory. Under this
system, the house committee will be composed
of house president, house vice-president, and
three proctors.

This proctor system will go into effect as

soon as schedules can be made out and posted.
