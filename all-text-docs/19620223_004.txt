SINKING TWO straight 15-

eye of Lefty Driesell at basket-

good player never loses the

you up if you have time. We
need some beef out there.”

Rusk’s presence until the re-

the game in his day, when a
center jump was still required
after each shot. Rusk particular-
ly recalled a 17-12 victory over
Carolina.

Before leaving, he gave in to
requests for one more basket,

Earlier during his formal

generous credit to former Dav-

road to a career in internation-

Approximately 40 of the 48 scholarship finalists for

1962 will begin

arriving on campus

the nights of Feb. 28

and March 1 for a two-day visit.

H. Edmunds White, associate
director of admissions, noted
that the college has a dual pur-
pose in inviting the finalists to
visit the school. “This weekend
will give the finalists a chance
to see Davidson and at the same
time the scholarship committee
will have a chance to interview
these boys and make some
evaluations of them.”

The second group, composed
mostly of students from outside
the Carolinas-Virginia area, will
arrive Thursday night and will
follow a schedule identical with
that of the first group.

Thursday. and Friday after-
noons, the college will sponsor
coffee hours which are specifi-
cally designed to allow the
faculty to meet the finalists.
White, emphasizing the import-
ance of these coffee hours, com-

mented, “We are most anxious | '

for the faculty members to at-

to meet these boys, and in order
to allow the boys themselves a

chance to get to know the facul-| ;

COMMITTEE INTERVIEW

Each finalist will also have
an interview with the scholar-
ship committee to permit the
committee to acquaint
with each boy personally. White
said it is expected that ali, or
almost all, of the finalists will
receive scholarships of some
kind, the amount of the stipend
depending on the student's need
for financial assistance.

Of the 48 finalists ‘invited to
visit the campus next week, 13,
or roughly 25%, are from North
Carolina. Six other southern
states are represented by 25
finalists, while 10 of the boys
are from northern states.

World News Emanates
From Campus Facilities

BY DAVE PUSEY
Davidsonien Feature Writer
The days were slipping by towards the much-publicized and long-awaited visit
of Dean Rusk. In the public relations office, Taylor Blackwell and his assistants
were checking and rechecking the numerous details which together would make this
visit congenial to Secretary Rusk, the college, and the visiting news media represen-
ves.

Blackwell remarked, “An im-

papers and so forth since De-
cember on developments of this
visit. We've also worked very
closely with Bob McCloskey,
Rusk’s press secretary, arrang-

tails we weren't too sure about.
After all, a thing like this has
no precedent here at David-
son.”

the telephone room, from
which stories were phoned

201 was headquarters for the
secretaries and stenograph-

Rusk’s on-the-record talks
during the day. Finally, Room
203 became the Printer’s Ink
Inn, with typewriters and
other writing materials, plus
coffee and sendwiches, for the
laboring press.

The public relations men
were obviously going to do
everything possible to create
what a newsman hopes for in
an assignment of this nature:
a red carpet and a free hand.

the radio and TV reporters ar-
