DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

Have a fulfilling fall break!

Professor caught posing as
student on freshman

This summer, faced with the daunt-
ing task of their approaching first year
of college, Davidson College freshmen

LiveJournal website. In their commu-
nity, the incoming first year students
could discuss their feelings about the
upcoming year, and ask for advice on
Davidson topics.

As with any anonymous forum there
is always the possibility of misrepre-
sentation, and this opportunity was
used'by Professor R.J. Blanton to help
incoming freshmen confronted with
the prospect of leaving home for the
first time. Blanton, a James F. Winston
Professor of Psychology for the last
seven years at Davidson, had. been
posting entries on the Davidson
LiveJournal Community. However,
rather than exposing his true identity,
Blanton posted pretending to be a sopho-
more French major named Pierre. He
used the pseudonym of “blantster1285”
to begin a dialogue with Elizabeth, Majors
08, whose nickname was
“thirdbelk4life.” Dr. Blanton first en-
gaged Elizabeth with a response to her
question about the renovations to the
Belk dormitory. After this initial post,
they had several more conversations.
The subjects of these conversations
ranged from the quality of Commons
food to suggestions of which classes to
take. “He told me I should sign up for
Psych 101 with Dr. Blanton,” reported
Elizabeth. “At the time I really thought
he was a sophomore French major
named Pierre, but now that I know he
was trying to get me to sign up for his

class. I’m a little sketched out.”

“Blanster1285” also replied to several
other posts, informing students of how
the self-scheduled final exam process
went, explaining the ins-and-outs of
flickerball, and telling people to join the
psychology club for which he obviously
did not disclose that he served as the fac-
ulty advisor.

Blanton’s posts consisted of a mix of
advice for incoming freshmen and refer-
ences to popular culture, all under the
guise of a rising sophomore student. “Hey
yall! A/S/L check! My name is Pierre,
and I’m from Atlanta. Any other A-town
folk out there? ATL baby! Let me tell ua
bit about Davidson. First there’s the
Freshmen Olympics, which this year is
called Baker Nite, but that’s really just an
excuse to give you a swim test! Make sure

u get a futon to have people over on,
and don’t get the mini-fridge! Its a
rip! Who’s living on 3™ Belk? ‘That
was my hall last year, and we owned
every1 in flickerball! BTW, def come
hang out at Akers after schools starts!
Anyone see Old School? ‘Ring the bell
Blue!”

According to Blanton, no students
suspected that he was not who he
claimed to be. “All I really needed to
do was know some Dave Matthews
lyrics and talk about ‘Napoleon Dy-
namite.’ I planned to complain about
all my work and say I wish I had
joined a frat, but it turned out I didn’t
need that much conversation mate-
rial,” Blanton explained. “People
from the community completely
bought my pseudonym, even those
students who are members of the
class of ’07 and knew there was no Pierre
in their class.”

It was not until after the first week of
school that anyone discovered his true
identity. The deception came to light af-
ter a curious sophomore logged Blanton’s
I.P. address after discovering that there
was no Pierre in SAE, the fraternity that
he claimed to belong to, and then posting
blantster1285’s true identity on the web
log. By that point, no one was using the
LiveJournal community anymore, so Dr.
Blanton avoided any kind of public blog
humiliation.

Still, Blanton claimed to be extremely
embarrassed by his public unmasking. “I
can’t even look at the freshmen in my
Psych 101 class with a straight face any-
more. I just feel like such a sketchball.”

Inquest launched into Laundry Service misdeeds

Operations at the Lula Bell Houston
Laundry have been suspended indefi-
nitely in order for investigators to launch
an inquest into alleged illegal actions on
the part of some employees. Initial re-
ports state that members of the laundry
team have been selling students’ cloth-
ing on eBay for at least five years. Ac-
cording to sources, almost every item of
clothing “lost” by students or left too
long in the Dormitory laundry rooms
over the past five years has been specifi-
cally taken from the laundry for the pur-
pose of resale.

Davidson has long been renowned for
its laundry service, which is included in
each student’s tuition. During the
College’s budget discussion this past fall,
the subject of the laundry service’s bud-
get came up. Over the past four years,
the laundry’s budget has remained con-
stant, while every other department has

increased expen-
ditures by an av-
erage of thirteen
percent. While -
content about not
having to cut into
the athletic bud-
get for laundry
related costs,
many on the
board were curi-
ous about how
the laundry could
remain solvent,
given the high
rate of laundry
turnover and the
costs of employ-
ment, supplies,
power, equip-
ment, and facility
maintenance.

After manager June Anderson failed to
respond to Head of Business services Jo-
seph Hamilton’s many meeting requests,
he decided to see her in person in order to
discuss the laundry’s finances.

“] just wanted to get some information
on the basic costs of running the laundry
facility,” explained Hamilton. “Finally I _
went there as it was closing on a Satur-
day.” Hamilton claimed that he walked in
on Anderson handing out one hundred
dollar bills to each of the employees. He
also asserted that he witnessed each of
the staff members muttering something
that sounded like an oath of silence to
Anderson after they received their
money.

Hamilton said that he waited until the

this door

Police were seen carrying bundles of socks through :

Anderson with questions about the fiscal
management of the laundry service. Ac-
cording to Hamilton, “She was uncoop-
erative, giving far too many vague facts
and descriptions of policies that should be
very specific.” As he turned to leave, he
happened to notice a pair of socks labeled
with his laundry number sticking out of a
partly open closet. He proceeded to point
them out and asked Anderson why they
had been separated. “She told me to keep
out of there and made some kind of threat
about my dark colored clothes,” Hamilton
claimed, “then she shoved the socks in my
hand and hurried me out the door.”
Hamilton has since stated that the closét
was full of socks and undershirts, some
with numbers, some without.

Hamilton eventually unearthed a led-

ger of expenditures and profits that
stated that the laundry service should
have been unable to pay its own ex-
penses throughout the last five years. He
went to student services bookkeeper
Wanda Mae Harper about the inconsis-
tencies between this ledger and the an-~
nual fiscal statements by the laundry
service. Harper, after listening to him
describe in detail how there seemed to
be a large influx of money covering the
service up to and beyond the break-even
point, confessed that she had forged the
annual reports to hide the illegal sale of
socks, undershirts, and even shirts and
pants for five years. ,
Harper stated, “I thought it was just a
temporary way to give the laundry room
a boost back to breaking even. [Ander-
son] promised me it would never
progress beyond socks...I had no idea it
would go this far with us taking Lacoste
shirts and Diesel Jeans.” The conspiracy
apparently extends through many on the
staff. Any participant showing hesitation
or uncertainty has suffered an unfortu-
nate “laundry accident.”
Harper gave details, prior to being
taken into safe custody, of the workers
having slowly amassed an average of 1400
socks and 250 undershirts over the course
of a year. Recognizable articles of clothing
were taken more cautiously, but with in-
creasing frequency through the years.
Recently, khaki shorts and Polo shirts be-
came the laundry’s two biggest sellers.
Harper is confident in her safety as a
key witness for the case against Anderson,
hyit still has insisted upon having a cam-
pus security officer assigned to his house

The Davidsonian

New hire

spices up the

Union Café

Some may have noticed the changes
in the Union Café recently in response
to flagging revenue. Most visible, is the
addition of a new manager and a new
chef staff. As part of his three-pronged
strategy to improve the Café, the new
manager, Ross Younger, has already
added daily pasta specials, a more
diverse fruit selection, and a new line
of themed hamburgers. The final
prong in the strategy, however, was
just implemented last week when
Dining Services hired Frank McDonald
to serve as the Café’s new teppanyaki

chef. .

The new hibachi is located in place
of the old Oven section after it was
closed down due to its lackluster sales.
According to McDonald, “We were
seeking something to separate us from.
the competition. Everyone’s bored of
the same old Wildcat Burgers, Chicken
Baby Blue, and Bistro Beef Sandwiches.
Plus, I gave my crew failing marks on
presentation, and I think that Frank
should help us improve immensely in
that realm.”

Already after one week, the new
teppanyaki chef seems to be a huge
success. Most visibly, at six o’clock, the
Union Café is already packed to watch
McDonald perform his most popular
stunt, in which he pours a large
quantity of oil onto the grill and sets it
ablaze into a remarkable fireball. It
also serves to disinfect the surface of
the hibachi.

While waiting for an order of hibachi
steak, Josh Stevens ’06 commented,
“The chef's flamboyant personality and
flashy grilling style makes the time you
spend waiting for the food fly by.” For
example, when Josh ordered the
vegetable side, “the chef took the
onions, stacked them up, and made the
flaming volcano thing out of it.”

Situational humor is also a forte of
the new chef. According to students,
McDonald adds an interactive element
to ordering food. Diane Russell ’08
reported, “I ordered the shrimp and
steak combination plate. While he was
preparing the shrimp, he stuck his
knife in the tail, wiggled it around, and
said ‘Flipper.’ I burst.out in laughter,
but that was precisely what he wanted,

’ because as soon as my mouth opened,

he tossed a shrimp tail‘in it using his
spatula.”

Mary Clark ’06 also finds that
McDonald improves her Union Café
experience. “Even though it takes
longer to get my food, it seems shorter
because I’m always laughing and
having a good time, He does this trick
where he takes an egg, rolls it on his
spatula, and pronounces it an ‘egg roll.’
I find that jokes like these make my
dining experience much more fulfilling.

Plus, the reasonable prices for

traditional Japanese steakhouse fare
don’t hurt.”

McDonald came to Davidson with a
lot of experience in the art of Teppan
cooking. He got his start in 1994 as an
apprentice at the Benihana restaurant
in Alpharetta, Georgia. After his
apprenticeship ended, he was hired by
Kobe Japanese Steakhouse in
Mooresville, North Carolina as an
associate chef. For his outstanding
work, he was promoted to chef in 2001,
and served in that capacity at Kobe
until early last week.
