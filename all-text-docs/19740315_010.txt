Folklore has it that egg
salad was discovered by North
Carolina Civil War Governor
Zeb Vance who was searching
at the time tor answer to the
fried fisn-pit cooked barbeque
pardox which threatened the
health of all Tar Heel citizens.

In twenty-three years. come
November. the art of egg
salad making has reached its
zenith in the M & M Soda
Shop. where Potts delicately
mixes fifteen dozen egg and
three gallons of mayonaisse to
produce this gourmet delight.

Co-conspirator Murray
Fleming ‘hence the M &
M designation’ ts an inventor
in his own right. For he was
the first to make a large
orange. squeezing an orange
instead of a lemon mistakenly
in a moment of culinary
passion

They have seen their
establishment serve as the
largest off-campus fraternity
house, as the home of Satur-
day night supper supreme.
and as meeting place for town
and gown. for egghead and
redneck alike.

Tomorrow for lunch partake
of the legendary egg salad and
large orange. Ask what Lefty
Driesell was really like. What-
basketball team was David-
sons best or what your
favorite professor was like as
a student. You may be
suprised

Viva la egg salad plate

alumnus recollections

Every alumni weekend a
crowd gathers for lunch at the
M & M. and for a look a:
perhaps the only thing that is
like it always was. You won-
der if the people in there wil!
remember your name
whether vou have changed
more than they have. and i:
the food is good anymore.
There were times afterchapel

when everyone would go down
at seven o'clock . and there
would be a hundred big
oranges lined up on the coun-
ter and a hundred more ready
to go

It seems like there used to
be a row of fraternity pictures
above the booths, and that’s
how you learned everyone's
name.

Maybe students today don't
learn all the names that go
with all the faces. With the
streaking, they probably don’t
notice faces anymore.

They used to give away the
pie and coffee left at the end of
the day. and if you played your
cards right. every once in a
while you could be just
finishing a ham and cheese
when they got ready to lock
the door.

With things so different now,
(there's no mandatory
chapel), they close early and
don't fix Saturday supper.

The orange juice has a little
too much sugar, and canned
soups always give you gas.
The seats still groan though,
and that may be the same
cash register. If it isn’t exac-
tly the same, it's damn close.

police report

About every time I go in
there. Tom Sadler's back in
that far booth drinking coffee.
propped forward on his elbows
and looking calmly out the
window. hoping that if
something's got to happen. it
will happen right in front of
this store

Just sit down here and make
like you're reading for a while.
and you can hear all about the
town government. and about
which business transactions
would be best to look into.

If this place wasn't here.
nobody would ever find the
mayor.

These students though talk a

different language. All I ever
hear them say about the place
is that it’s strange. I don’t
guess there is any other place
like it. I don’t see why that
makes it stranger than any
place else.

If I had my way, they'd ser-
ve a good hamburger, which
would make things just per-
fect and maybe not as strange
to the students.

People from the college get
on my nerves because they all
act alike. They don’t speak to
anyone they don’t know: they
look just a little bit too clean,
and sometimes they come
close to having that Davidson
smell all over them.

Six o'clock is about the right
time for avoiding all this

mess. But nothing much they
serve sits well in your
stomach that early in the mor-
ning. I guess you can’t win in
everything.
From the Orange makers

We've seen a lot of faces go
by in the last 20 odd years.
Every once in a while a fellow
comes in and has that look on
his face that means he’s

hoping somebody will speak to
him.

It’s so hard to remember all
the names, though. We've
worked it out so we speak and
ask how he’s doing and get
around to finding out what his
job and family are like without
saying any names. It makes
most people happy.

We've had students call
from as far away as California
asking how to make egg salad.

And plenty of couples who are
married now used to come in
here when they were dating.
Like they say, we've seen
plenty of water go under the
bridge.

Students today just don’t act
as friendly as they used to. I
can remember the day when
we knew every boy’s name,
and most of them felt free to

ring up their purchases on the
cash register and make
change when it looked like we
were busy.

One batch of egg salad is
about the same as another
when you've done it hundreds
of times. We make it up about
eight gallons at a time now,
you know.

I think it's better than any
egg salad you can get
anywhere else. I feel just
crazy enough sometimes to do
what someone said in here one
day. Make up a big pot of egg
salad and put it outside at
night for the streakers.

After all, if Joe Namath can
wear panty hose, what can’t

you do these days.
