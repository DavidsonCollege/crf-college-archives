by the fact that when the members

they do not know who is to be the

marked,

Dean Davison told briefly about Mr.

Mr. Rhodes, Dr. Davison remarked,
“He showed the world not only what

Davidson Purchases

Ford V-8 Fire Engine

The city fathers have announced the
purchase of an ultra-modern Ford V8

fire engine Costing over three thou-
sand dollars, The truck is equipped
with modern fire-fighting accessories, |

including a pump that can exhaust
over four hundred gallons of water
a minute. This engine will replace
the ancient equipment that has em-/
barrassed the college and town in the
years past. |

Mr. E. N. Linker will hold the po-

sition of day fire chief and Mr. J. F.!

Riley will act as night chief. Due to
the fact that students are only in town

for nine months of the year, it will be |

necessary to organize a Volunteer com-
pany of about fifteen citizens. How-
ever, the students are expected, as in
the past, to furnish their own company
which will assist the citizens in any |
emergency.

tographer

The photographers for the 1934
“Quips and Cranks” have been
in Davidson since last Monday,
and expect to remain throughout
the week.

It was definitely stated by
members of the annual staff that
this is the photographers’ last
visit to Davidson, and that it will
be y for stud wish-
ing to have their pictures made
to make arrangements for sit-
tings this week.

Faculty pictures, fall
fraternity groups, and all other
campus activities are also being
made at the present time. The
photographer will return in the
spring to take the basketball,
baseball, and track pictures.

tographer from Philadelphia, all
students are urged to have their
pictures made before Saturday,
