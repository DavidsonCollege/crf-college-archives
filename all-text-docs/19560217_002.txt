Roses to the Chorus

This week's bucket of roses goes to
the Davidson College Male Chorus. Often
unexpressed but strongly felt is a warm
feeling of pride in the Chorus. Their
presence has significantly and memorably
enhanced chapel programs. alternate Ves-
per hours, and other college presenta-
tions. Those who have been fortunate
enough to hear them concertising in
hometowns realize the esteem in which
the Chorus is held abroad in the U. S.
Praise is duely attributable to both leader
and individual members whose time and
interest as well as ability have made the
Male Chorus a pleasing reality.

It would not be at all amiss for the
Chorus to record some of its more popu-
lar numbers along with traditional David-
son songs in an album for students,
friends, and alumni. Such albums filled
with rich music and memorable college
songs have been produced at many insti-
tutions of lesser quality. Male Chorus—
rise to the challenge.

Frosh Council a
Success

Also in line for a semester award is
the Freshman Council. Begun two years
ago as an idea, the Council has recently
realized itself in strong and productive
terms. Progress was made last year upon
the original social meetings, but this is the
first significant year in its brief history.

It has displayed ability and agressive-
ness in three particular fields thus far.
First, in the leadership and government
of the freshman class, it has given a very
helpful and encouraging hand to Fresh-
man Advisor. John Child. Especially
noticeable was the fluent and fruitful way
in which Freshman Parents Day was con-
ducted,

Secondly. the Freshman Council has
been instrumental in forming and contin-
uing a soccer team. New to the Davidson
campus, it was composed mostly of fresh-.
men; but future plans call for inter-col-
legiate competition on a regular schedule
with representation from the entire stu-
dent body. Third, the Council’s response
to the IFC proposal on housing dates for
dances was vital to the success of the
student program. They took over com-
plete arrangements for room assignments
for Midwinters—and should continue to
do so for Spring Frolics.

It has been suggested from several
sources that a freshman be allowed to sit
on the Student Council. Although it does
not seem advisable to have a freshman
voting member for the first semester, it
would be advantageous and effective to
include such a representative second se-
mester. Not only would an important
voice be added, but the benefit of closer
coordination with all classes through stu-
dent government could also be strongly
realized.

So to the Freshman Council—congrat-
ulations and our continued support.

IN MEMORIAM

On Monday, February 13, the family
and friends of Daniel Blain Woods met to
pay tribute to him in a corporate way
for the last time. Yet to a man like Dan
our tributes can find a continual expres-
sion. In his personality, intellect, and
achievement all find an expression of
those qualities which men covet.

This life contained depth, consecra-
tion. and integrity to which thoughtful
men aspire, for these are the character-
istics of a life lived in the light and ex-
ample of God.

The family and friends of Dan are
establishing the Daniel Blain Woods Me-
morial Scholarship at Davidson; here, too,
is the channel of living tribute, for the
help of others who strive to live for these
same ideals.

Resultful Teaching The Children Were Nestled ...... . by Cole

In the face of constantly changing con-
ditions, there are some principles of
teaching which remain everlastingly true.
One of them is this: The teacher has not
taught until the student has learned.

Students learn in an atmosphere of
praise‘ and cooperation. There is some-
thing about every student that the tea-
cher can praise. Even when praise is un-
deserved, an expression of confidence on
the part of the teacher will spur on the
student in a way that censure never can.

“The teachers I remember with most
regard.” wrote a famous journalist. “are
those who saw to it that I learned. That is
the teacher’s job. If he does that, nothing
else matters much; if he does not do that,
nothing else that he does will compensate.
Of the scores of teachers I have had, the
only one I remember with any conscious
lack of appreciation is a teacher who,
through easygoing but mistaken kindness,
failed to make me learn.”

There is no substitute in teaching for
sympathetic understanding and a kindly,
encouraging attitude toward students. A
knowledge of the “tricks of the trade” is
not enough.: It is the dimension of person-
ality which lends color and vitality to the
teacher's work and which. in the long last,
is the motivating force in learning.

“Davidson College has chosen as its
major goal for 1956 the raising of faculty
salaries. The income of the highest salar-
ied professor at Davidson is $43 less than
the average income of non-farm families
in the United States.”

Who can say that it is absolutely
wicked to pitch horseshoes on Sunday, or
that he who does so stands a slim chance

of getting into Heaven? But as this is the

day of “preparedness” and “safety first,”
let's be on the safe side and cut it out.
At any rate, we have noticed that very
few gentlemen indulge in the sport on
Sunday. Davidsonian, March 21, 1917.

It has been sadly noted by the dialing
contingency that dormitory telephone
operators, are amazingly inactive at
times. Long ringing of the Bell system
often brings loud silence. Annual con-
tacts, dating systems, and ‘¥Y’ works are
seriously impaired. Are the answerers on
strike, perennially sacked, or conscien-
tious objectors? Perhaps what we need
are a few female switchboard co-ops.

Reader Blasts Sports Editorial

Dear Editor:

From where does your so-called
sports editor receive his views on
college athletic policies? Is it that
he has been harbored under Da-
vidson’'s ideals, eg. that by losing
she will retain her sacred name of
scholarship and thereby remain
chaste, too long, or is he simply
so pig-headed as to think that
along with winning athletics comes
the damnable curse of countless
vices?

He surely. must think that all
athletes are goons; yet why do the
athletic teams consistently have
higher averages than the all-men’s
average? Is all we are to gain from
college to come from the pages of
books or the orations of. profes-
sors?

Davidson. could obtain better
athletes if, first. she could give
them a good offer, for naturally a
boy wilt generally favor the better
scholarship offer. Secondly, he
would like to go to a place he has
heard of and if he is from out of
the state it is more than likely he

‘Twas on a cool Midwinter’s eve
that the prospect of a glorious
Davidson weekend had collapsed
for young, cunning, maa-about-
campus, Joe Coolidge, for he had
just learned that the last-minute
blind date he had accepted so
foolishly had no merits or advance
notices other than the dubiously
valid distinction of rooming with
somebody’s sister. This was indeed
a slash to Joe's pride, but what
could he do... .?

While thus contemplating a res-
olution of this fate, Joe passed the
dorm phone booth, where a sad-
eyed, disillusioned Felix Freshman °

has never heard of this citadel of
learning. Third, and lastly, he
would want to go to a school where
something practical is taught and
which is not just a prep school
for post graduate work.

If your editor vould spend
more time writing about athletic
events on which he could just
present facts and not his own
warped, biased, childish thoughts
about events which are apparently
outside his own tight orbit of
morals he would have a much more
informative and enjoyable column.

exams should be exempt from the
exam in that course,
I think this would be a good tine

‘of action because if a student has

worked hard - enough throughout
the semester to have an A, or bet-
ter, he knows the material in that
course and a review of it for the
exam won't appreciably add to his
knowledge of that subject.

Then too, the students them-
selves will be. benefited for these
two following reasons. First, the
study he would have spent on the
exempted course can be applied
to his more troublesome course
thereby improving it. Secondly, this
plan will offer an incentive for
other students to try to do better.

JIM MARSHALL

Publisher Robinson’s Foreign
Policy Talk a Conglomeration

Mr. Robinson's observations on
U. S. foreign policy read much
better than he read them in Cha-
pel. He failed to disturb either
our matinal slumber or our lack
of international concern. But any-
one who heard his passionate an-
ti-McCarthy address two years ago

knows that Mr. Robinson can stim- |

ulate our student body. It was un-
fortunate that Mr. Robinson dis-
carded that Harvard crusading ap-
proach on his return engagement,
particularly since he chose the
equally famous Harvard motif of
the stuffed shirt.

His appeals to the ego of
the audience were as ineffi-
cacious as that of our ordinary
platform pedants. The nature
and material of Mr. Robinson’‘s
address was, however, a dis-
tinet compliment to the Stu-
dent Body. He assumed that
we knew something about
world affairs, and it is pos-
sible that he assumed too
much At any rate, he spread
before us a smoryasbord of
contemporary foreign affairs.
Any regurgitation here, there-
fore is limited.

UNITED NATIONS

Mr. Robinson, President and
Publisher of the Charlotte News,
agreed that the United Nations was
one tool in our quest for peace,
but drew the conclusion from ex-
perience that. the U. S. must act
unilaterally until the U. N._ be-
comes stronger and more cohesive.
The irony of his position, however,
is that the U. N. cannot become
stronger or more cohesive as long
as we continue to project and
practice unilateral policies outside
of the U. N. Although it may not
be feasible to entirely derive our
international strategy from the U.
N., there are organizations like
WHO and. UNESCO which can be
further utilized to strengthen the
U. N. and promote universal ame-
lioration.

By channeling our foreign eco-
nomic aid through the U. N. we
could prove to the world that we
are men of good will and that our
aid was not an honorarium for
air bases or military support. With
India and much of Asia and Africa
dividing their critical glances be-
tween us and the U.S. S. R., can
we afford not to rise ‘to a level
higher than Realpolitik?

We all know, and Mr. Rob-
inson reminded us, that the
Soviet Union is sending sei-
entists to these areas in an
attempt to prove that Com-
munism is the dynamic force
which is the panacea for all
their ills. The U. S. S. R. only

Thus was our Felix beset with

since (since the tour of the cam-
pus that afternoon, to be exact)
realized the folly of resistance. An
extended seige was unnecessary,
and the attacking force soon pre-
sented its terms with a deceptive
smile: “Fe-e-elix, wouldn’t you

for, indeed, prayers do not
quite reach the halfstarved

DIPLOMACY THE SEDROCK

Yet Mr. Robinson insists that,
despite military and economic sup-
ports diplomacy must be the bed-
rock of our foreign policy. He
redefines diplomacy as “the great
art of understanding and getting
along in a peaceful fashion with
people of an entirely different
heritage, outlook and economic
status.” In brief, his definition is
challenging, but his application. is
regressive and anachronistic in its
contingencies.

His call to take up the Democra-
tic Cross reminds one of the ludic-
rous and ineffective fervor of a
Somerset Maugham missionary.
This is not to say that Mr. Robin-
son is wrong when he urges some
of us to give up our search for
material ‘comforts and to devote
our personality to this “rewarding
crusade;” indeed, he is right.

But is not he forgetting his own
definition of diplomacy when he
speaks of “taking the light of our
American Democracy into some
dark corner of a foreign land.”
An attitude of internal superiority
reinforced with superiority by
comparison will be repulsive to
any nation, particularly those who
are beginning to feel a pride in the
color of their skin.

NATIONAL CULTURES

For one system to presume
to have the right or the abili-
ty to superimpose itself upon
any other system is arrogance.
Our diplomats must look be-
yond the trappings of Ameri-
can Democracy to an ideal
which can be integrated in
all culture without the dere-
cination of time-honored pol-
itical myths and religious
faiths. To destroy the roots
of a culture is to introduce
the protocol of open santago-
nism and overt rebellion.

The relationship between na-
tions must be a reciprocal one
where the ideas and attitudes of
the one are understood and co-
alesced with those of the other.
Only then will peace and brother-
hood be realized in One World
which provides a multiplicity of
outlets for self-ex pression.

Unfortunately, Mr. Pobin-
son cannot see the world
forest for the American tree,
sequoias though they be.
