Poland, a pope and peaceful

By LOUIS ORTMAYER

Professor of Political Science

Poland —the home of kielbasa
and ethnic humor? Is the Pope
Italian? Despite the perhaps
rhetorical nature of these ques-
tions for the casual observer,
the dramatic elevation to the
leadership of the Roman Catho-
lic world of a non-Italian, a Pole
may serve to awaken more
informed interest in. a unique
land called Poland.

Pope John Paul II as Karol
Cardinal Wojtyla carried on the
work of the Church in a socio-
political environment that will
be much analyzed for clues to
future Vatican policies. Wojtyla
is shaped by and in turn has

himself helped to shape the .

dynamically changing context
of a Polish nation which is at
once Catholic, communist, and
Politically restless. Wojtyla’s

—

lish primate Stefan Cardinal
Wyszynski, Wojtyla as Arch-
bishop of Krakow has modera-
ted Wyszynski’s hardline anti-
communist stance! and
smoothed over Wyszynski’s
long-smoldering feud with the
Vatican diplomatic bureaucra-
cy Wojtyla is seen as a very
capable negotiator, adminstra-
tor, and astute observer of the
political scene. He has helped to
move the Polich Church toward
@ more securé and less antago-
nistic relationship with the
communists without at the
same time alienating or under-
mining the authority of his
superior Cardinal Wyszynski.
Such political and social bar-
gaining skills should serve him
well in the position of Pope.
‘Wojtyla has also been adept
in pursuing the Polish
Church’s traditional tasks—the
propagation and preservation of
the faith, extension of the
freedom to practive religion,

and safeguarding the nation’s.

unity through this common
faith. The dedication of the
celebrated church in the Kra-
kow suburb of Nowa Huta is a
noteworthy example. Not only

background is influenced by a_ sion for the building after long

variety of factors relating to the
struggle of a powerful Catholic
Church in Poland which has
sought to safeguard its own
vital space against encroach-
ments by a communist. system
claiming to be absolute.
__ -The important fact to remem-
ber about Poland is that Catho-
licism has been an inseperable
part of Polish national life for
centuries. To be Catholic and
Polish is to be doubly patriotic
because the faith and the na-
tion, to the majority of Poles,
are identical.

Therefore, the Polish Catholic
hierarchy has been able to
operate under unique national
conditions in negotiating wor-
king arrangements with the
post-World War II communist
government. Long and labori-
ous negotiations have taken
place between Polish Church
leaders and the Warsaw regime
to regularize conditions for Ca-
tholic believers.

Church-state accomodation
has recently been facilitated by
Pope Paul VI’s intentions to
reach viable and secure working

ments for the Catholic
Shurch across the whole of
communist Eastern Europe: In
view of the Polish Church’s
anchor in the national climate
and consciousness, as well as
the Polish hierarchy’s claim to a
natural, on-the-spot under-
standing of the phenomenon of
communism, the Polish bishops
over the yearp have tended to

resist what they have some- _

times seen as political interfe-
rence ‘in Polish religious affairs
by the Vatican.

Cardinal Wojtyla has been
instrumental in bringing the
Polish Church, the Vatican, and
the Warsaw government toge-
ther to discuss the problems
and possibilities of normalized
relations. ;

munity. Now, in the center of
the socialist model of the future,
the workplace of the proletariat,
stands one fo the most architec-
turally innovative and pride-in-
spiring monuments of the Kra-
kow region—a Roman Catholic
Church— anathema of the Leni-
nist state. The gleaming con-
crete and glass structure stands
in glaring contrast to the drab
monotony around it of govern-
mental architecture in the “so-
cialist realism”’ style.

Wojtyla as a top administra-
tor and intellectual guide of the
Polish Catholic Church has also
had to come to terms With the
impact of the wave of political
and social dissent which has
swept Poland in recent years.
As a witty prelate in the Polish
delegation to the Vatican re-
marked not long ago, when
queried how Polish Catholics
were faring with the communist
system, “Oh, fine. . . You see,
we are no longer enemy number
one. The workers are.’’ This
comment refers to the rise of
workers’ opposition to Warsaw
government policies which has
joined with intellectual dissent
movenients to form such influ-
ential protest associations as
the Workers’ Defense Commit-
tee and its successor the Com-
mittee of Social Self-Defense.
(KOR)

In the past, given Cardinal
Wyszynski’s deeply held mis-
trust of ‘‘atheistic’’ intellectu-
als, the Polish Church has

_ rendered little support for the

Polish intellectual” dissent

movement. Recent attempts
have been made, however, by
socialist intellectuals,such as
KOR militant Adam Michnik,
author of The Church, the Left
and the Dialogue, to find some
middle ground of agreement
with the Church toward agita-
ting for reform against an
authoritarian state. Now the
moderate wing of the: Polish
hierarchy, led by Wojtyla, has
moved to cooperate with the
protest movements by calling
for human rights, toleration of

- dissent, institutional reform,

and more freedoms for non-
communist social groups.

Workers’ power is apparent
in Poland, their riots having
toppled the regime in 1970 and
threatened it again in 1976. In
this tense political climate the
role of the Polish Catholic
Church has become extremely
important to the current com-
munist party leadership headed
by Edward Gierek. The Warsaw
government has increaseingly
relaxed restrictions on religious
instruction, facilitated church
construction, and passed favor-
able church tax measures in
order to curry the favor of
Polish Catholics. In the food
riots of the summer 1976, the
Catholic hierarchy responded
by urging calm and calling for
social cooperation until the
government could seek to reme-
dy some of the more glaring
grievances pronounced by the
striking workers.

Alum endorses classical music;
shocked at staff ‘vandalism’

Dear Davidson Students:

Not knowing how to contact
the students who have operated
FM Station WDAV I am direct-
ing this letter to you, hoping
you can pass its contents on to
the students who have operated
WDAV.

Not being there, I am not
qualified to pass judgment on

Letter to the Editor

__ the differences that have arisen
between the students and the
college administration.

I am disappointed in the lack
of broadcasts of the radio
station. As a lover of classical
music, I would like for WDAV
to give more time to the broad-
cast of this kind of music.

There seems to be a great
amount of jazz, and popular

music broadcast by the many
radio stations in and around
Charlotte, but a very limited
amount of classical music.

When I first heard of WDAV
being granted the use of more
power, I hoped this would result
in listeners in the enlarged area
getting more classical music.
We get WDAV very well in
High Point.

SGA referendum:
poor word choice?

To the Editor:

I support student control of
WDAV, but I find the wording
of the recent SGA referendum
concerning WDAV insincere,
now useless, and laughable.

It is sad that the Senate
would use such a phrase as
“ethically irresponsible,” which
can serve no other purpose than
to weaken their position. The
Senate’s position was a sound
one, but why bring ethics into
the matter? Why weaken your
argument by basing part of it
on a phrase that no one can
defend as right or wrong?

The first two parts of the
referendum dealing with ediica-
tion and finances can be suppor-
ied in fact, ethics cannot.

Any influence the referendum
might have had with the admin-

istration or trustees ‘is gone
because of the use of the phrase
“ethically irresponsible.” Why
slap someone in the face when
you don’t need to?

The effectiveness of the Sen-
ate decreases each time. they
scream like children. I was a
Senator for two years and was
bitterly disillusioned by the
general conduct of the Senate in
matters such as this. The
Senate was a waste of time, and
now I fear it will be powerless

for a long time to come.

It is sad that the students
lost control of WDAV. It is
sadder still that they don't
know an intelligent, mature
way to get it back.

- The possibility of getting
broadcasts of football and bas-
ketball games interested me
very much. I have enjoyed so
much the broadcasts of the
football games thus far, and
was looking forward to the
coming basketball games.

Unfortunately, this may not
happen.

I was really shocked by the
vandalism of the control board
of the station. I see no excuse of
this sort of thing. I understand
that this will mean the station
will be off the air for several
weeks.

As most, if not all the
broadcast equipment was dona-
ted to Davidson, this was like a
slap in the face of the generous
donors. It certainly will not help
the good image Davidson has. I
want to protest this action.

I hope the station will be/put
back on the air as soon as it is
possible.

accomodation

between party bureaucracy and
human rights groups and wor-
kers has been the Catholic
Church. Without entering into
the fight itself, the Church
asserted itself as a force without
which the party cannot govern
Poland. By its recent outspo-
kenness and willingness to cou-
sider dialogue with Marxist
intellectuals, the Church has
helped to consolidate reformist
and critical intellectual move-
ments in Poland, without tou-
ching off a potentially costly
dispute with the government.

Wojtyla's penchant for and
facility with quiet diplomacy,
his ability to reconcile opposing
viewpoints and skill as mediator
should be major assets to his
reign. as Pope John Paul II.
Wojtyla has rather conservative
positions on Church dogma as
well as a native Polish sense of
bolstering and protecting an
embattled institution. But de-
spite that, perhaps the Western
world and Roman Catholicism
in particular will come to appre-
ciate what many Poles (inclu-
ding Marxist-trained intelleetu-
als) have come to recognize
—that liturgical and political
renewal has percolated more
deeply down into Poland’s Ca-
tholic subsoil than is generally
credited in the West.

Wojtyla was the administra-
tor, Catholic pastoral preacher,
and institutional protector par
excellance in Poland, but he
always realized that the more
flamboyant and outspoken
Wyezynski was the local man in
charge. In his new office, an
authority second to none, with
his profound learning and com-
mand of languages, with his
innately Polish sense of pastoral
duty and opportunity, and with
a deep sense’ of social justice
after experience with totalita-
rian regimes, Wojtyla may well
emerge as the Catholic leader
most sensitive to the realities of
a changing and often hostile
world. He recognizes the need
for the Catholic Church to
accomodate itself to these
changes without forsaking its
religious and moral mission,
and care for the pastoral and
social needs of its believers.

The Polish environment is far

from an ideal experimental la-

boratory for perfecting such
new accommodation arrange-
ments, but it has tested the
mettle of the man who is now
called John Paul and found him.
