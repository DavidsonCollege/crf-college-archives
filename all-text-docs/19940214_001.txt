Basketball moves to
no. 2 in conference

By Will Cobb
Last week, Davidson took a
big step by avenging an early sea-
son’loss to The Citadel, coupled
with a victory on the road over a
scrappy Furman team. The two
wins have helped move the Cats up
to second place in the conference
standings, trailing UT-Chatta-
nooga now by only half a game.
Things are really heating up for
men’s basketball as Davidson ex-
tends it’s winning streak to seven,
the longest for coach Bob McKillop

since he arrived in 1989.

Neither game ended up close
as experience helped the Cats hold
off both teams late in the game. By
using scoring spurts when needed,
the Cats upped their season record

to 16-5. With five games remain-
ing on the schedule, the home
stretch is here, with each game
carrying significant importance.

For the first time since 1986,

thoughts of post-season play dance
in our heads.

Of the five games, four in-
volve conference play, including a
road trip to 4th place App. State
anda home game against 3rd place
ETSU. But the one non-confer-
ence game is a big one which will
be this Tuesday against county ri-
val UNCCatthe sold-out Indepen-
dence Arena in Charlotte. The only
tickets remaining are 100-150 stu-
dent tickets being sold at the ticket

STD outbreak only a rumor

By Katherine Hash

Rumors of a gonorrhea out-
break circulated on campus after
Residence Life issued amemourg-
ing hall counselors and RAs to
keep their hall medicine cabinets
stocked with condoms.

The memo, issued on Febru-
ary 3 by RLO director Richard
Terry, pointed to increasing num-
bers of cases of chlamydia and
genital warts on campus due to
lack of condom use and urged hall
counselors and RAs to keep con-
doms available. The memo never
implied an increase in gonorrhea.

Health Educator Georgia
Ringle, however, is not aware of
any increase in cases of sexually
transmitted diseases on campus.

in STDs was mistakenly referred
to in the memo as a campus trend
but is actually a national trend.
Ringle argues that, though STDs

_ do exist at Davidson, national sta-

tistics are not necessarily repre-
sentative of the situation at
Davidson, where the student body
is not composed of high risk groups.

According to Terry, the na-
tion-wide increase in STDs, com-
bined with a decrease in the num-
ber of condom packets being pre-
pared by the RLO for residence
halls, led the RLO staff to believe
that students were either “having
less sex or having less protected
sex.”

The staff is concerned because

Continuing a long-standing
tradition, the Davidson Board of
Trustees will raise students’ tu-
ition for the upcoming school year.
However, the 7.1% tuition increase
is the lowest Davidson has seen in
years.

At its winter meeting on Feb-
ruary 3 and 4, the board deter-
mined next year’s budget, which
includes a 7.1% increase over this
year’s tuition and fees. This raise
is the lowest annual increase in
Davidson’s tuition and fees since
1977.

Total charges for 1994-1995
will be $22,534, which includes
$17,464 of required charges (tu-
ition, laundry, and activity fees)
and is based on a double occu-
pancy room rate of $2,650 and the
dining service’s full meal plan at
$2,420. The 1993-94 college cata-
log lists this year’s total tuition and
fees at $21,037.

President John Kuykendall
notes that “the two major objects
of our increased revenues will be
faculty and staff compensation
and financial aid for students.
With the exception of a few very
urgent needs, every other aspect
of the budget is being maintained
at virtually level funding.”

He also explains that the
7.1% increase “represents the
most significant step thus far in
reducing the rate of growth. It is
our sincere intention to continue
the effort to reduce the size of that
increase, and we hope to be able
to move the annual percentage
rate even lower next year and in
the years following.”

Junior Sara Withers says that
she chose Davidson because she
loved the school but also because

it was less expensive than many

northern schools. “Now,” she
says, “it doesn’t seem to me as
much of an advantage.”

| Trustees vote to raise tuition 7.1%

Withers worries that middle-
class families will no longer be
able to afford Davidson any more
and will not be able to qualify for
need-based assistance.

Junior Gautam Srinivasan says
that “raising tuition is nothing un-
expected.” He feels that students
at Davidson are getting their
money’s worth now, but he is un-
sure if that will be true if costs get
too high.

Srinivasan’s major concern is
that some students who want to
come to Davidson may not be able
to afford it if costs increase too
much.

In contrast to those views, jun-
ior B.J. Rudell notes that the low
percentage increase over last year’s
costs “is the best news we’ve had
in 16 years.” He feels that if costs
weren’t increased, the school
would suffer because it could not
provide students with a high qual-
ity of education.

Davidson recycles— and wastes

By Mary Clare Jalonick

Recycling is a very important
part of environmental awareness
today, yet it is often neglected.
Here at Davidson, there has been a
concerted effort to try and recycle
allitems that can be recycled. Nev-
ertheless, those who have been or-
ganizing the recycling effort have
run into many obstacles.

What do we recycle now?

Davidson Recycles is the stu-
dent-run effort that handles recy-
cling within the dorms, Baker,
Patterson Court, senior apartments,
the computer center, Chambers,

ows and Jean DeMoss, Davidson
Recycles collects aluminum cans,
office paper, newspaper and plas-
tics, but no glass. The Physical
Plant collects recyclables around
campus and takes the goods to the
recycling shed, where it is sorted
by students. From there, the
recyclables are handled by a re-
cycling company hired by
Davidson.

The Union handles its recy-
cling independently. It formerly
diditsrecycling within Davidson,
but found it more efficient to

help of four work-study students,
the union takes the material col-
lected in the recycling bins to a
Cornelius recycling center.

Vail Commons and dining ser-
vices recycle only cardboard; they
say that is the only thing they use in
large enough amounts. Conces-
sions recycles paper products when
there are large events, but more
often than not, the paper products
that they use are non-recyclable.

What are the problems?

The recycling shed to which
the materials are taken causes one
