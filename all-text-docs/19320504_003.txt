Davidson’s track season was brought to
a close Saturday when the Wildcat cinder
representatives administered defeat to a hith-
erto unbeaten University of South Carolina
team. The victory made Davidson's fourth
of the season against two losses. The Wild-
cats lost their first two meets, one with
Florida and the other with Duke; but soon
hit their stride to defeat V. P. I., V. M. I,
Wake Forest, and South Carolina in con-
secutive meets.

Led by Bostick, the South Carolinians tried
hard to avenge a one-sided defeat handed
them by Davidson last year, and were lead-
ing by one point at the beginning of the
final event, but Dickerson, Little and Flinn
placed one, two, three for the Wildcats in
the broad jump to make a clean sweep of
the final event and give Davidson a well-
earned 67-59 victory.

Alex “Nuts” Earle, Davidson distance run-
ner, furnished the surprise of the meet by
actually leading the field in the mile run
from the start of the race. Heretofore Earle
had a habit of staying behind until the final
lap when he would always sprint to place in
the event. But not Saturday. Instéad, “Nuts”
set his own pace and finished the mile in 4
minutes 38.8 seconds to tie the college record
for the mile run. And after winning that
event, Earle entered the two-mile run and
tied for second with John Howard, who also
placed in the mile run.

In defeating Wake Forest, the Wildcats
had things their own way, and piled up more
than 117 points while permitting the Deacons
only 8 2-3 points. The Deacons got four of
their total by taking third place in events
that Davidson had entered only two contest-
ants. Who dares say that such a victory
doesn’t avenge the defeats Wake Forest
teams handed the Wildcats in other athletic
contests?

The Freshman track team contributed its
part to the joy of Captain Pritchett and
Coach Whittle by turning in impressive vic-
tories over Wake Forest Freshmen and over
Salisbury High School. The ’Kittens crushed
the little Deacons by a 96-30 score last
Wednesday, and turned back the high school
lads 72 to 45 on Friday, to end their season
with better than a fifty-fifty average.

N. C. State’s baseball team will invade
Richardson Field Friday to engage the Wild-
cats for the second time this season. That
is, the visitors will be here if all the mem-
bers of the Wolfpack squad are able to
thumb their way from Raleigh to Davidson,
since it seems that State College has run out
of funds with which to finance athletics.

Let’s all turn out and support the Wild-
cats in their last home game of the season.
And don’t forget to STAND during the sev-

enth inning.

Mount Pleasant Gives
Freshmen First Loss

The Wildkitten baseball team suffered their
first defeat this season on last Thursday when’
Mount Pleasant Collegiate Institute nosed them
out by a score of 7 to 4. It was the Freshmen’s
second game with the Cadets, the former one
ending in a 6-0 victory for the ’Kittens.

Fink, pitching for Mount Pleasant, held the
Fresh to seven hits, while his teammates slug-
ged thirteen off Ashton and Coble. In the ninth
inning the ’Kittens made a brave but unsuc-
cessful rally, running in three men.

On last Tuesday, April 26, the Davidson
Freshman baseball team scored a very decisive
victory over the Charlotte High School nine
here, downing the visitors 10 to 3.

Harris, of Davidson, and Mulligan, of Char-
lotte, both pitched nice games and starred in
the hitting. Harris hit safely three times in
four attempts and Mulligan got a single and
a homer in three trips.

Mills for the lead last week, dropped eighteen

No changes occurred in the other depart-

Wildcat Cindermen Will
Compete in State Meet

Team batting:

The Davidson varsity track team and a few
members of the Freshman team will leave here
Friday for Chapel Hill, where they will parti-
cipate in the North Carolina state track meet.
The meet, which is held annually at the uni-
versity, will begin Saturday afternoon at 2:00
o'clock and will be a regular meet for both
varsity and Freshmen separately.

The colleges to be represented by teams this
year are: Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest, David-
son, State, Guilford, Elon, and High Point.

The varsity men making the trip from here
are: Fleagle, McMillan, Hallyburton,. McGehee,
O'Keefe, Cannon, Gwynn, Corbin, Earle, How-
ard, Morrow, Brannon, Cochran, Knox, Dill,
Bettis, Martin, Rhyne, Flinn, T. H. McCallie,
R. L. McCallie, Little, Pratt, Roane, Johnson,
and Brown.

The Freshmen are: Dulin, Glasgow, Gullette,
Gammon, H. Morris, E. F. McPhail, MeI1winen,
McFadyen, Potter, Lee, and B. Rose.

Last year Davidson showed up exceptionally
well at the state meet which was held in Greens-
boro. Brannon placed second in the two-mile
run; R. L. McCallie placed second in the high
hurdles, and fourth in the low hurdles; Little
placed third in the high hurdles and third in
the low hurdles, and Earle took third in the
mile run. The Wildcats took the first three
places in the high hurdles and the first, third
and fourth in the lows as Graham George, '31,
of Davidson took first in both events.

The teams have been working hardithis week
in order to be in the best trim for the big. meet,
and it is hoped that the Wildcats will make an
even better showing this year than they did

last year.

Baseball Teams Defeat |
Wildcat Nine Last Week|

Lose by Scores of 14-5 to Tar Heels
and 16-2 to Wolfpack

The baseball team of Davidson College re- |
turned last Thursday from a most unsuccessful
two-day invasion of Chapel Hill and Raleigh,
being completely routed in games with the Uni-
versity of North Carolina and N. C. State.

The first of the two contests between Da-
vidson and the Tar Heels resulted in an over-
whelming victory for the boys from Chapel Hill
by a 14 to 5 count. Fourteen hits, coupled with
five miscues, spelled defeat for the Wildcat nine,
as the Heels let loose a barrage of heavy ar-
tillery that drove Southpaw Pearce from the
hillock in the seventh, after he had been touched
for thirteen bingles, including a double,
triples, and a pair of circuit clouts,

Peacock, Carolina centerfielder, led the at-
tack on the Wildcat slab artist by taking four
out of four for a perfect day at the bat. Buck
Mills led the local contingent with two hits out
of four trips to the platter. However,
for Carolina was in fine form,

The big inning for Davidson was the
enth, when they scored their last three runs on
singles by Mclean, Mills, and Mathis, accom-
panied by three Tar Heel errors. Carolina ap-
peared to be able to score at will throughout,
and their batting sprees were rather well \dis-
tributed throughout the eight brackets in which
they came to the plate.
