Unlike its older and better knawn
rival to the north, Cape Lookout
National Seashore remains largely
unspoiled by human hands. Up the
voad apiece is Hatteras National
Seashore, with a paved highway
forming a spine down its sandy back;
small villages serve the local populace
and transients with various degrees of
suceess.

None of these amenities or their
related problems exist on the three
| islands that make up the National
Seashore, but that doesn’t mean that
they are without some problems of
their own.

Some of the land on the Core Bank
and most of the property on the
adjacent Shackleford Banks is still
privately owned. The State and the

Interior departments are slowly buy-
ing up land and residences but this
has not been favorably received by
those who have invested their money,
time, and parts of their lives in the
islands. An undercurrent of resent-
ment blows over the islands with. the

shifting sands.

Still, Cape Lookout offers some
pleasures available nowhere else,
unless your granddaddy happened to
have bought an island far duck hunts

Straining against wind and sky
above scrub-dappled sand dunes in an
eighteen-foot hang-glider is one way
to experience the fall season that
hasn't really caught on with Davidson
students yet.

If all the hard-core kite addicts on
campus got together, they could
probably comfortably spend the re-

mainder. of the year in one dorm room:

“Around here,”’ admitted one stu-
dent enthusiast, Mike Busch, with a
thoughtful pause, ‘‘it’s not too terri-
bly popular.”’

‘Most people think they would
enjoy hang-gliding — but they just
don’t have the coordination. They
bite the dust a lot,"’ he explained.

Ever since he took his first flight as
a high school sophomore in Grand
Rapids, Michigan, Busch has found

that for him kites offer a wonderful ~

release, an experience in freedom.

four feet off the ground it’s an
incredible experience,’’ he said.

Between the mountains and the
outer banks-the Davidson vicinity
offers some of the best kiting areas in
the country, according to Busch.

* “There are established places where

people like to go—Grandfather’s
Mountain and Nag’s Head are two of
the most popular."’

Although many people shy away
from hang-gliding, for fear that it is
too dangerous, Busch seemed to feel
that it is no more dangerous than
other sports.

“It's safe if.you follow the precau-
tions. But it can be as dangerous as
you want. If you go out there and act
careless you're gonna get yourself

killed,” he warned.

Busch recommended that people
just starting out not try it on their
own. ‘‘It's best to go out with a
licensed instructor, It takes years of
practice to develop good judgment,
but you can get the basic elementary
stuff down in one afternoon off of a
small hill for around $20."

instructors in this part of the state
happens to work in town. Terry Harp,

‘part-owner of the Peregrine How

restaurant. has given lessony to
college students before.

“T.take anybody that wants to go. I
furnish all equipment — harness, hel:

The bight area of Cape Lookout is
perhaps the best shelling area in
North Carolina and is only three miles
from the ferry. Also in thet direction
is Les and Sally’s Stone, a boid-out
from private ownership days. They
are wonderful people to talk with
