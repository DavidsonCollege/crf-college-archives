HEAR CORDON:

For the past few years, students have given
the excuse for not attending musicals and
other presentations that the artists weren't
famous enough—that we never have great
musicians perform here. In answer to this
complaint, Phi Mu Alpha and the Music De-
partment have coordinated to bring to the
campus one of the more famous opera singers
in the nation—Norman Cordon of Metropoli-
tan fame.

If students turn out for this performance,
it will gain for the sponsors the foothold with
which they might cling in order that they
might continue their high level of musical
entertainments. Norman Cordon is perhaps
the greatest singer we've had at Davidson for

the past five years.

Here are a few excerpts from the critical

columns of American newspapers:

New York Times: “Mr. Cordon, a North
Carolina basso, brought considerable dramatic
emphasis to his interpretation, both vocally

Philadelphia Public Ledger: “Condon as Zun-
°
iga, an unusually authoritative delineation.”
Cincinnati Times: “Hearing Norman Cor-
don’s unusually beautiful voice is always worth
the price of admission, no; matter how short

’

a phrase he may sing.’

Although the above criticism is a bit one-
sided, we are assured that Phi Mu Alpha and
the Music Department have given us an op-

portunity that should be accepted whole-
heartly and with readiness.

,

As the time draws nearer for voices to get
in harmony, the different groups on the camp-
us should be thinking of the presentation to
be given on Chambers steps—the inter-fra-
ternity sing. As a suggestion to the person
in charge of chapel services, the winner of the
~competition might be presented in a chapel
exercise. Should this idea prove successful we
see no reason for not making the presentation
in chapel another Davidson custom.

What concrete benefits Uncle Sam received
from this visit have, as yet, not been disclosed,

Yes, the recruiting officers have come and

But is that a sign that we won’t rally to the
Colors if and when the need arises? Is that a
premonition that American Youth is afraid to
die that others may enjoy “life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness?” I think not. For
the youth of our land is made of the same
stuff that the youth of former generations
vas made. °

We, the American Youth, realize that the
“War to end Wars” was a flop... a comedy. . .
a play on words, Whether or not we ourselves
must fight is not certain, but sooner or later
our great nation, if it desires to remain demo-

Hell. When that day comes the youth of the
land will spring into action. to the
supreme sacrifice, if that be necessary. For
life that is shackled by totalitarianism is not
worth living, and we believe that under God,

‘THE DANCE, WEEKEND, OR:
HOW TO KEEP YOUR SHEEP
WITHIN THE FOLD.

The problem of how to divide
your time between your date, your
and your professor on a
dance weekend is indeed perplexing
to the ordinary freshman, and
sometimes, even to the sophomore.

A freshman usually begins by
preparing an extravagant program
for the benefit of his date, worked
out weeks ahead of time. A typical
one was found in a fourth floor
garbage can recently. For Satur-
day, the poor fish had laboriously
worked out to the split second an
elaborate schedule as follows: 8:00:
get up; 8:05; put talcum powder
under eyes; 8:25: go to class; 8:26:
worry about how Flower Mae will
wake up; 9:30: coffee at Pep; 9:45:
to wake up Flower
Mae; 10:15: take Flower to chapel;
10:45: take Flower Mae to class,
so that she can see that “darling
professor you're always talking
about;” 12:30: take Flower Mae to
lunch; 1:00: take Flower Mae to
that “darling little fraternity
house ;” 3:30: leave for tea dance;
4:00: get to tea dance; 4:30: tea
begins: 6:30: leave tea

dunnit”. John Hubbard and Mar-
jorie Weaver have more murders
on hand than they can solve, and
not until nineteen of the twenty
men who hold ‘a multiple insurance
policy are murdered does light
dawn. Miss Weaver turns in a good
portrayal of’ a dumb bunny and
John Hubbard is at his best.

The other feature billed for this
day is “Dangerous Games”.
Chming soon are “The Great Lie”,

“Men of Boy’s Town”, arid “That
Hamilton Woman”.

I would like for Jay Bolin to be
the guest of the theatre for ‘any

schedule

As for sophomores, the general
concensus of opinion is that they
do not bind thentselves to their
schedules quite as rigidly as do the
freshmen. A rubber of bridge will
probably be substituted for the
blank space which appeared in the
freshman’s program of events for
the afternoon. We must realize that
by this time a student has learned
that you can’t make time with a
woman if you don’t have your eyes
on her all the time. Besides, a few

pointers from Blackwood and Cul-
bertson will impress -her with your
sophistication and mature intellect.
Then, again, the sophomore gen-
erally borrows enough lettuce to
put the feedbag on his date after
the dance, and this makes for a
more glamorous, showy, weekend.
Juniors are lucky fellows. We say
this because they don't have Fort
Jackson or the problem of job-
hunting facing them right away. In
these strenuous-times; another year
spent in the collegiate whirl is not
a bad thought, after all. These
fellows, well-experienced in the
arts of repartee and Epicureanism,
take life very nonchalantly. Being
an hour late to the dances means
nothing in their carefree, disorder-
ed lives. As for sleeping—late to
bed and early to rise is their mid-
dle moniker, They are so lucky
that they don’t even have to plan
for a rubber of bridge on Saturday
afternoon. Something | exciting or
unusual always turns up at the last
moment. They never know what
will happen ‘next and_ therefore,
never make any definite plans for
the otherwise dull spots on the
daily reminder. Sometimes, they do
slip into the armory in the after-
noons to see how the band sounds.
Steeped in mystery and intrigue
the senior’s weekend. Tales of
big deals and high society life con-
tinually are whispered around the
campus about this dignified group.
To begin with, these luminaries
think nothing of a short drive
down to Confab College on Satur-
day afternoon to see Gussie~ Lou
Monette crowned . queen of the
"May. ‘Where were-you Jast-night?”
seems to be the favorite topic of
conversation among these guys.
In conclusion, we must observe
that the most uniearried and. un-
initiated of these four groups has
the most sensible attitude: Keep up
the good work, freshmen, and
don’t be influenced by any big

is

deal upperclassmen.
