Asst. Sports Editor

A lack of practice and an un-
certain pitching staff are the
big ques:ion marks facing the
Davidson Wildcat baseball team.
which opens its season today at
Guilford

Coach Tom Stevens hopes to
discover some answers to those
questions in that game, and also
tomorrow when the Cats host
perennial Carolinas Conference
power Pfeiffer at 2 p.m.

Stevens sighted the early
spring break as a drawback to
the preparations for the sea-
s0n.

“We have been very slow get-
ting in shape, and we still need
more work. Ordinarily we would
have played several practice
games by now, but the early
break has given us only a week
of practice,” he explained.

The games with Guilford and
Pfeiffer will help Stevens see
how his squad will react in
pressure sivuations, something
he has been unable to observe
because of the necessary em-
phasis on conditioning and fun-
damentals.

Fogleman Rehired
As Soccer Coach

Despite an effort to resign,
Harry Fogleman will remain as
soccer coach.

Fogleman entered his resig-
nation several weeks ago and it
was temporarily accepted by
the administration.

Dr. Tom Scott, director of
athletics, said that he asked Fo-
gleman to take the job back
when he could not find a re-
placement.

‘I felt I had to go back,”
Fogleman commented, ‘rather
than let the program die for
lack of a coach.”

‘“T had wanted to resign be-
cause of the expanded tennis
program heie,” Fogleman add-
ed. “It will. take up a good deal
of my time.”

Scott evidently offered the
job to Assistant Soccer Coach
Peter Sterling, who turned it
down due to prior commitments
at the College Union.

sae

The uncertainty troubling the
mound siaff is mainly due to
Davis Beaston's sore arm, which
has been bothering him all win-
ter according to Stevens.

“It will be a real blow to us
if he can't pitch,” said Stevens.
“because we are counting on
him as a starter. Rick Pipan al-
so has not come along as fast I
had hoped, amd we need him to
be ready soon.”

Pipan and Beaston were main-
S.ays on last year's club. Pipan,
a senior. posted a 7-5 mark and
a 182 ERA while hurling 94 in-
nings. Beaston is a junior and
was the ace reliever last sea-
son as he recorded four saves.

The pitching load will fall on
two sophomores, Ross Manire
and Frank Folger, and a senior,
Mike Frye. These’ veterans
should receive help from junior
Greg Cameron, who hasn't play-
ed since his freshman year, and
freshmen Dwight Plemmons and
Joe Duncan.

The hitting phase of the game
offers Stevens more comfort
than pitching, at least on paper.
‘'We have more power this year,
and the potential to score more
runs,” he observed.

Wilkerson returns as the top

Face Tough SC Challenge

Graduation and transfers have
hurt this year's edition of coach
Harry Fogleman’s Davidson
College tennis team.

Last year’s Southern Confer-
ence champs, with a 19-5 over-
all record, lost most of their
Strength with the graduation of
Jim Cantrell and Jeff Chetwood
and the “‘tranfers of Bob Koury
(Wake Forest), Jeff Dumansky
(Delaware), and Hy Lankenau
(Hollins).

All, except Lankenau, were
individual Southern Conference
champs last year. .

Though these departures hurt
considerably, there is still a re-
turning nucleus of four players,
Bill Allen, Bill Dupcnt, David
Weaver. and Frank Dana,

301. Wilkerson was named to
the ‘all-conference team last
year.

The infield appears to be solid
both offensively and defensive-
ly. Junior Lynn Wagner starts
at firs: base for the third
straight year. and he posted a
.273 average.

Second-sacker .Jack Latimer
hit .302 before suffering a knee
injury last season, and Stevens
is anxious for him to regain
that form.

Shortstop Jack Willits was the
leading batter for last year’s
squad with a .354 mark, and he
slammed three home: runs and
stole nine bases to pace those
categories.

Stevens is particularly pleas-
ed with the play of freshman
Mark Rodgman at third base.
“Mark is really a catcher but
he is so quick and has a good
arm, that he can do well at
third for us. He is a good hitter
as well.”

Another freshman, George
Weicker, lends some needed ver-
satility to the infield. ‘He can
play either second, third or the
outfield and he can hit with
power,” commented Stevens.

Senior Bill Barnhill returns as
the centerfielder. and he is

counted on for consistency by

around which a representative
Davidson club can be built.

Only Weaver is a returning
individual champ.

To fill out the squad, a double
elimination tournament was
held in the fall to determine
which players would make the
team.

In addition to those already
mentioned, three sophomores.
Gary Bressler, Scoot Dimon, and
Jim Dorsett, plus Rick Quinby,
a freshman, and Gary Smith, a
junior, made the team.

Because of the loss of so many
established players, the team
placements are highly unsettled.

Stevens. Barnhill slapped a
team-leading 43 hits in averag-
ing .347 last year.

Joining him in the outfield
will be rightfielder Greg Sikes,
a power hitter, and either Bill
Todd or Larry Ruddell. Todd is
a freshman whose biggest asset
is speed, while Ruddell, a soph-
omore, is a steady performer.

Stevens is anticipating a bet-
ter record than last season’s
15-19 worksheet. and he realizes
the potential is there.

‘We started fast last year but
then slumped badly, and I don’t
think that slump will happen
this time. There is more experi-
ence on this team than I’v had
before, with most of the seniors
having played regularly since
they were freshmeti.”

doubles with an as yet unknown
partner, are sure of positions.

The remaining spots will be
filled Friday, when Davidson
meets the University of Eastern
Kentucky on the varsity courts
at 2 p.m. today.

Commenting on the non-Con-
ference schedule, Coach Harry
Fogleman stated that it is “‘a
very representative one,” with
Big 10 powers Purdue and Wis-
consin, Eastern heavyweights
such as Dartmouth and Har-
vard, and perennially strong
teams like Duke, Navy, and
Cincinnati.

Three of the teams on this
year’s schedule handed David-
son three of its five defeats last
year. These are Duke. Harvard,
and Navy.

Surveying his team's strength
and the difficult schedule, Fogle-
man said that he did not ex-
pect a repeat of last year’s rec-
ord of 19-5.

The Southern Conference will
also be a stiff test for the Wild-
cats this year. Strengthened by
scholarship players, Furman and
William & Mary should pose a
serious threat to Davidson’s ten-
uis supremacy in the Confer-
ence. Davidson has won the title
six out of the las. seven years.

Recently Fogleman received
the United States Lawn Tennis
Association's National Tennis
Education Award of Merit for
his outstanding work in promot-
ing tennis in the United States.

This is the highest award the
U.S.L.T.A. gives to college
coaches and club pros, and Fo-
gleman is the first Davidson
coach to receive it.

Fogleman is looking for his
400th win this season, having
already acquired 386.
