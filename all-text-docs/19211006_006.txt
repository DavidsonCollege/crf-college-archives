JAMES ERNEST THACKER

Among the clergymen who have grad-
uated at Davidson there is none better
known than Dr. James Ernest Thacker,
‘90. Dr. Thacker was born at Columbia,
Mo., on December 14, 1869. He took his
A.B. degree at Davidson, graduating with
the class of 1890. He then went to
Union Seminary in Richmond,  Va.,
where he graduated in 1893. In March,
1894, he married Miss Addie May Dixon,
of New York. Miss Dixon is the sister of
Thomas Dixon, the famous novelist. Dr
Thacker was ordained to the Presbyte-
rian ministry in 1893. His first pastor-
ate was in Oxford, N. C., which pastor-
ate he held from 1892-96. Then he held
for one year a pastorate in Louisville,
Ky., from which place he went in 1897
to the Second Church of Alexandria, Va.
In 1900 he. went to the Second Church
of Norfolk, Va. He held this pastorate
until 1909, when he was chosen Assem-
bly Evangelist of the Presbyterian
Church in the United States.

Dr. Thacker has just begun evangelis-
tic services in the First Presbytérian
Church of Charlotte.

He is a man of pleasing personality
and a forcible speaker. He has held suc-
cessful meetings in practically every
Southern State. The series of meetings
in Charlotte will close Sunday night, Oc-
tober 16th.

MILITARY HAPPENINGS

Four hundred and fifty men of the
Fifty-first Artillery, with eight six inch
rifles, eight eight inch howitzers, 40 trac-
tors, and 30 trucks, under the command
of Major McCaskie, encamped at David-
son last Wednesday night.

Early Wednesday afternoon a warlike
rumbling that loudened into a mighty
roaring took possession of the town as
big caterpillar tractors pulled into town
dragging their long barreled dogs of
war. Guns and tractors were pulled to
the campus side of Main street and were
strung out practically throughout the
full length of the town. The officers’
quarters, repair truck, and two rolling
kitchens were parked in the grove op-
posite the post office as this was the
most centrally located point in the line.

As soon as they had gotten supper
most of the men went to work to wash
as much road dust off as possible with
a basin full of water. Others in the
mechanics’ section spent some time re-
pairing their machines, while quite a
number sought the movies, pool room,
and other places of amusement which
our city does not possess. Davidson’s
Main street gave the appearance of a
very large city with soldiers, students,
and spectators, all trying to get around
at the same‘time. After satisfying their
curiosity the soldiers retired to make
their bunks beneath the tarpaulins that
covered their guns.

Among the six inch rifles was one
used in France which is said to have
fired more shots than: any other gun
manned by Americans. She is known as
“Dixie Girl,” and her record is around
1,400 shots. The Fifty-first saw service
in France and has a splendid record.

Late Thursday morning a visitor to

-| Davidson would never have guessed that

a regiment of. artillery had stopped in
the town. For these men upheld two
traditions of the American soldier. They
behaved as gentlemen while here, and

than they found it.

Hugh Orrell, of Knoxville, Tenn, a
member of the advance guard of the
Firty-first Artillery, now moving from|;
Camp Jackson, S. C., to Camp Eustis,
Va., was accidentally killed here last
Wednesday afternoon when he and an-
other soldier were caught between two
heavy army trucks. :

The detachment had halted here for
the noon-day rest, and when the order
to resume the march. was given the
driver of one of the trucks, instead of
moving forward, threw the gears of his
machine into reverse and moved unex-

pectedly backward upon the truck in

they left their camping ground cleaner,

his rear. Orrell and his companion were
standing between the two trucks. The
second man, whose name could not be
learned, was only slightly injured.

In the next few weeks sponsors will
be elected by the battalion and each of
the companies of the R. O. T. C. These
sponsors are to be selected from the
young ladies of the town and are to be
present at each special parade or cere-
mony. On each battalion function day
they are to come to the parade ground
in cars decorated with the company col-
ors. Each company is to decorate the
car in which their sponsor rides, and it
is proposed to make this decoration
competitive. This plan has been inau-
gurated at all of the larger R. O. T. C.
units, including Georgia Tech. and Au-
burn, and has been proven to be a very
helpful addition to the life and interest
of the unit.

Capt. Julian H. George, the new addi-
tion to the local unit of the R. O. T. C,
is a graduate of the University of Vir-
ginia, He saw service with the Eighth
Division in France, where he was seri-
ously wounded, Having, by this time,
fully recovered from his injuries, he has
been appointed to the Davidson unit.

The volunteer squad of guards at the
recent P. C. game rendered very efficient
service in keeping the side lines clear.
The squad was under the command of
Lieutenant Cooper and consisted of 15
men,

cA LIBRARY NEWS.

To those who appreciate the value of
standard literature, the Library has some
very pleasing irfformation to give. The
Library has recently made several, very
important additions to its shelves, one
being the “Social Problems of Porto
Rico,” by Dr. Fleagle.

Dr. Fleagle’s book is a very interesting
discourse on the social problems of
Porto Rico, emphasis being placed on
those of the rural districts. Dr. Fleagle,
formerly dean of the University of Porto
Rico, now a member of our faculty, first
published this book in. 1917, after being
a resident of the country 10 years. This
fact makes it very valuable as a source
of information as well as of pleasure.

The other acquisition is the library of
Mr. Richard N. Tiddy, donated through
the generosiay of Miss Sarah Tiddy,: of
Charlotte. These books, which are now
being unpacked, will add materially to
the Library.

RECORD OF MATRICULATION
BROKEN AGAIN THIS FALL

Davidson has again broken her matri-
culation record. For the past few years
she has been doing this each September,
but never before has the enrollment
reached the number of 508. This, of
course includes the two co-eds who are
attending Davidson this fall. A few
men have found. it necessary to with-
draw, as is always the case.

The accomodating of over 500 students
has been made possible by the generous
way in which many old men have agreed
to take in a third room mate. “As soon
as the new dormitory is erected this will
no longer be necessary.

Five hundred is said to be the ideal
size for a-college student body. It is
large enough, to participate in all the
inter-collegiate athletics, yet not too
large to prevent the students from know-
ing each other and making of them-

selves'a big group of.real*friends, ___|—-
