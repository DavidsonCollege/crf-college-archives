Another Frank Ramsey?

Coach Lefty Driesell may have another Frank Ram-
sey headed this way next year. Ramsey, for the benefit
of those who don’t follow pro basketball very close, is
a =" the Boston Celtics, perennial powerhouse of
the "

Although Ramsey is not a starter (the Celts have a
pretty good backcourt combination in Bob Cousy and Bill
Sharman), he is noted for his ability to come off the
bench and pour in some quick ets. Some Celtic
fans describe Ramsey as the “point a minute man,” and
many contend he could keep up his pace if playing full
time.

Anyway, to relate the possibility of a basketball
player similar to Ramsey coming to Davidson next year,
it was learned this week that Barry Teague, 6-1 guard
from Madisonville, Ky., and one of Driesell’s prize
catches, had received the Frank Ramsey Award in his
school this year.

The award amounts to a most valuable player award,
and it honors Ramsey, who once starred for Madisonville
High and later the University of Kentucky. _

Teague is described as a hustler with quick hands,
and the experts up that way claim that he was “perhaps
the best defensive guard in -the state this past season.”
And that’s saying a lot when you consider that Kentucky
has as many good basketball players as it does fast horses.

We saw Teague in a pick-up game down at the gym
when he was visiting the school one week-end, and
lieve us, he’s not all defense — that fellow can shoot a
basketball too, and from about 35 feet. (in other words
way out.)

But if you think Driesell is happy about Teague com-
ing here, consider how Tom Stevens feels. Last week,
Teague hurled the second no-hitter of his high madi
career. It seems he struck out the first nine men he faced
and 16 in all.

That’s right, baseball fans, we got a pitcher coming
here!

Thanks, Men

While passing out orchids to Bill Dole and his foot-
ball players last week, we left out three very important
men who contributed very much to the promising spring
drills.

The three men are all high school football coaches,
who consented to give Dole their time and effort this
spring, when Dole’s regular assistants are ‘so involved in
other sports. The men are Dave Harris of Harding
in Charlotte, Joe FopP of Mooresville High, and Don
Hipps of Garinger High in Charlotte.

These three aided Dole tremendously in his effort to
pick the ’Cats up where they left off in the fall, and we
truly believe that Harris, eee Hipps were instru-
mental in cooking up some 0 excellent spirit obvious
in the Wildcat ms and the Red-White game.

When spring drills opened, Dole comically comment-
ed to his sieges when introducing the new faces, “I've
been tryin to get Harris over here as an assistant for
years, but he says he can’t afford to take the pay cut.

So we extend a hearteous thanks and an invitation
to return to these three gentlemen, whose hours of hard
work and sweat may pay off next fall, when they return
as spectators to wah te new-look Wildcats roll over

some bigger foes.

Linksters To Match
Wake Forest Tuesday

By GEORGE PEPPER
Davidsonian Sports Writer

The Davidson College golf will meet the Dea-
cons of Wake Forest in Ton Tuesday afternoon

in a match that is primarily scheduled to give the ’Cats
experience with top-rate competition.

Last Friday the Deacons post-
ed a 19-2 victory over the Dav- T
idson linksters. Coach Tom Netters Look 0

sults this time, and explains, “A

but the experience will be in-
valuable.”

FALL TO FURMAN

The Keydets, sporting four
southpaw hurlers on their
pitching staff, are rated by
Davidson Coach Tom Stevens as
“a good team, not on top, but
not on the bottom either.”

VMI, a team the ‘Cats did
mot face late season, are

spearheaded by All-Confer-
ence pitcher Joe Gedro, a
smooth lefty who chalked up
four of the Keydets’ six wins
last year, including a win
over conference champion
Citadel. ‘

In addition to his pitching
capabilities, Gedro roams the
outfield in excellent style and
batted a respectable .375 last
season, ninth best in the con-
ference.

Other top performers oppos-
ing the 'Cats tomorrow include
second baseman Weldon Edding
and shortstop Kenny Reeder,
whoform one of the league's bet-
ter double play combinations.

Tuesday and Wednesday of
next week, the locals enter-
tain The Citadel in a two day
effeir. Last year the two
teams split a doubleheader
here, Davidson teking the
first, 8.7, and The Citedel the
second, 14-8.

As of Wednesday, they were
the only remaining undefeated
team in the league, as last
week’s unbeatens fell to various
teams on Thursday prior to the
weekend, and this past Monday
and Wednesday.

If play was a little ragged this
week, everyone had plenty of
reasons for explanation. After
frolicking all weekend and giv-
ing a pint of blood on Monday
and Tuesday, I-F’ers just were-
n't up to par.

Monday's results were as fol-
lows:

The SAE’s knocked the Sig-

ranks; the KA’s clipped the Pi

lasted the Phi Delts, 14-13, as
the losers left the winning run

beat the Pikas, 14-8; and the

ents, 9-5.

ten teams siushed their way to
the fields, and something re-
sembling a rhinoceros party en-

ticularly amusing, and no one
found the art of sliding a diffi-
cult thing.

ently the effects of a rigorous

as an earlier 14-13 ’Cat victory
was reversed to a 14-13 win for

TOURNAMENT

On May 89 the team will
go to Richmond for the South-

which Stanley was last year’s

this week with three successive
nilatches on Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday.

On Monday, only Andy Sher-

Virginia team, 8-1.

The next day, the Wildcats
redeemed themselves with a re-
sounding triumph over Rich-
mond, 9-0.

The final match of the tour
found the ’Cats in Williams-
burg, where they were upset
by William and Mary, 6-3. Once
again Sherrill won his singles
match, making him three for
three on the trip, while Rich-

Do

wings?

\Decidedly not. In fact most executive jobs are on

ithe ground. Of course, all officers may apply for pilot

jand navigator training if they meet the eligibility
requirements. There will always be a need for piloted
aircraft. And it is foreseeable that in your working
lifetime, there will be piloted spacecraft—piloted and
navigated by Air Force officers.

_ But right now, there is also a big future for college-
trained Air Force officers on the ground. New and
exciting technical jobs are opening up. Important ad-
ministrative positions must be filled as World War II
officers move into retirement.

How can you~a college student—become an Air
Force officer? First, there's Air Force ROTC. Then’
for college graduates, men and women in certain
fields, there is Officer Training School. The graduate
of its three-month course wins a commission as a sec¢
ond lieutenant. Other ways are the Navigator Train4
jing program, and the Air Force Academy.

Some benefits that go with being an Air Force
Officer. Starting salary plus allowances compare
jwith the average in equivalent civilian jobs. Then
there's free medical and dental care, thirty-day vaca-
tion, the chance to win graduate degrees at Air
Force expense, and liberal retirement provisions,

No, Air Force officers do not need wings to move}
up. There's plenty doing on the ground. Perhaps you
could be one of these young executives in blue. Ask!
your local Air Force Recruiter. Or write, Officer,
(Career Information, Dept. SC13, Box 7608,,
Washington 4, D.C., if you want further infor-'
mation about the navigator training or Officer}

programs.
