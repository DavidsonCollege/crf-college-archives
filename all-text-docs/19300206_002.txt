THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 6, 1930

Sixth Annual Oratorical
Contest on Constitution
To Be Held on June 19

Selection of Winner Will Be Made
at Los Angeles

CHANGES MADE IN RULES
Orators Have Choice of~Any, of

Fourteen Subjects—All College
Students Enigible

The Better America Federation of ‘Cali-
fornia is holding its sixth National Inter-
collegiate Oratorical Contest on the “Con-
stitution” this year. The finals of this con-
test will be held at Los Angeles on June the
nineteenth,

Several changes have been made in the
rules of the contest since last year. The
former time limit of ten minutes has been
changed to a word limit of fifteen hundred
words. This will. permit the speakers to
speak as slowly as they wish and will thus
allow them to improve the delivery of their
speeches. The old ten minute limit caused
many of the orators to rush, in order to get
in all they wished to say and still remain
within the limit. This made it unfair for the
speakers who spoke slowly. These reasons
caused the directors of the contest to make
the new rule. Under this rule all the con- |
testants are permitted to give the same
length speech no matter how slow or how
fast they may speak.

Although the total amount of the prizes
remain the same, the amount of the lowest
prize has been raised from three hundred and
fifty dollars to four hundred dollars. The
first prize, howeWer, remains at fifteen hun-
dred dollars. This change in the amount of
the prizes should stimulate more interest
in the contest.

In addition to the above changes there |
has also been a new selection of subjects |
made, These subjects are more in keeping |
with the maturity of college men and women |
than the old ones were. The subjects for |
1930 are:

Davidson Fresh Defeat
Quintet F rom Belmont

| Pierce Scores Eleven Points and
| Intercepts Many Passes for
Wildkittens

| Last Thursday night the Davidson Wild-
| kittens overcome the Belmont Abbey team
to win their-fourth straight game of the sea-
son, 20-14. The game was featured by the
| fast playing of both teams both offensively
and defensively, Both teams committed many
fouls but no one was put out of the game
on four personal fouls.

The high scorer of the game was “Skinny”

Pierce with eleven of the Wildkittens‘ twenty
points. He was closely followed by Diamond
of Belmont Abbey and Allen Rogers with
ten and seven points respectively; Besides
being the high scorer of the night Pierce was
probably the star for Davidson. He inter-
cepted many ‘passes from the Belmont Abbey
men and dribbled down the court and shot
the hasket for two points. Early in the game
he wrenched his knee but he stayed in the
game and played a brillant game. Starring
with him was Allen Rogers, the diminutive
forward of the Wildkittens, who shot seven
points for the Freshmen and was very fast
| on the floor especially on the offense.
No individual star could be picked from
|the Belmont Abbey team, they all played
well, both on the defense and on the offense.
They showed that that they have a team
that will give any Freshman team in the
South a good batle. The strong Freshman
team showed the fans that they are going to
be strong contenders for the state crown.

The line-ups of the two teams are as fol-
lows: ‘

Chapel Devotionals

Pastor of Hawthorne Lane Church,
Charlotte, Takes Text From
Ecclesiastes

Wednesday morning, January 29, Rev. R.
|S. Truesdale, D.D., pastor of the Haw-
'thorne Lane Methodist Church of Charlotte,
/conducted the devotional exercises during
the chapel period. He selected as a basis for
| his talk a part of the ninth chapter of Ec-
clesiastes, which reads: “All things come
alike to all, there is one event to the right-
| eous, and to wicked; to the good and to the
clean, and to him that sacrificeth, and to
| him that sacrificeth not; for to him that is
| joined to all the living there is hope; for
ja living dog is better than a dead lion.” Fol-

|
| lowing is the essence of Doctor Truesdale’s

| talk:
|

| .
| Pay too much for our lives. A man may pay

too much for his money and for his fame,
and maybe’ sometimes for’ his life. A man
who lives righteously while he can live may
be a good example for all men who will
follow in the right path. Sometimes we
recognize a great man’s worth after he is
dead, and more so after he is dead than
when he is living. ‘

Yesterday the natural course of tele-

nation’s frontiers, building new lines and
adding new subscribers.

Today finds many new ‘‘frontiers’’ for
telephone expansion — among them the
homes of present subscribers. Upstairs
