GOLF CLUB OFFICERS
AND IVS PLANS

A few days ago the golf club held its
regular quarterly meeting. Since. it) wats
the first meeting of the new vear, officers
were elected, as follows: President, Dr.
Arbuckle; Vice-President, Mrs. Worth;
Secretary, Professor Currie: and ‘Vreas
urer, Di, Moore McConnell.

1 Several important matters were taken
fup at this meeting, among which was
that concerning membership fees for
college students. It was at first consid-
ered best to allew the college students
to pav $5 a session for full privileges of
the club, but an account of the compli-
cations caused by this svstem, the follow
ing plan was adopted: Cards will be

issued to men hecoming members, and
the fee will be $5 for one vear. “Uhe
membership would begin at the time fee
is paid and continue until the same time
next year,

At the formal opening of the two new
holes on the course there will be a social
mecting of the club members, and also
it is expected that there will be an ex-
hibition game by some fine plavers from
Charlotte. “Vhis opening will take place
about the first week in April. This
spring the whole course will be seeded
in Bermuda grass. Vhe tournament
that was to have came off before Christ-
mas was postponed until the first part of
May on account of bad weather.
