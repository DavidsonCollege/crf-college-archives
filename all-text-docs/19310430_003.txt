Most credit should be given to the Dav-

time the Carolina intercollegiate golf
championship. This aggressive team, com-

In the state tennis tournament, David-
son's representative acquitted themselves
nobly, but were unable to cope with Car-
olina’s team of champions, and only two
men, MeLean and Dubose, were able to
reach the quarter-finals. The singles fi-
nals will bring together Bryan Grant, clay
court champion, and Wilmer Hines, junior
championship, both of Carolina.

Although V. M. I. brought one of the
south’s strongest track teams to David-
son last Saturday, the Wildcat track men
performed brilliantly, and the match end-
ed in a 63-all tie. Fleagle took his usual
first in the 100 and 220 dashes, while
George placed first in the 120-yard high
and 220 low hurdles, and second in the
100-yard dash, garnering 11 points to tie
with Smith of V. M. I. for high score.

Both Fleagle and George seem to. be

Davidson’s most consistent winners, and

V.M. I. Track Team Tries
Hard and Ties Davidson
In Exciting Meet 63-63

George and Smith Tie for High
Score With 11 Points Each

The V. M. L. track team fought the Da-
vidson Wildcats to a 63-63 tie here last Sat-
urday afternoon, April 25, in their dual meet.
The Cadets overran Davidson's early lead to
tie the score with a strong finish. It was
the exceptional strength of V. M. I. in the
middle and long distance events that brought
the match to a tie, after the wins in the
weights and dashes had given the ‘Cats what
seemed to be a safe lead.

Grimy George was Davidson's high point
man, having taken first place in the 120 high
and’ 220 low hurdles and third in the 100-
yard dash, Fleagle also grabbed oq two first
places by leading in the 100 and 220-yard
dashes.

Today the ’Cats play Clemson at Clem-

press, games have been played with South

the warm climate of South Carolina will
loosen up some of the old soup-bones and
boost some of the old batting averages.
