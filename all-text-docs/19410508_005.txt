Beatitudes.

Dr. J. W. Jackson, pastor of the

first Presbyterian Church of Co-
lumbia, South Carolina, was the
speaker at Vespers’ -last Sunday

night. His sermon was preceded by
the singing of “Rosary” by Mrs. Ar-
thur Rohr.
Dr. Jackson took for his text a

5 :10-16. figures
“Ye are the salt of the earth” and
“Ye are the light of the world” and
enlarged them.

CHRIST IS PRESERVER.
He said that salt is a preservation,
and also must be present in a man’s
blood. Similarty, Christ is the pres-
