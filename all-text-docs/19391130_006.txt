BIG BUSINESS

Big business has at last invaded |

the realm of college party-throw-

ing. A University of Detroit student |
has organized ‘Parties, Inc.’—and |
the new firm will guarantee the |

success of any social function from |
a hayride to a wedding.
But the company—-wisely—will |
have nothing to do with your es- |
cort for the evening. You'll have |
to take care of that little matter
without the firm’s expert advice!
