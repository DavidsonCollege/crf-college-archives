Wildcat basemen drop eight

“There is not much to say
when you are 1-8,’’ com-
mented Coach Palmer Muench
about the doubleheader losses
to Marietta College and Slip-
pery Rock State this past
weekend.

Later, Coach Muench went
on to account for the team’s
record as basically a failure to
coordinate hitting and pitch-
ing. One day the pitching will
be strong and the hitting
weak, and the next day it will
be the exact opposite.

In the first game of a
doubleheader against Marietta
College, a team that was
second in NCAA Division II
playoffs last year, it appeared
that in the early innings the
pitching and hitting were well-
coordinated.

Starting Pitcher Tim Barr
held Marietta to one run in

three innings, and his team- -

mates staked him to a 5-1
lead, as a result of scoring four-
runs in the second inning.

In the fourth inning the roof
caved in on Barr, as he allowed
a grand slam in an inning in
which six Marietta runners
crossed the plate. Marietta
went on to win the game 9-5.

Disaster struck early in the
second game as Davidson’s
pitching ace Joel Tew was
roughed up for four runs in the
first inning. Davidson’s hit-
ters could only produce one
run in seven innings and
Marietta won the game 6-1.

The Cats took the field
under cold and soggy condi-
tions on Monday, and for the
first time this season ‘‘they
gave away the games,” accor-
ding to Muench. Sloppy field-
ing nullified strong pitching
performances by Mike Hall
and Alan Alig, and cost the
Cats two games against Slip-
pery Rock College.

Sailors place second in opening race

By AMANDA HALL

The Davidson sailing team
opened its spring season by
placing second behind Old
Dominion University in the
15th Annual Webb Regatta
hosted by ODU in Norfolk,
Va., Saturday.

The team sailed against
Duke, N. C. State, ODU and
U. Va. Christopher Newport
College began the regatta but
dropped out after the second
race because they failed to
finish either race, according to
B-team crew, Stuart Camp-
bell.

Davidson’s A-team, Dave
Francis and Laurie Bingaman,
received the first place trophy
in their division. Francis and
Bingaman placed first in their
first race, and second in the
next two races,

Chuck Barrineau and
Campbell placed third behind
U. Va. and ODU in the
B-team races. The team cap-
sized in their first race, came

‘in first in the second race and
finished their last three races

fourth.

The wind on the course was
brisk and fluky, according to
Campbell, causing seven boats
to capsize during the regatta.
“In these races the important
factor was survival,’’ he said"

SAILERS HIKE OUT against a wind -Pete Goodman

The first race was held on

the Chesapeake Bay, but the’

rest were moved inland'to a
small river because the tide
went out.

“The course was so shallow
there we couldn’t sail with the

while preparing for Saturday’s re-

gatta.

board down,” said Campbell.
“I think they tried to schedule
the regatta when the tides
were high, but.SAISA (South-
ern Atlantic Intercollegiate
Sailing Association) changed
the dates.’

The regatta used ODU’s
boats, thirteen-year-old Pen-
guins. Unlike the Jets, the
boats Davidson uses, these
boats have only one sail.

“It’s like sailing bathtubs,”
said Campbell. ‘‘They tended
to dive under the waves like
real penguins. The only differ-
ence was that the boats went
down to stay down.”’

“But it wasn’t a bad re-
gatta, because you can’t really
blame a team for its boats,” he
concluded.

lack intra-team coordination

credit for Davidson’s only win
this season, a twelve inning
4-3 victory over Pfeiffer, pit-
ched well in the first game
against Slippery Rock.

After five innings the score
was deadlocked at two runs
apiece, but two errors by
Davidson fielders in the sixth
inning opened the gates and
allowed three runs to score,
and gave S. R. a 5-2 victory.

The second game Monday
saw the emergence of another
starting pitcher for the Cats.
Alan Alig, who had been used
as a relief pitcher prior to
Monday, started and pitched
almost the entire game.

“Alig only lacked the confi-
dence to bea solid pitcher,’’
said Muench, and on Monday
“‘Quasor’’ surely ‘received a
strong boost of confidence.
For the first six innings Alig
game up only two hits and no
runs, but unfortunately the
Wildcats could only manage
one hit and no runs.

In the seventh inning an
error and a wild pitch got Alig
into a jam from which he
couldn’t extricate himself and
Slippery Rock scored three
runs to win by the score 3-0.

Besides the strong pitching
performances of Alig and
Hall, Muench has been deli-
ghted with the consistent play
of second baseman Rick Blink-
horn, who leads the team in
hitting with a .429 average.

The Cats haven't played a
weak team yet, according to
Muench, and the schedule
doesn’t get any easier.

It could be a long season if
the pitching of Joel Tew and
Tim Barr, and the hitting of
the entire team doesn’t come
around. Coach Muench feels
that they will, and the. Wild-
cats will post some more wins.
