Disabled Students Discuss Unique Davidson Experiences
Solidarity Week Sponsors Forum to Promote Awareness & Understanding

By Alice Felmlee

Rising an hour before class,
Stephen dresses, gathers his books,
and heads off to beat the morning
rush in Chambers. He arrives just
in time to beat the professor into
the classroom.

Tired of studying and hoping
to enjoy the unusually warm air of
February, Marty makes a post of-
ficerun. His friends are busy so he
heads off on his own.

Certainly, going to class and
checking your mail are parts of
everyday life — the lives of
Stephen and Marty, too. Stephen
Faller has been affected by cere-
bral palsy since birth. Although he
can walk with braces, he depends
on his motorized wheelchair for
most of his daily transportation.
Marty McLeod is blind. Armed
with his cars and his cane which he
“uscs as a red flag” Marty has no
problem being independent.

Growing up with these dis-
abilities has given both students a
perspective on Davidson and life
which many of us may never expe-
rience. When Stephen and Marty
shared these perspectives as part
of Solidarity Week one thing be-
came apparent. Similarity. “A lot
of aspects of my life are a little
more complicated than yours, but
it’s still just day-to-day. It’s a life
just like anybody else’s life,” said
Stephen.

Sharing the platform with
Betsey Boshell, a senior who has
completed extensive research on
Americans with disabilities, the
two painted a picture of their lives
as Davidson students. Like the
other 1,500 Davidsonians, they
seck the complete college experi-
ence; unlike the rest of us, they
sometimes face discomforting at-
tiludces and unwanted assistance.

The attitudes they sense do

not come from turning heads,
Stares, or snide remarks; rather,
they appear in indirect ways. “A
lot of people take advantage of the
handicapped parking spaces on
campus because they know I’m

"It's always wonderful to have
help offered and to receive it;
but it's also wonderful to be
trusted to handle things on
your own.”

the only person who uses them.
It’s not as crucial for me because I

can walk but there are those dis-

abled people out there who will be
forced to go elsewhere when those
spaces are taken,” commented
Stephen. Certainly, we have all
scen cars without handicapped li-

cense plates or stickers parked in
handicap spaces.

Holding doors, carrying food
trays for others, and offering assis-
tance on an assignment is often
seen as being merely polite. For
handicapped people, however, this
over zealous willingness to help
can often be interpreted in another
way: “It’s always wonderful to
have help offered and to receive it;
butit’s also wonderful to be trusted
to handle things.on your own,”
explained Marty.

Stephen offered this advice
about knowing when to offer help.
“If it’s something an individual
needs help with they will ask. Sim-
ply, give help when needed but not
when you want to be helpful.”

Listening to lectures, writing
papers, and taking tests arc all parts
of Stephen’s and Marty’s lives
similar to other Davidson students;
yet for Marty study practices are a

Davidson Archaeoligical Program Prepares
for Another Summer Excavation in Cyprus

By Andrew Spainhour and
Alex Crumbley

Dr. Michael Toumazou,
Davidson professor of classics and
archacology, is already planning
another summer of archaeological
excavation and study on the Medi-
terrancan island of Cyprus. Now
in its fourth year, the project has
already met with considerable suc-
cess, withregard to both the educa-
tional experience which its partici-
pants have enjoyed and the discov-
erics that have been unearthed on
the site in Athienou, Cyprus.

Last summer, Six
Davidsonians excavated alongside
35 other students and archacolo-
gists from colleges and universi-
ties around the U.S. In addition to
receiving credit for Toumazou’s
field school CLA 342, Andrew
Spainhour, Stancel Riley, Sarah
Melson, Alex Crumbley, Joseph
Cooper, and Jason Bell traveled

extensively around Cyprus with |

the rest of the group, which in-
cluded several Davidson alumni
and Instructional Support Director
Diane Stirling. ;
The excavation in Athicnou, a
village near the Cypriot capital
Nicosia, sought primarily to un-

cover a number of
buildings and
tombs, dating
from the Archaic
period (6th cen-
tury B.C.) to the
Venetian period
(17th century
AD.).

In addition to
discovering sev-
eral structures and
a sanctuary be-
lieved to be de-
voted to Herakles,
a Venetian cem-
etery was un-
earthed, exposing
a large number of
skeletons. The
most exciting
finds included a
gold and onyx
ring, a gold neck-

lace, and several
statues. The finds are now housed
in the museum, located in Larnaca,
a coastal city to the south of
Athicnou. Toumazou hopes one

Donation

and foundation gifts is currently at °

$33 million since the gift from
First Union. Last year Davidson
raised $4.7 million from corpora-

tions and foundations. That broke .

the previous record of $4.1 mil-
lion.

Exactly how the $1.1 million
from First Union will be utilized at
the College has not yet been de-
cided, according to Bethea. In the
next couple of weeks Davidson
and First Union officials will sit
down and hope to come up with
concurrent ideas of how the money
-will be spent.

Having builtuponexperiences
of campaigning in regional areas
like Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill,
Greensboro, and Winston-Salem,
Davidson has gone into Charlotte
“very ready,” according to Bethea.
Charlotte is the midpoint of the
national campaign, and in the next
6 months Davidson hopes to raise
$9 million more in new commit-
ments,

After Charlotte the campaign
will move on to other cities such as
Washington D.C., Richmond, and
Atlanta.

mysterious and adventurous be-
cause of Indiana Jones and his es-
capades, senior Sarah Melson dis-
pels such myths. “It’s really hard
work,” she remarks, “‘but it’s a lot
of fun to learn about Cypriot cul-
ture, both in the present and in

ancient times.”

Dr. Toumazou is holding an
informational meeting this
Wednesday at 8:00 pm in Cham-
bers room 312 for students inter-
ested in working for the project

little different.

“T get to hear lectures twice
whether I want to or not,” he com-
mented. Using a braille machine
Marty transcribes all of his lec-
tures from tapes in order to have
them for later use. In addition, he
must also depend on cassette re-
corded textbooks, and even some-
timesaclassmate, or Dr. Marsicano ;
to read daily assignments to him as
well. To that Marty commented,
“I sometimes think these people
don’t know what they’re getting
themselves into.”

Closing their discussion
Stephen and Marty focused on one
main idea. “The main problem
begins when we become different.
The only way to stop this and af-
fect change is through being in-
formed.”

Boshell summed this up, “the
factthat many presently abled bod-
ies will become disabled in the
future and no one knows if it will
be them or possibly a loved one,
should at least be one selfish rea-
son to support the physically dis-
abled person’s right to equality.”

Recycling
Continued from page 1

when students went on school
breaks. In addition, students were
overwhelmed because they had to
organize recycling bins in other
parts of the campus, like the Union,
dorms, and houses.

With the new strategy, mem-
bers of the faculty and staff can
participate in the process; the work
will be shared and recycling will
be more successful. “The exciting
thing from my perspective,” Dr.
Martin said, “‘is not that the policy
is here but that we can make the
policy a part of everyday life.”
Currently some items, like colored
paper and colored bottles, are not
included in the recycling. The
system will incorporate these items
once everyone first becomes ac-
customed to recycling the basics.
Recycling in Chambers will take a
little adjustment but should even-
tually save time and will, in the
long run, benefit all.
