Delts Top IMAC Track

Scoring points in every event but the discus throw, the Phi Delts turned the
IMAC track and field meet into a runaway to repeat as cinder champions of Patter-
son Court this year, topping their nearest competition, the Phi Gams.

Coping firsts in the three-quar-
ter mile run (Terry O'Hair in
3:43.2) and the high jump (5' 9"
by Phil Squier), six second
places, four third places, and
three fourth place finishes, the
Delts smothered their nearest
competitors, the Phi Gams 41-20.

Outstanding individual of the
meet was Fiji freshmen Tommy
Caldwell, who won first in the
100 yd. dash with a 10.5 timing,
first in the 220 yd. dash with
a 2.1 and sparked the Gam
880-yard relay team to a 1:40
victory. Tom Newberry another
freshman heaved the shot 46°9

Conference Meel

VMI's Keydets jogged away
with their seventh conference
indoor track championship in
12 years Saturday on their

Purdue, where this year’s coach resigned, and to North
Carolina, where Dean Smith is on the hot seat. ;
Lefty says that he hasn’t been contacted officially
by officials of any of these schoob, but admits that
some alumni have talked to him in unofficial capacities.
Said Driesell recently, “Right now the only thing
I'm interested in doing is recruiting for Davidson. I'm
happy here and I've never applied for a job anywhere
else.”
Let's hope it stays thet way. If Lefty leaves, David-
son’s Cinderella carriage turns back into a pumpkin.

The Associated Press poll of sportswriters, the most
prestigious of the wire service polls, placed Davidson
as sixth in the country in the final balloting this week.
Ahead of the ’Cats are Michigan, UCLA, St. Joe, Provi-
dence, and Vanderbilt. Duke is tenth. ; _

UPI picked the Wildcats as seventh in their final
rankings, putting Brigham Young, which has lost five
times, ahead of Lefty’s twice-beaten charges.

Fred Hetzel’s inclusion on Look magazine’s ten-man
All-America team makes it a clean sweep for the Wild-
eats’ big one in the array of All-American squads.

Hetzel has won a first team position on all four
other major A-A teams, including those of the Associated
Press, United Press International, NBA coaches, and
Sporting News. ;

Joining him as unanimous choices on the concensus
All-American are Bill Bradley of Princeton, Cazzie Russell
of Michigan, and UCLA’s Gail Goodrich. ;

Dick Snyder joined Hetzel on Look’s District 3B
‘all-Star team. Other members are Larry Lakins of N. C.
State, Billy Cunningham of UNC, and Bob Leonard of

Wake.
Sports Editor Ronald Green of the Charlotte News
merits a vote of thanks from Davidson, as he was the
representative of District 3B on the selection committee.
Davidson's Tom Youngdale and Bobby Lane won
positions on the Greensboro Daily News’ ten-man All-
State Freshman team, which was led by Larry Miller of
UNC and Mike Lewis of Duke.
Other team members are Duke’s Warren Chapman
and Ron Wendelin, Grey Campbell of UNC, Bill Kretzer
and Bill Mavredes of N. C. State, and David Stroupe of

Wake.

s

My apologies to Southern Conference Commissioner
Lloyd Nondan for ever questioning the justification of
the conference tournament. West Virginia’s 14-15 season
record and 22-point massacre by Providence in the East-
ern Regionals’ first round substantiates without a doubt
his theory that the league’s method of determining a
champion produces a team that is “both season-strong
and tourney-strong.” ;

Irrelevant is the fact that the first team in the con-
ference has not gone to the NCAA tourney in three of the |
last five years and also irrelavent is the fact that in these
three years the Southern’s representative has lost its
first-round game by an average margin of 22 points,
including two losses to Ivy League teams.

There is no doubt that West Virginia was the con-
ference’s best team this year, that the single-elimination
tourney is the fairest, most logical, most practical way of
determining a champion and that it contributes im-
measurably to the Southern’s national prestige.

e e e

The Wildcat senior cagers’ match against Cunning-
ham’s team isn’t their only post-season cetivity. Except
for Briggs, they are all also playing this weekend for
Greenville Old Pros in the Southern Textile Basketball
Tournament in Greenville, S. C.

In addition, Hetzel was selected today for the
East-West Ali-Star game March 27. He scored 15 points
for the East in last year’s match at Lexington, Kentucky.

AND FOOTBALL, TOO

Football Coach Homer Smith reports that he has now
bagged five recruits for next year’s frosh squad.
Leading the list are Mike Thornton, a 6-10, 195
pound running back and linebacker from Jamestown,
and Sandy Brennan, a 6-2, 205 pound lineman from Mor-
anton.
6 Also deciding on Davidson's revamped football pro-
gram are Sam Gwyn, a 180-pound running back from
Leakesville who is a scholarship finalist here; Hal Shaw,
a quarterback from Greenville, S. C.; and Lewis Homer,
a 190 pound interior lineman from Clearwater, Fla. who
has played only one year of high school ball and who
Smith says may be a real “‘sleeper”.
The new grid mentor also reports that Stu Burness,
a 6-3, 215 pound junior who was on the varsity basketball
squad last year and suited out for the conference tourney
this year, will be out for football this spring, probably

as a tight end.

home oval in Lexington, Va.,
as Davidson’s squad, reduced
in number because of last-
minute iliness, limped in with
seven points to take seventh
place in the team standings.

The Keydets, who copped
first place in five events,
broke three records in scor-
ing 64 1/3 points.

For the Wildcats sprinter
Alan Turner took fourth place
in the 60-yard dash and in
the 60-yard low hurdles (a
new race in the conference
meet). Commented track coach
Heath Whittle. “The 60 (yard
dash) was won in 0:06.2, an ex-
ceptionally good time for this
season of the year. Our man.
Turner, however, is basically
not a 60-yard man: his specialty
is more in the 100 and 220
dashes."'

Whittle continued, ‘‘Tommy
Heffner did a good job for us
by running a 4:27 mile and
taking fourth place in that
event. Ronnie Reese did very
well in the 880: he nan a 1:58,
his best time, and took fifth
place.”

Fred Hetzel will lead a team of his senior cohorts and other Southern Confer-
ence players against Billy Cunningham, and the Big-Four All-Stars in the Charlotte

Coliseum at 8 p.m. on March 23.

“I'd like one more organized
game in Charlotte,” said Het-
zel. “A lot of people in Char-

This will give them another op-
portunity to see the Wildcats."

Davidson players Hetzel, Bar-
ry Teague, Charlie Marcon, and
Don Davidson will be featured
in the game. Terry Holland, as-
sistant basketball coach at Da-

Lefty Lands Honor:
Top SC Coach Again

By CHUCK BYRD
Davidsonian Sports Writer
Basketball coach Lefty Driesell tied former West
Virginia coach Fred Schaus’ record Tuesday when he
was named Southern Conference Coach-of-the-Year for

the third straight season.

But different from the last
two years, this year Driesell had
some close competition. It came
from Bill Chambers of William
and Mary who polled 16 votes
to Driesell’s 20.

Other coaches who received
votes were Howie Shannon of
VPI, with 6 votes; Lewis Mills
of Richmond. 3 votes; George
King of the newly-eliminated

a

ginia, with 2 votes; and Mel
Thompson of The Citadel, with
1.

“I'm real proud that. thé
sportswriters chose to give me
the award,"’. Driesell comment
ed, ‘“‘but it’s not just for my-
self. I feel that it was given to

the whole basketball program

' many important. decisions this

year, Coach Holland, and of

“Esmond Phelps has improv-

The team appears especially
strong in lower positions. Fogle-
man pointed out that the team
will be better than last year in
the fifth and sixth positions.

Doubles competition pairs
Schutt and Council on the num-
ber one team. Hurd and Phelps
form the second. Third position
in the doubles is to be taken by
either Parrott and. Mueller or

_ Meschan and Frank.

A stiff schedule faces the Fo-
glemen. They play 27 teams and
include competition at the Rol-
lins Tennis Week tournament in
Florida. Rollins is rated as one
of the better tennis schools. in
the country.

Two weeks from now, the ten-

y and a match against the University of
pt to improve on last year’s sparkling

nis team takes .on(two top Ivy
League schools, Amherst and
Williams. Soon after that, they
meet Columbia. /

These four teams accounted
for four of Davidson's six losses
last season along with Duke and
George Washington.

Other non-conference compe-
tition pits the ‘Cats against To-
ledo, runner-up in the Mid-Amer-

ican Conference last year.

They also face Kalamazoo Col-
lege which was ranked third
among small colleges Jast year
and is rated second only to
Michigan among that state’s
teams this year.

“We'll be able to say about
where we stand in the confer-
ence by the time we start Spring
Vacation.’ speculated Fogel-
man. “By then we will have
played three conference match-
es—The Citadel, Furman, and
George Washington.”

A pleased Fogelman pointed
out that the conference tourna-

In Conference Match

By NEVILLE PATTERSON
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Southern Conference wrestling season came to
a close this week with the conference tournament
held at VMI. Yo!

Davidson's Wildcats (22 pts.) took fifth place be-
hind third place VMI (42 pts.) and The Citadel (40
pts.). Furman and William and Mary were both un-
able to score and together shared the cellar.

As defending champion West Virginia came
through with enough second and third places to edge
out Virginia Tech for the best team total.

VPI took more individual first places than any-
one, but was unable to beat West Virginia's well bal-
anced squad, which piled up 74 points to VPI's 71.

In the 123 Ib. class, Joe Buffington was deci-
sioned by Charlie Check of West Virginia, but he
followed up his defeat to take third place behind
John Seymour of VPI and Check.

Mike Bisard, Wildcat captain, took third place
in his 130 Ib. class. He was pinned by Ned Jarrell
of VPI who took first place.

Terry O’Hair got a bye in the 157 lb. first round.
He then lost to Bob Callahan of VPI and beat VMI'’s
Van Vamais to take fourth place.

In the 167 lb. class, Eris Nichols beat Ennis
Marks of The Citadel, then beat Jack Jordon of VMI
in overtime before he was beaten by Biondollio of
West Virginia, Nichols came in third behind Dick
Jenkins of VPI and Biondollio.

Parker also noted, “Buffington did real well;
he lost only one match the whole season, including
the tournament. Eric Nichols was tremendous in the
tournament as well as throughout the year; so was
Jesse Sims.

“I can’t wait until next year.”

ISC Meet

Davidson's swimmers finish-
ed the 1964-65 season by plac-
ing fifth in the Southern Con-
fererice Swimming Meet at
Williamsburg last weekend, a
fourth-place finish only on the
final relay.

VMI, last year’s conference
champions, lived up to ex-
pectations by capturing first
place with 144 1/2 points to
set a new conference—meet
scoring record.

VPI's tankmen finished se-
cond with a total of 96 points.
the Citadel was third with 54
points, William & Mary rank-
ed fourth with 50, and West
Virginia followed way behind
Davidson’s 46 with a ¢otal of
2 points.

Top Catfish included Randy
Hughes, who qualified in both
the 200-and 400-yard individ-
ual medleys and swam a leg
of the freestyle relay, Jim
Stokes who qualified third in
the 100-:yard butterfly and fin-
ished third, and John Helm,
who qualified sixth and fin-
ished fourth in the same event.

John Alexander qualified in
the 100- and 200-yd. backstroke,
the 50-yard freestyle, and
swam the backstroke leg of the
medley.

Butch Falligant finished
fourth in the diving com-
petition. !

and we felt.it would be good to
have someone from the confer-
ence on our staff.”

Coach Charlie Parker, who!

coached Fagg as a wrestler, re-
called, ‘‘He was about the best
wrestling captain I have ever
had. He will make a big contri-
bution to the athletic program
as a coach, recruiter, and per-
sonality. He's a real hustler—a
ball of fire.”

Parker's oniy complaint is that
the former Carolina's A.A.U.
champion will not be helping
coach wrestling. Instead he will
replace former assistant Dwight
Shoe as swimming coach.

While at Davidson, Fagg was
in Omicron Delta Kappa,
Who's Who, “D” Club, the Bea-
ver Club, and the YMCA. He
served on the Honor Court and
as president of his fraternity,
Phi Gamma Delta.

After receiving a master’s de-
gree at Boston University, he
was assistant coach and head
wrestling coach at Garinger
High of Charlotte. He comes to
Davidson from The Citadel,
where he also served as foot-
ball assistant and head wres-
tling coach.

The High Point native is mar-
ried and has three young sons.
He is expected to arrive next
week to prepare for spring prac-
tice which begins April 6.

Homer Smith joked that, ‘I
don't know if I'd like to play
under him or not. I hear he’s
pretty tough."

A sophomore halfoack remark-
ed, “If Coach Smith has doubts
about playing under him, I
know he’s tough.”
