Student/trustee reception planned for this month

The SGA-sponsored Trustee Contact Committee plans a campus-wide stu-
dent/trustee reception on Thursday, Feb. 20, from 6-7 p.m. in Chambers Gal-
lery. Committee chairman Anil Sood said he hopes the reception will “give a
chance for the whole student body to meet the trustees and express their opin-
ions.” He said, “The purpose of this committee is to maintain a liason with the
trustees throughout the year.” Each of the 29 members of the Trustee Contact
Committee and each SGA officer corresponds with a trustee during the school
year to keep the board up-to-date on Davidson events.

Preservation Hall Jazz Band to perform

The Preservation Hall Jazz Band recreates the jazz of 50 years ago with a few
twists of its own in a performance at 8 p.m. tonight in Love Auditorium.

Musicians mostly in their 60s, 70s and 80s make up the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band, whose permanent home at 726 St. Peter St. in New Orleans draws
crowds each night to hear the mixture of marches, quadrilles, blues, spirituals
and ragtime that makes up jazz. Because the Preservation Hall musicians impro-
vise, each concert is an original and cannot be reconstructed exactly the same
way.

Band members performing at Davidson College are Thomas “Kid Thomas”
Valentine and Wendell Brunious on trumpet, Manuel Crusto on clarinet, Em-
manuel “Manny” Sayles on banjo and guitar, John Royen on piano, Frank Fields
on bass, Worthia G. Thomas on trombone and Alonzo Stewart on drums and
vocals.

Duke Endowment donates $725,000

The Duke Endowment has given Davidson $725 ,000 to be used for a profes-
sorship in international studies, faculty and staff support, language studies and
other programs, President John Kuykendall announced Monday Jan. 20.

The Duke Endowment gave $200,000 to Davidson as the third increment of
a $1 million commitment to establish the James B. Duke Professorship in Inter-
national Studies. The professorship will form a part of the new Dean Rusk Pro-
gram in International Studies.

The Endowment also gave $350,000 to be used for faculty and staff support,
$50,000 for a new college office of grants and contracts to assist faculty research
efforts, $40,000 for the college’s language laboratory, $20,000 for experimen-
tal theatre, $20,000 for the college’s sesquicentennial celebration in 1987 and
$45,000 for other programs.

Grants totaling $525,000 came in late 1985 in addition to the Duke Endow-
ment’s annual appropriation to Davidson, which totaled $1,057,000 in the
1984-85 year. The Endowment has given a total of $28,461,715 to Davidson
since the perpetual trust was created in the 1920s.

“The relationship between the Duke Endowment and Davidson College goes
back to the very beginning of the Endowment in 1924,” said Elizabeth Locke,
Ph.D., director of the Endowment’s Education Division. “Davidson was one of
only four educational institutions in the Carolinas designated by James B. Duke
to receive an annual appropriation. In addition to that appropriation, however,
the Endowment makes supplementary year-end grants, like the current one, as
funds are available. We know that the Davidson administration worked dili-
gently to select, from the many needs of the college, those priority items which
would make the most difference in improving teaching and learning at David-
son. We’re pleased that we can support these essential efforts.”

Founded in 1924 by North Carolina industrialist James Buchanan Duke, the
Duke Endowment is one of the nation’s largest private foundations. Its assets
total over $550 million. The Endowment provides assistance to non-profit hos-

pitals and child-care institutions in North and South Carolina; to rural United
Methodist churches and retired ministers in North Carolina; and to Davidson
College and Duke, Furman and Johnson C. Smith universities.

In 1984, the Endowment made grants of over $38 million. Awards since
1924 total nearly $686 million.
