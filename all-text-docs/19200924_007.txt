Interesting Facts Concerning David-
son’s Highest Commissioned
Officer.

Stephenson Dodson Ramseur, the
second child of Jacob A. and Lucy
M. Ramseur, was born at Lincoln-
ton, the 3lst day of May, 1837. His
parents were members of the Pres-

_ byterian Church and gave him the
best advantages of social and incel-
jectual improvement, without his he-
ing exposed to the “devises and
snares of the outer world.” His
mother was a woman beautiful and
attractive and of great force of
character.

He received his preparatory train-
ing in Lincolnton and Milton.
Thence he matriculated at David-
son College in 1853. He entered the
Freshman class and passed 18
months at this institution. He had
an ardent longing for a military ca-
reer, and though disappointed in his
first efforts to secure an appoint-
ment to West Point, he was not
downcast. Through the aid of Gen.
D. H. Hill, then a professor at Da-
vidson College, his second applica-
tion was successful. So he remain-
ed at Davidson until the end of his
Soph year, and entered West Point

- in 1855.

Soon aftef graduation he was
commissioned second lieutenant ia
the Infantry. In less than a year
the Civil War had begun, Ramseur
had tendered his sword to the gov-
ernment of the Confederacy, then at
Montgomery. His first charge was
to form a battery of artillery at Ral-
eigh, N. C. After forming, equip,
ping and training this unit, he pro-
ceeded to Smithfield, Va., in the
summer of 1861. After fighting in
this vicinity against McClellan, he
was ordered to Yorktown. Here he
was promoted to the rank of major.
Soon afterward he was elected col-
onel of the Forty-ninth Regiment of
Infantry, and had to leave his old
battery. He was wounded shortly
in “the seven days’ fight,” but re-
fused to leave the field. While
wounded he was made_ brigadier-
general and given a brigade in the
army of Northern Virginia. While

. THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 24, 1920.

in command of this unit he made his
famous charge at Chancellorsville.

But his greatest service was ren-
dered at the great battle of Gettys-
burg, where time after time he led
his thin lines into that shower of
shell. General Lee said of the whole
‘affair: “But without unjust dis-
jcrimination, we may say that Gor-
don, Rodes and Ramseur were the
heroes of this bloody fray.”

At Winchester and again at Fish-
er’s Mill his heroism was shown. He
had now been promoted to major-
general. While at Mill Creek with
a scanty force, holding ‘back Sheri-
dan’s vast host, he was fatally
wounded and then captured. Gen-
eral Early said of the affair: “He
met the death,of a hero, and with
his fall, the last hope of saving the
day was lost. He was a soldier of
whom his State has reason to be
proud; he was brave, chivalrous and
capable.”

Ramseur’s last message was to
his wife:

the grave of them both is now a
monument on the one side of which
is engraved the Confederate flag and
names of principal battles in which
he fought: on the other the date of
his birth and of his death, with this
appropriate inscription: “A Good
Soldier of Jesus Christ.”

STUDENTS ENJOYED WAL-
LACE REID IN “EXCUSE MY
DUST.”

“Excuse our dust” if we raise too
much sand in describing the thrills
Wallace Reid as Toodles Walden. a
dare devil racing fiend, furnished the
students of Davidson College Satur-
day night.

allace is under pledge to his
wife to refrain from speeding but
circumstances alter cases and Fate
ruled that he should drive in the an-
nual automobile race from Los
Angeles to San Francisco. Wallace
hits a fast pace throughout and ends
with a smash-up that was planned
by a rival concern.

To make use of a much over-
worked but expressive: twentieth
century phrase “Wally” centainly
shakes a wicked ‘steering gear.

Not the least interesting and en-
tertaining part of the night’s per-
formance was the two piece or-
chestra comprising a piano and
drum and manned respectively by
Messrs. Houston, White and Fresh
Rhames. When it comes to extract-
ing a little jazz from aforesaid in-
struments this duo is right on hand
and prepared to deliver the goods.
In fact such ,vas the syncopated
tunes rendered \hat several students
are- said to have contracted St.
Vitus’s dance buf it is hoped that it
will not assumefepidemic form.

To sum up th whole affair in a
nut shell the e\ening’s entertain-«
ment was highly}successful; others
equally so are Moked forward to
with much pleasug: by all.
