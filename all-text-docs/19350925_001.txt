Worthy Students
Are Aided By NYA

Students Work in Many Different

Capacities

“The National Youth Administration
is already helping seventy men and will
be employing thirty or forty more by
next month,” said Professor I. K. Mlea-
gle, administrator of the $1170 a month
fund turned over to Davidson College |!
the Federal Government to help worthy
students secure an advanced education.

The $1170 a month allotment is hig
ured on the basis of 78 jobstat $15 a
month, but it is not necessarily admin
istered that way. It is left up to the
judgment of the committee, which con
sists of Prof. Fleagle, Dr. G. R. Vowles,
and Prof. H. E. Fulcher. Last year, a

total of 131 students were employed at
approximately $11 a month. This
the college has 120 applications and ex-
pects to help them all in some way.
However, it is no easy job to get on
the relief roll as an examination of the
requirements will show. Some of them
are: No NYA student may belong to any
social organization which increases his
college expenses; he may not incur ex-
penses by engaging in any campus activ-
ity other than those deemed by the col-
lege to be a part of its scholastic en-
deavor; he may not indulge in extray-
agances of any kind; he must keep up a
good scholastic average; he, and one of
must sign a statement say-

his parents,
ing that he cannot attend Davidson Col-
lege without NYA aid.
of the many given
year are: grading papers or doing cler-
ical work for the faculty, working in
jaboratories or the library, coaching pu-
pils who are behind, and helping out at
neighboring schools in Huntersville, Cor-
