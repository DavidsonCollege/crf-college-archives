Otts lecturer explores roots of Christianity

By JIM DILLON

Wayne Meeks, professor of
religion at Yale University, gave a
series of lectures on “The Origin
of Christianity: A New Look at an
Old Puzzle” as the 1986 Otts lec-
turer last Monday. \

In his morning lecture, “Jesus
and Other Messiahs,” Meeks
suggests that Jesus was in his own
time regarded merely as a prophet
rather than as.a messiah and gave
evidence from the Dead Sea
Scrolls supporting his idea. The
concept of Jesus as the messiah is,
according to Meeks, a notion that
came about after this period. — &

Meeks gave the example that
in his time Julius Caesar too was
regarded by many as a messiah
and stated that it is not until time
has passed that such a term can ap-
propriately be placed on an indi-
vidual.

In the afternoon lecture on
“Christianity and Other Cults,”

Meeks attempted to identify the
chief characteristics separating
Christianity from other sects of
Judaism, noting that Christianity
failed as a sect of Judaism and
quickly distinguished itself as an
entirely distinct religion in itself.

The purpose of a sect, accord-
ing to Meeks, was to “convert or
replace the tradition over which it

_ has defined itself.” Most cults dis-
appeared once reconciliation with
Judaism over such an issue oc-
curred, said Meeks. He-oted
“clear differences” aside from ob-
vious differences tn doctrine and
belief that distinguished Christ-
ianity as a distinct religion rather
than simply another cult, of
Judaism.

Christianity, he said, is not
based on a “single ethnic root in
the sense of common immigrant
heritage” whereas most other cults
were largely ethnic groups having
common problems with tradi-

tional religion.

Meeks further noted the lack
of tolerance on the part of Chris-
tians toward other cults. This into-
lerance, according to Meeks, the
Christians shared with traditional
Jewish. contemporaries and not
with any other cults.

Christians were also similar to
the Jews in their advanced system.
of trans-local organization, allow-
ing them to maintain communica-
tions across large areas, and this,
he said, Christians did even better
than the Jews. “There seems to be
nothing like Christian interhuman
organization just as there is.noth-
ing parallel to that mission itself,”
Meeks said.

Christianity was initially fun-
damentally different from the
Jewish faith in the sense that it was
a “philosophical school” which
placed many more demands on its
participants than a cult did, said
Meeks.”

Meeks noted in closing that it
is the duty of the Christian histo-
rian to search for truths in: what
can be learned of the past and that
much.can be learned of Christian-
ity in what it had in common and
what was unique about the reli-

Introductions of new faculty continue

By AARON LEVINE
William Coclett

One of the new. members of
the faculty this year is political
science professor William Coc-
lett. °

Graduating from Allegheny
College in Meadville, Pennsyl-
vania with a B.A. in political sci-
ence in 1972, and then earning his
M.A. and Ph.D. at the University
of Pittsburgh in 1978, Corlett has
gone on to an assistant professor-
ship at Bates College in Louis-
burg, Maine, where he has been
for the past five years.

Presently on a one year sab-
batical leave, Coclett has been
picked for a one-term stint at
Davidson for the fall term, teach-
ing two of Dr. Brian Shaw’s
courses.

Coclett has found Davidson to
be a very friendly town, ang
praises the student body as “well-
prepared and willing to participate
in class.” He warns that all liberal

and weaknesses and it is unfair to
compare one to another.

A Pennsylvania native, born
in Harrisburg, Coclett enjoys run-
ning — especially on the col-
lege’s cross country circuit —
biking, camping, and _ literary
,criticism.

Vikram Kumar

One of the new professors
with the economics Department is
Vikram Kumar. Kumar, working
on a graduate degree in economics
at Vanderbilt comes to Davidson
on a two year stint, having heard
from one of his professors that
Davidson needed a man of
Kumar’s background.

Kumar’s specialty is in inter-
national economics and interna-
tional development, and mac-
roeconomic trade development.
This term he is teaching an
Economics 101 section and a
course on International
Economics.

Kumar has high praise for

dents as “sterling” and the faculty
as “dynamic,” praising the “orien-
tation to research.” He feels that a
great deal has been done to make
him feel at home.

Holding strong opinions on
teaching, Kumar states “‘a teacher
can do all he wants, yet rises to the
level of student’s incompetence.”
Students and teachers have to
work together to meet the objec-
tives of the course: “Teachers
need to be vibrant thinkers, buf-
fers to the outside world for stu-
dents.”

Kumar maintains: “Open-
mindedness is the single most im-
portant criteria in the field of
learning.” ;

A native of Delbi, India,

“Kumar received his B.A. from the_

St. Stephens College of Delhi
University in 1980 and his M.A.
from the Delhi School of
Economics. Kumar loves to write
poetry, paint and listen to classical
music, jazz, and the “hard rock”

Floyd.

Bruce Gillingham
While filling in for biology

professor Verna Case, who is on

sabbatical, Bruce Gillingham has
found that Davidson students are
by and large “reasonably bright,
polite, and reasonably moti-
vated . . . although they are quite
happy to be lazy.”

Gillingham received his B.S.
in biology from Virginia Tech, a
M.S. in zoology from the Univer-'
sity of Montana and his Ph.D. in
biology from the University of II-
linois.

His admittedly small sampling
of students (less than 20) has also
left him with the impression that
Davidson’s are “pretty good stu-
dents.” He is looking for a career-
in teaching beyond his year here,
but thinks that in many ways his
short stay here “is better than a
permanent job in someplace I'd

rather not be.”
