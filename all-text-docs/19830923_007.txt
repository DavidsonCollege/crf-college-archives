fair shake in rock and roll. Often the
women were given a song and a band
and told to look pretty. Changes began
to occur in the sixties with Joan Baez
and Janis Joplin, but as musicians
females were fundamentally ignored.

As we entered the 1980s, groups
such as Blondie and the Go-Gos of-
fered some hope, but not a lot. The Go-
Gos showed that women could have a
rollicking good time playing simplistic
music accompanied by inane lyrics,
but this gave little creedence to women
rockers on the whole.

Enter to Bangles.

The Bangles are a new group that
have masterfully merged the mid-six-
ties sounds of the British invasion
groups (the Hollies, the Beatles, and
the Rolling Stones) and the L.A.
groups with strange chord changes and
phase shifting of progressive rock.

Their self-titled E.P. acts as a tri-
bute to the old groups as well as an ex-
cellent example for new.

The Bangles’ largest success is in
their tight harmonies reminiscent of

son dances about madly in sharp con-
trast to the steady, Lennon-like rhythm
guitar of Susanna Hoffs.

Drummer Debbi Peterson sounds a
lot like a male in the Mamas and the
Papas — like “I’m in Line.” The two
guitarists exchange licks combatantly
in the styles of Chuck Berry and Geo-
rge Harrison while Annette Zilinkas
plays tight throbbing bass.

as they are at recreating the charm of
the Beatles. “How Is the Air Up
There” has all the pessimism Keith
Richards could muster, plus uncom-
promising harmonies and a harmonica
that would make Jagger and the boys
wince.

With four incomparable singers
and talented musicians, the Bangles
have a lot going for them. Their only
fault is that they are unwilling to be-
come the gimmick of some money
hungry record company executive.
While the Go-Gos are content to have a
guitar solo that could be classified as
little more than a finger exercise, the
Bangles apparently hole themselves up
for some time perfecting their art. The
Bangles are so far from being the de-
vice of higher powers, in fact, that
their first record company, Faulty
Products, earned its name by folding
within weeks of the release of The
Bangles.

The most refreshing thing about
the Bangles is that women, who have
time and time again shown their talents
behind the lines as studio musicians,
have stepped into the spotlight not with

a vendetta but with.talent that could .

stand up to any man’s in their league.

The Sting

By MATT MORRIS

The Sting (1973) Directed by George
Roy Hill. Starring Paul Newman,
Robert Redford, Robert Shaw and
Charles Durning. Rating: **1/2

Without question, film director
George Roy Hill is talented. Movies
like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid, The Great Waldo Pepper, and
The World According to Garp will live
forever in my memory. Yet with The
Sting it appears that not only Hill, but
his two stars, Redford and Newman,
have taken a breather. The film is far
too leisurely paced, self-confident,
and hellishly overlong to be the classy
entertainment it might have been. The
script however, practically demands
the viewer’s attention throughout, and
The Sting is mild fun in its own
frivolty.

The plot concerns two hustlers and
their attempts to “sting” (i.e., swindle)
a gangland mobster during the Depres-
sion. Robert Redford is his usual pre-
cocious self and Paul Newman grins a
lot. Robert Shaw is the real show,
hawever.. doing. his best Errol. Flynn
imitation as the slimy bad guy. As
usual with George Hill movies, the at-
mosphere seems uncanningly realistic
(albeit slightly claustrophobic) and en-
tirely convincing. Once he has set up
the board however, Hill is happy to
play with pawns.

The Sting won loads of awards
(even an Oscar) and made tons of
money. Amid all its calculated enter-
tainment is a real charisma — but all
things considered, I think it was the au-
dience that got stung.
