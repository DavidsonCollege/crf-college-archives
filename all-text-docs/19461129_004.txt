flow by gravity back to the central
unit, the fraternity court is lower.
This necessitated the installation
of a small pump to return the water
to the boilers. Any previously un-
explainable “moans and groans”
from this area are hereby account-
ed for.

It is hoped that all men have
grasped the significance of these
facts and, on the basis of an
enlightened understanding, bless

ment in our midst, or is he merely
a con-man, an insignificant in the
organization? This is, of course,
unknown, siftce both Judge Archer
and the director of D. B: I. refused
to make further comment. How-
man is but a small operator in the
most treacherous and deadly fifth
ever, my conjective is that this
column in the history of Davidson.
Momentarily we upperclassmen
may expect to hear of the destruc-
tion of this gang as the work of
the D. B. I. renews its culmination.

Judge Archer asks, however, that

rather than curse their silent senti- |

|of Sigma Upsilon.

upperclassmen be especially dili-
gent in turning in offenders dur-
ing this time of crisis in the hope
that-the leader of the plotters may

be apprehended on some minor
charge.

arrange matches with Duke and
U.N. C., the Cats might have an-
nexed the Southern Conference
crown. In bowling over N. C.
State, Clemson, U. S. C., and Fur-

ognized in Dixie net circles.

On the next play, substitute full-
back Dick Sparks blasted through
right guard and plowed 19 yards
for a score. Henderson again con-
verted to give the Citadel a com-
manding 8 point lead with only a

few minutes remaining.

Jake Wade engineered a despe-
rate march in the waning moments
of the fray, but the luckless Cats
once again bogged down on the

20 yard stripe. The Citadel then
ran four time-consuming plays as
the game ended moments later.
