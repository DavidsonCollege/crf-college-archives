DEBATING TEAM

VICTORIOUS ON
QUUTHERN TOUR

Sugg And Stutts Meet Georgia
Tech, Emory, Miami, And
Charleston Debating Teams

SUPPORT AFFIRMATIVE

James Salango And Tyler Port
Leave Tomorrow On West-
ern Tour

With the return of the team from the
Sunny South last Saturday night, Da-
vidson found itself ranking high in an-
other field—debating.

Coach C. K. Brown's proteges dis-
played exeeptional ability in the art of
oratory, making an excellent showing at
each of their four debates in an eleven-
day trip which began February 27.

The Davidson team, composed of Har-
old Sugg, Albert Stutts, and Alternate
‘Warner DuBose argued the affirmative
side of the query: “Resolved, That the
Nations Should Agree to Prevent the

International Shipment of Arms and
Munitions.”

Their first encounter was with the
College of Charleston on ‘Thursday

night, February 28. This was the most
disappointing of all the contests due to
an unfavorable decision by an audience
composed mainly of members of the
classes of the debating professor. many
of whom were so unfortunate as to hear
only the last rebuttal speeches.

Even though the local debaters lost,
the Charleston team was so impressed
with Davidson speeches that they want-
ed to copy notes, and points, as a help
toward their own debating season.

The next contest, with the University
of Miami, took place on Tuesday after-
noon, March 5, at Miami. The debate,
held in the amphitheatre of the public
park, was a non-decision affair, but the
Davidson team “won decisively” in the
opinion of the audience and debaters.

Turning north a few days later,
Stutts and Sugg met a team from Em-
ory University on March 7 in the down-
town Y. M. C, A. in Atlanta. They
won a unanimous audience decision over
the Emory team and report themselves
as greatly impressed with the splendid
Emory debating organization.

The next night the Davidsonians had
a real test of their strength against de-
haters from Georgia Tech. The debate,
another non-decision, was adjudged the
best and closest of the trip by members
of the team. The Tech debaters, well-
versed in their subject, were quick to
meet all arguments advanced by the Da-
vidson team and the debate was consid-
ered a draw by most of the spectators.

The stability of Stutt’s arguments,
mixed with the fiery humor of Sugg’s.
formed a winning combination. Sugg’s
wit, especially his name-calling of the
munitions makers, was appreciated by
the audiences and debaters alike.

The next debating trip begins tomor-
row, March 14, when Tyler Port and
James Salango leave for Centre; Se-
wanee and points west on a_ ten-day
journey.

Celebrate Annual
Barium Day Mar. 2

Youngsters Throng Davidson
Campus And Give Exhibi-
tion Football Game

Davidson’s second annual Barium
Springs Day saw a fair-sized crowd at-
tending the intrasquad game last Satur-
day afternoon.

The idea of having a Barium Springs
Day was originated last year, and was
considered worthy of carrying on in the
future so that the orphanage will prob-
ably continue to claim one day on the
school calendar as its own,

Davidson College feels an especial in-
terest in the Presbyterian Home near
Statesville, because of its past record for
sending to the campus outstanding ath-
letes and campus leaders. There are at
present at least ten Barium men here,
nine’ of whom are football players and
five are participating in more than one
sport. :

Uncle Joe Johnston, the head of Ba-
rium Springs Orphanage, brought down
a big crowd of his youngsters to cele-
brate their day on the campus. The in-
terest which Uncle Joe and the boys
and girls from Barium show in David-
son’s team each year make a good many

Red And Black Masquers Pre-
sent ‘Three Taps At Twelve’
On Friday

The Red and Black Masquers will
offer their second dramatic presentation
of this year on Friday evening, March
22, The club, an honorary society for
achievement in dramatic art, will,.pre-
sent a three-act mystery melodrama, en-
titled Three Taps at Twelve.

The. cast of the play, under the direc-
tion of Edward Doniggan, includes some
new talent as well as others who are
remembered for their performances in
former productions. The cast is as fol-
lows: The Ingenue—Miss Lucie Currie;
The Juvenile Lead—Field Horine; The
Dope Addict—Treadway Purnell; The
Uncle—Richard Hillier; Mrs. Gage—
Miss Letitia Currie; Her Husband—Joe

Dunlap Covington and Dave Herring
are in charge of the renovation of
scenery for this play.

The play is an exciting murder mys-
tery filled) with many anxious moments.
Mr. Jamison Edwards, criptic old mil-
lionaire, invites five of his most bitter
enemies to a dinner party at his palatial
home on the coast of Lake Michigan,
in order to give them all an opportunity
to seek revenge. Jamison suggests a
playful game called Murder, wherein one
of the guests present is ruthlessly mur-
dered.

After an intriguing line of events, the
nephew of Edwards, a young college
graduate, determines the identity of the
guilty person from a few of
collected evidence,

The play, which has been in process
of production for over a*’month, plus
the possibility that “Chubby” King’s
Hotel Davidson Orchestra will be pro-
cured to play during the intermissions,
should provide an evening of excellent
entertainment.

Special attention is called to the fact
that, for the first time in a number of
years, there will be no admission charge.
There will, however, be a free-will of-
fering taken for those who wish to con-
tribute toward the necessary expenses
incurred in producing the . play.

Dr. Harding Delivers Lecture

On “Other Worlds Than Ours”

Speaker Displays Illustrations
And Pictures In Connection
With Talk

Dr. A. M. Harding, professor of as-
tronomy and mathematics in the Uni-
versity of Arkansas, gave an illustrated
in the auditorium of Chambers
Building at 7:30 last Monday evening.

lecture

Taking as his subject, ‘Worlds Other
Than Ours,” Dr. Harding opened
talk with a discussion of the distances
between the bodies of our solar system.

his

He first directed the attention of his

audience to the fact that the’ sun is a
distance of 93,000,000 miles away from
the earth. A. striking illustration of
the magnitude of this distance was the
remark that: “If an express train hid
left the sun on July 4, 1776, and con-
tinued at top speed throughout the in-
tervening period, it would still be far
from the earth!” On thee other hand,
it would take an airplane traveling 200
miles per hour just fifty-three years
to traverse that distance.
- Next he took up the diameters of
the various planets, and compared our
solar system to a vast complex machine,
with the sun at its center, each planet
moving in its own unvarying orbit.

Due to their differing speeds, paths,
and diameters, each planet has a differ-
ent ytar—Mercury, the shortest, about
eighty-eight of our own days; Neptune,
the longest, seven hundred and
five days. For instance: Neptune was
discovered in 1846. <A child born on
Neptune at that time would now be less
than six months old.

The planets vary in their distance
from the earth. Neptune is so remote
that it would take a radio message four
hours to reach it. On the other hand,
the moon is only 238,000 miles off and
a mere 2,000 miles in diameter.

Because the moon shines with reflect-
ed light, it has various phases. If it
received direct sunlight, it would always
appear full. Then, too, the motion of
