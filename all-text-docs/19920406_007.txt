Women's Lacrosse
Edges Duke, Guilford

By Bruce Balestier

With two wins in three games
last week, the Davidson women’s
lacrosse team upped its record to
4-2 in its first season of existence.
The Wildcats split a pair of games
Saturday in a tournament at North
Carolina. In the opener, the ‘Cats
paid back Duke’s club team for a
previous 9-6 defeat with a 15-10
win. The key to the win, according
to Davidson coach Betsy Brown,
was her team’s defensive double-
teams. Wildcat defenders smoth-
ered the Blue Devil attack by col-
lapsing in the fan. Maria Tucker
had four goals and two assists to

lead the scoring for the ‘Cats.
Later that day against the North
Carolina club team, Davidson
squandered a four-goal lead late in
the game as fatigue set in, and lost
17-15. The Wildcats led 14-10 with
six minutes to play, but the Tar
Heels used mass substitutions of
fresh players to come back. Caro-
lina repeatedly won the draw at
midfield, and scored a series of
quick goals to win the game. Brown
allowed that “we lost partially just
due to exhaustion.” Tucker had
five goals and three assists to lead

for just $75,000, but Holland is
vehement i in his assertion that i itis

not worth having a track program |

at that level. “I’d'rather not have a
track team than have the track that
we had,” he says. Holland says
“‘we want the best facility we can
- possibly have,” and insists that a
quality track program can be built
using a fine facility, rather than
scholarships, as the primary at-
tractor. And ina program anchored
by a facility, he reasons, many
more people, including the student
body and the Davidson commt-
nity, will benéfit from its use, rather
than just a few scholarship-hold-
ers. In addition, high school meets
could be held at such a track.

But a track worth having will
set Davidson back at least
$500,000, and, with the athletic
budget frozen (by agreement), that
sets up a monumental task of fun-
draising. All of the money for the
new track must come from private
contributors, and former Davidson
track athletes will be a ‘specific
target. Holland hopes to begin
construction this summer or next
fall, but the starting date will de-
pend on the amount of capital that
has been collected. And realisti-
cally, construction, if itis going to
happen, cannot wait all that long.
A wait of more than a year would
render the already dwindling base
of track athletes virtually non-ex-
istent, and would likely mark a
pointofno return for the Davidson
track programs, In such a case, the
programs might be dropped en-
tirely. So the fundraising race is
on. Says Holland, “I don’t think
we’ ve lost ground; the question is
can we gain ground. That question
can’t be answered yet.”

a balanced Davidson attack.

Brown had anticipated Wed-
nesday afternoon’s game at
Guilford (a varsity Division II
program) to be an indicator of
where the program is headed. She
got some positive feedback on
that question in a 10-7 Davidson
win. The key to the game may
have been that the Quakers, who
had defeated other area jclub
teams, did not take the Wildcats
all that seriously. The ‘Cats found
the net in the first minute and
followed that goal with two more
to take an early lead. “I think we
caught them off guard,” Brown
said. The two teams played the
remainder of the game on fairly
even terms, but the Quakers could
never overcome Davidson’s quick
start. “In the end,” said Brown,
“we just dug in and held onto the
lead, and it was nice to see.”
Megan Snyder scored six times
and Tucker twice for the ‘Cats.

Davidson met N.C. State’s
club team Sunday afternoon in
Raleigh. The Wildcats play at
home Saturday and Sunday
against Wake Forest and UNC-
Greensboro.
