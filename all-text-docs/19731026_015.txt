“We were determined te con-
trel the game with short passes
Saturday because we just dea't
have the size te gain three and
four yards every time we run
the ball Fagg said.

Fagg went on te explain thai.
“We feel that we can stay im the
game er contrel it if we can rm
90-95 plays a game.”

Fagg's strategy peid off as
the Cats ran 92 plays and
averaged 10.4 yards per catch.

Davidsen alse had its best dey
of the year rushing. Halfback
Dave Ingold paced the Cat run-
ners with $8 yards in 14 carries.
Overall, the team picked up 158
on the greund, far and away the
best performance of the season.

Gary Pomeroy and Walt
Walker led the receivers with 13
and 11 catches, respectively.
Tight end Mike Harding had his
best receiving game of the year
as he caught seven passes for 77
yards and one touchdown.

‘Gary, Walt and Mike all had
great games.” Fagg stated.
“They really ran well after cat-
ching the ball and carried the
fight to William and Mary.”

Other offensive performances
cited by Fagg were those of co-
captain Jimmy Hankinson,
tackle Bill Smith, and Dave

Ingold.
‘‘Hankinson had his best

game ever and Bill Smith
showed that he has to be con-
sidered an All-Cenference
selection. Fagg said.

‘Dave Ingold had 308 vards in
the all purpese running
ot tre vear he cememued:

Ingetd had 93 yards rushung.
1 yaeds receiving, and 197 yar-
ds in kickeff and punt returns en
Satverdas

The Cats biggest problem
was their failure te stop Witham
and Mary's running attack. The
Indians averaged just over six
yards a carry as they piled up
419 yards in 68 attempts.

The defense was led by Eciche
Williamson and George
Weicker with 10 umassisted
tackles apiece.

He was also pleased with
sophomore Roger Whitley's
performance at linebacker

“Roger won every con-

- frontation directed at him as far

as hitting was concerned.”
Fagg stated “He's really
shown a lot of improvement this
year.

“It's just a real tragedy that
those guys didn’t win after the
way they plaved Saturday

‘Sometimes you can play just
terribly and still win and have a
good feeling and then you have
a game like those guys had
Saturday and vou lose.
