THE DAVIDSONIAN

BIG BOXING TOURNAMENT TO BE HELD SOON |

CAT TRAX
As They Follow the Red and
Black
By Zeb V. Long, Jr.
+. of

Six games this week and all on foreign
soil is a tough outlook for any basketball
club, but we don’t see how the Wildcats
can fail to do better’ than break even.
If they can just hold the pace they have
set for the last two weeks, the prospect
is very bright indeed. Those freshmen
are so erratic and uncertain that we dare
not make many predictions about them.

A few more games like that one
with Duke and we will be ready to
quit under the strain. Such a thrill
as that one gave has seldom been
experienced around here. The fact
that Werber and Jankoskie were
missing that night is not an alibi.
The Cats were out for blood and
they got a-plenty. Any team in
the state would have bowed to the
Red and Black on that occasion.

The best part of it all was the way in
which the student body backed its team.
It just goes to show that in a crisis the
old time spirit and fight gets the better
of every blooming one of us. We wish
that more big games could be brought
to the hill. The incentive to win is so
much greater when a college of wide repu-
tation and statiding is the visitor. As far
as the students are concerned this is going
to be a great spring for Davidson ath-
letic teams.

For some reason the Wildkittens
haven't been able to get going this
year. There seems to be very good
potential material on the squad, but
the boys don’t know how. to play
together so well. The Oak Ridge
quint made them look bad, and
while we admit that the Cadets had
an excellent team, still the year-
lings should have done better. Hu-
taff, Lane and Milton seem to be
the best shots. It’s hard to tell
about varsity prospects though.

Well, for once we've got to make a
real bow to Joe Johnston and his orphan
wrestlers from up Barium way. That
crew of future Davidsonians certainly put
the cover on the freshman grapplers.
“Pie” Conway was the only Kitten able
to do much. By the way, Conway is
going to make a mighty good man for
next year’s varsity unless we miss a
guess. The boy is good.

Coach Myles has no reason to be
discouraged over his team’s defeat
at the hands of V. M. I. This same
Cadet team licked West Point
pretty decisively earlier in the year.
Most of the bouts went the limit
without a fall, and that is some-
thing to be proud of from David-
son’s viewpoint. The Cats have a
good squad, and they will be heard
from before its all over. A dispatch
from Lexington reads: “The Wild-
presented a strong, well-
coached team, however, and kept
the Cadets from registering a fall.”

cats

We heard a strong Davidson alumnus
say during the past week that everybody
was as strongly behind the college teams
as ever, but that it was getting mighty
disheartening to see the same old story
on the football field—the Wildcats fight-
ing their hearts out only to lose in the
end. Well, all of that is very true, and
the only solution is better trained athletes
before they enter college. Lots of good
men can be induced to come here if the
proper influence is exerted. It calls for
college work and alumni work combined.

THRILLING GAME

Smashing all predictions into bits, the
Wildcat charges of Monk Younger won a
brilliant victory over Duke University’s
Blue Devils here last Thusday night. A
cheering mob of spectators filled Alumni
Gymnasium to capacity. It was the larg-
est crowd of recent years, and it was about

conditions, the furious and determined
assault of the Wildcats swept the visitors
off their feet, and elevated the Red and

were out-smarted, out-fought, and out-
played by a snarling pack of Cats that
would not be denied.

circles.

Captain Chandler, of Duke, dropped in
the first basket of the game, but Captain
Pritchett, of Davidson, soon matched him
with a pair of foul shots, and from this
point the Cats were never headed, At
half time they had a lead of twelve points,
score being 30-18 at this juncture. The
Devils opened a desperate rally in’ the
second half and pulled up to within seven
points of the locals, but the Cats staved
off any further progress. Duke's guard-
ing was excellent during the first. part of
this final period. Toward the end, how-
ever, they seemed demoralized to some ex-
tent and were taking long chances on
everything.

The guarding of Bill Goodson . and
Frontis Johnson was a marvel to behold,
and these two youngsters were responsible
for holding the Devils in check on many
occasions. Pritchett and Calhoun,
sides shooting with deadly accuracy,
played great defensive games, snagging
enemy passes and streaking down the floor
to sink many crips. Rusk, although
greatly outclassed in the matter of getting
the tipoff, his opponent being the lanky

good game and found time to pile up

Croson was Duke's best bet. He scored
seventeen points all told, his great height
enabling him to reach far above the other
players and tip shot after shot into the
net. Rogers accumulated fourteen units
to be next high scorer.

When the final gun sounded pande-
monium broke loose. The throng of ex-
cited fans went wild. Bells began to toll,
auto horns sounded, and six hundred
student voices blended in a mighty shout
of victory. The impossible had happened.
To the victor belongs the laurels, and
never were they more clearly earned than
last Thursday night. It was a Davidson

night.

was Davidson's first contest with a college

well able to take care of themselves. The

In the initial period, the little Gobblers
found the basket early and jumped into
the lead without apparente effort. Half-
time found V. P. I. leading by an eighteen
to eleven score. In the second half, the
freshmen played a speedy brand of ball,
and while holding their opponents score-
thirteen points to claim
victory over the visiting Virginians. The
kittens winning points were registered in
the closing minutes of play.

The Davidson Frosh avenged their for-

strong opposition at the hands of the
hard-fighting junior collegians. Milton,

evening, ringing up 14 points. - Hutaff
and Mathis played good floor games, the
latter being especially gifted in the art of
causing the opponents to miss the basket
on their attempts. The pass-work of
both teams was good, and both were
strong on defense. Gaddy, Triplett, and

Summary :

ter extra periods, while Flythe lost to
Thompson by one minute and one second,
Christenbury, wrestling in the 165 pound
class, was nosed out by McCrary who
got a time advantage of two minutes and
fourteen seconds. Talmon got the best of
Brock, the Wildcat 155 pound man, with
an advantage of some three minutes and
forty-five seconds. Warren fought hard
against Smith, but was outweighed eighty
pounds and lost by three minutes and
fifty-two seconds. Captain Field of V.
M. I. outweighed Brown of the Wildcat
aggregation, and amassed a time ad-
vantage of seven minutes and forty-three
seconds. The fights of Nicholls and Her-
riot, and of Flythe and Thompson were
about as evenly matched as anyone could
wish. They were both anybody's fight
from beginning to end. Christenbury
got the better of his man, McCrary, dur-
ing the first part of the match, but had
hard luck later, and had to fight hard to
keep from being thrown. Warren showed
up well against'a man who outweighed
him by as big a margin as Smith, and
only by skillful wrestling was he able to
keep his shoulder off of the mat. The
regular Cadet 115 pound man was out.
but the way that Cowan was handling
everyone that night probably made him
glad that he was. The Wildcats brought
a strong, well coached team to Virginia.
