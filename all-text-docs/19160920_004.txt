Speaks to Y. M. C. A.

ganized at Davidson.

On Friday evening at 7 o'clock the
first regular meeting of the Y. M.C. A.
for the year was held in Shearer Hall.
At that time Mr. Carl Lehmann, Secre-
tary of Christian Endeavor for the
South, gave a strong address, urging all
of the students to become interested in
some form of active religious work dur-
ing their college careers in order to fit
them for the positions of responsibility
which they will be called upon to fill in
town and church when they have finish-
ed their courses here. Mr. Lehmann
also reviewed the origin and subsequent
history of the Christian Endeavor so-
ciety and the work that it is now doing,
together with an account of the cam-
paign which is now on for an increased
enrollment in the South.

A Christian Endeavor Society was re-
cently organized among the students,
and it was in the interest of this work
that Mr. Lehmann came here for a
short time on Friday. Arrangements
were made to have him .address the Y.
M. C. A. and at’ this meeting the mem-
bers of the Christian Endeavor Society
were present, and others who wished to
join the society were given a chance to
do so.

ciety on Sunday afternoon the following
officers were elected: P. B. Price, pres-
ident; W. C. Cumming, vice-president ;

tary; B. E. Shields, secretary and treas-

STAND BY YOUR COLLEGE.

If-vau think your college’s the best
Tell ‘em so!

If vou'd have it fead the rest
Help it grow.

When there's anything to do,

Vet the others count on you,

You'll feet bully when it’s thru,
Don’t you know.

Hf vou're used to giving knocks,
Change your style;

Throw bouquets instead of rocks
For a while;

Let the other person roast,

Shun him as you would a ghost,

Meet his hammer with a boast
And a smile.

When a stranger from afar
Comes along,

Tell him who and what we are—
Make it strong.

Needn’t flatter, never bluff,

Tell the truth, for that's enough,

Join the boosters—they’re the stuff.
We belong. —Ex.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, September 20, 1916

FROM AN ALUMNUS.
Rochester, N. Y., Aug. 24, 1916.
Davidson Men:

Word has come to me that I might
have the opportunity to speak with you
again in these columns. I do so with a
great deal of hesitation, for more than
ever I realize my in ability to say the
right thing at the right time.

You are face to face with a new year
—one filled with. great possibilities. You
will probably have the largest enrollment
in the history of the college. You will
have men better prepared for college
work than ever before. You have taken
more responsibility upon yourselves than
ever before. With these favorable con-
ditions it is your part to say whether you

will measure up to your responsibilities

and what the record of 1916-17 will be.

It is the privilege of the old men to
lead the work of the campus and show
to the new men that they are expected
to fall into the spirit of Davidson which
was famous before we even started to
kindergarten. We all know that this
“spirit” means briefly—a spirit of con-
structive work for the best interests of
the college, which is best carried forward
when friendly relations exist between all
students,

This year is set in a period of time
which is sceing great questions submitted
to the people of this country and to the
world. More than ever, you should be
willing to put aside small campus dif-
ferences and realize the need for the
larger construgtive work in making the
Davidson student body and organiza-
tions within that body, places where the
best training for leadership can be
secured.

Give all possible support to the men
you have selected to fill) your offices.
Even then, their work will be no “bed
of roses,” and you have it in your power
to help or hinder in a thousand ways,

I can't resist the temptation to just
say that after meeting men from practi-
cally all of the Eastern colleges and
many from the Northwestern colleges,
that I am more than ever glad 1 can
claim Davidson.

Any space given to saying how great
is my personal interest in the work of
this year would be useless. I feel that
this is already known. But I sincerely
wish the very best for each one of you.

Joun P. Wittiams.

TO THE ALUMNI.

Realizing that the best means of keep-
ing the alumni and their alma mater in
close touch with each other is thru the
columns of the college newspaper, THE
Davivsonian will strive during — the
coming year to help in any way that it
can in keeping the alumni posted in re-
gard to affairs on the campus. It also
wants to help each alumnus keep  in-
formed as to the whereabouts and doings
of class-mates and friends of each of
them. The regular news of events on
and near the campus will keep them
posted in regard to the first of these.

In the alummni department of the
paper we hope to devote space each week
to questions from the alumni in regard
to matters in which they are interested
and will see that each of them is an-
swered as well as possible. In the cases
of inquiries about the addresses and oc-
cupations of alumni, we will trv to lo-
cate them by means of the partial record
that the college office has been able to
secure. If this is not successful we ask
that any alumnus or other reader who
knows where the alumnus inquired for
can be found, do us and the inquirer
the favor of letting us know where he
is located.

A prominent alumnus of Davidson re-
cently sent out to various alumni, whose
addresses he could secure, a letter asking
that they co-operate with Tur Davin-

SONIAN by subscribing to the paper and
by showing an active interest in the af-
fairs of the college, especially in the mat-
ter of advertising it and of getting new
men to attend it. At the present writing
quite a number of answers have been re-
ceived by him and it speaks well for the
Davidson spirit and loyalty that only one
of the letters struck a discordant note in
speaking of the matter.

We ask that the alumni co-operate
with us in helping to upbuild the college
and put it before the people as much 1s
possible. We promise also to be of as
much assistance as we are able in at-
tending to matters which the alumni may

CING FRIENDS IN WAR
TIME.

The Strangers’ Bureau of the Salva-
tion Army has been in operation in Eng-
land for twelve months, as an expression
of the desire of General Booth to relieve
the distress caused by the war. During
the year many thousands of appeals for

‘help in tracing missing relatives in some

way or other concerned in the war have
been received from rich as well as poor.
Without expense to the applicants the
Salvation Army has readily placed its
resources at their disposal. Many of
the letters, which come from all parts
of the world, were from wives longing
for news of their husbands; from pa-
rents concerning the whereabouts of
their boys; again and again widowed
mothers have written in pathetic strains
asking to find their only sons; from
young women who were accustomed to
receive regular communications from
their intended husbands, but had sud-
denly lost touch with them; and from
Belgian refugees who were without news
of relatives in their stricken land. The
Salvation Army, being international in
its organization, has unique opportuni-
ties for carrying on such work as this.
It is true that in numbers of cases the
news received has been of the saddest
kind, and as far as possible such intel-
ligence is conveyed personally, to the dis-
tressed relatives; but happily the Bureau

has succeeded in bringing great joy to
many others.

Here are a few typical cases: A
broken-hearted mother, on being inform-
ed of the unhappy fate of her son,
wrote: “I must thank you for your
kindness to me regarding my dear boy.
I shall never forget it, and will tell
everybody how good you were to us.”
An anxious mother, whose daughter at
the outbreak of the war was a nurse in
Constantinople, appealed in a most pit-
eous manner to endeavor to get a mes-
sage from her child. After a great deal
of difficulty the officials were successful
in discovering the daughter’s where-
abouts, and in getting a cheerful and
reassuring message from her to her aged
mother. The relatives of another young
lady, who is filling a very responsible
position somewhere in Syria, were full
of anxiety for her safety. Through.
Army people in one of the -neutral coun-
tries communications were established
with her. An Australian soldier, who
left the homeland when quite a lad, and
who had neglected to write to his pa-
rents, wrote telling frankly how he re-
gretted it, and begged, in a touching
letter, help in tracing them. “Perhaps,”
he said, “I may lose my life in the bat-
tle, and I am therefore very anxious to
put matters right with my parents be-
fore I go into the conflict.” Machinery
was set in motion, and the lad’s mother
was found. His father, it was learned,
had died a few months before. All that
a Canadian soldier could tell on arrival
in England with his contingent was that
he had a sister who used to live some-
where in Sydenham. The sister was
discovered and her address sent to the
boy. This is splendid work, and one
which deserves a great deal more credit
than it has hitherto received —Christian
Work.
