"Cat
+ SIDELINES
ON SPORTS

By 8. MILLNER

SOME THIRTY-THREE Wildcats left for Charleston
this afternoon, a little worse for the wear from last
week’s 25-21 loss to a hopped up, hard hitting Presby-
terian College football team.

The loss was no fluke. P.C. has perhaps the best
halfback in South Carolina in the person of fleet Bobby
Pate and a quarterback second only to Harvey White
and Lowndes Shingler in Bob Waters. For the past three
weeks this duet has dominated the Associated Press
poll for the Palmetto State Back-of-the-Week honors.
Pate won it twice in a row and Waters won last week
for his performances against Davidson.

When you consider that these two were chosen
above the likes of White of Clemson, John Saunders
of U.S.C. and George Usry and Doug Cline of Clem-
son, you realize how good they must be.

* * * * *

WE SAID last week that statistics often tell the story
in the selection of players for honor teams. If this gen-
eralization proves valid, Davidson should have an unde-
feated football team and three all-conference players.

The ‘Cats are first in total offense in the con-
ference, first in passing offense, and first in pass de-
fense. Standings in the other departments are not as

| spectacular, but passing: Fifth in rushing offense,
eighth in rushing defense, and fifth in total defense.

Benson leads in total offense, is third in passing and
seventh in rushing. He has compieted 13 of 25 passes
for 210 yards.. Danny House has snagged all but four
of those passes and ieads the loop in pass catching with
nine for 117 yards and a touchdown.

George Harts is.tied for the lead in the scoring race
with 24 points. Jerry Sheffield is second in punting with
a 43.5 average.

* * s e *

BOTH THE CITADEL and Davidson will be huft-
ing for lack of practice this week due to the antics
of a gal named Gracie. We assume that the Bulldogs
have gotten in only about two good days of work.
Coach Dole has had his charges out every day this
week but the going has been gooey.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: “I believe after that Flori-

Super Sub!

It’s been said that the atomic submarine
“Nautilus” stays submerged so long that it
only surfaces to let the crew re-enlist.
Perhaps for this reason, the Navy has taken
valuable space aboard the ‘‘Nautilus” for the
only soft-drink vending machine in the entire
submarine fleet.

Natnrally (or you wouldn’t hear about it
from us) it’s a Coca-Cola machine. And not
unexpectedly, re-enlistments are quite
respectable.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Benson And Warden’ Doubtful

Starters

By BILL GODWIN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

gainst Tough Bulldogs

Coach Bill Dole’s Wildcats hope to take up tomorrow where Hurricane Gracie
left off—by whipping The Citadel in its Charleston, S. C., stadium.

But it may be rough going
for the locals. The meat of
their small squad, captain Dave
Warden and quarterback Char-
lie Benson, are grounded with
injuries sustained in Saturday's
P.C. clash.

“If Warden and Benson don’t
play,” said Coach Dole this
week,’ we have a very slim
chance’ of winning.”

Tee Redding and Duncan
Morton will share Benson's du-
ties if he doesn’t play. At full-
back the Wildcats have, as re-
placement for Warden, Dave
McCullough and Graham Alli-
son. Bob McAllister may see ac-
tion at Warden’s defensive line-
backing post.

In tomorrow's game will be
the two top pass-receivers of
the Southern Conference: Da-
vidson’s Danny House and Paul

Maquire of the Cadets.

The Citadel line-up also fea-
tures block-busting fullback
Barry Thomas, a 215-pounder;
quarterback Jerry Nettles,
working from the split-T; and

mercurial halfback Bill
Hughes.
Bad weather held both

teams’ practice sessions down
this week. The Charleston hur-
ricane left Johnson Hagood
Stadium flooded, while more
rains battered the Davidson
campus. Coach Dole said of-
fensive moves tomorrow ‘will
depend upon the weather.”
Dole’s main concern is Barry
Thomas. “We've got to stop
him,” he said.‘

Wildcat-Citadel records this
young season are identical: one
and one. Davidson lost to Pres-

after trouncing Catawba, 42-6.
The Cadets won their opener,
48-0, over Newberry, but were
mauled last week by Florida

which is about three minutes
better than he did in the first
meet last year. “If Ecbert keeps
it up—and we can get the oth-

coach broke off, chuckled, and
then continued. “Well, that
would be fine."

The Freshman team. led by

the cake race winner Sterling

hesitated to compare this team
with last year's outstanding

good in practice,” he said, “but
