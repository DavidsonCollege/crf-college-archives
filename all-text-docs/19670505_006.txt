TRUSTEES HAVE CONTROL
Decision Making Follows Planned Course

Who makes the decisions at
Davidson?

Largely, the process of de-
cision making follows a struc-
ture in which the Board of
Trustees exercises the ulti-
mate authority in the affairs
of the college.

The president is an impor-
tant figure in this process. for
from his office come the co-
ordination and supervision of
the four major areas of the
college: the offices of the Dean
of the Faculty: Dean of Stu-
dents: Treasurer and Business
Manager: and Director of Pub-
lic Relations and Develop-

ment.

The assignment of specific
areas of supervision is a fair-
ly recent innovation. The pres-
ent structure of the college
was determined in the spring
of 1966. when a revised cor-
porate plan evolved.

Essentially. what evolved
was a plan for decision mak-
ing. Some offices, notably that
of the Dean of the Faculty,
were expanded in scope. For
instance, the Dean of the Fac-
ulty now receives reports from,
the Athletic Department in,
stead of that office's report-
ing directly to the president.

Under the revised structure.
the president's office was re-
lieved of some of the direct
supervision of areas of the col-
lege. A structure of channel-
ing reports through the four

major offices is provided un-
der the present set-up. Above
this. the trustees exercise the
ultimate contro! over the col-
lege.

Impetus for the revised
structure first came from
the Faculty Self-Study which
was made prior to the visit
last year of a commiltee
from the Southern Associa-
tion of Colleges and Schools.
The trustees subsequently
adopted this revised plan.

“We work much more in-
formally than a lot of organi-
zations because we have the
advantage of fairly direct
channels.”’ President D. Grier
Martin said.

Martin indicated that while
the structure is not inflexible,
it is followed as carefully as

is possible in a small organi-
zation the size of Davidson's.

All of this works by assign-
ment of responsibility, Mar-
tin said.

He outlined briefly his own
role in the process by pointing
out that the four administra-
tive offices receive informa-
tion. recommendations and
suggestions from trustees, fac-
ulty members, students and
alumni. If one of these four
men does not want to make
the decision on a matter. he
comes to the president.

If the matter is of major
importance. a recommenda.
tion for a decision will be
made to the trustees. ‘When
a conflict arises. this is part
of my job.’’ Martin said.

The referral of all major
decisions regarding broad

questions of policy to the
Board of Trustees is’ anal-
gous to the referral of
similar decisions to the own-
er of any business.

In speaking of the role of
the trustees. Martin said that
“they own. the college."’ Trus-
tee control is the nearest thing
to ownership that Davidson
College has, he said.

“They (the trustees) do have
ownership control if they want
to exercise it.”

Martin went on to point out
that this system of decision
making by the trustees works
because “there is give and
take on both sides,”’ both on
the part of the administration
and the trustees.

In his role as chief executive
officer, the head of the facul-
ty, Martin said, ‘‘I operate on
the theory that people in re-

In summary, the job of the
president involves decisions
in both academic and busi-
‘ness matters of the college. as
Fred Sackett, assistant to the
president. pointed out.

Sackett indicated that in
spite of an unusually busy
year, with much of the pres-
ident’s time being taken up
with matters retated to the
business end of the college,
the president has been
active in plans for the fac-
ulty constitution and makes
time in his schedule when-
ever he can fo sit in on Blue
Sky Committee meetings.

“A great deal of leader-
ship’ for all the areas of the
college must come from the
president, Sackett said.

rects certain faults of a more
decentralized system in which
many people were coming di-
rectly to the president when
decisions had to be made.

“Now when something hap-
pens in the academic area,
Dean Johnston (Dean of the
Faculty Frontis Johnston)
examines what comes up
and talks to the people in-
volved. if it is of major im-
portance, he comes to me,
tells me what he thinks, 1
may make certain sugges-
tions. If it is more serious,
the matter will go to the
trustees.”

Speaking of the structure in
general. Martin said that ‘‘so
far there have been no serious
misunderstandings.”

He pointed out that all four
officers have a ‘“‘good under-
standing” of the types of de-

- cisions he wants and expects
