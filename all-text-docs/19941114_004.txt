Exam schedule now
includes afternoon
Sunday testing period

By Mary Laura Moretz

Students who complained last
year about getting home socclose to
the winter holidays now have an
option to get home a little earlier.
Starting with the upcoming winter
exam period, Davidsdn students
can take self-scheduled exams on
Sunday.

SGA Vice President Allison
Sabel cites “student and parent
complaints” about last year’s cal-
endar as the main reason for add-
ing Sunday exam slots to the regu-
lar schedule.

The faculty and the SGA usu-
ally approve the campus calendar

two years in advance.

Exams this semester will be-
gin on Friday, December 16 and
continue through Wednesday, De-
cember 21. Just a morning time
slot will be available on Sunday,
making 11 total exam periods.

Many students welcome the
additional time. Sophomore Mike
Ingram says, ““That’s an excellent
idea. It will facilitate the process
of getting home to family and loved
ones.”

Others seem indifferent to the
change. Sophomore John Salter
says, “Either way, exams are a
losing proposition.”

Bookstore overpricing just a rumor:

By William Robert

Davidson students aren’t the
only ones who pay a lot for their
books. Students at both UNC-
Charlotte and Washington and Lee
University, as well as residents of
the town of Davidson, all must pay
similar prices for what they read,
be it an art history textbook or a
work of “hot” fiction straight off
the New York Times’ bestseller list.

Sixteen titles were selected
from academic disciplines ranging
from economics to English and
from biology to philosophy as well
as works of general literature rang-
ing from classics to contemporary
novels. These books were priced
at the Davidson College bookstore,
the UNCC bookstore, the Wash-
ington and Lee bookstore, and
Main Street Books in Davidson.
Of course, not every store had ev-
ery book, but most of the stores
had a number of the books on the
list of titles.

In terms jof textbooks, there
were no differences in the prices of
most of the titles investigated. The
Worldly Philosophers by Robert
L. Heilbroner, America: a narra-
tive approach by George Brown
Tindall with David Shi, Janson’s
History of Art, and Volume II of
the Norton Anthology of British
Literature were some of the books

wanted.

The Davidsonian editors
are looking for two
especially talented and
dedicated individuals to
carry the newspaper into
the future beginning in
January. The editor-in-
chief will be in charge of
the newspaper itself,
while the business
manager will take care of
finances and general
business functions.

whose prices did not vary from
college to college.

The only differences in prices
for Plato’s Republic, one of the
titles investigated, came from dif-
ferences in the translator and pub-
lisher. The translation at Main
Street Books was by Desmond Lee
and sold for $4.95 while the ver-
sion carried by Davidson’s book-
store, translated by Allan Bloom,
was $15. However, Bloom’s trans-
lation contains a great deal of com-
mentary on the specific passages
and on their place in the Western
philosophic tradition, while Lee’s
translation includes only the text.
Bloom’s edition is also over 300
pages thicker than Lee’s. °

The price of more classic lit-
erary titles, including William
Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury,
Toni Morrison’s Beloved, William
Shakespeare’s Hamlet, and
Gustave Flaubert’s Madame
Bovary, varied only regarding the
publisher and the edition.
Faulkner’s Pulitzer-winning novel
was $2.95 at Main Street Books
but $9 at Davidson’s bookstore;
the difference is that the latter edi-
tion is one in the Vintage Interna-
tional series and includes other in-
formation, including an introduc-
tion. An “ordinary” copy of Ham-
let only costs $3.99 at the college
bookstore but $1 1.95 at Main Street
Books. The nearly eight dollar

difference is due to the latter being
a Norton critical edition of the text,
thus containing a number of essays
examining the play from a variety

of critical standpoints.

Some works of fiction, how-
ever, did not vary at any of the four
stores. Morrison’s novel was
$10.95 at Davidson, UNCC, and

an investigative report

W&L bookstores as well as at Main
Street Books. Robert Joseph
Waller’s popular love story The
Bridges of Madison County was a
consistent $16.95 for a hardback
copy. :
The problem, then, is not one
of the college bookstore; their
prices are comparable, if not iden-

tical, with other college and area
bookstores. However, that does
not change the fact that Davidson

. students still have to shell out big
bucks for books, whether for school
or for pleasure. Perhaps they can
rest assured in the knowledge that
everyone else is doing the same
thing.

Student/faculty roundtable discussion
on requirements for college president

Debate continued from page 3

tradition. One participant says,
“Tradition provides us with a solid
base” to guide future progress. To
alter tradition, many argued, would
require that “‘we root ourselves in
another perspective.” Some feared
that Davidson would root itself in
a “secular perspective.” The gen-
eral consensus on both sides of the
issue was that “changes [would]
affect the identity of the school.”

Those who favor changing the
by-laws were not convinced that
Davidson’s “religious character
constitues the essence of
Davidson.” They pointed to the
college’s talented student body,
dedicated teachers, and other ob-
jective features which would not
be affected by a change i in the by-
laws.

issue were also concerned that the
by-laws are religiously discrimi-
natory against people of other
faiths. The point was made that of
the eight Presbyterian, Southern
schools, only one, Hampdon-
Sydney, still requires that its presi-
dent be Presbyterian. Thus, a
change in the Davidson by-laws,
many felt, was in step with current
trends among Presbyterian schools.

Many felt that Davidson was
possibly cheating itself out of hir-
ing the most qualified person to be
president by limiting the applicant
pool to Presbyterians.

A point which seems to have
been original to the discussion con-

cerns the board of trustees. It was
stated that a majority of the trust-
ees are required by the Davidson
constitution to be Presbyterian. As
long as this stipulation remains,
many argued, a change in the by-
laws regarding the president will
be irrelevent. The trustees will
always hire a Presbyterian, some
stated. If the SGA wanted to en-
sure that candidates of all faiths
had.an opportunity to become presi-
dent, the composition of the board
would ultimately have to be
changed. Most members of the
discussion seemed to think this is
an unattainable goal.
