With only a week remaining of the spring athletic pro-
gram Davidson's athletes settle down to the final push for
honors. May 13, a week from Saturday sees the last scheduled
event of the year as the baseballers, cindermen, and golfers
see action. © After that it’s back to the books for the grind
prepping for exams. In the past Davidson athletes have
never been excessively bothered by studies, though of course
the usual difficulties occur to. them as they do to everyone
else. But generally speaking most of the athletes are as
good as the next fellow under the stern gaze of the professors.
Even with practice taking up considerable time, and with
trips causing them to get behind in their work, they have
managed to keep up all right, and make a good showing,

Possibly one reason is the reasonable program that Da-
visdon pursues in her athletic policy. No wonder men are
hardly able to pass even the crippiest subjects when they
are so tired from léng practice that they can hardly move.
Some schools hold football drills from three until after dark,
and then under the floodlights, then after supper there are
more drills in the form of skull practice in the gym. Be-
sides this they sometimes take trips ranging from four or
five days to the extensive two weeks trip that one major
football team took not long ago. Maybe that is one of
the reasons why they have to include courses for athletes
such as the mythical “Roman Band Instruments.”

Cats Lose In Eleventh

Getting

away trom the scholastic side for a pleasant
change we notice the head farther over on the page, “Virginia
Downs Cats in Extra Inning Tilt; Thomas Goes Route.” To
lose such a game was a heart-breaking thing after holding
the highly touted Virginia Cavaliers for eleven innings. Beaten
only twice previously, the Virgitiians presented a formidable
line-up, but the Cat nine matched them for ten frames, only
to lose in the ill-starred eleventh. Hayseed Thomas gave up
twelve hits while the Cats gave him nine to work with. While
the long twilight shadows fell the Virginians smashed out

double with one away. got another man

aboard on an errof,
and: then came through with a single that scored both. Flies
to Hunter and Hicks retired the side.

Hemphill led off for the Cats with two runs needed to
tie the score again, and got on through an error by the short-
stop. After two outs, Hicks knocked a single only to see
himself and Hemphill die on base as the left-fielder retired
the Cats with his catch of a fly. Edmundson led the hicko- |
ry-benders with three for six.

Some Intramural Statistics

Browsing around in the intramural office the other day
Wwe noticed a few statistics that might he interesting now as
interfraternity and interclass intramurals are nearing the finis
sign for this year. ThesPhi Gams are out ahead in the frat
trace with 663 points, chasely followed by the Phi Delts with |
648 points. In the third position are the Sig Eps who hold |
599 points. With three |
ball, and varsity competition, it is possible for either of these
three to win the cup, or indeed for the Kappa Sigs, who have
a 588 total. This year it has been a close race all the way with
the leaders winning footlyall (tie), basketball, and batminton.,
With an average of twenty-nine men competing from
each fraternity it is noteworthy that eight of the nine fra-
ternities are within four men of this mark. According to
Whittle’s chart the S. A. E.’s have had the most men com-
peting in intramurals thus far, 32, and the Kappa Sigs aren’t
far behind with 31. A total of 263 men have taken part in
interfraternity competition.
Two hundred and forty-two men have been
interclass competition, 75 of whom were freshmen, It appears
that students fel the effects of age, for the. seniors have less
men competing than any other class, the juniors, next, sophs
third, and the freshmen most of all. Guess by the time we
get to be seniors it is time to begin studying in the after-
noon, Soe

Another Track Win

Pete Whittle and the Citadel coach have really got this
track business down to science. They claim that each had the
final results of the meet figured out beforehand to within
a half point of the correct score. Better than Enoch, the
Lizard, and that gang! Boo Walker continues to shine in
his senior year as track captain, tying for first in the three
longest distances, the half, one, and two mile runs. He must
have compiled an amazing number of points for Davidson
during his three years of varsity competition.

Whittle continues to come through with a new man each
week to add points to the Cat total. “This week it’s Charlie
Sample again—high point man for his first time with wins
in the pole vault, 220 dash, and a second in the 100 yard dash
for 13 points. The dashes on The Citadel cinders wére especi-
ally close. In the 100, won by Gare
ing men were within a foot of ¢

Dave Warden really was chunking the shot around Sat-

42 feet, two inches, one inch short of his best throw since
he has been entered in the weight event.

Kits Trounce

P.Jj.C. 10 To 2

Davidson's freshmen nine down-

ed Presbyterian Junior College by
the score of 10 to 2 last Wednesday
in their only encounter of the week.
Their game with the Purple Whirl-
wind of Greensboro, scheduled for
Saturday, was called off because of
wet grounds and will be played
possibly at a later date.

Ed Lucas pitched his best game
of the year for the Kittens, limit-
ing the J. .C’s to and
striking out ten men. He grew bet-

four hits
ter as the game progressed, and did
not allow but one hit after the
third inning. Tommy Yarborough,
diminutive Frosh second
led the Kit’s 14 hit attack with
three singles and a double in five
trips to the plate. Lucas also hit
well with three for five, while War-

baseman,

ren secured two of the Presby-
terian’s four hits.

Frosh Scoring
The Presbyterians opened the

scoring in their half of the first on
a walk and Warren's triple to deep
center field. They chalked up on
another run in the second on a
two base error on an outfield fly
and Warren's hit, a
Their lead « was __ short-
lived, however, for the Kits, after
scoring one run on the first on
Morris’ two bagger into the stands,
hopped on Ward's offerings in the
fourth for four hits and three funs.
After Nelson got on by error, Yar-
brough, Carter, Owens, and Lucas
singled in succession for the runs.
They tallied three more in the sixth
on three, walks, an error, and two
hits. In the ninth they reached the
second P. J. C. righthander for
five hits and three more runs to
sew up the Game.
Next Game

The Kittens played host to R. J.
Reynolds High’ of Winston-Salem
yesterday, but it was not in time for
publication. Friday they travel to
Badin to seek revenge for a shell-
acking handed them in an earlier
game. The postponed Greensboro
game will possibly be played there

Virginia Fray Goes to Eleven Frames; Singles and
Error End Game in Favor of Cavaliers

Davidson's Wildcats suffered four
defeats during the past week, los-

ing to North Carolina, 8-4, two
games to Duke, 8-5 and 12-4, on the
swing through the northern part

of the state, and being vanquished
by the University of Virginia at
home} by a score of 8-6, in an 11-
inning thriller.

The game with the Cavaliers
started off as a pitcher’s battle be-
tween Jim Thomas and Nick Nich-

ols. The first score came in the
third inning when “Nipper” Nist-
vad, the invaders’ colorful center-

fielder, lined a home run into right-
centerfield with the bases empty.
They added two more in the second
when McCann scored on Sargent’s
triple, the latter romping home on
a sacrifice fly.

The Wildcats broke the scoring

ice in the sixth with three runs.
Eddie Steere walked, J. D. Hicks
and “Rusty” Edmundson singled,
and “Rusty” Hellekson doubled.

Two walks and a single by Ed-
mondson scored two in the seventh,
Frank Niven’s triple and Jim Thom-
as’ double tied the score in the
eighth,

The Cavaliers won the ball game
in the eleventh when two men
crossed the plate on Nistad’s single,
an error by Hemphill, and a single
by Burnes.

Lose to Tarheels

Against the Tarheels at Chapel
Hill, the Wildcats hit the ball hard
but were not able to bunch their
blows effectively.

J. D. Hicks, on the mound for
the locals, was’ no puzzle to. the
Phantom hitters and was touched

for 13 hits in his seven inning
stretch on the rubber.
Duke's Blue Devils unleashed

their full power against the Wild-
cats on Saturday to sweep a dou-
ble bill, 8-5, 12-4.

Dave McLeant toed the slab in
the opener and pitched effective
ball until the fifth when the Devils
teed off for five runs. The big blow
of the frame was Shoke’s long dou-
ble which emptied the loaded sacks.”

The Wildcats boynced back into
the ball game in the seventh by
scoring four runs, mainly by virtue
of Eddie Steere’s double, which
chased three men across the plat-
ter.

Edmundson, Steere, and Hunter
helped the local cause with two
