Holland Responds to Critics and Explains Decision

By Robert Lloyd-Still

Last week, two Davidson pro-
fessors accussed the Davidson Ath-
letic Department of sexism in the
cancellation of a women’s basket-
ball game scheduled for February
22 against Radford. David Martin
(Economics) and Mary Anne
Moore (Physics) argued that the
schedule change “humiliated the
women’s team.” These professors
ended their faculty resolution by
stating, “Davidson College should
not be a money-grubbing institu-
tion.”

Davidson Athletic Director,
Terry Holland, and Senior
Women’s Administrator, Caroline
Price, strongly disagreed with the
accusations made by the profes-
sors. Both Holland and Price felt
that not all of the facts came out on
this case. The Charlotte Observer
article thatuncovered the story last
week left the perception that Hol-

land had decided to cancel the
women’s game only a day or two
before. However, the decision was
actually made back in December.
Between December and the release
of the article
on February
22, there was
ample time
for Martin
and others to
present their
concern
about the
cancellation
of the game.

In December, when Davidson
played UNCC in the NCAA Tour-
nament, arepresentative of UNCC,
Judy Rose, told Holland that the
UNCC men’s basketball team had
been forced out of the Coliseum
for their scheduled match against
Furman on February 15. Holland
checked with Bob Price to see if

Holland

February 15 was an open date in
Belk Arena. Unaware that there
was a women’s game scheduled
for that same night, Holland told
UNCC that they could play at
Davidson.

Sometime later in December
ata scheduling meeting, women’s
basketball coach, John Filar,
pointed out that there was a
women’s game scheduled for the
same night as UNCC versus
Furman. Price had thought that the
women’s game was scheduled for
that afternoon. Filar checked pos-
sible options with the Radfordteam
and Holland called UNCC to see if
they could reschedule their game.
After looking at some options
(doubleheader, early afternoon, dif-
ferent date) Filar decided that the
best thing to do was cancel the
game. Holland made sure that this
was what Filar wanted to do. Hol-

land argued that “there was no

undue pressure put on Coach Fi-
lar.”

There were over two months
between the cancellation of the
game and the release of the article
on February 22 when Martin and
Moore could have presented their
opinions on the issue. Instead of
attending athletic council meetings,
the professors decided to present a
faculty resolution and to discuss
the issue with the Observer.

Holland took much offense to
the segment of the resolution that
attacked his decision as money-
grubbing. “The money itself is
obviously not a major factor witha
budget of our size.” Holland con-
tinued, “We did not want to make
this a bribe, but we did make it
clear that the money was going
back into the women’s program.

That was nota critical issue. The —

issue was that we had two games
scheduled for the same time.”

While Holland did not regard
the money as an issue, he exempli-
fied Davidson’s committment to
women’s athletics, “the only bud-
gets we are increasing in the ath-
letic departement at this time are
the budgets of our women’s pro-
grams as we try and bring them up
to speed with our men’s programs.”

Price vehemently defended the
decision of Holland and she felt
the charge of sexism was ludi-
crous. If there were any concerns
they could have been voiced, they
did not need to go to the Observer.
“Before setting up a resolution,
there is a system in place, a tre-
mendous climate to provide for the
bestcommunication. I would have
loved it if David Martin had said
that he disagreed with the cancel-
lation.”

Holland stated, “this was
strictly supposed to be a good sa-
maritan effort.”

Leadership In Unlikely Place

Alpert.continued from page 14

NCAA’ sis arealistic goal. This he
hopes would reward all the
hardwork the team has put in, as
well as increase support for the
team by students and alumni in the
coming years, which he feels has
room for improvement

Alpert describes his role on
this team as running the offense,
making sure everyone is in the
correct spots on the floor, distrib-
uting the ball, and shutting down
the opposition’s point guard on
defense. Any points that Alpert
scores are an added bonus, as is the
extraordinary number of rebounds

he has beenable to pull downlately.
Alpert had nine rebounds in the
tough Hornet’s Nest Classsic home
game versus UNCC.

Chris, the student, is unsure of
what he wants to major in, but he
hopes to continue playing basket-
ball after school and then enter the
field of communications or law.

Alpert will finish the season
with a torn lateral meniscus in his
right knee; this seems to be charac-
teristic of his commitment to the
game, to his teammates, and to his
coaches. I wish Chris Alpert and
the rest of the Wildcats luck as the
season winds down and tourna-
ment time gears up. $

Baseball Takes North
Carolina AT&T;
Then Falls to Wake

By Will Cobb

The Davidson baseball team
opened its home play with a 9-1
win over the North Carolina A & T
Aggies. Because the Aggies ar-
rived to the game an hour late, the
game had to be called after 6 1/2
innings. The weather was ex-
tremely cold and windy, not pre-
ferred baseball weather, but
Davidson managed to pull out an

. easy win. Randy Spaw pitched for

the Wildcats, giving up only one
run, three hits, and one walk in
seven innings.

Davidson beat up the Aggies
with ten hits to help push their
record to 2-1. Davidson started the
route with five runs in the second
inning and _ they collected four

more in the fourth. Leading the
way was senior Rick Bender, who
was three for four with one. run
scored and one RBI. -

. Also hitting well was junior
Paul Brannan who went 2 for 4
with one run scored, one RBI, and
one stolen base. Another major
contributor was Jazz Frietas, who
scored a run, batted in a run, and
stole two bases. The team played
good defense and Spaw pitched an
excellent game, keeping most balls
in the infield.

On Saturday, with much bet-
ter weather, the team faced a tal-
ented Wake Forest squad.
Davidson fell 6-2, but played quite
well. Davidson was held to four
hits.

The ‘Cats jumped out to a 2-0

_ lead in the bottom of the first. The

rally began when Freitas reached
first on a walk. Freitas advanced to
second when Bender reached first
base on an error. Two batters later,
junior Clay Hall lined a shot up the
right field line that scored both
runners.

Chris Carrigan pitched seven
innings, giving up four runs (three
earned) on ten hits with one
strikeout and three walks. Carrigan
did a solid job on the mound while
facing a good hitting Deacon squad.
He gave up no runs in the fourth
after the Deacons loaded the bases
with only one out, and surrendered
only two runs in the sixth when the
Deacs loaded the bases with no
outs.

The Deacons were able to
gather up two more runs in the last
two innings to put the game out of
reach, The ‘Cats fought back and
they loaded the bases in the eighth
inning. Unfortunately for Davidson _
acheck swing sent the ball straight
to the pitcher and Wake Forest
made the double play.

The crowd was small but en-
thusiastic. On Tuesday, Davidson
will face the North Carolina
Tarheels at 2:00 PM.
