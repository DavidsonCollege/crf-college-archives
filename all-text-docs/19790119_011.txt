concerned that any vote against
self- scheduled ¢ as an ex-
pression of tulty’s lack of

faith in the Honor System.”

Professor of English Charles
E. Lloyd, however, disagreed.
“I think we’re demanding too
much of students by offering
self-scheduled exams. It robs
them of their good effect. I
would give them if I didn’t have
this feeling that it’s too much to
ask for students to keep quiet.”

Norman Koller, Professor of
Sociology, expressed uneasi-
ness over whether the present
system can discourage chea-
ting. “‘The key variable in
understanding cheating is op-
portunity. The goal should be to
minimize opportunities for
cheating. The biggest cheating
scandals have occurred in
schools that have strong honor
systems along with enormous
academic pressures.”

Professor of History David
Shi agreed with Koller. “The
knowledge that if you want to
cheat you can get away with it
tends to push the marginal
student over the brink. Psycho-

logical studies have shown that .

incidents of cheating are direct-
ly related to the perception that
one can get away with it. I
believe we must admit that it is
possible to go too far in testing
human nature through pres-
sure We aren't here to build
character through temptation.”

Contrary to Shi, Brown felt
the school’s role in instilling
ethical values is crucial. “The
Honor System has a lot to do
with the Statement of Purpose
and Davidson’s church affilia-
tion. Whatever decision is
made, it must be reached in
light of our goal to instill a
sense of ethical responsibility in
students.

what effect it will have on the
overall Honor System.”

Professor of Biology Cynthia
Grant emphasized the impor-
tance of the Honor System in
everyday life. ‘I would hope
that students are consciouse of
the system in their daily lives as
well as during exams. It should
extend to labs, papers, reviews
and our treatment of other
people.’

Terry pointed out, ‘We have
sold the Honor System for too
long on its convenience espe-
cially in regard to self-scheduled

exams. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt ©
to be a bit idealistic about the

code.”’

Kelton commented,
think you can make it hard
enough to cheat. Any tigh-
tening up would not appreciably
cut down on cheating. —

Perhaps the biggest threat to
the code is a reluctance of the
students to turn in fellow
students. Most do not cheat.
But when a student sees some-
one else cheating, it’s too easy
to rationalize that he did not see
the incident clearly enough to
merit suspicion.’

Kelton also observed that a
major failure of the self-sche-
duled system lies in the fact
that some professors avoid
using it.

Terry also noted that many
faculty members ‘handle sus-
pected honor violations on their
own” by avoiding the measures
described in the Code of Disci-
plinary Procedure and by failing
the student.

McKelway noted that faculty
qualms over cheating cause
modifications in the kind of
exam a professor feels he can
give. “At this point the system
seems to be disrupting the
educational process. An in-
structor must, for example,
keep in mind that objective
questions are probably more
transmissable than subjective
ones.”

However, McIntyre empha-
sized that the station will
continue to play predominantly
classical music. ‘‘I was hired by
the administration to imple-
ment the wish of the Trustees,
which is to broadcast classical
music. I think this is where our
principle audience is, and I hope
to broadcast the best classical
music possible,” He said.

were: (1) “Such a committee

play no decisive role in tenure
evaluation” and (2) (the faculty)
“would have to pay too great a
price; what we would lose in
collegiality would not: be worth
ahy slight improvement that
might conceivably be made.”

In response to Holland's first
argument, Patterson said, ‘I

a great deal of weight.”

Much of the opposition was .
related to:-Holland’s: second '

point, however, in that the
faculty was unwilling to accept
the responsibility of serving on
the committee.

Professor of Philosophy Ro-
bert Maydole said faculty mem-
bers ‘“‘have no desire to serve on
the committee.”

Although he personally sup-

- ported the tenure committee,

Maydole described the respon-
sibility of evaluating colleagues
as a ‘distasteful duty.”

He said another argument
against the proposal was that
the committee would be ‘“‘an
instrument of denial of tenure in
more. instances.’

He also said there was fear
that the Vice President could
misinterpret a recommendation
of the tenure committee: a
recommendation of approval
but with reservations could be
interpreted as a negative opi-
nion, thus leading to denial of
tenure.

Patterson added, ‘‘Any type
