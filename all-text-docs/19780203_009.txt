academic freedom, re-evaluation, and tenure.

‘In the past and up until the
present the faculty has not known
how tenure decisions are reached
and can only surmise that a
procedure exists,’’ said Professor
of Spanish Lois Kemp.

This settlement reflects the con-
tinued concern expressed by a
number of faculty members re-
garding the question of tenure.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs Price Zimmermann has
outlined the three main areas of
evaluation: professional compe-
tence, teaching effectiveness and
community service. The third
criterion has raised the most
questions among the untenured
faculty.

Community service

As one untenured professor
said, ‘‘Neither the questions nor
the procedure has been cleared up,
especially the question of com-
munity service. What do they
mean? What are these community
criteria?”

“Community service begins at
the threshold of the department,”
explained Zimmermann. ‘‘We
mean a dimension of community
concern, a person interested in so-

~‘{t’s almost an insult not to submit

ciety and the world.

“We could be dogmatic but we
don’t do that,”’ he continued.

Zimmermann went on to say
that this service could find expres-
sion in many ways such as partici-
pation in a faculty research group,
sponsoring a student extra-curri-
cular activity serving a local
church. ne

He added that it was up to the
individuals as to which method
they choose to express. this
community service.

‘We want people here who have
concern for others and express this
concern,‘ Love thy neighbor as
thyself?” he said.

This criticism with the present
standards is by no means univer-
sal among tenured or untenured
faculty.

She said that at present only. the
Philosophy Department practices
this principle, but she intends to
start such a system in the Spanish
Department.

Professor Emeritus of Philoso-
__.__ phy George Abernethy explained,
“All evaluation ought to be a con-
tinual process. If a professor's

decisions on promotions and tenure. Unfortunately, this has
sometimes worked to the disadvantage of those who did not ‘fit
in” to this community. But any academic society with any claim
to eminence must include members who do not fit into
conventional molds. I would favor making tenure appointments
only on the basis of intellectual and academic promise, as
evidenced in teaching and scholarship. And I would favor
raising the standards of tenure in this area. ,

My other conviction is that tenure decisions should be made
only after an evaluation of the faculty member’s performance by
a faculty committee. This, unfortunately, has never been the
procedure followed at Davidson. As a result, decisions have
sometimes been made which seemed to reflect considerations
more personal than professional. I am firmly of the opinion that
faculty members are the best qualified judges of a colleague’s
academic promise and achievement, and that they should take
the responsibility, onerous as it often is, of making tenure
recommendations. Such a faculty committee should, of course,
include the Academic Vice President and the President, both of
whom, at Davidson, are members of the teaching faculty. It
should also have access to the evaluations of the department
chairman, other senior faculty members, and students. It might
also consult scholars outside the college. But the faculty should
not willingly entrust the task of making a professional
judgement to any other agency than a body made up of its own
members. .

The Commission on Academic Tenure also commented ‘in
1973: ‘In some institutions an effort is made to assist the young
faculty member to develop as a teacher and scholar; in many,
the young teacher is given virtually no assistance or information
about his strengths or shortcomings until the time of final
decision on reappointment.’’ Here again, Davidson seems to be
in the second category. All too often neither the department
chairman nor the Academic Vice President has offered help and
encouragement to the younger faculty member in a way which
would lead to the improvement expected by the time of a tenure
decision. The college is generous in providing funds for summer
study and research and for attending professional meetings. But
personal support offered to a.younger colleagueuby an aldor one
can be even more effective in aevcropimg-a' mature and huniane
scholar and teacher.

Avinger, Dean of the Center for
Special Studies added, ‘‘At the
moment I’m not too concerned
about academic freedom. We don’t
have the situation now we had
during radical unrest, the Red
Scare and Vietnam. The question
of academic freedom is not a
pressing one, yet its something
that you don’t want to forget
about.”’

Faculty Evaluation

Closely tied to the tenure ques-
tion is the issue of faculty evalua-
tion

“Within the faculty there is a
general reluctance to be scrutini-
zed, evaluated, to be looked on by

your peers. Yet a good system
would really necessitate it.’’ Ex-
plained Avinger. —

Some of the untenured faculty
place the blame for this reluctance
by the faculty to have a hand in
evaluation and tenure decisions
squarely on the shoulders of the
senior professors.

“Once you’re tenured you don’t
need to worry about it,’’ one
professor said. ‘‘The senior faculty
seems to be rather apathetic.

“It’s a hard decision to make
and its much easier to pass it off
on the big bad administration and
then we can hate them for it. It’s
human nature to pass the buck on
up, but I think the faculty ought
to have a hand in it."’

Professor of Psychology, John
Kello indicated his willingness to
be evaluated.

“It’s almost car. insult not 4
submit the faculty to periodic

ginning, it helps him to become a

better teacher, to develop him into -
the kind of person who could get
tenure.”

Communication

One untenured professor pin-
pointed Davidson's main problem
like this, “the problem at David-
son is a lack of communication.
The administration is hesistant
and uneasy about being frank and
cadid with either faculty or, stu-
dents. It’s much easier for the
administration to send out a
memo than to discuss it person-
ally.”

Zimmermann answered this
complaint, ‘“‘Any faculty member
who wants to communicate with
me or Dr. Spencer is not only free
to come but encouraged to come by
and see us.”

Kello summarized faculty frus-
tration about tenure, ‘‘At David-
son tenure has been given almost
automatically in the past. I think
that the administration feels this.
Dr. Zimmermann feels this. But
there are always some difficulties.
One has to-be careful when things
are being changed that everyone
understands the goals.’’

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. attempted to allay
faculty questions about the tenure
policy.

‘When there is a new dean and

rience with that person, there is
