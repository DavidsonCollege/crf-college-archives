... CONnfide in ice in Marshall's ability

Bonnie Wright), Marshall will
have to take over without any
prior experience.

Both Baskin and Crawford
expressed confidence that
‘Peyton Marshall will be able
to overcome these initial diffi-
culties, saying that’ Marshall
is ‘‘extremely bright, well-
respected and dias articu-
late.”’

Marshall labelled educa-
tional values ‘‘one of my chief
interests.’’ He said that he is

“interested in thinking further
about them and trying to see
some of them put into action
at Davidson, where the oppor-
tunity to pursue particular
academic interests has been
vital in the development of
some of my ideas.”

The question has been
raised, by Dr. Frontis W.
Johnston, Chairman of the
EPC, that it may have been
inappropriate for the SGA to
appoint Marshall to the com-
mittee. He pointed out that

the EPC By-Laws provide for

only one student representa-.

tive, with the provision that
another could be added if the
committee decided that was in
its best interest.

Baskin responded by saying
that he was well aware of this
provision in the By-Laws, but
that there have always been
two students on the commit-
tee. “‘We’re going to presume
we can have two and if they
want to tell us otherwise that’s
fine,’’ said Baskin.

Another main observation Hall
mentioned was the quality of the
relationships.
‘‘Students don’t seem to be able to
relate to their professors on a personal
level. This is very disappointing
because Davidson seems like the type
of place which could and should be a
very close caring community,’

1. Preamble. The College is committed to the
proposition that the student wishes to learn and must
thus be provided with the resources, the guidance, and
the freedom to do so. Within this context, all members
of the College share responsibility for securing and
