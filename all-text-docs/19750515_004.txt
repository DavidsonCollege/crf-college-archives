Smith sparks college union association

By BRAD SWALWELL
Staff Writer

Director of the College Union
C. Shaw Smith has recently
finished: his term of office as
President of the Association of
College Unions--International.

According to an association
publication, the purpose of the
association ‘‘...is to provide an
opportunity for unions to join in
studying and improving their
organizations, services,
programs, facilities. and per-
sonnel and to assist in the
development of new college
unions.”’

The association (founded in
1914) views the union as a center
for all members. of the college
community: students, faculty,
administration, alumni, and
guests. To the association, ‘‘the
union is part of the educational
program of the college’ and
tries to ‘‘serve as a unifying for-
ce in the life of the college.”’

Davidson’s union is just one of
over 800 member unions from
such countries as the United
States, Canada, Great Britain,
Australia, New Zealand, Japan,
Taiwan, the Philippines, and
Puerto Rico. :

Smith has’ served the
association in many capacities.
He has served on numerous (too
numerous to list) panels and
committees. He served as Host
Director for the 1959 Conference
of the association and gave the
keynote address at the 1967 Con-
ference in Philadelphia.

Butts Whiting Award

In 1972, the association awar-
ded Smith its highest award--
the Butts Whiting Award. Smith
is one of only 7 receipients of

_ the award, and having received
it before he was elected
president of the association, is
the only person to receive the
award without being president
first.

Smith was elected President
of the association in 1973 and
took over the chair of the
association in April, 1974. He
will now continue to serve on
the executive board of the
association for another one year
as immediate past president.

Smith’s duties as president
are stated only as ‘‘carrying on
the business of the association.”’

This brief, simple statement
of duties, however, is very
misleading, Smith has worked
extremely hard this last year in
his position as president.

Smith (in his capacity as
president) has attended many
conferences during this past
year, held in such places as:
Greensboro, Kearney.
Nebraska: Texas A & M:
Oregon; Denver: Philadelphia:
Terra Haute, Indiana: and San
Luis Obispo, California. He has
participated in the dedication of
college unions at East Carolina.
Toledo, and California State
University at Los Angeles.

Naturally, Smith’s duties
have kept him away from the
college a great deal of the time.
Both Smith and the college
knew this when Smith aecepted
the post.

“T never thought I would be

president of the association, .

simply because I didn’t have
enough time. considering my
duties here at Davidson,” com-
mented Smith. ,

Top-notch assistant

“But the college has sup-
ported me beautifully in this
venture. First of all, they
brought in a top-notch assistant
director in Russ Kushigian.
Russ is an experienced union
programmer, soI could afford to
be away from Davidson.

“Secondly, the college did not
cut the secretarial help here at

‘the union when the Placement

department was movedtoCham-
bers. I. still have two
secretaries. The correspon-
dence I do for the association
could not have gotten done with
just one secretary.”’ :
Smith served the association
well as its president according
to many in the association. This
reporter conducted phone in-
terviews with several of Smith’s
colleagues in the association.
Howard Henry, director of
the Union at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
said ‘I have never met a man
as dedicated as Shaw Smith is
to the college union cause. Shaw

eile tiene

“The right program creates a House of Serendipity. That
is. people should discover things at the Union which they

--C. Shaw Smith

constantly retiected this
dedication during his year as
president.”

Paving lip service

Marilyn Lipsius,an association
colleague of Smith’s and a
professional entertainment
manager in New York. com-
mented: ‘If any person con-
nected with the business end of
entertainment wants to talk toa
solid, reliable, knowledgable
person in the college union field,
the first name-they think of is C.
Shaw Smith.”’

Chester Berry. executive
secretary of the association at
the association offices in
Staford, Caifornia, said:
“Shaw’s unique qualities ser-
ved the association very well
during his year as president. He
worked himself nearly to
exhaustion, visiting 14 of out 15

regions during the year.”’
“Shaw is fiscally a very
responsible person; _ this

probably comes _ from his ex-
peiences in a small college
where dollars are hard to come
by. He insists on getting the
most for the union’s money:
Shaw feels an ethical respon-
sibility for how the union’s
money is spent.”

Berry also commented about
the personal qualities which

Shaw brought to the
association. .
Personableness

“Shaw is a very personal
fellow. He really personalized
the association. He saw to it
that people were taken care of.
even if it wasn’t the most ef-
ficient thing for the association
to do. Shaw cares about peole.”’

This personableness of
Smith’s can be seen in his views
and ideas on unions and their
purpose.

“There are three main com-
ponents of a union.” stated
Shaw.

“The first is atmosphere. The
building and what’s inside the
building must communicate
with people. It must say
something: it must say. ‘This is
a different kind of place. Come
in and be vourself,’’’ said
Smith.

“The second component is ac-
tivities. or what kind of
speakers. shows, programs,
and activites the union offers.
We have the greatest op-
portunity in the union to help
improve student-faculty
relationships.

House of Serendipity

“The right program creates a
House of Serendipity. That is,
people should discover things at
the union which they did not
mean to discover, simply
because there is so much in the
union.”’

“For example. we come to
the union for a cup of coffee, but
notice a painting which excites
our minds and hearts. That’s
serendipity.

“The third component is at-
titude. The union is for the
student: it is to help the student.

“The basic hope that we hold
as first priority is to help
students discover what is most
important to themselves per-
sonally The complex and
varied backgrounds and_in-
terests of our people are
brought together to make a
people union.”’

. Smith feels that the people
are the most important part of
the union.

He remarked at the
association’s 1974 Conference:
‘We want to do such great
things and we plan to do them,
but somehow other things which
are important too. but maybe

_ hot as important as they seem.

keep getting in the way. We

want to help the student, but we

have to build the building first.
“Our priorities are hazy. We

are going to do more for stu-
dents just as soon as...well,right
after we’ve...later,yeah,later.’’

Smith’s term as president of
the association has, not been
without benefits for Davidson:
it has undoubtedly helped put
the name of Davidson College in
front of people.

‘Without a doubt he (Smith) is
the most well-known person in
the field,’ commented Assistant
Director of the Union Russ
Kushigian. :

Lipsius also commented that
““Shaw’s contributions to the en-
tertainment industry via the
college are immeasurable. The
sophistication of Davidson
College in regards to en-
tertainment are due in large
measure to Shaw Smith.’

During his years with the
association. Smith set up the
Coffee House Circuit. This is an
association of college unions set
up to introduce new talent on a
shoe-string budget. The per-
formers make a name through
repeated performances at such
things as Davidson’s Hungry
Hof

Performers like DonMcLean,
Brewer and Shipley. John Den-
ver, and McKendree Spring
were at one timé'part of the Cof-
fee House Circuit.

Smith also helped organize
the National Entertainment
Conference. This is a huge group
of people: there are almost 800
member unions, plus many en-
tertainers. The groupisset up to
help college unions. with
programming by learning how
to deal with professional en-
tertainers. The conference does
block bookings of acts for many
schools.

‘The purpose of the NEC is to
help us get good acts. to get
them cheaply through block
booking. and to help us make
sure the acts show up,” said
Smith.
