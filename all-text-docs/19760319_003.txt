Editors plan three annuals,

‘74-‘75 book available in fall |

By AMANDA HALL
Asst. Sports Editor

Editors are currently work-
ing on three different editions
of the Davidson College Quips
and Cranks.

Zach Long is coordinating
the 1974-1975 book because
Carroll Ensley, the editor,
neglected to finish the book
before graduating. Long ex-
pects the book to be finished
by mid-summer, and will mail
it to the Classes of 1975 and
1976.

The other two classes will be
able to pick up the book in
September when they return
to Davidson.

“T regret that it’s that late,
but we were late getting our
material and I haven’t had
time to do the things I wanted
to do in the book,’’ said Long.
“The students who have been
doing the assignments have
been working since the week
after the material came in.”’

“T thought I'd be further
along on the book than I am.
It’s moving slowly along.”

The copy had to be ready to
send to the printers by the end
of February for the yearbook
to come out this spring. The
staff didn’t receive the mater-
ial until January 10, and six
weeks is not long enough to
put out a good product, ac-
cording to Long.

“In all due respects to
everything that’s been said
about Carroll, he did do some
work on the annual. He had a
basic format and_ sent every-
thing he had to us,’’ said
Long.

According to Long, the
staff’s major problem is the
lack of activity and sports
pictures. There is also little
material from the fraternities

Omitting Saturday as a
study day for Spring term
exams will allow the admini-
stration one day more for
clearing the dormitories,
processing grades, and print-
ing the programs, among
other things, in preparation
for commencement on Sun-
day. .

The SGA Senate passed a
resolution March 16 request-
ing reinstatement of the exam
study days, addition of the
extra day for Christmas break,
and cancellation of classes on
Good Friday. SGA: President
Bo Baskin will take it before

“Carroll had his own ideas
about what he wanted in his
book, and that’s perfectly all
right. If we want to have frat
pictures or activity pictures
we'll have a hard time resur-
recting them because they’re
basically taken by mistake,”’
said Long.

‘‘We have shots in almost
all sports, but in some the
quality is not exactly what we
desired. The tragedy is that
you can’t restage these pic-
tures,’’ he continued.

The staff is asking the
fraternities and individuals for
any pictures they have of the
1974-1975 year.

The senior informal section
has been laid out and some
copy is being written now,
according to Long.

Long asks for student help
preparing the yearbook. ‘‘I’m
particularly pleased with the
work of Alice Rogers, Doris
Phillips, Ron Chappel, Pete
Goodman and Robbie Hutch-
inson have done since we’ve
started working on the annual.
There is still some ‘dirty
work’, that is, typing and
research, to be done, and the
sooner we get some assistants
to help the sooner the book
will be out,” he said.

“The 1975-1976 yearbook is
moving along pretty well right
now,’’ said Randy- Hunter,
editor of the 1975-1976 year-
book.

“But some of the pictures in
the candid section aren’t done
because the photographers
haven’t developed them,” he
continued.

The staff needs to have 78
pages done to meet their first
deadline, April 1. According

Baskin commented, ‘‘Open-

ing Good Friday is simply a

value judgment, this being a

Christian institution. As the
calendar stands now, next
year’s Winter term classes will
havea slight advantage of a
weekend between classes and
exams, something Fall and
Spring will not.”

to Hunter, they will send the
class and faculty pages which
number many more than 78. <

The yearbook does nob have

a specific theme according to
Hunter, but is an all-around
representation of the school
year.
The 1975-1976 yearbook has
nothing in it that will be
censored, according to Hun-
ter. ‘‘Our staff is being re-
sponsible enough not to have
anything in it that should be
censored,’’ he said.

Sue McAvoy and Robbie
Hutchinson, co-editors for the
1976-1977 yearbook have for-
med their staff of editors and
photogiphers.

The’ éditors haven’t chosen
their. prifter yet because, ‘‘It
depends on how much money
we'll be allocated for the
budget. We don’t have our
budget yet so we haven’t been
able to do anything that uses
money,” said McAvoy.

“The only real progress
we've made is forming our
staff because we figure the
best way to go about it is to
set up our editors,’’ she said.
‘We'll be asking for people to
help out not as editors but as
staff next year.”

The 1976-1977 yearbook will
come out in September of
1977, according to McAvoy.

YES, VIRGINIA, there will be a
1974-75 issue of the Quips and

Cranks. But it won't be available
until September, 1976.

The Athletic department
has recently initiated a search

cal education instructor.
Assistant Professor of Phy-
sical Education Chip Stone
expects all applications for the
position to be received by the

The SGA Senate passed a
resolution at its meeting Tues-
day night calling for a traffic
sign to be put on Main Street
to indicate the driveway to the
Davidson College campus.
The resolution passed by a
vote of 13-0.

SGA Senator Carter Todd
introduced the resolution be-
cause of the obscurity of the
driveway, located narrowly
between a private home and a
several-times-dented tree. ‘‘A
