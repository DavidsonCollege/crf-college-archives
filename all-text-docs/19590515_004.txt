dents, the largest classroom to
be shared by both biology and
physics departments. The biolo-
gy department will occupy the.
entire third floor with some
labs on the lower floors.

There will be a limited |
amount of new equipment in
the biology department; most
of the equipment presently in
the Martin Science Building
will be transferred to the new
building.

The Physics Department
will transfer all of its old
desks and equipment to the
first and second floors of the
Dana Science Svuilding, but
new, more complete electrical
services will be installed at
the individual desks.

The nervous system of the
building will be quite complex
with facilities for instantane-
ous release of oxygen, natural
gas, air, and water of varying
temperatures.

It is uncertain whether closed
circuit television installations
will ‘be included. The entire
building will contain air-condi-
tioning. A coaxial cable will
connect the church and Cham-
bers with the Dana Science
Building, this audio cable en-
abling lectures to be heard in
all three buildings simultane-
ously.

lab for radioisotope training in

A new course in physiology
will be open to students next
year with the addition of a
fourth man, Or. T. W. Lam-
mers, a recent graduate of
Emory, to the Biology ‘De-
partment. If is hoped that a
physiology lab will be possi-
ble in the new science buitd-
ing and if so there is a need
for new equipment in this
field.

A special student research
room will be added for the pur-

search, but there will not be
major innovations as far as
electronics and engineering are
concerned.

Spring Trustee Plans

The spring meeting of the Trustees of Davidson Col-
lege, to be held next Thursday, May 21, will have a
special innovation. President D. Grier Martin is arrang-
ing four informal student-faculty-trustee discussion
groups which will explore major phases of Davidson life.

buted to the students and facul-

Continuing an effort for
closer relationship with stu-
dents, the trustees will lunch

“This represents quite a
change,” Mr.. Robert Sailstad,
Assistant to the President, re-
ported. “We feel that it will
have ea very dofinite effect,
though perhaps not immedi-
ate. All three groups are in-
terested in the same things
and this program will offer
an opportunity for exchange
of ideas on key issues.”

The groups are open to any

with the twelve social fra:
ternities. In the past there has
been only a large general
tuncheon. The IFC has given
complete approval and en-
dorsement to the program.

The trustees will have a gen-
eral session preceding the dis-
cussion groups at 10:00 and an-
other in the afternoon at 2:30.
A trustee from each forum will
summarize the discussion and
report on any results.
