ments of the protest came wh en South
African performer-poet Duma Ndlovu

. took the stage. Duma danced and chant-

ed “What.is the way?—Rev—o—lu-
—tion!” He expected the crowd to re-
spond by singing “rev-o-lu-tion” along
with him, but instead they showed

“peace.”

Non-violent and violent factions e-
so collided at the beginning of the dein-
onstration. The Sportacist League, : ‘a
militant communist group excluded: by
the March 27 Coalition, tried'to break
through the prote4st’s security. lines.
Several people were injured i in the.skir-
mish and the camp in to. break up the
fight.

A wall of cops surrounded the Spor-
tacist League and separated them from
the rest of the group. The Sportacists
started shouting “we call for radical vic-
tory — you call the cops.”

Other factions also called for mil-
itary victory by the. salvadoran liftists.
David Christian, a member of the Indus-
triaL Workers of the World, favors
“self-determination for the workers and
peasants.” He feels that “solidarity” will
be the major issue of the 80’s. He also
said that “if I had a crate 38’s, I’d ship it
down to El Salvador so the people could
defend themselves.”

Most of the crowd favored a non-vi-
olent solution, however, Lisa Bambina,

‘amember of Columbia University’ s'Pax

Christi, the Intyernational Catholic
Movement, thinks the US should “pull
out its interests” and seek a “non-vigkesi
means” of resolving the crisis, ©.
CISPES is one of the largest groups
calling for a peaceful resolution. Ac-
cording : 10’ official handouts, the. group
will “join together with others to oppose
the overall Reagan policy of rapidly ex-
panding. militarism and intervention:”
Like all large protests, the crowd
contained a few “cooks.” One man pa-
raded around arguing that “fragging” is
the best solution to the crisis. “Frag-

- ging” is a Viet-nam term that refers to a
soldier assasinating a superior officer.
