Song Earns 68 students on trespassing charges.
Secret Service Scrutiny Campus police in riot gear ini-
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (CPS) - tially blocked students from enter-
A parody rap song titled ““How1 ing the Moffitt Library, but shortly

Killed George Bush” is on the
charts with-a bullet as far as the
Secret Service is concerned.

Alocal record store clerk told
the Minnesota Daily thata’ Secret
Service agent came into the store
and asked him questions about
the song, which is also is the title
of F-kripz’s debut album. The
Secret Service declined to com-
ment.

On Feb. 11, the newspaper
quoted a University of Minne-
sota student who co-founded the
Trap group as saying the song was
not meant to be a political state-
ment,

“We were trying to play off
the themes in rap music,” An-
drew Knighton said. “It’s sort of
a mockery of the ambiguity and
rhetoric that shrouds rap music.
It was like a parody.”

The lyrics include the lines,
“To be all I can be/I’ll kill the p-
r-e-z,/ cause the Sedition Act/
don’t mean a thing to me.”

The album’s promotional
fliers show the President’s pic-
ture underneath the words “Presi-
dent Bush Slain.”

This week the Senate ap-
‘| proved the Minus Grades Ad-Hoc
Committee’s resolution that pro-
poses a revised grade point scale.
This GPA scale, authored by
Senator B.J. Rudell, 95, would
return a portion of the GPA points
lost when the original system
changed. The resolution calls for
further study of the issue of minus
grades, and it encourages faculty
to adjust grading scales so that
minus grades will not devalue
work. It also requests that the ad-
ministration adjust requirements
for honor societies, study abroad
programs and scholarships be-
cause of a possible fall in GPA’s.
The Senate also approved the
Quiet Hours Report that was sub-
mitted last week. As a result of
this report, the Residence Life
Office will distribute a survey
which will ask students if they
want quiet dorms. Students are
encouraged to complete these
survey, in that, because of faculty
intervention in this issue, many
senators are concerned that stu-
dent opinions will not be ex-
pressed. To insure that student’s
voices are heard, the SGA is
encouraging people to contact
their house or class senator or.any

The Athletic Council dis-
cussed future changes that involve
lowering the P.E. requirement for
Varsity athletes and anonymously
surveying underclassmen athletes
so to evaluate the various athletic
programs on campus.

The Senate also discussed
ways to promote understanding of
differences. The F.L.A.G. forum
on February 19 was commended
as well as the efforts of The Har-
mony Committee, a faculty group
that addresses campus tension.
The Harmony Committée is con-
sidering requiring all entering
freshmen to read Waiting for the
Barbarians, a book about the
importance of respect for all
people. This book would then be
discussed by freshmen at orienta-
tion.

- Finally, the Senate created an
Ad-Hoc Committee to review the
proposed alcohol policy with spe-
cific attention to student opinion,
enforceability and specific im-
provements. The committee will
beco-chaired by Prem Manjooran,

Twenty-three senators (including
all of the house senators) volun-
teered to work on the committee.

Professor Speaks on Animal Rights

By Cindy Ebbs

Dr. Lou Pojman, Professor of
Philosophy at the University of
Mississippi, discussed the “Moral
Status of Animals” last Wednes-
day in the Big Screen Room at the
Union.

Pojman based his discussion
on seven theories of the moral
status of animals. To begin, he
posed the following question: “If
itis self-evident that humans have
worth, and there is no demarca-
tion between humans and animals,
what does that say about hu-
mans?”

The first theories he discussed
were the “No Status View”, based
on Descartes view that animals
have no moral rights or moral
status because they have no souls,
and the “Minimal Status Theory”,
based on the ideas of the 19th
century British philosopher Wil-
liam Whewell that we, as humans,
haveno obligation toenhance their
pleasure.

Pojman went on to discuss
the “Indirect Obligation Theory”,

the dominant theory in Western
Philosophy, which states that while
animals have no rights, we should
treat them well because they are
the property of others who do have
moral rights. The Book of Genesis
and the theories of Immanuel Kant,
he'said, also support this claim.

The fourth theory Pojman dis-
cussed was the “Modern Egalitari-
anism: The Equal Consideration
Theory”. Jeremy Bentham, the
“father of classical Utilitarianism”,
first introduced the theory, and
Peter Singer developed it further
in his book, Animal Liberation.
The question in-this theory is not
“can entities reason, as Kant sug-
gests, butcan they suffer,” he said.
According to Pojman, “‘sentience
(the idea that our current treatment
of animals is an act of prejudice)
becomes the hallmark of equal-
ity.”

“Weak Anthropocentrism: The
Split Level Theory” distinguishes
between trivial needs and impor-
tant needs in that it says that hu-
mans are of more inherent worth

SGA Phonathon Raises

By Tom Koonce

For the past two weeks over
500 Davidson students partici-
pated in the 1992 SGA Phonathon.
Several members of each house,
as well as many freshmen and
independents, called Alumni and
students’ parents in an effort to
raise money for the Davidson
Annual Fund.

The total number of pledges
received was 1,850. These in-
cluded people who said they
would give but did not state a
specific amount. The total amount
of money raised was around
$168,000. Rusk, Fijiand Spencer

called the first night of the
Phonathon and solicited the most
amount of money for any night at
SAE’s total of 367
pledges was the highest pledge
total for the two weeks.
Although this year’s
Phonathon did not generate as
much money as in.years past, it
was more effective in reaching
people who might not have given
in a while to pledge money to
Davidson. All of the best alumni
prospects had already given in the
fall in other fundraising efforts, so
this year’s SGA Phonathon was
more analogous to a clean-up

alties for those who violate this policy; and
8. To establish a “rush” program which will change the expecta-
tions of the freshman class about the appropriate ways to socialize at

Davidson.

The r¢port lists new regulations for the general college, residence
halls, and Patterson Court. Thechanges for Patterson Court are the most
stringent, but Dean Terry said they are necessary because of the current
North Carolina law on alcohol consumption. He said, “ The law is the
fundamental problem. If we didn’t have the law we would not have the
problem we have now and if we did have the problem we could solve
it without having to take these kinds of measures.”

The proposed policy states that persons of legal-drinking age may
bring only one container of alcohol from the service area. It also rec-
ommends that the number of kegs be limited at parties and the alcohol
service stop at 11:30pm on weekdays and 1:30am on weekends. The
alcohol policy also contains an appendix concerning rush which lists
regulations on when freshmen can go to court parties and the length of
time that rushing will take place. In this proposed policy, freshmen may
not attend ‘wet’ parties on the court during the first semester,

Dean Terry said that he believes students can'come up with good

ideas and suggestions to meet the objectives of the alcohol policy. He _ Professional organizations. ~

said, “Students can creatively come up with a sound policy if they are
willing to spend the brain power to doit. That’s what I want them todo,
but if they can’t do that then we’ll have to move in other directions.”

tional comments from Dean Terry please turn to the Back Page Inter-

than animals. Pojman explained
that “an importanthuman need can
trump an important need of an
animal, but a trivial human need
cannot override a trivial animal
need.”

Radical Egalitarianism put
animals and humansatequal worth,
he said. Supporters of this theory
are philosopher Tom Regan and
the animal rights group People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals
(PETA).

The last theory Pojman dis-
cussed was the Super-Egalitarian-
ism Theory which holds that “all
life is sacred.” He said that this
theory “lends nicely to an environ-:
mental ethic.”

Pojman himself isa vegetarian
because he would like to reduce
the amount of unnecessary suffer-
ing which the animals go through
in animal factories, for health rea-
sons, and to prevent the loss of |
energy value in the food chain. He
believes that it is our “general duty
to not cause unnecessary harm” to
animals.
