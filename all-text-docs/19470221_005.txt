N. C. STATE SATURDAY

The most imminent speculation as the old

Wildcat tilt with North Carolina Tuesday, and
the second fracas with the Hoosier Hot Shots of
State College Saturday night.

will be to stop the scoring of North Carolina’s
Jim Hamilton and Bob Paxton, two of the gentle-
men who previously engineered a Phantom vic-

tory over the Wildcats.

Friday and since Wake Forest. tossed a bomb
shell into conference standings by beating N. C.
State, this game is a must for Davidson if the
quintet expects to be present when the Southern
Conference Tourney roll is called up yonder.
Sooth saying: Davidson by 5 points in the final

tally.

N. C. State, still sitting on second place in the loop
rating, poses the second question mark which should
explode into a cat victory Saturday night in Raléigh.
The Hoosiers will be no light work-out, but your colum-
nist’s faith in the Red and Black Cagers is unshaken,
despite the Clemson trimming. As usual, Dick Dickey,

Mat Team Goes
To Tournament

Wrestling fans will have their
last chance to see the Wildcat grap-
plers in action this season when the
’Cats face Washington and Lee in
the Gym tomorrow afternoon. In-
dications are that the Generals have
a potent aggregation which may
provide the best home match of
the team.

The only available yardstick for
comparison is the result of the two
teams’ encounters ‘with Carolina.
Davidson lost all its matches except
one, which Carolina forfeited, with
the Tar Heels making many pins.
The Generals also dropped every
bout but Carolina took two by fall
while the other six were close deci-
sions. This would indicate that W.

Davidson will

land and should stop the terrors by 8 points.

In reminiscing over the Clemson defeat we
may only blush with weak comment of “A bit
over-confident,” and let it go at that. But the
come back over Furman looked good with George
Peters flashing a brand of ball characteristic of
pre-war days. Dick Mills, reserve freshman,
came considerably up the ladder playing a fine
floor game and stabbing rebounds relentlessly.

JAY VEES

The Jay Vee game preliminary to the varsity Citadel
scrap, saw the Wildkittens, paced by Heywood Brine-
gar’s 17 points, beat Pheiffer in a fast game. Red Bennet,
scoring leader in the N. C. Junior College Conference

paced the losers with 20 points for high scoring honors

Bennett made good 12 of the 16 free throws he was a-

warded.

SPORTS EDITORSHIP CHANGES HANDS

After many nights of endless typewritter
pounding until his fingers are worn to the nub,
your sports editor has finally succumbed, and in
keeping with the trend is resigning his post. Tak-
ing over this coveted position, however will be
one of skill and ability, SAM ERVIN. Sam came
to Davidson in 43 and immediately became as-
sociated with the sporting activities of the Col-
lege. That year he was official school statistician
keeping tab on all the records. Next season, be-
ing journalisticly inclined he served a term on the
henored staff of the Davidsonian, writing of
sports activities, and acting as general literary
aid. Entering service shortly thereafter, he re-
mained with the Army until September of 46, find-
ing hie way back to Davideon in the nick of time

to register.

And so, friends, players, fans, and students I bid
you farewell with best wishes to my successor.

Betas And PhiGams Hold Lead
Four In Tie For Third Place

Th Betas and the Phi’Gams were
still clinging on to their Interfrat
leads as this week started. The
Betas rolled over the Pikas to the
tune of 23 points, winning 38-15.
The same week, the Phi Gams roll-
ed up their fifth win by taking
the Phi Delts, 38-23. In second
place were the S. A.-E.’s, who last
week downed the Pi Kapps in a
25-15 battle. This is the way the
top teams line up.

In third place were four teams,
and it seems to be pretty much of a
toss up as to which one will finally
grab the place for himself. The
K. A.’s came through to defeat the
Independents, ahead of them last
week, 35-29. . Now both teams have
an even .500.average. winning and
losing three game apiece. In the
same boat were the S. P. E.’s, who

put the Kappa Sigs even deeper in
the cellar with a 44-27 victory. Also
in the running were the Pi Kapps,
who lost to the S. A. E.’s.

In the cellar, so to speak, wére
the Phi Delts who downed the
Kappa Sigs last week, and are now
standing 1-5. The Pikas and the
Kappa Sigs were not much’ worse
off, the former with no wins and
five losses, while the Pikas also
had no wins, but six losses.

Going into-this -wek-of play, the

Ga. Tech and Auburn Take Wins

The Cats returned last Sunday
from* an unsuccessful road trip
which included frays with Ga. Tech
and Auburn.

Tech, which had eeked out a 20-18
win here a few weeks ago, turned
on the steam Thursday to take the
return bout 28-15. Jung, fighting
in the 121 lb. class, won his second
match in two searts by pinning
Chandler, Rufus Long, 136, fol-
lowed Jung’s example by downing
his man and “Bull” Alexander made
it a threesome by pinning Moore.

Other results were: Geisler (T)

decisioned Stroup; Andrews (T)
pinned Cox; Batten (T) pinned
Price; Donaldson (T) pinned

Thompson; Bassed (T) pinned Eas-
ley.

Encountering Auburn, Jung
again paved the way. with a pin,
but the Wildcats failed to follow
suit, and Auburn copped the re-
maining events with 5 pins and 2
decisions bringing the final score
to 31-5.

Grid Eleven

The sound of leather and body

contact is heard again at Richard-
son Field as Coach Bill Story con-
ducts early spring practice for a
squad of about 44 hopefuls. Pros-
pects for next year’s eleven look
good, but Coach Story has been
handicapped by the loss of some of
his stalwarts to the baseball, bas-
ketball and track squads.

year’s squad and J. V. team can

for these departing men so that
when the whistle blows for the
opening game this autumn, David-
son should find a well balanced and
potent eleven. Bob Walker, a J. V.
blocking back is looking good at the
blocking back post as is Dick Rich-
ards. At th ends, Mapes, Blanks,
and Bill Johnson head the list. A
newcomer to the backfield is vet-
eran Buck Williams, an all state
back while at the University of
South Carolina in 1943.

Coach Story has divided his squad
into two teams, the Reds and the
Greens with two practice games so
far. The Red team has emerged
victorious both times by a 6-0 score.
In the first game Cifford seored
on a reverse ten yards from pay
dirt. In the two passes

ball and lugged it some forty yards
to the ten yard marker. A few
plays later the pass play

Clemson Tiss Upset
Davidson By 57-53

The Clemson Tigers upset the
Wildcats, 57 to 53, last week to win
their first Southern Conference
basketball victory of the season.

Unable to match the Clemson
quint during the first half the Cats
went to the dressing room at the
inter mission leaving a Clemson lead
of 27 to 28 on the scoreboard. Back
from a short rest the two teams
played exactly even terms in the
second stanza as Clemson held its
four-point margin to the finish.

Cheek High Man

Standout for the night was rangy
Buddy Cheek. Playing his usual
floor game plus a dead basket eye
he vacked up 20 points for the
night’s high score; White was next
with 10 as Peters pushed for a close
second high with 9.

Cats Wop Citadel
“B’s” Down Pheiffer

Hitting on all five despite erratic
passing, Davidson’s Wildcats put
the whip to The Citadel’s Bulldogs
Tuesday night at the Armory, 72
to 46 in a Southern Conference
game witnessed by a crowd of about
1,000. The Davidson Jayvees de-
feated Pheiffer College, 75 to 44,
in the opener of the doubleheader.

Citadel started with a bang and
the blue clad Bulldogs led for a
few minutes. Davidson went ahead
7-6, but Citadel tied it at 10-10 and
then 12-12 before the Wildcats
struck their stride. Then, with
George Peters rolling them in, Ed
White flipping long ones and
George Cheek hitting from all
angles, the Wildcats forged ahead
and held a 37-27 lead at halftime.

The was slow.
Coach Norman Sheppard pulled his
varsity after a few minutes of the
second half and let his second
take over. The Cats
scored 35 points in this half as the
Bulldogs, baffled by Davidson's
tricky shifting zone defense, could

not get inside the Presbyterian
circle.
The Citadel players failed to

break fast enough and allowed the
Davidson defense to get set. - The
Wildcats tossed the ball about with
abandon, but the marksmen were
hitting them from all angles and
made some remarkable shots.

Peters paced the Wildcats, scor-
ing with 17, followed by Cheek’s 16
and White’s 15. Affie Dufour with
14 led the Bulldog’s, coached by
Whitey Piro, who played with the,.
Third Air Foree Gremlin football
team at Morris Field here in 1944.
John Wimberly was next with 11.

TENNIS

With Coach Luffler still on
tour with the Pros, the netmen
have met only in impromptu
sessions to warm up and shake
out the winter crinks, but talent
is shining. Buck Archer, Whit
Cobb, Lenoir Keesler, Ted Kees-
ler, Jerry Robinson, and Bo
Roddy are a mixture of old and
new talent that should spark the
