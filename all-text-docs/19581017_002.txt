Success of Honor Council Depends
On Election Procedure Adopted

After a good bit of legislative
pushing and pulling. the Student
Council has come up with a workable
plan for an Honor Council.

There seems to be little ground
for disagreement on the fact that a
separation of the present Council in-
to a judicial and a legislative body
should result in distinct benefit to
the Student Body. Each group could
concentrate activities in their particu-
lar field. and not have to be spread,
as is now the case, over a wide range
of duties.

The permanent status given to
elected Honor Council members
would relieve them of anv pressures
that a representative. elected annual-
lv might feel. This permanency
could further insure a number of ex-
perienced hands on the Honor Coun:
.cil at all times.

Too often in the past, due to in-
experience. an unsatisfactory under-
standing of purpose, or too many dit-
ties. the Student Body has suffered
with an inept and incompetent Stw-
dent. Council. This measure could
spell deliverance from such burdens
in the future.

On one: point. of the proposal the
Student Council could not decide—
just hew to elect the members of the
proposed Honor Council. Herein lies
the inevitable flaw, for the election of

this group is the key to its success
of failure.

Two proposals will be submitted
in regard to election procedtire. One
will provide for a committee of facul-
ty and Student Council members
which will make nominations to the
Student Body, to which list the Stu-
dent Body will have an opportunity to
add any names desired. The second
plan provides only for nominations
from the Student Body.

It is imperative for the success
of the entire plan that the first pro-
posal be adopted. It will thereby be
insured that many hours of careful
thought will go into the selection of
nominees. The adoption of the direct
nomination system can only mean
that we will be furnished with an-
other popularity contest in which
campus politicians can flex their vote
getting muscles.

It should be pointed out that the
committee system of nominations will
not preclude nominations by the Stu-
dent Body. It will insure that much
careful thought will go into the se-
lection of men for positions in a body
of such great importance as an Honor
Council.

The DAVIDSONIAN urges the
Student Body to accept the proposed
Honor Council plan, and to accept it
with the committee system of nomina-
tions.

Frat Retreats

Arising from recent discussions
around campus has been an idea that
could develop into a very fruitful de-
vice for increasing the vatues and
meaning of brotherhood in the David-
son: fraternities.

Much discussion ‘was devoted to
the subject at the YMCA Retreat last

weekend, and the representatives of .

all fraternities present wholehearted-
ly agreed that the idea of fraternity
retreats might well be a medium
through which the Greeks can better
tackle their problems with mature in-
sights.

Although the seed for the idea was
sown primarily in YMCA gatherings
that by no means is to be the cue for
anyone to ball the idea right off the
bat.

A typical retreat would. require
around twelve or fifteen sincerely in-
terested brothers in a fraternity de-
voting a weekend during the year and
going to a spot away from‘the schol-
astic run-around of Davidson where
they could better deliberate. A por-
tion of the weekend might be set
aside for individual study of school
work if the brothers so desired. The
primary portion of the retreat would
be devoted to dissecting, illuminating,
and attempting to solve critical prob-
lems of the chapter, which might in-
clude pledge training, higher regard
for the Ritual, alumni relations, con-
duct at social functions. and the like.
Other portions of the retreat may be
devoted to general bull sessions and
discussion of miscellaneous matters.

As participants in the Y Cabinet
retreats have discovered, a weekend
away from the pressures of the cam-
pus provides a perfect atmosphere for
a group to grow closer together in
understanding and mutual accomp-
lishment, an atmosphere which is con-
ducive to mature endeavors toward
mature goals. Only through active
participation in such a retreat can
a student fully appreciate the benefits
reaped. All those who have experi-
enced this in the past would urge a

sincere inquiry into such a project
by every fraternity on campus.

And Alcohol

By recent action, the faculty has
attempted to beef up its rule prohibit-
ing the possession of firearms in Col-
lege dormitories. This actions is com-
mendable, but lacks any suitable
means of enforcement, and this is one
rule, at least. which must be enforced.

Student opinion must be brought
around to an attitude which will dis-
courage anyone risking the keeping of
a weapon in his room. The most feasi-
ble method for effecting such an at-
titude, and of insuring proper en-
forcement is the fashioning of a Stu-
dent Body Regulation prohibiting the
possession of firearms in a dormitory
or in an automobile.

The adoption of such a regulation
would make all members of the Coun-
cil “honor bound” to report all vio-
lators. and call on members of the
Student Body at large to feel “duty
bound” to report men who persisted
in keeping weapons in their possesion.

The DAVIDSONIAN realizes ‘that
there are some students who are in-
terested in hunting, and thereby have
a reason for keeping firearms at
school. Some arrangement should.
and we think could, be worked out
to provide a place in which to lock
their weapons when not in use. How-
ever not even the hunters should, un-
der anv conditions, be allowed to keep
guns or rifles in their possesion, ex-
cept when off campus and engaged in
hunting. °

Some Student Council members,
including President Kuykendall have
protested, when asked about the pos-
sibility of Council action in this mat-
ter, that it might result in ‘“spread-
ing the Council too thin.” At present,
the Council is required to report stu-

dent possession of only one item —
“alcoholic liquors”.

We ask President John and the
Council one question: What is more
dangerous in a dorm room — a bot-
tle of bourbon whisky or a .38 pistol?

Tragic experience provides the
only possible answer.

No Heresy On

The Hill

Scriptures . . . Only Infallible Rule

Oath Required Of Professors

Since Davidson is owned and
partially supported’ by the Pres-
byterian Church in the United
States. since about half of its
students and a very large num-
ber (perhaps a majority) of its
atimni are Presbyterians, and
because of its peculiar history
and traditions. it is inevitable
that the Davidson faculty should
consist mainly of Presbyterians,
and that the rules and regula-
tiens governing the faculty
should reftect these conditions
and be slanted in this direction.

But the exact nature of
these rules, important as

they are, is largely un-
known to students and
alumni. Their importance

in determining the quality
and characteristies of the
faculty, along with their in-
direct influence on what is
taught in the classroom,
merits close examination of
them as they now stand.

To begin with. the President
of Davidson College must be a
Presbyterian, and if he is not
already a Southern Presbyte-
rian he must change his mem-
bership before he takes office
permanently, As it is stated in
the Charter and By-Laws of the
Trustees of Davidson College
(with revisions to February 19.
1958). Part I. Article IV, Para-
graph 81, this rule reads: “No
person shall be eligible for elec-
tion as President of Davidson
College unless he is a member
of the Presbyterian Church and’
he shal! not be eligible for
inauguration unless he is a
member’ of the Presbyterian
Church in the United States.”

“EVANGELICAL”

In this same section it is sta-
ted that “No person shall be
eligible for inauguration as pro-

fessor unless he is 2 member
of some evangelical chureh an
All instructors, assistant pro-
fessors and associate profes-
sors who have not been inaugu-
rated must be.members of same
evangelical church.”

The major denominations are
included. but such groups as
the Unitarians. who deny many
of the doctrines regarded as
“evangelical,” are ineligible to
teach at Davidson. Jews. and be-
religions, as
well as atheists and agnostics...
are, of course, excluded.

That a heavy majority of
Presbyterians will occupy
the positions on the faculty
with the highest pay and
the most prestige is in-
sured by the next rule: “At
no time shall there be more
than one-fourth of the in-
augurated professors who
are not members of some
branch of the Presbyterian
Church.”

An additional requirement
exists for two particular depart-
ments: “The professors of Bi-
ble and Philosophy shall in all
instances be members of some
branch of the Presbyterian
Church . .. . And inasmuch as
the departments of Bible and
Philosophy deal with matters
which are directly related to
the doctrines of our Reformed
Faith. the Trustees of Davidson
College affirm their conviction
that professors in the depart-
ments of Bible and Philosophy,
in addition to the vow of com-
mitment to Evangelical Chris-
tianity, enter into agreed com-
mitment to the doctrines of the
Reformed Faith as they are set
forth in the standards of the
Presbyterian Church in the
United States . . . . If any

person. not an elder or a dea-
con in the Presbyterian Church.
be elected professor cither in
Bible or Philosophy, he shalf
have put to him,the same ques-
tions required of candidates for
ordination as elder.”
INAUGURAL VOWS

Finally, it is stated: ‘‘Inas-
much as. Davidson College.
which is an institution of the
Presbyterian Church in the
United States. regards itself
and is regarded as a teaching
arm of the Chiirch, the Board
of Trustees has reaffirmed the
conviction that all teaching be
done ‘in the light of the Chris:
tian faith, and that commitment
to evangelical: Christianity. be
publicly affirmed as a part of
the inaugural vows of. a profes-
sor at Davidson.”

This “commitment = to
evangelical Christianity”
required of each full pro-
fessor during the annual
Commencement, at which
time the professor being in-
augurated “shall be re-
quired to give affirmative
answers” to the following
cath, to be administered
publicly by the President
of the Board of Trustees:

a “Do you acknowledge
Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior
and do you believe in the fun-
damental teachings of evange-
lical Christianity?

b “Do you believe the scrip-
tures of the Old and New Testa-
ments to be the word of God.
the only infallible rule of faith.
and practice?

¢c. “Do you promise in humble
reliance upon the grace of God,
which comes by the Holy Spirit,
so to live and teach as to give
expression to the Christian
faith?”

Oath or Orthodoxy
A Timely Fable

By TOM KERNAN

I was sitting on the library steps the other day, idly"

diy

smoking and observing a team of landscapers at work
on a new memorial grape arbor, when my scholarly class-
mate, Harvey Drudge, joined me.

“I’ve run across a fascinating bit of history,” he said.
“Found it while doing research on a paper; I'd like you

to hear it.”

*

I was hardly overcome by wild enthusiasm at the
prospect but I could tell that Harvey was excited (like
the time he thought his average was up to 3.6) and that

there was no escaping him.

Oddly enough, I found his tale appropriate in the

light of certain current issues and have decided to share .

it with the rest of you.

“It chanced that in the days of King Kautious, called
Kautious the Kraven, the high priest, Prejudiced VI,
learned of certain disloyal subjects who went about .
preaching heresy against the great god Dogma. The high
priest went to the King and said, ‘My Lord, certain evil
men in the land are going about uttering slander against
our god, Dogma. Soon the land will be filled with heretics
who no longer follow the faith of our fathers, and then
they will turn upon thee and destroy thee, yea down
to the last hair on thy chinney-chin-chin.”

“Upon hearing this, King Kautious waxed exceeding -

wroth and smote his breast and that of the high priest as
well. And so it came to pass that the King called a coun-
cil of the Trustiest, so named because it could always be
trusted to propagate the wishes of the great god Dogma.

“Now this was a council of the wisest and wealthiest
men {although wealth was no factor in their selection,
but only their wisdom since, being men who lived at a
great distance from the kingdom, their minds were un-
cluttered by facts or proximity to the kingdom and were

filled only with thoughts of an abstract nature.)”
“And thus it came to pass that the council devised

a method to stop the tongues of heretics. Messengers of
the King went throughout the kingdom. and, upon find-
ing a heretic, they would force him to eat a noxious sub-
stance which so deformed his tongue that all he could
say thereafter was the name of great god Dogma: And
this substance is known as ‘‘Oathmeal” and is the most
noble of all the foods because of its service to the god.”

THE PHILOSOPHES

Every peart cast is strung on

a different necklace. Every nug-
get refined is dropped again in-
to a different mine. to be re-
processed. Each thought trans-
mitted {rom an individual to
a group is fitted into a differ-
ent pattern by each one who
hears. This is one of the chief
difficulties faced by any speak-
er who endeavors to deliver a
speech to any audience.

MISCONCEPTION

A word. a thought, which is
but an aspect of a larger pat-
tern, spoken out of a more com-
plex whole. when expressed
without a precedent delineation
of this whole, may become dis-
proportionately conceived by
those who hear it expressed.

An aspect tends to be magni-
fied at the expense of the whole

Members Defend ‘Y’ Budget Against Critic

Dear Editor:

Last week one of the focal
columnists did in writing what
others may have been doing be-
hind the scenes—he questioned
some figures in the Y budget.
Perhaps the query was out of
sincere interest; perhaps it just
provided readable copy for a
previous void in the column;
nevertheless, the Y budget in-

__ vites closer inspection.

The purpose of the Y budget
is not the standard one to which
common budgets are dedicated:
setting up a costs and receipts
equation for maximum = = and
most efficient operation. It is
rather more a suggestion than
a limit to various expenses.

There are particular com-
ments about several items
which are necessary to explain
their budgeted allowance.

Membership and Gift Fund
($250)—these expenses are for
mailing the handbooks to fresh-
men, buying and mailing Orien-

tation copies of the INTERCOL-
LEGIAN, printing membership
cards and solicitation cards.

Automobile Depreciation
($475)—this figure may look
high, but it was only by the
provision of the same figure in
years past that the Y. was able
to buy a replacement for the
car totally wrecked a year ago.
This should be a yearly adjust-
ed figure, but this past year,
having no money in the depre-
ciation account, it was felt prop-
er to continue the figure sup-
ported in the past.

Literature and the INTER-
COLLEGIAN (S70) — Much of
this can be laid to the operation
of the activities of the spiritual
concerns of the YMCA, and its
figure is legitimately a part of
the Spiritual Life and Fellow-
ship programs.

Discretionary Fund ($250) —
There are two uses of this fund.
The first is the standard one of
anticipating some Y  depart-

ments spending more than their
budget, as occurred this year
when Wildcat Handbook  cx-
penses exceeded the allotted
amount by about $70. The sec-
ond is to anticipate the im-
mediate opportunities which
arise, but are not in the bud-
get. such as last year’s offering
to Madras Christian College,
which included an entire Ves-
per offering.

Social Life ($100) — This is
lower than it has been in past
years, but by its nature it in-
curs several traditional obliga-
tions, such as the expensive
Davidson-Queens freshman
dance, which more properly are
legitimate responsibilities of
other organizations. Its program
(freshman dance, exchange
days. dance weekend social
functions, ete.) is such that its
$100 is a minimum.

The Spiritual Life and Fel-
lowship Commissions ($100 to-

gether) are new in reSponsibil-
ity this year. They are charged
with implementing a core group
challenge that the YMCA has
accepted. Their probable ex-
penses are undefined, but prob-
ably low, since much of their
material will be covered by the
budget of other items.

Such inquiries into the ex-
penses of the Y are very worth-
while, that the Y. member may
know how his money is being
dispersed. In this limited space,
all the facets of the Y budget
cannot be outlined, but it is
hoped that this has provided a
better insight, into the opera-
tions of the second biggest
body on campus.

(Incidentally, Dr. C. E. Rat-
liff, who has been known to dis-
play some knowledge of eco-
nomics, is chairman of the
YMCA Board of Directors.)

EASIEST TO IGNORE

There are more than these
(truisms), but these seem to be
the easiest to ignore. Their
importance and gravity are bul-
bously enlarged when the
speaker is a preacher, the au-
dience a congregation, and the
matter of thought and com-
munieation religion.

A preacher today must speak
out of at least the unity of
conscience to a diversity of in-
dividuals, among whom those
are concerned about religion
and the quest after a meaning-
ful one are concerned in as
many manners as there-are ‘in-
dividuals. Thus are the two ini-
tial. precipices made more
sheer. the task of the preacher
more severe.

DR. NEWELL

On Sunday, October 5, in the
Davidson College Vesper Ser-
vice, Dr. S. W. Newell was
acutely faced with these diffi-
culties. In seeking to deal with
man’s making of God in man’s
own image, Dr. Newell assumed
a structure of complexity the
explication of which is too vast
for one man to undertake in
the course of a single sermon.

The particular interpretation
of God, the particular “image
of man,” that Dr. Newell pre-
sented and refuted was not
necessarily the only one avail-
able for man’s artifaction.
While Dr. Newell's approach
left the middle-class deity no
chance to par the. eighteenth
hole, there were still questions
unanswered, gods unshattered.
And this is my point.

NOT ALL ANSWERS

It seems that we must not
look to one sermon for all the
answers, we ought not expect
to discover with facility what
men have been searching for
in the agony of faith for cen-
turies. (Nor should we, in
recognizing this, discard the
value of the cumulative possi-
bility.)

Just as the man behind the
collar must strive daily to com-
municate what are probably to
him still flexible messages, so
it seems must we seek to thread
the beads, instead of swallow-
ing one bead at a time under
the illusion that in so doing
the change is made, the “over.
whelming questions” answered.
