The Wreckers of Autumn

Ah, the sounds of autumn beginning: flyers for the
freshman senate flitting on doors, tow trucks towing, the
crack of football helmets on Saturday morn, tow trucks
towing, students scurrying in and out of the library like.
squirrels hiding nuts, tow trucks towing, students with
wet hair rushing to class, tow trucks towing as summer
ebbs away and we wonder: justhow much money are the
towing dudes at Texaco actually making this year?

But, the enforcement seems good for the campus.
After all, illegal parking is probable cause for death in
some countries. Davidson head-people are even think-
ing of adding an extra day to the calendar, which would
create more hours to tow vehicles.

In the meantime, take some time to reflect on the
fading summer. Sit yourself under a sugar maple and
keep an eye out for one of the towing dudes at Texaco in
his new red Lambourghini whirring down Main Street,
waving at you and smiling, then rounding a corner, and
flooring it down a side road to his new home on his new

lake:

If you see him, wave back.

Window Dressers to the Rescue

To the Editor:

Inlight of the recent flap
over printing student direc-
tories, the window dressers
in College Relations thought
we’d see if we could help
out. We found that we can
download student informa-
tion from the PRIME, refor-
mat it on our Mac and have
it ready to copy in Central
Services with a minimum of
time and money. We’ve
never done this before, nor
been asked to but there is
clearly a need for this serv-

ice and we are glad to help
meet that need.

In order to expedite
matters and to keep the
amount of paper used to a
minimum, we will publish
only student name, campus
address and campus phone
number. We may also use
very small type tosave space.

We will have it copied two

sides, collated and stapled,
then deliver one toeach resi-
dence hall orapartmentroom
and one to all faculty and
staff. Those who wish to do
so can make extra copies on

their own after that.

This will be only an in-
tcrim student directory. We
will still publish the un-
abridged and unexpurgated
college directory in October
(the earliest we can pull all
the information together and
getin printed). If this works
out we will continue thisnew
service every year from here
on out.

Voting Privileges for
International Students?

The prominent issue in
the lasttwoS.G.A. meetings
has been whether or not the
International Representative
should be given voting
priveleges at S.G.A. mect-
ings. Last week at-the Sep-
tember 4th meeting, after
consulting the By-Laws,
Student Body President
Doug Jobe informed the
Senate that the international
students would have to at-
tainacharter from the school,
thus becoming a social or-
ganization in order to gain
the right to vote.

Independent Senator
Prem Manjooran saidachar-
ter was the last thing the
international students
wanted since it would only
encourage further social
divisionand segregation. He
did, however, hope that the
Senate couldreform the By-
Laws to include a voting
international representative.

First some background °

information.

Currently the interna-
tional representative is cho-
sen by the International
Committee, a function of the
College Union. The repre-
sentative sits in on S.G.A.

mectings and sends the -
committee a report. The
position was created last year
in an attempt to further inte-
grate international students.

All international  stu-
dents are either independ- —
ents or affiliated with an
eating house and thus, thco-
retically, fully represented
in the S.G.A. I have, how-
ever, spoken with several
international students who
felt that the current system
did not fully represent their
interests, They and I feel that
theinternational community
at Davidson has_ special
needs which deserve specific
representation.

Because all three inde-
pendent senators are cur-
rently international students
some would argue that the
international community is,
ifanything, overrepresented,
Independent senators, how-
ever, serve all independents,
not just their own peer group.

The international commu- ~

nily still lacks a. specific
voice, and I believe this
should change,
International students
face problems. which no
other students at Davidson

must face. For example, a

friend of mine from Nepal
took A-level examinations
in secondary school. These
tests are unique to the Brit-
‘ish educational system and

are prepared for throughout
the last two years of the U.S.
equivalent of high school.

I spent my junior year
in England and prepared for
A-levels in several subjects
and also took some A.P. tests
in high school andcan vouch
that A-levels are more diffi-
cult. Last year my friend
spoke with the registrar
about recieving credit for
these courses and is still
waiting to find an answer.

Issues like these make
me think that the interna-
tional students needa voting
representative of their own.

The only way toachieve
this without the formation of
a new international student
social organization is a re-
form of the By-Laws,

‘believe thisissuc needs
immediate $.G.A. attention.
If you agree please speak

~ with your §.G.A. represen-

tative, that’s what the S.G.A.
is for.
