Out Win Over Frosh
In Overtime, 72-70

By BILL FARRICR

The Wildkittens held a five-point
led at the end Of the first half only
to have it taken from them early in
the third quarter. From that point
on it was a nip and tuck ball game,
the difference in scores seldom
being more than one point. ‘The
game time ran out with the frosh
in possession of the ball and the
score knotted up at 62 all.

In the closing minutes of the
overtime period the Kittens were
behind, 69-72, when Vance received
two free throws as the result of a
foul. He sank his first shot and in
a futile attempt, tried to bounce h:s
second off the back board in order
160 gam one more shot at the basket.
Wingate. however, gained posses
sion of the ball and the game ended
at this voint.

Garaham and King were high
scorers for the Kittens with 17 and
16 points, respectively. Gordon, of
Wingate, lead both teams with 27
points.

Strong VMI Defeats
Matmen Handily 21-3

By BILL BROOKS

Davidson’s grapplers played host
to V.M.I.’s Keydets last Friday aft-
ernoon and came out on the short
end of a 21-3 count. However, all
was not so dark as the score would
indicate. For instance, the . 128-
pound conference champ edged out
Johnny Kelton by a 5-4 decision.
The match was even at 44 in
wrestling points, but the Keydet
had a minute more “riding time,”
thus winning. Last year this same

boy pinned Kelton handily, so if}.

past performances mean anything
one might look for a victory for
Johnny in® the conference meet to
be held March 6, ‘at Maryland.

Hal Haynes won his match,
skunking his foe by a 4-0 decision.
Good boy! Our only victory for
the day, so Hal saved us from a
shut-out.

Biggest “let-down” was that ap-
plied to Mac McNeeley, Davidson's
“Georgeous George.” This was Big
Mac’s first conference defeat (also
his first season) so great things
may. well be expected from him
before Davidson turns him loose on
the cold, cold world. A little more
experience and he should be un-
beatable.

In the other matches, Dan Bell
lost 8-2, Pendleton by 16-7, Covell
by 8-1, Price by 9-1, and Alexander
by 5-1. There was one saving grace,
even in this defeat, though. No-
body was pinned.

By JOE THIGPEN

With only three more home
games, one of the school’s finest
basketball players - and athletes,
Whit Cobb, is nearing the *con-
clusion of a brilliant collegiate
sports career, —

Known for his sportsmanship,

‘and integrity, as well as his ability,

the lithe, 150-pound three-sport

Tletterman is recognized as the best

defensive guard in the conference,
despite his lack of size and a ham-
pering asthmatic condition.

An All-State selection the last
two years, the former Durham
High school star probably will not
make as many points this year
as last season when he led the
league’s guards in scoring, but” is
improving his scoring with every
contest and has averaged 11 points
per game for the last two weeks to
bolster his standing among the top
scorers in his position.

However, his leadership of a team
composed of totally inexperienced
players has been almost as note-
worthy as his individual defensive
ability when assigned to guard the
opposition’s high scorer. His
smoothness and speed is best illus-
trated by a surprisingly low foul
mark of only 1.2 per contest.

the Presbyterian captain as a guid-
ing light, saying that, “it is im-
possible to overestimate the ability
of Whit.”

‘The quiet, steady, fast-moving
team leader is the type of player
that would ordinarily escape atten-
tion, but the slim, clever ball hand-
ler is usually the crowd’s favorite
wherever he plays, not only for his
spectacular floor play and general-
ship, but also for good sports-
manship.

The newspapers and their ever-
observant sportswriters join with
opposing players and coaches in
glowing reports. The Durham Sun,
probably thinking of the game this
year in which Whit allowed Duke's
high-scoring ace, Dick Groat, to
make only’ one field goal instead
of his average 18 points, said: “He
(Cobb) is undoubtedly the confer-
ence’s best defensive man.” This
was exemplified by another fine
demonstration against UNC when
Hugo Kappler, selected by the Da-
vidson coach as their biggest threat
had to settle for two buckets for
a game's efforts. In addition to his
solid defense, Whit has consistent-
ly been one of the best long set shot
artists in the loop, always being
good for three or four long dis-
tance hits a game.

Against N. C. State, in ther
initial clash, Dick Dickey was only
able to get a half-dozen points,
while in the second game with the
Wolfpack, it was the 21-year-old

three minutes to go, Cobb covered
Ranzino this time, and big Sammy
had his average cut in half, throw-
ing in only 10 points under the
Davidson guard's surveillance.

The Winston-Salem Sentinel car-
ried a large photo of the Cat cap-
tain last week, labeling it, “the
most underrated basketball play
in the conference.”

The Charlotte Observer speaks
of Whit as a 40-minute veteran who
is aS competent a guard as you
will likely find, pointing out that
he is the steadying influence that
keeps the team from falling apart.

The Durham Herald spoke of
Whit as “one of the finest col-
legiate athletes to come from Dur-
ham.” It pointed out a fact that
few folks knew — Whit was a re-
gular T-f tion quarterback on
the Bull football team and
did a highly commendable job.

An officer m his fraternity, a
leader in campus circles, and a
good student, Whitlock was elected
overwhelmingly to the presidency
of the student body, highest un-
dergraduate honor.

Whit is the nephew of one of
the South’s greatest cagers, John
Fobb, an all-time All-American
who played on North Carolina’s
national championship team of
1924.

Whit's acts of sportsmanship have

did} more times than tainted money.
} Fhe SAE's held a 22-20 half-time

ma Chi's with 13 points, while
Bennett led the SAE’s with 12.

Jumping to, a small early Jead,
the Pikas held on, keeping only a
few points ahead of the Phi Gam's
until the final whistle gave them
the victory, 47-43. The Pikas lead
2U-17 at the half. Two Pikas; Al
Gaither,’ with 14, and Jim Smith,
with 13, scored between them more
than half of their team’s points. The

gained even more respect for him.
Down in Columbia, 5S. C., last
week, the Wildcat captain had the
hall out of bounds ready to throw
it to his teammates, who had the
Gamecock defense at a disadvan-
tage ‘by virtae of a spill to their
clongated center, Jimmy Slaughter.
Anstead of playing the ball while
Slaughter was down he helped the
tall pivotman to his feet, making
sure he was not injured, While this
act may have cost the Presbyterians
the game, as they lost by one bas-
ket, it proved that there is still a
sense of fair play, among athletes
and especially in the person of the
Davidson guard.

Another example of his excellent
sportsmanship was seen two years
ago against Maryland when an op-
ponent, seeking to prevent a crip
shot, slipped ,to the floor painfully
hurt. The fall left the way open for
an easy lay-up shot, but instead of
shooting, Whit called for time out
and went over and assisted the in-
jured player from the floor.

Such acts are scarce and so are
boys who earn nine varsity letters,
share the state doubles crown in

tennis, run an excellent 220 and
440, hold the school’s highest
honors in sports and leadership,
while suffering from asthma and
weighing a meager 150 pounds. But
then, boys with the drive and ability
of Whit Cobb don’t come along
very often.

VMI No Trouble At
All In Basketball

By BILL FARRIOR

The VMI Cadets were no match
for the superior, Wildcat hoopsters
as they shrank under the terrific
pounding of the Cats. Davidson
shot out into an early lead and
were seldom in danger. The half-
time score of 34-21 .gave an in-
tication of what was to follow.
Brooks and Hengeveld were high
scorers for the Cats with twelve
points apiece, while Nay and Por-
tasik accounted for cleven points
each for the Cadets.
