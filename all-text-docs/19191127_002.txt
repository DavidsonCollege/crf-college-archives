Sophs 36; Juniors 29.

The Sophomores forged into the
lead in the interclass basketball
series by defeating the strong Ju-
nior team by a score of 36 to 29.

The game was played on Tuesday
night, and as was expected. it was
the most hotly contested game yet
played. Neither team had lost a
game and each team was struggling
to keep her record clear. The
Sophs made the’ first basket and
from then on to the end of the first
half neither team led by more than
two baskets.

The Sophomores changed their
lineup between halves and came
back in the last half and played the
Juniors off their feet, obtaining a
safe lead which they held until the
final whistle blew. The game was
hard and fast and was not marred
by rough playing or holding.

and twice on the four-yard line. On
one occasion Furman, with the hall
on the four-yard line, completed a
pass for a touchdown, only to have
it ruled out because the player re-
ceiving the pass stepped with one
foot over the end-zone line beyond
the goal. The Furman team is com-
plete master of the forward pass-
ing game. Spear, speedy halfback,
was as usual the particular star of
the game. Many trick plays were
used successfully.

South Carolina, greatly outweigh-
ed, went down in defeat to the Uni-
versity of Florida by a score of 13
to 0.

Harvard won from Yale in their
annual football classic by a score of
10 to 3. One of the particular fea-
tures of the game was Braden’s
drop-kick of 53 yards for Yale.

The University of North Carolina
is making elaborate preparations
for the Carolina-Virginia Thanks-
giving game. A record-breaking
crowd is expected to attend this
game, the first to be staged on the
University field. From all indica-
tions the two teams are about even-
