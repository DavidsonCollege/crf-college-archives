Faculty Meeting Tuesday
Kills Aggregate Cut Limit

YMCA Blood Drive
Closes Successfully,
310 Pints Donated

With the closing of the Blood-
mobile doors at 5 o’clock this eve-
ning, Davidson gave its answer
to the urgent call for donated
blood. Yesterday and today, from
11 am. to 5 p.m., members of
the student body and townspeople
filed into Johnston Gymnasium to
give blood.

According to the latest figures,
Davidson gave the very creditable
total of 310 pints to this 1953
¥-sponsored campaign.

Throughout the week the need
for blood, expressed in the slogan
“Gamma Globulin for Polio,” has
been echoed and re-echoed many
times—in print, posters, various
town meetings, chapel, and in
door-to-door canvassing. The col-
lege and community were remind-
ed that although the war has
ceased, the number of wounded
veterans requiring transfusions is
still very great. The greatest need
and use for the blood given in this
campaign is in the preparation of
gamma globulin for man’s unend-
ing fight against polio.

The entire drive was carried to
its completion through the serv-
ices of many local groups and vol-
unteers. The Y, through co-chair-
men Corty Cooper and Frank
Mitchener, planned the whole pro-
gram, handled the details, and cor-
related the functions of the other
organizations.

The ROTC department furnished
personnel and equipment as well
as securing helpful publicity. Most
of the individual work was done
by the fraternities, as each fra-
ternity and ‘he Campus Club ap-
pointed its own separate chairman
who determined and fully informed
all potential donors and circulated
the necessary releases. As has
been the custom in the past, any
fraternity who attains 100 per cent
donation from its capable donors
will receive a congratulatory cer-
tificate from the Red Cross.

As this paper went to press,
however, the total figures for the
fraternity certificates had not

Class Cut System

Dean John C. Bailey announced
today that the aggregate cut limit
for sophomores, juniors and
seniors has been abolished by
action of the faculty, effective im-
mediately.

Dean Bailey said that the chief
reason for removing the aggregate
rule was that it entailed more
bookkeeping and other red tape
than its usefulness warranted.

First semester freshmen will
not be affected by the new ruling,
and will continue to be subject to
an eight-cut aggregate.

The statement of the new regu-
lations released from the faculty
through the dean’s office reads as
follows:

“On Tuesday, October 6, 1953, the
Faculty took the following actions
with reference to the absence regu-
lations: .

“1, The aggregate limit on class
absences for sophomores, juniors,
and seniors has been abolished,
effective immediately.. Only the
course limit applies.

“2, There will be no change at
present in the absence regulations
for freshmen and for upperclass-
men who are on first-semester
freshman status because of over-
cutting during the second semester
of the past session.

“3. Beginning in September,
1954, the freshmen will have the
same course limits for absences
from classes during the second
semester as they have under the
present set-up during the first
semester, but the aggregate limit
will be abolished for second-semes-
ter freshmen.

“4. Beginning in September,
1954, upperclassmen who are
placed on first-semester freshman
status for overcutting classes will
be - on first-semester freshman
status with reference to absences
from ‘classes, chapel and vespers.”

According to Deal Bailey, Mrs.
Juanita Morrow is now handling
the absence records in Room 102
between the hours of 2:30 and
4:30 p.m. during the week, and
from 10:15 to 12:00 on Saturday
mornings. He requested that stu-
dents inquire about cuts only dur-
ing those hours.

ARTIST SERIES BRINGS
RAINS ON WEDNESDAY

Claude Rains, internationally
known for his many fine stage,

screen, and television characteriza-|_

tions, embarks upon a new phase
of his already famous theatrical
career when he presents his new
one-man show at Davidson College
next Wednesday evening, October
14, at 8:15 p.m.

Speaking “great words to great
music” Mr. Rains will be accom-
panied by pianist Jack Maxin in
a varied program of classical fa-
-yorites from Chaucer to T. S. Eliot.

One of the highlights of the pro-
gram is the reciting of Tennyson's
“Enoch Arden” to music especial-
ly written by Richard Strauss for
dramatic presentation. Strauss
wrote this music for “Enoch
Arden” thirty years ago for the
great German actor, Max Heinrich,

who performed it with great suc-
cess all over Europe.
Following Rains on the Davidson
Series will be such distinguished
performers as Charles Laughton on
December 1, Metropolitan Opera
tenor Jan Peerce on December 16,
violinist Isaac Stern on February
13, and poet Carl Sandburg on
March 31. The Series is open to
the public on both season and in-
dividual performance basis.
Among the other numbers to
be presented by Rains in his new
dramatic venture are a modern
edited version of Chaucer's “Pro-
logue to the Wife of Bath,” scenes
from Shakespeare's “Richard II”
and “Julius Caesar,” and “Builders
of America” with words by Edward
Shenton and music by Harl Mc-
Donald. _,

very definite and important part
in life at Davidson.

In its session last Monday the

Honor Is Stressed
By Student Council

“Personal Honor and Student
Representation” is the motto of
this year’s Student Council.

One of the strikingly distinctive
elements of Davidson College is
the honor system found here. This
year, the Student Council is en-
deavoring to develop a deeper
sense of honor in the life of each
student. Plans are being made for
guest spenkers from other col-
leges ane universities to visit Da-
vidson and talk with the student
body in regard to the various sys-
téms of honor found elsewhere.

Plans are also being made for
a bronze plaque which will serve
to remind the student of the per-
sonal honor, to self, family, and
God, which traditionally prevails
here.

The other capacity of the Stu-
dent Council is that of mediator
between faculty and student. Prob-
lems are voiced, discussed, and
judged in the presence of our stu-
dent representatives. The council
therefore welcomes any protests or
suggestions that the student body
may have.

Vespers & Chapel

Sunday, October 11th, Vespers will
be conducted by the Reverend
James T. Cleland, D.D., of the
Duke Divinity School.

Monday, October 12th, Dr. J. C.

ceglia, who is the director of
Presbyterian-Italian Missions in
Kansas City, Missouri.

Friday, October 16, will be student
day as usual with Professor

DR. SAMUEL SPENCER

Dr. Spencer
Publishes
New History

Dr. Samuel R. Spencer, Jr., as-
sistant to the president of David-
son College, is the .author of a
new book, “Decision for War,
1917,” which will be released this
week.

Dr. Spencer, who also serves on.
the Davidson faculty as a member
of the history department, deals
with American public opinion be-
fore World War I and the key
factors which influenced opinion
against Geimany. .

He cites the sinking of the
Cunard liner, Laconia, and the
famous Zimmerman Telegram as
the two major events which led
to unfavorable public reaction to-
ward the Central Powers.

Written for the layman as well
as the professional historian, the
book is based on extensive research
of newspapers and magazines of
the time, and the papers of Wood.
row Wilson and other public
figures.

The noted Yale historian Dr.
Charles Seymour, wrote the fore-
word for “Decision for War, 1917.”

Dr. Seymour was very compli-
mentary of the new book and
wrote in his foreword: “This is an
important book, essential to a
clear understanding of the factors
which brought the United States
into the first World War. With ad-
mirable objectivity and sense of
balance it indicates the various
factors which were brought into
combination and compelled Ameri-
can intervention.

“The two striking events upon
which this book is concentrated
... Clearly tilted the scales of that
opinion heavily. It is historically
important, therefore, that they
should be examined in the circum.
stances that surrounded them with
the careful. scrutiny which the
author has devoted to their
study.”

The book is being published by
Richard R. Smith Publisher, Inc.,
of West Rindge, N.H.

A native of Rock Hill, S. ¢., Dr.
Spencer is a graduate of David-
son and received both the M.A.
and Ph. D. degrees from Harvard
University. He served”for more
than five years with the Army
during World War Il and was dis:
charged in 1946 with the rank of
major.

Formerly with the Vick Chemi-
cal Company and Davidson’s de-
partment of public relations, he
was appointed assistant to Presi-
dent John R. Cunningham in 1951.

‘STUD’ ALTERS HOURS,
ORDERS CLASS RINGS

According to Jim Faires, man-
ager of the Student Store, the
“Stud” will be open every day of
the week, with the exception of
Sunday, from 8:00 a.m. until 11:30
p.m. The only time that the store
will be closed is during chapel.

In addition to all sorts of school
supplies and the usual array of
Davidson tee-shirts and jackets;
golf and tennis equipment, sports
shoes, and sport shirts will be
sold this year at the store.

As in previous years, all orders
for class rings must go through
the Student Store. This year both
Herf-Jones Co. and J. Jenkins’
Sons rings will be offered.

Anyone wishing to purchase a
ring may contact the manager at
the store immediately after chapel
and also from 7:00 until 11:30 p.m.
A $10.00 deposit must be made
upon ordering a ring, and six to
eight weeks allowed for shipment.

DUKE, EAST DORMS | Unusual Decorations,
OPEN FOR DANCES (Spivak, And Singer

As has been customary in the
past, several dormitories will be
cleared for Homecoming to house
the influx of females. This year
both Duke and East will be used,
with a capacity of about 100 and
180 respectively.

Men in these dorms will, of
course, have first chance at the
rooms, as they will be put to the
inconvenience of moving out.

For those who are moved out
of Duke and East, beds and furni-
ture will be set up in the old din-
ing room of Chambers and in
Johnston Gymnasium. Lists will be
posted by Mrs. Little in Duke and
East, and will remain there prob-
ably next Monday and Tuesday;
those wanting to may sign then.

Mrs. Little has also suggested
that any one who is not planning
to attend the dances should sign
up for a bed in one of the other
dormitories to escape the noise
and confusion. First consideration
will be given to these few, but
men with or without dates, can
get accommodations of this type
if there is enough room.

There are two reasons for sign-
ing: to see how many beds will
be needed and in case of emer-
gency to get some idea of the
whereabouts of everyone. There
will probably be a meeting after
chapel Friday in order to clear up
several matters with inhabitants
of Duke and East. Anyone else who
has a question can see Mrs. Little
in her office on the first floor of
Watts.

MONTH REMAINING
TO GET FULBRIGHT
APPLICATIONS IN

Oetober 31, 1953, is the closing
date of the competition for United
States Government educational ex-
change grants for graduate study
abroad, it was announced today by
Kenneth Holiand, president of the
Institute of International Educa-
tion, 1 East 67th Street, New York
City.

One month remains in which to
apply for awards under the Ful-
bright and Buenos Aires Conven-
tion programs for the 1954-55
academic year. An exception is the
program for Australia and New
Zealand, for which October 15 is
the closing date.

Scholarship application blanks
are available at the Institute or
in the offices of Fulbright advisers
on college and university cam-
puses, A brochure describing the
overseas study awards may be ob-
tained from the Institute.

The programs under the Ful-
bright Act and the Buenos Aires
Convention (for the Promotion of
Inter-American Cultural Relations)
are part of the international edu-
cational exchange activities of the
Department of States. They will
give almost 1000 American citizens
the chance to study abroad during
the 1954-55 academic year. Since
the establishment of the Fulbright
Program in 1947, over 2700 Ameri-
can students have gone abroad
under its auspices, and 974 have
accepted grants for the current
academic year.

Under the older Buenos Aires
Convention Program sixteen Latin
American countries have offered
awards to one or two Americans
a year since the program's incep-
tion in 1937.

Countries where U. S. graduate
students may study under the
Fulbright Program are Australia,
Austria, Belgium, and Luxemburg,
Burma, Denmark, Egypt, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, India,
Iraq, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan,
the Philippines, Thailand, the
Union of South Africa, and the
United Kingdom.
~ Special provision is made in the
program for Germany for twenty-
five grants to American graduate
students who will serve as English

Mark Homecoming

Something new and different in
decorations is in store for those
planning to attend the Homecom-
ing dances. next weekend, IFC
president Charlie Hassell said to-
day.

The IFC has spent a great deal
of time on getting some originality
into the decorations os a further
attraction for Charlie Spivak’s
two-night stand here Friday and
Saturday and hopes for a large
attendance from the student body.

Spivak, featuring Eileen Rodgers
and Joe Tucker as vocalists, will
put in a total of ten hours enter-
tainment next weekend. The
genial bandleader wil) get the
formal dance Friday night under
way at nine and sign off at one.
After a two-hour concert following
the football game. with Presby-
terian Saturday afternoon, Spivak
will play from eight to twelve for
the informal dance.

Independents who wish to pur-
chase tickets to the Homecoming
dances should get them from
Clark Reed, Campus Club and In-
dependent ticket representative.
Since the recent adoption by the
IFC of a rule disallowing the re-
sale of fraternity tickets to non-
fraternity men, Independents will
not be admitted to the dances on
any other than the special inde-
pendent ticket.

Spivak, who played last year for
the IFC -Midwinters dances, was
rated as the most sought after
free lance trumpeter in the coun-
try for many years before he
formed his own dance band. He
played with radio’s leading con-
ductors on the most important
programs. Before that time, Charlie
was featured with such great
bands as those conducted by
the Dorsey Brothers, Ray Noble
and Ben Pollack.

During his free-lance days, he
earned more each week than many
top-notch bandleaders, but decided
to toss his security aside to form
his own unit. Bear in mind the
fact that though he was well estab-
lished as America’s finest trumpet
player, he had little reputation
with the cash customers. To them,
fronting his own band, he was a
virtual newcomer.

But Charlie went and did it, as
the saying goes, in spite of all
the difficulties and today, his is
rated as one of America’s top
bands—on records, in the movies,
at theaters and hotels.

Wildcats Are Underdogs
For Annual Arch Rivalry

By ANDY TURNER.

The Davidson Wildcats will be out for their first win of
the season when they tangle with the favored Wolfpack of
North Carolina State tomorrow night at Raleigh. Game time

CRUTCHFIELD HEADS
SERIES COMMITTEE

Robert S. Crutchfield of Orange-
burg, South Carolina, a member
of the senior class, will head the
college student Artist Series com-
mittee, Donald B. Plott, chairman
of the faculty committee an-
nounced today.

T. Alden Williams of Montreat,
Malcolm Williamson, Jr., of
Waynesville, Vereen Bell; Jr., of
Quitman, Georgia, and John T.
Harmon of Laurens, South Caro-
lina, will assist Crutchfield in pro-
moting the 1953-54 series, which
begins Wednesday, October 14,
when stage, screen, and television
star Claude Rains presents his new
show, “Great Words With Great
Music,” in Chambers Auditorium at
8:15.

The series for this year, an-
nouncement of which has already
created a demand for tickets over
a wide area, will feature “in per-
son” performances by Rains and

(Continued On Page Four)

In the long history of the rivalry
between Davidson's Wildcats and
the Wolfpack of North Carolina
State, Davidson has won only 11
times while dropping 26 and tie-
ing 6. The Cats will be out for
win number 12 in the series and
for revenge for the drubbings they
have received at the hands of the
Wolfpack for the last three years.

State also will be seeing their
first win of the season, having
dropped two previous games to
Carolina (6-29), and to George
Washington (7-20).

Dole Optimistic

Coach Dole describes State as
strong, big and tough, but he says
that the team is capable of up-
setting State and will be out there
trying every minute of the game.
“We'll be outmanned, but we're
going to Raleigh to win,” were the
fighting words of Dole.

The Cats, after a weeks rest,
are expected to be at top strength
with the exception of tackle Ben
Craig who will miss the game due
to a knee injury received in the
Richmond game. It is feared that
the big captain of the Wildcats
will be out on that injury for the
remainder of the season. Craig's
loss will be a big blow to the Cat
forward wall and he will be sorely
missed. .

spected jurist, a candidate for gov-
ernor.

Both films will begin at 8:15
p.m. each night. The regular ad.
mission price of 25 cents will be

Wilson Has Wealth Of English
To Give Aspiring Davidsonians

Dr. James Southall Wilson, visit-
ing professor of English at David-
son for the current year, brings
to the campus a wealth of back-
ground in English literature which
many of the students are already
enjoying.

And thus Davidson College is
added to Dr. Wilson's list of insti-
tutions of. higher learning with
which he has been associated. He
completed his undergraduate work
at William and Mary, obtained his
M. A. degree from the University
of Virginia, and received his Ph.D.
at Princeton University.

Later he was awarded an LL.D.
from William and Mary. While an
undergraduate at William and
Mary Dr. Wilson became a member
of Phi Beta Kappa, the well-known
scholastic fraternity. His studies
throughout graduate schools were
directed toward Edgar A. Poe and
Shakespeare.

After teaching for thirteen years
at William and Mary, his alma
mater, Dr. Wilson became the Dean
of graduate school and occupied
the position as the Edgar Allan

By SWAIN LOY

Poe professor at the University of
Virginia. During the summers from
1928 to 1945 he taught at the
Breadloaf (Vermont) School of
English.

Following his retirement from
the University of Virginia, Dr. Wil-
son was selected by the John Hay
Whitney Foundation to become a
visiting professor in English for
some of the schools throughout
the country that the foundation
had opproved.

Under this program—tirst called
the “Great Teachers Fellowship
Program’’—a professor of one of
the humanities was selected by
the foundation and also a number
of colleges and universities were
chosen for the program.

By mutual agreement between
professor and the school, the pair-
ings were completed. During the
first year of the program. Dr.
Wilson was a visiting professor at
Louisiana State University, from
which he comes to us for his
second year in the program.

Dr. Wilson has been the author
of several volumes on Poe and was

co-editor of The Enchanted Years.
He was the founding editor of the
Virginia Quarterly Review, a mem-
ber of the Modern Language As-
sociation, and a recognized scholar
in his field.

The large turnout for his Shake-
spearean course here at Davidson
is not an unusual thing for his
classes. It does indicate, however,
the anticipation of the student
body for the opportunity to study
under such a great teacher as he
is. Dr. Wilson says that his inten-
tions for his Shakespearean course
are to develop a real and keen
interest in the students for the
great literature which Shakespeare
gave the world.

His emphasis is on the enjoy-
ment of the literature itself, with
whatever necessary information
for a greater appreciation of lit-
erature secondary and supplemen-

Davidson College is indeed for-
tunate to have this addition to the
faculty. Dr. Wilson is both a
scholar and a gentleman of the
highest caliber.
