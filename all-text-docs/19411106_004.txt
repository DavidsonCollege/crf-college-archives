ed. It may be Gene Sutton, or Dr. Frontis Johnston; they’re
the most likely contenders. At®ahy rate, we can hope that the

exhibition was a success, because its a privilege that should not
be disregarded.

DAVIDSON VS. DUKE

To say that the Cats will have their hands full come Sat-
urday would be putting things rather mildly. Wallace Wade
is bringing one of the powerhouses of the national football
scene to Richardson field to meet the Cats and to report
a Duke-written- newspaper account, they-aren’t_ taking
the game too seriously. However, without going too far
beyond the realm of probability it’s not hard to see a rather
close ball game; maybe not close in the final outcome, but
close in the score which the Devils can run up against us.

Against Georgia Tech last uweek,-lPom Davis and his mates
were forced to gg ints the ¢ when thes needed the points,
and everybody k now that The Engineers don’t have any world
beater. On the gro ind they held ‘the Devils rather effectively,

as have all the other teams which the Dukes have encountered,

and maybebavidson can do it tuo,

The injury list which once claimed:so many and so vital
a section of the Cat’s first stringers, has in a sense felt the
telling effects of time, and is gradually shrinking. Every
week there’s an old face back into the lineup, and every old
face makes the situation just a little better. Herb Rainey
may be the face which reappears this week, and no other
could be more welcome. He would help tremendously in
the Davidson center.

HACKNEY VS. DUKE

Another interesting featute of the game to the Davidgon

student body will be Claud& Hackney’s fight. against fate, or
what-have-you. Hackney’s got a record for scoring against
the Devils which no other footballer in the country can touch.

He’s tallied three touchdowns in two years of play, and if the
Cat offensive goes according he may be adding at
least one more to his total. Last year it was by a spectacular
route that he got his 12 points. After grabbing a pass in the
Duke secondary Hackney outsprinted Duke’s famed speedster
Bill Wartman to the goal line. The second one came ona 95
yard kickoff return straight up the center of the field, and it
tied the count on the mighty Devils.

to schedule

Come what may, Davidson supporters will have a chance
to see a big time football team, whether or not it’ll be a big-
time football team beaten remains to be seen.
