The service at the Convict Camp is. usually
conducted as a devotional service rather than
a Sunday School. There usually are about
50 men there, 15 of whom are whites. It
has been the custom for some member of the
faculty or student body to go there on Sun-
day afternoons and talk to them. Last Sun-

day Mr. Jackson talked to them on The
Fundamentals of Salvation,
At Cornelius a new class of girls was

organized, with W. HH.) Allison as teacher.

At Hobson Chapel the attendance fell
down to 50, which is 15 less than the average.
This Sunday School is under the control of
the First Presbyterian Church, Moores-
ville. During the summer Dwight Chalmers,
who had charge of it, did much to build it
up.

“T did not

Roentgen covered the tube with black
paper. Still the cardboard glowed. He took
photographs through:a pine door and dis-
covered on them a white band correspond-

investigation led to the discovery of X-rays.

_ Roentgen’s rays have proved an inestim-

able boon to humanity.

In the hands of

doctor and surgeon they are saving life

and reducing suffering.

In the hands of

the scientist they are yielding new knowl-
edge—even of the arrangement and
structure of atoms. The Research Labora-
tories of the General Electric Company
have contributed greatly to these ends by
developing more powerful and efficacious

X-ray tubes.
