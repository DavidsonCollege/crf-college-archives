Jones Publishes Result
Of Experimental Work

‘Dr. Robert G. Jones, Assist-
ant Dean. of Students, has gain-
.ed recognition for his experi-
mental work in psychology
through the recent publication
of his research article. ‘‘Optim-
um Conformity as an Ingratia-
tion Tactic.”

The study, co-authored by
Dr. Edward E. Jones, professor
of psychology at Duke Univer-
sity, was published in the Sep-
tember issue of Journal of Per-
sonality. Edward Jones is also
the winner of the Appleton Cen-
tury Cross Award for 1964 in
the field of behavioral science.

The experiment described in
the article lasted almost a year
and included 60 Duke male un-
dergraduate students. After di-
viding them into groups of fives.
the two psychologists set up sit-
uations in which the. students
tried to resolve a particular dil-
emma by making themselves
attractive to an examiner. The
main hypothesis stated that in
order to win the approval of an-
other, one must “avoid over-
.conformity as well as errant
disagreement.”

According to Robert Jones.

Nelson And Neal
To Appear Tonight

Harry Lee Neal and his wife,
Allison Nelson, duo - pianists,
will be featured in the Artist
Series concert tonight at 8:15
p.m. in Hodson Hall. The pro-
gram will feature a wide selec-
tion of numbers ranging in var-
jiety {rom Mendelssohn to
Brahms.

The couple is probably as well
known for their unusual means
of travel as they are for their
musical ability. They are to ar-
rive at Davidson early Friday
afternoon in a bus custom de-
signed by Neal. The engine was
shifted to the front to make
room for two grand pianos in
back. Between the engine and
the pianos are a living room,
kitchen. dinette. bathroom, and
sleeping quarters for the couple
and their three children.

After their arrival the Neals
will spend several hours un-
loading the pianos, arranging
them, adjusting the lights, and
tuning the pianos. Then they
will settle down for a home
cooked dinner. At 8:15 p.m. they
will appear in formal! attire for
a two-hour presentation of their
four-hand art.

Their program will begin with
Mendelssohn's OVERTURE to
A Midsummer Night’s Dream.
This selection illustrates the
main features of Shakespeare’s
play. The remainder of the pro-
gram will consist of selections
from Brahms.

“Response to our research ar-
ticle has been very good. We’ve
had numerous written requests

for additional copies." Having
now authored three published
articles, Jones is currently or-
ganizing a dissertation called

“A Search for a Systematic Er-

ror in Interpersonal Percep.
tion.”

Jones, a 1938 graduate of Dav-
idson, earned a BD from. Yale
Divinity School in 1961 and a
PhD from Duke University. in
1964. In addition to serving as
the liaison between the admin-
istration and the fraternities,
Jones is teaching a Psychology
21 class.

tour, however, other plans are
being made to finance the up-
coming tour for the summer of
1965.

With the cooperation of Char- ;

les (Lefty) Driesell, basketball
coach, and Bill Bondurant,
alumni director, plans had
previously been made to hold
a Varsity-Freshman basketball
scrimmage in the Charlotte
Coliseum on Nov. 20 to finance
the, more than $10,000 needed
for the trip. However. due to a
rule of the Southern Conference.
this will not be possible.

The Conference rule states
that a school may not hold an
off-campus intramural scrim.
mage at which admission is
charged. The NCAA has no
such rule, and it is peculiar to
the Southern Conference.

Southern Conference Com-
missioner Lloyd Jordan ruled
that the Coliseum could not be
considered on-campus, despite
the fact that it serves as home
court. for several Davidson bas-
ketball games and that John-
ston Gymnasium is undergoing
construction and will be un-
available for games before Dec.
1, Jordan also refused to poll
other Southern Conference
member schools to obtain their
interpretation of the rule.

Cost of the trip would be over
$20,000, of which more than
$10,000 has already been raised
by the members of the Chorus
themselves through work last

summer, Bondurant said. The
trip will be made possible
through special arrangement
with the Davidson College
Alumni, European Tour. The
Chorus would accompany the

‘Alumni Tour aboard a. charter-

ed jet leaving Charlotte on June
14, stopping at London and
Paris, and returning on July
14. Such arrangements. would
make round-trip fares for the
Chorus approximately half what
it would be for individual Ppas-

THE DAVIDSONIAN

There is a staggering amount
of material sent out through
this department; the. alumni
cards alone number 13,000. Rog-
er Greene, who is in charge of
the computer, explained that
whenever mailing lists were
needed, he could take the
punch-cards from the file, run
them through the IBM sorting
machine, which would arrange
them according to zip code
numbers, classes, or virtually
any category that was required.

Then these sorted cards
would be run through the IBM
403, which address the envel-
opes for mailing immediately. If
this doesn’t sound fast or neat
enough, he added that the 403
was soon to be replaced by the
IBM 831, an addressing machine
which can put out 8000 envel-
opes per minute.

“But”, said Greene, “If a card
is accidently dropped out of
order, there is a contfaption
that will place. it back into the
right place in a matter o’ min-
utes. Think of the time that
would save instead of going
through the whole 13,000
cards.”

Other machines that Greene
uses are the IBM 26 Key punch,
Reproducing punch,
IBM 548 Intercepter, and 1BM
Collater. With such an array of

Beside Greene's and Mrs.
Thompson's areas, there is the
Data-processing Department, run
by Dr. Locke White. Here is
housed the IBM 1260 or “elec.
tronic brain.” This piece of
equipment can perform almost
any task which it is asked to
do—within reason, of course.
It is this machine which aver-
ages grades (could be of in.

jected averages, and does seve-
ral other valuable tasks

MIMEOGRAPHING SERVICE

But this is not all there is in
the basement of Chambers. Herc
the faculty can have their writs
reviews and exams typed ane
mimeographed. There is a seps
rate duplicating machine fo
faculty use, as well as the mim
eograph room, run by Johr
Brice and Lewis Connor. In ad
dition, the faculty: has az225
to two “cubby holes” whic’
they can use to prepare theii
little gems or to have pr.vate
dictation.

Since most of the publicity,
comes threugh the basement.
it is only fitting that the dark
room of the three College
photographers should be there.
Charlie Raynal, Erskine Sproul,
and A. Kennedy keep their
equipment in the photography
room as well as the pictures
for College propaganda.

Because this department of
the Administration is somewhat
out of the way, « large number
of the students do‘not know
where it is, much less what its
function is. This ts a shame, for
it is a vital part in the College;
it handles a vast amount of
work, and, as if it did not have
enough to do now, “we’re” said
Roger Green, “going to be ex
panding soon.”

IFC Discusses Past

And Reveals Plans

Rick von Unwerth. IFC. presi-
dent, has announced several
important additions to and ob-
servations on the IFC program.

In the planning stages for
next semester is an inter-fra-
ternity leadership retreat where
fraternity office holders will dis-
cuss their’ mutual problems and
programs for the coming year.
Von Unwerth pointed out that

‘the drama festival to be spon-

sored by the IFC was less than
three months away, so work on

‘the individual productions should

begin soon. Rupert T. Barber,
professor of drama and speech,
has alist of one-act plays avail-
abie for use in the festival.

On Dec. 3-6 Fred Sackett and
Rocky Walker will attend a Na-
ional Interfraternity Conference
in Cincinnatl.

In commenting on the Herbie
Mann Sextet Concert Nov. 14,
Von Unwetth said. ‘“‘The large
crowd that did attend certainly
indicated by their enthusiasm
that the somewhat different
sound of. Herbie Mann's jazz
was a very successful change
of pace.” Von Unwerth also not-
ed that everyone he had talked
to who attended the Friday night
dance with the Catalinas had
enjoyed the music and the
dance.

tee is meeting Monday. Nov. 23,

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1964
IN JOHNSTON GYM

TV Cables Installed
For Sports Coverage

A television cable to facili-
tate the telecasting of the David-
son-VMI basketball game, Dec.
15, is being laid between Cham-
‘bers Building and Johnston
Gymnasium by the Southern
Bell Telephone Company.

Sponsored almost entirely by
the Bell Telephone Company,
the project is being completed
with little expense to Davidson
College. In fact, the only cost
defrayed by the college involv-
ves the purchasing of metal
conduits to incase the cable.

According to Dr. Tom Scott,
director of athletics, the tele-
vision setup will be used to tele-
vise various basketball, foot-
ball, and track events. The main
line of the cable will be attached
to a new press box which will
be suspended from the ceiling
along the east wall of the gym.
An extension will also be run
to the press box in Richardson
Field.

Grover C. Mectze, Jr., direc-
tor of the physical plant, explain:
ed that any future transmis
‘gion sent From the microwave
transmitter atop Chambers
Building would go first to the
Bell Telephone Company re-
ceivers and then be relayed to
some television station in Char-
lotte.

Meetze added that the pre-
sent work is part of a long-
range plan to encourage broad-
casting from Davidson. Al-
though the new cable is mainly
for athletic events, provisions
are being made to allow the
addition of a later cable to the
Cunningham Fine Arts Build-
ing. The building already’ has
professional broadcasting equ-
ipment, and with the laying of
another cable. it would be pos-
sible to televise many concerts
or dramatic performances. How-
ever, at present there are no
definite plans for such a cable.

The chief problem of con-
struction in Chambers Building
is the excessive amount of.
noise caused by drilling through
the concrete, especially around
the Dome Room. Although Meet-
ze could set no deadline for the
project's conipletion, he hopes
it will be finished as soon as
possible.

At the other end of the cable
there is more _ construction
work. Besides the press box.
plans include the building of
300 additional seats. Scott wry-
ly commented, ‘‘We have to
have these seats completed by
Dec. 8 because we've already
sold the tickets for that night.”

The current contract for
broadcasting Davidson basket-
ball involves WBT radio and
WSOC television. With the new
facilities. television coverage
promises to be better than last.

ed that a television station in

Wednesday about wanting .o

As whether or not any events
other than basketball will be
televised in  .the foreseeable
future, Scott said that it would
be up to the interest of the
