Farewell... .

In just a few more days Davidson
College will celebrate her third commen-
cement excerise during 1945. At that time
ten of our seniors will receive their a-
wards, and will then turn to face the grim
realities of this war-torn world. Their
presence amidst the activities of the col-
lege campus will be greatly missed, ‘for
they leave behind them unoccupied of-

fices to be filled by inexperienced sopho-

mores and juniors.

Some few, perhaps, are leaving the
college never to return again, although
we may rest assured that they will al-
ways hold a warm spot in their hearts
for their dear alma mater. Others will
return to resume acquaintances with the
administration and townspeople. - But
wherever you may be at any time David-
son will always remember you.

Whatever task you now. undertake
we feel sure of fame and success for you.
Take whatever you have learned to heart
for us to the best of your ability. And so,
dear seniors, we bid thee a fond farewell.

Thirty ....

We have now come to the last issue
of the Davidsonian for this summer, and
although we realize that there have been
instances in which the paper could have
served the students more capably, it has
been a good edition for everyone on the
whole, and we look forward to bigger and
better issues in the fall.

Let us_reverse_our thoughts a few
moments and recall a few of the things
that have made this summer a success
for the students. ..). Things-began to
happen for the freshmen with the ap-
pointment of the court of control for the
summer. Under the capable leadership of
Judge Lazenby, who. served as head’ of
the court for the first term, the court
progressed very successfully. Many an
upper-classman was heard remarking of

& resents
C features

the effectiveness of the court over pre-
vious wat-time courts. And so we take
our hat off to.D. H. for his excellent
work. .. . The informal dance first term
proved a very successful added attraction
to the. campus activities. Also the picnic
before the dance played its part in com-
pleting a_ well-rounded. evening. Thanks
to the ‘“Y” cabinet and to Ed Golden, in
particular, for their efforts in making the
dance a success. .. . O.D.K., under the
leadership of Buddy Wells, has been very
active all summer. Again we take this
opportunity to extend our congratulations
to the five students who were tapped by
the honorary leadership fraternity this
summer. ... In the field of sports inter-
mural softball has been enjoyed by all.
First term saw the Independents sweep
the series with no losses. Thus far the
race this second term has been close and
exciting. . . Our congratulations to the
student council and the ‘“Y” cabinet in
making the informal dance second term a
success... . Hats off to Rod MacDonald
for his faithful work as Judge of the
court this term. . . . Incidently, what’s
happened to Gay lately? ,. . Early morn-
ing devotions Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday success. . . . Late sessions in the
stud and at Shelton’s. . . . co-eds.
swims at Harris Lake. . . . Hot weather.

Yes, the summer has passed quickly
— too quickly for some, and it has been
a lot of fun for everyone.

Now Yt is time for us to turn our
thoughts to the opening of school in the
fall. Approximately three hundred stu-
dents will enter Davidson this fall, and to
them we extend, our best wishes. There
will be many new faces around the cam-
pus; some of us will not be back. New
officers will be elected in the student,

body, and to them we-offer hearty con-

gratulations, ensured.that they will do
a good job in carrying on where their pre-
decessors left off.

To our graduates we bid farewell,
and look to them for leadership as alumni.
They are now entering upon the grim
realities of the world, and to each and
every one we wish the best of luck life
has to offer.

The Editor wishes to take this oppor-
tunity to thank the entire staff for their
cooperation in putting out the paper this
summer, for the fun we’ve had, and for
the excellent work whigh they have done.
Bruce and Harry have labored with us
until the wee small ones—neither will
return next year, and we thank them for
their tireless efforts.

The business staff also deserves much
credit for its excellent work in getting ads
and circulating the paper. Thanks Bob
and Margie.

We extend best wishes to the new
staff, whoever they may be, and we look
for a bigger and better Davidsonian to
help build a bigger and better Davidson.

And so with thoughts of the past in
our mind and hopes for the future in our
hearts, we sign our last “thirty”. _

YOURS
9
voy”
By Buddy Wells
As we begin the last column of
“Yours From The “Y” we would
like to say a word of thanks to
everyone who has had a part in
making the work of the “Y” help-

ful on the campus this summer.

The Cabinet is proud and happy
to welcome its newest member, Joe
Stukes. He is head of the Depart-
ment of Boy’s Work. Joe is a good
man for any post, and no exception
here. I know too that no one of us
has forgotten what a certain fel-
low had to say about “Casey At
The Bat.” Speaking of | Chapel
Talks, don’t forget what Jim Robin-
son told us about a month ago about
the Ten Commandments, our break-
ing of them and our pardon. That is
an important thought, the most im-
portant. Our last student Chapel
Service will be led by Bruce Fisher,
our “Y” President. We look for-
ward to listening with pleasure and
profit.

You would be pleased to see the
fine spirit of the Cabinet in its
meetings. It might be a good idea
to invite some’ members of the
student body in some time to see the
varied work of the “Y” and to see
how sincerely the Cabinet works to
do the work with which it is en-
trusted. The spirit of the Cabinet
has grown all summer along with
the Spiritual Atmosphere. Of course
that is almost a truism, because
whereever there is spiritual power
there is plenty of spirit and drive.
Back the Cabinet in the things it
tries to do, and most of all with
your prayers. The Cabinet is back-
ing you with its prayers. Some of
the students asked the “Y” Cabinet
to start a worship service for those
who would like to attend. You heard
the announcement about the service
that has been begun, but maybe
you haven't been to one yet. The
success of meetings such as these
does not lie in the number that
attends, but in the spiritual blessing
that those who do attend receive.
It is encouraging to see how many
have responded and are in the stu-
dent room every Monday, Wednes-
day, and Friday at 7:45 a. m. Coine
and see. We are glad to see that
there are those who are willing and
desirous to pray and worship. That
is as it should be at a Christian
college like Davidson, and at any
other like Christian college.

One of the neglected functions’ of
the “Y’s” work for years has been
in the private devotions of the stu-
dents, This summer the Spiritual
Life Dept. is trying to remedy that.
That personal devoton booklet that
you received is to help you to live
closer to God, if you will use it.
Read that last statement again, it
is important. The attendance at
Hall Prayer Meetings is still above
the mark set early in the summer.
The last one should be the best. The
last Hymn Sing of the summer's
planned for August 19 at the “Y”.
One proof. that they have been en-
joyed so far is that on Sunday nights
when no “sing” has been announted
students have been seen at the “Y”
You
might be interested in the fact that
one of the things that the “Y” is
doing this summer in the Depart-
ment of Community Work is the
supplying of the colored Methodist
Church with new Methodist
Hymnals.

This is all from the “Y” this sum-

mer, We close by wishing “God- .

speed to those who will not return.
You will be missed. To you who
will return. “So long” until Sept. 11.

“FIFTH”
COLUMN
HINTS

‘As this is the last issue of the
Davidsonian for this summer, this
will be the last chance for you
people to read this column, so you

had better take advantage of your
opportunities while you may.

With the opening of the second
term of summer school, ‘our campus
has been enchanced by the presence
of several new co-eds, which. we
dont mind at all. But as_ usual,
they bring problems to the male
members of our student body. Take
the case of Warren Higgin Botham
and Jimmy Nisbet who both seem
to be veying for the hand of Gene-
vive Parks. We hope that no com-
plications set in. Of course, we still
have a couple of old faithfuls who
have stuck it out since last Septem-
ber, such as Blain and Youngblood,
Skeebo and Margaret Fisher. By
the way, we understand that Marga-
ret is wearing something that
strongly resembles a Beta pin. Con-
gratulations to you both. Skeebo
sure did pick a nice private placé in
which to give Margaret his pin. But
then, Maybe there is something ro-
mantic about the halls of Chambers.

It seems to us that Rod McDonald
must be trying to learn how to be
a Mayor or something. He certainly,
does spend enough time with the
Mayor’s daughter, anyway. But
after seeing the Mayor's daughter,
we don’t blame him.

It would be a safe bet to say that

- the horses in Sheltén’s pasture are

the best fed animals in the world.
Every night, at least one couple
can be seen walking toward the
pasture, and.if you ask them where
they are going, they say that they
are going to feed the horses, they
certainly must feed them a lot too,
because sometimes, they don’t come
back for hours.

Probably the greatest diversion
Which the summer school student
body expétiences are the nightly
softball games down in the stad-
ium. From these games have evol-
ed several stars of the game. Some:
of them are as follows: Gold Star
Johnson, who talks one of the best
games we have seen; Stukes, the
wonder boy; Meelar the star; and
perfect peg Harris. We understand
that the Gentiles finally got Harris
at football practice the other day.
Better watch those Gentiles, Harris.
If you have’ real good eyes, you
may catch a glimps of Lightening
Yongue whizzing around the dia-
mond one of these nights. Of course,
if you haven’t got good eyes, it is
always possible to see Royster play-
ing his consistently Sterling game.

We are glad to see that our tavo
‘returned servicemen, Bill Rogers
and Bill McLean are beginning to
get back in the swing of things. We
understand that they have been
entertaining a couple of Queens
cuties this summer. Keep up the
good work men.

The Court of Control has really
got a good idea for advertising
the coming student council dance.
You freshmen look mighty sharp
with those signs cunningly hinged
to your shoulder blades. You really
dhouldn’t complain about having
to wear them. Just think! If you
run out of shirts, (which is not hard
to do with the laundry service these
days) you don’t have to worry. .

It certainly is nice to see that
@hey are tearing down the old |
gymn. Maybe they will unearth the
bodies of the freshmen who were
trampled to death on “Cigarette
Days” at the stud. But the Project
has its disadvantages also. As one
