Cats earn revenge with double overtime win over Morehead St.

Matt GARFIELD
News Editor

Ryan Crawford is growing accustomed to
winning games for Davidson.

The senior All-America cornerback’s
weekly late-game heroics this time helped
the Wildcats top Morehead State 38-31 in a

. double-overtime thriller on Oct. 7, and avenge

last year’s ugly season-opening 40-0 loss to
the Eagles.

For the

straight
week,
Crawford
blocked a
field-goal at-
tempt and broke up the game’s final pass play
to secure a Davidson victory.

With the score tied at 24 late in the fourth
quarter and the Eagles lined up for a potential
game-winning field goal, Crawford streaked
in from the left side of the defensive line and
blocked the kick, sending the game into over-
time.

Later Crawford batted down Eagles’ quar-
terback David Dinkins’ fourth-down attempt
in double-overtime to secure the Wildcats’
fourth victory of the season.

“We knew we had a different team this
year,” said Crawford. “We really came in
with a different attitude.”

With the victory, Joe Susan became the
first head coach in Davidson football history
to start with a 4-0 mark. This is also the first
time Davidson has started a season 4-0 since

reaching the Tangerine Bowl in 1969.

Crawford’s supporting cast featured usual
suspects like junior tailback Bryan Fish, who

Davidson won the first coin toss and elected
to go on defense. But it took Morehead St.
only three plays to score a touchdown, thus
forcing the Wildcats’ offense into a score-or-
lose situation.

to even the score and force a second over-
time.

This time Davidson took first possession,
and on the third play, Mike Chase hauled in
a 23-yard touchdown pass to make it 38-31.

Offutt leads women’s tennis at Harvard Tournament

By STEVE ALDRICH

Staff Writer

Led by freshman Lindsey Offutt, the
Women’s Tennis team hada very good show-
ing at the 2000 Harvard Fall Invitational.

Offutt, playing in just her second colle-
giate tournament, recorded an impressive
victory over Harvard’s Lara Naqushbandi in
the finals of flight two.

“This was an excellent tournament,” Offutt
said. “This fall has been very productive for
us and it was great to see our hard work pay
off against such good competition.”

Offutt had to defeat two very strong oppo-
nents on her way to her big victory .in the
finals. Offult’s victory in the semi-finals

against Arden Fredeking of Dartmouth was
rather uneventful when compared to her nail-
biting 7-6, 6-4 triumph over Fleur Broughton
of Harvard.

“The competition was excellent,” Offutt
said. “We all did a good job against some
very strong players.”

Head Coach Caroline Price was pleased
with her team’s progress throughout the fall
season. “We had a very strong September,”
Coach Price said. “Our showings at the N.C.
State Invitational and at Harvard are very
positive. We have worked hard and I think
there are some great things that we can build
on for the spring.”

Offutt was not the only Wildeat who had a

good showing in Massachusetts. Junior Forbes

Wildcats extend nation’s best win streak to 12

San Diego couldn’t stop Davidson from
winning its fifth game of the season last
Saturday.

The same can’t be said for the elevator at
the San Diego
Town and
Country Ho-
tel. Almost.

While
leaving the
hotel for the
stadium, four
players, including All-America cornerback
Ryan Crawford, were trapped inside the el-
evator when the door wouldn’t open,

Fortunately for head coach Joe Susan
and the temporarily panicked Wildcats,
Crawford and his mates were able to escape
through an overhead hatch and make it to the
game for kickoff.

“T told them to start stretching in the
elevator,” said Susan. “They showed up in
time to play a pretty good game.” ;

Despite the best efforts of the elevator and
the Torreros of San Diego, Davidson’s Cali-
fornia dreams came true in a 27-13 victory,
the Wildcats 12" straight win dating back to
last season. The 5-0 start is the team’s best
since 1969 season and is just the third time
ever to begin a season with five victories.

Susan credits his team’s success this sea-
son to two’major factors.

*Focus and consistency in practice. “The
kids have done such a great job of making
transitions week-to-week, and not getting to
high after a victory and letting it spill over to
the next week,” he said. .

“We’re fortunate that we have enough skill
to spread the ball around. It makes us harder
to defend.”

In Saturday’s game, quarterback Paul
Nichols sparked the offense, completing 21-
of-33 passes for 285 yards and two touch-
downs.

Receiver Corey Crawford had a career-
high nine receptions and 156 yards and one
touchdown.

Linebacker Bo Henderson had a school-

record four sacks, giving him a school-best

of the Week

25 for his career.

“Bo really came hard with a very powerful,
aggressive rush,” said Susan. “He set the tone
for our defense.”

Crawford blocked his sixth punt to tie a
Division I-AA record for blocked punts in a
season.

In the opening quarter, Davidson domi-
nated both sides of the ball and jumped out to
a 10-0 lead. The defense held San Diego
without a first down and negative yardage.
The offense, meanwhile, had the ball for
12:10 of a possible 15 minutes, gaining 146
yards on 29-plays.

“With San Diego playing primarily man-
to-man defense, we knew we could make
some plays if we could get Nichols some time
to pick them apart,” said Susan. “He made
some very good decisions and hung in there
even under pressure.”

The victory helped Davidson keep pace
with Robert Morris, 17-13 winners over Day-
ton, for the longest winning streak in I-AA at

12 consecutive victories. Nebraska is the
only I-A team with a 12-game win streak.

Thompson played well in a quarterfinal loss
to Cynthia Tow in flight one. Tow was the
eventual winner of the top flight in the tour-
nament. Thompson also teamed with Offutt
to finish fourth in flight one of the doubles
competition. —

There were five schools participating in
the tournament. In addition to Davidson,
Harvard, and Dartmouth, Boston College
and Boston University were also in atten-
dance. There were no overall team results, as
this was strictly a singles and doubles tourna-
ment with separate flights.

The women’s team was 7-13 last spring
and posted a 3-7 record against Southern
Conference competition.
