Union Sore Spot Need Attention

The David Ovens College Union in its
four years of operation has probably been
the recipient of more barbs, good-natured
and otherwise, than any other facet. of
campus life.

But today, even its most vehement de-
tractors will grudgingly admit that while
it still takes a beating in bull sessions,
the Union has come to fill what at one
time was a gaping hole in the overall pro-
gram of the College. It is hard for us
to picture the campus before 1953 when
there was no Union to provide a hub for
student life and activities.

All signs indicate that this growth in
the importance of the Union functions will
continue. Tuesday’s chapel explanation
of the new concept in Union organization,
in which students dominate the scene,
indicates the furtherance of the trend.
New committees are operating this fall in
the realms of travel opportunities, and
round table discussions on timely prob-
lems, both of which should contribute to
the program of service to the community.

But with all the sweetness and light,
there remain the old and legitimate gripes
leveled at the service and food available
in the Snack Bar. The situation has comé
to-a head in recent weeks, with a crossfire
of letters to the editor and general cam-
pus controversy.

It is true as charged that during the
week-night rush hours, service is pitifully

slow, and on Saturday nights, it is impossi-
ble, simply because of insufficient man-
power to handle the crowds. Union of-
ficials are the first to admit this, and
since the beginning of the semester
have been looking desperately without
success for students interested in part-
time employment, in order to plug the

Bap.

The amazing fact is that students
needing work have become almost non-
existent. This seems especially strange in
light of the fact that the College has al-
ways gone to great lengths to provide an
adequate self-help program to assist boys
who need financial aid to complete their
education. Now this number has seeming-

ly diminished to the point where the bulk.

of this phase, at least, of the self-help pro-
gram is going begging.

If all possibilities for securing more
student help have been exhausted. as they
apparently have, the Union should seri-
ously consider hiring one or two more
full-time non-student employees.

Action should be taken immediately
to alleviate this condition, since one sore
spot such as this hurts the entire pro-
gram of the Union in the eyes of the stu-
dent body. It is over the coffee and dough-
nuts that the Union performs one of its
most vital services, and it is imperative
that it be performed as efficiently and
pleasantly as possible.

A.B. Degree Requirements Outmoded

The present program of Davidson Col-
lege leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree
requires the completion of two years of
Latin and/or Greek.

That this requirement no _ longer
meets the demands of modern educational
programs is emphatically emphasized by
the fact. that only eleven men out of the
present Freshman Class of 239 have in-
dicated that they plan to follow the Bache-
lor of Arts program.

The number of men graduating with
a Bachelor of Arts degree at Davidson
has been rather small for a number of
years. The only difference between the
two degrees as far as requirements are
concerned is the necessity for Greek or
Latin to graduate with an A.B. Evidently
most Davidson men agree that there are
other courses here that will be of more
benefit to them than Latin or Greek.

The men who graduate with a bache-
lor of Science degree in history op a
Bachelor of Science degree in English feel
that this distinction between the two de-
grees, based solely on the completion of
two years of Latin or Greek, is somewhat
unfair. They complete the same courses
as those who graduate with an A.B. de-
gree with the exception of this classical
language requirement. Yet they must be
content with a B.S. degree.

It is very interesting to note, too, that
a great many other colleges and univer-
sities do not now require Latin or Greek
for a Bachelor of Arts degree.

A study of some twenty-five colleges
and universities in the United States dis-
closes that only one of these colleges,
Hampden-Sydney College, still requires
completion of a course in Latin or Greek
for a Bachelor of Arts degree.

The colleges and universities in this
study include the University of Alabama,
Amherst, Baldwin Wallace, Bowdoin, The
Citadel, Dartmouth, Duke, Duquesne,
Emory, the University of Georgia, Gettys-
burg, Hampden-Sydney, Harvard, Hollins,
Johns Hopkins, Mercer, the University of
North Carolina, Princeton, Rutgers, Tuffs,
Vanderbilt, Virginia Military Institute,

Wake Forrest, Wesleyan and Yale.

Any change in the present Davidson
degree requirements is up to the Curricu-
lum Committee of the Faculty. Then a
favorable vote by the entire Faculty is
necessary to effect any change.

It is hoped that the Curriculum Com-
mittee will ‘consider a revision in the
present program as soon as possible. It
is further hoped that they will see fit to
change the requirements, ‘so that in the
future English and history.majors who
do not wish to take Latin or Greek will
not forever have to graduate from David-
son with Bachelor of Science degrees.

Need Some Syrup

Since the Snack Bar seems to be the
topic of considerable comment this week,
this might be an opportune time to give

vent to one of. our long-standing pet

peeves.

While the prices are too good to be
true, and the fountain offers good variety,
especially with addition of that grape
juice which took the campus by storm
last spring, there remains the sad fact
that the traditional milkshake 'n ham-
burger, Union style, just don't hold a can-
dle to those available in the Outside
World.

While super-thick milkshakes are the
speciality of the house in down-town estab-
lishments, the Union variety sells at a
piddling rate, simply because they're
lacking something vital. Some say its the
syrup, others blame the insipidity on any
one of a variety of factors.

As for the venerable old hamburger,
the local model is not so venerable, though
not quite the ball of “conjealed grease”
which one writer has suggested.

At any rate, we'd be mighty happy to
see some changes along these lines. A
good juicy hamburger and thick milk-
shake make up for a multitude of reviews
and other sins.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Snack Bar Corps Charges That
Thompson Hit Below Belt

Dear Sir:

We of the Snack Bar felt that
Mr. Thompson was a bit too harsh
in his letter of last week. To start;
Mr. Thompson engages in a little-
below-the-belt mudslinging by call-
ing us the authors of “gross in-
justice and simple stupidity.” Mr.
Thompson ought to inquire about
the facts before making such a
sweeping and severe accusation.

WE APOLOGIZED

We realize that. Mr. Thompson
had to wait a long time for his
two hamburgers and for that we
apoligized several times when we
gave him his hamburgers. Evident-
ly, he wanted more than apologies.

This situation was an extreme
one and in all. probability will not
happen again. The man-in-charge
had car trouble and was late. The
number of workers was few be-
cause few people applied for jobs.
Now, for the first time, Mr. Wil-
son has 4 full corps of workers.

GOT MIXED-UP

As for the numbers situation, we
had only one working, when norm-
ally there are two, on the sand.
wiches and because of the rush
and the change from the end of
one book (No. 100) to another be-
ginning with No. 1, ke got mixed
up. We are sorry about thjs and
we feel sure that Mr. Thompson,
had he been working, would have
made no such error.

PRESIDENT OF THE
STUDENT BODY

The Student Body meeting of
this morning was devoted to a
period of organization for Student
participation in athletic activities
throughout the year.

This was done believing both
that there is a definite place for
school spirit in the lives of stu-
dents and that there is a definite
lack of it here at Davidson. School
spirit is a healthy thing and offers
the opportunity for us as students
to support those who represent
us on the athletic field.

True we are here to learn and
absorb but we also have both the
duty and opportunity to give of
ourselves and contribute to the
welfare of Davidson in any way
we might be capable of doing.

COUNCIL TO STUDY
CURRICULUM

The Student Council will devote
its meeting Monday night to the

Mr. Thompson had to make a re-
mark about the food. In order to
in some way remedy the whole
situation, we would be glad to
have Mr. Thompson work any rush-
ing time.

Immaturity

Dear Sir:

Davidson men have argued, often
unrealistically, that we are on a
par with the Ivy League schools
and that we certainly are the best
in the south. However our level
of maturity fails to bear this out.

MATURITY INVOLVES MORE

Excellence in scholastic exer:
cise is no more a measure of
adulthood ‘than hair on the chest.
Maturity involves much more in
the field of-manners, judgement,
and consistency.

As an institution we are striving
for the balance of personality de-
velopment through the proper in-
tegration of curriculum, social life,
and recreation. But to what goal
are we students moving?

Do we want to become good
examples of the well-rounded Col-
lege Joe when we graduate, or
rather do we wish to be a mature
individual who is equipped mental-

LAWYER FOR TELEPHONE

Davidson Student Government

to investigate the report submitted

Several local businesses and in-
dividuals are also participating in
this venture.

This report deals with the pos-
sibility of placing Davidson on a
direct exchange with Charlotte.

plied for a private line to Char-
lotte since the improbability of the
more ideal system is discouraging
at least for the present. This pri-
vate line has been promised us

ly and socially to cope with the
problems of daily living in a criti-
cal world?

INTO COAT AND TIE

I estimate that 90% of the Da-
vidson graduates step directly from
college into a ‘coat and tie job
(civil or military). In this phase
of day to day. appearances our
practical preparation has not been
simply poor, it has been retarding.

We, “the cream of the south”
as we have been called, are a dis-
graceful, motiey-looking crew from
Monday through Friday, although
our hypocritical weekend appear-
ance is really Ivy League.

By our shoddy appearance. we
not only affront the gentlemen
who are our instructors but also
any visitors on campus, (be it pa-
rents, friends, or guest speakers).

WEL STUDENTS
We do not consider it mature or
praise-worthy of the W&L student
to wear coat and tie every day be-
cause they have no choice.

But how much less worthy is it
of us to choose our sloppiest at-
tire when we have the freedom to
set the styles, and thus the atmos-
phere, at the level of our choice.
Have we made the choice which
would mark us of students on the
“brink of manhood?”

It is not piety nor intellectual-
ism which prompts this criticism,
but a deep feeling that the David-
son Man should exist in fact. It
is common sense for the socialite,
the pre-min., the business man,
or the professional man to prepare
for the type of living which he
will meet.

NEATNESS IS THE WORD

Neatness is the word, not uni-
formity. It is not what you wear,
but how you wear it.

Look to the -men who have at-
tained high rank in the student
body. You rarely see your leaders
with beards, drooping shirt-tails.
and soiled clothing.

Remember, in a society where
you are free to dress as you like,
what you wear is a measure of
what you are.

Thanks to College Union
For Vital Information
Dear Sir:

On behalf of the entire student
body of Davidson College, I would
like to express our appreciation
to the College Union for its small,
but informative sign which boldly
declares: Review Period, October

Were it not for the Union, how
else would we know when to study,
or when to riot?

DEGREE IS MISNOMER

Arts Requirements
Change is Necessary

By PHILIP F. KUKURA

Progressive change has been the
outstanding characteristic of the
attitude and philosophy of David-
son College the past few years.
Liberal forces have been at work
jntroducing basic advances both in
the curricular and non-curricular
activities of the college.

. Vet in the basic program
for the Bachelor degree, the
consummation of four years of
study ef a liberal arts insti-
tution, Davidson adheres to @
policy fong since altered by
most of the leading liberal
arts colleges of the nation, the
requirement of Latin and or
Greek for the Bachelor of Arts
degree.

A survey of degree require-
ments of twenty-nine leading
liberal arts colleges in the South
and the nation—such schools as
Swarthmore, Kenyon, Amherst,
Haverford and the Ivy League col-
leges—showed that only five stipu-
late an ancient language for the
Arts degree, and three of these
five permit the substitution of
mathematics for the language. The
results of this survey definitely
imply that Davidson is behind
other colleges of its type in de-
manding the classical language for
the Arts degree.

The Bachelor of Arts degree is
commonly conferred for work done
in the humanities and social
sciences; the Bachelor of Science
for mathematics, the physical and
biological sciences, and business
administration. Yet with over sixty
percent of last year’s Davidson

Yes, Nat, we display our Adlai

because of the party’s visionary
political principles of liberalism
in economics and elsewhere, and
its boundless depth of superior
leadership.

Rather, it’s because in Adlai
Ewing Stevenson we find a per-
sonality that is young, vigorous,
and agressive, just as America is
young, vigorous, and agressive. In
him we see a leader, not of armies,
but of men and nations — a leader
advancing bravely into a brighter
world of tomorrow.

He catches our imagination, he
makes us think, he leads us to a
new idealism, he reminds us that
by advancing we have progress,
but while. treading water we are
swept downstream and lost in the
abyss of the delta — even the
Egyptian Delta.

On the freshman riot — it was
a fizzie! There was no real leader-
ship or concerted effort in the
class. The class showed typical
freshman reaction when faced
with a dormitory of upperctass-
Men. They were afraid to openly
defy these men or the Court of
Control. This is traditional fresh-
man behavior. The class of 1960
is no exception!

Speaking of these requirements
for the A.B. degree (as everyone
seems to be doing this week) our
humble suggestion would be to
let a year of philosophy separate
the sheep from the goats.

Union staff for the free publicity.
We're hoping with you that there
will be some response to your plea
for “Union” workers. What with
the present salary scale, the many
other “beneficial” ways in which
a Davidson man may dispose of his
“leisure” time, and so forth, we
doubt that you'll have many takers.
Idle workers of the campus arise,
the Union lies in need!

We agree with Truman when he

says he doesn’t believe in public

graduates completing their study
in the humazities “and social
sciences, only fifteen percent were
eligible for the Arts degree as
a result of the classical language
requirement. Thus Davidson is
granting Science degrees to 2a
great majority of her Arts grad-
vates.

A variety of possible solutions
to Davidson’s degree problem pre-
sent themselves. The most obvious
is to take the step that most liber-
al arts colleges have made in the
last fifty years and eliminate the
classical language requirement for
the Bachelor of Arts degree, sub-
stituting a course in philosophy
or the humanities, now a require-
ment in many of the schools in-
eluded in the above survey.
Science degrees could be main-
tained for the traditional Science
courses of study.

Another solution, which is gain-
ing adherents in educational cir-
cles, is to abolish the Bachelor of
Science degree entirely for the
liberal arts college, i. ¢., to give
all graduates an Arts degree, in
effect eliminating the classical
background requirement for the
degree, yet spreading it to the
traditional Science majors.

For the past three years the
Curriculum Committee of the Fac-
ulty has been studying the prob-
lem, and there is some intimation
that a decision will-be forthcoming
in the near future. Sufficient stu-
dent interest in such @ change
might generate enough steam to
get such a change in time for the
Class of ‘52 to profit by it.
