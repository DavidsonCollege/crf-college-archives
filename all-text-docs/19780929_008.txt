“publicit:

Universal and National Lam-tjniversity of Wisconsin at Ma-

poon are throwing a: dozen

: “toga parties”’ in the first week

of Octo : ber on campuses ny inclu-
ding the University of Mary-
land at University Park, the

dison, the University of Colora-
do at Boulder, the University of
Illinois at. Champaign-Urbana,
and the University of California
at Los Angeles.

Evidently, the invitation list
is open. “‘It’ll be free to stu-
dents,'’ said Dannell Torppe, a
publicity spokesman. “‘You’ll
just have to wear a toga.”

-Although college audiences
thus far figure prominently in-
Animal House’s demographics,
Universal apparently feels the
$50,000 plus toga promotion is
needed: Torppe is confident it’ll
work. ‘“‘It’s a good way to make

ne. aware of the movie
“and to make people physically
involved,” he says. “This is a
trend-setting thing.”

_ So far, no one has replied to
the September 15 request for
beer preferences. Have David-
son students turned to the
punch (grain alcohol and Ha-
waiian Punch) typical of ‘‘Ani-
mal House’s”’ toga party craze?

Professors’ kids enjoy DC

To seven members of the
student body, the question
““Why did you decide to go to
Davidson?” is_ probably asked
twice as often as‘is normal.
These students -- Vance Polley,
John Ratliff, John and Cindy
Stroud, Locke White, Helen
White, and Kathy Wolf -- are,
as you can tell by their last
names, sons and daughters of

professors at Davidson.
The fact that they would
remain in the same town and

would be at school with their —

fathers didn’t stop them from
recognizing Davidson’s acade-

mic standing and fine reputa-
tion. In one student’s opinion,
“Davidson is probably the best
choice for the type of educatio

- you get here.”

“ While most of them consi-
dered other schools, Davidson
was top on the list academically
and financially. (Except for
room and board, their tuition is
free.) John Stroud feels that he
‘‘was biased by growing up

around here” but that he owed _

it to himself to look around.
Receiving no pressure from
parents, each student was free
to make up his or her own mind
about choosing a college.

With the exception of Vance
Polley, who is currently audi-
ting Dr. Polley’s ‘‘Introduction
to the Old Testament,”’ none of
these students have ever had a
course from their fathers. ‘They
all seem to agree that having

_ father’s economics class may

‘‘cramp his style,’’ as Dr.
dotes to the class. :

While walking through the

halls of Chambers, one cannot
help but hear numerous criti-
cisms (and occasionally compli-
ments) about the professors.
While aware that their fathers
are labeled with descriptive
nicknames like “Max the Ax”

Polley, most of the faculty kids
have never heard any truly
remarks about their

fathers as professors.

Locke White is frequently
informed by scholarship reci-
pients that they ‘‘neéd more
money. from his ol’ man;” other
faculty kids occasionally receive
comments from friends about
“getting burned” by their fa-
All of the faculty kids live in
either a dorm or an off-campus
house except Vance Polley, who

though they are still in the same

themselves as much as possible

SQUAD MEMBER Rene Hedgepeth uses the skills she learned at
camp and leads cheers for the Wildcats.

...Practice pays off

(Continued from page 6)

The Squad obtained new uni-
forms, went to camp at the Uni-
versity of Tennessee in Knox-
ville, and got the green light on
transportation to out of town
football games.

Camp was both an educa-
tional and enjoyable experience.
Says Rene Hedgepeth, new to
the squad, ‘‘the guys partied
every night and called us party
poopers because we wouldn't
join them. We were too tired
and sore from the day’s work.”

Oldtimers agree that camp
brought the squad closer toge-
ther than ever before as a
functioning unit. Back at Da-
vidson, the group practices
twice a week for several hours.
Their work shows.

Speaking with conviction,
Crosby said, “We're the best
squad Davidson has ever. seen.

We are practicing more than
ever before. We use new cheers
from the National Association.
of Cheerleaders. We are doing

. Pyramids never conceived of.”’

While keg contests at the
football games result in in-
creased crowd support, the
squad has stopped the contest.
People cheer for the kegs, not
the team, they complain.

The guy in the Wildcat cos-
tume who asked not to be iden-
tified, said that crowd support ©
is not equal to that of last year.

The cheerleaders have some
‘surprises up their sleeve that
are worth seeing.

Brown remains jock

Editor’s Note—This is the
first in a series featuring David-
son lettermen who, as alumni,
have continued their athletic
pursuits after graduation. _
For the last four years,
Davidson baseball fans mar-
velled at the tall center fielder

fly balls sailing all the way from
