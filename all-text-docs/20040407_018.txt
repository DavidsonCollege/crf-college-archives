Lacrosse remains winless in
conference on 0-2 Ohio trip

The lacrosse team traveled to Ohio this past

, weekend to play conference rivals Ohio Uni-

versity and Ohio State and came away encour-
aged by their play despite two tough losses.

On Friday, the ’Cats faced the Ohio Bob-
cats at Pruitt Field, losing 16-7. The Bobcats
started the game by scoring five unanswered
goals in the first 10:30. After ten scoreless
minutes of play, Lindsay Frank ’05 finally put
Davidson on the board at the 9:24 mark.

The Bobcats retaliated within the minute to
re-establish their five-goal cushion, and Bran-
don Jacobs ’05 notched Davidson’s final two
goals of the half for an 8-3 score at intermis-
sion.

Although Jacobs, Frank, and Eloise Grose
*06 each scored two goals, their performance
was not enough to hold off the Bobcats.

Ohio capitalized on the Wildcat mistakes
and dominated most of the play, forcing 22
turnovers to their nine. The Bobcats dominated
the face-offs as well, with OU tallying 17 draw
controls to Davidson’s seven. In the goal for
the Cats, Leslie Smith ’06 has 13 saves on
their 35 shots, while the Bobcats keeper had
eight saves on 19 shots.

Head coach Heather Bliss commented on

the day’s performance, “There were moments
of great lacrosse out on the field today. Un-
fortunately for us, Ohio capitalized on our
mistakes, changing the momentum of the
game. Our focus for the next game will be to
do what Ohio did to us today, and exploit the
weaknesses and turnovers of our opponents.”

The ’Cats then traveled to Columbus to play
Ohio State on Sunday. The match started with
an explosion of Buckeye goals, with Ohio
State scoring six straight in the first fifteen
minutes of play.

Kiften Stephens ’06 notched Davidson’s
first goal of the day on an assist from Frank
with fourteen minutes remaining in the first
period, but the Buckeyes responded by scor-
ing another three unanswered goals. Whitney
Deifendorf ’06 lessened the gap, scoring for
the ’Cats with one minute remaining in the
period, but the score remained 9-2 at the half.

In the second half, however, the Wildcats
used some impressive play to keep pace with
the Buckeyes. Jacobs scored the first goal of
the second half off a free position shot, but
the Buckeyes again responded by scoring three
goals in the next three minutes.

College game all elementary
for tennis’ Katie Levitt ’07

First-year star named
SoCon Player of the Month
after 12-1 record in March

By Witson McCrory

For Kate Levitt ’07, the transition to col-
lege hasn’t been about the higher level of ten-
nis, the demanding practices, or the road-trips
to Chattanooga and Charleston. Instead, the
hardest part for Levitt, who was recently
named the Southern Conference’s Athlete of
the Month for women’s tennis in March, has
been adjusting to the workload.

“The work here is

less work ethic and a never-say-die attitude
for each point: “I love fighting for each point,
and my movement is pretty good.”

Still, she continues to work on all aspects
of her game, including “Coming to the net,
playing more volleys, and just stepping up
more.”

Also, while Levitt has been a force on the
singles side, she hopes to eventually contrib-
ute as both a singles and doubles player for
the team. “I’ve been able to play doubles a
few times this year, but my partner Shelby
[Rooke ’07] is injured right now, and all three
doubles teams have been playing together
since they were freshmen. I’d like to eventu-
ally play more, but I don’t want to mess up
that chemistry right now, either.”

Still, Levitt’s con-

a lot more than I was
used to doing in high
school,” says Levitt,
who was much more
prepared for the col-
lege-level tennis she
has faced during her
first year on campus
than the myriad of
reading assignments,
problem sets and pa-
pers routinely handed
out by Davidson pro-
fessors.

“I didn’t know
what to expect com-

lege”

“TI just wanted to come in
and play my game and try
to help the team. I felt like I
could do that, since I was
used to playing touch
matches coming in to col-

sistency on the court
has been an integral
part of the team’s
record-breaking
start, with her unde-
feated conference
mark contributing to
a team-record seven
SoCon victories for
the Wildcats.
“We’re really
happy with how
we’ ve done as a team
so far, and I think
we’re really close as
a group,” she says of

ing in here, but I just

wanted to come in

and play my game and try to help the team. I
felt like I could do that, since I was used to
playing touch matches coming in to college.
I’ve been playing in tournaments since I was
11 years old, so I’ve traveled around the coun-
try playing in competitive matches outside of
just high school tennis.”

Levitt’s confidence was not misplaced, ei-
ther, as her success to date speaks for itself.
She’s 21-9 in her first season, going 13-2 over
her last fifteen matches at the fourth and fifth
singles positions. In March, her 12-1 record,
which included a ten-match win streak and a
perfect conference mark, garnered the SoCon
Athlete of the Month award.

“That kind of award is pretty encouraging,”
she says, “‘and I feel honored to receive it.
Also, something like that just gives me that
much more confidence on the court.”

Levitt’s success on the court is fueled by a
strong backhand and serve, as well as a tire-

Three runners take first in weekend meets

This past weekend, the track and field team
sent small contingents to both the Duke Invi-
tational and the Furman Invitational.

The Duke Invitational featured the men’s
5K and 10K races. The races were run in
Duke’s enormous stadium, filled with lots of
empty spaces and about a dozen or so specta-
tors. ,

The 5K was run first, and Ben Gaspar ’04
led the pack, looking strong over the last mile
en route to a personal best 15:08.07.

Jonathan Baker ’06 was tripped up halfway
through the race, and he fell hard to the track,
yet he still managed to finish in 15:19.57.

The 10K was arace of attrition, with Chris
Schmader ’04 wearing down his opponents
using his consistent splits and short, efficient
stride. He set a big personal best of 32:01.50
for the 25-lap race.

The Furman invitational saw more notewor-
thy results. Co-captain Andrew Pratt ’04 set
an impressive personal best in the 400-meter
dash, running the distance in' 50.50 seconds

“We all motivate and

With matches remaining against Wofford
and SoCon-leading Furman, Levitt and the rest
of the ’Cats will
look to set another

2004 season: their
first Southern
Conference title.
Winning both
matches would
give them their
title.

they are certainly up for that challenge. Then
Levitt will return to the books, the true chal-
