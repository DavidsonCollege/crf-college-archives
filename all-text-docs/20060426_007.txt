By PAIGE TAYLOR

Dance enthusiasts, brace yourselves. This
semester, post-Dance Ensemble, there is still

a chance to catch some amazing moves com-_

pletely disassociated from the debauchery of
Spring Frolics.

The North Carolina Dance Theatre,
Charlotte’s own professional ballet compa-
ny, will soon play host to.an unprecendented
show at the city’s Belk Theatre. To celebrate
its 35th anniversary, the company is bringing
to town the works of three of America’s top
dance choreographers. Called “American
Genius,” the show features the works of
Jerome Robbins, Alvin Ailey and George
Balanchine, combining them into
one production that is sure to thrill “
audiences.

The first piece of the show features
dances from the musical “Fancy Free,” set
in New York City in the

1940s. yy
Choreographed by Jerome Robbins and 4¥™.
first released in 1944, the jazzy piece

features scores from the
famous and prolific com-
poser Leonard Bernstein. '
Culminating in high-energy
“dance offs” between three ©
sailors competing for the affec-
tions of two ladies they meet while
out on the town, the ballet is '
regarded as one of Robbins’ .,._
greatest achievements. ERS
While not as widely known & /
as his work in “West Side .9
Story,” “Fancy Free” is sure | { §
to appeal to those of all Jy
ages. It even inspired the .
hit movie “On the Town”

Sailors vie
for the attention
of two women in
the dance piece

from Robbin’s
“Fancy Free”

starring Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, which
remains a classic favorite of movie musical
enthusiasts to this day.

Along with Robbin’s jazzy numbers from
“Fancy Free,” the show features performanc-
es from “The River” by Ailey, America’s
predominant and world-renowned African-
American choreographer.

The namesake for the famous dance
school and ballet company based in New
York City, Ailey created 79 ballets over the
course of his lifetime.

“The River,” set to the music of jazz great
Duke Ellington, will be performed by mem-
bers of the North Carolina Dance Theatre en
pointe. This is a very rare and extraordinary
way to present such a jazz piece.

- Anna Kisselgoff, dance critic
».’ for the “New York Times,” praised
the North Carolina Dance Theatre’s
2004 performance of “The River” as a
. “powerful, polished, and engaging
show.”

The final piece in the
production features the
choreography of the

renowned New York City

. Adding a dash of the
classical to “American
Genius,” Balanchine’s
“Violin Concerto,”
featuring the musical
, compositions of Igor
*... Stravinsky, ends the
production on a
, symphonic high
note.

Carolina Dance Theatre promises to wow
audiences with gorgeous technique and three
separate ballets that have defined American
theater as we know it.

The show runs from May 4 through 6 at
the Belk Theatre in the Bluementhal
Performing Arts Center, located in down-
town Charlotte. Tickets are available online.

So, find time to squeeze in some culture
during the stressful semester’s end, especial-
ly if you’ve got family, friends, or a signifi-
cant other paying a visit.

Otherwise, the only type of dancing you
might find around here this time of year is
seniors skipping down the aisles at gradua-
tion.

Condoms, from page 6

room first aid kit or the health center, in the
baskets containing what is often miscon-
strued as candy. Condoms are also quite easy
to carry.

Men, you can slide one into your wallet,
and women, you can pop one in your purse.
Yes, ladies, you can carry them too.

Condoms can also be sexy. Most of those
surveyed agreed that sex is not any less
enjoyable with them, even if some respon-
dents, usually men, stated that they “reduce
pleasure.”

However, sex would be incredibly less
enjoyable if you were to contract an STD.

It is also important to get tested for STDs.
If you do not get tested for yourself, at least
do it for your partner.

Condoms, while a serious subject, can
admittingly be funny at times.

STDs, however, are never a laughing mat-

ter.
