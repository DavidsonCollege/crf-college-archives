Seniors’ Fete

Despite Rain, Many Come To
Senior Open House |

Despite the fact that the rain
came down in torrents and that |
there were three or four other so-'
cial events scheduled for Thursday
afternoon, the Open Pouse in the;
dormitorics was largely attended
and proved to be a great Success.

The first floor of each of ‘the five
dormitories was open from 4 until
6 for inspection, thus making the |
affair a little more elaborate than
the jirst attempt of last year when
only the first floors of Georgia and
Watts dorms were open to the visi-
tors. oe

Members of the Senior Class serv-
ed as ushers for the occasion under
the supervision of Torrey McLean.
At 6 o'clock, all the visitors met in
the parlor of Watts for refresh-
ments and all approved of the idea
of having Open House ence each
year.

Faculty Visits

Awong the visitors were the mem-
bers Of the faculty, their wives,
ands many outside visitors niost of
whom were parents of the boys.
Last year at the first Open House
there.were over one hundred guests,
but not even the rain kept them
back Thursday when approximate-
ly 175_friends turned out for the
occasion.

True to its purpose of giving par-
ents an opportunity to see just ex-
actly how the Davidson students
live, and to enable the students to
play host to the townspeople of
Davidson once each year. Mrs.
Smith has decided to firmly estab-
lish this custom on the campus.

The local chapter of Delta Phi
Alpha and the German Ctub met ;
fast. Friday nighe at the home of
Professor Ernest A. Reaty for. a!
joint meeting. At the opening of
the mecting a number of German |

'gnotations were givemzand Field __

Professor Schenck spoke on the
“Vahie of German. in Graduate
Work.” An informal discussion as
to how the fraternity might be im-
proved was held during the feed.

Election of the new officers ‘for
the coming year will be held at a
meeting this week. '
