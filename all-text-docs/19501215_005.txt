Generals Possess
Much of Material
That Won Title

The Davidson wrestling team
will open its 1950-51 season this
Monday at 8:00 p. m. by playing
host to Washington and Lee, who
have been Southern Conference
wrestling champions for the last
three years.

The Generals will send practically
the same squad it has had since
the 194748 season to the mat
Monday night. Coach Charlie Park-
er will counter with lettermen John.
ny Kelton, Bob Gay, Bill McNeely,
and Shorty LaFar. Gene Craven,
Bucky Irvin, Mac Doubles, and
Jerry Morrow move up from the
freshman ranks to aid the varsity.

Johnny Kelton, who placed third
in the 128 pound class in the South-
ern Conference last year, will cap-

tain the squad, which is almost:

certain to better last years record
of only two victories made during
the entire year, both of which
were made during the spring sea.
son.
The probable lineup—
Gene Craven, 123 pound class.
Johnny Kelton, 130 pound class.
Jim Grissom, 137 pound class.
Bucky Irvin or Shorty Lafar,
147 pound class. °
Mac Doubles, 157 pound Class.
Bob Gay, 167 pound class.
Jerry Morrow, 177 pound class.
Lee Talbert, Heavyweight class.

Girks who give all their time,

To write a boring thesis,

May have to give up love and
joy,

And be content with nieces.

KA, Phi Delt, SAE and Sigma Chi Post Victories
In Second Week Of Interfrat Basketball Action

The basketball season rolled into
its second week with some of the
most rough and tumble play yet to
be seen. A fast break or a top notch
rebound team seem to be the es.
sentials for a winner this year. The
Phi Delts and SAE’s appear to
running their opponents dizzy wi
their fast breaking, while se
other top teams have been control-
ling the backboards. Although only
a few games will have been played
before the Christmas holidays, it is
certainly apparent that this sea-
son’s play will be up to very high
standards.

KA’s 34-Pi Kappe 24

The KA’'s, sparked by Dan Mc.
Keithan’s set shots, rolled easily
to their second victory by beating
a strong Pi Kapp team 34-24. The
Pi Kapps, who recently had rolled
up a tremendous score in their open-
ing game, were not able to control
the rebounds as well as the KA’s did
and this was the margin of victory.
McKeithan with 8 points and Nall
with 7, were the high point men

for the two teams.

Phi Delt’s 61-SPE’s 22

A constantly moving fast break
was too much for a bewildered SPE
team as the Phi Delts went to an

-| easy victory. Bill Bivins and Al

Cook tied for high point honors for
the winners, while Yale Greer was
high for the SPE’s with 6.

SAE's S4.Phi Gams 35

The SAE’s came back from a first-
half deadlock to literally run the
Phi Gams off the court, with their
fast break. The half ended with
a 21-21 score, but the game closed
in a far different way. For the
winners A. C. Gregg was high point
man with 14. For the losers Hunter
Strader. got 8 points to lead the
way.

lethal left pushes in those perfect
shots and is his best friend on the
floor. He also is as tricky as blazes
and breaks and drives with tre.
mendous power and finesse toward
the goal. His work on defense is
commendable also, and is best
pointed out by the many times he
practically steals the ball from +

toward his goal.

pose of the college. The purpose of any college is to train men in
the field of their choice, and also in the spiritual, cultural, and
physical.

_ 2. I doubt that money can be made out of football, my
objection being on the ground that to get better players you
need more money, to get more money vou need a bigger gate,
a bigger gate will mean a bigger stadium—it is a vicious circle.
What's more, Davidson is in a keenly competitive area for the
undertaking’ of an economical gain from football. and I cite
the nearness of the ‘‘Big Faour,’’ etc., with Wake Forest com-
ing even nearer.

3. The statement that a winning (subsidized) team helps
to get endowment funds is unfounded. Many schools not having
«x program aimed at ‘‘bigtime.’’ have better endowments and
larger budgets than Davidson College.

4. When it is stated, and it is a familiar quote by those
proponents of the subsidy, that they want to “bring to Davidson
only those bright boys who would come to Davidson anyway,’’
thev are only kidding themsleves. We have failed to make a
success in football before with ‘bright boys’? who ‘‘normal-
ly’? eame to Davidson.

5. They also say that they “just want to win our share,
like we used to.’’ From 1896-1945 Davidson lost 46 per cent of
all its football games, tied 10 per cent. conference AND non-
conference. For example, we have lost 63 per cent of our games
with State and 63 per cent of our games with Furman.

6. Subsidization places an emphasis on something not
fundamentally a part of the purpose of a college,

7. Subsidization kills the sport for the boys who ‘“normal-
lv come to Davidson.’ The unreeruited athlete is overlooked in
the rush.

8. The financial part of this big-time business would do
away with all home games on the campus. The stadiim wouldn’t
hold the crowd.

9. More important than any of thé points bronght ont be-
fore. a subsidized sports program will lead toa petversion‘of the
true purpose of education. Henee the problem becomes a moral
one. This point of view is clavified in The Christian Century,”
February 1, 1950. (Dr Gallent brought out that a copy was
available in the library for all who wished to read it—bEul.)’

10. There is no easy solution ta the problem. Anyone
attempting to solve the problem will have to be willing to ae-
cept a certain amouit of criticism, but in the king run he will
emerge an educational hero. The cold truth of the matter is
that few, if any, have made a determined effort ro selve the
problem. ] would offer in conclusion, two possible solutions:

Solution A: The coaches and adininistrative officers of a
small group of small colleges begin to try to. ayeanize a small
conference. Even if it had only four sehdols playing each other
twice a season on the home-nid-home basis. it would be a good
start. This program: would be unsubsidized.

Solution B: Drop out of intercollegiate athletics altogether.
