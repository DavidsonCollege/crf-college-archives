Heroes Emerge in All Wienie Team

Selected by the aforemen-
tioned, this team consists of
those b-ball stars who have
reached the heights of the dog
and mustard scene with their
unnecessary public displays of
relish and onions on their ever-
present buns.

Leading off this year’s first
team is the man who is often
hearlded as the most sought af-
ter head case’ canter
Louisville’s Wesley Cox. No one
knows what or why Wesley is
goint to do, but you can be sure
you won’t understand it:

Wesley goes down to the end
of the bench after asking to be
taken out and pretends he is
persecuted by thousands. Yes,
Mr. head case, you.are the All
Weinie center.

The forward spots are nailed
down quite securely by two
young corner gunners, Soph
Adrian Dantly of Notre Dame
and freshman hot dog Steve
Sheppard of Maryland.

Dantly, the most protected
player in America holds a
degree in theatre arts from
tersville Junior College. He has
two years ahead of him and will
continue to be encased in a bun,
if he doesn’t overdo his act on
the court and dies.

Oh, by the way, he sure looks
Catholic doesn’t he; Irish too?

Sheppard is going to be a
great one. He has all the moves,
but his piece of resistance is the
clinched fist after each time he
scores. This happens only once
or twice a game so we suggest
he broaden this gesture to each

time he shoots so_the fans can
get sick to their stomachs more
often.

The guard spots are tight for
the first four guards, but frosh
Jackie Gillon of S. Carolina and
Phil ‘‘four corners’ Ford of
N.C. are the first team selec-
tions.

Gillon is a turkey who was
“designated John Roche’’ for
S.C. but he couldn’t fill those big
buns this early in the year. He
will only get better, cause he is
whole meat without a doubt.
Gov’t. inspected.

Ford is Dean  Smith’s
progidy...what else can we say?
He has a great tradition of UNC
dogs to follow with your Georgie
Karls, Steve Previs, and
Darrell Elston, but he per-
formed admirably all year long.
He-is a weinie’s weinie ca va?

Freshweinies certainly
dominate the first squad but the
honorable mention squad is
loaded with vets. The exception
is that fine hot dog from
Raliegh, Kenny Carr.

Kenny is the only person in
the world who thinks Kenny
Cafr is better than David Thom-
pson. This strange belief un-
doubtedly led to the Wolfpack’s
early exit from NCAA com-
petition.

We have two seniors as our
‘honorable mention wienie cen-
ters. First that UNC mustard
man, Ed Stahl.

Ed_ specializes in_ steel
burgers and cheerleading. His
only flaw is his inavility to
' master the ‘(Newland Stomp”’
during warmups. Besides that
C.A.. is still mad at Easy Ed for
being named the 1971 Ohio High
School Player of the Year in-
stead of C.A.

Tessor Leonard? You all
know it, Furman knows it,

anyone who’s seen him knows
it, Tessor don’t know it though.
Yes sports fans, Tessor is all
dumb-MUP.

Our honorable mention for-
wards are two well known per-

sonages. David Myers, who is
not only all ugly and all zit, but
he is probably the ugliest
player to participate in tne
NCAA since Al Taber.(For you
tender frosh; Al was UGLY.

Sorry Dave but it is as it was
written, right evil Abbo?

The other forward is Stan
Bakovitch of West Virginia, but
our scouting reports only say
‘“‘who?’’ so we named him to our
All Who Team. Great job, ah,
er...Stan.

We have four guards at the

Pete Turgovich is the most
hearlded flop since Andre Mc-
Carter but that’s another star-
ter. Yes UCLA’s guards are
human but so what? They will
still win it all.

Lloyd Walton of Marquette is
honorable mention because of

his ability to shoot instead of -

getting the ball to Bo Ellis, He is
street ball all the way.

Brad Hoffman and Monte

¢ IT PAYS TO GO TO MEETINGS ”

7 and a guy named D.T.
+

But, this is just a kind gesture
to a man who is a shadow of
what he once was. (That ain’t
much, folks.)

Brad Hoffman just didn’t

tender.

Bobby suppossedly believes
that Vince Lombardi was a
“faggot and a loser’’ and that

~\__ his teams were poor cause Lom-

bardi wasn’t tough enough.
I almost forgot, Bobby’s ac-

have the talent to do anything complishments include “Head

but Dean liked him so that?

Now the big question, who is
‘the All Wienie coach? Who
cares? No, really, almost all
college coaches are either
frustrated jocks, egomanians,
or just emotionally crippled.
Picking the head wienie out of
all that material is very dif-
ficult.

Among the nominees are Fur-
man’s banana man _ Joe
Williams, Norm Sloan, and his
canary voiced wife. Bobby
Knight, all spastic is a top con-

Psycho 1970’’; ‘Most Demented
Team Ever, Army 1968’’ and a
written invitation to return to:
the funny farm anytime he wan-
ts.

The ‘winner, though, is.that
pleasant man from Andefson,
S.C., Tates Locke. Tates is also
all outlaw and all cheater
squad. Rumor has it that Clem-
son will be put on probation
forever for their . illegal
recruiting.Couldn’t happen to a
nicer bunch of guys. Tates also
treats chairs sweetly.

Well th-th-th-that’s all folks.
