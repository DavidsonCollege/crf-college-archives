New Form of Inter-Class Con-
tests to be Carried on

Sponsored by Collee

Competition in Fall and Spring
Track, Boxing, Volley Ball
Basketball, and Baseball to

be Offered

The spirit of Davidson College comes
from its four classes. Knowing this the
college authorities are endeavoring to in-
stall a new form of inter-class competi-
tion which includes a great variety, of
sports.

In order to do this, the authorities are
depending upon the spirit of each ‘class
to make the movement a success, and
the class which defeats the teams of its
three rivals receivés a loving cup with
the class numeral engraved upon it.

The six branches of sport open to class
competition are: Fall track, boxing, vol-
ley-ball, Spring tack meet, Basket-ball
and baseball. The first of these is al-
ready in inter-class competition. Basket-
ball as played by the classes has he-
come a success because of the interest
it has aroused.

The cup is to be presented to the class
which has the highest average of points
won in the total number of sports of the
six which are open to class competition.
The plan prevents any class winning on
account of its superiority in one branch
of athletics. Thus is the chance of win-
nihg evenly divided among the four class-
es.

Boxing, a new thing at Davidson, is
rapidly drawing the interest of the classes
and each now has its representatives in
training for the coming tournament.

Volley-ball, hitherto unknown sport at
Davidson, has rapidly become popular.

The Spring track meet will come at
the regular time for Varsity track sea-
son and can very easily be arranged:
Baseball is a very popular sport and is
drawing many, as, is witnessed by those
who go out every afternoon. This class
competition is going far towards pro-
moting athletics here at Davidson and is
being entered into with a great deal of
spirit.

‘MICHENOT SPEAKS
ON FRENCHAUTHOR

French Scholar Addresses Crowd
of Students in Shearer Hall

Speaking in French to a rather large
gathering of students in Shearer Hall
Monday night, M. Daniel Michenot,
French scholar and lecturer, gave an in-
teresting address on the subject “Un Ro-
mantique Moderne: Edmond Rostand.”
M. Michenont developed this topic by re-
viewing rather briefly the life and works
of the eminent French’ playwright and
poet, Rostrand, and by then reading a
number of outstanding selections from his
writings. Among these were “Le Grand
Nez” and “Non Merci” from Cyrano de
Bergerac, a selection from “Chanticleer,”
and a poem by Rostand.

M. Minchenot is a lecturer of the Al-
liance Francaise, and it was through ar-
rangement with this group by the local
chapter of Le Cercle Francais and the
faculty committee on lectures that he was
brought to Davidson. M. Michenot,
who has made lecture tours through Swit-
zerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland
and Canada, is now on his second similar
trip through the United States.

M. Michenot brought with him a mes-
sage of friendship to the American peo-
ple from Georges Clemenceau of whom
he is a personal friend.

. Dr. G. B. Watts, of the French De-
partment of the college, made a few in-
troductory remarks in French before M.
Michenot spoke. C. J. Albright, Presi-
dent of the Cercle Francais, presented the
speaker.

Basketball Sweaters

From funds received by the
contributi from student at-
tendants at the Davidson-Duke

day night sweaters will be bought

This followed a motion made by
John Currie and accepted by the
student body at chapel Thurs-
day morning.

WALKER HEARD AT
Y VESPER SERVICE

Pastor of State College Presby-
terian Church Talks to
Students

“Christianity calls for more than mo-
ments of emotional uplift,” said Rev.
Joseph Walker, pastor of State College
Church in Raleigh, and graduate of Da-
vidson College in addressing the students
at Y. M. C. A. Vespers last Sunday night.

will make you do His will.”

Mr. Walker todk as his text the last
chapter of John where is depicted the
story of the miraculous drgught of fish
and especially Jesus’ subséquent conver-
Vay He thrice asked
‘whether he loved Him. Here are
ywkserved by an eye-witness the finest de-
ails—even the nuniber of fish, one hun-
dred and fifty-three.

The high hopes of the disciples had
been crushed by Christ's death. Jesus had
promised them a great mission but they
didn't know what it was. At this moment
when the problem proved too great for
them, Peter, the leader, said that he was
going fishing and the others followed him.
“There is no more human touch in the
Bible than this, when the disciples facing
a blank wall turned to fishing,” said Mr.
Walker. You can imagine how Peter
felt when he recognized his Master on
the shore in the morning when you con-
sider that he had no opportunity to con-
his sin of denial. Impetuously he
dove in the water and swam to shore. No
man knows what passed between Peter
and Jesus then, but Peter must have con-
fessed and received forgiveness.

fess

After breakfast it must have seemed
to Peter that Jesus was re-opening his
wound when He asked whether he loved
Him more than the others. The secret
of this passage lies in the different words
for love used by Jesus and Peter in the
Greek. The word used by Jesus implies

Lmore nearly “Do you hold me in a deep

The word that
Peter used refers more to an emotional
love. In His last question Jesus uses
Peter’s own word. The lesson that Jesus
was trying to drive home was evidently
that what He wanted was love that would
make a man “Feed my sheep.” Peter
probably thought that his emotional love
was better than that constant love that
Jesus was asking of him, just as a young
married couple think that their own more
demonstrative emotion deeper than
that felt by an aged couple who ‘have
faced together for years life’s sorrows
and joys. Later Peter came to realize
this and by his life came to deserve his
name Peter—rock.

and abiding regard?”

is

What Jesus “wants of us is this same
sort of love that will make us do Wis
work no matter how we feel. In all walks
of life men can carry the knowledge of
Christ to others and offer themselves as
faithful and earnest workmen in the
work of the’Church which sadly needs
men who don’t have to stop work as
soon as they forget the last sermon.

The feed which was held at the Max

about eighty-five or ninety members of
the class. The purpose of the party was
two-fold—first, to provide a medium
through which the members of the class
might gain a closer feeling of fellowship;
and second, to discuss matters pertinent
to the general good of college and class.

After the blessing which was asked by
Craig Frye the men enjoyed a sumptuous
feed. During the meal the guests were
most agreeably entertained with music
furnished by the Jazz Orchestra. Just
after the spread the whole gathering
joined in singing, “Oh Davidson” and

Following the feed the class went into
a general discussion at which time sev-
eral important matters were brought up.
M. T. Gilmour, president of the class,
complimented it for its success and urged
that it continue its good work. At this
juncture Lake made his motion and went
on to say that such behavior was more
in keeping with that of prep schools than
with that of gentlemen and students of
Davidson College.

Lake expressed the opinon that if this
action was taken by the senior class the
other classes would follow their precedent.
Later a discussion about the senior party
was held. E. R. McConnell, R. R. Kane,
H. A. Knox, G. H. Green, S. L. Black
and others expressed their approval of
the party and urged that.the seniors take
advantage of it and make it a success.
The program of the party was read by
M. T. Gilmour, who asked for a show
of hands as to the number of girls who
were coming up for the social event.

The smoker was closed with “College

gathering...
