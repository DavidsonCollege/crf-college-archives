THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 2, 1934

CINDERMEN MEET
DUKE SATURDAY

In The Field of Sports

WOFFORD TRAMPLED
BY TRACK MEN

As you have no doubt noticed the

name for this column has _ been
changed; not because of the stern re-
jection “ The Broadcaster” made to our
shots while “Firing at Random,” but
for the simple reason that it has be-
come a custom to make such an altera-
tion every year with the beginning
of a new regime on the editorial staff
of the Davidsonian. Then, too, variety
is the spice of life, and at present this
section. needs all of the life and spice
it can get.
To those readers who are not
very familiar with the places and
+ things on the Davidson campus,
this guy Felix is the feline mascot
of Davidson athletic teams. He
resides in an octagonal cage near
the north side of the college gym-
nasium, and one has immediate
proof of his wildness by going near
the den where a steady growl of
discontent can be heard, and four
paws well fortified with fierce-
looking scratchers, and an occa-
“sional toothy grin, which displays
a nice set of grinders that could
rent almost any kind of flesh
asunder, can be seen. The reason
we use this fellow’s name in the
coulmn head is becatise he has
about the best perspective of the
Wildcat’s layout of anyone in the
neighborhood, so to give to the
readers what he sees would be cov-
ering the entire lair with an au-
thoritative eye. Credit for the
above drawing goes to Howell
Overton; one of the members of
that renowned centennial class,
who are at present classified as
freshmen.
It was extremely disappointing for
the many interested fans to see Jimmy
’ Halverstadt, Davidson’s star racquet-
wielder, suffer such a terrific drubbing
at the hands of Barney Welch, the
Duke star who lost to Jimmy in the
finals of the state tourney. Not once
during the entire match did the Wild-
cat ace show even a smattering of
championship form. Welch was de-
cidedly his master throughout the bat-
tle, making some very beautiful place-
ment shots and oftentimes, by the
steadiness and precision of his play,
forcing Jimmy to drivechis returns out
of court. The ’Cats showed up in bet-
ter style, however, against the Tar
Heels Saturday, even though they
dropped the deciding match in the
state team-championship to the Caro-
linians.

The Wildcat batsmen yielded to
the Blue Devils twice last week in
a pair of rather close games, Both
of the Davidson pitchers, West and
Jenkins, hurled jam-up ball, but a
host of errors accompanied with
an evident lack of :team spirit, lost
both of these contests for the Fe-
lines. Jenkins in the d en-
gagement gave the Dukes only
four safe blows, but the Durham
lads made them good for the same
number of runs, so the ragged
fielding and absence of pep on the
part of the players can surely be
blamed for this defeat.

Captain Pritchett’s proteges had a
nice day of competition on the cinders
among themselves Saturday afternoon
when the Wofford Terriers eked only
19 points out of the Wildcats, who gar-
nered 107, Earle Frazier’s stellar per-
formance in the mile run was partic-
ularly outstanding. He covered the
distance jn 4 minutes, 30.1 seconds,
which slices more than six seconds off
-his_own_record_established—earlier_in
the season. If this sophomore con-
tinues to lower the time for the four-
lap run, at his present rate, Davidson

Morgan and Smyre Outstanding
for Wildcats

In a series of two games played at
Durham last Wednesday and Thurs-
day, the Duke Blue Devil basebalt
team emerged victorious over the
hard-fighting Davidson Wildcats, win-
ning the first contest 5 to 1, and the
second 4 to 2.

In the first of the series of games,
played on Wednesday, Duke bunched
six hits, including Pitcher Ken Weaf-
er's home run, and three-base hits by
Wagner, Huiskamp and Weaver, to
chalk up an early victory for the uni-
versity team. Morgan accounted for
Davidsons’ only run,

Weafer allowed. only five hits and
three of these were made in the sev-
enth. Julian West pitched an excel-
lent game for-the 'Cats, but the Duke
attack in the third inning put the
game on ice. Wagner, opposing catch-
er, with a triple and two singles, led
the Blue Devils in the hitting depart-
ment.

00 100—1

Duke marked up their second victory
over the Wildcats Thursday afternoon
by scoring two runs in the eighth in-
ning on a walk and consequently
breaking a 2-2 tie. Two errors and a
stolen base in the second inning ac-
counted for the Dukes’ first two runs,
while a two-base hit by Smyre and a
one-bagger by Wingfield brought the
score to a tie, which lasted until the
eighth inning.

A beautiful mound duel was staged
between Jenkins of Davidson and
Naktenis and May of Duke. Jenkins
allowed the Blue Devils only four hits,
three of these being scratches, but the
poor support afforded him kept the
game from being a victory for the
‘Cats.

Davidson Man Triumphs
In State Golf Tourney

Bill Snow, of Davidson, and his part-
ner, Jack Toomer, formerly of Jack-
sonville, Fla., recently won the. pro-
amateur event of the Carolinas Open
Championship tournament held at the
High Point Country Club on Wednes-
day, April 25.

The play in this event was by medal
score. A professional and an amateur
were paired together and only their
best ball counted. Snow and his pro-
fessional partner, Toomer, turned in
a total of 66 on the first round, six
below par on the par seventy-two
course.

Later in the afternoon Gene Mills
and his amateur partner, Rodney War-
ner, both of Raleigh, turned in a 66
to tie for first place. The tournament
committee ordered a playoff to decide
the winner of the amateur prize and
the title. According to custom; the
professionls split the prize money for
first and second place, regardless of
the outcome of the playoff.

Snow won the first hole of the play-
off with a par four when Mills missed
a putt, winning the match for himself
and Toomer,

Records Fall

Not only has the Wildcat track
team made an enviable record
for itself as a whole so far this
year, but several of the college
records have been broken.

Davidson’s stellar miler, Earle
Frazier, has lowered the mile
mark for the third time, bring-
ing it from the time of 4:38 to
4:30, Frazier seems to run a
better mile every time he com-
petes, if his times so far this
year mean anything. ‘Likewise,
John Lee, ace pole vaulter, seems
to be getting consistently better,
having twice raised the height of
the college pole vault record. His
latest mark is 11 feet, 10 inches,
four inches above the old mark.

These two second-year men in-
deed show unusual promise in
their particular events.

Davidson Golf Team

Loses Five Matches

Wildcats Trail in Inter-Scholastic
Tournament

The Davidson golf team, in its in-
vasion of the Duke, Carolina, and State
lairs last week-end, lost to all three
teams and came out on the tail end
of the State Interscholastic Tourna-
ment in Raleigh Saturday.

On last Wednesday, April 25, the
Carolina team shot consistent golf to
down the Davidsonians, 16-2, on the
Hope Valley course near Durham. On
the next day the Wildcats bowed to
the Duke Blue Devils on the same
course, 14-4, The N. C. State. inter-
scholastic champions overcame the Da-
vidson linkmen on Friday by ascore
of 16% to 1% over the Carolina Club

Jr., of State, had the best card, turn-
ing in a 74, two over par,

again defeated, taking fourth place.
Wake Forest withdrew from the team
competition at the end of the 18-hole
morning round,

N. C. State won the tourney with a
sum total of 632 strokes for the 36-
hole thatch play. The Carolina Tar
Heels ran a close second, however,
with 633; Duke came in third with
649, and Davidson took a 705 for fourth
place. High winds and fast greens
bothered the collegians' in both the
morning and afternoon matches. Fred
Newnham of State and Cliff Perry,
Duke ace, tied for individual honors
with 152’s for the 36 holes, Newnham
netting 77-75 and Perry 79-73 for the
totals,

Yar Heels at the Carolina course in
Charlotte Monday afternoon, the Wild-
cats again lost, 15-3. Sadler, Carolina
number two man, shot a record low
of 73 to win the individual scoring
honors, Captain Bill Bowman was the
only, Davidson man to win his match,
shooting an 80 to defeat Harris, Caro-
lina number one, by a 2 to 1 score,

Freshman Tennis Team

three defeats in as many: starts dur-
ing the past week, losing to Darling-
ton. School, Furman Freshmen, and the
first-year men from Erskine,

go down before the Darlington School
netmen, who were led by America’s
tourth ranking junior, Ramsay Potts.
The score of this match was 4-3, the
prep school boys winning after the
number one doubles teams engaged
in an extra match to break the 3-3 tie,

Later in the week the Furman and
Erskine--frosh netmen downed the
Centennials 4-3 and 5-2, respectively,

cently hoaxed the whole university
with his fake performances of mes-
merism and hypnosis.

HALVERSTADT LOSES

Duke Match is Repetition of the
State Tournament

Davidson's varsity tennis team suf-
fered two defeats in two feature
matches here last week. Thursday
afternoon, Barney Welch, Duke’s ace
player, led his team to a well-earned
7-2 victory over the Wildcats. Welch,
who recently was defeated by Jimmy
Halverstadt in the finals of the state
tournament, came back strong in his
match with Halverstadt Thursday and

turned back the Davidson star in
straight sets.
Another tournament finals match

was re-enacted on the Davidson courts
when Welch and Higgins paired to de-
feat Halverstadt and Lafferty, the
Wildcat number one doubles team,
thus repeating their victory in the tour-
nament two weeks ago. Lafferty in
the singles matches and Thompson and
in the doubles accounted for
Davidson’s two points.

Lewis

The matches were hard fought
throughout and the outcome was un-
certain to the end. Five of. the nine
matches went to the limit of three sets.

verstadt, 6=1, 6-1. Higgins (Duke) de-

Davidson took its second reverse last
week at the hands of the North Caro-
lina tennis team by a Score of 6 ta 3.
The match was played here on Sat-
urday and it was witnessed by a large
crowd of spectators. This was the
second time this season that Davidson
has gone down before the strong Tar
Heel team and the third defeat which
they have met on the courts this year.
They had high hopes of reversing
North Carolina in this return match.
All the individual matches were closely
contested and the Wildcats fought to
the last.

Captain Jimmy Halverstadt was eas-
ily the victor over Rickey Willis, Car-
olina ace, in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, in

P. C. DEFEATS FROSH

Evans and. McPhail Tie for High
Score Honors

Davidson's track team crushed Wof-
ford College, 107 to 19, on Richardson
Field last Saturday afternoon. The
Wildcats took twelve first places out
of fourteen events and tied for an-
other in the high jump. In four events
the Davidson tracksters made a clean
sweep while itf seven others they took
the first two places. It was in the
hundred-yard dash, mile run, two-mile
run, and shot put that the Terriers
failed to score.

The freshman cindermen lost to the
first-year men of the Presbyterian
College of South Carolina 61 2-3 to
55 1-3 on the same afternoon,

Earle Frazier, Davidson’s crack dis-
tance runner, again broke his own Da-
vidson record in the mile. He ran the
event in four minutes, 30.1 seconds,
which was 6.7 seconds better than his
previous record. John Lee also raised
his own record in the pole vault from
11 feet, 8 and 3-4 inches to 11 feet, 10
inches,

The Wildcats were without the serv-
ices of Captain Miller Cochran, who
was competing in the Penn relays.
Cochran showed up well in this meet
by taking a third place in the discus
throw.

Honors in the meet were fairly
evenly divided among the Davidson
team. High point men were Ras Evans
and Fred McPhail, who took two firsts
each to tie with ten points. Anderson
and Ward were outstanding among
the Terriers.

Jacobs, Presbyterian freshman, led
his team with 18 points by taking first
places in the shot, pole vault and high
jump and second in the low hurdles.
Dickson of Davidson took first in the
hundred-yard dash and in the high
hurdles, and a second in the high
jump, to lead the Wildkittens with 11
points. Presbyterian freshmen won
nine of the thirteen events.
