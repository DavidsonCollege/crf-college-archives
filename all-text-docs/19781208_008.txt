Charlotte cartoonist labels Davidson corrupt ©

“I did a cartoon on PTL one
time. Boy, did I get a lot of
nasty mail from those Christ-
ians! One lady put me on her
prayer list, which I couldn’t
distinguish from her shit list.”

Doug Marlette’s cartoon on
the Charlotte-based PTL Club
is only one of many such
drawings he discussed at the
Minorities luncheon Wednes-
day.

Marlette, political cartoonist
for the Charlotte Observer, has
been drawing since he left the
cradle. He has always had quite
an imagination, and in child-
hood he had an imaginary
‘friend’ that disturbed his
parents.

Concerned, his parents took
him to a child psychiatrist. The
doctor, noted Marlette, said
such a condition was ‘normal
for an eighteen year old.’’
Actually he was only five.

His parents played along
with the notion of an imaginary
friend. ‘‘Not only would they
set a place for him at the table,
but they gave him more dessert
than me,’’ commented Mar-
lette. “They even ‘let him stay
up later at night. So, I had him
run over by an imaginary
truck.”

In elementary school he de-
lighted friends with drawings of
Mickey Mouse and Popeye. ‘I
was slow in many ways,” he
said amidst laughter, ‘‘but I
saw this was going to be
lucrative.’’ In high school,
counsellors discouraged his de-
sire for an art career.
listened to them.”

Entering Florida State Uni-
versity with an art major, he
later switched to philosophy.

“I never.

His training eventually led him
to the Observer, where he began
working as the paper’s first
political cartoonist.
| Marlette’s cartoons have co-
vered a wide range of subjects.
Ones he displayed in his 900
Room talk depicted Hitler on
the psychiatrist's chair on the
eve of the Nazi march through
the Skokie, Illinois, Jewish
neighborhood. ‘“‘I want to
march on Skokie,’’ read the
caption, ‘‘but I don’t believe i in
freedom of speech.”
Another caricature showed

-President Carter driving a sta-

tion wagon loaded with camp-
ing gear. On the back seat,
dressed in toddler's clothes,
Menachem Begin and Anwar
Sadat were tussling with one
another. ‘If you two don’t
knock it off,” said a beleagured
Carter, ‘‘we won’ even go to
Camp David.

The cartoonist described a
typical work day to the packed
audience. He goes to work at

9:30, and after a conference -

with the editors, he tries to
come up with an idea for the
daily cartoon before 11:30. If
the-idea is approved, he goes to
lunch, only to return and spend
the entire afternoon-on a single
drawing before the 6:00 dead-
line.

During a question and answer
period, one student asked Mar-
lette if he ever receives any
negative feedback from the
politicians he depicts. ‘So long
as you spell their names righi, it
doesn't matter what you say
about them,” he replied. Jesse
Helms even asks for each
original drawing that pictures
him:

Duke Power is the party that

Pickens
performs
jazz

By JEAN SORACCO
Staff Writer

Among’the many talented
students at Davidson, sopho-
more Harry Pickens stands out
as a gifted jazz pianist.

Pickens began playing the
piano at age six and took
lessons for two years. He stop-
ped at that time and did not
resume his lessons until ninth
grade in high school.”

“I don’t know why I started.

My mother played, and she may. _.

have given me my first lesson.”
Harry is presently taking les-
sons from Mr. Swisher.

As a music major, Harry
enjoys playing and listening to
all types of music. “I consider
myself a pianist with jazz my
main interest,
miles ahead of everything else.”’

There is no particular mode of
jazz that he prefers. “I don’t
believe that jazz can be broken
into special categories.”’

According to Harry, jazz is
undergoing a revival and be-
coming more accepted as an art
form instead of a purely enter-
tainment form because musi-
cians today have more formal
training.

“Music is my hobby. I find
enough in music something that

"——|—would be analogous to other_ .

varied interests.” -

In the future Harry hopes to
perform and possibly teach on
the college level. “T enjoy
performing for an appreciative
audience. A bad audience can
affect the performance as much
as anything else.”

Music is a form of nonverbal
communication. If there isn’t a
rapport between the musician
and the audience, the essence of
the music is lost.

reflect the Observer's editorial

policy. Nonetheless, his own
biases are included in his work.
“All institutions are corrupt in
that they are self-serving,. from
Davidson College to the Boy
Scouts to the Ku Klux Klan. If
I do cartoons to undermine their

self-interest, they get restless.”

He is not under pressure from
his superiors to produce car-
toons that are against his
nature. ‘I have more freedom at
the Charlotte Observer than
most cartoonists in the coun-
try,” he noted.
