FALL SPORTS WRAP-UP

|

COACH BILL DOLE, trying to put a 1-8 season be-|
hind him, journeyed north this week in search of new
talent for next year. Before he left, Dole looked back,

on our poorest season since '53 and explained why it
all happened that way.

The main problem was, of course, an acute lack
of depth. “We had six freshmen this year who could |
have lettered playing varsity ball,” he said. “(Alec) |
Gibbs, (Bob) Cordie, (Carl) Hunt, (Dick) Voorhees, |
(Eddie) Crutchfield, and (Joe) Ansley would have
helped us an awful lot.”

DOLE’S BIG WORRY NOW is how to get six more’
scholarships. The Southern Conference freshmen eligi- |
bility: ruling dealt Davidson football a telling blow. Al-
though nine valuable seniors will graduate, Dole fore-'
sees a little more depth next fall, although the crisis”
is far from past. In fact, if more scholarship aid isn’t)
found somewhere, the crisis may become a permanent |
one.

Injuries hurt something terrible. If Benson hadn‘t
gotten hurt, if Warden’s ankle . ... in fact, the whole
season was a series of “ifs”, according to Dole. If Da-
vidson could have played like they played against
Catawba every Saturday afternoon they would have
been a winning team . . . “if that bad interference call
hadn‘t been made against us in the Citadel game, we'd
have been off to the races .. . if we could have got-
ten some breaks against Wofford . . .”

WHEN A TEAM begins to lose it makes mistakes.
And losses and mistakes begin to roll up like a big snow-
ball—and that’s what happened to Davidson this year.

Coach Dole said before the season started that we
would be lucky to win three games this fall.

And we weren't lucky.

A SOCCER TEAM that wasn’t supposed to go any-
where ran over everybody it played except two Atlantic
Coast Conference teams that were nationally ranked.
With a meager bench and a tough schedule, Paul Mar-
rotte’s crew called on a wealth of hustle and guts when |
the chips were down. They lost only to U.N.C. (twice)
and State, and considered the State loss an upset.

The soccer squad was certainly the most excit-
ing team in the fall sports trio. All-star goalie Claude
Finney was elected Captain of the 1960 squad, which
departing Captain Ward McKeithen says should be

Davidson's powerful swimming team kicked off its
1959-60 season in convincing fashion as the Catfish

events and placed second and third in diving.

Jerry Bussell was high man

King suffered a narrow loss
to Carson-Newman, 88-73, last

According to Davidson As-

“aggressive —— hustling all the
way. They don’t know when to
quit.”

Star player is 64 forward
Bob Hoyer. Other starters here
tomorrow will be center David

COACH HEATH WHITTLE’S harriers could have)
won a conference championship with a little luck, but
David Gilmour had a cold and Mack Brownlee was sick
and it was up to Bill Eckbert to carry the load in the
conference meet at Richmond. Eckbert amazed every-
body by finishing third and Davidson pulled up fourth.

Eckbert, who worked at it all summer, had cer-
tainly become the most improved athlete at David-
son. He and Gilmour made All-Conference and Coach
Whittle had one of his best teams here. With some
fine freshmen on hand, it shouvid be even better next
year.

A SPRING SPORT man, Coach Teddy Keesler, has |
done one of the finest coaching jobs of the fall. Keesler |
did what his predecessor, Dick McKee, was never able |

to do. He organized a smoothly running fall tennis |
practice which lasted until the middle of November. |

Fall practice culminated two weeks ago with a
match with an “all-star” team from the Charlotte Ten-

North Carolina, Keesler’s boys were edged 7-5.

The Catfish stretch deep in

free-style, and mainly because
of an outstanding second-year

Branch competed yesterday
in the 440-yd. medley relay,
the 50-yd. free-style, and the
