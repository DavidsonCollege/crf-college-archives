Davidson s Education
Program Receives
National Accreditation

Davidson has again proven
that its small size is no limit to its
educational capabilities. Itrecently
became the smallest of 500 col-
leges in the nation whose teacher
education programs have been cer-
tified by the National Council for
Accreditation of Teacher Educa-
tion (NCATE).

Meeting NCATE’s rigorous
952 standards and guidelines was
a daunting task for the Davidson
education staff, chaired by Associ-
ate Professor Grace Mitchell. But
it was a do-or-die situation.

Four years ago the North Caro-
lina state legislature passed a con-
troversial measure requiring all 46
in-state teacher education programs
to be nationally accredited by
NCATE as a prerequisite to main-
taining state accreditation. Only
North Carolina and Arkansas now
require NCATE accreditation,
though it is sought by programs in
other states for its prestige. None
of the other national liberal arts
colleges with which Davidson usu-
ally compares itselfhasa NCATE-
accredited education program.

The new state requirement,
which must be met by December
1992, was especially challenging
for Davidson. Davidson’s pro-
gram is the smallest in North Caro-

lina, and most NCATE guidelines
were written for larger universities ~

with entire colleges of education.
But three years of hard work.and
more than 800 pages of documen-
tation paid off in October when
Davidson’s program received
NCATE accreditation.

In April of last year, six repre-
sentatives from the state accredita-
tion board and five from NCATE
visited the campus: for four days,
conducting a thorough investiga-
tion. ‘They examined student
records, observed classes and stu-
dent teachers, and interviewed
more than 80 faculty members,
students and members of the pub-
lic school system. In the end,
Davidson was granted full accredi-
tation with no stipulations or pro-
visions from either the state or
NCATE.

One-third of schools attempt-
ing to gain NCATE accreditation
donot receive iton their first evalu-
ation.

In spite of the rigors of prepa-
ration for accreditation, Mitchell
feels that the process was a posi-
tive one. She said that it forced
Davidson to define its goals, make ~
important decisions and update its
curriculum.

Asaresult of the accreditation
process, Davidson has expanded
its education departmenttoinclude
2.5 full-time faculty members, 5
adjunct professors, and 2 part-time
faculty. Davidson has partnerships
with four area public schools, and
hasaccelerated its outreach to these
schools and others in response to
the demands of accreditation.
Some services include in-service
development workshops for teach-
ers provided by Davidson faculty,
as well as tutoring and outreach

programs in which Davidson stu-
dents participate.

The number of students en-
rolledin Davidson’s education pro-
gram has increased from 8 to 51 in
the last four years. State certifica-
tion allows them to teach in any
public school in the state and 28
other states nationwide. Many
more graduates teach in private
schools, where state certification
is often required.

Mitchell said the increase in
students has resulted from more
active recruitment by the depart-
ment and the relatively “painless”

requirements of the program. She

continued, ‘“‘Another thing is the
“Peace Corps’ mindset. Many stu-
dents feel like they want to give
something back to society, to do
something good for kids before
they go on to graduate school in
another field.”

Davidson offers secondary
education certification in Math, En-
glish, Social Studies, French, Span-
ish, and Latin. A major in educa-
tion is notoffered, so students work’
to meet certification requirements,
as well as the requirements of their
majors. The program requires four
prerequisite courses, two of which
are in the core curriculum. The
other requirements are all fulfilled
in the spring semester ofa student’ s
senior year. During that semester’
students teach and observe for 60
hours in an‘areapublic school and
take seminars to receive fourcourse
credits and earn their certification.

Davidson’s NCATE accredi-
tation is valid for the next five
years, after which the evaluation
process will be repeated. In re-
viewing Davidson’s fulfillment of
its goals, NCATE citcd as one of
Davidson’s strengths the quality
of support that the education de-
partment receives from the entire
campus, especially the adminis-
tration and the faculty.

According to Mitchell,
Davidson’s small size is actually
an asset in teacher preparation, and
makes its education department
better than those of many larger
schools, because students here re-
ceive closer supervision and sup-
port as they prepare to become
teachers. They are assigned to
work in mentor situations during

their semester of student teaching

with a “team” consisting of a
Davidson faculty memberand pub-
res school teachers and administra-

Construction on the new visual arts building is running close to schedule
and is not over budget, according to Bob Collins, Director of the Physical

be completed in July of 1993, and should be ready for classes next year.

Project Literacy

Adult Literacy is a tutoring
program targeted towards adults.
This program offers students an
opportunity to teach a different
age level if they can’t volunteer
for elementary or high school tu-
toring.

Atpresent, a few students meet
with their adults on an individual
basis. Besides private tutoring, a
couple of students also go to
Mooresville twice a week to tutor
conversational English to Hispanic
adults. This program is sponsored
by a church in Mooresville. So..

. if you are looking to improve
your English (you learn all this
interesting English and Spanish
vocabulary), give Emily Crowder
(-6052) or Sharon Cheah (-6626) a
call.
