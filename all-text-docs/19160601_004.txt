SPLENDID SERMONS

(Continued from page 1)

but we can put him in touch with One
who can, as did the little Hebrew slave
in Syria. Our lives will count for
something if we put them in the hands
of Jesus. They will count in a mani-
fold way and fruit will be multiplied.
When we see things in their true per-
spective they will be that which is great
and best.

Dr. Sentelle’s style was simple but
most earnest and impressive. A large
portion of the sermon consisted of Bib-
lical and philosophical studies made dur-
ing the four years in the class room.

THE Y. M. C. A. SERMON.

The Annual Sermon before the Y. M.
C. A. of Davidson College was deliv-
ered by Dr. A. D. McClure, of Wil-
mington, N. C., Sunday evening. The
text was: “I came not to send peace, but
a sword.” Dr. McClure began by
showing the seeming contradiction be-
tween this and the term “The Prince of
Peace.” Next he pointed out that, altho
Christ’s mission. was to free us from sin
and in this way give us peace from and
with God, the effect of His coming was
the sending of a sword into man’s own
family. Thus he pointed out clearly
that there was a perfect harmony be-
tween these two passages of scripture.
The coming of Christ necessarily broke
the kingdom of Satan asunder and Satan
tried to combat the progress of Christ
and of His Kingdom with the sword.
Satan and his myriads of devils were so
far successful in that they were able to
kill Jesus, but their success was only
temporary, as His resurrection broke
forever the power of death and of Satan.

Followers of Christ must not expect
that thev will have an easy road to
travel. They must realize that a servant
is not above his Lord, and as Christ was
persecuted they also will be persecuted.
Christ came bringing truth and it was
immediately attacked and un to the pres-
ent dav Christ and His Word of truth.
the Bible, have been continually assailed.

A form of error that is very common
is for Christians to use the sword to de-
fend the truth. This is never allowed in
God’s Word and the only weapon of
offense that a Christian should use is the
sword of the Spirit. which is the Word
of God. Dr. McClure closed by urging
all to become hetter acquainted with the
Bible so that they might have an offens-
ive weapon that was worthy and able to
conquer the hosts of sin.

ORATOR’S AND BIBLE
MEDAL AWARDED

The most tense moment of the exer-
cises on Wednesday was that just preced-
ing the announcement of the winners of
three medals—the Junior and Senior
Orator’s and the Banks’ Biblical medal.
The winner of the Junior Orator’s
medal was W. Y. Sayad, who spake on
the subject, “Islam and the Great War.”
The recipient of the Senior Orator’s
medal was W. G. Morrison, speaking
on the subject, ‘Defects in the Present
College Education.” The Banks’ Bib-
lical medal, the name of the winner of
which is not known to any one, until
commencement day, save Dr. Shearer,
was won by Harlee Morrison.

Wednesday, May 24, class officers for
