Question of
The Week

Davidson this year turns a- leaf

in her football annals with the in-
stallation and use of are lights for
night football. Since everyone has
had a chance to see one game here
under the lights, “What is your re-
action to night games at Davidson,
and would you like to see more or

less aud

to lighten its schedule, night games
will be necessary to guarantee a
good attendance. I like

see Davidson play most of their

would to

home games on Friday night so
they would not conflict with the
larger games in the state. This

would give many Davidson alum-
ni the opportunity to see Davidson

play several games during the sea-'

son, while otherwise they could on-
ly see the Homecoming game.

tion here at Davidson warrants
more night games. It is our only
financial solution. With the new}
ares recently installed, Richardson
Field is probably the best lighted
gridiron in the South. The large
amount of candlepower generated
allows the spectators to get the

most out of every play. Under these

conditions, I am in ‘favor of night

games here.
Charles Alcott, Junior:

football is fine, but when the real
autumn football weather comes nite

games seem to be lacking in some-|
thing. I would like to see David-

son play its first few games under
the lights, but after these early
games I'd prefer to see the games
played in the afternoon.

night games might make it impos-
sible to have a Converse or Salem
day, but this could be compensated
for by having a Converse or Salem-
Davidson Dance on an open date
week-end. Fewer boys will be able
to make it to Charlotte Saturday
night since the game will not be
over until about 16 o'clock. This
may be a major objection or a good
point depending on the individual.

to play night games in good weath-
