THE SPORTS PARADE

SPRING
FOOTBALL
CONTINUES ,

The old maestro sits down before his nine-
teenth century model typewriter, consider-
ably harassed by the president of Salem
College’s account of George Washington’s
impressions of the writer’s home town (note
the possessives) but partly molified by the
father of our country’s further impressions
of near-by cities. Should the great George
himself chance to dash by on the Prussian
white horse, he would doubtless hear this
columnist’s pleading call to “tarry a bit,
George, and give us your orieeriony of the
coaching situation.”

We wonder what old George would have
to say if he were interviewed at length con-
cerning the athletic phases of college life.
Perhaps it would run something like this:
Reporter :
seen the boys scrimmage, what sort of team
do you suppose we'll have next year? Wash-
ington: My son (father of the country, you
know), methinks you will have °a goodly
portion of success during the fiscal year. Or
would he rumble in an Al Smith cement
mixer voice: Say, kid, dats great.

So much for so much ‘space filling piffle.
These lame duck sessions for managing
editors are quite bothersome at times for all
concerned,

Unless additional games are booked during
this week, which the official bookers have a
distressing habit of doing at odd intervals,
the basketball season for 1932 will be offi-
cially concluded by Saturday, as also will the
wrestling schedule. Little success has been
achieved in either sport, though the Wildcat
basketeers did show some improvement
along toward the end of the season, being
beaten by Carolina, State and the College of
Charleston recently by margins of: two and
three points.

The Freshman basketball and wrestling
teams, however, came through in:a big way,
the quintet winning a big majority of its
games and the wrestlers taking every match
to date. To the Freshmen we can say—con-
gratulations, and to the varsity, we can only
say—tough luck. Better luck next year.

And with the close of basketball and
wrestling, some interesting developments in
Spring football should take place. Several
of the mainsprings in last year’s varsity have
been engaged in these two sports, and their
additions to the number of candidates now
engaged in spring practice should enable one
to accurately observe just what prospects
are for next year’s team.

Our observations so far have been limited
to the two Saturday scrimmages held in the
past two weeks. Last Saturday’s scrimmage
showed much improvement over the pre-
vious one and showed the gradual perfection

~of the Neyland system being used by Coaches

Newton and McEver. Both teams performed
erratically, at times executing the plays well
and at other times running them with con-
siderable mediocrity. One notices, however,
that when a play is executed with precision
and accuracy, each man doing his part as in-
tended, the results in yardage can be méas-
ured in figures of 20.

Dr. McConnell Speaks on
Washington’s Character

ean of Faculty Heard in Interesting
Address on America’s First
President

Unselfishness, patience, perseverance, poise,
and physical and moral courage were the ele-

ments of character that were brought out by

Dr. J. M. McConnell, in speaking on “The
Character of George Washington.”
The dean of the faculty prefaced his remarks

about Washington by defining character. He
maintained that the character of a man is not
only that which is carved into his life by expe-
rience and environment, but that it is also the
product of his nature.
