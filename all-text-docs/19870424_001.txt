Coack Greer plans to leave for job at Wake Forest

By KEN BOGERT & MATT
NEWSOM

This past week George Greer,
Davidson’s head baseball coach,
announced that he would be res-
igning in June. He has accepted an
offer from Wake Forest to become
the head coach of the Demon
Deacons in the ACC. In his six
years as the head coach of the
baseball team, Greer has brought
the club from a perpetual cellar
dweller to a powerful contender.
He has started a tradition of win-
ning that Kit Morris hopes to
maintain in the years to come.

Greer’s success at Davidson is
only one rung on a long ladder of
accomplishments. As a player,
George Greer excelled. He won
all-state honors at three positions
in Rhode Island. Playing for the
University of Connecticut, Greer
was named All-American twice.

He was an all-star at two positions
in the highly regarded Cape Cod
League and captained the U.S.
Pan-American team in 1967. In
the minors, Greer reached the tri-

‘ple-A level before becoming a

coach.

His accomplishments on the
field were not George Greer’s
only glory. Since his introduction
to baseball coaching, he has furth-
ered his reputation for winning.
As head coach of Davidson, the
University of Connecticut,

Avery Point, and the Cotuit -

Kettleers of the Cape Cod League,
he has more than four hundred -
fifty victories under his belt. His
lifetime winning percentage is im-
pressive — about .600.

Kit Morris had nothing but
good things to say about Coach
greer and his accomplishments
here at Davidson. “Before Greer

entered the program, the school
had only one winning season in
thirty years. Greer took a hopeless
situation and turned it around
completely.” Greer accomplished

this in only three years. His 1982 , -

team won two of fourteen confer-
ence games. In 1985 the team led
the league with an eleven and five
mark.

Morris noticed several qual-
ities that hélped Greer turn the
program around. Among his tal-
ents was an ability to “sell the
team.” Greer did this particularly
well in the areas of recruiting,
alumni support, and administra-
tion support. Greer recruited
many talented players without the
incentive of scholarships. Some
of his players could have received
scholarships to many schools, but

Students and faculty debate change to semesters

By SUSAN PEARSALL

An issue which is currently the
source of a great deal of con-.
troversy and speculation is the
proposed change from a trimester
to a semester system, which
would probably go into effect in
1988. What many students don’t
realize is that semesters are only a
very small part of a package pro-
posal which is the product of an
ongoing process of evaluation of
the curriculum and calendar that is
being undertaken by the Educa-
tional Policy Committee, chaired
by Vice President Robert C. Wil-
liams.

The proposal is, as stated in
the preface, an attempt to “pro-
vide a structure of excellence in
the curriculum and calendar that
increases the time available for the
kind of learning that is retained.”
The committee claims, “We be-
lieve that the present curriculum
and calendar, having served the
college reasonably well for two
decades, must now be signific-
antly changed if we are to have the
kind of learning environment we
profess in our many statements of
purpose.”

The question of semesters was
discussed heatedly and at length in’
a panel discussion in the 900
Room Wed:., April 22. The mem-

bers of the panel were Registrar
Sue Ross and Professors of Art
and Music Herb Jackson and
Frank Albinder. According to
Ross, because the Long-Range
Planning Committee decided to
recommend a curriculum reevalu-
ation, a change in the entire col-
lege environment is in the works,
and semesters are just one aspect
of the proposed change. The
E.P.C. endorses a fifteen-week
semester system and a core cur-
riculum to complement it “to pro-
vide greater coherence to the cur-
riculum for every student, greater
independence for juniors and
seniors, greater time for writing,
research, and thinking between
classes and over the course of a
term...”

Albinder and Ross, too, agree
that semesters are the best option
for Davidson; Jackson, however,
disagrees. He is of the opinion that
the Art Dept. does not have the fa-
cilities necessary to accomodate
the larger amounts of students
who will enroll in art classes each
semester as a result of the limited
choice of terms in which students
can take them to fulfill graduation
requirements. He supports, there-
fore, a modified trimester system
in which classes no longer meet
every day, but meet for longer
class periods in order to cover the

atures:

same amount of material.

His proposal sounds very ap-
petizing to many students who
like ten week classes, but it does
not provide for the large blocks of
free time during the day that the
E.P.C. desires. These spaces of
free time afe appealing because
they would be an incentive for
juniors and seniors to undertake
independent studies, for students
to participate in college-spon-
sored extracurricular activities,
and for everyone to have pressure-
free breathing space in which to
write better, more in-depth pa-
pers.

_ Albinder emphasizes that he
fast pace of a ten week term (“In
my 101 class, we do Bach in three
days”) leads to student burnout

. and faculty exhaustion, especially

in Spring Term, when so many of
his students take music Pass/Fail.
“The semester system would give
us 25% more course, but 50%
more time and fewer subscribed
hours,” he explains. Ross agrees:
“The existing system is like going
to summer school all the time.
With semesters, you’d have more
control over your week — when
you study, when you write your
papers.”

The students who attended the
discussion had many concerns
about the proposal. They were

ginning.

rather disgruntled when they
heard that the student body will
have almost no voice in the final
decision, since it will be voted on
by the faculty. Among their com-
ments, the issue of decreased flex-

-ibility was prevalent. Under the

present system, they claimed, it is
much easier to choose a major be-
cause one can take more classes a
year, can catch up on major re-
quirements relatively easily even
if one does not take any classes in
one’s major until late in the sopho-
more year, and can experiment
with classes one may not like
since they only last ten weeks.

Many voiced concern that a
change to eight classes a year
would mean a more limited educa-
tion (although Albinder men-
tioned that Princeton graduates
only take 28 classes). The most
disturbed, however, were pro-
spective pre-med majors, who
worried that they would not be
able to take the necessary pre-re-
quisites and would have difficulty
getting spaces in classes that they
have to have.

At any rate, the proposal
would mean sweeping changes for
everyone. The numbering system
for courses would probably be
changed now that juniors and
seniors would have greater incen-
tive to take upper level courses

(which would be designated as
“advanced,” or “specialized”
courses). Students who spend
time abroad would find it much
easier to return because, after a
semester overseas, they would not
have missed two.terms, or six
classes, at Davidson.

- StudentS-would take one class
in each of seven, not fou areas:
Literature, Art (including music,
theater and speech), History,
Religion/Philosophy (two
courses, at least one in religion),
Mathematics, Science (two
courses, one with lab), and Social
Science. We would take four
courses a semester with the op-
tions of over- and underloading.
The faculty plan to discuss (at
great length, of course) the entire.
newly-revised and updated propo-
sal on Monday. Following more
revisions, the faculty will vote on
these changes and probably
suggest more amendments. If the
plan then is passed, it will be
adopted in 1988.

While students are encour-
aged to get copies of the proposal |-,
from their advisers and to express
their views to the S.G.A., their
only input will be through Conrad
Doenges, S.G.A. president, who
will summarize these views to the
faculty before the vote.
