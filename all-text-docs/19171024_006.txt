Y. M. C. A. CAMPAIGN
OPENED MONDAY NIGHT

With a speaker of attractive personal-
ity and interesting delivery, the fall cam-
paign of the Y. M. C. A. opened last
Mondav night in a most promising man-
ner. The speaker is the Rev. Mr.
Wright, a Choctaw Indian, who for
many years has been a missionary in the
West. He is a dark, active man who
speaks in an earnest, Convincing manner.
His talks are interspersed with anecdotes
drawn from his experience on the plains
and are full of interest and especially
appropriate.

Mr. Wright is assisted in the meet-
ing by his singer, Mr. Young, whose
solos are a feature of the services.

The campaign commenced Monday
night, and will continue until Thursday.
Two services a day are held, one a
12:30 to take the nlace of chapel, and
the other at 8 at night.

Mich interest seems manifest in
the meetings, a large per cent of the
stedent body be'ne out to hear Mr
Wrieht's initial address Mondav night
In this address Mr. Wright took as hi
subject: “Examine Your Heart.” He
said that this was the wav to know
whether a person was saved, and that
once a-nerson felt the nower of Chris’
it would necessarily be shown in his life.
Christianity under a bushel is really no
Christianity after all. He urged his
hesrers to look into their hearts and see
whether they truly felt saved, and
whether thev truly showed to the world
their Christianity.

THE LIBERTY LOAN.

German propagandists. in America
have tried stenuously and with some
measure of success to imbue the public
with the idea that we are simply fin-
ishing the other fellow’s fight. Tha
America should have kept out of thi:
quarrel. And that we will pay out of
all proportion for our participation ir
the war.

None of these claims are true.

The State Department at Washington
has shown conclusively that, even when
she was protesting the warmest. friend
ship for the United States, Germany wa
plotting secretly to embroil us with
Mexico, to interrupt our friendly rela-
tions with Japan, to estrange us from
Latin-America, and generally to make i
so unpleasant for us at home that we
would not dare resent any outrage she
might attempt upon our national rights
and honor.

And the President has explained ver:
plainly, directly and convincingly why
he finally put aside all his immediat«
hopes of peace and went into the con

Ict.

The people of the allied Europear
nations this year will contribute $15,
000,000,000 to the support of the war
The American public is asked to provid
$20,000,000,000. On the face of it thi
appears to bear out the German claim

But this represents for America no*
only the expense of supvorting an arme
of 2,000,000 in the field but the initia’
expense of raising and equipping that
army.

Moreover, in America 101;000,00C
people have an annual income of $40.-
000 000,000. The annual income of th
406,000,000 people of the allied Eu
ropen nations is only $20,000,000,000

Where the per capita income, the in-
dividual income for every man, womar
and child in the United States, is $387

THE LIBERTY LOAN PRIMER.

Your Dollars Cannot Be Neutral.

You must be either for or against the
soldier boys now marching to the
trenches in France. You must be either
for or against your country. There is
no half-way station, no betwixt or be-
tween. ;

Your dollars cannot be neutral.

Uncle Sam needs your financial as-
sistance. American success in this wat
lepends upon our sending an army fully
aquipped, efficiently trained, amply sup-
alied with every requisite of the field.
Every link in the military chain must be
strong. We dare not take chances.

Germany's tremendous aggressivenes
‘n this conflict has been made possible
only by the highest efficiency in every
detail. The Germans were prepared a‘
every point when they loosed the dogs of
‘var and sent their armies hurling thru
Belgium on the way to the Paris.

Let's not send to, France the pride of
America’s young manhood—the hoys for
‘hom in any other emergency we would
nake any sacrifice, any whit less pre-
rared,

Take care of your loyalty to the army
and your lovalty to the country will take
-are of itself,

There are numerous wavs of serving
the Kaiser. And withholding your sup-
sort from the boys we have sent, and
will yet send to the front. the boys whom
the world at large is watching closelv
and expectantly, is by no means the least
of these.

You would bitterly and instantly re-
sent any other charge of disloyalty tc
vour country. Probably you haven't con-
-idered this phase of the situation, but
calmly think it over for a moment and
vou will get the noint.

You cannot afford, even unconscious
ly, to leave apen this wee loophole for
question.

Tt will be far cheaner and more self-
satisfying to buy a Liberty Bond.

SWEATERS TO BF SENT ;
TO DAVIDSON VOLUNTEERS

The ladies of the Presbyterian Church
met Monday afternoon for the purpost
of formulating a plan for remembering
the boys at the various branches of the
service with some kind of a present.
Mrs, Brady was elected chairman, and
it was decided to send each man a wool
en sweater as early as possible. A
many of the fellows are in camps with
out heating apparatus, these sweater
will no doubt serve on many a winter
day as fitting reminders that those a‘
home are ever interested in the comfor’
and welfare of those in the camps.

Nearer Christmas something else wil’
be sent to those from Davidson.

It might be well to note that the fol-
lowing men of the local Presbyteriar
church to whom these sweaters will be
sent, are all volunteers, none of them
waiting to be drafted: J. M. Rumple
1, E, Johrston, FE. R. Campbell, Harvey
Helper, Harry Johnston, Lewis John
ston, Herbert Thompson, Dougla:
Brown, Houston Brown, Conrad Shel-
ton, Lewis Potts. Everet Booe. Fred
Rooe, Thornwell Smith. Dr. J. W. Me-
Connell, Dr. Thomas W. Lingle. D. G
Worth, Palmer Henderson, Harrv
Caldwell, Robert Harding, Fred John-
ston, Robert D. Alexander.

This is how Davidson’s opponents

that in England, Russia, France and|came out this past week:

Ttalv comb‘ned averages less than $75.

The individual financial burden ir
Europe is about fovr times what it wil’
be in America. The hardship is im-
measurably greater.

Nor will all of this $20,000.000.00c
come from our annual income. Our sav-
ings account will supply most of it.
