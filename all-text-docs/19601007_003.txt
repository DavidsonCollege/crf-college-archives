Put Up Or Shut Up ;

The IFC’s revision ef the Sigma Nu
pledge program proposal is a definite
step in the right direction. We are a
trifle surprised that more. sweeping
changes weren't injected into the

stringent measure presented last
week as a replacement for Sopho-
more Rush.

At the same time, we can’t help
feeling a little. skeptical. Fraternities
have a penchant for setting up rules
and regulations and then seeing how
many loopholes in them they can find
to squirm through. The spirit of
Greek Week regulations, for instance,
has never been strictly observed, nor
has the IFC ever punished the viola-
tors.

We feel that the goals of Sopho-
more Rush could be reached through
conscientious adherence to this re-
vised program submitted by the IFC.
The statement itself is vague in places
and needs rewording—but the es-
sence of it would constitute a solid
pledge program that would not make

An Encouraging

Davidson’s department chairmen
revealed mixed opinions concerning
the adoption of comprehensives at
Davidson. It is encouraging that most
of the department heads favor some
type of comprehensive examinations
and have emphasized the importance
of well-conducted programs and out-
side examiners.

Despite the objections of some fac-
ulty members, we feel that compre-
hensives can be successfully conduct-
ed in the language. economics, Eng-
lish, psychology, philosophy, history,
biology. and physics departments.

A review of the material covered
in any of the above major subjects
will be most beneficial by helping a
student to consolidate his understand-
ing of his major.

a fraternity puppet of the freshman.
We urge the fraternities to accept it.

But it’s time to put up or shut up.
In the campaign to revoke the Sopho-
more Rush ruling, odds are against
the fraternities. A faculty that voted
rather decisively last May to over-
haul the Davidson fraternity system
isn’t going to backtrack just because
the fraternities make some pie-in-the-
sky promises to reform. It’s got to be
shown.

To make any impression at all, the
fraternity system must ratify the IFC
revision—or something very close to
it— unanimously. Moreover, we must
implement it immediately, with this
year’s pledge program and this year’s
pledges. We must abide by the spirit
of the proposal and forget about the
loopholes—for there are bound to be
loophdles in any statement.

To present any sort of proposal to
the faculty now would be foolish. But
in March, after having proved that we
can solve our own problems, the out-
look may be brighter.

Response

If the program is instituted at Dav-
idson we hope that the professors
who have voiced favor for this type
of program will encourage outside
examiners to be strict in their ques-
tioning of a student and in the grad-
ing of his performance. If we are to
achieve academic excellence in every
department at Davidson, professors
must demand a quality of student
work which will be creditable even
under the most stringent outside in-
spection.

The success of comprehensives
will depend upon how well the pro-
gram is conducted. A properly cqn-
ducted program must carefully test
a student’s mastery of his major.

To The Vagabonds: Bravo

Davidson’s newly organized drama
enthusiasts, The VagaSbnds, richly
deserve the praise they've been get-
ting.

The first Vagabond production,
The Madwoman of Chaillot, played
to a delighted first-night audience;
campus enthusiasm made another
performance necessary, and now the
Vagabonds are debating whether to
do it again.

100 % Quorum

The Student Council has tabled an
amendment to the constitution which
would establish a quorum of nine
men in order for the Honor Court to
begin trial proceedings.

Operating under a nine man quo-
rum, the Honor Court could dismiss
a defendant from school with only
four votes against him.

It works this way: Of the nine men
who constitute a quorum, three can-
riot vote. One ‘must serve as judge,
one must serve as counsel for the de-
fense, and one man must prosecute.
This leaves six members who are eli-
gible to vote on a case, and since a
two-thirds majority is required for a
decision, four men out of the nine
present could call for a conviction. In
other words, it would only take a third
of' the 12-man court to render a deci-
sion if only the nine members consti-
tuting a quorum were present.

We propose an alternative amend-
ment:

ee ce,

Meanwhile, rehearsals are in prog-
ress for MacLeish’s J.B. and for
Shaw’s St. Joan, which will star Mrs.
D. Grier Martin.

Such vigor is rare at Davidson.

We congratulate the Vagabonds—
and we urge students to get their
tickets early for coming perform-

ances..
—E. S. D.

1., Require all members of the
Honor Court to be present at any
trial, but allow a three-man leeway.
This would permit the court to con
vene without three members who
might be in the infirmary or away
from the campus. ,

2. Nine men must be present for
any trial proceedings to take place.

3. The judge of the Court should
decide whether or not a member has
a legitimate excuse to miss the trial.
We feel that only sickness or absence
from the campus at the time the Court
is called should be considered legiti-
mate excuses.

Under this amendment, every
member of the Court who is physical-
ly able to attend would have to be
present in order for a trial to be con-
ducted.

We feel that a student who accepts
the responsibility of membership on
the Honor Court obligates himself to
take part in all of its proceedings.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

‘Readers Rap Comprehensives, Anti-Semitism, Faculty

Dr. Thompson

Dear Editor:

In my opinion, the editorials
in THE DAVIDSONIAN in fa-
vor of comprehensive examin-
ations are much too optimistic.

|In the first place, there are no

panaceas for the academic
problems facing American col-
leges today; there are no “giant
steps” towards academic excel-
lence.

In the second place, any de-
vice which can so easily be-
come little more than e@
change in form will not ac-
complish much. Such merits
as comprehensives may have,
or may be imagined to have,
have been listed by their pro-
ponents. | shall not repeat
them.

The dangers are fully as im-
portant. The broader the field
to be examined, the thinner the
examination may become. Com-
prehensives may be suitable
for honors students, but in the
case of the average and sub-
average student they often
cease to be an examination of
the candidate and become a
test of the ability of the instruc-
tor to ask questions which will
preserve the appearance of re-
spectability without flunking
the student.

Again, proponents of compre-
hensives glibly pass over the
problem of preparing

course questions. In practice,
comprehensives often have a
strong tendency to become
little more than a twelve-hour
collection of the same sort of
course questions that we now
ask in separate three-hour ex-
aminations.

1 am willing to try com-
prehensives if for no better
reason than that the novelty
may have some small bene-
ficial effect for a while, but 1
do not look for any very sig-
nificant improvement in our
academic program or in stu-
dent performance as a re-
sult.

Only by changes in content
can we make real progress to-
wards academic excellence. But
no significant changes in con-
tent will come about until we
revise our standards of values.

When parents, when  Stu-
dents, and when the faculty all
really put academic excellence
as their foremost goal, then, I
think, we shall find that we can
make very considerable prog-
ress without much concern for
the forms of procedure.

ing around the campus, and in
the same way I know for sure
that under your accurate lead-
ership it is supposed to tell
the truth whenever and wher-
ever it goes.

Because of that I want to let
everybody know by your inter.

with the general behavior of
the crowd that attended both
performances of “The Diary of

Saturday.

Maybe I'd better not talk and

facts that happened during

who are not quite enough re-

(A Choice For Next Governor:

The Politician Or Naive Citizen

By TOMMY COLVIN
Davidsonian Associate Editor

Bob Gavin's appearance on
campus last week certainly
proved that he is not a politi-
cian. But it did show that he
exhibits unusual qualities for a
man running for a high public
office.
avin bared his sincere feel-
ing’ when questioned by a num-
ber| of students at the recep-

litically. I speak particularly of
his comments on the question
of school integration.

Gavin recognizes the legality
of the 1954 Supreme Court de-
cision and even feels that “the
next step is for the leaders to
sit down and work it out.” How-
ever, he is by no means a
staunch integrationist.

WANTS COMPROMISE

Instead, he approaches the
problem in a level-headed fash-
ion and calls for “compromise
on both sides.” He shows that
he assesseqg the problem prop-
erly by saying that “North Car-
olina is not ready for total in-
tegration.” He asserts that our
feelings must give way to the
law of the land jand that we
taust work to carry out the law.

Even more startling were his
remarks on the recent attempt
by several Indians to gain ad-
mittance to the bigh echool in
Dunn. He explicitly stated that
he thought the students should

have been admitted under the
circumstances. !

He said he thought it better
if the students remained at
their regular school. However,
because the classrooms prom-
ised the students were not pro-
vided, the students should have
been admitted to Dunn High
School.

Gavin added that he under-
stood the Indians applied for
admission mainly to bring at-
tention to the fact that the new
classrooms had not been built.

SANFORD RUFFLED

Gavin's remarks on integra-
tion bring to mind Terry San-
ford’s visit to campus last May.
Sanford also was confronted
with a host of questions about
integration.

As a Sanford advisor said
later, Sanford got a little heat-
ed up when the students kept
demanding an answer. He fin-
ally said he personally didn't
want Negroes going to school
with the whites.

Following the discussion, ap
editor of THE DAVIDSONIAN,.
who was writing a story for
the paper, was asked by San-

ford and one of his tep aides
not to print anything about the
discussion on integration. They
pointed out the political con-
sequences the article could pro-
duce, noting that Sanford might
lose the first primary as a
result. The writer abided by
Sanford's wishes.

Sanford's request for silence
on the integration discussion
was a smart and legitimate po-
litical move. And it brings into
sharp focus the qualities of the
two gubernatorial candidates:
Sanford, the shrewd politician,
and Gavin, the politically naive
but straight-forward citizen.

|
ADEPT OR NAIVE?

The question has been raised:
Do we want an experienced
politician or a citizen uniniti-
ated in the ways of politics as
governor of North Carolina?

Every week Gavin somehow
shows he is not really politi-
cally adept, and every week
Sanford shows his remarkable
political skill.

This fall the voters are faced
with this choice, and there is
a case for both sides.

which are related with man-
kind’s suffering and pain.

Dear Editor:

And so it happened during
the reign of Marcus Martinus,
in the Empire ruled by Alum-
nus Rex, that the great Council
sent out a decree to all the
land:

“Since marriage is not good
for some, no man shall be-
come betrothed until e year
after he attains citizenship.”

And a great murmur went up
from the people. What reason-
ing did the Council use to pass
such a ridiculous law? Only
15 per cent of the early mar-
riages were unsuccessful.

Had not the Council already
taken away every power and
privilege of the people? Didn't
they enforce enough outdated,
outmoded regulations? Weren't
the forced propaganda meet-
ings four times each week en-
ough?

The dissenting people as-
sembled before Marcus and the
Council pleading, “O Marcus,
why do you oppress us with
your whimsical meandering?
You own our bodies, must you
also own the souls?’

Marcus hesitated, and then
replied, “Nice people, | am

not a member of the Coun
cil, t am only their feader.
Therefore ! cannot answer
your problems, but I’m sure
that the Council might have
thought this out——wvh, may-
be they had some reason, [
mean, [ don’t know,—I,
duhi”

Then the people petitioned
the hierarchy, and the Council
replied in vague, inconsistent
utterances, as was their fash-
ion, “The Council has decided,
after great deliberation, that
this decree is in the best inter-
est of the State. 2 plus 2 equals
5, and marriage, with its love
and spirit of cooperation, will
interfere with a man’s first ob-
ligations, the State.”

So the people went away in
great anxiety. Several of the
weaker cowards came forward
saying, “Let us go fall before
the Council and grovel in the
dust and lick their sandals, and
cry for mercy. Maybe we can
appease their vanity and they
will reverse their decision.”

But the aroused people
stoned these clucking birds
and revolted against the
Council, killing each member
in his bed.

And thus it came to pass that
a new government was estab-
lished and the people prosper-
ed in happiness under the new-
ness of democracy.

DR. SAMUEL &. SPENCER, JR.

The

Editor's
Guest

Editor’s Note: Dr. Samuel R. Spencer, Jr., class of 1940, is
president of Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, Virginie. He
served as dean of students and history professor at Davidson

from 1954-57.

Is there such a thing as a right to go to college? Given
‘the assumptions of American society, I believe there is,
But the right belongs only to those young men and
women who are able and willing to participate construc-
tively in an experience which is essentially intellectual

and spiritual.

Quite naturally, in keeping with our development as
a practical people, we have looked at college-going
with a utilitarian eye. Too often we have measured the
value of a college diploma by its ability to double as a
ticket to a lucrative job or an invitation to the country

club.

Such an outlook has in turn led us to emphasize
the non-academic aspects of college life. We have ex-
tolled the virtues of those college activities, outside the
classroom, which promote proper adjustment, getting
along with peopie, “contacts,” the competitive spirit

and leadership training.

The current scientific race with its premium on
brainpower has suddenly called this emphasis into ques-
tion. Even stronger pressure for re-appraisal is coming
from the rapid increase in college-age pcpulation which
now allows most colleges to do what they wanted to do
all the time but could not afford to do—eliminate at the

door students who are either unable or unwilling to take
seriously the demands of academic work.

We are now realizing that while the whole complex
of student government, fraternities, clubs, athletics and
campus publications has definite value, the college ex-
perience must be first and foremost an intellectual one.
The money we spend on higher education is wasted if
colleges do not confront their students seriously in the

realm of mind and spirit.

We are also realizing two other things: that even
ideally college is not necessarily for every high school
graduate, and that a conventional four-year college
experience is not the only acceptable kind of education
beyond high school. Three year college programs, the
terminal junior college, three-two arrangements, the
technical institute—all are proving that old patterns
should not be considered sacrosanct.

The re-appraisal which our population growth is fore-

ing upon us will have very salutary

effects upon Ameri-

can education. It will improve the quality of our colleges,

many of which have had to

Struggle for academic re-

spectability. It will continue to stimulate experimenta-
tion in methods and curriculum. It will eliminate many
lowest-common-denominator practices in favor of educa-
tion according to individual abilities and needs.

Does the fact that many students may not be able to
get into college, as we know college today, mean that
American education is becoming undemocratic? I do not
think so. As long as every student of ability and motiva-
tion has the opportunity and even the right to go to col-
lege (the vast increase in financial aids will insure this),
it cannot be said that our system is undemocratic,

On the contrary, we will come closer to producing
