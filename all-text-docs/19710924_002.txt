Morris Abram critically analyses higher education.

Abram Criticizes Colleges
For Superficial Relevance

By TOM AINSWORTH
Staff Writer

Sharply criticizing American

higher education as _ suffering
from “sheepskin psychosis,”
Lawyer Morris B. Abram

charged that a man’s worth is
equated with a college degree
rather than with merit and
service.

Abram cited this as the prime
example why so many young
people in colleges today are
unhappy and have no real de-
sire to’ pursue a liberal arts
education.

“Thus our colleges are filled
with draftees, not escaping mili-
tary service, but dragooned by
the ceaseless pressures of a
society which . . degrades

many necessary and_ useful
services,” he said.
Another educational evil

which Abram noted was the
failure on the part of colleges
and universities to give the
student a thorough knowledge

Coalition Reveals Schedule
kor ’71 Moratorium Day.

By ALAN FORD
Staff Writer

Suspension of classes, gueril-
Ia theatre, vigils, and fasting
head a list of tentative plans
for Moratorium Day, according
to Ralph Peeples, spokesman
for the Davidson Peace Coali-
tion.

The national theme for Mor-
atolium Day 1971, is ‘local ac-
tion,’ Peeples said at the
group’s Monday night meeting,
consequently the Coalition's
plans will reflect the local em-
phasis.

Mark Meza, one of the or-
ganization’s founders, said that
the Davidson Coalition hopes to
provide handout sheets in the
near future which will outline
the various aspects of local ac-
tion covered by Moratorium
Day plans.

The group plans to ask for
suspension of classes on Mor-
atorium Day, Oct. 13, if their
calendar of events will occupy
the entire day.

Plans for guerilla theatre
productions are still emybryon-
ic, but they ers Saing planned
for outdoor prsevte.tation. Ten-
tative plans were also disclosed
for a continuation of guerilla
theatre presentations through-
out the vear.

Cecil Wilson, campus co-ordi-
nator for the Moratorium Day
aCtivities, is planning vigils
which will occupy an = import-
ant portion of the observances.
Two possible locations for the
vigils include Davidson and
Charlotte.

Meza announced that fasting
to end the war will again be
on an individual basis. He said

those who participate.

When asked about suspension
of classes on Moratorium Day,
Davidson College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr., said
that such a decision rests with
the faculty.

“I do not believe the college
institution should become pol-
iticized: consequently, I per-
sonally have reservations about
suspending classes,” he said.

Lake Swimming ‘Pr

By DAVID FOERSTER
Staff Writer

Shortly after the beginning of
the academic school year Coach
Charles W. Parker issued a
statement that the Athletic De-
partment had officially closed
the swimming facilities at the
lake campus.

The extent of the closing ad-
vised students and other mem-
bers of the community of the
dangers of swimming in Lake
Norman.

Since the issuance of Park-
er’s directive, the lifeguard,
which the Athletic Department
has provided to oversee swim-
ming activities, has been re-
moved, but measures to keep
students as well as other mem-
bers of the community out of
the water have not been taken.

According to Parker the ma-
jor reason for closing the swim-
ming facilities is principally
due to the deterioration of the
swimming dock which has been
in bad repair for roughly two
years.

It seems, Parker continued,
that the deterioration has caus-
ed the water to become . quite
muddy, thus making swimming
unsafe. Parker added that to
the best of his knowledge stu-
dents are still swimming in
Lake Norman.

Tom Scott, director of ath-
letics, said that Grover C.

of a particular discipline.

“The failure of such an ed-
ucation is recorded not only in
the boredom of students, the
restlessness of faculties, and
the intellectual vacuity of its
certified graduates; it is re-
flected as well in student de-
mands for Curricular relevan-
ce,” Abram said.

As an example of adminis-
trative fault) in this process,
Abram noted “instant” Black

Studies Programs which arose
in response to these demands
before there was even qual-
ified literature or teachers for
these courses.

The proper function of the
higher liberal education, in his
point of view, was to “teach
those students who have the
capacity and desire to learn
from books how to learn.”

In a press conference which
followed the convocation,
Abram said that the only an
swer he could see for the finan-
cial dilemma of higher educa-
tion was ‘“‘massive and_— un-
restricted federal assistance to
financially ailing colleges.”

Speaking on the friction be-
tween private and public ed
ucation Abram said, “‘the sur-
vival of private education is in
despensible to that of public
education.”

He noted that it was in the
private institutions where both
academic freedom and excel-
lence arose, two of the primary
bases on which public educa-
tion rests.

Concluding the press confer-
ence, Abram stressed that the
question was not that private
institutions “have to survive,
but at what quality and level

Meetze Jr., Director of Build-
ings and Grounds, was in the
midst of preparing a cost an-
alysis statement for the busi-
ness office concerning the re-
placement of the dock and other
related facilities that are in a
state of delapidation.

When questioned, Scott added
that such a report or initial
estimates were not yet avail-

ohibited

they must survive.”

In the convocation ceremony
itself, College President Samucl
R. Spencer, Jr. introduced this
year’s new faculty members to
the college, followed by the
presentations of the Alumni
Association Medal and Thomas
Jefferson Award.

The former award, presented
to the member of the freshman
class achieving the — highest
average in one of the degree
programs, was given by Danie]
S. LaFar, Jr. head of the Alum
ni Association to John M. Doug.
las, Jr.

John M. Bevan, Vice Presi.
dent for Academic Affairs,
next presented the Thomas Jef-
fersun Award to this year's
outstanding faculty member,
Earl R. MacCormac, associate
professor of philosophy.

After Abram’s address, Hon-
orary Doctor of Laws degrees
were conferred on both Abram
and Clanton Williams.

Scott said that he hoped that
the dock would be repaired in
the not too distant future, but
that an official date for the
initiating of repairs had not
yet been issued by the business
office.

Meetze was not available for
