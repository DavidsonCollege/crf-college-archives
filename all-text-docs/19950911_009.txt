THE DAVIDSONIAN’

OPINIONS |

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 11,1995 - 9

No, Davidson!!! _ That’s
Davidson College in North Caro-
lina! Sound familiar? Picture this:
you and your friends are over at
Billy-Joe’s house enjoying ahome-
cooked meal, when Billy-Joe’s dad
" Starts the usual so-where-are-you-
going-to-school routine.

Suddenly your head begins to
throb with the familiar dull ache of
upcoming embarrassment. You
cringe as you watch Billy-Joe’s
dad becoming increasingly im-
pressed by the prestigious, big-
name institutions that your friends
attend. Then the spotlight’s on
you, and you respond with .. .
Davidson College. Your heart
drops as Billy-Joe’s dad stares at
you blankly, and then smiles
brightly and says, “Oh! Dickinson,
Pennsylvania, right?”

Okay, so we admit that the
Billy-Joe episode is a little far-

No, Davidson!!

fetched, but as Davidson students
most of us have been there before.
The frustration of having to ex-
plain yourself to the blank stares of
people who have never heard the
name Davidson College (and there
are plenty of those!) is dishearten-
ing enough to make you wonder,
“Why am I doing this, again?”

_ When we leave, what guarantee do

we have that all our sweat and tears
will avail to anything? Not only do
we not have the advantage that all
this hard work should give us, but
we’re almost at a disadvantage
because the association between

excellence in academics and
Davidson is seldom made.

Ideally, we should be satisfied
knowing that we are recipients of
one of the best educations in the
country. Unfortunately, our soci-
ety places greater value on name-
branded schools, ignoring the fact
that quality and prestige don’t al-
ways go hand in hand. With this
mindset, to the layman, Davidson
automatically registers as’ a
schmuck-o school.

Sure, there are people who
know of Davidson, know how pain-
ful hell weeks can be, know that

the average student does at least 4
hours of homework a night, and
gets a 2.0 for the same classes that
Billy-Joe at John Doe State is mak-
inga4.0in. But what good does it
do if only two people in a crowd
actually know what Davidson is
all about? Your knowing that a
Davidson education ought to speak
for itself doesn’t give your resume
a louder voice. :
Eventually, at the breaking
point, when it’s down to Billy-Joe
and you, the bigger the school’s

name, the better your chances of -

getting the job/ the fellowship/ the

med school slot.

. Don’t look now, but you're
wondering: “Why am I doing this,
again?”

That’s what we’re wondering
too. You can certainly reassure
yourself by saying thatit’s all icing
on the cake, that when it really
counts all the work will pay off.
Butif the point of the game is to get
ahead of it, by paying the money to

‘go to a good school with a reputa-

tion of excellence, it is dishearten-
ing to discover that the advantage
you thought you had simply isn’t
there.

All this may sound like self-
pitying gibberish, but the fact re- °
mains that Billy-Joe’s dad is going
to remember that you went to
Dickinson. All you can do is shake
your head and mutter, “Davidson.
Davidson College in Davidson,
North Carolina.”

September morning
still can make —
me feel that way

Last week’s article was pretty
serious (and incoherent in places
thanks tocertain prankster editors).
So, this week I’m changing gears
and discussing a far more interest-
ing topic, my favorite Neil Dia-
mond songs.

As everyone knows, Neil can
croon like no other. Still, some
might wonder how this is relevant
to life at Davidson. Oh, silly fools
that doubt the power of Neil. He
soothes, he revives, he knows lost
love. In other words, as an over-
worked college student, I leave
him in my stereo at all times. For
those of you that are unfamiliar
with Mr. Diamond’s body of work
Ihave compiled my top four favor-
ite songs as a brief (but very in-
complete) introduction:

“America”: Quintessential
Neil. In concert, when Neil plays
this song, huge American flags
lower around the stage and Neil
emerges in appropriate red, white,
and blue rhinestone garb. Catchy
tune, uplifting lyrics, patriotic to
the hilt; it’s the American dream to
music. Who can doubt Neil when
he assures, “Freedom’s light’s

burning warm”? Perhaps I get so -

sentimental because this played my
mother’s aerobics routine when she
was pregnant with me. How happy
I was in the womb.

“T Am, I Said”: Affirmation of
the Self in the face of the Void: “I
am, I said to no one there, and no
one heard not even the chair.”
Okay, questionable lyrics, but at
least it rhymes, right? Anyway, as
usual, Neil’s message is blunt and
to the point: “I’m not a.man who
likes to swear, but I never cared for
the sound of being alone.” Neil the
existentialist.

“Forever in Blue Jeans”: Neil
shows he still identifies with
younger generations. This ditty
contrasts the materialistic adult
world against that of young lovers
without a care: “money talks, but it
don’t sing and dance, and it don’t

walk, and if you pardon me, I'd”

much rather be forever in blue

jeans.” So true, so true.

“You Don’t Bring Me Flow-
ers”: I getchills. Barbara Streisand
and Neil join forces in this duet,
easily my favorite piece of music
ever. These two masters of the
New York love song blend together
in perfect harmony. The song

hinges on the following exchange:

Neil bemoans, “When it’s good for
you, babe, and you’re feeling all
right,” and Barbara retorts, “well
you just roll over and turn out the
light.” The tragedy of modern ro-

mance. It brings a tear to my eye. _

The list of great Neil songs
doesn’tend at my four favorites. A
few of the best include “Sweet
Caroline,” “Cracklin’ Rosie,”
“Cherry Cherry,” “Kentucky
Woman,” and “Shiloh.” The list
goes on and on. Trust me, no
matter what the tune, Neil’s nos-
talgia and optimism can brighten
every “September Morn.” This
said, I leave you with perhaps the
Diamond One’s best advice: “Turn
out your heartlight, let it shine
wherever you go, just let it make a
happy glow for all the world to
see.”

Espousing the ruminations of the masses

Ihave a great feeling, an overt
whelming one in fact, that no mat-
ter how hard you try, no matter
what you do, you will not be doing
anything original. Someone has
done it before, played the rebel:
drunk every night, drunk every day,
desperately carried their hungover
butt to class, or, more likely, just
blownclass off. Their motivation?
The opposite sex. The reason?
What else is school about?

You could be the student.

Know all the teachers. Read all
you are supposed to read. Read
extra. Early to bed, early to rise,
some crap like that. Some crap
about responsibility and jobs and
families and preparation and col-
lege funds and nice jobs in nice
suits. —

Or you could run. Go abroad
for a semester. Go abroad for a
year. Find yourself in Jerusalem.
Lose yourself in Venice.

But what of running? What of

being the rebel? What of study-
ing? So what? Who are you im-
pressing besides yourself, your
friends, social critics? - Who are
you pissing off besides your fam-
ily, your friends, social critics? And
what are you doing original? Not
much of anything, I can assure
you.
Fairly cynical point of view,
wouldn’t you say? (Could there be
more questions in this rumination?
Isn’t that what ruminations are
about, questioning?). The truth is,
there is no originality left. Perhaps
the unique trick, the new bell or
whistle amounts to originality.
Waiting for. Godot was original,
but you are not Sam Beckett. Per-
haps among us now there is one
true genius, one person who will
change the entire world. ‘Most
likely there is not.

However, there are many
people who will change their world,
who will change it for the better or
for the worse. And how will they
do that? By. being. By being the
student or the rebel or the runner.
By being something, you can and
will change the world. Take ad-
vantage of that!

What am I saying? What can
I mean? Not much, really. Just
trying to prove you can get a
Davidsonian editor to read any-
thing.

anything. .
