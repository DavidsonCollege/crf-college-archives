a commoner that this will be a far
step toward compromising the po-
sition of the governing class in Eng-

land, which is the old aristocratic
families.
“Tt seems to me to be among its

many angles a contest between aris-
tocracy and the proletariat.’

Dr. Hood thought that the young
King was much more moral in his
deepest convictions than many an-
other of his predecessors because
instead of going ahead and
forming in appearance and marry-

Edward came out into the open and

be his ethical wife.

Teams Begin Practice
For Class Basketball

Heralded by one of Davidson's
traditional rains, class basketball
got off to a rather late start as the
prospective quints began practice
on the hardwood last Monday night.

A strong Centennial quintet, with

three years’ experience of playing
together behind them, will be
coached by Bankhead.

The juniors will be out fighting

for the championship, coached by
Willard Dixon. :

The sophomores, last year’s
champions, lost their star players

to the Kitten basketball squad, but
to keep the .crown again
under Cage Brewer's coaching.

sophomores. The frosh will suffer

as coach for the Kittens.
