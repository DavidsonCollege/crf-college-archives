and recently sent these reflections on
his “‘down under" stay to The
Davidsonian. —

We arrived in Australia at Mel-
bourne airport at approximately 3:00
a.m. on Saturday, February 26.
Today is April 7. Any remarks based
on only a month’s visit will inevitably
be superficial, but since Davidson's
term ends in May, I can’t wait any

Students earn
responsibility

The the Editor: —
The dust settles, the lights go up,
, the ordeal is over. The third in a series
of tests has been passed. The student
body has proven itself.

At the beginning of this term the
adininistration finally laid down the
law. It was decided that too much
senseless destruction and irrespon-

' sible behavior had taken place and
that something had to be done. First

- came the overreactions, cries to close
the Union, to forbid alcohol consump-
tion on campus, ete. Then, after the
first wave of hysteria had worn itself
out, more mature ideas developed.
“‘Let’s tell the students what we want
and see what they do,” became the
policy.

Mettings were held and handbills
were slid under doors. The student
body was made award of the adminis-
tration’s position and eft to do what
they would do. The next week Spring
Frolics was forced into the Union.
Precautions were taken, but with
hundreds of students in a medium of
many kegs, the agmosphere was one
ripe for misdeeds. The students,
however, failed to hang themselves on
the rope provided, thus passing the
first test.

Then came Greek Week with a day
at the lake, more kegs of beer, and
plenty of water to drown in. Again, no
mishaps, no destruction. We had
successfully completed the second
part of the Ordeal.

Now, this past weekend in Belk

..quad the final rite was held. A band,
more beer, and the most people yet, in
ana around four dorms..Once again
we passed with flying colors. The
Rites of Spring were-epncluded, and
the students stamped grade A ma-
ture.

What made the difference? Aware-
ness. The students were made aware
of the demands of responsibility on
them. They were made aware of: how
they were expected to act.

Before, the administration had
been lax in controlling the students,
counting on their personal sense of
responsiblity. The students had been
childishly pushing to see how far they
could go. Now, it seems, both are
aware of their limits and responsibili-

Davidson College

ee ‘first pala of Australia
was that it is. disappointly similar to
the United States. It bothers me.
Australian T.V. is almost totally
composed of American shows; big
hits like Six Million Dollar Man, The
Bionic Woman, and Happy Days

_ make it here also. The concert event

of the last month in Melbourne was
the visit of ABBA. In the high

schools the kids are raised on: —

American poplar music, American
T.V. and American movies, and next
to Americans, Australians seem to be
the most materialistic nation on the
face of the earth. They love their
creature comforts, and are working
hard to get larger refrigerators,
dishwashers, washing machines, dry-
ers, and stoves. In other words our
adjustment to life in suburban Mel-
bourne was very easy, because it was

not adjustment at all, compared to:

the adjustment that one would have
to make in almost any other country
in the world.

Prevalent freedom

The countryside is another story.
On our weekend trips out of Mel-
bourne we found a striking difference.
There are only 13 million people in
Australia and nearly half live in
Sydney and Melbourne, the two great
cities which compete with each other
for national prominence like Hertz
and Avis. Sydney is Number One,
but Melbourne tries harder. They are
building a new Arts Center in

Melbourne that will rival Sydney’s

famous Opera House.

Once you are out of these two cities,
you know you are in another world.
For long stretches there are literally
no towns, and even within two hours
drive of Melbourne there are marvel-
ous beaches and dunes almost desert-
ed except during very hot summer

. weather. When the surfers come to

surf, they park their cars on dirt roads

against the dunes; there are no |

restaurants, motels, or entertainment
palaces spoiling the view.

At Phillip Island, less than 100
miles from Melbourne, you can see
penguins come in from the sea and
walk up the beach, bringing food to
their young, who are waiting in
. burrows in the dunes. Koala bears
roam free in preserves and pose in
gum trees for tourists while quietly
eating eucalyptus leaves as camera
shutters click.

Open outback

There is a great feeling of freedom
here. You know that there is space
and that you can get away from your
neighbors. What threatens that space
is commercial development, and the
next fifty years will be crucial ones for
Australia. MacDonald's is here and so
ie Colonel Sander’s Kentucky Fried
Chicken, and so is Safeway and K-
Mart. Like the tentacles of an octopus
they reach out along the major
highways stretching east, north,
south and west. Which way will
Australia go: in the direction of

ecological protection or consumerism?

' The students are definitely

“side of ecology. wine ean ed

jixties seem to linger here in

esting sort of way. Students’
wear their hair long, and’ beards,
beads, and blue jeans are very
popular. They are looking for causes.
You can tell by reading the ‘graffiti on
the walls. ‘‘Lesbians are lovely,’’
“Law. oppresses women,” and “‘Sis-
terhood as powerful’ suggest the
presence of a strong feminist group on
campus. The main political thrust is
directed against the Governor Gener-
al’s reappointment of Malcolm Fraser
as Prime Minister in November of
1975, an act, which did a great deal to
stimulate nationalistic feelings in this
country.

But for the most part the universi-
ties are quiet now, because there are
no major causes; the main business.
seems to be study.

Commuter college

Monash University, where I am
teaching, was founded in 1961, and
now has a student population of over
13,000. It is very much a commuter
college. Cars pour into the huge
parking lots from 8:30 to 10:00 a.m.
each morning, and pour out again
between 4:30 and 6:00 p.m. Most
students live at home, as they’ do
throughout Australia. The major
universities are located in. the large
urban centers—Melbourne, Sydney,
Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth—and
there are few residential colleges.
They are simply too expensive. The
result of this is that a place like

‘Davidson is almost unheard of. I see

my students in class, and I find that
not only do I have almost no
knowledge of them as people but that
they don’t know each other. Monash
tries to compensate for this by having
small classes, and the heart of the
system is the tutorial. Nearly all
classes here combine lectures and
tutorials in a manner quite similar to
the Humanities program at David-
son. A student normally spends about
three hours a week on a course, and at
least one of those is a tutorial
involving not more than twelve
people. We would call it a discussion
group.

Teaching Aussie style

19th Century American Literature,

the course I am teaching this semes-
ter, requires one lecture and a ninety
minute tutorial for each student. I
carry three tutorial groups and the
other person teaching the course
carries two. Faculty members are
usually available in their offices to
talk to students during the day, but
the commuter system affects faculty
as well as students. Everyone goes
home at 5:30,_and* most faculty
members live some distance from the

campus, and there is very little going
on at night to draw them back.

‘What I like best about the system |
here is the range of ages and.
backgrounds in students. The more
‘‘mature’’ students, as they are
called, are mixed in with students of.
normal college age so that it is not
‘unusual in a class of: twelve to have
three or four who are in their late
twenties, thirties or forties, many of
them women who are back to
school to finish degrees that will
qualify them as teachers in the public
schools.

The mature shndenhe acuieiiante
enormously to the discussions and
reaffirm my conviction that part of
the problem with our: discussion
groups at home is that people haven’t
experienced enough yet to connect
emotionally and intellectually with
some of the literature.

Otherwise I can see very little
difference between the students here
and thé students in the U.S. I have
had threa weeks of teaching—Emer-
son, Hawthorne, and Melville—and
have found the responses pretty much
on the same level.

Perhaps the most striking differ-
ence between my life at Davidson and

_smy life here is that my life here is
_ department oriented rather than col-

lege oriented..I teach_on the seventh
floor of a huge twelve story building

with three wings. English occupies

the west wing of the seventh Poona

‘eighth floors. There are dhs vce
five full and part staff saminbers
_ of the English department; and we

teach together, eat lunch together at

the staff club, and drink tea together
in the afternoon. There ig a great
feeling of unity withinthe depart-
ment, and one hardly gets the feeling
that the rest of the university exists.
It is simply too big, and its concerns
are too separate from those of the

department. There is nothing particu-
larly Australian about this: it is

' simply a fact-about big university life.

Difficult studies

It is difficult to be an Australian
studying literature in 1977. There is
the traditional curriculum emphasiz-
ing the history of British literature

‘with particular stress on the older
periods, there is the possibility of
studying American literature both in
survey courses such as the one I teach
and in seminars with emphasis on
special authors, and there is the
relatively new and exciting field of
Australian and New Zealand litera-
ture which is becoming more and
more important here, the ‘‘keep-up”’
one has to read in all these traditions.

As one student said to me, ‘‘We
read your literature, why don’t you
read cee eas: answer her.
