“Little Tex” Shows Good
Aptitude for Cheering

Tex Tilson, of Davidson, may be plan-
ning for his three-year-old son to be a
football player, but he has shown indica-
tions of being a cheer leader. At the pep
meeting staged at Davidson College Thurs-
day night before. the team left for Durham,
Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of the col-
lege, was making a talk. He told a few
jokes. The students responded with laugh-
ter. P

When they subsided, and Dr. Lingle was
upon the verge of reopening his talk, “Little
Tex,” who was attending the meeting with
his father, cackled forth in the dead silence
of students awaiting Dr. Lingle’s resump-
tion of his talk. (More laughter by -stu-
dents.) Dr. Lingle told another joke. The
students laughed. Silence reigned. And then
“Little Tex” started off again. (And still
more laughter.) The three-year-old young-
ster, admired by all the Davidson students,
almost broke up the meeting.

An observation is advanced that “Little
Tex” is either thinking of the delayed buck
he will pull in the backfield several years
from now; or else he has a streak of English
blood in him. Which is true will be deter-
mined by time. é

LOOKING ’EM OVER

(Contin(ued from page 3)
ment, but we believe that the Wild-
cats will not have to take the short
end of the score again until the Caro-
lina affair, at least. We withhold pre-
diction until later for results after
that.

Our average as dopester received a se-
vere jolt last week, and Duke again con-
tributed its share towards doing it by mak-
ing Davidson take the score we had planned
for the Blue Devils to receive. Georgia
failed to halt Albie Booth completely, but
trounced Yale anyhow to furnish the other
upset. Our other four guesses turned out

satisfactorily. Our mark so far is ees

17 predictions.

Davidson meets Citadel this week-
end in what-the Cadets regard as a
grudge fight. Davidson looks like they
have a one to two touchdown ad-
vantage. 13 to 0 is our guess. Wake
Forest is due to beat State about
14 to 0, and may make it more this
afternoon. Georgia and Carolina
should pull off a free-scoring contest
where both teams are apt to run
rife. The score should be Georgia 21,
Carolina 13. Duke has the winning
idea, and may take the Navy. About
13 to 7, we say, in favor of the Blue
Devils.

PRACTICALLY ALL 1910 TEAM

(Continued from page 4)
the varsity squad being 143 pounds.

(10) A team that in eight contests were
on two occasions only matched against teams
of approximately” equal weight. V. P. I,
W. & L., Wake Forest’ and Carolina pos-
sessed much advantage in weight, and Car-
olina particularly, according to the records,
outweighed this midget.aggregation by ap-
proximately 40 pounds to the man.

(11) The team played its schedule of eight
games with a first string of fifteen players;
all visiting games with a squad of thirteen
players.

(12) The team was equipped with light
shoes, no stockings, pants and jerseys with
very little padding; however, no casualties
except minor ones. The team which started
the first game of the season started the final
game on Thanksgiving Day.

(13) The only two games lost were those
to V. P. I. and Washington and Lee. Both
of these opponents had marvelous place-
kickers in Hodgson of V. P. I. and Miller
of W. & L. Both of these players were posi-

tively deadly within their opponents’ 40- |!
yard line. The- kicking from ‘placement of |)

these two players defeated Davidson single-

handed. The W. & L. game was lost and
won in the last minute of play.

Bahia, Brazil, built in two sections, at the
foot and at the top of a tall cliff, has in-
stalled two American elevators for the 10,-
000 people who daily climb up and down the
cliff.

“Shall I Insure ?”’
That’s
been settled
long ago.
The quest-
tion now is:
“How much
insurance
do you
need?” The

answer is:

“Enough Fire Insurance to pro-
vide money to replace fully your
household goods and furniture.”
Not forgetting that since 1913 re-
placement costs have increased
101%.

Be sure you have enough. Let
us check up your policy. You in-
cur no obligatiun.
