Caviar, Chandeliers, And Couch

An old friendship brought Davidson College train-
er Tom Couch an unforgettable tour of Europe.

Couch’s former football coach at Western Caro-
lina, Jim Gudger, was selected to coach the U. S.
Olympic basketball training squad on. the three week
tour. Couch was asked to serve as the team’s trainer.

Couch thought his most serious injury would be
a broken neck by Gudger, “He put Lefty Driesell to
shame screaming and holloring. I asked if Lefty had

ever worked for him.”

The twelve-man squad took five days at Colorado
Springs to learn the offenses and then departed for
their first game at Turku, Finland. Included on the
squad was Dennis Wuycik of North Carolina and the
heralded Maryland recruit Tom McMillen.

Most of Couch’s unusual

experience occurred

while there. ‘A lot of tourists told us that in Moscow

the rooms were bugged and

our luggage.”

they would go through
\

When he got there his roommate had lost his
briefcase. ‘We figured that if our room was buggéd
that the microphone would be in the chandelier, so
everytime he walked by the chandelier he’d say,
‘Bring my briefcase back,’ Sure enough, three days

later they brought it back.”

Couch said he found the caviar good. “And every-
time you had to drink vodka straight. They were of-
fended if you didn’t. I did’nt know how long I would
hold out. It’s like eating ‘hot peppers. Then I learned
I could pour it in my water glass and get away with it.”

The food and drink soon get to the Davidson
trainer. The water in Russia wasn’t fit to drink. “I
was probably the sickest one in Moscow, I’d gone
so far without a drink of water I said I was going
to drink some water if it killed me—and it almost
did. I had the European trots for four days.”

This wasn‘t Couch’s only discomfort. “One of
our Bible professors was over in Europe last year
and he told me to take all summer clothes. It was

42 in Moscow.”

Couch said that it seemed the entire population
of Moscow (six million) was on the streets at the same
time. He believed the further he went away from
Moscow the people became friendlier and more pro-
gressive. He also mentioned that the Russian basket-
ball team was paid well, making 240 rubles per
month, when the average salary is 120 rubles.

“| think the Russians did do an excellent job.
They had read the Sports Illustrated article about
the track tedm and I think that is one reason they

went all out for us.”

Tom McMillen caught a lot-of Couch’s attention
as well. “McMillen was probably the one who talk-
ed to the interpreters the most. He’s a brilliant young
man. I expected the werst from him, but I probably
got to know him better than anyone else. He’s quite
a young man—I wish we could have got him at

Davidson.”

“McMillen tried to convert one of the Moscow
railroad conductorsiinto a capitalist. The guy was
a devout atheist and said he believed ‘in nature first
and Lenin second.” In London he said McMiilen sort
of served as a tour guide to the rest of the group.

The squad finished the tour with a 10-3 mark
and were only soundly beaten by the Russian na-
tionals. The team started strong by winning it’s first
seven games. It was a young U. S. group, too—the

oldest player was 22.
Ceuc

h felt thet the tour made him appreciate

the U.S. even more. “Our
themselves over there. I don

protesters ought to put

test a . I may get mad the next time I see a pro-

test.

ey never bothered me before.”

Despite the loss of several
key team members since the
completion of spring prac-
tice, Davidson football coach
Dave Fagg is optimistic in
his outlook for the coming
season.

Fagg indicated that
eral players who were count-
ed on as starters on’ this
fall's team will not see ac-
tion, Ricky Snipes, defensive
end, hurt his knee in spring
practice and is not expected
to play at all this fall,

Bill Reeves who also. man
ned a defensive end position
dropped out of school in the
spring. Offensive tackle Steve
Baldwin has elected not to
play this season and Gary
Cornette has transferred.

Spring practice also cost
the Wildcats the services of
Billy Colvin, who reinjured
his back. Fagg said, “Col
vin had a very good spring
practice and we really
thought he would help us
this fall”

Monday’s scrimmage with
Catawba also cost the Wild-
cats. starting middle _line-
backer Woody Montgomery.
Montgomery » sufferd a
broken arm,

Fagg said of the losses,
“When you lose the caliber
of seniors that we did
through graduation and then
so many men of this quality,
it makes it much tougher.
Since quite a few of them
are interior linemen that
makes us thin in the trenches
and means that several boys
have to learn two _ positions
in order to give us
depth.”

Junigpr Joe Poteat is ex
pected to replace Montgom-
ery. at middle linebacker
with’ sophomore Jimmy
Hardison also expected to see
action at the position

Despite the rash of miss
ing people, Fagg sees a lot to

some

be optimistic as the Wild
cats head into” the final
weeks before the season

opener witty Richmond.

“I think we have the op-
portunity to have an excel-
lent season, Mike Mikolayu-
nas has done a‘ great job
for us, It looks like the Mark
Thompson to Mikolayunas
and Rick Lyon combinaiton
will be a good one for us.”

Fagg indicated that in
Monday's scrimmage the
Wildcats had trouble on pass

protection for Thompson but
that “‘we've got it straighten
ed out in practice this week.”

Fagg is counting on Miko-
layunas, John, Ribet, Dave
Mockbee, and Bill Bracken
to supply the running game
to complement Thompson's
passing

Fagg and his assistant be-
lieve that the few  “wish-
bone” offense will be ready
for the Richmond opener.

“The players have done a
real nice job of picking it
up,” said Fagg. “It should
prove to be a really inter
esting attack to watch.

“We have some inex-
perienced players in the line-
up like Thompson and Mock-
bee, who has switched from
defense
there's

to offense, but
older players. We
are confident that Thompson
can be a very fine quarter-

bat.”

Despite the loss of Ed
Terry, who set several Da
vidson kicking records in his
three varsity seasons, Fagg
looks for the Wildcats to
have a strong kicking game
again this year.

“We have to get down the
timing on our kicking gamé,
but Harold Wilkerson looks
like he’s going to be an out-
Standing replacement’ for
Terry. In the Catawba scrim-
mage he kicked a 41 yard
field goal.”

Richmond's win over N.C,
State last week
firmed Fagg’s
Richmond's football squad,
“It's a tremendous football
team. It's not the most com
fortable “feeling to open
against one of the conferences
strongest teams but we will
be ready.”

Crawford Lost To Brevard;
Attempt For McMillen Fails

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Sports Writer

No, this isn’t a fish story,
but one of the prize catches
of last year’s basketball re-
cruiting efforts has slipped
away while another highly-

touted prospect never swal- °

lowed the bait.

Dave Crawford, the 6-10
bulwark from South Hill,
Virginia, who was counted on
to provide strength at the
: pivot position for the fresh-
man team, will not be at-
tending Davidson this year.

A conversation with Wild
cat basketball Coach Terry
Holland revealed that Craw-
ford. who had high college
board scores, was accepted
at Davidson with the condi-
tion that his high school _
grades would improve dur
ing his final semestef. Ac
cording to Holand, Craw-
ford ‘‘was requested to take
a course in summer school
here and make a C on iis
After Crawford received a
D in the course, the admis-
sions committee said he
could not attend Davidson.

When asked about Craw-
ford’s future plans, Holland
said that Dave is presently
attending Brevard Junior
College and he expressed
hope that Dave could come

ly switched and enrolled at
the University of Maryland,
much to the delight of for-
mér Davidson mentor
“Lefty’’ Driesell. Coach
Holland remarked that he
was ‘‘happy for Coach Drie-
sell,"’ and expressed regret
at the failure of his staff's
efforts to: land McMillen.
“Tom never wnisited the
campus, and we were un-
able to talk with him at his
home,’’ said Holland. He
added that Davidson's ef-
forts were hindered by the
lack of someone to operate
on the inside of the McMil-

len family struggle.
Davidson trainer Tom
Couch traveled with Tom
McMillen in Russia this
summer with an Olympic
preparatory team and ac-
cording to Holland they be-
came good friends. However,
Holland lamented the _ in-
ability to establish earlier
communication with McMil-
len as a reason for his ap-
parent lack of interest in Da-
vidson. It can also be sur-
mised that parental pressure
may have caused MoMillen
to turn a deaf ear to Coach
Holland's offerings.

Holland commented © that

However, freshman coach
Gene McEver is quick to
note that it will be hard to
better last year's 4-1 record.

Perhaps the best of the
freshman crop is Eddie
Petitt, a 64, 2%0-pounder

from Keyser, West Virginia.
He played quarterback for
Keyser High School and
could play the same position
for the Wildcats in the fu-
ture. However, he could wind
up at defensive end or line-
backer.

“Wherever ie plays he will
be a good football player for

Steve Keller, a 60, 185-
pounder from Columbus,
Ohio, where he was honor-

able mention all-conference.

Two running backs—John
Webel of Mansfield, Ohio,
and Mike Harding of Stem,
N. C.--are also considered
future varsity standouts.
Harding, a 63, 194-pounder,
is one of several Blacks who
will be on the freshman team
this fall.

Offensive line coach Turn-
ley Todd says that Steve
Shankweiler, a 6-3, 222-pound
tackle from Atlanta, and Tom
loanes, a 6-3, 210-pound of-

league is that Richmond is
the team to beat for the
Southern Conference cham-
pionship. The Citddel, East
Carolina, and Davidson ap
pear the likely candidates
to challenge the Spiders for
the title. Davidson and Rich-
mond tied for the crown last
year with 5-1 records.

Last season Richards fin
ished fifth nationally in total
offense by amassing 2,665
yards. He was ninth in the
country in passing, complet:
ed 49%, and threw for 21
touchdowns.

Richards’ favorite receiver,
Walker illette, has depart-
ed to the San Diego Chargers.
However, has has an excep-
tional replacement in Jim
Livesay. Livesay high jumps
6-6 and was 24th in the na-
tion in receiving.

Richmond lost 17 letter
men via graduation but three
All-Southern choices are
among Coach Frank Jones’
22 returning lettermen. Rich-
ards is joined by defensive
tackles John Barelli and
Bruce Kasarda.

Defensive backs Wayne
Tesh and Rey Easterling are
the enly other starters re-
turning frem a defenive i-ijt
which ranked 17th nationally.
Bill Fazleh and Harry Nor-

Richards in the backfield.

Richmond establish-
ed themselves as the class
of the conference Saturday
by whipping North Carolina
State, 21-6. Two other con-
fenders..weren’t as lucky.
Clemson downed The Citadel,
24-0, and Toledo crushed East
Carolina, 35-2. :

The Citadel will display to
the league a devastating run-
ning game. Tailback Bob
Duncan is regarded as one
of the best in the South. Billy
Watson has’ been elected to
operate the ‘Citadel’ Veer”
offense. He surpasses last
year’s quarterback Tony Pas-
Sander as a ruhner but his
passing ability is dubious.

Defensively, The Citadel is
weaker than the 1969 edition.
All-American John Small has
joined the Atlanta Falcons.
The line and _line-backing
corps are inexperienced. The
secondary should be \as good
or better than the past.

East Carolina has abandon-
ed the single wing: and now
runs with a Proset T. The
offense isn't the only new
thing as Mike McGee is the
new coach. With McGee
come six junior college stars.
One of these, John Gassazza
will start at quarterback.

place there is any depth on
the entire squad.

I's anybody's guess how
the rest of the league will
finish. Willlam ang Mary
finished with a 3-7 slate fast
year while Furman and VMI
together only won one game.

VMI did gain their first
win in two years Saturday
by dropping Furman, 13-0.
The Keydets have more ex-
Perience this year and have
some added speed in- the
backfield.

Veterans returned to all
Positions except the defen-
sive backfield. Again Fur-
man last week quarterbacks
Gary Shope and Murphy
Sprinkel ran the option well
with VMI amassing 287 yards
on the ground.

Willian and Mary has 24
lettermen returning and
should improve over their
3-7 record. Bob Herd, a two-
time All-Southern Conference
Pick at center, will be an
All-American candidate. Jeff
Doolittle, Bubba Meeteer
and Phil Mosser are expect-
ed to be impressive runners.
The defense is suspect as
West Virginia totaled 623
yards in their 43-7 victory
over the Indians Saturday.
