... the question is,

you?

ow, when it comes to a cigarette that
will suit you... you want to think whether.
it’s mild, you want to think about the taste

That Chesterfields are milder and taste better is no
accident...

The farmer who grows the tobacco, the ware-

houseman who sells it at auction to the highest
bidder, every man who knows about leaf tobacco
will tell you that it takes mild, ripe tobaccos to
make a good cigarette.

In making Chesterfields we use mild ripe home-
grown and Turkish tobaccos.
