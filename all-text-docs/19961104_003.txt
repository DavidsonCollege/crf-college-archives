Basketball schedule conflicts with Davidson policy

Players will miss too many classes for Southern Conference

By STEPHEN CEFALU
’ Staff Writer

Inan Educational Policy Meet-
ing on October 16, committee
members were officially informed
that the Davidson basketball team’s
Southern Conference schedule may
require team members to miss more
classes than current policy per-
mits. :

According to Vice President
of Academic Affairs, Dean Robert
Williams, an athletic team’s com-
petition schedule may not require
team members to miss more than
three Monday-Wednesday-Friday
classes, or two Tuesday-Thursday
classes per semester.

Along with Athletic Director

-Jim Murphy, Williams is currently
evaluating different means by
which to effectively resolve the

scheduling dilemma so as to en-
sure proper compliance with aca-
demic regulations.

Williams says the scheduling
conflict was originally brought to
his attention by head men’s bas-
ketball coach, Bob McKillop.
According to McKillop, the bas-
ketball program has little control
over the conference schedule game
dates dictated by the Southern
Conference athletic commission.

McKillop says, however, “It
is of paramount concern to our
program that the class time missed
by our players due to schedule
constraints is kept to an absolute
minimum.”

Williams says that one means
of accommodation may be to make
slight modifications to the team’s
travelling schedule.

McKillop says his chief con-

Four seniors chosen to
interview for Watson

By ALEX OBREGON
Staff Writer

Four Davidson seniors, Randy
Hartwell, Patrick Montoya, Sallie
Permar and Nathan Summerlin,
have been chosen bya selection
committee of various Davidson
faculty members to be nominated
for a Thomas J. Watson Fellow-
ship. Every year, the Thomas J.
Watson Foundation gives 60 grants
to students from 50 eligible insti-
tutions to go abroad for one year
and study in the field of their choice.

The four students nominated
were selected from a pool of 32
applicants. To be considered for a
Watson Fellowship, a senior must
submit a proposal in which he or
she describes a specific area of
study and places around the world
where he or she would go to pursue
those studies. In addition to their
proposals, the applicants must also
submit a personal statement ex-
plaining why they should be cho-
sen for a Watson Fellowship, and
what significance it would have in
their studies. Of the 32 seniors that
submitted proposals, 15 were cho-
sen to be interviewed by the selec-
tion committee, and from those 15,
the four nominees were chosen.
Patrick Montoya

Montoyahopes
to study the use
‘dof dance as a
tool to study
culture. He
would focus on
the eiania flamenco and its dif-
ferent forms, the tango in Argen-
tina, the Samba in Brazil, and how
each of these dances is a form of
expression and a social tool.
Randy Hartwell

Randy Hartwell, a French
major with an International Stud-
ies concentration, proposes, “Fu-

sion or Confusion?”, which would
deal with acur-
rent trend in
American
cooking. ‘“Fu-
Fe sion cooking”

‘71 brings cultures
together in the
same dish or
meal (thai pizza is an example),
but does not necessarily respect
the place those dishes or food have

in their specific culture. He pro-
poses to go to Mexico, Thailand,
Vietnam, and India, and study the
ties between cooking and culture.
Sallie Permar
Sallie Permar, a biology, ma-
jor, is inter-
ested in AIDS
"research. Her

_ | lines her inter-
jest in AIDS
education in
African Coun-
tries. s/Maving auent 5 weeks work-
ing in Zambia this summer, Sallie
encountered the devastation of the
disease and the lack of awareness.
With a Watson Fellowship she
would return to Africa to study the
approach to AIDS education more
in depth.
Nathan Summerlin
Nathan Summerlin, a majorin

poses to con-
tinue a project

year —a docu-
mentary about
women as prostitutes and exotic
dancers. He plans to go to
Amsterdam and Sweden and inter-
view various women in these fields.
The four nominees will be in-
terviewed by arepresentative from
the Watson Foundation early next
year.
Watson Fellows will be se-
lected and notified in early March.

cern is keeping faculty members
informed of his team’s travel com-
mitments. By doing so, he antici-
pates that any scheduling conflicts
which may exist will be made of
small consequence.

McKillop says “Professors
here are highly accessible outside
of the classroom and really willing
to extend themselves to help ac-
commodate student-athletes which
makes the whole problem much
less of a burden.”

Athletic director Jim Murphy
notes that the team members’ class
schedules must be analyzed on an
individual basis to determine how
much of an actual conflict the con-
ference schedule poses.

During former Davidson ath-
letic director Terry Holland’s ten-
ure, conference games were sched-
uled back-to-back on Saturdays and

Sundays with the purpose of elimi-
nating any weekday conflicts.
But McKillop says of the
former schedule arrangement: “It
was an intrusive situation. It took
the players’ weekends away and

Ce
Aaron Kadoch
left them extremely fatigued.”
For now, McKillop intends to
monitor the number of classes team
members are forced to miss and

consult with Williams in regard to
the tally.

Graduation location depends on funding

By KirsTEN RECKNAGEL

News Editor

Construction of Davidson’s
Baker-Watt Life Science complex
is not expected to interfere with the
traditional graduation location at
this spring’s ceremony, unless
Davidson can raise the remaining
three million dollars needed to fund
the project.

According to trustee policy,

. says Kevin McCarthy, Director of

Development, “All money must be
raised before you can start con-
struction and half must be cash
received.”

The construction of the
Watson Life Science Building, and
it’s attachment to Dana Science
Building to form the new Life Sci-
ence Complex is a 12 million dol-
lar project. Of’that money, “we

have nine million dollars raised in

cash or pledges,” says McCarthy.

Drs. Frances and Lenox Baker
Jr.’s $2.5 million donation, an-
nounced over fall break in mid
October, was a major boost to the
college’s fundraising efforts.

The school hopes to break
ground as early as possible, and
McCarthy says administrators ex-
pect it to take “anywhere from 15

to 18 months to build the build-
ing.”

However, “if all the funds are
not raised,” he says, “that slows
the project downin terms of ground
breaking.”

The location of this spring’s
graduation ceremony depends first
on how quickly the school can
raise the remaining three million
dollars in funding and then on the
subsequent scheduling decisions
of Davidson’s President and Vice
Presidents.

As of now, graduation loca-
tion is “still kind of up in the air,”
says McCarthy.

The Educational Policy Committee
invites upperclassmen to submit their
thoughts-_on the goals of
Davidson’s academic policy for the
next five years. Contact Chris Martin
-6236 if you are interested in
submitting a proposal.
