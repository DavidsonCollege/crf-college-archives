Lois Collier Probably Unable
to Atterid Dance

This Saturday will be a good time
in the ole town with the ASTRP
hoys for there is to be held for
them in the ballroom of the Concord
Hotel their first formal dance since
their stay in Davidson. Many of
their dates will be from Mooresville,
from the fair college of Queens
and other sections of North’ Caro-
lina. The boys guarantee the young
lassies to be of the fairest (seeing
is. believing!), and with the music
being supplied by the ASTRP’s own
swing band, the Jivesters, everyone
will naturally witness an exceeding-
ly swell time.

The boys and their dates will be
welcomed into the ballroom by
Major Marsh, Captain and Mrs.

Crocker, Lt. Ward, and Mrs. Henge-
veld, and the ranking cadet officer
Furman, who will be the receiving
line. After this so-called induction,
the fellows will swing out with all
they've got, and, incidently, what
haven't they got! In charge of re-
freshments will be Mrs. Gordon
Caldwell, assisted by the ever
charming Miss Helen Copeland.

Everyoné has undoubtedly been
very disappointed to hear that Miss
Lois Collier will probably be unable
to attend the dance. For the benefit
of you new students, Miss Collier
was chosen by the ASTRP this past
summer as their favorite pin-up
girl, and everyone was looking for-
ward with-.anxiety to seeing and
meeting her. However, according
to a wire received from her recent-
ly, she is busy making a picture in
Hollywood, and will be unable to
attend the dance.

All are looking forward to the
dance and we hope everyone has a
most enjoyable time. The dance
was arranged and planned by Lt.
Fruchter, atid we are sure it will be
a big success.

It was recently announced that
the ASTRP unit will leave Davidson
College and the boys. in this unit
will continue similar work at other
institutions.

The response to the request for

fair, but there is still a~ defi-

now has only five or six. This is an
opportunity for service that will be
greatly appreciated by the patients,
and will afford unlimited pleasure
to those who teach, so if you want
to do your part, see Marks Under-

Speech Has Been
Neglected Lately

Dr. Cunningham Proposes to
Have Professor of Speech

In- a recent interview for the
Davidsonian,—President J. R. Cun-
ningham emphasized the importance
of training in public speaking and
stated that in the future Davidson
would very probably take
along this line.

Dr. Cunningham is of the opinion
that the standard of public speak-
ing has been considerably lowered
at Davidson since the beginning of
the war. In pre-war days the stu-
dents themselves placed more em-
phasis on this phase of their de-

was above that of the war-time
student body.

“Most of Davidson's graduates
go into fields where the ability to
stand on one’s’ feet and speak
clearly and convincingly, is one of
the measures of largest success and
Dr. Cunningham = said

“For this reason, | am’ hoping that
