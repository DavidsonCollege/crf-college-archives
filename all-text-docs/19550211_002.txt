Constitution: No
Room For Gripes

As a member of the committee that
has drawn up the draft of the new student
government constitution, I would like to
state briefly a personal opinion as to the
attitude that I think the student body
should try to assume as it examines this
new constitution. In the first place, I think
that all of us have realized for some time
that some changes were needed in our old
constitution. Amendments were proposed,
and this patchwork didn’t prove satisfac-
tory to the student body. I believe that
everyone felt that a completely new con-
stitution was in order. The student council
felt that way also, and a committee was
appointed which got to work very soon on
this problem.

Basic things had to be decided in many
cases before we could have a basis for the
regulations that we kept from the old con-
stitution, modifying and interpreting them
in the light of new attitudes, ete. I par-
ticularly wanted to work on this commit-
tee because I had sat on cases all last year
and knew that changes had to be made in
certain of our rules. The attitude of the
committee is the attitude that I would
urge the student body to accept—one of
interested persons trying to improve con-
ditions about us through this one means
of improving the laws of the campus.

On the other hand, however, I think
that it is imperative that the students
realize their responsibility toward these
laws once they are passed. If the psychol-
ogists are right in telling us that rebellion
is a sign of immaturity, then surely the
Davidson Gentleman will not approve of
a basic plan and then, forgetting that ap-
proval, continue to grip about the “lousy
system around here” and even scoff at
the student council when they are faced
with enforcing these laws. Responsibility
is a sign of maturity, and here again is
the crux of the problem of student gov-
ernment here at Davidson.

The students are not by and large re-
sponsible enough to their own govern-
ment. Never do we hear of those who
make the loudest cries against our system
actually offering concrete solutions for
the problems at hand. If the feelings of
malcontent are so widespread, why in the
world don’t some of the completely dis-
satisfied gather up a reform movement—
a term which even they would scoff at. The
point I am getting at is that this commit-
tee of the Student Council has examined
the problems of student government here
at Davidson and present in this new con-
stitution basic ideas that we hold to be a
good frame work upon which we can build
a student government that can hold the
respect of both student and faculty. This
is by no means a perfect work, but I do
think that it provides a better framework
than we have had in the past, upon which
the student body—if it has enough in-
terest to do so—can work toward in-
fluencing decisions that vitally affect it,
instead of merely voicing opinions with
no organized way to present them to the
proper sources.

When we are considering this new
constitution we should also keep in mind
the coming elections this spring. If, as has
been charged, the student council is al-
ways composed of “popular” guys who are
not really representatives of the student
body, then the elections this year should
definitely be controlled by the student
body by an overwhelming vote in favor of
the real representatives of the student
body. If this does not happen, then let us
not hear any criticism from those who
maintain that real representatives are not

elected.

We are faced with the problem here
at Davidson of trying to grow up. To
answer this problem some completely
rebel and never have the genuine interest
to follow up that rebellion with some real
action that makes sense. Others complete-
ly accept the situation as it stands here
and never share in the experience that is
supposed to be engendered by education-
conflict with attempts toward resolution.
Still others have realized the needs of the
student here at Davidson and are using
the best means at their disposal to amell-
orate the existing conditions that do not
contribute to the aims of the college and
to the students’ needs for an educational
experience.

It is with the latter attitude that this
committee has met the students’ prob-
lems, and certainly anyone who has sat on
student trials realizes far better the extent
of these problems than someone on the
outside who is not faced with the decision
Of protecting the student body’s rights
and ruining a boy's life possibly, or letting
the boy go and see the rights of the stu-
dent body go by also. I hope that there
will be a great deal of interest in this
proposed new constitution, and that the
student body will take this matter serious-
ly, or if not, never mention any criticism
of the faculty and administration for
treating us like the children we will be
manifesting ourselves as.—Swain Loy.

Challenge To Students

Today is a great day for the Davidson
student. Throughout recent years, edi-
torials, bull sessions, home epistles, cam-
paign orations, and Monday morning com-
plaints have been filled with student dis-
gust at strict administrative regulations.
Now life is reasonably different. As a re-
suit of the new cut system, we are par-
tially freed from regulation and released
to individual responsibility.

Let’s look at the main feature of this
system. Now, anyone who goes beyond
probation, who overcuts a course by two,
forfeits quality points in that particular
course. In regard to other institutions, as
Dean Spencer has pointed out, few if any
major colleges and graduate schools re-
gard a student’s quality points as im-
portant. By Davidson standards, 122
quality points are required for gradua-
tion. Some have attained this mark by
the end of the first semester of their
sophomore year, and it is estimated by
the registrar’s office that the average
student obtains the requisite by the end
of first semester of the junior year. He
may overcut before this, but it is not ad-
visable. This means that any student hav-
ing over 122 quality points is able to cut
up to the 25% limit (11 class lectures on
the average) without penalty other than
loss of quality points. Of course, in many
subjects it is academic suicide to be “con-
spicuous by absence” very often. It is
entirely up to the student, however, to
make the decision in regard to cutting.
Student responsbility based on academic
achievement, then, is the core, the em-
phasis, of this new system.

The committee also recognized a basic
division between upper and lower classes
in regard to chapel and vespers. Juniors
and seniors receive equal cuts, as do
sophomores and freshmen. There is now
no such thing as an aggregate or fresh-
man cuts.

The liberality and philosophy of this
system is brought to sharper focus when
compared to the system recently estab-
lished at North Carolina University.
According to their plan, {f a student over-
cuts the limit of three per course, he auto-
matically fails that course. There is no
buffer zone or probation period, and
“minor emergencies” (not defined) are in-
cluded within the limit of three unexcused .
absences. Here the emphasis is on regi-
mented attendance, and many Carolinians
feel “very deeply cut” over the matter.

The new system here recognizes that
students vary in ability to learn best from
class and their own efforts: That instruc-
tors very as to stress on class lecture,
parallel, and teaching! That such ac-
cidents as oversleeping and missed rides
do occur. The student is now responsible
for his own actions.

Our absence system is on trial. A
professor may still take any measures he
feels necessary, if in his estimation a stu-
dent has been cutting more classes than
advisable or profitable for passing the
course. This program is subject to re-
versal by the faculty committee at any.
time they feel it is unsuccessful or abused.
Let us therefore make wise use of this
opportunity, and prove that the Davidson
student is mature, responsible and capa-
ble of determining his own educational

program.—R.H.M.

In New Constitution:

Shroud Of Secrecy Must Be
Lifted, Student Voice Increased

By the time you read this
aritele, the new Student Body
Constitution will have been un-
veiled. Unless I miss my guess,
there will be a considerable dis-
cussion of its merits and demerits.
If this period of discussion is to
be worth anything, we must all
have In mind certain standards for
judging this new document. The
question will be: “Can this new
constitution breaden the base of
perticipstion in student govern-
ment and is it designed in such
@ way es to breek down the isole-
tien thet hes characterized the
conduct of student government af-
fairs” If it is not so constructed,
the mere adoption of a new con-
stitution will have little effect
upon the chronically bad feeling
that exists between certain large
segments of the student body and
its elected representatives.

At this writing, I have not had
the privilege of studying the final
version of this new document and

have formed no

- 4 opinions con-
cerning its real

worth. But I,

. and you, recall
the numerous
occasions dur-
ing the past few
years when the

mm
wai tCi=iC CO campus was
Williameon Tocked by ru-
mor rather than

fact and when the Student Council
has been the object of criticism
and condemnation because of its
isolation from the majority of us,
the students who elected it. These
unfortunately numerous occasions
may well be considered typical of
the past history of Student Coun-
cil-student relationships. The con-
tinuation of this bad situation does
not make the future development
of student government seem like-
ly, and so long as the Student
Council, itself, does not enjoy the
esteem and confidence of the stu-
dent body, the future of the honor
system seems endangered.

AN INTERMINASLE DELAY

It was for the achievement of
these broad goals that ODK last
year made its proposel for the
separation of the judieial function
from the legislative and represen-
tative functions of the Student
Council. It was for these broad
goals that the “Crutchfield Amend-
ments” were proposed last spring
at a time when respect for the
student government was at a low
ebb. The present administration
opposed the adoption of these
amendments to the old constitu-
tion on the ground that they were
make-shift proposals, as indeed
they were, and promised to present
to the student body a new consti-

By MALCOLM WILLIAMSON

tution designed to eliminate the
basic causes for these frequent mis-
understandings and conflicts of in-
terest. After an interminable ten-
month delay, during which the
Student Council has again
floundered on the rocks of unde-
fined procedure and unspecified
authority, the proposed remedy is
being presented to the patients.

If this remedy is to cure the
disease, it must eliminate the
clandestine nature of Student
Council activities. The Student
Council is the representative
authority of the Students of David-
son College and not a ghostly in-
quisition that meets by midnight.
Onty if the new constitution re-
moves the velt of secrecy frem
the Council’s’-setivities will rumor
end insinuation cease to be the
chief means of communication on
the campus. The grapevine is a
venerable institution, but the mo-
‘rale of the student body will only
be improved when facts become

generally and immediately availa- .

ble. Thus the new constitution
must provide for open meetings of
the council with the possible ex-
ception of trial cases in which the

‘accused student requests secrecy,

or it will fail to eliminate the evil
conditions that prompted its draft-

ing.

GREATER STUDENT VOICE

A second provision that must
be found in the new constitution
is one for broadening the base of
student participation in our gov-
ernment. —

If the new constitution does not
consider this need, it does not have
much chance to broaden the base
of student support for the

- projects of the council. Perhaps

a clause making possible the
referendum both on the initiative
of the council and the student body
would be the best means of in-
creasing the direct participation
of the students at a relatively small
and compact school such as Da-
vidson.

I trust that the new constitution
will include provisions similar to
those outlined above and that this
article will be a congratulatory
message to those who have writ-
ten it. But if the new constitution
does not make any such provisions
for making the student council a
functioning representative of the
student body, we would be foolish
indeed to expect that its adoption
will remedy the unfortunate situa-
tions that are so often a part of the
Davidson scene.

MUST UCM GO?

By BILL SCHOLL

“What did you think of UCM?”

“I thought it was pretty good
on the whole—most of the speakers
really seemed to know what they
were talking
about and led
me to look at

: some things in
“ a different

™“ light. Take, for
example, the

scripture lesson

| , that was read
% one of the
itn? times about the
pompous fellow

Scholl who was pray-
ing. You know—the one who

thanked God that he wasn't like
other men but was upright and
okay, Le. really didn’t need a
Savior at all. That really meant a
lot to me. And you know, it made
me realize how fortunate I really
am to be past the level of that
first guy; I'm really glad that
doesn't apply to me. I might have
prayed like that at one time; but
now I am thankful that I don’t
pray as other men do, that I've
grown enough to rise a little
higher than al} those poor fools
who boast about their rectitude.”

Luke 18:14b: “For everyone that
exalteth himself shall be ebased;
and he thet humbleth himeelf

shall be exalted.”

“What did you think of UCM?”

“] didn’t like it so much; as it
went on, I got more and more
peeved. Here were some fellows—
mostly Yankees—who were trying
to tell us how to live. Now, if I
wanted my thoughts controlled and
wanted to be dictated to, I'd join
the Roman Catholic Church;
I'm a Protestant and proud of it,
and nobody’s going to tell me what
to do. Why, these guys even tried
to say what rules we should go by
in choosing the people we live
with. And the nerve of the guy
who said there were rules to gov-
ern ways we treated employees in
our businesses! Everybody that is
anybody realizes thet you've got
to go after what you want and use
everybody and everything for that.
This is a free world; I'm a free
American and Ill live my own
life. Religion is important but it
isn't everything; I'll go along with
helping pay for a church’s work
and going to services but the way
I run my life is my own business.
Ym willing to let religion take its
proper place but I'm tired of
everybody’s trying to make me a
fanatic.”
Nietzsche: “What ts Geed? te be
breve Is good ... All that heightens
in man the feeling ef power, the
desire for power, power itself.”

Student Council Exposition On

The following articles, writ-
ten by members of the com-
mittee on constitutional re-
vision, are an attempt to ex-
plain a few of the more im-
portent changes in the new
document.—Editor.

Student Attitude

By PERRIN ANDERSON

An important item which I feel
should be dealt with in the pre-
sentation of the constitution has
to do with an attitude of the stu-
dent body. I sincerely hope that
the members of the student body
will not approach this revised con-
stitution as something that the
student council and the faculty
combined are trying to put over
on them; but that they realize that
the revision of the constitution
was undertaken because the stu-
dents of Davidson College, from
whom any self-government stems,
felt that the existing constitution
was no longer adequate for the

ARNOLD

needs of the student body.

With the idea in mind that the
constitution under which we now
attend school no longer expressed
the desires of the students, the
revision was undertaken. We have
drawn up a revised version which
we believe and which we hope sets
up the kind of government desired
by the students. I invite each of
you to examine every article and
section with a critical eye and
with this in mind.

Trial Procedure

By JOHN CHILD

The apparent need for some
definite line of procedure to be
regularly followed in cases before
the Student Council has been wit-
nessed increasingly, both on the
part of the Student Body and the
Council. Four parties would seem
to benefit from such action: the
students, the defendants, the ac
cuser and/or the witnesses, and

the Council. This increased frame-
work is needed out of fairness to
each of these groups, but particu-
larly to the defendant; and to the
Council, to further ald them in s
more orderly and through investt-
gation of the case.

It was in the light of the fore-
going that Article XVII. Trial Pro-
cedure, was drawn up and given an
integral part in the proposed con-
stitution. °

The primary areas of the pro
posed article that no doubt raise
the most questions are two. First,
it was felt that the accused should
be presented with the charge, after
which he would plead guilty or
not guilty; then the progress of
any ensuing trial, it was felt, would
be greatly facilitated by the intro-
duction of a leader of prosecution
who would direct and coordinate
it.

A counsel fot the defense was
introduced, believing he could aid
the accused by famillarizing him-
self with the facts of the defense,

Dad On Davidson Maturity

Mr. Gragg and Mr. Leighton
McCutchan will alternate writ-
ing this column each week.—
Editor.

Charlotte, N. C.
February 11, 1085.
My dear son:

Let me say again that it was
wonderful having you home from
prep school for the recent holidays.
Now that you will soon graduate
it is my responsibility to advise you
about your prospective college
home. You know that I have always
wanted you to go to Davidson, my
alma mater, since you plan to be a
doctor and need a school with high
academic standards se well as one
which will help mature your faith.

COLD SABBATH

Several days ago after I had been
snowballed passing fraternity
court when bringing little Gordon
and your sisters home from Grand-
father Gray’s I decided to forgive
this immature outburst as an un-
fortunate overflow of exam ten
sions and drove up to Davidson
Sunday night to worship in the
lovely sanctuary. Imagine how
surprised and provoked I was to
discover no vespers because of
exams (how different in my day)
—not even a service for the towns-
people who probably were not
studying but thoroughly enjoying
the Sabbath-night holiday with
television.

There had been @ new snow
that afternoon, and it fay in-
nocently over the campus as If
te offer the students another
chance. It soon became UGLY,
however, as my seeking to worship
ended in another ferocious snow-
ball attack by around 150 well
dressed students in front of the
library; I wondered how they
would have felt had an ambulance
needed to get by that mammoth
snowball they made to block the
road. Rationalization may have ex-
cused the first outburst as youth-
ful energy, but I am afraid, my
son, that its repeated occurence
on a larger scale of mob violence
necessiteting @ cop shows a basic
emotional, intellectual, and yes,
even religious immaturity for ea
surprising number of Davidson
students.

A DAY ON CAMPUS

But these two instances and all
the broken windows resulting from
the snow merely illustrate one
symptom of the disesse of imma-
turity, as I found on a recent trip
to the campus during the day. In
chapel there was decided irrever-
ence during the hymn and dis-

courtesy to the speaker by some
students reading and talking: a
faculty member told me also about
the infamous baleony back rews
at vespers, and at one of the board.
ing houses I witnessed a riotous
blessing said! :

I enjoyed a basketball game but
was shocked by some of Davidson’s
sportsmanship and also the unex.
cusable noises during the national
anthem. After the game, I visited
the well-functioning College
Union, but here again I found
evidences of immaturity with the
juggled letters on the sign. (¢ was
@ memorable day at Davidson!

UNIVERSITY CHRISTIAN
MISSION

This week at Davidson, son, I
had the privilege of attending the
overwhelmingly successful UCM
(although the tiberals found its
theology too fundementel and the
fundamentalists its theology tee
liberal) and was tremendously im.
pressed by the work of the con-
scientious committees in planning
and the superior quality of the
leaders. I could not understand
why even more students did not
take advantage of the enlightening
seminars, lectures, and bull ses-
sions, and all should have had at
least one personal conference with
one of the splendid speakers. What
better opportunities could heve
been given for religious and in
tellectual and emotional growth?

It will be interesting to see how
many students really join Apos-
tolics Annonymous in relation to
their fraternities, personal ethics,
and by taking a part in promoting
a scholarship for a deserving
Negro. ( have heard that the
feculty hes offered the ‘students
2 reel opportunity to show thelr
maturity with the new cut system
emphasizing “student
bility” over “rigid paternalism.”

MANNERS AND MORALS

So there are definite glimmers
of maturity at Davidson in spite
of heavy evidence to the contrary,
my son. Nevertheless until they
beceme more pronounced | be-
Heve Carolina is the plece for
you — perhaps they sre net as
strong In their professions of faith
and devotion to duty es Davidson
students, but at least they heave
rectitude (don’t they?) and meet
important—good manners!

The family joins in sending

love, .
Devotedly,
Your Dad.
P. S. Perhaps in my next letter
I'll try to tell you what I mean by
maturity!

Revised Constitution

and making certain that these are
kept before the council at all times
during the trial. Neither the leader
of prosecution nor the defense
council would vote.

Secondly, it was felt that the
continued existence of student gov-
ernment necessitated the provisions
of Section 9, These provide that
all pertinent questions, with the
exception of  self-incriminating
ones, be answered in any case in-
volving an infraction of the Stu-
dent Body Regulations. Punish-
ment would be scaled by a slid.
ing rule based on the nature and
seriousness of the case that is
under consideration at the time.

Publications

By AUSTIN STRAND

Mr. Strand, although not a
member of the Student Coun-
cil, was a member at large on
the constitutional revision
committee.—Editor.

Article XII, Publications Board,

has been changed in several ways.
Probably the major change in this
article that will interest the stu-
dent body is the fact that there will
be no campaign speeches in the
election of the editors of any of
the three major publications.

The elimination of speeches in
the election of editors of the pub-
leations is due primarily to the
feeilng of the Publications Board
that editors are first writers and
men of the printing trade, not
orators. The feeling among the
members of the Publications Board
was that the proof of a man's
ability should not be in the num-
ber of laughs that they ean get
from the student body on any cer:
tain day, but rather in his writing
ability.

-The second reason for this
elimination of speeches was that
of shortening the time taken up
with elections in the spring. By
eliminating the speeches from the
Publication Board’s nominees, the
time for elections may be
shortened by a week or more.
