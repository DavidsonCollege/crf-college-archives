Professor Poland is the newest addition to the Religion

department.

Poland First Woman
In Religion Department

By Beth Mitchell

Not many people can claim to
be the first . . . that is, the first
woman in the religion department
at Davidson. Yet this semester,
Lynn Poland claims that honor.

Poland brings with her akeen
interest in literature, religion, and
gender studies.

Her educational merits in-
clude a B.A. from Bates College
in philosophy and religion, an
M.A. from the University of
Chicago in humanities, and a
Ph.D. in religion and literature,
also from the University of Chi-
cago.

She gained teaching experi-
ence at both the University of
Chicago and Bates.

When asked what attracted
her to Davidson, Poland had high
praise for Davidson, and espe-
cially for its religion department.

She is glad of the opportunity
she has to teach subjects that in-
terests her and bring her interests
to Davidson, previously lacking
studies on gender in religion.

Poland has definite ideas about
what education should be.

She sees that today students
everywhere are so focused on
“making the grade” for graduate
school that they are not excited
about just learning.

She hopes to create some ex-
citement amongst her students by
encouraging them to “actively pur-
sue their studies;” education is
about “questions, not answers.”

As a professor, Poland hopes
to be accessible to students and
demanding (“I have high stan-
dards!!’”).

At the moment, Poland con-
tinues to do research for a book
about biblical interpretation, par-
ticularly, ona literary approach to
the Bible. For a taste of what the
book will be about, look into her
class next semester on Biblical
interpretation.

Poland’s interests outside the
classroom include travelling,
dancing, and fixing up old houses.
Overall, her: impressions of her
first few weeks at Davidson are
very positive.

Have Fun Jumping Rope, Rollerblading

By Marlo Cobb
On the days when all “normal”
forms of exercise seem boring,

- spend your Designated Exercise

Time doing something different.
Instead-of running, try jumping
rope for 20 minutes.

Professional football player
Herschel Walker, tennis pros
Jimmy Connors and Mary Beth
Ruth, and the U.S. Marine Corps
all jump rope as part of their cross-
training.

When you jump rope, you land
on the balls of your feet, which
allows the calf to absorb some of
the impact of your jump before it
reaches the knees. Jumping rope,
therefore, is easier on the knees
than running.

Jumping rope also works the

shoulders and forearms, and im-
proves coordination.

When jumping, use aerobic or
cross-training shoes, and jump on
aflatsurface. Avoidconcrete, since
this surface doesn’t “give.” Alter-
nate jumping with nonjumping
steps, to keep your heart rate up.

Test the length of your rope. A
too-short rope isimpossible to jump
through, while a rope that’s too
long forces you to rotate your
shoulders instead of your wrists
and forearms.

To shake sure youreopé *sokay,
put a foot in the center and pull up
both ends. The handles should just
reach under your arms.

Realize that jumping rope is
classifiéd.as a skill, Similar to ten-
nis or skiing, so don’t give up if
you feel uncoordinated at first;
you’ ll get better with practice.

Skipping (in place of running)
is a potential form of exercise that

Marlo Cobb rollerblades by Cannon.

The idea for Rollerblades
began to develop around 1980
when “in-line skates,” skates with
four wheels in a line instead of the
traditional two pairs of wheels,
were used for skaters, hockey play-
ers, and nordic skiers during their
off-season training.

In 1984, an entrepreneur by
the name of Bob Naegele (who is
now extremely wealthy, nodoubt),
bought the rights to these skates,
re-naméd’ the’ company: “Roller-*
blades,” and marketed them to the
general population as an alterna-
tive form of recreational exercise.

It worked.

Today, Rollerblades have

the Powers That Be have tried to
make a fad, but it hasn’t really
worked (much like the return of
bell-bottoms in the fashion world).
The reason why is probably be-
cause it looks even stranger than
powerwalking.

However, I’HadmitI have tried
it and it’s a lot harder than what
you remember from kindergarten.
Skipping for 20 minutes straight
for aerobic benefit is not the same
as for two seconds of skipping to
reach the swingset.

People often ask me about
Rollerblades: Are they hard to skate
on? Is it like skiing? Is it really
good exercise? If I were debating
investing $250 in something, I
would ask about it, too.

Here is a little history, some
answers to those questions, and
some reasons why I bought mine.

become a fad item, and an accept-
able part of a cross-training regi-
ment for athletes other than skiers
and skaters.

As farasmaneuverablilty goes,
in my opinion this type of skate
does a lot better than the traditional
type.

Itis alittle harder to balance at
first, but once you become used to
the skates you feel like you’ ve got
much more control than on tradi-
tional skates. Rollerblading is
similar to ice skating, but ice skat-
ing is harder because ice is such a
slippery surface compared to con-
crete.

Wet écncrein, however, can
get pretty slippery, so I wouldn’t
advise skating in the rain.

Although hockey stops are out
of the question on Rollerblades,
you can still get the feeling of

skiing when you’re on an incline;
you make turns the same way, and
work the some of the same muscles
as when downhill skiing.
Balancing on Rollerblades
builds strong back and stomach
muscles, and skating is an excel-

lent form of low-impact aerobic
exercise, with minimal stress on
the knees and ankles compared to”
running.

Like I said; ‘Ahibte! skates run

mine, Iconsidered that I pay around
$80 for running shoes every six
months anyway.

The boot of a Rollerblade lasts
forever; the inner lining is wash-
able, and wheels are around $25 a
set. [bought my skatesin June, and
IT haven’t needed to replace the
wheels yet.

If you are going to buy some
type of in-line skate, settle for
nothing but the best.

was well worth the higher cost; I

quality, and the booti is much more.

The owner of a New York
skating-equipmentstore says, “In-
line skating will be to the 90s what
running was to the 80s.” I don’t
know about that. But they have
been a lot of fun. (If anyone wants
to give them a try, I wear a 6 1/2.)

Weird Fact of the Week: The
best vitamin C: sources are not
obvious. Raisins have 1.5 times
more vitamin C than. oranges.
Cauliflower has more vitamin C
than oranges, too. One cup of cau-
liflower contains more than the
U.S. RDA daily requirement.
