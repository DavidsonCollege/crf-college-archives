Science Facilities Seen As ‘Inadequate’

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Staff Writer

According to Professor of
Chemistry J. N. Burnett, there
is a definite need for a moder-
nization of facilities in the Mar-
tin Science Building.

He cited inadequate ven-
tilation, lack of proper air con-
ditioning, overloaded electrical!
wiring, faulty plumbing and
poorly organized floor space as
the primary problems.

Vice President: of Finance
and Development C. David Cor-
nell concurred. “It is obvious

we must do something to
upgrade our chemistry
facility,’ he said.

Burnett said that the hoods
for eliminating chemical fumes
were worn out in all of the labs.
He added that in fab 114, the
ventilating hood is about 30
vears old.

“In many cases the building

isn't) wired tor the modern
equipment we have.” com-
ment Burnett. For an exam-

ple. he said that the workshop
recently had to rewire the plugs
in the labs because much of
the modern equipment requires

three-pronged plugs.

This necessity and others
have essentially created two
systems of wiring for the
building which puts a heavy
load on the circuits.

The plumbing system is
faulty especially in the organic

labs. “The steam system is

many experiments, and since
the heating and steam systems
are intertwined, the heat must
be turned on to use the steam.

In addition, only the two ad-
vanced labs have hot water.

Poorly organized floor space
has been a_ troublesome
problem in the Martin Science
Building. according to Burnett

“We have been real lucky

that there have been no big fires
in the labs,” said Snyder
Another major complaint is
the building itself. Snyder ex-
plained that) Martin Science
Building was constructed to
-match the library, and that
there is a lot of wasted space.
One specific complaint is that
the steam can’t be turned on in
the morning, because the pipes
knock and disturb lectures.
Another problem is the lack of
a controlled temperature room.
Smith says this room is needed
to house instruments which
require a regulated humidity
and temperature to function
properly.
Other difficulties center

around the classrooms, one of
which echoes and makes lec-
turing difficult, and one which
has very bad lighting.

The repair facility tor the
chemistry equipment is located
in’ Charlotte and has createa
some problems. Snyder pointed
oul that a student musi wait io:

for a repairman, however, and
suggested that one person could
be hired to keep equipment in
all science areas running
correctly.

At the present time, there are
four Seniors and four Juniors
working on extended studies
projects in chemistry. Burnett
estimated that they use bet-
ween $50 and $100 of supplies
each.

students working on = such

Burnett offered two possible
solutions to the building dilem
ma. Either the old building
could be renovated or a new one
could be constructed. The latter
plan had been discussed last
vear with the administration
and within the department, but
‘was not thought feasible.

Renovation will cost between
$400.000 and $500,000. Burnett
emphasized thai these figures

and the entire idea of
remodeling are only his per-
sonal estimation oft — the
situation
