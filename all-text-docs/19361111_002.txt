Brighten The Campus...) _

We have already remarked clsewnhere on
the suecess of llomecoming decoratiors. And
while on the subiect of campus beantitul we
would like to add our endorsement to a sug-
gestion which comes to us irom Mrs. N. T.
Smith: supervisor of dormitories and “moth-
er” to an entire student body.

Why not add flowers to our already exten
sive planting’ Each vear the college spends
several thousand dollars on its tront campus
alone. Yet one thing is lacking color. Noth-
ing eoulc do more to complete the picture
“than a few beds and borders of bubs aiid
ilowering_ shrubs. Now is the time for the
spring planting.

Naturally the eyaical will say that flowers
have no place at a boys’ school, that our stu-
dents would not appreciate them. Yet we
kuow of a state university (nearly six times
the size of Davidson) whose campus is a riot
ot color throughout the spring and summer
months,

Then, too: we did have flowers here at one
ume. The ruined beds about the literary so-
ciety halls attest to that. We understand that
there were even window boxes in the dormi-
tories. Har be it irom us to suggest anything
so radical. Still why not more rambling roses

.and azelia? and why not the addition of tulips,
hyacinths, iris. iessamine and crepe myrtle?
They woald look mighty good.

What freedom of choice do we have? We
learn only to obey certain rigid ruies, not to
choose betweeri what is right and what is not.
Consider the ditierenee between the graduate:
who is no longer “required to go to church,”
and the graduate who goes to church because
he wants to.

Required church attendance may form the
habit of going to chureh temporarily, but it
alse jorms a stronger habit the habit of re-
garding church as a thing to be avoided.

This attituce we do not like. We wish to
escape it. Therefore we propose a change—
ireedom in church attendance for seniors at
least.

that cach one must take up his

not ‘necessary to do anyway.”*

Christianity is only what we make

The Davidson High school foot-

game by Cramerton High last Fri-
day afternoon. The score was 14-0.

For the first time since the cloak
of Sugg fell on his shoulders, Ker-
nel feels at the start that he will be
able to fill this column; which
probably means that he will run
dry before the half-way mark is
reached. A lot has happened,
though, so fire the gun, and we'll
be off. (The first guy that says
we've been off all year is a soandso)

Might as well begin with the
game, the classiest Kernel has yet
scen in the South. The game itself
was somewhat of a disappointment,
but our hat is off to Finest playing
against odds we've witnessed in
many a day. By the way, our cyes
must have played tricks on us Sat-
urday. We understand that one
of Carolina’s backs was Little;

they all looked BIG to us.

what the writers, I'm told, call col-
or. And that color is what keeps
Davidson way ‘above the small
school class. _

Special credit, we feel, 1s due the
band and its director. Its things
like that airplane formation and
the step done to “Bolero” that have
put our band on the map. Which
reminds us, we heard the leader of
the Pan-Flellenic’s orchestra re-
mark that we have the best col-
lege band in the country: and he
oughta know. Our congratulations,
