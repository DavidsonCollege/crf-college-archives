Gerschefski Plays
With Concert Band

Celebrated. Guest Pianist Ac-

companies Symphonic Series’
Beginning

Edwin Gerschefski, widely

composer and

Mr.
acclaimed pianist,
teacher, and at present dean of
music at the Converse College
School of Music, will be the guest
soloist at the fall concert of the
Davidson College Symphonic Band,
which is to be presented tonight
at 8:15 o’clock in the Chambers
Auditorium. Mr. Gerschefski will
give a rendition of the extremely
difficult but beautiful “Capriccio
Brilliant,” for pianoforte and band,
by Mendelssohn.

Mr. Gerschefski, whose name and
record are probably unknown to
the average stadent, has achieved
wide acclaim from Jnusicians and
music critics throughout the coun-
try. Holder of the degrees of
Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of
Philosophy from Yale, he has been
the recipient of many awards in
the field of music, including the
Osborne-Kellogg prize, the Charles
Dirson Fellowship, and the Jeffrey
Renolds scholarship. While still
an undergraduate, one of his com-
positions was performed by the
New Haven Symphony Orchestra.
After receiving his degrees he
studied in London for two years,
where he was the first American
to be awarded a diploma for both
piano playing and teaching. Later
he spent some time studying in
Italy, after which he returned to
New York, where he studied under
Joseph Schillinger, famed teacher
of such notables-as George Gersh-
win and Oscar Levant.

Radio Performer

Mr. Gerschefski has been heard
in piano recitals in New York City
and throughout Connecticut, and
has toured through the South in
connection with the Tours Associ-
ation of American Colleges. He
has appeared on all the major radio
networks of the United States, giv-
ing concerts not only of the works
of the great masters of classical
music but also of his own compo-

sitions, including songs, piano
solos, string quartets, and other
combinations.

With reference to his abilities
as pianist and teacher, Bruce Si-
_monds, professor of music and head
of the piano department at Yale
University, said: “Edwin Gers-
chefski is a musician who com-
bines seriousness of-—purpose with
brilliance of technique in a most
stimulating manner. He is an ac-
complished concert pianist and an
experienced teacher whom I can
recommend without reservation to
anyone who wants sensitive musical
training as well as a_ thorough
grounding in the principles of
pianoforte technique.”

Referring to one of Mr. Gers-
chefski’s compositions, “Stream-
line,” Glenn Bainum, director of
the Northwestern University Band
and secretary of the American
Bandmasters association, wired
this to Mr. Gerschefski’s music
publishers:, “‘Streamline’ has a
wallop that is almost unbelievable.
Its appeal, to the imagination is ir-
resistible. The audience became so
excited as to literally shout for
repetition.. Thanks for the privi-
lege of giving it its first perform-
ance.”

Symphonic Band

This concert tonight will be the
first concert to be presented this
year by the Symphonic Band. The
Symphonic Band has acquired an
enviable reputation throughout the
South by its concert tours and its
series of radio broadcasts over
the Dixie Network of the Colum-
bia Broadcasting System. James
Christian Pfohl, | director of the
band and head ‘of the Davidson
Music Department, came to David-
son in 1932 after graduating from
the Uitiversity of Michigan, and
since that time he has_ steadily |
built up the Davidson Band until

dents. Take your check troubles
and all other problems related to
your rights and responsibilities as
a veteran to the VA Training Of-
ficer.

“There are thousands of veterans
enrolled at North Carolina colleges
und univerisities this fall,’ Mr.
Murphy said, “and most of them
wil] get their November  subsist-

checks

ence on time. Those few
who don’t are asked to wait until
November 15. If veteran students
here haven't received their checks

by that time, they should report
the fact to me immediately and
we'll get the matter straightened
out as rapidly as possible.”

Davidson's cirele of Omicron

of the Senior Class and R. Murphy

Y. M. C..A., in its annual fall tap

day held last Friday during the

Seniors who were tapped in-
eluded Richard H. O’Hair, H. Ed.

ert T. Amos, John W. MeAlister,
Price H. Gwynn, and Lamarr Wil-

Dick Port, president of Delta
Circle of ODK, presided over the
meeting, introducing the speaker
of the service, Mr. Frank Jackson,
college treasurer, who was for two
national president of ODK.
Mr. Jackson spoke on the history
and purposes of the fraternity, re-
lating ODK’s founding at Washing-
ton and Lee University to bring
together leaders in the various
phases of campus life. He deseribed

years

asking the question “Is it dif-
ferent?” “Can like other

His
answer to the first was positive and
the second, negative, and he em-
phasized the probability that an-
other war would, in all likelihood,
not destroy the world, but would
certainly plunge us back in to an
age of barbarism. Dr. Foreman
said that unlike the past; war is
now not only impractical, but is
impossible if civilization is to con-
tinue,

a scientific countermeasure?”

Points of View

There are three points of view, he
said, which must not be taken by
a Christian. The first is that we
must not be pessimistic about the
situation, or that no matter what
we do everything will turn out for

the idea that

and turn out for the best. The
third idea that is taboo for the

Christian to take up is one of in-
ditference, for we at
portant crossroad, and we should
‘not be blind to that fact.

Dr. Foreman then brought out
the interesting point that a man is
no longer regarded as a Christian
