_ So what do you want to be when you grow
up?.

Each year hundreds of first year students at
Davidson respond to that and many similar
questions as part of the CSS CIRP survey.

At the same time, a group of seniors, sepa-
rated from their freshmen counterparts by
four years of hard work, late nights, wild
parties, and probing questions, answer the
same battery of questions.

The results can be surprising.

Director of Planning and Institutional Re-
search Linda LeFauve commented on the
numbers for Davidson’ s Class of 2000. “What
we get back is a comparison [of the survey
results] not in particular, but as an aggre-
gate.”

This national survey, based at UCLA and
used by colleges and universities all over the
United States, measures changes in students’
attitudes and perceptions over the course of

pared with the average person of his/her age”
in such areas as general academic ability,
creativity, leadership ability, and both intel-
lectual and social self confidence. The re-
sults list student responses both as entering
freshmen and as graduating seniors and com-
pare them to averages for similar institutions.
- Another area of the survey assesses goals
and expectations. Students are asked to pre-
dict what their academic major will be, what
they expect to do immediately after. graduat-
ing, and what career they eventually hope to

_ pursue.

In addition, some questions call for esti-
mates of how students will spend their time in
college. “These questions ask what you ex-
pect your.involvement to be [while in col-
lege], what kinds of organizations you will

participate in, and how satisfied you expectto:

be,” LeFauve remarked.

Finally, another group of questions mea-
sures political views. Students can respond
to a series of suggested policies, such as
“Abortion should be legal,” or, “The death

a wide array of topics. One important section
deals with students’ self image. “The survey
asks you to rate yourself relative to your peers
in a whole range of academic and social
variables,” explained Ms. LeFauve.

For instance, respondents indicated whether
they felt they were above average “as com-

their stay at a particular institution. The penalty should be abolished,” indicating

As one might expect, students’ views can
change considerably over the course of four
years. In particular, “The self-ratings change
because your normative group changes,”
noted LeFauve. In other words, as students
move from one peer group in high school to
