BOB MILES, EX-11, IS
NEW “Y” SECRETARY

(Continued from page 1)

has finished the theological course a year
ago last May. Soon afterwards Mr.
Miles enlisted in the Army Y. M. C. A.
work, and was stationed at Camp Jack-
son, Then he was sent across, and for
seven months he was with the boys “over
there.” He was returned to this coun-
try in the early fall.

Mr. Miles, in describing the joy he
felt when he heard he was to be sent back
to Davidson, said, “I could hardly hold
myself.” As he walked over the. cam-
pis once more on Tuesday afternoon he
remarked to one of the professors, “You
know these eight years seem like yester-
day now.” Davidson has thus received
back a man of true Davidson mold, and
once more the “Old College” prides her-
self of her alumni. | Mr. Miles has
brought Mrs. Miles with him, and they
will be “permanently” located here till
commencement. “The rooms in the gym-
nasium will continue to be used, and Mr.
Miles requests that the students use him
and the “Y” whenever desired. The one
way in which Davidson stiidents can ex-
press their appreciation of the Y. M.
C. A. and Mr. Miles is through the
hearty co-operation and backing of every
man. |

Mr. Rutland, who came to serve as
“¥"! secretary from Mr. Moore's de-
parture in late November until a per-
manent secretary should be sent, has left
to resume the theological course in Emory
University. During the two wecks Mr.
Rutland was with Davidson he made a
large number of friends, and the best
wishes of all go with him as he leaves.

COLLEGE TO CONTINUE.
AS IN AN‘TE-BELLUM DAYS

.. .s(Continued from page 1) .. ..
for a full fall term's work toward grad-
uation and diploma if they stay.and pass
examinations. No tuition, dormitory
fees or any other charge whatsoever will
be made by the college for the remainder
of the fall term. Men will, of course,
pay their board, and have a few minor
expenses. So why not, when mustered
out, men, stay just two weeks longer and
during those two weeks buckle down. to
conscientious study and pass this work
and get credit? Look ahead; it will
help -you in the end.

If other men who are in the country's
service, when mustered out, desire to re-
turn or come to Davidson, they may
have this fall term’s credit with the S.
A. T. C. men, provided they enroll on
or before next January 7th. Another
splendid offer, ;

Recitations will continue until De-
cember ryth. Examinations will start
Monday, the 16th, and continue until
the afternoon of the 18th. They will be
short, possibly two hours each, three or
four a day. The holidays will be longer
than ever before, lasting from the 18th
to the 7th of January, exactly three
weeks,

Men will be allowed to keep their uni-
forms and shoes, just issued, for a period
of four months. At the end of that
time they will be sent to the Depot
Quartermaster.

Tuesday morning one of the shirts
issued and the rifles were turned in;
after which eyery man was examined
physically, to ascertain whether any
treatment for ailments received while in
the service was necessary. At 1 o'clock
the men signed their discharge papers
preparatory to being mustered out.

As the Davidsonian is going to press,
important papers, records, and certifi-
cates are rapidly being completed. and
by the time the Davidsonian is read, the
Davidson unit of the §. A. T. C. will
most probably be a remembrance of the
past.
