DAVIDSON PROFESSORS
TRAVELLED AND STUDIED

Many Institutions and Countries
Visited by Faculty This
‘ Summer

+ Members of the Davidson College faculty
have materially benefitted themselves this
summer, many of them studying in institu-
tions scattered all over America, while others
chose to spend their time and obtain the
accruing benefits by traveling in Europe,
Africa and Asia.

Dr. W. R. Grey, Dr. J. M. Douglas and
Dr. J. M. McConnell, all studied at Colum-
bia University in New York. Prof. Ernest
J. Cullum spent six weeks at the Harvard
University summer school. Dr. W. P. Cum-
ming, Prof. J. H. Davis, Jr., and Prof. T.
E. ,Lothery, Jr., were students at the Uni-
versity of. Chicago, and Prof. W. R. Weaver,
Jr., attended Middlebury College, school of
Spanish in Vermont.

Among those traveling were Dr. M. E.
Sentelle, dean and professor of Bible and
philosophy, who spent three months in Egypt,
Palestine, Syria, Sicily and Greece; Dr. T.
W. Lingle, who has been touring for seven
months in northern Africa, Asia and south-
ern Europe; Prof. H. T. Lilly and Prof. A.
V. Goldiers, who have been in Europe, the
latter in Spain most of the time; Dr. W. P.
Cumming, who went to Alaska after study-
ing at the University of Chicago, and Prof.
F. K. Fleagle, who toured central America
and studied a while in Mexico City. Miss
Cornelia Shaw, librarian, has also been in
Europe this summer, the major portion of
her time being spent in Norway and Sweden.

chairman of the educational committee gave
him an added insight.
It is felt at Davidson that Dr. Lingle is
one of the most capable men in the South-
ern Presbyterian Church. He is a lecturer,
a writer, an experienced executive and edu-
cator, and has a wide range of friends
throughout the south and in many northern
cities.
He has already written a message to the
alumni, friends and students of Davidson,
and the portion which dealt primarily with
the students is quoted below: \

“T wish that I might know every student
personally, That may be impossible. It is a

‘rather large contract to learn to know six

hundred men personally, in addition to per-
forming all the duties which belong to the
president’s office. But if that is not possible,
I would like for every student to feel that
I am always accessible, whether in my office,
in my home, or on the campus, and that I
will always count it a privilege to be of any
possible service. I feel that this same thing
can be said for every member of the faculty.
The college exists for the sake of the stu-
dents. The president and the faculty are there
for the sake of the students. We are eager
to be of the largest possible service.”
