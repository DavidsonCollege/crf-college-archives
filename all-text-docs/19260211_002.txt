Wildkittens Lose Again As
Duke Wins Fast Game

Duke Freshmen Wir Win by Score of
26-12 as Bird Stars for Visitors

The Duke University Freshmen swamped
the Wildkittens in their own lair Thursday
night and recked revenge for the oft-repeated
triumphs of Davidson over the Methodists.
The final score of the game was 26 to 12,
which pictured accurately the difference be-
twen the playing of the two teams.

Lead by a flashy, red-headed Bird, who
scored five field goals, more than the entire
Davidson quint,
the Wildkittens after they had run the score
up to Davidson 6, Duke 2. The’ first half
ended with tht Methodists leading by one
field goal at 8-6.

It was in the first of the second period that
the visitors showed their real form, scoring
cight consecutive field goals and running the
score up to 24-8 before the Davidson crew
could locate the basket from the field.

Crawford, Davidson's captain, after lead-
ing a rather futile long-distance attack, con-
nected with two neat shots in the last few
minutes of play, starting what looked like a
neat rally.

Bird was very evenly divided,
other men getting one or more field goals,
Gattling being next to Bird with five points.
He and Candler stood out as two exceptional
guards, while Leftwich for Davidson also
looked best at this position.

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

We've had a number of athletic contests at !
Davidson for the past week or two, and now |
we are to go lacking for a while.

The wrestling team is up in Vir-
ginia now, with the University of

Virginia to be met tonight, and V. P.

I. Saturday night.

The freshmen are away on a trip. Last
night they played Oak Ridge. Tonight they
are handling State, or vice versa. Friday
| night the little Deacons have a second chance
jat the yearlings. And Saturday night the
Duke team will entertain them on their home

court. Furthermore, there might be a game
somewhere in North Carolina with another
team Monday night, so Manager Christen-

bury remarked before leaving.

After the game here with Furman Satur- |
day night the Wildcat varsity team will start |
| toward the Southern regions, meeting Clem- |
son on Monday night, Furman on Tuesday, |
land) Wofford on Wednesday, at Clemson,
/Greenville and Spartanburg, respecively, all
ensconced in the Sandlapper State.

Only a day of rest are allowed
them, and the Wildcats start another
journey of more potency, because of
state signifance. The State Techmen
will cavort with the Wildcats in
Raleigh on the night of February 20. |
With Sunday sandwiched in their
schedule Duke at Durham February
22, Carolina at Chapel Hill and Wake
Forest at Wake Forest follow on
consecutive nights.

Thus devotees of sportdom can watch the
spring football practice and give their moral
|Support to the coaches. The squad is dimin-
ishing in size. We suggested that some of
the aspirants show more of that “sticktoitive-
ness.” Grammarians are asked not to con-
sider the word just used. We are aiming at
‘the thought.

It won't be football alone long, for Coach
Tex Tilson says that the baseball men are |
going to be called for duty the middle of
|this month, with Captain Frank Alford in
charge.. Then you can listen to the crack of |
| the bat, which intermingled with the thud
lof bodies in impact will keep music in the
air on Sprunt Field,

Add to that the tramp of the track men,7
jand you'll have the spring schedule com-
plete. The cinder path men, and the field
; event men are to be issued an invitation the |
|middle of the shortest month i in the year, sim-
| ultaneously with the urge on the basebalt
| players,

By the way, we hope students have
not. forgotten that we are to have
a state high school track meet here
this spring. The one of last year was
merely a starter, insignificant as com-
pared with the one that is being plan-
ned for this year.

Everybody was new at the game of hand-
ling such a meet, but announcement was made
last year that never again would there be
any confusion whatsoever, and that before |
the first pistol shot of the event occurred |
every minute detail would have been ar-
ranged, and that students would know what |
to expect before they come to Davidson for
this occasion.

Urge that high school of yours back home
to be well represented here, and if it is a.
small high school, ask them to send along
what they have. Competition will be keen,
and the gathering interesting. The more the
merrier, as the old adage goes.

We hesitate to comment on the freshman
team this week. In the Duke game our hopes |
were still left, cven though the Methodist
yearlings won. But after the Wake Forest |
game, we wonder what the final result will
be. Exensive comment is deferred until after |
the state trip. We suggest that a little more |
life be shown on the court, that they move |
around @ great deal more than they do, and |
that they work together as a team, and not |
as an individual player, trying to sce how |
much honor each one can get.

Davidson Wrestlers Win
'29-0 From Concord Team

Coach Weems 1s Withholds Letter
Men for Virginia Trip—Others
Winning Each Month

Last Monday night the Davidson wrestling

Concord “Y” team by the score of 29-0. The
score tells a different tale from the real
events of the match. As a matter of fact the
Davidson team had extreme difficulty in
winning all of the matches. The Davidson
team was composed entirely of non-letter
men, which made the match more even.
Mauldin made the best showing of the even-
ing, throwing his opponent in two minutes
and eight seconds. Cole was Concord’s best
man, losing his match to Bohannon by a
\time of two minutes and fifteen seconds.
Four of the matches were won on falls and
three on time.
Intermixed with the wrestling matches
were three boxing bouts. These proved to
| be the greatest feature of the evening. The
match between Dick Flynn and Dick Grey
| was especially fast and furious. The others,
however, did not fall far short of this one.

115 pound class—-McLeod,

125 pound class—Flythe, of Davidson, won

135 pound class—Hansel, of Davidson, won |

145 pound class—Garrison, of Davidson,

158 pound class—Bohannon, of Davidson,

175 pound class—Crinkley, Davidson,
won from Hoover( captain), of Concord, by
a fall in three minutes and fifteen seconds.

Heavyweight class—Mauldin, of Davidson,
won from Erwin, of Concord, by a fall in
two minutes and eight seconds.

of

The three boxing matches were three-round

affairs, The first two matches had two-min-
ute rounds and the last had minute and a half
rounds. Crawford won from Embrey in the
first match by a clear decision. In the second
bout Kearns won from Copeland. The third
bout between Grey and Flynn was very close-

Reports are current that we might |

get two of the best high school ath-
letes in North Carolina, and at the
same time two of the finest men in
the state. Their first choice is Da-
vidson, and we hope that it will be
the ultimate choice. One of their
classmates made the remark that they

da ry

ts of r ative e.
That’s the kind of men we want at
Davidson. Here's a hope that they'll
be traversing the walks of this cam-
pus next fall, with a little trotting up
and down the football field inter-
spersed with their meanderings,
