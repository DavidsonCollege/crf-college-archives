Cable in dorm rooms looks unlikely

Students, administrators speak out against cable television at exploratory forum

By Micuaet J. Kruse
Editor Emeritus

Students and administrators gathered
Thursday night in Chambers Gallery to dis-
cuss the potential implications of cable tele-
vision installation in dorm rooms.

But the forum quickly turned to a dispute
over cable’s rightful place amongst other
pressing Campus issues.

“T have a problem with this debate as a
whole,” said junior David Farnum. “Sexual-
ity, gender relations, you name it, it’s more
important than cable. This is a petty debate.
I’m kind of disgusted.”

“T really feel like this issue is not as
important as some of the others on campus,”
added freshman Beth Gardner, an SGA sena-
tor. “Other issues are definitely more press-
ing.”

Problems such as race and gender rela-
tions, recycling, student apathy, and the

Outpost’s fate arose a number of times over

the hour-long meeting.

But cable TV has elicited more campus
banter of late than just about anything else.
Like it or not, itis an issue, thanks in large part
to sophomore Joey Harris.

Harris, who earlier this month began his
term as SGA Vice President, presented a
resolution on November 9 calling for the
administration to “explore the option.”

“We asked the administration to explore

Panel to discuss learning

With an average SAT score in the 1300s,
many would assume that academic and intel-
lectual life has been a care-free journey for
just about every student at Davidson College.

Far from it.

Associate Dean of Students Leslie
Marsicano estimates that between 80-100
Davidson students have some degree of a
diagnosed learning disability, ranging from
dyslexia to ADD.

In an ongoing effort to understand the
challenges of students’ learning disabilities,
the college will sponsor a Learning Disabili-

the option,” explained Harris.
“And then when it made the
front page of The Davidsonian
and just took off from there.”

President Bobby Vagt met
with SGA Nov. 16 to address
the resolution.

“From my perspective,
this is not just a simple issue
about whether or not you have
cable. It gets at the heart of
pulling people apart,” he said
that night.

“Every May there are 400
absolutely incredible people that
walk across that lawn. I don’t
think that’s an accident. I think
it’s because we are a commu-
nity. And I don’t want to em-
brace the idea of just one more
opportunity to isolate people.”

Still, many students ex-
pressed a sense of entitlement
toward cable viewing.

“At the age of 20,” sopho-
more Henry Briffel said, “if I’m
going to go out and socialize, I’m going to go
out and socialize. I think cable is another
outlet for entertainment and academic expe-
rience.”

A number of students at Thursday’s fo-
rum cited cable news networks such as
MSNBC, CNBC, and CNN as potential op-
portunities to augment their
overall educational experi-
ence.

Junior Cameron
Richardson disagrees.

“T really have a lot of
trouble understanding why
we have to watch TV to get
the news,” she said. “Read
a newspaper.

“If we endorse cable, that’s
saying it’s just as important
achoice as anything else. I
don’t think it is.” ;

Neither does the adminis-
tration. Vagt and Dean of
Students Tom Shandley are

ties Awareness Forum at 7:30 PM on Tues-
day, March 14.

The panel discussion—including college
faculty members, students, counselors, and
psychologists—will be held in the Morrison
Room of the College Union.

“Our primary goal is to increase campus

awareness of these disabilities,” says Paul
Gravel, a Davidson junior who suffers from
dyslexia and attention deficit disorder.
Gravel acknowledges that the college
effectively addresses many issues facing stu-
dents with learning disabilities. Any student
with a history of learning disabilities may
undergo an evaluation by a college-desig-
nated learning psychologist in Charlotte. That

‘ decidedly anti-cable.

“This isn’t about giving everybody ev-
erything he or she wants,” Vagt told the
smallish crowd of a couple dozen. “That’s
never happened in my lifetime, and it’s prob-
ably not going to happen in yours.

“This isn’t about TV. And it’s not about
trusting your judgement.”

What it is about; he maintained, is
Davidson’s much-talked-about community —
and the effect cable TV would or could have
on it.

“Do we provide people with another
option not to be together?” Vagt asked. “I
think we’re improved by the time we spend
with each other.”

Cable would actually be a money-mak-
ing proposition for the college. The service
would most likely entail a per-semester fee
for each individual student or room.

$20 to $25 a semester. But. there are no
definite dollar figures at this point.

pus facilities, according to Dean of Resi-
dence Life Kurt Holmes, are well-equipped
to be cable-ready sooner rather than later.

“Tt would be easy to say, ‘OK, let’s hook
itup,”” Shandley explained. “But I think we
have to be more thoughtful than that. We
need to take advantage of what is an incred-
ibly talented student body. I don’t think cable
is a good idea at all.”

Especially, Holmes says, with TV
lounges on every residence hall. Answering
Harris’s other SGA resolution, the college
has promised that each hall will have its own
lounge complete with cable access beginning
this fall. The construction of a new dormi-
tory has opened enough beds on campus for
RLO to allot one or two rooms per hall to a
new lounge.

Holmes has expressed no public opposi-
tion to cable, but he hopes that the new
lounges will help answer students’ call for
increased access to cable television. “We
need to give the new lounges a chance.”

specialist then makes recommendations to
the college regarding special accommoda-
tions, ranging from extra time on tests to
textbooks on tape.

But many unnecessarily feel that a dis-

ability diagnosis indicates weakness as a stu-
dent at Davidson when, as Gravel suggests
those students with learning disabilities have
