provided the “woman's touch"
and Steve the strong back that

success of the brcaks (any lack
of success can be laid to
odministrative orror).

THE FINALE?

Profcssor Griffin said to mo
of his classcs this summer, "Gentlc-
men, this is thc end of the last
class, but it is not the end of
the lesson."

I hud o talk with a friend
who was recently greduated from
Davidson.and has gonc to work for
Q& Charlottc firm. He said, "I
hove learned more here in a few
months than I learned in © full
four ycors at Davidson.”

-l1 supposc that we will have
to be graduated and gone from
vevidson for some timc before we
realize the true significance
of these statoments. I would
suggest this, howovcr: We will
leave Davidson ab the end of our
time having learned nothing but
how to learn,

If this is true, then David-
son hds accomolishcd her mission.
We will thcn go into the world
as graduatcs in 9 libcra] arts
program who are prepared to leam
the overwhclmingly hard lessons
that the world has to teach us.

Now wo dobatc the Berlin
crisis in an academic fashion, for
it only scems to threoten e@ cloudy
past thet surrounds our pérents
and the world outside Davidson.
But when we face the world and
try to make our way, we will fim
that Berlin is a thrcot to us in
our new way of life, separate
from our paronts,

Then, wo will apply our ability
to lcarn and undorstand to our
problems as they faco us and not
as vic read of them in texts ond
newspapers. Until I can really
know the truth, I would suggcst
that this is thc true significonce
of the two statcments that lead
this cditorial.
