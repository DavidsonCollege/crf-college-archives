To Feature Lloyd Price

The Social Council has added
rock ‘n roll star Lloyd Price
to the entertainment for Mid-
winters next weekend.

**Mr. Personality,’’ accompa-
nied by a 14-piece band, will per-
form at a dance to be held Satur-
day night from 8 to 12, at the
Lake Norman House of Music,
located 15 minutes from the
campus.

A unique song stylist, Price
has recorded several ‘‘million-
sellers,” including ‘‘Personal-
ity,” “Stagger Lee” and “I'm
Gonna Get Married,” During his
career, which began in New Or-
leans, he has crisscrossed the
country making night club and
television appearances as well
as performing for the armed
forces overseas.

Dan Campbell. Social Council
chairman, said that all students
will be required to show their
ID cards and advance tickets
for guests—one dollar stag or
drag—will be on sale at the
Union desk. By requiring ad-
vance tickets. Campbell hopes
to prevent any problems with
outsiders.

Campbell said that maps will
be distributed at chapel Thurs-
day and that a bus will be mak-
ing round trips at regular in-
tervals for these without trans-
portation.

Campbell also pointed out that,
although the dance will be held
off campus, the faculty drinking
rule applies just the same. The
rule prohibits students from pos-
sessing, or being under the in-

ule had been set for the open
houses beginning February 27.
There will be from six to nine

members at each house will be
announced in THE DAVIDSON-
IAN and in the Vespers bulletin.

nity presidents in their proposals
and objections to the recent So-
cial Life Evaluation Committee
recommendations to the faculty.

American college students are
standing in the midst of a new
world and are unsure just what
they want to do with it, a former
Yale professor told the student
body Monday in a serious mes-
sage laced with rare good
humor.

After being introduced by Will
Terry, Dr. John Oliver Nelson,
who was described by one stu-

j|dent as looking “like Jack Lem-

mon playing Teddy Roosevelt."
admitted, “I am bristling with
prejudices."

He continued. '‘A man of my
generation can't stand up here
and tell men of your generation
how you feel.” Then he pro-
ceeded to make a pretty fair

He further characterized to-
day's students as “a genera-
tion morally worried.”

‘Does Hugh Hefner set the
sex ethic of young men in Amer-
ica?”’ Nelson asked--and then
answered: “I think he does."

MORAL ESCAPISTS

Young people today are moral
escapists. thus the popularity
of amoral spy heroes. Codes are
rejected. There is somehow a
new moral concern, however.

For instance, ‘‘There is a
moral quality to the draft-card
burners,"’ which other students
recognize even though they dis-
agree with that position.

Nelson helpfully concluded,
“There are no easy answers.
This is a gruelling time for
moral judgments because you're
pretty much on your own.”

Because of today’s moral and

age which {s critical of religion.”
On campuses of non-church-re-
lated schools, the church's at-
tempts to reach the students are
becoming unstructured and in-
effective. Today, ‘Religion must
be expressed in the language of
this day,’ must be ‘‘intellectual-
ly respectable.”

Finally Dr. Nelson said of us,
today's collegians: ‘‘In this gen-
eration you're more personaily
lonely than any previous genera-
tion,’ This sense of alienation.
he said, ‘‘has to do with the fact
that you can't communicate with
the older generation.”

“This generation has a sixth
sense for phoniness,” he admit-
ted, but he asked, “Are you
more honest than the older gen-
eration, or just more impa-
tient?"’ He finally admonished
that students must somehow find

not to panic. ‘We always end
up with beds that are not used.

If students will just sign our .

waiting list, and then check back
from time to time, they'll prob-

| ably get a place.*’

She also asked students to
show more courtesy about can-
cellations—especially if they will
house their dates in town.

College’s Placement Service
Offers Students Many Benefits

By BILL SEIGLER
Davidsonian Staff Writer

“I have certainly never re-
gretted the day that I decided
to go through the Placement
Service at Davidson College. It
has been beneficial to me in
more ways than one,” conclud-
ed Tommy James Jr., class of
°65, who is now working for
Tennessee Eastman Company.

The local College Placement
Service, headed by C. Shaw
Smith .has operated here since
the end of World War ‘II. Last
year it was used by 50 students.
15 of whom were available for
immediate employment.

The high standing of the local
service is demonstrated by
Smith being president of the
Southern College Placernent
Service Association, and his be-
ing on special assignment from
the Ford Foundation for cam-
pus visitations.

Many Davidson students, es-
pecially those interested in grad-
uate work, fail to take advan-
tage of the service, according to

Smith. He emphasizes that ‘the
service is not a process to get
a job,"’ that it can be as im-
portant to those going to grad-
uate school or into military serv:
ice as to those seeking imme-
diate emplyment.

LIKE MARRIAGE

In an article in the CPS maga-
zine, Smith says ‘‘Job-hunting
is like marriage, you must be-
gin hunting and courting now,
not when you are ready to get
married.”

Ways in which the Placement
Service aids the student include:

—Providing him with inter-
view experience:

—Learning company needs
and opportunities and perhaps
making graduate school study
more practical;

—furnishing graduate place-
ment services with undergrad-
uate files, thus giving a more
complete picture of MA and
PhD job candidates;

—making a file for the stu-
dent and helping his self-apprais-

HOW DOES A POLACK PROTEST?
“Stupidest, Greasiest Form Of Human Alive”

—possibly finding future em-
ployment.

Costs to the participating stu-
dent are minimal: 50 cents for
an annual picture, six dollars
for the printing of 100 copies of
the individual resume with im-
printed picture and one dollar
for every transcript over one.

Included in the program is an
extensive battery of tests free of
charge which, according to Stu-
dent Counseling Director Wil-
liam B. Hight, is being given
“to more and more students
every year.”

FOUR O'CLOCK TALKS

Smith points to the ‘four
o'clock talks’ with visiting com-
pany representatives as oppor-
tunities for all students to ac-
quaint themselves with business,
“without dressing or formality:
they are just talks.”

According to Smith, about 60
companies visit the campus for
interviews annually, and more
would come if there were mofe
interest among the students. He
stresses that ‘‘the Placement
Service is now part of the aca-
demic process . . . helping a
man decide what to do with his
life... and... whether or
not he wants business for a ea-
reer.”’

Polack Jokes Invade Campus

Who is the only person who
has never heard a Polack joke?
A Polack. The reason he has
not is because the main source
of Polack jokes are colleges all
over the country and Polacks
have never heard of college,
much less been to one.

Why everyone hates the Po-
lacks is one question about them
that no one has been able to
answer yet. Nobody knows one,
but everybody knows that they
are the stupidest, greasiest,
most ridiculous form of human
alive. Not much else is known
about them or their origin.

Of course it is common know!-
edge that they first got to Amer-
jca by letting one swim the
ocean and then the rest of them
walked over on the grease slick,
but anything else about their
emergence from obscurity is
sort of hazy.

But that doesn’t matter. What
does matter is that they are so
much inferior to everyone else

of Slater Service.

“I realize the Slater image is
poor with students here,’’ he
said. ‘My job is to build it up
with better-than-standard serv-
ice. This restaurant idea is just
one additional service to offer.”

The dinner, which will be held
in the main cafeteria room. will
offer waiter service, ‘‘orders to
order” and food prepared a-la-|
carte. The meals will range in
priee from $1.25 to $3.50.

Included on the bill of fare will
be appetizers, three styles of
steak, a variety of sea food.
vegetables, rolls and hush pup
pies, beverages and desserts.

“It'll be the best place to eat
within 20 miles,’ promised So-
cial Council Chairman Dan
Campbell.

ful next weekend. Beckham
promises to make it. a regular
feature at big weekends.

Students Will Attend

Davidson College will repre-
sent the Dominican Republic at
Duke University this weekend at
the eighth annual Middle South
United Nations: Model General
Assembly.

The main purpose of the en-
terprise is to learn more about
the role and the activities of the
United Nations in the world. its
failures and its successes. More
than 80 countries will be repre-
sented by four-man delegations
from the participating colleges
and universities.

Sponsored by .the Student
Council, the delegation from
Davidson is made up of George
Nzongola. John Thomas. Tom
Earnhardt and Sam Johnson.
The delegates have prepared

level on the social scene. Every-
one can understand and laugh
at a Polack joke because no one
is a Polack—at least in his own
mind.

After searching the campus,
one comes to the conclusion that
although everyone denies being
a Polack there are plenty around
—the zit next door, the fly down
the hall or the ‘‘greasy’’ townie
in the next booth at Hattie's.
But if you ask him, he will deny
it, which isnot surprising, since
Polacks are too stupid to know
how terrible they are anyway.
They do not even know they are
Polacks,

Whoever started the Polack
craze has sucessfully remained
in anonymity even though there
is no reason to fear retaliation
from his victims—Polacks are
too stupid to get revenge, or
it, which is not surprising, since
even to know they are being
picked on. Why he started it is
as unknown as who he is, unless
he is some third class citizen
who decided it would be nice to

have someone lower than him-
self to cut down.

Polack jokes seem to have
some unending source. You think
you have heard every one but
there is always another you have
never heard before. Why does a
Polack funeral only have two
pallbearers? Because trash
cans only have two handles.

What does a flamingo have in
his front yard? A plastic Po-
lack. Why can Polacks not swim
in Lake Michigan? Because they

APATHY CLUB

“Several years ago,’ Nelson
observed, ‘‘almost every cam-
pus had an apathy club which
met periodically to choose the
apathy of ‘the week.” He esti-
mated that even today about 80
per cent of students just do not :
care."'

Apathy is pretty characteristic
of this generation,’’ according
to the speaker. who summed up
the prevailing campus attitude
in these words: ‘‘Blessed is he
that expecteth nothing for he
shall not be disappointed.”

Nelson went on to surmise that
this unconcern is the result of
the fact that students have ‘‘left
home but don't have family re-
sponsibility. It's a rather unreal
kind of time.” ;

“As a result.’’ he said, ‘‘most
of you are vocationally uhde-
cided to an extent that has not gag
been true in the past." This in
turn causes a man ‘0 lose this
energy and ambition. before he .
knows what to do with it.

On the international scene, the

Commenting on the forthcom-

“We look forward to participat-

Davidson's drinking and frater-

that remains for us is ‘How close

will leave a ring. And hundreds
of others, most of which cannot
be repeated here.

Besides the unanswerable
question of why everyone likes
Polack jokes so much, the main
question is why do Polacks not
get offended when they hear
jokes about themselves, or when
they read them. No one really
knows the answer to this either,
unless it is that Polacks cannot
read and they cannot understand
the jokes when they hear them.
