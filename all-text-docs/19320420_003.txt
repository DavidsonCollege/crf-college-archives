ODI CASALI

Davidson’s track teams showed up well |
last Saturday when they turned in their
first victories of the season. The varsity
especially performed nobly in doubling the
score on V. P. I.’s Gobblers. Prior to the
meet Saturday, the Wildcats had not tasted
of victory in two attempts, and likewise (or
vice versa) the Gobblers had not tasted of
defeat in the same number of attempts. But
Saturday the worm turned and Davidson
emerged victorious over a hitherto unbeaten
team. oo

te,
a

Captain “Soup” Brannon seems to be in
a class all of his own. Since coming to Da-
vidson, “Soup” has set new records in both
the mile and two-mile runs. He has broken
his old record in the two-mile on several
occasions, and seems to set a new one each
time only to break it himself. Saturday he
lowered his two-mile mark to ten minutes,
two and’ five-tenths seconds, clipping no less
than five full seconds off his old mark. It
wouldn’t surprise us in the least to see
“Soup” bring the mark below ten minutes
the next time he runs the event. If Brannon
keeps up his good work he ought to have
things pretty much his own way in the State
Meet in Greensboro this year.

“Big Jim” Swart, V. P. I’s threat in the
weight events, failed to live up to expecta-
tions in the meet. He put the shot over 47
and a half feet to win first in the event, but
could do no’ better than 124 feet, 2 inches in
the discus throw and consequently lost out
to Pete Knox, who threw it a foot farther.

Rhinehardt, of the visitors, furnished the
thrills of the meet. He pushed Fleagle in
both the 100 and 220-yard dashes, and then
in the 880-yard, after trailing the first lap,
he exerted himself to reach the tape ahead
of Gwynn.

Davidson’s golf team will have four of its
busiest days of the season beginning today.
Foursomes will be played with Carolina,
Duke, and N. C. State on successive days,
and Saturday the team will enter the State
Meet, which is to be held in Greensboro.
Last year the Davidson golf team won the
state championship and has a good chance
of repeating this year.

The Davidson track team meets another
Virginia foe this week-end at Lexington.
Va. V. M. I. will be encountered in what

should prove to be one of the Wildcats’
hardest meets.

Wildkittens Defeat
Hickory High School

Monday, April 18, the Davidson Wildkittens
met and defeated Hickory high school at Hick-
ory by a 6-5 score. Ashton pitched very well
for the ’Kittens, opposing Abernathey and Biv-
ens of Hickory.

K. D. Weeks led the hitting for the David-
son team, getting two hits out of four times
at bat, while Burns and Payne tied for honors

for Hickory. The game was very close -through-
out.

DAVIDSON TRACKMEN DOWN V. P. ‘I

Davidson Nine Trounced
By Elon Christians, 7-4

The Elon Christians took an early lead over
the Davidson nine here last Thursday to’ finally
defeat them 7 to 4. The Christians totalled
twelve hits which netted them victory.

Most of the batters for the visitors followed
up Reiber who led the hitting~ with a triple,
double and single in four trips. They were
pounding the pill hard, for eleven putouts were
accredited to the Davidson outfielders.

The Wildcats played a tight game, but luck
seemed to hold victory beyond their grasp.
They hit Mann, Elon twirler, for nine bingles
which profited them only three runs, though
they bounced three of their hits in the third
inning, four in the fifth, and two in the last
frame. Davidson was able to get’only one hit in
the ninth. Bradsher led the Davidson hitters
with a double and two singles in five trips to
the plate.

’Cat Tennis Team Is
Victor Over Furman

Winning but one out of three matches on
their southern tour, the Davidson tennis team
returned last Thursday. Emory and South Car-
olina both routed the Wildcats, but the locals
defeated Furman, 9-0. The [Emory team de-
feated Davidson in Atlanta Monday afternoon,
six matches to three. Jimmie Halverstadt, Num-
ber 1 for Davidson, featured the afternoon's
play by defeating Boykin of Emory, 6-1, 8-6.

In the match with Furman the ’Cats defeated
the Purple Hurricane 9-0. Furman won but two
sets out of the entire meet. On the following
day Davidson met defeat at the hands of the
University of South Carolina netters, 5-4. Earli-
er in the season the. Cats beat South Carolina,
5-4. During the entire set-to the Gamecocks
waged an uphill battle, but finally emerged vic-
torious at 5 to 4.

Wildcats, was performing nicely and the
test was anything but “all Duke.” In
canto, however, the slugging aces. of the Blue
Devils gave vent to their pent-up wrath and
lashed at the offerings of Pearce with all fury.
After the dehris had been cleared away, the
scorekeeper’s pad showed a sum of six hits and
five tallies for the visitors. From thence onward
was a period of uninteresting baseball which
prolonged the advent of the end of a game which
was conceded to Duke.

The inability to hit was the
ness of the Wildcats. Pearce hurled nice ball
for seven innings, but when the eighth rolled
around he weakened sufficiently for the oppos-
ing batsmen to run rampant.

Big Five baseball circles, and, needless to say,
she made a very auspicious entrance. Last year
the Blue Devils copped the Big Five champion-
ship. Should they continue the excellent work
shown in this game, they have
of retaniing the championship.

Only two extra base hits were made during
the fracas. One was a double by Mathis of the

‘Cats, and the other a terrific home wallop by
McKeithan. McKeithan’s circuit blow occurred
in the second inning and brought Pechan, who
was on first, in before him.

BRANNON SETS RECORD

ate Davidson Captain Breaks Old Record

in Two-Mile Run

Both the varsity and freshman track teams
won its first victory of the season when two
V. P. I. teams were defeated at Richardson
Field Saturday. The Wildcats decisively
whipped the V. P. I. Gobblers by an 84% to
4114 score, while the Wildkittens eked a 61-56
victory over the visiting freshmen.

In the varsity meet, Davidson took ten firsts _
and tied for first in another event, to pile up
its large score. One event, the broad jump, was
swept by the Wildcats, the visitors failing to

place a man.
The surprise of the afternoon came when
Knox, of Davidson, hurled the discus 125 feet

2 inches to rob Big Jim Swart, V. P. Is star

weight man, of first place in the event. Swart
was true to form in the shot put and copped
that even with a distance of 47 feet 6% inches.

Rhinehardt, of the visitors, led the individual
scoring by taking first in the 880-yard run and
seconds in the 100 and 220-yard dashes for a
total of eleven points. Fleagle, Davidson's dash
star, was second with ten points gathered by
taking firsts in the 100 and 220-yard dashes.

Captain Brannon, of the Wildcats, set a new
Davidson record for the two-mile run when
he ran the event in 10 minutes 2.5 seconds.
Henry Rhyne, after high jumping 5 fect 11
inches, attempted a new record in that cvent
but failed to clear the bar in three tries.
