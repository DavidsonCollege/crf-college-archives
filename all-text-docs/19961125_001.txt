Project Life types
363 more people

By JENNIFER STARR
Staff Writer

Three hundred and sixty-three
members of the Davidson commu-
nity had their bone marrow typed
during Project Life’s seventh an-
nual drive held last week.

According to Project Life Co-
Chair Liz Abernathy, this. year’s
drive was the second most suc-
cessful in the group’s history. In
addition, the drive was observed
by a student from UNC-Chapel
Hill andanemployee of First Union
who are both interested in starting
a similar drive.

Over 2,000 people have been
typed through Project Life’s an-
nual drive, and seven of these
people have become bone marrow
donors. Project Life planned a
prize-drawing for all freshman halls
with 100% participation. At press
time, no freshmen halls had full
participation.

Many of those involved in the

drive feel a personal commitment
to the cause.

Scottie Lindsay was motivated
to join the bone marrow depart-
ment ofthe Red Cross because of
her family’s experiences. Her son
David, now a Davidson graduate,
had leukemia and required a bone
marrow transplant from his sister.
His experience inspired students
to start Project Life, which his sis-
ter Sara headed last year.

She believes the drive was a
success "It’s overwhelming ... Ev-
ery one here seems to want to be
here. The committee seems to have
done a good job of educating
people,” she says.

Those being typed seemed to
share the enthusiasm. “I feel good.
I can’t think of an easier way to do
an incredibly important thing.
Watching the McCarthy-Roberts
family’s experience encouraged
me to [be typed],” says Gardner
Roller Ligo, Merit Scholarship
Coordinator.

Cornelius brewery to open

Exits 25 and 28 offer many more options

By Grec GARRISON
Staff Writer

Along with the recent addi-
tions of Chili’s and Fudruckers at
Exit 25, Lake Norman Brewing
Company, a combination brew-
ery, restaurant, and pub in
Cornelius, will tentatively open for
dinner in mid-December. After its
grand opening ceremony in Janu-
ary, lunch will also be served there.

The bar is the brainchild of
Ray Renshaw, an airline pilot who
decided that a brewpub is just what
Lake Norman needs. “We started
work on it a couple of years ago,”
says Renshaw. “I had an idea, so I
got together with some friends and
their families, and we’ve all been
working on it together since.”

Joe Baltos, one of LNBC’s
investors, says, “I’mconfident that

on tap.”

Customers will be able to take
a look at the brewing process; the
beer will be brewed on site, in an
apparatus that fills a glass-walled
room.

Then it will be pumped into.a
refrigerated room, where it will be
stored and then sent through pipes
to the taps at the bar.

Initially, LNBC will make five
different ales, and the brewmaster,

Dana MacGregor Fischer, says that -

they will add more to their brew
menu soon after opening.

He hopes to have a stout by
late January or early February, and
eventually they may produce a la-
ger, as well as seasonal brews.

Fischer, who earned an under-
gtaduate degree in philosophy,

SGA hopes that off-campus businesses will accept cat cards

Burk hopes that despite problems students will be able to charge at local restaurants next semester

By ALEX OBREGON
Staff Writer

This idea of instituting cat
cards off-campus has been in the
works since first semester of last
year, and the SGA, in conjunction
with Auxiliary Services, has been
at work this year drawing up a
contract for the businesses.

The program is aimed at es-

the student body, such as Harris

Junior Buster Burk, Co-Chair-
man of the Student Advisory Coun-

Services says, “Oh the places you’ ll

the technology involved in the
project.

The company ISDN Technol-
ogy will make it easier and cheaper
for business to connect to the cat
card accounts using swipe ma-
chines like the ones currently used
on campus. Problems that have
arisen involve deliveries, such as
pizza deliveries, because they
would require students to give driv-

ers their social security or college
identification number since swipe
machines could not be installed in
delivery vehicles.

Those involved say the
program’s goal is to extend cat
card use off-campus without hurt-
ing the use of on-campus facilities
like Vail Commons, the Union
Cafe, and the Outpost.
