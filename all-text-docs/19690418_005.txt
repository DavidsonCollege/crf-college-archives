pm.

Davidson is the defending
champion. The Wildcats out-
distanced Catawba College,
63-50, in the event last year,
as Cumberland (Ky.), Pern-,
broke, and Presbyterian fol-
lowed, in that order.

Besides the. top five teams
from last year, Berry (Ga.)
College, West Georgia, UNC-
C, Emory, Western Carolina.
Mars Hill, Appalachian State,
Campbell College, Elon, High

Davidson Relays, when 15
squads were entered. David-

Whinle and fls gtaff have.
been working all week in
preparation for the Relays.
Besides sending the -traek
team thrgugh their usual
Workouts, the coaches have
been working to get the track
in good condition.

“I'm expecting a goo:l
crowd,” Whittle said. “Of
course it won't be as large as
last year's when Spring Fro.
Niecs coincided with the Re-
lays, but I still think a lot of
students will come out to see
us. It's the biggest home
event of the season." ,

The Davidson Relays were
initiated in 1959 as a relay
meet for Southern non-sub-
sidized schools. The Wildcats
have dominated the event
since its conception, having
been victors in eight of the
previous 10 events.

However, one part of the
original plan no longer exists.
Since few schools now do not
subsidize track, this year's
field consists of a majority
of colleges which give track
scholarships.

Since most of the schools in
the Davidson Relays this year
are small schools. the seven
relay races will. put a big
hardship on the little track
teams. Only Appalachian,
which will bring a 35-man
squad, will enter all events.

Davidson will enter no one

Maloy And Lefty
Tops At Banquet

All-American Mike Maloy
received’ the most awards,
‘while ex-Wildcat coach Lefty
Driesell was given the most
praise at the annual basket:
ball banquet held Wednesday
night.

Maloy was named as the
winner of the Most Valuable
Player award. He also was
given the trophies represent-
ing the best rebounding and
defensive efforts.

Maloy also officially receiv
od an All-American plaque
and ring.

Jerry Kroll was named as
the best free throw shooter,
while Wayne Huckel won the
award for the most hustle.

The players gave gifts to
Driesell, assistant coaches

' Terry Holland and Jerry Con-

Le

boy, trainer Tom Couch, and

‘number one fan" Colonel
Frederick Outlaw. .
Sportscaster Bill Currie

gave a brief speech honoring
Driese!ll and citing his ac-
complishments and contrihu-
tions to Charlotte, and a rep-
resentative of the Wildcat
Club gave tribute to Driesell
for his work with Daviason
basketball.

Graff, and Tim Bynum will

Iq the pole vault, the shot put
and the discus throw. In the
relay races, the Wildcats will
have no two-mile relay team.
This race, which consists of
four $80 legs, will probabty
be the least-entered event be-
ceuse small track teams go
not have four 680 men,

In last year's win, Davitd-
son took four first places.

The hopes of another Da-
vidson triumph depend on
certain track tearm members,

Sophomore Rick Lyon,
feeshman Tammy Richattd-
son. and junior Whit Morrow
avtll each. run in three relay
races.

Freshman Ray Swetenburg
and senlors Greg Cox and
Tany Orsborn will head the
Wildeat effort in the [eld
events. Swotenburg holds the
school record for the triple
jump. Cox took first place in
the long. jump in last yeur’s
relays, and Orsborn is the
school high jump record hold-
er, Davidson will sorely miss
sophomore. Steve  Kirley,
their only weight man, who
has been a surprising per-
former in the shot put and
discus this season.

Going into the relays, Dav-
idson's record stands at two
wins and two losses, as the
meet scheduled earlier this
week with High Point and
Pembroke was rained out.

The next meet for the track
team after the Relays will
be Tuesday. when Davidson
plays host to Furman and
High Point.

Spring Squads Preparing,
Looking Toward Future

“It's what's up front that
counts.”

With that philosophy in
mind, Davidson spring sports
are heading into the meat of
their schedules, trying to for-
get past experiences. There
was good reason for forgct-
fulness, too, with only the
tennis and rugby teams
breaking even in contests
this past week.

The basebalt team will per:
haps be the busiest in the
next few days. The ‘Cats
huve a double-header on the
road with East Carolina to-
morrow, and play five games
next week in the space of
only five days.

Stevens savs that the team
is trying to cofrect many of
the mental mistakes it has
been making in, these games.
