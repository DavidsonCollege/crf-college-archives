The Davidsanian

College May Order Cuts

In Slater Food Service

By DOUG BROWN

Assist. Managing Editor
Due to financial problems,
Davidson is corisidering cut-
ting back its subsidy of the
food service next year. It is
estimated that the college
will put 40,000 dollars into
the food service this year.

The Slater food service is
represented on campus by
Klaus G. Kleeburg, who is
manager .of, the cafeteria
“L have no statement,” Klee-
burg said when questioned
about plans for next year,
He felt plans are still in the
negotiation stage, and _ it
would be improper for
to comment on them at this
time.

Vice President of Finance
and Development C. David
Cornell,. during a- meeting

with students concerning the
finances of Davidson, said,
“The food service -is con-
stantly under review. We
evaluate the operation to see
if the best job is being done.
We are open to suggestions.”

President Samuel R. Spen-
cer, Jr. commented, *‘No col-
loges are satisfied with their
food service entirely.”

Officials of the college
claimed that the food ser-
vice problem is not an easy
one, citing the small volume
and the modest facilities. It
is felt that the rise in board

fees from 525 to 575 dollars
next year will be of some
aid.

it is estimated that a_stu-

meals per week. On the ay-
erage, meals cost 68 cénts
for ticketholders, and in the
future they shduld cost 70
cents.

Slater has proposed an end

onds. An end to service dur-
ing holidays, when only about
30 people are setved per

ered, :

type of decision about
next year will be made in
about two weeks. Although

the SGA Food Committee can
make recommendations on
what action the College
should take concerning Slat-
er, the ultimate decision lies
with the administration.

There is an _ observable
amount of loneliness here,

psychologist.

emphasized that
Suggestions are’ just
tentative ones and subject to
discussion and change.

“The Governance Commit- ,
tee will try to work out the
details of a proposal and
publish the results sometime
in May for student and fac-
ulty discussion,’ said Lin-
gle. ‘This committee will not
recommend anything to the
Board of Trustees that does
not have broad student sup:
port.’

Lingle said he hoped that
the final proposal could be
brought before the board in
a special meeting June 16, so
that the 8ystem would be in
operation at the beginning of
the 1971-72 academic year.

The Governance Commit
tee was formed a year ago
by the trustees to look at the
entire system of governance
and make recommendations
to the board.

The committee divided the
area into two parts: student
conduct and interrelations of
governing bodies. Lingle
hopes that the first area will
be ‘completed this spring.
The committee will then be-
gin work on_ interrelation-
ships of the governing bod-
ies.

The Governance Commit-
tce is composed of one mem-
ber of the Board of Trustees,
‘Phillips; one member of the
administration, Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan: one faculty

member, Professor of
losophy George L. Aber
nethy; the President of the
Student Body, Danny Clod-
felter; and Committee Chair-
man Lingle. .,

“Trying to. effectively
amend the present court
Structure would be extreme-
ly difficult,’ said Lingle. ‘

“There are basic problems
built into the whole system.

“From a procedural stand-
point the committee is think-
ing in terms of wiping the
slate clean and starting from
scratch,’ he said,

Assistant Professor of Ger-
man Hansford Epes, Jr. who

is a, member of the Student’

Life Committee, said he was
very encouraged by the di-
rection the Governance Com-
mittee is meving.

“The information they pre-
Sented seems very realistic
and seems to call for appro-
priate participation, especial
ly from students,"’ he said.

Free Beer

Saturday from 11 a.m.-6
p.m. the Union Social Coun-
cil will sponsor a beer party
and concert on the hill over
the baseball field. Featured
groups will be Mass Préduc-
tion, the Blue Sky Commit-
tee (which features Davidson
students), Partly Cloudy, and
the Southern Folk Festival.

There will be about, 20
kegs of free beer and soft
drinks provided by the Un-
ion,

It makes for lonely.

on ‘@ words themselves,"’

Part of the problem lies
with inhibitions, Hall stated,
“The student—for that mat-
ter, all of us inhibits — his
positive feelings more than
his negative feelings. We can
shoot someone the . finger
more easily than we can say,
‘I like you.’ "

“Coeducation would bring
out aspects of a person that
would not otherwise devel-
op. The students here feel
this lack a great oy he
declared.

“Coeducation wouldn't de-
stroy all the misconceptions
and myths about the oppo-
site sex,’’ Hall continued.
“People would still. try to
impress each other with how
cool they are.

“Part of the problem is
that some students are try-
ing to be something instead
of being themselves. They

‘think that they have to be

cool all the time. They're
afraid to say that they are
great at some things, kind of
average at others, and just
lousy at some,”’ he said.

“People are pretty frank in
looking for who they are,
though,"’ Hall said.

Hall thinks that Davidson
students are too cynical.
“They look around, and they
see that there are a lot of
things wrong with people
over 25,

“They see that there are
a lot of people who are not
doing what they want to do,
and ask themselves, ‘Do I
have to be a phony like older
people?’ Unfortunately, that
is as far as their questioning
goes."’

“The trouble is,’’ Hall con-
tinued, ‘‘that it’s really too
easy to critize the older
generation. Tife is so damn
complex that young people
can’t understand all the pres-
sures on older people and
the older people wouldn't
judge young people. I know
it won't happen; T guess peo-
ple like to see things in black
and white.”’

Hall's contract will not be
renewed next year because
of the financial problems ut
the college.
