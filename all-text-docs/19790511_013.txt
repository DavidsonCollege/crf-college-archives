The theft was discovered
around 6:40 a.m. by a patrolling
town policeman, who said it
probably happened between 3
a.m. and 6 a.m. “The thing that
bothers me here is the time

points to his’ professor’s atti-
tudes as part of the problem.

“They had. a very naive
notion of what the job market
was like,” Wellnitz said of his
former professors. “Their atti-
tude was one of ‘the best people
will always be able to get jobs.’
This is a fairly prevalent atti-
tude among the somewhat pres-
tigious graduate schools. What

people don’t realize is that there

are entirely too many PhD’s
being produced in the sciences.”

Durden

(Gregg Strader)

Indeed, Durden stressed the

importance of a diverse staff,

one active in and representative
of the Davidson community.
She wants to avoid a staff
composed of just ‘‘Davidsonian
nerds,” writers whose activities
within the Davidson com-
munity begin and end with the
newspaper. She feels that active
writers are more knowledgeabie
of the community. _

Describing the present staff,
she said, ‘‘Reporters have to be
smart and thoughtful people,
and I see that they (the present
staffers) are. The reason that
their articles are not always

. thoughtful is one of tradition.”

She added that with better
editorial leadership past’ prac-
tices can be changed.

Durden also mentioned better
planning as a means of improv-

- ing the quality of the Davidson-

ian. ‘Time is a big factor,”’ she
said. ‘The sooner an article can
be done, the sooner you (the
editors) can do what needs to be
be done with it.” Durden has
already outlined two of her
editorials for the fall. She also
plans to use the summer to
