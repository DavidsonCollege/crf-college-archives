Sunday Night, Dee. 12

Malcolm Williamson Is
Chosen To Be Reader

from Waynesville, N. C., has been
selected from a group of 15 candi-
dates to be the reader for Sunday

night’s annual Christmas Vesper

service,

The service is co-sponsored by
the Davidson College YMCA and
the Davidson College Music De-
partment and will be held in the
College Church this Sunday night,
December 12, at 7:30 o'clock.

The service is a combination of
selected Scripture readings and
music by soloists, the Male Chorus,
the Chapel Choir, the Chamber Or-
chestra, and the Brass Ensemble.

As in the past the Brass En-
semble of the Concert Band will
play from one of the nearby build-
ings for a period preceding the
start of the service in the sanctu-

ary.

The Vesper prelude, ‘“Christ-
mas Concerto” by Corelli, will be
played by the Chamber Orchestra.
Harold Frantz, formerly of the mu-
sic faculty at Davidson and now a
professor of music at Montreat
College, will be the guest organ-
ist for the service.

Following the processional, “O
Come All Ye Faithful,” Leighton
Green, president of the YMCA,
will give the invocation, after
which a Litany of Thanksgiving
will be given responsively.

The Christmas Story will be pre-
sented in three divisions: The
Prophecy, The Birth, and The
Adoration, with appropriate Scrip-
ture readings by Reader Malcolm.

by the Male Chorus and Chapel
Choir. The numbers will include

The congregation will join in
singing Christmas carols, and the
recessional will be “Hark the Her-
ald Angels Sing.” President John
R. Cunningham will pronounce the
benediction, concluded with a
choral response. The Postlude will
mark the close of the service.

YMCA committee in charge of ar-
rangements is Dickie Davis, assist-
ed by Blake Brinkerhoff. Directors
of the music are Donald Plott,
Kenneth Moore, and John Satter-

music faculty.

The Chamber Orchestra includes
among its members five students,
Richard Morrow, Bob Beall, Jim

Friends of Davidson are invited
to the service, but because of the
limited amount of seating space,
it is suggested that all who wish to
attend come earlier than usual.

TWO BY NORTH CAROLINIANS

Library Gets New Books

Among the new extra-curricu-
lar books to be found in the David-
son College library are two by na-
tive sons of North Carolina. One of
these is Goodbye, My Lady, one of
the last works of James Street,
whose recent death saddened mil-
lions who loved his work.

Street has fashioned this story
of a boy, an old man, and a dog
into a tale of individual beauty
and rare excitement. The boy,
who lives on the edge of a swamp,
with Uncle Jesse, finds a dog in
the swamp. He grows to love the
dog and decides to try to make
him his own. His success and the
rewards of the victory in joy,
achievement and maturity, make
up the core of the story.

Review Cutting Rule

The faculty executive commit-
tee’s recent resolution concerning
student absence from reviews re-
ceived an important revision this
week.

In a meeting Tuesday afternoon,
the faculty voted to tevise last
month’s ruling designed to elimi-
nate promiscuous cutting of re-
views.

The revised resolution stands:
Faculty members are not required
or expected to give make-up re-
views to students whose sbsence
from e review has not been ex-
cused under present, normal, ab-
sence regulations of the College.
(By the word review, the faculty
understands a written test of ap-
proximately one hour’s length, as-
signed a reasonable length of time
before its administration.)

Academic penalties for an un-
excused failure to teke a review
are left to the determination and
diseretion of the instructor.

The original resolution, which
developed into a controversial is-
sue among professors and students
alike, read:

1. Faculty members are not per-
mitted to give make-up reviews to
students who have cut for reasons
other than (a) Sickness in Infirm-
ary (b) Participation in College-
sponsored affairs (not student dan-
ces and the like) (c) Emergencies.

2. The professor shall record ze-
ro for those missed reviews not
specifically covered by (a), (b), and
(c) above.

3. EXCEPTION: The professor,
at his discretion, may recommend
to the Dean of Students and to the
Executive Committee that a stu-
dent be permitted to take a make-
up review, even though the “cut”
is not covered by (a), (b), and (c)
in 1.

Spanish Club Holds

\Chrisimas Meeting

Le Navided (Christmas to Eng-
lish speaking folk) was the logical
subject of the combined meeting
of Sigma Delta Pi and the Spanish
Club Wednesday night, December
8

Archie Joyner recited a broken-
‘Spanish version of “The Night Be-
fore Christmas.” Members were
then given an opportunity to test
their knowledge of Spanish Christ-
mas terms. Bill Carrell won first
prize with a near-perfect paper.

Familiar Christmas carols with
somewhat unfamiliar words were
sung by the club. The final event
of the evening was the breaking
of the pinata (a bag filled with
sweets and nuts) by Tom Dobbins.

Cumming Elected To
SAMLA Section Office

At the November 26-27 meeting
of the South Atlantic Modern
Language Association, which met
in Columbia, South Carolina, Pro-
fessor W. P. Cumming of the Eng-
lish Department of Davidson Col-
lege, was elected chairman of the
English Sections of SALMA for the
coming year, 1954-55.

Also at the SALMA meeting,
Professor Watts of the French De-
partment, read a paper on Voltaire.

characterization of fiction to the;neighborhood is stacked with old

first factual biography of Gen.
Thomas J. Jackson. His book, They
Calted Him Stonewall, is a stirring
narrative of men and war.

Filled with character portraits
which seem to come to life before
the reader’s eyes, this book uncov-
ers many hitherto unknown facts

Mr. Davis attended Duke Univer-
sity and is a graduate of the Uni-
versity of North Carolina. He is a

My Brother's Keeper

My Brother's Keeper by Marcia
Davenport is a fascinating novel
which will hold the reader spell-
bound. It is the story of two old
men, whose house, in a run-down

papers, 14 old pianos, an auto chas-
sis, and piles of junk yard glean-
ings.

When one of the brothers is
found dead of starvation and the
other is missing, a puzzle is
brought to the attention of the
public. Why should two men, well-
educated and from a good family,
live and die here among this squa-
lor?

A Fable

William Faulkner’s A Fable is
set on a battlefield in the spring
of 1918. Here the Passion of Christ
is re-enacted by a corporal in the
French army, who is determined to
stop the war.

This book contains some of the
most powerful scenes ever con-
ceived by Faulkner. It is sure to
be a subject of discussion and de-
bate for a long time.

MOREHEAD POLL:

Most Students Favor
Greater Subsidization

At the suggestion of members of
the D Club and ODK and due to
highly speculative rumors around
the campus, the question of ath-
letic subsidization was chosen by
the Davidsonian as the subject for
this month’s student opinion poll.

This -poll was conducted by 20
reporters from all four classes;
gathered representative views from
52 percent (433) of the student
body; and covered all six dormi-
tories, the Village, Carolina Inn,
and six town residences.

Question 1. Are you in favor of

the proposed complete non-subsidi. |

zation athletic policy of the admin-
istration? VES: 28—4.4 percent.

This question pertained to the
suggested formation of a league of
colleges, such as W&L, Sewanee,
Davidson, and Centre, whose
athletic programs would be com-
pletely non-subsidized

Question 2. Are you in favor of
the present policy of partial sub-
sidization? YES: 144—-33.2 percent.

The word “subsidization” as used
here referred to the $35,000 avail-
able for athletic scholarships in
football ($30,000) and basketball
($5,000) covering four years be-
ginning in 1954.

Question 3. Are you in favor of
increased subsidization? VES: 262
—60.4 percent.

It was noted in several instances
that those floors which were pre-

stantially in favor of Question 2
in preference to the other ques-
tions. This was attributed by the
reporters to our 6-3 record in foot-
ball this year. Opinions varied con-
siderably among the upper three
classes.

Prominent comments and _ rea-
sons given were:

Question 1. The money could be
better spent on the scholarships.
Subsidization, “‘pay for play,” ruins
the essence of sports. If enough
other colleges with good teams
would cooperate in such a league,
it would be beneficial to Davidson,
putting scholarship in its proper
place—“first"—and raising school
spirit. .

Question 2. Davidson had a good
team (football) with sufficient sub-
sidization this year; if it were elim-
inated, school spirit would drop
and publicity would be substantial-
ly decreased; if increased, it would
drop scholastic standing and make
Davidson a “commercial college.”
At. present, non-scholarship ath-
letes have a chance to participate
in inter-collegiate ball. Some in
this category showed a general in-
difference toward the subject.

Question 3. Outstanding athletic
teams do as much or more to raise
the standards and reputation of a
college as outstanding scholastic
standings — in the long run we
would acquire better students both
athletically and academically with
stronger athletic teams.

Increased subsidization would
enable more deserving men to
come to Davidson, increase our
prestige and reputation in colle-
giate circles, build school spirit
within the student body, enable
Davidson to compete on an equal
basis with all teams in the South-
ern Conference, and develop stu-
dent pride in the alma mater.

Some felt that the “minor”
‘sports should receive subsidization
as well as the “major” sports.

This poll was taken by: J. Trotti,
A. Cone, L. W. McIntosh, B. Gal-
lier, C. Cridlebaugh, B. Fraley, G
Robertson, A. Myers, E. Moore, D
Carmichael, B. Sharp, W. Harris,
H. Brockmann, B. Beall, B. Daniel,
L. Carter, S. Wallace, J. Ballenger,
S. Ferguson, and S. Mendenhall.

Faculty Reviews New
Student Constitution

Since early October a Student
Council committee headed by Per-
rin Anderson has been hard at
work on a very comprehensive re-
vision of the entire Student Body
Constitution. The new Constitution
will be presented to the students,
article by article, for ratification
soon after the end of mid-term
exams.

At the present time, the propos-
als are being studied by a faculty
committee consisting of Profes-
sors Pietenpol, Beaty, Ostwalt,
Schenck, and Spencer. When their
work is completed, the articles will
be voted on by the Student Coun-
cil and then by the student body.

The purpose of this: thorough
renovation is to make a Constitu-
tion which will be more acceptable
to the students than the present
document; in Anderson's words,
“To make the Constitution repre-
sentative of student opinion and
one which the students will have
faith in and will want to be govern-
ed by.”

Proposed Changes

Almost all the articles of the

present Constitution have been

Spencers To Conduct
1955 European Tour

Dr. and Mrs. Spencer announce
that-they will act as chaperones for
the Southern Colleges Tour of
Europe next summer. This is the
same tour which was conducted
last summer by Mr. and Mrs. D.
Grier Martin.

The tour, sponsored by the
Brownell Travel Bureau, is re-
stricted to college students and re-
cent college graduates.

From Quebec, the group will sail
to France on the S. S. Homerie, the
flagship of the Home Lines, and
then visit Italy, Switzerland, Ger-
many, Holland, Belgium, and Eng-
land. Travel on the continent will
be by private motorcoach, and
Brownell representatives will ac-
company the group through each
country visited.

The tour will sail June 13 and
registration for it will close in
January. Anyone interested in fur-
ther details should see Dr. Spen-
cer.

Red Cross Collects
209 Pints in Drive

A total of 209 pints of whole
blood was received during the Da-
vidson College Blood Drive Tues-
day and Wednesday, December 7
and 8.

Co-Chairmen Bob Stogner, Aus-
tin Strand and John Buxton were
disappointed at the turnout of Da-
vidson students. Strand attributed
probable indirect causes of the
poor response to confusion over
the blood releases which were
mailed to all parents during Octo-
ber. Delay in return of releases
forced postponement of the initial
drive. Consequently this put the
drive during Intramural Wrestling
Program and conflicted with the
grapplers participating. Then too,
there was no incentive from fra-
ternities desiring one hundred per-
cent donations. -

Scabbard and Blade representa-
tive Stogner emphasized the ur-
gent need for blood even today un-
der peace time conditions. Consid-
ering the size of the Davidson com-
munity, 65 pints used last year pre-
sents a definite need for blood in

this area. Stogner added that there |

are a considerable number of vet-
erans receiving blood regularly
from the Red Cross donations, and
in cases of emergency the bank in
Charlotte stands ready to supply
necessary quotas to disaster areas.

Blood collected in the Mobile
Unit will be transferred to the
Mecklenburg County Blood Bank
where it is distributed free of
charge by the Red Cross.

The Fall Drive in 1953 sponsor-
ed by ODK and IFC netted a to-
tal of 405 pints. One senior was
publicly recognized as a new mem-
ber of the Gallon Club, having con-
tributed 8 pints during the Col-
lege drives.

Mr. and Mrs. T. F. Staley
Establish Scholarships

The Dr. and Mrs. Thomas F. Sta-
ley Memorial Scholarship Fund has
recently been established for the
aid of ministerial candidates here
at Davidson. .

The initial gift of $33,000 was
made to the Fund by Mr. and Mrs.
T. F. Staley of Rye, N. Y., in mem-
ory of Mr. Staley's parents. It is
planned that the Fund will even-
tually provide scholarships for at
least two members of each of the
four classes at Davidson at all
times.

The scholarships will be award-
ed in the same manner as the vari-
ous Honor Scholarships; that is, to
students judged worthy on the ba-

ing that they must intend to enter
the ministry after graduation.

Mr. and Mrs. Staley are natives
of Bristol, Tennessee, where Mr.
Staley’s father was a prominent
physician. His mother, the late
Mrs. Staley, was a niece of R. J.
Reynolds and William N. Reynolds
of Winston-Salem.

Mr. Staley is now head of the
Wall Street stock firm of Reynolds
and Co.; he is an alumnus of Da-
vidson of the class of 1925 and has
had an active interest in the insti-
tution ever since.

As a student, he was a star on
the basketball and tennis teams
and was a member of the ¥MCA
cabinet. His son, Thomas F. Staley,
