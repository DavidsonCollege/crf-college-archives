We are Humes — Humes is Life.

Humanities is the science of
life, the psychology of evolution,
the economics of religion, and the
philosophy of art. It is the interdis-
ciplinary study of every single as-
pect of what makes us who we are.
Itis arecord of who weare, what we
want, and how that has changed

since we first put stylus to papyrus.

The fact that it is a story of male
subjugation of women (according
to Dennis Seavers), or a white het-
erosexual man’s history (ala Kristen
Richardson), is irrelevant, because
that is historically what humanity
has been. Some would argue that
we haven’t changed much, but at
least the concepts of enlightenment
and open-mindedness are now
planted firmly in our minds. Even
the worst misogynist, the biggest
homophobe, and the most blatant
racist must accept the existence of
contrary ways of thinking.

The development of a Humani-
ties curriculum is primarily respon-
sible for this evolution of thought.
As Pascal writes in the “humanities
approved” Selections from the
Thoughts, “It is doubtless an evil to
be full of faults;,but is still a greater
one to be full of them and to refuse
to recognize them.” At least today
we have the capacity to recognize
our faults. There would be no labels
for such people if opposite opinions
did not exist. In the same manner
that evil defines good (and vice
versa), ignorant opinions define

enlightened ones.

An attack on the humanities
program along the lines of sexism
or racism is both illogical and va-
pid. What it stems from is not Mr.
Seavers’ or Ms. Richardson’s de-
sire to expose what they see as an
ill-founded program for the evil that
itis. Rather, they are merely doing
what ninety-nine percent of
Davidson students do when con-
fronted with the iniquities of those
around them: they criticize by what-

we are merely continuing the great
tale of humanity. I am exhausted
every week from reading opinions
by people who use any available
soapbox to spout off about some
issue they have adopted. Check the
application of your opinion to the
issue you are commenting on. Is it
valid?

Humanities’ goal is to reward
clear thinking, writing, and speak-
ing. The accomplishment of this
goal is the issue, not whether or not

the discussion groups. It falls apart
because most students in the pro-
gram approach it with the wrong
mentality. Throughout the course
of the four semesters, we are ex-
posed to the greatest minds behind
the Western Tradition. Butare they?
That is precisely the question all
Humanities students should be en-
couraged to ask themselves. It is
not the professors’ job to spoon-
feed us the reasons why Mondrian
was arevolutionary painter, or why

ever meager
means available.
They take the
easy way out,

We are exposed to the greatest minds behind the
Western Tradition. But are they? That is

ties that make Hu- had ever

manities at Davidson such a unique
and thought-provoking class, they
bite at its edges like two rabid mon-
keys. They pass on their disease
with every breath: the rabies of im-
potent pessimism hidden under the
guise of critical analysis.

The ironic part is that there is
no.counter-argument for their cri-
tique. We cannot journey back in
time to convince the ancients that
what they were preserving for all
time would be thought of as a “white
man’s history.” We can learn from
what they have left us, study it inthe
light of modern “enlightenment,”
and attemptto take the next step, for

the morality of a male-dominated
society from over one thousand
years ago is being foisted upon cur-
rent Humes students. It can’t be. I
refuse to believe that I just lucked

outand got four professors that chal- -

lenged me to think, write, and speak
about the evolution of our own so-
ciety and its ideology, while 100-
some students each semester wal-
lowed in a cesspool of professors
who didn’t challenge them.

It is a ridiculous waste of time
and ink. Humanities at Davidson
does not fall apart because of the
material, the professors, or even
because of the group dynamics of

wanted to be spoon-fed, we
wouldn’t have come to Davidson.
A friend of mine, currently on-leave,
put it in perfect perspective: “The
difference between Davidson and
[nameless, faceless, state school],
is that there, my professors give me
the answers, and I regurgitate them
likea good boy. At Davidson, we’re
given a semester to figure out ex-
actly what’s important: to the pro-
fessor, to the student, and to the
subject at hand.”” Toward Humes,
this statement is even more valid.
Humanities here offers a prime
opportunity to study the greatest
thinkers, artists, and leaders of the

past. The argument that Humes
jettisons depth for breadth is acom-
plete misconception Entire courses
can be taught on each author in the
course. If someone interests you
that much, then by all means delve
deeper. Who’s to say that just be-:
cause Humanities schedules one
discussion session for Descartes,
that we cannot do some indepen-
dent studying on our own time?

Oh, wait. I forgot about the
five papers, three reviews, the GRE,
the MCAT, the LSAT, and next
year’s finals to take every night.
Here’s a myth exploded: the
workload here isn’t that bad. You
might have more work to do here
than anywhere else that your friends
go, but there are still twenty-four
hours in each day. Idon’t get twenty-
five just to write this article. The
key lies in having definable priori-.
ties and time-management skills.
My mom once said, “It’s funny, but
you always have time to get done
what you need to get done.”

Don’t waste your time criticiz-
ing everything, complaining about
all the work you have. Go do some-
thing. Make something. Produce.
Use your “gifted” minds to do some-
thing other than trying to build your-
self up by tearing down everything
around you. Humanities works ac-
cording to its mission statement for
those who let it work. Humanities
is like life: you only get out of it
what you put in.

Last Monday, I asked my room-
mate to read me two articles from
the Davidsonian that were bashing
my: fellow sports editor, Michael
Kruse. The pieces left me angry,
and, in anger, I immediately turned
on my computer and replied. The
two articles, by David Kaul and
Wes Roach, upset me because they
seemed two angst-ridden pieces that
were trotting a personal distaste for
Kruse into the Opinions section.

But here is the really funny

' thing. In multiple conversations I
have had this week, many different
people have, with equanimity and
thought, expressed a concern for
the way the Davidsonian has cov-
ered sports for the last year and a
half. Ihave listened to these people,
and I have begun to re-focus my
views on the purpose of the sports
page. On the other hand, the small-
minded attacks of Kaul and Roach
did nothing except make me defen-
sive. Without these other people, I
would not have considered chang-
ing anything about the paper (see
article on page 13).

Both articles referred to a piece
that Kruse had written a week be-
fore on Marshall Tyler’s heroics
during the Wildcat baseball team’s
sweep of Marshall. Tyler singled in
the winning run, his first hit in col-
lege baseball, after entering the

game as a pinch hitter on the first
day of the set. The next day his two-
run homer in the ninth gave the
Wildcats another win.

Some of their key points: 1) It
was mentioned that Tyler was the
back-up goalie on the men’s soccer
team; 2) Tyler was referred to as “a
seldom used outfielder” and an “un-
likely hero;” 3) Kruse is just jealous
of how cool Tyler is. First, Tyler is
the back-up goalie on the soccer
team. Next year, he will be vying
with fellow sophomore Brad Stroble
for the starting job, but Matt Hill
was the starter last year. Complain-
ing because Kruse said he was the
back-up goalie seems ridiculous.
Pointing this out doesn’t demean
Tyler in anyway, it simply shows
his versatility as an athlete.

In addition, Tyler has played
on the Davidson college baseball
team for two seasons, an accom-
plishment which no one, including
Kruse, has discounted. However,
last year he had only five at-bats
and he was 0-13 at the plate this
year before the Marshall series. It
seems that 18 at-bats in a year anda
half would qualify someone as sel-
dom used. That is in no way an
insult to Tyler’s skill as an athlete or
his worth as a person. That is a
simple statement of fact. Before
that single, Tyler had played very

little. Because Tyler was hitless on
the season, he would not have been
the mostlikely candidate for a game-
winning hit. On a team filled with
big batsmen like Brad Edwards,
Gus Quattlebaum, and Luke

Goodwin, Tyler would not have.

been a likely candidate for heroics
in crunch time. At least not before
that Saturday. Again, this does not
slight Tyler in any form. It is sim-
ply stating a fact.

Heroes are made in a moment,
moments like Tyler’s on that Satur-
day, but expectations are built over
time. Inthe Marshall series, Tyler’s
performance surpassed the expec-
tations most fans had built from his
previously infrequent perfor-
mances. It is no coincidence that
Tyler’s playing time has drastically
increased since that series, and if he
was to show himself as a hero again,
this time it would not be unlikely.
With those games, he established
himself as a late-inning savior and
showed his considerable talents with
the bat. Now we can all expect it in
the future. Saying that Kruse’ s state-
ments somehow slighted Tyler is
ludicrous. He simply stated facts.
Before that game Tyler undoubt-
edly was a “seldom used outfielder”
and in the series he was an “unlikely
hero.” This does not mean that
Kruse was somehow belittling his

talent, if anything he was praising
Tyler. He was saying Tyler stepped
into a crucial point of a college
baseball game, and saved the day
with his first-ever hit. Then he
turned around and one-upped him-
self the next day. Kruse was mar-

- velling at the wonderful improb-

ability of those events.

Chattanooga wasn’t upset a
month ago when they were still
battling in the NCAA tournament
and every paper in the country men-
tioned them as a “Cinderella story.”
That’s because they were a
Cinderella story. Nobody picked
them to go that far, and rightfully
so. They had never done it before.
That doesn’t mean they weren’t
good at basketball or that saying
“Chattanooga has never made the
Sweet Sixteen” would be insulting.

I don’t know David Kaul, and I
will not even begin to speak to his
motives. But I do know that. Wes
Roach has a vision for the
Davidsonian sports page that
clashes with Michael Kruse’s ideas.
I couldn’t have cared less about
this, until Roach decided to take
that differing vision and publicize it
in his poorly-thought out and angst-
ridden article last week.

I don’t remember Kruse ever
writing anything about how he
thought he was better than every-

one else because he could sit on the
sideline with his notebook and al-
most single-handedly cover major
Davidson sports witha greater depth
and discernment than any student
has ever attempted to do before.
Yet Roach finds it necessary to say
that Tyler “is cooler than you
[Kruse] could ever dream of be-
ing.” What this has to do with his
previous argument eludes me, ex-
cept that it shows Roach’s infantile
inability to separate Michael
Kruse’s words from Michael Kruse
the person. In resorting to such
feeble-minded and sophomoric ar-
guments like “Tyler is cooler than
you are,” Roach only underscores
his anger and makes himself sound
ridiculous in the process.

If Wes Roach or David Kaul
don’t like the way Michael Kruse
writes, that’s fine with me. If they
disagree with what he chooses to
cover or the manner in which he
covers it, that’s also fine. If they
thoughtfully introduce an intelli-
gent point, then they might even
sway some of Kruse’s future deci-
sions. However, I suggest that in-
stead of simply bitching about the
coverage, they try getting involved
in the Davidsonian and writing
some sports articles themselves.
