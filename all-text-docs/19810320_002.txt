NRC reopens licensing hearings

McGuire nuclear plant may be dangerous

By JIM POLLARD
Staff Correspondent

New doubts about the safety
of the McGuire Nuclear Plant
caused the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC). to reopen
McGuire’s licensing hearings on
February 24. ~ ~—_-

Last summer, the anti-
McGuire Carolina Environmen-
tal Study Group (CESG)
brought new evidence concer-
ning the Three Mile Island
nuclear accident of 1979 before
the NRC.

The safety of: McGuire’s one-
inch-thick containment shell
came into question because
hydrogen gas formed in the
.Three Mile Island ‘accident ex-
ploded with a force of 28 pounds
per square inch (psi). McGuire’s
one inch thick steel shell is
designed to withstand a pres-
sure of only 15 psi.

CESG President Jesse Riley

- said in the February 22 Char-

lotte Observer, ‘‘The potential
physically exists for that con-
tainment to blow skyhigh.’’ The
federal licensing panel will not
allow Riley to testify because

<2 danger,
detonation will occur, I can’t .

they do not consider him to be
an expert on hydrogen explo-
sion questions.

Duke officials insist that the

- structure is actually able to

withstand a force of 65%
pounds per square inch.

Duke lawyers said that the
installation of an ignitor system
which would burn hydrogen as
it formed would prevent an
explosive build up for the gas.
Dr. Marshall Berman of Sandia

National Laboratories in New |

Mexico questioned the effec-
tiveness of such ignitor sys-
tems, however. He said in the
March 11 Qbserver, ‘‘Person-
ally I feel there is a problem, a
.I can’t say a

say it won’t.”” The NRC will
present eight witnesses who
disagree with Berman’s testi-
mony according to the March 11
article.

Duke officials added that
safety procedures make a
hydrogen related accident im-
possible. Duke’s licensing man-
ager, Ken Canaday, said in the
February 22 Observer, ‘‘We

don’t believe there is any real
possibility of hydrogen being
generated. . .We believe the
licensing of operators will en-
sure that the reactor is always
flooded with water.”’

In the Three Mile Island
accident, operator error allowed
the water coolant to escape from
the reactor, causing the reactor
to overheat and to evolve the
explosive hydrogen.

The CESG asked the licen-
sing panel to subpoena profes-
sors from Davidson and UNCC
in order to delineate the risks of
operator error. CESG lawyer
Shelley Blum said that David-
son. professors are reluctant to
testify because Davidson re-|
ceives funds from the Duke
Endowment, which is primarily
supported by Duke Power Com-
pany. College Psychology Pro-
fessors John Kello, John Brock-
way, and Edward Palmer re-
ceived subpoenas and testified
on March 5.

The hearings take plaée in the
Charlotte public library at 310
N. Tryon Street.

Three seniors receive graduate fellowships

By JEFF HOLLAND
Staff Writer

Seniors Rob Campany, Hugh
Crenshaw, and David Rhodes
have won prestigious graduate
fellowships.

Campany, a philosophy ma-
for from Abingdon, Virginia,
won a Luce Fellowship to fund a
professional apprenticeship in
Asia. Campany also received a
Fullbright Fellowship, which he
had to decline.

Crenshaw was one of 70
recipients of a Thomas J.
Watson Scholarship, which he
will use to pay for research in
the South Pacific. Crenshaw is a
biology major from Durham,
North Carolina.

Rhodes, an economics major
from Decatur, Georgia, won a
four year Justin Potter Medical
Scholarship to Vanderbilt Med-
ical School.

0 'ampany
Campany and 14 other recip-
ients chosen ‘by the Henry Luce
Foundation ‘will work for a year
in the Far East towards the goal
of improving American under-
standing of Asia. This is the

- first year the Foundation invit-
'. ed Davidson to nominate candi-
‘ dates for the fellowship.

“The program ‘sets you up

- with. what you want to do,”
_ Campany said. ‘‘If-you’re inter- .

ested in law, they'll put you in a

_ law office.”” Campany will spend .

the year teaching philosophy in

a uhiversity in Taiwan or Hong |

Kong, preférably Taiwan. He is

also interested: in making con-

tact with some of the Christian
missions there.

“The program is more exper-
iential than academic,” Cam-
pany said. ‘‘I’ll be placed in a
university there because I’m
interested in college teaching
and would like to be a college
professor.”

Hugh Crenshaw
Although he is not - familiar
with the language, Campany
said he will be studying Chinese
over the summer. Upon his
return he plans to go either to
divinity school or to graduate
school in philosophy.

Crenshaw was one of four
Davidson students chosen by
the Davidson Selection Com-
‘mittee to submit proposals to
the Watson Foundation. The

- Watson Fellowship gives win-

ners the opportunity to go

anywhere in the world to study

the subject of their choice.
Crenshaw will travel to the
South Pacific and study coral
reef ecology at Neiwetok Atoll
in the Marshall islands, New
Guinea, and the Great Barrier
Reef in Australia. He will work
with researchers in the area,

David Rhodes

and conduct individual research
to study zooplankton. ‘‘By con-
centrating on zooplankton, I
hope to fan out from there and
learn about coral reef systems,’”’
Crenshaw said.

Rhodes’ Potter Scholarship is
worth $10,000 a year and is
awarded annually to four stud-
ents from the Southeast. The
four finalists were chosen from
12 semi-finalists who were flown
to Nashville for interviews,
tours and other programs, Rho-
des said. Rhodes is not sure
what he will be studying at
Vanderbilt but said he is lean-
ing towards emergency medi-
cine.

A number of fellowships are
available to seniors and inter-
ested persons should contact
the Dean of Students’ office or
Philosophy Professor Lance
Stell, chairman of the Davidson
Graduate Fellowship Commit-
tee. Stell advises rising seniors
to start developing proposals
for these programs ‘‘very

”

soon.
