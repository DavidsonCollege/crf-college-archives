Phi. Society.

The subject debated in the Phi So-
ciety Saturday night was: Resolved,
‘That the United States should make
good its guarantee to the wheat farmers.
' Chalmers, Hart and Calhoun support-
ed the affirmative by showing that the
government was honor bound to make
the guarantee goud, and that it is only
just that she should do it.

The negative, which was upheld by
Foscue, Kornegay and Wool, claimed
that since the government had repudiated
other war contracts and as the wheat
farmers were already rich, the govern-
ment would be justified in breaking its
guarantee to the wheat farmers.

The decision committee decided two
to one that the affirmative put forward
the best debate.

Following the debate J. F. Clark gave
a declamation on Concentration in the
United States; C. C. Long then ably de-
livered a declamation on ‘The ‘T'raitor’s
Death Bed.

The hall next enjoyed (?) an extem-
poraneous debate, “Resolved, That Da-
vidson should establish a swimming pool
as a memorial for the boys who have
fallen in the war.” T. R. Alexander
upheld the affirmative and J. A. Potcat
the negative. The affirmative was de-
clared the winner.

Eu. Society.

came off Saturday night instead of nine
who were to take part.

CHAMPIONSHIP FORM DIS-
PLAYED ON ATHLETIC FIELD

While Coach Fetzer's nine were grap-
pling with the mighty machine of Phila-
delphia, another great battle was being
staged on Sprunt field, in the town cf
Davidson, N.C. Said battle was be-
tween the class of ‘21 and the class of
‘22, or between the Sophs and Fresh.
In order that the laws of the campus
may not be violated. this battle must be
entitled “a baseball game," and consid-
ered as such in this discussion.

With *’Puck-and-done-it” Miller in
the box and “Pep” Patterson behind the
bat, the Fresh presented such a formid-
able combination that the Sophs were
unable to break it up. “Goober” Fishel
and Poteat, for the Sophs, did good
work, but failed to receive the proper
support from their teammates.

After nine rounds, an armistice was
signed in order that a winner might be
declared, if such were possible. The
adding machine on which the score was
kept totalled as follows: Fresh 13.
Sophs 5. The machine on which the
errors were kept became hot from fast
working, and in the fifth inning refused
to operate any further. ‘The umpire thus
announced his decision in favor of the

Fresh.

PROMISING PROSPECT FOR
SUPPLY OF DOCTORS

On last Friday night the Aesculapian
Club held its annual initiation of new
members. “The ceremony was held in
the new gym and was very impressive.
We understand that most of the initiate:
have recovered at this writing. Dr.
Harold D. Clayberg was present: and
ably assisted in some of the finer points
of the proceedings. After the new men
became full fledged followers of Aescu
lapius the club abandoned business and
proceeded to enjoy an informal feed that
had been prepared for them.

son and Drake upheld the affirmative
against J. R. Boulware and O. M. Dug-
gar, of the negative. As a whole the
debate was poor, though some good
points were brought out. The affirma-
tive argued that the government should
keep its promise and that to abandon the
guaranty would be unfair to the farm-
ers, while the negative contended that
it would show partiality to one section of
the country, which is against American
principles. The affirmative won. The
program closed with a declamation by

G. M. Atkinson.
