COACH YOUNGER SIGNS

(Continued from page 1)
| ginning of the past season it was said that

Davidson had no material for a football
|team but with the men willing to work and
|the coaches working them hard, a team was
turned out that won a widespread reputation.
The Wildcats went into games with odds
against them, but when they came out they
had the respect of everyone. The football
boys won seven games, lost two by 6-0 mar-
gins, and tied one 10-10. The Wildcat goal
line was crossed only twice during the sea-
son, and one of these on a blocked punt.

The basketball team made a creditable
showing the past season and has played a
fast game with heads up. The baseball
team has been playing with the jinx this
season and has had hard luck, but it has
finally broken the losing streak. The play-
ers are ever-anxious and Coach Monk lacks
reserve pitchers to rely upon.

Coach Monk has become a part of David-
son and along with Coach Tilson constitutes
the main gear of the Wildcat machine,
These two men have probably done more for
athletics at Davidson than any other per-

sons. The student body feels that as long
as these men are here that a clean and splen-

did athletic policy will be followed out.

DAVIDSON NINE DEFEATS
GUILFORD

(Continued from page 1)

Laird went well until the begin-
ning of the eighth, when bunched hits caused
him to retire in favor of Wells.

Smithdeal, McBane and C. Smith played
the better game for Guilford, especially at
the bat,Smithdeal getting a home run and
two singles out of five times at bat. Vance,
Covington and Simpson hit best for David-
son, and between them they secured 10 of
Davidson's 17 hits. Vanve hit a home run
with the bases“ full in the second inning,
white Covington hit a triple.
