Afternoon is Given Over to Rigid
Inspection and Review of
Battalion
The climax in the

military activities of

the year of the Davidson R. O. T. C. unit
is reached this week with a varied = pro-
gram of maneuvers and parades by~ the

entire battalion. The activities of the week
are confined for the most part to two days,
Monday and Wednesday, on both of which
days Davidson is honored by visits of dis-
tinguished army and state officials.

On Monday afternoon, April 4th., a del-
egation of visitors to the inspection of the
Charlotte National Guards came to
Davidson to observe a review put by
the Davidson R. O. T. C. unit. Among this
group of visitors were several army notables
who head fhe military organizations of
North Carolina and the fourth ee area
of which this unit of the R. O. C. is a
part.‘ The review was the only ee
made of the battalion by the visitors.

Today the R, O. T. C. unit is being in-
spected by the War Department Board of
Officers. /This inspection is to determine
whether or not Davidson will be designated
in the War Department orders and pub-
lications as one of the distinguished colleges.
Davidson won the distinguished rating last
year and if this honor. is earned again the
insignia won last year will become per-
manent. Davidson is the only North Caro-
lina school that has ever earned this distinc-
tion.
