Frat Sports Managers Meet;
Decide to Continue Football

Serious injuries austained by several players in interfraternity football games recently
caused Coach Heath Whittle, supervisor of the interfraternity sports program to call a special
meeting Thursday afternoon of al! fraternity sports managers to diseuss the situation. Coach
Whittle pointed out that three times as many injuries have been incurred in the interfrater-
nity football program as in the regular tackle game played by the varsity and frosh teams.

After discussing possible solu.
tions to the situation, the decision
of the group was to play the re-
mainder of the scheduled games
this season with a special plea to
team members to cut down on un-
necessary roughness prevalent in

A Christian's Stand
In Wartime Argued
At IRC-YMCA Panel

A panel discussion on “Faith that
Lives in a World at War” was held
Tuesday night in Phi Hall. Mem-
bers of the panel were Dr. E. O.
Guerrant, Professor of- Political
Science; Dr. Bernard Boyd, Pro-
fessor of Old Testament at UNC;
Rev. J. C. Auman, Pastor of the
Forest. Hills Methodist Church in
Concord; and Dieter Oberndoeffer,
a German student.

Opening the discussion with a
short talk, Dr. Boyd defended a
position of Christian Pacifism. He
indicated that a person choosing
such a course would invite serious
criticism and probably see no im.
mediate result of his stand. Al.
though he would be met by apparent
failure, Dr. Boyd claimed “he would
fail the same way Christ failed.”

Continuing this theme of a
Christian’s stand in time of war,
Dr. Guerrant suggested two cours-
es of action that a Christian might
follow in relation to his government.
First, he should make every at-
tempt to secure the election of
Christian officials in that govern.
ment. In the second place, he should
strive to support those governments
which put into effect Christian poli-
cies and in general fostered the
growth of Christianity.

Rey. Auman interceded with the
thought that if the causes of war
and in particular the economic caus-
es were ferreted out and remedied,
there would be no wars. This would
eliminate a necessity for making
a difficult choice between church
and state during a national emer.
gency.

To clarify the position of the
church on this matter, Dieter
Oberndoeffer read a portion of a
Luthern Church statement in re-
gard to Germany's Re-armament
Program. He concluded, by assert-
ing that no war is justified in Gods
eye and that the church should re-
main neutral in all circumstances.

Several questions were posed by
both students and faculty who par-
ticipated in the discussion. These
were answered either partially or
fully by the panel and other indivi.
duals present.

Phi Hall was crowded almost to
overflowing and this forum was
judged by the panel members to
be one of the most successful and
rewarding meetings of its kind held
here in recent years.

McLean Directs
Clothing Drive

Beaver Club members sponsored J..

the annual old clothes drive this
week. This year’s collection will go
to needy persons in Europe and Ko-
rea.

Under direction of Mac McLean,
Beaver Club president, boxes were
placed in each dormitory for the
clothes and room to room canvass.
ing was carried out Tuesday and
Wednesday nights.

Indications at press time were ,

for a successful drive with a large
amount of clothes already collected.

The drive officially ends Friday
night, but those still having old

clothes that they would like to con- |.

tribute may bring them to 310 East.

many of the contests. As Coach
Whittle, supervisor of the interfra-
ternity athletic program, pointed
out, every team seems to “have
it in for the other, instead of play-
ing for the enjoyment of the sport.”

Several proposed solutions in-
cluded changing the game to “tag”
football, issuing equipment and
playing regular six-man (tackle)
football, and limiting the number
of players on a team to seven or
six. However, most of these were
considered too radical to be put
into effect this year. « °

Athletic Director Paul Scott pro-
posed the most popular solution to
the problem. Since, as scems to
be the case, most of the injuries
sustained in the interfraternity game
are the result of vicious downfield
blocking, he suggested that the
rules be altered to restrict blocking
to within five yards of the line of
scrimmage. Mr. Scott's suggestion
was considered by the sports mana
gers to be the most practical, bu’
the general consensus of opinion
was that any change as radical as
that would hurt the attack of every
team if it were to be put into effect
this late in the season. The group
did, however, table Mr. Scott’s sug-
gestion for discussion at a later
date.

ciety recently announced its sche-
dule of films to be shown this
semester. It is as follows: Novem.
ber 10, “Les Miserable,” December
1, “Keys of the Kingdom,” Decem-
ber 15, to be announced later, Jan-
vary 3 “Intolerance,” January 12

on the campus, At present there
are approximately 300 members,
.over 90 percent of whom are stu-
dents.

An effort is being made to ob-

ing of the next film. Two projects
will be used at the showing of
the next movie which, will provide
a continuous program.

Stuart Plummer and Robert Mc-
Clure are the projectionists. Tech.
nical advisor for the society is Pro-
fessor Sellars.

With the purchase of a larger
screen it is hoped that member-
ship to the society can be reopened.

Dr. Bernard Boyd, Former Davidson Bible Protessor,
Returns To Campus; Serves on “Faith In War” Panel

“It’s a crip—lI'm not doing a lick
of work,” smiled Dr. Bernard Boyd,
a former member of the Davidson
Bible Department and who is now
a Professor of Old Testament
Study at the University of North
Carolina. Dr. Boyd returned to Da.
vidson as a panel member in Tues-
day night’s forum on faith in war
time.

He spoke with a degree of re-
lief as he expressed a desire to
acquire additional duties and class-
es. Apparently well satisfied with
his work at Chapel Hill, Dr Boyd
reported that his extra curricular
calendar was also less crowded than
it had been at Davidson.

Teaching two elective classes, Dr.
Boyd is concentrating at the pres-
ent in giving a fundamental know.
ledge of the Bible to his students.

One of these courses is concerned
with the basic Old Testament con-
tent, while the second is an attempt
to illumine certain background ele-
ments relative to the Bible as a
whole.

Of his students, Dr. Boyd laugh-
ingly said, “The majority of students
who enroll in my courses do so
either because they want to learn
or because they think it will be
crip.” Although he finds fewer of
his students than would be sus-
pected. are pre-ministerial, Dr.
Boyd claims he is “rapidly making
converts.” The two classes contain
a total of thirty boys and girls.

“Chapel Hill is a good town,”
he replied when asked to compare
it with Davidson, “though there are
perforce many more differing fac-
tions.” Even thongh he had to sign

“What Happens When We Pray?”
He stressed the value of seeking
a quiet place to be alone and have
a personal talk with God, and ex-
plained that prayer is answered in
many different ways, often so that
we are not able to realize that our
petitions are being granted. This
message sought to answer a ques-
tion which is foremost in the minds
of each of us who sometimes won-
der concerning the value of prayer.

In answering the question “Why
Aren't We Better Christians?”, Dr.
Depp asserted the thought that,
although this is due in part to a
lack of knowledge of just what
Christianity requires of an indivi-
dual, it is more deeply rooted in the
fact that we haven't the courage
to stand up for our Christian ideals.
We dare not be good Christians
because we fear the responsibilities
it places upon us, forgetting or
overlooking the fact that Christ

faced Calvary. To how many of us

:i[today does our Christianity mean
‘}so much?

In his fourth talk of the series,
Dr. Depp challenged his listeners
by asking the question “What Do
You Want?” In attempting to an.
swer this question, the listener was

‘|ted to consider three things above

a loyalty oath, he asserted that he
has yet to discover a Communist
there.

Dr. Boyd's general plans for the
future include accomplishing a more
thorough orientation of his profes-
sorship and stimulating the Tarheels
toward more and varied scholastic
Bible study. .

NOTICE

Tryouts To Be Held
By Forensic Group

Bryan Robinson, president of the
Forensic Council, has announced
the tryouts for the Fall debating.
These tryouts are to be held on
Monday and Tuesday, November
13-14, with emphasis on the speak-
er’s ability to grasp his subpect as
well as exhibiting his speaking
qualities. The tryouts will differ
from actual debating in that the
main speech is to be five minutes
long, the rebuttals to be two and
one half minutes long, and in that
no decisions will be made, The
tryouts will be judged by the facul-
ty committee which is composed oi
Professors Guerrant, Lilly, John.
ston, Griffin, and Tyson.

About thirty-five boys, from Sen.
iors down to Frosh, have shown in-
terest in entering this year's de-
bating and Bryan urged that all who
are interested in trying out and
have not notified him to please do
so as soon as possible. His room
is 108 West. He also reminded
those who are entering the tryouts
of the supply of reference material
available in the library.

The first debate will be held in
approximately two weeks, but only
regulars with previous experience
will compete. At the first tourna-
ment however, which is to be held
in Charlotte beginning November
27, Robinson expects the Council
to enter in full strength.

Faculty Reverses
Earlier Decision

In Called Session

In an interview with The
Davidsonian, Dr. Cunning-
ham revealed that the fa-
culty voted in a called meet-
ing to change the official
Thanksgiving holiday from
Thursday, November 23 to
Saturday. November 25 and
to cancel Vesper Services on
Sunday evening, November

Students taking cuts on Fri-
day before the holiday or on
Monday following the holiday
will be charged with double
cuts.

This change, which has been
the subject of a score of rumors
and scuttlebutt was passed al.
most unanimously by the vot-
ing faculty. Though Thursday
is officially a national holiday,
the faculty agreed that Satur-
day would be a more appropri-
ate holiday under the existing
circumstances. In order that
Thanksgiving Day itself not
pass unheeded, a special student-
faculty service is being planned
in order to give the college an
opportunity to give collective
thanks.

The Honorable Francis Mil-
ler, of Charlottesville, Virginia,
who was to speak at Vespers
on November 26, has been in.
formed of the cancellation and
invited to visit the campus la-
ter in the winter.

Concerning a three-day holi-
day period such as was granted
last year, the president af-
firmed that it could not be re.
peated for a number of reasons.
Several out-of-state parents
contacted the Administration
requesting that they not calen-
dar a three-day period due to
its proximity to Christmas and
the unwanted travel expenses
involved for their sons. In ad-
dition to these and other rea.
sons, the Board of Trustees
has never sanctioned the exten-
sion of a holiday which forced
returning students to travel on
Sunday.

Local Blood Drive
Pleases Chairman

Colonel J. t.. Ballard, chairman of
Davidson Red Cross Blood Drive,
announced that the blood drive last
Thursday exceeded all previous
goals of its kind. Although this
year’s quota was not reached, Col-
onel Ballard was exceedingly
pleased with its results. One of the
reasons was the fact that the date
chosen for the drive by the Red
Cross office conflicted with many
other events in the community,

The drive was conducted in the
basement of the College infirmary.
Those who assisted in the drive
were Red Cross doctors and the
local chairman, Ladies of the town
operated a canteen under the chair-
manship of Mrs. F. W. Fredrickson,
president of a local women’s organi-
zation. Many other people gave
much of their time toward making
the drive a success. O. D. K. was
responsible for much of the publi.
city given to the drive.

The Colonel expressed the desire
for all of us to eat plenty of beef-
steak between now and February
when a similar drive will be held
if the Far East situation continues.
