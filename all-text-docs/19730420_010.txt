Basketball Fur unding Alternatives Cited

(Ed. Note: This is the third
article in the series on Crisis In
Athletics. It will deal with the
aspects of a nationally
prominent basketball program,
what it takes to maintain it, and
what should be done in the
future with regard to the
basketball program at David-
son.)

Athletics are a business en-
terprise for an institution such
as Davidson College. They do,
of course, promote school spirit,
bring students and alumni
closer together, and give the
school a nationally known
reputation.

But at most schools com-
peting in major college sports,
there is a definite business
aspect involved.

Athletics should thus be
treated as such.

It was pointed out in the last
issue of the DAVIDSONIAN
that the basketball program
lost almost as much money as
the football program here. The
figures for these sports are
$140,000 and 160,000, respec-
tively.

It should be noted, however,
that these figures did not in-
clude the money flooded into
football via the Wildcat Fund.
Adding this scholarshiped
amount, the total for football

reaches approximately
$266 ,000.

paring the amounts of $140,000

three years if we cannot con-
tinue to compete successfully
within the national scope,"’ war-

ned Holland. ‘‘We have got to
Maintain our national
prominence if we want to

recruit players of national
calibre.”’

According to Holland, the
basketball program is ‘‘fighting
to maintain national promi-
nence.”’ With the rising costs of
college athletics, this is
becoming increasingly harder.

‘‘Basketball is a_ big
business,"’ said Holland. ‘‘Many
schools are pouring in funds to
their basketball programs that
a few years ago were mediocre

He cited more examples of
schools which were putting in
tremendous allocations for the
support of basketball.

“Clemson, South Carolina,
ECU, Appalachian, Virginia
Tech and William and Mary
have all built new arenas since I
graduated in 1964," he stated.

“Basketball is probably the
major college sport today, in so
far as attendance and interest
are concerned,’’ continued
Holland.

‘“‘Just look at all the people

“I dont like the idea of everyone comparing the
$140,000 figure to $160,000. I really don't think we lost
any money. If they want me to run the program as an
auxiliary enterprise, | would be happy to do it.”

and $160,000 to each other,"’ ex-
plained Head Basketball Coach
Terry Holland. ‘‘You h to
add in the money that comes
through the Wildcat Fund.”’

Holland then went into an ex-
planation for making the above
statement.

“The school does not let us
raise our own money,” he said.
“If they wanted me to do this, I
would be more than happy to do
it.

“T also feel that the $140,000
that was spent on basketball
was not lost. It was the amount
that we were allotted in the
beginning and we used what we
were given,’ he continued.

From talking with Holland, it
becomes quite apparent that
the basketball team could make
it on their own without taking
funds from the college.

This would, however, cause
competition between the Living
Endowment, the Wildcat Fund,
and whatever organized effort
was initiated to raise funds for
the basketball program.

“‘T would be happy to run the
program on a completely
auxiliary basis,’’ said Holland.
‘I think that the program would
have enough potential to do this

Now, considering the es-
tablished reputation that
basketball has at Davidson.

“This will not hold true in

that watched the NCAA Cham-
pionship game between UCLA
and Memphis State,"’ he cited
as an example.

The number of estimated
viewers of the nationally
televised contest was over 38
million, for a new record of
spectators for a sporting event.

The 1974 NCAA Finals,
scheduled for Greensboro, N.C..,
had over 60,000 ticket requests
in more than 20,000 pieces of
mail less than 12 hours after the
first legitimate postmark time
arrived. There were only 8800
seats available in the begin-
ning.

“The 1950's and 60's were the
big decades for college foot-
ball,"’ said Holland. ‘But
basketball has far surpassed it
in the 70's.”

But it does ‘‘take money to
make money,"’ as the old saying
goes.

_Money is a key factor in

building and maintaining a
nationally prominent basket-
ball program.

“If that is what we want at
Davidson, then we are going to
have to put the money into it in
order to get it.’ declared Hol-
land.

It is becoming more and more
apparent that, if Davidson does
not put enough money into the
basketball program, then the

college will be left behind, just
as it was in football.

One of the possibilities for in-
creasing the basketball monies
would be the institution of a
requirement that students and
faculty members purchase
tickets to these contests.

At the present time, students
are given their seats absolutely
free. At the same time they are
given the ‘“‘best seats in the
house."’

Faculty and staff members,
along with their families, are
also admitted free of charge.

At other institutions laying
major college basketball this is
hardly the case.

Take for example the Univer-
sity of Maryland. A sum of $10 is
taken from the activity fee of
each student, which covers the
cost of student tickets to all
home basketball games.

It also grosses $300,000 for the
basketball program. There are
approximately 30,000 students
at Maryland.

Now, adding the money that
would be made if all the people
who are admitted free to David-
son basketball games now were
forced to pay for their tickets,
plus the amounts that could be
made if the students were not
given the $5 and $6 seats,
(unless the students would be
willing to pay for seats of this
nature) and these seats were
sold to season ticket holders, as
well as regular paying spec-
tators, one arrives at a nifty
figure of close to $60,000.

This would significantly
reduce the present costs of the
basketball program.

If, indeed, the college is com-
pletely sold on the idea of a
nationally prominent team,
then it should go after big-name
opponents that would draw
large crowds.

Sports Information Director
Emil Parker estimated UCLA
would come play in the
Charlotte Invitational Tour-
nament for about $25,000.

It seems possible, then, to get
the Bruins and two other
schools to come to Charlotte,
the two nights would almost
certainly be sell-outs.

Estimating that 12,000 tickets
would be sold at about $5
apiece, then the school would
gross about $120,000 for the two
nights.Subtracting expenses of
about $45,000 ( which is probably
very liberal), then Davidson
would net close to $75,000 or
over half of the present budget.

It seems highly possible that,
run as an auxiliary program,
the basketball team could
easily make as much money as
they are losing now and most
likely much more.

The question would then be

raised as to whether or not this
should be done.

Economically it seems to be
very attractive.

As far as spreading the name
of Davidson across the country,
it would keep the program in
the national limelight.

It would also maintain a
program which would leave
open a means of relating the
alumni to the present student
body.

But ultimately it would
present stiff competition with
the Wildcat Club and the Living
Foundation for contributions
which, one way or another, end
up at Davidson College.

Potentially speaking, the
basketball program is the
prime Davidson candidate for
national recognition in
athletics.

It simply reverts back to the
matter of priorities that came
out last week.

If the school wants athletics,
it will have to pay for it.

Holland feels that if ‘‘you
want to compete on a certain
level, then you have to pay the
costs of competition required to
play there.”’

If run correctly, the basket-
ball program could be a real
business success as_ an
auxiliary enterprise. It seems
that this would accomplish the
purpose of athletics at David-
son: to spread the name of the
school and give the alumni a
means of relating to the stu-
dents.

It should be given serious con-
sideration, if not a trial period
of three to five years.

But the time for the move, as
Holland pointed out, is now, not
in three years.

If the change is to be suc-
cessful, it Would demand im-
mediate action.

(Next Week: The fourth ar-
ticle in the series will deal with
the aspects of the minor sports
at Davidson. It will also -in-
vestigate the college's policies
regarding non-subsidized
athletics.)
