most fragile and fugitive thoughts and
adisplay the same, crystal clear, to his
audience.”

After his last Chicago” recital, the
Chicego Herald and) Examiner found
that, “he proved that the orzanist may

exercise his imagination within the limits
of his instrument and-achieve expres
sions of beauty that are characteristic
and that cannot be duplicated -by_ either
the piano or the orchestra.”

Mr. Christian made
with the Chicago, Detroit, Rochester,
and New York Symphonies, New York

High Quality Work

Officials Of Relief Administration
Stress Scholarship Re-
quirement

Students who have FERA work, and
who hope to remain on the payrolls, will
have to step lively from now on, The
school has’ been especially successful in
securing work on various projects for the
great number of applicants for this aid,

In the past two an addi-
tional number of students have received
assignments, swelling the total from the
original maximum of seventy-three to a
number a bit past a hundred,

As Davidson College is allowed only
one thousand ninety-five dollars each
month, every stident may not earn fifteen
dollars, which is the supposed amount,
when over seventy-three are employed.

The following quotation is taken from
a letter ©f the Administration the
“Federal Emergency Relief Administra-
‘ tion dated July 3, 1934:

“The students (given FERA aid) shall
be of good character, and judged by the
usual methods of determining ability em-
ployed by the particular college, shall
possess such ability as to give assurance
that they will do HIGH GRADE
WORK in college.”

In view of this statement, and of the
fact that some of the FERA men here
are failing their work, the local com-
mittee, at a recent meeting, made the
following rulings:

1—A student making a failing grade

E or F considered failing in this

\lthough probably not recognizable by

the above lines, it is, nevertheless, the
Pills Brothers playing at a nine months
engagement in Georgia dormitory to the
loudly expressed discomfort of some and
the enjoyment of others who are more
appreciative of “good harmony”.

The trio is in revlity a second edition
of the Pills Brothers, because of. the
fact that Dave McLain and Billy North-
en, two of the three original members.
were unable to participate this year.

With these two men dropped from the
original roll, it remained for Geddie

P. D. Guerrant, he now has a club almost
as good as the original Pills Brothers.
Evideritly, the brothers are well satis-

fied with their brand of music, since
they broadcast around 11 o'clock in order

harmony.

Needless to sey, however, every music
organization has in its audience “non-
eppreciatives”, who seize every oppor-
tunity which will allow them to demoral-
ize the cause of their discomfort.

Of-course, the Pills Brothers are often
subjected to such an audience. Not in-
