problem, plans to study economics at Oxford
niversity, England.

award on January. The scholarship will cover
expenses for two or three years of study at

Phi Beta Kappa member and 1976 SGA
President, Baskin has “‘enormous energy and
organizational ability,”’ according to Professor of
History Brown Patterson, local advisor for the
Rhodes Scholarship. Baskin, nominated two
years ago, was selected on the basis of interviews,
his application, and transcript from campus,
state and district comittees. Coty Pinckney, ’78,
and Maria Patterson, '79, were also nominated as
semi-finalists, but not selected as Scholars.

Baskin is‘currently at the Yale School of
’ Organization and Management, involved in a
combination business school and public policy
graduate program stressing practical application
and decision-making. At Oxford, Baskin plans to
study theoretical economics, he said, “‘to help me
be a better practitioner.”” Baskin does plan to
return to Yale to complete his M.A. after he
receives a B. Phil. from Oxford is about two
years.

Eventually, Baskin said, “I expect to do a little
of both public administration and business. There
are all sorts of ideas running through my head.

None of them is developed.enough for me to say
‘this is what I want to do.’ ” However, Baskin,

who grew up in Midland, Texas, a heavy oil
production area, hopes to be involved in dealing
with the energy problem. He spent last summer
as an energy consultant to an electrical contrac-
ting company.

“I’m very interested in,—it sounds sort of
corny, I guess—service. I think you can do this
as a businessman, or in government, or in
energy.”

Baskin spent a year after graduating from
college as headmaster and instructor at a
secondary school in Kenya, where he raised
money for an endowment fund to provide new
classrooms, labratories, and opportunities for
more children to attend the school.

.Baskin explained, ‘‘We didn’t have enough
school fees so we had to send kids home who
couldn’t pay.”

He praised Davidson, and said it helped him
“see things from a multitude of perspectives. The
entire Davidson experience was a very rich
experience.’

However, he sees three shortcomings of his
experience at Davidson. He wishes Davidson had
had more non-academic role models, and ex-
plained, ‘‘I really wasn’t seeing anyone I-eould
identify with or emulate as business and political
leaders.”’

He also said he ‘‘didn’t feel.anything at
Davidson was making students come to grips
with what they were going to do after college soon
enough.”

Finally, Baskin feels that ‘‘Davidson’s values
in lots of ways emphasize someone being sharp or
clever. When you leave, people don’t really care if
you're sharp—it’s not enough.”’

Baskin emphasized that he thinks Davidson is
trying to correct these problems.

appropriated, will be a second
special benefit of the recent

Campus Magazine makes debut following month delay

By KENT DYER

Hobart’s Park finally made
its debut on campus Tuesday
night. Co-editors Amanda Hall,
Greg Hankins, and Lyman
Collins-were pleased to see the
magazine out after experiencing
a one-month delay because of
production problems. ~~

The literary magazine was to
have been distributed on De-
cember 13, but techitical pro-
blems with the printer caused
delays and the staff had to
collate and assemble the pages

- by hand.

Collins ‘apologized for the
delay and added that he hepes
to be able to bring out the
Spring issue on schedule.

Hall was very enthusiastic

about student response. “Our.

Hobart’s Park was given as
budget of $1,200 as set by the
Activities Tax Council. Howe-
ver, Hankins feels that, due to
unexpectedly high production
costs, this amount will not be
sufficient to cover this year’s
expenses.

According to Hall, their deci-
sion to use high quality paper
instead of newsprint to make
the magazine more attractive
accounts for the extra expendi-
tures. :

She plans to begin a campus-
wide fund drive early next

- month. -

Collins, however, hastened to
add that the paper “‘desperate-
ly” needs continued community
support. He is now soliciting
new material for the next issue,
slated to appear in early March.

He still plans to print a third

issue, as planned, late in Spring ~
Term.

The staff is presently seeking
a business manager. Collins,
Hall and Hankins urge anyone
interested in the position to
contact them.
