FRESHMEN RIOT

This is a familiar scene of the Class of ‘61 as it engages in one of this year’s water battles.
The riots usually start in front of Belk Dorm. Above the crowd gathers behind Cannon.
Note the boy with a can of water in the upper left. The absence of freshmen hats is ob-

PREDICTS WORLD WAR

Dr. Koo Afraid That
U.S. “Faces Big Problem”

By HOWARD PERSINGER
After a year’s lapse between
visits to the Davidson campus,

Dr. T. Z. Koo, Chinese artist,
sage, prophet, and statesman,
returned again prophesying

World War IIL in 1960.

Many of the Davidson stu-
dents remember Dr: Koo's
Chapel talk last year in which
he stated that by 1960 the in-
dustries of the Communist

world would be far enough ad-

vanced to wage a war on the
free world. :

Once again in an
is quoted as saying that the
technological advances in Rus-
sia’s space satellite and inter-
continental missiles now have
given Russia a big advantage
and that “to save America now
is a pretty big order.”

Dr. Koo stated that the only
hope for peace is disarmament,
and he implied that since Rus-
sia now has the “upper hand,”
this hope is all but bright.

In discussing other topics of
public interest, Dr. Koo
marked that the “Little
situation” has been political-
ly bad for the United States.

Many of the Middle East
countries, whose people ap
proach the same color as the

American Negro, are thrown in)

opposition to the treatment that
the “Negroes are receiving in

“But,” said Dr. Koo, “we who
are on the outside of the Unit-
ed States, do not blame you for
your racial problems, for even
India and China have had simi-
lar problems.

“The important thing is the
making of headway toward a
solution and the dealing with
such problems in a rational
way

“The bad .part about racial)
problems is the emotion which |
is always involved and emotion:
‘is a disturbing element which
must be curbed.”

FORMOSA

When asked about the future
of Formosa, Dr. Koo stated that
“internally Formosa was stable
with a fair degree of prosperi-
ty.

“In relation to the Mainland
it still remains to be seen
whether the Chinese National-
ists will return to the Main-
land as the conquerors or
the conquered.”

Dr. Koo said further that For-
mosa stands as a tremendous
psychological impact to the
free world and to the Commu-
nists in that “it is one of two
centers of anticommunist feel-
ings.”

Students’

Hero Has

Peanuts Is Here At

“Your campus is full of pea-
nuts!”

Now, a declaration like that
coming from a man from Min-
neapolis, could be good or bad
—depending upon whether or
not you were in the peanut
business. But this Minnesotan
wasn’t referring to the kind of
peanuts you eat, He meant lit-
tle folk, youngsters. He calls
them all “peanuts.”

“Why, peanuts are the grand-

Charles M. Sehulz. “All chil-
dren are peanuts, even mine;

they are delightful, lovable,

funny, .
and entirely unpredictable.’

irresistible youngsters,

is the creator of the “Peanuts”
‘comic strip being distributed
\throughout the world by Unit-|

led Feature Syndicate, a strip

which has won phenomenal
| popularity and, for Mr. Schulz, |
‘the 1956 Cartoonist of the Year
| Award of the National Cartoon-|
| ist Society.

Mr. and Mrs. Schulz have four
“peanuts” of their own, “And
there’s no better way to learn
'about children than to live with

them,” Mr. Schulz said.

Since 1950, when the strip
was started, “Peanuts” has gen-
erated a constant flow of fan
mail. There was the young wo-
| man in San Francisco, for exam-
ple, who wrote: “I know you
are going to think this is silly,
but whenever I have occasion to
refer to my hoped-for first born,
I call him Charlie Brown, I will
undoubtedly name him Charlie
‘Brown.” (Charlie Brown is one
of the principal characters in

|“Peanuts.”’)

The lovable little characters
in “Peanuts” have captured the
hearts of American college stu-
dents, too. The editor of the
Whittier College (Calif.) cam-
/pus newspaper wrote: “‘Pea-
| nuts’ is the comic strip of the
leentury.” And from Duke Uni-

versity’s student editor came

Mr. Schulz should know. He the comment: “ ‘Peanuts’ has

won the hearts of Duke stu-
dents.”

A top New York publishing
house thought so much of the
“Peanutian” idea that it put
out a 150-page book which in-
cludes about 300 episodes in
the lives of the “Peanuts.” It

sold in the thousands and
proved so popular that two
more “Peanuts” comic books

have since been published.
Peanuts has now come to Da-
vidson.
