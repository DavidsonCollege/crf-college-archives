Brother From Another Planet: good, but no masterpiece

By FRANK LORD
The posters for Brother From
Another Planet ask; ‘What happens
when a space alien who looks like a

black American lands in Harlem?” If .
you go and see this film you'll find .

out, but you’ll want to ask several
more questions. One of these may be:

“Why is this film a cinema classic?” -

To be perfectly honest, it isn’t. That
isn’t to say, however, that it isn’t a
good film. I did enjoy it. Quite
simply, it is not up the caliber of the
films on the rest of the Cinema Clas-
sics program. Thus far, the Cinema

In Our Pages

Classics program has included works
by Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Ing-
mar Bergman, and Jean-Luc Godard.
Brother From Another Planet simply
does not measure up to the exalted
company with which it stands.

The plot:

An alien, looking like the average
black American, except for his toes,
lands in Harlem. Understandably, he
is confused, by what he sees around
him. He is cared for by a friendly
government official who gets him a

‘him.

about half of the film, it is revealed
thatthe alien has escaped from:slav-
ery irhouter space and is being chased
by twomen who were sent to retrieve
e rest of the film revolves
around the chase to return our hero to
outer space.

One of the most interesting and
perhaps most obvious themes of the
film is the alién’s confusion about the
culture that he encounters.

The people who made this film re-
alized that it is easy to point up the
problems of a culture when you show

it trough ae ‘eyee ors someone that

has no knowledge of it. They use his

confusion to show all of the incon-

gruitics and problems that we have
_ been conditioned to ignore.

This works well at first, but after a
while the methods that they employ
to exploit this idea run much too thin
and, in fact, eventually wind up seem-
ing gimmicky.

The most profound theme of the
film is that of slavery, present in
different forms, in images of drug
addiction or in the references to the
slavery that once existed in our own
country. |

COED DISCRIMINATION? -- "
Although it has been rumored on.

campus that the Admissions Of-
fice is discouraging women from
applying to Davidson, Director of

Admissions H. Edmunds White

claimed that the rumors were
absolutely untrue. “No letter even
intimating such a policy has been
sent out of this office... . We’ve
worked too hard to get coeds. We

certainly don’t want to discourage
any.’

Several coeds have been under
the impression that the college is
sending letters to interested
women informing them that few
females will be admitted next
year. White said that the college
was discouraging transfers of
male students for next year, since
the.college would not be able to
house as many women. are.

HATTIE RETIRES -- Hattie
Borgorman, better known as Hat-

tie of Hattie’s Grill which she has
run since 1944, sold her grill last
week so that she could retire.
When the establishment opened,
selling gasoline, groceries, and
beer like it does now, Davidson
students were notallowed to drink
beer on campus. At that time the
college administration frowned
on any sort of drinking: “I can
remember when boys would be
drinking down here and a profes-

_ sor wouldcome in, the boys would

jump out the windows or hide

5. False. The only cure for
drunkenness is time, the time
that it takes the liver to metabo-
lize the alcohol which has en-
tered the body. The liver usually
requires one hour to remove onc
ounce (or one “drink”) of alco-
hol from the body.

6. True. Food, especially fatty
food, delays the absorption of
alcohol into the blood stream.
Overeating will not compensate
for truly excessive drinking,
however.

7. True. Women taking oral

contraceptives metabolize alco-

hol more.slowly than women not

taking the Pill. They are therefore
more susceptible to alcohol’s ef-
fects, and they are more likely to

remain intoxicated for long peri- .

ods of time.

8. True. When used in respon-
sible and moderate amounts, alco-
hol can be complementary to indi-.
vidual and group activities.

9. True. Three to five minutes
after it is ingested; alcohol can be
found in every cell in the body.

10. True. The best way to pre-
venta hangover is to drink slowly,
sparing your body from the shock
of large doses of alcohol. Eating
helps because it dilutes the alco-

‘time allows the body to me-

holandslows absorption, while
spacing drinks over a period of

tabolize alcohol at a constant
rate.

tie.

Hattie sells about a hundred
cases of beer a week, accounting

for approximately ninety percent .

of her total business. Almost fifty
people, many of them Davidson
students, packed Hattie’s Grill
last Friday night to say goodbye.

COSTS INCREASE -- The to-
tal cost of attending college na-
tionwide, including tuition, room,
board, supplies, transportation,
and personal expenses, has risen
as much as thirteen percent this
fall. The survey, performed by the
College Board’s College Scholar-
ship Service, considered data
* from 3300 colleges and predicts
that students at public colleges
will spend $4338 this year. Stu-
dents at private colleges will pay,

on the average, $7475 this year.
The main rise in costs is attrib-

uted to. higher tuition, which has

riscn an average of twenty percent
this year to $979 at public col-
leges, and risen an average of thir-
tecn percent to $4021 at private
colleges. Room and board fees are

yssey.

The idea of slavery permeates the
film. However, this important idea is
treated with such simplicity that it
seems almost child-like.

As I have said, it is not a bad film,
butneitheris it a great film. If you are
looking for an enjoyable way to spend
a couple of hours then it is ideal.

Do not, however, expect the sort of
sophistication that Kubrick brought
to Davidson with 2001: A Space Od-

bash

up eight percent on a nationwide
average, and other costs are seven
percent higher this year.

SUSPECTS ARRESTED --
Four Davidson teenagers, sus-
pected involvement in a 1980 fire.
which destroyed a Cornelius
shopping center, were arrested by
Mecklenberg County Police over
the summer and charged with
arson. The fire destroyed a West-
ern Auto Store and four other
stores. At the time of the fire,
investigators were uncertain as to
whether or not the fire was the
resultofarson, and listed the cause
as undetermined.

FIVE SICK AFTER BASH --
On October 1, five Davidson stu-
dents were admitted to the infir-
mary after the “Hit Me with Your
Best Shot” party at the Fiji house
the previous evening. One friend
ofa fraternity brother who was
taken to the infirmary asserted:
“We were worried about him; his
breathing seemed shallow.” The
theme of the party allowed stu-
dents to send shots of tequila,
bourbon, and Schnapps to other
students. The shots were deliv-
ered to students by scantily-clad
waitresses who were required to
keép the senders’ identities secret.
