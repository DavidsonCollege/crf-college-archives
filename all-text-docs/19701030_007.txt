SORRENTINO TO CAPTAIN

McGeachy Praises Se

By HOWARD BOYD
Sports Writer

Perhaps the best
man basketball team in Da-
vidson history has begun
practicing for the 1970-71
season. |

According to Coach Neil
McGeachy, this edition of
the Wildkittens has the po-
tential to become the finest
in a long line of fine teams,
due mainly to exceptional
team balance.

“We lack overall height,”

said McGeachy, “but we
have excellent quickness
and people who can run.

We'll stress the running
game and do a lot of pres-
ing.” .

Mike Sorrentino, 6-0) play-
maker from Molloy High
School in New York City
(22-1. last syear), has been
elected team captain.

McGeachy calls him “a
«coach’s dream in the back-
court, better than Dave Mo-
ser. He could be one of the
top guards in the country
with steady improvement.”

Sorrentino. will direct the
attack, and ‘‘can see ‘all’
on the fast break.”

John Falconi, 6-5 high
school all-American and -
first team all-New York

City with a 26-plus average
last year, “is the complete
player’ says McGeachy.
“He is a great shooter,
sound. defensively,” and
compares favorably to Bry-
an Adrian and other top
New York City players.

Another high school all-
American is Steve Gadaire,
6-5, strongboy from North-
boro, Mass. jAll-New Eng-
land and the leading scorer
in _his high school’s history,
Gadaire is ‘“‘real quick in-
side.”

McGeachy will play him

fresh-

at the post in the stack of-
fense he plans -to employ,
hoping to take. advatage of
‘a host of offensive moves”
that Gadaire boasts.

T. J. Pecorak, 6-6 217-
pounder from Fairfax, Va.,
where he was named _ first
team all-Metropolitan (Wash-
ington, D. C.) is an ‘‘excel-
lent ball-handier for his
size, and will complement
our running game,” said
McGeachy.

Pecorak is “an ouftstand-
ing outside ‘shooter and
strong defensively, and will
probably draw the fop_ in-
side defensive assignment.”

Paul 6-6, Wash
ington, made first

school team in the D. C.
area last year. He will he
the team’s tallest starter,
and is described by McGea-
chy as ‘‘a vicious rebound-
er.” Wagner will play the
corner in.the stack.

Three —non-scholarship
players have looked good
and will help tremendously.
6-2, Nate Bowman from
Ridgewood, N. J. ‘‘will ‘be
an outstanding point man
who would start for any
other team,’ according to
McGeachy.

Gordon Glasgow, 6-7, from
San Francisco, has the size
and bulk inside and a soft

touch, and will definitely
see a lot of action.”
Bob Vander Griend, 6-8,

of Bradenton, Florida, ‘’was
one of Florida’s top big men
last year,” and came_ to
Davidson because of its pre-

med program. McGeachy
labeled him the “‘hardest
worker on the feam. He

might start.”

cult.

alumni are frothing -at the
mouth-over the decision.”

Heckard explained — that
none have called him but in

his talks with other alumni
many of the older ones are
very upset.

‘T don't know what the ef-

~ feet- sf. the.-trustees’ decision

will be but I do know. that
it will make our work
tougher,'’ Heckard said.

Heckard@- and. the Wildcat
Cluh: are in the process of
trying to raise $150,000 for
football scholarships before
the first of January.

The. drive was kicked-olf
