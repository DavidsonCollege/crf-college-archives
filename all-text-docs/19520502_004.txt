Draft Deferment |New Magazine
Retest May 22

Major General Lewis B.

Service, today announced an additional Selective Service College
Qualification Test to be held May 22 at 1,000 testing centers
for the benefit of students prevented by illness, emergencies or
some other reason from taking the test on December 13. 1951,

or April 24 of this year.

Officers at National Headquart-
ers said they could not emphasize
too strongly that students who
have an admission ticket for either
the December 13, 1951, or April
24 test which they failed to use on
the assigned date must submit a
new application if they wish to take
the May 22 test. The old admission
ticket, they pointed out, will not
admit a student to the May 22
test. He must make application to
receive a new admission ticket.

Application blanks for the May
22 test may be obtained by students
from the nearest local board. They
do not have to return home to the
local board which has jurisdiction
over them. Application for the May
22 test should be mailed as soon
as possible to the Educational Test-
ing Service, Princeton, New Jersey.
Applications postmarked later than
midnight May 10, will not be ac-
cepted.

To be.eligible to take the Selec-
tive Service College Qualification
Test, an applicant, on the testing
date (1) must be a selective service
registrant ‘who intends to request
deferment as a student; (2) must be
satisfactorily pursuing a full-time
college course—undergraduate or
graduate—leading to a degree; (3)
must not previously have taken the
test. .

The criteria for consideration
for deferment as a student at the
present time is either a score of
70 or better on the Selective Serv-
ice College Qualification Test or

Hershey, director of Selective

class standing among the male
members in the upper half of the
freshman class, upper two thirds
of the sophomore class or upper
three fourths of the junior class.
Seniors accepted for admission to
a graduate school satisfy the
criteria if they are among the upper
half of the male members of their
senior class, or they make a score
of 75 or better.

Students already enrolled in grad-
uate schools may be considered for
deferment so long as they remain
in good standing.

These criteria are guides for the
local boards. The local boards are
under no compulsion to follow
them, but any local board classi-
fication is subject to appeal. The
appeal must be filed in writing with
the local board within 10 days after
the local board mails sa notice of
classification.

General Hershey has urged all
eligible students to take the test
so they will have scores in their
files when the local boards reopen
their cases to determine whether or
not they meet the criteria for de-
ferment as students during the next
academic year. ‘

General Hershey also has re-
peatedly stressed that no deferment
is an exemption. “A deferment is a
delay or postponement,” he said,
“and in no way cancels the duty
of the registrant to meet his ob-
ligations.”

Board and the perennial good

judgement of the Davidson student body. there seems little
danger of the system constitating the first wedge in open politics
on the campus. But it is a system in which the unexpected is al-
ways ‘to be expected when men are given free reign with an
audience, must be continually under control, particularly in these

formative years.

Band Goes Outside
For Spring Music

The concert band, under the di-
rection of Kenneth R. Moore, will
present two open air concerts dur-
ing the next two weeks. The fea-
ture soloist of the first concert
will be Grier Williams, first

time” from George Gershwin's folk
opera, “Porgy and Bess.”

This latest form of band enter-
tainment will be staged at the
south side of Chambers Building
between the library and the science
building on May 6thand May 13th.

To Exploit
Campus Field

Collge Life, something new in
the magazine field—a national col-
legiate magazine—will make its
first appearance in October. The
bimonthly publication will feature
articles by professional writers and
experts on.such topics as job op-
portunities, vacations, fellowships,
dating problems and clothes.

In addition it will seek origimal
photographs, poems, short stories,
feature articles and drawings from
gifted college students.

With a potential audience of
aver two million, College Life
will be distributed via sub-
scription and newsstand sales.
The magazine has openings at
present for campus repe to
serve as combination subscrip~
tion salesmen, correspondents
and talent scouts.

Reps will receive good pay for
performing all three functions.

Students interested in applying
for the campus rep positions should
write College Life at 17S Fifth Ave-
nue, New York, 10, N. Y., at once.

They should have et least one
year of college remaining. Appli-
cants should list major courses they
have taken and extra curricular ex-
perience. Previous sales experience
and writing ability are preferred
but not necessary.

Job Outlook Seen
As Very Good For
Graduating Class

The job outlook for new college
graduates this year is excellent.
Our economy is operating at ex-
tremely high levels and is expand-
ing, and that expansion is expected
to continue and intensify during the
rest of 1952 and 1953. Record em-
ployment levels are being reached
nearly every month. Unemployment
is extremely low and is expected to
edge downward even further.

Defense production and employ-
ment have been rising steadly for
many months and are scheduled to
expand rapidly until the end of
1953. After that time defense out-
put will remain on a high plateau
for a number. of months.

Production and employment
for civilian use have been
edging downward in recent
months and a further decline
may be anticipated during much
of thig year, During 1953, how-
ever, employment leveis in this
segment of the economy are ex-
pected to climb upward until
they have more than recovered
the losses of 195$2.

Graduates secking information on
expanding industries or sections of
the country need to remember this
basic fact: most of the jobs taken
by this year’s college graduates will
be, as usual, those which have been
vacated by other workers.

Deaths and retirements at the top
of the occupational ladder create
the largest number of openings at
the bottom. It follows that most of
the openings will occur in the large
industries and the areas where there
are now the heaviest concentrations
of employment.

MOOSE HAS ADDED...
(Continued From Page One)

Italy in the following year.
In addition to this year in Europe
in 1949, Mr. Moose has travelled
widely through New Mexico, Mexi-
co, and Guatemala, spending the
winter of 1948 in Mexico and re-
trrning in the summer of 1951 to
Mexico and Guatemala to observe
the work of the great Mexican
muralists, Diego Rivera, Jose
Orozco and David Siqueriros.
Many paintings by Mr. Moose
are owned in private collec-
tions, but they are also repre-
eented in art museums in such
widely separated areas as The

Art Museum in Colchester,

England; The Museum of

Tacs, New Mexico; The Art

Museum of Norfolk, Viriginia;

and the Mint Museum in Char-

lotte.

Because of his ability and ex-
perience, Mr. Moose has been able
to make many improvements in the
fine arts department during his one
year bere.

In his concern for wider student
understanding and appreciation of
art, especially contemporary “mod-
ern art,” he has benefitted not only
his class but the entire college and
community by regular exhibitions
of paintings in the Chambers lobby.

The firet exhibition last fall
was a collection of realistic
landscapes, mostly mountain
scenes, borrowed from the art
museum of History.

The second exhibiton included
tealistic oil portraits and land-
scapes by the Charlotte artists,
Dayrel! and Katherine Kortheurer
and Paul Bartlett.

The third exhibition was a col-
fection of watercolors of. rural
scenes. The fourth showing ex-
hibited the paintings of about 10
students in Mr, Moose’s fine arts
class. This exhibition was invited
to Charlotte, where it has been
showing in the Mint Museum dur-
ing April. The last exhibiton shown
during Fine Arts Week is the work
of two prominent North Carolina
artists, Kachergis and Howell.

These paintings are modern-
istic in approach, as con-
trasted with the other exhibi-
tions which were morse realis-
tic in style.

lt is Mr. Moose’s hope that
these exhibitons will bring more
and better art to Davidson. With
better exhibition space and more
funds for top-notch museum travel-
ling exhibitions, it is thought Da-
vidson College could work toward
the day when its contribution to the
appreciation of art would match its
contribution of fine music in this
area.

In the speeches that were re-
quired of the candidates, there
was a similarity of awareness
of responsibility and a sense
of duty to office that was ex-
pressed by all three.

Hope brought out the marks of
a better annual saying that the
photographs and engravings could
be improved and he would strive
to do so if elected. He said that
his annual would be original, well-
planned, and representative.

Patton, emphasizing new ideas
and originality, illustrated this by
giving a number of proposed
changes, among them that of al-
lowing the decision of the debated
use of uniform coats and ties to be
left in the hands of the student
body.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests
No. 41...THE MAGPIE

H.. a chatterbox himself — outclassed by no one!
But the fancy double-talk of cigarette tests was

too fast for him! He knew —before the garbled -
gobbledygook started—a true test of cigarette
mildness is steady smoking. Millions of smokers
agree — there's a thorough test of cigarette mildness.

It’s the sensible test...the 30-day Camel Mildness
Test, which simply asks you to try Camels as your
steady emoke—on a day-after-day, pack-after-pack
basis. No snap judgments. Once you've tried Camels
in your “T-Zone” (T for Throat, T for Taste),
you'll see why ...

“We know this is not true in all
colleges,” Mrs. Engel said. “But if
it is true in any substantial number
—if it is only partly true—We of
the Conncil believe our democracy
should take warning, and thar we
should do everything we can to
safeguard the priceless tradition of
free exchange of thought and
Opinion in education any threat of
repression from the outside world
or from fear to ‘speak up’ within the
classroom or lecture hall.

“We believe the survival of
American freedom—in school and
out—will depend on the ability of

America’s citizens to thank for
themselves and on tie courage of
those citizens in speaking up for
the things they believe in. This
has been the very core of our na-
tion’s strentgh from its earliest
days.”
