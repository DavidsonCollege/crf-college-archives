CO-OPERATIVE (MPROVE-
MENT

Mr. Nolen brought to many of us in
his public address here last itriday atpzht
the possibilities of the Davidson campus
from a landscape point of view, as we
had never seen them before. Eis lee-
ture was made up largely of a descrip:
tion of landscape beautifying in parks
and other colleges, but his few words
about our eampus and buildings showed
us that a small outlay with careful plan
ning would work wonderful improve-
ments. Davidson men and Davidson
friends will look forward with interest
to a repore of his general plan for im-
provement, and the details also which
he thinks should be effected. Mr. Nolen
laid prime emphasis upon the necessity
of looking far ahead and making .a care-
ful plan which would be carefully fol-
lowed later, although perhaps — slowly.
Only in this way can our already beau-
tiful campus be made more beautiful,
and the future development of the col-
lege be symmetrical and effective, Do
we have a part in this plan? Most |'
assuredly, for the co-operation of every
Davidson man in’ keeping up the en-
thusiasm for improvements, in interest
ing alumni in the new projects and in
keeping the campus we now have clean
and attractive, will mean as much to
Davidson as anything Mr, Nolen is: po-
ing to do for us.

BRAIN AND BRALIEN.

‘Two contests will begin within the
next week which should claim the inter-
est of nearly every man. “The class foot
ball games will soon begin and the pre-
liminaries for the spring debate will com-
mence next Monday. [t is natural to

consider one 2 contest of brawn and the] S. C

other a contest of brain, while truly
brain and brawn play a part in each.
Foot ball brawn is worth little now-a-
days without foot ball brains, and tie
speaker without physical energy and fire
in addition to brain power is equally in-
effective. Fach contest will call forth
a large number of participants, and the
more the better. For now is the time
when a weak player or weak speaker
has a chance to improve. and may win
a laurel that will spur him to still fur-
ther effort.

To the next year Y. M. C. A. officers
who were elected at the last meeting we
offer our heartv congratutations and
earnest wishes that their administration
may be one of success and blessing.

ball victories this week.

ROLLER SKATING.

While no college student has the.
temptation to get out his roller skates
and exercise upon the sidew: alks, yet we.
cannot but voice a protest, in behalf. of
the children in the town: against the;
town law forbidding roller skating, on
the cement walks. In towns and cities.
ten times the size of Davidson. cities
well governed in every respect, we have;
often seen. boys and girls skating on
the walks in the residential and even
business sections. At present only the,
small walk in front of the Presbyterian
church is allowed the children for this
purpose, while there are jong. stretches
of cement in the ends of the town on
which pedestrains are seldom seen, andi
where such an innocent and enjoyable!
pastime would bring pleasure to dozens. ;
If interruption of passers-by is made the
excuse, a far more justifiable law would |
be one forbidding students to run to the
train because they might knock down’
somebody! We hope that the rown au
thorities will soon revoke this rule, and
grant the children the jov of skating for |
; 1 Ettle more than the distance of ten
ect.
