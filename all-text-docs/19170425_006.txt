be chosen.

J. W. Clark was picked by many to
win, but he was slightly off on his put-
ting, due to the fact that the greens were
smoother than those here. He holds the
record for that course, having. won it
when he was a resident of Greensboro.
Wright, of the University of Georgia,
won the consolation match from Swear-
ingen, of the University of Virginia.

Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, of Davidson,
who conceived the plan of an intercol-
legiate tournament, presided over the
luncheon Saturday. He was elected
chairman of the Executive Committee of
the Southern Intercollegiate Golf Asso-
ciation, as it is officially known. The
officers elected for the coming year. are’
President, Clark (Davidson); Vice
President, Swearingen (Virginia) ; Sec
retary and Treasurer, Grandin (North
Carolina). There were ten contestants
representing four institutions. It is
probable that there would have been
more if war had not interfered. It was
decided to meet in Greensboro next year.
two days before the Virginia-Carolina
baseball game, and to play the finals the
morning of the game.

A dance was given in honor of the
visitors Saturday night, and the prizes
were presented at this occasion. The
delegates were handsomely entertained.
