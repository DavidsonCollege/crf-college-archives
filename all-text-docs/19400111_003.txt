Question

fe) His : Week

Without ‘a doubt the leading topic
of discussion in campus “bull ses-
sions” (with the possible exception
of exams) is the coming Mid-Wint-
ers Dance Set. The main question
is in regard to the music, which is
to’ be furnished by Bob Chester
and his orchestra. Many students
seem to have been hoping for one
of three top “name” bands. Here
are their reactions to the question:
“What do you think of Bob Chest-
er and his orchestra for the Mid-
Winter Dance Set?”

Claude Hackney, Sophomore:

Since the distinctive style of
Glenn Miller has won over music
lovers of both. sweet and swing,

the selection of a band whose mu-
sic is modeled after his should be

numerous recordings of Bob Chest-
er and his orchestra, I feel certain

his novel arrangements of

when Chester has gained a_ top
ranking berth, we may be proud
to say that Bob Chester played
for the Davidson Mid-Winters of
1940,

Jim McDonald, Junior:

I think we are lucky to get such
a fine band for the price of the
dances. All it lacks an impres-
sive name. It plays fine arrange-
ments, both sweet and swing, and
plenty of them. Personally, I would
rather get a kick from a fine young
than be bored to tears with
slurping saxes and electric guitars
just so I could go around bragging
that we had Lombardo or Sammy
Kay.

Neal Scott, Senior:

band

Since the Pan-Hellenic Council,
through no fault of their own, was
unable after exhaustive efforts to
procure a top flight name band,
I think they could have made no
better than Bob Chester.
Chester’s orchestra is certainly one
of the coming bands of the nation.
His style is similar to Glepn Mil-
ler's, which should assure’ him suc-

choice

cess on the Davidson campus.
Kem Wilson, Sophomore: :
Bob Chester is about as good a
band as we could ask for. From the
general trend of opinion, I gather
that Glenn Miller and Tommy Dor-
sey are the-favorites. Bob
a lot like Glenn Miller and also has
a style somewhat like T. Dorsey.
Since we can't get them, why not
Chester? I think he will live up
to his present reputation of the
“new sensation of the nation,” pos-
sibly—taking.Glenn Miller's. place
by next year.
Tom Crighton, Senior:

sounds

Although we are not having the
top name in an orchestra, we have
an imitation of the smooth
style of a great band at- a rea-
sonable price. This music should
give’ us four fine Mid-Winters
dances, but let's hope enough
money is made to _haye Glenn Mil-
ler himself for our last set.

George Coates, Senior:

I heartily approve of the selection
of Bob Chester to play for Mid-
Winters. Although he hasn’t the
name as yet, he has an up-and-
coming band that offers excellent
music at the price Davidson can
afford to pay. His style is very
much like Glenn Miller's, which
should appeal to practically all of
the students. If this set is success-
ful, maybe the Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil can secure a name band for one
of the sets in the spring.

Rey. J. J: Murray, D.D., of
Lexington, Va., was the speak-
er at Davidson’s Sunday night

on the subject of the \World

summer in Amsterdam.

The object of this conference, ac-
cording to Dr. Murray, was to have
all over the

by which it js possible to live the

Dr. Murray gave a description of
the main assembly hall of the Con-

to catch his eye was a large ban-

Harmony Felt

According to -Dr Murray, the
outward mark of this Conference
Was that these young people had
everything in the world. to separ-

mark Was one of harmony and

fellowship. Christian fellowship was
emphasized, and the m iking of long
speeches

Was de-emphasized, their

place being taken by small study
groups, :

The delegates were divided into

of which studied, the Bible and one,
