Football Hangovers

After several weeks of preliminary
practice under the tutlege of Coach Hen-
geveld, the basketball squad went under
the direction of head Coach Younger the
first of the week. Due to the fact that
only four letter men, Captain Anderson,
Harrison, Simpson and Wilson, are in
school, the ball tossers must undergo a
stiff training period to get in shape for
the opening contest of the season with
the Salisbury “Y", aggregation on the
night of December 18th

Last winter, with small amount of
material out for the cage team, Coach
Younger managed to whip the men into
good enough form to down many strong
Southern teams. But the team of this
season will sadly miss the presence of ex-

a

Captain Laird, Litch Huie and several
strong substitutes who graduated last
spring. A number of potential crack

shots and excellent floor men were un-
covered during the class series of this
fall and several should land berths on
the first varsity team. :

Especially notable in this line are Me-
Cauley and R. G. Calhoun of the cham-
pionship Junior class team, The former
was in many Ways the most consistent
player in the series and from his place at
running guard was a thorn in the side of
many opposing forwards. The crack
shooting of Calhoun throughout the-en-
tire fall, placed him far to the front in
points scored. He landed a place on the
varsity squad during the last part of the
past season by virtue of the excellent
performance he gave in several of the
Cow-Boy games.

Coach Mattox has had an opportunity
to look over the material for the fresh-
man team. Among he men who are
showing good form and should give any
others a race for their money are. Mc-
Gavock, Pritchett, Mauze, Brohard.
From all appearances the material for
this year’s rat team is much better than
that of last winter.

As a fitting tribute for his four years
of diligent service to Davidson, the stu-
dent body presented Coach Tex Tilson
with a charming set of ice-cream bowls
for* his wedding present. Davidson’s
coach was married last Saturday in Roa-
noke, Va., to Miss Virginia Kite. Defi-
nite plans made by the newly married
couple have not been announced,

The wrestling team is making fast
Progress and the interest displayed has
been so great and the number of can-
didates so large that Coach Weems has
heen forced to limit the squad to cer-
tain days of the week for practice
periods. Five letter men, all of different
weights, are being forced to the limit by

subs of Jast year and several men to
whom wrestling is a new game. Plays
for another northern meet are being

made by Manager Davis and it is highly
probable that the Wildcat grapplers will

Wildcat Grapplers
Commence Practice

For one and a half weeks the largest
squad that has ever turnel out, for
wrestling at Davidson College has been
put through light workouts preliminary
to the after Christmas schedule. About
including Fresh-
men, compose this squad, a squad which,
it is believed, because of its promising
outlook, will contribute to the building
of the best team Davidson has yet pro-
duced.

Because of the large number of men

thirty-five candidates,

out, Captain George Weems, coach, plans
to limit the entire squad to certain days
a week for practice so as to give those
of ‘varsity caliber a maximum amount of
practice on remaining days.

The five varsity letter men in school
are Captain Frierson. Manager Davis,
Estridge, Crinkley and Mauldin. Other,

upperclassmen showing up well are Bo-
hannon, Cromartie, Flythe, Garrison,
Hansel, Harper, Harrell, Herriott, Hill
and Vance. The latter is showing up
well in the heavyweight class, as is also
Bohannon, one of whom will try to fill
the shoes of Harry Vance of last year’s
team. |
The Freshmen look especially good,!
dnd it is expected that at least two mem-/
bers of this class will make the college
varsity trip to West Point for the Army
meet, the biggest of the season. Carson,
Hunt and Reynolds are showing up well.
In fact, all show a considerable amount
of promise, and it must be remembered
that the Freshman is furnishing
almost one-half ‘of the entire squad.
Those Freshmen who seem certain of fill-'
ing varsity positions will be singled out
and put to work along with the varsity
prospects of the upper classes. Gar-
rison; Freshman Manager, announces that
it practically certain the. Freshman
team will have a meet with the Carolina
Freshmen there, and, in all probability,
a second meet—this to be staged on the
Hill—will be arranged

The college varsity’s schedule with oth-
er colleges is as follows: |

State—Here, January 15th.

Army—There, February 5th.

Duke—Here, February 13th.
V. P. I.—Here, February 10th (Pend-
ing).

Carolina—Here, February 26th (Pend-
ing).

On the trip North when the West Point
Cadets are met on February 5th another
foe will probably be engaged, either the
team of the East Side New York Y. M.
C. A, or that of the Baltimore Y. M, C. A.
The first meet of the season will be held

_while others were in favor of using them.

|for the fact that the Conference is already

with the Concord Y,.M. C. A. on Jan-
uary .8th there. A second meet with
Concord will be here on January 2tst.
Coach Weems announces that next
week before the Christmas hopidays the
tryouts for different weights will be held.

encounter either a strong Y. M. C. A.
team in Baltimore or one in New York. |

attended a meeting at which seventy-five
coaches representing the entire south
were present. Plans for an organization
to be known as the “Southern Coaches
Association” were perfected. Professor
Wood was a listener-in at the Southern
Conference. Davidson was again placed
on the list of approved college that could
be met by S. I. C. members.

Conference Members and
Seventy-Five Coaches
Coach “Monk” Younger has just returned |
from Jacksonville, Fla., where he attended a |
meeting of Southern coaches. There were |
about 75 coaches present at this meeting, and |
plans for an organization to be known as’ the |
“Southern Coaches Association” were form- ,

ed. A committee, composed of H. B. |

chins, of Lake Wales, Fla., and F. E. Cas- |
tarar, of Atlanta, Ga., was appointed as an»
organization committee to lay the plans of |
the meeting before the Association of South-
ern Football Officials. |

The coaches present expressed themselves |
as in favor of the present custom of studying
the opponent’s plays as is done in scouting. |
They voted that no trophies be given. to}
teams for winning. championships. When |
the question of shifts was brought up, there |
was a difference of opinion. Some were in
favor of abolishing the shifts altogether, |

Prof. W. W. Wood has also just returned
from Jacksonville. Professor Wood. was
there about two days after Coach Younger,
and attended a mecting of the Southern In-
tercollegiate Conference. He reports that
Davidson will not be able to get into .the
Southern because of ‘the fact
that the Conference already has as many
members as it wants, and will not take in any
more at the present time. Davidson’s name
has been before the Conference for several |
years, and very probably would have no}
trouble in getting in at this time, were it not

Basketball has. come to the front again.
Regular daily practice started on Novem-
ber 29th, and the men are now hard at work.
They have been under the efficient tutelage
of “Dutch” Hengeveld and Monk Mattox
while Coach Younger was putting the finish-
ing touches to football and attending a meet-
ing of coaches in Florida. Coach Monk
took charge Monday and will begin whipping
his team into shape.

The letter men who are back this year
ate Captain Anderson, Simpson, Wilson, and |

place on the team are McAuley, R. G. Cal- |
houn, D. M. Calhoun, Hunt, Hudgins, |
Crawford, Gilmour, Ohsiek, Sturdevant, Mc- |
Colgan, and Leftwich. About 15 men make |

up the squad at present.

McAuley, R. G. Calhoun, Hudgins, and |
Sturdevant, besides the letter men, have been |
showing up especially well in practice.

The cagers face a hard schedule this year, |

both in teams played here and those played |

|

away from the Hill. The first: game is |
|

played here on December 18th with Salis- |
bury “Y”. Salisbury is reported to have an |
bers as Flake Laird, last year’s Wildcat cap-
tain, and John Schenk, also a former David- |
son cage star.

Concord “Y” is also reported as having a
strong quintet this season.

A few minor changes have been made in
the schedule since it was last made public, |
the place of one or two games being changed. |

In all probability the Union Theological |
Seminary team will be met here on January |
13th, 14th or 15th, one of-+these three dates, |
and Manager Carroll is negotiating with |
Wofford with regard to a game on January |
18th.

of their respective dormitories. Captains
were appointed also for the collection of
pledges in the various fraternity houses and
from the boys living in town.

The campaign was conducted, as has been
the custom for the past two years, under the
direction of the “Y” cabinet. Plans for the
allotment of the total amount contemplate
the forwarding of slightly more than half of
the funds to Warren Cox, at the Hangchow
Christian College in China, to meet a deficit
in his support of last year; while the re-
mainder was to go to the Edgar Tufts Foun-
dation .for the furtherance of mission work
among the mountain folk of western North
Carolina. Edgar Tufts, ’22, who has suc-
ceeded his father at the head of the Tufts’
orphanage and hospital, in the mountains,
