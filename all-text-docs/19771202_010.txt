Christmas
tradition

CF os

revived

A long-standing Davidson tradi-
tion is being revived.

In an attempt to narrow the
chasm between the students and
faculty, the SGA will cram every
room in the Union with tree-trim-
ming, popcorn and cranberry string-
ing, taffy pulling, Christmas caroling,
apple bobbing and more.

Not since the College’s all-male
days has there been a campus-wide
Christmas party, according to Laura
Michael.

As a member of the SGA Stu-
dent-Faculty Relations Committee’
Michael was given the job of organi-
zing the event.

“This will not be a Union party, it: |

won’t be a DCF party, it won’t be an
SGA party--it will be a College
party,’’she said.

Beginning at 7 pm and probably
lasting until 11 pm, the activities are
planned ‘‘to get the faculty and
students together in.a situation
outside the classroom,‘‘ Michael ex-
plained.

‘‘We really want the faculty to
come and to brign their spouses and
children. We’re going to try to get
their kids to dress up as little elves,”’
she said.

Although many details won’t be
worked out until tomorrow afternoon,
the male chorus and the the women’s
chorus have already agreed to lead the
Christmas caroling.

Michael said the expects a Christ-
mas film will be shown on the big
screen. There may be a crafts fair.

“Everybody likes to have their own
party and that’s fine, but we've tried
to include as many groups as possible
to make this a campus party,’’ she
said.

Egg nog, hot cider, cookies, and
other refreshments will be served. A
local Santa Claus is scheduled to
make an appearance.

Room tonight at 8:30.

Asad Ali Khan, one of the few
living Indians to earn the titleUstador
Master Musician, will stop by David-
son as part of his first American tour.

He is the only person alive to
practice the medieval style on India’s
most ancient classical musical instru-
ment still in use.

Khan is a disciple of a dying art.

Up until the 1920’s the rudra veena,
a long string instrument most easily
distinguished by the ornate resona-
ting globes attached at each end, was
quite popular. Today it has been dis-
placed by the sitars and other instru-
ments.

eighteenth century, atime when they
played before maharajas and not

Tonia Devon.

Southern quilt-makers shown

By Esther Bruce
Staff Writer

Art is where you find it.

For an America which has lost
touch with its country origins, the old
homemade quilts which at one time
graced every corn shuck mattress this
side of the Rio Grande have become
an exotic art form.

Six quilts will be on display in the
Union Lobby until Christmas. They
range from the old fashioned to the
modern abstract.

“I wanted to bring something to |

the Union that more people can relate
to,’”’ said Ginny Newell who organized
the exhibition.

“I don’t think that thay art form
becoming as exciting as any other art
form,’’ she added.

Newell said she was struck with the
idea when looking at a similar show at
Charlotte’s Mint Museum. She was
able to get the names of some
quilt-makers from the museum staff.

She was led to even more artists
when she spoke with the suggested
quilt-makers. The resulting display
represents artists from across the

Southeast. December 10. She suggested that the
Newell said that she hopes the people who attend the fair may be
quilts will compliment the crafts fair ready customers for the quilts.

to be held in the Union on Saturday, Prices range from $175 to $1000.
