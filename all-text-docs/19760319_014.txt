Verlin reflects on

By BILL WINKENWERDER
Staff Writer

Tom Verlin, senior forward for the
Wildcat, basketball team, recently
answered questions in an interview
about his four year career at Davidson
as a basketball player and a student.

Verlin, who came to Davidson from
New York City’s Archbishop Malloy
High School was a highly recruited
prepster. He averaged 18 points a
game for his high school team and
made his decision to play for the
Wildcats after turning down offers
from such as St. Jonns,. Su
Bonaventure, Duke, Tennesse and
Rutgers.

When asked why he decided to
come to Davidson, Verlin recalled, “‘I
fell in love with the people and the
climate in the South. I knew Mike
Sorrentino and Coach Larranaga
(both of whom also played at Arch-
bishop Malloy), and I had heard
about Davidson's good academic
record. The combination of those
factors brought me here.”’

Recounting memories about his
Freshman year, Verlin indicated thavu
the adjustment was difficult initially.
“‘T had a rough time my freshman
year. Trying to keep up with my
schoolwork while playing basketball
was hard. But it wasn’t long before it
began to be fun.”’

During his sophomore season
Verlin played a role as a top reserve
on a team that won 18 games. Tom
felt that the highlight of his career
camé that year in a game against
Wake Forest in which he made a
crucial 3-point play in the closing
seconds of the game to bring home a
Wildcat victory.

When Verlin was asked to describe
his feelings about the last two years,
he hesitated, then lamented, ‘‘extra
bad.’

‘“‘We had the talent. There was no
way we should have lost to teams like
East Carolina, William and Mary,
Richmond, and the Citadel. Except
for the Citadel, the others were better

two years ago than they were this.

”

year.

Verlin then commented on the
differences between Davidson basket-
ball in his first two years, and how it
has been in the past two years. ‘‘We

haven't played as a team in the last
two years. Last year there was too
much individualism on the team, and
this year we went to Gerdy all the
time.”

initely psychological. We would get
five points ahead and not put it away
or we would get five points behind
and start thinking we were going to
lose. However, I’m not sure the effort
was there either.’

One of the observations Verlin
made during the interview concerned
the overall brand of basketball David-
son has played in the last two years.”
‘We didn’t have a style. We didn’t
excell in any one area. We weren't a
good running team, a good defensive
team, or a good shooting team.”

Verlin was brief in discussing his
relationship with the coaches, both
Holland and Brickels, in his Davidson
career, ‘‘We got along pretty well. I
have no ill feelings towards either
man, and I think they probably feel
the same about me.”’

When questioned about the bene-
fits he has derived from his Davidson
educition, Verlin said, ‘‘I got out of it
what I put into it. I didn’t apply
my:«!t here. I never took advantage
of w!.it there is to offer, and I think
that chere is a lot.”’

Concerning plans after graduation,

Tom indicated that although he will
be certified to teach, he hopes to go to
Switzerland to play ball with former
teammate Jim Lowry.

Verlin seemed to have positive
feelings about the future for Davidson
basketball. ‘‘I was encouraged by the
resolution the trustees made recently
on the college’s position on basket-
ball. We have potential here, but the
responsibility rests on them. I hope
they decide to hire a proven big name
coach.”’

When Verlin was asked to sum-
marize his feelings about four years at
Davidson, his response hinted no
bitterness or regret. ‘‘I enjoyed it
overall. I made a lot of great friends
who will be friends for life. I never
would have known those people had I
gone to another school. It’s been the
people that have made this school for
me, not basketball. Emphasize that
please, will you?”’

Cat runners to depend on distance,

By DAVE KELLER
Features Editor

This year’s Wildcat track
team will be hampered by a
lack of sprinters and will rely
on strength and depth in the
distance events and strong
individual performances in the
field events for success in the
upcoming season.

With ten returning letter-
men, the Cats will be aided by
a number of freshmen, partic-
ularly Doug Horn and Ed
Anderson in the distance
races, Carl McPhail in the
hurdles and jumps, Irv Wilson
in the pole vault and Milt
McGurdy in the weight ev-
ents.

Some of the top performers
this spring will be Horn-and
Fred Borch in the miles, Coty
Pinckney and Borch in the
three-mile run, Anderson and
Dick Boehner in the 880 and
Steve Justus in the 440.
Others will include Mark Pos-
tove in the intermediate hur-
dles, McPhail in the high
hurdles and Bill Cole in the
steeplechase. .

Strong performances are ex-
pected from John Standfield
and Eppa Rixey in the high
jump, Ray Berberick in the
javelin, and John Lewis in the
pole vault. Jarry Taylor and
Jeff Diller should be strong in
the hammer, as should Milt

dule, Martin feels most will be
“challenging’’ and said ‘‘most
of our meets will be toss-ups.”’
He also said that he hopes to
field a strong team at the
annual Davidson relays ‘‘be-
cause the competition at the
relays this time will be the

Track Coach Sterling Mar-
tin said that the team has a
“good schedule”’ this year and
that ‘‘barring’serious injuries,
we should have a winning
schedule.’’ He feels that the
team is in good condition now
but cited several early injur-
ies, particularly those of half-
miler Dick Boehner and sprin-
ter Paul Schleiffer.

Martin said that he was
“pleased with the indoor sea-
son, as it is,’ bui added that
indoor meets were primarily
for preparation for the spring.
The Cats split their indoor
season 1-1 this year, losing to
Lynchburg College and beat-
ing Campbell College.

Of the teams on the sche-

best in several years.”

Martin was also pleased
with last fall’s cross country
team. At the cross country
banquet last week, Borch wus
named most valuable player
and Horn next year’s cross
country captain.

‘SPRINTERS PREPARE FOR Saturday’s match with Lynchburg

College in Richardson Stadium.

The track Cats’ first meet is
this Saturday at 1:00 pm on
Whittle Track against Lynch-
burg College. They travel to
Wake Forest to take on Wake
Forest and High Point College
Tuesday.
