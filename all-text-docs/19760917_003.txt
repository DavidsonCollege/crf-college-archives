he said. ‘‘But you can do
superior work on an independ-
ent basis during the first two
years, and it’s worth taking
the risk.’’

Epes cited several possible
reasons for the recommenda-
tion to abandon Extended
Studies.

“There are two major ones,”’
he said. ‘“‘One is the widespread
rumors that the work is shab-
by, which it sometimes is.”’

“The reason we get some
poor projects is that some
people can’t find a course
during’ add-drop and have to
throw something together fast
to make a third course,’’ said
Epes.

““A lot of the criticism is
built on misinformation. I see
the contracts and I know the
projects are good. I make it
open to anyone who wants to
come see the contracts, and in

the last two $ears no one has,”’ .

he said. :

Epes believes the faculty
sponsors of projects do not
exercise enough control over
the students, allowing for poor
or rushed work.

“The second reason is fac-
ulty time,’’ he said. ‘‘They
(faculty members) can say no.

I ask the faculty not to take .

more than two projects, but a
lot of people find it hard to say

no. And some people feel
ethically obligated to carry
more than their load.”

Epes also feels the supposed
cost of the program was
considered as a reason for
termination.

Extended Studies is bud-
geted $2500 a year, and over

half that goes to upperclass-—

men doing research projects,
according to Epes.

‘We used the program to
sell the school and then we axe
the program. We use it in the
catalog to sell Davidson, and
in recruiting,’’ Epes said.

“Tf we did not have the
program we would be placing a
very unfortunate restriction
on our students,” he said.

“One irony of the whole
thing is that we got a substan-
tial grant from Mellon (The
Andrew W. Mellon Founda-
tion) and one of the things
backing up the grant was
funds for summer training for
teachers of Extended Stud-
ies,’’ said Epes.

The Mellon Foundation aw-
arded Davidson a $230,000
grant for increased opportuni-
ties for faculty development .

The funds are to be used to
allow for exchange programs
with other colleges, both on
the student and the faculty
level, for the improvement of
the Honors College and the

the money was not being
collected he referred the Dav-
idsonian to Couch.

Couch stated, ‘‘Students
aren’t being held accountable
for what is stolen,’’ to which
Stone and Martin both agreed.
Martin noted that students
are gone for the summer by
the time all losses are identi-

fied, making collection diffi-

cult.

Blame for the losses in
equipment is leveled at out-
siders and students alike.
Stone responded to the ques-
tion of whether or not this
implicated the honor system
by commenting, ‘“‘With $5,000
worth of equipment stolen last
year, what do you think?

“For the large majority the
system does work but there
are those who chose to outfit
themselves from our sup-
plies.”

fessors teaching Extended
Studies.

$18,000 is to be awarded to
the Extended Studies Prog-
ram, according to Epes. Each
year for three years six indiv-
idual professors will be chosen
to receive grants of $1000
each.

Publications postponed

By ANTHONY EVERMAN
Staff Writer

Davidson College has had
more than its share of prob-
lems with its publications.
Among these troubles, two of
the most notable have flared
up in its not very annual
annual and its tardy literary
magazine.

The history of the Quips and
Cranks has become a subject
of much interest to the David-
son community. As of yet,
neither the 1975 nor the 1976
annuals have been published.
Even so, work has begun on a
third annual which will make
its appearance in 1977.

Due to a “lack of responsi-
bility’’ on the part of the
editor, the annual was not
published during 1975. This
lack can be described as a
failure of the editor to perform
his prescribed functions. At
the time of the deadline little
of the organizational work
required had been completed.

According to Sue McAvoy,
editor of the 1977 annual, ‘‘he
just left town and took most of

the copy and pictures with +f

him.’’ With the passage of
time some vital pieces of
material were lost, making
publication difficult.
Meanwhile, Alumni Direc-
tor Zachary Long took over
production. Since assuming
this position, he has main-
tained that only one stumbling

block remains in the way ot
publication. He claims that
the 1975 annual would be
ready for the presses, ‘‘if the
1975 fraternities and social
organizations would furnish
their pictures.”

The 1976 annual, not to be
confused with the 1975 ann-
ual, will be completed and
distributed to the students
this October. Sue McAvoy
strongly maintained that she
was “‘sure that the 1976 ann-
ual would be distributed on
time.”

Though not as dramatic as
the saga of the Quips and
Cranks, the Miscellany has

had its misfortunes. The Mis-
cellany did produce its sched-
uled two issues last year,
although the second issue is
very late. The second issue is
presently being distributed. It
was due last spring.

According: to Chip Craw-
ford, editor of the Miscellany,
‘“‘the delay was due to some
unfortunate irregularities with
the actual printers in Wash-
ington, D.C.” He added that
‘Moreland Hogan, our type-
setter at Briar Patch Press did
an excellent job and was in no
way responsible for the de-
lay.” Supposedly, this year’s
issues will be coming out on
schedule.
