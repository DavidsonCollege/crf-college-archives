Registrar explains readmission difficulties

By DAVE SCHMIDT
Staff Writer

Most Davidson students at one
time or another contemplate taking
time off from school. The process is
quite simple and those on official
leave seldom have problems being
readmitted, into the college. Students
on official leave are guaranteed a
place when they return. Any diffi-
culties that could arise can be easily
taken care of before the student leaves
the college.

Dr. Richard Burts, Temlitrer.: ex-
plained the reasons for previous
difficulties with the process of read-
mitting students.

“Many students who take time off
are under the misconception that
when they leave, they create a
vacancy that will not be filled until
they return. However, this is not

_encourage people to take time of if-

true. The college attempts to fill every
vacancy, except those for which a
student is guaranteed a spot upon his
return.”

When a student drops out of school
all together, Tony Boon, Admissions
Counselor explains, ‘The best thing
for a student to do before he leaves is
to stop by the Admissions Office and
let us know that they are planning to
leave. If they take the time to do this,
and they seem to have a legitimate
reason for leaving, then they have
little trouble in being readmitted. We

they feel it will help.
What about those students who

guaranteed a spot when they desire to
return. “But if they inform the
Admissions office first, it makes
things much easier for them. The
biggest problem are those students
who suddenly reappear.”’

“We first question them as to their
reasons for leaving, and then about

what benefits they feel they received —

from their experiences. We look at
their past record at Davidson. If they

performed well in the past, they
probably won’t encounter many prob-
lems concerning readmissions. If,

however, the student is considered a

‘high-risk’ student, his chances are
diminished considerably. If he per-

formed poorly in the past, then we
would try to fill his vacancy with a
better student.

Finally, we cohsider how long they
have been gone. If we don’t feel that
the student would fit in the atmos-

phere here, then that diminishes their -

chances for readmission. But this
really is the least of our considera-
tions.

“For those students who did not
previously give us an approximate
date of return, timing is also crucial.
We very rarely have any open spaces”

didn’t stop by the Admissions Office
first? Are their chances of readmis-
sion diminished because of this? Dr.
Burts explained the readmission
policy for these people.

Physicist Price to speak

P. Buford Price, a renowned physi-
cist and Davidson alumnus whose
search for the elementary unit of
magnetism got him a 1975 front-page
story in the New .York Times, will
speak tonight and tomorrow morning.

Price and his associates announced
they had found this unit, called the
magnetic monopole, from experi-
ments they did with detectors carried
aloft by giant balloons. Unusual
tracks left by rapid particles were
detected which at the time Price
believed were the monopoles.

According to Davidson Physics
Professor Locke White, if Price was
correct he will undoubtedly get “he
Nobel Prize for his work. But. -e
Price’s announcement several import-
ant physicists have denied his find-
ings suggesting that the rapid part-
icles might be anti-nuclei from anti-
stars.

“The man has a lot of appeal and
interest for non-scientific folks. The
last time he ‘spoke at Davidson, the
non-scientific people were raving ab-

out what a tascinating account he
gave,” said White.

Price will speak tonight, Thursday,
at 8 pm in the 900 Room on
‘‘Magnetic Monopoles: An Unfin-
ished Scientific Whodunit”’. Friday at
10 am he will speak in the Morrison
Room on his discovery.
