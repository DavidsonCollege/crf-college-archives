MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1994

I am writing in response to Ike
Bailey’s recent editorial, “How
important is the Confederate flag?”
In that editorial, Mr. Bailey writes
that the Confederate flag “reminds
an entire race of people of ... the
worst stage in their history ...” and
that the flying of the Confederate
flag over South Carolina “shows
an utter lack of respect for an entire
community [i.e. the black commu-
nity]. Mr. Bailey’s feelings are
understandable in light of the
mythical history that he—and most
Americans—have about the War
Between the States. That mythical
history posits thatthe War occurred
when eleven Southern states se-
ceded from the Union in a base
attempt to preserve slavery and
that the loyal North fought the
South to free the slaves and restore
the Union. Given this understand-
ing of history, it is no wonder that
Mr. Bailey and so many other
Americans, black and white, loathe
the Confederate flag. But this “his-
tory” is simply false.

In his editorial, Mr. Bailey
noted that those who support the
Confederate flag base their sup-
port on the argument that the Civil
War occurred over economic or

various other issues. However,
Mr. Bailey states that he, “‘and the
majority of the African-American
race, have yet to be convinced that
slavery was not the central issue
{ofthe War].” Inthis limited space
I cannot dispute the many
ahistorical assumptions underly-
ing Mr. Bailey’s editorial. Instead,

slaves, there were sectional ani-
mosities. As.Commander of the

Continental Army, George Wash-.

ington found it necessary to issue
an order promising punishment to
any man who incited “the existing
sectional feeling” (McGuire, Can-
federate Cause and Conduct).
Later, when the states were con-

tution, this fear soon proved well-
founded, as Virginia, the two Caro-
linas, and Georgia came to pay
75% of the cost of supporting the
federal government (Bledsoe, Js
Davis a Traitor?). :

To decry the Confederate flag as racist because the dregs
of society have associated it with their hateful cause is to
appalling disregard for history.

display an

I would like to focus on the central
fallacy of his article, namely, that
slavery was the central issue of the
Civil War.

The conflict between North
and South existed long before the
Civil War. Indeed, the Civil War
was but the culmination of the
struggle between the two regions.
During the American Revolution,
when both North and South held

sidering adoption of the Constitu-
tion, one of the chief Southern com-
plaints against it was that it would
allow the North, which would be
numerically superior in Congress,
to regulate trade.. The Southern
states knew this was dangerous, as
the Northern and Southern econo-
mies were considerably different
and often had opposing interests.
With the ratification of the Consti-

slave trade. Northern ports brought
in tremendous income from trad-
ing slaves to South American coun-
tries (Kennedy, The South Was
Right!). Atthe Constitutional Con-
vention, Massachusetts and New
Hampshire voted against immedi-
ately ending the slave trade be-
cause of the windfall profits they
enjoyed from that trade (Bledsoe).
When the profits from the slave

trade were invested in industry, the
North demanded a high protective
tariff to protect those industries,
federally-funded internal improve-
ments to facilitate its industrial
trade, and a national bank to facili-
tate monetary exchange. The South
opposed the North in all of these
issues, deeming a high protective
tariff baneful to its economy, and
federally-funded internal improve-
ments and a national bank gross,
unconstitutional usurpations of
power never granted to the federal
government. The North was furi-
ous, and sought a means to achieve
its will against Southern opposi-
tion. They found that means in
slavery.

Around 1844, an intimate
friend of a Northern congressman
asked the congressman why he and
other Northerners were agitating
for abolition. The Northern Con-
gressman replied, “‘The real rea-
son is that the South will not let us
have a tariff, and we touch them
where they will feel it [i.e. sla-
very]’” (Kennedy).

While the North, outnumber-
ing the South in the House and

A Different Perspective: Ike Bailey
African-Americans are inherently successful.

Biv you ever wondered why
African-Americans seém so set on
talking about racial issues? Why
they seem to be so uncomfortable

in a society which is built on the:

theory that all men are created
equal? Why they seem to harp on
every little thing? Why can’t they
just grow up and work as hard as
white folks?

It’s probably because there just

seem to be too many coincidences .

that say something is wrong. Com-
mon sense would tell you who
would benefit the most if racial
issues and racial problems would
happen to disappear: African-
Americans. So, it must also be
logical to say that there has to be
some validity. behind their com-
plaints.

We are constantly question-
ing if we truly belong here. Do we
belong in a country which fights
for its own freedom and simulta-
neously takes away ours? Should

we love a country which says all
men are created equal, then treats
us like animals? Should we re-
spect a country which teaches us
self-hate and hate us for not loving
it?

We are called a “violent”
people, even though it is obvious
that nothing can get more violent
than slavery. But doesn’t the fact
that African-Americans make up
about half of the prison population
prove just how violent they are?
How logical is it to assume that a
group that makes up only 17% of
the population can be responsible
for half of the crimes? Is it their
violent nature, or an extremely bi-
ased justice system?

We are often thought of as
being lazy and unambitious. The
African-American unemployment
rate constantly hovers in double:
figures, and as far as percentages
go, we are more likely than anyone
else to live in poverty. Can an

entire group of people really be
that lazy, or it there some other
force not being recognized?

Of course, we all know how
unintelligent African-Americans
are. But by whose definition? We
can look across the board and see
how white students score higher
on “intelligence” tests than do Af-
rican-Americans. What we ne-
glect to see is the fact that when
culturally biased questions are re-
moved, that the scores are much
more similar. So, what does that
say about our definition of intelli-

gence—are we only intelligent if

we think and act as white Ameri-
cans?

Haven’t you ever wondered

- why the only real things we learn

inschool about African-Americans

all seem to be centered around ~

slavery and civil rights? Why
weren’t we taught that Africans

This article is inresponse to Chad
Ossman’s bitter article last week
in which he degrades a major part
of American culture: professional
sports. lama sports fan, and I love

to watch various games, competi- -

tions, etc. I have to agree with
Chad that such behavior as the
recent baseball strike is ridiculous.
But I believe that Mr. Ossman has
carried his caustic attitude too far.
It’s not really that bad, Chad.

He states in his article entitled
“Pro sports: a national fetish” that
he is “sick” of seeing sports stories
“commandeering a good chunk of
the evening news” and that he
wishes sports could have theirown
outlet such as- Entertainment To-
night so that people like Chad don’t
have to “sit through the sports to
get to the weather.” Now, if Chad
really does watch the evening news

regularly, he should know that most ’

stations place sports at the end of

the news so that those not athleti-

‘cally inclined don’t have to watch.

Also, I don’t think that five min-
utes of the audience’s time consti-
tutes a “good chunk of the news.”
There is a lot about the news that I
don’t like either, but it is not the
sports coverage. Sports fans want
to see highlights, scores, and up-
coming games. That is all; no
nonsense. Just five minutes of
catching us up on all of the info we
sports fans missed.

* What I really do not want to
see on the news is how to make a
Western omelette or how to turn a
newspaper into a neat little angel
fora Christmas decoration. Andas
for your weather report, why do I
have to sit through five minutes of
worthless radar screens, record
highs and lows, barometric pres-

sure, anda report froma guy named
Bob up in Yahoo county who says
he recorded .56 inches instead of
.58 that the station recorded just to
find out that it will be cold and
rainy tomorrow?

I don’t know if you were play-
ing little league baseball or city
league soccer when you were grow-
ing up or not, Chad, but obviously
you never had a pro sports idol.
Maybe you were playing Dungeons
and Dragons or Zelda with your
friends, so maybe your hero is Bill
Gates or Conan the Barbarian, or
maybe it is Willard Scott, which is
OK. I don’t care who your idol is
or what you want to watch, but
please don’t criticize others for
what they want to watch.

When I was growing up, my
heroes were people like Dale

Murphy and Mike Schmidt (who
are former major league baseball
players), and I have continued to
idolize these types of athletes be-
cause I respected their ability to do
something F love to do: play base-
ball. Professional athletes are the
best at what they do, just like pro-
fessional musicians and artists are
the best at what they do. For youto
criticize the popularity of my idols
is the same as criticizing someone
for idolizing Jimi Hendrix, Jerry
Garcia, or Pablo Picasso. They
make, or made, much more than
professional athletes, so you should
criticize the nation for feeding those
machines as well.

I’m glad that you made the
point that professional sports are
really an entertainment industry.

Of course they are, All sports are

forms of entertainment, just as
music and painting. But they are
all also forms of art. Just as a
sculptor or musician uses skills in
creating a song or statue, a quarter-
back uses his skill acquired through
experience to lead his team to vic-
tory. People are entertained when
they watch these athletes, or art- |
ists, creating something beautiful
to them. Why criticize people for
supporting the arts, Chad?

I wish you hadn’tbeen socaus-
tic in your article, because if you
could see the beauty in a Jerry Rice
reception or a Magic Johnson no-
look pass, then you would pay
money so that you could see their
talents displayed over and over. If
I don’t want to have to sit through
the weather to see the sports, I'll
just turn on ESPN. If you don’t
want to have to hear about sports to
see the weather, then there is al-
ways The Weather Channel.
