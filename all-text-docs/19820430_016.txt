Record reviews

In a time when many of rock and
roll’s working class pose as alienated
this'or mutant that, Joe “King” Car-
rasco and the Crowns are more than
happy to make fun, energetic music
for the humans in the race. The
group’s third album, Synapse Gap, is
an unpretentious, well-played collec-
tion of bouncy love songs. Consisting
of Joe King’s clear, sonorous. guitar
and yiping vocals; the driving rhythm
of bassist Brad Kizer and drummer
Dick Ross; and the magical key-
boards and vocal support of Kris
Cummings; this Texas-based com-
bo’s music is infectious, spreading
the enjoyable “Austin shakes” wher-
ever it’s heard.

Side A opens with a fast-paced
dance-inducing song that accuses one
of the participants of being “Imitation
Class.” “Person-person” follows as a
new edition to the corpus of rock-and-
roll phone calls. Joe calls some gal for
a date, but at the time she’s already set
up for some bowling with Herman.
Don't despair! Kris Cummings’s or-
gan reigns down a solo reminiscent of
Ray Manzarek in “Light My Fire” and
Joe regains control by song’s end, one
color TV and stereo richer. The next
sounds heard from this record are lift-
ed straight from the late Bob Marley’s
“No Woman, No Cry,” but after the
quoted opening Joe earnestly delivers

Ne UG a aa ae MS Us ke J och ial Like the Police and B-52s, Joe King
and his Crowns generate a great deal
of musical energy through the inter-
“play. of very basic melodies and
thythms. The. songs here always
reach a fullness with their solid vocal
harmonics and the ubiquitous siren of
Kris Cummings’ s organ.
Side B regnains consistent with the
free beat of its predecessor and is
highlighted by the undeniable “Rip It
up, Shake It Up.” This face opens
with Joe’s possessive Speedy Gonzal-
ez voice, shrieking “Ai Ai Ai Ai Ail”
leading into “Wanna Get that Feel
