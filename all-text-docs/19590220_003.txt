ous match. Milton Gee, Harold
Westervelt, Jim Allen, and Alex
Porter won in last Monday's
tussel, but pins and forfeits
in the light weight divisions
proved disastrous.

Parker commented dolefully,
“Pfeiffer was kind of. slow,. but
I knew it was coming — wasn't
anything I could do about it.”

DEMONS ROUTED

Things had looked rosy be-
fore the dance weekend when
the ‘Cats mauled Wake Forest's
not-so-demonaic - Deacons 33-5.
The Baptists’ only points came
from a forfeit and a two-point
loss by decision. Davidson won
all but one match by falls. In
an unofficial freshman match,
the four wildkittens who made
the trip won also.

Parker was not optimistic
about today's match against
V.M.I. He said that. even at
full strength his boys would
have a tough time against the
Keydets and with the present

personnel situation, “we will
be lucky to win in three or
four weights.”

V.P.1. RUGGED
=a. .

He was even less enthusiastic
about the V.P.1. match tomor-
row. V.P.L, probably the best
wrestling team in the south,
has beaten the likes of Auburn |
and ACC champion, Maryland.
Parker surmised that Gee, Al-
len, Westervelt and possibly
Porter “have a chance to win.”

Westervelt, the Conference
167 pound champ is likely to
face Tom Burris, also a confer-
ence title holder. Undefeated
Milton Gee may have to tackle
brilliant Sherman Van Donen-
der, who has been a loop
champion for three years. V.P.I.
also had two other title holders
in the 130 and 137 weight class-
es.

The ‘Cats end their regular
season here this Wednesday at
3:30 with a match against
strong Washington .and Lee.

Swimmers Race U.S. C;
Look To Conference Meet

By BILL

GODWIN

The Wildcat varsity and freshmen swim team met
South Carolina yesterday in Columbia with the confer-
ence tourney only one week off.

With a victory Coach Tuck-!

er’s tankmen would wind up
ithe regular season with seven
‘wins in ten matches. Last year
Carolina was beaten’ impres-
rgively, 48-38.

“I the boys don’t let down
after that Washington and
Lee meet,” Coach Tucker

| said Wednesday, “we ought
to come out al! = right.”

; W & L, a non-conterence
team, dunked the ‘Cats handi-
ly last Friday, 60 to 29.

Back on the. Carolina meet.
Teeser looked to his greatest
strength — distance. He point-
cd out Tom Hudgins and Jim
Alexander in that departhent.

But his divers, he
plained, were doubtful. Jack
Columbia, was sick and Jen-
nings Snider, out for football,’

had scarcely practiced this,
week.

Said Tucker, “We've got
. one point in our favor,

though. We always win on ;
the road.”

He expected the Citadel to!
be the toughest competition in
the Southern ‘Conference meet.’

“Uf it weren't for Citadel's
depth and _ its;
svrinters, we definitely could‘
vin,” Coach Tucker said. “But
next year, if all our boys re-!
turn (exeept senior captain Bob:
Wytne), we WILL win.”

angle affair. The riflers own a
5-0 Western Conference 4qver-

W & L's Generals edged past
the ‘Cats last Wednesday, post-
ing a 1368 to Davidson's 1362.

Wofford in Spartanburg on Fri-
day. Ronald Fonda led the
scoring with a 282.. followed by
Gaines’ 277 and Harper’s 275.

On March 4+ the team will
travel to Morgantown, West
Virginia, for the Southern Con-
ference Tournament. The Cita-
del, which is the only team to
down the ‘Cats on Southern
Confercnee competition this
year, will be favored to take
the conference crown.

The 'Cats, sporting a 5-0 rec-
ord, have an excellent chance
to win the Western Conference
title. If the riflers beat P.C. to-
day, the title will be sewed up.
