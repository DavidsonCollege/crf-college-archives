Uninspired speculation

I admit that I am confused. In
between fiestas on the court, battles
with my Organic Chemistry book,
and picking change out of the couch
for Papa John’s, a seemingly
insolvable dilemma has wormed
its way into my consciousness. Is
there a God?

Last week’s “Inspired Ram-
bling” professes the affirmative
position. Indeed, it appears that
Kevin Ager has found the meaning
- of life, or at least the ability to
rationalize failure through the be-
lief in a higher being. He claims,
“there is absolutely no meaning on
earth without God. The entire uni-
verse means nothing without a
greater purpose.”

Hmm ... I am not too sure
how to interpret that statement.
What’s the “meaning” of life is
like asking what is the “meaning”
of a cup of coffee. What is meant
by the fact that I have brown hair,
am 5’ 8’’, and enjoy Kool and the
Gang? Surely the existence of
God doesn’t give meaning to funky
music? Ordoes it ...? Does “mean-
ing” imply purpose or function?

Coffee serves to alleviate a caf-
feine craving. Music soothes the
savage beast. Darwin would argue
the meaning of life is to reproduce.

Again, Ager’s words struck a
discordant note on the strings in-
side my brain: “without faith noth-
ing has meaning, and we as hu-
mans measure

Or would faith be defined as

. belief without supporting evidence

or proof? It seems the religious
construct of faith is used to cir-
cumvent the normal modality of
reason and the rational. Some
people may liken faith in God to
faith in the existence of unicorns.

be an insurmountable, exhaustive
task. It takes an infinite amount of
observations to prove a hypothesis
or theory correct, yet only one to
prove it false. So this is why I take
the latter position. Until a unicorn
is detected somewhere, I am going
to believe that they don’t exist.

mean a group or collection of core
beliefs (e.g. the Catholic or Pres-
byterian Faith)? Certainly, scien-
tists base their lives on this kind of
reasoning. Mathematics rests on
the foundation of several, unprov-
able axioms. Physicists believe
Einstein’s conjecture that the laws
of nature are the same in all inertial
reference frames.

We can search the world over and
never find a unicorn. Have we
truly looked everywhere?

Maybe Mr. Unicorn hides in

_the bushes when we come search-

ing. Just because we can’t find a
unicorn doesn’ tclearly indicate that
they don’t exist.

Trying to prove the existence
of God or of the unicorn proves to

possibly even devil worship. Sup-
pose instead of an ordinary college
student with a strange sense of
humor, I was Super Rob, the inde-
structible, the invincible giant ro-
bot.

If I never needed food, and
nothing could ever hurt me, than
nothing in the world would be of
any value. The fact that I am not

Super Rob - that I can be hurt and
have certain necessities for living -
implies a system and hierarchy of
values. My values thus stem from
biological necessity, the environ-
ment in which I was raised, the
values society has deemed impor-
tant, and a conscious effort to find
truth in the world.

Is it sufficient to then live life
for its own sake? Can life be inter-
preted as a goal or end in itself? It
is a natural human tendency to
look for “meaning” or “purpose”
in random events. However, it is
by no means obvious that life is the
sort of thing that has so-called
meaning.

Why rationalize failure, in-
equality, and self-doubt with a
higher, ultimate purpose? Maybe
I would feel different if I had read
the Dec 3rd issue of Parade maga-
zine. The fact that I am alive, and
enjoy living is reason enough for
me to live. I am not claiming to
have all the answers to this ques-
tion, merely that I am searching for
them. Certainly, others here at
Davidson are looking, too.

I was a teenage Russian

I had never spent any signifi-
cant amount of time outside the US
before in my life.. My first-hand
experiences with other culture
mainly consisted of contacts I had
with the international students at
college — quite a few of whom —
lam friends with. However, given
the fact that I attend Davidson, this
was rather small-scale introduc-
tion to other cultures. To quench
my thirst for adventure to foreign
lands, I decided to study in Russia
for a semester. I had already taken
two years of Russian at Davidson,
so [hada good base of preparation.
However, no amount of prepara-
tion could have prepared me fully
for what I experienced last semes-
ter.

It was so thrilling to be able to
see so many parts of the Russian
culture as well as its modern live-
lihood. I saw how Russia is coping
with its conversion from the So-
viet Union to a modern, demo-
cratic society. At times it was
exciting, and at times it was scary.

While studying for a month in
St. Petersburg, I got my first in-
kling at just how rich some of the
nouveau-riche of Russia have be-
come since the decentralization of
the economy. Along Nevsky
Prospekt, which is St. Petersburg’s
answer to Fifth Avenue in New
York, [saw many swanky and chic
shops, restaurants, and bars. In the
streets in front of these shops,
BMWs and Mercedes-Benz were
the cars of choice for many of their
patrons. To my surprise, many of
these shops had guards with three-

piece suits standing in front of the
doors of the shops. Any time I
tried to enter one of these places
just to look (due to the fact that
many of these places had prices
that would have made the czars
who used to live in St. Petersburg
blanch), I was stopped and the
guards interrogated me.
Oftentimes, my less-than-pretty
Russian usually led them to de-
duce that I was just a confused,
foreigner rather than a hit-man. ©

However, with the ‘winners,
there are inevitably people who
lose out on some opportunities. As
I studied in Moscow for four
months, it seemed at every turn
there were old women or legless
veterans begging. These poor souls
are the victims of the social net
which was ripped out from under-
neath them when the Soviet Union
collapsed. Pensions are now one-
fourth of what they once were.

It broke my heart every single
time I saw a woman who could
have very well have been my grand-
mother out begging for money.
Perhaps this is why many people
actually want the Communists to
return to power.

As a Political Science major,
one of my goals for coming to
Russia was to gain a decent knowl-
edge of the current political life in
Russia. In the United States, my
knowledge of politics in Russia
extended little beyond Commu-
nists, Boris Yeltsin, and Vladmir
Zhirinovsky thrown in for comic
relief.

Perhaps I got a better insight

into it than at other times since
Russia was counting down to its
parliamentary election on Decem-
ber 17. In the election, there were
43 parties representing every
“color” of the political spectrum.
Ofcourse, there were the Com-
munists and Zhirinovsky’s badly
named Liberal Democratic Party.
There were also more democracy-
oriented parties such as. the
Yabloko (“apple” in Russian) party
and the Democratic Choice of Rus-
sia party. There was even a Beer
Lovers’ Party and Generation X
Party thrown in for good measure.
This almost makes the choice
between the comparatively some-
what-liberal Democrats and the
somewhat-conservative Republi-
cans look boring. Even Russian
TV aired numerous political ad-
vertisements showing everything
from the traditional “we will make
life better” spot to a music video
where a woman sings the praises
of Zhirinovsky to godawful music.
It soon dawned on me that the
reason for all of this confusion and
shouting is that everyone has a
different idea about how Russia
should be run. Isn’tthat better than
the “one true way” of Communisn
during the days of the Soviet
Union?
Even though the Communists
did win the parliamentary elec-
tions, I do not think that they will
stymie the growth of democracy in
Russia. I feel that it has already
taken too strong of aroot forit to be
weeded out without much trouble.
‘People are simply discon-

tented with the state of their lives
and the struggle to stay ahead. Like
all angry voters, they want to
“throw the bums out.” Unfortu-
nately, there are only so many sets
of bums. So, after throwing out the
Communists in 1991 for Yeltsin,
and throwing out the reformers for
nationalists like Zhirinovsky in
1993, they feel that they have no
choice but to return to the Commu-
nists. This is despite the fact that
the Revolution is quite dead.

Religion is back in Russia in
full force after being suppressed
by the Soviet Union. Even the
Communists now have a pro-reli-
gion plank in their platform.

When I observed the Commu-
nist parade here on Revolution Day,
the crowd consisted of particularly
unexciting middle-age to elderly
people who ‘seemed particularly
devoid of the revolutionary fervor
that one associates with Russia and
Communists. After a while, I was
so bored and cold that I bought a
cup of tea at that bastion of capital-
ism — McDonald’s.

What all of this shows is that
old or young, rich or poor, angry or
happy, the tapestry of Russian cul-
ture is woven so tightly that these
strains will not wrinkle it, let alone
tear it apart.

Russia has undergone far
worse strain in its long history. In
Novgorod, Russia’s oldest city (al-
though, ironically “Novgorod”
means “new city”), 30 people, out
ofan original population of 50,000,
survive Germany’s occupation
during World War II. In all of

’ Russia, 20,000,000 people died

during this time (half at the hands
of Stalin).

Yet, at the center of
Novgorod’s Kremlin, there is a
statue dedicated to the first 1,000
years of Russian culture from 886-
1886. Many foes, foreign and do-
mestic, have tried to put an end to
this culture. None have succeeded.
I don’t think anyone ever will.

Pass/Fail

from page 7

there is no reason not to allow him/
her toreceive that grade. Of course
that course would count as their
pass/fail for the semester or year,
but if they did the work and put in
the effort and did better than they
had expected, they should get the
grade they earned.

I propose that Davidson ex-
tend its pass fail period to 5 or 6
weeks so students have the oppor-
tunity to get feedback in their
classes and that we allow students ©
to drop the pass/fail grade and opt
for the grade they earned at any
time during the year. This would
be more fair and would encourage
students to keep trying and not
blow off classes. No one (faculty,
administrators, or students) has
given any reason why my proposal
should not be adopted and I would
be interested to hear the other side,
if it exists.

Sincerely,

Eric Sapp '98
