Although the women’s track
team finished last at the Southern
Conference championships this
weekend in Johnson City, Tenn.,
the team scored the most points
(27) ataconference meet in school
history.

A sense of optimism pre-
vailed afterwards.

“Everyone did really well.
People were getting PR’s (per-

forward to next year when we can
do even better,” said freshman
Jamilah Sawyer, whose time of
15.20 in the 100-meter hurdles
earned her a third place finish and
all-conference honors. “Good
things are going to happen next
year.”

If this weekend’s results will
ultimately serve as an indicator,
Sawyer’s optimism is well-
grounded.

Danielle Mall, who captured
the league discus title as a fresh-
man last spring, fell three inches
short of defending her crown, tak-
ing second with a toss of 141’6.”’

Venessa Sims set a new
Davidson standard by clearing
5’7’’ in the high jump, which
earned her a third-place finish and
all-conference recognition.

“Twas ecstatic. Icleared5’7’’
on my third attempt so I wasn’t
sure I would get it. All my team-
mates jumped up, and everyone
was quite supportive,” Sims said.
“Tt made a lot of difference having
more numbers on the team all
year, not just in this meet.”

The 4x100 relay team (Sims,
Sawyer, Laura Burkholder, and
Roxie Formey) also claimed third
(51.52), grabbing an all-confer-
ence spot.

(Burkholder, Sawyer, Sims, and
Suzy Burr) didn’treach all-confer-
ence, but did set a Davidson record
of 4:13.8 on their way to Sth.
“Since all point-getters are
returning we hope to improve on
this, and maybe not finish last,”
Coach Beth Puckett said after fall-
ing seven points short of Marshall.
The rain did make conditions
difficult, delaying the meet at times

and creating dangerous situations.
Sawyer mentioned some of the
problems the athletes had in the
100 hurdles. |

“Tt was areally bad race. One
of the girl from App. St. fell and
rolled into the leading girls lane.
Two WCU girls got injured, and
it wasn’t a pretty race, but I’m
happy that I stuck through it, and
got third place,” she said.

While the youthful men’s
track team took their lumps in the
Southern Conference Champion-
ships this past weekend in
Johnson City, Tenn., the promis-
ing program caught a glimpse of
its bright future.

“The team has come a long
way,” said Dan Dearing, who
placed fourth in javelin. “We only
lose two seniors next year, and
the guys coming back will form a
strong core. We are starting to get
established as a program. We
don’t want to be the team that
people step on anymore.”

And the Wildcats are indeed
improving. Dearing’s finish in
the javelin put the squad on the
scoreboard, a feat they were un-
able to accomplish this winter at
the indoor championships.

“T was a little worried at first
because my first throw (in jav-
elin) is usually my best, but it was
horrible. On my fifth throw I broke
my personal record by seven feet,”
Dearing said.

was disqualified for a trail leg
violation) because I would have
been the first guy in recent
Davidson history to place in two

Team’s future looks bright

“I was really disappointed ~

events,” he continued, “But I’m ~

excited about next year. I have a
very good shot at placing high, if
not winning both events.”

In addition to Dearing, other
athletes logged top six finishes.

Tim O’ Keefe ran a personal
best 9:57 in the 3000-meter
steeplechase to finish eighth. Josh
Cookson captured ninth with a
15:40 in the 5000, while both the
4x 100 (John Leslie, Steve Hsieh,
Karim Lawrence, and Carlos
Bowen) and 4x400 (Leslie,
Dearing, Hsieh, Lawrence) relay
teams grabbed seventh.

““We were the youngest team
out there and, considering our
inexperience, I thought we did
pretty well,” said Lawrence, who
ran with a strained hamstring.

“T wish we had done better
overall, bat there were some solid
performances,” added coach
Gary Andrew. “This is a young
team, and we are going to be
improving and getting more com-
petitive every year.”

._ Josh Cookson echoed
Andrew’s optimism, noting that
everybody improved steadily
throughout the season.

“In the future, we'd like to
score more points, and we’ ve got
to get everybody to keep improv-
ing,” said Cookson. “For myself,
I’ve got to start running with the
best in the conference, but we all
showed we can compete.”

The men’s tennis team
rounded out their season this week-
end in Greenville, S.C. with a fifth
place finish at the Southern Con-
ference Tournament. The Wild-
cats were led by sophomore Jon
Pastel, their number one singles
player, who won his first ever con-
ference championship.

Pastel, the Southern Confer-
ence Player of the Year, finished
his undefeated conference cam-
paign by blowing through the com-
petition to capture Davidson’ s first
#1 singles champion in overtwenty
years.

Pastel dropped only nine
games on theway to his champion-
ship battle with Juan DeAngulo,
his arch rival from ETSU.

“T always enjoy playing Juan,”
Pastel said. “ We have a way of
bringing out the best in each other,

making this final one of the most
exciting matches of my year.”

5-7; 6-1.

“Pastel is so dependable,” as-
sistant coach Bryce Plott said.
“This is the first of many champi-
onships to come at #1 singles.”

Indeed, Pastel’s league domi-

nance in 1995-96 has vaulted ©

Davidson tennis into the limelight.

“Next year we can’t use the
excuse that we are young and inex-
perienced anymore,” sophomore
Ted Kaplan said. “ We were con-
tenders this year and should be one
of the favorites next year.”

Golf team grabs fifth

They claim their best finish since 1974

By CLAYTON SCHLOSS

It’s late April» The grass is
green and the flowers are bloom-
ing. The warm weather lightens
our spirits.

It is this time of year when
golfers make their annual trip to
golf’s mecca, The Masters at Au-
gusta (GA) National Golf Club.

Hidden in thé lush forests sur-

rounding the quaint little town of
Augusta lies an unparalleled golf
course-6,925 yards of perfection.
The best golfers in the world are
awe-stricken, acting like little kids
on their first trip to Disneyland.

Augusta is breathtakingly
beautiful, yet deceptively danger-
ous. Those who ultimately survive
the potentially nightmarish maze
are able to look past the stunning
distractions of the azaleas, dog-
woods, and magnolia trees.

Wildcat golfers participated
in their own Masters on Apr. 15
and 16 in the Southern Conference
Championships, held this year at
Stoney Creek Golf Club outside
Greensboro.

Davidson skillfully skirted
Stony Creek’s traps, tying for fifth
place, its best finish since 1974.

The playing conditions made
the already challenging courseeven
more difficult and often frustrat-
ing. Rain on Monday slowed the

fairways and strong Tuesday winds
wreaked havoc. The combination
of the the inclement weather and
extremely fast and undulating
greens caused unusually high
scores.

Andy McDaniel, who tied for
12th place, seemed to be the least
affected by the conditions, as his
impressive 80-78-75 (17 over par)
led the Wildcats.

“Timproved each round, and I
came back from my mistakes,” said
McDaniel, “I was really proud of
the way everyone played.”

Jason Lina (79-77-80, +20)
and Jason Carlock (76-80-80, +20)
tied for 16th place.

“We played really well and
moved up to fifth place from ninth
last year,” said Lina, “Hopefully
we will move up even further next
year.”

David Alexander (83-83-85,
+35) and Dan Tedrick (93-78-83,
+38) finished 43rd and 46th, re-
spectively.

Nationally ranked East Tenn.
St. ran away with the team title,
winning by a 24-stroke margin.

“T was very pleased with our
finish. Noone shined that far above
the others, but we had solid team
play,” said coach Joe Mark, “Our
guys hung in there and succeeded
in moving up in the standings.”

All five of the Wildcats’ top
golfers return next year.

Women take third in
rain-soaked weekend

By MIcHAEL KRUSE
Assistant Sports Editor

The women’s tennis team

.combined youth with experience

to place a solid third in the South-
ern Conference tournament this
weekend, held at Davidson’s
Covington Courts.

Claire Cheatwood, at #6
singles, and co-captain Ashley
Maner, playing in the third slot,
both starred, —

Cheatwood, just a freshman,
surprised the field by capturing the
sixth-seed championship, topping
her Georgia Southern opponent

easily, 6-3, 6-0, in the finals.

“T was real nervous before the
match, so it was a great feeling to
overcome my nerves like that,”
said Cheatwood, “I was real ex-
Maner also reached her
final, falling toGSU’s Rita Wilms,
6-1, 6-1.

All of Sunday’s matchups ex-
cept the finals were called early-on
in anticipation of rainy conditions.
Ultimately, the weather cleared,
but the decision stood, sending the
six singles and three doubles cham-
pionship matches, indoors to
Knobloch Tennis Center.

Therefore, first-seed Dana
Casner and second-seed Amber
Bradford, both of whom would
have played for fifth place on Sun-
day, and fourth-seed Clara Marks
and fifth-seed Lynn Shore, both of
whom would have vied for third,

were forced to the sideline.
Davidson’s top doubles tan-

dem of Casner and Bradford lost in

their semifinals on Saturday to the.

‘tourney’s eventual winner, while

the second duo, Cheatwood and
Marks, would have battled for fifth
place.

The third Wildcat doubles
team, Maner and Jane Stubbs,
barely fell in their semifinal bid, 3-
6, 7-6, 7-6.

“We all wanted to play it out,”
said Casner, “but we had to make a
decision early because some of the
schools were far away. There was
nothing we could do.”

“The whole notion was to get
all the kids out there playing, but
there was no way to anticipate that
(the threat of rain) breaking,” said
head coach Caroline Price, “Based
on all the information we had, it
was the right choice.”

Added assistant coach Bar-
bara Grooms, “It was kind of
dissapointing, but the decision had:
to be made. It was a great tourna-
ment for everyone.”

The team standings through
Saturday’s action were deemed fi-
nal, giving Georgia Southern the
team title.

With only Stubbs graduating
this spring, much of the team’s
core will return next year for an-
other run at the conference title.

Said Price, “With our young
team, I can only see good things in
the future.”
