Fraternities' Fliers Spark Controversy Among Students

By Meredith Boone
and Leigh McKeever
In response to several contro-
versial party fliers, Rusk House
withdrew most of their financial
and social support from Sigma
AlphaEpsilon’s Electric Jello party
on October 18th, with seven hours
advance warning. Rusk did pay for
half of the products that had al-
ready been bought before they
decided to withdraw. .
The fliers and Rusk’s response
to them have created controversy
among Davidson students. Stu-
dents have - voiced their dis-
taste for Phi Delta Theta's 1-900-

AIR-BAND flyer and one of the
acts in the competition.

One group of performers wore
only red socks over their genitals
while they imitated sexual acts with
an inflatable female doll. Some
members of the audience likened
the performance to a gang rape,
and left the party as a result.

Depicted on the SAE flyers
were several defaced Nagel repro-
ductions with captions such as
“Oral Annie,” ‘Carrie Collie,” and
“Tanya Tightbody.” In the case of
“Oral Annie,” the sketch was of a
woman on all fours, provocatively
dressed. Other comments on the

Gulf War Strategist
Discusses Air Campaign

By Kevin Miller

Major General Buster C. Glos-
son, director of all United Sates
Air Force tactical planning and
maneuvering and the man who
General Norman Schwarzkopf
called the “one person most re-
sponsible for America’s success-
ful air campaign throughout the
Gulf conflict,” spoke Thursday
night in the 900 room on “When
Diplomacy Fails.”

Glosson explained that when
our nation went to war in January
1991 we did not go to war because
of failure in diplomacy. Instead,
he said that the administration
exhausted all possible avenues of
resolve to find that the use of mili-
tary force was the only solution to
asituation that was becoming more
dangerous by the day, ~

Glosson said that force should
be used as only a last resort, and
that it should not be done out of
frustration and anger towards an-
other nation, or because the ad-
ministration was not creative
enough to find an alternative solu-
tion. He did say however, “if a

nation does not use military force
atall, it will become aneasy victim
to an aggressor.”

Glosson then outlined the four -

factors that should be met before a
nation uses force. He also showed
how the United States and the
United Nations used these factors
before engaging in war on Iraq.
First, he said a nation should
use up all possible political and
economic plans of resolution be-
fore using force. Although the
United Nations’ use of the sanc-
tions toward Iraq met this condi-
tion, Glosson said that Saddam
Hussein was supplying his troops,
building up his capabilities and
continuing to trade so well that
these sanctions would not resolve
the conflict. He also’ said that if

these sanctions had continued, a -

move favored by many critics of
the Gulf War, the support of all the
other nations and of the American
people would have dwindled

greatly. be

flyers included “She likes to slurp
it whole.”

Mary Faith Mount and Mary
Bryan, co-chairs of Rusk’s social
board decided to withdraw Rusk's
support after being approached by
several women... These women
were extremely angry about the
implied association between Rusk
and the fliers. They also expressed
hope that Rusk would sever its
connection with the party.

After discussing the matter with
both Deans of Students Will Terry
and Leslie Marsicano, Mount and
Bryan notified the SAE’s of their
decision to withdraw most finances,

monitors, bartenders, and all other
support from Friday’s party.

Mount felt than the drastic. ac-
tion was necessary. She said, “Oth-
erwise, passively accepting the
fliers would have been condoning
them.”

When approached about the
subject, Dean Terry said, “I think
that the flyers were in poor taste. I
think that the PCC will have to set
up standards because we obviously
can’t depend on individual discre-
tion alone. I do not consider such
standards to be censorship because
they would be coming from the
students versus the administration.”

Terry said, “I think that Rusk
did the most effective
thing....money speaks louder than
words.”

Although Annie Adams, Presi-
dent of Rusk and the Patterson
Court Council, was out of town
during the pull-out decision, she
supported Mount and Bryan’s ac-
tions. Adams said, “Mary Faith
and Mary definitely made the right
decision. It was entirely appropri-
ate. Thisisn’t the first time that this
type of thing has happened.”

As President of the PCC, Adams

Bowdoin Professor Speaks On Nicaraguan
Elections, United States Foreign Policy

By Russ Tisinger

Allen Wells, Professor of His-
tory at Bowdoin College in Maine,
spoke last week in the Morrison
Room about his personal experi-
ence of the 1990 democratic elec-
tions in Nicaragua and United Sates
foreign policy toward Nicaragua
since.

Wellsattempted to explain just
how former President Daniel

Ortega lost the election to now-
president Chamarro. According to
Wells, symbols played an impor-
tant role in the election; much as
they did in the 1988 campaign for
president of the United States.
Wells attended Daniel Ortega’s
final campaign rally before the
February election.

Ortega appeared at the rally
without his usual fatigues, joyful,

with his fists raised high. His
campaign song, “The fighting Cock
with Spurs,” a pop ditty with a
catchy melody, was blaring over
loudspeakers behind him, describ-
ing Ortega as a fierce fighter of
Yankee imperialism. Wells de-
scribed the whole affair as a”half
dance, half political theater.”

1991 andit’s time,” said Giovanni.

America has the right to name
everything.

On poetry, Giovanni said, “If

betterment of mankind, what’s it
for?”

Giovannialso talked about how

earth is just a ball and everyone in
America_needs to be taken into
space to sée that what we are living
on is just a ball. She also said that

-an old lady needs to be sent into

space.

She spoke on how she can’t

aliens from space because every-
one is so ill-prepared to live with
each other on earth. Giovanni
