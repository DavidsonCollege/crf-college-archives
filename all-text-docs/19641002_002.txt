FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1964

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily ceflect the views of the editor.)

Apologia ..

In a letter which appears elsewhere
on this page, two freshmen have
sought to set forth a policy for our
harassed sports editor. This letter
coupled with the coolly reasoned sug-
gestions offered by several football
players, prompts us to comment...

School spirit is the natural expres-
sion of pride in an institution. David-
son—as all schools—has its fair-
weather fans. And in fair-weather fans
we find little school spirit. But in a
smaller group of supporters we find a
sincere expression of true enthusiasm.

It is always easy—and delightful—
to join in the jubilation that aceom-
panies victory. Triumph facilitates ex-
pressed pride in a school.

In defeat, however, there is no
jubilation, there are no cheers: And
the ranks of a team’s “supporters”
grow slim as the fair-weather fans
shrink back. But there are wavs that
true boosters can express their feel-
ings.

Slost important is loyalty, a natural
action of the true fan. The supporter
can look to bright spots: of the season.
The supporter can look to hopes for

Union Reunion...

With the unified bookstore opera-
tion, the college business office anti-
cipates a unity of purpose. Business
Manager Rob@rt A. Currie says the
college hopes to provide: convenient
service and a complete line of educa-
tional material to students through
the new facility. A titanic step in
the right direction.

If student response is somewhat
less than ecstatic, however, the re-
servations may be traced to the ap-
parent absence of any student dis-
count in the face of ever-increasing
textbook costs. The convenience of the
new arrangement is considerable, but
at first glance it would appear that
we're being conveniently fleeced.

But the discount proposition is not
that sample. The one-shot bookstore
is new at Davidson, and its business
operation is untested. Sales volume
should increase because of the con-
venience, and because of the expand-
ed line of merchandise. If the revenue
does in fact increase, the bookstore
stands to realize a sizable profit. We
feel that Davidson students have a
claim to a fair share of this profit. If
the operation is not successful, how-
ever, if the bookstore were to suffer
a loss, the same ethic could not apply.
For this reason, the bookstore is not
offering a discount currently.

A mid-year statement will be pre-
pared in December. This evaluation
can be analyzed, and if the enterprise
reports clear gains we can feel justi-
fied in asserting our right of inquiry.

We hope the December financial
analysis will find the unified book-
store blessed with prosperity. We fur-
ther hope that blessing will manifest
itself in an additional line of digits
near the bottom of our purchase re-
ceipts: that discount we've grown to
know and love over the past two years

subtracted from our bills.

When the Student Store and Knovel
and Knook were moved last year, we
were assured that the nine o'clock
closing time was only temporary——
“until Union, South Wing is settled.”
We have been awaiting the resurrec-
tion of the eleven o'clock closing time
formerly observed by both operations.
Surely the Student Store-bookstore
should be open during the late even-
ing when student use of the Union
is at its peak.

* 8 &
THE DAVIDSONIAN, under past
editors, has advocated a used-book
store where textbooks could be ex-

changed. Since the YMCA discontinu-
ed its used-book exchange a number

better days. And in using this word a
distinction must be made: we are
speaking not only of a sincere wish
but also of a reasonable wish.

We are not speaking of reckless
optimism, an optumism that requires
prostituting one’s integrity in a vain
attempt to put off what appears to
be the bleak certainty of facing an un-
successful season.

*¢6

THE DAVIDSONIAN allows its
columnists extensive freedom: writ-
ers are confined by only the criteria
of truth, good taste, and the law of
libel.

We feel our sports editor has sup-
ported the football team. He has ex-
pressed his opinion that the Wildcats

ave a good chance of winning three
football games. He has expressed his
desire that the team win even more
games.

‘We support his right to express his
opinion free from intimidation. And
we join him in aspiring for a season
that proves his predictions wrong and
satisfies the desires of all Davidson
supporters.

of years ago, the Union has made a
sinking effort at maintaining the ser-
vice. We applaud the Union’s concern,
but books can best be handled, ob-
viously, through a bookstore.

No investment by the College or the
Union would be necessary. Prior to
the semester (or summer) break, in-
terested students would turn in any
books they wished to sell. Students
would set their own prices, markin
them inside the front cover. To offset
expenses of handling the increased
volume, the Union could charge a five
per cent commission.

_ Under the auspices of the new com-
bined bookstore operation. a used-
book exchange could be a concrete
service to students in this day of $8.95
textbooks.

A Spark...

Imagination is always at a premium.

For years the Y has sponsored
voluntary chapels on Wednesday and
Friday mornings. And for years when
the attendance figures soared as high
as ten there was cause for glee.

Each week another student got up
to speak to five fellow students. And
so it went... ;

We find a ray of hope in the volun-
tary chapels scheduled for this fall.
The programs reveal an attempt —
through originality and variety—to
make religion more meaningful.

Wanderlust...

Society is on the move. We are call-
ed a mobile people. Houses are sold,
families uprooted and transplanted.
There are voyages into space. The jet
has jaundiced the glamor of faraway
places.

The young man who went down to
the sea in ships, or struck out on the
open road, is supplanted by television
trips with silky-voiced narrators.

An automobile on a freeway or a
motel room with piped-in music is but
a sterile box of loneliness for the
traveling businessman.

Something has happened to Ameri-
can prose and poetry. We have no
Walt Whitman, no Thomas Wolfe. We
have suburbia, megalopolis and migra-
tion instead.

What has happened to the happy
wanderer? He was a hobo, perhaps,
but more than a tramp, and more than
a vagrant. He was looking for some-
thing beyond the horizon.

Can it be that there are no horizons
eft? Or are they submerged in smog
and indifference—Commercial Appeal

From The Bench

“NO ONE GIVES A DAMN HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME... ITS WHO WINS

THATS IMPORTANT.

Clark Blasted By Frosh:
‘No Win’ Policy Claimed

Dear Editor:

In reference to Johnny Clark's
continued pats on his own back
for his objective and well-reas-
ened onin.ons concerning the
Davidson football season, we
would Exe to venture a sugges-
tion that maybe a little school
spirit and team backing is what
‘is really needed.

We believe that Mr. Clark is
confusing his role as a college

newspaper journalist with that:

of a professional sports writer.
The main duty of a journalist
on a college paper. in our opin:
ion, is not so much to present
his objective, sincere, and well-
reasoned opinion as it is to

& make an objective, sincere, and

well-reasoned attempt to bol-
ster sagging school morale.

This is. what is sorely needed
at Davidson in view of our
much berated football team,
which got a running start last
Saturday to the surprise of
many.

The boys on our team give
their all to practice conscienti-
ouscly, and consequently many
have been injured. It takes a
lot of guts to put on wet clothes,
practice five titmes a week, and
then try to play your heart out
before an apathetic student
body.

It takes real. sacrifice to be
a Wildcat gridder. ‘srese boys

don't need our opinions; they
need our enthusiastic support
and encouragement.

Dear Editor:

If the intent of “An Autumn
Walk” in last week's The Dav-
idsonian was to protest against
a creeping campus commercial-
ism of which your editor ap-
parently stands in great dread,
I should liké to mention how un-
fortunate it was that he did not
write on anything else.

He hardly has an argument,
since one film poster was at-
tached to one. tree ‘in the mid-
‘dle of the thoroughfare be-
tween Belk Dormitory and
Chambers. and it is rather
stretching on the imagination
to suggest that this destroys all
eighty acres of “his goodly tem-
ple to God.”

Perhaps if Mr. Dibble would
like to truly satisfy his craving
for virginal creations of man
and nature he should initiate a
campaign to change Lake Nor-
man into Walden Pond.

Wiseman raises Zealots
In Davidson Self-Analysis

Dear Editor:
Hurray! It was.. and I mean
this sincerely,. most encourag-

ding to read in last Friday's

THE DAVIDSONIAN about the
wonderful changes wrought in
our library as a result of the
current Self-Study program and
Dr. Martin’s fund raising. Fur-
ther, at the risk of quoting a
perhaps un-messianic public
figure, I would add, “Let us
continue."’

I was especially pleased by
the statement in your editorial,
“Browsing,’” that ‘Many of

them did a thorough job of self-.

study and came up with impos-
ing lists of needs."* This occur-
rence is always a good sign, at
least in a directional way, for
when education ceases to be
imposing. it ceases to be edu-
cation.

Every silver chalice, however,
has a cloudy lining, and one
tincture of difficulty bears its
ugly head at me in this case.
I was somewhat concerned over
the statement made about the
History Department's ambitious
requests, asking for ‘“‘twice as
much as any other department.”

I am by no means a history
major, but speaking from the
ranks of the uninitiated, I would
blurt out innocent appreciation
for their ambitiousness, greedy
though it was.

It is very possible that I drew
an invalid inference from your
comment that ‘‘they have some
‘eager-beavers’ in the depart-
ment.” Forgive me if I have
done so, but I should rather
have said, ‘‘we have some ‘eag-
er-beavers' in the department—
Thank God!" Et tu, Charlie?

Of course they are eager, and
hopefully, enthusiastic. We

should be grateful that they have
returned to us and our wall-
watching seats in the depths of
our cave. Let’s not censure them
too harshly if they cast some
shadows on the screen.

Perhaps I have been too im-
petuous, As my idealism settles
into practicality, I realize that
there are. real dangers involved
in allowing these ‘‘eager bea-
ers’’ to circulate unguarded in
our midst.. They are known for
angry polemics, unreasonable
assignments, general ‘‘dys-co-
operation,’’ and causing loss of
either sleeping, slopping. or
slipping by. And, if allowed to
remain unleashed in our pre-
sence, they might even cause
us to become, at least partially,
educated.

Wm. J. Wiseman, Jr.
Davidson College

Editor's note: We fear there
has perhaps been some mis-
understanding with regard
to our use of the term “eag-
er-beavers.”” Nothing dero-
gatory was intended; rather
praise for enthusiasm was
being offered.

Dear Editor:

Charles Ramberg’s September
25 column was certainly an ex-
cellent example of vague
generalization which made no
attempt to be bipartisan or ob-
jective. ,

Ramberg dismisses as_hilar-
iously absurd the existence of
Big Business manipulation in
Republican national conventions.
He seems to have forgotten the
surprise, upset nominations of
Dewey in 1948 and Eisenhower
in 1952 instead of Robert Taft.

Taft was ‘‘Mr. Republican”
then, the most popular man in
the Republican Party. In 1952
he went down the convention
“stretch” with more than
enough delegates pledged to
support him. However, both
Life and Time waged intensive
programs. to stop Taft; many
powerful northern newspapers
waged smear campaigns design-
ed to discredit Taft personally
and question his integrity.

Much support for Ike was
stimulated by mass media, and
a perpetrated schism threw the
nomination to Eisenhower by a
narrow margin.

I do not argue the existence
of ‘“Kingmakers,” but I feel
that Ramberg ignores the obvi-
ous power centralized in large
newspapers and magazines
(Life, Time, Look, Post).

Newspapers, even when not
owned by special interests, are
heavily influenced by the de-
sires of Big Business, since Big
Business advertising constitutes
most newspaper revenue. Mass
media can mould public opinion
along desired lines and exert de-
finite influence on politics.

Ramberg religiously avoids
specifics and examples except
where he oversimplifies Schla-
fly's concepts or takes state-
ments from context. For exam-
ple, Ramberg quickly dismisses
the wheat sent to Russia be-
cause it constituted only five
per cent of U. S. annual output.
But the effective value of 64
million bushels of wheat cannot

-be judged merely upon the per-

centage of U. S. annual output
that they constitute.

Soviet agricultural dynamics
and the relative scarcity of food
must be considered, as well as

availability of wheat on the
world market. Possibly the
scarcity of food would have
forced economic reorganization
in Russia, with funds diverted
from aggression to agriculture.

These and other factors must
be considered to properly eval-
uate the sale of wheat to Rus-
sia: the fact that this wheat
represents five percent of our
national output means little in
itself,

Ramberg laughs off the con-

BY TIM KIMREY
Davidsonian Associate Editor

AMID THE CONSTANT GRUMBLINGS about requir-
ed Chapel and/or boredom, there is periodically heard a
sincere “Thank God for Dr. Ernie Patterson.” Last Tues-
day was such an occasion. Last-minute-writ preparations
and twenty-minute snoozes were joyfully abandoned in
the knowledge that ahead lay 30 minutes of respite from
the long siege of Chapel Dreariness.

Appearing on the Great Issues Program (which is
pretty appropriate, in light of the fact that Dr. Patterson

imself has been something of a Great Issue since coming
to Davidson), the Good Doctor gave a wonderfully pre-
judiced account of the economic atmosphere that sur-
rounds this election year.

It was an entertaining show from the bit of profound-
ly nonsensical poetry by A. E. Housman to the comparison
of the image on the screen and Ye Olde Capitalists from
Arizona—both being hazy. And, if you could contain your
laughter long enough to take the man seriously, it was
obvious that Patterson is an incisive and explicit apologist
for Keynesian economics.

In this day of automation, increasing unemployment
and pleas for states’ rights it would behoove us not to
dismiss with such horror the concepts of centralized
government and national planning.

I often wonder what goes on in Dr. Patterson’s left-
handed head when he so splendidly stands before the
Davidson student body in Chambers Auditorium. I tend to
get the feeling that he views the whole affair as a big
Joke, under the guise of which he obviously hopes to
educate.

Remembering some of his past performances, I
would not have been at all surprised if all the lights and
projectors he had assembled on the stage Tuesday had
not been used. It would be just like him to have covered
the stage with paraphernalia just to make his sleepy au-
dience think something exciting was about to take place
in the Hallowed Hall.

IT SEEMS RATHER STRANGE that two of the most

vehement and out-spoken opponents of federal spending
and public works projects as boosts to the Nation’s eco-
nomy, namely Barry Goldwater and George Wallace, hail
from the states of Arizona and Alabama, two states
which lead the Nation in the amount of federal “pork-
barrel” dollars spent within their boundaries.

THIS YEAR'S FRESHMAN CLASS is composed of
boys (Tradition says that they are not men until they beat
the Sophomores in the Field Day) who averaged 1265 on
their College Boards. While not denying the importance
of scholastic endeavor and achievement, and at the same
time giving whole-hearted assent to Davidson’s aim of
becoming a Blue-Blood in academic circles, I would very
quietly suggest that, if this trend keeps up, Davidson
could well find itself inhabited by 1,000 slightly neurotic
grade-seekers.

It is possible to make whole men out of average
students, you know. The plunge from the upper-10% in
high school to the lower 10% at Davidson is hard on the
ego, and the pressure to stay at the top can be disastrous
to the personality.

America may need a good. five-cent cigar, but what
Davidson needs is a heavier sprinkling of Good Guys,
Characters and Honor Society rejects. ;

L. W. NELSON, JANITOR EXTRAORDINAIRE, has
good reason to be proud this week. It seems that L. W.’s
daughter, 14 year-old Armetta, has taken a more than
passing interest in being a good citizen, which on this
campus would probably be a mark of stupidity.

Along with two of her classmates, Armetta ran a sur-
vey and discovered that there were quite a few people in
her community who were not registered to vote. Thus
they fave aunched thelr ‘own little voter-registration
