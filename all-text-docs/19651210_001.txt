NUMBER TWELVE

Faculty Again Alters Regulation
To Limit Off-Campus Drinking

TWO MAIN POINTS

Burks’ Honor Proposal:
Stirs New Controversy

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Feature Writer

It looks like another tempest
is brewing in the.Davidson tea-
pot. John Burks, senior member
‘of the Honor Court, has propos-
ed what could prove to be radi-
‘cal changes in student govern-
"ment,

Burks’ plan, which he present-
ed to the student body in Mon-
‘day's chapel, contains two cardi-
‘nal points. First he called for
“deletion of the part of the oath
of office taken by members of
‘tthe Student Council and Honor
Court stating ‘that I will be
honor bound to report any viola-
tion of the Honor System or any
other provision of the Constitu-
tion which comes to my atten-
tion.’ ””

He quickly pointed out that
under the Honor System all stu-
dents, including council and
court members, would still be
bound to report honor violations.

‘The second point calls for a
general referendum on all the
Student Body Regulations. Burks
contended, ‘If we say we are
going to make ‘‘duty’’ mean
something to the student body
it seems to me that we must
have a system of regulations af-
firmed by the present student
body and towards which we may
legitimately expect students to
feel responsible.”

The effect of these proposals
would be to place the respon-
sibility for enforcement of the
regulations, which heretofore
has been solely that of Student
Council and Honor Court mem-
bers, equally on the shoulders of

IFC Plans
To Report
Parties

The Interfraternity Council
changed the beginning time for
the final period of silence and
also discussed registering of off-
campus parties, at its regular
meeting Monday night.

The final period of silence was
previously scheduled to begin
Dec. 17 at 5 p.m. In order to
coincide with Christmas break,
this period will begin instead on
Saturday, Dec. 18 at 12:10 p.m.
There is no change in the end
of the period of silence which
will be Monday, Jan. 3 at 8 a.m.

Since the college is now of-
ficially recognizing off-campus
parties, it has required that all
such parties must be registered.
The IFC decided that it would
assume the responsibility for
registering these parties as had
been suggested. Parties must be
registered with the IFC secre-
tary at least 48 hours in advance
of the party. This rule is to go
into effect immediately.

When questioned as to the rea-
son for registering parties, Tom
Covington. fraternity liaison of-
ficer, replied. “‘As far as I am
concerned, it is just to know
where parties are going on in
case of any emergency.”

Discussion turned to the de-
finition of a “party,” but no
complete definition was reached.
It was, however, generally
agreed that any social affair for
which money is taken out of the
fraternity treasury should be
considered a party.

Jim Terry, IFC president, an-
nounced that the annual Christ-
mas party for the Barium
Springs Orphans will be held
Thursday night, Dec. 16. There
will be about 75 children from
age 6 to 12. Each fraternity wil!
have from six to eight children
for supper and a short party.

all students.

At a special Open End Mon-
day night (attended by ten peo-
ple, at least) one student asked
about the possible consequences
if the drinking rule were not re-
tained in the referendum. No-
body ventured to predict defi-
nitely what the administration's
reaction might be.

However, Burks emphasized,
“My proposal is not almed at
any one regulation. It's aimed
at alleviating what I think is a
very unfair method of enforce-
ment of these regulations.”

He revealed that his interest
in changing the existing situa-
tion springs from a study car-
ried out last summer by a com-
mittee, of which he was chair-
man, composed of Honor Court
members. They studied the
honor systems of various other
schools. And read widely on the
subject.

During «the course of this
study, Burks decided that, ‘‘It
is completely illogical and un-

fair to require any one group
of students to be more responsi-
ble than another.”

The result of such a situation ;

[is to set up a police force of a
few students amidst a generally
apathetic student body.

“The main reason that stu- ,

dents don’t feel any responsi-

bility toward these regulations |

is that they don’t approve of
them,” Burks emphasized. ‘‘An-
other reason is that they haven't
had to feel responsible. I don't
think that, (being a policing
body) is the function of a stu-
dent council or honor court.”

Whether or not a special body
{students or others in control
student conduct can be dis-
pensed with remains to be seen.

“The whole thing boils down
to how much value each student
places on maintaining student
jurisdiction in these areas.”
Burks said. ‘‘Let them delete
whichever regulations they don't
believe should be under their
jurisdiction.”

BURKS PRESENTS PLAN AT OPEN END
Claims Students Don’t Approve of Regulations

OATH OF OFFICE

Council Alters Bylaws

The Student Council, in a spe-
cial meeting Wednesday night,
approved a change in the Stu-
dent Body Bylaws which would
make Council and Honor Court
members no longer honor bound
to enforce Student Body Regu-
lations.

OATH OF OFFICE

The change, brought about by
deletion of Section 6 of the Stu-
dent Bylaws, which contains the
oath of office, pased by a 12-0

vote with one abstention and one
absence.

Council president Bill Council
stressed that the change does
not go into effect until a new
oath is taken by Council and
Court members.

The Council also approved a
student hody referendum to be
held Thursday on the Student
Body Regulations. Council will
read the referendum Tuesday in
assembly and a vote will be

Total 566

Applications for admission to
Davidson are running behind
last year’s total while still ahead
of the number received two
years ago, according to H. Ed-
munds White, directer of ad-
missions.

White reported that 566 ap-
plications had been received at
the end of November. On that
date last year, 660 had been re-
ceived, while two years ago the
total was only 495.

For the first time in five
years, all acceptances will be
mailed at the same time, April
14. Previously, the admissions
office had sent them out in three
groups, on Feb. 20. March 20
and throughout April.

NEW METHOD

“The more select colleges
have used this new method for
quite some while,” said White.
“We're switching to it for the
same reasons they did.

‘We think we can do a better
and fairer job by using one ac-
ceptance date. In the past we
were accepting boys before all
the scores and forms were in
We were operating on incom-
plete information.”

Last year admissions reached
decisions on 1274 applications,
accepting 426 or one-third of the
total. Sixty five per cent (278) of
those accepted enrolled this fall.

EARLY DECISION

Sixty boys have already been
accepted .— by early decisions
on Nov. 15. White said he wants
about 270 acceptances, or 210
more.

For Year

“Only once in the past five
years have we missed the de-
sired total enrollment by more
than five," he said. ‘We'll ac-
cept about 340 in April under the
new plan, although we want
only 210. The problem now is
knowing how many will enroll.
It scares the heck out. of me.”

taken Thursday.

The referendum will give stu-
dents a chance to decide which
section of the present regula-
tions they wish to be deleted. If
a particular regulation receives
a two-thirds negative vote it
can be deleted by provision of
Constitution.

Said Honor Court member
Burks in anticipation of the poll,
“If the students vote to retain
a dry campus, then they must
take a greater responsbiility in
maintaining it."

Council added that should the
student body delete its drinking
rule, the faculty will probably
take more stringent measures
to retain and enforce theirs.

Council announced that the
actual vote count on Tuesday's
poll was. 304-39 in favor of
changing the present rule mak-
ing Honor Court and Student
Council members honor bound
to report violations of the Stu-
dent ‘Body Regulations.

EQUAL RESPONSIBILITIES

Burks, questioned as to his
true motive for suggesting the

change, replied, “My purpose is
to equalize the responsibility for
upholding the Student Body Reg-
ulations.”’

Bob Bryan added: ‘‘The main
issue we are considering here

‘is thé fact that we do not con-

sider drinking an honor offense,
and therefore should not be
honor bound to report offenses
related to drinking."
VIET NAM

Council next presented a plan
originated by Pinckney Whitson
which would hopefully supply
10,000 copies of Playboy maga-
zine to U. S. soldiers in Viet
nam, The idea stemmed from
a letter in the magazines from
a soldier who complained that
there was a severe shortage of
copies in that area of the world.

Whitson contacted a Playboy
executive who said he could
probably procure the needed
supply if Whitson could find a
way to round them up. Then
Whitson must find a way to get
them to Marietta, Ga., where
a plane will fly them to Viet
Nam.

designated representatives of the college are participating.

The new amendments were
approved by a “good major-
ity.’ according to Rresident D.
Grier Martin. .

The amendments which were
added to the faculty approved
rule were the recomendations
of the joint Faculty-Trustee
Committee on Alcoholic Bever-
age Policy which had previously
been deleted from that commit-
tee's motion.

The organization of the com-
mittee itself was recommended
by the faculty on Dec, 8, 1964,
out the first meeting was held
on Aug. 20 of this year. It con-
sists of both trustees and faculty
with its members being appoint-
ed respectively by Dr. ‘J. Mc-
Dowell Richards. ‘president of
the Board of Trustees, and Pres-
ident Martin.

Representing the trustees are
D. R. LaFar Jr. and Dr. Thomas
G. Thurston. Faculty members
serving are Dr. W. G. Workman
and Dr. J. G. Martin. Both Rich-
ards and President Martin serve
as ex officio members. of the
joint. committee.

FRATERNITY PARTIES

The faculty amendments es-
sentially “take us back where
we were, except for fraternity
parties," commented Professor
Martin. “Groups having parties
will still have, to register, but
there is no prohibition on mod-
erate drinking.”

This new faculty action will
prohibit any drinking at college.
sponsored functions and func.
tions where designated represen-
tatives of. the college are partici-
pating. Also no drinking or trans-
porting of alcoholic beverages
will be allowed by a student
while he is participating as a
designated representative of the
school. ,

Professor Martin stated that
the reason the two recommenda-
tions had been deleted by pre-
vious faculty action was the
“concern had been raised only

in a casual way,"' and the com. |

mittee felt that the motions
“needed to have emphasis
placed on them.”

Concern over the deletion of
the two recommendations by the
previous faculty action came
from Dan Campbell, chairman
of the Social Council, and Coach
Heath Whittle. assistant direc-
tor of athletics.

Campbell has stuted for THE

pressure on the Social Council
to have parties for the student
body off campus where drinking
would have been allowed by the
action of the faculty in October.
Professor Martin said that
“the majority of students dis-
agree with Campbell.’ But the
committee felt that the com-
plaint issued by the president of
the Social Council should be
taken into consideration.
Professor Martin said that the
action of the faculty on Wednes-
day “reflects the. judgment of
the committee that students

representing the college should.
‘not consume alcohol.”

DISCIPLINE PROBLEM

“The coaches felt that they
could handle the discipline prob-
lem,"" Martin continued, “but
they were afraid of an unexpect-
ed situation arising in the fu.

ture."’

According to Martin, the facut-
ty action will do away with un-
necessary accidents on athletic-.
trips and “prevent loss of team
morale, and also. we need to
maintain the support of the pub-
lic."

The only confusing aspect of
the faculty ruling is the mean-
ing of a ‘‘designated represen-
tative of Davidson College.”

According to Richard C. Burts.
dean of students, the term “‘des-

ignated representative’ will
cover students in these in-
stances. 1) Students whose ex-

penses are being paid by the
college: 2) those selected by the
college to attend: 3) those whose
absences are excused by the col-
lege.- “I think these three will
cover it,"’ Burts concluded.

Dave Clark Five Presents Its Philosophy Of Life

By BILL SEIGLER and
KERN PARKER
Davidsonian Feature Writers

“The rock ’n roll craze? Oh it
will probably last for a long
time, but we won’t,’’ said Dave
Clark of England's famous Dave
Clark Five Sunday afternoon.

Mike Smith, the organist of the

group, agreed: ‘I should think
I'd be at least a retired old
gentleman by the time it ends.
They've been saying that it’s
dying for years, but it still keeps
going.”

The group was at the Char-
lotte Coliseum for a concert
sponsored by Hit Attractions,

Ine. Before the performance,
two DAVIDSONIAN reporters,
granted a special interview
with them, went backstage
with five excited teen age girls,
wipners in a ‘‘Meet the Dave
Clark Five’’ contest, who were
carrying a plum pudding to
their idols.

DAVE CLARK FIVE PAUSES FOR INTERVIEW
“We Got Together To Raise Money”

At least 5,000 other girls were
sitting outside, not-too-patiently
enduring the performance of
two lesser-known rock 'n roll
groups. Momentarily at a loss
for words, the two reporters
were soon put at ease by the
casual friendliness of the visit-
ors from England.

According to Clark, he, Smith.
Dennis Payton, Rick Huxley and
Lenny Davidson, decided to cash
in on the rock 'n roll boom 3%
years ago, after they had met
and become gond friend friends
in a North London athletic club.
Their motives were purely fin-
ancial. ‘‘We got together to raise
money,'’ stated Payton.

Clark said that on this tour
they planned to spend three
weeks in the U. S., appearing
in 21 different cities,

He admitted that. the tour was
a hard grind, but added, ‘We
still never get tired of it."

“That's true,’’ smiled Smith,
‘but I would enjoy it a lot more
if we, could stay in one place
for a while.”

When Clark was asked to what
extent his group had been in-
fluenced by the Beatles. he re-
plied, “Not at all. Our first hits
were on the charts at the same
time theirs were.”

He added that he enjoyed the
Beatles’ music, remarking that
Ringo is an ‘excellent drum-
mer.”

Denis Payton maintains that
they have no rivalry with the
Beatles, or with the Rolling
Stones either.

“I like both groups.”’ he said.
He did note, however, that the
sales of their new records com-
pared ‘‘well” with those of the
other two groups.

Clark stated that the group
wanted to make a movie in the
future. ‘But not like the Beatles’
movies. We want to play char-
acter parts. No songs,”

When Payton was asked to
what extent he thought their ap-
peal to teen-age girls depended
on their jong hair, he grinned,
“We haven't got long hair.”

When asked who did have long
hair, if they didn’t, he said, “Oh,
I'd have to think about that one
for a while. Some of the more
controversial groups, I guess."

All of them seemed to like
Charlotte and the United States
in general. Clark remarked that
he had enjoyed his stay in Char-
lotte last summer, and that he
