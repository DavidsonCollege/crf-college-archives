Ski bums prepare your gear for the season.

By JOHAN KINCK
Staff Correspondent

Ski season is finally within
sight. The weather is definitely
fall, and there has been some
snow in the mountains.This ‘is
the time to start bringing out
your equipment.

Your gear should be inspec-
ted long before the season so
that necessary repair and ad-
justments can be made. How
much you need to do all depends
on how you left your skis last
spring and how they have been
stored.

When you now pull out your
eight-months neglected equip-
ment, there are several things
that should be done before you
head for the slopes.

The bottom of your skis is a
petroleum base product that
will oxidize slowly if they are
not covered with wax. If your
skis have not been waxed since
the last trip they will need flat
filing and burning. Also a coat
of wax will not only help you ski
faster, but it also protects the
ski and reduces wear.

Unless you feel terrific about
your binding, there is no reason
to even think about skiing.
Your bindings are healthwise
the single most important part
of your equipment. They cannot
be checked often enough. By
checking I mean see if they
work,

The single wariable most re-
lated to bindings opening at a
safe load is, according to Dr.
Larry Young, whether the
mechanism has been opened
recently. Tommy Corcoran, an
ex-Olympic skier, when asked

Have your bindings
checked and set. by a profes-
sional at least once a year and
then pop them open once in a
while to make sure they work
right.

There is not much to say
about boots except keep them
dry and don’t walk too much in
them. This will wear down the
sole and result in a poor fit
against the binding. ~

There is on the market this
year, soles that can be strapped
on your boots to walk on, but I
do not know how well they
work.

I'd also like to say something
about poles. Not many people

North Carolina Slopes

Appalachian Ski Mountain is located between Boone and
Blowing Rock. The runs are short, the drop is 336 feet, but it is a
good place for beginners and intermediate skiers.

skiing. The drop is 809 feet. It has a tendency to be crowded on

weekends.

Cataloohee at Waynesville west of Asheville has slopes that are
fair. With more snowing equipment it would be a good place. The

drop is 740 feet.

Seven Devils on 105 South of Boone has good slopes especially
for intermediate skiers, and a drop of 607 feet. The weekend crowd
is much smaller than on Beech or Sugar.

Sugar Mountain on 184 before Banner Elk has nice, long runs.
It’s a good place for beginners and intermediate skiers with a 1200
foot drop. There are, however, long lift lines-on weekends.

Wolf Leuiled: near Mars Hill, is 25 miles north of Asheville. The
beginner runs are short but otherwise it’s a good hill. It is
inexpensive and not crowded. The drop is 700 feet.
