C.A. and Y.B. Return

CAPTAIN AMERICA
and
BUCKY

Hello, C.A. and Y.B. have
returned just in time to close
out the regulation IMAC B-
Ball season and talk about
tourney prospects.

In League A there were four
undefeated teams ied by pre-
season poll pick, the Hoboken
Snarks. With Jaun Sanchez,
Randy Wagner, Bobby
‘‘Weasel’’ Evans, Craig
“Destructo” Crosswhite and
the Big E, the Snarks are the
class of IMAC as their 6-0
record would indicate.

Wherever in the hell
Hoboken is they should be '74
IMAC champs.

Also undefeated for the
regular season were the aptly
named Qld Men. The
‘‘Geezers’’ (our own little pet
name) managed to chug past
their opposition with ex-
perience steady play and
referees who were _in-
timidaded by the professors
on the team.

Chip (the invisible man)
Stone and Jimmy ‘‘The
Greek"’ Larranaga led the
Goldie Oldies while the
realatively young Frank
‘*Foulball’’ Folger adding
some hustle and speed.
Foulball also is the IMAC
boxing champ with his one
punch TKO over Will McLean
in one of the Old Men - Brew
contests.

The third undefeated team
was the dark horse Cleveland
Indians Indians who squeaked
their way to a 6-0 slate. Three
of their victories were by a

total of 5 pts.

Because of the uncertainty
of the mental state of the star-
ting five and newcomers Tim
“traitor’’ Peck and Virgil
“‘mitey mite’’ Demery, the In-
dians are never a team to
Predict.

Who knows what they will do
from day to day? Mark
Rodgeman never knows.

The last undefeated team
was a sad story. Powerful
SAE No. 1, loaded with a great
talent in Peyton Prospere,
Tim Spencer, Jud Cuttino,
Eldon Bashar, and John
Yeoman, the E's cruised
through their 6-0 season.

But Prospere has decided
to leave school so the E’s are
not the great team they can be
anymore. They are still one
of the better teams in IMAC
however.

Other good teams in the
tourney are the always tough
Ghetto, led by Charles ‘‘Bom-
ber’’ Bethea, Derry Harper,
and Mike ‘‘Playground”’ Har-
ding; the infamous SPE’s with
two-time rag recipient John
‘‘Duke’”’ Sims; and the team of
no names - the Queen and 12
Very Nice Guys led by orange
jumping Jack Berrie and
the human beach ball who is

Tankers Soak UNC-A
Webbed By Richmond

By ANN BODE
Staff Writer

Davidson swimmers won
one and lost one in their meets
last week. On Tuesday they
hosted UNC at Asheville and
won by a score of 65-47.

Freshman Ted Mumby was
high point man with two first
places in the diving com-
petition.

John Scholer won the 200
freestyle event with a time of
1:59.6, the first time he has
gone under two minutes for
the event. John McArthur took
second place in that race.

In two other races Davidson
totally dominated, taking both
first and second places: 50
yard free-first place Eliasson
(24.5), second place Alford;
and 220-yard back - first place
Doscher (2:25.6), second place
Susan Reid.

On Saturday, Davidson lost
to a much stronger Un-

iversity of Richmond team
by a score of 64-46.

Team captain Scholer broke
the school record in the 1000-

yard free with a time of

Scholer just missed placing
first in the 500-yard freestyle.
He lost by two-tenths of a
second.

John McArthur was high
scorer in this meet for David-
son. He placed first in the 50-
yard free with a time of 23.5
and did his best time, placing
second in the 100-yard free
with a 52.4.

The only other first place
for Davidson was Doscher in
the 200-yard backstroke with a
time of 2:18.9.

Coach Tom Stevens was
pleased with the times turned
in by Scholer, McArthur,
Owens, Doscher and Reid.

He is trying to get Reid
qualified for the Women's
Collegiate National Swim-
ming Championships.

On Wednesday the team
travels to Augusta for their
second away meet of the
season.

The nexthome meet will be
next Wed., Feb. 6 when David-
son hosts Emory at 1:30 p.m.
Foliowing the meet, at 4, there
will be a Drownproofing Clinic
run by the Emory team.

The Delts win this year’s
“Stack the standings” award
with approximately 8 teams in
both leagues.

PDT No. 3 is 5-0. With only
five men each, 3 of whom
averaged 8 points a game,

these studs have done an ex-
ceptional job and deserve a
big hand.

SAE is runner up with
possibly the worst IMAC team
ever to be seen in Johnston
Gym. Appropriately named
the Goneds, this team does
belong in the lower ex-
tremities of something.

Coach of the year goes to
Snow White of the 7 dwarfs.
Although the team lacks talent
(no one over 5'11’’) they have
a hell of a time during time
outs and at halftime, with the
coach.

Since we have to fill up a
page and this is supposed to be
an intramural column, our
only news of the week con-
cerns a tragedy involving the
SPE’s. Something involving
some type of ‘‘early rush’’, we
believe he said. Oh well, who
cares.

May you always match,
and may Monte Carlo turn it-
self over.
