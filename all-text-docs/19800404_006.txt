Nader centered his remarks
on what college students can do
in society, how they can be
educated consumers and how
they can foster good consumer-
ism. According to Nader, in-
formed and organized consum-

ers can resist_price Banal

unethical corporate practices
and harmful business policies.
The ultimate aim of business
should be to benefit the con-
sumer, he asserted, but only by
overcoming the wasteful and
inefficient practices of business
can this end be realized.
Obviously addressing the col-

lege students in the audience,
Nader called for college research
aimed at protecting the con-
sumer. ‘Most students, Nader
said, respond to college work
with “fear and boredom,” but

that this research should be
spurred by a sense of injustice.
Too many people, he stated,
have rationalized immoral prac-

Nader then turned to the
broader subject of consumerism
and said that the principle of
consumerism should rest on an
ancient Roman proverb: What-
ever touches all should be
decided by all. Unfortunately,
he said, consumers will be
controlled by business if they
allow it. The purpose of govern-
ment is to open up the process
and allow for more consumer
input. Student research could
facilitate this, he added, citing
his own law school research in

Harris & Wilson plan management
seminar for serious students

Staff Writer.
Davidson students Jeff Har-
ris and Bill Wilson, in conjunc-
tion with the pre-management
committee, have organized a
management seminar for any-
one interested i in business car-

eers. ih tre, at

small group disucssions, léader-
ship simulations, and business
exercises focusing on the topic

of “Managing for Productivity-

in the 1980s.”
Wilson and Harris are enthu-

siastic about this year’s semi-

nar. Herris points to ‘‘the
wealth of personal experience”
which the managers will be
sharing with the students; Wil-

“son. feels the benefit lies in the
fact that “the students will be

requirements. Citizens must
assert an “it’s my body’’ atti-
tude and demand proper service
or be prepared to accept their
position as an abused consum-
er, Nader said.

Nader spoke out in defense of
NC-PIRG. Nader noted that

- PIRG research is both “‘intel-

lectually demanding”’ and effec-
tive, citing the organization's
role in the passing of ‘North
Carolina’s generic drug law,
which will save North Carolina
consumers $6% million this
year.

Nader indirectly criticized the
decision made by College Presi-
dent Samuel Spencer last sum-
mer and confirmed by a student
referendum this fall to discon-
tinue funding PIRG through
the ‘‘negative check-off sys-
tem.” With this system, the $4
fee to support PIRG was in-
cluded in the comprehensive
student fee. Those who did not
wish to pay deducted $4. Nader
called this negative check-off
system “‘the much more demo-
cratic approach’’ and asked
students to reconsider their
support.

After concluding his plug for
Davidson's chapter of NC-
PIRG, Nader directed his com-
ments to North Carolina’s na-
tional congressmen and their
records on consumer legislation.
He classified them as ‘‘abys-
mal,” partly due to a lack of
grassroots pressure. According

’ to Nader, Ninth District Con-

gressman Jim Martin voted in
the interests of consumers only
8% of the time in 1979 and
backed the oil industry interests
on all nine of the major energy
bills he voted on last year. In
addition, Nader attacked North
Carolina Senators Helms and
Morgan, as well as Martin, for

to make‘it better for all.

Next year’s resident advisors will
have greater duties, smaller fees

By ANTHONY EVERMAN
Staff Writer

Beginning next year, two
resident advisors will replace
each house manager in Little,
Watts, Cannon, and Sentelle
dormitories. The changeover
will spread to other dorms in
subsequent years.

The responsibilities of the
resident advisors will be wider
than those of the house mana-
gers. The resident advisors will
be responsible for checking
students in and out at the
beginning and end of each year..
They will also be available for
reference and for organizing
certain as of yet unspecified
activities for the dorms. In
addition, they will also sit on
the Resident Hall Council which
concerns itself with dorm mat-
ters.

The resident advisors will
undergo a more extensive train-

in program than the house
managers have had, and will be
given half of room fees plus the
set fee given to both resident
advisors and house managers.

Bolding supported the
change, stating, ‘‘We are pro-
viding for the needs of the
people in dorms. It is also more
consistent with the programs at
other colleges.””

Next year’s resident advisors
are: In Little, David Rhodes
and John Boswell; in Watts,
Bill Dascombe and John
Chung; in Cannon, Julie Weber
and Annie Guerard; and in
Sentelle, Keith Hearle and
Bruce Wallace.

House managers for the other
three dorms have also been
appointed—Rick Gergoudis in
Duke, Frank Clark and John
Teague in Belk, and Barbara
Boyce in Richardson.

Town Community Center begins

bartering program for services

By JEFF DEMPSEY
Staff Correspondent

The Davidson Community
Center has recently begun a
service program in which com-
munity members help each
other by exchanging services.
This Bartering Program invol-
ves the establishment of-a file
box at the Community Center
where anyone desiring to parti-
cipate may fill out a card
indicating what services he has
to offer and ‘what services he
would like in return.

The services can’ be any odd
job or skill ranging from pain-
ting to bookkeeping to teaching
piano to offering a ride. They
may be a one afternoon job or a

task spread out over several |

weeks. The details are to be

worked out between individuals

after initial contact is made

through this program.

For students who wish to put
a card on file, a sign-up sheet
has been placed at the Union
desk along with a list of
suggestions for services that
can ‘be traded. All entries on
this shéet will be put on cards
and placed in the file box at the
Community Center. Groups
such as freshman halls, eating

_ houses, and ‘‘small groups,” as

well as individuals, can place a

_ card on file since many jobs are
