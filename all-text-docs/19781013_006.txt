Intemational students

‘seek cultural exchange

By ALLISON LEWIS

What is there”to do at

Davidson College for the stu- .

dent whose main concern is not
academic pursuit?

This is the dilemma facing
many ‘of the international stu-
dents, who came to Davidson,
as Chris Chedwick (England)
stated, for more of a “cultural
exchange than academic.”

Most of the nine international
students have completed or
almost completed their studies
in their own country and were
selected to receive scholarships _
to Davidson after facing stiff —
competition from fellow stu-
dents. -

Seema Hanafi (Pakistan) has
earned her bachelors degree
from a Pakistinian university
and considers her year at Da-
vidson a “stepping-stond’’ to-
ward earning her Masfers de-
gree in the United States.
Francoise Cougnenc (France)
has earned her bachelors degree

in France and plans to train as a -

bilingual secretary next year.
All of the other students have
completed at least one year of
education in their respective
countries.

Thomas Weitz (Germany)
states that he is ‘‘not here to
study. I can do that in Europe.
I came here for the social
exchange. This is the reason we

are only taking two courses.”’
Weitz feele that the college
has not done enough toward
helping the students see more of
America than just the “isala-

ted’ community of Davidson,,.

According to the students, it is
difficult to find transportation
for weekend outings and be-
tween-term breaks.

The college did provide a car
for a trip to Winston-Salem last
week. Chadwick, however, com-

mented that the car was very

difficult to obtain. He suggests
that the college should give the

_international students priority —

on one of the college cars.
Weitz thinke the college

ought to coordinate more ven- .

tures for the students, noting
that the international students

“are not always aware of the

opportunities that are available.

Not all the international stu-
dents share these sentiments,
however in the opinion of Ja-
nette OkombA (Kenya), “it is
too much to expect the college

‘to plan every little outing.’ She

believes that Davidson has_
given her the opportunity to
come and establish friendships
and that “‘life cannot be,planned
to the last detail.

“We (the international stu-
‘dents) need to realize the need
for initiative.”

Hanafi stated that while

“none of us were prepared for

Davidson to be so isolated” the
office for international students
has ‘“‘really been looking out for
us well.”

Roberto Gonzales-vera
(Spain) commented that he does:
not feel isolated; he added that
early-year coordination pro-
blems in the international stu-
dent office seem to be solved,
and said the college -is now
offering more concerts, dramas,
and other activities than he can
attend. Cougnenc observed
that it is too early in the year to

have made any really close
friends, but that living on a
small campus increases the
opportunity to meet people.

Cheetu Iyer (India) says that
he did not expect Davidson to
be like all of America when he —
came here. Iyer plans to travel
in America after his year at
Davidson.

While all of the students say
they believe that they are
benefiting from their year at
Davidson, some remark that
the American education system
is more structured than they

All too often, Okomba feels,
there is not enough room for
self-initiative. ‘‘Lectures take
the student’s hand and guide
him along’ and too many
students seem to be “content to
take the professor's guide-
lines.”’

The exchange of student
ideas does not play as big a role
in the Davidson classroom as in
Germany, where most universi-
ty courses are conducted as~
seminars, Weitz explained. *

In the view of Nobus Sekido
(Japan) Davidson takes care of
‘the students more than at his _
Japanese university where the .
students are not given any
guidance by faculty advisors
and are expected to find things
out for themselves.

Despite whatever shortcom-
ings the international students
feel that Davidson College may
have, they all expressed grati-
tude at being given the oppor-

. tunity to study in America and

for the friendliness shown them
by the other Davidson stu-
dents.

‘Every corner you turn,”
states Okomba, ‘‘there is a
smile waiting for you.”
