Scotsman In Jamaica

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Assistant Managing Editor

‘What in the name of for-
tune induced you to choose a
place like this for a school?”
said an old Scotsman as he
looked at the area proposed by
Lewis Davidson for the groun-
dbreaking of Knox College.
“It’s all rockstone and
brush!”

The Scotsman’s incredulity
is a normal reaction to the
Reverend Davidson, a man
who makes things work where
they apparently cannot.

Davidson answered the
Scotsman and others with less
fore-sight and faith than he by
saying: ‘“There was a sense of
destiny about the place and a
job to be done. That was the
reason, there was a job to be
done!”’

Davidson, who will speak
here on Tuesday, April 2, was
educated in Scotland at the
University of Edinburgh, as a
contemporary of Warner Hall,
chairman of the Davidson
College Board of Trustees.

Once out of school, Davidson
accepted the headmastership
at Wolmer’s Boy’s School in
Kingston Jamaica. This
school is the oldest school in
the West Indies, founded in
1725.

‘I was given a list of clothes
I would require for my jour-
ney to and life at Wolmer’s. It
included 24 dress shirts, two
sets of evening clothes, and
one of tails. This in a way
suggested the stuffed-shirt at-
mosphere of the education to
which I was going,” said
Davidson.

“I stayed there for a few
years and then I felt that I had
to do something a little more
practical and to work on
closer terms with the
Jamaican friends that I had
made and so I offered myself
as a missionary of the Church
of Scotland and was very glad
when they gave me a chance
to serve.”’

After a series of government
loans sent Davidson to two
struggling schools, he retur-
ned to the job he really wanted
to do.

“I wanted to find out how
Jamaicans lived, to learn
about their homelife, their
homes, and staying there, get-
ting to know folklore, the
songs, the dances, and par-
ticularly to get to know them.

In 1945, Davidson, acting on
faith, recommended in a
report to the Presbyterian
Church in Jamaica that the
Church should build an
education center in rural
Jamaica.

In 1946, The Church of
Scotland recognized a request
from the Synod of Jamaica for
a rural education center and
appointed Davidson as its first
principal.

Davidson was thankful for
the appointment but he said,
“As happens with so many
missionaries, I was given the
chance, but no money.”’

Starting with $1000 con-
tributed by Presbyterian
pastors in Jamaica, Davidson
began to buy land in
Spaulding’s county, Jamaica.
He describes it as, ‘‘land in the

mountains of Jamaica 3000
feet up in a glorious climate
where the sun shines without
the cruel heat of the sun.”
Only birds flew and goats ate
untethered cropped bitter
grass.

Because of the remoteness
of ’s Hill, it was ex-
tremely to bring inthe
necessary materials.

Kingston and help build the
school.

Davidson said, ‘‘Road
building had to be job number
one; for nothing that wouldn’t
hold on the back of a donkey
could get up that hill. Dave
built the road, a good one that
has taken the subsequent
years of pounding very well.

“It was not paved in the
beginning, and much of the
hill remained treacherous.
You could even without trying,
skid from top to bottom on wet
days. Ladies, male and
female, preferred to stay
home on days when the red
dirt shone like cardinal

“As we began building our

school, we found that as we

another dormitory.

‘This opened my eyes to the
possibilities of training people
to work, to learn, to support
themselves. There were many
experiments in this field.

“IT had been to Cadbury’s in |

England and had seen many
young women, white clad,
making candies. Why not in

‘at any Tom, Dick or Harry
and keep themselves ‘pure,
and they look not for a boy-
friend but for a man who will
marry them. ”

Davidson said that his group
could maufacture as much as
300 pounds a week, but it got to
the point where ‘‘We could do
no more on charcoal pots. It
was at that point that my faith
faltered, and stunned as it
were, by the of the
task, gave up. I keep that little
candy shop under the girl’s
hostel still to remind me to
never give up again.”’

With the failure of the candy
shop went the school’s income
and the jobs it provided. It was
then that another very won-
derful thing happened. Dan
Davidson, of the Covenant
Presbyterian in Charlotte sent
Knox a_ small printing
machine.

Davidson vowed not to give
up on the new source of money
and work, although he knew
very little about the printing
trade. He is a man miraculous
in many ways, one of them
being that he is not afraid of
learning anything.

He set about to learn the
printing trade and to solicite

polish.”’

With the new road, building
began. Davidson says about
this portion of the project,
“The Israelites had to make
bricks without straw, we had
to without water.” Indeed, the
nearest water was five miles
away. A water hole was dug,
but it was a slow process in the
solid rock of Spaulding’s Hill.

“For months we waited for
rain to fall on our catchment.
It was one of the happiest days
in my life when the rain came
on the day we finished the gut-
tering.”’ said Davidson.

Through all the difficulties,
the building went on as long as
there was money. It came in
‘marvellous ways. Mrs. Duthie
Webster, a woman from Aber-
deenshire, Scotland gave
$10,000

One old lady in the area of

Jamaica where we have the
sugar, the fruits and the
chocolate? And I thought of
our own Jamaicans girls with
so few opportunities.

“The idea was that by using
machines and technological
know-how dedicated to the
cause of Christ we can enable

pool to stand on their
own feet

Davidson continued, ‘‘I have
seen for a long time the spec-
tacle, for instance, of our girls
who are under tremendous
pressure from the men folks to
produce their babies at 13 or 14
years of age.

“I have found that girls,
when they got training and
keep themselves neat and tidy
and work with dignity, when
they receive an adequate
reward for their labors, are
not going to throw themselves

help in any way he could in or-
der to make the new en-
terprize work.

Said Davidson: ‘‘We needed
service such as the man out of
Chicago who owned his own
lirlotype setting business and
as a good Presbyterian gave
up six months of his life to
‘come down and teach our boys
to do linotype work.”’

Knox Educational Services,
which began with the gift of a
printing machine, is now self-
supportive and will soon reach
a level of earnings and savings
that ‘‘is equivalent to an en-
dowment of a quarter of a
million dollars,’ according to
Davidson.

With the money and the
renewed faith, the school con-
tinued and continues today
with an enrollment of nearly
500 truly international studen-

¥

ts. Said Davidson, “‘We have a
fine school of young people,
many of whom are French

from Haiti, Spanish
spzaking from Cuba and
Venezuel; young Americans
from the South all the way nor-
th through New York; Danes
and Dutch from the oil fields
in Aruba.

“Along side of our develop-
ment of the schools for
children five to eight, we have
a junior school for children
eight to 11 and what you would
call a high school for 11 to 18.
The academic standards are
very high and many of our
students go to universities and
schools of technology
abroad.”’

Davidson is no longer prin-
cipal at Knox, but has
assumed the position of Direc-
tor of the Knox Development
Fund. It is his goal now, as it
has been to help his friends the
Jamaican people. Knox
College offers a good
academic program with most
of the teachers being native
Jamaicans.

It is a consequence of their
upbringing in a basically un-
derdeveloped country,
however, that dictates that
these teachers teach in the
humanities. Few qualified
teachers of science and
mathematics exist in rural
Jamaica.

Davidson would like to work
out a program for Davidson
College students to teach some
basic mathematics and work
ostensibly with the
technological advancement of
the area of Spaulding’s Hill.

The Davidson student would
design his own textbook
because few exist in the depar-
tment of the sciences. This
would necessitate some
library research.

Also requiring some research
is the general development
project for Knox. The roofing,
aluminum on wood, that they
now use is expensive. A new
and less expensive roof is
needed at the school and in
Jamaica.

There is interest in methane
technology and plans are
needed to build a methane
generator. These are things
that students could do.

There is a_ problem,
however, now with housing
any interested students who
might be willing to teach
and/or research in Jamaica.
‘For this need, Davidson
College is trying to raise $3000
to be used in building dor-
mitories.

Davidson will be here next
week and will speak at DCPC
Tuesday at 7 p.m. The rest of

-his time will be spent with in-

terested groups. These

meetings are being
by Director of Career/Service
Randall R. Kincaid. Davidson
will speak with ble volun-
teers after talk on
Tuesday.

Davidson has worked his
ministry almost entirely in a

-non-parish situation. He has

‘seen a human need in Jamaica
and answered it. Rush Otey
has suggested that his work is
