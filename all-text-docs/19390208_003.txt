Question

of the Week

Question: Are you in favor of the
present thod of lecting the
winner of the Southern Conference
Basketball Championship?

Jack Abernathy, Junior:

I think that the champions should
be determined by the conference
standing at the end of the season.
I think that the tournament should
continue

because it is a colorful
and entertaining affair. When the
winner is determined by its~ con-
ference standing it is more likely
that the best team will win.
Roy Cunningham, Sophomore:

I think that the winner should
be selected by its conference stand-
ing due to the fact that a true
standing cannot be obtained in the
hurry and turmoil of a tourney. I
think that the tournament is a
good thing but the winner should
receive a cup or trophy instead of
the title.

Tom Mullen, Senior:

in favor of selecting the
team by the tournament method as
like this method as

I am

it has the
draw interest as being an actual-
contest at the moment. It gives a
team that might have had a lower
standing during the year, because

does

of numerous reasons, a chance to
show its real calibre. I also believe
that it creates more interest in the
basketball season.

Norman Stevenson, Sophomore:

I think that the tournament is
a colorful event and makes the sea-
son more spectacular but it is not
as accurate as taking the total wins
and losses during the season. A
team that barely got in the tourney
might win while the team that won
the most games and lost less might
have an off day. Therefore I think
that the winner should be selected
by its conference standing at the
end of the year.

Davis Thomas, Freshman:

I think that it is fairer to select
the standing in the
conference at the end of the sea-
son because some team might have
an off-day in the tourney and be
defeated whereas they were really
a better team than the one who
won. Some arrangement ought to
be made whereas each member of

team by its

the conference should play every
other team at least once, and the
winner be determined by percent-
age.

Bill Telford, Senior:

I am in favor of the present
system because the teams which
might have made a good record by
playing easier schedules, when they
meet in the conference are given
a chance to display their talents
in competition with teams which
have played a harder schedule and
as a result have not such a good
record. The conference football
race is a good example of why the
other method should not be used,
because there particularly a team
which does not play many confer-
ence teams and has happened to
make a good record against those
few can and.does claim the champ-
ionship of the whole conference.

Define Prayer

An attempt was made to define
prayer at the beginning of the
meeting. After much discussion,
prayer was finally defined as “the
soul's sincere desire.” However this
definition was further limited to ex-
clude all prayer not
prayed to God,

The remainder of the meeting was
spent in a study of the Lord's
Prayer. Rev. Wiley said that this
great prayer should be the model
prayer of all Christians. It
found that the of the
Lord’s Prayer arranged in
the order of importance. A number
of helpful suggestions as to the
methods and nature of prayer were
given.
