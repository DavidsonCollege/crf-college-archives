THE BIBLE AS LITERATURE.
Macaulay
The English Bible, a book, which,
if everything else in our language
should perish, would alone suffice
to show the whole extent of its
beauty and power.

held in both societies. The Eu debate

INTER-RACIAL PROBLEMS

grievances from the negro’s point of
view. First is inequality of economic
opportunity. He told of negroes not
being given proper chances in industry
and of frequently receiving unequal pay .
for equal services rendered. Second, is
unequal railroad accommodations. He
spoke of the lack of room and of the
unhealthy conditions allowed in the
negro coaches.

The negro holds his destiny in his own
hands, the speaker said, and he told his
hearers that he teaches his students that
right living by them will do much to
solve the race problems, and that it is
worth infinitely more to make good use

THE PARABLE OF THE DUCK.

Have you ever heard of a duck that
could not swim? No? Well, this duck,
like many other ducks now-a-days, was
born in an incubator, but was not al-
lowed to go near the water. After he
became a grown-up duck, he found him-
self in the middle of a pond, but— He
nearly drowned.

That is a funny opening, isu’t it? The
point is this: We must either use or
lose our instincts. Every man on Da-
vidson campus has a sense of justice, of
kindness, or you may say a religious
instinct. '

Once a week we have an opportunity
to develop this highest of all instincts.
Last Sunday morning 12 Bible classes
were conspicuous by their lack of in-
terest, and 270 fellows were a little for-
‘getful about the time of meeting.
and “Jim” McKeldin is back of this heart

and soul. Can't the rest of the fellows

WATCHES, CLOCKS and JEWELRY|pR. RICHARDS PREACHES ON
Full Line of Pennants THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.

W. S. HENDERSON, Jeweer| Dr. C. M. Richards spoke Sunday

morning on the Tree of Knowledge or
Davidson, N. C. the Testing Tree, and the Tree of Life.
The Testing Tree proves the test of wil-
lingness and of disobedience. The Tree
of Life represents the Eternal Life as
Christ said, “To him that overcometh
I will give to eat of the Tree of Life
which is in the midst of the garden”

“The Tree of Knowledge,” Dr. Rich-
ards said, “was nothing more than the
test of willingness by God. There was
no sin or immorality concerned with it.
Satan, an outside power, hostile to God
and man, caused the disobedience of
mankind, and thus made it a “Tree of
Temptation.” God makes it a test; Satan
makes it temptation.

And he said, furthermore, “Go where
you will, do what you may, live alone —
in the garden of life there will always
be this Tree in the midst where Catan
is seducing mankind.”
| The fool will take the easiest way and
that to destruction. The wise man, un-
derstanding that every bite of the for-
bidden fruit is taking away a littie bit
of good, pure and heavenly part of the
heart. On the other hand it is adding
a little more malicious, impure and devil-
ish food for the soul.

The reason why we should not cat of
the forbidden fruit is that we can’t have
both. Also Christ said, “To the one who
fought and overcame, to him will I give
to eat of the Tree of Life which is in
the midst of the garden.”

DEPUTATION WORK OF VOL-
UNTEER BAND NOW WELL
UNDER WAY.

Four Churches of Concord Presby-
tery Visited by Students Last
Sunday—Other Appoint-

. ments

‘

Under the able direction of Rolston
Bitzer the deputation work of the Stu-
dent Volunteer Band is having a note-
worthy success. The number of depu-
tations being sent out is on the increase,
and extensive plans are being made for
the future. On Sunday just past two
deputations visited neighboring fields,
the first consisting of “Mac” Richards
and Baba, the second of “Ed” Cunning-
ham and “Ted” Jones.

“Mac” and Baba went to Concord, N.
C., where they. were given a most cor-
dial reception. Sunday morning they
spoke at the Second Presbyterian
Church before an audience of approxi-
mately 150; Sunday evening at Bayliss
Memorial Church to about 75. “Mac”
discussed the need of the world for more
missionaries, and Baba applied this need
to a particular country—Persia. Many
persons showed their interest by talk-
ing with the fellows after the service,
and literature taken along for the pur-
pose was given those desiring it.

The second deputation, made up of
“Ed” Cunningham and “Ted” Jones, vis-
ited the Back Creek and Thyatira
Churches, about 10 miles above Salis-
bury. About 200 were in attendance at
Back Creek Sunday morning, and about
goo at Thyatira Sunday afternoon. “Ed”
spoke of the needs of the foreign fields
along all lines; “Ted” Jones on “Con-
secration for Service,” taking up the
questions Who? How? and Why? Great
interest was manifested at both places,
and one person volunteered for a life
of Christian service.

Next week “Buck” Curry and “Bill”
Crane are going to Charlotte to speak at
the Tenth Avenue Presbyterian Church
and at the Pegram Street Church, and
it is hoped: that they can accomplish
much by their visit.

PRELIMINARIES FOR INTER-
COLLEGIATE DEBATES
WILL BE HELD TO-
MORROW.

The preliminaries of the intercollegi-
ate debates with Mercer and Wake For-
est will be held in the respective society
halls Friday, the 18th. Four men will be
selected from each society to speak in
the finals when four principals and two
alternates will be selected.

The subject used will be, “Resolved,
That the United States should cancel
the war debts of the Allies.” This sub-
ject will be used in the debate with
Wake Forest, Davidson having the af-
firmative side of the question. Mercer
has not selected the subject she wishes
in our debate with her.

Among those who are out for this de-
bate are Mitchell, Ormond, A. P., Boul-
ware and Bitzer, for the “Eus,” and
Dunlap, Roberts, Flynn and Chal Long,
and Clark, for the Phis. The men who
made the teams last fall have been de-
clared ineligible for places in this con-
test.

men and women for the future, better
homes in which to train those boys and
girls, and Christ in the fathers and
mothers, that they may teach their chil-.
dren aright. When we get closer to
God then and then only will men get
right with each other,

The large attendance was an indica-
tion of the interest manifested in the
meeting, and no one was disappointed.

The same question was debated in the

The affirmative was represented by
three Freshmen, W. Z. Bradford, A. S.
Mcllwaine and E. N. Peeler. The neg-
ative was represented by two Sopho-
mores, M. P. Calhoun and L. P. Burney.
The debaters showed thorough prepara-
