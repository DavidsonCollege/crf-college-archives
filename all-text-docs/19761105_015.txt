Wildcat Clu

By MARK SCANDLING

Davidson College actively
seeks private donations to
maintain the high standards of

its programs. One of the ~

programs which depends hea-
vily on private donations is
the intercollegiate athletic
program.

An enormous amount of
money is needed to run the
athletic department, and the
College cannot foot the bill
alone.

After graduation, every al-
umnus. will be asked to share
in the cost of running the
athletic program. The Wildcat
Club is the organization which
will solicit these donations.

Before donating, everyone
should know where and how
their money will be spent.

A popular misconception of
the Wildcat Club is that it
exists solely to support the
football team.

On the contrary, the pur-
pose of the Wildcat Club as
laid down in 1973 by a
trustee’s decision is ‘“‘to sup-
plement the functioning of the
entire intercollegiate athletic
program.

This was the original pur-
pose when the club was foun-
ded in 1950. It began as a
loosely organized athletic boo-
ster club. Volunteers run the
club, and there were no mem-
bership fees.

In 1966 the club began to
take on a more. structural
form. Dues were charged and
the membership began to rise.
Nevertheless, the emphasis
was still on supporting all the
sports.

The nature of the Wildcat
Club changed in 1970. A
professional executive director
was hired to direct the raising
of money, in order to provide
football scholarships.

This was a result of trus-
tees’ decision that the football
program could remain at its
competitive level (1969 South-
ern Conference Champions),
but the “primary responsibil-

ity for funding the program
must come from alumni and
friends.”

Thus, from 1970-72 football
was the club's main concern.

The current executive direc-
tor, Mr. Sandy Carnegie,
came to Davidson in Febru-
ary, 1972. At that time he felt
it was apparent that the
“Wildcat Club needed to get
back to its original purpose,
which was to help all the
sports.

He devised a plan with Dave
Fagg, who was then head
football coach, whereby some
of the scholarship funds would

be channelled into the other .

sports.

This move preceded the
‘trustees’ mandatory decision
to fund all sports by several
months.

Today the Wildcat Club has
over 1,700 members, and that
number is growing rapidly.
Carnegie feels that the money
raised by these members
should be used to support all
the sports.

However, he strongly feels
that a good football program
and a top-20 basketball pro-
gram will be important to the
growth of the other sports.

If successful, these pro-
grams will bring in the money
needed to upgrade the quality
of all the teams. Carnegie also
added that ‘We only raise the
money, the athletic director
and coaches decide how to
spend it.”

Some of the more visible
expenditures made possible by
the Wildcat Club have been

_the new all-weather track, the

court, the purchase of new
weights, and the purchase of
several vans, which are used
to transport the teams to away
events.

The club also works in less
publicized ways.

Two years ago it helped
fund the soccer team’s trip to
England. Last year it pro-
vided financial aid to a foreign
tennis player and a soccer
