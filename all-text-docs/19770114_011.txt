Mussolini marches onward to print

Mussolini’s Roman Empire
The Viking Press, N.Y., 321 pp.

Benito Mussolini will appear in any
cursory history of the Second World
War. Mussolini was the man who led
the Italians into the war, as well as
into Ethiopia, Albania, Spain, North
Africa, and Greece in the hopes of
creating a second Roman Empire.

He lost them all, most before the
Allies landed in Sicily in 1943. In the
process he also became the very junior
partner in the Axis alliance and.came
close to ruining Italy economically.
So close, in fact, that the country is
still recovering from it, with not much
chance to do so in the near future.

Denis Mack Smith has chronicled
Mussolini’s personal progress during
his twenty years in power, showing
how it was Mussolini more than
anyone else who was responsible for
the Italian disaster. In a straight-
forward and sympathetic study, he
traces the ‘‘Duce’s’’—and necessarily
Italian Fascism’s—progress from
1922 to 1943.

Smith portrays Mussolini as suffi-
ciently intelligent and a master of
inflated propaganda. He makes clear,
however, that the Italian dictator
was, by no stretch of the imagination
an effective leader.

Mussolini, says Smith, systematic-
ally tried, via bombast and alternate
treats and promises, to walk the fine
line between the democracies and

Hitler. In so doing, he painted himself :

into the Axis via blatant*violations of
treaties, contradictory public state-
ments, and ignorance of realities.
Love of drama and propaganda
seems to have led Mussolini to believe

that he could make complex military
and economic decisions on the spur of
the moment, with neither consulta-
tion nor serious consideration. At one
time Mussolini controlled seven mini-
stries personally, none of which
operated efficiently under his lack of
direction. The result of this, as Smith
shows, was complete chaos, corrup-
tion, and continued destructive flat-
tery. These have obvious effects on
the Italian war effort.

Smith gives the Fascist bureau-
cracy surrounding Mussolini full cre-
dit for ineptitude also. He portrays
the power of Fascism in Italy as such
that keeping one’s job was a direct
function of flattering one’s superiors.

The results of this were exactly
what might be expected. The Govern-
ment gloried in the new colonies and
sent corrupt officials to Albania and
Africa. The military fell into disre-
pair, despite Mussolini’s continual
assurances that Italy was the most
powerful country in Europe. And the
balance of payments deficit rose to
the point where Italy was exporting
as much as thirty times its imports to
the colonies.

Smith’s account of Mussolini’s
relations with Hitler is incisive and
fascinating. Smith effectively shows
how the first of the fascist dictators
became a lackey to the cause of
National Socialism through his own
refusal to use interpreters, his braga-
doccio, and his fixed conviction that
he was a better leader than Hitler.

In addition, Smith recounts de-
mands for impossible amounts of raw
materials from Germany, and of
condescending attitudes and lack of
communication between the dicta-
tors; not to mention’the loss ‘of one
‘third of Italy’s:‘merchant navy at the
outset of Italy’s attack on France due
to internment in neutral ports.

Smith ends his account in the

middle of the war, but makes it clear
that there was nowhere for Mussolini
—or Italy—to go but down. The
conclusion leaves one with a feeling
for the painful absurdity of modern

Roommates poo! wit

By MERIDETH DURDEN

With a wine glass full of coke
resting on his stomach, Tom Niblock
sat floating in his indoor swimming
pool discussing the ‘‘ultimate dorm
room’’ that he and Biff Umhau
created together. '

Aiming for what was the ‘‘ultimate
dorm room’’, Niblock and his room-
mate Biff Umhau built a swimming
pool in their room. The sophomore
says, ‘‘We roomed together freshman
year and at that time we considered
building a fireplace or a balcony sun
porch. But the fireplace was against
all regulations and the porch could
only be used during certain months.
Besides, the sun doesn’t shine on this
side of Belk. So we settled for two
stories and this pool.”

Biff Umhau, who concedes that he
is an ‘‘amateur builder’, constructed
the prefabricated part of the frame
during summer. The pool measures,
as Biff proved with a ruler, 8 feet
long, 3 feet wide, and 3% feet deep. It
takes an hour to fill it with warm
water from the sink.

Insulated with three layers of poly-
ethelene, it has never leaked down
into the ROTC department, not even
when the ice machine in Watts was
emptied into it and Biff was thrown
into the icy water for his birthday.

‘It’s great to relax and read in
here,’’ Tom said while sipping his
Coke.

iii says. fre described how they
moved their beds out end spent the
day in the woods gathering logs and
greenery. ‘‘We put the bed frames up
against the wall and stuck branches
into them. And after painting black
light stars on the ceiling, we hung
branches from there also. It was so
thick that our guests couldn’t touch

Italy’s situation. Five thousand Ital-
ian sharpshooters put three holes in
Mussolini, goes the joke, but Musso-
lini did them one better. He sank
himself.

the wall from three feet away and they
had to push aside branches to reach
the clearing in the middle of the
room.”’

In the clearing there was a campfire
surrounded by sitting logs. There,
over a Sterno flame, they held a
weenie and marshmallow roast. That
night, with the tape recording of
crickets still playing, Biff and Tom
camped out in sleeping bags on the
floor. ‘‘We had no choice,’’ Biff
laughed, ‘‘We didn’t want to clean it
all up.”

What comes next? Tom, still
relaxing in the pool, spoke of a
massive keg party and wonders how
many kegs it would take to fill the
pool. Biff got out his calculator and
started figuring it out.

‘‘But if someone wanted to get
exercise, it would only take 891 laps
to swim a mile,” Biff adds.

The pool is the focal point of the
first level with its fountain and shell
decorations. Upstairs are the beds,
spotlighted along with the stereo by
alternating red and blue lights.
Totally self-supported, this second
story is three times as large as a
normal loft. At one end is a view of
the pool through hanging plants.
Potted bamboo, hanging strings of
shells, and Indonesian batiks high-
light other areas of the room.

When questioned about the wine
and cocktail glasses that litter the
room, Biff explained that they had a
poolside party the night before. He
went on to tell of last year’s parties
held in their room on first Cannon. He
and Tom built a platform and
replaced the chandelier with strobe
lights for a disco party. For Hallo-
ween they fashioned a Haunted
House, complete with corpses, crysta!
balls, and a headless man at their bar.

“The best party was our ‘Camp In’,
