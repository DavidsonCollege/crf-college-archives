The College Republicans volun-
teered for a rally attended by
President George W. Bush in Char-
lotte last Friday.

The president attended a “W
Stands For Women” rally downtown
at the Merchandise Mart, where he
spoke to a crowd of several thousand
North Carolinians.

Following the rally, President
Bush spoke at a fundraiser hosted by
prominent Democrat C. D. Spangler,
who held a dinner in the president’s
honor to help raise money for the
Republican National Committee and
Republican Congressman Richard
Burr’s senatorial campaign.

More than ten Davidson students
volunteered the morning of the rally
in various Capacities.

Endowment reaches record high

By BEN WHIGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

Davidson’s endowment grew ap-
proximately 17.36 percent over the
past fiscal year to hit a new high of
approximately $333 million.

The gains end an uncharacteristic
four-year slump during the bear
market that began in mid-2000.
Davidson’s endowment, like many
others, suffered minor losses during
the period.

Davidson’s endowment currently
provides for 21. percent of the
school’s operating budget. 10 years
ago the endowment only contributed
11 percent.

Editor-in-Chief

Last night, Dr. James Zogby, Founder and President of the Arab
American Institute and former Batten Professor at Davidson College,
gave a lecture entitled “The Mess We’re in: How America’s: Leaders

Dr. Zobgy’s lecture focused on the problems he has seen in the U.S.
policy toward the Middle East and what he thinks the best way to solve

“Our leadership has failed us,” he said. “Since Vietnam ended we have
spent more money, sent more troops and invested more political capital
in the Middle East than anywhere else in the world, yet we find ourselves

Zogby paid particular attention to how citizens in the Middle East feel
towards Americans and why they feel that way.

“[Positive] attitudes towards Americans are between three percent and
nine percent in all the Arab countries we polled,” he said.

The i increase in the endowment’s
contribution to Davidson’s operating
budget has relieved the financial
burden on students and their fami-
lies. While tuition fees amounted to
71 percent of the operating budget
10 years ago, they provide only 61
percent of the current budget.

“It’s as if every student that goes
here is getting a scholarship,” said
President Bobby Vagt.

The endowment has become an
increasingly sizeable factor in
Davidson’s budget.

“Without the endowment we’d be
much more tuition dependent,” said
Controller and Director of Business
Services Ed Kania.”““We are ina good

position compared with other schools
of our size.’

Despite the gains, Davidson’ sen-
dowmentremains smaller than many
other top colleges around the coun-
try.

“We are under capitalized com-
pared with our peers,” said President
Vagt. “While it has not been a bur-
den, we want to change that.”

President Vagt
Davidson’s endowmentas “one-half
to one-third” the size of its peers’
endowments.

“We want to grow by virtue of
contributions and by virtue of man-
agement of the endowment,” said

| ' | Homecoming scheduled

during Yom Kippur

Incident calls into question college’s
committment to various religions

By ZAcH Kazior
News Editor

Homecoming celebrations, set for
this Saturday, have been scheduled
during Yom Kippur, the holiest holi-
day of the Jewish year.

The incident has many members
of the Davidson community calling
into question the college’s commit-

Cfhent to the various religious tradi-
tions represented on campus.

“Tam both personally and institu-
tionally apologetic that this has oc-
curred. It is hardly our intention to
try to organize an event at a time
which is both inconvenient to, and

. insensitive of, the traditions of the
broad Davidson family,” said Presi-
dent Bobby Vagt, who accepted re-
sponsibility for the decision.

“The fact is that the date was set
by the Alumni Relations office and
material distributed to the entire
alumni body prior to my knowing that
ithad been scheduled to conflict with
Yom Kippur. I offer this not as an
excuse — the responsibility is mine —
but as an explanation of how it came
to pass,” Vagt said. “The scheduling
of fall events is fairly straightforward
as to the mechanics of setting the

* many special weekends, and this is

where Homecoming happened to
fall.”

Vagt said that, had he known about
the conflict, he would have made a
change.

“Tf I had known aboutit I would’ ve
changed it, and I should’ ve known
about it,” he said. “When you’re
doing something right, convenience
doesn’t matter.”

The scheduling conflict

Yom Kippur means “Day of
Atonement,” and is probably the
most important holiday in the Jew-
ish calendar.

It is a day set aside to reconcile for
the sins of the past year.

The holiday consists of a 24-hour
fast that begins before sunset on the
evening before Yom Kippur and ends
after nightfall on the day of Yom
Kippur.

All participants are to refrain from
any activity or work during the ob-
servance.

Director of Alumni Relations Matt
Merrell, after consulting with Vice
President of College Relations
Kristin Hills Bradberry, and depart-
ments such as the Admissions Office
and the College Union, ultimately
chose September 25 among others as
the date for Homecoming celebra-
tions.

“It is my principal goal to sched-
ule this event around a home foot-
ball game which becomes the unify-
ing event for the alumni over the
weekend. As well, the Homecoming
game usually becomes the best-at-
tended game of the season and is a
