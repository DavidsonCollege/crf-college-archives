Gragg Blasts Johnston’s Chapel
Talk;. Hits Christ Analogy

By GILBERT GRAGG

relics of the Lee cult!) his religious
mother, etc., which have certain-
ly been as great if not greater
than the myths of Lincoln. It
seems to me that tears instead of:
mirth would have been more in
order then, for many on the cam-
pus are members of the “Cult of
Robert E. Lee and the Con-
federacy "

In the second place the shock-
ing analogy between Christ and
Lincoln was not only out of place
but completely obliterated any
merit whatsover that the speech
might have had to our mind.
The religious cynics seemed to
get their biggest thrill out of
this, and the words “Madonna of
the Backwoods” were on almost
every other person’s lips Tuesday
afternoon. Is our generation at the
stage that it can listen to and
actually applaud and laugh at such
an analogy? One wonders just how
many persons would have ever
dreamed of making the comparison
about the births and deaths of Lin-
coln and Christ? It is beyond com-
prehension that a supposedly
Christian student body has become
so cynical that it can think a
parallel to Christ’s agonized words
from the cross: “Father forgive

curate at some points. All it can
do is to add fuel to the growing
fire of cynics whose smoke was
reaching out to try to engulf the
freshmen, it seemed Tuesday. How.
ever sincere was Dr. Johnstoa's
intention the general effect of his
speech was to produce thought-
less laughter from the students.
For example the deeply moving
spiritual poem, “When Lilacs Last
Bloom,” was the facts more min-
utely before they ascribe great-
ness to any other men—certainly
many of the listeners will never
think so much of Lincoln again
despite the efforts in the last few
minutes to retrieve his goodness
and nobility! But alas!—the fire
had gotten started and a few little
drops of water would not put it
out!

Probably seven out of ten of
the student body members have
never seen the beautiful Lincoln
Memorial, and when they do some-
day there will be no inspiration
or thrill for those who have fallen
victims to the cynicism of this
speech. Perhaps they will look
across the placid water from the
“Greek Temple” where Lincoln
proudly sits, to the Jefferson Me-
morial and Washington Monu-
ment. Then they will scoff at those

After the roars of laughter
which rocked Chambers Audi-
torium around 10:30 Tuesday
morning had finally subsided,
almost everyone agreed that it
was just about the best chapel
program of the year. For at last,
it seemed that here was the one
apswer to that strange enigma
° known as the “Davidson Chapel
Problem” which seemingly defies
solution.

Indeed the Scripture was fa-
miliar and short enough so as to
merit toleration from that seg-
ment of the student body who
cynically detest all religious ex-
ercises and rationalize themselves
into believing that the compulsory
services of this nature at David-
son are responsible for their own
anti-Christian tendencies; they
even would like to stretch our
credulity by insisting that they
were saints before coming to this
monastery, and the change has
been the fault of the college! Then,
as if this were not enough, they
did not have to listen to a prayer,
but repeat half-sleepily the
Lord’s Prayer (unbelieveably in-
appropriate for a chapel service
since both have become just rou-
tine). On top of this they didn’t

Don’t Play Fast and Loose
With Lady Luck

The fact that no students of this college have been killed
in an automobile accident in the last four years is indeed a
remarkable record considering the number of traffic accidents
in which they have been involved.

Naturally, it is everyone’s hope that this campus will not
be marred by a traffic fatality for an indefinite period. It
seems, though, that luck has been pretty much on our side
for these four years, and it is questionable how much longer
the good lady will play along with us.

In this period we have had at least one case of critical

injury, several lesser ones, and quite a few wrecks in which
the Grim Reaper missed fine opportunities to take its toll.

Though not a hell driver the average Davidson student
behind the wheel does not reflect the staid, Presbyterian,
conservatism, for which his detractors criticize him in other
fields. In short, he, like many another college student, af-
fords an example of why auto insurance rates are higher for
the 19-25 age group than for any other. This is not true of
every one, but for a sufficient number to cause alarm.

We do not mean to be unnecessarily critical, for which
ot us has never taken a few chances himself, but to put it

We hereby renounce all claim to the title of “prophet
of doom” we hesitatingly assumed in last week’s editorial.

Last Tuesday night’s victory over South Carolina was
certainly the best thing that could have happened to the
whole college. Congratulations are in order for the basket-
ball team that certainly played an inspired game and Coach
Danny Miller. This was one instance when the “venerable”
Davidson spirit came through in the best of fashion.

We would like to observe, however, that, our situation
in regard to athletic policy still has not changed materially.
We wish all the luck in the world to the basketball team, and
feel considerably better about their chances, but Davidson
is still in the middle of the road and we are dubious about
our chances of winning more than a very few contests in
the long run under present conditions.

But for the time being we can enjoy a long delayed exul-

was temporarily silenced the con-
templation of our most current
problem—the athletic situation—
has continued.

In my last column there was
an approach to the athletic prob-
lem that had not been attempted
before. Using some of the devices
of the case method now employed
in many of our business courses,
the financial and fiscal facts were
presented. This method employs
full analysis in the light of the
actual situation and not the vague
generalities and removal from the
facts that the undergraduate mind
often uses.

That method is not an entirely
valid one until the logical con-
clusions that may be taken from
the facts are elicited. Now let us
see what we face.

Conclusions among others thus
far have ranged widely. One is,
“The ‘worm’ is turning and our
athletic fortunes are improving.
Just wait and let time change for
the better what it inevitably must.”
Yet another runs, “Davidson is so
attuned psychologically and emo-
tionally to failing in sports that it
actually forms a great necessity
for the present adjustment of the
students and the college as a
whole.”

Opinions vary on sports as they
do on any other subject, and, as
Professor Griffin is often wont to
point out, alternatives are the
surest points of conclusions in any
analysis.

In understanding the solution
which I will here give, it would
be well for the reader to disasso-
ciate the situation from his own
prejudices as much as the writer
has tried to do with himself and
the subject.

Moody Smith calls our present
policy “hopeless,” and so it is
when we turn over in our minds
the hopes of our athletic endeavors
and the returns superficially we
seem to be gaining from the ef-

a | fort expended. Obviously, we are

not winning games in football nor
in the other major sports, and the
prospects of our breaking even in
the future are not so changed by
a single basketball victory.

The reaction to that win of Tues.
day night illustrates how win-
starved we are. The childish way
in which some students expressed
their pent up feelings—in the
riot—didn’t stem alone from the
defeat of South Carolina but came
as well from, frustrations reached
in the classroom and elsewhere.

One win—or even winning sev-
eral games—does not alter basical-
ly the problem, for though this
may assuage temporarily our ap-
petite for prestige and athletic
respectability, it does not alter
fundamentally the questions
raised by our present policy.

The true purpose of the athletic
program, which is the building of
the body so that the mind may
best be used, is not being realized

Bigmte FS | today, nor is it the guiding prin-

ciple on which our entire program
is laid. Players, already injured,
are sent into games and they are
frequently so out-manned to such
an extent that further injury and
defeat are inevitable.

Many of these comments have
been made before and now the
question is, “What can we do to-
day to improve our situation?”

Last week the editor-in-chief
suggested three alternatives that
are in themselves not entirely sat-
isfactory. Full subsidization not
only violates many of our moral
ideals but also is impossible be-
cause the money cannot be raised.

Dropping football would remove
the school from its greatest single
contact with the alumni, and this
would hurt us tremendously as
the very existence of the school
depends on financial support by
the alumni. Also there is the loss
of contact with prospective stu-
dents through the lessened pub-
licity potential and the frequent
lack -of understanding on the part
of high school and prep school
students that intercollegiate ath-
letics play in the make-up of a
school.

If we decide to reduce our
present athletic budget and-drop
into a league where we might
have better chances of winning,
one might ask what league this
would be. Even the North State
League, often mentioned in this
connection, does more for its teams
in a financial way than we now
do. The Sewanee, John Hopkins,
Centre system of an unsubsidized
program presents us with the prob-
lem of how to pay for equipment,
coaches, upkeep of fields, and
costs of trips, for in that system
there are no gate receipts.

—_—-

Thus we see that there is no
“easy” way out of our dilemina,
nor should we try to substitute an
over-simplified way for what must
represent a system based on hope
rather than our present defeatism;
one of an honest expression of
our ideals rather than a com-
promise situation that attempts to
satisfy both the superficial wants
of a winning team and the desire
for amateur athletics; and finally
one that will be long-lasting and
subject only to the necessary
changes of the time rather than
one that is dependent on winning
seasons for its existence.

Therefore I offer the following
plan of action that is based on
both the existing circumstances
and my own opinion grounded on
four years of observation and per-
sonal belief.

(1) Drop football as an_ inter-
collegiate sport. (2) install class or
fraternity ° football competition
similar to that found at Emory
University. (3) Place further em-
phasis on the other intramural
sports; and, (4) allow the sports to
dominate that place less emphasis
on the spectators and more on the
development of the individual par-
ticipants.

The Wildcat Club should chan-
nel its energies and funds in a
direction which will be helpful to
the entire college, as the Living
Endowment.

even have to be pained with the
singing of a hymn, although one
might have suspected the service
would have concluded’ with
“Dixie” and Confederate flag-wav-
ing! So there was an omen from
the beginning that the cynics and
anti-religious boys were going to
have a field day, and indeed they
did!

Dr. Johnston prefaced his re-
marks on “The Lincoln Myth” by
saying that it had been misunder-
stood in the past, but then he pro-
ceeded to go on into his speech
and missed a perfect opening to
give a much needed clarification
of his real purpose or the way in
which he meant it not to be mis-
understood. With this golden op-
portunity gone he proceeded mer-
rily, if not unknowingly, on his
way leading his cynical listeners
in a delightful exercise of their
favorite pursuit—-satirical proju-
diced criticism of Christian noble-
ness!

Such words need fuller explana-
tion, and this will be the purpose
of this article. In the first place
we wonder why this particular
subject was chosen? Was it be-
cause most of the students are
Southerners and therefore nat-
urally gleeful in hearing anything
disparaging about a Yankee—par-
ticularly their renowned leader?
Was it chosen in order to give the
students an enlarged appreciation
for one of the few really great
men our country has produced?
Or was it chosen to exploit the
legends and myths that have
grown up around Lincoln?

If the latter were the purpose,
then it seems reasonable to sug-
gest that if “legends and myths”
had to be the subject, then why
did not the speaker choose the
much more appropriate figure of
Robert BE. Lee? Surely there were
not many, if any, member of the
“Lincoln Cult” in the audience and
many probably viewed him with
violent distaste anyway because of
the label “Yankee” attached to
him. One wonders if the laughter
would have been quite so strong
if Dr. Johnston had spoken of
“Lee’s Farewell to his Men" and
the veneration given to his horse,
(whose bones at Washington and
Lee are among the most sacred

them for they know not what they
do” could be an_ occasion for
laughter no matter in what con-
text they were used; these words
seemed particularly appropriate in
another sense on Tuesday. Even
such great cynical writers as G. B.
Shaw may refer to saints and the
like, but with all their cynicism
they have the good taste to stop
and never to transport the sublime
character of Christ, even by ana
character of Chirst, even by
analogy, to the pages of their
novels or plays. There is certainly
a limit as to how far analogies can
go, and a thing of such eternal
significance for each of us as the
Crucifixion of our Lord should be
spoken of with greatest reverence
and realization of its meaning and
not be glibly compared with the
death of a man, who did not make
his supposed “With malice toward
none . . .” speech on his death-
bed, which was the implication of
Dr. Johnston's speech and which
would have to be so to make the
analogy true.

Indeed, Dr. Johnston, who cer-
tainly knows the basic facts of
history seems intentionally to have
violated at least one of these facts
in order to form an inappropriate
and rankly offensive analogy. If
we are not mistaken, Dr. Johnston
said Lincoln was shot on Good
Friday and died on Easter Sunday,
thereby making complete his ill-
chosen and of itself illogical
analogy to Christ’s death and
Resurrection. To quote Carl Sand-
burg who, although a fine poet—
and this seems lately to be a
questionable virtue to the minds
of some—is nevertheless recog-
nized by many as the world’s fore-
most authority on the known facts
of Lincoln's life:

“The last breath was drawn at
21 minutes and 55 seconds past
7 +A.M. and the last heartbeat
flickered at 22 minutes and ten
seconds past the hour on Saturday,
April 15, 1865.” This may be found
in the chapter entitled “Blood on
the Moon” from Volume IV of
Abraham Lincoin, the War Years
by Mr. Sandburg.

Obviously then not much good
can come out of such a speech
which besides some lapses from
good taste was historically inac-

Best way to make Dad forget those letters you
didn’t write is to get him some fine Manhaltan
menswear. (And Manhatian makes mighty nice

Why not stop in today—and see for yourself,

poor misguided souls who actually
believe that these were great
leaders of our country and who
give them the veneration due
them!

After all, is it wrong to be
proud of our great forefathers?
We are fully aware that they are
simply human beings like our-
selves and therefore do not expect
them to be divine in actions. It
