Sports Round Up

Scrimmages Feature

Early Football Drills

The question of whether our Wildcat cagemen will qualify
for this year’s Southern Conference tournament will probably
be settled this week when they take on North Carolina State,
Wake Forest, and The Citadel. Winner of only three out of
ten Conference engagements, the Wildcats must win all but
one of their six remaining loop games to attain the .500 or
better average usually necessary to get. in the tournament.
The outlook is not as black as it seems, for if the ’Cats can
get by the Demon Deacons, they face second division teams
through the rest of the schedule. Furman, South Carolina,
and State are all near the bottom of the loop and the Wild-
cats stand an excellent chance of beating them. So don't give
up, we may make it to Raleigh yet.

As for the rest of the Conference, it looks now as if
° Duke’s “Little Blues” will lead the pack home. The Blue
Devils face their severest test this week, playing Clemson’s
defending champs, Wake Forest, and Washington and Lee.
The Dukes will prove that they really belong at the top
of the heap if they vanquish these three potent fives.

Diamond Outlook

Although we may be rushing the season a bit, the balmy
weather turns a young man’s fancy to thoughts of the dia-
mond,._Considering the local prospects for the coming season,
it looks to this corner as though Coach Norman Shepard will
have a wealth of material, with no outstanding candidates.
The main problems at present seem te-be-to—find—a-capable
catcher. -Dan Cagle, “Rusty” Edmondson, and Walter Fitz-
gerald, all veteran infielders, have reported for early mitt
work-outs and the opening game will probably find one of
them behind the plate. Bob McLeod, a soph, is another. candi
date. At first base, we find Frank Niven bagk for another
year of duty. At second, “Black Dog” Hunter will face strong
competitien from Tommy Yarborough, leading hitter of last
year’s frosh team. [Either Hunter or Yarborough may be shift-
ed to third base to get more hitting strength in the line-up.
Short-stop, in the event that Edmondson catches, will proba-
bly be held down by Jim Owens, another sophomore. Owens
hit-well over..300_last year and_is_anexcellent fielder. The loss
of Sam Hemphill leaves the third base position vacant with
no one to step into that breach. Loss of Hicks, Steere, and
Hand leaves the Wildcats without a veteran outfielder. Coach
Shepard has plenty of good fielders on hand, but the problem
is to find powerful hitters to patrol the outer garden. Verner,
Morris, Daffin, Hogg, and Smith are possible outer gardeners.

The pitching staff will apparently be the strongest part
of the team. Despite the fact that Hicks’ departure will
be keenly felt, veterans Dave McLean and “Hayseed”

Thomas should form the nucleus of a good staff. Ed Lucas,

Bob Reinhardt, and George Ficklen will undoubtedly see

muth service.

Things we've often wondered about—How George Gla-
mack can ring ’em up when he can scarcely see the basket
from the foul line... Who's going to stop the Duke’s cagers
in 1941 when Mock, Allen, and Spuhler are Seniors . .. Why
so many Pennsylvania boys come all the way down to Duke
when there are many good schools up there Why «the
University of Virginia had to drop out of the Southern Con-
ference to subsidize athletes ... Whether Banks McFadden
is as good as he’s cracked up to be... Why we can’t have a
new gym... Why the same students who are always com-
plaining about the football team haven't turn in any prospects
to Coach McEver ... Who will be All-Southern Conference
center this year, Footsie, George, or Banks... Why Carolina
doesn’t use a two man team, Glamack to shoot and Jimmy
Howard to feed him the ball... What happened to last year’s
starting Wildkitten quintet ... How Tennessee has the nerve
to make its schedule public... What happened to “Whizzer”
White... Why “Dizzy” Dean doesn't realize he’s washed up.
... Who'll stop the Yanks .. . Whether we'll ever beat “Dook”
on the gridiron again...

and Wednesday to the tune of
47-30 and 44-31 respectively,
giving the ’Cats a record of
three wins and seven losses in
the conference.

Playing listless ball the ‘Cats

at the end of the first five minutes.

Cowan Leads Scorers

Captain “Footsie” Cowan had 13
points and. Jimmy Hogg had 8 for
Davidson. Sophomores Bill Mock
and Clyde Allen led the “Little
Blues” with 12 and 8 respectively.
Carolina’s White Phantoms jump-
ed off to an early lead which they
maintained throughout the game. A
specially constructed defense held

the Phant’s high-scoring center
George Glamack to seven points,
but the ‘Cat's inability to hit the

bucket proved their downfall. Jim-
my Hogg was high-scorer for the
Wildcats with 11 points, while
“Foots” followed with 9. Jackie
Simonds and Benny Harrison play-
ed nice floor games. The Carolina
scoring was spread evenly with
Chuck Pessar getting 8 for top posi-
tion.

Yesterday and the day before the
‘Cats took. on State and Wake
Forest respectively. Saturday they
journey to Charleston to engage the
Citadel. They continue to Colum-
bia to take on South Carolina Mon-
day. Then Coach Shepard’s boys
return home to play host to the
Gamecocks in a return game Wed-

petition the Wildcat quintet has
won three and dropped seyen and
will have to play brilliantly to quali-
