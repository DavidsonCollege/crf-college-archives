GEORGE RAMSEY

“I’m mighty happy to see the boys doing so well.”

For a Davidson coach who is in the throes of pro-
ducing an undefeated athletic team, these may seem
like calm words. But as Heath Whittle speaks, you
can feel the excitement in his voice.

Whittle’s track team needs but to sweep their
three-way meet with N. C. State and Wake Forest
next Saturday to compile a perfect 9-0 slate for the
1957 season. If he does it, it will mark the third
undefeated season for the “Cinder Master’ while
at Davidson.

Early in the year he figured on a strong outfit,

ARMSTRONG

WHITTLE

but several performers have come on strong to sur-
prise even Whittle.

BIGGEST SURPRISE

The biggest surprise, he says, is the arrival of
sophomore Mel Armstrong as a top sprinter. Following
the departure of conference champion Phil Koonce last
year, Whittle wondered what in the world he was
going to do.

Armstrong, however, stepped right into Koonce’s
shoes and, participating in the 100- and 200-yard dashes
as well as the broad jump, is at present the leading
individual scorer.

Whittle rates the strength in the javelin throw
as another surprise on this year’s outfit. Angus
McBryde, versatile distance runner, has moved into
this event, and along with Stuart Nickles and Walter
Edwards, comprises a strong threesome in this de-
partment. .

McBryde also rates an excellent chance of breaking
the school record in the two-mile run, according to
Whittle, who added that the rangy soph may run the
mile next year following the departure of ace Pete
Ashcraft, Wildeat record-holder in the distances.

TOUGHEST FOES

Looking back over the '57 campaign, Whittle ranks
the Clemson and Richmond meets as his toughest. For
the eighth consecutive year, the Davidson-Clemson
tangle was settled in the mile relay. The victory over

C,.

x o

Richmond avenged a defeat which the Spiders hung on
the locals in 1956.

As for the prospects for the coming conference
meet, he looks for William and Mary to be very
strong, closely followed by V.M.I. and V.P.I. Hesi-.
tant about a specific prediction, Whittle added that
“My boys have always seemed to do their best in
the conference meet.”

Because not a great number of points is necessary
to win the meet, and because he has several individuals
who should cop top honors, Whittle is obviously very
optimistic concerning the meet.

Linksmen Cop Win
Over West Virginia

Davidson’s golf team nabbed
a 16%-10% victory from West
Virginia on Monday afternoon
for their third conference vic-
tory. The win brought the
‘Cats’ record to 5-6.

Sam Sloan and Ned Payne
copped 3-0 victories over the
Mountaineers’ Lane and Rit-
kervich, respectively, and
Bucky Dennis end Stuart
Vaughan added 2-1 victories
for the majority of the locals’
points, ,
Coach Tom Scott, comment-
ing on the match, said, “We
were happy to make a clean
sweep with the West Virginia
team.”

With hopes of evening the
season’s record at 6-all, the
linksmen will take on the
Furman squad on May 2 at
Danville, Virginia, in a warm-
up for the Southern Confer-
ence tournament which is set
for Danville on May 3.

JAYVEE ACTIVITY

The junior varsity was not
so fortunate in their Tues-
day match with Myers Park
High School of Charlotte.
The Mustangs sparked by
Verner Stenley, who fired a
two-under-par 70, dropped
‘the Davidson JVs, 18-9.

Sut Alexander and Ed Bell
took the only Wildkitten wins
in the Myers Park meeting.
The loss marked a split in
the season's matches for the
JVs, both of their matches
having been with the Charlotte
team.

SWINGS
VIRGINIA

BY JIM HAMILTON

The Davidson baseball squad
pulled out of the Holy City
Tuesday afternoon and headed
north for a four-day sojourn
in Virginia. They will return
tomorrow night.

William and Mary played
host to the Cats in a double
header Wednesday afternoon at
Williamsburg. Coach Stevens
and squad then moved to Lex-
ington for games with W. & L.
this afternoon and one Satur-
day.

TENTH DEFEAT

Last Friday the Cats suffer-
ed weir tenth defeat of the
season at the hands of the
strong McCrary ‘ Eagles. The
Eagles slammed three David-
son pitchers all over the field
to gain an 8-1 win. Jim West's
home run accounted for the
only Davidson tally.

The following aiternoon Mer-
cer edged the ‘Cats in ten inn-
ings, 5-4, despite a fine per-
formance by Davidson hurlers,
Page and Green. Donny McRee
had two for three and West

two for four to lead the locals.

WEST VIRGINIA FALLS

Monday afternoon the flow

of fortune changed and the
‘Cats got all the breaks to
swamp West Virginia, 15-4.
Allen Moore allowed the visi-
tors only six scratch hits.
Comer, West, and McRee were
the big guns at the plate for
Davidson.

Due to powerful hitting in
the last three games West held
on to’ the batting average lead,
with a 437 mark after sixteen
games,

Both Coach Stevens and hia
players were optimistic about
the trip. Stevens believes the
time has come for the Cats
to start winning if, as he puts
it, “they get the breaks they've
been deserving all year.”

PLAYERS COMMENT
The players too are: in high

spirits. Freshman _ slugger
George Hart feels that “We've
finally stepped out of. our
slump."

Moore added in an authori-
tative voice, “We'll make a
clean sweep this week.”

Manager Dave _ Beckham
agrees, for, as he said, “What
“Bam Bam" says around here
is the law.”
