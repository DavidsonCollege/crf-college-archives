Mr. David Ovens
Makes Gift Of
$100,000 To D.C.

A $100,000 gift to Davidson Col-
lege by Mr. David Ovens of Char-
lotte was announced early this week
by Dr. Cunningham. Dr. Cunning-
ham in expressing his gratitude on
behalf of the college commended
Mr. Ovens on his wisdom in donat-
ing the money while he can sce
the results of his gift.

The money will be applied to-
ward construction of the new $220.-
000 Student Union Building which
will bear the name of Mr. Ovens.

Mr. Ovens’ gitt is his second
major contribution to Christian
education in less than a
In December he gave $250,000 to
Queens College in Charlotte.

His gift is the largest amount
given to Davidson since the $2,-
500,000 Development Program
which was concluded last June.

The Ovens Student Union will
include office space for the David-
sonian, Scripts ’n Pranks, Quips and
Cranks, student government, a
enack bar, banquet hall and several
private dining rooms, game rooms
and music listening rooms.

Construction on the building will
begin in the near future and will
be completed before the 1951-52
term opens in September. Located
directly behind Chambers Build-
ing, the Ovens Union will be rcadi-
ly accessible from dormitories,
class rooms and fraternity houses.

For a number of years, Mr.
Ovens, Vice-president of J. B. Ivey
and Co., has been prominently con-
nected with church and civic affairs.
Last year, he was named the Char-
lotte News’ “Man of the Year” in
Charlotte.

DUKE SETS UP
$-YEAR PLAN
FOR FRESHMEN

Duke University President Hol-
lis Edens announced this week that
the institution will accept freshman
students in June to begin a “na.
tional emergency” college program
that will permit them to graduate
in three years.

Under the accelerated war pro-
gram, a high school graduate en-
tering Duke in June, 1951, can
graduate in June, 1954.

“While the details of such a pro-
gram will have to‘await action from
Washington,” Edens said, “the
University deems it essential to pro-
vide opportunity for high school
graduates to begin their college
training at the earliest possible
date.”

The Duke president continued,
“This program is in line with the
advice of national leaders and high
school counselors who are urging
young people to begin their college
work ae soon as possible, because
of the imminence of military ser-
vice.”

Moreover, Edens pointed out,
students Row in college are being
urged to complete their work as
quickly as they can.

“The University is thus making
provision,” he said, “for accommo-
dating as many students as wish to
accelerate their college career.”

Duke officials said recent de-
velopments in Korea have had little
effect thus far on enrollment, but
a number of students are expected
to leave for the armed forces at
the end of the first semester which
comes soon.

Some 37 students out of an en-
rollment of 5,000 have entered the
service since September.

Dr. Eberhardt said that the mem-
bers of the expedition do not ex.
pect to make any startling discover-
ies. They will carry on routine in-
vestigation and examination of the
life and times of people living in
Biblical days. From February 1
until about April 15 their work will
center around the ruins of a palace
built by the son of Herod the Great.
Dr. Eberhardt will work with ten
or fifteen other Bible scholars in
classifying, recording, and inter-
preting the results of the excaya-

SHAW, CHORAL CONDUCTOR,
GIVES SIDELIGHTS ON WORK

By SHELLY BEARD

T talked to a man Wednesday] and the Pittsburgh Symphony.

night for about ten minutes. He
is a famous man in a way. He is
conductor of the best choral group
in America today. Robert Shaw
probably would shy away from
such a positive statement, but this
is not the first time it’s been made.
I'm sure Mr. Fred Waring would
agree and perhaps Mr. Toscanini,
would too. As for the audi¢nce that
heard the concert there is no doubt.
From the stage Mr. Shaw looks
and acts like a well fed junior exe-
cutive. But, from across a table the
character of the man can best be
seen in the deeply cut lines of his
face, the blood-shot eyes, and the
mobile mouth. It is easy to see that
here is a man who has not had
nough sleen or relaxation for a
long time. His hands and eyes are
ver still betraying a sort of coiled
mpatience.
This impatience seems to stem
‘om an awareness of the shortness
( life. For this reason Shaw feels
vat he is wasting his time when
e is working on anything but ser-
ws music such as the “Requiem
fass’ that his group performed
ist night. His greatest rewards
come from completing a perfor-
mance of great music. Because of
this deep desire for the best in
music he quit show business, where
he got his start, and organized his
choral group.
Robert Shaw didn't start out to
be a musician and had no college
preparation in music. He began,
however, in his first year after grad.
uation to build Fred Waring’s Glee
Club and remained to help arrange
and rehearse programs. Real no-
tice did not. come until he organ-
ized and conducted a choral group
of one hundred and thirty voices.
From this beginning he has risen
to national importance in his field
working with some of the top musi-
cal figures and ensembles in the
world including Arturo Toscanini

Shippey Blasts
Psycho Jargon

The Beta Theta Pi house was the
meeting place for Sigma Upsilon on
January 4, Irving Stubbs called
the meeting to. order. Following
the usual business, Dr. Johnston
presented an article entitled “Edu-
cation in Ante Bellum South.” Pro-
fessor Johnston brought out the
fact that education at that time
was for the leaders or Aristocracy
rather than for commoners. He
also stressed the fact that religion
was the best ally of education at
that time.

After Dr. Johnston's story Irving
Stubbs read “O Davidson” written
in Milton’s style of writing. Next
S. H. Shippey presented an article
entitled “Psychological Jargon.”
This essay on the language used
by psychologists brought out the
fact that the average person cannot
understand many words used in
psychology. The last article of the
meeting was a poem written by
Hartley Hall. It was a self-portrait
of a man presented in verse. Fol-
lowing this poem the meeting ad-
journed,

Mr. Shaw does no composing of
his own, he said that he wished
that he could. He does most of his
own arranging for recordings and
broadcasts. The actual details of
his work take most of his time.
On tour it usually takes 16 hours
a day of continuous work to keep
the Choral going and at it’s peak.

Mr. Shaw said that he enjoyed
performing before a college audi-

ence more than any other kind. He
said you could do the serous stuff
and get response and then do the
light stuff and still be appreciated.

Temperament doesn’t seem to
bother the choral although it is
composed of fifty musicians sup.
posedly the most unpredictable peo-
ple in the world. Of course in it’s
trips over the nation the usual mis.
haps occur, Once the podium split
in the middle of a high note and
Shaw disappeared from sight for
a short. while, but returned in time
for seven encores. Another time
the soloist got laryngitis and had
to eat vaseline before her voice re-
turned.

The man with the long hair will
probably be enjoyed by audiences
such as ours for years to come. He
has the personality, the talent and
the determination to reproduce
good music that is loved by every.
one.

Chapel Schedule

Because the week of January 15-
19 is during the semester examina-
tion period, the regular chapel per-
iod for that time has been shortened
to fifteen minute periods each day
and will be at 12:00. On Monday,
January fifteenth, Dr. McGeachy
will be in charge, and on Tuesday
the devotional will be under the
direction of Professor Roberts. Mr.
Paul Scott will lead Wednesday’s
Chapel. Thursday is Y.M.C.A. Day
and on Friday, January ninetcenth,
Professor Erwin will lead the pro-
gram. Seniors will not be required
to attend chapel during the examin.
ation period.

World Public Opinions Vigorously Expressed

One of the most interesting and
enlightening -events of the school
year came to the campus last week-
end (Jan. 6-8) in the form of the
Y.M.C.A. forum on contemporary
world attitudes. It is the purpose
of this article to acquaint the read.
er with some of the highlights of
the forum and the issues which
were brought to light during this
extensive survey of our world in
the opening weeks of 1951.

The forum had its initial meeting,
on Saturday afternoon in the form
of a March of Time movie on
“Sweden.” Following this came
similar films on China, Italy, and
India in that order. That night at
7:30 p. m., the first actual discus-
sion group centered their thoughts
on the subject “Political Attitudes,”
led by Pete Kalogridis, with the
forum composed of Tomihiko Kam-
bara, a Buddhist from Tokyo, Ja-

Delegates to the mecting ex-
pressed deep concern over the ef.

Snavely said the meeting would
work toward a united front for pre-

were a number of opinions among
educators on what students should
be deferred and on the methods of
determining studeyts for deferment.

A number of educators expressed
the opinion small colleges
would be hurt so much by the draft
they would be forced to close down.

The concensus of opinion among
most Davidson men of eligible draft
age seems at present to be that if
they want a choice of services, their
best bet is to enlist before being
drafted. A few feel that their aca-
demic grades do not warrant a
deferment and are afraid of being
taken from school anyway.

Just how many men will join
the ranks at the end of the semes-
ter is anybody's guess, but a large
number of students have expressed
their intention to enlist. However,
the recent strict quotas set up by
the Air Force, which most of the
men seem to favor, will doubtless
have an effect on some enlistments.

Fratersity boarding houses, par-
ticularly in the smaller fraternities,
have already felt the effect caused
by a reduced number of paying
members, and further loss of men
may pose a serious problem to them.

Davis, in an exclusive in-
terview with the David-
sonian said, ‘‘The fact that
no freshmen have been re-
ported since Christmas
holidays seems to indicate
that upperclassmen are
about ready to accept the

the foreign students with Dieter

area of discussion concerned re.

and failing to do in Europe. At the

complete unity in the world.

Schedule Announced
By Flick Society

With ‘its fall schedule drawing to
a close tonight with. a triple-header

shorts, the United Literary Film
Society this week' announced its
spring semester scries of films.

The six-picture program promises
to be even better than the fine
schedule offered this semester, En-
couraged by the great enthusiasm
shown by students and faculty tow-
ards the efforts of the Socicty, the
steering committee has already
planned the following program:

requested award-winner that played
for months in New York. Four of
Somerset Maugham's short stories.

March 16: “Jane Eyre.” Orson

forgettable novel of 19th century
England.

April 6:  Double-feature, “The
Mad Queen” presented in conjunc-
tion with the Spanish department.

April 13: “The Stone Flower.”
A breathtakingly beautiful Russian

legend. Awarded First Prize for

tional Festival.

April 20: “Crime and Punish-
ment.” Again a much requested pic-
ture. The great psychological novel
by Dostoevski. Produced in France.

This is not a tentative: schedule.
Because of the dhcertainty of the
response to their program, the so-
ciety Jast semester necessarily was
unable to contract for the Intended
pictures early and consequently was
able to get only one of the an-
nounced films. The above schedule,
with the exception of. “The Mad
Queen,” has been confirmed and
