Put The"Greek” Back In"Hell Week"

An alumnus, returning to the
campus last Wednesday for a brief
stay commented, “Well, looks like
‘Hell Week’ is in full progress.”

“No,” we explained, “It’s ‘Greek
Week,’ not ‘Hell Week.” He said he
didn’t see much difference. We didn’t
either when we thought about it.

The brick sacks, calisthenics, egg
throwing, and general pledge har-
rassment are as much with us this
year as last, except the time regula-
tions forced several fraternities to
Start earlier and work harder at show-
ing pledges just what miserable crea-.

tures they were supposed to be.
Despite the IFC pronouncement

that there would be no physical exert-
ion, a significant stream of freshmen
has showed up at the infirmary for
treatment of injuries received in the
line of’ duty. A check Wednesday
night revealed that a partial account-
ing up to that time included two
sprained ankles (one a case for
crutches), a seriously injured toe,
initially considered to be broken, and
a badly bruised back with possible
injury to a kidney...We suspect that
by’ the time this paper reaches the
dorms .the list will be considerably
longer.

Without sounding coy we must sug-

gest that these injuries, and the mul-
titude of sore muscles plaguing the
freshmen have come from something
more strenuous than helping Barium
Springs orphans paint playground
equipment.

The sum of the matter is that
most of the letter of the law con-
cerning “Greek Week" activities is
being observed, but the idea has been
lost. The IFC, by adopting a ridicul-
ously loose interpretation of the
rules, has made little contribution to
preserving their spirit.

We fail to see the logic of the ac-
tivities of the recent “Greek Week,”
but more important, we feel that the
IFC and its member fraternities have
failed to work for the original stated
objective of ending the outdated ac-
tivities of traditional “Hell Weeks.”

Nothing can be done about the
week just past, but the DAVIDSON-
IAN suggests that the IFC act imme-
diately to outlaw drilling, calisthenics,
mud baths, and the other impedi-
menta which turned this past week
into a ‘Hell Week.”

If the IFC does not act, the facul-
ty may. We think it is better to keep
the problem under student control,
if student leadership demonstrates
the maturity to handle it.

College Bowl: Success or Failure?

By the grace of CBS, Davidson
will soon have a chance to grab the
brass ring on the TV College Bowl.
This program is essentially the same
in purpose and method as the more
renowned quiz shows (Twenty-One,
$64,000 Question, etc.), with the add-
ed interest of intercollegiate com-
petition.

We should have the proper feel-
ings of gratitude, of course, to the
network, the producers, and General
Electric, which sponsors the show, for
Davidson is certainly not an obvious
choice to compete in the same league
as schools like Notre Dame and
Princeton.

We had better realize that when it
is announced that the challenger on
April 19’s program will be Davidson
College, several million Americans
will ask ‘Where's, that?”

It is quite possible that Davidson’s
“team” will do well on the program.
It is just as possible that they will

fail miserably.

With either outcome, however, we
are in danger of: reacting the wrong
way. If we should succéed, there will
be a widespread feeling that our suc-
cess is indicative of a general level
of education equivalent to or better
than that of the school we beat. If
we lose, some short-sighted people
will declare that this implies general
inferiority in education and culture
among the students, and that steps
should be taken to pump the student
body full of facts similar to those re-
quired for success on the College
Bowl.

Either reaction, as serious re-
flection will show, would be irration-
al. The College Bowl is an interesting
exercise in memory and reaction time
for certain individuals, but from per-
formance on it no conclusions can be
drawn one way another concerning
the success of a college’s educational
program, or the worth of its goals.

Spring Brings Cultural Opportunity |

Dr. Davidson’s chapel presenta-
tion last week was a most refreshing
change from the dull and haranguing
diatribes we are accustomed to listen-
ing to between the hours of 10:20
and 11:00 three times a week. The
hilarious, musically annotated ex-
travaganza was most appropriate.

Too many times we have heard
chapel. orators attack the values of
the present Davidson generation and
warn us that we are nothing but a
group of conformists. For several
years student writers and caffeine
philosophers have placed the David-
son student into the conformity-or-
ganization-security mold with com-
parative ease. It hds almost become a
tradition to criticize the college.

Good constructive criticism is
necessary for growth and perhaps the
critics are partly right in that we
need more originality and idealism
on the Davidson scene. But for the
most part all that we have heard and
read about the Davidson student be-
ing “homogenized” and “moulded” is
itself, in effect, leading this school to-
ward stagnation in a pot filled with
cynicism and pessimism.

There is much to be said, how-
ever, for Davidson College as a liv-
ing ideal. The college prides herself
on the well-rounded program she of-

fers, both in the curricular and ex-
tracurricular activities. Perhaps
would be a good idea to hear more
often from the musical talents of the
student body, for example, preferably
in the morning Chapel service. That
is, provided the sophisticates of
WIST’s “Fabulous Forty” could spare
the courtesy to appreciate this type
of program.

The anti-conformists are right in
one respect at least. A basic defect
of Davidson students has long been
an unconcern for national and inter-
national affairs in several areas:
science, politics, economics, religion,
honest intellectualism. Last fall, the
Great Issues Program almost kindled
a creative interest in the current
events which give meaning to our ab-
Stract curricular material, but the
spark was soon to be snuffed out by
intellectual indifference.

This spring there will be many
cultural opportunities such as the
Fine Arts Festival and the ever-pres-
ent Artist Series. If Davidson is ever
to achieve the alleged broadening ef-
fect of a liberal arts education, it
would seem that occasionally the
Mooresville flick should yield to a
personage like Clement Attlee.

Are we getting a liberal education
of the arts or an arty view of the
liberals? —S.R.L.

CLASS OF ‘62

Freshmen Top Survey Of College Board Averages In South

By ED ARMFIELD
Davidsonian Managing Editor

Some weeks ago Assistant
Dean of Students H. Edmunds
White sent o request to lead-
ing colleges and universities in
the South and throughout the
nation asking them to supply
Davidson with information re-
garding College Board results
both for comparison and for
admissions study.

DAVIDSON TOPS

An analysis of the informa-
tion returned to Mr. White
shows that Davidson (the Class
of '62, at least) ranks at the
top in Southern schools and de-
serves high ranking nationally.

Centre, Sewanee, Southwest-
ern and Stetson were the South-
ern schools which sent replies
containing the necessary infor-
mation to make an objective
comparison of schools.

MATH

In the math score, Davidsqn
was high with an average of
§70 followed closely by
Sewanee with a class average

of 553, In verbal average the
lead positions were reversed
with Sewanee holding an edge
of six points.

In both math and verbal the
other schools .followed in the
order of Southwestern, Centre
and Stetson, all Southern
schools with which Davidson is
often compared.

Emory, Vanderbilt and Wash-
ington and Lee were all con-
tacted but either neglected to
answer or chose not to publish
their scores. Duke University
sent material which would be
difficult to analyze in this bricf
study.

ENTIRE NATION

A quick glance at the com-
parative scores of the corre-
sponding schools of all other
sections of the country — East,
Wooster; Mid-West, Chicago:
Far West, Pomona — would
give the impression that the
calibre of student entering
these schools is much higher
than the average Davidson
freshman. -

“No Hazing Allowed” - IFC .

LETTER TO EDITOR

However, one should remem-
ber that in other sections of
the country students are bet-
ter acquainted with standard-
ized tests and in many in-
stances study for just that type
of test, whereas many students
in the South are completely
unfamiliar with this type of
testing. This can account for
much of the gap between South-
ern schools and schools from
other parts of the country.

Nonetheless, Davidson's
score is much above average
for the entire nation. The
schools listed below represent
the very best of American ed-
ucational institutions.

62 EXTRA CURRICULAR

At the same time the College
Board averages were released
Dean White also gave to the
DAVIDSONIAN a summary of
some of the many high-school
activities of the Class of ‘60.

These are figures which Pres-
ident Martin recently reported
to the Board of Trustees during
their winter meeting to iNus-
trate the well rounded qualities
and diversified interests which
accompanied such commend:
able scholastic achievement.

ATHLETICS

In athletics 55% of the
Freshmen won monograms and
many others participated but
not to a sufficient extent to
earn a letter. Those who won
varsity letters averaged four
letters per student, which in-
dicates year-round athletic par-
ticipation.

About one-third of the class
were either president or vice-
president of their high school
student body or of their class
in high school. Of this number
twenty freshmen were presi-
dent of their student body. In
addition to the 33% cited

above an additional 42% held

some major class office or a

major office in a church group.

“We Are Hoods, Not Brothers”

Deer Editor:

“Greek Week” draws to a
close, and with its end comes
the realization that we David-
son boys have once again re-
sisted change, even when
change meant emerging from a
morass of stupidity.

Only the name was changed:
the sounds on the fraternity
court were sounds of Hell
Week, of shouting brothers and
grunting pledges, the shouted
cadences of pledges marching
with no place to go.

And again the brothers at-
tempted to justify it by re-
peating the worn and im
plausible arguments: “tt
makes men out of them,” or
“WW builds up the brother-
hood,” or even, “The pledges
enjoy every minute of itt”

PEANUTS

What's the matter with us?

We make a verbal fetish of
“Brotherhood” during Rush
Week, and we make a mockery
of it during Hell Week.

We produce some lofty ora-

tory about the “high ideals” of.

fraternity life, and then we

deny every high ideal, in a

week-long orgy in the mud.
We nod assent when the

Inter-fraternity council calls
for “constructive activity,”
for we know that almost any

activity can be called con

structive if we spend a little
time rationalizing it.

And this is the most. glaring
hypocrisy of all: we glibly criti-
cize those who control David-
son College, for they are “un-
progressive.” And then we fose
ourselves in the most unpro-

gressive and cruel activities we
can dream up. And this, curi-
ously, is all in the name of
“brotherhood.”

Brotherhood? We're hoods,
not brothers. Not brothers,
unless brotherhood is a cheap
commodity bought with stu-
pidity and immaturity and
self-delusion. Not brothers,
uniess the brand of brother-
hood we produce is inferior,
worth no more then a few
push-ups in the mud, a raw
egg and an aimless march
sround the campus.

Greek Week has been a fail-
nre; Tell \Week has been a roar-
ing suece.s. The change in
name was just mute proof that
the road to Hell Week was
paved with good intentions.

SALMAGUNDI

Toumaras’ Swan

song: | Am

Glad”

By JOHN TOUMARAS

Last week this page contained an editorial calling
for the advocates and opponents of an integrated Da-
vidson to marshal their arguments and prepare an intel-
lectual and moral foundation for their beliefs. The rea-

son for this was that sooner
ply for admission.

Perhaps there are no -moral and

or later a Negro would ap-

intellectual

grounds for denying the application of a qualified Ne-
gro student, but there is a practical or reasonable basis

for refusal.

A Negro student may get along very well in the

classroom and Student Union,

and he may be tolerated at

campus activities, but will he be given the opportunity
to enjoy all the. rights, privileges, traditions, benefits, and
customs of a Davidson student? Only the student body
can guarantee this opportunity. Will they do so next year .

or in ten years? I do
s * s- @

not think so.

Many are asking if the Peon Army will march this
year. Unless an act of God or of the Executive Commit-
tee intervenes, the Peons will march. General Red of
SHPAD states that this year’s parade will contain cavalry,
an international brigade, and, perhaps, an air-force.

In eighty days another school year will draw to a
close, and another graduating class will leave the ma-

ternal confines of Davidson

and head into the Abyss.

Reviews, chapel, Vespers, Hattie’s, and the Union coffee

will become memories.

No doubt each graduate will ask himself and his
fellows if the four years were well-spent, if anything
of value were attained and retained, if the end product
justified the sacrifices made in order to transform
the raw material, and if there is any hope for the fu-

ture.

These questions are not unique. They have been
asked in the past and they will be asked in the future.
Their answers remain the same. Yes, my little die-cast,

well-turned Davidsonian, the

years were well-spent; you

are a unique product; there is hope.

THE PHILOSOPHES

Summary of

For New Council

By DAVID ROBINSON

The following is a collection
of ideas expressed in recent
discussions and conversations
concerning the institution of
Student government at David-
son and the role of that insti-
tution in the coming year.

e e 2 s °

Several principles operate or
should operate in our system.
Rather than adopt the too often
prevailing attitude that what
governs best governs least, we
should seek a program which
best combines the fulfiliment.
of the interests of the student
body with the wisdom of au-
thority.

We are both an academic
community of faculty and stu-
dents, and a democratic com-
munity of students and student
council; the two- will of neces-
sity conflict in certain areas,
but nonetheless must seek con-
stant interrelation.

HONOR COUNCIL

The creation of an Honor
Council points to a philosophy
of leadership. There is ade-
quate leadership on the campus
to handle the functions of this
additional body without any de-
crease in the quality of work.
Leadership duplication should
be avoided if possible, and
leadership development become
a more primary concern. Con-
centration of effort and time
should replace concentration of
leadership as a theme of cam-
pus activity.

GREATEST CHALLENGE

Many problems face student
government in‘the coming year;
they are of both a general and

Ideas |

a specific nature. The increase
in and improvement of com-

munication between faculty and

Students through the student
council and between this latter
body and the students them-
selves is the greatest challenge
ahead.

COMMUNICATION

If communication is a peren-
nial problem, the need fort
creativity on the part of the
1958-59 student council is ;
unique and particular one. The
inability to specify the new ax-
tivities of the council will make
greater its inclination to relax.

Another area of concern is
the gap between faculty and
Student body regulations | on
certain issues and between
theory and practice on all
levels. The merits of both am-
biguity and hypocrisy relative
to the consequences of their re-
moval must be considered.

DousT

There is some doubt as to
whether we are responsible for
our own constitution and
whether student body expres-
sion or action has any signifi-
cance for the other and more
ultimate authorities of the
community.

The specific tasks of student
government will be consider.
able. In the area of theft and
theft control, a decision may
be necessary to institute a sys-
tem of fingerprinting or locked
doors; if neither of these is
adopted, a stronger program of
the present type will have to
be implemented. Freshman ori-
entation and the function of
the Court of Control should be
revised somewhat. The Honor
Court should develop effective
judicial procedures

The student council should
consider the questions of af-
filiation with some national
body, a possible change in the
system of chapel services, the
possibility of readmitt nce for
a student expelled for an honor
violation, and the realm of
school spirit and support:
