WAKE FOREST
TOMORROW

RA CASKIE NODVELL 3.

The Turkey Day classic of the
“Big Five” will be staged in Char-
lotte tomorrow, when the Wild-
cats of Davidson College take on
the Demon Deacons of Wake For-
est in their annual imbroglio. Feel-
ing is at a fever pitch, and each
eleven is out to put it on the other.
Last year Davidson broke a ten-year

jinx, when they licked the Dekes, 7-0,
on Richardson Field. There are a
goodly number of Deacons playing
tomorrow who remember seeing
Charlie Pearce intercept their pass and
race 53 yards for a touchdown; and
then watching Bruce Peabody convert
for the first Davidson victory over
Wake Forest since 1921.

Playing their last game in the
Red and Black moleskins of Da-
vidson will be Captain Charlie
Rives, Alternate Captain Percy
McElrath, “Schnozz” Willson,
Wee and Tee Thompson, Brewster
Grant, Parks Harrison, and A. W..
Rice. Of these men three are reg-
ulars, Rives, McElrath, and Will-

These men will close bril-
liant. careers in North Carolina
football circles, and all should
come in for some sort of recogni-
tion when the all-state pickers get
together.

The Davidson and Wake Forest
bands will both be on hand, and the
usually colorful crowd is expected. The
Wake Forest and Davidson student
bodies will attend en masse to cheer
their team on to victory. The David-
son supporters are confident of victory.

On any basis you pick it, Da-
vidson is the team to predict for
the victory. Davidson’s splendid
record of only two losses, those to
the powerful North Carolina team,
6-0, and the Pasadena-bound Duke
gridders, 19-7; combined with a
tie, and five victories, makes them
favorites. The ’Cats played the
formidable N. C. State gridsters,
who were only downed 7-0 by
Duke, to a 6-6 tie. However, the
Wake Forest ‘boys also tied State,
their affair ending 0-0. Davidson
victories are: Elon, .6-0; Wofford,
28-13; V. M. I., 6-0; The Citadel,
24-6, and William and Mary, 12-7.
Wake Forest has no such impressive

record, having been dubbed _ the
“Scoreless Wonders.” Paper and pen-
cil figuring is a poor way to compare
teams, but for the satisfaction of so
many who like to compare them this
way, here is how Davidson and Wake
Forest stack up on paper. Wake For-
est lost to Clemson, 13-0. Clemson
was defeated by Wofford, 14-13, and
licked The Citadel, 7-0. Now, David-
son licked Wofford, 28-13, and The
Citadel, 24-6, making them a good bit
superior to the Deacons on this basis.

Davidson plans to put its full
strength on the field, and the
state’s best backfield, composed of
the ubiquitous Mackorell, the
speedy Wingfield, the  elusive-
Hutchins, and the dapperling Will-
son, will be ready to give those big
Deacon linemen a day of it. How-
ever, Swan, DeAngelis, Swing, and
Chetty are powers to be reckoned
with, and the Davidson line is go- «
ing to have no simple afternoon
opening holes for those great ball
carriers, but this column again
goes on record as picking the
Wildcats to win.

Looking around the world of foot-
ball, we come first to the neat way in
which the N. C. State Wolfpack held
the Duke gridders, 7-0. We noticed
where Nick Laney led the yardage for
the mighty Duke backfield. The high-
ly-touted Army team caught a tartar,
but managed to squeeze through for a
12-7 victory over Navy. Princeton, the
East’s claim to glory, continued it’s
victorious march over Rutgers, 26-6.
However, Rutgers accomplished what
eight other opponents failed to do,
score on the Tigers. Georgia nailed
Georgia Tech, 7-6, in that annual
classic in the Peach State. Southern
California nipped Notre Dame, 19-0,
and Stanford sewed up the Rose Bowl
bid, licking California, 7-3.

SOUTH ATLANTIC
PLAYERS NAMED
BY DAVIDSONIAN

Duke Places Three Men While
Other Schools Place One

MACKORELL RATES TEAM

Star Quaterback Only Davidson
Man on Team

With the picking of an all-eastern
team by Jock Sutherland, Pitt coach,
the open season on all-star football
teams was inaugurated. At this time
“The Davidsonian,” through its sports
editor, has seen fit to select an all-
South Atlantic team.

Players have been selected from any
school that is in the territory of the
Southern Conference, regardless of
whether their school is a member of
the conference or not. Most sports
writers select “only conference players,
thereby unfairly neglecting splendid
players in other institutions. In this
selection “The Davidsonian” plans to
give those who deserve it a break, and

puts out this team on that basis. It
follows:

Wsreks ocecouedsee Hancock (V. M. I.)

Q. B. - =Mackorell_ (Davidson)

IRR Misuse csancs Clary (South Carolina)

x

aback Quarterman (The Citadel)

On the flanks, Charlie Hancock, of
Virginia Military Institute, and Tom
Rogers, versatile Duke end, get the
call. Hancock has played bang-up ball
all season, his play against Davidson
being particularly outstanding. Tom
Rogers is the better of a pair of ex-
cellent flankmen, and has been con-
spicuously mentioned as an all-Ameri-
can prospect. Other good ends in this
section were Brandt, North Carolina;
Morgan, of Davidson, and Smith, of
Washington and Lee.

Duke’s mighty Freddie Crawford
undoubtedly gets one tackle berth, and
the other has been awarded to Pat
Swan of Wake Forest. Crawford's
play during the current season has
been of the highest calibre, and he
will, no doubt, make many all-Ameri-
can teams. As a running mate, the
Deacon“stalwart, Pat Swan, is a good
choice, as this big 235-pounder is—fast
and aggressive, and is death at smear-
ing line plays. It was hard to leave
off men like Ogilvie of The Citadel,
Durner of Duke, and “Berger of Vir-
ginia.

m1

One guard, George Barclay of North
Carolina, was outstanding, but the
other was hard to choose. After much
consideration, Virginia’s Dial was
chosen over a host of good men, in-
cluding DeAngelis of Wake Forest,
Potter and Captain Rives of Davidson,
Captain Shock of Duke, and Stanko
of N. C. State. The two chosen ap-
peared to be better all-argund linemen
than the rest, and thereby gained the
berth over those who were especially
adept in their particular line of play.

In Dunlap, one of two famous
brothers, who play side by side, the
Blue Devils of Duke University pre-
sent easily the best center in this neck
of the woods. His passing, and his
other offensive play, coupled with his
able work on defense, go to land him
this place on the team. McElrath,
pivot man for the Davidson Wildcats,
came in for consideration, but injuries
have kept him out so much of. the sea-
son that the palm goes to Dunlap.

This section of the country was lit-
erally overstuffed with good backfield
material. In Johnny Mackorell, no one
will deny, Davidson had the outstand-
ing back in the South Atlantic district.
This boy behind a heavy line would
be unstoppable, and he gets our vote
for first place as the field general.
Need we say he is triple threat? Men
like Horace “Horse” Hendrickson, of

Duke, and Carolina’s fine punter,
“Pepper” Martin, and Mattox of
Washington and Lee, are all good

qarterbacks, and deserve special men-
tion.

Three halfbacks were given posi-
tions on the team, when Quarterman,
The Citadel’s fine punter, was given
the fullback berth over Ray Rex of
N. C. State, and “Schnozz” Willson,
of the Wildcats. At the two halfback
posts we find Sawyers of Washington
and Lee, and Earl Clary of South Car-
olina, Sawyers, playing on a fine team,
has led them to some great victories,
and has made two touchdown runs of

over 80 yards against major competi-

won him his place.

Wrestling Workouts
Started Last Week

At present ten new men and four
old ones are out for varsity wrestling ;
as soon as football is over there will
be at least eight more, most of whom
are veterans.

» In practice for the past week Coach
Unger has been spending most of his
time with the lighter weights, but as
soon as football is over he hopes to
begin to work more with the heavy-
weights.

A meet with Appalachian College is
being planned for December 18, After
the holidays the matmen will take a
trip into Virginia where they will
meet Washington and Lee on Janu-
ary 12, and V, M. I. on January 13
at Lexington. On February 3 they
will meet V. P. I. at©Blacksburg.

All of the meets scheduled with Big
Five opponents will be held on home
ground. Duke comes here the tenth,
Carolina the sixteenth, and State the
twenty-fourth of February.

Unger stated that he was
very well pleased with the work of
the squad, especially with that of the
men. Unger requests that any-
one weighing less than 130 pounds in-
terested in wrestling to see him as

Devils Down N. C. State, 7-0;
Citadel Defeated; Elon
Tied

With the close of the football season
drawing near, a season highly suc-
cessful for Davidson, the Wildcats’
1933 opponents met varying fates in
some of the last games of the year
Saturday.

Duke’s championship team, led by
Nick Laney, clinched in Saturday’s
game the Big Five title, went into a
tie with the South Carolina Game-
cocks for the possession of the South-
ern Conference flag, and advanced
nearer still to the’ goal of an unde-
feated season.

But N. C. State put up a whale of
a fight against the  highly-touted
Devils, rising to unexpected heights,
and held the desperately fighting Blue
Devils to a 7-0 win.

Although the Duke team by statis-
tics showed a great deal more power
than the Wolfpack, garnering nine
first downs to their opponents’ two,
they lacked-the final punch to put the
pigskin over. The State team showed
an unusual spirit, playing inspired ball
in her gallant goal-line stands.

The Citadel went down in defeat be-
fore a powerful Clemson Tiger Satur-
day, as Jess Neely’s boys showed new-
found power to the
Bulldogs, 7-0.

The victory was more complete than
it might sound by the score, for the
Tigers ran up 17 first downs to The
Citadel’s 2, and gained 301 yards from
scrimmage to their opponents’ 35, only
to be stopped several times on the
very goal line Bulldog
stand.

In the last game of the season for
both teams, Guilford tied Elon Satur-
day in one of the biggest upsets of
the North State Conference, coming
through in the last period with. two
touchdowns to knot_ the count at
13 to 13.

MIDDIES DOWNED
BY ARMY CADETS
IN CLOSE SCRAP

Huge Crowd of 79,000 Sees Navy
Bow Before Army, 12-7

CLARK STARS FOR NAVY

Spirit Runs High at Traditional
Contest

Before a crowd of 79,000, the Mid-
shipmen of the United States Naval
Academy bowed to the Cadets of West
Point in a hard-fought football game
last Saturday. Although the Middies
put up one of the best and gamest
fights of the season, the Cadets over-
powered them and won by the score
of 12 to 7.

The traditional rivalry was evidenced
greatly at the game Saturday, with
both of the student bodies present to
encourage their team to victory. In
keeping with the time-honored cus-
tom, both academies put on a short
but perfect exhibition of drilling dur-
ing the half rest period. The exhibi-
tion of each school was received with
about the same amount of applause.
The sensational punting of Bill
Clark, Navy back, saved the Midship-
men from losing by a larger score.
The star halfback for the Navy agegre-
gation, Chung-Hoon, a native Ha-
waiian, did not see service in this
clash because of a knee injury suf-
fered in the Princeton game on No-
vember 11. All through the game a
fighting spirit was manifested by the
Navy squad that discouraged the
Army mule several times. But the
game turned out the way it did be-
cause the mule kicked harder and
more consistently than the goat butted.

Buckler, the probable all-American
halfback for the Army, scored on a
25-yard run through the center of the
hard-fighting Navy forward wall. The
otHer score was made in the early
stages of the game on an 8l-yard run
by Johnson. This run was the return
of one of Clark’s kicks.

This game, which showed more
drive and tfick plays since the two
teams played to a 21-21 tie in 1926, saw
the Navy suffer defeat for the fifth
