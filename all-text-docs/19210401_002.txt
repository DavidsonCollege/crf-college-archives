THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 1, 1921.

Diamond Dust

Did you see—in the first game with
Oak Ridge, the catch made by Shepard
of Sizemore’s long high fly?

— More Pep—

Did you see—Ratchford jump about
six feet up into the air and spear one
that looked good for two bags.

—More Pep—

Did you see Crawford hit one good for
a trip around to the hot corner and then
forget that first base had to be touched
on the way around.

—Wildcate—

The Presbyterian apple throwers (and
chewers) have not been wielding the
stick very effectively. This accounts for
the absence of the batting averages ‘in
this issue. Watch for them next week.

—Wildcate Forever—

Fellows, put more pep, more volume,
more enthusiasm, into the rooting and
cheering. Don’t make the cheer leader
wear himself out asking for pep. It
helps the team to hear a big yell boom-
ing out over the field when there is a
man on base. Help them play air-tight
ball by backing them up.

—Don't forget the Wildkittens—

The first track meet comes this week,
and we will then see what the Wildcat
Varsity Track Team has always been
noted for—speed, endurance,—and grit.

—It is an honor to be a Wildkitten—

The oval around the diamond has been
put in good shape and this cinder-path
will be the scene of some thrilling strug-
gles this spring.

—Pep and More Pep—

The following is the schedule for this
week’s games in “Tarheelia”:

April 1—N. C. State vs. Elon at Raleigh.
W. and L. vs. V. P. I. at Blacksburg.
April 2—Trinity vs. Wake Forest at

Durham.

U.N. C. vs. U. Va. at Charlottesville.
April 4—Davidson vs. Wofford at David-

son.

Lenoir College vs. Wake Forest at

W. F.

U.N. C. vs. W. and L. at Lexington.
April 5—Wofford vs. Trinity at Durham.

N. S. State vs. Wake Forest at Wake

Forest.

April 6—Maryland State vs. N. C. State
at Raleigh.

MUCH NEEDED IMPROVE-
MENTS MADE AT
ATHLETIC FIELD

Peanuts! popcorn! and cracker jacks {
ice cold Coco-Cala! cigars! cigarettes!
and chewing gum! Did you hear that?
Wasn't it music to the ear? No longer
will the ardent fan put a gravel in his
mouth to keep his throat from closing
up. He will drink a bottle of “pop” and
yell louder. Then when the Wildcats are
well lubricated and running to our
hearts’ content we will add further to
the pleasure by smoking a good cigar.
Why should we care for expenses? We
are helping out the Athletic Association
which is supporting the team.

Hats off to the managers of the Athlet-
ic Association. Those fellows think of
everything for our pleasure. Of course
you notice the wire around the bleach-
ers. No longer is it necessary to wear
a chest protector and a catcher’s mask
while watching the game. We can now
take the fair one out to watch a real ex-
hibition of baseball and feel perfectly
safe from all fout balls. With these im-
provements we can see every game in
safety and comfort and devote all our
energies to backing the team.

second. McGirt scored when McLaugh-
lin went out Cassell to Barnette. Oak
Ridge scored again in the seventh. Phil-
lipe got a pop hit just out of Cassell’s
reach, and Sizemore sacrificed him to
second. He went to third on McGirt’s
hit through short and hung up a coun-
ter when Wrenn dropped Miley’s throw
of Hood’s bounder.

After two were gone in the first Craw-
ford sent a rip-snorting, three-ply blow
to deep right. With Shepard, Cassell and
Wrenn just itching for a swat at the
old apple, things looked ripe for a few
tallies for the Wildcats. But Jim Black
failed to' see Pat touch first on his gal-
lop around the hassocks and the lights
went out for Davidson.

But the smiling Irishman came right
back in the seventh and started the old
merry-go-round again. He sent a long,
high fly to center that Rouse misjudged
and when the crowd quit yelling long
enough to come up for air, “Pat” was
perched on the third station.
fouled off to Hood, but Pat brought in a
slice of the bacon when Sizemore let
Cassell’s hot one get away from him.

Two perfectly good base knocks by
Shepard and Cassell were wasted in the
fitth when Shepard was caught napping
at first, and Cassell was left stranded at
the half-way hut, when Wrenn thrice
cut the ozone and Barnette saw three
go by that. looked good to Black.

Shepard furnished the fielding feature
of the game when he pulled Flowe's
liner off his shoe-strings, a la Tyrus et
Tris. Cop Johnston batted for Neal in
the eighth and brought the crowd to its
fect by sending one with whiskers on it
through Flowe's legs. Cop claims it was
a hit but the scorer couldn’t see it that

way.

Carolina Game

The University of North Carolina
opened their baseball season success-
fully last Monday afternoon by defeat-
ing Davidson at Prince Albert Park,
Winston-Salem, by a score of 7 to 3;
Lowe of Carolina hitting a home run in
the ninth inning with bases full.

The contest was a pitcher's battle
from beginning to end, with both teams
playing along pretty close together un-
til the last part of the ninth when the
unusual event happened.

Davidson got under way in the second
inning. when Shepard placed the ball
over the left field fence for the first
home run of the game.

Carolina came to bat and Shirley hit
to third and was safe on an error; he

was sacrificed to second and scored with

Spruill when the latter hit a hot
grounder to center, the ball slipping
through Crawford's hands and rolling

to the fence.
Carolina scored again in the fourth

when Lewellyn singled to center field

and then came home on a two base hit

to right center by Spruill who was
thrown out at second when attempting

to steal,
Davidson netted her second point in

the sixth frame by a hit over second
base by Ratchford, followed by a hit

Shepard |.

He parked one Monday.

over the third baseman’s head by Brown,
after which Cassell bunted out at first.
Crawford walked; Wrenn hit to third
and Ratchford came home when the
first baseman fumbled the ball, dropping
a throw. Brown was thrown out when
trying to score the third run.

In the cighth Davidson scored an-
other point when Cassell succeeded in
hiding the ball from the umpire by a hit
which resulted in ball’s disappearance in
a hole in the fence. This point tied the
score at 3 and 3. Crawford went out by
a fly to center field and Wrenn by a
foul fly.

The real fire-works began for Caro-
lina in the ninth. Shepard received a
grounder and threw the first man out.
The next man up wdlked. Lewellyn ad-
vanced Shirley to second when hit on
the arm. These two were advanced by
Spurill’s fly to center field. Lowe came
to the bat with the bases full and after
having two balls and one strike called
hit the ball squarely and it flew over
left field fence, netting a home run for
him and scoring the other three men.

The game was a pitchers’ battle from
beginning to end. Davidson proved her-
self superior in the fielding, and both
sides succeeded in getting seven hits to
their credit. Shepard pitched a fine
game. Wrenn was there with a peg to
second every time a steal was attempted.
Freeman made two hits.

For Carolina Spruill ted in the hitting,
and although a little wild at times Wil-
son pitched a good game. His support
was fine at most stages of the game.

SOCIETIES DEBATE PLAN OF
WORLD DISARMAMENT
Discussions i by More
Than Usual Spirit.

Phi Society

The “head liner” of the Phi meeting
lost Thursday night was a debate on the
subject, “Resolved that the plan for dis-
armament suggested by Senator Borah
should be adopted.” The participatants
were ‘Taylor, Brown, R. H., and Wool
on the affirmative, and Brown, E. D.,
Hill, and Query on the negative.

Two main points formed the basis of
the affirmative argument: First, that im-
mediate disarmament is necessary;
second, that it is the duty of England,
Japan, and the United States to follow
Borah’s plan in doing this.

The impossibility, the impracticability,
and the unwisdom of disarmament ac-
cording to Senator Borah’s plan com-
posed the negative’s contentions. How-
ever the affirmative took the decision
by a two to one vote of the judges.

An extemporaneons debate on the
subject, “Resolved, that intercollegiate
debaters should be permitted to wear the
‘D’,” was staged by Robertson and Frick-
er; the affirmative won. D. R. Freeman
closed the literary program with an
oration of unusual merit on “Happiness.”

Eu Society.

The Eu Society held its regular meet--

ing last Saturday night, undisturbed for
one time by the movies. The question
for debate was, Resolved, That Senator
Borah’s plan for disarmament should be
adopted. This question which was very
appropriate was upheld by the follow-
ing men: affirmative, Elkins, Lowry, and
Team; negative, James McCutchen and
McCaskill. The debate, taken , as a
whole, was full of “pep” and much in-
terest was manifested in it.

LITERARY SOCIETIES OFFER
MEDALS IN ANNUAL ESSAY

CONTESTS

Each of the Davidson Literary Soci-
eties presents a medal for the best essay"
submitted in the annual Eu and Phi
contests, The winning of an essay
medal has always been considered one of
the greatest honors a student can ob-
tain, and in consequence much rivalry
has attended these contests. ,

April the fifteenth is announced as the
closing date of the Eumenean Essay
Contest this year. It is hoped that
many men will try for the medal as the
entrance of an essay means a society
credit. That every man has a chance,
is shown by the fact that a freshman
won this medal last year.
