ALL ROADS LEAD TO

The concert given at Queens Col-
‘lege last Saturday night by the com-
bined Band and Glee Club was cer-
tainly one that would reflect a great
deal of credit on any college, and it
was loudly applauded. There were
at least 35 Davidson men on the
' program and it is estimated that 50
‘or a hundred more went out to hear
‘the concert and attend the subse-
quent reception. As for the Queens
College girls, a mere glance at the
‘center and right sections of the au-
ditorium sufficed to prove their ap-
| preciation of the program.
The first number was “College
| Ties,” by the Glee Club. This was
followed by two inspiring selections
'from the Band. A piano solo by
Tremain came next, followed with a
song by the Glee Club and a solo by
Fred Justus. Cathey then gave one
‘of his inimitable performances, with
pa large number of jokes and ended
with a clog dance. He seemed to
enjoy himself immensely, as he re-
fused to leave the stage when the
quartet appeared and added quite an
‘amusing scene to the program by
singing with them. After a few
more excellent selections by the
Band and the Glee Club, the concert
was concluded by a rousing render-
jing of “O Davidson,” given by both
{the Band and the Glee Club, at
, Which the audience rose to show
their respect for the college.

Our Dr inks Queens left nothing undone that

would increase the enjoyment of the
evening. The halls and parlors of
the administration building were
beautifully decorated and every-
thing was done to make the visitors
feel at home.

Delicious refreshments of ice
‘cream and punch were servel by the
young ladies of the Finishing
[Senos who’ proved as ardent sup-
| porters of the Red and Black as the
'*“Oueens” themselves.

The great tragedy of the even-
ing was the fact that so many of the
Davidson boys had to take an early
departure in order to catch the “spe-
cial” for Home, Sweet Home. To
them it seemed like a crime and a
large number wilfully and willingly
| failed to catch the special.

The Davidson students are deeply
indebted to those of Queens for the
royal goud time given them. Their
appreciation was aptly expressed by
the exclamation of one on departing
when he said: “Gee, but | wish Da-
vidson was co-ed.”

was desired that the gift be as rep-
resentative of ‘the American people
as possible. Accordingly, each indi-
vidual was asked to give any
amount he wished—preferably five
or ten cents. Louis P. Good, who
had charge of collecting the money
at Davidson College, reports the
canvass a great success, having col-
lected $29.53. This is an average of
about seven cents for each man in
the student body. The gifts, how-
ever, ran from one cent to one dol-
lar and about 347 students gave
their “bit.” He attributes the suc-
