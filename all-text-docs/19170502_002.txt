THE BLANKET FEE.

— The Blanket Fee scheme will soon
sec its birthday. It has done great things
for our student body—especially as far
as the publications are concerned. Every
student gets his volume of Quips aud
Granks. ‘The Magazine is no longer
the protege of the literary sucicties. It
has a wider circulation and is read by a
larger appreciative list of readers. Then
the college paper comes in—every stu-
dent gets it—and gets it at a loss of
about 15 cents per subscription to Tie
DavmpsoNIAN.

Next year the price of this paper will
be $1.25. We are not doing this merely
to keep pace with the high cost of living.
It is a matter of necessity. We cannot
give to you the same paper for the same
price. The ideal to which we strive is
to give you about thirty issues of a six-
page paper, and to give you a six-page
paper in every number. Neither is the
price being raised as a money proposi-
tion. ‘This is under the control of the
student body, and we do not seek to
make excess funds. But we must have
the paper on a firm financial basis—
hence the rise in price. It has been pos-
sible at the present price to only par-
tially issue a six-page edition thruout
the year.

The circulation manager is planning
to greatly enlarge our subscription lis.
and to carry the name of Davidson to
new fields where it is now partially
known. We trust that individual stu-
dents will aid him in this extension
work. And we further trust that th.
alumni will give us their continued sup-
port.

THE MUSICAL HOUR.

The musical hour on next Friday
afternoon in Shearer Hall, beginning a
§:30, is the result of the synthesis of
ideas. From the library we received the
idea of “campus singing.” From the
Forum we were asked about the new
college song. On last Friday afternoon
we heard the willingness of the band to
furnish some good music.

Next Friday the band and orchestra
will give a free concert. There will
also be some selections from the quar-
tet. The new colleze song will be
practiced and patriotic songs will be
sung by the whole gathering. Students

and townspeople are urged to be then
2tomptly at §:30 and take part in thi.
velightful hour.

One thing included in an ideal schem.
af education is music. ‘lo a great ex
-ent here this is lacking and is the faul.
uf the student. At least, in the futur.
.t will be. ‘he band wants to do all 1.
-an to remedy this. Now it is eviden:
chat we should back it up—back it up
for two reasons—because we need a
pand and it cannot exist without sup-
port, and we should support it because
its function is altruistic, it aims to fur-
nish what is lacking in our own educa-
tion. We are glad to quote “Iddie”
Childs when he says: “One thing we
need to bring college spirit to what if
should be is to have a band!”

‘There is no reason why we should not
meet for an hour a week from now until
Commencement. {The band will co-
operate. ‘hen let’s all come and learn
some new songs and invigorate our pa-
triotic souls by singing the time-honored
airs. ‘I'his is free to all and you are
urged to come.

We often complain that the past was
not careful in leaving a record of itself
for the future. “Ihis criticism is just.
We cherish the history of our societies,
of our college, and of our Nation—this
history is almost sacred. How glad we
would be if in some far-away, dusty
nook or corner a thread of history of
Davidson could be found which is not
known. How glad we would be if
among the themes of the English de-
partment an autobiography of President
Wilson could be found.

We are not a provident people. With
all newspaper records and other literary
legacies which will exist a century from
now this age will be hazy. The Senior
doubtless thinks he has enough to do.
A great deal is required for graduation.
But one important thing he does not do
—he does not leave an autobiugraphiy.
It would be a good plan if this was re-
quired. it should be of a sufficient
number of words to give an account ot
his life. When the present Junior class
were Freshmen they were required to
write an autobiography. Doubttess these
are filed away with the records of the
English department. “This was an ex-
cellent idea to have them written. But
how much better it would be if each
present Junior at the end of his Senior
year would get and rewrite it. He
could give some of the determining in-
fluences of his life which he did aot
know existed when it was originally
written, ‘The attitude a college man
takes toward the world during his course
will, to a large extent, with a few rare
exceptions, determine what his future
shall be. The college should have a rec-
ord of his pre-college life as well as his
college life. And the latter record
should be an exposition of the influences
his associates, the faculty, and the train-
ing have exerted upon him.

The college record shows the record,
but not the mind. Who knows whose
biography will be written? It would be
good for a man to think about what is
making the man of him. Then when
the biographer of a Davidson man went
to work he would have an invaluable
source of first-hand information. Let's
make this criticism of being a non-provi-
dent people an unjust one.

DECLAMATION CONTEST

Commencement exercises of the Pub-
lic School will be held on the night of

a recent preliminary contest and are as
follows: Annie Lois Barnett, Jessa-
man Brown, Sara Hamilton and Mar-
tha Hamilton were the girls, and Craig-
head Alexander, John Barnett, McDow-

Just
A Little
Different

D of the direct advantages to be gained from
printing that will catch the eye and hold it long@
enough to create a favorable attitude on the part of
the buying public? Printing of the ordinary kind
has become so weatherbeaten by unlimited usage
that the impression formed in the mind of the busi-
ness man of to-day is one of continuous and depress-
ing sameness—a tendency to’ cause a “‘look-
around-more’’ disposition on the part of him who
wants something just a little different, if not entirely
distinctive, when compared with the current station-
ery that reaches his office.

We invite a careful and studied analysis of the
samples we always keepon hand for your inspection.
It is the aim and purpose of each unit that goes to
make up the Presbyterian Standard Publishing Co.
to lend every effort possible to satisfy a customer
absolutely. A thorough test will furnish any proof desired.

Let us quote you priceson any printing that is ordinarily —or extraordinarily—
ased in the modern 4.

CAMPUS IMPROVEMENTS.

Spring has brought the regular im-
provement of the campus. Dead limbs,
reminder of winter, have been removed

from the trees, other minor improve-
ments along with the trimming of the
trees have added much to the beauty of
the campus. With the co-operation of
all the students in keeping waste paper
from it, the campus will con‘inue to be
one of the greatest attractions of Dav-
idson.,
