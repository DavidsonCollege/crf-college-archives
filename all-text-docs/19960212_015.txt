Wildcat Rugby open season with

By WILL BALDWIN
Staff Writer

Early Saturday afternoon on
the IMAC fields, the Davidson
rugby team opened their spring
season witha victory against South-
west Virginia Community College.

The large crowd was not dis-
appointed as the Wildcats handed
SWVCC a 49-0 loss. Despite the
muddy conditions, Davidson main-
tained possession of the ball for
most of the game. Seven players
scored for the Cats. Bob Yarbrough
and Hank Ackerman led the way
with two tries apiece. Yarbrough
broke several tackles and carried
opposing players into the try zone
for both his scores, while Ackerman
used several cuts against the grain
- and his speéd to score.

Matt Burkhardt and Dave
Derrick each picked up a try by
breaking tackles and busting into
the try zone. Burkhardt also made
two conversion kicks.

During the entire first half, the
Davidson pack manhandled the
Virginia team, pushing them all
over the field. The front line of
Jason Allen, John Spainhour, Mike
Lassiter, and after an injury to
Lassiter, Chris Williams, domi-:
nated their opposition, continu-
ously pushing them over the ball.
The balls the pack wonin the scrum,
as well as those controlled by Will
Baldwin on the line outs, helped
the team keep possesion.

In the second half, Jeremy
Potter, a’95 graduate, scored a try
in his first five minutes back on the
field. Thayer Long, Graham
Powell, and Keith Davis contin-
ued to batter Southwest Virginia
with bruising runs up the gut of the
defense, and Long and Davis
scored in the second half.

Unfortunately, Dunn Mileham
injured his shoulder in his first
ever rugby match. The team hopes
he will be able to return later this
season.

Wildcats

The Davidson Women’s Bas-
ketball team has struggledthe past
couple of weeks, losing to Marshall
87-64 on January 29, Furman 69-
66 on Tuesday, and 86-64 to Ap-
palachian State on Saturday.

drop three in a row, look to regroup

all season. They dominated the
Wildcats offensively, hitting 11
three pointers compared to four by
Davidson. In Marshall’s next
game, they beat nationally recog-
nized Kentucky.

“The Furman game was the
most disappointing loss of the sea-
son,” Filar said.

Defeating the Paladins would

have solidified second place for ~

the Wildcats, but Filar said they
came out flat.
“We’ ve got to come out ready

to play every night. We’ re not tal-
ented enough yet to play with just
a few players ready, we need ev-
eryone to be ready, every night,”
he said.

Against Furman Jennifer
Sanborn scored 15 points, Jennie
Vanlerberghe 13, and Kristen
Ferrucci added 12.

But this, and nine points in the
last: 47 were not enough, as the
Wildcats suffered from several de-
fensive lapses.

“We gave up way too many

easy baskets, our rebounding
wasn’t there, and our inside de-
fense was poor,” Coach Filar said.

Wildcat guard Jennifer
Sanborn emphasized the need for
team play and consistency.

“A couple of players played
well, but we’re not playing as a
team. We need to step up and cut
down on the defensive let-downs.”

On Saturday, Appalachian
State outplayed Davidson. The
first place Mountaineers used an
early 11-0 run to jump out to a 47-

24 halftime lead. The Wildcats
played the Mountaineers even in
the second half, but they could not *
overcome the early deficit.

The Wildcats play at Western
Carolina on Monday, and return
home to face Georgia Southern
Saturday at 7:30. Davidson is now
10-9 overall, and.4-5 in the confer-
ence. ae
Despite the school record of
conference wins, the Wildcats are
disappointed with their recent
lapse.

Wrestling team
loses Harvey
to ankle injury

By JoHNn Rog

Amidst the ice and snow, when
almost everything was canceled
(except classes, of course), the
Davidson wrestlers hit the mat and
fought rival Duke in what prom-
ised to be arough match. But when
all was said and done, the Wildcats
found themselves at the short end
of a 43 - 3 loss.

The team was finally able to
send a healthy lineup to the mat,
but for some reason, the wrestlers
did not perform as they had hoped.

“‘We wrestled very flat. I am
not sure what it was, but the whole
team, even the guys that have been
wrestling very well, didn’t seem to
be into the match,” said Coach
Tom Oddo.

Chip Stewart collected the
only victory, as he decisively de-
feated his Heavyweight opponent.
Jason Deaton, Christian Baker and
Ben Wall all wrestled close
matches, but were unable to over-

come the point margin.

The team traveled to Charles-
ton, SC to wrestle the Citadel on
Saturday, and went on to Georgia
to grapple against Georgia State
and UTC on Sunday. The latter
two programs consistently produce
good wrestlers, so Davidson faced
top notch competition in prepara-
tion for the final few weeks of
wrestling.

However, the team will have
to wrestle without the help of co-
captain Sean Harvey, who severely
sprained his ankle in practice last
week. After finally being cleared
to wrestle by the trainers, Harvey
injured his other leg and might be
out for the season.

This weekend the wrestlers
return home for important matches
against conference foes Longwood
and Campbell. The first match
should start at 9:30 a.m., and the
second at 11:00a.m. With anearly
full lineup, the wrestlers should be
able to compete as a team, but they
will have to do so without Harvey.

stay the same,” Murphy said. “I
don’t believe that athletics is fight-
ing a different battle than any other
part of the school. I think our ob-
jectives are the same. Athletics is a
major part of campus life. That is
what is attractive about the
Davidson experience.”

Davidson funds its athletic
program, but Tech’s athletic de-
partment is autonomous and must
raise its own money through ticket
sales, the media market, and inde-
pendent contributions. He sees
potential for Davidson teams to
create more of their own revenue.

“There are always going to be
needs and there are alternative ways
of funding,” the new AD said. “Any
additional dollars could take pres-
sure off the general budget of this
school.”

Murphy believes that media
coverage will bring increasing rev-
enues to Davidson, especially as
the men’s and women’s basketball
and soccer teams continue to be-
come more competitive. He also
sees potential in the growing Char-
lotte sports market.

“Davidson has had tradition
as a basketball school. We are wit-
nessing a return of that tradition,”
Murphy said.

He also cites the importance

of soccer as a growth sport.

“As more and more children
grow up playing soccer, more tal-
ented players will arrive at the col-
lege level. Davidson has an attrac-
tive program that will grow and
improve as the pool of talented
college players expands.”

Murphy sees Davidson’ s suc-
cess in fund-raising and attracting
quality student athletes as a prod-
uct of establishing good relation-
ships with alumni and developing
its reputation as a small school
capable of competing with larger
institutions.

One of the limits Murphy sees
on sports such as wrestling, field
hockey, track, and swimming at
Davidson is the difficulty of find-
ing a full schedule. There are not

many schools in Davidson’s geo- ‘

graphical area that are Division I
and similar in size.

“Most Division I area schools
are in major national conferences
like the ACC,” Murphy said. “It
can be hard to find room in their
schedules to compete in a non-
conference game or match.”

The football team has a geo-
graphical waiver for this reason
and is classified as Division I-AA.

“Davidson is a lone voice cry-
ing inthe wind,” Murphy said about
the school’s non-scholarship foot-
ball program. “We will see a num-
ber of schools moving towards non-
scholarship football. Football has
always meant a lot to Davidson,
and when more programs follow
our example, the program will ben-

efit.” ~

Similar factors inhibit the de-
velopment of new varsity teams
like men’s lacrosse.

“Tt would be a real challenge
to make a reasonable schedule,”
Murphy said.

The gender equity policy of
the NCAA is another powerful
force influencing what sports teams
Davidson fields.

“Terry Holland did a great job
balancing gender equity and I think
we need to work hard to continue
that,” Murphy said about his pre-
decessor.

Murphy believes that as AD at
Davidson it is important to con-
sider the overall experience that a
student has.

“So much depends upon con-
sensus building on anything and
everything. We must strive toward
a common goal,” he said. “It’s
important that I sit and listen and
learn the most I can these next few
weeks,”
