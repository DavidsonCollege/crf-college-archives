Last Sunday the “Y” had Mr. S. Wilkes

Dendy, a graduate of the Presbyterian Col-

lege with the class of 1920, give a decidedly

helpful and practical talk at the vesper
service.
Ernest Milton, introducing the speaker,

stated that Mr. Dendy is known to many of
the men here through his work in four of
the Southern States as field secretary of the
Christian Endeavor. At present he is a
student at Columbia Theological Seminary
and assistant pastor of the Presbyterian
Church in Gastonia, N. C.

Using as his scripture text a part of Mat- |
thew 12:12, “How much then is a man bet-
ter than a sheep,” Mr. Dendy announced that

he would speak on the value and dignity of a!

Coach Monk Younger plenty of good ma-

ease that the Wildkittens defeated the Oak
Ridge boys, 36 to 3, and at all times during
the contest the Davidson backs, aided by a
good line and almost perfect interference,
gained ‘seldom less than eight yards at a
time and more often 15 or more.

The Wildkittens began with a rush and
except for the third quarter, when the sec-
ond string backfield was in, they gained con-
sistently and with ease. Even in that quar-

Richardson, ’14, First to

First Wildcat Victory Over
Carolina

When Lunsford Richardson, Jr. in the
fall of 1910 picked up a University of North
1Carolina fumble and 60
across the Blue and White goal fine,
only won the first Davidson victory over the
Tar Heels but also scored the first point that
ever a Wildcat cleven had made against that
team. After over 10 years of defeats and
one tie the Davidson’ team met
Carolina down on Wearn Field in Charlotte.
It was in that game that Richardson won
his place in the Davidson hall of fame. Un-
fortunate for the Wildeat eleven, that was
the only year that Richardson was at David-
son,

Richardson was a member of the class of
1914, and now, the year of the tenth anni-
