No Promises...

o

As a new staff tikes over a college paper.
it is customary to do two thingy --compli-
ment the retiring staff and promise to do
better than ever before.

We do want_to extend our‘thanks and
appreciation, and, we believe. those of the
entire Student Body. to Dick Vowtes. for the
splendid. work he has done during his vear
as Fditor of The Davidsonian. Few there
are who realize how untiringly and un-
seliishly Dick kes worked, The result te tas
obtained speaks for itseli. None can deny
that under his leadership the paper has been
as good as or betver than it has during any
other year of its litetime of nearly a quar-
ter of a century. We only hope that our

eliorts will measure up to the standard set
by Diek.

As to the second of these customs, we
want to depart irom the usual thing and
make no promises. There have been Edi-
tors who have greatly improved The David-
Sonian, there have been those who have
neither harmed nor helped, and there have
been another kind, we are sorry. to say.
Some have started out with the best of in-
tentions. working industriously; then as
week aiter week went by and it became
simply a matter of “getting the thing out.”
they grew tired of it, especially those who
iound practically all of the load upon their
own shoulders. Difficulties beset the im-
proving of The Davidsonian on every side.
SO we are making no promises.

Let it not be thought by this that we in-
tend to take things casy. We have a num-
ber of ideas whieh ought to bear fruit and
will represent a distinet advanee ii they do.
Frankly. we have been quite surprised dur-
ing the last two wecks by the large number
of students who have eviceed interest in the
papery This is as it should ‘be.

Someone has said that “a college is no
better than its newspaper.” Perhaps this is
going a little too far. but certainly a good
paper, can help mold a better college, for
there are many outsiders who have nothing
with which to measure Davidsen but The
Davidsonian. So. to use a trite, but n€éver-
theless a good expression. “A better Dav-
idsonian for a better Davidson.”

“Appreciation wee

We have been strongly impressed by the
truthfulness of the ofd saying that “Grass in
the other man’s pasture always seems
greenest,” especially in our consideration of
the beauties of Nature. When we want to
see natural beauty, we have the idea that
we must travel to distant places to find it.
The beauty of the familiar seems to be -de-
pressed and overlooked because we see it
constantly. And yet how grossly mistaken
we are! For our present surroundings por-.
tray all the beauty that Nature can afford.

We do not believe we exaggerate when
we say that we are living on one of the most:
picturesque campuses in this state. We are
afforded an excellent opportunity to learn
to appreciate Nature; if only we will avail
ourselves of it. We are told of a student of
this college, who in his senior year, when

ng Manager
ag Manager

less he has an appreciation of the beautiiul.
Our curriculum offers few courses in ap-
preciation! but just now when our campus
is in the inliness of its splendor, we have
matchless opportunity to cultivate a sense
of aesthetic appreciation sucit as we stiould
possess, if only we will.

Davidson has long been noted not only
iot her Wildcat spint, but also tor her beau-
tiiul and pieturesque campus. Lt is alrmast
impossible to spend four years here and not
Jearn to know and feel her spirit. May tt be
said of cach of us when we graduate that
we have also learned to appreciate and en-
Soy her beauty.

Take Heed...

There are in exisience in the student body
practices which we, as Davidson students.
should not allow. These practices are not
regarded in their true sense. but they arc
taken entirely too lightly.

More to the poin:, [ refer to the practice»
of answering the roll calf in classes for an
absent person. and to the practice of sitting
in the church or chapel seat of an absent
person. Ji these practices are viewed in
their proper significance, | am sure you will
agree that they should mot exist and must be
abolished immediately.

ln some of the larger classes there are
‘persons who answer the roll call for an ab-
sentee. Heretofore, this has been regarded
as a joke, and to me it seems that we should
realize exactly what we are doing. In the
analysis this practice is a breach of the Hon-
or system, ft could be regarded as lying—
saving a person is present when he is not.
That violation of the Nonor System is sub-
ject to severe punishment.

In regard to taking another person’s cha-
pel or church seat or to asking someone ©
take your own, in order to prevent your re-
ceiving an absence, the same principles ho'd
true. °

It is the purpose of this editorial to bnag
the existing facts to light in their true as-
pect and to attempt to make the Student
Body conscious of their rea! significance.

It is a challenge to us to stand uo for what
we know to be right and to do away with
these evils.

To Anonymous Writers...

The Davidsonian has always been con-
scientious about publishing letters to the
editor. and we intend to continue this cus-
tom. Flowever, we feel that if the writer is
Sineere and earnest in writing his letter, he
will sign his name to it. If he does not wish
his name published we will print only his
initials or any pen name he desires. But to
show his good faith with us, we ask that he

attach his name to the letter. Thank you.

Dear Editor:

There is one thimg that T woulfl
like to have explained to me, but
find it hard to approach the ques-
tion because. it requires so much
tact.

The question is of niore interest
to the Freshmen, because they are
tore directly concerned, but I am
sure that every upper-classman who
is genuinely interested in the wel-
fare of the school and.in the re-

vival of the Davidson Spirit has
Riven the matter some serious
thought.

It seems impossible to stop the
despicable custom existing among
the Freshmen of permanently bor-
rowing each others’ caps. In my
opinion, it instigates a fecling of
disappointment in the moral stand-
ards of the class. This disappoint-
tent changes into disillusionment,

which worries the individual con-
stantly. Not only that. but the
disillusionment stays with the per-
son for a tong time, In facet, 1

All letters con-

here longer than E had originally
planned to stay at Davidson.

Resides the disillusionment caus-
ed, a slackness sets into the Fresh-
man’s bones, and he says, “Well, my
cap was stolen, so [I guess it's alt
right for me to lift one.” And so
the racket starts. And in my esti-
mation, that is an important reason
for the breakdown of one's school
spirit.

Suggestion? Yes, 1 -have one!
Listen: When the Freshman buys
his cap. have his name (or laundry
number, or a serial number given to
each Freshman_ for the purpose)
printed with marking ink on the in-
side of the cap. Then a monthly
check-up can be made by the Court

of Control to sce that each cap is |

in the proper hands. If a man is
found with someone. else's cap, a
good. long campus sentence can be
given him, and of course, the cap

is returned to its rightful owner.
As far as the check-up goes, it
would not be very hard, because the
seven members of the court should

be able tg do the job in an hour.

Football for the small colleges is
tar froma profitable sport, Oberlin
College's President Ernest H. Wil-
kins reports after a coast-to-coast
survey of the financing of the grid-
iron sport.

Quoting figures that deny the
fact that “football supports the
rest. of the athletic program,” Pres.
Wilkins states that in the 22 col-

deges he surveyed an average deficit

of SI743 resulted from last year's
football schedule.

Current grade-worrying of
college and university seniors
will soon turn to job-worrying, -
a survey conducted in New

Although complete statistics
are unavailable, scattered re-
ports reveal that the job out-
look for 1938's graduates will
be 10 to 50 per cent poorer than
in previous years because bus-
iness is waiting fora trade up-

Another move in the difection of
keeping business in touch with the
times has been made here by the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology and the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation of New York,

Financed by the Sloan foundation
the Institute this June will inaug-
urate a special fellowship study
course designed to give five young
business men on leave from their
jobs a deeper understanding of the
social and economic implications of
their work.

Tn describing the purpose of the
project. a Foundation leader said:
“Today managerial decisions, even
though directed to a limjted group,
often have far-reaching repercus-
sions throughout the entire range of
social and economic tife. Mass
production, large-scale industry and
the growth of_great corporate
structures have brought this about.
Individual decisions of a large num-
ber of independent enterpreneurs,
responsible only for small produc-
tion units, no longer cancel out to a

state of neutrality. On the con-

trary, one decision today may con-

dition the welfare of a community
for a lifetime or more.”

OLD SAYING DISCARDED?

The old saw about opposites at-
tracting cach other in affairs of the
heart is just the exception that
proves the rule, science has decided.

Dr. 1. Lowell Kelly of Connecti-

Tcut State College is piling up evi-

dence that like attracts like-when
it comes to matrimony.

This attraction of NKkes is most
pronounced in the mauer of physi-
cal traits, with blondes being at-
tracted to blondes, athletic men
favoring athletically inclined wom-
en, and men of sedentary inclina-
tions finding small women to their
liking.

Love, on the basis of Dr. Kelly's
findings, affects the judgment of
women more than that of-men. The
women. were inclined to over-rate
their men’s handsomeness, but the
men came closer ta the “inark in
judgifg the beauty of their women.

WEAK-END — The smart boys
were plentiful Saturday afternoon’
with these two cracks being out-
standing : The_first was when a boy
came, up, eyed me very critically
and said; ‘Do you like that suit as
well as the style they are wearing
this year?’ The other was of a sim-
ilar vein with the person changing
his words a little and coming out
with: “Do you think that suit wilt
ever come back in style again?”

WISDOM—The story comes to

Take It Easy

ears about a judge in New Jersey
who: had a young man before him |
on a charge of reckless driving. To
be. specific, for driving with one
arm. After hearing the case he
pondered a moment and then_pro~
nounced a tive dollar fine. After the
fine had been collected he turned
to the boy and said, ‘Next time, my
boy. park the car and do a good

-|job while you are at it.”

PRATTLE—Railcy Williams and
Dave Warden drinking mineral oil
before the track meet. They said
it was to oil up their throwing
arms. Orchids to Mrs. Smith for
instigating the planting of all the
flowers about the campus. (Or
maybe it should be ‘tulips to Mrs.
Smith’), There is a rule and it
should be enforced, about how
horn blowing after seven-o'clock in
the evening. Sometimés it gets
rather bothersome, even bringing
bad dreadful memories of Bunny
Berigan. In passing Iet us say alt
bugle blowers in Scabbard and
Blade are rats of the lowest order.
Ask the track team about the beau-
tiful Tennessee weather. The co-
eds at Maryville can have no dates
whatsoever. Board At Maryville is
only $3.50 a week. Maybe the lack
of boys takes their appetite.

BOWLING—The thing for some-

one to do would be to put a bowling
alley in here at Davidson. With
the boys that bowt in Charlotte and
the ones that go to Mooresville for
the same reason, it would make a
killing. Aside from the fact that
killing is a penitentiary offense and
the fact that the college wouldn't
allow it. it is a cracker-jack idea.
Still though it.is something for
Henry Harkey and Bill Busby to
work over in their minds.
