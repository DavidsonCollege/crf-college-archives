Vol. LXVI, No. EIGHT

Despite the revisions im-
plemented in the course regis-
tration procedure in the fall of
1974, students still encounter
difficulties in obtaining their
desired courses due to conflic-
ting departmental time
blocks.

The present system of
course selection, conceived
and implemented by H. Ed-
munds White, Director of
Admissions and Financial
Aid, was formulated ‘‘in re-
sponse to an expression of
need on the part either of the
student or of the faculty,”’
according to Richard Burts,
Registrar.

This Lock-White procedure
represents an attempt to give
freshman students an equal
opportunity at course selec-
tion.

Under previous systems, all
registration was conducted in
the Chambers Banquet Hall.
Every department was _repre-
sented in the Hall, each at a
separate desk. Students sel-
ected and ranked their six
course preferences, and course
admission was based on sen-
iority—with the seniors being
permitted to sign up for their
full course load first.

It was only after the three
upper classes had registered
for their full course load that
freshmen were allowed to sel-
ect their schedule from the

pes

ly took away (a course)
from pean freshmen that a
freshman may have been truly
interested in,” said Burts.

In 1972, random numbers
were assigned for the first

time. Adding to the effective-
ness of the already computer-
ized process, the random num-
bers assign every senior, jun-
ior, sophomore and freshman a
first course, based on the
student’s preference, and only
then does it assign a second
and finally a third course, in
the same fashion.

“T anticipate no changes in
this (procedure) at all,’”’ com-
mented Burts. ‘‘I think it’s
very satisfactory. It’s not a
schedule, as in the past, but
three schedules with built-in
alternatives.”” Burts further
feels that this procedure’s
effectiveness i increases each
year ‘‘as people become stab-
ilized in it.”

While the Lock-White pro-
‘cedure has greatly reduced the
emphasis on and importance
of seniority, scheduling diffi-
culties still arise in the area of
conflicting course times.

Before the beginning of a
term, each department chair-
man must fill in a blank from
the Registrar’s office delinea-
ting what courses will be
offered and at what time each
course will meet. A cover note
is distributed with the blank
requesting department chair-
men to distribute their courses
over the entire class day.

Despite the note, the 9 am
and 11 am hours are most
frequently chosen by the de-
partmental heads.

Burts sees the time conflict
situation as ‘‘a real problem”’.
“Most teachers and most stu-
dents want to teach and take
classes in the morning. Fur-
thermore, there is a reluctance
on the part of the college to
have the 10 am hour used as a
general class hour,’’ according

Voters in Davidson’s Pre-
cinct One turned out in unpre-
cented numbers Tuesday and
cast generally liberal ballots

~ ‘in national and local races.

Carter took the precinct
with 585 votes over Ford’s
341, and Democrat Arthur
Goodman had 469 as opposed
to 427 for Martin, who won the
Ninth District Congressional
seat.

According to county regi-
strar Mrs. James Alexander,
Sr., approximately 73 percent
of the precinct’s voters visited
the polls. ‘‘The number of
voters — 1013 — was the largest
yet in the eight years I’ve been
here,’’ she said.

According to the Democra-
tic poll-watcher, even though
registered Democrats have a
2-1 edge in numbers, most

Democrats. split their tickets

in order to vote for Martin.

One of Martin’s poll-wat-
chers said, regarding her can-
didate, ‘‘There is great pride
that one of ours has made it.”

On the whole, Davidson
townspeople were reluctant to
reveal their voting preferences
to The D: “One lady,
when queried about her choi-
ces, said, ‘‘I’d better not
say—I’m a -minister’s wife.”
Another townsperson com-
mented, “‘I voted for about as'
many Republicans as Demo-
crats.”’

Davidson students, staff,
and faculty. were more arti-
culate, however, and were
generally ambivalent. Said
one professor, ‘‘I voted ag-
ainst Martin rather than for
Goodman by voting Democra-
tic.” A staff member reflected.
this viewpoint in saying, ‘‘I
pete vote for the Congress-
te because I was

speakers and events and the ~~
Thursday morning Coffee and he

Cokes have been scheduled at
this time.

Burt notes, in addition, ‘‘a
feeling against taking courses
in the afternoon.’’ Students

selves to an afternoon course
because of a possible conflict

not sure that either candidate

‘was that qualified.”’

Another professor revealed
that he voted for Goodman
because he ‘‘wasn’t that
pleased with the way M
has grown in office; he’s
shown far too much receptiv-
ity to special interest groups.”

Concerning the Presidential
race, the above-quoted staff.
member said, ‘‘I think looking’
at what Carter did in Georgia,

best for management. His
intentions are in the right
area.”’

- One professor said that

‘“T’m almost more comfortable

telling you why I’m not voting
for Ford than why I am. voting
for Carter. Mostly socio-econ-
omic problems are involved in
my decision.”

A student, who agreed with
President Ford’s domestic pol-
icies, summed up what seemed
to be a popular opinion when
he said that ‘Ford is the lesser
of two evils.”

Student-faculty interaction

which interaction between the
student body and the faculty
might be improved.

This group, headed by Ro-
ger Brown, was originally the
idea of SGA President Bo
Baskin, but now shys away
from any connection with the
student government. ‘‘We’re
attempting to avoid any sort
of political affiliation,’ said
Brown. ‘‘There are already

tial to attempt to improve

In its first few meetings, the
group has been discussing
possible activities in which
both students and faculty
could participate, such as
faculty entries in the freshman
regatta, free pool games for
student-faculty teams, stu-
dent-faculty covered dish din-
ners and camping or, bike
trips. Brown is especially in-
terested in academically orien-

soon and continue to work as
individuals.

Group member Nancy Cat-
ron commented, ‘‘We want to
motivate others to initiate
contacts with members of the
faculty based on common in-
terests. Our function is not to
actually do the matching up,
but to encourage those who
are interested to do so.”

Brown feels that most pro-
fessors desire increased con-
tact with students but are
restricted by time limitations
and a feeling that what time is
available for students should
be devoted to class members.
He stated, ‘The impression I
get from the faculty members
in the group is that they enjoy
the contact do have with
students ‘and’ appreciate it,
