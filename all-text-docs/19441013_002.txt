Traditions ....

Of all the words hereon the Davidson
campus, few make their appearance so
often as tradition. Few are the things
done without its all-powerful sanction.
From the time a student arrives until he

departs he is either reminding or being ‘

reminded of this ichor that sustains the
spirit of Davidson.

There is no student here that would
wish to do away with the ideals that are
preserved by tradition. They have caus-
ed Davidson to be outstanding. There
are few schools that are so noted for the
high standards of honor, courtesy and
in general all the qualities: ascribed to
the true gefitleman. This is our chosen
way of handing down the best of one
generation of college students to another.

In all groups of society there comes a
time when some of its members feel the
need of engaging in iconoclasm. There is
no person who ‘does not hope that this
will always be unnecessary on the David-
son campus. However, the time has come
when members of the student body are
beginning to feel that this phase of our
_ life has been overstressed. Any person
realizes that when he dares question such

well entrenched standards that he ‘will be
immediately labled as a radical. He can
then. only defend himself by pointing
out in general or in specifically the basis
of his attack. |

In light of this it would be well to ex-
amine the state of tradition and attempt
to define its place in the life of any college.

Tradition is that part of the past which
due to its merit is utilized in the present.
Against it must be balanced progress.
Tradition usually serves as a check on
progress, that is to hold it in reasonable
limits. _ Both have wide value, one can
never be overstressed without injury to
the other.

The time has come when too many
small and unimportant things are being
placed in the category of a hand-down
from the past. Instead of giving logical
reasons for an action one just says “It’s
Traditional.” Some of these are almost
too insignificant to mention. For in-
stance it is traditional that Freshmen stay
off the grass. Many upperclassmen im-
mediately assume that the converse is
also true, that they must never use the
walks when it is possible to walk on the
grass. This unnecessary practice only

~defaces the campus, greatly reduces its

beauty and causes the college to use “psy-
chological” measures to prevent the abuse
to the lawn.

Another tradition which falls in a dif-
ferent class is that of Wilson. One would
be led to think that his stay here was the
greatest influence in his life. In reality
he saw fit only to remain-one year and
practically the only similarity of the col-
lege in that day and this is the name. We
are too proud of a fact that is relatively
unimportant.

~The last type of false use of tradition
that should be pointed out is that type
where its weak backing is given to an ideal
which has much higher reasons behind its
use or practise. One of the most out-
standing is the appeal to the students to
support hall prayer ‘meetings or other

spiritual activity on the basis of its being.

traditional here. If this is the only reason
for such support the thing itself is lower-
ed in its value. In’ fact when any appeal
is based solely on tradition it is hollow
and worthless. There must always be a
present and vital ‘reason for all use of
tradition.

Davidson must always strive to keep its
traditions on a high and noble plane.
There must be no descent to the petty and
unimportant. Traditions die and must be
discarded. The duty of the present is to
place our college life on the high basis
that creates a heritage for the future stu-
dent. We must hold ourselves not only
the preservers but the creators of all the
worthwhile things which college reveals
to the student. We should never cling
toa tanaciously to any one set of rules and
customs. A good past portends a better
future. The past can only be used as a
basis of the future, it can only support
never illuminate. This is the function of
Tradition must be
preserved in a proper balance. with all
other college life.

Gunning

Around

Some people call it humor, but
the only intelligent name for it is
“corn’— meaning, of course, the

jokes of varying caliber which are

thrown out daily to the millions who
read them, hear them, and smell
them. Jokes vary only in subject

» Matter, length, and age, recognizing

the fact that the most important
feature is its source.

There is the old Joe Miller stand-
by:

Who was that lady I saw you
with last night?

That was no lady. That was my
brother. He just. walks that way.

Bob Hope would tell one of his
gags like this:

I. was for several years a choir
boy, ’til one day my voice changed
right in the middle of a beautiful
solo.

Then there is George Burns and
Gracie Allen with their own a
of corn:

Gracie: I did the silliest thing to-
day. I dropped the baby’s blanket
out the window.

George: That was careless. The
baby’s likely to catch pneumonia.

Gracie: Oh, no, he won't. He was
in the blanket.

As you stagger from these con-
sider the college boy who looks on
his: father as the kin you love to
touch. Ones pain grows more severe
when the subject matter of politics
comes up once every four years:

I: What do you think of Roose-
velt's New Deal?

Q: The best thing he’s done since
he organized the Rotigh Riders.
And again:

G: What have you to say about
the progress Dewey is making?

I: Great! I knew his, capture of
Manila would only be

Lemuel. Q. Stoopnagle or
some other genii of our time might
come up with inventions like these:

An alarm clock with half a bell
in it, so when two people are room-
ing together, it just wakes one of
them up. ~

A piano with stationary keys for
people who would rather play the
violin.

A double pipe, for smoking two
kinds of tobacco at the samé time.

A cellophane newspaper that one
can read in a restaurant while ine
watches his hat and coat.
with — phosphorescent
thumbs, for shitch-hiking at night.

Round dice for crap shooters who
would rather play marbles.

If Joe Miller were living today,
he would certainly turn over in his
grave upon reading suclr corn. Be
that ds it may, there is one fact that
everyone should keep in mind and
that is to be able to appreciate a
joke one should be able to take a
joke. This being true I appreciate
jokes because look at all the jokes
I took from somewhere.

This Might
Be You

There. were five of us. We sat in
a dimly lighted room dumbly look-
ing at each other. The only noise’
in the room was caused by two
moths buzzing around the unshaded
light bulb. There we were waiting
to be called into the other room.
Who would go first? What had we
done to deserve this? What would
THEY do? Each of these questions
entered our minds. It was torture, as
it was, in this semi-darkened room,
let alone what would happen to us
later.

Do you know what it is to be left
alone with thoughts; to be afraid
to hear yourself think? That ‘silence
—it was inhuman. Why didn’t some-
body say something? But no, they
were all too busy thinking of their
past wrong doings to speak.

Then I stiffened. The door was
opening. A shadowy figure stepped
through and looked at us. Which
one wil] he take? I wanted to shout,
“Take me. Here I am! LeLt’'s get
it over with.” But something inside
said, “Keep quiet; your turn will
come.”

I watched the boy who was chos-

committed. He must have been about
seventeen years old, so young. I
wanted to go over and shake ‘his
hand or whisper’ some comforting
words into his ear, but I dared not:
for that spectre was glaring at me.
Perhaps that stare meant I; was

The«door was closed and’ silehce
reigned again. Now there were only
four of us.

The wind outside rustled the dry

leaves, for it was autumn. “Hmp,

autumn,” [ thought, “autumn means
the death of things. No, No, I must
not think of things like that.”

I lapsed into a complete state of
senselessness. Upon awakéning, |
saw that there were only two of us
left. I studied my companion's face.
It was haggard and worn as prob-
ably mine was. Deep lines in his
face from fear made him seem like

turned white and his eyes became
dull. He rose slowly and walked out
of the room.

I was left. The many thoughts of
gruesome torture that flooded
through my brain, I know not what
they were. Along with them came
the thoughts of the many happy
days of life—the fun we “used to
have in the old vacant lot, the pranks
we used to play on Halloween, and
the wonderful times I had in high
school. I was almost. forced to smile
when the grim reality I was about
to face suddenly came back to me.

What was that? Footsteps? Yes.
I waited with baited breath. For
the last time the door opened. I]
was ready. Now I know how those
before me felt. My stomach seemed
to curl up and my heart: turn cold
and stop. I arose and walked with
head high and spirits low toward the
door, where that. twisted bit of
humanity waited for me. There I
