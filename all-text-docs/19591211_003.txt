SIDELINES
ON OPORTS

By B. MILLNER

BLOOD-SPLOTCHED Ed Stewart arched the sec-!

ond of two free throws through the cords and a few sec-
onds later the howlingest mob of students seen at a Da-
vidson athletic contest in a long time converged upon
him and pushed big Ed up on their shoulders.

Stewart had scored 16 points and had pulled down
15 rebounds. !t was a good night for the rangy Senior
from Kingsport. Ed Stewart never made All-State
or even All-Conference over in Tennessee. As a matter
of fact, he only played basketball for one year in
high school. But somebody founa out that he could

just about reach the rim of the basket with his elbow,
so Davidson signed him up.

FOR AWHILE it looked like a bad gamble. Stewart
could jump but his shots caron
like cannon balls. Ed kept at it though, and toward the
end of last year he began shooting the ball instead of}
throwing it. Tuesday night against Catawba he was Da-|
vidson’s leading scorer. He shot eight times and only
missed three. He also hit six for eight free throws, in-
cluding the two at the last that put the game on ice.

Joe Markee was the other hero of the Catawba
game. He put the ‘Cats ahead for the first time in the
second half and sank the foul shots that gave them
a three-point lead.

THERE WERE really eight heros: Shinn, who actual-
ly won the game with a monumental jump shot with |
45 seconds left on the clock; Huie, who put them tempo-|
rarily in the lead with a minute left, Bussell, who played

a fine flaor game and got most of his points late in the)
game when they helped most; and Nuckolls, Martin and |
who gave the starters much-needed rest
and proved that the ’Cats are a much deeper team this

year.
Davidson came from behind against a smart, well-

coached team that was favored to win by five points.
They proved that they could run, hustle and perhaps
shoot betier than last year’s squad. Maybe the loss of
Hollingsworth and Mintz, wasn‘t insurmountable aft-
er all.

‘upset hopes smothered as powerful Wake Forest whipped them 90-55.

Davidson played the Demon
Deacons on even terms for the
first 10 minutes of the ball
game but Wake Forest soon
shot ahead and went to the
}dressing room with a 51-24 half-
itime lead.

the last minute of the game to
win 67-62. A long jump shot
by Shinn put the ‘Cats out in
front 63-62 with 30 seconds to
go and Joe Markee added two
foul shots to give Davidson a
three-point spread.

As Catawba tried desperate-
ly to pull the game out, Ed
Stewart was fouled and put the
icing on the cake with two more
free throws. Stewart, who
played an outstanding rebound-
ing game in his first start of
the year, was also high point
man with 16.

The ‘Cats won their second
game of the young season last
Saturday, 84-70, against virtual
ly the same King College team
that upset them last year in
Bristol. Shinn, Bussells and
Markee were high for David
son, with 21, 17 and 17 points!
respectively.
