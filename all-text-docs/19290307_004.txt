Tennessee Club Has
Successful Meeting

Committee Provides Refresh-
ments for Members of Club

Among the most outstanding social
events at the close of the winter sea-
son was the first meeting for the year
of the Tennessee Club. The president,
William Marvin Regen, vulgarly
known as Bill and “Sporty,” of Frank-
lin, Tenn., (Bill says an interurban con-
nects Franklin with its largest suburb,
Nashville), presided at the meeting.

After C. N. Burch reported that he
had carefully kept the terms of the
sentence, passed upon him at the last
meeting, of residing in Memphis for
the rest of his days and the rest of his
nights, the feature of the program was
presented, consisting of an address by
Joseph Gardner. Mr. Gardner first te-
viewed the early history of the col-
onies, leading up to the first. settle-
ments on the Wataugua; he then pro-
ceeded to give a detailed account of
the early deeds of the pioneers; con-
tinued in a thorough discussion of the
Revolutionary days; then dealt with
the early national period of the state;
passing then to a careful relation of
the events of the Civil War, and all
subsequent events. He concluded with
a relation of the lives of all the gov-
ernors of the state and a culogy of
the valorous men of the Volunteer
State.

After the club had joined in singing
the international anthem of the com-
monwealth of the state, “O Tennessee,”
a magnificent pennant and knee-high
loving cup was voted to be given to
the delegation from Bristol, five in
number, for having the most members
present. It was, however, stipulated
that these awards should only be made
in case the treasury justified the ex-
penditure.

The entertainment committee, E. C.
Close, W. G. McGavock, and “R. F, D,”
Miller, arranged to serve sandwiches
for nourishment.

Those present were—oh, yes! they
also had on hand candy, apples, chew-
ing-gum, oranges, Eskimo pies, ba-
nanas, various and sundry cakes, coca-
cola, chocolate milk and all other ar-
ticles sold by
magazines,

COLLEGIATE QUIPS

the State College five swept Duke off
the court and won the Southern con-
ference title Tuesday night. The
State five led at the half and with the
final results announced the title of
Southern Conference Champ was
awarded to N.-C. State. And so on
and so on,

This is done to try to forestall the
State boys in the publication of this
item. The Davidsonian wishes to con-
gratulate State on her vic-
tory and also to rejoice in the fact that
it was two North Carolina teams that
furnished the teams for the finals of
the tournament.

with destructive criticism. Down in

The review of the college literary ef-
fort is not all a “Bed of roses,” what-
ever that may mean, but the review
does not set out to tear to pieces each
and every article that was printed.

Prof. Currie Speaks
To Ministerial Band

Life a Service of Choices Involv-
ing True Valuation

“IT do not wish to aid you in choos-
ing a life’s calling, because you have
already done that, but I do wish to at-
tempt to confirm you in the choice
which you have made,” said Prof. Ar-
chibald Currie, in speaking to the Min-
isterial Band on last Sunday after-
“The thing about which I want

noon.
to speak to you is ‘Values.
Life is a series of choices which in-
volve valuation and we take the most
valuable. We are choosing
roads to follow and there is always
danger lest we choose the wrong one.
Some roads might not lead to the
greatest material gains but those
which carry to intellectual and
spiritual goals are the most valuable.
The question before uf is to choose the
greatest value and to find what that
value is.

When the question to
whether we shall act for the present
life or to equip ourselves for the fu-
ture life, most people choose the pres-
ent life.

Isaiah in the 16th chapter and 14th
verse speaks of the man who made the
error of putting the wrong things first.
This man satisfied his physical wants
first and thought that he was content
but, he was not. His spirit was not
satisfied but he had only the residue
of the tree which he had cut to make
worship. He was only a heathen but
we “would have had more respect for
him had he worshipped his god first.
There are many people who put the
material before the spiritual but they
are never happy. The minister de-
votes the best part of his life to God
and uses what is left to satisfy his
physical needs:
piness lies.
Isaiah called the man who made a
god with the part of, the tree which he
had left over foolish.

DRAKE SPEAKS

Volunteer Band Sends Out Two
_Deputations Sunday

The Volunteer Band met Sunday af-
ternoon in Shearer Hall. Ben Drake
had charge of the meeting, leading the
devotional and giving a talk on
“Church and Missions.” In his talk
Drake brought out four points which
he used to discuss his subject, namely:
Missionary obedience is essential to
the vitality of the Church; Missionary
obedience the antidote to the sel-
fishness of Church and individual; it
quickens the Church with fresh proofs
of the living Christ; it lifts the Church
to her Spiritual best. Around these
points, he built an interesting and in-
spiring talk.

Two deputations were sent out Sun-
day. One gave a program at the Pres-
byterian Church of Statesville, while
the other had charge of the service at
the Presbyterian Church of Cornelius.

Eumanean Literary Society at its
meeting on the 28th of February was

Ramseur Entertains With Saw
at Poplar Tent Church

Two deputations were sent out by
the Davidson ™” on last Sunday;
one was to the Poplar Tent Church
and the other was the usual speaker
which is sent to the Charlotte “Y” each
Sunday.

The group sent to the Poplar Tent
Church held a Christian
meeting that night which proved to
be a great success. During the meet-
ing talks were made by W. R. Hill,
W. H. Bailey, and Robert Turner
which were enjoyed very much by
present. The feature of the
meeting, however, was a number of

several encores were given the mu-

so pleased with the meeting that the
students were cordially invited to re-
turn on the next possible occasion.

Hypnosis Popular
As Fad On Campus

Several Men Prove to Be Suc-
Successful Hypnotizers

With the advent of the second sem-
ester and the study of hypnosis in the
class on abnormal psychology comes
the usual wave of hypnotizers and fake
subjects on the campus. Students of
psychology begin to look for fresh-
men with submissive attitudes whom
they may dominate easily.

During the past week and a half all
willing freshmen have been sought and
tried, and the hard subjects eliminated.
Good subjects are very much in de-
mand at present.

Among those who have been success-
ful in their attempts at hypnotizing
are Frank Hall, Fred Poag, Albert
Halverstadt, John Melton and Ellis E.
Marsh, There are several difficulties
they have to cope with. They have
difficulty in persuading subjects to
submit to trial; in trial and failure;
and in the occasional freshman who
pretends that he “under.” A pe-
culiar complication has also developed
in one of the good subjects who, it is
reported, has promised his girl he will
not submit to hypnotism again.

The Saturday and Sunday night di-
version found in the usual “bull
sion” has changed to large gatherings
to observe the antics of the freshmen.

One of the most interesting phases
of hypnotism is found in the results of
post-hypnotic influences. While the
subject still under the control of
the hypnotizer, he tells him to perfornt
certain after he* has been
awakened, No matter how unusual or
silly the order may be the subject al-
ways finds some excuse to execute it.

his popularity; corporations should be
willing to follow his precedent, out a

Albert Frank, adniutting his rela-

the Fatherland could not place implicit
trust in him. Failing to obtain a copy
of the Franco-Belgian treaty, he.made
one, offering it to his superiors. It
was published in many papers before
its true origin was known. Secret

secrecy and little can be proved if
they choose to change horses in the
middle of the stream. Their activities
are never forgotten.
