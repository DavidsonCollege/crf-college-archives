In appreciation of their never-failing
ability to pull such awful bones that they
keep all members of the upper classes in

|found on any campus anywhere, and
their general contribution to the degre-
| dation of the several branches consti-
|tuting the tree of mental aspirations
| known in the vulgar tongue as Knowl-
ledge this number of the Peanut Parcher
is the recipient of a foul blow of fate by
|having been dedicated to that branch of
{humanity known as the Davidson RAT.

| rodent family).

R. 0. T. C. Makes Plans |

For the Year's Work

Huie Cadet Major—Band to Play at
Football Games and at Speedway

With the largest number of students tak-
ing the R. O. T. C. course since its institution

jat Davidson College, the military department

faces a most promising year, according to
Capt. George H. Weems, who will be at the
head of the department again this year.
Captain Weems is greatly encouraged with
the number of students enrolled in the ad-
vanced course which will insure greater ef-
ficiency in the whole corps. The appoint-
ments for cadet officers have been announced
with L, B, Huie to be cadet major for the
coming year to head the battalion. Huie is
a Senior and has had a great deal of ex-
perience in military work, There will be five
cadet captains, namely, D. G. Wilson, L. L.
Deck, B. U. Ratchford, G. W. Smith, J. E.
Moore, and B, T. Crayton, who will have
charge of the band. All these men have

) merited their “bars” by their hard work.

The teaching staff will be increased one |

over last year, Captains Weems, Dougherty
and Elkins and Lieutenant Beckett composing
the executive staff. Each will have separate
divisions of duty. Captain Weems will be
professor of Military Science and Tactics,

cal officer of Company D. Captain Dough-
erty will have charge of finances and prop-
erty and will be tactical officer of Company
B and instructor of the Freshman. class.
Captain Elkins will be tactical officer of
Company A, have charge of the band and
in addition will be instructor of the Junior
class.
ficer of Company C and instructor of the
Senior class and will also act as adjutant.

The R. O. T. C. course will run along the

‘instructor of the Sophomore class and tacti- |

Lieutenant Beckett will be tactical of- |

same general policies of last year, with only,

a few minor changes. The corps will be re-
quired to equip themselvs with regulation tan
army shoes which will make a much better

| appearance for the battalion. Captain Weems

is anxious for students to consider the shoes |

at the Students’ Store before purchasing oth-
ers as they are the official type and are also
cheaper in price. No credit will be given
men for military work taken in prep or high
schools.

Another change is the remodeling of the
first floor of the armory which took place

this summer under the direction of Captain
Dougherty. The floor has been more conven-
iently arranged. The doors have been en-
larged to prevent crowding. All classes in
R. O. T. C. will be taught on the second
floor of the armory.
