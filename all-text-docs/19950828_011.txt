“You’re a
village
girl now.”

By TRACY PRIVETTE
& SARA SMITH
Guest writers

“You're a village girl now.”
These were the words of Dr.
Jeevanandem, our host in India
and the founder of the Keel
Ottivakkam Grama Sangam, acen-
ter for disabled children. Along
‘with Pin Chang, Tony Yoder, Sara
Smith, and Bonner Scholar coor-
dinator Katherine Cooke, I volun-
teered in India for four weeks this
summer, two of which were spent
with the children in the village of
Keel Ottivakkam. There’s nodoubt
about it: India is strange to West-
erm eyes in almost every aspect
imaginable. During our stay, we
immersed ourselves in village cul-
ture. Far from the Taj Mahal and
the tourist beaches of Goa, Keel
Ottivakkam was reachable only by

bus — and we don’t mean a Grey-:

hound. Because the buses traveled
along roads laden with crater-sized
holes, their shocks were nonexist-
ent. Seats were the prized posses-
sion of those who dove and shoved
the hardest — usually,men. Ev-
eryone else was left to stand in
aisles which were so crowded that
the ticket collector could barely
squeeze through.

In our group of five, the three
women stayed in rooms at the
children’s ‘hostel, while the two
men slept in a thatched-roof mud
hut behind the home of
Jeevanandem’s mother. We were
awakened each morning to roost-
ers screeching, and those of us in
the hostel also heard the sounds of
children yelling, “Auntie, Auntie!”
at the bottom of the stairwell. Be-
fore breakfast, we joined the kids
downstairs for “exercise.” Doing
physical therapy for the polio-
stricken children proved to be ex-

-ercise mainly for us. The most
difficult part, however, was seeing
the pain on their faces as we at-
tempted to strengthen and
straighten their polio-atrophied
legs. One day Sara said to me, “I
have never prayed as desperately
for anything as for these children.”

Our work in the village would
have been much harder if it hadn’t
been for the kids vibrant personali-
ties and eager acceptance of us.
Among other things, they told the
women in our group that our West-
ern clothes were too drab and that
we were not wearing enough jew-
elry. The older girls eagerly placed
bindis between our eyes on our
foreheads. To them, the red dots
increased our beauty immensely.
As village girls (and-boys) we

Doors Open to a New Universe:

_Cofmic Coffee

By TERESA WHITE
Assistant Arts & Living Editor

The sign promoting Cosmic
Coffee has been in the window of
the old antique store on Main Street
for so long this summer that some
were beginning to doubt its actual
arrival. But despite extended de-
lays in construction, the shop is
coming to Davidson.

The earliest predicted open-
ing date is mid-October, and at the
latest early November, according
to owner and cook Nancy McBride
Gray. “The waiting has been ex-
tremely frustrating for me,” she
says. “Trouble with contractors
has set us back. We’ve gone
through two rounds of designing
and bidding and redesigning and
re-bidding. I like to jump into
things, get right on them. I’m
frustrated with the rate of progress
so far, and anxious to open the
doors.”

Gray and her husband own
another Cosmic Coffee in Blow-
ing Rock, NC, but actually opened
their first coffee shop in Charlotte
on North Davidson Street. As the
city and coffee shop expanded,
however, the couple grew tired of
the atmosphere and moved to

Blowing Rock, leaving their daugh- .

ter to run the café.

“Blowing Rock has a quality
of life that is hard to find. There is
a village atmosphere that is rare,”
Gray says. Itis an atmosphere that
she has found again in Davidson.

Gray plans to recreate most
aspects of the Blowing Rock Cos-

mic Coffee here. The menus will
be the same, offering muffins, ba-
gels, desserts, and a light lunch
including soup, salads, and pizza
du jour.

And the coffee, of course—
espresso, café au lait, cappuccino,
and a variety of gourmet blends.
The coffee will be roasted in the
Blowing Rock shop and brought to
the Davidson one. “They say it
roasts better at high altitudes.”

Gray stresses that they make
all the food served. “It’s all fresh;
nothing is bought and served. I’m
concerned about the way Ameri-
cans today eat. I make things light

whenever possible.”

The Davidson Cosmic Coffee
will probably have later hours than
the other one. Gray says, “We are
thinking about 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.
during the week and until mid-
night on the weekends. We’d like
some feedback about that.”

The Blowing Rock shop has
also become a local venue for strug-
gling musicians to play. “We fo-
cus on young artists performing
original music. Cole Coffee, Chuck
Henderson, and David Childers are
some of our favorites. We hope
they’ ll follow us here to play,”’ she
says.

“But,” she adds, “don’t worry
about cover charges. We don’t
believe in cover charges. That’s
too much like a bar.. We’re a
friendly coffee shop.”

Another feature Cosmic Cof-
fee hopes to’ offer is a computer
carrel, so that customers will be
able to e-mail: “I mean, we are
Cosmic, and this is, after all, al-
most-the twenty-first century.”

Gray emphasizes that this is
not going to be “a typical college
dive. We don’t want or like the
dive atmosphere. We want it com-
fortable, approachable. This shop
is for everyone.”

The Summer Stage:
Abbott and Barber bring
community together through theater

By JoHN CopENHAVER
Arts & Living Editor

Throughout the summer Pro-
fessor of Theatre Rupert Barber
and Professor of English Tony
Abbott were rigorously involved
with summer theater at Davidson.
In both cases the professors found
drama in the Davidson community
to be an interesting and rewarding
change from the school year.

Barber directed a production
of Bells Are Ringing, a 50s vintage
hit musical set in New York City
with acast from the Davidson com-
munity and surrounding area.
According to Barber, this group,
officially called the Davidson
Community Players, consisted of
over 100 volunteers doing every-
thing from ushering to acting. “To
see that many people involved in
some aspect of theater is exciting,”
Barber said as he reflected back on

the summer. Although Davidson
Community Players is considered
an amateur company, it draws
many talented individuals from the
surrounding area as well as from
the Davidson faculty.

- This group of players origi-
nally grew out of female actors
that came from the community to
act with the male students when
Davidson was still single sex. Once
the college started accepting
women students, there was no
longer a need to bring women in
from the community. These fe-
male actors desired an outlet for
their creative energy. Thus the
Davidson Community Players was
born.

Barber has been witness to the
growth of this community organi-
zation in the past years and wishes
to see it continue to grow in the
future.

Abbott had a different experi-

ence directing a new play called
The Moving of Lilla Barton by
John MacNicholas, Playwright-in-
Residence at the University of
South Carolina in Columbia.
MacNicholas, who grew up in
Statesville, wrote this play with
great appeal to small southern com-
munities such as Davidson. The
play is about an Episcopal
minister’s widow who struggles to
come to terms with her grief over
her husband’s death. This struggle
centers around her refusal to leave
her home, the rectory, as a way of
preserving her identity and dig-
nity.

Abbott says, “We thought the
idea of doing a new play by a
regional playwright was wonder-
ful” and a way of bringing a new
play to the attention of the public.
On opening night MacNicholas,
Abbott, and the cast held open dis-
cussion with the audience ‘which

proved to be a stimulating experi-
ence in itself. “I think it’s a way of
allowing the audience to partici-
pate not only in seeing the play but
also in talking and getting involved
in the issues that the play raised,”
Abbott commented. It is a suc-
cessful way for the actors to get
important feedback from the com-
munity and a way for the audience
to expresses their thoughts on the
play. Having an open discussion is
a way to underline “community”
in “community theater.”

In both cases these professor-
directors were successful in their
summer endeavors.. Community
theater in Davidson is prove of
what can be accomplished by a
spirited group of people. This vi-
vacity and strength of theater is a
trait that carries over from the
school year into the community
with rewarding and exciting re-
sults.
