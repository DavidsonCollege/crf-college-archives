Homecoming weekend lassoes students

By BILL HOLLADAY
Staff Writer

Homecoming at Davidson tradi-
tionally includes a concert, a dance,
and Patterson Court dances to sup-
plement the big game. This year; the
Union Board decided to expand the
format, and the result promises to
offer something for everyone.

“There will be more going on this
weekend than on any in my four years
at Davidson,’’ commented Union
Publicity Committee Co-Chairman
Patti Smisson.

Headlining the.events will be the
Stebbing Royal European Circus, a
‘real’ circus which traces its history
back to the roving bands of entertain-
ers in the seventeenth century.

A family operation for centuries,
the present group of Stebbings has
toured the U.S. many times and has
made a total of nine command per-
formances before the Royal Family of
England.

The Stebbings are proud of their
record and their show: each of their
twenty acts hails from a circus family
which dates back at least a hundred
years and has the credentials to prove
it.

As owner Bill Stebbing told a
Richmond reporter, ‘‘With a small
group and one ring, everything has
got to be good, because there are no
distractions for the audience.”

“It’s time the American people got
to see a real circus,’’ he added, ‘‘not
the burlesque and night club-type
acts of the big circuses here.’’ The
group will set up here Friday, with

performances at 4:30 and 7:30 pm.
This weekend’s concert will teature

Livingston Taylor and the Mike
Greene Band. ‘‘Livingston Taylor has
lived too long in the shadow of his
brother James,’’ Smisson noted. ‘It’s
time he got some recognition of his
own as a good folk musician.”
Although not as well-known, the
Mike Greene Band should prove just

as entertaining. Playing assorted:

keyboards, saxes, and flutes, Mike
Greene has acquired a devoted follow-
ing in his native Atlanta with his
combination of jazz and rock.

‘‘We were lucky to get both acts
here on the same night,’’ said a
Concert Committee spokesman,
“That’s usually a big problem. I think
Livingston Taylor will go over well,
and the students who haven’t heard
Mike Greene we hope will be pleasant-
ly surprised.”’

In keeping with the Western theme
of Homecoming ’76, the Union Board
has really done some brainstorming.
The 900 Room will be turned into an
1850’s saloon, complete with can-can
girls, song-and-dance routines, a
chorus line, and more.

JAZZ ARTIST MIKE GREENE and band will
share program' with Livingston Taylor.

tainment for the big weekend.

‘We plan to have a show made of
up volunteer freshmen, members of
the women’s chorus, and anyone else
who wants to participate,’’ said
Smisson. “There will be a banjo and
fiddle group, a medicine man, and
with various sundry Indians raiding
the place, it should be a lot of fun.”’

Wednesday and Thursday, and 8:30
pm Friday night.

A Homecoming sheriff will be
elected Thursday, and pinned in the
saloon between shows Thursday
night. His duties, in the words of
Board member Bruce Hoster, will
consist mainly of ‘‘being a figurehead
and serving warrants on people for a
small fee (to be donated to the
Huntersville Boys’ Home), and gen-
erally usurping any power he has.’’

Saturday morning at 10 am expert
Dr. Julian Pleasants ’60 will teach a
capsule course on the Old West,
complete with guns and costumes.
Smisson emphasized that this is not
only for alumni, but will be ‘‘very
entertaining and of great interest to
students, too.”’

In addition to all this there will be a
John Wayne Western, two Buster
Keaton films, a big dance (free) in the
Banquet Hall after the concert with
““Showcase’’, cartoons, student per-
formers in Belk Quad, and, of course,
the parties on Patterson Court. Check
the events calendar for details.

Bonnie Koloc : Close-Up Epic

You’re probably asking yourself
who in the world Bonnig Koloc is; if
you had lived in the Mid-West in the
late ’60’s, you might know. In
Chicago at the turn of the decade she .
had somewhat of a cult, and she
received several fine reviews in Chic-
ago newspapers. She has a couple of
previous albums on obscure labels,
but this is her first attempt on a
major label.

Koloc has a pleasant voice, some-
times too pleasant, which is sort of a
cross between Joan Bagz and Judy
Collins. The album is composed
mainly of songs which could be class-
ified as ‘‘easy listening’, a style
which she seems to be mpst comfort-
able singing style. Howeter, she does
have several up-tempo cuts, including
a 1951 Hank Snow song entitled ‘‘The
Rhumba Boogie’’, which may have
potential AM airplay 4 it sounds
amazingly like ‘‘The Bodgie Woogie
Bugle Boy of Company 3.’’. If you’re
looking for an easy listet ing album,
definitely buy this.
