The Davidsonian

Wiidcats chan

by CHARLES ERWIN
Assistant Features Editor

Davidson College has taken more
liberties with the form and figure of

the southern wildcat than modern art
has taken with the human body.

There are red wildcats, yellow
wildcats, wildcats wearing sweaters
and even some wildcats with green,
gray and cream spots.

The leaning red wildcat, which is
found on student store bags and
several decals, is perpetually intro-

ducing itself by extending its black %

tophat. Despite this, it often appears
with the caption ‘‘“A Davidson Man
needs no introduction.”

As student store manager Peter
Nicholls explained, however, most of
the wildcats which appear on com-
mercial items such as decals, tee-
shirts, and patches are not designed
by the college at all. >

The baseball-capped wildcat found
on the laundry’s paper coat covers
looks remarkably as if it had been
washed by the laundry itself. It is
wrinkled, burned, and blurred.

A few of these quasi-felines, like the
tigers on the laundry bags and the
screaming panther in the gym, no
longer pretend to bear any relation to
their forest-roaming counterpart.

Some of the cats are ironically
symbolic of the situations in which
they are found.

The ARA snack bar wildcat has
cheeks which are puffed out like a
chipmunk’s mouth when carrying a

load ot nuts. If you can’t eat the food,
you've got to find something to do
with it.

Of all these dozen wildcat figures
only two on the whole campus bear
any resemblance to the real animal.

The first is the stuffed wildcat in
the lobby of the gym. Despite missing
ear tufts, worn teeth, and a bedrag-
gled hide, this cat. does bear some
resemblance to what it looked like,
pre-bullet.

The best representation is the
Ralph McDonald painting which is
presently being pawned off on the
alumni at $37 a print. In spite of the
stiff look (it looks more like a stuffed
animal than the stuffed cat) it is
accurate, according to photographs of
the real beast.

The paper mache wildcat head used
by the cheerleaders has sharply
crossed eyes. No wonder the basket-
ball team has trouble seeing just
where to throw the ball.

ihe wildcat has only served as
Davidson’s mascot for the last 60
years. Up until then the athletic
teams were known as the “Presbyte-
rians’’ or the ‘Red and Blacks.”’

But when in November 1917, the

“Fhe Student rip-off

By BETH BAIRD

It’s early morning, you have just
finished that 12-page paper due
tomorrow at 8 am, and you’re
starving. You grab your roommatés
car keys, get some money, and then
hop over to 7-11 for a little snack that
ends up costing you more than a meal
at Slug’s Tower. Does this sound
familiar? Well if this has ever hap-
pened to you, here are some facts that
you might be interested in.

First of all, say you want a frozen

elob. At Cashions, it would cost
$3.04; at Harris Teeter it would be
$3.10; and at 7-11 you would spend
about a dollar more, a big $4.04.

This survey, taken on January 31,
showed that on the average, the
prices at Cashions and Harris Teeter
were comparable. However, the prices
at 7-11 showed a substantial markup,
which can only be compengated by
their being open 24 hours.

A comparison of items priced is also
listed, so next time you think about
that late food run, you might think

THE DAVIDSON WILDCAT
shows its face in a variety of
different ways.

(Hunter Jennings)
startling upset over Auburn, the
Atlanta Constitution ran a banner
headline on the top of page 1; which
read “Davidson Wildcats Upset the
Dope by outplaying and beating
Auburn.”’

The association has stuck ever
since. Indeed, the choice of the
wildcat has turned out to be entirely
appropriate, in scholarly as well as in
athletic pursuits.

Just as Davidson students are
loath to participate in classroom
discussions unless they fear their
grades might suffer, “‘wildcats are at
all times shy and exceedingly cauti-
ous about showing themselves’’. . .,

as stated in Stone and Cram’s 1902
edition of American Animals.

There is also a marked similarity in
this animal’s hunting habits and
students’ methods of researching
term papers. ‘‘Lacking skill at fol-
lowing a trail, and the speed and
tireless perseverance which makes
foxes and weasels such successful
hunters, they catch most of their
game by lying hidden in ambush and
springing out suddenly on whatever
small game comes within reach. . .”
