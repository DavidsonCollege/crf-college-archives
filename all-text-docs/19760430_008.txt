Active Ada Jenkins offers variety

Staff Writer

Desegregation closed the
doors of Davidson’s black
elementary school in 1966. The
doors of the Ada Jenkins
School remained closed until

the Fall of 1974, when the SUE

schoolhouse was converted
into the Davidson Community
Center.

Today the Center operates
in relative obscurity across the
railroad tracks. Very few stu-
dents know of the Center,
much less what it does. Des-
pite the shroud of obscurity,
the Center offers a wide range
of opportunities, and provides
many useful services.

The revenue sharing pro-
gram of the Federal Govern-
ment provides the funds for
running the Center. Mecklen-
burg County employs four
full-time workers at the Cen-
ter. Kathy Harp is the director
of Ada Jenkins, and she is
responsible for the organiza-
tion and administration of the
Center.

Sports fan entices us
with baseball nostalgia

and programs are offered at
Ada Jenkins, and the degree
of participation in the program
varies also. The programs and

services range trom food

stamp clinics and legal aid to
recreation programs and hot
meals for the elderly.
According to Harp the hot
meals program is one of the
most successful programs at

A wide variety of serves

the Center.

Originally hot lunches were
provided three times a week
for the elderly, but participa-
tion was so great that lunches
are served five days a week
now. :

Sixty to eighty lunches are
served at the Center, and
another 40 are delivered to the
housebound. There is now

gram, and Harp feels the

popularity is because “the old

people just don’t want to eat
one.”

Recreational programs are
provided year round at the
Center. Each day after school
about 40 children take part in
the program. The evening and
night is reserved for teen aged
and adult recreation. Billy
Warren and Dora Barrenger

direct the recreation activities.

Homemaking and handi-
craft skills are taught in the
evening at the Center. Slight
fees are charged, to those
interested in improving their
sewing, upholstery, and cera-
mic skills. These practical
skills classes are popular with

_ the townspeople.

Another of the more suc-
cessful programs which uses
the Community Center is the
Schoolhouse of the Arts.

Each week people of all ages
are taught acting, drama, and
art under the tutelage of
Elizabeth Bradford and Mrs.
Connie Welsh. Presently the
registration in this program
stands at 171 persons.

Kathy Harp feels that the
Center has been successful
thus far. The major problems
facing the Center according to
Harpe are reparis and upkeep,
and planning so that everyone
can use the facilities.

At this time the Center is
cramped for space, and that is
a good sign for it means there
is an active participation in
the programs offered.

Every year at this time (or even
earlier) I start to get anxious to see
baseball being played. It is an urge I
share with countless others, but each
of us has individual affinities con-
necting the sport to our own lives. I
am not only speaking of loyalty to a
favorite team, but also a basic
enjoyment of the game itself.

I don’t think I am relaying start-
ling information when I say that
sports in the past ten years have
become a deluge of intolerant replay,
expansion of existing leauges, salary
disputes and other charactéristics
which are either boring or destructive
to the basic idea of spectator: sports as
a diversion and not as a satellite
transmitted mega-event.

Although I follow all sports to some
extent, in this video age my favorite
remains baseball. This is a bit ironic
because baseball is the least gripping
of the major sports seen on television.
I do not expect to convert any of you
into baseball fanatics, but I do hope
to entice you to go to a big league
park, or to a Davidson game, or even
to the lawn in front of Belk with a ball
and glove im your hands.

The greatest thing about the game
for me in its pace: it is the only major
spert with no time limit. The basic
field layout has not changed in almost
one hundred years.”

The distance of ninety feet between
the bases lends itself exactly to infield
putouts, stealing bases, and outfield
throws to nail runners. A distance of
sixty and one half feet separate the
pitcher from the batter giving a hitter

roughly three-fifths of a second to.

decide whether it will be a strike or
not.

I will not try to convince anyone
that all baseball games are inter-
esting, but to me the fact that two
teams can play twice and have a 15-1

game and then a 3-2 game is an
essential part of its charm. The game
is only dull when one doesn’t realize
all the possibilities.

Baseball has more strategy in-
volved in every offensive and defen-
sive play or alignment then any sport.
The players may seem languid on the
field, but in an instant the ball could
be hit at any one of them. In a tight
game with men on base the tension in
a ballpark can be numbing, with
every pitch assuming the importance
of a clutch basketball free throw.

When watching a good game, I find
it easy to forget what level of play I’m
observing. It could be the Reds and
Braves. The Charlotte Orioles and the
Lookouts of Chattanooga or the
Wildcats and Richmond: The es-
sentials of the game are the same. The
possibilities are the same.

I was one of those baseball brats
who knew basic statistics for every
team and player. The only reason I
was interested in learning long divi-
sion was so that I could keep up with
Mickey Mantle’s batting average
daily. Now I appreciate a good
boxscore of a game from a newspaper
because you can reconstruct an entire
game from it. This can’t be done with
any other sport.

I used to spend all of my summers
in the mountains with my grand-
parents. Paps is a great fan and we
used to pitch and hit flies three times
a day. He was a fine player in his day
and his memories were of Ty Cobb,
Sheeless Joe Jackson, Christy
Mathewson and Babe Ruth. I used to
drill him for hours about these great
players and compare them in my mind
to my heroes.

Kids who follew other sports may
ee
mannerism from a star, but as
baseball ebserver I made it is
business to amalgamate my fantasies.
I could make a basket catch like
Willie Mays, roll my cap like Mantle,

run with my elbows up like Aaron,
and spit like Nellie Fox.

I hope you will avail yourself of the
pleasures of a big league game this
summer. The Orioles are a great way
to see the game up close, and our own
Wildcats have had some fine games
this year as well.

If you want to know the statistics
of literally every player and team that
has been associated with pre ball, get
the Baseball Encyclopedia. Other
good books are The Summer Game by
Roger Angell, The Story of Their
Times by Lawrence Ritter, and The

Boys of Summer by Roger Kahn.

A few weeks ago I watched
Davidson beat Richmond in‘a well
played game. It was a great day spent
on the right field bank with friends
and beer and idle conversation. The
players were gone and the field had
been dragged and watered, and I was
ready to leave when Palmer Muench
and his son reappeared for some
batting practice. It was incredably
nice sipping, talking and hearing the
crack of that distant bat. It’s one of
those things one must experience and
I hope you will.

Bazbo sat contemplating the
