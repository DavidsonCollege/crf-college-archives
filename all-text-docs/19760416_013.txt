Runners

Three school records and a
number of strong perform-
ances boosted the Davidson
trackmen to a fifth-place finish
in the 17th Annual Davidson
Relays here Saturday, several
places higher than expected.

In the women’s division of
that same contest, the small
Wildcat women’s team over-
came a team from Lynchburg
and individuals from Duke
and Lenoir-Rhyne te take first
place.

The largest Relays yet, the
meet was won by the team
from Carson-Newman, who
ended up way ahead of the
other 20 teams competing.
Also, with one of the strongest
fields yet, the meet saw twelve
new Relays records set.

Leading the Davidson
school records was Jarry Tay-
lor’s hammer throw of
142’4'%"’, which also took first
in that event. Carl McPhail’s
third-place time of :53.8 in the
440 yard intermediate hurdles
was the second school record,
eclipsing the old mark by 1.1
seconds. John Stanfield was
the final Wildcat record-set-
ter, his leap of 6’8” bettering
his previous record of 6’6’’;
however, even though he and
David Ware from West Geor-
gia both jumped 6’8”’ and no
higher, Stanfield lost first
place by total missed jumps.

Other standout Davidson
performances were John Lew-
is’ second place in the pole
vault, Doug Horn’s second in
the steeplechase, Coty Pinck-
ney’s fourth in the six-mile,
and Jeff Diller’s fourth in the
hammer.

Some of the more outstand-
ing Relays records set were
Appalachian’s Louis Blunt’s
time of 29:09.7 in the six-mile,
the Citadel’s Brian Ruff’s
javelin throw of 225’7’’, and

prises in the meet came when
Georgia State’s Robbie Short,
Relays record holder in the
high hurdles, false-started,

and when High Point’s Pearlee

Shaw edged ASU’s Inky Clary
in the intermediate hurdles.

In the women’s events, the

Davidson team was led by four
first place performances: Nan-
cy Brown’s 5:53.9 mile-run,
Beth Tanner’s 14’71%”’ long
jump, Nora McNiell’s :13.1
100 yard dash, and the 880
yard relay victory of McNiell,
Tanner, Brenda Boyle, and
Becca Stimson.

Track coach Sterling Martin
was very pleased with his
team’s performance in the
meet: ‘‘I had expected to
finish anywhere from seventh
to tenth,’’ he said; ‘‘All the

performance.

guys really came through.”
Martin also expressed plea-
sure with the way the meet
turned out. “‘I really want to
thank all of the students,
faculty and staff who helped
us; without them the meet
never would have gone ‘so
smoothly,’’ he said. Martin

added that he also wanted to
“thank the Wildcat Club for

‘their help in renting equip-

ment.’’

The meet was run with the
aid of a photo-finish electronic
timer rented from Duke Univ-
ersity. According to Martin,
‘‘the Accu-Track helped us

considerably in taking times
and judging finishes; although
we did have a bit of trouble
with it at first.”

The Wildcats’ next meet
will be this Thursday when
they travel to Boone for a
dual-meet with Appalachian
State.
