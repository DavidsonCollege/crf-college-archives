Sports
All That

By JIM HAMILTON

As I sit down. to write this column, I can still hear
the sound of the newspaper called the DAVIDSONIAN
crackling between my teeth as I ate the words of my last

article. And ringing in my ears and dancing before my|¥#

eyes like a mystic taunter out of the past, I perceive) i

the words “30-15 in favor of Davidson” — the words of
my first-and last prediction.

A defeat is a hard thing to analyze. You can’t put| (im

your finger on any specific mistake or. weakness. It’s a

mixture of things that combine to produce the final |}

outcome.

Last Friday it was an hetrogenious, but a fatal mix-| am

They all added up — several intercepted passes,
booming punts that kept the Cats back against the
wall, a defense that made the ends easy to circls,
a dropped pass in the end zone, poor pass defense
in the flats, a hard running opponent named Gilder-
sleeve, a team not too used to their new offense
never before tested under pressure, an opponent
touchdown in the closing minutes of the first half —
it all adds up.

But before we shrug our shoulders, shake our heads,

- and slip into the apathy or disgust so many football

fans are guilty of after their team has been upset, par-

* ticularily in the first game of the season, let’s think a

moment.

Only one game has been played this season. And
just because our team had one of those nights, it’s no
reason to forget them.

There's a heck of a lot of potential on this team
perhaps as much as any in the history of Davidson.
They just need a little time to adjust to this new
style of ball; and when they do — watch out.

There are two weeks between the Catawba and the
Citadel game, plenty of time to correct the mistakes,
and plenty of time to brood over the wounds inflicted
by Catawba that will make the Cats a team with a pur-
pose when they take the field next Saturday in Charles-
ton.

David Gilmour seems to have upheld the athletic
honor of the freshmen class by handily winning
the cake race last Monday afternoon. Dave covered the
1.8 mile course in 9:45.7, a new record.

But what I want to know is what about the rest of
the class. It seems around 50% flunked the freshman
physical exam.

Maybe their athletic ability is confined to throw-
ing buckets of water.

Anyway, it appears that the sophomores will have
a pretty easy time of it in the frosh-sophomore field day,
if the physical test proves anything.

Well, freshmen, does it?

The departure of coaches George Thompson and Ernie Wiggins along with in-
creased athletic activity has caused the appearance of several new faces in the vicini-
ty of Johnston Gymnasium. These faces belong to Joe Hunt, George Tucker, and Jim
Walthall, who have been added to the Davidson coaching staff.

JOE HUNT

A graduate of Appalachian
College in 1950, Joe Hunt took
over the job of coaching base-
ball and basketball at North
High. Uncle Sam_ interrupted
his work there for two years,
but Joe returned as soon as his
service was completed and has
produced more than a few win-
ning athletic teams for the
North Mecklenburg school.

Hunt will serve as a
sistent basketball coach
here this year, as well as
coach of the freshman
hardwood team. In addition
to his capacity as o basket-
ball coach, Joe will teach
three Physical Education
classes and help with the
intramural sports.

He is presently living in
Huntersville with his wife and
six months old baby and hag
been working on his master’s
degree at Appalachian during

Jim Walthall, a graduate and

ginia University. is presently !

Foreign Students

Coach J. W. McCutchan
opened soccer practice last

Monday in preparation for the
first game against Pheiffer on
October 7.

Pfeiffer is fielding a team
this year that should be vastly
superior to its contingent of last
year. Last year’s Davidson team
won handily in two contests.

Pfeiffer has dropped football,
however, and is making soccer
its major fall sport. This fact
along with the fact that they
will have much more experi-
ence may make them hard to
handle.

FOREIGN PROSPECTS

Coach J. W. McCutchan
seems to be well pleased with
the progress made by his
charges thus far. He showed
special delight with three new

foreign prospects, and said
that these men, Bergsmer,
Schoning, and Lanier, should

help a lot. These new faces add-
ed to a team that lost only two
lettermen by graduation points
to a good showing against all
their opponents.

Coach McCutchan declined to
give a probable starting line-up
saying that it is too early to;
tell. Starting positions on the
team are still hotly contested.

However, McCutchan feels
that regardless of the starting
line-up the Cats will feel the
most powerful squad in the
teams brief history at’ David-
son. He seems to be enjoying
the role of the fortunate coach
who has two capable men at
every position.

Upstart Catawba Stuns

Wildcats, 22-15

Tired Davidson Lags

By “B” MILLNER
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Last Friday night ‘1e hustling Catawba College
Indians upset Davidson 22-17 for their first win over a
Southern Conference team.

Led by racehorse halfbacks
Larry Gildersleeve and Sam
Morrow, the Indians turned the
Wildcat ends with relative ease,
steering clear of the ponderous
Davidson line. Morrow topped
off a 65 yard drive with an
eight yard burst to put
Catawba ahead 6-0 in the ini-
tial period.

The ‘Cats took over and
moved 70 yards in nine plays,
Paul Barbee pitching to soph
end Danny House for 45. A
Charlie Benson to Craig Wall
pass play went for the score,
and Bruce Usher converted.

OFFENSE WORKS

It appeared as if Coach Bill
Dole’s vaunted “pro” offense
was bewildering the Indians as
Barbee raced eight yards for
the second 'Cat score early in
the second period. Usher again
converted to put Davidson out
in front 14-6.

The Indians failed to move

Freshmen Highlight
Harrier Practice

“The team has looked very
good in practice. We have a
much better balanced team than
last year, but the first meet will
reveal how good we are,” com-
mented Coach Heath. Whittle
concerning the Davidson Cross-
Country Team.

Whittle has been surprised
and very pleased with the
Freshman team. “All of them
are really terrific.” The Fresh-
man squad is composed of
Floyd Walters, R. P. Shaffner,
Al Cowan, B. R. Page, David
Gilmour, H. M. Jones, Larry
Kinney, and Mack Brownlee.

The Coach does not think
the team will be complete-
ly ready for the first meet.

ered a fumble and Davidson
plowed down to the three where
the stubborn Catawba line
threw up a stone wall. Fresb-
man Bruce Usher then angled
his third successful placement
over the crossbar for a field
goal to complete Davidson's
scoring at 17-6.

Catawba took the following
kickoff and blasted 60 yards on
the ground to score, also run-
ning for a two point conversion
which made the score 17-14. The
Indian momentum continued in
the second half as Jim Worth-
Jington put them ahead on a
four yard TD dash. Gildersleeve
passed to Ray Oxendine for two
extra. points and a 22-17 lead.

From there on out it was des-
peration vs. conservatism as Da-
vidson repeatedly fizzled and
Catawba kept them at bay with
booming punts. Finally the end
eame late in the fourth quart-
er when Benson lobbed a pass
right into the hands of the Ca-
tawba safety man.

The question “what hap-
pened?” to the Wildcats’
much publicized razzle-daz-
ale offense is a ticklish one,
but Dole makes no bones
about it.

“Davidson died in the third
quarter. An athlete who is phy-
sically exhausted can’t do a
good mental job either.” He
went on to say that lack of
sleep during Rush Week was a
serious factor in the loss and
that, in view of recent publicity,
there had been a feeling of ov-
jer confidence present.

When asked if he would con-
{tinue the pro-style offense Dole.
replied “very definitely.” He
Said that ‘there had been no
de-emphasis of defense, that in
fact, defense had been stressed
more than ever before.
