The contest, sponsored by
area Chambers of Commerce
and the North Carolina Na-
tional Bank, cited Davidson's
P.A.D.A. for work done in
housing improvemert and
beautification.

The Davidson chapter was ;

awarded a prize of $50 and
will compete with com.
munity groups all over the

state in final judging on
November 11.

The P.A.D.A., formed in
the fall of 1967, is a com-

munity action group with
some sixteen members head-
ed by Mrs. Mildred: Lowery.
The group is ‘aided by the
County Agricultural Agent
and by D. B. Waymer, com-
munity action representative
of the Office of Economic
Opportunity.

Although = all = —P.A.D.A.
members are Negroes, Mrs.
Lowery emphasized that the
organization is open to all
interested in making David
son a better community.

In addition to conducting a
cleanup campaign and up
grading housing in Davidson.
the P.A.D.A. works to find
jobs for unemployed work-
ers and youth. The group has
also petitioned the town gov-

Campus Radio Station Aims

Toward January Opening,

Needs Funds For License

The campus radio station
will be operating by January
if two roadblocks are re-
moved, its student director
said this week.

Money is the major obst-
acle, according to Ed Dobbs.

He said he had applied for
$10,000 from the Duke En-
dowment and Richardson
Foundations to‘ finance the
station.

In late November, when
the money is received from
the foundation with the high-
est offer, it will be added to
the $1,000 the Union gave
the station project last year.

If a foundation falls to

Dobbs hopes to get some
money from the Student Ac-
tivities Fee and organize a
fund drive similar to that
conducted by the YMCA.

The Federal Communica-
tions Commission cannot act
on Davidson's application for
a license until the school has
fulfilled three requirements:

. have an engineer, a suitable
broadcast booth, and proper
financing, according to
Dobbs.

The first two have already
been met and, when the
money is obtained, Davidson
will probably be permitted
to set up a 10 watt station
with the call letters WDAV-
FM and a range of seven
miles.

The programming will be

The station may have a

the new station the necessary
equipment, Dobbs said.

hol taxes and liquor by-the-
drink.

_ In the commissioners race
the Republicans seem to have
the better of it. The two big
issues are consolidation of
the county and city .govern.
ment and the schools.

In the school issue, the De-
mocrats are charging that
the Republican board, head-
ed by Davidson chemistry
Professor James G. Martin,
has not done enough in the
way of raising teachers’
salaries, They want to use
the sales tax in Mecklen
burg County to supplement
the state wages.

Martin counters that the
state will. in all probability,
raise teachers _ salaries.
Therefore. there is no need
to further supplement sala-
ries with more than two
percent of the sales tax rev-
enue.

However, the Democrats
are saying that Martin's
board has cut local supple-
ments of salaries every time
the state has raised teachers
pay. Thus, salaries have re
mained at more or less the
same level.

Martin can show that the
present board has not been
completely insensitive to ed
ucational needs. In the years
of Republican rule, the in-
erease in the school budget
has been three times that of
the previous Democratic
board's increases.

‘We cannot give the Board
of Education everything it
asks for,’’ Martin said. ‘‘We
have to-have. certain priori-
ties as to what, parts of the
budget are most important.”
The Democrats are going to
have to show that the priori
ties have been misplaced.

A minor issue in this elec
tion is the voting machines.
After years of Democratic
debate, Martin's board final
ly decided on and purchased
voling machines.

The machines were not. the
ones recommended by the
Board of Elections, however.
and complications. with them
shave forced the use of paper
ballots in several precincts
in the county.

Democratic Precinct Chair
man Mrs. Norman Johnson
expressed concern that many
voters would cast their votes
for the presidential election
and then fail to vote in the
state elections, not realizing
that they have to pull another
lever to vote a straight ticket
in the state elections.

Other than these issues,
the Democrats are going to
be hard pressed to overcome
the Republican board. The
board has devéloped a

county-wide water and sew-
age policy, cooperated with
the Charlotte City Council to
the extent that the all.De-
mocratic Council has applied
to the Bureau of Housing and
Urban Development to re-
cognize Mecklenburg as a
model of city county  co-
operation, and implemented
a county zoning ordinance in
two-thirds of the county.

‘In the judges race, the 26th
Judicial Bar Association has
endorsed the Democratic
slate of candidates. Aside
from this endorsement,
voters will have to cast their
ballots on the basis of exper-
jence in judicial matters.

Censure

Of Code
Defeated

By CHARLES KNIGHTON
Staff Writer

The Presbytery of Concord
last week voted down a mo-
tion to censure Davidson
College for passing the Code
of Responsibility.

At a meeting of the presby-
tery Oct. 22. a motion was
made to censure the college
for its action concerning
drinking on campus.

According to Dr. Samuel
D. Maloney, Davidson relig-
ion professor who was pre
sent at the meeting, the mo-
tion was defeated by a voice
vote of about 45-15.

Several Davidson trustees
and Maloney spoke in defense
of the college's new rules,

A letter from Dean of Stu-
denis Richard C. Burts Jr.
addressed to-‘“‘friends of
Davidson College’’ concern-
ing the action of the trustees,
was read in order to put
the action in its proper con
text.” said the Rev. Scott
Woodmansee. college chap-
lain. :

At the meeting trustees
who had voted against the
CRAP report defended its:
passage by other trustees.

Because the motion was de-
feated, it was not recorded
in the official report of the
presbytery.

Presbyteries are the gov-
erning bodies of the Presby-
terian Church immediately
above the local] churches. The
presbyteries of North Caro-
lina and Florida elect three.
fourths of Davidson’s Board
of Trustees.

The Presbytery of Concord
is part of the Presbyterian
Church. U.S., with which

ed.
