their uncomfortable relationship
with him. °

One former tenant stated,
“Though the house was nice and
the location was convenient, Ihave
nothing good to say about our rela-
tionship.” Tenants recounted times
when Sadler would enter their
houses unexpectedly, even though
they asked him to announce when

‘he planned to show up.

One tenant recalls, “I was on
edge all the time because we were
afraid he was going to show up
unexpectedly. He never announced
when he was coming.” One former
tenant remembered Sadler letting
himself into their rented house early
inthe morning to complain about a
car parked on the lawn the day
before. :

Residents complain that they
were always on edge not only be-
cause Sadler would enter unex-
pectedly but because he com-
plained about things that renters

troublesome news to the Council.

PCC President Steve Shames
looked to Council members for
possible explanations to the outra-
geous expenditure. Says Shames,
“We can’t continue at this rate.” If
this expenditure remains constant
throughout the year, wristband
costs will consume nearly one-third
of PCC’s risk management bud-
get.

, PCC budget barrels toward financial ruin

Many Council members said
that the wristbands are wasted by
partygoers who finish the night
having used two or three wrist-
bands.

On First Night Down alone,
almost 1,500 wristbands were dis-
tributed on the Court.

Shames doubted there were

the 1,500 people on the Court in
one night.

Shames explains that indi-
viduals attending Court parties
must take. responsibility by wear-
ing their wristbands throughout the
night if the PCC is to remain
within its budget. Houses on the
Court must also take responsibil-
ity through careful distribution of
the wristbands.

Although individual respon-
sibility might alleviate the amount

of money spent on wristbands, the
Council continues to seek-an an-
swer to the problem and is “look-
ing at different things to do,” says
Shames. Currently. the Council is
searching for better prices at which
to purchase the wristbands.

The discussion over the cost
of the wristbands will continue this

Sunday in hopes of an affordable
solution.
