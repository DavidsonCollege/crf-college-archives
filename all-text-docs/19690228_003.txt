Three years ago the Stu.
dent Tutorial Education Pro-
gram was born at Davidson.
From the plans laid by three
Davidson students. Mike Nor-
tis, Marvin Sparrow, and
Jordie Lang. the program

has grown to include some-

120 Davidson students and
tutees.

The tutees, about three.
fourths Negroes, are in the
fourth, fifth, and sixth grades
in the Davidson area.
Each is paired with a parti-
cipating Davidson student
who tries to help him wtih-
his work and get to know
him well.

The primary goal of the
futor-tutee relationship Is

Symposium Stresses Cause
Of Intellectual Involvement

By MARK HODGES
Staff Writer

Stimulus and the Great Is-
sues Symposium are the
YMCA’s contributions to
campus intellectual life.

The purpose of the annual
symposium, to be held this
year on March 24-25, is to
present severa] guest speak-
ers,"each an expert on a
particular question of broad
student interest.

And Stimulus, a student-
faculty project that lasts all
year, tries to get to the heart
of vital discussion topics.

The Great Issues Sympos-
ium. is an innovation in the
extra-curricular program of
the college. The idea behind
the program, according to
Chairman Ken Crews, is to
bring to Davidson ‘‘the type
of person who serves as an
outside the-classroom exper-
ience.”

This year’s speakers, for
Instance, are a palr of poll-
ficians, and Crews said,
“We hope they will excite
some interest in govern-
ment and governmental

problems.”

This year's subject is the
direction of the American
political parties. and the
speakers are to be John J.
Gilligan and Rep. Donald
Riegle, R-Mich.

Gilligan served as a Demo-
cratic representative to Con
gress from Ohio from 1964
to 1966 and was an unsuc
cessful candidate for the Sen
ate in 1968. In his senatorial
canipaign he stressed the
probicms of the urban crisis
and argued that the United
States must develop new for.
cign policies relevant to “to.
day's realities.”

A liberal, he is considered
by many the leader of the
Democratic party in Ohio.

Riegle, 31, is the young-
est member of Congress
ever to serve on the power-
ful House Appropriations
Committee.

He Is one of five young
Congressmen spotiighted in
Newsweek e6 pelitical

“comers” in the 1970’s and
he was selected as one
10 outstanding young men
in the U. S. in 1968.

A Republican, he hes
been a prominent critic of
the United State’s conduct
of the Vietnam wer.

Gilligan and Riegle will
speak in Love Auditorium on
March 25 at 8 p.m. Each will
make to 25 minute presenta-
tion on developments in their
respective parties, then joint-
ly they will conduct a ques.
tion and answer session.

During the afternoon and
evening before their, Love
Auditorium presentation, Gil-
ligan and Riegle will meet
with small groups of students
from Davidson, Queens,
Salem and Johnson C, Smith.

Crews said he hoped close
contact with such successful
young political figures would
‘awaken all of us to the pos-
sibilities of the future be-
cause of the example of their
success.'’ They ‘‘demonstrate
that there are still ways to
solve problems from within
the establishment.”’ he said.

Though this year’s sympos.
ium deals with poltics, Crews
pointed out that a different
area of interest is highlight.
ed éach year.

The symposium will be
broadened next year, Crews
sald. He said that planning
this program is “year-
round work’’ and that the
committee hopes to start
work earlier for noxt year’s
symposium.

The principle idea for next
year is to increase the num-
ber of speakers to four or
six. This will give more stu-

dents the opportunity to come.

into personal contact with
outstanding men. Crews said.

The symposium program
at Davidson is modeled af-
fer fhe Wake Forest and
Vanderbilt symposiums.

The other program, Stimu.
lus, sponsors discussion
groups on pre defined issues.

According to Charles New-
ton. head of Stimulus, the
premises of the program are

“Many of the school

mented Pyeatt. “and ideally
that’s part of the goal of the
program to improve the
student's self-image . . . his
self-concept . . to let him
know he can succeed.”

Both Pyeatt and Randy

the tutorial program, have

“Presently we are work-

North End YMCA Is Proposed;

Are Our ‘Memberships’ Good?

By DAVID GRISSETT
Staff Writer

The building of a branch of the Charlotte YMCA
has been proposed for the North End of Mecklen-
burg County, i.e., Davidson, Cornelius, and Hunters
ville areas.

The tri-town effort is headed by Robert T.
Stone of Davidson, an insurance representative for
Northwestern Mutual Life, who hopes that the Da-
vidson students and fraternities will support the
membership drive.

. Approximately $25,000 will be needed for the

4 organization and programs of the YMCA. An ad-
ditional $50,000 would be necessary to construct
a ¥ building with its own facilities. The building
goal of next year will be dependent on the success
of the charter membership drive.

Stone believes that current student memberships
could be automatically transferred to the new
braneh. However, this policy of membership and
dues has not been rujed upon by the YMCA budget
committee. A meeting is scheduled for tonight.

Scott Woodmansee. chaplain and adviser to the
student YMCA, said that the student Y is just a
part of the national organization; and thus an addi-
tional. but possibly reduced, membership fee. might
be charged to students joining a community YMCA.

Board Depends On Contributions
Funds To Help Low-Rent Project

Staff Writer

After several years of defi
cit spending, the Davidson
YMCA is working to balance
its budget for this year's
overations.

While the‘ Y's expenses
have outdistanced income by

some $2,000 in the last two
years, it has been able to
cover the deficit so far by
drawing from funds stock-
piled in previous years. Tnis
year, though. only $281.52
remains as carryover funds.

see explained.

This year’s fund drive col-
lected some $3,500, accord-
ing to YMCA _ President
Emerson Bell. As last year's
budgeted expenses were
$3621.17, current income
should suffice for the present
program.

A major item in the an-
nual YMCA budget is the
Spring Gift Fund, the size of
which varies with the amount
of funds available. Last year
the YMCA gave $1000 to four
charitable organizations.

“This Tund serves to take
up the slack in yearly pro
gram expenditures, Wood.
mansee said. ‘‘We want our
budget to be flexible enough
so we cah handle whatever
comes up.”

The YMCA budget is partly
determined by requests sub-
mitted to the board by its
subcommittees. Last year.
STEP's expenses totaled
$288.95 and the Deputations
Committee, which furnished
gasoline for students working
in area churches, spent
$147.50.

Freshman Camp, which in

the past has operated with a
separate treasury, collected
approximately $3000 from
last year's freshmen. The
camp normally makes a
small profit. in the $50 to $60
range, which is handed over
to the general YMCA treas-
ury, last year’s President
Marshall Guill said.

formally to exchange. views
and request funds. The
Cabinet. is primarily an ad

take stands when the YMCA
wishes to. take an, official
position on an issue.

Bel! commented that the
YMCA approach was ori.
ented toward people rather
than Issues, and that this
was the reason thaf many
students are unaware of
the large number of YMCA
Programs on cempus and
in the community.

“You get involved with is
sues _ indirectly, but your
first encounter is with in
dividuals," Scott said. He
cited the YMCA‘'s support
for the barbershop boycott
as an example.

Paul Schneider, who ran
for YMCA president last
year, also feels that the
YMCA should go beyond be-
ing just a service organiza.
tion. “I felt that the 'Y’ could
be more active in communi-
ty relations,’’ he said.

Sehneider commented fa-
vorably on the progress that
the YMCA has made in this
direction in the past year,
citing the growth of STEP.
the planned community cen.
ter, and the pamphlet put
out last fall by the YMCA ex-
plaining its programs to stu.
dents as steps toward great-
er community activity. The
appointing of the Commis-
sion on ExtraCampus Re-
sponsibilities is another
promising step. “A lot of
those things I had as com-
plaints I don't have any
more,’ he said. -

The independence of the
YMCA is sacrificed to
some extent by the inclu.
sion of the entire student
body in Its membership,
“Schneider commented. He
sald that the YMCA has
remained primarity a ser-
vice organization because
of the broad base of mem-
bership, while a smali de.
dicated group can take
more definite action.

The deputations program is
one of the Y's main pro
grams in the area of wor

and who are accepted for the
program are farmed ott to

ers. Most students involved
in the program work with
high school students, though
some also work with ele.
mentary school youngsters.

According to Ran Coble,
representative for deputa
tions in the new YMCA cab-
inet, ‘There are probably
about 25 individuals involved
in the present program, most
of whom serve not as lay
supply ministers, but as
youth leaders."' According to
Coble. THE DAVIDSON
deputations program pro.
vides a unique opportunity,
not only for meaningful di-
rect contacts with indivi-
duals, but also for putting

one’s faith to work in the
real world.

Many of the churches in
volved are. as Coble noted.
somewhat small and rural.

although the  deputations
program is in effect in
Statesville, Concord, and
Charlotte: “However, there

always ‘seem to be individ.
uals who are. acutely aware,
even in the rural church
groups. individuals who can
make us re orient our think
ing.”

Coble stressed that the
deputations program is
beneficial not only for the
Davidson student. but also of
great meaning to the
churches involved.

“Young people today are
looking for someone with
whom they can communi-
cate. A concerned college
student can often skirt age
barriers which exist between
youths and their parents or
advisers," Coble sald.
