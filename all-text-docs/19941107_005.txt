Health and Wellness week includes shows, fairs,

By Mary Clare Jalonick
: The flu season is closing in,

and classes are becoming harder as
the semester progresses. Davidson
students are finding themselves
physically and mentally drained,
and the Student Health Center is
trying to do something about it.

This week, students will have
the chance to participate in a mul-
titude of events sponsored by the
counseling center and the infir-
mary. “Health and Wellness
Week” will include shows,fairs,
and music. Dr. Ruth will speak,
and the AIDS quilt will be dis-
played.

The week will start with a
stand-up comedian. On Monday

night Davidson graduate Brad Grif-
fin will perform at the Union Out-
post, relating his own college an-
ecdotes and emphasizing “the hu-
morous side of life.” The show
will be a coffee house sponsored
by Jumpin’ Java, S.E.R.C.H., and
‘tthe International Student Associa-
tion, Counselor Nance Longworth,
whohelped organize the week, says
that it is necessary to laugh every
once in a while because “‘life is
short, life is hard, and it needs to be
taken with a large dose of humor.”

On Wednesday the Health
Center will sponsor a health fair
entitled “Just for the Health of It.”
Students, faculty, staff, and com-
munity members will set up booths

in front of Chambers that promote
wellness, activity, and relation.
Students will have the chance to
learn how to repair a bike or in-line
skate, receive a massage or a flu
shot, have their blood pressure or
body fat checked, hear about
Davidson Outdoors and campus
safety, eat healthy foods and bev-
erages, or play ultimate frisbee.
These are only a few things that the
fair will offer.

Dr. Ruth Westheimer will then
come to campus Wednesday night
fora much-awaited talk which will
answer every student’s questions
about sexual health. Her lecture,
entitled “Sexually Speaking,” will
be at 7:30 p.m. in Love Audito-

rium.

The culmination of the week
will be Thursday night with the
arrival of the NAMES Project —
AIDS Memorial Quilt. Opening
ceremonies will be at 7:00 p.m.,
and a tree will be planted as a
memorial to all Davidson students
who have died of AIDS. The ex-
hibit will be displayed through
Sunday.

Counselor Georgia Ringle
says that she hopes that every
Davidson student will see the quilt
“whether they have been touched
by AIDS or not. People will be so
impressed and moved by its size
and scope.”

In conjunction with AIDS

and music

awareness, the movie Philadelphia
will be shown by the Films Com-
mittee on Sunday and Thursday
nights. A student fashion show
will be held on Saturday night to
benefit AIDS, and a dance will
follow in the 900 Room.

The week promises to be very
informative forall students. Clubs,
organizations, eating houses, local
health centers and businesses, fac-
ulty and staff are joining together
to remind students that health is a
priority. Longworth seems excited
about the week. “It really is a
collaborative effort. The idea is to
emphasize wellness. Instead of
being reactive, we are trying to be
proactive in our approach.”

SGA discussion on presidential requirements continues

By Meg Wolff

“We are not debating whether
or not Davidson College will re-
tain its Presbyterian affiliations,”
stresses SGA President Eric
Rosenbach. “It is important for
people to realize that this is merely
a discussion about the college’s

requirement that its president be a
Presbyterian,”

The Ecumenical Council, rep-
resented by sophomore Darrell
Smith, has been vocal in the recent
SGA discussions. Smith argues that
even though Rosenbach’s proposal
is merely to evaluate the role of

artists.”

Kim is pleased to have been
chosen for the directory. “I gave
them a selection of several of my
paintings. I kind of thought they
would choose ‘Lucy’ because it’s
really colorful and would make a
good directory cover.” He credits
Stockdale for coming up with the

idea of promoting student artists.

Stockdale intends to visit the
senior art exhibit every spring to
get new cover ideas. In the future,
Stockdale suggests that he might
build on the idea and include a
collage of several artworks. He
explains that the cover is not lim-
ited to student art and that he has no
plans to make the selection pro-
cess into a contest.

Prebyterianism in the job of the
college president, this proposal
would only produce other ptopos-
als that would question and even
compromise the college’s ties to
the Presbyterian church.

Smith says “though the Ecu-
menical Council recognizes that
not all people are opposed to this
proposed resolution, it seems that
most people I have spoken to are
opposed, mostly because they see
this proposal as an indication that
the college is drifting away from
the church, and they would like to
put on the brakes.”

Smith also maintains that the

Presbyterian church and a Presby-
terian president are “sources of
guidance and direction for the col-
lege, and the college should recog-
nize the role of religion in shaping
it into what it is today.”
Advocates of the proposed
resolution support Rosenbach’s
view that the policy requiring the
president to be Presbyterian is dis-
criminatory aginst qualified appli-
cants who are neither Presbyterian
nor would be willing to change
their religious affiliations to be-
come president. Also, the current
policy limits the applicant pool of
those who are Presbyterian and

even may be discriminatory ra-

: cially since there are not signifi-

cant numbers of African-Ameri-
cans or minorities that are Presby-
terian, according to advocates.

The issue will continue to be
discussed in the SGA. Rosenbach
emphasizes that the resolution is
only in the discussion stage and
that all he is trying to do right now
is to promote debate on the subject.
“The resolution may not ever be-
come a resolution, let alone pass
through the SGA or the trustees,”
says Rosenbach, “but the debate
can only be healthy for the col-
lege.” -
