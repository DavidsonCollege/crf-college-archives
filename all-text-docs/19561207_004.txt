the street or even the conductor of
the prison train might have been
seized to fill the quota. “Tell me,”
he said, “what kind of security
can you have in this?”

The Russians bore no respect for
persons. Of the nine miliion people
in Hungary, about half were wom-
en. A Red Cross service from
Switzerland went into Hungary in
an effort to check the spread of
venereal disease in the early nine-
teen fifties.

They discovered that over a mil-
lion and a half of the women, be-
tween the ages of three and ninety-
four, who reported for inspection,
were sick as a result of the mass
rape by the Russians.

The Russians tried to destroy
every sense of loyalty except that
to the Communist. Pictures of
young girls and boys, bearing the
title, “National Hero,’’ were seen
on the walls throughout Hungary.
They were being praised for in-
forming on their own parents who
held secret desires for freedom,

who ‘nightly relished the news of
ithe outside world over Radio Free
Europe.
| Dr. Szentivanyi said earnestly,
“If the people of any nation have
any sort of Communism, you can
be sure that they will want in-
stead to be free. Those who have
had contact. with it are vaccinated
‘against Communism.”

He felt that. the Hungarian re-
volt had been ‘an inevitable re-
,action against so many years of
{Communist oppression. “The Hun-
garian people have a long tradition
| for fighting for freedom. But most
of all. they want freedom not only
‘for themselves but also for all the
nations of the world.”

first time in many years.

The Russians taught the children
to use guns; but in the revolt,
those teenagers rushed to seize
the machine guns from the disabled
tanks, and taught the older people
how to use them against the Reds.

“Nevertheless,” he reflected

sadly, “I'm very sorry I had to

leave. I didn’t want to leave, but.

freedom is most important.” For
those who stayed, there remained
only death in an active fight, slow
death, mentally as well as physi-
cally, or deportation to Siberia.
He remembered how, when the
refugees were arriving in New
York harbor, the women began to
weep on seeing the Statue of Lib-
erty. .

Translates Messiaen Home for

Professor John Satterfield of the
Music Department has just had
published his translation from
French to English of Olivier Mes-
siaen's “The Technique of My Mu-
sical Language,” in two volumes,
by the publishing house of Al-
phonse Leduc of Paris.

Messaien 1s a professor at the
National Conservatory of Music
in Paris, and, according to Satter-
field, is “one of the leading con-
temporary French composers”
Messiaen’s book “deals with his
solutions to the technical problems
of composers and his methods of

constructing music in a logical.

way.” Messiaen is best known for
his organ compositions, and much
of his work has been recorded
here in the United States.

Satterfield originally read the
book in French and thought that
it should be offered in English
too, so that everyone would have
the opportunity to read it.

When he wrote the publishers of-
fering to translate it for them, they

immediately responded with a con-!

tract. Satterfield received a copy
of the new translation this week,
but Leduc has not announced the
date when it will be offered for
sale in this country.
