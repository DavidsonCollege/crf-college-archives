Cats 1-3: after San Juan Shootout, loss to Wake Forest

FE reshman guard Elder out for six weeks

By LARRY DAGENHART

The -1988-89 edition of
Davidson basketball opened its
first season as an. independent

with a 57-55 win over Southwest.

Texas State in the first round of
the San Juan Shootout. -

The Cats were lucky to win as
they committed 25 turnovers and
made only 19 of 42 free throw
attempts: Nine of those misses
were front ends of one-and-one
opportunities.

“That’s probably a national
record for missed free throws,”
said Coach Bobby Hussey. “But
I’m happy to win,” he added.

Davidson led by eight at
halftime, 31-23 and in the second
half by as many as 14 after Dick
Seidel made two free throws to
put the Cats up 49-35, topping an
11-4 Davidson run.

Southwest Texas State cut

Davidson’s lead to two at 55-53
with 1:07 to play, but Bruce Elder
who led the Cats with twenty, hit
two free throws to extend the lead
to four.

Southwest Texas State misseda
field goal attempt on its next pos-
session and Magic Gaines, who
was fouled as he snagged the re-
bound, missed the one-and-one.

The Bobcats rebounded and got
a basket from Torgeir Bryn to pull
back within two with 15 seconds
remaining.

Although the Bobcats -re-
bounded «yet another missed
Davidson foul shot, they ran out
of time and never got a shot off,
sealing a Wildcat victory.

Saturday’s semifinal game was
another story. Davidson shot a
disappointing 18-39 from the
floor and was out-rebounded 30-
15 in a 67-44 loss to South Caro-

lina State.
* “We were just a bad basketball

team tonight,” said Hussey. “We
didn’t do anything well.”

The big blow Saturday was the
injury of Elder, who led all scor-
ers in his first college game the
previous night.

Elder broke his hand during an
afternoon practice, putting him
out of action for what could be six
weeks.

Sunday, in the consolation
game, Davidson got the privilege
of playing nationally-ranked
(#11) Villanova and fell 63-47.

Villanova was led by Doug
West, who scored 18 points, 12 of
which came on three-point field
goals. Alan Hunter led Davidson
with fifteen and was the only
Davidson player in double fig-
ures.

“They simply have too much

talent and ability,” said Hussey.
“We were doing a good job defen-
sively in the first half then West
got those quick three-pointers.”
” Villanova led 36-21 at halftime
and later in the second half by as
much as 28 (55-27). Davidson did
not get a field goal in the second
half until the eleven minute mark
but eventually trimmed the final
margin to sixteen.

On Wednesday, the Cats made
their first appearance in the new
Charlotte Coliseum against ACC
foe Wake Forest. The scene was
different, but the story was the
same: Davidson scored only 47
points in a poor offensive perfor-
mace.

Wake Forest prevailed by nine,
56-47.

The Deacons jumped out to a
20-8 lead in the first half, as the
Wildcats struggled offensively,

shooting only 31% from the field.
_ Atthe half, Wake Forest led 30-
20.
The Wildcats made a run early
in the second half and closed the
gap to four at 36-32. Instrumental
in this assault were juniors Jay
Schmitt and Alan Hunter.

‘Schmitt led all Davidson scorers

with fourteen points, and Hunter
made several key plays in the run.

Davidson again pulled within
four at 44-40 with seven minutes
to go, but the offensive woes re-
surfaced, and Wake Forest scored ©
12 points to Davidson’s seven
over the final minutes.

Sam Ivy led the Deacons in
scoring with fifteen.

The Cats returned to the cozy
confines of Johnston Gym Satur-
day only to be whipped by Wof-
ford 71-49 ina late game. Eckerd
College visits tonight.

The football decision examined

By HAP BRYANT
In an issue wrought with so much emo-
tion, I hesitate to walk where angels may
fear to tread. The decision to change the

. Status of the football program from Divi-

sion I-AA to Division III so intimately
effects many members of the college com-
munity that a columnist is in a no-win
situation when addressing the issue.
However, the question and the apparent
answer are both important to life here at
Davidson, so it is necessary to examine the
decision to lower the football program. |
First, there is the personal side, Many
football players could not receive a
Davidson education without the help they

get from the Wildcat Club. In Division III,

this aid must end. The Admissions and
Financial Aid Office will take up some of
the slack in its packages, but certainly this
will not be enough for many football play-
ers. ®

The recent decision basically, without
any prior warning, told these students that

- they will have to fend for themselves finan

cially. This is unfair and a travesty.

Furthermore, most, if not all, current
football players and, coaches came to
Davidson under the assumption that they
would have a five-year period to right the
program. Apparently, after four years, the
Trustees have decided not to honor this
commitment.

Was it a gentleman’s agreement or a

contract’ In either case, it seems grossly
wrong for the Trustees to renege on their

commitment to the football players and
coaches.

Why? Because honor i is the Davidson
way.

Then there is the public side. The issue
gets very tricky here. On a personal level,
it does not take a genius to figure out that
the decision was wrong. However, the
public perceptions cloud such an hans:
ently simple issue.

In the last four football seasons,
Davidson has won two games, both against
Wofford College, which competes in
NCAA Division II. Not since 1982 has
Davidson beaten a Division I foe. Now,

like it or not, in a futile situation like this,
people are going to start asking questions.

The failure of the football program to
give any signs of improvement on the
scoreboard has caused Davidson public
embarrassment.

Every school wants to have successful
athletic programs. It is not enough to say,
“We are the smallest Division I school by
far, and we uphold high academic stan-
dards.” ,

People want to Se wins on the score-
board, not moral victories that still go down
as losses.

No matter what the offitial statement
says, the lack of success on the gridiron
caused the move to Division III. Had the
team won two or three games this year, the
Trustees would have probably decided to
wait another year.

Unfortunately, the football program
seemed to continue its past tradition, and
the Trustee Athletic Committee could not
stand it any longer.

What second-guessing this produces!
Apparently, had the ball bounced
Davidson’s way on one or two occasions,
had the East Tennessee field goal kicker
lost his balance in the waning moments of
the game against Davidson, etc., the foot-
ball program would have continued in
Division I.

If a bullfrog had wings...

Why all the rhetoric about finances? In
talking to President John Kuykendall,
Athletic Director Kit Morris, and football
coach Vic Gatto, I got the impression that

‘Division III is not a cheaper prospect than

Division I, at least for football.
So, it seems that someone is trying topull

_ the wool over our eyes.’

Once again, we find honor at the bottom
of the issue. The administration and Trus-
tees owe every. member of the Davidson
community an honest explanation for the
decision.

Was the decision the right one to make?

; In the long run, probably so. Butthatdoes_ ,
_ not make it any easier for the players or

coaches who are immediately affected.
Nor does it mean that the issue has been

» handled in the right way. Because it hasn’t
