STUDENTS, FACULTY USE COLLEGE'S IBM COMPUTER
The Computer Does Everything From Bidding Bridge To Checking Attendance

improvements In Union

The College Union has under-
gone several physical changes
recently in an effort to provide
more efficient service for stu
dents and visitors.

The most noticeable change is
the removal of @ wall and the
relocation of Mrs. Carol Cook's
desk. She will serve as recep-
tionist and provide information
for students and = visitors.

Behind the desk is a new of-
fice that will be used for stu
dent activities. This will house
the office for the presidents of
the Intefraternity Council, Un-
ion and Social Council.

Tom Covington, assistant Un.
ion director, has a new office
next to that of C. Shaw Smith,
director of ‘the Union. Grover
Meetze, director of the physical
plant, says that the partition for

both of these offices are ‘Hous
erman partitions which are
moveable and easily relocated
when need for them changes.”

Meetze said this !s the sec-
ond time renovations have been
made in the Union. Further
plans include the building of
book cases and the addition of
louvered shutters on all the win-
dows.

Blinds and shades are being
designed for the Morrison room
“that will be cheaper and easi
er to maintain over the long
haul,"" according to Covington.
“This is about all we can do
with the money available.”

In discussing the present state
of the Union, Covington said
with the exception of the auxil-
iary dining room and the lobby,
the Union provides a pleasant

atmosphere

The eye sore in the Union is
the dining area opposite the
snack bar that Covington de
scribes as “Davidson's intensive
care unit.”’ It has recently been
improved by the addition of sen
ior Herb Jackson's painting and

is scheduled to be painted as
soon as labor is available.

He would like to create in
this area a place where stu-

dents and faculty could meet for
coffee or lunch, engage in invig
orating conversation and get: to
know each other better.

The biggest problem the Un
ion faces space utilization.
Covington said ‘‘more meetings
than ever are being held in the
Union.” There is a lack of stor-
age space and one of the up-

William E. Wolff Outlines Diving Procedures For Class

Learn Proper Methods

to lesser pressures nearer the after the course is over.

Scuba diving students are
learning the techniques of the
sport, in classes sponsored by
the Student Council.

These classes are conducted
by Willliam E. Wolff, a former
scuba instructor at the YMCA in
Chariotte. Two classes are held
weekly, on Monday and Tuesday
nights.

So far there have been two
class sessions of the eight-ses-
sion course. The first covered,
among other things, regulators
(one-hose, two-hose, etc.), cal-
culation of the amount of air
left in a tank and charts on how
long a person can stay down
without getting the bends.

The second covered the proc-
ess of decompression, or coming
up out of the water from the
higher pressures of deep water

surface.

Snorkel and tank sessions and
lectures vary the course. The
scuba classes have the approval
of the Athletic Department, so
the group will use the college
pool for its water sessions.

After the course is completed,
the class will dive in a spring
near Statesville if weather per-
mits. Since the students will be
familiar with the basics of skin
and scuba diving, they will then
be ready for open water diving
with an experienced person.

Members of the Davidson class
may become members of the
Scubateers, a club consisting of
interested graduates of Wolff's
program. The club will partici-
pate in open water dives in the
spring and fall of next year. In
this way the program continues

Classes here are conducted on
strictly an interest basis. The)
cost is $18, and students are ex-
pected to furnish some basic
equipment, a mask, fins and
snorkel.

representative, is handling all

Promise Better Service

stairs dining areas is being used
for storage.

The first priority need, when
additional. money available,
is to redecorate the upstairs lob
by. The students should have
their own area in which to watch
TV and read magazines instead
of this ‘‘noisy area where there
is constant activity.’ This area
one where prospective stu
dents and dignitaries are brought
and should be more attractive,
according to Covington.

“The computer here at David-
son is for use by the students
as well as by the administra-
tion,” stressed Dr. Jerry Rob-
erts, assistant professor of
mathematics and faculty super-
visor of the computer facili.
ties.

Roberts added that the com-
puter, an IBM 1620, is used at
present about half the time that
it might be used. According to
him, the college requires a min-
imum of instruction for a stu-
dent to obtain a license for using
the computer.

There are a number of stu-
dents working without faculty
supervision on various projects.
Generally the only real profit
has beef experience, but as Rob-
erts noted, several recent grad
uates have found such experi
ence useful in getting into grad
uate school.

Junior Ron Dougherty has pro
grammed the computer to bid
bridge hands.

He has programmed it to bid
and rebid by either opening or
responding Dougherty comment
ed that since he has taught the
computer to bid he has changed
his. own bidding method.

Steve Lee, also a junior, has
programmed the computer to
harmonize figured bass lines
and compose 17th century cho
jrales in the German style. He}
says he is working toward com- |
plete four-part counterpoint.

A student may take any of}
three courses, Math 21, 43 or 44, |
to qualify for a license to use |
the computer. Previous. training,
however, may be sufficient.

Two Problems Plague
Plans For Eating Club

Plans for establishing an eat
ing house for Independents are
still in the elementary’ stages,
according to Joe Obenshain,
Senior spokesman for the In
dependents.

There are two major pro
blems. First, out of seven stu-
dents on a committee studying
the purpose of an eating club,
all but one have graduated or
left Davidson. Therefore the pri
mary concern is to reorganize

the committee.

Last year’s chairman, who
transferred from Davidson, also
has not yet returned the ques
tionaires in which he collected
student opinion concerning the
proposal.

With a new student committee
and the final results of the
questionnaire (over 90 students
indicated positive interest to
join such a club), the Indepen-
dents will be prepared to ap

Berman As Speaker

Dr. Daniel Berman, professor
of political science at American
University in Washington, D. C.,
and the first YMCA great issues
speaker at Davidson this year,
will speak on the ‘‘New Left in
the United States" during chap
2] period Monday.

Berman received his AB de
gree from Rutgers University,
AM from the University of Wis-
consin, and his PhD from Amer-
ican University.

He is the author of two text-
books used in political science
courses at Davidson: A Bill Be.
comes A Law: The Civil Rights
Act of 1960 and A Bill Becomes
A Law: Congress Enacts Civil
Rights Legislation.

The main theme dealt with by
the YMCA Great Issues speak-
ers this year is the social revo-
lution in the United States. The
other two speakers are Dr. Den-
nis Doolin, Red China analyst
from the Hoover Institute of
Stanford University on Dec. 5

proach the administration of
Davidson with evidence of stu
dent concern.

Obenshain said that there
would be no eating house be-
fore next year at the earliest.
The college must give permis-
sion to hire an architect to de
sign the house. Then the admini
stration will be able to approach
the financial problem.

Last year there was much
controversy over the split in the
academic and social life at
Davidson. Many students thought
that one studied in thé Cham
bers Building and played in the
Union or in fraternities.

With the proposed eating
house, Obenshain seeks to “‘in-
tegrate the various activities of
student life - both social and in
tellectual.”’

The establishment of a house
he said, in which a number of
students can eat, learn and en
tertain, would permit a more
unified and a freer individual
life.”*

Stephenson comes to Dayvid-
son with a background of ex-
perience with processing sys-
tems. Part of his job is con-
cerned with devising programs
for any task not already mech
anized with the aid of these sys-
tems.

One problem here, emphasized
Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts, is that of coordinating
the various questionnaires and
forms used inside or outside of

the campus to eliminate repeti-
tion.

Student reaction is also a fac-
tor, but Burts found a large part
of the student body enthusiastic
about such programs as com-
puter dates for freshmen mix-
ers.
