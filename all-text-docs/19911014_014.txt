weeks of studying. Going to the
infirmary may be tedious, but it
would be worse to be in bed at
home or in the hospital.

4) Avoid caffeine as much as pos-
sible. Take showers to wake up,
listen to music, go running. Caf-
feine is terrible for people who
have sensitive stomachs. It aggra-
vates ulcers and cramps. It is not
good for your immune system, and
if you get sick, caffeine will slow
down your recovery because you
won’t get enough rest.

5) EAT-- evenif you don’t feel like
it. Your body needs food even when
you are sick. You will feel faint
and dizzy on top of your other
symptoms if you don’t eat. You
need nutrients and vitamins to get
better. If you feel nauseous, eat
what you can keep down.

6) This may seem obvious, but DO
NOT DRINK ALCOHOL when
you are sick. This is incredibly
stupid for several reasons:

-If you are taking medication,
alcohol will increase its effects.
Anything like Nyquil or Benadryl]
will make you drowsy anyway. If
you drink when you take these
drugs, you could go into a coma.

-Alcohol has a numbing ef-
fect. When you drink, you will not
feel your sore throat or headache.
However, you will feel worse in
the following days.

-We cannot describe how a
hangover feels when you are al-
ready sick. Every partof your body
will hurt, all your joints will ache.
You will wake up feeling like
someone very fat is sitting on you.
Your limbs will feel heavy. It will
hurt to move. You will be too dizzy
to sleep and in too much pain todo
anything productive. And as you
go over the events of the night, you
will curse yourself for not staying
sober. Aspirin may helpalittle, but
you will feel awful until you go to
bed that night.

7) Listen to your body. That sounds
really corny, but we’re serious. If
you a get sore throat, pay attention
when it first starts to itch. If you
start coughing and sneezing or you
feel weak, take it as a sign. Take it
easy when you feel a little run
down. Sometimes y6u can stop
illnesses before they actually start.
Don’t wait until you have a fever
of 104 and no feeling in your limbs
to consider doing something about
it. Beahypochondriac sometimes-
- it may save you a lot of doctors’
bills, missed classes, and missed
parties.

By opening this article with
words with scrambled letters, we
hope to put you, the reader, in the
position of someone who is unable
to read. Into the Streets, the week
devoted to service at Davidson,
begins today with Education and
Literacy Day. Davidson students

participate ima number of literacy ~

projects which fall under the
umbrella of Project X, or Adult
Literacy. In an effort to teach chil-
dren who are at risk of dropping
out of school, tutors work with
sixth graders at a school in Char-
lotte who currently read at a sec-
ond grade level. Tutors also work
with adult students and with Mexi-
can and Japanese students who
want to learn English.

If you are interested in helping
with Project X, please contact Beth
Ford (-6328) or Kelly Thompson

Condoms

the condom oncorrectly. Incorrect
use of a condom seriously de-
creases its effectiveness. Unfortu-
nately, the condoms in our dorm
bathrooms do not include an in-
struction sheet; and the last time I
called Student Health Services they
didn’t have the instructions either.
So, here they are:

1. Place a new condom on the
penis each time, prior to any fore-
play, genital contact or penetration
to avoid contact with any body
fluid that may contain STD organ-
isms.

2. Pull the condom over the
head of the erect penis. Leave about
1/2" space at the end. Some con-
doms have small receptacle ends
which provide the required space
to collect semen. Squeeze the end
slightly to release air and avoid an
air pocket.

3. Slowly unroll all the way to
the base of the penis. If the condom

does not unroll to the base of the
penis, it has been put on incor-
rectly and should be discarded.

4. If a lubricant is desired, use
water-based lubricants. Do not use
oil-based lubricants, suchas those
made with petroleum jelly, min-
eral oil, vegetable oil, or cold
cream, as they may damage the
condom.

5. After ejaculation the penis
should be withdrawn slowly from
the vagina. The top of the condom
should be held firmly when with-
drawing to avoid spilling any
semen.

6. If the condom breaks or, if
for any reason, semen spills or
leaks out during use, itis advisable
that partners cleanse themselves
wherever contact may have oc-
curred, as soon as possible.

7. Store condoms inacool, dry
place,

8. If the rubber material is
sticky or brittle or obviously dam-
aged, do not use it.

9. Remember—never reuse a
condom.

Ken Menkhaus Brings
International Experience to Davidson

By David Smyth

New AssistantProfessor of Po-
litical Science Ken Menkhaus hails
originally from
Cincinnati, Ohio,
where he also
went to college at
Xavier Univer-
sity. At age 12
his family moved
to Columbia,
South Carolina
where he eventu-
ally attended
graduate school
there, at the Uni-
versity of South
Carolina.

Menkhaus is
an international
relations and
comparative poli-
tics specialist
within the Politi-
cal Science De-
partment. His
course load this
semester includes
International Political Economy,
Politics and International Relations
of Africa, and a seminar on North-
east African Politics.

He finished his dissertation in
1989 and left for the American
University in Cairo for a two-year
stint where he taught a predomi-
nantly Egyptian studentry. Origi-
nal plans had him staying in the
Middle East for another year or

two. With the advent of the Persian
Gulf War last fall, though,
Menkhaus thought it would be a

good idea to seek gainful employ-
ment on safer soil. A spot conven-
iently opened at Davidson, and
everyting else just fell into place.
Menkhaus cited Davidson’s
commitment to international stud-
iesasa very attractive quality when
he was deciding where he would
like to teach. The Dean Rusk Pro-
gram, the large number of students
who go abroad at some point dur-

ing their careers, and expansion of
the international focus all con-
vinced him that Davidson would
be a good place to
study and teach.

When asked about
studentreaction to the
gulf conflict,
Menkhaus
downplayed the vola-
tile image. “Life went
on pretty much as
normal. Most of the
Egyptians were suf-
ficiently sophisti-
cated to differentiate
between an individ-
ual and his gover-
ment.”

At the same
time, though, the war
was a very emotional
issue for his students
and their families, as
they were directly in-
volved, economically
and otherwise. His
classes were filled
with Jordanians, Palestinians, and
other nationalities as well as Egyp-
tians, so varying perspectives made
easy labeling impossible.

Menkhaus likes Davidson stu-
dents, and is excited to find that
they seem curious to learn about
more than just the class material.
So far, Davidson seems tolike him
as well.
