In these days. of
military mindedness,
two ROTC battalions,
and a questionnaire in
every P. O. box, ex-
Major Crowell Little
blew the dust off his
gold leaves this week,

pinned them on his
sweat shirt, and an-
nounced tiimself as

commander of two pla-
toons.

The pictures of the
Furman game _ influ-
enced the organization-
change, ‘too. ;

Thus, tomorrow
night or tonight (check one, one never knows when this sheet will
appear) the Wildeat is thrown into the nrena to do battle with
the Blue Hosed ones, and this time there will be Fresh troops
ready to hustle in for a goal-line stand when we fumble on the
three.

PLATOONS TO FIGHT FOURTH QUARTER FATIGUE

At the season's outset, Little decided against two platoons
because of a lack of depth. However, after reviewing the Fur-
man game, he has come up with this system as the answer to
the fourth yuarter fatigue that possibly cost his crew its opener.

The offensive flashed brilliantly against the heavier Hurri-
cane, though there was a spot of tarnish here and there by
tumble. And defensively, the Wildcat wall was better than. we
have ever seen it, especially when the chips were down and
Furman throttled, down to our four only to be stopped cold.
That looked like the Davidson the alumni is hollering about—
a club with fight and scrap. That was also the club in the first
half.

The second semester was too much fresh power against
too much tired fight. Jimmy Fasul, for instance, went almost
the entire route without relief. Even a sixty-minute man has
but so much. So again the sportswriters set their typewriters
on automatic, punched ‘‘Davidson”’ and out. spilled “an out-
manned but not outfought band of Wildcats succumbed to the
sheer Weight of numbers tonight .

WHEN ARE MANEUVERS NOT MANEUVERS?

Actually tomorrow night’s Presbyterian test is really ma-
neuvers for the two platoons—not from the standpoint of the
opposition to be encountered, but from the general staff's out-
look. If the defensive line lacks the power that can alone be
had from offensive menor vice versa—then somebody is going
to have to play ‘a lot of football. Gregg and Leach are tenta-
tively slated for both duties at halfback. The line, though,
definitely will function as specialized units. Then the Major
will watch the results, view more movies, and announce his de-
cision as to whether the Wildcats stay on a two-platoon footing
for the duration of the campaign.

The Major, incidentally, was the subjeet of much nice
talk in Memorial Stadium’s press box ‘last Saturday night, and
‘we gathered the plaudits like a poor man after pennies. Every-
one conceded that the Wildcats were a new ball club—one with
zip, fight, and trickery, unmatched in recent years. This they
could tell even in the debut.

By BILL WHITE

that had bogged Davidson's offense last year. “These boys look
like they know what they’re going to do next. Not befuddled
like they were when I saw them last season.’’

Another scout liked Grege: ‘* Lambeth isn’t the only threat
Little has. This kid Gregg is as sharp as a runner as I’ve seen.
Your line’s tougher to crack, too.’’

MR. MEDWIN: “WE WERE LONG OVER D

Furman’s publicity man Jules Medwin, who had been boom-
ing the Hurricane as the best Furman team in a decade, iwas a
sad man at halftime. An upset to Presbyterian, a bad loss to
Washington and Lee (though few would now be ashamed of
losing to this year’s Generals) and now his team was trailing
Davidson by eight points. It was enough to make a guy join the
cireus as an advance agent. He banged his binocular case down
vehemently when a Furman flanker missed that long pass down
the sidelines just before the half. And a Furman fumble two
minutes earlier had brought him out of his seat storming out of
the press box and refusing to look.

After the game, he felt better, believeably enough, and
you almost felt glad for him. ‘‘At. last we showed that power.
It just couldn't hold back any longer. We were long over due.”’
{t’s no shame to lose to a club as pent up as the Purples were.

However, it is not the Baptists but the Presbyterians we |

are denominationaling with tonight. They were rough brethren
on our camping grounds last meeting day. Lets hope we’ve done
a heap of living in the right direction since then.

The first three.days of intramural football have been com-
One onlooker commented on the lack of a sort of hesitation | pleted, and although it is too early to make predictions, it can
be said that every team in the league is loaded with talent. All
of the fraternities have been strenghtened by the addition of
many pledges, however, in most cases returning players com-
prise a large part of the lineups.

In the games played this week the
KA’s, Phi Delts and Betas looked
particularly impressive. The KA‘s
line may prove to be on of the
most powerful in the league. Once
again the Betas’ will feaure a devas-
tating running attack, which will
not be halted often during the sea-
son.

KA’s 24—SPE’s 6

A hard charging KA line proved
to be far too much for the SPE’s
in both teams’ initial game. The
KA line rushed the opposing pas-
sers all afternoon, causing many of
the passes to be intercepted. The
SPE’s scored on a blocked punt
recovered by Cahow, while the KA’s
tallied on two passes and two in-
terceptions, the passes to King and
Ward and the interceptions by
Bachman.

WILDCAT OF THE WEEK: A. C. GREGG

Right off the bat it is evident that
picking the Wildcat of the Week is
going to be about as simple as stat-
ing flatly that a snappy sedan is
far and above a better piece of
automotive engineering than a
multi-tanned truck, or vice versa.

Nevertheless, the fair-haired boy
who was indeed the fair-haired boy
of the Davidson attack against Fur-
man last Saturday, for all his fum-
bling, still edges some very nice
bidders in the line for the first hon-
ors of the season.

A. C. Gregg, the Wilmington lad
who never set the state afire as a
prepper though he was voted his
school’s most improved player his
senior year, showed the slim Me-
morial Stadium crowd that the
only blond in the Southern Con-
ference who runs like a hare gone
haywire is not alone found in Caro-
lina’s Dick Bunting.

Exhibiting a slithery style of
tackle evasiveness that is going to
make him hard to lay a hand on
this fall, the 163-pound sophomore

-V

A. C. GREGG

- [gained a total of 60 yards in eight

tries for a 7 1-2 yard average per
crack. Two of the trips were for
34 from Kine to line, but much
greater in actual ground covered.

In addition to this marks from
scrimmage, Acee hauled back three
kickoffs, one 12 yards which cul-
minated in a fumble, but two
others which brought the Cats 23
and 43 yards, respectively, up the
field. He grabbed four passes from
Lambeth—a 15-yarder which end-
ed in a TD, one good for 10, an-
other good for 22, and a fourth
covering 25 yards before Gregg
bobbled it.

True, the Wildcat of this Week
was more or less erratic in his per-~
formance, but he was also playing
his first college football game—
the only sophomore to start. Hence
fumbles are explainable partially by
nervousness; the running attribut-
ed to ability. Also Gregg’s defen-
sive play was of no weak nature,
and few thought it would be. At

game in which line play was im-
portant; Sutton standing out for
the winners and Hinson for the
losers. The Phi Delts touchdown
came on a long pass from Cutts to
Lazenby.

Sigma Chis 12— Phi Gams 6

The Sigma Chi’s, taking advantage
short passes, were able to bet out
the Phi Gams in the last 10 minutes
of their game. The game was close
up to the point when Berry and
Kelton started completing their pas-
ses. For the Phi Gams Crawley and
Bryson were outstanding in the
line.

Pikas 14—ATO’s 0

In a game full of dropped passes
and interceptions the Pikas proved
to be the stronger and more alert
of the two teams. Both came close
to scoring on other occasions, but
they weren't able to push the ball
across. .

Both of the Pika touchdowns
were made on passes by Martin,
one of them going to Parks and
the other’ to Underwood.

Betas 12—Pi Kapps 6

On the first play of the game,
from scrimmage, the Pi Kapps scor-
ed and appeared to be on their
way to an upset win. However, the
Beta running attack finally started
rolling and they were able to eke
out a victory. The game was mark-
ed with many disputes and vicious
line play. Both of the Beta touch-
downs were scored on short runs
by Church Elliot.

The Kappa Sigs won on default

from the Campus Club.

Blake Watt and Walter Gooch,
names remembered painfully well
by the Presbyterians of North

ing reports say that Jack Harper

Early Wildcat Lead
Wilted Under Heat
Of Furman Explosion

By DICK LILES

Although ‘the Davidson Wild-
cats opened a new season and a new
era of football with a slightly dis-
heartening loss to Furman last Sat-
urday night, indications are that
the boys are really “holding” that
football this year and that better
things will follow.

Furman, fielding a slightly fa-
vored team, came out according to
prediction with a 32-20 triumph in
Memorial Stadium. After being led
through almost the entire game by
a fighting, scrappy bunch of “Wild-
cats’, (Super) Jasonek finally felt
his oats and began galloping, cash-
ing in on a costly Cat fumble to
start things off.

The “Littlemen” jumped to a
quick 7-0 lead in the early minutes
of the contest when they recovered
a Hurricane fumble and went on to
score with Lambeth flipping. The
Cats managed another in the second
quarter and lead 14-6 at the half.

The second half exploded when
the kickoff was dropped and Fur-
man recovered on our own 16.
From here “Sonny” Horton car-
ried over on his first try to nearly
tie the score. Davidson hopped
back on Horton’s fumble on his 48
and Lambeth again passed for the
tally, this time to sub-half, Gordon
Stuart.

Some of the most brilliant de.
fensive work was brought about in
the third period when a 42-yard
run by Horton was stopped just
short of the goal and the unsung
stalwarts of the forward wall held
for just four downs and averted a
score,

However the game blew up for
the Cats in the fourth when, tired
and weary, they couldn’t hold on
to the “Supersonic” by when he
got wound up. Jasonek galloped
off on a long run to score and again
turned a Gregg fumble into a tally
when he picked up a lateraled
“grounder” and scampered about 30
yards for the six.

It was a hard-fought, clean bat-
tle all the way with the slight re-
serve power hindering a strong fin-
ish by the locals. The game brought
out an exchange of abilities be-
tween halfbacks Sonny Horton and
A. C. Gregg (the fair-haired David-
sonian) both in toting the ball and
dropping it. Both had a bad night
of butterfingers, but ran brilliantly.
Woody Leach played a beautiful
game at half and was particularly
zood on his smashes. Auburn seem-
cdi to have started the season off
fine and to break a few records for
he completed 9 out of 18 passes for
a .500 average, completing and pas-
