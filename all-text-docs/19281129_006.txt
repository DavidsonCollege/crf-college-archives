LITERARY SOCIETIES

The feature gf the program of the
Philanthropic Literary Society for No-
vember the twentieth was a forum on
the question “Resolved: That the gov-
ernment should own and operate the
principal sources of water power. The
discussion was started by M. F. Mc-
David for the affirmative and J. W.
McCutcheon for the negative. As this
is the question to be used in the var-
sity debates, much interest was shown.

A declamation by H. McKinnon of
the Freshman class completed the pro-
gram. :

In the Eumanean Society the ques-
tion for debate was, “Resolved; That
the court of control should be ablished
at Davidson.” After a heated debate

Messrs. S. H. Long and D. F. Murphy.
Current events were reported by C.

What. No Honor?
Western Reserve University—(CNA)
—College men have absolutely no con-
ception of the honor system as applied
to cheating in their studies. This
charge was hurled to the lorly males
by delegates from co-educational col-
leges to the 21st annual convention of
the Women’s Intercollegiate Associa-
tion for Student Government held at
the College for Women, Western Re-
serve University. The topic arose
from a discussion group session on the
honor system, which many colleges
use for examination without super-
vision by proctors or teachers.
“The honor system is failing in so
many co-educational schools because
men are not co-operating,” accused
Caroline Robison, delegate from
Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania.
“We don’t say that the, men are not
basically honorable, but they certain-
ly aren’t honorable when it comes to
living up to the honor code that pro-
vides for work done in school without
cheating.”
“That's true!” delegates from Mi-
ami University, Oxford, Ohio, nodded
vigorous agreement, “Men just don’t
take the honor system seriously,” said
one, “As far assthey are concerned,
it’s just a lot of fine sentiment.” Af-
firmation and denials of these state-
ments, colored by personal experience
in co-educational and women’s col-
leges all over the United States, pep-
pered the discussion.

All Love and Kisses
Paris—(CNA) — The Latin quarter
must be all brotherly love and kisses
from now on, since the minister of
public. instruction has vetoed hazing
in schools and colleges. Collegians are
not inclined to live up to the new
edict, however. The time honored
practice of having younger students
is still being observed in violation of
the order, Recently a freshman in the
Ecole Polytechnique was seriously in-
jured while being made to walk the
edge of*a deep ditch blindfolded.

Uncle Sam’s Laundry
Knoxville, Tenn.—(CNA) — Laundry
by mail is a regular custom here at
the University of Tennessee. Post
office Officials say 600 students take
advantage of the service to have their
laundry done at home. Each week the
parcel post laundry bags filled with
soiled linen go out in trucks for wide-
ly separated parts of the country, and
the clean clothes come back the next
week, Some send their garments
far as Towa, Illinois, and. New York.

Interesting Diary Found
Lexington, Va.—(CNA) — How the
gallant “Light Horse Harry” Lee, gen-
the revolution, turned in
moments to reflective com-
ments on prose and poetry is described
in his own handwriting in a diary pre-
sented to Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. A red backed book with Spanish,
English, French and Latin used by the
famous general in keeping his daily
account of his life, most of the writ-
ing is legible despite its age.

Modification for the Co-ed
Evanston, Ill—(CNA)—They’re go-
ing to standardize the books of North-
western University co-eds by operat-
ing a dress clinic. The too-tall girl,
the too-short girl, the too-slender girl
and the too-stout girl will be given a
chance to modify the lines of their
figures to a point where she will be as
attractive as the other. Under the di-
rection of Miss Anna Helga Hong, pro-
fessor of art, the “dress clinic” will aid
every fair co-ed to dress attractively
despite possible handicaps of nature.
Personality as well as build and fea-
tures will be given consideration in the
“dress preseriptions.”

Insect Collector

Cumberland College, Nov. 28.—Chasing
butterflies and moths is helping J. K. Al-
bright of Nashville, a Cumberland senior,
pay his expenses through college. Dur-
ing the time that Albright has been in-
terested in collecting and exhibiting these
insects, he has captured enough to make
a collection of more than. 20,000, which
he regards as the largest in the state. He
places a value of $4,000 on his collection.
In 1927, for the first time, the Cumber-
land student was induced to publicly ex-
hibit his collection and it was sent to
the Tri-State Fair at Memphis and the
Tennessee State Fair. It is estimated that
more than 100,000 have viewed the ex-
lustrated lectures on theysubject of but-
terflies.
Albright will receive the degree of
3achelor of Science in Chemistry from
‘umberland in June, and afterward plans
o teach thousands of rural residents of
he state how to make butterfly catching
profitable. He will give a series of lec-
ures, using natural specimens, photo-
graphic studies and projectorscope slides
in his work. » He also is planning to pro-
duce several motion pictures reels de-
picting the life history and hibits of but-
terflies and moths.

“One of the greatest needs of this coun-
try today is the establishment of club
colleges as near New York as possible,
which will help to free the regular col-
leges of the undesirable materials now
clogging them up,”” he said. “These clubs
will have no libraries and no class-rooms
They will offer close contact with boot-
leggers, lots of ash trays and easy chairs,
all the advantages of fraternity and sor-
ority and plenty of opportunity for socials
recreation.

“Thus would our present universities be
rid of the type of student who, not in-
terested in scholarship, is there for social
reasons and feels that it.is the duty of
the faculty to get him through the exami-
nations.”

mous amount of graft and crime is
bright on by wholesale violation of one
law. ” Philadelphia before the recent
clean-up wanted to drink, and paid
heavily for it. In the past two or thee
years she had paid at least $40,000,000
annually for booze, half of which went
directly to graft. This, however, was
just a part of the price paid. The rest
consists of a general state of lawless-
ness and corruption in the “city of
