announced Friday that he
was assuming the presidency
of Drivelson College because
“nobody else wanted the
job."

“I guess I'll have to give

Simon Legree and Peart

According to Mingle, near

Fraternity Rejection Poses
No “Traumatic’ Difficulties

By THE REV. MR. BOYTE

He appeared to be even
more dismayed at the ques-
tion than at the food on the
tray he set onto the Union
cafeteria table.

Irving Dull's trite gripes
about the food. had been in-
terrupted by a question about
his not having received any
bids during rush.

He laughed nervously at
the suggestion that he had
been rejected by the frater-
nity system.

“No, I wouldn't call it re-
jection,” he said. ‘I don’t re-
ally feel rejected. It’s not ex-
actly’ what I'd call a trau-
matic experience, you know.”

“Things could be worse,”
he added. ‘I mean, we might
have had limas for supper
for the last five times in-
stead of just four.”

What did he pian to do for
Mid-Winters while his old
friends were getting their
first taste of fraternity par-
tes?

“Aw, that’s no problem,”
he answered. ‘‘My hall coun-
selor and I are great friends
and so he has already invit-
ed me to his fraternity’s par-

ties. But I've got a lot of
friends down at Carolina I
haven't seen in quite a while,
so I thought I'd skip all the
confusion here and visit them
this weekend.”

But would have he have
Stayed here if he had pledg
ed a fraternity?

“Well, yeah, I guess I
would have had to go." he

said, ‘‘but I probably would
not enjoy it."

He forked a load of pasty
limas into his mouth, then
said, “You know I think you
anti-Greeks have just got the
thing all wrong. So what if I
was rejected. I guess I'm
just not quite as good as the
rest of the people around
here."

he decided to take a job as
academic dean at North
Mecklenburg High. Legree
said the pay was too low.
while Schlunk was rejected
because he wasn't a Drivel-
son graduate.”

“TI can assure you that we
didn’t leave a stone unturn-
ed."

Mingle said most of the ed-
ucators refused to come be-
cause of the violence and ag-
itation that has been sweep
ing the Davidson campus.
“One guy had heard we put
LSD in the drinking water."
Mingle said.

“The fear of student riots
was so great that one pro-
fessor decided to remain at
the University of Saigon. An-

‘other said he would only

come if we promised him the
use of ROTC troops to quel)
student disorders. When he
heard how cadre officers
have been stirring up revo
lution, he refused to come."

Mingle said his first action

Blue Fly Report Adopted
In Wild Faculty Meeting

By F. F. ANDERSON
Hack Writer

After an all-night meeting
during which they adopted
an extended fail program.
the faculty finally approved
the Blue Fly recommenda-
tions by a vote of 33-31.

The. proposals, which must
be approved by the Bored of
Trusties before they take ef-
fect, called for a substantial
revision in the curriculum
and a doubling of the athletic
subsidy to the Classics De-
partment.

Tom Goodheardt has call-
ed a special required meet-

ing of the student corpse for
every Tuesday for the re-
mainder of the semester to
demonstrate solidarity be-
hind the faculty proposals.

The extended fail program
gives the student govern-
ment the right to require stu-
dents who pass exams to
take them again until they
fail them, This came as a re-
sult of the newly-approved

ment that students partici-

Goodheardt said he is pre-

pared to present a bill in pro-
test to the Student Council
which he has described as
“ultimate ontological disas-
ter to 69 per cent of the stu
dentry.”’

Unconiirmed reports hint-
ed that another provision of
the new faculty program had
renamed the Dean of Stu-
dents’ office the Holy Office.

Twenty-seven more stu-

A brief survey of the stu-

career. It was always an or-

In 1861 THE DRIBBLE-

but finally saw the error of
its way and in 1912 urged se-
cession and avoidance of en
tangling foreign alliances.

Finker Booted For Going
Into Student Automobiles

By ROBERT REID
Hack Writer

Davidson security guard
Ian Finker was suspended in-
definitely by Driveison. Col-
lege this week following
charges that he had broken
into student cars.

In announcing the suspen
sion, Grubber Mess, director
of the physical plant. said a
student delegation had offer-
ed proof that Finker had
been breaking into cars for
most of his 25-year career at
the college.

Tom Goodheardt, delega-
tion spokesman, said he him-
self had seen Finker rum-
maging through cars after
dark. ‘I even saw him check-
ing glove compartments.”
Goodheardt said.

In a press conference held
in the Rare Book Room of
the Drivelson library, Finker
told reporters that he had
been searching for items
which the faculty had ruled
to he ‘‘detrimental’’ to Driv-
elson life, such as liquor, and
subversive literature such as
“Quotations from Chairman
Mao.”

Mint juleps and the ‘‘Life
and Times of Senator Bilbo”
were excepted, Finker said.
The faculty denied his claim,
however.

“I didn’t do nothing,”’ Fin-
ker said, “that any other
red-blooded American citizen

wouldn't have done. I fol-
lowed orders. It was my du-
ty."

Action stemmed from
charges that Finker had
broken into a car parked
near the library following a
dance weekend.

Witnesses said they saw.
Finker crawl into the front
seat and remain there for.
several minutes. When the
owner returned, the glove
compartment had been open-

ed and the contents were

strewn around the car.
Finker claimed that he had

been searching the car for
liquor and that he had found
a bottle in the glove com:
partment, The owner then
charged that Finker was not
in possession of a_ search
warrant at the time of the
search.

There was no external evi-
dence to suggest presence of
liquor in the car, he added.

Conviction of the owner for
possession of liquor led to the
formation of Students To In-
sist on Rights (STIR), which
compiled evidence and pre
sented the evidence.

Frosh Council To
Rat Bounty Hunt

By BOBBY REID
Staffer

The Freshman Council an
nounced this week that it will
pay a bounty of 50 cents for
each rat killed in the fresh-
man dorms next week, The
council also said it award a
hot dog to whoever presents
the largest kill.

“We plan to conduct this
bounty on the honor sys-
tem,” said Little Stevie Won-
der, council president. ‘‘Each

person presenting a rat must
swear on his honor that he
neither gave nor received aid
in its capture.”

The council said it had
planned to conduct this
search last semester, but
since upperclassmen were
not allowed in the freshmen
dorms after 7 p.m. it was felt
that some of the best rat ex-
perts on campus would be
denied the chance to partici-
pate.

“The IFC (Interdormitory

‘We cannot stand for this
flagrant violation of student
rights."’ Goodheardt. shouted
during the press conference.
“Such action is a definite
violation of the student's
rights."

Finker filed an appeal soon
after the suspension, but. ac-
cording to reliable sources
his appeal was turned down.
He was told by Dean Richard
Hertz that there was no pro-
vision for employe appeal.
and that the administration's
hands were tied in this mat-
ter.

to opening the dorms earlier
because the rat poptlation ‘
was not large enough to give
the hunt an element of
sport,’ Stevie said.

The rats are of the Nor-
wegian brown rat family,
which is commonly found in
such slum areas as Harlem.
South Chicago and Watts.
They usually breed and
thrive in areas of filth and
decay, such as the freshmen
dorms.
