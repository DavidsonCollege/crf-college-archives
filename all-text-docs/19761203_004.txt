In a somewhat surprising
move, the faculty voted to
proclaim Dr. Earl MacCor-
mac’s entrance to the godhéad
in a meeting spattered with
intense emotional outpour-
ings, occasional belching ‘and
frequent bawdy, but boring
jokes. Although the majority
of faculty members slipped
away during the early parts of
the meeting, mumbling some-
thing about Monday night
football, the final vote app-
roved MacCorgac’s divinity
by a count of 4 to 8, with
various abstentions and ‘‘who
cares?’’. One vote of protest
was lodged by an expectedly
jilted English professor who
immediately hustled away to
the security of his coed-filled
‘“‘study’’. Reached for com-
ment, he replied amidst barely
controlled tears: ‘‘Fuddidud!
All Christ had was Mary
Magdelen!”’

Dr. MacCormac, aloof
throughout the entire meeting
remained so throughout the
following interview, but com-
mented, always master of a
percing wit, ‘Gee, I’m happy
as a doodle!.Why this is the
most exciting day at Davidson
since Alan Brinkley left.’’ Earl
later added in an intense

In a slightly more serious
vein, Dr. MacCormac com-
mented that being the Mes-
siah would probably differ

_ little from his existence here-
“‘tofore. ‘‘This isn't the first

U

time students have hinted at
my divinity. Who can blame
‘em? I think it was Heraclitus
who said, ‘You can fool some
of ‘em some of the time, the
others don't give a s---!’”

Dr. Spencer was character-
istically lukewarm to the idea
but commented between ser-
ves, ‘‘You can’t beat the
timing. Look at all the atten-
tion that Krishna got. And he
was only an imitation Chink.
My gosh, the endowment’s
bound to go up. This will be
the best thing for Christianity
since indulgences!”’

‘‘And besides,’’ Brother
Sam added, grinning after an
apparently vicious serve, ‘‘I
think we beat Williams to it!’’

Dr. Sam Maloney, leaving
the meeting beaming after
somehow getting himself ap-
pointed St. Paul to Earl’s
Christ, thundered that this
was the most exciting day
“since World War II’’. Bow-
ing his head slightly, but
shouting omnisciently never-
theless, ‘Yes, son, it’s thing

DCF leads messianic march to Concord.

like this that make us thankful
for what the Almighty saw fit
to give us. It’s a real blessing
to have a few slightly, how do
you say, ‘intellectual’ guys on
our faculty and someone with
such a musical voice-as myself
to proclaim them.’’ Fading
away, Dr. Maloney sighed,
‘And there we were, 20,000
feet up, surrounded by flamin’

lions of unidentified, glazed-
eyed and indistinguishable
DCF’ers gathered outside
Chambers .to celebrate the
Second Coming. The president
of DCF, the fastest growing
group on-campus besides
ROTC and illiterates, com-
mented, .‘‘Praise the Lord,
salvations as near as the Big
M.’’ Smiling and spreading
numerous ‘I Found It” pam-
phlets in Dr..MacCormac’s
path as he jogged to Cornelius
to spread the Good News in
his new angel white warm-up
suit, the DCF’ers sang several
out-of-date Billy Graham
numbers which even Will Ter-
ry admitted ‘‘in stinkin’ poor
taste’’. Dean Terry subseq-
uently paralyzed a reporter
with a friendly shoulder clasp,
and hurried to change intoa
more appropriately colored
rugby shirt. ‘‘Green and blue
just wouldn't do‘for the As-
cension, now would it?,’’ he
beamed unconvincingly.

Zach Long, wheezing at the
rear of the procession could
only muster, “But, what will
I wear to the Cruxifiction?”’

Curious as to how this
newly discovered Messiahship

‘ might affect admissions, The

Davidsonian went to the office
of H. Edmunds White. As he
was recruiting in Florida for
‘the month, we were referred to
Mrs. Parnell, who declared,
“Admissions? No, you want
Dr. Frontis Johnston.’’ John-
ston, after inquiries, referred
us to Scotty Nicholls. Mut-
tering something about dogs,
Mrs. Nicholls left in a huff.
Cornering Chip Stone on the
far soccer field, shooting golf
with pleasantly ‘‘retired’’ Bo
Brickels, he exclaimed, ‘‘Cart-
mill done it!’’'Cartmill, embar-
rassed, referred us to Erwin
Brawley, in charge of campus
grounds, who quickly and
appropriately responded, ‘‘We
don’t do much to attract
birds.”’

In a further development,
Ron Scott, ever perceptive of
new trends on campus, cor-
nered Dr. MacCormac with a
few stale hamburger buns and

cold fishsticks. Slightly irate

ac ascends to new post

after initial protestations by
Earl, Scott declared, ‘‘The
least you could do is change it
into meatloaf.’’ Scott, as the
reader will remember is the
somewhat stunted mouthpiece
of those immortal words,
‘“You can fool some of the
people some of the time, but
you can feed these students
any damn thing and still make
a profit.”’

Inquiring as to what secur-
ity measures Dr. MacCor-
mac’s divine status might
entail, we were referred to the
Davidson police department,
operating out of the local 7-11.
Captain Hughes, surrepti-
ciously thumbing through a
worn magazine in the far cor-
ner replied, “These darn hot
dogs just keep gettin’ greasier
and greasier.”’

In an attempt to get a feel of
student reaction to the new
faculty development, The
Davidsonian met with SGA
President Bo Baskin as he ran
half-dressed to his 9 o’clock
class. ‘‘Jeeesus, it makes me
hotter’n a cowpoke with a
saddle bur. Shee-it, I wish the
SGA had thought of it first.
How’s about Marc Menchel as
Buddha?” Disappearing in a
cloud of papers and with an
amazingly incessant Georgia-
style smile, Baskin said that
Earl-was nevertheless a ‘‘fine
man’’ and he hoped the stu-
dents would back him, as he
cleverly added, ‘'105 percent’. :

It is yet unclear exactly
what effect the ‘‘Incarnation”’
will have on this small, rural,
amazingly backward North
Carolina town. One townsper-
son commented that ‘‘them
professors have always been a
little tainted in the haid.’’ But,
for the majority of students
and faculty alike, Dr. MacCor-
mac’s. Messiahship will prob-
ably cause as little a ripple in
the Davidson community as
the recent election. As Rush
Otey put it, “I) shoulda been a
doctor,’ or in'‘the words of an
atrophied student recently un-
earthed in the bowels of the
Rare Book Room, “Shut the
hell up! I've got a f---in’ review
tomorrow!’
