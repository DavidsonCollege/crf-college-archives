Davidson defeated High Point College |
here Friday night 45 to 28 in the first ath- |
letic meet of these schools. The Wildcats |
jumped off to a good lead in the early part |
of the game which the visitors could not |
overcome. The fast offense~ofthe Davidson |
team piled up a 23 to 9 score at the end of
the first half. ;

High Point opened the second period with |
a rush and played the Wildcats on even
terms until Davidson got together and scored
13 straight points near the end of the game.
The close defense of the locals forced the
High Pointers to long shots at which they
were very successful. Hill scored several
pretty baskets from near the center of the
floor,

Anderson and Laird led the Wildcat of-
fense with 15 and 14 points respectively to
their credit, while McConnell showed good
form, scoring seven points. Hauser, center
for High Point, played a nice game. Staley,
of Davidson, was out ofthe game with in- |

juries. Line-up:

ELEVEN TO CLASH WITH -
HICKORY MARCH SEVENTH

The spring football practice is taking
real shape now. Coach Tex is running the |
men through real tough scrimmages and
plays; the old men are showing up well and
the new men that are out for varsity posi-
tions for the first time are rapidly improv-
ing. The first scrimmage was held last
Wednesday; this was very light, but the one |
on the following Saturday was anything but |
easy. Two new plays were explained and |
executed Monday, and there is a promise of ,
several more.

The first game will be played Saturday
afternoon. The squad will be divided into
two sections and a team picked from each. |
This promises to be a real game. A game)
has been scheduled with the Hickory High
School for March 7 also. Hickory boasts a |
strong team, having several old Centre Col- |
lege stars on it and possessing two 190 pound |
tackles. A real fight is expected at this,
game and both are working hard in antici-
pation of it. |

But what has it to do with sports? Noth-

ing except to start a little bull fighting.

Speaking of fighting, what about a little
boxing up here at Davidson. They have it
over.at Carolina, up at V. M. I., and at many
other places.

EAN es:

It’s a far cleaner and more sportsmanlike
game than wrestling. And it’s fine exercise.
The boys might practice in their rooms.

—DC.

For there’s not room enough in the present
gym to start anything else. The biggest need
of the tudent body today is for a gymn well
equipped with all modern apparatus.

We haven't got a place half big enough to
stage a real basketball game. The present
court would do fine for the students’ use.
We should have one with room for the
crowds that would then come.

However, we believe our two Toms could
loop them in on any old court. Anderson has
rung up 55 field goals and enough fouls to
run up a total of 125 points—an average of
10 per game.

pes:

Staley playing in 12 games has an average

of 8 points per game—94 in all.
EREEES p Y Quemuaes

However the class of our team is. in the
two guards—Captain Boggs is headed for
all-state of ever a man was. And “Spec”
rates pretty well as a running guard.

Tonight the Fresh will stage their big
game over in Durham with the Young Bucks.
It would be like icing on cake for the
Yearlings to complete the season with a win
from Duke.

——=$ |) G—_———

The Bucks have perhaps the best Fresh
quint in the state...Alreadythey have beat
Carolina, State and Wake Forest—some of
them twice. _ Their 1926. prospects seem good.

The Wildcats moved up one notch in the |

“big five” basketball standing although they
didn’t play any of the “big five” last week.
In reality Carolina gently- sent the Techmen
sliding from second to fourth.

On Saturday the Wildcats participate in

,at which time they downed N. C. State, but

day the crack V. P. I. team came down and
trounced us for our second defeat this
year.

recently clashed with N. C. State and both

the same weights so forthis reason also the

Much interest has been shown over the

Lose Return Game
To Charlotte Team

In a game somewhat marred by rough play
and football tactics Charlotte Y. M. C. A.
turned back the fight Wildcats with a 29 to
37 score. The game was a very close affair
during its earlier part—at the halfway mark
the score was a 15-15 tie, but in the last half
the Davidson players were unable to keep up
with the hard playing “Y” basketeers. Tom
Staley was the star performer for the Da-
vidson boys, while the Yates brothers were
the leading players for the “Y” quint. The
line-up and summary is as follows:

Davidson (27) Position. Char. “Y” (37)

Staley (9) -. .. -. -. -. -. Neiman (13)
Right forward

Laird (9) -- -. -- -- -- -- -- Milstead (0)

Exactly what are the possibilities in the
state cage race?
DC.

First Place—Carolina gets first honors ex-
cepting one possibility. That is for Wake
Forest to win from Carolina, Duke and
twice from Davidson at the same time that
Carolina loses to State. Such a course would
make the Baptists have a standing of won
seven, lost two, to Carolina’s won five, lost
two. A slim chance.

EEN py gues

Svcond Place—Open to all save Duke Uni-
versity. Carolina might get it in the manner
described above. Wake Forest can get sec-
ond honors by winning from Duke and Da-
vidson twice even though losing to Carolina,
unless State beat Duke and Carolina, which
would give the Techmen second place. Also
if Davidson and Wake Forest split. -

Moral: Win both games from the Bap-
tists and nobody can take second honors
from us.
