THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 26, 1929

Wildcats Conquer Elon Eleven As Visitors Resort to Strong Aerial Attack

SIDE LINE SHOTS

At the 1929 Red and
Black Gridders

By P. R. Alderman

a

Once again the opening whistle has
sent the Wildcat gridders down the turf
at their first foe of a season the outcome
of which is still one big question mark. in
the minds of the majority. However, it
must be admitted that after giving
Monk's squad the once over, things don’t
look so bad after all, this in spite of the
fact. that we only chalked up a 20-6 vic-
tory over the Elon Christians last Satur-
day in the opening game of the season.
As several papers have already stated this
can be more fairly accounted for, not by
any particular weaknesses on the part of
Davidson’s eleven, but by the fight and
strength exhibited in the visiting team—

especially in one Pete Williams, Christian
fullback.

Beyond any doubf Pete was the
outstanding star on the field through-
out the contest last Saturday. Wheth-
er the Elon eleven was on the de:
fensive or offensive, he was always in
the midst of the fight, bareheaded and
limping from an injury sustained early
in the game, but getting his man
nevertheless. His ability to break
through the Wildcat line time after
time to throw Davidson backs for
five and six yard losses was the main
factor in enabling the visitors to score
their first touchdown in eigiht years
against the Red and Black machine.
Credit*must also be given the rest of
the team. Little Zack Walker at
quarterback again proved himself a
menace to any opposition when he
tucked the pigskin under his arm and
started a dash off-tackle or around
end, In fact the whole team furnished.
as much competition as Wildcat sup-
Porters could possibly desire, and al-
most a little too much.

Pete Williams did take more than his
share of the glory, but there is quite a
bit due the Wildcats. McCall and Parrish
twisted and fought their way through the
opposition for many of the 250 yards that
were made from scrimmage,’ while Capt.
Brock at his flank position proved the
mainstay in the line, both in defensive
and offensive work. Steve Brown, Sopho-
more tenant of the other flank, also did
exceptionally good work in his first var-
sity game. It would be almost impossible
to pick out any one man who stood head
and shoulders above the rest, but it can
be truthfully said that every man who
Saw action fought with the Wildcat spirit
_ and showed the courage and grit that tra-

dition has handed down to Davidson
teams,

But the Elon game of this year is
now history and the most important
thing that looms in the minds of Dav-
idsonians is the Clemson-Davidson
clash in Charlotte next Saturday. Fel-
lows, this game is going to decide
many things about the 1929 Wildcat
team and the showing it makes day
after tomorrow will greatly determine
the kind of season we have. Clemson
undoubtedly has about the best team
in South Carolina, as was evidenced
by a 68-0 victory over Newberry, and,
‘as far as that goes, in the South. It’s
going to be a mighty tough game for
the Wildcat eleven, but that only

, means they will fight all the harder.
This has always proven true of them.
And if we Wildcats on thp sidelines
will show our appreciation of this by
backing. them to the limit, there’s go-
ing to be a big surprise in store for

Christians Bow To ’Cats
In First Game Of Season

Davidson Overcomes Elon 20-6—
Visitors Score_First Touchdown
in Eight Years

Monk Younger exhibited his 1929 model
Wildcat team for the first time Saturday
against Elon, and the ’Cats came through
to win handily by a score of 20 to 6. They
showed a well-developed running attack
that could gain almost at will through the
Christian line. There were four hard-run-
ning, shifty backs whose work in the
game bodes no good for future opponents,
and a quick-charging line that opened
wide holes and that stopped the Chris-
tian running attack almost dead.

However, the line and backfield com-
bined were not able to stop a flurry of
Elon passes late in the second quarter that
netted the Christians their first score over
Davidson in eight years. With Williams
and Walker alternating on the hurling
end, the ball was advanced down the field
by a series of passes, long and short, and
finally carried over the line on a pass,
Williams to J. Waggoner. Elon got the
ball on their twenty yard line after a ’Cat
punt. Williams and Waggoner got a first
down, then Williams passed to .Walker
for twenty yards. This was shortly fol-

lowed by a thirty’ yard pass to P. Wag»

goner that placed the ball on the David-
son’s 13 yard line, from where a third
heave took it over. The point was blocked.
The score came entirely as a result of the
beautiful passing attack of the Christians,
coupled with complete inability of the
'Cats to block the passes.

Captain Thad Brock of Davidson turn-
ed in a sterling all-around game. His play
both on defense and offense outshone that
of any other linesman on the field. He
was time and again crashing through the
line to throw the Elon backs for losses.
His offensive play made possible many
long gains for the ’Cats, and his educated
toe counted for two of the three extra
points attempted. On the kickoffs he con-
sistently booted the ball 40 and 45 yards.

As sensational as was Brock’s work, it
was matched by the brilliance of a driving
fullback of Elon by the name of Williams.
Williams backed up the line in a manner
that has seldom been seen on the local
gridiron. Time and again he would stop
the ’Cat backs for no gain or smash
through to throw them behind line. He
was handicapped from the first of the
game by a bad ankle, but it hardly made
any difference in the brilliance of his
play. He would come crashing through
with the ball to make four or five yards
through the center of the line, making
his own hole where there was none, and
taking two or three tacklers with him.
His playing brought bursts of applause
from the stands following many dazzling
defensive or offensive plays. Williams was
the outstanding star of the game, and
mainly through his work was the score
held down to three touchdowns.

Walker, the quarter for Elon was a
wiry, peppy field general. His handling
of punts was almost perfect, and his
passes, for the most part, were accurate.
Morphis, at center, tipped the scales at
only 145‘pounds, but made up in fight for
what he lacked in weight.

Brook was not the only star for the
Wildcats. Red Parrish, playing his first
game in the starting lineup, was an out-
standing ground gainer. He got loose for
several runs of fifteeen yards or more,
mostly in the second half. Joe McCall
plunged and ran more.and farther than
his running mates in the first half..He had
plenty of drive that often carried him

the grid fans when they read accounts
of Saturday’s battle. Let’s talk it up
between now and then and go over
and fight with the eleven to a man!

through the line and into a broken field.
Fraley and Brohard reeled off yardage
so consistently that it became quite pain-
ful to the visitors. The work of Brown,
a Sophomore playing his first varsity
game, did much to quell any rumors as
to the weakness of the ends.

Brock kicked off 50 yards to Kelly to
open the game. A poor punt by Elon, af-
ter they had made a first down, gave the
Wildcats the ball in midfield. Brohard
and McCall carried. the pigskin straight
down the field to the three yard line on
line plunges and off-tackle plays. How-
ever, Brohard fumbled the fourth
down, and the ball went to Elon on their
own eight yard line. After one play Elon
was forced to punt, the ball going only
thirty yards. The ’Cats immediately
marched back down the field in the same
manner as before, and Fraley took the
ball over on one of first plays of the
second quarter. Brock kicked the extra
point to make the score 7 to 0.

Brock kicked off 60 yards to Kelly, who
returned to his 20 yard line. Elon then
advanced the ball by a series.of passes
to score their only tally of the day.
Mathis blocked the extra point and the
score stood 7 to 6 in favor of Davidson,
the half ending in a few plays.

The Wildcats came back ‘fighting in
the third quarter and put over two mark-
ers. The first score was featured by a
pass, Brohard to Parrish, which netted
20 yards, and McCall’s run of 20 yards
to carry the ball over the line. Brock
again made the point.

Elon received the kickoff, but lost the
ball in their own territory a minute or
two later when Brohard snared a pass
and assisted by a fifteen yard run by Par-
rish, he carried the ball over for another
touchdown. It required only nine plays
to score from midfield. Brock missed the
point, and the fourth quarter went score-
less.

A woeful weakness in a pass defense
was the outstanding defect of the ’Cats. |
Elon had practically no trouble in com-
pleting its passes, fumbles on the part of
the receivers knocking them out of more
completed passes than did any hindrance
given them by the Davidson players.

The.crying need of the Wildcat team is a
quarterback. Everything seemed K. O. until
“Shad” Goodson, frosh captain last fall, de-
cided to enjoy the peace and quiet-of Lincoln-
ton instead of another year at Davidson.
Monk will have to fill his shoes, It is hard
to say where that quarter is coming froth.
The coaches would give a lot to know the
answer to this riddle.
