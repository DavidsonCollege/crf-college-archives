Renovate The IFC?
Vote Slated Monday

A semi-formal dance will lead off the Spring Frolics
activities Friday night, April 27. Final contracting of
entertainers for the final dance weekend of the year has

not yet been completed.
“The IFC is’ not knuckling
under to criticism of the in-
formal Midwinters dance,” IFC
president Bob Waugh said to-
day. “The figure at the semi-
formal Friday night dance of
Spring Frolics will be an oppor-
tunity to present the new IFC
and fraternity sweethearts.”

IFC WILL VOTE

The 12 IFC fraternity repre-
sentatives will vote in next Mon-
day night’s meeting on the re-
visions to the IFC constitution
discussed by Waugh in assembly
last Monday morning. A %4
majority of the representatives ,
can effect the changes, whose
basic purpose as stated by
Waugh is “to show the faculty
that we are willing and capable
of self-control.”

The revisions were discussed
in individual fraternity chapter
meetings last night. One revis-
ion would give each of the fra-
ternity presidents a non-voting
advisory seat on the IFC, with
voting rights in the absence of
his fraternity’s representative.
A second will designate the IFC
as the sole interfraternity body
with the purpose of liaison be-
tween the administration and}
the fraternities. A final change
will require reporting of all

IFC judicial action to the Fra-
ternity Liaison Officer in the
administration.

IFC NEWSLETTER SOON

An IFC newsletter will be
published around April 14.
Johnny Rogers will edit the
newsletter, copies f which will
be sent to members of the Board
of Trustees, the faculty, the ad-
ministration, and each of the
alumni. The newsletter will in-
clude a statement by each fra-
ternity covering some phase of
its activities during the year.
Approximately 5,000 copies will
be published.

Debaters
Place 4th
At Contest

With eight wins and six de-
feats, the varsity debate team
tied for fourth place in a field
of 12 teams at the 29th annual
South Atlantic Forensic Tourna-
ment at Lenoir-Rhyne College
last weekend.

The squad, composed of Bill
Brown, Harry Daniel, Skip
Jones, Bob Liewellyn, ‘Tom
Poston and Doug Wilkerson,
defeated Navy, Duke, Carson-
Newman and High Point once
and Lenoir-Rhyne and Wil.
liam and Mary twice. Lenoir-
Rhyne won the tournament
and Navy was second.

Tom Abernathy, Ed Postian,
Bill Rule and Conrad Shumadine
left today to compete in the
eighth annual Spring Novice
Tournament at the University
of Pittsburgh.

Jones, Shumadine and Wil
kerson will participate in the
Smokey Mountain Forensic
tournament at Maryville College
in Maryville, Tennessee March
23-24.

Brown, Jones, Llewellyn, and
Poston, varsity debaters, have
been issued bids to Tau Kappa
Alpha, Honorary Forensic So-
ciety. The four have participated
in tournaments at Wake Forest,
Appalachian State Teachers Col-
lege, Duke and Lenoir-Rhyne.

Initiation will take place at
an annual banquet in early May
and will be headed by Dr. Joe
Wetherby of the Duke Univer-
sity English department. Weth-
erby is the Regional Governor
of TKA.

With this initiation, the
Davidson chapter will become
officially reactivated after
three years of paper exist-
ence. Requirements for initia-
tion include three semesters
of inter-collegiate debate and
a class standing in the upper
35 per cent.

TKA has 100 ° chapters
throughout the nation. Twenty-
one belong in the southern re-
gion, among them Duke, Ala-
bama, Mississippi, Tennessee,
William and Mary, L.S.U., Mia-
mi, Florida, Florida State and

Birmingham Southern.

The Publications Board
has announced David Dil-
lard and Bill Hagen as its
nominees for editor of THE
DAVIDSONIAN for 1962-63.
The candidates’ platforms
appear elsewhere on this
page.

Dillard, a French major, has
been secretary of Eumenean Lit-
erary Society, is in the Male
Chorus and is a C. R. Harding
Scholar. He was editor of his
high school newspaper and as
a freshman and sophomore was
a news and feature reporter for
THE DAVIDSONIAN.

An English major, Hagen is
presently a managing editor of
the campus newspaper. He thas
previously served as assign-
ments editor and was on the
swimming team for two years.
He is a member of Pi Kappa Phi
Social fraternity.

VOTE MONDAY

The election for the. editor
ship is scheduled for Monday
A possible change in the sched
ule may be effected by the
Student Council.

The council has met three
times this past week to discuss
the question of nominating and
voting procedures for publica-
tions heads. The problem arose
when some. students attempted
to place a third candidate in

nomination for the newspaper
post.
Previously, the Publications

Board, which is constitutionally
empowered to determine all
nominations for editorships, had
considered the individual in
question and declined to place
him before the student body as
a nominee. The board approves
or rejects nominations for the
various publications’ editors
after discussion of the qualifica-
tions of the individuals.
COUNCIL DEBATES

The council is now debating
the constitutional issues involv-
ed in response to a request to
allow write-in candidates, which
have previously been illegal.
When the student body ap
proved a new constitution last
year, it gave the Publications
Board its own constitution, as
it also did the YMCA. Both
groups were to have sole de-
termination of nominations in
their areas.

All editorial nominations must
have the approval of the Board,

which is composed of the editors

PAYS TUITION PLUS

About 70 Woodrow Wilson
Fellowships were granted in
Davidson's region which in-
cludes coastal states from North
Carolina to Delaware. Davidson
had the most winners of any
college in the region. Duke Uni-
versity placed first with 11 win-
ners, University of North Caro-
lina second, University of Vir-
ginia third, and Davidson fourth.
Last year eight Davidsonians
won Woodrow Wilson Fellow-
ships.

These fellowships pay com-
plete tuition and $1,500 extra
expenses for one year of grad-
uate study anywhere in the U.S.
or Canada. One requirement is
that candidates must consider
seriously college teaching as a
profession. Over 1,000 of these
fellowships are awarded yearly.

Dillard Asks Support
For New Objectivity

I want New Objectivity in THE DAVIDSONIAN—a
new fairness, a new honesty in approaching complex
“issues.” The fiftieth anniversary year seems a good time
for a return to conscious inte

lism.

Admittedly it is human nature
for a college paper to get car-
ried away with its pet peeves,
to become blind to the import-
ance of existing public opinion,
to be exclusively concerned
with what's wrong, never with
what may be right

But a responsibly edited DAV-
IDSONIAN should be able to
transcend its own bias—at least
most of the time. Here are sev
eral particular proposals aim
ed at fostering a new objectivity
in THE DAVIDSONIAN

| want to get “editorializ-
ing” out of the news stories.
This is a basic rule of any
honest journalism—present
facts as facts even if they do
not reinforce what's on the
editorial page. if THE DAV.
IDSONIAN is to be more -than
a one-sided piece of yellow
pressmanship it cannot ignore
the majority or minority
voices of dissent on campus—
editorializing must move back
to the editorial page.

I want to re-instate a week-to-
week column on the editorial
page—preferably by
not on the

social, economic, and political

differences. Give the space one

next to a “liberal,”’ and finally
to a moderate who might agree
with neither viewpoint or with
particulars of both.

I want to resurrect the feature
story from the janitor’s closet
and mud. There are other equal-
ly important personalities and
phenomena on campus and com-
ing to it. Notice the visits last
week of John Wotlinger, chair-
men of the American commit-
tee on Fulbright grants for
study abroad, and of Jean Lan-
glais, the internationally influ-
ential organist and composer.
Such subjects as these are
worth the best efforts of our
feature writers.

Regarding an editorial bias
on political questions, my
position would properly be
called “moderate.” Briefly |
would define the state as a
living organism which grows
by evolution—not revolution.

Reform to meet new needs is |

Union Sends T We
To Ping-Pong Meet

Ben Cole, College Union presi-
dent, announced this week that
Staff Warren and Keith Fraser
will represent Davidson at the
District Ping Pong Tournament
at Raleigh next week.

Cole also announced that}
Steve Arthur and Charlie Shap- |
pard will represent Davidson at
a planning session for the an-
nual Regional Convention of
College Unions. The planning
committee will meet at Women’s
College on March 17.

The Union hopes to get the

News articles, the interpretive
study, and editorials must have
both quality and appeal for the
Paper to have any “voice” to
and for the campus.

This should not be construed
to mean, however, that editor-
ials should be a mere reflection
of the majority in student opin-
ion. I firmly believe that the
editor has a delegate’s function:

that of serving the interests
that elected him in ways he
thinks best. Responsibility is
owed to the students, adminis.

tration, and personal integrity.

One broad but concrete
measure | would continually
strive for, as editor, would be
putting more individual re.
sponsibility in the hands of
the students. An increased
role for student opinion and
influence on campus will be
‘ene of the most important
ways to break the “apathy
barrier.”

In this respect, 1 would be
wholeheartedly behind any ef-
forts of the Student Council to
represent student views more
effectively to the administra-
tion. If the caliber of student
entering Davidson is continually
going up, I see no reason for
not increasing the influence of
both the individual and the
group in deciding those policies
relating directly to the student
body.

Although it would be impos-
sible to predict what my stand
would be on problems arising in
the future, I can say that I will
try to the utmost to examine
each situation and its attend-
ant circumstances objectively
and intelligently. Certain speci-
fic proposals I will ‘support,
| though, are;

1,—an increasing use of the
second page as a sounding
board for student opinion and
| as a source of new ideas. Lead-
| ers in student activities will be
| urged to exercise their right to

| for a closer communication with
the individual student. Also a
monthly column of activities

French Depariment
Revises Courses

A new intensive basic French
course, an advanced course
which will emphasize both
French literature and fluency
improvement, and an increased
emphasis on seminars and tutor-
ials for the most advanced
courses are three major changes
in next year’s French curricu-
lum.

French 13-14, which will in-
clude the content of both the
present 11-12 and 21-22 courses,
will be offered in addition to
the basic courses now given.
It is primarily designed for up-
perclassmen with extensive ex-
perience in another foreign
language; only a few freshmen
will be admitted. Juniors and
seniors will no longer be allow-
ed to take 11-12. The French de-
partment feels that the pace of
the elementary course is too
slow for students who have al-
ready learned another language.

French 33-34 will include lit-
erature as does the present 31-
32, but it will also stress work
on composition and conversa-
tion.

The most advanced courses,
dealing with periods of French
literature, will cease to be
taught as classes. They will be
offered instead as seminar of
tutorial courses, on

controversial foreign film.
