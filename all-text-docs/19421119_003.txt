Lacy shot past the safety man to take it in and scoré for the

Chicago Gears rolled ovér Green Bay, 38-7, to win their 21st
game in a row. Don Hutson, Packer end, snared his’ 14th
TD pass of the season and kieked—the point to bring his
point total to 110 in eight games

At this time we would like to put into print an appreciation
of Ben Lacy, six times game captain, who snapped his leg Fri
day. Ben played the type ball that all of us love to watech—hard
and clean all the way. Never say die even if the score is 40-0
against you, that was the way his playing looked to us.

Things To Come

Out onthe proverbial limb we go as we can’t resist trying
our luck with reference tO predicting Saturday’s games. Hold
on to your hats, for here goes: Alabama in an easy win over
Vandy, Duke by a touchdown with State, Georgia and Georgia
Tech will win handily over Auburn and Florida. Now a couple
of upsets—Furman’s nineteen men will beat Clemson, Kentucky
will take the Vols from Tennessee, and North Carolina’s Pre-
Flighters may take William & Mary.-Two toughies—Notre
Dame over Northwestern by a hair, then Ohio State and Michi
gan_will_be_very-close-but-we'H-butter-the-State side. Lastly
Davidson will win in a mild upset over Citadel. :
