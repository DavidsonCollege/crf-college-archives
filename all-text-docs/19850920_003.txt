Ratliff; One Of The Ten Best Professors In Nation

By JEFF LESESNE

Charles Ratliff, Davidson’s
Kenan Professor of Economics,
finished in the top ten in the 1985
Professor of the Year contest held
by the Council for Advancement
and Support of Education
(CASE).

Ratliff, one of nine runner-
ups, received the Gold Medalion
award. He was selected from 256
nominies by a jury chaired. by Er-
nest Boyer, president of the Car-
negie Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Teaching. The jury
relied mainly on ‘etters from
former students in making its de-
cision. ,

Boyer noted, “I am confident
that there’s no better way of ensur-
ing excellence in schools and col-
leges than recognizing and re-
warding outstanding teachers.”
He continued, “When we single
out gifted teachers for special rec-
ognition, we send a powerful and
important message that teaching
in America counts.”

About the award, Ratliff said,
“It was embarassing to get singled
out. It seems the award goes to the
College, not to a single indi-
vidual.” He said, “I represent
other teachers in the profession.”

The whole event was a sur-
prise to Ratliff. He had no idea
that he had been nominated. Rat-
liff said, “I was tipped off when
someone congratulated me in the
hall.” He then read about the com-

‘petition in the libraty‘in anewspa-- °

According to Ratliff, “One of

Willingham Becomes First

By ANDREA DIEDRICH

Carol Connor Willingham, a
member of Davidson’s first class
to break the all-male tradition, has
broken another tradition here. She
was elected the first woman presi-
dent of the Davidson College
Alumni Association in their sum-
mer balloting.

Willingham, a 29-year-old
Raleigh stockbroker is also the
youngest person ever to hold the
office. Jamie May, alumni direc-
tor, believes that her youth may
have an even greater impact than
her sex. He said, “While she will
certainly be sensitive to all the
alumni, her age will have a great
appeal to recent graduates.”

Willingham herself does not

dents, like some from 30 years
ago.”
Ratliff added: “My greatest
satisfaction [as a teacher] comes
from seeing someone light up as
the meaning of something I’m
explaining becomes clear. My
time in the classroom is the high
spot of my day.”

. Ratliff came to Davidson as a
freshman in 1943. After two years
here he went into the Navy during

“WWII. Hé was irrthe supply corps

and the Navy sent him to Chapel
Hill and Harvard Business School
to take accounting courses. Ratliff
said, “During that time I spent five

believe that her sex will have a
very strong effect on her plans as
president. “I don’t see the position
as enormously related to gender,
and I don’t see any great new
causes that I’m going to be sup-
porting just because I’m a
woman,” she said. She does plan
to utilize her perspective as a
woman in issues that face the Col-
lege.

Willingham will serve as pres-
ident-elect during the 1985-1986
year while William Davis serves
as president. As president in the
1986-1987 year she will head the
alumni association’s board of di-
rectors. She will also sit on the
college’s board of trustees for

hours a day in class.” Ratliff re-
turned to Davidson and was able
to graduate on time in 1947.

Ratliff was asked by the late
Dr. C.K. Brown to remain at
Davidson as an accounting in-
structor for. the following year.
Ratliff felt it would be good ex-
perience, so he accepted. The fol-
lowing year Brown made him as-
sistant professor of economics.” I
never intended to be a professor,”
Ratliff said. “I thought I’d go into
business, but during my second
year here the teaching bug bit
me.”

Ratliff left Davidson in 1949-

1951 to earn his master’s degree,
and in 1953-1954 to obtain his
doctoral degree, both from Duke
University.

From 1963-1966 Ratliff went
to Lahore, Pakistan to set up an
economics graduate program at
Forman Christian College. He
was with the United Methodist
Board of Global Ministries. He re-
turned to teach in Pakistan in
1969-1970.

Ratliff has also served as a vis-
iting professor at UNC at Char-
lotte; Appalachian State Univer-
sity, Boone, NC; University of the
Punjab and Kinnaird College,

both in Lahore, Pakistan.

Ratliff has received numerous
other awards for his teaching abil-
ities. He was named Outstanding
Educator in America in 1971. He
also received the Alumni Appreci-
ation Award from Davidson in
1970, and in 1972 he received the
Thomas Jefferson Award at
Davidson. This award recognizes
the faculty member who gives of
himself beyond the call of duty. In
1977 he was named Kenan Profes-
sor of Economics, an honor recog-
nizing teaching ability.

Ratliff has been the author of
several publications including /n-
terstate Apportionment of Busi-

mess Income for State Income Tax

Purposes.

Ratliff is also active in the
Democratic Party of Mecklenburg
County and the Methodist
Church. He serves on the national
board of directors for the Rural
Advancement Fund/National
Sharecroppers Fund. He also di-
rected Bread for the World in
1983-84.

Ratliff is also a member of the
National Tax Association, South-
ern Economic Association, Amer-
ican Economic Association, As-
sociation for Asian Studies,
Southern Finance Association,
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors, American Coun-
cil for the United Nations Univer-
sity, Fulbright Alumni Associa-
tion, Phi Beta Kappa, and Omic-
ron Delta Kappa.

Ratliff is married to the former
Mary Virginia Heilig and has
three children.

Woman President Of Alumni

both years.

May sees Willingham’s en-
thusiasm about Davidson as one
of her strongest assets as presi-
dent-elect of the alumni associa-
tion. “Her proven record of
alumni service was key to her
election,” he said. “All the candi-
dates were outstanding.”

She has served as decade
chairman of alumni fund-raising,
and she is on the Davidson alumni
admissions program (DAAP) in
Raleigh.

Willingham was placed on the
ballot for election following her
nomination by the alumni body
and reviewied by the alumni board
of directors. Two other alumni
were on the ballot.

alumni voted. May was very posi-
tive about the turnout and com-
mented, “It’s the highest percen-
