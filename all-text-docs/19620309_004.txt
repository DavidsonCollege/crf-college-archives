THE THREE NOMINEES for editor of Quips and Cranks, Jim Norman, Ted Scarboro, and
Hal Todd, seem to have something weighing on their minds. It may be elections or this year’s
uncompleted issve lying before them, both of which will near a climax next week. (Staff Photo

Yearbook Candidates
Set Forth Their Views

A SUPERIOR ANNUAL in-
corporates a broad range of
items. The most important three
are (1) choosing the best per-
sonnel for each major position;
(2) making full use of all the
many varied talents on campus
—Photographers, writers, idéa
men, and artists; and (3) bud-
geting both time and money
correctly so that they can pro-
duce Davidson's finest Annual
in 1963. ;

COLOR is an excellent med-
ium for conveying the beauty of
our campus to those who see
the annual. Not only in several
large color pictures (without
painted-in clouds!), but also in
the use of color accents through-
out the book.

INDIVIDUAL PICTURES

INDIVIDUAL PICTURES re-
flect the personalities of the
students and also reflect the
composite personality of the
student body. In recent years,
many fraternities have found
that the individual pictures in
their composites have been bet-
ter than the annual pictures.
For this reason, I would like
to offer that company an op-
portunity to submit contracts on
the individual pictures for both
Quips and Cranks and the com-
Posites. This would allow the
annual to receive the benefit of
better pictures and the stud-
ents the chore of having to pose
only once and being assured of
a good picture.

PHOTOGRAPHY is the most

descriptive of the graphic arts.
Being a photographer enables
me to be able to see the many
varied uses of the camera and
also its limitations.

THE 1962 Quips, and Cranks
leaves a core of experienced
men to lead it toward higher
goals. Utilizing these men to
their utmost, adding to this
core with new talent: and. the
correct. budgeting of one’s as-
sets would permit the 1963
Quips and Cranks to be the best
ever!

Scarboro

The Quips and Cranks should
be a photo interpretation of the
year’s events, and. if elected to
the post of editor, I will en-
deavor to make it so. The editor
must formulate his idéas for the
whole yearbook as well as for
each of the individual parts.
Special techniques, which only
photography can achieve, prop-
erly used. will make a success-
ful yearbook. To be able. to
visualize an idea and carry it
out on film would. be a great
asset to any man. Having had
the experience of being the
chief photographer for this
year’s annual, I feel that I have,
fo some extent, gained this as-
set:

TEAM EFFORT

It would certainly not do to
attempt to make the yearbook
the product of a single man.
There is more work involved in
its preparation than any one

man could accomplish in a
year. The editor should do his
utmost to make the yearbook a
“team effort", selecting men for
this “team” who would be the
most highly qualified for their
particular assignment. Addition-
al men would also be needed to
formulate the overall theme,
planning, and coordination of
activities,

With my ability as a photo-
grapher, and with a carefully
selected staff, I would endeavor
to make next year’s annual a
book with several purposes. For
the Seniors the annual should
be a book which will give them
a lasting and interesting resume
of their years as Davidson stud-
ents. For the underclassmen the
annual should provide a full
cross section of college activi-
ties; a book which will be, in
every sense, a yearbook: a book
of activities of the past year.
For the general public the an-
nual should present a fair and
understandable interpretation
of Davidson College, its men
and its physical plant.

I stand as a nominee fully
knowing the magnitude .and re-
sponsibility of this position. 1
am willing to serve you, the
student body, to the utmost of
my capacity, and I should con-
sider it an honor to do so.

Todd |

The college yearbook, in its
fullest sense, should be both an
embodiment, of the school and
the students it represents, and
a full record of the senior class
that produces it.

CONTINUITY

This can be accomplished
best by the use of pictures hav-
ing such a degree of personal
attractiveness so as to tell the
Story of the book almost within
themselves, supplemented by
well-written copy to make it
complete.

The yearbook should also
have a continuity that makes it
a complete unit. This can be
achieved by use of a theme that
is carried throughout the book,
without becoming trite, and al-
so by using an enlarged color
section and a oolor scheme
through the entire annual.

LESS FORMAL

In increasing the quality of
each section by using pictures
that are less formal and there-
fore better examples of the ac-
tivities they represent, the book
will come closer to its goal of

showing the school and_ the |

school year as it is seen by the
student body. These are my ob-
jectives,

If given the privilege of edit:
ing the Quips and Cranks for
next year, I intend to carry them
out by use of a well organized
staff and a more complete use
of good photography through.
out to make it an annual that
will represent the school and
the senior class in the ‘best way
possible.

In Organization Attempt

Approximately 20 people were on hand Wednesday night as the newly-organized

BY TOM LOFLIN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Conservative Club held its second meeting in the Green Room of the College Union.
The club obtained a temporary name, “Conservative Club,” a temporary president,
Clay Atkins, and adopted a set of purposes for the organization.

Atkins, who was elected
Chairman of the Activities
Committee at the first meet-
ing, announced that at 5 p.m.
next Monday he would hold a
discussion on Viet-Nam.

Prof. James Martin of the
Chemistry Department, the ad-
viser for the club, made a brief
statement at the beginning of
the meeting in which he sought
to correct some false ideas a-
bout the organization.

Professor Martin said, “We
want to correct the public
image of conservatism on this
campus. To do this, | suggest
we have a committee set up
to take various ideas from
magazines such as The Re-
porter, The Nation, and Ne
tional Review and present a
mimeographed sheet each
month with both sides of per-
tinent questions. In this way,
t believe we can get people
to read our ideas and to see
that we are open-minded.”

No action was taken at the
meeting on, Martin’s suggestion,
but he said that he felt sure
that it would be carried through
since there had been some dis-
cussion on the matter at the
first mecting. Martin also told
THE DAVIDSONIAN that most
of the professors he knew were
very much in favor of an organ-
ization of the conservative type
getting started at Davidson.

“Whether they are conserva-
tive
orgaiization of this type will
start enough peopie to thinking
and that sooner or later stud-
ents will swing to their views,”
he said.

Tom Ross presided at Wednes- ,

day night's meeting. The major-
ity of the time was spent in
adopting five purposes and five
basic understandings of the or-
ganization. The summary of the
purposes was presented in the
fifth point of the preamble to
an as-of-yet unwritten constitu-
tion. »¢

It stated that: “The purpose
of this organization shall be to

‘promote an active program that

will complement the guiding
purposes of this organization.”
This would presumably in-

elude arranging for conserva-
tive speakers to visit the
campus and for the distribut-
ing of the sheet which Pro-
fessor Martin proposed.

The five basic understandings
of the organization are as fol-
lows in part: Man should be free
from any forces which would
deny him his “basic right” of
freedom of choice; the major
purpose of government should
be“... the protection of, rath-
er than infringement upon, the
personal freedoms of the gov-
erned; . .. the burden of gov-
ernment should not fall to a
macro-centralized bureaucracy,
but to free citizens accepting
individual responsibility in
areas of local influence; ... a
market economy free from. un-

due government restraint is the
only system that is both the
best supplier of human needs
and an adequate protector of
personal freedom; and... the
foreign policy of these United
States should be characterized
by a more positive assertion of
our national aims.”

He also indicated that in
the near future Dr. D. M.
Sparrow from Chariotte would
speak to the club on the AMA
stand on medical aid to the
aged.

The next official meeting for
the Conservative Club will be
held next Wednesday at 7 p.m.
As yet no meeting site has been
selected. Atkins urged all peo-
ple interested in joining the
club to attend.

is required.

The fellowship is for a one-
year trial period during which
the student seeks to determine
his fitness for the ordained
Christian ministry. Cooley chose
Union from a list of 82 accredit-
ed theological seminaries be-
cause of its “quality, broad cur.
riculum, rigorous academic
Standards and cultural advan-
tages.”

Cooley, a Sigma Chi from
Black Mountain, N. C., recent-
ly returned from a four-month
tour of the East where he at-
tended an educational work
camp for two weeks in West
Pakistan and the Third As-
sembly of the World Council
of Churches in New Delhi.

He also visited the Madras
Boys’ Town in South India to
which the Davidson YMCA gift
fund went last year and attend
ed youth conferences in the
Philippines. In addition, he
traveled through most of the
Middle East, Taiwan, Japan and
Hawaii.

WEEJUN-DEVOURING SLUSH — Greeks have been half-
wading half-walking through not-so-firm terra firma to houses
located on the northern end of the court.

College Authorities Silent

As Students

Sink Jn Goo

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonien Feature Writer
Way back in high school they taught us that the
shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
At the moment, the feasibility of such movement between
Richardson Dormitory and the northern section of Pat- .
terson Fraternity Court is extremely questionable.

Hawthorne said, “Life is made

;up of marble and mud.” And

while we may lack the marble
half of reality, there is certain-
ly no shortage of the other
factor. To the contrary, the un-
wary Davidson gentleman, ever
conscious of labor-saving short-
cuts, is liable to suddenly dis-
cover that the alternate trans-
court path has disappeared into
a sea of slogging muck.

it seems that terra firma
has given way somewhat to

: the periodic winter monsoons

of snow, sleet, and rain, and
the food-ward tramp of hund-
reds of feet has created
quite a quagmire. And the
spring thaws do not promise
any improvement in the wee-
jun-devouring slush.

And while careless feet ooze
in the mud and erosion creates
an alluvial fan from the driving
range to the Sigma Chi house.
the main walk itself is occasion-
ally traced with rivulets and un-
dermined with deceptive sink
holes. Even the most securely
combat-boot shod foot is lost in
the soup.

And what improvements have
been suggested for Davidson's
caldron of mud? Some suggest
enroliment in the soil bank
program. Conservatives favor a
more. hardy strain of grass. And .
quite legitimate compared with
the monorail idea is the great
asphalt paving lobby.

The college authoritie: are
silent about the whole matter;
why should a little impedi-
ment such as mud stop the
student body when it failed to
even slow the army (on the
evidence of ROTC).

But suppose all schemes fail
and the Hill continues its ob-
livion to the mud wallow in the
Greek back yard, what happens
when April showers have turned
all paths into obstacle courses?
How many spike heels will dis-
appear into the goo before ac-
tion is taken? Shal! memories of
Spring Frolics consist only of
battles with demonic ground
conditions? ,

The time for action is now,
before the mud pits suck down
to thick oblivion the careless
student. Or we should at least
have some more marble.
