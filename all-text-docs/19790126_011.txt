work. Abbott hopes to explore
questions such as how a biogra-

sequence of survey courses,
according to Abbott. In addi-

tion to establishing 495, the ©

department has rearranged the
sequence of courses which are
prerequisites for 495. Majors
will be required to take at least
three survey courses before 495.
The department feels this will
help students build a broad,
cohesive knowledge of litera-
ture. During the transition be-
tween the old system and the
new, the requirements for the
class of 1980 will be altered. The
class of 1980 will have the

Kehs continued, “Regarding
a student station, I feel that
those interested in radio should
have opportunities to learn from
working on it. Now there aren’t
enough places for those inte-
rested in radio and a carrier
current station run by students
might fill that need. Personally,
I don’t have the time to work on
another station.”

But WDAV seems to be

Director to establish a regular

option of taking either the old
courses 399 and 499, or the new
course 495 plus one elective.
This elective will make up for
losses in the transition, The
class of 1981 will be the first
class to take 495 and its
prerequisites in sequence.

Cole and Abbott both feel
that the involvement of all the
majors with all the professors
will be interesting and enri-
ching. Under the present pro-
gram, many majors graduate
without having had all the
professors.

All the professors agreed on
the design of the course, accor-
ding to Cole. They do not see
any major disadvantage to 495.
Cole said that all the students
and professors cannot be
matched in independent study.

The new course seems to
appeal to students as well.
Junior English major Leslie
Miller said she likes 495 and
thinks that it will be a “big

SGA President Bruce Brown
hopes to organize a greup to
investigate all the options and
possible interest. ‘It’s hard to
get people interested in a vague
wish or possibility,’’ said
Brown. ‘‘We’re still not sure of
what DAV will be ‘offering to
students and consequently how
much need there is for a new
station.’”

Payne feels that many crea-
tive interests of students could
be fulfilled during the 10 pm to

scholarships to Davidson.

For the first time, the semi-finalists have been invited to come to
Davidson for their interviews, with the aim of exposing them to
Davidson so that they may choose this school even if they don’t

win the scholarship.

They are scheduled to visit campus on,Friday and Saturday,

February 9 and 10,

each having two interviews on Saturday.

Sixteen of them will be invited to come back in March for final

change in the way people look at
comprehensive finals.”’

Junior English major Jane
Saunders believes that with
495, ‘‘students will be less
afraid of comprehensive finals.”

Sophomore Charles Lemmon,
a prospective English major,
likes the idea of having all the
professors teach the course,
since they all have varying
viewpoints.

Proposed by a committee
consisting of Dr. L. R. King,
Dr. Benjamin G. Klein, and Dr.
J. B. Stroud, the Math curricu-
lum changes are central to the
departments effort to increase
the breadth of applied mathe-
matics offered at Davidson.
Courses in mathematical mode-
ling (Math 120), computer
science (Math 125), advanced
statistics (Math 149), and ab-
stract mathematics (Math 100)
have been instituted as part of
this effort. r

’ commented that ‘‘the new curri-

pli¢ation of mathematics as well
as increased use and study of
the computer.”

Moreover, the new curricu-
lum will raise the basic calculus
requirement of Math 25 and 26
to include Math 27, an intro-
ductory course in linear algebra,
matrices, and multivariate cal-
culus. Prerequisite to any upper
level course, Math 27 will be
offered in the spring for the first
time and will be comparable to
Math 26 in difficulty.

Jackson described Math 27 as
“essentially a combination of
the introductory aspects of
Math 132 and Math 137’ and
noted that Math 27 as well as
Math 26 will be credited toward
the mathematics major.

Another new course, Math
120 (Mathematical Modeling),
