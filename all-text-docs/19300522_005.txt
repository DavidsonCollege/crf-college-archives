THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 22, 1930

Duke Devils Blank
Wildcat Nine, 7-0

Kugler’s Great Hurling Ruined by

Teammates’ Errors

Playing wide-awake and errorless baseball
behind the superb pitching of Tim Mc-
Keithan, elongated sophomore hurler, the
Duke University Blue Devils reversed the
tables on the Davidson College Wildcats and
walked away with a 7 ‘to 0 victory. Mc-
Keithan surrendered but three hits and had
the Cats ‘at his mercy at all times.

On the other hand, Captain Doc Kugler
probably pitched the best game of his career,
but miserable support, poor judgment, and
several bone-head plays marred what would
have otherwise been a great mound duel.

The hard-hitting Blue Devils, five of
whom have recently signed’ contracts with
the big leagues, obtained only six bingles
from the offerings of Kugler, two of which
were scratches. He also bested the Duke
hurler in the strikeout route, five to three.
However, the Davidson infield was in ter-
rible form, making, seven of the eight errors
credited against the ’Cats, and in that lay
the cause of defeat. y

SENIOR GIFT

(Continued from page 1)
The gift this year is. very appropriate as it
completes the furnishings for the stage.

The cyclorama and valance was first
viewed by the student body on last Monday
at chapel. Dr. Walter Lingle, President of
Davidson, expressed his appreciation of the
gift at that time. It will be officially pre-
sented to Davidson College at the gradua-
tion exercises in June, by W. B. McGuire,
President of the Senior Class. It will be ac-
cepted on behalf of the college by Dr. Lingle.

This gift was selected by the Class Gift
Committee after some deliberation. This com-
mittee included R. B. Erckman, chairman;
W. F. Gaffney, F. R. Brown, F. W. John-
ston, and W. G. McGavock.

clude Wednesday, June 4. The academic pro-

cession will form at 10 a. m. and at 10:30
o'clock the actual exercises begin. Included

torian and valedictorian of the class, presen-
tation of additional curtains for the audi-
torium stage as the class gift, and the award-
ing of second lieutenant commissions to ad-
vanced R. O. T. C. students, and college
diplomas to 104 seniors.

Invitations were mailed out this week to
the entire alumni body, inviting them to the

during the past montlis to get the members
of eleven classes to return for special re-
unions. ‘The alumni will have a predominat-
ing part--in the program Tuesday, and the
class dihners that evening, preceding a dra:
matic «club -presentation, wilt be the high-
light of their activity.

Cats Drop Another
Game to N. Carolina

Homerun With Bases :Full is
Feature of Game

The University of North Carolina nine
took the Wildcats into camp for the second
time this season when they won on their
home diamond, ‘8-3. Cecil Longest was able
to keep the eight safe blows of the ‘Cats
well scattered, whereas McInnis was wild
from the start. Billy Brown was undoubt-
edly the feature of the game, for in the
fifth inning he broke a 1-1 tie by smacking
a long homer to center field with the bases
filled. Besides his homer, he garnered a sin-
gle and a double out of four attempts.

The Wildcat pitcher strove hard to even
up for his wildness, and got two hits out
of three trials. He scored two of the ’Cats’
three runs, one coming from a home run.
Goodson and Parrish also got two safe
knocks. The latter also added another triple
to his long string of three-baggers.

Box score and summary:

Pepper Leads Golf

Team Next Season

Jack Pepper, Jr., of Winston-Salem, has
been elected captain and manager of the Da-
vidson College golf team for the session
1930-31. This is the second successive year
that Pepper has piloted the ’Cat golfers, both
as manager and as captain. With several good
offerings from the Freshman Class, the Da-
vidson team next year will be much stronger
than the past season.

Pepper was one of the mainstays on the
Davidson foursome this spring. He is the
champion individual golfer of North Caro-
lina golfers, having been the low medalist
in the state meet at Greensboro when the
tourney was staged on the Sedgefield course
there the latter part of April.

Cop—Don't ever let me catch you speed-
ing again.

Speeder—You won't, ‘officer. Tomorrow I
get my new racing car.

Handbook Dedicated
To Mr. F. L. Jackson

The “Wildcat Handbook” for 1930 will be
dedicated to F. L. Jackson, treasurer of the
college, according to an announcement re-
cently made by Paul Alderman, editor. There
will be 800 copies printed this year, and the
freshmen will receive theirs at least by Au-
gust 5. The upperclassmen may obtain their
copies upon their arriving at school next

fall.

On the whole, the Handbook will be es-
sentially the same as it was last year, with
the exception of a little different cover de-
sign. One new feature will be intramural
sports. On account of an addition to the num-
bers of cuts and advertisements, there will
be twelve or fifteen more pages this year.

Beta Theta Pi Wins
Finals in Baseball

In the finals of the inter-fraternity base-
ball tournament, Beta Theta Pi won from Pi
Kappa Phi by the score of 6-5. Johnston,
pitching for the’ Betas, held the Pi Kappa
Phis scoreless until the fifth inning when
they staged a rally and scored several runs,
but barely fell short of the mark.

In previous games the Betas defeated the
S. P. E.’s,.A. O.’s and K. A.’s, Johnston
and Beacham were the usual battery ex;
cept in the game with the Alpha Omegas,
in which Ballard occupied the mound. To
reach the finals the Pi Kappa Phis defeated
the Kappa Sigs, 5-4.

He—Have you made up your mind to
stay in?

She—No, I have made up my face to go
out. \

...in a cigarette It’s

GETTING DOWN to brass tacks, a cigarette
is a smoke — made and bought for your own

enjoyment.

But between just something to smoke, and
tobacco character, richness, delicate aroma—
in short, something to faste—well, that’s the
difference that accounts for Chesterfield’s ever-

mounting popularity—
