BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE

Some Satisfied, Some Not

With Faculty Oath Change

BY TOM LOFLIN

As is to be expected after
any controversial action,
Davidson’s officials and
faculty members had differ-
ent reactions Wednesday
after the Trustee compro-
mise on the faculty oath
issue.

There were two general at-
titudes expressed about the
compromise: satisfaction, and
deep feeling of disappointment
by some that the entire idea
of a professorial oath at Dav-
idson was not scrapped en-
tirely.

President D. G. Martin felt
that the new oath would
strengthen Davidson's Christian
commitment. ‘‘The new Trustee
ruling advances the date of some
professors’ commitment as
much as five to twenty years,"’
Martin said. ‘‘It will assure the

fact that a large majority rath-
er than a minority of the Fac-
ulty will be thus commissioned
(will have taken a vow).”
Martin explained that in the
past only full professors were
required to take an oath and
that men often remained on the
faculty as long as twenty years
without becoming full professors.

Dr. J. McDowell Richards,
Chairman of the Board of
Trustees, also expressed satis-
faction with the new oath. He
felt that it was an improvement
over the old one, “The Trustees
by their action made clear that
Davidson College is to remain
a Christian institution. At the
same time, the Trustees rec-
ognized that the method of
securing the achievement of this
objective could be improved,"
Richards said.

leaders of a faculty committee

Measles Epidemic
At Saturation Stage

BY BUCK LAWRIMORE

“Davidson is now experienc
ing about as much of an epi
demic of this kind of measles
as it could,” Dr. J. B. Woods
said this week. “‘Probably as
much as four-fifths of the boys
have already had them in child-
hood, and are therefore immune.
As far as I know you can have
these German, or three-day,
measles (scientific name: rubel
la) only once."

Symptoms of the disease, he
said, are itching of the skin and
possible temperature, accom-
panied by swollen lymph nodes
in the neck.

They are most contagious
around the time when they are
breaking out in a red rash, but |
usually by the time the little/
bumps are shining, the victim}
has had contact with a large
number of people to which he
could have spread them. From}
infection to recovery usually
takes about three days.

Woods estimated that in the
past two weeks there have been '
some 50-75 cases on campus, |
some of which have surely not}
been reported to the infirmary. |/
That no more cases have oc-
curred despite the contagious-
ness of the disease is ample evi-
dence that most students have
already had the illness, Woods
feels.

Only those with irritating
symptoms like fever or sore |
throats have been kept in the |
infirmary. All the other itchers |
have been allowed to run loose,
although the doctor advises

the Infected Ones or fear to
contract them now. |

“The older you get the more
serious the effects," Dr. Woods |
noted. ‘‘The disease is especially |
dangerous to contract during
pregnancy. Since they are not |
so contagious as red measles, |
many women do not catch them}
until adulthood. If contracted
during pregnancy, especially the
first three months, the child may
be deformed or handicapped, al
though many babies are born
perfectly healthy under = such
conditions. Measles are not
nearly so damaging as thali-
domyde, Woods added.

set up to recommend abolition
of Davidson's oath, expressed
satisfaction at the compro-
mise. Rhodes did not know of
the Trustees action when
reached at his home Wednes-
day night, but he said upon
learning of the new vow rul-
ing, “I think that this is a
meaningful change.”

Rhodes liked two things in
particular about the new oath:
“I think that it is a simple and
much more straightforward type
of vow. I like the idea of having
it administered during a special
religious ceremony before those
people who want to attend. I
think the ceremony will be more
meaningful than the old cere-
mony at graduation.”

Rhodes said that he did not
anticipate any more action from
his committee in the future and
said that he thought faculty
feelings on the matter will be
improved by the new vow.

Dr. E. F. Patterson did not
agree with the new vow ruling.
“Any kind of a vow required of
professors at an institution of
higher learning is inconsistent
with teaching at this level," he
said, ‘I believe that this new
vow hurts worse than the old
one simply because it includes
more people." ;

Dr. J. H. Ostwalt, who re-
fused to become a full profes-
sor about ten years ago be-
cause of his convictions
against any kind of an oath,
said that he did not think the
situation has been materially
improved with the new vow.

“I think any requirement like
an oath will prevent the college
from getting many outstanding
men to teach here. The expan
sion of the new oath to include
more members of the faculty
may even be a larger drawback
to recruiting professors than was
the old one,"’ Ostwalt added.

On Speakers Stand

The Board of Trustees in their meeting Wednesday

compromised between abolishing the faculty oath entirely |
the much-embattled old one. The result is|’
that the college has a new vow which will be given to all| }:

and keepi

faculty members upon their acquiring tenure.
In addition to changing the form of the vow, the

$1.5 million from the estate of the late Mrs. Walter H.

Woodson.

Watched President D. G. Martin receive an award
from the Department of the Army for “distinguished

civilian service.”

@ Approved leaves for next year for various faculty

members, and

@ Approved the hiring of several new faculty mem-

The results of the Trustees’
decision on the professorial oath
are that the vow will contain
two parts instead of the present
three, that the number of facul-
ty members who will have to
take the oath will be increased,
and that the time and place for
men taking the oath will be
changed.

The new vow contains the fol
lowing wording:

“1. Do you acknowledge Jesus
Christ as Lord and Saviour as
revealed in the Holy Scripture
and will you endeavor to live a
life consistent with this profes-
sion?

**2. Do you dedicate yourself to
the vocation of teaching and will
you seek faithfully to perform
the task of teacher, to inform
the minds of students and to
create in them a thirst for know-
ledge, a love of wisdom, and a
reverence for truth?"’

The old oath had three clauses
which were considered by many
to be open to many different in-
terpretations:

“a. Do you acknowledge Jesus
Christ as Lord and Savior and do
you believe in the fundamental
teachings of evangelical Chris
tianity?

‘tb. Do you believe the scrip
tures of the Old and New Testa
ment to be the word of God, the
only infallible rule of faith and
practice?

‘ec. Do you promise in the
humble reliance upon the grace
of God; which comes. by the
Holy Spirit, so to live and teach
as to give expression to the
Christian faith?”

Under the Trustee decision, all
professors who become eligible
for tenure (permanent status as
a member of the faculty) will
be required to take the new oath
in what the Trustees call “a
commissioning service." The
service will be held in the col
lege church during a meeting of
the Trustees; and the faculty,
students, and friends of the col-

lege will be permitted to attend.

Martin said that members of
the faculty who now have tenure
will not be required to take the
new vow until they become full
professors. “Men with tenure
will be given the choice of tak
ing the vow or not,"’ Martin said.
‘*‘But the vow will not be retro
active. They need not take the
new one.”

In the past, only men who
became full professors at Dav-
idson were required to take
the oath. The oath was admin-
istered to them during gradua-
tion ceremonies, a fact which
many professors have object-
ed to in the past.

In actual fact, the new oath
and procedure for its adminis-
tration are not yet official col-
lege policy. Changes in the By-
Laws by the Trustees must be
proposed at one regular meeting
so that they can be enacted in
the following meeting. The new
oath cannot be put into effect

until final approval by the
Trustees.
President Martin said, how

ever, “The proposal’ to change
the vow made by the Trustees
today is tantamount to their ap-
proval at the next meeting. It
is possible, of course, that some-
thing could come up so that they
might vote not to enact their
proposal at the next meeting.
But I would say that would be
highly improbable. When decid
ing on the proposal for changing
the vow today, there was not one
dissenting vote."

The Trustees, in proposing a
new vow, charged the President

of the college or the Dean of|
Faculty to make sure of the}
Christian commitment of all
prospective members of the)

faculty and to discuss the pur
pose of the college with them,
making sure that they are in
basic agreement with the pur
pose.

The Trustee action on the
oath ceme from the recom-
mendation of its Education
Committee which has been
studying the matter for the
past eight months. The com-
mittee worked with several
professors appointed by the
Faculty, which petitioned the
Trustees last year to review
Davidson's oath due to the
fact that many favored its
abolition.

Martin said that the question
of atheist Scriven was raised in
the meeting. ‘‘The Trustees ex-
pressed their confidence in the
action of the administration on
this matter."" He added “Their
confidence indicates we have a
board far beyond the average
one in its understanding of edu-
cation today.”

Mrs. Woodson, formerly of
Mocksville, set up a trust fund
for the college of $1.5 million,
the Trustees learned. Martin
said that income to the college
from the fund would be about
$60 thousand a year.

The award made to Martin
by Arthur T. Port, an assist-
ant secretary of the Army,
said in part:

Slater Slated For Re-inspection

Health Officer Calls
For Slater Clean-Up

BY TOM LOFLIN

A State Department of Health inspector looked over the college’s cafeteria Mon-
day and apparently would agree with last week’s DAVIDSONIAN report on the un-
sanitary conditions in the kitchen.

Inspector Noah Walters re
moved the health-grade_ notice
and advised Manager H, R. Bry
son to clean up the kitchen by
this afternoon, when he was
slated to re-inspect the kitchen
for a new grade.

By a phone call to Walters
Wednesday night, the - details
of the inspection were learned.
The call was made after THE
DAVIDSONIAN observed that
Bryson was not displaying his
health-grade notice (an ‘‘A”
rating).

Inspector Walters knew what
had happened to the notice. “I
was up there day-before-yester-
day (Monday) and checked the
place, and it didn't look too
good; so I took the sign down."

Walters then went on to tell
what he found wrong with the
cafeteria and what he hoped to
do about it. ‘‘I plan to come back
Friday afternoon to look over
the kitchen again and give the
place a new rating. I gave the
manager quite a check list of
what I found wrong during the
inspection. I am now giving him
a chance to clean it up.

“Bryson went around with
me during the inspection and

Joe Howell told THE DAVID

still not completed call for the
Davidsonians to join with stud- |
ents from up to seven other area
colleges in a march from the
Johnson C. Smith University |
campus in Charlotte to the main |
post office on Trade Street.

Purpose of the march is to
protest the expected Senate fili
buster over the civil rights bill.
At the end of their walk, the
demonstrators will mail copies
of a petition asking President
Lyndon Johnson to support the
bill “‘with every constitutional
and personal power" at his com-
mand. Copies of the petition are
now circulating on this campus,
according to Howell.

Howell, who with Prof. Philip
Secor is organizing Davidson
participation in the demonstra. |
tion, expects plans to be com
pleted early next week. He hopes |
that students from Livingstone |
College in Salisbury, Belmont
Abbey, Catawba College, Barber
Scotia College in Concord, Char
lotte College and Queens will
join the Davidson and Johnson
C. Smith marchers. Tentative
clearance for the march has
been issued by the Charlotte
Police Dept., Howell stated.

Optimistic that ‘‘at least be

will march, Howell sees their
participation as a vitally needed
expression to Negroes of the

saw all that | saw. He said
that he was surprised at some
of the things he saw.”

Walters. said that the worst
thing he found during his in-
spection was the over-abundance
of roaches. The domination of
the Slater facilities by these in
sects was noted in THE DAV-
IDSONIAN last week.

The inspector said that some
of the equipment in the kitchen
was old and at times did not
perform its functions adequate-
ly. “I also realize that the build-
ing in which the cafeteria is
operated is quite old,’’ he added.
“However, the state cannot al-
low the age of the building and
equipment to be an excuse for
the filth that I found during my
inspection of the place."

When asked to specify other
improper conditions that he
found, Walters replied, ‘‘Well,
the rest of it was just the lack
of cleanliness in general. For
instance, there was a lot of
grease around that should have
been cleaned up.”

Walters indicated that he
might talk to several college
officials on his visit here to-
day. “I also plan to send a
copy of my next report to the
general offices of Slater, if
conditions are not improved,”
he said.

Walters said that he made his
inspection before learning of the
DAVIDSONIAN article from a
local woman who called him
about conditions at the college's
eating facility. ‘I understand
that the paper made the inspec- ,
tion and took some pictures at |
night. Well, all I can say is that:
they. didn't have to wait until)

to see roaches on _— the}
walls,’ Walters said

“| will guarantee you this,” |
finished Walters, ‘’I intend to |
see those conditions of filth |
in that cafeteria cleaned up |
and have it brought up to
standard. It may take a while, |
and | will give a poor rating |
if | have to; but | intend to
see progress made. That's why
| pulled down the rating.”

Both Bryson and _ Business
Manager Robert A. Currie said
that they believe the expansion |
of the eating and dining facilities |

programmed for the Union will
help Slater provide better serv-
ice and aid in the sanitation of
the kitchen.

Currie said, “By increasing
the size and improving the lay-
out of the kitchen, it is hoped
that it will be easier to keep
facilities clean and that it will
make for more pleasant working
conditions. Due to the poor ven-
tilation in certain areas of the
kitchen, on warm days it is al-
most a sweat-shop.”

Walters, when informed of the
college's plans for improving the
Union and buying newer equip-
ment for the kitchen said, ‘I
understand that they plan to do
that. But that is no excuse for
not keeping their present facili-
ties clean."

Bryson said that the day be-
fore last week's DAVIDSONIAN
article, the college had arrang-
ed for a pest-control company to
spray the cafeteria once a week
instead of once-a-month as_ it
had been doing. He admitted at
the time that roaches were a
problem and that the college had
not taken successful steps in
the past to control them.

The inspector is empowered to
close any establishment — that
constitutes a health menace,
and if today's inspection reveals
that insufficient progress is be-
ing made toward improving cor
ditions in the Slater cafeteria,
either the health rating will be
lowered, or a number of people
may be looking for a new place
to eat on Saturday.

On Savings

Bond Chain

The federal government has ordered a crackdown on the
latest series of circulating chain letters that involve US savings

bonds.

In an opinion handed down by the Post Office Department
at the end of last week, such chain letters were declared
illegal even though they do not pass through the mails. The
order for a nation-wide enforcement of the postal lottery and
fraud laws accompanied the above statement by the postal

authorities.

Last November

and December

a number of Davidson

students became interested in originating some of the letters;
however, the ‘‘fad"’ has since left the campus,

Also, the Treasury Department has ordered their State
directors not to sell savings bonds when there is suspicion
