they will be pushing it before they reach the |

old city limits or any other familiar sights.
Still others are going to try their hands at
the, art of bumming. They sincerely believe
—some of them, at least—that in this way
they will be able to beat the old train home.
Those who try to bum home have the best
of wishes of each man in, the student body,
and everyone hopes that all the knights of the
road reach home on schedule time, and that
they will have just as merry a Christmas as
the rest of the fellows. Some of the boys
who start out on the trains will go as far as
they can onethe “steam cyars,” and then they
will have to take to the old buggy, wagon,
or maybe, shanks’ mares, to propel them the
rest of the way home.

Not all of the fellows are going home,
though. Some of them live too far away,
and the vacation period is so short that they
will have to remain on the campus during
that period. Although it will not be at all
as good as getting to go home for the holi-
days, they will have a very good time on the
“Hill,” for the members of the faculty and
the townspeople always treat in a royal way
the men who remain here, and it is a most
enjoyable time that all of them experience.

strongly urged that Federal aid was not a

D. B. Wharton in a clear and forceful
manner proved that the principle of Federal
aid is not a beautiful theory only but that it
is indisputably based on analagous precedents.
He exhaustively traced the development of
this principle through its various stages.

He was followed by Allen, who furthered

the bill as an almost inevitable increase of

The rejoinders were marked by brilliant

affirmations of certain flaws in the argu-

and has held it continuously since that
time. In connection with his work he
has been in Atlanta, Ga., to attend the
National Council of Churches.
