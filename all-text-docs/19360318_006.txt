LITERARY SOCIETIES MEET

PHILANTHROPIC
(Continued from Page 3)
recently started a literary que
tionnaire which is of great interest

to the members

At cach meeting three questions
of literary value are asked and at
the next meeting each man submits

the answer to as many of these as

he has been successtul enough to

find.

This will be continued till the end

of school and the man who has sub-

mitted the largest number of cor-
rect answers will receive a prize
Phe next program will be featured

by talks from three of the eight

new men who were taken into the

society last week
EUMENEAN
(Continued from Page 3)
White spoke on “Intellectual Curi-
Osity.”

From the old minutes and ex-
pense accounts of the Eumenean
Society Mawhinney gleaned the
contents of his: talk in speaking of
the rules which prevailed during
those days of the society. The fact
that fines were incurred by the
members for unbecoming positions
and speaking out of order and that
the society used to hold weekly de-
bates was claborated upon by Maw-
hinney

White, in discussing subject,

spoke of the “seeming lack of in
tellectual curiosity on the Davidson
campus and endeavored to explain
this lack upon the assumption that
the students did not have time to
devote to the pursuance of know
ledge other than that which was
required of them, He illustrated
his point with the life of Dr, Alexis

Carrel, head of the Rocketeller In-
