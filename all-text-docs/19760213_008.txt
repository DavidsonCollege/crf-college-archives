According to G. Paul York,

Ficklen eyes other worlds

is life outside the Davidson
campus; in fact, there are even
other students engaging in
wholesome collegiate fun and
games.

For any students with.cars,
take heed: be sure either to
park your car legally, or at
least pay your fines before
they gather too many cob-
webs, because an employee of
the University of California
student radio station was ar-
rested recently while doing a
live talk show; the campus
police came right into the
studio and hauled him away
from the microphone, with a
warrant for outstanding par-
king tickets.

Each fall on a day picked at
random for its beautiful wea-
ther, students at Wabash
College in Crawford, Indiana,

receive an all-campus holiday..

At 7:00 am the president

FICKLEN ~
climbs to the top of the
campus bell tower and de-
clares the holiday , because, he
believes, that ‘‘A holiday on
one of the most beautiful days
in the fall was as good for the
soul as work in the classroom
and library are good for the
mind —and, as a college, we
are concerned with both mind
and souls.’’ Personally, I
think we should get a holiday
if we ever have a week with no
rain, or maybe we can arrange
for all the bulbs in the library
to burn out simultaneously.

there are $33,500,000 worth of
unclaimed scholarships in
America, and for $13.95, he’ll
tell you what they are. No one
really knows much about the

well informed Mr. York (we
presume he has no college
debts himself), and the Main
State Consumer Council with
its usual reticence volunteers,
‘‘He appears to be honest, but
he hasn’t been around long
enough to have any comp-
laints.’’ No doubt the list
would not be as helpful as one
would think—probably all of
the scholarships are for mid-
gets with combined board
scores of 1600 who were born
in Kansas during a dust bown,
with Bulgarian parents and
who can name each of Toul-
ouse-Latrec’s works by mem-
ory, and admire John Birch.
So it’s probably no use unless
you are a midget, with board

Underdog wins burger competition

By DAVE KELLER and
ROGER BROWN

Double Burger, Cheese Bur-
ger, Chili Burger, Olive Bur-
ger, Rutabaga Burger, even
Warren Burger, are varia-
tions of America’s most ele-
gant and popular contribution
to International cuisine, the
Hamburger.

None contain ham, few con-
tain beef, but rather peanut
flakes or ground gristle. But
for all their shortcomings,
they still represent a vital
component of the American
Dream.

Hamburger making is an art
of infinite variation. To deter-
mine the state of the art in our
vicinity, we, two relentless
reporters, struck out for the
area’s most well-known ham-
burger establishments, those
being the Union Snack Bar,

the Bantam Chef, and the
Tastee-Freeze. Our goal was
to determine the relative qual-
ity of each top-of-the-line
hamburger so as to provide
you, the consumer, with a
means of comparison.

The hamburger has several
qualities which lend them-
selves to objective measure-
ment; among them are ingred-
ients, patty size, patty
weight, total weight, and
price. Some qualities of a
hamburger, though, elude ob-
jective measurement, so rath-
er than risk ambiguity
through the use of equivocal
adjectives, we have chosen to

relate these intangible quali-,

ties through the use of the
‘“Pascal’s Palate Response’’
scale, which ranges from’ one
to ten.

The next burger to come
under our scrutiny was Ban-
tam Chef’s Super Bantam
with cheese. The Bantam was
the heftiest of the three sub-

jects, weighing in at a whop-
ping eleven ounces. Its single
meat patty, ‘“‘guaranteed’’ 100
percent beef, was five inches in
diameter and three ounces in
weight. Other ingredients
were mayonnaise, ketchup,
mustard, lettuce, tomato, on-
ion, plus optional chili and cole
slaw, both of which added
greatly to the weight and the
flavor of the burger. The
_ Bantam received two 7.5’s on
the PPR scale, and its price
was 85 cents.

The Bantam Chef has re-
ceived a bad reputation over
the years, perhaps not without
justification. Now, however,
the folks at the Chef are
aiming to get some business,
and better food, weekly spec-
ials, and a good-looking wait-
ress are obvious improve-
ments.

sauce, cheese, and two meat
patties, each patty having a
diameter of 3% inches anda

weight of 2 oz.; total weight
was 8 oz. Ratings for the

employee said of the Special,
“The meat changes from week
to week, depending on what
kind of deal Ron (Scott) can
get from his supplier.”’

Our final subject was Tas-
tee-Freeze’s Big Tee, whose
two meat patties, 3% inches in
diameter and 1'% ounces each,
are combined with lettuce,
cheese, pickles, and special
sauce on a Big Mac-type
double bun. Total weight of
the burger was 5 3/8 ounces,
and price was 90 cents. The
Big Tee received a 5 and a 6 on
our scale.

Our study was a bit surpri-
sing; the underdog (underbur-
ger?) came out on top. The
Super Bantam is a tasty treat.
Of course the other burgers
were good but none combined
weight, condiments and taste
like the Super Bantam with
cheese.

So if you’re in a pickle, take
our advice: choose your burger
from the above options and
hustle your buns down to your
favorite seedy joint. Who
says? Sesame!!
