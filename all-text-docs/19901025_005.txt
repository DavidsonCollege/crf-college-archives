24 Hour Towing ~———_

- 2178

About three weeks ago a surge of fear shot through Davidson:
a certain unknown man followed a Davidson female back to her
dorm. This particular female was not physically harmed, but soon
after the incident, campus police escorts increased considerably,
only to fall again once the fear had been forgotten.

Since most of the editorial board is male, we can never assume
toimagine these fears. Columnist Sarah Carlson, however, knows
the fear of receiving a threatening phone call from a potential
rapist. And what she has said in her recent column concerning
these threats needs to be printed again: “I do not walk anywhere
alone on this campus. My friends and I travel in pairs or use the
escort service: AS. one of the ‘founder's of Davidson’s Rape.
enough friends cry as teas told me in sobs of an attack to know
better than to put myself in such an easily avoidable risky situ-
ation.” | )

There is.an escort service available at any hour. There are
campus police who do more than tow cars. Officers Ray Thrower,
Rick Moore, and Emory McLaughlin will listen to anybody any-
time about anything. Unless bike thefts and break-ins cease and
unless lighting on campus increases, it is sug gested that you use
the campus police: use the force, so to speak. Davidson College
is nota safe place, boys and girls. You’re not in Kansas anymore.

Apologies

The editorial board wishes to apologize to Bob Collins, Direc-
tor of Facilities Planning, for suffering the brunt of Davidsonian
furor over parking. Collins has nothing to do with parking. We
neglected to double-check our facts. Chief of Police Ray Thrower
is the appropriate administrator to whom towing gripes may be
directed.

Police Aren't Bad Guys

To the Editors:

Early Tuesday morning,
while the campus slept, a
runaway youth from Hun-
tersville prowled Davidson
looking for things to take.
He saw. my mountain bike
lying helplessly and vulncra-
bly unlocked behind Belk
Dorm. Remembering how
far a walk it was to satellite
parking, whcre he was
camped, he stole my bike.
He thoughtthat he was pretty
-clever.as he peddled offi into
the darkness.

however clever he may
have been, he was no match
for Davidson’s finest. I woke
with a start on. Tucsday
moming and ran downstairs;
I was unable to speak as I
looked at the treads marks
leading away from where my
bike had been. After class, I

reported the bicycle stolen,
and finally understood why
Ineeded to have itregistered
(the police need the serial
number). Within twelve
hours of my reporting the
theft, the police officers on
this campus had appre-
hended the youth and recov-
ered my beloved bikc, un-
scathed.

Responding to a call
about a youth on a golf cart
(apparently my bike wasn’t
good enough to get him to

., and from campus), the offi-
"cers arrested the bike thicf

and cuffed him. They took
him back to the Johnston
Police Complex and gave
him the third degree (I guess
they did). Upon interroga-
tion the evil youth admitted
stealing my bike, acar radio,
and the golf cart (well, he
said he was just borrowing

the cart).

The Davidson Police get
a pretty bum rap. I know
why, too, having collected
$140 worth of parking fines
in just the first month of
school. However, Davidson
is a changing placc and the
Cops are just trying to keep
up.

These guys have recov-
ered nine bikes alrcady this
ycar and they are taking the
robbers to court. Basically,
they are doing their jobs,
which means tickcting ille-
gally parkcd cars as well as
sleuthing and catching crimi-
nals. The point is, don’t
write them off as bad guys ©

just because they are strict;
they are also reasonable.

Sincerely,
MATTHEW M.. GANT

Opinions From Afar

Davidsonian takes on new
meaning when one lives
beyond the Concord and
Main intersection (i.e.
Montpellier, France), so I’d
just like to give a couple of
opinions on. Davidson
events.

THE ALCOHOL IS-
SUE: Well, you guys are
hating life. With the general
age limitat sixteen, only pre-
adolescents get carded here
-- not like that matters since
you drink wine. or beer at
every meal from diapers
onward.

_ In fact both wine and
beer are sometimes cheaper
than water in France and
‘Germany. So next time you
poor little underage punks

To the Editors: get humiliated trying to buy
Schaefer; think of us in an
Reading The —_ultra-cool” sidewalk pub—

slamming ultra-cheap Ger-
man brewskies.
THEPARKING PROB-
LEM: Whether the authori-
ties that be are obsessed with
towing or not, the fact that
you guys have cars atall is a
luxury. To buy gas here you

would have to tap into Rusk’s

size-of-a-third-world-na-
tion’s budget, then lcarnhow
to drive like a schizo (espe-
cially in France).

Only after clearing these
hurdles would you try to find
a parking space in some.
podunk thirteenth century
alley about two miles from
where you actually want to
go, not forgetting tolug your
stereo with you afterwards.
Of course, a$40 towing fine

still sucks (for you).
PERSONAL HABITS:
‘Tm sorry, but making an

“ issuc about one female with

hairy Icgs is a joke. Really.
Until you get on a bus or
train where everyone is hairy
and in addition stinks like
three day old rolled ciga-
rettes and stagnant body odor
you have no reason to com-
plain.

So that’s wrap-up #1
from Wurzburg, where I’m
ona ten day vacation. By the
way, I getanother 20-25 days
notincluding this, so ponder
that while you try to relax
over a piddly three day
Thanksgiving break.

Sincerely,
CHRIS CLARK '92
