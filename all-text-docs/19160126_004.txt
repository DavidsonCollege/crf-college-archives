Chambliss and Patton upheld the affir-
mative, and Woods, J. R., Scott, Allen
and Smith, F. H., upheld the negative.
In the Philanthropic Society, Ratchford,
Neal and Thames upheld the affirmative,
and McLeod, Ormand, Shaw and Cum-
ming the negative. Each speaker was

speeches. Drs. Richards, Harding and
Lingle acted as judges in the Eu, and

in the Phi.

The four men chosen in each socicty
