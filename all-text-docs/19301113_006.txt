THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 13, 1930

Increase in Attendance
Shown in State Schools

Gain. of 25,000 Children and an
Increase of Three Percent

Raleigh, Nov. 13—‘Both enrollment and
attendance in the public elementary and high
schools of the state for 1929-30 show an
increase over that of the preceding school
year,” declared State Superintendent of Pub-
lic Instruction A. T. Allen today in a state-
ment to the press. “Although this year’s in-
crease did not establish any new records,
there are a number of reasons for the im-
provement in this respect,” he continued.

Last year, there were 866,939 children en-
rolled, or 11,057 more than the number for
1928-29. This year’s addition is less than
half the increase of 1927-28, when there was
a gain of 24,627, a three per cent increase,
over the 1926-27 enrollment.

The present total enrollment is divided,
according to the statement issued by Super-
intendent Allen, into 607,344 white pupils
and 259,595 colored pupils. In other words,
70 per cent of the total school enrollment
is white and 30 per cent colored.

School attendance, or the average num-
ber of enrolfed pupils attending school daily,
has also increased. During 1929-30 there
was an average daily attendance of 672,895
pupils, both white and colored. This num-
ber represented an increase of 28,140 over
the attendance for the preceding year, and
lacked only 714 reaching the record year of
1927-28, when there was an increase of 28,-
854 pupils in average daily attendance. The
annual percentage increases in attendance
for the past several years are shown by
Superintendent Allen to be as follows: for
1925-26, | 1.6 per-cent; for 1926-27, 1.0 per
cent ; 1987-28, 4.5 per cent; 1928-29, .64 per
cent, and\ for 1929-30, 4.36 per cent.

Out of every 100 pupils enrolled last year,
77 were it average daily attendance. This
record, the\ highest yet made, is just four
more than im 1924-25, or an average increase

of less than \half a pupil a year. Among the |

schools for ‘white children the percentage
in attendance is 80, and for colored pupils
it is 72; but the colored improvement in at-

tendance for the five-year period has been |

slightly greater than that for the white race.
This increase in school enrollment and

attendance for 1929-30 is, according to Super-

intendent Allen, due to several causes:

First, during 1929-30, there were fewer
epidemics of contagious diseases than in pre-
vious years. During 1928-29 contagious dis-
eases were prevalent in many sections of the
state, and consequently the increase in school
attendance for that year was less than for
1927-28,

Second, many counties for the first time

operated a split term, closing the schools |

after running a month or six weeks,to allow
the children to help with cotton picking and
other work on the farm, and then reopen-
ing them again after this work had been
finished. In this way the number of absences

ended with many substitutes seeing action,
an entirely new team, with the exception of
Captain Fraley and Mathis, wearing the red
and black of Davidson.

McQueen, McCall, and Fraley all starred
in the Wildcat offensives, ‘while Brown and
Mathis were shining in the line.

Willis and Fox proved the most elusive
Terriers, while King and Carroll were out-
standing in the line.

attendance was maintained.
Third, in many systems a greater emphasis

|
than ever before was placed upon the mat- |

ter of impfoved school attendance. Many
superintendents put on attendance campaigns,
and the State Board of Charities and Wel-
fare through its division of school attend-
ance stressed its importance.

And.lastly, the economic depression began
to be felt and-many of the older boys and
girls who were formerly employed found
themselves without jobs, and so returned to
school.

Washington, D. C.—(IP)—‘Coonskin
coats, college caps and collegiate slang are
remnants of the irresponsible days of adoles-
cense that must be put aside upon entering
college,” Dr. Cloyd Heck Marvin, president
of the George Washington University, told
members of the Freshman class here this
year.

“Don't confuse the burning of gas with
the burning of mid-night oil,” he said. “You
may go further overland on the former, but
it won't get you as far on the road you are
to travel while in college. Loafing is a
diséase, a malfunctioning of worth-while en-
ergy. Choose as your friends those who are

|

going somewhere, and go with them.”
London, Eng.—(1P)—That another war
will break out in the Near East within_a
decade is the belief of H. G. Wells, well-
known English author and~historian.

Speaking at a conference on “The Strategy
of Peace,” Wells. said:

“Now is the time for men and women to
organize and to tell their governments that
if the governments want war, they can count
them out.”

Wells is not of the opinion that a memory
of the horrors of the last war will influence
people from entering another one.
