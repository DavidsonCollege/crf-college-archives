Y-Corps’ Program More Active Than Ever

By DAN VOORHIS

The Youth Student Service Corps
traditionally involves a large number of
Davidson stsudents in important commu-
nity services. This year’s program prom-
ises to be more active than ever, accord-
ing to Y President Doug Ammar.

The year began with the “Y-Thing”
on the lawn between Belk dorm and Vail
Commons. A large mostly freshmen
crowd milled around and asked questions
at the booths set up by each “Y” group.
After dark, a slide show testified to the
benefits of participating in the various Y
programs.

The response to this gathering
pleased the Y-Corps leaders. Some of the
groups have more members than ever.
But the problem in the past has been to
keep this interest high and channel it ef-
fectively.

Ammar said the difference between
this year and other years was a “really
good follow-up. The Y-Thing was on
Monday and by Thursday all of the pro-
grams had had meetings.”

More emphasis has been put on

_ udilding”g..—, namics, by letting the,
membérs interact more. Before, said
Ammar, meetings: would be straight
business and halfway through people
would start drifting out thé door. By the
end, only the leaders would be left.
“There was a lack of interest from the
heads on down,” Ammar said.

The Y-Corps consists of eight differ-
ent programs, Tutoring, Prison Visita-
tion, Community Center, Senior Citizen
Visits, CROP, Environmental, Day Care
and a program at the North Mecklenburg
YMCA.

The tutoring program, headed by

Kerry Holbrook, is one of the Y's largest
and most important. Begun by a Char-
lotte Church, the program was taken up
by Davidson students for the town of
Davidson. About 30 tutors go to the
Davidson Community Center three times
a week to help third through sixth graders
learn basic reading, writing, and arith-
metic.

“Their main problem is motivation,”
said Holbrook. “We try to make them
feel good about themselves and find
areas where they excel.” Once a week,
the tutors present a cultural program that
might feature a singer or a foreign stu-
dent.

The program, funded by the Gesth-
umene Baptist Church, can no longer be
supported by that church. The Y-Corps is
presently searching for a new source.

The Crop Program

The CROP program, lead by Beth
Maczka, holds weekly lunches on Thurs-
day at 12:30 in the 900 Room. CROP
fights world hunger by relaying the $1
donations for the lunch to third world

countries. The lunch consists of beans

and corn bread, food éaten in many of
those countries. But the menu has been
expanded with peanut butter and honey
to accomodate American tastes.

Last spring, CROP held a dance-a-
thon and on October 23 will hold a 10
kilometer walk-a-thon to raise money. A
quarter of this money will stay in David-
son.

The Day Care Program, co-ordinated
by Boo Hogan, plays with and teaches
children from six months to five years
old. Students, about 15 in all, go in shifts
five days a week. Hogan commented that

‘Where Peregrine is located now will
probably be a walkway to the new Post
Office, so I know I’m going to have to
move sometime,” Betty Johnson said.

In addition to this, the owners want a
larger facility. “Eventually we plan to

have the back open on to a patio with a
canvas top — kind of like a beer garden.
But, that’s down the road,” she said.

The Johnsons have already added a
back to the original building which will
be used as a new dining room. Also, they
plan to expand the menu, but not the
prices.

“working at the Day Care Center
broadens perspective and its refreshing.”

The Senior Citizens program, under
the direction of Ann Lofquist, aims to
connect members of the Senior Citizens
Center with Davidson students. The pro-
gram is popular and the number of stu-
dents, 25-30, corrents outnumbers the
seniors. The timing of the visits is indi-
vidual. Some students also visit the
Nursing Home on Sunday mornings.

The Prison Visitation program, ac-
cording to leader Norman Gordon, seeks
to “provide some kind of link with the
outside” for the prisoners.

About eight male students visit Hun-
tersville Minimum Security Prison. Five
girls carry on a correspondence with the

prisoners. The visitations occur on Fri-
day afternoons from 2 to 4.

The Community Center Program,
under Wendy Fulks, gets students to play
with children from the town. The pro-
gram, new last year, has about ten stu-
dents. There is a possibility that music
and art might be included with the play in

- the future.

The Y-Corps also helps at the North
Mecklenburg YMCA in Cornelius by re-
fereeing or coaching. This program is
headed by Mark Nottingham.

The Environmental Program, led by
Jan Withers, does environmentally use-
ful things in the community. Last year,
they helped winterize many Davidson
homes.

ATO To Fold

(Continued from page |)

Terry claimed that the closing at
ATO proves a theme he has harped on
from the beginning. “No group can sit
still and expect to survive,” Terry said.
“With the mood of the Court and the pre-
scence of the Commons, it takes savvy to

suirvive. 7) So _envkowbyg wis

Terry also recommended that all the
houses require their members to sign eat-
ing contracts in order to assure financial
stability. “It is necessary for the houses
to take their contracts seriously and for
the people to take their contracts seri-
ously,” he said.

According to Crone, all the ATO
members had signed cntracts and ATO
has been using contracts for two years.
The problem was not guaranteed loyalty,
but simply dwindling membership.

Terry believes that most houses are in
“good shape,” and he does not anticipate
any more closings this year, if the houses
follow the guidelines established by the
contracts for group occupancy of a house
on Patterson Court.

The current version of contract rec-
ommends that houses maintain at least
fifty members. Business Manager Bob
Currie had recommended last spring that
the limit be set at sixty.

Terry said that the College has no
plans for using the ATO house and is not
likely to make any plans. He said it

would be best to “leave the [ATO and
ETC] houses the way they are” until the
Patterson Court closings have been com-
pleted.

house for more than thirty years. The
house celebrated White’s 30th anniver-
sary last spring.

A few years ago, ATO started a re-
tirement program for their cooks. They
were the first house to devise such a pro-
gram. Fannie and Mable soon followed
suit, and now the retirement program is
part of each Court house’s business. The
College now supports the retirement pro-
gram, although the houses still must pay
10 percent of their cooks’ gross wages
into the fund.

Crone said that ATO is hoping to
“make a large contribution” to the retire-
ment fund before the house closes. He
said that ATO’s cash reserves and Cer-
tificate of Deposit at Davidson College
may be used to ensure proper financial
support for the fund.

The closing of ATO was the second
closing of a Patterson Court House with-
in the last six months. Former eating
house ETC, which folded last spring,
was the first house to fold since the early
1970s.
