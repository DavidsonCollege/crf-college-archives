Paragraphics....

The anonymous award of a ten thousand dollar
Endowment Fund to Davidson College was a
nohle move—well worth our sincere appreciation.
No doubt, good use will be made of this money
in aiding many students to secure an education
which would have been impossible otherwise. The
gift was made with a view toward enlarging this
institution's endowments for the forwarding of a

better Davidson.

Davidson College needs a school of journalism.
Freshmen enroll for work on the three college
publications with ng experience whatsoever in the
duties of their respective choives.

Previously, this need has been recognized by
faculty members and students alike but no defi-
nite steps have been taken to remedy the situation.
Better publications would inevitably result from
training received under instructors who Have had
previous contacts with this type of work.

What Can We Give....

Davidson men have always been noted for their
loyalty. In his Founder's Day address Friday
morning Dr. Lingle presented a challenge and a
very real opportunity to prove that loyalty. The
success or failure of the Centennial Building Pro-
gram is largely in our hands, For as undergrad-
uates we are the ones most vitally concernéd in
the immediate betterment of our @vllege.

Dr. Lingle, in his appeal for names, intimated
that we might be called on to contribute, our-
selves. Do we have to wait until requested? The
Davidsonian wishes to aid this program in every
way possible. To this end, we would like to find
outs Srst, what the students themselves feel is
most needed on our campus; second, how we as
undergraduates can contribute to the material_sui
cess of the program; thirdly, what part, if any,
your college newspaper can play in this campaign.

Within the wext few days ballots will be placed

in your chapel seats; Please check the project
which you fecl we need most. If you do not find
the improvement you desire listed, write it in.
Let’s make it our_building program!
- —— The staff will welcome any suggestions as to
how to secure more whole-hearted participation.
The co-operation of every man in the student
body is needed to make this well-laid plan a con-
crete reality.

gestions and efieicism that may appear in the
column irom time to time.

Those who have been elected to office for the
coming year are. no doubt, already forming their
plans. but since they are not vet in office, no sug-
westiOns OF eritiezsns are possible. Further, such
criticisms. etc., should come more from members
oi the three lower classes, rather than from those
of us who expect to graduate this year. Thus. I
should like to take this tears t comment on the
general value of the Davidson student govern-
ment, instead of otiering untimely, and probably
unwelcome suggestions to those coming into
office.

This past year has been a mpmentous and try-
ing one for student government in general. Such
‘crises as have been faced by other student govern-
ments have caused nuny to question the value
of student government in general. It is well,to
add that the manner in which our sister school, the
University of North Carolina disposed of her
crisis in student government, should serve to prove

and vatuable institution.
fice, T have had occasion to compare the Davidson
student government with those of a number of
other colleges, Such comparison always makes
me thankiul that our student government was so
carefully designed, and has been so carefully
operated ever since its installation. I recommend
such a comparison to anyone, and I feel no hesi-
tancy in saving that I believe my opinion will be
shared by whoever makes the comparison.

Recently, I heard several men praising the
student government of a very well-known insti-
tution, and setting it up as the smoothest in oper-
ation of all student government. Then a bystander
who had chanced to serve under the government
in question, remarked’: “No wonder it works
smoothly. There is nothing one cannot do under
it."~ In other words, it prohibitéd nothing. If
such is the price which is required to have a
smoot running student government, I sincerely
hope the Davidson student government will nczver
operate smoothly. However, I do not believe it
aaecessary to establish a weak system in order
to have a smooth running governnient. Tic,
there is probably no casier way to achieve such
case_of operation in a short time. Naturally, what
really ‘makes, or breaks any government is the
support or non-support of those governed by it.
In student government, one’s own contemporaries
often make the operation of the government diffi-
cult. In making a plea for even more whole-
hearted support of the Davidson student govern-
ment by the students, I realize, of course that
there are clements of our system which are un-
pleasant, and which may even be undesirable.
Nevertheless, these things 1 belicve to be rela-
tively unimportant, and 1 point with pride to the
student government of my college as one of the
most suecessiul ever instituted anywhere. I wish
TF couic impress this general view on those of the
student beady whom I know do not realize the
value of our system. Instead of trying further,
I challenge you to make the comparisons which I
inyself have made. |

In closing, let me add that there have been
times when I have been antagonistic toward stu-
dent government, but now that I am nearing the
close of my term of office, and can survey the sit-
uation more sanely, recognize the unspeakable
desirability of it to those who are, and who ever
will be, students of Davidson College.

Sincerely,
CARLETON B. CHAPMAN.

dent of the Senior Class, to submit a letter for
