Students tell

Holmes to take action on

By Apam Hickey
Staff Writer

Desperate for student guid-
ance, the Student Advisory Coun-
cil (SAC) to the Director of Resi-
dence Life conducted a survey of
231 students and obtained mixed
results on issues ranging from reno-
vations to policy changes.

“We wanted to gauge the opin-
ions of students on critical resi-
dence life issues that we need to
make decisions on,” said junior
Sara Beth Hamlin, Co-chair of the
council. :

Divided into two parts, the
survey first asked students to de-
cide from a list of reforms which
three they would most like to see
made.

The top three choices were
cable T.V. in residence hall rooms,
washing machines in residence

halls, and better lighting in rooms.

The second part of the survey
was free-response. It concerned
policies and services the Council
thought students might feel
strongly about.

Students were also asked to
answer questions concerning up-
coming renovations in the Sopho-
more residence halls.

They had to state whether they

would still use washing machines —

if they were coin-operated or if
they would take advantage of toi-
let-paper dispensers.

Consensus was reached on
some issues. Students say they want
to be allowed to remain on campus
after 5 p.m. on graduation day,
with 119 out of 129 responses fa-
voring such a policy change.

Students also gave general
approval to continuing the supply
of Tylenol and condoms: 131 out

Registration

process proposed
for campus groups

By WILL BrapsHAW
Staff Writer

Allcampus organizations will
have to be registered with the
Union, if a new college policy
which. will -be reviewed by the
Council on Campus and Religious
Life (CCRL) on November 14 is
put into effect.

The policy, which was intro-
duced by William Brown, the Di-
rector of the Union and coordina-
tor of student activities, is designed
to make it easier for the Union to
keep track of organizations oncam-
pus and to provide clearer path-
ways for student organizations to
get support from the college, ac-
cording to Brown.

“For years organizations have
existed in limbo,” Brown says.
“We have left it up to students to
swim on their own and figure it
[how to get funding and recogni-
tion] out. Over a period of years in
conversations with many people,
we decided this was another way
to help people. We are trying to
take a much more active step in
helping them (student organiza-
tions) be successful.”

This new policy would require
an annual registration process that
would happen in the spring. This
would let the Union keep track of
what organizations were in exist-
ence, and what students were in
leadership positions within the or-
ganization.

“People Fve talked to have
been very positive. SGA and stu-
dent leaders feel like it’s areal help
to them. ... We want to communi-
cate,” Brown says.

However, there will be some
conditions for registration. The
organization’s officers must be
current full-time students. The
goals of the organization cannot
violate the Constitution or North
Carolina law, nor can individuals
‘profit. An organization can donoth-

ing that recklessly or intentionally
endangers other people.

When asked how the registra-
tion policy would deal with
Patterson Court, Brown said he
was unsure. :

“They (the fraternities and).

eating houses) ‘have a pretty for-
mal relationship to the college.
Whether we would simply have
the PCC send a list of officers and
a statement which would register
them or have them do it individu-
ally, ’mnot sure. There is already
a very good process. authorizing
their existence. Whatever we do, it
will not be complicated,” Brown
said. :

Steve Shames, President of
Patterson Court, said he was un-
concerned about the new policy
having any kind of detrimental af-
fect on Patterson court and saw the
new policy as a good one.

“It will be nice to be able to
have a reference and a list of offic-
ers of organizations so people know
what is going on,” Shames said.
“There are some small problems
with wording that need to be
worked out to make sure it is clear,
so there can be no interpretation
contrary to what William is trying
to get across.”

According to Brown, there
will be a handbook printed in two
to three weeks that outlines this
new policy, in addition to provid-
ing a registry of campus leaders
and other policies and procedures
dealing with student life and use of
space on campus.

“This new policy will give
new organizations an initial con-
tact. We had a photography club
that was started by a couple inter-
ested students. One asked, ‘What
do I need to do to create this orga-
‘nization.?’ Now I would give them
a handbook and say, ‘Here’s how
you get started.’ Before it was

very muddy and awkward,” Brown
says.

of 147 students favored continued
availability.

Notall students who filled out
the survey answered each ques-
tion. Because of this, all issues do
not have an equal number of re-
sponses.

Answers to questions concern-
ing “cleanliness,” “mechanical
problems,” “timely responses,” and
“routine checks of senior apart-
ments” were inconclusive.

A small majority of students
approved of making lottery num-
bers conditional on previous years’
results, with 43 of the 85 responses
supporting the proposal.

Students indicated a desire for
more washing machines in resi-_
dence halls, but indicated that they
would not use coin-operated ones.

Said one student, “NO, we
already pay a laundry fee in our
tuition.”

demands for more

Hamlin points out that the
RLO does not receive any money
collected through the laundry, and
it would have to be compensated in
some way for costs incurred by
adding new machines.

Hamlin conceded that some
of the survey results are mislead-
ing. While 98 of 131 responses
favored more co-ed living facili-
ties, Hamlin is reluctant to misin-
terpret this as a mandate to inte-
grate residence halls.

“Maybe we shouldn’t have
asked that question. I don’t know
where to go with it. . . . Students
want more interaction, but we don’t
know in what venue,” she said.

In response to the results of
the survey, Director of Residence
Life Kurt Holmes stated, “I’m not
surprised. [But] It does help back
up some of what [the council] has
decided.” — ‘

Though he feels the survey
doesn’t provide all the answers,
Holmes stated it “lets us know
where to ask more questions.”

“Things which are small in
scope we can respond to,” said
Holmes, indicating that no imme-
diate action will be taken on the
more major issues involved.

He says he will not ignore the
findings. “I can promise will be a
part of the [upcoming] decisions,”
he says.

Hamlin and fellow co-chair
Dave Derrick are scheduled to meet
with Holmes todiscuss the survey’s
meanings before the whole coun-
cil meets again in mid-November.

Hamlin expressed gratitude to
those students who took part in the
survey, but cautioned, “Don’t ex-
pect immediate results. We need
to talk about [the implications]
again.”

which would take students to the
Korner Pub, Waffle House, and
other establishments they often fre-
quent when drunk.

The committee is well aware
that several legal and financial is-
sues must be overcome to estab-
lish such a program. ~

The committee will also ask
that tap-times be rolled back to two
a.m., the latest any establishment
can sell alcohol in North Carolina.
The trustees denied this request
last Spring.

The committee will also ask
that tobacco products be sold in the
Outpost, believing that some stu-
dents want to smoke when they
drink but have no cigarettes with
them.

The committee will encour-
age the establishment of Students
Against Drunk Driving which
might assume implementing the
committee’s recommendations,

Longer Outpost hours, a
greater variety of food, and an in-
crease in the Outpost budget to buy
more movies are some other rec-
ommendations. The committee
would also like the Union to offer
programs that run later into the
night. ;

Raising awareness was an-
other issue for the committee.
Drunk driving laws have made the

penalties for DWI much stricter
and serious. The committee fears
students are not aware of this and
that if they were aware, they would
be less likely to drink and drive.

Thecommittee would also like
the granting of off-campus living
privileges to be contingent on at-
tendance of a workshop on drunk
driving given by the Campus Po-
lice.

The committee has stated that
“it is definitely not the case that
this was just an attempt to get later
tap-times.”

“In the end drunk driving boils
down to a choice made by a drunk
student. We aim through this to
make that choice less frequently,
as well as to provide reasons to
choose not to do it,” the committee
said.
