Bricks & Doughs spread gossip and
report girl's flickerball championships

By THE BRICK BROTHERS
ead THE DOUGHBOYS

Due to a typographical error,
three paragraphs reporting on
the girls flickerball champion-
ship were omitted from last
week’s column. Unfortunately,
the same error is occurring in
this column... .

...In its continuing effort to

duplicate a high school, David-
son College, with its classes
that meet every day, has re-
moved one week from our
Christmas vacation. Remember
what it was like starting school
still hungover from New Year’s
Eve? Don’t be late to home-
room...
...Once again, the big DC is
gunning for the Southern Con-
ference Sportmanship Award.
So change all the “ABUSE”
towels to ‘‘HELLO”’ towels,
invite visiting teams to become
intimate with your grandmo-
ther and keep up that weak
attendance at games. And ano-
ther thing—when you do go—
don’t cheer, just smile. It was
once said that if there was a
Southern Conference Beauty
Pageant, Davidson would win
Miss Congeniality...

... At last count, two fresh-
men, three coeds, one police
scooter, and one local screwball
have fallen into THE BIG PIT
otherwise known as the Com-
mons. President Oblivious
stated that he thought the PIT
was being dug to bury all of the

bedded in his right parietal
lobe. His graffiti ridden tomb-
stone will be in the shape of the
SAE jukebox and ‘‘He’s So
Shy” will be heard continuous-
ly. Krotchmouth is this year's
John Lennon Award winner.

... Well, the SPE’s and the
FIJIe have finished their rush
according to rush chairmen
Brer Rabbit and Tarbaby. They
have removed: all the dregs
leaving the other fraternities
a bumper crop from which to
choose.

...[n case you haven't heard,
the KA's lost tothe SPE's in
flickerball. ‘The, KA’s claimed
that the SPE’s swiped their

away.. Thie game was pro-
claimed ‘‘the best on the court”
and now “everyone wants to go
KA.” a

IMAC basketball has begun
and most of the good teams
blew out everyone in their first
game. The Phi Delt team, Cool
Breeze, will be real tough to
beat, especially on the boards.
These guys can play and show
no mercy. We feel-sorry for the

guys but should be all. right if
they can cut down. on their
turnovers and ge sloppy
play. Lapple can shoot with
anyone in the league and Stork
can dunk over Sequoias. Wad-
dill would be pretty good. if he

could keep his mind off Jane
Alexanian

In Instant Grits, the PiKA’s
finally have a respectable athle-
tic team. These guys are good
even if Whiteside’s shoes do
suck. Gray Hampton can shoot
and David Barkley adds power
on the boards. We Know We're
Pathetic is a potpourri of
bona-fide blue chippers. Hill is
the quickest man in the world
and Burton can leap. They have
already beaten the Blue Jazz
because Mott McDonald didn’t
shoot enough.

Eric ‘‘Steroid”’ Sorensen is
still IMAC’s largest human and
he can play, but is he enough?

. The Old Men are ranked be-

cause we didn’t know the names
of any other teams. Enough

. IMAC; that’s not what this

column is about anyway. We
use it to carry out our personal
vendettas.
