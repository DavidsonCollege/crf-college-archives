expresses a liking for
Davidson's non-subsidized

program in soccer.

“The quality of the soccer
isn't quite as good as the ACC
but the game is a lot more fun
here.” he claimed.

Blackwood was a high school
star in the Washington, D. C.
area before he made his choice
to come to Davidson. He feels
high school soccer was not quite
as physically rough as college.

He expressed dissatifactions
with the inconsistency of the
refereeing, both at home and
away games.

Both players showed a keen
interest in the volatile and vocal
crowds that lay upon the banks
at home games.
