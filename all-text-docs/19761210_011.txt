The Union gives Davidson the Atlanta Rhythm
Section for a Christmas present. Atlanta’s most
demanded studio group is a rare composite of six
highly seasoned and talented musicians.

The Atlanta Rhythm Section debuts their album
“Another Man’s Woman’”’ just released by Decca
Records. Along with producer Buddy Buie, the
group members have written over 21 chart singles as
recorded by many pop music artists. Some hits
include ‘‘Stormy”’, ‘‘Traces’’, ‘‘Mighty Clouds of

Members of the group are J. R. Cobb, Robert
Nix, Rodney Justo, Paul Goddard, Dean Daugh-
tery, and Barry Bailey.

The concert is part of the Union’s effort to attract
groups at times other than big weekends. As Bob
Myer, Social Vice President of the Union, says,
‘Chris Hillman and the Atlanta Rhythm Section are
part of the new concept of the concert committee
which is not just limited to big weekends.”

He continues, ‘‘When we get a desperate deal from
an agent or group that we think will satisfy
students, and we can afford, we'll jump on it.”’

Potter shows and Sells;

throws work on 115

If you've an inkling to give a pot for
Christmas you’re in luck: John Chris-
tian, potter, has taken up residence in
Davidson. His showroom is located
approximately a mile north of town on
Highway 115—next to the remains of
Hattie’s.

Previously located in a garage
studio on Concord Road, Christian
acquired his new_studio a month ago.
He is just now stocking his shelves,
and although his cupboards be some-
what bare one can easily perceive a
unique style in his work, particularly
in his use of glazes.

His goal being that of developing a
stoneware product, Christian’s pot-

tery is all hand thrown and all his
glazes are mixed from scratch.

The pots run from mug size to
lamp-base proportions. Christian has
concocted a copper-based green glaze
of forest-green hue and a quite
uncommon dullish blue glaze, his
ingredients range from potash to iron
products, and chemical proportions
are most carefully balanced to procure
the exact shade intended.

He fires his pots to 2400 degrees —
hence, they can ‘be used for baking.
And all his products are lead-free.
‘“’Tis a far cry from pinch-pot Easter
baskets and Play-dough snakes.’’
(The extent of this writer’s expertise!)

Chapel Hill, Christian built his own
kickwheel and set to work. He later
attended pottery courses at Gaston
College, followed by courses and
work at Central Piedmont Commun-
ity College in 1975. In 1973, he
studied pottery at the University of
Guadalajara (University of Mexico)
for eight weeks and spent five months
in Colorado Springs working in
pottery and jewelry.

Since February of this year Chris-
tian has been teaching for the
Department of Continuing Education
at Central Piedmont and is presently
teaching at the Davidson Community
Center. Christian has exhibited his
work at Festival in the Park in
Charlotte this past September and
has also exhibited at Davidson Town
Day

His pots will be for sale at the
Union Craft Fair this weekend and
intends to hold his own crafts fair this
spring, incorporating weavers and
other artisans into his studio/work-
shop. Christian hopes to build a 25-30
cubic foot kiln outside the shop.

Christian will be selling both retail
and wholesale and is now doing
commissioned work for some resi-
dents of Davidson. He will accept
special orders, adhering to specifica-
tions as to design within the limits of
the medium.

With perhaps a little Christmas
shopping in mind, a visit to John
Christian’s shop along with a refresh-
ing chat with a man who gets his
hands dirty would certainly be worth
the trip.
