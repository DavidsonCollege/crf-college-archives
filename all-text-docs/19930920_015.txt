Hockey

ends week

wit

with a win
By Nancy Hilles

Last week the Davidson field
hockey team had three challenging
games against Duke University,
Kent State and Wake Forest. The
Wildcats were considered the un-
derdog in each game never having
beaten Duke, and last season they
lost to Kent State 2-0. Davidson
ended 1-2 atthe week’s end, losing
to the Blue Devils 4-0, beating
Kent 1-0 and losing to Wake 1-0.

Although the Wildcats were
outplayed by a stronger, better-
skilled Duke team on Wednesday,
September 15. The game was a
good learning experience for
Davidson, according toteam mem-
bers. They held the Blue Devils to
ascore of 1-0 at the end of the first
half.

Early in the game, Davidson
had to alter its defensive strategy
and instead of covering spaces on
the field, the Cats were forced to
mark up on individual players at
all times. The Wildcats made this
transition well, but they had a dif-
ficult time shifting the ball to their
offensive end of the field.

In the last fifteen minutes of
the game, however, the Cats had a
spark of offensive energy and had

several break-aways, including
Nicole Ficeto’s rush on the Duke

goal.

After the game, Coach Pryor
told the team that she was proud of
their persistent efforts and deter-
mined spirit. No matter what the
scoreboard read, the Wildcats never
gave up and continued to play with
heart. Even with the loss, Coach
Pryor was positive: “This game
has shown me what the team needs
toworkon. It really was a learning
experience and I think we can use
that to our advantage.”

The victory over Kent State
on Saturday, September 18 was a
big win for the Cats. Missy Potts
scored in the first five minutes of
the game with a hard shot on goal.
That gave the team a lift from the
start. Theteam played defensively
as Kent State tried to make a come
back.

Emily Coleman had somekey
saves and Davidson’s defense
managed to hold them off. Ac-
cording to team members, Kent
State was extremely physical.
Despite their roughness, the Cats
maintained their cool.

On Sunday, September 19, the
Wildcats fell 1-0 to Wake’s young
and skilled team. From the begin-
ning, Wake set the pace for the
game with the Cats reacting to
them. According to players, they
got “flustered;” instead of playing
their small passing game, the Cats
were using big hits to try to get the
ball up the field.

Right center back Jill Bennett
had a great save at the goal line
when a ball deflected off of goalie
Emily Coleman’s pads.

Defender Erin Lang alsohada
good game.

Unfinished Business was fi-
nally finished on Thursday night
with Davidson’s 1-0 victory. Who
came up with that Unfinished Busi-
ness idea anyway? Could it be
coach Slagle? Well, at least 1,800
people showed up to see the game.
Now that our soccer games are
receiving hype like this, isn’t it
time that the same be done for the
football and basketball teams?

Give Neal Andrews credit for
his performance Thursday night.
Allhe didin replacing Alex Deegan
was hold UNCC to no goals and
make three tremendous saves.
Andrews, like so many athletes,
only needed a chance and he pre-
vailed with the opportunity.

Great win for the Cats on Sat-
urday and we love the uniforms.
We would like to see, however, a
black, Clemson- like paw on the
helmet instead of the "cats." We
liked the Howell-Holzworth
combo in the backfield, but
couldn’t they disguise it a little
better? Rhodes keyed on it and
stuffed them two plays in a row.

Wehavesome questions about
the semiformal attire at football
games. If you are going to wear a
tie, there should at least be cocktail
parties. We question groups of guys
at football games with ties and no
dates. Besides all that a football
game is a place for face paint and

What better.time to leave
the country?

Just think. Next semester you can continue your major in another country. You can intern
in London, ponder Peace Studies in Austria, cycle to class in Oxford or sun yourself in
Mexico (while studying Spanish, of course). You can even linger at a cafe in Vienna or tour a
Greek isle. We also have a wide variety of integrated university programs in the U.K. and
Ireland. For over 30 years Beaver has been sending students abroad for the experience of

bare chests, not ties.

What the heck is going on
with Baker? It now closes at ten
o’clock, instead of the promised
closing hour of midnight. We
thought with the new alcohol policy
that Baker would be opened longer,
Some of us really benefited from
those extra hours.

Instead of sitting around drink-
ing at night, we were able to goand
play basketball for two hours. Now
we will have to return to our old
ways.

What happened with Will
Neville at the volleyball game
against UNC on Tuesday night?
Neville’s crucial call in favor of
UNC gave them the victory. The
Lady Cats played extraordinarily
well, and the outcome did not de-
serve to fall in Neville’s hand.

Some random thoughts:
Wouldn’t it be nice to see a Satur-
day night football game under the
lights? What is going on with
Covington National?

What is the situation with the
arrogated greens? Why can’t that
water cooler on the first hole ever
be filled? For four years there have
been paper cups out there, but no
water.

Will those greens ever return
to championship form? Why can’t
the par four number two hole be
divided into two thus saving all
those balls from flying at WDAV?
Why does Lloyd-Still’s IMAC
flickerball teams always have to
play on field #4 with no lines or
spectators?

‘What is the situation with the
outdoor basketball court? Why is
there a light pole in the middle of
one of the courts and on the other
side, why can’t that big oak tree be
trimmed so we can get some shots
off? Hell, Baker’s never open.

Look fora JV baseball team at
Davidson soon. Over twenty fresh-
men came for fall practices this
season. How about Andy Paul in
the Milwaukee Brewers organiza-
tion this past summer? He posted
some impressive numbers in Class
A Beloit.

Finally, we would like to con-
gratulate sports marketing for the
television contract.
