VMI Holds Cat Rally

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

VMI held off a 14 point surge
in the last quarter to beat
Davidson 24-17 last Saturday.

The loss dropped the Cats to
a 1-8 overall record and an 0-6
mark in the conference. The
loss practically insures the
Cats of last place in the
Southern Conference this
year.

In many ways it was the
team’s most frustrating loss of
the season. After two good
showings against William and
Mary and the Air Force
Academy, it was hoped that
Davidson could break into the
win column for the second
time this year against VMI.

VMI dominated thefirst half,
taking a 17-0 lead at halftime.
VMI's first score came on a 21-
yard pass with six minutes left
in the first quarter. A 33-yard
field goal with 16 seconds left
in the quarter made the score
10-0 in favor of the Keydets.

VMI's next score came on a
64-yard drive lasting close to
10 minutes.

Davidson's first score came
late in the third quarter when
Jack Stultz kicked a 26-yard

Emory Crushes Cat Booters,

Stone Optimistic For Future

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

Traveling to Atlanta, Ga.,
the Davidson soccer team en-
ded its 1973 season with a 6-1
loss to Emory University.

The defeat capped a 5-7-2
seasonal mark for the Cats un-
der the leadership of first
year head coach Chip Stone.

“I must admit I was not
pleased with the record of the
team,’’ Stone pointed out.
“There were two es that
we lost and two that we tied
which we should have won.”’

Those kind of results
plagued Stone’s debut in the
coaching realm, having
replaced the late Harry
Fogleman during the spring of
last year.

But Stone has a great deal of
optimism for the future of
Davidson soccer.

“Things look pretty good for
us next year,’’ Stone em-

phasized. ‘I know what we
have got and we have quite a
few players coming back,
many of them with a lot of ex-
perience.”

Stone also feels the recent
move by the trustees, which
will strive for more financial
support of the minor sports at
Davidson, will be of
siginificant aid in the coming
years.

‘We will have better equip-
ment because of the extra
financial funds we will be
receiving,’ Stone said in sup-
port of his feelings on the new
monetary situation.

But the Cats will still not be
able to have a comprehensive
recruiting program for the
soccer program due to a lack
of funds.

But Stone, however, added
that he intended to ‘‘write let-
ters and make some calls’’ to
many prospective booters in

Ruggers Close Season
With Two Point Loss

By ANN BODE
Staff Writer

Davidson Rugby Club
finished its fall season with a
16-14 loss against Charlotte.
The match was hard fought
with both teams scoring an
equal number of tries, but an
extra point kick put Charlotte
ahead in the final statistics.

Duncan Moore at wing led
the Davidson offense in
scoring two well-deserved
tries. Moore claimed his first
score by touching down a foot
rush started by Dave Kitrell.

Davidson then scored again
when the alert Moore slipped
through the Charlotte back
line to carry the ball all the
way into touch.

David Kitrell was respon-
sible for the rest of the David-

San-points. when. be.charged in-.:::sen downfall?) :1::ryersssseerss eye

to the end zone with the ball,
and then kicked his own extra
points.

Davidson's major problem
during the game was in the set
scrums. The ball rarely came
out on the Davidson side, ana
Charlotte’s backs took good
advantage of this offensive
edge.

Set scrums especially hurt
when Charlotte was deep in
Davidson territory. Charlotte
backs were able to get the ball
quickly from the scrum and
move it almost into touch
before the Davidson forwards
could break out of the scrum.

After the game, Paul Scott,
playing prop commented, ‘In
such a close game, this small
advantage for the Charlotte
team proved to be the David-

hopes of getting some talent to
bolster the team in the coming
year. Stone did note the
disadvantages of not
having the money to travel
and actually ‘‘see the guys
play.”

At any rate the soccer
program here seems to be on
the move, despite the failure
of the team to reach the high
expectations Stone had for
them this year.

“‘We did. not get to where we
wanted to be,’’ Stone ad-
mitted. ‘‘But we are going to
improve the soccer program
and reach those goals soon.”’

field goal. Midway in the four-
th quarter, VMI scored their
final touchdown making the
score 24-3.

With less than six minutes
the Cats mounted two quick
scoring drives of 53 and 50 yar-
ds. The first touchdown came
on a 10-yard pass from Dave
Harper to Dave Ingold. Ingold
also scored the Cats other
touchdown on a five-yard run.

“I guess it was just a case of
too little too late,’’ Ingold said
after the game.

The loss dropped the Cats in-
to last place in the Southern
Conference, leaving them only
one more chance to record a
win against a conference for
this year.

The Cats main problem was
their inability to stop the ball
control tactics of the VMI
squad. Most of the Keydet
scores came on long marches
that ate up the clock.

VMI relied on their running
backs to use up time. The
Keydets had 72 rushing plays
in comparison to a total of 62
plays for the Cats. As a team,
VMI rushed for 324 yards
against Davidson, an average
of almost five yards a carry.

As expected, Davidson led
in the passing department.
Harper completed 18 of 43
attempts for 140 yards.

Ingold led the Cat's
weak rushing attack with 18
yards in six carries. Overall,
the Cats managed a meager 33
yards on the ground as three
Davidson ball carriers ended
the day with minus yardage.

In fairness to the Cats
however, it must be pointed
out that they went into the
VMI contest with several star-
ters out and several more
unable to play at full strength
after the Air Force game.

Indicative of the Cat’s depth
problems was tackle Jim
Spears who started for injured
Al Schaberg. Spears was in-
jured early in the game and
had to be replaced by
Schaberg, who was not com-
pletely recovered from an in-
jury incurred several weeks
ago.

Before the game head coach
Dave Fagg had expressed
cooncern with the injury
problems that have plagued
the Cats all season.
