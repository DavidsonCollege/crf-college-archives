Davidson Students
Can be Painfully Frustrating

By Rafael A. H. Candelario II
By the time you read this, I'll
be in my second week of jump
school. Before I get to
the main topic of my let-

campus. When I say that I can’t
stand Davidson, I mean you, the
students frustrate me, not the in-

There should be no ignorant
Davidson students. If your ideas
concerning minorities are
based on what you heard

from friends or saw on

ter I'd like to thank my
professors for their un-
derstanding and allowing
me to attend Airborne
School. I’m writing you
not because I have a big
mouth with a lot to say,
but because, contrary to
popular belief, I’m hu-
man and have feelings

When I say that I can't stand

tion or the administration. Yes, the
administration could help out mi-
nority students more, but the ad-
ministration is only a representa-
tion of the student body.

T.V., you really need to
reevaluate your thinking.
The best way to Start re-
learning is just by talking
to a black student. He or
she will not bite your head
off. Drop your. stere-
Otypes and just open your
mind. Other ways toleam

many nights when I sitand cry and

Observer my words were miscon-

upon me that] cannot shake. I had

administration is only a represen-

Why do! blame my frustration
on you? I’m not going to answer
this for every black or minority
student, but sometimes I am made
to feel as if I’m unwelcome or
unwanted in my own “home.”
Some of my friends and I have

quired multicultural class
and have a racial aware-
ness seminar during freshman ori-
entation. But to have these re-
quirements, all students need to
get involved.

I know many of you don’t
believe that racial tension exists at

‘ Davidson, but it does. Just ask if

you doubt; the incidents are nu-
merous and so far nothing has
turned into violence. At the forum
on the 24th, Laura Cunningham
stated that nothing gets better be-

Racial tension and racism ex-

be dealt with if all of us work to

A Conversation on Chambers

Es

It is late on week 15 of the Fall
semester, and ‘‘A;,” one half of the
“Questionin’ That” team, takes
time to relieve stress by posing as
a figurine on Chambers. After a
time, the bells sound and, an

enormous hunch-backed figure,
arises over the dome.on the build-

ing. Alone with a box of “Hot
Wings” and a light saber, “A:”
attempts to speak with this being....
A: Who are you?
JPD: Man, you must not know
who I am-
A: This building is off limits to
anyone but members of “Students
for Figurines on Chambers.” You
haven’t been to any of our meet-
ings, so I assume that you don’t
belong here. So, I'll repeat my
question. Who are you?
JPD: First of all, I’m a student at
Davidson College. Second, I am
the man, Ebony man, known as
“Joey,” but you can call me J-P-D.
I have recently found these figu-
rines_ very fascinating, because
these figurines seem so life-like.
A: Well, I appreciate that! There
~ aren’t too many of us around who

admire these figurines. What do
you find particularly interesting
about them?

JPD: Methinks these are some of
the finest babies I ever didsee, The
beauty, however, exists only on
the outside. True beauty exists
within. Symbolically, they mean
so much more. Ina stressful envi-
ronment, I often times find others
as wellas myself somewhat trapped
inhell (Yo’ A:, you leftoff the “s,”
so it should read “somewhat
trapped in a shell’).

A: I’ve never thought of them in
that way. Can you elaborate?
JPD: The shell I speak of entails
racial tension, discrimination,
oppression, and, last but not least,
ignorance. Our world is much like
the world of the statue,

Imagine, if you will, a world filled

with absolute darkness, a world

filled with silence in which you
can speak and never be heard. This
is what I envision as the world of
the statue. :

A: That's deep, man, and to be
sure, you pontificate well. Tome,

T guess these statues represent

timeless elements of the campus.
While I may be among the elect
few to have such close contact
with these figures, they see it all
andremain silent. Ifsomeone were
to ask one of these figurines about

“intolerance” and “tension,” how :

do you think they would respond?
JPD: They would say that today
we are faced with the same prob-
lems of the past.

A: What do you mean?

JPD: Well, excuse me if I begin to
pontificate further, but this morn-
ing I had a talk with a fine young
lady who I admire very much, and
we began to discuss reverse dis-
crimination and affirmative action.
And she stated that she would feel
bad if she were not given a job if
she were bette qualified than a
minority. I {went on to say that
oppression breeds oppression.
Reverse discrimination is the re-
sult of a self-inflicted wound, and
it’s inevitable that we will reap
what our ancestors have sown.
A: What does that have to do with

Many of us have felt a consid-
erable rise in what has been termed
“tensions on campus” this fall.
From F.L.A.G. to offensive post-
ers to racial concerns, it seems like
the Davidson Campus has suddenly
become just as mixed up as the rest
of the world, being unsure of what
steps to take conceming such major
issues as sexuality and minority/
majority relations.

At an open forum held just
before Thanksgiving break well
over one hundred concerned stu-
dents gathered in Hodson Hall and
talked freely with each other about
various.tensions at Davidson Col-
lege. I was extremely impressed
with how many campus leaders
were present. I saw students on the
SGA, officers in various Patterson
Court houses, individual commit-
tee leaders, and even members of
the faculty and administration. In
addition to these involved people
there were several freshmen pres-
ent as well. They came because
they wanted to learn more, be-
cause they wanted to get involved
and have a voice in their school’s
welfare. The forum lasted about
an hour and a half and several
people expressed their concerns
on what they believe is happening
at Davidson. When it was over,
some people may have left the
forum, like I did, wondering just
what has prompted this sudden
burst of tensions. Perhaps some us
wondered if Davidson is the only
school experiencing strained rela-
tionsamongits students. Andmany
of us probably wondered while we
walked home: is there any way for
us to rise above this and restore
some sort of unity to our campus?

One of the biggest problems
that emerges on most college
campuses is what one might term
“interpretation.” Often itis hard to
fully understand what someone has
said when you hear it second or
third hand. Since our campus is a
small one we all have the opportu-’
nity to see, speak with, and get to
know, many differentpeople. This
is good in a community sense but
can sometimes pose problems
when stories and gossip are con-
cerned. Indeed, several of us, at
one time or another, have felt vic-
timized by the “smallness” of
Davidson. One of the problemsis
that we hear so many different
things about so many different
people that we sometimes forget
the exact words or the context in
which they were spoken. Even
though this may sound trivial, it
can goa long way toward instigat-
ing a confrontation.

* Another temptation Davidson
students sometimes fall prey to is
the desire to generalize and group
people. The Women in Warner
Hall or Rusk, the men in Phi Delta
Theta or Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the

s

Students Need To
See The Bigger Picture

Independents or members of The
Black Student Coalition, even the
people involved in the Union; all
these have certain stereotypes that
have evolved over the years.
However, one of the problems with
these stereotypes is that they often
outlive the people involved in the
organizations--that is, the average
Davidson student is only here for
four years, but the organizations
he or she may have been involved
with continue tocarry on long after
their departure.

What is worse, though, is that
people are misguided into believ-
ing Stereotypes offer a quick,
simple method of “summing up”
an entire organization. This is
simply nottrue, No organization is
merely one person cloned fifty or
one hundred times. Eating houses
and social clubs may involve and
attract groups of women and men
who have some of the same views
on social activities, but beyond that
viewsand values invariably change
from one person to the next. It
simply cannot be said that just
because a person is a member of a
certain committee or a certain
house than he or she thinks exactly
the same as the other members of
the committee or the house.

A clear example of this. is
prevalentevery where on our cam-
pus right now. Amid all of the
tensions and debates you can still
look around and see individuals of
all races, creeds, and nationalities
talking, having fun, and being
friends with one another. In fact, I
believe itis an extremely small and
self deprived percentage of the
Davidsoncommunity thatdoes not .
have at least one friend who hap-
pens fo be of a differentrace, creed,
ornationality. We know wecanbe
sensitive and understanding toeach
other’s wants and needs because
we are already doing it on an indi-
vidual level. Now we need to take
that same understanding, on all
sides, and apply it to each other

collectively.

Davidson is not alone i in its
quest to ease tensions on campus.
Many other colleges and universi-
ties around the nation are wres-
tling with the same questions we
are. This does not mean we should
sit back and wait to see what they
do about their problems. Ours is a
community that draws from the
very finest and brightest students
applying to colleges throughout
the nation.

We owe it to ourselves not
only to work through our differ-
ences, but also to serve as amodel
of effectiveness for other schools
facing the same challenge. The
fall semester has been full of ques-
tions, from all sides, concerning
numerous things, ‘I hope many of

you share my desire to see the

spring semester provide the an-
swers,
