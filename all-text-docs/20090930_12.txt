In wet conditions, Caskey leads men’s
soccer to 4-1 upset of #25 Gamecocks

A team wanting to be recog-
nized on a national stage must have
a tough schedule including many
non-conference and nationally
ranked opponents. Not only is this
schedule vital to a team gaining
national recognition, but winning
these matches is the most important
task after the schedule is made.

Davidson hosted and dominat-
ed the No. 25 nationally ranked op-
ponent, on Friday night at Alumni
Stadium. Putting on a soccer clinic
packed with an amazing offensive
outing, superior defensive skill,
and an extensive level of team co-
hesiveness, Davidson showed its
fans what Davidson soccer is all
about. Defeating the Gamecocks
by a score of 4-1 in front of nearly
1000 fans, Davidson improved to
6-1 this season.

“The team stepped up their
game for such a big opponent,”
Coach Matt Spear said. “I really
enjoyed watching the team accom-

Cats drop first two games in

Southern Conference play

JoHN MorGan
Staff Writer

Wrapping up a_ three-week,
five-game stretch of road games,
the women’s soccer team dropped
tough contests against Western
Carolina and Appalachian State
last weekend. In both matches, the
*Cats maintained steady possession
and control but couldn’t convert
opportunities into points.

Friday night brought the squad
to the mountains of Cullowhee,
NC, to face the Catamounts of
Western Carolina. From the get-go,
the offense opened up an aggres-
sive front, letting off several shots
within the first few minutes.

“We started really well,” head
coach Greg Ashton said. “Playing
on the road, coming off the bus,
getting a good start is critical. Our
effort, energy, and composure were
spot on.” Stephanie Gerow ’12,
Blakely Low °10 and Kyri Bye-
Nagel 10 all recorded shots in the
opening minutes.

As the first half closed with
both teams at nil, the home team re-
gained its stance against the Wild-
cat attack. “When we didn’t score,
it gave the opposition a chance to
settle down and weather the storm,”
Ashton said.

In the second half, the Cata-
mounts converted their effort into

an offensive advance. Just five
minutes into the period, they ripped
a shot off the crossbar, rattling the
Wildcat confidence. Then in quick
succession, six minutes later, a free
kick scraped through Davidson’s
defensive front.

After that opening stint, the
Western Carolina offense failed
to break through for a third goal
against keeper Jessie Baxa 12,
who notched four saves in the con-
test. But the one-two punch would
be enough to quell the ’Cats in the
opening match of SoCon action.
Despite leading the shot tally 12-8,
Davidson could not capitalize on
its repeated attempts on goal.

Amid the adversity, Ashton’s
coaching style still advises a con-
stant course. “We’re trying to be a
more possession-oriented team,”
he said. “We want to make con-
secutive passes to get into the final
third. And really, that’s my philoso-
phy as a coach right now to keep
playing this way.”

For him, it’s about service to his
players, who’ve worked within the
pass-heavy structure all year. “I’m
optimistic that the team will keep
persevering with what I’m asking
them to do. I’m not about to just
throw everything we’ve done out
