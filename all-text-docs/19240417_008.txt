Guilford Game

Davidson received another defeat, at the
hands of the Guilford nine, last Saturday on
the home diamond. Guilford scored two runs
in both the first and fourth innings, while the
Wildcats failed to squeeze a single man
across the plate.
Davidson’s best bid for a score came in
the sixth frame when Covington led off with
the only two-bagger of the game and Johnson
followed with a single. Johnson’s hit was a
doubtful fly between second wnd center field,
however, and Covington in waiting to tag
up if necessary lost his chance to score.
Two of Guilford’s runs came in the first
inning when they got four hits out of six
men up. Laird then entered the box for the
Wildcats and held them scoreless for all ex-
cept the fourth, when they chalked up two

more counters.

N. C. State Game
The N. C. State nine handed the Wildcats

a 10-1 defeat here this afternoon in a slow
contest. The State nine piled up a five-run
lead in the first two innings off McPherson
and got to Kimbrough for four more in the
sixth,

When. Simpson drove Sion Alford across
with the Wildcats’ lone tally inthe ninth he
broke their string of 3* consecutive score-
less innings. Ted Covington starred at the
bat for the Wildcats with two hits and two
walks out of five trips to the plate.

Correll and Lassiter led the State attack,
Correll getting a double and a single and
Lassiter a triple and a single. The Techmen
scored on all three pitchers, knocking out
11 hits, having only four men left on base.

Gilbert at short for State handled 10
chances without an error.

Ten Wildcats were stranded on the paths.
S. Alford at short knocked out two hits and
scored the Wildcats’ tally. The fielding of
Covington and Simpson featured for the
Wildcats, both of them handling difficult
chances,

The Techmen made the most of every
chance and played a bang-up brand of base-
ball, while the Wildcats lost several chances
to score through inability to hit in the
pinches.

Co-Eds Flirt With Nicot |

Brown University women of the minority
group would like to have a smoking room.
This followed the suggestion at the women’s
student government convention at Oberlin,
Ohio, of the delegate’ from Pembroke, that
girls in her school were demanding the same.
Eleven of the collegesand universities repre-
sented there had no rule against smoking,
and Bernard College reported a rule permit-
ting students to smoke.—Ex,

If wishes were wild onions, and wild on-
ions were dollars, Trinity would be Duke
University—Trinity Chronicle.

Another world’s record was broken when
two students of the University of Iowa, Dan
Gilson and Judson Large, established an en-
durance record by playing bridge consecu-
tively for 25 hours. The play began at 4:00
p. m. Saturday and ended at 5:30 p. m. on
Sunday.—Ex.

_A new spirit of friendliness has invaded
the University of South Carolina campus
with the introduction of “Hello” week. So-
rority girls, college men, staid professors,
and even janitors are going out of their way
to say “hello,” smile and shake hands.—Ex.

Nickel a Piece for Math Answer

With the introduction of mercenary re-
warded students of his math class for their
work, Prof. Hubert Evelyn Bray and math
200 have become suddenly popular, and it is
probable that Bray will have to, handle at
least a dozen classes next year. There is
developing a heavy demand for math 200
since the monetary element was introduced

into it recently by the Rice professor.

It all started when Bray placed a nickel
upon his desk and offered it to anyone who
could identify a peculiar mathematical figure
that he had drawn on the blackboard—Rice
Thresher,

Tiring of the monotonous life at the uni-
versity, two Ohio State students recently set
out for a few months’ adventure in other
parts of the world. They took a freight to
Cleveland, from where they plan to bum au-
tomobile rides to New York, and thence
board a ship to some European port.—Ex.

Ohio State University is making an effort
to install polo as a major sport and has pur-
chased 16 ponies to be drilled by the officers
of the military department—Ex.

The University of Arizona in a recent in-
vestigation found that the married men had
a slightly higher scholastic average than the
the unmarried men of the student body.—Ex.

This progressive age con-
stantly discovers a better
way of doing things—always
improve s — develops
processes that excell.

Our tailors at Fashion Park,
for instance, have developed
the Turole tailoring treat-
ment—a method of making
“soft” clothing possessing
all the fine lines that well
groomed men demand.

__EFIRD'S .

Turole is pliant—has easy,
comfortable lines—conforms
to the wearer’s action or in-
action—is thoroughly dis-
tinguished.

The Turole tailoring treat-
ment is available in a series
of interesting style develop-

ments—we’re making a spe-
cial exhibit of them now.
