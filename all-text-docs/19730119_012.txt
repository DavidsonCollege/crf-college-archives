Davidson Experiences Little

Of National “Transfer Boom”

By LARRY MIMMS
Staff Writer

Davidson College has not vet
felt the impact of the nation-
wide “transfer boom” which
has spread among universities
and community colleges, ac-
cording to Registrar Richard C.
Burts.

According to national studies
an estimated 500.000 to 600,00
students will transter trom one
college to another this’ vear,
which represents a significant
increase in numbers of students
transterring. This | mass
migration, termed by some
authorities as a “‘transter
boom” has been telt especially
in: many of the community
colleges.

Contrary to national trends,
the number of students from
Davidson transterring to other
coleges has not signiticantly in-

creased. The number of students
transfering out has ranged
from 10 to 20 during each of the
past 6 vears.

Vice president for Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan
suggested that one reason for
the national increase in trans-
fers has been the deescalation
of the Vietman War. He pointed
out that many students were
atraid that) by transferring.
they would call attention to
themselves. and he predicted
that there would be an even
larger increase in transters
when the war is ended.

One Davidson student stated
the trend was perhaps due to a
new student attitude in seeking a
different academic and social
environment.

Whatever, the cause of the
national transter boom. the

PCC Reorganizes
Eating Club System

By BETSY ALEXANDER
Staff Writer

The Patterson Court Council
(PCC) reorganized freshman
eating club orientation this year
in an effort to better familiarize
freshmen with the system and
to better equip them to make
their decisions.

After attending open house at
each of the nine houses on Pat-
terson Court last week, the
freshmen listed in order of
preference their top four
choices.

Beginning this week until the
end of the term, each fresh-
man will eat two meals a day
for one week at his first two
preferences. The final decision
by the students will be made on
or about March 21.

Freshmen also have the op-
tion of not eating at any of the
houses. With last year's system,
freshmen were randomly
assigned a house and then could
not eat in the cafeteria on those
assigned days.

“The emphasis,” according
to PCC President Jim Thom-
pson, “‘is to allow freshmen sole
responsibility for their decision
with minimum pressure from

that genuinely contribute to the
development of human beings.”
At this point, he mentioned the
desirability of an arts and craf-
ts area.

‘‘We need to take a hard-
nosed look at these proposals,
determine how much money
Davidson is willing to spend on
a new union, and raise the
money,”’ he said. Smith
suggested that a union could be
financed by gifts, foundations,
borrowed money from the
government, and student fees.
“Students will have to pay
something,” he added.

Pointing out that the
proposals for the new union
were scheduled to have been
completed by October 31, 1972,
Student Body President Ralph
Peeples said he was ‘‘disap-
pointed” tohave waited that long
for this (the new proposals).
“There's been a lot of foot-
dragging and they're behind

schedule,"’ Peeples said.

Commenting on the
feasibility of the plans, Peeples
said that Smith might be asking
for the ideal union in hopes of
getting just some of the
proposals approved.

“This is more ambitious than

the Davidson College Union has
ever been and the proposals are
a good basis for discussion,”’ he
said. ‘‘But administrators are
going to have to limit
discussion, make some hard
decisions, and start moving,”
he said.

the houses. During open house,
each house on the court was to
entertain, to sell themselves to
the freshman by convincing
him that he would be welcome if
he self-selected in."

Dean of Students Will Terry
believed this method is better
because ‘“‘the system is more
familiar now to the houses. The
co-operation of all but one house
has been superior."

The PCC was budgeted
$13,500 to use in improving
boarding facilities and overall
appearance of the houses on the
court. ‘‘From this money,” said
Thompson, ‘‘the goal is to
establish individuality on the
court and a good atmosphere
for students to socialize and
relax.”

Several freshmen, however,
expressed discontent about the
system.

“It didn't seem like the people
in the fraternities were very in-
terested,’ said one freshman.
‘‘Not very many of them were
there."

Another commented that ‘‘It
seems a shame that you have to
join a fraternity to have any
social life. We were promised
all this great stuff, parties and
fun all the time. We can’t un-
derstand why our friends at a
big school with a big. student
union are having fun, and we
aren't.”

Davidson have been
traditionally the same over the
vears. Dean of Stuents, Will
Terry said, ‘90 per cent of trans-
fers leave becuase they cannot
get the course of study they
desire: they want to go to school
nearer their home; or they are
simply dissatisfied.

“Most everyone thinks about
transferring, out at one time,
because ‘the grass looks
greener on the other side’.”” he
said.

In contrast, trom. 1966-71 the
number of transters into David-
son from other colleges has
been stable, varving between
four and nine; however, with
coeducation ino 1972 figures
changed. Thirty men apphed, of
which twelve enrolled, and 37

women apphed of which 28
enrolled.
If the transter boom hits

Davidson it will be in the area ot
transter-in students. Director of
Admissions, H. Edmunds White
predicts that he will receive an
mecreasiny number ol transler-
in applications in response to
Davidson's new coed policies.
but very few men will be ac-
cepted tor the upcoming vear.
The admissions office is en-
couraging women transfers and
expects to enroll more than 60
coed transters.

Burts) stated that = most
students who transter-in do ex-
pect to lose some course credit,
‘and that the few conflicts that
do arise result from a student's
misunderstanding of course
transfer rules.

One potential problem comes
in the transter policy statement
that the “registrar accepts
courses consistent with the
academic objectives of David-
son College.”

Burts explained that David-
son College would accept cour-
ses which were similar and con-
sistent to ones at Davidson, and
would not accept some courses
that) were considered — in-
consistant with academic cour-
ses at Davidson. He cited an
example, the engineering course
ot “Strength of Materials” as
an untransterable course.

The major problems of trans-
fer-in students, will go hand in
hand with the problems otf
coeducation simply because
most of the new transter-in's
will be coeds, Burts sand.
