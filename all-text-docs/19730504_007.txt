Students Say President Needs
More Contact Around Campus

After interviewing appro-
ximately 25 students inresearch
of their opinions of President
Spencer, two conclusions are
evident.

First, many students  in-
terviewed were reluctant to talk
about President Spencer and
second, a large number of those
questioned knew very little or
nothing about him or his
policies.

Only two students wished to
have their names attached to
their opinions. Many others of
those interviewed answered by
saying either, ‘I don't know
what he does,"’ of **I don’t know
anything about his policies."

One sophomore expressed his
lack of information in this way,
“Spencer's activities seem to be
a bit nebulous to me. He doesn't
arouse my ire like Bevan
and Burts who have policies
which are at least tangible.
Maybe I am not up on Spencer,
and I am not informed on his
policies."’

Kevin James advanced a
possible reason for the lack of
student knowledge of Spencer.

‘I think President Spencer is
very much a behind the scenes
worker. People like Bevan get
more credit, but I am sure he is

actively involved in for-
mulating all policies.” he
said.

One of the most frequent
criticisms of Spencer was his
lack of good student contacts.

‘*My impression of him is that
he is probably very effective in
raising funds, but on the cam-
pus he is too distant from the
students,’’ said an_ up-
perclassman.

Another student said, ‘‘!
question whether he really

knows the concerns of students
and his contacts with students
are minimal.

“He is open to students’

suggestions, but what happens
after the suggestion stage. In
general however, he does a
commendable job.”’

Expanding on the idea of
student contacts. one coed said
that Spencer “could stand a bet-
ter rapport with the coeds, but it
has been the first vear.

“It will take time to get better
contacts. The best he could do
was make the transition he did,
but hopefully next year more
programs with him will be
initiated,” she said.

Very few opinions were ex-
pressed on specific policies of
President Spencer.

“I think his policy of ‘Any
Questions’ is good and I hope

that students will take ac-
vantage of it,’ said Richie
Williams.

One student advanced a

strong criticism of President
Spencer's policies.

‘He came from a girls’ school
and I think he tried to make a
girls’ school out of Davidson. He
tried to do away with frater-
nities, football and has brought
girls here.

“I would have been happier if
he had stayed at the girls’
school,”’ he said.

Speaking in general on
President Spencer's _ per-
formance, one student said,

“Dr. Spencer seems to do a
good job of compromising dif-
ferent interests of the college. A
lot of times he acts a little in-
dependently, but mostly he is
open to both student and faculty

‘needs and interests.”

“He is a symbol of the
college. He is a very eloquent
speaker that makes you proud
that he is the president of
Davidson College. He is very
much a part of the Davidson
tradition,‘ said James.

Administrators

The three alumni sat leisurely
on the steps of the Union last
Saturday and reminisced. One
of them seemed to. be
especially taken back by the

_ changes that he insisted the

college had undergone since he
left (in 1967).

“This place has completely
changed since he's been here,"’
he said. He was talking about
Davidson College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

Has Davidson changed in the
four years since Spencer
arrived? The best answer to
this question came from the two
men who together personify the
change that has taken place un-

der Spencer: Vice President for
Academic , Affairs John M.
Bevan, and Vice President for
Finance and Development C.
David Cornell.

According to Cornell, the
mere fact that both he and
Bevan are here is evidence of
the current of change that ac-
companied, and was partially
effected by, Spencer.

Bevan stated that his pre-
sense on this campus is indica-
tive of a trend to streamline the
administration in an effort to
cope with the heightened pace
of running the college.

Bevan and Cornell outlined
three major trends in the com-
plexion of the college and its
operation during the Spencer
years which represent a

Faculty Express Varied Opinions
Spencer's Presidency

Concerning

With obvious reluctance.
faculty members recently ex-
pressed their opinions of
College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr.

The opinions of the members
contacted differed substantially
from individual to individual.
although ambivalent feelings
toward Spencer were frequen-
tly encountered.

For instance, Drama
Professor Rupert T. Barber Jr.
said, “Dr. Spencer is seemingly
sympathetic to the cause of the
arts at Davidson, but we do not
have the new staff member
whom our department needs.’

Art Professor Larry L. Ligo
also sees Spencer as a SUup-
porter of the arts, “He is recep-
tive to the Art Department at
Davidson, a department which
was once a black sheep. This is
a move in the right direction."

However, speaking in more
general terms, Ligo said, “l
don’t think he plays his cards
well as a president. I think he
has good things to offer, but he
needs to offer them
diplomatically.

‘He has a tendency to push
his programs through, An
example is the hiring of Vice
President for Finance and
Development C. David Cornell

and the elevating of Dean of
Students Will Terry,” he said.

‘Spencer is also in a difficult
spot when it comes to making
innovations. If he moves too
fast. the alumni are displeased.
If he moves too slow, the faculty
and students are.

“I think he’s doing a good job.
but he could be doing a better
one.’ Ligo concluded.

Another faculty member.

seemed to agree. “He's done
some things right, and he’s done
some things wrong,”’ he said.

“Spencer does have a poor
relationship with the faculty.

“The best symptomatic issue
is that of whether or not the
president should consult the
faculty before making
decisions, "’ he said.

President Emeritus D. Grier
Martin consulted the faculty;
Sam does not always do this.”

Professor of Philosophy Earl
R. MacCormac also sees
problems in Spencer's relation-
ship with the faculty. ‘‘I think
there's a gap between the two,”
he said. MacCormac declined to
specify the causes of this
situation.

He did say that the
president's job is becoming
more and more one of fund-
raising rather than academic
leadership.

“It's sad that this is the case,

but it’s inevitable.” he said.
Only the president can do some
of the important large-scale
fund-raising, MacCormac_in-
dicated.

On the other hand, Professor
of Education Jay H. Ostwalt
emphasized that the president
is still responsible for the entire
program. ‘‘He has got to know
what's going on everywhere,”
Ostwalt said.

“The academic quality of the
institution should be a_ basic
concern of the president. I think
this has been neglected
somewhat. Fund-raising may
be overly emphasized.’ added
Ostwalt.

Speaking on the relationship
between the faculty and the
president, Ostwalt said, **I don’t
think that the faculty's
strengths are used as much as
they could be, but I do not think
that the president has stepped
in and_ taken faculty
prerogatives.

Professor of Biology Donald
L. Kimmel praised Spencer,
‘He's been very supportive to
me in changing some emphases
in the department. ‘I have a
good, easy relationship with
him.

“If there's one criticism I
have, it is that I wish he knew

more details about the
academic program, _par-
ticularly in regard to pre-
medicine.”

significant break with the past.

First, both men felt that a
shift in emphasis had taken
place, to an attitude which re-
gards Davidson as a part of the
national community, being
forced to deal with the outside
world much more so than in the
past, and change with it.

Bevan cited as examples of
this, the modification of the
fraternity system, the in-
stitution of the Honors College
and its spirit of program
flexibility which is very much in
vogue in higher education
today.

Cornell acknowledged this
shift and cited as his examples,
the greater concern that his
staff has recently shown in mat-
ters of alumni and public
relations and the potential
strengthening of the college
through these channels.

The second trend of the Spen-
cer years deals with the actual
operation of the college.

necessity, we have adopted a
more aggressive attitude of
doing things in recent years,
especially in terms of policy
decisions.

Coeducation, the Blue Sky
program, and what Cornell
called ‘the systematic planning

exemplify this pattern, one in
which important decisions were
made at the instant that they
were needed, and not put off to
stew and complicate as had

been the pattern before Spencer
came to Davidson.
