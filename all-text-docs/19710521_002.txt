Of Long Range Planning

* By ALEC HOON
News Editor

Inia sparsely -attended Open
End, Vice President of Fi-
nance and Development C.
David Cornell emphasized
the need for long-range eco-
nomic planning tat Davidson.

“The administration willl
spend a lot of time this sum-
mer sitting and thinking. We
will try to build some five
and ten year plans,’’ Cornell
said Monday night.

Specifically he referred to
the possibility of deferned
giving projects, aiming at
a 30 miillion dollar endow-
ment fund,

One likely prospect in
building the endowment is
unitrust. As Cornell explain-
ed iit, under this system don-
ors pllace funds in college
hands in the form of .a trust.

The donor mainialins his
‘earnings from the endow-
ment without paying capital
gains taxes. Opom the mia-
turiity of the unlitrust (the

death of ithe donor), the ‘trust

funds become part of the
college endowment.

Comell indicated ithiat, the
uniitrust Serves mot only as
an endowment builder for
the college, but also as an
important tax break for the
donor.

When questioned about thic
financial laid situation, Cor-
nell remarked that ‘‘there is
ai present ino crisis.

“There willl only be 1a crisis
when ia siignificant mumber
of students dant afford to
attend Davidson. The aid of-
fered here is mow higher
ithan lat many comparable in-
stitutions,

“I wefuse to panic until

Edmunds) White tells me
that ‘we tare im ttirouble."’

Addressing the subject of
the budget just approved by
the trustees,Cornell pointed
out ‘hat approximiattely $550,-

financial aid, an increase of
over $100,000.

<'m very sympathetic to
the’ students’ finlancial aiid’
problems. We are constantly
looking for mew ‘sources of
help,”’ he said.

Cornell mentioned tthe pos-
sibility of getting state aid
for the first time. He pointed
to two bills pending in the
North Carolina legislature.

One proposal would offer
direct grants for needy North
Carolina students. In. the oth-
er, the state would provide
direct payment to schools for
accepting 'N. ‘C. students.

“Tam all for thils aid, I've
very successfully im (Calliffor-
nia ‘and Iowa,” he salid.

Several students questioned
the. college's justification in
spending so much money to
‘build the new library when
there were so many other
pressing financial meeds.

(Cornell replied that ‘‘to
keep Davidson ia viallble in-
stitution, tthe college made a
commitment to build tthe new
library; if ithéy waited there
was \a distinct possibility that
it would never be built.’’

“Secondly, the dibrary was
committed in Grier Martin's
administration, laind half the
money, which was waised
then, can be used only to
build the libriary.’’

When queried about the
possibilities for coeducation,
he responded that the real
problem was iin finding the
money required (to ‘build tihe
necessary ladditlional facili-
ties, and ito establish addi-
ditional programs which girls
would want,

“I would note that one sig-
nificant svep has been made
in the establishment of the
Queens College Exchange
Program. There willl be five
girls from Queens attending
Davidson next year under
the prognam,’’ he stated.

A ‘student then asked about

Cornell explained ithe prob-

purpose of collecting more
football money and operat-
ing on a calendar basis, had
collected about $80,000 for
1971 out of a goal of $120,000.

Terry Deplores Problem
Of Campus Drug Abuse

By WINDY MARCH
! Staff Writer

Recently, Dean of Students
Will H. Terry played a partial
role in stopping a group of
students from selling a large
amount of hashish, a can-
nabis drug, on the Davidson
campus. In an_ interview
Tuesday, Terry expressed
concern. about the ability of
the college to handle prob-
lems resulting from  grow-
ing drug use on campus.

‘‘Many students,” he said,
“‘want sanctuary from the
law. in using illegal drugs,
and think the college will
provide it; it cannot be that
way.” However, he said thiat
the college would want to
insure that students in legal
trouble over the use of illegal
drugs wree treated with legal
fairness.

“But,” he added, ‘‘federal,
state. or local police need no
permission from the college
ta search dorm rooms, «as
long as they have a warrant.”
He further said that he would
have no qualms about using
police action to stop out-
siders who sell drugs on cam-

pus, though he has no first-
hand knowledge of such ac-
tivities taking place.

He stated that he has re—~

ceived a small amount of
criticism from local citizens
about the use of drugs on
the Davidson Campus.

Terry's views on the use

of counseling programs to
help solve the drug problem
seemed somewhat pesisimis-
tic. ‘‘No one would be more
in ifavor. of it than I,’’ ihe
said, ‘‘but few students have
evidenced any real interest
in working up sucha. pro:
gram.

“Much of ‘the talk about
such a program jis a well-
used cover-up to insure thiat
nothing is done. It is often
a cover-up, but let me slay
emphatically that it need not
be.”’

To ‘attempt to eliminate
the problem now, he said,
would be difficult and pro-
bably disruptive. He does not
agree with ‘the use of ‘in-
forming agents by the col-
lege, or with tthe knowing
admission of paiid police
agents to the student body.

“It has been my impres-
siion,”’ he said, ‘‘that the
college is’ practically con-
cerned with the dealer. If
that ‘impression is correct, I
am in agreement with this
practice.”’

Tenry views the dealer as
“a bootlegger selling a dan-
gerous product to people he
does not know or care ‘about.

“There is ‘litte doubt in
my mind thait miainy of ithe
personal ‘and tadademic pro-
blems I have dealt wiith in
the last few months are re-
lated to drug use. Anyone
who uses dope is a damn
fool."’

allowed ‘to do so without any
selective process was deleted

from the final resolution
when SGA President Danny
Clodfelter reminded the
group that they had just

passed a resolution to re-
mind students of ‘the serious
shortage of spaces for mar-
nied students iin the town.

An amendment was pass-
ed .suggesting that the off-
campus living. policy be
liberalized.

Clodfelter listed. some of
the speakers who have been
contacted ‘about appearing
on campus next year. Among
‘those mentioned were Sen-
ators Henry- Jackson, Walter
Mondale, William Proxmire,-
Aljan Cranston, and George
McGovern Former Sen.
Charles Goodell, who heads
the Republican ‘‘Dump
Nixon’’ movement, and Mar-
garet Mead were also listed.

Clodfelter then announced |
the creation of two study
committees. — one on. sub-
sidization of \athletics and the
other to plan strategy on co-
education — land opened
them to interested students
who would contact him.

The meeting closed with
a discussion of the proposed
new ‘academic regulations.

of Responsibility. Also
many students questioned
who would be making value
judgments about student
conduct. According to Bev-
an, the Faculty Executive
Committee would first de-
cide, then the faculty would,
and any decision could be
appealed to the Board of
Trustees. —~

According to Director of
Instructional ~. Development
Jay H. Ostwalt this stipula-
tion has only been used once
before, and this was. in a
murder case involving two

students a number of years

ago.
