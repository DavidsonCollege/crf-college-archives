Feb, 8, 1939

Now that exams are over the Winter sports schedule again is about
to get into full swing with the basketball, and wrestling teams going
into action. Then Coach McEver has his prospective gridmen
working out daily down on the Freshman field, and the inter-fraternit
basketball tournament has advanced through the first round. It seems
that even the one-and-only Mid-Winters will not disturb the athletics,
because the wrestlers have a at on Friday, and the
basketball team plays V. P. I. at Winston-Salem on Saturday night.
Tough luck, boys!

Basketball seems to be the talk of the Southern Conference
schools these days—at least at Davidson. I guess that is because we
are all looking forward to our boys coming through with excellent
success in the Conference standings.

Gene

meet Carolina

Although we do have six wins
to our credit as against two defeats, the hopes of the team fell con-
siderably Monday when it was learned that J. D. (Slick) Hieks had
been confined to the Infirmary and would not be able to make the
trip to Carolina and Duke. Then Ned Iverson strained his ankle in
practice Monday, and it is very likely that he will have some trouble
with it. These two handicaps added to Benny Harrison’s arm
injury make the outlook seem rather dark for the present at least.

This quint has looked mighty good most of the time this year, and
except for the South Carolina and Guilford games they have showed
such rare form as will be sure to get them into the Conferenee Tourna-
ment. The team members are looking forward eagerly to getting in
the Tourney so that they can uphold the name of the school. When
they do get to their aim—Raleigh during the first week in) March—
the Davidson student body can count on their team going through at
least to the semi-finals, because the boys are primed to knock off some
of these big-name teams, such as Wake Forest, Maryland, ete. How-
ever, substitutes count a great deal in the grueling grind of the tourna-
ment, and Davidson isn’t especially blessed with competent substitutes.

Duke though and the had better watch the Devils,

because they have three teams of practically equal strength, That's what

is, other teams

counts.

All of North Carolina seems to be concerned about Davidson's

athletic policy—except Davidson.

Wake Forest students are sar-

castically asking for an answer, but | am rather embarrassed to
admit that I have no explanation to offer, simply because I do not
know why we have practically broken up the Big Five. It seems
that while most of us were sitting around viewing the different
aspects of the situation, the administration was acting. Well, some-
thing had to be done sooner or later, and at least I am glad that
we have chosen our policy although it may not be agreeable to some
of us. However, I am sorry that we dropped Wake Farest off our
football schedule first, because after all it is the only school of

Davidson’s type in the Big Five.

Prospects are not so bright at

present, of course, but for about five years straight the Wildcats
wiped the ground with the Demon Deacons, but did they drop us

from their schedule?
at this point?

Why, no!

straight dope on the matter.

In the feature match of the aft-

and ready scrap. Another interest-
ing match was the one in which Ed
Ellis of Davidson gained a decis-
ion over Brandt of State.

However, the rest of the David-
son wrestlers did not fare so well.
The ‘Cats were in their full
strength last Saturday afternoon.
Capt. Joe Craver was out of the
line-up because of a side injury,
and “Dizzy Dave” McLean was un-

In the Frosh meet, Spencer and

pinned Faison of State in 4:08 min-
