THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 3, 1923

TO THE ALUMNI:

During the present college year the
Alumni Editor has attempted to make
these columns of more and more inter-

- &t to those who have passed through
the portals of the Alma Mater into real
life. If your name, or the names of your
friends have not appeared on this page,
you are largely to blame.

As the new staff is now taking charge
of the paper, it is hoped that the alumni
will cooperate with the newly appointed
Alumni Editor. It is my purpose to
make this page in reality what the name
implies, but this can only be done through
your assistance. If you have any infor-
mation about alumni of the college don’t
hesitate to send it in. Your cooperation
is urgently requested,

PROF. LOMAX DISCUSSES
SPIRITUALS OF NEGRO

to his readings, saying he was born in
Mississippi in 1870, and had for a long
time taken a great interest in the negro
religious songs, or Spirituals. Mr. Lo-
max pointed to the fact that the negro
of today does not generally take his re-
ligion as a vital part of his life and does
not connect it with his ideas of morality.
Never does he think of using his religion
to solve industrial and other personal
and community problems. However, we
should not look down upon the negro and
think his religion totally a failure be-
cause of the fact that there is often in
it more of the ridiculous than of the re-
ligious. It has been, Mr. Lomax said,
only a short time, comparatively speak-
ing, since the negro was in utter barbar-

ing post-graduate work. Houston ex-

ism in his native land of Africa, and we
cannot reasonably expect him to have
risen to the level of the Anglo-Saxon in
this time.

Professor Lomax disclaimed any desire
to ridicule or mock the negro in his re-
ligious activities, for they are very serious
and solemn matters to the negro himself.
He said he was in wholehearted sym-
pathy with the negro and was ever eager
to do all possible to help him in his pro-
gress upward. It was in this spirit that
the speaker gave many selections of negro
folk songs which he had taken down from
the different negro meetings he had at-
tended. Many of them had a decided
vein of humor in them and in some there
was an equal element of lyrical genius.
All of them had the musical swing so
characteristic of all negro music.

It was of interest to note the easy fa-
miliarity of the negro toward God and

The management announces that the
picture this week will be Glimpses of the
Moon, with Bebe Daniels and Nita Naldi,
an Allan Dwan production. There is
no doubt that Allen Dwan has produced
one of the greatest pictures in the history

of the industry, in producing “Robin
Hood.”
Tapestries, antique furniture, rare

paintings and other properties used to
give The Glimpses of the Moon, taken
from Edith Wharton’s novel, a lavish and
costly background were valued at $712,-
050,000. All of New York’s art shops
and antique stores were searched for the
material used in the Vanderlyn palace
and the Altringham villa, homes of the
idle rich, so that they would appear just
as described by the author.

Miss Daniels says that every time you
do a charitable act, every time you do
something worth while; every time your
thoughts are tempered with magnanimity
toward your fellows you experience what
I believe to be glimpses of the moon mo-
ments. There is something about the
moon when it shines in all its glory that
brings a peaceful calm to those who
look on from the earth below. Almost
anyone can verify the last statement, but
to appreciate the full force of this para-
graph one must either read the novel or
see this picture.

The past session has seen the best
movies ever brought to Davidson College.
All of the pictures shown have been re-
markably good, and some have stood
among the foremost in the history of the
industry. The five best pictures of the
year, Manslaughter, To Have and to
Hold, Back Home and Broke, When

Knighthood Was in Flower and Robin | ‘= ae
CL YY CY

Hood, have been shown here while they
were yet recent releases. The manage-
ment deserves much credit for its excel-
lent selections. Some of the pictures yet
to be shown are: Racing Hearts, One
Exciting Night, The Pilgrim and Sher-
lock Holmes.

Christ in his songs and his tendency to
sing of such subjects as Heaven, Hell,
and Death. The many Old Testament
heroes also seem to appeal especially to
them and the way in which some of them
are worked into the songs is both humor-
ous and unique. Professor Lomax closed,
his entertainment by singing one of [these
negro folk-songs entitled, Lord, Remem-
ber Me._-This was, perhaps, the hit of
the evening and made a fitting climax to
a very pleasant and instructive lecture.

Dr. Treloar Wearn, ’18, who for the
past year has been an instructor at the
University of Pennsylvania will spend
this summer abroad. He expects to at-
tend a great international meeting in
Edinburg, Scotland where he will dem-
onstrate his work.

Doctor Wearn on his return to this
country will take up his work at Harvard
University as a member of the School of
Medicine.

The approaching Commencement of
Union Seminary, May 6-9, marks the
completion of twenty-five years since the
removal of the Seminary to Richmond,
and forty years of service by its beloved
President, Rev. Walter W. Moore, D. D.
Doctor Moore is one of the best loved
men in the Southern Presbyterian
Presbyterian Church, In scholarship, in
oratorical ability, and as a writer he is
among our leaders, and his influence on
the young men who have gone out from
Union into the ministry is beyond any
power of computation.
