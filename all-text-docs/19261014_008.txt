DRAMATIC CLUB CHANGES

committee for a trip this year. Heretofore,
no holidays have been granted them for mak-
ing an extended trip and the club has been
handicapped by this restriction.. Last year
three performances were staged on foreign
platforms, but these had to be worked in
between school hours. Performances were
shown at Queens College, Greensboro, and
Lexington. The sticcess of these perform-
ances inspired greater zeal into the club
members, and if their petition is granted, a
better schedule will be arranged: for the club
than ever before. The club will probably
present a one-act play on stunt night, No-
vember 13, i

There are at present about 12 active mem-
bers and about 35 associate members. Frank
Wilkinson has been elected president of the
Masquers; Prof. E. J. Erwin, director, and
J. B. Kuykendall, business manager,

Literary Societies

Philantropic

A proposed amendment to the con-
stitution of the Philanthropic society was
placed before the Judiciary Committee
on last Tuesday night. The proposed
amendment, which was introduced two
weeks ago and was tabled for two weeks,
provides for the reduction of freshman

possible by the excellent financial con-'|
dition of the society. At the last meet- |
ing, it was introduced again by Henry |
Powell, who did much to win the house |
for the amendment by his oratory. Aft- |
er a short discussion a vote was taken, |
and the count was unanimous for the |
amendment. |

The regular debate, resolved that Da-'
vidson should be made a co-educational
| school, was won by Powell and Brown, |

lon the affirmative, over Grady and Dixon |

| of the negative.

| L. K. Pritchett contributed greatly to|

| the program with a humorous imitation |
f the famous “Uncle‘Josh.” His num-

ber showed long and tedious prepara-|
tion.

Freshman Philanthropic

| The Philanthropic Freshmen are show-
ing steady improvement, and are taking |
a great interest in their literary society
work. Last Tuesday night the regular)
debate, “Resolved that the Court of con-|
trol.for the rule of freshmen should be
abolished,” was won by the affirmative. |
| Miller and Kennedy arguing for the af-|
| firmative against Best and Gant for the
négative. °

| The extemporaneous debate, resolved
|
|
|

|that mortar holds the brick together and
not apart, which was very interesting be-
|cause of its humor, received a negative |
‘decision, Wilson and Smith arguing for
the affirmative and negative respectively.
Pandeinic

| J. A. “Torchey” McAlpine opened the
| program of the Pandeinic Society Tues-
| day night, with an oration on “The Col-
| lege Men of Today.” In his oration, Mc-
| Alpine agreed with H. G. Wells in his
|charge that the collge men of today do
| not think.

| The regular debate, “Resolved that ad-
| ditional recreational instead of educa-
| tional facilities are needed at Davidson,”
| received a negative decison. Cox and
| Poag, on the affrmative, pointed to the
poor condition of the tennis courts, and
Golf Links, and the lack of Swimming
pool, Gymn equipment, and mass game
facilities. But Lapsley and Marsh, on the
negative, killed their argument by show-
ing that education was the main purpose
ofcolege anit should not give way to?
recreation,

Ed Beavers’ declamation, “Paul's De-|
fence Before Felix” was lent color by |
his excellent delivery; and the evidence |
of careful preparation. |

The officers elected one week ago will
be installed at the next meeting.

It very often happens that several Da-
vidson men become engaged im the same
work and even in the same firms. It is
especially interesting to ‘note that there
are five Davidson men who are with the
Metallurgical Co,, at the Niagara Falls
plant. J. M. Williams who has given
this information by letter states that his
permanent address will be 412 Fourth

Appleby Talks to
o Ministerial Band

The Ministerial Band held a brief ‘but
very inspiring service last Sunday after-
noon. C. G. Davis led in a song service
after which R. Turner read Romans 1:1-
17, Frew and Warren led in prayer.

C. F. McRae, in introducing the speak-
er, J. M. Appleby, secretary of the Y. M.
C. A., said that he was the friend of every
one on the Davidson campus, and was
well qualified for his work as secretary.

The speaker took his subject from
Romans 1:14, 16, “I am debtor both to

|the Greeks and to the Barbarians; both

to the wise and to the unwise.”

“In what way are we indebted to past
ages?” he asked. We are indebted to
them for the bare necessities of life, such
as our lighting system and improved
means of communication. Then for the
luxuries of life, for our law and educa-
tional systems we owe a great: obliga-
tion to ages past. i

This obligation faces every one of us
squarely and we must meet it by pre-
paring the way for ages yet unborn. We
will betray our trust if we fail in this
duty.

Man has more than this ethical re-

| sponsibility, for he is debtor to Christ

for all that He has done and suffered.
This debt can be paid by leading others
to Him, if, as a true Christian, “he is not
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.”

One million silver dollars were minted
in the United States during the month of

August. The “cart-wheels” are still popu-

lar in the West, although’ most Eastern-
ers refuse to carry them.

"190, whose address is the same as Wil-

liams’ is stationed in the Research Lab-
oratory Company. He was promoted
from the analytical laboratory. A. L.
Foscue, '20, is at present taking a student
course in the plant laboratory in order
to become one of the metallurgical en-
gineers. J. W. Norwood, ’26, is the last
Davidson recruit. He is one of the
chemists. On account of there being
