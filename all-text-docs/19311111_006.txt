(Continued from page 1)

He numbered Gideon's objections to leading |
the people as God commanded. Gideon first |
asked where were miracles to prove to him
that it was God. Dr. McSween believes that
God works His miracles today through the |
surrender of human lives,

In his opinion the greatest miracle on the |
march of the children of Istael from Egypt was |

Moses and the way he led the people. He as- |
serted that God created in Edison’s brain the |
idea of electricity and raised Wilson up to}
teach human brotherhood.

Gideon then asked for a sign from the Lord.
Dr. McSween pointed out that people now are
hard to convince just like Gideon, |

The third time Gideon said that God couldn't |
be calling him for such a great mission he- |
cause he was poor and of the smallest tribe. |
He continued that people ought to do what they |
can and let God use them the way He will. |
That it is necessary to stand alone, for “hero-
ism chooses loneliness rather than compromise.”
To emphasize his point; Dr. McSween gave an|
example and urged the students to be true to |
the standards learned at home and fostered at |
Davidson. He said that leaders are needed that |
rise above politics and selfishness, |

Finally, by way of ilustration, Dr. McSween |
showed that a man who didn’t heed the call was |
a failure in anything he undertakes, In con- |
cluding, his closing words were: “Go in the!
Strength of the Lord and you will make your |
Way prosperous and have good success,”

l hiked Chesterfield
right from the start”

‘s O, I don’t know a blessed thing
about how cigarettes are made. But,
of course, I would want the tobacco to
be PURE. And then I’ve heard that the
blending is very important. I’d want ¢Aat
to be done just right.
“Then the paper. I don’t like paper
that you can taste—or smell when it’s
burning. I’d want that pure téo. ;

“Another thing. I want to smoke when-
ever I feel like it—without worrying about
smoking too many. So I want my ciga-
rettes MILD. =

“But the main thing, of course, is
TASTE. I don’t care for over-sweet-
ened cigarettes. I much prefer those that
are just sweet enough.

“Chesterfield seems to satisfy in every
one of these ways. That is why I’d rather
have a Chesterfield.”

© 1931, Liccurr & Mygrs Tosacco Co.

SMOKERS tire of too much sweetness
in a cigarette, and they don’t like rawness.
For a steady diet, they want a Cigarette
like CHESTERFIELD — a mild and mel-
low smoke, free from any over-sweetness
or any harshness or bitterness, That's
why more and more smokers every day
are changing to CHESTERFIELD.
Good ... they’ve got to be good.

Moore prayed, Mrs. G. R. Vowles sang a so-|
lection, accompanied by Miss Hattie Thompson |
at the piano. Dr. H. M. Moffett gave the dis-
missal prayer at the close of the program.

BETAS DEFEAT PHI GAMMS
(Continued from page 4)

The Phi Gamm backs worked well as a unit
and as a result it will be rather difficult to
select any particular outstanding | player. It |
might be said, however, that “Rip” Montgorh- |
“ery tossed several beautiful passes and Joe.
Tyack frequently broke loose on lengthy gal- |
lops. Chuck Wright also executed some ane |
blocking. In the Phi Gamm line Billy North- |
ern and Bill Brown played stellar games. |
