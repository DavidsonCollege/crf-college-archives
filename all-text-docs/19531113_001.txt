Fraternities S

12 Fall Functions

This weekend will set off the
round of annual fall fraternity
dances, banquets, suppers and
masquerades, whicz will be held
in various places on weekends
from now until the Christmas holi-
days.

Everything from gangsters to
French peasants are to be the
themes of the various masquerades
and formality will reach both ex-
tremes before the season is over.
At least six different banquet
halls will be used by the different
fraternities.

The Kappa Alphas will open the
social season with their semi-
formal banquet and dance at the
Red Fez Club Saturday night. A
local orchestra will provide music,
and entertainment will be in
charge of the pledge class.

Several fraternities will hold
their functions November 21.

The Sigma Chis will deck them-
selves out as French peasants for
a banquet and dance.

The ATO’s banquet and dance
will be at the Policeman's Club in
Charlotte, and members will come
dressed as gangsters. Charlie
Friar’s orchestra will supply music
and pledges will entertain.

The Kappa Sigs, a little more
on the serious side, will have their
annual Black and White Ball.

The Campus Club on this same
weekend will have a hayride and
supper.

On December 5, the Phi Gams

will have dinner at Kuester’s in
Charlotte, and then will have a
formal pledge dance in the ball-
room of the Barringer Hotel.

Ray Barrier and his orchestra
will provide the Phi Delts with
music for their Suppressed Desire
masquerade ball and banquet at
the El Morroco Club. The SPEs
will have an informal banquet-
dance at the Policeman’s Club.

The Pi Kappa Phis will have
their annual Founder’s Day Ball,
which will be a formal dinner and
dance, at the Selwyn Hotel. A
pledge skit will provide entertain-
ment, and the naming of the Fra-
ternity Rose will highlight the eve-
ning.

Away from Charlotte, the Bi
Kappa Alphas will have a mas-
querade bali and buffet supper
at the VFW Hut in Mooresville.
Highlight of the evening will be
presentation of paddies by the
pledges to the senior brothers.

The SAEs will have a costume
ball, banquet and dance, at the
Selwyn Hotel.

Plans by the Betas are still in-
complete, but the party will prob-
ably be held during the first weeks
in December.

Several of the fraternities still
have some details to complete be-
fore their weekends, but this year’s
variety and plans appear to add
up to an exceptionally bright social
season for the fraternities at Da-
vidson.

Deadline Extended (COLLEGE PERSONNEL

For Frosh Contest

Scripts 'n Pranks will make its
next appearance during the first
week in January, announced Edi-
tor Alden Williams today, adding
that the deadline for the Fresh-
man Prose Writing contest has
been extended two weeks until
November 23.

“For purposes of definition,”
Williams said, “the second issue
will present a somewhat more
serious approach, and we hope will
be an example of the finest type
of college fiction being written
today.”

The winning freshman entry will
be judged by the editorial staff
of the magazine, and will be a
feature of the January issue.

Commenting on the manuscripts

received so far, the editor praised
the work of the more than a dozen
contributors, and expressed hope
that the deadline extension would
yield a similarly encouraging re-
turn.
“At the same time,” he stated,
“may I urge upperclassman writers
—not only in prose fiction and
non-fiction, but also in plays and
poetry—to let their work be known
to one of the editors.

“It is high time that the under-
graduate writers here stop hiding
their candles under curricular
bushels. We needn't play second
fiddle to any school in this field.”

Freshman contest entries or up-
perclassmen’s manuscripts may be
turned in at the office.

AID BIBLE SPEAKER

Davidson College organizations
and personnel have largely con-
tributed to the success of the an-
nual Ashlin White Bible Lectures
this week at the First Presbyterian
Church in Mooresville. The Rev-
erend Thomas Allan from Glasgow,
Scotland, has been this year’s out-
standing lecturer.

The Davidson College Chapel
Choir under the direction of Mr.
Donald B. Plott with Herbert Rus-
sell as accompanist, presented a
quarter hour of sacred music by
English composers. The choir made
a hit with the congregation and
particularly Mr. Allan who compli-
mented them highly, and thanked
Mr. Plott and Mr. Russell for the
inclusion of a “night of beautiful
English music.”

Thornwell J. Frick, represented
the Davidson College Male Chorus,
as soloist on Thursday night's musi-
cal program, singing Scott’s “Re-
pent Ye!”

The Reverend Samuel Newell
was the guest minister participat-
ing in the “Davidson College
Night” on Tuesday at the lectures.

Mr. Allan was tremendously im-
pressed by the beauty of David-
son’s campus, the wonderful re-
ception and response by the stu-
dent body, the majestic, simple
beauty of the new church, and
stated to Tuesday night’s congrega-
tion that “the men of Davidson
... are the future leaders in our
great cause of Christianity”

DR. CALVIN G. DAVIS
10 SPEAK SUNDAY

The Vespers speaker for this Sun-
day, Calvin G. Davis, Th. D., D.D.,
is not only an alumnus of David-
son, but also one of its trustees.
Born in Wilmar, Arkansas in 1906,
he began his higher education at
Hendrix College. Entering David-
son in 1924, Dr. Davis was a stu-
dent here until receiving his A.B.
degree in 1927.

Princeton Theological Seminary
was next, followed by the Union
Theological Seminary, where he
received his B.D., Th. M., and
Th. D.

Dr. Davis began his career as a
minister when he served as as-
sistant pastor at the Grace Cove-
nant Presbyterian Church, Rich-
mond, Va., in 1931, and continued
there until 1933. Until 1938, he
was pastor of the Second Presby-
terian Church in Norfolk, when he
moved to Asheville, N.C., to be-
come pastor of the First Presby-
terian Church there. He was mar-
ried during his stay in Norfolk,
and now has two sons.

Not only Davidson; but Montreat
College and King College benefit
from his services in the capacity
of trustee. In addition, he is presi-
dent of the Ministers’ Association,
director of the Community Chest,
and was. Moderator of the Synod
of Appalachia in 1952 and the
Asheville Presbytery in 1939.

In recognition of the fine serv-
ice rendered by this man, both
Davidson and Tusculum College
awarded him Doctor of Divinity
degrees in 1943.

Union Movie Stars
Radford, Seton, Lacy

“Tight Little Island,” is the
movie to be shown on Saturday in
the College Union, with two fea-
tures beginning at 7:00 and 9:00
p.m.

It is a very funny English film
which depicts the wartime suffer-
ings of a community of Scots when
the famous oil product of the coun-
try is cut off. By luck, a ship
burdened with many cases of this
product is presently wrecked off
the shores of this dry island.

The picture from here on oc-
cupies itself with efforts to frus-
trate officials, none of whom un-
derstand the situation, into ob-
taining the pleasures this product
has to offer. They finally wind up
where they started—even after
having success in getting it.

The cast includes Basil Radford,
Catherine Lacey, Broce Seton and
Joan Greenwood.

The display of diplomas recently being shown in the Union _

gives the present diploma at the top left. Below it is @ copy of
Davidson's original diploma, with a diploma of the classes pre-
vious to 1930 to its right. At top right is the more compact pro-
posed diploma, made to resemble the original, end offered this
year if two-thirds of the members of the upper classes yote for it.

STUDENTS TO VOTE ON
HOT DIPLOMA ISSUE

Immediately following Monday’s Chapel services there
will be an important meeting of the upper three classes to
decide the type of diploma to be received by graduating
classes for the next five years. A two-thirds majority of the
total membership will be necessary to change from the

present type.

In otder for these seniors, juniors, and sophomores to
come to a decision about which type to vote for, it is sug-
gested that each one go by the College Union and look at
the display there. There are four different types of di-
plomas shown, and from these one will be chosen Monday.

One of these is an original diploma, given to a mem-

ber of the graduating class

of 1840. Another is one re-

*ceived by a student graduating in 1929, the last year in
whicn this type was used. There would be an increase in

‘cost over the present type if either of those two were used.

The third is the type given at present, begun in 1930.
And there is a new type of diploma which is an artist’s
conception of the diploma of 1840-1929. This one is the
same size as the present 1930 diploma and would cost no
more than the present type of diploma.

Charlie Johnson, president of the senior class, has led
the move to change the diploma and it was he with Buddy
Lamon, also of the senior class, who went before the Execu-
tive Committee last Wednesday, November 4, to present

the proposal.

The question has attracted the attention of a number
of writers on this week’s editorial page, and there are
representative views from both camps—the advocates and

the opposition.

Soon after the voting on Monday, a decision will be
announced and the matter finally decided by the vote.

incoming members for the first
time Tuesday night at the home
of Prof. A. V. Goldiere.

Norman Johnson, the incoming
president, presided. Fred Summers,
vice president; Gregory Dimijian,
secretary, and Prof. Goldiere,
treasurer round out the 1953-1954
slate of officers.

As Frosh Parent Day

It was announced Wednesday
that Saturday, November 21, will
be Freshman Parents’ Day. The
parents of all freshmen have been
sent a letter by Max Devane, fresh-
man adviser, inviting them to visit
the school on that day.

A full schedule of events has
been planned for the visitors. In
the morning they will register and
go on informal tours of the cam-
pus. From eleven to twelve there
will be a conference in the Union
with Dean Bailey and other col-
lege officials on problems confront-
ing freshmen. Following a dinner
in the cafeteria, the parents will
attend the Davidson-Citadel foot-

College officials state that they
hope as many parents as possible
will take advantage of this op-
portunity to visit the campus, meet
members of the faculty, and make
the acquaintance of their son’s
friends and their parents.

Due to the lack of accommoda-
tions in Davidson, students whose
parents plan to stay overnight are
advised to find places for them in
Charlotte or other nearby towns.

TO PRESENT PROJECTS

By MAURICE CROUSE

The YMCA Gift Fund Commit-
tee will present to the student
body on Thursday in chapel three
projects for consideration. Leigh-
ton McCutchen will present all of
them and will explain the needs
and merits of each.

One of the three will be selected
by the students as the Gift Fund
project for this year, and al! the
money raised will go to that
project. The goal for the fund will
be announced after the selection,
so that financial need will not be
a factor.

The projects were chosen by
the YMCA Cabinet from several
which were suggested and con-
sidered. A community committee
composed of Dr. and Mrs. W. P.
Cumming, D. Grier Martin, Dr.
J. M. Bevan, the Reverend Sam
Newell, and Sam Magill investi-
gated the local project.

Each one of the three projects
is different in.its scope and na-
ture, one being local, one being
state, and the third international
in scope.

Aid Local Community

The local project suggested by
the YMCA is the moving and re-
pair of the YMCA Hut in the Ne-
gro community of Davidson. The
hut, built over 10 years ago, is now
located on the Negro School
grounds and must be moved to a
new lot. It also needs considera-
ble repair work.

The lack of recreational facili-
ties in. the Davidson Negro com-
munity is great, and some of the
money would go for the purchase
of a piano, a motion picture pro-
jector and screen, and other such
recreational equipment.

Any surplus which might be left
after the moving of the hut and
purchase of the recreational
equipment would be used for fu-
ture maintenance of the hut. This
project would provide an oppor-
tunity for Christian service here
in the town of Davidson.

Help to Glade Valley

The state project suggested con-
cerns the Glade Valley School. Lo-
cated northwest of Statesville, this
high school was founded in 1911
for the education of boys and girls
in Alleghany, Ashe, Stokes, Surry,
and Wilkes counties.

The school is now under the
care of the Orange and Winston-
Salem Presbyteries and receives
some financial support from them.
Other income is from Sunday
School and church gifts, gifts from
individuals, sales of products made
at the school, and tuition. The
school budget is quite small.

Recently the boy’s dormitory
burned, leaving the school with-
out full facilities, and a campaign
is now under way to raise funds
for rebuilding. The Davidson con-
tribution would go into this build-
ing fund if the project is selected.

Hospital in Portugal

The third project, the Protestant
hospital in Portugal, is interna-
tional in its scope. Protestants are
the minority in Portgual and suf-

Bevan Talks to Phi;

Chan je Constitution

An interesting speech by Dr.
J. M. Bevan of the Psychology De-
partment was the highlight of the
meeting of the Philanthropic Lit-
erary Society this past Monday
night. Dr. Bevan's topic was
“Spiritualism and Seances.”

During the business meeting, at
which President Bob Crutchfield
presided, the organization adopted
a new constitution to replace the
original one which was adopted
in 1893.

A regular meeting will be held
Monday night, November 16.

EUMANEAN SOCIETY
INITIATES MEMBERS

At the meeting Monday night
of the Eumanean Literary Society,
three prospective members—Char-
lie Lambert, Gilbert Gragg and
Fred Myers read papers. Four other
papers were submitted to be read
later.

With President Will Terry pre-
siding, there was a brief discussion
of the various plans for a change
in the school diploma.

Extensive Counselling Is

Offered To All D.C. Men

By SWAIN LOY

During the past spring and sum-
mer, the college carried out an
expansion program for the student
counseling and guidance aspect of
the school’s facilities. This program
had long been in the making but
just this past year was it put into
effect.

This expansion of facilities and
scope of the student guidance
work has been for the most part
completed, according to Dr. Ost-
walt, the director.

In a tour of the facilities now
ready for use on the second floor
in the north end of Chambers, Dr.
Ostwalt pointed out the personal
interview room and secretary’s of-
fice, a classroom which is used for
administering tests and classes, a
reading room which contains in-
formation about nearly every type
vocation a person could be interest-
ed in, Dr. Ostwalt’s office, a test

supply room equipped with a good
stock of varied tests, and one
other room which has not yet been
completed but will soon add a
great deal to the effectiveness of
the program. These expanded fa-
cilities offer a fuller counseling
program for the students.

Varied Counseling

The Student Counseling Depart-
ment has been provided for the
students to satisfy many needs
heretofore neglected. In addition
to the more evident needs for
counseling such as academic fail-
ure and difficult emotional prob-
lems, this guidance ‘center offers
a great deal of help for minor
troubles in studies, minor emo-
tional difficulties, and vocational
guidance.

For students who wish to im-
prove the quality of their work
by eliminating specific academic
deficiencies in such subject mat-

ter fields as mathematics, English,
and reading, there are ample op-
portunities in the counseling pro-
gram to aid them. Tests can be
administered and interpreted to
aid the student in choosing a vo-
ction, and also interviews with a
trained advisor may be arranged.
Thus the three problems are met—
the academic, the vocational, and
the personal.
Procodure

The procedure for taking ad-
vantage of these services is simple.
First the student contacts the
counseling office and presents the
problem in which he desires aid.
After the initial interview it, is
decided if, what, and how many
tests are to be administered in the
case. The tests are given; those
for vocational guidance being cost
free. These tests are checked and
interpreted and then in another
interview the student is given the

é

results, and these are discussed to-
ward a possible solution to the
problem.

When this procedure is com-
pleted the case may be terminated;
however, should there be more
work to be done on the problem,
follow-up interviews are held.
There may be more tests admin-
istered and interpreted. There also
might be some remedial work
done, especially in the case of
academic troubles.

This department of the school’s
work can and should be used by
many more students than are now
taking advantage of the depart-
ment’s facilities. Whereas in the
past the work was fairly limited,
the scope of the work of the Stu-
dent Counseling Department has
been so enlarged that it might
more adequately fill the needs of

more students.
