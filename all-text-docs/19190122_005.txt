‘The DAVIDSONIAN, January 22, 1919

The Friendly Spirit
On Davidson Campus

“Who Is My Neighbor?” Subject At
Weekly “Y” Meeting.

In his talk before the Y. M. C. A.
Sunday afternoon, Mr. Miles chose as
his subject. ‘Who Is My Neighbor?”
“This Parable of the Good Samaritan,
so well know to us all,” said Mr, Miles
in beginning, “is so often forgotten.”
“And this question, ‘Who is my neigh-
bor,’ is.” declared the speaker, “one that
concerns us much,” As a specific in-
stance he pointed out how unneighborli-
hess among the peoples of Europe had
resulted in the big European. avar.  Ser-
bia, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and
Turkey, all hated each other. Russia
hated Austria, and Austria hated Ser-
bia, France hated Germany. “These
countries did not look upon the peoples

of foreign states as their neighbors. To-
day a great Peace Congress sits in

France to determine “Who is my neigh-
bor” and what action should be taken
towards him.

Mr. Miles said that. if the teachings
of Jesus be summarized, it might be call-
ed “How to dies” and that the method
would he called “Love.” Christ com-
manded, “Love thy neighbor as thy-
self.” Mr. Miles declared that the capi-
talized personal pronoun “1” must. be
transfornied into the personal pronoun
“You,” “And.” he. continued. “every
man on Davidson campus is your neigh-
bor.” It behooves wll to make it a point
to be ‘friendly. It is a thing we owe to
the other fellow. My neighbor on Da-
vidson campus is not strictly the fellow
in my fraternity, or my literary society.
but every man here.” he said. Mr.
Miles pointed out several ways in whicn
neighborliness might be shown,

In the first place. “Speak to every
man on the campus.” Mr. Miles said
that this has always been a splendid cus:
tom at Davidson. It means much to
say just a word of greeting as you’ pass
a fellow on the college walks.

Again, upperclassmen should treat the
Freshmen in that spirit, “As ve would
that others should do to you." ‘The up-
perclassmen can each recall the friendly
acts or words of some older fellow by
whom they happened to be befriended
their first year. “Khe Freshman is -hu-
man, and appreciates, kindness. “Fhe
upperclassman owes it to the Freshman.

Mr. Miles closed with a plea for
zreater friendliness :tnd co-operation
among the fellows on the campus. “Be
loyal to your college first. then loyal
to the literary society,
class. Have the spirit of friendliness,”
he said.

MARGARITE CLARK AND
ALICE JOYCE VISIT Y BLDG.

‘The movies have come to Davidson.
and come to stay. ‘Tuesday, the 14th.
the gymnasium was filled with a happy
crowd, gathered to see the first show.
As the pictures appeared upon the screen
shouts and laughter rent the air, ‘Phe
Halfback” and “Gallepher™ were much
appreciated. In the intervals between
reels A, P. Ormond rendered several
selections upon the piano, On ‘Thurs-
day night “The Amazons,” with Miar-
parite Clarke, scored a tremendous hit.
The picture was. full of “dramatic” situ-
ations which were applauded enthusias-
tically, “Two more enjoyable | shows
were given on Saturday and “Tuesday,
one of which featured Alice Joyce.

At the first show, the operators had a
little trouble with the machine. How-
ever, the house was expecting some
trouble, and it did not lessen their en-
jovment. Experience broaght wisdom,
and Rogers, ‘22, and Bernau, °21, suc-
ceeded in putting “The Amazons”
across with only one accident! They
put the third reel in) backwards, and
when the writing appeared, a howl
arose. “The operators. are improving.
And, before you know it, the movies
here will be as good as any in the State.
and the best part, is that they are free to
all.

After the first of February the movies
will he on Vuesday and Saturday nights.
On “Tuesdays the hour is 6:45, en Sat-
urdays, $:30: Of course if a basketball
game is scheduled for Saturday night
the movie hour will be changed. “This
will probably be necessary only twe or
three times in the whole year. tn the
meantime, before February, the show
will be held Tuesday and Friday at 6:45
pom. Mr. Miles expects to follow the
ahove schedule as far as possible.

B. E. Shields and W. ML. Scart, at
piano and drum, add much to the en-
jovment of the pictures by their stirring
music,
