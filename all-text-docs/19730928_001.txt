Two Governance Systems Considered

AN ANALYSIS

By TODD EADES
Associate Editor

In moving towards a new
governance system, discussion
of general structures and
specific proposals is needed.
Essentially, two governmental
systems are under con-
sideration: an area delegation
system and a college assembly
system.

The present system is
basically one of area
delegation. Dr. Spencer, in his
Convocation address, suggested
that a college assembly system
of some type might be ad-
vantageous.

In an area delegation system

powers are delegated by the
trustees to various groups to

act in specific fields. This
system is extremely flexible,
allowing varying degrees of
operational and policy control
in each area for the several

groups. ;

However. the area delegation
system generally involves ad-
ministrative hegemony in most
areas, shang Gis ies greta’
of Davidson’s experience and
is not inherent in the system.

A college assembly system
accomplishes the sharing of
authority among’ groups

representation in a
general legislative-type assem-
bly.

In theory, this assembly has
virtually full operational and
policy control. In practice,
various graduations of assem-
bly authority are possible. In
both systems, the Board of

Trustees possess ultimate
authority.

Model I is a synthesis of the
two systems, but is primarily
an area delegation model with a
faculty-dominated assembly of
limited powers.

This assembly consists of all
teaching faculty, nine ad-
ministrators, and 20 adjunct
student members. The
President presides over the
assembly, although the Faculty
elects a Chairman protempore.

Executive session of the
assembly excludes student par-
ticipation. Petition to the
trustees is permitted by three-
— vote of the entire assem-

y.

For simplicity, only five
major areas of concern will be
discussed: Fiscal, Personnel,
and Development Affairs,

he

Vol. LXIII, No. Three

Educational Policy and
Program, Admissions,
Athletics, and Campus Life.

The assembly has primary
responsibility in the two areas
of Educational Policy and Ad-
missions. Legislative com-
mittees of the assembly,
chaired by administrators, ad-
vise the assembly, which is the
decision-making body.

The President may submit
any assembly decision to the
trustees for review and deny
implementation for three mon-
ths.

The other three areas are the
primary responsibility of the
president. Advisory Councils in
the areas receive major
Presidential proposals to the
Trustees for perusal, and may
submit to the trustees a
majority dissent.

College Committee
To Formulate

Recommendations

By ALEC HOON
Editor-in-Chief

On Wednesday, Oct. 3 in Mon-
treat, N.C. the combined
Trustee-Faculty Committee on
Athletics will meet to discuss
and approve recommendations
for the Davidson Atheltic
Program, to be presented to the
full meeting of the Board of
Trustees on Oct. 26.

As of Tuesday,
some concern over whether the
Trustee Committee would meet
in closed session, without either
faculty or student members
of the faculty committee on
athletics present.

On Wednesday, College
President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. denied that there would be
any exclusion saying, ‘The
faculty committee on athletics
may send either represen-
tatives or all of its members to
the committee meeting in Mon-
treat.”

The chairman of the faculty
athletic committee, Vice-
President for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan announced that
there would be a meeting on
Oct. 1 of his committee to
decide what their recom-
mendations for the joint
meeting on Wednesday would
be.

“I have asked each member,
student and faculty, to prepare
a position paper on athletics
which will be read at the
meeting on Monday. After these
papers are read, we will try to
get a consensus opinion of the
committee,’’ Bevan stated.

The combined meeting in
Montreat is to prepare specific
recommendations on athletics
for Trustee approval. The
recommendations will be along
the lines of those delivered by

in his address last
Friday at Convocation. (see
Highlights Box, page 1)

Included in the Spencer
speech was the announcement
that future football scholarships
would be based almost ex-
clusively on need.

there was'

This means that when a
scholarship is given to a football
player, if any part of this
scholarship comes in the from
of a job or loan, the Wildcat club
will pay that part so that the
player will not have to work or
repay the loan.

Spencer also indicated that
the maximum number of foot-
ball players who could receive
scholarships would be made by
the administration with the help
of the faculty committee on
athletics.

Bevan said that this number
would probably be somewhere
between 60 and 75. He also said
that such scholarship costs
would be considerably less than
the amount the college is
presently spending on scholar-
ships.

Davidson

By PHILLIP BISHOP

More than 6000 students ap-
plied this year for 89 seats in
Wake Forest's Bowman-Gray
Medical School. The average
grade point average of the class
entering Duke University
Medical School this fall was
3.55.

What chance do Davidson
graduates stand in the cutthroat
competition for places in the
nation’s professional and
graduate schools?

Probably as good as ever,
claimed Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan.

“Statistically speaking, we
are doing well in maintaining
Davidson's excellent record of
professional school  ad-
missions,’’ said Bevan.

“Davidson has a tradition
which is undefinable, but as
meaningful as anything else”’ in
the evaluation of an un-
dergraduate for admission.

But now is no time for David-
son to rest on its laurels. Other,

EXPLAINING POLICY
President Spencer discusses athletic meeting.

Advisory Councils are com-
posed of varying of
administrators, faculty and
students.

In Model | Trustee revision of
policy and program decisions is
carefully maintained by formal
mechanisms. Administration
hegemony is produced by em-
phasis on administrative in-
itiative and by administrative
chairmen of both the assembly
and its major legislative com-
mittees.

The Faculty proposal, Model
II, is also a combination of the
two systems, but maintains a
greater degree of Faculty
autonomy and establishes a
new advisory body in the
College Conference.

Compared to Model I, the
Faculty proposal decreases ad-
ministrative hegemony in
policy making and distributes
this responsibility to the
Faculty.

A brief description of this new
system is unavoidable. The
Faculty and the SGA retain
their basic integrity as distinct
groups. In areas of shared con-
cern, both groups will establish
Conference Committees which
also confer with each other.

The College Conference is
composed of faculty and
student chairmen of the Con-
ference committees and ad-
ditionally, ten faculty, ten
students, five administrators,
and two trustees.

The Conference has no
powers beyond recommending
action to the Faculty, the SGA,
the administration, and the
Trustees. It elects its own chair-
man.

The Faculty consists of those
who teach half-time or more,
the President, the two Vice-
Presidents, the Dean of Studen-
ts, and five other ad-
ministrators who are non-
voting members.

The SGA President is invited
to attend Faculty meetings. A
Faculty Chairman pro-tempore
is elected from the teaching
faculty. The President presides
at Faculty meetings.

By a majority vote of the total
membership, the trustees may
be petitioned for direct action
concerning any matter sub-
stantially affecting the fun-
damental interests of the
college.

Mystique Aids Post-Graduates

schools are aggressively im-
proving their faculties and are
better preparing their students
for graduate study, Bevan poin-
ted out.

To keep Davidson ahead in
the race for professional school
admissions, faculty and ad-
ministrators have embarked on
an effort to improve the pre-
professional programs, he said.

Bevan emphasized _ the
College Conference Schedule,
slated for Oct. 10 and 17, as an
important step in that effort.

“‘On the afternoon of October
17, pre-meds and other pre-
professional students will meet
with professionals - doctors,
lawyers, etc. - from outside the
college,’’ Bevan explained.

In addition, each student will
be assigned that day to an ad-
visor, Bevan said. He stated
that this would prevent
overloading any one advisor
and would make possible closer
supervision of pre-professional
students.

Another _ pre-professional

curriculum is being added to
the traditional pre-med, pre-
law and pre-ministerial studies,
Bevan noted.

A pre-managerial program,
to be headed by Economics
Professor Charles E. Ratliff.
could include ‘‘just about every-
body’’ who does not go on to
graduate school, including
candidates for jobs in banking,
public affairs and business,

according to Bevan.
Improving programs at
Davidson is not the only way to

insure a sympathetic ear in ad-
missions offices at Duke or Har-
_vard or Princeton. Bevan said

thathe wasawareof theneed for |

good public relations with
professional schools.

“With funds from my office,
we sent professors to talk with
almost a dozen law school this
summer,’ he noted.

“Also, having Davidson
graduates already at these
schools or on their faculties
sometimes means a lot to a
Davidson applicant,’’ Bevan ad-
ded.

Does a Davidson graduate
still have an edge on most of the
students clamoring for ad-
mission to Americas profes-
sional schools?

“A sort of mystique is still
there. Yes, Davidson still has a
good record of graduate ad-
missions,”’ replied Bevan.

LOCK UP

Director of the Honors
Center, Earl MacCormac
announced this week that the
Center would be locked up at
11 p.m. instead of midnight
as announced last week.

MacCormac stated that
the problems of vandals and
student abuse last year
would be solved by the
closing. He said that the
security force's schedule
necessitated the one hour
change.

Phil Hall, open all night
long last year, will also close
at 11 p.m. for similar
reasons.
