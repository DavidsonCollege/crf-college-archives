I was planning on writing a
deep and meaningful article about
the nature of music, but my head
hurts, and I’m looking at the long-
est possible walk on campus: the
Union to the senior apartments.
Therefore, I will present to you a
version of some of the top albums
in rock and roll history, in my
opinion. In no particular chrono-

logical order:

Sgt. Peppers’s: I grudgingly put
the Beatles on the list, but their
enormous influence cannot be ig-
nored. Besides, any album that
Hendrix learned to play in one day
has to have something to it.

Dark Side of the Moon: One of
the most laboriously produced al-

bums ever, Dark Side is Pink Floyd
at their zenith. With the single
theme of insanity driving the mu-
sic, each song makes astrong state-
ment about the troubled state of
humanity. Some of the best lyrical
writing ever.

ing that they could not top this

Southern Renaissance man

By George Weld

If nothing else, Mark Richard
(pronounced, the jacket of his first
book tells us, “in the French man-
ner’”’) has the most interesting book-
jacket biography of any serious
writer of fiction. In addition to
having had a luminous beginning
as a fiction writer, Richard has

apparently worked as a bartender,
a teacher, a reporter, acommercial
fisherman, a disc jockey, and a
private investigator. His is the
biography of a white-trash Renais-
sance man, the well-rounded child
of Hemingway and Dorothy
Allison. More recently—and, per-
haps, more importantly—

Richard’s life has been dominated
by fiction and gilded with many
awards and much praise. In 1990,
he was awarded the PEN/

Hemingway award for his collec- ¢

COOKING WITH RACHEL

Miove over, Carnivores

Rachel has recipes to tempt vegetarian tummies

By Rachel Newcomb

Last week I wrote about how
to make Greek Feta Chicken. I
was both surprised and pleased at
how many people told me they
tried to make this dish in their
apartments. If you tried, I hope
you'were successful. All of these
recipes have been tested by me.

This week I have two vegetar-
ian dishes that are both quite fill-
ing. One is herbed couscous with
vegetables, a delicately subtle side
dish that borrows from Moroccan
culture. Couscous is a grain avail-
able in the special foods section of
Harris Teeter. The other dish is
tomato and basil pasta, which is
extremely easy and looks beautiful
ona plate. Both of these dishes are
. delicious.

Please let me know if you try
any of these recipes, and feel free
to call me at -6629 if you have any
questions on preparation. Enjoy!

Herbed Couscous & Vegetables
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms

1 Tblsp. margarine

1 cup water

1 Tbisp. snipped fresh parsley
1/2 tsp. dried basil

1/4 tsp. salt

1/8 tsp. dried oregano

Dash pepper

- 2/3 cup couscous (available in
Harris Teeter)

1 medium tomato, chopped

In a medium saucepan, cook
mushrooms in hot margarine till
tender. Carefully add water to
saucepan. Stir in parsley, basil,
salt, oregano & pepper. Bring to
boiling; remove from heat. Stir in

couscous. Let stand, covered, for5S:

minutes. Stir in tomato. Makes 4
servings. ‘

Tomato & Basil Pasta
4 large chopped tomatoes (or sev-
eral equivalent small ones)

1 large garlic clove

1 lb. of spaghetti or fettucine
noodles

6 fresh basil leaves (available at
Harris Teeter)

8 ounces mozzarella, cut into cubes

(Gouda or Edam may be substi-
tuted)

1 Tblsp. olive oil

Salt & Pepper to taste

Begin to cook the noodles ac-
cording ‘to package directions.

Mince the garlic clove into tiny
pieces. Fry on medium until
slightly brown in the olive oil. Add
the chopped tomatoes and the basil
and stir until slightly cooked, about
three to five minutes. Salt and
pepper to taste. Set aside. When
the pasta is ready, remove the basil
leaves from the tomatoes. Drain
the pasta and add the tomato mix-
ture and cubed cheese. The cheese
should melt nicely among the hot
noodles and tomatoes.

attention away from the other
weaknesses. But on most of Mon-
ster his voice wallows in the back
of the mix, far below Peter Buck’s
wildly creative but sonically over-
powering guitars.

Though the album disappoints
onsome occasions, Monster still is
a good album. Though they may
hate to admit it; R.E.M. hits its
collective stride during the mellow
songs that inhabit the album’s
middle. “Tongue,” a piano-based,
falcetto-blessed number, more re-
sembles Prince or Marvin Gaye
than the jangle rock R.E.M. is
known for, especially with such
sexually frank lines as, “Ugly girls
know their fate / Anybody can get
laid.” Such is indicative of most of
Michael Stipe’s contribution —
his lyrics are more daring than
ever, yet most of them are impos-
sible to hear. Like the Wizard of
Oz, he tries to simultaneously ex-
press himself as the human being
he is and the giant he’s become in
public. Contradictions within lyr-
ics abound: “I am expensive / I’m

the real thing / Won’t you be my
valentine? (from “Crush with
Eyeliner).”

Stipe and Buck, who cre-
atively dominate the album, pull
out all the stops to glorious ends on
“Let Me In.” Onstensibly a tribute
to Kurt Cobain, to whom Stipe had
become a mentor and friend, “Let
Me In” starts and ends as a wall of
reverberating guitars, only occa-
sionally supplemented by Bill
Berry’s tambourine and Mike
Mills’ gorgeously mournful organ.
Barely understandable in the wash,
Stipe’s voice pulls off the seem-
ingly impossible task of sounding
simultaneously detached and in-

volved. In short, he sounds se-".

verely depressed, a fitting state
when considering who was in mind
when he wrote the lyrics: “I had 4
mind to try and stop you / Let me
in, let me in.” This stange and sad
elegy stands above the rest as the
album’s classic, much as “World
Leader Pretend” did for Green.
“Let Me In” alone redeems what is
a mediocre album only in the com-
pany of the ‘R.E.M. catalog.

company after its release. Fueled
by Sting’s uncanny songwriting

Led Zeppelin II: It’s hard to

I'll put two. This album contains

Film Review

Whoopi Goldberg's latest:
predictable but entertaining

By Tammy Tiska

In Corrina, Corrina, Whoopi
Goldberg returns to the role of a
black domestic working in a white
household (previously in Clara’s
Heart and The Long Walk Home)
in this tale of unexpected love set
in 1950’s suburbia. Ray Liotta
plays Manny Singer, a recently
widowed father who is searching
for a housekeeper to look after his
six year old daughter, Molly (Tina
Marjorino).

The opening scene is the day
of Mrs. Singer’s funeral, shot from
the perspective of Molly. This is a
somewhat risky way to begin a
movie, because I was immediately
distanced from the emotional ex-
perience of the characters, never
having even been introduced tothe
deceased character. However,
when the story was told from
Molly’s viewpoint, it was poignant
and surprising. When delivery men
arrive at the door with a couch that
Mrs. Singer had ordered, a flus-
tered Manny says, “She’s in the
bathtub.” On hearing this, Molly
rushes to the bathroom and flings
open the door, only to find the
bathtub empty. She climbs in any-
way.
Unfortunately, the second half
of the movie focuses less on Molly
and her journey through grief in

favor of the romantic subplot be-
tween Manny and Corrina. This
part of the movie was enjoyable
but predictable, with Manny’s Jew-
ish mother telling him, “A fish and
a bird can fall in love, but where
will they build their nest?” Only
perfunctory attention is paid to the
social ramifications of Manny and
Corrina’s interracial relationship.

All the 50's paraphanalia and
the stylized portrayal of life in sub-
urbia sometimes made me feel like
I was watching this movie through
a plastic windshield, but maybe
that’s what life was like for people
trapped in the suburban nightmare
of nosy neighbors and television
dinners.

Anna Paquin (The Piano) has
nothing on Tina Marjorino (When
a Man Loves a Woman, Andre),
who even makes Goldberg fade
into the orange and green wallpa-
per attimes. Corrina, Corrina also
includes some hilarious moments
between Corrina’s relatives and
Molly as well as some fabulous
musical selections. The most satis-
fying aspect of this movie was
Molly’s evolution from confusion
over her mother’s death to an un-
derstanding—simple as it is—that
allows her to once again experi-
ence the peculiar joys of child-
hood.

Music Review

Natural Born Killers CD

By John Copenhaver

A couple of weeks ago I de-
cided that I would pick up the
Natural Born Killers soundtrack
after hearing that it was produced
by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails
and that it included songs from
Peter Gabriel, the Cowboy Junkies
and of course, Nine Inch Nails. I
noticed the tracks were not listed

-on the outside cover, but I went

ahead and bought it anyway. After
listening to the first five tracks I
knew this was going to be some-
thing quite unique.

“Waiting for the Miracle” by
Leonard Cohen starts the album
out quietly and mysteriously, but
the second song by L7 bursts out
violently. This disturbing contrast

sets the mood of the album. As jit _

progresses though each of the 27
songs, the album is hit with waves
of violence and soft mysterious-
ness. Many of the songs have no
apparent connection to each other.

They range from Patsy Cline’s ©

“Back in Baby’s Arms” to Snoop
Doggy Dogg’s “What Would U
Do?” By now you may be asking,
“How could all these different
themes fit together into a coherent
album?” Well, they don’t. Reznor
was aware of this, so he decided to
tie the tracks together by what they
all have in common—the movie.
Reznor includes segments of dia-
logue between much of the music.

This tactic successfully connects >

the songs and brings out the choppy
mood of the movie.

The soundtrack does not work
without being placed in the con-
text of the movie. To someone who
bought the soundtrack before see-
ing the movie the contrast of the
different tracks just comes across
as annoying. My advice is to first
see the movie, and if you like the
movie, then consider the
soundtrack. Don’t do as I did and
buy it on compulsion.
