Cross Country going hg

Despite the challenge of a hilly course
and the chaos created by the hoards of hys-
terical screaming fans, the Davidson cross-
country team improved on last week’s per-
formance to finish third out of a highly es-
teemed field of five teams.

Leading the way for the men was Jimmy
Swansbrough ‘03 (27:53) followed closely
by Andrew Schoewe ’03 (28:05), Chris
Schmader 04 (28:07), Colby Broadwater
’04 (28:11), and Dave Bunge ’04 (28:33).

The Davidson freshmen are stepping up
as the major contributing force driving this
young team. Charlie Blankenship, a sixty-
year-old local hairdresser, was quoted as say-
ing, “These young boys are really exciting.”

The Davidson women’s team also im-
proved on last week’s performance, finishing
second out of six teams. The women’s XC

team stunned the thousands of screaming
fans lining the course with their superior
skills as Smyth Bitter ‘01 finished fifth over-
all, running 20:02. She was supported by
Colleen Faes ’04 (20:35), Jenna Kruppa ’04
(21:13), Brooke Kittinger 03 (21:28), and
Liz Gross ’03 (21:37).

With their first five runners in the top
twenty overall, the women’s team made it
perfectly clear that they will be the team to
watch in the Southern Conference this year,

Both teams will be running their next
race at McAlpine Park in Charlotte on Sep-
tember 22. ;

Davidson alumnus runner Steve “Snake”
Johnston colorfully summed up.the home
invitational. “I missed the hills like a snake
misses a shotgun blast to the head, but these
freshman men and women really look like
they can and will carry Davidson running to
a new level.”

Davidson Men’s Soccer Plays “Gift of Life’? Game

By Anpy LANoHA

This Friday evening at 8:00 in Richardson
Stadium, Davidson men’s soccer will square
off against Virginia Tech in what will, un-
doubtedly, be a hard fought match. But, for
this year’s team, the game means much more.
Davidson has decided to dedicate the pro-
ceeds from the home opening match to ben-
efit the Rotary “Gift of Life.”

Since the project was started 12 years
ago, “Gift of Life” has saved the lives of over
60 impoverished children around the world,
providing emergency heart surgeries to chil-
dren who otherwise would not survive.

“T think it’s a wonderful charity,” said
men’s soccer coach Charlie Slagle. “We’re

ws aby

“wy

really excited about the opportunity this match
presents to benefit a great cause and provide
some great soccer to our fans. Hopefully the
community will come out and support this
worthwhile charity event and we hope that,
through our ticket sales, we'll be able to fund
an operation for a needy child.”

Though the project has tremendous sup-
port from the Rotary Club and the medical
community, such operations still have ex-
penses, each one costing approximately
$7,500. Davidson hopes to raise money to
cover some of these expenses and help save
the life of a needy child.

Student and faculty admission to the
game will remain free, however, both are
encouraged to bring money to donate to this
worthy cause.

The mounting tension of a four-game
losing streak melted away on Sunday, as
Davidson earned its first home win of the
season, rolling past Sacred Heart 3-0.

“Thank heavens,” said:an elated head
coach Jen Halliday. “It was a long time com-

ing.”
Almost

70} test was

defensive

territory, with Davidson ‘earning 26 corners
and out-shooting the Pioneers 27-3.

Senior Lea Jaeger struck first, convert-
ing an assist from Agnes Bateman to give
Davidson a 1-0 lead.

Jennie Gold and
Kathryn Clark also
tallied goals for the
Wildcats. Clark’s tip-
in with 29:22 to play
marked the first ca-
reer goal forthe fresh-
man from LaJolla,

Calif.

“We finally
solved our scoring is-
sues,’ smiled

Halliday, whose squad had squandered an
abundance of scoring opportunities in recent
losses.

A major contributing factor to Sunday’s
victory was the play of senior co-captain
Ashley Hart. “Ashley had a great game
today,” Halliday said. “She really was on top

of her game. She was corner-drawing

woman.”
With the victory, Davidson improves to

2-4. “I don’t think our record reflects the
caliber of our team atall,” said goalie Amanda
Mordavsky, who notched her third career
shut-out on Sunday. “Look at how many
games we’ ve lost by one goal.”

All eighteen active position-players saw
action on Sunday. “I saw some great things
when we subbed people in,” said Halliday. “

People weren’t settled to simply play,
they went in determined to play well.”
Jaeger agreed. “It was great to see everyone
out there. They were all excited and each
played so well. It was a really good feeling
when everyone was clicking together.”

Perhaps the most telling image of
Sunday’s action was the triple-toned hairdo
sported by Mordavsky. “I think we’re start-
ing to develop attitude, and that’s the differ-
ence,” ex-
plained the
junior
goaltender.
“And that’s
why my hair
is flaming or-
ange.”

David-
son treks to
Winston-Sa-
lem on Sun-
day for per-
haps its biggest challenge of the season.
“Wake is a top-ten team, probably a top-five
team,” said Halliday. ““We’re going to try a
couple of different things out.”

Davidson then travels to Catawba before
resuming NorPac conference play on Sep-
tember 23 by hosting Appalachian State.
