Despite many line-up changes
this season, the Davidson junior
varsity basketball team has
somehow stuck together.

The underclassmen, who
have lost Sheldon Parker and
Jay Powell to the varsity team,
and Bob Vander Griend and
Jim Lowry to injuries, have had
a fairly good season with seven
wins and two losses.

The two defeats have both
been to ACC opponents, Clem-
son and Duke, and the Kittens
will have other chances at both
of these teams later in the
season.

Freshman Tom Verlin. the
team’s leading scorer, came to
Davidson for the same reason
as many other Wildcat athletes.
“I thought I could get a good
education and play basketball
at the same time,” he said.

He also talked about this
decision, saying ‘‘In the begin-

Rixey Confident Despite Layoff

This season has been a big
disappointment for freshman
center Eppa Rixey, who, after
missing the first eight weeks of
the season, is now playing or
the junior varsity team.

“Those were the worst eight
weeks of my life,"’ said the 6-8
product of Indian Hill High
School in Cincinnati, Ohio. “‘I
couldn't do anything and my
shoulder hurt all the time.”’

Rixey was also disheartened
because his goal as a freshman
had been to make the varsity,
whic’ he did only to find himself
watching from the sideline after
dislocating his left shoulder lit-
tle more than a week before the
season started.

Rixey had to undergo an
operation and have his shoulder
put back together with three
Staples.

‘The doctors are pleased with
the way it looks now,” said
Rixey, adding that there was ‘‘a
little doubt as to whether his
shoulder would ever be 100 per
cent again.”

But Rixey remains confident.
He works out with weights
frequently and undergoes
whirlpool treatments.

“The shoulder has been im-
proving, but I have not regained
the external rotation of my
shoulder which messes up my
shot,”’ said Rixey.

Rixey chose Davidson over
“about 15 schools” including
Clemson, Ohio State, Indiana
and Michigan because it is a
small school with a good
student - faculty ratio and a
good pre-medical program.

He also noted the extremely
good basketball program,
including both coaches and
players, and Davidson's overall
academic status as factors in
his choosing Davidson.

Rixey said there were several
transitions which had to be
made between playing high
school basketball and major
college basketball.

‘“‘T had to learn to use my jum-
ping ability because I'm
relatively shorter now,” said

Rixey. “I cannot just stand and due to the added quickness of
reach for the ball anymore."’ college basketball and added

players tell me, but anyone with the title of “interim

coach” is bound to suffer because of that position.

What I am actually requesting, of everyone, from
John M. Bevan to every student, is that they take a
serious, unprejudiced look at our athletic department
and try to help the people that run the gym straighten
themselves out. Maybe, after some study, we can
decide that they are indeed doing a good job; maybe
we cen help them find the weaknesses in their pro-
grams that they can't see. Maybe we'll find them un-
necessary to life at Davidson. Whatever the case, it is
the only reasonable and healthy thing this school can
do.

Athletics are a very important part of student life at
Davidson, but they are continually maligned,
mistreated or ignored. The answer probably lies in
student initiative, but here that is almost nonexistent.
I can only hope that our new SGA president can live
up to his promise to try to objectively look at the
situation and come up with a realistic appraisal.
Hopefully from that, we can find some realistic an-
swers.

other problems cited by Rixey.

Academically, Rixey has
found Davidson very difficult
but very interesting and more
relevant compared to his high
school.

He indicated that he was hap-
py just to be playing again and
that he hopes to play some var-
sity ball.

‘Whatever I can do to help
the team I'll do whether it
means playing junior varsity or
keeping stats,"’ said Rixey. “‘I
want the team to make the
regional tournament worst of
all. That means we will have to
win the conference and beat
Furman.”

ning I wasn't enjoying it, but
now I think everything will
work out."

Because of the team’s lack of
height, ‘the beached whale”
(as Verlin is known to friends)
is forced to play an inside game.

When asked about this, Verlin
replied that “I like it; I did a lot
of that in high school. I really
enjoy getting rebounds over
bigger guys.”

The real big man on the team
however, is Ed Yeaton, a 6-6
freshman from: Janesville.
Wisconsin.

Yeaton had rather not play
the part of the big man. ‘‘That
was my usual position in high
school, but I'd really rather be
out on the wing.”

Yeaton also noted that the
team has been somewhat in-
consistent so far this season.

*‘We have a lot of playes from
a lot of different high schools.
So far we haven't really gotten
together, but we're pretty much
getting it together now,"’ he ad-
ded.

In the Kittens’ last outing
with Wake Forest, Verlin,
Yeaton, Kirke Combe, Joe Dun-
can, and Jeff Plowman led the
team to an 88-82 victory over
Deacons.

Combe and Duncan were both
seven for eight from the floor,
while Plowman spearheaded
the Kittens’ attack from his

point position.
