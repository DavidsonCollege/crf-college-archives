An ovewhelming majority were in

The lowest to tip the beams was a creature

might have been a joke, or the signer might
have wanted his girl to hold down his flivver
to keep it from rattling.

The brunettes were certainly in vogue as

henna hair (whatever that is) but only one
request came in for auburn hair. <A little
more than one-third called for black hair. On
a special form it was found that 80 per cent
called for bobbed hair.

Eighty per cent of the answers said that
only a slender girl would do for them. Twen-
ty per cent called for medium figures, and a
small majority even asked for the more ro-
bust kind. One wanted his beauty to be
“fairly fat!’ Her foot was to be a number 4.

Only one more vote was cast for brown
eyes than for those of blue. Ten per cent
wanted black eyes, while hazel and grey eyes
received only one call out of the entire stu-
dent body. Only four men called for artifi-
cial complexion and the rest wanted it as
natural as a full-blown rose. A few declared
themselves willing to accept a little of each
if it was skillfully mixed.

When it came to names, Margaret led the
field by a fair majority. About nine per cent
of the answers specified this name. Mary
was next in popularity, then Elizabeth, . Vir-
ginia, Helen, Martha and Ruth in order. Of
course a few extraneous names were added |
to the list, such as Heilotrope, Tyia, Ygraine |
and others,

So much for this division. Under mental
traits appeared a few enlightening qualifica-
tions. In spite of the many varied answers
given to the question of Disposition, the pre-
dominant one was “sweet.” Other answers
included independence, gentleness, meekness,
kindness to animals, high-spiritedness, pa-
tience, affableness, sympathy and the trium-
virate of faith, hope and charity.

A large majority specified that this Ideai |
Girl must have a four year college education
before she could be acceptable as a wife.
Evidently they pictured this Girl as a co-ed
or an inmate of some girls’ college. Most
of them wanted her to be witty, some serious
and a good many specified wittiness and
seriousness in their proper places. All but
11 wanted her to have some knowledge of
music and art. A few said that such knowl-!
edge was immaterial.

In the last division, there were many di-
verse opinions. Smoking was pretty gener-
ally tabooed, as only nine and four-tenths
per cent of the questions said that smoking
would be permissible. Five per cent said
that it was immaterial and the rest were
against it in any form. Drinking was the
same way. About 86 per cent were heartily
against drinking alcoholic liquors, and the
rest said that their Ideal Girl could drink if
she wanted to.

The plain question was asked whether one’s
Ideal Girl would indulge in any petting. On
this important question 45 per cent’ said ab-
solutely not, 33 per cent said yes, and 22 per
cent qualified this last with the statement
that she would pet only them.

Only two per ¢ent of all the answers speci-

Unusual Statements Are
Made in Questionaires

Davidson Men Fail to Agree on
Important Requisites of Ideal
(Girl

The recent questionnaire concerning the
ideal girl has brought many interesting things
to light in regard to the Davidson students’
requisites in the particular choice.
some of these are what might be expected
from such a gathering of college men.

In regard to smoking 85 per cent of the
students that their

ideal girl must not
cent will permit her to

smoke, while 4.8 per cent are indifferent.
The affirmative and negative of the petting
proposition are not as far apart as some
prophesied that they would be. Those in

favor of the girl petting totaled 55 per cent,
negative 45 per cent. However, 21.6 per cent
indicated that they were in favor of the girl
petting them exclusively.

The drink question is truly astounding for
a school of the reputation that Davidson has.
Those allowing their girl to drink totaled 10.8
per and those disfavoring it were 85.8
per cent; 3.4 per cent indicated that it Was
entirely immaterial.

cent,

One question ran true to the general esti-
mate, that of dancing; 78.8 per cent were in
favor and 21,2 per cent against letting their
ideal girl dance.

Many strange and humorous questionnaires
were returned to the staff for averaging.
Some of the voters has either received a cold
letter from their girl, or they belonged to the

;ten per cent who favored the inbibing of

spirits. Still there is no accounting for
some tastes ; perhaps they are sincere. There
was a wide variance in age, the lowest re-
Which goes to
that Davidson not without its
“cradle robbers.” On the other hand one
voter had the ideal at 40 years of age; per-
haps she is wealthy.

1S

Three members ot the student body evi-
dently are desirous of looking up to their
ideal in more ways than one. Or, perhaps
these men are small and seck protection.
Anyway these said their ideal girl was over
six feet in height. These students were con-
siderate enough to allow size of shoe in pro-
portion to height. It is a strange fact that
several of these rather abnormal creatures
over six feet, wearing a number ten shoe,
having red hair, a mean disposition, green
eyes, and having ability as a clog dancer,
are expected by the subjects of the question-
naire to be found at Converse.

fied that the Girl would be a society butter-
fly, and the great majority were heartily
“again” it. All except four boys wanted her
to have some athletic ability. One said that
he wanted her to have enough to beat up any
impertinent traveling salesman. All except
three per cent wanted her to have a knowl-
edge of the household arts. Two fellows said
that this was immaterial.

The last question, “Do you expect to find
her and where?” brought many varied re-
sponses. About 85 per cent said that they
expected to find her somewhere. Strange to
say, about 20 or 25 fellows said, that they
expected to find her at Converse College! A
few mentioned heaven, “somewhere” and
other answers ranged from Talledega, Ala-
bama, to Walla Walla, Washington. Most
of the questionnaires were signed, but a few
were loathe to have their innermost secrets
and aspirations brought to the light of jour-
nalistic publicity.
