Greek Week: Means To An
End Or End In Itself?

The Davidson fraternity system
has met in recent weeks particuarly
strong criticism and questions. The
keynote to the present unrest, felt by
both faculty and students, is the al-
ways controversial Greek Week.

We are assured by IFC President
Ward McKeithen that 1960 Greek
Week activities will be closely super-
vised. McKeithen has further stated
that strict rules have been made, and
that heavy fines will be imposed on
offenders. (See last week's David-
sonian.)

We hope that this will be the case.
We hope that the IFC will not be
shackled by its too-specific rules, and
will not forget that it has the final
say-so and the final obligation when’
it comes to interpreting the general
rules. We hope that it can meet situa-
tions head on when fraternities skirt
the specific rules with other activities
equally as degrading.

But this is not the real problem at
hand. The real problem is this: when
the fraternities are an integral part
of Davidson College, how can they
ignore their half of the bargain? They
are part of an educational institution;
every action should be directed to-
ward the same goal as that of the in-
stitution.

But when, at the beginning of
second semester when the freshmen
become more closely associated with
their groups, academic achievement
in freshmen classes drop off alarm-
ingly, we cannot help wondering if
there is an equal investment from
both partners.

Greek Week itself is part of this
attitude, President McKeithen asserts
that the fraternity system is not sick.
We can hardly agree. A healthy sys-
tem would not meet the criticism
that ours does, and it would .not be
plagued by disillusioned seniors ne-
gating their active affiliation. Some of
them say that they went inactive be-
cause of financial reasons, Even so,
this means that the return is not
worth the investment, whereas before
this year it may have been.

We would like to see an objective
self-examination on the part of the
fraternities. Is the pledge program
designed to satisfy sophomore broth-
ers who “had to do it, so why should-

n’t this year's class?” Or is it designed
to develop a firm friendship and a
mutual understanding? We are afraid
that it is the former, even though it
may be disguised as the latter.

Proponents say that “A little head
unifies the pledge class.” Perhaps it
does. But what fraternity will adver-
tise that it has four “unified” classes?
Should not the aim be to unify the
fraternity as a whole?

We see only one way that the
fence between pledges and brothers
can be broken down. It will collapse
through a common effort toward a
common goal, and the result will be
a unified fraternity, in every sense of
the word.

But we must not forget that the
goal should be as close to that of
the college as possible. Some fratern-
ities have made a stép toward this
goal by making a genuine ‘Help
Week’ part of the pledge program.
The line between pledges and broth-
ers vanishes under common “blisters.
No one who has had such an experi-
ence will forget it.

But even this falls short. If such
an experience is so meaningful once
a year, why not repeat it more often?
One such project every six weeks
totals five a year, and if twelve fra-
ternities participated, the goal would
be shared by all. They need not be
four-day programs; even Saturday
afternoons provide good opportunity.

The 85% statistic shows that the
fraternities are easily the most pow-
erful organizations on the campus.
This power should not be wasted or
ignored.

Educationa) projects should be al-
most sure-fire. The IFC concert series
leans this way; we would like to see
an IFC-sponsored lecture series. Well-
known speakers bring a vote of con-
fidence and admiration te the fratern-
ity which secures them. Charity
projects would help justify a fratern-
ity’s existence. So would organized
scholarship programs, not only for
freshmen, but for upperclassmen as
well. So would emphasis on such pro-
grams as the Artist Series.

So would any project directed to-
ward improving the value of a David-
son education.

We would all do well to stop and
think.

Needed: Instruction
Along With Construction

With the approval of: sabbaticals
and leaves of absence by the Trustees,
the total number of faculty members
who will not be with the college next
year has increased to ten.

Dr. Labban, Dr. Abernethy, Dr.
Ratliff and Dr. Houchens have been
given sabbaticals while Dr. Jackson
and Professor McLane will take leaves
of absence.

, These men join Dr. Evans, Dr.
Satterfield, Dr. Trakas and Dr. Ost-
walt, who will take other positions,
in the list of departures.

Even though six of these men will
return, the growing list causes some
concern. It now includes approximate-
ly one-seventh of the total number of
current faculty members and certain-
ly contains some of the outstanding
professors teaching at Davidson.
Three of these are the only men in
their departments.

Dean Johnston informs us that re-
placements for these professors are

now being censidered. However, re-
placements comparable to the men
being lost will be hard to find.
Departures of this sort bring into
sharp focus the importance of a
strong faculty to any college.
Charles Dana and friends have
seen to it that Davidson has one of
the finest physical plants in the na-
tion, and for this we are grateful.
However, we feel that buildings are
of secondary importance to the men
who teach and learn within them.
We hope that Dean Johnston will
be successful in his attempts to bring
qualified men to Davidson. And we
alse hope, now that we are physically
fully equipped, that there will be a
sufficient increase in faculty salaries
so that teaching at Davidson will be
worthwhile and not only an oppor-
tunity for service.
We are still of the old school
which believes faculties more import-
ant than facilities-—J. H.

ABOLISH STUDENT COUNCIL?

Members Review Council Lag:
Blame Student Indifference

By TOM HUDGINS
and TOM PARKER

Since the time for Student
Council elections for the com-
ing year is now drawing near,
it seems fitting that we review
the achievements of the present
administration.

Such a review at this time
might prove somewhat em-
barrassing, for the achieve-
ments of this council are al-
most nil.

If this is true, obviously the
present system of student gov-
ernment should be circumspect-
ly studied with a view toward
improvement.

Doubtless the failure of the
council can be attributed, to a
large degree, to the inadequate
leadership evidenced by the
council and the apathy of the
student body.

The councils of the past
three years, however, have
done no better except, per-
haps, for the establishment
of the Honor Court. Student
criticism of the Council’s
lack of leadership and author-
ity in campus iseves is valid
now end has been for some
time.

According to popular opinion,
it appears that this body should
do three things—legislate, serve
as a means of communication

between the faculty ‘and the
student body, and discuss non-
legislative issues, i.e., those is-
sues not concerned with stu-
dent conduct.

As things stand now, how-

and preside over student
body functions.

In addition to carrying out
the duties of the present system
(i.e. appointing the election

board and the Court of Control),

ever, the Council does not leg-*the new council, through Fri-

islate, because it fears or feels
unaware of popular opinion.
Rather it serves as a mouth-
piece for the faculty through
the president and leaves non-
legislative issues to the
Y.M.C.A. Thus Student Coun-
cil actually serves as little
more than an organized bull
session for the students
elected under Davidson’s
unique election system.
Perhaps student body en-
thusiasm is the answer, or per-
haps, as some members have
suggested, the council should
re-establish its past function by
reabsorbiny the Honor Court.

If, .however, the primary
function of student government
is judicial, it seems that not
the Honor Court but the Stu-
dent Council should be abolish-
ed.

A third feasible plan thet
we personally favor would be
to retain the Honor Court and
to replace the Student Coun-
ell with a Student Body Coun-
cil. This body would consist
of the three class presidents
and a student body president
who would serve as chairman

day's Chapel period and open
debate and voting by the stu-
dents, could effectively ascer-
tain student opinion on legisla-
tiye and non-legislative matters.

Thus the study body presi-
dent could express direclly the
feelings of the students to the
faculty. Certainly this would
facilitate faculty-student rela-
tions even though faculty co-
operation would still be a major
factor.

We believe that our state-
ments about the functions of

the present system can be
largely supported by the
councit meeting report in
last week's DAVIDSONIAN.

We want only to bring to
light the weaknesses of the
present system and to urge the
student body to take -an in-
terest in this matter.

In any case, only the students
can change Student Govern-
ment from a lifeless figurebead
into an active body serving the
best interests of the student
body and college, either by ma-
king the present system func
tion or, altering the basic foun-
dations of this system.

Dear Editor: .

This week it is with peasure
that I write, for I am now warin
at night under my wool vi-gin
and my faith in the Davidson
Honor System has been re-
stored.

Thanks to your publishing
my letter fast week, my blan-
ket was found on the beck
lending of second floor East

This,.1 feel, is a credit to the
Davidson Gentlemen as well as
to your advertising potential.
Thank you.

Dear Editor:

It seems obvious that the Ad-
missions Committee and the
hiring body for the faculty have
shown a lack of discretion and
judgement the last few years.

This is the only logical ex-
planation I can find for defi-
ciency of intelligence and com-
mon sense that is being contin-
ually exhibited by our dubious
student leaders and various pro-
fessors.

For the past month these in-
telligentsia, these intellectual
giants, have been browbeating
and criticing the Board of
Trustees, the college officials,
and the clear.minded conserva-
tives with petition, pen, and
prank over the Board's decision
and the college’s stand on Seg-
regation,

I am beginning to wonder if
these rabblerousing liberals
have ever actually considered
the consequences of integration
at Davidson College.

These Champions of Justice,

while constantly harping on the

injustices of Segregation, fail to
‘sce the greater injustices to the
Present student body, the pos-
sible future Negro student, and
the college if Integration were
to come about.

A Negro in this school would
be under a canstant and unfor-
giving surveillance from both
the facuty and the student
body. His achievements or opin-
ions would vrobably be ignored
or degraded.

As most national fraternities

contain a white clause, he would
undoubtedly be excluded from
fraternity life, although accord-
ing to some English professors
this would not be a major tra-
gedy! .
But, it would be a contribu-
ting factor to the overall em-
phasis of complete social iso-
lation that a rational person
surely must see is inevitable

Davidson being predominant-
ly a’southern school, how would
the prestige and reputation of
this college be affected if Ne-
groes were admitted to this
campus? Would we continue to
be swamped with applicants?
What effect would it have on
donations?

Even though, at times, the
Trustees leave much to be de-
sired, deesn’t it seem logical
that they would be interested ia
the continued welfare of the
college?

Why don't we quit being
little generals and let the lead-
ing be done by the leaders?

Says Paper Guilty
Of Misrepresentation

To: The Davidson College
Publications Board.

This letter is intended to
serve notice of my resignation
as Business Manager of THE
DAVIDSONIAN, as a result of
certain personal convictions
and certain circumstances
which have arisen during the
past few monthe.

First, I do not care to lend
my name or effort to the poli-
cies which have lately consum-
ed THE DAVIDSONIAN.

Having due respect for the
Negro and concern for his ad-
vancement and the problems
and situations attending his in-
tegration in our present way of
life, 1 nevertheless find some
policies of THE DAVIDSONIAN
in the past seven months at
variance with my personal
views, as these policies have
run from one extreme to the
other, and with the assumption
of editorial duties‘by Mr. Smith,
find it used to pressure the
trustees of the college in a
matter that is their free choice,

and used to misrepresent Dav-
idson College to the general
public, and in general failing to
serve the purposes for which it
was established—to report to
and inform Davidson students
of news in an impartial and ac-
curate way.

Secondly, since THE DAVID-
SONIAN is finaneed by student
fees, I feel its foremost respon-
sibility is to these students and
crusading or opinions on con-
troversial subjects should be
confined to the editorial sec
tions of the newspaper.

Surely there are many sub-
jects at hand, deserving atten-
tion and a clear presentation of
facts involved, which are being
neglected. THE DAVIDSONIAN
belongs to the college commun-
ity and not to any faction or
group, regardless of who is
entrusted with its editorship.

On these grounds I resign,
without malice, but as a protest
to what many consider to be a
growing misuse of THB DAV-
IDSONIAN.

‘STERLING COMMENTS:

For 1960: A Lack
Of Real Leadership gy

By PETER STERLING ay

It is difficult to understand how the 1960 Pres-
idental Election tan be called a battle between Demo-
crats and Republicans. It is, more exactly, a battle among
senatorial personalities.

The American political system has developed many
splinter parties, based not upon distinct philosophies as
in France, but upon the personality of the individual
candidate. This is much in evidence in the 1960 Cam-

paign.

MANIFOLD EFFECTS

The effects of this development of the election of
personalities are manifold.

First, neither the Democrats nor the Republicans
have executed firm leadership in the last decade. The
Republican Administration has been an extension of all
the “Deals” without imagination or forethought to in-
spire necessary new programs.

The Democrats, in turn, while controlling Congress
for the past six years, have failed to present a construc-
tive opposition to the White House. They have fought
so hard among themselves that their effectiveness has
been lost in “family troubles”.

This lack of leadership has often caused the Ameri-
can people and her allies to guess what our policy really
is.

NO FIRM POLICIES

The second effect is contingent upon the first.
Neither party has presented policies which firmly sepa-
rate the two. Both parties have tried to give evéry seg-
ment of the population benefits in order not to be
classified as favoring one group over another. Conse-
quently, both parties have “watered down” their prin-
ciples so as to antagonize no group.

Not only, therefore, do the parties fail to give an
image of their objectives, but they give the voter few
alternatives in, elections. The difference between Dem-
ocrats and Republicans today is more in degree than in
basic policy.

CAMPAIGNS PROFESSIONALIZED

Thirdly, election campaigns have become more pro-
fessionalized, thus reducing the voice of the voter as
to whom his candidate should be. Each candidate can
build a tremendous machine (witness Kennedy) which
in previous years only the party itself could afford.
The voter, therefore, sees little party cohesiveness, nor
can he makc himself heard through party circles. ,

Increasingly, the party organization is weakening
while the candidates’ organizations are growing strong-
er. The consequence of this is that the candidate must
be independently wealthy or have access to huge con-
tributions while the parties grow poorer.

e

LESS VOICE

The overall effect of the splintering of the political
parties in the U.S. is that the voter has less and less
voice in his government. He finds that the candidates
(now all in the Senate) reduce the national party policy
to platitudes while trying to create the impression of
their own leadership ability.

As voters become less interested because they find
the alternatives between parties so slight and because
they find leadership so lacking, it becomes easier for
poor political bosses and demagogues to take over.

INSISTENCE ON LEADERSHIP

Americans must insist that the national parties
present strong leadership and definitive policies. We
can no longer afford arguments in degree (such as
whether to spend $3.5B or $3.6B on missiles) but each
party must present programs which are more in the
national interest.

The cult of personality in national politics wilt
eventually weaken the democratic process by discour-
aging voting and encouraging irresponsibile leadership.

One of the problems today-is to find a man capable
of meeting the tremendous concerns facing Americans
today.

I see no such man on the political horizon.

THE HAWK’S NEST

Fraternities Fail To
Realize Potential

By JACK TAYLOR

The recent rash' of fraternity end spiritual shallowness,
members seeking inactive stat- when, because of their near

us was, in several instances, an
indictment of the lethargic
state in which the fraternity
system here at Davidson wal-
lows.

Charges of mediocrity, in-
tellectual terpidity, spiritual
shallowness, end superficial
brotherhood were leveled et
the system by the dissatisfied
insurgents.

These accusation are not eas-
ily dismissed; the evidences
supporting them are too ob-
vious.

Where the bleme fies is
difficult to determine. Per
haps it is not the fraternity
system itsel# which induces
apithy, conformity, medie
erity, and antl-Intetlectualiem.
It is conceivable that the at-

Utudes might be symptoms of a
more far-reaching sickness than
the fraternity system alone.

Perhaps they are inherent
with a homogeneous student
body.

Perhaps they result from ad-

‘ministrative paternalism.

Perhaps they are a reflection
of the large lassitude which is
said to prevail among college
students throughout the United
States.

Whatever the causes under.
lying these attitudes, .the fra-
ternities can not be held blame-
less.

~The fraternities have per-

mitted the perpetuation of
mediocrity, mental lethargy,

totality et Davidson, it is the
fraternities who sre in the
strongest position to oppose
these attitudes.

Instead, the fraternities have
reduced themselves to the stat-
us of boarding houses, depen-
dant for significance upon their
totality. They have failed to
grasp the greater vision of their
potential.

They have limited their
meaning to that of a sociel
orgenization, end have furth-
er reduced this definition by
interpreting social to mesa
after-dance party.

Such narrowness is ;hardly
justified in a system which en-
compasses eighty-five percent
of the student body.

In its grandest state, the fra-
ternity is more than a boarding
house, more than eight orgs
nized parties a year, more than
sixty names to be memorized.

In ite grandest state the re-
lettonships between the men-
bers become fused in a dy-
mamle force which affects
each member, not only ful-
filling his social needs, but
siso urging him to esteblish
his identity as an individual,
and encouraging him te ex.
amine tife for its deepest
meanings.

If the fraternities at David-
son are to have any real signifi-
cance, they must grasp the
reality of their full potential,
and exert every effort neces-
sary to actualize this potential.
