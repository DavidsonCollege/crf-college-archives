Countdown continues: to opening of Baker —

Sports Complex i in mid-September

By PETER BYNUM

Despite several unanticipated prob-
lems over the summer, all seems to be
on schedule for the opening of the new
Baker Sports Complex this fall.

According to Grover Meetze, direc-
tor of Facilities Planning, most of the
building should be operational and
ready for student use by mid-Septem-
ber. However, several weeks of minor
transitional difficulties are to be ex-
pected as the athletics department is
transported from Johnston Gym.

The facility will offer numerous play-
ing areas. Six racquetball courts, one
squash court, an Olympic-size swim-
ming pool and several intramural bas-
ketball courts are only a few of the
features that will be available to the

‘student body. Meetze is excited about
the impact that the center will have on
campus life, stating that few other col-
leges of comparable size can boast of
“such a fine athletic addition.”

Meetze and his team were faced with
some unexpected troubleshooting dur-
ing the summer as they simultaneously
juggled contractors, plumbers, electri-
cians and the like.

The columns around the entrance to
the center were changed, requiring
some adjustments to the original de-
sign. Workers have also had to be cau-
tious around a recently planted River
Birch tree that will grace the prome-
nade. Veteran construction hands are
getting a quick course in horticulture,
for the tree is evidently at a delicate

» Stage in its development and demands
careful attention.

The opening walkway and entrance
to the complex have been designed
with a particular idea in mind - stu-
dent participation.

According to Meetze, every effort
has been made to tie the facility to the
rest of the campus. The large stairway
and. sidewalk descending from
Richardson Field is intended both to
draw students and to encourage visi-
tors to the arena to explore more of the
campus.

Meetze added that the glass-en-
closed spectator areas and a sundeck
on the south side of the building are
expected to make Baker an inviting and
comfortable place for all students.

Terry Holland, who will become di-
rector of athletics in the fall of 1990, has
insisted that the seats nearest to the
floor in Richardson Arena be desig-
nated as the “student section.”

Although the complex will be ready
for use in September, a November
“gala” has been planned. for its official
opening and dedication. Meetze claims
that the festivities “should rival the
celebrations of the Israelites when they
defeated the Philistines.”. .

Hopefully. his -analogy.. will prove
true for the sports thatsoon will callthe
Baker Sports Complex “home,” Per-
haps this will be an arena in which the
small but feisty Davidson Wildcats will
once again slay the Goliaths of the
NCAA.
