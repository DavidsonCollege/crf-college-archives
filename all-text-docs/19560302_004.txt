By TOM MORGAN
Believing that theater arts de-
serve a place as an integral part of
a liberal arts education, the Red

| and Black Masquers was organized

at Davidson College to provide an

| outlet for members of the student

body whose talents and interests

| are especially suited for this mode

of expression.

It seeks to do this by providing
interesting, entertaining, and ar-
tistically significant dramatic pro-
ductions, A further aim is to ree-
ognize superior achievement of
persons in the field of theater arts,
which it does by electing them to
membership in the organization.

Gleaning talent from the stu-
dent body, the faculty, the faculty
wives, and the nearby communi-
ties, the group has in recent years
presented a wide variety of dra-
matic works

Among these have been Every-
man, an ancient morality play; sev
eral groups of one act’ plays in
cluding, Where The Cross Is Made,

by Eugene O'Neill; and The Twelve
Pound Look, by James Barrie; sev-
eral three act plays: The Hasty
Heart, Journey's End, and The Bi-
shop Misbehaves.

In 1954 the Masquers had the
privilege of presenting a play writ-
ten by one of its members. A
Chronicle of Joe by Fred Myers
was an excellent delineation of
modern man caught in the web of |
our complex society.
