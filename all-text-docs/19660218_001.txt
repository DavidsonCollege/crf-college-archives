CHAPLAIN TERRY COUNSELS STUDENT
Plans “Continued involvement’ With Students

Will Terry Accepts Call
From College Church

Rev. Will H. Terry, Davidson
chaplain, has accepted the call
from the Davidson College Pres-
byterian Church to fill the pulpit
vacated by Rev. Curtis P. Har-

per.

The Pulpit Committee, mode-
rated by William Ward, first con-
tacted Terry in January. The
congregation approved the com-

Two Juniors Compete
For Social Council Post

Vince Foster and Bill Kendrick were the only
students appearing before a meeting of the Social
Council to have their candidacy as next year’s So-
cial Council chairman approved.

The Council met Monday night to screen all

interested candidates.

After brief statements by

Foster and Kendrick, Council member John Bailey
moved to accept both as candidates, and his motion

carried unanimously.

Dan Campbell gave them the specifications for
their platforms, which will appear in next week's

DAVIDSONIAN.

The election had originally been scheduled for

Tuesday, but because of t
dents not receiving THE DA

e possibility of many stu-
IDSONIAN this week-

end, the election was postponed until the follow-

ing Tuesday, March 1.

Campbell explained that the reason for the early
election was to begin work on next year’s social pro-

gram.

He also said that the new chairman needs

experience in.the mechanics of booking and carrying

out the details of a weekend.

mittee’s proposal Sunday.

President D. Grier Martin was
not available for comment on
the school’s plan for replacing
Terry. However Terry indicated
that he plans to continue as
chaplain through the school
year, filling both roles until the
college has time to select a new
chaplain.

Terry has already met with
the Religious Life Committee to
discuss the duties of chaplain,
in preparation for the selection
of his replacement.

Terry pointed out that even
after a new chaplain is selected,
he intends to continue to part-
icipate in the life of the college
and the life of students by fol-
lowing his policy of visiting
dormitories and welcoming stu-
dents in his home.

Terry stressed that one of the
reasons for his accepting the
new position was his ‘‘interest
in students personally, and con-
tinued involvement with them
will enable them to be brought
more into the life of the church.”

Terry will deliver nis first
sermon as the new pastor March
13. He also will speak at Vespers
Sunday night on the marriage
ceremony.

Student Body Approves

Constitutional Changes
ere Hee

By overwhelming majorities, the student body ap-
proved all three proposed amendments to the Student
Body Constitution in Tuesday’s referendum.

As a result of passage of the
first proposed amendment, Arti-
cle V, Section 5 of the Student
Body Constitution now reads:
“Trial procedure shall be deter-
mined by the Honor Court and
made available to the student
body.

“This shall include an invest-
igation committee of three mem-
bers elected by the student ‘body
who shall perform their duties as
prescribed in the Honor Court
procedure.”

SECOND ADMENDMENT

Article VII, Section 5 of the
Constitution, the subject of the
second proposed amendment,
now reads: “Every student
found guflty of violating any sec-
tion of this Article shal! ordinar-
ily be dismissed from. the. col-
lege.”’

The passage of the third pro-
posed amendment changes Arti-
cle II, Section 2 of the Student
Body Constitution to read: ‘'The
purpose of the Honor Court shall
be to encourage and maintain

the honor of the student bdy..

“Since Davidson strives to be
a Christian college and thus re-
cognizes both a concern for un-
derstanding and compasion as
well as for justice and honor,

ythe Court shall implement its
| purpose through instilling in the

student body an awareness of
the ‘basic principles of honor,
through administering the Honor
System, and through enforcing
its decisions as it sees fit in the
light of each individual case.”
COUNTS

Vote counts on the amend-
ments wete 377 for 12 against:
382 for, 19 against; and 371 for,
28 against, respectively, for the
three amendments.

George Kuykendall, originator

SCOTT’S REPLY

of a petition which was influent-
ial in proposing the three amend-
ments, said he was “real hap-
py’’ the amendments passed.

Kuykendall said he felt the
new admendments do not weak-
en, but broaden, the system.

They eliminate a ‘‘rigid, legal-
istic, Old Testament flavor"
which characterized the old hon-
or system, Kuykendall said.

INCREASED DIFFICULT

Kuykendall also stated that the
Honor Court's job has now been
made more difficult since they
must now decide not only the
guilt or innocence of a defend-
ent but also his sentence.

Bill Council, .student body
president, said that the changes
‘‘will not enable justice to be
carried out better than in the
old system but will enable the
Honor Court to work more
smoothly.”

In further explaining _ this,
Council’ said that he felt the
Honor Court in the past has done
a fine job of judging each case
individually, considering exten-
uating circumstances and using
compassion in pronouncing sen-
tences; however, the changes
should, Council said, enable the
Honor Court to do so more
easily.

NICHOLS

Eric Nichols, senior member
of ‘the Honor Court, was in a-
greement with Council as he said
the changes bring the ‘‘letter
of the law more in line with the
spirit of the law.”

Kuykendall, Council and Nich-
ols all emphasibed that they felt
the amendments will not weaken
the Honor System nor weaken
the deterrent effect of the Hon-
‘or System punishments.

‘| Work With Administration’

By JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Associate Editor
“I work with the administra-

tion,” answered Davidson's Ath-
letic Director Tom Scott this
week in reply to statements last
week by Dr. Paul Marrotte,
chairman of the Faculty Ath-
letic Committee, that the charg-
ing of students for tickets to the
last two coliseum basketball
games is in violation of an agree-
ment made last year with the
committee.

“The Athletic Committee,”
continued Dr. Scott, ‘‘doesn’t
have anything to do with de-
termining prices. Their authority
is over scheduling and that sort
of thing.

“They can recommend, but
they cannot set a policy. The
administration and the Trustees
set the policy. This is who we
work with.”

Dr. Marrotte agreed that the
faculty committee eannot set
the price policy for the game.
“But,” added the professor,
“over the past three years, the
faculty committee has approved
the schedule and the number of
games at the coliseum in rTe-

turn for the granting of good
seating and free admission to
students while school is in ses-
sion."

He stated that the ‘interest of
the student comes first in the
consideration of the committee.”

Dr. Scott asserted that the
statement made at the commit-
tee Feb. 4, 1965, which said that
tickets to coliseum games are
“free when school is in session,
but are half-price during re-
cess,’ was merely a review of
the situation that year and that
“we were certainly not setting
a policy about future coliseum
games.”

‘HE APPROVED IT’

“That is just the way it hap-
pened Jast year,"’ he commented.
“We sent a memo to President
D. Grier Martin last November
informing him of our proposal
for this year and he approved it.
The faculty committee has noth-
ing to do with it.”

In defense of charging stu-
dents for admission, Dr. Scott
pointed that “in the past, we
have given students tickets to 10
games. This year there were

nine games in the coliseum,
counting the Invitational Tourna-
ment over the holidays.
“Students got free admission
to seven games in the gymnas-
ium, plus the Wake Forest, Mar-

quette and West Virginia games

in the coliseum. In addition, the
ones who were here over Christ-
mas got free tickets to the Wil-
liam and Mary game as sort of
a bonus."

Students were able to pay
half-price for the other games
over the holidays (Ohio U. and
two tournament games) and for
the NYU and St. Joseph's
games.

‘OUT OF A HAT’

Asked why he felt 10 games
was the number students should
get free, Scott admitted fhat he
“just pulled this out of a hat, I
guess," but added that ‘‘normal-
ly we won’t have more than 10
home games.”

Scott said that the purpose of
students paying was ‘‘to try. to
help us out on the budget.”

“Also,”* he noted, ‘‘we play St.
Joe on a 50-50 basis, and they
won't come down here if we

fill the place with compliment-
ary tickets. (Out of 8,500 people
at the St. Joe game, 200 were
students.) If we play up there,
the kids will have to miss two
days of school.

“Something that students don’t
realize is that we have a lot bet-
ter setup than a lot of places.
At Duke and Carolina they only
get to go to half the games, and
at West Virginia students have
only one day to pick up their
tickets.”

Noting that although students
pay a $100 activities fee at
Davidson, Scott pointed out that
“counting basketball and foot-
ball games and including op-
portunities to buy at half-price.
students easily get $50 worth of
admissions.

“And we don't get any speci-
fied amount per student from
that fee. anyway."” he added.

Committee Chairman Marrot-
te also remarked to THE
DAVIDSONIAN this week that
“faculty and other employees
are being given advantages
which rightfully belong to stu-
dents only — the free admission

to basketball games. I think the
faculty and other employees
should expect to pay for the bet-
ter seats at all coliseum games.

‘STUDENTS SUFFER’

“The students suffer from the
‘free’ privileges given to other
employees.”

In reference to this proposal,
Scott stated: ‘Although few
schools give the faculty free tic-
kets, the administration feels
that this a a fringe benefit for

the faculty and employees, and
if he (Marrotte) wants to pay !

for tickets he is free to do so."

Attendance figures released
for coliseum games while school
was in session this year show

“probably around 400° at the -
season opener with Wake Forest, ~
494 students alt the Marquette -
game, 919 at the pre-exams West -

Virginia game, 304 at the Satur-
day game with NYU and 200 at

Tuesday’s game with national- -

ly-ranked St. Joe.

“The last two games were at-
tended just about as well as the:
free ones,” observed Scott.

The Social Life Evaluation
Commitee met twice during the

Dr. W. G. Workman, chairman

presidents’ attitudes are, and
that President Martin also un

He pointed out that these
