Useless Report

Don’t treat the visiting committee’s report on Davidson
athletics too seriously. 7

Ostensibly, the Trustees set up the committee to
determine if a school of Davidson’s size and financial
status can or should support athletic teams at their
present levels of competition as well as to examine the
department’s inner machinations. But instead, the report
is anarrow and slipshod examination of only a few of the
issues central to Davidson athletics.

The committee’s report states ratner clearly that its

authors had very little idea what role the College wants
athletics to play in its overall operation. In fact, the
committee’s first recommendation was that Trustees
develop ‘‘a public policy statement outlining the
philosophy, the direction and the goals of intercollegiate
athletics at Davidson College.”

The Trustees told the committee last spring that

Davidson’s committment to Division | men’s basketball :

was practically unshakeable. Following along, the
committee recommended that we maintain our basketball
program at the Division | level in the Southern
Conference, but it gave practically no reasons for this
recommendation.

‘The committee also recommended that the College
consider reducing the number of its minor sports teams,
but apparently forgot that by Southern Conference rules
eliminating even one men’s minor sports team would
cause the College to lose its Conference membership, a
membership the committee strongly endorsed elsewhere
in the reports.

When the Trustees announced the composition of the
visiting athletic committee last April, we maintained that
the committee was intended to pacify critics of
Davidson’s athletic policies rather than serve as a genuine
critical body. (The Davidsonian, April 11, page 4) All three
committee members were college athletic administrators
who brought with them natural biases towards the
maintenance of present athletic programs.

We hope the Trustees will stop avoiding the central
issues in Davidson athletics and initiate honest and
open discussion of the matter with the rest of the College
community.

Students, faculty, administrators, and Trustees must
decide together if Davidson’s athletic priorities are
financially and philosophically wise.

Your Side, Please

An administator’s complaints about a column this
newspaper ran almost a year ago finally reached us this
week.

The administrator said the column had angered him as
soon as he read it last fall, but he saw no reason to object
until spring term finals. We unsuccessfully attempted to
speak with the administrator during finals, only to find
upon our return that the administrator had bad-mouthed
The Davidsonian at a rather large alumni meeting.

Here at The Davidsonian we make every effort to ensure
that. our published opinions are reasonable and, based on
fact, and that each news story we run is accurate in every
way.

Admittedly, we make mistakes. But when we do, we
want to hear about them as soon as possible so we can

correct readers’ false impressions while the original .

article is still fresh in their minds, not weeks or months
later. Not to inform us of errors makes our: job of
presenting the truth much more difficult and cheats the
reader in-the process. |

We also’ urge those with opinions contrary to ours to
express them in a letter to the editor instead of merely
grumbling about “that crazy newspaper” to friends. |

The Davidsonian has been, and will continue to be,
strongly committed to accurate reporting and presenting
both sides of the issues. .

We can’t do either as effectively as we would like until -

we hear your side.

Alumnus letter

Editor’s Note: Herb Dimmock,
'74 was kind enough to permit
The Davidsonian to print his
response to an appeal from
Frank Matthews, '49, Chair-
man of the 1980 Living Endow-
ment, in which he explains why
he discontinued giving to
Davidson College. The 600%
rise in energy costs over the
last five years is, according to
Physical Plant Director Grover
Meetze, ‘‘not too far from the
truth.”’ The ad hoc committee
for better education to which
Mr. Dimmock refers was known
as the Coalition for Better
Education.

Dear Davidsonian,
Last year, Davidson com-

pleted its most successful Liv- .

ing Endowment campaign ever,
with total gifts of $632,000.
These gifts—all unrestricted—
were important to Davidson’s
ongoing work and to continu-
ation of its policy of operating
in the black.

Living within one’s means is
increasingly difficult, of course,
for all of us these days, but
Davidson is committed to living
within its means, thus main-
taining its stance of debt-free
operation and fiscal soundness.
To do this the college needs the
help of all of its alumni and
friends.

Because you have given in
the past, we are concerned that
we did not hear from you in
1979. I know there can be many
reasons why people do not give,
but if you have some special
reason which you would like to
share with me please .let me
know.

Davidson needs you— your
counsel and your support.
Please let the college or me hear
from you soon.

Faithfully yours,
B. Frank Matthews, '49

Dear Mr. Matthews,

I am writing to answer the

query posed by your penulti-

mate sentence in your letter of
- May 5 (1980).

I did not contribute to David- .

son last year. because of what I

saw at my fifth college reunion.
Let me elaborate. . .
In response to the energy

_crisis Davidson. installed extra
‘oil storage tanks. On cold: days

windows all over campus are
still wide open to maintain an

even room temperature! Mrs.
Spencer advised me that energy
costs were up some 600% in five
years (how much did your
energy costs escalate in the last
five years?).

The one true thing to be
proud of was the achievement of
the College Bowl team; they
were refused funding by the
College. But, for reasons un-
known to me, an institution so
proud of its academics spends
hundreds of thousands on foot-
ball.

And what about the ad hoc
committee for better educa-
tional standards. The existence
of such a committee is an
embarassment; the non-res-
ponse of the College to such a
committee is a scandal.

My fellow alumni, including
footbal players, lawyers, pro-
fessionals and nonprofessionals
agreed that what they treasured
about Davidson was not who
won the homecoming game. It
was/is people, ideas, teachers, a
way to approach life and live life
fully and sensitively.

When Davidson embraces
these ideas in more than prin-
ciple only, I will stand at the
head of the line to give.

campus, and themselves. Acti-
vities range from working with
underpriveleged children to vis-
iting prisons to building a solar
greenhouse. A student can give
thirty minutes or four years,
thirty cents or $10. Which leads
to the reason for this letter.
Next. Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday (September 22-24),
Y members will be contacting
everyone on campus to inform
them about the Y, to look for
students interested in giving
some time, and to take @dna-
tions for the Y’s fall fund dfive.
We really need your support,
whether time or money, so
please give generously.
Thank you.

Y Service Corps

To the Editor:
“The Y typified the concern
of the Davidson student. It

challenges you to become invol-
ved in the task of building a

better world. It gives you a-

chance to participate in the
special kind of activism that we
have at Davidson—a kind that
calls students down from the
podiums and gives them a

chance to act instead of talk. -

Davidson College offers many

- opportunities for a total educa-

tion. The Y is one of these
opportunities—can you afford
not to become involved?”’

Marshall Guill wrote this as
president of the Y Student
Service Corps over ten years
ago. His statement still expres-
ses the meaning and purpose of
today’s Y.

Far from being a small group»

of ‘‘do-gooders’’, the Y is an
organization that offers every
student:on campus the means to
channel a little time, thought,
and energy into activities that
will benefit. the community,
