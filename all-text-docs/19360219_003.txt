TRAINED BY LA FORGE
Also Credits Wife’s Untiring

Devotion

By ALTON CATES

“What's the matter—got 2
stamach ache?” So spoke
Frank La Forge, ‘when. Law-
rence Tibbett, world-famous
baritone today, first came to
him back in 1922. “You don't
have to make such wry. faces
when you sing. And your
breathing is all wrong. And
‘wind’ is = not pronounced
‘wine’ !”

Right there began as strenuous
and as.thorough a training as ever.
a singer had. La Forge put Tibbett
through the pace. The future op-
eratic.stur_learned to open his
mouth, to sing while taking setting
up exercises, while rolling over
and over on the floor, even while
standing on his head with La Forge
kicking him ta the stomach. And
never again did he say “wine” or
“and-da" er “Holy Ghote.”

Tibbett gives all of the credit of

his spectacular career and his truly
magnificent voice to the gruelling
training received from La Forge
and to the untiring devotion of-his-
wile.
“ Today, Tibbett ranks perhaps as
the greatest living singer, and cer-
tainly as among the greatest of all
time. He is the leading baritone
at the Metropolitan, where he has
been for the past five years. It
was at the Metropolitan that he
made his greatest triumph in the
title rote of Gruenberg's opera “The
Emperor Jones.”

Among his great operatic éharacter-
izations have been Ford from Verdi's
“Falstaff,” Rigoletto from the opera
of that name, also by? Verdi, the clown
and the Ainanasro in
“Aida.”

He is amazingly versatile, and sings
everything (rom operatic gems to some
of the better specimens of *fopular

music. “On the Road to Mandalay.”
“The — Glory Road,” “Shortnin’
Bread," Clouds afe among the songs

he has helped to make well-known.
the Boston clmerican says of him:

_Lawrence-Tibbett is America's great-

est male singer. “Whoever the com-

“poser and whatever the style, Tib-

bett meets the demands of the com-
position in all its varied. aspects; in

vocal tone, in musical phrasing, in

‘clear enunciation, and in dramatic

feeling.” ,
The Chicago Tribune says: “IIe

possesses one of the fine voices of
the present generation, he is a musi-
cian and an artist, and, on top of it
all, he is a personality.” +
Says The Chicago American:
rence Tibbett is one of the most
amazing musical phtnomena of our
time. The art of singmg has no mys-
teries for him. He can do what he
will with his magnificent vocal or-
gans, and he wills to do everything.
In volume he can produce anything
from a divine pianissimo to a thun-

“Law-

ering and unbelievable power.”

Mr. Tibbett has won fame for hint-
self also as a motion picture star. He
was the first operatic star to appear
in pictures, Tle played in “The Ro-
gue Song” and in a film version of
“The [Emperor Jones.” Recently he
appeared in ‘Metropolitan,’ with Vir-
ginia Bruce..

Mr. Tibbett is in love with his
