Questionin' That:

2007: Toxic Waste in the Commons & An All White Davidson?

It is the year 2007, and stu-
dents from the year 1991and1992
gather for a school reunion. We
join our two pontificants, J: and
A:, little older, a little wiser, and
more attuned to the simpler pleas-
ures of life, at the Vail Commons
which is now anuclear waste facil-
ity.

A: So, we’re back at the old
“D.” My how things have changed.
Seems like yesterday when we were
dining in this now defunct cafete-
ria, although the green beans al-
ways did seem flourescent.

J: [knew there had to be some
reason that those green bean cans
were made out of lead. This place
is almost totally different than I
remember it, although Dean Terry
doesn’t look a day older.

A: Hey, Let’s go to the Dean’s
office to look up some of the cur-
rent African American students. It
is hard to imagine that there were
only 65 black people at Davidson
when wewere here. There mustbe
at least a hundred or more now.

J: Yeah, the Dean’s office is a
strong move. Let’s doit.

(Five to ten minutes later in the
Dean’s office),

J: I’m glad to see that they
finally made Mrs. Archie a Dean.
She was the coolest person in the
Office.

A: There’s John Eaves in the
same office, and he still hasaTWA

(Teenie-Weenic-Afro for those
who don’t know the time). Let’s
look up some of these students;
I’m interested to see what things
are like today.

J: Well, here’s the student
directory, butnow that] think about
it, how are we supposed to know
which of these students is black?
Let’s ask Mr. Eaves.

A: Dean Eaves! Hey, remem-
berus, 1992 and 1993, Davidsonian
column “Questionin’ That?” It’s
J: and A:. We’re looking for some
current black students to talk to.
When we left, black students were
making an indelible mark on
Davidson and its future. We want
to know what’s going on.

J: Uh-uh....Uh-huh....You _

don’tsay! Dean Eaves, you’ ve got
tobe putting meon. Do youexpect
me to believe that there is not one
single black student on this entire
campus? I mean, this is 2007, for
crying out loud! Black student
enrollment and graduation rates
have been on therise for the last ten
years! What’s wrong with this
picture?

A: Come to think of it, there
was another development taking
place as we left. The attrition rate
for black students increased for the
same reason that the numbers of
black students stayed consistently
low: Davidson adjusted, but it
didn’tchange. The school seemed

perfectly willing to allow students
to initiate things, but it never ex-
tended beyond itself to meet the
demands of a burgeoning, diverse
group of students. As a conse-

quence, it never changed.

J: Yeah, yeah, I know what
you’re saying. One thing that-
would have pleased many of the
black students that were here then
was for there to have been more
blacks in positions of authority at
Davidson: I recognize that, at that
time, the competition for black ad-
ministrators and faculty was heavy.
However, Davidson made no ef-

fort to hold onto the quality people
that it already had.

When I think of black faculty
and administration members that
were wronged, names like Savan-

der Parker and Arnold James
come to mind. And when the
college wronged them, it simul-
taneously wronged all of the
students that: depended upon
them for guidance and-support.
Losing people like that really
hurt my feelings, and it sensed
that I wasn’t alone in that senti-
ment. ,

A: No you weren’t. Those
developments hurt us and the
school. I couldn’t help feeling a
little strange walking across the
stage at graduation. I was glad to
be walking, to be sure. But Ialso
felt like one day I would return
and find no more black people
and no diversity, and I have!

J: With the benefit of hind-
sight, it’s clear that there were
numerous things that could have

been done to avoid what we’re
seeing now. But then again, many
of us knew then what needed to
happen. Weknew that diversity in ~
numbers did not directly translate
into a diverse environment. We
knew thataction needed tobe taken
to ensure that the mainstream
would reach out and engulf stu-
dents that were outside of it, in-
stead of forcing them to compro-

Beyond Birkenstock: J. Kyle Kinner & Seth J, McLaughlin
In Memory of the Fine Lost Art of Gentle Conversation

When, ata dinner party somewhere,
later in your life, you are asked to
confirm someone else’s opinion
with your own on_a'subject of
which you know not, think back to
this moment and this column, for
we are about to tell you how.

How what?

Why, how to come up with
totally brainless, yet apparently
sensible judgments that no one
could possibly disagree with.
Recall that only insensitive boors
possess the audacity to make a
comfortable = conversation
“strained” by vocal disagreement.
So, the ultimate aim of any “con-
versationalist” must necessarily be
torepackage what you’ ve justheard
ina slightly different, but still rec-
ognizable form, and return it for
your audience’s consumption.
Think of itas sort of like the tennis
your grandparents played. And if
your grandparents didn’t play ten-
nis, or perform any other non-farm
related activity, then you probably
don’t get invited to many parties
anyway (Second Law of Kennedy-
namics).

No, of course we’re going to
explain this metaphor. Our grand-
parents didn’t play tennis either.
But just take our word that in the
“good” ole days (as opposed to the
“bad” ole days in which we cur- :
rently reside), our forefathers and
foremothers wore white tennis *
“togs” from Abercrombie & Fitch,
including a sweater and blazer.
Women really have come a long
way ... baby. Go try wearing a

white, ankle-length wool skirt in
July for an hour or so and say hello
to Mr. Heat-Stroke for us while
you're at it.

Now the point. Because of this
medieval sportswear, the game of
tennis itself tended to be more
stately and decorous (or ponder-

ous and dull, depending on who

you ask); the game was slow, and
your grandmother could still play
that version outatthe home. People
would feed one another a series of
lobs with roughly the excitement
level of the Seventies computer
classic “Pong.”

What, you may still be asking
yourselves, does this infinite di-
gression have to do with my ability
to dither away the hours in futile
conversation, anyway?

A lot.

- Grandmother’s tennis partner
represents the person who you, as
an imbecile, would ideally want to
attract in some post-buffet, pre-
Cappacino conversation. Imagine
yourself, suitably attired (though
you always did dress alittle flashy)
and strategically situated to the
rear of that potted rubber tree,
hoping against hope that the bar
stays open another hour, or barring
that, someone will stagger over
and talk to you. :

Oh, look . . . over there in that
knot of intelligent and vivacious
people, its Henry Kissenger (the
perennial dinner guest). Is that

statesman really coming
towards you? Does he truly want
to hear your opinions on foreign

policy or the Nixon years? Can
this be happening to you?

Of course not, don’t be stupid.
Henry wouldn’t budge from that
clump of shiny, happy people if
Mikhail Gorbachev walked
through the door. They’re syco-
phants, silly. Hosts pay those
people by the hour to surround and
flatter the formerly famous. Why
else.do you think anyone would
invite Robin Leachinto their home?

Meanwhile, back at the potted
plant, someone appears willing to
talk to you. Quick, purse your lips
and knot your brow inasemblance
of intelligence. Try holding your
wine glass up to your nose and

"sniffing. Withany luck, he’ll think

you’re a connoisseur or a vintner,
Whatever you do, don’t compare
the wine’s bouquet to “Mad Dog”
or “Thunderbird” no matter how
much it reminds you of skid row.
He might be the caterer and at-
tempt to kill you.

In fact, itisn’tthecatereratall,
but someone you actually know.
The great coincidence machine of
life being what it is, you are just as
likely to meet your remedial ed.
teacher from fourth grade as you
are to meet a peer who lives in the
same city. Better safe than sorry,
we’ll state the four laws of social
contact governing strangers you
know (they carry the same weight
as those governing the physical
universe).

- 1) Whenever you meet some-
one who you don’t even vaguely
recall, the other party will invari-

ably address you by your firstname.

2) Upon perceiving that you
do not remember them, the of-
fended party will immediately
begin to rub it in, alluding to your
age or other infirmity that would
cause you to forget “‘the good times
we had together.”

3) Nine times out of ten, you
will leave these conversations
without having aclear understand-
ing of who you were speaking to.

4) The other person, who for

some reason still knows folks from

the same forgotten era, will now
proceed to tell these people that
you have apparently contracted
Parkinson’s, since who could pos-
sibly forget those “‘good times”
otherwise.

For the sake of argument,
however, we will assume that the
person now addressing you has
been so loosened by drink as to
ignore the normally inviable social
laws. Why, what a surprise, its
your dad’s insurance agent from
when you were ten, who has moved
uptoselling commercial coverage
and would like very much to show
you some literature.

You make some small excuse
about having to take your Prozac
and move away quickly. _,

Good, you’re learning a good.
lesson: choose your victim. A
woman near the bar wearing only
one shoe looks promising. She
might be too tanked to protest a
good conversation. You sidle up,
prepared for her to belch in your
face. Instead, you find her quite

mise their character in order to fit
in. I guess nobody listened until it
was too late.

A: Hey, J:, did we ever com-
promise our characters being here
for four years?

J: My answer to that question
is that there was no,other way for
students like us to survive at a
place like this. What a pity.

A: Yeah, that isa pity, and you
know what else is a pity, I have a
date with Lisa Cooley, so I’ll have
to break out on you.

J: If that’s a pity, I need more
sympathy in my life. Peace.

A: Peace

(Amessage from the year 2007:
The black student exodus depicted
in this column has already begun.
The scenario presented here is very
possible and perhaps even very
likely. If diversity is our goal, as-
similation is NOT the answer. Only
true integration will make things
work. That means everybody
giving a little, so that we can all,
gain a lot. But we’ve got to start
today.) .

P.S., The Dean John Eaves
depicted in this column is purely
fictional, and any resemblance to
actual persons, living or. working
inRoom 104 Chambers, isentirely
coincidental.

Finally, a special shout! out to
Sterling Freeman, who provided
the inspiration for this column.

sober and willing to talk. It seems
she threw her shoe to ward off the
aforementioned insurance sales-
man. Quite a mind, that.

You talk. She lobs an easy one
your way. “Isn’t this economy
dreadful? Can you believe how
Reagan and his cronies screwed
this nation . . . spend, spend,
spend.” (Here, she clucks disap-
provingly and eyes you squarely.)

_ Now we’ve reached the pro-

- verbial fork in your decision tree.

The ball (pardon the mixed-meta-
phor) is in yourcourt. Your heart,
and whatever’s left of your mind
after all those Fuzzy Navelsis tell-
ing you that, wait a minute, Re-
agan. ONLY SPENT THE
MONEY THAT THOSE DEMO-
CRATS IN -CONGRESS AP-
PROPRIATED. And, my good-
ness, WINNING THE COLD
WAR was no mean feat . . . cheap
at half the price!

Do you stand up for the truth
and defend Ronald Reagan? Do
you site the impressive statistics
from that period and remind her
that recessions are an unavoidable
correction in the business cycle
that was statistically worse under
CARTER? Are you HONEST?

Of course not. This is social

conversation, you fool. Ultimately,

your goal is to be perceived to be
just as intelligent, and just as
“sensitive” to the victims of Re-
agan.as she is. Swallow the truth
whole if you have to. But, for
goodness sake, appear sensible.

You nod and say, “Terrible,
isn’t it?”
