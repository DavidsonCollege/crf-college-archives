Erik Ruud Of Norway
Studies At Davidson

By TOM

Early in September 1952 a
young Norwegian, named Erik
Ruud, applied for a scholarship for
a year's ‘study in the United
States. He was one of more than
3,000 who responded to the same
newspaper announcement. Out of
this group 25 were selected by the
Norwegian government, among
them Erik Ruud. They were select-
ed for their ability to speak Eng-
lish and their knowledge of
American History.

These 25 men were then pro-
eessed by the State Department,
which in turn selected ten of
them, one to go to each of the
ten colleges at which arrange-
ments had been made for the stu-
dents.

As has been the custom for the
past few years, some fraternity
here has sponsored a_ student's
visit on the campus. This year
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity as-
sumed that responsibility. They
are paying for Erik’s room, board,
and books. The college in turn is
paying tuition and laboratory fees.

Erik has been in this country
for nine weeks. His first six weeks
were spent at Yale University,
where he took introductory
courses in American Sociology,
Architecture, Literature, and His-
tory. As part of his indoctrination
he was taken on a number of tours
in New England.

When he arrived here, he had

never heard of Davidson, and he
had heard very little about North
Carolina. He knew very little about
American History or Geography.

Having landed at New York, he
was immediately impressed by the
city and especially Time's Square.
He had never seen so many people
at one time. Although Oslo, his
home town, has a population of
500,000, it is the largest city in the
world in land area,

One of the first things that he
noticed here was the marked
similarity between all Ameri-
can cities whether in New
England or in the South. He was
struck by the uses to which neon
lights are put here. In Norway
they are considered very ugly, and
their use is restricted by munici-
pal ordinance. Despite the simi-
larity between the physical ap-
pearance of the towns, he feels
that life is considerably slower in
the South than in the North.

Lutheranism is the official state
religion in Norway. It is for this
reason, he feels, that so little em-
phasis is placed on religion. Prac-
tically no one attends church
there. He was deeply impressed
and surprised by the emphasis
placed on church-going here and
the large number of denomina-
tions.

At the present Erik is an eco-
nomics major. He is planning to
go either into banking or the
shipping business when he grad-
uates. Although only 18, he is
classified as a junior here. He will
be at Davidson for one year, and
if his progress and grades war-
rant it, possibly two. Upon his re-
turn he will serve one year in the
Universal Military Training Sys-
tem of Norway. He hopes to be
an English interpreter.

His comparisons of the Ameri-
can and Norwegian educational
systems are interesting. A boy
first attends seven years of ele-
mentary school followed by five
years of high school. Study of
English is begun in the sixth
grade. Their high schools are con-
sidered so good that Davidson Col-
lege accredited him for one year
of college work.

Following high school he at-
tended the Oslo Commercial Col-
lege for one year. It is considered
average for a student to attend
classes 40 hours a week. In gen-
eral he considers European col-
leges to be harder than those here.
There is no social or extra-curricu-
lar life. One goes to school for
study and nothing else. There are
no dormitories. Students stay in
fixed classes with the teachers ro-
tating. Original and independent
thought is especially stressed and
is absolutely necessary for a high
grade.

Here he finds that you can
study if you want to. He was im-
pressed by the social life, the gym,
athletics, and fraternity life. How-
ever, he would not commit himself
on whether he considered the
American system better than the
European. In Europe there is no
time during terms of school for
any work at all. .

However, it is the custom for
boys to get summer jobs. He has
worked as a longshoreman, waiter,
porter, and in a tobacco factory.
He also served as an interpreter
for the 1952 Winter Olympics. A
wage of 70 cents an hour is con-
sidered high in Norway.

Soccer, skiing, and ice hocky are
the three main sports there. It is
not unusual for snow to be on
the ground from November to
March, or to have a snow six feet
deep, or a temperature of —20
degrees F. An average fal] day
here compares with the hottest
summer day there.

Although there is no television
in Norway, he was impressed by
the poor technical quality of our
television as compared with that
of England. Nevertheless, he en-
joys watching the programs, as
well as drinking Coca-Colas.

He particularly appreciates all
of the good will and understand-
ing that has been shown him while
at Davidson.

“We don’t claim Cupidity as one

of our services,” sighed Williams
modestly, “but couples who have
found a warmth, companionship,
and community of interest in the
magazine form the backbone of
our society.”
_ “In fact, people have told us,”
he added, blushing, “that a joint
subscription to Seripts ‘n Pranks
is the best ice-breaker since orchids
were invented.”

“Of course, we don't believe
that, but a joint subscription is
much less expensive. And nobody
has kept this quarterly Valentine
in the refrigerator yet!”

In addition to the reduced prices
offered girl friends and parents,
seldiers will receive the magazine
for half price. ‘Free subscriptions

attainment and other activities and

given to candidates who combine
high academic ability with the ca-
pacity to play an active part at
the university of their choice.

Under the terms of the awards,
each of four regional committees
in the United States—East, South,
Middle West, and Pacific—will
select three candidates every year,
with three in reserve. These names
will be forwarded for approval
to the Advisory Council in Wash-

tinguished Americans who will
assist the British Ambassador,
Chairman of the Council, in re-
viewing and approving the candi-
dates.

The closing date for the appli-
cations for 1954-55 scholarships is
November 1, 1953. For further in-

After two national tours he was
awarded a scholarship at the Phila-

where he studied for four years
under the pianist and teacher, Ed-

Maxin continued his concert activ-

ther recognized by a grant from
the Olga Samaroff Memorial
Foundation.

In May of 1953, Jack Maxin was
chosen from among thirty pianists

ting settled in their rooms, the
boys will meet their dates for a
supper hike up one of the moun-
tain trails where a picnic supper
will be enjoyed by one of the re-
freshing mountain streams.

Perhaps the highlight of Mon-
treat-Davidson day will be the big
party planned to be held in How-
erton Hall following the supper
hike. There will be ample oppor-
tunity for round dancing, square
dancing, and folk games.

The program for Sunday morn-

impressive Gaither Chapel. After
lunch the homeward journey will
begin so that the students will get
back to the campus in plenty of

time for Vespers.

For about fifty students the

they are going to see the colorful
turning of the mountain leaves,
to enjoy fun with the fairer sex,
or just to see the Presbyterian
summer conference site, the group
that leaves from the Student
Union at 2 o'clock tomorrow aft-

end.
