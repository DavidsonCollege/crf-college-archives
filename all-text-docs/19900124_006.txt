INDIA, from page 4

kick out of him.

Kirk Williams in India
I wanted to go abroad, but I
had already seen most of Eu-
rope. India was a place hard to
get to unless you planned
ahead.

I had envisioned India as
having extensive poverty, so I
wasn’t shocked upon witness-
ing it. Indians see Americans as
very wealthy and friendly.
They have a low opinion of
American women. They often
picture themas harlotsbecause
of the American movies they

see.

When in India, you some-
times cannot get American
products. India does not have
Coca Cola; instead they have
Campa Cola, which is sweeter.
Fruit drinks are more popular
in India. American television is
almost never seen because of
the language barrier. They get
some low quality American
and foreign films. I was really
shocked to see “Batman” come
out in video in October whenit
was a movie just that summer.

Our Davidson group stayed
at Madras Christian College,
which is in southwest India.
The men stayed at the houses of
the college president and the

program director, while the

women lived at the guest
house. The whole group ate
their meals at the guest house,
which was also our meeting
place.

The group spent a month
traveling in northern India.
The South was more conserva-
tive, with few tourists and less
westernized. In places, the
North was overrun by tourists.
Our group enjoyed the days
spent at the town of Ooty, a
British Hill Station. The alti-
tude there was 7,300 feet, and
the 50-degree cloudy tempera-
tures were very refreshing.

We had one week to travel by
ourselves. I. went with Jay

Wylie and Sabrina Khan to Ka-
shmir, a city in the northwest.
Kashmir is beautiful and much
greener than most of India. The
Indians there are Muslim and
are seeking independence.

I had one particularly fright-
ening experience during my
stay in India. One day after
walking through Rajasthan, an
abandoned fort, I discovered
that there was no transporta-
tion to take me to the bottom of
the mountain. I was really
scared because I had to walk
through a bad neighborhood;
furthermore, it was getting
dark and I was carrying a lot of
money.

drenconstantly grabbing atmy
pockets for valuables. The cit-
ies were constantly noisy. It
was hard for me to relax. Even
in the park, people would come
up to me and ask me about
myself and my country.

I enjoyed the temple in Sri
Brahadeshuara, which gave
me a special religious feeling.
Negarkat, Nepal was a very
relaxing place. The temple is.
about 8,000 feet tall.

One night I saw the most in-
credible sunset I had ever seen
overlooking the Himalayas.
The next morning I rose at 5:30
to see the most beautiful sun- |
rise I will probably ever wit-
ness.
