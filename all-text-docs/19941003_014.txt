THE DAVIDSONIAN

Volleyball builds
confidence with wins

By Jonathan Whitcomb

According to coach Carolyn
Blake, this season for the women’s
volleyball team has actually been
two seasons,

The first was a growing expe-
rience for the young team (8 fresh-
men, 2 sophomores, 2 upperclass-
men) in which they played top-
notch teams such as North Caro-
lina, South Carolina and Georgia
Tech.

The Wildcats went 0-11 in
that first part of the sesaon, but
they. learned from their mistakes
and entered the Southern Confer-
ence schedule with high hopes.

Last week, Davidson defeated
Western Carolina three games to
two and Tennessee-Chattanooga
3-1. Setter Lorie Logan played
well all-around, and middle blocker

Shea Green had-some powerful
kills. Also, Michelle Augustin
stepped up with an excellent jump
serve and some timely kills.

The Cats later lost to UNC-
Wilmington, but their record stood
at 3-12 and they seemed to gain
conference heading into the heart
of the conference schedule.

Blake also said that Paola Leal,
middle blocker Tara Smith and

freshman Amy Bourgeois played .

very well.

While the team has struggled
at times this year, Blake feels that
strong recruiting classes will com-
bine this year’s youngsters to pro-
duce a powerful squad.

This week, the Cats take on
conference rivals Furman and Ap-
palachian State at home in their
quest for the conference title.

Davidson wins wild rugby
contest with overtime triumph

By Graham Powell

The Davidson Rugby Club
came out on top in two rugby con-
tests against Appalachian State on
Saturday.

The tough play of the for-
wards got the ball into the hands of
scrum half David Derrick, who
managed to distribute the ball to
the backs under high pressure from
the Mountaineers.

Controversy erupted when
Pete Scholze took a pass, ran di-
agonally for the corner of the tri-
zone, and-beat several ASU play-
ers for an apparent score, The
linesman, who may not have told
the truth, called Scholze out of
bounds and disallowed the tri. Play
had to be stopped minutes later
» when an Appalachian player suf-
fered a compound fracture, stop-
ping play for thirty minutes.

In the second half, Tom
Shelburne*came out hitting hard
and intimidated the opposing side
with tough defense. Davidson
maintained strong possession, and
pushed upfield with experienced
Simon Priestley’s accurate kick-
ing. Despite tough play across the
board, Davidson did not manage to
score by the end of regulation.

Cats gear up
for cockfight

Florida International. This
Thursday’s game will be big for

Davidson when they take on the #7 -

South Carolina.

After dropping their first two
games to #1 Indiana and #8 St.
Louis, they have yet to lose again
with wins over strong opponents
like Rutgers. South Carolina re-
turns seven starters from last year’s
Final Four squad and has become
stronger.

The Wildcats will have to start
being more careful. Four of the 18
goals surrendered this season have
been penalty kicks. Fan: support
will be important for the Wildcats
to be victorious, so come support
your Wildcats before leaving for
Fall Break.

Just minutes into sudden death
overtime, however, Hank
Ackerman took a pass from Frank
Killian and surged twenty yards
into the tri-zone. -Ackerman’s
game-winning run was aclimactic
finish toa long, hard fought match.

Davidson dominated the sec-
ond game, winning off of a penalty
kick courtesy of Simon Priestley.
Brian Blythe played well in the
scrum and Scott Burklvardt’s run-
ning was key in the backfield.
Strong defense shut out Appala-
chian State once again, rendering
them scoreless and winless for the
day.

Women's soccer turns it around

By Lee Brumby

The Davidson Women’s Soc-
cer team snappeed a five game
losing streak Saturday by beating
UNC-Ashville 4-0. The Cats:
struggled earlier in the week against
anew Wake Forest team, falling to
the Demon Deacons 2-1.

Several players contributed to
the Cats offense in last week’s
games. Ellen Sprinkle provided a
goal in both contests and an assist
in the Ashville game. Claudia
Lombard, Kelly Schmidt, and
Kelly Ammann each added a goal
in Saturday’s action while
Lombard, Schmidt, Sarah Cantrell
and Amy Lindstrom each had an
assist. Melissa Moser recorded the
lone assist in the Wake game.

According to Coach Hundley,
“We were disappointed to let the
win slide by in the game. The team

looked past the Wake Forest game
because of their record and results
this season. We got in the hole
down 2-0 in the first half and
learned the lesson about playing
the entire game.”

The Cats learned quickly and
played hard the entire game against
Ashville. Midfielder Melissa
Moser was thrilled with Saturday’s
result. “Hopefully the win is the
turning point of the season and
we’ ll win the rest of our games this
season.”

Coach hundley’s team, now
2-7, 1-0 in the Southern Confer-
ence, has struggled with putting
the ball in the back of the net this
season. Last year’s leading scorer

Claudia Lombard has five goals in :
the Cat’s first nine games, and last
year’s second leading scorer
Heather Wineburg has yet to score.

The team’s bright spot this
season has been senior goalkeeper
Liz Schaper, according to Hundley.
He’s pleased with the progress of
the defense because, “If we’re
going to struggle scoring, we must
keep the ball out of our net..”

The women’s soccer team has
now completed the most difficult
stretch of the schedule. The team’s
nexttwo games, Appalachian State
Sunday and Furman Wednesday,
are Southern Conference contest
and will set the tone for the rest of
the season. :
