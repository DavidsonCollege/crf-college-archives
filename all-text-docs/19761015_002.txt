Mrs Ava Spencer, who was

appointed by her -husband

college president Samuel R.

Spencer Jr., to supervise the
project, said that, when
completed, the new dining
room will definitely be ‘‘the
most elegant on campus’’.

Although commonly re-
ferred to as the Woodrow
Wilson Room, Spencer said
that no final action had been
taken on a name.

Baskin outlines SGA Senate goals,
four main areas merit consideration

By LYMAN COLLINS
Assistant News Editor

According to SGA Presi-
dent Bo Baskin, the four main
goals for the SGA Senate for
the rest of this year will be in
the areas of athletics, over-
crowding, faculty/student re-
lationships, and program de-
velopment.

.‘These are four broad areas
that we have been working in
for a long time now,’’ said
Baskin, ‘‘and we also have
several ad- hoc projects now. in
the works.’

In the area of athletics =

Baskin said that’ ‘the SGA
wanted to work with ‘the
Athletics Department in their
areas of P.E., club, sports,
intramurals, and intercollegi-
ate athletics.

‘‘We want to help the de-
partment define its goals for
all these areas,”’ he said. ‘““The
goals for intercollegiate sports
have been pretty well defined,
but that is not quite the case
with club sports, for exam-
ple.”’

Baskin indicated that in the
area of overcrowding the SGA
would be looking at all aspects
of the problem not just in one
area such as housing.

“We want to look at over-
crowding from all sides, from
housing to classrooms, park-
ing to eating houses (both
Patterson Court and ARA).

“The basic question here is
given current enrollment, do

we have adequate facilities, or
given current facilities, what
should be our enrollment?”

Baskin said that he was par-
ticularly interested in the area
of faculty/student relation-
ships.

“I think we have an excel-
lent faculty, it is what makes
Davidson great,” he said.

But Baskin said he thought
that some of the intimacy of
faculty/student relationships
had disappeared. ' a hat’ Ss one
of the things you | ways hear
about Davidson—the way. the
students visit often in the
faculty homes and the great
relationship that exists. I’m
afraid that we are too often
only getting contact in the
classrooms.’’

‘‘T also think that it is a
two-way street; students don’t
invite faculty to their eating
clubs or parties.”’

He indicated that a possible
way of both faculty and stu-

dents discovering more mut- —

ual interests was for booklets
on both faculty and student
nonacademic interests to be
developed similar to the one on
faculty academic interests now
used for extended studies.

‘‘Another problem in this
area is student evaluation of
faculty. The SIR forms have
been discontinued and the
SGA just can’t handle it; there
is an incredible amount of
paperwork,”’ he added.

In the area: of program

development Baskin pointed
to the vast potential in audio-
visual aids that are for the
most part untapped here.

Baskin also pointed to the
Senate ad-hoc activity.

“‘We have one group work-
ing on the life at Davidson.
They meet each week and
discuss a different topic, and
in January they are turning a
report,’’ he said.

“We wanted this group to
challenge even the most hal-
lowed. institutions here.”

Coeducation is another area
that has fallen under SGA
scrutiny.

““We have a committee stu-

This committee is going to

who have done away with the
quotas and discover what the
results have been in areas such
as alumni giving,” added Bas-
kin.

Improved student/Senate
communications have now
been improved on according to
Baskin. Starting this week
every Senator is responsible
for visiting about forty stu-
dents and seeing if they have
any gripes, suggestions or
ideas. Then the individual
Senators are to report back to
the Senate where it is sent to
the proper committee for act-
ion. Then-the Senators are to
report back to their ‘‘consti-
tuents’’ and inform them what
action had been taken. Then

—_the Senators are-given-a new

group of names and the pro-
cess begins again.

“The purpose of this system
is to hear complaints, estab-
lish a line of communications
between the students and the
Senate, and to educate them
about what the Senate is
doing,’’ said Baskin. ‘‘I hope
we can dispel some of the fears
about what the SGA is

the possibility of running it.
While there would be obvious
advantages of Scott operating
it, such as his experience in
both food and staff manage-
ment, the students presently
involved in the project are
generally in favor of running it
themselves.

antiques provide
~ elegance for Wilson Room

Grover Meetze designed the
room as a part of his

tion of the Grey library into a
student union. The area of the
Wilson Room was originally
taken up by library offices.

Music Professor Lucille
Snider is in charge of the
actual decorating of the room.
However, because she is still
in the middle of her plans she
declined to comment upon how
the room will appear when
completed.

Antique furniture given by
the estate of Mrs. Florence
Clift Horton in memory of her
son, Davidson alumnus
Gordon Horton ’54, will
provide the focal point of the
room’s decoration. According
to Mrs Spencer all of these
pieces are in the Eighteenth
Century English style.

In addition to furniture, the
silver, crystal, and china to be
used are also from the Horton
Estate.

Other Horton valuables
have already been used in the
refurbishing of the Carnegie
Guest House. There is an
exhibit of Horton jade and
silver in the’ E.H. Little
Library.

Mrs Spencer described work
on the Wilson Room as being
“in progress,’’ although she
doesn’t kow exactly when ‘‘we
will get everything into the
room.”

Past college dinners have
been held in the Ney Room,
located in Rusk House. The
fate of the Ney Room upon
completion of the Wilson
Room is uncertain.

There is a strong chance,
according to Dean of Students
Will H. Terry, that Rusk
House will be used to establish
a new eating club or fraternity
in order to eliminate  ver-
crowding on Patterson Court.
If this does not meterialize,
