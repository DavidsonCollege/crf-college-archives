ae

On Saturday night at 8:30
P. M., in the auditorium of
Salem College in Winston-
Salem, the Davidson College
Symphonic Band gave a most
successful concert under the
direction of Prof. James C.
Pfohl.

This concert was one of the larg-
est which the band, now  in_ its
fourth season, has ever played, and
the audience was termed as one of
the most receptive that has ever
heard the band — which fact is evi-
dent by the many encores.

The opening number was “Cho-
rale and Fugue in G Minor” by

Bach-Abert. Next the band was
heard in “Serenade Roccoco” by
Meyer-Helmund and “Amparito

Poco” by Texidor. The concluding
number of the first half of the pro-
gram was the dashing “Hungarian
Fantasy” by Liszt, in which the
piano soloist was Mrs. Louise Nel-
son Pfohl. Mrs. Pfohl gave an en-
core “Valse” by Chopin,

Opening the second half of the
program the band played the mod-
ern “Manhattan Serenade” by Alter.
Then came Caillet’s “Strains from
Erin,” which combines the melo-
dies of various Irish tunes, and
Dvorak’s lilting ‘“Humoreske.” The
final number on the program was
the crashing “Marche Slave” by
Tschaikowsky.

The encores dispersed among the
two parts of the program were
“Colonel Bogey March” by Alford,
which was conducted by Joseph
Pfohl, director of the Winston-
Salem high school band, “London
Suite,” by. Vail, “Glow Worm” by
Lincke, during which small torches
were lighted in different instru-
ments of the band, “New Colonial
March” by Hall, and-“Cheerio,” by
Goldman.
with “O Davidson!” which was con-
ducted by Master Vernon Clarke
Lassiter, who, although only three
-years old, appeared last fafl as
drum major with the Davidson
college football band.

During the intermission the audi-
ence was entertained by two num-
bers given by the quartet. They
were “My Little Banjo” by Dich-
mont and “Mrs, Winslow’s Soothing
Syrup” by Harrington,

Two moving pictures were
shown to the Chemistry and
Physics students in the Chem-

night. ‘Each of these was a
two-reel picture.
The first picture shown was

“Jewels of Industry.” This picture
had been shown previously at Dav-
idson. It dealt with the manufac-
ture of aloxite and carborundum,
Dr. Acheson, the discoverer of car-
borundum, illustrated how he first
found this new substance: It also
showed the manufacture of crystals
of aloxite in huge furnaces. It takes
an iron ball weighing one ton, drop-
ped twenty feet, to break one of
these large pigs of aloxite.

The second picture was “The
Wonderworld of Chemistry.” This
picture is distributed by the Du-
Pont Company. It the

articles used in every-day life from
