_ one ‘exist in the house.

7. Any house expressing
its desire to remain in oge-
ration under these guidelines
shall be guaranteed a house
through the academic year
1971-72. It is anticipated that
houses operating in 1971-72

will continue to operate’ as

ble.

erations, future assignment -

would be on the basis of a
well conceived financial plan

courage faculty te partici-
pate in the eating and social

ed to decide whether it de-
sires the services of a house-
mother. The college should,
however, reserve the right
to hire a hostess-dietician to
serve a maximum of four
houses, not desiring a house-
mother, the cost being borne

“I can only feel that the result of a system which
eliminates the heartache felt by a number of our
students would represent a great advance for our

sense of community.”

on. the basis of individual
arrangement with the social
organization. (However, to
prevent financial exclusive-
ness, the college will have
the option to set limits on
such charges.

serve as a collection agency

tinue to offer assistance in

iB. Financial:

1. It is recommended that
the college establish a cen-
tral buying office. The man-
ager of this office would be
employed by’ the college in
consultation with the eating
houses.

He would work with the
houses to guarantee proper
diet and quality control as
well as variety and creativi-
ty in menu planning. Menus
would be’ neither standardiz-

ed or unified, Houses would
not be limited to thé. ser-
vices of this office, but the
large. savings available in
wholesale buying would, we
feel, assure their voluntary
participation.

This manager might also
assist the houses in the
maintenance of -equipment
and act as their agent, where
desired, in matters dealing

~ with kitchen personnel.

2. Students shall state their
intentions as to where they
will eat for an entire term
for purposes of guidance in
buying food quantities.

3. The college shall require
a monthly financial report
prepared by the treasurer of
each house. . :

4. Houses shall continue to
manage and control them-
selves, certainly as to social
activities and food. services.
The houses shall continue
election of their managment,
i. e@., those who- serve as
their financial agents.

GUIDELINES
REGARDING

It is important that these
a final solution. The dong-
range plans of -the Student
‘Life Committee Report on
Secial Life should bé con-
stantly reexamined.

The true future of David-
son social life. lies in small
group living in residence
halls. and small group eat-
ing in dining halls. The So-
cial Patterns Commission,
the AED, and the Student
Life Committee have been
particularly aware of this
fact.
