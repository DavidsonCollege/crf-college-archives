Mellencamp's music evolves into mature "Human Wheels"

John Mellencamp deserves
credit for doing more than just
sticking around. It’s been over a
decade since the song “Jack and
Diane” made him a “rising star”
with the likes of such forgettable
flashes as Laura Branigan and Soft
Cell. Back then he was John Cou-
gar, and his specialty was rousing
pop anthems about life in the Mid-
west. What separated him and a
small handful of others from the
newcomers of the early 80s was
his talent. He had a lot of it, unlike
the one-hit wonders and half-baked
acts that got in line.to collect their
15 minutes of fame.

Now he prefers to be called by
his real name, John Mellencamp.
After a few listens to his new al-
bum, Human Wheels, I'll call him
whatever he requests. His music,
like his name, -has evolved
slowly—almost imperceptibly—
into something new. Thirty sec-
onds of the opening song, “When
Jesus Left Birmingham,” should
be proof enough. Its drums are:
muted, restrained and funky— in
other words, the exact opposite of

the boom of “Small Town.” His
rusty whispers of “When Jesus left
Birmingham all the disciples went
crazy...” are preceded by spooky
gospel moans and a mandolin riff.
This is definitely not the same man

who used to just “hurt so good.”
The tight sound of Human

Wheels is the most notable break

from his previous work. Though

- heisstill working with many of the

same musicians that he worked
with in the 80s, Mellencamp has
the sounds they make under more
control than before. The drums are
crisp, the vocals are hushed, and
all the other instruments are used
only when needed. The sound is
funky, but somehow intimate—
much like U2’s Achtung Baby, but
without as much excess noise. In

_. “Junior,” the simple rhythm is

shaker.

“Sweet Evening Breeze” be-
gins with acoustic guitar but soon
kicks into a chaotic beat accentu-
ated by moaning electric guitars.
It’s an example of Mellencamp
turning away from any traces of
his past.

His lyrics are a similarly radi-
cal and conscious departure from
the past. For “Beige to Beige,” a
commentary about the subtlety of

modern racism, he ironically pulls
out such folksy instruments as a
fiddle and penny whistle while
declaring, “Charlie’s gonna look
out for you— you just do what’s
expected of you.”

The imagery used for “Case
795 (The Family),” as a man mur-
ders his wife, is stunning: “He left
her bleeding on the floor in the
kitchen with cake on her fingers
and her wedding ring holding.”

The intensity of his lyrics is con-
tained perfectly in the tight, spar-
ing arrangements of the music.

While I will admit that Hu-
man Wheels is not necessarily the
best album in the Mellencamp cata-
log, it does show that the man can
still make good music. And even
more surprising, Human Wheels
proves that, atover 40 years ofage,
an individual can continue to ma-
ture.
