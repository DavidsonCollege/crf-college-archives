THE DAVIDSONIAN

SGA
President
to be
elected

one week
earlier

By Jay Jennings

In a move to help ease the
transition for newly-elected SGA
presidents, the SGA changed the
date of the elections in the spring
semester. The elections were pre-
viously held on the fourth Monday
of the spring semester and wll now
be held on the third Monday.

A problem existed with the
old date because the president did
not have time to get established
and sworn in before the Board of
Trustees meeting. Thus, the former
SGA president normally went to
the first trustee meeting of the
spring semester, and the new presi-
dent did not have time to get ac-
quainted with the board.

With the new date, SGA presi-
dents will have a chance to begin
their relationship with the trustees
before the April trustee meetings.

The new date also means that
the filing deadline for the elections
will be the second Thursday of the
spring semester instead of the third
Thursday.

Thus, students should contem-
plate elections over the holidays
because the deadline comes so soon
after the start of the spring semes-
ter.

Must college president be Presbyterian?
Debate continues at student/faculty dinner

By Matthew Eirich

Sixteen students and seven
faculty and adminstrators gathered
Tuesday night in the Vail Com-
mons conference room to discuss
whether the president of Davidson
College must be a Presbyterian or
be willing to become one in order
to hold the office. More specifi-
cally, the group discussed the by-
law in the Davidson College con-
stitution which states that the presi-
dent must be “a loyal and active
churchman, giving evidence by his
life of the strength of his Christian
faith and commitment. Such faith
and commitment will be appropri-
ately expressed by his affiliation
with the Presbyterian Church in
the United States, and his active

participation in the life of the Col-
lege Church.”

After dinner, the group was
addressed by the moderator, who
handed out two pages. The first
contained the by-law requiring that
the president be Presbyterian; the
second page was of two articles
printed in The Davidsonian deal-
ing with the topic under discus-
sion.

The first speaker saw the de-
bate as “whether the president
should have to be Presbyterian, not
if he can be.” This point was not
contested, and other issues were
brought to the floor.

One of the issues of concern
was how the current presidential
requirements hinder the diversifi-

cation of Davidson. According to
one participant, there are 1.5 mil-
lion Presbyterians in the United
States, 20,000 of whom hold doc-
toral degrees. Additionally, only
0.6% of Presbyterians are African-
American, and an even smaller
percentage will go on to receive
Ph.D.s. The question was asked:
“What are the odds of an African:-
American ever being president of

Davidson given the current by-
laws?”

The senalanninan issue was
tradition. Some feared that to

change the by-laws would change
the character of the school, which
they saw as shaped by its religious

Westheimer in conjunction with
several other campus groups, such
as SHOC. The Women’s Issues
Committee was disappointed when
Dr. Ruth canceled her planned per-
sonal appearance at their post-lec-
ture discussion group, but had a
good hour and a half discussion
anyway, said Orsbon. They dis-
cussed points made by Dr. Ruth
that were the most meaningful to
them, such as the emphasis on the
female sexual experience.

one was able to glean some per-
sonal meaning from Dr. Ruth’s
chat. Asonesenior says, “I thought
Dr. Westheimer’s visit was just

what this campus needed. I don’t
think the majority of students here
are entirely comfortable with the

subject of sex, and it is this bring-

ing of such touchy issues into the
open that will allow Davidson to
mature as an environment for
healthy relationships.”

NCSL

much more
than just
dressing up

By Randy Hartwell
At Davidson, where “real-
world experience” often seems
tough to come by, the North Caro-
lina Student Legislature gets about
as close as you can get. Modeled
on the actual North Carolina State
Legislature, with a House of Rep-
resentatives and a Senate, the NCSL
is run completely by students from
15 public and private colleges and
universities across the state.
Onceamonth, meetings called
“interim councils” take place at
host colleges, where participants
debate currentissues and form reso-
lutions. These meetings then cul-
minate in annual sessions in which
bills are passed for submission to
the real state legislature.
Davidson delegate Stephen
Feely says, “It is role playing, but
it’s taken very seriously ... it’s like
watching C-Span, but much more
exciting.” The NCSL has recently
debated such controversial topics
as physician-assisted suicide, do-
mestic violence, and the forcing of
welfare mothers to get Norplant, a
semi-permanent form of birth con-
trol. They have even “legalized”
gay marriage and adoption.

was elected Speaker of the House

every part of the politcal spectrum
is represented. That’s one of the
best things about it,” she adds.
“There are all kinds of ideas, but
they’re never judged unfairly.”
Feely agrees: “Debates are heated,
but everyone’s still polite.”

The next interim council will
take place at ASU November 18
through 20, and the 58th Annual °
Legislative Session will be in Ra-
leigh in March of next year.
