Although Davidson's 12
national fraternities must de-
cide on the recommendations
of the’ Committee of Eigh-
teen by December 15, a ma-
jority Of the fraternities have
already made their decision.

The status of the fraterni-
ties as of press time are as
follows:

Alpha Tau Omega. voted
t@ accept the college’s plan,
keep their charter, and re-
main’ in their house, accord-
ing to John Bolinger, ATO
president.

“Our national fraternity
states that each ‘chapter,
may decide their member.
ship procedures within their
own bylaws; consequently
W¥ have to make a minor
change in our bylaws to con-
form to the college’s pro-
posal,” said Bolinger.

‘When freshmen are ran-
domly assigned,’ he said,
“‘we will do our best to ac-
_comodate their interests. If
they want to go to another
house, we will do our best
to arrange a trade.

‘‘As a house we were gen-
erally opposed to the way
the college’s plan was  in-
Stituted.” Bolinger said he
believed that ‘“‘likes attract
likes and that those that
didn’t fit in would not want
to stay.

“Whether we call
selves a national or
fraternity, our main goal is
to have a committed group,
that is a group that is com-
mitted to each other. We
hope that we can retain this

Faculty members, stung
by the administration's fail-
ure to consult with them con-
cerning recent administra-
tive appointments, decided
in a recent meeting to with-
hold any definite action un-
til the return of College Pre-
sident Samuel R. Spen-
cer, Jrxjfrom Europe.

The meeting, held Tues-
day, Nov. 24, was called by
Dr. John M. Bevan, college
vice-president in charge of
academic affairs, in response
to a petition signed by «12-14
faculty members requesting
a meeting to discuss the
matter of major admini-
strative appointments.

This same petition had
been signed by more than
50 faculty members by. the
time of the afternoon meet-
ing.

According to a_ reliable
source on the faculty, mem-
bers of the faculty were up-
set over ‘‘the procedure by
which the administration has

feeling within the new (sy-
stem,” he said.

Beta Theta’ Pi decided
to accept the plan of the
college and remain in their
house, but they have not de-
cided whether they will re-
tain their national charter,
according to Beta Vice Pre-
sident Dick Allison.

“The question as to wheth-
er we will be able to keep
our charter will probably be
decided at the Beta nation
al convention this July.

“A delegate from this house
will raise this question at
that time,” said Allison.
“Whether, we remain a_ na-
tional fraternity is up to
the interpretation of this

convention.”

‘Allison did note however
that the’ Beta national pre;
sident has expressed his per-
sonal opihion that the met-
hod of selection defined by
the college is incompatible
with the constitution of the
general fraternity. .

“Most of the guys enjoy
eating down here,’’ said Al-
lison. “They felt that the
present. operations — of ~ the
house could — still function
Within the guidlines of the
college’s plan.” —

Kappa Alpha President
Robert Truitt refused to
comment on the decision of
his fraternity; however,
freshmen who arended: 1 KA

rush parties said they were
told that the KA’s plan ‘to
reject the plan of the col-
lege and move off campus.

Some freshmen were also
told that the KA’s already
had made a ‘‘verbal agree-
ment’’ on a ‘house.

Kappa Sigma voted to ac-
cept the college plan, re-
tain their charter, and re-
main in their house on cam-
pus, according to John
Harper, fraternity president.

“We decided to go along
with the college’s plan, be-
cause we. felt there was no
way out of. it,’ said Harper.

Informal Rus

Supported By Four Houses

the week will be determined

made’ recent appointments.
Personalities were not in-
volved in the question, just
procedure.”

It is college policy that the
administration should - con-
sult at ‘least with the ex-
cutive committee ofthe
faculty concerning major ad-
ministratrative appoint-
ments. According to sources,
however, the administration
has not done so in regard to
its recent appointments.

“There have been four ap-
pointments made in the past
term without consulting the
official instrument of the
faculty, the executive com-
mittee,’ a faculty source
said. ‘‘The faculty was not
consulted formally at all,
and we haven't even dis-

covered anyone that was
consulted informally.”
. Assumedly, the four ma-

jor appointments referred to
are those of Dr. Jay H. Ost-
welt as Vice President in
charge of instructional de-
velopment, Richard, C. Burts
as Registrar, William H.
Terry as Dean of Students,
and C. David Cornell as Vice
President in charge of fi-
nances.

The meeting, according. to
the faculty source, was well
attended by the faculty, and
“there was a good deal of
ventilation of thoughts.” Sev-
eral faculty members _re-
quested action ‘‘deploring”
the administration’s ap-
pointment procedure, while

a few others felt that Spen-:

cer should be ‘‘censured” for
failing to consult the faculty.

tomorrow when the freshmen
return their bid acceptances,
according to ‘uyman Parri-
gin, rush spokesman.

“At this time, however, I
think the freshmen were re-
sponsive to the fraternities’
position,’ said  Parrigin.
“Everybody at the other
houses were happy with the
number of people who
showed up and with the gen

eral atmosphere which pre- ©

‘vailed.”’

Phi Gamma Delta Presi-
dent and UHall ‘Counselor
Charlie Parks, however, dis-
agreed. ‘‘From what I've
seen, rush was a big flop, he
said. ‘‘From_ the {reaction
I've gotten from freshmen
and some upperclassmen in
the houses conducting rush,
I don't. believe it was as
successful as some _ people
claim.”

(Freshman Class President
Bill Ralston said he felt

most freshmen enjoyed rush.
“T think the freshmen liked
the opportunity to look at
each house and gain the
knowledge which they might
not have attained otherwise.
Many remarked to me how
each fraternity had a differ-

ent character and atmos-
phere,’ he said.
Ralston maintained how-

ever that most freshmen are~

not sure of what the new
social system will mean to
them, ‘iMany want to know
whether the college will in-
tervene to prevent swapping
during the random assign-
ment, period,” he said,

“Since many of the frater-
nities are not sure of what
they will do,"’ said Ralston
“many of the freshmen are
leary of accepting bids. I
do not think a majority of
the freshmen will in fact
accept them,”’

According to Parrigin the

long range purpose of the
rush was ‘‘to get ithe -trus-
tees to reconsider their de-
cision and allow a compro-
mise between non-selective
eating clubs and national
fraternities."’

“We feel that when pre
sented wilh tthe point of view
of four strong national fra-
ternities, they will reconsid-
er their previous decision
which was based on some
misinformation,’ he — sid.

In response ‘to this Dean of
Students Richard ©. Burts
Jr. said, ‘It is most unlike-
ly that the trustees will re-
consider their stand on fra-
ternities.

“Their decision was a firm
one, They have been consid-
ering the fraternity question
for a number of consecu-
tive. years. I don’t think
there is. a remote chance
that they will reconsider,’’
