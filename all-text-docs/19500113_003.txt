BETA THEZA PI

Well. after a nice, long, ‘restful
‘oliday, everybody is back with
the bright prospects of exams
ahead Things are not quite the
same chowever: there are two new
addvione to the Beta family. Con-
gratulations to Earl Groves and
his wife, Lucy, and Newt Robc.t-
son and his wife Betty, beth
brothers ‘turned family men. Con-
gtatulations are also in order to
Prother Cliff Turner, scholar and
gentleman, for his recent achieve-
ments in the fields of band direct-
ing and dog training.

The new year was ushered in in
an appropriate manner by a large
gathering of pledges and brothers
from Charlotte, Davidson, Reids-
ville, Burlington, Greensboro, and
Winston-Salem at Francis Pepper's
cabin near the Twin City, after a
finc ‘basketball game at Hanes. The
Betas present and their dates per-
formed the proper ceremonies at
twelve midnight, and some insisted
on aiding those farther west at the
stroke of twelve Central Standard
Time. Everyone thoroughly en-
joyed himself.

Young “Wooglin,” offspring of
a campus canine known as
“Blackie,” now has his eyes open
and is progressing satisfactocily,
although his father hasn’t been seen
locally for several weeks. We have
been particularly interested in this
pup because he arrived in this
world in Brother Gant Carlton’s
room. Gant reportedly acted as
mid-wife in the emergency,

We are proud of ovr boys who
are making such a good start on
Davidson’s young swimming team.
especially John Jervis and Ray
Cunningham, both first class breast-
strokers. The “whale” in his
natural habitat is a wonder to be-
hold. And, speaking of water, some
of. our more conservative brothers
and pledges are viewing with alarm
the actions. of Brother Roy Horn
and a certain young lady at Queens
College. Some fear that they are
eventually destined for water, both
hot and deep, much like that in
which are several other folks men-
tioned in this epistle.

Also in the proud-of department:
Libba McGee, beautiful member of
our family who was recently choser
Maid of Cotton. No one is prouder
than Bob Richardson, whose pin
she wears,

Repardless of appearances, Phi
AlpLae sons of Wooglin are grad-
ull centering their attentions on
* 1c ning festivities, as are most

‘idson students during this
ccucial oeriog, and are looking for-
‘ard to another good semester in
Beta Theta Pi at Davidson.

The pledges have decided to

at the Charlotte YWCA. Such
spirit is really admirable.

The chapter was privileged to
have the eminent Ox Garber as its

Another semester draws to a
close amid the usual last-minute
tush to get'in Aerm papers, paral-
lef reports, laét$minute reviews, and
to get ready for\the final exams.
Soon all of this rush will die down
and the usual “why do this work
today when I can put it off until
tomorrow” attitude will return as
always. Most of you ‘have prob-
ably made the New Year’s resolu-
tion that this will not happen to
you. When you get that clean slate
next semester, you intend to keep it
that way. Yes, you intend to make
a good record for yourself in the
New Year. Well, I hope that you
do.

Let’s hope that the Sigs keep
up their good record in basketball.
The basketball team has thus far
won three straight games. They
have beaten the Phi Delts, Kappa
Alphas, and the Campus Club, re-
spectively. The team has been Iced
on the floor by Dorsey Pleasants,
only starter that played on last
year’s team, Phil Blatt has come
through very. well in the center
slot. Paul Eastman, Bob Merrell
and Tyler. Berry round out the
fine quintet. For his height, Tyler
Berry gets an exceptional amount
of rebounds and. his defensive play
is sparkling. Keep up the good
work, Laverty, in coaching this
team to the top.

The fraternity will be guided this
next semester by Consul John
Kelton. He is ably backed by
Marshall Dendy, Bill Harris, Joe
Walker, Don Shriver, Paul Laver-
ty, and R. B. Covington. With the
100 per cent backing of the mem-
bers, these leaders can lead us
forward. ,

We congratulate the : following; some fine basketball for us. Talk-

for bringing glory to Sigma Chi
in the past year: Mott Price, Bill
Brooks, Bob Graham, John Kelton,
Dick Morgan and Don Shriver. We
hope that you all have just as suc-
cessful years in the future.
Congratulations to Rill Clark,
also, for his excellent leadership
as consul, Congratulations to Joe

the Christmas holidays.

for his class his last three -years.
Major Sample is a yiember of
the SPE. social fraternity.
Commenting on the changes at
Davidson since he was a student,
Major Sample said that the big
ehanget is in the number of build-
ings that are on the campus now.

Dake Dormitory, the Science
Building, the Library and, of
course, the new gym, were not

built then. .

In 1939, Major Sample began
his army career at Fort Moultrie,

the United States in. 1944. After
returning he attended the Infantry
School, and then he was instruc-
tor at this school until 1946. In

DR. E. O. GUERRANT

Davidson Professor

Publishes Book

“Roosevelt's Good Neighbor
Policy,” a book on U, S. relations
with Latin America between 1933
and 1945 written by Edward O.
Guerrant, associate professor of in-
ternational . relations at Davidson

College, will be published January
1

Dr. Guerrant, a political and re-
search analyst in the State De-
partment, records the day-by-day
developments which were guided
by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Cordelt
Hall and Sumner Wells.

The author, a graduate of David-
son in 1933, has been a faculty
member here since 1946. He re-
ceived the Ph. D. degree from the
University of Southern California.

Published by the University of
New Mexico Press, the new book
is described as an engrossing and
comprehensive report on U. S. Latin
American policy under Roosevelt.
It has already been selected for
use at the University of Southern
California.

‘| describe a general situation.

After matriculating, all MEN in
college must mature. Consequently,
in passing from the stage of em-
bryonic freshmanism te that sub-

lime level of aesthetic seniorism,

one must migrate through several
mellowing periods before one
reaches that. much desired state
of maturity. Let us then not be
so casually naieve as to overlook
that necessary evolutionizing trans-
it of the Christmas and New Year
vacations during our college ca-
reer. This ripening period has in
itself three different phases, but
involves as many minute mellow-
ing processes as a Lucky Strike.

Here, tet us observe that the
first of these three phases is that
of transportation home. Since to
describe transportation a la plane,
car or train, would miercly be
dawdling in the realm of fantasy,
t will digress to the particular by
using my own = experiences to
My
itinerary covered some 680 miles
(square-trip) and moving home-
ward covered in an uncovered jeep.

curvations, contourous causeways,

By refusing the holiday. spirits, I
confused even the total abstainers
in my household and to the amaze-

I instead injected intravenously

plasma; once more restoring idiocy.

The next fairly wniversal phase:

of spending the Christmas holidays
at home is that of spending the
Christmas holidays at home. Upon
reaching my abode I hastened to

‘and } checked the calendar for mail-

ing time to find out which easily
embarrassed and potential hanky,
sox or tie giving relative I would
send a card and yet have time for
them to become sufficiently em-
barassed to send me in return a
tie clasp, billfold or belt. Unhbe-
knownst to myself, I arrived just
in time to start and finish last
minute Christmas shopping, listen
to “Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Rein-
deer,” an infinite number of times
on the victrola, decorate the Christ-
mas tree (upon which I planted
the first untangled electric light
string on New Year's Five) and
enjoy several games of electric
football on my little brother's still-
hidden present from Santa. He, by
the way, later admitted that he
knew of it (the game) all along, but
for the sake of our. ego had effected
a gullible air of belief that we were
operating a still behind the closed
doors. ,

On Christmas morning, in spite
of Santa Claus, many in the re-
pose of The

As bowl games drew to a close
and the bicarbonate of soda was
placed on the shelf until the next
holidays, some inner calling
prompted myself (as other David-
sonians) to return to the salt
mines. Consequently, as I packed

In closing there remains, of

adage goes: speak softly, and carry
a big suitcate (plus a Greyhound
bus ticket), and you will go far. A
greyhound, incidentally, is the
fastest moving thing this side of
a pyramid or perhaps .a petrified
forest and makes as many stops
in rural holes and warrens as an
expectant rabbit (ess). As my time
grew short and IT thought once more
of my holidays and tried to mitigate
the idea of returning to school, J
frustratedly felt convinced that only
the sadistic rule of the P.T.A.
would impose such poetic justice
upon my weary soul.
