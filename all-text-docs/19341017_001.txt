Professor At Union Theological
Seminary Leads Y. M. C. A
Services Here

IS DAVIDSON ALUMNUS

Special Music _ Furnished By
College Glee Club

Dr. W. Taliaferro Thompson, Profes-
sor of Religious Education at Union
Theological Seminary in Righmond, Va.,
spoke at the Y. M. C. A. Vesper Service
last Sunday, ‘taking temptation as his
general subject.

The service, which was led by Bob Smith,
was attended by the largest vesper crowd
of the year. The musical part of the
program consisted of an organ prelude
by Prof. James C. Pfohl, hymns by the
entire audience, and a special number
rendered by the college glee club accom-
panied by Carleton Chapman at the organ
and Kenneth Scott at the piano, Don
Bailey led in prayer.

Dr, Thompson is a Davidson graduate,
having compiled an outstanding record
while in attendance here. After his
graduation he served in several pastorates
before taking his present position at
Union Seminary, His keen insight into
the problems of a young man has made
him a popular speaker with college stu-
dents.

Dr. Thompson took as_ his . text
Hebrews xii:4, “Ye have not yet resisted
unto blood, striving against sin.” “We
are all,” he said, “subject to temptation.
Even if we climb to a moral plane where
we lose our old temptations, we are sure
to find new ones.”

Temptation is a fight. The majority
of us withdraw from the fight before we
have drawn blood. We want to parley
with temptation. No man can reach the
heights unless his life is a challenge, not
a truce.
yield to a small sin just because every-
body is doing it and we think we can
That small sin will
not only lead on to greater sin, but will
undermine our whole moral structure
just as bleeding from a small vein will
weaken the whole body.

First we must define our temptations.
Every occupation, every time of life,
every individual has his own temptations.
Each man must search out his own, so
that he can meet them squarely. The
search must be honest; most people have
a tendency to try to cover up the black-
ness of their sins even to themselves.
“The first mark of maturity is the fac-
ing of the realities of life.”

“Having defined our temptations,” said
Dr. Thompson, “the next thing for us
to do is to try to avoid them.” He com-
pared men with kegs of powder. They
must stay away from any place where a
spark might fall on them and cause dis-
aster. We must.also avoid people who
might lead us into temptations which

might prove too strong for us.

~The fight is hard, but we must not
los€ courage. We can always get help
from the example of One who ‘was
tempted in all things like as we are, yet
without sin”. Dr. Thompson closed his
talk by illustrating this point with the
story of a corporal who was overcome
with fear just before going over the top.
An officer saw him and yanked him to
his feet, “Look at me,” commanded the
officer. The corporal looked, and drew
courage from his eyes. When the
moment came, the corporal followed his
officer over the top and was the first in
the enemy trenches,

Dr. Thompson led the audience in

prayer, end after the singing of a hymn
pronounced the benediction.

Hornbeck has been out of school since

Hornbeck was “fortunate not to be

CATS PLAN

Friday Pepmeeting To
Precede Duke Contest

There will ise a Seident Body pep-
meeting held in front of Chambers
immediately after supper Friday
night, in preparation for the Duke
game of Saturday.

This meetipg, which promises to
be the largest held so far this year,
will be under the direction of Var-
sity Cheerleader Paul Warren and
the recently elected Junior Cheer-
leaders, Joe Dees and eae Mc-
Leod.

The band will be share to assist
with the songs, and a_ speaker,
whose name will be announced
later, will give the pep-talk. A
shirt-tail parade around the campus
is planned to conclude the rally.

A Freshman pep-meeting was held

purpose of teaching the new men

and other similar meetings, the
cheerleaders are confident that the
cheering Saturday will be greatly
improved both in quantity and qual-
ity, and that the team will receive
much better support than in the
Elon game of some weeks ago.
