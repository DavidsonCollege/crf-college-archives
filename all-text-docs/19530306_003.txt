HIGH SCHOOLERS ARE FICKLE LADS

And therein lies the rub. High school football players
who suddenly find themselves the object of college coaches’
attentions have a most distressing habit of becoming, on that
provocation, as fickle as the proverbial lass in the springtime.
Wooed by glib gentlemen from all over their section of the
country — and often from all over the nation — these lads
frequently find themselves saying Yes when they mean Maybe,
and Maybe when they most likely mean No.

That Davidson College usually comes out on the short end
of this situation will be attested to by any coach who has ever
been associated with this school since the advent of Big
Money Football. You go to see a boy, tell him of the merits and
virtues of your school, and maybe he says yes, he'd like to go
to your school.

Then a few days later another man from a bigger college
walks up, begins speaking more in terms of the financial angle,
and blooie, there you are without the boy you had already
counted in the bag. :

The result is, around Davidson anyway, that no high
school athlete is considered bagged until he arrives for prac-
tice in the fall of his freshman year.

“You don’t know ’til September first,” said backfield
coach Tom Fetzer, just who you've got.” And just last year it
was that one of the best prospects Davidson had had lined up
for some time was enticed away by a better offer.

WHY COACHES GROW GRAY

He was a rugged, stocky boy from the North Carolina

piedmont, who had: been a good if not a flashy lineman in
high school. The Davidson recruiting staff had worked hard,
and as the summer drew toward a close he was planning to
come to Davidson.
. Then they played an all-star game within two weeks of
the opening of fall practice here, and the boy played a bril-
liant game. The result was that the scouts from the big univer-
sities besieged him, and pretty soon he was no longer plan-
ning to go to Davidson. Another offer from a bigger school was
so good that he couldn't afford to turn it down.

“He was a good boy,” says Dole, reflectively tipping back
his hat. “Would have been'a regular for us, probably. Instead,
he’s just one among a crowd of good ones.” With that, the
Davidson head coach breathed a sigh that seemed to say That
Is The Way The Ball Bounces.

What is obviously needed is some system to bind a boy to
his promise after he commits himself to come to one particular
school. We are certainly not advocating any such system as the
professional football leagues use whereby players are “draft-
ed” by the several pro teams after the college season is over.

The story-book rise to success by
a freshman basketball player,
whose real calling in high school
was down the football line, makes
the Wildcat story of the week.

Ray Harding came out for basket-
ball a somewhat reserved and
stocky guard. He showed up fairly
well, but was placed on the JV
Squad to “get some experience”.
He immediately took a first-string
job for “Fetzer’s Furies”, and. was
such..a hustler and had such a
good eye for the bucket that he
caught the eye of Coach Miller and
beJan dressing for the varsity
games after playing full-time for
the Kittens.

Ray Was Hustler

Ray was precocious when it came
to experience and began getting
into the varsity games oftener and
oftener. He showed a spark and

this week, was postponed until next
week because of bad weather and
the resulting poor condition of the
track

Even if Ward decides to head a
‘Davidson delegation to W. C. tomor-
row, the group wouldn't be up to
full strength. Bud Duncan is no
longer with us. ;

| Cobb, Alex Hodgin, and Larry Par- .

high schools sending the largest delegations.

The most formidable group entry
so far is the Camp Lejeune Marine
outfit. Last year the Marines put
up a stiff fight before bowing to
Appalachian State Teachers Col-
lege, which is not sending a delega-
tion this year.

Weick Competes Again

Former National AAU Champion
Bill. Weick, a graduate of Iowa
State Teachers College, appears the
man to beat in the tournament.
Weick, now in the Army, is sta-
tioned in Georgia and thus is eligi-
ble to compete in this region.

The Davidson entries are as fol-
lows:

Kerry Spiers and Bobby Joe Key,
114-pound class; Dick Webb and
Dave Jones, 125; Tommy Jordan,
Gene Craven, Charlie Murray, and
Hugh Neisler, 136; John Buxton,
Stan Topple, Scott Ball, and Don
Reid, 146.

Athletic Director P>ul Seot.. who

is expecting entries from the high
schools of Salisbury, Statesville,

The NAAU has adopted the Inter-
national rules for wrestling (Olym-
pic rules) for conducting its meets,
and these are the rules, with some
modifications, which will be used
in the Carolinas AAU Tournament.

Olympic Rules Used

The bouts will be of ten minutes
in length rather than 15, and an

Wildcat

acts as host. :

The Cats finished their regular
season’s play last weekend up at
Virginia Tech where they: were de-
‘cisively defeated to end.a winless
season. They participated in a
tough nine-mateh card.

Coach Cnarhe Parker “oux only
five entrants as he pulled out for
the Virginia city this morning.
Coach Parker’s tournament: squad
includes: Gene Craven at 137
‘pounds; Johnny Buxton at 147
pounds; Bill Coe at 157 pounds;
Nabbie Armfield at 167 pounds;
and Willie McElveen at 177 pounds.

Craven Top Prospect

The top Wildcat prospect is
Steady Gene Craven’ who returns
in this match to his normal 137
pound class. Gene has lost but
twice in the 147 pound class in
which he has been working all sea-
son. Now as he returns to the class
which is more in his range Coach
Parker expects great things of the
scrappy senior. ,

In an interview before the team
left this morning Coach Parker re-
vealed his high hopes for Gene.
Parker stated that since Craven
was runner-up in the 137 pound
class in the conference last season

entered with a poor season’s record
and pulled some big surprises
which had the big teams sitting up
and taking notice. Davidson grap-
pling fans are hoping for\a repeat
performance. :
Parker Praises Buxton

Another man to waten according
to Coach Parker is stocky Sopho-
more Johnny Buxton who wrestles
in the 147 pound class. Buxton hag
lost . ut one match in conference
competition this year. Johnny was
the only Cat winner in last week's
logs to VPI although Don Reid did
obtain a draw,

Buxton nas improvea a lot as the
Season progressed and is one of the
finest wrestlers in his class in the
conference and if he can keep up
his winning ways he will go far
in the tournament.

In the overall picture of the tour-
nament Maryland’s Terps loom as
the favorites as they boast one of
their finest teams in recent years.
Davidson didn’t go up against the
power packed Terps this year but
the Marylanders have beaten sever-
al of the teams which beat the
Cats. However, in a tournament of
this type comparative statistics

aren't worth much as the Cats
proved last year.
