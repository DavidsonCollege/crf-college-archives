-Political Science Class Conducts Drug Survey

By DAVID McGEE

Students in Political Science Profes-
sor Thomas Kazee’s Public Opinion
class have completed a survey of drug
use at Davidson and are now analyzing
the results. The class decided on the poll
when Dean of Students Will Terry
suggested to Kazee that his class conduct
a poll on drug use.

Terry had considered hiring an out-
side polling agency, but decided against
it because of the expense and the nega-
tive reaction he anticipated from stu-
dents. Kazee emphasized that the survey
reveals mostly student attitudes and be-
haviors toward drug use and does not
point to any policy recommendations
specifically.

Terry said he would be interested in
the poll mainly for its informative value
and doubted that the results would lead to
any policy changes or direct action by the
college.

The survey asked for demographic
information, student opinion, and the ex-
tent of the respondent’s use of alcohol
and illegal drugs. A total of 424 students
were surveyed, 268 male, 153 female.
The students selected for the poll were
chosen randomly from the student body
population. The survey’s standard error
is positive or negative 5 percent. The sur-
vey's level of confidence is 95 percent.
These two statistics mean that 95 out of

100 of the sample surveys would reflect
the true value of the population, if the en-
tire student body were surveyed. The
percentages below could vary by positive
or negative 5 percent from their stated
values.

For the purposes of the survey, the
term “drugs” referred to a number of con-
trolled substances, but did not include al-
cohol, caffeine, asprin, or similar “over
the counter” medications.

The following statements are taken
from the survey. Respondents were
asked if they strongly agreed, agreed, did
not know, disagreed, or strongly disag-
reed with the given statement.

350 Of 609 To Attend Davidson As Class Of 1988

By RAND HARTSELL

The Class of 1988 will be filled by
next Monday. according to Dean of Ad-
missions John Griffith. Of the 609 ac-
cepted applicants. 172 men and 132
women have confirmed that they will at-
tend Davidson next year. Griffith ex-
pects next year’s freshman class will
have about 350 members.

These figures are lower than the
target sizes for men and women, Griffith
said. He explained that it will be neces-
sary to “go to the waiting list in order to
bring the number up to.our intended sizes
gf 210 men and 140 women.”

While these numbers are comparable
to last year’s figures on applicants, ac-
ceptances, and enrollments, Griffith
pointed out that there is a nation-wide de-
cline in the number of college applicants.
“By the end if this decade,” he said,
“there will be 25 percent fewer graduat-
ing high school 17 and 18 year olds than
in 1979.” Griffith also said in the North-
east there will be 40 percent fewer
graduating high school 17 and 18 year
olds.

Recently, Liberal Arts colleges have
been unable to attract as many students
as, for example, engineering and com-
puter science oriented schools, Griffith
said. Because of the higher male versus
female attraction toward engineering and
computer science programs, the female
section of next year’s freshman class has
been easier to fill than the male Section.

_ Griffith added that the Admissions
Office has observed a gradual change to-
wards “qverlapping” with other schools.

Ten years ago, the average Davidson
applicant applied to other schools such as
UNC-Chapel Hill, Duke, Wake Forest,
Washington and Lee, Vanderbilt and the
University of the South. Now the change
has been to overlap with UNC, Wake,
and Duke still; but schools such as
Dartmouth and Williams. have replaced
the more southeast regional schools.
Griffith said this shift reflects David-
son's change in perception and associa-
tion with the traditionally prominent
schools. It also reflects a recruitment of
southern students by northern institu-

tions, Griffith said.

Applicants from areas outside the
south have enjoyed an increased accep-
tance rate, Griffith said, pointing to an
increased. level of the quality of those
applicants, Statistics on the total number
of minorities and other breakdowns in-
cluding SAT scores and geography are*
not compiled yet, but Griffith sees very
little change in these respects compared
to last year's class. “I do have an impres-
sion of a more diverse class with regards
to non-black minorities with an increased
number of Hispanics and Orientals. But.

I don't have that information available
yet.” he said.

“We are very excited about this
year’s class. There are some marvelous
kids in it.” he said. Griffith pointed out
two future students, one who manages
his own business. which makes enough
to support his family. Another is a dancer
who has performed with a leading U.S.
ballet company. “This class also shows ,
an extensive amount of international tra-
vel,” Griffith said, “[which is] indicative
of an appreciation for international inter-
dependence.”

Latin American Policy Group Organized

By ALLISON WILLS

A new organization, Latin American
Policy Alternatives (LAPA), is studying
issues related to Central America and
proposing alternatives to the Reagan Ad-
ministration’s Central American poli-
cies. .

Students became interested when
Economics professor Jason Thompson
spoke on U.S. aid to Central America in
late April.“They wanted to start a group
to express our views and to. see what we
could do at Davidson,” Thompson said.
He believes that Central American issues
are the most important issues related to
the U.S. anywhere and, he said “the
likelihood of war there is very great.”

“Reagan’s notion is that this area rep-
resents a conflict between the U.S. and
the Communist world, but the position of.
LAPA. is that the problem is not East/

West but a problem of inequality,”
Thompson said. “People are starving and
we should have the first priority of feed-
ing them before we supply arms. I think
one of our positions will be to stop arms
to Central America.

“We don’t want to just be negative:
that’s why we want_to offer something
constructive and formulate alternatives
to the Reagan Administration’s poli-
cies,” Thompson said.

This group is a branch of the Central
American Awareness Committee. The
CAAC serves soley as an educational
forum with no political bias, but
Thompson's group separated for the pur-
pose of making “progressive statement.”

Twenty-five students and professors
signed up for the group, which has held
three meetings so far. The group met
Tuesday to discuss the elections in El
Salvador. :

_ “Our number one priority is food.
shelter, and clothing for the people of
Latin America,” Thompson said. “Other
concems are access to political justice
and économic opportunity .~
