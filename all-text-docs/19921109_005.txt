in a way that challenges the U.S.
[and] challehgesmany other major
powers,” said LaFeber.
Gorbachev admitted, as-
serted LaFeber, that the Soviet
Union fell behind the other major
world powers technologically and
militarily, thus leading to corrup-
tion in their system. LaFeber be-
lieves the years from 1945 to 1990
were actually an “aberration of his-
tory” because technology wascon-
tained within the political outlines
of the two-camp world. There-
fore, the Cold War era was more
predictable and secure. Since the
end of the Cold War, technology
began to diffuse among nations
and we are “back to the historical
world of the late nineteenth, early
twentieth century,” said LaFeber.
LaFeber discussed a theory
created by Margaret Thatcher as a
possible explanation for this new
balance of power ina world he sees
as very similar to the year 1914, a
“much less predictable and much
more dangerous world.” LaFeber
described Thatcher’s theory as a
“three block world” centered
around the German Deutschmark,

the United States’ dollar, and the’

Japanese yen. These blocks of
economic power would be a chal-
lenge to, Clinton because foreign
diplomacy would be entirely dif-
ferent from anything ever experi-
enced by the post-World War II
generation.

In terms of German economic
power, LaFeber said that three or
four years ag6 nobolly Could have
imagined the progress of today’s

unified Germany, especially the
Deutschbank, which handles
twenty to twenty-two percent of
German trade. Western Europe is
becoming the world’s strongest
economy and LaFeber says if this
economic block “comes to fruition
[it] would be the largest block in
the world.” LaFeber said the United
States is very closely tied with
Germany and that credit for the
success of German _re-unification
should be given to Bush. The
French and the British appealed to
the Soviet Union to prevent the
German reunification, yet Bush
tookcharge and persuaded Mikhail
Gorbachev to slowly remove So-
viet troops from East Germany,
explained LaFeber. Despite these
close ties to the United States,
LaFeber cited the German’ srecent
deals with Japanese firms as an
attempt by the European Commu-
nity and Japanese technology and
capital to “target the United States
as an economic competitor,” espe-
cially the aircraft industry. There-
fore, despite these ties between the
United States and Germany,
Clinton will be presented withchal-
lengesto American industries from
Europe and Asia as he tries to
solidify economic agreements. in
his own hemisphere.

The United States’ economic
block centers around the North
American Free Trade Agreement,
according to LaFeber. This agree-
ment worked so well between the
United States and Canada that the
removal of tariffs originally slated
for 1999 has been accelerated to
1994-1995. Yet, even more im-
portant, says LaFeber, is the his-
toric decision made by the *presi-
dent of Mexico in 1989 and 1990

to sign a free trade agreement with
the United States. According to
LaFeber, the Mexicans have been
suspicious of U.S. capital ever since
the loss of the Texas territory.
LaFeber also believes Clinton will
be tougher on the Mexicans before
he signs the agreement into law.
Reservations first raised by Sena-
tor Lloyd Bentsen about Mexico
have been adopted by the Clinton
camp, says LaFeber.-These reser-
vations include Mexico’s inad-
equate protection of the environ-
ment and the insufficient amount
of money allotted for the retrain-
ing of U.S. workers who will be
put out of work by the agreement.
LaFeber believes Clinton will prob-
ably make adjustments to the treaty,
yet the new president will be open
to ratifying this kind of agreement.
Although this block is “not quite
there yet,” LaFeber believes it will
be established by 1995-1996.
The Japanese block is based
on bilateral agreements with sev-
eral Asian countries in which
American capital still plays a large
role. Unlike the U.S. and Ger-
many, it is “not a political, multi-
lateral treaty framework in which
the Japanese are moving,” says
LaFeber. The Japanese are quietly
setting up an export market while
most of the attention is directed at
the European Community and the
United States. According to
LaFeber, the Japanese have been
successful in exploiting markets in
Thailand and Malaysia and they
are prepared to move into Vietnam
when its markets open.
WhatLaFeber finds extremely
interesting is the possibility of an
economicrelationship between thie
Japanese and the Chinese. LaFeber

says despite the Japanese
dependance on the U.S., these re-
lations with China would be too
important to the Japanese to allow
U.S. involvement. The U.S. cur-
rently has more investment in
China than the Japanese and,
LaFeber said, “ the U.S. histori-
cally has cared a great deal about
China. . . There’s now going to be
a race for the Chinese market.”
Clinton could affect this race for
the Chinese market by removing
their “most favored nation” status
as a warning that he will not toler-
ate the Chinese abuses of human
rights. LaFeber says Clinton’s
policy toward China will be “well
worth watching because it will be
an indicator about where he is
headed in foreign policy.”
LaFeber admitted that there
are problems with this concept ofa
“three block world” since it ex-
cludes some of the most volatile
nations from these “stable block”
regions and there are very strong
nationalisms within some of these
blocks. The volatile regions in-
clude Africa, the Middle East, Latin
America, and parts of South Asia,
not to mention the Soviet Union.
There is a remaining Japanese
dependance on American military
presence in Asia since they are
afraid of the nuclear situation in
the fragmented Soviet Union and

are willing to pay an inordinate
amount of money for U.S. military
troops to remain there, said
LaFeber. i

The problem of nationalism is
also evident within the Asian block
as other Asian countries continue
to desire American military pres-
ence since they have not entirely
forgotten what the Japanese did to
them in the 1930s and 1940s, said
LaFeber. Despite these fears, the
United States has already pulled
forces outof the Phillippines and is
slowly reducing the number of
troops in Guam.

AsLaFeberdemonstrated with
his comparisons to the year 1914,
Clinton’s United States will be very
different from the America of his
lifetime in terms of foreign rela-
tions. The Cold War is over and
there is no longer a great ideal to
pursue since “liberal capitalism and
liberal democracy have won,” yet
LaFeber wonders what the next
generation will do without the pre-
dictability of the Cold War.

Interestingly, LaFeber’s final
statement about the current world
situation’ was a quote from a Rus-
sian journalist who said, “People
cannot jump out of their skins and
nations can’t jump out of their his-
