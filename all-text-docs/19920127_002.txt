Asian Calendar Seeks

To Break Beauty Stereotypes
SAN FRANCISCO (CPS) - A
professor at San Francisco State
University, creator of the Asian
Pacific Islander Men Calendar,
charges that conventional stan-
dards of beauty ingrained in
American society often exclude
ethnic diversity.

’ Antonio DeCasto says that
Asian males are often stereotypi-
cally portrayed in the media as
wimpy gecks, evil villains or
dominating husbands. The cal-
endar, he notes, reaffirms the’
Asian male’s physical attractive-
ness and sexuality. es

The 1991 calendar, termed
political beefcake,” by The Se-
attle Times, has caught the atten-
tion of the media throughout the

Angeles Times and een hick

NCAA Approves More Academic Reforms

ANAHEIM, Calif. (CPS) -- Aca-
demic eligibility standards for
freshman athletes will be even
tougher beginning in 1995. The
change is one of many approved
by the National Collegiate Ath-
letic Association at its 1992 annual
convention.

The new academic requirement
involves increasing an incoming
student athlete’s minimum grade
point average to 2.5 in 13 core
curriculum courses and establish-
ing a sliding scale that balances a
student’s standardized test scores
with his or her grade average.

For example, the scale would
allow an athlete with a 2.0 to
compete if he or she scored a
minimum of 900 on the SAT or 21
on the ACT. If the student has less
thana 2.0 grade pointor scores less
than 700 on the SAT or 17 on the
ACT, he or she would not be eli-
gible to play sports.

Previously, Proposition 48
stated that athletes must have a
minimum 700 on the SAT or 18 on
the ACT withaminimum 2.0 grade
pointin 11 corecurriculum courses.
No sliding scale existed.

Coaches of the Big East Con-
ference had the most vocal opposi-
tion to the new rule, primarily
because of a continued complaint
against using standardized test

scores as an eligibility cut-off
device.

The NCAA President’s Com-
mission drafted the newly approved
academic package.

“About six years ago when
propositions 48 and 42 were ap-
proved, it was the beginning of
academic reform (in the NCAA),”
says Rick Ervard, director of legis-
lative services at the NCAA. “This
is just a continuation.”

Other propositions approved
at the NCAA convention include:
--Allowing student athletes to re-
quest information about their po-
tential in the professional sports
market without losing eligibility -
- as long as the student does not
retain an agent.

The proposal was designed to
help students deal with the busi-
ness aspect of becoming a profes-
sional athlete by allowing them to
seek “job advice” like other stu-
dents.

Student athletes, however,
cannotenter the NBA or NFL draft
and retain eligibility. The Pacific-
10 Conference opposed the propo-
sition, fearing hat institutions might
be held liable if an athlete says he
or she received bad advice from
his or her university.

--Allowing coaches of major sports
powerhouses to continue collect-

new Ukrainian government will treat the nuclear issue with utmost
caution, due to the ever present memories of Chernobyl.

Krawciw added that the weight of the nuclear issue demands a
timely Western alliance with Russia and the Ukraine. In light of the
international cooperation proven effective during the Gulf War, Krawciw
is optimistic that an alliance can indeed be formed.

General Krawciw will have a chance to personally influence reforms

* in the Ukraine when he leaves this Spring for a conference in Geneva to

begin discussing strategic options for the new Ukrainian military. The
Ukrainian army, he said, felt the split from the Soviet Union much more
powerfully than did the Ukrainian citizens and faces a great challenge in

redefining its military purpose.

Krawciw, along with twenty-four chosen assistants, will play a
major role in redirecting the Ukrainian forces. The military has already
received over $500 million from the Swiss government for its strategic
campaign. General Krawciw hopes toraise another million dollars in the
United States before he leaves for Geneva.

--Giving Division I basketball
teams more leeway for playing in
exhibition games the Thanksgiv-
ing holiday.

The NCAA voted against a
measure to create a new football
division, Division I-AAA, for
smaller Division schools. And,
the full NCAA membership agreed
to. officially oppose a - federal
mandate written into the pending
Higher Education Reauthorization
Act that requires the public disclo-
sure of athletics-related revenue
and expenditures at schools.

Atthe close of the convention,
most said they were satisfied with
the outcome.

“The 1992 NCAA convention

_has proved to be one of the most

significant in recent memory,”
Creed Black, of the Knight Foun-
dation Commission on Intercolle-
giate Athletics, said in a prepared
commitment of university presi-
dents and athletic administrators
to the integrity of intercollegiate
sports and to the academic well-
being of the student-athlete.”
