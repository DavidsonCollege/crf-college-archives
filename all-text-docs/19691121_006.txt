outside familiar patterns will
need to recognize the divers-
ity of ‘talents and motiva-
tion among both students

and faculty.

Further, our experience
with area exams _ should
make us aware of the real
difficulties in any innova
tion for a new program to
be successful, it must be
clearly understood by every-
one who is to be involved.

As the program is develop-
ed. there needs to be a con-
scious effort to create sup-
port for it. Both students and
faculty must be persuaded
that. the ‘effort required is
worthwhile or failure will .a-
gain result.

Area exams were destroy-
ed by an absence &f clear
purpose and by a lack of
support from those involved.
Eventually, as pressures
bullf up, this lack of support
turned to hostifity.

It seemed best to make a
clean break betwen the un-
successful .area exams and
any new program.

More careful planning: will

avoid some of the specifie
problems and misunderstand-
ings which plagued area
exams.

A new start will allow us to
break away more completely
from traditional patterns And
construct a program specifi-
cally designed to meet a new
educational purpose.

But a well-constructed pro-
gram will not automatically
be successful. Learning is a
voluntary process. Students
and faculty can be guided
to effective learning by good
programs, but no one can
be coerced to learn or teach
by any program.

The essential ingredients
are understanding, and sup-
port from those involved,

We now realize more clear-
ly than before just how
strongly new programs are
resisted. But we still need a
Program designed to guide
and encourage learning be-
yond our familiar classroom
routines.

To meet this need, despite

the obstacles, we must con-
sciously sell that program
to both students and faculty
or it will not succeed.

Another difficulty in ob-
taining good concert groups,
according to College Union
Director C, Shaw Smith, is
that concerts are relegated
to weekends because that is
the only time girls come
here.

“There are much better bar-

gains during the week,
Smith added, concluding that
if the campus goes co-ed this
problem ‘will lessen. But he
emphasized that weekday
concerts will have to be co-
ordinated with the college's
academic schedule.

thereby be free to leave the

3. The development of the
honors college may well have
been jeopardized by this fac

Adding about 400 enroll
ments to the course load in
the third term is going to
make it difficult to free cer
tain faculty members for
work in the proposed honors

departments to allow faculty

More courses must be of-

faculty members must re-

these courses. Indeed, addi-

On a national level, Trax-

The Conference also pub-

These groups, said Trax-
