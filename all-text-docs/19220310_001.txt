Queens Girls Entertain

With “The Twig of Thorn”

Class in Expression Win the Hearts
of Good House.

One of the most successful and delight-
ful entertainments given here this year
was a play given by
from Queens College, on the evening of
Friday, March 4th. This drama, entitled
“The Twig of Thorn,” is an Irish play,
of which it has been said, “No one can
touch, ever so lightly, the old traditions
cf Ireland, without falling under the
spell of their magic.” The cast were
members of the class of expression at
Queens.

This Irish fairy play was rendered
much to the satisfaction of everyone
present, portraying clearly some of the
customs, superstitions, dress and vogue
of a certain class of Irish people.

The story of the play is one of old
Irish romance, in which Oonah, the
heroine, leaves Dublin to live with her
grandmother, among peasant folk. There
she becomes implicated with a “twig of
thorn” and an attractive fairy, but
through the services of Aileel, the poet
and Aengus Arann, her lover, all turns
out well. The cast of players was as
follows: .

Ooonah—Miss Meme Hampton.

The
Long.
The

Grandmother — Miss Kathleen
Lover—Miss Elizabeth Finley.

The-Poet—Miss Katherine Shuford.

The Priest—Miss Ruby Cain.

A Fairy Child—Miss Virginia Abbott.

Neighbors—Misses' Howard, Crater,
Norman, Morrison, Henderson, Powell
and Silverstein. Misses King, Stone, and
Brasington were the teachers in the
party. The guitar playing of Miss Lois
Rogers, behind the scenes, was a fea-
ture of the event, as was the accompany-
ing of Miss Brasington.

One very noticeable feature of the
play was the ease and clear enunciation
of thé players, not a word being lost to
the hearers.

The giving of the play here was made

|ton and J. C. Bailey, with W. A. Gamble

as alternate and manager, were selected

citizen: “Resolved, That the Federal
Government should own and operate the
coal mines of the United States.”

to be held at Queens College, in Char-
lette, on April 7th. Davidson will uphold

S. A. Taylor, and FE. E, Houghton,

J. P. Price, W. M. Cox, D. B. Walthall,
and Rolston Bitzer. All of these men had
strong arguments and their debates were
well worked up.

crs that several ballots were necessarily
taken before the judges could reach a
decision.

What Will Your Future Be?

Here on World Outlook

Editor of The Independent to Visit
Davidson, March 17th.

On March 17th students and friends of
Davidson are to be given a real treat in
the form of a lecture on “America and
the World Outlook.” This lecture is to
be delivered by Hamilton Holt, present
consulting editor of The Independent
and Weekly Review, and a man of in-
ternational reputation.

Pat Crawford (Capt).

Captain Pat Crawford, right guard,
leader of the best quint that ever sported
the Red and Black on the hardwood
playground, is the state’s premier sugar-
coated star guard, Playing every moment
of every game, this bundle of concen-
trated T. N. T.-proved to be the most
veluable player in the state. In spite
of the fact that he played guard, he
tossed the leather agate for 46 ringers
while the opposing forwards could gath-
cr but 33. Pat is a hard worker, and
although his play is at times a bit rough,
it is clean.

George Mauze, Center
Coach Hengeveld has developed “Ole

| West Virginia,” into a. player whose
|great work has attracted the calcium
He was the mainspring of the
| Poison Squad’s scoring outfit, causing
|the ball to enter the realms of the meshes
|for 130 points. However, Warhoss was
most valuable to. the team floor
man. He was a veritable whirlwind on
the hardwood and the plays that didn’t
sport his initials were few and far be-
tween.
A. C. Ormond, Left Forward
Ormond also did his share in carrying
the hod for the Wildcats this season, to-
taling 86 counters and playing a snappy
floor game. This is his first year on the
team and although rather shy of pound-
age, he is one of the most difficult men
in the state to guard. No matter where
the ball might be, he was right after it,
and once in it usually
took a trip to the net.
J. P. Price, Left Guard
Junebug was the big reason why the
Gpposing teams made so few points this
season. He played a great game on
sentry duty and many times repelled
strong attacks on the Davidson goal.
This India rubber guard not only played
a high class defensive game but at times

‘Randolph - Macon Beaten
By Davidson | Debaters

Miller and McKeithen Secure Four
to One Decision in Raleigh.

|

A team composed of P. D. Miller and
Harold MeKeithan, with D. H. Ogden as
alternate, won for Davidson the debate
l with Randolph-Macon, at Raleigh, by a
of four to The debate
took place in the auditorium of Peace
Institute, on the evening of Mareh od.
The subject was:

decision one.

“Resolved, That Con-
gress should provide for a Department
of Edueation under secretary who
shall have those duties and powers set

a

ferth in the Smith-Towner Bill.’ Da-
vidson defended the negative.
For Davidson, P, D. Miller was the

first speaker. He showed the evils of
state control of education and the need
of improvement in educational organiza-
tion, He also pointed out that our whole
educational system is inefficient, ranking
us below many other nations in regard
Finally he showed that we
must search for a remedy for this bad
condition of educational affairs.

ing.

J. H. MeWKeithan, dealing specifically
with the Smith-Towner Bill showed
how it would remedy the present needs
of education today. He also pointed out
in detail, the evils which the bill would
remedy. As in last year’s debate with
Randolph-Macon, Harold was especially
strong on the rebuttal, utterly destroy-
ing his opponent's main points.

The Randolph-Macon team was com-
posed of Messsrs. Michael and Black-
The alternate freshman,
George Hamilton, who has been a well
known high school debater. Michael,
the first speaker, pointed out in a logi-
cal manner that the bill is not workable
and would lead to political control of
educational affairs. His colleague, an
experienced speaker of oratorical abil-
ity, based his main argument the
fact that this expense of a hundred mil-
lion dollars entailed in the bill would
necessarily raise our tariff. This
the point upon which Davidson based her
rebuttal, and utterly defeated this point.

The judges of the debate were Messrs.
