WEEKLY MEETINGS

Due to the fact that the Woodrow
Wilson Day speeches were to have been
veld last Saturday night, the Literary|w
Societies postponed the regular debate
until Monday morning, doing away
with the regular Monday morning exer-
cises.

Jn the Eumenean Society, the ques
tion: “Resolved, That the President of
the United States should be elected: for
a term of six years and be ineligible for
re-election,” was upheld on the affirma-
tive by Brown, Carwile,  Huneyeutt
and) Morton, and oa the negative by
Cousar, McCloy, Bennett and Craig.

‘he decision, both of the house and
judges, were in favor of the negative.

In the Philanthropic Society, Peters,
Maddrey, Calhoun and Carriker upheld

the affirmative and Siske, Williamson
and Dawkins argued for the negative.
The judges decided in favor of — the

affirmative and the house in favor of the
negative.

The points brought out by the affirnt
ative were, that with the present sys-
tem of the first four years, the President
takes about one year to get familiar
with his work and the most of the last
two years is spent in putting himself be-
fore the minds of the people in’ prepa-
ration for re-election; that one four-
year term is too short, but if the Pres-
ident had_ six years of uninterrupted
work he could put thru all his plans of
government wisely and fearlessly. And
that the present system sets no limit up-
on the number of times.

The negative contended that ‘one term
of six years would not be a wise plan,
because should we get an unscrupulous
President in office, realizing that he
would not have to account to the people
i another election, he would rule as
he saw fit, impeachment being the only
method for getting him out of office;
that past experience has proven the pres-
ent system 1 success, and that, asa rule,
the best presidents are re- -clected, and,
in that case, eight years would be better
than six.

BOOKLOVERS’ CLUB MEETS.

The regular meeting of the Book-
lovers’ Club was held last Friday with
Miss Mamie Withers. ‘lhe study of
the life of Tolstoi was continued with a
very interesting article by Mrs. W. R.
Grey, who had charge of the program.
Mrs. Grey's subject was “Why Is Tol-
stoi Famous?” Her discussion was in-
teresting and enjoyed by those present.
About fifteen members of the club were
in attendance at this meetine of the
club. The next meeting will be held
next Friday at the home of Mise Maude
Vinson.

CHARLOTTE H. 8. 12-12

In what is thought to have been one,
of the best games played in Charlotte
since the opening of the gridirun sea-
son, the Scrubs played the strong C. H.
S. team a tie game last Saturday, the
score being 12-12.

The Highs began the scoring with a
touchdown ty Captain Wilson in the
first quarter. Pharr failed to kick goal.

the third quarter, rushing the Highs’
off their feet and scoring after a min-
ute’s play. Davidson’s kick-off went
over the linz, and was brought out to
the 20-yard line. Pharr’s attempt to
punt netted only 10 yards. A series of
line plunges and end runs brought the
ball to Highs’ 20-yard line, and Mc-
Alister carried the ball over for a
touchdown. Failing to kick ‘goal, the
score stood 6 to 6. Davidson then cam
hack with a mighty rush and it looked
as if another touchdown was inevitable
but when they had the ball on the 25-
yard line Templeton intercepted a_for-

ward pass and ran go yards for a touch-
down, Pharr failed to kick goal.

During the last quarter the Red and
Black carried the ball 35 yards down
the field to the 19-yard line, where Sin-
gleton carried the ball over for David
son's second touchdown, Failing to kick
goal, the score stood 12-12. “Phe whis-
