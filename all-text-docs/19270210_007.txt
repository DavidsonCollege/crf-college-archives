Thomas Jonathan Jackson, known to read-

Jackson, and hero of many battles in the War
Between the States, Was indirectly connected
with Davidson College, and if tradition is
considered, he was directly connected with
the Presbyterian institution.
historically correct.

The former js

His indirect connection with the college
was through his second marriage with Miss
Mary -Anna Morrison, whose father was
Rev. R. H. Morrison, D.D., first president
of Davidson College, which received its in-
ception in 1837. Mrs. Jackson published a
history of the life of her husband many years
ago, and this is the source of the authentic
information.

In speaking of the life of her father in
its relationship to Davidson, Mrs. Jackson
says that he, “Rev. Dr. R. H. Morrison, a
Presbyterian minister, had in his earlier days
been a pastor in towns, and was the first
president of Davidson College, in North
Carolina,” followed by the statement that
Dr. Morrison had been a graduate of the
University of North Carolina in 1818 “in a
class with President Polk, Bishop Green of
Mississippi, and several other men of emi
nence in the church and state.”

Before Mrs. Jackson wrote her history, her
pastor had paid a tribute to her father and
to Davidson, with questions asked in regard
to the future of the institution. Her pastor
wrote, “Davidson College, of which he was
founder, has risen to eminence among the in-
stitutions of America. Its high standard
commands the respect of the whole country,
whilst the moral influences which govern
and surround it are unsurpassed. During the
52 years of its existence, it has given to the
church 200 ministers of the gospel!
is, able to measure its influence

for good
through all coming time?

And who is able
to estimate the indebtedness of society, the
state and the church to its noble founder ?
Davidson College is his monument, for which

generations yet unborn will rise up and bless |

the name of Dr. Robert Hall Morrison.”
When “Stonewall” Jackson married Miss
Morrison, the latter’s father “could not trust
his emotional nature enough to marry any of
his daughters,” said Mrs. Jackson in her ‘his-
tory, and so the ceremony “was performed
by a favorite old ministerial friend of mine,
Rey. Dr. Drury Lacy,” on July 16, 1857. Dr.
Drury Lacy, was the president of Davidson
College, being the third one to occupy this
position, though Mrs. Jackson did not men-
tion that fact in her history. Dr. Lacy was
president of Davidson from 1855 to 1860.
Dr. Drury Lacy is the father of the pres-

ent state treasurer of North Carolina, and |

grandfather of Dr. Ben R. Lacy, a graduate
of Davidson in 1906, and now president of
Union Theological Seminary at Richmond,
Va. Mrs. Jackson’s history reveals the fact
that during the War Between the States that
Dr, Drury Lacy was chaplain and was a
constant companion of her husband. This
recalls the service of Dr. Ben Lacy, who
served in the same capacity during the recent
World War, 56 years later. The latter's
work was known to the entire American Ex-
peditionary Force, and his valiant work was
similar in many respects to that of
grandfather.

Tradition tells us that “Stonewall’’ Jackson
was a professor of Davidson College for
three weeks, but verification of this is lack-
ing at the present time.

The story is told that he. was visiting D. H.
Hill (later Gen. D. H. Hill), who was pro-
fessor of mathematics at Davidson at that
time. General Hill and “Stonewall Jackson
married sisters, and it is believed that the in-
cident occurred during their “courting” days.
While Jackson was visiting Mr. Hill, the
latter is said to have become ill. Desiring
that his classes.continue without interruption,
he induced “Stonewall’’ Jackson to take his
position as professor of mathematics until
his recovery. Mr. Hill's illness lasted three
weeks,

Since Mr. Jackson was a graduate of
West Point and later a professor at Virginia
Military Institute, his preparation for the
task was admirable, and this belief can be
easily comprehended. History also tells us
that Mr. Jackson at one time applied for the
chair of mathematics at the University of
Virginia, which cerifies the fact that he was

FOOTBALL PRACTICE
More than 80 men have answered the call
issued by Coach Tex. Tilson for spring’ foot

ball practice which started on the 31st of
January.

Each man is fighting hard for a
place on the squad, which is soon to be cut |
down to\60 men, |

Practice is expected to last until the end |
lof March. This will give two months of |
intensive training. For the first three weeks
only the fundamentals of the game will be
taken up and no plays will be run. Later
real scrimmage will start and the squad will
be divided into the Reds and Blacks. Fach
side wil be taught a number of plays and,
as heretofore, several games will be played
between the Reds and the Blacks.

The men have already been divided into
jtwo big squads. Those making the
| showing were placed in “A” squad and the
| rest in “B” squad,

the second meeting which will be Wednes-
day night, February 16. As Dr. Noble is
quite well known among the students as
a man well informed along the lines of
his chosen profession, he will be heard
with great interest. i
J. M. Appleby and J. C. Barnhardt, who |
have charge of this work, have announc-
ed that other men who have shown dis-
tinct prominence in their professions will
speak to the remaining
groups and are hoping that those men |
who have not decided upon their life work
will take advantage of this splendid op-
portunity while they may.
