College Hostel Can House
Student Dates Cheaply

At last a program has
been instituted on the David-
son campus whereby a girl.
friend or date can inexpen
sively stay while visiting.

The Davidson College Hos-
tel, located in the basement
of the Guest House runs on
the honor system. The girl
first is requested to sign her
name and address and_indi-
cate the length of her stay
on the register.

After depositing a dollar
solely for linen. the only ex-
pense incurred, she _ then
makes her bed and at the
end of her visit puts the
dirty bedclothes in a laundry
hamper. Each package of
linen is an additional dollar.

The hostei has room for 30
accomodations distributed over
four separate rooms, the most
crowded of which sleeps 14 in
seven bunk beds. There is one
bathroom having twin showers.
Such system requires little

prehensive fee.

At the urging of students the
administration has agreed to
break down the comprehensive
fee according to categories to
let students know what their
money is being spent for.

The student senate wants a
distinction made between resi-
dent and non-resident students.
and the administration agreed
to look into this and other
points. Further meetings are to
be held, and it is hoped that
exemptions and guidelines for
the comprehensive fee will be
discussed.

During the two hour meeting
both sides maintained there

small amount of supervision.

The dollar fee is collected
by Scotty Nicholls. Student
Housing Director, and is used
to cover the laundry costs for
clean linen and for the general
upkeep of the hostel.

“The idea is to keep the pro-
gram simple.’ said Dean of
Students, Will H. Terry. ‘If it
seems to work, we can always
add to it, putting in more bunk
beds.”’

College Students To Decide
On Resumption Of Free U.

By BILL GIDUZ
Staff Writer

The formerly successful Dav-
idson College Free University
has not resumed operation so
far this year, and prospects for
its resumation are dim at this
time.

The Free U. still has a bank
account of $420.00 and two co-
directors, seniors Kurt Geisin-
ger and Jack Scott, but the two
are not optimistic about the
future of the organization.

It was started in the fall of
1968 by a student, Rich Cowart
and the Free U. operated for
two terms each year until now,
with courses being taught by
regular faculty and student
alike.

Courses that were offered in
the Free U. included family
planning, auto mechanics,
sculpture, personal finance and
Christian-Marxist dialogue.

Geisinger noted that the Free
U. complemented the regular
college curriculum, and in no
way tried to compete with it.

Geisinger and Scott now feel
that the Free U. may have serv-
ed its purpose. According to
Scott, there were originally
three purposes of the Free U.,
“to offer courses on campus
that one could not get in the
regular curriculum, to offer
adult education, and to offer
education for the high school
students in the area who want-
cd to take courses over here.”

Both feel that those three
purposes are no longer valid.
Some of the Free U. courses
such as astronomy and para-
psychology are now offered in
the regular Davidson curri-
culum, while the Extended
Studies program allows the stu-
dent to follow up any other sub-

ject that he might be interest-
ed in.

A review of attendance show-
ed that a comparatively low
number of adults attended the
class sessions, and finally, the
college is now thinking about a
program involving local high
school students.

Geisinger outlined some oth-
er reasons for the demise of
the Free U. ‘‘For it to be suc-
cessful, you've got to have the
Queens girls coming out .
but the Queens girls come out
for the first two or three times,
and. then if they don’t like the
class, they stop coming. It’s a
long way to come.”

The same proved true for
Davdison students, and ‘‘peo-
ple just don't do the work if
they aren't getting a grade, it’s
really hard to keep the interest
up.”

Geisinger continued by lam-
enting the fact that there was
outside work in the Free U.,
but said that the 1% hour per
week class schedule made the
work necessary if anything was
to be accomplished.

The $420.00 budget this year
was obtained from appropria-
tions from the student senate
and the student activities fund.
Geisinger and Scott stressed
that the money would be re-
turned to the donors if it is
decided to disband the Free U.

That decision will be made
on the basis of the results of a
poll to be distributed to all
students during the winter term.
The final decision will subsequ-

ently be made before the end
of the winter term.

However, Scott emphasized
that he and Geisinger are not
trying to dump the project.
“We're perfectly willing to help
people get it started again if
they feel like it’s worth their
time.”

Therefore, the fate of the Free
U., which was conceived for the
students, is up to the students,
and will depend on their inter-
est in that method of education.

Davidson To Fast
To Help Refugees

One of the greatest human

- tragedies of modern times is

occurring at this very moment
in India where nine million re-
fugees from _ crises-torn East
Pakistan are starving. To help
remedy this terrible situation,
every high school and college
in the nation will have the op-
portunity to participate in The
November 3 Fast to Save a
People, jointly sponsored by
Oxfam-America and Project Re-
lief.

The college Peace Coalition
is sponsoring the fast at David-
son. Students are asked to ab-
stain from eating for one day
and use the money saved to help
the refugees in India. A drop
box for contributions will be
located in the Union on Nov. 3
so that all Davidson students
will be able to help a starving
people who desperately need
the concern of others.
