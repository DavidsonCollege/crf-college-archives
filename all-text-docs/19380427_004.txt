The Relays are to be held
Friday and Saturday and will at-
tract, as always, a brilliant col-
legiate field. A feature of the
meet is to be a special mile run
between Cunningham and Ven
zke, famous distance rivals.

The former football captain is
conceded a good chance to win
the discus throw. His official toss
of 146 feet against Virginia last
Saturday is only 2 feet 2 inches
short of the throw that won the
Relays last year. The husky field
star tossed the disc 148 feet 10
inches on a later try against
Virginia, but fouled by stepping
out of the ring. The repetition
of such a toss should win the
