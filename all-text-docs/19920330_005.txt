Bricks: Building Davidson College From 1835 to 1929

There are bricks all over this
campus,

Notall of themare in the build-
ings or walkways, either. There is
a long history of construction and
reconstruction at Davidson, and
today the remnants rest all around
us.

The first bricks at Davidson
were made on Major John
Caldwell’s plantation during the

summer of 1835. The contract:

stated that 250,000 would be de-
livered. Eight buildings in all were
put up, three being dorms, two
houses for faculty, asteward’s hall
(for the more or less Dean of Stu-
dents), and the obligatory Presby-
terian chapel. Today, only Oak
and Elm dormitories still Stand,
but the west foundation wall of
Steward’s Hall, demolished in
1909, can be seen today next to the
Guest House. All were standing
by spring 1836, and two more
dorms were built in front of the
President’s home the next year.
Don’t think any of this was
glamourous. A. woman from
Chapel Hill commented as late as
1871 that “a very singular want of
taste is the most striking feature in
the buildings and grounds... Eve-
rything looks jumbled and dingy.”
The President’s home, now quite a
mansion in its own right, then
measured 18 feet by 18 feet, and
faced what we knowas Main Street,
which then was nothing but a
muddy strip. The other faculty

home, called Tammany, stood until -

1901 between Elm and Phi Hall,
which came in 1849 along with
Eumenean Hall. The chapel was
located right where Cunningham
is today, and like the other struc-
tures, had aroofoftin. Remodeled
as Shearer Hallin 1901, it was torn
down in 1960.

Two buildings stood across the
street from the college. First, the
Helper Hotel wentup in 1848 as an
inn for travelers. The college did
notacquire it until 1946. The Grey
House, now the office of College
Relations, was constructed in 1850
as a home and a store by the Hen-
derson family. Although it could
never be proved, the Trustees
always suspected that alcohol was
sold to students in that old house,
violating the college charter ban-
ning the sale of alcoholic bever-
ages for a two mile radius around
campus. By 1859 the building
became faculty housing, putting to
rest the accusations.

Only one more structure went
up before the Civil War, and that
was the great Chambers Building,
built between 1857 and 1860. All
of the brick was made on campus
from local clay. Atthe time Cham-
bers was the greatest collegiate
building in all America, and still
today is well know as amonument
anda landmark. One architectural
historian in 1944 called it “one of
the stateliest college buildings in
the South, if not the entire nation.”
Amazingly, plans called foraneven
larger structure eventually, with
the wingsexpanding out, rearward,
and around to form a huge court-
yard with a garden and a laundry,
and containing five hundred dorm
rooms. Already the two dorms in

front of the President’s house had
been disassembled, but plans ap-
parently would have called for the
destruction of every other building
on campus except for the old
chapel. Perhaps fortunately the
Civil War wiped outany ideas they
had right along with the entire
college endowment, Yet with all
the grandiose talk, Chambers had
no inside toilets until 1910, and
students instead relied on outhouses
behind it.

After the War a large semi-
circular drive was spread out in
frontof Chambers, following basi-
cally what is the paved road in
front of New Chambers today.
Then, though, it was unpaved and
formed a giant “D”, and was called
that until the middle of this cen-
tury. Along this curve, right be-
tween the old chapel and Cham-
bers and facing west, Morrison Hall
was erected in 1890. The upstairs
went to the YMCA, and the first
floor was used as a gym. At the
other end of the drive, standing
where Cunningham Church
(DCPC) is today, was the curious
first DCPC church building. Some
described it as an “eyesore” in later
years, and no one could argue that
it certainly looked very different
from everything else on campus.
Attempts to describe the odd little
structure would be in vain, so it
must suffice to say it hardly fit the
stately old campus.

A rash of construction came

with aie new,century,.with. t

dorms going up in ten years. The 4

original Martin Chemical Labora-
tory had been built from 1899. until
1901, placed roughly where Dana
and the Grey Union are now.
Rumple in 1903, on the site of our
Little, Watts in 1906, and Georgia
in 1909, placed in front of toady’s
Belk, all made up the Dormitory
Row. The Camegie Library, now
the Guest House, went up in 1910
with the demolition of the old
Stewards Hall. Interestingly, the
new building was built with pieces
of the old, just as Shearer had been
made out of the old’ chapel and
Tammany Hall. Shearer was not
attractive, though, as it was oddly

_stuccoed over the traditional brick.

The student body had grown
from 147 in 1902 to 336 in 1911-
12. Great plans were-drawn up in

‘1915 fora great campusrevitaliza-

tion, pushing the amazing growth
of Davidson to new heights.
Alumni Gym was built directly
behind Chambers behind the site
of Little Library in 1917, and plans
called for it with four other build-
ings including two lecture halls, a
YMCA/Social building, and a
“Physical Laboratory” to form a
quadrangle behind Chambers. Two
dorms were to be built east of
Georgia. These were the only struc-
tures of the plan to be realized, as
they were about to be sorely needed.
A fire destroyed Old Cham-
bers on the fateful day of Novem-
ber 28, 1921. With it went a quar-
ter of the college dorm rooms, the
library and museum collection, but
thankfully no lives. Responding
quickly, two more wood barracks
(adding-to the two put up in 1920)
were thrown up as a temporary

measure (although they remained
until 1945) and the construction of
East, renamed Cannon in 1957,
and West Dorm, renamed Sentelle
in 1971, promptly ensued. Luck
would have it that Watts burned in
1923, and subsequently had to be
rebuilt on the same site.

The old walls of Chambers
were torn down and the old brick
sold off in 1922. In 1924, the
granite foundations came up and
were used in several locations. The
retaining wall that runs along the
campus side of Main Street.inear
Cunningham uses much of that
granite. And, if you keep your
eyes open, you’ll notice similar
chunks of rock outside of New
Chambers and other structures
around campus. The great col-
umns of Old Chambers remained
up until the new buildifig was
almostcompleted in 1929, and then
they were razed. The 900 Room in

the Grey Union has some dramatic
pictures of the event on the far
wall.

With the addition of New
Chambers, Davidson College lit-
erally was recast, quite fulfilling
the predictions of many, including
the Charlotte Observer: “Davidson
College has been doing business in
a building that long since became

inadequate to the demands of a,

modern institution... The Observer
is anticipating nothing short of a
reconstructed Davidson...” And
so it was. With the new hub,
Davidson began a sharp transfor-
mation over the next forty years to
become a formidable campus and
institution, making moves and
constructions bigger, though cer-
tainly no more bold, than the
changes of the last eighty years.
Strangely, though, with all of
the change, we never escape the
past. Walk through the campus

and you’ ll notice reminders like a
strange strip of brick just under the
gravel path by Elm Row, the odd
granite wall next to the Guest
House, piles of brick near the Post
Office, the retaining wall on Main
Street, the patches of discolored
grass in frontof Chambers, and the
bits of broken brick strewn about
Eu and Phi Halls. There are bricks
all over this campus.
