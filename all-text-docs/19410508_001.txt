’ TAYLOR SPEAKS

Dr. H. Kerr Taylor, executive
secretary of the Presbyterian
Committee of Foreign Missions,
brought a message of thanks to
the Davidson student body for
their Christmas. gift to Foreign
Missions in a talk to the students
in chapel Tuesday.

It was explained that
Snell, who was to be sent
China with the money, has been
unable to get to: the Orient, be-
cause the State Department has
refused to grant passport.
However, the money will be put
‘to good use in mission
work.

’41 Year Book
Is Completed

Staff Hopes to Issue Annual
2On May 20.

Editor-in-Chief Winston Taylor,
and Business Manager Gene Ve-

reen announced this week that the

last picture for the “Quips and
Cranks” of 1941 went to the en-
gravers on Wednesday, April 30th,

and all the copy has been com-
pleted and sent to press.

Because of the larger advertise-
ment section this year’s annual will
be a few days late in leaving the
press. However, the editors have
promised us an interesting issue.

This year’s “Quips and Cranks”
will consist of many new advertis-
ing features and ideas, and for the
first time since the 1938 year book,
there will be a pictorial advertise-
ment section.

More time and work have
put on the ad section than on any
other part of the book, and it con-
of practical

been

sists of a great number
ideas.

In an interview with the
it was learned that the new annual
will contain many informal shots of
campus life, and this year feature
pictures will be its drawing card.

Editor

Although it would not be “cric-
ket” to tell yet of the new cover
design, a rumor, more substantial
than the usual Davidson one, has it
that the cover will be one of unique
design. E

One of the most important parts
of the annual, and possibly the most
important part to some few is the
beauty section. This year the per-
sonnel of the beauty section has
been chosen by an outstanding con-
noisseur, who incidentally is a mem-
ber of the faculty.

The annual staff expects to issue
this. year’s Quips and Cranks on
Tuesday, May 20th.
