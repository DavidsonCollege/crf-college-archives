Mark Byrnes: knowing students as people too

By ELIZABETH BLACKBURN
Staff Writer

“The students in my classes
are more than just a name on a blue
book. I know
who: they are
as people as
well as stu-
dents,” says
Davidson’s
new History
Professor
Mark Byrnes.

The atmosphere of Davidson
came as no surprise to Byrnes after
attending an undergraduate school
very similar in size.

After college, Byrnes departed

fromthe comforts of a small school
setting and attended University of
-Texas at Austin, where he found
himself in a lecture hall with 500
other students.

Byrnes taught at a local com-
munity college in 1989 while he
attended graduate school and has
been teaching continuously since
the spring of 1993.

Last year, Byrnes taught at
Dickenson College in Pennsylva-
nia. He will be teaching at Davidson
for the Fall and Spring Semesters
while Professor Ralph Levering is
on sabbatical.

Byrnes is currently teaching
U.S History since 1877 and U.S.
Foreign Policy since WWil.

Byrnes has harbored a strong
interest in history since he was
young.

His parents instilled in him a
deep sense of history through ac-
tivities such as trips to the histori-
cal sights of his country.

“T have loved history all
through grade school, high school,
and college — teaching seemed to.
be the natural progression of that
love,” Byrnes says.

After Davidson, Byrnes hopes
to continue teaching ata place simi-
lar in size and atmosphere.

He says, “Davidson has a nice
collegial atmosphere, where the
faculty and students are very
friendly. Davidson is ideal.”

Students visit AIDS quilt in D.C.

By JONATHON WILLIAMS

During Fall Break, 26
Davidson students traveled to
Washington, D.C., to volunteer at

mthe | Names

Student Project AIDS
GOoeams Memorial
Quilt. Led by

Sherry Malushizky, Georgia
Ringle, and Catherine Turner,
Davidson’s students added to the
force of 10,000 volunteers from
around the country.

Our duties as volunteers var-
ied greatly. While some of us guided
visitors to specific quilts of loved
ones, others kept watch over as-
signed areas to insure that those
grieving could do so undisturbed.
Other volunteers worked the pub-
lic information tents or souvenir
sales areas. Each morning during
our stay, we assisted 1,200 volun-
teers in ceremonially unfolding the
Quilt, made of 1,920 panels. Each
night, the entire 45 tons of fabric
were refolded and stored.

The Davidson student volun-
teers also participated in the candle-
light march that began at the Capi-
tol Building and ended at the Lin-
coln Memorial. At the end of this
march, supporters of the Quilt gath-

ered to hear many note-worthy
speakers, including Elizabeth Tay-
lor, discuss the future of AIDS in
America.

In October of 1987, a group of
90 volunteers unveiled the first
showing of the AIDS Memorial
Quilt. Although 40 of the original
90 Names Project volunteers have
since died of AIDS, hundreds have
risen in their places to educate the
uninformed, comfort the sick, and
demand an effective, compassion-
ate response from people and gov-
ernment.

Presently, the Quilt represents
only about one in ten AIDS deaths
in the country, as it did that first
day in 1987. The quilt we saw over
Fall Break — all 40,000 panels of
it — covered the entire National
Mall. Quilts, sewn together to cre-
ate 24’ x 24’ squares of fabric,
created a grid that stretched from
the steps of the U.S. Capitol Build-
ing to the base of the Washington
Monument.

Parts of the Quilt visited
Davidson in 1994 and -were dis-
played in Johnston Gym.

Bakers give gift for Life Sciences Building —

from page 1

continue to place a severe strain on
existing facilities that barely meet
contemporary safety standards. To
continue to attract students of the
highest caliber, the College must
offer facilities that match the qual-
ity of teaching and research already
on campus.

The Watson Life Sciences
Building, named for Carolyn
Watson and her husband, the late
Wayne M. Watson of Atlanta, Geor-
gia, will be constructed directly in
front of the Dana building; an es-
planade will join the two struc-
tures. The new 32,000-square foot
building will house the departments
of biology and psychology in a
configuration conducive to labora-
tory-based instruction and interde-
partmental cooperation. The Bak-
ers’ gift brings the total fund-rais-
ing for the $12 million project to

$8.5 million in gifts and pledges.

. With nearly $6 million already in

hand, there is a total of $3.5 million
remaining.

Although not a Davidson
alum, Dr. Lenox Baker, Sr., served
the Wildcats football program as
team physician for several seasons
while his older son, Robert, at-
tended Davidson in the late 1950s.

Before his death last year, Dr.
James Watt, ’31, Frances Baker’s
father, had served Davidson’s
Medical Humanities concentration
for several years by participating
in the Healthcare Professionals-
In-Residence Program as a fea-
tured lecturer and mentor.

The Baker and Watt families
have a long association with
Davidson College, stretching back
to 1897 when Frances Baker’s
grandfather was a freshman in the
Class of 1901.

Since then, the two families
have produced 20 Davidson gradu-

ates and 15 doctors, representing
nearly four generations of Wildcat
physicians in each family.

The Drs. Baker have contin-
ued the family tradition and are the
parents of Margaret Watt Baker, a
graduate in the Class of 1995 and
the most recent member of the
Baker-Watt families to graduate
from Davidson.

In addition to Margaret, the
Bakers have three other daughters,
Sarah Flowers, Carol Lenox, and
Katherine Dial Baker.

In announcing their gift, Dr.
Kuykendall described the Bakers’
generosity as “overwhelming. The
entire Davidson College family is
rejoicing over this wonderful gift .
Their: well-respected standing in
the medical community and their
leadership in this Life Sciences
Campaign will provide the impe-
tus we need just now to complete
the fund-raising for this most wor-
thy—and necessary—project.”
