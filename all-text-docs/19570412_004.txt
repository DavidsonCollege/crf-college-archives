Wide campus confusion has
resulted in the past from the
dual authority of faculty and
student council in interpreting

and enforcing the college

The Student Council has the

‘This is no eulogy for a past

Mr. Jim Batten who has prob-

Those men who worked with
Jim on the Davidsonian staff

They learned to appreciate his

grew in their tasks through his
suggestions and compliments

Dr. Thomas H. McDill

Our guest speaker at Vespers
this Sunday will be the Rev-

McDill is a native of Arkan-

He received his Bachelor of | °

any ever seen at Davidson or

We think his Baker Scholarship

A LEADER

Early in ‘53 Jim decided to
put on shoes and join the Da-
vidsonian Staff. He’s been a
leader there ever since.

As a Freshman he began as
a reporter. became Managing
Editor as a Junior, and took
over the reins as Editor in the
spring of 1956.

Jim’s biggest fight as Editor
was for a change in Davidson
degree requirements . . . .stu-
dent opinion won the day. He
also lost, at times..... the cur-
riculum remains antiquated,
but when he lost it was with a
cool head, and not without a
hard fight. He initiated many

“A man who is on the Board

only 7%.

“No opinion,” 19%. -

The biggest surprise came
from the response to tht third
section of the questionnaire.
“In general, what political,
economic, and religious philos-
ophy do you desire that he (the
president) hold?”

The missing 6% either did

not choose to answer or altered
the question in such a manner

that the result could not be|f

As to the final: question,
“Who is your personal choice
for President?”, one out of
every three people had their
own candidate for the position.

Dr. Frontis. Johnston of Da-
vidson led the list receiving a
heavy margin over the other
names mentioned. Dean Rusk
(Davidson Rhodes Scholar and
President of the Rockefeller
Foundation), and Rev. Joha R.
Redhead (of Greensboro, N. C.)
completed the trio which were
suggested by nearly 85% of
those having a choice.

Among the others mentioned
were: Rev. Warner L. Hall,
Rev. Fred R. Stair, Rev. James

CREATE PLEDGE
To enforce the drinking rule,
a pledge was designed in which
fraternity presidents must wit-
ness that they saw no drink-
ing or its effects at any cam-
pus activity.
Faculty, administration,
student council met to formul-
ate the new policy.
The council stated that it
did not wish to take on off-
campus responsibility and fa-

Mrs. Little has been at Da-

Mrs. Little gave the reason
for her resignation in saying,

INot Clear To Students

vored a generalization of the
fraternity presidents’ responsi-
bility on campus during dance
weekends in order that the stu-
dent government preserve its
own responsibility.

Consequently, two pledges
were drafted and are presently
in effect, one concerning cam-
pus activity, the other having
to do with informal fraternity
parties away from the college.
Each was to be signed by the
three top-ranking officers of
the fraternity.

FIRST PLEDGE

The former statement  af-
firmed the officer’s attendance
at “the dances and other cam-
pus activities of the dance
weekend” and that. “all the
above activities were conducted
in accordance with the stan-
dards of the college.”

The latter pledge affirms
that the three officers were wit-
ness to the fact that “the party
was conducted in a manner ac-
ceptable to the standards of
gentlemanly conduct.”

A poll of representative fra-
ternty presidents revealed vary-
ing reactions with one basic
thought, that the college had
made a definite advancement
in practicality through easing
the problem of divided loyal-
ties. ,.

one from the point of view of
the college and should be ac-
ceptable to most students who
