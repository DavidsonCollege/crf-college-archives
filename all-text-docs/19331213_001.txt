WIDESPREAD INTEREST

Popular Radio Artist Engaged by
Sophomores

With their annual week-end only
two days off, the Sophomore class of
Davidson College is making plans for
one of the largest and best sophomore
house parties ever given. A commit-
tee, consisting of representatives from
the ten social fraternities and of sev-
eral non-fraternity men, is planning to
provide a week-end that will do credit
to the class of 1936. Tommy Tucker,
Columbia Broadcasting artist, has been
secured from the Music Corporation
of America to play for this week-end.
This orchestra recently played from
the Hollywood Restaurant in’ New
York City.

Sophomore week-end will start Fri-
day night, December 15, with a formal
dance at the Charlotte Armory. This
affair will start promptly at ten and
will continue until two o’clock. A fea-
ture of the dance will be the fraternity
medley. Several no-breaks will also
feature,

The committee has made arrange-
ments to decorate the Armory, and
extensive plans have been made to
give the huge building a festive atmos-
phere.

On Saturday afternoon, Tommy
Tucker will again play at the Char-
lotte Armory. There will be no form
of entertainment on the campus given
by the sophomores, but the tea dance
in Charlotte will attract many students.
This affair will begin at four o'clock
Saturday afternoon. and .will continue
until seven that night.

“Saturday night, the sophomores will

_again sponsor another dance, featured
by several no-breaks and songs of the
different social fraternities. Miss Clif-
ford, who does the torch singing, will
render several. blues numbers at each
dance. ;

In last Sunday’s “ Charlotte Observ-
er” there were pictures of five girls
who will sponsor the sophomore af-
fair. The sponsors are: Misses Alice
Cowles Barringer, Charlotte; Dosty
Blackmon, Rock Hill, S. C.; Mary Gil-
lespie, Atlanta, Ga.; Rose Rogers,
Greensboro, and Eve Stevenson, of

Miss Louise Nelson will present a pro-
gram in chapel Monday, December 18,
at the request of the Music Depart-
ment of Davidson College. Miss Pfohl
will play several numbers on the harp,

of the harp will be demonstrated.

Both artists, are at present members
of the faculty of the School of Music

largest harp classes in the world at
the Unviersity of Michigan. In addi-
tion to that, she. is librarian of the
University’s School of Music, and is

the cataloguing of music. Miss—Nel-
son, her accompanist, received her
master’s degree from the University of
Michigan and has studied extensively
abroad.

They have both appeared with sev-
eral of the country’s leading orches-
tras. Only recently, Miss Pfohl re-
ceived, great praise for her rendition
of the harp solo of the Ravel “Sep-
tette,” one of the most difficult selec-
tions for this instrument.

Miss Pfohl is a sister of Professor
J.C. Pfohl, head of the Music Depart-
ment here.

Pi Kappa Alpha Pays Honor
To Retiring Grand Councilor

Local Chapter Presents Gift to
Dr. Arbuckle

Through its Beta Chapter, at David-
son College, the Pi Kappa Alpha fra-
ternity paid honor to Dr. Howard Bell
Arbuckle, retiring Grand Councilor of
the fraternity, in a ceremony held at
the Pi Kappa Alpha house last Thurs-
day evening.

The nature of the honor given Dr.
Arbuckle was a gift from the fraternity
to its “grand old man,” who had re-
tired this year from the presiding of-
fice of the national fraternity after
twenty years of active service. The
gift, a silver tray, pitcher, and goblets,
was presented by George M. Ivey, of
Charlotte, former District Princeps,
and an alumnus of Alpha-Alpha Chap-
ter at Duke.

The ceremony took place at a reg-
ular weekly meeting of the fraternity,
and was attended by the local chap-
ter, prominent alumni from nearby

To Be Held Sunday

Program for Vespers Will Be En-
tirely Musical

The annual Christmas vesper service
will be held Sunday in Chambers Au-

year, and has been well attended by
both students and townspeople. The

several scriptural between
hymns.

Three well-known artists have been
secured to take part on the program.
They are: Ruth Whittington Pfohl

Albert Blumenthal, violin. The Glee
Club, the Orchestra, and the Concert

rated with pine and cedar branches.

The Concert Band will gather in the
faculty room before the service and
play the chorales: “Morning Star,”
“O Cheering. Light” by Hagen, “Hark,
The Herald Angels Sing,” by Men-
dessohn, “ Angels, From the Realms of

Y Gift Fund Campaign
To Be Concluded Today

The campaign for the Christmas
Gift Fund has been in progress now
for the last two nights, and closes
with solicitations this evening. As was
announced in last week’s Davidsonian,
the fund this year goes to the Davidson
Unity Church, Splendid talks by Dr.
H. B. Arbuckle and the two student
workers, Don Brandon and Sidney
Marsh, have brought to the attention
of the students the need existing in the
community served by this church.

Sam Wiley, Y. M. C. A. secretary,
expressed the purpose and ideal of the
drive when he said, “If the Christmas
Fund is to be a real expression of the
spirit of giving, it should be contrib-
uted to by all the members of the stu-
dent body.” In order to keep the stu-
dents posted on the percentage of in-
dividuals contributing, statistic “ther-
mometers” for each of the dormitories
have been placed in the entrance to
Chambers Building, showing the prog-
ress day by day.

The goal has been decreased from
$1,000.00 to $750.00 in view of the eco-
nomic situation of today. However, it
is the unanimous contributing of the
students, rather than the sum reached,
that will mark the success or failure
of the campaign.

The money will be used to give
Christmas joy and baskets of nourish-
ing food to the sixty-nine families in
the neighborhood; to provide medical
attention where it has been sorely
needed; to make repairs in the church
building; to replace the dilapidated
benches that are serving there now,
and to provide a heating system for
the showerbath house constructed last
summer. Also, a “sinking fund” will
be established for future emergency.

Honored by Group

Dr. Howard B. Arbuckle, head of

the Chemist Depart was
presented with a gift here Thurs-
day night for faithful service as
Grand Councilor of Pi Kappa
Alpha social fraternity.

The North. Carolina State Symphony
Orchestra, under. the direction of La-
mar Stringfield, noted youthful com-
and Pulitzer Prize winner,
gave a concert in Charlotte, N. C., last
Thursday night. The orchestra also

poser a

gave coréerts in Winston-Salem’ and

Raleigh, N. C., on following nights.

A well-balanced and interesting pro-
gram was offered by the orchestra.
The first selection was a Mozart over-
ture. Then came Dvorak’s’ “New
World Symphony” which brought out
the music of the classes of people in
the “New World” as written upon his
return from a trip to the States. The
climax of the program was the ren-
dition of “Fhe tkegend of John Henry.”
The audience was interested particu
larly in this piece as it was written by
the conductor himself. Peter Tschai-

Dr. Lambeth Urges
Training of Minds
To PhiBeta Kappa

Gamma of Phi Beta Kappa Cele-
brates Tenth Anniversary
December 6

SIX PLEDGES INITIATED

Large Audience Enjoys Former
North Carolinian’s Address

“The purpose of education is not
the furnishing of the mind with a store
of facts, but the training of that mind
to think and by thinking to arrive at
a proper conclusion,” said Dr. W. A.
Lambeth, of High Point, in his ad-
dress before a group attending the
Phi Beta Kappa initiations at David-
son College last Wednesday night.

“The prodigy is of little value to
the world or to himself, and the same
can be said of the mental gymnast who
can do great feats of memory or per-
form other mental stunts. The mind
of a really educated man is the mind
that is able to think straight through
a problem until this just conclusion is
reached, a mind that is tolerant, that
avoids too great individualism, that is
not sectional in its affections, that is
able to live and act in co-operation
with its fellows.”

Dr. C. M. Richards, president of the
local chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, in-
troduced the speaker, who in the
course of his scholarly and entertain-
ing address brought out many inter-
esting points in defining the educated
mind.

Dr. Lambeth has recently assumed
the pastorate of the Wesley Methodist
Church in High Point, being removed
there from the Second Street Meth-
odist Church in Asheville. He has,

lege, now Duke University, served
many outstanding churches in this con-
ference, and was for a while pastor
to a large congregation in Washington,
D. C. He has established a very re-
markable reputation throughout the
Methodist Church as a minister, ora-
tor and student.

Before the address, at which the new
initiates were introduced to the audi-
ence, six members of the Davidson
Senior class and seven alumni, who
were members of the old Mimir So-
ciety, which préceded Phi Beta Kappa
on the Davidson campus, were taken

Prof. Edwin King Lectures
On Italian Renaissance Art

Young Princeton Lecturer Analyzes Florentine School in Series of
Illustrated Lectures..Monday and Tuesday Nights

A series of important educational
lectures on the subject of “Italian
Art” were presented in Chambers Au-
ditorium Monday and Tuesday by
Prof. Edward S. King, of Princeton
University. Professor King has made
an exhaustive study of this topic and
is considered an authority on renais-
sance art of the Italian school. All
three of the lectures were beautifully
illustrated by the use of lantern slides,
which greatly vivified the talks.

The speaker, who was introduced by
Dr. C. R. Harding, of the Davidson
Greek Department,’ spoke Monday
evening on “Florentine Art of the Fif-
teenth and _ Sixteenth Centuries,’
choosing this period for great
artistic richness, and this particular
school because, he stated, it represents
sixty per cent of the great art of the
period. In his lecture Tuesday night
Professor King spoke of architecture
primarily. Lantern slides depicted the
various architectural
they were described and explained by
the lecturer, A talk in chapel Tuesday
morning was utilized as a connecting
link between the two lectures.

Declaring that the Gothic works of
Italy are rivalled only by the Classic
studies in Greece, the Princeton lec-
turer described at length the features
and types of the former. The two
main features, he stated, in the Gothic
period were a striking realism, and a
highly symbolic view of the world and
its characters. A transcendental atti-
tude is manifest among Gothic artists
and their works.

Prominent among the fifteenth and

its

masterpieces as

sixteenth century artists which were

discussed by Professor King
Masaccio, Ghiberti, Botticelli, Fra An-
gelico, Piero Francesco, Da _ Vinci,
Raphael, and Michelangelo. Paintings,
statuary groups, cathedral groups, por-
traits, and other artistic manifestations
these Italian masters were de-
scribed, explained, and criticized,

Two bronze doors of Ghiberti, each
of which required twenty years of in-
tensive work to complete, were de-
scribed by the speaker as “ decorative
and graceful religious scenes,” display-
ing the scientific attitude of Florentine
art. The later master, Michelangelo,
described the famous second set of
bronze doors by Ghiberti as fit to be
called the “Gates of Paradise.”

In “The Tribune Money,” the great-
ness of the Florentine artist has pro-
duced, through a creative imagination,
a masterpiece from a seemingly insig-
nificant theme. This is typical of nu-
merous works of the period, according
to Professor King,

In concise fashion, Leonardo Da
Vinci’s “Madonna of the _ Rock,”
“Mona Lisa,” and “The Last Supper”
were criticized by the speaker; so also

were:

by

were the “Sistine Madonna” of Ra-
phael, the “Sistine Chapel,” “Last
Judgment, and “Medici Tombs” of

Michelangelo, and other less important
artistic creations of the period.

Professor King, who has taught at
Princeton University and at Bryn
Mawr College, is at present at Prince-
ton accumulating material for a thesis
on certain aspects of American archi-
tecture.

Hood Attends College
And High School Meet

Dr. Frazer Hood, professor of psy-
chology in Davidson College, has re-
cently returned from the thirty-eighth
annual meeting of the Southern As-
sociation of Colleges and Secondary
Schools held in Nashville, Tenn., on
December 4-8, 1933. Dr. Hood repre-
sented Davidson in the absence of Dr.
J. M. McConnell,

This association, which is composed

representatives from most of the
colleges and high schools in the. South,
had as its objective At this meeting a
closer relationship between secondary
schools and colleges.

One report. given at the meeting
brought out some very interesting sta=
tistics. The percentage of high school
graduates that go on to college is
greater in Mississippi than in any other
state represented in the association.
Also the percentage of failures of stu-
dents from Mississippi is least. These
statistics were compiled for all of the
Southern States, North Carolina being
near the top in all departments.
