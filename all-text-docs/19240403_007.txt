TAILORED AT FASHION FARK |

There’s Always a Better Way of Doing Things

This progressive age con-
stantly discovers a _ better
way of doing things—always
im’p ro ve s — develops
processes that excell.

Turole is pliant—has easy,
comfortable lines—conforms
to the wearer’s action or in-
action—is thoroughly dis-
tinguished.

Our tailors at Fashion Park,
for instance, have developed
the Turole tailoring treat-
ment—a method of making
“soft” clothing possessing
all the fine lines that well
groomed men demand.

The Turole tailoring treat-
ment is available in a series
of interesting style develop-
ments—we’re making a spe-
cial exhibit of them now.
