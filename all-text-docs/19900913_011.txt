spend more money on athletics
they deserve all the money, and
have lobbied to eliminate the auto-
matic bids. The winner of the Big
South now will play the winner of
the Southwest Athletic Conference
(SWAC) for the right to that auto-
matic bid, a handy way of cutting
claiming a share of Tournament
money.

Most Division I schools gen-
erate revenue through football and
basketball to fund the other sports

in which they field teams. With the
drop to Division III in football,
though, Davidson can no longer
make money through football. And
if the basketball ‘team is not re-
warded for its success in the Big
South withan NCAA Tournament
bid and a piece of the TV pie, and
cannot schedule big name oppo-
nents (another looming possibil-
ity) for much-needed exposure,
those other sports may well disap-
pear.

Davidsonian: With conference
affiliation and football’s transition
to Division III nearly complete,
what lies ahead for Davidson ath-
letics?

Holland: “First of all, we have to
show that we can compete withthe
conference. The Big South is a
league that has better basketball
and all sports than most people
realize, particularly basketball be-
cause that’s the one that’s so ex-
posed today. It has not had that
exposure because of the lack of
television.... We’ ve got to get our-
selves to a competitive level to

compete with those teams.

“T like the Big South for a lot
of reasons. I like it geographi-
cally, which also helps us finan-
cially, but that’s not the critical
factor fora Davidson. The critical
factor for us was not having to
miss class to travel and that type
of thing. It’sa very good location.
Throw in the fact that we now
have an NCAA basketball bid and
a lot of things really start to fall
into place very quickly.

"The real key, though, is can
we compete? And the only way to
put ourselves in a position to do
that is to continue to improve our
facilities and to look at the grant
situation. What exactly are we
going to have to do to be able to
stay Division I in total.

“So we’re going to be looking
at those issues, and they’re pri-
marily money issues.’ What is
Davidson’s niche? How much
moncy should Davidson be spend-
ing on athletics? Our approach is
that the college budgets a tremen-
dous amount for athletics already,
and what we’ve found is that we
spend more than most Division I
schools on a per-student basis,
and the reason for that is because
we don’t generate revenue. Divi-

13 , 1990 11

sion III programs quite often spend
more than we do. Buta Division I
program has the chance to gencr-
ate revenue, both through gate re-
ceipts as well as through fundrais-
ing. And while we’ ve done a de-
cent job in those areas, those are
areas that we will have toimprove.

“We will try to solidify the
basic support of the fundraising
effort without siphoning money
off of the Campaign. We’re look-
ing fornew moncy. We’re looking
for pcople who have not given,
whohave avery specific interestin
Davidson athletics. And the other
end is promoting our athletics, that
we charge admissions to gencrate
enough revenue for Baker Sports
Complex.

"Belk Arcna scats close to
6,000 people. With only 1400 stu-
dents and a faculty of our size, we
can give all of our students and
faculty members tickets and still
have as many tickcts to scll as
Duke, Virginia and a lot of other
places. We just have not been able
to put a product out on the court in
recentycars that people would nec-
essarily want to come sce, and
haven’t done as good a job in pro-
moting that product. So that’s re-
ally where we’re going to go.”
