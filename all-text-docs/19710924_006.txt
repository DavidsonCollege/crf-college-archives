HOWARD BOYD [

Assistant Sports Editor 4

Well, here it is the second week of the flickerball
season and I'm just now getting around to making my
“pre-season” forecast. Oh, well. after my horrendous pre-
dictions last vear. | need all the help I can get. Without
further ado, then, into the brink:

League A
Division |

1. Delts—After winning: 44 of their last 45 games,
the defending champions appear a little weaker after
heavy graduation losses, but still should walk off with
divisional honors. All-star tailback Bick Halligan keys the
offense, with understanding assistance from Jim Brown,
Bill McIwain and Jack Hartman. returning from Europe.
Veteran Hugh Gaither. ex-footballer Andy Ingles and
Soph Mitch Purvis spearhead an aggressive offense.

2. ATO—The Taus hope to snap back from off-year,
but lost some key players via diplomas. Tailback Mitchell
Johnson, Chipper Jones and Bill Gupton form a _ solid
backfield corps, while versatile Jim Ray, speedy Kent
Beard and Joel Bradley are the ends, while Dave Crumpler
and Bill Sherwood round out the line-up. The Taus lack
depth. but have good speed and should be improved. Dun-
can McGooghan rates as top soph.

3. Cannon |—Cannon ! could be a frosh team to watch.
John Scholer, Gray Lindsay. Bob Ames, Tom Hibbet, Tom
Prince. John Fowler and Kahuna James (that’s right) form
the nucleus of what may develop into a solid outfit with
seasoning.

4. Betas—The problem of combining two groups into
one cohesive unit has hindered the Betas organizational
efforts, which are usually poor. However, although not
as fast. the Betas have a potentially solid squad which
may come on strong in late season. Tailback Al Trostorff
sparks the attack. with help from steady Scott Nicholson
and rangy John Douglas at ends. Powerful Greg Cameron
goes both ways at halfback and heads a tough defense
along with veterans Earl Ellis and Ed Dietrich and flashy
‘Randy Ely. Betas need more offensive punch to go with
good defense to challenge for playoffs.

5. Watts |—A difficult team to assess. Watts I hasn't
shown much offense, but appears to be fairly sound de-
fensively. With added offensive power they could give
Taus. Cannon I and Betas a battle for second. Offensive
stickouts include tailback John Hornickel, halfback Barney
Brewton and Jack Greer, and ends Woody Van Meter and
Bobby Avary. On defense, Rick Quimby. Fred Krieg, Dave
Ward and Bill Morris lead the charge.

Division 1

1. Sigs—The Sigs led league until mid season injuries
felled them a vear ago. Once again they have great talent,
perhaps the best depth in the league, and superior speed.
Fireplug tailback Bill Barnhill, seasoned vet Dave Russell
at halfback. quick guard Billy Clark, and ex-varsity quart-
erback Greg Gerdy spark the attack force. Cooper Geraty,
Randy Webster and Dave Griffiths are fleet and talented
as defensive standouts, Frank Clark has good range and
quickness at defensive end. Sigs appear as strong as 1970,
and should wage torrid duel with Pikas for individual
crown.

2 Pikas—The Pikas as usual have good depth. (de-
spite loss of all-purpose Mark Affeldt) plus what is pro-
bably the league’s best backfield in rifle-armed tailback
Blair Abee and fast, elusive halfbacks Pete Spink and
journeyman Will Ryan. All-star performer Ray Sweten-
burg has all the tools at rusher and offensive end. Cager
John Pecorak looms large at defensive end, while well-
travelled Tom Ross teams with Swetenburg at offensive
flanker. Steady vet Allen Woodward at center, and speed
marchant Dave Mehlen at guard anchor the line. Muscular
Greg Gandee, elusive Bill Lear, dependable old hand
Grier Newlin and Alex Gordon and experienced Bob
Randall make a strong bench.

3. Cannon-Watts—This could be the best of the fresh-
men teams. Andy Langford, Chuck Gladu, Dan Hender-
son, Bobby Clayton, John Lemon, Tim Rogers, Denson
Hargrave and Mark Conners are the principal performers.
The offense looks to be explosive, but the defense has
yet to be tested. They will have a difficult time making
the play-offs due to Sigs and Pikas.

4. Emanon Il—-A weak team but could play spoiler
role. Tailback Dave Parkhurst is the chief offensive oper-
ator. Vet Tom Sinks, mammoth Charlie Kilgore, Phil Drake
and Dan Harkinson, Frank Sommerville and John Doug-
las are other top players.

5. Nus—Should be improved over last year, but that’s
not saying much. Tailback Tom Jenkins and end Bill Sims
are team leaders. Experienced hands Jim Stanfield, Charlie
Davis and Bill Humbert join newcomers Scott Schreiber
and Andy Bailey to form nucleus of, squad. Defense is the
strong point, while offense lacks punch.

; Freshmen Run Cake Race

Despite Cancellation Threats

By BILL MORRIS
Sports Writer

After one delay due to  post-
ponement and despite the threat
of a boycott of a “‘useless and
outmoded” tradition, the 36th
running of the annual Fresh-
man Cake Race took place as
scheduled last Tuesday.

The race began on the start-
ing line, which is appropriate
for most races usually start
there, with most of the fresh-
men participating in spite of
the efforts to induce them to
boycott.

With the sound of the gun the
mass of freshman surged for-
ward across the soccer field to-
ward where the course led
down into the woods. In the
same general area was part of
the Davidson football team. I
bet Coach Fagg wishes he had
a pass rush like that.

The screaming hordes, mean-
While, had made it into the
woods and it was fun to see if
the guy ahead of you made it
as he tried to squeeze past be-
tween some guys on the right
and this big pine tree on the
left.

It was even funnier if he
didn’t make it. You laughed as
you stepped on him and went
on.

The woods were nice if you
were a Boy Scout but the fun
began when we_ hit Concord
Road and began the climb.
About half way up on the side
of the road was a_ sign that
said, ‘‘Begin 35 MPH 1000 Feet
Ahead” so things slowed down
for awhile, but picked up as the
leaders pounded down toward
Jackson Court and the turnoff
for the final burst of speed.

(Notice those action verbs.
You can tell I watch Howard
Cosell and Don Meredith on

Monday Night TV.)

The Freshman finally
gered into Richardson Field
and onto the track and after
9:21.5 seconds of fun Ricky Bell
led the rest of the freshmen
across the finish line.

Of course the six freshman
cross country runners took the
first six places, they knew

stag-

where all the trees were (I
wonder what ever happened to
that guy I stepped on?).

Watts dorm took seven of the
top fifteen places and Don Long
deserves acclaim for being the
last freshman to finish. Sym-
pathies also should be extended
to No. 81.

So ended another cake race.

Booters Host Methodist

The Davidson soccer team
opens its season tomorrow aft-
ernoon with a home’ game
against Methodist College.

The Wildcat team has been
acclaimed by coaches and play-
ers as an improvement over
last year's Southern Conference
champs.

In their first appearance last
Saturday, the booters defeated
the Charlotte Soccer Club 4-0.

The game was called early by :
soccer coach Harry Fogleman
due to the threat of developing
fights.

The Wildcats will meet Meth-
odist at 2 p.m. tomorrow on
Sprunt Field.

Last Tuesday Dick Levan was
elected captain of the Davidson
team. This is the second year
he has filled that position.
