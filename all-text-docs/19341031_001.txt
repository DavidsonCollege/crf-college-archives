“Wurzel Flumery” And “A Night
At An Inn’”’ Presented By
College Dramatists

The Red and Black Masquers, on
Tuesday night, October 23, at 8:30
o'clock, presented the first set of their
series of plays to be produced this year.
The plays were received by a small but
appreciative crowd.

The light spirit of Mulne’s WURZEL
FLUMERY was executed by a complete
Freshman However, the play
which attracted most attention and con-
siderable praiseful comment was Duns-
any’s “A NIGHT AT AN INN”. The
radical departure of the stage setting of
the last mentioned play brought forth
much enthusiastic praise from those who
saw it. Much credit is due those mem-
bers of the technical staff and the cast
who spent their afternoons for two
weeks or more in the construction of
the frame work, the panelling and the
lighting effects for the inn scene. ‘The
set itself, something entirely new here,
was a sort of collective brain trial of

was worked out on paper first, then ac-
tually constructed by students entirely,

The lighting effect was very clever. A
triangular box of lights covered with
blue cellophane created the desired weird
effect. This box, placed behind the base-
board, threw the mysterious blue light
on the cyclorama curtain to picture the
distant sky. ‘The entire setting and par-
ticularly the lighting, blended perfectly
for the scene.

Extension Wire

Will Be Dependent Upon Action

PROGRAMS WILL BE VARIED
Broadcasts Will Be Made From
Chambers Auditorium

Because of the inconvenience of taking
a number of the members of the stu-
dent body to Charlotte weekly to broad-
cast the regular Davidson programs over
station WBT, the school, represented by
Mr. Grier Martin, priced wire from
various big concerns, the intention being
to run such a wire from the college to

the station in Charlotte, so that pro-
grams could be broadcast from the
campus.

At last finding a wire whose price fit-
ted into the school’s budget, Mr. Martin
made arrangements to have it installed,
only to find that the wire in question was
of an inferior sort which would transmit
a speaker's voice only, while accommo-
dating no music at all. This discovery
seemed to definitely close the matter.

Recently, however, a representative of
the Columbia Broadcasting System, of
which WBT is a part, was in Charlotte,
where heSdiscussed this matter with Mr.
Schudt, an executive of station WBT.
It was agreed then that the Columbia
Broadcasting System would authorize
station WBT to aid in the financing of
the plan, so that the cost to the College
would be reduced to some degree.

At the time The Davidsonian went to
press no definite action had been decided
upon, as the matter was to be referred
the Committee of the
soard of ‘Trustees, which met yesterday,
October 30th. If the committee sane-
tions the expenditure, the wire should be
installed immediately, and it is probable
that the first program willy be broadcast
from the Davidson campus on
night.

Should the committee notz think the
project a wise one, it is believed that the
programs will continue to originate in
the studios of station WBT.

In the event that the extension line is
secured, the first program which will be
