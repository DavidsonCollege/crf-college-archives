Hedgepeth;, Jacksonville, Fla.; Linda
L. Hoopes, Clearwater, Fla.; Diana
P. Pierce, Gainesville, Fla.; Mark C.
Thomas, Tarpon Springs, Fla.

The awarding of the scholarships,
announced Wednesday by the Direc-
tors of the Stuart Scholarship Prog-

ram, culminated a series of area,!

district, and final nominations and
interviews.

Craven and Waddill have accepted
their scholarships. and will enter
Davidson’s freshman class next Sep-
tember.

Each of the eight others has until
May 1 to indicate whether he/she
will accept the $500 or forfeit it and
attend another college.

The initial scholarship grants are
renewable for a total of four years of
study at Davidson.

Seddon Goode, Jr., Chairman of
the Scholarship Fund’s Board of
Directors, indicated that this year’s
experience in administering the
Scholars ait program would likely

bring changes for next year.

‘‘We hope we can increase the
number of big scholarships and
amount of those awards into the
#4000 range.

Goode said that the program

probably could not expand into the
entire Southeast next year, but he
hopes that at least three more states
can be added to North Carolina ‘and
Florida.

“I also hope we can make a profile.

on the semi-finalists so those nomina-
ting will know the calibre of the
people we are competing for.”’

Two Stuart finalists received schol-
ded not to participate in the final
interviews.

- One accepted a substantial grant
from Vanderbilt University, the other
took a Morehead Scholarship from the
University of North Carolina.

“We hoped we would lose some, to
make sure we were in the right well of
water,” said Goode.

“We had other Morehead finalists
in our competition, but they didn’t
make it to the final twelve.”’

Others participating in the Stuart
Program were competing for scholar-
ships from Duke, Wake Forest, and
other universities.

Goode reemphasized that ‘‘Chris-
tian character is the cornerstone of
this program.”’

He explained that outstanding
students of the Jewish faith and other
students could compete for conven-
tional scholarships offered by the
college.

Davidson College has no

specific priority system to
determine major expenditures,
according to College President
Samuel R. Spencer, Jr. In-
stead the scale of a project
determines whether it will be
initiated or not.

“You don’t wait on a $2000
or $5000 need until you fill a
million dollar need—for ob-
vious reasons—if you can
fulfill the smaller need,’’ he
said.

“7 think you put major
capital priorities into group-

ings,’’ said Spencer. “Coming
out of our goals committee and
as a part of our case-study
there are several capital pro-
jects that are so desirable to
somebody in the college we
would like to do them right
away.

Spencer listed these projects
as the renovation of Martin
Chemistry Building, new din-
ing facilities, a new art build-
ing for visual arts, music and
drama, and recreational faci-
lities—athletic fields, a field
house for intramurals and a
golf course.

“Housing goes into a sepa-

rate category for this reason,”’
he said, ‘‘we hope to be able
when we build a dorm to build
one to be an income producing
project.”

Spencer hopes to borrow
money for the building and to
repay the loan through stu-
dent room rental.

Renovation of the College
Infirmary is not included in
the top priority list because,
“I’ve been assuming it would
not be a major outlay although
it would perhaps be substan-
tial,’’ he said. “I really don’t

merman received his graduate

, education at Harvard Univer-

sity and the University of
Florence.

His Postgraduate Fellow-
ships include Reed College
Humanities Institute, Senior
Research Fellow; Villa I.
Tatti, Harvard Center for
Italian Renaissance Studies;
and the American Council of
Learned Societies Fellowship.

Dr. Spencer is pleased with
the appointment. He com-
ments, ‘‘Price Zimmerman
combines to an unusual degree
high competence and deep
commitment. His credentials
are impeccable and his record
most impressive.”’

Zimmerman has written
for numerous scholarly pub-
lications, primarily on Paolo
Giorio, a prominent 16th cen-
tury Italian historian. He is an
internationally - recognized
authority on Giorio, and was
one of a few American scholars
asked to contribute to the
recent Dictionary of Italian
Biography published in Italy.

He plans to contribute his
expertise to the history de-
partment at Davidson. As the
Dean at Reed College says, ‘‘I
don’t know any faculty mem-
ber who has better relations
with students. He has cordial,
friendly relationships with a
wide range of students.”’

A former colleague adds, ‘‘I
have read a number of Profes-
sor Zimmerman’s articles and
they are of the highest quality.

His academic standards are
the highest. Professor Zim-
merman has a ruthless eye for
hypocrisy and superficiality.
This is coupled with a gift for
subtle humor.”’

The. colleague goes on to
say, ‘He has a genuine ability
to laugh at himself. Although
reserved in demeanor, he en-
joys people and moves easily
in a wide range of humanistic
fields and the good sense to
listen to others in areas out-
side his competence. He is a
person of unquestioned inte-
grity and moral probity.”

A professional associate
comments, “‘his deep insight,
sense of proportion, astute
handling of persons and situa-
tions and his ‘unflappable na-
ture served the humanists’
cause generously and un-
failingly. Not the least has
been his keen appreciation of
financial matters.’”’

“I need hardly dwell on
Price Zimmermann’s interna-
tional outlook. He has a great
appreciation of locale and the
local scene without being paro-
chial. Nor would he have
problems with any part of
your community whether po-
tential donors, community
leaders, demanding deans and
department heads or sports-

He adds, ‘‘As you must
recognize, we do not want to
lose Price Zimmerman, but we
