We're Lucky

\ student in a southern college is very,
very fortunate compared to one in a col-
lege on the west coast when it comes to
his associates. The reason for this is that
the west coast has become one of the great-
est hotbeds of un-American activities in
the country, due mainly to the multitude of
aliens that has migrated to the “land of
sunshine.” If it is the sunshine that attracts
this type of person, we may feel reasonably
certain that Davidson wilenever be infested
with them! But seriously, nothing could
give a school or a section of the country
more of a black eye than to have such an
unpatriotic exhibition, sd

While these radical movements are sup-
ported only by a decided minority of ,stu-
dents who are stirred up by outsiders, still
they are planting a seed which may grow
into a very troublesome plant. One of the
most amazing things is that the college
publications give these movements plenty
of publicity.

There group the
Peoples’ Socialist League, which has a few

is one called Young
of the more radical as its members. During
a recent convention of a national military
fraternity, this group circulated propaganda
and the
even went so far as to suggest that all mem-
bers of the R, O. T. C. cut a special drill
which was being held in honor of the dele-

cartoons about convention, and

gates. The suggestion was not carried out,
but the fact remains that a group of col-
lege students was allowed to advocate such
a thing without being punished or restrict-
ed in any way.

It is bad enough to have a movement of
this nature in any part of the country, but
it would be much worse to have it spread
to this section. It is the duty of every Amer-
ican student to work against this or any
“ism” which have as their goal the under-
‘mining of our government. For no matter
if you are the best doctor, engineer, lawyer,
or what have you, you wouldn’t do much
good without a country to work in that
was run by an organized government based
on democratic principles.

A Gentleman

So you’re a gentleman? There are a lot
of men on this campus who maintain that
they are gentlemén because they dress cor-
rectly, know which fork to use, and can
carry on a polite and intelligent conversa-
tion. They come from families: which are
well known and of them
can drink their whiskey “like an old South-
ern colonel, suh!” However, we have a pet
idea that these things are not requisite of a
true gentleman; they may help a man into
society, but the “gentleman” of the society
and rotogravure pages of the Sunday pa-
pers are not necessarily gentlemen, ac-
cording to our idea.

We believe that a man is a gentleman
only when he is considerate of others. He
considers the feelings and the property of
others.and the effect that any act or word
of his might have on another person. One
hasan ‘unequalled opportunity to show that

admired. Some

he is a gentleman on the college campus.
He is thrown as closely with other péople
as he will ever be, and his actions here have
more effect on other people than they proh-
ably ever will.

The gentleman on the college campus is
careful in what he says to his fellows be-
cause of the effect that it might have on
their he not hurt

feelings ; does anyone

of his fellow-students; he borrows as
He regards the property of his own college
and the property of other institutions; he
does, not mark ,on walls, carelessly break
Windows, or do anything that might halt
development of the beauty of his campus.
He regards the time and comfort of his
tellow-students; he does not visit a friend
who is trying to study, and he is as quiet
as possible while those who live around him
are trying to study or sleep. The gentle-
man does not cause his professors any un-
due trouble by arriving to class late or
making any disturbance during the class;
he regards these who serve him at his eat-
ing place and arrives to meals on time; he
regards the janitors as well as the beauty
of his surroundings by refusing to throw
trash on the floors of the college buildings
or on the campus grounds, The gentleman
shows his appreciation to those who extend
to him credit by paying his bills promptly.
A gentleman is careful that his influence
does not harm those who might be influ-
enced by it. Every student is the ideal of
somebody, and he should think of the in-
fluence any act of his would have upon the
person who looks up to him—a gentleman
would.

It’s hard to be a gentleman, but it is pos-
sible. A man may wear overalls to church,
eat with his knife, and-be able to talk only
of the way the fish are biting in Hog Run
Creek, but if he is considerate of those he
comes in contact with, we would call him
a gentleman in the strictest sense of the
word.

So you're a gentleman? Let’s see you
prove it.

—The Wake Forest Student.

which contains the greatest diversification
of sports at Davidson, and one that can be
expressed in two words, “Spring Sports.”

Undoubtedly more boys participate in
sports during the spring than at any other
season of the year. With the multiplicity
of sports, suchas track, tennis, baseball,
and golf our athletic fields are filled with
men from March through May.

All of these teams representing Davidson
deserve and merit the support of the student
body. Competition with other colleges will
begin at the conclusion of spring holidays
and continue for a period of six weeks. But
the at at
Davidson in the spring is always below

par in comparison with attendance at our
fall and winter games. It is true that this is
partially explainable by the fact that some
of the events take place on the week-ends,
a time when a large portion of the student
body is away from the campus. But if the
schedule is examined closely we find that a
large percentage of the track meets, base-
ball games, and tennis matches are held

they are justly entitled to any
praise we could give them, we find that
spring sports taken as a group have been
as successful as any other. Then too, the
athletes can perform with more of the old
determination and fight with a large crowd
on hand to imbue them with the Davidson
spirit.

But you might retaliate with the observa-
tion that spring sports do not carry as much
color or excitement as football or basket-
ball. However, the idea was probably for-
mulated unthinkingly. Who can deny that
the lightning-like dashes of track meets,
the close plays, long base hits and impos-
sible catches of baseball are replete with
thrills ?

The football, basketball, and wrestling
teams have deserved all the recognition
given them by sports writers throughout
the Carolinas, the cagers in particular hav-
ing had a highly successful season, They
have been teams that made us proud of
Davidson and her athletics. So let’s give

R.O.T.C. That old question of| “War Whoop” on the move: “This

state offers plenty of opportunities
for military training at other
schools for those who want it. To
make such training compulsory at
our state university is an unneces-
sary handicap to the institution.”

At Tennessee Polytechnic Insti-
tute, the “Oracle” requests the es-
tablishment of a unit in these
words: “On account of this lack,
the students who are regularly
trained in college courses leave the
institution without the military
training that would be so beneficial
in case of a national emergency.
Therefore, the students of R. O. T,
C. units at other institutions would
become the leaders in war, and the
erstwhile Tech students would have
to take second place.”

At Alabama Polytechnic Insti-
tute, the “Plainsman” asks that
students take their military train-
ing more seriously, that they rea-
lize that their classes in military
science and tactics are part of the
nation’s great defense program.

For one thing there is the mat-
ter of sick cuts. It hardly seems
fair that a man should be forced
take an examination on work
missed because of a lengthy illness
when this is not required for work
missed on band trips, deputations,
and athletic trips. While the reg-
ular three absences allowed will
cover most cases of sickness, still
they often do not. We cannot see
the logic in helping fellows in
every way when they are repre-
senting the college and then not
given an even break to those who
are incapacitated by circumstances
over which they have little if no
control.

Then we wonder why it is that
such a large percentage of the band
each year is composed of fresh-

tion. Also, why is it necessary to
force members of certain musical
groups to stay in these groups for
a whole year when they have once
signed up. Can it be that the ardor
of the freshmen for entering musi-
cal activities cools just as’ soon as
they learn the rating these groups
have with the Student Body, and
the way membership to musical or-
ganizations conflicts with work in
more highly rated fields of extra-
curricular activities.

Most of the most moronic things
that we have seen lately was the
“great fun” several Davidsons had
last week feeding great quantities
of Ex-Lax to Gluecose,
the pup. Fun is fun and all that,
but when it comes to torturing a
poor, dumb animal in so thought-
less a manner it appears more like
a trick you would expect from the
“Dead End Kids” than the prank
of men with enough education to
be going to college. Sometimes we
wonder,

“Since they make so much of

war were mostly common Ameri-
cans themselves. And in that fight
the Americans were seeking just
the freedom and tolerance which
the D.A.R. is doing its best to abol-
ish,” said the Cornell University
“Sun” of the incident.

More yigorous in its denuncia-
tion of the act, the Muhlenberg
College “Weekly” had this to say:
“The D.A.R. has finally declared it-
self. The perpetration of the most
dastardly stunt in the annals of this
supposedly super-patriotic organiza-
tion has placed the group beyond

the pale of right-thinking Ameri-
