Amerikkka's most wanted in the house again

By Rafael Candelario and
Travis Hinson

R- Wuz up Rock! It’s nice to
be Black again inaction. Speaking
of Black, in this time of Political
Correctness, what word best de-
scribes you: Black, African-
American, or Negro?

T- Well, as I reflect Black on
my education thus far, it is my
opinion and strong belief that
negroes are a figment of Mr.
Charlie’s imagination. It refers to
an imaginary group of savages that
come from some imaginary conti-
nent. I no longer consider myself
a negro!

R- Word! Just look at the
word n-e-g-r-o, and any genius
should be able to tell that it is the
Spanish word for “black.” The

damned colonists just couldn’t pro-
nounce it properly. “Negro”
doesn’t describe a race of people,
but rather a physical characteris-
tic—Black.

T- Yo, Wuz up?! I’m not
black, I’m brown. The streets are
black. Inkisblack. The bottoms of
some people’s feet are black (Wear
some shoes!!). :

NowthatI think aboutit, white
people aren’t white, they’re pink!
What’s this obsession with skin
color?

R-Idon’teven know. ButIdo
know that this racism crap wasn’t
prevalent until slavery in the
Americas. The Moors in Spain
were black, but they were described
by religion and not by skin color.
Now white people are white, but

only three hundred years ago they
were recognized by their national-
ity and/orreligion: English, Span-
ish, Russian, French, Dutch. They
were enemies against each other
that became MR. CHARLIE vs.
the so-called “Negroes.”

T- I guess we’ve doneitagain.
It seemsas though whenever some-
one uses a negatively viewed word
to describe us, we turn it into a
positive.

Take the word “black.”
Webster’s Dictionary defines
“black” as “destitute of light; dark;
gloomy; sullen;
wicked.” I preferto think of “black”
as “encompassing the entire spec-
trum; proud; sociable; honorable;
just.” In other words, “Black is
Beautiful!” If it isn’t, why are

atrocious;

caucasians always out in the sun
trying to get darker?

R- I guess they want skin
cancer! On the serious tip, I guess
African-American describes us
best. We are an accumulation of
races and color, almost like Mexi-
cans. None of us can say we are
pure Zulu, and I won’t even men-
tion the over three million
“negroes” that passed for white in
the last ninety years. (Hint: lookat
some of “white” people’s features).
Inthe long run, we are just children
of Goddess, who got caught in the
historical trap of miseducation due
to the fears and ignorance ofa few.

T- I guess I can tolerate being
called African-American. The
truth of the matter is, I recently
learned that Ihave Cherokee inmy

blood. I also learned that (you’re
gonna love this!) Ihave German in
my blood. Ihave just as much right
to call myself a Native American
or German American. Not that I
would ever want to be called Ger-
man. Thank Goddess I have a
natural tan!!

R-Iconcur, dude! Goddess is
great, SHE is the most powerful
and beautiful beingin the universe.
HER long, wooly hair, lightbrown
eyes with a hint of green, and that
Caribbean tan. I’m sure SHE will
lead us black into the white, and
people will just be people once
again!

T-As a final note, if you think
we’reatad bit too radical, 2 tearsin
a bucket! Please, don’t hate us
because we’re dark and lovely!!!

Recycling bins should litter halls

By Dan Parham

Unfortunately, I missed the
freshman student senatorial
speeches Monday night. Yet, upon
reflection, probably more ideol-
ogy was discussed among our stu-
dent body over the few, over-
priced, yet spiritually filling pitch-
ers at the pub. Certainly the candi-
dates discussed their euphoric plans
to correct the problems plaguing
our campus. Who determines the
priority of issues?

My democratic right was pen-
ciled to three faceless freshman
who made the conscious decision
not to campaign (which was a bit
disappointing...our hall bulletins
needed a few more witty flyers)—
not to say that there were not those
who actually had ideas; it‘s just
that the fluorescent ballot seemed
to melt my brain under the cam-

paign madness.

Perhaps if the candidates had
posted their views on pertinent is-
sues such as the verminous
odiferous (albinoskunk) invasion,
I might have had the personal in-
centive to vote, sans negligence. |
do hope the senators not only iden-
tify but also attempt solutions to
some of the basic flaws of the
school.

Davidsonisacommunity, pre-
sumably an educated and con-
cerned one, that needs a sufficient
system of recycling aluminum,
plastics, and glass. There are recy-
cling bins—I chanced across one
as I stumbled into Duke trying to
quell the shakes of a Mello-Yello
deficiency.

Though I seem to stumble fre-
quently, I haven’t stumbled into
many recycling areas. Actually, I

haven’t been looking for a place to
recycle. I shouldn’t have to. We
have a responsibility to our envi-
ronment, but that awareness is eas-
ily lost with many other responsi-
bilities after a few spiritual beers.

Wherever there are trash cans,
the college should place recycling
bins (especially in dormitory bath-
rooms—who wants to draga moist
trashbag of stagnant beer across
campus to the union, with a hang-
over, no less?).

Ourcommunity’s intellectual
ideals must be accompanied by
pragmatic efforts if we are to have
progress.

Plus, Davidson would be a
happier place if everyone knew
that the cans they emptied would
someday be returned to them, com-
plete with hops.

Losing the power to control your life

By Ashlyn Dannelly

Last weekend, I witnessed a
thought-provoking scene. I saw a
nineteen year-old friend struggling
under the weight of his father’s
casket as he climbed up a hill to the
gravesite. Fora moment, I thought
he would lose his grip, buthe found
the strength to make it to the top.

Three weeks ago, the boy
drove away from my house after
saying his farewells, headed to-
ward a freshly-realized goal: col-
lege. After a year at a community
college, he found the gumption to
take out a student loan so he could
travel away to school and experi-
ence life on his own.

Then, on Saturday, he buried
his father, a thirty-nine year old
truck driver who had a heart attack
in his shower just hours before he
was to travel on the road again.

Suddenly, talk shifted from
classes and new friends to car pay-
ments and house payments. Just a
few seconds of agony transported
my friend from the dependent,
youthful state in which most of us
revel toa state of unknown respon-
sibility.

For now, he will remain in
school, but the future is up in the
air. In his eyes, he is now the man
of the house, relegated to support-
ing his mother and younger sister
and aiding them with their immea-
surable grief.

Watching his plight has caused
me to do some self-examination.
Last weekend made me realize for
the first time how simplistic my
life is. My thoughts center on
family, friends, and studying. I
cannot imagine having the future
(not to mention an incredible

amount of grief) dumped in my lap
tomorrow.

Now, there lies a huge differ-
ence between my friend and me: I
have multitudes of choices regard-
ing what courses of action to take
with my life, whereas he does not.

Ihave anew-found respect for
the strength of those people who,
like my friend, have few choices.
Because of circumstances beyond
anyone’s control, their lives’
courses are determined for and not
by them. At any age, that is a
staggering load to carry.

At Davidson, we too often take
for granted our ability to attend
college and experience such acare-
free life. There are many people
out there who would give anything
to be as fortunate as we are. We
should appreciate and enjoy this
life while it lasts.

Racism of any sort can't

Rogers continued from page 7

Granted, there are racist whites
at Davidson, but those few persons
do not constitute the general atti-
tude of Davidson whites toward
Davidson blacks. The general atti-
tude of Davidson whites to
Davidson blacks seems to me to be
one of acceptance, not one of ill
will or hatred. oe

Moreover, Mr. Candelario’s
and Mr. Hinson’s sentiments do
not serve to bring the campus com-
munity together.

s Rather, by strongly insinuat-
ing a white conspiracy against
blacks and by placing such strong

‘emphasis on the separateness of

their own race, the two authors act
to. divide fhe, SQmmMygity -further

be accepted

Davidson simply does not
need this sort of divisive attitude.
It is an emotional attitude of un-
educated persons, not one of think-
ing individuals. We cannot move
closer to becoming the elusive
“Davidson family” by countering
supposed white racism with black
racism.

Stop self-segregation

By Tene Moore &
Chris Edmonston

In keeping with the tradition
begun last year by Scott Windham
and Deidra Montague, we have
chosen to continue writing about
issues that impact both black and
white Davidson students. We hope
specifically to address student race
relations and minority concerns
within our community.

Keep in mind that we are not
attempting to represent the black
or white races as a whole; how-
ever, we are simply giving per-
sonal opinions and analysis. Our
goal is to shed light upon some
gray areas that separate people of
different cultural backgrounds.

Self-segregation in the class-
room, the Commons, the library,
and sporting and social events is a
reality of life at our college. We all
are guilty.

Whatisself-segregation? We
define self-segregation as the un-
intentional separation of ourselves
from those whoare different in any
way. How many times have you
seen a white man dancing with a
black woman at a party? Or, how

honestly place blame on anyone,
but everybody can play a part in
conquering self-segregation.

We are not advocating insin-
cere gestures of friendship towards
people of different races, but we
are advocating sincere “steppin’-
out” and moving away from nor-
mal boundaries. Too often we
assume that other races will not
welcome us, when this may not
always be true.

Take a chance. Invite some-
one you do not know to a meal.
Listen to a James Brown or Neil
Diamond tape. Try on an “X” hat
or a pair of Tevas. Even if your
actions are not accepted or under-
stood by others, be confident that if
nothing else you will have had an
invaluable outside the classroom
experience.

Too often we expect others to
make the first move, or more com-
monly place too much responsibil-
ity for change upon those consid-
ered minorities. Self-segregation
will exist in its many forms until
we all start taking chances. Next
time you go toa football or soccer
game, next time you walk into the
Commons, take a laok around and
