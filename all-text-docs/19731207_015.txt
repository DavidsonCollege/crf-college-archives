Dorms To Inspire Communal Living

President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. announced plans
yesterday to begin con-
struction of five new dor-
mitories in February.

Thanks to the savvy of Vice
President of Finance and
Development C. David Cor-
nell, the college has received a
million dollar grant from the
federal government for the
new
neat mie seching

funds, dollar for dollar, with
contributions from alumni and
friends,” said Cornell.

“This has proven to work
very effectively in the past.
For example, the college gave
President Nixon $1 million
during the 1972 Presidential

campaign, and we’re now

‘After studying these
detailed plans, I’ve decided to
build the new dormitories the
Jim Walters way,’’ said Spen-

“Walters’ plans show a true
sensitivity to student needs

and the prevailing campus ar
chitectural style. T couldn't be
more pleased.”’

To help defray rising tuition

According to General
Manager Harriet Beecher
Sow, “We have been en-
couraged by the amount of
support given our service by

Already, experienced ad-
visors from Mooresville have
shown much enthusiasm for

the project.

“Generally, we just need a
little more work on our

One of the male recipients of
the coed service, William
Wash has voiced the sen-
timent of most participants.
“It’s a temporary diversion
from the rigors of academia.
Instead of playing paddle ball,

Manager Sow has indicated
that not only students but a
surprising number of faculty
and administrators have drop-
ped by for visits to the parlor.

is limited to Third Floor Wat-

as much as the customers do
receiving it.’’

Vice President of Academic
Affairs John M. Bevan stated,
‘“‘Now I can finally say with a
clear conscience that David-
son..offers a_liberal-arts
education.”

Mehe Jim Walters Company
has fabricated some really ex-
citing ideas which will put
Davidson on the map ar-
chitecturally speaking,’’ said

“These buildings will enhan-
ce the beauty of the campus,
following in the tradition of the
new E. H. Little Library and
the Cunningham Fine Arts
Center.”

Walters explained that the
dormitory plans were inspired
by Pablo Picasso’s painting
“‘Guernica.”’

‘“‘We’ve combined the out-
standing features of the New
York slums with the rustic
rural flavor of the outhouse
and the functional qualities of
the Pentagon, to produce a
structure unequalled on any
college campus in the coun-
try,’’ said Walters.

“We're naming the new
housing complex ‘The Ivory
Towers.’ I got the idea while
visiting the White Kastles in
New York City,’’ he added.

Director of Student Housing
Scotty Nichols was elated
upon viewing the plans. ‘‘It’s
just what I wanted,” she said.

“These dormitories were
designed with the student in
mind,”’ said Nicholls. They
contain every modern con-
venience including built in

lofts in individual rooms and
lavatories with water running
hot and cold.”

The dormitories are four
stories high. They aredesigned
to hold 100 students. Each dor-
mitory has 20 rooms plus a
lobby in the basement.

Dean of Students Will H.
Terry indicated his delight in
the new concept in student
living.

“Housing four students to a
room will help develop that
sense of community we strive
to achieve here at Davidson,”’
said Terry. This experiment in
communal living will offer
Davidson’ students’ the
maximum degree of freedom
in developing close personal
relationships which
distinguish Davidson as a
small college geared to the in-
dividual student,” he added.

Director of the Physical
Plant Grover C. Meetze Jr. is
also excited about the new
plans.

“I couldn’t have done better
myself,” said Meetze. ‘These
buildings are designed to in-
sure usage of every inch of
living space. While including
every conceivable  con-
venience, Walters has _ ex-
cluded every space-taking
non-essential including stair-
cases, bathrooms, and
double-file-hallways.

“I’m very impressed with
Walters’ concern to have the

buildings blend smoothly with
the natural foilage of the site.
Low ceilings on all rooms have
kept the height of the dor-

are perfect sights for planting
gozinias,”’ said Meetze.

Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan likewise could find lit-
tle fault with the new housing
plan.

“I am very impressed with
the Jim Walters plan. I am
convinced that this housing
will best indoctrinate David-
son students to the social and
academic character of cam-
pus communal living,’’ Bevan
said.

“I wouldn't mind living
there myself,’’ he added.

One feature which Bevan
dislikes is the lack of stairs or
elevators. He feels that lad-
ders will be an inconvenience.
Terry, however, feels that this
omission will benefit the dor-
mitory inhabitants.

‘Davidson students are just
going to have to realize that in
climbing the ladder of suc-
cess, you can't step on all the
little people on the way up.”
said Terry.

Election Fiasco Ruins Butner

President-elect Blain But-
ner was forced to resign late
Thursday when it was
discovered that he spent
$1,100.53 on campaign
materials during the election
this week.

According to past president
Bo Phillips, $500 of the amount
was allegedly spent on cam-
paign posters, brochures and
handouts, and the remainder
was used to buy off freshmen
votes.

“‘We first noticed something
was fishy when we realized
that there were about 4000
Butner posters on first Cham-
bers,’’ Phillips said. ‘“Those
damned things were stretched
up and down the hall.”’

Noted Psychology Professor
John D. Kelton noted that the
cumulative effect of the ab-
stract lines on the Butner
posters was hypnotic, forcing
students to wander around
campus muttering ‘‘bbb for
sga.”’

It was not known how many
students voted for Butner
without knowing who he was,
or even how many voted
twice.

Kelton tested the effect of
the cunning hypno-posters by
allowing 50 rats to run free in
the classroom building, and
then polling them to see who
they supported in the election.
All but one of the 27 rats
collected indicated a preferen-
ce for Butner.

The 27th rat, according to
Kelton.had a fetish for day-glo
red. °

The elections committee of
the SGA was called into
special session to deal with the
problem, but could find no
part of the SGA by-laws set up
to deal with such emergen-
cies... ..

"They: ‘decided to throw the

issue before a meeting of the
full Senate, but were unable to
gather a quorum of senators
with only a week's notice.
Only Jim Goodloe and Vince
Rabil showed up.

The problem will now be tur-
ned over to the Hearing Com-
mittee because they haven't
had a chance to do anything
yet this year.

Phillips offered to continue
as SGA president until the
scandal was cleaned up.

“This is the kind of martyr
like sacrifice I have become
used to through my long years
of brilliant work in the senate”’
he said.

Phillips indicated that he
would devote all his time and
energy to the problem.

“I hope we can resolve this
thing beforesummer vacation.
My blonde hair and delicate
complexion might otherwise
be damaged by over-exposure

to the lime light.”’

Phillips said that he was
‘shocked and amazed"’ by the
bizarre turn of events in the
election and felt that it would
do little to help the prestige of
the campus politician. By this
point in his press conference,
however, most of the at-
tending press were asleep.

Elections specialist Bob
Corlew expressed surprise at
the amount of money used to
buy votes in the freshman
class.

“It explains why he won on
the first ballot,’’ Corlew said,
“but $500 is about twice the
amount needed to buy those
same votes.”

He said he would recom-
mend that the college remove
Butner from the work
rolls “if he had that kind of
money to throw around.”
