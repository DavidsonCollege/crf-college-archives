Israel to deport Palestinians; violence in South Africa

By KATHERINE PRICE
Headlining the news January 1-7:

Around the World —In a rare move, the
U.S. voted against Israel in a U.N. Security
Council vote. The unanimously approved
vote asks Israel to refrain from deporting
Palestinians. Violence has plagued the
Israeli-occupied territories in the past

month. Over 1,400 Palestinians have been:

arrested by Israel in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip. Threatened deportation of
Palestinian leaders has met with strong
disapproval from the U.S. Israel claims it is

trying to quell fyrther unrest by getting rid
of those who have inciting the riots.

Violence has also been prevalent in
southern Africa, where over 250 blacks
have been killed in fighting in plaggiown-
ships. Warfare has occurred betwétn the
Zulu group Inkatha, led by Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, and the Zulu followers of the
outlawed African National Congress. The
Zulus are the largest tribal group in South
Africa. Pro-ANC supporters disagree with
Buthelezi’s willingness to participate in
negotiations with the white South_African
government.

The USSR may be moving closer to.
withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan. .

Reportedly, the USSR will agree to a year-
long withdrawal of military forces if pro-
tection for departing Soviet troops can be
assured through U.N. negotiations. Soviet
Foreign Minister Shevardnadze is in Af-
ghanistan this week, but no progress on
withdrawal has been announced. The U.S.
continues to support the Afghan rebel
forces. ,

Across the Nation —The U.S. space
program recently suffered setbacks due to

an explosion involving the MX missile and
a disappointing test fire of the shuttle
booster rocket. These developments came
as the Soviets set a record for having aman
in space for eleven months.

Gary Hart ann®unced that he is back in -
the Democratic race for the presidency.
Hart surprised many by reenttring the
contest which he left following a much
publicized personal affair’ with Miami
model Donna Rice. Hart’s new slogan,
“Let the people decide,” brings the charac-
ter issue back to the forefront of the presi-
dential campaign.

opportunity to perform and (sing-
ing in the larger choir) doesn’t
take up that much time on the part
of the students.”

He also finds Albinder to be
“one of the best professors at this
school. He can be very sarcastic,
but Ihave never talked to a student
who did not respect Frank as a
professor -- I have talked to some
who didn’t like him...”

While Fish has sung under the

-direction “of many talented con-

ductors,” he says that “no one puts
together a better program than he,
and he knows his music inside and
out.”

Choir members and students of
Albinder plan to show their sup-
port for him in a variety of ways,
some of which Fish characterizes

as perhaps a little too drastic.

He went on to say, however,
that “We'believe in Frank enough
to support him any way we can.
I’m notexactly sure what that will
entail, but we want to go further
than simply expressing our con-

_cem.”

Senior Wes Hofferbert offered
a view somewhat contrary to that
supported by Fish while express-
ing his support for the decision of
the administration: “I feel that the
Administration has access to a
wide range of information and
that the decision not to renew
Frank’s contract is well-
founded.” ;

Hofferbert_ finds’ no fault in
Albinder’s teaching abilities, but
objects to the lack of discipline in

- the concert choir. “It’s an abso-
lute necessity to have order during

practices -- people talk to each

other, don’t come to practice, and
Frank just will not get tough with
them.”

mittee (PAC) is currently drafting

a proposal which could alter the
faculty evaluation procedure.

According to Committee
Chairman Dr. Cole Barton, “the
first step will probably be to insti-
tute a review of candidates by
their individual departments.”

It would also provide for a Fac-
ulty Review Committee with rep-
resentation from all divisions of
the community “with access to all
information that the Academic
Dean would have,” including
reviews from outside the College
and from key students.”

According to Barton, “there are
good arguments against such an
institution -- for one thing, it

mightcreate tension. How willing _

would a faculty member be to say
that another isnotmeasuring up?”

Regarding confidentiality, Bar-
ton Said that “the Dean is in a

confidential, it might be consid-
ered more credible.”

“If the reasons were legitimate
and were requested in writing and
the Dean sat down and wrote them
out, they would go into the Ar-
chives,” where the College could
be called upon to release them to
prospective employers of the indi-
vidual, Barton said.

“The implications of giving
reasons for a non-renewal or dis-
missal ought to be explained, and
they should be given if they are
constructive criticisms,” Barton
said.

Contract renewal decisions are
based upon distinction in teach-
ing, professional attainments and
the intellectual and moral values
demonstrated in the teacher’s
concern for students and service to

“highly selective plus” category
to the top “most selective” rank-
ing.

Gardner said that whether or not
Davidson comes to be considered
as one of the “most selective”
schools will probably depend
upon its median SAT score fig-
ures. “We'll be very close to line,
and whether or not we’ll make it
over will depend upon our SAT
profile. We’d make it easily if the
criteria were just our applicant-to-
space ratio and the figures report-
ing the class rankings of our stu-
dents.”

Gardner said that Davidson’s
relatively low SAT profile (a
median combined score of 1230
last year) is due more to geogra-
phy than to any failings on the part
of Davidson students: “We take a
large number of our students from
the Southeast where they don’t
have the big board scores like they
have in the North. Students up
there go to expensive SAT psep

courses and take the test eight or

nine times. Our people are just as
good as theirs; ours are just more
relaxed.”

— Gardnéf said thathe wasi’tsure

what had led to the increase in the
number of applications, but that
he “had some hunches.” “Part of
it’s timing,” he said, “the key is
getting the applications out
early.”

The numbers support his hunch:
according to Admissions Office
figures, Davidson had received 23
applications by September 3 of
last year, while in past years it had
received few or none by such an
early date. This year the “early
surge” has carried on at full

_ $trength throughout the year, and __

should end by allowing the Office
of Admissions to post its “best

ours are just more relaxed.”

year ever.”

Gardner said that other factors
affecting this
year’s success
‘may have been
the emphasis
which the Of-
fice is attempt-
ing to place
upon personal
contacts with
applicants. He
said that every
applicant to
Davidson now
receives a per-
sonal letter
from a mem-
* ber of the
Admissions
Office staff,
and that the
basic forms

focus on per-

ships. For ex- |

Office staff on the back.

It may seem strange that
changes in such apparently minor
details of the admissions process
could bring about such increases

in the number of applicants. But -

Gardner says that he thinks this
year’s success is really due to “a
lot of little things adding up. Pay-
ing attention to those kinds of
details is what makes all the dif-
ference in the world.”

Gardner doesn’t think that
Davidson’s recent prominence in
national rankings, such as those
listed in U.S. News and World
Report, have had much todo with
the increase in the number of
applicants. “I don’t believe in
those rankings very much,” Gard-
ner said. “Our position in the U.S.
News survey hasn’t seemed to

last year we really had a good year
here was in 1985, and that was the
year we disappeared from the
ranking.”

Gardner is reserved in his en-
thusiasm about this year’s appar-
ent success; “We don’t want 4000
applications here. We want
enough to remain competitive,
but not so many that we can no
longer provide applicants with the
personal attention they deserve
from Davidson.”

He is also careful to avoid de-
claring victory while the game is
still going on. “This could still fall
through. It could die in the water,”
he says. The admissions year is
not yet over, and although the
predictions are Very rosy indeed,
Davidson will have to await the
spring thaw to learn the final ver-
dict on the success of this year’s
admissions process.
