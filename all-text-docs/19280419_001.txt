tial Poll Held On

College Campus by the Davidsonian

Governor Smith Gets Plurality of

Only Thirty-Two Votes Over
Secretary Hoover

FACULTY PICKS HOOVER

Over Eighty Per Cent of Student
Body Voted in Election

In what was probably the closest col-
legiate election in which straw ballots
have been cast for Governor Alfred E.
Smith of New York and Secretary
Hoover, Davidson’s student body ex-
pressed its opinion that Al Smith, demo-
crat, should be the next President. The
plurality was only thirty-two votes over
Hoover, republican—2o1-169.

In a separate canvass of faculty selec-
tions Hoover proved to be the favorite
with a vote which doubled that of
Smith’s. Members of the administration
who participated in the voting cast 13
votes for Hoover, 6 for,Smith and others
for McAdoo, Meredith, Walsh, Coolidge,
Ritchie, George, Dawes, and Davis.

Response to this movement which was
instigated and carried out by The David-
sonian was above the average with ap-
proximately eighty per cent of the en-
rolled students casting votes. The total
number of votes was 478.

Many . students’ predicted a great land-
slide for Smith while others were just as
certain that Hoover’s plurality would be
large. The poll conducted by The In-
dependent throughout the United States
showed that Hoover was the favorite with
a plurality of one-third over Smith who

As. the time assigned for the Junior |
Speaking festivities draws near, plans for
the week end’s activities are fast nearing |
completion, Carefully guided by the four
committee chairmen details are being
worked out and final plans are being made |
which, it is hoped, will effect an enjoyable
Junior Speaking. Much, interest is being
manifested to whether the radical
changes made by this year’s juniors will
prove to be worthwhile innovations.

According to Mac King, junior presi- |
dent in charge of the entire arrangements, |
the activities will begin Friday night, |
April 27, with the Junior Oratorical Con- |
test in Shearer Hall at 7:30. Other social |
attractions for that night are rumored |
but cannot be substantiated here.

On ‘Saturday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock
there will be a track meet with the team |
from the University of South Carolina. |
A large crowd is expected at this meet |
due to the efficiency already exhibited by |
Capt. John Currie and his cohorts.

Immediately following this meet the
Junior class will be host to the student
body, their guests and the faculty at a
reception on the campus. Saturday night

RETIRING EDITOR

B. F. MARTIN
| Who Retaduieues Editorship of “David-

sonian” in This Issue

Martin, Retiring Editor
of Davidsonian, Shown
to be Outstanding Man

Activities Include Editing, Golfing
and Acting—Good Executive
and Scholar

When Boyce Martin relinquished the
editorshtp of this paper with the issue of
April 4, there passed from the directorate
of The Davidsonian one of the most dis-
tinguished editors of recent years. No
one has held more collegiate honors of
such importance and covering such varied
activities as Martin has.

As editor, golfer, scholar, actor, poet,
executive and popular student he has
carved a name for himself in Davidson's
Hall of Fame which will stand unsur-
passed for some time. °

From.his freshman year Martin has
gained honor after honor until his election
to editor of The Davidsonian and Omi-
cron Delta Kappa climaxed the long list
of accomplishments. As editor he has di-
rected the pursuit of a conservative yet
progressive policy for this paper and has
produced an editorial page which, for its
qualities of good writing, depth of thought
and accuracy- of expression would rank in
the forefront of student publications.

His next bid to campus fame is as a
golfer. Having played on the college

No Report Given as to
Outcome of Inspection

In spite of the fact that Davidson stu-
dents manifested a keen interest in the
outcome of the annual R. O. T. C., inspec-
tion here recently, the reviewing officers,
Colonel Merriam and Major McCaughey,
had little to say concerning the impres-
sion made by the Davidson unit. It is a
war department policy for inspecting of-
ficers of any nature to have little to say
at the time of inspection, in order: that
their final reports may not be anticipated
nor misunderstoéd.

Captain Daugherty, however. expressed
himself as being very optimistic as to the
outcome of the official review of the local
unit. The interest taken by the cadets in
their work and their willingness to help
was the subject of much favorable com-
ment.

Perhaps the most striking feature of
the day, and the part which seemed to im-
press the visitors most, was the entrance

Davidson’s Nine Defeats
Petrels in Close Game

Deciding Run of Game Scored in
Last Half of Ninth Inning

Davidson Wildcats added another victory

to their string Monday, when they defeated
Oglethorpe 7-6 in Concord. The game
was played on the Concord High School
diamond. The game was a nip and tuck.
affair from the very beginning and the
outcome was in doubt until the last half
of the ninth inning.
. The feature of the game was the timely
hitting of “Tuck” McConnell who got five
hits out of five times at the plate. In the
last half of the ninth inning Littlejohn,
the first man up, singled, McAulay fol-
lowed with’& sacrifice and “Tuck” the next
man up doubled to deep center to win the
game which was tied at that time. Ratch-
ford also got his share of the hits with
three out of five times up. .

John McInnis was in good form and
pitched a_ good game before a home
crowd. te

Two snappy double plays were pulled
by the locals by the route of Kugler to
Harrison to Crawford.

The feature of the Oglethorpe team was
the hitting of Wall. In the first half of
the fifth inning Wall connected with one
of McInnis’ fast ones and knocked it over
the fence for a home run, one man was
