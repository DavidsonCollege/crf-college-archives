Outlook...

Davidson men are often accused of living
within too small a sphere. However, Dav-
idson men are not unique in this. The same
is increasingly true of the majority of the
youth of today,

” In order to remedy this unfortunate situ-
there many
campi an organization called the National

ation has been formed on
Students Federation of America.

N.S. F. A. is composed of students from
approximatgly 100 colleges and universities
in all sections of the United States. All of
the groups cooperate to give college youth
a place in national and international afftirs
and to help each other in an effort to im-
prove the local conditions existing in college
government and catiipus situations.

At
meets and formulates the policies which are
the Ne SEAS
representative of the school. At others the

some schools an. executive council

sent to national office as
students themselves are given the oppor-
tunity to meet and formulate their own
campus policies. It is customary to hold
meetings in®the form of an open forum.
Sometimes the question which is put up for
discussion is concerned with national or in-
ternational it
which deals primarily with campus prob-
lems.

Many institutions have found that the
N.S. F. A, forum is, of great benefit to its
students. We at Davidson are altogether
too willing to sit quietly by while the other
fellow formulates and carries out the’plans.
We would do well to take a leaf from the
book of N.S. F. A. and take enough interest

affairs; sometimes is one

in what goes on outside of our small world
to be able to cast an intelligent vote, wheth-
er it be in a campus election or in the race
for the presidency of the country, without
being influenced by the fellow who sits be~
side you in chapel or by the ideas of your
relatives or friends. :

Race Question...
Not voluntarily wishing to reopen an
argument on the negro question, we have
had something put before our eyes that is
not only repulsive, but definitely not in
keeping with the ideas of Davidson men.

This year, as well as last, the student body
of this institution has had forced upon them
the sight of a common type of. negro hold-
ing a prominent position in the football
band. Formerly, he has been dressed in
his own ragged clothing, but at our last
game we saw that he is now entitled to
wear part of the uniform that only David-
son students should wear. A fellow stu-
dent, sitting next to me at the game and
noticing the spectacle, remarked that this
negro disturbed his intestinal fortitude so
much, that he felt that he would be forced
to leave the game.

Knowing the desire of conservatism
that is held by a majority of our students,
it is hoped that our band will not be open
to criticism in this-~way at any time in the
future.

Another thing. The Davidson Wildcat
spirit is not like an ROTC shirt to be worn
only on occasion, but is like your underwear
and is in style all year round. That includes
friendliness on the campus, There are a
few upperclassmen and more freshmen who
hardly ever speak to those they pass on the
campus, and then emit only a growl. By
now you all ought to be able to see that it
is time we snap out of it and get back that
old Wildcat Spirit’that leads to victory.

Dear Bill:

One of distinctive
traditions is degenerating into buf-
foonery. Daily chapel with its de-
votional, its student meetings, and
its frequency does much to improve
Davidson's spirit and democracy;
her friendship and cordiality. Jn
the past few years, the conduct of
students as a group has gradually
become more and more boisterous
so that present conduct endangers

We individual students can
help preserve a Davidson tradition
that valuable, but which is be-
ing endangered by a few whose
acts are very detrimental,

We can use these means to help
make Davidson chapels a benefit:
Our tactfully spoken word, our in-
fluence, our decorous example. We,
acting as individual students, can
keep our chapel from dropping to
a jam-session for the jitter-bugs
and from dwindling to a warped
mirror that reflects the shallow
shines of our silly students.

We individually can improve cha-

cheeks until I scarcely knew
whether I stood at the foot of a
luminous fountain or at fhe edge
of a clearing in the trees. There
I stood among all the fantastic
beauties of the night, but one thing
was lacking—I stood alone.

Now, Editor, that is really a pret-
ty tough situation. How much more
I would have enjoyed the evening
if I could have but had a com-
panion, an understanding compan-
ion, with whom to share the beau-
ties of the evening. As I view Dav-
idson's history in retrospect, I can
only feel that Davidson has not
found its fullest expression, as long
as its membership is limited al-
most unanimously to the type of

student that now fills its noble
halls. How Davidson needs the
type of student that. could have

The type student that I ask
for is a man who is a good com-
panion in the open, who loves na-
ture, who loves good books, and
good music. With such a man for
a companion, I can think of noth-
ing finer than to walk in the woods
and the fields, to talk over our
interests and problems, to share
our joy in the beauty of the world,
and above all to find true friend-

Your Film Report Card

Keke Marie Antoinette — The
most lavish film ever produced in
Hollywood. It is superb, this mag-
nificent effort to make you happy,
if weepingly sentimental over the
young Queen of France who lost
her head in 1793. Tyrone Power be-
ing her lover.

The result is the story of a Hol-
lywood queen rather than France’s
poor, unhappy queen. The cast did
all they could to overeeme the
weakness of the script.

A truly great story in spite of its
diversion from true history an@ de-
serves well three stars.

decided is whether the yells were

In the Groove

By TOM PERRIN

\ fi
TANK ... This year’s Court of
Control gets the chance to sink
its teeth into the case of the painted
water tank at last. We're hoping
they prove better detectives than
the last body of freshman rulers.
But of course the jobs were com-
plicated last year by the fact that
freshmen had no part in them—at

least that is the story our spies
bring us. Our men tell us more,
too; but that is in the province

of Super Stupor, and we want no
part of it. -

BRUSH ... Incidentally, there
was a perfectly good reason why
the “42” was so poorly painted.
The artists were inexperienced
enough to use a paint brush about
one inch wide, which a little
small for six foot letters. We have
a pretty good idea of the size of
the brush, for the good reason
that it was in our possession. It
was picked up ‘at the site of the
crime late Monday. We turned it
over to the Court yesterday.

IN STEP ... Somebody called
our attention to a little irregular-
ity at the Erskine game; and just
in case you didn’t notice, we'll do
the same for you. The college band
marched on the field, you remem-
ber, with really admirable preci-
sion. That is, with one exception.
As far as we could see there wasn’t
a musician on the field in step with
the Professor-Conductor.

PAMPHLETS ..... . Davidson
isn’t exactly the place where you
would expect to find propaganda
pamphlets in our opinion. It is
about as far—_removed.from isms
as any place we can think of. But
just the same the library receives
an occasional booklet or magazine

make a good impression for some-
body. For example, there was an
issue on one of the hall'racks re-

making Germany seem the most
tranquil and friendly of nations.
Some of them are pretty inter-
esting, if you're curious. There is a
little nifty on display now called
“China at War,” frankly published
from the bulletins of the China In-
formation Committee of Hankow.
If you read it you will probably
finish a little sad at the plight of
the humble Japanese who find
themselves fighting a whole na-
tion of unconquerable heroes.
RUMPLE ... If you have been
in Rumple lately, you have no
doubt noticed a good sized bulle-
tin posted by the phone in the
western~-halfs—-It calls itself the
“Official Hall Directory.” Obviously
it is the work of somebody on the

|

hall, and it manages to have every-
body’s name appear on it several
times, cither as head of something
or other, or assistant to a depart-
ment, or an agent for somebody’s
goods. Also included are such cam-
Pus centers as the residences of the
Pandemonium Council and the
Beleaguered Yanks
