the freshman pre-gaming session
was kicking into full swing, Ben

Gunn was inwardly shocked by
this intimation of forthcoming
mutiny, but continuéd slamming
shots of coconut rum with his hall-
mates as though nothing had hap-
pened.

Shortly before midnight, the
crew drifted down to the Fiji
Islander party. Once there, a fully
sloshed Gunn found himself
stranded in conversation with
Amber Goodman, widely regarded
as the worst conversationalist at
Davidson College.

Gunn spent much of the next
three hours searching for water and
talking to a volleyball. At 2:33 p.m.
he was finally rescued by the S.S.

A standard-sized room on Duke’s
new Aristocratic Hall

No longer will you be forced to
cohabitate with the uncouth,
unwashed masses. According to
the Davidson College Resident
Life Office, students of acceptable
lineage and upbringing with be eli-
gible for the new Upper Crust Hall
on the third floor of Duke
Dormitory.

The hall's Rococo lounge will be

modeled after Versailles’ Chateau -

Neuf, featuring a hall of mirrors,
two marble terraces, and a sunken
octagonal tub.

Students of new money, mer-
chant or artisan backgrounds will
be eligible for the Bourgeoisie Hall
directly below. The hall will be
modeled on Levittown, America,

These bland conformists are shoe-

Anyone wishing to live in Duke
who is unqualified for either of the
aforementioned halls will be con-
fined to the dingy Proletariat Hall
of the first floor. These disenfran-
chised bastards will live three-to-a-
room and work 12-hour days.

Walls will actually be cardboard

partitions and plumbing cannot. be
guaranteed.

From here on out the rabble will
be kept in the basement

THE WEDNESDAY BOOK REVIEW

The J Board, by John Grisham
436 pp. Doubleday. $27.95

Departing from his standard
backdrop of corporate corruption
and powerful D.C. litigators, John
Grisham presents us with a riveting
look at” what is arguably
Davidson’s second most powerful
student-run judicial body.

vt, Firat dace C4

The story centers on Hank
Paxton, the brash, suave president

of Sigma Pi Epsilon who may or’

may not have forced his pledges to
consume, inhumane quantities of
cheesecake during their new mem-
ber education.

When a pledge goes to the infir-
mary with an upset stomach,

Cancer Patients Bench
Press for Phi Delt

Several cancer patients gathered

outside Chambers last Wednesday
to bench press for those afflicted

with the meaty, testosterone-
induced disease known as Phi Delt
Syndrome.

“Mostly we’re just trying to raise
awareness about Phi Delt
Syndrome,” said the patient. “I’d
just really encourage all guys to
visit their doctors and see if they’re
at risk of becoming a Phi Delt.”

There is no known cure.

t BWeek

Paxton faces lawsuits from parents,
The Cheesecake Factory’s raven-
ous corporate litigators, and the
school’s private counsel, a roguish
country clubber with an indiscreet
daughter and a few skeletons in his
closet.

For Hank’s defense, enter Skip
Kingsley, a down-at-the-heels pri-
vate-practice lawyer with a pen:
chant for Jim Beam and a tendency
to blow the few cases that drift his
way.

With the plaintiffs lusting aftera
large out-of-court settlement and
Kingsley resolutely campaigning
for a just trial, the case can only be
headed in one direction: the
school’s nebulous yet omnipotent J
Board.

I wouldn’t be giving away any-
thing to tell you that the trial is rife
with double standards, petty moral-
izing and blackmail. It also fea-
tures a subpoenaed cook and a love
rhombus that will knock your
socks off.

“The J Board” may not be as
deftly penned, as Tom Wolfe’s
scathing portrayal of liberal arts
academia, “Bonfire of the
Humanities,” but the tight plotting
and cliffhanger endings will leave
you longing for Grisham’s next
projects, “The E Board” and “The
PCC,” slated for release next fall.

Jason Mraz Actually
Andy Kifer

In a shocking revelation last
Thursday, the eclectic Virginia-
born singer-songwriter formerly
known as Jason Mraz announced
that he is none other than Davidson
senior Andy Kifer.

“The flannel, the patchy beard,
the lack of vocal range--this just
explains so much,” said freshman
Johnathon Springfield.

Kifer is still confident that his
fan base will turn out for the Pulit
Suprises’s next show.
