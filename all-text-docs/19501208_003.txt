The Community's Reaction

Christian Ideals Brought
To Life Through Gift Fund

By HENRY HANSEN

Last year most of us became aware
of the fact that the town of David.
son consisted of more than Cham.
bers, well-kept homes and «4 busi-
ness district with a patchy Victor-
jan facade. Pouring out of the
Presbyterian church in response to
the fire alarm, the minister, Dr.
Cart Pritchett; and the congregation
discovered a fire in a little two.
room house in Brady's Alley. But
they also discovered a scene of such
squalor, such filth, such a shocking
kind ‘of reality that Erskine Cald-
well himself, able as he is at de-
lineating such nauseous conditions,
might have found it hard to portray
accurately what the congregation
and their minister found there that
Sunday morning. They found cighty-
seven people living in eleven houses.
Alt were terribly crowded, some
with as many as seventeen in three
rooms. The house that burned was
in an indescribably bad state of re-
pair, Tilting crazily; unpainted;
ruinous brick chimney; cracks open
to the wind; without water or
toilet facilities; “insulated” with
newspapers and cardboard; it and
many of the other houses were
such places as we wouldn't think
of using for dog kennels. This was
what they found. This was the
other half of Davidson, the half
which offered a biting rebuke to
the prettier side, the side which was
building a temple to God's glory
whose spire would cast a shadow
on something Jesus would never
have tolerated for a moment; the
half out of which we expect Chris-
tian piety to arise miraculously
from an environment the wonder
of which is that it has not produced
more evil and depravity than it has.

Citizens React

Most of this we know alre sdy.
Perhaps fewer of us are awa ¢ of
what has been done to remedy chese
conditiens. Much has been accom-
plished. Soon after the fire a com-

which pledged this year's Gift
Fund to the work, pledged private
funds for the purchase of govern-
ment bonds which were to be ad-
ditional security to the first mort-
gages held by the bank. Since that
time ten houses have been built
with these. loan funds; two were
built privately by Dr. George B.
Watts of the Davidson College
faculty, the rest by the housing
committee. Changés in local ordin-
ances have resulted in water and
sewerage linc extensions to which
all the houses in Brady’s Alley are
now connected, as well as other
parts of the town which formerly
had not such service. Definite pro-
gress has been made. However, that
much remains to be done need
hardly be said.
Gift Fund Only Part

But there is another fact which
is not so evident. By whom was
all this done? By the townspeople
of Davidson acting both individually
and as a body. The College as an
institution has done nothing (with
the exception of three houses pur-
chased from Miss Hattie Thomp-
son, two of which are being re.
modeled and the erection of one
other house), Except that we have
pledged our Gift Fund, the same
may be said of the student body,
This year’s Gift Fund drive will
offer us the opportunity to extend
the work which has been done
here. It is more than probable that
‘we will reach our goal for we have
always been generous with our
money. Occasionally, however, it
is true that the giving of material
means is one way of ignoring the
deeper responsibility which should
be ours.

How many of us live in towns
with Brady's Alleys? Most of us
do, Therefore to subscribe five dol-
lars is not all that we can or
should do. It may be enough here

POPLIN ELAR APOE LES ADIN,

those Brady's Alleys at home? To
refuse to accept the responsibility
at home is t» make a mockery of
part of the concept of Christianity,
td make only nominal the applica-
tion of the name, Christian, to our-
selves. We have a duty at home
which is not dissolved by participa-
tion in the Gift Fund drive here,

Beyond this, what can the school
do? That it could do a great deal
more is evident. What the towns-
people have done so far has not
been alms giving. The whole pro-
ject has been accomplished on a
sound business basis. No money has
been given outright and all that
has been loaned will bear the usual
interest.

College Challenged

There is another little district
nearby almost’ as bad as Brady’s
Alley. Its name is Shearer Town.
It sounds familiar. Shearer Hall
bears the name of the same man.
John B, Shearer was a president
of this College. He built many of
the houses in Shearer Town
Strange that a slum should bear
the name of a president of David-
son. But no stranger than that
Davidson College has largely ig-
nored
Brady's Alleys through the years.

Tt would not be accurate to say
that the College as an institution

thas done nothing. But Davidson

College is a symbol both to its
students and to many others un-
known to us. Its symbolic signifi.
cance as a Christian institution
makes its responsibility even great-
er than would be the case were
it not a church-related school. That
it has largely ignored its duty here
has resulted in more than a ne.
gation of Christian principles on an
institutional basis. For disparity be-
tween what we preach and what
we do as regards our Brady’s Alleys
cannot but weaken the concept of
Christianity itself both in the stu-
dents and in those countless others
whom we unknowingly influence.

Thus the students must do more
than give five dollars; the college
must do more than it has done.
The students have homes which
have Brady's Alleys and while they
exist we cannot rest until we have
done our share in eradicating them.
And the College, too, must act
as well as speak in Christian ways,
not only to help better a frightful
condition but also to ensure that
no one, student or outsider, look.
ing at the College can say, “If that’s
the Christian way, then I want none
of it.”

would not meet even “the most
primitive of health standards.”

A dangerous fire menace was il-
lustrated at this meeting in that
paper-lined flues, tingler-like walls,
and waste-clotted yards if once ig-
nited, could virtually raze David-
son's business section. These same
conditions were found to have upped
fire insurance rates on all adjacent
establishments.

Still another trouble spot is Shear-
er Town, a group of huts construct-
ed by a one-time president of Da.
uidson College. Here, as in Brady’s
Alley, water is obtained from out-
side spigots which often freeze in
winter. When such a freezing oc-
curs, Shearer Town Negroes are
forced to endure a 100-yard journey
across railroad tracks and a state
highway to the nearest water,
Shearer ‘Town is reputed to be the
center of an intensive Negro crime
wave. This community is located
outside the political jurisdictions
of both Davidson and Mecklenburg
County.

Fire Brings Public Attention

Brought before the public’s eye
in February, 1950, by a flash fire
which gutted John Lowery's home,
Brady's Alley was inwmediately
acted upon by Dr. Cart Pritchett
of Davidson College’s Presbyter-
ian Church. He issued a call for
instant material. aid to Jowery’s
family and proceeded further to
investigate the alley.

Soon after this Dr. Pritchert
called a town meeting in order to
plan for a solution of thé exist-
ing housing and sanitation problem.
Five men of varying experience in

‘fields such as banking, electricity,

plumbing, and the like were named
to a citizen's housing committee.
‘They were instructed to make a
thorough study of this problem in
order to draft a plan of immediate
action,. The men were F. W.
Fredrickson, J. F. Pinckney, Thom.
as Sadler, J. V. Lore, William
Withers and J. F. Hartness.

Building Loan Plan Developed

A plan was then submitted where.
in building loans could be arranged
for those Negroes financially able
to maintain extended payments.
Land was purchased by the com-
mittee in Davidson's Mock Hill
district and work begun on new
homes, Each home averaged a cost
of $2700 of which cost 60 percent
could be lent by the Viedmon
Bank and Trust Company. A re
quired 10 percent was furnished b:
the future homeowners themselves
and the “Y" Gift Fund will insure
20 percent in the form of govern
ment bonds. After the amount owec
on these loans decreases to the
value of the home itself, this Gif
Fund moncy will be reverted te
the YMCA for further use amons
Davidson's Negroes.

Ten four and five room homes
have heen erected in Davidson
Mock Hill district under the pres.
ent housing plan. Two of these
were built by Dr. Watts, .Frencl
professor at Davidson College, and
have been sold by him. Featuring
modern interior furhishings, they
are complete with plumbing, lights,
water and heat. No more do their
owners share the lament of a fam-
ily still in Brady’s Alley who com.
plained, “It looks like the white
folks don’t care whether we live

[Brady's Alley Is Microcosm
Of South's Housing Problem

By J. BRUCE FRYE
The students of Davidson Col.
lege are becoming aware of the
problem that exists in the town’s
slum areas of Brady's, Alley and
Shearer Town, but it) should be

pointed out that these areas are,

not distinctive to Davidson, Every
town and city in the South, and to
an extent every community in the
nation, has it's “Brady's Alley” or
“Shearer Town,” that exists, liter-
ally, under the noses of an appar-
ently unconcerned body of citizens.

To consider the Negro housing
situation of the South in areas ap-
proximately the size of Davidson
is the purpose of this article.

(All statistics are used from the
1940 census.)

Davidson Typifies 20 Percent

Of the 9,904,619 Negroes in the
South, 1,866,909 live in towns ap-
proximately the size of Davidson
To house these people there are
473, 894 dwelling units, of which
65.9 percent are tenant occupied.

These dwelling units have a me-
dian number of rooms of 3.13, and
the mean number of people living
in each dwelling is 3.94, This is an
average of a. little better than one
person to a room.

The extreme crowded conditions
that exist in Brady's Alley are not
entirely consistent with these sta-
tistics, but in all statistics there are
extreme cases, and these certainly
should be mentioned.

Originally, one home, on the
Alley had thirteen people living in
a three-room house. When the
Lowry dwelling burned down, the
four members of that family were

like pigs or not.”

Each of the new homeowners
jas been carefully screened as to
his ability to meet the plari’s re-
quirements, This was done to keep
all arrangements on a_ business
level without involving charity or
outside assistance.

Our Eyes Have Been
Shut, Writes Lingle

DR. W. L. LINGLE

Many of us had walked by that
Mey every day, but we had neve:
ealized the conditions. You know
ome of us go through the world
ooking at everything and seeing
1othing. Now don't go to shaking
our heads at the town of David.
on until yow have looked at the
iving conditions in your own com.
nunity. If you have eyes to see and
vearts to feel, you will probably
find similar conditions, or worse.

1 am reminded of a letter that I
received forty years ago... , from
he late Dr. A. J. McKelway ...

‘n connection With a course in Chris- |,

ian sociology which I was to teach
t Union Seminary in Richmond:
“I might even hazard the sugges-
tion that it would do more for the
Kingdom for the young theologian
to know something about the hous-
ing conditions of the Richmondites

than to be. intimately acquainted |”

with the family life of the Hittites;
the Richmondites being still alive,
and the Hittites having been a
long time dead,”

forced to move into this house in-
creasing the number to seventeen,
Incidents such as this are to be
taken into consideration in the prob-
lem of overcrowding, because they
are bound to happen as long as
these dwellings remain in’ their
present state of disrepair. These
dwellings are beyond the stage
where repair would provide the
ithabitants with a wholesome home
life. The only solution is for new
homes to be built.

In the matter vf necessary utili.
ties to be found in the home, 416.-
000 of the dwelling units, of South.
ern Negros living in areas com-
‘parable in size to Davidson, have
no running water or indoor toilet fa-
cilities, Consider the case of, Shear-
er Town in this light; the nine hous.
es are serviced by one outdoor spi-
got, and all the houses have out-
door privies.

Electricity is a Luxury

Of these dwelling units, only 104,-
000 are lighted by electricity. Con-
sider the case of the Negro girl
from Brady's Alley who received a
record player from an out-of-town
relative for Christmas, two years
ago, and has been unable to oper-
ate it because there was no clec-
trical wiring system in the house.
It would cost $64 just to have the
house wired. This amount is equi-
valent to over eight month's rent
on the house.

Of these units, 303,94 have no
refrigeration, the lack of which is
a source of disease.

These are a few of the statistics
that show’ the general conditions
of Negro housing in the South, as
a whole, as projected in the light
of the situation as it exists in Da.
vidson.

The primary purpose of the
YMCA Christmas Gift Fund is to
improve the hotsing situation of
the Negro in Davidson. Over and
above that, Davidson hopes to pave
the way for other towns and com-

a td
K\s

munities faced with similar condi-
tions, and certainly there are many,
to improve their lot,

For this to be a success, every
student must do his part, and in
some instances more than his part.
This should not be a problem for
Christian students who should be
willing to make self-sacrifices in
order to help theic fellow-man in
need.

Our Termite Thinking
Menaces Democracy

Reprinted from the “Preaby-
terian Outlook,” March 27, 1950.
These findings. from “Church and

Community in the South,” might
well, be considered alongside the
Davidson story:

“Conditions of decay and over-
crowding spell out the same sorry
facts: high rates of disease, de.
linquency, and death for children —
and adults. Negroes, foreigners, ~
ahd the poor generally get the worst
of it as others get the best,

“Housing ties in conerctely with
much of the virtuous and vicious
in our culture’... Tt calls for the
best that people of goodwill have
to give in terms gf reconstruction.
This means reconstruction of think-
ing as well as action. We suffer’
greatly from a_ termite type of.
thinking and action that threatens
the very foundations of democra-

oo

cy.

From our point of view,
(these conditions) combine to make

a crude demonstration of Chris-
tian concern, or the lack .of it, on
the part of so-called respectable
Christian citizens of our communi-
ties—until they get a shock which
reveals to thenv that even on the
level of self-interest and their own
welfare, this sort of thing won't
do,
