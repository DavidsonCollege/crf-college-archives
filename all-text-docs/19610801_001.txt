CAROLINA CULFURE

we are oftcn quick to condcmn
North Carolina as 6 culturul descrt
but a look around us is proof of
the opposite, The summer is tix
scsson for theatre and Charlotte
is not the only ploce to go in
scarch of entertainment.

The summer theatre in the west-
ern port of the state is a must for
anyone who is génuinely intcrested
in drama and above avcrage cnter-
teinment.

All this is brought on by the
editor's introduction to arena the-
atreé this orst weekcnd. The Silo
Circle Pleyhouse was the site of
this introduction, and THE SEVEN
YE»R ITCK wes the vchicle,

we were surprised at the num-
ber of Davidson students that we
mct there, and plcased at their re-
action to the Silo. It secms that
one has to sec arena theatre only
once, and he is hooked,

But, after onc performance, we
felt that it was not only arena
theatrc thet was unique; the Silo
ecest and staff has a spirit that is
catching.

These are pros. from New York,
yct they ‘arc not the "fat cats"
that steff so many summer theatres,
.c got the fecling that this was a
cast that meosured its success in
repport with the audience, not in
box office receints,

If ever @ Saturday rolls around
and you héve nothing to do, I recom-
mend the eight o'clock performance
of the Silo Circlc Playhousc of
Black ji0untain, N.C.
