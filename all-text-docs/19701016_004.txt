End Of Exclusion

In the curious rhetoric which characterises all
trustee actions, Davidson's trustees have neither
abolished nor supported the fraternity system and

It is a sbame that so much

used. in the continuing de- —

have been fully . developed

_ on both sides for years and

yet have initiated a plan which will probably elimin- :

oe the inequities in the present system.

Perhaps most significant in the action is the
assertion that ultimately affiliation with a social group
will be by the choice of the individual and not at the.
whim of local or national exclusive tendencies. We .

that the self selection might be implimented

right away even though mechanics are not yet on -

a definite timetable.
Also of chief importance in the proposals are
the requirements which seem sure to eliminate the
bilities of off campus fraternities. It is quite
rtant that. these restrictions were made.
_ All in all. we must congratulate the trustees on
a good afternoon's work.

Slow Wheels Of Change

Change comes so slowly. to the Davidson campus
that when we committee meetings, pre re-
, referendums, studies, referrals. back to com-
mittee, faculty meetings, ad hoc studies, leaflettted
proposals, editorial endorsements, and midnight dis-
cussions are finished, it is hard to realize that action

has actually touched this college. .
But when that action does occur it should not pass
without notice of.some sort. Such is the case with self-

' scheduled exams.:

A bit of: gratitude. must go ‘o to all those who: finally
pushed and persuaded: the faculty to adopt a program
for trial of self-scheduled exams.

/ Somewhere back in the past of recent Davidson
history. self-scheduled exams were rec as a
worthwhile goal. of student.concern. Nothing. concrete
happened, however, until the proposals became the ad-
aber cause celebre of the stiident yee in the
senate

Through. constant study, proposals, and re
als members of the senate were able to convince, Ros
faculty that a program which they seemed to eschew -

need no further delineation.

What is more, the discus-
sion of the old system, and
the one which will replace
it, divert attention from the
really importamt . question
which now. confronts us:
How are we. to insure the
continuance of Davidson as

a social community in the |

face of a growing’ segmenta-
tion of the student body?

The ‘key ‘word in the re-’”

cent changes within the col-
lege is community: In’ its

name the Code of ‘Responsibi- -

lity was substituted for a
more bulky set of rules. In
its name we bid fraternities
farewell.

Yet, for all the talk of
community which permeates

_ our official statements, there

is little reason to. suppose

_ that the changes which have

taken place over. the last

four years, and those. which |

oe

will taket place over the
next four, will do anything
to further. our progress to-

ward this goal.

In fact, there is more rea-

_ son to suppose that it will

' set us back.

for -all its drawbacks, the
Davidson which presented
itself to thé freshman of
four years ago had a num-
ber of mechanisms which

munity together.

sory chapel insured that,

Community was in the same

we faced it together.

Yet, this kind of program

would tend to segment,

rather than unite, the col-

lege community. It would
center the attention of the
student in his particular re-
sidential unit, rather than
widening the scope of his
acquaintances.

many upperclassmen would
a freshman have occasion to

sure.

One of .the obvious: advan-
tages which a small school
has to offer is a closer sense
of community. than is pre-
semt at bigger, more imper-
sonal universities. :

Without: careful consider: .
ation of the implications of
future changes in. the social
system here, we may throw
away this advantage by un-

But no matter how I tried,
I couldn't even make it

During dinner, I told her
about the wonderful plans
for. the weekend including
the skydiver, cardshark,
Mark Twain impressionist,
the First Edition, and every-
thing.

But she still couldn't fat-’

hom it all,

She kept. asking, ‘‘Why?”’
and I just didn’t know how
to answer.

“Why have these extrava-

Zanzas you call Big Week-

“Female companionship
for all us socially starved
plebes,”’ I promptly plead-
ed, adding that it gives
good excuses to invite af-

of the earth.

I was sure that would con-

‘vince her, but she was ‘un-
