THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

- FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 14, 1958

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

Query: Is Davidson Man “Beat,”
“Organized” --- Or Indifferent?

To every college generation falls
the duty of deciding how it shall be
remembered.

For a while it seemed that there
was. little doubt that we were to be
rather easily catalogued as the ‘se-
curity maniacs” or the silent genera-
tion.

William Whyte. in his Organiza-
tion Man, found the American college
graduate fitting into the industrial
and corporate maze with jlacrity and
ease because he had been educated
by his college society to be a con-
formist — educated to be the “‘or-
ganization man.”

This hypothesis received substan-
tial support from teachers and col-
lege administrators who wondered. a
bit sadly. why students no more ate
goldfish, joined picket lines. or
steeled themselves with the proverbial
“slim-volume"” of free-thinking verse.
All agreed that apathy and conformity
seemed to be in the saddle.

This neat classification of Ameri-
can youth was broadened, if not up-
set, by the advent of Jack Kerouac.
“The San Francisco School”; and the
accompanying herd of ‘beat’ intel-
lectuals. This cultural movement ar-
rived. typically enough. on motorcy-
cles. sporting ‘‘blessed oblivion"
stamped on the bumper.

The eccentricities of this group
can be dismissed as part.of the ever
present crop of sociat misfits. The
restlessness of the movement. the as-
peet of fitful search for something un-
known, cannot be. and has not been.
so easily dismissed from the social
consciousness.

In recent months some long second
thoughts concerning American col-

_lege students have brought to light

the fact that, though not exactly
“beat,” the restlessness, nervousness
and escapism of college people is
not too far from the actions of some
Kerouac’s characters, considered from
the viewpoint of motivation.

Our epithet is not so clearly fixed
as it once was.

Somewhere in this maze of con-
flicting forces and ideas stands the
Davidson student. None of the gen-
eralizations exactly apply in his case,
just as they fail to match any special
situation.

For several years, student writers
and caffeine philosophers have drop-
ped the Davidson student into the
conformity-organization-security mold
with studied ease.

Perhaps they have been right. Cer-
tainly they have been partly fight.
but we wonder if the whole story has
been told.

We are inclined to suspect that
beneath the “ivy league’ exterior of
the Davidsonian lies more than just a
bit of “beatness."” Perhaps the whole
truth will never be exactly known,
but it’s worth some careful thought.

In the past. most of the cliches
hurled our way have, originally, come
from people not of our generation.
It seems that the time has come for
us to pick our own, or, better still,
seriously examine the significance and
truth of those proposed for the Class-
es of 1955-65

This problem is especially pertinent
at Davidson, where we are too prone
to: follow blithe ways, rarely consider-
the question. “Just what are we?”

Perhaps someday the question will
bé seriously asked and sincerely. ans-
wered. The. results might be quite
surprising to all concerned.

Race For Coffee

KERNAN

A murmur of voices woke me, signifying that chapel
was over: I followed the rest of the herd to the house

that Ovens built. Evidently

I hadn't run the good race,

for my request for coffee was answered by an imperious
stare and the announcement that I would have to re.
strain ‘myself until more coffee was brewed. I have at-
tempted to interpret this incident through the eyes of
some of literature's better known writers.

Ernest Hemingway, for example—Death in the Morn-

.
ing.

Chapel was over; the speaker had shot the bull. It
was a clean kill. I thought he did it very well. Sometimes
they take too long; then they get nervous and make a
bad job of it. I was glad he had done a good job, though;
it’s better that way. I walked to the Union; the rain was
very cold. “I will die if I don’t drink some coffee," |

thought.

“I would like some coffee,” I said to the Barmaid.

“Lam sorry,” she said, “but we have no coffee. There
will be some later, maybe. Is there anything I can do?”

“It is all right,” I said. ‘It doesn’t matter.” I lelt the
Union and walked all the way back to my dormitory in

the rain.

Or perhaps Sophocles — Kernanipus the Thirsty.

Kernanipus: Alas, alas, woe, woe, Great Bacchus hath
deserted me! Would that Poseidon, with all his mighty
waters, could soothe my parching throat. O Exalted Apollo,
heed my plea (learnt at the shrine of Labban) and
quench my thirst with nectar.

The Furies: (Disguised as a fleet of Slater Barmaids)
Alas, alas, woe, woe, thou hast come too late; nevermore
Shall flow this ebony stream. Our cups have overflowed,

Or Thomas Wolfe—Of Time and the Coffee
A stone, a leaf, and unfilled cup—O Lost! He leaned

forward on the counter, his

gigantic bulk towering over

the other men at the bar, but not caring for their stares

and whispers, he savagely

pounded his fist on the

enameled surface and roared for coffee.
“We're out,” said the Barmaid. “Ya got to come back

later.”’

He struggled blindly for the door, a wild goat-cry
torn from his lips, as he staggered out into the millioned-

voice night. O Lost!

On Filling The

Personal Vacuum

By DABNEY STUART

“If we do not make of God’s
death a great renunciation over

a fairly liberal stand on social and
economic issues, divorcing them-
selves from the policies of the na-
tional Republican Party.

An even greater liability than the
unpopularity of its policies was the
GOP’s lack of a reserve of capable
leaders. who could win voters to the
Republican position. With the excep-

The contemporary individual

the torch of his individual right

portant part in the Democratie vic-
‘tory, it seems hard to deny that the
people of the United States clearly,
expressed their dissatisfaction with
the Republican party, at both a state-
wide and a national level. and wath
reference to personalities as well as
matters of policy.

Although irrelevant issues were
used by both sides, (someone has re-
marked that Sherman Adams seemed
to be running against Walter Reuther
in nearly every district), the. election
as a whole’ was decided on the quest-
ion of whether the Republican Party
could put forth a social and economic
program acceptable to a majority of
{he voters, and whether it could sup-
ply the kind of leadership required
to put it into effect. And on both of
these points the Republicans decisive-
ly Jost at the polls.

Not even the veneration auto-
matically accorded to President Eisen-
hower could persuade the public to
accept his denunciation of the ‘“radi-
cal spenders” among liberal Demo-
crats. The so-called “right-to-work”
laws defeated Republican candidates
in five of the six states where they
were proposed, retiring such promi-
nent Republicans as Senator Bricker
of Ohio and Senator Knowland of
California.

That this was a general victory of
liberals and moderates over conserva-
tives is shown by the fact that a few
Republican candidates — such as Nel-
son Rockefeller in New York and
Hugh Scott in Pennsylvania — won
against strong Democrats by taking

tion of a very few men, the Republi-
cans had no one to compare with such
rising Democrats as Engle in Cali-
fornia, AlcCarthy in Minnesota. arid
Proxmire in Wisconsin — all new-
comers to the national scene.

The election naturally casts a
shadow over Republican prospects in
1960. but a more important question
arises: what is the future of a party
whose policies are obsolete and whose
leadership is stagnant?—C.H.C.

Score One For
Student Body

We were gratified by the response
of the Student Body in Tuesday’s vote
on the ‘Firearms Amendment”,

Such action by the Student Body
to create, with the help of its elected
representatives, a regulation for the’
benefit of the entire campus goes a
long way to bear out our belief that
good student government is far and
away the best discipline or mode of
regulation that a college campts can
have.

President Kuykendall and_ his
Council should be congratulated for
their part in the undertaking. The
brand of leadership which they have
displayed in recent weeks has been
a pleasant change from past experi-
ence.

We beg to make one suggestion.
For next Tuesday's Honor Court vote,
let’s make the ballots more under-
standable. This week’s effort required
quite a bit of explanation.

to be learned from the speech
of even a poor speaker about
the nature of polities.

KERNAN‘S COLUMN

There is an attitude at David-
son that in order to be truly
sophisticated, one must scoff at
such “Mickey Mouse" activities
as extra-curricular —_ lectures,
honest intellectualism. or en-
thusiasm about anything. Mr.
Kernan’s column reflects this
attitude. It is a fact, granted,
and is recognized by any soul
who ever takes time to think.
But it is certainly not sophisti-
cated.

True sophistication includes
an awareness of what is going
on beyond the bounds of Da.
vidson College and back home
at Nowhere, North Carolina.

It is knowing that when most
people refer to “the hill” they
mean Capitol Hill and not Da-
vidson. The Great Issues pro-
gram was an effort to instill a
little of this real sophistication
in the — pseudo-sophisticated.,
Naive and narrow Davidson gen-
tleman.

heart. they are troubled at not
having more light, let them not
disguise the f[aet; this avowal
will not be shameful. The only
shame. is to have none. Nothing
reveals more an extreme weak-
ness of mind than not to know
the misery of a Godless man.
Nothing is morc indicative of a
bad disposition than not to de-
sire the truth of  cternal
promises. Nothing is more
dastardly than to act with bra-
vado before God.

“Let them at least be honest
men, if they cannot be Christi-
ans. Finally, let them recog-
nize that there are two kinds
of people one can call reasona-
ble; those who serve God with.
all their heart because they
know Him, and those who seek
Him with all their heart be-
cause they do not know him.”
