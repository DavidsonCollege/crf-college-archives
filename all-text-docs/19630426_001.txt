NUMBER TWENTY-FOUR

DRAMA NOT THE ISSUE

Display Questions Role

Of Liberal Arts Institution)

“Drama is only a segment of a larger problem: the role of the arts in a Liberal
Arts College.” These words are written ona bulletin board in the Cunningham Fine
a bulletin board that has become a magnet which is pulling in
from the town as well as students from the college to examine a display set up

Arts Center,

William F. Goodykoontz.

On a wall in the classroom be-
hind the Stowe Galleries, a cen-
tral theme stands out in Goody-
koontz’s display—that there is a
gap between the public image
of Davidson College and the ac-
tual fact of where it stands in
giving precedent to the tiberal
arts. “The bulletin board dis-
play,” Goodykoontz says, “is an
attempt to present to anyone in-
terested the spectacular ex-
amples of the image-fact gap.”

On the wall Goodykoontz has
assembled many statements by
the college administration on
the goals Davidson is striving
toward, and he has tried to
prove that the public image thus
created is not in accord with
actual practice here by citing
various instances from the long-
embroiled drama program con-
troversy.

And while he indicates his
efforts stem from his frustra-
tion in his attempt to develop
what he considers to be a de-
sirable drama program here,
much more than drama is ind-
cluded.

He contends that drama is
not his sole concern: “Anyone
who looks more closely will
be struck at once, | think, by
perhaps the most immediate-
ly serious of all our problems
(because it creates compla-
cency and makes necessary
changes more difficult): the
widening gap between the
DAVIDSON IMAGE and the
DAVIDSON REALITY.”

Goodykoontz's investigation
into creative fields other than
drama may prove interesting to
students. For instance, Goody-
koontz has essembled on a table
different creative magazines
and publications from other in-
stitutions such as Wake Forest,
Georgetown University, the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, and
Hollins College. Even some high
schoo! publications are includ-

A college employee told Kays
Gary of the Charlotte Observer,
“Well, I can tell you one thing.
He could have done better than
that."’

Gary replied to that in his
column in three words that have
become rather well-known: “Oh,

Goodykoontz also brings out
the fact that Davidson abol-
ished Senior Class Day in
1961 following two speeches
and just this year the IFC
abolished the skits as a part
of Greek Week.

He states that he has made
these points about the college
in the desire “to stimulate
thought and discussion about
specific issues, with the hope
that out of such thought and
discussion gain may be
made towards making Davidson
a better liberal arts college.”

board is the magazine Think,
which is published by IBM.

The magazine, which is de-
voted almost exclusively to
the subject of creativity,
sums up the creative man as
one who is critical, asks the
“wrong” questions, has a
highly - developed asthetic
sense, who participates, not
being passive about issues,
who needs freedom to devel-
op, and is instinctive and in-
dividualistic.

Goodykoontz asks one particu-

lar question of Davidson with]

his controversial bulletin board:
Is this school really helping to
build creativity among its stud-
ents? Goodykoontz also suggests
an answer to the question, a
negative answer.

But the final judge of that
answer must be each observer
who examines Goodykoontz’s
work

Executive Weekend

J. Robert Sailstad, director of this year’s Executive
Week-end, has announced that 40 leading businessmen in
professional and civic fields will be at Davidson Friday

and Saturday, May 3-4.

Their schedule for the week-
end includes three lectures, dis-
cussion groups, recreational re-
laxation, and special luncheons.
These are designed as a combin-
ation of activities that will pro-
vide intellectual stimulation and
study in those areas outside
each man’s vocational specializa-
tion. ae

The college's planning com-
mittee for the Executive Week-
End has selected four widely
diversified subjects as the top-
ics for the four separate discus-
sion groups. These study pro-
grams will be led by Davidson
professors Drs. William B.
Hight, William T, Lammers, Joe

: idson's endeavor to make

of Embry’'s talks. Each of the
participants in his group will
receive as subject sources The
Stranger by Camus and The
Existentialist Posture by Shinn.

Richard Butwell’s Southeast
Asia Today and Tomorrow is
one of the background texts that
Marrotte, associate professor of
history, will use in discussing
“The American Dilemma in
Southeast Asia.”

Each executive may attend
one or more of these lecture-
discussion sessions. All neces-
sary reference sources that will
accompany each individual talk
will be provided for the execu-
tives by the college.

The entire conference is
modeled on a similar affair
sponsored by the Aspen insti-
tute, Aspen, Colo. That par-
ticular event was held for
three weeks and was centered
on academic endeavors.

Week-End will be in the Cun-

ing to be held in the band room.

Burts Gives News
On Holiday Hooky

BY BILL LOGAN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Dean of Students Richard C. Burts released figures
this week on absences before and after holidays, as com-
piled from reports of the faculty.

The Dean's Office distributed
a memorandum to the faculty
on March 5 im order to make a
comparison of last year's (1961-
62) total class absences before
and after Thanksgiving and
Christmas recess with this year’s
(1962-63).

Of the 80 memoranda distri-
buted, only 48 have been re-
turned. Of these 48 faculty mem-
bers reporting, 25 gave figures
for both last year and this year.

The figures show that nine
percent of the students enrolied
were absent from class during
the two. days before the 1961
Thanksgiving recess and nine
percent were absent during the

j two days before the 1961 Christ:

mas recess.
But under this yeer’s new
cut system, classes two days

absence rates of 19 and 23
percent, respectively.
Absences for the two days
following Thanksgiving recess
decreased from 3.6 percent to
3.0 percent from 1961 to 1962,
but they increased from 3.7 to
4.8 percent for the two days
following Christmas recess.

Last year’s absence system
called for double cuts to be
given for absences within two
days of a recess. There is no
such provision this year.

Despite the increase in ab-
sences, the faculty favors the
present system. The added
freedom around holidays has
not appreciably affected the
overall cutting among stud-
ents.

Among the many

A. G. Griffin, a veteran on the
‘faculty, also supports the sys-
tem. He said, “No cut system is
really satisfactory. I was not in
favor of the old system, and al-
though I'm not happy with this
system, I am willing to continue
it.”

Analyzing the problem of cut-
ting before holidays, Griffin
said, “Ideally, class require.
ments are so stringent that a
student dare not miss class. I
question whether we have the
rigor in our work that we some-
times think we have. I don't re-
gard a class before a holiday as
any less important than any'
other class. I think a professor
is obligated to be serious in cov-
ering material, regardless of the
number of students absent.”
