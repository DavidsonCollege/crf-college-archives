The North Carolina
Alcoholic Beverage Control
Board informed the college
Thursday that present prac-
tices of dispensing beer in the
Union were illegal.

State agents, in a meeting
with College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. and
Director of the Student Union
C. Shaw Smith, indicated that
the college was in violation of
state law through its current
practices of providing free
beer in the Rathskeller of the
College Union.

Because Davidson does not
have a license to sell beer, the
contribution system in the
Union bar, where students are
encouraged to make a con-
tribution for the free beer, is
prohibited by law.

Two ABC Board agents,

Schola:

Davidson College Senior
Pete Kyle of Lubbock, Tex.
has won a Rhodes Scholarship
for two years of study at the
University of Oxford,
England.

The Rhodes award, the 18th
won by a Davidson student, is
considered the most
prestigious scholarship for
graduate study available to
American college students. It
pays virtually all expenses for
two years at Oxford. Kyle
plans to work toward a degree
in mathematics and logic.

Kyle won his scholarship at
the Gulf States district com-
petition in New Orl?ans.
Another Davidson senior,
John M. Douglas Jr. of
Charlotte, was a North
Carolina finalist but did not
win in Southern district com-
petition in Atlanta.

Kyle has achieved a near -
4.00 average while at David-
son and has run cross-country
and track for the college.

During his junior year at the
University of Marburg, Ger-
many, Kyle was named an
assistant to his mathematics
professor, a responsibility
usually reserved for graduate
students. In the 1972-73
natonal Putnam Mathe-
matical Competition, he
ranked among the top three
students in the South. He is
also active in the Episcopal
Church.

On a _ motion passed
through the Faculty
Executive Committee last
week, classes after the
Christmas break will
resume on Tuesday, Jan. 8
and the following Saturday,
Jan. 12 will be observed as
a class day. Classes after the
winter break will resume on
Tuesday, March 5 and Satur-
day, March 9 will be a class
day.

Union Bar Violates

Strict A.B.C. Statutes

having heard in Charlotte that
beer was obtainable at the
Davidson College Union, en-
tered the Rathskeller about
9:30 p.m. on November 16.

After having bought two
cups of beer, they asked how
much they should contribute.
The bartender indicated that
15¢ would be an adequate con-
tribution.

Having this exchange of
money over the bar in return
for ‘‘Free beer’’ convinced the
agents that Davidson was in
violation of the law. The
Schlitz clocks behind the bar,
a gift from a distributor, led
them to believe that the Union
was not getting beer from
authorized retailers, but
direct from the distributor.
This they explained, is illegal.

“We will comply im-
mediately with what the ABC
Board says, and we trust that
fraternities will do the same,”’
said Spencer.‘‘They warned
us that we were unwittingly in
violation of the law. They were
very nice to Davidson, but
they are obviously interested
in seeing that the law is en-
forced properly.”

Assistant Director of the
College Union Duff Bruce in-
dicated that several changes
in policy would be necessary
to insure compliance with the
law.

“If a fraternity had free
beer for a party, but charged
for students to hear the band,
they would be inviolation of
the law,” Bruce explained.

‘When you have free beer,
you have to let everyone in.
For example, a freshman hall
or heating house will not be
able to keep anyone out.”’

Neither students nor towns-
people could be excluded
from such an event, making
the college liable to check for
identifications to establish the
drinking age of the people in-
volved. In addition, brown-

bagging would have to be
more closely supervised, in-
suring that those who checked
liquor were over the 21 age
limit.

‘‘We want to be very sure
we're not in danger of
violating the law. It is not wor-
the damage to the reputa-
tion of the collge to be
slack in our responsibilities
where alcohol is involved,”
said Bruce.

Bruce expressed hope for
obtaining a license to sell beer
in the future.

“If the Trustees give us the
right to seek a beer license, I
think it would simplify
things,”’ he said.

“We're not trying to make
beer a business here. If we did
get a license it would not be a
matter of us making money
from the sale of beer.”’

Spencer did not advocate
seeking a license at this time.

RECRUITMENT PUSH

This year's basketball recruiting expenses are being in-
creased with no official ceiling. The results of the recruitment
program will determine the scope of Davidson basketball in the

future.

Basketball Program Allotted

Increased Recruiting Funds

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

(Ed Note: This is the first in
a series of articles regarding
the future status of basketball
at Davidson College. The
series will focus on the recruit-
ment aspect of Wildcat
basketball. The following in-
stallment deals with the
College’s present policy regar-
ding recruiting.)

With the recent decision by
the Board of Trustees of
Davidson College to restruc-
ture the athletic policies of the
institution, there has been an
increased emphasis on the
future of the basketball
program here.

One of the most important
factors in maintaining a top-

level program in this sport is
recruiting. Thus, the
recruiting element of the
program is now undergoing a
transitional peried.

College President Samuel
Spencer sketched the prin-
ciples which will dictate the
college’s policy towards
recruiting in the coming year.

“It would really have to be
classified as an experimental
year,’’ Spencer stated, ‘‘What
will be done in the future will
depend on the events of this
year as far as_ recruiting
players is concerned.”’

The trustee policy regarding
the basketball program has
been stated as being very con-
cerned and dedicated to main-
taining a program of national

Slater To Implement Price Hikes

By BRUCE CORSER
Managing Editor

Ron Scott, Director of
ARA Slater Food Service, has
indicated that he will enact a
series of proposed alterations
in the Davidson Dining Ser-
vice in order to off-set in-
flationary food prices and the
energy crisis.

The revisions to become ef-
fective immediately following
the Christmas recess, are ex-
pected to compensate for a 22
percent increase in wholesale
food costs since September
1973.

Desserts, vegetable and
potato items and breakfast
foods such as omelets
bacon, seaame ant toast will
cost more upon students’
return in January.

In addition, there will be an
ti ie charge for each

of punch, Pepsi, Teem,
ro Mod Dew, and milk.

However, this elimination of
the ‘‘no limit’ refill policy
doesn't include coffee or tea.

Also, the price of milk is to
be hiked to 20 cents per
glass, up from 15 cents.

Scott revealed that hen-
ceforth Bailey House will
close on Saturday, except
during special weekends when
business will merit opening.
During weekdays, the price of
a complete dinner at Bailey
will be raised 10 cents. The
dinner will still include one
each of salad, vegetable,
potato, roll and oleo pattie,
though

This increase will not af-
fect the special line sandwich
prices featured at lunch in
Bailey, Scott noted.

Until now, Slater has been
experiencing a 5-6 percent in-
crease over projected food
costs. The up-coming in-
creases should adequately

compensate for the deficit.

Scott has been reluctant to
make these changes and said
that he had been “‘holding off
to see how far we could go
with current prices.”’

“Because of our size,” he
continued, ‘‘ the operation
here at Davidson is readily ef-
fected by inflation.”

However, Scott emphasized
that any profit made above the
budgeted profit margin would
be passed along to students in
larger helpings of food or in-
creased service.

“We will also be making
some changes in our menu by
replacing unpopular items
and increasing menu
variety,” he added.

Indicating some concern for
student tastes, Scott con-
cluded, “‘We try to satisfy
stents the best we can with
the amount of money we are
receiving.”

prominence with particular
emphasis on establishing the
team with a_ top-twenty
ranking in the national polls.

Spencer was quick to affirm
the determination and support
of the Trustees and the ad-
ministration in theirallegience
to this type of program.

“Everyone is behind
keeping our basketball
program at the top of the
Southern Conference and con-
tinuing to provide the finan-
cial and material support for a
nationally prominent program
here,” he asserted.

He also pointed out that
there would be a key meeting
on Jan. 9 to discuss the
recruiting policy of the
college for the basketball
program. At this meeting will
be trustee and administration
officials, as well as the
coaches and other athletic
personel .

“This meeting will be the
determination of a set policy
for the coming year as far as
recruiting is concerned, ”

“As yet, there is
established guideline as far as
the recruiting budget goes
for 1973-47.”

The preliminary policy,
which has not met the final ap-
proval of the necessary con-
stiuencies, would give the
program ‘‘unlimited financial
resources, within reason,’’ to
recruit the best possible talent
for future basketball at
Davidson.

Spencer emphasized the
qualification ‘within reason’’.
“It’s very important that we
remember to keep the ex-
penditures within reason,’’
he explained. “This is going
