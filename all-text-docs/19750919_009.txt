WHERE HEROES DARE: Senior Joe Duncan moves between two
Madison Players in a 3-0 loss.

Dukes crush Cat booters

The Davidson soccer team
dropped a 3-0 decision to the
Madison Dukes last Friday in
their opening match for the
1975 season.

Although the Cats failed to
score, the match was much
closer than the final score
indicates. Davidson controlled
the tempo of the game, as the
Cats controlled the ball for 52 of
the game’s 90 minutes.

The Dukes capitalized on a
charging infraction by
Davidson early in the game,
scoring on the direct kick.

The Cats had numerous
scoring opportunities. Joe
Duncan headed several shots

which were stopped by the
Madison goalie and his direct
kick was just wide of the mark.
Billy Hawk chipped a shot that
barely went over the bar, while
the Madison goaltender made a
temendous save of a shot by
Tom Blackwood.

With ten minutes left in the
game, the Cats trailed by only
1-0. The Cats made a costly
error, however, that allowed
the Dukes to increase the
margin.

Fullback Gary Dancigar
kicked the ball toward goalie
Bob Perz. But Perz was not
expecting the pass and let the
ball get by him. Phil Barringer
was alertly backing up the play.
But his clearing kick deflected

_ Mar fi n antici loates

winning season

. By MARK POSTOVE
Staff Writer
The 1975 Davidson cross
country team appears to be one

f of the strongest of recent
# years. The Wildcats, coming off
§ last year’s 9-3 record, will be

facing a tough schedule in
whick they run five of the seven
conference teams.

Coach Sterling Martin feels
that it is one of the strongest
competitive schedules in many
years, and this fact in addition

.to the excellent record of last

year will present a stiff chal-
lenge to the squad.

Leading the team will be
junior co-captain Coty Pinck-
ney, who won the most valu-
able award last season.

“Battling for second will be
freshmen cake race winner
Doug Horn and senior Fred
Borch, much improved after a
year of competition in Eng-
land,” said Martin.

“The loss of number two
runner Bill McClemment will

THE

hurt, but Doug and Fred should
fill his shoes. John Barksdale,
returning after a year’s ab-
sence, will add tremendous
strength to the team, and
senior co-captain Bill Cole, in
the best condition ever, should
be in the top five,” commented
Martin.

Martin is looking to seniors
Jeff Neikirk, Jesse Smith, and
Steve Scroggs to add important
experience and depth to the
team. Sophomores Steve Jus-
tus, Zach Murrell, and Jay
Silver all look good at this point
and will make a significant
contribution this year, accord-
ing to Martin.

Juniors Jim wouglas and
Dave Rainey are running cross
country at Davidson for the
first time and will be joined by
freshmen Ed Anderson (second
place finisher in the cake race),
Bob Sweet, and Chris Frie-
singer.
