Perfect Record

[The Point

DANGER LURKS OUTSIDE

THE SOUTHERN CONFERENCE continued to play
tougher outside competition this year because the aggre-
gate non-conference results of the nine teams was a sad

No team had a winning season outside the league
though West Virginia and William and Mary managed
to break even. Other records range from Davidson’s 5-7
down to George Washington’s lousy 1-10. No wonder
Babe McCarthy quit.

Our own infamous leader, Lefty Driesell, pointed
out recently in a fun-filled assembly that records look a
lot better against teams like New Hampshire, Presby-
terian and Georgia Southern, and that one of the rea-
sons this season’s record was not up to war was the
stiffer outside competition.

Pursuing Lefty’s reasoning further, one can see that
he is right. Among the tougher opponents the 'Cats faced
during the Terry Holland and Fred Hetzel days were
Carson-Newman, Mississippi College, Wofford (twice),
Belmont Abbey and Erskine (twice). These little friends
helped the 1961-62 edition post a 14-11 record. The next
year most of these schools and Jacksonville University
helped post a 20-7 year.

_ ONE OF THE PRICES a school pays when it goes
big time is the loss of opponents who don’t want much
money (and aren’t worth much anyway). Now to get a
breather, you have to play in the conference or else
bring in someone from so far away that their record isn’t
well known. Hence the increase in Coliseum games and
more outside losses.

DEDICATION

IF YOU EVER thought there were too many people
on the floor of the Coliseum during our games there,
you ought to see it during this tournament. Every sports
writer who has a car is here and brought his grand-
mother too. For many of these guys, this is just another
assignment, but there are certainly a bunch here who
are on a busman’s holiday.

But it really does a heart good to look over and
see the publisher-editor-sports editor-business manager
of a small West Virginia weekly paper which went to
press Wednesday taking notes like his wife was holding
the press waiting for his game report . . . next Wednes-

day.

____ Much has been said about poor VMI not participating
in the tournament, but they have only themselves to
blame. With the material they had, the less games they
played the better their chances of winning:

__ THOUGHT FOR THE WEEK: “Prowess in compe-
tition no matter what the sport has always been admired
in men. Athletic competition is an integral part of the
life of any well-rounded institution. Winning is a source
of pride for the students that comes from nowhere else.
For the world outside often knows the school only by
its teams. And this association is important for the stu-
dent, for he will soon be an alumnus who will brag on
the old days.” (Quips and Cranks, 1966) —

Greg Cox in the 60-yard dash.
Lou Hill and Cox in the broad
jump and the triple jump, and
Randy Randolph and Roane

Coach Heath Whittle said he
believes Davidson's best events
will be in the broad jump and

ances by Cox and Cross.

Whittle commented, “I think
William and Mary will win first

Furman. Richmond, ECC and
The Citadel will also participate.

“VMI will have an advantage.

Davidson's outmanned swim-
mers dropped their final meet to
a tough VMI team here Monday,
finishing up with a 1-9 season
record. The finmen managed to
chalk up three first-place fin-
ishes en route to the 67-37 de-
feat.

The brightest spot amid the
gloom for the ‘Cats was Eddie
Beach, who pulled in two first-
place finishes, winning the 200-
yard individual medley and the
200-yard butterfly.

Steve Barden grabbed the oth-
er win in the 200-yard breast
stroke. Also turning in a fine
performance was Joe Friebele,
who finished second in the 50-

yard freestyle and the 200-yard

backstroke.

Commenting on the match,
Coach Tom Stevens remarked,
“VMI is probably the best team
we've faced all year."

Although the Wildcats have
posted only one victory this sea-
son, Stevens feels that the nine-
man team has worked hard and
done well against highly unfav-
orable odds. ‘We always have

‘about four events that we can

only use one man in, automatic-
ally forfeiting at least second
and third place,’"* he comment-
ed.

The swimmers finish up the
season with the Southern Con-
ference meet at Greenville, N.
C. starting Thursday and contin-
uing through the finals Satur-

vored, with West Virginia and

GREENSBORO—The Da-
vidson Wildkittens edged
past a surprisingly tough
N.C. State frosh, 88-80, here

Wednesday to become the :z

first undefeated team in Da- %

vidson basketball history.
The State frosh gave David-

son a rough fight in the first half !

and trailed by only one point,
41-40. at halftime. State then

matched Davidson basket-for- {

basket carly in the second half,
before Jan Postma pumped in

two jump shots to send David-
* son out in front.

The Wolflets were never able
to come within striking distance
of the ‘Kitten lead.

Postma topped the scoring
charts With 29 points, 17 of them
coming in the first half. The 6-5
forward also grabbed nine re.
bounds for the. ‘Kitten cause.

‘Jan did a great job for us,”
said a jubilant Coach Terry
Holland. ‘‘He carried us through-
out the first half when Jerry
(Kroll) was in foul trouble. He
was really hot tonight.” Postma
hit 12 of 20 field goal attempts
and was five for five at the line.

Doug Cook hit 20 points and
garnered 13 rebounds for the
‘Kittens while Kroll scored 13.

Randy Jones scored 11 pojnts,
while Fox Demoisey added nine,

The win gives the ‘Kittens a
16-0 record for the season, mak-
ing them the only major unde-
feated athletic team in David-
son history.

The ‘Kittens rolled to their fif-
teenth win of the year last Sat-
urday night against The Citadel
in Johnston Gym. The ‘Kittens
bombed the Bullpups, 108-78, as
all the bench played.

Cook led Davidson with 27
points against The Citadel. Kroll
followed with 25 points while
Postma added 22. The ‘Kittens’
withering scoring barrage biast-
ed The Citadel from the begin-
ning of the game and held them
in check throughout the night.

Leading the Bullpups was for-
ward Willie Taylor, who pumped
in 36 points for the losers’ cause.
The Citadel played without the
services of two starters from
the team which gave the ‘Kit-
tens a rough fight in Charleston
earlier this season.

The ‘Kitten cagers honored
Coaches Holland and Maj. Har-
old Fraley with a post-game trip
to the showers after the State
victory. It was a smal! price to
pay for giving Davidson its most
successful athletic team in
years.

COACHES FRALEY (L) AND HOLLAND ASSESS EACH OTHER
Washing Honors Coaches For Clean Slate

‘Defensive Pride, Rebounds’

Key To 16-0 Mark: Holland

By DON SEWELL
Sports Writer

Davidson’s freshman hoopsters became the first undefeated Wildcat basketball

team in the school’s history by closing out their
Carolina State Wednesday night. The win brou

a fitting climax to a season

Terry Holland, who coached
the Wildkittens to their unblem-
ished mark, had nothing but
praise for his boys. ‘They de-
serve all the credit. Their tre-
mendous individual pride on de-
fense, their great job on both the
defensive and offensive boards
have combined to make them
impossible to beat.”

Everyone who has seen the
freshmen play has been im-
pressed by their speed and their
fantastic shooting. ‘Everyone is
good so it is hard to play a
man to man against us. We han-
dle the ball and shoot well
enough that a zone will not work
either,’’ Holland added.

Varsity Coach Lefty Driesell
called these frosh the best fresh-
man team he has seen since he
has been coaching here for sev-
en years.

All season long. the Wildkit-
tens showed that they were a
complete team, doing everything
well. They averaged around 90
points and over 50 rebounds a
game. Holland summed up the
opinion held by many fans when
he added that he has not seen a
weakness in the team all year.

Among their victims. the ‘Kit-

times.
Davidson hit. on nine of 14

tens counted strong teams from
Wake Forast, South Carolina,
Duke, and N. C. State. Wake had
been ranked the number two
freshman team in the nation in
a pre-season poll. They fell twice
to the win-hungry Wildkittens.

Gardner Webb Junior College
was ranked among the top jun-
ior college teams in the country
during the season, but they fell
easy prey also, as did a strong
team from Brevard Junior Col-
lege.

Depth and balance are the se-
crets which have kept the fresh-
men on a winning trail. “We
have four boys capable of 20
points and 10 rebounds every
game," said assistant coach
Major Harold Fraley. They are
Mike Maloy, Doug Cook, Jerry
Kroll and Jan Postma.

Before he broke his wrist after
playing in 11 games, Maloy had
a 21.9 scoring average and a 14.9
rebounding average. Playing a
brand of basketball that pleased
the fans and bewildered his op-
ponents, he was aconstant
threat to score.

After Maloy's injury, Cook
proved to be the man to take up
the scoring slack. Pouring in 30

| |received last Friday at the hands
of an undefeated Citadel squad.
Davidson's wrestling team de-
parted Wednesday for the con-
ference wrestling tournament in
Morgantown, W. Va., confident
of making a strong showing.

The Citadel loss was only the
second incurred over an eight-
game slate by the Wildcat mat-
men, who finished their regular
season with the best record com-
piled by a Davidson wrestling
team since 1935. Captain Joe
Buffington kept his personal
mark unblemished in registering
the ‘Cats only victory against
the Bulldogs.

The squad's only other points
came as a result of draws earn-
ed by Kerry Keith and Colin
Hudson. Keith, previously unde-
feated, dropped down a weight
class and tangled with a return-

made the freshman first team a
point producer that could not be
topped. Playmaker Fox Demoi-
sey's ball handling and passing
set the stage for the freshmen
scoring performances.

The team adjusted smoothly to
moving Kroll to the pivot. De-
moisey to wing, and Randy
Jones to the point after Maloy
was hurt. This was the only ma
jor change in the attack all year.

Holland cited Jones for spe-
cial praise for his job of han-
dling the point position at the
end of the year. Other key sub-
stitutes were Davis Liles and
Johnny Baker.

“Team spirit and cooperation
are on the highest possible level
on this team. There is absolute.
ly no selfishness. This has been
another important factor in our
ability to win,”’ added Fraley.

Praising the frosh for not let-
ting other teams rattle them,
he pointed out that no opponent
was ever able to change the
Wildkittens’ style of play.

The biggest disappointments
that fans of the frosh suffered
this season was the inability of
scheduling a game against the
UNC freshmen. Many observers
felt that this would have been 4
legitimate contest for the best
freshman team in the nation.
But the game did not material.
ize and the Wildkittens have to
let their perfect record stand as
evidence of their ability.

Both the Wake Forest and N.
C. State freshmen posted wins
over the Carolina frosh this sea-
son.

To say that this freshman
team offers great potential to
the Wildcat varsity for the next
few seasons would be to greatly
understate the facts. For the
first time since Holland was a
senior and Dick Snyder a sopho

but West Virginia and VMI. who
handed the Wildcat grapplers
their other defeat, will be for-
midable foes. East Carolina and
William and Mary, while not
having entire teams at the tour-
nament, will furnish some out-
standing individuals, Parker
said.
