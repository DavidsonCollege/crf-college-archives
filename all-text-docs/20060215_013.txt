Kwan, ‘Grandma Luge’ taken down by injuries

By KEVIN BIRNEY
Staff Writer

This past week, the sports world shifted its
attention from Detroit to Torino, Italy, as the
Super Bowl gave way to the skiing, snow-
boarding and skating of the 2006 Winter
Olympic Games. .

The Italians, who blew up enough fire-
works during the Opening Ceremony to melt
the snow off the Alps, kicked off the world-
wide action on Saturday. Here’s a recap of
the major stories over the first weekend, plus
a preview of things to come:

Skiing

If only because of the controversial Bode
Miller, skiing has had some of the most com-
pelling stories early on in the games. Miller,
considered the United States’ best skier,
skipped practice on Monday after his disap-
pointing fifth place finish in downhill over
the weekend.

Refreshingly honest, Miller created a
media frenzy this summer in response to
comments that skiing drunk is “not easy”
and that he got “super-super-shitfaced” and
pretty much “went from the bar to the race”
before a competition in March 2005. Miller
still finished sixth in the event.

Nike then sponsored Miller under the
phrase “Join Bode,” without saying whether
he should be on TV or drunk on a double
black diamond. Despite being favored to
medal in several events, the New Hampshire
native has since been disqualified in the
slalom.

On a more sad note, American Lindsey
Kildow had a horrific crash in practice on
Monday and had to be taken out on a stretch-
er. ESPN.com’s less-than-sympathetic head-
line read: “That thud you heard in Torino

was _ probably
another
American stum-
ble.” Many had
projected Kildow
to win gold.

Hockey

Struggling in
the United States
but highly antici- >
pated in Torino, —
hockey features a
loaded Canadian
team that will
only be chal-
lenged by |
Sweden and per-
haps the Czech
Republic. With
Wayne Gretzky
in tow, the
Canadians are
the favorites.

T h e
Americans,
picked to finish
sixth by Sports Illustrated , will have to pull
a Miracle Redux to earn a medal. ;

Figure Skating

The big story here has been Michelle
Kwan, who came to Torino seeking an elu-
sive first gold medal but will leave with an
injury instead. Perhaps the _ greatest
American skater ever, Kwan has won five
world titles and nine U.S. titles but has con-
sistently been shut out of Olympic victory.

“I’m not 13 anymore,” Kwan said while
announcing her withdrawal due to medical
reasons. Following her announcement, many

Miller has been at the center of controversy.

criticized Kwan
for showing up at
all, accusing her
of being selfish
and taking the
spot of an
American who
could have done
better. Others
admired her desire
to try one last
time.

Luge and
Skeleton

For those who
haven’t watched the luge and skeleton yet,
these events are crazy. A man or woman
straps him- or herself to a board and flies
down a curved ice ramp at an average of 80-
85 mph. The skeleton features an athlete on
his stomach, while in the luge the athlete lies
on his back.

The ramp has many turns and hazards for
the competitors to navigate. Aptly named,
skeleton is comparable to scaling a cliff; one
wrong step could lead to death.

Anne Abernathy, a 52-year-old woman, is
a highlight of this year’s luge competition.
She is officially representing the Virgin
Islands in luge, but unfortunately, “Grandma

Luge,” as she is called, broke her hand in
practice and now might not be able to com-

pete.

Snowboarding

Shaun White, long the United States’ gold-
en boy in snowboarding, lived up to expecta-
tions in his first event, winning gold in the
half-pipe. Teammate Danny Kass also won
silver.

The women followed suit a day later, as
Hannah Teter took the gold and Gretchen
Bleiler earned the silver. All in all, snow-
boarding has probably been the US’s best
performance so far.

Snowboarding has also spawned a new
Winter Olympic sport: snowboardcross.
Four boarders race at a time, going down a
0.43-mile-long track at extremely high
speeds.

The constant danger of the boarders crash-
ing into each other and the way they all fly
off the jumps at the same time make the
event a must-see.

Miscellaneous

Many people prefer other games over
speed skating, but the Americans are faring
well in that sport, having already won two
golds in three races. Joey Cheek won the
men’s 500 meter and Chad Hedrick won the
men’s 5000 meter.

The sport of curling features a team that
brushes the ice with brooms so that a disc
can slide as accurately as possible towards a
target. So far, the US stands undefeated in
curling action, defeating Norway 11-5.

The mascots of the Torino games, two
stick-like figures with blocks of ice for
heads, have come under criticism. The mas-
cots were chosen after winning an interna-
tional competition.
