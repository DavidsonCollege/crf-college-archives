ATHLETIC HEAD
TALK ON RADIO

Captain N. G. Pritchett Discusses
the Place of Athletics in
Education

Davidson College held its weekly ra-
dio program last Friday night at 9
o'clock. The first number was “O Da-
vidson,” played upon the organ. Don-
ald Pfohl then offered two flute solos,
first, “A Rest,” by. Catherine, and then
“The Idol,” by Gounod. Mrs. Louise
Pfohl was the accompanist in both se-
lections.

The program was announced by Grier
Martin, alumni secretary, who then in-
troduced Captain Norton G: Pritchett,
director of Physical Education from Da-
vidson. Captain Pritchett gave the
main talk of the eveniig on “What Is
the Place of Athletics in Education?”

Two men were given as examples in
his talk. The first, Butch Bullenski, was
one who was great and very outstand-
ing in athletics and a good prize fighter
but stupid and slow with his studies. To
this young man who had graduated and
was still going on in life the same
way, this question was asked: “Do you
think athletics has a place in- educa-
tion?” :

The answer was: “That’s not a hard
nut to crack. Sports taught me more
than all that stuff in-class. That’s why
the news guys calt me the educated
fighter.” The other, Professor Facilicus,
was a very learned man who was noted
for his work in the eighth dimension.

In reply to the same question, he an-
swered: “There is no more relation be-
tween athleti¢s and education than there
is between bull fighting and agricul-
ture.”

Captain Pritchett stated that this is
altogether wrong, but that some ath-
letes consider a contest in sports a mere
exhibition ground, while others with the
right idea consider it a testing ground
for themselves. He ended his speech
by stating that he thought athletics was
a basic principle of education.

Following Captain Pritchett’s talk, a
new feature was inaugurated into the
Davidson program, the news of the Da-
vidson College campus being given.
Each week special events will be an-
nounced. One special announcement was
the coming of Joseph Brinkman, a fa-
mous pianist, who is to give a program
in Chambers Auditorium on Tuesday,
February 12th. c

The program was concluded by Ken-
neth Scott's rendition of “Liberstraum,”
by Lier.

Term Grades Are Now
Available To Students

Term grades are being rapidly com-
piled at the registrar’s office, and are
being as rapidly posted in room 118,
Chambers, where they are available to
students throughout the day. Contrary
to custom, copies of these term grades
will not be mailed to the students, al-
though they will be mailed to parents by
Friday, February 1st.

All grades made during or after last
Monday are put on the record of the
second semester, and cuts are now
counted against the students’ new allot-
ments.

Roth Presents
Talk On Alaska

those who were responsible for
Roth's being here.

‘When Dr. Roth lectured here about
two years age he had as his subject,
“South America.’ One of the. largest
audiences ever to attend a lecture here
was present, and many favorable com-
ments on the manner of presentation on
both of his lectures are now forthcom-
ing.

This lecture was free and was the first
to be presented by the school during this
school year. However, according to Dr.
Shewmake, who is chairman of the
faculty committee on lectures, several
other lectures are to be presented dur-
ing this semester. Dr. Shewmake stated
that announcements concerning these
lectures would be made later on.

Val Cassells as Thibault; and Archie
Coleman as Perrine.

Billy Pierce will serve as stage-man-
ager, assisted by Henry Eve, Ed Wom-
ble, and Tom Wood. ;

As soon as this three-act comedy has
been learned it will be given at a public
meeting held in Chambers auditorium.
This meeting will be held jointly with
the members of the Converse College
French club, and delegates from that in-
stitution will also present a French
Comedy, the well-known Le Voyage de
M. Perrichon.

of the 1935 rifle team, the R. O.
T. C. unit will hold a competitive
tryout in rifle marksmanship next
week.

The shooting will be done indi-
vidually between February 4 and 9,

ters staff at all times. Scores must
be turned in to the manager of the

Gwynns Entertain
Cabinet Members

Merriam, of the Religious Educa-
tion Council, and E. A.
Yarrow Are Guests

Dr. and Mrs. Price W. Gwynn enter-
tained the local “Y” Cabinet in their
home on Monday night, January 4. Pres-
ent for the occasion were Mr. T. W.
Merriam, secretary of the National
Council on Religious Education, and Mr.
E. A. Yarrow, field secretary of the
Hagen Foundation.

After a delightful buffet supper, the
guests engaged in a general discussion.
Messrs, Gwynn and Merriam were both
interested in. the religious life and activi-
ties of undergraduates in our American
colleges. They talked with various mem-
bers of the Administration and faculty
and seemed much impressed with the
spiritual atmosphere of the Davidson
campus.

Coaching Classes Held
In Freshman Subjects

For about two weeks before examina-
tions began, coaching classes were held
in several freshman subjects for stu-
dents who were deficient in these sub-
jects.

These classes were taught by students
who were doing good work in the sub-
ject, or by upperclassmen who hade done
good work when they were taking the
Subject. These teachers were paid by
the FERA,

Classes were held in the following
subjects: French A, German A, Spanish
A, and Math I.

Hauptmann’s Trial

some of the jury have to be quartered in
the attic.

The local hostelry could not accom-
modate the throngs of people who de-
seended upon Flemington at meal time
so the Ladies Aid of the Methodist
Episcopal church is now feeding “the
hungry” instead of “the lost’ at 75 cents
per plate. However, they are paying off
that church debt and serve delicious
food. Betty Gow went there for lunch
the day she took the witness stand.

The report that prices have been run
up was found to be false. The Corres-
pondent of the Detroit News is staying
at one of these spic and span Fleming-
ton homes. He was assigned the master
bedroom and gets three mieals a day be-
sides all for $5.00. The sheets are
changed every day and a light was in-
stalled by his desk. The lady of the
house keeps the room herself and is al-
ways careful to keep a covering over his
typewriter.

Flemington is a pretty little town
which is typical of the places where 70
per cent of the people of this nation live.
There is the famous Hunterdon County
Court House. The building is construct-
ed along the lines of an old Southern
Mansion with white columns out: front.
The whole thing is covered over with
white wash which partially covers up the
cracks in its side. The witness chair in
the Court House is over a hundred years
old.

In the lobby of the Union hptel just
across the street you may run fe almost
anybody. An English correspondent,
smart Alice Hughes, of Hearst syndi-
cated; Damon Runyon, the sports writer ;
Mrs. Jack Dempsey, formerly Hannah
Williams, et al. There is the country
store where you can purchase anything
from a tooth brush to_a-side-of bacon.
And it really has an open cracker box
in the rear. Next to the general store
is the library. Although Flemington is a
small town it goes in strong for culture
and book clubs are very active.

First Semester Grades Sing
Swan Song To Examinations

For the last ten days a feeling of
tension and strain has pervaded the Da-
vidson campus. But now the lid is off,
EXAMS ARE OVER!

This familiar phrase brings to the ma-
jority a feeling of overwhelming joy,
a release from tightening chains of
bondage, and a happy oblivion of the
fact that, after all, the year is only half
over. At first, in the intoxication of the
let-down, all thought of exam results dis-
appears in a puff of smoke. But on the
morning after, when those neatly-typed
sheets of bad news are exposed to the
eyes of waiting students, the puff of
smoke descends in the form of a thick
black cloud.

Of course, this isn’t the case with all,
but if you notice the faces of your fel-
low students at the bulletin board, you'll
get a pretty revealing picture of the in-
ner thoughts of each. Naturally you'll
tind a look of half-hopeful expectancy
in the eyes of the waiting, and, in some
cases, mingled with a little worry. Others

College Officials —
Upheld By Jurist

Judge Otis E. Hungate, justice of the
Shawnee District Court in Topeka, Kan-
sas, recently denied the appeal of Ray-
mond McMahon, student at Kansas
State College, to injunction the R. O.
T. C. authorities at the college to re-
strain them from compelling young Mc-
Mahon to take the military training
course.

His decision is an important one in
that it upholds the fact that land grant
colleges can compel students to partici-
pate in R. O. T. C. because “the stu-
dents’ constitutional rights are not jeo-
pardized in that taking a military train-
‘ing is distinctly different from bearing
arms in time of war.” McMahon refused
to report for military drill at the begin-
ning of the school year and was sus-
pended by the college officials.

McMahon's case was the first time
the question had been ruled by a Kan-
sas court, and is important to the other
states for similar cases.

Ministerial Band Elects
Second Terms Officers

An election of officers for the remain-
ing part of this school year was held
by the Ministerial Band during its meet-
ing last Sunday at the Social Center.
Those elected were: President, J. M.
Smith; vice-president, J. Salango; sec-
retary-treasurer, L. C. Vass, who was re-
elected. The retiring officers are W. J.
B. Livingston, president, and J. C. Alex-
ander, vice-president.

The Band voted in favor of a two-
page section in the Annual this year.
An effort shall be made to make this
Section unusually attractive and inter-
esting.

are more cheerful and push happily
through the crowd to see the A that they
know darn well is on the other side.
But if it should be a B, oh gosh! Will
Aloysius have to tell his professor his
innermost thoughts, which are none too
complimentary! His professor probably
forgot he was one of the Virginia Twad-
dies. Professors are that way.

Then there's the other happy guy who
made D in Basic Math. He's even more
joyous ‘cause he passed and that's a lot.
After all, it’s a lot more fun to make
low grades, because you'll never attain
the peak of just making it if you're on
the Dean's list.

The cause of these expressions is no
mere trifling bulletin board. It’s the guil-
lotine. Heads fall as students stop to
look, but those that fall were thrust in
thoughtlessly and left to await the blade.
The more wily and foreseeing climb atop
the chopper and, perched there, chortle
gleefully at the gore.

Button, Button, Who
Got The Questions?

A rather typical example of the
manner in which stories and facts
can be twisted by constant repeti-
tion took place here recently.

The Davidson grapevine
graph had evidently swung into ac-
tion, and an underclassman came
to Skip Brown, much in alarm.

He wanted to know for what rea-
son the Student Council was search-
ing the dormitories. Skip parlied
with a return question. ‘Well, why
IS the supposed search taking
place?”’ he asked.

The supposition was, he was told,
that, by way of a conflict exam,
someone had made away with the
exam questions. The faculty, after
meeting throughout the afternoon,
had turned the responsibility over
to the Council, and these gentle-
men were canvassing the dormitory
rooms to find the questions.

Query—who’s begging the ques-
tions?

ROTARTANS HEAR
PROF C.K. BROWN

Economics Professor Speaks at
Dinner on Recovery Prob-
lems and Assumptions

Dr. C. K. Brown of the Davidson fac-
ulty addressed the Charlotte Rotary
Club at their weekly dinner last Tues-
day, January 21st.

Dr. Brown chose as his subject “The
the Assump-
tions Upon Which We Wish to Build
Our Commonwealth in the | Future.”
When speaking of the recovery that is
now™being carried out, Dr. Brown said
that recovery was not of any use until
we knew what we wished to recover.

He then proceeded to discuss three
sets of conflicting assumptions which
might be made. ‘The first: Human na-
ture is considered essentially good and
that it requires only an opportunity to
show its goodness. This was contrasted
with the assumption that we are not,
by nature, essentially good and hence no
government can establish an Utopia. He
remarked that on this last point many
pedple thought that there would never
be a good government because of the
predominating faults of the people. The
second: Economic problem is the funda-
mental problem of society. He contrast-
ed this with the assumption that the
economic problem is only one of a num-
ber of complex problems. From’ the
latter assumption, it would follow that
all our difficulties would not be over
even if the economic problem should be
solved. The third: Freedom, which is
one of the greatest objectives of society,
means the right to do certain particular
things. Notably among these particular
things are the rights to receive income
and consume goods. This was contrasted
with the assumption that freedom is to
be defined in abstract terms as an attrib-
ute of human will. This refers to the
right to achieve higher development, a
right to be something and a right to do
something.

Dr. Brown closed his address by add-
ing that we will have to make up our
minds on which assumptions are to be
made. On these assumptions and others
a government is built. Thus we can-
not proceed until we know which way
to go.
