FRIDAY,

Among The Greeks

PI KAPPA PHI
Dear Charlie,

I guess it’s time for me to write
you another letter. Things are fine
with me and ! hope they are with
you.

Ob yes! You asked about the
brothers and pledges. There wasn’t
too much going on this week due
to reviews, but it scems that every-
one is, looking out for himself, as
usual. Odell is still making his fré-
quent trips to Charlotte, afd he is
being kept company this year by
Herb Johnson and Harold Jennings.
ilerb, Harold. Bud Edwards, and
Harry Powe have quite a rivalry
in Charlotte among their YMCA
fooat teams.

Pill Lander married his old flame,
Betty Higdon, last Saturday in
Charlotte. I know you're sorry you
weren't here for that. Claude and
Parks tell me that it was quite an
aliair.

4uster loaded his “maroon mon-
ster” with eager Epsilon brothers
aud journeyed up to see some Sa.
lem belles last week end. I over-
heard Underdown talking to Willer
anid. both scemed to agree that a
good time was had by all. Yeah
Charlie, we've got a bunch of play-
boys this year. Even “Hardwork- | a
ing” Al seems to be shining this
year. He told me just the other day
that ‘he had a date with a girl this
week end.

“Mouse” Murray was in need of
some of your good advice this week
end, He got another letter from
“Queenie” and seems like he will be
writing the Lovelorn column soon,
unless Cupid steps in. Mitehell and
Harold said that they went fishing,
but ] didg't see any fish. Guess
they didn’t catch any.

We have instituted some new
customs this year, Charlie, and 1
think they are doing a lot of good.
‘The “sings” every Tuesday night,
led by Sib, are a lot of fun. By the
way, the pledges have charge of
the program for the dance this year.
Kyvoryone ‘is looking forward to a
good time.

Well, | guess that’s all the news,
1 know for now, Charlie, I'l write

again next week.

scattered to the four corners of the
South per usial. Atlanta was host
to a few of our number including
Blake “The Snake" Bradley, Snook
Schwaemmle, “Globe Heatl" Me-
Williams, “Hot. Lips” Tucker, and
Jack “Pancho Gonzalez” Steven-
son, Manly said he couldn’t remem-
ber much about who he dated —
that’s the way it is with those Ag-
nes Scott. girls. Hampton “The

speeding toward the Salem dance on
Hampton's 1949 Super 1 1-2 mo-
torscooter, A youth listed as George
‘Bedroom Eyes’? Crouch was ar-

rested for one-armed driving in
Charlotte. Crouch named Neely
“Careless Hands’ Dixon as the

party caught necking in the back
seat along with “Blackie” Gilmer.
Could these be the Davidson “gem

that “Mauri Rose” Kirky is con:

going along to change tires.

Our football squad, led by seach
all.time greats as “Leon Hart’
Tucker ‘and “Glenn Davis” Al-
dred, may force history to repeat
itselé and win, the championship
again this year., With a lot of sup-
port from the non-playing brothers
and a full turn.out of the whoiec
tcam at every game we might"do
just that — if not our remaining
games could easily be repetitious of
the Phi Delt debacle. How ‘bout it

We are very honored these days
by having in our midst two world’s
champion yo yoers. If you are
quiet of foot and quick of eye you
may see one of these great stars in
action. Who are they, why none
other than “Pedro” Lyles and “Ro-
driguez’’ Preyer from the heart of
Honolulu, home of the Olympic
Yo Yo Team.

H. P. King is getting a new meter
put on his car this week so watch
out yon thumbers! Our pipe smok-
ing brethren have really been go-
ing wild over the Kool and Camel
men and their bargain pipes which

“cost you no more than they do

Hoof Tobacco.”

That's all the scoops yours truly
could dig up this week *-— it seems

S. A. BE.
Dear Mom,

If you could only see me now. Ail
tcan hear is. “You ‘should: have
been with me this weekend” or
“Boy, I've got to go back there
soon,”

Honestly it seems everybody went
off this week end except me. You
know how it is with all my work to
do; 1 just can’t tear myself away.

Now take some of them for in-
stance: Rennett, Doug, Riyers, Lit-
the Monty, Phil, Bill, and the “Ree-
fer’ all went to Greensboro. It
seems Rivers really “had it.’ He
dated some girl named = Parbara
Fair. 1 asked him how it was and
all he said was, “Fair.” | don't think
Bennett had a chance with Nance
tho’, at least he won't conmemt on
it. .

What I can’t figure out is what
has Atlanta got that Vaughn would
go down there for, Agnes Scott is
located there, but I thought he had
sworn off women. Another thing,
He took his little sister with him‘

T. C. had. his “Choo.Choo” roll
ing up to Sullins aud he hasn't re-
covered yet or is that the way he
is all the time?

The six weeks grades seemed to
have.a profound effect on the pled:
ges; we haven't seen them around
ax much as usual. Cc .

Those who J really like to see stay
around campus are Hutely and Du-
val. Now there are tivo good whole.
some boys | pattern myself after.
No trips — just good hard work?

Well, Mom, you can see how it
is. All this running around and no
work makes for no grad.

See you Christinas if not later—

as an alumnus. Joe Griffiths is tak-
ing practically ‘the entire pledge

make “socialites out of them. Joe
had taken John “Sexy eyes” Kel-|:

Foundation Studies
Undergraduate
Buying Habits

“Undergraduate heads on high
school and college campuses are
filled with other things besides his-
tory, languages and math, accord-
ing to a survey recently completed
for Brand Names Foundation, In-
corporated, by the Student Market.
ing Institute of New York. Along
with the’ more usual subjects in
every school ‘curriculum, students
know their brand names and trade-
marks and are current on the latest
in advertising. The surveys show-
ed that America’s students rely on
manufacturers’ brand names in
thaking 7 out of 10 of their pur-
chases,

To complete this study, the In.
Stitute made, more than 61,000 in-
quiries with the help of teachers
and professors. Campus undergrad-
uates numbering 1,895 were quizzed
at forty-four colleges and high
schools. Researchers asked students
how they bought eighty-six differ-
ent products in an effort to find the
influence or influences which shap-.
ed shopping decisions. Among the
alternatives in the questionnaire
were: (1) demand for one specific,
manufacturer’s brand name; (2)
preference for one of several makers’
brand names; (3) reliance on store
recommendation and reputation;
and (4) the convenient locations
of stores,

The survey uncovered many in-
teresting sidelights on student fash-
ions and buying habits and proved
that today’s crop of academi-
cians, in addition to being the $o-
called “shoppers of tomorrow,” con-
Stitute a healthy portion of today’s
buying public. Examining the total
number of buying attitudes rec-
orded, the findings showed that
69.3 per cent of the purchases made
by all students were brand-influ-
enced, with students requesting one
specific bramd name or accepting
one of several specific makes, Store
reputation and recommendation
were reported to be the primary
guide in only 19.1 per cent of all pur-
chases. Apparently students are
willing to go out‘ of their way to
find the specific brand names they
like, for only 11.6 per cént named
“store location and convenience” as
a consideration governing purchas-
es.

Brand names mean just about as
much to boys as they do to girls,
the survey revealed, with girls te-
ing slightly more brand-minded,
percentage-wise. Regarding the oth-
er alternatives listed in the survey, |.

the findings showed that store rec-
ommendation and reputation arc
slightly more important to boys
than to girls; while boys are slight-
ly more influenced by the conven-
ience of near-by stores. On the
question of “high school versus col-
lege students,” the survey showed
that 72.3 per cent of the former’s
purchases were governed by brand
loyalties\as contrasted with 66.1 per
cent for college students.

Of interest to fashion experts is
the increase in the trend toward
hat wearing revealed by the sur-
vey. Bare “noggins,”” according to
the findings, are on their way out
and students are becoming increas-

years ago, the theory prevailed that
wearing hats leads to baldness. T'o-
day’s crop of less impressionable
students seems to place its faith in

hat wearing is not only a matter
of fashion but of health and com-
fort as well.

Previous Record of
Homecoming Scores

October, 1923 saw the Cats get
off to a rollicking homecoming start
by a victory over the Citadel of
Z to 0. This was the christening of
the new Richardson field, and al-
though the season was marked
down as one of success for Coach
Youtiger, the Cats. came through
with only three victorics due te
“handicaps in lack of linesmen.”

The hext year saw one of the
most successful seasons in the Col-
lege’s history in spite of the fact
that the homecoming game was lost
to Carolina. After years and vears
of football despair the cats finally
came through with 7 victories, 2
lasses, and 1 tie. 1925 was non the
less spectacular with 6 victories and
2 ties.

Tt was not until that eventful
year, 1926; however, that the Cats
were to chalk up another homecom-
ing victory. The day's festivities be-
wan with a dress parade Ly the
ROTC and were clintaxed during
the afternoon by the game with The
University of N.C. Playing their
best fot a record crowd in the new-
ly dédicated stadium, the Cats roll-
ed over Caroliria for a 10 to 0 vie- .
tory. The season saw only two de-
feats, and was climaxed by the Cat's
defeat of Duke for 8tate Cham-
pionship.

Not again until 1939 were the
Cats suceessiul on the homecoming
ficld when they defeated their first
opponents by a score of 22 to }4
in a display of their powerful of-
fense,
