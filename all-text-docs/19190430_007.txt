Practical Address
Made By Dr. Douglas

Urges All to Make the Most of Every
Opportunity.

The Y. M. C. A. was indeed fortu-
nate in hearing Dr. D. M. Douglas last
Sunday night. He has been at Davidson
visiting his brothers, Drs. J. M. and J.
L. Douglas. Dr. Douglas graduated
from Davidson in the class of “95. ‘Then,
upon completion. of his course at the
Seminary, took up his pastoral work and
has been, pastor of several important
churches. While serving a church in
Baltimore, he was called to the presi-
dency of the Presbyterian College of
South Carolina and accepted the call.

His talk was one of the most practical
that the fellows have had the privilege
of hearing. Everyone can profit by tak-
ing it to heart. He based his address
on the verse taken from the blessings of
Isaac: “Bless me, even me also, O my
Father.” Dr. Douglas very forcibly ex-
plained how that, by the deception of
Jacob, Esau was reaping that which he
had sown in earlier years when he sold
his birthright. ‘The same thing is, true
today. When a person finds himself
overburdened with trouble on account of
financial failure, intellectual deficiency or
spiritual failure, he can, by looking back
over his past. life a few years locate the
cause of his misfortune. He can find
the time when he was sowing the seed.
the result of which he is now reaping,
God gives everyone the ability in the be-
ginning and by so doing holds cach re-
sponsible for the power given him. “Vhus
God cannot be expected to help the in-
dividual by miracles when that person
dees not make use of his opportunities.

In closing, Dr. Douglas stated that,
on the contrary, the success of every
person can be traced back to. sometime
in his earlier life when every opportunity
was utilized. Everyone should strive to
use the opportunities which God gives to
him. 4

“The evangelization of the world in
the next generation” is the goal set for
missions as studied by the Forum in the
light of the advantages resulting from
the world war. All great advances in
modern missions have had their birth in
the reconstruction and consequent oppor-
tunity after every war. There is great
need now for National Christianity even
among so-called Christian Nations as
shown by the selfishness of the Nations
at the Peace Conference.

Never before has the Church had such
opportunities and advantages calling for
immediate action. Through the broad-
ening influences of the war Foreign Mis-
sions have become the natural home field
of the Church. All fields are now open
to the victorious Gospel of Christ as
they never have been before. Mohamme-
danism long held Asia and Africa in
darkness. ‘The failure of Islam to enter
the Sultan's “Holy War" was the signal
of his defeat. The separation of Asia
Minor and the alliance of Egypt and
India with the Allies have thrown open
the doors of the “Dark Continents” of
the Eastern Hemisphere for Christ's
Kingdom to go in.

Never before has the church had the
responsibility of such resources in inter-
est, in experience and in money. The
$50,000,000 for one day, which the U.
S. is now expending every day, will put
cnough workers in the field for one year
to preach the Gospel to every Nation in
this generation. This will mean the giv-
ing by every Christian in America of
one cent ($.01) per day.

This great responsibility rests upon
every Christian: to render to God the
things that are God's; to study intelli-
gently, prayerfully ahd faithfully ; to in-
terest others in giving themselves and

gjon three hits

| their means in this, the greatest mission

of Christ. The greatest and only power
unto salvation is prayer—the prayer of
faith. But one must first surrender him-
self and all that he hath to go to the
front or serve with his life wherever he
can be of the greatest power.

ATHLETIC NEWS.

(Continued from Page 6)
Freshmen won an 8 to 5 victory over
the Juniors. Errors were frequent on
both sides and were responsibie tor most
of the scoring. Murphy, pitching for
the Freshmen, struck out 11 men and
with reasonable support should have shut
out his opponents. Cathey, too. did
some good twirling and allowed, the
Freshmen only six hits, but these cou-
pled with as many errors and a wild
throw allowed the Freshmen to score
eight runs and win the game.

FRESH-JUNIOR CHAMPIONSELID,

In the second game between the two
classes the Juniors turned the tables on
the Freshmen by reversing the score of
the previous contest, and thereby wan the
class championship. Murphy and Cathey
opposed each other again in the pitcher's
box. Murphy had a shade the better of
the argument, allowing only six hits and
striking out two men, while Cathey al-
lowed nine hits and ‘struck out two men.
Errors on the part of the Freshmen ac-
counted for their defeat.

The Freshmen drew first blood when
the first three men to face Cathey scored.
Hyland tripled to right center and scored
on Murphy's three-bigger to left.
Mongomery drove in’ Murphy and
scored himself on a single which went
through Craig's legs tor a home run,

The Juniors came hack in their half
of the second inning and made five runs
and five errors. ‘The
Freshmen scoted twice in the third  in-
ning on hits by McLeod, Miller and
Ormend, thus tying the score.
side scored again until the ninth.

After one man was down in the ninth
Craig was hit by a pitched ball and took
second on a single by Frank Hall; Prep
Hall walked and the bases were full.
Craig scored on Hyland's error of Bra-
dy’s grounder and Black scored both
Halls by his hot single to center. In
their half of the inning the Freshmen
got men on second and third but were
unable to cross the plate.

The features of the game were the
all-round playing of Black and Craig's
catch of a long fly from Miller's bat in
the eighth. Montgomery played a pretty
game for the Freshmen.

HERE AND THERE.

“How would you like to sign up with
me for a life game?” was the way a
baseball fan proposed.

“Tam agreeable,” replied the girl,
“where is your diamond?”

—Exchange.

“Are they seasoned troops?”

“They ought to be. They were first
mustered in by their officers and then
peppered by the enemy.”

—Exchange.

Frank was in school when the teacher
said: ‘Who knows what the five senses
are?”

“Nickels.”

On one transport going over, one ne-
gro trooper said to another, a very sea-
sick boy, “Look out dere and see dat
sail boat.”

“Don’t you call me for no sail boat,
nigger,” came from the sick fellow lying
with his head on his arms, “don't you
call me at all unless you see a tree.”

Then there was the story of the crap-
shooting negro in the artillery regiment,
whose job was to feed the shells to the
big guns. Each time he drove the shell
into the breech and the gun boomed, he
jumped high in the air and, with a
characteristic crap-shooting crack of the
fingers, shouted: “Count your men, Mr.
Kaiser, count your men.” “Then as an-
other shell was driven home and the
gun fired another jump, another shout
of “Count ‘em again, Mr. Kaiser. count
‘em again.’ ”

A captain said to a company of ne-
groes, “Now, | want you fellows to
learn this game thoroughly. Suppose
our company is holding the line here
and the Boche makes a direct charge at
us across this field, what would you
boys do?”

“Well, captain,” came from one mem-
ber of the company, “we sho would
spread the news over France,”
