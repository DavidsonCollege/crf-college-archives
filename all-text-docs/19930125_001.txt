Davidson Football to Maintain
Status Quo Despite Change

By Bruce Balestier

Legislation at last week’s
NCAA Convention mandated that,
in order for Davidson’s entire ath-
letic program to remain at the Di-
vision I level, the football program
must move to the more expensive
and competitive Division I-AA
level. Buta niche in the legislation
will allow the team to continue to
play a Division III schedule.

The NCAA acknowledges a
subdivision of I-AA programs that

play cost-containment football,
schools that attempt to diminish
the cost of playing at the I-AA
level by keeping scholarships to a
minimum. Since at this time, ac-
cording to the NCAA, there are not
six schools within a 500-mile ra-
dius of Davidson that play cost-
containment I-AA football, the
football program was granted a
geographical waiver. The waiver
exempts Davidson from I-AA
scheduling requirements, so that

the football team can continue to
play a schedule of Division III
opponents.

But Athletic Director Terry
Holland isn’t sure Davidson even
needs the geographical exemption.
According to Holland, it’s pos-
sible that Davidson, though classi-
fied as Division I-AA, could con-
tinue to play a Division III sched-
ule and fail to meet I-AA schedul-

National Coach of the Year Charlie Slagle directed the Cats to
the Soccer Final Four. Coach Jim ‘Wright and Freshman
& Ryan Northington look on with Slagle during the -
first round match at UNCC.

Reyna won the Missouri Athletic
Commission MVP award and
UCLA goalkeeper Brad Friedel
won the Herrmann Award, for
which Reyna and Ukrop were the
other finalists. Said Davidson
coach Charlie Slagle, “Rob was
deserving of being one of the top
three people in soccer this year.”

Ukrop’s season totals for goals
and points were both Davidson
records. He concluded his career
with 76 goals, 32 assists and 184
points, all Davidson records as well.

The official presentation of the Adi
Dassler to Ukrop will occur at half-
time of the UNC-Charlotte-
Davidson basketball game tad
ary 10 in Belk Arena.

Slagle was named the Divi-
sion I Coach of the Year January

Association of America. The award

Students May See Steady
Increase in Activities Tax

By Leigh Rawdon
On Tuesday evening, January
19 at the SGA meeting, the Union
Board presented a proposal that

significantly changes student ac-

tivity funding. Ann Todd, Union
Board President, and William
Brown, Union Director, recom-
mended to the Senate that the ac-
tivity fee be determined annually
as one percent of tuition. They
alsoadvised that the Activities Tax
. Council assume responsibility for
all funds collected by the fee. The
Senate approved both motions with
five votes against the one percent
indicator of the tax increase.

Lawson McWhorter, Activi-

ties Tax Council Chair, hopes “that
the new money will spark student
imagination for new activities and
organizations. The new policy is
the logical thing todo. It willallow
the ATC more flexibility allocat-
ing funds to studentorganizations.”
McWhorter has served on the
Council for three years and has
seen the council become a more
active committee ensuring student
funds are spent efficiently.

Until now half of the money
collected from the student activi-
ties tax immediately became a part
of the Union Board’s budget. The
Activities Tax Council allocated
the other half to student organiza-

tions such as Reach Out, IMAC,
SGA, and The Davidsonian. Inthe
past years the council has played a
more importantrole by keeping up
with organizations’ budgets
throughout the year to ensure that
student funds are used according
to plans. Gradually the ATC has
gained the power to allow students
to oversee every allocation of their
activity fee.

The activity tax forthe current
academic year was $130. Twenty
years ago the tax was $80. The
Union proposal noted that this is a
62% increase when the tuition has

Davidson’s handling of the
NCAA Soccer Tournament’s Fi-
nal Four, held December 4 and 6 of
last year, has thus far elicited only
praise from participants, observ-
ers and NCA peroupel alike.

\A attendance
records ics the event by drawing
sell-out crowds of 8,150 for each
of the three games, and plans are
-already in the works to expand
Richardson Field’s capacity for
next year’s Final Four to about
10,000 with additional temporary
seating.

Those in charge of the event at
Davidson, including men’s soccer
coach Charlie Slagle and Tourna-
ment Director Jim Wright, report
that careful planningresolved most
of the logistical problems that
scared them before theevent. “With
just some minor difficulties which
can be easily ironed out, I think it
went as smoothly as we could have
imagined. We tried to think of
things thatcould go wrong, and we
did a pretty good job,” Slagle said.

Said Wright, “Overall, things
went nearly as well as we could
have expected. Our biggest worry
was whether we could handle the
parking problems that 8,000 people
wouldcreate. We felt that the prop-

" erty just off the interstate would be

ideal and, as it turned out, it was.
On both days we had the parking
area cleared just over an hour after
the games were finished. Thank-

fully, the weather cooperated and
everything went well.”

The NCAA was especially
pleased with Davidson’s handling,
led by women’ssoccercoach Kevin
Hundley, of the Youth Education

_ through Sports (YES) Clinic held _

attended, and were instructed by
Davidson players and numerous
other college players and coaches.
Slagle added a new touch to the
clinic by introducing the parents at
the clinic to the various coaches
and players.

“The NCAA officials, includ-
ing the head of youth programs,
were here and thought it was one of
the best, if not the best, YES Clin-
icsthat they’ ve had,” Hundley said.

The most obvious success of
the Davidson effort was the atmo-

' sphere it created for the games

themselves. The Final Fourcoaches
were unanimous in calling it the
type of setting that the event de-
served but had never before got-
ten. “It’s a great venue for soccer,”
said San Diego coach Seamus
McFadden.

’ Looking to build on the initial
success, Davidson officials had
planned to seek an extension to the
school’s contract as host, but were
beaten to the punch by satisfied
NCAA officials, who have already
suggested that Davidson be
awarded the event for 1994.
