Trustees grant faculty 12.5% salary increase; raise student fees $575

By ELIZABETH KISS
News Editor

The Board of Trustees approved
College President Samuel Spencer’s
proposals for increases in faculty and
staff compensation and student fees at
their February budgetary meeting.

The budget, which will be finalized
later this Spring, calls for a 12.5%
increase in faculty compensation. Tui-
tion will go up $500 and room and board
$75.

“Significant reductions” occurred in
several areas, including athletics, the
development department, and student
services, Spencer said. Widespread, but
officially unconfirmed, rumors have it
that the athletic budget was cut by
approximately $85,000.

The library budget was increased, as

were physical plant expenses, ‘purely

for energy and maintenance costs,”’
according to Spencer. Most other items
in the budget remained unchanged from
this year.

The Trustee vote modified Spencer’s
proposal by specifying that all compen-
sation increases be on a strictly merit
basis. The original proposal, announced
by Spencer February 5, called for a 5%
across-the-board increase that would
have established a new salary base.

Spencer will give a more detailed

report concerning the compensation
increases at the faculty meeting next
Tuesday.

French Professor Hallam Walker said

he was ‘“‘very pleased’’ with the Trustee
decision. While he ‘‘would be happier
with some increment across the board”’
instead of the purely merit-based in-
creases, Walker commented the “good
will and understanding on the part of the
Trustees” and said he felt there was ‘‘a
lot more communication and under-
standing on both sides.”’

Psychology Professor and Advisory
Council on Finance member. John Kello
was also pleased with the outcome of the
Trustee meeting, although he said he did
not know why the compensation in-
creases were made ‘‘so discretionary.”

“Having seen the budget in the
process of preparation, I can say that
President Spencer did all that was
reasonably possible,” Kello said.

Faculty reaction has ‘‘generally been
favorable,’’ according to Religion Profes-
sor David Kaylor. Kaylor said the
Trustees’ endorsement of Spencer’s pro-
posal was ‘‘good news,” and showed a

“substantial attempt to improve the
situation.’

Kaylor said the request for a 15%
compensation increase made by the
Davidson_chapter of the American
Association of University Professors
(AAUP) was still ‘“‘justified,’”’ but he was
‘‘glad that the President made as
significant a step as he did.”

‘“‘We hope (the increase) is the
beginning ofa process, not a one-year
desperation move—a process to get the
College’s priorities in order,’’ Kaylor
said.

Majority of faculty participates in SGA’s evaluation

By ROY FULLER
Staff Writer

About sixty percent of the
faculty participated in the
SGA-sponsored student evalua-
tion at the end of last term by
distributing Student Instruc-
tional Reports (SIR) forms to
their classes.

The SGA bought the forms
and will send them to New Jer-
sey at the end of the week to be
processed.

SGA Vice President Richard
Terry said results of the evalua-
tion have not yet been tallied
and so the amount of student
participation is not yet known.

SGA President John Jackson
explained that SGA members
feel student evaluation forms
are necessary for allowing stu-
dent input on tenure decisions.
He said student evaluation
forms should thus be manda-
tory and used by the admini-
stration in tenure decisions.
However, the SIR evaluation
was voluntary and results will
only be for professors’ private
use.

Jackson said, ‘Each year

there is a great student, uproar «

about tenure. If students felt
they had more input in the

decision making of the admini-
stration on this issue, that up-

roar could be avoided.”

At the faculty meeting next’
Tuesday, Jackson and other
SGA members hope to learn
about the faculty’s attitude
toward the SIR form and the
possibility of adopting it for
future use.

According to Jackson, the
purpose of the SGA project was
to impress upon the faculty the
importance of student evalua-
tion. “‘We want to show how
serious the students are about
evaluating classes. We also
want to show the faculty that
there is some unfinished busi-
ness that they need to attend
to,” he said.

The ‘unfinished business”
concerns the choice of a stand-
ardized student evaluation
form. The Code of Faculty
Evaluation Procedures, au-
thored primarily by Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs Price
Zimmerman and approved by
the faculty in 1979, includes a
provision for student evaluation
using a standardized form.

The faculty agreed to use the

- ICES form for a two year trial

period but reneged ‘on their
agreement fall'term.

“As far as I’m concerned,”
said Jackson, “the faculty has
acknowledged the necessity of a

student evaluation form...no
form is perfect, but I think the
faculty should be happy with
the best form available.’
Jackson believes the success
of the SGA effort cannot yet be
fully judged. “So far, we can
only say it was successful in the
sense that so many teachers

Council calls for
bonfire violators

By GLENN KELLUM
Assistant News Editor _

The Student Conduct Council

issued a plea last month for
anyone directly involved in the
February 5 bonfire incident to
“assume the responsibility of
their actions.” Iméhat bulletin,
the Council said grounds for
punishment were ‘‘the destruc-
tion of college property, the use
of fireworks, and especially,
throwing bottles at the firemen
and firetruck.”
' The reports have been few.
“There seems to be a tone of
self-righteousness among the
students,” according to Dean of
Students Will Terry. “Only two
people have come forward,”
Terry said. “We have dealt with
one case and have investigated
two others.” As for the stu-
dents who threw things at the
firemen, ‘no one has admitted
or reported anyone,” Terry
said. ‘‘We don’t know who they
are.”’

The consequences will depend
on each individual case, ‘‘any-
thing from censure to suspen-
sion,’’ Terry said. Certainly
restitution will be involved and
perhaps fines; however, “I'm
not wild about fines, but they
may be appropriate in some
