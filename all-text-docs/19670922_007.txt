Kelly Is Benched
For Five Weeks

Sophomore end Mike Kelly
has been benched for about
five weeks because of injur-
ie. coach Homer Smith has
announced.

The 6-4, 195 pound starter
received a fractured ankle
sometime earlier in the sea-
son, although the time of the
injury is not known. He had
been bothered by leg pains
and had not responded to
treatment, Smith said.

Kelly, who was graduated
from North Mecklenburg
High School, was considered
one of Smith's prime recruit:
ees when he entered David-

son last year. During the
‘Cats’ season opener last
week against VMI, Kelly
caught five passes for 45

yards and played both of-
fense and defense. He alter-
nated between split end and
flanker.

Davidson faces contests
with Furman and East Caro-
lina during Kelly's absence.

Smith said he will probab-

ly use junior Greg Cox and
sophomore George Hannen
for wide receivers in tomor
row’s battle with Furman.
Senior letterman Dick Lind-
sey will be called on to hold
down Kelly's defensive slot.
