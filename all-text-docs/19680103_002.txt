The President's
Impossible Job

When President D. Grier Martin walks out of his
office for the last time this June, the college will he
losing a man whose dedication to the college has been
demonstrated many times during his affiliation with
the Davidson community.

In his resignation he modestly credits everyone

but himself for the improvements that have been
‘made in the school during his tenure in office.

Few of those familiar with the college’s develop-
ment since 1958, however, would be willing to deny
him credit for its growth.

It is no mere coincidence that the physical plant
has been expanded greatly during these few years
Nor is it just a coincidence that the endowment has
doubled.

Martin was never one to be showy about his
accomplishments. Therefore, much of his work was not
recognized as being very spectacular. It was just taken
for granted that Martin would raise the money for
everyone’s pet dreams.

And he did. With the extremely able help of Rob-
ert Sailstad, director of public relations and develop-
ment, he was able to fight successfully in the increas-
ing competition for the educational dollar.

In addition to his ability to secure new funds,for
the college, Martin was very successful in finding the
most efficient allocation of the resources available to
the college.

Along with Robert Currie, treasurer and business
manager, Martin was able to stretch the college’s dol-
lar so that students could receive a better education
than that which is available at other schools with larg-
er endowments. ,

Martin was not ostentatious about these achieve-
ments. This modesty, however, was not the only
reason that he was not given all of the credit he de-
served. ‘

Recognition for the excellent job of administration
he performed for the college was often lost in charges
that the college lacked academic leadership.

Criticisms of this kind were more publicized than.

was praise of his administration. It was ill-treatment
of a man who worked tirelessly for the school.

The charges were true, but it was not the fault of
Martin or of Dean of the Faculty Frontis Johnston.
Ministering to the school’s immediate physical needs
is such a demanding job that it saps away the energies
that might have been otherwise devoted to academia.

Adoption of the Blue Sky Committee’s proposals
will not take care of the school’s academic needs. As
the college is presently organized, it is physically im-
possible for either the president or the dean of the
faculty to focus his energy on the constant review of
curriculum that is needed.

Therefore, when the trustees start their search
for a new president, they should consider just what it
is that they expect the president to do. If they want
someone to administer the college, that is a perfectly
desirable and necessary objective.

But they should try to help that man achieve that
goal by taking him out of a position where his worth
is short-changed by criticisms that he is not doing
something that is physically impossible for him to do.

Instead of being content to see a man work his
heart out for the school, trying to do something that
he should not be expected to do, the trustees should
create a position of provost or dean of the college. This
man would then have definite responsibility for the
job of providing what is nebulously termed “academic
leadership.”

President Martin was extremely interested in
students. Yet during his 10 years as president the
pressures of his work seldom left him time to go out
on the campus to see and talk to those students.

Creating the position of provost would make it
possible for the administrator to administrate without
subjecting him to unwarranted criticism.

The trustees will have enough trouble finding a
man to be as good a president of the college as Martin
has been without trying to put the new man into an
impossible job.
