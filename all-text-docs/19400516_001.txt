Wins Mark
Of Excellent

University of Tennessee
Major Inspects

Davidson's R. O. T. unit was
awarded the grade-of-excelience-at
the annual inspection held last Fri-
day, May 10, in’ Richardson stadium.

Physical drill, directed by Cadet
Major Sam Spencer, was the first
item on the program of the after-
noon. This was followed by a regu-
lar special parade, with the batal-
lion reviewed by the Davidson ba-
tallion staff.

At this time, the group went
through a special parade in honor
of the inspecting officer, Major
Hyde of the University of Tennes-
see. The batallion passed in review
before Major Hyde and Davidson’s
Lieutenant Colonel MacKenzie.

Immediately following the second
parade; the regular inspection took
place. The inspecting officer, ac-
companied by Cadet Colonel J. C.
Cooper, Cadet Major S. R. Spencer,
and Lieutenant Colonel MacKenzie,
passed through the ranks of each
campany. The inspector stopped be-
fore several men in each company
and asked various questions. These
questions consisted of such things

c

as_ the commander, of Davidson's
batallion, the president of. the col-

lege, the commander of the corps
area, and other items for which
the student is expected to be re-
sponsible.

After the actual inspection, the
various companies proceeded to do
their individual projects. Company
A, under Cadet Captain S. R. Ogles-
by, gave a demonstration of com-
pany close order drill. Company B,
under Cadet Captain John Kennedy,
staged the mock battle problem on
the golf course. The project was
under the direction of Lieutenant

Win In Final Ballots Book Written

By Two Betas

| Phi Alpha aided with the prepara-
tion of the history, which bears the
title “Milestones Backward Run,”
taken from a familiar Beta song.
Professor Chalmers Davidson, a
faculty brother, assisted with copy-
reading and proof correction.

~ The book traces the history of
Davidson’s oldest Greek brother-
hood from it$ founding here in 1858
up to the present time. It is the
result of much research into fra-
ternity and college archives, and is,
iso far as can be determined,

ten by undergraduates to date.
| Occasion for the history's
lication is the fiftieth anniversary
of Phi Alpha’s continuous existence
on the Davidson campus. The first
3eta chapter was killed by
Civil War and was not revived un-
til 1890.
