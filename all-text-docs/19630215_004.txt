Both Carrell and Spratt stated
that there will be a definite pro-
gram or forum on a campus is-
sue this semester. “Right now,
we are waiting for the outcome
of the trustee meeting which
will be held later this month,”
Carrell said. “We understand
that the trustees will vote on the
question of whether or not to
abolish the faculty oath. Lf they
decide to keep it, we might
have a very interesting program
to discuss the pros and cons of
it.” Spratt mentioned a debate
on the question of academic
freedom as a possible choice.

Societies Plan Ahead
For Spring Semester

Davidson’s literary societies are laying plans for

the spring semester.

Close at hand is participation
in the Hollins College Literary
Westival, which will take place
on Saturday, March 2 and whose
speakers will be William Styron,
Need Whittemore. Howard Ne-
merov, and William Meredith.

Any student from Davidson is
eligible to attend and should
contact Walt MacDonald, presi-
dent of Bu, if interested: those
hoping to have poems judged
must supply MacDonald with a
copy of their poems immediate-
ly,

For their campus activities
the societies hope to provide
new-ink in the pot with the
mnitiation of new members. Phi
and Eu each will bid 30 to 40
freshmen and upperclassmen on
Feb. 18, with initiation the fol-
lowing Monday.

Team Goes South,

Davidson's debate team will
leave Thursday morning to par-

The varsity team will consist
of Bob Llewellyn and Harry
Daniels for the affirmative and
Skip Jones and Bill Rule for the
negative. Jim Curl and George
Kuykendall will debate the af-
firmative for the freshmen;
Mike Harrington and Dave
Nieschan, the negative.

Or. T. F. Clark will judge
some of the events.

The topic will be the stand-
ard one for tournaments this
year: ‘Resolved: The Non-Com-
munist Nations should form an

economic community.” Sixty
teams from the southeast will
perticipate.

The teams may enter two

Instead of having full pro-
fessors take it before a com-
mencement audience, it would
be administered upon hiring.
Thus, in effect. every faculty
member hired, no matter what
his rank, would have to sub-
scribe to the oath.

Another anonymous mem-
ber of the faculty said thet
proponents of this measure
felt that too many of the
faculty ere either associate
or assistant professors and are
therefore untouched by the

Only about one-third of the

Martin catled the vote “a
survey of opinion among
members of the faculty.” He
said that a committee of three
men were chosen to evaluate
ths results of the poll, and
these results would be kept
fecret from even the other
faculty members until after
he presents them to the
trustees.

David Dakin "62
: In Accident |

David Dakin, Davidson Class
of 1962. died in an accident Feb |
2 while working on a canal near.
Houma, La.

Funeral services were held
Feb. 5 in Houston, Texas, where!
he lived with his parents Mr. |
and Mrs. Paul Dakin at 5309,
Bayou Glen.

While a student at Davidson,
Dakin was an active member of
Beta Theta Pi. Lettering three
years on the soccer team, he
was a member of the D Club. In
addition, he was a member of
Gamma Sigma Epsilon (Chemis-
try honorary).

The accident occurred when
Dakin fell from a piledriver
which he was operating for his
father's Houston Contracting
Company.

organizations around the world.

The Student Council could
find only three students who
were willing to attend the Model
General Assembly. which was
held at Chapel Hill this week.
The quota originally hoped for
was five. Schools from seven
southern states plus the Air
Force Academy sent representa-
tives to the assembly. Davidson
represented Portugal at the
meeting.

The Educational Travel Asso-
ciation is a regular travel agency
which features many tours
throughout the world at a re-
duced rate to students.

Dudley Salley, chairman of
the YMCA Committee on Na-
tional and Internetional Af-
fairs, coordinates the “Y”
program with the NSA and
the faculty Committee on In-
ternational Study. Any stud-
ent desiring fo travel or study
in Europe during the coming
symmer or next year can con-
tact Salley for information

- and aid in planning his trip.

Both Carrell and Spratt ad-
mitted that future plans of NSA
this spring are rather nebulous
at the present time. Carrell said
that an assembly program would
be presented, probably on
March 4, to stress the legisla-
tive ‘activity of the NSA last
summer at their annual con-

gress.

Spratt said that no referen-
dums on issues would be held
as are on some campuses. Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman's College,
for instance, holds student votes
on certain key issues to stimu-
late campus political interest
and to instruct their NSA rep-
resentatives how to vote at the
congress. He noted that the
Student Council would not in-
struct our representatives to the
congress how to vote.
