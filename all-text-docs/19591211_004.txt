This answer interested and
puzzied me. Then | realized
that it is the clothes that the
Davidson student wears that
make him so easily recogniz-
ed.

Probably the most character-
istic feature of the so-called
“Davidson Gentleman” is his
necktie, It is almost black or a
dark color with conservative
stripe or other design. This sea-
son the challis or foulard fabric
with a hand-blocked pattern is
especially popular. The knot for
the tie is usually the four-in-
hand of the half-windsor that
emphasizes the simplicity of the
tie.

The tie. fits around the tra-
ditional shirt of the Davidson
student. It is made of white or
pin-striped oxford cloth. With-

is buttoned rather than. being

are also in the process of pack-'

The Davidson man some-
times wears a suit, but more
familiar is the dark sport
coat harmonizing with black
pants. The sporty coat is of
wool tweed skillfully cut with

| narrow lapels, three buttons

in front, and little or no

shoulder padding. An import-
ant accessory is the fraternity
monogram pinned through
the buttonhole of the lapet.

Slim in the legs, the pants
are of wool flannel and do not

break over the shocs. There
are no pleats in the front, and
the straps and buckle are in the
back. The belt worn with these
pants is of a dark leather of the
same fabric as the tic.

The shoes are of two kinds,
shell cordovans or loafers in
black or brown. They are kept
shiny by the pledges of the
fraternity to which the David-
son man bclongs, and contrast
well with the white socks that
are worn on_uall but the most
formal occasions.

The Davidson gentieman is
usually hatiess on even the
coldest days. His hair is trim-
med short and is styled to be
brushed rather than combed.
This is an influence of the
reguiremonts for close - cut
hair of the ROTC brigade.

Therefore, clothes make the
man and the correct clothes
make the “Davidson Gentle-
man.”

“Weni, widi, Winston!” Thus did Caesar
(a notoriously poor speller) hail the discovery
of Filter-Blend—light, mild tobaccos specially
selected and specially processed for filter smoking.

He knew that a pure white filter
alone is not enough. To be a com-
plete filter cigarette, it must have
Filter-Blend up front. And only

Winston’s got it!

That’s why Caesar would never
accept another brand even when it
was offered gratis. In fact, history

tells us he’d glower at the extended

pack and sneer, “Et tu, Brute?’
In a stirring peroration to his

legions, Caesar put it this way:

“For the Numeral I filter ciga-

rette—for the best-tasting filter
cigarette—for the noblest filter
cigarette of all—smoke Winston!”

“Winston tastes good like a cigarette should!”
