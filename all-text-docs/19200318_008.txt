task and to put himself wholly to
its accomplishment.
unday Morning.

The Sunday morning exercises of
the convention opened at 10 o’clock
with Mr. J. Lovell Murray, intro-
ducing the speakers. Miss Hardy
opened the meeting by a devotional
service of scripture and prayer Miss
Hazlett explained the meaning of
the volunteer pledge. Its chief
object was to get men and women
to sign up as foreign missionaries.

Dr. Murray delivered the address
of the morning. He told of the
great need of foreign missionary
workers in all the heathen lands.
He explained that one need nut go
preach only, but volunteers were
;needed to teach the people how to
‘farm and carry on commercial m-
| dustries. He urged the volunteers
‘to be careful about signing the
‘pledge. He said that one should not
_be too hasty, as it was a scrious
matter. However, Mr. Murray sug-
gested that those who had already
carefully considered the matter, and
i who had made their decision should
' sign the pledge; others should think
lover the matter and then sign it.
| The need was the only call that any
one should require to beckon him to
iforeign missionary service.

Sunday Night.

The last service, held Sunday
night, was in some respects the
most helpful and by far the most
beautiful service of the entire con-
ference.

First came the’echoes from the
Des Moines Convention. The ques-

‘tions which every volunteer must
janswer were presented to the con-
‘ference. The volunteers learned of
‘the bigness of the task and of the
icomparative small size of the force
;at work, of the great necessity of
the personal challenge which comes
,to each Christian as well as each
volunteer from the heathen world.

The best part of the conference |
was certainly saved to the last, Dr.
Richards in his address struck the
keynote of the whole conference:.
“We are now” he said “on one of
the mountain tops of our lives and |
we can see the delectable mountains
of glory but between them and us|
are the valleys.” This view should |
be carried with every one into the!
valleys of their respective school,
work and the work in the foreign |
field. Man cannot always stay on
the heights but must descend into
valleys.

Dr. Richards closed by saying one.
should volunteer now that he might
properly prepare himself.

Y. M. C. A. Reception.

It was indeed the pleasure of the
¥. M. C. A Cabinet to be the hosts |
of a most enjoyable reception in'
honor of the visiting delegates from |
the Student Volunteers, attending
the State Convention, held in the:
gymnasium building, Saturday after-
noon at four-thirty.

The building was very neatly dec-
orated in red and black. Punch
bowls were placed at the eritrance
hall door and in each end of the
large room. Delicious punch and
cakes were served by the very at-
tractive girls from the conference
and town; Miss Emma Jackson of
Meredith College, Raleigh, N. C.;
Misses Mary Parks Grey and Doro-
thy Finlayson of Davidson, N. C.;
assisted by Messrs. Dwight Chal-
mers, B. W. Romefelt and Lewis
Schenck, of Davidson College.

Practically the entire student
body also a number of the faculty
members and their wives were pres-:
ent and were introduced to

charming visitors from the various
colleges in the state. It was a very
informal occasion. Everyone was
Tequested to wear a little card stat-
ing their name and college. In this
; way all those present soon became
acquainted with each other and
mutually indulged in a general good
time.

Music was furnished throughout
the affair by Mr. D. R. Freeman’s
famous Marimbo Band and added
greatly to the pleasures of the after-
noon,

During the last few minutes of
the delightful occasion, the David-
son boys formed a circle and sang
their college spirit song O! David-
son, It was indeed one of the most
enjoyable receptions of the year.
