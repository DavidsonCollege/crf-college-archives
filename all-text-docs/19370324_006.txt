At New Sport

Sloans linament for horses
and for family use has hit a
new high in sales during the
past week at local drug stores.

The liniment hasn’t been bought
for the horses, cither, but for the
riders, for in case you don't already
know it, horseback riding is the
newest student last
fortnight.

So, when next you see someone
some slight replica of “Jug Head”
Johnston's renowned legs, you can

craze for’ the

safely draw the conclusion that
somebody's been riding Mr. Joe
Craig’s nice little gentle pony

“Flash.” Oh, yes, didn’t you know
why all the ladies—even the little
kids all ride “Flash?” ‘Cause he’s so
gentle, oh yes, he’s a_ nice little
horse. Yeah, Earle Sande MIGHT
enjoy riding “Flash!” :

“Flash,” just one fourteen
“gentle little ponies,” happens to be
an ex-polo-pony—and boy, can he
STOP! The rider (Tom Corbin es-
pecially included), just sits tight,
sometimes, when the four leg brakes
are applied and then the fun be-
gins—the equestrian (?) takes
about three good bounces and then
tries to stay in the saddle.

Mr. Craig will tell you that Will
Rogers rode “Flash” in a polo game
once: Tom Corbin will tell you that
it wasn’t a merry-go-round horse
that he rode.

Now the very height of docility,
says Mr. Craig, is Nancy, a nice old
sway-back mare. Ovid Bell will
give you fine references for Nancy
because he can ride Nancy without
keeping his feet in the stirrups and
somewhat resembles. the well -
known “bouncing ball,” and too, he
likes to look like Ichabod Crane
coming to town. A

Jack Branch made the fatal
“faux-pas” of getting a small size
saddle and his cup overfloweth. But
“White Lady,” Mr. Craig’s prize
five gaiter, offered a challenge
which the Wooly West in Branch
couldn't resist. The only casualty
for that afternoon was a pair of
breeches, which, unfortunately got
the seat ripped out.. White Lady,
bless her soul, has a cute new step
but it looks like the boys are go-
ing to have to take “Skunky” Pe-
ters out to tell them whether it’s
the “Charleston” the “Shelby
Roundhouse.”

J. C. Crowell and fair Lady Gam-
mon had a lovely time out at Mr.
Craig’s last Saturday afternoon. If
it, just ask

of

or

you don't believe
Crowell.

The stables go under the name of
the Colonial Riding Academy and
it is located at Croft, if you know
where that is, and if you don't, it’s
about eleven miles from Davidson
on the Charlotte highway.

KING 1 CONDUCTOR
OF SMING SESSION

Orchestra Gives Prelude To
Dances in Chapel

The Junior class gave a boost to
the advertisement of the Junior-
Speaking dances and also a very
entertaining program by present-
ing “Chubby” King and his Dav-
idson Swingsters last Friday in
chapel.

To begin the program Jim Dor-

sett rushed down the middle aisle
to “Chubby’s” seat and presented
two telegrams to him. The maestro
arose from his seat, took off his
overcoat, and to the astonishment
of all revealed that he was attired
in white tie and tails “Then he
strode down th@aisle, ascending the
steps to the stage, and when the
thundering applause had died down,
he read the two telegrams. The
first was from Myrna Loy, who
expressed her profuse regrets that
she would not be able to attend the
dances, but that she was previously
“tied up.” The second, from Sally
Rand, read: “Dear Chump, accept
offer to present floor show at Jun-
ior-Speaking dances. Offer new rou-
tine including sensational. dance
minus my usual bubbles. Love and
kisses, Sally.”
“Chubby” then gave a short talk
telling the boys what was waiting
for them during the week-end at
the dances and then his very mel-
odic orchestra beat out two good
numbers, the dashing “Swamp
Fire” and the sentimental “You're
Laughing at Me.”

“BUCK” CURRIE SPEAKS

nouncing publicly his new beliefs.
However, as soon as he saw Christ's
vicarious sacrifice on the cross,
he hastened to Pilate, announced
his conversion and asked to be al-
lowed to bury His Master’s body.

Thursday evening the minister
asserted that there was little more
light in the world than in Jesus’
day, in spite of all the material de-
velopment since then. The only
way men can learn how to fulfill
the command to be lights of the
world is to follow the example of
Jesus, who also was the light. He
was always able to think above the
low line of prejudice, and he show-
ed that ability when he led the dis-
ciples into the land of the degener-
ate Gadarenes. Prejudice, accord-
ing to Mr. Currie, is still today a
besetting sin of Christians,

Christ was a light of the world
also in that He revealed to man-
kind the value of the soul. He was
interested in all men, because no
matter how sinful they were they
all had souls. Lastly, Christ gave
light to the world by revealing to
men the heart of God. He was re-
vealing God’s heart when He went
to the Cross. The world could see
more of Christ if Christians were
willing to risk and suffer some-
thing, in order to reveal Him better.

Mr. Currie’s sermons on Sunday
morning and evening were not parts
of the series which composed the
spring services. His themes then
were “Prepare to meet thy God,”
and “Calvary.”

world lose its sorriness and baa
rich. “What better field,” asked
Rev. Currie, “could we give our
lives to than the service of the
church. Christ thought this work
worthy of his blood. The church
today needs a re-enlistment of sac-
rificial blood.”

Rey. “Buck” Currie closed his se-
ries of sermons to the students of
Davidson by saying that a man’s
religion doesn’t mean much to him
unless he has sacrificed and suf-
fered for his religion's sake. “Can
the world see any blood on your
faith?”

For the first time in the history
of the Davidson broadcasts, the
presentation took place from the
basement instead of the auditorium
of Chambers building, and was done
as an experiment at the suggestion
of WBT engineers.

CENTENNIALS CHOOSE

victory almost uncontested by any
of his classmates for this, honor.
Ken had 52 out of 75 votes cast for
12 men.

Most In Love

Bob Johnston came out on top
by five votes but Russell Patterson
and Walt Dickson were pushing
him hard all the way. Bill Quick
and Bill. Brown were also strong
contenders.

Best Athlete

Bill Quick won with a good ma-
jority over eleven other men. Dick
Johnson and Ed Armfield were his
closest rivals. Peabody, Jim John-
ston and Tom Corbin followed in
that order.

Profondest Proboscis

L. K. “Snozz”’ Hill, living up to
his handle, won the greatest victory
in the whole poll by taking 70 out
of 78 votes cast for only three men.
Joe Hunter and Tom Breeden were
the only men who so much as dared
enter the race.

Laziest

H. T. “Pinky-Puss” Mills, Tom
Corbin, and “Colonel” Carl Groover
came in as named, but Pinky had
a hard time winning.

Ugliest

Jim Johnston just did beat out
Bobby Peters for this position.
Carl Carlson and Ed Armfield, al-
though not next, turned in a good
account of themselves.

L. K. Hill received a greater to-
tal of votes than any other senior
with 73 to his credit. Harold Sugg
is next with a total of 66, then is
Ken Scott with 54, followed by Bill

Quick with 42, Wilbur Edwards 38,
Jack Branch, Roy Bigham and Jim
Johnston were all well up in the
thirties.

For supér-superlatives we have
Wilbur Edwards and Jack Branch
neck and neck as they both placed
in 7 columns with a higher average
vote than anyone. else.

Harold Sugg had more votes in
more than one column than any
other Senior.

This poll expresses the opinion
of slightly more than fifty per cent
of the Seniors with 79 signed bal-
lots out of a class of 147. &

PAGEANT WORK

actual number of costumes may
come close to 1000, many of the ac-
tors appearing in more than one
scene.

Mr. Viehman expressed enthusi-
asm after his research work. “The
history of Davidson is much fuller
than appears at first glance,” he
remarked. “At the start I supposed
a month or so would be sufficient

for writing the production, but the
time easily lengthened into three
months.”

He stated that this is one of the
most interesting historical pageants
he has worked on. Among other
productions of this type that Mr.
Viehman has written and directed
is the University of Alabama’s cen-
tennial pageant presented in 1931.
He also directed the Four Nations
peace celebration at Niagara Falls
in 1934, and the Yorktown sesqui-
centennial in 1932.
