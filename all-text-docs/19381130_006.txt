course, the football teams kept

quite a number of boys running to

and an occasional brokeft bone of
minor concern.

The students who weren't up to
par at the first physical examina-

will be given re-examinations. The
most serious illness has been an
attack of appendicitis. The subject
was operated on successfully and is
now recovering rapidly.

There are an average of twenty

occasion there was a total of forty

He also named several other
men who are now prominent at
that institution: Dr. Fredrick Bliss,
Dr. Fisher, Dr. Nelson Glick.

Dr. Burroughs then proceeded to
explain the process of archaeology,
which he defined as “that branch
of history which studies ancient
life by observing the things that
the people used.” There are three

ology.

to

First, the stratigraphic method of
digging must be used in order to
prevent the loss or injury to the
property and materials that are
being unearthed. Second, there
must be a careful observation and
cataloging of every object taken
out of the excavating materials.
Third, these articles that have been
discovered must be interpreted and
compared With other findings.

It was shown that very often the
different selections of arts discov-
ered are not very beautiful in the
esthetic sense; however, they are
invaluable in the archaeological re-

search. Through different branch-

es of art, the ideas of the people
and the modes of life of the nations
can be deciphered. Even the small-
est section of pottery bearing the
smallest inscription or picture is
treasured by the archaeologist, for
it may hide some very important
matter.

Then some slides shown

in this was shown the remarkable
likeness of certain sections of that
country today with certain sections
in Biblical times. The lecture was
closed by Dr. Burroughs saying
that he hopes the world will re-
main settled and peaceful in order
that further study may be carried
out in this field of work and in all
others.
