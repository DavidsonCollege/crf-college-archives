Neisler and Sparrow were the stars
for the Seniors, Neisler being especially
good in backing up the line. Pickens,
Nimocks and Johnson excelled for the
Fresh.

FRESH-SOPH GAME.

The Fresh and Sophs tied in a slow
foot ball game Monday evening. The
Sophs outplayed the Fresh throughout
the whole game, keeping the ball in their
territory most of the time. The gaining
of both teams was spasmodic, and neither
was able to advance at the critical mo-
ment. The first quarter ended with the
ball in the Soph’s possession in the mid-
dle of the field.

In the second quarter the Sophs had
their first chance to score. By blocking
a punt and Finley’s recovery they had

the ball on the Fresh 10-yard line. The |,

Fresh tightened up and the Sophs were
unable to gain.

The third quarter ended with the ball
on the Fresh 30-yard line. In the fourth
quarter the Sophs seemed to have found
a little of their old-time “pep,” and
rushed the ball to the Fresh 10-yard line
The Fresh again tightened up here and
held. On the third dow Johnson in
tercepted a forward pass, returning tc
yards.

Stars for the Sophs were: Shaw and
Worth. and for the Fresh: Monteith
and Johnson.
