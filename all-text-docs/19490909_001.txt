IMPORTANCE OF Y. MC. A

The Young Men's Christian Association is probably the most
active student organization on the campus. Affiliated with the
National YMCA and composed of the students themselves, it
seeks to carry on a prograni of religious services, social fellow-
ship, and recreation in the student body, to provide appropriate
chaunels  throvgh which — the

energies of the students may be
brought to bear in usefpl. work
on the community, and to identify
the Davidson student body with
worthwhile causes of a national
and international nature, all built
on the structure of Christian prin.
ciples.

The YMCA depends for its sup-
port and leadership on the student
body. It is financed by the students
almost entirely. ts officers are
elected by the student body and
all its-services are a result of stu.
dent body interest: and participa-
tion.

For the year, 1949.1950, its of-
ficers will be Jim Evans, treasurer;
Neil Leach and Tommy Langford,
vice presidents; and Bill Alexander,
president.

port of the administration and the
Rey. William R. (Bill) Smith who
will serve again as general secre-
tary. The YMCA's officers and
especially its general secretary, al-
ways welcome fellow students con-
ferring with them on the “Y"’ work.

A cabint of about twenty men
carries on the brunt of arranging
the Y's activities which vary from
ping-pong to preaching on deputa.
tions. This cabinet in conference
with the general officers and gen-

-eral secretary make the major de.|

cisions on progrants and activities.
Each cabinet member is responsi-
ble for coordinating the work of
his own department. A’ ‘student-
faculty Board of Control formu.
lates general policy.

One glance at the cabinet will
reveal the multifarious activities of
the YMCA: The YMCA sponsors
a College Bible Class which meets
at the “Y" every Sunday morning
after coffee and donuts aré served.
This department ‘is headed by Bob
Gay, while Randy Taylor coordi-
nates the prayer meeting services,
held in each dormitory every
Wednesday night. Ushers at Sun-
day night vespers work under
Stubby Evans and special services
speakers are arranged by John
Lyles.

Teachers for Sunday School ex.
tension work, deputations: to
churches in the near-by vicinity,
Boy Scout and boy's club coun-
selors are under the supervision of
Irving Stubbs, Don Shriver, Bruce
Davis, and Lonnie Turnipseed, re.
spectively. York Pharr establishes
« workable connection between the
YMCA and the colored community
énterprises.

Publicity and the editing of the
Handbook is in charge of Newton
Robertson and the department
handling inter-racial conferences
is headed by Chic Longenecker.
The department of social activities
which arranges “days” with girls’

_ schools is headed by Bill Klein. In
connection with this department
the YMCA makes available for stu-
dent
the YMCA lounge and ping-pong
and pool rooms.

This year the YMCA cabinet
will be organized around four com-
missions: Faith and worship, with
Tommy Langford as chairman;
social activity, Nei! Leach; com-
munity service, Dave Anderson, and
world-relatedness, Curtis Harper.
The. latter will include the Christ-
mas Gift Fund and various confer-
ences. Also in the cabinet are
President of the Student Body Whit
Cobb, representing student govern.
ment, and Mac Erwin, who will
serve as Freshman Advisor.

In cooperation with Mr. Erwin,
a@ number of YMCA Cabinet men
wili assist with orientation.

The YMCA would like to solicit
student body participation and sup-
port and to emphasize that each
student feel a part of the YMCA
and a responsibility for its success.
A personal appeal is made to each
freshman to use the Y’s facilities
and to get into Y work.

3 College Dances

lt is high time to begin thinking
about the three most important]
dates of the school year. If you
haven’t wiven these dates the ut-
most position in your academic
agendum, you had best hurry while
there is still time. Everyday letters
are rolling into the. neighboring
towns and villages with pleas that
these datés might be accepted by
the unusual creatures called wo-
men. Since there is a shortage of
true feminine beauty, we would ad-'
vise you to write at your earliest.

Davidson is striving to uphald its

reputation as the Country Club of
North Carolina, Though attempts
have been made to make learning
the important phasé of college tife,
we still put social life at the top,
Three dates have been set to prove
to the unbelievers that campus
social life is the’ staff.of life. Home-
coming will soon be here with its
rain and football game and ‘it is
rumored that V.M.I.’s Johnny Long
will furnish the music: After Home-| one of the most significant periods
coming will come midwinters with} of its history. October of 1948
marked the Leginning of a cam-
paign tu raise $2,500,000, the mini
mum amount that will be needed
to carry out Davidson's Develop-
ment Program. The needs of the
college are obvious: The new gym-
nasium, a new college church, re-
conditioning of campus buildings,
and aft increased endowment.

Last fall Davidson launched into

its hoped for snow and warm auto-

arlotte will set us to sway with
his jungle beat. Then with the re-
birth of nature will come Spring

spotlight at this dance and hopes
for a romantic summer. Perhaps
Les Brown wilt bless us with his

Eleven New Men

on Davidson Faculty

Though all of the professors at
Davidson are new to you, it is possi.

ble to obtain information through
the medium of the catalogue and

upperclassmen concerning the ones

who have been here for years. The
purpose of this article is to intro-

duce you to the new faculty mem-
bers.

Dr. George A. Douglas, after ob-
taining the degrees of A. B. from
the University of Michigan, Ph. M.,
from the University of Wisconsin,

place avhere it must either, slowly
retire into a smaller and less sig-
nifjeant role as an educational insti-
tution or must continue 10 develop
as one of the great colleges of the
South and of America.

The decisive factor in her de.
velopment is’ whether or .not she
can have the buildings and endow-
ment that this second century of
services requires. To secure this
minimum sum of $2,500,000, a fre-
mendous organization, both in
quality and numbers, was set Up,
with one hundred fifty-eight men
.and women in selected key positions.

so fast, friend, you're no Davidson
raan—yet! You're a freshman. Take
a look at that picture—yeah, that
one close to where you're reading.
Know who that is? Thats you! Not
quite the picture Joe College had
of himself, huh?

Snafu of college life. A refugee
from a biology lab. You're the one
who stalks into the ROTC .puild-

ganist and pianist, comes to David-
son from Grand Rapids Michigan

to be an associate professor of
music,

Davidson Launches Into One of
Significant Periods Of Her History

The progress and cffectiveness of
this group is manifested in the near-
completed gymnasium which stands
at the north end of Richardson
Fieht. This one otructure in a majer
step in bringing the school’s build-
ings and equipment up to date. It
will offer to the Davidson student,
athletic equipment and accomoda-
tions as modern and as complete
as any in the South. Favorable
weather has allowed work to run
ahead of schedule and this year’s

homecoming festivities are to center

about the dedication of the edifice
in October.

Although no ground has been
broken for the new church, it is
no longer merely a dream. Plans
for it have already been drawn up
and its imposing spire is expected
to impress passers-by before many
months.

ects which are of less significance

Graduation Fosted

College officials are always
answering the question, “Well what
subjects should | take in order
to be sure lal graduate with a
anajor in my chosen field?” Each
student asks such a question many
times before he is handed his di.
ploma. Perhaps the question is

ix helpful advice. If you plan to
enter the wiinistry, teaching, en-
gineering, medicine, or commercial
scientific work, write to your pre-
jerred graduate school and get
straight NOW ‘the requirements
needed for admission there. Then
plan your college courses accord-

ingly.
For requirements for a Bachelor's
Degree (A.B. or B.S.) please

check your college catalog. A mini-
mim of 122 semester hours is re,
quired for. graduation, and, further-
more a minimum of 122 “quality
pdints’* in accordance with the fol.
lowing table is necessary:

“A—three points for each semes-
ter hour credit.

“B"-—two points for each semes-
ter hour credit.

languages begun in the freshman
year must be continued through the
sophomore year. A student major-
ing in the Languages must major
in one of the languages taken in
his freshman or sophomore year.

Suggested Majors

For ministeral students: English,
Hible and Religion, Philosophy,
History, or Classic Languages.

Ministerial students are urged to
varv théir courses, thereby receiv-
ing a broader and more general
backgroynd outside their major re.
quirements.

For medical sudents: Chemistry,
Biology.

Such majors require long hours:
of lab work, therefore other activ-
ities should be planned accordingly.

For law students: Political
Science.

Such a major requires as a minor
very broad and encompassing
courses.

For education students: Psychol.
ogy and Education, English, His-
tory, or Languages.

The pre-teaching student should
vary his courses to make a good
general education beyond his major.

For Business Students: Economics
and Business.

No matter what your major
might be, make sure that sufficient
attention is given to other courses
outside the major requirements.
The need for well-rounded educa-
tion is one that cannot be over:
looked.

Consult your faculty and student
advisors concerning your choice of
courses. The college catalog is al.
ways handy for reference.

Alabama, and West Virginia.

In spite of the increased number
ofsthe Freshman Class, the total
enrolment at Davidson has. de-
creased. There are fifty-seven less
students this year than last. This
leaves the enrollment at school this
year at approximately 900. The
enrollment is slowly settling down
to prewar levels, which in the minds
of the administration, is necessary
to continue the same spirit and
efficiency which has always pre-
vailed on the campus.

College Encourages
Outside Activities

Davidson College offers a wide
range of extra-curricular ‘activities
‘to ali her students. Freshmen en-
tering this Fall are urged to select
one or more of these activities,
because in doing so they will en.
rich and enhance their stay at
Davidson. At each turn of the year,
you, the class of '53, will find the,
activity of your choice more in-
teresting, and in your senior year it
will be you who keep the wheels
turning.”

The largest single field is that
of publications, The Davidsonian is
the weekly newspaper, and each
year many freshmen begin work in
either the editorial or the business
departments. An opportunity will
be given all those who are interested
at a special meeting to. be called
early in the year. Other publications
are the Annual and the Scripts ard
Pranks, the school magazine. Men
who show excellence in any of
these fields are usually asked to
join one or more of the three lit-
terary organizations on the campus.

These literary societies, Sigma
Upsilon, Philanthropic Literary
Society and FEwmanean Literary

Society are honorary societies, and
to receive a bid you must. be
chosen by thegmembers and ap-
proved by the faculty advisors.

-Other honorary societies are the
German Club, Spanish , Club,
French Club, Chemistry Fraternity,
Vhysics Fraternity and the Ath-
letic Fraternity. All these are availa.
ble only by bids and then aniy if
you excel in that particular field.

Those interested in world afiairs
may join the International Rela-
tions .Clab or, become a member of
the World Federalists.

The dramatics club. the Red and
Black Masquers, welcome fresh.
men who show an interest in that
field. It is an active group. which
turns out one outstanding per-
formance a year.

The YMCA offers a wide variety
of jobs and positions. Men are
needed to teach Sunday schools in
Davidson and also in near-by com.
munities. Many serve as coaches for
local schools, directing any and all
sports in season.

Freshmen interested in music may
enter any of the numerous musical
organizations on the campus. We
are fortunate in having an excellent
department here at our disposal,

Besides a varied athletic pro-
gram some boys will be interested
in the rifle team which wins its
share of the matches each year.

All of these groups welcome
Freshmen into their midst and will
be more than glad to hel, them off

to a good start.
