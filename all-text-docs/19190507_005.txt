What the “Y” Has

Done for Davidson} Wildcat’s Biggest Asset
Has Won Recognition from All Over

A Brief Outline“of the Year’s Work.
Success Due Largely to Mr. Miles.

Under the leadership of our livewire
secretary, Mr. Robert Miles, the Y. M.
C. A. at Davidson has experienced the
most successful year in its history.

During the term of the §. A. T. C.
the headquarters, at the gymnasium.
were supplied with magazines, music and
citipment for the various indoor games.
‘This-term a picture machine has been in-
s'alled which has been in operation
tvice each week. This form of recrea-
ticn has been very popular, as shown by
the average ttendance of 275 students.

The work in the Sunday morning Bi-
be classes, vesper services and the world
forum have been very successful. Ap-
rroximately 700 pamphlets for study in
these phases of Bible and National work

lave been distributed among the fellows.

The texthook “About Jesus,” by Bos-
orth, which has been used in some of
tke army camps, has been helpful, and
Mr. Miles hopes by next year to have
some pamphlets on the practical prob-
lems of the day, to be studied along with
the regular literature on this work. The
z*tendance in these classes has averaged
abeut 125,men each Sunday.

Great work has been accomplished in
the district Sunday Schools, The stu-
dents have conducted six schools every
Sunday afternoon, and the interest and

attendance has continued to grow each
week. The average attendance of these
f-r the term is around 225. A few
rhase of this work is that of maintain-
irz a playground for the children of
the mill district of the town
‘york has been under the management
cf D. W. Roberts, and has proved a
wonderful success.

The vesper services have been one of
the chief stimulae to the men at David-
en. At these meetings, our secretary.
various members of the faculty, and
leaders and teachers from all parts of
the country, have spoken to the men.
All these talks have been on subjects
that confront college students and have
exerted a wonderful influence for good
among the fellows. The attendance at
these services has been exceptionally
reed, averaging about 175 for the term
and over 200 for the year.

This is the first year that Davidson
l:as been fortunate to have such a man
a: Mr. Miles as a leader, and with such
a successful year just coming to a close,
there is great hope for more abundant
success in the future.

Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, May 7, 1919

“Railroad” Clarke

the State.

Despite the fact that young Clark’s
average for the season is only four hun-
dred, yet this does not by any means
give an accurate account of his ability.
He seemed to be a hard luck pitcher, as
the pames he lost were by the one scare
margin. He lost to Elon College 3 to
1, in spite of the fact that he held his
opponents to six scattered hits and
striking out eighteen men. Another de-
feat marked up against him was the
game with University of North Caro-
jina that went fifteen innings 4 to 3.
In this game the ‘Var Heels could only
gather’ six hits during the entire: fray,
but luck broke against him at every
turn. In the last game of the season
he lost to ‘Trinity 2 to 1, thirteen in-
nings, although he only allowed three
clean hits. But in two games “Rail-
road” covered himself with glory, Vir-
ginia found his delivery quite bewilder-
ng, and as a result three safe swats is
all that he allowed them, besides send-
‘na back to the bench thirteen men via
the strike-out route. Against A. & E.
he landed a thirtcen-inning contest 1
to o. ‘This was undoubtedly the best
plaved game of the season.

“The Nev's and Observer” of Raleigh
clases C'ark as one of the best two
pitchers in the State, but give him a
hitting team and he would excell by far
any other college twirler in North Caro-
lina. Clark has received an offer from
Jack Dunn, of the Baltimore Orioles,
which he has refused. as he does not
care to play professional ball. Clark is
a senior this year, consequently he will
leave a vacancy on the team that Coach
parer is going to find mighty hard to
ill.
