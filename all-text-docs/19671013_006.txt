Dave Dunn, junior: “‘The question
is opinionated. It's up to the person
as to the type of social life he wants.
It's not U.Va.. but vou shouldn't. be
here if that’s what you want. How.
ever, five weekends for the freshmen
are not enough. There is nothing else

for them t6 do.”

Robert Corbett, sophomore:

There's no real organization for them.
The Union's mixers have been pretty
good. but if they could come up with
a few more combos, .about three a
month, it would be a lot better. Per-
haps they could come up with some-.,
thing new and different, I wouid really
like this.”

Tom Earnhardt, senior: “Although ~
I have been known to leave campus
on a number of ‘off weekends.’ it’s not
for a lack of something to do. I've
had a great time at several of the

even better. I just wish there were a

to C. Shaw Smith. director
of the College Union.

“The three Pickle Brothers
have just recently made a
pilot film in Hollywood, and
have since then received sev-

said. ‘‘They felt that it was in
their best interest to cancel
the tour which would have
brought them here. Their
performance at Davidson has
not been re-scheduled at this

In other action, the council
discussed the possibilities of
a freshman chapel! and hall
discussions to acquaint fresh-
men with the mechanics of
the rush system and to en-
able them to have a broader
understanding of the rush
system in general.

The IFC also approved its
new budget of $1.725. The

with a $1 pledging fee.

The 13-year-old youth was
picked up by police first.

In addition. several plant
improvements have been
made possible through Ford

major improvement was the
remodeling in 1966 of Cham-
bers Building auditorium,
which was named in honor
of J. Spencer Love, the late
textile executive who served
as'a Davidson trustee for 12
years. His widow. Mrs. Love

Another speaker, Miss De

John Thacker. a Davidson
sophomore. Marcelo Rosero,
Novoa and Ortega. members
of PRAM from South Amer-
ica. related their impressions
of conditions and attitudes in
both continents.

The South American speak
ers are members of a larger
PRAM group which came to
Davidson for the last several
days of a two month tour
they took of the United
States. .

The Project of the Amer-
icas (PRAM) is an organiza-
tion devoted to the free inter-
change of persons and ideas
between the two American
continents. It was founded at
Davidson in 1965, and its na-
tional headquarters is still
located here.

Rosero said that the peo-
ple of Ecuador and of much
of the rest of South America
had lost sight of the fact that
their people are rich in intel-
lectual and artistic talents
but have lost their initiative
due to long years of oppres-
sion and poverty.

Ortega, the leader of the
group, charged that the Unit-
ed States attempts to impose
its way of life on any small
nation which shows any in-
dication of possibly adopting

communist ideas.

Housing Poll Raises
Gripes, Suggestions

‘Phe house shakes at least
five times a night.”

"No bath tub.” “Dirty.”
“Don’t make them out of
cardboard.’ These were. typ
ical comments made by mar
ried students in a Student
Council questionnaire on
housing. Nineteen out of 30
have replied in an effort to
prompt the college to secure
modern housing at low cost.

Rent varies from $44-90.50

a month. but most couples
felt that it was reasonable.
Yet statements describing
the living quarters showed
dissatisfaction with the ap-
pearance and the filth of the
houses, the plumbing, the gas
heating. and poor mainte-
nance.

Everyone expressed con-
cern about the situation even
though not all the deficien-
cies applied to them. The

majority felt that the col
lege should greatly subsidize
housing either by building
low-rent apartments or by
buying more old homes and
fixing them up better. Other
suggestions were that the
college help in providing fur
niture or set aside a trailer
camp.

One couple said: ‘‘We feel
that the college should sub
sidize the building of proper

living quarters for married
students. We don’t. appreci-
ate being treated like a prob-
lem. that, if ignored. will go
away.”’

Student Body President
Tom Earnhardt said. ‘‘Mar-
ried students generally did
an excellent job in filling out
the questionnaires. I think
this great care probably in-
dicates a very real concern
about the housing situation.”
