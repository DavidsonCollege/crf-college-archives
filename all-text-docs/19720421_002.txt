The Davidsonian

Students Faced With Housing Neglect

AN ANALYSIS
By TODD EADES
Contributing Editor

There is a problem in mar-
ried student housing. The col-
lege provides few facilities for
married students, who often face
considerable trouble in finding
suitable living accomodations.
Housing is often a considerable
distance from campus, thus al-
ienating married students phy-
sically as well as socially.

The college is geared for the
single student who resides in the
residence halls. and despite its
commitment to the residential

college concept, it has done lit- ‘

tle in the past to assist married
students in their particular
needs.

The college has a minimum
of four units to rent to married
students and a maximum of sev-
en to eight units, depending on
faculty need. There are pre-
sently 39 married students liv-
ing off campus.

These units are of inferior
quality. Jackson Heights, nick-
named Cardboard Village, was
constructed after World War II.

The most important question
concerns the college's respon-
sibility towards married student
housing. Unfortunately this re
mains unanswered. .

Director of Student Housing
Scotty Nicholls has mixed feel-
ings about the college’s respon-
sibility towards married stu-
dents’ housing, and is not sure
that the college has a tremen-
dous responsibility. Nicholls does
believe that Davidson as a res-
idential college has a certain
responsibility that it now neg-
lects.

There have been several stu-
dent-initiated studies done. One
of the first was by Fbil Hazel
as a president of the Married
Student Association in the fall
of 1968. He presented the prob-
jem of the married student,
which included financial and
emotional problems and the lack
of adequate counseling as well
as housing.

“Housing is a universal pro-
blem. Bad housing is a _ con-

stant irritant. More important,
the location of the housing may
determine whether or not the
couple finds a satisfactory group
of friends, or has much of a re-
lationship to the campus. Hous-
ing is a basic method of social
structuring,”” he found.

Tom Robertson presented a
study of five alternatives on
married student housing to the
SGA in May 1970. Robertson
advocated that the college pro-
vide land and build an apart-
ment complex to house married
students.

It was desirable that this be
on campus, Robertson said and
quoted Hazel's report, ‘‘Housing
is very much related to the pro-
blem of belonging. Married stu-
dents do not belong anywhere.
not with single undergraduates.
not with faculty, nor with towns-
people. There is no built-in com-
munity to which they automati
cally belong.”

Robertson continued, ‘‘The
college may even come to re-
alize that these students, previ-
ously alienated, may have a very
real contribution to make to
campus life.”

The ost exhaustive = study
done was an extended studies
project by Michael Johnson pre
sented to Dr. Robert Avinger
last fall. Johnson did a demand
study of married student hous-
ing. Its conclusions were ‘that
tuere exists a demand for 15 to
20 new units to house Davidson
College married students. ‘Tne
data indicates that at least 50
per cent of the units need to be
two-bedroom dwellings.

The units need not be © :thin
walking distance of the college,
although such close proximity
would be highly desirable. The
type of dwellings is not wo sig
nificant. but single family units
are preferred.

If these 15 to 20 units were
made available they could be
rented for about $105 per month.

Johnson's. report contradicts
a number of previous general
assumptions concerning married
student housing. such as his find
ing that the present housing

available “is of lower quality
than the students desire, even
though the students are willing
to pay higher rents to aquire
better quality housing,” and that
distance is not a crucial factor

The college does not officially
assist students in locating hous-
es, although Bourdeaux and
Nicholls both have lists of rent-
al units and the Dean of Stu-
dents office often has contacts.
But this is all informal and
housing is still very difficult to
find.

Davidson's decision to go co-
educational, if approved by the
trustees in May, could substan-
tially relieve the problem. Pre-
liminary studies for the new
dormitories needed to house the
additional students is already
being done by the Student Life
Committee (SLC) and by Vice
President of Finance and De-
velopment C. David Cornell.

He envisions a number of small
housing units in a cluster pat-
tern containing suites which
could be used by married stu-
dents as well as single students.

The problem with this seem-
ingly ideal solution is that it is
at least two years in the future.
The college is hesitant to build
an apartment complex because
the financial considerations are
not feasible.

The best solution is for the
college to encourage private in-
vestors to build an apartment
complex in Davidson. Some
steps in this direction have been
taken, but they are limited. The
possibility that these units would
be subsidized in any fashion by

AN IRRATIONAL TRIP

the college is not very great,
according to Cornell.

Both Terry and Nicholls would
like to see the private sector
build in the area, and both
agree that any apartment com-
plex for married students should
be for married students only.
This presents a problem to the
private investor concerned with
a return on his investment who
might want to rent to tenants
other than students.

BLEEP ... TOOT.

But Cornell sees no college
action on the problem in the
next two years as far as build-
ing is concerned.

The problem of married stu-
dent housing still exists despite
studies and suggestions. The
first step to a solution to the
problem is a commitment of
some kind, some kind of policy
statement, of the college’s re-
sponsibility to married student
housing.

‘American Life’ Presented

A REVIEW
By TERRY HIRST
Staff Writer

A. R. Gurney Jr.. author of
“Scenes From American Life,”
calls his play “A Play in Two
Acts”; Rupert Barber calls his
production of it “A Revue.”
Herein lies the difference.

By calling his production “A
Revue,” Barber presumably is
more concerned with presenting
us with a collage of memora-
bilia, satire, and nostalia, rath-
er than a unified dramatic ex-
perience.

His addit.on of a  song-and-
dance number at the beginning,
a strobe light, a raid on the
theater, and the Bunny Hop at
the cocktail party are examples
of a vaudevilian flavor that he
has tried to add. I am not sure
that it works.

By reducing the play to a re-
vue, he nullifies a lot of the pro-
fundity which the playwright
inay have originally intended.
The theme, if there is one, is a
criticism of social eliteness and
an admission that we rarely
profit from our mistakes or the
mistakes of our parents.

The play is basically good.
The production should be better.
Barber has made some subtle
improvements on the script. The
pantomime of the computer in
the election scene is an ingeni-
ous bit of stage business. He has
also done the playwright several
injustices.

Breaking up the futuristic au-
tomobile scene, originally in-
tended for one car and one cou-
ple, imto five cars with five
couples is a precarious addition
to an already disunified produc-
tion.

The keys to a production of
this nature are improvisation
and timing. Both were off Wed-
nesday night. The whole pro-
duction needs to be tighter. The
scenes should hit us hard and
fast and continue to drive their
message to the end.

The actors should be there
and ready when the lights come
up and attack each scene, each
line, like it’s their own tour de
force.

The Hodson stage, in its im-
mensity, makes this rapid move-
ment difficult, but if lighting
cues were more precise, if lines
were not frequently inaudible,
if the set were moved foward
and used along with the side
doors to mask actors, props,
and costumes, the whole play
would move a lot faster.

I did not get a sense of en-
thusiasm from all of the actors.
There were very few attempts
to radically change _personali-
ties between the scenes. There
should be a*more creative at-
tempt at improvisation; a more
concerned effort to establish a
distinctive character for each
scene.

A notable exception to this is
Steve Suflas, who was able con-

sistently to project his person-
ality across the curtain line. 1
applaud his enthusiasm.

George Draughon, a master
of mime, was not at his best.
Ray Mendenhall makes the best
of the opening number, and
Ken Jones, in the Encounter
Group skit, takes a complex
character and lets us sympa-
thize with him.

The second half, thanks to the
playwright, gives the cast con-
siderably more of a dramatic
challenge. For a few scenes,
Gurney gives up his everlasting
criticism of the older generation
and offers some poignant char-
acter insights.

In the restaurant scene and in
the canoe-burning scene, Jennet
Robinson finally proves her dra
matic sensibilities in a beautiful
bit of timing and grace.

Chris Holly, Martha Taylor,
Granger Roller, Bobbie Black-
wood, Bob Bolick and Gus Suc-
cop all could have been better
if they had been given better
parts and, in fact, a better play
with a little more substance.

Even Cecil Burney’s Virgil
Foxisms at the Steinway had
an air of improvisation about
it.

Charlie Hodge’s set is a clev-
er combination of a design rem-
iniscent of constructivist sculp-
tre of the 1920’s, painted in
brilliantly modern colors. It pro-
vides an energetic backdrop to
the basic black costumes.
