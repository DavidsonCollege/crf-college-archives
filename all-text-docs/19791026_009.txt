Wildcats wallop Hampden-Sydney

By DAVID DONALDSON

Davidson blasted Hampden-
Sydney 42-0 last Saturday to
run their season record to five
wins and two losses. A balanced
offensive attack and a hard-
nosed defense paced the win
against the overmatched Ti-
gers.

Guilford awaits Davidson
this week in a very important
contest. A win would insure the
Cats of their first winning

season since 1969, when David- |

son was the Southern Confer-
ence champion and played in
the Tangerine Bowl. An added
incentive is Guilford’s 42-35
upset victory over Davidson
last year in Charlotte.

“They feel that they're pro-
gram is very comparable to
ours,”’ says Coach Ed Farrell,‘‘I
tend to disagree.”

If the wildcats win Saturday,
they will join an elite group of
Davidson football teams—only
one third of the teams have had
winning record Only two teams
haye won seven games, and no
team has ever won eight. One of
the team’s preseason goals was
to be the best team Davidson
has ever had. Kickoff time¢for
hopeful win number six at
Greensboro is 7:30 pm, Satur-
day.

Last Saturday, Davidson
scored on the third play of the
game, then exploded for 28
second-quarter points. Reserves

second half as the Cats added a

Soccer loses:
fourth in row

By TED JONES

The Davidson soccer team
took another game on the nose.
Friday the Wildcats took on
winless VMI and came up on
the short end of the 2-1 score.

Davidson opened with a
strong first half, and scored the
only goal in the first 45 min-
utes. Mark Elmore scored, the
goal, a penalty shot that caught
the Keydet’s All-Southern Con-
ference goalie diving the wrong
way.

Unfortunately, as the team
has exhibited in past games, the
Wildcats were unable to gener-
ate any kind of consistent play.
The gaps between the front line,
midfielders, and defense factor
grew wider and wider and
Davidson's usually good pas-
sing game never materialized.

VMI scored two embarras-
sing second half goals. The first
came on a direct kick just
outside the penalty area. Se-
veral players made fake runs
over the bali; pulling goalie
Mike Iorodanou off the line.
The shot ‘was chipped over the
four man wall and Iorodanou for
the score.

The second goal was a soccer
rarity. On a VMI corner kick,
Iorodanou lost the cross in the
sun. The ball sailed untouched
into the goal for the game’s final
tally. ;

Davidson dominated the
game for the most part, but was
unable to get the ball*into the
goal. Bill Wahl narrowly missed
a header in the closing minutes,
one of many golden opportuni-
ties that the Wildcats were not
quite able to take advantage of.

The soccer team finds itself in
a slump, having lost four games
in a row. Several players men-
tioned that the team may have
taken VMI for granted. The
Keydets were a 6-0 victim to
Davidson earlier this season..
Another player cited a possible
facotr being a lack of team
leadership, likely stemming to
the recent resignations of three
senior players.

Davidson attempted to get
back on track last night (Wed-
nesday) with a game against
nationally-ranked Appalachian
State on the Mountaineer's
astroturf field. Other games
this week are a home match
against Emory Saturday at 2
and an away game Tuesday
night against The Citadel.
