Some Hopes

—That John Currie will be in
shape to win all the sprints at
the State Meet Saturday.

—That a large number of stu-
dents will make an exodus to
the Gate City to back up that
team,

—That the sound reproduction at
the Davidson Theatre will im-
prove with age.

—That the R. O. T. C. Depart-
ment received Distinguished

Rating at the inspection last
Friday.

—That every: Senior is exempted
from every examination.

—That the above is not hoping
too much.

—That Soph Day will soon be
held, and the apprehensions of
the Freshmen relieved.

—That Mother’s Day be held in
mind and heart.

EXEMPTION

All Seniors are making feverish
attempts to boost their grades as
the closing days of the school
year approach, and to make the
fact of their exemption from
written examinations a certainty.
They tell us that this is probably
the last time exemption will ever
be in vogue at Davidson. Not. a
very pleasant outlook- for the
Juniors and Sophomores who for
two or three years have looked
forward to the time when they
too could have the privilege and
the aid of exemption.

It has always seemed to us that
exemptions were entirely fitting
for the fourth year men, Coming
as a sort of reward for steady and
earnest labor, the omission of fi-
nal exams allows the Senior to
devote his. time to things which
after college is over will mean
more to him than many examina-
tions. Moments of close brother-
hood with his college mates ‘—
work on activities which have put
the spice into his whole career as
a student. These are things which
every man holds dear. Besides,
‘the Senior is the busiest person
in the entire congregation which
makes up the college life. Ten
days of freedom from books gives
him just about time to get every-
thing settled up for the last time.
He stands three years of regular
examination—if he can average
as much as ninety per cent on his
work, what is the objection to his

release from those last and, in his
case, most binding, duties with
pad and pencil. Certainly his
scholarship is protected, It. is
anything but easy to keep eligible
for exemption.

Things look dark for further

exemptions at Davidson. The
sentiment in the student body is
very naturally strongly in favor
of them. It is hoped that some-
thing can be done to bring back
the old conditions in this respect.
We do not advocate the practice
of sticking too closely to tradi-
tion, but exemption is one tradi-
tion which is certainly fashioned
to help the student, and we hate
to see it go.

DON’T MAKE FACES

The existence of The Chame-
leon has been justified. At least,
its further existence has been
guaranteed by the student body
action recently taken. Although
the question is settled, there is
still something which may be said
about it.

As its name bears out, The

Chameleon is a magazine which
changes. This idea is embodied
in the changes made regularly on
the cover of. the magazine. This
fact, however, is secondary and
external. Its most — essential
chameleonic quality is that its
contents change and in changing
reflect the literary talent on the
campus. Any fault—if there is
fault—is not with the magazine
itself, for as a reflector it is good.
The fault lies in the literary tal-
ent of the college.
There are always men in col-
lege who need an outlet for their
latent literary ability. A means
of expression .should be given
such men, and, judging from re-
ports of other institutions, our own
Chameleon has succeeded rather
well in upholding the good name
of Davidson as a creator of good
things. Modern college life has
come to be in effect a hard-boiled
edition of life in general, and as
such it should include as many of
life’s elements is possible.
There is no doubt that literary
work is a part of life, and since
The Chameleon is an outlet ‘for
literary work on the campus, it
should therefore be included in
our edition of modern life here on
the campus.

as

A new edition of The Chame-
leon is now in your hands, and it
has been settled that it will con-_
tinue to be a part of the activities
of the school. Tt all gets down to’
this—The Chameleon is a reflec-
tor of Davidson College, so why
make the reflection poor by mak-
ing faces at it? Let us view the
matter in a constructive light,
reading the magazine, writing for
it if we-can, and above all, re-
membering that. it is doing its
level best for Davidson.

A WORTHY IDEA

With Mother’s Day in the off-
ing, some of the fraternities got
together*and petitioned the col-
lege that the fraternity houses be
allowed open on that day for en-
tertainment of the mothers. The
petition was granted, and so until
seventy-thirty o’clock on Sunday,
May 12, the boys of the various
chapters may bring their best pals
into the sanctuary. Several fra-
ternities are planning programs
for the day, and expect to give the
visiting mothers a sincere bit of
college life, and at the same time
to pay some of the old, old debt
of love.

It is a mighty commendable
thing that these boys are doing
in having a regular Mother’s Day,
and -we would like to see every
group on the campus make it a
yearly event. The “Y” could very
well take care of the non-frater-
nity men and their mothers. We
believe that a great and good
spirit would arise from such a
practice. Perhaps it could even
be made into a sort of college af-
fair, that is, the day an event for
every man on the campus, and let
the college aid in preparing a pro-
gram of entertainment.

_At any rate, it’s not too late
yet for those fraternities which

Cosmic Chaos

By J. W. McCutchan

That: old proverb about “it hardly
behooving the rest of us to speak about
any of us,” or something like that, is
probably true. Notwithstanding the
writer can not refrain from wondering
at the imagination of certain cartoon-
ists. Jiggs is often in the hospital one day
and out the next with regularity. He
must hold the record for one day cases.
Sidney Smith switches from the Gumps
to the Golds with no compunctions
whatever. Little Elmer has a black
eye in the first scene of the Sunday
sheet and is O. K. without medical aid
on the next. Still, here’s to the tickle
wood-pulp.

are not planning Mother’s Day to
get busy and arrange for one. The
boys will count it one of the
bright experiences of their col-
lege days.

“RED” LAIRD

Tt will be good to have “Red”
Laird back on the Davidson cam-
pus, and doubly®so, since he will
come in the capacity of coach and
athletic promoter for various
branches of athletic activity.
“Red” should be a valuable addi-
tion to the coaching staff, for in
his college days, not so long ago,
he was perhaps the most versatile
athlete Davidson had turned out
in many years. Winning the Nor-
tis Trophy Cup in his sophomore
year was an accomplishment for
older and more experienced heads
than Laird’s, but he turned’ the
trick,

“Red” stayed just as close to
Davidson as he could for a year
or so after leaving. During that
time he was head coach of the
Catawba College teams. He met
remarkable success there, consid-
ering that the Catawba athletic
star was just beginning to rise,
andthe institution was in the
days of its infancy, Since leaving
Catawba a year ago, Laird has
been at University School for
Boys in Atlanta, so he comes to
Davidson with a continuous rec-
ord of coaching behind him.

Congratulations to the athletic
association for obtaining the
services of “Red” Laird. He is a
splendid man to mould Wildkit-
tens into Wildcat material.

THE SMALL COLLEGE

According to a recent state-
ment in the Yale newspaper, the
death knell of the small college
has sounded, what with junior
colleges pressing them from the
rear and universities and profes-
sional schools bearing down on
them from the top. There is, or
soon will be, said this article, no
place for the in-between college.
Superficially this may appear
true, but there are other factors
to consider. A thousand indict-
ments like the one above would
not erase the undeniable fact that
thousands of parents still believe
in sending their children to col-
leges like Allegheny. Every year
our registrar is forced to turn
away almost as many-as he ad-
mits, because of a desire to keep
the enrollment down to a com-

fortable «but not overwhelming
figure. Witness also our physical

expansion in the shape of our two
new buildings. They were erect-
ed, not to enlarge the school, but
to better equip the student body
that we already have. Another
factor that the self-appointed
funeral director of the small col-
lege forgot to consider was the
matter of individuality. A school
of the size of Yale can never hope
to direct and control or even con-
sider the individual student as the
small school can. To show what
Harvard thinks ‘of the small col-
lege they are planning to spend
over eight million dollars to di-
vide the university into smaller
colleges, similar to the Oxford
type of “organization. The day
of the small college has not even

reached high noon.—Allegheny.

The British Government's budget for
the coming year is estimated at $4,-
133,000,000 with expenditures at 21
million less. The tax on tea, which
has been in effect since the reign of
Queen Elizabeth, is abolished.

Airplanes have been disturbing the
making of sound pictures in Califor-
nia, so the studios are now using red
captive balloons to warn droning
planes to keep at least 2,500 feet away.

Another new use has been found for
radio. The Fox Company, taking a
singing picture in the Fiji Islands, is
preparing to send their work to Holly-
wood by radio, William Fox having ob-
tained a special license for the purpose.

“Whoopee” is no new thing as a cry
of urging or exultation. An the Marco
play, “Mankind,” written about1450,
the following appeared:

“Hey doog! hay whope!

Whoo! Go youur wey lyghtly!”

Shakespeare used the word spelled
‘hoope’ in several. of his works. Inthe
Massinger and Dekker play, “The
Virgin Martyr” in 1603, appears,

“Whisper, nay, Lady, for my part

“T’ll cry Whoope!”

There is a form in Sanskirt, upe or
upi, which has a somewhat
meaning.

Fog seems to really be rather dan-
gerous for aviators. Last week a pilot
in Washington got lost on his own
field. He landed just.as a heavy fog
was settling, and then couldn’t find his
way to the hangars until mechanics,
attracted by the sound of his motor,
rescued him.

The trend of present air courses is
shown by the Curtiss fees. The charge
for a 25-hour flying course, enabling
you to get a private license, is $600.
A course to qualify you for a limited
commercial license (50 hours) costs
$1,200, and a course for a transport
license costs $4,500. All of which en-
courages most people to buy another
Ford and keep on as before,

Speaking of politeness, the peak
seems to have been reached when the
British and French were fighting in
the battle of Fontenoy in 1748. The
British commander shouted, “Gentle-
men of the French Guard, fire!” The
French Comte saluted and replied,
“Fire yourselves, gentlemen; we never
fire first!”

Fate continues to be ironical. Major
General Neville, who has gone through
four wars uninjured, fell in a bathtub
in Washington and broke a rib.

Perhaps it is a foolish notion that
rebels, maybe it isn’t. The tale runs
like this: Centuries ago in a small and
oppressed province of Bavaria, the
“plague” was taking its deadly toll.
The people of the little town of Obe-
rammergau were religious, they ap-
poached the saintly. They saw that in
another week there would not be a liv-
ing person left. They gathered their
priests and solemnly Promised in the
form of a vow, that they would enact,
in periods of ten years, the story of
the Christus, if this ‘peril might be
taken from them. The next morning
the plague miraculously stopped.

These people were true to their word.
not one period was missed: until the
World War petrified every convention-
al custom in the world. Then the play

pany plays in the hippodrome in New

from deploring, however that the
greatest pageant on earth is being com-
mercialized? Should one who has had
contact with “The Strange Interlude,”
and the like be given the supreme dic-
tum? It should be remembered,
though, that the Pageant is an ex-
pensive one to portray. The costumes
are of the most expensive material in
the world, the stage settings are cost-
ly. Perhaps, with that country’s
sunken values of coinage, they are do-
ing this in order that they may con-
tinue the play in the future and still
keep the vows of their ancestors,

Typical court trials in this country
are typified by the Vanderburg case in
Gastonia. We do not attempt to say
whether the youth is guilty or not.
But look at the aspects of the case. It
took over a day’s time to select the
eleven juriors. Notice the clever law-
yers, how they play upon the ,techni-
cal side of the affair. Of Course it is
all justified by law, but still, how dif-

ferent is it from.a mock, trial?

Well, the annual inspection of our R. O. T. C. heroes has once again with-

drawn into the realm of old, forgotten, far-off things.

It leaves behind, how-

ever, a train of memories in the form of bruises where the'mean old inspector
smacked the rifles out of the trembling hands of some of the less fortunate.

A few of the soldier boys are quite proud of themselves.

Fresh Aigs and

Fresh Ole Thing, two of the young hopefuls of the battalion, swell with pride
whenever the inspection is mentioned in their presence. Aigs, who is a lad of
considerable prowess, didn’t let the inspgetor get away with anything. Why,
when he tried to grab young Aig’s gun, the fighting blood of countless gen-
erations of hard boiled Aigs rose in the latter’s veins, and he resisted man-
fully. Naturally he made a more lasting impression on the inspector than did
the other spineless creatures who gave up their trusty Springfields without a

single.sign of fight. ¢

Fresh Thing, on the other hand, gave the inspector some very enlighten-
ing information. While Ole was submitting to a close crutiny of -his person
and fire-arm, the following dialogue took place:

Inspector: What have you there?
Ole Thing: A gun, sir.

Inspector: Naturally, but what do you call it?

Ole Thing: Well, after a drill on a hot day, I sayy it a &%@lbX"$tb)’ !.

Anyway, the spectators semeed to appreciate the inspection which pro-
gressed to the accompaniment of cries of “Louder and funnier” from the side-

lines.

FRESHMAN CAPS

It is our opinion that the student
body would most strongly oppose any
action submitted to it for abolition of
the red headgear worn by the first-
year men until about Easter of their
freshman year.
vit has been several years since the
inauguration of the cap custom; suffi-
ciently long for the idea to become in-
grained in the social order of the in-
stitution. Were it to be abolished
now, all of a sudden, there would be
nothing to balance its loss; the result
would be an upset in the student body

that would perhaps take on the ap- |

pearance of a revolution.

The university freshmen wear no
distinctive dome-coverings and learn
little of subordination. By the time
they are among the upper classes they
have adopted the traditional U. N. C.
superiority and high-hat complex.

With the abolition of caps will go
laxity in the rule of speaking 'to every-
one on the campus; then matches will
be thrown away and errands go un-
done. What small amount of school
spirit we now have will be cast to the
winds.

Shall we see North Carolina State
drop down like this? Rather let us
build it up more towards the sky. Per-
mit the freshmen of next year to pro-
tect themselves from woodpeckers, but
allow™no exceptions, as in the past.

LAST GASPS OF “ROUGH”

As the final stages of the second
week-end of Rough week come around,
it is evident that the recent edict of
the Interfraternity council to curb the
horse play has been more of a suc-
cess than a failure. For the most Part
the provisions of the new ruling have
been followed out, and the good re-
sults in prospect have materialized.

The passage of this ruling is not to
be considered an innovation peculiar

to Indiana university alone. The fra-
ternities here seem to have fitted them-
selves to an evolution which is going

through various stages at all the
schools in the country, In some insti-
tutions the freshman ordeal was

abolished outright and every vestige
of it swept away. At other schools
only minor curtailments have been
brought into effect.

It is to be expected that Rough week
will be a thing of the past in most of
the schools of the country in a few
years. ° The limitation of the event to
a week-end cannot be expected ‘to re-
main here. The changing customs
eventually will bring about still more
elimination and prohibition until the
tradition dies out entirely.

The gradual elimination of Rough
week appears to be the proper method
here because of the strength of senti-
ment. To cut it off suddenly would
result in too much opposition to insure
its success. The experiences of the
upperclassmen in each organization
act as a brake on movements of this
kind, and the elimination of the ordeal
must be set at their rate of graduation.

The shortening and elimination of
Rough week is not a single change
going on in fraternity life. Rather it
is a part of a general humanitarian
movement now under way. Most of
the schools have abolished freshman
hazing on the campus. Not only Rough
week but fraternity paddling is dying
out, in the Eastern schools especially.
In a few years the center of the move-
ment will be in Indiana university.

Those who look on the trend as a
sort of effeminate thing to be combat-
ted at every turn will find that is some-
thing more than that alone. It is a
drive with the sentiment of the lead-
ers of the University world behind it.
There is. little belief among those who
realize the full significance of the
movement that it ever will be stopped.
It appears, therefore, useless for the
rabid fraternity men of the old school

to attempt to bar it—Indiana Daily
