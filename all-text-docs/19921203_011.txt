DAVIDSON WILDCATS

Semifinal GameTwo
Davidson Wildcats vs. San Diego Toreros

Coach Slagle:

"It's great to be playing in the Final Four, whether it's at home
or not. Being at home, obviously, it makes it a little more
special; it also makes a lot of extra work for us — great work --
no complaints. San Diego's an excellent team. If you look at
where they've come from, it's very similar, it's sort of a mirror
of Davidson. Both teams were under .500 last year, but
played great schedules. This year things have clicked. Both
teams have played good schedules, have played great teams,
and have done well.”
