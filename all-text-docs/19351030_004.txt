Well, the old Citadel jinx came all the

haunt the ‘Cats for another year and now
that we can see things from a different

Coach Tatum Gressette handed us about
the game being a cinch for Davidson
had its desired effect.

Homecoming by avenging last

that a team representing
630 students can make the best look sick
when it comes to mixing things up on the

Paul Pittman and ‘‘Teeny’’ Laff-

and down the spines of Wildcat
supporters with
their thrilling
p e rformances,
but this week
Felix wants to
place credit up-
on those men
who aren’t par-
. ticularly spec-
acular, but
: who neverthe-
less, contribute
just as much to
the gante.
Hunter Mc-
Clung, Baxter Yarborough, Wood
Burns, and Midget Verble are the
ones we have in mind this week.
These men have won their spurs
in football by their consistent play
and deserve all the credit we can
give them.

Cathey always takes
care of his job of blocking admirably, we
could not help but notice one particular
time in which he blocked a Ci tadel man
two or three times on a single play. The
aggravated Cadet, after his last trip to
mother earth, arose and expressed his
opinion on certain matters.

However,
continued play broke up any

prospects

of another contest besides the one al-
ready engaged in.

alternative but
to lateral back-

body and in
spite of all the backward play and
wrangling, Maurice checked out
for 35 yards to place the ball on
the frosh 10 yd. line.

Considering the fact that the “pro's”
had only a few plays which they were
acquainted with, they did very well and
should have won the game. They hit hard
at tackling and made consistent gains:
Coach Newton remarked while watching
the game that a lakge number of re-

GRANT IN GOOD FORM
Johnson Wins Tournament With

Loss Of Only One Set
Grant “Swede” Johnson overcame

Locke White in three sets, 6-1, 6-3, 6-4,
last Friday to win the finals match of the
freshman fall tennis tournament. Smash-
ing through five opponents, Johnson
gained the top with the loss of only one
set out of thirteen played.

Ken Lawson was defeated in the semi-
Johnson, 6-4, 6-4, 10-8. White
entered the last bracket after winning
from Perry Sloan in a hotly contested
match, 6-1, 8-10, 6-2, 1-6, 7-5. All except
Johnson have played on high school or
prep tennis teams, but he im-
proved. his steady game in every match
to show excellent form in the finals. Ed
Cloyd lost to Johnson, 2-6, 6-1, 9-7, in
the first round. Bill Preyer followed with
a 0-0, 6-3 score. In the third round Ray-
mond Pittman was the loser by 6-2, 7-5.
Johnson took an early lead over White
with five straight games, and then closed
the set 6-1. White was not playing as
well in this finals series as in his meeting
with Sloan, but he brought most of the
games to deuce points. During the second
set Johnson sent many an ace into 'the
oposite court and turned in several lucky
tallies. The score was even at 2-2 when
Johnson won two games, then lost his
service to bring the total*to 4-3. With
two more games won by his consistent
serving he took the decision, 6-3. White
had Johnson 3-1 in the next set before
he rallied to force four consecutive games
from the West Virginian and bring. the
score to match game. Johnson had the
advantage of volleying, making a num-
ber of kills and good placements. White
won the next game on his own serve, but
Johnson retaliated with three service aces
and a swift placement shot to the back
court in the game that brought the set
to a 6-4 end.

White, Lawson, and Sloan, who rate
very close to each other, will probably
form the nucleus of the freshman team
in the spring, for Johnson does not ex-
pect to play tennis. Track and baseball

Johnny Mackorell, fornier holdup of
the Wildcat backfield, has made his
showing this season with the New York
Giants. He made a very good showing
early in the season but due to being the
lightest man on the squad, his progress
has been handicapped. He has put on
approximately twelve pounds, however,
since the opening of the football season
and expected more
service for the Giants later on. He has
appeared in several games during the
season although now rated on the sub-

anymore this season.

Freddie Crawford, former outstanding
tackle for the Duke Blue Devils, has
been playing first string ball for the

and has been doing very well in other
of their scheduled games.

Eddie Kahn, another of the North

playing his season out with the Boston

QUCCER ENTERS
PORT PROGRAM

Kenneth Scott and Bill Bell Will
Lead First Davidson
Soccer Team

This year for the first time in the his-
tory of the college, Davidson is sponsor-
ing an intercollegiate soccer team.
Jacked by the enthusiastic support of
“Pete” Whittle, the candidates have been
practicing every day on the Freshman
football field. The team has made rapid
progress under the direction of Kenneth
Scott, who is both: co-captain and coach,
supported by co-captain and manager Bill
Bell.

‘The first game has been scheduled with
High Point College for November 15.
In spite of an extensive program last
year, High Point was undefeated, and
will provide a real test for the Wildcats.
A list of the most promising: players,
from whom the team will probably be
chosen, follows: Oscar Armstrong, Bill
Bell, Alfred Bixler, Charlie Bixler, Jim
Cothran, Arthur Haake, Russell Kerr,
Howard McFayden, Johnny McMullen,
Ken Scott, Graham Squires, Gene Vog-
ler, Bobby Wilson, Johnny Wilson and
Leonard Woodward.

Other soccer teams with whom the
Davidson team will try to arrange games
are sponsored by Duke, Furman, Clem-
son, Catawba, Fort Bragg, Kernersville,
and the City of Winston-Salem.

Much Interest Shown
In Fall Track Classic

According to Heath Whittle, director of
intramural athletics, the annual decath-
lon contest will be run off in the near
future. Much interest has been shown in
this event in the past, and a large group
is expected to enter the competition this
year.

The decathlon is composed of fourteen
track and field events, with points ranging
up to 100 being awarded in each event
for such time records as ten seconds for
the hundred yard dash. Keen competition
is expected in all of the fourteen divis-
ions of the meet.

In the race for the Big Five cham-
pionship, we find a three way deadlock
at the mid-season between North Caro-
lina, Duke, and North Carolina State.
In the league, Carolina has victories over
Davidson and Wake Forest; Duke has a
victory over Wake Forest; and N. C.
State has victories over ‘Wake Forest
and Davidson.

NORTH CAROLINA UNIVERSITY

The Tar Heels have played only two
games in the “Big Five’ and have
amassed in those two games 28 points
to their opponents’ none. It seems that
the Heels smell the “scent of roses in
the air.” Next Saturday, the powerful

Tar Heels fisk their clean record of no
defeats and no ties when they play Hunk
Anderson's big, bad Wolves at Raleigh
for the lead of the Big Five. To Caro-
lina, however, it means far more than
the lead of the league, it means another
game that they must win if they want
to stay headed Southwest toward Pasa-

The Blue Devils got off to a good start
in the Big Five by beating Wake For-
est 14-0 in the first game of the season
for either team. Devils have not played a
Big Five game since that time and will
not play another yntil they meet the
Wildcats here at Richardson Field on
November 9th. The Dukes also had their

Support Is Pledged By
Managers For Season

“The thing we are trying to do,” said
J. B. Goslen, varsity football manager,
‘is to fix the team up so they'll win the
“wel? in-
cludes himself, D. B. Griffin, equipment
manager, R. L. Harris, who is manager
of the Freshman team, and all of the
assistant managers.

These men were elected to the above
positions by the entire football squad at
the end of the 1934 season, during which
time they had served in the capacity of
Junior managers. ‘The Junior managers
for the current season are L. K. Hill, D
R. Sellars, and J. O.-Branten;—-who-in
turn will be elected to the Senior man-
agerial positions. They were chosen from
a group of five, the other two of which
were G. S. Norfleet and R. M. Vance, on
the basis of the amount and quality of
the work done during their Freshman
and Sophomore years. The following
hold the position of Sophomore mana-
gers: T. F. Morrison, J. K. Dorsett, and
A. D. McLaughlin.

The Freshman managers are Cage
Brewer, R. A. Burgess, R. S. Spencer,
D, A. McQueen, P. S. Marchant, A. H.
Moore, E. J. Webb, R. J. Towell, K. C.
Campbell, and P. M. Davidson. Goslen
has announced that a few Freshman
managerial positions are still vacant and
that it is not too late to try out for them

if any first-year men wish to do so.

Frosh Hold All-Americans
Four Yard Line

Coach Unger’s Pro’s, alias the All-
Americans, played the freshman team to
a scoreless tie on Richardson Field last
Friday, October 25.

The game came as a result of a verbal
and written challenge tendered the
“Pro’s” by the freshmen team. The writ-
ten challenge was read in chapel Friday
morning. The epistle demanded an
swer within fifteen seconds after
reading. Result: the football match.

The captain of the All-Americans was
C. C. Quick; and of the freshthen, Bob-
by Abell. Hugh Gracy acted in the ca-
pacity of referee; Jim Dickson, field
judge; Johnny Pierce, head linesman;
and “Tricky, Dave” Sellars, time kepeer,

With the opening whistle the freshmen
kicked off to the Pro’s, who returned the
ball about ten yards when the frosh pro-
ceeded to hold the Pro’s for two downs
and forced them to kick. With the ball
in their possession the freshmen started
down the field with a forty yard march
by ‘’Boose” Brown. This proved to be
one of the most spectacular plays of the
game, exhibiting a neat bit of broken
field running on the part of Brown and
some good blocking on the part of his
team mates. Following this run, Hunt
made nine yards on a play off right tackle
and on the next play a freshman back
made a first down. On their own twenty-
four yard line the Pro’s dug in and held
the freshmen for four downs and the
ball passed over to the All-Americans.
As the querter ended, Charlie Brown
kicked out of danger to their opponents’
thirty yard line.

In the second period, after two un-
successful runs, Stair kicked to Peabody.
on his own twenty-six, the latter return-
ing the ball for nine yards, On this play
Hunt was hurt and was replaced by
“Little Tip’ Harrison in the freshmen
line-up. The “Pro’s” made thirty yards
on the next two plays by means of a pass
from Quick to Peabody and a run by
Peabody off left tackle. Continuing this
drive with short gains, the Pro’s reached
the freshmen four yard line where they
were held for downs and the ball changed
hands. Stair kicked the ball from behind
his own goal line to the freshman thirty-
five. The Pro’s came back with a ten
yard gain by use of their famous spread
formation and the half ended with the
ball on the twenty-five.

The two teams returned to the second
half strengthened by substitutions. The
freshmen received the kick off and re-
turned it to their own thirty. Stair took
the ball on the next play off right tackle
for fifteen yards. Passes to Iverson and
Brown laid the ball on the All-American
thirty-five yard line and another pass
brought.the freshmen to the fifteen. Tak-
ing to the air once more the frosh tried
two more passes which were knocked
down. A third pass was intercepted by
Bill Nicholson to put an end to the
touchdown drive. The Pro’s came. back
with two first downs and the third quar-
ter ended. :

Play having been resumed, the “Pro's”
kicked from their own thirty-five to
“Little Tip”. Harrison who. returned the
ball to the forty-seven yard marker, The
All-Americans held the freshmen, who
finally kicked -to the twenty-five. Here

VP. FRIDAY

Kitten-Gobbler Tilt Brought Here
To Satisfy College Eligi-
bility Ruling

The football game between the Da-
vidson freshmen and the V. P. I. year-
lings, originally scheduled to be played
at Blacksburg last week-end, will be held
on Richardson Field, Friday, November
1, at 2:30 p. m. The change of the place
of the contest was occasioned by the in-
eligibility of nine members of the Da-
vidson freshman team.

According to athletic rules here, no
student shall represent the college on
any athletic team away from the college
unless he is reported as passing in at
feast three three-hour courses. The nine
freshmen in question are therefore eligi-
ble to play in home games, although they
cannot take athletic trips. Due to the
change of the scene of the game, the
next two games between Davidson and
V. P. I. frosh, those coming in 1936-37,
will be played at Blacksburg.

In the first game of the Davidson sea-
son last year, the Gobbler frosh beat the
Kittens by a score of 12-2. This year,
however, thelocal freshmen will try to
regain some of their prestige, lost at the
hands of the State frosh, at the expense
of the first year men from Blacksburg.

-These nine men compose almost the
“cream of the crop” insofar as football
ability is concerned. However, with the
game scheduled here on Richardson field
these men will be prepared for the “little
Gobblers,” who, according to reports are
a little weak this year.

The American Council of Learned So-
cieties will hold a six weeks’ course in
Arabic and Islamic studies at Princeton

University next summer.
