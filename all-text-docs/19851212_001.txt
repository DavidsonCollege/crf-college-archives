Matlock discusses
Soviet relations

By DAVE WILLIAMS

Ambassador Jack Matlock Jr.,
senior director of European and
Soviet Affairs for the National Se-
curity Council, spoke to Davidson
students and faculty last night
concerning the recent history of
U.S.-Soviet relations and _ pros-
pects for future relations in light of
the recent Geneva summit. Mat-
. lock is President Reagan’s chief
advisor on Soviet affairs and
played a major role in preparing
the Reagan administration for the
summit as well as carrying out the
agenda.

Matlock cited two reasons for
the United States’ difficulty in
maintaining a strong relationship
with the Soviet Union: “There are
extremely deep differences be-
tween our societies and interests
which in some aspects cannot be
bridged.” Also, “the Soviet Union
is a country which . . . tends to
define their security in ways so
universal, it means insecurity for
anyone else.”

In recent years a wide vacilla-
tion has occurred in U.S. policy to
the Soviet Union, which “has
greatly weakened our effective-

ness in dealing with the Soviets,”
Matlock said. “In the 1970s, we
needed nothing so much as a
steady policy which would stand
the vicissitudes of Soviet action,
so that we would not be thrown
from the heights of euphoria to
despair.”

Matlock pointed out several
crucial problems encountered in
dealing with the Soviet Union:
“The irresponsible use of the
Soviet military to achieve national
ends outside the borders has made
arms control quite difficult.”” He
emphasized that nuclear arms
levels are much too high and that
they need to be decreased, al-
though “getting them down
doesn’t achieve that much.”

Matlock also cited a “total
lack of trust and confidence in the
relationship” as well as “‘a very lit-
tle amount of interaction” be-
tween the two superpowers as hin-
drances to progress. These con-
cerns have contributed to the final
problem of achieving adequate
compliance with agreements
made between the two superpow-
ers. Matlock said, “There have
been times when agreements are

virtually ignored [by the Soviet
Union], particularly in their lack
of regard for human rights.”

In planning the agenda for the
recent Geneva summit, Matlock
emphasized that the Reagan ad-
ministration attempted to correct
mistakes made at past summits. In
the early 1970s, he said, Nixon
and Brezhnev negotiated and
signed nine or 10 agreements.
Nixon and Brezhnev loved the
publicity, but the agreements
were not adhered to in later years.
“The facts are that agreements
aren't negotiable at summits and
shouldn’t be,”’ Matlock said.

Matlock said the real impor-
tance of holding summit meetings
lies in “having the leaders of the
only countries in the world that
can destroy each other establish a
relationship, so that in the future
they can communicate rapidly and
with understanding.”

Concerning the Geneva sum-
mit, Matlock said officials went
into the meeting with a realistic
view of what is possible. “I be-
lieve we achieved what we had

hoped for. In a real sense, what

Davidson, Queens discuss stereotyping, safety

By ANDREA DIEDRICH

Several Davidson students
met with a group of Queens Col-
lege students to — discuss
stereotypng and poor social rela-
tions between the two colleges
Nov. 12 at Queens College.
Davidson Assistant Dean of Stu-
dents Harriette Root arranged the
meeting with Queens Dean of Stu-
dents Diana Williams after hear-
ing several Davidson students and
Davidson College Chaplain Char-
lie Summers express concern
about relationships _—_ between
Davidson students and women at-
tending parties here.

Senior Melissa Jones, presi-
dent of the Davidson Women’s
Concerns Committee, attended
the meeting. She said, ‘I was im-

pressed with the [Queens] stu-
dents I met. They were bright and
articulate, and it was fun to meet
with them.”

Senior Union President Rob
Vaughn also attended the meeting
and said: “I was interested and im-
pressed that two groups of women
would get together to try and work
out differences, when they didn’t
absolutely have to be worked out.
My impression is that if it were
two groups of men, they probably
wouldn't have tried.”

Queens SGA President Heidi
Howell attended the meeting. “I
was so pleased with the meeting,”
she said. “I really appreciate the
fact that Davidson students recog-
nize the problem of stereotyping
and are willing to do something

about it.”

Jones felt two main goals were
important results of the meeting.
The first goal is to educate Queens
women who attend parties at
Davidson about the emergency
services that exist here such as the
Davidson Emergency Rescue
Squad (DERS) and the Rape
Crisis Center. This goal will be
accomplished by — distributing
cards with Davidson emergency
phone numbers on them to Queens
students. The cards will also have
phone numbers of Queens stu
dents who would be willing to
pick up fellow students left at
Davidson parties without rides
home and possibly phone num-
bers of female Davidson students
who would agree to let a stranded

Queens student spend the night in
their room.

The second goal is to prevent
stereotyping by involving Queens
students in activities other than
Patterson Court activities. Jones
said, “This goal is ambitious, but
it is something worth working
for.” As president of the WCC
Jones hopes to involve Queens
women in planning and participat-
ing in the activities sponsored by
her committee. Jones sees trans
portation as the biggest problem in
involving Queens students in
Davidson activities.

Vaughn hopes to invite the
Queens women to participate in
the Short Courses sponsored by
the Union that are held after
Christmas break. Root — said

Queens women will be invited to
participate in the sexuality semi
nar to be held in February. Howell
also plans to invite Davidson stu-
dents to activities at Queens.

Root said no definite plans
iiave been made for another meet
ing between Queens and David
son students.

The other Davidson students
who attended the meeting were
DERS member Olivier van Dier
donck, Davidson Rape
Crisis Melissa Mcle
more and Patterson Court Council
President Lisa McNeilly. David-
son Assistant Dean of Students
Paula Miller and Mary Jo Clark.
advisor of the Rape Crisis Center.
