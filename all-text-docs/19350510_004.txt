In Final Baseball Game

Davidson-Navy Football
Game Slated For 1936

Through the efforts of Captain
Norton G. Pritchett, definite
plans have been made for a foot-
ball game between Davidson and
Navy to be on October 3, 1936,
at Annapolis. ‘

Captain Pritchett opened ne-
gotiations with Navy some four
years ago. Last fall he made
some headway, but was unable
to arrive at any definite settle-
ment. Early this spring Navy
set the date and made an offer to
Davidson to play at Annapolis.
Captain Pritchett was not satisfied
with the terms, and persuaded
Navy to make a larger financial
offer. This Navy agreed to do,
and Captain Pritchett accepted
the engagement to play. No con-
tract has as yet been drawn up,
but both parties have agreed to
let the correspondance between
the two to-serve as confirmation
of the agreement.

Captain Pritchett, who suc-
ceeded in procuring games with
Army, thus befittingly ends his
career as head of the Davidson
physical education department
by establishing athletic relations
between Davidson and Navy also.

Classic State Meet

Eddie Frasier Re Receives Big
Ovation From Excited Fans
At Emerson Field

CATS GET 12} POINTS

Frazier, Gammon, Lee, Pittman
And Pierce Score

Last Saturday afternoon,-the North
Carolina Tar Heels accounted for their
fourteenth consecutive victory in the
annual sfate meet at Chapel Hill, with
Duke’a close second and the Wildcats
in third place.

A crowd of something like 1,000 ex-
cited spectators sat in~ perfect track
weather while record after record fell
at Emerson Field in the annual state
classic,

While Duke and Carolina fought for
the majority of the honors, Davidson
took advantage of this duel and during
the Carolina-Duke feud, the Wildcats
slipped in and stole 124 points. It was
clear througktout the meet that Car-
olina. and Duke had the majority of the
talent which furnished a lot of the ex-
citement for the fans.

Fazier, without a doubt received the
most favorable and most abondant
applause throughout his two mile grind,
Farle was given a tremendous hand as
he sprinted in on the last lap of his
race. Frazier ran the event in very
good time (9 minutes, 44 and .3 sec-
onds), ‘Lhe “Champ” strange to say,
ran his last mile faster tan his first
mile. He ran his first milé a bit slower
than he-had planned to and when he
Fealized that he was slightly “behind
time” (behind his own time) he had
to put on the steam, He ran the first
mile in about 4.59 and then he ran the
second half of the race in about’ 4.45,

Frazier's mile record of 4,22 (estab-
lished in 1934) was broken by William-
son, shaving only two very meager
tenths of one second from Earle’s re-
cord. The Varsity points were piled
up by; Frazier’s win in the two mile
event (5); Gammon’s tie for ‘second
inthe high jump (24); Lee and Pittman
tying for second place in the pole vault
along with two others (3) and Pierce's
178 foot throw for a third place in the
javelin, (2). The total points for
Davidson, were 124. Frazier was the
high point man with his five points
which he gained in the two mile.

Evins, of Carolina bettered Cochtan’s
(Davidson, 1934) record in the shot put
by seven and a fraction inches.

The total scoring for each team was
as follows, Carolina, 754; Duke 67;
Davidson, 124; N. C. State, (Zori), (5);
Lenoir-Rhyne, 2; W ake Forest, 2.
