Presbytery Opposes
Dancing In Any Form

(Continued from Page 3)

ance opposing and condemning dancing,

be it resolved that Mecklenburg Pres-
bytery place itself on record as being
unalterably opposed to dancing at David-
son College under any form or condi-
tion and that we request the board of
trustees to so answer the request of the
students of the college for permission to
dance.”

This substitute resolution, quickly sec-
onded, ushered in a lively discussion.

Thomas Glasgow, Myers Park church
elder expressed his opinion that “it was
the duty of the college to supply danc-
ing parlors that the students might be
duly and safely chaperoned.”

A number of other ministers spoke,
urging that the trend of church schools
become spiritual rather than face the
customs of the world.

Dr. C. W. Boyd of the Westminster
Presbyterian church stated that he fa-
vored either proper chaperonage of danc-
ing or prohibition of dancing, and that
he frowned upon dancing being prohib-
ited at the college and permitted at a
hotel in Charlotte. His amendment to
the substitute, to the effect that student
dancing in Charlotte be barred, was car-
ried.

On the following day there appeared
a fiery letter in the Charlotte News by
Dr. R. H. Black of the North Charlotte
Baptist church who violently condemned
dancing both in high schools and col-
leges. Said he: “The modern dance is
one of the slime pits of this age. Mul-
titudes of young people today are being
plunged into moral chaos through a lack
of proper warning and reasonable re-
straint . . . It is only in the hours of
some overmastering passion which has
been developed through the sensual
movements of the dance and accentu-
ated by the brutalizing influence of jazz
music, that young people plunge to their
ruin.”

He continued, “I used to dance. I
know the danger of it... It is one of the
greatest evils of this day and age. It
ought not to be allowed in our schools

. Dancing is resulting in a degenera-
tion of the intellect, and the complete
annihilation of spiritual ideals...”

In answer to this hail of fire and
brimstone came a letter from E. L.
Moore which began: “Despite the oc-
casional and belated blasts from the
wheezy throats of ‘the Mrs. Grundys
liberalization and tolerance are fast mak-
ing headway...”

He stressed the fact that present day
dancing was not to be compared with
ancient biblical orgies termed “danc-
ing,” but it is true of the old man that
“as his joints get stiff he hurls the epi-
thets of evil and sin at the dance.” He
added that the associations in the dance
are quite the same as those in a classroom
and that, “Intellectually supervised, it
means a healthy mingling of the sexes
,.in an invigorating, stimulating social ex-
ercise and pastime.

“Of course, there are the Mr. and
Mrs. Grundys so spiritually exalted and
so physically withered as to forget that
young people have growing bodies, emo-
tions and desires, and yet withal, a code
more suited to their needs than those
that would be forced upon them. . .
Students “no longer shy at the brim-
stone and damnation tactics, but have
learned to inspect the traditional dogma
with a critical eye, and after pouring
upon it the fluid of present day know-
ledge, make a decision of their own.

“Sanction school dances—or drive them
to unsupervised parties,” he concluded.

where learned addresses are made of
various phases of education, he always
came away feeling that nobody yet knows
exactly what education is. There are a
great many people who are trying to find
out.

Dr. Lingle said he sometimes thinks
there must be college students who are
more or less like Christopher Columbus
of whom it has been said that when he
started upon his voyage of discovery he
“did.not know where he was going, when
he got there he did not know where he
was, and when he got back, he did not
know where he had.been.” In the face
of such a situation it is very important
that those who teach and those who
are taught should try to define clearly
for themselves the objectives toward
which they are aiming.

Dr. Lingle suggested the following as
proper objectives for a Christian Col-
lege: 1. The Christian College should
endeavor to store up hearts and minds
of students with a rich store house of
information. The world is rich in his-
tory, literature, art, science, music, and
many other things. The college should
reach out and select from these the finest
and best and store them up in the hearts
and minds of its students, thus enabling
and enriching their lives and at the same
time helping them to find a place in the
world and to live more intelligent and
effective lives. 2. The Christian College
should stimulate the imagination of stu-
dents and help them to appreciate the
finest and best that is in the world and
life.

3. It is the function of the College

Large Number Intend
To Enroll Next Year

Seventeen more students are now reg-
istered to attend Davidson next year
than there were at this time last year,
states F. W. Hengeveld, Registrar.

There are 432 men registered for next
year against 415 at the corresponding
time last year. This number is rapidly
increasing and is expected to reach last
year’s total soon. Mr. Hengeveld ex-
pects to have the registration of the
three upper classes completed in the near
future, and the Freshman class as soon
thereafter as possible.

cated man is not simply a walking en-
cyclopedia of miscellaneous information,
but one who has learned to think his
way through. Through the store house
of information which is passed on to
him by the college, and also, to think
his way through the problems of life.

4. To awaken in its students the holy
ambition to be something and do some-
thing. A man never reaches his best
as long as he has to be controlled and
driven from without, but only after a
new fire has been lighted within.

5. To develop Christian personality
in the lives of their students. After all
what a man is counts more than what
he does. The impress of the person-
ality of ‘a great teacher continues to in-
fluence the life of a student long after
he has forgotten what the teacher taught.

6. To give the master teacher his right-
ful place in the hearts and lives of teach-
ers and students, in class rooms, and
on the campus. Any education that
leaves him out will always lack some-
thing that is vital and eternal.
