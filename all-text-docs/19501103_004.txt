“Look”, they shouted incredu-
lously, “it runs.” They motioned to
the creaky, old model “T” Ford
that jerked slowly down the hill
and drove away. This machine is
one of the many ancient carriages
that chug, groan, strain and stum-
ble around the campus carrying
theie proud and ingenious owners.
Why would anybody ever want to
become involved with one of those?
Because they provide a thing called

transportation which is sorely need-
ed by errant young college stu-
dents —and it has been observed
that one’s popularity is greatly en-
hanced by the possession of these
machines. All you need to keep one
running is some surplus cash and

a mechanical knowledge not less
than that of the combined staff of
General Motors and Ford, Inc.

You can buy them anywhere—
at used car lots, junk heaps garages,
or filling stations. Bill Cassels was
really lucky in buying that old
Hudson that all the cheerleaders
come out in before a game. He
said that the car used to belong
to a rural postman who had bought
it when it had 10,000 miles on it.
The first time he drove it he had
two flats out on the road and a
third just before getting back to
his garage. The enraged man pushed
it inte his garage, put it up on
blocks and there it sat for 25 years
until Billy bought it.

be just as savage in one-hand touch as two-hand, and it only

takes one to kayo you.

4. Asking for cleaner play would have the same effet of
proverbial pouring on the duck’s back.

We should know something by next week. Whittle, Scott
and pow-wow will produce a remedy, bet on that. Meanwhile,
if you know a better way to stop a mouse-trap, drop in.

e Vogue;

The owners are continually
plagued by breakdowns, flat tires,
and smaller mishaps. Every after-
noon you can walk behind dormitory
row and see three or four boys
cleaning, repairing, and adjusting
their stubborn machines. The own-
ers compete continuously with one
another in trying to have the best
running car. One boy has a two
speed redr —end and a high com-
pression head on his Model “T”
Ford, and he swears it will do 70
m. p. h.
In college the disheveled old ja-
lopy, dirty and slovenly and cover-
ed with wisecracks is strictly passe.
The vogue is the neat, well kept
model that runs smoothly in spite
of its age.

side. Suddenly the lights went out,
much to the disgust of members
of the WAYS radio station staff in
in the press box, and a large rain-
bow outlined in vari-colored lights
appeared out of the darkness.

ment of “Somewhere. Over the

When the lights came on again, a
large “D” had been formed in front
of the Wildcat stands.

James C. Pfohl, Davidson Music
Director, commented that it has
been 10 or 12 years since a similar
stunt was pulled by a Davidson
band. Mr. Pfoht used a like show
when the band went to Harvard
years ago.

Mr. Moore modestly denies that
the music used is kis arrangement,
but says that he only slightly re-
vised someone else’ s work. He says
he has only seen this type of show
used in the Big Ten Conference,
the University of Illinois, in par-
ticular,

To the knowledge of both Mr.
Pfohl and Mr. Moore, no other
band in this vicinity has used this
stunt.

that is especially prevalant with
young men of our age in the trou.

dealing with the moral problems of
life.

“The indivicual” says the speak.
er in the fifth of his talks, “is lis-
tening to three voices: the voice
from without that is .the people
with whom we come in contact day
by day and who naturally have a
behavior; the voice from within,
deep influence on our manner of
our conscience; and thirdly, the
voice from above, the voice of God.”
The Voice which should take pre-
cedence often does not. Which
voice are YOU listening to?

In the concluding, talk Dr. Depp
guided the listener in answering
the question “What Can Religion
Do?” He pointed out, principally,
that religion, when actually deep-
rooted within the person, gives an
inner peace which enables him to
get along with others, but most
important it helps to get along
with himself personally.

how your father would feel.”
“Yes, Sir,” answers Howe, re-
membering that his father and Dean
Bailey were classmates and old
friends, and suddenly he feels very
embarrassed.
“What seems to be your trou.
ble, Mr. Green?” “I don’t — .”
“Are you studying enough?” “Yes-
er-yes, sir, I think so, sir.’
“Look, son, your parents are doing
without a great deal to send you
up here and I believe you should
show a little more appreciation.
Don't you think so?” “Yes —,
sir,” “Now I. want you to stop all
this playing around and get down
to work—understand? You owe it
to your parents.” “Yes, sir,” says
Howe as he stands up and begins
to leave the Dean's office in deep
humiliation. As he approaches the
door, he hears the Dean say, “All
right, Mr. Green, I'm counting on
you now. You can do better.”

That night Howe receives a tele-
phone call from home, and as he
picks up the receiver his heart is
pounding fast. After a moment's
fearful hesitation, he summons the
courage to answer.

“Hello.”

“Howe, darling! This is mother!
We just got your report today and
its wonderful!”

“Good gosh,” says Howe to him-
self. They sent the wrong report
home.”

“Oh, Howe, T can’t tell you how
proud I am of you!”

“But mother —

“Howe, that’s the finest thing
you've ever done for me. I’m go-
ing to send you a dig chocolate
cake as reward.

Three minutes pass :hus without
Howe ever getting a chance to
slip a word in edgewise. At last
with a final admonishment to write

soon and a word of love, Mom:

Green hangs up.

“Holy cow, everything’s fine now,
but wait until she finds out the
truth,” thinks Howe as he wearily
replaces the receiver.

I cannot go on. It is too much. The
spirit of Davidson is dead, and you
have killed it!”
Having partially recovered from
the initial shock of the ‘apparition,
the student, repelled at the archaic
rantings, was overcome with the
strength to reply:

“Aw drop dead, you old fossil!”

The phantom choked, cursed, and

raised the stick to strike. The stu-

dent cringed. But suddenly the
floodlights plastered the scene with
a friendly warmth, and the fiend
vanished. The student mopped his

man hat. He wondered if it had
been a dream.

“I'd better not tell anybody,” he
thought to himself. “They'd never
tbelieve me. But 1 wonder if it’s
ike the old coot said? Is Davidson
better off than before, or worse?”
With these words on his lips,
he again moved on toward his dorm,
where in the silence of his room,
unhindered by his wheeling room.
mates, he discovered for his own
satisfaction, the answer. “She’s not
worse, surely, and she may be bet.
ter, but at least she’s different. And
after all, variety is the spice.”

MUSIC WITH HANSEN ...

cause of their superior catalogue
must go along with the 45. If Vic-
tor would in its majesty condescend
to make the 7 inch LP, sense would
be restored and I, for one, would
not be convinced longer of Vic-

tor’s complete obstinacy.

Victor would lose nothing by
such a move and could only gain
respect among record collectors.
The only thing missing would be
six delicious colors and a big cen.
ter hole. The six delicious colors
might even be retained for the
benefit of those who enjoy such
things. But to those who like to
peer through spindle holes, and ad-
mittedly it is easier to do this with
the 45 than with the LP, I can only
consign them to a lifetime of peer-
ing through a record, which to
quote Irving Kolodin, is the bold
way to perpetuate those annoying
inconveniences which are common
to the 78 rpm.

go.”

Playing one of the main support-
ing roles in COMMAND DECI-
SION is Ted Daniels, who hails
from Spartanburg, S. C. Ted, a
junior at Davidson, is a member of
the Red and Black Masquers and,
the International Relations Club.
This is by no means his first ap-
pearance on the stage at David-
son. He will be remembered for
his roles in “Arsenic and Old Lace.”
“The Valiant,” and “John Loves
Mary.” In Spartanburg he has ap-
peared with the Falmetto Players
of Converse College in such plays
as “Joan of ‘Lorraine’ and “The
Corn Is Green,” having played the
male lead in the latter. He also
played in numerous high school
productions. Ted’s main interest in
the summer is in radio, a field in
which he plans to devote his time
after graduation from Davidson.

The role which Ted portrays is
that of Elmer Brockhurst, a cynical,
hardbitten war correspondent who
knows his way around anywhere,
especially among the top army
brass. This prying, snooping news-
paperman prover to be a real dif-
ficulty to the protagonist of the
play, Maj. General Dennis, whom

he hates.

always a friendly gathering of

Coca-Cola helps make these get-"

As a refreshing pause from the

gathers around—Coke belongs.
