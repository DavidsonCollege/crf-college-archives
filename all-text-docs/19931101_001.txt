Union consultants' recommendation in

By Court McBryde

Davidson College hired MPC
consultants Gail Biddisonand Tony
Hire of Washington D.C. to con-
duct market research and propose”
aplan foranew Union. They made "
their first visit to Davidson in Sep-
tember to see the College and talk
to students about the environment.

The twoconsultants took their
accumulated research about
Davidson life back to D.C. and
returned on Thursday, October 28
with a presentation of a proposed
plan for a new union. Administra-
tors, faculty, andstudents convened
in the 900 Room for two hours to
listen and respond to their assess-
ment.

Their union plan entailed cer-
tain union programs to be located
in primary and secondary centers,
with a satellite location for spe-
cific purposes.

The primary center would fit
the concept of a “student cross-
roads” which would support de-
velopmental needs of Davidson
students, cater to student social/
recreational needs, serve as acom-
pliment/alternative to Patterson
Court, and encourage student in-
teractions. The desired location
of this facility would be within the
residential zone.

Biddison and Hire suggested
that the primary center encompass
student organization offices, meet-
ing space, campus radio, living
room, game room, pub (possibly a
sports bar), performance space,
convenience store/deli, video and
equipment rental, ATM,
laundromat, and Union staff of-
fices.

The concept of a “community
crossroad” would fit the secondary
center. This entity of the union
would serve as the “front door/

public face”, a place to promote

informal academic discourse as
-well’as intéractions 3

dents, staff, faculty, and the com-
munity.

Abookstore/newsstand, elec-
tronicservice center, coffee house/
sandwich shop with outdoor patio,
ATM, study space, and adminis-
trative offices are proposed ele-
ments found in the secondary cen-
ter.

The satellite locations of the
proposed union would accommo-
date occasional activities that re-
quire large spaces and/or costly
activities such as a climbing wall
or first class bands. Its uses would
be more specific and thus the loca-
tion would not be as important.

Biddison and Hire constantly
brought up “the need to put the
Union ina location where the cam-
pus population is . ..so that people
can take advantage of what is of-
fered at that specific time of day.”
They commented that there seemed
tobea shift from the academic day

to the social life at night (Patterson
Court vs. Union); therefore, the

ELV.

Biddison and Hire gathered
that the campus needed more di-
versity, variety, and alternatives fo
Patterson Court. :

After Biddison and Hire gave
their presentation they opened the
floor for questions and discussion
about the presented idea. The con-
sultants stressed their objective for
this trip to Davidson was to solicit
reactions and obtain ideas about

‘the proposed plan.

During the open discussion a
particular concern was repeatedly
addressed. Many administrators
and students did not support the
aspect of the separation of a Union
into different buildings and loca-
tions.

Locations that were proposed
for a new Union included: the
current location, Johnston Gym,
laundry area, Vail Commons, Belk
Dormitory, and Cunningham Fine
Arts Center.

Council chair to address faculty

By Chris Frampton

Honor Council Chairman
Ward Davis will discuss the effec-
tiveness of the Honor Code with
the faculty this Tuesday.

Members of the faculty have
indicated suspicions that the Code
no longer prevents students from
cheating. According to Davis,
those faculty members who have
raised questions are concerned that
students are not reporting others
that they know have cheated.

Says Davis, "We don’t know
how many teachers are upset with
the system but we know they are
there. So we are hoping that they

Several members of the fac-
ulty are specifically distressed by
several cases that went before the
Council earlier this year and last.
However, because of the confi-
dential nature of the trial process,
their names and the students in-
volved in the cases could not be
disclosed.

For his part, Davis thinks the
Honor Code is very successful in
dealing with violations. However,
the Honor Code does require the
cooperation of all Davidson stu-
dents.

It is not unusual for the Honor

SGA challenges
Trustee church
affiliation rule

By Leigh Rawdon
“All persons elected as Trustees shall be active
members of a Christian church,” state the current
bylaws of the Davidson Trustees.
Many students find this requirement unaccept-

A movement in the SGA to address the poten-
tial changes in the Statement of Purpose, a current
issue being addressed by asmall trustee and faculty
committee, led to the discovery of this specifica-
tion. On Tuesday, SGA president Alden Smith
presented a resolution calling for the elimination of
church membership as a prerequisite for potential

tion with three senators voting “no”.

Why the recent attention?

The SGA became aware of the requirement
after a discussion in the Alumni Association board.
The Alumni board also invites only active church
members to serve as Alumni trustees.

The theoretical question arose addressing the
