LISTEN!

THERE'S
ALWAYS
A GOOD
SHOW
AWAITING
YOU
AT THE

Alhambra

About the highest compliment you can pay
a woman these days and times is to tell her
|she carries her rouge well.

In tossing the bold taurus have you ever
| stopped to think that being in love is like
|sleeping in a Pullman? No one can do it
|comfortably and some people can’t do it
lat all.
|

Pat Kimzey, from away back in the moun-
tains around Brevard, N. C., was bragging
|about the fact that he had seen an eagle
‘soar. Fresh Martin, from the pine hills of
Arkansas, stated he could see nothing so
wonderful about that. He never saw one
yet that wasn’t up in the air about some-
thing.

As we feel when our room-mate has an

alarm clock and an eight o'clock class:
“The bells of Hades go ting-a-ling-a-ling
For you but not for me.”

J. I. Smith comes along with this one
that a woman’s complexion is like a game

of poker. At seven it’s “straight.” At
17 it’s a “flush.” And from then on it’s. all
a “bluff.”

In books are many lessons that we will
never get out, and out of books there are
far many more lessons that we will never
|put in them.

A MERRY DRAMA
In Many Acts and Numberless
Scenes

Introducing “The Freshman,” or to speak
campus wise “Fresh,” a verdant member of
'26, who constantly craves information. It
is our resolution that he shall be informed.

Characters: “Mack” Lennox, a rather
prominent senior; he prides himself on the
nobbiness of .his wardrobe; it is his private
opinion that he is a veritable lady-killer.
“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and no less
prominent junior; in matter of dress, his
'taste is more conservative and substantial;
lin regard to his love affairs the old adage,
| “Still water runs deep,” is-applicable.
| Act the Third

THE TALE OF A TIE

Fresh (at dresser)—This tie looks like a
| relief map of the Rockies.
| Mac—Why so, my hearty, why so?
| Fresh—Why so? Look at it—enough
| wrinkles to keep Palmolive busy for a year.
| Mac—So ’tis—’tis so. Remind me of a
| little dityy that I heard the other day; went
like—

. Bill—Say hold it, for—

Mac—(oblivious to all else)—

Blest be the tie that binds
Our collars in mutual love.
| Fashioned of Keyes Cloth, oh, so fine,~
Of wool and silken wove.

Bill—Now that you've finished with your
) eternal rhyming listen to a practical talk.

Fresh and Mac—Say on, say on.

Bill—Was down to Charlotte the other
day and Mellon was showing ties. of that
| self-same Keyes Cloth of which you sang so
| beautifully. Leaving all jokes aside it is
some tie. Wool and silk, you know, so that
wrinkling is impossible, The colors and
combinations are good too. In fact an ideal
tie—long-wearing and good-looking to the
end and yet real neat looking. Next time
I’m down there am going to set myself up
to a couple of them.

Fresh and Mac—Lead on.

3. North Carolina is the wealthiest State,
in the South due to the fact that the average
wealth per capita of the Davidson student |
body was left out of the statistics.

4. North—Carolina holds the “put out”)
record of any State its size. Look at the
“flunkees” and “bustees” from State, Trin-
ity, Carolina and Davidson,

A great many girls say “no” at first; but
like the photographer, they know how to
retouch their negatives.

The Electric Light Shines Forth

I’m sore. For years I’ve been the butt of
every petting joke. Whenever anybody says
“Turn out the light,” the rest start to gig-
gle. As long as the family is around I go
hig; as soon as they leave I’m about as
useful as a Ford speedometer. If it wasn’t
for me this would be a gloomy world after
six o'clock, and yet college students think 1
was invented to plague them. I’m going to
strike and refuse to go out at the next house
party.

Evolution of Chivalry

Long years ago, when hoop skirts covered
a multitude of shins, and beaver hats made
man appear as though he was emerging from
a sewer pipe feet foremost, man had a
highly developed sense of chivalry. When
he passed a lady on the street in those days,
after she saw him, he demurely cast- his
eyes down. Now, however, he first glances
down and then raises his eye to confirm his
opinion,
plain this change of psychology, ~ but, be-

There’s a reason.

If Goldsmith Were Living
When lovely woman stoops to srcles
And finds too late that men betray;
What charm can soothe her melancholy?
What art can wash her guilt away?

Why she can start a breach of promise
Suit, and gaining fame untold ;

Next she can go into the movies,
And drag away a million cold.

FRESHMEN REQUIRED
TO LEARN NEW SONGS

of the freshman class was held in Shearer
Hall for the purpose of learning the song,
“Old Ship of Zion.” The. proposition to
learn the song was furnished by the court
of control.
by Bevo Davis and Johnny Adams. The
freshmen showed themselves eager to prove
their spirit and pep. On Friday night they

double lock-step.

Saturday night, just before the game, the
whole class came in together marching in
double lock-step, singing “O Davidson.” |
Later they sang “Old Ship of Zion,” making
the gym resound with the tune.

The verses are new, relating to the ath-
letic teams instead of the faculty. The
honor of composing them goes to Bob Mc-|
Leod. The new'men have proven that they
are true Davidson men by their pep and!
that they have the fighting Davidson spirit
instilled in their blood.

Following the opening songs, Bill Baker and
Albert Hilhouse led in prayer.

Doctor Crawford chose is his subject:
“Christ's Life as a Twentieth Century Life.”
Hé enumerated the characteristics of Christ’s
life that go.to make. a life of today.

“Christ lived an active life. «While all
around him there was laziness and inde-
cision, Christ was always active. He was,
busy all the time.

“A life that is not settled is lacking.
Christ’s life was settled. He had a definite |
goal toward which he always worked.

“Another great characteristic of Christ’s |
life was the bigness of it. He associated |
with all types of people, the rich, the poor, |

the young and the old, and was perfectly at|

lease with all.

Here the speaker referred to Christ’s per-

with the fallen woman, with the rich young
ruler and likewise with the beggar at the
gate of the city.

“Christ was brave. He was courageous.

Following the closing song, Doctor Rich-

first stop the thirty-four talented youths will
make their way to Converse College, where
they will make merry before their fair audi-
ence. From there they will go direct to the

tainment of the trip will be given at the
Strand Theater in Charlotte, Saturday night.

The Sultan of Sarawak is universally con-
ceded an exhibition of minstrelsy of the
highest order, far exceeding anything of its
nature ever produced at Davidson. It keeps
the entire audience in paroxysms of merri-

mént from the opening words, till after the
curtains are drawn at the end of the last
act. By theatrical connoisseurs, it is declared
the peer of any five acts ever presented on
Keith’s stage in Charlotte. Most of the
credit for the excellence of the show is due
to Professor and Mrs. Erwin, not little of it
belonging to the latter,-who has helped ma-
terially in every way. :
After the plans for this trip had been
completed, the minstrels were invited to
Columbia; S. C., to the High School and
the Greensboro College for Women in
Greensboro, N. C., to Anderson, S. C., and
to Statesville. It will be impossible to in-
clude these places in the schedule, however,
due to the shortage of time, according to
Manager Windy Aiken.
