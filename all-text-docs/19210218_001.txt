Gamma Sigma Epsilon Es-
tablishes Second
Chapter

Chemical Fraternity Founded Last
Year by Davidson Students Takes

First Step Toward Expansion

Four students of the North Carolina
State College, at West Raleigh, have
been granted a charter for the Alpha
Beta Chapter of the Gamma Sigma Ep-
silon Chemical Fraternity. They are:
R. C. Ernst, ‘21; O. H. Browne, '21; L.
W. Green, ’22, and S. F. Mauney, Jr., ‘22.
This chapter is the first to be establish-
ed, and the installation took place last
Monday night in Raleigh. M. R. Doubles
and J. R. Boulware, Jr., were the repre-
sentatives sent by the local organization
to take charge of the installation. Five
of the faculty members at the State Col-
lege were extended the privileges of
honorary membership, and they, with
the students, will make for a strong
chapter which will accomplish a great
deal toward approaching the aims for
which the fraternity was established.
These faculty members, Drs. W. A.
Withers, L. F. Williams and E. E. Ran-
dolph, and Profs. S. J. Marion and W. E.
Jordan, are all teachers of chemistry
at the State College, and interested in
the extension of that branch of science.

The Gamma Sigma Epsilon Chemical
Fraternity was organized here at Da-
vidson by L. P. Good, ‘20; M. A. Siske,
20, and M. R. Doubles, ‘22. There is a
need for an hotiorary chemical organi-
zation which will have for its field of
extension the smaller colleges, and it
was primarily for this reason that the
organization was perfected. At present
the honorary chemical fraternities will
not consider any but the larger univer-
sities as possible places for chapters.
Gamma Sigma Epsilon intends to extend
more in the smaller colleges, in the un
dergraduate departments and the forma-
tion of this new chapter at Raleigh rep-
resents the first step in its expansion.
The fraternity requires that a man must
have passed two years of college chem-
istry, with a minimum requisite grade
each term. At Davidson the grace is
85; the grades at other colleges will be
fixed in accordance with conditions
there.

The members of the chapter here at
Davidson are: Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, Prof.
O. P. Thies, J. R. Boulware, Jr., A. P.
Ormond, J. M. Duntap, J. S. Brown, Jr.,
M. R. Doubles, C. E. Cunningham, T. M.
Lowry, J. P. Price, D. W. Spencer, and
P. H. McAlpine.

The fraternity hopes in time to ex-
tend to most of the colleges in this sec-
tion of the country, and the establish-

BAND CONCERT IN SHEARER
HALL NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT

A band concert will be held Tuesday
night, February 22d, in Shearer Hall.
This date, the birthday of the Father
of our Country, was chosen as it was
thought that some sort of a ceicbra-
tion would be fitting. for that day. The
concert is to be absolutely free and all
the townspeople are invited to attend.
The students should turn out well and
back the band. Last year Band L.eader
Freeman had to take raw material and
make a band of it, but this year he had
a good many old men back and also
some good new men. As a consequence
Davidson has a band that would be a
credit to any institution. A band is a
very necessary thing in arousiny pep in
games and other activities. The sta-
dents should get behind the band and
show them how much they appreciate
their efforts. |

DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON. N. C., FEBRUARY 18. 1921.

DR. FRAZER HOOD
PREPARES VOLUME ON

DYNAMIC SALESMANSHIP

Dr. Fraser Hood, Professor of Psy-
chology, is now engaged in writing a
psychological treatise which will be en-
titled “Dynamic Salesmanship.” This is
to be published in book form, and will
give a full discussion of the psychologi-
cal principles underlying and involved
ii the art of salesmanship. Selected
illustrations showing the practical ap-
plication of psychology to the individual
problems of salesmanship will be a fea-
ture of the new book.

The material will be ready for the
printers by summer, and the book will
probably be off the press by early fall.
It will contain about 300 pages, and Dr.
Hood is contemplating using it as one
of the texts for the course in salesman-
ship which will be offered next year.

As far as is known, no Davidson pro-
fessor has ever published a book in the
department of psychology before, and
the students of the college and the
friends of Dr. Hood are delighted to
learn that he has undertaken and is so
successfully completing a work of this
nature.

Inter-Racial Problems

Helpfully Discussed Be-
fore Davidson “Y.”

Many Treats Promised
Delegates to State Vol-
unteer Convention

Excellent Program Prepared for the
150 North Carolina, Students
Who Will be Present

On February 25th, gentle reader, some
150 of the peppiest students in the State
will migrate, assemble, and in other
ways gather themselves together in Dur-
ham, N. C., for what promises to be the
livest Student Volunteer Convention on
record. I speak advisedly:

There will be a reception Friday night
in order that the delegates may all get
acquainted “right off,” so to speak, and
the fact that the delegates will eat to-
gether in the College Dining Hall is not
calctlated to diminish their interest in
one another. At night time there will
be nice, long, cool, shady waiks home,
for the college is situated in the center
of the town. And certain budding as-
tronomy sharks have calculated, by the
aid of certain government publications
called “calendars,” that the MOON will
be FULL just three days before! Such
are times that stir the heart. The re-
porter can testify that the whole course
of a man’s life can be changed by such
an experience.

The conference will be peculiarly for-
tunate this year in that the heads of

Dr. H. L. McCrory, of Biddle Uni-|threc different Mission Boards will be

Dr. Hounshell, for the Methodists, and
Dr. Atkinson, for the Christian Church.
Miss Helen Hardy, who attended the

The address at the Sunday Y service | Davidson Conventiun last year, will rep-

by Dr. H. L. McCrory, President of Bid-
dle University, of Charlotte, and the
singing of five of his students, furnished
an unusual and helpful program. These
men from Biddle. the colored Presbyte-
rian University in the South, were heard
with pleasure and profit.

After the Scripture reading by Secre-
tary Chalmers and prayer by Dr. Sen-
telle, the Biddle quintette sang “A Wit-
ness for My Lord,” “Lord, I Want to be
a Christian,” and “Good News, the
Chariot’s Come.” Though the students
would gladly have heard more, they gave
the singers a rest until after the address,
when three more songs were given and
then two more after the regular mect-
ing closed.

Dr. J. M. McConnell, of the faculty,
in introducing the speaker, called to
mind the fine efforts made by the col-
ored race to better themselves during
the time they have been coming “up
from slavery,” and the fact that the
white people of the South are the most
sympathetic toward the negro and the
most interested in his betterment.

Dr. McCrory, after paying his re-
spects to Davidson College, of which he
had heard when he was a boy in South
Carolina, told of his association of a
third of a century with Biddle, and said
that he “wouldn’t change the work of
teaching the young men who are becom-
ing citizens in this country for any other
work.” He announced that he would
confine his discussion of inter-racial re-
lations to the relations between the
white and black races in the United
States, and would center upon the pos-
sibilities, future, and problems of the
negro. He expressed the opinion that
it is not possible for the negro to leave
this country, and that it would be diffi-
cult for him to colonize in this country,
on account of the intertwined depend-
ency of the two races. Then, as the
solution does not seem to be found in
getting rid of the negro, his problems
must be considered in the light of his
presence here now and in the days
ahead. .

The speaker mentioned two causes of

Missions. The Student Volunteer Sec-
retary will be E. F. Campbell, of whom
we are advised that we may say any-
thing we wish and not have to take any-
thing back.

In addition, missionaries wilt be there
from all the mission fields, Rev. S. M.
Erickson and J. W. Moore being our
representatives. At least two of the
meetings will be conducted entirely by
the students themselves, Davidson men
being among the speakers.

Be advised! Turn in your names at

Promoter of this meeting, as ten of the

ready full. The railroad fare is nine

Davidson Basketeers

Leave for Trip Thru
Old North State

Elon and N. C. State to be Encount-
ered for Second Time—U. of
N. C Also to be Met

The Wildcat Basketeers left Wednes-
day noon for their North Carolina trip.
Three games will be played before their
return and they have high hopes of
winning all of them.

The first game, with Elon, was played
Wednesday night. The second game
will be played tonight with N. C. State.
State is out for revenge for the bad way
the Wildcats defeated them here some
time ago. On that occasion the Presby-
terians came out on the long end of a
45-13 score. But with N. C. State play-
ing in her own back yard, supported by
hundreds of Red and White rooters,
there is likely to be a different tale to
tell. Coach Hengeveld’s men are sure

DAVIDSON GLEE CLUB TAKES
SIX-DAY TRIP.

—__.,

The Davidson College Glee Club is
now on a six-day trip performing at
towns in the western part of the state.
The places visited are Queens College,
Salem College, Lexington High School,
Asheville High School, and Fassifern
School at Hendersonville, returning here
on Saturday. .

Twelve numbers of popular college
songs, quartets and sketches including
the famous “Wildcat” Jazz Orchestra
make up the program which is being
rendered in fine style. :

The popular songs such as, “Tell Mc
Little Gypsy,” “Dry as a Camel’s Ton-
sils,” “Broadway Rose,” “Margie” and
“I Love the Land of Old Black Joe,” ren-
dered by the whole club are making a
big hit.

Allison is also winning the hearts of
many with his solos, while the “Wild-
cat" Jazz Orchestra is running him and
the whole club a close second.

Much praise should be given Mrs.
Frazer Hood for her untiring efforts
in helping to make the Glee Club such
a success.

DD
Junior Oratorical Exer-
cises Begin Next
Monday
More Than Eighty Students to Display

Their Knowledge on the
World’s Problems

“The time has come” the Walrus said,
“to talk of many things.” This quota-
tion, while not very new nor yet pro-
found, is a good statement of the con-
dition which will prevail at Davidson
during the next week. Junior Speaking
with all its trials and sorrows is to be-
gin next Monday.

A different plan is to be followed
from that which hag prevailed in pre-
vious years. Instead of torturing large
audiences with their eloquence, the
Juniors will speak before committees of
the faculty. Several sections will be
heard at the same time in the various
places of assembly, and cight of the
best speakers from each society are to
be selected to speak at the formal or-
atorical contest in March.

While there is no evidence that the
students will talk of “cabbages and
kings,” there is almost as great a range
of subjects to be found in the titles an-
nounced for the speeches. Everything
from the Modern Dance to the Purifi-
cation of Water and from the Farmers’
Union to the Voice of the City is to be

discussed. The following is a list of
speakers and the subjects of their
orations:
Bailey, H. P., The Value of the
Classics.

Bailey, J. C., Home Ownership.

Bailey, T. M., Business Possibilities
for 1921.

Bethea, P. O., Progress of America.

Bitzer, R., Optimism.

Booth, W. R., A People without a Na-
tion.

Brice, R. M., Use of Economics to the
Average Citizen.

Clark, J. F., Ideals.

Clyburn, T. B., Prepare for the Crisis.

Cornelson, G. H., Thread.

Crane, W. E., Korea.

Cunningham, C. E., The Greatest Man
in America.

Curry, J. S., What Next?

Deaver, R. R., The Need of the Un-
dergratuate.
Dew, M. C., An Audience with Kings.
Dick, L. W., Woodrow Wilson.
Doggett, M. W., A Model Town.
Doubles, M. R., Why?
Erwin, M. M., Science vs. Art.

Wildcats Win from Elon
and Univ. of Florida

Red sd White Loos by Scare of 38
to Alligators Vanquishe
45 to 26 in Rough Game

Elon Game.

The Red and White succumed to the
Red and Black a week ago last Tues-
day night to the tune of 38 to 25.

Elon opened up a rapid-fire attack
which netted them seven points before
the Davidson five could find their bear-
ings.

Warming up to the game the Wild-
cats came back strong however, catch-
ing up with their opponents and gain-
ing the lead before the first half ended
with a score of 16 to 14 in their favor.

Opening up the second half with re-
newed pep Elon again showed strong
fight and with accurate passing and
fast floor work threatened to pass the
Davidsonians again, but were unable to
hold the lead for long.

Roberts turned the ball loose and
caged five goals during this period win-
ning the Wildcats’ score well ahead of
their opponents. The close guarding of
L. Schenck and the floor work passing
and long shots by Crawford were clear-
ly the main features of the game.

J. Newman netted the most points for
the visitors and aided by B. Johnson
who did well at center and Perry, their
out-standing guard, kept Elon from be-
ing an casy mark for the Red and
Black machine.

The game was unusually fast at the
first part of each period, but both teams
slowed down somewhat toward the
last, 1K Ein showing more endurance

than the Elon five.
