In order to: conduct. the
sion. Institute of the Y. M. GC. A,
Dr. Donald W. Richardson, former

missionary to China and now professor
at Union Theological Seminary, will be
in Davidson next Sunday, Monday and
Tuesday, during which time he will make
a number of addresses including an open
address in Shearer Hall on Monday night.
He will also preach in Church, speak at
vespers, and to a joint meeting of the
Ministerial and Volunteer Bands on Sun-
day afternoon at one-thirty. These sery+
ices will take the place of the spring
evangelistic program usually conducted by
the Y. M. C. A.; their purpose is to instill
the spirit of missions into the student
body and appeal for the dedication of
lives to full-time Christian work.

Doctor Richardson, a native of South
Carolina, graduated from Davidson in
1902, While here he was a leader in
literary, forensic and religious fields. He
was president of his class, vice-president
of both Y. M. C. A. and the Student
Body, editor-in-chief of both the David-
sonian and the Annual, president of the
Eumenean Literary Society, and orator
at Commencement. He later attended
Johns Hopkins University and Prince-
ton Theological Seminary and studied in
the Universities of Berlin and Marburg.

Upon his return to the United States
he became pastor at Gree, S. C. In 1910
he received an appointment as a mission-
ary of the Southern Presbyterian Church
to the North China Mission as Principal
of the Boy's School at Chinkiang. His
unusual qualification for the office were
soon recognized and it was not long
before he was looked upon as one of the
outstanding Christian teacliers in China.
Since 1919 he has been the Profesor of
New Testament Interpretation in Nank-
ing Seminary, vice-president and
dean of the school. Nanking Seminary
was closed with the evacuation of Nank-

Charlie Myers, pastor of the First Pres-

of Nelson Myers, who talked on the stib- |

Doctor Myers spoke of the age in

But throughout the centur-|
ies man has not changed as far as human
personality is concerned. Therefore with
all these gifts and advantages which we
enjoy, we should be willing to let God
use them and us as He wishes. There
is no gift which God cannot use, if one
is willing to consecrate himself.

There
is a niche for everyone according to God's
plan.

If one goes into the ministry he must
have a real calling of the Lord and must
have a genuine love for other people |

F. D. Miller Winner
Of Junior Speaking

On March 27, F. D. Miller won the
annual Junior Speaking contest which |
was held in Shearer Hall. The topic of |
the winning speech “The Private |
in the Ranks.” Miller won over two op-
ponents by a very close decision.

The other two contestants were T. R.
Nunan, who spoke on the “Life of Dwight
L. Moody,” and E. E: Marsh whose sub-
ject was “The Prevention of War.” Dr.
C.-K. Brown, Prof. A. Currie, and Prof.
E. J. Erwin, acted as judges.

This part of the Junior Speaking’ prp-
gram was in previcus years the principal
event and all members of the Junior Class
took part in it. But of late the interest
has changed to social part of the pro-

Dr. Frazer Speaker
At Y. M. C. A. Vespers

President of Queens College
Talks on “The Steps in
Abraham’s Faith”

“The Steps in Abraham's Faith’ was
the subject upon which Dr. W. H. Frazer,
President of Queens College, addressed
the members of the Davidson Y. M. C.
A, at vespers Sunday evening in Shearer
Hall.

The speaker first related an incident
of several men lost in the wilds finding
safety through following footprints in the
snow. He compared this to the way that
Abraham and all true followers of God
must follow certain footsteps in faith if
they would find salvation.

The first of these footsteps as exem-
plified in the life of Abraham was obed-
ience to God. This grand old patriarch
never hesitated to follow God's command
regardless of any cost to himself. If we
century would follow
world of today would
be transformed in all its main life rela-
tionships. But most of us seek a short
cut to happiness through following -our
own desires, which is a plan that can
result only in failure whether we are
seeking happiness or self-realization.

Resignation was the second step it
Abraham's faith, and is one of the most
tests. The ability to
submit to the will of God when worldly
possessions, fame, or honor are being
swept away is the acid test of a man's
religion.
