Dana: Brown Shoes At Formal Dance

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Asst. Sports Editor

Stan Smith, probably Amer-
ica’s best tennis player, wears
a mustache. Frank Dana, David-
son tennis player, also wears a
mustache.

The similarity between these
men ends there. Smith stands
six feet four inches tall, and
his rangy body enables him to

patrol the court with seemingly
eflortless power.
Dana,

on the other hand, is a

mere 5’6” and 145 pounds, and
because of his physical limita-
tions, he has had to take an ap-
proach to the game which al-
lows him to make the most of
his abilities.

Compared to the free-wheel-
ing, overpowering style of play
which characterizes taller net-
ters, Dana’s game resembles a
pair of brown shoes at a formal
dance.

There is nothing flashy about
his pesky defense and precise

strokes, and his form is always
measured and calculated.

Dana credits Coach Harry Fo-
gleman with much of the devel-
opment of his game, particular-
ly from the standpoint of strat-
egy.

“Since I'm so short I can't
play the strong serve-and-volley
game effectively. I have to wait
for a good opportunity to make
an aggressive move. Coach Fo-
gleman has helped me a lot on
my overhead shot, and I can
get it in consistently now.”

“I’ve been vulnerable to the
lob, and I need a strong over-
head to make up for that. My
basic shots are stronger now,
and I can also volley better
than when I came here,” he
explained.

Fogleman
patience as
his game.

“Frank is like a human bank-
ing board because he hits near-
ly everything back. He has be-
come more aggressive at the
net, and he runs so much and
gives it everything he has on
each shot. It's to his advantage
to Walt for his opponent to com
mit an error.”

The diminutive Dana serves
as cocaptain of the tennis
squad. and is the cnly senior on
the relatively inexperienced
team.

He has

pointed to Dana's
a strong aspect of

been on the
since his) freshman
has been unable
top six with any frequency.
Fogleman noted that Dana
“had to play behind a lot of

squad
veur, but
to crack the

outstanding talent the past two,
years. bu: I hope he can hold
down the fifth or sixth position
for us ‘th.s season. I'm. confi-

dent he can win there,” he add-
ed.

Dana occupied the number
six slot in the netters’ 8-1 loss
to Cincinnati last Saturday, and
also against Dartmouth} last
Wednesday. The Cats were be-
hind 4-2 when rain washed out
that match.

Despite losing to both his op-
ponents, Dana was encouraged
by his play.

“Against Dartmouth I felt
more relaxed than before. My
game is almost ready now, but

I'm not quite there yet,” he ex-
plained.

Fogleman commented that
Dana was _ nicknamed ‘“‘Little

General” as a sophomore, and
the name has stayed with him.
“The guys called him that be-
cause he could get everyone
else dates,” Fogleman elaborat-
ed, ‘“‘and it seems that every
time we play on the road Frank
knows a girl there.”

Perhaps the greatest Frank
Dana quote occurred on an éve-
ning when some students were
planning to go to the movie ‘A
Clockwork Orange.”

Dana unassumingly inquired,
“Is that a new rock group?”

The netters carried an 0-3

thark into yesterday’s match
With Miami (Ohio). Tomorrow
they entertain a strong East
Stroudsburg team from a school
dominated by prospective phys-
ical education teachers in Penn-
sylvania.

The always tough squad from

MIT visits the netters next
Tuesday.
Fogleman will use these

maiches to experiment with dif-
ferent doubles combinations.
“I’m not satisfied with our
doubles play, and I want to get
the teams set before our con-
ference play begins,” he stated.
“With the excepticn of our
number one man David Weav-
er, the other guys are about
equal in ability. I try to go with
the players who are making the
fewest errors,” he explained.

Fogleman mentioned sopho-
more Gary Bressler as possibly
the netter showing the most
improvement thus far. Bressler
has seen action at the third,
fourth and fifth courts.

“We are still making a lot of
costly mistakes, but I think we'll
come around soon. There are
really no easy matches on our
schedule.” Fogieman added.
