Returns of Carolina Game

Eleven ripping, snarling, charging

Wildcats fought with their backs tothe |

wall last Saturday, valiantly defending
their goal-line from the atacks of a
veritable onslaught of weight. It was
&@ great game, and an event long to be
remembered. The two field goals booted
through the goal-posts by Hackney,
Carolina’s superkicker, in the last few
minutes of the hitherto scoreless battle,
won for Carolina a game that brought
glory to both teams.

Carolina fought hard, and won! But,
the battle was not a one-sided affair in
any way. It was a wonderful exhibition
of football, and Davidson was defeated,
but the Wildcats died game, literally
“going down with their boots on,” fight-
ing desperately to the last.

Carolina has a great team, and there
are few in the South that will find them-
selves able to beat the Blue and White
eleven at straight football. With a suf-
ficiently heavy line, and a speedy back-
field, Carolina has a team that is bring-
ing glory to the University it represents.
The Carolina players were in there all
the time, fighting just as hard as the
Wildcats, and their fine playing was re-
warded in the last few minutes of the
fatal last quarter.

It was a colorful crowd that witnessed
the encounter, and they found the game

fully as good as they could have expect- |

ed. The 5,500 seats in the stands were
filled to overflowing, and the sidelines
were crowded with supporters of both
elevens. Every available nook and cor-
ner was occupied. R. O. T. C. guards,
ushers, and the Charlotte policemen who
were on hand for the fray were kept
Susy guarding the sidelines, and keeping
the surging mass of people from crowd-
ing onto the field. The spectators were

unusually orderly, and only once did the |

game have to be delayed until the crowds
were forced back into the stands. That
came in the fourth quarter when Caro-
lina was making the remarkable charge
into Davidson's territory, that brought
her victory. The supporters of the Caro-
lina team, as well as those of the David-
son squad, had watched the game with
breathless attention for three long quar-
ters, and the strain was just too great.
Tt was a nerve-raking affair, There, the
Blue and White gridiron stars were
gaining ground, and the Davidson line
and secondary defense were fighting with
extraordinary*fury. It was too much!

The fans could hold themselves no long- |

er, and in a frenzy of excitement they
rushed onto the far end of the field, in
an effort to see more of the thrilling
rally. Only a few seconds were lost,
however, since the crowds readily re-
sumed their seats.

The new scoreboard, designed by Kuy-
kendall, was a welcomed addition to
Richardson Field. Offering to the fans
the opportunity of taking in-all the de-
tails of the game at a glance, was a big
asset. The board will probably be a
permanent affair from now on, and it
certainly should be. It is one of the
most complete of its kind in the South,
and gives the exact details during every
second of the game. The spectators
found it a great aid in following the in-
tricate plays and positions during the
game.

Davidson alumni back for Homecom-
ing Day, found the campus full of wel-
come. The old grads were here in large
numbers, renewing their acquaintances,
and making new friends, They had hoped
to see Davidson add another victory to
her long list of successful battles, but
they couldn’t have been disappointed in
the showing the Wildcats made.

The band, under the able leadership of
Band-directory Lacock, of Fort Bragg,
made an excellent showing.. Their play-
ing before and during the game was
greatly appreciated by the crowds, and
added zest to the occasion. Their drills
during the intermission of the game was
vigorously applauded by both Carolina
and Davidson followers.

And the Wildcat was there with his
colors on! In a wire-cage, decorated
profusely in Davidson colors, he oc-
cupied a place of Prominence on the
Davidson side of' the field, and his pres-
ence attracted no little attention.

| “Simp” Bryant and his assistants, lead-
jing the students in numerous yells, were
ifull of pep; and the impression made by
the Davidson rooters was remarkable.
| Numerous commendations were made in
|the newspapers of the state for the fine
|sportsmanship shown by the Davidson
|stands. Bailey @roome, of the Charlotte
Observer, carried in his special. column
in the Sunday Observer a letter from D.
|B. Smith, a former student at Carolina;
and the letter was full of praise for
| Davidson’s sportsmanship. He commend-
led the courteous, cordial, and sportsman-
\like treatment of the Carolina team by
the Davidson rooters.

i _
Threatening clouds, that had loomed
jon the horizon for several days, were
|caught in a stiff breeze just a few hours
| before the great conflict; and for an hour
or more it seemed certain that old Jup-
iter Pluvius was ready to step in and
interfere with the plans for the after-
noon, But, the thousands of fans°who
had gathered from all sections of the
|state to witness the game didn't allow
|the dismal skies to dampen their ardor,
land they poured through the turnstiles
jand into the stands by hundreds, A few
minutes before the game Old Sol Blinked
jonce or twice from behind the heavy
| clouds, and witha flurry of rays drove the
| clouds away, scattering them in all direc-
tions, With the disappearance of the
|rain-laden clouds, the afternoon turned

out to be a fine one for football. A cool,
| brisk wind, singing through the pines on
ithe eastern border of the field, came
| whistling down across the stands, send-
ling the blood tingling to the cheeks of
ithe spectators. It was just cool enough
jto make the players move about with
pep and vigor, and not too hot for the
| followers of the two teams to yell and
| spring about to their hearts’ content.

| Carolina's coaches, Bob and Bill Fet-
jzer, both of them Davidson graduates
jand former Wildcat athletes, were ac-
lcorded a signal recognition by the David-
|son students, when they offered a clear,
| pertetrating yell for the two famous sons
jof Davidson.

“Fire,” in abundance, was present in
}both the Carolina and Davidson stands,
jand during the time between halves, the
| students took advantage of the opportu-
nity to feast their eyes on the smiling
|countenances of the
;damsels in our fair Southland.

Local Body Represented
By Active Deputations

Last Sunday four deputations were
sent out by the Ministerial Band, The
men on these deputations spoke at seven
meetings, and at five different churches.

Hayden Hollingsworth, Yancey Bowie,
Glenn Eddington, and Joe Garrison sup-
plicd the, pulpit of the Presbyterian
Church at Kannapolis for Rev. Mr.
Jamison. At the morning service Bowie
and Hollingsworth spoke, while Garrison
and Hollingsworth took charge of the
evening service. All four spoke at the
meeting of the young people in the af-
ternoon. The meeting of the Christian
Endeavor Society was combined with the
evening service.

W. G. Thomas, who preached “at
Barium Springs, reports a splendid dep-
utation. He states that the new pastor
of the church at Barium is expected on
the last Sunday in November.

Fred Hopkins and J. M. Murchison
preached at’ the morning and evening
services at Concord Tredell Church, at
Loray, N. C., and in the afternoon went
out to Fifth Creek where they again
spoke. :

The service at Shearer Chapel was
held by Burns Gibbs. The Ministerial
Band is supplying this pulpit twice a
month in the absence of the pastor, who
divides his time between two churches.

Joe Garrison, chairman of the deputa-
tions reports good success with deputa-
tions so far this year, and states that
he expects this to be a banner year in
this branch of the work.

A not impossible development is that
the Carolina team will be the champions
of the state. Should State win out over
Wake Forest, and though doped not to
do this they will if they play as in the
third quarter in Pinehurst, Carolina will
automatically become State champs.
With victories~over three of the “big
five” and a one point defeat by Wake
Forest, Coah Feezer’s men would’ then
rank ahead of ‘the Baptists with their
two victories and one defeat.

Happy Yuletide, dear people,
Happy Yuletide to you!” :
Rideau (sheet-iron).
