an annual affair considered by

: The team's top finisher, plac-

exemplify Koller’s high hopes
for this year’s team, which he
has termed “the. best ever at
Davidson’.

The second finisher was Jeff

and fifth squad places were |

taken by Danny Armistead and
John Rees, respectively, both

Although igh Davidson fields the
only cross-country team: in the
Southern Conference devoid of
scholarship athletes, Koller an-
ticipates.a winning season due
to excellent depth, high morale,
and a.rigid training program
dating back to August 27, when
12 runners, inchiding six letter-
men, attended preseason train-
ing camp, averaging fifteen
miles of tough running each

zane team has continued
training up to and through the
Duke meet, readying them-
selves for the Stone Mountain
Invitational in Atlanta this
saturday. The team will be in a
dual meet against Georgia State
at the Invitational, which
boasts over 800 runners from
many schools.

“It will be a big disappoint-
ment to me if we lose,’ says
Koller,“‘since we defeated Ge-
orgia State twice last year.”
tHe also expects to equal all of
last year’s five wins in only
three weeks. If the team accom-
plishes that feat, then a winning
season will be nearly clinched.
