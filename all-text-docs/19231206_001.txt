analysis of the change in a man resulting
from the touch of Jesus. Using the ineident

in the fourth chapter of John, he applied the

“Before every great nation-wide change

there has come a change in some person's
life. When a nan is changed he goes out
to reach others.” Mr. Gordon continued
with the example of D. L. Moody and John
R. Mott, both of whom owed a life of great
usctulness to some individual who had taken
a direct interest in them, and said he, “Christ
is looking today for the man who will al-
