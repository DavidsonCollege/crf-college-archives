You can read of Gunga Din
sweating in “Inja’s sunny clime,”
but there are guys on this campus
who each Friday night exude more

after supper and many of the fel-
lows had dates and could not stay.
Five men showed up and began the
long and arduous task, knowing

perspiration than Gunga ever
thought about. They do it withou:
benefit of being sung in poetry, too.

These fellows have about the
meanest job on the campus and
they get absolutely nothing for it.
Who are these unsting laborers?
They are the men who week after
week drop whatever else they are
doing to fold and deliver The Da-
vidsonian to every room on the cam-
pus.

Theirs is an extra curricular
activity without peer. Any other
job around here at least happens
at a set time, but there's tever
any telling just when the press
will begin to bump for the last
time.

Each week the local printing shop
vibrates to the great thumping
strokes of its priiiting press as it
kicks out. some 1300 copies of your
newspaper.

It’s’ up to the folding crews
to grab these off the press, fold
each one two ways, count and
deliver the lot to dormitory,
YMCA, faculty boxes and mail-
ing room.

Head of these nimble-fingered
and ‘silent workers is Bob Poston
whose official title is Circulation
Manager, but whose abilities in-
clude the patience of four Jobs,

tor sneer, but the amaging
thing is that he does get them
and consistently so.

Poston’s is a job which draws a
rather plump pay check on most
campuses in the U.S. but he
usually gets not even a hearty
thanks from the finicky editorial
staff. It's a job not many guys
would stick out for a week much
less an entire school year.

A step down the ladder are
Poston’s team captains Don
Wilkins, Ed Blanton, Gene
Witherspoon and Angus Ha-
gins. Each of these men has a
list of students who have
volunteered to told one night
every three weeks. That reads
fine, but rounding the volun-
teers up is quite another matter.

These are the fellows who have
the impossible job of asking the
impatient folders to “come back in
a little while’ when presstime is
held up by an editorial or compo-
sitional change.

The trouble is that this man-

Can Keep

security

Without NewTaxes

Expenses for national security can be held down without
hurting the defense or foreign-aid programs, according to the

Research and Policy Committee

of the Committee for Economic

Development, national organization of businessmen and educators.

In its latest report, issued after
a searching study of the budget
proposed for the fiscab year which
begins July 1, the group said the
$10.4 billion cash deficit indicated
in the President’s budget message
can be eliminated without raising
taxes or damaging the security pro-
grams, A deficit “would increase the
risk of futher inflation, with serious
injury to the nation,” the commit-
tee warned.

Its finding were based on:

1. A calculation that actual ex-
penditures for military functions of
the Defense Department and for
foreign military aid will lag at least
$3.5 billion behind the President’s
estimate of $58 billion, “even as-
suming adoption of the whole presi-
dential program.”

2. An estimate that another $4
billion can be saved by eliminating
waste and inefficiency in the mili-
tary programs.

« 3. Recommendations that about
$2.8 billion be cut from the $26.7
billion proposed for other than mili-
tary and foreign aid expenditures.
The committee took the po-
sition, however, that if Con-
gress reached a different con-
clusion, leaving expenditures
substantially higher than pros-
pective revenue, the budget
should be balanced “by a tem-
porary tax on retail sales, ex-
cept sales of food, housing and
items already subject to direct

Federal exercies. This way of

financing the excess of expen-

ditures would be lese inflation-
ary and less injurious to pro-
duction than any alternative.”

“We believe that the world sit-
uation requires a rapid buildup of
our own military forces and assist-
ance to friendly nations in building
up their military and economic
strength,” the committee said. “It
is our belief that if the proposed
programs are necessary for our
reasonable security they should not
be curtailed by the thought that
our national economy cannot bear
them, But ... it is obviously essen-

tial to avoid waste in the execution
even of necessary programs.”

“We also believe,” the commit-
tee went on, “that foreign assist-
ance is as necessary to our own
security as is our own military pro-
gram. The components of both the
foreign assistance program and our
own military program should be
objectively examined from the
standpoint of usefulness and ef-
ficiency.

But this examination should not
assume that a dollar spent for
foreign assistance is less essential
to our security than a dollar spent
for our own forces.”

Acknowledging that “the
possibilities of action this year
to improve the tax system are
narrowly limited,’” the commit-
tee said that it is nevertheless
“time to begin a national re-
consideration of the principles
of taxation.”

The Research and Policy Com-
mittee noted that since 1944 it “has
repeatedly pointed out the need for
reform of the Federal tax system
to make it more equitable and less
repressive of productive efficiency
and economic growth.” It suggested
that the Congressional Joint Com-
mittee on International Revenue
Taxation initiate a study of the tax
structure,

No one else in the wortd would
turn out to stand some one and
one-half hours on his feet method-
ically folding and counting news-
papers for absolutely no recogni-
tion.

Last week is a good illustration
of how this thing is carried on.
Team Captain Hagins showed up
at 4:30 p.m., at which time he had
been promised he could have his
men start folding in plenty of time
to make the D-Club Foolies.

He was told to wait an hour
and the folders who came with
him sighed knowing this was
just the first of a series of de-
lays that might hold them up
until 12 that night. But they
came back in an hour.

This coming back kept up until

The fraternity hopes to make this

project an annual one on the Da-

ticular rank of scouting is neces-

maybe even the dance, but they
showed up any way. Call it what
you will, they showed up.

Working fast they had the
papers ready for delivery by
6:30 and one lit out with papers
for the village, YMCA, Watts
and Georgia. Hagins and a
helper piled the papers into his
car and raced for fraternity
court to get the sheets in the
frat houses by the time the
Greeks and their dates arrived
before going to the dance.

Luck was with them and they
found Dean Bailey in his office with
a key to the alumni office. The
faculty got their papers on time
when they arrived Saturday morn-
ing.

This was just one weekend.
The story has been repeated
time after time with individual
sacrifice the usual instead of
the exceptional feature. The
men have gone out in rain and
bitter cold to get their time-
bound burdens delivered.

So that’s the background for the
guy who knocks on your door on
Friday nights to bring “that paper
again.” Whether it’s Friday eve-
ning or late that night, you can
bet that last buck it’s been no
pushover for him.
