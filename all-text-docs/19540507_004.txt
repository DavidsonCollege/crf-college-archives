THE DAVIDSONIAN

Professor Recalls Years
Of May 20 Celebration

In connection with President
Elsenhower’s visit to Charlotte
May 18, to take part in the
celebration of the signing of
the Mecklenburg Declaration
of Independence, Dr. Chalmers
G. Davidson has written the
following article on the in-
, tegral connection of the col-
lege with this celebration
through the years.—Ed.

The students at Davidson Col-
lege in the old days celebrated the
Mecklenburg Declaration with a
holiday jaunt to the village of
Charlotte. There were no classes
on May 20th and both faculty mem-
bers and collegiates participated
in the patriotic festivities.

As Davidson was not founded
until 1837, it had no part in the
great celebrations prior to that
date. Those of 1825 and 1835 were
especially notable. The mention of
the “college green” in these cele-
brations refers to the old Queens
College from which Davidson is in-
directly descended, it being to all
intents and purposes a Presby-
terian school for boys locally sup-
ported.

In the days before the War be-
tween the States, Davidson was
more closely identified with Meck-
lenburg County than the cosmo-
politan institution of today. The
early class rolis abound iin Alex-
anders, Brevards, Davidsons. Mor-
risons, Grahams, Phifers, Irwins,
Polks, Reeses, Harrises and Barrys.
These boys had heard from their
fathers and grandfathers first hand
accounts of the stirring events of
the Revolution.

They were familiar with the de-
tails of the controversy over the
date on which the declaration was
promulgated. The newspapers of
the time were full of articles on
this subject and the State of North
Carolina issued an official pamph-
let in 1831 publishing all the evi-
dence available with respect to
May 20.

Sectional feeling had developed
to such an extent that many con-
sidered it a matter of patriotism to
celebrate May 20th in preference
to July 4th, overlooking the fact
that the earliest local declaration
and the national declaration later
contained no point of conflict.

mind, the faculty minutes of David-
son record on July 2, 1860, that
Professor Rockwell objected to
giving a holiday on July 4th (col-
lege then ran through the summer)
on the grounds that May 20th had
already been celebrated and two
holidays were not customary.

The Faculty Resolves

Up to 1858, it appears from
faculty minutes that students must
make a request for a holiday on
May 20th before it was granted,
but on November 15, 1858 the
faculty “resolved that there be a
junior exhibition on the 20th of
May hereafter as a regular custom:
the exercises to consist of original
speeches and declarations, which
will be distributed according to
scholarships as determined by the
preceding semiannual examination
in February, original speeches
being assigned to those whose
standing is 95 or above, the
declamation to those between 95
and 92,”

The greatest celebration, of
course, was the Centennial of May
20, 1875. In April of that year the
faculty resolved that a holiday be
granted and that the students be
permitted to assist in the Centen-
nial celebration. Evidently the local
exhibition: previously decreed was
omitted. The two literary societies,
the Eumanean and the Philan-
thropic, even debated making a
financial contribution to the cen-
tennial celebration but (these being
Reconstruction days) decided that
the state of their exchequers was
too low to: admit it.

They did, however, participate
whole-heartedly in the revelry:
The minutes of the Eumanean
Society on the following day (May
21) note that “the speeches showed
the result of too great interest in
the centennial.” The same society
debated a few weeks earlier the
question “should the South par-
ticipate in the Centennial celebra-
tion at Philadelphia on July 4,
1876." The result of the debate is
not given but it is significant to
find students interested in such
a topic. .

out the nineteenth century. Pro-

“MISSION OVER

Belk Home for Weary
Continues To Rise

Sixty-one experienced laborers
are working feverishly five and a
half days a week in order to finish
the new Belk haven of rest by the
first of February, 1955.

Just today 30 all-round handy
men, 20 bricklayers, 6 plumbers.
3 electricians, and 2 steel special.
ists finished pouring concrete for
‘the first floor. As work is now 10
days ahead of schedule, it is be-
lieved that 3 stories will be com-
pleted in 10 weeks.

The massive structure, which will
be six stories high from the laun-
dry angle, will be completely con-
crete and brick. The ROTC depart-
ment has reconnoitered the under-
ground areas of this fireproof
Triple-A monster, and has decided
to occupy these particular floors
for its own special purposes.

Luxury-loving Davidson gentle-
men will be distressed to learn
that the building will have neither
elevators, escalators, nor air-condi-
tioning, but they will be relieved
to find that there will be two
large baths on each floor.

One innovation about which the
administration is especially estatic
is battleship linoleum, one-eighth
inch in depth, which will be used
on all floors. Fun-loving students
will enjoy the telephone call sys-
tem, for it will enable them to
play pranks on their friends, and
no one will ever know who buzzed.

Anyone who needs to be con-
vineed that work is being carried
on at a noisy and accelerated pace
has only to try to get an afternoon
snooze on the north end of East,
West. Georgia, or Watts dormi-
tories.

But a much easier way to be
certain that progress is being made
is to take a careful look at Mrs.
Little. The big smile with which
she greets you gives definite proof
that Belk is daily coming nearer
to completion.

conformity in some areas, but even
taking into account the necessary

There would appear to be an

excellent opportunity for meet-

This is only one aspect of a
broad area on which there needs
to be concentrated student, faculty,
administration, and trustee inves-
tigation and action.

The faculty has had two com-
mittees working on the problem
for some time, and it will be in-

back and see which way Davidson
goes in her educational direction.
