Seven of the Davidson stu-
dents ranked in the top 1000 and
four ranked in the top 500 Ac-
ording to Klein. “No other
North Carolina institution had
more than two contestants in
the top 300

Discussing the role of the
Mathematics department in the
test results. Klein said. ‘‘I feel
that this test reveals the quality
of the students themselves as
opposed to the department. The
credit should definitely go to the
Students."

The Putnam Competition is
usually an accurate indicator of
future success in the field of
mathematics. ‘In the past. the
list of the people who have won
the competition could serve as
an honor roi) for distinguished
mathematicians. It is a

distinguished contest for
distinguished people.’
remarked Klein.

In preparation for the test
Davidson students had only one
short orientation session which
dealt with a discussion of the
type of problems to be tested on.
According to Klein. ‘Such
schools as MIT and Cal Tech
pick their top students and put
them through intensive
preparation for the test.”

Klein is optimistic towards
the future success of Davidson
in the annual competition
“Only two seniors from David-
son participated this vear. all
the others were juniors or
sophomores This should result
in even better rankings next
vear. “he predicted

LSAT seems to be better this
year. Rough figures indicate
that two-thirds of the students
scored over 550 and one -half
scored over 600 on the LSAT.”
Minter said

Last year of the 45 semors
who applied to law school, 35
were accepted. which meant
that the admission rate of
Davidson students was better
than 70 percent

This also means that one out
of every seven Davidson seniors
are attending Law School after
graduation

According to statistics of the
Law School Admission Testing
Center. there will be ap-
proximately 120.000 LSAT can-
didates competing for less than
36.000 positions in law schools
this vear

These figures are in sharp
contrast to those for 1962 which

show that 26.000 candidates
were trying for over 18,000
openings

In order to help advise
students about law school
requirements and a legal ca-
reer. a pre-law program is in
operation at Davidson. At
present 150 upperclassmen and
77 freshmen indicate law as an
occupational choice.

Besides counseling, the Pre-
Law program has offered a
series of meetings with mem-

bers of the legal profession who
discuss career opportunities
and experiences in the various
fields of law

“Pre-law curriculum and
training cannot be subject to as
much direction and control as is
true of pre-medical education.
where medical schools are
more precise in their
requirements.’ said Minter

He pointed out that law
schools do not require in-
terviews. and that they en-

courage taking a broad range of
courses

Pre-law advisers must deal
with each student as an in-
dividual situation. and seek to
guide him tn his planning in the
light of his individual interests
and in combination with the
type of legal education he might
be seeking.’ said Minter

Among the 75 students who
have taken the LSAT. there are
21 Political Science majors, 18
English majors. 16 History
Majors, seven Economics
Majors, and 13 students who are
majoring in some other field

Serving as pre-law advisers
in addition to Minter are

Professor of Education William

Quips And Cranks Debuts
In Fall With Traditional Style

By PAUL WELCH
Staff Writer

The Quips and Cranks is
alive and well, and should
arrive in September, according
to yearbook editor Ron Conoley.

Conoley said that the 1972-73
issue of Quips and Cranks
should be available for on-
campus distribution on or about
the seventh of September, 1973.

The fall publication date for
this year’s annual was decided
upon becuase, as Conoley and

‘next year’s editor Jeff George

both observed. it was felt that
students would get “more for
their money's worth” if spring
1973 activities were included in
this year's *‘book"’

If the vearbook were to be
published in the spring, spring
sports and other events could
not appear in it,
dicated

Graduating semor’s vear
books will be maile d to them at

Conoley in

their last known addresses.

Conoley warned students not
to expect too much in the way of
innovation from this year's an-
nual; budget cuts have
necessitated a return to the
traditional yearbook format, as
contrasted with the unusual
foldertype format used in the
1971-72 book.

“There will be a big attempt
made to involve more students
in the production of the ‘74 year-
book.” said George when asked
about possible changes

Next year’s editor Jeff
George and his business
manager, Bob Stowe. are

already planning the next an-
nual, which should come out in
September, 1974

“We also plan to make more
extensive use of copy and cap-
Hons, and to use color develop
ment of a theme which T can't
tell vou about vet.” he said
