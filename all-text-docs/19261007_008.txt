THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 7, 1926

: Mussolina’s Diet

Italy’s stern dictator has made further rul-
ings for the people he dominates. Acting
nine years behind the times, he has prescribed
dark bread for the-entire nation. The only

use to be made of white wheat flour is in |

macaroni, the national dish. The latest
measure is in accord with the Premier’s pol-
icy of wiping out his country’s war debts by
popular-eeonomy. Perhaps he will add a new
title to the already ponderous list’ he has
assumed since gaining power—Dieticianal
Director of Italy.

The exact identity of the Davidson-P. C.
score of last Saturday and that of four years
ago is especially striking. The late “Popsy”

Hunt brought fame and glory to himself and |

Davidson in 1923 when he booted the pig-
skin through the bars from a difficult angle.
These two defeats will long be remembered
by the Blue Stocking boys.

It is said that the Fili-
pinos wear the tails of
their shirts outside.
The climate is their

excuse. We cannot
recommend the prac-
tice to Americans even
on hot days. Beautiful

Dr. Pressley Speaks to

Students at “Y” Sunday

Chooses Subject of “Life” for
Address at Vespers— Special
Music

The “Y" vespers service last Sunday was

one of unusual interest. The meeting was

| opened with special music by W. L. Hodg-
kin, after which P. J. Garrison ‘led in a
| spirited and profitable song service. J. G.

| Hand and C. F. McRae led in prayer. W.
| S.. Woods read as Scripture reading a portion
lof the 16th chapter of Luke.

Dr. Pressley took as his subject, “Life,
That Greatest of All Experiences and Mys-
|teries.” In following out his subject he
| took as a concrete illustration the story of

|
|

{the beggar Lazarus lying at the gate ot |

| Dives, the rich man.

“Don't think that I’m decrying wealth,”
|he declared, “for,wealth is given of God to
be used for the benefit of suffering humanity.
| Jesus Christ Himself never spoke one word
smacking of socialism, although He did de-
| clare that it was impossible for a rich man
of any other man to be saved if he did not
| trust in God.”

Dives had wealth and position with all their

| appendages which count so much in Oriental |

In speaking of this, Dr. Pressley
lauded America’s sturdy democracy, where

no caste system fastens a yoke upon succes -
sive generations.
| possessing good health besides his material
| advantages, died after a time. His funeral
was a display of much pomp and ceremony in
which wealth was the potent factor. But
his soul, shorn of money's power, passed on
alone to meet the Great Judge, and was con-
demned to torment, a place that Jesus stress-
ed most emphatically.

The poor beggar, Lazarus, lacking every-
thing that the rich man had, was buffeted
about by the world till at length he died. He
was given a pauper’s burial and no one
mourned his passing. “But if this earth
gives you a raw deal, try heaven.” Borne
by angels to Abraham's bosom, he was com-
