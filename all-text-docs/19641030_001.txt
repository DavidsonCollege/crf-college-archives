Massive Student Turnout Gives 28 - Vote Victory To Goldwater

Senator Barry Goldwater car-
tied THE DAVIDSONIAN’S
mock election by 20 votes in a
polling turnout Monday that
surpassed in numbers even last
month’s record high. His margin
was four votes better than in
the previous survey, which had
40 fewer voters.

With 742 students participat-
ing the results showed 381 (51.3
percent) for Goldwater and 353
(47.6 percent) for President
Lyndon B. Johnson. Eight vot-
ers (1.1 percent) were unde-
cided.

Five weeks ago, Goldwater
won 51.0 percent of the votes,
Johnson took 47.6 percent, and
1.4 percent were undecided
among the 702 students voting.

Goldwater's strength in both
elections Jay in the 11 Southern
states — Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiant,
Mississippi, North Carolina
South arolina, Tennessee,
Toxas, and Virginia.

On Monday, 603 students from
the South gave Goldwater a
plurality of 57 votes over John-
son, but non-Southerners hand-
ed Johnson a 29-vote ‘majority,
the total levelling out to Gold-
water's 28-vote victory.

Similarly, 559 Southern stu-
dents last month gave Gold-
water a margin of 36 votes,
which was: shaved down by non-
Southérn voters to a 24-vote
lead. Goldwater's majority a-
mong Southern students a

month ago was 6.4 percent of than

“My name is
I am a student at
college/university. My class
in American Government is
conducting a study of the
presidential and state elec-
tions in North Carolina.”

These are the opening lines
to a general election survey

recently conducted by the
North Carolina Center for Edu-
cation in Politics, a Ford

Foundation project channeled
through UNC. On the David-
son level, Dr. W. P. Minter
volunteered his Political Science
21 class for the leg work in-
volved.

If the project sounds simple
enough, the execution proved
to be trying. While students
found afternoons to be most
convenient to visit their as-
signed voters (selected at ran-
dom from voter registration
in Huntersville and Cornelius),
the voters themselves frequent-
ly did not choose to be home.

the Southern vote; it rose Mon-
day to 9.5 percent.

In the earlier poll, the two
“crossover votes nearly can-
celled each other out. 54 Demo-
crats ‘‘crossed over” to vote
for Goldwater, and 51 Repub-
licans broke party lines in fav-
or of Johnson.

The phenomenon also appear-
ed in the more recent poll, in
which Goldwater won 57 votes
and Johnson won 61.

Both polls also uncovered the
fact that ‘‘backlash’’ (Demo-
crat votes for Goldwater) and
“frontlash’’ (Republican votes
for Johnson) were both promin-
ent in the South, whereas only
“frontlash" was noticeable in
the non-South.

For example, 54 Southern
Democrats went with Goldwat-+
er, 37 Southern Republicans
with Johnson. 24 non-Southern
voters expressed ‘‘frontlash’’ in
their voting, and only three
non-Southern Democrats voted
for Goldwater in the recent poll.
Roughly the same relationships
prevailed in September's ballot-
ing.

The DAVIDSONIAN'S earlier
poll showed that Davidson sen-
iors and juniors favored John-
son. Sophomores and freshmen,
however, showed a strong liking
for Goldwater.

Monday's showing was the
same. Seniors gave Johnson a
19-vote advantage, with 151 of
them voting. 165 juniors gave
the incumbent 13 more votes
Goldwater. The sopho-

I'M TAKING A POLL...”

‘Sir, How Would You Vote?’

The poll revealed numerous
inaccuracies in the registration
lists. Many had moved; some
were no longer living: a few
had not voted in an election
within recent memory. To add

to the student's problems. a
good many people did not de-
sire to be interviewed.

There were several interest-
ing facts revealed by the survey.
A preliminary analysis of the
information recorded indicat-
ed that about half of the local
voters had no knowledge of the
Jonas - James congressional
battle.

Understandably, the national
election drew the most heated
response. Intelligent liberal and
conservative viewpoints were
in the minority, most decisions
being based on emotions, pre-
judices, or custom.

“My people have always
voted Democratic and I'm not
going to change now: I'm vot-
ing for Goldwater.”’ replied one

obviously sheltered local re-
sident. Another noted, ‘‘Nothing
can save this country except
the second coming of Jesus
Chirst,”’ and unfortunatly that
name was missing from the
questionaire.

One eligible voter from among
those questioned objected to
Representative Miller's Cat-
holicism. Several found Hump-
hery to be ‘‘too radical”. Per-
haps surprisingly considering
the target population, many
voters were concerned with
nuclear responsibility.

Dr. Minter noted of the poll
results, ‘We have about 10 per
cent (104) of the registered
voters in Cornelius and about
15 per cent (144) of those re-
gistered in Huntersville: if we
have a truly random sample,
our results should be accurate
with this kind of participation
(considerably higher that the
widely syndicated national
polls.).""

As noted above, the greatest
surprises came at question 32
of the 73-question form. ‘‘Do
you happen to know for sure
if there is race for Congress-
man (member of the U. S.
House of Representatives) in
this district this year.”

The response to this query
drew a complete blank from
about half of those surveyed.
What will be the deciding fac-
tor from this multitude come
next Tuesday? Party tags, fa-
iliarity of a name, or flip of a
coin—but there was no know-
ledge of records or political
beliefs.

In fact one of the few “‘intel-
ligent’’ remarks made about
this campaign came from a
gentleman in Huntersville. ‘I
know Dr. James’ brother and
don't like him, so I'm voting
for Jonas.”

A Jonas supporter. on the

For those who participated.
the poll was both interesting
and frustrating. Personal inter-
views were carried on in groc-
ery stores, before blaring tele-
visions. with obviously disinter-
ested people who had scant
knowledge of anything but
nameless fears, prejudices and
general images.

Some respondents were rude;
some refused to participate

as far away from their rooms
as the fraternity court or the
parking places behind the
gymnasium. The most pro-
bable reason for the lack of
corivenient parking areas _ is
an increased use of automobiles
by Davidson students. Many
students are now using their
cars to ‘‘drive to meals at the
fraternity houses, drive to labs,
and drive to the post office,”
said Foss. ‘The hours between
11 and 11 are the most dif-
ficult ones for parking.”

Foss has offered three solu-
tions to the parking problem:

First. restrict the number of
cars allowed: to students on
Campus by restricting sopho-
mores from having cars or by
allowing ainly those students

Second, to build another park.

park in the lot behind the gym.

“The objections which may
be offered to the first two
solutions by the administration
were that Davidson, being iso-
lated, has a need for cars
to give students the opportunity
to get off, campus during the
weekends; thus. a reduction in
the number of cars is undesir-
able. Secondly, the expense of

ft

building another parking lot is
prohibitive. and a parking lot
is. certainly not beautiful.”
Foss said.

The parking problem is one
which Foss felt could be easily
solved if the administration
were aware that driving habits
of many students are changing
toward more intra campus
trips and if there was an ef-
fort to make responsible peo-
ple on campus aware of the
parking space deficiency.

number of useful parking places

Jackson voiced the possi-
bility) of converting the space
east of Richardson Dorm into
an additional parkinbd lot. Mar-
shall’s committee will examine
these and other solutions and
possibly poll the student body
for suggestions.

Jackson announced that the
upcoming Wildcat Handbook
editor elections would take
place Tuesday after chapel. The
four persons entered in the race
for this position are Danny
Boone, Britt Snider, Rocky Wal-
ker, and Allen Webb. a

The council then continued
its discussion of the drinking
tule, and possible solutions to
the unrealistic situation which
exists at present. The discus-
sion along with the results
of a recent poll of s‘udents
concerning drinking and liquor
on campus was closed to the
press, but Jackson released this
statement, “The Student Coun-
cil discussed the alcohol pro-
blem on campus and considered
possible solutions to the pro-
blem. It will continue its work
in this area.”
