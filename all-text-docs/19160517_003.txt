THE WOODROW
WILSON TREE

About two months ago there came to
Davidson a letter addressed “To Some
Photographer.” It was from an Amer-
ican writer, requesting at once a picture
of the tree which Woodrow Wilson put
out when a student at Davidson. The
letter was given to W. A. Johnson, who
at once started out to locate the tree.

Inquiry was made among the senior
members of the faculty and then the
older residents of the town, but to no
avail, and then letters were sent to all
of Wilson’s class-mates and other men
who were in college at that time, as far
as their addresses could be secured. A
reply was received from nearly all the
men and while they were unanimous in
saying that Wilson planted a tree here,
none of them seemed to know the exact
spot. His class-mates say that the Pres-
ident took a prominent part in the cus-
tamary tree planting in the spring of
1874.
Fx-Governor Glenn, of North Caro-
lina, a classmate of Wilson's, planted
his tree near the church, on the walk
from Chambers, and is of the opinion

N.|that Woodrow Wilson put his tree on

the same walk but twenty or thirty steps
nearer the main building. A photograph
has been taken of this row of elms and
sent to the writer of “Phe Famous ‘Prees
of America,” who has withheld the book
from the press for six weeks, so that the
Wilson tree might. occupy an important
place in this publication.
