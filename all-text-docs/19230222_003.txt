A MERRY DRAMA
In Many Acts and Numberless
Scenes

Introducing “The Freshman,” or to speak
campus wise “Fresh,” a verdant member of
’26, who constantly craves information. It
is our resolution that he shall be informed.

Characters: “Mack” Lennox, a rather
prominent senior; he prides himself on the
nobbiness of his wardrobe; it is his private
opinion that he is a veritable lady-killer.

“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and no less
prominent junior; in matter of dress, his
taste is more conservative and substantial;
in. regard to his love affairs the old adage,
“Still water runs deep,” is applicable.

Act the Fifth

Mac (suddenly)—

Professor Otto Weinstein had achieved un-

dying fame
By the well-known Weinstein theory that
immortalized his name.

His home was filled with medals, he was
swamped with Ph. D.’s.

No Fahrenheit thermometer. could boast of
more degrees.

* Bill (still more sudden)—Whoa! Hold it.
While you are bulling about theories let me
speak a parable.

Mac—Spit it out. . Nothing holding you.

Bill—Listen! That little theory about
| wearing somebody else’s shirts except your
own works fine don’t it? Why don’t you
look up some good styles and invest?

Mac—Since you have such a verdant
knowledge, enlighten me as to the proper in
the shirt line.

Bill—Happened to drop in Mellon’s the
other day and they tell me that the styles. in
shirts this season are fine stripes and checked

| Maderas, the same being what they have a

full line of nothing else but.
Mac—'Tis enough. Me for Mellon’s—

Aiken—Why this egg has a double yolk.
Waiter—Thash strange, gen man over
there saysh hish ash a shicken in it.

Osculation
Doctor (in hygiene class)—Should babies
be kissed? : .
McIver—Not unless they are girl babies
and at least eighteen years of age.

Fresh Air Please
Bug Professor—Mention some of the most
familiar of American birds.
Howell—Sparrows, turkeys, flying squir-
rels and mosquitos.

GOLDEN QUILL SOUGHT
BY MANY REPORTERS

Keen interest is being displayed by mem-
bers of the Reporters Club in the annual
contest for membership in the Order of the
Golden Quill. The golden quill means to the
young journalist what the college monogram
means to the athlete. It signifies that the’
wearer has reached the top in the realms of
local journalism.

To be a wearer.of the quill one must be a
member, or former member, of the Reporters
Club. The selection of members is left to
the discretion of the president of the Re-
porters Club and the managing editor of The
Davidsonian., The candidates are judged for
length of service, quality and qauntity of |
work. A special ruling provides that there
shall never be more, than ten members in
college at any one time.

Quills for this year will be awarded at
junior speaking. |

The members of the order are W. M.}
Heston, L. D. Elkins, E, H»Mauze, H. M. |
Morris, C. F. Wildman, A. C. Wildman,
W. A. Gamble and W. J. Cooper.
