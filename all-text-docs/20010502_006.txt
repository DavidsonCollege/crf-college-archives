You see them in their golf carts, setting up
tables, picking up trash, or cleaning your hall.
You see them at Vail Commons or in the
Union café...or at the laundry...or in the
computer lab. Yet, do ‘you take time to
appreciate these Davidson staff members?

On Monday, April 23, the President’s of-
fice and United Community Action (UCA)
co-sponsored the first annual Staff Apprecia-
tion Day.

A group of UCA students met regularly
throughout the semester to plan an event
designed to show the staff at Davidson how
much students and professors appreciate them.
The students worked to ensure that the day
recognized all staff at Davidson and their
individual contributions to the campus. In
addition, the organizers wanted to make sure
that only students - and not staff - were
responsible for organizing and setting-up the
event.

_ Staff Appreciation Day kicked off at
6:00AM when a small group of students from
UCA and SGA metto distribute Krispy Kreme
donuts to numerous staff members around
campus. In addition to the donuts, staff
members also received commemorative plas-
tic cups sporting the day’s theme.

According to President Bobby Vagt, “The
early morning donuts were a stunner, as most
of the staff understand how students gener-
ally regard ‘early’ activities.”

From 4:00-6:00PM Monday afternoon,
approximately 300 Davidson staff members,
C a / [ 8 92- 5 4 5 4 KO) d, a / their families, and other Davidson professors

ry and students attended a barbecue dinner in

0 honor of the'staff on the front lawn of Cham-
bers. Kim D’Ardenne ‘02 felt that “the day

Another component of Staff Appreciation
Day was a photo gallery on the first floor of
Chambers. The Photo Club designed this
exhibit to highlight the contributions of dif-
ferent staff members to life at Davidson.
Photographs of various staff members and a
story about each person based on interviews
conducted by UCA and Photo Club members
tells students about the personal lives and
campus responsibilities of these staff mem-
bers.

Response to the day has been overwhelm-
ing. Glenda Erwin, Manager of Bookstore
it’s nice to know
that they [students] realize that we do care
about the way we conduct our jobs and do
enjoy dealing with students. I have always
been able to say that Davidson students are
unique and this is more proof of the way
Davidsonians are.”

Director of Auxiliary Services, Richard
Terry, recalled that in his 12 years at Davidson,
there has not been a student initiated staff
recognition program. He commented that the
students’ “attention and sensitivity to the
schedules and needs of our employees, par-
ticularly hourly ones, ensured that the event
would be meaningful.”

Vagt agreed that “the event itself was a
confirmation for the staff that this was not
simply lip-service appreciation, as students
mingled and shared a meal with them. While
I am not certain that it is humanly possible to
express fully our appreciation for all the staff
does, this effort on the part of students was a
wonderful message of thanks.”

Plans for another Staff Appreciation Day
in the Fall are in the works. Contact Jeremy
Campbell or Kim D’Ardenne if you would
like to be a part of this event.
