Wildcat Hall of Fame

DWIGHT MOODY CHAMBERS
D* Basketball

Among the niches in the Wildcat: Hall
of Fame there is one that is carved con-
spiciously. Dwight Chalmers during his
four years at Davidson was among the
most prominent in the campus activities.
His popularity is attested by the numer-
Gus offices that he held.

He played class basketball his first
two years and was captain of his class
team the second year. The third year he
played varsity basketball and the fourth
year was captain of the varsity. Dwight
was a versatile player and the pride of
his fellow schoolmates.

This is a terrible supposi-
tion, but just suppose that
you were to be married to-
However, though he was an outstand-
ing athlete, it was more his interest and
social activity that placed Dwight among
the leaders. A forceful orator and an
interesting speaker he won several de-
bating and oratorical medals. He was
president of the Philanthropic Literary
Society, a member of the Davidsonian
staff, magazine staff, Board of Control
and was assistant baseball manager his
Junior year. During his Senior year he
was rewarded for his diligence by being
selected as president of the class.

this morning, found that
all of your clothing had

been stolen.

You could just walk into
our store and get re-trous-
seaued in a little of no
time---suits, shoes, hats,
shirts, ties, sox, pajamas

Besides his many activities and the
various applications of his time Dwight
proved himself to be an earnest student
and attained the high honor of making
the honor roll his Junior year, and was
taken into that select group of students
that each year win that covetous honor,
O. D. K.

Dwight was an all-round student. He
won ‘no glory on the football field or
baseball diamond but distinguished him-
self by his social and scholastic activity
with the basketball court as his place of
physical endeavor.

preacher arrived you’d be
“all set” for the weddin’.

Of course, you’re not go-

of men’s -things is---and
how quick the service.

The Young Matrons’ club held their |
regular meeting at the home of Mrs. K. |
J. Foreman on. last Friday afternoon |
The program was mainly musical, several |
selections being played on the piano by
Mrs. Elliot. After the meeting, the hus-
bands came as a surprise and helped to
dispose of the tasteful refreshments.
