Power: Perfected in weakness.

Wr knows at dawn what fate
the day will bring: is death
nearby, or will we find life?

In his article last week
entitled “Control and Immortal-
ity,” Robert Ramsay raised the
topic of human power. He
painted vivid images to which I
add my own: Look into the eyes
of a young child and see the way
he looks back into yours. Play
the keys of a diminished chord
and hear the dissonant sounds
rolling off the strings. Kiss your

* friend at the risk of ruining a
friendship, or choose to sacrifice
your will only to discover that
you love him even more. In fact,
our fate does sometimes lie
within our reach.

The power of choice is
enthralling, yet the person who
can master control over the will
is hard to find. As Americans
we take great pride in having
control ‘and revel in our freedom
until we ourselves are captives
under its authority.

Are we free or are we slaves
to the design of human life? The
paradox we face in consideration
of the existence of a sovereign
God is that the ability to reason
and dictate vital moves which
alter the state of our lives
contradicts the excellent and
unreachable supreme authority of
the one who created us with free
wills.

Over time, many people

have tried to disprove the power
of God and replace him with
their own reason. In the intellec-
tual climate of the late 19th
century, scientists were eager to
understand the world and
everything in it. Some thinkers,
using the tools of science to
design a god of their choice,
attempted to become masters of
their own destiny.

Unitarian followers of the
positivist philosopher Auguste
Comte, for example, attempted to
fashion out of their own heads a
world and religion of universal
brotherhood.

In another effort to some-
how control even the very nature
of the divine, a school of

Reductionists reckoned with the
theory that people have created a
God who is really “nothing but”
a crutch upon which to lean in
times of hardship and confusion.
Needless to say, all attempts
to control God or even to
understand God have failed
hopelessly. We know Him only
to the extent that He has revealed
Himself to us. We know of His
just, loving and all-powerful

‘ nature.

In what way, then, is God in
complete control if we are given
free will? Has He, who is
greater than all time and space,
pre-ordained each step we take?
Does He wait patiently, observ-
ing our moves, and then gently

coerce us at His will? At what
point, finally, does His sover-
eignty meet our ability to make ©
decisions?

Make the decision for
yourself. I have no idea how it
works. I know that we have a
God who is intimately involved
with our decisions, in one way or
another. I know that we must
obey God, assuming responsibil-
ity for the decisions we do make.
Perhaps the first step towards
this kind of obedience is taken

-when we admit that we are
incapable of mastering our own
lives and we ask Him to be our
God by giving Him the power
over ours — the power, that is,

that is already His.

Patterson Court is part of our

liberal arts

experience.

After reading Geoff Graham’s

defense of fraternities in The

Davidsonian a few weeks ago, I

thought I would add some points to
_ the argument.

As Geoff pointed out, there is
growing opposition on the part of
the faculty and administration to
Patterson Court. It appears, how-
ever, that what agitates our elders
goes far deeper than the mere ex-
istence of fraternities and eating
houses. Many college officials
routinely criticize the Patterson
Court houses as an anti-intellec-
tual current steering students away
from their desks and into a bottle of
some tasty liquor.

It seems to me, however, that
the problem lies more in the behav-
ior and the party mentality than in
the actual social organizations them-
selves. Toits critics, Patterson Court
exists primarily as an agent of anti-
intellectualism and academic stag-
nation. I assert, however, that fra-
ternities and eating houses are
only a symbol of the lifestyle that

SAT scores, but its well-rounded
and interesting qualities. No one
would want to attend this school if
it were populated entirely by egg-
heads with no social skills. Logi-
cally then, many of the diverse and
personable students that Davidson
desires crave social outlets’ and
places to blow off steam on the
weekends. Last time I checked,

Patterson Court provided a pretty

good source.

Ifany professors feel thatthese
social outlets will detract from aca-
demic ambition or procreate the
dreaded “‘free-ride” mentality, then
they have been misled. Any rea-
sonable human understands that
much of life occurs outside of
books. There is more to a liberal
arts education than just academics.
Davidson did not become such an
impressive place of higher learn-
ing by promoting a one-sided-ap-
proach to education. Social skills
(the type that some learn on
Patterson Court) constitute a cru-
cial part of life and should not be

Let’s face it, no matter how smart
they are, students will want to party

- and sometimes even knock back a

few cold ones (note: “cold ones” is
crazy frat guy slang for cans of
beer). Patterson Court provides a
safe area, monitored by college
officials, for students to drink,
dance, and relax.

drinks and drives,
there are relatively
few injuries, and the
police are always on
hand to break up any

large mentality and
choice of behavior among the stu-
dents. Striking out at these social
organizations only serves as a fu-
tile attempt to alter a behavior that
is far beyond the administration’s
sphere of influence.

A few years ago, when I was a
prospective student, I finally de-
cided to attend Davidson because I
felt this would be a good place for
me to grow in several ways.
Davidson presented an academi-
cally challenging “atmosphere
coupled with a healthy social life.

Compared to equivalent col-
leges and universities, Davidson
was attractive because of the im-
pressive combination of intelli-
gence and personality in the stu-
dents.

What makes Davidson’s stu-
dent body so great is not its high

ignored.

I am not insinuating that
Patterson Court is the only place
on campus that provides healthy
social interaction for students. I
am not even trying to suggest that
Patterson Court is for everyone.
However, the Court does furnish
an atmosphere attractive to a large
group of students.

Since the primary goal of this
institution is the benefit and better-
ment of the students, I would think
the maintenance of such of popu-
lar and important element of cam-
pus life would be crucial to those in
charge.

Practically speaking, the court
provides a safe, regulated environ-
ment for students to let down their
hair and escape the pressures, of
demanding Davidson academics.

trouble. I am not
saying that the college should con-
done drinking or partying, but since
we all know that it will occur any-
way, why not contain it in a shel-
tered environment? It would be
foolish to disband the Patterson
Court organizations and force ac-
tivity into more dangerous, off-
campus locations.

Aboveall, let’s remember that
fraternities have been around a lot
longer than all of us. Somehow,
despite the existence of fraternities
and Patterson Court, Davidson
continues to climb in the world of
national liberal arts colleges. With
all of Davidson’s success and
achievement in recent years, why
sabotage an element of the
Davidson experience that helps
attract students and entertains them
while they are here?

and adults. I will more fully discuss adults in a moment, so let me give

a sentence or four about the church.

I do not detest the church or religion; in fact, I believe it serves a
necessary and important function in some people’s lives. But, at least in
the ultra-oppressive and conservative Presbyterian atmosphere of my
childhood (not my homelife, mind you—I mean my church and the
affiliated school I attended), sex was unmentionable. Save for my AP
English teacher, most instructors in my high school would not have it
brought up in class. “Don’t be seduced by Bathsheeba,” every adult
around me seemed to say, “or Judas’ 12 silver pieces are yours.”

So, why were the adults saying this? Look around you, especially
in the movies. Films like Natural Born Killers, a violence-fest in which
at least 50 people are slaughtered like Thanksgiving turke¥s, receive an
Rrating, while classy love stories like Jason’s Lyric must sacrifice some
artistry to get the same label. The message: Life is cheap, but sex is
trashy.

Benjamin Svetkey’s article “Why Movie Ratings Don’t Work”, in
the November 25 issue of Entertainment Weekly, explores this issue
more fully than I can in this space, but the main jist of the article is that
the rating board is more lenient about violence on screen than any form

“of sex. “You can have as much violence as you want—maim, torture,

kill, whatever,” a studio exec is quoted as saying, “but as soon as you start
to show a breast or some part of the human anatomy, look out!”

In Stephen King’s horror fiction analysis Danse Macabre, King
asserts, “Much of the sex in horror fiction is deeply involved in power
tripping; it’s sex based upon relationships where one partner is largely
under the control of the other; sex which almost inevitably leads to some
bad end.” Although classified, King’s statement can apply to literature
and movies in which sex is as much of an evil character as the characters
themselves.

Take Basic Instinct, for example. Sharon Stone’s character is
completely uninhibited in regards to her sex drive, and pursues satisfac-
tion with fervent energy. Therefore, she is nlt ar alb and evil. The
two sides go hand in hand.

Is it any wonder, then, that with so much negative publicity, sex has
a tainted image?

Ican provide no solution to this dilemma, except to wonder whether
itis a dilemma at all. How exhilarating it must be, after years of hearing

that sex is degenerate, to discover that the opposite is true?
