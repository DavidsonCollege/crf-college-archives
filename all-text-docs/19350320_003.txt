Vesper Speaker Discusses
Religious Ideas Of Students

John Howard, Columbia Sem-
inary Student, Speaks At
Vesper Services

Last Sunday’s vesper service was pre-
sented by a deputation “composed of John
Howard, speaker, and a quartet made
up of James Bradley, bass; John Tal-
madge, baritone; Bob Dupree, second
tenor, and John Cotts, first tenor, from
Columbia Seminary, Decatur, Ga.

After a hymn, and a prayer by Sid
March, the vocal quartet presented two
numbers, “Take Time To Be Holy” and
“The Riches of Love in Christ Jesus.”

Mr. John Howard, an alumnus of Da-
vidson College, began his talk by recon-
structing a picture of the campus relig-
ious attitude in his day. In connection

with the attitude of the students, the|

speaker centered his attention on the al-
ways-prevalent “bull sessions.”

“I have found that, sooner or later,
the topic of discussion leads to two main
subjects—women and religion—subjects
of which we are most ignorant, The
usual ‘bull session,’ as far as the sub-
ject of religion goes, starts by a tar-and-
feathering of the fast ‘Y’ speaker, an
attack on compulsory church, or a dis-
cussion of hypocritical church members,
creeds, preachers, or comparative relig-
ion. Always after such discussions a
skepticism rankles in the heart of the
student and he feels that everything con-
cerning religion is out of date. The liv-
ing Christ is always in our midst, dar-
ing us to challenge-Him. Our modern
learning does not compare with His great
eternal truths. For a true education, we
should learn to know Jesus.

“Would you want Jesus on the cam-
pus with you? Would you want Him
with you in your dormitory life, at your
‘bull sessions,’ in your fraternity, and
in all your activities? No, I’m afraid
He would seem-out of date. But the
truth is, He is so far ahead of us that
He is out of date. After all, our opin-
ion of Christ is the real estimate of our
attitude toward the Christian religion.
Every day, in some of our deeds, we
crucify Christ, although in a way dif-
fering from that in Bible times.”

Mr. Howard then continued with a
personal reference:

“When I was on this campus I had
a similar attitude, to some extent. I
hated the name of preacher, and I had
no idea of ever being one, although I
did try to live for Jesus Christ, Never-
theless, I did become a preacher, There
may be some who poke fun at preach-
ing, but we need to bow to Jesus Christ
only. He invites you,
middle ground.”

After a number, “Shall I Crucify My
Saviour?” by the quartet, Dr. C. M.
Richards dismissed the
the benediction.

Other members of the Columbia Sem-
inary delegation were Dr. P. H. Car-
michael, professor of Bible and Relig-
ious Education, who spoke at the morn-
ing and evening church services, and J.
K. Parker, who ‘addressed the Student
Volunteer Group.

Williams Resigns

From NRA Board

Noted Davidson Alumnus Fin-
ishes Work As Government
Administrator

A short while ago the President of
these United States sat down in his
office to dictate a letter, Laying aside
all the formality which business of state
usually demands, he opened the letter
with the familiar greeting: “My Dear
Clay.”

The subject of the letter was the final
dismissal of S. Clay Williams from one
of the highest-and most influential posts
under what is called the new adminis-
tration, the post of Administrator of the
National Recovery Administration. It
expressed the sincere regret of the Pres-
ident at the loss of an able subordinate
and his gratitude for the service ren-
dered to the country.

And so S. Clay Williams returns to
his native state, North Carolina, to take
up his own private business where! he
left off last fall.

Davidson College has a special inter-
est in the career of Clay Williams be-
cause he was born in Mooresville and
spent four years of his preparation for
life on this campus. When he gradu-
ated-in 1905 he had gained the rare dis-
tinction of becoming a member of both
Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Delta
Kappa. That alone is adequate evidence
of a well-rounded perjod of college ac-
tivity.

He continued his studies at the law
school of the University of Virginia
and soon launched a successful law
career . Eventually he became an exec-
utive of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco
Company.

After General Hugh S. Johnson had
firmly established the NRA as a_ basic
part of this country’s business set-up,
he retired, leaving the NRA more or
less in its original form. President
Roosevelt wanted the NRA to become
a permanent part of the government, and
he needed a shrewd business man, fa-
miliar with all business trends and prob-
lems, to take charge of it, mold it into
its permanent form, out its
wrinkles,

For this purpose he chose Clay Wil-
liams for the moméntous task of con-
structing what may turn out to be a
new department of the national govern-
ment. Mr. Williams . accepted on the
condition that he might be allowed to
return to his business as soon as, his
immediate task was accomplished.

For the past several months he has
sacrificed his own interests to work for

he feels that now he has accomplished
all that he can. The time has come for
a permanent administrator to take over
the NRA and devote his entire interests
to its management. Therefore Mr. Wil-
liams leaves a job well done and sends
his resignation to the President, who ac-
cepts it regretfully, expressing his per-
sonal respect in the familiar salutation,
“My Dear Clay.”

Writes Article Concerning
Founder’s Day

The fourth issue of the Alumni Jour-
nal will be off the press by the end of
this week and will be immediately dis-
tributed to the alumni of the college.

This issue will have a cover design
similar to the last publication; it is a
three-color arrangement with a picture
of the college well.

A smaller issue will come from the
press this month, having been cut down
to about twenty pages. The alumni office
expects to send out about five thousand
copies.

Grier Martin has written the leading
article for this issue. It is a story of
Founder's Day, which will be celebrated
on the Davidson campus on April 9, with
a feature address by the Hon; Cameron
Morrison, former of North
interest to
the students as well as alumni will be

governor
Carolina. Other articles of
on plans for commencement in June, ar-
ticles on the student body, faculty, and
a few personal articles on the alumni.

This issue will be the first of Volume
II. It is the fourth publication of the
Alumni Journal; the next will be out
in May. The Alumni Committee, when
they began the publication of the Jour-
nal, agreed to issue five installments of
the Journal, and then decide whether it
will continue or not.
