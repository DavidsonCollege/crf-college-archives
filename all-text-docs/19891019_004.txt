“Scales”

By JOHN EARLES

Things with scales have been
entering Chambers Building--
but not the kind of scales used
by the science departments.
Over the past few weeks, sev-
eral snakes have found their
way into Chambers, only to
discover that the only way out
is ina Hefty bag.

The first snake was found by
custodian Gordie Eddy in the
south basement. After recog-
nizing the creature as a copper-
head, Eddy beat the animal
until it died.

Despite Eddy’s speedy dis-
covery and removal of the
snake, workers in the mailing
room and language lab have
remained concerned. Sharon
Broome, Central Services assis-
tant, expressed the gencral
sentiment when she admitted,
“There just wasn’t room
enough for meand the snakes.”

For science majors taking the
MCAT’s, the presence of a
snake in the Gallery served asa
welcome tension breaker. The
reptile was discovered during
one of several ten-minute test
breaks and quickly became the
center of attention.

“The snake appeared tobea
copperhead,” said senior Lara

in Chambers slither off-balance

Glenn, “and was in a position
as if he were going to strike.”

For several minutes, the
snake remained relatively mo-
tionless and allowed itsclf to be
observed bya groupofamused
science majors as others called
for campus security

Upon the arrival of Public
Safety Director Jackie Hughes,
the snake remained passive. In
the time that elapsed before his
end, the snake seemed to ac-
cept his fate in the realization
that he would be no match for
the sole of Hughes’ boot. With
some tensions released, the
students were finally able to

_ return to their testing.

Only three days later, a small
snake was discovered in the
third floor classroom of Presi-
dent ‘John Kuykendall. The
snake was noticed in a desk
near the back of the room at the
beginning of class.

On examination, Junior
Mark Wainright deduced that
the snake was non-poisonous
and could be removed easily.

“I put my notebook in front
of it to distractit,” he said, “and
then grabbed it by the back of
the head.”

Students briefly debated
whether the snake should be

dropped out the window or
taken downstairs and released.
For the snake, the final decision
was unfavorable. On Kuyken-
dall’s request to aim for the
bushes, the snake was tossed

out the window.

One explanation for the
snakes' appearance can be due
toconstruction of the Baker
Sports Complex. This con-
struction has likely displaced

many snakes which now seek
shelter from the increasingly
cold nights. As recent events
demonstrate, however, Cham-
bers building is not a place
where they will feel welcome.

This snake thought that it could escape notice in one of Chambers' classrooms, but the studious reptile
was not so lucky. The trespasser met its end rather quickly, as did other visiting snakes two weeks ago.

“1 always tell my parents I’m doing well in my —
classes,” and other lies we tell our parents

By LIZ DAVIDSON

Whenever Rachel Epps’s parents call
her ona Friday or Saturday night, they
are greeted with their daughter’s
friendly recording: “Hi, Momand Dad.
I’m at the library now.”

Actually, Rachel is probably study-
ing. However, she is more than likely
not studying anything academic. Still,
her parents are comforted by the mes-
sage, leaving me to wonderwhat other
lies do we tell our parents?

The most universal lie is in response
to the question “What are you doing?”
And the answer? "I'm studying.”

Often, there is the sound of beer cans
opening, loud music and drunken
laughter in the background. Still, the lie
is pulled off with relative ease. After all,
most of us got here because we studied.
It isn’t an entirely new concept to our
parents.

“I always tell my parents I’m doing
well in my classes,” said Barclay Cun-

ningham. “That follows pretty natu-
rally after the initial ‘I’m studying.’
Then the lies get more specific from
there. Like, ‘I don’t let boys into my
room,’ and ‘The partieshere are fun, but
no one drinks, especially not me.”

The girls on First Rich have the lies
down to a simple system.

“When your roommate's parents call
and your roommate isn’t there, you tell
them she’s at the library,” Mandy
Aycock stated, recalling a time when

her parents called and were overjoyec
tohear that she was “studying.”

Lies also vary depending on parents
Phrases such as “I’m getting enougt
sleep,” and “I eat breakfast every day’
slip out with ease, along with my
favorites” My room’s not a mess,” anc
“My life is organized.”

Italldepends upon what they want tc
hear. Weare artists before we are schol
ars, creating a fantasy world of ow
parents’ dreams.

Thoughts of May bring senior panic

By LUISE WEINRICH

I got theidea for this article from three
of my friends. We have been discussing
our fears and hopes for the future, and
all of us admit to having little or no idea
of whatis ahead of us. Where will we be
on May 14? How will wesurvive? What

about graduate school? (All this pres-
sure on top of the normal Davidson
stress!).

We stayed up talking about it very
late for several nights, and then my
friends came up with a plan. They de-
cided to try out some of the careers and
lifestyles they are considering to see
how it feels to be a lawyer or a musician
or an art teacher.

They did this in an efficient, simple
and inexpensive way: they wrote the
name of theirconsidered occupationon
a sheet of paper and posted it over their
beds. Every morning they looked at the
paper, and imagined that they were
what the sheet said.

They dressed as a lawyer would

dress, or walked as a musician might
walk, or spoke as a professor might
speak. This approach did scem to give
them some insight into their potential
professions.

The “lawyer” couldn’t stand to think
of having to behave as a lawyer would
have to behave in order to assure her
clients of her competence in court. She
felt that she couldn’t speak or move as
spontaneously as she would like, and
she hated the thought of wearing con-
servative clothing and dark shoes most
of the time.

Maybe this is a stereotypical view of
what a lawyer is like, but there is a
kernel of truth in it. At the least my
friend learned that a certain orientation
towards others is unnatural or uncom-
fortable for her,and she began to realize
thatsome titles that sound good are just
not a good match for her personality.

My other friends got something dif-
ferent from the experiment. This ap-
proach helped one student to stop

worrying and to feel as if she was mak-
ing progress toward finding a career
direction.

For theanotherstudent, the would-be
art teacher, this exploration squelched
her desire to teach: “I looked at how I
wrote ‘art teacher’ on the paper, and I
realized that I could never teach art,
because I can’t draw!”

This method is just one of many ways
that seniors are dealing with stress
about the future. I have felt the pressure
in my own life,and I wascurious to find
out if others thought about itas muchas
Ido.

I talked to about 15 seniors, most of
whom I didn’tknow before writing this
article. Here is what they said:

“I think about it [the future] every-
day. Planning for the futureis definitely
blocking my ability to enjoy my senior
year. I think some people are serious
[about planning] and some haven't
thought about it.”

“It’s terrible! It’s rotten that I think ~
about itevery day.”

“I got too stressed out about making
decisions, so I decided not to make any
more.”

“I think almost everyone is fright-
ened, even if they are not admitting it,
even to themselves. A big part of itis the
change in the relationship with parents.
We don’t want to admit it, because
we've been tring to get away from them
since adolescence, butitis hard to break
away.”

“I’m really excited about what's
gonna happen, because I don’t know
what's gonna happen. It’s like being
dropped off at camp for the first time; _
you will feel empty for a while even if
there is a lot of fun stuff to do.”

“I'm thinking about itall the time, but
most of the time I’m just thinking that I
don’t need to think about it so much.” ”
