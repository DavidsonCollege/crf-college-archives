50 Companies Handle
Placement Interviews

January 30 marked the beginning of the annual Davidson
Placement interviews which are presently scheduled to last

through March.

All together, over 50 companies
will send their representatives for
interviews with more’ than 72
Seniors.

For the past four years the
placements have been handled by
the staff of the Student Union
snd have become an interesting
and important part of the David-
son curriculum. Many members of
the Student Body who have no
clear idea of what the business
world is like or what opportunities
are open to them in various fields
can find counsel and advice in a
most pleasant atmosphere.

Outstanding companies such as
Scott Paper Company, Carnation
Company, 1.B.M.. Republic Steel,
Westinghouse, ESSO, DuPont, Gen-
eral Electric Company, and others
provide capable interviewers for
instructing the students in the
needs and the general structure
of the respective firms.

Opportunities that are at present
open to graduates may vary from
truck driving jobs to occupations
preparatory to executive positions.
The salaries normally vary from
$350 to $450 a month.

Although the companies are in-
terested primarily in their own
needs, their interviewers show a
great deal of sympathy toward the
individual student’s own problems
and desires.

Primary emphasis is not placed

Applications Exceed
Las! Year's Tofal

Applications for entrance in the
freshman class next fall received
so far are considerably more than
at this time Jast year, according to
F. W. Hengeveld, Registrar.

Over 500 applications for ad-
mittance have been received to
date. If the trend continues the
total number of applications will
be approximately 750, surpassing
last year’s sum of 700.

Because the scores of most of
the applicants on the College
Board Entrance Examinations have
not yet been received, only fifty
students have been definitely ad-
mitted. Since the grading process
is slow, the final results will not
be in the Registrar’s Office until
February 5, or shortly thereafter.

The committee on admission,
plans to meet regularly during the
last three weeks of this month and
the early part of March. The ma-
jority of the class of 1961 will be
chosen by the first week in March.
The committee plans to admit ap-
proximately 260 freshmen and
transfers next year, an increase
of twenty over this year’s 240.
Total enrollment for next year
will be between 860 and 870 stu-
dents.

FOURTH HERD FEATURED

By WILLIE THOMPSON

With the repercussions from the
semester examinations momentari-
ly forgotten, the attention of the
Davidson College student body has
rapidly focused on the music of
Woody Herman and the approach-
ing Mid-winters dance weekend
of February 15-16.

The highlight of the Davidson
winter social. activities will feature
both a formal and- an informal
dance interspersed with a presen-
tation by the Red and Black Mas-
quers, a band concert, several fra-
ternity parties, and in all prob-
ability, the usual rain.

The first official part of the

weekend’s activities will be the {

presentation of “Gramercy Ghost”,
a two-act comedy, in Chambers
Auditorium at 7:30 p.m., on Thurs-
day and Friday nights. Individual
tickets and date tickets may be
purchased for 75 cents and 50
cents respectively. These will fe
on sale at the door.

Bunny Perkinson. president of
the Interfraternity Council, has an-
nounced that Friday night's for-
mal dance will start a half an
our later than usual, due to the
play. The Friday dance will. last
from 9:30 p.m., until 1:00 a.m. The
theme of the weekend’s dances

Administration Founds
Jervey Language Lab

The administration of Davidson College has authorized
the establishment of a Language Laboratory, to be installed
and in operation before the beginning of the fall semester.

At present it is planned that be-
ginning students in sections 11-12
and 21-22 of all language courses
will be required to make use of
this laboratory under the direction
of their professors. Final details
as to the operation of the labora-
tory have not been decided upon
at the present time.

A faculty committee has been
named to draw up the plans and
supervise the installation of this
laboratory which will allow  stu-
dents to practice their listening
and speaking ability as an in-
tegral part of their language
courses. Dr. George B. Watts is
chairman of the committee which
consists also of Dr. Pedro Trakas
and Dr. Howard French. The mem-
bers of the committee have al-
ready visited laboratories in other
institutions and plan to examine
others before deciding on the
equipment and arrangement of the

“Inew laboratory.

At a recent meeting of this com-
mittee, at which Dean Pietenpol
and Treasurer Grier Martin were
present, the announcement was

. made that the Quadwranglers Club

Room on the third floor of Cham-
bers Building was being consid-
ered to house the new workshop.
It is hoped that some twenty lis-
tening booths, all equipped with ear
phones, and the majority with re-
cording machines, will be installed.

“JINKS JERVEY”

It is expected that the language
laboratory will bear the name
“James W. Jervey ITl Memorial
Language Laboratory.” “Jinks”
Jervey of Greenville, S. C., was an
honor graduate of Davidson Col-
lege in the class of 1953, with a
major in Spanish. In 1955 he re-
ceived the degree of Master of
Arts at the University of Wiscon-
sin, He died in 1956 while continu-
ing his studies in Chile on a
Rotary Scholarship. The family and
friends of “Jinks” Jervey are con-
tributing the funds for the equip-
ment and installation of the new
utility.

A search by the Curriculum
Committee for a system of degree
requirements acceptatle to the
Faculty continues this week. In
attempting to break the snag which
resulted in a tie vote over the AB
and BS Degree question, the Cur-
riculum Committee has been meet-
ing weekly to discuss various
plans.

The degree question is sched-
uled to be reopened at either the
March or February faculty meet-
ing. It was the opinion of Dean C.
J. Pietenpol that whether action
would be taken in February or
March depended largely on the
success of the Curriculum Com.
mittee in finding a suitable pro-
posal.

It is the opinion of several mem-
bers of the faculty that the gen-
eral thinking of the faculty is
slowly moving toward willingness
to vote for a change in degree re-
quirements.

Twenty-One Students

Leave First

Semester

Twenty-one students have left school after the first
semester. From the list released by Dean Spencer this week,

it is evident that the number

of withdrawals this year is a

marked decrease over the twenty-seven withdrawals of last

year’s first semester.

Of the twenty-one withdrawals.
thirteen were sophomores and six
were freshmen. This is approxi-
mately the same ratio as that of
1956 when fourteen of the with-
drawals were sophomores and five
were freshmen, The big difference
lies in the fact that no juniors

| have. left. In 1956 at the end of

the first semester, six had with.
drawn.

Another difference with respect

to last year's first semester is the |

fact that there were only five
involuntary withdrawals this year
and eleven last year.

Dean Spencer was very pleased
with the overall picture plus the
fact that we have nine new stu-

dents who have transferred to Da-|'

vidson. It is his opinion that in

the future the number of with-
drawals will be even less.
