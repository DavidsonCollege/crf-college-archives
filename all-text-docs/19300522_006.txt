Doctor MacConnell

Returns to Campus

Physician Returns to College After
an Eleven Weeks’ Absence

Dr. John W. MacConnell, secretary of the
State Board of Medical Examiners, and phy-
sician for Davidson College students, has re-
turned to Davidson after an eleven weeks’
stay at the diagnostic hospital for United
States veterans in Washington, D. C. Dr.
MacConnell spent several weeks in Wash-
ington for observation purposes, and later
returned for a major operation, which was
necessary because of injuries received dur-
ing the World war. Although Dr. MacCon-
nell is able to walk around and greet his
friends, it will be several weeks before he
will regain his normal strength and can
again assume his regular duties.

Davidson Five and Ten
Years Ago

‘ Five Years Ago
With this, the last issue of the year for
The ‘Davidsonian, the end of. ten years of
faithful service comes as a milestone along
the road to success. The paper was founded
by the Class of 1915 and it has lived up
to its reputation of being the “livest wire on
the hill.”
The Student Council and student body
officers for 1925-26 were installed at a spe-
cial meeting of the student body held after
chapel, Friday morning.
The Senior Class has put forth every ef-
fort to make the 89th commencement of Da-
vidson College one which will stand out in
the minds of those present for years to come.
Harry Price and Lathran McCutchen, rep-
resenting Davidson in the state tennis tourna-
ment last week, won the inter-collegiate
championship in doubles.

Ten Years Ago
The classes of ’15, ’10, and ’05 are plan-
ning reunions. The trustees, of course, will
be here for their meeting. Plans are under
way to have the R. O. T. C. band furnish
music for the occasion. Commencement this
year will be a gala affair indeed, and will
be worth the presence of the whole student
body.

The. General Assembly, which meets in
Charlotte, May 20, has been invited to visit
Davidson on May 22. This will be the first
time that Davidson has had the honor of
entertaining the General Assembly in about
twenty-five years. :

The commencement invitations are out.
They are being distributed by five men
chosen from the Senior Class.

party during rushing season, so any fra-
ternity wishing to have one will have to do
so on the date above, which was agreed on
by the Pan-Hellenic Council.

The customary reception for the’ incoming
Freshmen during this period will be on a
date to be set by the Y. M. C. A. some time
‘}in the near future.

Books We Have Read

“Escape’—By Francesco Fausto Nitti.
Preface by his uncle Fi. Severio Nitti, for-
mer Premier of Italy. 267 pages. Publishers,
G. P. Putman’s Sais. Price $2.50. (1930)

Francesco Nitti tells the story of his de-
tention on Italy’s “Devils’ Island.”

This volume of tragic adventure has the
distinction of being suppressed in Italy. Re-
cently we read that the manager of Italy's
largest chain of book stores has been ar-
rested for selling this book after having
smuggled a large number into the ‘country
from England.

The author of “Escape’ seems to be a
writer of considerable literary ability, even
of some talent. The first chapter is quite a
marvel of rhetorical suspense, a word pic-
ture of the escape from the Island of Lipare,
in which, not a name is mentioned. The
story begins:

“A man crept stealthily along the narrow
jitty that ran out into the sea on the darkest
side of the harbor. Along the waterfront,
only a few hundred yards distant, blazed the
lights of taverns where fishermen were drink-
ing noisily. At the foot of the narrow, wind-
ing street leading up into the town, groups
of soldiers were lounging and playing cards,
their rifles between their knees. The lights
from the houses revealed the black outlines
of warships lying in the harbor. But the
jitty along which the man was crawling lay
deep in the shadow of the steep, volcanic
rocks, crowned by a huge, old castle that
overhung the town.”

The man is, of course, young Nitti. He
drops quietly into the dark waters and swim-
ming softly finally arrives at the appointed
rock. After some suspense the motor boat
which is to carry the refugees to safety ap-
pears, but his companions are nowhere to be
seen. After much anxiety and at the last
moment the two other fugitives arrive and
with motors wide open the launch roars
away in the darkness.

In more detail we are shown the events
leading up to the arrest’of young Nitti, his

on the prison island.

The dramatic escape was prepared by
young Italians, who, to free their compan-
ions, face every danger. The elder Nitti
states, in the preface, that their names can-
not be given, because to do so would ex-
pose them, and, much worse, their families,
to the most unreasonable and atrocious per-
secution.

Shortly after the war, Benito Mussolini
became leader and finally absolute ruler in
Italy, At the time, his country was in a piti-
ful condition. The people were bordering on
starvation. The financial foundations of the
nation were tottering and banks all over
the country were closed because of unhappy
failures. The people had wanted freedom;
they were getting it. Absolute liberty pro-
duced a turmoil bordering upon revolution.
Various criminal groups such as the “mafia”
were ganging on the unhappy citizens. What
was to be done? The new leader stretched
out his “mailed fist” and suddenly the out-
rage ceased, Something had to be done, says
Mussolini, to raise this country, the laugh-
ing stock of the Peace Conference, to the
level of other great nations. Many Italians
opposed these drastic actions. Many revolted.
Among this number was the Nitti family.
However, we are assured by the former pre-
mier (in the preface) that the three fugi-
tives are not revolutionists. The nephew,
Francesco Nitti, informs us, pages 19 to 23,
that he and his family are nothing else, and
glories in the fact.

Taken at its face value, it is a rattling
good story of adventure, comparable in some
way, with Casanovas’ miraculous escape
from the “Leads” of Venice, for from the be-
ginning to the end, young Nitti leads a dar-
ing and adventuresome life.

It seems unfortunate that so much oppo-
sition should arise to the publishing of this
book. Such action will prejudice opinion
against Fascism from the outset. It will be
assumed that the Fascists have something
to hide. The sane procedure would ‘have
been to encourage the publication of the book,
and then try to answer the charges by log-

ical refutation.

will have some good material to back him
up next year in Gene Dubose, Fain, McLain,
and a few freshmen coming up, but the ab-
sence of Johnston and Halverstadt will cause
a lot of worry. Both Poe and Dubose, how-
ever, are flashy players and this dirpinutive
couple should go far in the state next year
with Fain stepping along with them. J. L.

both members of Beta Theta Pi soci® fra-
