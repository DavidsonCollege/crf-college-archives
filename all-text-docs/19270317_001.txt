Charlotte Business Man Speaks to
Students Concerning Ethics and
Personality in Business

“All the honors attained in scholastic
work, on the athletic field, and even your
college diploma will not assure you of a
place in the business world,’ emphatically
declared Mr. Tom Glasgow, business man
of Charlotte, in speaking to a large and in-
terested group Davidson College
dents in closing the five-week vocational
guidance institute here this week. ‘“Busi-
ness men do not care what you have done

you have won, but are more concerned with
what you can do. Furthermore, they care
not what you are, nor who you are.”

He talked to the students in terms of the
business world. He cautioned against the
belief that when a student completed col-
lege he could enter big business. He ad-
monished them to consider the high school
graduates who are already in business, for
they have obtained a four-year start. “They
can not be ‘high-hatted’ or laughed at, since
they are real competitors.”

This prominent business man stressed the
power of personality and maintained that
it was of greater importance than mental
ability and social accomplishments. Next
in importance to personality was the right
attitude toward the “boss”, who is not easily
fooled, for, else the business will go into
bankruptcy. “Business is largely buying and
selling, the difference between the buying
and selling price being the profit. The em-
ployer buys your services and if you sell them
in a greater proportion than he paid for
them, you will have a bigger chance to suc-
ceed.”

“Save money,’ advised Mr. Glasgow.
“Many opportunities will come to you in
business for investment, and those caf not

Pinkney, Christian and Lincoln, as stu-

with humor, following which Frew, Long,
DeArmond, Reynolds, Christian, and
Matthews spoke on behalf of the class.
Jim Appleby, “Y” Secretary, and Ernest
Milton, Alumni Secretary, also took the
floor for a few moments.

Following these talks Mr. Kuester
spoke urging the members of the class
to take advantage of the opportunities
which were theirs as Freshmen.

Mr. David Ovens, manager of Ivey’s de-
partment store, was the chief speaker of
the evening. In a humorous but decisive
manner he showed that Davidson was
probably not the best college in the world
but that it was among the best. and that
the class must uphold the standard set
by their predecessors.

Spike has been selected by
the coming school year, 1927-1928, winning
over Julian Lake for this position. During
the past year each of these men had done
a great deal of creditable work as junior
assistant to Bill Story, varsity cheer leader
for this year,

This is a very. responsible position and
entails a large amount of work on the part
of the holder, such as) providing a place
for the student body when games are played

outside Davidson; getting students a lower

above all keeping the spirit of the whole
student body up to the highest pitch.

Junior class will be elected by the student
body for the purpose of assisting the senior
leader in the cheering, and incidentally to
work up to the senior position next year.
Any member of the Junior class is eligible

to go out for this office. The assistants for
next year have not been elected but this
will be done at an early date.
