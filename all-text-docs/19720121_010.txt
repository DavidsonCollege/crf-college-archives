Noting a sudden, increase in
the number of pets in the dor-
mitories, Direc or of Student
Tlousing Seotty Nicholls issued a
letteer of watning Jan. 11 to
Students that no pets are al-
lowed in the residence hails.

“Recently we have had an in-
crease ot animals, particularly
untrained animals, in the dor-
mitories,” Mrs. Nicholls said.
In wo effort to enloree the
standart! rule of no pets, she
issued the following Statement:
‘Any dog or cat found aay
where in a residence hall will be
impounded by the college and
removed to the Mooresville Vet-
erinary Clinic where a student
may claim his pet after paying
é€xpenses.”

However,. Mrs. Nicholls said,
“Generally speaking. students
are very responsive to requests
to get rid of their pets.”

Another animal problem is
the number of stray dogs and
cats which roam the campus.
These animals are attracted to
the studcnts, because they are
nice to the animals. As a result,
the dog or cat will often follow
students into the dorm, and the
outcome is somestimes quite
messy.

There are several reasons for
the rule of no pets. The prin-
cipal one is that the allowance
of pets in a facility such as a
dormitory is against the rules
of the board of health.

Other reasons are that pels
damage propetty, cathe custodi-
wus ecrXIra work, and ure nuis-
ances to other students not
quite so fond of animals,

On the other hand. some stu-
dents argue that they have ia
right to keep pets, Coming [roi
homes where they have had
pets. these students feel that
they should be allowed tu keep
their animals on campus, espe-
cially if it does not bother any
coe else,

But. Mrs, Nicholls contend...
“IH vou love your pet you will
See that it has a good home else-
where.”

Sharing is the
great and
imperative need
of our time.

An unshared life
is not living.

White Discusses Reactions
To Davidson With Freshmen

By TOM AINSWORTH
Staff Writer

It. Fdmunds White, Director
of Adiminissions recently met in
formally with members of first
floor Sentelle in order to find
oul firsthand what their reac
tion do Davidson was and how
it had changed during the past
months.

“T had heard it said that a
great many members of the
Freshman class were question-
ing whether or not Davidson
nad been their right choice."
he said.

White claimed that the story
of the numbers of — students
transferring was ‘grossly ex-
uggerated.”’ It seems that of
the nine who left, only three
did so for reasons of dissatis
faction with the college.

However, the main reason for
the complaints brought out at
the meeting was over coeduca
tion and the Davidson social
Lystem,

As to what the eollege can
answer in regard to this. White
thinks it's “crucial to see what
the trustees decide in the Spring.
‘there inay be many inore girls
on campus. If not. then its up
tu cach student to evaluate what
Davicson offers as a man’s col
lege as apposed to a realistic
evaluation of whal a coeduca:-
Sienal iastitudion weuld iiive to
afer’

“If another college offers
semmeliing better, then he should
transter, and we will help him.
Het he should realize that the

school he chocses is not going
tu have exactly what he wants.”’

Resides the social system and
eating clubs, the other problems
presented included registration
for ciasses, grades and credits.
and generally individual pro
blems which White feels could
have been and frequently were
answered by the oher members
of the group.

So far, first floor Sentelle has
heen the only hall visited, and
as for others in the future,
White has sid that he “‘hasn’t
really decided yet.”

Mike Creasman. first Sentelle

hall counselor, thinks that the
discussion was good in the
sense of cispetling rumors of
transfels and decreasing appli-
cations.

In regard to the freshmen in-
volved in the discussion, reac-
tions were mixed, but for the
most part favorable.

To both Skip Burton and Chip
Jones, the session seemed to
be moving in the right direction
lo help solving some of the pro-
bieins, but that White *‘mainly
talked about things not in his
department.”
