Branching out: dining options in Charlotte.

By Rachel Newcomb

So you want to go out to din-
ner but you’re bored with the fare
in Cornelius. You’re tired of the
fried cheese/soup/club sandwich
comboat the local restaurant where
all the waiters and waitresses look
like aerobics instructors. And
you’ve had one too many greasy
burritos at the Mexican cafeteria.
Maybe you have a date and you
want to impress him or her by
trying something new. Picture
yourself driving down I-77 toward
Charlotte saying casually to Pat, “I
know of this great little place ...”

Well, here are some sugges-
tions. As a lifelong resident of this
area, I’ve found a number of di-
verse Charlotte restaurants that I
love to return to. Hopefully you’ ll
love them, too. (I’ve rated them
according to cost as well.)

First on my list is Wolfman’s
Pizza. It’s a small, hip little place |
located next to the Fresh Market
on Selwyn Avenue. Wolfman’s

far surpasses any pizza restaurant
in the Charlotte area with its dis-
tinct California pizzas. My par-
ents and I have been coming here
for a few years now, and all my
roommates are converts. What
makes Wolfman’s Pizza good is
the uniqueness of their menu, as
well as fresh ingredients and skill-
fully prepared pies. Try the New
Mexico Pizza, a delightful combi-
nation of chicken, black bean salsa,

‘red onions, fresh tomato, and two

cheeses. All pizzas can be made
without meat for vegetarians. And
if you want to create your own,
they have virtually every ingredi-
ent known to man, such as fresh
garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, arti-
chokes, or seafood. Salads are
excellent, especially the Greek
salad. For dessert, I recommend
the tiramisu, which is light, airy,
and sweet. Cost is moderate. Ten
dollars or less if you take a friend
and split a salad, pizza, and des-
sert.

ON

A little more on the expensive
side, the Melting Pot is the kind of
place you’ll dream about for
months after you eat there. It’s a
fondue restaurant where all the food
is prepared at your table by you. If
you try the combination platter for
two, you get a little bit of every-
thing, with salad, appetizer, meal,
and dessert. For the appetizer, the
waiter will turn on the stove in the
middle of your table and place a
pan on top, filling it with a small
quantity of beer (this helps the
flavor and consistence of the
cheese). When this gets hot, grated
cheese and spices are melted, and
you’re given a variety of different
breads and veggies to dip into the
mixture. For the main course, you
can choose from either a peanut oil
or boullion-based fondue. A tray
of vegetables and meats is ready
for you to cook yourself, suspended
on long shish kebabs.

Forcondiments there are about
five different kind of sauces. And

MERRY CHRISTMAS! GOOD LUCK ON EXAMS!

2 GREAT LOCATIONS TO SERVE YOUR CHRISTMAS NEEDS

NORMAN CROSSINGS AT LIVERPOOL

All your Christmas needs...

the dessert — rich chocolate fon-
due with food to dip into it —
pound cake, cheesecake, pineapple,

-bananas, strawberries, and marsh-

mallows. You will think you’ve
died and gone to heaven. Cost —
somewhat expensive, but worth it.

As far as I’m concerned,
Cedars is the best Middle Eastern
restaurant in Charlotte, located on
Sharon Amity.road. If you’re not
familiar with Middle Eastern food,
you really should try it; and there
are plenty of options for vegetar-
ians. Lunch here is much cheaper
than dinner, and the food is the
same, only with slightly smaller
portions. The combination platter
is a good way to familiarize your-
self with some of the most com-
mon types of Middle Eastern food.
There’s falafel, a kind of vegetar-
ian_hamburger— a round, fried

ball of grain and chick peas.
Hummus is like a garbanzo bean
paste. Tabouli is asalad made with ~
cracked wheat, parsley, and lemon
juice. And there are lamb, beef,
and chicken kebabs as well.

For dessert, sample baklava
and the extremely strong Turkish
coffee that will keep you awake for
hours. All the food at Cedar’s is
well-prepared and tasty, and eat-
ing there is an exciting foray into
cross-cultural fare.

This is obviously not an ex-
haustive list of the restaurants in
Charlotte. There are many more
which are equally as good. But
these are a few of my favorites.
And as you’re driving home, your
date Pat sleeping ina food-induced
coma in the passenger seat, you'll -
be glad you branched out.

Relieve stress with yoga

Stress continued from page 10

when we were poised in the push-

up position. “Lower your chest
andchin onto the floor, while keep-
ing your hips up toward the sky.”
The instructor called this the
“Down Dog position.” Everyone
softly descended to the floor, butts
in the air, exhaling in unison. Sud-
denly my toes slipped off my yoga
towel. I crashed to the floor, rug
burn down the side of my face. I

balled up my towel and hurled it.

against the wall. I was not going to
be defeated by a woman whocould
be my grandmother. If her body
could do it, so could mine. I mer-
cilessly contorted my limbs for the
next 40 minutes, pausing only to
wipe away the sweat pouring into
my eyes. Dammit, I was going to
get relaxed.

The hour ended with the whole

class covered by towels, lying flat
on the floor. When my heart
stopped pounding I once again
heard the peaceful new age music.
The instructor was telling us to
love ourselves, to feel our positive
wholeness in that special place
within. Afterwards, I walked over
to her, feeling dreamy and groggy.

“Thank you,” I said. “I really
enjoyed that.”

“Don’t tell me that was your
first yoga class,” she exclaimed. I
was too fuzzy to feel patronized.

“That was such a spiritual ex-
perience,” I said to my mother as I
limped out to the car.

So if you need a break from
the stress of exams and end-of-
semester demands, ask meto teach
you some yoga moves. You’ll be
surprised at the oneness you can
achieve with your body.
