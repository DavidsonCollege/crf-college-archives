Tournament - Tough

By CLIFF DUKE
Davidsonian Sports Writer

A few minutes after the
final buzzer sounded the
death knell for West Vir-
ginia last Saturday Coach
Lefty Driesell and Captain
Dick Snyder were hoisted
above the mass of screaming
humanity at one basket.
When they came down the
net to that goal came with
them, and Charlotte's Coli-
seum  reverberated with
noisy delirium.

This traditional act marked
the end of frustration for Dav-
idson, signifying the ‘Cats’ first
conference championship and
their right to advance further

than any of their predecessors.
The fans knew who the leaders
were, and they were shoved up
to cut down the symbolic net.

Snyder. the man called ‘‘Su-
perhorse” by the coach whose
team he beat, was named the
tournament's most valuable
player. This was only fitting,
for he was this team’s leader
from the opening tap of the sea-
son.

A NEW RECORD

The dark-thatched senior sur-
passed the college scoring rec-
ord by tallying 711 points, with
at least one game left to en-
hance this mark. Displaying a
tremendous assortment of shots.

Snyder fired baskets through the
hoop faster than all but four

‘other collegians. Yet this un-

selfish team captain demonstrat-
ed a team effort unequalled by
other prodigious scorers.

All season long he swept in
rebounds. guarded the oppon-
ent’s top scorer, nearly always
holding his man below his aver-
age. pased off for numerous
assists, and provided immeasur-
able inspiration and leadership
to a young team.

This year's squad. minus All-
American Fred Hetzel and three
other starters, was “‘destined”
for nowhere. This destiny was
prophe sied by basketball
scribes, but the word must not

THE INCOMPARABLE SUPERH ORSE IN ACTION AGAINST WVU
Snyder Leads His Young Teammates To 20th Win

Sailors Attend Meeting,
Grab Association Offices

Representatives of the David-
son College Sailing Club attend-
ed the South Atlantic Intercol-
legiate Sailing Association's win-
ter meeting at the University of
South Carolina, last week-end.
Delegates for the Davidson club
were Bob Murphy, Chip Bel-
lamy. and Bob Orr, faculty ad-
visor. .

The Wildcats are well repre-
sented on the newly elected
SAISA executive committee with
Murphy as president and Orr as

a member of the Board of Gov-
ernors.

Follow:ng elections Davidson
was unanimously approved for
regular membership in the As-
sociation. The loca! sailors spent
their first year in the organ-
ization as associate members
participating in all of the re-
gattas, but with no voice in the
administration.

Then William and Mary was
approved for associate member-

ship. thus increasing the As-
sociation to seven colleges and
universities in Virginia and the
Carolinas.

Davidson, because of its su-
perior facilities and central Joca-
tion, will host three SAISA
events: a team race with the
University of South Carolina on
March 19, an invitational re-
gatta for all the schools in the
association on April 23, and the
first Singlehand Championship
Regatta on May 7.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

=-*

:
;

have reached little Davidson.
There, in the friendly confines of
Johnston Gym, Snyder and four
guys with no starting varsity ex-
perience dedicated themselves to
a 20-win season, as Snyder ad-
mitted then, “I've got to work
harder now than ever before.”

It was pretty much up to him,
and from the start he exuded the
desire and leadership which
molded this team and helped
them mature. Listen to Bobby
Lane. “I can’t remember a sin-
gle day when he didn’t put forth
a tremendous effort. Yes, he def-
initely helped us mature by his
effort and constant encourage-
ment.”

A team player? Listen again.
“He knew that we could have a
good team, but he didn't want
it to be a one-man team. He
forced us to assume responsibil-
ity and then encouraged us.
Through his leadership we ac-
quired more poise and became
a real team.”

Bucky Waters. the West Vir-.
ginia mentor who has compared

, Snyder to the best in the South-

ern Conference and the nation,
remarked, ‘Snyder is the fellow
with the gun at your head for
40 minutes. He dominates the
game.’ He should know, for
last week-end Snyder pointed the
gun at the Mountaineers, and
all of his teammates had a fin-
ger on the trigger that shot them
down.

GREATEST THRILL

Although accorded the MVP
award, Snyder claimed that win-
ning the championship was his
greatest thrill. A three-sport
star in high school at Canton,
Ohio. who won All-American
honors as a football quarterback,
his teams never won any cham-
pionships. This is the first one he
can savor, but the taste won't
last long.

Next Monday night the Wild-
eats tackle the winner of the
Connecticut-Rhode Island play-
off in Philadelphia's Palestra.
Snyder is confident: of their
chances. His attachment to this
team is evident when he says,
“This team is not afraid to show
emotion. When things went bad
on the other team, (Hetzel and
Co.) everyone was cool. Now,
this team can get down on it-
self, but it can really get up.
This is how we finally won the
tournament, and this is how I
hope we'll continue.”

Snyder admits to many possi- |
bilities for the future. He can-|
not discount the challenge of pro
basketball, but he is not sure
if this is the career he wants.
A serious-minded business stu-
dent, he is interested in busi-
ness opportunities. He will also
talk to pro scouts about his fu-
ture in baseball.

But the present is clearly de-
fined. He will lead his team
into NCAA competition with a
bigger championship in mind, :
dedicated to “leaving some blood
up there before we come back.” i

’Cats Kall Jinx

(Cagers Repulse Late Rally,
Top WVU To Don Crown

By JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Associate Editor

Funny thing hap ened
Saturday night: Davi son’s
Wildcats—generally known
as long on brawn but short
on experience, finesse, and
capacity to win when the
chips are down—took all the
chips and walked away from
the dealer’s table with the
Southern Conference bas-
ketball championship and
the Coliseum nets to boot.

Displaying a desire and de-

termination so intense that one.

could not have found fault with
them -had they been beaten by
500 points, the young charges
of Lefty Drieseil trounced The
Citadel and. Richmond.in the pre-
liminaries and then proved too
hot and pressure-proof even for
the inspired play of a talented
West Virginia team, as the
Mountaineers succumbed 80-69,
in the finals of the conference
tournament te the double-barrel-
ed Wildcat assault of relent-
less defense and unusually well-
coordinated offense.
“GO COOL ‘CATS”

In spite of a sign urging ‘Go
Cool 'Cats", the Davidson con-
tingent was never even tem-
porarily chilly as fantastic Dick
Snyder, the best athlete to ever
wear a Wildcat uniform, con-
trolled the initial tap. raced
downcourt and took a pass to
score the game's first two
points.

The rest is history. The ‘Cats
shot well, hitting 53.8 per cent
on field goals and 82.8 per cent
on free throws to outshine the
Mounties’ respectable averages
of 46.6 per cent and 75 per cent.

Theytoutrebounded the smaller
West Virginians, 35-30, and they
worked better as a team, with
17 total assists, compared to 13
for the Mountaineers. Addition-

ally, the ‘Cats’ sticky man-to- -

man defense forced 15 West Vir-
ginia errors and 20 missed field
goals.

However, Davidson had shown
on several occasions this season
its ability to shoot well, to con-
tral the boards, and to play ag-
gressive defense. What their
critics still were not convinced
of was the Wildcats’ ability to
keep their poise against a good

team when the tide began to

turn, to shake off an opposition
rally and win the big game
when it counted.

THE PAST

Most remembered the past
two tournaments when Davidson
entries vastly superior to their
foes in personnel and individual
talents had fallen to fourth-seed-
ed teams which, on given nights
at least, were superior in effort.
determination, and ability to win
under pressure.

Recollection of these contests
became vivid as Bucky Waters’
crew—led in the front court by
Carl Head, a talented, although
undersized, center, and in the
back court by Ron Williams. a
sophomore who was good but
just not in Snyder's class, and
Gary Shaffer, a substitute guard
who played mostly on guts and
effort — narrowed a Davidson
lead which had been 16 points
to 65-63, with a little over five
minutes remaining.

It was at this point that the

Wildcats erased a stigma pin-
ned to past Davidson teams and
to this one after its season-open-
ing loss this year.

Snyder, Rod Knowles, Bobby
Lane, Phil Squier, and George
Leight, playing for the fouled-
out Tom Youngdale, took mat-
ters in hand and refused to
choke. One minute later, the
score was up to 71-63 and with
this lead the. Cats coasted on to
their final margin.

SNYDER

Snyder, an All-America, for
everyone who has seen him play,
was, as usual, fabulous. In three
tourney games he scored 78
points and grabbed 18 rebounds
to win the series’ Most Valu-
able Player Award. But sta-
tistics hardly begin ‘o indicate
his value. °

The former “Soph Sensation’,
now a_ senior

which had not seen truly effec-
tive leadership since Bill Jar-
man captained the ‘Cats three
years ago. With this leadership,
Snyder combined a scoring abil-
ity which equaled that of Fred
Hetzel and a habit of exhibiting
the fiery determination and 100
per cent ,effort that was the

trademark of Barry Teague dur-

ing the three previous years.
There were more heroes.

Overshadowing Williams for
the top sophomore performance
of the tourney was Knowles, who
scored 25 points in the finals to
achieve a 52-point total for the
three-game affair. Yet the most
impressive facet of the 6-9 soph's

performance was his bruising '

play under the boards, as
Knowles garnered 27 rebounds
in the tournament while dispos-

ing of any thyughts that he |

would not put out a maximum
effort.

Youngdale, another soph and
the third of Davidson's big men,
really came into his own during
the tourney, personally taking
charge of the Wildcats’ spurt
away from Richmond Friday
night and finishing the tourna-
ment with 37 points and 22 re-
bounds. Here the 6-10 strongman
showed everyone, including him-
self, how effective he can be
when he decides to get tough.

‘Lane, as all through the sea-
son, was determination and ef-
fort personified. The 6-4 -sopho-
more guard amazingly led both
teams in the finale in rebound-
nig, pulling down 10 Saturday
night and 21 during the tour-
ney. Lane, who tallied 38 points,
drew the toughest defensive as-
signments, guarding players
such as Citadel’s Wig Bau-
mann, Richmond's Johnny
Moates, and West Virginia's Wil-
liams and John wesher. Holding
All-Conference Moates to a sea-
son scoring low of six points.
Lane never knew the meaning of
the word ‘‘quit."’

And then there was Squier,
the senior guard who bore the
brunt of the furious pressing
defenses the Wildcats faced. The
5-11 New Jerseyite, who prob-
ably wanted to win more than
anyone else, led l.efty’s charges
in assists while directing the
Davidson offensive attack. In the
face of the formidable West
Virginia rally, Squier refused to

view, by a Davidson banner
which read, “Tough Lucky,
