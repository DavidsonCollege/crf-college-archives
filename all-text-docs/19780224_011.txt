Tourney balance prevents easy picks

By JIMMY SNYDER
Sports Columnist

The Southern Conference
basketball tournament features
a well-balanced field. Any one
of the six teams pose a threat to
capture the title. Only the
Citadel and Western Carolina
appear to be outmanned. First
round action begins this Satur-
day. The four winners will
advance to Roanoke, Va. on
March 3 and 4 for the semi-final
and final rounds of the tourney.

Top-seeded Appalachian
should have little trouble de-
feating the Citadel Bulldogs in
Boone. The Mountaineers pos-
sess one of the most balanced
scoring attacks in the Southern
Conference led by Darry] Robin-
son (18 ppg) and Renaldo
Lawrence (17 ppg). Tony Sear-
cy provides inside power with
16 points and 12 rebounds a
game. ASU features the second-
best shooting and rebounding
team in the conference. This
consistency could prove to be
the decisive factor as the Apps
try to add the tournament title
and NCAA bid to their regular
season crown.

The Citadel will counter with
guards Randy Nesbit and Rick
Swing, along with improving
pivotman Tom Slawson. The
Bulldogs will need their best
effort of the season in order to
upset ASU on the Apps’ home

court. :
First-year coach Stu

Aberdeen’s Marshall Thunder-
ing Herd could be a darkhorse

candidate to win the title.
Marshall’s impressive victories
over Appalachian and VMI
prove that the Herd is capable
of playing very good ball.

points a game, is supported by
Harley Major, Greg Young, and
freshman point guard Greg
White. If 6’11”” Danny Hall, a
transfer pivotman from
Kentucky plays well inside, the
Herd could become a formidable

foe in Roanoke.
The Catamounts of Western

Carolina have little hope of
upsetting Marshall on the
Herd’s home court. WC fea-
tures a one man show in Bubba
Wilson (23 ppg). Terry Ruther-
ford adds strength inside with 8
rebounds a game.

The Furman-UT Chattanoo-
ga matchup at Greenville
should provide the best contest
of the opening round. Furman

18 points and 13 rebounds a
game. His balanced supporting
cast includes Al Daniel and
freshman sharpshooter Rodney
Arnold.

The Moccassin attack is
paced by Edsel Brooks (who
shot well outside against the
Cats), Keith Parker, and Wil-
liam Wright. The quick pres-
sing Moccassins are defending
Division II national champions,
but depend on youth this year
after having been decimated by
graduation. Look for Furman’s
home court advantage to offset
the performance of defensive
specialist Bruce ‘‘Blowdry’’
Grimm in a narrow Paladin
victory.

Tankers end successful year

By SKIP BARKLEY

Staff Writer i
The Davidson swimmers fin-

ished their season with a 10 - 5
record and a respectable fourth
place finish in the Southern
conference swimming and div-
ing championships. For this
year’s senior class of Mike
Knowles, Jonathan Washburn,
Marshall Brown, and Jim
Wood, this accomplishment is
the result of a constant im-
provement in the swimming
program which has taken place
every year since they were
freshmen.

This year’s team could be the
best in the sport’s history at
Davidson, although the record
may not reflect this. The true
indication of the team’s excel-
lence may be seen in the fact
that fourteen school records
were set this year. In fact, this
team holds all but one of the
school records. R

Coach Pat Miller termed the
season ‘‘successful’’ and was
pleased with all the records that
were set. She was also pleased
with the way the team as a
whole bettered their own per-
sonal goals. ‘‘Although every-
one didn’t set records, everyone
did improve on their best times.
I’m proud of that fact and I
think it attests to the team’s
hard work.”

As for next year, the outlook
is positive, although the gra-
duation of Jonathan Washburn

and a strong senior class will
detinitely be felt. However, the
yreerivitine =ffnrt seems to be

going quite well. According to
Coach Miller, two all-state
swimmers from Florida have
already committed to David-
son. Hopefully their addition,
along with some other possible
recruits will offset the loss of
the seniors.

The season is over for all the
swimmers except two. Jona-

than Washburn and sophomore
Mark Tommerdahl will parti-
cipate in the Duke Invitational
on March 3-5. This will give
them the chance to go against
some ACC competition. Wash-
burn will also attempt to cap-
ture the only school record
which this year’s team does not
hold -- the 100 yd. freestyle.

Gunners fall short

By THOMAS NIBLOCK
Staff Writer

The Rifle Team returned from
the Western Carolina Confer-
ence Championship in Spartan-
burg, S.C., with a disappoint-
ing fourth place finish.

The Cats, who finished the
regular season in a tie for
second place had been looking
for a second place tournament
finish behind Appalachian
State. Instead, they placed
fourth behind Appalachian,
Presbyterian, and South Caro-

lina State in the tournament.”
Clemson University finished

fifth, Wofford College was sixth
and Wake Forest brought up

the rear in seventh position.
‘‘Unavoidable scheduling

problems probably hurt us the
most,’’ commented coach Ran-
som Cooper. ‘‘Both of our
tournaments fall at the end of
the term making it especially

difficult for the team to devote
much time to practice.”

Even with the poor showing
Saturday the Rifle Team is in

high spirits. The Cats finished
their regular season with a
record.of 15-6.

Their last regular season
match was on Feb. 12 when
they coasted to easy victories
over the University of Tennesee
at Chattanooga and N.C.A. &
4M.

_ High shooter for Davidson

was team captain Tom Miller at

264. Katherine Whitney and

*Reed Ellis posted 262 and 256

“Fespectively, while John Par-

_ham shot a 251.

w Robbie Kirkendol rounded
out the top five at 246, followed
by Tom Niblock and Mike
Pearson, who shot 242 and 217
respectively. This Saturday the
team travels to VMI for the
Sourthern Conference Champ-
ionshin.

The Wildcats face a tough
uphill struggle if they are to
capture their first Southern
Conference title since 1970.
Second-seeded and defending
champion VMI dominated the
Cats both offensively and de-
fensively in an impressive 89-69
Keydet victory last month.
That loss was the turning point
for the. Wildcats’ season, as
they dropped nine of their last
ten games after registering an
impressive victory over South
Carolina.

The disciplined Keydet at-
tack is paced by all-conference
player Ron Carter. Carter has
edged by Davidson star John
Gerdy in the conference scoring
race by less than three one-hun-
dredths of a point. Bad Bernard
revealed in an exclusive inter-
view that he believes the
“conference player of the year
will be determined in VMI’s
‘pit’ Saturday night.”’

Davidson must have a ba-

lanced team effort in order to-

advance to the final four at
Roanoke. VMI leads the confer-

ence in both team defense and
rebounding while the Cats are
last in each category. Therein
lies the key to the contest. The
Cats must find a solid defense
to combine with their great
shooting ability. Hopefully, the
team effort exhibited in the first
half of the recent Furman game
can mold with a healthy John
Gerdy and steadily improving
Rich DiBenedetto for a Cinder-
ella story in the 1978 tourna-
ment. If the underdog Wildcats
can pull of the upset at Lexing-
ton on Saturday they would
have a good chance of winning
the title on a neutral court.

However, the odds are with
the teams possessing home
court advantages in the first
round. Look for Appalachian
(defeating Furman) and VMI
(defeating Marshall) in the
finals with Appalachian aveng-
ing last year’s narrow loss. Yet,
the well-balanced field and the
explosiveness of Marshall and
Furman could shoot these pre-
dictions all to hell. In that case,
GO CATS!
