PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Mounting per-
haps the most stunning comeback victory in.
program history, Davidson’s cardiac kids
clawed their way back from a 19-point half-
time deficit here on Sunday to stun Canisius
and capture the BankRI Brown Classic tour-
nament trophy.

The Wildcats—who trailed by double dig-
its with as few as five minutes to play—
stormed into overtime on a heroic buzzer-
beating three-point jumper by freshman
Ashley Hallsted.

Junior forward Kelly Copland grabbed
Tournament MVP honors and Hallsted joined
her on the All-Tournament team.

Slow Off the Block

Canisius jumped out to a quick 20-1 llead,
riding the broad, multi-talented shoulders of
junior forward Shauna Geronzin.

A fast-paced, tenacious and physical Grif-
fin defense stifled Davidson’s offensive at-
tack, holding the ‘Cats to a meager 21 points
in the first half.

Meanwhile, Canisius steadily accrued an
imposing lead while Davidson found itself
deeper and deeper in a hole as the first half
came to a close.

Copland named MVP

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Junior forward
Kelly Copland earned Tournament MVP
honors with a gritty two-day performance
at the BankRI Brown Classic.

Copland scored 39 points over the two-
day tournament, including a career-best
24 to key a miraculous comeback against
Canisius in Sunday’s championship game.

“Kelly Copland was fantastic,” said a
beaming head coach John Filar. “I was so
pleased and happy for her after all the
injuries she went through last year. Kelly
Copland today was the player we recruited
out of high school three years ago. She
tuned in one of the toughest performances
I’ve ever seen.”

Copland did, it tall. She knocked down
three-pointers. She grabbed rebounds on
both ends of the court. She rattled oppo-
nents with a vigorous defensive intensity.

And she delivered bone-shattering screens
of the sort that will keep area chiropractors
in business for a long, long time.

One such screen came late in the game,
as a tenacious Griffin defender was racing
Wildcat point guard Ashley Hallsted down
court. Copland set up for a screen along
the sideline and absorbed the blow of the
oncoming Canisius guard, knocking her
target to the hardwood—and drawing a
clutch foul. Copland would go to the free
throw line and knock down a pair of free
throws tobring Dedten clone toconten-
tion.

Then she would score four points in the
overtime period, sealing her selection as
the tournament MVP. ;

But Canisius made what would provetobe _

a fatal blunder as the squad celebrated in their
halftime locker room—just one thin wall

‘across from where Coach Filar and his staff

were trying to regroup and reignite their strug-
gling squad.

“We played an atrocious first half,” ac-
knowledged Hallsted. “But then I heard
Canisius celebrating in their locker room next
door. It put a fire in my belly, we had to let
them know they couldn’t do this to us.”

On a Mission

Though a bit sluggish out of the gates again
in the second half, Davidson would stalk
Canisius from afar, gradually chipping away
at the momentous deficit.

“We had to convince the girls not to try and
get it back all at one time,” said head coach

John Filar. “And our girls responded. They:

just reached down inside and showed a lot of
heart. Once we started on the comeback trail,
they just weren’t going to quit. It was incred-
ible—it’s a huge credit to the types of kids we
have.”

After scrapping away at the Canisius ad-
vantage for fourteen minutes, the Wildcats
still found
themselves
down 64-50
with 6:20 to
play, but re-
fused to quit.

But then Copland delivered a bone-crush-
ing screen to a Canisius defender, drawing a
foul and going to the free throw line—where
she hit both ends of a one-and-one to close the
gap to 66-64.

Canisius maintained a 70-65 lead with 22.8
ticks left on the clock. Davidson brought the
ball up court, but struggled to find an open
shot until Leah Uhernik let loose a three-
pointer with 8.4 seconds to go that narrowed
the gap to 70-68.

Davidson immediately fouled the inbound
play, sending Jill Knapic to the line with 7.8
seconds to go and a two-point lead. The 5-8
Griffin guard netted the first free throw, but
her second bounced off the rim short.

Taylor secured the rebound and outletted to
Hallsted who drove up the court as the clock
wound down.

“We were getting ready to run a free throw
break,” Hallsted recalled. “I was on the right
side of the court—waiting for Janna to be-
come open, but she was covered. I heard
everyone counting down, then I heard Coach
Filar yell ‘That’s you Ash!’ so I shot it...”

The ball barely cleared the outstretched
fingertips of a would-be Griffin shot-blocker
and sailed seamlessly
toward the rim — splash-
ing through the net as
the final horn sounded.

“Ashley’s shot at the
buzzer was just a cold-
blooded dagger,” Filar
said. “You looked at
Canisius’ faces after she
hit that shot, and you
knew they were in
trouble. Then I looked
over at Ashley and she

all. She was like, ‘Heck
yeah, I knew it was goin’
down.”

Taylor snatched a defensive rebound and was
fouled by Canisius star Geronzin, her fifth on
the night.

Frustrated and faltering by fouling out,
Geronzin earned a technical foul immediately
after—decisively swinging the course of the
game.

“(Geronzin) got that technical because Kim
outhustled her and (Geronzin) got mad,”
Hallsted described. “Now she’s out of the
game and that made a huge difference.

“Canisius’ attitudes were crushed when their
go-to girl fouled out,” said Hallsted. “They
started to lose composure, they started snap-
ping at each other out on the floor.”

Janna Magette would sink a pair of techni-
cal free throws and Taylor converted the front
of a one-and-one to bring Davidson within
two.

An Ashley Hallsted jumper with 3:27 to

Then with 0:54 to go in the overtime,
Magette came up with a huge play—inter-
cepting a pass and driving coast-to-coast for a
go-ahead layup.

Canisius answered, tying the game at 79
with 0:36 to go.

But then Ashley Hallsted, once again, put
Davidson ahead once and for all with a short
baby jumper with twenty seconds to go.

Kelly Copland secured a defensive rebound,
drew a foul and netted two free throws to seal
the deal with a second and a half to play.

“This was a great weekend for us,” said

coach Filar. “[Our girls] believe in each other

whatever we want to do if we have good team

The contest setures numerous heroes— _

many of them were first-year Wildcats play-

contest.

“We don’t have any freshmen anymore, as.

big time.”

With the victory, Davidson i improves toa
startling 4-2 record—having played five of
their first six contests on the road.

“Right now, on December 3, we can’t tell
how important this weekend really was,”
said Filar. “But when we look back on it in
February, this weekend might very well be
one of the most important of the season for

us.

Looking Ahead.

The ‘Cats jump back into Southern Con-
ference action when they host East Tennes-
see State at Belk Arena on Wednesday.
Davidson hopes to improve on its 0-1 con-
ference record.

Filar will hope to channel the emotional
energy of this weekend into a concerted
challenge against a strong ETSU squad.

“You have to stay really balanced in this
profession and in this game,” said the sev-
enth-year head coach. “It’s never as good or
as bad as it seems.”

Sweet homecoming for Taylor

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — This weekend’s
action had special significance for senior
center Kim Taylor, as the tournament
marked a homecoming trip for the Wild-
cats’ 6-3 center out of Portsmouth Abbey.

Taylorreturned home in triumphant fash-
ion, helping Davidson capture the BankRI
Brown Classic in front of dozens of friends,
family members, and supporters.

None went home disappointed.

The wildly athletic Taylor made one of
the game’s most crucial plays late in the
‘second period—grabbing a rebound and
drawing both a personal and technical foul
from a frustrated Shauna Geronzin, send-,
ing the Griffin star to the bench fouled out.

“(Geronzin) got that technical because
Kim outhustled her and (Geronzin) got
mad,” described teammate Ashley Hallsted.
“Now she’s out of the game and that made
ahuge difference. Canisius’ attitudes were
crushed... I nk ‘acme ‘was Sennitely the
play of the game.”

_ Taylor went on to score three clutch
baskets and secure game-altering rebounds,
not the least of which came with seven
seconds to play in regulation that resulted
inan Ashley Hallsted buzzer-beating three-
pointer.

“She was on the court to help’ ‘us win an
enormous game on her senior trip home,”
said head coach John Filar. “I’m so happy
for her.”

The center position has eee a crowded
one this year—with seniors Taylor and
Jess Heath aswell as freshman Meghan
Bryant vying for time. But as the game
entered critical moments, Taylor got the
nod in front of her home crowd.

“That means everything to me,” she said.
“Tt meant a lot to be on the floor with that
win.”
