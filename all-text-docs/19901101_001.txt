RELATIONS

Calling on family ties with
Davidson that stretch back for 60
years and now extend farand wide,
D.G. Martin told a Fall Convoca-
tion audience of students and par-
ents thatcourageis the greatest gift
they can give each other.

——Among—those—listening—to-—

Martin, a 1962 graduate now serv-
ing as secretary of the University
of North Carolina, were more than

75 relatives and family friends who '

were reunited on campus for. two
events honoring his late father, D.
Grier Martin, and mother, Louise
McMichael Martin,

On Friday afternoon, the col-
lege dedicated the area around three
new dormitories as “The D. Grier
Mtn Court” in honor of the man
who served as Davidson president
from 1958 until 1968. The follow-

ing morning a garden beside the
president’s house was dedicated as
“The Louise McMichael Martin
Garden” to honor his widow, a
woman still living in Davidson who
led the effort to preserve and re-
store the president’s house when
its: demolition was being consid-
ered.

D.G. Martin’s address was the

occasion during which many stu-
dent and faculty awards were an-
nounced. It was also Parents Week-
end, so Martin told the Love Audi-
torium crowd that the separation
of parents and children that col-
lege brings leads to questions about
life’saccomplishments. Parents are
always guaging their actions by
asking what their children would
think, and children are always
asking what their parents would

Support For Gantt
Visible On Campus

By TOM KOONCE

Although next week’s election
between Harvey Gantt, the black
Democrat and former mayor of
Charlotte, and Jesse Helms, the
18-year Republican incumbent
proves to be one of the closest
Senate races in the nation this fall,
one could barely discern this fact
by the political activity of students
at Davidson.

~~ During Fall Convocation sev-
eral seniors attached Ganttstickers
to their gowns. In Chambers a
large bullentin board in the main
hall displays two large photos of
Gantt along with the candidate’s

position on several issues. Clearly,
the Students for Harvey Gantt com-
mittee has been very visible on
campus. since their organization
early in the school year.

Yet, there has been no publicly
organized effort by students in
support of Helms. The smaller
display: in Chambers of a Helms
sticker, pamphlets comparing
Gantt’s position with Senator Ted
Kennedy and propaganda for other

Republican candidates represents

the only work done by College Re-
publicans.

Inactivity by Helms’ backers
may be based on antipathy by many
students against their candidate.

Exhibited on the College Republi-
can’s bullentin board is picture of
Helms, defaced by an pen-marked
“on his face.

Has this lead to embarrasment
and fear in supporting Helms?
Freshmen Kyle Kenner, a Helms
supporter, comments, “It could be
nice if people were not so ostra-
cized for supporting Helms and
they would come out and support
him more openly.”

However, does the Students
for Harvey Gantt committee feel,
like many North Carolinians, that
Gantt can pull it off?. According
