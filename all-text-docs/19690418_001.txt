One of the
selling points in persuading

near perfect record the de-

in securing preferred assign-
ments. :

Coi. Frederick B. Outlaw,
professor of military scjence,
said that some of the 38 por-
cent are “under review and
analysis,’ and seniors were
told in ROTC‘classes this
week that the Davidson de-
purtment was sending ‘‘full

ment of the Army for recon-
sidering many of the assign-
ments,

that not cjl were assigned ‘to

Of the students who recelv-
ed their first choice, a ma-
jority were pre-med or had
been designated Distinguish-
ed Military Students..

Outlaw has been on the
phone to Washington and
Third Army headquarters
daily in trying to get the de-
cisions reversed, necording
to a department spokesman.

Failure to receive one of
the three choices was an
“Army-wide" phetomenon to
the adjutant al Wofford Col-
lege. where one third of the
seniors did not receive one
of their requests.

Maj. Ted M. Lewis said
that the number receiving
their preference was “much
lower’ than in the past, but
said the department was
making no effort to change
the assignments because
“none of our (cadets) have
any grounds" for change.
