____ To Steve Heckard for his phenomenal performance
in the Mississippi College game, his first starting quarter- ,

back assignment since junier high. Heckard’s elusive- ;
ness was no big surprise, as he had exhibited his talents!

in this area from his old end position. But his amazingly |;

accurate passing (9 for 10), and his perceptive choice of
plays, especially in the pressure-packed fourth quarter,

exceeded even the most optimistic expectations. David- | fy
son has never exactly been noted for its outstanding} .

uarterbacks, but, if Heckard continues in the same

orm, it looks like the Wildcats will finally have at the|;
key position a man in whom they can have justified |,

confidence.
To Pack Hindsley for his blocking, pass receiving,
and aggressive defensive work. Hindsley was one of the

few Wildcats who played both ways, but the strain of é

double duty didn’t show on the converted halfback as

he made his presence on offense and defense very well | if

known to the Choctaws of Mississippi.

To Jim Terry for his no-miss extra point placements
and for his game-winning, last-second field goal. He had
as much pressure on him as he’ll ever have, but he
didn't choke when the chips were down.

To Bill Rikard for his diving catches in final quarter
which led to Davidson's winning points. The game was
Rikard's first in varsity competition, and he came through
big. It’s the extra effort such as his that wins ball
games and that the Wildcats seemed to generally lack
during the last couple of years.

_ To fullback Pat Fisher for his 100% effort every
time he carried. At 171 pounds, Fisher is among the
smallest college fullbacks around, but his never-say-die
running makes him the reliable performer that any suc-
cessful team has to have.

___ To the Wildcat defense which bottled up the Miss-
issippi attack in the last period, enabling the ’Cat of-
fense to gain ball possession and score.

To the Davidson team for continuing to fight and
overcoming a 14-point deficit to win. As somebody in
the stands ‘said Saturday, it seemed very unDavidson-like
to come from behind to win. In any event, it’s a real
accomplishment for any team to come from as far back
as the ’Cats were Saturday with such little time left.

To the Mississippi defendér who pushed Rikard.

CONVERTED QUARTERBACK STEVE HECKARD
“You Can’t Catch It If Nobody Can Throw 11”

Flickerball Brings Few
Surprises In Slow Start

The first week of IMAC flickerball action was rather

Surprising

Standout In QB Debut

By TOM COOK

What does one expect of an end when he plays his

first game at quarterback? No one expects him to com-.

plete 90% of his passes, no one expects him to gain 130
yards passing, including 29 on one touchdown toss, or
especially, no one expects him to throw two touchdown

passes.

Therefore Steve Heckard sur-
prised a lot of people last Sat-
urday at Richardson Field.

What looked like a black af-
ternoon for the Wildcats, turn-

Squad

Wins Opener

An exciting score in the
fina) two minutes of play hand-
ed the Wildcat soccer team a
narrow 1-0 victory over a sur-
prisingly much improved Bel-
mont Abbey squad Thursday.

Center Jan Brakel booted in
the only goal of the day follow-

4|ing a set-up play which display-

the excellent teamv ork
which led Dr. Marrotte to com-
ment that the “Davidson team
looked better than any David-

i!son team I've seen.” Balance,

coordination, and spirit were
the keynotes to the successful
day and “every man played
his position well.”

Despite the low score, the
Wildcats held possession of the

. be ball for the greater part of the

teams playing about evenly. But
the second quarter was the
scene of a Davidson press in
which the Wildcats had posses
sion of the ball in their oppo-
nent’s territory. Kurt Pederson
and Brakel were particularly
noted as outstanding for the
setting up of plays. Several goal
attempts were made but without
success, the ball bouncing from
the bars, the posts, and the Bel-
mont Abbey goalie.

Not until the fourth quarter
did the Davidson men again
take to the field. But although

the plays set up well, again the
goal in all but Brakel’s last

afternoon.

Clemson grabbed the lead
from the gun and held .it for
most of the first half of the
race. Then at the two mile
mark, Andy -Little took the
lead for the Wildcats.

However, Little could not

distanced the pack, posting a
good 23:07.00 for the slippery

Dean and Little finished sec
ond and third respectively for
the Wildcats. John Barrow and
Tommy Hefner tied for fifth,
and seconds later, Jesse Sims
wrapped it up for Whittle’s
Whizzes with a seventh place.

Coach Heath Whittle seemed
well pleased with the results
of the season’s opener. He was
quick to point out that Clem-
son, a member of the Atlantic
Coast Conference, will not be
the strongest foe that the thin-
clads face this year, but still
it was “a nice win for the first
of the season.”

Dole will continue his unit
substitution that was a prime
factor in the ‘Cats’ 17-14 vic-
tory over Mississippi College
last Saturday. Also, with the
confidence gained from nine
pass completions in ten attempts
and a 12-yard run out of a sticky
fourth and ten situation, the
field guidance of Steve Heckard
will possibly be even more note-
worthy in his second game at
quarterback.

Coach Tom Stevens. who
scouted Citadel, says of Coach
Eddie Teague’s boys, ‘They're
always well-conditioned and
well-coached — a tough team.
They have a well-rounded run-
ning attack .. they have a
varied attack... a lot of of-
fense . . . they could run a
whole new offensive series
against us.” ,

Stevens respects their de-
fense. too. “They did a great job
against West Virginia. Army
just had a great quarterback.”’

Who must the . Wildcats
watch? ‘“Lane,"’ says the scout.

‘He's a real good boy. He's
the one we'll have to stop.”

Davidson's squad, initially
lacking depth anyway, was fur-
ther weakened by injures at
halfback. Lyle Blalock, a starter
on offense, suffered a dislocat-
ed shoulder, but. Dole hopes
that a shoulder brace will en-
able him to see some action
this week.

“This team did it against Furman and again

against the University of Mex-
ico. We warned the officials
about it before the game...
but I don't remember it ever
being called."

Following a Wildcat fumble on
the first play of the game, the
Choctaws proceeded to score in
six plays on a thirteen-yard run
by halfback Jerry Hale. Poor
field position limited the David-
son attack for the rest of the
half, although the defense was
able to hold the Choctaws in the
clutch.

After a Mississippi touchdown
at the start of the second half.
the Wildcats began to move.
‘scoring at the end of. the third
quarter on a four-yard pass
from Heckard to Steve Smith
and a conversion by Jim Terry.
A perfect twenty-nine-yard pass
from Heckard to Pack Hinds-
ley and Terry's conversion tied
the score at fourtecn-all in the
fourth quarter.

A pass interference call help-
ed set up the eighteen-yard field
goal by Terry that provided
the winning margin in the last
four seconds of the game.

“Sufficient rest enabled us to
do a good job in the fourth
quarter," said Dole. ‘‘The alter-
nating of offensive and defen-
sive units was of great import-
ance in maintaining better phy-
sical condition.”

“The better club lost,” said
Choctaw Coach Hartwell Mc-
Phail, ‘I don't know what hap-
pened. Maybe it was. just too
easy for us at first, and our boys
just laxed off. Davidson kept
scrapping back all the time . .
Penalties hurt us a lot.”’
