Variety of Books
Added to Library}

Modern Works on Philosophy,
History, Music, and Science
Among Those Selected

MANY UNUSUAL BOOKS

Works on Religion of Today Well
Represented

Many distinctive and modern books
have been added to the College Library
recently. Students of philosophy will
be interested to know that among the
new volumes are Richard C, Cabot’s
“The Meaning of Right and Wrong,”
and “The Journal of Gamaliel Brad-
ford,” edited by Van Wyck Brooks.
The latter has been called, “One of
the most notable revelations of the
mind-workings of a writer that has yet
come out of America.”

In the field of novels, Miss Cornelia
Shaw, librarian, announced: the com-
pleted series of “The Tale of the
Genii,” translated from the story writ-
ten by Lady Murasaki, of Japan, in
the year one thousand; “The Imperial
Palace,” an exciting history of modern
life, by Arnold Bennett; and “To a
God Unknown,” by John Steinbeck.

“Behemoth—The Story of Power,”
by Eric Hodgins and F. Alexander
Magouin, is a thrilling narrative of the
rise of power in the world from the
primitive day, two centuries old, down
to modern marvels of gigantic machin-
ery. It will catch and hold the atten-
tion of all those interested in sound
science, history, biography, and the
newest wonders of the world.

TWo books which will move and con-
vince even the most disinterested read-
er are “Beside Galillee,’” by Hector
Bolitho, and “Robert E. Lee, The
Christian,” by William J. Johnstone.
The former is a first hand survey of
Zionism> and¢ Modern Palestine, and
the latter isoa portrayal of the relig-
ious life of Robert E. Lee.

“The New Encyclopedia of Music
and Musicians,” edited by Waldo Sel-
don Pratt; “The Forest of Adventure,”
by Raymond Ditmars, and “A Short
History of Costume and Armour” from
1066 to 1800, by Francis M. Kelley and
Randolph Schwabe, are other books
that will appeal to various readers. The
“New Encyclopedia of Music and Mu-
sicians” is said to contain “something
about everything and everybody in
music, and what is still more impor-
tant, the means for finding out more
if more is wanted.”

Pills Brothers Render
Varied Entertainment

“Ladies and gentlemen, the Pills
Brothers. of Davidson will now render
their popular radio skit.” Such was
the introduction of the trio on one of
their early visits to appear on the stage
in Statesville. That would have been
all very well if they had known that
they were expected to do a radio skit,
but that announcement was the first
they had heard of it. True to fash-
ion, however, they filled the bill and
were equal to the occasion.

Ever since their freshman year the
Pills Brothers, D. P. McLain, D. G.
Monroe, and W. L. Northern, have
been singing together at various places
in and around Davidson. Their first
appearance was at a concert of the
glee club and orchestra, during their
freshman year.

All three of the boys are Phi Gams,
““and it was through their fraternity
that they met and began to sing to-
gether. Ever since, they have helped
their brothers pass many a long winter
evening by entertaining the group as
it was gathered around a roaring fire.
Among the many places at which
they have sung are the S & W in Char-
lotte, the Charlotte Hotel, Queens-Chi-
cora College, Belmont, Pinehurst, Win-
ston-Salem, Greensboro, Red Springs,
Aberdeen, Mooresville, and Statesville.
They have sung for private banquets,
on the stage and over the radio.

As evidenced by their type of sing-
ifig they believe in popular music, ex-
pressing the belief that it might even
be classed as American folk music.

The Pills Brothers are to be in

«charge of the entertainment for Junior
Speaking dances. To them goes the
credit for the idea of having a mas-
querade ball at the Friday night dance.

Fort Is Re-elected
Wrestling Captain

C. M.-Fort, captain of the varsity
wrestling team, was re-elected captain

captain of the wrestling squad for two
successive years,

R. H. Porter was elected varsity

. Manager for next year, and Phifer Er-
win, assistant manager.

Ault Urges U. S. to
Enter World Court

(By Associated ‘Collegiate Press)

Boston, Mass.—(Special)—Imploring
President Roosevelt and his advisers
to give the United States a new deal
in. foreign relations, Prof. Warren O.
Ault, head of Boston University’s his-
tory department, urges that the United
States enter the World Court and sign
the four-power pact.

“The time has come,” this historian
asserts, “when we must either arm
ourselves to the teeth, or take prac-
tical measures to keep out of war, Posi-
tive, constructive leadership towards
peace is what we need. I believe that
it would help to join the,World Court,
even at this late date. We might enter
into the four-power pact in Europe and
make it a five-power pact. France
would feel more secure.”

Pointing out that there is a marked
drift in the world today toward dic-
tatorships, Professor Ault continued:

“There has also been a marked drift
towards actual military preparedness.
This is seen in the downward trend
of disarmament activities. While in-
tentions have been good, nothing of
value has been done at any of the
recent disarmament conferences. Ap-
parently you cannot disarm a country
with ‘agreements; a loophole always
will be found.

“If we do not arm ourselves to a
certain extent, the country is said ‘to
be criminally negligent in the protec-
tion of its people; if we do builld bat-
tleships and such protection, other na-
tions believe we are preparing for war.

“Whatever the cost, we must avoid
war psychosis. One cannot act nat-
ural when it is on us. The worst ele-
ments in people come to the front, and
stay there for years afterwards. That
way lies madness,” the Boston profes-

sor concluded.

States Responsible

e e
For Higher Education
(By Associated Collegiate Press)
New York City — (Special) — That
each state is responsible for higher
education within its borders, that this
responsibility extends to private as
well as public institutions, and that the
commonwealths should invoke their
licensing powers to assure a_ higher
quality of education, was asserted by
Howard J. Savage, secretary of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advance-
ment of Teaching, in the 28th annual
report of. the foundation.

“The tenet that a state’s responsibil-
ity extends to the field of higher edu-
cation does not imply that all higher
education should be controlled by the
state or supported by the state,” Mr.
Savage said in qualifying, his state-
ment. “Nor is the infererice justified
that privately supported colleges and
universities maintain lower standards
of work than publicly supported insti-
tutions, or vice versa.”

This responsibility of the state im-
plies, according to Mr. Savage: “ First,
the state has an obligation to provide
opportunities for the education of its
people at the higher levels, preferably
within its own borders. Secondly, it
has an obligation to assure its people
that the quality of education it makes
available in any institution it charters
is good.”

In discussing the use of the charter-
ing power by the state, Mr. Savage
continued :

“The diversity of provision in the
several states for the chartering of
universities and colleges has a direct
bearing upon the possibility of any
state’s assuring its people even merely
adequate quality*in higher education.
The uses of the licensing power re-
specting the practice of the professions
tend in the same direction. “Appar-
ently it is recognized that the state is
obligated to defend itself against not
only inferior individuals but inferior
institutions,

“Yet the constitutional or statutory
power for legislatures to annul or mod-

ify educational charters is not by any
means country-wide, and only a few
states provide for direct supervision

by—state_authority after incorporation.

In general, then, it may be said that
most of the states of the Union have
set up no truly adequate device for
guaranteeing the quality of the edu-
cation to be had in the colleges and
universities that they charter.

“This statement is not to be con-
strued as a plea for standardization in
higher education among the states,”
Mr. Savage concludes. “It may, how-
ever, imply some such question as fol-
lows: How may any state best dis-
charge its responsibility respecting the
quality of its institutions of higher
education.”

Many Freshmen Out
For Centennial Nine

Prospects Bright With Thirty-
five Candidates Out

Freshman baseball prospects look
quite promising and a good season is
anticipated by Coach Gene McEver.
Practice having started very recently,
not much can be determined as to who
will play the various positions. Some
show more promise than others, but
the ones who work hardest are the
ones who will make the grade, is the
verdict of the coaches.

About thirty-five candidates have
been reporting for practice for the
last week, the majority of which ate
out to win a post in the outfield.

As for the infield, Quick at short
and Howard at third show much prom-
ise. Dickson and Lanier look good
behind the plate and Olschner, Gracey
and McKinney appear to be the best
prospects for mound work.

The freshman schedule is as follows:
March 29, Belmont Abbey, at Belmont;
April 12, Gastonia High at Davidson;
18, Belmont Abbey at Davidson; 27,
Gastonia High at Gastonia; 28, Louis-
burg at Davidson; May 1, Wake For-
est freshmen at Wake Forest; 2, Louis-
burg at Louisburg; 3, Duke freshmen
at Durham.

dance. Everyone is urged to be on
time.

Johnny Long has. attained much
fame, and has been classed as one of
the best college orchestras in the
South, He played for the Roosevelt
Ball in Raleigh, which was a very dis-
tinct success. He has also played for -
college dances in Virginia and North
Carolina. He features the Wayne King
type of music, has three vocalists, and
has his own amplifying system.

FIRING AT RANDOM

(Continued from page 4)
around whom this year’s aggregation
will be built.

Leaving the other classes behind in
a cloud of dust, the sophomores re-
peated the victory they earned last
year as freshmen, and came out with
flying colors in the inter-class track
competition held last week. However,
they were closely followed by the
freshmen, who pushed them all the
way and conceded defeat only with the
final count. The meet brought out
several new flashes. John Newton, a
junior, showed he is a very able weight
man and is going to push somebody
mighty hard as soon as he is eligible
for varsity competition. Walt Dick-
son was the outstanding star of the
Freshman class, and placed second
only to Evans in total points. Run-
ning the dashes, the high hurdles, and
taking his portion of the high jump
honors, he is an all-round star and will
do more than his share to put the
freshmen out in front. Brown, another
freshman, also showed up well.

HALVERSTADT WINS

The third set was a repetition of
the first and second, with Thompson
fighting for every point only to be run
off court with well-placed drives and
losing the point on Halverstadt over-
heads that were just not gettable. The
match score was 6-0, 6-3, 6-2,
