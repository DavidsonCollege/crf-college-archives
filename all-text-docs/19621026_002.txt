A Return To The Lists

Davidson College is related to
the Presbyterian Church, and thus has
a definite interest in the religious life
of its students. In this respect it is
different from non-church-related col-
leges and universities, and for this
reason students can expect this con-
cern to be concretely demonstrated in
a religious program. ;

A key part of the college’s relig-
ious program is the Sunday night ves-
pers service. We assume that the pur-
pose of this required service is to pro-
vide. a worship experience for Chris-
tian students and to expose non-Chris-
tian students to the Church in a posi-
tive way.

Regretfully. these purposes are
not being satisfactorily met by the
present system. The compulsory na-
ture of the service and the antagonis-
tic attitude of most students towards
it, has made it increasingly difficult
for students to worship if thev wish to
do so. These same factors fyether re-
pel students already discontent with
the Church. ;

In view of this situation. we be-
lieve that some positive proposals for
change should be submitted to the
Board of Trustees at its next meeting.
We urge interested students to make
suggestions, to discuss them, and to
join in an effort to draw up such a
list of proposals. We would like to see
the Y.M.C.A. oversee such action, and
would certainly welcome appropriate
action from the faculty. We think such
a program, drawn-up and presented
by students, would receive serious
consideration at the Trustees meet-

ing. ;
In connection with this, we would

Future Deadwood?

The Student Council has joined
U.S.N.S.A.

If you're asking yourself what
U.S.N.S.A. stands for you have al-
ready justified the major point of this
editorial. It stands for United States
National Student Association. And if
this name means nothing to you, your
ignorance should be a source of con-
cern because the Student Council’s
action means you are a member of
N.S.A. .

The fact is you are not alone in
your ignorance. Most of your repre-
sentatives in the Student Council
seemed similarly uninformed about
the association when they voted to
join it last week. A motion was made
and seconded. There was no discus-
sion. Someone asked, “Is there any-
thing wrong with this organization.”
and someone else assured him there
wasn’t. Then it was quietly passed.

We assume that the members of
the Student Council know that the
NSA has passed resolutions against
H.U.A.C. (it stands for the House on
Un-American Activities Committee),
resumption of nuclear testing by both
the U.S. and the Soviet Union. and the
McCarren Act. We assume that: the
conservatives on the council are aware
that the “Winds From the Right” have
beenshuffing and puffing against this
organization for several years. Most
important we assume the members of
the Student Council are aware of the
association’s conception of the stud-
ents as politically active individuals
and are prepared to support that con-
ception.

Last year the Student Council

The Bible But .

Having been brought up under
rules of fair play, a devotion to
Mother, and a belief that the U. N.
Charter ought to be canonized, at
least, we are completely dismayed by
the spectacular play Uncle Sam is
making presently in the Caribbean.
After all, we have grown so accus-
tomed to losing ground in the inter-
national football arena, or at most
holding desperately onto what is left
of the free world, that it is a trifle
disconcerting when our side doesn’t
drop back and punt—it simply upsets
the natural order of things.

Frankly we are scared silly. Any-

one who is not scared silly is either a
fool or running for Congress.

We are also dismayed. We have
seen the films of Hiroshima, we have

like to point out the following:

Some people have complained
that the ‘past two or three years has
seen a decline in the quality of ves-
pers preachers. (This last Sunday's
preacher was a notable exception.)
We can only assume that the chap-
lain’s office is taking these complaints
into account and is doing its best to
attract the most outstanding preach-
ers available to this campus.

But we do not believe that im-
proving the preaching of the present
services will be enough. We repeat a
suggestion made originally last year,
that provision be made for substitut-
ing attendance at other suitable acti-
vities for vespers attendance.

Certainly attending other off-
campus, or even on-campus, church
services on Sunday ought to be per-
mitted in substitution for attendance
at vespers.

Yet we believe other college-
sponsored programs of a religious na-
ture could be substituted also. Such
programs as plays, movies, and for-
ums are often deeply moving religious
experiences. The  recently-shown
movie “Through a Glass Darkly” and
the Vagabonds'’ religious play and dis-
cussion were two programs which
might have been included under this
proposed system.

Above all, however, we urge all
students to express their concern-and
their opinions on this issue, and to
cooperate with the administration, the
faculty, and the Trustees, in attempt-
ing to make the required weekly re-
ligious service a meaningful exper-
ience fot as many students as possible.

joined the N.S.A. on a temporary
basis presumably because it wanted
to inform the student body, and see
for itself, exactly what kind of organ-
ization N.S.A. was. We heard nothing
about it all year except one speech
on. its foreign exchange program.
Then, as now, only two or three in-
dividuals on campus knew anything
about it.

Frankly we are 100% _ behind
Davidson College joining N.S.A., but
we see dangers in the way the Student
Council has “backed” into it. If this
attitude prevails the council will have
done no more than create another
“deadwood” organization. As Danny
Carrell stated in last vear’s campaign,
“membership in the N.S.A. will have
to be on an all or nothing basis.”

This means that the council
should present to the student body.
and ultimatelv act on itself, all resolu-
tions of the N.S.A. For instance the
N.S.A. is currently carrying on a mas-
sive letter-writing campaign to urge
Ole Miss students to avoid anv further
bloodshed and to protect Meredith.

This means that students should
be allowed to vote on controversial
issues before they are brought up at
the annual. summer conventions.

Guest speakers, a bulletin board,
and columns in the student articles
in THE DAVIDSONIAN; all these are
ways to reach through our provin-
cialism.

The N.S.A. can be, as we have
previously stated, one of the chief
ways of breaking the “apathy-bar-
rier.”

We just hope it gets a chance.

studied our Bibles, we have read of
the wisdom of Ghandi. In fact, we still
hold these things to have a great deal
of validity.

But now we are confronted with
a situation which causes some rever-
sals of our actions, if not our beliefs.
Gee, Mom! They're not playing by the
Queensbury Rules at all!

This sort of thing could give one
grave doubts aobut the completeness
of his education. Perhaps we should
have read Machiavelli instead of Mil-
ton, studied human nature instead of
the Humanities, and above all, not cut
ROTC nearly as much as we did. It’s
almost as if our professors grew up
in a far-off age when nice guys only
finished last.

BY LEE TATSUTA

Japanese Foreign Student

For those who are not blind
because of their self interest,
the complete blockade of West
Berlin is quite reasonable after
the United States blockade of
the open sea of the Caribbean. . .

Two hundred fifty miles off
the mainland of China lies an
istand celled Okinawa, which
has some 600,000 inhabitants.
Okinawa is the most stout
superfort of the world now,
armed with almost all possi-
ble modern weapons. “There
is an unmistakable evidence
of building of offensive mis-
sile sites able to fire inter-
mediate range nuclear rock-
ets” from Okinawa as far as
most parts of China and Siber-
ia of the Soviet Union, That
island surety is a “nettle in
their flesh.”

Historically Okinawa belongs

to Japan. and racially its inhabi- .

tants are the Japanese. How.
ever, the island is under the
strict military administration
of the United States. The in-
habitants are not free to use the
Japanese fleg. and they even
necd a passport and visa to visit
their own motherland.

ples’ own will, though the
reason might be that Okinawa
is an indispensable strategic
island for the defense of the
United States, or one could say,
of the Free Nations.

Can't China or Soviet Rus-
sia be justified, then, in tak-
ing the same steps against
Okinawa as the United States
is now taking against Cube, if
the latter could be justified?

It is very lamentable that a
country which is only 90 miles
from the United States is now
armed with scme offensive mis-
siles. But, let us remember that
the United States has far more
missile sites installed all around
the Soviet Union, some of them
even installed in a country like
Turkey which shares its boun-
dries with the Soviet Union. If
you Americans feel an obses-
sion from the missile sites in
Cuba, how much obsession do
you think the Soviet people
might be feeling?

Why do you see the speck
that is in your “enemy’s” eye,
but do not notice the log that is
in your own eye? Or how can

you say to your “enemy”: “Let
me take the speck out of your
eye,” when there is the log in
your own eye?
if your president were to
repest thet kind of address
several more times, don't you
think many of you would pre
pare to fight at any time, or
prepare to ignore the horrible
fact thet hundreds of millions
of tives, including those of
your mother, sisters, and
flances, would be lost in the
next war?

The headline of the morning
paper on Tuesday was, “US.
READY TO SINK RED SHIP.”
Today in the Soviet Union their
paper might be saying “U.S.S.R.
READY TO SHOOT DOWN
YANKEE PLANE.” At least in
Japan this kind of. talk that ap-
peals to the ignorant ruck can-
not be seen in the public papers.

An openminded attitude
which recognizes the status quo
frankly and quietly with an at-
tenipt to refrain from such pro-
vocative words and actions: such
should be the attitude of a na-
tion that claims to be ‘“Peace-
loving’ and that we expect to
be the leading country of the
free nations.

Jo-as "nd Kitchen: Alike
As Two Peas In A Pod

BY ERNEST F. PATTERSON
Professor of Economics
Julian Scheer, former col-
umnist for the CHARLOTTE
NEWS once wrote that Repre-
sentatives Kitchin and Jonas
were as alike, philosophically
and ideologically, as two peas
in a pod. Any objective and ex-
tensive study of their voting
records and public pronounce-
ments will verify the veracity of
this statement. Both are to be
classed, in the political spec-
trum, as extremely conservative
There is considerable empirical
evidence to support this con-

clusion.

For example, an ultra-conser-
vative organization known as
Americans for Constitutional
Action issues a periodic rating
of members of Congress. Ac-
cording to the CONGRESSION.
AL RECORD “the ACA’s rating
of a ‘good’ Congressional record
is based in part on votes for
‘safeguarding the God-given
dignity of the individual and
promoting sound economic
growth through strengthening
Constitutional government’ and
against ‘collective morality and
a socialized economy through
centralization of power’.”

A member of Congress can
score from 9 fo 100 on the

Goldwater, who only managed
to reach 99!) Representative
Kitchin is a “flaming liberal”
by contrast, having scored only
65! It should be noted that he
ranks higher, or lower, depend-
ing on one's point of view, than
any other member of the North
Carolina Democratic Congress-
men.

The Machinists Union check-
ed the voting record of all Con-
gressmen on 10 key issues, in-
cluding $1.25 minimum wage,
NLRB reorganization, withhold-
ing income taxes on dividends
and interest, school lunch pro-
gram extension, world trade bill,
and emergency public works
bill.

According to the union,
Jonas voted “Right,” I. e.,
agreed with the position of
the union, usually considered
to be a “liberal” one, only
once, as did Kitchin, though
on different issues—Jonas on
8 bill to retrain technological-
ly unemployed, and Kitchin on
the withholding of taxes on
dividends and interest. ...

When one reads Jonas’ and
Kitchin’s speeches in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD on eco-
nomic issues, or hears them
speak in the current campaign,
one is struck by their lack of

understanding of the complex
economic issues facing the
United States today—it is not
necessary to agree with the
solutions which are offered, but
it is essential to know what the
real problems are—and by their
utter failure to recognize and
appreciate the revolution in
economic theory and practice
which has occurred in the West-
ern world since World War I.

Further, when one reads
their pronouncement on for-
eign relations, one is struck
by their failure to grasp the
significance of the technolo-
gical and scientific revolution,
the demographic revolution,
and the revolution of expecte-
thons which cheracterize the
modern world, the impact of
whieh call for a complete
change in our thinking and In
our institutional epproach to
world problems end foreign
relations.

To bring a sad story to an
end, the voters of the 8th North
Carolina Congressional District
have to choose between two
equally conservative and medio-
cre candidates, and the con-
scientious voter is hard put to
find a reasonable and intelligent
basis for choosing between
them.

An Open Letter Home...

Dear Mom and Dad,

I'm sure you saw the Presi-
dent on Monday evening. Ex-
citement over the situation is
rampant here at school, and
everyone eagerly awaits further
developments.

Everybody thinks his home-
town will be high on the list
in case of an attack. Many ex-
aggerate, I'm sure. For in-
‘stance, today a boy from Tal-
ladega, Georgia, brought his
parents here, to the moét isolat-
ed place he could think of, in
case they go after the Talladega
Sprocket and Tool Co. with a
big one.

Speaking of panicking, lots
of rooms have been converted
into fallout shelters, complete
with stores of okra and old

Issues of Playboy. Such shel-
ters are closely guarded and
violent attacks by fraternity
men in search of the invalu-
able okra are generally re-
pelled.

There's been a lot of criticism
of the local confectionaries for
their rather exorbitant rates on
K-Rations, and some boys are
going to Mooresville, to the
Stonestreet Surplus Supply Cen-
ter for better deals. Rush Wil-
son has been enjoying a big re-
vival in the sale of tropical
wear, and the drugstore has
been pushing mosquito spray
and suntan lotion. Pop Copeland
doesn’t haye anything the boys
need for the situation as yet,
but promises to be well-stocked
after his conference with the
Third Army Quartermaster Gen-
eral.

The God and Country theme
prevailed at Thursday chapel,
during which were sung such
inspirational hymns as “Onward,
Christian Soldiers,” “When the
Saints Come Marchin’ In,” and
“It's a Long, Long Way To
Tipperary.” This theme will be
continued at Sunday Vespers,
this time everyone being re-
quired to wear their ROTC uni-
forms (except the intelligence
corps, who will come disguised
as Arabs.)

My roommate stumbled out
of bed earlier than usual this
morning and went out into the
hati, where he encountered
the Observer delivery boy
chanting, “I’d rather be read
than dead!” His statement
was misconstrued by my pe-
triotie roomie, and a terrific
tussle ensued. An economics
prof, after being told of the
incident, is reported to have
exclaimed, “‘Rather ... .
mmmm .. . than dead.’ Say,
that’s a catchy phrase.”

The foreign students today
stormed the. Dean's office, byt
they were subdued by a cordon
of the Honor Guard and threats
from the babyfaced Assistant
Dean to transfer their scholar-
ships to the Union Film Com-
mittee. .

The language Jab has been
turned over to- the Spanish de-
partment, and the chemistry
labs have been devoted to the
manufacure of a poison gas
called Nair, which, if used
against the Cuban leaders, will
destroy their public image a-
mong their people.

Tuesday drill was held at
Lake Norman, the drill re-
ference was amphibious land-
ings. E Company disappeared,
and the ROTC department has
threatened to keep their ten-
doller deposits if they don’t
bring back their weapons and
shoes by tomorrow. The arm-
ory has been locked since
Wednesday, when it was dis-
covered that a colonel in the
Peon Army was giving the
trigger housing groups detail.
ed inspections with White
Rose jelly and Log Cabin
maple syrup.

The Union rings with march-
ing music, student wives are
planting victory gardens, and
the faculty today votes on
whether Regular Army ROTC
officers called to emergency
duty elsewhere will continue to
be responsible for their lesson
plans.

The Fox Drive-In is featuring
“A Night At A Cuban Missile
Base.” Hattie is featuring a
new Cuban beer, Nationalized
Bohemian, and the Veterans Ad-
ministration has applied for a
house on the fraternity court.
Last night the literary societies
debated the question “Should
we remember the Alamo or the
Maine?”

The Queens giris have all
been campused because: 1)
Tuesday night they rictously
toasted Americen success in
the Caribbean with flagons
of Cheerwine; and 2) It is
well known that they are ail
so devoted to Davidson boys
thet if these boys were celled
away by Uncle Sam, the girls
would desperately follow
them.

The IFC announced that Mid-
Winters concerts might be dif-
ficult to arrange because most
good acts will probably be doing
USO engagements. However, the
Thirteen Screaming Negroes
combo have notified us that they
have all failed their physicals
and will be available.

Its rumored that the sur-
rounding military institutes are
unable to assist very much in
the Caribbean action due to
their strenuous athletic sched-
ules, but I’m sure many David-
sonians will render valuable
service. If the papers stop com-
ing in and radio goes dead, we
only ask to be buried with our
Weejuns on.

Your loving son,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Are Football Players
Christian Gentlemen?

Dear Editor:

Sports Editor Bill Pridgen
made a very alarming sugges-
tion in his editorial of last week.

We must infer from his col-
umn that some of the Davidson
football players are neither
“gentlemen” (about football)
nor Christians. It comes as a
great shock and disillusionment
to certain members of the col-
lege community to discover that
the official representatives of
Davidson (a Christien college)
might not themselves be Chris-
tians.

This is a serious matter, and
perhaps should be investigat-
ed jointly by the Faculty Exe-
cutive Committee and the
YMCA.

Maybe the members of the
team should be required to take
the faculty oath before they are
allowed to play football.

David Suter

Dear Editor:

The purpose of this letter is
to explain the protest we made
this past Sunday in vespers. We
were not demonstrating against
required religious services. As
a church-related college, David-
son has a responsibility to the
church to include religious serv-
ices in the student's life.

Our protest was against the
form of these services. We feel
they do not communicate with
the students. The result is that
many are turned against the
church.

The dress was symbolic of
our criticism. The ROTC uni-

form represented the regi-
mentation and organization
which sre choking the
church’s real message. Our
services of hymns, scripture
readings, and sermons heve
become an end in themselves
rather than the means to un-
derstand God's word.

The prophet’s garb was meant
to show that there exists the
same difference between the
dress of the early Christian and
the modern churchman as there
does between the early church
and the modern church. We
feel the Love of the early
church has been lost. We have
dressed the church to suit our-
selves; made it respectable. In
the process the excitement of a
living faith hag been replaced
with the cold pallor of a dying
faith.

Our demonstration was an ef-
fort to show concern for the
church.
