Twelve Faculty Members
See India During Summer

By THOMAS AINSWORTH
Staff Writer
This past summer, from mid-
July to the beginning of Sep-

tember, 12 members of the
Davidson faculty toured the
sub-continent of India in a

seminar-type program sponsor-
ed by the college.

The program started in New
Delhi with a tour of that city,
followed by a series of lectures
over the next three weeks in
various areas of interest such
as contemporary Indian religi-
ous life, society structure, In-
dian literature, economy. gov-
ernment, and everything from
industry and agriculture to for-
eign policy.

A short distance away in
Agra, the group visited the
famous Taj Mahal and Red
Fort, and also stopped at sev-

eral local villages in the area
to view firsthand this unique
communal experience.

“This should prove to the
Davidson community that In-
dia is not just a place where
one is likely to get some hor-
rible Asian disease,” said In-
structor in Asian Studies Fred-
erich H. Gaige.

“India is not so far away or
so different that the members
of the Davidson community
cannot come to grips with it
intellectually.”

Other accounts from the mem-
bers of the group held inter-
esting and diverse impressions.

of economics. recalled wit-

lems, a sort of “Holy Roller”

The Budget, Building and

Activity Increases On Court

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

Activity on Patterson Frater-
nity Court increased this week

as freshmen began eating at

their assigned houses and as
students established a free-form
theater in the vacant SPE
house.

This was the first in a five-
week eating period. after which
the freshmen will be rotated in-
to another house. This process

will continue until the latter half _

of the spring term, at which
time the freshman will self-
select into one of the half dozen
houses that he has visited.

The numerica! breakdown for
this first period is as follows:
Alpha Tau Omega will receive
31 freshmen; Beta Theta Pi, 34;
Kappa Alpha, 32; Kappa Sigma.
33; Phi Delta Theta, 34; Pi
Kappa Alpha, 36: Pi Kappa Phi.
23; Rho Alpha Chi (PAX), 27;
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 27; Ran-
dom House (Sigma Nu), 26.

Dean of Students Will H. Ter-
ry said that he was ‘'‘pleased
with the cooperation of the fra-
ternity presidents"’ and that he
anticipated no problems as far
-ag tension within the houses.

Terry said in this first five-
week period there had been an
effort to keep freshmen advisor
groups on the halls together
when possible, and that stu-
dents on a hall were often
assigned to a house where their
ball counselor was eating to
give-them some connection with
the house.

In some cases,
at numerical balance. Terry’
added that as the program
smooths out, the college may
be able to institute the random

however,
groups were.split up to achieve , -

assignment with the computer.

The number of freshmen eat-
ing at any one meal and the
days for these meals was left
up to the individual houses to
decide. Some have their groups
eating only on Monday and
Tuesday while other houses
have spread. their groups out
over the week.

The college is paying a flat-
rate fee of $1.93 to the houses
for each freshman to eat the
two. meals each week.

There has been some shift-
ing around on the fraternity
court since the institution of
the new social system last
year.

The local SPEs are present-
ly eating in the old Sigma Chi
house, leaving the old house
vacant. The Phi Gamm house
is also vacant, though still furn-
ished, pending the decision of
nationals ever off-campus plans.

In a last-minute arrangement
last Tuesday night National
Sig Eps self-selected into the
old Sigma Nu house in order to
eat on campus.

Town zoning laws and_ the
comprehensive fee which will
go into effect next year have
discouraged ‘all groups inter-
ested in off-campus dining

The first attempt to set up
a function on Patterson Court
other than a social one is also

in progress as a group of stu-
dents work to turn the old SPE
house into a theatre.

“It's just an experiment.”
said senior Jack Scott. heading
the project along with senior
Terry Hirst. “‘We want to pro-
vide an added facility for stu-
dents who want to write. an-
other outlet for those who want
a chance to try something out."'

Scott said that the group al-
ready has their own lighting
equipment. and that it and the
use of the theatre fs offered to
anyone who needs it, students
or faculty included.

There is a possibility that fu-
ture drama workshops will also
be held in the new theatre.

“One of the things that ap-
peals to me is that we have
wanted to build houses on Pat-
terson Court based not just on
social compatibility but on mut-
ual interest,’ Terry said.

The agreement to use the
house as a theatre is good for
a seven-month period, and the
students in charge are respon-
sible for paying for the utili-
ties.

‘Scott said that regardless of
the agreement he has decided
to apply for money from Activi-
ties Fund to help cover the
overhead for the house, which
amounts to about $30 per
month.

*‘What we need to do is to
make sure all faculty are there
and voting,” he said. ‘We also
will make sure that the faculty
sees all the material from the
survey that Mr. White helped
us compile. That’s all we can
do.”

Concerning the Budget, Build-
ing and Grounds proposal
Clodfelter said he understood
that the faculty was concerned
about adding students to this
committee at'a time when the
faculty is concerned about fin-
ancial matters, especially sal-
aries.

“What we will do is to try
to persuade the faculty that
students on the committee will
provide joint action on student
and faculty concerns,’ Clod-
felter said.

type of sect.

Professor of Chemistry Jam-
es M. Fredericksen comment-
ed that even though at one
time almost half of the group
was down with some kind of
illness, it wasn as serious as
it might have been.

“TI thought I was going to see
massive starvation everywhere,
but didn’t,” he said. ““Knowing
what I know now, I could face
the situation again.”

The matter of filth in the
streets was echoed by Profes-
sor of Political Science Win-
fred P. Minter as he described
an incident in Hyderabad
where a cow walked into the
lobby of their hotel and really
didn’t cause a great deal of
concern.

Mixed philosophies seemed to
abound in the various recollec-
tions. One had to be impressed
by the fact that having come
from the wealthiest and most
affluent nation in the world,
one was entering probably the
poorest.

“It was an opportunity to
see part of the underdeveloped
world trying to solve some of
their problems’ said Minter.
“India is not really that exo-
tic,” he continued. ‘‘The typical
man on the street is just about
the same as anywhere.”

To Assistant Professor of Psy-
chology Palmer it was a *‘com-
bination of both optimism and
pessimism. When you see the
experiments and progress they
are achieving in agriculture
and industry, you can’t help
but be hopeful.

“Yet when the contrast be-
tween the wealthy and the poor
becomes so obvious, you can’t
heip but become pessimistic
again,” he said.
