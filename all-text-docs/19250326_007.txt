PROF. WACHTER PLEASES

(Continued from page 1)

Mrs. Baker was the piano accompanist
for Mr. Neal. Her ability as such could
have been no better illustrated than in this
performance and her association with
the Davidson College Glee Club as director
during the past fall. At the conclusion of
Mr. Neal's rendition Mandalay, .Mrs
Baker led the audience in the singing of the
chorus of this popular poem of the English
author,

in

of

Professor Wachter's readings consisted of
Gunga Din, Chant Pagan, The Explorer,
Cape Horn Gospel, by Masefield : Tomlinson,
<1 Code of Morals, The Answer, Dedication
of Barrack Room Ballads, and two poems of
his own writing, The Happy Man and
Shakespeare's Return. He told one inter-
esting incident concerning the latter poem in
which a certain member the Davidson
faculty, upon hearing the poem read, would
not be convinced that it was not one of
Shakespeare’s own-intil he had carefully in-
vestigated the works of that author. Too
much can not be said as to the perfection
and delightfulness of Professor Wachter’s
impersonations. One was forced to keep his
Wits about him lest he fall under the spell of
the reader and think himself in the presence
of a British soldier in far India or a British
tar rounding Cape Horn.

This recital did two things for Davidson's
campus. It aroused in the boys here a high-
cr appreciation of the value and the place
in literary history of the great British poet,
Rudyard Kipling, and it made forever per-
manent the place held by Prof. Carl Wach-
ter in the hearts and respect of the students
here.
